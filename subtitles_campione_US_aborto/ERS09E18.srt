1
00:00:05,233 --> 00:00:06,233
Previously on "ER."

2
00:00:06,266 --> 00:00:07,333
I'll take him up myself.

3
00:00:07,366 --> 00:00:09,033
Dr. Romano, your arm.

4
00:00:10,233 --> 00:00:11,566
Damn it!

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,633
I'm fine.
Let's just, let's go.

6
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:17,700
Let's roll.

7
00:00:17,733 --> 00:00:19,300
We're going to
Las Vegas tonight.

8
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:21,100
Are you ready?

9
00:00:21,133 --> 00:00:22,366
I've asked
Robert to consider

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,233
sharing the chief of staff
position with you.

11
00:00:25,266 --> 00:00:27,033
I'd rather cut
off my good arm.

12
00:00:27,066 --> 00:00:29,366
Fine. Congratulations, Kerry.

13
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,333
You've just become
chief of staff.

14
00:00:47,566 --> 00:00:49,500
That was a gift.

15
00:00:49,533 --> 00:00:52,333
From a grateful patient?

16
00:00:52,366 --> 00:00:54,266
Grateful girlfriend.

17
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,633
I have a few meetings
with department heads later.

18
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:58,100
Otherwise, I
would have waited.

19
00:00:58,133 --> 00:01:00,766
Oh, yeah, of course.

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,733
I'll have all this sent
to your home by week's end.

21
00:01:03,766 --> 00:01:05,200
‐ Dr. Weaver?
‐ Yeah.

22
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:07,066
‐ Maintenance is here.
‐ Send him in.

23
00:01:08,266 --> 00:01:10,366
What happened
to Brenda?

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,633
We had to let her go.

25
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:16,400
She seemed unwilling
to make the transition.

26
00:01:16,433 --> 00:01:18,166
'Centered, right above
the backs of the chairs'

27
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,500
and at museum level.

28
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,566
Oh, museum level

29
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,433
Always hated
the Impressionists.

30
00:01:26,466 --> 00:01:28,533
Look, it's a lateral
move, Robert.

31
00:01:28,566 --> 00:01:30,100
All that sugarcoating
of the truth.

32
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:32,500
Believe me,
it wasn't my idea.

33
00:01:32,533 --> 00:01:34,300
Dr. Anspaugh
thought it might be

34
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:36,400
a good interim step.

35
00:01:36,433 --> 00:01:38,333
That's strange,
because this little power play

36
00:01:38,366 --> 00:01:40,566
smacks of a certain
estrogen‐based malice

37
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,233
I've grown all too familiar
with over the years.

38
00:01:42,266 --> 00:01:44,233
You know..

39
00:01:44,266 --> 00:01:47,033
...I really wish you'd
try to appreciate the fact

40
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:48,700
that we're trying
to do you a favor here.

41
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,333
What you're doing
is bending me over

42
00:01:50,366 --> 00:01:51,766
and driving it up
the chocolate highway.

43
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,066
Let's be honest.

44
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,733
You're a one‐handed
surgeon, Robert.

45
00:01:56,766 --> 00:02:00,033
Not to mention a human
resources nightmare

46
00:02:00,066 --> 00:02:03,300
'and a lousy administrator
who's burned more bridges'

47
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:05,166
than you've ever built.

48
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,666
You're lucky to
have options at all.

49
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,266
Oh, you're
suggesting I have some.

50
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,733
Yes, you do. You have three.

51
00:02:09,766 --> 00:02:12,666
It's this, it's
teaching or it's out.

52
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,800
Oh, Dr. Romano, can I
get your home address?

53
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:21,733
Bite me, Nancy.

54
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,533
Dr. Romano, I have
some billing givebacks

55
00:02:23,566 --> 00:02:24,566
from Anesthesiology‐‐

56
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,666
Not my job.

57
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,300
Cardio admin's
on line one for you.

58
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:29,666
‐ Take a message.
‐ Well, what do I tell them?

59
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,566
That I don't work here anymore.

60
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,700
'What are you doing?'

61
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:49,166
I'm taking Mrs. Tucker to x‐ray.

62
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,666
That's what orderlies are for.

63
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,366
Park granny and go help
someone drain an abscess.

64
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,666
‐ Yeah, but I got‐‐
‐ You're a med student.

65
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,500
You're not doing scut,
you're not doing squat.

66
00:02:55,533 --> 00:02:58,166
Hey, green card, I want all your
performance evals by day's end.

67
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,433
Why?

68
00:02:59,466 --> 00:03:01,066
I want something to read
when I'm on the can.

69
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,533
Why do you think, Igor?
You're on my hit list.

70
00:03:02,566 --> 00:03:03,700
Who supplies
the nurses' scrubs?

71
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:05,366
‐ Allied.
‐ Switch to Lindeman's.

72
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,133
They hug booty better.

73
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,266
What the hell are
you looking at?

74
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,366
Oh, hey, hey, hey,
everybody! Great news!

75
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,100
Pinata out in the parking
lot. Andale, andale.

76
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:14,400
They're here for
one of their kids.

77
00:03:14,433 --> 00:03:15,733
Yeah? Well, they need
to stop having kids.

78
00:03:15,766 --> 00:03:17,666
‐ Clear 'em out or you're fired.
‐ What?

79
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,333
Let me rephrase that.
You're fired.

80
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,166
‐ You can't fire nurses.
‐ I just did.

81
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,166
‐ Hey, pituitary boy.
‐ You talking to me?

82
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,100
Yeah, I lost my arm,
not my olfactory nerve.

83
00:03:25,133 --> 00:03:27,066
Sic security on the bum
taking a crap over there

84
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,100
and get me a list of
every staff member's salary

85
00:03:29,133 --> 00:03:30,333
including yours.

86
00:03:30,366 --> 00:03:31,533
What was that
all about?

87
00:03:31,566 --> 00:03:33,133
Meet the new boss.

88
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,766
And get rid of this
coffee machine in here!

89
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,133
You losers can pay
for your own java!

90
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,766
Oh, at times
like this

91
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,500
I wish I practiced
in Florida.

92
00:04:34,533 --> 00:04:37,500
Nah, it's too humid.
Plus, you'd miss me.

93
00:04:37,533 --> 00:04:38,700
Huh, well, I wouldn't
miss the wind chill.

94
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:40,800
Hey, Dr. Chen, how many candles?

95
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:43,433
Hey, I said no cake.

96
00:04:43,466 --> 00:04:44,600
Happy birthday,
Jing‐Mei.

97
00:04:44,633 --> 00:04:46,200
Like you even knew.

98
00:04:46,233 --> 00:04:47,666
‐ Yes, I did.
‐ Uh‐huh.

99
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,400
And I got you something.

100
00:04:49,433 --> 00:04:51,033
‐ Really?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

101
00:04:51,066 --> 00:04:52,533
And I figured if you
weren't busy later

102
00:04:52,566 --> 00:04:55,233
I would take you
over to the Grotto

103
00:04:55,266 --> 00:04:57,033
and we'd get some
champagne afterwards.

104
00:04:57,066 --> 00:04:59,400
Ooh, you thought this
through, didn't you?

105
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:00,633
Yes, indeed.
Why wouldn't I?

106
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:01,766
How you doing?

107
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,233
CDs, jewelry
and personal accessories

108
00:05:04,266 --> 00:05:05,566
all at discount rates.

109
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,666
Uh, no, thanks.

110
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,466
Ladies lo‐o‐ove stuffed animals.

111
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,233
Five bucks for
this little cutie.

112
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:12,100
‐ Don't make me hurt you.
‐ Hey, hey, this is America.

113
00:05:12,133 --> 00:05:13,233
If you can't sell
crap on the street

114
00:05:13,266 --> 00:05:14,333
then we're not a free society.

115
00:05:14,366 --> 00:05:15,733
Come on, get
out of my way.

116
00:05:15,766 --> 00:05:18,166
Okay, I should be back
by six. She woke up early.

117
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,100
So make sure she
takes a nap, okay?

118
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:22,100
Hey, hey, you like
the sign I put up?

119
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,500
Yeah, yeah. It's, uh, sweet.

120
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:28,633
Okay, my darling, bye‐bye.

121
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,633
Hey, kids love
stuffed animals.

122
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,233
'Five bucks for
this little cutie.'

123
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:33,733
‐ No, thank you.
‐ It also comes in pink.

124
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:36,133
‐ You're scaring her.
‐ I got dolls in here too.

125
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,733
Go, go!

126
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,566
My foot! My foo‐o‐ot!

127
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,166
Told Haleh
she was fired.

128
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,700
Said it was
a management tool.

129
00:05:47,733 --> 00:05:49,300
Always fire someone
the first day.

130
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,033
Lets them know who's boss.

131
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:52,233
He can call himself king

132
00:05:52,266 --> 00:05:53,400
as long as I get severance.

133
00:05:53,433 --> 00:05:54,633
Hey, Abby, can you park

134
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,300
Mrs. Strohm here in Exam One?

135
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,366
Uh, no.

136
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,533
We lost another exam room.

137
00:05:59,566 --> 00:06:01,400
We'll park her in the hall.

138
00:06:01,433 --> 00:06:03,133
Weaver never had an office.

139
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:05,133
Said he'd take the lounge
if we're not careful.

140
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,500
And put our lockers where?

141
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,233
‐ Triage?
‐ Oh, that's great.

142
00:06:08,266 --> 00:06:10,433
So, now our personal
stuff can get stolen too.

143
00:06:10,466 --> 00:06:11,600
Too late.

144
00:06:11,633 --> 00:06:12,700
Brand new leather gloves

145
00:06:12,733 --> 00:06:14,133
right out of my locker.

146
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,200
Real leather?

147
00:06:15,233 --> 00:06:16,266
Yeah. Why?

148
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,666
Animals died to make them.

149
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,633
Right, and we should
all wear canvas shoes.

150
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,300
Oh, Go‐o‐od!

151
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,333
I could use
a little help here.

152
00:06:24,366 --> 00:06:25,533
'What happened?'

153
00:06:25,566 --> 00:06:27,333
Corday's nanny
ran over his foot.

154
00:06:27,366 --> 00:06:29,533
With her freakin' minivan.
I'm crippled.

155
00:06:29,566 --> 00:06:31,133
How did this
become your problem?

156
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,233
Elizabeth decided
that it was an ER case.

157
00:06:33,266 --> 00:06:34,733
Yeah, it's typical.
We got any open beds?

158
00:06:34,766 --> 00:06:36,166
'Yeah, if he's
a paying customer.'

159
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,500
Otherwise, park him in the hall.

160
00:06:37,533 --> 00:06:39,300
For anyone late
for his or her shift

161
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,566
be advised that
I am now in charge

162
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,733
of this human cesspool.

163
00:06:41,766 --> 00:06:42,800
Say goodbye to the warm fuzzies

164
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,200
of the Weaver era and hello

165
00:06:44,233 --> 00:06:45,233
to the age of efficiency

166
00:06:45,266 --> 00:06:46,333
and cost effectiveness.

167
00:06:46,366 --> 00:06:48,133
Future tardiness will result

168
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:50,166
in a docked paycheck
and/or letter to file.

169
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,300
And once you do get to work
on time, you will treat

170
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,500
you will street
and you will do so

171
00:06:53,533 --> 00:06:54,633
as quickly as humanly possible.

172
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,166
Any questions?
Didn't think so.

173
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,400
Medivac, two minutes out.
Auto versus ped.

174
00:06:58,433 --> 00:07:00,700
Kovac and Carter. Keep
dispositions under 20 minutes.

175
00:07:00,733 --> 00:07:03,266
Doctors Lewis, Chen and Pratt
can focus on clearing the board

176
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,633
and you can get me
a breakfast burrito

177
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:06,333
extra cheese,
hold the salsa.

178
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:08,766
‐ Please?
‐ Get your love at home.

179
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,533
Should be interesting.

180
00:07:15,566 --> 00:07:17,500
Romano in charge.

181
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:23,533
Seen any
movies lately?

182
00:07:23,566 --> 00:07:24,633
Nope.

183
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,800
Tried that sushi place
at Navy Pier yet?

184
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,566
No.

185
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,400
It's good.

186
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,400
Long time now..

187
00:07:41,433 --> 00:07:43,500
...that you've been
together, yeah? A year?

188
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,000
Almost.

189
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,566
That's nice.

190
00:07:54,633 --> 00:07:56,466
Josh Rushing, 37.

191
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,766
Found him down
along old Route Ten

192
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,233
outside of Pembroke.

193
00:07:59,266 --> 00:08:00,500
Long way from
County, huh?

194
00:08:00,533 --> 00:08:02,033
Busy day. We go
where they tell us.

195
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:04,066
Scalp lac,
multiple contusions.

196
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,133
Probable hit‐and‐run.
He's suffering from exposure.

197
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,666
Been down a while. Homeless?

198
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,300
After a couple of days out
everybody looks homeless.

199
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,033
Is Susan Lewis
working today?

200
00:08:12,066 --> 00:08:13,366
Yeah. Why?

201
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,233
Jackknifed rig on the Dan Ryan

202
00:08:15,266 --> 00:08:17,266
with an SUV
trapped underneath.

203
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,633
Damn it, we gotta go!

204
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:21,766
Okay, on my count.
One, two, three.

205
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,166
CBC, lytes, BUN and creatinine.
Let's get an Accu‐Chek.

206
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,166
Wallet says he's
an accountant from Indiana.

207
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,600
What's he doing walking
the back roads of Illinois?

208
00:08:29,633 --> 00:08:31,133
Got a clavicle
deformity on the left.

209
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,033
Maybe he was exercising.

210
00:08:33,066 --> 00:08:35,300
Eighteen in the right
AC with a liter up.

211
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,433
Accu‐Chek is, uh, 96.

212
00:08:37,466 --> 00:08:39,800
‐ Not in loafers.
‐ Pretty isolated out that way.

213
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,066
Lucky they
found him at all.

214
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,400
Alright, what do we got?

215
00:08:42,433 --> 00:08:44,400
We got a possible
car versus pedestrian.

216
00:08:44,433 --> 00:08:45,600
Vitals stable
but unresponsive.

217
00:08:45,633 --> 00:08:47,133
This is why I went to med school

218
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,600
so I could practice
veterinary medicine.

219
00:08:48,633 --> 00:08:50,033
On the monitor.
Systolic, 96.

220
00:08:50,066 --> 00:08:51,566
‐ SonoSite.
‐ Both lungs are up.

221
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,400
‐ He doesn't need a chest tube.
‐ I'll be the judge of that.

222
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:55,533
Dr. Kovac, a call
for you on line one.

223
00:08:55,566 --> 00:08:57,366
‐ Not in the middle of a trauma.
‐ Who is it?

224
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,700
It's a collect
person‐to‐person from Zagreb.

225
00:08:59,733 --> 00:09:02,200
‐ 'No blood in Morrison's.'
‐ Your dad?

226
00:09:02,233 --> 00:09:03,433
'No free fluid,
no pericardial‐‐'

227
00:09:03,466 --> 00:09:04,466
Someone named Gordana.

228
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,733
Nothing. Catch.

229
00:09:05,766 --> 00:09:08,500
‐ May I? Hello.
‐ 'Hello.'

230
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:10,566
Uh, don't ever call
this number again.

231
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,633
Why did you do that?

232
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:12,666
Hey, you want to chew the fat

233
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,700
with the peasants back home dial

234
00:09:13,733 --> 00:09:15,233
Ten‐Ten‐Call‐the‐Third World.

235
00:09:15,266 --> 00:09:17,700
Okay, C‐spine, chest
and pelvis to start.

236
00:09:17,733 --> 00:09:20,200
'He needs a rectal.'

237
00:09:20,233 --> 00:09:21,566
Oh, um..

238
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,633
...I took the liberty of
checking the union manual.

239
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,166
You can't fire nurses.

240
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,700
They have their own
administrative authority.

241
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,633
You have to lodge a complaint
with the nurse manager.

242
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,600
Fine. Tell Hally, or whatever
her name is, that she can stay.

243
00:09:31,633 --> 00:09:34,633
‐ She already went home.
‐ Uh, fine. Good, good, good.

244
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,200
Then have her come back,
but make sure she deducts

245
00:09:36,233 --> 00:09:37,333
for the time she was gone.

246
00:09:37,366 --> 00:09:38,766
And give me
bullet points on who

247
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,033
I can pink slip,
and for what reasons.

248
00:09:41,066 --> 00:09:42,433
There are six unions
on the floor.

249
00:09:42,466 --> 00:09:44,400
That's 12 volumes
of material.

250
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:46,300
Fine, do yours last.

251
00:09:47,566 --> 00:09:48,800
Dr. Lewis.

252
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,566
So what's the story here?

253
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,066
Sammy got ahold
of dad's nail gun.

254
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,466
Who knew he'd use
it as a weapon?

255
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,100
He's a seven‐year‐old boy.
Everything's a weapon.

256
00:09:57,133 --> 00:09:58,133
This the nail gun injury?

257
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,566
Yeah.

258
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,233
Well, Dr. Corday's
got this now.

259
00:10:02,266 --> 00:10:04,366
Apparently, Sammy
didn't think it was loaded.

260
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,366
No. I knew.

261
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:12,500
Well, the puncture appears
to have glanced off the rib.

262
00:10:12,533 --> 00:10:14,066
You'll be fine.

263
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,600
DT and a gram of Ancef?

264
00:10:15,633 --> 00:10:17,266
Yeah.

265
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,500
And, uh..

266
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:21,766
...a psych consult
for the son, perhaps.

267
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,200
So, how's it
going down here?

268
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:24,500
Want to hear
something scary?

269
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:26,066
I miss Weaver.

270
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:35,266
Fresh pot.

271
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,700
Enjoy it while you can.

272
00:10:37,733 --> 00:10:40,066
‐ How you doing?
‐ Very well, thanks.

273
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,200
New digs, new challenges,
crappy coffee.

274
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:43,500
Interest you in a cup?

275
00:10:43,533 --> 00:10:45,366
I'll pass.

276
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,566
Smart woman.

277
00:10:48,266 --> 00:10:51,333
Look, I think it's awful,
just to let you know.

278
00:10:51,366 --> 00:10:52,733
A waste..

279
00:10:52,766 --> 00:10:56,666
...really, of your, of
your skills, your talents.

280
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,266
But, um, I'm sure
it will be temporary.

281
00:11:00,566 --> 00:11:01,533
Yeah.

282
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,100
Anything I
can do to help?

283
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,366
You could shoot me now.

284
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,500
BP's stable 120/78,
and the tox screen's back.

285
00:11:15,533 --> 00:11:18,133
No drugs or alcohol
in his system, crit's 50.

286
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:21,100
Hemo concentrated.
Neuro exam looks non‐focal.

287
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:24,100
I don't know, on his own, no car

288
00:11:24,133 --> 00:11:26,066
out in the middle of nowhere.

289
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,200
Think he was robbed?

290
00:11:27,233 --> 00:11:29,433
Still had his
wallet with him.

291
00:11:29,466 --> 00:11:31,766
Maybe he got dumped.
I don't know.

292
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,766
Maybe his
wife knows.

293
00:11:35,266 --> 00:11:36,433
He's wearing
a wedding ring.

294
00:11:36,466 --> 00:11:38,066
They're trying
to track her down.

295
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,633
Hundred of thiamine,
just in case.

296
00:11:42,533 --> 00:11:45,033
‐ Did you know about it?
‐ What?

297
00:11:45,066 --> 00:11:47,100
‐ The Romano coup d'etat.
‐ No idea.

298
00:11:47,133 --> 00:11:49,133
‐ Does it mean anything?
‐ Yeah, we're screwed.

299
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,033
'Push the admin meeting to four'

300
00:11:51,066 --> 00:11:53,100
'and tell the alderman
I'm out of the office.'

301
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,400
Dr. Weaver.

302
00:11:55,433 --> 00:11:57,066
John, I have to turn over

303
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,066
a number of
outstanding projects.

304
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,066
Resident's time study.

305
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,500
A Q/A of our portable
ultrasound training.

306
00:12:04,533 --> 00:12:07,733
I‐I‐I'd be really grateful
if you'd see them through.

307
00:12:07,766 --> 00:12:09,400
‐ Sure.
‐ Excellent.

308
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,233
So..

309
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:14,200
...how long is Romano
going to be down here?

310
00:12:15,466 --> 00:12:17,566
What makes you think
it's not permanent?

311
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,133
Because whoever
runs the department

312
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:21,233
has to have good communication
and clinical skills.

313
00:12:21,266 --> 00:12:23,800
He is, uh..

314
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,766
He's an experienced physician.

315
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,233
His background
is entirely surgical.

316
00:12:27,266 --> 00:12:28,733
John..

317
00:12:28,766 --> 00:12:30,600
...you have to be
associate professor before

318
00:12:30,633 --> 00:12:33,033
you can be considered
for department head.

319
00:12:33,066 --> 00:12:34,366
I don't want
his job, Kerry.

320
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,333
I just don't want to
have to do two of them.

321
00:12:40,533 --> 00:12:42,100
Alright.

322
00:12:42,133 --> 00:12:45,133
Which one of you
smartasses stole my crutch?

323
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,133
Do you have any
plans for tonight?

324
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,200
Oh, me and this
guy named TiVo.

325
00:12:51,233 --> 00:12:53,766
We're going to curl up
in front of the TV. You?

326
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,000
Nah.

327
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,233
Everything okay?

328
00:13:00,266 --> 00:13:03,066
Woman I went to med school with
has a patient who's very sick.

329
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,166
Young boy.

330
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,033
Is he terminal?

331
00:13:06,066 --> 00:13:09,133
Post shunt tetralogy
with pulmonary atresia.

332
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,700
‐ Oh.
‐ He's outgrowing the shunts.

333
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:13,400
He needs unifoc
and complete repair.

334
00:13:13,433 --> 00:13:15,066
That's a pretty
specialized procedure.

335
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,133
Yup, so special
it can't be done there.

336
00:13:18,566 --> 00:13:20,300
Nicky Broomer,
fell while running.

337
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,633
Shoulder dislocation
and probable rib fracture.

338
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,633
Vitals normal except
for pulse of 120.

339
00:13:26,233 --> 00:13:28,700
‐ This guy's a runner?
‐ He's a junkie.

340
00:13:28,733 --> 00:13:30,466
He gets chased by the cops
on a regular basis.

341
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,533
He fell on the sidewalk,
alright? It was wet.

342
00:13:32,566 --> 00:13:33,700
Are you high
now, Nicky?

343
00:13:33,733 --> 00:13:35,766
No, and he's
staying that way.

344
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,666
Mint condition.
The entire lot.

345
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,266
The sky's the limit
as far as mark up

346
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,033
and the whole shebang's
yours for only 30 bucks.

347
00:13:41,066 --> 00:13:42,300
Hey.

348
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,500
I thought you said
you couldn't walk

349
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:45,100
your foot hurt so bad.

350
00:13:45,133 --> 00:13:46,233
I hopped.

351
00:13:47,433 --> 00:13:48,700
I'm on the phone here.

352
00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:50,233
Yeah, take two Tylenol
every four hours

353
00:13:50,266 --> 00:13:51,633
and get a real job.

354
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,666
‐ Hey, it's at 3 o'clock.
‐ What?

355
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,100
‐ Cake for Chen.
‐ Oh, right, right.

356
00:13:56,133 --> 00:13:58,066
So, Chuny, what do you
think? Flowers or candy?

357
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,166
Ah, it's gotta be something she
can wear or what's the point?

358
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,500
Okay, let's see who's
losing the dispo race.

359
00:14:02,533 --> 00:14:04,733
Why, that would
be...Dr. Pratt

360
00:14:04,766 --> 00:14:06,700
who will now be punished
for his indolent ways.

361
00:14:06,733 --> 00:14:08,433
Lower back pain in two

362
00:14:08,466 --> 00:14:10,466
and an unknown intestinal
disturbance in four.

363
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,766
Chop, chop.

364
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,233
In second to last place
we have Dr. Lewis.

365
00:14:14,266 --> 00:14:16,166
Well, that's to be expected
from one who ovulates.

366
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,266
She gets the maggot
infestation in two.

367
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,433
And then, of course,
we have Mr. Gallant

368
00:14:20,466 --> 00:14:22,666
who's doing Cadillac
work ups on Yugo patients.

369
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,100
How are you, hun?
Don't tell me. Don't tell me.

370
00:14:25,133 --> 00:14:27,800
Says right here,
"My blood pressure is high."

371
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,100
Well, hell, so is mine.

372
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:30,400
But rather than
go to a busy ER

373
00:14:30,433 --> 00:14:32,166
I stay home and take
my prescribed medication.

374
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,433
Have you tried
that at all?

375
00:14:33,466 --> 00:14:34,566
She's also diabetic
and her EKG is‐‐

376
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,233
Is entirely unnecessary.

377
00:14:36,266 --> 00:14:38,300
Give he a sublingual nifedipine
and send her to clinic.

378
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:39,666
Yeah, but that's not a‐‐

379
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,133
Are you filling some
sort of special needs

380
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,233
quota here, Mr. Gallant?

381
00:14:42,266 --> 00:14:43,300
You need me to say it slowly

382
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,600
in the language of your people?

383
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:47,166
Sublingual nifedipine.

384
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,733
And when you're done
with her, pick up six more.

385
00:14:48,766 --> 00:14:51,800
She's your patient,
not your mother.

386
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,433
They letting any bottom
feeder with a check

387
00:14:53,466 --> 00:14:54,800
into med school these days?

388
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,400
Actually, Gallant is one
of our best med students.

389
00:14:56,433 --> 00:14:57,800
Well, that doesn't
bode well for the future

390
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,400
of emergency medicine,
but maybe by the time

391
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:00,700
he gets his license
we'll all be dead.

392
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,466
Uh, typically,
as chief resident

393
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,233
I assign the med
students their cases.

394
00:15:04,266 --> 00:15:06,500
Ah, when?
Every other Tuesday?

395
00:15:06,533 --> 00:15:08,266
Any patient here over
six hours is a failure

396
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,733
of your management skills,
not mine. Treat, turf, or dispo.

397
00:15:10,766 --> 00:15:12,033
With all due respect,
you don't have

398
00:15:12,066 --> 00:15:13,433
a background
in emergency medicine

399
00:15:13,466 --> 00:15:15,266
and quite frankly,
it isn't all that simple.

400
00:15:17,133 --> 00:15:19,533
‐ Feast or famine?
‐ Hey, you're back.

401
00:15:19,566 --> 00:15:20,800
Yeah, another chopper
beat us to the punch.

402
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,433
‐ Is Susan around?
‐ Yeah.

403
00:15:24,533 --> 00:15:28,200
Okay, your screaming isn't
making our job any easier.

404
00:15:28,233 --> 00:15:30,500
‐ This is hard for him.
‐ Settle down, okay?

405
00:15:30,533 --> 00:15:32,433
It hurts like a son of a bitch!

406
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:35,200
It's going to continue to hurt
unless we pull your arm out.

407
00:15:35,233 --> 00:15:37,400
‐ Radial pulse is still strong.
‐ Oh, God, please help me!

408
00:15:37,433 --> 00:15:38,666
Maybe you should
just go ahead and give

409
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,700
him more
of Versed or fent.

410
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:41,300
Yes! Yes!

411
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:42,700
We already did,
he should be unconscious.

412
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,233
Then why is he
still screaming?

413
00:15:44,266 --> 00:15:46,366
‐ I don't know.
‐ His ribs are broken.

414
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,100
Yeah, that and he's
going through withdrawal.

415
00:15:48,133 --> 00:15:49,633
I can't take it, baby!

416
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,800
‐ Hey, Susan.
‐ What?

417
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:54,200
I gotta guy here who
says he's your husband.

418
00:15:54,233 --> 00:15:55,766
‐ What's he look like?
‐ 'A‐a‐ah!'

419
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,666
Uh‐h‐h, tall,
dark hair, flight nurse.

420
00:16:03,233 --> 00:16:04,333
Yeah, that's him.

421
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,233
You were in Las Vegas
for, like, two days.

422
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,500
And three nights.

423
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:19,200
We met on the plane
on the way over there.

424
00:16:19,233 --> 00:16:20,533
Hung out all weekend.

425
00:16:20,566 --> 00:16:22,633
Were you sober
at any point?

426
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,633
Sunday night,
we wanted burgers

427
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:27,266
so we took a cab
to this drive through.

428
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,366
Turns out to be...
a mini‐chapel.

429
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,366
Ah, so you figured, "What
the hell, let's get married."

430
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,400
I know, it was impulsive.

431
00:16:35,433 --> 00:16:37,433
Impulsive?

432
00:16:37,466 --> 00:16:39,266
Okay, it was really,
really stupid.

433
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,766
Susan..

434
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,600
I'm getting it
annulled anyway.

435
00:16:42,633 --> 00:16:45,433
I haven't seen him
since the wedding night.

436
00:16:45,466 --> 00:16:48,033
My flight left the next morning.
He stayed there for a week.

437
00:16:48,066 --> 00:16:49,566
He could have married
six other women by now.

438
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,366
Hey, do you remember
his name at least?

439
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,266
Uh, Chuck..

440
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,466
...Martin

441
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,500
I think.

442
00:16:56,533 --> 00:16:58,000
Good luck.

443
00:17:00,366 --> 00:17:02,733
Hey, stranger.

444
00:17:02,766 --> 00:17:04,333
Hey.

445
00:17:04,366 --> 00:17:06,266
Look, nifedipine
is contraindicated.

446
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,300
I'm not bottoming
out her pressure

447
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:08,633
and stroking this lady out.

448
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:10,333
Gallant, you are
preaching to the choir.

449
00:17:10,366 --> 00:17:12,133
He's the one that needs
to be educated about this.

450
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,033
Oh, and he wants to hear
that from a med student.

451
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:15,266
Look, obviously he needs‐‐

452
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,166
Blah, blah, blah.
Go talk to him.

453
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,133
If there's a problem
I'll take care of it.

454
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:23,033
‐ Got a lot of people scared.
‐ Not you.

455
00:17:23,066 --> 00:17:24,066
Still need to pay my rent.

456
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,400
Oh, come on, Romano's bark

457
00:17:25,433 --> 00:17:27,033
is so much worse
than his bite.

458
00:17:27,066 --> 00:17:29,400
Easy for you to say. You
can walk away if you want to.

459
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,100
So, Susan got married, huh?

460
00:17:32,133 --> 00:17:33,766
Can't call her indecisive.

461
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,200
Call her crazy.

462
00:17:35,233 --> 00:17:36,533
When are you people
going to do something?

463
00:17:37,733 --> 00:17:38,733
So I spoke
to an attorney.

464
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,466
Uh, yeah, me too.

465
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,666
He said annulling the marriage
should be fairly easy.

466
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,366
That's what my guy said.

467
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,266
I have to admit,
I was a little worried.

468
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,366
Why?

469
00:17:49,566 --> 00:17:51,500
Well...you know?

470
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,566
It was consummated.

471
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,633
Oh, yeah, right.

472
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,366
A few times,
as I remember.

473
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,533
More than a few times.

474
00:17:58,566 --> 00:18:01,100
‐ The cabana?
‐ Right, right.

475
00:18:01,133 --> 00:18:03,033
Right, but since we
never lived together

476
00:18:03,066 --> 00:18:05,466
I figured it
shouldn't be a problem.

477
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,566
Did you say
anything to anyone?

478
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,600
Like who? My mom?

479
00:18:07,633 --> 00:18:09,133
She'd kick my ass if she knew

480
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,166
I deprived her of a wedding.

481
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,600
Same with mine.

482
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:13,133
I kinda figured it wasn't
anyone's business, you know?

483
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,333
Exactly.

484
00:18:14,366 --> 00:18:16,100
And pretty tough
to explain too.

485
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:17,400
Please, who
are you telling?

486
00:18:17,433 --> 00:18:19,166
You kinda had to
have been there.

487
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,233
Yeah, made sense
at the time.

488
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:25,333
Guess you have to
get back to work.

489
00:18:25,366 --> 00:18:26,633
Yeah.

490
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:27,633
‐ So play hooky.
‐ Yeah.

491
00:18:29,366 --> 00:18:31,500
Morales buddy, you don't write,
you don't call.

492
00:18:31,533 --> 00:18:33,233
No time to radio.

493
00:18:33,266 --> 00:18:35,200
Twenty four‐year‐old female
passed out at Marshall Field's.

494
00:18:35,233 --> 00:18:36,333
No trauma, no seizure.

495
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:37,700
What? You were shopping?

496
00:18:37,733 --> 00:18:40,066
‐ We were registering.
‐ Debra's pregnant.

497
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,500
Don't tell me, you were
going to say that next.

498
00:18:41,533 --> 00:18:43,633
BP's 100/60.
Sats are good.

499
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,333
Do you remember
falling, Debra?

500
00:18:45,366 --> 00:18:47,633
I remember feeling weak.
But I haven't been eating.

501
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:51,300
Okay. Start a second line
and put up another liter.

502
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,600
‐ Morning sickness?
‐ Oh, bad.

503
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,066
My first wife had three kids.

504
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,200
She never even burped.

505
00:18:56,233 --> 00:18:58,500
Maybe I'm not cut out for this.

506
00:18:58,533 --> 00:19:00,433
‐ What have we got?
‐ Debra Strickland.

507
00:19:00,466 --> 00:19:02,233
Pregnant syncope, 18 weeks.

508
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,466
Hi, Debra.

509
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,433
‐ Any cramping or spotting?
‐ No.

510
00:19:05,466 --> 00:19:06,800
Okay, let's spin a crit,
check her glucose

511
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,400
and dip a urine to start.

512
00:19:08,433 --> 00:19:09,733
Ow!

513
00:19:09,766 --> 00:19:11,633
That hurts?

514
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:14,400
And my belly.
It never did before.

515
00:19:14,433 --> 00:19:17,466
‐ How about when I do this?
‐ Ow!

516
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,066
Abby, can you see if
Linda Woo is still here?

517
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,300
I can check.

518
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:21,733
Finally get
a surgical candidate?

519
00:19:21,766 --> 00:19:23,666
Oh, God, I‐I need an operation?

520
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,600
‐ 'Not necessarily.'
‐ Stripe in Morrison's.

521
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:28,433
Yup. And in
the paracolic gutter.

522
00:19:28,466 --> 00:19:30,133
'Probably blood judging
from her hypertension.'

523
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,566
Put the probe back
over the kidney.

524
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,100
It is.

525
00:19:33,133 --> 00:19:34,433
Doesn't look like it.

526
00:19:36,233 --> 00:19:37,566
It's not.

527
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,700
Surgery's here.

528
00:19:38,733 --> 00:19:39,800
What do you have for me?

529
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,200
Twenty four‐year‐old,
18 week

530
00:19:41,233 --> 00:19:42,633
IUP with hypertension

531
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,366
intraperitoneal fluid
and a renal mass.

532
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,666
Obvious ex‐lap for tissue
diagnosis and staging.

533
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,566
‐ Who are you?
‐ Dr. Robert Romano.

534
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,033
Head of surgery
less than a week ago.

535
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:54,100
‐ Who the hell are you?
‐ 'This is Dr. Woo.'

536
00:19:54,133 --> 00:19:56,333
She started yesterday.

537
00:19:56,366 --> 00:19:58,400
Ma'am, do you have any
medical problems or allergies?

538
00:19:58,433 --> 00:19:59,700
Are you deaf?

539
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,633
‐ Um, let me page Corday.
‐ I'll do it.

540
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:06,100
BP is dropping, 86/62.

541
00:20:06,133 --> 00:20:07,466
Any moron can see she needs

542
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,566
surgical intervention
for hemostasis. Take her up.

543
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,500
I'm sorry, what's
your position here?

544
00:20:12,533 --> 00:20:14,266
Your practical
and intellectual superior

545
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,233
with over 20 years
of surgical experience

546
00:20:16,266 --> 00:20:18,466
versus the two years of ass
wiping you call residency.

547
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,366
‐ Take her up.
‐ Done.

548
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:23,800
'He was diagnosed at birth.'

549
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,100
But access to any kind of care

550
00:20:25,133 --> 00:20:26,300
has been limited at best.

551
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:27,500
He's been revised?

552
00:20:27,533 --> 00:20:29,533
Twice.

553
00:20:29,566 --> 00:20:31,533
The last time,
five years ago

554
00:20:31,566 --> 00:20:34,033
and the surgical team that
performed it in Croatia

555
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,366
has disbanded since then.

556
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,233
And there's nothing
else in Europe?

557
00:20:37,266 --> 00:20:38,533
Nothing they
can afford.

558
00:20:38,566 --> 00:20:40,766
And County's pediatric
thoracic group

559
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,633
does unifocalization
all the time.

560
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,300
Free of charge.

561
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,666
Yes, but he's not a citizen.

562
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,733
Neither are we,
but we are here.

563
00:20:49,766 --> 00:20:51,600
Look, even if you
get a surgical team

564
00:20:51,633 --> 00:20:54,166
to donate services, who's going
to pick up the hospital tab?

565
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,733
With some PR, charitable
contributions could cover it.

566
00:20:56,766 --> 00:20:58,500
Yeah, but Kerry would still
have to sign off on it.

567
00:20:58,533 --> 00:21:00,066
Are you on good
terms with her?

568
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,666
‐ Uh, not really.
‐ Well, neither am I.

569
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,466
Look, leave it with me,
I'll see what I can do.

570
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,633
Thanks.

571
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:10,433
‐ Where's Dr. Woo?
‐ She...left.

572
00:21:10,466 --> 00:21:12,633
You need to teach your residents
to have thicker skin, Lizzie.

573
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,233
She only cried a little.

574
00:21:14,266 --> 00:21:16,300
‐ Pratt's consoling her.
‐ Oh, dear.

575
00:21:19,733 --> 00:21:21,233
Right.

576
00:21:23,466 --> 00:21:25,500
Intraperitoneal
fluid and a mass.

577
00:21:25,533 --> 00:21:27,400
And pregnant with
profound hypertension.

578
00:21:27,433 --> 00:21:28,666
My guess, renal cell CA.

579
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,600
Necrotic mass
obscuring and deforming

580
00:21:30,633 --> 00:21:32,066
the capsule of the left kidney.

581
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,233
Bleeding across
the peritoneum

582
00:21:33,266 --> 00:21:34,433
more like metastases.

583
00:21:34,466 --> 00:21:35,466
She'll definitely
need surgery.

584
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,800
Hello.

585
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,700
I'd like a CT of
the abdomen if I can

586
00:21:38,733 --> 00:21:41,200
and have OB involved as well.
She's stable enough now.

587
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:42,733
Yeah, sure, why don't
we get a third consult

588
00:21:42,766 --> 00:21:44,733
maybe, uh, ask
the janitor what he thinks.

589
00:21:44,766 --> 00:21:46,366
I'm down here less than
a day, already I'm starting

590
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,433
to hate surgeons.

591
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,300
Is something wrong
with the baby?

592
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:54,733
No. The baby's quite
healthy, actually.

593
00:21:54,766 --> 00:21:57,133
‐ Dr. Romano, you have a minute?
‐ Less than.

594
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,800
It's about my high blood
pressure patient this morning.

595
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:00,466
I should have, uh,
pointed it out to you

596
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,500
but the use of
sublingual nifedipine

597
00:22:02,533 --> 00:22:04,100
is no longer indicated
because of a number

598
00:22:04,133 --> 00:22:05,433
of case fatalities
from stroke.

599
00:22:05,466 --> 00:22:06,466
I never said nifedipine,

600
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,500
I set up her metoprolol.

601
00:22:07,533 --> 00:22:09,233
Works fine for hypertension.

602
00:22:09,266 --> 00:22:11,166
No, actually you said
nifedipine and you said‐‐

603
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,266
Okay‐okay‐okay,
listen, okay, goofus.

604
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,566
‐ I'm the doctor, you are not.
‐ You know what?

605
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,100
It seems to me that
it is your intention‐‐

606
00:22:16,133 --> 00:22:18,133
My intention is to

607
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:19,633
serve out my time in this
hell hole without having

608
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:21,433
affirmative action
imbeciles like you

609
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:23,033
make me regret ever
having gone into medicine.

610
00:22:23,066 --> 00:22:24,400
Your minute's up.

611
00:22:24,433 --> 00:22:26,066
Hey, where are my bullet points?

612
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,400
Uh, right.

613
00:22:27,433 --> 00:22:29,400
Well, obviously you can't
fire medical students

614
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:31,200
but failing them is a bad
idea because then they

615
00:22:31,233 --> 00:22:32,733
just have to
repeat the rotation.

616
00:22:32,766 --> 00:22:35,166
‐ I'd suggest a marginal pass.
‐ Alright, what else?

617
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,333
You can, however,
fire care partners.

618
00:22:37,366 --> 00:22:38,600
What the hell's
a care partner?

619
00:22:38,633 --> 00:22:42,200
It's like, uh,
non‐union orderly.

620
00:22:42,233 --> 00:22:44,100
Hey, you.
What's your name?

621
00:22:44,133 --> 00:22:45,733
‐ Jim.
‐ Yeah, you pay union dues, Jim?

622
00:22:45,766 --> 00:22:47,433
‐ No.
‐ Good. You're fired.

623
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:50,166
‐ I need something!
‐ That is putting me on edge.

624
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,066
Yeah, well, it was a lot worse
when his girlfriend was here.

625
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,166
Tell Lewis to gag him,
sedate him, or kill him.

626
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,600
‐ She's on break.
‐ What?

627
00:22:55,633 --> 00:22:57,266
Is there some prerequisite
for working here?

628
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,533
You have to be
a know‐nothing drag‐ass

629
00:22:58,566 --> 00:23:00,266
who doesn't wear a watch?

630
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,166
I always suspected Weaver
would kill her own mother

631
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,133
to get out of this dung
heap and now I know why.

632
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:06,366
Because, apparently, only
the chief of emergency medicine

633
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,133
is concerned with
clearing the board!

634
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:10,400
‐ You gotta help me.
‐ Hands off, lowlife!

635
00:23:10,433 --> 00:23:12,333
Alright, you, where
are your parents?

636
00:23:12,366 --> 00:23:13,700
I don't have any.

637
00:23:13,733 --> 00:23:16,800
They died in a car
crash last year.

638
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:18,066
Bummer! So,
what's your problem?

639
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,100
I need it bad, man.

640
00:23:19,133 --> 00:23:20,533
I need something really bad.

641
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,466
Hey, Chuny, can you
move him to Exam Four?

642
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,333
My pleasure. Come on.

643
00:23:24,366 --> 00:23:27,200
Wait. Just one more paragraph
in the lab tech union manual.

644
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,466
Can you make sure that I
see all of Romano's patients

645
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,700
before anyone gets
dispo'd today?

646
00:23:32,733 --> 00:23:33,766
Sure.

647
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,666
‐ Thank you.
‐ Thank you.

648
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,266
Doesn't mean you don't
have to work with him.

649
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,766
Okay, where were we?

650
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,466
Um, I reached
for the soap

651
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,666
down I went, landed
right on my...rump.

652
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,566
Well, that's not good.

653
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,166
Any loss of consciousness?

654
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,633
No, just loss
of dignity.

655
00:23:49,666 --> 00:23:52,566
I know, I know,
I'm late, I'm late.

656
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,633
I had to move Nicky.
He was driving everybody crazy.

657
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,133
Oh, sorry,
thank you.

658
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:58,433
And I sent up labs on
your hyperemesis patient

659
00:23:58,466 --> 00:24:00,466
dispo'd your
no‐longer‐itchy rash guy.

660
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,800
‐ Yikes, was I gone that long?
‐ I'll tell you what.

661
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:03,333
If you take Sandra here,
we'll call it even.

662
00:24:03,366 --> 00:24:04,733
I got to go check
on a patient up in CT.

663
00:24:04,766 --> 00:24:05,766
Done.

664
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,233
Slip‐and‐fall in the shower

665
00:24:07,266 --> 00:24:09,200
possible wrist fracture.

666
00:24:09,233 --> 00:24:10,466
Congratulations.

667
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,700
On what?

668
00:24:11,733 --> 00:24:13,266
Your newlywed status.

669
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,266
‐ Ooh, lucky.
‐ Excuse me.

670
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,566
Oh, I've probably been
looking for Mr. Right

671
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,433
ten years longer than you
and still haven't found him.

672
00:24:19,466 --> 00:24:23,066
Last time it happened,
they kept me here.

673
00:24:29,266 --> 00:24:30,300
You done?

674
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:31,733
I think so.

675
00:24:31,766 --> 00:24:33,033
What happened
to your arm?

676
00:24:33,066 --> 00:24:34,200
Are you physically incapable

677
00:24:34,233 --> 00:24:35,600
of keeping your mouth shut?

678
00:24:35,633 --> 00:24:37,466
I mean, were you born
that way or something?

679
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,533
None of your beeswax.

680
00:24:38,566 --> 00:24:40,200
Breathe deep.

681
00:24:40,233 --> 00:24:42,233
Hey! What do you
do for soft asthma?

682
00:24:42,266 --> 00:24:44,366
A couple of nebs
and some prednisone?

683
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,300
You're asking a nurse?

684
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:47,666
Yeah, what you said

685
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,766
only I take
an adult dose now.

686
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,800
What he said I said.

687
00:24:50,833 --> 00:24:52,166
Then discharge with follow‐up.

688
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,733
Okay. That took
all of eight minutes.

689
00:24:54,766 --> 00:24:57,033
See people,
it can be done!

690
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,333
What can be done?

691
00:24:59,366 --> 00:25:00,700
Oh, BS‐ing your way

692
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:02,600
through a shift, I suppose.

693
00:25:02,633 --> 00:25:05,500
Hey, listen, I didn't
mean to be nosy before.

694
00:25:05,533 --> 00:25:07,133
Just making little talk.

695
00:25:08,766 --> 00:25:10,633
‐ Small talk.
‐ Dr. Kovac.

696
00:25:10,666 --> 00:25:13,366
Your exposure guy is coming to.

697
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,700
‐ Any word on Rushing's wife?
‐ No.

698
00:25:14,733 --> 00:25:16,633
They're still trying
to get ahold of her.

699
00:25:16,666 --> 00:25:18,300
Mr. Rushing?

700
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:20,333
Mr. Rushing, can
you understand me?

701
00:25:20,366 --> 00:25:21,400
Yeah.

702
00:25:21,433 --> 00:25:24,033
Do you know what
happened to you?

703
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:25,233
Car..

704
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,600
...crashed.

705
00:25:27,633 --> 00:25:28,633
Your car?

706
00:25:31,466 --> 00:25:32,700
Where are they?

707
00:25:32,733 --> 00:25:34,700
Who?

708
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:36,200
My kids.

709
00:25:37,566 --> 00:25:40,266
We were driving..

710
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,333
...walked to get help.

711
00:25:41,366 --> 00:25:42,600
Oh, my God.

712
00:25:42,633 --> 00:25:44,100
Go get the police.

713
00:25:44,133 --> 00:25:46,133
His kids are still
out there somewhere.

714
00:25:51,233 --> 00:25:52,800
So, how long have
you been married?

715
00:25:52,833 --> 00:25:54,666
Um, two years.

716
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,733
Some people think the age
difference is a problem

717
00:25:56,766 --> 00:25:58,766
but I can't
keep up with him.

718
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,600
We're going to
minimize the exposure

719
00:26:00,633 --> 00:26:04,233
to...protect the baby.

720
00:26:04,266 --> 00:26:06,566
"Our little accident"
Bill likes to call him.

721
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,666
'Oh, you're having a boy?'

722
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,800
Uh, just a guess.

723
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:10,033
Will you be
able to tell?

724
00:26:10,066 --> 00:26:11,233
No, not with this.

725
00:26:11,266 --> 00:26:13,566
Oh, good. I wanna be surprised.

726
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,133
'Okay, you have
to lay very still'

727
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:17,200
and there's an intercom
in case you want to talk.

728
00:26:23,533 --> 00:26:25,633
'Uh, CT abdo‐pelvis with..'

729
00:26:26,433 --> 00:26:27,733
...and without.

730
00:26:27,766 --> 00:26:31,033
Fine cuts right
through the kidney.

731
00:26:31,066 --> 00:26:33,433
Debra, when we shoot the rest
of the dye in, you may continue

732
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:35,633
to feel kind of a warm
tingling sensation.

733
00:26:35,666 --> 00:26:37,266
Uh‐uh, okay.

734
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:40,733
'There it is.'

735
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:43,533
Smaller masses in
the abdominal cavity too.

736
00:26:43,566 --> 00:26:46,366
Hey, I'm just the tech.

737
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,733
'Hematoma and fluid from
where the main tumor bled.'

738
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,566
She's gonna need a nephrectomy.

739
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,766
'Yeah, like now.'

740
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,100
I guess Romano was right
about one thing today.

741
00:26:58,133 --> 00:27:00,100
'Is it almost over?'

742
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:09,185
What are their names?

743
00:27:09,218 --> 00:27:11,818
'S...Sally..'

744
00:27:13,685 --> 00:27:15,185
...and Tim.

745
00:27:15,218 --> 00:27:17,251
Do you know how
badly they were hurt?

746
00:27:19,851 --> 00:27:20,885
It was dark.

747
00:27:23,618 --> 00:27:26,018
I just remember crying.

748
00:27:26,051 --> 00:27:28,051
BP's stable. 128/80.

749
00:27:28,085 --> 00:27:29,851
Pulse is 106.

750
00:27:29,885 --> 00:27:31,685
They were so scared.

751
00:27:34,985 --> 00:27:35,985
'Luka..'

752
00:27:36,018 --> 00:27:37,151
Uh, another liter

753
00:27:37,185 --> 00:27:38,751
of warm saline.

754
00:27:38,785 --> 00:27:41,085
Do you recall
where it happened?

755
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:42,118
Do you recall
when it happened?

756
00:27:42,151 --> 00:27:43,151
No.

757
00:27:44,818 --> 00:27:46,951
They're dead, aren't they?

758
00:27:46,985 --> 00:27:48,951
'We're trying to find them.'

759
00:27:48,985 --> 00:27:50,751
I'm going to start
calling some of this in.

760
00:27:50,785 --> 00:27:52,251
Okay, this guy's
approaching the six‐hour mark.

761
00:27:52,285 --> 00:27:54,218
‐ Is he stable?
‐ Just finishing up a Heimlich.

762
00:27:54,251 --> 00:27:57,518
Which is the cheesy ER way
of dealing with a pneumothorax.

763
00:27:57,551 --> 00:27:58,885
I did it so he could stay here

764
00:27:58,918 --> 00:28:00,251
in case his
family's found.

765
00:28:00,285 --> 00:28:01,751
So turf him to medicine.

766
00:28:01,785 --> 00:28:03,185
Let them hold hands
and sing "Kumbaya" there.

767
00:28:03,218 --> 00:28:04,718
His kids could
be seriously hurt.

768
00:28:04,751 --> 00:28:05,951
Yeah, that's right.
But he's not.

769
00:28:05,985 --> 00:28:07,218
So get him the hell
out of my trauma room.

770
00:28:07,251 --> 00:28:08,518
‐ Look‐‐
‐ What, what, what?

771
00:28:08,551 --> 00:28:09,885
Is this mandatory therapy crap

772
00:28:09,918 --> 00:28:11,251
making you a little soft, Kovac?

773
00:28:11,285 --> 00:28:13,685
Do us both a favor.
Stop seeing your shrink.

774
00:28:13,718 --> 00:28:14,951
I mean, I don't believe
in it, and frankly

775
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:16,651
if you're that screwed up, quit.

776
00:28:18,051 --> 00:28:19,118
Where the hell have you been?

777
00:28:19,151 --> 00:28:20,251
Back to work.

778
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:24,518
‐ Hey, welcome back.
‐ Right.

779
00:28:24,551 --> 00:28:26,951
X‐ray's backed up and she's
complaining of a headache.

780
00:28:26,985 --> 00:28:28,085
Alright, let's get her
to curtain area three

781
00:28:28,118 --> 00:28:29,518
and give her some Tylenol.

782
00:28:29,551 --> 00:28:30,751
You could probably
use a lunch tray by now.

783
00:28:30,785 --> 00:28:32,151
What I could
use is a husband.

784
00:28:32,185 --> 00:28:33,785
Does yours
have a brother?

785
00:28:47,685 --> 00:28:49,218
Oh, no. Damn!

786
00:28:59,951 --> 00:29:02,151
Hey, Kippy, my man!
What's happening?

787
00:29:02,185 --> 00:29:04,685
Foot still hurts like hell!
I should sue you clowns!

788
00:29:04,718 --> 00:29:06,018
Yeah, yeah, yeah, listen,
look, I'm in a rush, man.

789
00:29:06,051 --> 00:29:07,718
What you got
for the ladies?

790
00:29:07,751 --> 00:29:08,985
‐ Stuffed animals.
‐ No, man.

791
00:29:09,018 --> 00:29:11,185
I need something
that a lady can wear.

792
00:29:11,218 --> 00:29:12,518
Uh‐h‐h

793
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:14,585
got some handmade jewelry

794
00:29:14,618 --> 00:29:17,185
some perfume...tie‐dyed T‐shirt!

795
00:29:17,218 --> 00:29:18,885
‐ Uh‐uh.
‐ 'Wait.'

796
00:29:18,918 --> 00:29:20,651
We got some new items in.

797
00:29:31,951 --> 00:29:33,751
How much?

798
00:29:33,785 --> 00:29:34,818
What's this doing here?

799
00:29:34,851 --> 00:29:35,985
Uh, we always have cake

800
00:29:36,018 --> 00:29:37,585
when it's someone's birthday.

801
00:29:37,618 --> 00:29:38,851
Woman pops a kid out,
what the hell difference

802
00:29:38,885 --> 00:29:40,118
does it make what day it is?

803
00:29:40,151 --> 00:29:41,785
No more official
or unofficial recognition

804
00:29:41,818 --> 00:29:42,818
of birthdays.

805
00:29:42,851 --> 00:29:44,818
Oh, you can't be serious.

806
00:29:44,851 --> 00:29:46,585
Singing, blowing
out candles, eating.

807
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,985
By the time
it's all said and done

808
00:29:48,018 --> 00:29:49,618
everybody's had
a half‐hour break with pay.

809
00:29:49,651 --> 00:29:50,885
It fosters community.

810
00:29:50,918 --> 00:29:52,285
Yeah, and lethargy
by the looks of things.

811
00:29:52,318 --> 00:29:54,251
‐ Sandra Haycox.
‐ What about her?

812
00:29:54,285 --> 00:29:56,651
She has a broken wrist.
Cast her and cast her off.

813
00:29:56,685 --> 00:29:57,885
She's complaining
of a headache now.

814
00:29:57,918 --> 00:29:59,551
Uh‐uh, tell her to take

815
00:29:59,585 --> 00:30:00,618
a number and get back in line.

816
00:30:00,651 --> 00:30:02,085
One complaint per visit.

817
00:30:02,118 --> 00:30:04,151
Hey, who ate my cake?

818
00:30:05,551 --> 00:30:07,218
‐ Nana, Nana!
‐ What happened?

819
00:30:07,251 --> 00:30:09,585
Eight‐year‐old front‐seat
passenger in single‐car MVA.

820
00:30:09,618 --> 00:30:11,151
Seat belt, shoulder harness.
Air bag deployed.

821
00:30:11,185 --> 00:30:12,751
Pretty hard
from the looks of it.

822
00:30:12,785 --> 00:30:14,885
Facial abrasions.
May have a ruptured globe.

823
00:30:14,918 --> 00:30:16,018
Why was she sitting
in the front seat?

824
00:30:16,051 --> 00:30:17,585
Ask grandma.

825
00:30:17,618 --> 00:30:19,685
The tumor outgrew
it's blood supply

826
00:30:19,718 --> 00:30:21,651
then part of it died,
ruptured and bled.

827
00:30:21,685 --> 00:30:23,018
That's why
you passed out.

828
00:30:23,051 --> 00:30:24,818
It could rupture
again at any moment

829
00:30:24,851 --> 00:30:26,551
so it's important
that we remove it

830
00:30:26,585 --> 00:30:29,751
and the kidney
as soon as possible.

831
00:30:29,785 --> 00:30:32,018
Well, what kind
of a tumor is it?

832
00:30:32,051 --> 00:30:33,185
We don't know.

833
00:30:33,218 --> 00:30:34,518
And we won't know until we get

834
00:30:34,551 --> 00:30:36,818
a pathology report.

835
00:30:36,851 --> 00:30:39,118
Do you think it's cancer?

836
00:30:39,151 --> 00:30:41,518
Let's take this
one step at a time.

837
00:30:41,551 --> 00:30:44,285
My mother died of cancer.

838
00:30:44,318 --> 00:30:46,085
If that's what this is,
I should know.

839
00:30:46,118 --> 00:30:49,085
‐ Debra.
‐ I should know.

840
00:30:49,118 --> 00:30:53,285
It appears likely to be
renal cell carcinoma, yes.

841
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:56,551
'And if it's as
aggressive as it seems'

842
00:30:56,585 --> 00:30:58,551
it's possible that
you would require chemo

843
00:30:58,585 --> 00:31:02,151
and radiation therapy
following surgery.

844
00:31:02,185 --> 00:31:06,551
Unfortunately chemotherapy
is unadvisable while pregnant.

845
00:31:08,918 --> 00:31:11,285
You said it was aggressive.

846
00:31:11,318 --> 00:31:13,518
‐ Yes, but..
‐ Take it out.

847
00:31:14,985 --> 00:31:17,285
Take everything.

848
00:31:17,318 --> 00:31:19,685
Are you saying you wish
to terminate as well?

849
00:31:23,118 --> 00:31:27,018
Just...just do it all at once.

850
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:30,185
Typically, those procedures
would be done separately.

851
00:31:30,218 --> 00:31:31,751
'If you had the surgery
and then waited'

852
00:31:31,785 --> 00:31:32,851
until after
the baby was born‐‐

853
00:31:32,885 --> 00:31:35,918
I want the chemo!

854
00:31:35,951 --> 00:31:38,051
‐ 'Honey!'
‐ I want it now.

855
00:31:40,885 --> 00:31:43,251
We're going to leave
you alone to talk.

856
00:31:45,951 --> 00:31:47,618
I guess she figures
she can try again

857
00:31:47,651 --> 00:31:48,785
if she beats the cancer.

858
00:31:48,818 --> 00:31:50,018
In three weeks' time

859
00:31:50,051 --> 00:31:51,551
the fetus might be
viable outside the womb.

860
00:31:51,585 --> 00:31:52,918
She could fight it then.

861
00:31:52,951 --> 00:31:54,051
She doesn't want
to take that chance.

862
00:31:54,085 --> 00:31:55,151
She's young.

863
00:31:55,185 --> 00:31:57,851
‐ She's scared.
‐ Yeah.

00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:26,985
What a difference
height makes, huh?

876
00:32:27,018 --> 00:32:29,518
Why would anyone put
their kid in the front seat?

877
00:32:29,551 --> 00:32:33,518
She begged me to.
She's my only grandchild.

878
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:35,985
'I just wanted
to make her happy.'

879
00:32:36,018 --> 00:32:37,718
Could you grab
a couple of Morgan Lenses

880
00:32:37,751 --> 00:32:38,885
from the eye
exam room?

881
00:32:38,918 --> 00:32:40,618
Yeah, sure.

882
00:32:40,651 --> 00:32:41,785
Okay, this
isn't going down

883
00:32:41,818 --> 00:32:42,885
as one of my
better days.

884
00:32:42,918 --> 00:32:45,185
That applies
to all of us.

885
00:32:45,218 --> 00:32:46,651
Wait a minute.

886
00:32:46,685 --> 00:32:48,618
Why is it quiet
all of a sudden?

887
00:32:57,151 --> 00:32:58,518
Unbelievable!

888
00:32:58,551 --> 00:32:59,918
It was too hard to watch.

889
00:32:59,951 --> 00:33:01,518
So you went out and scored?

890
00:33:01,551 --> 00:33:02,785
You weren't doing anything.

891
00:33:02,818 --> 00:33:03,818
'I had to.'

892
00:33:03,851 --> 00:33:06,118
You want Narcan?

893
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,585
Put him
on a monitor.

894
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:09,085
At least
someone's happy.

895
00:33:10,218 --> 00:33:13,018
Of course, it would be pro bono.

896
00:33:13,051 --> 00:33:14,651
Have you looked
at our budget lately?

897
00:33:14,685 --> 00:33:15,951
Every time we open our doors

898
00:33:15,985 --> 00:33:17,251
we're working pro bono.

899
00:33:17,285 --> 00:33:19,151
We're in a deep
deficit, Elizabeth.

900
00:33:19,185 --> 00:33:21,118
I could contact
local cardiac surgeons

901
00:33:21,151 --> 00:33:23,118
and specialists, ask them
to donate their services.

902
00:33:23,151 --> 00:33:25,118
Which would account
for about 25%

903
00:33:25,151 --> 00:33:27,985
of the total costs,
and forget about Medicaid.

904
00:33:28,018 --> 00:33:29,651
The boy's not
even a US citizen.

905
00:33:29,685 --> 00:33:30,818
Well, that might
be something

906
00:33:30,851 --> 00:33:32,051
that would
interest the media.

907
00:33:32,085 --> 00:33:33,551
I mean, look at
the‐the separation

908
00:33:33,585 --> 00:33:35,018
of the Guatemalan
conjoined twins.

909
00:33:35,051 --> 00:33:36,218
Well, somehow,
I don't think

910
00:33:36,251 --> 00:33:38,518
a Croatian kid
needing a tet repair

911
00:33:38,551 --> 00:33:41,618
is gonna get the same draw.

912
00:33:41,651 --> 00:33:44,818
Kerry, he's nine years old.
He'll die without it.

913
00:33:44,851 --> 00:33:47,918
And we're just not able
to help right now. I'm sorry.

914
00:33:53,318 --> 00:33:55,551
Kerry, can I ask you something?

915
00:33:55,585 --> 00:33:58,151
Are you as concerned
about Robert as I am?

916
00:33:58,185 --> 00:34:00,685
Uh, more precisely..

917
00:34:00,718 --> 00:34:01,918
...his mental health.

918
00:34:01,951 --> 00:34:04,585
He seems..

919
00:34:04,618 --> 00:34:06,151
...broken by this assignment.

920
00:34:06,185 --> 00:34:08,518
He's a cockroach.

921
00:34:08,551 --> 00:34:11,151
He'll refuse to evolve,
and yet survive us all.

922
00:34:16,051 --> 00:34:17,651
Talk to me
about residents.

923
00:34:17,685 --> 00:34:19,051
Well, you need
beaucoup documentation

924
00:34:19,085 --> 00:34:20,651
but you have a more
powerful weapon

925
00:34:20,685 --> 00:34:21,751
in scheduling.

926
00:34:21,785 --> 00:34:22,785
As long as
they don't pull

927
00:34:22,818 --> 00:34:24,185
more than 16 shifts a month

928
00:34:24,218 --> 00:34:26,185
or work more than
three nights in a row

929
00:34:26,218 --> 00:34:28,551
you can book them
for every weekend

930
00:34:28,585 --> 00:34:29,785
holiday, or playoff
night you want.

931
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:31,251
‐ That's good stuff.
‐ Thank you.

932
00:34:31,285 --> 00:34:33,218
How come the delinquent
hasn't been dispo'd yet?

933
00:34:33,251 --> 00:34:36,151
Uh...that wasn't on
my list of things to do.

934
00:34:36,185 --> 00:34:37,618
You didn't give Eddie
enough prednisone

935
00:34:37,651 --> 00:34:39,751
with his albuterol.

936
00:34:39,785 --> 00:34:40,985
Let me get something straight.

937
00:34:41,018 --> 00:34:43,585
‐ You overrode my orders?
‐ Yeah.

938
00:34:43,618 --> 00:34:45,051
Before he can leave,
he needs to be able to walk

939
00:34:45,085 --> 00:34:47,518
and hold normal sats,
which he can't do.

940
00:34:47,551 --> 00:34:50,051
‐ Uh‐oh, you screwed up.
‐ No, I did not.

941
00:34:50,085 --> 00:34:51,251
Maybe you haven't
been listening.

942
00:34:51,285 --> 00:34:52,818
Look there's
a lot of basic‐‐

943
00:34:52,851 --> 00:34:54,551
Because I believe
I've made myself clear.

944
00:34:54,585 --> 00:34:55,618
And there's
a lot of people‐‐

945
00:34:55,651 --> 00:34:56,651
You don't
question my judgment.

946
00:34:56,685 --> 00:34:57,718
You do not override my orders

947
00:34:57,751 --> 00:34:58,985
and you sure as hell

948
00:34:59,018 --> 00:35:01,251
don't get too comfortable
here, Dr. Carter!

949
00:35:02,585 --> 00:35:04,751
This is my ER now!

950
00:35:04,785 --> 00:35:05,951
It stays for one thing!

951
00:35:05,985 --> 00:35:08,918
Everyone's replaceable!

952
00:35:08,951 --> 00:35:10,151
Even you.

953
00:35:19,185 --> 00:35:20,918
I just need to know what
to tell the guy. Alright.

954
00:35:20,951 --> 00:35:23,185
‐ That better be a local call.
‐ It's a police matter.

955
00:35:23,218 --> 00:35:24,851
They haven't
found the car yet?

956
00:35:24,885 --> 00:35:26,585
Hey, we checked every
road, bridge and river

957
00:35:26,618 --> 00:35:27,685
within five miles
of where we found him.

958
00:35:27,718 --> 00:35:28,885
Why not ten or fifteen?

959
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:29,918
There's no way
he could've walked

960
00:35:29,951 --> 00:35:31,218
that far with those injuries.

961
00:35:31,251 --> 00:35:32,785
He was getting help
for his children.

962
00:35:32,818 --> 00:35:34,985
‐ He could've walked 100 miles.
‐ What can I say?

963
00:35:35,018 --> 00:35:36,218
We're already covering
a lot of territory.

964
00:35:36,251 --> 00:35:37,718
With search teams,
with dogs?

965
00:35:37,751 --> 00:35:38,885
It's 40 degrees
out there.

966
00:35:38,918 --> 00:35:40,618
Look, we're
doing all we can.

967
00:35:40,651 --> 00:35:42,185
Luka, where's Dr. Romano?

968
00:35:42,218 --> 00:35:44,185
I don't know
and I don't care.

969
00:35:44,218 --> 00:35:46,585
‐ Hey, Chuny, how's it going?
‐ Don't even.

970
00:35:47,985 --> 00:35:50,185
‐ John.
‐ 'Thought you were long gone.'

971
00:35:50,218 --> 00:35:52,151
Yeah, I just wanted to check

972
00:35:52,185 --> 00:35:54,951
and see how Robert
was doing.

973
00:35:54,985 --> 00:35:58,018
As expected.
He was abysmal.

974
00:35:58,051 --> 00:35:59,185
He has no patient rapport

975
00:35:59,218 --> 00:36:01,185
severely stunted
interpersonal skills

976
00:36:01,218 --> 00:36:02,585
and he's incredibly
hostile.

977
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:04,285
Qualities consistent
with most surgeons‐‐

978
00:36:04,318 --> 00:36:05,851
Kerry, the guy doesn't
know what he's doing

979
00:36:05,885 --> 00:36:06,985
and he doesn't wanna learn.

980
00:36:07,018 --> 00:36:08,651
And he almost killed
a patient today

981
00:36:08,685 --> 00:36:10,285
by prescribing
an antiquated treatment.

982
00:36:10,318 --> 00:36:12,751
But obviously, you stopped
him from doing so.

983
00:36:12,785 --> 00:36:14,885
Yeah, but I can't stay
on top of the guy 24/7.

984
00:36:14,918 --> 00:36:16,951
Yeah, we're trying to shift him
to a more administrative role.

985
00:36:16,985 --> 00:36:18,685
What are you gonna do,
chain him to his desk?

986
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,851
Look, the ER may not be
the best fit for Dr. Romano

987
00:36:20,885 --> 00:36:22,151
but it's all the man has.

988
00:36:22,185 --> 00:36:23,718
Just make it work

989
00:36:23,751 --> 00:36:25,518
or‐or better yet,
work around him.

990
00:36:25,551 --> 00:36:26,751
Okay.

991
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:28,518
Excuse me. I'm Diana Rushing.

992
00:36:28,551 --> 00:36:30,185
I got a message saying
my husband was brought here.

993
00:36:30,218 --> 00:36:32,118
Yeah, Dr. Kovac.
He treated your husband.

994
00:36:32,151 --> 00:36:35,051
‐ What is it?
‐ It's Rushing's wife.

995
00:36:35,085 --> 00:36:36,718
‐ I'll take you to him.
‐ Is he okay?

996
00:36:36,751 --> 00:36:37,951
I've been worried sick
the whole drive over here.

997
00:36:37,985 --> 00:36:39,618
I'm from Indiana.

998
00:36:39,651 --> 00:36:42,818
He's stable,
but he's obviously very upset.

999
00:36:42,851 --> 00:36:44,218
When did you see them last?

1000
00:36:44,251 --> 00:36:46,518
Josh left home four
days ago. Who's "them?"

1001
00:36:46,551 --> 00:36:48,185
Your husband and your children.

1002
00:36:48,218 --> 00:36:51,218
What children?

1003
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:53,551
He said he was with them
in a car when he crashed.

1004
00:36:55,018 --> 00:36:56,685
We don't have children.

1005
00:36:58,085 --> 00:36:59,851
Her caretaker says
she's been complaining

1006
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:00,985
of white discharge.

1007
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:02,118
She have her period yet?

1008
00:37:02,151 --> 00:37:04,051
Says she's a real woman.

1009
00:37:04,085 --> 00:37:05,751
Mindy, hi, I'm Dr. Lewis.

1010
00:37:05,785 --> 00:37:07,951
‐ How are you feeling?
‐ Good.

1011
00:37:07,985 --> 00:37:10,151
We're gonna do a test
on your private parts, okay?

1012
00:37:10,185 --> 00:37:11,685
Set up for a pelvic.

1013
00:37:11,718 --> 00:37:13,018
It's probably a simple
yeast infection.

1014
00:37:13,051 --> 00:37:14,751
Sandra? How's your headache.

1015
00:37:14,785 --> 00:37:16,585
Did the acetaminophen help?

1016
00:37:16,618 --> 00:37:19,218
Sandra...Sandra?

1017
00:37:19,251 --> 00:37:22,118
I need a crash cart.

1018
00:37:22,151 --> 00:37:23,918
I thought she came
in with a broken wrist.

1019
00:37:23,951 --> 00:37:25,551
‐ 'She did.'
‐ What happened?

1020
00:37:25,585 --> 00:37:27,951
I don't know.
Pulseless and apneic.

1021
00:37:29,885 --> 00:37:31,818
V‐fib. Charging to 200.

1022
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:34,985
And clear.

1023
00:37:38,718 --> 00:37:40,118
Unit number six, going up.

1024
00:37:40,151 --> 00:37:42,551
Tumor mass has invaded
the renal artery wall

1025
00:37:42,585 --> 00:37:43,918
and sections of the vena cava.

1026
00:37:43,951 --> 00:37:45,618
You want me
to call again?

1027
00:37:45,651 --> 00:37:47,151
They won't tell me anything
I don't already know.

1028
00:37:47,185 --> 00:37:49,051
It's stage 4B by the size
and the spread of it.

1029
00:37:49,085 --> 00:37:50,651
Let's take the kidney out.

1030
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,085
'Dr. Corday, call on line one.'

1031
00:37:52,118 --> 00:37:54,618
If it's path,
put it on speaker.

1032
00:37:54,651 --> 00:37:56,818
Pedicle clamp in place.

1033
00:37:56,851 --> 00:37:58,085
Metz to divide the vessels.

1034
00:37:58,118 --> 00:38:00,051
‐ 'Dr. Corday?'
‐ Yes, Dr. Meechum.

1035
00:38:00,085 --> 00:38:01,285
What are your findings?

1036
00:38:01,318 --> 00:38:02,618
'Furhman Grad Four'

1037
00:38:02,651 --> 00:38:03,951
'with sarcomatoid pattern'

1038
00:38:03,985 --> 00:38:05,751
'and a high mitotic picture.'

1039
00:38:05,785 --> 00:38:08,551
‐ 'Sorry.'
‐ Thank you.

1040
00:38:08,585 --> 00:38:11,785
‐ Done. Steel bowl.
‐ That's bad, I take it.

1041
00:38:11,818 --> 00:38:15,551
Irresectable. We'd be doing her
a favor if she bled to death.

1042
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:18,685
Her chance of survival
is less than 2% at this point.

1043
00:38:18,718 --> 00:38:21,018
Get her husband up here.
I want to speak to him now.

1044
00:38:21,051 --> 00:38:22,918
Charge again to 360 and clear.

1045
00:38:25,218 --> 00:38:27,151
Asystole.

1046
00:38:27,185 --> 00:38:28,718
It's been 20 minutes.

1047
00:38:28,751 --> 00:38:31,118
Uh, try another amp of epi.

1048
00:38:31,151 --> 00:38:32,618
'And...clear.'

1049
00:38:35,285 --> 00:38:37,518
'No pressure, no pulse.'

1050
00:38:37,551 --> 00:38:39,551
'A headache, a fall,
a blown pupil.'

1051
00:38:39,585 --> 00:38:41,218
Possibly jogged an aneurysm
she already had.

1052
00:38:43,085 --> 00:38:45,518
'No way you could've
known about it.'

1053
00:38:45,551 --> 00:38:47,751
'No way she could've
known about it.'

1054
00:38:47,785 --> 00:38:49,718
Yeah, I'm sure she wasn't
planning on dying today.

1055
00:38:51,718 --> 00:38:52,851
18:27.

1056
00:38:54,151 --> 00:38:55,885
Well, he's depressed.

1057
00:38:55,918 --> 00:38:58,651
That combined with aspects
of dissociative disorder

1058
00:38:58,685 --> 00:39:01,785
allowed him to create
this weird, negative amnesia.

1059
00:39:01,818 --> 00:39:04,551
‐ Was it a psychotic break?
‐ Mm, not per se.

1060
00:39:04,585 --> 00:39:08,251
But he definitely needs
in‐patient psych care.

1061
00:39:08,285 --> 00:39:09,585
When he talked about them

1062
00:39:09,618 --> 00:39:11,818
he made them sound so real.

1063
00:39:11,851 --> 00:39:14,085
Hm, to him they are.
Right now, anyway.

1064
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:15,785
But they won't always be.

1065
00:39:15,818 --> 00:39:17,985
With the right meds,
it'll all fade away.

1066
00:39:19,785 --> 00:39:22,051
Ow!

1067
00:39:22,085 --> 00:39:24,885
Cervical motion
tenderness.

1068
00:39:24,918 --> 00:39:26,085
PID?

1069
00:39:26,118 --> 00:39:27,585
Yup.

1070
00:39:27,618 --> 00:39:30,551
Mindy, do you have
a boyfriend?

1071
00:39:30,585 --> 00:39:32,985
Uh‐huh.

1072
00:39:33,018 --> 00:39:35,085
You're pretty young
to be having sex

1073
00:39:35,118 --> 00:39:36,818
much less
unprotected sex.

1074
00:39:36,851 --> 00:39:39,251
You need to tell
him to use condoms.

1075
00:39:39,285 --> 00:39:40,851
What are those?

1076
00:39:42,751 --> 00:39:45,218
That's not a good sign.

1077
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:47,718
Can you tell me his name?

1078
00:39:47,751 --> 00:39:50,085
'So we can make sure
he gets checked?'

1079
00:39:50,118 --> 00:39:52,085
He‐he cleans floors.

1080
00:39:53,618 --> 00:39:55,551
He says he loves me.

1081
00:39:57,218 --> 00:40:00,951
400 of cefixime
and a gram of azithro.

1082
00:40:00,985 --> 00:40:02,818
We're just gonna help
you get dressed, okay?

1083
00:40:05,051 --> 00:40:07,018
Oh, man!

1084
00:40:07,051 --> 00:40:08,151
You want me to call
the facility?

1085
00:40:08,185 --> 00:40:09,918
Nah, call the police first.

1086
00:40:09,951 --> 00:40:12,118
It's official. This has been one
of the worst days of my life.

1087
00:40:12,151 --> 00:40:14,218
Careful. Don't jinx yourself.

1088
00:40:14,251 --> 00:40:15,818
Goodnight, everyone.

1089
00:40:15,851 --> 00:40:17,585
‐ 'Happy birthday, Dr. Chen.'
‐ Oh, thanks.

1090
00:40:17,618 --> 00:40:19,651
‐ Hey, my gloves.
‐ What?

1091
00:40:19,685 --> 00:40:21,951
Camel colored with lamb skin
inside, are those mine?

1092
00:40:21,985 --> 00:40:24,518
‐ No.
‐ No. Greg just gave them to me.

1093
00:40:24,551 --> 00:40:25,885
They were in my
locker this morning.

1094
00:40:25,918 --> 00:40:28,085
Yeah, so what? I bought
those out on the street.

1095
00:40:28,118 --> 00:40:30,751
You bought these
on the street?

1096
00:40:30,785 --> 00:40:32,018
Yeah, from Kippy.

1097
00:40:32,051 --> 00:40:34,085
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ It's a long story.

1098
00:40:34,118 --> 00:40:35,185
Uh, I'm sorry.

1099
00:40:35,218 --> 00:40:37,985
Listen, I'm sorry,
I mean, what..

1100
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:41,218
I can't believe you bought my
birthday present on the street.

1101
00:40:41,251 --> 00:40:43,618
Yeah, but it was a good deal.
I mean, they're genuine leather.

1102
00:40:43,651 --> 00:40:45,585
If I were you, I'd put
them under a Wood's lamp.

1103
00:40:45,618 --> 00:40:48,251
Nice.

1104
00:40:48,285 --> 00:40:49,285
‐ Hey.
‐ Hey.

1105
00:40:49,318 --> 00:40:50,985
What are you doing here?

1106
00:40:51,018 --> 00:40:52,518
Well, I know we're not supposed
to see each other

1107
00:40:52,551 --> 00:40:53,685
until the lawyer's office,
but I figured

1108
00:40:53,718 --> 00:40:55,285
if your day was half
as bad as mine

1109
00:40:55,318 --> 00:40:57,851
maybe you could
use some company.

1110
00:40:57,885 --> 00:41:00,785
Well, eight‐year‐old
blinded by an air bag

1111
00:41:00,818 --> 00:41:02,251
woman keels over
of an aneurysm

1112
00:41:02,285 --> 00:41:03,951
junkie shooting up
in the ER

1113
00:41:03,985 --> 00:41:06,018
and a teenage Down's Syndrome
girl with the clap.

1114
00:41:06,051 --> 00:41:09,085
Hm, we had a family of four,
trapped in a burning vehicle

1115
00:41:09,118 --> 00:41:12,218
only one kid survived.
He's 18 months old.

1116
00:41:12,251 --> 00:41:13,585
You win.

1117
00:41:13,618 --> 00:41:14,618
What'd you get?

1118
00:41:14,651 --> 00:41:15,818
Oh, the, uh, burger

1119
00:41:15,851 --> 00:41:17,118
and fries we never got.

1120
00:41:22,665 --> 00:41:23,370
Knit one, purl two?

1121
00:41:23,404 --> 00:41:26,337
You take much longer,
you're gonna be sewing scabs.

1122
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:29,604
If I go faster, the edges
don't evert well.

1123
00:41:29,637 --> 00:41:31,337
I love watching
med students suture.

1124
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:33,070
It reminds me how good I am.

1125
00:41:34,237 --> 00:41:35,304
Was.

1126
00:41:38,404 --> 00:41:39,404
What did you say?

1127
00:41:39,437 --> 00:41:41,137
He said, "Was."

1128
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:49,104
Loose stools in Exam Four.
Knock yourself out.

1129
00:41:49,137 --> 00:41:50,937
We're almost there.

1130
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:53,337
Skin stapler will be next.

1131
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:57,004
‐ Cut, please.
‐ Pressure's steady at 110/68.

1132
00:41:57,037 --> 00:41:59,570
He's here.

1133
00:41:59,604 --> 00:42:01,370
Mr. Strickland..

1134
00:42:01,404 --> 00:42:03,570
...I'm afraid we've discovered

1135
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:06,370
a highly malignant
and inoperable cancer.

1136
00:42:06,404 --> 00:42:08,504
‐ God!
‐ Stapler ready.

1137
00:42:08,537 --> 00:42:10,937
Your‐your wife's
chance of survival

1138
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:13,004
even with the most aggressive
form of chemotherapy

1139
00:42:13,037 --> 00:42:15,170
is extremely poor.

1140
00:42:15,204 --> 00:42:17,570
But not impossible?

1141
00:42:17,604 --> 00:42:20,604
The one sure thing is that
she will survive long enough

1142
00:42:20,637 --> 00:42:22,037
to deliver your baby

1143
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:24,070
'if she doesn't seek treatment.'

1144
00:42:24,104 --> 00:42:25,404
However, in order
for that to happen

1145
00:42:25,437 --> 00:42:27,004
you'd have to reverse
her decision.

1146
00:42:27,037 --> 00:42:29,004
‐ OB's here.
‐ How close are we?

1147
00:42:29,037 --> 00:42:30,804
Almost closed.

1148
00:42:34,437 --> 00:42:36,604
Mr. Strickland.

1149
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:38,437
If you wish to overrule
your wife's decision

1150
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:40,237
you're going to have
to do it quickly.

1151
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:42,937
The GYN team here is standing
by to perform an abortion.

1152
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:48,237
I want her to live.

1153
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:50,470
Your wife is going to die.

1154
00:42:50,504 --> 00:42:52,237
She's gonna fight this.

1155
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:55,237
Do you understand
this baby has a chance?

1156
00:42:59,237 --> 00:43:02,204
I ca...I can't.
I just can't.

1157
00:43:02,237 --> 00:43:04,070
'Dr. Corday.'

1158
00:43:05,337 --> 00:43:06,570
Dr. Corday.

1159
00:43:06,604 --> 00:43:08,204
Mr. Strickland.

1160
00:43:13,504 --> 00:43:15,870
Let's get her draped.
Start with the sterile spec.

1161
00:43:33,237 --> 00:43:35,204
Another?

1162
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:37,037
Yeah.

1163
00:43:38,937 --> 00:43:40,370
And stop skimping
on the peanuts.

1164
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:50,037
Hey...how about putting
somethin' on

1165
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:52,237
for those of us in the room
without hairy knuckles?

1166
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:55,604
Something wrong
with this show?

1167
00:43:55,637 --> 00:43:57,537
Yeah, it only appeals to adults

1168
00:43:57,570 --> 00:44:00,404
making less than
20 grand a year.

1169
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:02,037
30 grand.

1170
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:05,204
Oh. Car wash gave
you a raise. Good for you.

1171
00:44:05,237 --> 00:44:07,170
I'm a copier tech.

1172
00:44:07,204 --> 00:44:09,904
Well, that explains
the dirty fingernails

1173
00:44:09,937 --> 00:44:13,270
but...not why you enjoy watching
half‐naked chunky‐trunks

1174
00:44:13,304 --> 00:44:14,937
pull tractors with their teeth.

1175
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:17,470
Must be some sort of homo‐erotic
thing for you, I guess?

1176
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:33,370
♪ And I'm goin' down ♪
