1
00:00:02,103 --> 00:00:04,403
<i>When my mother left my father,</i>

2
00:00:04,472 --> 00:00:07,117
<i>she didn't tell him she was
leaving and taking me with her</i>

3
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:10,542
<i>until we'd landed on the
other side of the country.</i>

4
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:14,179
<i>In those days, it was
called family troubles.</i>

5
00:00:14,248 --> 00:00:16,168
<i>Today, it'd be
called kidnapping.</i>

6
00:00:16,217 --> 00:00:18,050
Could you page
Dr. Shepherd one more time?

7
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:19,646
I paged him two minutes ago.

8
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,287
It's really very important that
I speak with him right away.

9
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,933
He's a brain surgeon.
Everyone looking for him

10
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:26,792
thinks it's really
very important.

11
00:00:26,844 --> 00:00:30,062
I'll let you know
when he calls back.

12
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,243
Sir, you know how I said I
wanted to do a Gunther today?

13
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:36,834
I sent you an e-mail with my new
screening criteria for my clinical trial.

14
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:38,370
Did you get a
chance to look at it?

15
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:40,706
Not yet. Torres has a
patient from the sinkhole,

16
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:42,307
she would be perfect for...

17
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:45,210
You know, I'm inserting an
islet cell device this afternoon.

18
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:46,756
I'd like you to be there,
see how it works, okay?

19
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,425
Oh, no. You're gonna
do a hundred of 'em.

20
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:49,659
Can I see the next one?
Today's just not a good day.

21
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:51,216
I'd like it to happen today.

22
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:54,168
No, sir. The fifth years
are at each other's throats.

23
00:00:54,237 --> 00:00:56,204
And it's affecting the work.

24
00:00:56,273 --> 00:00:57,984
I almost pulled a spleen out
of a man with a hole in his lung.

25
00:00:58,008 --> 00:01:00,487
I need you in this surgery. I can't
have you supervise a Gunther.

26
00:01:00,511 --> 00:01:02,831
Torres can supervise.
It's her patient.

27
00:01:03,514 --> 00:01:04,754
Who doesn't love a Gunther?

28
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:07,265
Fine. Do a Gunther.

29
00:01:07,318 --> 00:01:08,934
But be in my OR by 4:00.

30
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:10,135
4:00. Okay. Come on. Go.

31
00:01:12,189 --> 00:01:13,254
Cristina.

32
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:15,402
What are you doing?

33
00:01:15,426 --> 00:01:17,258
Oh, Bailey paged 911.

34
00:01:17,328 --> 00:01:18,839
Well, what happened
to the chest tube?

35
00:01:18,863 --> 00:01:20,929
An intern's doing it,
'cause it's intern's work,

36
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:22,631
which I love.

37
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,083
I'm loving the
back-to-the-basics thing.

38
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:27,352
It's so valuable,
but, 911, so...

39
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:28,899
Hey. Oh, and you have to go.

40
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:30,855
So no worries. We'll talk later.

41
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,861
I had such a good attitude
today, and now it's gone.

42
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:36,990
Dr. Webber called.

43
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:38,658
He's gonna put the thing in.

44
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:39,781
Now?

45
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,883
Uh, 4:00.

46
00:01:41,951 --> 00:01:43,551
They just call... Why
would he do that?

47
00:01:43,587 --> 00:01:44,797
I don't know, but
I'm not complaining.

48
00:01:44,821 --> 00:01:45,999
I just want the
damn thing over with.

49
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:48,841
So I'll call you
when I'm in a room.

50
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,659
Okay.

51
00:01:50,727 --> 00:01:51,860
Bye.

52
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,027
You see that? I wish I
did. I can't see anything.

53
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,496
Hold the nerve root retractor.

54
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,331
It's yours again, Dr. Shepherd.

55
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:03,182
Why is my pager going
off every 30 seconds?

56
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,256
Gloria's checking on it.

57
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:05,857
His SSEPs are coming back up.

58
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:08,966
There's still a lot
of epidural bleeding.

59
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:10,807
Dr. Shepherd, when
you have a second.

60
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:12,308
Does it look like
I have a second?

61
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:13,810
What the hell is the problem?

62
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:15,514
They said it's something
about your baby.

63
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,167
She was pinned under her car,

64
00:02:21,191 --> 00:02:23,358
her leg was amputated
in a pit of dirt,

65
00:02:23,426 --> 00:02:26,523
her abdomen is pulp, and
her pelvis is probably crushed.

66
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:28,046
You will work together

67
00:02:28,098 --> 00:02:30,193
to assess her injuries
and repair them.

68
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:31,316
In the OR?

69
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:33,218
No, at the Jiffy
Lube. Yes, in the OR.

70
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,336
Now, Dr. Torres will
supervise your work.

71
00:02:35,406 --> 00:02:36,632
If you're killing
her, she will step in.

72
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:37,918
Otherwise, you're on your own.

73
00:02:37,942 --> 00:02:39,607
Don't screw this up

74
00:02:39,676 --> 00:02:42,139
like you screwed everything
else up you've touched lately.

75
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:45,463
Ladies and gentlemen,
step away from the patient.

76
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,985
Is she... Is she here? - She is,

77
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,731
and as soon as...
I want to see her.

78
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:53,233
Hey, hang on. We need
to check you out first.

79
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:55,268
Does she know about her
leg? She's unconscious.

80
00:02:55,292 --> 00:02:57,509
All right? I'll go and see
how she's doing, okay?

81
00:02:57,578 --> 00:03:00,211
Hey, lie down.

82
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,080
I will see how she is doing.

83
00:03:02,132 --> 00:03:03,743
I'm gonna get someone
to take you to CT.

84
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:06,401
And then I will come
back with a full report.

85
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,303
Okay? Okay.

86
00:03:09,072 --> 00:03:10,855
All right.

87
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,502
It's an open-book
pelvic fracture.

88
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,003
And a comminuted femur fracture.

89
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,505
Has anyone fully
examined the stump?

90
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:18,530
Pneumopericardium and
an enlarged cardiac shadow.

91
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,732
She needs a chest tube and a CT.

92
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,634
Free fluid. She needs the OR.

93
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:25,314
An embolization and angio would
help stabilize the pelvic bleeding.

94
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:26,383
An angio's just
gonna waste time.

95
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:27,689
We could pack her in the OR.

96
00:03:27,757 --> 00:03:29,636
Call the OR, tell them to prep
for an emergent laparotomy.

97
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,742
Excuse me.

98
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:32,343
Oh, no, no.

99
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:34,713
What do you mean,
no? That's my patient.

100
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:36,610
We're doing a Gunther.
What the hell's a Gunther?

101
00:03:36,634 --> 00:03:38,274
It's, uh, like a
team-building exercise.

102
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,879
See, the hospital does
it when the residents

103
00:03:39,903 --> 00:03:42,104
aren't working well
together. It seems to help.

104
00:03:42,172 --> 00:03:43,817
If the patient doesn't die.
One time, the patient died,

105
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:45,121
and then it didn't help at all.

106
00:03:45,175 --> 00:03:47,559
So, what, they
prep her and then...

107
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:49,372
No, no, no. No attendings.
Just the bunnies.

108
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:50,695
In the OR?

109
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:52,492
Yes, the OR. Why does no
one seem to get that part?

110
00:03:52,516 --> 00:03:54,544
No, no. Not this patient.

111
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,296
I just pulled her out
of a hole in the ground

112
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,636
that almost ate her alive,

113
00:03:57,688 --> 00:04:00,066
and her husband
had to cut off her leg.

114
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,785
Dr. Torres will be there
every step of the way.

115
00:04:01,809 --> 00:04:03,102
Bailey... They can handle this.

116
00:04:03,126 --> 00:04:04,425
I said no.

117
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:07,763
The Chief said yes. I'm sorry.

118
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,492
Oh, yeah? Who died
and made you God?

119
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:10,894
Okay, look, I think
what we need to do is

120
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,395
we just need to take a moment...

121
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,014
April, you're chief resident,
not chief of surgery.

122
00:04:14,038 --> 00:04:15,404
Did somebody call the OR?

123
00:04:15,472 --> 00:04:17,616
No, because she needs a CT
to assess her cardiac injuries.

124
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,835
What did I say about...
No one gives a crap

125
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:19,874
what you have to say.

126
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,075
Still want to take
her to Radiology?

127
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:27,310
Maybe wait in line for a little
while till the machine's free?

128
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:28,974
Is somebody gonna call the OR?

129
00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:31,347
They're still
finding their groove.

130
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,087
Mmm.

131
00:04:33,156 --> 00:04:34,868
<i>You've reached
Dr. Meredith Grey. I can't...</i>

132
00:04:34,892 --> 00:04:36,703
Let's check the liver first.
It's the most likely source.

133
00:04:36,727 --> 00:04:37,959
What? No.

134
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:39,672
Hey, Yang. Where's
Meredith? I don't know.

135
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:40,823
She's in cardiogenic shock.
That's our main concern.

136
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,246
Yang... They fired her.

137
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:44,394
Maybe she's putting
anthrax in Karev's locker.

138
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:45,828
BP's tanking. We
need to up her fluids.

139
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,046
No. Her pericardium is
filled with air and blood.

140
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,113
Do you listen to
anyone else, ever?

141
00:04:48,137 --> 00:04:49,181
All the time. Just not you.

142
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,355
Or me, apparently.

143
00:04:50,424 --> 00:04:51,867
She's not answering
her phone or her pager.

144
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:53,636
I haven't seen her. I was in
the pit. She's not in the pit.

145
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,338
I was in the elevator.
She's not in the elevator.

146
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:56,895
Page Dr. Grey.

147
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,541
I just did, sir.
She didn't answer.

148
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:00,031
Page her again.

149
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:14,912
Chief, Henry just told
me that you called him in

150
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,247
to insert the device today.

151
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,649
Yeah. I had an opening.

152
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:19,929
Well, but he hasn't
had his pre-op labs

153
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:21,096
and he hasn't had...

154
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,298
Well, we can rush
the labs. It'll be fine.

155
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,766
Well, but he could
come in in a week.

156
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,385
I mean, it just seems a
little weird to race him...

157
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:28,009
Look, it is a simple procedure.
It'll be over in an hour.

158
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:30,261
Don't worry about it.

159
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:32,897
Dr. Bailey.

160
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:35,400
I wanted to keep an
eye on the Gunther.

161
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:36,835
An intern just pulled me...

162
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:37,936
I need you now.

163
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:47,813
You need to spend
some time with the mice.

164
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:50,482
This is why I left my Gunther?

165
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:52,751
Once you put a couple
of devices in mice,

166
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,354
putting one in a
human's a breeze.

167
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:57,021
All that space.

168
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,372
Sir,

169
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,141
I have a full schedule

170
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,838
that I already had to take apart

171
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,758
so I could watch you put this
thing in a person this afternoon.

172
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:06,164
Henry, Altman's husband.

173
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:08,094
I would like to keep
an eye on the Gunther...

174
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,551
Put on a mask, Dr. Bailey.

175
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,585
Even with mice, you
need a sterile field.

176
00:06:15,943 --> 00:06:20,594
This is mouse T.

177
00:06:20,663 --> 00:06:23,682
He's skinny. So
it won't be easy.

178
00:06:27,204 --> 00:06:28,836
Get yourself some gloves.

179
00:06:31,407 --> 00:06:33,385
Danny, you have a little
bit of blood in your brain,

180
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:35,554
so I'm gonna have one of my
colleagues take a look at your films.

181
00:06:35,578 --> 00:06:36,645
Is it bad?

182
00:06:36,713 --> 00:06:38,079
It's probably nothing,

183
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:39,208
but I just don't want
to take any chances.

184
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,632
Did Susannah wake up?

185
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:43,000
They're starting
her surgery now.

186
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,436
And she does have
some internal bleeding

187
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:47,121
that they need to repair.

188
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,101
Well, when will... When
will you tell her about her leg,

189
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,224
after the surgery?

190
00:06:50,293 --> 00:06:52,038
We'll just see how
it goes, all right?

191
00:06:52,062 --> 00:06:54,479
But will she be able to feel it?

192
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:56,559
I mean, what if she
sees it... Danny...

193
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,550
Her leg is not the big
problem right now, okay?

194
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:00,312
She just needs to get
through the surgery.

195
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:03,421
But she has an incredible
team working on her.

196
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,991
Really, they're unbelievable.

197
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:07,687
<i>Give me a 10-blade, please.</i>

198
00:07:07,711 --> 00:07:09,522
Don't give her a 10-blade. The
woman just had her leg hacked off.

199
00:07:09,546 --> 00:07:10,823
She doesn't need
her chest cracked open

200
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,191
for something we're
not even sure she has.

201
00:07:12,215 --> 00:07:14,633
Yeah, well, I'm sure,
and if her heart craps out,

202
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:16,178
she's not gonna give a
rat's ass about her leg.

203
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:17,580
Look, we know
that she is bleeding

204
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:18,948
from her pelvis and her abdomen,

205
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:20,683
which gives her plenty of
reason to be hypotensive.

206
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:22,118
Let's just do an x-lap and
see what we're dealing with.

207
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:23,670
No! Karev, start the incision.

208
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:26,505
Why him? Just because you're
pissed that I'm chief resident

209
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,040
doesn't mean that you
can pretend I'm not here.

210
00:07:28,064 --> 00:07:29,675
Nobody cares that
you're chief resident.

211
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,434
Can everyone just shut up,
please? We are wasting time arguing.

212
00:07:32,502 --> 00:07:35,103
<i>The only logical conclusion
is take care of the heart first.</i>

213
00:07:35,171 --> 00:07:36,755
Hey, is the ER still a zoo?

214
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:40,141
No, they got everyone who
survived out of the hole a while ago.

215
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,021
- It's quieted down.
<i>- I'm right.</i>

216
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:44,212
<i>The changes were
subtle on the x-ray...</i>

217
00:07:44,281 --> 00:07:45,741
She got the
crossword down there?

218
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:47,548
Sudoku. You ever try it?

219
00:07:47,617 --> 00:07:49,577
Bores the crap out of me. Amen.

220
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:51,881
<i>You're outvoted, Yang.</i>

221
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:54,186
Who do you think the Gunther is?

222
00:07:54,657 --> 00:07:55,907
What do you mean?

223
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,275
Is this your first one?

224
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:01,156
Hmm. The name Gunther comes
from the doctor, not the patient.

225
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,159
One of the residents always
kind of emerges as a leader

226
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:05,133
when they do this.

227
00:08:05,202 --> 00:08:06,813
And the first time, it was this
little quiet guy named Gunther,

228
00:08:06,837 --> 00:08:08,581
and everyone thought he was
gonna flame out of the program,

229
00:08:08,605 --> 00:08:10,449
but it turns out, he's
the alpha dog. Great.

230
00:08:10,473 --> 00:08:12,773
We know it won't be Avery.
He doesn't have any balls.

231
00:08:12,842 --> 00:08:14,670
Well, Karev's got the balls,
but everyone hates him.

232
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,756
So I don't really see
them following his lead.

233
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,629
Bound to be Yang.

234
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:22,366
I don't know. Kepner's kind
of a dark horse these days.

235
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:23,580
<i>You'll realize that
the heart is a very...</i>

236
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:25,754
You feel good
about that position?

237
00:08:26,156 --> 00:08:27,222
Huh?

238
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,257
You willing to back that up?

239
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,526
What, like, 50 bucks?

240
00:08:34,497 --> 00:08:35,529
Bring it.

241
00:08:39,736 --> 00:08:41,036
How are they doing?

242
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,082
Still trying to agree
where to start.

243
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:47,625
I just had to put an
islet-cell device in a mouse.

244
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,972
Do you know how small
a mouse's omentum is?

245
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:53,297
I'm gonna go with really small.

246
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,194
<i>Up the dopamine to 15.</i>

247
00:08:55,218 --> 00:08:56,445
Happy now? She's bottoming out.

248
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:57,863
Well, if we'd get in
there and pack the pelvis,

249
00:08:57,887 --> 00:08:59,265
that alone will help
the blood pressure...

250
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,283
Well, yeah, I hope so, 'cause
her systolic's down to 68.

251
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:02,618
Because her heart
is exploding. Okay...

252
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,592
Is this where I step in?

253
00:09:04,661 --> 00:09:05,971
Stabilize the internal bleeding

254
00:09:05,995 --> 00:09:07,557
and then we can get a
TEE while we're in there...

255
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:08,708
Yang! What are you doing?

256
00:09:08,732 --> 00:09:10,042
Opening her chest.
What does it look like?

257
00:09:10,066 --> 00:09:11,783
Rib spreader.

258
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:13,401
Oh, my God.

259
00:09:16,673 --> 00:09:19,974
We'll have these lab
results back in a few minutes,

260
00:09:20,043 --> 00:09:21,654
then you'll get
a happy cocktail,

261
00:09:21,678 --> 00:09:23,256
and they'll take
you up to the OR.

262
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,224
I mean, his glucose levels
aren't spiking or anything?

263
00:09:25,248 --> 00:09:26,308
No. I mean, nothing that would

264
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:27,360
make you want to push this up?

265
00:09:27,384 --> 00:09:28,478
Nothing. We got an opening...

266
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:30,334
Opening, right. Okay.

267
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:32,536
Are you nervous?

268
00:09:33,356 --> 00:09:34,639
No.

269
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,507
She's nervous. It's kinda cute.

270
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,636
All right.

271
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,227
I'm gonna go.

272
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,768
I love you so much.

273
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:51,089
And you have made me so happy.

274
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:52,857
I mean, like...

275
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,859
Like really,

276
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:58,496
really happy for the first
time in my life, I think.

277
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,649
Are you saying goodbye?

278
00:10:01,717 --> 00:10:03,735
No. No. No.

279
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:06,137
'Cause you keep telling me,
this is a simple procedure.

280
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:07,250
It is. It is.

281
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:08,706
It, it'll, um...

282
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,558
It'll, it'll, it'll be fine.

283
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:12,043
Yeah, but that sounded like,

284
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,679
"And if I never see you
again, remember I love you."

285
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:16,431
It did.

286
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:19,551
I should go.

287
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,719
I think it's a good idea.

288
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:24,356
It's a rim subdural.
It'll probably reabsorb.

289
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:26,569
I'm not that concerned.
You should keep an eye on it.

290
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:27,625
Good.

291
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:30,695
Everything all right?

292
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,897
Uh, Meredith
disappeared with Zola.

293
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,527
What do you mean,
she disappeared?

294
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,785
She had a rough day.

295
00:10:37,854 --> 00:10:40,016
She probably just
went out for a walk.

296
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,523
Derek, there are a hundred
possible explanations.

297
00:10:42,592 --> 00:10:43,769
Don't assume the worst.

298
00:10:43,793 --> 00:10:45,293
You know why I do that?

299
00:10:45,361 --> 00:10:46,494
Because lately,

300
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,329
the level of insanity
in my wife's behavior

301
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:49,663
defies imagination.

302
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,777
I know, but sometimes,
even with Cristina,

303
00:10:51,801 --> 00:10:54,001
sometimes, they surprise us.

304
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,484
<i>Got some bleeding In
the upper right quadrant.</i>

305
00:10:58,508 --> 00:11:00,708
<i>Give me more
suction and lap pads.</i>

306
00:11:00,777 --> 00:11:02,521
<i>Do you see any bile or
pancreatic secretions?</i>

307
00:11:02,545 --> 00:11:03,822
<i>None here.</i> ALEX: <i>Negative.</i>

308
00:11:03,846 --> 00:11:06,213
Hey, I'm watching
Henry's surgery today.

309
00:11:06,283 --> 00:11:07,449
Why?

310
00:11:07,517 --> 00:11:10,034
'Cause the Chief
loves an audience.

311
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:12,014
Not because he's worried
that something's wrong

312
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:13,533
and he wants you there to help?

313
00:11:13,557 --> 00:11:15,356
I don't think so.

314
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,174
Have his ACCU-CHEKs been bad?

315
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:19,088
No, but he wasn't
supposed to be in surgery

316
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:20,206
for another two weeks...

317
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,308
And then this morning,
he calls Henry up

318
00:11:22,332 --> 00:11:23,743
and has him race
into the hospital...

319
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:25,800
He's getting batty
in his old age.

320
00:11:25,869 --> 00:11:28,481
Oh, well, that's great, 'cause he's
cutting open my husband today.

321
00:11:28,505 --> 00:11:31,272
I'll be standing there,
contemplating my mortality.

322
00:11:31,341 --> 00:11:33,708
If the batty acts
up, I'll lend a hand.

323
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,778
Something is not right.

324
00:11:36,847 --> 00:11:38,758
<i>You can detach the
omentum from the anterior...</i>

325
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:40,622
You know what you sound like?

326
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:42,600
A wife.

327
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:44,418
Cardiac rupture, like I said.

328
00:11:44,487 --> 00:11:45,819
A lot of bleeding down here.

329
00:11:45,888 --> 00:11:47,717
Jackson, help her
hold pressure there.

330
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:49,117
Lap pads down in there, please.

331
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:51,075
Looks like Yang's the Gunther.

332
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:52,527
Yep. No surprise.

333
00:11:52,595 --> 00:11:53,672
What does that mean?

334
00:11:53,696 --> 00:11:55,374
It means she took
over while everyone else

335
00:11:55,398 --> 00:11:57,198
is standing around
looking like idiots

336
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,682
doing whatever she says.

337
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:01,102
I mean, look at Avery. Useless.

338
00:12:01,171 --> 00:12:06,791
I gotta go. Kepner.
What was I thinking?

339
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:10,511
Oh, no. No, no. This is the
opposite of what she should be doing.

340
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,024
I'm trying to teach
her some humility,

341
00:12:12,048 --> 00:12:13,993
and she's running the
OR on a massive trauma.

342
00:12:14,017 --> 00:12:15,182
What can you do?

343
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:17,701
Some people are
racehorses. She's a racehorse.

344
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:19,703
V-fib.

345
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:20,892
I need the paddles.

346
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:24,242
<i>Charge to 20.</i>

347
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:26,143
Clear.

348
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:28,907
No change.

349
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:30,576
I need one of intracardiac epi.

350
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,660
Someone take over
massaging the heart.

351
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:32,924
I got it.

352
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:35,937
Ow! Oh, my God.

353
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,708
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Alex?

354
00:12:40,776 --> 00:12:42,016
Look at me.

355
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:44,903
Alex, look at me. Alex?

356
00:12:46,883 --> 00:12:48,577
Oh, my God, Alex! What the...

357
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,700
<i>Alex!</i>

358
00:12:50,887 --> 00:12:51,981
Racehorse?

359
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:53,005
My bad.

360
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:56,293
<i>What the hell just happened?</i>

361
00:12:57,978 --> 00:12:59,710
Epi. Give me another epi.

362
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:00,839
Here you go, Doctor.

363
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,330
I can't find a pulse.

364
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,859
Why the hell doesn't he have
a pulse? I need a crash cart.

365
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,444
An epi doesn't stop a
healthy person's heart.

366
00:13:05,468 --> 00:13:07,235
What did you do? I don't know.

367
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,881
Her heart's back. I'm gonna
deal with the pericardium.

368
00:13:08,905 --> 00:13:10,916
Forget about the pelvis for now.

369
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,084
She's bleeding through the
packing in the right upper quadrant.

370
00:13:12,108 --> 00:13:13,258
Should I repack it?

371
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:14,503
Try a Pringle
maneuver. Graft, please.

372
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,794
Hey, get me and Dr. Altman
gowned and gloved,

373
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:18,007
and I need
something to stand on.

374
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:19,391
Dr. Bailey, it's under control.

375
00:13:19,415 --> 00:13:20,892
We got a lot of hands in
here, and two more surgeons

376
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,177
are only gonna confuse matters.

377
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:23,946
I'm gonna ask you
to step back, please.

378
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,699
Can I get another pledgeted
3-0 prolene? Suction.

379
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,473
V-fib. Charging to 200.

380
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,607
Clear.

381
00:13:31,494 --> 00:13:32,726
Alex?

382
00:13:32,795 --> 00:13:34,695
Alex? Alex, can
you hear me? Alex?

383
00:13:34,764 --> 00:13:36,481
You crazy bitch.

384
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,332
You almost killed me.

385
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:39,617
Oh.

386
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:41,252
I called home. I
scoured the hospital.

387
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:44,889
I even had an intern
call every ER in the city

388
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,235
to make sure she
wasn't run over by a bus.

389
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:48,292
There's no simple explanation.

390
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:50,812
Why don't you let me
handle talking to Nicky's dad?

391
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:52,537
I don't mind. I'm fine.

392
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,013
How is he?

393
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,954
There were three
fractures in Nicky's spine.

394
00:14:00,023 --> 00:14:01,589
We repaired the damage.

395
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,857
Looks like,
neurologically, he's intact.

396
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,726
This is the "wait and see" part.

397
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:07,478
Can I see him?

398
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:08,779
He's in recovery right now.

399
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,359
They're not gonna
let you see him.

400
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:15,786
I can't believe that
this is happening.

401
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:17,766
We were just walking
down the street,

402
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,375
talking about why
people don't have gills.

403
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:24,215
I was holding his
hand, and he just...

404
00:14:25,514 --> 00:14:26,847
Slipped away.

405
00:14:29,352 --> 00:14:31,764
How do you go through the
day when one minute to the next,

406
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,621
your child could just...

407
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:35,122
Excuse me.

408
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,212
I'm sorry.

409
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:42,463
He's...

410
00:14:44,233 --> 00:14:45,633
Let's go find Nicky.

411
00:14:45,702 --> 00:14:47,312
I thought you said they
weren't gonna let me see him.

412
00:14:47,336 --> 00:14:48,613
Well, we're gonna
figure something out.

413
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,304
You need to see your son.

414
00:14:50,373 --> 00:14:51,588
Don't touch me.

415
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:53,568
I'm not touching you.
Don't touch my gurney!

416
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:55,570
All right, get this
artery. See right there?

417
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:56,939
Yeah. Good.

418
00:14:56,963 --> 00:14:58,862
Now do a tie on the hemostat.

419
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:00,125
Who'd have thunk it?

420
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,782
Avery's the Gunther.

421
00:15:01,851 --> 00:15:03,091
What the hell happened?

422
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,303
Yang almost killed Karev,
and Avery's the Gunther.

423
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:07,088
Avery? Get outta here.

424
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,222
Hand to God.

425
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:09,823
Avery...

426
00:15:09,892 --> 00:15:11,826
Good job, son.

427
00:15:11,894 --> 00:15:13,044
Thank you.

428
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:14,513
I'm right here if
you need anything.

429
00:15:15,632 --> 00:15:17,164
Oh, damn it.

430
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:18,566
My guy won.

431
00:15:20,636 --> 00:15:22,503
We're gonna be great together.

432
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:31,195
Sorry.

433
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,598
A little hiccup in the Gunther.

434
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,916
Well, take your time.

435
00:15:35,985 --> 00:15:39,404
You know, I've seen you
open an abdomen before.

436
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:40,604
Whereas Dr. Grey...

437
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:42,401
I don't want an
observer. I want an assist.

438
00:15:42,425 --> 00:15:43,791
Oh, okay. Is something wrong?

439
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,187
No, this is a teaching hospital.

440
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:46,844
And you're not too old to learn.

441
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:48,941
Yeah, but it'd be good
experience for Grey to see...

442
00:15:48,965 --> 00:15:52,183
Dr. Bailey, if wanted a
resident's help, I'd ask for it.

443
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,421
Here you go, Doctor. Thank you.

444
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:02,126
Whenever you're ready.

445
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:04,289
All right, then get back
to me with her post-op crit.

446
00:16:04,313 --> 00:16:06,758
And make sure you're aggressive
with the dressings on her leg.

447
00:16:06,782 --> 00:16:08,627
I'm still worried about
an infection. Okay.

448
00:16:08,651 --> 00:16:09,950
Hey.

449
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:12,300
You know why she just
did what he said, right?

450
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:14,429
Because he's the Gunther.

451
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:17,124
How did it go?

452
00:16:17,193 --> 00:16:18,804
We'll have to go back
for definitive repairs,

453
00:16:18,828 --> 00:16:20,038
but we stopped the
major hemorrhaging,

454
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,340
got the leg all
cleaned out. Good.

455
00:16:21,364 --> 00:16:23,364
Nice work today,
Avery. Thank you.

456
00:16:23,433 --> 00:16:25,198
I just hope she pulls through.

457
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:28,820
How's Alex?

458
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,022
He should be fine.

459
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:34,208
Apparently, he had an
underlying arrhythmia,

460
00:16:34,276 --> 00:16:35,776
so the epi...

461
00:16:40,817 --> 00:16:42,444
I was moving too fast
and I made a mistake.

462
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:43,785
You think?

463
00:16:49,993 --> 00:16:51,508
Boy, you got a mean streak.

464
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:54,245
I mean, you look
like a nice girl, but,

465
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,080
scratch the surface...

466
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:02,718
Don't mess with the nice ones.

467
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:23,140
I think I stole a baby.

468
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:31,249
Okay, first of all, you
didn't steal the baby.

469
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:32,399
She's your baby.

470
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,335
What you did is,

471
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:38,155
you took her for a nap.

472
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:42,727
In a very odd location and
you failed to answer your phone.

473
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,378
But, you know,

474
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:47,565
many people find all the
technology in our lives to be intrusive.

475
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:50,114
So you're not the first person
who didn't answer her phone...

476
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,720
Or her pager.

477
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:55,065
Well, and, you know,
all we have to do

478
00:17:55,124 --> 00:17:58,109
is find a reason why you
were AWOL for an hour.

479
00:17:58,177 --> 00:17:59,259
Four,

480
00:18:00,696 --> 00:18:02,413
hours.

481
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:05,477
Janet was gonna take
the baby, so I took off.

482
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,068
Okay. Okay.

483
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,537
You know, people make mistakes.

484
00:18:10,606 --> 00:18:12,840
I mean, I almost killed
Alex in the OR today.

485
00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:14,775
So we'll just figure it out.

486
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:15,859
How?

487
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,156
I don't know. No.

488
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,478
How'd you almost kill Alex?

489
00:18:20,149 --> 00:18:21,849
With a CC of epi.

490
00:18:21,918 --> 00:18:24,284
Whatever. You
know, he'll be fine.

491
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,353
Just...

492
00:18:26,422 --> 00:18:28,840
Just stay here. I'll fix this.

493
00:18:28,892 --> 00:18:30,257
What are you gonna do?

494
00:18:30,326 --> 00:18:31,625
I'm gonna fix it.

495
00:18:34,329 --> 00:18:36,414
Hand me a 10-blade, please.

496
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:41,746
Have to be careful not to cut
too deep into the omentum.

497
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:42,837
Uh, Dr. Webber.

498
00:18:42,905 --> 00:18:44,155
Yes.

499
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:46,340
Hi. Teddy Altman here.

500
00:18:46,409 --> 00:18:47,908
Yeah, nice to see you.

501
00:18:47,976 --> 00:18:50,811
I thought that Dr. Bailey
was just observing.

502
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:54,119
Yeah, well, she's here, so
she's gonna make herself useful.

503
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:56,717
Dr. Webber, I'm a surgeon.

504
00:18:56,786 --> 00:18:57,980
That's the word on the street.

505
00:18:58,004 --> 00:19:00,170
You have an
attending assisting you

506
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:03,156
in a simple subcutaneous
device insertion.

507
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:07,728
You rushed Henry into
surgery with an hour's notice.

508
00:19:07,797 --> 00:19:10,125
What... What are you not
telling me? Dr. Altman...

509
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,200
Is there something that he
didn't tell me about his checkups?

510
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:15,686
I mean, is his HbA1c too high?

511
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:17,521
Here we go. Look, I am a doctor

512
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,841
and I know when something is
wrong, and something is wrong.

513
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:24,845
Dr. Altman, I'm fond of you, so
I'm gonna count to 30 in my head

514
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:27,265
before I call security.

515
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,950
Richard, I'm just asking you...

516
00:19:29,018 --> 00:19:31,318
Get out of my OR right now.

517
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:47,997
I don't need to be here.
They just want to observe me

518
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,698
and make sure I
don't pass out again.

519
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:50,888
Mmm.

520
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:52,823
Not a bad idea.

521
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:54,791
How'd the kid do?

522
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,276
He has a few spinal fractures,

523
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,195
but it looks like he's
out of the woods.

524
00:19:58,264 --> 00:20:00,030
You need to make
up with your friends.

525
00:20:00,582 --> 00:20:01,582
Whatever.

526
00:20:01,651 --> 00:20:03,651
One of them almost
killed you today.

527
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,720
It was an accident.

528
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,253
Nobody has your back.

529
00:20:06,322 --> 00:20:08,038
Nobody is looking out for you.

530
00:20:08,107 --> 00:20:09,385
That's when accidents
happen, okay?

531
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:11,041
This isn't a personal problem.

532
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,230
This is a professional one.

533
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:15,279
It makes you a bad hire.

534
00:20:18,901 --> 00:20:21,218
Also, it means that I
have to worry about you,

535
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:24,154
because no one else is.

536
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,257
And I don't want
to worry about you.

537
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:28,825
I'd much rather be kicking
your ass on my Peds ward.

538
00:20:51,267 --> 00:20:52,433
Cristina.

539
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,191
Do you want to sit
and talk for a minute?

540
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,229
I do. I...

541
00:21:05,298 --> 00:21:08,015
I really very much do,

542
00:21:08,084 --> 00:21:09,694
but I have to go do
something right now,

543
00:21:09,718 --> 00:21:11,001
and it can't wait.

544
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:13,104
Please,

545
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:14,733
please believe that
I want to talk to you

546
00:21:14,757 --> 00:21:18,159
and I'm not blowing you off
because I'm a terrible person

547
00:21:18,227 --> 00:21:19,826
or because I don't
care about you.

548
00:21:19,896 --> 00:21:21,328
None of that is true.

549
00:21:32,341 --> 00:21:33,674
She okay?

550
00:21:33,743 --> 00:21:34,903
No change.

551
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,495
I just...

552
00:21:37,563 --> 00:21:40,742
I don't want to mess this up
like I messed up everything else.

553
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:43,116
What? You were great in the OR.

554
00:21:43,185 --> 00:21:46,403
I wasn't the Gunther. I
was a super-duper assistant.

555
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,503
Are they gonna fire
me as chief resident?

556
00:21:51,527 --> 00:21:52,793
No.

557
00:21:52,861 --> 00:21:54,261
It was your first day.

558
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:57,431
They'll just make
you do it again.

559
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:05,155
It's time to place the device.

560
00:22:10,712 --> 00:22:12,045
What do you want me to do?

561
00:22:12,114 --> 00:22:13,314
Place the device.

562
00:22:16,619 --> 00:22:19,736
Sir, is there anything
you want to tell me?

563
00:22:20,456 --> 00:22:21,806
Don't screw it up.

564
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:28,479
A surgeon doing the early stages

565
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:31,498
of human trials on his
experimental procedure

566
00:22:31,567 --> 00:22:34,685
never hands over the
reins to someone else, ever!

567
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:36,170
Unless something is wrong.

568
00:22:36,238 --> 00:22:37,838
Altman said this was weird,

569
00:22:37,906 --> 00:22:40,469
I just thought she was
being a wife. Bailey...

570
00:22:40,493 --> 00:22:41,733
Are you drinking again?

571
00:22:43,062 --> 00:22:44,707
Ooh! That would explain a lot.

572
00:22:44,731 --> 00:22:45,762
Yes, it would.

573
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:47,731
God, I wish it were that simple.

574
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,000
Pick up those
forceps, Dr. Bailey.

575
00:22:56,875 --> 00:23:00,878
Now watch the superficial
arteries. That's where it gets dicey.

576
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:02,863
Let's get more
retraction, Dr. Grey.

577
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:08,518
Right. Okay. Don't,
don't, don't rush it. All right.

578
00:23:08,588 --> 00:23:11,104
You see those
blood vessels? Yep.

579
00:23:11,174 --> 00:23:14,574
Implant the device as
close to those as possible.

580
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,476
Without their oxygen supply,

581
00:23:16,545 --> 00:23:18,712
the islet cells would die off.

582
00:23:19,281 --> 00:23:21,131
Good.

583
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:23,634
And eventually, the vessels

584
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:26,920
will just take over
the oxygen delivery

585
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:29,089
to the device completely.

586
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:31,108
Look at that.

587
00:23:31,177 --> 00:23:32,259
It's interesting, right?

588
00:23:33,562 --> 00:23:35,628
It's actually kind of beautiful.

589
00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:38,598
Nice work, Dr. Bailey.

590
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:40,984
Close him up.

591
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,593
Did... Did... Did he just...

592
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:54,097
He just left?

593
00:23:55,802 --> 00:23:57,401
Get up.

594
00:23:57,469 --> 00:24:01,972
No. I'm under 24-hour observation
because you almost killed me!

595
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:04,052
I revealed an arrhythmia
you didn't know you have.

596
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:05,154
I probably saved your life.

597
00:24:05,178 --> 00:24:06,938
I'll run an EKG on
you later. Just get up.

598
00:24:06,962 --> 00:24:08,862
You're supposed to have my back.

599
00:24:08,931 --> 00:24:10,247
I made a mistake.

600
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:11,582
All right? I was drunk,

601
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,278
I was pissed off...
Oh, for the love of...

602
00:24:13,302 --> 00:24:15,536
No, I screwed up! You
screw up all the time.

603
00:24:15,604 --> 00:24:18,071
I don't have anybody.
You guys are all I have.

604
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,868
You have to forgive me! Fine!

605
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:21,257
Whatever. Forgiven.

606
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:24,077
Just... Get up out
of the damn bed.

607
00:24:27,249 --> 00:24:28,982
Oh, sorry. I was paged here.

608
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:30,283
That was us.

609
00:24:30,352 --> 00:24:31,663
We paged your wife, too.
Do you know where she is?

610
00:24:31,687 --> 00:24:33,131
Well, that is the
question of the hour.

611
00:24:33,155 --> 00:24:34,604
I have no idea where she is.

612
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:37,341
Well, we'll fill her in later.
Shut the door, please.

613
00:24:41,347 --> 00:24:43,714
Dr. Webber just informed
me that he tampered with

614
00:24:43,783 --> 00:24:45,949
the drugs and placebos
in your clinical trial.

615
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:47,569
Excuse me?

616
00:24:49,771 --> 00:24:52,372
No, it was Meredith.

617
00:24:52,441 --> 00:24:55,325
Dr. Grey apparently
was covering for him.

618
00:24:55,394 --> 00:24:57,761
She knew and she

619
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,096
was trying to protect him.

620
00:25:01,717 --> 00:25:03,317
You have my apologies.

621
00:25:06,321 --> 00:25:07,972
I destroyed your trial.

622
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:19,866
She wasn't covering for you.

623
00:25:19,936 --> 00:25:21,235
What the hell are you doing?

624
00:25:21,303 --> 00:25:23,297
I'm protecting your wife.
What are you doing?

625
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:24,549
This is wrong,
and you know that.

626
00:25:24,573 --> 00:25:26,151
What are you
trying to do to her?

627
00:25:26,175 --> 00:25:28,876
She was trying to save Adele.
She was trying to save me.

628
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:31,384
At what point are you gonna
stop punishing her for that?

629
00:25:38,738 --> 00:25:40,404
And there's no pain
in your abdomen?

630
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:41,622
Nope.

631
00:25:42,858 --> 00:25:44,658
Really? Or are you
just being stoic for me?

632
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:47,238
I'm a man in a gown. I can't
pretend to be brave and strong.

633
00:25:47,262 --> 00:25:48,361
You can.

634
00:25:50,165 --> 00:25:51,531
I kinda lost it today.

635
00:25:52,768 --> 00:25:54,852
Dr. Webber kicked
me out of the OR.

636
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,353
Really?

637
00:25:56,422 --> 00:25:58,555
Okay, um, so...

638
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:06,529
You know how we both
figured that since I was a doctor,

639
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:10,350
that I would be really calm while
you were having your surgery?

640
00:26:10,419 --> 00:26:11,518
Mmm-hmm.

641
00:26:11,587 --> 00:26:12,919
That may not be the case.

642
00:26:15,708 --> 00:26:18,219
You're just a mess, like
any ordinary wife would be?

643
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,410
Yeah, it's pathetic.

644
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,413
I think it's adorable.

645
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:28,085
I have a chronic
tumor condition.

646
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:30,233
I'm a frequent flyer in the OR.

647
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:35,459
I'm gonna be a
basket case every time.

648
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,211
So sad.

649
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:51,358
If you're headed in there,
you may want to wait.

650
00:26:51,427 --> 00:26:53,977
They're acting like he just
came back from the wars.

651
00:26:55,314 --> 00:26:57,064
What?

652
00:26:57,133 --> 00:26:59,493
Something happened
with the chief.

653
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:06,501
Where have you been?

654
00:27:06,525 --> 00:27:08,470
We've been trying
to reach you for hours.

655
00:27:08,494 --> 00:27:09,526
I'm sorry.

656
00:27:09,578 --> 00:27:11,411
Where's Zola?

657
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:24,652
Hey. Susannah just
got out of surgery,

658
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:26,955
and it went as well
as it could have.

659
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:29,219
We're not gonna know
much for a little while.

660
00:27:30,366 --> 00:27:31,515
Look right here.

661
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:33,666
We had such an
awful fight right before.

662
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,481
I brought up her
mother in an argument,

663
00:27:37,505 --> 00:27:40,090
and that is one
of the red buttons.

664
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,826
I swore I would never
do that. Why did I do that?

665
00:27:42,895 --> 00:27:45,495
She'll forgive you.
You saved her life.

666
00:27:45,564 --> 00:27:47,764
Maybe for a while,
and then she'll get better

667
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,867
and she'll remember
why she got out of the car.

668
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:52,369
Maybe she won't. You know?

669
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:55,939
Maybe you both just
decide to forget, move on.

670
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:58,642
Pretend it never happened.

671
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:59,976
Does that work?

672
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:02,895
It can't hurt to try.

673
00:28:04,032 --> 00:28:05,032
You married?

674
00:28:08,254 --> 00:28:11,037
I'm sorry. It's not my
business. I didn't mean to pry.

675
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,240
Oh, that's all right. Yes.

676
00:28:13,308 --> 00:28:14,975
Yes, I'm married.

677
00:28:16,845 --> 00:28:18,845
What did you do?

678
00:28:18,914 --> 00:28:21,493
I want you to shut the door
and then I want you to sit down.

679
00:28:21,517 --> 00:28:23,701
You're throwing your
whole career away

680
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:25,169
for that damn girl?

681
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:27,031
This is not the
end of my career.

682
00:28:27,055 --> 00:28:29,339
The FDA will never come
anywhere near you again.

683
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:31,458
That is the end of
your islet cell trial,

684
00:28:31,527 --> 00:28:33,689
not to mention any other thing you
might be cooking up with the FDA...

685
00:28:33,713 --> 00:28:34,713
Sit down!

686
00:28:37,166 --> 00:28:38,531
You...

687
00:28:42,788 --> 00:28:43,788
Open it.

688
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:45,622
What...

689
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:48,625
And read the first page.

690
00:28:48,694 --> 00:28:51,077
"The Artificial
Pancreas: A Cure for..."

691
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,979
How about, "The
Artificial Pancreas:

692
00:28:53,048 --> 00:28:56,383
"A Huge Missed Opportunity
That You Blew Because You..."

693
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:58,101
Read the next line.

694
00:29:00,156 --> 00:29:02,789
"Principal
Investigator: Miranda..."

695
00:29:04,126 --> 00:29:06,259
It's yours now.

696
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:08,378
I have no pending
trials with the FDA.

697
00:29:14,402 --> 00:29:17,287
Ever since her surgery,
Zola's had weekly blood tests,

698
00:29:17,356 --> 00:29:18,855
and, the results I got today

699
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:21,508
were a little weird, so I
wanted to take a look at her.

700
00:29:21,577 --> 00:29:23,059
Yeah, and, you
know, with babies,

701
00:29:23,129 --> 00:29:24,856
I mean, when a doctor
calls... I got worried,

702
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,179
so I just rushed her right in,

703
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:28,448
and I must have left my
phone in the day-care center.

704
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:29,757
And your pager.

705
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:32,268
My pager I had to turn
in because they fired me.

706
00:29:33,121 --> 00:29:34,955
What's wrong with her?

707
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:38,692
Her white count was elevated.

708
00:29:38,761 --> 00:29:42,212
14.5. I wanted to make sure
there wasn't a post-op infection

709
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,747
or a CSF leak or something.

710
00:29:44,817 --> 00:29:46,616
On my exam, she looks fine.

711
00:29:46,685 --> 00:29:48,585
No signs of spinal shock.

712
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:52,071
I re-ran her CBC, and
her white count was eight.

713
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,290
Totally normal.

714
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:55,191
Must have just been
a stress reactant,

715
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:58,445
or a fluke in the labs,
'cause, well, she's fine.

716
00:30:06,205 --> 00:30:07,571
It's true.

717
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:11,041
CSF leaks are a problem
with spina bifida babies.

718
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:13,429
That's great you caught that.

719
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:33,279
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean for any of this...

720
00:30:33,348 --> 00:30:35,629
I didn't mean for
any of this to happen.

721
00:30:38,804 --> 00:30:40,470
I know. I know.

722
00:30:44,226 --> 00:30:45,466
I still don't understand

723
00:30:45,493 --> 00:30:47,689
what you possibly
could've been thinking.

724
00:30:47,713 --> 00:30:49,162
They fired me.

725
00:30:49,231 --> 00:30:51,965
Janet basically told me they
were gonna take Zola away.

726
00:30:52,033 --> 00:30:54,617
I mean, possibly send
her back to Malawi.

727
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:57,487
You and me.

728
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:02,158
I just needed some time.

729
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:04,761
I just needed to hold
her and look at her

730
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:08,131
and just think about
how everything,

731
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,168
everything got so screwed up.

732
00:31:14,689 --> 00:31:15,755
You should take Zola.

733
00:31:17,142 --> 00:31:19,075
Janet has a problem
with me, not with you.

734
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:20,627
And we need to
do whatever we can

735
00:31:20,696 --> 00:31:22,256
to make sure they
don't take her away,

736
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:24,609
and if that means that you
have custody of her and I don't,

737
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:26,633
well, then that's
what we need to do.

738
00:31:26,701 --> 00:31:28,285
You're not fired.

739
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:30,431
Richard's gonna
take the fall for you.

740
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:32,022
What?

741
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,718
He can't do that. I'm
not gonna let him do that.

742
00:31:33,742 --> 00:31:34,786
Yes, you will.

743
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:36,621
If you want to keep this baby,

744
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:38,965
you will let him protect you.

745
00:31:50,859 --> 00:31:52,125
Dan?

746
00:31:52,194 --> 00:31:54,094
Oh, my God. Sweetheart.

747
00:31:54,163 --> 00:31:55,579
Danny, I was scared.

748
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:56,996
Oh, I know.

749
00:31:57,065 --> 00:31:59,015
I didn't know where you were.

750
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,650
I'm right here.

751
00:32:00,719 --> 00:32:04,337
You were asleep, and they
didn't want me to wake you up.

752
00:32:04,406 --> 00:32:05,621
I fell down.

753
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:07,624
You sure did.

754
00:32:08,476 --> 00:32:09,993
You stayed, though.

755
00:32:10,062 --> 00:32:11,628
I'm not going anywhere.

756
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:12,729
Don't go anywhere.

757
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:14,038
I'm right here.

758
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:16,750
Oh, I love you so much.

759
00:32:29,014 --> 00:32:30,147
Ow!

760
00:32:30,215 --> 00:32:31,681
You're a big baby.

761
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:46,496
Okay.

762
00:32:46,565 --> 00:32:51,034
All right, the top row all got
the device on the first round.

763
00:32:51,103 --> 00:32:52,647
Dr. Webber tweaked the protocol

764
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:54,315
pretty substantially after that,

765
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:56,317
which means the second
set, that's these guys here,

766
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:59,593
they all tend to
do a lot better.

767
00:32:59,661 --> 00:33:01,773
I've been off the project
for the last couple of weeks,

768
00:33:01,797 --> 00:33:04,197
but I'm pretty sure I
remember the drill.

769
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:06,049
I can walk you through it.

770
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:09,302
It had to be mice.

771
00:33:13,308 --> 00:33:16,443
All right. Let's
take it from the top.

772
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:36,079
How's it looking? Can't tell.

773
00:33:36,131 --> 00:33:38,898
They can't just take the
baby away, can they?

774
00:33:38,967 --> 00:33:40,534
I don't know.

775
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:16,253
Meredith says
you didn't do it yet.

776
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,507
I didn't change my mind.

777
00:34:22,611 --> 00:34:24,711
I know.

778
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:27,113
I know. You don't
change your mind.

779
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:37,691
You'd cut off my leg
for me, wouldn't you?

780
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:43,808
Well, I wouldn't botch
it like that guy did.

781
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:46,444
I'd leave you a good stump
so you could get a prosthesis.

782
00:34:58,397 --> 00:35:00,163
When's the appointment?

783
00:35:06,722 --> 00:35:07,921
Now.

784
00:35:13,761 --> 00:35:14,894
Okay.

785
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,632
Okay.

786
00:35:23,237 --> 00:35:24,637
Let's go.

787
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:30,293
I... Oh, God.

788
00:35:45,928 --> 00:35:48,672
They're not gonna find a
better family than two doctors.

789
00:35:48,696 --> 00:35:50,496
It's gonna be fine.

790
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:52,131
Anybody want to
go check on Sofia?

791
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:54,017
Why?

792
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:57,987
'Cause when somebody's talking
about taking someone's baby away,

793
00:35:58,056 --> 00:35:59,296
you wanna see your baby.

794
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:01,390
Oh, you guys. She's fine.

795
00:36:03,629 --> 00:36:05,428
I'm right behind you.

796
00:36:13,305 --> 00:36:15,138
Maybe we should leave, too.

797
00:36:15,207 --> 00:36:16,618
I mean, I'm sure
they don't want us

798
00:36:16,642 --> 00:36:18,042
just sitting here
staring at them.

799
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,860
I don't know.

800
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:24,764
They're trying to keep a
family together. That's not easy.

801
00:36:24,833 --> 00:36:28,301
You know, it can't hurt to stick
around, make sure they're okay.

802
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:31,237
You see, this is why
you're the Gunther.

803
00:36:31,306 --> 00:36:33,472
I have terrible
leadership instincts.

804
00:36:35,043 --> 00:36:37,363
That doesn't make
me a better leader.

805
00:36:38,796 --> 00:36:41,516
A better person
maybe, but... Oh...

806
00:36:42,284 --> 00:36:45,735
<i>We are in a bit of
a bind right now.</i>

807
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:49,939
A lot of questions came up
today about your relationship,

808
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:51,607
about your employment...

809
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:53,721
Well, she got her job back.
That was a misunderstanding.

810
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:55,261
She disappeared.

811
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:57,191
Well, that was a
miscommunication.

812
00:36:57,215 --> 00:37:00,049
And the part about you two
living in separate houses,

813
00:37:00,118 --> 00:37:02,318
that's miscommunication, too?

814
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:05,021
Look, I get it.

815
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:08,091
It's not easy bringing a
child into a relationship.

816
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:11,244
You're allowed to have
some bumps in the road.

817
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:14,481
But this afternoon, when it
looked like you two had split up,

818
00:37:14,549 --> 00:37:16,582
your wife got fired,

819
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:19,618
she lied to me about it
and left with the baby.

820
00:37:19,687 --> 00:37:21,371
I set off some alarms.

821
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,625
Now I'm trying to dial them all
back, but it's not that easy to do.

822
00:37:25,693 --> 00:37:27,260
Once the system
is set in motion,

823
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:29,963
there's a certain protocol
that has to be followed.

824
00:37:30,031 --> 00:37:31,414
Once the agency believes that

825
00:37:31,483 --> 00:37:32,843
there are questions
about Meredith...

826
00:37:32,867 --> 00:37:36,380
Janet, Meredith is the best
mother a child could have.

827
00:37:36,404 --> 00:37:39,205
She loves Zola. She loves me.

828
00:37:39,274 --> 00:37:41,874
And if there is a
flaw with her, it's...

829
00:37:41,943 --> 00:37:44,205
She loves people so much
that she'll do anything for them.

830
00:37:44,229 --> 00:37:46,462
Derek, please.

831
00:37:47,532 --> 00:37:49,465
I hear you.

832
00:37:49,534 --> 00:37:51,334
But no matter what I say,

833
00:37:51,403 --> 00:37:55,705
social services still has to
reevaluate the placement.

834
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:59,225
And while that happens,
Zola can't be in your home.

835
00:38:04,398 --> 00:38:06,816
I'll give you a minute
to say goodbye.

836
00:38:15,844 --> 00:38:18,528
We should... We
should let her sleep.

837
00:38:19,564 --> 00:38:21,981
She's ours. Nobody's
taking her away.

838
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,000
And

839
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:27,804
she'll wake up in half
an hour, and then we'll

840
00:38:27,873 --> 00:38:29,706
take her home for dinner.

841
00:38:34,613 --> 00:38:35,823
Nah. We should wake her up.

842
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:36,980
Yeah.

843
00:38:39,017 --> 00:38:40,617
Hi, little baby.

844
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:42,018
Daddy's here.

845
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:43,086
Hi.

846
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,186
Daddy's here.

847
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:45,522
Hi, sweet girl.

848
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,856
Little goose.

849
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,770
Adele. Honey.

850
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:03,172
Yeah, I'm on my way home.

851
00:39:03,241 --> 00:39:05,708
No, I'm not working late.

852
00:39:05,777 --> 00:39:09,195
I told you, I'm having
dinner with you.

853
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:12,732
Yeah, well,

854
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,334
this time I mean it.

855
00:39:16,338 --> 00:39:17,737
Okay.

856
00:39:23,044 --> 00:39:25,222
I'm gonna give you an
injection to numb the cervix.

857
00:39:25,246 --> 00:39:28,013
If you'd like some IV diazepam,

858
00:39:28,082 --> 00:39:31,167
it won't knock you out,
but it'll calm you down.

859
00:39:33,088 --> 00:39:34,208
Okay.

860
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:38,757
I want to ask you one more time.

861
00:39:38,826 --> 00:39:41,961
Are you absolutely sure
this is what you want to do?

862
00:39:51,456 --> 00:39:52,889
Then let's get started.

863
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:25,054
Sorry, but it's time to go.

864
00:40:34,815 --> 00:40:36,282
Derek.

865
00:40:37,986 --> 00:40:39,285
Here you go.

866
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:40,670
Okay. Hey.

867
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:45,724
Janet is a very nice lady.

868
00:40:45,793 --> 00:40:46,893
We like her a lot.

869
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,278
Yeah.

870
00:40:49,347 --> 00:40:52,798
She's gonna find you a very nice
family to go stay with for a while.

871
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,800
And then you're gonna
come right back to us,

872
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,736
and everything's gonna be fine.

873
00:41:01,076 --> 00:41:02,641
Okay?

874
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:06,529
Okay.

875
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:14,270
She likes her bottle room
temperature, not too warm.

876
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:16,366
And she cannot sleep
without that giraffe.

877
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,385
It's in the front pocket
of the diaper bag.

878
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:20,204
And there's extra
pacifiers in there.

879
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:22,761
You're gonna need them
when you put her in the car.

880
00:41:40,765 --> 00:41:42,826
<i>You think that true
love is the only thing</i>

881
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:46,218
<i>that can crush your heart.</i>

882
00:41:46,287 --> 00:41:49,956
<i>The thing that will take
your life and light it up.</i>

883
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,079
<i>Or destroy it.</i>

884
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:03,252
<i>Then,</i>

885
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:09,725
<i>you become a mother.</i>
