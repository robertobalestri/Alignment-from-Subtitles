1
00:00:01,313 --> 00:00:02,922
- Previously on The Resident...
- We want to make you

2
00:00:02,924 --> 00:00:04,423
the director of our program,

3
00:00:04,425 --> 00:00:05,666
but we need to know by next week.

4
00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:08,335
- So, are you gonna take it?
- Is there anything left of us?

5
00:00:08,337 --> 00:00:09,911
You're the one who made it clear

6
00:00:09,913 --> 00:00:11,597
that not having kids
was a deal-breaker.

7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,323
Kit Voss offered me a job.

8
00:00:13,325 --> 00:00:15,250
Why would you leave Seattle Children's?

9
00:00:15,252 --> 00:00:16,843
So that I can be closer to you.

10
00:00:16,845 --> 00:00:19,496
You're a good man, Dr. Austin.

11
00:00:19,498 --> 00:00:21,832
I think our child should
witness that firsthand.

12
00:00:21,834 --> 00:00:23,684
- Our child?
- If you're still willing.

13
00:00:23,686 --> 00:00:25,185
I've gone and fallen for someone.

14
00:00:25,187 --> 00:00:26,928
You're afraid the guy's gonna say no?

15
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:28,447
Reinforcements are here to cheer you up.

16
00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:30,357
I'm as afraid he'll say yes as I am

17
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,911
- he'll say no.
- Go tell the man how you feel.

18
00:00:42,521 --> 00:00:43,870
Hope I'm not too early.

19
00:00:43,872 --> 00:00:45,355
Not at all. Come on in.

20
00:00:45,357 --> 00:00:46,781
- Beautiful evening.
- It is.

21
00:00:46,783 --> 00:00:49,284
I've been looking forward
to this for a long time.

22
00:00:49,286 --> 00:00:51,303
Thank you so much for
offering to babysit.

23
00:00:51,345 --> 00:00:53,995
Are you kidding? I'm so excited.

24
00:00:53,997 --> 00:00:55,255
I can't wait to meet Gigi.

25
00:00:55,257 --> 00:00:58,017
Well, she's asleep now, but, um,

26
00:00:58,019 --> 00:00:59,409
she'll be up in the
next couple of hours.

27
00:00:59,411 --> 00:01:00,761
And if we're not back by then...

28
00:01:00,763 --> 00:01:03,247
We're not gonna be back.
We're gonna live it up, Nic.

29
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:06,174
It's our first night
out since Gigi was born,

30
00:01:06,176 --> 00:01:08,101
so someone has a little
separation anxiety.

31
00:01:08,103 --> 00:01:10,696
You have nothing to worry about.

32
00:01:10,698 --> 00:01:11,864
I took CPR training for infants,

33
00:01:11,866 --> 00:01:13,348
and I have three younger siblings.

34
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,035
Emergency contacts, just in case.

35
00:01:19,356 --> 00:01:21,281
There's pumped breast
milk in the fridge.

36
00:01:21,283 --> 00:01:24,376
- We heat it up in the...
- The bottle warmer. I've got this.

37
00:01:24,378 --> 00:01:27,104
And I will test it just to
make sure it's not too hot.

38
00:01:27,106 --> 00:01:29,409
Great, and don't forget to
burp her and change her after.

39
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:30,410
Of course.

40
00:01:30,411 --> 00:01:31,958
I'm more worried about
Nic than I am Gigi.

41
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,218
I'm right here.

42
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,220
You're gonna be fine.

43
00:01:35,222 --> 00:01:37,447
Nice new jacket, Dr. Hawkins.

44
00:01:37,449 --> 00:01:39,374
Ah, you like? Thanks.

45
00:01:39,376 --> 00:01:41,802
Have a great time.

46
00:01:41,804 --> 00:01:44,304
Just call if there's anything, okay?

47
00:01:44,306 --> 00:01:45,789
Bye.

48
00:01:48,736 --> 00:01:50,736
Somebody has a little crush.

49
00:01:50,738 --> 00:01:52,220
Don't be ridiculous.

50
00:01:52,222 --> 00:01:54,073
"Nice new jacket, Dr. Hawkins."

51
00:01:54,075 --> 00:01:56,466
Mm.

The illustrious doctor
scientist graces us peons

59
00:02:29,259 --> 00:02:30,943
with his presence for the last time.

60
00:02:30,945 --> 00:02:33,353
Oh, come on. You know,
I think I liked it better

61
00:02:33,355 --> 00:02:36,097
when you just ignored me
when I showed up for my shift.

62
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:37,524
Better get into your scrubs.

63
00:02:37,526 --> 00:02:39,284
You're a bit too big for those britches.

64
00:02:39,286 --> 00:02:41,120
Poor guy's gonna hate Baltimore Hospital

65
00:02:41,122 --> 00:02:42,529
for Advanced Science.

66
00:02:42,531 --> 00:02:45,124
Do you know how cold
Baltimore gets in January?

67
00:02:45,126 --> 00:02:47,367
And he's a fragile flower.

68
00:02:47,369 --> 00:02:50,379
Oh, you don't fool me. I
know you're all crying inside.

69
00:02:51,132 --> 00:02:54,133
I'm gonna miss you, a lot.

70
00:02:56,453 --> 00:02:59,196
We're well aware what
this exit is about,

71
00:02:59,198 --> 00:03:00,472
and it ain't science, or money,

72
00:03:00,474 --> 00:03:03,142
because Dr. Voss would match any offer.

73
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,886
Talk to Leela.

74
00:03:05,888 --> 00:03:06,961
Fix this.

75
00:03:06,963 --> 00:03:09,148
I wish I could.

76
00:03:10,225 --> 00:03:12,467
Help! We need help over here, please.

77
00:03:12,469 --> 00:03:13,986
Can't... breathe.

78
00:03:13,988 --> 00:03:16,280
All right, this way.

79
00:03:18,993 --> 00:03:20,400
What's going on?

80
00:03:20,402 --> 00:03:22,386
She-she was a little
short of breath last night.

81
00:03:22,388 --> 00:03:24,663
We thought it was the
baby pressing on her lungs,

82
00:03:24,665 --> 00:03:26,056
but she woke up like this.

83
00:03:26,058 --> 00:03:28,316
- How far along is she?
- Five months.

84
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:29,835
Mommy, are you gonna be okay?

85
00:03:29,837 --> 00:03:31,336
Of course, baby.

86
00:03:32,915 --> 00:03:35,657
Hypoxemic. Elevated respiratory rate.

87
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:37,325
Rales up to the mid chest.

88
00:03:37,327 --> 00:03:38,919
Sounds like pulmonary edema.

89
00:03:38,921 --> 00:03:40,179
Let's get an EKG and get her on O2.

90
00:03:40,181 --> 00:03:41,829
- Mommy?
- It's okay.

91
00:03:41,831 --> 00:03:42,906
Can someone... take him?

92
00:03:42,908 --> 00:03:45,184
I'll call Winston in social services.

93
00:03:45,186 --> 00:03:47,186
He'll get someone to look after him.

94
00:03:47,188 --> 00:03:49,188
Come with me, sweetheart.

95
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:54,434
Fetal heart rate sounds good.

96
00:03:54,436 --> 00:03:55,919
Obvious movement.

97
00:03:55,921 --> 00:03:58,012
The baby looks good.

98
00:03:59,925 --> 00:04:02,850
- Praise God.
- Thank you.

99
00:04:06,448 --> 00:04:08,782
Let's get a stat chest X-ray.

100
00:04:08,784 --> 00:04:09,899
Page Dr. Austin.

101
00:04:10,619 --> 00:04:13,027
What's wrong? What's happening?

102
00:04:16,124 --> 00:04:18,608
Devon always kept the keys
in a bowl in the hallway.

103
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,369
Thank you so much for reminding me.

104
00:04:21,371 --> 00:04:22,446
I'm sorry.

105
00:04:22,448 --> 00:04:24,114
I just really want to get going.

106
00:04:24,116 --> 00:04:25,707
I can't wait for the ultrasound.

107
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:28,301
Although I already know I'm
pregnant because I can feel it.

108
00:04:28,303 --> 00:04:29,970
My stomach is doing flip-flops.

109
00:04:29,972 --> 00:04:32,973
And guess what, I woke
up nauseous this morning.

110
00:04:32,975 --> 00:04:34,808
I told you to not have
that pizza last night.

111
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,885
It's not the pizza, Leela. I feel...

112
00:04:37,887 --> 00:04:39,796
- different, you know?
- Well, actually,

113
00:04:39,798 --> 00:04:43,951
since I've never been
pregnant, no, I don't know.

114
00:04:52,736 --> 00:04:55,045
Today's his last day, isn't it?

115
00:05:04,156 --> 00:05:06,673
You guys broke up way too fast.

116
00:05:06,675 --> 00:05:08,325
It's a pattern with you.

117
00:05:08,327 --> 00:05:10,494
You're kind of a
relationship wrecking ball.

118
00:05:10,496 --> 00:05:12,920
Oh, come on. Do you remember
when you dumped Rick Stamos

119
00:05:12,922 --> 00:05:15,089
right before prom?

120
00:05:15,091 --> 00:05:17,109
He was ripped and a quarterback,

121
00:05:17,111 --> 00:05:18,610
and you had a killer dress.

122
00:05:18,612 --> 00:05:21,947
- I caught him making out with a cheerleader.
- Hmm.

123
00:05:23,675 --> 00:05:25,692
He can't wait to go.

124
00:05:25,694 --> 00:05:26,934
He's leaving Atlanta tomorrow.

125
00:05:26,936 --> 00:05:28,361
He's only sticking around

126
00:05:28,363 --> 00:05:30,289
for Kit and Bell's
engagement party tonight.

127
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,365
I know he still loves you. Okay?

128
00:05:32,367 --> 00:05:35,627
Everyone knows he still loves you.

129
00:05:37,517 --> 00:05:41,444
And sometimes you can't always see

130
00:05:41,446 --> 00:05:43,113
what's right before your eyes.

131
00:05:43,115 --> 00:05:45,207
There is still time.

132
00:05:52,608 --> 00:05:55,275
Dr. Sullivan, where's your walker?

133
00:05:55,277 --> 00:05:56,568
I know you're feeling better,

134
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,035
but you shouldn't be on your feet alone.

135
00:05:58,037 --> 00:06:01,038
I am discharging myself
from the hospital.

136
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,617
- You... you can't do that.
- Yes, I can.

137
00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:04,801
I'm a doctor.

138
00:06:04,803 --> 00:06:06,786
You can't be your own doctor.

139
00:06:06,788 --> 00:06:08,397
I know my own body, and I feel fine.

140
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:09,973
Besides, work is the best medicine.

141
00:06:09,975 --> 00:06:12,292
If you're your own doctor,
does that also make you

142
00:06:12,294 --> 00:06:13,960
your own worst patient?

143
00:06:13,962 --> 00:06:16,071
- Ha ha.
- You only got shot three times.

144
00:06:16,073 --> 00:06:18,131
Why don't you go run a
10K while you're at it?

145
00:06:18,133 --> 00:06:21,468
You know what? You are just
the person I was looking for.

146
00:06:23,396 --> 00:06:27,582
Look what you left in my
room on your last visit.

147
00:06:29,661 --> 00:06:31,661
Mr. Giraffe!

148
00:06:31,663 --> 00:06:35,982
He must have been scared in
that dark drawer all by himself.

149
00:06:35,984 --> 00:06:38,576
No, not in the least, he was sleeping.

150
00:06:38,578 --> 00:06:40,929
He's a sleepyhead, but
he did poke his head out

151
00:06:40,931 --> 00:06:43,657
- to ask for some leaves for dinner.
- Silly.

152
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:47,436
He doesn't eat leaves, he
eats chocolate ice cream.

153
00:06:47,438 --> 00:06:49,771
Oh, right.

154
00:06:50,774 --> 00:06:53,942
I'll drop Gigi at preschool
and meet you in your dad's room.

155
00:06:54,611 --> 00:06:56,236
His lab results are in.

156
00:07:05,681 --> 00:07:07,347
How are you feeling, Dad?

157
00:07:07,349 --> 00:07:09,032
Fine.

158
00:07:09,034 --> 00:07:10,942
No lingering symptoms?

159
00:07:10,944 --> 00:07:15,464
It's been a day and a
half since my little fall.

160
00:07:15,466 --> 00:07:16,798
I'm much better.

161
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,859
Well, it was more than
just a fall. You passed out.

162
00:07:19,861 --> 00:07:21,285
Why are you getting dressed?

163
00:07:21,287 --> 00:07:24,881
- I'm discharging myself.
- You...

164
00:07:24,883 --> 00:07:26,533
You can't be your own doctor.

165
00:07:26,535 --> 00:07:27,550
Oh, wow.

166
00:07:27,552 --> 00:07:29,794
The apple fell directly under the tree.

167
00:07:29,796 --> 00:07:33,464
My father and I are both doctors
who also happen to be patients.

168
00:07:33,466 --> 00:07:35,542
Other than that, we are nothing alike.

169
00:07:35,544 --> 00:07:37,802
Of course you're not. Your labs.

170
00:07:37,804 --> 00:07:40,547
You're profoundly anemic.

171
00:07:40,549 --> 00:07:43,233
Your stomach pain is
getting worse, right?

172
00:07:43,235 --> 00:07:45,051
Combine that with your collapse...

173
00:07:45,053 --> 00:07:46,978
Bleeding ulcer is top of the list.

174
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,814
Ridiculous. No acid
reflux. No indigestion.

175
00:07:49,816 --> 00:07:52,408
- Any blood in your stool?
- Okay.

176
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:55,912
Before we discuss my bowel
movements in greater detail,

177
00:07:55,914 --> 00:07:58,398
can we clarify...

178
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,092
which of you is my actual doctor?

179
00:08:04,998 --> 00:08:07,349
You need more tests.

180
00:08:07,351 --> 00:08:08,683
There may be a simple explanation

181
00:08:08,685 --> 00:08:10,093
for what's going on here,

182
00:08:10,095 --> 00:08:13,522
but until we find it,
you aren't going anywhere.

183
00:08:25,168 --> 00:08:27,035
Your vision is fine, Randolph.

184
00:08:27,037 --> 00:08:29,596
You had an MS flare.

185
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:31,689
Okay. Well, yeah, it was kind of rough.

186
00:08:31,691 --> 00:08:34,525
They're not unexpected,
especially near the optic nerve.

187
00:08:34,527 --> 00:08:36,603
With an extra pulse of steroids,
you'll be back to normal.

188
00:08:36,605 --> 00:08:38,605
This should be nothing to worry about.

189
00:08:38,607 --> 00:08:40,549
See? It's great news.

190
00:08:40,551 --> 00:08:42,458
You're good to go back in the OR.

191
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,261
I'm clearing you for surgery.

192
00:08:46,114 --> 00:08:47,389
Great.

193
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,449
I know that look. Talk to me.

194
00:08:56,544 --> 00:09:00,121
Every MS flare feels like
it's the beginning of the end.

195
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:02,140
The pain is excruciating,
and you're afraid

196
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:04,458
it's getting worse, but
you're catastrophizing.

197
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,628
- You heard the doctor.
- It is progressive.

198
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,222
Not necessarily.

199
00:09:09,224 --> 00:09:11,316
You could go into total remission.

200
00:09:12,394 --> 00:09:14,653
I love your optimism.

201
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:17,822
I'm about to marry
Chastain's finest surgeon,

202
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:21,718
who will hold that
title for years to come.

203
00:09:22,904 --> 00:09:26,313
Please, tell me whatever is happening

204
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,500
isn't going to... harm my baby.

205
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:31,586
Right now, let's focus
on you, Mom, all right?

206
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:33,821
Your echocardiogram is showing

207
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,232
that your heart isn't
pumping strong enough

208
00:09:36,234 --> 00:09:38,259
to support you and the baby.

209
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:41,587
W-what does that mean?

210
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:44,182
It means that your wife
is in heart failure.

211
00:09:45,206 --> 00:09:47,707
No, how-how can this be happening?

212
00:09:47,709 --> 00:09:49,300
Have you had any health issues recently?

213
00:09:49,302 --> 00:09:50,893
Flu... a few weeks ago.

214
00:09:51,295 --> 00:09:53,321
I-it was pretty bad,

215
00:09:53,323 --> 00:09:56,991
but she finally got better.

216
00:09:56,993 --> 00:09:58,067
Help me!

217
00:09:58,069 --> 00:10:00,161
Step aside, please. It's okay.

218
00:10:00,163 --> 00:10:02,071
Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.

219
00:10:02,163 --> 00:10:03,663
Pulmonary edema is worsening,

220
00:10:03,665 --> 00:10:05,256
which means her heart function is, too.

221
00:10:05,258 --> 00:10:07,667
Pressure's dropping.
Hanging a norepi drip.

222
00:10:07,669 --> 00:10:09,260
We're having a baby girl.

223
00:10:09,262 --> 00:10:11,671
We've hoped for one
since Miguel was born.

224
00:10:11,673 --> 00:10:13,005
We-we cannot lose this baby.

225
00:10:13,007 --> 00:10:14,081
She's decompensating fast.

226
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,249
We need to intubate now.

227
00:10:15,251 --> 00:10:16,935
Come here.

228
00:10:18,254 --> 00:10:20,254
We are trying to save your wife's life.

229
00:10:20,256 --> 00:10:23,816
Let us work so can
save both mom and baby.

230
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:26,819
Okay.

231
00:10:40,435 --> 00:10:41,519
Nic.

232
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,704
I forgot to tell Marion to leave
the night-light on in Gigi's room.

233
00:10:44,706 --> 00:10:46,189
I left it on.

234
00:10:46,281 --> 00:10:50,558
How about we put all phones
away just for the next hour?

235
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,210
Well, your new girlfriend

236
00:10:53,212 --> 00:10:54,804
has to be able to reach me.

237
00:10:54,806 --> 00:10:56,547
Oh, she's on my speed dial.

238
00:10:56,549 --> 00:10:58,457
How convenient.

239
00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:01,477
- ♪ The sun goes down on my side of town... ♪
- Wow.

240
00:11:01,479 --> 00:11:04,388
"Neon Moon."

241
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,240
Same song that was playing
right here on our first date.

242
00:11:06,242 --> 00:11:08,968
You don't remember what song
was playing on our first date.

243
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:11,596
I do. It was "Neon Moon."

244
00:11:11,598 --> 00:11:15,232
- It's always playing on a jukebox somewhere.
- Hmm.

245
00:11:15,834 --> 00:11:19,236
How about we go right to the
dancing part of the evening?

246
00:11:20,665 --> 00:11:25,167

253
00:11:51,287 --> 00:11:52,454
Yes.

254
00:11:52,956 --> 00:11:55,272
The mom is critical, but
the dad is calmer now.

255
00:11:55,274 --> 00:11:56,849
He wants his son with him.

256
00:11:56,851 --> 00:11:58,292
- Okay.
- Come on, sweetie.

257
00:11:58,294 --> 00:12:00,670
Let's go see your daddy.

258
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,449
Winston.

259
00:12:05,451 --> 00:12:06,692
Dr. Hawkins.

260
00:12:06,694 --> 00:12:08,043
Yeah. Do you have a minute?

261
00:12:08,045 --> 00:12:11,305
I have two minutes. Walk
with me back to my office.

262
00:12:11,307 --> 00:12:12,789
What's going on?

263
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,642
I have a personal question for you.

264
00:12:15,952 --> 00:12:18,677
- Hope you don't mind me asking.
- No, go on.

265
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:20,679
Well, you know I lost my wife.

266
00:12:20,681 --> 00:12:22,515
Yes. I'm so sorry.

267
00:12:22,517 --> 00:12:25,776
Devon told me you lost someone, too.

268
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:27,944
A partner who died suddenly.

269
00:12:27,946 --> 00:12:30,614
Yeah, we were together almost 20 years.

270
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:33,500
He had a heart attack.
Was totally unexpected.

271
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,377
So you know about grief.

272
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:38,121
I do. It was overwhelming.

273
00:12:38,123 --> 00:12:39,557
How did you cope?

274
00:12:42,312 --> 00:12:44,887
For a while, quite badly.

275
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,150
I almost let what I'd lost destroy me.

276
00:12:49,152 --> 00:12:53,470
But eventually I realized
I had one life to live,

277
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:56,657
and I wanted it to mean something.

278
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,218
I have my daughter, and that saved me.

279
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,495
But no matter what I do,
for the last four years,

280
00:13:01,497 --> 00:13:03,055
I just can't let Nic go.

281
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,626
I keep remembering this
one specific evening.

282
00:13:09,897 --> 00:13:12,081
First date after we had Gigi.

283
00:13:12,991 --> 00:13:15,234
Maybe you shouldn't
fight these memories.

284
00:13:15,236 --> 00:13:16,802
Maybe they're trying
to tell you something.

285
00:13:17,847 --> 00:13:20,573
The past never goes away.

286
00:13:20,575 --> 00:13:22,683
If you don't deny it,

287
00:13:22,685 --> 00:13:25,269
you can learn from it.

288
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,648
Mr. Alvarez.

289
00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:35,863
How's my wife?

290
00:13:35,865 --> 00:13:38,014
We managed to stabilize her.

291
00:13:38,016 --> 00:13:40,593
Thank God.

292
00:13:40,595 --> 00:13:42,352
And thank you both.

293
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:43,929
Her heart was damaged,

294
00:13:43,931 --> 00:13:45,116
likely from the flu she had recently.

295
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:48,358
What she has is post-viral myocarditis.

296
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,213
Her pregnancy makes this
even more life-threatening.

297
00:13:52,215 --> 00:13:56,509
Her heart isn't strong
enough now to beat for two.

298
00:13:57,445 --> 00:13:58,944
We're so sorry to say this,

299
00:13:58,946 --> 00:14:02,615
but the only safe
option for Trini is to...

300
00:14:02,617 --> 00:14:04,141
is to end the pregnancy.

301
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:08,120
What?

302
00:14:08,122 --> 00:14:09,379
N-no.

303
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:10,898
No, that-that's impossible.

304
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,143
Y-you're talking
about killing the baby.

305
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:15,552
That would be murder.

306
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:17,387
We can't deliver the
baby at five months.

307
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:18,864
It's not viable.

308
00:14:19,951 --> 00:14:22,484
We understand your pain is enormous.

309
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:26,872
But we believe your wife will
not survive if we don't do this.

310
00:14:28,142 --> 00:14:31,644
Mr. Alvarez, your son
will lose his mother.

311
00:14:31,646 --> 00:14:32,753
Honestly, it's not a choice.

312
00:14:32,755 --> 00:14:34,647
We can only save one life.

313
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:35,906
- Hers.
- No.

314
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:37,741
I-I will not accept this.

315
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:39,075
There has to be another way.

316
00:14:39,077 --> 00:14:40,261
There is no safe way.

317
00:14:40,263 --> 00:14:42,430
Please, there has to be!

318
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:49,419
Dr. Voss, we have a problem.

319
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:52,665
We have a patient who has
to terminate her pregnancy

320
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:54,166
to save her own life.

321
00:14:54,168 --> 00:14:55,344
Her heart is failing.

322
00:14:55,345 --> 00:14:57,019
- God, how awful.
- The husband is certain

323
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:00,172
there's more we can do
to save both mom and baby.

324
00:15:00,174 --> 00:15:01,598
And is there?

325
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,784
All we can offer is an
incredible long shot,

326
00:15:03,786 --> 00:15:05,143
almost certain to fail.

327
00:15:05,145 --> 00:15:06,603
And what does the patient want to do?

328
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:08,605
She can't make the
decision. She's intubated.

329
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:10,699
Her husband is her health care proxy.

330
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:11,959
So the real question is,

331
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:14,186
do we even suggest this alternative

332
00:15:14,188 --> 00:15:16,279
that we think is far too dangerous?

333
00:15:16,281 --> 00:15:17,923
Oh, this is a tough one.

334
00:15:19,193 --> 00:15:22,194
But if he won't agree
to end the pregnancy

335
00:15:22,196 --> 00:15:24,763
to save her life, you have no choice.

336
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:29,310
Just make the consequences
of your plan crystal clear

337
00:15:29,312 --> 00:15:32,538
so he knows the risks he's taking.

338
00:15:44,218 --> 00:15:47,236
Dad, do not move. You know better.

339
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:49,163
I have an itch.

340
00:15:49,165 --> 00:15:51,314
We're almost done.

341
00:15:51,316 --> 00:15:52,941
I don't want him to be sick,

342
00:15:52,943 --> 00:15:54,560
but please tell me he can go home.

343
00:15:54,562 --> 00:15:58,580
Let's figure out what's
wrong with him first,

344
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,591
then plan next steps.

345
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,146
I'm so sorry.

346
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:19,109
He has pancreatic cancer.

347
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:27,618
I'm a doctor, a good one.

348
00:16:28,763 --> 00:16:30,579
And I had no clue.

349
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:34,283
Well, that's not unexpected, Dad.

350
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:38,361
Pancreatic cancer, it can often be
asymptomatic until it's too late.

351
00:16:38,363 --> 00:16:39,713
Okay, thank you for clarifying.

352
00:16:39,715 --> 00:16:41,607
I must have skipped the part

353
00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:44,093
about pancreatic cancer
at medical school.

354
00:16:45,613 --> 00:16:46,870
I'm just trying to help.

355
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:48,222
Well, you can't help.

356
00:16:50,059 --> 00:16:52,851
Look, I've just been
handed a death sentence.

357
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:59,567
All right, how long?

358
00:16:59,569 --> 00:17:01,627
How long do I have?

359
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:05,573
Pancreatic cancer is
a terrifying diagnosis.

360
00:17:05,575 --> 00:17:07,316
For most,

361
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:10,469
five-year survival rate
is less than ten percent,

362
00:17:10,471 --> 00:17:12,471
but your odds are different.

363
00:17:12,473 --> 00:17:14,248
Look at the scans again.

364
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:23,090
The tumor appears...

365
00:17:23,092 --> 00:17:25,617
localized at the head of the pancreas.

366
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:27,836
Yes, which means it's operable.

367
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:32,082
Now, five-year survival rate
goes up dramatically to 25%.

368
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:34,159
A cure is possible?

369
00:17:34,161 --> 00:17:36,252
It is. Yes.

370
00:17:36,424 --> 00:17:37,682
Cade, you hear that?

371
00:17:37,684 --> 00:17:40,110
If the cancer hasn't spread.

372
00:17:40,112 --> 00:17:43,596
- You need a complicated procedure.
- The Whipple.

373
00:17:43,598 --> 00:17:46,842
We have a world-renowned
surgeon right here at Chastain.

374
00:17:46,844 --> 00:17:48,343
He's performed the
Whipple hundreds of times.

375
00:17:48,345 --> 00:17:49,769
Dr. Randolph Bell.

376
00:17:49,771 --> 00:17:51,437
Still a dangerous surgery

377
00:17:51,439 --> 00:17:53,957
that could have serious
complications, but...

378
00:17:53,959 --> 00:17:57,377
Okay, can you please stop
measuring me for a coffin?

379
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,706
Let's just be positive for one minute.

380
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:02,966
Is it too much to ask?

381
00:18:02,968 --> 00:18:06,261
Dr. Hawkins just said
I can survive this.

382
00:18:07,247 --> 00:18:09,047
Since it's obvious I'm not helping,

383
00:18:09,049 --> 00:18:11,266
I'm going to step out now.

384
00:18:18,651 --> 00:18:21,860
You know, if anyone can
survive this, you can.

385
00:18:26,808 --> 00:18:28,550
Well, that went well.

386
00:18:32,222 --> 00:18:35,916
You're under unimaginable stress.

387
00:18:37,077 --> 00:18:39,895
But...

388
00:18:39,897 --> 00:18:41,229
I think you need to recognize

389
00:18:41,231 --> 00:18:43,799
that this is hard for
your daughter also.

390
00:18:55,670 --> 00:19:00,098
Can you take the young man out to
the waiting room for a few minutes?

391
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,507
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

392
00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:03,843
- No problem.
- Thank you.

393
00:19:03,845 --> 00:19:07,698
Mr. Alvarez, we still
recommend you end the pregnancy,

394
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:12,202
today if possible. It is by
far the best chance for Trini.

395
00:19:12,204 --> 00:19:16,039
Although there is another
option that we can try.

396
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:17,374
What is this option?

397
00:19:17,376 --> 00:19:22,212
Well, we could put Trini
on a machine called an ECMO.

398
00:19:22,214 --> 00:19:24,882
It would ease the stress
of her struggling heart,

399
00:19:24,884 --> 00:19:28,276
and it might perhaps buy us some time

400
00:19:28,278 --> 00:19:29,887
and keep her alive for a few more months

401
00:19:29,889 --> 00:19:31,889
until she can deliver the baby safely.

402
00:19:31,891 --> 00:19:34,282
That sounds perfect.

403
00:19:34,284 --> 00:19:37,394
- Do it.
- No, it is far from perfect.

404
00:19:37,396 --> 00:19:39,579
You have to understand
that ECMO is very dangerous.

405
00:19:39,581 --> 00:19:42,715
There can be complications
like hemorrhage, stroke,

406
00:19:42,717 --> 00:19:45,810
- infection.
- Brain damage is possible.

407
00:19:45,812 --> 00:19:48,071
She could wind up paralyzed.

408
00:19:48,073 --> 00:19:49,631
Unable to speak. Blind.

409
00:19:49,633 --> 00:19:52,484
And she could die from
any of these complications.

410
00:19:52,486 --> 00:19:54,653
Then the baby would die as well.

411
00:19:54,655 --> 00:19:56,471
But there's a chance

412
00:19:56,473 --> 00:19:59,141
that Trini and the baby could
both be fine with this ECMO?

413
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:02,340
That is a remote
possibility, Mr. Alvarez.

414
00:20:02,342 --> 00:20:04,342
So, let's be clear, you are giving up

415
00:20:04,344 --> 00:20:06,678
the absolute best chance that we have

416
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,438
of saving your wife's life.

417
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,332
Listen.

418
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,016
If we end the pregnancy now,

419
00:20:12,018 --> 00:20:15,946
down the road, she can
safely have another child.

420
00:20:26,441 --> 00:20:29,017
My heart tells me that
you can save them both,

421
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:32,504
and I believe that Trini
would want you to try.

422
00:20:34,207 --> 00:20:35,632
Please.

423
00:20:55,061 --> 00:20:57,803
Why does he lash out at me?

424
00:20:57,805 --> 00:21:00,031
He's scared.

425
00:21:02,402 --> 00:21:05,495
Obviously, things have
not been easy between you.

426
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:09,815
But now is the time for
patience and understanding.

427
00:21:09,817 --> 00:21:11,559
Of course.

428
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:12,945
I love him.

429
00:21:13,747 --> 00:21:15,246
Despite the fact that I can't remember

430
00:21:15,248 --> 00:21:17,990
the last time he said he loved me.

431
00:21:17,992 --> 00:21:20,010
When I was little,

432
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:23,996
all the other kids thought
I had the coolest dad.

433
00:21:23,998 --> 00:21:25,665
Charmed them all.

434
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:27,425
Bought them all ice cream.

435
00:21:27,427 --> 00:21:31,079
Entertained them at my birthday parties.

436
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,764
It took a while to realize that he lives

437
00:21:32,766 --> 00:21:36,251
for the reflection he sees of
himself in other people's eyes,

438
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,420
and I see him too clearly.

439
00:21:39,272 --> 00:21:41,423
Forgiveness and acceptance
is a beautiful thing.

440
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,942
I didn't even talk to
my father for years.

441
00:21:43,944 --> 00:21:47,353
I realized our problems
were a two-way street.

442
00:21:47,355 --> 00:21:49,372
I wasn't as blameless as I thought.

443
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:51,524
So...

444
00:21:51,526 --> 00:21:54,694
I gave him a chance,
and he was capable of

445
00:21:54,696 --> 00:21:56,696
more than I ever could've imagined.

446
00:21:56,698 --> 00:21:59,174
Now we couldn't be closer.

447
00:22:03,204 --> 00:22:05,296
You only get one father.

448
00:22:05,298 --> 00:22:07,933
You can't change him,
and you may lose him.

449
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:11,561
Now's the time to accept him as he is.

450
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:18,026

She isn't. She's with her girlfriends.

468
00:23:17,697 --> 00:23:19,789
It's her birthday.

469
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:21,365
And her husband's in the hospital

470
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:24,035

471
00:23:24,037 --> 00:23:25,536

00:23:29,134 --> 00:23:31,634
She'll go back in a few hours.

Leela, I start at Baltimore
Advanced Sciences on Monday.

503
00:25:50,861 --> 00:25:52,861
I want to try again.

504
00:25:52,863 --> 00:25:54,505
I'm not happy.

505
00:25:55,291 --> 00:25:56,883
You're not happy.

00:26:02,873 --> 00:26:05,057
Yeah, I miss you a lot.

509
00:26:06,728 --> 00:26:08,543
But nothing's changed, has it?

510
00:26:08,545 --> 00:26:10,788
Actually, something has changed.

511
00:26:14,961 --> 00:26:18,295
This is my patient on
ECMO. She's desatting.

512
00:26:18,297 --> 00:26:20,631
I want to talk to you about
this, but I have to go, okay?

513
00:26:20,633 --> 00:26:22,724
Promise me we'll talk later.

514
00:26:22,726 --> 00:26:25,661
I have a big surgery, but
if you're still here...

515
00:26:27,323 --> 00:26:29,832
If not, I'll see you
at the engagement party.

516
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:43,654
Her pressure spiked just
as her heart rate dropped.

517
00:26:43,656 --> 00:26:45,765
Cushing's reflex.
Classic sign of stroke.

518
00:26:45,767 --> 00:26:48,659
It happened faster than we imagined.

519
00:26:48,661 --> 00:26:49,977
I'm going to adjust her arterial support

520
00:26:49,979 --> 00:26:52,346
to get her blood pressure
in a tighter range.

521
00:26:52,348 --> 00:26:54,106
It might be too late.

522
00:26:54,108 --> 00:26:56,776

523
00:26:56,778 --> 00:26:58,653

525
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,786
Here's the problem.

526
00:27:06,788 --> 00:27:09,288
Bleed, left side of the brain.

527
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:13,350
- Hemorrhagic stroke?
- Mm-hmm. Definitely.

528
00:27:13,352 --> 00:27:14,961
Damage may be extensive.

529
00:27:14,963 --> 00:27:16,445
Potentially paralyzed.

530
00:27:16,447 --> 00:27:19,614
I mean, she may have lost
the ability to speak forever.

531
00:27:19,616 --> 00:27:21,358
And worse still, this
could just be the beginning.

532
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,136
I see more possible
bleeds near the dura.

533
00:27:24,138 --> 00:27:25,546
I mean, this could have been avoided.

534
00:27:25,548 --> 00:27:27,456
Did you make her husband understand

535
00:27:27,458 --> 00:27:28,623
this was likely to happen?

536
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:30,125
Come on, man, don't you think we tried?

537
00:27:30,127 --> 00:27:32,478
We advised against it
in the strongest terms,

538
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,962
but he is her health care proxy.

539
00:27:33,964 --> 00:27:36,915
And we had no idea that she would
have complications this fast.

540
00:27:36,916 --> 00:27:40,469
Look, all we can do now is double
down on trying to save Trini,

541
00:27:40,471 --> 00:27:41,988
no matter what condition she's in,

542
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:44,490
and hope we can keep
her on ECMO long enough

543
00:27:44,492 --> 00:27:46,641
for her heart to recover

544
00:27:46,643 --> 00:27:50,329
or for the baby to mature
enough to be viable.

545
00:27:59,882 --> 00:28:01,782
Can you guys give us a minute?

546
00:28:10,835 --> 00:28:15,487
Look, I am perfectly aware
of the risks of this surgery,

547
00:28:15,489 --> 00:28:21,235
so I know that I may not
get off that OR table.

548
00:28:21,237 --> 00:28:23,971
You got the best of me.

549
00:28:25,165 --> 00:28:27,574
And none of the bad.

550
00:28:27,576 --> 00:28:32,104
I am so proud of you,
and I always have been.

551
00:28:34,174 --> 00:28:38,485
You are the child of my heart...

552
00:28:39,939 --> 00:28:42,272
... and if I haven't said it enough,

553
00:28:42,274 --> 00:28:44,742
then I need to say it now.

554
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,020
I love you.

555
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,877
All right.

556
00:28:54,879 --> 00:28:58,505
Now go back to being a tough
bastard and beat this thing.

557
00:28:59,533 --> 00:29:01,550
You got it.

558
00:29:19,219 --> 00:29:21,386
Hi, baby.

559
00:29:23,908 --> 00:29:26,533
Aw. Hi.

560
00:29:51,435 --> 00:29:54,436
- Update me.
- We troubleshot everything,

561
00:29:54,438 --> 00:29:55,980
but as you can see...

562
00:29:58,501 --> 00:29:59,608
Her heart's giving out.

563
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:02,278
She has a few minutes left, maybe.

564
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,779
Excuse me, excuse me. What's going on?

565
00:30:03,781 --> 00:30:05,839
What's happening to Trini?

566
00:30:05,841 --> 00:30:09,243
Mr. Alvarez, I am terribly sorry...

567
00:30:11,122 --> 00:30:12,863
... but your wife is dying.

568
00:30:12,865 --> 00:30:15,032
Just keep her on the machine, right?

569
00:30:15,034 --> 00:30:17,808
You said that it would
take over for her heart.

570
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:19,353
- Let it keep working.
- We can't.

571
00:30:19,355 --> 00:30:21,780
Her heart is too badly damaged.

572
00:30:21,782 --> 00:30:23,615
We tried to tell you
this was a long shot.

573
00:30:23,617 --> 00:30:24,949
It didn't work. I'm so sorry.

574
00:30:24,951 --> 00:30:27,377
No. Please.

575
00:30:27,379 --> 00:30:28,879
No.

576
00:30:28,881 --> 00:30:31,098
Mommy?

577
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,477
Do something! Please do something!

578
00:30:35,479 --> 00:30:36,703
Please.

579
00:30:36,705 --> 00:30:38,463
There's nothing more we can do.

580
00:30:38,465 --> 00:30:40,541
We can't bring her back.

581
00:30:40,543 --> 00:30:42,392
She's gone, Matias.

582
00:30:42,394 --> 00:30:44,611
No.

583
00:30:51,887 --> 00:30:55,572
Don't tell me that. Don't tell me that.

584
00:31:11,757 --> 00:31:13,515
And with that,

585
00:31:13,517 --> 00:31:15,851
we dissect the pancreas.

586
00:31:15,853 --> 00:31:20,171
Pancreas is mobilized.

587
00:31:20,173 --> 00:31:23,675
Oh, wait. W...

588
00:31:23,677 --> 00:31:25,435
What's the update?

589
00:31:25,437 --> 00:31:26,937
Well,

590
00:31:26,939 --> 00:31:30,157
looks like the tumor
has adhered to the IVC.

591
00:31:32,036 --> 00:31:33,852
Which means they have to resect it.

592
00:31:33,854 --> 00:31:36,705
- If they nick the IVC...
- That's not gonna happen.

593
00:31:36,707 --> 00:31:39,600
Bell's done this thousands of times.

594
00:31:39,802 --> 00:31:42,152
Dr. Devi...

595
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,562
- ... all yours.
- What is he doing?

596
00:31:44,564 --> 00:31:46,473
He can't pass this off to a resident.

597
00:31:46,475 --> 00:31:49,810
- Leela has never done a Whipple.
- Which is why she has to learn.

598
00:31:49,812 --> 00:31:51,828
Bell's there to back her up.

599
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,589
Satinsky clamp, 3.0 Prolene,

600
00:31:53,591 --> 00:31:55,239
sponge stick and forceps.

601
00:31:55,241 --> 00:31:57,426
Dr. Chu, do you have
Rh null blood up there?

602
00:31:57,428 --> 00:31:58,670
- I do.
- Hang it, please.

603
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:02,339
We're in for some turbulence. Clamp on.

604
00:32:02,341 --> 00:32:04,433
Dissecting the tumor off now.

605
00:32:05,994 --> 00:32:08,419
Blood pressure's in the toilet.

606
00:32:08,421 --> 00:32:09,996
Going up on pressors.

607
00:32:09,998 --> 00:32:12,349
Okay, Dr. Devi has
finished the dissection.

608
00:32:12,351 --> 00:32:14,000
She anticipated this.

609
00:32:14,002 --> 00:32:16,594
I've identified the defect,
but I'm having a hard time

610
00:32:16,596 --> 00:32:20,198
- getting in position for repair.
- Well, remember your anatomy.

611
00:32:21,176 --> 00:32:23,009
This is Cade's father,

612
00:32:23,011 --> 00:32:24,179
so maybe in this case, you should...

613
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:25,695
The Whipple is the crucible

614
00:32:25,697 --> 00:32:28,940
of a surgical residency,
it's the final test.

615
00:32:28,942 --> 00:32:31,293
Just get in there and ace it.

616
00:32:32,463 --> 00:32:34,445
It's your OR, Dr. Devi.

617
00:32:34,447 --> 00:32:36,356
- Proceed.
- Right.

618
00:32:36,358 --> 00:32:38,342
Dr. Chu, reverse positioning
of the patient, please.

619
00:32:40,195 --> 00:32:41,619
Okay, that's excellent.

620
00:32:41,621 --> 00:32:44,455
You have a clear path to the defect.

621
00:32:44,457 --> 00:32:47,392
3.0 Prolene to you.

622
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,397
Closing and oversewing.

623

Hemodynamics settling.

624
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:04,660
That's strong work, Dr. Devi.

625
00:33:08,815 --> 00:33:10,891
She rose to the occasion.

626
00:33:10,893 --> 00:33:12,242
Yes, she did.

627
00:33:12,244 --> 00:33:16,062
He's gonna make it out
of the OR, isn't he?

628
00:33:16,064 --> 00:33:17,297
Yeah.

629
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:22,010
Now we just have to make
sure the cancer hasn't spread.

630
00:33:22,012 --> 00:33:24,179

She has very low standards.

Nope. Nothing but the

That's not what I want to talk about.

Do you still feel the
same way you did before?

I do.

I can't promise I'll want a child
in the future, but maybe I will.

653
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:29,227
- I don't know.
- Today I watched a man

654
00:34:29,229 --> 00:34:31,079
sacrifice his wife's best chance to live

655
00:34:31,081 --> 00:34:33,823
for a baby that hasn't even been born.

656
00:34:33,825 --> 00:34:36,126

wants to be a general surgeon.

I know you're gonna be a loving dad

709
00:36:46,691 --> 00:36:48,541
and a great role model.

710
00:36:48,543 --> 00:36:53,787
Just meet me halfway and... listen?

711
00:36:53,789 --> 00:36:55,214
I can do that.

712
00:36:55,216 --> 00:36:57,291
But what can I do for you now?

713
00:36:57,293 --> 00:37:01,312
Hmm, maybe open up another 529 account?

714
00:37:01,314 --> 00:37:02,555
For college?

715
00:37:02,557 --> 00:37:04,816

I was happy to hear about your dad.

Rumor has it that Kit may offer him

the peds surgery job at Chastain.

731
00:37:36,183 --> 00:37:39,258
I heard. I have mixed
feelings about that.

732
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,760
It would be a big adjustment.

733
00:37:40,762 --> 00:37:43,021
Conrad will help you with that.

734
00:37:43,857 --> 00:37:45,481
He already has.

Hey.

Mm, wild guess,

744
00:38:58,265 --> 00:38:59,931
you're not taking the
job at Advanced Sciences.

745
00:38:59,933 --> 00:39:02,158
And I won't be sleeping
on your sofa anymore.

746
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,510

Our first date after Gigi was
born. A lot of memories here.

Well...

755
00:39:26,367 --> 00:39:28,918

Her husband doesn't have much longer.

There's something else
I wanted to tell you.

767
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,491
They have a child.

768
00:40:46,493 --> 00:40:49,735
A little boy. He won't
even remember his father.

769
00:40:49,737 --> 00:40:52,580
That's awful.

770
00:40:54,242 --> 00:40:57,393
We both know what it's
like to lose a parent.

771
00:40:57,395 --> 00:40:59,745
I bought a life insurance policy.

772
00:40:59,897 --> 00:41:02,657
- You did what?
- Yep.

773
00:41:02,659 --> 00:41:04,307
A big one.

774
00:41:04,309 --> 00:41:07,219
Well, you're not gonna die, so...

775
00:41:07,221 --> 00:41:08,496
I certainly hope not.

776
00:41:08,498 --> 00:41:11,148
Mm, that wasn't a
statement, that was an order.

777
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:13,242
You know, maybe stop
riding your bike to work.

778
00:41:13,244 --> 00:41:15,411
Maybe ease up on the
search and rescue missions.

779
00:41:15,413 --> 00:41:17,821
No matter how careful I
am, anything could happen.

780
00:41:17,823 --> 00:41:19,823
I could get hit by a bolt of lightning.

781
00:41:19,825 --> 00:41:21,842
- Stop, come on.
- We have to talk about this for a reason.

782
00:41:21,844 --> 00:41:23,903
Watching Anna and her
husband in the hospital,

783
00:41:23,905 --> 00:41:26,154
it just made me think,
what if that was me...

784
00:41:26,256 --> 00:41:27,923
... in that hospital bed?

785
00:41:27,925 --> 00:41:30,926
You know, I don't want to talk
about any of this right now.

786
00:41:30,928 --> 00:41:32,502
- Just drop it.
- If something happens to me,

787
00:41:32,504 --> 00:41:33,746

and I want you to love someone again.

789
00:41:40,104 --> 00:41:41,696
I mean, don't bring
a date to my funeral.

790
00:41:41,698 --> 00:41:43,772
Oh, my God. Seriously?

791
00:41:43,774 --> 00:41:45,591
Come on.

792
00:41:45,593 --> 00:41:47,017
Unless they're nice and Gigi likes them.

793
00:41:47,019 --> 00:41:49,412
- Then that's fine, okay?
- Conrad.

794
00:41:59,882 --> 00:42:03,384
After a while, I do want you to move on.

795
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:11,617
You deserve happiness,
and Gigi deserves a father.
