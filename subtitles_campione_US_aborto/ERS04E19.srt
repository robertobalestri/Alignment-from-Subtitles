1
00:00:03,889 --> 00:00:06,772
ER

2
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:08,255
Previously on ER...

3
00:00:08,256 --> 00:00:11,540
Gamma, if that is all you think of me,
then you can keep your money.

4
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:12,859
As you wish, John.

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:13,860
Cancer's back.

6
00:00:13,861 --> 00:00:18,102
Your bone marrow failed to match
the last two potential donors.

7
00:00:18,503 --> 00:00:20,522
I don't want any more chemo.

8
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:24,657
- Gather all the charts and the tape.
- The tape?

9
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:26,866
We often tape laparoscopic procedures.

10
00:00:26,867 --> 00:00:29,966
Don't pull so hard with the Babcock.
You'll tear the gastric artery.

11
00:00:29,967 --> 00:00:31,662
- I'm not pulling.
- Oh, son of a bitch!

12
00:00:31,663 --> 00:00:33,908
- He's lost too much blood. Let's open.
- We're losing him.

13
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:35,578
Doctor, it's been three minutes.

14
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,250
He's dying. Move!

15
00:00:38,173 --> 00:00:40,855
"Shades Of Gray"

16
00:00:45,721 --> 00:00:47,344
Cubs fan, huh?

17
00:00:47,555 --> 00:00:50,045
- Please don't touch that.
- Right. I'm sorry.

18
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:55,426
Before I make any decisions about
your loan application...

19
00:00:55,643 --> 00:00:57,717
...I have to clarify a few points.

20
00:00:57,894 --> 00:00:59,091
Yeah?

21
00:00:59,353 --> 00:01:03,847
You only included one tax return,
1996, listing your income...

22
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:08,807
...as a surgical resident with
an annual salary of $28,000?

23
00:01:09,025 --> 00:01:10,898
Yeah. Before taxes.

24
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,692
We'll need your other returns
from previous years.

25
00:01:14,902 --> 00:01:17,606
There aren't any. Before that,
I was a med student.

26
00:01:17,821 --> 00:01:18,899
No summer jobs?

27
00:01:19,238 --> 00:01:20,648
Well, I...

28
00:01:21,405 --> 00:01:24,690
- ... crewed in the Whitbread in 1990.
- Where was that?

29
00:01:25,282 --> 00:01:27,819
Capetown. Fremantle.

30
00:01:28,034 --> 00:01:30,073
Capsized between Sydney and Auckland.

31
00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:33,244
It's a yacht race.

32
00:01:33,412 --> 00:01:35,238
And you earned?

33
00:01:36,205 --> 00:01:40,496
A few thousand.
But after living expenses...

34
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:43,164
I spent more than I made.

35
00:01:43,501 --> 00:01:47,745
You're a Resident in emergency
medicine now. Is that correct?

36
00:01:48,252 --> 00:01:53,209
Yeah. When I shifted from surgery,
I agreed to do so without pay.

37
00:01:54,298 --> 00:01:57,166
But I'm gonna ask for a paycheck
next year, for sure.

38
00:01:57,382 --> 00:01:59,041
I would hope so.

39
00:02:00,301 --> 00:02:01,758
What about this trust fund?

40
00:02:01,926 --> 00:02:04,842
The holdings are in
my grandfather's name...

41
00:02:05,053 --> 00:02:07,803
...and I am no longer
drawing funds from it.

42
00:02:08,012 --> 00:02:10,419
Would he be willing to
cosign for your loan?

43
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,421
I want my application to be
judged on its own merits.

44
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:17,136
- On its own merits, I must reject it.
- Why?

45
00:02:17,351 --> 00:02:18,892
Either talk to your grandfather...

46
00:02:19,101 --> 00:02:23,428
...or acquaint yourself with
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.

47
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:27,682
- Peter?
- Dr. Morgenstern.

48
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:33,599
I looked over your report for the
Morbidity and Mortality Conference.

49
00:02:33,817 --> 00:02:36,188
It was quite evenhanded.

50
00:02:36,402 --> 00:02:38,892
Well, I just charted what happened.

51
00:02:39,112 --> 00:02:42,444
Sometimes these things can become
so "he said, she said. "

52
00:02:42,613 --> 00:02:44,735
- There's no need for that.
- No, no.

53
00:02:45,407 --> 00:02:49,189
Lizzie and I did an aortobifemoral
bypass in 2 hours, 20 minutes.

54
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:51,401
Well, that's wonderful, Robert.

55
00:02:51,618 --> 00:02:54,950
Is M and M still on, or can I buy
Lizzie a five-egg omelet?

56
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,282
It's still on.

57
00:02:56,496 --> 00:02:59,116
Looks like you're not out of
the hot seat yet.

58
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:00,409
Will Anspaugh be there?

59
00:03:00,622 --> 00:03:04,701
No. He requested that I messenger
the meeting notes over to his house.

60
00:03:04,917 --> 00:03:06,079
Is the funeral today?

61
00:03:06,292 --> 00:03:08,960
- Yeah.
- I sent flowers from the department.

62
00:03:11,753 --> 00:03:14,669
Well, looks like a cruller
and a Coke is all we have time for.

63
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,525
My treat!

64
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:43,158
Mark? I'm going to a surgical
M and M. Can you cover for an hour?

65
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,658
Sure, what's going on?

66
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:46,324
It's the Swanson laparoscopy.

67
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,868
Right. Peter's case.

68
00:04:48,082 --> 00:04:49,492
It's actually Dr. Morgenstern.

69
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:53,205
Right. Have fun.
I'll hold down the fort.

70
00:04:53,417 --> 00:04:54,496
I thought you said...

71
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:55,995
- ... he's the best.
- He is!

72
00:04:56,169 --> 00:04:58,041
He rolled my med school loan into...

73
00:04:58,252 --> 00:05:00,623
...a Sallie Mae, Fannie Mae, Ellie Mae,
whatever.

74
00:05:00,837 --> 00:05:04,204
All I know is I don't have to eat
meals out of a can anymore.

75
00:05:04,422 --> 00:05:06,496
- Did you catch that Sox game?
- Missed it.

76
00:05:06,714 --> 00:05:10,247
Center fielder, pop fly,
catching a few z's. Pay up!

77
00:05:10,466 --> 00:05:12,089
I'm short right now.
Can I get you?

78
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,334
Sure. I know you're good for it.

79
00:05:15,676 --> 00:05:18,000
My aunt made a killing
selling Tupperware.

80
00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:21,088
- Tupperware?
- Those little plastic storage things-

81
00:05:21,303 --> 00:05:23,757
- I know what Tupperware is.
- How about Amway?

82
00:05:23,971 --> 00:05:26,923
- You're really enjoying this.
- Yeah, a little.

83
00:05:27,181 --> 00:05:29,586
- Heads up, doctors!
- Carter, you're up.

84
00:05:30,348 --> 00:05:32,506
This day gets better and better,
doesn't it?

85
00:05:32,682 --> 00:05:34,010
Grabarsky, who do you got?

86
00:05:34,225 --> 00:05:38,136
Mike Lembreaux. Doesn't know
when to say when. Fell over a curb.

87
00:05:38,352 --> 00:05:41,054
A curb? Maybe we should
have those removed.

88
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:42,679
His wrist looks pretty bad.

89
00:05:42,853 --> 00:05:46,219
Well, from the smell of things,
we can skip the pain medication.

90
00:05:46,521 --> 00:05:48,642
Let's check out that wrist,
Mr. Lembreaux.

91
00:05:48,855 --> 00:05:52,186
I wanted to eulogize him somehow,
but I...

92
00:05:54,024 --> 00:05:57,106
I never felt comfortable
in his mother's church.

93
00:05:58,234 --> 00:06:01,233
So austere.

94
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,691
No pomp and ceremony, just...

95
00:06:04,861 --> 00:06:06,900
...silent judgment.

96
00:06:08,113 --> 00:06:10,816
I thought the silence
was for contemplation.

97
00:06:11,864 --> 00:06:13,441
It's just...

98
00:06:13,698 --> 00:06:17,693
Well, you can imagine how
her Quaker parents felt...

99
00:06:17,908 --> 00:06:20,991
...when she brought home
a West Point man.

100
00:06:23,327 --> 00:06:25,448
Well, you ended up getting married.

101
00:06:26,161 --> 00:06:27,323
Yeah.

102
00:06:28,704 --> 00:06:30,778
The hawk and the dove.

103
00:06:33,456 --> 00:06:35,079
Long time ago.

104
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:40,868
Scotty...

105
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:45,584
...wanted you to have
the stuff in this box.

106
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:51,086
Green Day.

107
00:06:52,713 --> 00:06:55,381
I'm surprised he didn't burn a hole
through this one.

108
00:07:00,007 --> 00:07:02,876
- What?
- Soap Opera Digest.

109
00:07:04,885 --> 00:07:08,334
I knew he was getting those future
plots from somewhere.

110
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,631
The most important aspect of
M and M...

111
00:07:11,845 --> 00:07:14,251
...is not to linger on our missteps...

112
00:07:14,472 --> 00:07:17,424
...but to analyze every case
as a teaching tool.

113
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:20,217
Dr. Benton.

114
00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:30,847
Thank you.

115
00:07:31,394 --> 00:07:33,303
- Gonna need a reduction.
- An open reduction.

116
00:07:33,521 --> 00:07:38,428
- Internal fixation in the O.R.
- Not so fast. You're not in surgery.

117
00:07:38,647 --> 00:07:41,220
I got my real ones knocked out
in Joliet.

118
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,894
He can't breathe!
He can't breathe!

119
00:07:44,108 --> 00:07:47,060
- I'm showing him something.
- Keep breathing on the nebulizer.

120
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:49,902
- Leave this kid alone.
- Get him out of here.

121
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:52,854
- Put your teeth back in your mouth.
- I can talk to anybody!

122
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,232
Take deep breaths.

123
00:07:54,404 --> 00:07:56,359
Don't tell me what to do.
Leave me alone!

124
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,567
Guys, get the soft restraints!

125
00:08:01,739 --> 00:08:03,696
Leave me alone!
Leave me alone!

126
00:08:03,908 --> 00:08:05,566
Stop it! Leave me alone!

127
00:08:06,533 --> 00:08:08,074
Please help him!

128
00:08:09,534 --> 00:08:12,403
You'll be fine. He's cyanotic!
I'm gonna intubate him.

129
00:08:12,619 --> 00:08:14,278
- Check his right wrist.
- I'm intubating.

130
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:16,444
- Get me 40 of ketamine.
- Forty of ketamine

131
00:08:17,037 --> 00:08:19,243
What are you doing bringing
a psycho in here?

132
00:08:19,413 --> 00:08:22,661
- I didn't realize.
- This boy is a critical asthma patient.

133
00:08:22,873 --> 00:08:25,078
Nobody cares about Pedes.
5.0 ETtube.

134
00:08:25,249 --> 00:08:28,034
- I'm really sorry.
- Here we go. Give me suction.

135
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:32,410
Morgenstern's attempt to control the
hemorrhage by incision was futile.

136
00:08:32,626 --> 00:08:36,159
Bleeding obscured the operative field,
but we were controlling it.

137
00:08:36,586 --> 00:08:39,206
- It was difficult.
- What did you do next?

138
00:08:39,421 --> 00:08:40,830
Called for additional suction.

139
00:08:41,046 --> 00:08:43,915
Then you decided to change
course and open the chest.

140
00:08:44,131 --> 00:08:45,588
Who made that incision?

141
00:08:48,883 --> 00:08:49,913
I did.

142
00:08:50,134 --> 00:08:52,255
Morgenstern allowed you
to crack the chest?

143
00:08:52,426 --> 00:08:54,085
- Not exactly-
- I didn't feel it-

144
00:08:54,302 --> 00:08:56,423
Gentlemen, one at a time.

145
00:08:57,094 --> 00:08:58,256
Dr. Benton?

146
00:09:01,554 --> 00:09:02,882
I took over the surgery.

147
00:09:03,097 --> 00:09:04,590
What do you mean, "take over"?

148
00:09:04,806 --> 00:09:08,588
In the heat of the moment,
Dr. Benton became agitated.

149
00:09:08,807 --> 00:09:10,182
Dr. Benton?

150
00:09:12,266 --> 00:09:13,546
I pushed him aside.

151
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:15,889
What was your justification
for such an action?

152
00:09:16,102 --> 00:09:17,263
The man was bleeding out.

153
00:09:17,643 --> 00:09:20,678
The midline incision was adequate.
It was the varices.

154
00:09:20,937 --> 00:09:23,427
No. He needed
to be cracked immediately.

155
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:26,094
And that justifies committing battery?

156
00:09:26,272 --> 00:09:28,429
The man was dying.
Would you have stood there?

157
00:09:28,606 --> 00:09:30,563
I would have assisted the Attending.

158
00:09:30,774 --> 00:09:33,263
After three minutes of
arterial bleeding...

159
00:09:33,442 --> 00:09:36,394
...cross-clamping the aorta was
the only alternative.

160
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,565
No, Peter. I don't think it was.

161
00:09:38,777 --> 00:09:40,603
No, it was the only alternative!

162
00:09:40,777 --> 00:09:43,184
Gentlemen, it's best to adjourn...

163
00:09:43,362 --> 00:09:47,025
...and convene a resident review
at 12:30 to discuss it.

164
00:09:47,238 --> 00:09:48,696
I agree. Dr. Morgenstern?

165
00:09:48,948 --> 00:09:52,990
Yes. I think that would be for the best.

166
00:09:55,116 --> 00:09:56,444
What do we have here?

167
00:09:56,659 --> 00:09:59,776
A 28-year-old woman, 18 weeks
pregnant, found unconscious.

168
00:09:59,952 --> 00:10:03,117
- GCS 11, multiple lacs, vitals stable.
- Let's go!

169
00:10:03,328 --> 00:10:05,284
The Chicago Reproductive Center
was bombed.

170
00:10:05,496 --> 00:10:06,776
The abortion clinic?

171
00:10:06,954 --> 00:10:11,115
They also do prenatal care. They're
still pulling people from the rubble.

172
00:10:11,331 --> 00:10:12,872
Blowing up clinics. Bastards!

173
00:10:13,082 --> 00:10:15,867
- How many we got?
- No idea. It's chaos down there.

174
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:20,125
We got a 17-year-old, second trimester.
Chest pain, shortness of breath.

175
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:24,289
BP's real low, 80/50.
Pulse 120. Resps 24.

176
00:10:24,461 --> 00:10:26,785
You're gonna be okay.
You're at a hospital.

177
00:10:27,003 --> 00:10:28,118
- Donny?
- I'm right here.

178
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:30,460
- Her name?
- Zoe Kearney. A wall fell on her.

179
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,580
- How far along is she?
- Six months.

180
00:10:32,756 --> 00:10:33,787
Clear Trauma 1!

181
00:10:34,007 --> 00:10:37,006
We can't release patient
information over the phone.

182
00:10:37,216 --> 00:10:40,548
The hospital has no official
comment at this time.

183
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:44,422
It's the Trib. They want to know
if any abortion docs died.

184
00:10:44,636 --> 00:10:47,385
They're "gynecologists. "
We don't have any information.

185
00:10:47,595 --> 00:10:50,345
A vanload of protesters with
minor injuries came in.

186
00:10:50,555 --> 00:10:52,961
Triage them.
We're swamped with criticals.

187
00:10:53,222 --> 00:10:56,470
Something's wrong with my ears.
No one is helping me.

188
00:10:56,641 --> 00:10:58,678
We're really busy, but someone will
get to you as soon as they can.

189
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:00,598
Please! I've been in a bombing.

190
00:11:00,809 --> 00:11:03,594
I know. We'll get you a room
as soon as we can.

191
00:11:05,727 --> 00:11:07,055
Have somebody look at that.

192
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,474
- What?
- Your head.

193
00:11:09,646 --> 00:11:10,676
Thirty-two French.

194
00:11:10,854 --> 00:11:12,228
- Urine dip's negative.
- Blood gas?

195
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,186
PO289. PCO225.
PH 7.29 on 10 liters.

196
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:18,642
Borderline, but okay.

197
00:11:18,815 --> 00:11:20,143
Resps down to 27.

198
00:11:20,316 --> 00:11:23,683
Fetal heart rate 140.
No contractions. Mom's 110/60.

199
00:11:23,901 --> 00:11:25,892
- Where's my boyfriend?
- He's outside.

200
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,140
Is he okay?

201
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,316
- He's fine. Relax.
- Still want the blood?

202
00:11:29,486 --> 00:11:32,106
Hang a unit of red cells.
Get her to CT.

203
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,988
- Come on, let's go. Got it?
- Yeah.

204
00:11:35,197 --> 00:11:36,571
Send her blood to Radiology.

205
00:11:36,781 --> 00:11:38,487
- Where's she going?
- Taking her to CT.

206
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:40,778
- What's on the scope?
- Sinus tach at 120.

207
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:44,155
- Let OB know where we're going!
- I'm right behind you, okay?

208
00:11:44,992 --> 00:11:47,113
Was she in for an abortion
or prenatal care?

209
00:11:47,326 --> 00:11:50,528
She's 18, 19 weeks. Kind of
late for an AB, don't you think?

210
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:52,570
We've got fetal heart tones, 145.

211
00:11:52,787 --> 00:11:56,485
CBC, type and cross for four
units, and cath a urine.

212
00:11:56,663 --> 00:11:59,828
Pulse ox 98. BP 90/70.
Good cap refill.

213
00:12:00,331 --> 00:12:01,659
Also get a chest.

214
00:12:01,874 --> 00:12:04,743
Shield her abdomen
and let's prep her for a pelvic.

215
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:08,159
I've got her chart. Brianna Thomas,
18-week-pregnant nullip.

216
00:12:08,376 --> 00:12:11,577
- In for a suction extraction.
- An abortion?

217
00:12:11,836 --> 00:12:13,827
Looks like they didn't finish.

218
00:12:14,503 --> 00:12:16,578
BP's dropped, 80/50. Pulse 110.

219
00:12:16,795 --> 00:12:19,001
She's hemorrhaging.
Complete the AB.

220
00:12:19,213 --> 00:12:20,328
Grab a gyn tray.

221
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:23,507
Grab a tray!
We need to evacuate the uterus.

222
00:12:24,007 --> 00:12:27,172
- Now, doctor.
- I can't.

223
00:12:29,342 --> 00:12:31,500
Speculum! Betadine!

224
00:12:31,843 --> 00:12:34,297
Set suction on high, and get me...

225
00:12:34,511 --> 00:12:36,467
...a size 14 cannula. Let's go!

226
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:41,069
- Second liter's in.
- Hang a third and repeat a crit.

227
00:12:44,704 --> 00:12:46,698
Anna? Can I speak to you
for a moment?

228
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,161
Sure.

229
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:52,460
- Kerry, you want some coffee?
- No, thanks.

230
00:12:56,931 --> 00:12:58,972
What happened in that trauma today?

231
00:12:59,184 --> 00:13:02,140
- I'm sorry. I froze.
- That can't happen.

232
00:13:02,356 --> 00:13:03,685
I couldn't complete the abortion.

233
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,359
- Why not?
- I don't know.

234
00:13:05,569 --> 00:13:08,572
The fetus was so far along and-

235
00:13:08,783 --> 00:13:11,405
What about Brianna Thomas?
Your patient was hemorrhaging.

236
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,030
I don't know. I didn't ex-

237
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,042
The baby had a chance, you know?

238
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:19,706
There are patients and procedures
that we might find distasteful-

239
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:23,925
Distasteful? Come on, Kerry,
I'm not squeamish. It just felt wrong.

240
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:28,010
We can't allow our feelings
to dictate our standard of care.

241
00:13:28,187 --> 00:13:29,220
- I don't.
- But you did.

242
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,398
Your moral objection to abortion-

243
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,235
I don't have a moral objection!

244
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:35,985
Well, something happened
in there today.

245
00:13:38,412 --> 00:13:40,406
I'm his son, Burke.
He lives with me.

246
00:13:40,624 --> 00:13:42,166
How long has he been wetting the bed?

247
00:13:42,376 --> 00:13:44,999
Maybe two days.
He smelled pretty bad.

248
00:13:45,214 --> 00:13:47,789
- He's had urine infections before.
- Right.

249
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:50,087
Temp's 102, and he looks dehydrated.

250
00:13:50,305 --> 00:13:53,225
We try to get him to eat
or drink, but he won't.

251
00:13:53,435 --> 00:13:57,269
Let's start a line of normal saline.
Give him a 500 cc bolus.

252
00:13:57,441 --> 00:14:00,016
CBC, Chem-20, blood cultures
times two, urine CNS.

253
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:01,311
You got it.

254
00:14:02,157 --> 00:14:04,067
I don't think that's necessary.

255
00:14:04,286 --> 00:14:06,529
Before, they just gave him antibiotics.

256
00:14:06,748 --> 00:14:08,409
We need to do a full evaluation.

257
00:14:09,168 --> 00:14:13,120
- If you're worried about being sued-
- It's nothing to do with being sued.

258
00:14:13,341 --> 00:14:15,085
You'll poke him and prod him...

259
00:14:15,302 --> 00:14:18,755
...and then thousands of dollars later,
you'll give him antibiotics.

260
00:14:19,309 --> 00:14:21,801
Go have a seat while we
work on your dad.

261
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:23,476
Unbe-friggin-lievable!

262
00:14:23,691 --> 00:14:26,479
Grab a blood gas kit and show
Mr. Newton to Chairs.

263
00:14:26,653 --> 00:14:28,064
I can show myself.

264
00:14:29,241 --> 00:14:30,320
He's a charmer.

265
00:14:31,119 --> 00:14:33,611
When's the last time anyone
bathed this guy?

266
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:38,083
From the looks of these bedsores,
about the same time they turned him.

267
00:14:38,672 --> 00:14:40,915
So much for "honor thy father. "

268
00:14:41,176 --> 00:14:44,511
I don't understand your argument.
The decision has been made.

269
00:14:44,723 --> 00:14:47,180
Dr. Benton allowed his emotions
to get a little out of hand.

270
00:14:47,352 --> 00:14:49,013
Otherwise, he's a good resident.

271
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:50,731
Who committed battery.

272
00:14:50,941 --> 00:14:54,146
Peter's a good surgeon.
But you can't let this stand.

273
00:14:54,363 --> 00:14:57,033
Like you said, Dr. Weaver,
the decision's been made.

274
00:14:57,242 --> 00:14:58,868
Unless you have a problem with it?

275
00:15:00,498 --> 00:15:01,577
No.

276
00:15:02,876 --> 00:15:05,665
Debra, would you ask Dr. Benton
to come in, please?

277
00:15:19,109 --> 00:15:23,026
Dr. Benton, we have reviewed
Dr. Swanson's chart and the autopsy.

278
00:15:23,241 --> 00:15:26,528
I thought the autopsy was inconclusive
due to the state of the body.

279
00:15:26,746 --> 00:15:30,580
Regardless, this committee feels the
matter warrants further investigation.

280
00:15:30,794 --> 00:15:34,746
I don't know what to say. Everything
I saw and did is in this report.

281
00:15:34,968 --> 00:15:36,676
Chart aside, you pushed an Attending.

282
00:15:36,887 --> 00:15:39,427
You're out of the rotation
pending a formal inquiry.

283
00:15:43,856 --> 00:15:44,888
You're suspending me?

284
00:15:45,109 --> 00:15:48,444
Until Dr. Anspaugh returns
and there's a full investigation.

285
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:53,236
When can I return to my job?

286
00:15:53,454 --> 00:15:55,032
We don't know yet.

287
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,951
- And this is effective...?
- Immediately.

288
00:16:08,936 --> 00:16:13,067
She threw three PVCs, unifocal,
no R on T. Should I give her lidocaine?

289
00:16:13,277 --> 00:16:14,308
Three? No. Let's observe.

290
00:16:14,528 --> 00:16:17,531
Her chest tube stopped draining.
300 cc's.

291
00:16:17,742 --> 00:16:19,285
Resps are a little high at 26.

292
00:16:19,495 --> 00:16:22,866
Zoe, we looked at your CT.
There's no evidence of organ damage.

293
00:16:23,084 --> 00:16:25,457
We still want to
admit you for observation.

294
00:16:25,671 --> 00:16:27,250
- For how long?
- We're not sure.

295
00:16:27,966 --> 00:16:29,426
It's kind of hard to breathe.

296
00:16:29,635 --> 00:16:31,511
- Pulse ox always 94?
- No. It's down.

297
00:16:31,722 --> 00:16:33,632
I'm fine. What about the baby?

298
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:37,850
You have fetal heart tones,
which means that the baby is alive.

299
00:16:38,023 --> 00:16:39,518
As for kicking, you tell me.

300
00:16:40,068 --> 00:16:42,109
- We should name him Lucky, huh?
- "Her. "

301
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,654
- I have a feeling.
- Do you want to see him or her?

302
00:16:44,868 --> 00:16:46,945
- We're gonna do an ultrasound.
- Yeah, cool.

303
00:16:48,956 --> 00:16:49,989
Zoe, what's wrong?

304
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:52,327
- BP's down to 60 palp.
- Are you in pain?

305
00:16:52,546 --> 00:16:55,252
- Pulse ox 90!
- She's bradying down! Let's go!

306
00:16:55,467 --> 00:16:57,128
Hang on. Step back!

307
00:16:57,387 --> 00:17:00,224
Pulse is 40. You gotta give us
room to work here.

308
00:17:00,434 --> 00:17:01,679
Oh, no! No!

309
00:17:01,894 --> 00:17:03,223
- Pulmonary embolus?
- Probably.

310
00:17:03,438 --> 00:17:06,393
- Repeat a gas,.5 atropine.
- Damn!

311
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,561
All right. Start CPR.

312
00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:12,903
This one is almost to the bone.

313
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:16,579
I've seen all I need to see.
I'll put this paperwork through.

314
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,753
Hopefully, we'll get him
into an extended care facility.

315
00:17:19,963 --> 00:17:22,586
- I'd appreciate it.
- I just need you to sign this.

316
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:24,884
I'll run it down to the courthouse.

317
00:17:25,096 --> 00:17:27,221
Thank you for taking
care of this so quickly.

318
00:17:27,434 --> 00:17:31,765
I'd say it was my pleasure, but see
how people treat their own parents?

319
00:17:31,982 --> 00:17:33,098
Yeah.

320
00:17:35,946 --> 00:17:39,033
Dr. Carter, what gives?
I've been sitting here forever.

321
00:17:39,243 --> 00:17:42,281
Your father exhibited
textbook signs of neglect.

322
00:17:42,457 --> 00:17:44,866
- That's crazy.
- He hasn't been bathed for weeks.

323
00:17:45,085 --> 00:17:48,338
He's covered in feces.
He's got bedsores to the bone.

324
00:17:48,591 --> 00:17:51,297
I've recommended that he be placed
in an adult-care facility.

325
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,548
You don't have any say.
I have power of attorney.

326
00:17:53,766 --> 00:17:56,305
The hospital has claimed
temporary guardianship.

327
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:59,053
Really? Who'll pay?
I handle the Medicare.

328
00:17:59,274 --> 00:18:03,226
His Medicare payments will be
transferred to the facility he's in.

329
00:18:06,535 --> 00:18:08,612
Expect to hear from my lawyer.

330
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,701
Look forward to it.

331
00:18:11,502 --> 00:18:13,828
It feels like there's something in there.

332
00:18:14,047 --> 00:18:16,504
With all that glass flying
after the explosion...

333
00:18:16,676 --> 00:18:18,634
...I didn't want to take a chance.

334
00:18:18,846 --> 00:18:20,721
No, you did the right thing.

335
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:25,019
It's so sad. These extremists...

336
00:18:25,231 --> 00:18:28,269
...blowing up buildings
with people inside.

337
00:18:28,486 --> 00:18:31,738
It's pretty stupid if the idea
is to save lives, huh?

338
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,742
Exactly.

339
00:18:33,953 --> 00:18:37,074
I marched with Dr. King in the '60s.

340
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,700
I thought the world would learn
something from him.

341
00:18:39,879 --> 00:18:41,042
Yeah.

342
00:18:42,132 --> 00:18:44,672
Would you put your chin up here
for me, please?

343
00:18:49,894 --> 00:18:53,561
Must be hard on you as a doctor,
and of course a young woman...

344
00:18:53,734 --> 00:18:58,694
...to know that for every life you save,
they're taking one away in that clinic.

345
00:19:00,368 --> 00:19:02,327
I don't think about it like that.

346
00:19:02,998 --> 00:19:05,122
I don't think a lot of people do.

347
00:19:05,418 --> 00:19:08,089
It's like that old poem
about the Nazis.

348
00:19:08,256 --> 00:19:10,927
You know. First they came
for the Jews...

349
00:19:11,094 --> 00:19:14,262
...then for whoever, and when they
came to take me-

350
00:19:14,432 --> 00:19:17,007
Doctors who perform abortions
aren't Nazis.

351
00:19:17,228 --> 00:19:18,604
Of course not.

352
00:19:18,814 --> 00:19:23,562
But if you sit around while they're
taking the children, who's next?

353
00:19:25,783 --> 00:19:28,536
All right. I see something in there.

354
00:19:28,746 --> 00:19:30,787
I knew I wasn't crazy.

355
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:32,453
Hold real still for me.

356
00:19:36,007 --> 00:19:37,716
I got it.

357
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:41,548
Okay. You're all set.

358
00:19:43,936 --> 00:19:46,559
If you have any discomfort,
you can take some ibuprofen.

359
00:19:46,774 --> 00:19:51,237
Use these drops four times a day.
Come back tomorrow for a re-check.

360
00:19:51,448 --> 00:19:53,240
Thank you.

361
00:19:53,451 --> 00:19:55,076
This is some information
on our group.

362
00:19:55,287 --> 00:19:57,862
We hold strategy meetings
every Wednesday.

363
00:19:58,084 --> 00:19:59,994
- The address is on-
- No, thanks.

364
00:20:00,169 --> 00:20:01,499
Okay.

365
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:04,000
Oh, can't forget this.

366
00:20:04,984 --> 00:20:06,825
STOP ABORTIONIST GENOCIDE

367
00:20:11,771 --> 00:20:14,524
Hey, Miss Martinez! You forgot this.

368
00:20:16,027 --> 00:20:18,520
- I thought we felt the same.
- No, we don't.

369
00:20:18,698 --> 00:20:20,324
You're not a peaceful protester.

370
00:20:20,535 --> 00:20:23,537
That sign is a call to arms.
The bomber saw it, or one like it.

371
00:20:23,748 --> 00:20:27,368
It's reality. If it upsets you,
then it's done its job.

372
00:20:27,587 --> 00:20:32,548
The only job it's done is to encourage
violence. And, yes, that upsets me.

373
00:20:33,388 --> 00:20:36,924
She was okay before.
She was fine. She was talking.

374
00:20:37,143 --> 00:20:41,013
She had a clot in her lung.
It deprived her brain of oxygen.

375
00:20:41,233 --> 00:20:43,393
There's no way to predict
it would happen.

376
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:44,602
Are you sure?

377
00:20:44,822 --> 00:20:49,736
We're gonna do an EEG
and a brain scan to confirm it.

378
00:20:49,997 --> 00:20:51,825
So she's in a coma?

379
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,708
It's like a coma, yeah. Yes.

380
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,250
People come out of comas.

381
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:03,933
Not when the brain has been deprived
of oxygen as long as Zoe's has, no.

382
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:09,810
What about the baby?

383
00:21:12,949 --> 00:21:14,777
The baby appears to be fine.

384
00:21:16,454 --> 00:21:18,745
Can you save her?

385
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:21,367
Probably. I think so, yeah.

386
00:21:22,464 --> 00:21:23,959
And it's a girl?

387
00:21:25,134 --> 00:21:26,298
Yes.

388
00:21:32,062 --> 00:21:33,972
You hear that, Zoe?

389
00:21:36,152 --> 00:21:37,647
You were right.

390
00:21:38,739 --> 00:21:40,151
It's a girl.

391
00:21:43,329 --> 00:21:45,822
- Wanted to talk to you before I left.
- Aren't you on till 7?

392
00:21:46,042 --> 00:21:49,329
- No. I've been suspended.
- You're not serious?

393
00:21:49,548 --> 00:21:52,384
- Yeah, well, I wish I wasn't.
- We need help here, now!

394
00:21:52,593 --> 00:21:55,086
I'll call you later, okay?
What have we got?

395
00:21:55,306 --> 00:21:59,258
She's my trainee. She got crushed
underneath some unstable debris.

396
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,351
- We took care of all the traumas.
- People were trapped underneath.

397
00:22:02,526 --> 00:22:06,941
BP 60 palp. Pulse 150 and thready.
IV's infiltrated, poor cap refill.

398
00:22:07,158 --> 00:22:09,318
- Dr. Corday?
- Oh, my God! Allison!

399
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:12,539
- Clear Trauma 1! EBL on scene?
- Half a liter.

400
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,542
Hope you didn't mess up
my beautiful graft.

401
00:22:14,753 --> 00:22:17,375
- We need X-ray in here now.
- Blood bank on their way.

402
00:22:18,801 --> 00:22:23,050
A 48-year-old custodian.
Multiple lacs to the chest and back.

403
00:22:23,224 --> 00:22:25,384
BP's 70/30. Pulse thready at 144.

404
00:22:25,603 --> 00:22:26,884
Sir, are you with us?

405
00:22:27,105 --> 00:22:28,435
- Peter?
- I'm on my way home.

406
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:31,522
- Very funny.
- I'm not joking. I've been suspended.

407
00:22:31,738 --> 00:22:33,862
Not by me you haven't. I need you!

408
00:22:36,203 --> 00:22:37,235
All right.

409
00:22:37,413 --> 00:22:41,676
Let's get 6 shooters O-neg. Call
the trauma team, we're on our way.

410
00:22:43,894 --> 00:22:45,685
All right, let's roll him.

411
00:22:45,896 --> 00:22:47,974
Open pneumothorax. Let's tube him.

412
00:22:48,191 --> 00:22:49,900
Damn it. We got a pumper!

413
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:52,567
- No pulse!
- All right. Start CPR.

414
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,405
We need to crack him.
Thoracotomy tray.

415
00:22:54,616 --> 00:22:56,573
- Cricoid pressure?
- Here's your 10 blade.

416
00:22:56,743 --> 00:22:58,736
A 7.5 ET tube. Let's go.

417
00:23:00,874 --> 00:23:02,533
- Suction.
- There it is.

418
00:23:02,751 --> 00:23:05,242
Dramatic aortic dissection
and rupture.

419
00:23:05,462 --> 00:23:07,122
I'm in! Hyperventilate him.

420
00:23:07,339 --> 00:23:08,454
Can you get the Satinsky in?

421
00:23:08,674 --> 00:23:11,083
No. I'm sticking my finger in.

422
00:23:11,261 --> 00:23:13,052
Don't let go.
You stopped the bleeding.

423
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:16,173
- I'm holding CPR. Carotid pulse?
- Faint.

424
00:23:17,769 --> 00:23:19,761
Pump in more O-neg.
Get him upstairs.

425
00:23:19,938 --> 00:23:22,560
Malik, you stay with us.
Keep bagging him.

426
00:23:22,775 --> 00:23:25,610
Let's go, people!
Go, go, go!

427
00:23:27,238 --> 00:23:28,781
Alert the bypass team.

428
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,942
You set the pace.
We're following you.

429
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,823
Watch that IV. Call the O.R.,
tell them we're coming!

430
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:35,533
Dr. Benton, I thought
you understood-

431
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:38,038
Not now.
He's tamponing an aortic tear.

432
00:23:38,252 --> 00:23:41,039
- Don't jostle the gurney.
- Carry on.

433
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:43,581
All right, hit five.

434
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,471
- We need four units O-neg.
- What's up, Lizzie?

435
00:23:46,638 --> 00:23:48,963
Decreased breath,
hyper-resonant, hemopneumo.

436
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,599
I got the chest tube.

437
00:23:51,101 --> 00:23:52,430
Can we give her morphine?

438
00:23:52,644 --> 00:23:55,397
- Check the BP first.
- It hurts!

439
00:23:55,606 --> 00:23:57,599
You've got rib fractures.
Try not to talk.

440
00:23:57,817 --> 00:24:00,060
Where have I heard that before?

441
00:24:00,613 --> 00:24:01,858
Thora-Seal's filling.

442
00:24:02,072 --> 00:24:03,317
We need an abdominal CT.

443
00:24:03,532 --> 00:24:05,407
She's unstable.
Do a peritoneal lavage.

444
00:24:05,618 --> 00:24:06,899
Type and cross for eight.

445
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,956
Pulse ox is down, 90.
Here's the O-neg.

446
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:11,494
You want me to do it?

447
00:24:11,709 --> 00:24:13,998
No. You do it.

448
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:15,499
Okay.

449
00:24:26,018 --> 00:24:27,217
Hey...

450
00:24:28,229 --> 00:24:31,184
Hi. I'm sorry to wake you up.

451
00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:33,025
I was just resting my eyes.

452
00:24:33,194 --> 00:24:37,358
I brought you juice and a sandwich.
I figured you'd be hungry.

453
00:24:37,574 --> 00:24:38,819
Thanks.

454
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,369
You feeling okay?

455
00:24:41,537 --> 00:24:45,582
Fine, considering.
Were you my doctor?

456
00:24:45,792 --> 00:24:48,794
No. That was Dr. Weaver.

457
00:24:49,004 --> 00:24:51,128
Two docs, no waiting, huh?

458
00:24:52,508 --> 00:24:55,380
My boyfriend brought my clothes.
I'll give you your bed back.

459
00:24:55,554 --> 00:24:58,555
- Are you feeling well enough to go?
- Like I said, I'm fine.

460
00:24:58,725 --> 00:25:03,054
I'd just rather be at home. If you
don't mind, I'm gonna get changed.

461
00:25:03,272 --> 00:25:05,395
Okay. Sure.

462
00:25:06,818 --> 00:25:07,980
Sorry.

463
00:25:11,406 --> 00:25:12,866
Doctor?

464
00:25:14,702 --> 00:25:17,408
Hi, Mr. Newton. How are you feeling?

465
00:25:17,581 --> 00:25:18,910
I'm tired.

466
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:22,535
That's from the dehydration.
Malnutrition, mostly.

467
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:26,419
Where... Where's...
Where's Burke?

468
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:27,920
He left.

469
00:25:28,094 --> 00:25:31,843
He deals with the paperwork.

470
00:25:32,057 --> 00:25:34,097
Your son is no longer your guardian.

471
00:25:35,603 --> 00:25:38,059
For the time being, I am.

472
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:41,264
Why? What?

473
00:25:41,444 --> 00:25:45,607
The elder abuse unit is filing
paperwork to put you into a home.

474
00:25:46,908 --> 00:25:50,278
But I have a home.

475
00:25:50,621 --> 00:25:52,828
You have some very serious
medical problems...

476
00:25:53,041 --> 00:25:57,086
...resulting from what we believe
is very serious neglect.

477
00:25:57,296 --> 00:26:00,048
I'm 86 years old.

478
00:26:01,009 --> 00:26:04,212
I've slept in the same bed...

479
00:26:05,138 --> 00:26:06,419
...for 70 years now.

480
00:26:07,934 --> 00:26:09,891
I'm just trying to help you.

481
00:26:13,816 --> 00:26:18,360
I want to die in my own bed.

482
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,742
You're not sterile. Go scrub.

483
00:26:22,952 --> 00:26:26,120
I'm not letting go. Get 10 units
packed cells. Let's move.

484
00:26:26,331 --> 00:26:29,997
Okay, people,
on my count. One, two, three.

485
00:26:30,211 --> 00:26:32,999
Move this gurney.
Mark, help me roll him.

486
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:36,790
Open the instrument tray.

487
00:26:36,969 --> 00:26:39,009
- No one's gloved and gowned.
- Just do it.

488
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,885
Get gloves, gowns, masks
and caps in here now.

489
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,853
- Okay, 10 blade.
- Get him a mask.

490
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,681
Tonsil sucker.

491
00:26:46,898 --> 00:26:50,018
All right. I'm gonna mobilize
the aorta. Metz!

492
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:53,528
- Let's move, let's move. Come on.
- What's going on?

493
00:26:53,698 --> 00:26:55,856
Peter's got his hand on
this man's aorta.

494
00:26:56,075 --> 00:26:58,532
Potts' clamp.
I'll do a revised clamp-and-run.

495
00:27:00,748 --> 00:27:02,029
Got a second Potts?

496
00:27:03,876 --> 00:27:05,157
Stand by.

497
00:27:06,171 --> 00:27:07,831
Got it.
Take your finger out now.

498
00:27:09,384 --> 00:27:12,135
- Set up the Bovie.
- Pulse is stronger.

499
00:27:12,345 --> 00:27:14,385
Okay, let's go for a BP.

500
00:27:14,598 --> 00:27:16,637
3.0 Prolene on a vascular needle.
Here we go.

501
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:18,393
Suction, please.
Somebody Hoover that.

502
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:20,726
Systolic's up to 80.

503
00:27:20,897 --> 00:27:23,472
Terrific.
Okay, we can take over now.

504
00:27:24,193 --> 00:27:25,818
Bovie, please.

505
00:27:29,574 --> 00:27:31,235
A 30, please. Keep them coming.

506
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:36,287
Retractor and Bovie. Four-by-four
and a sponge stick, please.

507
00:27:36,833 --> 00:27:38,031
Cut that.

508
00:27:38,252 --> 00:27:39,830
Good, good, good.

509
00:27:40,046 --> 00:27:44,424
A 30, keep them coming.
It's looking very good, very good.

510
00:27:50,975 --> 00:27:54,559
- Oh, sweet Jesus!
- There's gotta be another test.

511
00:27:55,148 --> 00:27:58,434
- My angel, sweetheart.
- What's he doing here?

512
00:27:58,652 --> 00:28:01,024
- He was with her during the bombing.
- I bet he was.

513
00:28:01,237 --> 00:28:03,563
- We were getting a checkup.
- You killed my daughter.

514
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:05,028
Proud of yourself?

515
00:28:05,952 --> 00:28:08,740
If she'd stayed with you,
she would've killed herself.

516
00:28:08,956 --> 00:28:10,119
Calm down.

517
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:13,084
He needs to get the hell out of
my daughter's room.

518
00:28:13,294 --> 00:28:14,955
I love her.

519
00:28:15,714 --> 00:28:17,872
You guys treated her like crap.

520
00:28:18,092 --> 00:28:20,417
We're calling an OB consult.
Come with me.

521
00:28:20,637 --> 00:28:24,137
Give them some time alone.
All right? Come on.

522
00:28:24,308 --> 00:28:25,885
Here we go. Come on.

523
00:28:36,697 --> 00:28:38,821
She's been in asystole for 20 minutes.

524
00:28:39,034 --> 00:28:41,608
- Another 7 of epi.
- You already had 10.

525
00:28:41,829 --> 00:28:44,499
- We got a response.
- Two beats is not a response.

526
00:28:44,665 --> 00:28:48,000
- Start an epinephrine drip.
- And a heart transplant too?

527
00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:52,085
Stop being such a prick.
Get me two units of packed cells!

528
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:56,846
- Dr. Weaver?
- Yes.

529
00:28:57,056 --> 00:28:59,464
I wanted to say thanks
for all you did.

530
00:29:00,226 --> 00:29:01,507
The abortion and all.

531
00:29:01,728 --> 00:29:03,352
Right. You're welcome.

532
00:29:03,689 --> 00:29:06,014
It's the most memorable one
I ever got.

533
00:29:06,526 --> 00:29:08,982
- You've had others?
- A few.

534
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:11,856
I thought Earl would want this baby.

535
00:29:12,074 --> 00:29:15,408
Like he'd get serious about us,
but he hit the roof.

536
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,491
Our clinic can advise you on
family planning.

537
00:29:18,707 --> 00:29:21,115
Earl doesn't like that stuff.
Pills make me fat.

538
00:29:21,335 --> 00:29:24,455
There are preferable forms of
birth control than abortion.

539
00:29:24,672 --> 00:29:26,132
Why are you being such a bitch?

540
00:29:26,592 --> 00:29:28,549
Because you're being irresponsible.

541
00:29:28,761 --> 00:29:31,050
More likely, it's because you
don't get any yourself.

542
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,131
It's a very difficult decision.

543
00:29:35,352 --> 00:29:37,760
Neither of which will bring Zoe back.

544
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:41,184
It's true. But if the decision is
to keep the baby...

545
00:29:41,401 --> 00:29:45,400
...you have two options: The first is
we perform an emergency C-section.

546
00:29:45,614 --> 00:29:50,029
We deliver a very premature baby,
and we take Zoe off the respirator.

547
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:54,248
The baby would have to go in
an incubator, right?

548
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:58,167
That's right. Probably months of
intensive care.

549
00:29:58,922 --> 00:29:59,954
What's the other option?

550
00:30:00,174 --> 00:30:02,880
The other option is that we
keep Zoe on life support...

551
00:30:03,095 --> 00:30:05,420
...until we can deliver
the baby full-term.

552
00:30:07,266 --> 00:30:08,844
And what do you recommend?

553
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:11,100
I recommend the later delivery.

554
00:30:13,232 --> 00:30:15,984
You're suggesting that our daughter...

555
00:30:16,736 --> 00:30:19,228
...be made into a human incubator.

556
00:30:19,448 --> 00:30:22,402
Even though she has no
chance of recovery.

557
00:30:22,618 --> 00:30:24,113
It's the baby's best chance.

558
00:30:24,286 --> 00:30:28,949
I don't want to see Zoe left lying
there like some kind of vessel.

559
00:30:30,252 --> 00:30:33,123
She wanted this baby more
than anything in the world.

560
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:35,456
You have no say in this matter.

561
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:37,129
I'm the baby's father.

562
00:30:37,344 --> 00:30:40,346
I'm Zoe's father,
and you and she are minors.

563
00:30:40,557 --> 00:30:42,633
The decision...

564
00:30:42,851 --> 00:30:44,309
...is mine and her mother's.

565
00:30:44,979 --> 00:30:47,137
They can't do this, can they?

566
00:30:51,611 --> 00:30:53,734
I'm sorry it took us so long
to get to you.

567
00:30:53,947 --> 00:30:56,700
I understand.
I was just really freaked out.

568
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:59,579
It's not every day the room
you're in explodes.

569
00:30:59,788 --> 00:31:02,540
Understandable. Okay. You're all set.

570
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:06,084
Keep it elevated and dry, and come
back in two days for a re-check.

571
00:31:06,296 --> 00:31:07,459
- Okay?
- Yeah.

572
00:31:07,672 --> 00:31:09,666
You left your insurance form blank.

573
00:31:09,884 --> 00:31:12,007
Yeah. I left my card at home.

574
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:15,387
- Can you call someone to get it?
- No, I'll pay cash.

575
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:17,508
That's not necessary.
Your insurance will cover this.

576
00:31:17,685 --> 00:31:19,180
No, I know.
I just...

577
00:31:19,395 --> 00:31:22,765
...don't want my husband to know
I was at the clinic.

578
00:31:24,401 --> 00:31:28,186
I thought I was too old for
this kind of thing to happen.

579
00:31:28,406 --> 00:31:31,573
Then I started to puke up
corn flakes every morning.

580
00:31:31,785 --> 00:31:35,535
Now I have to find a new clinic.
Preferably one that is not ticking.

581
00:31:35,749 --> 00:31:38,370
- You haven't had the abortion?
- No.

582
00:31:38,877 --> 00:31:42,329
And if my husband finds out,
he just won't have the heart.

583
00:31:42,549 --> 00:31:46,168
Our youngest daughter's in college.
He put all four kids through college.

584
00:31:46,386 --> 00:31:48,842
He worked five years
past his retirement...

585
00:31:49,056 --> 00:31:50,800
...to be able to pay for it.

586
00:31:52,393 --> 00:31:54,517
I've never kept anything
from him, but-

587
00:31:54,729 --> 00:31:56,557
What if you told him
what you told me?

588
00:31:56,774 --> 00:31:58,684
I can't. I'd love to...

589
00:32:00,153 --> 00:32:01,565
...but I can't.

590
00:32:03,073 --> 00:32:04,734
Anyway, what do I owe you?

591
00:32:04,909 --> 00:32:07,068
Don't worry.
Bring your card tomorrow.

592
00:32:07,245 --> 00:32:10,116
I could leave a license
or something as collateral.

593
00:32:10,332 --> 00:32:13,251
- It's all right. I trust you.
- Thanks.

594
00:32:13,419 --> 00:32:15,543
If anybody asks...

595
00:32:16,548 --> 00:32:19,585
...you can get a laceration
like that from a dog bite.

596
00:32:24,432 --> 00:32:25,678
Have you seen Corday?

597
00:32:25,893 --> 00:32:27,850
She's still in O.R. 3
with Beaumont.

598
00:32:28,062 --> 00:32:29,260
Okay, thanks.

599
00:32:36,947 --> 00:32:38,526
She made it, huh?

600
00:32:40,452 --> 00:32:42,160
What's wrong? You okay?

601
00:32:42,996 --> 00:32:44,456
Yeah.

602
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:47,917
It was scary.

603
00:32:49,421 --> 00:32:53,669
You can put them back together,
but you can't keep them that way.

604
00:33:04,314 --> 00:33:08,644
Scotty always had such
great school spirit.

605
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:12,905
I think I can speak for
the whole team when I say...

606
00:33:13,117 --> 00:33:15,193
...we're really going to miss him.

607
00:33:23,045 --> 00:33:25,003
I was gonna sing a hymn.

608
00:33:25,841 --> 00:33:28,877
But as I'm sitting here,
thinking of Scott...

609
00:33:29,345 --> 00:33:31,468
...there's a song that he loved.

610
00:33:32,056 --> 00:33:34,512
And it'll always remind me of him.

611
00:34:05,639 --> 00:34:08,510
Zadro, I fancy seeing you
on the surgical floor.

612
00:34:08,684 --> 00:34:11,851
I wanted to tell you, we appreciate
what you did for Allison.

613
00:34:12,021 --> 00:34:13,432
She's a fighter.

614
00:34:13,649 --> 00:34:15,807
With a damn good guardian angel.

615
00:34:18,321 --> 00:34:19,352
Lizzie...

616
00:34:19,572 --> 00:34:23,950
...I want to apologize for when I
spoke during the Beaumont surgery.

617
00:34:24,161 --> 00:34:28,242
I know that she means a lot to you.
I just hope you forgive me.

618
00:34:28,458 --> 00:34:32,207
Of course. It's been
a crazy day for all of us.

619
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,206
I get off in about an hour.

620
00:34:34,382 --> 00:34:37,716
Do you want to get a drink?
Decompress?

621
00:34:38,345 --> 00:34:42,214
Look, I'm knackered.
Any other day. Okay?

622
00:34:42,433 --> 00:34:45,269
I understand. If you change your
mind, you have my number.

623
00:34:45,479 --> 00:34:46,808
Yes, I do.

624
00:34:51,903 --> 00:34:52,982
David?

625
00:34:54,573 --> 00:34:56,649
I forgot what this place
was all about.

626
00:34:56,868 --> 00:35:00,071
The teamwork.
The well-oiled machine.

627
00:35:00,288 --> 00:35:01,320
What?

628
00:35:03,792 --> 00:35:07,412
I've let this situation get
completely out of hand.

629
00:35:09,049 --> 00:35:11,719
I told myself the varices
were too friable.

630
00:35:11,927 --> 00:35:13,921
That my field was obscured.

631
00:35:14,138 --> 00:35:18,636
That I was protecting
Dr. Swanson's dignity. I wasn't.

632
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:21,179
I was covering my own ass.

633
00:35:22,983 --> 00:35:26,566
Look, if you make a mistake,
that's all that it is.

634
00:35:26,779 --> 00:35:28,938
No. No.

635
00:35:29,115 --> 00:35:30,989
It's more than that.

636
00:35:31,201 --> 00:35:32,861
What are you watching?

637
00:35:35,456 --> 00:35:38,826
What am I not watching?
That's the question.

638
00:35:40,962 --> 00:35:43,288
This is the tape of Swanson's
laparoscopy.

639
00:35:43,507 --> 00:35:44,919
Where did you get it?

640
00:35:45,135 --> 00:35:48,670
I took it right after the surgery.

641
00:35:49,264 --> 00:35:51,637
I've been too chicken to look at it.

642
00:35:53,269 --> 00:35:56,935
I guess I thought we could
avoid a confrontation.

643
00:35:57,149 --> 00:36:00,151
A resident can take a note
in his file, right?

644
00:36:00,361 --> 00:36:03,150
Peter's got so much less
to lose than-

645
00:36:06,244 --> 00:36:08,153
I can toss this right now.

646
00:36:08,329 --> 00:36:10,405
No one would be the wiser.

647
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:14,292
You wouldn't have called me if
that's what you were going to do.

648
00:36:35,863 --> 00:36:37,238
Jeanie?

649
00:36:38,032 --> 00:36:40,109
I wondered where you'd gotten to.

650
00:36:40,327 --> 00:36:43,411
I'm just sitting in here.
It's very peaceful.

651
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,865
Yes, it is.

652
00:36:48,336 --> 00:36:52,714
When Scotty was going through
the worst of it...

653
00:36:53,384 --> 00:36:57,465
...I went into his room.
Found his journal.

654
00:36:59,392 --> 00:37:01,848
I know I shouldn't have
looked at it...

655
00:37:03,062 --> 00:37:05,684
...but I wanted to understand him...

656
00:37:06,692 --> 00:37:10,525
...the way you and his mother
seemed to.

657
00:37:10,739 --> 00:37:12,150
He loved you very much.

658
00:37:16,579 --> 00:37:20,245
He said, "Jeanie just gets it.

659
00:37:20,459 --> 00:37:25,417
I don't have to explain anything to her,
because she already knows. "

660
00:37:27,593 --> 00:37:29,336
That's very sweet.

661
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:33,931
He told me what he wanted to be
when he grew up.

662
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:38,603
Some kind of rock 'n' roll star,
probably.

663
00:37:39,899 --> 00:37:41,691
He wanted to join the Army.

664
00:37:45,114 --> 00:37:46,395
He did?

665
00:38:00,799 --> 00:38:04,299
I paged OB. They'll send somebody
to discuss your options.

666
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:09,217
We've decided to keep the baby
and wait until it's closer to term.

667
00:38:10,311 --> 00:38:12,350
Good, I'm glad.
Donny will be glad too.

668
00:38:12,563 --> 00:38:15,316
This is no longer
any of Donny's business.

669
00:38:17,236 --> 00:38:18,778
Give it a little more time.

670
00:38:18,988 --> 00:38:23,485
I've contacted our attorney. My wife
and I are filing for sole custody.

671
00:38:24,912 --> 00:38:27,154
Is this to teach Donny a lesson?

672
00:38:27,665 --> 00:38:29,659
Nothing could teach him
what he deserves.

673
00:38:29,876 --> 00:38:31,454
I've seen parents twice his age...

674
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:34,078
...who weren't responsible
enough to seek care.

675
00:38:34,299 --> 00:38:37,918
Responsible? Getting
a 16-year-old girl pregnant.

676
00:38:38,136 --> 00:38:40,094
Forcing her to leave home.
Drop out of school-

677
00:38:40,306 --> 00:38:41,385
- Please, Miles.
- No.

678
00:38:41,558 --> 00:38:45,306
- The doctor thinks he's an expert.
- No, it's just-

679
00:38:46,479 --> 00:38:49,018
It's just what's best for the child.

680
00:38:49,191 --> 00:38:52,192
We let Donny into our lives once
and he took our daughter away.

681
00:38:52,403 --> 00:38:54,812
He's not gonna
take our granddaughter.

682
00:38:57,493 --> 00:38:59,782
- I don't want to go.
- Everything will be fine.

683
00:38:59,996 --> 00:39:01,538
This is for the best.

684
00:39:01,706 --> 00:39:03,035
I'm not sure it is.

685
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:06,204
You filed a legal report.
You can't rescind that.

686
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,213
I want to go home.
I want to go home.

687
00:39:08,423 --> 00:39:10,297
If you won't listen to me,
listen to him.

688
00:39:10,509 --> 00:39:14,211
Someone being abused can't always
determine the best course of action.

689
00:39:14,389 --> 00:39:16,049
This isn't a hypothetical.

690
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:19,261
This is an adult human being who's
deciding to go home.

691
00:39:19,478 --> 00:39:22,052
Your report said he was
non compos mentis.

692
00:39:22,232 --> 00:39:23,560
He was severely dehydrated.

693
00:39:23,734 --> 00:39:26,059
Once we ran fluids in him,
he's become lucid.

694
00:39:26,278 --> 00:39:27,986
Mr. Newton, I know you're scared.

695
00:39:28,197 --> 00:39:31,448
But I'm scared about what's going to
happen to you if you're not cared for.

696
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:35,990
I'm fine. Dr. Carter,
call Burke. He'll explain.

697
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,580
Don't force me to get
the police involved...

698
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:42,086
...and press charges against your
son and daughter-in-law.

699
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,371
Can she do that?

700
00:39:44,383 --> 00:39:47,587
- Please don't let her do that.
- I'm sorry.

701
00:39:47,804 --> 00:39:49,429
Don't let her do that!

702
00:39:49,681 --> 00:39:51,722
- I'm sorry!
- I want to go home!

703
00:39:53,937 --> 00:39:55,266
Kerry.

704
00:39:55,772 --> 00:39:57,017
Anna.

705
00:39:57,232 --> 00:40:00,150
What happened today, it threw me.
It's been on my mind.

706
00:40:00,361 --> 00:40:02,935
- I wanted to talk to you about it.
- Same here.

707
00:40:03,114 --> 00:40:07,065
I should have explained myself better
instead of flying off the handle.

708
00:40:07,286 --> 00:40:09,824
- You were right.
- No, just let me explain.

709
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:15,870
I did some overseas work in Africa
where abortion is illegal.

710
00:40:16,089 --> 00:40:20,633
And I saw 15-year-old girls
in septic shock...

711
00:40:20,803 --> 00:40:22,961
...from botched procedures.

712
00:40:23,181 --> 00:40:25,553
And there was nothing we could do.

713
00:40:25,767 --> 00:40:29,219
I've made it a priority to be
the best doctor I can be...

714
00:40:29,439 --> 00:40:31,764
...and to support all
my patients' choices.

715
00:40:31,982 --> 00:40:34,605
If you had asked me when I
got up this morning...

716
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,527
...I would've said the same thing.

717
00:40:36,738 --> 00:40:38,483
But in this case,
she was so far along.

718
00:40:38,866 --> 00:40:41,654
What if another Brianna Thomas
comes in?

719
00:40:43,997 --> 00:40:48,541
I'd love to be able to tell you that
if the same case came in tomorrow...

720
00:40:48,753 --> 00:40:52,704
...I'd do the procedure without
a second thought, but I don't know.

721
00:41:00,183 --> 00:41:04,016
Peter, I'm glad I caught you.
I was on my way to your apartment.

722
00:41:04,189 --> 00:41:07,392
I'm sorry about that surgery,
but I already had my hand in there.

723
00:41:07,609 --> 00:41:09,188
No, you did the right thing.

724
00:41:09,403 --> 00:41:13,104
You were thinking on your feet.
That's not what I want to talk about.

725
00:41:13,325 --> 00:41:17,538
I wanted to let you know that one of my
last two acts as Chief of Surgery...

726
00:41:17,705 --> 00:41:19,532
...is to rescind your suspension.

727
00:41:21,167 --> 00:41:22,365
What do you mean?

728
00:41:23,963 --> 00:41:27,332
That's Swanson's laparoscopy
in full living color.

729
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:29,460
The mistake wasn't yours.

730
00:41:29,678 --> 00:41:32,086
I cut the gastric artery.

731
00:41:32,557 --> 00:41:36,009
My last act as chief will be to resign.

732
00:41:39,064 --> 00:41:41,638
- It was just one incident.
- No.

733
00:41:42,819 --> 00:41:47,113
When I saw you in that trauma today,
the passion that you exhibited...

734
00:41:47,324 --> 00:41:49,946
...it's been years since I felt that.

735
00:41:50,161 --> 00:41:54,029
It might have something to do with
my heart attack. The pressure...

736
00:41:54,249 --> 00:41:57,619
...of feeling that I just
don't belong here anymore.

737
00:41:59,089 --> 00:42:01,759
What do you mean?
You're a great surgeon.

738
00:42:02,426 --> 00:42:04,466
You taught me everything I know.

739
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:08,931
I was a great surgeon.
But what happened...

740
00:42:09,101 --> 00:42:11,058
...what I allowed to happen...

741
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:13,940
...it just proves that I'm not
a very great man.

742
00:42:14,107 --> 00:42:16,432
That's what I gotta work on.

743
00:42:22,158 --> 00:42:23,190
Here.

744
00:42:24,328 --> 00:42:26,654
- You smell that?
- What's that?

745
00:42:26,872 --> 00:42:29,032
The smell of spring.

746
00:42:29,793 --> 00:42:32,960
All green, and full of possibility.

747
00:42:36,134 --> 00:42:38,707
Ramen Delight. You feeling suicidal?

748
00:42:38,929 --> 00:42:41,467
No, I'm just poor.

749
00:42:41,682 --> 00:42:43,591
John Truman Carter, poor?

750
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:47,974
It's a long story.
I've had a bit of a long week.

751
00:42:49,107 --> 00:42:53,153
I overdid it with a patient.
Thought I was doing what was best.

752
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:56,572
Better to overdo it and be wrong,
than not do anything at all.

753
00:42:56,784 --> 00:42:58,113
I'll tell you what.

754
00:42:58,328 --> 00:43:02,112
Dump that liquid sodium
and I'll buy you a burger and a beer.

755
00:43:02,332 --> 00:43:05,038
- I don't know.
- Come on. It's not an option.

756
00:43:05,253 --> 00:43:06,746
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Jeanie.

757
00:43:06,962 --> 00:43:08,161
Is it still raining?

758
00:43:08,339 --> 00:43:11,340
It's not so bad.
It's kind of nice, actually.

759
00:43:23,316 --> 00:43:24,347
Peter?

760
00:43:24,567 --> 00:43:26,809
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

761
00:43:27,697 --> 00:43:29,986
Come on in.
I'll turn the music down.

762
00:43:40,504 --> 00:43:42,994
- Let me take that.
- Oh...

763
00:43:43,215 --> 00:43:45,007
Here, look, you're soaking wet.

764
00:43:45,218 --> 00:43:47,009
Yeah. Cheap umbrella.

765
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:49,890
What possessed you to
come out in these elements?

766
00:43:50,348 --> 00:43:53,185
My day, my week, my life.

767
00:43:53,811 --> 00:43:57,228
I heard about Morgenstern.
I'm really sorry.

768
00:44:02,196 --> 00:44:04,604
I lost my mentor today.

769
00:44:05,701 --> 00:44:07,409
And the hospital...

770
00:44:09,288 --> 00:44:11,198
...they lost a great surgeon.

771
00:44:20,052 --> 00:44:22,377
You can be so close to somebody...

772
00:44:24,098 --> 00:44:26,008
...and then they're gone.

773
00:44:26,768 --> 00:44:31,016
And you've never even told them
that you- You know, how...

774
00:44:32,608 --> 00:44:33,984
What you-

775
00:44:34,694 --> 00:44:37,316
I'm sorry, I'm babbling.
I'm not making sense.
