1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,834
Oh, come on.

2
00:00:03,866 --> 00:00:05,685
That is the worst runway walk
i've ever seen.

3
00:00:05,685 --> 00:00:08,220
She's not fierce.
Eliminate her.

4
00:00:10,966 --> 00:00:12,367
Cooper, i told you,

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,986
When the models are walking,
do not call.

6
00:00:17,633 --> 00:00:18,852
Doug?

7
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:27,166
Doug?

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,899
Come upstairs.

9
00:00:28,933 --> 00:00:30,706
D- Doug? What's the-

10
00:00:30,706 --> 00:00:32,133
Upstairs.

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,233
What's going on?

12
00:00:34,266 --> 00:00:35,922
Where's karen?

13
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,380
Doug?

14
00:00:40,412 --> 00:00:42,007
She's in there.
K- Karen.

15
00:00:42,007 --> 00:00:43,729
She's been so sick,
so sick,

16
00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:47,683
And... oh, my god.
I didn't know who to call.

17
00:00:47,683 --> 00:00:50,896
You're still my therapist.
I... i didn't know who to call.

18
00:00:50,929 --> 00:00:53,596
Okay. It's gonna be
all right.

19
00:01:04,963 --> 00:01:06,675
Doug?

20
00:01:06,968 --> 00:01:08,698
I killed her.

21
00:01:09,857 --> 00:01:11,868
I killed my wife.

22
00:01:16,004 --> 00:01:17,803
Aah!

23
00:01:19,762 --> 00:01:21,261
You did that on purpose.

24
00:01:21,295 --> 00:01:22,662
Oh, come on, man.

25
00:01:22,695 --> 00:01:24,301
If you didn't suck,
you wouldn't get hit.

26
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:26,258
I don't suck.
I played on a team, man.

27
00:01:26,258 --> 00:01:28,050
You suck.
Oh, say that to my face.

28
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:30,724
I am saying it to your face.
You suck!

29
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:35,985
Oh, we need women.

30
00:01:35,985 --> 00:01:38,860
Word.
Oh. I hate racquetball.

31
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,132
Man, she's working
in our building.

32
00:01:40,132 --> 00:01:41,287
Charlotte is
working in the buildg.

33
00:01:41,287 --> 00:01:43,646
I can't get away from her. Well, naomi
- She's right down the hall.

34
00:01:43,646 --> 00:01:46,597
You think that's easy? You
know, i wish she would just die.

35
00:01:46,597 --> 00:01:50,315
Whoa. No, not in a bad way.
Just like... slightly dead.

36
00:01:50,315 --> 00:01:51,921
You know, then i wouldn't
have to see her face.

37
00:01:51,921 --> 00:01:55,031
She'd just be a memory. Yoever
wish naomi dead? Hey, man.

38
00:01:55,064 --> 00:01:58,410
That's... the mother of
my child. Yes, i do, actually.

39
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,593
When she had sex with that guy,
i wished she was dead.

40
00:02:01,593 --> 00:02:03,926
Yeah. All right, let's
go again. I got you.

41
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,559
Hold up.

42
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,803
What's up, violet?
She's calling you?

43
00:02:11,837 --> 00:02:13,609
She wouldn't let me call her
when the models are walking.

44
00:02:13,609 --> 00:02:17,545
Why is she calling you? Traitor.
Okay, i'll be right there.

45
00:02:17,649 --> 00:02:20,488
Just a few more notes to make.
Ten minutes tops.

46
00:02:20,488 --> 00:02:21,716
Don't worry about it.

47
00:02:21,749 --> 00:02:25,817
I figure i could get 5 miles in before bed.
You ran this morning, and you don't run.

48
00:02:25,817 --> 00:02:27,384
Who are you, and what
have you done with meg?

49
00:02:27,384 --> 00:02:30,109
I am bored.
I'm out-Of-My-Head bored.

50
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:31,537
I'm running bored.

51
00:02:31,537 --> 00:02:33,570
You know what i do all day?
Nothing.

52
00:02:33,603 --> 00:02:35,770
And after that, nothing,
and then a little more nothing.

53
00:02:35,804 --> 00:02:38,329
I mean, what do people do all
day who don't have jobs or kids?

54
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:39,759
'Cause i can't spend
all my time

55
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,341
Running around the
neighborhood. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

56
00:02:41,341 --> 00:02:44,571
My thighs are killing me. I'm
freaking out here. Hey, hey, hey.

57
00:02:44,571 --> 00:02:46,787
I know it's frustrating
being in a new place,

58
00:02:46,787 --> 00:02:47,912
Trying to figure out
where you fit in,

59
00:02:47,912 --> 00:02:52,251
But don't run. You
know, get a job. A job?

60
00:02:52,251 --> 00:02:53,184
Yeah.

61
00:02:53,217 --> 00:02:54,718
Now why don't we...

62
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,684
hurt your thighs
a little more...

63
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,917
in a non-Running way?

64
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:05,517
I'm going home.

65
00:03:05,551 --> 00:03:08,351
You're not going home.
I- I don't want to-Just-

66
00:03:08,384 --> 00:03:10,572
Would you just stop bathing me
like i'm an invalid?

67
00:03:10,572 --> 00:03:13,041
You got shot. You want to be
both shot and dirty?

68
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:15,270
I'm serious. I don't want
to be your responsibility.

69
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,551
I don't want to be...
i don't want to be a burden.

70
00:03:18,584 --> 00:03:21,205
You're not a burden.
Kevin, look at me.

71
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,640
You're not a burden.

72
00:03:24,117 --> 00:03:26,423
Let me take care of you.

73
00:03:29,101 --> 00:03:31,015
Karen was out of her head
with the pain.

74
00:03:31,015 --> 00:03:33,555
The blood-She was always
spitting up blood.

75
00:03:33,555 --> 00:03:35,389
Her condition was fatal.
You know that.

76
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:39,647
And-And she was begging me
to help her, so i just... i did.

77
00:03:39,647 --> 00:03:42,206
I helped her. All right,
karen was sick for months,

78
00:03:42,206 --> 00:03:43,885
And i know that she was dying,
but there were

79
00:03:43,885 --> 00:03:46,852
So many other ways that you
could've helped her-

80
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,886
Palliative care, pain
management. She didn't want that.

81
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:52,669
She-She was done.
She just wanted to go.

82
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:55,876
So you shot her in the head?
Sam, doug s been through a trauma.

83
00:03:55,876 --> 00:03:57,461
They had a troubled marriage.

84
00:03:57,461 --> 00:04:00,474
He said he was gonna leave her
before i diagnosed her.

85
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:03,976
Karen was... she was
helpless. It's not like that.

86
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:05,517
Time to go.

87
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:10,909
I was only trying
to help her.

88
00:04:12,276 --> 00:04:14,575
So you're his shrink,
and, uh, who are you?

89
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:17,738
Dr. Bennett is-
Was karen's doctor.

90
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:19,609
Karen was suffering
from kidney failure

91
00:04:19,642 --> 00:04:21,784
Secondary
to wegener's disease.

92
00:04:21,784 --> 00:04:23,160
Yeah, she was sick.
I get it.

93
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,198
Did he ever talk about hurting his wife,
wanting her dead? Uh, well, i-When we-

94
00:04:26,198 --> 00:04:30,209
Well, whatever he said is privileged.
So you're okay protecting a murderer?

95
00:04:30,243 --> 00:04:33,376
I'm protecting my patient. What about
you, dr. Bennett? You gonna stay silent,

96
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,516
Or are you gonna protect
your patient-Karen?

97
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:37,609
We're leaving.
Um-

98
00:04:37,642 --> 00:04:39,143
Sam.

The elevator's mine.

101
00:04:53,109 --> 00:04:55,353
You can have the fourth floor,
but the elevator's mine.

102
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:58,609
You can take the stairs. I'll give
you one more day to calm yourself down,

103
00:04:58,642 --> 00:05:01,542
Then we're gonna discuss this
like grown adults.

104
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,980
Tell you what, charlotte,
go to hell.

105
00:05:07,913 --> 00:05:12,363
Oh, my god. He shot her?
Wait, he shot her shot her?

106
00:05:12,363 --> 00:05:14,583
As in killed her shot her. Killed who?

107
00:05:14,765 --> 00:05:16,732
Doug adams murdered
his wife last night.

108
00:05:16,765 --> 00:05:18,139
He-He did not murder her.

109
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:22,533
He said she begged him to do it. Oh,
god, that poor man. That poor woman.

110
00:05:22,566 --> 00:05:25,832
Then it was a mercy kiing? Yes,
yes. Dell gets it. It was euthanasia.

111
00:05:25,865 --> 00:05:29,020
It was a bullet to the brain.
Look, i-I know doug,

112
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,208
And he is not the type to-
There is no type.

113
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:33,232
Regular normal people are
driven to murder eve day.

114
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,399
Right? Love?
Love will do it every time.

115
00:05:35,432 --> 00:05:37,876
Twisted, sick,
messed up love...

116
00:05:39,262 --> 00:05:40,561
cooper...

117
00:05:40,595 --> 00:05:42,714
charlotte king
is still alive, right?

118
00:05:42,714 --> 00:05:45,719
I'm just saying,
the impulse-We all have it.

119
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:47,981
Hey. Hey, i didn't know
you were coming here.

120
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:50,213
Uh, can i talk to you? Yeah,
sure, give me one second.

121
00:05:50,213 --> 00:05:52,135
Not you. You.

122
00:06:01,748 --> 00:06:04,416
What did i tell you
about the elevator? I...

123
00:06:05,515 --> 00:06:07,873
<i>i'm not talking to you.</i>

124
00:06:10,448 --> 00:06:12,043
Oh, yay. My day is made.

125
00:06:12,043 --> 00:06:14,348
I need a favor, montgomery.
Oh, that's rich.

126
00:06:14,382 --> 00:06:15,909
You open a practice
right underneath us,

127
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:18,782
And you need a favor from us? I'm not
coming to you from pacific wellcare.

128
00:06:18,815 --> 00:06:21,567
As chief at the hospital where
you retain surgical privileges,

129
00:06:21,567 --> 00:06:23,529
I'm hoping we can be civil.
What is it?

130
00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:28,730
No, don't engage. Breathe,
cooper. I can be civil. What is it?

131
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,248
Alena degray,
full-Term pregnancy.

132
00:06:36,281 --> 00:06:38,747
Eight months ago,
she was in a car accident.

133
00:06:38,803 --> 00:06:41,382
Doctors did everything
they could, but...

134
00:06:41,415 --> 00:06:44,181
she's comatose.
And in an early labor.

135
00:06:44,215 --> 00:06:45,709
Okay.

136
00:06:47,742 --> 00:06:50,509
Uh, alena,
she just, uh, moaned.

137
00:06:50,542 --> 00:06:52,905
That's good, right?

138
00:06:52,905 --> 00:06:55,742
She hasn't done that
since right after the accident.

139
00:06:56,276 --> 00:06:59,059
Moaning is a good sign that
she's starting to respond.

140
00:06:59,059 --> 00:07:01,063
I think it's just
a sign of labor.

141
00:07:01,063 --> 00:07:03,136
Sean,
the neurologist told you,

142
00:07:03,136 --> 00:07:04,817
She's nonresponsive.

143
00:07:04,817 --> 00:07:07,169
She wants this baby so much.

144
00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:09,127
We found out she was pregnant

145
00:07:09,127 --> 00:07:11,150
The day before
the car accident.

146
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:14,561
I think it was the happiest day of her
life. The baby's in a breech position.

147
00:07:14,561 --> 00:07:17,921
Our o.B. Tried e.C.V. To try to turn e baby, but
- She's down too low.

148
00:07:17,921 --> 00:07:20,290
I need to do a c-Section.
You wanna book an o.R.?

149
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,876
No. She needs
to go through labor.

150
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:26,675
She needs to deliver this baby herself.
Sean, she can't. The breech position

151
00:07:26,675 --> 00:07:28,651
Puts the baby at risk
for a prolapsed cord,

152
00:07:28,651 --> 00:07:31,024
Which would cut off
the baby's oxygen supply.

153
00:07:31,024 --> 00:07:32,191
The head could get trapped,

154
00:07:32,191 --> 00:07:34,626
Potentially causing
brain injury or worse.

155
00:07:34,626 --> 00:07:36,896
Yeah, a woman in kentucky,
situation just like alena,

156
00:07:36,896 --> 00:07:39,029
Having the baby,
it woke her.

157
00:07:39,076 --> 00:07:43,068
Alena needs to deliver this baby
naturally, on her own.

158
00:07:43,068 --> 00:07:46,358
She has to.
Alena is going to wake up.

159
00:07:47,475 --> 00:07:49,380
And we're gonna be
a family again.

He sat here every day.
He wants her back.

164

She's not waking up, charlotte.
"Rip van winkle's" a fairy tale.

Don't tell me
you're going sentimental.

00:08:09,562 --> 00:08:12,562
Hardly. Just...
i find him touching.

167
00:08:12,562 --> 00:08:15,298
I need to do a c-Section.
I need to get the baby out now,

168
00:08:15,298 --> 00:08:18,086
Or both mom and baby could
die. We can't make him.

169
00:08:18,086 --> 00:08:20,184
We can't force him
to let us cut her open.

170
00:08:20,184 --> 00:08:24,119
Look, maybe if you talk to him,
get to know him.

171
00:08:24,186 --> 00:08:26,319
He warms up to you, and then
you help him understand-

172
00:08:26,386 --> 00:08:28,807
No, that's your job, charlotte,
as chief of staff.

173
00:08:28,807 --> 00:08:32,019
My job as consult is to get the baby
out. I have a practice to get back to.

174
00:08:32,086 --> 00:08:33,508
So do i.

175
00:08:36,837 --> 00:08:38,170
We...

176
00:08:38,237 --> 00:08:40,526
have to work together
to help that family.

177
00:08:40,526 --> 00:08:43,399
Yes, we do.
I'll put her on terbutaline

178
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:44,837
To temporarily stop
the contractions,

179
00:08:44,837 --> 00:08:47,572
But that'll only get you through the
end of the day. I'll consult legal.

180
00:08:47,572 --> 00:08:49,610
See if there's any way
we can override the father

181
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,785
And do the "c" without consent. Okay.

182
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,418
Okay.

183
00:08:56,971 --> 00:08:59,704
He could've left,
and he didn't. Why now?

184
00:08:59,771 --> 00:09:02,561
She was gonna die in what,
in six weeks, three months?

185
00:09:02,561 --> 00:09:05,871
You think after years and years
and years of this marriage,

186
00:09:05,937 --> 00:09:07,524
He would sot her now?

187
00:09:07,524 --> 00:09:09,820
They had a volatile
relationship, all right?

188
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,907
Now you may have seen his side,
but i saw hers.

189
00:09:12,907 --> 00:09:15,387
And she...
she was not suicidal.

190
00:09:15,387 --> 00:09:16,618
Well,
doug was not homicidal.

191
00:09:16,618 --> 00:09:18,937
Except for the gun
in his hand.

192
00:09:19,004 --> 00:09:20,722
I... i don't think
it was like that.

193
00:09:20,722 --> 00:09:23,450
Well, the cops are gonna want
a statement from both of us,

194
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:26,132
And i'm gonna tell the truth.

195
00:09:26,671 --> 00:09:29,622
Well, if doug gives me
permission to talk to them,

196
00:09:29,622 --> 00:09:30,937
So am i.

197
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:32,205
The actual truth

198
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:33,948
Or the truth
that you want to believe?

199
00:09:39,771 --> 00:09:41,204
No. No.

200
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,785
It's-No, it really-
It's fantastic.

201
00:09:43,785 --> 00:09:46,198
I'm serious.
What's going on?

202
00:09:46,198 --> 00:09:47,904
I like her, pete.

203
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,176
I went down to
the venice family clinic today

204
00:09:50,176 --> 00:09:51,619
To offer my services.

205
00:09:51,619 --> 00:09:53,907
Turns out they have
a huge overflow of patients,

206
00:09:53,907 --> 00:09:55,966
But not enough exam rooms,
but with naomi's help,

207
00:09:55,966 --> 00:09:57,533
We found some room here.

208
00:09:57,673 --> 00:10:01,153
He-Here at-
At oceanside wellness?

209
00:10:01,153 --> 00:10:02,435
Yeah, when the clinic
has too many patients,

210
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,844
I'll see 'em here. Addison's
always talking about how,

211
00:10:04,844 --> 00:10:06,387
With charlotte's practice
opening,

212
00:10:06,387 --> 00:10:08,127
We need to expand
our community outreach

213
00:10:08,127 --> 00:10:11,372
And raise our profile.
Meg is the perfect liaison.

214
00:10:11,372 --> 00:10:13,467
Plus, she's willing
to let dell shadow.

215
00:10:13,467 --> 00:10:16,294
Oceanside wellness gets to
generate possible future income,

216
00:10:16,294 --> 00:10:17,940
And i get to avoid
going stir crazy.

217
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,141
Everyone wins.
Welcome aboard, meg.

218
00:10:20,141 --> 00:10:21,485
Thank you.

219
00:10:25,437 --> 00:10:28,848
All right, i have to go
find dell and get set up.

220
00:10:28,883 --> 00:10:30,023
See you later?

221
00:10:30,023 --> 00:10:31,114
Yeah.

222
00:10:40,337 --> 00:10:41,633
Sorry.

223
00:10:46,795 --> 00:10:48,737
Is it always this slow?

224
00:10:48,804 --> 00:10:50,894
Only when someone stops it.

225
00:10:58,103 --> 00:10:59,216
Are you okay?

226
00:10:59,216 --> 00:11:00,735
You're not claustrophobic,
are you?

227
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:03,331
No, just impatient
and in a bad mood.

228
00:11:03,331 --> 00:11:05,215
Anything i can do?

229
00:11:08,373 --> 00:11:11,737
Occupational hazard.
I'm a therapist.

230
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:13,919
And to be honest,
i'm a bit nervous.

231
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:16,604
Interviewing for a new job,
you know? So...

232
00:11:16,671 --> 00:11:19,234
on the fourth floor?
Yes, you work there?

233
00:11:19,234 --> 00:11:21,970
Uh, no. I pushed 5,
remember?

234
00:11:22,037 --> 00:11:23,392
Right.

235
00:11:23,671 --> 00:11:25,785
Well, if you need to talk,
if there's anything i can do.

236
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:28,461
You know, i'm a shrink, too.
I think i can handle it.

237
00:11:30,704 --> 00:11:32,784
Oh, i'm shel-

238
00:11:33,467 --> 00:11:35,165
I'm sheldon wallace.

239
00:11:39,404 --> 00:11:40,914
Is there anything else
you need?

240
00:11:40,914 --> 00:11:43,247
Uh, no. This is perfect.
Better than i'm used to.

241
00:11:43,247 --> 00:11:45,829
Can i just say, dr. Porter, that, um
- Meg, please.

242
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:49,750
Meg, i-I just know i'm gonna learn so much working with
you. Well, i bet you could teach me a few tngs, too.

243
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,845
Candy stash-
Under the microwave.

244
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:54,237
See?
That's critical information.

245
00:11:54,304 --> 00:11:56,123
Well, dell, it looks like
our first patient together

246
00:11:56,123 --> 00:11:58,269
Is renee olsen.
Okay.

247
00:11:59,804 --> 00:12:01,938
Mr. Downs?
Yes.

248
00:12:02,003 --> 00:12:03,471
Renee olsen?

249
00:12:03,471 --> 00:12:04,804
Yes.

250
00:12:04,871 --> 00:12:05,804
Hi.

251
00:12:05,871 --> 00:12:07,304
Hi.
I'm dell parker.

252
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,737
Hi.
Hi.

253
00:12:08,804 --> 00:12:10,733
Um, i was referred
to dr. Porter

254
00:12:10,733 --> 00:12:13,520
For, um...
termination.

255
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,204
I'm sorry?
Termination.

256
00:12:16,522 --> 00:12:18,236
Abortion?

257
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:21,095
It's not like i don't want her here. I just don't
- Want her here.

258
00:12:21,095 --> 00:12:24,004
She just did it. She didn't
even ask me. Welcome to my world.

259
00:12:24,004 --> 00:12:26,700
It's not like she went behind my back. She just
- Went behind your back.

260
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,401
No. Stop finishing
my sentences.

261
00:12:28,401 --> 00:12:30,372
You know, she's a good doctor.
She's gonna be fine.

262
00:12:30,372 --> 00:12:33,232
Hey, did anybody know meg
was gonna be doing abortions?

263
00:12:33,704 --> 00:12:35,903
No. Look, i-I know i'm not
a partner in this practice,

264
00:12:35,903 --> 00:12:37,491
And you guys might all be okay
with this, but i want to go

265
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:39,622
On the record for saying that
i'm not. Not okay with what?

266
00:12:39,622 --> 00:12:43,716
Meg working here. Oh, yeah. Nal told
me. Pro bono clinic. I think it's great.

267
00:12:43,716 --> 00:12:45,917
She's doing abortions.
And?

268
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,871
Wait, you men
have a problem with it?

269
00:12:49,938 --> 00:12:53,399
No, not as men. We respect the choice, but i think
- I don't.

270
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:56,074
Um, i'm not commenting.
We just didn't know.

271
00:12:56,074 --> 00:12:57,163
You didn't know what?

272
00:12:57,163 --> 00:12:59,471
Meg's doing abortions here.
She's what?

273
00:12:59,471 --> 00:13:02,078
Hey. Nice digs you got
in those exam rooms.

274
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:04,243
They're palatial
compared to grass huts.

275
00:13:05,425 --> 00:13:08,080
What? You should've told us you
were gonna be doing abortions.

276
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,704
That's all. Okay, everyby
without a vagina, leave the room

277
00:13:10,704 --> 00:13:12,726
Unless you want to fight
with me.

278
00:13:16,345 --> 00:13:17,741
This is a problem?

279
00:13:17,741 --> 00:13:19,506
No.
I run a fertility clinic.

280
00:13:19,506 --> 00:13:21,955
And i'm in the business of
helping women to get pregnant,

281
00:13:21,955 --> 00:13:23,940
Not
- Whoa. Wait. Abortion is legal

282
00:13:24,007 --> 00:13:26,837
In the united states of america,
naomi. Are you against choice?

283
00:13:26,837 --> 00:13:28,738
<i>I am not gonna argue
roe v. Wade with you.</i>

284
00:13:28,738 --> 00:13:30,744
I am just saying,
they have never been done here

285
00:13:30,744 --> 00:13:34,785
And they should never be done here. It's a
valid medical procedure for women in need.

286
00:13:34,785 --> 00:13:37,305
Not for me,
and not for this practice.

287
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,906
I'm sorry. Uh...
i have to run.

288
00:13:40,973 --> 00:13:43,030
Addison. I don't have a problem with it.

289
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,421
We said she could work here.
She can work here.

290
00:13:56,894 --> 00:13:58,273
I'm ready for renee.

291
00:13:58,423 --> 00:13:59,857
She's gone.

292
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,456
What? Where?

293
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:02,483
I don't know where.

294
00:14:02,483 --> 00:14:04,227
I just know that
she's not coming back.

295
00:14:04,731 --> 00:14:07,060
Well, what happened?
Is she okay?

296
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:10,505
Except for the part about her planning to kill her baby. Y
- You talked her out of it?

297
00:14:10,505 --> 00:14:12,566
I just told her
what i thought, okay?

298
00:14:12,566 --> 00:14:14,036
I have work to do.

299
00:14:21,656 --> 00:14:23,690
Sean, i got a message
that you're ready

300
00:14:23,757 --> 00:14:26,541
For me to do the c-Section.
I told you no. I meant no.

301
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:29,663
We want you to do the c-Section.
These are alena's parents.

302
00:14:29,663 --> 00:14:31,858
I called them after i had legal
do some checking.

303
00:14:31,858 --> 00:14:34,208
Turns out sean and alena
are not married.

304
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:37,488
He has no right to make decisions on
her behalf. We were gonna get married

305
00:14:37,488 --> 00:14:39,388
Right after we found out
about the baby.

306
00:14:39,455 --> 00:14:42,688
I mean, just because we
didn't... i am still family.

307
00:14:42,755 --> 00:14:44,889
Don't you think
we want her back?

308
00:14:44,954 --> 00:14:49,797
But she's not waking up. If you need to do
a c-Section to help the baby, then do it.

309
00:14:49,797 --> 00:14:51,124
No.

310
00:14:52,982 --> 00:14:55,049
The parents have
the legal authority.

311
00:14:56,434 --> 00:14:58,849
I will schedule a c-Section
for this afternoon.

312
00:14:58,915 --> 00:15:00,216
Oh.

313
00:15:07,716 --> 00:15:10,689
Dell shamed a young woman
for wanting an abortion.

314
00:15:10,689 --> 00:15:12,532
You offered abortions
to patients

315
00:15:12,532 --> 00:15:14,718
Without consulting
anyone else. I'm a doctor.

316
00:15:14,718 --> 00:15:16,845
I don't need to consult
anyone about my medical care.

317
00:15:16,845 --> 00:15:18,794
You're a doctor who's working
with six other doctors

318
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:20,576
Who have opinions
about cases

319
00:15:20,576 --> 00:15:22,534
And about the reputation
of their practice.

320
00:15:22,534 --> 00:15:24,225
I- I'm screwing up
your reputation?

321
00:15:24,225 --> 00:15:27,627
That's what this is about? You completely
disregarded everyone else who works here.

322
00:15:27,661 --> 00:15:31,227
So, yes, that does reflect
on me. This is my domain.

323
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,673
Fine. I'll go.

324
00:15:48,452 --> 00:15:49,958
It's off.

325
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,825
Baby daddy went to court
to get an injunction

326
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,400
As guardian over the baby.

327
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,329
Not gonna be any surgery,
not today.

328
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,559
What? No, the patient is
prepped and ready to go.

329
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:01,758
Damn it.
So what next?

330
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,758
I'll see
if i can convince a judge

331
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,790
To get over here
and clear this up.

332
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:08,274
Yeah, if the baby lives
long enough.

333
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,523
Can i ask you?

334
00:16:10,523 --> 00:16:11,757
What?

335
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:13,457
Cooper.

336
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:15,156
You betrayed him, charlotte.

337
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:17,255
So how long is he gonna
make me pay for my crime?

338
00:16:17,255 --> 00:16:20,690
He's angry. I don't see that
ending anytime soon.

339
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,590
Yeah. Okay.

340
00:16:23,623 --> 00:16:24,923
Yeah.

341
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,139
You're in love with him.

342
00:16:28,173 --> 00:16:30,929
I am not. I just...

343
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,235
i am not.

344
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:37,274
This doesn't make us friends.
We're not friends, montgomery.

345
00:16:37,274 --> 00:16:38,541
Don't go getting any ideas.

346
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,756
I have no intention
of being friends with you.

347
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:47,019
They're saying
i murdered her.

348
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:50,926
I didn't.
I helped end her pain.

349
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:53,663
Sam says...
he thinks-

350
00:16:53,663 --> 00:16:56,334
When was the last time
sam saw her, two weeks ago?

351
00:16:56,334 --> 00:16:58,729
A- And for what,
maybe half an hour?

352
00:16:59,067 --> 00:17:02,291
He didn't see how walking up
a flight of stairs

353
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:03,778
Got to be
more than she could take.

354
00:17:03,778 --> 00:17:04,857
I did.

355
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:08,734
<i>I had to listen to her moan
in pain when the drugs wore off</i>

356
00:17:08,767 --> 00:17:10,701
And panic
'cause i thought maybe

357
00:17:10,734 --> 00:17:12,734
She had died
from a nosebleed.

358
00:17:12,767 --> 00:17:14,413
Well, there were
other options, doug.

359
00:17:14,413 --> 00:17:16,515
I did what she wanted.

360
00:17:16,653 --> 00:17:22,100
Look... i know karen and i
had a lousy marriage.

361
00:17:22,133 --> 00:17:25,351
I don't even know
if i loved her by the end.

362
00:17:27,409 --> 00:17:30,000
But i did care about her.

363
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,299
I just wish
you had called me first.

364
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:34,539
We could've talked about it.

365
00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:37,327
My lawyer says they're going
for first-Degree murder.

366
00:17:37,397 --> 00:17:41,518
I can't... do you know
what it's like in here?

367
00:17:41,681 --> 00:17:46,033
Please. Please help me.

368
00:17:46,067 --> 00:17:48,334
I waive all privilege.

369
00:17:48,855 --> 00:17:50,866
Whatever it takes.
Just tell them.

370
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,833
Tell the police...

371
00:17:52,866 --> 00:17:55,703
tell them
i didn't murder her.

372
00:17:58,033 --> 00:18:00,815
Dr. Turner, you know me.

373
00:18:00,815 --> 00:18:03,600
Do you think i murdered her?

374
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,892
Meg?

375
00:18:31,918 --> 00:18:33,526
Hey, is it true that pete
found out that

376
00:18:33,526 --> 00:18:35,914
Meg was doing abortions and
asked her to leave? Not exactly.

377
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:38,147
'Cause if that is true,
that is ridiculous.

378
00:18:38,181 --> 00:18:42,069
What, pete asking her to leave,
or doing the abortions? Pete.

379
00:18:42,069 --> 00:18:43,883
Oh. Well, don't tell
me you have a problem

380
00:18:43,883 --> 00:18:45,515
With meg doing the abortions. Naomi-

381
00:18:45,515 --> 00:18:48,217
What? I spend all day every day
trying to help women make babies

382
00:18:48,217 --> 00:18:52,603
Who-Who stopped believing that they ever could.
I can't believe this is such an issue for you.

383
00:18:53,095 --> 00:18:56,721
I... wish that i had known
a doctor like meg

384
00:18:56,721 --> 00:19:00,886
Or a place like our practice
when i needed an abortion.

385
00:19:02,095 --> 00:19:03,961
I had two.

386
00:19:04,436 --> 00:19:08,155
I had
a very... misspent youth.

387
00:19:08,155 --> 00:19:09,616
I made some mistakes.

388
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:11,237
You don't have to tell us.

389
00:19:11,237 --> 00:19:14,257
I wasn't going to,
but i'm not ashamed.

390
00:19:14,257 --> 00:19:15,937
I was.

391
00:19:16,154 --> 00:19:17,574
I had one.

392
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:21,206
And i was embarrassed
and scared.

393
00:19:22,006 --> 00:19:24,494
I was everything
a woman shouldn't be.

394
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:27,850
Well, i fertilize eggs
every day,

395
00:19:27,883 --> 00:19:30,927
And i believe that life
begins at conception.

396
00:19:30,927 --> 00:19:33,333
Oh, so what, it's murder?
I believe what i believe.

397
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,157
Well, i believe that things
aren't so black-And-White.

398
00:19:35,157 --> 00:19:37,622
Well, you know, you don't do what
i do. No, i deal with the aftermath.

399
00:19:37,622 --> 00:19:42,479
I deal with women who've had children who shouldn't
have. Maybe we should talk about something else.

400
00:19:54,817 --> 00:19:56,848
What are you doing here?

401
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:01,948
I just thought y might be
in the mood for a drink

402
00:20:01,948 --> 00:20:03,665
After a hard day
at the office.

403
00:20:03,665 --> 00:20:05,583
No, thanks.
Cooper-

404
00:20:05,616 --> 00:20:07,954
Get out from in front
of my door.

405
00:20:11,982 --> 00:20:13,658
Move.

406
00:20:20,516 --> 00:20:22,749
I'm sorry, okay?

407
00:20:23,283 --> 00:20:25,195
I'm sorry.

408
00:20:25,883 --> 00:20:27,616
I'll do the time.

409
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:31,193
Whatever you want,
i'll do the time.

410
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,453
But i am sorry.

411
00:20:33,783 --> 00:20:36,583
Just... go home.

412
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,353
I needed time...

413
00:21:04,384 --> 00:21:06,083
to think.

414
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:08,598
So i thought
in my hotel room

415
00:21:08,631 --> 00:21:12,131
With the crisp white sheets
and the travel-Sized toiletries.

416
00:21:12,164 --> 00:21:13,319
You didn't have to do that.

417
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:15,821
You have two modes-
Off and on-

418
00:21:15,821 --> 00:21:17,523
And when you're off...

419
00:21:18,164 --> 00:21:19,998
peter, you get cold.

420
00:21:20,032 --> 00:21:21,631
You're closed,
you're shut down.

421
00:21:21,665 --> 00:21:22,833
It's like
you're punishing me

422
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,817
For something
that i didn't do.

423
00:21:25,185 --> 00:21:27,121
You never
used to be like this.

424
00:21:27,121 --> 00:21:31,215
The man i knew...
we used to share everything.

425
00:21:34,164 --> 00:21:35,831
So what happened?

426
00:21:35,865 --> 00:21:38,148
What happened to you
between then and now?

427
00:21:40,865 --> 00:21:42,431
The clinic is good.

428
00:21:42,464 --> 00:21:44,565
What you do for people
is good.

429
00:21:44,598 --> 00:21:46,879
I overreacted.

430
00:21:49,131 --> 00:21:50,769
Come back.

431
00:22:01,205 --> 00:22:02,298
Good morning.

432
00:22:02,331 --> 00:22:03,902
Not so good.

433
00:22:03,902 --> 00:22:05,481
The district attorney's
gonna subpoena

434
00:22:05,481 --> 00:22:07,814
Karen's medical records.
You okay?

435
00:22:07,814 --> 00:22:09,802
I was up all night
trying to figure this out.

436
00:22:09,802 --> 00:22:11,037
And i-I cannot get the image

437
00:22:11,037 --> 00:22:13,033
Of doug with that gun
in his hand out of my head.

438
00:22:13,033 --> 00:22:17,153
So then you do think it's possible that
- No. I don'know. No.

439
00:22:17,153 --> 00:22:20,235
I just... i wish there was
somebody i could talk to,

440
00:22:20,235 --> 00:22:21,570
Somebody who knows about
this kind of thing.

441
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:24,886
I'm kind of in
uncharted waters here.

442
00:22:26,131 --> 00:22:29,598
I think i know
someone you could talk to.

443
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:34,698
Sit down.

444
00:22:36,464 --> 00:22:37,731
Sorry.

445
00:22:37,765 --> 00:22:40,052
I don't mean to bother you
while you're recovering.

446
00:22:40,052 --> 00:22:42,170
Oh, please... bother me.

447
00:22:42,631 --> 00:22:45,792
So, uh, doug adams
killed his wife.

448
00:22:45,884 --> 00:22:49,398
How do i know if it's murder
or assisted suicide?

449
00:22:49,431 --> 00:22:51,398
Doug has had no difficulty
with impulsivity

450
00:22:51,431 --> 00:22:53,515
Or anger control
his entire life.

451
00:22:53,515 --> 00:22:55,598
He was submissive to his wife.

452
00:22:55,631 --> 00:22:59,398
I've never found any indication
that he was remotely violent.

453
00:22:59,431 --> 00:23:01,096
I- I-In fact,

454
00:23:01,096 --> 00:23:03,446
I- I would be hard-Pressed
to concoct a scenario

455
00:23:03,446 --> 00:23:05,993
In which he had the temerity
to strike out against his wife

456
00:23:05,993 --> 00:23:07,867
Unless she instructed him.

457
00:23:07,867 --> 00:23:09,331
You don't think
he got scared to leave

458
00:23:09,331 --> 00:23:10,863
And took the easy way out?

459
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,880
Killing karen would never be
the easy way out for him.

460
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,107
I... i-I just don't think

461
00:23:17,107 --> 00:23:20,865
Doug murdered his wife
in cold blood.

462
00:23:20,898 --> 00:23:22,173
In all my years on the force,

463
00:23:22,173 --> 00:23:24,102
Do you know how many women
i've seen kill themselves

464
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:26,608
Or asked to killed
with a gun?

465
00:23:26,949 --> 00:23:28,289
None.

466
00:23:32,298 --> 00:23:34,889
What's best for the child
is to have a mother.

467
00:23:34,889 --> 00:23:38,383
What's best for the child is to
be alive. I will not hear shouting.

468
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:40,464
You want me to defer this
to the courtroom?

469
00:23:40,498 --> 00:23:41,841
We can put the attorneys
together

470
00:23:41,841 --> 00:23:44,583
And have them drag it out
until it's too late.

471
00:23:44,936 --> 00:23:47,994
I want to hear from you.
The baby's in imminent danger.

472
00:23:47,994 --> 00:23:51,694
If i do nothing, it could suffer
irreversible complications.

473
00:23:51,694 --> 00:23:55,149
And the hospital's position?
You support dr. Montgomery?

474
00:23:55,149 --> 00:23:57,364
We want to give alena
every chance.

475
00:23:57,398 --> 00:24:00,731
That said, judge,
we don't dispute dr. Montgomery.

476
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:02,109
It is her only chance.

477
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:04,976
Sean, alena is our daughter.

478
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:08,724
If we thought for one minute
we could have her back...

479
00:24:08,765 --> 00:24:10,765
i have two choices, sean.

480
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:12,598
I can rule on this,

481
00:24:12,631 --> 00:24:15,106
Or you can withdraw
your objection.

482
00:24:15,106 --> 00:24:17,429
I'd rather it come from you.

483
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:28,784
You look like
you're in a hurry.

484
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,831
Thanks.

485
00:24:33,164 --> 00:24:34,980
Look, i'm-I'm sorry
about yesterday.

486
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:39,264
Ah, we all have bad days.
Today any better?

487
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,231
Actually, no.

488
00:24:41,695 --> 00:24:43,620
I don't suppose
you want to talk about it.

489
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,187
Yeah, it's complicated.

490
00:24:45,787 --> 00:24:47,264
Transference?

491
00:24:47,632 --> 00:24:49,207
Psychosis?

492
00:24:49,545 --> 00:24:51,158
I'm kidding.

493
00:24:51,392 --> 00:24:54,028
Murder. Or manslaughter.

494
00:24:54,028 --> 00:24:56,698
Wow. That's... big.

495
00:24:56,731 --> 00:24:58,373
You must be good.

496
00:24:58,373 --> 00:25:01,075
Yeah. You'd think.

497
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:04,333
You know the best way
to cheer yourself up?

498
00:25:04,857 --> 00:25:09,264
Cheer someone else up. Oh, is...
is that your brand of therapy?

499
00:25:09,298 --> 00:25:12,831
What is that, jung or freud,
or, uh, or fortune cookies?

500
00:25:12,865 --> 00:25:14,731
It's mark twain, actually.

501
00:25:14,765 --> 00:25:16,444
You like twain?

502
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:18,179
Yeah, i do.

503
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:20,720
You see? There you are.
You've cheered me up.

504
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,568
People who like twain
always cheer me up.

505
00:25:26,464 --> 00:25:27,965
Did you get the job?

506
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,131
I got the job.

507
00:25:35,932 --> 00:25:37,698
We need to talk about renee.

508
00:25:37,698 --> 00:25:38,744
I'm busy.

509
00:25:38,744 --> 00:25:41,856
Dell. We work really hard
to create babies here.

510
00:25:41,881 --> 00:25:44,843
We are in the business of
bringing babies into this world.

511
00:25:47,945 --> 00:25:49,598
Look, i don't know you
very well.

512
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,262
I certainly
don't know you well enough

513
00:25:51,262 --> 00:25:52,739
To judge you for this.

514
00:25:52,739 --> 00:25:54,740
But you don't know renee
very well,

515
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,749
Yet you were quick
to judge her.

516
00:25:57,605 --> 00:25:59,501
What-What-
Was she raped?

517
00:25:59,501 --> 00:26:01,953
Would it matter if she was?
Would that make it okay?

518
00:26:01,953 --> 00:26:04,468
I mean, does that make her
more or less worthy?

519
00:26:05,005 --> 00:26:06,998
We don't get to know why.

520
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:09,231
That is her business.
That's her choice, dell.

521
00:26:09,264 --> 00:26:11,901
That woman agonized
over a difficult choice,

522
00:26:11,901 --> 00:26:13,937
Made it and came in here.

523
00:26:13,937 --> 00:26:15,540
I guarantee you
she was already worried

524
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,889
About people out there
judging her

525
00:26:16,889 --> 00:26:19,203
Only to have you
make her feel ashamed.

526
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:20,894
But we are
medical professionals.

527
00:26:20,894 --> 00:26:23,122
It is part of our job
to support her

528
00:26:23,122 --> 00:26:26,555
Once she has made
the hardest choice imaginable.

529
00:26:34,765 --> 00:26:36,835
You're not allowed
down here, sean.

530
00:26:36,835 --> 00:26:39,515
I know. I...
look, i just-I can't...

531
00:26:41,883 --> 00:26:43,264
i made her laugh.

532
00:26:43,298 --> 00:26:44,765
I made her laugh,

533
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:47,274
And she looked away
from the road and...

534
00:26:48,624 --> 00:26:50,364
I... i caused it.

535
00:26:50,398 --> 00:26:51,977
I was responsible
for her coma.

536
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:55,247
I don't want to be responsible
for her staying like this.

537
00:26:55,247 --> 00:26:57,715
Please, i know
what the judge said...

538
00:26:57,798 --> 00:26:59,765
but...

539
00:26:59,798 --> 00:27:02,431
i- I need a miracle here.

540
00:27:03,898 --> 00:27:06,104
I'm asking for a miracle.

541
00:27:06,104 --> 00:27:08,331
You have to
stop punishing yourself.

542
00:27:08,364 --> 00:27:11,544
Sean, you didn't make
that accident happen.

543
00:27:11,544 --> 00:27:14,037
And you don't
make miracles happen.

544
00:27:14,114 --> 00:27:15,619
But i do.

545
00:27:15,619 --> 00:27:17,013
I'm about to go in there

546
00:27:17,013 --> 00:27:19,364
And deliver your miracle,
sean.

547
00:27:19,398 --> 00:27:22,356
And i know that this isn't
the path that you sought out

548
00:27:22,356 --> 00:27:25,529
Or the one that you and alena
saw for yourselves.

549
00:27:25,831 --> 00:27:28,991
But this is your baby,
the baby that alena wanted,

550
00:27:28,991 --> 00:27:31,244
And the one that she would
want you to raise.

551
00:27:31,244 --> 00:27:32,479
So i'm gonna go in that o.R.

552
00:27:32,479 --> 00:27:34,942
And i'm gonna
bring out that miracle.

553
00:27:44,848 --> 00:27:47,631
Did you-Did you talk to
the d.A.? What did he say?

554
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:49,765
You know,
i didn't talk to him yet.

555
00:27:49,798 --> 00:27:51,798
I- I wanted
to talk to you more.

556
00:27:51,832 --> 00:27:54,264
I was worried about you...

557
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:55,665
here...

558
00:27:55,698 --> 00:27:58,064
thinking about
what you did,

559
00:27:58,098 --> 00:27:59,964
What you had to do.

560
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:03,951
It must have been awful.

561
00:28:04,864 --> 00:28:06,264
It was.

562
00:28:06,298 --> 00:28:09,231
To do that
to someone you loved

563
00:28:09,264 --> 00:28:12,645
And to
have her ask for that...

564
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:15,565
for her to ask you
to use a gun...

565
00:28:16,131 --> 00:28:18,331
karen wanted it to be quick.

566
00:28:18,365 --> 00:28:19,857
She-She-She was afraid

567
00:28:19,857 --> 00:28:21,969
That-That something else
wouldn't work.

568
00:28:23,798 --> 00:28:25,798
She was just
in so much pain and-

569
00:28:25,832 --> 00:28:26,932
I know. I know. I know.

570
00:28:26,932 --> 00:28:29,019
I know all about
her pain, doug.

571
00:28:29,525 --> 00:28:31,470
But what about your pain?

572
00:28:31,716 --> 00:28:34,287
I want to know
about your pain.

573
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:39,903
Dell. Come here.

574
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,854
You're antiabortion.

575
00:28:44,117 --> 00:28:45,903
I am.

576
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,712
Yeah, unapologetically.

577
00:28:47,712 --> 00:28:48,735
Do you think
it makes a difference

578
00:28:48,735 --> 00:28:50,848
Why a woman would want
to have an abortion,

579
00:28:50,848 --> 00:28:54,092
Like rape or
- I think it matters why it bothers you.

580
00:28:54,954 --> 00:28:57,253
What do you mean? Well, if
- If you're against it

581
00:28:57,287 --> 00:28:59,253
For religious beliefs
or-Or personal beliefs,

582
00:28:59,287 --> 00:29:00,706
That's one thing.

583
00:29:00,706 --> 00:29:03,421
God or-Or something
in your soul is-

584
00:29:03,421 --> 00:29:05,278
Is trying
to tell you something.

585
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:07,139
I... i refused to even learn

586
00:29:07,139 --> 00:29:08,821
How to perform the procedure
in medical school.

587
00:29:08,821 --> 00:29:12,356
I couldn't.
I just... i couldn't.

588
00:29:12,727 --> 00:29:15,757
But if abortion bothers you
for other reasons...

589
00:29:17,086 --> 00:29:18,587
what?

590
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:21,220
Look, i don't-I don't-
I don't want to be responsible

591
00:29:21,253 --> 00:29:24,086
For swaying you to the other side. What?

592
00:29:25,053 --> 00:29:28,220
Did your child's mother,
uh.

593
00:29:28,253 --> 00:29:30,620
Did she consider
having an abortion?

594
00:29:33,587 --> 00:29:36,186
You tried to talk her
into getting one.

595
00:29:39,353 --> 00:29:40,731
Yeah.

596
00:29:41,186 --> 00:29:44,220
And now you look into
your daughter's beautiful face,

597
00:29:44,253 --> 00:29:46,153
And you feel guilty.

598
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,687
It's just...

599
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,021
we went to the clinic,

600
00:29:53,053 --> 00:29:55,587
And she wouldn't
get out of the car,

601
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,589
And i yelled at her.

602
00:29:59,196 --> 00:30:02,586
I yelled at her, and, uh,
you know, now i just...

603
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:07,025
i just can't believe
i yelled at her.

604
00:30:11,453 --> 00:30:13,320
Then i think

605
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:16,726
You are not against
a woman's right to choose.

606
00:30:17,222 --> 00:30:21,282
You're just punishing yourself
for the choice you almost made.

607
00:30:27,065 --> 00:30:28,572
I've told you everything.

608
00:30:28,572 --> 00:30:30,304
You released her.

609
00:30:31,021 --> 00:30:33,387
You gave her everything
she wanted.

610
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:36,273
So you should feel like
a weight has been lifted.

611
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:39,520
But you don't, do you?

612
00:30:39,554 --> 00:30:41,258
It's hard to feel that way
when i'm in here.

613
00:30:41,258 --> 00:30:43,284
It must've been hard-

614
00:30:43,284 --> 00:30:46,754
Her in pain, yelling at you,

615
00:30:47,613 --> 00:30:49,733
Wanting you to help her.

616
00:30:49,733 --> 00:30:52,541
She made you feel awful
every day of your life,

617
00:30:52,736 --> 00:30:55,388
So you must have thought
that by helping her,

618
00:30:55,388 --> 00:30:57,265
The pain would go away.

619
00:30:57,787 --> 00:30:59,921
But it hasn't

620
00:30:59,954 --> 00:31:03,387
Because the truth is still
eating away at you.

621
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:06,220
I couldn't take it
anymore.

622
00:31:06,253 --> 00:31:09,954
Okay. You need
to let it go, doug.

623
00:31:10,411 --> 00:31:12,273
Just let it go.

624
00:31:13,053 --> 00:31:17,006
She kept...
yelling at me...

625
00:31:17,487 --> 00:31:20,096
for me to do things
for her.

626
00:31:21,587 --> 00:31:24,987
She would say things
to hurt me.

627
00:31:25,021 --> 00:31:28,420
She would lie in that bed
and throw things at me

628
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:30,844
And-And call me an idiot
and a weakling

629
00:31:30,844 --> 00:31:33,198
And tell me everything
i was doing was wrong

630
00:31:33,198 --> 00:31:36,321
When all i wanted to do
was help her.

631
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:39,535
And the more she would yell,
the more she would bleed.

632
00:31:39,535 --> 00:31:41,336
And there was blood everywhere,

633
00:31:41,336 --> 00:31:44,650
And i couldn't take her
and i couldn't take the blood,

634
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:47,751
And... and i stopped
feeling sorry for her.

635
00:31:47,751 --> 00:31:49,080
And-And all i thought about

636
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,646
Was that
i should have left her,

637
00:31:50,646 --> 00:31:51,726
But i couldn't leave her now.

638
00:31:51,726 --> 00:31:52,831
I couldn't
just walk out the door,

639
00:31:52,831 --> 00:31:54,688
But i couldn't stay.

640
00:31:54,915 --> 00:31:58,728
I couldn't
hear her yell anymore.

641
00:31:59,336 --> 00:32:01,138
I couldn't hear it.

642
00:32:01,769 --> 00:32:04,238
So i took the gun...

643
00:32:04,837 --> 00:32:06,935
and i stopped it.

644
00:32:08,903 --> 00:32:11,096
I stopped her.

645
00:32:13,437 --> 00:32:15,203
You murdered her.

646
00:32:16,146 --> 00:32:18,612
I put her
out of her misery.

647
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:20,146
No.

648
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:23,120
You put yourself
out of your misery.

649
00:32:30,146 --> 00:32:31,548
Dr. Porter.

650
00:32:32,213 --> 00:32:34,563
Renee. I tried calling.

651
00:32:34,563 --> 00:32:36,176
I know.
I got your message.

652
00:32:36,176 --> 00:32:39,157
I am so sorry
for the way you were treated.

653
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:42,383
Dell was out of line,
and i apologize.

654
00:32:42,383 --> 00:32:45,813
I'm just glad you didn't ignore
my message. Well, i did ignore it.

655
00:32:45,847 --> 00:32:47,780
I mean, i listened to it,

656
00:32:47,813 --> 00:32:49,410
But i wasn't
going to come back.

657
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:50,883
Well, i don't understand.
Why are you-

658
00:32:50,883 --> 00:32:53,179
Dell called me.

659
00:32:55,403 --> 00:32:56,780
Ah.

660
00:33:04,847 --> 00:33:08,489
Oceanside wellness performs
its first abortion.

661
00:33:09,113 --> 00:33:10,582
Wonderful.

662
00:33:12,146 --> 00:33:13,987
She's throwing
multiple p.V.C.S.

663
00:33:13,987 --> 00:33:15,410
Bolus her with 100 of lido

664
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,022
And start
a 2-Milligram-Per-Minute drip.

665
00:33:17,022 --> 00:33:20,260
Lap pad.
Lost her pressure. V-Fib.

666
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:23,113
She's going into cardiac arrest.
Get a crash cart.

667
00:33:23,146 --> 00:33:25,580
She's throwing an embolus.
Start c.P.R. Epi.5.

668
00:33:25,613 --> 00:33:27,486
Let's go.
The baby?

669
00:33:28,179 --> 00:33:29,627
Got her.

670
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:36,494
Charge to 200.

671
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,813
Clear.

672
00:33:56,313 --> 00:33:58,429
Okay.
You ready?

673
00:33:58,429 --> 00:34:00,358
You ready to see daddy?

674
00:34:00,358 --> 00:34:02,180
Oh.

675
00:34:03,444 --> 00:34:05,484
She's beautiful.

676
00:34:06,793 --> 00:34:08,833
Oh,
she has your nose...

677
00:34:09,775 --> 00:34:11,863
and alena's eyes.

678
00:34:11,863 --> 00:34:13,651
I'm so...

679
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:16,504
so sorry for your loss.

680
00:34:24,514 --> 00:34:26,103
Sean?

681
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:35,318
I'm afraid you can't.

682
00:34:35,318 --> 00:34:37,308
It's against
hospital regulations.

683
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:39,687
I want her
to meet her mother,

684
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:43,697
And i want to say good-Bye.

685
00:35:19,549 --> 00:35:21,638
This is our daughter.

686
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,066
Look what we made.

687
00:35:53,366 --> 00:35:55,200
Um...

688
00:35:55,233 --> 00:35:59,250
i don't know if you
hear this a lot from us,

689
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:00,832
But...

690
00:36:00,866 --> 00:36:02,645
thank you.

691
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:12,999
I hope you know she made

692
00:36:13,033 --> 00:36:15,333
The best decision
she could for herself.

693
00:36:15,898 --> 00:36:18,161
I just always thought
medicine was going to be

694
00:36:18,161 --> 00:36:19,832
About helping people.

695
00:36:19,866 --> 00:36:21,531
It is.

696
00:36:27,933 --> 00:36:29,138
Naomi-

697
00:36:29,138 --> 00:36:31,030
Uh, dell, i'm proud of you

698
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:34,475
For doing what you thought
was right, but i-I just can't.

699
00:36:34,846 --> 00:36:36,203
Not now.

700
00:36:43,683 --> 00:36:45,666
We're on
the same time schedule.

701
00:36:47,633 --> 00:36:49,610
Can i ask
your professional advice?

702
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:52,983
Sure.
Step into my office.

703
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,466
Well...
let's say you have a client,

704
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,190
And this client
has been through hell.

705
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:05,327
And it's a client
that you like,

706
00:37:05,327 --> 00:37:06,985
You really like.

707
00:37:07,211 --> 00:37:11,966
And they've
done something... wrong.

708
00:37:11,999 --> 00:37:14,039
Or maybe they've
done something right

709
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:15,812
For the wrong reasons...

710
00:37:18,115 --> 00:37:20,318
i'm not making any sense,
am i?

711
00:37:21,266 --> 00:37:23,133
Did anyone get hurt?

712
00:37:23,166 --> 00:37:24,633
Yes.

713
00:37:24,667 --> 00:37:27,066
You have your answer...

714
00:37:27,099 --> 00:37:28,832
don't you?

715
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:34,999
I'm...

716
00:37:35,033 --> 00:37:36,808
i'm violet.

717
00:37:37,149 --> 00:37:38,857
Violet turner.

718
00:37:50,366 --> 00:37:52,533
You asked
what happened to me

719
00:37:52,567 --> 00:37:54,400
Between then and now.

720
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,409
I have a dead wife
that i hated...

721
00:38:02,567 --> 00:38:03,966
hated...

722
00:38:03,999 --> 00:38:06,262
until the moment
she was gone.

723
00:38:08,133 --> 00:38:11,397
And if i could...

724
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:16,122
take back the hate...

725
00:38:18,781 --> 00:38:21,141
it killed a piece of me.

726
00:38:23,545 --> 00:38:25,600
There's a piece of me
that no longer exists

727
00:38:25,633 --> 00:38:26,933
Because of her.

728
00:38:26,933 --> 00:38:28,533
So when you feel threatened-

729
00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:30,291
There are very few women
that i trust.

730
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:34,689
You trust the women here-
Naomi, violet, addison.

731
00:38:35,167 --> 00:38:37,577
I'm doing the best i can,
okay?

732
00:38:37,699 --> 00:38:39,600
Okay.

733
00:38:41,564 --> 00:38:42,899
He's going to prison

734
00:38:42,933 --> 00:38:45,930
For a very, very,
very long time.

735
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:47,383
Yeah.

736
00:38:47,383 --> 00:38:49,113
Poor karen.

737
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:53,408
I feel so guilty that
i ever believed in him.

738
00:38:53,966 --> 00:38:56,742
Are you at all religious?

739
00:38:57,567 --> 00:38:59,133
No.

740
00:38:59,166 --> 00:39:01,075
Well...

741
00:39:01,567 --> 00:39:06,200
in church,
when someone dies...

742
00:39:08,233 --> 00:39:12,147
we light a candle
to remember them.

743
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,866
What are we doing?

744
00:39:37,099 --> 00:39:39,300
Trying to forgive ourselves.

745
00:39:41,766 --> 00:39:43,681
Can i get in on that?

746
00:40:15,832 --> 00:40:18,306
A baby died today.

747
00:40:39,133 --> 00:40:40,905
Hey.

748
00:40:43,633 --> 00:40:45,200
Long day?

749
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,184
Let me make you
something to eat.

750
00:40:47,184 --> 00:40:48,425
You must be starving.

751
00:40:48,425 --> 00:40:51,557
Addison,
you took care of me.

752
00:40:51,557 --> 00:40:53,790
Now let me take care of you.

753
00:41:01,433 --> 00:41:03,429
I'm fine.

754
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,159
I made a miracle today.

755
00:41:11,732 --> 00:41:14,122
I'm fine.

756
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:19,560
I'm fine.
