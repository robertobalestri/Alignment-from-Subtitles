1
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:06,206
Previously on "ER.."

2
00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:07,808
Your East Coast
squeeze is here.

3
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:09,275
She's kind of a
looker in an..

4
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:10,711
...interstate,
off‐ramp kind of way.

5
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:12,813
I'm here now, baby.

6
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:18,184
‐ Bobby hit me.
‐ What?

7
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:19,553
‐ Broke a rib.
‐ I'm sorry.

8
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:21,287
I didn't know,
but you didn't say anything.

9
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:23,089
Why didn't you go
to the police?

10
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:24,424
He is the police.

11
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:25,759
A compass?

12
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:28,361
Seeing as how we always
find each other.

13
00:00:28,394 --> 00:00:30,130
‐ Can we talk?
‐ What?

14
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:32,098
I'm pregnant.

15
00:00:58,158 --> 00:00:59,593
What are you doing?

16
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:01,695
Well, Christmas
was two weeks ago.

17
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,865
I figured it's time
to put it away.

18
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,733
Leave it. I like it.

19
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:08,468
You want to be one
of those people

20
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:11,304
dragging some dead brown tree
out into the street

21
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:13,139
in the middle of April?

22
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,542
I like those people.

23
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,511
They don't give up easy.

24
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:25,652
I made this
for Maggie when I was..

25
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:29,455
I think, six.

26
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:33,226
We were living in a motel.
The Minnetonka.

27
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:42,435
Don't you have a search
committee meeting this morning?

28
00:01:42,468 --> 00:01:43,704
I could skip it.

29
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:45,872
‐ We can talk some more.
‐ No, you should go.

30
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:48,441
I have to be
in soon, so..

31
00:02:01,487 --> 00:02:03,557
I guess we haven't
figured anything out yet.

32
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,860
Yeah, I really..

33
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:08,862
...don't want
to get into it again.

34
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:10,831
Have you made a decision?

35
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:12,566
Well, we don't even know
what we are to each other.

36
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,735
‐ No one ever knows that.
‐ Oh, come on.

37
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:16,903
We've been friends
for a long time.

38
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:18,404
‐ Good friends.
‐ Yeah?

39
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:19,873
Been through a lot together.

40
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:23,376
That doesn't mean we could
take care of a child.

41
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:25,345
It has to be your choice.

42
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,215
I know that.

43
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:33,253
Ground‐level fall
in the ambulance bay!

44
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,522
‐ No head trauma, no LOC.
‐ Okay, it's alright.

45
00:02:35,556 --> 00:02:36,857
‐ I'm fine.
‐ Complains of right hip pain.

46
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,324
‐ Can't bear weight.
‐ Would you stop it?

47
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:39,459
I'm just trying
to be professional.

48
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,294
It's annoying.

49
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:44,464
Whose job is to
de‐ice the entrance?

50
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,599
Just get back to work.
It's only a bruise.

51
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,800
‐ I'm fine.
‐ You know what?

52
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,868
I'm going to go
find you a bed.

53
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,536
No, no, I don't
need all that.

54
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,271
Hey, acetaminophen OD,
should I give mucomyst

55
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:52,472
before the level's back?

56
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:53,574
Dr. Weaver,
can you look over..

57
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,477
Hold it. I am not..
I'm not even on today.

58
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,479
Guys, guys, easy, easy.

59
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:00,681
Look, she had a nasty little
slip on the ice

60
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:01,982
'so let's give her
some space.'

61
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,483
Okay?

62
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,285
Thank you.

63
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:08,989
‐ Alright, what?
‐ What, what?

64
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,691
What do you want?

65
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:11,792
I need a few weeks off.

66
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:13,226
Why?

67
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:14,561
My band got a recording deal.

68
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:16,797
We're going to LA.

69
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,799
Back away from the gurney

70
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:20,867
or I will impale you
with my crutch.

71
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:22,569
Kerry..

72
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:24,204
Back off, Elvis.

73
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:20,326
Ah! This damn salt's
ruined my shoes.

74
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,862
Yeah, well, New York's
been snow‐free all year.

75
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:23,029
Why don't you go back there?

76
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:24,965
These are Jimmy Choos.

77
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,668
Timmy who? And why are
you wearing his shoes?

78
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:30,470
Choos, and they
cost me about 400 bucks.

79
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:32,038
A, number one, you
shouldn't be wearing shoes

80
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:33,607
that cost more than
other people's rent

81
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,008
and B, number two

82
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,811
it's January in Chicago.
Get some damn boots.

83
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:39,412
Hey, let me
tell you something, Vic.

84
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,081
‐ You're not a morning person.
‐ No, I'm not.

85
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,583
Hey, excuse me.
Excuse me.

86
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:43,917
Can I get some
more coffee please

87
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,719
and some splenda,
about a fistful?

88
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,688
'No problem.'

89
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:49,590
‐ What?
‐ Shut up.

90
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,024
All I'm saying is
you're not really prepared

91
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,358
for winter here, are you?

92
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:53,426
So?

93
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,761
So?

94
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,532
So?

95
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,103
So, so, so why don't you
stay at my place today?

96
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,740
I want to see Michigan Avenue.

97
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:08,842
Alright, fine, just
don't buy it, will you?

98
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,711
I can shop
if I want to here.

99
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:12,312
On whose credit card?

100
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,849
You're still
worried about Bobby.

101
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,951
I told you that
I severed all ties with him.

102
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,486
Just because you severed
all ties with Bobby

103
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:22,523
doesn't mean that he severed
all ties with you, okay?

104
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:23,890
He has no idea
where I went.

105
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:25,926
No, of course not.
He has no idea.

106
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,761
Of course, he would never think
of you being with me.

107
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:28,795
He doesn't know where you are.

108
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,698
No, no. He's a freakin' cop.

109
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:33,399
How hard you think that is, huh?

110
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:34,535
What, are you stupid? I mean..

111
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:36,436
How stupid
do you have to be?

112
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:42,876
‐ What?
‐ Give me some money.

113
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:45,712
‐ What for?
‐ For a cab. Give me some money.

114
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:47,147
Oh, come on. Don't do this.

115
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,915
Don't be ridiculous, okay?
Just don't.

116
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:51,818
Give me the money.

117
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,020
Yeah, I need another 20.

118
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:57,123
Come on.
Don't do this.

119
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:58,659
And you know what
you should think about?

120
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,493
You don't touch me.

121
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,495
You should think about getting
into some meditation classes

122
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,532
or maybe some pilates or
something, because you, Vic

123
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:07,568
are getting very ugly.

124
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:10,470
And I mean that in the most
metaphorical sense, okay?

125
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:12,639
Come on, don't walk away mad.

126
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:15,441
What? Now I got to go get myself
some boots, you jerk‐off.

127
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:16,476
Oh, come on.

128
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,711
Come back here.
Jody?

129
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,414
I'm sorry, I'm having trouble
clearing a bed.

130
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:23,049
You know, this really
isn't necessary.

131
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,051
I'm sure I can
get to my office.

132
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:26,720
Oh, you should let me
examine you.

133
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:27,988
Alright. Alright.

134
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:29,055
Just treat me like
any other patient.

135
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:30,857
‐ You sure?
‐ Yeah.

136
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,959
‐ Get me out of the hall.
‐ Neela, let's run the board.

137
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:34,460
I have to take
my broken hip lady..

138
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,062
Hey! Not broken.

139
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:37,531
Ted Cunningham, 23.

140
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,165
Lost his shiley
at the nursing home.

141
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,502
Found him cyanotic,
put a 7‐0 in the neck.

142
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:42,903
Okay, Pratt,
go with them.

143
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,638
He had a lot of mucus.

144
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:46,472
We tried to suction him,
but his trach tube came out

145
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:47,841
and he turned blue.

146
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,176
‐ You from the home?
‐ No, I'm his mother.

147
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,012
Ted, can you open your eyes?

148
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:53,547
He can't follow commands.

149
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,216
Okay, excuse us.

150
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,718
NG tube and a #6 shiley.

151
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,986
94 and 15 liters.
He needs an NG?

152
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,556
You use it as a guide
to change the airway.

153
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:05,826
How long has he been like this?

154
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:07,794
Two years.

155
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:10,063
Ever since the night
he turned 21.

156
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,466
His friends took him to a bar
and made him drink 21 shots.

157
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:16,970
On the way home,
he stepped into traffic

158
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:19,172
and got clipped
by a pickup truck.

159
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:24,745
You spend your whole life
raising a kid right, and then..

160
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:29,650
one...stupid night
turns him into this.

161
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:43,764
'Where are you?
It's time to open the presents.'

162
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:50,470
Just making sure.

163
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,777
Well, I think
you can stop now.

164
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,550
We could find a way
to make it work.

165
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:05,986
‐ If that's what you want.
‐ I don't know what I want.

166
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:12,926
I am 37 years old.
If not now, when?

167
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,128
You know how
I feel about it.

168
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,598
Everything happens
for a reason.

169
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,836
It scares me, Luka.

170
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,809
Having it,
or choosing not to?

171
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:34,147
Yeah.

172
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,049
Pull the NG and bag him.

173
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:37,083
Abby.

174
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:38,919
Bag him.

175
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:40,721
Is he alright?

176
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:43,323
He should be much better
now that he has a new tube.

177
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,058
Thank you.

178
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:50,296
Sats up to 99.

179
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,032
What's Coburn doing here?

180
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:53,967
Oh, Kovac's got
her down on this lady

181
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,035
with ovarian torsion.

182
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,838
Dr. Rasgotra..

183
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,673
Someone seems to
have left this.

184
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:03,877
So...how's
married life?

185
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,178
It's very nice,
thank you.

186
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,847
We're looking for a place
of our own.

187
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,615
Ah, sounds exciting.

188
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:10,150
The army wants Michael
to finish his residency

189
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:11,317
at a military hospital.

190
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:13,153
And where's the
closest program?

191
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:15,689
Fort Hood, Texas.

192
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:18,091
I'm hoping he can end up
somewhere not too far away.

193
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:19,726
Tenderness over
the greater trochanter?

194
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,327
Yeah, it's probably
just a contusion

195
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:22,729
from where I hit the ground.

196
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:25,331
I'm going to check
your range of motion.

197
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:29,670
Ow!
Oh, God.

198
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:31,672
Pain with internal rotation.

199
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:33,073
You know.
That's happened before.

200
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:34,808
I just need an ice pack
for ten minutes

201
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:35,942
and it'll stop.

202
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:37,077
And something
for the pain, perhaps?

203
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,311
Percocet, Vicodin?

204
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,647
No. No, I have
too much work to do.

205
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:44,217
800 of ibuprofen, and,
uh, call for a hip series.

206
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,220
Well, I'll have to run it
past my attending fir..

207
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,055
I'm sorry.

208
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,625
Hey, pull the curtain, please.

209
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:55,896
How's she doing?

210
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,397
A bit cranky
at the moment.

211
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,899
Yeah, well, you'll soften
her up for me, right?

212
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,734
‐ What?
‐ For my TO request.

213
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,268
What do you need
time off for?

214
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:05,371
Neela, do you know
who Barry Ginsberg is?

215
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:07,173
Gynecologist
on fourth floor?

216
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:09,075
No. No, he's
a record producer.

217
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,376
A mogul, an idol‐maker.

218
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,912
He took a listen to
a couple of tracks

219
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,080
my boys laid down, and,
bang, we are going to LA

220
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,782
and we have a gig
at the key club.

221
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:17,751
And if all goes well,
we get to record a demo

222
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,319
at his studio in Venice.

223
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,788
‐ Italy?
‐ California, on the beach.

224
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:23,389
Congratulations, Ray.
That's really awesome.

225
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:26,192
Here, super‐infected
foot fungus in Four.

226
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:28,795
Uh, only thing is, is, I'm gonna
need a little time off.

227
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:31,397
‐ How much is a little?
‐ Eh, just a month.

228
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:33,299
That's not a little.

229
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,901
Hey, can you check out
this patient for me?

230
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:37,037
Amanda Ramsey, 15,
presented with vague pain.

231
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,705
I'm sorry, I have
to get some ibuprofen

232
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:40,206
and a hip series
for Dr. Weaver.

233
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,843
Please?
I'll trade you.

234
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:45,211
‐ I didn't tell her yet.
‐ Thanks a lot.

235
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,283
Amanda, I'm Dr. Rasgotra.

236
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,185
How much longer
do you think it'll be?

237
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:53,820
'Cause I didn't mean
to make a big deal.

238
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:55,355
I probably just need
some motrin or something.

239
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,924
We ran a test
on your urine.

240
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,326
Do I have a bladder infection?

241
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,195
You're pregnant.

242
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:05,866
Did you know that?

243
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:15,041
You didn't tell my parents,
did you?

244
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:17,778
They've been told that
you were here, but that's all.

245
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:20,280
Who's the father?

246
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:24,317
Some guy from school.

247
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:27,253
Boyfriend?

248
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:28,254
No.

249
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:32,292
I can get our
adolescent clinic

250
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:33,493
to come down
and talk to you.

251
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:35,328
No, my parents won't like that.

252
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,063
There are a number
of options.

253
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:40,767
Yeah, I can keep it,
or put it up for adoption.

254
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:42,969
Or you could choose
not to have it.

255
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,907
I could never do that.

256
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:51,044
It'd be against God.

257
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,816
‐ They stabbed me in the heart!
‐ PP Perkins, mugging victim.

258
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:57,851
Stab wounds to the chest,
arms and abdomen.

259
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,085
I got blood coming out
everywhere!

260
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:00,987
He's only satting 82.

261
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:02,455
‐ You guys need a hand?
‐ No, we're on it.

262
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,290
Chest tube in here. Come on now.
Come on, let's move it!

263
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:07,160
Okay, we're gonna need
to remove an ovary, Sara

264
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:08,829
but that's why
God gave you a spare.

265
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:10,797
It's gonna be fine.
Um, prep her in Two.

266
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:13,800
I should be up in...15 minutes.

267
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:15,201
‐ How's it going?
‐ Oh, well, good.

268
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,337
She's young, and
the other ovary looks good, so..

269
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,272
Uh, no, I‐I meant..

270
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,207
Oh, "how's it going?"
Oh, well, fine.

271
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,442
‐ You?
‐ Good.

272
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:23,844
I just got paged
for an ultrasound.

273
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:24,878
Do you know anything
about that?

274
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,913
Uh, no.
No.

275
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:28,414
Um, but I remember hearing

276
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:30,283
that you started
your own practice?

277
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:33,554
Yeah, yeah. It's going,
uh, very well, you know.

278
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:35,956
The only problem's the boss.
Ooh, what a bitch.

279
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:40,460
‐ I'm the boss, Abby.
‐ Right.

280
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:41,928
Now you're
patronizing me.

281
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:45,131
No. I...um, I just..

282
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:46,967
I just, uh, might want
to come and see you.

283
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,802
I need an OB.

284
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:50,070
Congratulations.

285
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,105
Wow. I had no idea.

286
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,274
I'll shut up.

287
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:57,944
Yeah. It wasn't
something I expected.

288
00:12:57,978 --> 00:13:00,480
Is it something you want?

289
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:02,048
I'm not sure

290
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:04,117
I'm at the...right place

291
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,420
in my life for this, so..

292
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,591
So, you don't want
to keep it?

293
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:13,293
‐ Oh, I'm sorry.
‐ Okay. I'm always prepared.

294
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:14,961
Here.

295
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:16,863
Thanks.

296
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:19,065
Um, I've got office hours
every afternoon.

297
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:20,400
Just come by any time.

298
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:22,536
I can help you,
whether it's prenatal care

299
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:26,039
or termination,
whatever you decide.

300
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:27,941
Thank you.

301
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:30,611
And whatever
you do, Abby, it's..

302
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,145
...gonna be the right thing.

303
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:34,014
Thanks.

304
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:42,055
Oh, God.

305
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:46,560
Systolic's only 86.

306
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:48,061
Almost there. Get the thoraseal.

307
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:50,063
Okay, a little pressure now.

308
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:51,932
Alright, so who
really jacked you, huh, PP?

309
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:54,434
It was some‐some guys
I know, man.

310
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:56,069
Sats coming up.

311
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:57,504
We was drinking
by this fire in this alley.

312
00:13:57,538 --> 00:13:59,105
Right, must be some real
good friends.

313
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:00,306
They avoided stabbing you
in the heart, huh?

314
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,042
Hey, Malik, did somebody
call the cops?

315
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:03,910
‐ Yeah, they're on their way.
‐ Don't call no cops.

316
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:06,446
‐ No cops, man.
‐ BP's better, 110 over 75.

317
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:08,214
No cops? These guys
could have killed you.

318
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:09,650
No, I got problems, yo.

319
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:11,885
I got problems.
Cops only gonna make it worse.

320
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:13,419
I feel you, bro.
Trust me, I feel you.

321
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,421
Then do me a solid, man.

322
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:17,223
Anything for you, PP,
anything.

323
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:20,060
More lube.

324
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:23,496
‐ It's cold.
‐ Oh, sorry about that.

325
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,432
‐ Dr. Coburn.
‐ I called OB.

326
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:28,535
'Could there have been a mistake
with that other test?'

327
00:14:28,569 --> 00:14:30,170
Mm, I don't think so.

328
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:33,039
Here. You see this?

329
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:35,576
That's the
heart beating.

330
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:38,411
It's about
seven weeks old, I'd say.

331
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:41,447
They won't understand.

332
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:44,985
‐ Your parents?
‐ They'll say I've sinned.

333
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:48,254
I can help you talk
to them if you want.

334
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:50,490
Can I have a minute?

335
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,460
You were in with a patient, so
I thought it was best to just..

336
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:57,063
Yeah. It would be better
if you presented to me first.

337
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:59,032
Well, either way,
I had to call an OB.

338
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:01,001
She's 15 and scared.

339
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:02,235
Family on the way in?

340
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:03,670
They're very religious people.

341
00:15:03,704 --> 00:15:06,573
Call me when
they get here.

342
00:15:06,607 --> 00:15:08,341
How'd you do this?

343
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:11,077
Tried to hop a bus.

344
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:12,979
Did you slip on the ice?

345
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:14,648
I was skitching.

346
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:18,284
‐ Fell off the fender.
‐ Ah.

347
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:21,421
Might be easier
just to pay the fare.

348
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:24,290
Do I look like I got
surplus income to blow?

349
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:29,229
‐ Can I get another 3‐0 ethilon?
‐ 'Mm‐hmm.'

350
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:34,267
Were you, uh,
on your way home?

351
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,004
I haven't been
home in a while.

352
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:40,974
Since, like, May.

353
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:42,609
Well, your folks
must be worried about you.

354
00:15:42,643 --> 00:15:45,011
Yeah, they worry a lot.

355
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:47,247
Always wanting to know what
I'm doing, what I'm up to.

356
00:15:49,516 --> 00:15:52,653
Gets to be a real
drag, you know.

357
00:15:52,686 --> 00:15:54,287
Doesn't sound so bad.

358
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,690
I'm an independent spirit,
you know?

359
00:15:56,723 --> 00:15:58,491
I want to be on my own.

360
00:16:00,761 --> 00:16:02,529
Do they even know where you are?

361
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,399
No.

362
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,368
Just left one day.

363
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,475
What if I don't know
how to love it right?

364
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:18,378
'Abby.'

365
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:20,547
Maybe I'm not strong enough.

366
00:16:20,581 --> 00:16:22,382
Being a parent
makes you stronger.

367
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,686
And it breaks your heart.

368
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:27,420
You told me that.

369
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,155
That's not what I meant.

370
00:16:34,528 --> 00:16:36,329
I'm sorry. I didn't mean..

371
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,599
No. Don't‐don't
use that as a reason.

372
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:46,607
I'm sorry.

373
00:16:50,711 --> 00:16:54,648
What if I go shopping and
leave it in the supermarket?

374
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:57,083
Don't worry.
I'll do all the shopping.

375
00:17:03,657 --> 00:17:05,659
I'm afraid
I'd mess it up, Luka.

376
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:12,633
We won't.

377
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:17,671
Okay, um..

378
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,372
Keep the wound clean and dry.

379
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:21,642
Come back in a week
to have the stitches removed.

380
00:17:21,675 --> 00:17:24,745
‐ That's it?
‐ Yeah.

381
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:27,180
Unless you want to talk
to somebody from social work.

382
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:30,483
‐ Your daughter's right in here.
‐ Mandy, are you okay?

383
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:31,718
I'm fine, mom.

384
00:17:31,752 --> 00:17:34,220
I'll, uh, leave you
all to talk.

385
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:36,657
Could you stay?

386
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:37,791
Sure.

387
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,162
Mom..

388
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:43,630
Daddy..

389
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:47,601
Something happened, and, um..

390
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:49,770
‐ I'm real sorry.
‐ What happened, sweetie?

391
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:56,543
We ran a test
and did an ultrasound.

392
00:17:56,577 --> 00:17:59,513
Amanda's pregnant.

393
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:01,548
'We're waiting for
some blood results.'

394
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:03,449
‐ As soon as they arrive..
‐ That's fine.

395
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:06,887
There are a number
of places

396
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,488
we can refer you to
for counseling.

397
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:11,558
We'd like to be alone
with our daughter now.

398
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:13,527
Thank you.

399
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:19,399
No free fluid on ultrasound

400
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:20,801
waiting on surgery
to evaluate.

401
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:23,336
Not anymore, red.
What have you got?

402
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:25,238
‐ Morning, sunshine.
‐ Who are you?

403
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,874
‐ Clemente. Who are you?
‐ I'm Surgery. See the badge?

404
00:18:27,908 --> 00:18:29,576
Oh, yeah, you must be

405
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,745
the bedside manner coach
I heard so much about.

406
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:35,315
Uh, multiple stab wounds,
stable after the chest tube.

407
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:37,183
‐ Anything enter the peritoneum?
‐ Uh, not sure.

408
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:39,820
‐ Ultrasound's negative.
‐ Doesn't answer my question.

409
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:41,688
Hey, I got the cops
out here.

410
00:18:41,722 --> 00:18:44,124
Relax, relax.
I got your back.

411
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:48,529
If you can get a smile
out of Surgery here

412
00:18:48,562 --> 00:18:50,463
I'll pay for the date.

413
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:52,666
You're right on the cusp of
sexual harassment, Clemente.

414
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:56,202
The cusp. That would be
a new position for me.

415
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:58,872
Hey, guys, I'm the attending
physician on this case.

416
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:00,941
‐ Clemente?
‐ Yeah.

417
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:02,442
Now, the thing is,
this dude is very sick.

418
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,344
He's out of it,
completely out of it.

419
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:05,612
So, he's not gonna be able to
give a statement today, okay?

420
00:19:05,646 --> 00:19:07,313
‐ I'm sorry.
‐ Hold on a sec.

421
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:08,849
‐ You're Victor Clemente?
‐ Yeah.

422
00:19:08,882 --> 00:19:10,584
Were you listening to me? He's
not gonna be able to give you‐‐

423
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:13,820
Easy...we're not here
on your patient.

424
00:19:13,854 --> 00:19:16,456
We're here for you.

425
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,258
Dubenko's feisty gopher
is at it again.

426
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,492
What?

427
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:21,528
The chief resident
from the death star..

428
00:19:21,562 --> 00:19:23,864
‐ She's down on a consult.
‐ Albright?

429
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:25,532
'He's hemodynamically stable'

430
00:19:25,566 --> 00:19:26,933
with no peritoneal signs.

431
00:19:26,967 --> 00:19:28,401
So why'd you call me?

432
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:31,204
Look, missy,
it's protocol, alright?

433
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:34,474
You didn't really just
call me missy, did you?

434
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:38,411
Okay, look, the‐the case
meets Trauma criteria.

435
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:41,381
Next time, call me when you know
what you got on your hands.

436
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:43,449
‐ Are you Dr. Albright?
‐ He was stabbed in the belly.

437
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:45,485
I need to know
if he needs surgical repair.

438
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:46,920
Neela Rasgotra.
I heard you were here.

439
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:49,355
I wanted to catch you
about doing a Surgery elective?

440
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:50,591
Right.

441
00:19:50,624 --> 00:19:51,658
Work up your patient.

442
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:53,359
Image the belly

443
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:55,629
explore the wounds,
figure out how deep they are.

444
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:58,532
If they enter
the peritoneal cavity, call me.

445
00:19:58,565 --> 00:20:00,701
I'll be more than happy
to get involved.

446
00:20:00,734 --> 00:20:03,336
One third of stab wounds
enter the peritoneal cavity

447
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,671
and damage the viscera.

448
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:07,541
One third go in,
and don't hit anything.

449
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:09,876
And one third..

450
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:14,280
...are shallow and tangential.

451
00:20:16,617 --> 00:20:19,285
The trajectory was suggested
by the hilt mark of the knife.

452
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:20,987
He won't need surgery.

453
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:25,458
You should pay more attention
to your interns, red.

454
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:28,294
‐ I'm an R2, actually.
‐ Okay, R2.

455
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:29,630
Call me about
that elective.

456
00:20:29,663 --> 00:20:31,898
We might be able to
work something out.

457
00:20:37,838 --> 00:20:40,741
Parking violations. Come on,
you got to be kidding me, right?

458
00:20:40,774 --> 00:20:43,443
Okay. But you had some other
problems back east, didn't you?

459
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:45,311
What kind of problems
you talking about?

460
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:49,282
You left Newark General under
some very serious allegations.

461
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:52,553
I never...I never, never, never

462
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:54,487
compromised a patient's care.
Do you understand me?

463
00:20:54,521 --> 00:20:56,523
‐ I never..
‐ Okay, okay.

464
00:20:56,557 --> 00:20:58,058
Let's just get back
to Mrs. Kenyon.

465
00:20:58,091 --> 00:20:59,425
‐ She had some issues..
‐ What do you want me to say?

466
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:00,727
Issues? What issues?
She had no issues.

467
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:02,663
She was a nurse,
I'd ask her for 6‐0 vicryl

468
00:21:02,696 --> 00:21:04,531
and she'd bring it to me.
No issues.

469
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:05,699
Can I go now?
Thank you.

470
00:21:05,732 --> 00:21:07,601
Not yet.

471
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:08,869
Alright, you,
alright, you do realize

472
00:21:08,902 --> 00:21:10,336
that son of a bitch
hits her, right?

473
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:11,605
‐ So, you have seen her?
‐ You realize that?

474
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:13,840
No, I haven't seen her.

475
00:21:13,874 --> 00:21:16,710
But I can see what's going on
here, and it's pretty low.

476
00:21:16,743 --> 00:21:18,845
To sic you on me 'cause he
can't keep his own wife happy.

477
00:21:18,879 --> 00:21:20,346
That's pretty pathetic.

478
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,948
Right now, all we know
is Mrs. Kenyon's

479
00:21:21,982 --> 00:21:24,350
a missing person
who might be in trouble.

480
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:25,519
Well, she'll be in
more trouble if you find her.

481
00:21:25,552 --> 00:21:26,787
Meaning what?

482
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,988
Meaning, sometimes
people go missing

483
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:29,556
because they
feel safer that way.

484
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,457
My advice to you,
stop looking for her.

485
00:21:31,491 --> 00:21:32,959
Don't you go missing okay, Vic?

486
00:21:32,993 --> 00:21:34,027
‐ 'Cause I want to talk to you.
‐ Why would I go missing?

487
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,829
Why would I go missing? Why?

488
00:21:35,862 --> 00:21:38,031
Are you confusing me for one of
your lowlife, fascist scumbags‐‐

489
00:21:38,064 --> 00:21:39,833
Hey, you might want to settle
down before it gets embarras‐‐

490
00:21:39,866 --> 00:21:41,702
You know, I hope this
conversation doesn't throw me

491
00:21:41,735 --> 00:21:43,870
off my game today, especially
after all the cops' lives

492
00:21:43,904 --> 00:21:46,439
I've saved, I'd hate to
be less than 100 percent

493
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:47,808
when one of your brothers
comes in with a bullet

494
00:21:47,841 --> 00:21:48,842
through his belly.

495
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,711
I think we're done for now.

496
00:21:52,412 --> 00:21:53,980
Take it easy.

497
00:22:09,062 --> 00:22:12,666
Hey, we got any
loperamide in stock?

498
00:22:12,699 --> 00:22:14,668
Yeah, I'm sure he has.

499
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:32,418
Well, I got you
the good stuff.

500
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:33,854
‐ Today was..
‐ Hey.

501
00:22:33,887 --> 00:22:37,023
Oop, sorry. It's turkey day
in the cafeteria.

502
00:22:37,057 --> 00:22:39,560
‐ No.
‐ No what?

503
00:22:39,593 --> 00:22:41,895
Is the answer to your question.

504
00:22:43,463 --> 00:22:45,398
Can I at least state
my case first?

505
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:50,170
Okay.

506
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:51,471
This is big.

507
00:22:51,505 --> 00:22:53,807
This is a big
opportunity

508
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,109
for my band
and for me.

509
00:22:56,142 --> 00:22:57,443
And you never know
when you're going to get

510
00:22:57,477 --> 00:22:59,680
another shot like this.

511
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:01,948
My recollection is that
you were warned last year

512
00:23:01,982 --> 00:23:03,784
about your commitment
to this job.

513
00:23:03,817 --> 00:23:05,118
Yes, I was.

514
00:23:05,151 --> 00:23:07,621
And to your credit,
you've done an excellent job

515
00:23:07,654 --> 00:23:09,089
showing us that
you want to be here.

516
00:23:09,122 --> 00:23:12,192
‐ I do.
‐ You're a good doctor.

517
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:13,627
Thank you.

518
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,662
We don't need to
discuss this any further.

519
00:23:15,696 --> 00:23:17,731
You're valuable,
you're valued.

520
00:23:17,764 --> 00:23:19,065
Conversation over.

521
00:23:22,936 --> 00:23:24,805
Have you tried
the stuffing?

522
00:23:24,838 --> 00:23:26,507
It's great stuffing.

523
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,008
And, you know,
I got you an extra piece..

524
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:30,877
‐ Dr. Barnett.
‐ Look, Kerry..

525
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:34,114
Dr. Weaver, um..

526
00:23:34,147 --> 00:23:35,916
Have you ever
dreamed about something

527
00:23:35,949 --> 00:23:39,720
without ever believing
it would actually happen?

528
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:42,122
Because that's what this is.

529
00:23:42,155 --> 00:23:44,758
I've..

530
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:47,528
This is so huge to me
that if I couldn't do this

531
00:23:47,561 --> 00:23:50,163
I would seriously
consider quitting.

532
00:23:52,032 --> 00:23:54,801
Far be it from me to stand in
the way of the next Springsteen

533
00:23:54,835 --> 00:23:57,237
or KC and the Sunshine band.

534
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:59,472
Resignation accepted.

535
00:24:00,741 --> 00:24:02,008
What?

536
00:24:02,042 --> 00:24:03,476
Why do you want
to do Surgery anyway?

537
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,811
I'm curious about it.

538
00:24:04,845 --> 00:24:06,980
The hours suck,
the attendings are slave drivers

539
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:08,148
and the residents stab
each other in the back.

540
00:24:08,181 --> 00:24:09,650
Oh, not like down here

541
00:24:09,683 --> 00:24:11,484
where we're just
one big, happy family.

542
00:24:11,518 --> 00:24:12,919
What's wrong with you?

543
00:24:12,953 --> 00:24:14,688
Ashlee Simpson get caught
lip‐syncing again?

544
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:17,123
‐ I think I just quit.
‐ Quit?

545
00:24:17,157 --> 00:24:19,025
To go to California
with my band.

546
00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:21,528
Oh, great. Yeah.
No, bold move. I like it.

547
00:24:21,562 --> 00:24:22,829
Keeping that
music dream alive.

548
00:24:22,863 --> 00:24:24,030
Nah, you'll love California.

549
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,266
Everybody.
Ray Barnett, rock God!

550
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:28,835
Morris, I've already sent
my paperwork up to Surgery.

551
00:24:28,869 --> 00:24:30,804
Well, get it back.
I can't spare you.

552
00:24:30,837 --> 00:24:32,573
Especially now,
with Ray on his way out.

553
00:24:32,606 --> 00:24:34,240
If we're not fully staffed,
you're not going anywhere.

554
00:24:34,274 --> 00:24:36,176
I don't care what
Dr. Cruella says.

555
00:24:36,209 --> 00:24:39,580
Um...3:45. That'll work.
Yeah, thank you.

556
00:24:39,613 --> 00:24:41,615
‐ Ray's on his way out?
‐ Yeah, just up and quit.

557
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:43,116
Not going to let the man
keep him down.

558
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:45,151
‐ I don't think he meant to.
‐ Hey, guys?

559
00:24:45,185 --> 00:24:46,787
Guys, guys, come here.

560
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,154
You know the girl
I've been hanging out with?

561
00:24:48,188 --> 00:24:49,690
‐ Jodie?
‐ Yeah, we love Jodie.

562
00:24:49,723 --> 00:24:50,891
She taught me how to tie
a knot in a cherry stem

563
00:24:50,924 --> 00:24:52,626
using only my tongue.

564
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:53,894
‐ Really?
‐ Alright, come on guys.

565
00:24:53,927 --> 00:24:55,829
‐ Anybody ask for her?
‐ No.

566
00:24:55,862 --> 00:24:57,063
You never saw her, okay?

567
00:24:57,097 --> 00:24:58,899
And is anybody asks,
the same goes for me.

568
00:24:58,932 --> 00:25:01,134
‐ What?
‐ Pretend you never heard of me.

569
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:02,869
Lockhart, uh, Pratt's
bringing in a patient.

570
00:25:02,903 --> 00:25:04,671
‐ Get with him, okay?
‐ Okay.

571
00:25:07,073 --> 00:25:09,075
‐ He gets weirder every day.
‐ Look, Morris..

572
00:25:09,109 --> 00:25:10,677
You heard what
Dr. Albright said..

573
00:25:10,711 --> 00:25:12,278
So what? She's the
chief resident upstairs.

574
00:25:12,312 --> 00:25:13,680
I'm the chief down here.

575
00:25:13,714 --> 00:25:14,981
‐ You work for me.
‐ Oh, come on.

576
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:17,317
‐ That's not fair.
‐ Fair? What's fair?

577
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,786
Excuse me, doctor?

578
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,622
‐ Mr. Ramsey.
‐ Oh..

579
00:25:21,655 --> 00:25:24,224
I can sign whatever I need to
and we'll get out of your way.

580
00:25:24,257 --> 00:25:26,760
Would you like me to call
anyone for further treatment?

581
00:25:26,793 --> 00:25:30,831
Thank you, uh, I think we'll
arrange our own prenatal care.

582
00:25:30,864 --> 00:25:32,799
Amanda decided to keep it?

583
00:25:34,234 --> 00:25:36,837
The, uh...baby.

584
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,839
It's just that she's young

585
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:39,873
and it was an accident.

586
00:25:39,906 --> 00:25:42,876
No. No.

587
00:25:42,909 --> 00:25:45,145
I don't believe in accidents.

588
00:25:45,178 --> 00:25:47,781
Now, I know you
may not understand this

589
00:25:47,814 --> 00:25:51,585
but it is God's will
for her to have this child.

590
00:25:51,618 --> 00:25:54,655
I only mean, you may want to
consider the long‐term effects.

591
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,289
And you might want to consider
the spiritual effects

592
00:25:56,322 --> 00:25:57,924
of what you're suggesting.

593
00:25:57,958 --> 00:26:00,794
It's my job to make sure
the patient understands

594
00:26:00,827 --> 00:26:02,796
all the options
available to her.

595
00:26:02,829 --> 00:26:05,231
'A human life has
just been created'

596
00:26:05,265 --> 00:26:07,734
and, I'm sorry, but anything
that interferes with that

597
00:26:07,768 --> 00:26:11,805
is morally indefensible.

598
00:26:11,838 --> 00:26:13,974
Finished a cycle of chemo
two days ago.

599
00:26:14,007 --> 00:26:15,842
'Couldn't get an IV.
He's too dry.'

600
00:26:15,876 --> 00:26:17,678
'Pratt? OR needs
an attending to sign off'

601
00:26:17,711 --> 00:26:19,212
'on your
pancreatic pseudo cyst.'

602
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:21,081
‐ Where's Clemente?
‐ 'On the roof.'

603
00:26:21,114 --> 00:26:22,348
We getting
a chopper patient?

604
00:26:22,382 --> 00:26:24,384
No, he just, uh,
says that his cell phone

605
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:26,319
gets better reception
up there.

606
00:26:26,352 --> 00:26:27,988
Alright, place
a subclavian and bolus him.

607
00:26:28,021 --> 00:26:29,690
‐ I'll be back.
‐ Okay.

608
00:26:29,723 --> 00:26:31,391
Triple lumen tray
and one percent lido.

609
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:33,393
He's tachy at 132.

610
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:34,695
Little bit cold here.

611
00:26:36,897 --> 00:26:38,699
I was never the sickly type,
you know?

612
00:26:38,732 --> 00:26:40,901
‐ Yeah?
‐ Always very healthy.

613
00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:45,706
Used to do triathlons,
you believe that?

614
00:26:45,739 --> 00:26:47,173
Me, too.

615
00:26:47,207 --> 00:26:48,408
Really?

616
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:50,877
Smoking, drinking
and watching TV.

617
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,915
You should stop that.

618
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:56,282
I have.

619
00:26:57,918 --> 00:26:59,385
Six years ago

620
00:26:59,419 --> 00:27:02,689
I find out I inherited
the Philadelphia Chromosome.

621
00:27:02,723 --> 00:27:05,125
Ran on my mother's
side of the family.

622
00:27:05,158 --> 00:27:06,392
I never knew.

623
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:11,364
'Screwed by genetics.'

624
00:27:11,397 --> 00:27:12,766
'The first time I was panicked'

625
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,836
'the baby would be bipolar.'

626
00:27:15,869 --> 00:27:18,271
'And I'm not so sure
I've changed that much.'

627
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:19,706
'Well, the chances are slim'

628
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,908
'you know that.'

629
00:27:21,942 --> 00:27:25,145
Crossing the street is a risk.

630
00:27:25,178 --> 00:27:27,047
If you let it get to you

631
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,215
you'd never have children.

632
00:27:29,249 --> 00:27:31,217
Nobody would.

633
00:27:31,251 --> 00:27:34,020
Well, maybe some people
aren't supposed to.

634
00:27:34,054 --> 00:27:36,122
Well, I don't think
you're one of them.

635
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:42,863
Yeah, well, you don't know
what it was like..

636
00:27:42,896 --> 00:27:46,366
...with Maggie...and Eric.

637
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,169
God, you're looking
for reasons again.

638
00:27:50,771 --> 00:27:52,172
And what are you looking for?

639
00:27:52,205 --> 00:27:54,107
Someone to have a baby with?

640
00:28:00,881 --> 00:28:03,416
Is that what you think?

641
00:28:03,449 --> 00:28:06,887
Because if it is, then
what the hell are we doing here?

642
00:28:20,867 --> 00:28:22,168
Happy New Year.

643
00:28:35,949 --> 00:28:38,785
A whole cascade of things
have to happen to cause CML.

644
00:28:38,819 --> 00:28:40,954
Philadelphia Chromosome
doesn't mean instant cancer.

645
00:28:40,987 --> 00:28:42,523
No.

646
00:28:42,556 --> 00:28:46,026
Just that you're born
with a big strike against you.

647
00:28:48,128 --> 00:28:49,996
As soon as you get this message,
you call me, okay?

648
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:51,164
I want to talk to you.

649
00:28:51,197 --> 00:28:52,533
Immediately. Right away.

650
00:28:52,566 --> 00:28:54,000
Maybe you're
trying me right now

651
00:28:54,034 --> 00:28:56,002
so I'm just
going to hang up, and..

652
00:28:56,036 --> 00:28:57,370
...and you, and you
got to call me.

653
00:28:59,472 --> 00:29:02,408
You going to jump?

654
00:29:02,442 --> 00:29:03,476
It's not
a trick question.

655
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:06,346
Yeah, sure, it's not.

656
00:29:06,379 --> 00:29:10,150
Here, I need you
to sign off on this.

657
00:29:10,183 --> 00:29:12,185
What the hell you doing
up here, man? It's freezing.

658
00:29:12,218 --> 00:29:14,320
Yeah, well, I got
a very high core temp.

659
00:29:14,354 --> 00:29:16,156
It's a, it's a Latin thing.

660
00:29:17,591 --> 00:29:19,325
You want to talk
or something?

661
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:21,327
No. Why would I?

662
00:29:21,361 --> 00:29:23,396
I don't know.
You seem a little ragged.

663
00:29:25,098 --> 00:29:27,300
Yeah, well, I just got
some chick trouble, that's all.

664
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:28,569
Then I'm your man.

665
00:29:28,602 --> 00:29:30,436
Except I don't like to share.

666
00:29:32,338 --> 00:29:35,876
You know, I heard
you never stick anyplace.

667
00:29:35,909 --> 00:29:37,310
Maybe people don't
go to the mat for you

668
00:29:37,343 --> 00:29:40,380
because they have
no idea who you are.

669
00:29:49,389 --> 00:29:52,993
Alright.
Alright, so there was..

670
00:29:53,026 --> 00:29:55,061
There was this crazy nurse
at my last hospital.

671
00:29:55,095 --> 00:29:56,530
‐ In Newark?
‐ Yeah.

672
00:29:56,563 --> 00:29:57,964
She's just
a piece of work

673
00:29:57,998 --> 00:30:00,066
and it just,
just ended bad.

674
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,835
It usually does.

675
00:30:01,868 --> 00:30:04,170
So, you know, I came here,
I just came here just to focus

676
00:30:04,204 --> 00:30:05,471
to stay on the straight
and narrow, you know?

677
00:30:05,506 --> 00:30:07,073
Sounds like
a good idea.

678
00:30:07,107 --> 00:30:09,209
Yeah...one would think.

679
00:30:09,242 --> 00:30:10,476
Except it's
easier said than done

680
00:30:10,511 --> 00:30:12,378
'cause this girl..

681
00:30:12,412 --> 00:30:14,347
She's got my number,
if you know what I mean..

682
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,616
...and a very
pissed‐off husband.

683
00:30:17,551 --> 00:30:19,419
Yeah.

684
00:30:19,452 --> 00:30:21,187
See? I'm starting
to like you more already.

685
00:30:21,221 --> 00:30:22,188
Yeah.

686
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,527
Damn, so many patients. God.

687
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,530
‐ Don't you feel better now?
‐ Not really, no.

688
00:30:29,563 --> 00:30:30,931
Can't say that I do.

689
00:30:30,964 --> 00:30:32,498
Type, RH are back on Amanda.

690
00:30:32,533 --> 00:30:34,234
Oh. Then we're done.

691
00:30:36,269 --> 00:30:37,303
You off already?

692
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:38,872
Yeah.

693
00:30:38,905 --> 00:30:40,373
I have a doctor's
appointment.

694
00:30:40,406 --> 00:30:41,407
Oh.

695
00:30:41,441 --> 00:30:42,609
I'm going to see Coburn.

696
00:30:46,146 --> 00:30:48,048
‐ Coburn?
‐ At her practice.

697
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:52,085
Uh..

698
00:30:52,118 --> 00:30:53,920
I'll, uh, I'll get
Clemente to cover.

699
00:30:53,954 --> 00:30:56,557
‐ It's okay. You're working.
‐ No, I should come with you.

700
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:59,560
It probably would be
easier if you didn't.

701
00:30:59,593 --> 00:31:01,595
Hey. Hey.

702
00:31:05,498 --> 00:31:07,634
When I say
I want us to keep it

703
00:31:07,668 --> 00:31:09,603
you don't like
the way it sounds.

704
00:31:12,205 --> 00:31:14,240
But anything else
is a lie.

705
00:31:14,274 --> 00:31:16,042
Luka? Neela's waiting for you

706
00:31:16,076 --> 00:31:17,177
to sign off on the Ramsey girl.

707
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:19,045
‐ Get Clemente to do it.
‐ He's MIA.

708
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:27,120
I don't know
what else to say.

709
00:31:28,254 --> 00:31:29,656
Don't say anything.

710
00:31:41,467 --> 00:31:42,669
Take one of these every day.

711
00:31:42,703 --> 00:31:45,338
It'll help keep you
and your baby healthy.

712
00:31:45,371 --> 00:31:48,308
‐ Okay.
‐ Where are your parents?

713
00:31:48,341 --> 00:31:50,110
Oh, my mom's making some calls

714
00:31:50,143 --> 00:31:52,212
and my dad had
to go to a meeting.

715
00:31:52,245 --> 00:31:53,947
Okay, if it makes
you nauseous

716
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,282
try taking it at night
before you go to bed, okay?

717
00:31:58,552 --> 00:32:01,555
This is some more information
that might be useful.

718
00:32:01,588 --> 00:32:03,957
And, uh, we got this for you

719
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:06,359
from the ultrasound.

720
00:32:13,199 --> 00:32:16,603
I wish this didn't happen.

721
00:32:16,637 --> 00:32:19,005
I wish I could make it go away.

722
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:21,007
Well, everything
happens for a reason.

723
00:32:29,215 --> 00:32:31,552
There was this party..

724
00:32:31,585 --> 00:32:34,988
...at my friend Ginny's house.

725
00:32:35,021 --> 00:32:39,259
And I drank some beer
and I did some other stuff

726
00:32:39,292 --> 00:32:41,061
with a couple of guys, and..

727
00:32:44,197 --> 00:32:47,367
...and I must have passed out
in a bedroom because..

728
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,237
...when I woke up..

729
00:32:51,271 --> 00:32:52,606
...my jeans were on the floor

730
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:54,775
and there was blood
all over the sheets.

731
00:32:54,808 --> 00:32:56,476
'I tried to change the covers..'

732
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:58,478
Amanda..

733
00:32:58,512 --> 00:33:01,047
Were you raped?

734
00:33:01,081 --> 00:33:02,448
I always thought
the first time would be

735
00:33:02,482 --> 00:33:03,717
with someone I loved.

736
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,752
Why didn't you say something?

737
00:33:07,754 --> 00:33:11,057
I don't want this. Please.

738
00:33:11,091 --> 00:33:13,326
You need to explain
to your parents what happened.

739
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:17,030
They'll understand.
You have to tell them.

740
00:33:17,063 --> 00:33:18,364
I did tell them.

741
00:33:19,633 --> 00:33:21,535
Mrs. Ramsey.

742
00:33:21,568 --> 00:33:24,204
I'll call you back.

743
00:33:24,237 --> 00:33:26,072
Amanda told you
what happened to her?

744
00:33:26,106 --> 00:33:27,240
Yes.

745
00:33:27,273 --> 00:33:29,810
And you still
want her to do this?

746
00:33:29,843 --> 00:33:33,647
That baby can't be punished
for how it was conceived.

747
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,717
It's not up to us to determine
who gets to be born.

748
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:39,252
We're talking about
a 15‐year‐old girl

749
00:33:39,285 --> 00:33:41,187
your daughter, who was raped.

750
00:33:41,221 --> 00:33:42,322
And you'd force her
to carry this to term

751
00:33:42,355 --> 00:33:43,590
and change the course
of her life?

752
00:33:43,624 --> 00:33:46,459
I‐I wouldn't force her
to do anything.

753
00:33:46,492 --> 00:33:49,062
She believes the same
things that we believe.

754
00:33:49,095 --> 00:33:50,430
This is an inappropriate
conversation.

755
00:33:50,463 --> 00:33:52,799
Inappropriate? She's terrified.

756
00:33:52,833 --> 00:33:54,735
‐ She doesn't want to keep it.
‐ Okay, let's take a walk.

757
00:33:54,768 --> 00:33:56,269
Think for one minute

758
00:33:56,302 --> 00:33:57,437
'about what's in
your daughter's best interests.'

759
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,172
'Neela!'

760
00:33:59,205 --> 00:34:02,609
You think it's in her best
interest to kill the baby?

761
00:34:02,643 --> 00:34:04,410
Because I can assure you

762
00:34:04,444 --> 00:34:07,480
that in the eyes of God,
it most certainly is not.

763
00:34:07,514 --> 00:34:09,482
Excuse me.

764
00:34:09,516 --> 00:34:11,117
Okay, leave these
people alone now.

765
00:34:11,151 --> 00:34:12,252
They've made a decision.

766
00:34:12,285 --> 00:34:13,554
The parents have
no legal rights.

767
00:34:13,587 --> 00:34:14,821
The pregnancy emancipates her.

768
00:34:14,855 --> 00:34:17,090
There's nothing else you can do.

769
00:34:17,123 --> 00:34:18,625
That girl's head
is so far twisted

770
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:20,426
she doesn't understand
she has a choice.

771
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,195
She doesn't want an abortion.

772
00:34:22,228 --> 00:34:23,597
She doesn't want
to have the baby either.

773
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:26,332
Anyone can see that.
What about misoprostol?

774
00:34:26,366 --> 00:34:28,168
It's used as an abortifacient
all over the world.

775
00:34:28,201 --> 00:34:29,235
Oh, she won't consent to that.

776
00:34:29,269 --> 00:34:30,671
Just, just let it go, Neela.

777
00:34:30,704 --> 00:34:32,673
You're the wrong person
to talk to about this.

778
00:34:34,875 --> 00:34:36,510
Excuse me?

779
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:42,215
I would like your permission
to consult another attending.

780
00:34:44,651 --> 00:34:46,820
Someone who's not Catholic.

781
00:34:52,793 --> 00:34:54,528
Listen to me very seriously.

782
00:34:54,561 --> 00:34:57,698
I'm a doctor first,
above and beyond anything else.

783
00:34:57,731 --> 00:34:59,833
And I don't let
my personal beliefs

784
00:34:59,866 --> 00:35:03,269
get in the way
of a patient's best interests.

785
00:35:03,303 --> 00:35:04,571
Ever!

786
00:35:10,276 --> 00:35:12,846
Now give me that chart
and move on to the next one.

787
00:35:12,879 --> 00:35:14,915
I'm sorry.

788
00:35:14,948 --> 00:35:16,817
It's just that there's got to be
something that we can do.

789
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:18,685
You're done here.

790
00:35:39,405 --> 00:35:43,844
'Do you want to have this baby?'

791
00:35:43,877 --> 00:35:45,345
I have to.

792
00:35:45,378 --> 00:35:47,213
Is it what you want?

793
00:35:50,984 --> 00:35:52,619
No.

794
00:35:52,653 --> 00:35:54,588
No, it isn't.

795
00:36:03,864 --> 00:36:06,166
This is called a laminaria.

796
00:36:07,934 --> 00:36:10,604
'It goes into the cervix'

797
00:36:10,637 --> 00:36:13,574
'where it
absorbs water and swells'

798
00:36:13,607 --> 00:36:15,876
'creating a larger opening.'

799
00:36:20,614 --> 00:36:22,348
'After that happens'

800
00:36:22,382 --> 00:36:25,385
it's possible that the fetus
might fall out.

801
00:36:25,418 --> 00:36:29,455
‐ Possible?
‐ You might have a miscarriage.

802
00:36:29,489 --> 00:36:31,592
‐ Does it hurt?
‐ A little.

803
00:36:31,625 --> 00:36:33,860
There might be some cramping.

804
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,899
Is it a sin?

805
00:36:38,932 --> 00:36:44,270
It's just a...medical way
we have of, uh..

806
00:36:46,873 --> 00:36:49,676
...giving God
a chance to reconsider.

807
00:36:51,745 --> 00:36:53,947
'Abigail Lockhart?'

808
00:37:01,955 --> 00:37:04,625
Oh, my God!
Nobody was out today.

809
00:37:04,658 --> 00:37:05,692
‐ I had a pick of the litter!
‐ Hey, come on.

810
00:37:05,726 --> 00:37:06,827
You gotta leave.
You gotta leave.

811
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:07,894
Hey, what the hell
is wrong with you?

812
00:37:07,928 --> 00:37:09,329
Hey!

813
00:37:11,364 --> 00:37:12,833
Cops are on me.
They're on my ass.

814
00:37:12,866 --> 00:37:14,901
And why? Because your
dick of a husband Bobby's

815
00:37:14,935 --> 00:37:16,603
put out a missing persons
report, that's why.

816
00:37:16,637 --> 00:37:18,404
‐ He did?
‐ Yeah.

817
00:37:18,438 --> 00:37:19,840
How long you think we got
till he traces you to me, huh?

818
00:37:19,873 --> 00:37:21,307
How long you think
before I'm walking around

819
00:37:21,341 --> 00:37:22,509
with my testicles in a jar?

820
00:37:22,543 --> 00:37:24,578
‐ You tell me.
‐ Vicky, Vic, Vic..

821
00:37:24,611 --> 00:37:27,347
Ooh. I love you.

822
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,349
But sometimes you can be
such a little faggot.

823
00:37:29,382 --> 00:37:30,684
‐ Oh, yeah?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

824
00:37:30,717 --> 00:37:32,385
Well, I'm gonna
get a big boyfriend

825
00:37:32,418 --> 00:37:34,588
who's gonna kick
your maniac of a husband's ass.

826
00:37:34,621 --> 00:37:35,889
How do you like that, huh?

827
00:37:35,922 --> 00:37:37,558
Huh? How do you like that?

828
00:37:37,591 --> 00:37:39,860
Hey. Ow!
You're ripping the leather.

829
00:37:41,828 --> 00:37:43,597
Just quiet, will you?

830
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,534
Yeah, that's great.
That's great.

831
00:37:47,568 --> 00:37:50,671
‐ 'You got to pay your tickets.'
‐ Just great, damn it.

832
00:37:50,704 --> 00:37:53,039
Vic, what's going on?

833
00:37:53,073 --> 00:37:55,041
Hey, x‐ray, how's it going?

834
00:37:55,075 --> 00:37:56,476
So this must be Jodie, huh?

835
00:37:57,544 --> 00:38:00,847
Who, her? That's not Jodie.

836
00:38:00,881 --> 00:38:02,883
‐ Hi.
‐ Hi. You know what's weird?

837
00:38:02,916 --> 00:38:04,851
I've parked here a lot of times.
I never had a problem.

838
00:38:04,885 --> 00:38:06,620
Yeah, that's really weird, huh?

839
00:38:06,653 --> 00:38:08,822
‐ But we're gonna take the L.
‐ Alright.

840
00:38:08,855 --> 00:38:10,657
‐ Nice meeting you.
‐ Likewise.

841
00:38:10,691 --> 00:38:12,425
'Yo, Ray.'

842
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:15,562
Bret. Hey, how was practice?

843
00:38:15,596 --> 00:38:17,463
Thanks for meeting me, man.

844
00:38:17,497 --> 00:38:18,699
Can we grab some coffee?

845
00:38:18,732 --> 00:38:20,567
Yeah. So I took care
of everything.

846
00:38:20,601 --> 00:38:22,803
Schedule's all cleared up.

847
00:38:22,836 --> 00:38:24,705
I thought we were gonna talk
before you did anything.

848
00:38:24,738 --> 00:38:26,507
Did something happen?

849
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,374
Don't tell me Ginsberg
isn't interested.

850
00:38:28,408 --> 00:38:31,512
No, it's still on.

851
00:38:31,545 --> 00:38:32,913
Here's the thing, Ray,
you've been pretty busy

852
00:38:32,946 --> 00:38:35,081
with this whole
doctor thing lately

853
00:38:35,115 --> 00:38:36,482
and kind of distracted,
you know?

854
00:38:36,517 --> 00:38:37,684
Oh, true, true.

855
00:38:37,718 --> 00:38:39,553
But I'm 100 percent
on board now, okay?

856
00:38:39,586 --> 00:38:41,021
110, actually.

857
00:38:41,054 --> 00:38:43,824
Well, we all got together
and talked about it.

858
00:38:43,857 --> 00:38:45,592
Who did?

859
00:38:48,028 --> 00:38:51,497
The guys. This morning.

860
00:38:51,532 --> 00:38:53,734
Kind of decided the band's
got to make some changes.

861
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:58,539
Changes?

862
00:39:01,842 --> 00:39:03,710
What do you mean changes?

863
00:39:03,744 --> 00:39:08,114
You'll need to come back to
have the laminaria removed.

864
00:39:08,148 --> 00:39:10,450
Probably feel a little pain

865
00:39:10,483 --> 00:39:11,818
but nothing to worry about.

866
00:39:11,852 --> 00:39:13,954
You can take ibuprofen.
That should help.

867
00:39:17,691 --> 00:39:19,860
"Before I formed thee
in the belly

868
00:39:19,893 --> 00:39:22,095
"I knew thee.

869
00:39:22,128 --> 00:39:24,698
"And before thou camest forth
out of the womb

870
00:39:24,731 --> 00:39:26,132
"I sanctified thee

871
00:39:26,166 --> 00:39:29,069
and ordained thee
a prophet unto the nations."

872
00:39:31,905 --> 00:39:34,541
Jeremiah 1:5.

873
00:39:35,976 --> 00:39:38,979
"Man was born of dust.

874
00:39:39,012 --> 00:39:44,150
"It was only when God
breathed life into Adam

875
00:39:44,184 --> 00:39:47,621
that he became a living soul."

876
00:39:47,654 --> 00:39:50,557
Genesis.

877
00:39:50,591 --> 00:39:52,458
You're a Christian.

878
00:39:59,766 --> 00:40:03,069
What do I tell my mom?

879
00:40:03,103 --> 00:40:05,839
She'll think
you're having a miscarriage.

880
00:40:05,872 --> 00:40:07,874

888

Weaver's MRI results are back.

Taking care

Okay?

897
00:41:26,152 --> 00:41:29,189
Advanced degeneration
with a cartilaginous flap.

898
00:41:30,657 --> 00:41:32,926
At least that explains the pain.

899
00:41:32,959 --> 00:41:34,561
I've seen
that kind of thing heal

900
00:41:34,595 --> 00:41:37,097
with enough bed rest
and physical therapy.

901
00:41:38,832 --> 00:41:40,734
I've been putting this off
for years.

902
00:41:40,767 --> 00:41:43,203
Maybe it's time
to face the music.

903
00:41:43,236 --> 00:41:45,839
I'll need
a total hip replacement.

904
00:41:45,872 --> 00:41:48,274
Not necessarily.

00:41:48,308 --> 00:41:52,078

to run around like a crazy man.

‐ How is he?
‐ He's great.

907
00:41:54,981 --> 00:41:56,016
You should see him.

908
00:41:56,049 --> 00:41:57,618
He looks just like Sandy.

909
00:42:17,137 --> 00:42:18,872
I went by your place

910
00:42:18,905 --> 00:42:21,274
but I figured you might
come home this way.

911
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:31,652
I don't want
everything we have

912
00:42:31,685 --> 00:42:33,720
to come down to
this one decision.

913
00:42:39,225 --> 00:42:40,727
We can get past it.

'You did what you had to do.'

915
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,903
Doesn't mean
we can't be together.

916
00:42:52,205 --> 00:42:54,307
I didn't do it.

917
00:42:57,243 --> 00:42:58,779
I couldn't.

918
00:43:03,249 --> 00:43:05,218
