1
00:00:08,211 --> 00:00:09,678
Stop looking at me.

2
00:00:22,085 --> 00:00:24,919
Mm, pancakes. The Peanut is thrilled.

3
00:00:24,944 --> 00:00:28,070
You are wearing the
maternity jeans I bought you.

4
00:00:28,235 --> 00:00:29,668
Glad you're happy about that.

5
00:00:29,693 --> 00:00:31,259
You're 28 weeks pregnant.

6
00:00:31,284 --> 00:00:33,551
Your weight has increased 21.5 pounds,

7
00:00:33,576 --> 00:00:35,275
and our baby is moving lower.

8
00:00:35,344 --> 00:00:37,678
Hmm. At least there's pancakes.

9
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:39,099
We need to buy a minivan.

10
00:00:39,124 --> 00:00:40,046
No, we don't.

11
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:42,990
The Striped Tomato
has no infant safety features.

12
00:00:43,519 --> 00:00:46,452
Shaun, I just surrendered
to maternity jeans.

13
00:00:46,521 --> 00:00:49,121
This is not the right time
for broaching the "Mom-mobile."

14
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,707
When would be the right time?

15
00:00:52,293 --> 00:00:53,726
These are amazing.

16
00:00:53,761 --> 00:00:55,847
- Did you use buttermilk?
- Greek yogurt.

17
00:00:55,872 --> 00:00:56,929
Mm.

18
00:00:56,964 --> 00:00:59,131
I will e-mail you my
spreadsheet of child-safe vehicles.

19
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,200
We can discuss it on your lunch break.

20
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:18,917
Sonja Baylor?

21
00:01:27,061 --> 00:01:28,761
Wait. Who's the Code Gold?

22
00:01:28,796 --> 00:01:30,462
Is it Taylor Swift?
Did her broken heart finally give out?

23
00:01:30,497 --> 00:01:32,631
Better. Roland Barnes.

24
00:01:34,235 --> 00:01:35,934
The green tech guy?

25
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,069
He was attacked by a tiger.

26
00:01:37,104 --> 00:01:38,603
Sorry. In San Jose?

27
00:01:38,639 --> 00:01:40,906
At his exotic animal rescue
in the Santa Cruz Mountains.

28
00:01:40,941 --> 00:01:42,941
Concierge doctor called to say
they're on their way.

29
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:45,144
San Jose General is much closer.

30
00:01:45,179 --> 00:01:47,612
- Why would he come here?
- Because of you.

31
00:01:47,648 --> 00:01:48,781
Deep chest wall lacerations,

32
00:01:48,816 --> 00:01:51,583
multiple rib fractures,
hemopneumothorax.

33
00:01:51,618 --> 00:01:54,119
I stabilized him and placed a
chest tube, but he needs a CT, stat.

34
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:56,188
- Dr. Kalu.
- Dr. Andrews.

35
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,626
Good to see you, Dr. Murphy.

36
00:02:01,662 --> 00:02:05,297
Oh, hello... Jared.

37
00:02:05,332 --> 00:02:07,365
A famous billionaire and a cute reunion?

38
00:02:07,434 --> 00:02:08,967
This is almost Swift-worthy.

39
00:02:10,786 --> 00:02:18,786
Synced & corrected by -robtor-

40
00:02:21,281 --> 00:02:24,349
Is Leo a decent poker player?

41
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:27,537
<i>Us Weekly</i> has photos of Roland
coming out of his game last week.

42
00:02:28,455 --> 00:02:30,122
Won my Lambo off him.

43
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:35,493
No sign of trauma
to the liver or spleen.

44
00:02:35,529 --> 00:02:38,296
Ugh. Beyonce did a private show
at his birthday?

45
00:02:38,332 --> 00:02:40,298
Ah. It was awesome.

46
00:02:40,334 --> 00:02:42,300
No major intraperitoneal hematoma.

47
00:02:42,336 --> 00:02:44,720
Moving on to the chest.

48
00:02:47,974 --> 00:02:52,243
So, how does one go
from St. Bon's resident

49
00:02:52,268 --> 00:02:54,016
to concierge doctor

50
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,440
for the fifth richest man in the world?

51
00:02:57,383 --> 00:02:58,915
I was working at Denver Memorial

52
00:02:58,984 --> 00:02:59,984
when I met Roland

53
00:03:01,086 --> 00:03:02,947
at a fundraiser hosted by my parents.

54
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:05,889
His wife collapsed
during the silent auction.

55
00:03:05,924 --> 00:03:07,558
Nutmeg allergy.

56
00:03:07,593 --> 00:03:09,860
I gave her an epi and helped
her to outbid John Legend

57
00:03:09,895 --> 00:03:11,595
for a weekend at an underwater hotel.

58
00:03:11,664 --> 00:03:13,029
Well...

59
00:03:13,065 --> 00:03:14,569
Roland hired me that night.

60
00:03:14,638 --> 00:03:17,033
Why does he need a personal physician?

61
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:19,839
Does he often get attacked
by wild animals?

62
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:23,073
Uh, chronic sciatica.

63
00:03:23,108 --> 00:03:26,109
And he travels a lot, you know,
so there's vaccines,

64
00:03:26,178 --> 00:03:29,012
plus BOTOX injections,
cholesterol scripts,

65
00:03:29,047 --> 00:03:30,514
medical advice for friends and family.

66
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:32,516
Why'd you leave St. Bon's?

67
00:03:32,551 --> 00:03:35,419
He was fired for assaulting an
attending who harassed Claire,

68
00:03:35,454 --> 00:03:37,053
and then he sued the hospital.

69
00:03:37,089 --> 00:03:39,055
- You're that guy.
- Yeah.

70
00:03:39,091 --> 00:03:41,591
I hear Andrews is, uh,
not your biggest fan.

71
00:03:41,626 --> 00:03:43,446
Surprised he let me in the building.

72
00:03:45,597 --> 00:03:48,701
Depressed and dislocated sternum,
manubrium, and rib fractures.

73
00:03:49,534 --> 00:03:50,633
They're too fragmented

74
00:03:50,702 --> 00:03:52,496
for a standard sternal reconstruction.

75
00:04:02,447 --> 00:04:04,080
- He still does this, huh?
- Mm.

76
00:04:04,116 --> 00:04:06,010
Always makes my day.

77
00:04:06,651 --> 00:04:08,054
I have an idea.

78
00:04:10,088 --> 00:04:11,766
This is why I brought Roland here.

79
00:04:16,728 --> 00:04:18,189
It's a girl.

80
00:04:18,997 --> 00:04:20,963
We're naming her Esther.

81
00:04:20,998 --> 00:04:23,666
We hope she'll be brave and selfless

82
00:04:23,691 --> 00:04:25,391
like Queen Esther,

83
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,989
baddest bitch in the Bible.

84
00:04:27,405 --> 00:04:28,741
How are the meds going?

85
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,306
Fine.

86
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:32,575
Any excessive discharge?

87
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,176
Oh, a couple of days ago,
I was on a walk,

88
00:04:34,245 --> 00:04:37,375
and it was a little like
I'd peed myself.

89
00:04:39,784 --> 00:04:41,754
Could that be from the MilliDox?

90
00:04:42,754 --> 00:04:45,466
No, you're actually on the placebo.

91
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,458
Your amniotic fluid is a bit low.

92
00:04:48,493 --> 00:04:50,554
We should admit you for further testing.

93
00:04:52,931 --> 00:04:54,196
He asked for you.

94
00:04:54,265 --> 00:04:55,765
Inoperable leiomyosarcoma

95
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,228
with major vascular involvement.

96
00:05:02,306 --> 00:05:03,693
What are you doing here?

97
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:06,487
I'm dying.

98
00:05:09,145 --> 00:05:10,512
My doctors say

99
00:05:10,547 --> 00:05:12,368
that there's nothing they can do for me.

100
00:05:14,718 --> 00:05:15,951
I'm hoping you can.

101
00:05:18,388 --> 00:05:20,789
We should get a CT and a PET scan.

102
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:22,958
Fine.

103
00:05:26,864 --> 00:05:28,630
We will completely rebuild

104
00:05:28,665 --> 00:05:30,331
your sternum and anterior chest wall

105
00:05:30,367 --> 00:05:32,300
with donor bones and titanium plates.

106
00:05:32,335 --> 00:05:34,168
It is a very complicated surgery.

107
00:05:34,204 --> 00:05:36,350
Jared says you're a damn good surgeon.

108
00:05:37,073 --> 00:05:39,908
Yes, I am a damn good surgeon.

109
00:05:39,977 --> 00:05:41,910
He is.

110
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:44,525
And I'll be overseeing your
care every step of the way.

111
00:05:45,549 --> 00:05:47,111
Appreciate the personal attention.

112
00:05:47,484 --> 00:05:48,738
I want Jared there, too.

113
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,851
Jared is my doctor.

114
00:05:50,887 --> 00:05:53,488
Dr. Kalu will be read in
on every major decision.

115
00:05:53,523 --> 00:05:54,889
I want him in the OR.

116
00:05:58,261 --> 00:06:01,083
I will fast-track
your surgical privileges.

117
00:06:18,448 --> 00:06:20,144
Something's going on between you two.

118
00:06:21,617 --> 00:06:23,272
I'm very perceptive that way.

119
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,454
- It's a long story.
- Hmm.

120
00:06:27,623 --> 00:06:29,457
I saw on his chart he's from Phoenix,

121
00:06:29,526 --> 00:06:31,191
and he broke his arm a couple years ago

122
00:06:31,226 --> 00:06:33,726
at a Tae Kwon Do match, your sport.

123
00:06:33,762 --> 00:06:37,030
So, I'm gonna go with
he's your Johnny Lawrence

124
00:06:37,066 --> 00:06:39,599
who cheated during your match
at the All Valley tournament.

125
00:06:39,634 --> 00:06:41,957
I've been watching a lot of<i> Cobra Kai.</i>

126
00:06:43,872 --> 00:06:45,305
He slept with my wife,

127
00:06:45,374 --> 00:06:48,506
so yes to the cheating,
no to the tournament.

128
00:06:58,554 --> 00:07:00,392
This is from six months ago.

129
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:04,814
This is from today.

130
00:07:06,228 --> 00:07:08,795
A leiomyosarcoma should have
progressed more than that.

131
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,597
Yeah, maybe they had
the diagnosis wrong.

132
00:07:20,031 --> 00:07:22,464
Release the pectoral
muscles from the attachment medially.

133
00:07:22,577 --> 00:07:26,245
Should I place the low-profile plate?

134
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,504
Don't you need to create
a landing zone for the fixation?

135
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,050
He is right.

136
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:36,089
Get better exposure by elevating

137
00:07:36,124 --> 00:07:38,305
the right pectoral muscle from the ribs.

138
00:07:39,995 --> 00:07:42,795
I understand SF General's cardiac unit

139
00:07:42,831 --> 00:07:44,463
is named after your boss

140
00:07:44,499 --> 00:07:47,898
and that he sponsored a surgical
exchange program with Haiti.

141
00:07:49,871 --> 00:07:51,485
Dr. Kalu, would you
like to place the screws?

142
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:54,607
Very much so.

143
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:56,907
Thank you, Dr. Andrews.

144
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:00,789
Drill guide, self-tapping screws.

145
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:06,485
Feels good.

146
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:10,889
You have been very polite to Dr. Kalu,

147
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,025
despite having fired him.

148
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,968
Is that only because you want
a donation from Roland?

149
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:19,865
- It's okay. You don't...
- It's true.

150
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,900
Dr. Kalu and I did not part
on the best of terms,

151
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:24,435
but I'm happy you found your niche.

152
00:08:25,473 --> 00:08:27,339
And I believe in the work we do here,

153
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:30,309
and Roland Barnes
can help us do even more.

154
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:32,811
I told Roland this was
the best hospital in the state.

155
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:33,979
When we get him healthy,

156
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,446
I'll be happy to tell him again.

157
00:08:38,653 --> 00:08:41,186
BP's dropping. Cardiac output is awful.

158
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:42,543
He's in heart failure.

159
00:08:42,568 --> 00:08:44,211
The cardiac contusion must
have been too small to spot on CT.

160
00:08:44,236 --> 00:08:45,803
He needs a balloon pump

161
00:08:45,828 --> 00:08:47,761
to help his heart circulate more blood.

162
00:08:47,786 --> 00:08:50,169
And we need to get it in the
next five minutes, or he dies.

163
00:08:54,777 --> 00:08:56,110
BP has stabilized.

164
00:08:56,145 --> 00:08:58,245
Cardiac output is improving.

165
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,109
He should make a full recovery,

166
00:09:00,178 --> 00:09:02,623
but he should not get so close
to jungle cats in the future.

167
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,196
In the... In the OR,
I really missed that.

168
00:09:09,526 --> 00:09:12,561
Then why did you stop being a surgeon?

169
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:14,152
Um, working for Roland

170
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:16,452
was too interesting
an opportunity to pass up.

171
00:09:16,527 --> 00:09:18,627
Is sciatica interesting to you?

172
00:09:18,696 --> 00:09:20,262
No, it's more, um...

173
00:09:20,297 --> 00:09:22,030
- I came as soon as I heard.
- Hey.

174
00:09:22,065 --> 00:09:23,398
Poor Rolly.

175
00:09:23,434 --> 00:09:25,634
Uh, Shaun, this is my girlfriend Dalia.

176
00:09:25,703 --> 00:09:26,735
Hi.

177
00:09:27,798 --> 00:09:28,798
You...

178
00:09:29,773 --> 00:09:32,027
I have seen you on the bus

179
00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:34,404
in a-a perfume ad.

180
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,449
Fern test confirms

181
00:09:41,484 --> 00:09:43,302
it's a premature rupture
of the membranes.

182
00:09:43,337 --> 00:09:45,486
We should terminate
before an infection sets in.

183
00:09:45,555 --> 00:09:47,055
What about in-patient expectant

184
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,623
management and antibiotics?

185
00:09:48,658 --> 00:09:50,959
PPROM pregnancies
can be carried to term.

186
00:09:50,994 --> 00:09:52,961
Rarely, and when they are,
babies are likely to have

187
00:09:52,996 --> 00:09:54,729
cerebral palsy,
neurologic abnormalities,

188
00:09:54,765 --> 00:09:56,230
intellectual disability...

189
00:09:56,265 --> 00:09:59,234
Which we'll tell the parents,
but this is a badly-wanted pregnancy.

190
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:01,236
They've been trying to conceive
for five years,

191
00:10:01,271 --> 00:10:03,738
had two first-trimester
miscarriages already.

192
00:10:03,774 --> 00:10:05,439
Saving the baby may be her priority.

193
00:10:05,475 --> 00:10:07,479
But saving her is ours.

194
00:10:07,978 --> 00:10:10,145
Sonja is our patient.

195
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,277
We should explain her options
but recommend termination.

196
00:10:15,517 --> 00:10:19,419
Morgan is right,
but be clear about the options.

197
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,292
The seat springs allow the car seat

198
00:10:25,327 --> 00:10:26,957
to move more than one inch,

199
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:30,197
which creates additional injury risk.

200
00:10:30,266 --> 00:10:33,366
There are no over-shoulder seat
belts in the back for the car seat,

201
00:10:33,435 --> 00:10:36,636
no crumple zone, and you
would have to install a roll cage,

202
00:10:36,672 --> 00:10:39,439
which still would not be as
reliable as one built into the vehicle.

203
00:10:39,474 --> 00:10:41,474
Since you hate minivans,

204
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:44,808
I have looked into hatchbacks and
SUVs with sufficient safety features.

205
00:10:45,514 --> 00:10:48,186
It's not just about hating minivans.

206
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:51,284
- What is it about?
- I love this car.

207
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,786
It's my history.

208
00:10:52,821 --> 00:10:54,721
My brother and I restored it,

209
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,723
used to drive it to shows
at The Fillmore.

210
00:10:56,792 --> 00:10:59,125
You and I took it on our
first road trip. I can't sell it.

211
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,696
Then... we do not have to.

212
00:11:02,731 --> 00:11:04,464
As long as you never put
the Peanut in it.

213
00:11:04,499 --> 00:11:05,799
We still need a family car.

214
00:11:05,834 --> 00:11:07,914
Yeah, we do.

215
00:11:10,972 --> 00:11:12,305
Roland's awake.

216
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:20,844
But it's possible that
we could save our baby?

217
00:11:21,749 --> 00:11:23,148
You'd have to live here.

218
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,416
We'd monitor you every day

219
00:11:24,485 --> 00:11:26,752
and give you prophylactic
antibiotics and steroids

220
00:11:26,821 --> 00:11:28,920
when the baby gets closer to viability.

221
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:31,724
To be clear, even with all of that,

222
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:34,560
you may still develop
a serious uterine infection

223
00:11:34,595 --> 00:11:36,595
that could require a hysterectomy

224
00:11:36,664 --> 00:11:38,764
or cause fatal complications.

225
00:11:45,072 --> 00:11:46,787
I think we should terminate.

226
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:54,795
What would you do...

227
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,882
if it was your baby?

228
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,950
Termination is the safest.

229
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,802
I was talking to Dr. Allen.

230
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,460
I would...

231
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,229
pray on it.

232
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,200
And then?

233
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:20,904
I want to know what you would do.

234
00:12:35,587 --> 00:12:37,879
I think I...

235
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:41,391
would try to save the baby.

236
00:12:47,966 --> 00:12:50,725
We have to fight for our Esther.

237
00:12:59,077 --> 00:13:00,509
We'd need a biopsy

238
00:13:00,578 --> 00:13:02,737
before we can give you
any definitive answer.

239
00:13:04,315 --> 00:13:05,782
Okay.

240
00:13:06,451 --> 00:13:07,742
So, when do we do that?

241
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:12,020
I'll give you a detailed referral
to take to another doctor.

242
00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:14,256
If I wanted to go to another doctor,
I would have.

243
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:15,324
I don't have to keep treating you.

244
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:16,425
But you will.

245
00:13:18,195 --> 00:13:19,379
You're not a quitter.

246
00:13:20,665 --> 00:13:22,965
You worked your ass off
to save your marriage.

247
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,759
You never tapped out in a fight. You...

248
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,888
I always admired your persistence.

249
00:13:29,607 --> 00:13:31,206
I kinda hated it, too.

250
00:13:38,515 --> 00:13:40,150
Looking back at my life...

251
00:13:42,118 --> 00:13:44,237
I don't like the view.

252
00:13:46,656 --> 00:13:50,619
I hurt... a lot of people.

253
00:13:53,997 --> 00:13:55,665
That's the real reason that I came here.

254
00:13:57,801 --> 00:13:59,300
For forgiveness.

255
00:14:12,247 --> 00:14:14,681
The intra-aortic balloon pump worked.

256
00:14:14,717 --> 00:14:16,049
You won't need a new heart.

257
00:14:16,084 --> 00:14:17,851
Great.

258
00:14:17,887 --> 00:14:19,252
So, when can I get out of here?

259
00:14:19,321 --> 00:14:21,922
Oh, not for a few days.

260
00:14:21,991 --> 00:14:23,657
We will need to monitor you

261
00:14:23,692 --> 00:14:25,692
for post-surgical complications.

262
00:14:25,728 --> 00:14:27,694
Your heart rate is elevated.

263
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,029
Have you been exerting yourself?

264
00:14:35,938 --> 00:14:37,624
She did most of the exerting.

265
00:14:40,843 --> 00:14:42,208
Okay.

266
00:14:42,244 --> 00:14:44,410
I need 1,000 milligrams levetiracetam

267
00:14:44,445 --> 00:14:46,591
and 4 milligrams lorazepam, stat!

268
00:14:47,582 --> 00:14:49,402
Is Rolly gonna be okay?

269
00:15:01,677 --> 00:15:03,215
Roland had a seizure.

270
00:15:04,647 --> 00:15:07,720
You... should sit down.

271
00:15:19,261 --> 00:15:20,774
Dalia was there.

272
00:15:22,724 --> 00:15:23,724
Naked.

273
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,947
They were having sex.

274
00:15:33,576 --> 00:15:35,122
Dalia and I aren't together.

275
00:15:35,845 --> 00:15:37,243
She's with Roland.

276
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,245
It's part of the gig.

277
00:15:39,281 --> 00:15:41,081
I pretend she's with me so Roland's wife

278
00:15:41,116 --> 00:15:43,088
doesn't get suspicious
that Dalia's always around.

279
00:15:44,739 --> 00:15:45,739
Oh.

280
00:15:46,788 --> 00:15:48,588
You think that sex
brought on the seizure?

281
00:15:48,623 --> 00:15:52,096
Oh. Arousal can increase
the heart rate by 38%,

282
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,086
and if his brain
was also deprived of oxygen,

283
00:15:54,122 --> 00:15:55,922
it could cause a seizure,
which would mean his heart

284
00:15:55,957 --> 00:15:57,937
is still not pumping enough blood.

285
00:15:59,428 --> 00:16:03,196
Does it bother you to have
to lie on a regular basis?

286
00:16:03,231 --> 00:16:06,132
It's not my favorite responsibility,
but it's a great job, so...

287
00:16:06,201 --> 00:16:07,738
Why is it a great job?

288
00:16:12,674 --> 00:16:15,788
On my last day, Shaun, you told
me that one day I will be very happy.

289
00:16:16,577 --> 00:16:18,243
But I was miserable.

290
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:19,667
I felt like a failure.

291
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:24,296
And then I met Roland,
and he saw something in me,

292
00:16:25,653 --> 00:16:29,154
this guy that I really admired,
that the world admired.

293
00:16:29,223 --> 00:16:31,845
You know, he... he valued me.

294
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,461
And I certainly don't mind
flying private to Amsterdam

295
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:37,796
to have rijsttafel with
the Queen of the Netherlands.

296
00:16:37,832 --> 00:16:40,604
I also said you would
fulfill your potential.

297
00:16:41,682 --> 00:16:43,011
And I'm not doing that?

298
00:16:43,496 --> 00:16:44,496
No.

299
00:16:46,741 --> 00:16:48,070
Sciatica?

300
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,493
Thanks for reminding me
I'm still a failure.

301
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,851
I'll get the BNP test and echo
and check out his heart.

302
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:09,427
Inject saline
to get us to submucosal plane.

303
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:15,165
Why'd you stay on the case?

304
00:17:15,408 --> 00:17:16,765
There's the tumor.

305
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:20,371
He was right.
I take my obligations seriously.

306
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,687
Take four samples.

307
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:26,877
Not because some part of you
wants to forgive him?

308
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:28,694
Withdraw the scope slowly.

309
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,966
He doesn't deserve it.

310
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:40,524
Let's start with a sofa.

311
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,125
Let's take a look.

312
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,711
Finally, somebody recognizes
my interior design genius.

313
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:47,363
Looks nice.

314
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,700
Hey, I love this. I'll take it.

315
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,235
No.

316
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,337
This is literally
the first thing you've sat on.

317
00:17:54,372 --> 00:17:57,541
Okay, I'll sit in ten other ones,
and then I'll take this one.

318
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,267
No. If you know you like something,
stick with it.

319
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,687
Like my car.

320
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,582
Shaun wants to buy a minivan.

321
00:18:06,651 --> 00:18:09,986
And what, you want to put
your infant in a '75 Gran Torino?

322
00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:12,738
No. It's not safe for a baby.

323
00:18:13,764 --> 00:18:14,764
But...

324
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,368
it is...

325
00:18:19,397 --> 00:18:20,397
cool.

326
00:18:21,766 --> 00:18:26,769
Even when I am going
to my super grown-up job

327
00:18:26,838 --> 00:18:29,421
in my lady-boss pantsuit,

328
00:18:30,575 --> 00:18:34,076
I get to get out of that car,
and I'm cool.

329
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:40,182
And soon, I will be
just another 30-something mom

330
00:18:40,217 --> 00:18:41,517
in a practical car

331
00:18:41,552 --> 00:18:44,453
with a baby seat in the back
and spit-up on my shirt.

332
00:18:46,858 --> 00:18:49,224
Maddie's mom used to warn me
to take two shirts

333
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:51,560
whenever I went out with the baby.

334
00:18:51,596 --> 00:18:54,255
- I had to learn the hard way.
- How?

335
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:57,783
H-How do I want this baby so badly,

336
00:18:58,536 --> 00:19:02,246
but feel so icked out by being a mom?

337
00:19:03,774 --> 00:19:05,332
Define "icked out."

338
00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:06,809
Like...

339
00:19:08,211 --> 00:19:09,377
mnh.

340
00:19:09,412 --> 00:19:11,813
I don't know.

341
00:19:11,882 --> 00:19:13,781
Okay, that's well said.

342
00:19:13,817 --> 00:19:14,916
I don't know.

343
00:19:14,951 --> 00:19:16,484
Hey, you got mixed emotions.

344
00:19:16,553 --> 00:19:18,220
Welcome to the human condition.

345
00:19:19,222 --> 00:19:21,056
I'm gonna take this one.

346
00:19:25,294 --> 00:19:27,395
Her fever's hiked.
She's in a lot of pain.

347
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:31,132
Her heart rate's 117. Fetal heart
rate 180. They're both tachycardic.

348
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:34,194
500 milligrams acetaminophen
and start ampicillin.

349
00:19:37,908 --> 00:19:40,784
This is the infection
we were worried about.

350
00:19:42,011 --> 00:19:46,165
Your baby is very unlikely to survive,

351
00:19:46,749 --> 00:19:48,500
and your life is in danger.

352
00:19:49,419 --> 00:19:51,285
We need to terminate now.

353
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:56,623
But her heart's still beating.

354
00:19:56,659 --> 00:20:00,294
Esther can only stay alive in utero,

355
00:20:00,329 --> 00:20:04,600
and as long as she's in there,
you'll keep getting sicker.

356
00:20:06,602 --> 00:20:08,020
I'm so sorry.

357
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,609
I'm here. We can get through this.

358
00:20:14,443 --> 00:20:15,944
We can try again.

359
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:23,302
No.

360
00:20:28,723 --> 00:20:33,326
Your baby needs at least
two more weeks to be viable,

361
00:20:33,361 --> 00:20:36,799
and if we wait that long,
you will probably die.

362
00:20:37,966 --> 00:20:40,219
"If I perish, I perish."

363
00:20:41,069 --> 00:20:42,569
That's what Queen Esther said

364
00:20:42,637 --> 00:20:44,848
before she risked her life
to save her family.

365
00:20:47,161 --> 00:20:48,161
Sonja.

366
00:20:49,477 --> 00:20:50,896
"If I perish...

367
00:20:54,415 --> 00:20:55,901
I perish."

368
00:21:03,491 --> 00:21:06,391
According to your BNP test and echo,

369
00:21:06,427 --> 00:21:09,261
your seizure was not related
to heart trauma.

370
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:11,062
The EEG will let us assess your brain.

371
00:21:11,098 --> 00:21:12,764
So, what's your pitch?

372
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:15,671
Hospital presidents
don't supervise EEGs.

373
00:21:18,405 --> 00:21:20,105
I've been very impressed

374
00:21:20,174 --> 00:21:22,340
by your Global Engineers Initiative,

375
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:24,609
and I think we can do
the same thing with medicine,

376
00:21:24,677 --> 00:21:26,710
train doctors from the developing world

377
00:21:26,746 --> 00:21:28,212
to take care of their own people.

378
00:21:28,248 --> 00:21:30,185
What makes St. Bon's the place to do it?

379
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,016
We're very hands-on here.

380
00:21:32,051 --> 00:21:34,519
Our residents don't just
do appies and lap choles.

381
00:21:34,554 --> 00:21:36,287
With the guidance of our attendings,

382
00:21:36,356 --> 00:21:38,189
they come up with
complex treatment solutions,

383
00:21:38,224 --> 00:21:40,424
untangle the thorniest ethical dilemmas,

384
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:43,427
and learn how to provide
top-notch patient care.

385
00:21:43,463 --> 00:21:45,696
If we could sponsor more residents

386
00:21:45,731 --> 00:21:47,765
from the developing world,

387
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,034
we'll send them home ready
to serve their communities.

388
00:21:50,069 --> 00:21:52,537
But Jared, who I trust with my life,

389
00:21:52,572 --> 00:21:54,104
wasn't good enough to be
one of those residents.

390
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,627
You fired him.

391
00:21:57,409 --> 00:21:59,376
You saw something in him I missed.

392
00:21:59,411 --> 00:22:00,777
- Mm.
- But I'm seeing it now,

393
00:22:00,812 --> 00:22:02,009
and I've granted him full access.

394
00:22:02,481 --> 00:22:03,746
That's a very politic answer.

395
00:22:03,782 --> 00:22:05,804
What do you think, Jared?
Has he earned my money?

396
00:22:08,587 --> 00:22:10,420
I learned a tremendous amount
here at St. Bon's,

397
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:12,722
and as you've experienced,
the care is top-notch.

398
00:22:12,757 --> 00:22:14,991
Mm, unfortunately, the food isn't.

399
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:18,094
Oh, text Dalia and ask her to
bring us back some of those, um,

400
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:20,897
pork buns from Yank Sing. Ohh.

401
00:22:20,932 --> 00:22:22,131
Dalia went into the city?

402
00:22:22,167 --> 00:22:23,766
Mm-hmm, to meet up with friends.

403
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:25,073
And you're okay with that?

404
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,768
Why wouldn't I be?

405
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:27,971
No reason.

406
00:22:28,706 --> 00:22:30,372
Uh, all right.

407
00:22:30,575 --> 00:22:33,123
Let's start this.
Close your eyes and relax.

408
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:38,180
Labs confirm Sonja has chorioamnionitis.

409
00:22:38,249 --> 00:22:39,726
We should add gentamicin.

410
00:22:39,762 --> 00:22:41,584
That would damage the baby's kidneys.

411
00:22:41,619 --> 00:22:43,419
It's our only way to keep Sonja alive,

412
00:22:43,454 --> 00:22:46,136
and it buys us time
to convince her to terminate.

413
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,623
She's being suicidal.

414
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:48,924
Risking your life for your child

415
00:22:48,959 --> 00:22:50,492
is usually considered admirable.

416
00:22:50,528 --> 00:22:53,128
Not if you're both going to die...

417
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,129
because of the false hope you gave her.

418
00:22:55,164 --> 00:22:56,698
I answered a patient's question.

419
00:22:56,766 --> 00:22:57,998
You gave her permission.

420
00:22:58,034 --> 00:23:00,435
We're supposed to at least
try to be objective.

421
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:03,638
Objectivity is a myth,
especially on this subject.

422
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:05,530
I know the pain Sonja's grappling with.

423
00:23:06,142 --> 00:23:07,507
So do I.

424
00:23:13,983 --> 00:23:16,951
I was in med school, on birth control,

425
00:23:16,986 --> 00:23:19,503
and I got pregnant anyway.

426
00:23:21,991 --> 00:23:23,715
I wasn't ready for a kid.

427
00:23:24,827 --> 00:23:26,385
I was scared...

428
00:23:27,329 --> 00:23:28,637
and sad...

429
00:23:30,232 --> 00:23:31,640
and relieved.

430
00:23:32,468 --> 00:23:34,635
It was medical procedure
I had years ago,

431
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:36,019
and I'm at peace with it now.

432
00:23:36,672 --> 00:23:38,271
Most women are.

433
00:23:39,207 --> 00:23:41,007
Because it was their choice.

434
00:23:41,055 --> 00:23:43,248
A choice you got to make,
and I did, too.

435
00:23:43,812 --> 00:23:45,345
Let Sonja make hers.

436
00:23:45,381 --> 00:23:48,240
It's not our job
to help patients choose death.

437
00:23:52,354 --> 00:23:53,870
Her lungs are failing.

438
00:24:02,221 --> 00:24:04,807
- Her O2 sets are falling.
- Fever's climbing.

439
00:24:05,276 --> 00:24:06,475
Intubation cart.

440
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,310
Administer propofol and rocuronium.

441
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:10,980
Hey, we need to sedate you
so we can intubate.

442
00:24:11,015 --> 00:24:13,616
That'll keep you breathing,
but the only way to...

443
00:24:13,651 --> 00:24:15,751
No. You can't kill her.

444
00:24:15,797 --> 00:24:18,276
Esther's life before mine.

445
00:24:18,301 --> 00:24:20,099
- Sonja, please.
- Promise me.

446
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:22,760
- I can't.
- Promise me.

447
00:24:31,948 --> 00:24:33,280
Anthony.

448
00:24:38,341 --> 00:24:39,975
I p...

449
00:24:40,156 --> 00:24:41,488
I promise.

450
00:24:44,882 --> 00:24:45,947
I love you.

451
00:24:57,633 --> 00:24:59,588
Shaun, check out the activity
in the left frontal lobe

452
00:24:59,612 --> 00:25:00,601
from Roland's EEG.

453
00:25:00,637 --> 00:25:02,170
Interictal spikes.

454
00:25:02,205 --> 00:25:04,806
They are very small, likely incidental.

455
00:25:04,841 --> 00:25:06,007
Hmm.

456
00:25:06,042 --> 00:25:08,877
Roland's selfish and possessive.

457
00:25:08,945 --> 00:25:10,678
He hates it when people
have fun without him,

458
00:25:10,713 --> 00:25:13,148
but today he was totally fine with Dalia

459
00:25:13,183 --> 00:25:14,802
hanging out with friends
while he's stuck here.

460
00:25:15,485 --> 00:25:17,886
Being unselfish is a symptom.

461
00:25:17,954 --> 00:25:19,487
Maybe one of his wounds got infected.

462
00:25:19,522 --> 00:25:22,056
Bacterial encephalitis
from the claws or teeth.

463
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:24,159
This could be subtle edema.

464
00:25:24,194 --> 00:25:26,161
Plus behavioral changes
and interictal spikes.

465
00:25:26,196 --> 00:25:27,996
That sounds like neurocysticercosis.

466
00:25:28,031 --> 00:25:30,067
- A tapeworm cyst.
- With larva in the brain.

467
00:25:32,121 --> 00:25:34,153
But it would take a tapeworm weeks

468
00:25:34,177 --> 00:25:36,347
to fully form larva
and a cyst in his brain.

469
00:25:36,372 --> 00:25:38,242
The attack was two days ago.

470
00:25:40,476 --> 00:25:41,875
Ooh.

471
00:25:41,911 --> 00:25:45,379
Roland's last local safari
was about two months ago,

472
00:25:45,415 --> 00:25:47,710
and he fell into
a giant pile of tiger crap.

473
00:25:48,518 --> 00:25:50,751
We can remove the cyst and larva

474
00:25:50,776 --> 00:25:53,443
with stereotactic navigation
and hydrodissection.

475
00:25:53,523 --> 00:25:55,092
- Awesome.
- Oh!

476
00:25:58,661 --> 00:26:00,097
You're not a failure.

477
00:26:05,974 --> 00:26:10,149
Seriously? Four guesses?
I got it in two.

478
00:26:12,441 --> 00:26:13,611
What's up with you?

479
00:26:14,877 --> 00:26:16,113
You lose a patient?

480
00:26:18,594 --> 00:26:19,992
Actually, I might save one.

481
00:26:22,417 --> 00:26:23,417
Joe.

482
00:26:24,186 --> 00:26:25,186
Mia's Joe?

483
00:26:26,588 --> 00:26:28,667
Waiting on his biopsy results.

484
00:26:29,925 --> 00:26:31,524
He asked me to forgive him.

485
00:26:32,694 --> 00:26:34,090
What did you say?

486
00:26:34,529 --> 00:26:36,008
I refused.

487
00:26:38,033 --> 00:26:39,033
You would have, too.

488
00:26:39,067 --> 00:26:40,805
Hmm, well, maybe.

489
00:26:42,427 --> 00:26:44,604
Then again, I am capable
of letting things go.

490
00:26:44,639 --> 00:26:46,310
I can let things go.

491
00:26:47,141 --> 00:26:49,242
I prioritized my career for a day,

492
00:26:49,277 --> 00:26:51,357
which you decided was unacceptable,

493
00:26:51,713 --> 00:26:53,692
even after I changed my mind.

494
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:58,239
And how long did it take you
to forgive Mia?

495
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,220
Dr. Park.

496
00:27:03,651 --> 00:27:05,162
Your diagnosis is in.

497
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,232
Right this way, guys.

498
00:27:14,268 --> 00:27:17,102
Be careful. You've got history
you're carrying right there.

499
00:27:20,941 --> 00:27:22,908
There's a couple of steps. Be careful.

500
00:27:22,943 --> 00:27:24,723
Thanks, guys. First door on the right.

501
00:27:25,513 --> 00:27:26,645
Stadium seats?

502
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,448
Authentic Candlestick Park
stadium seats.

503
00:27:29,483 --> 00:27:31,016
Got them from a broker.

504
00:27:31,084 --> 00:27:32,851
- Very cool.
- Right?

505
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,526
- Thank you for the inspiration.
- You're welcome.

506
00:27:36,657 --> 00:27:39,238
Your turn next. Get your coat.

507
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:44,596
You have a stromal tumor in your stomach

508
00:27:44,632 --> 00:27:46,864
and a small lesion on your liver.

509
00:27:46,933 --> 00:27:48,456
And we can remove both.

510
00:27:49,135 --> 00:27:50,416
You'll be cancer-free.

511
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:53,137
Hmm.

512
00:27:55,811 --> 00:27:58,042
T-That's incredible.

513
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,276
Thank you.

514
00:28:00,674 --> 00:28:02,573
You get it, right?

515
00:28:02,782 --> 00:28:04,221
You're not dying.

516
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:06,184
Yes.

517
00:28:07,554 --> 00:28:09,018
This is amazing.

518
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,480
I'm so grateful.

519
00:28:14,727 --> 00:28:17,161
- But it...
- That's not why you came here.

520
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:38,849
Sonja will likely
be in multi-organ failure

521
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:41,258
within the next 48 hours.

522
00:28:41,283 --> 00:28:44,345
And when that happens,
Esther will not survive.

523
00:28:46,137 --> 00:28:50,142
But if we terminate now,
Sonja still can.

524
00:28:51,436 --> 00:28:53,938
You can save your wife's life.

525
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:56,774
It's all up to you.

526
00:29:10,581 --> 00:29:11,747
He says...

527
00:29:13,417 --> 00:29:15,000
He says he can't do it.

528
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:18,504
He needs to keep his promise.

529
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:25,052
I know what to do.

530
00:29:38,296 --> 00:29:40,696
- Sorry, man.
- Bring it.

531
00:29:53,744 --> 00:29:55,117
You okay?

532
00:30:05,855 --> 00:30:08,055
A worm laid eggs in my skull?

533
00:30:08,091 --> 00:30:09,857
Larva.

534
00:30:09,893 --> 00:30:13,010
You were right. Murphy's the best.

535
00:30:14,691 --> 00:30:17,791
What would you say to $100 million?

536
00:30:22,277 --> 00:30:26,412
I'd say that's remarkably
generous, uh, but...

537
00:30:26,609 --> 00:30:28,066
You can't accept it.

538
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:32,786
You are not medically fit to be
making any major decisions

539
00:30:32,811 --> 00:30:34,877
because of the larva.

540
00:30:34,902 --> 00:30:38,237
I closed a huge deal last week
with Mr. Worm as my consigliere.

541
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,945
I feel pretty competent.

542
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:44,207
Well, I'd be happy to accept
your money after the surgery.

543
00:30:55,294 --> 00:30:57,394
Sonja, it's okay.

544
00:30:57,419 --> 00:30:59,347
I turned off your sedation.

545
00:31:01,142 --> 00:31:02,392
I need to talk to you.

546
00:31:03,043 --> 00:31:04,343
I'm gonna let go of your hands,

547
00:31:04,368 --> 00:31:05,967
but you can't pull out the tube.

548
00:31:20,881 --> 00:31:22,829
When I was 18,

549
00:31:24,205 --> 00:31:25,457
I had an abortion.

550
00:31:28,449 --> 00:31:32,089
That child would have been 11 now,

551
00:31:32,953 --> 00:31:34,508
just starting middle school.

552
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:38,762
Every time I see a kid that age,

553
00:31:39,913 --> 00:31:42,474
I think about who they would have become

554
00:31:43,283 --> 00:31:45,685
or what kind of mom I would have been.

555
00:31:48,602 --> 00:31:50,816
I believe God's forgiven me.

556
00:31:51,992 --> 00:31:53,735
That's kinda His thing.

557
00:31:55,849 --> 00:31:59,032
And I believe God picked you
for motherhood.

558
00:32:01,254 --> 00:32:02,702
You are so strong,

559
00:32:03,743 --> 00:32:05,914
so brave,

560
00:32:06,306 --> 00:32:09,292
with such a deep capacity for love.

561
00:32:15,888 --> 00:32:20,157
But your Esther isn't developed enough

562
00:32:20,182 --> 00:32:22,182
to survive outside of the womb.

563
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:25,976
The infection will kill both of you.

564
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:33,525
I told you if I were you,
I would try to save the baby.

565
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:38,446
I prayed for a miracle.

566
00:32:40,945 --> 00:32:42,951
And I don't know
why it didn't come today.

567
00:32:47,392 --> 00:32:52,377
The only way for you to be
the mom God wants you to be...

568
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,393
is to let Esther go.

569
00:33:12,564 --> 00:33:14,816
Please sign this consent form.

570
00:33:52,085 --> 00:33:54,469
_

571
00:34:06,656 --> 00:34:07,656
Yes.

572
00:34:20,753 --> 00:34:21,885
Speculum.

573
00:34:44,172 --> 00:34:46,491
If your soul
has not yet left your body...

574
00:34:49,097 --> 00:34:50,830
I baptize you, Esther.

575
00:35:05,412 --> 00:35:08,430
Cervix is sufficiently dilated.

576
00:35:21,195 --> 00:35:22,694
In the name of the Father...

577
00:35:23,865 --> 00:35:25,179
and of the Son...

578
00:35:27,635 --> 00:35:29,284
and of the Holy Spirit.

579
00:35:33,207 --> 00:35:34,456
Amen.

580
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,411
- Amen. Amen.
- Amen.

581
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,480
- Amen.
- Amen.

582
00:36:07,761 --> 00:36:09,126
The margins were clean.

583
00:36:09,162 --> 00:36:10,600
We were able to get all the tumors.

584
00:36:11,431 --> 00:36:13,024
No additional metastasis.

585
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,818
Your prognosis is excellent.

586
00:36:17,671 --> 00:36:18,671
Thank you.

587
00:36:30,383 --> 00:36:31,449
I forgive you.

588
00:36:43,996 --> 00:36:45,264
Thank you.

589
00:36:54,306 --> 00:36:57,217
Extracting the cyst...

590
00:36:58,577 --> 00:36:59,810
and larva.

591
00:36:59,845 --> 00:37:01,614
Awesome.

592
00:37:02,452 --> 00:37:05,159
- And I might hurl.
- Let's close.

593
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:09,372
Can Dr. Kalu do the closing?

594
00:37:10,688 --> 00:37:11,958
Be my guest.

595
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,421
4-0 NUROLON.

596
00:37:20,231 --> 00:37:22,698
You said you missed being a surgeon.

597
00:37:22,734 --> 00:37:25,735
If you complete your residency here,

598
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:27,431
you can do more than closing.

599
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,413
I doubt he wants to go
from five-star restaurants

600
00:37:30,438 --> 00:37:31,894
to hospital vending machines.

601
00:37:32,971 --> 00:37:36,906
Actually... someone, um,
helped me realize

602
00:37:36,931 --> 00:37:38,196
that I'd love a second chance here.

603
00:37:47,157 --> 00:37:48,656
The Chief of Surgery's responsible

604
00:37:48,681 --> 00:37:50,913
for all hiring decisions
in her department.

605
00:37:54,198 --> 00:37:56,085
I've, uh... I've learned
a lot about myself,

606
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:58,567
how to better communicate,

607
00:37:58,602 --> 00:38:00,569
how to manage challenging personalities.

608
00:38:00,604 --> 00:38:01,870
Hmm.

609
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:04,806
I hear Roland can be a handful.

610
00:38:04,831 --> 00:38:06,971
Prepared me for tough patients
and tougher attendings.

611
00:38:09,193 --> 00:38:11,360
And my surgical skills are still sharp.

612
00:38:11,494 --> 00:38:13,436
Andrews actually
let me do Roland's closing.

613
00:38:13,883 --> 00:38:15,229
I'm impressed.

614
00:38:15,972 --> 00:38:19,000
Murphy really wants you on his team.
That carries weight.

615
00:38:20,609 --> 00:38:22,945
But I don't have any openings
for third-year residents.

616
00:38:26,729 --> 00:38:27,729
I understand.

617
00:38:31,734 --> 00:38:34,248
But I do have a slot for a first-year.

618
00:38:57,673 --> 00:39:01,233
I-I'm so sorry for your loss.

619
00:39:22,196 --> 00:39:24,298
So our Esther will always be with me.

620
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:29,790
Someday,

621
00:39:31,413 --> 00:39:34,517
maybe we can tell her
brothers and sisters all about her.

622
00:39:51,066 --> 00:39:52,066
Oh.

623
00:39:52,647 --> 00:39:54,313
Aw yee...

624
00:39:54,348 --> 00:39:57,182
This car is perfect for the Peanut.

625
00:39:57,217 --> 00:40:00,085
- And pretty cool, too.
- Aw yee...

626
00:40:00,154 --> 00:40:02,837
Oh, let's take this
rocket ship for a ride.

627
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:04,590
Oh, man.

628
00:40:05,592 --> 00:40:06,724
Aw yee...

629
00:40:21,775 --> 00:40:23,107
Dr. Andrews.

630
00:40:25,179 --> 00:40:26,360
Here's your check.

631
00:40:27,635 --> 00:40:30,969
And this is what happens
when you poach my employees.

632
00:40:45,764 --> 00:40:48,276
This is so good,
especially after a day like today.

633
00:40:51,103 --> 00:40:53,721
- To our differences.
- Mm.

634
00:40:56,242 --> 00:40:58,809
Mm. If you'll excuse me.

635
00:40:58,878 --> 00:41:01,062
Time to exercise
my reproductive freedom.

636
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,319
I'm doing my third round of IVF.

637
00:41:03,355 --> 00:41:05,411
You're gonna go jab yourself in the
belly alone

638
00:41:05,435 --> 00:41:06,692
in the hospital bathroom?

639
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,320
Gimme.

640
00:41:11,789 --> 00:41:13,957
- I am a doctor.
- Mm.

641
00:41:15,828 --> 00:41:16,828
Have at it.

642
00:41:22,734 --> 00:41:25,294
To reuniting with old friends.

643
00:41:28,673 --> 00:41:31,759
And a mommy mocktail

644
00:41:32,344 --> 00:41:33,576
with fresh rosemary.

645
00:41:33,611 --> 00:41:34,810
Yum.

646
00:41:34,846 --> 00:41:36,847
Love having bougie Kalu back.

647
00:41:38,182 --> 00:41:39,314
To Jared...

648
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:40,582
Mm.

649
00:41:40,617 --> 00:41:43,352
...fulfilling his potential

650
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,487
as my new first-year resident.

651
00:41:53,597 --> 00:41:55,116
Oh, it's probably Glassy.

652
00:41:59,836 --> 00:42:00,813
You Dr. Shaun Murphy?

653
00:42:00,837 --> 00:42:02,204
Yes.

654
00:42:02,273 --> 00:42:03,638
I am an attending surgeon

655
00:42:03,673 --> 00:42:05,793
at San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital.

656
00:42:07,104 --> 00:42:08,396
You've just been served.

657
00:42:09,886 --> 00:42:11,379
You're being sued for malpractice.

658
00:42:20,323 --> 00:42:23,060
It wasn't Dr. Glassman.
