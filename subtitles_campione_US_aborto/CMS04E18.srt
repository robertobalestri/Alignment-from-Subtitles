1
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:04,547
- Morning.
- I don't know...

2
00:00:04,572 --> 00:00:05,843
- Hey!
- Hi, Dad.

3
00:00:05,868 --> 00:00:07,591
Oh, sorry, Mom. I've got to go.

4
00:00:07,616 --> 00:00:09,241
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What'd I do?

5
00:00:09,266 --> 00:00:10,702
Nothing.
You are perfect.

6
00:00:10,727 --> 00:00:13,247
- Bye, honey.
- Bye. See you this evening.

7
00:00:13,746 --> 00:00:15,502
- How are you feeling?
- Fantastic.

8
00:00:15,527 --> 00:00:18,096
They're giving me the
steroids in the infusion.

9
00:00:18,121 --> 00:00:20,088
So I feel like I could run a marathon.

10
00:00:20,957 --> 00:00:22,136
Look what I found.

11
00:00:22,161 --> 00:00:24,605
Hmm?

12
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,062
Remember that trip we took
to Mackinac Island

13
00:00:26,086 --> 00:00:27,545
when Robin was three?

14
00:00:27,935 --> 00:00:30,100
No cars, nothing but horses.

15
00:00:30,671 --> 00:00:32,891
I remember
that "Rainbow Brite" t-shirt.

16
00:00:33,007 --> 00:00:35,258
Nothing but saltwater taffy
and ice cream.

17
00:00:35,283 --> 00:00:37,851
What a trip. That was a great trip.

18
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:41,740
No, it wasn't, Danny.
You were horribly depressed.

19
00:00:42,363 --> 00:00:45,055
You stayed in the hotel
room, laid in the bed,

20
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,473
and stared at the ceiling.

21
00:00:46,745 --> 00:00:48,583
I kept telling Robin that
you wouldn't come down,

22
00:00:48,607 --> 00:00:51,002
because Daddy didn't feel good.

23
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:52,950
- Hmm.
- Wow.

24
00:00:52,975 --> 00:00:57,894
I mean, I remember maybe
a couple of dark days.

25
00:00:57,919 --> 00:01:00,581
But, um, on the whole, uh,
didn't... didn't we have...

26
00:01:00,606 --> 00:01:02,975
Danny, what are you doing?

27
00:01:03,768 --> 00:01:06,312
I just thought you'd like
seeing these pictures.

28
00:01:06,741 --> 00:01:08,567
That's all, you know.

29
00:01:08,762 --> 00:01:11,435
I know you were trying
to rewrite history

30
00:01:12,392 --> 00:01:13,881
to paint a pretty picture

31
00:01:13,906 --> 00:01:16,988
of a happy marriage and it
wasn't always like that.

32
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:20,579
It's pure fantasy, Danny.

33
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:26,253
I know Med is not
a for-profit organization...

34
00:01:26,278 --> 00:01:28,215
But this report?

35
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:29,959
If my board saw numbers like this,

36
00:01:29,984 --> 00:01:32,205
they'd be calling for a
vote of no confidence.

37
00:01:32,995 --> 00:01:36,049
Mr. Rhodes, you can see
that one reason

38
00:01:36,074 --> 00:01:39,335
for our fiscal issues is
the E.D.'s Hybrid Room

39
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,190
which you only partially funded.

40
00:01:44,998 --> 00:01:46,885
I think the rest of the
Board would agree with me

41
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:49,711
that my contributions have
been more than generous.

42
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:53,547
No, in fact, what I'm seeing
is a lot of your pet projects

43
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:55,290
not working out so well.

44
00:01:55,493 --> 00:01:59,301
Let's look at the refurbishment
of the VIP wing.

45
00:01:59,432 --> 00:02:01,381
A lot of empty beds there.

46
00:02:01,606 --> 00:02:03,037
After Dr. Downey's death,

47
00:02:03,062 --> 00:02:05,969
we became less of a... a... a
destination hospital

48
00:02:05,994 --> 00:02:07,517
for our CT patients.

49
00:02:07,576 --> 00:02:09,808
We're still in the
process of re-branding.

50
00:02:10,775 --> 00:02:14,258
But in the meantime, since you
were such a vocal advocate

51
00:02:14,283 --> 00:02:16,748
of the Hybrid O.R., Sharon,

52
00:02:16,773 --> 00:02:19,579
it seems only fair that
you should find cuts

53
00:02:19,604 --> 00:02:23,650
in other departments to make
up for some of our losses.

54
00:02:23,882 --> 00:02:26,537
Well, I will certainly
take a look.

55
00:02:26,706 --> 00:02:29,926
But I'd hate to put us in legal jeopardy

56
00:02:29,951 --> 00:02:31,251
or lose our reputation

57
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:34,950
as the premier medical
center of the Midwest.

58
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:38,259
Well said, Sharon.
Very, very well said.

59
00:02:38,447 --> 00:02:40,930
We certainly would not want that.

60
00:02:43,242 --> 00:02:44,939
Mom, seriously, I'm fine.

61
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:46,002
That's not what
you said this morning.

62
00:02:46,026 --> 00:02:47,306
You could hardly get out of bed.

63
00:02:47,723 --> 00:02:50,274
Jenny Simpson, 17.
Abdominal pain.

64
00:02:50,299 --> 00:02:52,321
Hi. I'm Dr. Manning.
This is Dr. Choi.

65
00:02:52,346 --> 00:02:53,080
Hi.

66
00:02:53,105 --> 00:02:53,963
Mom and dad?

67
00:02:53,988 --> 00:02:56,174
Uh, E... Evie.
That's my husband, Joel.

68
00:02:56,282 --> 00:02:57,346
Hi.

69
00:02:57,559 --> 00:02:59,300
This is so unnecessary.

70
00:02:59,325 --> 00:03:01,591
It... it was probably that sketchy
salad I had last night.

71
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:03,496
Remember I said it smelled weird?

72
00:03:03,621 --> 00:03:06,713
Jenny's been in pain since we
left Fort Wayne three days ago.

73
00:03:06,738 --> 00:03:08,267
Hoosiers, huh?
Winter getaway?

74
00:03:08,292 --> 00:03:11,053
College tour.
Jenny got into Northwestern.

75
00:03:11,078 --> 00:03:12,577
Perfect SATs.

76
00:03:12,806 --> 00:03:14,847
Wow, congratulations.

77
00:03:14,872 --> 00:03:16,830
Jenny, are you feeling any nausea?

78
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,970
I mean, a little
but I'm better now.

79
00:03:20,149 --> 00:03:21,946
I don't know why you
guys are freaking...

80
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:23,635
Oh, honey.

81
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,428
We thought maybe appendicitis.

82
00:03:25,453 --> 00:03:27,018
No rebound tenderness.

83
00:03:27,043 --> 00:03:29,746
BP 100/62.
Heart rate 103.

84
00:03:29,786 --> 00:03:31,683
I told you it... it's just
food poisoning.

85
00:03:31,787 --> 00:03:33,661
All right, well, I'd still
like to do a quick ultrasound

86
00:03:33,685 --> 00:03:36,089
just to see if I can get a
visual on the appendix, okay?

87
00:03:36,114 --> 00:03:37,575
- An ultrasound?
- Mm-hmm.

88
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,052
- It'll just take a second.
- No, I... I don't want that.

89
00:03:40,077 --> 00:03:41,964
- Honey.
- I want to go.

90
00:03:42,124 --> 00:03:44,301
Jenny, appendicitis is serious,

91
00:03:44,326 --> 00:03:47,187
but it's easily treatable
if we catch it early.

92
00:03:47,723 --> 00:03:49,960
But I have to take a
look to do that, okay?

93
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:53,845
Jenny.

94
00:03:55,773 --> 00:03:58,486
Okay.
I guess.

95
00:03:59,066 --> 00:04:00,216
Great.

96
00:04:09,642 --> 00:04:11,889
Well, good news is, it
doesn't look like appendicitis.

97
00:04:11,914 --> 00:04:13,858
So what is it?

98
00:04:13,882 --> 00:04:15,840
Well, it's hard to tell just yet.

99
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:17,390
But I would like to run some tests

100
00:04:17,415 --> 00:04:19,804
just to rule a few things
out if that's all right.

101
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:21,680
- Oh, of course.
- Yeah, absolutely.

102
00:04:21,705 --> 00:04:24,953
Monique, CBC, BMP, coags
and a quant hCG.

103
00:04:24,978 --> 00:04:25,767
Mm-hmm.

104
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:26,829
We'll be back to check in

105
00:04:26,854 --> 00:04:28,396
once we get the test results in.

106
00:04:28,421 --> 00:04:29,649
Thank you.

107
00:04:32,204 --> 00:04:33,356
Did you see how scared she got

108
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,925
when I mentioned the ultrasound?

109
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,402
Yeah, she was pretty defensive.

110
00:04:36,427 --> 00:04:38,489
- You thinking what I'm thinking?
- Pregnancy?

111
00:04:38,514 --> 00:04:40,716
Thinking an endometrium,
but I didn't see an embryo.

112
00:04:40,741 --> 00:04:43,240
Well, she could've had
a miscarriage or an abortion.

113
00:04:43,265 --> 00:04:44,084
But whatever it is,

114
00:04:44,109 --> 00:04:46,419
she is definitely trying to
keep her parents in the dark.

115
00:04:46,444 --> 00:04:48,485
Yeah, but I don't think
that's going to be possible.

116
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:07,667
- Heads up, Maggie.

117
00:05:07,692 --> 00:05:10,551
There's probably going to be
more spending cuts coming down.

118
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:11,407
More?

119
00:05:11,432 --> 00:05:14,343
Gwen hasn't met her goals
and she's feeling the heat.

120
00:05:14,582 --> 00:05:15,822
We're already short-staffed.

121
00:05:15,847 --> 00:05:17,631
We're using those cheapo
central line kits.

122
00:05:17,656 --> 00:05:18,961
What more does Gwen want?

123
00:05:19,091 --> 00:05:21,268
- Oh, speak of the devil.
- Oh.

124
00:05:21,297 --> 00:05:24,847
She's got a big fish
coming into the VIP wing.

125
00:05:24,872 --> 00:05:26,658
Ooh!

126
00:05:29,445 --> 00:05:30,906
Wow!

127
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:32,613
Oh, man, I love it.

128
00:05:32,638 --> 00:05:33,803
Thanks.

129
00:05:34,026 --> 00:05:36,159
It's a lot easier to manage.

130
00:05:39,142 --> 00:05:40,415
Hey.

131
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,862
New hairdo?

132
00:05:41,887 --> 00:05:43,253
Hey.

133
00:05:43,651 --> 00:05:45,174
It looks good.

134
00:05:46,676 --> 00:05:49,331
Uh, so we still on? Drinks for tonight?

135
00:05:52,422 --> 00:05:55,438
Um, I'm sorry.

136
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,438
I can't. Something came up.

137
00:05:59,309 --> 00:06:00,981
Something?

138
00:06:01,276 --> 00:06:02,862
Yeah.

139
00:06:03,105 --> 00:06:05,107
Um, tomorrow then?

140
00:06:06,678 --> 00:06:09,091
Uh, that's not going
to work either.

141
00:06:10,177 --> 00:06:11,744
This weekend?

142
00:06:12,491 --> 00:06:14,375
Can I let you know?

143
00:06:15,196 --> 00:06:17,655
Yeah.
No big deal.

144
00:06:22,021 --> 00:06:24,346
New hairdo?

145
00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:27,225
Women don't do that for no reason.

146
00:06:27,657 --> 00:06:28,875
I'm guessing there's a guy.

147
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,855
You're suddenly an expert
on women.

148
00:06:31,451 --> 00:06:32,772
Too bad, Choi.

149
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,395
I'll be using what's
called the "David Procedure"

150
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,710
to resect your aneurysm.

151
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:43,244
It will allow us to
preserve your native valve.

152
00:06:43,563 --> 00:06:45,217
Our Chief of CT, Dr. Latham,

153
00:06:45,242 --> 00:06:47,501
is going to be assisting
me on the operation.

154
00:06:47,943 --> 00:06:51,547
Uh, do you have any questions, concerns?

155
00:06:51,638 --> 00:06:54,592
No concerns.
My people did their research.

156
00:06:54,894 --> 00:06:56,462
You were at the top of the list,

157
00:06:56,487 --> 00:06:58,485
just under the late Dr. Downey.

158
00:06:58,882 --> 00:07:01,684
Dr. Rhodes was
Dr. Downey's star protégé.

159
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:02,822
I'm aware.

160
00:07:03,315 --> 00:07:05,260
I wanted to let you know,
Mr. Montero,

161
00:07:05,285 --> 00:07:08,418
that as you recuperate, we can
offer you spa-like amenities.

162
00:07:08,443 --> 00:07:10,278
Massage, facials.

163
00:07:10,303 --> 00:07:12,698
With your doctor's
permission, of course.

164
00:07:14,299 --> 00:07:17,186
We also have a concierge
at your disposal.

165
00:07:17,453 --> 00:07:20,671
Here is a list of all
our personal services

166
00:07:20,703 --> 00:07:22,484
and our menu options.

167
00:07:25,841 --> 00:07:27,717
You can almost forget
you're in the hospital.

168
00:07:40,489 --> 00:07:43,286
Why is Dr. Rhodes scheduled
to operate on Mr. Montero?

169
00:07:43,311 --> 00:07:44,661
It's out of my hands.

170
00:07:44,686 --> 00:07:46,434
Dr. Rhodes is
on the trauma service.

171
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:47,435
I'm the attending in CT.

172
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,616
Mr. Montero's case should've come to me.

173
00:07:49,881 --> 00:07:50,908
Dr. Bekker,

174
00:07:50,933 --> 00:07:55,041
Mr. Montero specifically
requested Dr. Rhodes

175
00:07:55,301 --> 00:07:58,088
and Mr. Montero gets what he wants.

176
00:08:04,426 --> 00:08:06,306
Jenny Simpson's test results.

177
00:08:07,668 --> 00:08:09,511
What's going on with you and Phillip?

178
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:11,604
Are you seeing him?

179
00:08:12,018 --> 00:08:14,456
You know, like, seeing him, seeing him?

180
00:08:14,481 --> 00:08:15,943
Mm-hmm.

181
00:08:16,239 --> 00:08:19,114
I thought it
was headed that way.

182
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,450
He is a lovely guy, Maggie.

183
00:08:24,094 --> 00:08:25,789
But so is Big Red.

184
00:08:31,475 --> 00:08:34,145
It is way more complicated
than that and you know it.

185
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,307
Ethan.

186
00:08:44,686 --> 00:08:46,837
Jenny, where are your parents?

187
00:08:46,862 --> 00:08:48,477
They went to get coffee.

188
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:52,447
We have to ask you something.

189
00:08:52,854 --> 00:08:54,654
Jenny, we got your blood work back

190
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:56,494
and it indicates pregnancy.

191
00:08:56,801 --> 00:08:58,368
No, I'm not pregnant.

192
00:08:58,598 --> 00:09:00,909
- Let us explain.
- I'm not pregnant.

193
00:09:01,557 --> 00:09:03,711
We understand how hard this is.

194
00:09:03,736 --> 00:09:06,558
But your test results and your symptoms

195
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,927
shows that maybe you
had a miscarriage or...

196
00:09:08,952 --> 00:09:12,097
No. No, I didn't.
I don't want to talk about it.

197
00:09:12,464 --> 00:09:16,272
Jenny, in order for us
to treat you properly,

198
00:09:16,297 --> 00:09:18,212
we really need to know what happened.

199
00:09:18,327 --> 00:09:21,211
Please, we are not here
to judge you.

200
00:09:21,236 --> 00:09:23,276
- No.
- We want to help you.

201
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:27,031
The whole thing was stupid.

202
00:09:27,772 --> 00:09:29,744
So stupid.

203
00:09:31,201 --> 00:09:32,769
When I found out that I was pregnant,

204
00:09:32,794 --> 00:09:34,541
I didn't know what to do.

205
00:09:35,457 --> 00:09:38,048
I'm finishing high school
and I'm going to college.

206
00:09:38,073 --> 00:09:39,421
I understand.

207
00:09:39,825 --> 00:09:42,964
So I went online and... and
I read about these pills.

208
00:09:42,989 --> 00:09:44,350
And what were they?

209
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,419
Mife-something.

210
00:09:45,444 --> 00:09:46,663
Mifepristone?

211
00:09:46,688 --> 00:09:49,183
Did you take the follow
up pill Misoprostol?

212
00:09:50,395 --> 00:09:53,164
I couldn't get it.
Not without a doctor.

213
00:09:53,189 --> 00:09:55,844
Jenny, that's why
you're in so much pain.

214
00:09:56,078 --> 00:09:58,695
Without the second pill, you
haven't fully aborted yet.

215
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,489
Help me.

216
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,367
Please.

217
00:10:02,415 --> 00:10:04,244
Just don't tell my parents.

218
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:06,651
They'll hate me and
they'll never forgive me.

219
00:10:06,676 --> 00:10:07,535
Please.

220
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,372
I think you might be
underestimating them.

221
00:10:09,397 --> 00:10:12,216
No, I know them
and you can't tell them.

222
00:10:12,241 --> 00:10:12,928
Jenny, I'm sorry...

223
00:10:12,953 --> 00:10:14,520
We're not going to tell
your parents

224
00:10:14,636 --> 00:10:16,594
but I am going to give
you the second pill

225
00:10:17,007 --> 00:10:19,879
so that you can expel whatever
is left in your uterus, okay?

226
00:10:20,067 --> 00:10:22,434
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

227
00:10:26,149 --> 00:10:28,013
Nat, she's a minor.

228
00:10:28,038 --> 00:10:30,236
We can't give her medications
without her parents' consent.

229
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,103
Yes, we can.

230
00:10:31,128 --> 00:10:32,486
Uh, Dr. Manning?

231
00:10:33,073 --> 00:10:35,076
Have you found out what's
wrong with our daughter?

232
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,234
Uh, we were actually
just discussing that.

233
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:39,916
Unfortunately we're still
waiting on some test results.

234
00:10:39,941 --> 00:10:42,791
The best thing you can do
right now is just be patient.

235
00:10:43,215 --> 00:10:44,722
Wait... wait, that's it?

236
00:10:44,747 --> 00:10:45,838
You have no idea?

237
00:10:45,863 --> 00:10:47,955
I know how frustrating
this must be

238
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,844
but I promise you, we are doing
everything possible for Jenny.

239
00:10:51,398 --> 00:10:52,929
I'm sure that you are.

240
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:54,821
Come on, hon.

241
00:10:58,963 --> 00:11:00,442
What do you think you're doing?

242
00:11:00,467 --> 00:11:02,150
I'm honoring my patient's wishes.

243
00:11:02,182 --> 00:11:04,096
- And lying to her parents?
- I did not lie to them.

244
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,780
You withheld the truth, Nat.

245
00:11:05,805 --> 00:11:07,729
They have a right to know.
A legal right.

246
00:11:07,754 --> 00:11:08,974
That's Jenny's call.

247
00:11:08,999 --> 00:11:11,536
If you have a problem with
it, take it up with Goodwin.

248
00:11:13,331 --> 00:11:15,453
Dr. Lanik, FBI medics
have landed.

249
00:11:15,478 --> 00:11:16,747
April, you're up.

250
00:11:16,828 --> 00:11:18,091
FBI?

251
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,334
Special Agent Sam Pearson.

252
00:11:20,359 --> 00:11:22,174
Low speed motor vehicle collision.

253
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:25,749
GCS 10, LOC on site,
nasal airway in place.

254
00:11:26,345 --> 00:11:27,782
Hey, I know this guy.
Let me work him up.

255
00:11:27,806 --> 00:11:29,767
Self-starter.
Who am I to interfere?

256
00:11:31,795 --> 00:11:33,562
Okay, on my count.

257
00:11:33,587 --> 00:11:34,899
One, two, three.

258
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,444
Hang in there, Sam. I got you.

259
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,237
- What's the story?
- Air bags deployed,

260
00:11:40,262 --> 00:11:41,862
but his chest caught most of the impact.

261
00:11:45,369 --> 00:11:46,779
He's not protecting
his airway, got to intubate.

262
00:11:46,803 --> 00:11:49,667
20 of etomidate, 100 of sux.
Get an x-ray in here.

263
00:11:54,952 --> 00:11:56,634
Meds are in.

264
00:11:58,035 --> 00:12:02,127
Heart rate 124, BP 132/88,
sats 95.

265
00:12:02,296 --> 00:12:03,681
I'm in.
Bag him.

266
00:12:11,234 --> 00:12:13,659
Good breath sounds bilaterally.
Let's get that chest X-ray.

267
00:12:13,684 --> 00:12:14,933
Yes, Doctor.

268
00:12:18,531 --> 00:12:19,872
Clear.

269
00:12:20,527 --> 00:12:22,183
Chest shows multiple rib fractures

270
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,428
and bilateral pulmonary contusions.

271
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:26,787
I need a CBC, CMP, blood gas, and coags.

272
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:28,597
I'm seeing PVCs on the monitor.

273
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:30,258
Got it.

274
00:12:32,443 --> 00:12:34,097
Is he going to be okay?

275
00:12:34,885 --> 00:12:36,143
Ingrid.

276
00:12:36,876 --> 00:12:38,767
He's in rough shape, but stable for now.

277
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:39,978
Were you with him?

278
00:12:40,003 --> 00:12:41,148
Yeah.

279
00:12:41,695 --> 00:12:43,666
- Let me check you out.
- No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

280
00:12:43,691 --> 00:12:47,030
Just... just keep my partner alive.

281
00:12:56,172 --> 00:12:58,436
Dr. Manning boxed us
into this situation.

282
00:12:58,461 --> 00:13:00,222
You want to talk about boxed in?

283
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:01,756
The only reason we're in this situation

284
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,504
is because Jenny had no options.

285
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:05,138
The family lives in Indiana.

286
00:13:05,163 --> 00:13:07,006
Where she would need
parental consent.

287
00:13:07,031 --> 00:13:08,554
And she was afraid
to talk to them,

288
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:09,917
so there was nowhere else to go

289
00:13:09,942 --> 00:13:11,757
so she went online to find medication.

290
00:13:11,782 --> 00:13:13,661
This generation's back alley abortion.

291
00:13:13,686 --> 00:13:15,517
We don't make the laws
but we have to obey them.

292
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:17,760
Jenny's a minor and that means
we have to tell her parents

293
00:13:17,784 --> 00:13:18,478
before we treat.

294
00:13:18,503 --> 00:13:20,874
No, her pregnancy test
is still positive.

295
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:23,213
Therefore, under the
law, she is emancipated.

296
00:13:23,238 --> 00:13:24,745
She was pregnant.
Not anymore.

297
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,300
Uh, technically she still is.

298
00:13:26,325 --> 00:13:27,285
Ms. Goodwin.

299
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:29,287
I'll admit it's a thin argument.

300
00:13:29,493 --> 00:13:32,453
Emancipation covers a woman's decisions

301
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,177
regarding her pregnancy,

302
00:13:34,202 --> 00:13:35,956
but, uh, my understanding

303
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:40,135
is that Ms. Simpson has
already made her choice.

304
00:13:40,355 --> 00:13:42,097
So we betray this girl's trust?

305
00:13:42,122 --> 00:13:44,180
Well, that's not what
I'm suggesting.

306
00:13:44,205 --> 00:13:46,518
We have to obey the law
and tell her parents.

307
00:13:46,543 --> 00:13:48,281
Oh, that's not
exactly right either.

308
00:13:48,306 --> 00:13:51,180
If we had provided a medical abortion,

309
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,191
which we didn't, then yes.

310
00:13:53,216 --> 00:13:54,610
The state of Illinois says

311
00:13:54,635 --> 00:13:56,914
we're obligated to inform the parents.

312
00:13:56,939 --> 00:14:00,944
But since she obtained
the medication herself

313
00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:04,373
out-of state, I'm not so sure.

314
00:14:05,376 --> 00:14:07,727
So you intend to keep
the parents in the dark

315
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:08,769
based on a technicality?

316
00:14:08,794 --> 00:14:11,449
No, because our patient asked
us to keep it confidential.

317
00:14:11,474 --> 00:14:14,593
Look, I would suggest
you continue to treat her

318
00:14:14,618 --> 00:14:16,377
according to her wishes

319
00:14:16,402 --> 00:14:19,559
until our lawyers make a determination.

320
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,311
Thank you, Ms. Goodwin.

321
00:14:30,512 --> 00:14:32,032
Why are you here?

322
00:14:33,111 --> 00:14:34,860
I'm scrubbing in on your surgery.

323
00:14:34,885 --> 00:14:36,996
No, Dr. Latham is assisting.

324
00:14:37,021 --> 00:14:38,334
He reconsidered.

325
00:14:38,359 --> 00:14:39,988
So just like that, he pulled out.

326
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:42,014
- What did you say to him?
- Really, Connor?

327
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:43,438
Why wasn't I consulted?

328
00:14:43,463 --> 00:14:44,833
Don't worry.
It's been made very clear to me

329
00:14:44,857 --> 00:14:46,336
that Mr. Montero is your patient.

330
00:14:46,361 --> 00:14:48,036
I'm only here as your humble assistant.

331
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:51,681
By the way, I had my last HIV test.

332
00:14:51,706 --> 00:14:53,142
I'm clear.

333
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:55,845
I'm glad to hear it.

334
00:14:55,877 --> 00:14:57,586
Since you were the one who
so carelessly cut me,

335
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:58,959
I thought you might be.

336
00:15:08,479 --> 00:15:10,037
How is she?

337
00:15:10,499 --> 00:15:12,875
Cuts and scrapes.
Nothing serious.

338
00:15:18,221 --> 00:15:19,483
Ingrid.

339
00:15:19,508 --> 00:15:20,718
How's Sam?

340
00:15:21,665 --> 00:15:23,638
Wait and see right now.

341
00:15:25,453 --> 00:15:27,238
Can I get you anything?

342
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,039
No.

343
00:15:32,386 --> 00:15:34,610
Haven't seen you at
the dog park lately.

344
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:37,363
It's... work.

345
00:15:41,937 --> 00:15:43,788
I'll keep you posted on Sam.

346
00:15:51,022 --> 00:15:52,371
Where are we?

347
00:15:52,396 --> 00:15:54,083
The PVCs were all unifocal,

348
00:15:54,108 --> 00:15:56,262
but his airway pressures are bad.

349
00:15:57,093 --> 00:16:00,183
PaO2's at 50
and peak pressure's at 55.

350
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:02,019
All this from a car crash?

351
00:16:02,119 --> 00:16:04,022
They said he wasn't
even going that fast.

352
00:16:04,456 --> 00:16:06,204
He shouldn't be this sick.

353
00:16:06,229 --> 00:16:08,688
Crank the O2 and
increase his PEEP to 12.

354
00:16:08,713 --> 00:16:10,404
See if we can improve his oxygenation.

355
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:11,429
Okay.

356
00:16:19,808 --> 00:16:21,113
These bruises.

357
00:16:21,138 --> 00:16:22,911
They don't look like
they're from an air bag.

358
00:16:22,936 --> 00:16:24,598
They're too extensive.

359
00:16:24,623 --> 00:16:27,008
The air bag shouldn't
have touched his legs.

360
00:16:27,248 --> 00:16:28,990
We still waiting on those CT scans?

361
00:16:29,015 --> 00:16:30,721
Radiology's been slammed
all morning.

362
00:16:30,746 --> 00:16:32,421
Get him moved up.
Don't take no for an answer.

363
00:16:32,445 --> 00:16:33,648
These injuries just don't add up.

364
00:16:33,672 --> 00:16:34,768
You got it.

365
00:16:41,693 --> 00:16:43,783
Proximal anastomosis done.

366
00:16:43,939 --> 00:16:45,158
I'm working on the distal now.

367
00:16:45,183 --> 00:16:47,241
Temp's coming up.
33 degrees.

368
00:16:47,909 --> 00:16:49,302
We need to move faster.

369
00:16:49,327 --> 00:16:50,590
Look, I realize that,

370
00:16:50,615 --> 00:16:52,530
but the graft is coming down unevenly.

371
00:16:52,555 --> 00:16:55,167
If I keep tugging, I
could tear the aorta.

372
00:16:57,268 --> 00:16:58,673
A suggestion?

373
00:16:59,736 --> 00:17:01,050
What?

374
00:17:01,456 --> 00:17:03,415
Try pulling on the
non-coronary commissure.

375
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,746
I think that'll move the
graft into proper position.

376
00:17:05,794 --> 00:17:07,267
Okay.

377
00:17:10,139 --> 00:17:11,439
That did it, thank you.

378
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:12,690
Of course.

379
00:17:12,746 --> 00:17:14,441
All right,
let's finish the anastomosis.

380
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:18,026
No, I haven't told him, but
I don't feel good about it.

381
00:17:18,051 --> 00:17:20,098
Don't you think he has a right to know?

382
00:17:20,561 --> 00:17:23,246
Uh, I've got to go.
I'll talk to you later.

383
00:17:24,786 --> 00:17:26,332
You need something?

384
00:17:27,563 --> 00:17:29,085
No.

385
00:17:29,156 --> 00:17:30,463
Okay.

386
00:17:31,534 --> 00:17:34,842
Help! Dr. Manning!
Dr. Choi!

387
00:17:36,467 --> 00:17:37,637
Oh, my God.

388
00:17:38,054 --> 00:17:39,708
- Help her!
- I feel dizzy.

389
00:17:40,022 --> 00:17:42,517
Jenny, keep looking at me.
Keep talking, okay?

390
00:17:42,542 --> 00:17:43,216
Mmm, Mom.

391
00:17:43,241 --> 00:17:44,789
You'll be okay, honey.
Mommy is right here.

392
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,835
- I don't feel good.
- Oh, God.

393
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,326
What is happening to my daughter?

394
00:17:48,351 --> 00:17:49,180
There's so much blood.

395
00:17:49,205 --> 00:17:50,446
It's a gynecologic hemorrhage.

396
00:17:50,471 --> 00:17:51,563
She's passing retained tissue...

397
00:17:51,587 --> 00:17:53,727
We need to control the bleed.

398
00:17:53,996 --> 00:17:56,216
Monique, hang a unit of typed
and crossed-matched blood,

399
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,647
give her 0.2 milligrams
of methergine IM,

400
00:17:58,672 --> 00:18:01,041
and I need a stat CBC and coags.

401
00:18:02,388 --> 00:18:04,756
Wait, we need
her parental consent.

402
00:18:04,781 --> 00:18:05,672
Ethan.

403
00:18:05,726 --> 00:18:08,719
To start the transfusion
and administer the medication.

404
00:18:08,934 --> 00:18:10,864
Yeah, wh... whatever
you need to do.

405
00:18:13,143 --> 00:18:14,753
Go ahead.

406
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,072
I may have distorted the
graft with that last stitch.

407
00:18:25,331 --> 00:18:27,724
I'm doing this backhand. Do
you have a better angle?

408
00:18:27,749 --> 00:18:29,360
I think so.

409
00:18:35,476 --> 00:18:36,898
Dr. Rhodes's phone.

410
00:18:36,923 --> 00:18:38,130
Take a message.

411
00:18:38,155 --> 00:18:39,086
All right, last couple of stitches

412
00:18:39,111 --> 00:18:40,634
then we're coming off pump.

413
00:18:40,659 --> 00:18:43,572
- Dr. Rhodes?
- I said take a message.

414
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:46,097
Dr. Rhodes, he says
it's an emergency.

415
00:18:47,087 --> 00:18:48,434
All right.

416
00:18:50,486 --> 00:18:52,648
Look, I'm in the middle of an operation.

417
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:54,776
What?

418
00:18:55,299 --> 00:18:57,307
Is this some kind of joke?

419
00:18:58,361 --> 00:19:00,156
How do I know that?

420
00:19:02,034 --> 00:19:04,819
All right. All right, all right.

421
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:06,415
What... what do you want me to do?

422
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,834
What is it?

423
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:10,021
Okay, yeah, okay.

424
00:19:10,046 --> 00:19:12,266
Yeah, look.

425
00:19:12,344 --> 00:19:14,559
No, I won't hang up. I promise.

426
00:19:16,706 --> 00:19:18,104
- I have to leave.
- What?

427
00:19:18,129 --> 00:19:20,056
Finish the anastomosis.

428
00:19:20,081 --> 00:19:21,599
Check the competency of the valve.

429
00:19:21,624 --> 00:19:22,561
Connor, no!

430
00:19:22,586 --> 00:19:24,312
You've done this before.
You'll be fine.

431
00:19:24,337 --> 00:19:25,605
- That's not...
- No!

432
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,733
I'm not... I'm not hanging up.
I promise.

433
00:19:27,902 --> 00:19:29,427
All right, we have
a patient on the table.

434
00:19:29,451 --> 00:19:30,845
Let's get back to work.

435
00:19:32,322 --> 00:19:33,740
I just left the operating room.

436
00:19:33,765 --> 00:19:34,647
I'm headed out now.

437
00:19:34,672 --> 00:19:35,994
You finished already,
Dr. Rhodes?

438
00:19:36,019 --> 00:19:37,871
No, I'm still here.
Okay, I won't hang up.

439
00:19:37,896 --> 00:19:39,072
Dr. Rhodes?

440
00:19:49,952 --> 00:19:51,604
No, I'm still here. I'm still here.

441
00:19:51,629 --> 00:19:53,874
The elevator is really slow.

442
00:19:55,504 --> 00:19:58,333
Look, I'm moving as fast
as I can, man, I promise.

443
00:19:58,556 --> 00:20:00,301
_

444
00:20:00,811 --> 00:20:02,483
Can I talk to her?

445
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,112
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

446
00:20:06,657 --> 00:20:08,283
I'll do whatever you say.

447
00:20:09,783 --> 00:20:11,495
All right, I'm leaving now.

448
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,524
Just please, don't hurt her.

449
00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:14,508
Robin, it's Dad.

450
00:20:14,533 --> 00:20:16,667
Can you, um, can you call
me as soon as you get this?

451
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:19,672
My bank is on the corner
of LaSalle and Van Buren.

452
00:20:19,697 --> 00:20:21,090
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

453
00:20:23,252 --> 00:20:30,101
_

454
00:20:36,747 --> 00:20:39,321
Trudy, it's Dan Charles.

455
00:20:39,346 --> 00:20:42,158
I-I need to speak to
Hank Voight immediately.

456
00:20:51,671 --> 00:20:53,630
What the hell is going on
with Dr. Rhodes?

457
00:20:53,674 --> 00:20:54,763
What do you mean?

458
00:20:54,788 --> 00:20:56,370
Halfway through Mr. Montero's surgery,

459
00:20:56,395 --> 00:20:58,568
he left the O.R. and the hospital.

460
00:20:58,593 --> 00:20:59,511
What?

461
00:20:59,536 --> 00:21:01,746
You know how important
this patient is to us

462
00:21:01,771 --> 00:21:03,766
and if his outcome is less than perfect,

463
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,409
I will fire Dr. Rhodes

464
00:21:05,434 --> 00:21:07,312
and that'll be the
least of his problems.

465
00:21:07,513 --> 00:21:10,316
I'll sue him and then I'll
bring him up on charges.

466
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,711
I know there is a reasonable
explanation for this.

467
00:21:13,736 --> 00:21:15,239
If this blows up, Sharon,

468
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,847
he won't be the only one without a job.

469
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:28,046
I'm heading east on Lake.

470
00:21:28,071 --> 00:21:30,379
You're late... you said you'd
be there in 20 minutes.

471
00:21:30,404 --> 00:21:31,840
I can't help the traffic.

472
00:21:31,908 --> 00:21:33,470
Are you playing games with me?

473
00:21:33,495 --> 00:21:35,509
I am doing the best I can!

474
00:21:35,845 --> 00:21:38,289
Whatever happens to Robin,
that's on you, man!

475
00:21:38,314 --> 00:21:40,561
Just... just don't touch her!

476
00:21:44,267 --> 00:21:46,153
Move! Move!

477
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,641
Since your patient,
Jenny Simpson, is a minor,

478
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:06,134
legal is concerned about liability.

479
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,466
Of course they are.

480
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:09,502
Bottom line, if you feel the need

481
00:22:09,527 --> 00:22:11,401
for any further medical procedures,

482
00:22:11,426 --> 00:22:13,603
you must obtain parental consent.

483
00:22:13,628 --> 00:22:15,439
Good, thank you.

484
00:22:18,154 --> 00:22:19,721
This isn't right.

485
00:22:19,746 --> 00:22:23,159
I'm sorry, Dr. Manning, but
you've given her Methergine.

486
00:22:23,184 --> 00:22:23,918
- Yes?
- Yes.

487
00:22:23,951 --> 00:22:26,635
So let's hope she passes
any retained tissue

488
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,955
and that should take care of it.

489
00:22:31,979 --> 00:22:33,482
Hi.

490
00:22:33,507 --> 00:22:35,585
Could we have a moment to examine Jenny?

491
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:36,358
Oh, of course.

492
00:22:36,383 --> 00:22:38,022
When are we going
to know something?

493
00:22:38,047 --> 00:22:40,587
Honey, let them do their job.

494
00:22:40,778 --> 00:22:42,179
Come on.

495
00:22:42,629 --> 00:22:44,182
Thank you.

496
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,692
How are you feeling, Jenny?

497
00:22:47,717 --> 00:22:48,856
Not good?

498
00:22:48,881 --> 00:22:51,111
Well, I'm going to do
an internal exam, okay?

499
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,831
So I just need you to lift
up your legs just like that

500
00:22:53,856 --> 00:22:55,741
and then just let them fall open.

501
00:22:55,766 --> 00:22:57,870
Perfect. Um, and I apologize.

502
00:22:57,895 --> 00:23:00,427
This is going to be a
little uncomfortable, okay?

503
00:23:00,452 --> 00:23:01,621
Thank you.

504
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:03,539
All right, you ready?

505
00:23:07,103 --> 00:23:08,671
You okay?

506
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,512
What is it?

507
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,805
Well, your body hasn't
expelled all the tissue

508
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,548
related to the pregnancy.

509
00:23:19,573 --> 00:23:21,674
The medication we gave
you is supposed to help

510
00:23:21,699 --> 00:23:23,440
but unfortunately,
you're still bleeding.

511
00:23:23,465 --> 00:23:27,140
It means you're going to need
a D&C, dilation and curettage,

512
00:23:27,165 --> 00:23:30,030
a surgical procedure
to remove the tissue.

513
00:23:30,055 --> 00:23:32,492
But we do need your parents'
permission for this.

514
00:23:32,957 --> 00:23:35,245
N-no. You can't tell them.

515
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,388
We have to.

516
00:23:36,413 --> 00:23:38,166
Jenny, your temperature
is elevated,

517
00:23:38,191 --> 00:23:40,890
which means you could be
developing endometritis,

518
00:23:40,915 --> 00:23:42,921
which is a very serious infection.

519
00:23:43,167 --> 00:23:44,773
It could be life-threatening.

520
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,078
No. No, no!

521
00:23:47,103 --> 00:23:49,847
Jenny, I know you're afraid
of what your parents will say,

522
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:54,603
but they love you and they
would never want to lose you.

523
00:23:57,001 --> 00:23:59,193
So I'm going to go talk
to them, okay?

524
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,278
Wait.

525
00:24:04,123 --> 00:24:05,408
My mom...

526
00:24:06,453 --> 00:24:08,130
Ask my mom to come in.

527
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,561
Okay.

528
00:24:13,389 --> 00:24:15,795
Mrs. Simpson, Jenny would
like to talk to you.

529
00:24:16,026 --> 00:24:17,298
Oh.

530
00:24:17,842 --> 00:24:21,428
Um, hey, why don't you, uh,
go get a cup of coffee?

531
00:24:21,567 --> 00:24:24,599
I-I think this is mother-daughter talk.

532
00:24:25,008 --> 00:24:26,977
No, it'll be okay.

533
00:24:36,121 --> 00:24:38,167
Agent Pearson's CT results.

534
00:24:44,694 --> 00:24:46,334
Is something wrong?

535
00:24:50,938 --> 00:24:52,633
Sam's CAT scan.

536
00:24:53,652 --> 00:24:55,871
Bilateral diffuse pulmonary white out,

537
00:24:55,896 --> 00:24:58,473
bilateral subclinical pneumothoraces,

538
00:24:58,566 --> 00:25:00,903
sternal fracture, subcapsular
liver hematoma...

539
00:25:00,936 --> 00:25:02,270
What does all that mean?

540
00:25:02,627 --> 00:25:04,523
Looks like blast lung.

541
00:25:05,236 --> 00:25:07,820
These injuries were not
caused by a car crash.

542
00:25:07,845 --> 00:25:09,904
Ingrid, what really happened?

543
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,325
Tell me.

544
00:25:14,168 --> 00:25:15,788
Will it affect how you treat him?

545
00:25:15,813 --> 00:25:17,414
Of course it will!

546
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:21,837
- What happened?
- Okay.

547
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:26,285
We... there was an explosion and
Sam took the brunt of it.

548
00:25:26,448 --> 00:25:28,200
What kind of explosion?

549
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:29,451
A meth lab.

550
00:25:29,476 --> 00:25:31,306
What are we talking about then?

551
00:25:31,416 --> 00:25:34,393
Acetone peroxide? Red phosphorus?

552
00:25:34,418 --> 00:25:35,770
Yes.

553
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:38,148
What else can you tell us?

554
00:25:40,737 --> 00:25:41,825
Ingrid!

555
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:43,530
God's sakes, Will,
isn't that enough?

556
00:25:45,155 --> 00:25:47,048
Convert him to lung
protective ventilation.

557
00:25:47,073 --> 00:25:50,456
Drop the tidal volume to 4 cc's
per kilo and up his rate to 28.

558
00:25:50,481 --> 00:25:51,999
On it.

559
00:26:04,662 --> 00:26:06,688
You.
I knew it.

560
00:26:06,934 --> 00:26:08,981
I knew it all along.

561
00:26:09,006 --> 00:26:11,470
You had no right to keep this from us.

562
00:26:11,495 --> 00:26:12,901
It was Jenny's wish.

563
00:26:12,926 --> 00:26:15,581
Well, of course she didn't
want us to find out.

564
00:26:15,665 --> 00:26:17,280
She knew it was wrong.

565
00:26:17,726 --> 00:26:20,911
What she did was... was murder.

566
00:26:21,686 --> 00:26:23,120
Mrs. Simpson, um,

567
00:26:23,145 --> 00:26:26,000
you should know that Jenny
didn't want to tell you

568
00:26:26,025 --> 00:26:28,210
because she was afraid you
wouldn't love her anymore.

569
00:26:29,903 --> 00:26:31,174
No...

570
00:26:33,244 --> 00:26:34,718
No.

571
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:36,241
No, no, no.

572
00:26:36,266 --> 00:26:38,723
Listen, no matter what
your beliefs are,

573
00:26:38,955 --> 00:26:42,228
that's your daughter
and she's very sick.

574
00:26:42,253 --> 00:26:43,480
Oh...

575
00:26:45,133 --> 00:26:47,961
Look, can I give the consent for the D&C

576
00:26:47,986 --> 00:26:49,423
without my husband?

577
00:26:49,726 --> 00:26:51,322
Yes.

578
00:26:52,846 --> 00:26:55,370
Do whatever you have to do
to save my daughter.

579
00:26:55,525 --> 00:26:57,538
Just don't tell Joel what happened.

580
00:26:57,564 --> 00:26:59,740
I don't want this to destroy my family.

581
00:27:00,091 --> 00:27:02,504
But doesn't he have
the right to know?

582
00:27:02,529 --> 00:27:03,672
He's her father.

583
00:27:05,202 --> 00:27:06,716
Actually...

584
00:27:06,747 --> 00:27:09,303
Actually, he isn't.

585
00:27:11,019 --> 00:27:13,601
And no, I never told him.

586
00:27:27,253 --> 00:27:28,536
All right, I'm here.

587
00:27:31,396 --> 00:27:33,790
Ginny, Ginny, hi. Hi.

588
00:27:33,815 --> 00:27:35,911
Hello, Dr. Rhodes,
what can I do for you?

589
00:27:35,936 --> 00:27:37,598
I need to take $50,000

590
00:27:37,623 --> 00:27:39,924
out of my money market account in cash.

591
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:40,884
Cash?

592
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:43,123
Yes and please,
I am in a bit of a hurry.

593
00:27:43,148 --> 00:27:44,694
It'll take a few minutes.

594
00:27:44,719 --> 00:27:47,288
I'm not sure the tellers
have that much on hand.

595
00:27:47,313 --> 00:27:49,445
I may need to go into the vault.

596
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,939
Ginny, whatever it takes,
just please do it. Thank you.

597
00:27:54,658 --> 00:27:56,070
All right, did you hear that?

598
00:27:56,095 --> 00:27:58,197
It's going to take awhile.

599
00:27:58,515 --> 00:28:00,519
No. No, no, no, no, no.

600
00:28:00,544 --> 00:28:02,744
I-I-I-I didn't call them. I swear!

601
00:28:03,001 --> 00:28:06,208
No, no. No, no, no. They...
They... they can't be outside!

602
00:28:06,233 --> 00:28:07,793
I didn't call them! Please! Please!

603
00:28:07,818 --> 00:28:08,903
No, no, no! Don't hang up!

604
00:28:08,928 --> 00:28:11,002
I am getting you the money!

605
00:28:11,027 --> 00:28:14,092
Hello? Hello, you there? You... hello?

606
00:28:14,779 --> 00:28:17,107
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

607
00:28:17,132 --> 00:28:18,395
No!

608
00:28:26,609 --> 00:28:28,350
No! No, no, no, no!

609
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:29,518
I told you not to call the police!

610
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:30,924
They saw you! They're going to kill her!

611
00:28:30,948 --> 00:28:32,299
- They're not.
- You don't know that.

612
00:28:32,323 --> 00:28:34,029
- Yes, I do.
- Dr. Rhodes.

613
00:28:34,054 --> 00:28:35,487
Robin was never kidnapped.

614
00:28:35,512 --> 00:28:36,971
No, she was.
I-I-I-I-I heard her.

615
00:28:36,996 --> 00:28:38,214
I heard her scream!

616
00:28:38,239 --> 00:28:40,830
- It wasn't her, buddy.
- No, it's a scam.

617
00:28:41,708 --> 00:28:43,666
Dr. Rhodes, it's a scam.

618
00:28:43,718 --> 00:28:44,894
Scam?

619
00:28:45,078 --> 00:28:46,586
When I finally reached Robin,

620
00:28:46,611 --> 00:28:48,600
she had no idea what
I was talking about.

621
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:51,935
You... you spoke to her
and she's fine?

622
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,595
Was never in any danger.

623
00:29:08,738 --> 00:29:10,648
Watch out.

624
00:29:10,943 --> 00:29:14,778
BP 92 over 56.
Heart rate 48.

625
00:29:14,803 --> 00:29:16,466
Sats 73 and dropping.

626
00:29:18,094 --> 00:29:19,379
He's bradying down.

627
00:29:21,223 --> 00:29:22,964
Bilateral tension pneumothoraces.

628
00:29:22,989 --> 00:29:23,617
Two needle kits?

629
00:29:23,642 --> 00:29:25,165
Yeah, gotta decompress his chest.

630
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,125
What's happening?

631
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:27,937
Air's leaking into his
chest from his lungs.

632
00:29:27,962 --> 00:29:29,348
Now his lungs can't inflate.

633
00:29:33,774 --> 00:29:35,357
Second needle?

634
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,282
Sats and heart rate climbing.

635
00:29:42,306 --> 00:29:43,435
Set up for bilateral chest tubes.

636
00:29:43,459 --> 00:29:45,091
Otherwise his lungs are just
going to collapse again.

637
00:29:45,115 --> 00:29:45,689
Right.

638
00:29:45,714 --> 00:29:48,246
We'll need to send him up to
the ICU and get him on ECMO.

639
00:29:50,044 --> 00:29:51,650
Is this because you didn't know?

640
00:29:51,675 --> 00:29:53,669
It didn't help, Ingrid.

641
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:05,518
Evie.

642
00:30:06,005 --> 00:30:07,843
What's happening? Where
are they taking her?

643
00:30:07,868 --> 00:30:09,397
They'll explain.

644
00:30:10,855 --> 00:30:13,569
We're starting your daughter
on broad spectrum antibiotics

645
00:30:13,594 --> 00:30:15,684
and we're taking her up to surgery.

646
00:30:15,709 --> 00:30:17,406
Why?

647
00:30:17,854 --> 00:30:20,588
We... we were unable
to stop her bleeding,

648
00:30:20,613 --> 00:30:24,250
and also we were concerned
she could become septic.

649
00:30:24,857 --> 00:30:26,293
Oh, God.

650
00:30:26,318 --> 00:30:30,018
The procedure to address
this is simple, very low-risk.

651
00:30:30,043 --> 00:30:31,128
In all likelihood,

652
00:30:31,153 --> 00:30:33,304
she'll be able to go
home with you tomorrow.

653
00:30:33,329 --> 00:30:35,224
Okay.

654
00:30:35,706 --> 00:30:37,623
I'm still not clear.

655
00:30:37,648 --> 00:30:39,164
This procedure...

656
00:30:39,189 --> 00:30:41,313
Uh, it's to remove
degenerating tissue

657
00:30:41,338 --> 00:30:43,065
that's trapped in her uterus.

658
00:30:43,118 --> 00:30:45,184
- Her uterus?
- That's right.

659
00:30:49,417 --> 00:30:52,702
Okay, as long as she's
going to be all right.

660
00:30:53,196 --> 00:30:55,079
Yeah.

661
00:30:55,201 --> 00:30:57,187
Do you have any further questions?

662
00:30:59,908 --> 00:31:03,216
- No. No.
- Okay.

663
00:31:03,297 --> 00:31:05,725
Then why don't we have
someone take you up

664
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,186
to the waiting area?

665
00:31:07,537 --> 00:31:10,725
Monique, take Mr. Simpson
upstairs to join his wife.

666
00:31:10,981 --> 00:31:12,893
Sure.
This way, sir.

667
00:31:13,063 --> 00:31:14,499
Thank you.

668
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:23,440
Robin.

669
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:24,597
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.

670
00:31:24,622 --> 00:31:26,965
Oh, it's okay.
I'm fine.

671
00:31:27,771 --> 00:31:30,708
I was... uh, I-I was just so worried.

672
00:31:30,733 --> 00:31:34,004
You know... Dad, you know
I go swimming during lunch.

673
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:35,921
Do I know that?

674
00:31:36,376 --> 00:31:37,716
Uh, I don't think I know that.

675
00:31:37,741 --> 00:31:39,635
Yeah, well,
maybe you should listen.

676
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,366
How were they even
able to pull this off?

677
00:31:41,391 --> 00:31:43,843
I mean, they must've
known so much about you.

678
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:45,851
The cops said they
must've hacked my email.

679
00:31:45,876 --> 00:31:48,645
I mean, apparently this sort of
scam has been happening a lot.

680
00:31:50,904 --> 00:31:52,123
I'm really sorry.

681
00:31:52,148 --> 00:31:53,417
I-I-I've got to get back to the O.R.

682
00:31:53,441 --> 00:31:54,821
Oh, I'm fine, Connor.
Go.

683
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:58,785
- Okay, thank you.
- And change your passwords.

684
00:32:03,707 --> 00:32:04,871
Dr. Rhodes?

685
00:32:04,896 --> 00:32:06,426
Ms. Goodwin, I will explain
everything when I can

686
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:08,907
but I... right now I have got
to get back to the O.R.

687
00:32:08,932 --> 00:32:10,298
There's no hurry.

688
00:32:12,482 --> 00:32:14,470
- Mr. Montero?
- Did fine.

689
00:32:14,495 --> 00:32:16,472
They're closing him up now.

690
00:32:16,898 --> 00:32:18,600
Um...

691
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,292
uh, that's good.

692
00:32:20,317 --> 00:32:22,523
Since you ran out in
the middle of the surgery,

693
00:32:22,548 --> 00:32:24,899
I'd say it's very good.

694
00:32:25,349 --> 00:32:27,862
And now you have time to
tell me what happened.

695
00:32:34,463 --> 00:32:35,594
Hey.

696
00:32:35,619 --> 00:32:40,086
Sam is stable, on ECMO.

697
00:32:40,111 --> 00:32:42,548
That'll take the strain off
his lungs so they can heal.

698
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:46,133
He's got a long road ahead of
him but he should pull through.

699
00:32:46,689 --> 00:32:48,221
Good.

700
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,724
And look, I'm sorry.

701
00:32:51,328 --> 00:32:54,144
Even if I had known earlier
what caused his injuries,

702
00:32:54,169 --> 00:32:56,355
I don't think it would
have made a difference.

703
00:32:56,566 --> 00:32:58,483
Thank you.

704
00:32:59,499 --> 00:33:00,911
You can go and see him.

705
00:33:02,234 --> 00:33:03,781
Okay.

706
00:33:04,845 --> 00:33:07,245
You're still not gonna
tell me what happened?

707
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:33,092
We're fortunate Dr. Bekker
was able to take over

708
00:33:33,117 --> 00:33:36,529
for Dr. Rhodes when he
became incapacitated.

709
00:33:37,418 --> 00:33:39,450
She is a brilliant surgeon

710
00:33:40,139 --> 00:33:44,289
and she's proven herself a
worthy successor to Dr. Downey.

711
00:33:47,593 --> 00:33:48,943
Thank you.

712
00:33:49,412 --> 00:33:51,389
You're most welcome.

713
00:33:58,179 --> 00:34:01,686
I think we can all agree
that, thanks to Dr. Bekker,

714
00:34:01,711 --> 00:34:03,061
we're on our way to becoming

715
00:34:03,086 --> 00:34:05,488
a destination hospital once again.

716
00:34:13,223 --> 00:34:14,493
I heard what happened.

717
00:34:15,009 --> 00:34:16,578
That's awful.

718
00:34:17,112 --> 00:34:19,540
But Robin's okay? It was just a scam?

719
00:34:20,188 --> 00:34:22,378
- Yeah.
- So cruel.

720
00:34:22,403 --> 00:34:24,734
Well, thank you for stepping in.

721
00:34:24,759 --> 00:34:26,235
Of course.

722
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:29,158
I'm going to
go write up my notes.

723
00:34:32,396 --> 00:34:34,976
Looks like it all worked out
well for her.

724
00:34:36,869 --> 00:34:38,350
Yeah.

725
00:34:52,236 --> 00:34:53,870
Dr. Choi, Dr. Manning.

726
00:34:53,895 --> 00:34:56,335
I thought Jenny might be hungry.

727
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:59,111
And I wanted to thank you.

728
00:34:59,475 --> 00:35:01,216
The OB said she's gonna be fine.

729
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:02,886
Yes, everything went well.

730
00:35:02,911 --> 00:35:05,596
Yeah.
She's a good girl.

731
00:35:06,006 --> 00:35:07,767
Mr. Simpson.

732
00:35:10,031 --> 00:35:11,276
Take care.

733
00:35:11,301 --> 00:35:13,024
I will.
Thanks.

734
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:18,572
That man's being lied to
by us, his wife, his daughter.

735
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,226
I don't get you, Ethan.

736
00:35:21,464 --> 00:35:23,183
You believe that everyone has
a right to make decisions

737
00:35:23,207 --> 00:35:24,587
about their own body.

738
00:35:24,612 --> 00:35:26,833
It's not that.
It's the dishonesty.

739
00:35:27,216 --> 00:35:29,784
Listen, some people
don't want honesty.

740
00:35:29,952 --> 00:35:32,506
They find living with a
lie to be a lot easier.

741
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:36,053
Not me.

742
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:44,146
April?

743
00:35:45,504 --> 00:35:47,901
April, it's Ethan.

744
00:35:47,926 --> 00:35:49,819
Ethan, what are you doing?

745
00:35:50,154 --> 00:35:52,196
If... if you're seeing another guy,

746
00:35:52,221 --> 00:35:53,783
just tell me the truth.

747
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:56,438
Uh, y... you have no right
to come to my apartment

748
00:35:56,463 --> 00:35:58,163
demanding anything.

749
00:35:58,329 --> 00:36:01,249
You keep making excuses.
You cut your hair.

750
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:04,004
My hair?
So what?

751
00:36:04,151 --> 00:36:07,298
Just be honest with me.
I can handle it.

752
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:09,635
You're going to wake the baby.

753
00:36:10,047 --> 00:36:11,679
Emily.

754
00:36:12,099 --> 00:36:14,537
Why don't you come in?

755
00:36:35,013 --> 00:36:37,504
- Hey.
- Hey.

756
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:41,170
They're probably not going
to extubate him for a few days.

757
00:36:41,276 --> 00:36:43,552
You should go home, get some rest.

758
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:45,180
Okay.

759
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:54,513
Will, it wasn't because of security

760
00:36:54,538 --> 00:36:56,234
that I didn't tell you.

761
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,061
I trust you.

762
00:36:59,744 --> 00:37:01,094
Then why?

763
00:37:03,917 --> 00:37:06,373
I just didn't want
to burden you with it.

764
00:37:07,417 --> 00:37:08,667
Ingrid.

765
00:37:11,381 --> 00:37:13,840
I'm not really good
at letting people in,

766
00:37:14,528 --> 00:37:16,218
but I do know...

767
00:37:16,851 --> 00:37:20,890
sometimes burdens are easier
to bear if they're shared.

768
00:37:22,182 --> 00:37:23,665
You can tell me.

769
00:37:28,356 --> 00:37:29,735
Tell me.

770
00:37:33,398 --> 00:37:35,409
That raid on the meth lab?

771
00:37:36,419 --> 00:37:38,954
The suspect was supposed to be alone,

772
00:37:39,301 --> 00:37:41,207
but he had his kids with him.

773
00:37:41,805 --> 00:37:44,299
Twins, girls, six years old.

774
00:37:44,438 --> 00:37:49,843
And, um, rather than
surrender, he lit a match.

775
00:37:53,026 --> 00:37:55,116
Um...

776
00:37:56,867 --> 00:38:00,717
After the explosion when the
smoke started to clear,

777
00:38:00,742 --> 00:38:02,985
I could see that Sam was down.

778
00:38:04,253 --> 00:38:06,239
And then I, um...

779
00:38:07,959 --> 00:38:10,572
I just saw bits of them everywhere

780
00:38:12,634 --> 00:38:15,124
and then in the middle of all it...

781
00:38:16,338 --> 00:38:20,005
I-I saw a little girl's
toy, a pink unicorn.

782
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:22,341
It was perfect.

783
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,429
There wasn't a scratch on it.

784
00:38:35,517 --> 00:38:37,539
I got you.

785
00:38:42,773 --> 00:38:44,329
Bernie just needs some time.

786
00:38:44,354 --> 00:38:46,455
So April said I could stay with her.

787
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:47,933
But what's he doing at his wife's?

788
00:38:47,957 --> 00:38:49,651
- He left her.
- He did.

789
00:38:49,676 --> 00:38:52,949
But he misses her and
he misses his daughter.

790
00:38:53,274 --> 00:38:55,626
So we talked about it and
thought it would be good

791
00:38:55,659 --> 00:38:57,927
if they spent some time
together and, you know,

792
00:38:58,016 --> 00:38:59,597
just work things out.

793
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:01,683
Work what things out?
He has a baby.

794
00:39:01,708 --> 00:39:03,853
- Your baby.
- She knows that.

795
00:39:03,878 --> 00:39:05,645
Obviously you're fine with this.

796
00:39:05,827 --> 00:39:07,785
They're doing the best
they can, Ethan.

797
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:09,693
It doesn't sound that way to me.

798
00:39:11,113 --> 00:39:13,363
See, this is why I
didn't want him to know.

799
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,115
Okay, come here.

800
00:39:15,206 --> 00:39:17,243
Don't you want to meet your nephew?

801
00:39:17,642 --> 00:39:19,329
Come here, Em.

802
00:39:19,429 --> 00:39:21,415
Come on.

803
00:39:28,664 --> 00:39:30,427
His name is Vincent.

804
00:39:32,517 --> 00:39:33,841
Vincent.

805
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:36,727
After Grandpa.

806
00:39:37,089 --> 00:39:38,937
Mm-hmm.

807
00:39:41,127 --> 00:39:44,443
You know, I did cut
my hair because of a guy.

808
00:39:45,875 --> 00:39:48,282
Vincent likes to pull on it.

809
00:39:52,484 --> 00:39:54,456
Yes, I got that.

810
00:39:54,481 --> 00:39:55,787
Hey, Ma?

811
00:39:56,036 --> 00:39:58,236
So Dad has had a bit of a rough day

812
00:39:58,261 --> 00:40:00,963
and wants to know if we can all
go out to dinner together.

813
00:40:01,253 --> 00:40:03,760
So why isn't he asking me himself?

814
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:06,079
Oh, I wouldn't want you to think

815
00:40:06,104 --> 00:40:08,140
that I was being manipulative.

816
00:40:08,165 --> 00:40:09,976
Oh.

817
00:40:10,516 --> 00:40:12,041
Tell him I like steak.

818
00:40:15,106 --> 00:40:18,371
Not for nothing, you were
absolutely right this morning

819
00:40:18,396 --> 00:40:19,696
about Mackinac Island.

820
00:40:19,721 --> 00:40:21,407
Okay, now you're being
really manipulative.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
