1
00:00:15,052 --> 00:00:16,475
There's no milk.

2
00:00:16,682 --> 00:00:17,714
Oh.

3
00:00:17,728 --> 00:00:19,057
Damn, I forgot.

4
00:00:19,302 --> 00:00:21,350
All I ask is for you to get the groceries.

5
00:00:21,392 --> 00:00:23,646
And I forgot. I'm sorry.

6
00:00:24,207 --> 00:00:26,581
You know, I-I-it's not
like I'm sitting around.

7
00:00:26,582 --> 00:00:27,857
I'm-I'm looking for a job.

8
00:00:27,858 --> 00:00:29,305
Well, now we're gonna
have to stop for coffee

9
00:00:29,306 --> 00:00:30,987
before you drop me off at work.

10
00:00:31,451 --> 00:00:33,306
Even good marriages fail.

11
00:00:33,664 --> 00:00:35,886
One minute you're standing on solid ground.

12
00:00:36,198 --> 00:00:38,454
The next minute... you're not.

13
00:00:43,214 --> 00:00:43,805
Baby's up.

14
00:00:43,806 --> 00:00:45,578
You change the diaper. I'll get the bottle.

15
00:00:47,087 --> 00:00:49,102
And there's always two versions...

16
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,426
Yours...

17
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:57,637
and theirs.

18
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:58,978
So they're living together

19
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:00,746
at your house,

20
00:01:00,747 --> 00:01:01,990
Kepner says.

21
00:01:01,991 --> 00:01:03,661
This is my house.

22
00:01:04,263 --> 00:01:05,575
Did she say how they're doing?

23
00:01:05,576 --> 00:01:08,018
No. I didn't ask.

24
00:01:08,019 --> 00:01:09,372
I don't care.

25
00:01:10,296 --> 00:01:11,161
You...

26
00:01:11,162 --> 00:01:13,196
You want me to ask, for you?

27
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:16,062
No. I don't care, either.

28
00:01:19,818 --> 00:01:21,014
Hand me a rock.

29
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:32,442
Okay. I'm... I can't-I can't-I can't.

30
00:01:32,443 --> 00:01:34,653
Um, I can't have sex when there's a baby

31
00:01:34,654 --> 00:01:36,193
from a broken home in the next room.

32
00:01:36,194 --> 00:01:37,298
I...

33
00:01:38,734 --> 00:01:41,279
Both versions start the same way, though.

34
00:01:42,471 --> 00:01:45,126
Both start with two people falling in love.

35
00:01:46,844 --> 00:01:48,075
Yeah, you can.

36
00:01:48,543 --> 00:01:49,871
Just look at me.

37
00:01:53,787 --> 00:01:55,403
It's just you and me.

38
00:02:09,151 --> 00:02:11,111
Dude... you snore like a truck.

39
00:02:11,112 --> 00:02:12,657
I'm gonna put a note in your chart,

40
00:02:12,658 --> 00:02:14,606
'cause you mix apnea with your heart crap,

41
00:02:14,607 --> 00:02:16,527
and you're dead before you're 60.

42
00:02:21,271 --> 00:02:22,418
Excuse me.

43
00:02:23,001 --> 00:02:23,593
- Hey.
- Hey.

44
00:02:23,594 --> 00:02:24,789
You guys going to that breakfast thing?

45
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,590
Uh, yeah, after we drop her off at day care.

46
00:02:26,591 --> 00:02:29,898
Oh, my god. Look at her. She's so beautiful.

47
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,841
Oh, oh. Hey.

48
00:02:31,842 --> 00:02:34,142
- Hey, you are so beautiful...
- Here you go.

49
00:02:34,143 --> 00:02:35,630
And you've got the best mommies.

50
00:02:35,631 --> 00:02:37,663
Did you know that? Yes, you do.

51
00:02:37,963 --> 00:02:39,302
Oh, you do.

52
00:02:39,303 --> 00:02:41,757
Oh, you so do.

53
00:02:41,758 --> 00:02:43,753
Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.

54
00:02:43,754 --> 00:02:44,818
What is wrong with her?

55
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:47,330
Mm, she's getting laid.
She's unnaturally cheerful.

56
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,569
Oh. Yes, you do. Peekaboo.

57
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,873
A month ago you were in med school

58
00:02:49,874 --> 00:02:51,089
being taught by doctors.

59
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,314
And now you are the doctors.

60
00:02:53,315 --> 00:02:55,358
Will we be going into an O.R. today?

61
00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:56,852
Oh, I hope so.

62
00:02:56,853 --> 00:02:57,942
Oh.

63
00:02:58,396 --> 00:03:00,594
Oh. New interns.

64
00:03:00,595 --> 00:03:01,573
I hate new interns.

65
00:03:01,574 --> 00:03:03,314
Seriously? Ugh. Mm-hmm.

66
00:03:03,315 --> 00:03:04,821
I love new interns.

67
00:03:04,822 --> 00:03:06,219
They're the future,

68
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,045
the next generation...

69
00:03:08,046 --> 00:03:10,722
filled with hope and promise, innovation.

70
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:11,826
Wow.

71
00:03:11,888 --> 00:03:13,814
The sex with Henry must be really good.

72
00:03:13,815 --> 00:03:15,047
Earth-shattering.

73
00:03:15,265 --> 00:03:17,874
- Shh. Sex.
- Not even Yang's gonna get me down.

74
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,319
No, she's not.

75
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,163
Good morning

76
00:03:22,164 --> 00:03:24,675
And welcome to your fifth year of residency.

77
00:03:24,762 --> 00:03:25,577
- Oh, morning.
- Morning.

78
00:03:25,578 --> 00:03:26,712
See you guys up there.

79
00:03:26,713 --> 00:03:28,279
I hear there's an omelet station.

80
00:03:28,362 --> 00:03:29,979
- Thank you.
- Okay

81
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,689
you have a good day.

82
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,446
Okay, now. Bye-bye.

83
00:03:42,568 --> 00:03:43,985
Okay, um, I'll see you later...

84
00:03:43,986 --> 00:03:45,548
- Okay.
- At the thing.

85
00:03:48,723 --> 00:03:50,457
She slept through the night...

86
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,088
- Hey, Zola.
- And ate like a champ.

87
00:03:52,089 --> 00:03:53,037
I missed you.

88
00:03:53,038 --> 00:03:54,082
Can we talk?

89
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,113
I want to spend time with Zola

90
00:03:55,114 --> 00:03:56,746
before I drop her off at day care.

91
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:02,923
Are you gonna call Glen today?

92
00:04:03,023 --> 00:04:03,713
I don't know.

93
00:04:03,714 --> 00:04:05,826
I, you know, the g... the guy is an ass.

94
00:04:05,827 --> 00:04:07,442
Do I really want to work for him?

95
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,414
Maybe you should stop being so choosy.

96
00:04:10,415 --> 00:04:12,605
Well, I just got laid off
four months ago. All right?

97
00:04:12,606 --> 00:04:13,649
I mean, these things take time.

98
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,917
It's all about pursuing leads
and making connections.

99
00:04:15,918 --> 00:04:17,777
I know how a person gets a job, Danny.

100
00:04:17,778 --> 00:04:19,375
I have one, remember?

101
00:04:26,578 --> 00:04:28,174
Good morning, and, uh,

102
00:04:28,175 --> 00:04:30,806
welcome to your final year of residency.

103
00:04:31,362 --> 00:04:32,089
Um...

104
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,700
This-this breakfast is the one time

105
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:35,597
when all the fifth years and the attendings

106
00:04:35,598 --> 00:04:36,870
will be in the same room,

107
00:04:36,871 --> 00:04:39,927
so... so use your time wisely, residents...

108
00:04:40,755 --> 00:04:42,514
Find a mentor...

109
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,823
Ask questions, get advice on your futures.

110
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:50,289
And, um, I see you're already chatting away,

111
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,115
so that's... that's good.

112
00:04:52,306 --> 00:04:54,164
Just carry on.

113
00:05:01,423 --> 00:05:03,182
Dr. Bailey, how did you do it?

114
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:06,902
I put down the english muffin first,

115
00:05:06,903 --> 00:05:08,213
- then the bacon, then the eggs.
- Oh, no...

116
00:05:08,214 --> 00:05:10,741
Now some people may be
surprised by this method,

117
00:05:10,742 --> 00:05:13,050
thinking you put
the bacon on top of the eggs,

118
00:05:13,051 --> 00:05:14,025
and those people

119
00:05:14,026 --> 00:05:16,635
would be right, because...

120
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,097
You see what I'm doing?

121
00:05:19,136 --> 00:05:19,850
Bam!

122
00:05:19,851 --> 00:05:22,692
An extra layer of bacon

123
00:05:22,693 --> 00:05:23,914
right on top.

124
00:05:23,915 --> 00:05:26,507
Then you put on the other
half of the muffin.

125
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:29,073
And there you go.
That's a breakfast sandwich.

126
00:05:29,074 --> 00:05:31,066
Uh, no, no, I, uh, I mean,

127
00:05:31,067 --> 00:05:33,006
how did you get people to listen to you

128
00:05:33,007 --> 00:05:33,701
as chief resident?

129
00:05:33,702 --> 00:05:36,302
Dr. Kepner, I am eating.
Leave me alone with my food.

130
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:37,251
Figure it out on your own.

131
00:05:37,252 --> 00:05:38,591
Oh, w...

132
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:40,996
Did he talk to you?

133
00:05:40,997 --> 00:05:42,638
No, he won't even look at me.

134
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,438
Well... you tampered
with his clinical trial.

135
00:05:45,538 --> 00:05:47,050
He thinks that's kind of unforgivable.

136
00:05:47,051 --> 00:05:49,332
- It was for Adele and the chief...
- You know, I know you...

137
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,382
You regret that you messed up his trial

138
00:05:51,383 --> 00:05:52,769
but not what you did, I know.

139
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,566
You don't have to defend yourself to me.

140
00:05:54,995 --> 00:05:56,161
I'm kind of...

141
00:05:56,162 --> 00:05:58,030
unforgivable myself, remember?

142
00:05:58,031 --> 00:05:59,657
But you're not. Not yet at least.

143
00:05:59,658 --> 00:06:01,058
Have you told him?

144
00:06:01,059 --> 00:06:02,193
Well...

145
00:06:02,549 --> 00:06:04,657
I call him, he doesn't pick up.

146
00:06:04,658 --> 00:06:06,412
He sees me, he walks away.

147
00:06:06,413 --> 00:06:07,507
Okay, I'm not gonna yell...

148
00:06:07,508 --> 00:06:08,737
"I didn't get the abortion yet"

149
00:06:08,738 --> 00:06:10,043
down the hallway.

150
00:06:10,066 --> 00:06:12,410
Well, so are you going
to go through with it,

151
00:06:12,411 --> 00:06:15,051
or are we gonna sit there again
and not get the abortion?

152
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:19,398
Tonight. 6:00. I'm doing it.

153
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,542
Oh. Gotta go suck up to Teddy.

154
00:06:24,855 --> 00:06:26,109
You want plastics?

155
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,278
I don't see it.

156
00:06:28,015 --> 00:06:28,830
Is this about Lexie?

157
00:06:28,831 --> 00:06:30,130
'Cause I thought you were good with that.

158
00:06:30,131 --> 00:06:32,179
This isn't about sex. It's about medicine.

159
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:34,573
Then I don't understand.

160
00:06:34,574 --> 00:06:36,010
You're a good surgeon.

161
00:06:36,834 --> 00:06:38,126
Not a great surgeon,

162
00:06:38,127 --> 00:06:40,270
which is why I was surprised
Lexie was even into you.

163
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,926
But this isn't about Lexie.

164
00:06:43,783 --> 00:06:44,791
Nope.

165
00:06:47,214 --> 00:06:48,654
How's she doing, by the way?

166
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:52,398
Wow.

167
00:06:55,283 --> 00:06:57,330
Oh, god. What is she doing here?

168
00:06:57,993 --> 00:07:00,153
I don't... What?

169
00:07:00,163 --> 00:07:01,337
Is what you're thinking, right?

170
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,249
I mean, you thought that
I would run away to Germany

171
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,625
and you wouldn't have to see me again,

172
00:07:04,626 --> 00:07:06,314
which was a relief,

173
00:07:06,315 --> 00:07:08,109
I mean, after all the drama
that we've been through

174
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,296
in the last year.

175
00:07:10,355 --> 00:07:13,027
I'm right. Tell me I'm right.

176
00:07:13,059 --> 00:07:13,690
I...

177
00:07:13,691 --> 00:07:15,390
Okay, so here's the deal... I'm here

178
00:07:15,391 --> 00:07:17,441
and I'm in a happy place
and I'm done with drama.

179
00:07:17,442 --> 00:07:19,691
So if you want to learn, I want to teach.

180
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:21,202
G-g-great.

181
00:07:21,203 --> 00:07:22,348
Yay.

182
00:07:24,814 --> 00:07:26,386
Alex, this is serious.

183
00:07:26,387 --> 00:07:28,230
If you want the peds fellowship next year,

184
00:07:28,231 --> 00:07:29,457
you're gonna have to earn it.

185
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,998
I just brought over a bunch
of sick kids from Africa.

186
00:07:31,999 --> 00:07:33,474
Well, did you publish and article about it?

187
00:07:33,475 --> 00:07:35,305
Because all the people
applying for peds fellowships,

188
00:07:35,306 --> 00:07:36,270
they've all been published.

189
00:07:36,271 --> 00:07:37,429
You're already getting resumes?

190
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,911
Yes, and you're way behind.

191
00:07:38,912 --> 00:07:40,838
Listen, I-I hate to kick
a guy when he's down, but...

192
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,754
Down? Who's down? I'm not down?

193
00:07:43,035 --> 00:07:45,365
Everybody hates you because you
narced on a fellow surgeon.

194
00:07:45,366 --> 00:07:47,469
You're a pariah.
You're living in the hospital,

195
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:49,327
and you look like a bum and you've...

196
00:07:49,966 --> 00:07:51,519
got really bad breath.

197
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:52,571
Really...

198
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:53,778
really bad.

199
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:55,105
Do you need me to go on?

200
00:07:55,106 --> 00:07:56,467
- I...
- No, I'm good.

201
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,204
Oh! Look, here's the chief!

202
00:08:01,338 --> 00:08:02,224
Chief,

203
00:08:02,225 --> 00:08:04,103
is there, uh, anything you'd like to say

204
00:08:04,104 --> 00:08:06,935
as we embark on our final year of residency?

205
00:08:12,854 --> 00:08:14,366
You all know what you're doing.

206
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:16,664
Just don't kill anyone.

207
00:08:18,115 --> 00:08:21,185
Uh, Meredith, can I see you in my office?

208
00:08:25,888 --> 00:08:28,719
Well, that was very... inspirational.

209
00:08:29,086 --> 00:08:30,350
Thank you, chief.

210
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,113
Nobody gets married

211
00:08:33,114 --> 00:08:34,654
thinking it's gonna fail.

212
00:08:34,655 --> 00:08:37,438
Well, you're the one who
needed the big wedding.

213
00:08:37,614 --> 00:08:39,001
What is that supposed to mean?

214
00:08:39,002 --> 00:08:40,545
It means, if we still had our savings,

215
00:08:40,546 --> 00:08:42,714
my being laid off wouldn't
be such a big deal.

216
00:08:42,851 --> 00:08:44,158
No, we decided on that together.

217
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,269
We both wanted that wedding.

218
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,693
No, we didn't.

219
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:48,553
You and your mother are the...

220
00:08:48,574 --> 00:08:50,379
- Stop the car.
- Calm down.

221
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,610
- I mean it, Danny.
- You're being crazy.

222
00:08:52,611 --> 00:08:54,369
What, are you gonna walk to work from here?

223
00:08:54,511 --> 00:08:55,618
What the hell are you doing?

224
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:57,097
Stop the car!

225
00:08:57,098 --> 00:08:59,272
You think yours is
the one that's gonna make it.

226
00:09:00,547 --> 00:09:02,882
Derek's refusing to work with me, isn't he?

227
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,831
The board met this morning.

228
00:09:08,883 --> 00:09:10,981
They feel that a suspension

229
00:09:10,982 --> 00:09:12,647
would send the wrong message.

230
00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:16,501
They feel that what you did

231
00:09:16,502 --> 00:09:18,135
disgraced the hospital...

232
00:09:19,318 --> 00:09:20,598
the profession.

233
00:09:23,555 --> 00:09:24,787
I'm sorry, I...

234
00:09:26,194 --> 00:09:27,911
I did everything I could.

235
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:31,455
So what are you saying?

236
00:09:36,022 --> 00:09:37,223
You're fired,

237
00:09:37,687 --> 00:09:39,350
effective immediately.

238
00:09:40,271 --> 00:09:42,703
You're no longer a doctor at Seattle Grace.

239
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:45,375
And so it always comes as a shock...

240
00:09:46,755 --> 00:09:48,882
the moment when you realize, it's over.

241
00:09:48,926 --> 00:09:50,784
You walk away, and I swear, that's it.

242
00:09:50,785 --> 00:09:52,870
All right, I-I am not gonna chase after you.

243
00:09:52,871 --> 00:09:54,872
You get out of this car, and we are done.

244
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:05,818
Susannah!

245
00:10:10,358 --> 00:10:11,757
Whoa! Ohh!

246
00:10:11,758 --> 00:10:14,111
One minute you're standing on solid ground.

247
00:10:14,538 --> 00:10:16,603
The next minute you're not.

248
00:10:27,887 --> 00:10:29,750
We're going to the scene
of an onsite amputation

249
00:10:29,751 --> 00:10:31,430
woman's trapped under her car.

250
00:10:31,442 --> 00:10:32,990
You guys are gonna get swamped with bodies.

251
00:10:32,991 --> 00:10:34,897
Kepner, you're in charge till I get back.

252
00:10:34,898 --> 00:10:36,114
Yes, sir. Have fun.

253
00:10:36,115 --> 00:10:37,021
At an amputation?

254
00:10:37,022 --> 00:10:38,814
Uh, I-I meant good luck.

255
00:10:42,306 --> 00:10:44,106
You know what? There's bound
to be piles of head trauma.

256
00:10:44,107 --> 00:10:45,405
Derek's gonna have to talk to you.

257
00:10:45,406 --> 00:10:46,846
I got fired.

258
00:10:47,343 --> 00:10:48,462
What?

259
00:10:51,626 --> 00:10:53,450
The chief fired me.

260
00:10:54,895 --> 00:10:56,303
You son of a bitch.

261
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:57,782
I mean, are you happy now?

262
00:10:57,783 --> 00:10:59,185
'Cause this is all because of you.

263
00:10:59,186 --> 00:11:00,515
You and your big fat, stupid mouth!

264
00:11:00,516 --> 00:11:02,698
- Get off me. Get off!
- Kepner, control your people.

265
00:11:02,699 --> 00:11:03,954
- Stop! Stop!
- All your fault!

266
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,722
- Get off.
- There's no hitting. No hitting.

267
00:11:05,723 --> 00:11:08,579
- Would you stop right now?
- Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

268
00:11:09,515 --> 00:11:11,201
- You going to the scene?
- Yes.

269
00:11:11,202 --> 00:11:14,307
Wait. Wait. I didn't tell you
you could go. I need you here.

270
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,373
42-year-old female.
Lost consciousness en route.

271
00:11:17,374 --> 00:11:20,158
Unable to get airway
secondary to tracheal injury.

272
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:22,655
Last B.P. is 89 over 60.

273
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,315
Don't worry. We'll figure something out.

274
00:11:24,824 --> 00:11:26,806
Make sure there is a crike tray
set up with the intubation kit.

275
00:11:26,807 --> 00:11:27,799
Yes, doctor.

276
00:11:28,034 --> 00:11:30,052
Come on. You can't be here. You need to go.

277
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:44,727
It's not stable. Get away from there.

278
00:11:51,672 --> 00:11:53,186
- Oh, Dr. Torres?
- Yeah, hi.

279
00:11:53,187 --> 00:11:54,178
Dr. Hunt?

280
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:56,122
Karen Lorenz, in charge
of search and rescue.

281
00:11:56,123 --> 00:11:57,630
We're still pulling
victims out of the debris,

282
00:11:57,631 --> 00:12:00,038
but we have a couple...
Danny and Susannah Wilson...

283
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:01,073
stuck down there.

284
00:12:01,074 --> 00:12:02,925
He has a head wound and
his ankle's messed up,

285
00:12:02,926 --> 00:12:04,458
but I don't see any other obvious injuries.

286
00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:05,817
We could potentially bring him up,

287
00:12:05,818 --> 00:12:07,012
but he won't leave without his wife,

288
00:12:07,013 --> 00:12:08,748
and her leg is stuck under the car.

289
00:12:24,948 --> 00:12:26,493
Take it easy. You'll be all right.

290
00:12:41,747 --> 00:12:44,118
I hope you've got me with a decent resident.

291
00:12:44,119 --> 00:12:46,802
I'm not babysitting any
first-day first years today.

292
00:12:46,803 --> 00:12:48,852
Yep, I got you with Meredith.

293
00:12:48,895 --> 00:12:51,200
- Coming through.
- Oh, wait. Um, that's not gonna...
that's okay.

294
00:12:51,201 --> 00:12:52,653
Uh, not a problem. I can fix this.

295
00:12:52,654 --> 00:12:54,682
Uh, Jackson, can I get
you with Bailey today?

296
00:12:54,683 --> 00:12:56,117
I'm already with Sloan. Sorry.

297
00:12:56,118 --> 00:12:57,809
Uh, okay. Uh, Yang. Yang.

298
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,335
- Can I get you to...
- No.

299
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:01,129
Okay.

300
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,669
Um, sorry. Hang on.

301
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:05,872
Let me just, um... just figure this out.

302
00:13:05,873 --> 00:13:07,918
Hey, Grey. You're with me.

303
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:08,959
Yes, ma'am.

304
00:13:09,349 --> 00:13:12,343
Uh, okay. Great. There we go.

305
00:13:16,448 --> 00:13:18,464
Dr. Kepner, three more coming in.

306
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:19,619
Okay.

307
00:13:21,895 --> 00:13:23,577
It was a water main break on 3rd.

308
00:13:23,578 --> 00:13:25,389
Probably been going on for weeks,
and it just gave way.

309
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,813
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

310
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,293
We've got a vitals monitor and a camera,

311
00:13:28,294 --> 00:13:30,218
- so we have a visual.
- Danny, can you hear me?

312
00:13:30,219 --> 00:13:32,134
She's-she's not talking anymore.

313
00:13:32,135 --> 00:13:33,174
You gotta-you gotta get down here.

314
00:13:33,175 --> 00:13:35,661
- We need help.
- Danny, Danny, I'm Dr. Hunt.
Can you read out for me

315
00:13:35,662 --> 00:13:37,678
the top three numbers on the monitor?

316
00:13:39,282 --> 00:13:40,569
Um... 87.

317
00:13:40,977 --> 00:13:42,181
63.

318
00:13:42,182 --> 00:13:43,238
122.

319
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,705
B.P.'s 87 over 63.

320
00:13:44,706 --> 00:13:46,439
She's shocky. How do we get down to her?

321
00:13:46,443 --> 00:13:47,898
You don't. It's too unstable.

322
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:49,930
The whole thing would cave
in if we sent you down there.

323
00:13:50,134 --> 00:13:51,254
By the time we get it shored up enough

324
00:13:51,255 --> 00:13:53,247
to get someone down there,
she'll be dead for sure.

325
00:13:53,248 --> 00:13:55,265
I thought that's why we're here,
for the amputation.

326
00:13:56,238 --> 00:13:57,774
You're gonna talk him through it.

327
00:13:57,775 --> 00:14:00,282
You want him to cut off his wife's leg?

328
00:14:00,283 --> 00:14:01,698
Hey, you guys, I think she's dying.

329
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:05,082
You gotta get us outta here!
Please hurry. Hurry!

330
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:12,668
Dr. Yang, can you tell me
why you entered the pleura

331
00:14:12,669 --> 00:14:13,923
with a Kelly clamp?

332
00:14:14,023 --> 00:14:15,927
Why? What's wrong? Am I too low?

333
00:14:16,141 --> 00:14:17,605
Do you suspect a traumatic herniation?

334
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,167
No, no. I just want to know you're thinking.

335
00:14:20,974 --> 00:14:22,983
'Cause that's how you put a chest tube in.

336
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:23,950
Why?

337
00:14:23,951 --> 00:14:25,294
What do you mean, why?

338
00:14:25,295 --> 00:14:26,989
So you don't kill
the person when you do it wrong.

339
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,850
Well, tell me like I'm an idiot.

340
00:14:28,851 --> 00:14:31,234
Uh, like I'm a medical student.

341
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:32,314
Why?

342
00:14:32,315 --> 00:14:34,969
I need to make sure that
your foundation is solid.

343
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:37,385
Why? I'm asking the questions,
Cristina, not you.

344
00:14:37,386 --> 00:14:39,603
Tell me why you entered the pleura that way.

345
00:14:45,095 --> 00:14:47,050
What? Is Zola all right?

346
00:14:47,051 --> 00:14:48,889
It's not-it's... she's fine. It's me.

347
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:50,414
- I have to go.
- Derek...

348
00:14:50,415 --> 00:14:51,926
Meredith, I can't. I just-I...

349
00:14:51,927 --> 00:14:53,394
I got fired.

350
00:14:58,182 --> 00:14:59,703
What did you think was gonna happen?

351
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:13,061
Danny, you've got a kit.

352
00:15:13,062 --> 00:15:15,081
Now they're sending down a second harness.

353
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:17,153
The doctors are gonna talk
you through this, okay?

354
00:15:17,154 --> 00:15:18,163
Okay.

355
00:15:21,042 --> 00:15:22,203
What can I do?

356
00:15:22,527 --> 00:15:24,405
Kepner called. She wants
you back at the hospital.

357
00:15:24,406 --> 00:15:25,094
I can't go back there.

358
00:15:25,095 --> 00:15:26,665
Yeah, it sucks that everyone hates you.

359
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,314
But you're not hiding out here. Go.

360
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,086
Did you get the kit open?

361
00:15:31,123 --> 00:15:32,351
Almost.

362
00:15:35,486 --> 00:15:37,658
Oh, my God. No.

363
00:15:37,659 --> 00:15:39,350
No. No, no. No, no, no. I-I-I can't do this.

364
00:15:39,351 --> 00:15:41,838
Danny, Danny, you can do this.

365
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,518
We have one chance to bring you both up.

366
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,930
In order to do that,
you have to amputate Susannah's leg.

367
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:49,486
Oh, no. No.

368
00:15:49,586 --> 00:15:51,635
Oh, God. Oh.

369
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:56,942
I need a C-spine!

370
00:15:58,078 --> 00:15:59,997
Coming through, people.
Come on. Watch your back.

371
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:02,072
You guys headed back?

372
00:16:02,073 --> 00:16:03,162
Yeah, we are.

373
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:09,678
Does anybody have a kid?

374
00:16:12,216 --> 00:16:14,358
Has anybody seen a kid around?

375
00:16:19,531 --> 00:16:21,115
Where'd they pull this guy from?

376
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:24,655
We'll need immediate transport for her.

377
00:16:24,803 --> 00:16:26,221
Yeah, give me just a minute here, doctor.

378
00:16:26,222 --> 00:16:27,710
I just gotta stabilize her.

379
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,872
I need some help over here!

380
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:46,786
He's not breathing.

381
00:16:46,999 --> 00:16:48,822
Get an ambu bag and some oxygen over here.

382
00:16:48,823 --> 00:16:49,958
Right away, doctor.

383
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,341
Oh, jeez. What happened? No.

384
00:17:00,342 --> 00:17:02,169
No, no, no, no, no, no. I need help.

385
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:03,281
I-I think my patient's coding.

386
00:17:03,282 --> 00:17:05,034
You think your patient's coding?

387
00:17:05,035 --> 00:17:06,147
What's his rhythm?

388
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:07,885
Uh...

389
00:17:07,886 --> 00:17:08,901
S.V.T.?

390
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,630
- Sinus tach?
- Okay, there shouldn't be a question mark

391
00:17:10,631 --> 00:17:11,513
at the end of that sentence.

392
00:17:11,514 --> 00:17:12,274
I don't know. I'm freaking out.

393
00:17:12,275 --> 00:17:14,269
It's my first day of internship.
How could this be happening?

394
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,478
Go back to your patient.
Does he have a pulse?

395
00:17:18,724 --> 00:17:19,417
He has a pulse.

396
00:17:19,418 --> 00:17:21,371
Good. Now check for breath sounds.

397
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:26,217
Uh, I kinda hear some,

398
00:17:26,218 --> 00:17:28,042
but maybe the right sounds less?

399
00:17:28,043 --> 00:17:29,398
You gotta stop with the questions.

400
00:17:29,399 --> 00:17:31,105
It kinda looks like
he's barely breathing at all now.

401
00:17:31,106 --> 00:17:32,482
Move, move, move.

402
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:35,702
Tension pneumothorax.
Grab the biggest needle you can find.

403
00:17:35,703 --> 00:17:36,362
What are you doing?

404
00:17:36,363 --> 00:17:38,018
Tension pneumo. This guy's freaking out.

405
00:17:38,019 --> 00:17:40,451
Step away, Grey.

406
00:17:42,826 --> 00:17:44,738
Uh... 14-guage? 16-guage?

407
00:17:44,739 --> 00:17:46,770
The biggest needle you can find!

408
00:17:56,246 --> 00:17:58,542
Okay. Get this man a chest tube.

409
00:17:58,543 --> 00:18:00,206
And next time, call your resident.

410
00:18:00,207 --> 00:18:01,797
I'm sorry. I-I thought
that she was a resident.

411
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:03,529
No, she is not a resident.

412
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:05,669
She was fired by this hospital.

413
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,981
Had this man died under her care,

414
00:18:07,982 --> 00:18:10,042
the hospital would be sued,
you would be sued,

415
00:18:10,043 --> 00:18:11,518
hell, maybe even I would be sued.

416
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:14,063
Now get this man a chest tube, and, Grey,

417
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,300
get the hell outta here.

418
00:18:21,966 --> 00:18:24,253
Pulse is not good.
His breath sounds are shallow.

419
00:18:24,254 --> 00:18:25,775
His name's Nicky Hoffman.

420
00:18:30,098 --> 00:18:32,037
Pulse is minimal on this side, too.

421
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:34,631
Come on, Nicky. I need you
to do better than this.

422
00:18:34,632 --> 00:18:35,680
Thready pulses,

423
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:38,196
multiple rib fractures with
decreased respirations...

424
00:18:38,197 --> 00:18:39,301
His body's shutting down.

425
00:18:39,302 --> 00:18:40,531
Could be compartment syndrome.

426
00:18:40,532 --> 00:18:42,739
That could be why his radial
pulses are so decreased.

427
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,881
We need to do bilateral fasciotomies

428
00:18:44,882 --> 00:18:45,825
and relieve the pressure.

429
00:18:45,826 --> 00:18:47,271
Do we have a scalpel?

430
00:18:49,135 --> 00:18:50,211
Push 5 of morphine.

431
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,279
Got it.

432
00:18:53,768 --> 00:18:54,807
Okay.

433
00:18:57,691 --> 00:18:58,638
All right.

434
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:00,246
Okay, you do the fasciotomies.

435
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,720
You're the fifth year.

436
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:05,727
All right.

437
00:19:11,782 --> 00:19:14,070
Okay, his pulse is stronger now.

438
00:19:14,463 --> 00:19:15,586
Good. Do the other one.

439
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:16,770
Sponge.

440
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:19,190
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

441
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:32,674
Nice job. You got this?

442
00:19:32,987 --> 00:19:34,172
- Yeah.
- All right.

443
00:19:35,544 --> 00:19:36,393
Hey.

444
00:19:36,394 --> 00:19:37,804
Hey, Nicky. I'm Alex.

445
00:19:37,805 --> 00:19:38,991
I'm a doctor.

446
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:40,830
You had a pretty bad accident.

447
00:19:46,403 --> 00:19:47,665
We need a gunther.

448
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,744
Dr. Bailey, it's the first
day of fifth year. I...

449
00:19:49,745 --> 00:19:51,074
And they're at each other's throats.

450
00:19:51,075 --> 00:19:51,810
We need a gunther.

451
00:19:51,811 --> 00:19:53,378
I've got more pressing problems.

452
00:19:53,379 --> 00:19:56,069
I'm trying to find a new
spot for Meredith Grey.

453
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,133
You know, I heard they have
a new research fellowship

454
00:19:58,134 --> 00:19:59,394
at Mass Gen.

455
00:19:59,395 --> 00:20:00,885
I thought a recommendation from you might...

456
00:20:00,886 --> 00:20:03,258
You want me to write a recommendation

457
00:20:03,259 --> 00:20:04,621
for Meredith Grey?

458
00:20:04,622 --> 00:20:06,207
By the end of the day would be fine.

459
00:20:06,575 --> 00:20:08,444
"To whom it may concern,"

460
00:20:08,445 --> 00:20:10,897
"Meredith Grey is an excellent example"

461
00:20:10,898 --> 00:20:11,970
of the kind of resident"

462
00:20:11,971 --> 00:20:14,241
"you absolutely should not hire."

463
00:20:14,242 --> 00:20:17,349
"She undermines groundbreaking
clinical trials,"

464
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,077
"she has absolutely no
respect for rules, authority,"

465
00:20:20,078 --> 00:20:21,517
"or, as it turns out,"

466
00:20:21,518 --> 00:20:23,994
"the oath that she took
when she became a doctor."

467
00:20:23,995 --> 00:20:27,181
"She will most likely tarnish
the reputation of you,"

468
00:20:27,182 --> 00:20:29,011
"your doctors, and your hospital."

469
00:20:29,367 --> 00:20:31,623
"Sincerely, Dr. Miranda Bailey."

470
00:20:32,903 --> 00:20:35,975
Meredith Grey is
the reason we need a gunther.

471
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:42,414
Jerry Hoffman.

472
00:20:42,415 --> 00:20:45,434
C.T. showed a traumatic
subarachnoid hemorrhage.

473
00:20:45,435 --> 00:20:47,261
I cleaned and splinted his humerus fracture

474
00:20:47,262 --> 00:20:49,403
and sutured his facial lacerations.

475
00:20:49,586 --> 00:20:51,630
Well, he won't need surgery,
but let's do a neuro exam

476
00:20:51,631 --> 00:20:53,070
every two hours just to make sure.

477
00:20:53,071 --> 00:20:55,071
Let's take a look at your handiwork.

478
00:20:56,684 --> 00:20:58,045
Oh, dear god.

479
00:20:58,274 --> 00:21:00,322
My grandmother could sew
up a stuffed turkey...

480
00:21:00,323 --> 00:21:01,230
- It was...
- Better than this.

481
00:21:01,499 --> 00:21:02,750
Pretty, uh, jagged in there, so...

482
00:21:02,751 --> 00:21:05,641
- You ever heard of burying your stitches?
- All right.

483
00:21:05,642 --> 00:21:07,898
So I will fix it.

484
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:09,913
Oh, Jackson.

485
00:21:09,914 --> 00:21:10,921
There's a new patient in bed 3.

486
00:21:10,922 --> 00:21:11,489
Kinda busy, April.

487
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:13,668
Yeah, kinda busy turning
this guy into Frankenstein.

488
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:15,911
Go. Go. Make yourself useful.

489
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:17,737
All right, I'm gonna fix this.

490
00:21:17,738 --> 00:21:18,778
Mm-hmm.

491
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,771
Don't you think you're being
a little hard on the kid?

492
00:21:22,772 --> 00:21:24,042
He's a lightweight.

493
00:21:24,214 --> 00:21:25,871
Be thankful you have Meredith.

494
00:21:27,191 --> 00:21:28,199
She was fired.

495
00:21:31,459 --> 00:21:32,657
She okay?

496
00:21:34,444 --> 00:21:35,612
I don't know.

497
00:21:36,514 --> 00:21:39,753
Mr. Hoffman? Dr. Shepherd.

498
00:21:39,754 --> 00:21:41,435
You're at Seattle Grace hospital.

499
00:21:41,601 --> 00:21:44,000
There was an accident. A sinkhole collapsed.

500
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,606
My son?

501
00:21:45,642 --> 00:21:46,718
Nicky's on his way in.

502
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:49,466
He's had some severe injuries
that they need me to assess,

503
00:21:49,467 --> 00:21:51,739
but I promise you, I'm gonna
take good care of your son.

504
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:54,844
Nicky Hoffman, sustained crush injuries

505
00:21:54,845 --> 00:21:56,178
and was very unstable in the field.

506
00:21:56,179 --> 00:21:57,398
Robbins is holding a trauma room.

507
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,495
We called Shepherd from the field.

508
00:21:58,496 --> 00:21:59,313
Which one are they in?

509
00:21:59,314 --> 00:22:00,899
Um...

510
00:22:03,594 --> 00:22:04,823
Oh, god. I-I don't... I don't know.

511
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,019
Well, find out.

512
00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:07,747
Well, it's supposed to be on the board.

513
00:22:08,569 --> 00:22:11,763
People, I need you to make sure
you're updating these boards.

514
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,276
April, I need you to reassign these cases.

515
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,844
Uh, Yang, take over Meredith's cases.

516
00:22:19,996 --> 00:22:21,862
- No.
- Cristina.

517
00:22:21,862 --> 00:22:24,324
I'm with Altman, and Meredith
should keep her cases.

518
00:22:24,324 --> 00:22:25,867
I am your chief resident.

519
00:22:25,867 --> 00:22:27,250
You have to do what I say.

520
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,748
April, it's fine.

521
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,786
I can wait. Just sign them
when you have a minute.

522
00:22:34,472 --> 00:22:35,588
You're just gonna give up?

523
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,734
I was fired.

524
00:22:36,734 --> 00:22:38,164
So what are you gonna do about it?

525
00:22:38,164 --> 00:22:39,458
You have to go talk to the board.

526
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,328
The board fired me.

527
00:22:41,814 --> 00:22:42,736
Yang.

528
00:22:44,178 --> 00:22:45,170
What are you doing?

529
00:22:48,172 --> 00:22:49,694
I presented as thirsty,

530
00:22:49,694 --> 00:22:52,515
so... treated the symptoms
with 8 ounces of water.

531
00:22:52,515 --> 00:22:53,779
Now that I'm finished,

532
00:22:53,802 --> 00:22:55,750
I will place this bottle
in the recycling bin

533
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,194
so as to avoid excess strain
on Seattle's landfills.

534
00:23:00,237 --> 00:23:02,980
That's funny. You're a funny girl.

535
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:05,273
Come on. We have patients.

536
00:23:07,394 --> 00:23:09,836
You need a plan. Come up with a plan.

537
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,260
Okay, now pour on that brown soap.

538
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,775
And pick up the thin silver knife.

539
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,176
Good.

540
00:23:40,514 --> 00:23:41,756
Okay, now here's the thing...

541
00:23:41,756 --> 00:23:44,398
you're gonna have to really
put your weight into it.

542
00:23:44,706 --> 00:23:46,363
Try for smooth cuts, okay?

543
00:23:46,363 --> 00:23:47,348
Okay.

544
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:50,651
Now you see that area
just below the tourniquet?

545
00:23:50,906 --> 00:23:52,141
That's where you're gonna cut.

546
00:23:52,141 --> 00:23:55,120
Do it horizontally, as deep as you can.

547
00:24:00,141 --> 00:24:01,527
Are... are you...

548
00:24:01,527 --> 00:24:03,900
are you-are you sure
she's not gonna feel anything?

549
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,191
No, she's unconscious, Danny.
She won't feel a thing.

550
00:24:09,004 --> 00:24:09,966
Okay.

551
00:24:18,945 --> 00:24:20,580
I-I can't.

552
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,526
Danny...

553
00:24:22,355 --> 00:24:23,719
take that blue towel

554
00:24:23,719 --> 00:24:25,676
and cover her face.

555
00:24:25,676 --> 00:24:26,784
It'll help.

556
00:24:47,411 --> 00:24:50,031
All right, now remember to put
your weight behind it, okay?

557
00:24:50,206 --> 00:24:51,192
Here we go.

558
00:24:53,002 --> 00:24:54,218
One...

559
00:24:56,276 --> 00:24:57,468
two...

560
00:24:59,214 --> 00:25:00,302
three.

561
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:02,567
Oh, god!

562
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:05,131
Oh, god!

563
00:25:09,819 --> 00:25:11,249
Ah. I-I hit... I hit bone.

564
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,433
I-I think I hit bone.

565
00:25:12,433 --> 00:25:13,477
That's good. That's good.

566
00:25:13,477 --> 00:25:15,193
Okay, put the scalpel down now.

567
00:25:15,193 --> 00:25:16,369
Now take the curved clamp

568
00:25:16,369 --> 00:25:19,079
and move it back and forth beneath the bone.

569
00:25:25,259 --> 00:25:27,547
Ah. Ugh.

570
00:25:27,954 --> 00:25:30,544
God. God, I-I can't. Uh, it-it won't...

571
00:25:30,544 --> 00:25:32,721
Put your hand in the incision
to get more traction.

572
00:25:36,817 --> 00:25:37,963
I can't.

573
00:25:37,963 --> 00:25:39,467
Danny, I know this is hard,

574
00:25:39,467 --> 00:25:40,894
but we need to create more space

575
00:25:40,894 --> 00:25:42,615
so you'll be able to saw through her bone.

576
00:25:42,615 --> 00:25:44,921
No, I... No, I-I can't.

577
00:25:44,921 --> 00:25:47,291
Okay? This-this is my wife. All right?

578
00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:49,119
I-I-I'm gonna kill her.

579
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:50,535
- She's bleeding now...
- Danny, you can't stop.

580
00:25:50,535 --> 00:25:52,543
No, you need to come down here.
I can't do this.

581
00:25:52,543 --> 00:25:53,913
I won't do this!

582
00:25:53,913 --> 00:25:54,903
I'm going down.

583
00:25:54,903 --> 00:25:56,371
No, Dr. Hunt, I can't let you go down there.

584
00:25:56,371 --> 00:25:58,275
- He can't do it.
- Yes, he can.

585
00:25:58,275 --> 00:26:00,329
He can't. We are asking too much.

586
00:26:00,329 --> 00:26:02,217
- I'm going.
- If it starts to go,

587
00:26:02,217 --> 00:26:04,603
- I'm bringing you...
- I should go. I'm the orthopedic surgeon.

588
00:26:04,603 --> 00:26:06,872
You have a wife and a child.

589
00:26:07,597 --> 00:26:08,739
I'm going.

590
00:26:09,451 --> 00:26:12,379
You're breaking up. Can you repeat that?

591
00:26:19,442 --> 00:26:20,414
What?

592
00:26:20,414 --> 00:26:21,229
I have a plan.

593
00:26:21,229 --> 00:26:22,023
Okay.

594
00:26:22,509 --> 00:26:23,599
I'm gonna be a mom.

595
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:28,609
Okay... Mer, there's a giant sinkhole.

596
00:26:28,609 --> 00:26:29,593
Teddy is all over me.

597
00:26:29,593 --> 00:26:31,521
Don't page me 9-1-1 unless
you have a serious...

598
00:26:31,521 --> 00:26:33,167
This is serious.

599
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,641
Maybe getting fired was a good thing.

600
00:26:36,641 --> 00:26:39,235
What do you cheerful people say
when something crappy happens

601
00:26:39,235 --> 00:26:41,297
and they make it sound
like it wasn't crappy?

602
00:26:41,623 --> 00:26:42,697
A blessing in disguise?

603
00:26:42,697 --> 00:26:44,825
Yeah. Maybe that's what this is.

604
00:26:46,743 --> 00:26:47,739
This is that.

605
00:26:47,761 --> 00:26:48,891
And I can...

606
00:26:49,689 --> 00:26:52,061
make jam and drive car pool

607
00:26:52,061 --> 00:26:53,743
and have playgroups.

608
00:26:53,743 --> 00:26:55,163
And maybe that's enough.

609
00:26:55,411 --> 00:26:57,773
And maybe I'll be a great mom.

610
00:26:58,307 --> 00:27:00,361
Okay. Okay. I'm gonna go vomit.

611
00:27:00,361 --> 00:27:01,925
Uh, call me when Meredith comes back.

612
00:27:01,925 --> 00:27:03,339
And maybe you want to be a mom, too,

613
00:27:03,339 --> 00:27:05,609
and that's why you can't go through with it.

614
00:27:12,029 --> 00:27:13,753
I wish I wanted a kid.

615
00:27:13,753 --> 00:27:15,752
I wish I wanted one so bad,

616
00:27:15,752 --> 00:27:17,326
'cause then this would be easy.

617
00:27:17,326 --> 00:27:18,642
I would be happy.

618
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:21,793
I'd have Owen, and
my life wouldn't be a mess.

619
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:23,055
But I don't.

620
00:27:25,889 --> 00:27:27,109
I don't want a kid.

621
00:27:27,621 --> 00:27:28,743
I mean, I don't want to make jam.

622
00:27:28,743 --> 00:27:30,551
I-I don't want to carpool.

623
00:27:30,551 --> 00:27:32,755
I really, really,
really don't want to be a mother.

624
00:27:32,755 --> 00:27:34,795
I want to be a surgeon, and please...

625
00:27:34,795 --> 00:27:35,879
get it.

626
00:27:36,463 --> 00:27:38,249
I need someone to get it.

627
00:27:38,249 --> 00:27:40,045
And I wish that someone was Owen.

628
00:27:40,045 --> 00:27:42,335
I wish that-that... that at any minute,

629
00:27:42,335 --> 00:27:43,853
he'll get it and show up for me,

630
00:27:43,853 --> 00:27:45,163
but that's not gonna happen.

631
00:27:46,054 --> 00:27:47,355
And you're my person.

632
00:27:48,647 --> 00:27:51,167
I need you to be there at 6:00 tonight

633
00:27:51,167 --> 00:27:52,379
to hold my hand,

634
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:54,505
'cause I am scared, Mer,

635
00:27:55,349 --> 00:27:56,811
and sad,

636
00:27:57,899 --> 00:27:59,807
'cause my husband doesn't get that.

637
00:28:00,249 --> 00:28:01,527
So I need you to.

638
00:28:10,427 --> 00:28:11,777
I am a terrible person.

639
00:28:11,777 --> 00:28:13,267
I know. Awful.

640
00:28:13,871 --> 00:28:14,967
I got Meredith's surgeries.

641
00:28:14,967 --> 00:28:17,393
I'm reaping joy from the fact
that my sister got fired.

642
00:28:17,667 --> 00:28:19,353
A terrible person wouldn't feel terrible

643
00:28:19,353 --> 00:28:20,733
about reaping the joy.

644
00:28:21,017 --> 00:28:23,401
Oh, uh, Jackson, Jackson,

645
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:25,396
- I need you to take over
on a couple of these.
- I can't.

646
00:28:25,396 --> 00:28:27,664
I have to see a man about
redoing some sutures.

647
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:28,581
Please.

648
00:28:32,439 --> 00:28:33,535
I'll take one.

649
00:28:33,535 --> 00:28:34,922
Thank you. Bed 4.

650
00:28:36,409 --> 00:28:38,747
Bailey needs her spleen
patient taken to the O.R.

651
00:28:38,747 --> 00:28:41,295
Uh... he's in bed 3.

652
00:28:41,295 --> 00:28:44,623
So... he just, um, he needs a consent form.

653
00:28:44,623 --> 00:28:46,907
Make sure that the consent
form gets put on his chart.

654
00:28:46,907 --> 00:28:47,861
Uh, right.

655
00:28:55,306 --> 00:28:57,157
Zola, peekaboo.

656
00:28:59,219 --> 00:29:00,251
Peekaboo.

657
00:29:02,332 --> 00:29:03,317
Hi, Janet.

658
00:29:03,317 --> 00:29:04,721
Hey, Meredith.

659
00:29:04,721 --> 00:29:05,887
I'm just finishing up your home study,

660
00:29:05,887 --> 00:29:07,877
and I thought I'd check
and see how Zola's doing.

661
00:29:07,877 --> 00:29:09,507
She is doing great.

662
00:29:09,507 --> 00:29:11,590
I heard about the sinkhole on the radio.

663
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:13,096
I figured you'd be busy today.

664
00:29:13,096 --> 00:29:15,655
Yeah, I'm just, uh, in between surgeries.

665
00:29:15,655 --> 00:29:18,155
So... how are things going?

666
00:29:18,155 --> 00:29:19,837
Is she sleeping through the night?

667
00:29:21,462 --> 00:29:22,829
No, I... not really.

668
00:29:22,829 --> 00:29:25,441
Um, she's up a few times.
But it's fine. I don't mind.

669
00:29:25,441 --> 00:29:27,503
Just you, or are you guys taking turns?

670
00:29:27,598 --> 00:29:30,567
No, he's great with her. He's...
Derek's great with her.

671
00:29:30,567 --> 00:29:32,996
Dr. Grey, are you taking Zola home now?

672
00:29:32,996 --> 00:29:35,366
Because it says here that
Dr. Shepherd's got her tonight.

673
00:29:36,302 --> 00:29:39,115
Wait. I don't understand.
You two aren't together?

674
00:29:39,115 --> 00:29:39,860
No. We are.

675
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:42,213
We take turns dropping her
off and picking her up.

676
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:43,453
I'm not taking her home.

677
00:29:43,453 --> 00:29:46,077
I just came to, uh, to-to say hi.

678
00:29:46,689 --> 00:29:48,879
I actually should get back to work.

679
00:29:49,003 --> 00:29:50,859
Okay, Zola. I'm gonna go.

680
00:29:51,281 --> 00:29:52,347
Okay.

681
00:29:52,669 --> 00:29:53,720
It was nice to see you, Janet.

682
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,940
You, too, Meredith.

683
00:30:01,041 --> 00:30:02,005
How's Nicky doing?

684
00:30:02,377 --> 00:30:04,111
I gotta do my final exploration,

685
00:30:04,111 --> 00:30:06,528
check for any missed bleeders,
and then I'm out.

686
00:30:06,663 --> 00:30:08,353
The kid had a renal artery thrombosis.

687
00:30:08,353 --> 00:30:09,771
I thought his kidney was a goner,

688
00:30:09,771 --> 00:30:12,115
but Alex did an interposition
graft and saved it.

689
00:30:12,115 --> 00:30:13,448
He's doing an amazing job.

690
00:30:13,448 --> 00:30:15,329
I need to stabilize his spinal fracture.

691
00:30:15,329 --> 00:30:16,353
So what do you got,
about another hour or so?

692
00:30:16,353 --> 00:30:18,205
Well, with the rock star over here,
you never know.

693
00:30:18,205 --> 00:30:19,929
I'd keep your pager close by. Mm.

694
00:30:20,523 --> 00:30:22,267
- Dr. Shepherd.
- Mm-hmm.

695
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,581
Janet Meyers with social services

696
00:30:23,581 --> 00:30:25,053
- needs to speak with you.
- Oh, what now?

697
00:30:25,053 --> 00:30:26,351
She's waiting in the lobby.

698
00:30:28,249 --> 00:30:30,277
I heard about Meredith. I'm sorry.

699
00:30:31,307 --> 00:30:33,471
But you know, Meredith's strong,
you're strong.

700
00:30:33,471 --> 00:30:35,055
- You're gonna make it through...
- Could you guys just keep it down?

701
00:30:35,055 --> 00:30:36,600
I'm trying to concentrate. Please.

702
00:30:37,905 --> 00:30:39,558
All right. Just page me
when you're ready, okay?

703
00:30:52,983 --> 00:30:54,085
I'm so... I'm sorry.

704
00:30:54,331 --> 00:30:55,699
- I'm sorry. Oh.
- Danny?

705
00:30:55,699 --> 00:30:56,207
I'm sorry.

706
00:30:56,207 --> 00:30:57,615
Danny, look at me.

707
00:30:57,825 --> 00:30:58,941
You're doing great.

708
00:30:59,937 --> 00:31:00,899
Now I need you...

709
00:31:02,765 --> 00:31:04,443
I need you to cover her head.

710
00:31:05,001 --> 00:31:07,239
Keep her head safe, all right?

711
00:31:11,831 --> 00:31:12,917
All right.

712
00:31:15,613 --> 00:31:17,883
I couldn't do it. I c-I couldn't...

713
00:31:17,883 --> 00:31:19,883
- I couldn't do it. I couldn't.
- Danny, you did it.

714
00:31:20,498 --> 00:31:21,879
You did the hard part.

715
00:31:21,879 --> 00:31:22,797
All right?

716
00:31:23,493 --> 00:31:25,214
Now, Danny...

717
00:31:25,527 --> 00:31:26,685
Danny, look away.

718
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:38,743
All right, she's free. Good job.

719
00:31:39,993 --> 00:31:40,549
I'm gonna finish up,

720
00:31:40,549 --> 00:31:42,031
and we'll both be right behind you.

721
00:31:42,031 --> 00:31:42,779
All right?

722
00:31:46,877 --> 00:31:47,847
Take him up.

723
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:12,646
Meredith, what'd you say to Janet?

724
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:15,151
Nothing. Why?

725
00:32:15,198 --> 00:32:16,767
I just finished answering
a whole slew of questions

726
00:32:16,767 --> 00:32:18,798
about Zola's sleeping arrangements.

727
00:32:18,882 --> 00:32:20,324
She's finishing her home study.

728
00:32:20,324 --> 00:32:22,176
- That's routine.
- Okay, there was nothing routine

729
00:32:22,176 --> 00:32:25,184
when she said that there were
inconsistencies with our stories.

730
00:32:25,454 --> 00:32:26,492
What did she say?

731
00:32:26,492 --> 00:32:27,854
She said that she spoke to you

732
00:32:27,854 --> 00:32:29,566
and that some red flags went up.

733
00:32:30,196 --> 00:32:32,806
Well, I did see her earlier,
but I didn't say anything.

734
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,178
I gotta go. I got a surgery.

735
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:36,646
Well, I'll-I'll talk to Janet and I'll...

736
00:32:36,646 --> 00:32:39,105
No. Don't. Don't do anything.

737
00:32:39,105 --> 00:32:40,349
Don't talk to her. I will talk care of this.

738
00:32:40,349 --> 00:32:42,290
You've already... Don't talk to her.

739
00:32:44,394 --> 00:32:46,398
Dr. Sloan, I think you're
gonna be really impressed

740
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:47,839
by the buried sutures I did here.

741
00:32:48,686 --> 00:32:49,746
After you.

742
00:32:53,398 --> 00:32:55,504
That is impressive. It is.

743
00:32:56,328 --> 00:32:57,834
- Gender reassignment, huh?
- Yeah.

744
00:32:58,812 --> 00:33:00,420
Normally they don't teach
that till next year.

745
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,704
That's a mistake. This is not...

746
00:33:01,704 --> 00:33:03,516
Call me when you find the right patient.

747
00:33:03,722 --> 00:33:05,433
I don't have time for this.

748
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,608
Hey, uh, I need you to prep trauma 1.

749
00:33:07,608 --> 00:33:08,852
We got another sinkhole victim on the way.

750
00:33:08,852 --> 00:33:10,808
Stop asking me to do your work.
Do it yourself.

751
00:33:10,808 --> 00:33:12,608
- And how about you tell me
where Jerry Hoffman is?
- What?

752
00:33:12,608 --> 00:33:13,328
Jerry Hoffman?

753
00:33:13,328 --> 00:33:15,974
Um, uh, well, he's supposed to be in bed 1.

754
00:33:15,974 --> 00:33:17,556
That's what the board says. He's not there?

755
00:33:18,527 --> 00:33:19,712
Does it look like he's there?

756
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:23,044
Oh, wait. Wait. That can't be right,

757
00:33:23,044 --> 00:33:25,097
'cause if the patient
from bed 2 is in bed one,

758
00:33:25,097 --> 00:33:27,205
then that means the patient
from bed 3 must be...

759
00:33:28,516 --> 00:33:29,330
Oh, no.

760
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:31,500
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

761
00:33:32,202 --> 00:33:33,810
The patient is Mr. Chuck Wallace.

762
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:36,560
He's having a splenectomy
secondary to injuries

763
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,953
- sustained in the sinkhole.
- Yes, Dr. Grey,

764
00:33:37,953 --> 00:33:40,446
let's move on before my patient bleeds out.

765
00:33:40,446 --> 00:33:42,035
Okay, I'm almost ready Dr. Bailey.

766
00:33:42,035 --> 00:33:43,114
I just have to have the nurse

767
00:33:43,114 --> 00:33:45,254
show me the consent form
as part of the checklist.

768
00:33:46,086 --> 00:33:47,021
Scalpel.

769
00:33:51,069 --> 00:33:52,432
Wait a second.

770
00:33:52,432 --> 00:33:53,209
Dr. Grey,

771
00:33:53,209 --> 00:33:54,277
- you're sterile. What are you...
- Okay, hold-hold on.

772
00:33:54,277 --> 00:33:55,416
Wait a minute. I'm...

773
00:33:55,416 --> 00:33:58,988
I think that there...
something might be... off.

774
00:33:58,988 --> 00:34:01,254
I'm thinking that maybe this is...

775
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,469
not our patient.

776
00:34:04,707 --> 00:34:06,713
Then whose patient is it?

777
00:34:06,713 --> 00:34:08,361
I don't-I don't... I don't-I don't know.

778
00:34:08,361 --> 00:34:08,923
I just-I...

779
00:34:08,923 --> 00:34:11,918
You don't know? I'm holding
a scalpel in my hand.

780
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:13,772
I think you had better find out.

781
00:34:13,772 --> 00:34:15,360
Stop! Don't cut!

782
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,986
Uh, it's the wrong patient.

783
00:34:17,482 --> 00:34:19,813
That's Mr. Jarvis,
who needs a lung resection,

784
00:34:19,813 --> 00:34:22,247
not Mr. Wallace with a splenic hemorrhage.

785
00:34:22,271 --> 00:34:23,753
I-I'm-I'm sorry.

786
00:34:23,753 --> 00:34:26,620
I-I-I am so, so sorry.

787
00:34:34,348 --> 00:34:35,893
Would you make sure this gets to

788
00:34:35,893 --> 00:34:37,560
the medical staff office, please?

789
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,557
Yes, doctor.

790
00:34:43,144 --> 00:34:44,045
Meredith.

791
00:34:45,121 --> 00:34:46,054
What?

792
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,530
Nothing.

793
00:34:50,061 --> 00:34:52,155
Grey, we've got a guy with
severe crush injuries,

794
00:34:52,155 --> 00:34:54,295
and Callie's come in
with a field amputation.

795
00:34:54,295 --> 00:34:54,822
Let's move.

796
00:34:54,822 --> 00:34:57,538
- We gotta get these trauma rooms ready...
- I got fired. Okay?

797
00:34:57,538 --> 00:34:58,602
I got fired.

798
00:34:59,202 --> 00:35:00,178
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

799
00:35:00,178 --> 00:35:01,585
Yeah, well, now you know.

800
00:35:03,337 --> 00:35:04,649
I have to go. I have a...

801
00:35:05,539 --> 00:35:06,427
Owen.

802
00:35:08,726 --> 00:35:10,138
She didn't have the abortion.

803
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,931
She wants to and she can't
do it because of you,

804
00:35:12,931 --> 00:35:14,053
because she loves you.

805
00:35:14,542 --> 00:35:17,856
And instead of loving her,
you're punishing her.

806
00:35:18,146 --> 00:35:19,132
For what?

807
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,671
For being the woman that
you fell in love with?

808
00:35:21,671 --> 00:35:22,798
- This isn't any of your business.
- Okay,

809
00:35:22,798 --> 00:35:24,829
do you know what will happen to Cristina

810
00:35:24,829 --> 00:35:26,612
if she has a kid that she doesn't want?

811
00:35:26,734 --> 00:35:28,252
It will almost kill her.

812
00:35:29,005 --> 00:35:30,341
Trying to pretend that she loves a kid

813
00:35:30,341 --> 00:35:32,666
as much as she loves surgery
will almost kill her,

814
00:35:32,666 --> 00:35:34,462
and it'll almost kill your kid.

815
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:37,192
Do you know what it's like
to be raised by someone

816
00:35:37,192 --> 00:35:38,250
who didn't want you?

817
00:35:38,522 --> 00:35:39,488
I do.

818
00:35:40,264 --> 00:35:42,470
To know you stood in the way
of your mother's career?

819
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:45,030
I do. I was raised by a Cristina.

820
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,852
My mother was a Cristina.

821
00:35:48,799 --> 00:35:50,304
And as the child she didn't want,

822
00:35:50,304 --> 00:35:52,777
I am telling you, don't do this to her,

823
00:35:53,326 --> 00:35:55,265
because she's kind and she cares

824
00:35:55,265 --> 00:35:56,634
and she won't make it.

825
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:59,082
The guilt of resenting her own kid

826
00:35:59,082 --> 00:36:00,454
will eat her alive.

827
00:36:01,656 --> 00:36:02,718
All right. Coming through.

828
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,259
No one was updating the board
even though I kept telling them to.

829
00:36:14,702 --> 00:36:17,030
I know-I know...
I have to make people listen to me

830
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:20,058
but in all fairness,
I've been chief resident for 12 hours

831
00:36:20,058 --> 00:36:22,429
and... and yes I mean
I could have lost his...

832
00:36:22,429 --> 00:36:24,028
his perfectly good spleen

833
00:36:24,028 --> 00:36:27,727
but he didn't because of
a checklist I implemented.

834
00:36:28,784 --> 00:36:31,697
No, I haven't had excuses
for what happened. I...

835
00:36:33,654 --> 00:36:35,539
It's okay, just yell at me.

836
00:36:36,125 --> 00:36:37,981
- I can take it.
- A...

837
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:40,595
It's-it's okay.

838
00:36:41,509 --> 00:36:42,509
Shh...

839
00:36:47,815 --> 00:36:49,583
No, I-I-I can... I can take it.

840
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:52,089
Really. I-I swear, I can take it. I...

841
00:36:54,142 --> 00:36:55,772
How deep are you placing the tube?

842
00:36:57,581 --> 00:36:58,931
21 centimeters

843
00:36:58,931 --> 00:37:00,411
exactly.

844
00:37:00,993 --> 00:37:02,207
Hallelujah, I'm in.

845
00:37:04,459 --> 00:37:05,323
Great.

846
00:37:05,375 --> 00:37:08,671
Now explain why you chose
that size endotracheal tube.

847
00:37:09,935 --> 00:37:11,796
Because I'm in my fifth year of residency

848
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:14,516
and I know what size tube to
use for a basic intubation.

849
00:37:14,516 --> 00:37:15,969
Why are you treating me like a first year?

850
00:37:15,969 --> 00:37:17,363
Because no one ever did.

851
00:37:18,777 --> 00:37:20,161
I bet your first year,

852
00:37:20,161 --> 00:37:22,791
you could do things better
than most third years.

853
00:37:23,121 --> 00:37:25,243
Well, yes, I could.
Why are you punishing me for it?

854
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,301
I'm happy.

855
00:37:27,089 --> 00:37:28,782
That makes me see you differently.

856
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:31,039
Your arrogance is not your fault.

857
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:33,329
You're arrogant because you're so good.

858
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:36,087
People let you slide by, skip steps.

859
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,239
They gave you the hard stuff

860
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:38,983
But let you skip the easy stuff.

861
00:37:39,503 --> 00:37:40,871
I have no doubt that you can tell me

862
00:37:40,871 --> 00:37:42,849
how to do a coronary artery bypass.

863
00:37:42,849 --> 00:37:44,663
But I'm not sure that you can tell me

864
00:37:45,191 --> 00:37:48,431
why you chose that size endotracheal tube.

865
00:37:55,281 --> 00:37:56,505
Look, I know what you heard,

866
00:37:56,505 --> 00:37:58,515
but Meredith Grey is one
of the most qualified...

867
00:38:00,928 --> 00:38:02,107
Yeah, I understand.

868
00:38:02,951 --> 00:38:04,654
Yeah. Thank you for your time.

869
00:38:07,603 --> 00:38:09,470
Not now, Karev. I'm in no mood.

870
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:11,339
You need to get Meredith her job back.

871
00:38:11,339 --> 00:38:12,471
What do you think I've been doing?

872
00:38:12,471 --> 00:38:14,389
I've spent the whole morning
trying to get her a job.

873
00:38:14,389 --> 00:38:16,025
Meredith doesn't need a job.

874
00:38:16,025 --> 00:38:17,613
- She needs this job.
- It's not gonna happen.

875
00:38:17,613 --> 00:38:18,985
The board's already made their decision.

876
00:38:18,985 --> 00:38:20,109
Let me talk to them.

877
00:38:20,139 --> 00:38:22,125
I mean, maybe I don't know what I saw.

878
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:24,309
Maybe I-I-I-I lied to get

879
00:38:24,309 --> 00:38:25,477
- the chief resident...
- I can't let you say that.

880
00:38:25,477 --> 00:38:26,705
Oh, the hell you can't.

881
00:38:30,916 --> 00:38:32,382
Karev, this is not on you.

882
00:38:35,253 --> 00:38:36,286
Yeah, it is.

883
00:38:37,141 --> 00:38:38,303
It's all on me.

884
00:38:42,109 --> 00:38:43,467
Looks perfect, Jerry.

885
00:38:43,874 --> 00:38:45,441
Second time's the charm.

886
00:38:47,386 --> 00:38:48,823
Sutures look a lot better.

887
00:38:48,985 --> 00:38:49,943
Really?

888
00:38:50,332 --> 00:38:50,849
That's great.

889
00:38:50,849 --> 00:38:53,145
No. No, no. Not great. Better.

890
00:38:53,845 --> 00:38:55,727
Which isn't saying much
considering the crappy job

891
00:38:55,727 --> 00:38:56,973
you did the first time.

892
00:38:56,989 --> 00:38:58,967
You-you just said it
looked a lot better, s...

893
00:38:58,967 --> 00:39:01,351
This guy just fell into a sinkhole,

894
00:39:01,351 --> 00:39:02,875
his kid's in surgery,

895
00:39:03,476 --> 00:39:04,678
and now he's got a scar

896
00:39:04,678 --> 00:39:06,407
to remind him of this terrible day

897
00:39:06,407 --> 00:39:07,892
for the rest of his life.

898
00:39:07,892 --> 00:39:09,393
You want to go tell him that,

899
00:39:09,541 --> 00:39:10,467
big shot?

900
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:12,011
Go ahead.

901
00:39:12,903 --> 00:39:13,973
Dr. Sloan.

902
00:39:15,435 --> 00:39:16,837
Is Nicky out of surgery?

903
00:39:16,971 --> 00:39:19,325
Uh, Dr. Avery was just
about to go check on that.

904
00:39:22,678 --> 00:39:23,729
Um...

905
00:39:28,534 --> 00:39:30,001
Wait. Bailey paged you, too?

906
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:30,901
Any idea why?

907
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:33,137
Who cares? As long as it
gets me away from Altman.

908
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:34,287
Oh, god.

909
00:39:34,621 --> 00:39:36,171
She's gonna fire us, isn't she?

910
00:39:36,171 --> 00:39:37,539
Why would she fire us?

911
00:39:37,539 --> 00:39:39,544
There was that patient mix-up in the O.R.

912
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:41,269
Oh. You should be fired.

913
00:39:41,728 --> 00:39:44,457
Me? You guys didn't update the board.

914
00:39:44,809 --> 00:39:46,851
That's why she looks so pissed off.

915
00:39:50,309 --> 00:39:51,952
That's not good for it.

916
00:39:53,555 --> 00:39:55,115
Uh, let me see that chart.

917
00:39:55,115 --> 00:39:56,648
What is she looking for?

918
00:40:00,756 --> 00:40:01,748
What have you got?

919
00:40:01,849 --> 00:40:04,837
A field amputation with
complicated extrications.

920
00:40:05,175 --> 00:40:06,937
Still assessing her multiple crush injuries,

921
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:08,479
but I felt a broken pelvis for sure,

922
00:40:08,479 --> 00:40:10,252
and her B.P.'s in the toilet.

923
00:40:10,493 --> 00:40:12,367
Yeah, this is a gunther.

924
00:40:13,759 --> 00:40:14,665
Really?

925
00:40:14,665 --> 00:40:15,633
Really.

926
00:40:17,183 --> 00:40:18,518
Do you think they can handle a gunther?

927
00:40:18,817 --> 00:40:21,411
Oh, I think they need a gunther.

928
00:40:21,641 --> 00:40:23,725
Uh, what's a gunther?

929
00:40:28,875 --> 00:40:30,713
Hey. I got your message. What's up?

930
00:40:31,189 --> 00:40:33,413
We should wait till your husband gets here.

931
00:40:34,011 --> 00:40:35,111
You paged Derek?

932
00:40:36,155 --> 00:40:37,582
Well, he's in surgery.
That could take hours.

933
00:40:37,582 --> 00:40:39,441
Can't you at least tell
me what this is about?

934
00:40:41,383 --> 00:40:43,031
I could tell something was up

935
00:40:43,031 --> 00:40:45,047
when I ran into you at Zola's day care

936
00:40:45,047 --> 00:40:47,529
so I made some calls.

937
00:40:49,077 --> 00:40:50,171
It would have been better

938
00:40:50,171 --> 00:40:52,287
if you told me that you had been fired

939
00:40:52,287 --> 00:40:54,329
and that you and
Dr. Shepherd were living apart.

940
00:40:54,329 --> 00:40:56,192
- But I can explain...
- I'm sure you can.

941
00:40:56,511 --> 00:40:58,295
But you understand my concern.

942
00:40:58,579 --> 00:41:01,371
So-so what happens now?
Worst-case scenario.

943
00:41:01,371 --> 00:41:02,957
Let's not even go there.

944
00:41:02,957 --> 00:41:04,899
Well, they couldn't take Zola, right?

945
00:41:05,779 --> 00:41:06,883
I'm not really comfortable

946
00:41:06,883 --> 00:41:08,393
discussing this without your husband.

947
00:41:08,393 --> 00:41:10,491
Well, this is urgent, so I'll go get him

948
00:41:10,491 --> 00:41:11,806
and I will be right back.

949
00:41:15,505 --> 00:41:17,033
Do you have what it takes?

950
00:41:22,799 --> 00:41:25,697
If your marriage is in trouble,
can you weather the storm?

951
00:41:33,879 --> 00:41:35,221
When the ground gives way...

952
00:41:36,064 --> 00:41:37,767
and your world collapses...

953
00:41:39,453 --> 00:41:42,088
He's losing his S.S.E.P.s
push I.V. steroids.

954
00:41:47,823 --> 00:41:49,701
Maybe you just need to have faith...

955
00:41:49,943 --> 00:41:51,403
Scrub in. I need you.

956
00:41:51,547 --> 00:41:52,651
I just got your page.

957
00:41:52,651 --> 00:41:55,187
And trust that you can
survive this together.

958
00:41:56,861 --> 00:41:58,846
Maybe you just need to hold on tight...

959
00:41:58,846 --> 00:42:00,450
Oh, what did I do?

960
00:42:01,463 --> 00:42:02,803
What did I do?

961
00:42:03,024 --> 00:42:04,149
And no matter what...

962
00:42:04,149 --> 00:42:05,621
What did I do?

963
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:08,561
Don't let go.

964
00:42:15,937 --> 00:42:17,845
When my mother left my father,

965
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:20,184
she didn't tell him she was leaving

966
00:42:20,185 --> 00:42:21,172
and taking me with her

967
00:42:21,173 --> 00:42:23,513
until we'd landed on
the other side of the country.

968
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,829
In those days,
it was called family troubles.

969
00:42:28,365 --> 00:42:30,315
Today it'd be called kidnapping.

970
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:32,128
Could you page Dr. Shepherd one more time?

971
00:42:32,129 --> 00:42:33,570
I paged him two minutes ago.

972
00:42:33,711 --> 00:42:36,425
It's really very important that
I speak with him right away.

973
00:42:36,426 --> 00:42:38,140
He's a brain surgeon.
Everyone looking for him

974
00:42:38,141 --> 00:42:39,695
thinks it's really very important.

975
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:42,759
I'll let you know when he calls back.

976
00:42:44,354 --> 00:42:47,513
Sir, you know how I said
I wanted to do a gunther today?

977
00:42:47,634 --> 00:42:50,138
I sent you an e-mail with
my new screening criteria

978
00:42:50,139 --> 00:42:51,216
for my clinical trial.

979
00:42:51,217 --> 00:42:52,294
Did you get a chance to look at it?

980
00:42:52,295 --> 00:42:55,073
Not yet. Uh, Torres has
a patient from the sinkhole.

981
00:42:55,074 --> 00:42:56,432
She would be perfect for...

982
00:42:56,433 --> 00:42:59,004
You know, I'm inserting an islet cell device

983
00:42:59,005 --> 00:42:59,742
this afternoon.

984
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:01,102
I'd like you to be there,
see how it works, okay?

985
00:43:01,103 --> 00:43:02,364
Oh, no. You're gonna do a hundred of 'em.

986
00:43:02,365 --> 00:43:03,936
Can I see the next one?
Today's just not a good day...

987
00:43:03,937 --> 00:43:05,139
I'd like it to happen today.

988
00:43:05,533 --> 00:43:08,185
No, sir. The fifth years are
at each other's throats.

989
00:43:08,186 --> 00:43:09,422
And it's affecting the work.

990
00:43:09,423 --> 00:43:12,132
I almost pulled a spleen out of
a man with a hole in his lung.

991
00:43:12,133 --> 00:43:12,967
I need you in this surgery.

992
00:43:12,968 --> 00:43:14,597
I can't have you supervise a gunther.

993
00:43:14,598 --> 00:43:16,579
Torres can supervise. It's her patient.

994
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:18,776
Who doesn't love a gunther?

995
00:43:20,328 --> 00:43:21,283
Fine. Do a gunther.

996
00:43:21,284 --> 00:43:22,789
But be in my O.R. by 4:00.

997
00:43:23,253 --> 00:43:24,568
4:00. Okay. Come on. Go.

998
00:43:26,631 --> 00:43:27,490
Cristina.

999
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:29,645
What are you doing?

1000
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,041
Oh, Bailey paged 9-1-1.

1001
00:43:31,156 --> 00:43:33,011
Well, what happened to the chest tube?

1002
00:43:33,016 --> 00:43:35,283
An intern's doing it
'cause it's intern's work,

1003
00:43:35,706 --> 00:43:36,685
which I love.

1004
00:43:37,085 --> 00:43:37,803
I'm-I'm loving

1005
00:43:37,804 --> 00:43:39,313
the back-to-the-basics thing.

1006
00:43:39,314 --> 00:43:41,637
It's so valuable, but, uh, 9-1-1, so...

1007
00:43:41,638 --> 00:43:43,137
- Hey.
- Oh, and you have to go.

1008
00:43:43,138 --> 00:43:44,952
So no worries. We'll talk later.

1009
00:43:45,147 --> 00:43:45,764
Um...

1010
00:43:47,624 --> 00:43:49,344
I had such a good attitude today,

1011
00:43:49,345 --> 00:43:51,092
- and now it's gone.
- Dr. Webber called.

1012
00:43:51,093 --> 00:43:52,329
He's gonna put the thing in.

1013
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:53,826
Now?

1014
00:43:53,827 --> 00:43:54,941
At 4:00.

1015
00:43:55,492 --> 00:43:57,709
Wait. They just call... why would he do that?

1016
00:43:57,710 --> 00:43:58,994
I don't know, but I'm not complaining.

1017
00:43:58,995 --> 00:44:00,339
I just want the damn thing over with.

1018
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:03,224
So I'll, uh... I'll call
you when I'm in a room.

1019
00:44:03,527 --> 00:44:04,522
- Okay.
- Okay?

1020
00:44:04,937 --> 00:44:06,216
- Bye.
- Bye.

1021
00:44:10,018 --> 00:44:10,766
You see that?

1022
00:44:10,767 --> 00:44:11,993
I wish I did. I can't see anything.

1023
00:44:11,994 --> 00:44:13,547
Hold the nerve root retractor.

1024
00:44:14,044 --> 00:44:15,523
It's yours again, Dr. Shepherd.

1025
00:44:15,524 --> 00:44:17,391
Why is my pager going off every 30 seconds?

1026
00:44:17,392 --> 00:44:19,761
Gloria's checking on it.
His S.S.E.P.s are coming back up.

1027
00:44:19,762 --> 00:44:21,123
There's still a lot of epidural bleeding.

1028
00:44:23,499 --> 00:44:24,804
Dr. Shepherd, when you have a second.

1029
00:44:24,805 --> 00:44:26,174
Does it look like I have a second?

1030
00:44:26,802 --> 00:44:27,816
What the hell is the problem?

1031
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:29,493
They said it's something about your baby.

1032
00:44:33,614 --> 00:44:35,408
She was pinned under her car,

1033
00:44:35,409 --> 00:44:37,489
her leg was amputated in a pit of dirt,

1034
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:40,861
her abdomen is pulp,
and her pelvis is probably crushed.

1035
00:44:40,862 --> 00:44:42,448
You will work together

1036
00:44:42,449 --> 00:44:44,376
to assess her injuries and repair them.

1037
00:44:44,377 --> 00:44:45,167
Oh, in the O.R.?

1038
00:44:45,168 --> 00:44:47,398
No, at the jiffy lube. Yes, in the O.R.

1039
00:44:47,536 --> 00:44:49,479
Now Dr. Torres will supervise your work.

1040
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,791
If you're killing her, she will step in.

1041
00:44:50,792 --> 00:44:51,982
Otherwise, you're on your own.

1042
00:44:52,174 --> 00:44:53,318
Don't screw this up

1043
00:44:53,319 --> 00:44:55,578
like you screw everything
else up you've touched lately.

1044
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:57,328
Ladies and gentlemen,

1045
00:44:57,858 --> 00:44:59,116
step away from the patient.

1046
00:45:02,387 --> 00:45:04,081
- Is she... is she here?
- She is,

1047
00:45:04,082 --> 00:45:05,418
- and as soon as...
- I want to see her.

1048
00:45:05,419 --> 00:45:07,769
Hey, hang on. We need
to check you out first.

1049
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:09,566
- Does she know about her leg?
- She's unconscious.

1050
00:45:09,567 --> 00:45:11,653
All right? I'll go and see
how she's doing, okay?

1051
00:45:12,069 --> 00:45:13,664
Hey, lie down.

1052
00:45:14,466 --> 00:45:15,944
I will see how she is doing.

1053
00:45:16,402 --> 00:45:18,237
I'm gonna get someone to take you to C.T.

1054
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:20,379
and then I will come
back with a full report.

1055
00:45:20,582 --> 00:45:21,436
Okay?

1056
00:45:21,437 --> 00:45:22,425
Okay.

1057
00:45:23,719 --> 00:45:24,532
All right.

1058
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:26,900
It's an open book pelvic fracture.

1059
00:45:26,901 --> 00:45:28,213
And a comminuted femur fracture.

1060
00:45:28,214 --> 00:45:29,876
Has anyone fully examined the stump?

1061
00:45:29,877 --> 00:45:32,752
Pneumopericardium and
an enlarged cardiac shadow.

1062
00:45:32,753 --> 00:45:35,149
She needs a chest tube and a C.T.

1063
00:45:35,395 --> 00:45:36,816
Free fluid. She needs the O.R.

1064
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:38,024
An embolization and angio

1065
00:45:38,025 --> 00:45:39,625
would help stabilize the pelvic bleeding.

1066
00:45:39,626 --> 00:45:41,355
- An angio's just gonna waste time.
- We could pack her in the O.R.

1067
00:45:41,356 --> 00:45:42,441
Call the O.R. Tell them to

1068
00:45:42,442 --> 00:45:44,078
- prep for an emergent laparotomy.
- Hello? A C.T.

1069
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:44,725
Excuse me.

1070
00:45:44,726 --> 00:45:45,899
- I'm telling you guys...
- Oh, no, no.

1071
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:47,858
- Something is going on with her heart.
- What do you mean, no?

1072
00:45:47,859 --> 00:45:48,744
That's my patient.

1073
00:45:48,745 --> 00:45:50,551
- We're doing a gunther.
- What the hell's a gunther?

1074
00:45:50,552 --> 00:45:52,364
It's, uh, like a team-building exercise.

1075
00:45:52,365 --> 00:45:53,766
See, the hospital does it when the residents

1076
00:45:53,767 --> 00:45:55,304
aren't working well together.

1077
00:45:55,305 --> 00:45:56,238
It seems to help.

1078
00:45:56,322 --> 00:45:58,035
If the patient doesn't die.
One time, the patient died,

1079
00:45:58,036 --> 00:45:59,143
and then it didn't help at all.

1080
00:45:59,346 --> 00:46:01,681
Oh. Um, so what, they,
uh, prep her and then...

1081
00:46:01,682 --> 00:46:03,452
Uh, no, no, no. No attendings.
Just the bunnies.

1082
00:46:03,866 --> 00:46:04,790
In the O.R.?

1083
00:46:04,791 --> 00:46:06,950
Yes, the O.R. Why does no
one seem to get that part?

1084
00:46:06,951 --> 00:46:08,727
No, no. Not this patient.

1085
00:46:08,728 --> 00:46:10,385
I just pulled her out
of a hole in the ground

1086
00:46:10,386 --> 00:46:11,703
that almost ate her alive,

1087
00:46:11,704 --> 00:46:14,136
and her husband had to cut off her leg.

1088
00:46:14,137 --> 00:46:16,352
- Dr. Torres will be there every
step of the way.
- Bailey...

1089
00:46:16,353 --> 00:46:17,923
- They can handle this.
- I said no.

1090
00:46:17,924 --> 00:46:20,725
Unh. The chief said yes.

1091
00:46:21,098 --> 00:46:21,975
I'm sorry.

1092
00:46:21,976 --> 00:46:23,133
Oh, yeah? Who died and made you god?

1093
00:46:23,221 --> 00:46:25,259
Okay, look, I think what we need to do is,

1094
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:26,339
we just need to take a moment...

1095
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:28,050
April, you're chief resident
not chief of surgery.

1096
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:29,194
Did somebody call the O.R.?

1097
00:46:29,195 --> 00:46:31,695
No, because she needs a C.T.
to assess her cardiac injuries.

1098
00:46:31,696 --> 00:46:33,882
- What did I say about...
- No one gives a crap what you have to say.

1099
00:46:37,748 --> 00:46:39,278
Still want to take her to radiology?

1100
00:46:39,279 --> 00:46:41,339
Maybe wait in line for a little
while till the machine's free?

1101
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,521
Is somebody gonna call the O.R.?

1102
00:46:44,841 --> 00:46:46,181
They're still finding their groove.

1103
00:46:46,182 --> 00:46:47,079
Mm.

1104
00:46:47,205 --> 00:46:48,878
You've reached Dr. Meredith Grey. I can't...

1105
00:46:48,879 --> 00:46:50,967
Let's check the liver first.
It's the most likely source.

1106
00:46:50,968 --> 00:46:51,850
What? No.

1107
00:46:51,851 --> 00:46:53,472
- Hey, Yang. Where's Meredith?
- I don't know.

1108
00:46:53,473 --> 00:46:55,270
She's in cardiogenic shock.
That's our main concern.

1109
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:56,649
- Yang...
- They-they fired her.

1110
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:58,491
Maybe she's putting
anthrax in Karev's locker.

1111
00:46:58,492 --> 00:46:59,726
B.P.'s tanking. We need to up her fluids.

1112
00:46:59,727 --> 00:47:01,208
No. Her pericardium is
filled with air and blood.

1113
00:47:01,209 --> 00:47:03,306
- Do you listen to anyone else, ever?
- All the time. Just not you.

1114
00:47:03,307 --> 00:47:04,020
- Or me, apparently.
- Look,

1115
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:05,670
she's not answering her phone or her pager.

1116
00:47:05,671 --> 00:47:07,534
I haven't seen her. I was in the pit.
She's not in the pit.

1117
00:47:07,535 --> 00:47:09,232
I was in the elevator.
She's not in the elevator.

1118
00:47:10,112 --> 00:47:10,947
Page Dr. Grey.

1119
00:47:10,948 --> 00:47:12,339
I just did, sir. She didn't answer...

1120
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:13,405
Page her again.

1121
00:47:18,027 --> 00:47:18,721
Chief.

1122
00:47:18,842 --> 00:47:20,364
Henry just told me that you called him in

1123
00:47:20,365 --> 00:47:21,733
to insert the device today.

1124
00:47:21,734 --> 00:47:22,798
Yeah. I had an opening.

1125
00:47:23,183 --> 00:47:25,257
Well, but he hasn't had his pre-op labs

1126
00:47:25,258 --> 00:47:26,003
and he hasn't had...

1127
00:47:26,004 --> 00:47:27,777
Well, we can rush the labs. It'll be fine.

1128
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:28,885
Well, but he could come in in a week.

1129
00:47:28,886 --> 00:47:30,543
I mean, it just seems a little
weird to race him in here...

1130
00:47:30,544 --> 00:47:33,562
Look, it is a simple procedure.
It'll be over in an hour.

1131
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:34,735
Don't worry about it.

1132
00:47:37,462 --> 00:47:38,282
Dr. Bailey.

1133
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:40,934
I wanted to keep an eye on the gunther.

1134
00:47:40,935 --> 00:47:42,654
An intern just pulled me o...

1135
00:47:42,655 --> 00:47:43,660
I need you now.

1136
00:47:49,769 --> 00:47:52,514
You need to spend some time with the mice.

1137
00:47:53,598 --> 00:47:55,320
This is why I left my gunther?

1138
00:47:56,276 --> 00:47:58,685
Once you put a couple of devices in mice,

1139
00:47:58,686 --> 00:48:00,523
putting one in a human's a breeze...

1140
00:48:00,907 --> 00:48:02,067
All that space.

1141
00:48:03,121 --> 00:48:03,865
Sir,

1142
00:48:04,053 --> 00:48:05,832
I have a full schedule

1143
00:48:05,833 --> 00:48:07,366
that I already had to take apart

1144
00:48:07,367 --> 00:48:09,379
so I could watch you put
this thing in a person

1145
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:10,387
this afternoon.

1146
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:11,613
Henry... Altman's husband.

1147
00:48:11,614 --> 00:48:13,621
I would like to keep an eye on the gunther...

1148
00:48:13,622 --> 00:48:14,973
Put on a mask, Dr. Bailey.

1149
00:48:14,974 --> 00:48:16,952
Even with mice, you need a sterile field.

1150
00:48:21,582 --> 00:48:22,358
This...

1151
00:48:22,994 --> 00:48:25,771
is mouse T.

1152
00:48:26,419 --> 00:48:27,375
He's skinny.

1153
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:29,136
So it won't be easy.

1154
00:48:32,905 --> 00:48:34,387
Get yourself some gloves.

1155
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:39,010
Danny, you have a little
bit of blood in your brain,

1156
00:48:39,011 --> 00:48:40,245
so I'm gonna have one of my colleagues

1157
00:48:40,246 --> 00:48:41,175
take a look at your films.

1158
00:48:41,176 --> 00:48:42,068
Is it bad?

1159
00:48:42,069 --> 00:48:43,058
It's probably nothing,

1160
00:48:43,059 --> 00:48:44,867
but I just don't want to take any chances.

1161
00:48:45,091 --> 00:48:46,057
Did Susannah wake up?

1162
00:48:46,058 --> 00:48:48,214
They're starting her surgery now.

1163
00:48:48,473 --> 00:48:51,048
And she does have some internal bleeding

1164
00:48:51,092 --> 00:48:52,094
that they need to repair.

1165
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:53,051
Well, and wh-when will y...

1166
00:48:53,052 --> 00:48:54,573
when will you tell her about her leg,

1167
00:48:54,574 --> 00:48:55,584
after the surgery?

1168
00:48:55,585 --> 00:48:57,717
We'll just see how it goes, all right?

1169
00:48:57,718 --> 00:48:59,821
But-but... I-I... will she be able to feel it?

1170
00:48:59,822 --> 00:49:01,227
- I mean, what if... what if she sees it...
- Danny...

1171
00:49:01,228 --> 00:49:02,461
And nobody's told her?

1172
00:49:02,462 --> 00:49:04,288
Her leg is not the big
problem right now, okay?

1173
00:49:04,289 --> 00:49:05,866
She just needs to get through the surgery.

1174
00:49:05,896 --> 00:49:07,008
But she has...

1175
00:49:07,189 --> 00:49:09,201
an incredible team working on her.

1176
00:49:09,202 --> 00:49:11,588
Really, they're... unbelievable.

1177
00:49:11,606 --> 00:49:12,698
Give me a 10-blade, please.

1178
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:13,628
Don't give her a 10-blade.

1179
00:49:13,629 --> 00:49:15,076
The woman just had her leg hacked off.

1180
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:16,429
She doesn't need her chest cracked open

1181
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:17,855
for something we're not even sure she has.

1182
00:49:17,856 --> 00:49:19,942
Yeah, well, I'm sure,
and if her heart craps out,

1183
00:49:19,943 --> 00:49:21,858
she's not gonna give a rat's
ass about her leg.

1184
00:49:21,859 --> 00:49:24,340
 Look, we know that she is bleeding
from her pelvis and her abdomen,

1185
00:49:24,341 --> 00:49:25,995
which gives her plenty of
reason to be hypotensive...

1186
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:28,298
- Let's just do an X-lap and see
what we're dealing with.
- No!

1187
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:29,301
- Karev, start the incision.
- Oh.

1188
00:49:29,302 --> 00:49:32,139
W-why him? Just because you're
pissed that I'm chief resident

1189
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:33,514
doesn't mean that you can
pretend I'm not here.

1190
00:49:33,515 --> 00:49:34,925
Nobody cares that you're chief resident.

1191
00:49:34,926 --> 00:49:36,416
Can everyone just shut up, please?

1192
00:49:36,417 --> 00:49:37,839
We are wasting time arguing.

1193
00:49:38,108 --> 00:49:40,825
The only logical conclusion is,
take care of the heart first.

1194
00:49:40,826 --> 00:49:42,048
Hey, is the E.R. still a zoo?

1195
00:49:42,049 --> 00:49:45,591
No, they got everyone who survived
out of the hole a while ago.

1196
00:49:45,856 --> 00:49:47,667
- It's quieted down.
- I'm right.

1197
00:49:48,012 --> 00:49:49,956
The changes were subtle on the X-ray,

1198
00:49:49,957 --> 00:49:51,087
she got the crossword down there?

1199
00:49:51,104 --> 00:49:53,189
Sudoku. You ever try it?

1200
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:55,097
- Bores the crap outta me.
- Amen.

1201
00:49:55,299 --> 00:49:56,407
A major potential source of bleeding.

1202
00:49:56,408 --> 00:49:57,509
You're outvoted, Yang.

1203
00:49:57,510 --> 00:49:58,775
Who do you think the gunther is?

1204
00:49:58,776 --> 00:50:01,103
- This is not a democracy. This is surgery.
- What do you mean?

1205
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:02,583
Is this your first one?

1206
00:50:02,584 --> 00:50:03,491
Yeah, and there are certain rules to follow...

1207
00:50:03,492 --> 00:50:06,672
Hmm. The name gunther comes from
the doctor, not the patient.

1208
00:50:06,673 --> 00:50:08,295
One of the residents always kind of emerges

1209
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:09,459
as a leader when they do this.

1210
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:12,198
And the first time, it was
this little quiet guy named Gunther,

1211
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:13,791
and everyone thought he was
gonna flame out of the program,

1212
00:50:13,792 --> 00:50:15,576
- but it turns out, he's the alpha dog.
- Great.

1213
00:50:15,577 --> 00:50:17,338
Airway and breathing are taken care of...

1214
00:50:17,339 --> 00:50:18,589
We know it won't be Avery.
He doesn't have any balls.

1215
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:20,488
Well, Karev's got the balls,
but everyone hates him.

1216
00:50:20,489 --> 00:50:21,112
So I don't really see
them following his lead.

1217
00:50:21,113 --> 00:50:22,011
You know what? I'm not...

1218
00:50:22,012 --> 00:50:23,430
Bound to be Yang.

1219
00:50:23,618 --> 00:50:26,249
I don't know. Kepner's kind
of a dark horse these days.

1220
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:27,861
Your anatomy book a good read,

1221
00:50:27,862 --> 00:50:29,053
you'll realize that the heart...

1222
00:50:29,054 --> 00:50:30,971
You feel good about that position?

1223
00:50:31,525 --> 00:50:32,533
- It's the main pump.
- Huh?

1224
00:50:32,534 --> 00:50:34,625
- It goes, everything goes.
- You willing to back that up?

1225
00:50:34,626 --> 00:50:35,987
Tell us what you think
is wrong with her heart.

1226
00:50:35,988 --> 00:50:38,018
- What, like, 50 bucks?
- Finally.

1227
00:50:38,362 --> 00:50:39,773
I think she has a tear in her pericardium.

1228
00:50:39,774 --> 00:50:41,055
- You think she has a cardiac tamponade?
- Bring it.

1229
00:50:41,056 --> 00:50:42,295
She doesn't even have any...
but she's hypotensive.

1230
00:50:42,296 --> 00:50:43,470
We got a plenty of other reasons

1231
00:50:43,471 --> 00:50:44,694
for the hypotension.

1232
00:50:44,869 --> 00:50:46,384
How are they doing?

1233
00:50:46,385 --> 00:50:48,117
Still trying to agree where to start.

1234
00:50:49,115 --> 00:50:51,717
I just had to put an islet cell device...

1235
00:50:51,969 --> 00:50:52,987
in a mouse.

1236
00:50:53,273 --> 00:50:55,624
Do you know how small a mouse's omentum is?

1237
00:50:55,625 --> 00:50:57,962
I'm gonna go with really small.

1238
00:50:58,012 --> 00:50:59,254
Strongly consider a thoracotomy.

1239
00:50:59,255 --> 00:51:00,609
Up the dopamine to 15.

1240
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:01,830
Happy now. She's bottoming out.

1241
00:51:01,831 --> 00:51:03,291
Well, if we'd get in there
and pack the pelvis,

1242
00:51:03,292 --> 00:51:04,392
that alone will help
the blood pressure, right?

1243
00:51:04,393 --> 00:51:05,291
Well, yeah, I hope so

1244
00:51:05,292 --> 00:51:06,902
'cause her systolic's down to 68.

1245
00:51:06,903 --> 00:51:08,065
Because her heart is exploding.

1246
00:51:08,066 --> 00:51:10,162
- Okay...
- Is this where I step in?

1247
00:51:10,163 --> 00:51:11,392
We need to stabilize the internal bleeding

1248
00:51:11,393 --> 00:51:13,959
- and then we can get a T.E.E.
while we're in there...
- Yang!

1249
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:15,612
- What are you doing?
- Opening her chest. What does it look like?

1250
00:51:15,613 --> 00:51:16,430
Rib spreader.

1251
00:51:16,431 --> 00:51:18,636
Oh, my god.

1252
00:51:22,721 --> 00:51:25,649
We'll have these lab results
back in a few minutes,

1253
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:27,330
then you'll get a happy cocktail,

1254
00:51:27,331 --> 00:51:28,686
and they'll take you up to the O.R.

1255
00:51:28,687 --> 00:51:31,034
- I mean, his glucose levels
aren't spiking or anything?
- No.

1256
00:51:31,035 --> 00:51:32,888
I mean, nothing that would
make you want to push this up?

1257
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:34,022
Nothing. We got an opening.

1258
00:51:34,023 --> 00:51:34,874
- Opening, right.
- Yes.

1259
00:51:34,875 --> 00:51:35,788
Okay.

1260
00:51:37,328 --> 00:51:38,248
Are you nervous?

1261
00:51:39,318 --> 00:51:40,151
No.

1262
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:42,201
She's nervous. It's kinda cute.

1263
00:51:42,202 --> 00:51:43,051
All right. I'm...

1264
00:51:43,052 --> 00:51:44,178
I'm-I'm gonna go.

1265
00:51:51,345 --> 00:51:52,672
I love you so much.

1266
00:51:53,408 --> 00:51:55,776
And you have made me...

1267
00:51:55,898 --> 00:51:56,887
so happy.

1268
00:51:56,888 --> 00:51:58,063
I mean, like...

1269
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:01,423
like really, really happy

1270
00:52:01,424 --> 00:52:03,662
for the first time in my life, I think.

1271
00:52:06,091 --> 00:52:07,319
Are you saying good-bye?

1272
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,449
No. No. No.

1273
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:11,954
'Cause you-you keep telling me,
this is a simple procedure.

1274
00:52:11,955 --> 00:52:12,991
It is. It is.

1275
00:52:12,992 --> 00:52:14,524
It-it's... it'll, um...

1276
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:16,272
It'll-it'll... it'll be fine.

1277
00:52:16,344 --> 00:52:17,256
Yeah, but that sounded like,

1278
00:52:17,257 --> 00:52:20,282
"and if I never see you again,
remember I love you."

1279
00:52:20,308 --> 00:52:21,309
It did.

1280
00:52:24,205 --> 00:52:25,243
I should go.

1281
00:52:25,323 --> 00:52:26,367
I think it's a good idea.

1282
00:52:27,745 --> 00:52:28,702
It's a rim subdural.

1283
00:52:28,788 --> 00:52:30,129
It'll probably reabsorb.

1284
00:52:30,278 --> 00:52:31,906
I'm not that concerned.
You should keep an eye on it.

1285
00:52:32,212 --> 00:52:32,956
Good.

1286
00:52:34,939 --> 00:52:35,718
Everything all right?

1287
00:52:35,906 --> 00:52:37,791
Uh, Meredith disappeared with Zola.

1288
00:52:38,379 --> 00:52:39,866
Wh-what do you mean, she disappeared?

1289
00:52:41,394 --> 00:52:43,558
She... had a rough day.

1290
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:44,873
She probably just went out for a walk.

1291
00:52:45,702 --> 00:52:48,304
Derek, there are a hundred
possible explanations.

1292
00:52:48,305 --> 00:52:49,496
Don't assume the worst.

1293
00:52:49,497 --> 00:52:50,602
You know why I do that?

1294
00:52:50,957 --> 00:52:51,730
Because lately,

1295
00:52:51,731 --> 00:52:53,831
the level of insanity in my wife's behavior

1296
00:52:53,832 --> 00:52:55,208
defies imagination.

1297
00:52:55,266 --> 00:52:57,368
I know, but sometimes... even with Cristina...

1298
00:52:57,369 --> 00:52:59,000
sometimes, they surprise us.

1299
00:53:02,334 --> 00:53:04,136
Got some bleeding in
the upper right quadrant.

1300
00:53:04,137 --> 00:53:05,861
Give me more suction and lap pads.

1301
00:53:06,188 --> 00:53:08,034
Do you see any bile or
pancreatic secretions?

1302
00:53:08,235 --> 00:53:09,202
- None here.
- Negative.

1303
00:53:09,203 --> 00:53:11,479
Hey, I'm watching Henry's surgery today.

1304
00:53:11,846 --> 00:53:12,716
- We should set up for autotransfusion.
- Why?

1305
00:53:13,175 --> 00:53:15,751
'Cause the chief loves an audience.

1306
00:53:15,752 --> 00:53:17,733
Not because he's worried
that something's wrong

1307
00:53:17,734 --> 00:53:18,985
and he-he wants you there to help?

1308
00:53:19,544 --> 00:53:20,819
- I don't think so.
- What are you doing about it?

1309
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:22,821
Have his accu-cheks been bad?

1310
00:53:22,822 --> 00:53:24,788
No, but he wasn't supposed to be in surgery

1311
00:53:24,789 --> 00:53:25,924
for another two weeks...

1312
00:53:25,925 --> 00:53:27,909
And then this morning, he calls Henry up

1313
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:29,510
and has him race into the hospital...

1314
00:53:29,511 --> 00:53:31,332
He's getting batty in his old age.

1315
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:32,388
Oh, well, that's great,

1316
00:53:32,389 --> 00:53:33,862
'cause he's cutting open my husband today.

1317
00:53:33,863 --> 00:53:36,936
I'll be standing there,
contemplating my mortality.

1318
00:53:36,937 --> 00:53:39,389
If the batty acts up, I'll lend a hand.

1319
00:53:39,759 --> 00:53:40,704
Did you check the duodenum?

1320
00:53:40,705 --> 00:53:41,974
Something is not right.

1321
00:53:42,833 --> 00:53:44,561
You can detach the omentum
from the anterior...

1322
00:53:44,562 --> 00:53:45,373
You know what you sound like?

1323
00:53:45,374 --> 00:53:46,876
- To get a better look.
- I'm aware of that.

1324
00:53:46,966 --> 00:53:48,181
- Metz.
- A wife.

1325
00:53:48,182 --> 00:53:50,114
Cardiac rupture, like I said.

1326
00:53:50,115 --> 00:53:51,692
A lot of bleeding down here.

1327
00:53:51,693 --> 00:53:53,355
Jackson, uh, help her hold pressure there.

1328
00:53:53,356 --> 00:53:54,676
Lap pads down in there, please.

1329
00:53:54,742 --> 00:53:56,468
- Looks like Yang's the gunther.
- Did you get it?

1330
00:53:56,469 --> 00:53:58,231
Yep. No surprise.

1331
00:53:58,232 --> 00:53:59,057
What does that mean?

1332
00:53:59,058 --> 00:54:01,083
It means she took over while everyone else

1333
00:54:01,084 --> 00:54:02,919
is standing around looking like idiots

1334
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:04,431
doing whatever she says.

1335
00:54:04,432 --> 00:54:05,178
Can you suture it?

1336
00:54:05,179 --> 00:54:06,982
I mean, look at Avery. Useless.

1337
00:54:06,983 --> 00:54:09,112
I gotta go. Kepner.

1338
00:54:09,635 --> 00:54:10,569
What was I thinking?

1339
00:54:10,570 --> 00:54:11,976
More lap pads over here.

1340
00:54:12,305 --> 00:54:15,179
Oh, no. No, no. This is the opposite...

1341
00:54:15,426 --> 00:54:17,494
- of what she should be doing.
- I need a clamp in here. I got a bleeder.

1342
00:54:17,494 --> 00:54:18,077
I'm trying to teach her some humility,

1343
00:54:18,078 --> 00:54:19,803
and she's running
the O.R. on a massive trauma.

1344
00:54:19,804 --> 00:54:20,750
What can you do?

1345
00:54:20,751 --> 00:54:23,373
Some people are racehorses.
She's a racehorse.

1346
00:54:23,971 --> 00:54:24,689
V-fib.

1347
00:54:25,526 --> 00:54:26,321
I need the paddles.

1348
00:54:27,743 --> 00:54:28,722
Charge to 20.

1349
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,305
Clear.

1350
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:33,839
No change.

1351
00:54:34,431 --> 00:54:36,333
Okay, I need 1 of intracardiac epi.

1352
00:54:36,334 --> 00:54:37,650
- Someone take over massaging the heart.
- I got it.

1353
00:54:39,964 --> 00:54:41,350
Ow! Oh, my god.

1354
00:54:41,641 --> 00:54:42,479
Ah.

1355
00:54:43,414 --> 00:54:45,109
Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Alex?

1356
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:47,477
Look at me.

1357
00:54:49,271 --> 00:54:50,675
Alex, look at me. Alex?

1358
00:54:52,588 --> 00:54:53,957
- Oh, my god, Alex!
- What the...

1359
00:54:54,176 --> 00:54:55,033
Alex!

1360
00:54:56,601 --> 00:54:58,789
- Racehorse?
- My bad.

1361
00:54:59,383 --> 00:55:01,268
What the... what the hell just happened?

1362
00:55:02,678 --> 00:55:04,035
Epi. Give me another epi.

1363
00:55:04,568 --> 00:55:06,427
- Here you go, doctor.
- I can't find a pulse.

1364
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:07,577
Why the hell doesn't he have a pulse?

1365
00:55:07,578 --> 00:55:08,505
I need a crash cart.

1366
00:55:08,506 --> 00:55:10,084
An epi doesn't stop
a healthy person's heart.

1367
00:55:10,085 --> 00:55:11,815
- What did you do?
- I don't know.

1368
00:55:11,816 --> 00:55:13,739
All right. Her heart's back.
I'm gonna deal with the pericardium.

1369
00:55:13,847 --> 00:55:15,138
Forget about the pelvis for now.
She's bleeding

1370
00:55:15,139 --> 00:55:16,425
through the packing in
the right upper quadrant.

1371
00:55:16,426 --> 00:55:19,074
- Should I repack it?
- Try a pringle maneuver. Graft, please.

1372
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:21,622
Hey, uh, get me and
Dr. Altman gowned and gloved,

1373
00:55:21,623 --> 00:55:22,575
and I need something to stand on.

1374
00:55:22,576 --> 00:55:24,298
Dr. Bailey, it's under control, okay?

1375
00:55:24,299 --> 00:55:25,815
We got a lot of hands in here,
and two more surgeons

1376
00:55:25,816 --> 00:55:26,946
are only gonna confuse matters.

1377
00:55:26,947 --> 00:55:28,590
I'm gonna ask you to step back, please.

1378
00:55:28,634 --> 00:55:30,894
Can I get another pledgeted
3-0 prolene? Suction.

1379
00:55:31,471 --> 00:55:33,042
- V-fib.
- Charging to 200.

1380
00:55:33,102 --> 00:55:34,200
Clear.

1381
00:55:36,824 --> 00:55:37,490
Alex?

1382
00:55:37,491 --> 00:55:39,397
Alex? Alex, can you hear me? Alex?

1383
00:55:39,726 --> 00:55:41,220
You crazy bitch.

1384
00:55:41,221 --> 00:55:42,741
You almost killed me.

1385
00:55:42,987 --> 00:55:43,861
Oh.

1386
00:55:44,051 --> 00:55:45,775
I called home. I scoured the hospital.

1387
00:55:46,455 --> 00:55:49,474
I even had an intern call
every E.R. in the city

1388
00:55:49,475 --> 00:55:51,202
to make sure she wasn't run over by a bus.

1389
00:55:51,203 --> 00:55:52,624
There's no simple explanation.

1390
00:55:53,175 --> 00:55:55,607
Uh, why don't you let me
handle talking to Nicky's dad?

1391
00:55:55,608 --> 00:55:56,860
- I don't mind.
- I'm fine.

1392
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:02,699
How is he?

1393
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:04,681
There were three fractures in Nicky's spine.

1394
00:56:04,682 --> 00:56:05,965
We repaired the damage.

1395
00:56:06,339 --> 00:56:08,585
Looks like, neurologically, he's intact.

1396
00:56:08,586 --> 00:56:10,155
This is the "wait and see" part.

1397
00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:11,901
Can I see him?

1398
00:56:12,081 --> 00:56:13,262
He's in recovery right now.

1399
00:56:13,263 --> 00:56:14,445
They're not gonna let you see him.

1400
00:56:16,505 --> 00:56:18,444
I can't believe that this is happening.

1401
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:22,377
We were just walking down the street,

1402
00:56:22,378 --> 00:56:25,325
talking about why...
people don't have gills.

1403
00:56:26,749 --> 00:56:27,891
I was holding his hand,

1404
00:56:27,892 --> 00:56:29,082
and he just...

1405
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,382
slipped away.

1406
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:36,359
How do you go through the day
when one minute to the next,

1407
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:37,827
your child could just...

1408
00:56:38,369 --> 00:56:39,324
Excuse me.

1409
00:56:44,624 --> 00:56:45,420
I'm sorry.

1410
00:56:45,835 --> 00:56:46,664
He's...

1411
00:56:48,861 --> 00:56:49,931
Let's go find Nicky.

1412
00:56:50,135 --> 00:56:51,928
I thought you said,
they weren't gonna let me see him.

1413
00:56:51,929 --> 00:56:53,347
Well, we're gonna figure something out.

1414
00:56:53,348 --> 00:56:54,584
You need to see your son.

1415
00:56:54,877 --> 00:56:55,977
Don't touch me.

1416
00:56:55,978 --> 00:56:56,814
I'm not touching you.

1417
00:56:56,815 --> 00:56:57,934
Don't touch my gurney!

1418
00:56:58,223 --> 00:57:00,180
All right, get this artery. See right there?

1419
00:57:00,181 --> 00:57:00,915
Yeah.

1420
00:57:00,916 --> 00:57:03,420
Good. Now do a tie on the hemostat.

1421
00:57:03,589 --> 00:57:04,706
Who'd have thunk it?

1422
00:57:04,707 --> 00:57:06,159
Avery's the gunther.

1423
00:57:06,567 --> 00:57:07,557
What the hell happened?

1424
00:57:07,744 --> 00:57:10,168
Yang almost killed Karev,
and Avery's the gunther.

1425
00:57:10,169 --> 00:57:11,132
- Avery?
- Mm-hmm.

1426
00:57:11,133 --> 00:57:12,904
- Get outta here.
- Hand to god.

1427
00:57:12,905 --> 00:57:13,725
Avery...

1428
00:57:14,584 --> 00:57:16,025
Good job, son.

1429
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:17,508
Thank you.

1430
00:57:17,509 --> 00:57:19,026
I'm right here if you need anything.

1431
00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:21,258
Oh, damn it.

1432
00:57:22,044 --> 00:57:23,171
My guy won.

1433
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,066
We're gonna be great together.

1434
00:57:34,776 --> 00:57:35,664
Sorry.

1435
00:57:35,873 --> 00:57:38,277
A little hiccup in the gunther.

1436
00:57:38,278 --> 00:57:39,489
Well, take your time.

1437
00:57:40,572 --> 00:57:43,756
You know, I've seen you
open an abdomen before.

1438
00:57:43,757 --> 00:57:44,951
Whereas Dr. Grey...

1439
00:57:44,952 --> 00:57:46,902
I don't want an observer. I want an assist.

1440
00:57:47,133 --> 00:57:48,444
Oh, okay. Is something wrong?

1441
00:57:48,445 --> 00:57:49,795
No, this is a teaching hospital.

1442
00:57:49,796 --> 00:57:51,202
And you're not too old to learn.

1443
00:57:51,639 --> 00:57:53,548
Yeah, but it'd be good
experience for Grey to see...

1444
00:57:53,549 --> 00:57:55,532
Dr. Bailey, if I wanted a resident's help,

1445
00:57:55,533 --> 00:57:56,605
I'd ask for it.

1446
00:57:58,761 --> 00:57:59,470
Here you go, doctor.

1447
00:57:59,471 --> 00:58:00,369
Thank you.

1448
00:58:04,281 --> 00:58:05,455
Whenever you're ready.

1449
00:58:06,862 --> 00:58:08,977
All right, then get back to me
with her post-op crit.

1450
00:58:09,031 --> 00:58:09,952
And make sure you're aggressive

1451
00:58:09,953 --> 00:58:11,358
with the dressings on her leg.

1452
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:12,403
I'm still worried about an infection.

1453
00:58:12,404 --> 00:58:13,156
Okay.

1454
00:58:13,943 --> 00:58:14,510
Hey.

1455
00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:16,378
You know why she just
did what he said, right?

1456
00:58:17,851 --> 00:58:19,015
Because he's the gunther.

1457
00:58:20,554 --> 00:58:21,368
How did it go?

1458
00:58:21,775 --> 00:58:23,362
We'll have to go back
for definitive repairs,

1459
00:58:23,441 --> 00:58:24,718
but we stopped the major hemorrhaging,

1460
00:58:24,719 --> 00:58:25,870
- got the leg all cleaned out.
- Good.

1461
00:58:25,871 --> 00:58:27,309
- Nice work today, Avery.
- Thank you.

1462
00:58:27,310 --> 00:58:29,765
- Thank you, doctor.
- I just hope she, uh, pulls through.

1463
00:58:30,001 --> 00:58:30,600
Mm.

1464
00:58:32,158 --> 00:58:33,013
How's Alex?

1465
00:58:35,505 --> 00:58:36,485
He should be fine.

1466
00:58:36,486 --> 00:58:38,663
Apparently, he had an underlying arrhythmia,

1467
00:58:38,664 --> 00:58:39,618
so the epi...

1468
00:58:45,471 --> 00:58:47,081
I was moving too fast and I made a mistake.

1469
00:58:47,082 --> 00:58:47,915
You think?

1470
00:58:54,647 --> 00:58:56,460
Boy, you got a mean streak.

1471
00:58:56,547 --> 00:58:58,313
I mean, you look like a nice girl, but...

1472
00:58:59,142 --> 00:59:00,289
scratch the surface...

1473
00:59:05,030 --> 00:59:06,834
Don't mess with the nice ones.

1474
00:59:06,939 --> 00:59:07,843
Mnh-mnh.

1475
00:59:25,771 --> 00:59:27,472
I think I stole a baby.

1476
00:59:32,481 --> 00:59:35,244
Okay, first of all,
you didn't steal the baby.

1477
00:59:35,263 --> 00:59:36,222
She's your baby.

1478
00:59:36,464 --> 00:59:37,740
What you did is,

1479
00:59:38,498 --> 00:59:41,031
you took her for a nap...

1480
00:59:42,333 --> 00:59:44,484
in a very odd location

1481
00:59:44,626 --> 00:59:46,778
And you failed to answer your phone.

1482
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:50,096
But, you know, many people
find all the technology

1483
00:59:50,097 --> 00:59:51,478
in our lives to be intrusive.

1484
00:59:51,479 --> 00:59:53,950
So you're not the first person
who didn't answer her phone...

1485
00:59:54,954 --> 00:59:56,067
or her pager.

1486
00:59:57,457 --> 00:59:58,941
Well, and, you know, all we have to do is...

1487
00:59:58,942 --> 01:00:01,910
is find a reason why you
were awol for an hour.

1488
01:00:02,156 --> 01:00:03,147
Four...

1489
01:00:04,555 --> 01:00:05,660
hours.

1490
01:00:06,378 --> 01:00:08,546
Janet was gonna take the baby, so...

1491
01:00:08,547 --> 01:00:09,606
I took off.

1492
01:00:09,607 --> 01:00:11,325
Okay. Okay.

1493
01:00:12,273 --> 01:00:14,135
You know, people make mistakes.

1494
01:00:14,543 --> 01:00:17,101
I mean, I almost killed
Alex in the O.R. today.

1495
01:00:17,102 --> 01:00:18,988
So we'll just figure it out.

1496
01:00:19,147 --> 01:00:19,968
How?

1497
01:00:19,969 --> 01:00:21,085
- I don't know.
- No.

1498
01:00:21,086 --> 01:00:22,554
How'd you almost kill Alex?

1499
01:00:24,043 --> 01:00:25,351
With a C.C. of epi.

1500
01:00:25,832 --> 01:00:27,645
What-whatever. You know, he'll be fine.

1501
01:00:28,232 --> 01:00:29,276
Just, um...

1502
01:00:30,366 --> 01:00:32,363
just stay here. I'll fix this.

1503
01:00:32,828 --> 01:00:35,101
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna fix it.

1504
01:00:38,410 --> 01:00:39,678
Hand me a 10-blade, please.

1505
01:00:39,679 --> 01:00:40,579
Okay.

1506
01:00:42,129 --> 01:00:44,174
Have to be careful not to cut too deep

1507
01:00:44,175 --> 01:00:45,346
into the omentum.

1508
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:46,689
Uh, Dr. Webber.

1509
01:00:46,841 --> 01:00:47,710
Yes.

1510
01:00:48,034 --> 01:00:50,141
Hi. Uh, Teddy Altman here.

1511
01:00:50,265 --> 01:00:51,430
Yeah, nice to see you.

1512
01:00:52,004 --> 01:00:54,846
I-I thought that
Dr. Bailey was just observing.

1513
01:00:54,847 --> 01:00:58,042
Yeah, well, she's here,
so she's gonna make herself useful.

1514
01:00:59,553 --> 01:01:00,839
Dr. Webber, I'm a surgeon.

1515
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:01,986
That's the word on the street.

1516
01:01:01,987 --> 01:01:04,106
You have an attending assisting you

1517
01:01:04,107 --> 01:01:07,129
in a simple subcutaneous device insertion.

1518
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:10,410
You rushed Henry into surgery
with an hour's notice.

1519
01:01:11,707 --> 01:01:13,353
What... wh-what are you not telling me?

1520
01:01:13,354 --> 01:01:14,117
Dr. Altman...

1521
01:01:14,118 --> 01:01:15,606
Is there something that he didn't tell me

1522
01:01:15,607 --> 01:01:17,134
about his checkups?

1523
01:01:17,135 --> 01:01:19,892
I mean, is-is-is his hba1c to high?

1524
01:01:19,893 --> 01:01:20,615
Here we go.

1525
01:01:20,616 --> 01:01:21,545
Look, I am a doctor

1526
01:01:21,546 --> 01:01:23,139
and I know when something is wrong,

1527
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:25,020
and something is wrong.

1528
01:01:25,021 --> 01:01:26,901
Dr. Altman, I'm fond of you,

1529
01:01:27,017 --> 01:01:28,783
so I'm gonna count to 30 in my head

1530
01:01:28,784 --> 01:01:30,203
before I call security.

1531
01:01:31,587 --> 01:01:32,903
Richard, I'm-I'm just asking you...

1532
01:01:32,904 --> 01:01:35,840
Get out of my O.R. right now.

1533
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:50,945
I don't need to be here.

1534
01:01:50,946 --> 01:01:51,762
They just want to observe me

1535
01:01:51,763 --> 01:01:53,334
and make sure I don't pass out again.

1536
01:01:53,591 --> 01:01:54,217
Mm.

1537
01:01:55,403 --> 01:01:56,456
Not a bad idea.

1538
01:01:57,667 --> 01:01:58,625
How'd the kid do?

1539
01:01:58,892 --> 01:02:00,204
He has a few spinal fractures,

1540
01:02:00,205 --> 01:02:01,559
but it looks like he's out of the woods.

1541
01:02:02,217 --> 01:02:03,912
You need to make up with your friends.

1542
01:02:04,727 --> 01:02:05,549
Whatever.

1543
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:07,340
One of them almost killed you today.

1544
01:02:07,762 --> 01:02:08,648
It was an accident.

1545
01:02:08,702 --> 01:02:10,260
Nobody has your back.

1546
01:02:10,261 --> 01:02:11,563
Nobody is looking out for you.

1547
01:02:12,027 --> 01:02:13,357
That's when accidents happen, okay?

1548
01:02:13,358 --> 01:02:16,607
This isn't a personal problem.
This is a professional one.

1549
01:02:17,414 --> 01:02:18,480
It makes you a bad hire.

1550
01:02:22,915 --> 01:02:25,730
Also, it means that
I have to worry about you,

1551
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:27,327
because no one else is.

1552
01:02:28,175 --> 01:02:29,767
And I don't want to worry about you.

1553
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:32,665
I'd much rather be kicking
your ass on my peds ward.

1554
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:56,375
Cristina.

1555
01:03:01,869 --> 01:03:03,817
Do you want to sit and talk for a minute?

1556
01:03:07,252 --> 01:03:08,801
I do. I...

1557
01:03:09,252 --> 01:03:10,680
I really very much do,

1558
01:03:12,046 --> 01:03:13,744
but I have to go do something right now,

1559
01:03:13,745 --> 01:03:14,909
and it can't wait.

1560
01:03:14,979 --> 01:03:15,916
Please...

1561
01:03:17,189 --> 01:03:19,053
please believe that I want to talk to you

1562
01:03:19,054 --> 01:03:22,254
and I'm not blowing you off
because I'm a terrible person

1563
01:03:22,255 --> 01:03:23,673
or because I don't care about you.

1564
01:03:23,811 --> 01:03:25,223
None of that is true.

1565
01:03:36,088 --> 01:03:37,000
She okay?

1566
01:03:37,785 --> 01:03:38,890
Uh, no change.

1567
01:03:39,405 --> 01:03:40,345
I just...

1568
01:03:41,284 --> 01:03:42,233
I don't want to mess this up

1569
01:03:42,234 --> 01:03:43,948
like I messed up everything else.

1570
01:03:44,813 --> 01:03:46,378
What? You were great in the O.R.

1571
01:03:47,132 --> 01:03:48,548
I wasn't the gunther.

1572
01:03:48,563 --> 01:03:50,556
I was a super-duper assistant.

1573
01:03:53,583 --> 01:03:55,567
Are they gonna fire me as chief resident?

1574
01:03:55,568 --> 01:03:56,603
No.

1575
01:03:56,742 --> 01:03:57,782
It was your first day.

1576
01:03:58,371 --> 01:03:59,269
They'll just...

1577
01:04:00,553 --> 01:04:01,636
make you do it again.

1578
01:04:06,848 --> 01:04:08,205
It's time to place the device.

1579
01:04:14,979 --> 01:04:16,059
What do you want me to do?

1580
01:04:16,368 --> 01:04:17,566
Place the device.

1581
01:04:20,918 --> 01:04:23,863
Sir, is there anything you want to tell me?

1582
01:04:24,604 --> 01:04:25,571
Don't screw it up.

1583
01:04:30,076 --> 01:04:32,550
A surgeon doing the early stages

1584
01:04:32,565 --> 01:04:35,798
of human trials on
his experimental procedure

1585
01:04:35,837 --> 01:04:37,562
never hands over the reins

1586
01:04:37,562 --> 01:04:38,837
to someone else, ever,

1587
01:04:38,913 --> 01:04:40,353
unless something is wrong.

1588
01:04:40,353 --> 01:04:42,173
Altman said this was weird,

1589
01:04:42,236 --> 01:04:44,339
- but I just thought she was being a wife.
- Bailey...

1590
01:04:44,768 --> 01:04:46,337
Are you drinking again?

1591
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:49,215
Ooh, that would explain a lot.

1592
01:04:49,243 --> 01:04:51,708
Yes, it would. God,
I wish it were that simple.

1593
01:04:51,932 --> 01:04:53,483
Pick up those forceps, Dr. Bailey.

1594
01:05:01,267 --> 01:05:03,736
Now watch the superficial arteries.

1595
01:05:03,748 --> 01:05:04,981
That's where it gets dicey.

1596
01:05:05,127 --> 01:05:07,117
Let's get more retraction, Dr. Grey.

1597
01:05:08,796 --> 01:05:11,702
Right. Okay. Don't-don't... don't rush it.

1598
01:05:11,702 --> 01:05:14,118
All right. You see those blood vessels?

1599
01:05:14,118 --> 01:05:14,643
Yep.

1600
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:18,812
Implant the device as close
to those as possible.

1601
01:05:18,827 --> 01:05:20,695
Without their oxygen supply,

1602
01:05:20,726 --> 01:05:22,261
the islet cells would die off.

1603
01:05:23,437 --> 01:05:24,184
Good.

1604
01:05:25,602 --> 01:05:27,995
And eventually the vessels

1605
01:05:28,051 --> 01:05:31,286
will just take over the oxygen delivery

1606
01:05:31,317 --> 01:05:32,992
to the device completely.

1607
01:05:33,398 --> 01:05:35,009
Look at that.

1608
01:05:35,150 --> 01:05:36,419
It's interesting, right?

1609
01:05:37,743 --> 01:05:39,321
It's actually kind of beautiful.

1610
01:05:41,231 --> 01:05:42,536
Nice work, Dr. Bailey.

1611
01:05:43,719 --> 01:05:44,458
Close him up.

1612
01:05:51,642 --> 01:05:53,348
Did-did-did he just...

1613
01:05:56,187 --> 01:05:57,209
He just left?

1614
01:05:59,924 --> 01:06:00,595
Get up.

1615
01:06:01,267 --> 01:06:04,099
No. I'm under 24-hour observation

1616
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:06,315
because you almost killed me!

1617
01:06:06,328 --> 01:06:08,294
I revealed an arrhythmia
you didn't know you have.

1618
01:06:08,345 --> 01:06:09,347
I probably saved your life.

1619
01:06:09,368 --> 01:06:11,190
I'll run an E.K.G.
on you later. Just get up.

1620
01:06:11,190 --> 01:06:12,869
You're supposed to have my back.

1621
01:06:12,975 --> 01:06:14,167
I made a mistake.

1622
01:06:14,372 --> 01:06:15,968
All right? I-I-I was drunk,

1623
01:06:16,005 --> 01:06:17,552
- I was pissed off...
- Oh, for the love of g...

1624
01:06:17,552 --> 01:06:19,580
No, I screwed up! You screw up all the time.

1625
01:06:19,712 --> 01:06:22,172
I don't have anybody.
You guys are all I have.

1626
01:06:22,172 --> 01:06:24,035
- You have to forgive me!
- Fine!

1627
01:06:24,035 --> 01:06:25,362
Whatever. Forgiven.

1628
01:06:25,522 --> 01:06:27,752
Just... get up out of the damn bed.

1629
01:06:31,274 --> 01:06:33,353
Oh, sorry. I was paged here.

1630
01:06:33,373 --> 01:06:34,014
That was us.

1631
01:06:34,126 --> 01:06:35,972
We paged your wife, too.
Do you know where she is?

1632
01:06:35,996 --> 01:06:37,730
Well, that is the question of the hour.

1633
01:06:37,767 --> 01:06:38,537
I have no idea where she is.

1634
01:06:38,668 --> 01:06:40,034
Well, we'll fill her in later.

1635
01:06:40,348 --> 01:06:41,503
Shut the door, please.

1636
01:06:45,475 --> 01:06:47,168
Dr. Webber just informed me

1637
01:06:47,168 --> 01:06:49,253
that he tampered with the drugs and placebos

1638
01:06:49,253 --> 01:06:50,107
in your clinical trial.

1639
01:06:50,748 --> 01:06:51,786
Excuse me?

1640
01:06:53,845 --> 01:06:54,520
N-no.

1641
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:56,466
It was, uh... Meredith.

1642
01:06:56,478 --> 01:06:58,474
Dr. Grey apparently was covering for him.

1643
01:06:59,573 --> 01:07:00,535
She knew and she...

1644
01:07:01,929 --> 01:07:03,189
was trying to protect him.

1645
01:07:05,653 --> 01:07:07,173
You have my apologies.

1646
01:07:10,478 --> 01:07:11,754
I destroyed your trial.

1647
01:07:21,050 --> 01:07:22,551
She wasn't covering for you.

1648
01:07:23,711 --> 01:07:24,753
What the hell are you doing?

1649
01:07:24,789 --> 01:07:27,147
I'm protecting your wife.
What are you doing?

1650
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:28,363
This is wrong, and you know that.

1651
01:07:28,363 --> 01:07:29,440
What are you trying to do to her?

1652
01:07:29,554 --> 01:07:32,288
She was trying to save Adele.
She was trying to save me.

1653
01:07:32,490 --> 01:07:34,916
At what point are you gonna
stop punishing her for that?

1654
01:07:42,142 --> 01:07:44,049
And there's no pain in your abdomen?

1655
01:07:44,596 --> 01:07:45,319
Nope.

1656
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:48,533
Really? Or are you just being stoic for me?

1657
01:07:48,545 --> 01:07:50,917
I'm a man in a gown. I can't
pretend to be brave and strong.

1658
01:07:50,952 --> 01:07:51,695
You can.

1659
01:07:53,710 --> 01:07:55,200
I kinda lost it today.

1660
01:07:56,503 --> 01:07:58,220
Dr. Webber kicked me out of the O.R.

1661
01:07:58,683 --> 01:07:59,253
Really?

1662
01:08:00,052 --> 01:08:02,116
Okay, um, so...

1663
01:08:06,787 --> 01:08:10,257
You know how we both figured
that since I was a doctor

1664
01:08:10,270 --> 01:08:12,817
that... I would be really calm

1665
01:08:12,817 --> 01:08:14,560
- while you were having your surgery?
- Mm-hmm.

1666
01:08:15,188 --> 01:08:16,702
That may not be the case.

1667
01:08:19,105 --> 01:08:21,877
You're just a mess,
like any ordinary wife would be?

1668
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:23,357
Yeah, it's pathetic.

1669
01:08:25,153 --> 01:08:26,476
I think it's adorable.

1670
01:08:28,987 --> 01:08:30,777
I have a chronic tumor condition.

1671
01:08:31,877 --> 01:08:33,429
I'm a frequent flyer in the O.R.

1672
01:08:37,051 --> 01:08:39,385
I'm gonna be a basket case every time.

1673
01:08:39,385 --> 01:08:40,082
So sad.

1674
01:08:52,603 --> 01:08:55,249
Uh, if you're headed in there,
you may want to wait.

1675
01:08:55,249 --> 01:08:57,805
They're acting like he just
came back from the wars.

1676
01:08:59,274 --> 01:09:00,045
What?

1677
01:09:00,927 --> 01:09:02,304
Something happened with the chief.

1678
01:09:02,978 --> 01:09:03,696
W...

1679
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:10,042
Where have you been?

1680
01:09:10,042 --> 01:09:11,400
We've been trying to reach you for hours.

1681
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:13,449
I'm sorry.

1682
01:09:13,462 --> 01:09:14,096
Where's Zola?

1683
01:09:26,236 --> 01:09:28,733
Hey. Susannah just got out of surgery,

1684
01:09:28,758 --> 01:09:30,702
and it went as well as it could have.

1685
01:09:30,725 --> 01:09:32,566
We're not gonna know
much for a little while.

1686
01:09:33,265 --> 01:09:34,089
Okay.

1687
01:09:34,106 --> 01:09:34,821
Look right here.

1688
01:09:35,042 --> 01:09:37,500
We had such an awful fight right before.

1689
01:09:38,267 --> 01:09:39,575
I...

1690
01:09:39,588 --> 01:09:41,296
I brought up her mother in an argument,

1691
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:43,609
and th-that-that is one of the red buttons.

1692
01:09:43,821 --> 01:09:46,749
I swore I would never do that.
Why-why did I do that?

1693
01:09:46,749 --> 01:09:48,927
She'll forgive you. You saved her life.

1694
01:09:49,245 --> 01:09:52,000
Maybe for a while,
and then she'll get better

1695
01:09:52,047 --> 01:09:53,517
and she'll remember why
she got out of the car.

1696
01:09:53,537 --> 01:09:55,729
Maybe she won't. You know?

1697
01:09:56,209 --> 01:09:59,385
Maybe you both just decide
to forget, move on...

1698
01:10:00,668 --> 01:10:01,852
Pretend it never happened.

1699
01:10:02,371 --> 01:10:03,458
Does that work?

1700
01:10:04,682 --> 01:10:05,696
It can't hurt to try.

1701
01:10:07,977 --> 01:10:09,130
You're married?

1702
01:10:11,965 --> 01:10:13,995
I-I'm sorry. It's... it's not my business.

1703
01:10:14,009 --> 01:10:14,928
I didn't mean to pry.

1704
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,275
Oh, that's all right. Yes.

1705
01:10:16,799 --> 01:10:17,893
Yes, I'm married.

1706
01:10:20,473 --> 01:10:22,056
What did you do?!

1707
01:10:22,493 --> 01:10:24,023
I want you to shut the door

1708
01:10:24,023 --> 01:10:25,330
and then I want you to sit down.

1709
01:10:25,330 --> 01:10:27,619
You're throwing your whole career away

1710
01:10:27,638 --> 01:10:28,835
for that damn girl?

1711
01:10:28,835 --> 01:10:30,922
This is not the end of my career.

1712
01:10:30,939 --> 01:10:33,170
The FDA will never come
anywhere near you again.

1713
01:10:33,183 --> 01:10:35,505
That is the end of your islet cell trial,

1714
01:10:35,574 --> 01:10:37,499
not to mention any other thing
you might be cooking up with

1715
01:10:37,535 --> 01:10:38,934
- the FDA...
- Sit down!

1716
01:10:40,780 --> 01:10:41,753
You...

1717
01:10:46,345 --> 01:10:47,202
Open it...

1718
01:10:48,231 --> 01:10:48,812
What...

1719
01:10:50,199 --> 01:10:51,761
And read the first page.

1720
01:10:52,518 --> 01:10:54,749
"The artificial pancreas:
A cure for diabet..."

1721
01:10:54,788 --> 01:10:56,821
How about "The artificial pancreas:"

1722
01:10:56,821 --> 01:10:59,704
"A-a huge missed opportunity that you blew"

1723
01:10:59,752 --> 01:11:01,482
- "because you..."
- Read the next line.

1724
01:11:03,605 --> 01:11:05,664
"Principal investigator: Miranda Bail..."

1725
01:11:07,665 --> 01:11:08,582
It's yours now.

1726
01:11:10,005 --> 01:11:12,190
I have no pending trials with the FDA.

1727
01:11:17,885 --> 01:11:21,082
Ever since her surgery,
Zola's had weekly blood tests,

1728
01:11:21,082 --> 01:11:22,680
and, uh, the results I got today

1729
01:11:22,722 --> 01:11:25,259
were a little weird,
so I wanted to take a look at her.

1730
01:11:25,259 --> 01:11:26,804
Yeah, and, you know, with babies,

1731
01:11:26,822 --> 01:11:28,838
I mean, when a doctor calls... I got worried,

1732
01:11:28,904 --> 01:11:30,013
so I just rushed her right in,

1733
01:11:30,061 --> 01:11:32,427
and I must have left my phone
in the day care center.

1734
01:11:32,447 --> 01:11:33,182
And your pager.

1735
01:11:33,227 --> 01:11:36,068
My pager I had to turn
in because they fired me.

1736
01:11:36,791 --> 01:11:37,757
What's wrong with her?

1737
01:11:40,623 --> 01:11:42,626
Her white count was elevated.

1738
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:45,139
14.5. Um, I wanted to make sure there wasn't

1739
01:11:45,168 --> 01:11:47,925
a post-op infection or a
C.S.F. leak or something.

1740
01:11:48,138 --> 01:11:50,839
Um, on my exam, she looks fine.

1741
01:11:50,853 --> 01:11:52,290
No signs of spinal shock.

1742
01:11:52,290 --> 01:11:55,749
I re-ran her C.B.C.,
and her white count was 8.

1743
01:11:55,846 --> 01:11:56,740
Totally normal.

1744
01:11:57,016 --> 01:11:58,713
Must have just been a stress reactant...

1745
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:01,621
Or a fluke in the labs, 'cause,
uh, well, she's fine.

1746
01:12:10,083 --> 01:12:10,765
It's true.

1747
01:12:10,842 --> 01:12:14,059
C.S.F. leaks are a problem
with spina bifida babies.

1748
01:12:15,153 --> 01:12:16,300
That's... that's great you caught that.

1749
01:12:32,928 --> 01:12:35,329
I'm sorry. I didn't mean for any of this...

1750
01:12:36,183 --> 01:12:37,790
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.

1751
01:12:41,216 --> 01:12:43,228
I know. I know.

1752
01:12:46,735 --> 01:12:47,931
I still don't understand

1753
01:12:47,952 --> 01:12:49,775
what you possibly could've been thinking.

1754
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:51,477
They fired me.

1755
01:12:52,011 --> 01:12:55,011
Janet basically told me
they were gonna take Zola away.

1756
01:12:55,055 --> 01:12:57,260
I mean, possibly send her back to Malawi.

1757
01:12:58,117 --> 01:12:59,324
You and me?

1758
01:13:01,284 --> 01:13:03,342
I just needed some time.

1759
01:13:04,845 --> 01:13:07,385
I just needed to hold her and look at her

1760
01:13:07,407 --> 01:13:09,757
and just think about how everything...

1761
01:13:10,847 --> 01:13:13,662
everything got so screwed up.

1762
01:13:17,313 --> 01:13:18,853
You should take Zola.

1763
01:13:19,652 --> 01:13:21,993
Janet has a problem with me, not with you.

1764
01:13:21,993 --> 01:13:23,601
And we need to do whatever we can

1765
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:25,110
to make sure they don't take her away,

1766
01:13:25,121 --> 01:13:27,469
and if that means that you have
custody of her and I don't,

1767
01:13:27,469 --> 01:13:29,113
well, then that's what we need to do.

1768
01:13:29,466 --> 01:13:30,678
You're not fired.

1769
01:13:30,868 --> 01:13:32,702
Richard's gonna take the fall for you.

1770
01:13:33,015 --> 01:13:33,784
What?

1771
01:13:34,683 --> 01:13:36,706
He can't do that.
I'm not gonna let him do that.

1772
01:13:36,751 --> 01:13:37,516
Yes, you will.

1773
01:13:37,528 --> 01:13:41,087
If you want to keep this baby,
you will let him protect you.

1774
01:13:53,408 --> 01:13:54,212
Dan?

1775
01:13:54,212 --> 01:13:55,446
Oh, my god.

1776
01:13:55,756 --> 01:13:56,583
Sweetheart.

1777
01:13:56,949 --> 01:13:58,764
Danny, I was scared.

1778
01:13:58,774 --> 01:13:59,597
Oh, I know.

1779
01:13:59,610 --> 01:14:01,390
I didn't know where you were.

1780
01:14:01,822 --> 01:14:02,887
I'm right here.

1781
01:14:03,423 --> 01:14:04,479
You-you were asleep,

1782
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:06,272
and they-they didn't
want me to wake you up.

1783
01:14:07,195 --> 01:14:08,344
I fell down.

1784
01:14:08,376 --> 01:14:10,225
You sure did.

1785
01:14:10,943 --> 01:14:12,232
You stayed, though.

1786
01:14:12,674 --> 01:14:13,882
I'm not going anywhere.

1787
01:14:14,337 --> 01:14:15,224
Don't go anywhere.

1788
01:14:15,224 --> 01:14:16,024
I'm right here.

1789
01:14:16,768 --> 01:14:18,809
Oh, I love you so much.

1790
01:14:32,332 --> 01:14:33,916
You're a big baby.

1791
01:14:47,322 --> 01:14:47,962
- Mm.
- Okay.

1792
01:14:49,479 --> 01:14:50,933
All right, the top row

1793
01:14:51,205 --> 01:14:53,472
all got the device on the first round.

1794
01:14:53,579 --> 01:14:55,216
Dr. Webber tweaked the protocol

1795
01:14:55,216 --> 01:14:56,903
pretty substantially after that,

1796
01:14:56,928 --> 01:14:59,287
which means the second set,
that's these guys here,

1797
01:14:59,346 --> 01:15:02,043
they all... tend to do a lot better.

1798
01:15:02,070 --> 01:15:04,766
I've been off the project for
the last couple of weeks,

1799
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:06,250
but I'm pretty sure I remember the drill.

1800
01:15:07,124 --> 01:15:08,450
I can walk you through it.

1801
01:15:10,798 --> 01:15:12,681
It had to be mice.

1802
01:15:15,975 --> 01:15:16,845
All right.

1803
01:15:16,845 --> 01:15:18,321
Let's take it from the top.

1804
01:15:35,893 --> 01:15:36,937
How's it looking?

1805
01:15:36,952 --> 01:15:37,560
Can't tell.

1806
01:15:38,604 --> 01:15:41,107
They can't just take
the baby away, can they?

1807
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:42,874
I don't know.

1808
01:16:16,330 --> 01:16:18,174
Meredith says you didn't do it yet.

1809
01:16:21,456 --> 01:16:23,323
I didn't change my mind.

1810
01:16:25,332 --> 01:16:26,036
I know.

1811
01:16:27,356 --> 01:16:29,061
I know. You don't change your mind.

1812
01:16:37,563 --> 01:16:39,406
You'd cut off my leg for me, wouldn't you?

1813
01:16:44,531 --> 01:16:46,784
Well, I wouldn't botch it like that guy did.

1814
01:16:46,811 --> 01:16:49,283
I'd leave you a good stump so
you could get a prosthesis.

1815
01:17:00,973 --> 01:17:02,251
When's the appointment?

1816
01:17:09,381 --> 01:17:09,990
Now.

1817
01:17:16,456 --> 01:17:18,526
Okay.

1818
01:17:20,944 --> 01:17:21,890
Okay.

1819
01:17:26,031 --> 01:17:26,780
Let's go.

1820
01:17:30,024 --> 01:17:31,066
I...

1821
01:17:31,659 --> 01:17:32,319
Oh, god.

1822
01:17:48,369 --> 01:17:50,904
They're not gonna find
a better family than two doctors.

1823
01:17:50,919 --> 01:17:52,186
It's-it's gonna be fine.

1824
01:17:53,048 --> 01:17:54,761
Anybody want to go check on Sofia?

1825
01:17:55,033 --> 01:17:55,907
Why?

1826
01:17:56,788 --> 01:17:58,566
'Cause when somebody's talking about

1827
01:17:58,609 --> 01:18:00,670
taking someone's baby away,

1828
01:18:00,684 --> 01:18:02,387
you want you to see your baby.

1829
01:18:02,387 --> 01:18:04,034
Oh, you guys. She's fine.

1830
01:18:06,235 --> 01:18:07,628
I'm right behind you.

1831
01:18:15,951 --> 01:18:18,168
Ma-maybe we should leave, too.

1832
01:18:18,181 --> 01:18:19,453
I mean, I'm sure they don't want us

1833
01:18:19,473 --> 01:18:20,882
just sitting here staring at them.

1834
01:18:21,946 --> 01:18:22,966
I don't know.

1835
01:18:23,732 --> 01:18:25,241
They're trying to keep a family together.

1836
01:18:25,254 --> 01:18:26,692
That's... not easy.

1837
01:18:27,501 --> 01:18:28,519
You know, it can't hurt to stick around,

1838
01:18:28,519 --> 01:18:29,443
make sure they're okay.

1839
01:18:31,082 --> 01:18:33,404
You see, this-this is
why you're the gunther.

1840
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:36,142
I have terrible leadership instincts.

1841
01:18:37,511 --> 01:18:39,140
That doesn't make me a better leader.

1842
01:18:41,382 --> 01:18:42,685
A better person maybe, but...

1843
01:18:45,114 --> 01:18:47,491
We are in a bit of a bind right now.

1844
01:18:48,749 --> 01:18:50,241
A lot of questions came up today

1845
01:18:50,241 --> 01:18:52,191
about your relationship,

1846
01:18:52,733 --> 01:18:53,635
about your employment...

1847
01:18:53,662 --> 01:18:55,682
Well, she got her job back.
That was a misunderstanding.

1848
01:18:56,563 --> 01:18:57,642
She disappeared.

1849
01:18:57,942 --> 01:19:00,131
Well, that was a-a miscommunication.

1850
01:19:00,131 --> 01:19:03,283
And the part about you two
living in separate houses,

1851
01:19:03,297 --> 01:19:05,033
that's miscommunication, too?

1852
01:19:05,984 --> 01:19:07,141
Look, I get it.

1853
01:19:07,812 --> 01:19:11,063
It's not easy bringing
a child into a relationship.

1854
01:19:11,095 --> 01:19:13,269
You're allowed to have
some bumps in the road.

1855
01:19:13,993 --> 01:19:16,050
But this afternoon, when it looked like

1856
01:19:16,082 --> 01:19:18,818
you two had split up, your wife got fired,

1857
01:19:19,189 --> 01:19:22,481
she lied to me about it
and left with the baby.

1858
01:19:22,481 --> 01:19:24,104
I set off some alarms.

1859
01:19:24,128 --> 01:19:26,597
Now I'm trying to dial them all back,

1860
01:19:26,625 --> 01:19:28,119
but it's not that easy to do.

1861
01:19:28,357 --> 01:19:30,307
Once the system is set in motion,

1862
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:32,481
there's a certain protocol
that has to be followed.

1863
01:19:32,738 --> 01:19:34,080
Once the agency believes

1864
01:19:34,116 --> 01:19:35,665
that there are questions about Meredith...

1865
01:19:35,665 --> 01:19:37,206
Janet, Meredith is the best mother

1866
01:19:37,596 --> 01:19:38,456
a child could have.

1867
01:19:39,081 --> 01:19:41,739
She loves Zola. She loves me.

1868
01:19:41,996 --> 01:19:43,687
And if there is a flaw with her, it's...

1869
01:19:44,582 --> 01:19:46,926
she loves people so much that
she'll do anything for them.

1870
01:19:46,945 --> 01:19:48,394
Derek, please.

1871
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:51,261
I hear you.

1872
01:19:52,001 --> 01:19:54,182
But no matter what I say,

1873
01:19:54,207 --> 01:19:57,422
social services still has
to reevaluate the placement.

1874
01:19:58,565 --> 01:19:59,961
And while that happens,

1875
01:20:00,236 --> 01:20:01,727
Zola can't be in your home.

1876
01:20:07,127 --> 01:20:08,982
I'll give you a minute to say good-bye.

1877
01:20:18,629 --> 01:20:21,371
We should... we should let her sleep.

1878
01:20:22,041 --> 01:20:24,789
She's ours. Nobody's taking her away.

1879
01:20:24,819 --> 01:20:25,528
And...

1880
01:20:26,851 --> 01:20:29,052
she'll wake up in half an hour,

1881
01:20:29,071 --> 01:20:29,736
and then we'll...

1882
01:20:30,435 --> 01:20:31,838
take her home for dinner.

1883
01:20:32,833 --> 01:20:33,500
So...

1884
01:20:37,210 --> 01:20:38,908
- Nah. We should wake her up.
- Yeah.

1885
01:20:41,848 --> 01:20:43,611
Hi, little baby.

1886
01:20:43,627 --> 01:20:44,617
Daddy's here.

1887
01:20:44,638 --> 01:20:45,577
- Boo.
- Hi.

1888
01:20:46,004 --> 01:20:47,123
Daddy's here...

1889
01:20:47,123 --> 01:20:48,136
Hi, sweet girl.

1890
01:20:48,136 --> 01:20:49,107
Little goose.

1891
01:21:01,481 --> 01:21:03,215
Adele. Honey.

1892
01:21:03,390 --> 01:21:04,584
Yeah, I'm on my way home.

1893
01:21:06,075 --> 01:21:08,118
No, I'm not working late.

1894
01:21:08,528 --> 01:21:10,332
I told you, I'm having dinner with you.

1895
01:21:13,661 --> 01:21:14,660
Yeah, well...

1896
01:21:15,699 --> 01:21:16,891
This time I mean it.

1897
01:21:18,941 --> 01:21:19,543
Okay.

1898
01:21:25,541 --> 01:21:28,160
I'm gonna give you
an injection to numb the cervix.

1899
01:21:28,173 --> 01:21:30,824
If you'd like some I.V. diazepam,

1900
01:21:30,824 --> 01:21:33,502
it won't knock you out,
but it'll calm you down.

1901
01:21:35,956 --> 01:21:36,725
Okay.

1902
01:21:37,998 --> 01:21:39,765
I want to ask you one more time...

1903
01:21:41,616 --> 01:21:44,579
Are you absolutely sure
this is what you want to do?

1904
01:21:54,109 --> 01:21:55,378
Then let's get started.

1905
01:22:24,627 --> 01:22:25,627
Sorry...

1906
01:22:25,927 --> 01:22:27,283
It's... time to go.

1907
01:22:37,416 --> 01:22:38,431
Derek.

1908
01:22:39,728 --> 01:22:40,588
Here you go.

1909
01:22:41,770 --> 01:22:43,426
Okay. Hey.

1910
01:22:45,329 --> 01:22:48,023
Janet is a very nice lady.

1911
01:22:48,592 --> 01:22:49,621
We like her a lot.

1912
01:22:50,266 --> 01:22:51,083
Yeah.

1913
01:22:51,566 --> 01:22:53,642
She's gonna find you a very nice family

1914
01:22:53,674 --> 01:22:54,791
to go stay with for a while.

1915
01:22:55,348 --> 01:22:57,501
And then you're gonna come right back to us,

1916
01:22:57,543 --> 01:22:59,175
and everything's gonna be fine.

1917
01:23:03,971 --> 01:23:04,788
Okay?

1918
01:23:07,512 --> 01:23:08,478
Okay.

1919
01:23:12,660 --> 01:23:14,113
She likes her bottle

1920
01:23:14,363 --> 01:23:15,988
room temperature, not too warm.

1921
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:19,192
And she cannot sleep without that giraffe.

1922
01:23:19,214 --> 01:23:21,230
It's in the front pocket of the diaper bag.

1923
01:23:21,552 --> 01:23:23,360
And there's extra pacifiers in there.

1924
01:23:23,381 --> 01:23:25,376
You're gonna need them when
