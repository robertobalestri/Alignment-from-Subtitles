1
00:00:00,699 --> 00:00:02,575
Ben and I are getting a divorce.

2
00:00:02,577 --> 00:00:04,872
I really just wanna move on.

3
00:00:05,666 --> 00:00:08,168
I'll be around the ED more
often if I can ever help out.

4
00:00:08,169 --> 00:00:09,753
Are you flying anywhere today?

5
00:00:09,754 --> 00:00:12,172
- No, shift just ended.
- Treatment seven.

6
00:00:12,173 --> 00:00:14,966
Welcome to the team, Dr. Johnson.

7
00:00:14,967 --> 00:00:17,143
Something's wrong with Dad.

8
00:00:17,144 --> 00:00:18,970
He's forgetting things.

9
00:00:18,972 --> 00:00:20,355
It's getting worse.

10
00:00:20,356 --> 00:00:22,691
He doesn't know where he is.

11
00:00:22,692 --> 00:00:25,026
Damn.

12
00:00:25,027 --> 00:00:26,945
You've already flamed
out of two hospitals,

13
00:00:26,946 --> 00:00:29,114
and you're doing your best
to flame out of a third?

14
00:00:29,115 --> 00:00:30,615
So I'm not fired?

15
00:00:30,616 --> 00:00:31,992
Medical ethics course.

16
00:00:31,993 --> 00:00:33,869
If I were you, I'd take notes.

17
00:00:36,182 --> 00:00:37,683
Wow.

18
00:00:37,685 --> 00:00:40,388
How does that make you feel?

19
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,943
I'm not sure.

20
00:00:41,944 --> 00:00:43,612
It is what it is.

21
00:00:43,613 --> 00:00:46,781
- Good morning, Peter.
- Morning, Maggie. Dr. Ahmad.

22
00:00:46,782 --> 00:00:48,742
Do we have a notary in house?

23
00:00:48,743 --> 00:00:49,951
I have some papers to sign.

24
00:00:49,952 --> 00:00:51,286
Yeah, Edward.

25
00:00:51,287 --> 00:00:52,954
I'll send him down
at the end of the day.

26
00:00:52,955 --> 00:00:54,581
You need some help?

27
00:00:54,582 --> 00:00:56,458
- Are you a doctor?
- I am. What happened?

28
00:00:56,459 --> 00:00:58,460
I don't know. I've never
seen this man before.

29
00:00:58,461 --> 00:01:00,253
He was wandering a
couple blocks from here.

30
00:01:00,254 --> 00:01:02,047
He kept saying, "Help Betty."

31
00:01:02,048 --> 00:01:03,215
He's really cold.

32
00:01:03,216 --> 00:01:04,758
Okay, let's get him inside.

33
00:01:04,759 --> 00:01:06,302
Betty.

34
00:01:08,955 --> 00:01:10,205
Dr. Sorensen.

35
00:01:10,206 --> 00:01:11,873
No, I'm Dr. Ripley.

36
00:01:11,874 --> 00:01:13,208
Nancy, he's hypothermic.

37
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:14,292
I need blankets and warm IV bags.

38
00:01:14,293 --> 00:01:15,669
On it. You're going to five.

39
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,130
Okay.

40
00:01:18,131 --> 00:01:20,674
Help Betty.

41
00:01:20,675 --> 00:01:21,875
Betty?

42
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:25,053
Hey, Daniel.

43
00:01:25,054 --> 00:01:27,222
- Morning.
- Good morning.

44
00:01:27,223 --> 00:01:28,974
When was the last time you saw Bert?

45
00:01:28,975 --> 00:01:30,934
Not for a while.

46
00:01:30,935 --> 00:01:32,060
I mean, come to think of it,

47
00:01:32,061 --> 00:01:34,062
I did call him a couple weeks ago,

48
00:01:34,063 --> 00:01:36,273
and he was in a hurry.

49
00:01:36,274 --> 00:01:38,442
Said he'd call me back, and
I'm now realizing he never did.

50
00:01:38,443 --> 00:01:40,777
Yeah, and is that
something you've noticed...

51
00:01:40,778 --> 00:01:42,362
- his memory?
- Not really.

52
00:01:42,363 --> 00:01:44,573
I mean, that could happen to any of us.

53
00:01:44,574 --> 00:01:46,241
I mean, I do that stuff all the time.

54
00:01:46,242 --> 00:01:47,325
Why? Are you worried about him?

55
00:01:47,326 --> 00:01:49,536
I don't know, but Tara is.

56
00:01:49,537 --> 00:01:50,912
And he was here.

57
00:01:50,913 --> 00:01:53,790
He fell when he was watching Isaiah.

58
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:55,167
He fell?

59
00:01:55,168 --> 00:01:58,295
Yeah, nothing serious,
but he did twist his knee.

60
00:01:58,296 --> 00:02:00,172
He just seemed a little confused,

61
00:02:00,173 --> 00:02:01,757
and I wouldn't be concerned,

62
00:02:01,758 --> 00:02:05,260
but Bert does have a
family history of dementia.

63
00:02:05,261 --> 00:02:07,512
We should probably have him checked out.

64
00:02:07,513 --> 00:02:11,725
To get Bert to see a doctor
for anything is an ordeal.

65
00:02:11,726 --> 00:02:13,727
- You know that.
- Right, tell me about it.

66
00:02:13,728 --> 00:02:17,272
But he's coming here today
for a follow-up on his knee.

67
00:02:17,273 --> 00:02:19,357
Oh, well, why don't I just, you know,

68
00:02:19,358 --> 00:02:22,277
spontaneously stop
by, have a little chat?

69
00:02:22,278 --> 00:02:23,862
That would be great.

70
00:02:23,863 --> 00:02:25,740
Thank you.

71
00:02:27,617 --> 00:02:28,825
Hi, Alex.

72
00:02:28,826 --> 00:02:30,952
- Hi.
- I'm Dr. Ahmad.

73
00:02:30,953 --> 00:02:33,121
Emily. My husband, Mark.

74
00:02:33,122 --> 00:02:36,166
So I see that your heart rate is fast.

75
00:02:36,167 --> 00:02:37,918
I don't feel it.

76
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,753
But his watch says it's at 140.

77
00:02:39,754 --> 00:02:42,089
It's probably nothing, but
that's why we brought him in.

78
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,008
Well, your watch isn't lying, 140.

79
00:02:45,009 --> 00:02:47,010
Rest of your vitals are good.

80
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:48,136
Is there anything bothering you?

81
00:02:48,137 --> 00:02:49,304
No, I feel fine.

82
00:02:49,305 --> 00:02:50,889
Normally, he eats like a horse,

83
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,308
but the last couple of days,
he's hardly had anything.

84
00:02:53,309 --> 00:02:55,103
I just wasn't hungry.

85
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,233
Lungs sound good.

86
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:04,528
Lymph nodes aren't swollen.

87
00:03:04,529 --> 00:03:05,987
Any tenderness?

88
00:03:05,988 --> 00:03:07,656
Mm-mm.

89
00:03:07,657 --> 00:03:08,857
What about here?

90
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:11,868
Yeah, a little bit.

91
00:03:11,869 --> 00:03:13,370
What does that mean?

92
00:03:13,371 --> 00:03:16,165
I'm not sure, but I'd like
to order a CT to find out.

93
00:03:18,501 --> 00:03:20,252
- Okay.
- I'll put the order in.

94
00:03:20,253 --> 00:03:21,753
I'll be back to check on you soon.

95
00:03:21,754 --> 00:03:22,796
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

96
00:03:22,797 --> 00:03:24,965
Thank you.

97
00:03:24,966 --> 00:03:26,508
- Loren?
- Maggie.

98
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:29,094
Kaitlin Neeley, 28, septic shock.

99
00:03:29,095 --> 00:03:31,680
Leukocytosis and hypotensive.

100
00:03:31,681 --> 00:03:35,016
BP 80/43, temp 103.5.

101
00:03:35,017 --> 00:03:36,226
She was pregnant.

102
00:03:36,227 --> 00:03:37,936
Water broke at 15 weeks pre-viability.

103
00:03:37,937 --> 00:03:39,354
That was two weeks ago.

104
00:03:39,355 --> 00:03:41,022
It's not there. It's not there.

105
00:03:41,023 --> 00:03:42,232
No, don't say it.

106
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:44,401
- No, no.
- Honey, everything's okay.

107
00:03:44,402 --> 00:03:46,403
We're at the hospital.
They're gonna take care of you.

108
00:03:46,404 --> 00:03:49,239
They were driving here, but she
got so sick, they had to pull over.

109
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,615
Rural clinic didn't have the
capabilities to care for her,

110
00:03:50,616 --> 00:03:52,576
- so they called me.
- Okay.

111
00:03:52,577 --> 00:03:54,035
Can I help?

112
00:03:54,036 --> 00:03:55,036
No, unfortunately, this is OB.

113
00:03:55,037 --> 00:03:56,413
- Hannah.
- Yeah.

114
00:03:56,414 --> 00:03:58,457
Kaitlin Neeley, 15 weeks, water broke.

115
00:03:58,458 --> 00:03:59,875
White blood count is high.

116
00:03:59,876 --> 00:04:01,251
This is her husband, Eric.

117
00:04:01,252 --> 00:04:03,086
All right, Maggie, start a second IV.

118
00:04:03,087 --> 00:04:04,755
- You got it, Doc.
- Did they perform a D&E?

119
00:04:04,756 --> 00:04:06,298
No, the doctor said they had to wait

120
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:07,716
for her to pass the remains on her own.

121
00:04:07,717 --> 00:04:10,927
Okay, CBC, CMP, lactate,
and blood cultures.

122
00:04:10,928 --> 00:04:12,721
Oh, honey!

123
00:04:12,722 --> 00:04:14,222
Honey!

124
00:04:14,223 --> 00:04:15,599
I need to start your wife
on antibiotics immediately.

125
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,933
Do you know if she's allergic to any?

126
00:04:16,934 --> 00:04:18,310
- She isn't.
- Okay.

127
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:20,812
Triple up... ampicillin,
clindamycin, gentamicin.

128
00:04:20,813 --> 00:04:21,855
Copy that.

129
00:04:21,856 --> 00:04:22,939
Your wife is very sick,

130
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,460
but we're gonna take good care of her.

131
00:04:36,514 --> 00:04:38,865
She's been carrying fetal
remains for two weeks.

132
00:04:38,867 --> 00:04:40,767
Oh, my God. And she couldn't get a D&E?

133
00:04:40,768 --> 00:04:42,394
No, her doctor wouldn't do it.

134
00:04:42,395 --> 00:04:44,021
Why?

135
00:04:47,151 --> 00:04:48,441
How's our patient?

136
00:04:48,442 --> 00:04:49,484
Better.

137
00:04:49,485 --> 00:04:51,736
Temp's come up to 95.

138
00:04:51,737 --> 00:04:53,030
How is his cognition?

139
00:04:56,459 --> 00:04:57,919
Sir.

140
00:05:00,123 --> 00:05:02,162
Can you tell us your name?

141
00:05:02,164 --> 00:05:04,290
Jimmy.

142
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:05,709
Did you hurt yourself?

143
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,086
- Maybe hit your head?
- No.

144
00:05:08,087 --> 00:05:09,212
Betty.

145
00:05:09,213 --> 00:05:10,797
Who's Betty?

146
00:05:10,798 --> 00:05:12,382
My sister.

147
00:05:12,383 --> 00:05:15,301
No ID, but he had this
Post-it in his pocket.

148
00:05:15,302 --> 00:05:16,636
It's a telephone number.

149
00:05:16,637 --> 00:05:18,513
What happened to Betty? Where is she?

150
00:05:18,514 --> 00:05:21,182
Home. She got sick.

151
00:05:21,183 --> 00:05:24,102
Get Dr. Sorensen.

152
00:05:24,103 --> 00:05:25,895
Is... is that her doctor or your doctor?

153
00:05:25,896 --> 00:05:28,606
Dr. Sorensen.

154
00:05:28,607 --> 00:05:30,025
Does he work at this hospital?

155
00:05:30,026 --> 00:05:32,360
- Yes, here.
- Okay.

156
00:05:32,361 --> 00:05:34,612
Okay, see if you can
find this Dr. Sorensen

157
00:05:34,613 --> 00:05:35,865
and try that number.

158
00:05:39,493 --> 00:05:41,077
We're gonna take good
care of you, Jimmy.

159
00:05:41,078 --> 00:05:41,870
Okay?

160
00:05:41,871 --> 00:05:43,831
Oh, thank you.

161
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,464
Dr. Charles?

162
00:05:52,465 --> 00:05:54,674
I've got an elderly patient,

163
00:05:54,675 --> 00:05:56,468
severely hypothermic.

164
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:59,429
No visible injuries, um,

165
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,181
but he's pretty out of it.

166
00:06:01,182 --> 00:06:03,224
No ID other than a phone number.

167
00:06:03,225 --> 00:06:06,102
I'm thinking he's got
dementia or maybe wandered away

168
00:06:06,103 --> 00:06:08,271
- from a care facility.
- Oh.

169
00:06:08,272 --> 00:06:09,647
You wanna give me your take?

170
00:06:09,648 --> 00:06:11,483
Sure.

171
00:06:11,484 --> 00:06:13,401
His name's Jimmy.

172
00:06:13,402 --> 00:06:15,528
Shoot me his chart.
Give me a couple minutes.

173
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:17,364
Yeah.

174
00:06:17,365 --> 00:06:20,408
Hi, Alex. Mr. and Mrs. Foster.

175
00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:21,993
This is Dr. Marcel.
He's one of our surgeons.

176
00:06:21,994 --> 00:06:23,578
I've asked him to consult.

177
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:25,372
Surgeon? Why?

178
00:06:25,373 --> 00:06:28,541
Well, Radiology said that
Alex's CT was equivocal,

179
00:06:28,542 --> 00:06:30,960
meaning it was inconclusive.

180
00:06:30,961 --> 00:06:34,506
But what it did show is
a possible appendicitis.

181
00:06:34,507 --> 00:06:38,385
And from my experience, with
Alex's elevated heart rate

182
00:06:38,386 --> 00:06:39,427
and loss of appetite,

183
00:06:39,428 --> 00:06:41,096
I believe that is, indeed, the case.

184
00:06:41,097 --> 00:06:43,014
So I'd like to operate.

185
00:06:43,015 --> 00:06:44,849
Wait, so you're not
sure it's appendicitis?

186
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,059
No.

187
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,560
Why do I have to have an operation?

188
00:06:47,561 --> 00:06:50,313
Because if it is appendicitis
and your appendix bursts,

189
00:06:50,314 --> 00:06:52,816
that would put you at risk
of an infection in the belly,

190
00:06:52,817 --> 00:06:55,402
and that could be life-threatening.

191
00:06:55,403 --> 00:06:57,153
Oh.

192
00:06:57,154 --> 00:06:59,447
But we can avoid that
with a minimally invasive

193
00:06:59,448 --> 00:07:02,200
laparoscopic surgery done with a camera

194
00:07:02,201 --> 00:07:04,202
through several small incisions...

195
00:07:04,203 --> 00:07:06,204
what we call a Band-Aid surgery.

196
00:07:06,205 --> 00:07:07,747
I agree with Dr. Marcel.

197
00:07:07,748 --> 00:07:11,751
A laparoscopic appendectomy
is the best course of action.

198
00:07:11,752 --> 00:07:13,392
Most likely, he'd be
done in half an hour.

199
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,090
Mom? Dad?

200
00:07:19,635 --> 00:07:21,344
Yeah, okay.

201
00:07:21,345 --> 00:07:22,929
Okay.

202
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,139
- All right.
- Thank you.

203
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,640
I'll see you after.

204
00:07:25,641 --> 00:07:26,766
- All right.
- Thank you.

205
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:29,310
Thank you.

206
00:07:29,311 --> 00:07:31,772
- You okay?
- It'll be fine. Mm-hmm.

207
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:38,778
Is she doing any better?

208
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:40,947
About the same.

209
00:07:40,948 --> 00:07:42,282
You know, I don't have
any more flights today,

210
00:07:42,283 --> 00:07:43,867
so I think I'll stick
around, if you don't mind.

211
00:07:43,868 --> 00:07:45,368
Mm.

212
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:48,830
Maybe I can give Eric
some moral support.

213
00:07:48,831 --> 00:07:50,041
That's a good idea.

214
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:54,294
Are you gonna do that operation?

215
00:07:54,295 --> 00:07:57,464
I recommend we try to
induce instead of a D&E.

216
00:07:57,465 --> 00:08:00,926
Surgery can be much
riskier if she's septic.

217
00:08:03,429 --> 00:08:06,056
Tell me what happened.

218
00:08:06,057 --> 00:08:07,599
Kaitlin's water broke.

219
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,518
Everybody said the fetus
couldn't survive at 15 weeks,

220
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:12,312
but it was still alive,

221
00:08:12,313 --> 00:08:16,816
so doctors were afraid to do the D&E.

222
00:08:16,817 --> 00:08:18,110
She didn't wanna get arrested.

223
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:22,781
Where we live, that could happen.

224
00:08:22,782 --> 00:08:24,908
They sent us home.

225
00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:26,993
Kaitlin got sicker and sicker.

226
00:08:26,994 --> 00:08:28,953
And I kept calling,
and they kept telling me

227
00:08:28,954 --> 00:08:32,165
it wasn't a life-threatening emergency.

228
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:35,710
Finally, I just gave up
and started driving here.

229
00:08:35,711 --> 00:08:37,754
Kaitlin's from Chicago.

230
00:08:37,755 --> 00:08:41,265
When we got married, we
moved to my family's farm,

231
00:08:41,266 --> 00:08:43,718
where I grew up.

232
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:47,098
We were so excited when
Kaitlin finally got pregnant.

233
00:08:49,517 --> 00:08:53,104
She's been so worried she's
not gonna be able to again.

234
00:08:55,022 --> 00:08:58,692
Eric, I'm gonna do the best that I can.

235
00:08:58,693 --> 00:09:01,945
But I don't know.

236
00:09:01,946 --> 00:09:03,146
I don't know.

237
00:09:11,622 --> 00:09:13,623
Okay, staple line looks good.

238
00:09:13,624 --> 00:09:14,959
No bleeding.

239
00:09:17,586 --> 00:09:19,463
Nice and easy.

240
00:09:24,802 --> 00:09:26,344
Appendix is in the bag.

241
00:09:26,345 --> 00:09:28,680
Gently wiggle the bag circularly,

242
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:30,891
and then pull it up and out.

243
00:09:34,812 --> 00:09:36,012
Hold on.

244
00:09:39,108 --> 00:09:41,568
This feels unusual.

245
00:09:41,569 --> 00:09:44,113
Go ahead and send that for a
stat frozen section, please.

246
00:09:53,581 --> 00:09:56,082
Definitely some cognitive impairment,

247
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,792
though I'm not quite sure why.

248
00:09:57,793 --> 00:10:01,254
Tox screen's negative,
no sign of head trauma.

249
00:10:01,255 --> 00:10:03,465
The childlike affect, it's
not what you normally see

250
00:10:03,466 --> 00:10:05,759
with Alzheimer's or vascular dementia,

251
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,385
though you can't rule it out.

252
00:10:07,386 --> 00:10:11,264
I'm thinking some kind
of intellectual deficit.

253
00:10:11,265 --> 00:10:13,099
So I'm thinking we should get a head CT.

254
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,392
Definitely.

255
00:10:14,393 --> 00:10:16,061
We have no more information on the guy?

256
00:10:16,062 --> 00:10:17,270
You reach out to CPD?

257
00:10:17,271 --> 00:10:18,855
Yeah, there's no missing persons

258
00:10:18,856 --> 00:10:21,399
matching his description, and
no one's come looking for him.

259
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,194
He can't stop talking about
his sister, Betty, right,

260
00:10:24,195 --> 00:10:26,738
how he is just very concerned about her.

261
00:10:26,739 --> 00:10:28,365
She's sick. She needs our help.

262
00:10:28,366 --> 00:10:29,866
Yeah, but given his mental state,

263
00:10:29,867 --> 00:10:31,576
is that even a real person?

264
00:10:31,577 --> 00:10:33,244
You know, maybe it's
someone from his childhood

265
00:10:33,245 --> 00:10:35,455
- or a show he saw on TV.
- Yeah.

266
00:10:35,456 --> 00:10:37,165
I tried the number he had again...

267
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:38,333
still no answer.

268
00:10:38,334 --> 00:10:40,794
- I left another message.
- Okay.

269
00:10:40,795 --> 00:10:43,296
Let's say that is actually
Betty's number, right?

270
00:10:43,297 --> 00:10:45,131
Maybe she's not answering
because she can't

271
00:10:45,132 --> 00:10:48,134
because she is, in fact, incapacitated.

272
00:10:48,135 --> 00:10:51,262
How about we ask CPD
to run a reverse trace?

273
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,056
That way, at least,
we'll get an address.

274
00:10:53,057 --> 00:10:54,257
Okay.

275
00:11:03,651 --> 00:11:05,777
Dr. Archer, incoming.

276
00:11:05,778 --> 00:11:06,861
You're going to trauma four.

277
00:11:06,862 --> 00:11:08,154
Damon Adams, 28,

278
00:11:08,155 --> 00:11:10,907
shortness of breath, diaphoretic.

279
00:11:10,908 --> 00:11:13,618
BP 130/90, heart rate 125. Sats 89.

280
00:11:13,619 --> 00:11:15,829
- Need help.
- It's right there.

281
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,205
Sean.

282
00:11:17,206 --> 00:11:18,289
He lives at the center where I work.

283
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:21,000
I've been counseling him.

284
00:11:21,001 --> 00:11:22,836
All right, wait here.

285
00:11:22,837 --> 00:11:24,963
All right, on my count. Ready?

286
00:11:24,964 --> 00:11:27,383
We good? One, two, three.

287
00:11:29,093 --> 00:11:30,635
All right, Damon, I'm Dr. Archer.

288
00:11:30,636 --> 00:11:31,469
What's going on?

289
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,638
- Real sick.
- Yeah?

290
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:34,597
When did this start?

291
00:11:34,598 --> 00:11:37,225
A couple days ago.

292
00:11:37,226 --> 00:11:38,560
- I can't catch my breath.
- Well, we can help you.

293
00:11:38,561 --> 00:11:40,186
Come on, let's get him up here.

294
00:11:40,187 --> 00:11:42,856
Lift him up. Start him on 100% O2.

295
00:11:42,857 --> 00:11:44,107
AP chest stat.

296
00:11:44,108 --> 00:11:47,528
I need a CBC, BNP, and an ABG.

297
00:11:49,864 --> 00:11:52,866
- X-ray.
- Clear.

298
00:11:52,867 --> 00:11:54,325
Pulmonary edema.

299
00:11:54,326 --> 00:11:56,494
Fluid in the lungs.

300
00:11:56,495 --> 00:11:58,288
Call Cardiology for a stat echo.

301
00:11:58,289 --> 00:12:01,041
Yeah, got it.

302
00:12:01,042 --> 00:12:03,001
Okay.

303
00:12:03,002 --> 00:12:04,211
Better?

304
00:12:05,713 --> 00:12:07,798
You okay if I share
some things with Sean?

305
00:12:09,341 --> 00:12:10,801
All right, I'll check back soon.

306
00:12:13,137 --> 00:12:16,056
So...

307
00:12:16,057 --> 00:12:17,557
Your friend's in pretty bad shape.

308
00:12:17,558 --> 00:12:20,810
Pulmonary edema suggests
that he's in heart failure.

309
00:12:20,811 --> 00:12:22,604
We shouldn't be seeing
that in somebody so young.

310
00:12:22,605 --> 00:12:24,606
Oh, man.

311
00:12:24,607 --> 00:12:27,233
You say that he's living
at the rehab center.

312
00:12:27,234 --> 00:12:28,693
- Is he an addict?
- Recovering,

313
00:12:28,694 --> 00:12:30,612
but I'm pretty sure he's
clean. We talk a lot.

314
00:12:30,613 --> 00:12:32,238
He's really been working the program.

315
00:12:32,239 --> 00:12:34,574
It's possible whatever's going on

316
00:12:34,575 --> 00:12:35,700
with his heart might
have something to do

317
00:12:35,701 --> 00:12:37,369
with IV drug use.

318
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:38,745
Well, you'll be able to help him, right?

319
00:12:38,746 --> 00:12:40,413
I'll do what I can, but
you need to understand,

320
00:12:40,414 --> 00:12:43,958
Sean, his condition is serious.

321
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:47,295
Well, if anybody can
help him, you can, Dad.

322
00:12:47,296 --> 00:12:49,048
I know you can.

323
00:12:58,004 --> 00:12:59,421
Is Alex all right?

324
00:12:59,423 --> 00:13:02,119
- Yes.
- He handled the surgery like a champ.

325
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,496
And it's a good thing
you brought him in.

326
00:13:03,497 --> 00:13:05,080
His appendix really needed to come out.

327
00:13:05,081 --> 00:13:08,584
Yeah, the pathology report showed
a contained appendiceal cancer.

328
00:13:08,585 --> 00:13:09,877
- Cancer?
- Cancer?

329
00:13:09,878 --> 00:13:11,295
Wait, he's only 15.

330
00:13:11,296 --> 00:13:12,588
No need to worry.

331
00:13:12,589 --> 00:13:14,965
It was small, just one
centimeter, and we got it all.

332
00:13:14,966 --> 00:13:16,675
Good thing he was wearing that watch.

333
00:13:16,676 --> 00:13:17,927
Oh.

334
00:13:17,928 --> 00:13:19,428
Wow.

335
00:13:19,429 --> 00:13:21,347
And we don't need to
talk to an oncologist?

336
00:13:21,348 --> 00:13:23,015
Well, when you come
back for a follow-up,

337
00:13:23,016 --> 00:13:24,600
we could talk about that.

338
00:13:24,601 --> 00:13:27,019
But the treatment is to remove
the appendix, and we did that.

339
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,069
Mm, okay.

340
00:13:29,071 --> 00:13:31,197
- When can we see Alex?
- Now.

341
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:33,275
Dr. Ahmad will take you to recovery.

342
00:13:33,276 --> 00:13:34,401
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

343
00:13:34,402 --> 00:13:36,111
You got it.

344
00:13:36,112 --> 00:13:39,532
No, no, no, no, I'm just here
to have my knee looked at.

345
00:13:39,533 --> 00:13:41,492
When was the last time
you had a physical, Bert?

346
00:13:41,493 --> 00:13:42,618
I don't know.

347
00:13:42,619 --> 00:13:44,119
They did some scans when I was here.

348
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,955
That is not a physical.

349
00:13:45,956 --> 00:13:47,039
You're already here.

350
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,499
The doctor will make it quick.

351
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,085
Daniel will come in and say hello.

352
00:13:51,086 --> 00:13:53,712
You owe it to your
children and your grandson

353
00:13:53,713 --> 00:13:56,966
to look after your health.

354
00:13:56,967 --> 00:13:59,301
All right. All right.

355
00:13:59,302 --> 00:14:01,887
Thank you.

356
00:14:01,888 --> 00:14:04,056
I'm seeing pericardial effusion.

357
00:14:04,057 --> 00:14:05,975
That means that there's
a buildup of fluid

358
00:14:05,976 --> 00:14:07,810
in the sac around the
heart, and that puts pressure

359
00:14:07,811 --> 00:14:10,980
on the heart so that it
doesn't pump effectively.

360
00:14:10,981 --> 00:14:12,648
Would you please let me
know when the attending

361
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:14,024
- has looked at this?
- You got it.

362
00:14:14,025 --> 00:14:14,984
Okay.

363
00:14:14,985 --> 00:14:17,528
So I'm not sure what's going on.

364
00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:19,446
So I'm gonna start you on antibiotics,

365
00:14:19,447 --> 00:14:21,448
in case it's a bacterial infection.

366
00:14:21,449 --> 00:14:23,534
We're gonna treat the
pericardial effusion

367
00:14:23,535 --> 00:14:25,870
with steroids and anti-inflammatories.

368
00:14:25,871 --> 00:14:27,371
Sats are at 83,

369
00:14:27,372 --> 00:14:28,874
and blood pressure's dropping.

370
00:14:31,168 --> 00:14:32,368
Dad?

371
00:14:34,296 --> 00:14:37,131
Okay, I think we need to put you
on a machine that breathes for you.

372
00:14:37,132 --> 00:14:38,466
- Okay.
- All right?

373
00:14:38,467 --> 00:14:39,633
In order to do that, we
need to put you to sleep.

374
00:14:39,634 --> 00:14:41,844
Is that all right?

375
00:14:41,845 --> 00:14:42,845
All right.

376
00:14:42,846 --> 00:14:44,638
Call respiratory.

377
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,016
All right, 20 of
etomidate and 100 of sux.

378
00:14:47,017 --> 00:14:48,894
On its way.

379
00:15:00,614 --> 00:15:03,032
Okay, I'm in.

380
00:15:03,033 --> 00:15:04,493
Bag him.

381
00:15:07,871 --> 00:15:09,789
All right, this will let his body rest,

382
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,583
and hopefully, it'll help push
the fluid out of his lungs.

383
00:15:12,584 --> 00:15:13,834
Thanks, Dad.

384
00:15:13,835 --> 00:15:15,419
Put a foley in, and let's start him

385
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,757
on 125 milligrams of Solumedrol
and 10 milligrams of Lasix.

386
00:15:19,758 --> 00:15:22,886
We won't see any changes for
a while, so I'll check back.

387
00:15:24,596 --> 00:15:26,722
- Dr. Archer.
- Yeah?

388
00:15:26,723 --> 00:15:28,557
- Have you got a minute?
- Yeah.

389
00:15:28,558 --> 00:15:33,312
My ex-husband, Bert, is here
for a follow-up on a knee injury.

390
00:15:33,313 --> 00:15:35,105
He hasn't had a physical in ages,

391
00:15:35,106 --> 00:15:37,858
and he has finally agreed to get one.

392
00:15:37,859 --> 00:15:40,694
Would you mind giving
him a quick look-see?

393
00:15:40,695 --> 00:15:42,112
- Just the basics.
- No problem.

394
00:15:42,113 --> 00:15:43,239
He's in two.

395
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,075
Oh, and um, Dr. Charles,

396
00:15:46,076 --> 00:15:47,409
he might stop by.

397
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:48,744
He and Bert are old friends.

398
00:15:48,745 --> 00:15:49,954
- Okay.
- Thank you.

399
00:15:49,955 --> 00:15:51,914
Sure.

400
00:15:51,915 --> 00:15:53,624
Hey, Nancy?

401
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,960
- Is Jimmy's CT back?
- Not yet.

402
00:15:55,961 --> 00:15:58,838
Uh, how's CPD doing
on that reverse trace?

403
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:00,256
They have an address.

404
00:16:00,257 --> 00:16:01,507
They're sending a car over now.

405
00:16:01,508 --> 00:16:03,467
I hope they find a contact.

406
00:16:03,468 --> 00:16:06,178
Jimmy started running a fever
and his chest is congested.

407
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:09,098
I put him on antibiotics
in case of pneumonia.

408
00:16:09,099 --> 00:16:10,808
Listen, I don't know
if this means anything,

409
00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:15,688
but I did, in the archives, find
a Dr. Sorensen who worked here.

410
00:16:15,689 --> 00:16:17,439
Great, can we... can we get in touch?

411
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,150
Unfortunately, no.

412
00:16:19,151 --> 00:16:20,569
He died 50 years ago.

413
00:16:25,574 --> 00:16:28,034
Well, he's not gonna be any help.

414
00:16:31,663 --> 00:16:33,122
How long is this gonna take?

415
00:16:33,123 --> 00:16:34,958
Longer if you don't keep still.

416
00:16:36,334 --> 00:16:39,670
I heard I had an old pal
in here, making trouble.

417
00:16:39,671 --> 00:16:41,922
Sharon twisted my arm.

418
00:16:41,923 --> 00:16:43,549
How we doing? Where are you guys at?

419
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,468
I took his vitals, got blood.

420
00:16:45,469 --> 00:16:47,303
Treated me like a pincushion.

421
00:16:47,304 --> 00:16:48,762
I have a proposal for you.

422
00:16:48,763 --> 00:16:51,140
What do you say I take
over before this old crank

423
00:16:51,141 --> 00:16:52,433
bites your head off?

424
00:16:52,434 --> 00:16:54,561
I will absolutely take
you up on your offer.

425
00:16:58,023 --> 00:16:59,315
Okay.

426
00:16:59,316 --> 00:17:02,276
Let us see what we have here.

427
00:17:02,277 --> 00:17:04,571
Uh, look up for me, buddy.

428
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,017
So you know we've got
Celtics-Bulls tomorrow night, right?

429
00:17:09,018 --> 00:17:10,056
Right.

430
00:17:10,057 --> 00:17:12,828
I was actually thinking about
putting down a little action.

431
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:15,039
- You? Action?
- Why not?

432
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,791
Celtics heavily favored,
all right, but I'm just...

433
00:17:16,792 --> 00:17:19,001
I'm really feeling the upset.

434
00:17:19,002 --> 00:17:22,338
If I take the Bulls, I get 6-to-1 odds.

435
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:23,631
Hmm.

436
00:17:23,632 --> 00:17:25,841
Yeah?

437
00:17:25,842 --> 00:17:29,553
Okay, now follow with
your eyes, not your head.

438
00:17:29,554 --> 00:17:31,515
Here you go.

439
00:17:32,933 --> 00:17:38,103
So if I put down 20 bucks,

440
00:17:38,104 --> 00:17:39,313
that would get me,

441
00:17:39,314 --> 00:17:41,232
when it's 6 to 1 odds,
that would get me...

442
00:17:41,233 --> 00:17:43,693
Uh, 110?

443
00:17:45,362 --> 00:17:46,362
120, isn't it?

444
00:17:46,363 --> 00:17:47,404
I think it's 120, yeah.

445
00:17:47,405 --> 00:17:49,658
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, 120.

446
00:17:50,784 --> 00:17:52,284
Not bad, huh?

447
00:17:52,285 --> 00:17:54,370
No. No, not bad.

448
00:17:54,371 --> 00:17:56,038
Mm.

449
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:58,874
You know, we haven't
been to Al's for a while.

450
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,292
You wanna grab some lunch on Friday?

451
00:18:00,293 --> 00:18:02,002
You got it.

452
00:18:02,003 --> 00:18:03,203
Okay.

453
00:18:08,426 --> 00:18:10,679
Hey, Alex. Can you hear me?

454
00:18:12,848 --> 00:18:14,048
Can you open your eyes for me?

455
00:18:16,393 --> 00:18:18,561
Can you squeeze my hand for me?

456
00:18:18,562 --> 00:18:20,896
Can you do that?

457
00:18:20,897 --> 00:18:22,398
Is something wrong?

458
00:18:22,399 --> 00:18:25,109
No, his body is just
taking longer than expected

459
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:27,069
to clear the muscle
relaxant that we gave him,

460
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,237
which was part of the anesthetic.

461
00:18:28,238 --> 00:18:29,613
Is that a problem?

462
00:18:29,614 --> 00:18:31,532
No, we can give Alex a
medication that will help

463
00:18:31,533 --> 00:18:34,126
reverse the muscle relaxant
and help him come back to us

464
00:18:34,127 --> 00:18:35,151
a little bit faster.

465
00:18:35,152 --> 00:18:37,746
- We do this all the time.
- Okay.

466
00:18:37,747 --> 00:18:40,291
Let's give him 0.2 of Exsomadex.

467
00:18:40,292 --> 00:18:41,333
On its way.

468
00:18:41,334 --> 00:18:43,879
This should act fast.

469
00:18:47,507 --> 00:18:49,258
Sinus tachycardia.

470
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:50,759
BP 80/50.

471
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,178
Oh, what's happening to him?

472
00:18:52,179 --> 00:18:53,304
Let's get him upright.

473
00:18:53,305 --> 00:18:54,972
He's having an anaphylactoid reaction,

474
00:18:54,973 --> 00:18:56,265
which is like an allergic reaction.

475
00:18:56,266 --> 00:18:58,267
Oh, God!

476
00:18:58,268 --> 00:18:59,602
Epi 0.3 milligrams IM.

477
00:18:59,603 --> 00:19:00,811
On its way.

478
00:19:00,812 --> 00:19:02,104
You said you do this all the time.

479
00:19:02,105 --> 00:19:03,439
We do.

480
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,774
BP now 72/45.

481
00:19:05,775 --> 00:19:09,236
Solumedrol 125, diphenhydramine 50,

482
00:19:09,237 --> 00:19:10,821
Famotidine 20.

483
00:19:10,822 --> 00:19:12,615
Oh, my God. My baby.

484
00:19:12,616 --> 00:19:14,284
Oh, my baby.

485
00:19:17,621 --> 00:19:19,121
Okay, BP's coming up.

486
00:19:19,122 --> 00:19:22,124
87/55.

487
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,293
93/60.

488
00:19:24,294 --> 00:19:25,796
Oh.

489
00:19:28,465 --> 00:19:29,799
He's gonna be okay.

490
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,758
Really, he's gonna be fine.

491
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:32,468
But why?

492
00:19:32,469 --> 00:19:34,179
Why did this happen?

493
00:19:39,684 --> 00:19:41,936
Dr. Asher, we need you in here.

494
00:19:41,937 --> 00:19:44,814
Her BP keeps dropping.

495
00:19:44,815 --> 00:19:47,442
Okay, up her Levophed to 20.

496
00:19:48,652 --> 00:19:50,736
Oh, God! Oh, God!

497
00:19:50,737 --> 00:19:52,739
Brisk VB.

498
00:19:55,408 --> 00:19:57,034
- She's not dilating.
- What does that mean?

499
00:19:57,035 --> 00:19:59,537
It means that the medication
we used to induce labor

500
00:19:59,538 --> 00:20:00,621
isn't working fast enough.

501
00:20:00,622 --> 00:20:01,956
BP's still low.

502
00:20:01,957 --> 00:20:03,666
Transfuse 2 of red and 2 of plasma.

503
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:04,917
Call for 6 and 6.

504
00:20:04,918 --> 00:20:06,293
We need to operate now.

505
00:20:06,294 --> 00:20:07,837
You said it was risky
while she was septic.

506
00:20:07,838 --> 00:20:09,338
We can't wait. Call the OR.

507
00:20:09,339 --> 00:20:11,716
Let them know we're coming
up for an emergent D&E.

508
00:20:18,306 --> 00:20:19,473
Don't let her die.

509
00:20:19,475 --> 00:20:21,102
Please don't let her die.

510
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,183
Can I ask you for a
little favor? All right?

511
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,161
Just because your blood
pressure is a little high,

512
00:20:30,163 --> 00:20:31,913
do you mind hanging around

513
00:20:31,914 --> 00:20:32,956
till I get your blood work back?

514
00:20:32,957 --> 00:20:34,416
Just for my own peace of mind.

515
00:20:34,417 --> 00:20:36,626
Go to the café. Have
a nice cup of coffee.

516
00:20:36,627 --> 00:20:38,044
It won't be long.

517
00:20:38,045 --> 00:20:39,395
I'll text you one way or the other.

518
00:20:39,396 --> 00:20:40,756
Okay.

519
00:20:40,757 --> 00:20:43,008
Looking forward to Friday.

520
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:44,926
Friday?

521
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,595
Lunch. Lunch at Al's.

522
00:20:46,596 --> 00:20:48,764
- 1:00.
- Right.

523
00:20:48,765 --> 00:20:50,932
Right. Lunch at Al's.

524
00:20:50,933 --> 00:20:52,976
1:00. See you, Dan.

525
00:20:52,977 --> 00:20:54,896
See you, pal.

526
00:21:00,777 --> 00:21:01,977
Give me suction.

527
00:21:05,239 --> 00:21:07,574
Marty, how's she looking?

528
00:21:07,575 --> 00:21:10,202
BP's better than pre-op, 100/60.

529
00:21:10,203 --> 00:21:11,453
Good.

530
00:21:11,454 --> 00:21:13,164
Good, good, good, good.

531
00:21:14,332 --> 00:21:16,541
Uterus feels clear.

532
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:18,418
Marty, how much IVF did she get?

533
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:23,006
2 liters of NS, 2 PRBC, 2 of plasma.

534
00:21:23,007 --> 00:21:24,549
Urine output is at 300 CC...

535
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,426
Dr. Asher.

536
00:21:26,427 --> 00:21:28,804
She's hemorrhaging!

537
00:21:28,805 --> 00:21:31,473
BP 70/30, heart rate 150.

538
00:21:31,474 --> 00:21:33,433
Start the MTP and give her 1 gram TXA,

539
00:21:33,434 --> 00:21:36,603
0.2 milligrams methergine
IM now and 1,000 misoprostol.

540
00:21:36,604 --> 00:21:38,772
- Should we open?
- No, get me a Bakri balloon.

541
00:21:38,773 --> 00:21:39,973
Retractor.

542
00:21:44,153 --> 00:21:46,280
Inflating.

543
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:48,657
The bleeding's slowing.

544
00:21:48,658 --> 00:21:50,076
BP coming up.

545
00:22:02,088 --> 00:22:03,713
How's he doing?

546
00:22:03,714 --> 00:22:04,965
Not great.

547
00:22:04,966 --> 00:22:06,758
He feels helpless.

548
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:08,385
Is she gonna be able to keep her uterus?

549
00:22:08,386 --> 00:22:10,178
I don't know.

550
00:22:10,179 --> 00:22:12,556
Right now, it's all
about saving her life.

551
00:22:12,557 --> 00:22:14,142
Yeah.

552
00:22:16,978 --> 00:22:18,186
So you have kids?

553
00:22:18,187 --> 00:22:19,271
One.

554
00:22:19,272 --> 00:22:21,231
She's grown.

555
00:22:21,232 --> 00:22:23,483
My ex and I, we tried to adopt,

556
00:22:23,484 --> 00:22:27,154
but it didn't work out.

557
00:22:27,155 --> 00:22:28,697
What about you?

558
00:22:28,698 --> 00:22:29,948
No.

559
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:31,491
No, I, um...

560
00:22:31,492 --> 00:22:33,410
I was married young

561
00:22:33,411 --> 00:22:34,786
before I went into the service.

562
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:37,539
And after I got back from deployment,

563
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:41,793
we both agreed that
there was nothing there.

564
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:44,171
It's all so hard.

565
00:22:44,172 --> 00:22:46,299
And to have this?

566
00:22:52,847 --> 00:22:54,014
Dr. Ripley.

567
00:22:54,015 --> 00:22:55,182
Yeah.

568
00:22:55,183 --> 00:22:57,350
Jimmy's CT.

569
00:22:57,351 --> 00:22:59,770
It doesn't look like
Alzheimer's, does it?

570
00:22:59,771 --> 00:23:00,896
No.

571
00:23:00,897 --> 00:23:03,482
No, brain's not globally atrophied.

572
00:23:03,483 --> 00:23:07,152
It looks like a lot of
scarring in the frontal area.

573
00:23:07,153 --> 00:23:08,528
Yeah.

574
00:23:08,529 --> 00:23:10,823
So traumatic brain injury?

575
00:23:17,205 --> 00:23:19,790
In a manner of speaking.

576
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:22,460
I read about this in medical school.

577
00:23:25,755 --> 00:23:27,881
Dr. Charles.

578
00:23:27,882 --> 00:23:29,007
Hey.

579
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:31,176
So what do you think?

580
00:23:31,177 --> 00:23:35,555
I think that we could be
looking at some issues.

581
00:23:35,556 --> 00:23:39,017
So he's gonna need a thorough workup.

582
00:23:39,018 --> 00:23:40,310
It's a good idea.

583
00:23:40,311 --> 00:23:44,481
Convincing him is not gonna be easy.

584
00:23:44,482 --> 00:23:46,066
Help me out with that?

585
00:23:46,067 --> 00:23:48,527
Actually, I made up a
little excuse about his labs

586
00:23:48,528 --> 00:23:51,238
in order to keep him here.

587
00:23:51,239 --> 00:23:53,323
Tell him together after I get him back?

588
00:23:53,324 --> 00:23:54,825
Text me.

589
00:23:54,826 --> 00:23:56,026
Thanks.

590
00:24:05,294 --> 00:24:07,379
- How's the kid?
- He's fine.

591
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,672
It was scary.

592
00:24:08,673 --> 00:24:10,132
Yeah.

593
00:24:10,133 --> 00:24:12,134
I think the hospital
should pull Exsomadex.

594
00:24:12,135 --> 00:24:14,344
Whoa. Why?

595
00:24:14,345 --> 00:24:15,887
The anaphylactic reaction happened

596
00:24:15,888 --> 00:24:17,139
after we administered it.

597
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,141
Temporal connection
doesn't mean anything.

598
00:24:19,142 --> 00:24:20,767
That kid's on 15 other medications.

599
00:24:20,768 --> 00:24:22,644
They could have a delayed effect.

600
00:24:22,645 --> 00:24:25,105
More likely, it was the
antibiotic or the anesthetic.

601
00:24:25,106 --> 00:24:27,941
I considered that, so I pulled ADR data.

602
00:24:27,942 --> 00:24:30,610
There have been several similar
reactions to Exsomadex here.

603
00:24:30,611 --> 00:24:35,449
Get this... the manufacturer
report claims 1 out of 2,500.

604
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:38,493
Med data shows 1 out of 200.

605
00:24:38,494 --> 00:24:40,663
That's 10 times what
the manufacturer claims.

606
00:24:42,707 --> 00:24:44,249
Well, you might have a case,

607
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,293
but this data is retrospective.

608
00:24:46,294 --> 00:24:48,336
It's not any kind of clinical study.

609
00:24:48,337 --> 00:24:51,298
So pull Exsomadex until we have one.

610
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:53,675
Hold on. It's a popular medication.

611
00:24:53,676 --> 00:24:55,302
I've used it and never had a problem.

612
00:24:55,303 --> 00:24:57,637
It doesn't mean that you won't.

613
00:24:57,638 --> 00:25:03,852
Crockett, that boy almost died today.

614
00:25:03,853 --> 00:25:05,145
All right.

615
00:25:05,146 --> 00:25:06,646
I'll, uh...

616
00:25:06,647 --> 00:25:08,940
I'll bring this up at the
drug and formulary meeting.

617
00:25:08,941 --> 00:25:10,066
Best I can do for now.

618
00:25:10,067 --> 00:25:11,568
In the meantime, make
sure that the nurses

619
00:25:11,569 --> 00:25:14,404
submit an adverse drug
reaction report, okay?

620
00:25:14,405 --> 00:25:15,948
Thank you.

621
00:25:18,493 --> 00:25:20,869
To begin the transorbital lobotomy,

622
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:23,997
the orbitoclast is inserted
under the left eyelid

623
00:25:23,998 --> 00:25:26,792
and up against the
top of the eye socket.

624
00:25:26,793 --> 00:25:28,794
The neurosurgeon drives the point

625
00:25:28,795 --> 00:25:31,338
through the orbital plate
into the frontal lobe

626
00:25:31,339 --> 00:25:34,007
to a depth of 5 centimeters.

627
00:25:34,008 --> 00:25:37,010
He then swings the handle far laterally.

628
00:25:37,011 --> 00:25:40,306
He now drives the instrument
another 2 centimeters...

629
00:25:54,946 --> 00:25:56,905
Here's Jimmy's CT.

630
00:25:56,906 --> 00:26:00,408
I think we can rule out Alzheimer's.

631
00:26:00,409 --> 00:26:03,411
Identical scarring on...

632
00:26:03,412 --> 00:26:06,373
oh, my God.

633
00:26:06,374 --> 00:26:07,791
He had a lobotomy?

634
00:26:07,792 --> 00:26:10,001
Yeah.

635
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:12,546
They haven't done those
for, like, 60 years.

636
00:26:12,547 --> 00:26:14,881
I mean, he must have been a kid.

637
00:26:14,882 --> 00:26:18,009
They did the procedure
on difficult patients.

638
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:20,554
Jimmy was probably a discipline problem,

639
00:26:20,555 --> 00:26:22,013
hard to control.

640
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:26,017
So Dr. Sorensen stuck
a skewer into his brain

641
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:29,605
and... took care of that.

642
00:26:33,443 --> 00:26:35,194
Awful.

643
00:26:42,274 --> 00:26:46,014
Dad said he's getting more
oxygen now, so that's good.

644
00:26:46,541 --> 00:26:48,167
Hey. This is Dr. Collins.

645
00:26:48,168 --> 00:26:50,503
- She started our center.
- Oh, Margo. Please.

646
00:26:50,504 --> 00:26:52,088
I think I've seen you
around the hospital.

647
00:26:52,089 --> 00:26:53,381
Yeah, I recently got privileges.

648
00:26:53,382 --> 00:26:55,132
I'm sorry I couldn't get here earlier.

649
00:26:55,133 --> 00:26:56,884
Several new residents were checking in.

650
00:26:56,885 --> 00:26:58,427
So how is Damon doing?

651
00:26:58,428 --> 00:27:00,554
Well, he's sedated.
He's on a ventilator.

652
00:27:00,555 --> 00:27:02,098
Dad's been taking
really good care of him.

653
00:27:02,099 --> 00:27:03,349
I'm sure he has.

654
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,934
Well, we're by no
means out of the woods.

655
00:27:04,935 --> 00:27:06,352
Can I see his chart?

656
00:27:06,353 --> 00:27:08,521
Sure.

657
00:27:08,522 --> 00:27:10,356
Endocarditis.

658
00:27:10,357 --> 00:27:12,358
We're hoping the
antibiotics knock it out.

659
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:13,859
Listen, if you need to get back,

660
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,403
I can call you if there's a change.

661
00:27:15,404 --> 00:27:20,283
Uh, no, I'd like to
stay, see how he does.

662
00:27:20,284 --> 00:27:22,118
Is it all right if I sit with him?

663
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:24,537
- Of course.
- Thank you.

664
00:27:24,538 --> 00:27:26,414
Hey, just so you know,

665
00:27:26,415 --> 00:27:28,541
your son, he's been a real godsend.

666
00:27:28,542 --> 00:27:29,959
That's nice to hear.

667
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,003
It's so helpful to have
people around our residents

668
00:27:32,004 --> 00:27:33,964
who understand their challenges.

669
00:27:41,763 --> 00:27:43,931
Kaitlin?

670
00:27:43,932 --> 00:27:46,267
Kaitlin, can you hear me?

671
00:27:46,268 --> 00:27:48,102
Hi.

672
00:27:48,103 --> 00:27:49,895
I got good news.

673
00:27:49,896 --> 00:27:52,565
We were able to save your uterus.

674
00:27:52,566 --> 00:27:55,735
So if you decide to conceive again,

675
00:27:55,736 --> 00:27:56,936
you should be able to.

676
00:27:58,697 --> 00:28:00,781
Honey, did you hear?

677
00:28:00,782 --> 00:28:02,033
No.

678
00:28:02,034 --> 00:28:03,576
No, I can't.

679
00:28:03,577 --> 00:28:05,703
I can't do it again.

680
00:28:05,704 --> 00:28:07,747
Please. I'm sorry.

681
00:28:07,748 --> 00:28:10,041
It's okay. It's okay.

682
00:28:10,042 --> 00:28:11,334
Nobody would help.

683
00:28:11,335 --> 00:28:12,543
I know.

684
00:28:12,544 --> 00:28:16,048
They made me feel like I didn't matter.

685
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:19,717
I was thinking,

686
00:28:19,718 --> 00:28:21,636
if you agree,

687
00:28:21,637 --> 00:28:23,137
maybe we should move.

688
00:28:23,138 --> 00:28:25,014
But your home, the farm.

689
00:28:25,015 --> 00:28:26,849
I can't go back there.

690
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:28,643
How could I?

691
00:28:28,644 --> 00:28:31,646
Oh, God, Kaitlin,

692
00:28:31,647 --> 00:28:35,359
I don't think I could stand to
see you suffer like that again.

693
00:28:36,151 --> 00:28:40,071
I know how much you
wanted a family, so...

694
00:28:40,072 --> 00:28:44,325
if you decide you want us to try again,

695
00:28:44,326 --> 00:28:46,452
you don't have to be afraid.

696
00:28:46,453 --> 00:28:48,664
We'll leave you two alone.

697
00:28:53,502 --> 00:28:55,586
Well, it's good to know

698
00:28:55,587 --> 00:28:58,547
there's some good guys in the world.

699
00:28:58,548 --> 00:28:59,748
Yeah.

700
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,097
How is she?

701
00:29:14,147 --> 00:29:16,732
They're not gonna pull Exsomadex.

702
00:29:16,733 --> 00:29:18,526
They're submitting the data to the FDA,

703
00:29:18,527 --> 00:29:21,028
and they'll, uh, follow
their recommendations.

704
00:29:21,029 --> 00:29:23,531
That could take forever.

705
00:29:23,532 --> 00:29:25,366
We need to pull it
now. I'll talk to them.

706
00:29:25,367 --> 00:29:27,243
Hold on. I made the case.

707
00:29:27,244 --> 00:29:29,745
- It's been decided.
- I can still try.

708
00:29:29,746 --> 00:29:32,373
Drop it, Zola.

709
00:29:32,374 --> 00:29:35,543
It's not how things work here.

710
00:29:35,544 --> 00:29:36,878
Of course.

711
00:29:46,054 --> 00:29:48,055
You feeling better, Jimmy?

712
00:29:48,056 --> 00:29:49,265
Uh-huh.

713
00:29:49,266 --> 00:29:50,766
What about Betty?

714
00:29:50,767 --> 00:29:53,436
Dr. Ripley, CPD is here.

715
00:29:53,437 --> 00:29:55,438
I'll be back in a minute.

716
00:29:55,439 --> 00:29:58,149
- Dr. Ripley?
- Hi.

717
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:59,483
We did a well-being check on the address

718
00:29:59,484 --> 00:30:01,152
associated with that number.

719
00:30:01,153 --> 00:30:04,947
We found an elderly woman... deceased.

720
00:30:04,948 --> 00:30:06,574
Medical examiner is investigating,

721
00:30:06,575 --> 00:30:08,492
but it looks like natural causes.

722
00:30:08,493 --> 00:30:10,746
I took this off the credenza.

723
00:30:14,082 --> 00:30:15,416
That's my patient.

724
00:30:15,417 --> 00:30:17,084
And that's the woman we found.

725
00:30:17,085 --> 00:30:19,420
I talked to a neighbor who said
they were brother and sister.

726
00:30:19,421 --> 00:30:22,089
And she was her brother's caregiver.

727
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:25,259
Sorry I don't have better news.

728
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,427
She must have collapsed,

729
00:30:26,428 --> 00:30:28,597
and Jimmy went looking for help.

730
00:30:32,893 --> 00:30:34,769
Better call social work.

731
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:35,970
He's not going home.

732
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:48,783
I thought you'd be more
comfortable waiting in here.

733
00:30:48,784 --> 00:30:51,535
I haven't been in your
office for a long time.

734
00:30:51,536 --> 00:30:52,703
Very nice.

735
00:30:52,704 --> 00:30:54,956
Please. Can I get you anything?

736
00:30:54,957 --> 00:30:56,916
Nah.

737
00:30:56,917 --> 00:30:59,627
- Come on in.
- Daniel.

738
00:30:59,628 --> 00:31:00,962
Go ahead.

739
00:31:00,963 --> 00:31:03,214
Tell her what great shape I'm in.

740
00:31:03,215 --> 00:31:04,966
Well, I mean, by and large, you are.

741
00:31:04,967 --> 00:31:07,385
There you go.

742
00:31:07,386 --> 00:31:10,137
Yeah, I noticed a...

743
00:31:10,138 --> 00:31:11,555
a minor balance issue.

744
00:31:11,556 --> 00:31:13,516
I hurt my knee. What do you expect?

745
00:31:13,517 --> 00:31:16,102
And some short-term memory issues.

746
00:31:16,103 --> 00:31:18,813
Memory?

747
00:31:18,814 --> 00:31:19,981
What do you mean?

748
00:31:19,982 --> 00:31:21,274
Well, you're forgetting things, Bert.

749
00:31:21,275 --> 00:31:23,734
Well, who doesn't forget things?

750
00:31:23,735 --> 00:31:25,279
What's this about?

751
00:31:27,155 --> 00:31:28,823
Really just about your...

752
00:31:28,824 --> 00:31:31,242
your friends and your family
being a little bit concerned.

753
00:31:31,243 --> 00:31:32,952
That's all.

754
00:31:32,953 --> 00:31:34,453
Concerned.

755
00:31:34,454 --> 00:31:37,873
We'd like you to take
some more tests, Bert.

756
00:31:37,874 --> 00:31:40,376
What tests?

757
00:31:40,377 --> 00:31:42,878
Oh, to see if I'm all
there, compos mentis.

758
00:31:42,879 --> 00:31:44,672
Is that what you're talking about?

759
00:31:44,673 --> 00:31:46,382
Well, I mean, if there is an issue...

760
00:31:46,383 --> 00:31:48,926
and trust me, big if...

761
00:31:48,927 --> 00:31:50,011
don't you wanna know?

762
00:31:50,012 --> 00:31:51,012
I mean, I certainly would.

763
00:31:51,013 --> 00:31:52,555
There isn't.

764
00:31:52,556 --> 00:31:56,100
Well, just in case, let's make an
appointment with the neurologist.

765
00:31:56,101 --> 00:31:57,143
Oh, yeah.

766
00:31:57,144 --> 00:31:58,352
I get it.

767
00:31:58,353 --> 00:31:59,687
This is a setup.

768
00:31:59,688 --> 00:32:01,188
It was a setup from the beginning.

769
00:32:01,189 --> 00:32:02,565
Look, I apologize, Bert,

770
00:32:02,566 --> 00:32:05,067
but I knew you wouldn't
come here on your own.

771
00:32:05,068 --> 00:32:07,494
And Tara has been so worried.

772
00:32:07,495 --> 00:32:09,030
Uh-uh. Don't put this on Tara.

773
00:32:09,031 --> 00:32:10,948
This is... this is you.

774
00:32:10,949 --> 00:32:12,867
Yeah, y-you're trying to put me away.

775
00:32:12,868 --> 00:32:15,620
You wanna put me away so
you can get your hands on...

776
00:32:15,621 --> 00:32:17,663
- on my... on my pension!
- Oh, Bert!

777
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,665
And... and you're in it with her.

778
00:32:19,666 --> 00:32:21,375
The two of you are
cooking up this nonsense

779
00:32:21,376 --> 00:32:23,169
so you can get my money!

780
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:24,670
Couple of crooks!

781
00:32:24,671 --> 00:32:26,839
Bert.

782
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,507
How long have we been friends for, huh?

783
00:32:28,508 --> 00:32:30,718
- 40 years?
- 40 years, but not anymore.

784
00:32:30,719 --> 00:32:32,219
A-and what was that power I gave you?

785
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,387
That law power?

786
00:32:33,388 --> 00:32:34,430
Power of attorney.

787
00:32:34,431 --> 00:32:35,431
Well, you don't have it anymore.

788
00:32:35,432 --> 00:32:36,682
You ought to be ashamed!

789
00:32:36,683 --> 00:32:38,143
Bert!

790
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:49,729
Dr. Ahmad, they discharged Alex.

791
00:32:49,731 --> 00:32:50,981
Great.

792
00:32:50,982 --> 00:32:53,984
Yeah, like you said, no big deal.

793
00:32:53,985 --> 00:32:55,068
I'm sorry for what happened.

794
00:32:55,069 --> 00:32:57,488
No. Please, it wasn't your fault.

795
00:32:57,489 --> 00:32:59,156
And Alex is doing fine.

796
00:32:59,157 --> 00:33:00,824
You caught his cancer.

797
00:33:00,825 --> 00:33:02,284
My God.

798
00:33:02,285 --> 00:33:04,454
We are so grateful
to you and Dr. Marcel.

799
00:33:06,206 --> 00:33:08,248
We can't even begin to thank you enough.

800
00:33:08,249 --> 00:33:10,125
Thank you, guys. Good luck.

801
00:33:10,126 --> 00:33:11,960
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

802
00:33:11,961 --> 00:33:13,338
Thank you.

803
00:33:17,801 --> 00:33:19,344
No pulse.

804
00:33:20,804 --> 00:33:22,012
He's fibrillating.

805
00:33:22,013 --> 00:33:23,555
I'll get on his chest.

806
00:33:23,556 --> 00:33:25,390
Milligram of epi.

807
00:33:25,391 --> 00:33:26,350
Charge to 200.

808
00:33:26,351 --> 00:33:27,518
Charging.

809
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:28,812
Clear.

810
00:33:30,688 --> 00:33:31,939
Still no pulse.

811
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,981
Epi's in.

812
00:33:32,982 --> 00:33:34,024
Again, charge to 200.

813
00:33:34,025 --> 00:33:35,442
Charging.

814
00:33:35,443 --> 00:33:37,904
Clear.

815
00:33:40,698 --> 00:33:42,825
Huh, nothing.

816
00:33:42,826 --> 00:33:44,452
He's asystole.

817
00:33:50,291 --> 00:33:53,044
No.

818
00:33:56,005 --> 00:33:58,633
Damn it.

819
00:34:01,553 --> 00:34:03,930
Time of death, 1703.

820
00:34:16,442 --> 00:34:19,487
All right, Jimmy, let's get
you into this wheelchair.

821
00:34:23,366 --> 00:34:24,993
That's it.

822
00:34:27,036 --> 00:34:28,413
Now, you see that nice woman?

823
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,959
She's gonna take you to a new home.

824
00:34:34,669 --> 00:34:37,171
Did you help Betty?

825
00:34:37,172 --> 00:34:39,382
Some very good people went to help her.

826
00:34:41,301 --> 00:34:44,471
Where I'm going, is Betty there?

827
00:34:46,764 --> 00:34:49,100
No, she isn't.

828
00:34:51,436 --> 00:34:53,271
I-I want Betty.

829
00:34:57,609 --> 00:34:59,069
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

830
00:34:59,611 --> 00:35:01,111
She can't be there.

831
00:35:01,112 --> 00:35:03,280
But she'd want you to go,

832
00:35:03,281 --> 00:35:06,700
and she'd want you to be happy.

833
00:35:06,701 --> 00:35:11,455
I... I want Betty.

834
00:35:11,456 --> 00:35:12,831
Yeah.

835
00:35:12,832 --> 00:35:16,084
Yeah, I know.

836
00:35:16,085 --> 00:35:17,879
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

837
00:35:23,635 --> 00:35:25,011
Here.

838
00:35:28,097 --> 00:35:31,350
That's Betty

839
00:35:31,351 --> 00:35:32,976
and me.

840
00:35:32,977 --> 00:35:34,177
Yeah.

841
00:35:36,815 --> 00:35:38,775
I love Betty.

842
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,324
It's gonna be all right, Jimmy.

843
00:35:47,325 --> 00:35:48,992
I'll come see you, okay?

844
00:35:48,993 --> 00:35:50,703
And we'll talk about Betty then.

845
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:56,250
I was cold.

846
00:35:56,251 --> 00:35:58,086
Now I'm warm.

847
00:36:00,004 --> 00:36:01,339
Thank you.

848
00:36:03,633 --> 00:36:04,833
You're welcome.

849
00:36:09,013 --> 00:36:10,514
Hi, Jimmy.

850
00:36:10,515 --> 00:36:12,016
I'm Madeline.

851
00:36:18,022 --> 00:36:20,817
Hi, Madeline.

852
00:36:33,204 --> 00:36:36,374
That's a... a tough one, huh?

853
00:36:38,418 --> 00:36:40,262
I just keep wondering

854
00:36:41,004 --> 00:36:44,882
what his life might have been if,

855
00:36:44,883 --> 00:36:47,134
you know...

856
00:36:47,135 --> 00:36:51,722
If they hadn't given up on him?

857
00:36:51,723 --> 00:36:53,141
Yeah.

858
00:36:54,976 --> 00:36:58,437
You know, I've been meaning to ask you,

859
00:36:58,438 --> 00:37:00,690
were you ever able to
reconnect with your mom?

860
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,650
No.

861
00:37:03,651 --> 00:37:06,028
I heard she's been in and out of rehab,

862
00:37:06,029 --> 00:37:07,738
in and out of custody.

863
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:10,115
Well,

864
00:37:10,116 --> 00:37:11,826
I'm sorry to hear that.

865
00:37:14,746 --> 00:37:18,040
And I'm also...

866
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:21,960
I'm just so sorry if I...

867
00:37:21,961 --> 00:37:24,546
turned out to be yet another person

868
00:37:24,547 --> 00:37:27,758
that made you feel
abandoned in this life.

869
00:37:27,759 --> 00:37:31,303
You know, I just... I
genuinely regret that.

870
00:37:31,304 --> 00:37:35,308
And I... I hope you'll
accept my apology.

871
00:37:57,956 --> 00:38:00,165
It's real.

872
00:38:00,166 --> 00:38:02,251
I'm sorry.

873
00:38:02,252 --> 00:38:04,795
Yeah.

874
00:38:04,796 --> 00:38:07,089
Thank you for not saying,
"Now you can move on,"

875
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:09,216
or something ridiculous like that.

876
00:38:09,217 --> 00:38:10,801
I mean, I was tempted.

877
00:38:10,802 --> 00:38:12,053
Me too.

878
00:38:23,815 --> 00:38:25,107
I'm not ready.

879
00:38:25,108 --> 00:38:26,568
Hmm?

880
00:38:34,117 --> 00:38:35,785
Why?

881
00:38:37,745 --> 00:38:39,037
Why?

882
00:38:39,038 --> 00:38:40,581
Until there's an autopsy,

883
00:38:40,582 --> 00:38:41,832
there's no way to know for sure.

884
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:43,834
But whatever that infection was,

885
00:38:43,835 --> 00:38:48,505
it just weakened his heart
until we couldn't save him.

886
00:38:48,506 --> 00:38:50,215
Because he used drugs?

887
00:38:50,216 --> 00:38:53,177
Well, we might have a better
idea after the autopsy.

888
00:38:53,178 --> 00:38:54,887
But it's possible.

889
00:38:54,888 --> 00:38:56,848
Street drugs, dirty needles.

890
00:39:00,727 --> 00:39:02,186
Oh, man.

891
00:39:02,187 --> 00:39:04,104
Sean,

892
00:39:04,105 --> 00:39:06,941
I'm sorry I couldn't save him.

893
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:16,283
You did everything you could.

894
00:39:16,284 --> 00:39:18,660
In my world, you see a lot of loss.

895
00:39:18,661 --> 00:39:20,496
And no matter how hard you try,

896
00:39:20,497 --> 00:39:23,081
sometimes it's just never enough.

897
00:39:23,082 --> 00:39:25,667
I can guess how Sean is feeling.

898
00:39:25,668 --> 00:39:28,045
He came to the center full of hope,

899
00:39:28,046 --> 00:39:29,339
wanting to make a difference.

900
00:39:31,424 --> 00:39:33,802
I'll talk to him.

901
00:39:42,685 --> 00:39:45,187
Bert?

902
00:39:45,188 --> 00:39:48,565
I'll, uh, get tested, just to...

903
00:39:48,566 --> 00:39:50,235
just to get you off my back.

904
00:39:52,362 --> 00:39:53,403
Okay.

905
00:39:53,404 --> 00:39:55,448
Satisfied?

906
00:40:08,336 --> 00:40:10,587
Oh.

907
00:40:10,588 --> 00:40:12,632
- Hey.
- Hey.

908
00:40:14,425 --> 00:40:17,094
You, uh, pulling another shift?

909
00:40:17,095 --> 00:40:19,263
Yeah.

910
00:40:19,264 --> 00:40:22,642
I thought I was the only
one into self-flagellation.

911
00:40:24,477 --> 00:40:26,062
No, I'm pretty good at it too.

912
00:40:31,234 --> 00:40:32,401
Rough day?

913
00:40:32,402 --> 00:40:34,111
Yeah.

914
00:40:34,112 --> 00:40:36,280
You?

915
00:40:36,281 --> 00:40:37,907
Yeah.

916
00:40:46,499 --> 00:40:48,042
Get some rest.

917
00:40:53,256 --> 00:40:55,091
You too.
