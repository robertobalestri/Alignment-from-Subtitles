1
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:16,370
Well, she said that the dean
of admissions called her

2
00:00:16,455 --> 00:00:19,056
"perfect columbia material."
which makes me proud,

3
00:00:19,091 --> 00:00:21,459
But do-- do you want
olivia a plane ride away?

4
00:00:21,493 --> 00:00:23,561
No, no. Olivia's not going anywhere.

5
00:00:23,595 --> 00:00:25,796
Mnh-mnh.

6
00:00:25,831 --> 00:00:28,366
What do you hear from addie?

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,667
Uh, archer left.

8
00:00:30,702 --> 00:00:32,569
She's gonna stay a few more days

9
00:00:32,603 --> 00:00:34,905
And help the captain get ready
to move out. She holdin' up?

10
00:00:34,939 --> 00:00:37,207
Sounds like it, yeah.

11
00:00:37,275 --> 00:00:38,575
How about you?

12
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:40,544
Well, things have been a little crazy

13
00:00:40,578 --> 00:00:43,180
Between addison and me lately, so...

14
00:00:43,214 --> 00:00:45,048
Some time apart might be good.

15
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:47,784
But it's good. I'm good.

16
00:00:47,819 --> 00:00:50,053
You're lonely. I have olivia.

17
00:00:50,088 --> 00:00:53,790
yeah, I bet when you're
feeling sorry for yourself,

18
00:00:53,825 --> 00:00:55,926
You keep her up later
than you're supposed to.

19
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,861
You do. You know you do.

20
00:00:57,895 --> 00:01:01,098
I exercise the grandfather's prerogative,

21
00:01:01,132 --> 00:01:02,666
Uh, from time to time.

22
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,602
Well, since one baby needs her sleep

23
00:01:05,636 --> 00:01:07,504
And the other one needs some company...

24
00:01:07,538 --> 00:01:11,241
why don't we pick a night,
and I'll come back,

25
00:01:11,275 --> 00:01:14,778
And we'll put her down on time,
and then I'll cook dinner?

26
00:01:14,812 --> 00:01:18,613
What if we keep her up a little later

27
00:01:18,614 --> 00:01:20,649
And order in?

28
00:01:20,683 --> 00:01:21,750
Deal.

29
00:01:21,784 --> 00:01:23,218
okay.

30
00:01:25,121 --> 00:01:26,521
You got it?

31
00:01:26,556 --> 00:01:27,589
Uh-huh.

32
00:01:27,623 --> 00:01:29,724
Mm.

33
00:01:30,559 --> 00:01:33,411
Hey, I can finish up if you
want to get ready for work.

34
00:01:33,445 --> 00:01:35,363
We're fine.

35
00:01:35,397 --> 00:01:38,032
You can't still be mad.
Oh, that's where you're wrong.

36
00:01:38,066 --> 00:01:39,867
Come on, pete.

37
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:42,770
you know I had to rewrite the manuscript.

38
00:01:42,788 --> 00:01:45,773
The publisher asked me to go deeper,
and to do that,

39
00:01:45,807 --> 00:01:48,175
I had to share all my stories and--
and the people in them.

40
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,844
Going deeper into your life is fine.

41
00:01:49,878 --> 00:01:52,079
But completely exposing mine is not.
But you're a part of my life.

42
00:01:52,114 --> 00:01:53,481
My first marriage isn't.

43
00:01:53,515 --> 00:01:55,349
And neither is the fact
my mother's in prison.

44
00:01:55,384 --> 00:01:59,976
But you-- you overcame all that.
Which makes it my story, not yours.

45
00:02:00,011 --> 00:02:00,287
♪

46
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,723
Okay. Well, um...

47
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:06,059
I gave the revision to
everybody else in the practice

48
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:07,960
When they got back from bizzy's funeral,

49
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:11,464
And no one else has had a problem with it.
I don't care what anyone else thinks.

50
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,416
I hate your book, violet.

54
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:22,041
We were cooking dinner together with jack,

55
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:23,776
That's my fiancé,

56
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,844
And it just-- it happened.

57
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:28,948
She got quiet and she seemed confused,

58
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,783
And then her voice changed.

59
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,652
And I asked, "andi,
are you okay?" and then...

60
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:36,088
Gina responded.

61
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:38,490
Gina? That's one of her others.

62
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:41,860
That's what my sister calls
her alternate personalities.

63
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:46,632
Was that the first time that's happened?

64
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,635
Andi was diagnosed with
multiple personality disorder

65
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,337
When she was 7.

66
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:55,844
We were, uh, driving to
dinner with my parents.

67
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,174
It was raining.

68
00:02:57,209 --> 00:02:59,193
A car barreled through the intersection.

69
00:02:59,227 --> 00:03:01,112
Our parents died. We survived.

70
00:03:01,146 --> 00:03:04,048
And it took a lot of therapy,

71
00:03:04,082 --> 00:03:05,983
But I'm-- I'm with her everyday.

72
00:03:06,018 --> 00:03:08,686
I haven't seen another personality in...

73
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,921
Almost ten years.

74
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,428
I had already tucked tanya in

75
00:03:17,462 --> 00:03:19,430
And was getting ready for bed myself

76
00:03:19,464 --> 00:03:21,399
When I heard these noises
coming from her room.

77
00:03:21,433 --> 00:03:23,300
Sometimes she likes to stay up,

78
00:03:23,335 --> 00:03:25,970
Playing with her stuffed animals,
but when I went in... It was just ricky.

79
00:03:26,004 --> 00:03:28,906
Who's ricky? My friend.
We go to school together.

80
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,242
Yeah. they were having sex, dr. Bennett.

81
00:03:31,276 --> 00:03:32,610
He comes over sometimes.

82
00:03:32,644 --> 00:03:35,413
apparently, it's been going on for a while.

83
00:03:35,447 --> 00:03:37,431
Don't tell your mom. Oh.

84
00:03:37,482 --> 00:03:41,334
she'd been complaining of stomach pains.

85
00:03:41,369 --> 00:03:42,620
I didn't know why, and now...

86
00:03:44,054 --> 00:03:45,955
I think she needs a pregnancy test.

87
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:47,890
Oh, well, stomach pains could mean anything.

88
00:03:47,908 --> 00:03:49,892
It could be the flu,
it could be appendicitis.

89
00:03:49,927 --> 00:03:51,027
Please.

90
00:03:51,061 --> 00:03:52,462
Okay. All right.

91
00:03:52,496 --> 00:03:54,447
Tanya, why don't you lie back for me, okay?

92
00:03:54,481 --> 00:03:56,065
I'm gonna check your belly.

93
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:58,034
You're not gonna check my heart?

94
00:03:58,068 --> 00:04:00,069
I know I normally do check your heart,

95
00:04:00,104 --> 00:04:02,405
But today, I'm gonna look inside your belly

96
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:04,040
With a special machine.

97
00:04:05,774 --> 00:04:09,710
This may be a little chilly. You ready? Mm.

98
00:04:09,745 --> 00:04:11,579
Yuck. I know.

99
00:04:11,613 --> 00:04:13,481
You know how closely I watch her.

100
00:04:13,515 --> 00:04:15,683
Erin, you are a great mother,
and of a teenager,

101
00:04:15,717 --> 00:04:18,786
Which means hormones and...

102
00:04:18,821 --> 00:04:21,422
What's in my belly?

103
00:04:21,456 --> 00:04:23,524
Oh, god.

105
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:39,640
Lara's been taking care of
me since our parents died.

106
00:04:39,675 --> 00:04:41,609
She had just turned 18, and suddenly,

107
00:04:41,643 --> 00:04:44,412
She was looking after a
7 year old full-time.

108
00:04:44,446 --> 00:04:46,380
Which is how she still treats me.

109
00:04:46,415 --> 00:04:47,949
She's a big sister.

110
00:04:47,983 --> 00:04:50,618
Yeah, but it's almost 20 years later.

111
00:04:50,652 --> 00:04:52,987
I have a job. I pay my bills.

112
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:56,123
She can't worry about me forever.

113
00:04:56,158 --> 00:04:58,793
Losing your parents at such an early age

114
00:04:58,827 --> 00:05:00,461
Is a significant trauma.

115
00:05:00,495 --> 00:05:04,332
And I think she's worried
about how you're coping.

116
00:05:04,366 --> 00:05:06,500
Meaning, she's worried about my others.

117
00:05:06,535 --> 00:05:07,969
She mentioned them.

118
00:05:08,003 --> 00:05:09,537
But she also said

119
00:05:09,571 --> 00:05:12,006
That they had gone away for a long time.

120
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,841
Yeah.

121
00:05:13,876 --> 00:05:16,177
It's okay, andi.

122
00:05:16,211 --> 00:05:18,446
It's not your fault.

123
00:05:20,015 --> 00:05:21,916
Lara said that you were having dinner

124
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,585
When one of your others appeared.

125
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,554
Do you remember anything about that?

126
00:05:26,588 --> 00:05:27,955
no. I black out.

127
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,591
I- I don't know what they say or do.

128
00:05:30,626 --> 00:05:32,593
It's awful.

129
00:05:32,628 --> 00:05:35,062
So you can't remember anything?

130
00:05:35,097 --> 00:05:37,031
Not really.

131
00:05:37,065 --> 00:05:39,133
Nothing at all?

132
00:05:41,103 --> 00:05:42,970
Andi?

133
00:05:45,657 --> 00:05:51,277
She answered the question, jackass.

134
00:05:51,311 --> 00:05:52,845
My name is gina.

135
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:56,682
And you need to back the hell off!

136
00:05:56,716 --> 00:05:58,684
I think shrinks are good.

137
00:05:58,718 --> 00:06:00,586
I think talking is good,

138
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,621
And charlotte and I as a couple, we're...

139
00:06:02,656 --> 00:06:04,056
good.

140
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:07,126
But here you are, so I have to
assume there are some issues.

141
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,777
We don't have issues.

142
00:06:08,812 --> 00:06:11,146
Well, no big ones.

143
00:06:13,566 --> 00:06:15,501
Uh...

144
00:06:15,535 --> 00:06:17,686
She won't wear her engagement ring.

145
00:06:17,721 --> 00:06:20,372
It was broken, and I had
it fixed and polished.

146
00:06:20,407 --> 00:06:21,840
How did it break?

147
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,442
I was raped.

148
00:06:24,476 --> 00:06:26,377
The attacker broke my left hand.

149
00:06:26,412 --> 00:06:28,346
They had to cut it off at the hospital.

150
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,249
Well, that must have been
very difficult for you.

151
00:06:31,283 --> 00:06:32,817
The ring's a reminder.

152
00:06:34,253 --> 00:06:35,820
Why didn't you tell me?

153
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,955
I'll buy you another one.
I don't want another one.

154
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:40,525
You can't wear the one you have,
but you don't want another one?

155
00:06:40,559 --> 00:06:42,260
What does that even mean?

156
00:06:42,294 --> 00:06:45,663
Well, it seems we do have
something to talk about.

157
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:48,232
I mean, one minute, she's talking calmly,

158
00:06:48,267 --> 00:06:51,202
And then bam. She's yelling
obscenities at me. Andi?

159
00:06:51,236 --> 00:06:53,371
Gina. Her alter.

160
00:06:53,405 --> 00:06:54,806
What was she mad at?

161
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,008
Me. She thought I was attacking
lara and her fiancé.

162
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:58,609
I mean, gina's very protective.

163
00:06:58,644 --> 00:07:00,945
And how did you know it wasn't andi?

164
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:02,380
The transformation was remarkable--

165
00:07:02,414 --> 00:07:04,949
The-- the inflection,
the-- the change in her posture.

166
00:07:04,983 --> 00:07:07,668
And you're sure she wasn't faking it?
Every woman does.

167
00:07:07,703 --> 00:07:09,387
No, that's... We're talking

168
00:07:09,421 --> 00:07:11,956
About a patient with multiple
personality disorder, not, uh...

169
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,625
Orgasms. Gotcha.

170
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:18,496
Is that even real-- the whole sybil thing?
Gina's very convincing,
and she was not happy

171
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:21,532
That I was poking around in andi's head.
Well, can't blame her for that.

172
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:25,504
Oh, says the girl who delights
in drilling holes in skulls.

173
00:07:25,539 --> 00:07:27,637
Well, at least what I
do is rooted in science.

174
00:07:27,671 --> 00:07:30,206
There is pet-scan data
evidencing neurological changes

175
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,208
In the brains of patients with m.P.D.

176
00:07:32,242 --> 00:07:34,911
One. One study, and it is
right up there with that wacko

177
00:07:34,945 --> 00:07:37,313
Who said that vaccinating
your kid causes autism.

178
00:07:37,347 --> 00:07:39,932
I am not saying I don't believe
in dissociated behavior.

179
00:07:39,967 --> 00:07:43,286
I- I-I've had patients with
borderline personality disorders

180
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,221
Who-- who act out,
who-- who try to manipulate.

181
00:07:45,255 --> 00:07:49,825
But it's usually for, uh, for personal gain.

182
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,777
You... okay, no.

183
00:07:51,812 --> 00:07:54,880
I'm sorry. I know this is
totally uncool of me to ask,

184
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:57,333
But, um...

185
00:07:57,367 --> 00:07:59,368
Have either of you read my manuscript?

186
00:07:59,403 --> 00:08:03,527
The one where you basically call me a whore?

187
00:08:03,562 --> 00:08:05,907
Yep, I read it.

188
00:08:05,941 --> 00:08:08,259
That's not what I-I-- no.

189
00:08:08,294 --> 00:08:10,378
Y- you have a certain sexual confidence,

190
00:08:10,412 --> 00:08:12,146
Which-- which is great.

191
00:08:12,181 --> 00:08:14,566
And I was trying to
contrast that with the fact

192
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,685
That I had some, uh, issues
with intimacy after the attack.

193
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,921
Ah. Well, y-you understood that, didn't you?

194
00:08:19,955 --> 00:08:21,839
I haven't gotten to that part.

195
00:08:21,874 --> 00:08:24,492
I'm still enjoying the section
where you're discussing

196
00:08:24,526 --> 00:08:27,562
Cheating on pete with me and
then chucking me overboard.

197
00:08:27,596 --> 00:08:30,398
Not that I don't enjoy being
described as "rebound sex."

198
00:08:30,432 --> 00:08:33,101
Sheldon, I never said-- I believe
"sexual leftovers" was your phrase.

199
00:08:33,135 --> 00:08:36,120
I mean, honestly, violet,
if you're gonna go down that road,

200
00:08:36,171 --> 00:08:37,722
The least you could have done

201
00:08:37,756 --> 00:08:39,841
Is discuss my more positive attributes.

202
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:42,410
So if you have any more books in you,
I would appreciate it

203
00:08:42,444 --> 00:08:43,811
If you'd refrain

204
00:08:43,846 --> 00:08:46,114
From any and all discussion
of our sexual history

205
00:08:46,148 --> 00:08:47,715
As well as any failure

206
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,750
I might have had in
pursuing you romantically.

207
00:08:49,768 --> 00:08:52,420
What he's really saying-- "filter."

208
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,874
Tanya can't safely carry a baby

209
00:08:56,925 --> 00:08:58,826
Let alone deliver one, can she?

210
00:08:58,844 --> 00:09:00,812
Well, because of the cardiac issues

211
00:09:00,846 --> 00:09:02,313
That are secondary to down's,

212
00:09:02,364 --> 00:09:04,332
It would be a high-risk pregnancy.

213
00:09:04,366 --> 00:09:07,035
But with proper monitoring,
yes, she could do it.

214
00:09:07,069 --> 00:09:08,903
Yeah.

215
00:09:10,437 --> 00:09:12,906
I mean, tanya has down's,

216
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,108
Ricky has severe learning disabilities.

217
00:09:15,142 --> 00:09:17,510
I just-- I don't know how
they could raise a child.

218
00:09:17,545 --> 00:09:18,978
Well, they'd need your help.

219
00:09:19,013 --> 00:09:20,847
And if the baby has special needs, too?

220
00:09:20,881 --> 00:09:23,316
Well, I-it may not.
Yes, there's a 50% chance

221
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:26,085
That the baby could be born
with down's and could be

222
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,621
At greater risk for other
kinds of complications, but--

223
00:09:28,656 --> 00:09:30,089
Please, dr. Bennett.

224
00:09:30,124 --> 00:09:32,425
I appreciate how supportive
you're trying to be.

225
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:34,644
I- I love tanya

226
00:09:34,695 --> 00:09:36,996
More than anything.

227
00:09:37,031 --> 00:09:40,400
But after I had her,
I couldn't have another child.

228
00:09:40,434 --> 00:09:43,436
I wanted to keep her at home,
raise her myself,

229
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:46,339
And it was so much work.

230
00:09:46,373 --> 00:09:49,475
Tanya couldn't do it, and I'm...

231
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:53,363
I don't know if I can do it again.

232
00:09:53,414 --> 00:09:56,382
So you're prepared...

233
00:09:56,417 --> 00:09:58,918
To abort the baby?

234
00:10:00,953 --> 00:10:03,921
I'm not sure I have another option.

235
00:10:03,956 --> 00:10:06,424
Well, how would tanya feel about that?

236
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:09,260
Erin has power of attorney for tanya,

237
00:10:09,294 --> 00:10:11,495
So it would be her decision.

238
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:14,031
Okay, well, at this point,
it's-- it's a procedure.

239
00:10:14,066 --> 00:10:16,601
It's not a pill.
So what would you tell tanya?

240
00:10:16,635 --> 00:10:19,337
Well, I wouldn't want to lie to her.

241
00:10:19,371 --> 00:10:20,771
But...

242
00:10:22,374 --> 00:10:25,343
Why don't you take some time
to really think this over?

243
00:10:25,377 --> 00:10:27,511
And, uh, in the interim, we can do c.V.S.

244
00:10:27,546 --> 00:10:29,580
Genetic screening?

245
00:10:29,615 --> 00:10:31,883
If you are serious about this abortion,

246
00:10:31,917 --> 00:10:34,085
Tanya is already 11 weeks.

247
00:10:34,119 --> 00:10:36,220
A couple more days,
it becomes a bigger procedure.

248
00:10:36,255 --> 00:10:38,956
But if we do the c.V.S.,
you'll be able to know

249
00:10:38,991 --> 00:10:40,892
Whether or not the baby has down's

250
00:10:40,926 --> 00:10:43,961
Or any other abnormalities
or if the baby is fine.

251
00:10:46,431 --> 00:10:47,899
Well, then...

252
00:10:47,933 --> 00:10:49,984
let's-- let's do the test.

253
00:10:50,035 --> 00:10:52,236
Great.

254
00:11:01,788 --> 00:11:03,489
You know what I don't understand?

255
00:11:03,507 --> 00:11:05,891
Why can't people just be happy for me?

256
00:11:05,926 --> 00:11:08,094
I wrote a book. It's a big deal.

257
00:11:08,128 --> 00:11:11,564
When sam published a book,
we threw him a damn party.

258
00:11:11,598 --> 00:11:14,700
Why aren't you looking up at me?

259
00:11:16,735 --> 00:11:18,569
Oh, not you, too.

260
00:11:18,603 --> 00:11:20,704
"man-child"?

261
00:11:23,174 --> 00:11:25,409
Okay. Uh, yes.

262
00:11:25,443 --> 00:11:27,711
I did call you that once.

263
00:11:27,746 --> 00:11:29,296
Maybe twice.

264
00:11:29,331 --> 00:11:31,948
But-- but that isn't all
that I said about you.

265
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:34,335
I- I-I repeatedly refer
to you as my best friend.

266
00:11:34,386 --> 00:11:36,086
Man... Child.

267
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,223
Oh, come on, coop.
I need someone on my side.

268
00:11:39,257 --> 00:11:40,791
Man-child!

269
00:11:42,644 --> 00:11:44,645
You guilted erin into taking that test.

270
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:46,630
No, I am just trying to make sure

271
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:48,298
That she understands the situation

272
00:11:48,316 --> 00:11:51,301
Before she makes a decision
that she and tanya might regret.

273
00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:53,604
You just didn't want her
to have an abortion.

274
00:11:53,638 --> 00:11:55,639
No. No, I don't want her
to have an abortion.

275
00:11:55,657 --> 00:11:57,708
But you're not the one
that's gonna have to raise

276
00:11:57,742 --> 00:11:59,309
That child-- her grandchild.

277
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,412
I know what it's like to
help raise a grandchild.

278
00:12:01,446 --> 00:12:03,313
What are you hoping for here, nai--

279
00:12:03,331 --> 00:12:06,283
A healthy baby and for erin to
decide that tanya can keep it?

280
00:12:06,317 --> 00:12:09,153
Yes. And if that baby has down's, then what?

281
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:11,088
I know you're not gonna advise
her to have an abortion.

282
00:12:11,122 --> 00:12:13,123
The catholic in you
couldn't tolerate the sin

283
00:12:13,158 --> 00:12:15,626
While the doctor would worry
it feels like eugenics.

284
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,594
Look, if erin has the responsibility

285
00:12:17,628 --> 00:12:19,630
Of raising two children
with down's, how good

286
00:12:19,664 --> 00:12:22,099
Do you think that's gonna
be for tanya and the baby?

287
00:12:22,133 --> 00:12:24,435
What's gonna happen when erin's gone?

288
00:12:24,469 --> 00:12:27,805
The longer this goes on,
the more aware tanya's gonna be,

289
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,274
And the harder it's gonna be for erin

290
00:12:30,308 --> 00:12:32,176
To explain to her daughter
that she doesn't want

291
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,978
To have another baby that's like her.
Maybe the baby won't have down's.

292
00:12:35,013 --> 00:12:37,114
Maybe the baby won't have anything.

293
00:12:37,148 --> 00:12:39,450
That's the hope you're selling her--
of having the baby

294
00:12:39,484 --> 00:12:42,219
She didn't get the first time around.
I never said that.

295
00:12:42,253 --> 00:12:44,755
You didn't have to.

296
00:12:47,325 --> 00:12:49,359
She does seem to be dissociating.

297
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,678
I've known andi for five years,
dr. Wallace--

298
00:12:51,763 --> 00:12:53,731
Almost as long as I've known lara.

299
00:12:53,765 --> 00:12:57,167
Not once have I seen any of
these so-called personalities.

300
00:12:57,202 --> 00:13:00,003
I know this disorder can
be difficult to understand.

301
00:13:00,038 --> 00:13:02,506
Disorder? Is that what we call
it when my future sister-in-law

302
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:05,442
Decides to go crazy cakes
a week before we move?

303
00:13:05,477 --> 00:13:08,579
Calling her crazy is not
helping the situation.

304
00:13:10,348 --> 00:13:13,367
I'm sorry. You're right.

305
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,988
So... where are you moving?

306
00:13:18,022 --> 00:13:19,523
Arizona. Jack got promoted.

307
00:13:19,557 --> 00:13:21,525
I'll be managing a new plant in phoenix.

308
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:23,460
We're supposed to go down this weekend

309
00:13:23,495 --> 00:13:26,063
And look for houses. No,
you're gonna have to go without me.

310
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:27,998
I'm gonna have to stay here.

311
00:13:28,032 --> 00:13:30,968
We talked about this at dinner,
before your sister started-- stop it.

312
00:13:31,002 --> 00:13:33,137
Look...

313
00:13:33,171 --> 00:13:34,838
I'm not going without you.

314
00:13:34,872 --> 00:13:37,908
I can't leave andi. I'm sorry.

315
00:13:43,214 --> 00:13:44,798
Thank you.

316
00:13:44,849 --> 00:13:46,633
Hey.

317
00:13:46,684 --> 00:13:48,685
You can stop being all moody moose now.

318
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,687
I'm wearing it.

319
00:13:50,722 --> 00:13:53,457
I don't want you to wear it.

320
00:13:53,491 --> 00:13:54,925
Yes, you do.

321
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,360
No, I...

322
00:13:56,394 --> 00:13:58,428
You were wearing it when he raped you.

323
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:01,365
I was also wearing my skin that day.

324
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:04,284
There's nothing I can do about it.

325
00:14:04,335 --> 00:14:06,370
If you don't want to wear the ring,

326
00:14:06,404 --> 00:14:07,838
You shouldn't wear it.

327
00:14:07,872 --> 00:14:09,873
Why can't I get you another one?

328
00:14:09,907 --> 00:14:11,792
It's a waste of money. It's just a ring.

329
00:14:11,843 --> 00:14:13,877
It's an engagement ring.
It says you're mine.

330
00:14:13,911 --> 00:14:15,512
It makes it official.

331
00:14:15,547 --> 00:14:18,048
We're official because we're
committed to each other.

332
00:14:18,082 --> 00:14:20,551
There are steps in people's
lives together, charlotte--

333
00:14:20,585 --> 00:14:22,919
Sex, moving in, ring, marriage.

334
00:14:22,937 --> 00:14:24,421
We're on the ring.

335
00:14:24,455 --> 00:14:26,723
Which I'm wearing.

336
00:14:28,193 --> 00:14:31,061
"and then the woman I thought
was my friend and confidant

337
00:14:31,095 --> 00:14:34,948
Told a judge I shouldn't be
given custody of my own child."

338
00:14:34,983 --> 00:14:37,801
paging addison montgomery.

339
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:40,320
"it was hardly an impartial opinion

340
00:14:40,355 --> 00:14:41,905
"since at the time,

341
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,291
She was basically living
with my son's father."

342
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:47,077
Oh, man. I better hide addison's
copy of this manuscript

343
00:14:47,111 --> 00:14:49,613
Before she gets back.
Anything can be made to sound bad

344
00:14:49,647 --> 00:14:51,415
When it's taken out of context.

345
00:14:51,449 --> 00:14:54,151
Like the part where violet
says she reconsidered

346
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:56,786
All of the parenting advice you gave her

347
00:14:56,804 --> 00:14:59,773
Once your 16-year-old daughter got knocked
up? She did not drag maya into this.

348
00:14:59,824 --> 00:15:02,392
Mm-hmm. You know what
part I thought was a hoot?

349
00:15:02,427 --> 00:15:04,695

350
00:15:04,729 --> 00:15:06,964
As well as she does. That's no hint.

351
00:15:06,998 --> 00:15:09,700

352
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:16,723

I didn't write the damn book.

353
00:15:16,758 --> 00:15:19,643
You need to sit her down, pete.
And say what?

354
00:15:19,677 --> 00:15:22,579
That she needs to take us out
of the book. tell her own story.

355
00:15:22,614 --> 00:15:25,682
Don't drag the rest of us through
the mud. What makes you think
she's gonna listen to me?

356
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:27,784

357
00:15:27,819 --> 00:15:31,088

365
00:16:03,928 --> 00:16:07,113
Uh, that's not what this was, honey.

00:16:07,148 --> 00:16:09,566

It was a test on a baby.

375
00:16:40,346 --> 00:16:43,264

Are you planning on moving there with them?

388
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:28,275
No. It's just gonna be the two of them.

389
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,944
Are you okay with that?

00:23:30,803 --> 00:23:33,138
N-- not because I am selfish,

528
00:23:33,172 --> 00:23:36,008
But because I think this
book will really help people.

529
00:23:36,042 --> 00:23:37,409
It'll help people.

530
00:23:37,443 --> 00:23:40,012
What if it alienates the
people you love in the process?

531
00:23:40,046 --> 00:23:42,481
I don't want to have to
choose between the two.

532
00:23:42,515 --> 00:23:44,349
Well, that's where we are.

533
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,318
You know how everybody feels, violet.

534
00:23:46,352 --> 00:23:49,254
What you do with that is your call.

535
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:01,164
I screwed up.

536
00:24:01,199 --> 00:24:02,933
I am so...

537
00:24:02,967 --> 00:24:05,302
So, so, sorry.

538
00:24:05,336 --> 00:24:07,871
Unbelievably sorry.

539
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:10,674
How can I make this better?

540
00:24:12,677 --> 00:24:16,646
You won't even look at me?

541
00:24:19,484 --> 00:24:21,918
You know, in the past, I have forgiven you

542
00:24:21,953 --> 00:24:23,270
Because I could see beyond

543
00:24:23,304 --> 00:24:25,222
What you've done in a moment of crazy

544
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:27,207
To who you really were, who you are.

545
00:24:27,241 --> 00:24:29,926
Don't I get the same courtesy?

546
00:24:31,396 --> 00:24:33,697
Oh, my god. Charlotte, look at me.

547
00:24:33,731 --> 00:24:36,550
Come-- glare, scowl, yell.

548
00:24:36,584 --> 00:24:38,001
Punch me.

549
00:24:38,035 --> 00:24:41,138
Come on. You have to fight back.

550
00:24:41,172 --> 00:24:42,606
Mm.

551
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,776
Cooper, you told me something.

552
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:48,345
Now I get to process.

553
00:24:49,879 --> 00:24:51,747
Let me.

554
00:25:09,432 --> 00:25:11,833
Hey.

555
00:25:11,868 --> 00:25:14,886
Either andi's meryl streep
or this thing is real.

556
00:25:14,921 --> 00:25:16,838
So it's true multiple personality disorder?

557
00:25:16,873 --> 00:25:19,808
I started art therapy with
her during our last session.

558
00:25:19,842 --> 00:25:21,677
When-- when she shifted
from andi to maggie--

559
00:25:21,711 --> 00:25:25,013
Maggie? I thought it was gina.
No, gina's the older, angry one.

560
00:25:25,048 --> 00:25:26,965
Maggie is the emotional, little one.

561
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,251
It was her this time.
Anyway, when they switched,

562
00:25:29,285 --> 00:25:31,069
Maggie continued to draw, right?

563
00:25:31,104 --> 00:25:33,905
But this time with her left hand. Look.

564
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:37,643
This is andi on the right,
and maggie on the left.

565
00:25:37,677 --> 00:25:38,994
Her different personalities

566
00:25:39,028 --> 00:25:40,929
Draw with different hands
with the same ease.

567
00:25:40,964 --> 00:25:42,831
You know, only 3% of the population

568
00:25:42,865 --> 00:25:46,750
Is ambidextrous.
So you've made your diagnosis.

569
00:25:47,185 --> 00:25:48,752
Well, yes, and...

570
00:25:48,786 --> 00:25:50,303
No.

571
00:25:50,338 --> 00:25:52,839
I- I'm not-- something's not right.

572
00:25:52,874 --> 00:25:54,825
I know this disorder
presents strangely, but--

573
00:25:54,859 --> 00:25:57,210
Well, does it really matter? I mean,
whatever the reason,

574
00:25:57,245 --> 00:25:59,045
This woman is profoundly disturbed.

575
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,881
And whatever you want to call it,

576
00:26:00,915 --> 00:26:03,750
You have to keep treating her.
Well, if andi is faking it to stop lara

577
00:26:03,785 --> 00:26:07,454
- From moving on with her life, I
- I need to know that. Well, just... Be careful.

578
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:10,740
If-- if you push too hard,
she could collapse emotionally,

579
00:26:10,792 --> 00:26:12,993
And then... Then everybody loses.

580
00:26:19,298 --> 00:26:22,501
I didn't mean to make this harder on erin.

581
00:26:22,535 --> 00:26:24,719
I know. But I did.

582
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:27,239
Yeah. Yeah.

583
00:26:27,273 --> 00:26:30,208
God, I just, you know,
I just keep thinking about olivia,

584
00:26:30,243 --> 00:26:33,478
And if we had encouraged maya to terminate.

585
00:26:33,496 --> 00:26:35,180
Well, you did.

586
00:26:35,214 --> 00:26:37,983
I know I did.

587
00:26:38,017 --> 00:26:39,451
But she didn't.

588
00:26:39,485 --> 00:26:40,969
And I'm so grateful.

589
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:43,889
Of course, but... It's different with erin.

590
00:26:43,923 --> 00:26:45,824
You know, she's alone raising tanya,

591
00:26:45,858 --> 00:26:48,727
And with another baby, down's or no down's,

592
00:26:48,761 --> 00:26:51,196
It's-- it's a lot. Oh, sam.

593
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:53,548
What are we gonna do if
maya gets in to columbia?

594
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:56,001
Ugh. I've been thinking about that, too.

595
00:26:56,035 --> 00:26:59,504
Oh, it's... It's not easy
to be a student and a mom.

596
00:26:59,538 --> 00:27:01,389
Well, we'll figure it out.

597
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,291
We always do.

598
00:27:04,877 --> 00:27:06,311
Yeah, well...

599
00:27:06,345 --> 00:27:08,213
It's-- it's not the same...

600
00:27:08,247 --> 00:27:09,814
You and me.

601
00:27:09,849 --> 00:27:11,282
What do you mean?

602
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,667
Well, I mean, it's just--

603
00:27:12,718 --> 00:27:14,669
It's not just you and me anymore, you know?

604
00:27:14,704 --> 00:27:17,172
Wait. Ad-addison isn't-- she--

605
00:27:17,206 --> 00:27:19,424
Addison is my best friend.

606
00:27:19,458 --> 00:27:20,825
And, uh...

607
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:23,562
Well, the fact that you chose her...

608
00:27:23,596 --> 00:27:26,531
I- I could pretend that it doesn't hurt,

609
00:27:26,566 --> 00:27:28,466
And I think I do a pretty good job--

610
00:27:28,484 --> 00:27:32,137
Not all the time,
but given the circumstances.

611
00:27:34,056 --> 00:27:35,674
It...

612
00:27:36,908 --> 00:27:38,392
Still hurts, sam.

613
00:27:38,443 --> 00:27:41,345
And as much as we have a history

614
00:27:41,379 --> 00:27:44,681
And maya and, uh... I love you.

615
00:27:44,716 --> 00:27:46,850
I just...

616
00:27:46,885 --> 00:27:48,485
I don't trust you.

617
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,855
Well, not like I used to.

618
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:53,624
Uh, uh, but I can try.

619
00:27:53,658 --> 00:27:55,626
And I-I will try. I mean, I am.

620
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:59,329
I'm trying. I'm trying. It's just...

621
00:27:59,364 --> 00:28:02,533
It's-- it's just not the same.

622
00:28:28,551 --> 00:28:31,687
Okay, look, uh, I know you've
all read the manuscript.

623
00:28:31,721 --> 00:28:34,123
And, um, I know that in
this latest revision,

624
00:28:34,157 --> 00:28:36,492
Some of you feel-- mischaracterized?

625
00:28:36,526 --> 00:28:38,844
Betrayed? Blinded by near-murderous rage?

626
00:28:38,895 --> 00:28:41,296
Um... No, I was gonna say

627
00:28:41,331 --> 00:28:44,400
That some of you feel like
I took some cheap shots.

628
00:28:48,071 --> 00:28:49,938
Okay, so here's what we're gonna do--

629
00:28:49,973 --> 00:28:51,573
Everybody in this room, right now,

630
00:28:51,607 --> 00:28:54,610
Say the ugliest thing you've
ever thought about me.

631
00:28:54,644 --> 00:28:56,812
The thing you never
thought you'd say? Say it.

632
00:28:56,846 --> 00:29:00,048
Violet, do you really think that's a good
idea? Absolutely. Let
her rip. Whatever you--

633
00:29:00,066 --> 00:29:02,184
You're condescending. Sorry.

634
00:29:02,218 --> 00:29:04,052
I just really wanted to be first,

635
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:07,021
Because if you tell me to filter again,

636
00:29:07,056 --> 00:29:09,907
I am gonna bludgeon you to
death with a reflex hammer.

637
00:29:09,942 --> 00:29:12,343
Okay. Okay. Good. Looks like we've started.

638
00:29:12,394 --> 00:29:14,328
You're cheap.

639
00:29:14,362 --> 00:29:17,398
Never once have I seen
you reach for the check.

640
00:29:17,433 --> 00:29:20,201
Well, I-I prefer "frugal," but--

641
00:29:20,235 --> 00:29:22,804
You can't dance.

642
00:29:22,838 --> 00:29:25,273
I know you think you can, but you can't.

643
00:29:25,307 --> 00:29:27,208
Well, that's not terrible--

644
00:29:27,242 --> 00:29:29,677
And you still play air guitar.
That is terrible.

645
00:29:29,711 --> 00:29:31,779
Yes. Yep.

646
00:29:31,814 --> 00:29:33,948
So anything? You?

647
00:29:36,318 --> 00:29:38,920
Man-child.

648
00:29:42,089 --> 00:29:44,657
okay.

649
00:29:44,691 --> 00:29:46,225
I'm sorry.

650
00:29:46,259 --> 00:29:48,394
Truly. I- I probably should've

651
00:29:48,428 --> 00:29:51,163
Gotten your permission
before I started all this,

652
00:29:51,197 --> 00:29:53,499
But I'm new at this, and, uh, and it's hard.

653
00:29:53,533 --> 00:29:57,186
And I-I tried to, uh,
sketch a full picture of each of you.

654
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:01,440
And I tried to be harder
on myself than anyone else.

655
00:30:01,475 --> 00:30:03,809
But if there is anybody in this room

656
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:06,745
Who is honestly saying that
they can't get past this,

657
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:09,115
If what I wrote is gonna
cost my relationship

658
00:30:09,149 --> 00:30:11,316
With even one of you,

659
00:30:11,334 --> 00:30:14,186
Then I'll tell the publisher I can't do it.

660
00:30:15,121 --> 00:30:18,790
So you decide.

661
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:26,497
Andi, you can see

662
00:30:26,515 --> 00:30:28,433
That your sister and jack
are worried about you.

663
00:30:28,467 --> 00:30:30,702
But you don't think they
need to be. I'm fine.

664
00:30:30,736 --> 00:30:33,571
See? We don't need to stay. She's not fine.

665
00:30:33,606 --> 00:30:36,641
You told me your sister still baby's you.
Andi, you said that?

666
00:30:36,675 --> 00:30:39,811
I told him it was out of love.
She plays both sides of the fence.

667
00:30:39,845 --> 00:30:42,547
She tells everybody she's fine,
and then when she's with us,

668
00:30:42,581 --> 00:30:44,182
She freaks out. Why would I do that?

669
00:30:44,216 --> 00:30:45,917
To keep your sister here. Is that true?

670
00:30:45,951 --> 00:30:48,520
She has always resented the time
lara spends with me. Jack, please.

671
00:30:48,554 --> 00:30:50,455
No, no. Just let him talk. Please.

672
00:30:50,489 --> 00:30:52,323
We are building a life together.

673
00:30:52,358 --> 00:30:54,159
That could include your sister,

674
00:30:54,193 --> 00:30:57,028
But she doesn't want to share
you with me. She never has.

675
00:30:57,063 --> 00:31:00,065
I've put up with it because I love you,
but it's enough. Jack, leave her alone!

676
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:02,934
Open your eyes! Don't yell at my sister!

677
00:31:04,468 --> 00:31:07,437
Gina... Please calm down.

678
00:31:07,471 --> 00:31:09,205
Okay, enough with the craziness--

679
00:31:09,239 --> 00:31:12,826
I hate you. I've always hated you.
That's not true, andi.

680
00:31:12,877 --> 00:31:14,761
My name is gina. No, it's not.

681
00:31:14,795 --> 00:31:18,848
It was maggie, not gina,
who told me she hated jack.

682
00:31:18,883 --> 00:31:21,151
You got them reversed.

683
00:31:32,162 --> 00:31:33,395
Andi...

684
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:35,964
After everything we've been through,

685
00:31:35,999 --> 00:31:39,301
Why would you lie?

686
00:31:39,335 --> 00:31:43,105
Because...

687
00:31:43,139 --> 00:31:45,074
I love jack.

688
00:31:45,108 --> 00:31:48,911
And you're going to take him away from me.

689
00:31:56,753 --> 00:31:59,955
Hey. I got the results of
tanya george's c.V.S. Test,

690
00:31:59,989 --> 00:32:03,609
But I can't get erin on the phone. Oh,
well, I'm-- I'm sure she'll call you back.

691
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:06,378
Yeah, I know, but I-I feel
like I want to tell her now.

692
00:32:06,413 --> 00:32:09,364
Will you drive with me to her house? Okay.

693
00:32:09,398 --> 00:32:11,166
