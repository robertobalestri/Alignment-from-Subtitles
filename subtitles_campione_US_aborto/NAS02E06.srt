1
00:00:09,953 --> 00:00:11,687
Whoa.

2
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:14,902
I don't think I've seen
the ED this quiet since...

3
00:00:14,903 --> 00:00:17,104
I don't think I've ever seen
the ED this quiet.

4
00:00:17,138 --> 00:00:18,405
Could be the new moon.

5
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:20,774
Or because NYU's on spring break.

6
00:00:20,808 --> 00:00:22,609
I'd say I hope it stays
like this for you,

7
00:00:22,644 --> 00:00:24,211
but I know you're a masochist.

8
00:00:24,245 --> 00:00:27,080
Uh, no, not anymore. I've changed.

9
00:00:27,115 --> 00:00:28,637
Mm.

10
00:01:29,744 --> 00:01:31,378
Incoming!

11
00:01:33,581 --> 00:01:36,617
32-year-old woman,
restrained passenger in MVA.

12
00:01:36,651 --> 00:01:37,951
A van hit an embankment.

13
00:01:37,986 --> 00:01:40,153
O2 sats in the 80s and dropping.

14
00:01:40,188 --> 00:01:41,288
Okay, she may need to be tubed.

15
00:01:41,322 --> 00:01:42,322
I'll get an airway box.

16
00:01:42,357 --> 00:01:44,291
Casey, draw up etomidate and sux.

17
00:01:44,325 --> 00:01:47,327
We got this. One, two, three.

18
00:01:50,365 --> 00:01:52,466
Okay, let's bag her with 100% O-2.

19
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,700
Looks like a class two airway.

20
00:01:53,735 --> 00:01:54,888
Incoming!

21
00:01:54,922 --> 00:01:56,870
Okay, use a rapid sequence technique.

22
00:01:56,904 --> 00:01:58,238
Casey, when you finish,

23
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,873
get a 12 lead EKG
and a stat portable chest.

24
00:01:59,907 --> 00:02:01,108
You got it.

25
00:02:01,142 --> 00:02:03,410
- Restrained passenger in MVA.
- Man, I was good and asleep

26
00:02:03,444 --> 00:02:05,646
and then all of a sudden, boom!

27
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,915
Glass was flying everywhere and whatnot.

28
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,384
- Let's get her to bay 27.
- God bless...

29
00:02:10,418 --> 00:02:13,186
just trying to get an early start

30
00:02:13,221 --> 00:02:14,554
back home to Alabama.

31
00:02:14,589 --> 00:02:15,656
Okay, ma'am.

32
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:16,823
We were at this church convention.

33
00:02:16,858 --> 00:02:18,925
- Ma'am.
- Oh, no, excuse me.

34
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,327
- Ma'am.
- I am not a ma'am.

35
00:02:20,361 --> 00:02:22,863
I am a Miss. Miss Verdene.

36
00:02:22,897 --> 00:02:24,698
Miss Verdene, well, I am Dr. Bloom,

37
00:02:24,732 --> 00:02:25,699
and this here is Nurse Brunstetter.

38
00:02:25,733 --> 00:02:27,834
And they're gonna take care
of your lacerations.

39
00:02:27,869 --> 00:02:28,877
Okay, thank you.

40
00:02:28,912 --> 00:02:30,504
Okay, let's expose the skin,

41
00:02:30,538 --> 00:02:32,406
irrigate the wounds,
and set up a suture tray.

42
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,540
Yeah.

43
00:02:33,574 --> 00:02:35,609
This is Kaye Henry,
restrained driver of the van.

44
00:02:35,643 --> 00:02:37,377
Airbag deployed resulting
in chemical burns

45
00:02:37,412 --> 00:02:38,478
and a bleeding nose.

46
00:02:38,513 --> 00:02:40,947
We're from Holy Gethsemane
Christian Fellowship.

47
00:02:40,982 --> 00:02:42,883
Everybody from our group has insurance.

48
00:02:42,917 --> 00:02:44,584
- That's okay.
- No, we can pay.

49
00:02:44,619 --> 00:02:46,853
Well, today, I am fixing
broken noses for free.

50
00:02:46,888 --> 00:02:47,821
Bay 24.

51
00:02:47,855 --> 00:02:50,290
40-year-old woman in respiratory arrest.

52
00:02:50,324 --> 00:02:51,792
Seriously? Let me guess.

53
00:02:51,826 --> 00:02:53,427
Restrained passenger in MVA.

54
00:02:53,461 --> 00:02:55,562
Please, somebody help her!

55
00:02:55,596 --> 00:02:57,864
Can someone please help with her leg?

56
00:02:57,899 --> 00:03:00,233
Please, please, someone.

57
00:03:00,268 --> 00:03:01,568
Please, please, don't let her die.

58
00:03:01,602 --> 00:03:03,770
Mariana? Mariana, bay 26.

59
00:03:03,805 --> 00:03:05,639
Pneumothorax, let's place a chest tube.

60
00:03:05,673 --> 00:03:08,542
Someone, please, please, help her.

61
00:03:08,576 --> 00:03:10,477
Please don't let her die.
Lottie's got babies at home.

62
00:03:10,511 --> 00:03:11,578
All right. All right.

63
00:03:11,612 --> 00:03:13,246
- Why's it so hard?
- Okay, ladies, I need for you

64
00:03:13,281 --> 00:03:14,881
both to breathe for me, okay?

65
00:03:16,918 --> 00:03:19,553
Turan, compartment syndrome.

66
00:03:19,587 --> 00:03:22,889
Measure lower right extremity
for anterior pressure.

67
00:03:22,924 --> 00:03:25,058
I'm not getting a good seal.

68
00:03:25,093 --> 00:03:27,060
Mariana, angle the tube posteriorly

69
00:03:27,095 --> 00:03:28,246
for better blood evacuation.

70
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,362
Yes.

71
00:03:29,397 --> 00:03:30,897
- Okay, Nurse Jackson.
- I'm right here.

72
00:03:30,932 --> 00:03:32,299
Nurse Jackson, let's get this going.

73
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:33,433
Where's my cane?

74
00:03:33,468 --> 00:03:34,935
All right, how you feeling, Kaye?

75
00:03:34,969 --> 00:03:35,969
- Okay.
- Good?

76
00:03:36,003 --> 00:03:37,971
- Yeah.
- Okay, keep that... that's right.

77
00:03:38,005 --> 00:03:39,005
That's right.

78
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,440
Chest pressure's equalizing.

79
00:03:40,475 --> 00:03:42,609
- Great.
- Bloom, leg pressure's 40.

80
00:03:42,643 --> 00:03:44,811
Okay, do a fasciotomy
using the two incision

81
00:03:44,846 --> 00:03:45,912
four compartment technique.

82
00:03:45,947 --> 00:03:47,647
- I need my cane.
- Ow, it hurts.

83
00:03:47,682 --> 00:03:49,015
All right, Kaye.

84
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,817
First time you've broken a bone?

85
00:03:50,852 --> 00:03:52,419
- Yeah.
- All right.

86
00:03:52,453 --> 00:03:54,755
This is gonna hurt,
hopefully not too much.

87
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:55,756
Okay.

88
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,991
- Auntie Kaye.
- Chante!

89
00:03:58,025 --> 00:03:59,426
- That's my niece.
- Kaye.

90
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,583
- You need to relax.
- I need to get to her.

91
00:04:00,617 --> 00:04:01,762
Auntie Kaye, where are you?

92
00:04:01,796 --> 00:04:02,963
Restrained passenger in the MVA.

93
00:04:02,997 --> 00:04:04,931
She has chest bruising from the seatbelt.

94
00:04:04,966 --> 00:04:06,700
My chest really hurts.

95
00:04:06,734 --> 00:04:08,034
Okay, we're gonna take a look at that.

96
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:09,936
Let's move Chante to a side bay

97
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:12,038
and get chest x-rays,
both PA and lateral.

98
00:04:12,073 --> 00:04:13,306
Okay.

99
00:04:13,341 --> 00:04:14,474
She's been sick the last few days.

100
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:16,309
- Nausea, vomiting.
- Kaye, I got her.

101
00:04:16,344 --> 00:04:17,410
I promise.

102
00:04:17,445 --> 00:04:18,812
The best way for you
to take care of her right now

103
00:04:18,846 --> 00:04:20,046
is to take care of yourself.

104
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:21,948
All right? You need to rest.

105
00:04:21,983 --> 00:04:24,317
Alfreeda Watson, 54-year-old...

106
00:04:24,352 --> 00:04:25,652
Restrained passenger in MVA.

107
00:04:25,686 --> 00:04:26,887
- Got it.
- Her leg was trapped

108
00:04:26,921 --> 00:04:27,921
under the seat in front of her.

109
00:04:27,955 --> 00:04:30,557
Okay, Ms. Watson,
does your... does your leg hurt?

110
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,825
Well, it ain't childbirth,

111
00:04:31,859 --> 00:04:33,960
but I suppose it does ache a touch.

112
00:04:33,995 --> 00:04:35,061
Now, I'm not one to complain,

113
00:04:35,096 --> 00:04:37,531
but I think that New York is
tired of all us ladies

114
00:04:37,565 --> 00:04:38,665
here from Alabama.

115
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:39,835
Uh, bay 28.

116
00:04:39,869 --> 00:04:42,736
Let's get some x-rays and page Kapoor.

117
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:43,970
- Looks like nerve damage.
- Dr. Bloom?

118
00:04:44,005 --> 00:04:45,038
- Dr. Bloom.
- Yes?

119
00:04:45,072 --> 00:04:45,972
Yes?

120
00:04:46,007 --> 00:04:50,510
Your nurse cut
my blouse... brand new blouse

121
00:04:50,545 --> 00:04:52,479
- clean off of me.
- And I've apologized several times.

122
00:04:52,513 --> 00:04:55,015
- Okay, Miss Verdene...
- It was a final call sale.

123
00:04:55,049 --> 00:04:57,651
Now, what are they gonna do about that?

124
00:04:57,685 --> 00:04:59,786
They're stitching up my face.
They're gonna stitch up my shirt.

125
00:04:59,821 --> 00:05:01,354
Uh, Brunstetter, what have you got?

126
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:03,156
Sister Mary Joseph node.

127
00:05:03,191 --> 00:05:04,825
Good find. Okay, let's page Sharpe.

128
00:05:04,859 --> 00:05:06,393
Bloom, pressure's bottoming out!

129
00:05:06,427 --> 00:05:07,527
- I'm gonna be right back.
- What?

130
00:05:07,562 --> 00:05:09,429
Someone, I need my cane.

131
00:05:09,463 --> 00:05:11,431
Restrained passenger,
hit her head during an MVA.

132
00:05:11,465 --> 00:05:12,999
And this fool done put an ice pack on it.

133
00:05:13,034 --> 00:05:15,001
- You're in pain.
- But the damn thing leaked.

134
00:05:15,036 --> 00:05:16,903
It's full of all kinds
of fake-ass chemicals.

135
00:05:16,938 --> 00:05:17,904
Okay, we're gonna irrigate your head,

136
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:19,573
make sure all the chemicals
are washed away.

137
00:05:19,607 --> 00:05:20,907
Irrigate? Oh, no, ma'am.

138
00:05:20,942 --> 00:05:22,576
- This is not wet and wild hair.
- Brunstetter!

139
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:23,844
Okay, this is Nurse Brunstetter,

140
00:05:23,878 --> 00:05:24,878
and they're gonna take great care of you.

141
00:05:24,912 --> 00:05:25,879
- Bloom.
- Ooh.

142
00:05:25,913 --> 00:05:27,113
I can't wait to get back home.

143
00:05:27,148 --> 00:05:28,381
Take a look at this.

144
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,851
She's hemodynamically unstable.

145
00:05:30,885 --> 00:05:32,853
SVT. We need to cardiovert her.

146
00:05:32,887 --> 00:05:34,421
Come on.

147
00:05:34,455 --> 00:05:36,486
She's in defib. Charged.

148
00:05:37,158 --> 00:05:38,692
Clear.

149
00:05:38,726 --> 00:05:40,894
Go again, increase to 150 joules.

150
00:05:40,928 --> 00:05:42,128
- Charged.
- Clear.

151
00:05:43,731 --> 00:05:46,533
- We have sinus rhythm.
- Back to normal rhythm.

152
00:05:46,567 --> 00:05:48,869
Blood pressure's rising.

153
00:05:48,903 --> 00:05:51,037
All right, vitals are stabilizing.

154
00:05:51,072 --> 00:05:53,540
Casey, pull up the portable
chest X-ray that you did.

155
00:05:56,577 --> 00:05:57,978
What are you thinking?

156
00:05:58,012 --> 00:06:00,780
EKG is showing low voltage
in the lateral leads.

157
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,217
Cardiac tamponade,
probably from that right there

158
00:06:04,252 --> 00:06:05,218
on the chest X-ray.

159
00:06:05,253 --> 00:06:06,820
- What?
- There's a shadow.

160
00:06:06,854 --> 00:06:07,954
Contusion?

161
00:06:07,989 --> 00:06:09,556
It's more like a mass.

162
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:10,991
Let's put Zoll Padz on her chest

163
00:06:11,025 --> 00:06:12,659
to shock her heart
back to a regular rhythm

164
00:06:12,693 --> 00:06:14,895
next time it goes off and page Reynolds.

If one were more conspiratorially minded,

167
00:07:04,251 --> 00:07:06,819
one might think that you were
actually trying to avoid me.

168
00:07:06,853 --> 00:07:08,687
Uh-uh.

169
00:07:08,722 --> 00:07:10,756
- Rough night?
- You could say that again.

170
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:13,592
Well, surely not because
of this adorable munchkin.

171
00:07:13,627 --> 00:07:16,595
Yeah, well, to her credit,
it does take commitment

172
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,064
to sustain six straight hours
of screaming.

173
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:20,666
Well, like her father,

174
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,868
it would appear that she's
only content inside a hospital.

175
00:07:22,903 --> 00:07:24,670
Yeah, cruel, cruel irony.

176
00:07:24,704 --> 00:07:26,539
Let me help. I mean, after work,

177
00:07:26,573 --> 00:07:28,007
I could take her for a couple of hours,

178
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,074
give you some me time.

179
00:07:29,109 --> 00:07:30,843
That's very kind,
but I couldn't ask that of you.

180
00:07:30,877 --> 00:07:32,177
What if I insisted?

181
00:07:32,212 --> 00:07:33,546
Yeah, thanks anyways,

182
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,014
but we kind of got a whole system going.

183
00:07:35,048 --> 00:07:37,917
So we're good... for the most part.

184
00:07:42,055 --> 00:07:43,989
You're right, looks like a mass.

185
00:07:44,758 --> 00:07:46,759
Well, based on the size,
she's had it for a while.

186
00:07:46,793 --> 00:07:47,860
Any of these women know
her health history?

187
00:07:47,894 --> 00:07:50,195
- Not that I can figure out.
- Where'd you want me?

188
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,897
Sister Mary Joseph node in bay 29.

189
00:07:51,932 --> 00:07:53,065
Let's take her up.

190
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:54,934
Dr. Bloom, point me.

191
00:07:54,968 --> 00:07:57,269
Uh, bay 28, nerve damage.

192
00:07:59,072 --> 00:08:02,041
Okay, Ms. Watson, I'm Dr. Kapoor.

193
00:08:02,075 --> 00:08:04,743
I realize it might not look this way now,

194
00:08:04,778 --> 00:08:08,080
but you ladies really were lucky,

195
00:08:08,114 --> 00:08:10,716
considering that there were
so many of you in the van.

196
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,217
So because I'm a black woman, I must be

197
00:08:12,252 --> 00:08:14,687
with all the other black women
you got up in here?

198
00:08:15,822 --> 00:08:17,990
No, that... not... that's not what I...

199
00:08:18,024 --> 00:08:19,224
what I meant was...

200
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:21,727
Relax, I'm with them.

201
00:08:22,277 --> 00:08:23,729
But you should see your face.

202
00:08:23,763 --> 00:08:25,130
It's like you caught
a spirit or something.

203
00:08:25,165 --> 00:08:26,999
Is that a bad thing?

204
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:28,934
Depends on what you say about my foot.

205
00:08:31,004 --> 00:08:34,000
Well, your foot is not broken,

206
00:08:34,034 --> 00:08:35,608
but the swelling is troubling.

207
00:08:35,642 --> 00:08:36,709
Yeah, well, that's nothing new.

208
00:08:36,743 --> 00:08:39,411
As long as I can walk
my fields, I'm fine enough.

209
00:08:39,446 --> 00:08:40,679
You're a farmer?

210
00:08:40,714 --> 00:08:42,648
Fourth generation, soybeans,

211
00:08:42,682 --> 00:08:44,416
when the foot isn't giving me the blues.

212
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:46,986
Have you seen a doctor about this?

213
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,420
You doctors want so much out of pocket,

214
00:08:48,455 --> 00:08:50,122
and I make too much for Medicaid.

215
00:08:50,156 --> 00:08:54,026
So I figure I just ride it out
until I qualify for Medicare.

216
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,362
Unfortunately, riding it out
is not an option.

217
00:08:56,396 --> 00:08:59,131
I need to ask a colleague
to evaluate it further.

218
00:08:59,165 --> 00:09:00,966
Have a good day.

219
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,774
I know you. What's your name?

220
00:09:08,808 --> 00:09:09,775
Dr. Sharpe.

221
00:09:09,809 --> 00:09:12,111
No, no, that isn't it.

222
00:09:12,145 --> 00:09:13,567
Dr. Helen.

223
00:09:13,608 --> 00:09:15,814
You come on after my stories sometimes.

224
00:09:15,849 --> 00:09:17,282
- Don't play.
- Okay, yes.

225
00:09:17,317 --> 00:09:20,119
I knew it, Dr. Helen.

226
00:09:20,153 --> 00:09:21,387
Fancy cancer doctor.

227
00:09:21,421 --> 00:09:23,088
Oh, wait.

228
00:09:23,723 --> 00:09:25,658
Are you here because I got cancer?

229
00:09:25,692 --> 00:09:27,059
Verdene, you don't have cancer.

230
00:09:27,093 --> 00:09:28,394
Miss Verdene.

231
00:09:28,428 --> 00:09:30,462
Miss Verdene, you don't have cancer.

232
00:09:30,497 --> 00:09:32,297
You gonna swear on them chunky earrings

233
00:09:32,332 --> 00:09:33,666
you love wearing?

234
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,701
No, they're not that big, are they?

235
00:09:38,038 --> 00:09:40,139
Miss Verdene, may I?

236
00:09:40,855 --> 00:09:42,708
- This reddish lump...
- Mm-hmm.

237
00:09:42,742 --> 00:09:44,810
Next to your belly button
is rather concerning.

238
00:09:44,844 --> 00:09:46,845
It indicates an infection
in your lymph nodes.

239
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,182
So what's that mean?
Antibiotics, a cream?

240
00:09:50,216 --> 00:09:51,316
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

241
00:09:51,351 --> 00:09:53,318
The infection's being
complicated by your diabetes.

242
00:09:53,353 --> 00:09:57,156
I got diabetes too?
Talk about buzzard luck.

243
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:59,692
My father lost a foot to sugar.

244
00:09:59,726 --> 00:10:01,827
When was your last checkup?

245
00:10:01,861 --> 00:10:04,930
Well, they closed
the nearest hospital to me.

246
00:10:04,964 --> 00:10:06,765
Take me at least an hour to get to one.

247
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,001
Now, who got time to drive two hours

248
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:12,371
round trip on top of an appointment?

249
00:10:12,405 --> 00:10:13,763
Hmm.

250
00:10:18,478 --> 00:10:20,946
Miss Verdene.

251
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,881
I'm gonna go get my colleague
to come and see you.

252
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,216
Why?

253
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,751
I think you just had a seizure.

254
00:10:27,987 --> 00:10:30,389
- Vijay.
- Oh, good.

255
00:10:30,423 --> 00:10:33,225
I have a black female,
54, farmer, dry sense of humor,

256
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:35,861
presenting asymptomatic
lower extremity edema.

257
00:10:35,895 --> 00:10:37,863
Black female, 52, restaurant worker,

258
00:10:37,897 --> 00:10:40,399
cutting fashion sense,
presenting with petit mal seizures

259
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:41,800
and untreated diabetes.

260
00:10:41,835 --> 00:10:43,293
Okay.

261
00:10:44,471 --> 00:10:46,305
All right, I'm gonna need
a sternotomy tray,

262
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:48,207
a sternal saw, and hand me the echo.

Oh, she was almost to the bridge.

276
00:11:21,341 --> 00:11:23,408
You're interested in learning
to become a surgeon today,

277
00:11:23,443 --> 00:11:24,476
Dr. Duke?

278
00:11:24,511 --> 00:11:27,412
- She was singing...
- Get your head in the game.

279
00:11:27,447 --> 00:11:29,481
Ten blade, please. Thank you.

280
00:11:29,516 --> 00:11:31,917
We are ecstatic to be considered

281
00:11:31,951 --> 00:11:32,985
as adoption candidates.

282
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:34,153
Believe me.

283
00:11:34,187 --> 00:11:36,855
It's just that to come
in... for us to in come tomorrow,

284
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,524
I don't know my... um,

285
00:11:38,558 --> 00:11:40,359
I don't know
my husband's schedule, really,

286
00:11:40,393 --> 00:11:42,027
and I don't wanna spring
anything on him...

287
00:11:42,061 --> 00:11:43,595
on his schedule, I mean.

288
00:11:46,332 --> 00:11:48,534
Oh, I see.

289
00:11:48,568 --> 00:11:50,169
I see.

290
00:11:50,203 --> 00:11:51,236
No. No, no, no, no.

291
00:11:51,271 --> 00:11:53,272
No, if tomorrow at 4:00 is
the only time you have,

292
00:11:53,306 --> 00:11:55,440
then we will make it work on our end.

293
00:11:55,475 --> 00:11:57,876
Right.

294
00:11:57,911 --> 00:11:59,511
Yes, thank you.

295
00:11:59,546 --> 00:12:01,480
No, we look forward to meeting you.

296
00:12:01,514 --> 00:12:03,115
Okay.

297
00:12:07,353 --> 00:12:09,621
Well done, Iggy.

298
00:12:09,656 --> 00:12:11,990
Hi, Chante, I'm Doctor Frome.

299
00:12:12,025 --> 00:12:13,125
I work here at the hospital.

300
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:14,960
Is it finally my X-ray time?

301
00:12:14,994 --> 00:12:18,564
No, it is not finally your X-ray time,

302
00:12:18,598 --> 00:12:21,400
because I have one or two questions

303
00:12:21,434 --> 00:12:23,535
that I'd like to ask you first,
if that's okay with you.

304
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,537
Where's your white coat?

305
00:12:25,572 --> 00:12:28,006
The white coat, um, I don't know.

306
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,208
You know, I haven't worn
that thing in a long time,

307
00:12:29,242 --> 00:12:31,510
because I find that it makes
people feel more comfortable

308
00:12:31,544 --> 00:12:33,245
when I don't wear it.

309
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,149
Plus, if I'm being honest,
I'm a super messy eater.

310
00:12:37,183 --> 00:12:38,650
So lame.

311
00:12:38,685 --> 00:12:40,052
You're crazy.

312
00:12:40,086 --> 00:12:41,587
You're definitely not the first person

313
00:12:41,621 --> 00:12:42,588
to tell me that.

314
00:12:42,622 --> 00:12:44,056
So when's the X-ray?

315
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:45,490
Well, Chante,

316
00:12:45,525 --> 00:12:48,927
um, we can't give you an X-ray,

317
00:12:48,962 --> 00:12:51,129
because you are pregnant.

318
00:12:52,365 --> 00:12:54,399
We give a blood test to women
who don't know

319
00:12:54,434 --> 00:12:57,069
if they're pregnant
before we give them an X-ray.

320
00:12:58,471 --> 00:13:01,173
Because an X-ray can harm the fetus.

321
00:13:02,475 --> 00:13:04,610
Do you understand what it means
to be pregnant?

322
00:13:05,604 --> 00:13:07,346
I have a baby in me?

323
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,081
Am I in trouble?

324
00:13:09,115 --> 00:13:10,549
No, you're not in trouble.

325
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:12,184
No, you're not in trouble at all.

326
00:13:12,218 --> 00:13:15,520
Um, did you know that you were pregnant?

327
00:13:15,555 --> 00:13:18,423
- Maybe.
- Did you plan this?

328
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,463
Um, was the sex consensual?
Did you want to have sex?

329
00:13:24,497 --> 00:13:26,899
Who doesn't wanna have sex?

330
00:13:26,933 --> 00:13:29,601
I like sex. Do you like sex?

331
00:13:29,636 --> 00:13:32,971
Do I like sex? Um, sure.

332
00:13:33,006 --> 00:13:36,074
Sex is great. Wow.

333
00:13:36,109 --> 00:13:38,143
Yeah, okay.

334
00:13:38,177 --> 00:13:40,045
Okay, yeah. That's healthy.

335
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,713
There's nothing wrong with liking sex.

336
00:13:41,748 --> 00:13:45,050
I just need to make sure
that nobody did anything to you

337
00:13:45,084 --> 00:13:46,585
that you didn't want.

338
00:13:46,619 --> 00:13:47,953
I wanted to,

339
00:13:47,987 --> 00:13:49,554
and my boyfriend was a scaredy-cat.

340
00:13:49,589 --> 00:13:51,056
He forgot the condom.

341
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:53,592
Yeah, condom's pretty important.

342
00:13:53,626 --> 00:13:55,093
Let me ask you this.

343
00:13:55,128 --> 00:13:57,612
Do you have a plan with your pregnancy?

344
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,400
I want an abortion.

345
00:14:04,437 --> 00:14:06,939
Do you understand what that means?

346
00:14:06,973 --> 00:14:10,142
I don't wanna... I don't wanna
have a baby.

347
00:14:13,446 --> 00:14:15,647
Sorry for the impromptu music.

348
00:14:15,682 --> 00:14:17,416
My mom used to sing
"His Eye is on the Sparrow",

349
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:18,583
like, every Sunday.

350
00:14:18,618 --> 00:14:22,321
Yeah, after church, it was
laundry, singing, and folding.

351
00:14:22,355 --> 00:14:23,811
Angle that light for me.

352
00:14:23,845 --> 00:14:26,458
She was choir section leader
before she got sick.

353
00:14:26,492 --> 00:14:29,428
The altos, music, church,
it meant a lot to her.

354
00:14:29,462 --> 00:14:31,363
Dr. Duke, I am fully aware
of the relationship

355
00:14:31,397 --> 00:14:33,265
between black women and church.

356
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:34,967
They're everywhere but the pulpit.

357
00:14:35,001 --> 00:14:36,948
My mom doesn't let me miss a Sunday,

358
00:14:36,983 --> 00:14:38,776
but that's on Sunday.

359
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,306
Can I have the cardioplegic
solution sent down?

360
00:14:44,377 --> 00:14:46,949
- Ah, damn it.
- What's wrong?

361
00:14:46,984 --> 00:14:48,480
The mass causing the tamponade has grown

362
00:14:48,514 --> 00:14:49,614
through the chamber wall.

363
00:14:49,649 --> 00:14:51,016
Where is the echo I asked for?

364
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,351
On its way from Hastings' surgery.

365
00:14:52,385 --> 00:14:53,685
Get it here now.

366
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,220
Can you do a resection to remove it?

367
00:14:55,254 --> 00:14:56,388
The way it's positioned posteriorly,

368
00:14:56,422 --> 00:14:58,123
I have to remove the heart entirely

369
00:14:58,157 --> 00:14:59,291
and then resect the mass.

370
00:14:59,325 --> 00:15:01,126
And then put the heart back in?

371
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,795
Prep the SCS bath on the back table.

372
00:15:10,503 --> 00:15:12,637
Ms. Henry, I'm Dr. Goodwin.

373
00:15:12,672 --> 00:15:15,507
I just wanted you to know
that everyone in your group

374
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:18,643
has stabilized except for Tamala Robeson.

375
00:15:18,678 --> 00:15:21,046
Her family's so worried. How is...

376
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,357
- Whoop, you okay?
- I'm fine.

377
00:15:22,392 --> 00:15:23,482
- Why don't we take a seat?
- I'm fine.

378
00:15:23,516 --> 00:15:24,616
Why don't we have a seat?

379
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,318
- No, I'm fine, really.
- Why don't we have a seat?

380
00:15:26,352 --> 00:15:27,486
Tell me about Tamala.

381
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,321
There was a complication.

382
00:15:29,355 --> 00:15:30,756
During surgery, we found a tumor,

383
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,391
and it was there long before the crash,

384
00:15:32,425 --> 00:15:35,694
but it has penetrated her heart.

385
00:15:35,728 --> 00:15:38,076
So there's a number of things we can
do, but I need you to understand

386
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:41,799
that your friend is facing
a very high-risk operation.

387
00:15:42,402 --> 00:15:46,104
Well, it's covered.
Anything she needs is covered.

388
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:49,241
I organized our trip.
It's all right here.

389
00:15:49,275 --> 00:15:50,442
Look.

390
00:15:50,892 --> 00:15:52,344
When we rented the van,

391
00:15:52,378 --> 00:15:54,613
we paid for the personal injury
insurance.

392
00:15:54,647 --> 00:15:56,669
I've read the policy, there's no limit.

393
00:15:56,703 --> 00:16:00,419
So she's entitled to
the best care you can offer.

394
00:16:00,453 --> 00:16:02,387
- Hmm.
- The very best.

395
00:16:02,422 --> 00:16:05,690
And I made everyone pay the extra $7.50

396
00:16:05,725 --> 00:16:06,691
for the insurance.

397
00:16:06,726 --> 00:16:08,226
They carried on a while, but...

398
00:16:08,261 --> 00:16:09,628
Well, I'm sure they're thanking you now.

399
00:16:12,331 --> 00:16:17,069
Dr. Goodwin, would you be
open to praying with me?

400
00:16:18,438 --> 00:16:22,240
Um, I'm not really the most

401
00:16:22,275 --> 00:16:24,476
prayerful of guys.

402
00:16:28,781 --> 00:16:30,489
Sure.

403
00:16:35,855 --> 00:16:39,758
Heavenly father
from whom all blessings flow.

404
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:43,428
It was your will to work
through this accident.

405
00:16:43,463 --> 00:16:45,297
Bless the hands of these surgeons

406
00:16:45,331 --> 00:16:47,232
as they do your work.

407
00:16:47,266 --> 00:16:50,836
We are your instruments, Lord,
prayerful or not.

408
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:53,672
Bless us and show us the way.

409
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,112
Lucky the accident happened
so close to us.

410
00:17:00,146 --> 00:17:01,246
Mm.

411
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,148
Some are calling it an act of God.

412
00:17:03,182 --> 00:17:04,468
What do you think?

413
00:17:04,502 --> 00:17:06,151
Well, all I know is that

414
00:17:06,185 --> 00:17:07,486
half these women came in with a host

415
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,154
of preexisting conditions,

416
00:17:09,188 --> 00:17:11,690
diabetes, cervical cancer, hypertension.

417
00:17:11,724 --> 00:17:13,859
And then they crash
right when they need care most.

418
00:17:13,893 --> 00:17:15,627
I don't know. I'm a cynic.

419
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:18,864
I mean, maybe it was divine intervention.

420
00:17:18,898 --> 00:17:20,832
Yeah.

421
00:17:20,867 --> 00:17:23,535
Maybe there was an intervention.

422
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:25,604
I just don't know if it was divine.

423
00:17:46,514 --> 00:17:47,815
Is there an update?

424
00:17:47,849 --> 00:17:49,550
Uh, no update.

425
00:17:49,584 --> 00:17:53,055
I just, uh... do you mind if I sit?

426
00:17:56,958 --> 00:18:01,896
Um... I met this woman once,

427
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:04,998
and the amazing thing about her was that

428
00:18:05,033 --> 00:18:09,503
she loved her friends...
more than anything.

429
00:18:10,905 --> 00:18:13,574
And her friends were in trouble,

430
00:18:13,608 --> 00:18:14,761
through no fault of their own.

431
00:18:14,795 --> 00:18:16,844
They couldn't get the care
that they needed.

432
00:18:16,878 --> 00:18:21,582
So she decided that she was
gonna help her friends...

433
00:18:22,984 --> 00:18:24,785
No matter what.

434
00:18:27,222 --> 00:18:29,592
So she did something dangerous.

435
00:18:30,825 --> 00:18:33,560
And I would never tell you her name,

436
00:18:33,595 --> 00:18:37,531
because I don't wanna get her in trouble.

437
00:18:39,634 --> 00:18:41,270
Because I respect her.

438
00:18:43,647 --> 00:18:45,639
I expect she appreciates that.

439
00:18:48,643 --> 00:18:52,546
But I do have a question for her.

440
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,495
How did things get so bad

441
00:18:58,453 --> 00:19:00,120
that the only way she saw
to save her friends

442
00:19:00,155 --> 00:19:02,823
was to crash their van?

443
00:19:09,197 --> 00:19:12,134
Perhaps it's what this woman saw.

444
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:17,938
She had a friend who used to
love going for walks.

445
00:19:19,274 --> 00:19:21,268
Now she can't breathe.

446
00:19:21,843 --> 00:19:24,778
One's in and out of a wheelchair,

447
00:19:24,812 --> 00:19:26,914
another died too early.

448
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:32,920
This woman sees it all,
sees her friends at church,

449
00:19:33,489 --> 00:19:36,657
praying for the hospitals to return,

450
00:19:36,951 --> 00:19:39,161
for money to buy medicine,

451
00:19:39,727 --> 00:19:42,873
for deliverance slow to come.

452
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,267
So maybe she prays
for something different,

453
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,772
for the strength to act,

454
00:19:51,806 --> 00:19:53,717
for a sign,

455
00:19:54,742 --> 00:19:56,610
and she gets nothing.

456
00:19:59,147 --> 00:20:03,817
Until a nice young man
at a van rental office

457
00:20:03,851 --> 00:20:08,689
offers to sell her supplemental
injury insurance.

458
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:15,896
You spend your life wondering
what salvation will cost,

459
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:20,767
and the answer turns out to be $7.50.

460
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:26,959
All I had to do was one scary thing...

461
00:20:28,076 --> 00:20:30,379
And all our prayers were answered.

462
00:20:31,714 --> 00:20:35,148
"So do not fear, for I am with you.

463
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:39,180
"Do not be dismayed, for I am your God.

464
00:20:40,264 --> 00:20:44,057
"I will strengthen and help you.

465
00:20:44,518 --> 00:20:48,996
I will uphold you
with my righteous right hand."

466
00:20:50,898 --> 00:20:52,651
Meaning God will see you through?

467
00:20:53,527 --> 00:20:55,269
Meaning sometimes

468
00:20:55,303 --> 00:20:58,538
you wait for the right hand of God,

469
00:20:58,573 --> 00:21:01,275
but sometimes the hand is you.

470
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:09,850
So me losing my concentration
is me having a seizure?

471
00:21:09,884 --> 00:21:11,038
In some cases.

472
00:21:11,072 --> 00:21:13,587
Petit mal seizures present
in different ways.

473
00:21:13,621 --> 00:21:15,589
And this is from the diabetes too?

474
00:21:15,623 --> 00:21:17,924
Uncontrolled diabetes
puts you at a high risk

475
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:19,726
for strokes and other diseases.

476
00:21:19,761 --> 00:21:22,062
You should not drive until
you get this under control.

477
00:21:22,096 --> 00:21:23,864
Well, if I can't drive,
how am I supposed to get

478
00:21:23,898 --> 00:21:24,965
to a doctor for help?

479
00:21:24,999 --> 00:21:26,033
A church member can't drive you?

480
00:21:26,067 --> 00:21:27,601
An hour each way?

481
00:21:27,635 --> 00:21:28,669
Perhaps family?

482
00:21:28,703 --> 00:21:32,372
No one I can rely on.
I'm always bailing them out.

483
00:21:34,842 --> 00:21:36,109
So what am I dying of?

484
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:39,646
Miss Alfreeda, you're not dying.

485
00:21:39,681 --> 00:21:41,533
Tell that to your face.

486
00:21:43,284 --> 00:21:45,085
The swelling in your leg,

487
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:47,888
we thought that it might be
cancer or a blood disorder,

488
00:21:47,922 --> 00:21:48,986
but it's neither.

489
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,957
It's your kidneys. They're failing.

490
00:21:50,992 --> 00:21:52,326
So I am dying.

491
00:21:52,836 --> 00:21:55,662
Well, your GFR is 16,

492
00:21:55,697 --> 00:21:57,998
which means that the creatinine
isn't clearing

493
00:21:58,032 --> 00:21:59,147
from your kidney,

494
00:21:59,181 --> 00:22:00,901
which means you need a new kidney.

495
00:22:00,935 --> 00:22:02,803
Well, it's a good thing
I brought a spare.

496
00:22:04,339 --> 00:22:07,808
Well, you did bring a vanload
of potential donors.

497
00:22:07,842 --> 00:22:10,177
You want me to take a kidney
from one of my church members?

498
00:22:10,211 --> 00:22:12,813
A blood relative would be better, though.

499
00:22:13,139 --> 00:22:14,506
Do you have any family?

500
00:22:15,817 --> 00:22:18,785
No, I don't have any family here.

501
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,788
Stop telling tales.
I'm her much younger sister.

502
00:22:21,823 --> 00:22:24,691
Right. I forgot about her.

503
00:22:24,726 --> 00:22:26,093
See... you see how she is?

504
00:22:26,127 --> 00:22:27,361
I was gonna do the Christian thing

505
00:22:27,395 --> 00:22:29,096
and offer up one of my kidneys,

506
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:31,131
but I ain't doing it now unless she asks

507
00:22:31,165 --> 00:22:32,199
- for once in her life.
- Nobody is asking you

508
00:22:32,233 --> 00:22:33,333
for anything.

509
00:22:33,368 --> 00:22:34,768
Like, when I helped you keep

510
00:22:34,802 --> 00:22:36,203
Mom and Daddy's farm last year.

511
00:22:36,237 --> 00:22:37,771
Go ahead, tell the truth.
Shame the devil.

512
00:22:37,805 --> 00:22:39,339
You know what? That's right, baby sister.

513
00:22:39,374 --> 00:22:42,008
Go on, keep Christ
in your heart and your kidney,

514
00:22:42,043 --> 00:22:43,810
because I don't want nothing from you.

515
00:22:47,915 --> 00:22:49,950
We'll have only two hours for this.

516
00:22:49,984 --> 00:22:51,651
Why is that, Dr. Duke?

517
00:22:51,686 --> 00:22:53,720
Because we're harvesting
the patient's own heart.

518
00:22:53,755 --> 00:22:55,389
After two hours, the organ will degrade

519
00:22:55,423 --> 00:22:56,790
beyond viability.

520
00:22:56,824 --> 00:22:57,824
And the mass?

521
00:22:57,859 --> 00:23:01,294
Is presenting posterior
as a left atrial mass.

522
00:23:01,329 --> 00:23:02,896
And I can resect it with clean margins

523
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:05,399
in about 45 minutes, maybe another 45

524
00:23:05,433 --> 00:23:06,967
to restructure the heart muscle.

525
00:23:07,001 --> 00:23:08,135
That leaves you with 30 minutes

526
00:23:08,169 --> 00:23:10,303
to sew it back in and warm the trunk.

527
00:23:10,338 --> 00:23:11,972
Is there enough time for that?

528
00:23:12,006 --> 00:23:13,874
Sitting about 4 degrees Celsius.

529
00:23:13,908 --> 00:23:15,627
Okay.

530
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:19,146
All right, ladies and
gentlemen, listen up.

531
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:22,509
Now this may be
an atypical surgery for us,

532
00:23:23,284 --> 00:23:26,319
but what is typical is our efficiency

533
00:23:26,354 --> 00:23:28,388
and our precision.

534
00:23:28,423 --> 00:23:30,991
So use them today,

535
00:23:31,025 --> 00:23:33,059
and we may have a chance to save a life.

536
00:23:33,312 --> 00:23:34,828
Okay?

537
00:23:34,862 --> 00:23:36,163
Let's get after it.

538
00:23:36,523 --> 00:23:37,898
You're fully on bypass.

539
00:23:37,932 --> 00:23:40,000
SVC partial dissection complete.

540
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,171
Transecting the ascending aorta.

541
00:23:47,408 --> 00:23:49,709
Pulmonary artery clamped and dissected.

542
00:23:49,744 --> 00:23:51,711
Aortic cross-clamp off.

543
00:23:51,746 --> 00:23:53,280
Removing the heart.

544
00:23:53,314 --> 00:23:55,282
Resection tray right behind you.

545
00:23:55,316 --> 00:23:56,750
Heart is on the move.

546
00:24:03,424 --> 00:24:05,225
Start the clock.

547
00:24:14,502 --> 00:24:18,138
Pregnant? Chante, you pregnant?

548
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:19,906
Yes, ma'am.

549
00:24:21,242 --> 00:24:22,742
Is it Mario?

550
00:24:22,777 --> 00:24:24,044
What'd I tell you about messing around

551
00:24:24,078 --> 00:24:25,879
with that fast-ass boy?

552
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,841
The baby.

553
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:30,383
Is the baby okay?
What with the accident...

554
00:24:30,418 --> 00:24:33,163
The fetus is totally unharmed
as far as we can tell.

555
00:24:34,188 --> 00:24:37,290
Thank you, Jesus.

556
00:24:37,325 --> 00:24:38,925
Okay.

557
00:24:40,461 --> 00:24:42,496
Okay.

558
00:24:43,006 --> 00:24:44,898
We're gonna figure this out.

559
00:24:44,932 --> 00:24:47,567
I don't wanna be a mommy.

560
00:24:47,602 --> 00:24:50,136
Oh, baby.

561
00:24:50,171 --> 00:24:52,472
I know it may seem scary right now,

562
00:24:52,507 --> 00:24:55,141
but Auntie Kaye will be right here.

563
00:24:55,176 --> 00:24:56,943
I took care of you, didn't I?

564
00:24:56,978 --> 00:24:58,245
We'll get through this.

565
00:24:58,279 --> 00:24:59,606
Ms. Henry.

566
00:25:00,858 --> 00:25:02,816
Chante has expressed
more than not wanting

567
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:03,984
to be a mother.

568
00:25:04,018 --> 00:25:05,151
Meaning?

569
00:25:05,186 --> 00:25:07,254
Well, why don't we let Chante
take this opportunity

570
00:25:07,288 --> 00:25:09,422
to share her feelings?

571
00:25:11,826 --> 00:25:13,593
I want an abortion.

572
00:25:18,466 --> 00:25:20,834
Did you put her up to this?

573
00:25:20,868 --> 00:25:22,936
No, but she is clearly articulating

574
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:25,338
her choice to end this pregnancy.

575
00:25:25,373 --> 00:25:27,274
Then she should have clearly articulated

576
00:25:27,308 --> 00:25:29,042
that I am her legal guardian,

577
00:25:29,076 --> 00:25:31,111
and I am in charge of her decisions,

578
00:25:31,145 --> 00:25:32,612
including her medical ones.

579
00:25:32,647 --> 00:25:34,014
Okay.

580
00:25:34,048 --> 00:25:35,549
I... you need to know that I'm just here

581
00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:37,884
in support of Chante and what she wants.

582
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,120
And it seems like this pregnancy

583
00:25:40,154 --> 00:25:41,254
would be a burden.

584
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:43,523
Because you think we couldn't
care for this baby?

585
00:25:43,558 --> 00:25:44,658
That's not what I'm saying...

586
00:25:44,692 --> 00:25:47,460
We are more than capable
of taking care of our own.

587
00:25:47,495 --> 00:25:50,297
Every child born
into this family is loved

588
00:25:50,331 --> 00:25:52,832
and extremely well taken care of.

589
00:25:52,867 --> 00:25:55,235
Chante's child will be no different.

590
00:25:55,269 --> 00:25:57,337
But is that what's best for Chante?

591
00:25:57,371 --> 00:25:59,973
Based on what,
your 45 minutes of knowing her?

592
00:26:00,007 --> 00:26:00,941
No.

593
00:26:00,975 --> 00:26:02,909
Folks always want you to make a choice,

594
00:26:02,944 --> 00:26:04,411
then look at you funny
when you don't make the choice

595
00:26:04,445 --> 00:26:05,912
they wanted you to make.

596
00:26:05,947 --> 00:26:09,215
One side shakes their heads,
saying you're oppressed,

597
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:11,184
the other filled
with so called "Christians"

598
00:26:11,218 --> 00:26:12,419
who don't give a damn as soon as the baby

599
00:26:12,453 --> 00:26:13,722
gets pushed out.

600
00:26:14,288 --> 00:26:16,323
But let's be clear.

601
00:26:16,357 --> 00:26:18,558
This black family right here

602
00:26:18,593 --> 00:26:21,928
ain't being co-opted
for anyone's crusade.

603
00:26:24,566 --> 00:26:26,232
Oh, Max!

604
00:26:27,368 --> 00:26:29,869
What about if I got you a food service?

605
00:26:29,904 --> 00:26:30,837
Don't need it.

606
00:26:30,871 --> 00:26:32,238
It would take the pressure
off of cooking.

607
00:26:32,273 --> 00:26:34,074
Luna's still bottle feeding, so...

608
00:26:34,108 --> 00:26:35,408
Not for the baby, for you.

609
00:26:35,443 --> 00:26:36,910
- Oh.
- Be my treat.

610
00:26:36,944 --> 00:26:38,945
Yeah, I'm good. I eat most of
my meals at the hospital anyway.

611
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,513
Have you tried
the pretzel and hummus combo?

612
00:26:40,548 --> 00:26:42,515
- It's very...
- Max.

613
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:44,050
I'm good.

614
00:26:44,085 --> 00:26:45,585
Why won't you let me help you?

615
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,920
You know what? How 'bout this?

616
00:26:46,954 --> 00:26:48,888
When I need your help, I'll ask for it.

617
00:26:48,923 --> 00:26:51,925
Speech therapist to distro four.

618
00:26:51,959 --> 00:26:54,561
Speech therapist to distro four.

619
00:26:57,398 --> 00:26:59,366
How's our group?

620
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,569
Most are recovering,
and we've got aftercare plans

621
00:27:02,603 --> 00:27:04,304
for the noncritical ladies...

622
00:27:04,338 --> 00:27:05,691
Are you the medical director?

623
00:27:07,241 --> 00:27:09,609
Is this about my unpaid parking tickets?

624
00:27:09,644 --> 00:27:12,212
We're following up
on the accident on the FDR.

625
00:27:12,246 --> 00:27:14,414
I'm Detective Grove.
This is Detective Vasquez.

626
00:27:14,448 --> 00:27:17,550
Oh, why don't we discuss this outside?

627
00:27:17,585 --> 00:27:19,085
We'd like to have
a conversation with the driver,

628
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,387
Kaye Henry.

629
00:27:20,421 --> 00:27:21,554
Well, she's recovering.

630
00:27:21,589 --> 00:27:23,923
If she's awake and conscious,
we wanna talk to her.

631
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:25,492
And if she isn't, we'll wait.

632
00:27:40,138 --> 00:27:41,811
Kaye, the police are here
to speak to you.

633
00:27:43,646 --> 00:27:45,947
You understand there will be
repercussions

634
00:27:45,981 --> 00:27:48,783
if they find out the crash
was intentional.

635
00:27:48,818 --> 00:27:50,785
And the only option is to tell the truth.

636
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,121
So what are you saying?

637
00:27:53,488 --> 00:27:55,690
That I don't want you to go to jail

638
00:27:55,991 --> 00:27:58,660
or your friends to lose their insurance.

639
00:28:01,564 --> 00:28:03,698
But they didn't do anything wrong.

640
00:28:03,732 --> 00:28:05,533
They don't even know what I did.

641
00:28:06,293 --> 00:28:07,836
It doesn't matter.

642
00:28:08,295 --> 00:28:10,805
Deliberate actions negate
the policy you purchased.

643
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,946
For a while there,

644
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:21,415
I really thought I was doing God's will.

645
00:28:23,085 --> 00:28:27,221
But this and Chante...

646
00:28:28,423 --> 00:28:29,983
I was all wrong.

647
00:28:34,396 --> 00:28:37,932
Now it's time to do right, Dr. Goodwin.

648
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:41,402
This isn't in my hands, never was.

649
00:28:41,436 --> 00:28:43,571
Kaye, what are you gonna tell the police?

650
00:29:04,126 --> 00:29:07,862
I continue to be thrilled
that I am an only child.

651
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:09,730
What do you mean?

652
00:29:09,765 --> 00:29:11,932
Verdene and Alfreeda letting
decades old personal drama

653
00:29:11,967 --> 00:29:12,967
get in the way of their health.

654
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,779
Will it kill Alfreeda to ask?
It's a kidney.

655
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,844
But why offer someone something

656
00:29:23,879 --> 00:29:25,312
and then make them ask for it?

657
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:26,914
Asking isn't such a big deal.

658
00:29:26,948 --> 00:29:28,916
So it makes perfect sense
that Alfreeda could die

659
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,317
while Verdene keeps her kidney hostage,

660
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:31,919
waiting for her to ask for it?

661
00:29:31,953 --> 00:29:33,788
It's about respect.
Verdene has sacrificed

662
00:29:33,822 --> 00:29:35,289
her own health, swooping in to help

663
00:29:35,323 --> 00:29:37,825
her entire family,
never getting a word of praise.

664
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,527
I'm sure no one ask her
to be their savior.

665
00:29:39,561 --> 00:29:40,828
She's doing it for the attention.

666
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,129
- That's not true.
- Of course it is.

667
00:29:42,164 --> 00:29:43,264
She's gotta be the bride at every wedding

668
00:29:43,298 --> 00:29:44,301
and the corpse at every funeral.

669
00:29:44,336 --> 00:29:46,434
Come on, show her some R-E-S-P-E-C-T.

670
00:29:46,468 --> 00:29:47,468
Respect.

671
00:29:47,502 --> 00:29:49,771
Respect is earned, not demanded.

672
00:30:17,666 --> 00:30:19,667
- Hi, Chante.
- Hi.

673
00:30:19,701 --> 00:30:23,337
So Chante, I brought
Dr. Bloom here with me,

674
00:30:23,371 --> 00:30:26,140
because I thought
you might feel more comfortable

675
00:30:26,174 --> 00:30:28,008
speaking with a female doctor.

676
00:30:28,043 --> 00:30:31,011
I also wanted to tell you that
we went around the hospital

677
00:30:31,046 --> 00:30:32,300
and we spoke to some lawyers here.

678
00:30:32,334 --> 00:30:35,382
And if you want to have
an abortion, then you can.

679
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:37,651
- Yeah.
- But Kaye said no.

680
00:30:37,686 --> 00:30:40,921
Yes, I know, but as your guardian,

681
00:30:40,956 --> 00:30:43,023
she is there to support you
whenever you can't

682
00:30:43,058 --> 00:30:44,225
make a decision on your own.

683
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,392
But in this case,

684
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:47,161
I think it's very clear that you can.

685
00:30:47,195 --> 00:30:48,429
And as you're only nine weeks,

686
00:30:48,463 --> 00:30:50,698
it is still legally your choice to make.

687
00:30:51,124 --> 00:30:53,960
I don't want Kaye mad at me.

688
00:30:55,737 --> 00:30:58,405
Chante, you know,
I had to make a choice too

689
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,050
when I was your age.

690
00:31:00,709 --> 00:31:05,045
Doing what was right for me,
it helped me make that choice.

691
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,916
Didn't make it any easier,
but it did make it clearer.

692
00:31:09,517 --> 00:31:11,218
Do you wanna have an abortion?

693
00:31:11,561 --> 00:31:13,120
Yeah.

694
00:31:13,154 --> 00:31:14,606
Okay.

695
00:31:18,326 --> 00:31:20,194
Now, look, since you're
under guardianship,

696
00:31:20,228 --> 00:31:22,296
we just need to ask you
a few more questions.

697
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:23,564
More questions?

698
00:31:23,598 --> 00:31:25,707
Just to make sure that you
have thought everything through.

699
00:31:25,742 --> 00:31:28,702
Like, after the abortion,
what's your plan?

700
00:31:28,737 --> 00:31:30,604
My plan?

701
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:34,241
Your relationship with Kaye, um...

702
00:31:34,276 --> 00:31:35,879
it may change.

703
00:31:43,184 --> 00:31:45,419
Like, if she's mad

704
00:31:45,453 --> 00:31:48,055
and doesn't want me
to live with her no more?

705
00:31:48,089 --> 00:31:52,593
Not living with Kaye is a possibility.

706
00:31:52,627 --> 00:31:54,261
Something that you have to think about.

707
00:31:54,296 --> 00:31:56,597
And I can't lose Kaye.

708
00:31:56,631 --> 00:31:58,608
I can't lose Kaye.

709
00:31:59,859 --> 00:32:01,635
Which is why we need a plan.

710
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,504
I don't need a plan.

711
00:32:04,114 --> 00:32:06,273
I don't need a plan.

712
00:32:06,308 --> 00:32:08,689
I need just Kaye.

713
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:19,753
Uh, excuse me, Detective,
where you taking her?

714
00:32:19,788 --> 00:32:21,789
The precinct. It's none of your concern.

715
00:32:21,823 --> 00:32:23,624
Uh, you're taking a patient
out of my hospital.

716
00:32:23,658 --> 00:32:25,759
I'm very concerned.
Kaye, what did you say?

717
00:32:25,794 --> 00:32:27,761
Nothing, just that she lost her way.

718
00:32:27,796 --> 00:32:29,630
So now we go to the precinct.

719
00:32:36,338 --> 00:32:38,639
- I'm attaching the aorta.
- You have 45 seconds.

720
00:32:38,673 --> 00:32:40,774
Still have to do the pulmonary vein.

721
00:32:40,809 --> 00:32:42,109
Duke, I need those hands.

722
00:32:42,143 --> 00:32:43,444
Target core temp is 37 Celsius.

723
00:32:43,478 --> 00:32:45,145
- Sir?
- That's the pulmonary vein.

724
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,314
Right there. Use your 6-0 Prolene stitch.

725
00:32:47,349 --> 00:32:48,649
Don't back wall the vein, stat.

726
00:32:48,683 --> 00:32:50,150
Give me a 6-0 Prolene on a stick tie.

727
00:32:50,185 --> 00:32:52,653
Idle breathing looks good.

728
00:32:54,089 --> 00:32:55,055
She's normalizing.

729
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:57,391
You have five seconds,
but they're flicking by.

730
00:32:59,527 --> 00:33:01,662
Vitals are stable.

731
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:03,364
Ah, the boot should be wider

732
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:04,565
Time.

733
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:05,692
- Time, Dr. Reynolds.
- I hear you.

734
00:33:05,726 --> 00:33:08,136
- Almost there.
- Full shocks, holding.

735
00:33:08,703 --> 00:33:11,038
- Detractor number two.
- Clamps.

736
00:33:11,873 --> 00:33:15,409
- Duke.
- Done.

737
00:33:15,443 --> 00:33:17,044
Charging.

738
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,579
Clear.

739
00:33:25,353 --> 00:33:27,906
- Got a heartbeat.
- I got a pulse.

740
00:33:32,394 --> 00:33:33,494
Dr. Reynolds.

741
00:33:36,197 --> 00:33:37,831
The brainwaves aren't picking up.

742
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:44,738
Brain's warming too slowly.

743
00:33:46,307 --> 00:33:48,442
Does that mean she has brain damage?

744
00:33:49,052 --> 00:33:51,378
We won't know until she wakes up.

745
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:56,748
A little help here.

746
00:33:56,773 --> 00:33:57,940
Get her to bay 24.

747
00:33:57,974 --> 00:33:59,074
What happened?

748
00:33:59,108 --> 00:34:00,776
We were driving away
and she just started seizing.

749
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:02,849
- Casey, do a finger stick.
- What's going on?

750
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,575
We need ten units of insulin.

751
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:07,378
Blood glucose at 550.

752
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,349
I need ten units of insulin, subq.

753
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,590
Is she okay?

754
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:21,359
Kaye's a brittle diabetic.

755
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:23,494
- Brittle?
- It's a form of diabetes.

756
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:26,564
It manifests with dramatic
spiking of blood sugar levels.

757
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:28,321
Could that have caused the accident?

758
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:35,205
Very well could have.

759
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:50,279
How are you feeling, Miss Verdene?

760
00:34:50,279 --> 00:34:52,581
Well, it ain't childbirth.

761
00:34:52,615 --> 00:34:54,449
How long till you know if I'm a match?

762
00:34:54,484 --> 00:34:56,418
Could be as soon as tomorrow.

763
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,589
You can say thank you now.

764
00:35:00,623 --> 00:35:02,000
I could.

765
00:35:05,161 --> 00:35:06,463
Fine.

766
00:35:07,463 --> 00:35:09,097
Thank you.

767
00:35:09,131 --> 00:35:11,009
Now, was that so hard?

768
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:16,638
Well done, Vijay.

769
00:35:16,672 --> 00:35:18,974
Acting out their ridiculous
feud in front of them.

770
00:35:19,008 --> 00:35:20,643
Who was acting?

771
00:35:21,477 --> 00:35:23,778
You weren't really upset, were you?

772
00:35:23,813 --> 00:35:25,747
Talk to my hand.

773
00:35:33,322 --> 00:35:35,557
Um, hi.

774
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:36,682
Hi.

775
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:39,060
I should learn to accept a blessing

776
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:40,629
when it's offered to me, right?

777
00:35:40,663 --> 00:35:44,266
And to be, you know, less of a jerk.

778
00:35:48,577 --> 00:35:50,478
Well, it's about time.

779
00:35:57,313 --> 00:36:00,081
Oh, and some other ideas
I've been noodling:

780
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,316
a diaper service.

781
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,484
Or what about a CSA?

782
00:36:02,518 --> 00:36:04,619
Or how would you feel about
your very own car service?

783
00:36:04,654 --> 00:36:08,490
It all sounds great. Surprise me.

784
00:36:08,942 --> 00:36:10,193
Okay.

785
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:14,162
Auntie Kaye!

786
00:36:14,196 --> 00:36:16,498
Chante.

787
00:36:17,667 --> 00:36:19,367
You're about to squeeze me in half.

788
00:36:19,402 --> 00:36:21,169
I don't wanna lose you.

789
00:36:21,203 --> 00:36:23,271
I'm not going anywhere.

790
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,073
- Don't go, don't go.
- I'm right here.

791
00:36:27,543 --> 00:36:30,145
The court is restoring Chante's right

792
00:36:30,179 --> 00:36:31,613
to make this medical choice.

793
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:35,784
And, um... she hasn't made
a decision yet,

794
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:37,786
because she's a little bit scared of how

795
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,321
it might affect your relationship.

796
00:36:39,355 --> 00:36:42,557
Auntie Kaye, will you still love me?

797
00:36:44,727 --> 00:36:46,354
Always.

798
00:36:47,196 --> 00:36:48,730
But you're blocking a blessing, Chante.

799
00:36:48,764 --> 00:36:51,066
No, I'm not. God's with me.

800
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,367
God is with you?

801
00:36:52,401 --> 00:36:54,703
I prayed no baby.

802
00:36:54,737 --> 00:36:56,705
God crashed the van here.

803
00:36:56,739 --> 00:36:59,808
The doctor said "no baby," see?

804
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:04,179
I crashed the van.

805
00:37:05,094 --> 00:37:08,296
It was me. God had nothing to do with it.

806
00:37:08,876 --> 00:37:10,485
God's in you.

807
00:37:13,623 --> 00:37:15,133
Is God in me?

808
00:37:16,759 --> 00:37:20,095
No. No, that's not...

809
00:37:24,767 --> 00:37:26,394
I don't know.

810
00:37:27,903 --> 00:37:29,537
I don't know.

811
00:37:31,607 --> 00:37:33,375
I hope so.

812
00:37:33,409 --> 00:37:35,410
Auntie Kaye.

813
00:37:37,813 --> 00:37:39,881
Auntie Kaye.

814
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,625
Still no change?

815
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:54,596
No.

816
00:37:55,798 --> 00:37:58,366
Tamala kind of reminds me of my mom too.

817
00:38:00,336 --> 00:38:04,606
It's just we, uh... we haven't
talked much lately.

818
00:38:05,266 --> 00:38:07,018
Family stuff.

819
00:38:09,178 --> 00:38:13,983
Well, if this was your mom,
what would she want right now?

820
00:38:16,485 --> 00:38:17,987
Couldn't hurt.

821
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:30,665

822
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:34,669

829
00:39:39,735 --> 00:39:41,195
Hey, Mama.

830
00:39:41,904 --> 00:39:43,571
No, no, no, nothing's wrong.

831
00:39:43,606 --> 00:39:44,907
I, uh...

832
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:47,842
I just called to tell you I love you.

833
00:39:55,718 --> 00:39:57,819
Could you enter this
in the database, please?

834
00:40:00,923 --> 00:40:02,924
Shall we wait for your husband?

835
00:40:02,958 --> 00:40:05,927
You know, he's not gonna make it,

836
00:40:05,961 --> 00:40:08,730
but we are both very excited
about moving forward

837
00:40:08,764 --> 00:40:10,265
with the adoption process.

838
00:40:10,299 --> 00:40:11,699
Okay, great. Come on in.

839
00:40:11,734 --> 00:40:13,668
Thanks.

840
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:15,503
Have a seat.

841
00:40:23,612 --> 00:40:25,513
ED's still empty.

842
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:28,583
How'd the changed woman enjoy her shift?

843
00:40:28,617 --> 00:40:32,687
You know, it was exactly what I needed.

844
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:45,700
Tidy Town Cleaners.

845
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:48,703
Are you... Dr. Goodwin?

846
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:50,438
Uh, yeah, but I didn't...

847
00:40:50,472 --> 00:40:51,873
The bill's covered, tip included.

848
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:53,541
A gift from your friend Helen.

849
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:55,510
- Right.
- May we come in?

850
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,065
Sure.

851
00:41:00,704 --> 00:41:02,450
Sor... you know what? Sorry.

852
00:41:02,484 --> 00:41:04,118
Actually, I'm good. I'm okay.

853
00:41:04,153 --> 00:41:05,370
I'm okay. Thank you.

854
00:41:05,405 --> 00:41:06,521
- Oh, but we've already...
- Thank you.

855
00:41:06,555 --> 00:41:07,922
- Yeah, sorry.
- But we've already...

856
00:41:07,957 --> 00:41:09,958
No, no, I appreciate it. Thank you.

857
00:41:15,998 --> 00:41:18,132
Hey.

858
00:41:18,167 --> 00:41:20,134
Hi. Hey.

859
00:41:20,169 --> 00:41:22,637
Come here. Okay.

860
00:41:22,671 --> 00:41:24,672
Hi. Oh, I got you.

861
00:41:24,707 --> 00:41:26,841
Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.
