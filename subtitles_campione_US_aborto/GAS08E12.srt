1
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:10,609
<i>"There's nothing else
we can do for you."</i>

2
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,945
<i>These are the last words a
surgeon wants to tell a patient.</i>

3
00:00:14,015 --> 00:00:16,693
Eight surgeons have
said this is inoperable.

4
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:19,918
I mean, even the tumor
board at Cleveland Clinic.

5
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:22,321
I can see why.

6
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:24,150
<i>Giving up doesn't
come easy to us,</i>

7
00:00:24,174 --> 00:00:26,442
<i>so we do everything
in our power not to.</i>

8
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,126
Catch.

9
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:31,141
What's this for? Heads,
we do it. Tails, we don't.

10
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:32,814
You're insane.

11
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,745
It's a gut check. I get a
feeling when it's in the air,

12
00:00:34,769 --> 00:00:36,395
what I want it to land on.

13
00:00:36,419 --> 00:00:37,669
Flip it.

14
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,560
<i>For surgeons, "lost cause"</i>

15
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,789
<i>just means "try
a little harder."</i>

16
00:00:48,766 --> 00:00:50,014
Oh, damn it. I screwed it up.

17
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,500
"Gag Zola," really?

18
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:53,825
Those aren't G's. Those
are Y's for "Yay." "Yay, Zola."

19
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,065
See, a normal person would've
just written, "Happy Birthday."

20
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:58,273
Well, I couldn't fit all
those letters on the cake.

21
00:00:58,342 --> 00:01:00,854
Okay, who used up the
last of my deodorant?

22
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:02,594
Oh, that might have been me.

23
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:04,563
Sorry, kinda had a
workout last night.

24
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,866
Not mine. ALEX: Coffee.

25
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:11,620
Fresh out, chief.

26
00:01:11,688 --> 00:01:13,616
Wait. No. That's impossible. I
just bought some three days ago.

27
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,856
You're out of OJ, too.

28
00:01:14,925 --> 00:01:16,424
Hey, you're still here?

29
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,621
Oh, yeah. I was on my way
out, and then I saw these cheeks.

30
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:19,878
So cute.

31
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:21,847
Oh! We don't touch the baby

32
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,676
because we don't know
where those hands have been.

33
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,250
Alex does.

34
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:27,597
Okay, so I have a meeting
with Owen, so I'm off.

35
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:28,932
Party is at 8:00. Don't be late.

36
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:31,089
I got 20 minutes before
work. You wanna, you know...

37
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:32,838
Yeah. Good. Come on.

38
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,227
Round two!

39
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:37,012
We need to move.

40
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:38,564
Do we?

41
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:41,400
Okay, take a look.

42
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:43,201
I took a little
more off this time.

43
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,869
No, I love it. Hey, look!

44
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:49,207
Ooh! I want that. Move.

45
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:52,594
I've got surgery in an hour,
so we'll do you tomorrow.

46
00:01:52,663 --> 00:01:55,964
And you, I will see
tonight at Zola's party.

47
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:57,260
Yes?

48
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:59,364
Love you. See ya.

49
00:02:02,306 --> 00:02:03,972
"See ya"?

50
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,835
Yeah. "I love you, too" is the
appropriate response to "I love you."

51
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,437
Yeah. Why wouldn't you...

52
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,389
We've been dating three
months. It's way too early for that.

53
00:02:09,413 --> 00:02:13,214
Oh, no! No, no, no!
This is classic Mark!

54
00:02:13,283 --> 00:02:14,728
He found out Lexie
and Jackson broke up,

55
00:02:14,752 --> 00:02:17,168
and now he's suddenly
getting cold feet about Julia.

56
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,087
You and Lexie are over, okay?

57
00:02:19,156 --> 00:02:21,322
That ship has sailed. And sank.

58
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,636
This has nothing
to do with Lexie.

59
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,256
Okay, I'm gonna take Sofia
to daycare. Come here, honey.

60
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,830
Hello! Yes, my little baby girl.

61
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:29,915
I love you.

62
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,451
Bye. I love you, too!

63
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:39,235
Morning, Dr. Webber. Morning.

64
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:41,540
Dr. Webber. How are you?

65
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:43,061
Dr. Bailey.

66
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:44,963
Congratulations, sir.

67
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:46,643
Big day today. Yes, it is!

68
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,067
But I don't want everybody
making a big deal out of it.

69
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,919
We won't. Good.

70
00:02:50,988 --> 00:02:52,516
I mean, you'll do something?

71
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,072
Yes.

72
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:57,592
I mean, it is my 10,000th
surgery, that's a lot of surgeries.

73
00:02:59,914 --> 00:03:01,947
I've reserved the
main conference room.

74
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,766
There will be a photographer
from the hospital newsletter.

75
00:03:04,834 --> 00:03:07,919
The cake is your favorite,
red velvet and cream cheese.

76
00:03:07,972 --> 00:03:10,755
It is huge, the size
of four cakes. Yes!

77
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:14,193
There will be several speeches
from admiring colleagues

78
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:16,828
and a toast with
sparkling cider.

79
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:18,897
We will also hang a banner

80
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:22,250
that says "Congratulations,
Dr. Webber, on your 10,000th surgery!"

81
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,604
There will be three exclamation
points after the word "surgery."

82
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:26,905
We also have confetti.

83
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,540
Happy now?

84
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,460
Yes.

85
00:03:32,529 --> 00:03:34,729
Oh, except for the confetti.

86
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:36,731
Might get in the cake.

87
00:03:43,173 --> 00:03:44,639
Oh, take a seat, Grey.

88
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:47,170
Okay, so I know I haven't
logged a lot of OR time lately,

89
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:48,939
but I've been getting a
routine down with Zola,

90
00:03:48,963 --> 00:03:51,758
and I've got it under
control now, so I'm all set.

91
00:03:51,782 --> 00:03:53,148
Is that it?

92
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,904
You still haven't
declared a specialty.

93
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,284
I know. It's a
really big decision,

94
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:03,692
and I have been
thinking about it.

95
00:04:03,761 --> 00:04:06,728
You ditched neuro,
you wasted time in OB,

96
00:04:06,797 --> 00:04:09,430
you're my only fifth year who
doesn't know where they're going.

97
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,561
You're drowning, Grey.
"Drowning" is a strong word.

98
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,017
How about general?

99
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,737
You've been helping
Bailey with the diabetes trial,

100
00:04:15,806 --> 00:04:18,557
and Webber's always been a
mentor, not to mention your mother.

101
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,265
She was one of the
best general surgeons

102
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:21,475
this country's ever seen.

103
00:04:21,545 --> 00:04:24,062
With that legacy,
you could be a natural.

104
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,767
How did you repair it that fast?

105
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:30,546
Well, it was luck more
than anything else.

106
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,148
He could've gone
into pulmonary edema.

107
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:35,273
No, it wasn't luck. You were
in the zone. That was amazing!

108
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:37,892
Oh. Dr. Altman!

109
00:04:38,796 --> 00:04:40,145
It's lasagna.

110
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:41,729
And this is a spinach pie.

111
00:04:41,798 --> 00:04:45,116
That's so sweet. Thank you.

112
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:47,425
It means a lot to me.

113
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:55,293
More widow casserole.

114
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:57,540
"Your husband's
dead. Have some food."

115
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:59,442
What is that? I'll
put it with the others.

116
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,502
Oh, hey. How'd the surgery go?

117
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:06,421
I'll see you in the pit.

118
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,319
Glad to see she's not
mad at me anymore.

119
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,110
She's very busy.

120
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:13,756
We just did a mitral valve
repair without bypass,

121
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,481
and she threw 25
stitches in 10 seconds.

122
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,860
I've never seen
anything like it.

123
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:19,094
How long's it been
since you slept?

124
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:20,686
I had a huge nap.

125
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:23,939
Whatever, I've done, like, eight
surgeries in the past 72 hours.

126
00:05:24,007 --> 00:05:27,525
Teddy's boundless grief is one of the
best things that's ever happened to me.

127
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,540
What is that? Is that trauma
or administrative crap?

128
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:32,459
No, none of your business.
Go home and get some sleep.

129
00:05:32,483 --> 00:05:34,794
Oh, trauma. Hey,
hey. No, Cristina...

130
00:05:34,818 --> 00:05:37,068
Take that. Hey!

131
00:05:38,521 --> 00:05:40,855
I was paged here. I
already ordered the CT.

132
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,257
He's my patient.

133
00:05:42,325 --> 00:05:43,636
This isn't finders, keepers.

134
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,605
I'm taking over the
patient. What do we got?

135
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:47,212
Back off, Yang. I
met the ambulance.

136
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,963
Everyone, take a
breath. What happened?

137
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:51,483
A 32-year-old ran his bike
into a wrought iron fence.

138
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,713
Yeah, and this is the fence
going directly into his heart.

139
00:05:53,737 --> 00:05:55,064
I know how to deal
with these injuries.

140
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,287
He's my patient.

141
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:57,701
I can remove it
thoracoscopically.

142
00:05:57,725 --> 00:05:59,252
Yeah, and that's
when the poor guy dies

143
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:01,320
because if you do that, you
won't have a direct visual.

144
00:06:01,344 --> 00:06:03,990
Plenty of people use the VATS
technique to remove impaled objects.

145
00:06:04,014 --> 00:06:05,297
Now you're the expert?

146
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,643
You don't get every
cardio case, Yang.

147
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:07,999
Enough, all of you.

148
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:10,835
McQueen is the doctor
on call, he can handle it.

149
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:11,987
Karev, you will assist.

150
00:06:12,055 --> 00:06:14,667
Altman, I believe that
today is your day off.

151
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:16,341
Go get some rest.

152
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:19,622
Dr. Altman has way
more experience,

153
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:21,191
and this is gonna be a
complicated procedure.

154
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:23,426
Well, both of you have been
up for the past 48 hours straight.

155
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:26,634
This is a liability issue.
Hands off the patient.

156
00:06:28,605 --> 00:06:30,304
Dr. Altman?

157
00:06:30,373 --> 00:06:32,173
Fine.

158
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:34,626
Enjoy your nap.

159
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,181
His neuroblastoma is more
complicated than most I've seen.

160
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:46,883
It's very rare that
someone his age...

161
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,357
They're mostly in
younger kids, I know.

162
00:06:49,425 --> 00:06:51,771
It's in a very large
region of his spine.

163
00:06:51,795 --> 00:06:53,756
There is the very
likely risk of paralysis.

164
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,925
From his upper body down.
There's also the risk of death,

165
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:58,094
a death that he is gonna
meet in three months anyway

166
00:06:58,118 --> 00:06:59,662
if you don't do this surgery.

167
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:01,597
I understand the
risks, Dr. Shepherd.

168
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:04,305
The surgeon in
Boston compared it to

169
00:07:04,374 --> 00:07:06,619
dismantling a bomb
with your eyes closed,

170
00:07:06,643 --> 00:07:10,462
and the one in Chicago said it
was patching a dam with gum.

171
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:12,798
You're the ninth
surgeon I've talked to.

172
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:16,334
So what I want to know is, are
you gonna say anything different,

173
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:18,802
or do I have to take
my kid somewhere else?

174
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,843
There is only a 5%
chance of success.

175
00:07:25,929 --> 00:07:27,229
Maybe a little less.

176
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,651
Yes, if you're
willing, I'll try.

177
00:07:38,641 --> 00:07:40,452
Okay. Should I go tell Wes?

178
00:07:40,476 --> 00:07:43,594
Wait. There's something else.

179
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:45,557
He doesn't know about his tumor.

180
00:07:45,581 --> 00:07:47,748
He's 11, a young 11,

181
00:07:47,817 --> 00:07:49,745
and knowing that he's
very likely gonna die

182
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:52,531
is not something that's
gonna do him any good.

183
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,675
Why does he think he's here?

184
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,175
A backache.

185
00:07:58,128 --> 00:07:59,911
A very bad backache.

186
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:16,939
Hey, Dr. Bailey.

187
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,175
Chief Hunt says I need
to declare a specialty.

188
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,531
He suggested general.

189
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,866
Good for you. Mini Ellis Grey!

190
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,629
No. I'm still on
the fence about it

191
00:08:23,653 --> 00:08:25,698
because there are a lot
of specialties out there...

192
00:08:25,722 --> 00:08:27,722
Don't be an idiot. It's
in your genes, Grey.

193
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:28,889
It makes perfect sense.

194
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:33,828
Oh, Karen and Marcy,

195
00:08:33,897 --> 00:08:36,514
I'd like you to meet
Dr. Bailey and Dr. Grey.

196
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:39,351
They'll be performing the
liver transplant with me today.

197
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,685
Nice to meet you.

198
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:43,221
This IV really hurts.

199
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,917
You think it could be infected?

200
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,726
I mean, I'm already missing
my family vacation for this.

201
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:49,293
I'd hate to die of staph.

202
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,764
You're not gonna die, Marcy.
I am the one in liver failure.

203
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,216
It doesn't look infected. A
little discomfort is normal.

204
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:57,085
Thank you! I'm
sorry. I'm just nervous.

205
00:08:57,154 --> 00:09:00,805
I've never had a
major surgery before.

206
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,958
But when your sister calls
you to come and save her life,

207
00:09:04,027 --> 00:09:07,323
I mean, you take that call. How
lucky I am to have just that sister.

208
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:08,630
Yes, you are.

209
00:09:08,698 --> 00:09:11,015
Well, the labs look good.
We're ready for transplant.

210
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,817
In the meantime,
why don't we relax?

211
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,453
Relax? In a hospital?

212
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:18,139
It'd be a lot easier on
a white, sandy beach.

213
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:21,175
I'm gonna reimburse
you for this trip. I promise.

214
00:09:21,244 --> 00:09:22,805
I just hope I
don't die in there.

215
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:24,996
I mean, it would be hard
to reimburse me for my life.

216
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:28,633
Thank you, Marcy. I just
can't thank you enough.

217
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:30,518
Oh, you're welcome.

218
00:09:32,022 --> 00:09:34,706
Fort Ticonderoga is
probably my favorite.

219
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:37,091
It's not giant like Gettysburg
or famous like the Alamo.

220
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,255
You feel any pain
here, Wes? A little.

221
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,257
Still, it was a
really important fort.

222
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:44,932
It changed hands a bunch
of times in just a few years.

223
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,679
Benedict Arnold
even fought there.

224
00:09:46,703 --> 00:09:48,330
He's got a thing
about battlefields.

225
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:50,905
I see that. Hey, relax.

226
00:09:50,974 --> 00:09:53,619
My mom says I got it from my
dad. He died when I was two.

227
00:09:53,643 --> 00:09:55,961
We've gone to 18
battlefields in the past year.

228
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:58,496
We homeschool
because of the back pain.

229
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:00,331
It's so cool.

230
00:10:00,384 --> 00:10:02,044
I wake up, and we get to
decide what I do that day.

231
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:04,402
Next week, we're
going to Pearl Harbor.

232
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:07,038
That way, my mom can
have a beach vacation, too.

233
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,640
Actually, Wes, we may
be postponing Hawaii.

234
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:12,510
Dr. Shepherd thinks he
might be able to fix your back.

235
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:14,390
Really? Then I won't
have these aches anymore?

236
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:17,865
Well, that's the plan.

237
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,191
What about ortho? Callie
would be a great mentor.

238
00:10:20,237 --> 00:10:21,413
Bones? Oncology.

239
00:10:21,437 --> 00:10:22,832
Depressing. Trauma.

240
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:24,367
I've had enough
trauma for one lifetime.

241
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:27,475
Well, just pick something.
This decision is important.

242
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:30,845
Check it. Fence guy,
heart's the size of a football.

243
00:10:30,914 --> 00:10:32,991
From hitting a fence? From
being impaled on a fence.

244
00:10:33,015 --> 00:10:35,750
Don't worry, Yang. I'll send
you pics from the surgery.

245
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,415
Hey, is it too late
for me to pick cardio?

246
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:40,805
Yes. Cardio's mine.

247
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,080
You don't have to do
this, you know? I want to.

248
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,583
He's the Chief of Surgery. And
that heart is the size of a football.

249
00:10:55,806 --> 00:10:57,254
He's leaving.

250
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:01,109
Okay, go.

251
00:11:01,177 --> 00:11:02,243
Go now.

252
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,578
Mrs. Vanderburg, I'm Dr. Yang.

253
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:12,954
I'm so sorry to hear about
your husband's accident.

254
00:11:13,022 --> 00:11:14,421
Are you one of his doctors?

255
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,908
I'm not, but I'm
familiar with his case,

256
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,604
and I just wanted to assure you

257
00:11:18,628 --> 00:11:22,047
that everyone here is doing
everything they can for him.

258
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:23,581
That's so nice.

259
00:11:23,633 --> 00:11:27,084
I'm sure they've assembled a
wonderful group of surgeons.

260
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,970
Dr. Altman really
is the best there is.

261
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,822
Wait. No.

262
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:33,858
I don't think they
mentioned an Altman.

263
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:36,061
No, they said something
about a Dr. McQueen.

264
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:38,580
Is that right? Is he good, too?

265
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:41,532
Dr. McQueen?

266
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,735
Oh, sure. He's fine.

267
00:11:45,888 --> 00:11:47,155
Fine?

268
00:11:47,223 --> 00:11:49,790
Well, he's an
experienced surgeon,

269
00:11:49,859 --> 00:11:52,188
but he's not the head
of the department.

270
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:55,046
Dr. Altman is the
head of the department.

271
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:56,241
You know, I...

272
00:11:56,265 --> 00:11:58,094
With the extent of
your husband's injuries,

273
00:11:58,118 --> 00:12:01,319
I just... Look, I just assumed
she was on the case.

274
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,272
But

275
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,175
I'm sure there's
nothing to worry about.

276
00:12:07,243 --> 00:12:09,477
Dr. Altman probably
wasn't available anyway.

277
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,763
She's very busy these days...

278
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,815
Saving lives.

279
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,919
You swam with the dolphins?

280
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,755
Kaylee swam with the dolphins.

281
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:26,210
Okay, honey, Mommy needs
to go save Aunt Karen's life now.

282
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,948
Bye-bye, sweetie.
I love you, too.

283
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,435
I am risking my life here.

284
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,437
It's not like a
ride to the airport.

285
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,518
Believe me, after this,
I will never ask you

286
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:42,126
for a ride to the airport. I will
never ask you for anything again.

287
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:43,511
What is that supposed to mean?

288
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,940
Just need a little blood here.

289
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,975
Because I am never
gonna hear the end of it.

290
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:49,946
You're gonna lord this
stupid piece of liver over me

291
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,231
until we're both dead,
just like everything else.

292
00:12:52,255 --> 00:12:53,932
One more tube, and
I'll be out of your hair.

293
00:12:53,956 --> 00:12:57,541
Everything else? Like
all the checks I sent?

294
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,993
Or the jobs I lined up?

295
00:12:59,062 --> 00:13:01,729
You managed to get yourself
fired from most of those.

296
00:13:01,797 --> 00:13:04,315
And I have never asked
you for anything in return.

297
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,234
Oh no, just my lips
glued to your ass 24/7.

298
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,931
You know what?
Keep your damn liver.

299
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,855
Oh, here we go.

300
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:13,985
You know, I have no job, no
husband, no kids. You won, okay?

301
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:16,244
So just, hey, forget
the transplant.

302
00:13:16,312 --> 00:13:18,472
Just... You're off the
hook. You're off the hook.

303
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:21,882
Catch your plane to Maui, swim
with your precious dolphins...

304
00:13:21,951 --> 00:13:23,629
Karen, what hurts? Don't worry.

305
00:13:23,653 --> 00:13:25,803
When I'm winning the
fight, she doesn't feel good.

306
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:27,238
I'm in liver failure.

307
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,773
Classic drama queen.

308
00:13:31,695 --> 00:13:34,012
I need some FFP
and octreotide in here!

309
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:40,196
There's bleeding in the veins

310
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,464
at the bottom of your esophagus.

311
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,554
That's a symptom of
late-stage liver failure.

312
00:13:43,607 --> 00:13:45,339
You have surgery
in a couple of hours.

313
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:48,242
You have to try not to get
worked up between now and then.

314
00:13:48,311 --> 00:13:51,796
I told Dr. Grey, I'm
not having the surgery.

315
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:53,709
I want to go back
on the transplant list.

316
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:55,127
There's no time for that, Karen.

317
00:13:55,151 --> 00:13:57,502
When these symptoms
start, we can't wait any longer.

318
00:13:57,571 --> 00:14:00,437
Karen, you're going
to die. Don't be stupid.

319
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,866
Okay, enough from you.

320
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:04,509
Fine.

321
00:14:04,578 --> 00:14:05,771
I'll take her liver.

322
00:14:05,795 --> 00:14:07,128
Thank God.

323
00:14:07,197 --> 00:14:09,763
Honestly, the things you
put our family through.

324
00:14:09,832 --> 00:14:13,400
I'll call Harry and the kids. They'll
be so thrilled you've chosen life.

325
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:16,637
You got it? Yeah.

326
00:14:22,978 --> 00:14:24,495
Here you go.

327
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,332
Did the tumor grow more?

328
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,722
What did you say?

329
00:14:35,391 --> 00:14:37,558
I know what I have.

330
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:40,511
I overheard some doctors
talking about it at the last hospital.

331
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,191
Does your mom
know that you know?

332
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,015
No. She'd just freak out.

333
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:47,435
She's your mom.
She needs to know.

334
00:14:47,503 --> 00:14:51,388
She cries in the bathroom.
She cries at night.

335
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:53,857
She cries in the morning when
she thinks I'm not awake yet.

336
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:57,261
She cries all the time.

337
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,998
And the only thing that makes her
happy is to think that I don't know.

338
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,217
You can't tell her.

339
00:15:03,286 --> 00:15:06,104
If I'm happy, she's happy.

340
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:11,609
I promise. I won't tell.

341
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:12,911
You're not lying?

342
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:14,145
I'm not lying.

343
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,184
Do you think I'm gonna die?

344
00:15:27,944 --> 00:15:31,029
I've worked with
Dr. Shepherd for a while now.

345
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:34,176
And your mom could not have
picked a better doctor for you.

346
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,683
He's the best.

347
00:15:37,887 --> 00:15:39,664
Well, this one has a
patio and a garage,

348
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,490
but this one has hardwood
floors and a washer/dryer.

349
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:44,570
You sure you want to move?
Meredith and Derek have a baby,

350
00:15:44,594 --> 00:15:46,339
and you're living with
your ex. We're moving.

351
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:48,312
I'll move. Zola's
killing my game.

352
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:50,559
Every girl I bring home wants
a baby the minute they see her.

353
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,783
No! I'm not living with you.

354
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:53,963
I am trying to get
away from you.

355
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:55,097
All right, then you and me.

356
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,382
You don't want to
live with Mary Poppins.

357
00:15:56,406 --> 00:15:59,001
No, she cooks, she
cleans... I'm also your friend.

358
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:00,937
What the hell? I need
food for Zola's party.

359
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:02,805
I thought I was gonna
have time to go to the store,

360
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:05,296
but Richard's 10,000th
surgery is gonna take forever.

361
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:08,165
You think Teddy's gonna care if I
take some of her widow casseroles?

362
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:10,313
No. Go for it. You know
what? Take this one, too.

363
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:12,481
It's turkey
tetrazzini. Ooh, yum!

364
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:14,199
You and McQueen
finally find a patient

365
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,267
who's willing to let
you operate on them?

366
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:16,474
Bite my ass.

367
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:18,226
Oh, Mer, proctology.

368
00:16:18,294 --> 00:16:20,656
There's your specialty.
Explore the mysteries of the butt.

369
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,141
Why aren't you just doing
general like your mom?

370
00:16:22,165 --> 00:16:23,692
It's a no-brainer.
And good marketing.

371
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:24,893
When people hear the name Grey,

372
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,628
they know they're
getting quality.

373
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,297
No, you can't win following
in the footsteps of a phenom.

374
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,401
Said the lame, mediocre
grandson of Harper Avery.

375
00:16:35,544 --> 00:16:37,489
Hello, Julia. What is this?

376
00:16:37,513 --> 00:16:39,714
She's you. You're
Julia. Go with it.

377
00:16:39,783 --> 00:16:43,150
You know, I've been thinking,
it's been a really great few months,

378
00:16:43,236 --> 00:16:44,963
and I just want you
to know that I love you.

379
00:16:44,987 --> 00:16:46,254
Get out of my relationship.

380
00:16:46,322 --> 00:16:48,539
Funny, coming from you.

381
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:51,187
What's your problem? She's
smart and pretty and funny and...

382
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:52,460
And she's not annoying.

383
00:16:52,528 --> 00:16:54,356
Come on, it's awesome.
We can all vacation together.

384
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,891
We can buy houses
next door to each other.

385
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:57,393
Yeah, and Sofia can
have a village. Yes.

386
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:59,077
Don't you want your
daughter to have a village?

387
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,846
Come on. You know you love
her. Now you just need to tell her.

388
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,197
Who do you love, Julia? Hey.

389
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,732
Hey. Wait. You're
here? I love your hair.

390
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:06,157
How are you? Yeah,
I'm good. Thanks.

391
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:07,870
So what's going on with Julia?

392
00:17:09,646 --> 00:17:11,540
Did he just leave because of me?

393
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:13,009
Oh, no. No, he's
just being Mark.

394
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:15,393
No, no, no. 'Cause you're
great. You know, weird.

395
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,775
All right, sir, are you smiling?

396
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:27,695
I'm wearing a mask.
I'm not sure it matters.

397
00:17:27,764 --> 00:17:29,614
Oh, yeah. You can
see a smile in the eyes.

398
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:32,082
For the love of God,
take the damn picture.

399
00:17:33,035 --> 00:17:34,955
Ten thousand! Incredible!

400
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:38,984
Nice work! All right. Okay.

401
00:17:39,008 --> 00:17:40,936
All right, now get out.
Get on with your day.

402
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,604
Nice job, Dr. Webber.

403
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:43,828
Kepner, take a look.

404
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:48,215
It's... Sir, it says you're
needed in the lobby.

405
00:17:48,284 --> 00:17:51,430
Can you tell 'em that I'm in the
middle of my 10,000th surgery?

406
00:17:51,454 --> 00:17:53,199
Oh, are you sure we
shouldn't just send an intern...

407
00:17:53,223 --> 00:17:54,983
Handle it, Kepner. Got it.

408
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,747
And that's great,
thanks. Thank you.

409
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:04,815
Cristina, what are
you still doing here?

410
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:07,919
I'm gonna watch a
surgery. Derek's tumor thing.

411
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:09,849
You need sleep. Yeah,
I'm watching neurosurgery.

412
00:18:09,873 --> 00:18:11,422
It's a lot like sleeping.

413
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:13,891
You're not mad that I
gave the case to McQueen?

414
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:16,354
I didn't say that.

415
00:18:16,379 --> 00:18:17,478
And Teddy, she...

416
00:18:17,547 --> 00:18:18,791
Owen. I know.

417
00:18:18,815 --> 00:18:20,931
I know. You don't
want to talk about it.

418
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,901
What do I do? How do
I get past this with her?

419
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,370
Her husband's dead.
She's taking it out on you.

420
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,816
You just gotta
deal with it. I know.

421
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,506
I know, but I just wish that...

422
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:33,444
You know what? Never mind.

423
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:36,730
I'm talking to you when I
should just try to talk to her.

424
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,031
Mmm-hmm.

425
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:41,952
Well, see you at the party?

426
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:44,221
Yeah. Okay.

427
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:52,190
Somebody paged Dr. Webber.
He's in the middle of a transplant.

428
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,814
Yes, over there.

429
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:58,018
Mrs. Webber?

430
00:18:58,087 --> 00:19:01,555
Where is my husband?
Do you know where he is?

431
00:19:01,624 --> 00:19:03,908
I found her on the street.
She was trying to walk here.

432
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:07,155
I live next door to the
Webbers. It's seven miles away.

433
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:08,757
Oh, God. Where is he?

434
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:10,526
I want you to go
find him right now!

435
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,144
Yeah, I will go
find your husband.

436
00:19:12,168 --> 00:19:15,085
Would you just stand here,
just for one moment, please?

437
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,285
Could you just stay with her
until I can talk to Dr. Webber

438
00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:20,658
and figure out what to do?

439
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,686
I can try. She's
pretty insistent.

440
00:19:22,712 --> 00:19:26,163
Okay. Well, I have an office on
the third floor, if you could just...

441
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:28,866
What? Wait, wait. Mrs. Webber?

442
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:34,104
Oh, no! No, no, no!

443
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:46,400
Mrs. Webber, there you are.

444
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,321
I don't understand.

445
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,506
What's going on? Where
are Richard's things?

446
00:19:52,574 --> 00:19:55,076
Yeah, I know this must
be very confusing...

447
00:19:55,144 --> 00:19:57,311
This used to be Richard's
office, but now he's...

448
00:19:57,379 --> 00:19:59,379
He's gone? He left me?

449
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:02,683
No! No, no, no. He's just...
He's in surgery right now.

450
00:20:02,752 --> 00:20:04,769
It's his 10,000th surgery.

451
00:20:04,821 --> 00:20:08,022
He always wanted
to leave me for her.

452
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:10,357
He finally did. No.

453
00:20:10,426 --> 00:20:12,559
He never loved me. Never!

454
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,546
Oh, God. It was always her.

455
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:18,099
And now he's gone?

456
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:20,579
And he just left? He
didn't even tell me where...

457
00:20:20,603 --> 00:20:22,670
He's just gone. No.
Okay, Mrs. Webber...

458
00:20:22,738 --> 00:20:24,316
Richard. I need you
to please try and...

459
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,539
Just try and calm down...

460
00:20:25,608 --> 00:20:26,848
I can't do it alone.

461
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:29,026
I can't. I can't do it alone.

462
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:31,278
Please, Richard, don't leave me.

463
00:20:31,347 --> 00:20:35,449
Richard, I can't do it
alone. I can't. It's all right.

464
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,270
Transect the parenchyma.

465
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:42,273
Watch the aspirator,
Grey. Got it.

466
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:44,492
Nice. Nice technique.

467
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,738
Well, you've certainly
got your mother's hands.

468
00:20:46,762 --> 00:20:49,380
Don't get too excited. I
haven't declared anything yet.

469
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:52,850
Well, what else are you
gonna do, neuro, cardio?

470
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,719
You want to waste
your talent playing with

471
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:59,790
one little predictable organ
for the rest of your life?

472
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:02,910
I'd rather spend my
days leaping from the liver

473
00:21:02,978 --> 00:21:06,029
to the pancreas to the
stomach to the bowels,

474
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:09,833
and anyone could
go wrong at any time.

475
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:12,736
Okay, sure there's nothing
wrong with knowing one organ

476
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:14,271
and knowing it well,

477
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,619
just like there's nothing
wrong with being fifth-chair viola

478
00:21:16,643 --> 00:21:18,520
in the back of the orchestra.

479
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:21,944
But it's a hell of a lot more
fun being the conductor.

480
00:21:22,898 --> 00:21:24,164
Now...

481
00:21:24,233 --> 00:21:27,184
This goes to the chief.

482
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:36,171
Are they ready? Yeah.

483
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:38,128
But I can give you a few
more minutes, though.

484
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:39,747
No, we're ready.

485
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,500
Wes, time to put
the computer away.

486
00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:52,442
You are gonna be okay.

487
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:55,546
And the doctors are gonna
take really good care of you.

488
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:56,814
Mom, don't cry.

489
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:01,080
You know me, I cry when
you leave for a sleepover.

490
00:22:01,104 --> 00:22:02,536
Well, don't.

491
00:22:02,605 --> 00:22:04,505
Dr. Shepherd's the best.

492
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,676
You're right, as usual.

493
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,470
Give me a hug.

494
00:22:23,993 --> 00:22:25,859
Oh, you're still here.

495
00:22:28,498 --> 00:22:30,326
Listen, I know you
don't want to talk to me,

496
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,094
but this has gone on too long.

497
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:34,335
Now, I understand why. At least,

498
00:22:35,571 --> 00:22:36,654
I want to.

499
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:40,341
We need to talk.
Can we just talk?

500
00:22:40,409 --> 00:22:41,649
Now is not a good time.

501
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:43,670
Teddy. Don't!

502
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:53,009
It's wrapped around more of
the vessels than the scan showed.

503
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:58,075
What do you think, Dr. Grey?
We should start with the T4?

504
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:02,513
Yeah, I still think that's
the best approach.

505
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:04,515
There's no clear
prevertebral plane.

506
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:07,162
All right, well, take me
through it, step-by-step.

507
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:09,720
Okay, we get up
above T3, maybe T2,

508
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:12,790
we get control of
the aorta proximally,

509
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:14,825
and then dissect
the large vessels free.

510
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:17,511
We preserve the radicular
branches as we go,

511
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,879
especially Adamkiewicz...

512
00:23:18,948 --> 00:23:21,281
He's paralyzed if we go
anywhere near the Adamkiewicz.

513
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:24,218
If we don't get this tumor,
this surgery is for nothing.

514
00:23:25,021 --> 00:23:26,787
Right.

515
00:23:26,856 --> 00:23:29,890
So, we go in for
lateral instead?

516
00:23:31,393 --> 00:23:32,754
Are you asking me or telling me?

517
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:34,344
I'm telling.

518
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,914
I mean, we could
mobilize the great vessels,

519
00:23:36,983 --> 00:23:40,401
and that way we get access
to the tumor on both sides.

520
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:44,572
Can I get some suction in here?

521
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,359
I have attached the hepatic veins.
Now I'm reconstructing the portal vein.

522
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:51,796
He left me. He left me. I
don't want to see him working.

523
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:53,409
No... He's always working.

524
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:55,782
No, no, he didn't leave
you. He's right there. See?

525
00:23:57,586 --> 00:23:59,953
Oh, he's with that woman?

526
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:03,773
You tell that woman to go away.
That's my husband, not hers.

527
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:05,108
Richard!

528
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:07,277
<i>Dr. Webber.</i>

529
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:10,213
<i>Richard, why are you
doing this to me, to us?</i>

530
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:12,232
Adele? <i>You lied.</i>

531
00:24:12,301 --> 00:24:15,252
You said that you weren't
working with her anymore.

532
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:17,721
Dr. Webber, I'm sorry. I
didn't know what to do.

533
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:21,008
Ellis! You let him go.

534
00:24:21,077 --> 00:24:22,976
<i>Dr. Webber, do you want me to...</i>

535
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:25,262
<i>No, no, keep the line open.</i>

536
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,563
<i>Adele...</i>

537
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:28,715
<i>That's not Ellis, Adele.</i>

538
00:24:28,784 --> 00:24:31,434
What kind of woman would
break up a marriage, huh?

539
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:34,654
Ellis Grey, what kind
of woman are you?

540
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,883
I'm sorry. Well, I
should just scrub out.

541
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:38,536
No, no, I need the extra hands.

542
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,505
<i>I will not have you down
there with my husband.</i>

543
00:24:40,529 --> 00:24:42,596
<i>Do you hear me?
I will not have it.</i>

544
00:24:42,665 --> 00:24:45,232
<i>Richard, you just send her away.</i>

545
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:48,085
Adele, I'm right here.

546
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:49,770
I'm not leaving you.

547
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:51,500
Tell her something
that'll ground her.

548
00:24:51,524 --> 00:24:53,373
A happy memory. <i>Richard!</i>

549
00:24:53,442 --> 00:24:55,408
A happy memory, it
worked for my mom.

550
00:24:56,128 --> 00:24:57,678
Richard.

551
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:58,979
<i>Richard.</i>

552
00:24:59,982 --> 00:25:01,214
<i>Richard.</i>

553
00:25:05,854 --> 00:25:08,255
Richard, you need
to come out of there.

554
00:25:19,168 --> 00:25:20,183
Richard.

555
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:36,860
It's our wedding day.

556
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:40,369
You were the most
beautiful bride I've ever seen.

557
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,832
Oh, Richard.

558
00:26:41,901 --> 00:26:43,834
<i>And for our first dance,</i>

559
00:26:43,903 --> 00:26:47,070
they played <i>My Funny Valentine.</i>

560
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:49,856
Because we were getting
married on Valentine's Day.

561
00:26:53,045 --> 00:26:54,395
Happy Valentine's Day, baby.

562
00:26:57,383 --> 00:26:58,832
I love you.

563
00:27:01,137 --> 00:27:02,736
I love you, too.

564
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,944
Tell Bailey to cancel the party.

565
00:27:26,195 --> 00:27:27,672
So, once the
vertebrectomies are complete,

566
00:27:27,696 --> 00:27:30,313
we take the tumor down off
the dura, do a myelotomy...

567
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:31,642
And, again, hit the Adamkiewicz.

568
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:32,928
Paralyzed, dead in three months.

569
00:27:32,952 --> 00:27:34,145
We resect it free
from the aorta...

570
00:27:34,169 --> 00:27:35,736
Spinal shock. Dead.

571
00:27:35,804 --> 00:27:38,316
Harvest a radicular branch that
doesn't have tumor involvement.

572
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,456
Dead, again.

573
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:40,602
Okay, stop saying that.

574
00:27:40,626 --> 00:27:42,126
Dr. Grey.

575
00:27:42,194 --> 00:27:45,312
No, we told him that we
would try. You're not even trying.

576
00:27:46,348 --> 00:27:47,893
Because the
surgery will kill him.

577
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:50,145
We have no choice.
We have to close him up.

578
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:51,601
No.

579
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,582
Dr. Grey, I think it's time
you just... No, you're quitting.

580
00:27:53,606 --> 00:27:56,423
Okay, it's, it's not right, not
when we said that we would try.

581
00:27:56,492 --> 00:27:57,925
There's a 5% chance.

582
00:27:57,993 --> 00:28:00,393
We owe him... There is
no longer a 5% chance.

583
00:28:01,831 --> 00:28:03,430
Gelfoam, please.

584
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:05,065
No.

585
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:07,234
He knows about the tumor.

586
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,603
He has known all along.

587
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:15,041
I told him that we would try. I
told him that you were the best.

588
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,511
Now please, Derek, just...

589
00:28:17,579 --> 00:28:18,812
Please.

590
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,847
Leave the OR right now.

591
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:30,507
All right, let's close him up.

592
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:41,147
No party? Cancelled.
Help yourself to cakes.

593
00:28:43,071 --> 00:28:45,139
Karev, why aren't you
still in McQueen's surgery?

594
00:28:45,207 --> 00:28:47,157
Oh, Altman and Yang took that.

595
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:49,026
What?

596
00:28:53,349 --> 00:28:55,031
I could be wrong.

597
00:29:01,723 --> 00:29:03,106
You have to tell him.

598
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:04,318
But I thought he already knew.

599
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:05,419
No, about the tumor.

600
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:07,088
Not that we didn't
do the surgery.

601
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:09,156
His mom's not gonna tell him.

602
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,647
And he's gonna wake up,

603
00:29:10,716 --> 00:29:12,644
and she's gonna tell
him that it all went great,

604
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:14,779
and he's gonna go home
thinking that we did the surgery,

605
00:29:14,803 --> 00:29:17,243
not that he's gonna
die in three months.

606
00:29:17,272 --> 00:29:19,139
You need to tell him.

607
00:29:19,208 --> 00:29:21,825
She's the parent.
It is not our call.

608
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:24,027
I'm sorry, no.

609
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:27,080
We can't tell him anything.

610
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:38,458
That looks more
like a heart. Right?

611
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:51,471
What are you doing?
McQueen wasn't qualified.

612
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,989
I think I was clear in the ER.

613
00:29:53,058 --> 00:29:55,053
Yeah, I'm head of the
department. I made the call.

614
00:29:55,077 --> 00:29:56,854
Put another pledgeted
suture right here.

615
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,456
Right here between these two?

616
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,380
Yeah, but closer to the atrium.

617
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:03,033
You should've informed
me. There wasn't time.

618
00:30:03,102 --> 00:30:05,497
Dr. Yang stopped and
had a nice little chat with me

619
00:30:05,521 --> 00:30:08,121
a couple of hours ago on
her way to what I believe

620
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:10,540
is this procedure. And
then I spoke to you...

621
00:30:10,593 --> 00:30:12,904
Well, we didn't know that we
were doing the surgery then.

622
00:30:12,928 --> 00:30:14,845
I think you're lying
to me. Both of you...

623
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:17,275
You know what? This is a
fairly complicated procedure.

624
00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:19,232
Can we get into this later?

625
00:30:19,301 --> 00:30:21,062
Shall we do an
intraoperative echo?

626
00:30:21,086 --> 00:30:22,919
Yes. Why don't you pull it over?

627
00:30:22,971 --> 00:30:24,737
Find me when you're
finished, Doctor.

628
00:30:24,806 --> 00:30:26,089
Mmm-hmm.

629
00:30:29,444 --> 00:30:31,804
Did you see that throbbing vein?

630
00:30:32,064 --> 00:30:33,463
In his forehead?

631
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:36,077
I have the hardest time keeping
a straight face when it pops up.

632
00:30:40,406 --> 00:30:42,972
The surgery wasn't as
hard as they first thought,

633
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:45,642
which is good.

634
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:50,513
'Cause that means we
can make it to Hawaii now.

635
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:54,517
You're done. No more
surgeries or doctors.

636
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:57,520
That's it. It's just us.

637
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:59,400
And we're gonna go on
another trip after that, too.

638
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:03,143
Maybe even Normandy, like
we said. Doesn't that sound fun?

639
00:31:08,817 --> 00:31:10,450
You didn't do it.

640
00:31:11,553 --> 00:31:13,586
What?

641
00:31:13,655 --> 00:31:17,490
You said, after the surgery, I'd
be stuck in here for a few weeks.

642
00:31:18,927 --> 00:31:21,611
That's right. I did.

643
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:25,198
You know, sometimes when
we get in there, things change.

644
00:31:26,034 --> 00:31:27,451
That's why you get to go home.

645
00:31:30,489 --> 00:31:32,472
Which is a good thing, honey.

646
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:36,209
It's all gonna be fine.

647
00:31:36,278 --> 00:31:40,029
You're gonna be okay.
Mommy's gonna make sure of it.

648
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:42,799
And you don't have
to worry. I promise.

649
00:31:45,337 --> 00:31:47,337
You're gonna be okay, too.

650
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,660
You don't have
to worry about me.

651
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,110
I'm gonna be with Dad in heaven.

652
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:25,275
How'd it go? Great.

653
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:28,195
You are the proud new
owner of a fully functioning liver.

654
00:32:29,631 --> 00:32:30,931
Thank God.

655
00:32:30,999 --> 00:32:33,717
Don't thank God. Thank me.

656
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,169
I'll never be able to
wear a two-piece again.

657
00:32:36,237 --> 00:32:37,703
It's a horrible scar.

658
00:32:37,772 --> 00:32:41,607
I have thanked you,
Marcy, about a million times.

659
00:32:41,676 --> 00:32:43,577
Okay, enough. We're
not gonna do this again.

660
00:32:43,645 --> 00:32:46,530
But it doesn't seem
to make a difference.

661
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:48,581
You just don't get it.

662
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:49,816
So I'm done.

663
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:52,619
Excuse me? I am
done thanking you.

664
00:32:52,688 --> 00:32:56,906
You are not allowed to mention
your extraordinary generosity anymore,

665
00:32:56,976 --> 00:32:58,737
except once a year
on Thanksgiving.

666
00:32:58,761 --> 00:33:00,255
Okay, you're
gonna hurt yourself.

667
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:02,345
And on that night,
I will thank you.

668
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:04,492
But if you don't
follow my rules...

669
00:33:04,516 --> 00:33:07,183
Oh, there are rules? Yes.

670
00:33:07,252 --> 00:33:09,786
I will have to bring up
everything about you

671
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:12,171
that I have happily
chosen to not mention,

672
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,452
like how you've lost
thousands of dollars

673
00:33:14,476 --> 00:33:16,726
in that lipstick-selling
Ponzi scheme.

674
00:33:16,779 --> 00:33:18,528
That's none of your business.

675
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:20,757
And how sometimes,
when you're drunk and sad,

676
00:33:20,782 --> 00:33:22,532
you sext your college boyfriend.

677
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,211
You wouldn't? Yes, I would.

678
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:27,386
Which is why you will not
mention my liver ever again.

679
00:33:27,456 --> 00:33:29,388
My liver is dead to you!

680
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:32,058
Fine. Your liver's dead to me.

681
00:33:33,796 --> 00:33:35,089
What about the money you owe me?

682
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:37,297
Enough! Enough!
Both of you, stop talking.

683
00:33:37,383 --> 00:33:39,343
She is... No, I mean it.

684
00:33:39,385 --> 00:33:41,718
You are in a time
out, especially you.

685
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:43,303
No more talking.

686
00:33:43,371 --> 00:33:45,531
You can't talk to me like this.

687
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:47,291
This is...

688
00:33:56,518 --> 00:33:57,984
He's still in serious condition,

689
00:33:58,052 --> 00:34:00,170
so I'll be staying the
night to monitor him.

690
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:02,839
Actually, I'll stay
with him tonight.

691
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:04,791
Really?

692
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,070
The head of the department?

693
00:34:06,094 --> 00:34:07,677
I'm happy to do it.

694
00:34:07,746 --> 00:34:09,262
Oh. Thank you.

695
00:34:13,285 --> 00:34:15,018
I can stay with you.

696
00:34:15,087 --> 00:34:17,831
Your Zola's godmother. You
have to go to her birthday party.

697
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:20,885
Besides, I'm just gonna stay
here and eat widow casserole,

698
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:22,175
feel sorry for myself.

699
00:34:26,348 --> 00:34:27,580
Go. Out!

700
00:34:29,084 --> 00:34:30,183
Okay.

701
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:44,080
Happy birthday!

702
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:48,451
Hey, girl.

703
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:49,697
Look who didn't
just wake up, huh?

704
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:50,787
Look at you.

705
00:34:50,856 --> 00:34:53,840
You look so beautiful.
Look at that bow.

706
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:55,258
Got you.

707
00:34:58,229 --> 00:34:59,729
You made it.

708
00:34:59,798 --> 00:35:01,665
Of course.

709
00:35:01,733 --> 00:35:04,334
Adele insisted I didn't
miss little Miss Zola's party.

710
00:35:04,386 --> 00:35:06,319
So she's feeling
better then? Much.

711
00:35:06,388 --> 00:35:09,472
The night nurse is with her. She
was already asleep when I left.

712
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:11,758
And this is for
the guest of honor.

713
00:35:11,826 --> 00:35:13,426
How are you doing,
little Miss Zola?

714
00:35:13,495 --> 00:35:15,378
You look very pretty
for your birthday.

715
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:16,879
Yes, you do.

716
00:35:20,135 --> 00:35:21,284
I need 800 bucks.

717
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:22,663
Told you, if you're dumb enough

718
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:23,965
to buy groceries,
I'm gonna eat 'em.

719
00:35:23,989 --> 00:35:26,123
No, not for groceries.
For a security deposit.

720
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:27,668
We'll lose out on a
really great three-bedroom

721
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:29,320
if we don't get it to
the landlord today.

722
00:35:29,344 --> 00:35:31,255
Now you want to
live with me? No!

723
00:35:31,279 --> 00:35:33,579
You're gross, and a
pig, and a skank magnet,

724
00:35:33,648 --> 00:35:35,526
and you leave your dirty
boy socks everywhere.

725
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,262
Keep going this way, and
you'll wind up old and alone,

726
00:35:38,286 --> 00:35:41,131
wandering the streets with
some ancient form of syphilis.

727
00:35:41,155 --> 00:35:43,523
All right, I think what
she's trying to say is, yes.

728
00:35:43,592 --> 00:35:45,892
She would be happy if
you'd be our roommate.

729
00:35:45,961 --> 00:35:46,977
Cool.

730
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:49,612
So...

731
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:51,809
We couldn't afford the nice
apartment just the two of us, right?

732
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:53,811
Hardwood floors
and a washer/dryer.

733
00:35:53,835 --> 00:35:56,155
What can I say? I
want what I want.

734
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,855
She'll forgive us, right? Well,
she won't remember anything.

735
00:36:03,879 --> 00:36:05,244
A picture, right?

736
00:36:05,313 --> 00:36:07,046
Yeah, picture. Yes.

737
00:36:07,115 --> 00:36:10,950
Here we go. Here we
go. Yeah. Happy birthday!

738
00:36:11,019 --> 00:36:12,551
Happy birthday.

739
00:36:13,855 --> 00:36:15,815
Perfect! Da-da.

740
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:34,473
Happy 10,000th, Dr. Webber.

741
00:36:35,243 --> 00:36:36,742
For me? No.

742
00:36:36,812 --> 00:36:40,296
Come on. It's not every day you
get to celebrate 10,000 surgeries.

743
00:36:50,258 --> 00:36:51,474
Thanks.

744
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:57,914
Hey, the dress you guys
got Zola? She loved it.

745
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:00,133
Sofia loved it, too.

746
00:37:00,202 --> 00:37:01,467
Didn't you love it, Mark?

747
00:37:02,337 --> 00:37:03,903
It was adorable.

748
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:05,788
What can I say?
I have great taste.

749
00:37:07,008 --> 00:37:08,675
I'm gonna get a refill. Anyone?

750
00:37:08,743 --> 00:37:10,743
Oh, I would love a glass of red.

751
00:37:15,133 --> 00:37:16,833
Enough of that. Oh, Mark.

752
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:18,684
You two are the
ones that love her.

753
00:37:18,753 --> 00:37:20,231
It's like you want to take
her behind a mini-mart,

754
00:37:20,255 --> 00:37:21,888
knock her up, and
have all her babies.

755
00:37:21,956 --> 00:37:24,034
Oh, my God. You guys would
have such beautiful babies.

756
00:37:24,058 --> 00:37:25,220
Well, then Sofia
would have a sibling.

757
00:37:25,244 --> 00:37:27,143
Except I'm not there yet.

758
00:37:27,212 --> 00:37:30,530
She's great, and I'm
happy you all get along,

759
00:37:30,598 --> 00:37:32,966
but I'm not rushing this.
I rushed it with Addison.

760
00:37:33,034 --> 00:37:36,820
I tried to force Lexie to be a
grandmother, for God sakes.

761
00:37:36,888 --> 00:37:38,989
I'm not doing that again.

762
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:42,191
Wow. That is so adult.

763
00:37:45,647 --> 00:37:47,558
You know what Aunty
Cristina did today?

764
00:37:47,582 --> 00:37:49,816
I operated on a heart.

765
00:37:49,884 --> 00:37:51,784
This... Actually, no.

766
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:54,254
This big. This big.

767
00:37:54,322 --> 00:37:56,522
It was as big as a bear.

768
00:38:14,642 --> 00:38:17,526
They're not called lost
causes because they're fun.

769
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:19,440
I don't need them to be fun.

770
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:21,825
I just need them
to not be like today.

771
00:38:21,849 --> 00:38:22,916
Mmm.

772
00:38:22,984 --> 00:38:24,634
Okay. Let's flip.

773
00:38:26,354 --> 00:38:28,438
Heads, you keep
doing lost causes.

774
00:38:28,507 --> 00:38:30,147
Tails, you do the fun stuff.

775
00:38:30,925 --> 00:38:33,042
I'm in. Of course I'm in.

776
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:36,479
Good. Come on.

777
00:38:36,548 --> 00:38:37,780
Let's go join the party.

778
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:39,032
Okay.

779
00:38:46,191 --> 00:38:48,086
I know you're
mad, and I'm sorry.

780
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:51,377
Sorry that you did it, or
you're sorry that I'm mad?

781
00:38:56,868 --> 00:38:59,469
Teddy never came to
find me after surgery.

782
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:01,620
Yeah, well, she's tired. I bet.

783
00:39:03,725 --> 00:39:06,592
I'm taking you off her
service permanently.

784
00:39:06,661 --> 00:39:08,294
I'm not sure what she's gonna do

785
00:39:08,363 --> 00:39:09,974
without you as her
security blanket...

786
00:39:09,998 --> 00:39:11,718
Absolutely not. Well,

787
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,627
this is the downside... Did
you hear what I just said?

788
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:15,284
Absolutely not.

789
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:19,656
I think "thank you" is what you
were looking for, because frankly,

790
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:20,957
I could've fired you both.

791
00:39:22,644 --> 00:39:24,505
You have no idea what's
going on here, do you?

792
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,579
I have a very good idea.

793
00:39:26,648 --> 00:39:30,416
You let me operate on her
husband, and now he's dead.

794
00:39:30,485 --> 00:39:32,786
She gets whatever she
wants. Do you understand?

795
00:39:32,854 --> 00:39:34,637
Anything she
wants from me, ever.

796
00:39:37,676 --> 00:39:39,075
I heard the good news.

797
00:39:39,144 --> 00:39:40,943
Bailey says you're
declaring general.

798
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:43,012
Actually, I'm not sure anymore.

799
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,647
Oh, okay.

800
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:46,415
Thought it was a done deal.

801
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:47,678
I mean, it makes
sense since you're...

802
00:39:47,702 --> 00:39:49,347
Because of my mother, I know.

803
00:39:49,371 --> 00:39:50,965
Don't you mention her, too.
That's all anyone ever says.

804
00:39:50,989 --> 00:39:52,533
"It's in my blood,
it's my legacy."

805
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:54,101
That's why I
don't want to do it.

806
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:55,652
I don't want to
be like my mother.

807
00:39:55,676 --> 00:39:59,395
Meredith, look at
everything you did today,

808
00:39:59,464 --> 00:40:04,768
this party for your daughter,
what you did for me in that OR.

809
00:40:04,836 --> 00:40:07,837
You don't have to ever worry about
being anything like your mother.

810
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:10,239
I knew her,

811
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:12,992
and you're nothing
like your mother.

812
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:16,546
You have a gift.

813
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:18,748
Don't waste it.

814
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:23,019
It was an impossible
situation. Yes.

815
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:25,221
And it was your call.

816
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:27,807
You put Henry on my table.

817
00:40:27,875 --> 00:40:31,427
And then you had me lie
to Teddy, just like you did.

818
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:34,197
Those were your decisions.
Now, you want to be chief?

819
00:40:34,266 --> 00:40:35,397
These are the consequences.

820
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:36,927
Don't talk to me
about consequences.

821
00:40:36,951 --> 00:40:40,920
You can't even accept a simple
punishment for what you did today.

822
00:40:40,989 --> 00:40:44,240
You don't get to punish me.
It's not my fault Teddy hates you.

823
00:40:44,308 --> 00:40:46,453
But don't take your
guilt out on me. Guilt?

824
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:49,829
I have nothing to be guilty
about. This is all about you.

825
00:40:49,898 --> 00:40:52,009
It's always been about
you. It's what you want.

826
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:53,710
That's always
been your position.

827
00:40:53,734 --> 00:40:56,352
We live like you want,
and how you want.

828
00:40:56,421 --> 00:40:59,689
You get whatever
you want, all the time!

829
00:40:59,758 --> 00:41:02,002
<i>When do you throw in the towel,</i>

830
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:04,793
<i>admit that a lost cause
is sometimes just that?</i>

831
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:06,890
Hey, do you remember
your first surgery?

832
00:41:06,914 --> 00:41:09,716
Well, sure. I was a
third-year resident.

833
00:41:09,784 --> 00:41:11,968
Third-years could take
the lead on surgeries.

834
00:41:12,037 --> 00:41:14,120
A gallbladder.

835
00:41:14,189 --> 00:41:17,072
Constantly! You do what
works for you. You don't care...

836
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,203
<i>There comes a point when
it all becomes too much.</i>

837
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:20,777
Or who gets hurt!

838
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:22,578
It was one surgery.

839
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:24,397
Okay? It was one surgery.

840
00:41:24,466 --> 00:41:27,083
It was not one surgery!
Do you hear me?

841
00:41:27,152 --> 00:41:29,585
This was every choice
we've made in the last...

842
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:32,321
It was a life that I
envisioned for myself, okay?

843
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:35,307
This is not one surgery.

844
00:41:35,376 --> 00:41:38,077
<i>When we get too
tired to fight anymore.</i>

845
00:41:38,813 --> 00:41:40,346
<i>So we give up.</i>

846
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:42,281
It all comes back to this?

847
00:41:43,568 --> 00:41:45,101
Yeah.

848
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:48,170
Crazy, right? That I would
ever bring it up again.

849
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:50,990
Yes, okay? Yes. Yes!

850
00:41:51,058 --> 00:41:54,371
Okay? It was a horrible
situation, but it's over.

851
00:41:54,395 --> 00:41:57,308
Is it too much to ask that
we just try and forget it?

852
00:41:57,332 --> 00:42:00,466
You killed our baby!
