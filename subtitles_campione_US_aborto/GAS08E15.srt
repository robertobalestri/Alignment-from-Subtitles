1
00:00:03,704 --> 00:00:05,270
We fight.

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:06,638
No, we don't.

3
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:09,041
You yell and then you go silent.

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:11,010
I yell because you...

5
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:14,491
We don't communicate.

6
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:16,815
There's no intimacy.

7
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:17,983
There's intimacy.

8
00:00:18,052 --> 00:00:20,063
Okay. All right.
There's intimacy,

9
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:22,265
but we're not on the same page.

10
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,656
Because I don't do
what you want me to do.

11
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:27,006
Because you had an abortion.

12
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:32,164
We've done couples
therapy before.

13
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:33,233
He has PTSD.

14
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,112
From the war, and
she's had it, too.

15
00:00:35,136 --> 00:00:36,629
From the shooting,
but not at the same time.

16
00:00:36,653 --> 00:00:39,421
We didn't have it
at the same time.

17
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:40,956
And mine wasn't
as bad as his is.

18
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,221
You lay on the floor of an OR.

19
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:46,085
You choked me. You
quit being a doctor.

20
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,762
So...

21
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,416
For a little while.

22
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:52,650
But now we're fine.

23
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:57,022
Really?

24
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:59,824
Oh, sure. Okay. We're fine.

25
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:01,559
I meant the PTSD.

26
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:03,695
Okay. Yeah. We're fine.

27
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:09,601
We're fine.

28
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:13,717
Except for the part where you
aborted the child that I wanted.

29
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,707
Except for the part
where you held my hand

30
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,342
while I exercised
my right to choose,

31
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,556
and then four months later,
you screamed I killed your baby

32
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,179
in front of all our friends.

33
00:01:22,383 --> 00:01:24,110
<i>When you've tried everything</i>

34
00:01:24,134 --> 00:01:26,167
<i>but that headache won't go away,</i>

35
00:01:26,236 --> 00:01:28,203
<i>you can't stop coughing,</i>

36
00:01:28,271 --> 00:01:30,171
<i>the swelling won't go down,</i>

37
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,508
<i>that's when you
turn to a professional.</i>

38
00:01:32,576 --> 00:01:34,576
So...

39
00:01:34,645 --> 00:01:37,880
<i>As surgeons, we spend years
developing skills of perception</i>

40
00:01:37,948 --> 00:01:41,349
<i>that allow us to see
exactly what the problem is.</i>

41
00:01:41,418 --> 00:01:43,168
You haven't even looked.

42
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:46,016
Amy, I am telling you, it
is unresectable. Let it go.

43
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,483
I came all the way
from LA to show you this.

44
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:49,090
You could spend
more than 30 seconds.

45
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:50,436
I am looking right at it.

46
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,839
It's a gliosarcoma that has
invaded the carotid artery.

47
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:54,323
You try and remove
it, she will stroke out.

48
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:55,447
Stop being a jackass.

49
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:00,519
I'm... She called... She
called you a jackass.

50
00:02:00,588 --> 00:02:02,053
Dr. Grey, excuse us.

51
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,256
Dr. Grey, stay
here. I need backup.

52
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:05,423
Fine.

53
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:09,628
You just got out of rehab.

54
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:12,776
I want you to get on your
feet. But you can't help her.

55
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:19,171
Look at his face.

56
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:20,355
His name is Mason.

57
00:02:20,424 --> 00:02:22,808
This gliosarcoma belongs
to his mother Erica.

58
00:02:22,877 --> 00:02:25,227
He's a great kid. I
don't know him that well,

59
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:26,444
but he seems great.

60
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:28,713
I do know his dad well.
His name is Cooper,

61
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:30,782
and he works with me
and he is a good guy.

62
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:33,218
He is a good dad, which
means he is the one

63
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:35,365
who is gonna have to tell
Mason that his mom is dead.

64
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:36,888
That he doesn't
have a mom anymore

65
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:38,272
because we didn't do anything.

66
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:40,742
You tell Cooper
you're sorry. You tried.

67
00:02:40,811 --> 00:02:42,110
Let it go.

68
00:02:42,178 --> 00:02:43,661
I have a surgery.

69
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,264
<i>Trouble is,</i>

70
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:49,267
<i>sometimes all that time spent
developing those skills of perception</i>

71
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:52,804
<i>can leave a person with an
extremely narrow point of view.</i>

72
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:54,684
<i>And how are you supposed
to argue with someone</i>

73
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,875
<i>who has science on their side?</i>

74
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:59,856
65-year-old woman
enters the ER. In shock.

75
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,320
Presents with a pulsatile,
expanding abdominal mass.

76
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:03,581
Go.

77
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,916
Ruptured triple-A.

78
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:07,185
I would take the patient
straight to the OR.

79
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:09,015
And access the peritoneal cavity

80
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:11,033
through a vertical
midline incision.

81
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:12,640
Nice.

82
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:14,504
You guys studying for the oral
boards in the middle of the day?

83
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,105
Just another benefit of
having a study buddy.

84
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:17,506
You should get one. I have one.

85
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,630
It's just that my stupid
study buddy's too busy

86
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,183
trying to save her stupid
marriage to actually help me study.

87
00:03:22,252 --> 00:03:23,847
Well, you know what's
better than a study buddy?

88
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,437
A study lackey. Check it.

89
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,106
Hey, you.

90
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:30,359
Brown-haired girl, you're up.

91
00:03:30,427 --> 00:03:32,005
Trauma incident or
a surgical situation?

92
00:03:32,029 --> 00:03:33,806
You made your interns
come up with study questions?

93
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:34,979
Surprise me.

94
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,375
A 12-year-old
boy fell off his bike,

95
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:38,428
hitting his abdomen
against the handlebars.

96
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:40,932
Complains of progressive
abdominal pain and is short of breath.

97
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,170
What is it?

98
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,606
Sloan. 911.

99
00:03:44,674 --> 00:03:45,940
Hey, if you want, we could...

100
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:47,821
I don't need help. I'm
an excellent surgeon.

101
00:03:47,845 --> 00:03:51,129
You know it, and I know
it. Everybody knows it.

102
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:52,525
I don't have to prove
myself to anyone.

103
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:54,883
Yeah, except to the
American Board of Surgery.

104
00:03:54,952 --> 00:03:56,000
Yeah, there's them.

105
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:10,315
Meredith Grey.

106
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:12,984
No.

107
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,019
Not Grey.

108
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,437
Yang, maybe.

109
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,306
Yang's a cowboy.

110
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:20,174
Kepner.

111
00:04:20,243 --> 00:04:21,293
Kepner?

112
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:23,695
Not Kepner.

113
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:24,930
Definitely not Grey.

114
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,242
She spent all
that time in neuro,

115
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,443
and suddenly, she's
chasing general.

116
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:28,900
She's unfocused.

117
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:30,852
You're underestimating her.

118
00:04:30,921 --> 00:04:33,104
I think she'd surprise you.

119
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:34,622
She'd have to.

120
00:04:35,258 --> 00:04:36,358
She will.

121
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,328
She'll have to come to me.

122
00:04:52,843 --> 00:04:54,626
I'd do an exploratory
laparotomy.

123
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:55,772
You said that already.

124
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,678
I know. Um...

125
00:04:57,748 --> 00:05:00,268
The patient's still
crashing? Yep.

126
00:05:00,984 --> 00:05:02,867
Oh! I gotta crack
open his chest.

127
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:04,136
You've gotta what?

128
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,403
Relax. Not you.

129
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:06,587
Good morning, Chuck.

130
00:05:06,674 --> 00:05:08,206
Hey, Karev. And, Dr. Peterson,

131
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:09,302
it's always nice
to see you in peds.

132
00:05:09,326 --> 00:05:10,641
Thank you, Dr. Robbins.

133
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,788
So, Chuck's looking pretty good.

134
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,774
His abdominal pain's decreased,

135
00:05:14,798 --> 00:05:17,449
and I think it's a good time
to schedule a gastroscopy.

136
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:19,662
Great, great. Well, then,
you're in luck, Dr. Peterson,

137
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:22,304
because I think that Karev
would be an excellent supervisor

138
00:05:22,372 --> 00:05:24,172
for your first gastroscopy.

139
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,573
Thank you.

140
00:05:25,642 --> 00:05:28,694
Okay, Megan. Let's go
schedule that gastroscopy.

141
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:29,906
Uh, it's Morgan.

142
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,174
What is? My name.

143
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:32,198
It's Morgan.

144
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:35,400
Whatever. Same difference.

145
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:38,619
Carrie Rissler is my patient.
Has been for eight years.

146
00:05:38,688 --> 00:05:39,754
I'm aware.

147
00:05:39,823 --> 00:05:41,256
She was given
six months to live,

148
00:05:41,325 --> 00:05:43,524
but after a mastectomy,
oophorectomy,

149
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:46,311
and risky experimental
biological therapy,

150
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,112
I managed to save her life.

151
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:49,481
Which is awesome.

152
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,116
No, it is not awesome.
It is a miracle.

153
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:56,771
And when I saw on the OR
board that my patient, my miracle,

154
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,491
is undergoing a lymph node
transfer without my knowledge...

155
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:01,843
She came to us, Dr. Bailey.

156
00:06:01,912 --> 00:06:03,355
Said she brought it to
you a few months ago,

157
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:04,746
and you shot it down.

158
00:06:04,815 --> 00:06:07,515
'Cause her extensive scarring
makes her a poor candidate.

159
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,713
That's what I thought.
But then Avery suggested

160
00:06:09,737 --> 00:06:11,181
we do some angio
studies on her arm...

161
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:12,445
Avery suggested?

162
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,901
Dr. Bailey, this procedure
has had outstanding results

163
00:06:14,925 --> 00:06:17,903
for patients with vessels
just like Mrs. Rissler's, okay?

164
00:06:17,927 --> 00:06:20,695
This could make it worse.
It could even kill her.

165
00:06:20,764 --> 00:06:22,146
That's not gonna happen.

166
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,082
Well, you're right, it's not,

167
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,628
because you're not operating,

168
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:28,012
not after I speak to my patient.

169
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:32,635
You paged me
911 to get yelled at?

170
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,726
No, I paged you 911 so
that you could help me

171
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,739
convince Bailey we're
doing the right thing here.

172
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:37,829
You failed.

173
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,547
Okay. So what do we do now?

174
00:06:39,616 --> 00:06:42,617
Well, let's hope Carrie's a little
bit more persuasive than you are.

175
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,773
Dr. Torres,
Dr. Webber suggested...

176
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:49,719
Here's how this is gonna
work. I talk, and you listen.

177
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,471
You are here because
you and your little pals

178
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:52,972
are all freaked out
about the oral boards,

179
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,607
and Dr. Webber
suggested that Callie Torres

180
00:06:54,631 --> 00:06:57,565
might have a special
secret study method, right?

181
00:06:57,634 --> 00:06:59,011
Mmm-hmm. Yeah,
Dr. Webber's correct.

182
00:06:59,035 --> 00:07:00,930
Callie Torres does
have a study method,

183
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:02,194
an excellent study method,

184
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:03,783
but she's not about
to just give it away.

185
00:07:03,807 --> 00:07:05,518
Callie Torres' study
method has to be earned.

186
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:06,903
Frankly, she doesn't think that

187
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,887
Meredith Grey has what it takes.

188
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:13,598
I think she does. I think
Meredith Grey has what it takes.

189
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,549
His BP was low and his
vessels are collapsed.

190
00:07:15,618 --> 00:07:16,862
We could only
get one good IV in.

191
00:07:16,886 --> 00:07:18,197
We're gonna have
to get another one.

192
00:07:18,221 --> 00:07:20,422
For her sake, Meredith
Grey better hope she's right,

193
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:21,523
'cause today,

194
00:07:22,292 --> 00:07:23,891
today is gonna be a grind.

195
00:07:25,061 --> 00:07:26,394
Excuse me. Coming through.

196
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,678
Excuse me.

197
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:32,717
A grind? Really?

198
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:34,202
It's a meat grinder.

199
00:07:34,271 --> 00:07:36,287
Whatever. Like you
weren't thinking it, too.

200
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,569
Hang in there, Dom.

201
00:07:56,593 --> 00:07:58,471
Yeah, you're looking
good, bro, real good.

202
00:07:58,495 --> 00:07:59,961
You're lying, Tommy.

203
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:01,996
I look like sopressata.

204
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,192
Don't worry, Dominic. We just
gave you some drugs for the pain.

205
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:04,332
Okay.

206
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,284
You're gonna start to
feel better real quick.

207
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:08,620
What do you think, Dr. Torres?
Is this an amputation?

208
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:11,467
I don't know. Is it?

209
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,524
What?

210
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:13,832
No, you tell me, Dr. Grey.

211
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:16,294
Does this look like
an amputation to you?

212
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:18,129
I mean, yeah.

213
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:21,582
Amputate? No, you
can't. I need my hand.

214
00:08:21,651 --> 00:08:22,745
Tommy, don't let them take my...

215
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:24,519
All right.

216
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:26,198
Whoa! Is he... No,
those are the drugs.

217
00:08:26,222 --> 00:08:27,767
They work quickly,
just like we have to.

218
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,301
But you're just gonna
cut off his arm? I mean, I...

219
00:08:29,325 --> 00:08:31,259
No, this is a teaching
hospital, Mike, okay?

220
00:08:31,327 --> 00:08:32,577
I'm doing a thing.

221
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,057
Grey, here's how it's gonna work

222
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:36,526
if you want my
help on the boards.

223
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,277
You're gonna run this. You're
gonna decide our course of action.

224
00:08:38,301 --> 00:08:40,768
You're gonna be the person
that stands between Dominic

225
00:08:40,837 --> 00:08:43,554
and a hook for a
hand. You in or you out?

226
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:45,956
I already said amputation
is our best option.

227
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,325
Oh. Best? Yeah, best.

228
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:49,305
Okay, so book an OR.
And fire up the bone saw.

229
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:51,649
Let's move him out, people.
Grey wants to amputate.

230
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,080
Yeah.

231
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:54,549
Dr. Torres, wait.

232
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:56,351
I have a finger here.

233
00:08:56,419 --> 00:08:57,730
I knew that already, Dr. Grey.

234
00:08:57,754 --> 00:08:59,137
No, a viable finger.

235
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,940
Look at the cap refill.

236
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:04,809
Is that bad or good?

237
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,121
Dr. Grey, is that bad or good?

238
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:07,812
That's good.

239
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,408
All right. So what
do you want to do?

240
00:09:09,432 --> 00:09:10,960
I think we should take this
thing off and see what's left.

241
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:12,228
All right. Time's a
factor here, Grey.

242
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:13,412
Why is time a factor?

243
00:09:13,436 --> 00:09:14,947
Because the longer
his hand stays in there,

244
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,482
the more we
compromise his circulation.

245
00:09:16,506 --> 00:09:17,655
Tick tock, Dr. Grey.

246
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,868
So let's call up to
maintenance and get a Sawzall.

247
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,336
Mmm. You really
want to wait that long?

248
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,989
Fire and rescue
has tools. Better.

249
00:09:23,013 --> 00:09:24,445
Okay.

250
00:09:25,682 --> 00:09:27,293
Hey, these tools,
what are they gonna do,

251
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,557
rip apart the grinder?

252
00:09:28,585 --> 00:09:29,851
To save his hand.

253
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,730
Yeah, we dropped a
couple grand on that thing.

254
00:09:31,754 --> 00:09:32,987
You can't trash it.

255
00:09:33,056 --> 00:09:34,906
To save his hand?

256
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,415
Mike, how long is it gonna
take you to get that thing apart?

257
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:39,538
I take it apart and
clean it every night.

258
00:09:39,562 --> 00:09:40,895
We can get him out. Yeah.

259
00:09:40,963 --> 00:09:42,597
Dr. Torres?

260
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,666
Can you do it in
under 45 minutes?

261
00:09:44,735 --> 00:09:46,835
Give or take.

262
00:09:46,903 --> 00:09:48,414
Grey? MEREDITH: Dr. Grey what?

263
00:09:48,438 --> 00:09:50,182
Do I think it's okay to
let a couple of civilians

264
00:09:50,206 --> 00:09:52,418
take apart the machine that's
grinding their brother's hand?

265
00:09:52,442 --> 00:09:54,392
Yeah.

266
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:57,940
Let's do it. Okay.

267
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:59,191
I'm gonna need a
set of Allen wrenches

268
00:09:59,215 --> 00:10:00,425
and a Phillips head screwdriver.

269
00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:01,733
Make that two.

270
00:10:02,252 --> 00:10:03,301
Stat!

271
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,535
Hang in there, Dom.

272
00:10:10,593 --> 00:10:12,160
Hey, you paged?

273
00:10:12,229 --> 00:10:16,264
Look, I can remove the tumor
and the diseased carotid together.

274
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,044
All I have to do is
run balloon catheters

275
00:10:18,068 --> 00:10:20,079
in through the femoral,
place them in precise position,

276
00:10:20,103 --> 00:10:23,216
inflate them to stop the blood
flow, do two arteriotomies,

277
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,139
then feed a heparinized
shunt into place,

278
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,708
and reestablish blood flow.

279
00:10:26,776 --> 00:10:28,443
That's all?

280
00:10:28,511 --> 00:10:30,623
Oh. And I have to
do it in 90 seconds.

281
00:10:30,647 --> 00:10:32,858
Any more than that,
and she strokes out.

282
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,399
Is that even possible?

283
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,868
Not sure. I would
love to test it out.

284
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,219
We should set up a simulator.

285
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,516
Don't we need to
get Derek's approval?

286
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,934
Yeah, but that shouldn't
be a big problem...

287
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,658
He loves to say no to me.

288
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,727
That is his
favorite thing to do.

289
00:10:45,795 --> 00:10:48,029
Maybe you should refrain
from calling him a jackass.

290
00:10:48,098 --> 00:10:50,782
I can't help it,
'cause he is one.

291
00:10:52,702 --> 00:10:54,542
Maybe I should
ask him. Would you?

292
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:55,571
Yeah.

293
00:10:55,638 --> 00:10:56,878
He's in surgery, OR two.

294
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:04,028
You just called me down here
so that I would go to Derek for you.

295
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:06,180
Made me feel
like it was my idea.

296
00:11:07,116 --> 00:11:08,600
Aren't I good?

297
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,934
Amazing.

298
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,499
I have always been clear.

299
00:11:14,523 --> 00:11:15,652
You have not always been clear.

300
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:16,819
She loves to say that.

301
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,977
Always been clear,
I do not want kids.

302
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:20,556
He knew that. I
did not know that.

303
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,612
You knew that.

304
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:23,359
I did not know that
in the beginning.

305
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:25,494
What, I have an icicle in me,
and I'm supposed to tell a stranger,

306
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,235
"Hey, I don't want
to have kids?"

307
00:11:27,304 --> 00:11:29,948
I'm not talking about the
icicle. I am talking about after.

308
00:11:29,972 --> 00:11:31,306
After.

309
00:11:31,374 --> 00:11:33,941
No, I told you when it was
relevant to the relationship.

310
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,088
Most people would've considered
dropping a bomb like that

311
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,457
before the wedding. That is
when it would've been relevant.

312
00:11:38,481 --> 00:11:41,816
Well, you proposed and we
were married, like, 12 hours later.

313
00:11:41,885 --> 00:11:44,565
So sue me if, in the moment,
I was thinking of other things.

314
00:11:49,091 --> 00:11:51,892
I know the lymphedema is bad.

315
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,260
Oh, it's miserable.

316
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,496
These are sausages, not arms.

317
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:58,316
I can't lift them. Oh!

318
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,544
I'm in pain all the time.

319
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:01,252
I think...

320
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:05,615
Look, we just need to be
happy the cancer is gone

321
00:12:05,675 --> 00:12:07,792
and look at the lymphedema as

322
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:11,495
the price we're paying...

323
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,913
The price I'm paying.

324
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,933
Oh, look...

325
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:17,501
You don't think I felt awful,

326
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:21,455
sneaking in here like a
thief to get my surgery?

327
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,310
You saved my life.

328
00:12:28,798 --> 00:12:31,416
You know how I feel about
you. You're a hero to me.

329
00:12:32,702 --> 00:12:33,851
But I...

330
00:12:33,903 --> 00:12:36,504
I want to be able
to brush my hair...

331
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:38,839
Hold my grandson.

332
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:40,920
Erin had a baby?

333
00:12:40,944 --> 00:12:43,327
Having one, in the spring.

334
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:47,298
Oh, my... She was just starting
college when you were first diagnosed.

335
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:49,233
I know.

336
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:51,819
You promised me I'd
make it to her graduation.

337
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:59,244
If you really think
this is a mistake,

338
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:00,762
I won't do it.

339
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,963
Okay. You got it?
You got it? I got it.

340
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:08,953
So what's your plan, Grey?

341
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:10,933
Okay, my plan is, they get this
thing off, and then we assess.

342
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,101
Right, but what if they don't?

343
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,169
You need an alternate plan.

344
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:14,503
Well, I don't need
an alternate plan,

345
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:15,838
because they're
gonna get it off.

346
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,846
What'd you do? I
didn't do anything.

347
00:13:18,915 --> 00:13:21,043
The more you guys loosen
that, the more he's gonna bleed.

348
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:22,250
Should we stop?

349
00:13:22,318 --> 00:13:23,629
No, keep going, just go faster.

350
00:13:23,653 --> 00:13:25,314
You sure you have time for that?

351
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:26,598
If you have something
to suggest, why don't you?

352
00:13:26,622 --> 00:13:28,606
Now you're just
wasting everyone's time.

353
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:30,186
Well, we have to get him up to
the OR or he's gonna bleed out.

354
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,071
Yeah, well, his hand's
still trapped in that grinder.

355
00:13:32,095 --> 00:13:33,573
Let's get a pneumatic tourniquet
on his arm above the grinder.

356
00:13:33,597 --> 00:13:35,274
That'll buy us a few minutes.

357
00:13:35,298 --> 00:13:36,463
Okay.

358
00:13:36,532 --> 00:13:37,877
I can give you guys 15 minutes,

359
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:40,045
and after that, I
have to amputate.

360
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,235
Understood.

361
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:46,601
We've operated on worse.

362
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,194
Lexie, she showed us
a picture of a little boy.

363
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:52,930
I know. It's clear that
she is passionate...

364
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,993
My sister is too emotionally
wrapped up in this patient

365
00:13:55,017 --> 00:13:57,212
to clearly see that she
can't help this woman.

366
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:58,536
You know, it tells me that

367
00:13:58,604 --> 00:13:59,982
she's passionate
enough to try harder.

368
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,634
Yeah, well, all the
passion in the world

369
00:14:01,658 --> 00:14:03,603
is not gonna make her
plan doable in 90 seconds.

370
00:14:03,627 --> 00:14:06,155
You need to see that
for yourself, fine, set it up.

371
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,379
Only you're gonna be
the one who sees a thing.

372
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:09,914
I mean, thank you.

373
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,384
Dr. Robbins said I
would be doing this.

374
00:14:18,408 --> 00:14:21,208
Yeah, how can you do a
gastroscopy and read the index cards?

375
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:22,577
Come on. Keep them coming.

376
00:14:22,646 --> 00:14:25,141
Congenital aganglionic
megacolon, also known as...

377
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:26,165
Hirschsprung's disease.

378
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:27,464
Typical treatment?

379
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:31,002
A pull-through procedure.
Did you skip symptoms?

380
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,620
Uh, symptoms, right. Sorry.

381
00:14:32,689 --> 00:14:34,132
Don't crap out on me now, Megan.

382
00:14:34,156 --> 00:14:35,289
Morgan.

383
00:14:35,358 --> 00:14:36,691
Symptoms are

384
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:38,837
severe and persistent
tightness in chest,

385
00:14:38,861 --> 00:14:41,595
indigestion, blurred
vision, shortness of breath...

386
00:14:41,664 --> 00:14:42,808
Yeah, that's not Hirschsprung's.

387
00:14:42,832 --> 00:14:44,832
Severe headache, nausea.

388
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,712
Patient is 24 weeks pregnant.

389
00:14:46,736 --> 00:14:49,320
Yeah? Well, that narrows
it down. It could be PIH.

390
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:52,707
Yeah, I'd order labs and a UA.
Then I'd take her down to the OB.

391
00:14:52,775 --> 00:14:54,208
So she could be monitored.

392
00:14:54,276 --> 00:14:57,795
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. You
should probably do that.

393
00:14:59,014 --> 00:15:00,514
Hey. Hey. Hey!

394
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:02,099
Hey!

395
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:03,879
Are you gonna just stand
there or are you gonna help her?

396
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:04,903
Morgan?

397
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,617
When were you gonna
tell me you were pregnant?

398
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:11,809
Everybody in this hospital
knows that I'm pregnant.

399
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:14,595
But then they also know my name.

400
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,698
Well, there's a
good fetal heart rate.

401
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:19,300
The baby looks fine. These
are definitely not contractions.

402
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:21,152
List the symptoms.

403
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:22,648
I am not quizzing you right now.

404
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:24,889
No, your symptoms.
Chest tightness...

405
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:28,543
Nausea, shortness
of breath, indigestion.

406
00:15:31,648 --> 00:15:33,264
You mean like heartburn?

407
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,516
Page cardio.

408
00:15:35,585 --> 00:15:37,105
You're having a heart attack.

409
00:15:38,654 --> 00:15:40,687
There is no deeper reason.

410
00:15:40,756 --> 00:15:41,906
There has to be.

411
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:44,492
There is no deeper reason.

412
00:15:44,561 --> 00:15:47,828
I wasn't abused. I
don't have a dark secret.

413
00:15:47,897 --> 00:15:50,965
I wasn't mugged by a
baby. I just don't want kids.

414
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:52,683
Nobody doesn't want kids.

415
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:55,369
People can not
want kids. It's a thing.

416
00:15:55,438 --> 00:15:56,678
That is not a thing.

417
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:59,457
Well, it's my thing.

418
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:09,216
You're gonna change your mind.

419
00:16:09,285 --> 00:16:11,525
You're gonna change your
mind in three years or five.

420
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:14,316
You're gonna change your
mind about having a baby,

421
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,785
and then it's gonna be too
late. And you're gonna regret it.

422
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,077
And I will know and understand

423
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,513
that I made a choice.

424
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:25,266
I choose medicine. I choose me.

425
00:16:25,335 --> 00:16:28,101
I choose that over
the remote possibility

426
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:30,955
that I might one day
regret not having a child.

427
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:36,260
And by the way, it's all
right to never want kids.

428
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,757
Some people don't
ever want kids.

429
00:16:37,781 --> 00:16:39,614
Well, I want to know why.

430
00:16:39,682 --> 00:16:40,981
Why?

431
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,356
In 2004, I was removing mets

432
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,404
from Carrie Rissler's
abdomen and pelvis,

433
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:54,606
and decided to go for one near her
liver when she started bleeding out.

434
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:57,393
As I was trying to stop the
bleeding, she went into heart failure.

435
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:59,128
I had to send her to the ICU,

436
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:01,564
tell her daughter Erin
that she was in a coma

437
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:03,565
and that there was a good
chance she wouldn't wake up.

438
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:04,922
But she did.

439
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:07,003
And she still had two
more surgeries ahead of her

440
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:08,792
and chemo and radiation.

441
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,072
Her body is a battlefield...

442
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:12,380
I get it. You
talked her out of it.

443
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,283
No.

444
00:17:15,351 --> 00:17:17,129
You're doing the
lymph node transfer,

445
00:17:17,153 --> 00:17:21,155
but not without reading
every page of this file twice.

446
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:22,901
But we're supposed to
operate in half an hour.

447
00:17:22,925 --> 00:17:24,425
Then start reading.

448
00:17:24,493 --> 00:17:25,509
Okay.

449
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:29,730
I'm watching you, Avery.

450
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:31,866
Yes, ma'am.

451
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,273
- Come on.
- I almost got it.

452
00:17:39,342 --> 00:17:40,852
Come on. Come on.
BP's dropping, Grey.

453
00:17:40,876 --> 00:17:43,196
You guys need to be done now.

454
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,479
Just one second, Dr. Grey.

455
00:17:45,548 --> 00:17:47,014
Just one more...

456
00:17:47,082 --> 00:17:48,582
And done.

457
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,629
We should be able to turn
back the auger and pull him out.

458
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,665
No, we'll pull him out.
It's time for you to go.

459
00:17:52,689 --> 00:17:55,569
Grey, take this. You've
got the auger. Okay.

460
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,223
Look, can't we just
stick around and see...

461
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,546
There we go.

462
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:05,716
Holy God.

463
00:18:12,074 --> 00:18:15,743
Okay, so... We've got a piece
of hand with sort of fingers on it.

464
00:18:18,248 --> 00:18:20,915
What about these?
Can these be saved?

465
00:18:20,984 --> 00:18:22,366
I don't know. Can they?

466
00:18:28,891 --> 00:18:30,024
Boom!

467
00:18:31,293 --> 00:18:32,393
97 seconds.

468
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:34,545
Bite me!

469
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:37,214
Sorry.

470
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,515
Just...

471
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:40,968
Sorry. I just...

472
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:44,271
I've been at 97 seconds
for eight freaking tries now.

473
00:18:44,339 --> 00:18:46,040
Maybe not the ninth.

474
00:18:46,108 --> 00:18:47,819
If I can find another stopwatch.

475
00:18:47,843 --> 00:18:49,560
I mean, Derek's probably right.

476
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:52,145
I'm just... I'm
gonna let her down.

477
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,398
He should know. I've let
him down enough times.

478
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,468
Let's take a break.

479
00:18:57,537 --> 00:19:00,937
Let's go... You want
to get something to eat?

480
00:19:03,692 --> 00:19:04,959
I want something.

481
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:07,795
It's not food.

482
00:19:11,301 --> 00:19:14,501
There's a guy who got his
hand stuck in a meat grinder.

483
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:19,656
I wouldn't mind seeing that.

484
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:21,325
Yes.

485
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:26,308
Okay, Morgan,
you had an acute MI

486
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:28,482
from a spontaneous
coronary artery dissection.

487
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,750
Are you kidding? I don't
have any of the risk factors.

488
00:19:30,787 --> 00:19:33,671
Yeah, well, most likely,
related to your pregnancy.

489
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,189
We need to get you
upstairs right now.

490
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:38,058
Dr. Robbins, why are you here?

491
00:19:38,127 --> 00:19:39,722
We need to repair the
dissection immediately.

492
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:41,707
My baby's fine, right? You
said that my baby was fine?

493
00:19:41,731 --> 00:19:42,824
Morgan, listen to me...

494
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,464
If my baby's fine,
why are you here?

495
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:45,828
Lie back, lie
back, listen to me.

496
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:47,772
All right, we need
to go right now.

497
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:49,631
But it's too early to
take the baby out.

498
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:51,367
He, she could have
RDS or get septic?

499
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:52,756
The dissection's extensive.

500
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:54,908
We have to put you on
bypass in order to fix it,

501
00:19:54,977 --> 00:19:56,454
so the baby needs
to be delivered now.

502
00:19:56,478 --> 00:19:57,895
She barely has any lungs.

503
00:19:57,963 --> 00:19:59,008
Twenty-four weeks is premature,

504
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:00,242
but there's a very good chance.

505
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:01,727
No, you can't say that, okay?

506
00:20:01,751 --> 00:20:03,678
I know what you can and
can't say is very good...

507
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:04,880
And you can't say that.

508
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:06,504
My baby was born at 23 weeks,

509
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:08,617
and it's terrifying, I know,
but I'll be here for you.

510
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:09,757
We're all gonna be here.

511
00:20:09,826 --> 00:20:11,070
Will someone call my boyfriend?

512
00:20:11,094 --> 00:20:12,304
His name is the
first in my phone.

513
00:20:12,328 --> 00:20:13,538
All right. Karev,
call her boyfriend

514
00:20:13,562 --> 00:20:14,706
and let him know
what's happening.

515
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:15,862
I'm scrubbing in.

516
00:20:15,931 --> 00:20:17,059
She's your intern, Karev.

517
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,532
Yeah, okay.

518
00:20:19,535 --> 00:20:20,868
Uh, wait...

519
00:20:22,205 --> 00:20:23,537
Her name's, Megan, right?

520
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,290
Her name is Morgan.

521
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:37,601
Ugh!

522
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,484
Grey, I'm surprised.

523
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:43,785
I wouldn't think you'd be thrown

524
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:45,037
by a little thing like
a severed finger.

525
00:20:45,061 --> 00:20:47,478
Yeah, well, it's just,
it smells like pork.

526
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:49,864
Mmm-hmm.

527
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,884
There she goes again.
She's gonna yack.

528
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:55,397
Would you quit it
with that, all right?

529
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:56,882
I gotta finish this thing
before I go into surgery.

530
00:20:56,906 --> 00:20:58,517
Hey, where is your study lackey?

531
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:01,542
Of course the one competent
intern in the whole program

532
00:21:01,611 --> 00:21:03,160
just so happens to be pregnant

533
00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:06,013
and needs surgery for a
coronary artery dissection.

534
00:21:06,082 --> 00:21:07,848
Morgan needs surgery?

535
00:21:07,917 --> 00:21:09,399
How do you know about Morgan?

536
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:12,136
Everybody knows about
the pregnant intern, Karev.

537
00:21:15,908 --> 00:21:17,408
There's my ride.

538
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,977
Here we go.

539
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:23,408
If Morgan needs surgery,
then why are you here?

540
00:21:23,432 --> 00:21:26,216
My attending gave me
a job, call the boyfriend.

541
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,252
I left, like, six messages.

542
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,182
Chris is a fourth year
at the Cleveland Clinic.

543
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:31,917
I mean, you know
how busy it gets.

544
00:21:31,941 --> 00:21:33,306
How do you know his name?

545
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,054
They're not just amputating
and fitting him for a prosthetic?

546
00:21:36,078 --> 00:21:37,745
No. She thinks
she's gonna be able

547
00:21:37,813 --> 00:21:39,446
to salvage the finger
bits and reattach

548
00:21:39,515 --> 00:21:41,264
because she's cracked.

549
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,333
That's gonna be so much harder.

550
00:21:44,437 --> 00:21:46,570
You know what else
would be harder?

551
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:47,955
Going through the carotid.

552
00:21:48,824 --> 00:21:49,840
For fingers?

553
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:51,642
It would be harder,

554
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,790
but there'd be better control
than going through the femoral.

555
00:21:58,217 --> 00:22:00,467
All right. All right. Come
on. Here we go again.

556
00:22:00,536 --> 00:22:03,470
Come on, Mer. Just a few chunks.

557
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:05,556
Come on. Just puke already.

558
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,725
Oh, that's a
good-looking lymph node.

559
00:22:09,062 --> 00:22:11,311
You got it? Yeah.

560
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,508
- Oop!
- Did he say "oops"?

561
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:15,182
Dr. Bailey.

562
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:16,751
What a pleasant surprise.

563
00:22:16,819 --> 00:22:18,597
The man said "oops."
JACKSON: I didn't.

564
00:22:18,621 --> 00:22:21,388
Actually, Dr. Bailey,
I just said "oop."

565
00:22:21,457 --> 00:22:24,653
He was picking up a lymph
node, almost dropped it, but didn't.

566
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:26,637
Let's make some
room so Dr. Bailey

567
00:22:26,662 --> 00:22:28,782
can get a better view
of our every move.

568
00:22:31,233 --> 00:22:32,473
As you were, Avery.

569
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:40,073
You don't want a little
more suction, Avery?

570
00:22:40,142 --> 00:22:42,353
Dr. Bailey, while I'm always
glad to hear your perspective,

571
00:22:42,377 --> 00:22:43,827
I'll instruct the resident.

572
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:45,641
But your instructions
result in oops.

573
00:22:45,665 --> 00:22:47,248
We don't oops in my OR.

574
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,380
Let's try a little more suction.

575
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,241
With Mr. Hamilton's laminectomy,

576
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,577
I want an epidural drain
for the next few days.

577
00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:02,112
Yes, Doctor.

578
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,492
You should at
least listen to her.

579
00:23:03,516 --> 00:23:05,193
Look, I swear, you gotta
stop encouraging her.

580
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,595
Well, this is what
you taught me to do.

581
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:08,463
You taught me to not give
up until we've tried everything.

582
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:09,886
Because you can handle it.

583
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:11,688
When we lose a patient,

584
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:13,067
I know if you're
okay or you're not

585
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:14,319
because I'm right
there with you.

586
00:23:14,343 --> 00:23:16,243
With her, I cannot do that,

587
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:18,362
because I don't think
she can handle it. Not now.

588
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:21,098
You are the one who is
too emotionally involved.

589
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:23,394
Okay, if this tumor had come
to you from any other doctor,

590
00:23:23,418 --> 00:23:24,778
you would still
be looking at it.

591
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,731
You are so worried about
your sister's outcome,

592
00:23:26,755 --> 00:23:29,590
you won't even think
about her patient's.

593
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:30,690
Am I wrong?

594
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:45,906
You have to try.

595
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,343
I am. I'm trying.

596
00:23:49,411 --> 00:23:52,090
We're supposed to focus on each
other and breathe, and you're not.

597
00:23:52,114 --> 00:23:53,831
I mean, your mind
is totally elsewhere.

598
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:57,500
So now you know my
every thought and intention?

599
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:09,563
We used to be able
to look at each other.

600
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,233
And I'd feel...

601
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:15,986
Like we were gonna be okay.

602
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,773
There is a reason
we're together, Owen.

603
00:24:19,842 --> 00:24:21,808
There is a reason we're married.

604
00:24:22,278 --> 00:24:23,810
Please.

605
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,045
Look at me.

606
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:33,089
All right. I'm looking at you.

607
00:24:34,656 --> 00:24:35,816
Right now.

608
00:24:36,843 --> 00:24:38,843
I'm looking right at you.

609
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:58,966
He has to stop holding a grudge.

610
00:25:00,983 --> 00:25:02,916
He has to see me for who I am.

611
00:25:02,985 --> 00:25:05,703
He has to take his
little list of all my crimes

612
00:25:05,771 --> 00:25:07,565
and rip it up, otherwise...
Otherwise what?

613
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:08,639
You know, I don't know.

614
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:13,143
How about you stop
thinking that you're the sun,

615
00:25:13,212 --> 00:25:15,545
and that I revolve around you,

616
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:18,165
and that being a cardio god,
maybe that isn't everything,

617
00:25:18,233 --> 00:25:21,901
and maybe what I need is
worthy of some consideration?

618
00:25:23,905 --> 00:25:25,805
And we're back to the abortion?

619
00:25:29,595 --> 00:25:31,662
Yeah. Yeah, we are.

620
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:40,053
I'm ready for the
transfer, Avery.

621
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:41,833
Dr. Sloan. Yes.

622
00:25:41,857 --> 00:25:43,752
You know that this
patient has a history

623
00:25:43,776 --> 00:25:45,587
of multiple
surgeries in that area.

624
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:46,877
She sure does.

625
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:48,785
Okay, then I don't
understand why you think

626
00:25:48,848 --> 00:25:51,125
it's a good idea to continue
to dissect right there.

627
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:54,117
Respectfully, Dr. Bailey,
it's not entirely important

628
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:57,220
that you understand everything
I do every step of the way.

629
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,606
No, respectfully,
Dr. Sloan, I disagree.

630
00:25:59,674 --> 00:26:01,219
I think it's
extremely important.

631
00:26:01,243 --> 00:26:04,762
Now if you had read the
file like you said you did,

632
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:07,748
you'd know that she'd
have massive scar tissue

633
00:26:07,817 --> 00:26:09,995
exactly in the area
that you're dissecting,

634
00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:13,153
so I think going forward
with that dissection

635
00:26:13,222 --> 00:26:15,366
is a monumentally
stupid course...

636
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,990
Respectfully, Dr. Bailey,

637
00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:19,626
the bulk of that scar tissue is
gonna be found near her axilla.

638
00:26:19,694 --> 00:26:22,345
So if Dr. Sloan continues
dissecting right there,

639
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,208
I really don't think
there'll be a problem.

640
00:26:24,232 --> 00:26:27,217
And I read that in the file,

641
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:30,370
the file that you... Carrie's file,
that you gave me to read, I...

642
00:26:31,474 --> 00:26:33,357
I did... I did read it.

643
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:39,930
Damn it. We've got
a big bleeder here.

644
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:41,615
Is that subclavian?

645
00:26:41,684 --> 00:26:45,652
Respectfully,
Doctors, I told you so.

646
00:26:48,874 --> 00:26:50,341
Okay, so I think it'll work.

647
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:52,020
If we cut down the
macerated part of the finger,

648
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:53,956
it'll be short, but it'll
still be salvageable.

649
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,079
Okay, but this thumb, I'm
gonna go ahead and say

650
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:58,331
that's not salvageable.
Yeah, you're done here.

651
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,233
He'll be better off
with a prosthetic.

652
00:27:00,302 --> 00:27:01,885
No.

653
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,332
The thumb is responsible
for 40% of hand function.

654
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:05,416
Without it, we're done.

655
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,141
But there's gotta
be something else.

656
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:09,826
I mean, I read
something about surgeons

657
00:27:09,895 --> 00:27:12,863
using a man's big toe as
a replacement for a thumb.

658
00:27:12,915 --> 00:27:14,781
Let's do that. Let's
use his big toe.

659
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:17,283
Listen, Dr. Frankenstein,
the big toe,

660
00:27:17,352 --> 00:27:20,482
it's pretty important,
you know, for walking.

661
00:27:20,506 --> 00:27:21,905
And he can learn to rebalance.

662
00:27:21,957 --> 00:27:23,185
Or he can keep
his toe where it is.

663
00:27:23,209 --> 00:27:25,259
This is a good
fix. I know it is.

664
00:27:25,327 --> 00:27:26,727
No, it's not.

665
00:27:27,696 --> 00:27:29,479
Dr. Torres, it has to be.

666
00:27:32,201 --> 00:27:34,084
The big toe is not the fix.

667
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,620
That is why we're gonna
use the second toe.

668
00:27:37,473 --> 00:27:39,050
It'll provide the same benefits,

669
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,585
but reduce potential disability.

670
00:27:40,609 --> 00:27:42,209
Really?

671
00:27:42,278 --> 00:27:45,878
Yeah, but we're not doing anything
without the patient's consent.

672
00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:56,739
All right. Tell me what
you're trying to do.

673
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:59,159
Uh...

674
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:01,089
I'm going in through the carotid

675
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:03,041
with two catheters,
one in the proximal...

676
00:28:03,065 --> 00:28:04,765
A carotid stick?

677
00:28:04,833 --> 00:28:06,278
That'll kill her even
faster. Damn it, Derek...

678
00:28:06,302 --> 00:28:08,045
Amy, I'm sorry,
but you can't stop

679
00:28:08,069 --> 00:28:10,069
and reestablish blood
flow in 90 seconds.

680
00:28:10,139 --> 00:28:11,733
I mean, I can't do
it in 90 seconds.

681
00:28:11,757 --> 00:28:14,641
Well, the great god of
neurosurgery has spoken...

682
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:16,654
Look, now I'm
trying to help you.

683
00:28:16,678 --> 00:28:19,774
But please don't put yourself
through this. You're too fragile.

684
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:21,231
I am not fragile.

685
00:28:22,268 --> 00:28:24,201
I'm a drug addict.

686
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,836
I've fallen off the wagon
twice, and I've gotten back on.

687
00:28:26,906 --> 00:28:28,689
That does not make
you fragile, Derek.

688
00:28:28,757 --> 00:28:30,457
That makes you
very freaking strong.

689
00:28:30,525 --> 00:28:34,344
I am standing in a building
full of pills right now,

690
00:28:34,413 --> 00:28:37,573
a fact that I am painfully
aware of, but I am doing this.

691
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:39,816
That is not fragile.

692
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:58,034
Okay.

693
00:28:58,104 --> 00:29:00,184
Show me what
you're trying to do.

694
00:29:00,756 --> 00:29:02,222
So you think there's a way?

695
00:29:03,225 --> 00:29:04,624
No, I don't.

696
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,960
But I can't stop you, so...

697
00:29:10,065 --> 00:29:12,265
I'll be here with you.

698
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:14,494
Show me what
you're trying to do.

699
00:29:26,832 --> 00:29:28,264
I was right.

700
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:30,734
Right?

701
00:29:30,803 --> 00:29:32,836
Too soon to tell.

702
00:29:32,905 --> 00:29:34,738
Cut the crap, Torres.

703
00:29:34,807 --> 00:29:36,740
You two are gonna put
a toe on a man's hand.

704
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:38,108
That was her idea.

705
00:29:38,844 --> 00:29:39,926
Maybe we are.

706
00:29:39,995 --> 00:29:42,312
His toe? Are you serious?

707
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:43,497
Maybe we're not.

708
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:45,832
Tommy, calm down.

709
00:29:45,901 --> 00:29:47,767
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to yell.

710
00:29:47,853 --> 00:29:48,919
It's just...

711
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:50,086
That's weird.

712
00:29:50,156 --> 00:29:51,455
Yeah.

713
00:29:51,524 --> 00:29:54,107
But if I say okay, I
get my hand back?

714
00:29:54,176 --> 00:29:55,554
Otherwise, you
fit me for a hook?

715
00:29:55,578 --> 00:29:57,543
A prosthetic, but if
you give the go-ahead...

716
00:29:57,612 --> 00:29:58,895
He gets a hand.

717
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:05,446
Well, what are you looking at
me for? Take my toe already.

718
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,938
Take my left nut if it'll help.

719
00:30:08,007 --> 00:30:09,906
I think the toe will be fine.

720
00:30:12,761 --> 00:30:14,261
I was right.

721
00:30:15,697 --> 00:30:17,097
So...

722
00:30:17,165 --> 00:30:18,376
This is how you're gonna
spend your time now,

723
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,611
pulling strings
behind the scenes

724
00:30:19,635 --> 00:30:21,446
like some kind of puppet master?

725
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:24,070
I am really good at it.

726
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,611
So I'm a 2-month-old baby.

727
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:32,679
Symptoms?

728
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,459
I'm underweight, fussy, I belch,

729
00:30:34,483 --> 00:30:36,160
and when I vomit,
it hits the ceiling.

730
00:30:36,184 --> 00:30:38,051
You have pyloric stenosis.

731
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,555
These cards are so
detailed. Whose are these?

732
00:30:41,624 --> 00:30:45,492
Uh, well, those would
be the smart one's.

733
00:30:45,561 --> 00:30:48,495
The only smart one.

734
00:30:48,564 --> 00:30:50,875
What the hell? What
happened to Morgan's baby?

735
00:30:50,899 --> 00:30:52,799
Wait. Morgan had her baby?

736
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:54,785
Oh, crap.

737
00:30:57,406 --> 00:30:58,688
One more clamp, please.

738
00:30:58,757 --> 00:31:00,851
Well, is it subclavian? Can
you get under the clavicle?

739
00:31:00,875 --> 00:31:02,392
Vascular clamp.

740
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:05,295
It's still oozing, Dr. Avery.
How do you want to proceed?

741
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,080
Um, I don't... I don't know.

742
00:31:07,148 --> 00:31:09,260
Oh, he did not just
say, "I don't know."

743
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,583
Man, tell me what you see.

744
00:31:10,652 --> 00:31:11,996
We're staring
straight at the defect.

745
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,347
You think we should
call in vascular?

746
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:15,739
No, no, I think we can
repair this ourselves.

747
00:31:15,808 --> 00:31:17,357
Maybe patch it? Stick tie.

748
00:31:17,425 --> 00:31:18,441
Patch it?

749
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,559
Yeah. Isn't that...

750
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:20,672
No, no, it's a good thought.

751
00:31:20,696 --> 00:31:22,028
Get on that. Bovie.

752
00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:26,049
Sorry, Dr. Sloan. Just
a little distracted here.

753
00:31:26,118 --> 00:31:29,085
Dr. Avery, let me give you
one small piece of advice.

754
00:31:30,155 --> 00:31:31,705
If there is anything,

755
00:31:31,773 --> 00:31:36,643
I mean anything, distracting
you from helping your patient,

756
00:31:36,712 --> 00:31:38,952
you need to leave it outside.

757
00:31:44,186 --> 00:31:45,935
Respectfully, I...

758
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:48,004
This is your patient now.

759
00:31:48,774 --> 00:31:50,407
Yours.

760
00:31:50,476 --> 00:31:52,319
Someone had better
tell me what is going on

761
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:53,588
and had better
tell me right now.

762
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:55,045
Dr. Bailey...

763
00:31:55,114 --> 00:31:56,612
You need to leave this OR.

764
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:58,248
Excuse me?

765
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:00,984
This patient, my patient,
developed a subclavian bleed

766
00:32:01,053 --> 00:32:02,864
because we misjudged
her adhesions.

767
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:04,866
But I am now doing
an arterioplasty,

768
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,368
which is not an
easy thing to do,

769
00:32:06,392 --> 00:32:09,743
and you are making it more
difficult by distracting me.

770
00:32:09,811 --> 00:32:11,355
You are compromising my ability

771
00:32:11,379 --> 00:32:12,857
to care for my
patient, Dr. Bailey.

772
00:32:12,881 --> 00:32:15,092
Well, if you're telling
me you can't focus in...

773
00:32:15,116 --> 00:32:17,734
I'm telling you you
need to get out.

774
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:19,786
Now.

775
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:23,322
Dr. Sloan, if you
let your resident

776
00:32:23,391 --> 00:32:25,608
speak to an
attending this way...

777
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:27,110
Dr. Bailey.

778
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,797
I believe Dr. Avery
made it very clear.

779
00:32:31,566 --> 00:32:33,749
Leave the OR

780
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:35,319
or I'll have you removed.

781
00:33:00,595 --> 00:33:02,896
Get out of the way! Move! Move!

782
00:33:05,968 --> 00:33:07,400
Damn it!

783
00:33:07,469 --> 00:33:08,646
Wait. Is that for
the Peterson baby?

784
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:09,848
For the mother. It's not good.

785
00:33:09,872 --> 00:33:11,471
All right. Get outta the way!

786
00:33:11,539 --> 00:33:13,306
Come on. Come on.

787
00:33:19,181 --> 00:33:20,313
Crap.

788
00:33:25,037 --> 00:33:26,620
What the hell happened?

789
00:33:26,688 --> 00:33:28,799
We were barely in the NICU
before he suffered an intestinal perf.

790
00:33:28,823 --> 00:33:31,423
Scrub in. I need
your extra hands.

791
00:33:32,094 --> 00:33:33,426
Uh...

792
00:33:33,495 --> 00:33:34,777
Give me a minute.

793
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:36,413
Hello?

794
00:33:36,482 --> 00:33:38,281
Yeah, this is Dr. Alex Karev.

795
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,650
I work with Morgan in Seattle.

796
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:42,619
Listen up, you're
fourth year, right?

797
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:44,328
Good. Listen up,
she's still in surgery,

798
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:46,000
but she's critical,
so's the baby.

799
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,957
You need to get on
a plane right now.

800
00:33:49,178 --> 00:33:52,062
Meredith and I do not
do everything together.

801
00:33:52,131 --> 00:33:53,513
The twisted sisters.

802
00:33:53,582 --> 00:33:55,510
Yeah, well, we're best
friends. What do you expect?

803
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:56,799
She has a baby.

804
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,496
Oh, my God. That
doesn't mean I have to.

805
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,131
I don't see why not. You
do everything else together.

806
00:34:00,155 --> 00:34:01,900
It's like you're a team.
Because she's my person.

807
00:34:01,924 --> 00:34:03,523
I should be your person!

808
00:34:03,592 --> 00:34:05,008
Be my person!

809
00:34:05,077 --> 00:34:08,160
Be my person, Owen!
Be my freaking person!

810
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:14,851
Be my person.

811
00:34:22,628 --> 00:34:23,727
He's dorsal dominant,

812
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:26,112
so I'm not going to
use a plantar incision

813
00:34:26,181 --> 00:34:27,898
to find the artery. Okay.

814
00:34:27,966 --> 00:34:30,516
And I have isolated
a good draining vein.

815
00:34:30,585 --> 00:34:31,918
Uh-huh.

816
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:34,086
Is that it? You're not
gonna ask me if I'm sure?

817
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,055
Are you sure?

818
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:37,624
Yes.

819
00:34:37,693 --> 00:34:39,075
Okay, then.

820
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:43,807
You're impressive.

821
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:47,133
I am.

822
00:34:47,202 --> 00:34:49,146
Look, there's always been a lot
of hype surrounding you, okay?

823
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,683
"Meredith Grey, ooh, child of
Ellis. Ooh! Isn't she so special?"

824
00:34:51,707 --> 00:34:53,723
You don't have to help
me if you don't want to.

825
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:56,793
No, no, no, that's not what
I'm saying. I'm saying...

826
00:34:57,896 --> 00:34:59,089
You're tougher than I thought.

827
00:34:59,113 --> 00:35:01,864
I'm saying you're smart. I'm...

828
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,601
Saying... Okay, look...

829
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:07,870
We've never been friends, not
even when I was with George.

830
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,250
Mainly because you thought I was

831
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:11,791
a freak and you're
blonde and very...

832
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:15,745
And now you have a
baby, and I have a baby,

833
00:35:15,814 --> 00:35:18,192
and we're both married, and...

834
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:20,096
I don't know. I'm
saying we're both alike.

835
00:35:22,303 --> 00:35:24,070
I'm saying I'll help you.

836
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,039
You're not a freak.

837
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:30,543
And we can be friends.

838
00:35:35,017 --> 00:35:36,927
Every morning, five days a week,

839
00:35:36,951 --> 00:35:38,846
you are in my
office at 4:00 a.m.

840
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,587
And we work, Grey.

841
00:35:40,655 --> 00:35:43,284
If you don't show up, if you
are late, I will kick your ass.

842
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:45,792
We work, Grey. We work.

843
00:35:45,861 --> 00:35:49,178
And you're gonna pass this
test. You're gonna pass it hard.

844
00:35:53,669 --> 00:35:55,268
Okay. We've got it threaded.

845
00:35:55,336 --> 00:35:59,238
We need to position the
balloons and then inflate.

846
00:35:59,307 --> 00:36:01,052
You need to get
yours in position faster.

847
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:02,420
I think you should
do it. You can do it.

848
00:36:02,444 --> 00:36:03,554
You just gotta
get in there faster.

849
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:06,396
Okay, ready? Inflate.

850
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:08,598
Starting the clock. Let's move.

851
00:36:10,451 --> 00:36:12,162
Mr. Price is awake
and responsive.

852
00:36:12,186 --> 00:36:13,864
And the rest of the
post-ops are done.

853
00:36:13,888 --> 00:36:15,065
What are you doing?

854
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:16,422
We needed two surgeons.

855
00:36:16,491 --> 00:36:19,158
One on the internal carotid,
the other on the external,

856
00:36:19,227 --> 00:36:21,828
controlling the balloons. We've
almost got it to 90 seconds.

857
00:36:21,897 --> 00:36:23,040
You think it's gonna work?

858
00:36:23,064 --> 00:36:24,642
Well, let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

859
00:36:24,666 --> 00:36:27,099
It's one step, one step of
a very complicated tumor.

860
00:36:27,168 --> 00:36:28,528
He doesn't think
it's gonna work.

861
00:36:28,569 --> 00:36:29,998
Well, we're gonna
go down trying.

862
00:36:30,022 --> 00:36:32,062
That's all. Thank
you. You can go.

863
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:40,847
I want to go down trying.

864
00:36:40,915 --> 00:36:42,309
All right. Pick
up the stopwatch.

865
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,383
Ready?

866
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:47,570
Hey, little boy.

867
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:50,373
I'm Dr. Robbins,
and this is Dr. Karev.

868
00:36:50,442 --> 00:36:52,486
You've got a long
road ahead of you,

869
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:55,010
but we're gonna do
everything we can to help you.

870
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:56,580
And your mom, too.

871
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:00,467
How's she doing?

872
00:37:01,269 --> 00:37:02,385
Morgan?

873
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:04,937
Um...

874
00:37:05,006 --> 00:37:06,172
I haven't checked.

875
00:37:11,746 --> 00:37:15,648
I ran a pregnant chick
all over the hospital today.

876
00:37:15,717 --> 00:37:18,284
Made her quiz me
on my stupid boards

877
00:37:18,353 --> 00:37:20,653
till she damn near died,

878
00:37:20,722 --> 00:37:23,640
and I haven't even checked
to see how she's doing.

879
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:25,725
Apparently, I'm the only
person in this hospital

880
00:37:25,794 --> 00:37:28,061
who didn't know
she was pregnant.

881
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:31,564
Because I'm too busy worrying
about my own stupid damn self

882
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:36,219
to even make an effort to
learn my interns' freaking names.

883
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:39,289
It doesn't matter if I
pass those boards or not,

884
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:41,708
I don't deserve that fellowship.

885
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:47,496
You know why I like you so much?

886
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:49,916
I honestly have no idea.

887
00:37:49,985 --> 00:37:51,784
You remind me of me.

888
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:54,821
Peds surgeons? We're vicious.

889
00:37:54,889 --> 00:37:58,107
We're the most hardcore
surgeons in the hospital.

890
00:37:58,176 --> 00:38:01,611
I mean, when I was
a resident, I was...

891
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,279
I was a full-on horror show.

892
00:38:03,348 --> 00:38:05,043
But that's what
it takes to learn

893
00:38:05,067 --> 00:38:07,187
how to save tiny
humans like this one.

894
00:38:07,853 --> 00:38:09,352
Yeah.

895
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,536
Yeah.

896
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:14,274
But do me a favor.

897
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:16,279
Learn your interns'
freaking names.

898
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:19,128
<i>We may not like it,</i>

899
00:38:19,197 --> 00:38:22,117
<i>but it really is important to
stop every once in a while,</i>

900
00:38:22,184 --> 00:38:24,918
<i>get out of your own head,
and see the bigger picture.</i>

901
00:38:24,986 --> 00:38:27,165
Dr. Sloan, I need a word
with you about Avery.

902
00:38:27,189 --> 00:38:29,255
Dr. Bailey, I have a patient.

903
00:38:29,825 --> 00:38:31,490
He was right.

904
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:34,294
Avery, he was... Was right.

905
00:38:34,362 --> 00:38:36,612
She's gonna be
able to use her arms.

906
00:38:37,099 --> 00:38:38,314
So...

907
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:41,333
Why did I say no?

908
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,642
You were being careful.

909
00:38:42,704 --> 00:38:44,114
Yeah, but she was
my prize patient.

910
00:38:44,138 --> 00:38:47,339
I've done groundbreaking
work on her behalf.

911
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:49,759
You were a resident like Avery.

912
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:52,812
You get more experience,
you get more conservative.

913
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,313
Conservative?

914
00:38:54,382 --> 00:38:57,517
Oh! Is that what
success buys you?

915
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:00,620
What, you get happy
and then you get scared?

916
00:39:00,688 --> 00:39:02,889
Don't want anything
in life to change?

917
00:39:02,958 --> 00:39:05,002
You're a grown-up.
You're risk-averse,

918
00:39:05,026 --> 00:39:08,094
'cause you know risk
has actual consequences.

919
00:39:08,162 --> 00:39:11,762
That's why we keep residents
around. They keep us fresh.

920
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:16,853
Are you telling me that
I'm not young anymore?

921
00:39:16,922 --> 00:39:19,122
I'm trying to tell
you you've arrived.

922
00:39:22,076 --> 00:39:23,292
Huh.

923
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,427
Oh.

924
00:39:26,264 --> 00:39:28,624
You pull that crap
in my OR again,

925
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:32,018
I'll report you to the board.

926
00:39:39,194 --> 00:39:40,726
<i>Actually,</i>

927
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:44,930
<i>finding out that you've been
looking at things all wrong,</i>

928
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
<i>can be sort of liberating.</i>

929
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:49,802
What happened?

930
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:54,957
You're fine.

931
00:39:55,026 --> 00:39:57,794
You know, Altman, she
did a kick-ass repair on you.

932
00:39:57,862 --> 00:39:59,128
My baby?

933
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:00,975
Where is my baby?

934
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:02,198
He's stable.

935
00:40:03,769 --> 00:40:05,668
Okay? I mean,
that's the first thing...

936
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:07,086
He?

937
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:08,538
Oh, yeah. That's...

938
00:40:08,607 --> 00:40:14,043
I guess the first thing,
he's a boy, and he's stable.

939
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:16,829
But?

940
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,282
He's intubated.

941
00:40:20,534 --> 00:40:24,270
We're giving him
indomethacin to treat his PDA.

942
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:29,058
And he had a spontaneous
intestinal perf that we fixed.

943
00:40:30,144 --> 00:40:32,778
Robbins, she's
observing him right now.

944
00:40:36,618 --> 00:40:40,453
Listen, Morgan, he's
doing great right now.

945
00:40:40,522 --> 00:40:43,506
And Robbins is watching
him, and, you know,

946
00:40:43,558 --> 00:40:45,158
when she leaves,
I'm gonna watch him,

947
00:40:45,226 --> 00:40:49,095
and, you know, I talked to Chris,
and he's on his way right now.

948
00:40:49,164 --> 00:40:50,263
Okay?

949
00:40:51,933 --> 00:40:53,099
Okay.

950
00:40:53,168 --> 00:40:55,735
So, you know, I thought
I'd just hang out here

951
00:40:55,803 --> 00:40:59,005
for a while with you, and, you
know, wait till Chris gets here.

952
00:40:59,073 --> 00:41:01,290
Leave it at that,
if that's okay.

953
00:41:03,912 --> 00:41:05,856
You're hanging out here because

954
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,297
it's quiet and
you need to study.

955
00:41:08,366 --> 00:41:10,066
What? No. No way.

956
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,501
You should.

957
00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:15,771
I would.

958
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:36,960
<i>And suddenly you
see new potential.</i>

959
00:41:39,564 --> 00:41:41,430
<i>New possibilities.</i>

960
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:44,600
Okay.

961
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:47,086
<i>Where you'd never
seen them before.</i>

962
00:41:47,155 --> 00:41:48,287
Done. Done.

963
00:41:50,358 --> 00:41:51,841
We have blood flow.

964
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:53,509
86 seconds.

965
00:41:53,578 --> 00:41:55,711
Call your patient.
Get her up here.

966
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:59,148
<i>And that's all fine when a hopeless
situation suddenly looks good.</i>

967
00:41:59,217 --> 00:42:00,850
<i>Unfortunately...</i>

968
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,662
I'm afraid our time is up.

969
00:42:15,834 --> 00:42:17,967
<i>Sometimes it goes the other way.</i>
