1
00:00:07,023 --> 00:00:08,149
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:08,358 --> 00:00:10,986
- Someone's down!
- We have to wait for a secure area.

3
00:00:11,194 --> 00:00:12,456
We should not be out here!

4
00:00:12,662 --> 00:00:15,460
I thought you smoothed things
between ER and paramedics?

5
00:00:15,665 --> 00:00:18,293
You're my new intern.
I just gave you an order.

6
00:00:18,501 --> 00:00:20,628
I wasn't aware Reece had
a hearing problem.

7
00:00:20,837 --> 00:00:21,997
My son is my business.

8
00:00:22,205 --> 00:00:26,039
And I'm not interested in continuing
as Interim Chief.

9
00:00:26,242 --> 00:00:27,072
Beard is stuck!

10
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:31,043
I wouldn't have asked if you had
told me what you were doing.

11
00:00:31,247 --> 00:00:33,807
Sorry you thought it was
your business to ask me.

12
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:36,817
Carter? What are you doing here?

13
00:01:05,548 --> 00:01:08,449
Hey! Morning, Carter.

14
00:01:08,918 --> 00:01:13,116
That's Grace Jones.
Hey, I didn't wake you up, did I?

15
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,052
I mean, you're on at 7.

16
00:01:15,258 --> 00:01:18,318
Yeah. But no problem.

17
00:01:18,528 --> 00:01:20,996
Good. You settling in down there?

18
00:01:21,197 --> 00:01:23,495
Yes, I like it.

19
00:01:26,236 --> 00:01:28,932
You have a very interesting
CD collection.

20
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:30,228
What?

21
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,568
I said, you have
a very eclectic CD collection!

22
00:01:34,144 --> 00:01:35,133
Thanks.

23
00:01:37,313 --> 00:01:39,406
Anything you want to listen to,
just ask.

24
00:01:39,616 --> 00:01:41,607
Don't ever touch it on your own,
though.

25
00:01:41,818 --> 00:01:46,414
I've rented to a lot of students,
so I had to make that a rule.

26
00:01:46,923 --> 00:01:49,858
Carter, let me make you one
of these, man.

27
00:01:50,059 --> 00:01:52,721
It'll slingshot you into your day.

28
00:01:53,563 --> 00:01:55,190
You're in a really good mood.

29
00:01:55,899 --> 00:02:00,268
I'm just so glad to be
100 percent focused on medicine.

30
00:02:02,238 --> 00:02:04,468
- Hey, can I ask you something?
- Sure.

31
00:02:05,008 --> 00:02:08,000
Do you find it easy to evaluate
other people's work?

32
00:02:08,645 --> 00:02:10,670
Time to grade your student?

33
00:02:11,481 --> 00:02:12,971
I worry about being too harsh.

34
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:16,044
Does she deserve to be judged harshly?

35
00:02:17,153 --> 00:02:18,745
I want to be fair.

36
00:02:19,355 --> 00:02:22,791
Lucy hasn't gotten off
to a great start this year, clearly.

37
00:02:23,493 --> 00:02:25,791
But she's smart and
she's willing to work hard.

38
00:02:25,995 --> 00:02:30,591
Maybe I should go easy, give her
a chance to turn things around.

39
00:02:33,837 --> 00:02:36,135
Go on. Keep talking.

40
00:02:41,811 --> 00:02:42,641
A stripper?

41
00:02:42,846 --> 00:02:46,942
I said, "Damn! Can't you cover that
up?" She was destroying the magic.

42
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,981
I thought I'd ride along this morning.

43
00:02:49,185 --> 00:02:51,346
It's more fun than the hospital,
isn't it?

44
00:02:51,554 --> 00:02:55,217
He likes it on the frontlines,
or we need closer supervision.

45
00:02:55,658 --> 00:02:58,821
- Somebody's gotta keep an eye on you.
- Hey, doc. Here!

46
00:03:00,997 --> 00:03:04,728
By the way, can I crash here tonight?
My building's being fumigated.

47
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,300
Have to ask the captain.
Shouldn't be a problem.

48
00:03:07,503 --> 00:03:09,937
You can sleep on a Barcalounger.
I've done that.

49
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,465
Who paged me?

50
00:03:12,675 --> 00:03:15,769
I got an 87-year-old man
with cholangitis for you.

51
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:19,813
I stopped taking admits at 6:30.
Why didn't you page the on-call team?

52
00:03:20,016 --> 00:03:24,680
He came in while you were on call.
Dr. Romano specifically asked for you.

53
00:03:24,921 --> 00:03:27,685
- How sick is he?
- He's septic, intubated...

54
00:03:27,891 --> 00:03:32,123
...hypotensive and in renal...
- No, no! This can't be happening.

55
00:03:32,328 --> 00:03:36,492
Look, I haven't had a nap in the last
24 hours. Rounds are starting.

56
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:38,599
I have to take a shower,
I smell bad.

57
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,928
And you give me a patient
sick as a dog?

58
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,104
What does that say?

59
00:03:42,338 --> 00:03:46,035
What does that say? 6:38!
I'm not on call!

60
00:03:47,043 --> 00:03:48,977
He's in Curtain 3.

61
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:54,143
We've all been there.

62
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,011
Shut up.

63
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:50,127
- Tony Broadway?
- That a great porn star name, or what?

64
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:54,003
- Carol, want to know your porno name?
- What?

65
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,474
Take your middle name
and the street you live on.

66
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:59,580
Like, mine would be Anthony Broadway.
Tony Broadway.

67
00:04:59,782 --> 00:05:02,615
You're mixed up. That's your
romance novelist's name.

68
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:05,185
- Excuse me?
- Your porno name is your pet name...

69
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:09,449
...with your mother's maiden name.
My name would be Nibbles McGee.

70
00:05:09,659 --> 00:05:11,422
Nibbles. That's a great porno name.

71
00:05:11,627 --> 00:05:15,119
Mine would be Fluffy Florez.
If you don't have a pet?

72
00:05:15,331 --> 00:05:17,663
- Use one you had as a kid.
- Nibbles is a great name.

73
00:05:17,867 --> 00:05:19,334
I don't think that's right.

74
00:05:19,535 --> 00:05:21,503
- What would yours be?
- Mine wouldn't work.

75
00:05:21,704 --> 00:05:24,468
Have we gotten a package
from Lakeside Supply?

76
00:05:24,674 --> 00:05:26,938
- This early?
- It's supposed to arrive overnight.

77
00:05:27,143 --> 00:05:28,303
Tell me when it's here.

78
00:05:28,511 --> 00:05:30,376
Kerry, have you got a minute?

79
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,014
We need to prepare
these Attending schedules.

80
00:05:33,216 --> 00:05:35,616
I'm not familiar with
the computer down here.

81
00:05:35,818 --> 00:05:39,310
It's a snap. Jerry can take
you through it.

82
00:05:39,522 --> 00:05:41,956
- Can you give me a hand?
- I got a lot of patients.

83
00:05:42,158 --> 00:05:45,127
Dr. Anspaugh, got a woman
complaining about her bill.

84
00:05:45,328 --> 00:05:47,262
She was charged for procedures
not done.

85
00:05:47,463 --> 00:05:48,828
Why are you telling me?

86
00:05:49,032 --> 00:05:51,398
Those calls go to
the Chief of Emergency.

87
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,501
Or the Interim Chief.

88
00:05:53,703 --> 00:05:57,730
Tell her you'll pull her chart
and call her within two days.

89
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:01,635
I don't know how I'm supposed
to learn in this environment.

90
00:06:01,844 --> 00:06:03,869
Our relationship has turned
adversarial...

91
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,412
...and it's not good for the patients.

92
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,743
Dr. Carter, we need to talk.

93
00:06:09,986 --> 00:06:12,284
Hey, Lucy. Is everything all right?

94
00:06:12,488 --> 00:06:14,718
You're talking to yourself.
Not a bad thing...

95
00:06:14,924 --> 00:06:18,792
Actually, do you think I should
sit down and talk to Dr. Carter?

96
00:06:18,995 --> 00:06:23,762
Depends on how direct you want to be.
You don't want to be confrontational.

97
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:26,161
- You don't want him to be defensive.
- Right.

98
00:06:26,369 --> 00:06:27,666
I'd do it over a meal.

99
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:31,431
Oh, like a chat. I like that.
Makes sense.

100
00:06:31,741 --> 00:06:33,538
Oh, damn!

101
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,499
Hey, Lucy?

102
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:38,343
Could you get me a tampon
from the thingy?

103
00:06:38,548 --> 00:06:40,448
Oh, I got one here.

104
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,049
Damn it.

105
00:06:43,453 --> 00:06:44,784
- There you go.
- Thanks a lot.

106
00:06:45,188 --> 00:06:46,314
Peter, sorry I'm late.

107
00:06:46,522 --> 00:06:49,047
I was in the ER with an admission
you need to see.

108
00:06:49,258 --> 00:06:51,021
- The problem?
- 87-year-old male...

109
00:06:51,227 --> 00:06:54,390
...septic, with cholangitis.
He's on mezlo and Flagyl.

110
00:06:54,597 --> 00:06:56,462
I got his pressure up with dopamine.

111
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,658
He's too sick for open surgery.
We'll do a decompression.

112
00:06:59,869 --> 00:07:02,269
- I booked the O.R.
- Busy night last night?

113
00:07:02,472 --> 00:07:06,408
Oh, God, horrible!
Twelve admissions, plus this one.

114
00:07:06,609 --> 00:07:10,045
I got an abdominal aortic aneurysm,
stab wound to the chest...

115
00:07:10,246 --> 00:07:14,012
...fall from a second-story balcony.
They just kept coming.

116
00:07:14,217 --> 00:07:16,651
I worked 36-hour shifts
as an intern in England.

117
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,185
This makes me realize
how long ago that was.

118
00:07:19,922 --> 00:07:22,948
I'll take him down,
and we'll round at 8, okay?

119
00:07:23,292 --> 00:07:27,786
Lovely. Gives me enough time
for prerounds...

120
00:07:28,397 --> 00:07:29,386
...and a shower.

121
00:07:30,266 --> 00:07:33,360
You know, I bumped into
David Kotlowitz an hour ago.

122
00:07:34,003 --> 00:07:35,265
He's a terrific ENT.

123
00:07:35,471 --> 00:07:37,996
He's done a lot of work
with cochlear implants.

124
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:40,737
Did you tell him about Reece?

125
00:07:41,477 --> 00:07:45,379
No, I just told him I had a friend
in need of talk on the subject.

126
00:07:45,581 --> 00:07:48,812
Don't solicit medical advice
on my behalf, all right?

127
00:07:49,118 --> 00:07:51,882
I worked with Kotlowitz.
That's why I brought it up.

128
00:07:52,088 --> 00:07:53,851
- Lf you'd rather I hadn't...
- Yeah.

129
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:55,785
Fine, forget about it.

130
00:07:59,595 --> 00:08:01,825
- What is that? A sternal saw?
- Yes, it is.

131
00:08:02,031 --> 00:08:05,125
- What's it doing here?
- My midline thoracotomy proposal...

132
00:08:05,334 --> 00:08:08,235
...sailed through
the Human Subjects Committee.

133
00:08:08,437 --> 00:08:09,426
Nobody told me.

134
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:12,904
Well, I'm certified to use it,
so we're up and running.

135
00:08:13,109 --> 00:08:15,634
I thought we'd talk
before it got underway.

136
00:08:15,845 --> 00:08:17,574
Surgeons use it on odd days...

137
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:21,978
...ER docs get it on evens.
Your turn's tomorrow.

138
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,546
Hey, bad news.

139
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,586
We're still not pregnant.

140
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,223
We'll redouble our efforts.

141
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,723
If it's more
than three times a week...

142
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:36,262
...we get diminishing returns.
Like reusing the same tea bag.

143
00:08:36,465 --> 00:08:39,696
- There's a romantic idea.
- Wasn't very romantic, was it?

144
00:08:39,902 --> 00:08:40,891
Doug?

145
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:44,937
I've got a lethargic infant
not eating. You better come see him.

146
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,771
- You okay?
- Yeah.

147
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:54,780
Baby's name is Sun? Korean?

148
00:08:54,984 --> 00:08:57,817
Actually, it's Sun.
His mom's a little different.

149
00:08:59,088 --> 00:09:02,717
All right, Mrs. Everly. I'm Dr. Ross.

150
00:09:02,925 --> 00:09:03,983
Can I take a look at Sun?

151
00:09:04,193 --> 00:09:06,423
I don't know what's wrong.
He won't nurse.

152
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,494
We'll figure it out.

153
00:09:08,698 --> 00:09:11,292
Hey, you his big sister?
What's your name?

154
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,900
- Sky. Hello, doctor.
- Well, hello, Sky.

155
00:09:14,103 --> 00:09:15,502
Sun and Sky, huh?

156
00:09:16,372 --> 00:09:17,930
He was fine until a few days ago.

157
00:09:18,574 --> 00:09:21,008
Then I noticed he wasn't nursing
so well.

158
00:09:21,711 --> 00:09:26,239
- Any solid foods or formula?
- Oh, no. Only my milk.

159
00:09:26,449 --> 00:09:28,508
My breasts are engorged
with him not eating.

160
00:09:28,718 --> 00:09:30,276
When was the last time he pooped?

161
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:34,752
- Oh, man. When?
- Yesterday morning.

162
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:40,454
- You sure?
- Yes, I haven't changed him since.

163
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,960
We'll hydrate him. Give him
50 cc's of D5 saline.

164
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,828
We'll have to do blood tests.

165
00:09:47,036 --> 00:09:49,766
And I need your consent
to do a spinal tap.

166
00:09:49,972 --> 00:09:52,964
You stick a needle into his spine?
Won't that hurt?

167
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,665
We'll sedate him, no pain.

168
00:09:54,877 --> 00:09:57,869
- Mom, it's gonna be okay.
- Do you think so, honey?

169
00:10:01,384 --> 00:10:02,783
We'll be right back, okay?

170
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,181
Get a CBC, Chem-20 and blood cultures.
Can you assist with the LP?

171
00:10:08,391 --> 00:10:09,824
Sure, how do you sedate him?

172
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,721
Propafol.
I'll get it from Pedes.

173
00:10:11,927 --> 00:10:14,555
General anesthesia?
Have we done that in the ER?

174
00:10:14,764 --> 00:10:18,461
First time for everything.
I'll take the proper precautions.

175
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:23,038
Yelling doesn't help!
There's an ambulance out front.

176
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:25,002
- Thank God!
- Don't open that door.

177
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,196
Get away from me!

178
00:10:26,409 --> 00:10:28,934
- Come on!
- Get away from me! Don't touch me!

179
00:10:29,145 --> 00:10:31,113
- Yes, hello.
- We got a 911 call.

180
00:10:31,314 --> 00:10:33,145
- I called.
- She shouldn't have called.

181
00:10:33,349 --> 00:10:34,179
Get in here!

182
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:37,875
- Where's the injured man?
- This is not an emergency.

183
00:10:38,087 --> 00:10:40,920
Everything's fine.
I don't need the hospital.

184
00:10:41,123 --> 00:10:42,784
- Your name?
- Richard Weingarten.

185
00:10:42,992 --> 00:10:46,052
He let this lunatic drill
a hole in his head.

186
00:10:46,262 --> 00:10:48,958
I'm an emergency physician.
Let me take a look.

187
00:10:49,165 --> 00:10:52,601
- I'm all right.
- Okay, just sit down here. Sit down.

188
00:10:52,802 --> 00:10:55,293
What are you ashamed of?

189
00:10:55,538 --> 00:10:57,802
- What happened?
- It's called trepanation.

190
00:10:58,007 --> 00:11:03,104
It's a centuries-old practice, a means
of increasing brain blood volume.

191
00:11:03,312 --> 00:11:06,042
- I had mine done in Amsterdam in 1968.
- Oh, God!

192
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:08,739
It was like God lifted
a weight from me.

193
00:11:08,951 --> 00:11:10,043
It's a surgical drill.

194
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,014
We're going to the hospital.

195
00:11:12,221 --> 00:11:16,248
You can't take me against my will.
I've studied this for years.

196
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:18,154
I didn't embark on it lightly.

197
00:11:18,361 --> 00:11:21,558
Let us at least put a bandage on
and get a blood pressure.

198
00:11:22,898 --> 00:11:26,698
Okay, sir, just sign this.
It says you refuse treatment.

199
00:11:26,902 --> 00:11:28,733
Go to the rig and get some saline.

200
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,736
- Come on, Rich. We did it.
- The Internet!

201
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,375
That's what started this whole thing!

202
00:11:34,577 --> 00:11:35,566
- Laura!
- I hate it!

203
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,575
- Get her outside.
- I hate it!

204
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,145
- What are you doing?
- Outside!

205
00:11:39,348 --> 00:11:41,213
- I don't want to go!
- Calm down!

206
00:11:41,417 --> 00:11:45,478
I'll have you brought up on charges.
I want to go back inside!

207
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,119
You're an intelligent person.

208
00:11:49,325 --> 00:11:51,384
I don't want to take you
against your will.

209
00:11:51,594 --> 00:11:52,583
I had to do something.

210
00:11:54,163 --> 00:11:55,653
All right. Okay.

211
00:11:57,433 --> 00:11:59,424
Doesn't look like you
penetrated the dura.

212
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:04,535
All I want to do is put a sterile
dressing on to clean the wound.

213
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,300
I'll leave you some saline
and gauze so you...

214
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,671
...or your friend, can keep it clean.

215
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:12,006
I forgot to bring any gauze.

216
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,916
I've held enough screaming
babies to know.

217
00:12:17,119 --> 00:12:18,381
They have to be sedated.

218
00:12:18,587 --> 00:12:19,576
Doug?

219
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,581
How you doing?

220
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,918
You can't administer propafol
to an infant.

221
00:12:24,126 --> 00:12:26,060
You've done it upstairs for 10 years.

222
00:12:26,262 --> 00:12:28,628
You're not an anesthesiologist.

223
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,594
I didn't think you'd have a problem.

224
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,791
Well, I do.

225
00:12:33,569 --> 00:12:36,663
I have him on a cardiac monitor,
pulse ox, dynamap...

226
00:12:36,872 --> 00:12:37,930
...and a crash cart.

227
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:41,371
You cannot just make up policy
as you go along.

228
00:12:41,577 --> 00:12:44,478
I'm trying to prevent pain,
do what's best for this boy.

229
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,844
If you want to discuss policy, leave.
We'll do it later.

230
00:12:49,485 --> 00:12:50,679
We will.

231
00:12:57,793 --> 00:13:00,353
Dr. Carter, want to grab lunch later?

232
00:13:00,563 --> 00:13:03,930
Let's see. Tell me about
this patient in Curtain 3.

233
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:06,601
Thirty-year-old male with pain
on urination.

234
00:13:06,802 --> 00:13:09,965
- The UA is negative for white cells.
- Chlamydia.

235
00:13:10,306 --> 00:13:11,295
Do a sexual history?

236
00:13:11,507 --> 00:13:14,169
He had two partners last year,
and used condoms.

237
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:17,504
So he claims. Send up a DNA probe
and treat empirically.

238
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:18,805
Treatment for chlamydia?

239
00:13:19,014 --> 00:13:21,778
Doxycycline BID,
or a dose of Zithromax.

240
00:13:21,984 --> 00:13:23,645
You should look at his chart...

241
00:13:23,853 --> 00:13:26,617
- Hi, I'm Dr. Carter.
- Hey.

242
00:13:26,822 --> 00:13:29,222
I need to ask,
do you always use condoms?

243
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:30,891
Pretty much, yeah.

244
00:13:31,093 --> 00:13:32,890
There's times where you haven't?

245
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,761
Once or twice maybe, yeah.

246
00:13:36,632 --> 00:13:39,465
That's all it takes.
We're gonna give you antibiotics.

247
00:13:39,668 --> 00:13:42,501
I think you have a common
infection called chlamydia.

248
00:13:42,705 --> 00:13:43,694
What, VD?

249
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,703
Sexually transmitted disease, yes.

250
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,239
She doesn't think so.

251
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:53,944
He also had conjunctivitis and
arthralgias at the knee and ankle.

252
00:13:57,453 --> 00:13:59,614
Mr. Bussey, excuse us for a moment.

253
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:03,349
He was in Mexico and had diarrhea.

254
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:06,289
The timing and symptoms
are classic for Reiter's.

255
00:14:06,495 --> 00:14:08,963
- You could've included that.
- You cut me off.

256
00:14:09,164 --> 00:14:11,962
- You could've said, "Reiter's."
- I didn't get a word in. You...

257
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:14,965
- I'm always doing what?
- Like now, you're defensive.

258
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:16,797
You don't even hear me.

259
00:14:19,808 --> 00:14:22,868
So, what's the treatment
for Reiter's Syndrome?

260
00:14:24,213 --> 00:14:25,305
Indomethacin.

261
00:14:26,048 --> 00:14:29,984
- We can still send off for chlamydia...
- No, you're right. It's Reiter's.

262
00:14:30,219 --> 00:14:31,914
Good pickup, Lucy.

263
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:38,720
Propafol is ideal for use in the ER.

264
00:14:38,928 --> 00:14:42,193
First of all, onset is immediate,
and it wears off in...

265
00:14:42,398 --> 00:14:45,026
Don't you think a doctor
should be trained?

266
00:14:45,234 --> 00:14:49,671
Got a gunshot to the chest coming.
The saw is sterilized in Trauma 1.

267
00:14:49,872 --> 00:14:52,363
We need to be ready
if this guy qualifies.

268
00:14:52,575 --> 00:14:55,305
You'll document 10 critical times.
Clock starts when?

269
00:14:55,511 --> 00:14:56,944
Soon as the patient enters.

270
00:14:57,146 --> 00:15:00,274
Don't they need to have
cardiac arrest? He sounded okay.

271
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,541
Patients can deteriorate en route.

272
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:04,981
Forty-six-year-old man shot
with a BB gun.

273
00:15:05,187 --> 00:15:07,052
- Hemodynamically stable.
- A BB gun?

274
00:15:07,256 --> 00:15:10,487
The punk who shot me needs to be
put under the jail.

275
00:15:10,693 --> 00:15:14,151
Ten years old or not.
Let me up off of this, I can walk.

276
00:15:14,363 --> 00:15:16,490
- Let him go.
- Doesn't need a thoracotomy.

277
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:21,432
- No, a tetanus shot and a Band-Aid.
- You can follow me, sir.

278
00:15:21,637 --> 00:15:25,403
- Want to turn around, or can we hang?
- No, take 10 minutes.

279
00:15:26,742 --> 00:15:29,540
Hey, Carol. What's going on?

280
00:15:30,446 --> 00:15:32,505
Just doing a quick blood draw.

281
00:15:32,781 --> 00:15:35,045
So how's the clinic going today?

282
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:39,380
Oh, I just love prenatal days.
Takes me back to my OB roots.

283
00:15:39,588 --> 00:15:41,283
Why don't you let a nurse do that?

284
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,521
Because I was trying to be discreet.

285
00:15:43,726 --> 00:15:46,752
Let me do it. It's kind of hard
to stick yourself.

286
00:15:46,962 --> 00:15:47,792
Thanks.

287
00:15:47,997 --> 00:15:49,692
What labs you need?

288
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:54,760
Just a CBC, check if I'm anemic.

289
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:57,302
Oh, I only ask
because if you'd like...

290
00:15:57,506 --> 00:16:01,567
...I can run the results through
the clinic. Be more private.

291
00:16:01,777 --> 00:16:02,766
That's a great idea.

292
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:08,414
What I'd really like is
to check my hormone levels.

293
00:16:08,617 --> 00:16:10,881
Oh, okay. Infertility workup?

294
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,180
- I don't want to discuss details.
- I wasn't trying to...

295
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,291
It'd be great if you
run it through the clinic.

296
00:16:17,493 --> 00:16:18,790
- Okay.
- Thanks.

297
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:32,500
Mark, glad I caught you.
I've had to move my surgical schedule.

298
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,801
Dr. Lee's interview is pushed to 1:30.

299
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,807
- Is that a problem?
- No, that's fine.

300
00:16:37,012 --> 00:16:39,412
- Have you looked at her CV?
- Impressive.

301
00:16:39,615 --> 00:16:43,051
If she's half as impressive in person,
she might be our next Chief.

302
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,844
And not a moment too soon.

303
00:16:45,054 --> 00:16:48,046
Dr. Greene, I didn't think you
were gonna be around.

304
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:52,557
I was on a paramedic ride-along,
and we brought in a patient.

305
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:56,219
So, you finish your student
evaluation yet?

306
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,263
I thought I had till the shift ends?

307
00:16:59,068 --> 00:17:01,195
No big deal, this afternoon's fine.

308
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,097
I wrote an evaluation for Lucy...

309
00:17:04,306 --> 00:17:07,036
...but I tore it up because
I want to be fair.

310
00:17:07,242 --> 00:17:10,109
You put something on paper
that'll impact her life.

311
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,311
Just evaluate her work.

312
00:17:14,983 --> 00:17:16,416
What are you talking about?

313
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,813
I'm talking about your porn-star name.

314
00:17:19,021 --> 00:17:22,422
Take your pet's name
and your mother's maiden name.

315
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:26,060
- Try it. Like mine is Rex Voytek.
- Oh, I know that game.

316
00:17:26,261 --> 00:17:28,058
But it's your drag name, not porn.

317
00:17:28,697 --> 00:17:30,927
- Drag name?
- Yeah, the name of your pet...

318
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:34,000
...and the street you're born on.
- I don't think so.

319
00:17:34,203 --> 00:17:36,171
RuPaul had it on her show.

320
00:17:36,505 --> 00:17:38,769
Leave some crumbs for the rest of us.

321
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:41,408
- Are you the cookie police?
- Have some...

322
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:43,840
...but I brought those for
the docs and nurses.

323
00:17:44,046 --> 00:17:46,514
- So you're the cookie fairy.
- Wait a minute.

324
00:17:46,715 --> 00:17:48,649
- Don't worry.
- Bad enough you raid...

325
00:17:48,851 --> 00:17:50,876
...the icebox, now you
want to call names?

326
00:17:51,086 --> 00:17:53,054
Conni, you begrudge us some juice?

327
00:17:53,255 --> 00:17:54,984
It's not like you bring anything in.

328
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:59,183
You should thank me for the cookie
I keep from your fat snack hole.

329
00:18:00,629 --> 00:18:02,221
You just keep talking, Morales.

330
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:06,366
- Hey, what's going on?
- That one's got a problem.

331
00:18:06,568 --> 00:18:09,036
- You antagonizing them?
- He called Yosh a fairy.

332
00:18:09,238 --> 00:18:12,207
I called him the cookie fairy.
It was a dumb joke.

333
00:18:12,407 --> 00:18:14,238
A real dumb joke.
Ready to head back?

334
00:18:14,443 --> 00:18:15,740
Yeah, let's go.

335
00:18:20,816 --> 00:18:23,046
I got no problem with him
being a bone-smoker.

336
00:18:23,252 --> 00:18:25,550
I was joking like I would
with anybody.

337
00:18:25,754 --> 00:18:27,449
Don't worry about it.

338
00:18:27,656 --> 00:18:29,556
Write the discharge orders soon.

339
00:18:29,758 --> 00:18:33,319
- Bed Control likes them by 12 noon.
- Yes, I am aware of that.

340
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,828
I told you I'd have a hard time
seeing you as my intern.

341
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,000
It's complicated for a lot of reasons.

342
00:18:39,234 --> 00:18:42,067
Dr. Corday, Mr. Frybush's
creatinine is much higher.

343
00:18:42,271 --> 00:18:44,432
Thank you.
Shall we call a renal consult?

344
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,267
Yeah, this guy needs dialysis.

345
00:18:46,475 --> 00:18:50,502
- So did you ever get that shower?
- No, can you tell?

346
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,805
Well, go ahead. I'll cover SICU.

347
00:18:53,015 --> 00:18:55,882
- I don't want special treatment.
- Turning down a shower?

348
00:18:56,084 --> 00:18:59,076
- I've got a lot of work.
- Okay, have it your way.

349
00:18:59,288 --> 00:19:02,382
Gotta go find Weaver.
She's itching to use that saw.

350
00:19:02,591 --> 00:19:04,889
Going to the roach coach.
Want something?

351
00:19:05,093 --> 00:19:08,290
Yes, a triple espresso.
Thank you, Kit.

352
00:19:08,497 --> 00:19:09,657
Elizabeth?

353
00:19:09,865 --> 00:19:13,232
How would you like to scrub in
on a bilateral adrenalectomy?

354
00:19:13,435 --> 00:19:17,337
Oh, I appreciate the offer,
but I'm postcall.

355
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:20,531
I gotta finish my work,
and I have to catch up on sleep.

356
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:23,006
A case like this comes
once in a blue moon.

357
00:19:23,212 --> 00:19:26,511
I'm up to my neck in ER garbage,
but I'm not passing this up.

358
00:19:27,449 --> 00:19:30,316
Well, it's been a while since
my last adrenalectomy.

359
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:32,248
I'll do right, you do left.

360
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:35,549
I can get Dr. Kennedy to cover
your service.

361
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:40,058
Jeanie? The baby's spinal tap
came back negative for meningitis.

362
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,456
What's going on?

363
00:19:41,663 --> 00:19:43,324
A lot. We got to talk to the mom.

364
00:19:43,532 --> 00:19:46,797
I'll take Sky out of the room.
She doesn't need to hear all this.

365
00:19:47,002 --> 00:19:48,026
Good idea.

366
00:19:48,237 --> 00:19:51,035
Her mom leans on her a lot,
don't you think?

367
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,674
- A smart kid, though.
- Yeah.

368
00:19:54,042 --> 00:19:55,839
Okay. Hey.

369
00:19:56,044 --> 00:19:58,638
- What did you find?
- Spinal tap was negative.

370
00:19:59,248 --> 00:20:03,309
I have more questions. Maybe
Jeanie and Sky could take a walk.

371
00:20:03,518 --> 00:20:05,884
I don't want to worry
about her wandering.

372
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,116
I'd rather stay here with Mom.

373
00:20:08,323 --> 00:20:11,451
Can she help me put
some toys away while you talk?

374
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,355
It's a good idea.

375
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,956
- Mind helping me?
- I don't mind.

376
00:20:16,164 --> 00:20:17,563
I'll be right back, Mom.

377
00:20:17,766 --> 00:20:19,791
- See what toys we can find.
- Sure.

378
00:20:20,569 --> 00:20:24,335
Okay, we need to see if
we can figure out...

379
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:26,234
...the cause of Sun's deterioration.

380
00:20:26,441 --> 00:20:29,638
- Now, has he had a polio vaccine?
- Oh, God, polio!

381
00:20:30,345 --> 00:20:32,506
He was vaccinated. Is that effective?

382
00:20:33,582 --> 00:20:34,913
Do you have a doll at home?

383
00:20:35,684 --> 00:20:37,481
- No.
- No, really?

384
00:20:38,253 --> 00:20:41,086
I had one. Dolls are for babies.
I'm a big girl.

385
00:20:42,524 --> 00:20:45,254
- And how old are you?
- Six.

386
00:20:46,028 --> 00:20:47,086
Six.

387
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:55,728
After the adrenal vein, we'll work
our way around the medial...

388
00:20:55,938 --> 00:20:58,031
...and inferior edges of the gland.

389
00:20:58,607 --> 00:21:01,542
Cut, please. And another tie.

390
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,145
Elizabeth, cut.

391
00:21:06,448 --> 00:21:08,075
Elizabeth?

392
00:21:09,084 --> 00:21:10,381
Sorry. Yes.

393
00:21:11,386 --> 00:21:13,946
You do need a rest.
Why don't you step out?

394
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,854
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

395
00:21:16,058 --> 00:21:17,423
Go take a nap.

396
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,952
Sorry I dragged you along.

397
00:21:24,967 --> 00:21:26,332
Dr. Goodman?

398
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,508
- Can I run something by you?
- Make it quick.

399
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,803
Male with aphasia and arm weakness.

400
00:21:37,012 --> 00:21:39,947
CT scan was normal.
Spinal fluid is clear.

401
00:21:40,148 --> 00:21:42,582
I'm thinking vasculitis or MS?

402
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:46,686
Send off a sed rate
and a complement level in the CSF.

403
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:50,255
Look at the differential. May be some
zebras you haven't considered.

404
00:21:50,459 --> 00:21:53,155
Okay. Hey, Yosh, is that
Lucy's palmtop?

405
00:21:53,362 --> 00:21:55,159
I love this. She let me borrow it.

406
00:21:55,364 --> 00:21:58,765
- Can I use it? When you're done.
- I'm done.

407
00:21:59,668 --> 00:22:01,067
Here you go.

408
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:05,262
- Know how to work it?
- Yeah, Lucy showed me once.

409
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:10,572
<i>I'd hoped to avoid this.</i>
<i>But things haven't improved.</i>

410
00:22:10,779 --> 00:22:15,216
<i>I don't know how I'm supposed to</i>
<i>learn in this hostile environment.</i>

411
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:18,248
<i>Our relationship has turned</i>
<i>completely adversarial...</i>

412
00:22:18,453 --> 00:22:20,944
<i>... and it's not good</i>
<i>for the patients.</i>

413
00:22:21,223 --> 00:22:22,747
<i>We need to talk.</i>

414
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:25,119
This crazy bastard lets Dr. Greene...

415
00:22:25,327 --> 00:22:27,420
...Iook inside the hole
with a penlight.

416
00:22:27,629 --> 00:22:29,893
- Unbelievable!
- I thought I'd seen it all.

417
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:32,191
Doc writes him a scrip
for antibiotics.

418
00:22:32,401 --> 00:22:33,800
The guy thanks us for coming.

419
00:22:34,002 --> 00:22:36,630
Yeah, I've got a way
with ranting lunatics.

420
00:22:36,838 --> 00:22:39,966
- I ain't kidding. You do.
- Hey, what's up, guys?

421
00:22:40,175 --> 00:22:42,370
- We're all here.
- You're not on today.

422
00:22:42,577 --> 00:22:45,375
Truth is, they're here because
we got you something.

423
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,669
You like it?

424
00:22:49,718 --> 00:22:52,516
- It's great.
- You're one of the gang now.

425
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,687
- Almost.
- Almost?

426
00:22:57,893 --> 00:22:59,622
There's something every
paramedic does.

427
00:22:59,828 --> 00:23:02,661
It's only appropriate
that you do too.

428
00:23:02,864 --> 00:23:07,494
How many patients have you brought in
strapped to a backboard with a collar?

429
00:23:07,702 --> 00:23:08,862
What do you have in mind?

430
00:23:09,071 --> 00:23:11,096
Come over to the table,
we'll show you.

431
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:14,935
As a part of our training,
we all get on the board ourselves.

432
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:16,610
You want me to lie on the board.

433
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,279
Don't worry. We all did it.

434
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,074
- Comes with the coat.
- Gotta drop your pants.

435
00:23:21,283 --> 00:23:23,148
No, he doesn't!

436
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:26,811
Forget about that part, guys.
All right? Forget it.

437
00:23:27,022 --> 00:23:29,013
I have to get back to the hospital.

438
00:23:29,224 --> 00:23:31,192
Then don't fight. Just lie down.

439
00:23:31,393 --> 00:23:32,917
- Come on.
- Relax, guys, back off.

440
00:23:33,128 --> 00:23:34,618
Let him do it on his own.

441
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,819
You want me to lie down.

442
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,895
- There.
- There you go.

443
00:23:41,103 --> 00:23:42,195
Get him!

444
00:23:42,404 --> 00:23:43,530
Got the shower on?

445
00:23:43,738 --> 00:23:47,572
- Come on, the shower's on!
- Get the shower!

446
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:52,210
Stop it! Stop it!

447
00:23:52,414 --> 00:23:53,711
Take it easy, doc.

448
00:23:53,915 --> 00:23:55,746
Hey, guys, guys. Come on.

449
00:23:55,951 --> 00:23:57,077
Let him up.

450
00:23:58,386 --> 00:24:01,878
- Let him up.
- We weren't gonna hurt you.

451
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:03,284
Much.

452
00:24:06,595 --> 00:24:08,495
It's all over for now.

453
00:24:14,269 --> 00:24:16,760
Jer, know what your name is
as a porn star?

454
00:24:16,972 --> 00:24:18,200
That game is tired.

455
00:24:18,406 --> 00:24:22,536
- I've got the best, Satan Monroe.
- Your mother's maiden name is Satan?

456
00:24:22,744 --> 00:24:25,508
- Carol, I need you.
- What's wrong?

457
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:29,241
Young woman complains of severe
right lower quadrant pain.

458
00:24:29,451 --> 00:24:31,510
Pregnancy test positive,
a possible ectopic.

459
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,709
- Name?
- Maria Jones.

460
00:24:32,921 --> 00:24:35,754
Five pregnancies.
Two live births, two abortions.

461
00:24:36,191 --> 00:24:37,385
Hi, Maria.

462
00:24:37,592 --> 00:24:38,854
We're gonna take care of you.

463
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,756
- It hurts, it hurts!
- All right.

464
00:24:43,098 --> 00:24:47,762
Let's get a CBC, Beta HCG, Chem-20.

465
00:24:48,537 --> 00:24:51,870
Type and cross two units,
and start a line of saline.

466
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:55,065
- Did you do a pelvic?
- No, she's in too much pain.

467
00:24:55,277 --> 00:24:58,303
She said I'm pregnant.
Is my baby okay?

468
00:24:58,513 --> 00:25:00,003
Okay.

469
00:25:01,183 --> 00:25:03,617
Let's do an ultrasound
while we're at it.

470
00:25:05,287 --> 00:25:07,847
It just hurts so bad!

471
00:25:08,056 --> 00:25:10,524
Okay, you're gonna be fine.

472
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,427
Sorry I'm late.

473
00:25:13,628 --> 00:25:18,031
We were just about to start
without you. Dr. Lee, Mark Greene.

474
00:25:18,233 --> 00:25:19,257
Sorry if I held things up.

475
00:25:19,467 --> 00:25:21,628
I'll try not to take it personally.

476
00:25:21,836 --> 00:25:24,862
You've been flexible with your time.
We appreciate it.

477
00:25:25,073 --> 00:25:27,837
- I'm happy to be here.
- Let's get right to it.

478
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,870
"Three years as associate chief.

479
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:35,106
Excellence in Clinical Teaching Award
two years in a row."

480
00:25:36,384 --> 00:25:38,852
How do you think you can improve
our department?

481
00:25:39,054 --> 00:25:43,115
You could benefit from an eight-bed
observation unit for 23-hour stays.

482
00:25:43,325 --> 00:25:45,953
Paid for how?
We're a cash-poor county hospital.

483
00:25:46,161 --> 00:25:49,858
- That's why you need it.
- Tell us more.

484
00:25:50,065 --> 00:25:51,794
I set up a unit like it in Atlanta.

485
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,869
And it saved the hospital $2 million
a year in unnecessary admissions.

486
00:25:57,072 --> 00:25:59,666
What kind of patients
are we talking about?

487
00:26:00,108 --> 00:26:02,406
- Lucy, take this.
- What is it?

488
00:26:02,611 --> 00:26:04,203
Your evaluation.

489
00:26:04,412 --> 00:26:05,401
It's blank.

490
00:26:05,614 --> 00:26:08,777
You fill it out since you think
I'm so adversarial.

491
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:12,317
And keep track of this
before someone walks away with it.

492
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,646
You listened to my notes?

493
00:26:13,855 --> 00:26:16,085
You're so sure I'd give you
a bad evaluation...

494
00:26:16,291 --> 00:26:19,419
...you're planning a countermove.
A hostile workplace?

495
00:26:19,628 --> 00:26:21,357
I didn't know it's time
for evaluation.

496
00:26:21,563 --> 00:26:23,861
Please. Why'd you want to have lunch?

497
00:26:24,065 --> 00:26:25,828
To get things out in the open.

498
00:26:26,034 --> 00:26:27,968
Well, they're out in the open.

499
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:32,606
Why don't you fill that out, and let's
see how fair-minded you can be.

500
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:39,803
- How long will they be upstairs?
- Not much longer.

501
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,040
What was the name of the doll you had?

502
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:45,048
- Baby.
- Was Baby a boy or a girl?

503
00:26:45,253 --> 00:26:46,948
She wasn't a boy or a girl.

504
00:26:47,155 --> 00:26:49,248
She didn't have a penis or a vagina.

505
00:26:53,094 --> 00:26:56,029
- What are you doing?
- Letting him lick the spoon.

506
00:26:57,399 --> 00:26:59,094
Does your brother lick the spoon?

507
00:26:59,301 --> 00:27:01,531
Sometimes, with things that he likes.

508
00:27:01,736 --> 00:27:04,261
- Like what? Yogurt?
- Sun doesn't like yogurt.

509
00:27:04,472 --> 00:27:06,940
- What does he like?
- Lots of things.

510
00:27:08,677 --> 00:27:09,666
Does he like honey?

511
00:27:11,179 --> 00:27:13,841
Your little brother licks honey
off of your spoon?

512
00:27:14,182 --> 00:27:16,582
- He likes it.
- Okay.

513
00:27:16,785 --> 00:27:19,310
Sky, let's go find your mom
and Dr. Ross, okay?

514
00:27:20,322 --> 00:27:21,311
Okay.

515
00:27:21,523 --> 00:27:23,991
- I like the observation unit idea.
- Good.

516
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,754
- Very good presentation.
- Thank you.

517
00:27:26,961 --> 00:27:29,191
I'd be happy to give you
a tour of the ER.

518
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:30,796
I don't need to be hand-held.

519
00:27:30,999 --> 00:27:32,762
But I do want to walk around.

520
00:27:32,967 --> 00:27:35,162
Feel free. I'll catch up with you.

521
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:36,735
It's a pleasure.

522
00:27:38,373 --> 00:27:41,968
- Mark, do you like her?
- She's good.

523
00:27:42,177 --> 00:27:44,737
You didn't say much.
Didn't think you're impressed.

524
00:27:44,946 --> 00:27:47,073
I'd like to continue this
in a less formal setting.

525
00:27:47,282 --> 00:27:49,079
I'll see if she can come for dinner.

526
00:27:49,284 --> 00:27:51,047
- Would you be...?
- I can't tonight.

527
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:54,221
I'm sorry. Excuse me, Dr. Anspaugh.

528
00:27:55,156 --> 00:27:57,317
- Are you feeling better?
- A little bit.

529
00:27:57,525 --> 00:27:59,516
Going to the bathroom helped, huh?

530
00:27:59,728 --> 00:28:01,286
Maybe it was just gas pains.

531
00:28:01,496 --> 00:28:03,862
You haven't had any bleeding,
which is good.

532
00:28:04,065 --> 00:28:08,126
You're further along than we thought.
Looks like 15 weeks.

533
00:28:08,336 --> 00:28:11,237
- I wasn't even sure I was pregnant.
- Look.

534
00:28:14,008 --> 00:28:16,533
Can you tell? Is it a boy or a girl?

535
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:21,313
Can't say for sure.
It looks like a girl.

536
00:28:21,516 --> 00:28:23,677
After having two boys, that'd be nice.

537
00:28:25,019 --> 00:28:26,543
Well, I don't see a penis.

538
00:28:26,755 --> 00:28:28,552
You can't always tell
on an ultrasound.

539
00:28:28,757 --> 00:28:30,486
You'll have to come back...

540
00:28:30,692 --> 00:28:32,819
...make sure she stays healthy.

541
00:28:33,261 --> 00:28:34,523
I'll do that.

542
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,394
Come on, Corday.

543
00:28:43,838 --> 00:28:45,499
Pull yourself together.

544
00:28:45,707 --> 00:28:48,232
It's just a few more hours to go.

545
00:29:02,924 --> 00:29:04,448
Elizabeth, can you do me a favor?

546
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:07,150
Watch the service?
I've gotta see Dr. Kotlowitz.

547
00:29:07,362 --> 00:29:09,922
- Really?
- Yeah, I ran into him.

548
00:29:10,532 --> 00:29:12,397
Actually, I went looking for him.

549
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,534
Peter, that's terrific. Yes, go!

550
00:29:14,736 --> 00:29:17,432
- I can cover service.
- Thanks.

551
00:29:22,544 --> 00:29:24,478
I need orders on a new admission.

552
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:26,169
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

553
00:29:26,381 --> 00:29:30,215
- No, Mr. Ramos is back.
- Ramos? Fem-pop bypass?

554
00:29:30,418 --> 00:29:31,646
I discharged him yesterday.

555
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,816
He's back with an infection
and an asthma attack.

556
00:29:35,423 --> 00:29:37,823
- You know the rules.
- Yep, I know. He's mine.

557
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:40,153
He's on continuous albuterol.

558
00:29:41,329 --> 00:29:43,194
Hello, Mr. Ramos.

559
00:29:43,398 --> 00:29:45,593
Let's take a look at your legs.

560
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,631
I was hoping you'd be here today.

561
00:29:48,336 --> 00:29:51,100
Oh, where else would I possibly go?

562
00:29:51,806 --> 00:29:54,172
I asked the mom if she'd given
the baby food.

563
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:55,899
Guess I talked to the wrong person.

564
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:58,374
The baby's lucky.
We can treat botulism.

565
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,946
- But what do we do to help Sky?
- She's fine.

566
00:30:01,149 --> 00:30:02,673
Her mom's draining her childhood.

567
00:30:02,917 --> 00:30:06,683
As much neglect and abuse as I see,
trust me, Sky is okay.

568
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:10,551
- She needs to be a little girl.
- Yeah, that's true.

569
00:30:10,758 --> 00:30:14,455
Hey, guys. Okay, now...

570
00:30:15,129 --> 00:30:17,029
...you can't give honey
to your brother...

571
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,962
...or to any baby
because it can hurt them.

572
00:30:20,168 --> 00:30:21,931
Honey can have botulism spores.

573
00:30:22,136 --> 00:30:26,197
Their intestines are immature,
and they can't kill off the spores.

574
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:28,534
He's maxed out with a pressure of 65.

575
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:32,702
Systemic resistance is 3500.
Let's start Levophed.

576
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:36,008
Dr. Corday, I need you here.
Mr. Ramos is pretty tight.

577
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:38,912
You okay?

578
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,247
Yep, I'm fine.

579
00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:46,459
- How much albuterol?
- Twenty an hour.

580
00:30:46,661 --> 00:30:49,528
- He's had Solu-Medrol.
- 125 in the ER.

581
00:30:49,731 --> 00:30:52,393
- Okay, I'll push some magnesium.
- Magnesium?

582
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,933
It relaxes the smooth muscles
of the bronchioles.

583
00:30:56,137 --> 00:30:57,627
Can you look at Mr. Frybush?

584
00:30:57,839 --> 00:30:59,739
Give me five minutes, okay?

585
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:02,273
Carter, can you explain
this evaluation?

586
00:31:02,477 --> 00:31:04,741
If it's this bad,
you should've come to me.

587
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,538
Do you have something against her?

588
00:31:06,748 --> 00:31:09,114
- Wait a sec...
- I want to see you and Lucy.

589
00:31:09,317 --> 00:31:12,115
We're gonna figure this out.
Find her and then me.

590
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,345
- Can I hang on to that?
- No!

591
00:31:16,824 --> 00:31:18,485
Sound like you're in a good mood.

592
00:31:18,693 --> 00:31:21,025
Do me a favor?
I need a place to crash.

593
00:31:21,229 --> 00:31:23,356
Building's being fumigated.
Would Carol mind?

594
00:31:23,565 --> 00:31:26,090
- You kidding? Come over.
- Save me a few bucks.

595
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,735
- Sure thing, glad to have you.
- Thanks.

596
00:31:28,937 --> 00:31:32,202
He's set up for another
four hours of continuous.

597
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:36,176
Magnesium's on board.

598
00:31:36,544 --> 00:31:39,308
- How are you feeling, Mr. Ramos?
- Dizzy.

599
00:31:39,514 --> 00:31:42,415
- Whoa. What's happening?
- Maybe he's hypoxic.

600
00:31:42,617 --> 00:31:46,212
- How much mag did you give him?
- Two grams IV push, 40 cc's.

601
00:31:46,421 --> 00:31:48,048
Forty cc's of 50 percent mag?

602
00:31:48,256 --> 00:31:50,087
Not 50 percent! Five percent!

603
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:52,452
No, Dr. Corday,
you gave him 50 percent.

604
00:31:54,028 --> 00:31:56,622
My God, you're right.
I gave him a lethal dose.

605
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:58,662
- He's not breathing.
- ET tube!

606
00:31:58,866 --> 00:32:00,390
Bradying down. Heart rate's 30.

607
00:32:00,602 --> 00:32:03,867
Two grams calcium gluconate.
Push an amp of atropine.

608
00:32:06,541 --> 00:32:08,805
Bag him, prep for IJ.
I'll float a pacemaker.

609
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,672
- Lost the pulse, in P.E.A.
- I'll start compressions.

610
00:32:11,879 --> 00:32:15,440
Seven and a half gloves and
8 French Cordis introducer.

611
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:24,355
The cochlear implant is a miracle,
and the technology keeps improving.

612
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:25,924
I'm impressed by what I read.

613
00:32:26,127 --> 00:32:28,152
Don't read.
Talk to people who have it.

614
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:29,694
Talk to parents of kids...

615
00:32:29,897 --> 00:32:33,162
I can get you in touch with people
who faced the same.

616
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:37,270
Great, I've already heard
an earful from the opponents, so...

617
00:32:37,472 --> 00:32:38,803
The fanatics.

618
00:32:39,007 --> 00:32:40,634
Well, they've got their agendas.

619
00:32:40,842 --> 00:32:45,142
The level of passion with which
these people attack you, it's bizarre.

620
00:32:45,346 --> 00:32:50,010
Someone used the word "genocidal."
Said I was eradicating deaf culture.

621
00:32:50,351 --> 00:32:52,512
Deafness is not
an alternative lifestyle.

622
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,086
People who claim it is
are beyond reasoning with.

623
00:32:55,289 --> 00:32:56,984
The thing I figure is...

624
00:32:57,191 --> 00:33:00,092
...why make an argument against
hearing and speaking?

625
00:33:00,294 --> 00:33:04,287
Honestly, know what I think?
I think it comes down to laziness.

626
00:33:04,499 --> 00:33:06,296
A deaf person can function.

627
00:33:06,501 --> 00:33:08,696
But some people don't want
to exercise...

628
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:10,837
...and do all the drills it takes.

629
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,234
Look, it's years of hard work.

630
00:33:13,441 --> 00:33:15,875
Yeah, but they have the energy
to attack me.

631
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,602
The hell with them.
Don't stand in my way...

632
00:33:18,813 --> 00:33:20,940
...when I'm trying to help a person
function.

633
00:33:22,884 --> 00:33:25,079
Why don't you tell me
how you really feel?

634
00:33:27,055 --> 00:33:31,754
Anyway, you bring in your son
and we'll see if he's a candidate.

635
00:33:33,027 --> 00:33:35,757
Do you work closely with Dr. Corday?

636
00:33:36,297 --> 00:33:38,231
Actually, she's my intern.

637
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:41,163
She told me about the fallout
with Rocket Romano.

638
00:33:41,369 --> 00:33:42,358
Oh, yeah.

639
00:33:43,004 --> 00:33:45,131
Do you know if she's seeing anybody?

640
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:47,206
I'm just wondering.

641
00:33:47,742 --> 00:33:50,540
I'm pretty sure
she's involved with somebody.

642
00:33:50,745 --> 00:33:52,212
- I'm not surprised.
- Yeah.

643
00:33:52,413 --> 00:33:53,573
- Oh, well.
- Thanks.

644
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:56,045
You bet, anytime. Give me a call.

645
00:33:57,852 --> 00:33:58,841
Check, please.

646
00:34:00,154 --> 00:34:01,678
Systolic, 60 palp.

647
00:34:01,889 --> 00:34:05,154
Come on. Come on. Come on.

648
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:09,626
We've got capture.
Turning the rate down to 80.

649
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,432
- Did you page Dr. Benton?
- Done.

650
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:13,964
- Pulse is stronger.
- Good.

651
00:34:14,168 --> 00:34:16,432
Pupils are fixed and dilated.

652
00:34:16,838 --> 00:34:18,169
That could be the atropine.

653
00:34:18,372 --> 00:34:20,203
That, or he stroked out.
What happened?

654
00:34:20,408 --> 00:34:23,571
I gave him enough magnesium
to cause a cardiac arrest.

655
00:34:23,778 --> 00:34:26,042
- Twenty grams.
- Oh, no.

656
00:34:26,247 --> 00:34:29,580
I looked at the label.
I thought it said 5 percent...

657
00:34:29,784 --> 00:34:33,311
...but it was 50 percent.
But I looked at the label.

658
00:34:35,223 --> 00:34:37,783
- I got your blood work back.
- Thanks, Lynette.

659
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:41,428
Progesterone level's normal.
That's good news, you ovulated.

660
00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:44,427
I've been trying to get pregnant,
and I haven't.

661
00:34:44,632 --> 00:34:46,862
- How long have you been at it?
- Couple months.

662
00:34:47,068 --> 00:34:49,002
Give yourself at least six months...

663
00:34:49,203 --> 00:34:50,830
...before you start worrying.

664
00:34:51,038 --> 00:34:52,596
Yeah, you're right. I'm crazy.

665
00:34:52,807 --> 00:34:55,503
Maybe you guys need to increase
your activity.

666
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,940
How often do you, you know, do the do?

667
00:34:58,146 --> 00:35:01,138
- What?
- Oh, sorry, am I being indiscreet?

668
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:02,671
Carol, what's the deal?

669
00:35:02,884 --> 00:35:06,012
I went to see your ectopic.
She's dressed, ready to leave.

670
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:08,745
- Maria Jones?
- She pulled her IV?

671
00:35:09,557 --> 00:35:11,286
Maria, where are you going?

672
00:35:11,492 --> 00:35:12,982
I feel better. I'm going home.

673
00:35:13,227 --> 00:35:16,196
You were in so much pain,
I couldn't examine you.

674
00:35:16,397 --> 00:35:18,627
- But I'm better now.
- But, wait.

675
00:35:18,833 --> 00:35:21,301
We need to make sure
everything's okay with you.

676
00:35:21,502 --> 00:35:23,561
Just let the doctor look you over.

677
00:35:23,771 --> 00:35:26,740
Look, I just wanted to know
if it was a boy or a girl.

678
00:35:26,941 --> 00:35:28,306
Nothing's wrong, so why worry?

679
00:35:28,509 --> 00:35:31,535
Wait! You were faking those
abdominal pains?

680
00:35:31,746 --> 00:35:34,738
- Are you crazy?
- You weren't sure you were pregnant.

681
00:35:34,949 --> 00:35:37,247
Why would you lie and cause
all that drama...

682
00:35:37,451 --> 00:35:39,749
...to find out if it's a boy or a...?

683
00:35:39,954 --> 00:35:42,616
- No, are you gonna abort this baby?
- Let go of me!

684
00:35:42,824 --> 00:35:45,349
- Carol!
- She's had two boys and two abortions.

685
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,959
Are you getting rid of this child...?

686
00:35:47,161 --> 00:35:48,890
It's my baby and I'll do what I want.

687
00:35:49,096 --> 00:35:52,532
I told you that ultrasound
is inconclusive. It could be a boy!

688
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:54,758
Lady, take your hands off of me.

689
00:35:54,969 --> 00:35:56,231
Carol, let her go.

690
00:35:56,437 --> 00:35:58,132
Girls are trouble anyhow.

691
00:35:58,339 --> 00:36:01,502
What's the matter with you?
What's the matter with you?!

692
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:14,786
How could you inject a patient
with 20 grams of magnesium?

693
00:36:14,989 --> 00:36:17,321
I make no excuses.
It was a grievous error.

694
00:36:18,526 --> 00:36:20,960
Where were you during this,
Dr. Benton?

695
00:36:21,162 --> 00:36:24,188
I was out of the hospital.
I came when I was paged.

696
00:36:24,398 --> 00:36:26,263
It wouldn't have mattered, anyway.

697
00:36:26,467 --> 00:36:28,901
You left your intern unsupervised.

698
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:31,571
This patient may have suffered
brain injury.

699
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:32,761
I stopped by the unit.

700
00:36:32,974 --> 00:36:35,272
Mr. Ramos' eyes are open,
and he's responding.

701
00:36:35,476 --> 00:36:37,341
You are not to leave while on duty.

702
00:36:37,545 --> 00:36:39,911
You are not to leave
your intern unsupervised.

703
00:36:41,148 --> 00:36:44,515
I know it's hard for us all to view
Elizabeth as an intern.

704
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:48,246
But we've opened up this hospital
to enormous liability.

705
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:55,660
I'll speak to Risk Management
and the hospital attorneys.

706
00:36:55,863 --> 00:36:59,299
They'll determine what information
to release to the families.

707
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:03,604
Don't either of you discuss
this with anyone.

708
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:12,170
Can we get together
and not talk about this?

709
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:15,076
I have to pick up my son
from my sister's house.

710
00:37:15,283 --> 00:37:16,648
All right.

711
00:37:20,121 --> 00:37:22,248
You just need to get
a good night's sleep.

712
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,267
I didn't fill this out.

713
00:37:34,468 --> 00:37:35,457
- Who did?
- She did.

714
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,501
- Why did she?
- Because he told me to.

715
00:37:37,705 --> 00:37:40,503
I didn't say to give it to him,
I said to give it to me.

716
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:42,676
- No, you didn't.
- Okay, wait.

717
00:37:43,277 --> 00:37:44,972
Don't talk to each other, talk to me.

718
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:48,410
Mark, I wanted to know
how she thought she was doing...

719
00:37:49,383 --> 00:37:50,577
...before my final assessment.

720
00:37:50,785 --> 00:37:52,309
I tried to put myself
in his shoes...

721
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,852
...and be critical.
He said, "fill it out"...

722
00:37:55,056 --> 00:37:57,923
...meaning "turn it in."
- How could she assume that?

723
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:00,160
Makes no sense.

724
00:38:00,394 --> 00:38:03,056
That's part of his problem.
Incomplete directions.

725
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,731
I give incomplete directions?

726
00:38:04,932 --> 00:38:06,422
- Name a time.
- Just one?

727
00:38:06,634 --> 00:38:08,761
Tell her to name a time
when I gave her...

728
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:12,531
...incomplete directions.
- Okay, talk to each other.

729
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:16,039
Don't talk to me.
Whatever this is, I can't fix it.

730
00:38:16,243 --> 00:38:18,837
Work it out, both of you.

731
00:38:21,949 --> 00:38:24,975
Kerry, I need to talk to you
about the x-ray report.

732
00:38:25,186 --> 00:38:26,414
Please don't blow me off.

733
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,848
Sorry, trauma coming in.

734
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:30,216
Possible candidate
for the thoracotomy study.

735
00:38:30,424 --> 00:38:31,584
I didn't know that's running.

736
00:38:31,792 --> 00:38:34,454
Stab wound to left chest.
Had a pulse in the field.

737
00:38:34,662 --> 00:38:37,825
Gave him epi, 1500 cc's of saline.
Shocked him twice.

738
00:38:38,032 --> 00:38:39,556
Great candidate. The stopwatch?

739
00:38:39,767 --> 00:38:40,961
Right here.

740
00:38:41,202 --> 00:38:42,191
You mind if I tag along?

741
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:46,033
Now, start the timer. Here we go.

742
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,303
On my count: One, two, three!

743
00:38:50,511 --> 00:38:52,274
Two units of O-neg on the infuser.

744
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,506
Get type-specific as soon as you can.
Ten blade, let's go.

745
00:38:55,716 --> 00:38:57,581
Good breath sounds bilaterally.

746
00:38:57,785 --> 00:38:59,582
Seven and a half gloves.

747
00:39:01,889 --> 00:39:06,258
Okay, skin incision is complete.

748
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,991
Mark the time. Saw, please.

749
00:39:24,512 --> 00:39:26,776
- Sternal retractor.
- Good job!

750
00:39:26,981 --> 00:39:29,449
- I need a purple top.
- Pulse ox 85.

751
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:32,118
- Mark the time.
- Suction, please.

752
00:39:32,319 --> 00:39:35,948
Pickups and Metz.
Looks like blood in the pericardium.

753
00:39:36,157 --> 00:39:37,749
First hemoglobin is 9.2.

754
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:40,290
Okay, pericardium is open.
Mark the time.

755
00:39:41,195 --> 00:39:43,186
I see a stab wound
to the left ventricle.

756
00:39:43,397 --> 00:39:45,524
- What are we at?
- Forty-two seconds.

757
00:39:45,733 --> 00:39:47,701
Take over internal compressions.

758
00:39:47,902 --> 00:39:49,460
Tamponade the wound. 2-O silk.

759
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:51,535
One horizontal mattress should do it.

760
00:39:51,739 --> 00:39:55,140
- Two units are in.
- Hang another two. How's the heart?

761
00:39:56,077 --> 00:39:58,807
- Starting to fill.
- Get the paddles ready.

762
00:39:59,013 --> 00:40:02,813
Okay, cardiac injury is repaired.
Mark the time.

763
00:40:03,017 --> 00:40:06,111
- V-fib.
- Charging to 20 and clear.

764
00:40:08,589 --> 00:40:12,047
- Sinus rhythm.
- Cardiac activity restored, mark time.

765
00:40:12,259 --> 00:40:14,819
- I've got a pulse.
- Excellent job, Kerry.

766
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:31,009
Dr. Greene.

767
00:40:31,312 --> 00:40:33,303
Dr. Lee. Finding your way around?

768
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:36,278
Yes, thanks. I wanted to ask you.

769
00:40:36,484 --> 00:40:39,146
I didn't feel I connected with you
at my interview.

770
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:41,548
- Is that a correct assessment?
- How do you mean?

771
00:40:42,556 --> 00:40:45,423
I'd look over and wonder,
"Am I making my best case?"

772
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,618
It was a good interview...

773
00:40:47,828 --> 00:40:49,819
I like this department
and I want this job.

774
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,760
I'm one of the baddest ER bitches
out there.

775
00:40:53,634 --> 00:40:57,468
If I didn't make my best case before,
I'd like to try again now.

776
00:40:57,671 --> 00:40:59,104
Can I grab a soda and sit with you?

777
00:41:00,441 --> 00:41:01,965
Yeah, sure.

778
00:41:02,343 --> 00:41:04,436
Call me when he's in Recovery.

779
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:13,380
- Don, I have something to confess.
- Oh?

780
00:41:13,587 --> 00:41:17,148
For a while I felt resentment
when it became clear...

781
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:21,158
...I wasn't your choice to run
the Emergency Department full-time.

782
00:41:21,362 --> 00:41:24,695
- It's not that you weren't qualified...
- Hold on.

783
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:29,598
Now I am so grateful to be putting
all of myself into medicine.

784
00:41:29,803 --> 00:41:34,240
And I want you to know there are
no lingering hard feelings on my part.

785
00:41:34,441 --> 00:41:37,808
Well, I must say I could sense
the bad feelings.

786
00:41:38,145 --> 00:41:43,082
I did wish there was something I could
do because I value your friendship.

787
00:41:43,284 --> 00:41:45,149
Well, how's the job search going?

788
00:41:45,352 --> 00:41:48,788
We interviewed a wonderful woman.
Amanda Lee, out of Atlanta.

789
00:41:48,989 --> 00:41:51,184
- I don't know her.
- Join us for dinner?

790
00:41:51,392 --> 00:41:52,950
I'd love to hear what you think.

791
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:56,596
Don, I'm trying.
But I'm not all the way there yet.

792
00:41:57,665 --> 00:41:58,825
Thanks.

793
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:03,331
Isn't it weird living with your boss?

794
00:42:03,537 --> 00:42:05,971
No, we get along okay.
Plus, it's a bargain.

795
00:42:06,173 --> 00:42:09,301
All I have to do is some yard work,
clean the gutters.

796
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:11,705
Do the stuff that she can't handle.

797
00:42:15,649 --> 00:42:18,311
Roxanne, if you make me forget
this day...

798
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:21,977
...I will owe you the biggest favor.
- Lousy day, huh?

799
00:42:22,189 --> 00:42:26,626
- My med student is driving me crazy.
- Lucy.

800
00:42:27,761 --> 00:42:29,786
There's so much I want to teach her.

801
00:42:29,997 --> 00:42:31,555
And it's just not happening.

802
00:42:31,765 --> 00:42:33,289
I don't think I'm a bad teacher.

803
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,058
I don't think she's a bad student.

804
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:39,697
You know what?
I can say one good thing about Lucy.

805
00:42:39,907 --> 00:42:41,602
She's not here.

806
00:42:42,676 --> 00:42:44,735
Oh, you make a good point.

807
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:54,116
- Didn't mean to put you to work.
- Don't be silly. It's gonna be nice.

808
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:11,027
- Want some more?
- No, no.

809
00:43:11,238 --> 00:43:12,705
It was good, though.

810
00:43:12,906 --> 00:43:16,808
Hey, who's making all that noise?
What's up, man?

811
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:19,275
Come on.
Let's get ready to go, huh?

812
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,471
Come on, say goodbye to Aunt Jackie.

813
00:43:21,715 --> 00:43:23,876
Jackie, who gave him this phone?

814
00:43:24,084 --> 00:43:27,850
Oh, it's a toy, Peter.
It's a cute shape, and he likes it.

815
00:43:28,055 --> 00:43:30,114
He probably saw you on it all day.

816
00:43:30,324 --> 00:43:31,416
Hey, hey!

817
00:43:31,625 --> 00:43:35,527
I'm sorry. You know,
we went to a surgeon today.

818
00:43:36,163 --> 00:43:39,690
I'm trying to do what's best, and
I feel like I'm in a battlefield.

819
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:42,460
The more information I get,
the less I know.

820
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:44,467
I don't have anybody to talk with.

821
00:43:44,672 --> 00:43:46,139
What about Carla?

822
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:50,333
Yeah, she's looking for me
to take the lead on this thing.

823
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:53,012
I can't go back and forth
over it with her.

824
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:54,441
Your girlfriend's a doctor.

825
00:43:54,648 --> 00:43:56,548
Why can't you talk with Elizabeth?

826
00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:00,345
- Hey, hey.
- Peter?

827
00:44:01,922 --> 00:44:03,890
- Hey, come on.
- Peter?

828
00:44:04,091 --> 00:44:06,821
Come on. Hey, man.
