1
00:00:04,181 --> 00:00:08,537
- We are condemned to useless labor.
- Fourth circle of hell.

2
00:00:08,798 --> 00:00:12,631
Charting goes a lot faster
when you eliminate all classic poetry.

3
00:00:12,979 --> 00:00:16,203
Writing down what we already know
to be read by nobody.

4
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:19,164
I'm sure Dante would agree
that qualifies as useless.

5
00:00:19,251 --> 00:00:22,387
You're over two weeks behind in your charting.

6
00:00:23,435 --> 00:00:26,400
- Oops. I missed.
- What are you, eight?

7
00:00:26,802 --> 00:00:28,616
Could an eight-year-old do this?

8
00:00:29,314 --> 00:00:31,232
Better stop or it'll stick that way.

9
00:00:32,209 --> 00:00:34,093
You have a patient in exam one.

10
00:00:34,196 --> 00:00:36,917
Yeah, see I'm--I'm off at 12:00,
and it's already five of.

11
00:00:36,987 --> 00:00:39,185
She's been waiting for you since 11:00.

12
00:00:42,499 --> 00:00:44,836
Melancholy without hope.

13
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:47,655
Which circle is that?

14
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:53,724
Hi.

15
00:00:54,248 --> 00:00:55,608
I'm Dr. House.

16
00:00:55,795 --> 00:00:58,446
- What seems to be the problem?
- Show him your hands, Augustine.

17
00:01:07,433 --> 00:01:09,771
It looks like stigmata.

18
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:10,782
Pius.

19
00:01:10,852 --> 00:01:13,468
You must be all the talk
around the holy water cooler.

20
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,050
Been washing a lot of dishes recently?

21
00:01:16,221 --> 00:01:17,442
I help out in the kitchen.

22
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:21,655
- Anything new in the kitchen?
- We just got a donation of saucepans and pots this week.

23
00:01:22,004 --> 00:01:25,248
- I unpacked and washed them.
- Should've spent your time saving souls.

24
00:01:25,283 --> 00:01:26,574
It's easier on the hands.

25
00:01:26,741 --> 00:01:29,950
This is contact dermatitis.
You're allergic to dish soap.

26
00:01:30,334 --> 00:01:31,241
Nonsense.

27
00:01:31,345 --> 00:01:32,601
We've always used that soap.

28
00:01:32,872 --> 00:01:34,441
Why is there a problem now?

29
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,744
I've been a doctor for years.

30
00:01:36,779 --> 00:01:39,046
Why do I have to keep assuring people
that I know what I'm doing

31
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:44,277
A person can become allergic to substances that they've had
repeated and prolonged exposure to.

32
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:48,038
The good news is, free samples.

33
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:51,799
Diphenhydramine.
It's an antihistamine.

34
00:01:51,908 --> 00:01:54,033
It'll stop the allergic reaction.

35
00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:56,704
Take one every eight hours.

36
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,956
It might make you feel a little sleepy.
And get some of that over-the-counter cortisone cream.

37
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,008
- Thank you, Doctor.
- You want some water?

38
00:02:03,062 --> 00:02:04,098
I have some tea.

39
00:02:04,316 --> 00:02:08,350
Well, you just relax for a few minutes.
That stuff works pretty fast.

40
00:02:15,799 --> 00:02:17,652
Still out by 12:00.

41
00:02:17,816 --> 00:02:20,377
How do you solve a problem like dermatitis?

42
00:02:20,814 --> 00:02:22,285
- What?
- Doctor?

43
00:02:22,503 --> 00:02:25,283
I want to thank you for your patience.

44
00:02:25,828 --> 00:02:27,627
Is she talkin' to you?

45
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:29,986
I don't know.
She's certainly looking at me.

46
00:02:30,422 --> 00:02:33,693
Oh, it's good to get a secular diagnosis.

47
00:02:34,001 --> 00:02:37,489
The sisters tend to interpret their illnesses
as divine intervention.

48
00:02:37,544 --> 00:02:40,324
And you don't?
I mean, you're wearing an awfully funny hat.

49
00:02:40,558 --> 00:02:42,738
Ooh, boy.
Excuse me

50
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:46,335
If I break my leg,
I believe it happened for a reason.

51
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,624
I believe God wanted me to break my leg.

52
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:51,677
I also believe he wants me to put a cast on it.

53
00:02:52,058 --> 00:02:53,693
Doctor? Something's wrong.

54
00:03:03,377 --> 00:03:04,794
Lift up your chin.

55
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:10,697
Sister, you're having an asthma attack.
I need you to relax.

56
00:03:10,861 --> 00:03:14,513
Roll up her sleeve, please.
Gonna give you epinephrine.

57
00:03:14,731 --> 00:03:16,802
Open your lungs to help you breathe.

58
00:03:35,812 --> 00:03:37,501
What happened?

59
00:03:37,657 --> 00:03:39,619
- She take the pill?
- Yes.

60
00:03:39,728 --> 00:03:41,581
It was probably an allergic reaction.

61
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:44,470
She's allergic to an anti-allergy medicine?

62
00:03:44,634 --> 00:03:46,541
You figure somebody's out to get her?

63
00:03:46,814 --> 00:03:48,395
- How are you feeling?
- Better.

64
00:03:48,465 --> 00:03:50,809
I'll put you on some steroids instead

65
00:03:51,354 --> 00:03:53,752
Is my heart supposed to be feeling so funny?

66
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:56,314
It's called adrenaline.
Makes your heart beat fast.

67
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,637
But not this fast.
Get a nurse, please.

68
00:04:02,727 --> 00:04:05,234
Lay down, come on.

69
00:04:05,343 --> 00:04:08,014
Help! Somebody help us!

70
00:04:11,121 --> 00:04:12,919
Somebody get in here!

71
00:04:15,225 --> 00:04:18,387
Call a code and charge up the defibrillator.
She's got no pulse.

72
00:04:31,287 --> 00:04:37,143

Episode 1x05 - Damned If You Do

73
00:04:37,781 --> 00:04:47,043
Transcript fourni par Raceman.
Synchronisation : Silverado

74
00:04:47,895 --> 00:04:54,602
Merci à Katie.
www.forom.com

75
00:05:15,035 --> 00:05:21,031
You diagnosed the patient with allergies and prescribed antihistamines.
She went into respiratory distress.

76
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:24,233
And you injected her with epinephrine.

77
00:05:24,841 --> 00:05:26,953
Presumable one cc.

78
00:05:27,022 --> 00:05:29,679
Point-one cc. That is the standard dose,
that is what I gave her.

79
00:05:29,815 --> 00:05:32,472
People don't go into cardiac arrest
from point-one cc epinephrine.

80
00:05:32,608 --> 00:05:35,879
She must have a pre-existing heart condition
that got exacerbated by the epinephrine.

81
00:05:35,947 --> 00:05:37,991
It's too bad you didn't make
a notation in the chart.

82
00:05:38,198 --> 00:05:39,560
- I can make it up right now.

83
00:05:39,697 --> 00:05:42,626
The drawer has syringes is with both dosages,
you could've easily reached for the wrong...

84
00:05:42,694 --> 00:05:44,807
- But I didn't.
- Everyone makes mistakes.

85
00:05:44,943 --> 00:05:47,532
This is why doctors pay through the nose
for malpractice insurance.

86
00:05:47,668 --> 00:05:49,780
Relax, they're not gonna sue.

87
00:05:49,985 --> 00:05:52,165
Worst they'd do is whack my hand with a ruler.

88
00:05:52,235 --> 00:05:54,416
And the discipline board,
are they gonna whack your hand too?

89
00:05:54,552 --> 00:05:56,664
- You're gonna report me?
- What choice do I have?

90
00:05:56,937 --> 00:06:00,003
How about not report me?

91
00:06:01,638 --> 00:06:05,726
I can justify keeping her here
for a 24-hour observation.

92
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:10,904
If you haven't found an underlying cause for the cardiac arrest
by then, I will have to notify our attorneys.

93
00:06:17,805 --> 00:06:21,075
Her hands were red and swollen.
Maybe she has a skin infection, cellulitis?

94
00:06:21,144 --> 00:06:23,528
That could manifest with hypo-cardio.
There's no history of fever.

95
00:06:23,665 --> 00:06:25,845
Results from the CVC didn't indicate an infection.

96
00:06:25,913 --> 00:06:27,276
The centifills were mildly elevated.

97
00:06:27,398 --> 00:06:29,919
Rates up a bit. Could we be looking
at a systemic allergic response?

98
00:06:29,987 --> 00:06:32,780
It's no allergic, and allergies don't cause
cardiac arrest like this.

99
00:06:32,848 --> 00:06:35,097
- Could be inflammation of the blood vessels.
- Vasculitis?

100
00:06:35,165 --> 00:06:37,141
That wouldn't give you an
elevated eosinophil count.

101
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,983
Churg Strauss Vasculitis would.

102
00:06:39,187 --> 00:06:43,888
Blood vessels of the heart, lungs, and skin become inflamed,
causing the asthma, rash, and heart problems.

103
00:06:44,433 --> 00:06:47,091
Covers all her symptoms.
Need a biopsy to diagnose.

104
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:50,293
- Chest CT would be quicker.
- The lady just came in with a rash.

105
00:06:51,179 --> 00:06:52,746
What the hell are those?

106
00:06:53,223 --> 00:06:54,449
Candy canes.

107
00:06:54,994 --> 00:06:56,834
Candy canes?

108
00:06:57,245 --> 00:06:58,812
Are you mocking me?

109
00:06:59,016 --> 00:07:04,126
No, i-it's Christmas, and I--
I--I thought--

110
00:07:04,262 --> 00:07:06,102
Relax. It was a joke.

111
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:09,577
- Isn't the prognosis for Churg Strauss a bit grim?
- Yeah.

112
00:07:10,089 --> 00:07:14,109
Untreated, only 33% of patients
survive past a year, treated, five years.

113
00:07:14,245 --> 00:07:15,948
Then I definitely suggest treatment.

114
00:07:16,017 --> 00:07:21,058
If it was any other attending doctor, I'd say
that he made a mistake and gave her too much epinephrine.

115
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:26,103
Saying you wouldn't say it was my mistake.
Saying it was my mistake.

116
00:07:26,784 --> 00:07:29,237
Everyone screws up. Your rule.

117
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:33,052
- I think you fit within the subset of everyone.
- I didn't screw up.

118
00:07:34,008 --> 00:07:38,505
Order a chest CT and start the sister on Prednisone.
40 milligrams, TID.

119
00:07:38,641 --> 00:07:39,595
The sister?

120
00:07:39,731 --> 00:07:43,411
Oh, didn't I mention?
Patient's a nun. Sister Augustine.

121
00:07:44,773 --> 00:07:46,749
I hate nuns.

122
00:07:47,771 --> 00:07:49,134
Who doesn't?

123
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,765
Sister Augustine?

124
00:08:04,515 --> 00:08:08,603
We weren't watching.
We were trying to see if this is the bed control.

125
00:08:08,728 --> 00:08:13,020
Oh, um, this one's the bed control.
And that's the TV control.

126
00:08:13,497 --> 00:08:17,108
I'm Dr. Cameron.
This is Dr. Chase and Dr. Forman.

127
00:08:17,245 --> 00:08:19,970
I haven't seen television in over 20 years.

128
00:08:20,106 --> 00:08:24,194
Do you consider it the work of the Devil,
or do you just not get cable where you live?

129
00:08:26,104 --> 00:08:27,671
How are you feeling, Sister?

130
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,669
I seem to be a little better.
They gave me some medication.

131
00:08:30,805 --> 00:08:33,326
Prednisone. It's a steroid to help
with the inflammation.

132
00:08:33,394 --> 00:08:36,392
Has Dr. House figured out what I have?
Will I be okay?

133
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,687
We're not sure what's wrong yet.

134
00:08:37,823 --> 00:08:41,025
You'll have a chest CT scan this afternoon
that'll help the diagnosis.

135
00:08:41,094 --> 00:08:44,568
Dr. House was giving her medication,
and he doesn't know what she has yet?

136
00:08:44,606 --> 00:08:47,399
Trust, Sister Pious.
It all happens for a reason.

137
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,716
He doesn't know what he's doing.

138
00:08:49,852 --> 00:08:52,714
The only problem that woman has
is that House grabbed the wrong syringe.

139
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:53,804
You don't trust him?

140
00:08:54,165 --> 00:08:56,886
I don't trust a man who won't
admit he might be wrong.

141
00:08:56,981 --> 00:09:00,888
I notice you weren't so quick to tell her she's got
Churg Strauss and only has a couple of years to live.

142
00:09:00,923 --> 00:09:02,423
I don't tell patients bad news
unless it's conclusive.

143
00:09:02,492 --> 00:09:04,341
Because you know he might be wrong.

144
00:09:04,404 --> 00:09:06,776
About Churg Strauss, not about what happened in the clinic.

145
00:09:07,787 --> 00:09:10,124
What about you, Chase?
You think he's infallible too?

146
00:09:10,536 --> 00:09:14,722
All I know is, if House didn't make a mistake,
and Sister Augustine has Churg Strauss,

147
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:17,408
he'll be self-satisfied, and our lives
will be good for a few weeks.

148
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:21,830
If House did make a mistake, he'll be upset
and our lives will be miserable for months.

149
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,807
There is that.

150
00:09:22,912 --> 00:09:26,784
If Cuddy thinks I made a mistake, the least
she could do is suspend me from clinic duty.

151
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,706
She doesn't confuse making a mistake
with being incompetent.

152
00:09:29,776 --> 00:09:32,079
Oh, here we go.
Lesson time.

153
00:09:33,544 --> 00:09:36,125
I recognize that confidence
is not my short suit.

154
00:09:36,186 --> 00:09:38,942
I also recognize that I am human
and capable of error.

155
00:09:39,082 --> 00:09:40,756
So you might've screwed this up?

156
00:09:41,175 --> 00:09:41,803
No.

157
00:09:41,969 --> 00:09:44,307
So it's merely a theoretical
capacity for error.

158
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:45,388
Good point.

159
00:09:45,563 --> 00:09:47,725
Maybe there isn't one.
Maybe that's my error.

160
00:09:48,249 --> 00:09:51,737
You know, most people who think as much of
themselves as you do like to talk about themselves.

161
00:09:51,764 --> 00:09:52,950
Most people don't like to listen.

162
00:09:53,055 --> 00:09:53,997
So what's wrong with you?

163
00:10:06,495 --> 00:10:07,402
Lemme guess.

164
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:09,181
Inflammatory bowel.

165
00:10:09,295 --> 00:10:11,841
Wow, yeah. Is it that bad?

166
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:12,923
Yes.

167
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:15,706
It's also written on your chart.

168
00:10:16,578 --> 00:10:18,810
Bloody diarrhea, gas, pain.

169
00:10:18,845 --> 00:10:20,903
Took sulfasalazine, but it didn't work.

170
00:10:22,012 --> 00:10:27,384
Next tried steroid enemas, oral corticosteroids,
5ASA, 6-mercaptopuine.

171
00:10:27,454 --> 00:10:29,442
- I'm impressed.
- By my medical history?

172
00:10:29,574 --> 00:10:31,667
By how well your last doctor charted.

173
00:10:31,981 --> 00:10:36,656
It's one thing to have to go to the bathroom every hour,
but when the kids sit on my lap, it's...

174
00:10:37,388 --> 00:10:39,168
The store sent me home.
They're gonna fire me.

175
00:10:39,237 --> 00:10:41,679
Can't you put me back on 5ASA?
Maybe it'll work this time.

176
00:10:41,714 --> 00:10:44,016
Not likely. I'm giving you a prescription.

177
00:10:44,191 --> 00:10:47,749
It's cheap, which is good,
'cause your insurance company won't pay for it.

178
00:10:55,851 --> 00:10:59,165
- Cogaritis?
- Cigarettes.

179
00:10:59,653 --> 00:11:01,746
One twice a day.
No more, no less.

180
00:11:01,811 --> 00:11:06,799
Studies have shown that cigarette smoking is one of the most
effective ways to control inflammatory bowel.

181
00:11:07,205 --> 00:11:10,205
Plus it's been well-established
that you'll look 30% cooler.

182
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:13,519
- Are you kidding me?
- About the looking cooler? Yeah.

183
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:16,414
- The rest is true.
- Isn't it addictive and dangerous?

184
00:11:16,691 --> 00:11:19,935
Pretty much all the drugs I prescribe
are addictive and dangerous

185
00:11:20,075 --> 00:11:22,691
The only difference with this one
is it's completely legal.

186
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,000
Merry Christmas.

187
00:11:27,326 --> 00:11:29,070
I was talking to the nurse.

188
00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:31,058
Arsenio. Do you know him?

189
00:11:31,501 --> 00:11:34,466
- Not really.
- He can take pictures with his phone.

190
00:11:34,849 --> 00:11:35,791
Cool.

191
00:11:36,202 --> 00:11:38,435
That woman from the lab
was interesting too.

192
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:41,365
She studied astrophysics
before becoming a nurse.

193
00:11:41,505 --> 00:11:43,388
You know this stuff better than I do.

194
00:11:43,485 --> 00:11:45,265
Well, I love to hear all about people.

195
00:11:45,265 --> 00:11:46,869
You live in a monastery.

196
00:11:46,974 --> 00:11:49,695
It's where I serve our Lord and the world best.

197
00:11:49,765 --> 00:11:51,299
Our Lord, maybe.

198
00:11:51,815 --> 00:11:55,583
The rest of the world, on the other hand,
would probably get more out of feeding the homeless or...

199
00:11:55,617 --> 00:11:56,734
Healing the sick?

200
00:11:57,013 --> 00:11:59,908
- As an example, yeah.
- Did you always want to be a doctor?

201
00:12:00,658 --> 00:12:01,704
Always.

202
00:12:01,809 --> 00:12:03,030
You always want to be a nun

203
00:12:03,065 --> 00:12:05,053
My parents died when I was six.

204
00:12:05,123 --> 00:12:08,332
I was raised in a foster home run by the Church.

205
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:12,448
When I was 18, I went to the monastery,
where they let me take my vows.

206
00:12:12,834 --> 00:12:15,520
I've known no other life,
and I haven't wanted to.

207
00:12:16,454 --> 00:12:19,454
Okay, Sister, we need you
to lie as still as possible.

208
00:12:19,594 --> 00:12:21,478
If you get scared, just let us know.

209
00:12:21,582 --> 00:12:24,094
As Jonah said from inside the whale,

210
00:12:24,261 --> 00:12:28,168
"When I lost all hope, I turned my thoughts to the Lord."

211
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,679
She's got God on her side.

212
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:31,865
I don't believe it God.

213
00:12:31,962 --> 00:12:33,880
You're not even a little agnostic?

214
00:12:34,194 --> 00:12:35,834
Is it supposed to smell funny?

215
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,349
Someone ralphed in there this morning.
We cleaned it up, but...

216
00:12:39,628 --> 00:12:43,047
It's normal, Sister.
I-it's just a few more minutes.

217
00:12:43,842 --> 00:12:49,109
I believe in a higher order, that can control what happens,
but not one anthropomorphic entity called "God"

218
00:12:49,179 --> 00:12:51,446
that's concerned with the
everyday workings of you and me.

219
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:54,544
What else is there to control
but the everyday workings of you and me?

220
00:12:54,613 --> 00:12:56,637
It's always about you, Foreman.

221
00:12:56,706 --> 00:13:00,020
What are you talking about? The trees, the fish?
Should they be the ones that think it's all about them?

222
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,358
What about you, Chase?
You believe in God?

223
00:13:04,478 --> 00:13:07,652
I believe Sister Augustine
has no vascular pathology.

224
00:13:07,714 --> 00:13:10,400
- Which means no Churg Strauss.
- Which means House made a mistake.

225
00:13:10,434 --> 00:13:12,632
No, not necessarily.
It could be something else.

226
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,481
Thyrotoxicosis, or carcinoid...

227
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:18,904
You don't believe in God, but you're willing
to put complete faith in one man?

228
00:13:19,043 --> 00:13:21,206
Please...the smell.

229
00:13:21,415 --> 00:13:22,636
Let's get her out of there.

230
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,675
I'm coming, Sister.

231
00:13:27,094 --> 00:13:28,454
Oh, the smell.

232
00:13:28,594 --> 00:13:29,885
I'm gonna be sick, sick.

233
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:31,803
- There's no smell.
- Oh--oh, God!

234
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:36,261
Oh, it's Jesus. It's Jesus.

235
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,458
He's coming for me!

236
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:41,346
He's burning me with his touch!

237
00:13:41,486 --> 00:13:42,846
Let's get her on some Ativan.

238
00:13:42,881 --> 00:13:43,439
Please!

239
00:13:43,474 --> 00:13:47,102
Smells, religious visions,
symptomatic type of lobe swelling.

240
00:13:47,163 --> 00:13:48,105
We don't... we don't want her to...

241
00:13:49,082 --> 00:13:50,059
She's seizing.

242
00:13:50,373 --> 00:13:51,210
Jaw block.

243
00:13:51,314 --> 00:13:52,605
Help me get her on her side.

244
00:13:54,935 --> 00:13:56,574
- Religious visions?
- Yeah.

245
00:13:57,272 --> 00:13:58,632
And next comes...

246
00:14:04,409 --> 00:14:06,746
Patient tested positive for herpetic encephalitis.

247
00:14:06,857 --> 00:14:09,474
- So what's that tell us?
- Her immune systemis severely compromised.

248
00:14:09,501 --> 00:14:12,571
Oh, I know. Prednisone
compromises the immune system.

249
00:14:12,676 --> 00:14:15,082
Isn't that the medicinethat you gave her
for that thing she doesn't have?

250
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:17,831
Yeah, the... hey.

251
00:14:18,598 --> 00:14:20,168
I'm thinking that's a trick question.

252
00:14:20,203 --> 00:14:24,528
Her immune system is severely compromised.
Two doses of Prednisone wouldn't do that.

253
00:14:24,555 --> 00:14:26,927
Are you hanging your diagnosis on an adverb?

254
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:31,008
In 10 seconds, I'm going to announce
that I gave her the wrong dose in the clinic.

255
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,582
- You're gonna admit negligence?
- Unless you leave the room.

256
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,605
If you stay, you'll have to testify.

257
00:14:36,861 --> 00:14:41,710
Five... four... three... two...

258
00:14:41,842 --> 00:14:47,807
So there I was in the clinic, drunk. I open the drawer,
close my eyes,  take the first syringe I can find...

259
00:14:50,381 --> 00:14:53,660
So, what are the options
for compromised immune system?

260
00:14:53,765 --> 00:14:55,579
Mixed connective tissue disease.

261
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,152
It'd explain why she was feeling
better on the Prednisone.

262
00:14:58,396 --> 00:15:01,500
Sure she was feeling better right
up to the moment when it almost killed her.

263
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:04,047
On the other hand,
it explains the symptoms.

264
00:15:04,249 --> 00:15:07,702
Swollen hands, pulmonary problems,
cardiac problems, it all fits.

265
00:15:07,772 --> 00:15:09,865
- Except her ANA was normal.
- So redraw the blood.

266
00:15:09,962 --> 00:15:12,125
But the treatment is corticosteroids, Prednisone.

267
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,218
And we can't go there because of the encephalitis.

268
00:15:14,253 --> 00:15:18,125
Well, treat it with something that modulates
the immune system, but doesn't suppress it.

269
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,966
Hyperbaric oxygen chamber.

270
00:15:20,036 --> 00:15:23,489
There's no protocol for putting a patient
in a high-pressure oxygen room...

271
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:28,366
- ... to treat autoimmune problems.
- Oh, you people, always with the protocols.

272
00:15:29,482 --> 00:15:31,121
Prep the nun.

273
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,180
And discontinue the Prednisone.

274
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:44,492
I am both amused and annoyed that you think
I should be less stubborn than you are.

275
00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:48,654
You are aware of the Hippocratic Oath, right?

276
00:15:49,038 --> 00:15:51,549
The one that starts "First, do nor harm,"

277
00:15:51,619 --> 00:15:56,398
and then goes on to tell us no abortions, no seductions,
and definitely no cutting of those who labor beneath the stone?

278
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,265
Yeah, I took a read once, wasn't impressed.

279
00:15:58,334 --> 00:16:02,625
Hyperbaric treatments could cause
oxygen toxicity, lung and eye damage.

280
00:16:02,653 --> 00:16:03,943
Every treatment has its dangers.

281
00:16:03,978 --> 00:16:08,269
Which is why we only treat if we're convinced
the patient actually needs the treatment.

282
00:16:08,304 --> 00:16:10,815
I'm convinced. You're not.

283
00:16:11,373 --> 00:16:13,397
The question is, what are you gonna do about it?

284
00:16:16,981 --> 00:16:20,225
I have an opening Thursday at 3:00.
Do you have a fourth?

285
00:16:21,055 --> 00:16:22,241
Is he any good?

286
00:16:23,636 --> 00:16:25,695
Uh, can I call you right back? Okay.

287
00:16:27,983 --> 00:16:28,925
What's up?

288
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:36,389
The pressure will force the oxygen
into your system, and saturate your blood.

289
00:16:36,633 --> 00:16:39,563
It will enhance white cell activity,
reduce the inflammation.

290
00:16:39,668 --> 00:16:43,191
And that will help with this
mixed connective tissue disease?

291
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:45,974
We'll be doing about 10 treatments,
and then we'll reevaluate.

292
00:16:46,637 --> 00:16:49,916
The last treatment with Prednisone
caused the seizures, right?

293
00:16:50,187 --> 00:16:52,768
How confident is Dr. House about this?

294
00:16:53,256 --> 00:16:58,559
That you reacted so strongly to the Prednisone let us know
that you had an underlying problem with your immune system.

295
00:16:58,656 --> 00:17:00,330
Then I guess it was a blessing.

296
00:17:01,237 --> 00:17:02,423
Of sorts.

297
00:17:06,174 --> 00:17:08,686
So who's your favorite reindeer, Nurse Arnold?

298
00:17:08,965 --> 00:17:10,918
- Rudolph.
- I would have thought it was Vixen.

299
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,255
- What are you implying?
- Nothing.

300
00:17:13,745 --> 00:17:19,711
But I saw you at the Christmas party
with Dr. Miles and Dr. Jargons and Nurse Crandall.

301
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,699
I was just doing some Christmas dancing.

302
00:17:21,761 --> 00:17:23,471
This is a chapel.

303
00:17:23,924 --> 00:17:25,459
A house of prayer.

304
00:17:26,261 --> 00:17:28,389
A house of prayer. Huh.

305
00:17:29,113 --> 00:17:30,718
Well, that explainsthe good reception.

306
00:17:30,927 --> 00:17:33,648
Also why nobody's ever here.

307
00:17:35,838 --> 00:17:37,687
I need to talk with you, Dr. House.

308
00:17:38,071 --> 00:17:40,827
Sister Augustine believes
in things that aren't real.

309
00:17:42,431 --> 00:17:44,873
I thought that was a job
requirement for you people.

310
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:47,133
She's been known to lie.

311
00:17:48,075 --> 00:17:50,831
To get sympathy. She's a hypochondriac.

312
00:17:51,451 --> 00:17:55,602
So you're warning me that I may be treating
a non-existent ailment.

313
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:58,079
Sore throats, joint pains.

314
00:17:58,358 --> 00:17:59,649
There's always something wrong.

315
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,140
And there's never a reason for it.

316
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,233
Mother Superior plays right into it.

317
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:06,094
Lets Augustine off work duties.

318
00:18:06,261 --> 00:18:09,330
Treating her as...fragile. Special.

319
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:10,900
That must make you angry.

320
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,516
It bothers me.

321
00:18:13,788 --> 00:18:16,334
It's not really in Augustine's best interest.

322
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:21,916
Want some?

323
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,220
I shouldn't.

324
00:18:31,005 --> 00:18:35,017
I guess you gotta be good at reading people
to be a good infirmarian, huh?

325
00:18:36,892 --> 00:18:40,729
So we got pride, anger, envy, gluttony.

326
00:18:41,462 --> 00:18:44,392
That four out of seven deadly sins
in under two minutes.

327
00:18:44,699 --> 00:18:48,152
Do you people keep records of these things?
Is there a Cath-lympics?

328
00:18:49,826 --> 00:18:52,896
- They say you have a gift.
- They like to talk.

329
00:18:52,993 --> 00:18:54,703
You hide behind your intelligence.

330
00:18:54,772 --> 00:18:56,028
Yeah, that's pretty stupid.

331
00:18:56,098 --> 00:18:58,889
And you make jokes because you're afraid
to take anything seriously.

332
00:18:59,684 --> 00:19:02,056
Because if you take things seriously, they matter.

333
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,846
- And if they matter...
- Then when things go wrong, I get hurt.

334
00:19:05,056 --> 00:19:07,672
- I'm not tough, I'm vulnerable.
- I barely know you.

335
00:19:08,327 --> 00:19:11,153
And I don't know if I'm right.
I just hope I am.

336
00:19:11,711 --> 00:19:13,455
Because the alternative is,

337
00:19:14,292 --> 00:19:16,595
you really are as miserable as you seem to be.

338
00:19:19,795 --> 00:19:22,307
You know, from the way you're looking at me right now,

339
00:19:22,683 --> 00:19:24,497
I'd say you just hit number five.

340
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,904
Lust.

341
00:19:39,936 --> 00:19:43,529
Dr. Brown, I love you too.

342
00:19:51,994 --> 00:19:52,901
How you feeling?

343
00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:56,320
- A little weak.
- That's from the oxygen.

344
00:19:56,524 --> 00:19:57,815
My mouth is dry.

345
00:19:58,024 --> 00:20:01,164
Okay, well, uh,
I'll get you some of your tea.

346
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:06,869
Mixed connective tissue disease?
Her ANA is barely elevated.

347
00:20:07,462 --> 00:20:10,392
Well, thanks for checking upon her.
Good to know you got my back.

348
00:20:10,463 --> 00:20:14,195
O2 sats down to 83.
Pulmonary problems, breathing problems...

349
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,079
Irritation from the oxygen is typical.

350
00:20:16,106 --> 00:20:19,106
She comes in with a rash,
and you put herinto cardiac arrest.

351
00:20:19,141 --> 00:20:21,269
That well just never runs dry, does it?

352
00:20:21,374 --> 00:20:24,897
If there was no underlying problem,
why is she still having the rapid heart rate?

353
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:28,098
Maybe from the herpetic encephalitis
caused by you giving her Prednisone.

354
00:20:28,133 --> 00:20:29,807
Her reaction is a symptom, not an error.

355
00:20:29,807 --> 00:20:32,214
- There's always an explanation, isn't there?
- Yes, there is,

356
00:20:32,241 --> 00:20:33,637
and if this one doesn't work, we'll find another.

357
00:20:33,671 --> 00:20:35,171
But never one involving you screwing up.

358
00:20:35,206 --> 00:20:37,055
One that fits all the facts.

359
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:40,439
Look, we obviously have a difference
of opinion, and that's fine.

360
00:20:40,501 --> 00:20:44,757
I used up all the time I budgeted today
for banging my head against a wall.

361
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:47,505
I am gonna do you the biggest favor
one doctor can do for another.

362
00:20:47,575 --> 00:20:50,226
I am gonna stop you
from killing your patient.

363
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:51,831
You're off the case.

364
00:21:11,065 --> 00:21:12,181
We're gonna treat the symptoms.

365
00:21:12,251 --> 00:21:14,798
- Not the underlying condition?
- There is no underlying condition.

366
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:15,782
What's her status?

367
00:21:15,884 --> 00:21:17,670
The sister's breathing is labored.

368
00:21:17,992 --> 00:21:22,442
Pneumonitis from the hyperbaric chamber.
Put her on 40% oxygen until her O2 sats increase.

369
00:21:22,476 --> 00:21:26,217
BUN and creatinine's rising.
ALT and AST twice the normal range.

370
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,128
Could be from the hypotensive episode.

371
00:21:28,262 --> 00:21:29,981
Let's follow them with labs.

372
00:21:30,116 --> 00:21:33,352
She still has the rash and 
joint pain she came in with.

373
00:21:33,678 --> 00:21:35,330
Order a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory.

374
00:21:35,397 --> 00:21:38,161
When we were looking at the differential diagnosis
with Dr. House, we were considering...

375
00:21:38,195 --> 00:21:40,319
I don't need to hear
what Dr. House was considering.

376
00:21:40,476 --> 00:21:44,049
All of this woman's symptoms can be traced
to Dr. House's considerations.

377
00:21:46,746 --> 00:21:47,757
Okay.

378
00:21:49,196 --> 00:21:51,117
Let's just get this patient healthy.

379
00:21:51,252 --> 00:21:53,645
I want her going out the front door
and not the back.

380
00:21:55,656 --> 00:21:57,949
Hey, it's not like I betrayed him.

381
00:21:58,016 --> 00:22:00,409
Cuddy would've found out
about the hyperbaric treatments eventually.

382
00:22:00,477 --> 00:22:02,331
You did what you felt you had to.

383
00:22:19,192 --> 00:22:20,675
Can't get enough of this place, huh?

384
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,148
I came for my stethoscope.

385
00:22:25,317 --> 00:22:30,137
So I shouldn't read too much into the fact that you were looking for it
in the drawer with the epinephrine syringes in it?

386
00:22:32,195 --> 00:22:35,532
Okay. Yeah.
I'd like to cure my reputation.

387
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:38,566
Oh, right, I forgot how much 
you care about what people think.

388
00:22:38,936 --> 00:22:41,094
Prescribing cigarettes
for inflammatory bowel?

389
00:22:42,342 --> 00:22:43,926
They cause lung cancer, you know.

390
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:46,657
You know why they have 
ribbons for breast cancer,

391
00:22:46,781 --> 00:22:50,050
colorectal cancer, prostate cancer,
and not for lung cancer

392
00:22:50,556 --> 00:22:52,646
They...ran out of colors?

393
00:22:52,702 --> 00:22:55,163
It's because people blame
lung cancer patients.

394
00:22:55,331 --> 00:22:59,410
They smoke, they screwed up, they deserve to die.
The reason people die from lung cancer is guilt.

395
00:23:01,523 --> 00:23:04,489
Well, guilt does a lot of damage.

396
00:23:05,264 --> 00:23:07,152
You said that with great significance.

397
00:23:07,657 --> 00:23:09,275
You're not here to find your stethoscope.

398
00:23:09,702 --> 00:23:11,724
You're not here to clear your reputation.

399
00:23:12,499 --> 00:23:14,589
You're here because you're having doubts.

400
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,758
You might've screwed off.

401
00:23:15,859 --> 00:23:18,691
I'm here because if I'm right,
Cuddy is killing that patient.

402
00:23:18,758 --> 00:23:19,432
Okay.

403
00:23:19,769 --> 00:23:21,017
But if you're wrong?

404
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:25,590
- Then she's saving her. 
- Fine.

405
00:23:25,657 --> 00:23:30,208
You're gonna have to go through every record of every patient
who's been through this clinic in the last two days.

406
00:23:30,365 --> 00:23:33,129
And you're gonna have to hope
that those records can be trusted.

407
00:23:33,534 --> 00:23:35,927
Which, by the way, yours can't.

408
00:23:46,453 --> 00:23:49,688
These pills'll help your kidneys
function a little better, Sister.

409
00:23:56,849 --> 00:23:57,995
Get your wrist.

410
00:24:01,255 --> 00:24:02,266
What's it at?

411
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,322
104.

412
00:24:05,266 --> 00:24:06,243
Is that good?

413
00:24:07,423 --> 00:24:08,097
It's fine.

414
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,805
You're a lousy liar, Dr. Chase.

415
00:24:19,662 --> 00:24:21,887
I have to get this.
Excuse me.

416
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,674
My mother's been dead for ten years.

417
00:24:28,163 --> 00:24:30,051
But she's always with you in spirit.

418
00:24:30,411 --> 00:24:32,433
- What do you know about the nun?
- Which one?

419
00:24:33,377 --> 00:24:35,366
The cute one.
I think she likes me.

420
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:37,793
The sick one, obviously.

421
00:24:37,984 --> 00:24:41,388
Her parents died when she was a child.
And she's been with the Church ever since.

422
00:24:41,456 --> 00:24:43,310
- What's she lying about?
- Why do you say that?

423
00:24:43,703 --> 00:24:44,681
I always say that.

424
00:24:45,052 --> 00:24:48,153
And the old nun thinks 
the sick nun is a big, fat nun liar.

425
00:24:48,254 --> 00:24:50,445
- You know nuns. What do you think?
- I don't know nuns.

426
00:24:50,546 --> 00:24:51,962
You hate nuns.

427
00:24:52,086 --> 00:24:53,737
You can't hate someone if you don't know them.

428
00:24:54,142 --> 00:24:56,299
Know any Nazis?
Maybe I hate them on principle.

429
00:24:57,243 --> 00:25:00,647
I have a theory about what makes good boys good.

430
00:25:00,771 --> 00:25:03,030
It's not because of some moral imperative.

431
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:05,827
Good boys have the fear of God put into them.

432
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,950
Catholic Church specializes
in that kind of training.

433
00:25:09,624 --> 00:25:12,422
To make good boys afraid 
of divine retribution.

434
00:25:12,489 --> 00:25:14,445
So they'll do what their daddies tell 'em.

435
00:25:14,771 --> 00:25:18,546
Like, for example, going into medical school
when it's the last thing they want to do.

436
00:25:19,389 --> 00:25:20,265
What do you think?

437
00:25:22,243 --> 00:25:24,670
I think if she did have a secret,
her boss would know.

438
00:25:31,194 --> 00:25:33,553
Did you paint or put in
new carpets recently?

439
00:25:33,587 --> 00:25:34,295
No.

440
00:25:34,396 --> 00:25:36,284
Any way she could've got access to drugs?

441
00:25:36,385 --> 00:25:40,801
Well, we lock all our medications in the infirmary,
and we don't keep prescription drugs here.

442
00:25:41,019 --> 00:25:44,389
Why haven't you asked Sister Augustine
about these things directly?

443
00:25:45,569 --> 00:25:50,693
I found that when you want to know the truth about someone,
that someone is probably the last person you should ask.

444
00:25:51,489 --> 00:25:53,949
And have you been speaking to Sister Eucharist?

445
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:56,848
She ratted out her fellow sister pretty quickly.

446
00:25:57,151 --> 00:25:59,916
If I were you, I'd have her repeat a year of nun school.

447
00:26:00,387 --> 00:26:02,680
Becoming a nun doesn't make you a saint.

448
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:04,647
Becoming a doctor doesn't make you a healer.

449
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:10,883
And just because we live in a monastery and we spend most of 
our time in prayer doesn't mean we don't find time for drama.

450
00:26:11,187 --> 00:26:13,917
So what is the sick one's drama?

451
00:26:14,445 --> 00:26:17,783
Sister Augustine lived in Catholic foster care...

452
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,400
... until she came to us.

453
00:26:21,323 --> 00:26:22,165
Tea?

454
00:26:22,604 --> 00:26:23,345
Sure.

455
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:28,368
Do all of you lie?

456
00:26:29,109 --> 00:26:30,356
It's a good strategy.

457
00:26:30,435 --> 00:26:32,255
It's simpler when you tell the same lie.

458
00:26:32,322 --> 00:26:35,289
But she does not spend her entire life as a good Catholic.

459
00:26:35,412 --> 00:26:38,884
When she had a cardiac arrest,
I had to open her blouse to do CPR.

460
00:26:38,952 --> 00:26:40,401
And I learned two things.

461
00:26:40,469 --> 00:26:42,289
Nuns can have nice breasts.

462
00:26:42,446 --> 00:26:44,536
And she has a tattoo on her shoulder.

463
00:26:44,738 --> 00:26:46,019
Of a skunk.

464
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:50,267
Now, maybe this was 
the sacred skunk of Joseph,

465
00:26:50,323 --> 00:26:52,008
but as far as I know,

466
00:26:52,447 --> 00:26:56,896
Catholic foster care and monasteries
do not keep tattoo parlors in their refectories.

467
00:26:57,087 --> 00:26:59,379
We consider that our life begins...

468
00:26:59,582 --> 00:27:01,975
... when we put on our habits
and take our vows.

469
00:27:03,896 --> 00:27:05,278
What happens before then...

470
00:27:05,334 --> 00:27:08,165
It's irrelevant to you.
But it's relevant to me.

471
00:27:11,929 --> 00:27:15,469
Sister Augustine went into foster care
when she was six years old.

472
00:27:15,536 --> 00:27:17,592
But she left when she was 12.

473
00:27:18,323 --> 00:27:20,885
She lived on the streets,
she got into drugs.

474
00:27:22,267 --> 00:27:24,525
When she was 15,
she became pregnant.

475
00:27:24,761 --> 00:27:26,143
Tried to self-abort.

476
00:27:26,806 --> 00:27:29,334
She lost the child,
she became ill.

477
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:31,424
We took her in when she came back.

478
00:27:31,829 --> 00:27:35,301
If we had thought that it was medically 
relevant, we would have told you.

479
00:27:37,818 --> 00:27:39,233
It's not.

480
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,928
This tea is delicious.

481
00:27:51,144 --> 00:27:52,256
Local herbs?

482
00:27:53,503 --> 00:27:54,818
Any change with the medication?

483
00:27:54,874 --> 00:27:58,043
Yeah, she's getting worse.
Lung functions deteriorating,

484
00:27:58,077 --> 00:27:59,964
BUN and creatinine continuing to rise.

485
00:28:00,032 --> 00:28:02,122
She's starting to run a fever,
and the rash is spreading.

486
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,806
- At this rate,she's not gonna make Christmas.
- Maybe House was right.

487
00:28:04,941 --> 00:28:07,031
Maybe there is an underlying condition
that explains the symptoms.

488
00:28:07,098 --> 00:28:08,581
Something we haven't considered.

489
00:28:08,649 --> 00:28:09,222
Like what?

490
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:11,143
It could be a metabolic disorder.

491
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,750
- Specifically?
- Might be genetic.

492
00:28:12,784 --> 00:28:14,200
Specifically?

493
00:28:14,267 --> 00:28:16,424
- I'm just saying that...
- You're just saying you think House is right.

494
00:28:16,616 --> 00:28:17,897
Might be right.

495
00:28:17,964 --> 00:28:20,458
Of course he might be right.
It might be the hand of God at work.

496
00:28:20,526 --> 00:28:23,357
Don't say it's something else
unless you've got something concrete to offer.

497
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,494
What's this? Hemlock?

498
00:28:28,595 --> 00:28:31,831
I'm gonna do you the biggest favor
one doctor can do another.

499
00:28:32,067 --> 00:28:34,291
I'm gonna stop you from killing your patient.

500
00:28:35,134 --> 00:28:36,921
It's figwort tea.

501
00:28:37,088 --> 00:28:39,447
Great for that little pick-me-up
we're all looking for in the morning.

502
00:28:39,504 --> 00:28:42,706
Opens the lungs, increases the blood pressure,
stimulates the heart.

503
00:28:42,841 --> 00:28:47,729
Unfortunately, if you then get injected
with even point-one cc of epinephrine,

504
00:28:48,055 --> 00:28:49,909
instant cardiac arrest.

505
00:28:50,448 --> 00:28:52,032
Still, what the hell, it tastes great.

506
00:28:52,369 --> 00:28:55,639
- Sister Augustine...
- ...has been drinking it religiously, so to speak.

507
00:28:56,853 --> 00:28:58,842
And if you take the cardiac arrest
out of the equation...

508
00:28:58,876 --> 00:29:02,887
all the rest of the symptoms can be explained
by a severe long-term allergic reaction.

509
00:29:02,988 --> 00:29:05,246
Well, that's what Cameron 
said in the beginning.

510
00:29:05,381 --> 00:29:06,797
Yes. She did.

511
00:29:08,043 --> 00:29:09,189
Well done.

512
00:29:09,897 --> 00:29:13,841
But your unwillingness to stick 
by your diagnosis almost killed this woman.

513
00:29:14,549 --> 00:29:17,110
Take a lesson from Foreman 
and stand up for what you believe.

514
00:29:18,404 --> 00:29:21,438
Okay. Let's go figure out
how to save a nun.

515
00:29:22,112 --> 00:29:24,775
Damned if you do,
damned if you don't.

516
00:29:26,257 --> 00:29:33,066
'Cause it's been untreated for so long, it's gone from a simple watery eyes, 
scratchy throat allergy to a whopping I'm-gonna-kick-your-ass allergy.

517
00:29:33,122 --> 00:29:37,134
Compromising her immune system, diminishing 
her ability to heal, and breaking down her organ systems.

518
00:29:37,201 --> 00:29:38,920
So what's the source?

519
00:29:39,257 --> 00:29:40,235
The dish soap.

520
00:29:40,527 --> 00:29:43,864
No, symptoms persisted days 
after the dish washing episode.

521
00:29:43,898 --> 00:29:46,898
It's gotta be something she's been exposed to
here in the hospital, as well as the monastery.

522
00:29:46,954 --> 00:29:51,033
- Well, what about the tea? It caused her arrhythmia.
- Aah, could be, but it's not definitive.

523
00:29:51,134 --> 00:29:53,965
- We'll skin test for allergies.
- Not yet, she's too reactive.

524
00:29:54,056 --> 00:29:56,280
She'll test positiveto everything.
We need to stabilize her,

525
00:29:56,348 --> 00:29:59,247
isolate her from all possible allergens
and give her system a rest.

526
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,359
Get her in the clean room.

527
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:03,853
Okay, then we'll gradually introduce 
allergens to see how she responds.

528
00:30:03,886 --> 00:30:06,077
When she reacts to something,
we'll know that's what's killing her.

529
00:30:08,156 --> 00:30:10,718
There you go. 
No television, no books.

530
00:30:10,886 --> 00:30:11,999
Not even my Bible?

531
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,302
I'm afraid not. This room has 
filtered air, filtered water.

532
00:30:15,673 --> 00:30:16,954
You even have silk sheets.

533
00:30:17,078 --> 00:30:19,235
Very decadent and hypoallergenic.

534
00:30:19,673 --> 00:30:21,156
You should be feeling better her

535
00:30:25,394 --> 00:30:27,956
We'll be back to check on you in a little while.

536
00:30:28,057 --> 00:30:31,900
Can the other sisters come in
and pray with me?

537
00:30:33,134 --> 00:30:35,494
It'd be better if you don't have any visitors.

538
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:40,438
Once we isolate what's causing your allergy,
then we can be a little more relax.

539
00:30:51,617 --> 00:30:53,134
I-I can pray with you.

540
00:30:54,314 --> 00:30:55,729
I don't want to die.

541
00:30:57,116 --> 00:30:59,273
Why has He left me?

542
00:31:09,425 --> 00:31:10,942
I was in seminary school.

543
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:15,729
They asked us once 
what our favorite passage was.

544
00:31:15,998 --> 00:31:18,931
I chose First Peter 1:7.

545
00:31:21,124 --> 00:31:25,270
"These trials only test your faith
"to see whether or notit is strong and pure.

546
00:31:25,674 --> 00:31:27,393
"Your faith is being tested.

547
00:31:28,135 --> 00:31:30,292
"As fire tests gold and purifies it.

548
00:31:30,483 --> 00:31:33,450
"And your faith is far more precious 
"to the Lord than mere gold.

549
00:31:33,787 --> 00:31:37,798
"So if your faith remains strong
"after being tested,it will bring you

550
00:31:37,922 --> 00:31:41,023
"much praise and glory and honor

551
00:31:42,439 --> 00:31:44,023
"on the day of His return."

552
00:31:45,197 --> 00:31:46,478
He hasn't left you.

553
00:31:50,152 --> 00:31:53,658
The only thing in the way of you 
knowing He's there is your fear.

554
00:31:53,827 --> 00:31:56,726
You have a choice.
Faith or fear.

555
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,191
That's the test.

556
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,618
Choosing faith doesn't mean I won't die.

557
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:04,180
But it will affect how you will experience your death.

558
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:06,640
And therefore your life.

559
00:32:06,775 --> 00:32:07,719
It's up to you.

560
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:10,944
Why did you leave seminary school?

561
00:32:12,933 --> 00:32:14,011
That test...

562
00:32:15,686 --> 00:32:16,798
...you passed,

563
00:32:17,573 --> 00:32:18,484
I didn't.

564
00:32:19,899 --> 00:32:21,517
We'll call you if anything changes.

565
00:32:21,574 --> 00:32:23,091
Will she be all right?

566
00:32:23,192 --> 00:32:27,136
As long as she's not exposed to anything
that can aggravate her allergy, she'll be fine.

567
00:32:28,439 --> 00:32:29,686
Need some help in here.

568
00:32:36,046 --> 00:32:38,304
Screw the procedure.
She's in anaphylactic shock.

569
00:32:38,372 --> 00:32:40,394
No way, she's in the damn clean room!
Are you kidding me?

570
00:32:40,529 --> 00:32:41,338
Get in here!

571
00:32:43,967 --> 00:32:45,315
Point-one cc of epi.

572
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:47,159
We've got to intubate.

573
00:32:47,192 --> 00:32:48,878
I got it. Get the ambu bag.

574
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:03,058
I'm in.

575
00:33:16,377 --> 00:33:17,624
Breathing stabilized.

576
00:33:20,126 --> 00:33:21,508
It's a clean room.

577
00:33:30,043 --> 00:33:33,110
How do you get an allergic reaction in a clean room?

578
00:33:34,998 --> 00:33:38,133
- Maybe it was the preservatives in the IV.
- Checked that.

579
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:41,755
- Latex tubing?
- Checked that. Checked everything.

580
00:33:42,586 --> 00:33:46,463
Well, it could bemast cell leukemia.
It can cause anaphylaxis.

581
00:33:46,598 --> 00:33:47,845
We checked the blood levels.

582
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:52,351
And it's not eosinophilia odiopathic anaphylaxis.

583
00:33:52,755 --> 00:33:54,946
Maybe it's just divine will.

584
00:33:56,261 --> 00:33:58,418
It's not my will.

585
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,249
You do realize, if you're wrong...

586
00:34:05,305 --> 00:34:06,990
about the big picture, that is...

587
00:34:07,092 --> 00:34:08,440
you're going to burn, right?

588
00:34:08,642 --> 00:34:11,069
What do you want me to do?
Just accept it, pack it in?

589
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:14,901
Yeah, I want you to accept
that sometimes patients die against all reason.

590
00:34:14,968 --> 00:34:18,743
- And sometimes they get better against all reason.
- No, they don't. We just don't know the reason.

591
00:34:18,867 --> 00:34:21,261
I think the nuns would agree with you on that.

592
00:34:31,004 --> 00:34:34,071
I just wanted to say that I know 
you did everything you could.

593
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:37,206
I don't need verification from you
to know that I'm doing my job well.

594
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:38,969
That's your problem, not mine.

595
00:34:39,137 --> 00:34:40,486
I was just being nice.

596
00:34:40,553 --> 00:34:42,845
Yeah, well, you don't need
to always do that.

597
00:34:45,723 --> 00:34:46,937
Merry Christmas.

598
00:34:58,493 --> 00:35:00,616
Sister Augustine's been extubated.

599
00:35:02,807 --> 00:35:03,414
Good.

600
00:35:03,632 --> 00:35:06,261
She's requested to check out
against medical advice.

601
00:35:06,429 --> 00:35:08,081
She wants to go back to the monastery.

602
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:10,137
Well, talk her out of it.

603
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,328
I think I may have talked her into it.

604
00:35:30,657 --> 00:35:32,679
Room's paid up for the rest of the week.

605
00:35:34,297 --> 00:35:35,848
Might as well stick around.

606
00:35:36,421 --> 00:35:40,061
This illness is a test of my faith.

607
00:35:40,723 --> 00:35:42,880
If it's His will to take me,

608
00:35:43,217 --> 00:35:45,037
it doesn't matter where I am.

609
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:46,723
I can accept that.

610
00:35:47,756 --> 00:35:50,386
Does anybody believe anything you say?

611
00:35:52,206 --> 00:35:53,689
You're not accepting.

612
00:35:55,666 --> 00:35:57,149
You're running away.

613
00:35:57,317 --> 00:35:59,037
Just like you always do.

614
00:36:00,014 --> 00:36:02,778
You ran away from the monastery to get laid.

615
00:36:03,778 --> 00:36:07,453
You ran away from the real world
when getting laid didn't work out so good.

616
00:36:07,924 --> 00:36:10,958
Now things aren't working 
out again, so off you go.

617
00:36:11,655 --> 00:36:14,486
Why is it so difficult for you to believe in God?

618
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:19,498
What I have difficulty with
is the whole concept of belief.

619
00:36:20,037 --> 00:36:22,532
Faith isn't based on logic and experience.

620
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:25,734
I experience God on a daily basis.

621
00:36:26,696 --> 00:36:29,123
And the miracle of life all around.

622
00:36:29,595 --> 00:36:31,280
The miracle of birth.

623
00:36:31,955 --> 00:36:33,842
The miracle of love.

624
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:36,303
He is always with me.

625
00:36:36,633 --> 00:36:40,779
Where is the miracle in delivering 
a crack-addicted baby?

626
00:36:43,195 --> 00:36:46,836
And watching her mother abandon her
'cause she needs another score.

627
00:36:47,366 --> 00:36:48,478
Miracle of love.

628
00:36:49,523 --> 00:36:54,714
You are over twice as likely to be killed
by the person you love than by a stranger.

629
00:36:55,557 --> 00:36:57,815
Are you trying to talk me out of my faith?

630
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,284
You can have all the faith you want
in spirits and the afterlife.

631
00:37:02,476 --> 00:37:03,925
And heaven and hell.

632
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:07,903
But when it comes to this world, don't be an idiot.

633
00:37:09,004 --> 00:37:12,442
'Cause you can tell me that you put your faith
in God to get you through the day.

634
00:37:12,611 --> 00:37:15,644
But when it comes time to cross the road,
I know you look both ways.

635
00:37:15,735 --> 00:37:20,117
I don't believe He is inside me
and is going to save me.

636
00:37:20,487 --> 00:37:25,308
I believe He is inside me
whether I live or die.

637
00:37:25,364 --> 00:37:27,083
Then you might as well live.

638
00:37:29,274 --> 00:37:31,701
You got a better shot betting on me than on Him.

639
00:37:33,443 --> 00:37:35,061
When I was 15,

640
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:39,241
I was on every kind of birth 
control known to man.

641
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:42,432
And I still got pregnant.

642
00:37:44,185 --> 00:37:45,668
I blamed God.

643
00:37:46,095 --> 00:37:48,893
I hated Him for ruining my life.

644
00:37:48,994 --> 00:37:51,016
But then I realized something.

645
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:56,364
You can't be angry with God
and not believe in Him at the same time.

646
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:58,049
No one can.

647
00:37:58,555 --> 00:38:00,544
Not even you, Dr. House.

648
00:38:05,818 --> 00:38:06,863
How'd it go?

649
00:38:07,234 --> 00:38:09,694
She has God inside her.

650
00:38:09,892 --> 00:38:12,016
Would've been easier to deal with a tumor.

651
00:38:13,128 --> 00:38:14,847
Maybe she's allergic to God.

652
00:38:20,259 --> 00:38:24,574
We've looked everywhere for an allergen
that could be causing this reaction except one place.

653
00:38:24,634 --> 00:38:25,612
Inside her.

654
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:27,904
On her medical history,
she didn't mention any surgery.

655
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,803
She had one.

656
00:38:28,871 --> 00:38:31,972
- Can we get her records? What hospital was it at?
- She didn't have it at a hospital.

657
00:38:32,612 --> 00:38:34,062
Order a full body scan.

658
00:38:34,129 --> 00:38:35,612
What if she refuses?

659
00:38:35,747 --> 00:38:37,432
Tell her I'm looking for a miracle. 

660
00:38:40,219 --> 00:38:42,781
No piercings. No fillings.

661
00:38:43,455 --> 00:38:45,882
No surgical pins in the arm.

662
00:38:46,208 --> 00:38:48,433
- No implants.
- It's clean as a whistle.

663
00:38:48,601 --> 00:38:50,118
What's House looking for?

664
00:38:52,006 --> 00:38:53,253
What is that?

665
00:38:54,185 --> 00:38:55,061
Don't know.

666
00:38:55,398 --> 00:38:58,162
Lock on it.
Get a 3-D representation.

667
00:39:03,655 --> 00:39:04,667
Oh, my God.

668
00:39:08,893 --> 00:39:10,342
The copper cross.

669
00:39:10,511 --> 00:39:13,309
A form of birth control pulled off the market in the '80s.

670
00:39:13,612 --> 00:39:15,500
So she's allergic to copper?

671
00:39:15,657 --> 00:39:17,309
Rare, but it happens.

672
00:39:17,376 --> 00:39:19,096
Didn't she knowshe had an IUD?

673
00:39:19,264 --> 00:39:20,275
She had an abortion.

674
00:39:20,433 --> 00:39:24,377
IUD must have been left in, embedded in the 
endometrial tissue where it couldn't be detected.

675
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:28,051
So all we have to do is remove the IUD.

676
00:39:28,118 --> 00:39:29,770
Then the symptoms should subside.

677
00:39:30,399 --> 00:39:32,927
I got this IUD when I was 15.

678
00:39:33,062 --> 00:39:35,253
I-it's been more than 20 years.

679
00:39:35,321 --> 00:39:37,950
Well, prolonged exposure to an allergen
with minimal symptoms.

680
00:39:38,411 --> 00:39:42,759
But at some point, all it takes is one last contact
to cause a full-blown reaction.

681
00:39:43,018 --> 00:39:46,287
It's like a balloon filled with air.
One last breath, it explodes.

682
00:39:47,197 --> 00:39:51,209
The first time I got the rash
was when I was washing the copper cookware.

683
00:39:51,197 --> 00:39:54,500
And all your subsequent symptoms
came from ingesting food prepared in it.

684
00:39:55,478 --> 00:39:57,601
Dr. House found his miracle.

685
00:39:58,309 --> 00:40:00,096
I doubt he'll interpret it that way.

686
00:40:02,478 --> 00:40:04,601
You told me your favorite passage.

687
00:40:04,938 --> 00:40:06,725
Would you like to hear mine?

688
00:40:08,399 --> 00:40:10,759
"Celebrate and be glad,

689
00:40:10,894 --> 00:40:13,759
"because your brother was dead and is alive again."

690
00:40:13,903 --> 00:40:14,914
The prodigal son.

691
00:40:17,105 --> 00:40:19,633
He'll be waiting for you when you're ready.

692
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:24,150
We'll schedule your surgery for tomorrow.

693
00:40:31,238 --> 00:40:33,395
The sixth circle of hell.

694
00:40:33,501 --> 00:40:37,176
Confined in a sweat box with a bloody nose,
and all the tissues are soggy.

695
00:40:37,243 --> 00:40:38,861
I think that's the seventh.

696
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:41,220
- No, the seventh is...
- God, you must be fun at parties.

697
00:40:41,311 --> 00:40:43,266
I think we both know the flawin that theory.

698
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:46,872
- How's the sister?
- Heart rate is normal, kidney is functioning.

699
00:40:47,176 --> 00:40:50,412
You know how it is with nuns,
you take out their IUDs, they just bounce right back.

700
00:40:50,602 --> 00:40:52,928
- Great.
- Told you I didn't screw up.

701
00:40:54,613 --> 00:40:55,388
You screwed up.

702
00:40:55,512 --> 00:40:57,838
I gave her point-one cc of epinephrine.

703
00:40:57,905 --> 00:41:00,434
Yeah, and if Cuddy hadn't taken you 
off the case, you would've killed her.

704
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:04,479
You wanna come over for Christmas dinner?

705
00:41:05,917 --> 00:41:07,265
You're Jewish.

706
00:41:07,906 --> 00:41:11,378
Yeah, Hanukkah dinner. 
Wh-what do you care? It's food, it's people.

707
00:41:11,445 --> 00:41:12,389
No thanks.

708
00:41:14,265 --> 00:41:15,782
Maybe I'll come to your place.

709
00:41:16,591 --> 00:41:18,883
Your wife doesn't mind
being alone at Christmas?

710
00:41:18,951 --> 00:41:20,973
I'm a doctor, she's used to being alone.

711
00:41:23,558 --> 00:41:25,445
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Neither do I.

712
00:41:30,268 --> 00:41:31,988
You did good.
With the nun.

713
00:41:32,695 --> 00:41:34,111
Congratulations.

714
00:41:35,561 --> 00:41:36,268
Thank you.

715
00:41:37,415 --> 00:41:38,999
Merry Christmas, Dr. House.

716
00:41:39,783 --> 00:41:40,862
Dr. Wilson.

717
00:41:42,432 --> 00:41:43,342
Good night.

718
00:41:46,005 --> 00:41:47,151
That was sweet.
