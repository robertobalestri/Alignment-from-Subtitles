1
00:00:01,055 --> 00:00:02,656
Your primary doctor is right.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,447
The mass is on the smaller side.

3
00:00:04,515 --> 00:00:06,082
We'll confirm with the new images,

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:07,917
but it should be
manageable with medication.

5
00:00:07,985 --> 00:00:09,786
No surgery needed.

6
00:00:09,854 --> 00:00:12,956
Well, my fiance will be so relieved.

7
00:00:13,024 --> 00:00:15,058
He's been worried I'll look like
Frankenstein in all our photos.

8
00:00:15,926 --> 00:00:17,705
Also that I might die.

9
00:00:17,828 --> 00:00:19,190
When's the big day?

10
00:00:19,597 --> 00:00:21,097
June.

11
00:00:21,165 --> 00:00:22,732
You've been dealing
with wedding planning

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,904
on top of a pituitary tumor?

13
00:00:25,803 --> 00:00:27,137
You deserve a medal.

14
00:00:27,204 --> 00:00:29,139
Our medical record system,
on the other hand,

15
00:00:29,206 --> 00:00:31,369
it has you listed as female.

16
00:00:32,176 --> 00:00:33,910
Probably because of the Pap smears.

17
00:00:33,978 --> 00:00:36,813
Software clearly needs a
trans update. Deep breath.

18
00:00:36,881 --> 00:00:38,329
I'll fix it so everything is correct

19
00:00:38,353 --> 00:00:39,353
going forward.

20
00:00:39,383 --> 00:00:41,084
Please confirm your gender and pronouns.

21
00:00:41,152 --> 00:00:43,153
Male, he/him/his. Thanks for asking.

22
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,488
We're the ones with
the messed-up software.

23
00:00:45,556 --> 00:00:48,636
Your scans from this
morning were just uploaded.

24
00:00:56,033 --> 00:00:59,189
In less than two weeks,
the tumor's doubled in size.

34-year-old female, Zara Norton.

29
00:01:12,383 --> 00:01:13,850
Tachycardic and delirious.

30
00:01:13,918 --> 00:01:15,852
Dr. Guerin,
update vitals.

31
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,387
Dr. Wolke,

Pupils are dilated, but reactive.

35
00:01:22,927 --> 00:01:25,695
Ms. Norton,
smells like you've had some marijuana?

36
00:01:25,763 --> 00:01:28,364
Mmm-mmm. I just unloaded
a shipment at the dispensary.

37
00:01:28,432 --> 00:01:29,999
Test for THC and a full tox screen.

38
00:01:30,067 --> 00:01:31,134
I am a peddler.

00:01:31,202 --> 00:01:33,636

40
00:01:33,704 --> 00:01:34,771
Run it.

41
00:01:34,839 --> 00:01:36,673
BP's elevated, 180 over 115.

42
00:01:36,741 --> 00:01:38,074
That could explain the delirium.

43
00:01:38,142 --> 00:01:40,577
Ooh, that sound high.
Better take my meds.

44
00:01:40,644 --> 00:01:42,412
See, I never miss a... Oh, no.

45
00:01:43,881 --> 00:01:45,014
Oh, no, that's not it.

46
00:01:45,082 --> 00:01:46,549
BP's climbing, 210 over 120.

47
00:01:46,617 --> 00:01:48,918
Enalaprilat, 1.25 milligrams, IV.

48
00:01:48,986 --> 00:01:50,186
Ms. Norton, do you remember
the name of your medication?

49
00:01:50,254 --> 00:01:52,255
You can call me Zara.

50
00:01:52,323 --> 00:01:54,591
See? It say right here
on the...

51
00:01:54,658 --> 00:01:56,693
Okay, forget about
the meds. She is not taking any.

52
00:01:56,761 --> 00:01:58,528
This is untreated chronic hypertension.

53
00:01:58,596 --> 00:02:00,663
What if you're wrong? What if she's
on a loop diuretic for her pressure?

54
00:02:00,731 --> 00:02:01,891
This could cause renal failure.

55
00:02:03,234 --> 00:02:04,796
She's heading into hypertensive crisis.

56
00:02:05,341 --> 00:02:06,770
What if we try an
angiotensin receptor blocker?

57
00:02:06,837 --> 00:02:08,138
No drug interaction.

58
00:02:08,205 --> 00:02:10,240
Angiotensin receptor
blockers work too slowly.

59
00:02:10,307 --> 00:02:11,341
I'm giving her the ACE inhibitor.

60
00:02:15,946 --> 00:02:17,080
BP's going down.

61
00:02:17,982 --> 00:02:19,185
Nice call.

Latest budget report.

64
00:02:37,334 --> 00:02:39,035
Yeah, the PDF's sitting in my inbox.

65
00:02:39,103 --> 00:02:40,970
I'm trying to ignore it.

66
00:02:41,038 --> 00:02:42,475
And thus...

67
00:02:45,109 --> 00:02:46,242
A sit-down visit?

68
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,577
Just checking in, see how you're doing.

69
00:02:47,645 --> 00:02:49,546
Okay. You?

70
00:02:49,613 --> 00:02:52,719
Me? I'm... recovering from the year,

71
00:02:53,217 --> 00:02:54,317
like everybody else.

72
00:02:54,385 --> 00:02:56,452
Pandemic, the surge.

73
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,254
You were here for every
minute of every day.

74
00:02:58,322 --> 00:02:59,789
It must have taken a toll.

75
00:02:59,857 --> 00:03:02,192
It... comes with the territory.

76
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:05,315
You're not, uh, stressed or distracted?

77
00:03:06,163 --> 00:03:08,932
I'm... tired.

78
00:03:08,999 --> 00:03:12,001
Okay. Well,
maybe you should take some time off.

79
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:13,114
No.

80
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:17,410
But thank you. I'm fine.

81
00:03:21,812 --> 00:03:23,249
You don't seem fine.

82
00:03:28,352 --> 00:03:30,353
Are there issues with
my work performance?

83
00:03:30,421 --> 00:03:31,688
No, you do great work.

84
00:03:31,755 --> 00:03:33,256
Then I'm not sure why we're
having this conversation.

85
00:03:33,324 --> 00:03:35,053
Because I'm worried about you.

86
00:03:36,427 --> 00:03:38,848
Because other people
are worried about you.

87
00:03:39,563 --> 00:03:42,268
There's no shame in
struggling a little bit.

88
00:03:42,566 --> 00:03:44,100
You know, what would be weird is

89
00:03:44,168 --> 00:03:46,272
if you didn't struggle at all.

90
00:03:47,671 --> 00:03:50,807
If you need to see someone,
the hospital will cover the cost.

91
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:53,738
Great. You'll pay my bills.

92
00:03:54,011 --> 00:03:56,741
And the damage to my reputation,
who takes care of that?

93
00:03:57,848 --> 00:04:00,350
I don't think that seeing a therapist

94
00:04:00,417 --> 00:04:02,997
will affect your career.

95
00:04:03,687 --> 00:04:05,124
Says the white guy.

96
00:04:08,092 --> 00:04:09,462
Okay.

97
00:04:11,562 --> 00:04:13,563
Privacy protections
are there for a reason.

98
00:04:13,631 --> 00:04:15,164
No one needs to know.

99
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,136
Thank you for checking in.

100
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,385
- How you feeling?
- Good.

101
00:04:35,452 --> 00:04:37,854
Be better when I understand
what landed me up in here.

102
00:04:37,922 --> 00:04:40,023
You had an acute hypertensive crisis.

103
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,524
Oh, I know my blood pressure's high.

104
00:04:41,592 --> 00:04:42,659
I'm already on medication for it.

105
00:04:42,726 --> 00:04:44,288
You probably wanna know what it is.

106
00:04:44,595 --> 00:04:46,165
There's no medication.

107
00:04:47,307 --> 00:04:49,065
We need to do an echocardiogram

108
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:50,900
to make sure your heart
wasn't damaged in the crisis.

109
00:04:50,968 --> 00:04:52,380
Fine by me.

110
00:04:53,404 --> 00:04:55,004
Here's 10% discount

111
00:04:55,072 --> 00:04:57,707
on any purchase over $50
or more at Z & B Naturals.

112
00:04:57,775 --> 00:05:00,555
I'm Z. B is my partner Bill.

113
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,512
You're surrounded by pot
all day, every day,

114
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:03,579
but you never touch the stuff?

115
00:05:03,614 --> 00:05:05,014
How? Why?

116
00:05:05,082 --> 00:05:06,769
It's just never been my thing.

117
00:05:09,453 --> 00:05:10,853
Ah.

118
00:05:10,921 --> 00:05:12,021
The name always trips me up.

119
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:13,609
Chlorthalidone.

120
00:05:14,158 --> 00:05:15,391
That's for hypertension.

121
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:17,694
Yeah, bottle seems pretty full.
How long have you been on this?

122
00:05:17,761 --> 00:05:19,738
About six months. Just refilled it.

123
00:05:19,763 --> 00:05:21,242
Take it every day.

124
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,540
Smile.

125
00:05:28,305 --> 00:05:29,333
Head tilt.

126
00:05:30,574 --> 00:05:32,044
Now he smiles.

127
00:05:33,377 --> 00:05:34,644
Burst of laughter.

128
00:05:37,014 --> 00:05:38,014
Yeah.

129
00:05:45,222 --> 00:05:46,823
Rio Gutierrez, 29,

130
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,825
pituitary mass went from
manageable with meds

131
00:05:48,892 --> 00:05:50,626
to likely surgery.

132
00:05:50,694 --> 00:05:54,230
So, talking to the new
radiology resident, huh?

133
00:05:54,298 --> 00:05:57,767
I wanted Dr. D'Souza's opinion
on an intriguing set of scans.

134
00:05:57,835 --> 00:05:59,614
She is very talented.

135
00:06:00,004 --> 00:06:01,491
You're crushing on her.

136
00:06:01,739 --> 00:06:02,909
N... No.

137
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,074
I am not. I love Lea.

138
00:06:05,142 --> 00:06:07,246
Well, those two things
aren't mutually exclusive.

139
00:06:08,912 --> 00:06:11,914
Mr. Gutierrez's blood
has high levels of prolactin.

140
00:06:11,982 --> 00:06:14,117
Prolactin is produced
in the pituitary gland.

141
00:06:14,184 --> 00:06:15,752
The tumor could be secreting it.

142
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:17,754
Or the tumor could be reacting
to the high levels of hormones

143
00:06:17,821 --> 00:06:19,717
being produced elsewhere in the body.

144
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,303
The patient is a transgender man.

145
00:06:25,262 --> 00:06:26,474
Do an ultrasound.

146
00:06:28,365 --> 00:06:30,978
Advance the probe until
you see the cardiac chamber.

147
00:06:32,369 --> 00:06:33,970
Maybe Zara has
secondary hypertension

148
00:06:34,038 --> 00:06:35,505
due to renal vascular disease.

149
00:06:35,572 --> 00:06:37,440
She doesn't. Her creatinine is 1.2.

150
00:06:37,508 --> 00:06:39,342
Her GFR is in normal range.

151
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:41,677
Well, that would make it unlikely,
but not impossible.

152
00:06:41,745 --> 00:06:44,447
It'd also explain why her prescribed
hypertension meds weren't working

153
00:06:44,515 --> 00:06:46,549
and why she got better when
you gave her that ACE inhibitor.

154
00:06:46,617 --> 00:06:48,618
Mmm. Simpler explanation,
she's not taking her meds.

155
00:06:48,685 --> 00:06:49,986
Valve looks normal.

156
00:06:50,054 --> 00:06:51,921
Should I move on to
the two-chamber view?

157
00:06:51,989 --> 00:06:53,222
Yeah.

158
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,358
We have no reason to
think that she's lying.

159
00:06:55,426 --> 00:06:57,527
She seems to be telling
the truth about her pot usage.

160
00:06:57,594 --> 00:06:59,529
No THC in her blood or urine.

161
00:06:59,596 --> 00:07:02,131
She couldn't possibly be
lying about something else.

162
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:04,067
The left ventricle is thickened,

163
00:07:04,134 --> 00:07:06,502
which is consistent with
untreated hypertension.

164
00:07:08,072 --> 00:07:09,767
Heart rate's climbing.

165
00:07:10,808 --> 00:07:12,475
Cardiac output is dropping.

166
00:07:12,543 --> 00:07:13,843
Stroke volume as well.

167
00:07:13,911 --> 00:07:15,378
She's in cardiogenic shock.

168
00:07:19,149 --> 00:07:21,571
Would you mind if I did an
ultrasound on your abdomen?

169
00:07:21,885 --> 00:07:23,486
For a brain tumor?

170
00:07:23,554 --> 00:07:27,056
This is my fiance, Eli Simpson.

171
00:07:27,124 --> 00:07:28,324
When I heard about the new scans,

172
00:07:28,392 --> 00:07:30,121
I kind of stormed the castle.

173
00:07:30,661 --> 00:07:31,998
My hero.

174
00:07:32,763 --> 00:07:34,363
Your prolactin levels are very high,

175
00:07:34,431 --> 00:07:35,565
which might be caused by the tumor,

176
00:07:35,632 --> 00:07:37,433
unless another condition
raised your prolactin,

177
00:07:37,501 --> 00:07:39,088
encouraging more growth.

178
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,966
What condition boosts prolactin?

179
00:07:42,873 --> 00:07:44,844
Do you think I'm pregnant?

180
00:07:45,463 --> 00:07:48,277
He can't be. He's on testosterone.

181
00:07:48,345 --> 00:07:50,213
Except for a few weeks last month.

182
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,310
I forgot to take my shot
before our trip.

183
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,450
But there's no way that...

184
00:07:54,485 --> 00:07:55,813
You're pregnant.

185
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,206
You went into cardiogenic shock

186
00:08:11,274 --> 00:08:13,242
because your heart
wasn't pumping adequately.

187
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:16,545
We did a minor procedure
and installed an Impella pump,

188
00:08:16,613 --> 00:08:18,614
but it's a short-term solution.

189
00:08:18,681 --> 00:08:20,415
I do feel a little out of breath.

190
00:08:20,483 --> 00:08:22,851
But that might be just 'cause of you,
Dr. Andrews.

191
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,486
Ms. Norton,
I'm a married man and your doctor.

192
00:08:27,023 --> 00:08:28,390
You have a rare condition.

193
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,192
Certain parts of your heart muscle

194
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,194
have become abnormally thick.

195
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:35,631
So, this wall in between the chambers,
that's the septum.

196
00:08:35,698 --> 00:08:37,096
That's a normal one.

197
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:40,224
This is what yours looks like.

198
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:41,403
Oh, wow.

199
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,438
It's gonna require surgery.

200
00:08:43,506 --> 00:08:46,130
We're gonna run a few more tests
to determine the best approach.

201
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,258
Wait. You gonna be
my surgeon, Dr. Andrews?

202
00:08:49,512 --> 00:08:50,718
I sure will.

203
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,262
And y'all two gonna be with him?

204
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:54,950
Yeah.

205
00:08:55,018 --> 00:08:57,319
My lucky day.

206
00:08:57,387 --> 00:08:59,955
Three doctors of color
taking care of me.

207
00:09:00,023 --> 00:09:02,224
Doctors who won't talk down to me.

208
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,559
Not exactly what I'm used to.

209
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:05,894
You guys know what I mean.

210
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,596
My mother made me wear a suit and tie

211
00:09:07,664 --> 00:09:10,065
whenever we went to the pediatrician.

212
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:13,302
Put on your Sunday best just to
get on the scale and touch your toes.

213
00:09:13,369 --> 00:09:16,844
Yeah. Made me so mad,
I wound up becoming a doctor.

214
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,742
The testing confirmed

215
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,494
your tumor is a
hormone-producing prolactinoma.

216
00:09:23,573 --> 00:09:26,448
And the pregnancy is
about six weeks along.

217
00:09:26,516 --> 00:09:28,881
Do you consider yourself gay?

218
00:09:30,186 --> 00:09:32,093
- I don't think that's...
- Yes.

219
00:09:32,588 --> 00:09:34,990
Because I am gay.

220
00:09:35,058 --> 00:09:38,026
But you have vaginal
intercourse with your fiance.

221
00:09:38,094 --> 00:09:41,029
- That is how he got pregnant...
- Dr. Murphy, that's enough.

222
00:09:41,097 --> 00:09:42,954
- I... I just want...
- I think you should leave.

223
00:09:52,075 --> 00:09:53,342
I'm sorry.

224
00:09:53,409 --> 00:09:56,159
That was completely inappropriate.

225
00:09:57,447 --> 00:09:58,981
Our treatment plan for your tumor

226
00:09:59,048 --> 00:10:01,289
depends on your plan for your pregnancy.

227
00:10:01,918 --> 00:10:03,012
So...

228
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,724
We've talked about kids,

229
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:12,383
but I always figured that
was way down the road.

230
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,303
And not this way.

231
00:10:16,065 --> 00:10:17,722
I always assumed we'd adopt.

232
00:10:20,236 --> 00:10:23,311
I'd have go off T, and stay off.

233
00:10:24,607 --> 00:10:26,772
If Rio doesn't continue the pregnancy,

234
00:10:27,276 --> 00:10:28,566
then what happens?

235
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,545
Your hormone levels would drop quickly,

236
00:10:30,613 --> 00:10:32,381
which would cause the tumor to shrink.

237
00:10:32,448 --> 00:10:36,115
After that, we'd use medication,
possibly a minor surgery.

238
00:10:38,788 --> 00:10:40,536
I'd like to terminate the pregnancy.

239
00:10:43,659 --> 00:10:45,527
I looked over all of Zara's labs.

240
00:10:45,595 --> 00:10:49,264
All signs point to her taking her
hypertension medicine regularly.

241
00:10:49,332 --> 00:10:53,635
Her MRIs show significant
ventricular septal thickness,

242
00:10:53,703 --> 00:10:55,259
bad turbulence jet flow.

243
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,221
There's myocardial edema, too.

244
00:10:59,142 --> 00:11:01,877
The ACE inhibitors were a bad call.

245
00:11:01,944 --> 00:11:04,810
Which eventually sent our
patient into cardiogenic shock.

246
00:11:08,184 --> 00:11:10,316
Why'd you ignore
what she was telling us?

247
00:11:11,287 --> 00:11:12,821
I made a medical diagnosis

248
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:15,223
based on pattern processing

249
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,558
that we're taught in med school,

250
00:11:16,626 --> 00:11:21,430
which involves considering,
you know, race, education,

251
00:11:21,497 --> 00:11:24,199
occupation, BMI.

252
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,415
Always sounded like profiling to me.

253
00:11:33,643 --> 00:11:35,277
<i>Yes, we have the rain,</i>

254
00:11:35,344 --> 00:11:37,145
<i>but more impressively, the wind.</i>

255
00:11:37,213 --> 00:11:38,947
<i>That rain's going to be
coming in sideways.</i>

256
00:11:39,015 --> 00:11:41,216
Just take a look at
how the wind increases

257
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:42,751
as we progress throughout the day.

258
00:11:42,819 --> 00:11:44,386
So, this afternoon, we're talking about

259
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:45,987
50-mile-per-hour gusts possible.

260
00:11:46,055 --> 00:11:47,520
Sorry for crashing.

261
00:11:47,857 --> 00:11:49,424
Radiology doesn't have a TV.

262
00:11:51,894 --> 00:11:53,734
You like The Weather Channel?

263
00:11:55,064 --> 00:11:56,821
I find it soothing.

264
00:11:58,434 --> 00:11:59,782
Would you like to join me?

265
00:12:01,473 --> 00:12:04,041
And we have more intense
rainfall coming through,

266
00:12:04,109 --> 00:12:06,644
and that's going to also
lead to some flood potential.

267
00:12:06,711 --> 00:12:08,379
All of us are going
to get into the action.

268
00:12:08,446 --> 00:12:09,980
You got the mountains.

269
00:12:10,048 --> 00:12:13,306
Would you mind if I lowered
the volume by four output levels?

270
00:12:14,386 --> 00:12:15,386
Oh.

271
00:12:16,421 --> 00:12:17,855
That would be perfect.

272
00:12:17,923 --> 00:12:19,957
<i>All the areas around here
in Northern California,</i>

273
00:12:20,025 --> 00:12:21,626
<i>Modesto, Stockton, Sacramento.</i>

274
00:12:21,693 --> 00:12:23,628
<i>The
northern part of San Francisco...</i>

275
00:12:32,437 --> 00:12:35,312
I find the reflection on
the screen so distracting.

276
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,524
So do I.

277
00:12:51,723 --> 00:12:52,723
Could I

278
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,541
do this?

279
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:42,212
Nurse paged me.

280
00:13:44,443 --> 00:13:45,799
Is something wrong?

281
00:13:47,112 --> 00:13:48,468
I've changed my mind.

282
00:13:51,316 --> 00:13:52,764
I want to keep the baby.

283
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,388
Since you are continuing the pregnancy,

284
00:13:59,455 --> 00:14:01,931
we'll need to surgically
remove the prolactinoma.

285
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,684
So, you'll cut into his brain?

286
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,806
Our safest option is to go
in through the nasal cavity

287
00:14:07,831 --> 00:14:10,999
in what's known as a
transsphenoidal surgery, TSS for short.

288
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:14,402
It's less invasive
than our other option.

289
00:14:14,837 --> 00:14:16,754
That still sounds dangerous.

290
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:18,406
I've made up my mind.

291
00:14:18,474 --> 00:14:20,424
Do I get any say in this?

292
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:25,647
I'm all for us having a family,
but I'm not ready to...

293
00:14:25,715 --> 00:14:27,582
No one's ever ready for kids.

294
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:30,285
Yesterday, you said that you
never considered getting pregnant,

295
00:14:30,353 --> 00:14:32,895
and now you're willing
to risk your life for it.

296
00:14:36,592 --> 00:14:38,234
When I was about seven,

297
00:14:39,095 --> 00:14:41,529
I had this one refuge.

298
00:14:43,232 --> 00:14:45,500
I'd hang a quilt over a couple chairs

299
00:14:45,568 --> 00:14:48,619
and hide out with my two buds,

300
00:14:49,705 --> 00:14:51,956
Foxie the Fox and Fuzz the Lion,

301
00:14:53,075 --> 00:14:54,416
and I'd imagine,

302
00:14:55,111 --> 00:14:56,460
I was the dad.

303
00:14:59,297 --> 00:15:02,056
And they were my twin little guys,

304
00:15:02,685 --> 00:15:04,718
fraternal, obviously.

305
00:15:06,189 --> 00:15:07,596
We were a family.

306
00:15:10,311 --> 00:15:13,320
When I transitioned,
I put that dream aside.

307
00:15:14,297 --> 00:15:16,498
At least, as far as them coming from me.

308
00:15:16,566 --> 00:15:17,566
But now...

309
00:15:21,704 --> 00:15:23,362
Whether we planned it or not,

310
00:15:24,307 --> 00:15:25,407
this is our baby.

311
00:15:32,048 --> 00:15:34,049
How soon can you do the surgery?

312
00:15:34,116 --> 00:15:36,917
I'll order an image-guidance
MRI to get things started.

313
00:15:46,128 --> 00:15:48,830
Based on the
cardiac MRI and catheterization,

314
00:15:48,898 --> 00:15:50,532
there are two treatment options.

315
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,034
Myectomy, basically open heart surgery,

316
00:15:53,109 --> 00:15:55,544
and alcohol septal ablation,

317
00:15:55,605 --> 00:15:59,440
where we use the alcohol to kill
targeted sections of the heart muscle.

318
00:15:59,942 --> 00:16:02,077
Well, what would you recommend?

319
00:16:02,151 --> 00:16:05,520
The surgery is more invasive,
tougher recovery,

320
00:16:05,581 --> 00:16:07,415
but better efficacy long-term.

321
00:16:07,483 --> 00:16:09,618
The ablation is less dangerous,

322
00:16:09,685 --> 00:16:13,579
but you're more likely to need
further medical interventions.

323
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:15,590
Now, you call that a recommendation?

324
00:16:15,658 --> 00:16:17,859
There are pros and cons to both.

325
00:16:17,927 --> 00:16:19,861
Uh, you'll need to weigh them.

326
00:16:19,929 --> 00:16:21,587
I'll give you some time.

327
00:16:22,331 --> 00:16:24,299
You always want to take care of people,
Dr. Browne?

328
00:16:24,367 --> 00:16:25,507
Pretty much.

329
00:16:26,467 --> 00:16:27,969
Me, too.

330
00:16:28,037 --> 00:16:30,939
Oh. Well, you run
a marijuana dispensary.

331
00:16:31,007 --> 00:16:32,974
It's not all about getting people high.

332
00:16:33,042 --> 00:16:36,645
No, maybe not, but I'm
guessing most of your clientele...

333
00:16:36,712 --> 00:16:39,313
My Great-Aunt Lucy
had pancreatic cancer.

334
00:16:41,517 --> 00:16:43,067
A year, she hung on.

335
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,277
In agony.

336
00:16:46,622 --> 00:16:50,225
Marijuana was the only thing
that helped her eat or sleep.

337
00:16:50,293 --> 00:16:52,368
Doctors didn't give her
anything for the pain?

338
00:16:52,728 --> 00:16:54,620
They suggested ibuprofen.

339
00:16:56,132 --> 00:16:58,099
Now, you know doctors
are 22% less likely

340
00:16:58,167 --> 00:17:00,135
to give pain meds to Black patients

341
00:17:00,202 --> 00:17:02,962
than to white patients
with the same symptoms.

342
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:07,383
My point is, you and I,
we're a lot alike.

343
00:17:08,285 --> 00:17:10,645
We're both strong, Black women
finding our way in the world,

344
00:17:10,713 --> 00:17:13,815
but one of us knows more
about medicine than the other.

345
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:18,143
So, I'd like to know,
what would you do in my situation?

346
00:17:22,191 --> 00:17:24,426
The open myectomy is a bigger risk

347
00:17:24,493 --> 00:17:27,653
but offers more long-term benefits.

348
00:17:29,565 --> 00:17:31,323
I've made my decision.

349
00:17:33,836 --> 00:17:35,494
I'm with you, Dr. Browne.

350
00:17:36,339 --> 00:17:37,955
Book the myectomy.

351
00:17:45,614 --> 00:17:48,316
Here's the Rio Gutierrez
imaging for your upcoming TSS.

352
00:17:48,384 --> 00:17:50,592
Set that on the table, please.

353
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,957
I, um...

354
00:17:56,025 --> 00:17:58,226
I noted the tumor's
suprasellar expansion

355
00:17:58,294 --> 00:18:01,629
and surrounding edema
and splaying of circle of Willis.

356
00:18:01,697 --> 00:18:03,856
That is very helpful.

357
00:18:06,702 --> 00:18:07,985
Bye, Dr. Murphy.

358
00:18:11,207 --> 00:18:12,707
You're safe, Shaun. She's gone.

359
00:18:12,775 --> 00:18:14,366
Not really.

360
00:18:15,211 --> 00:18:17,245
Dr. D'Souza is still in my brain.

361
00:18:17,313 --> 00:18:18,579
I don't like it.

362
00:18:19,115 --> 00:18:20,539
We kissed.

363
00:18:21,384 --> 00:18:22,517
- When?
- What?

364
00:18:22,585 --> 00:18:24,586
I have so many thoughts about her,

365
00:18:24,653 --> 00:18:27,088
and I have so many
questions I want to ask Rio.

366
00:18:27,156 --> 00:18:28,656
Wouldn't he get more pleasure for...

367
00:18:28,724 --> 00:18:30,058
Questions you're not
supposed to ask him.

368
00:18:30,126 --> 00:18:31,626
The kiss, Shaun. When did you kiss?

369
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:33,927
Last night. In my dream.

370
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:39,100
If I can't ask questions,
how do I understand?

371
00:18:39,168 --> 00:18:41,102
My... My brain...

372
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:44,205
My... My brain isn't behaving
the way I want it to.

373
00:18:44,273 --> 00:18:45,856
How do I make it stop?

374
00:18:49,812 --> 00:18:51,904
You're attracted to Dr. D'Souza.

375
00:18:52,348 --> 00:18:53,739
Why does that bother you?

376
00:18:55,985 --> 00:19:00,622
When I was with Carly
and had feelings for Lea,

377
00:19:00,689 --> 00:19:03,391
it meant I was supposed to be with Lea.

378
00:19:03,459 --> 00:19:06,094
What if this means I'm
supposed to be with Dr. D'Souza?

379
00:19:06,162 --> 00:19:08,630
No. You've loved Lea for years.

380
00:19:08,697 --> 00:19:12,049
This is just... attraction.

381
00:19:13,135 --> 00:19:16,929
But shouldn't loving Lea
make it go away?

382
00:19:18,207 --> 00:19:21,725
Relationships would be a
lot easier if it worked that way.

383
00:19:23,084 --> 00:19:24,517
You're feeling guilty.

384
00:19:24,542 --> 00:19:27,760
I say take Lea out for a nice dinner,
something special.

385
00:19:27,817 --> 00:19:30,118
And tell her about my crush.

386
00:19:30,186 --> 00:19:31,753
I need to let Lea know.

387
00:19:31,821 --> 00:19:33,278
- No, definitely not.
- No, you do not.

388
00:19:34,723 --> 00:19:37,125
I want to get your thoughts on the
suprasellar extension of the tumor

389
00:19:37,193 --> 00:19:38,560
- for this TSS.
- You remember Sarah Pepper?

390
00:19:38,627 --> 00:19:40,095
Runs nephrology at S.F. Regional?

391
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,497
Always wears a shawl?

392
00:19:42,565 --> 00:19:46,067
So, during the staff meeting last week,
she fell apart.

393
00:19:46,135 --> 00:19:49,019
Screaming, crying in front of the
whole department. Totally nuts.

394
00:19:49,205 --> 00:19:51,639
Rough day at the office.

395
00:19:51,707 --> 00:19:54,383
Wonder how you'd approach and
resect without getting a CSF leak.

396
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,349
Yeah.

397
00:19:56,374 --> 00:19:59,471
Place a lumbar drain, then infuse
saline and do Valsalva maneuver.

398
00:19:59,496 --> 00:20:00,863
Okay.

399
00:20:00,888 --> 00:20:03,637
Apparently,
Pepper's meltdown was so over the top,

400
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,936
the hospital forced her to take a leave.

401
00:20:06,597 --> 00:20:08,981
- How long?
- Unspecified.

402
00:20:09,433 --> 00:20:11,935
She's always been a little crazy.

403
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:15,305
Last I checked, eccentric and
emotional didn't qualify as crazy.

404
00:20:15,373 --> 00:20:17,114
Thanks for taking a look.

405
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,447
I read that cisgender people

406
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:27,417
often reduce transgender
people to their genitalia,

407
00:20:27,485 --> 00:20:29,042
and that that is offensive.

408
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:32,054
Did I do that to you and Rio?

409
00:20:32,456 --> 00:20:33,972
Yes.

410
00:20:35,105 --> 00:20:36,383
I'm sorry.

411
00:20:39,063 --> 00:20:42,014
Rio will be going into surgery soon.

412
00:20:43,371 --> 00:20:45,272
He's been asking for you.

413
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,269
You haven't been answering your phone.

414
00:20:47,775 --> 00:20:49,188
Thanks for letting me know.

415
00:20:53,715 --> 00:20:56,049
He is very confusing to me, too.

416
00:20:56,117 --> 00:20:58,452
Rio has worked so hard,

417
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:01,288
he had a bilateral
subcutaneous mastectomy

418
00:21:01,356 --> 00:21:03,056
and takes hormone replacement therapy,

419
00:21:03,124 --> 00:21:08,540
but now he is choosing
the most female act.

420
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:12,961
It's not female if Rio's doing it.

421
00:21:16,604 --> 00:21:18,839
Y... Yes.

422
00:21:18,906 --> 00:21:22,054
And he must have dealt
with a lot of prejudice

423
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,777
during his transition.

424
00:21:23,845 --> 00:21:25,679
I dealt with prejudice.

425
00:21:25,747 --> 00:21:27,976
My brother helped me.
Does he have a brother?

426
00:21:29,504 --> 00:21:31,341
His family doesn't talk to him.

427
00:21:36,591 --> 00:21:40,113
And now Rio is having brain surgery.

428
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:44,284
He is very brave.

429
00:21:45,566 --> 00:21:46,600
You can stay here.

430
00:21:51,739 --> 00:21:54,741
I have a patient, Zara Norton.

431
00:21:54,809 --> 00:21:56,910
We, uh... We diagnosed her with HOCM.

432
00:21:56,978 --> 00:21:58,645
I saw the file.

433
00:21:58,713 --> 00:22:01,381
Dr. Guerin expressed some concerns

434
00:22:01,449 --> 00:22:04,763
about my initial handling
of the case in the ER.

435
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:09,727
He thinks I stereotyped her,
based on her race.

436
00:22:10,224 --> 00:22:11,353
Do you think you did?

437
00:22:13,127 --> 00:22:14,661
She was crashing.

438
00:22:14,729 --> 00:22:17,609
I had to make a call. I
didn't have a lot to go on.

439
00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:21,621
Glassman came to see me this morning.

440
00:22:22,437 --> 00:22:24,938
Someone told him I'm
unstable and need help.

441
00:22:25,006 --> 00:22:26,410
Any idea where he heard that?

442
00:22:28,643 --> 00:22:29,976
I asked for help. You can, too.

443
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,308
You're a resident. No
one cares if you need help.

444
00:22:33,281 --> 00:22:35,382
I got this job in part

445
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:39,186
because my main competition,
a man, backed me.

446
00:22:39,253 --> 00:22:41,722
The second anyone thinks
I can't handle this...

447
00:22:41,789 --> 00:22:42,889
No one is gonna think that...

448
00:22:42,957 --> 00:22:44,636
They will if you keep
telling them I'm a mess.

449
00:22:44,892 --> 00:22:47,094
You have PTSD.

450
00:22:47,161 --> 00:22:48,695
You shouldn't be ashamed.

451
00:22:48,763 --> 00:22:51,852
Says the women who just
profiled a Black female patient.

452
00:22:54,135 --> 00:22:55,522
You judged her,

453
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:58,572
just like people will judge me

454
00:22:58,639 --> 00:23:00,707
and whisper that I've always
been a little intense,

455
00:23:00,775 --> 00:23:02,946
so no wonder I was asked to step down.

456
00:23:07,582 --> 00:23:08,952
Nobody needs to know.

457
00:23:11,652 --> 00:23:12,652
Exactly.

458
00:23:14,989 --> 00:23:16,890
You tell me that it doesn't matter.

459
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:18,959
You tell me everyone will understand,

460
00:23:19,026 --> 00:23:21,361
and then you tell me
to keep it to myself.

461
00:23:21,429 --> 00:23:23,425
Should I be ashamed, or shouldn't I be?

462
00:23:24,786 --> 00:23:28,000
All right, Ms. Norton,
time to head to pre-op.

463
00:23:30,295 --> 00:23:31,872
What's in the bag, handsome?

464
00:23:31,939 --> 00:23:35,163
I like to know what goes into my body.

465
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:38,366
Uh, cefazolin. It's a prophylactic
antibiotic we give before surgeries.

466
00:23:38,434 --> 00:23:39,762
Makes sense.

467
00:23:41,303 --> 00:23:44,240
Hey, what was the med y'all gave
me when I first got here to the ER?

468
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,375
Enalaprilat. It's an ACE inhibitor.

469
00:23:47,443 --> 00:23:48,986
Isn't that for hypertension?

470
00:23:49,213 --> 00:23:49,974
Mmm-hmm.

471
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:52,931
But I thought I already told y'all

472
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:54,762
I was on meds for my blood pressure.

473
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:56,735
You did.

474
00:23:56,803 --> 00:23:58,307
So, you figured I needed more?

475
00:24:01,741 --> 00:24:03,354
Or did you not believe me?

476
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,369
I'm sorry.

477
00:24:21,995 --> 00:24:23,248
You must be scared.

478
00:24:24,664 --> 00:24:26,543
You shouldn't have to be scared alone.

479
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:29,735
I love you.

480
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:32,049
I love you, too.

481
00:24:36,743 --> 00:24:37,743
Eli.

482
00:24:40,046 --> 00:24:41,513
I can't see you.

483
00:24:41,581 --> 00:24:44,183
I'm right here, babe.

484
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,355
Can you follow this with your eyes?

485
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:50,422
It keeps disappearing.

486
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:51,657
You've lost peripheral vision.

487
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:53,692
The tumor is impinging
on the optic fibers.

488
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,131
We can't perform the TSS surgery.

489
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:03,734
With the tumor's continued growth,

490
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:07,437
the best remaining option is
the open pterional craniotomy.

491
00:25:07,513 --> 00:25:10,949
But it is higher risk
with a lengthier recovery.

492
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,844
All of which is on top of the
potential for gender dysphoria

493
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:15,179
during pregnancy.

494
00:25:15,246 --> 00:25:17,541
Is that still a concern?

495
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:21,373
I think back to before
I started taking T,

496
00:25:22,253 --> 00:25:23,959
how terrible that felt.

497
00:25:26,431 --> 00:25:28,964
The thought of feeling
that all over again...

498
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:35,012
We could go back to the original plan.

499
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:38,569
You mean terminate the pregnancy?

500
00:25:40,104 --> 00:25:42,311
The tumor should shrink on its own.

501
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:49,568
After everything you've done
to get where you are in your life,

502
00:25:49,874 --> 00:25:53,197
it's scary to think about doing
something that would put that at risk.

503
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:58,869
This is my next step.

504
00:26:00,098 --> 00:26:03,290
I'm ready to take it,
even if I'm scared.

505
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:08,212
You have to take risks
sometimes, Dr. Lim.

506
00:26:17,988 --> 00:26:19,223
Thank you.

507
00:26:19,747 --> 00:26:21,581
Shouldn't you be
prepping Zara for surgery?

508
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,347
It's canceled.

509
00:26:23,414 --> 00:26:25,604
She wants to be transferred
to a different hospital.

510
00:26:27,405 --> 00:26:30,818
One where she won't be
"racially profiled into heart failure."

511
00:26:39,163 --> 00:26:41,870
Shaun, you okay?

512
00:26:44,588 --> 00:26:47,290
I am having
thoughts I don't want to have.

513
00:26:47,324 --> 00:26:50,254
Both Park and Jordan
say I shouldn't tell you.

514
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:53,340
But you're going to, aren't you?

515
00:26:55,446 --> 00:26:56,947
Yes, I am.

516
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:58,882
I have a work crush.

517
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,285
Also, my patient is
a pregnant trans man...

518
00:27:01,352 --> 00:27:02,725
Okay, one at a time, Shaun.

519
00:27:03,087 --> 00:27:05,956
About this... crush?

520
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:07,658
Her name is Dr. Cintia D'Souza.

521
00:27:07,725 --> 00:27:09,660
She is a second-year radiology resident.

522
00:27:09,727 --> 00:27:11,895
Last night, I dreamed we
were in the Residents' Lounge,

523
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:14,097
watching The Weather Channel,
and then we started kissing...

524
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:15,165
Okay, I got it.

525
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:19,036
Are you mad?

526
00:27:19,103 --> 00:27:21,326
Park and Jordan were right.
I shouldn't have told you.

527
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:24,508
No. I'm not mad.

528
00:27:24,575 --> 00:27:28,208
A little surprised, but that's okay.

529
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:32,755
I'm still attracted

530
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:34,757
to other guys sometimes.

531
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:36,553
N... No.

532
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:38,956
No. What? Who?

533
00:27:39,023 --> 00:27:40,262
- It doesn't matter.
- Who?

534
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:45,395
There... Okay, there is
this one physical therapist...

535
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:46,463
N... No.

536
00:27:47,211 --> 00:27:48,211
No.

537
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,399
No.

538
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:57,040
What if we're attracted to other people

539
00:27:57,108 --> 00:28:00,574
because there is something
wrong with our relationship?

540
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:05,315
You're not planning on
kissing Dr. D'Souza in real life?

541
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:06,450
No.

542
00:28:06,517 --> 00:28:08,452
Or working late with her,

543
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:10,787
doing some X-rays alone,

544
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:14,057
where you might end up
leaning over the same light box.

545
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:16,799
We don't use light boxes anymore.

546
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:23,380
And I don't plan to work late with her.

547
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:26,892
Then I don't think either of us
has anything to be worried about.

548
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,824
I have to go prep for
a pterional craniotomy.

549
00:28:48,726 --> 00:28:51,250
I'm Dr. Glassman,
president of the hospital.

550
00:28:52,296 --> 00:28:54,131
Unless you're here to
drive me to S.F. Regional,

551
00:28:54,198 --> 00:28:55,796
you can head right back on out.

552
00:28:57,188 --> 00:29:00,523
I apologize for your experience
in the emergency room.

553
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:02,105
That's mighty white of you.

554
00:29:05,576 --> 00:29:08,512
I don't recommend that you
transfer to S.F. Regional,

555
00:29:08,579 --> 00:29:10,113
or any other hospital, for that matter.

556
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:12,369
I'm sure they got
the same fancy equipment,

557
00:29:12,446 --> 00:29:14,818
same shiny sets of
diplomas y'all got here,

558
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:17,276
and maybe a few less racist doctors.

559
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:21,458
Well, apparently,
that doesn't seem to be the case.

560
00:29:21,592 --> 00:29:25,617
I pulled data on comparable
hospitals within 100 miles,

561
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:29,533
did numbers on surgical outcomes

562
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,104
and patient satisfaction,
aggregated by race.

563
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:38,422
Apparently, we're doing well,
comparatively.

564
00:29:41,665 --> 00:29:44,834
Your argument is that your
hospital may be racially biased,

565
00:29:44,859 --> 00:29:47,764
but it's less racially biased
than these other hospitals?

566
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,851
Yeah. Pretty much.

567
00:29:51,917 --> 00:29:53,471
Stay at St. Bonaventure,

568
00:29:53,496 --> 00:29:57,587
the president of the hospital will
monitor your care every step of the way.

569
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,193
For whatever it's worth,

570
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,113
I don't think you can
do better than that.

571
00:30:13,544 --> 00:30:15,834
She's gonna stay, on one condition.

572
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,587
That you're off the team.

573
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:31,654
Dr. Park, please open Sylvian fissure.

574
00:30:31,722 --> 00:30:33,498
Arachnoid
knife and Rhoton dissector.

575
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,428
Tumor is visible.

576
00:30:39,529 --> 00:30:41,181
What makes someone a man?

577
00:30:43,242 --> 00:30:45,744
I thought it was just the chromosomes,

578
00:30:45,811 --> 00:30:47,512
but that must not be it,

579
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:50,515
which makes things
confusing and difficult,

580
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:52,317
and I know Rio was
uncomfortable when he...

581
00:30:52,384 --> 00:30:54,477
Life is uncomfortable.

582
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:57,713
It hits you with tough situations
and you muscle through them.

583
00:30:57,781 --> 00:30:59,901
I see a tiny bleed
in the circular sinus.

584
00:30:59,926 --> 00:31:01,620
Pack it with Floseal.

585
00:31:07,724 --> 00:31:09,692
Someone give me an update.

586
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,694
We got a drop in
end tidal CO2 and oxygen sat.

587
00:31:11,762 --> 00:31:13,596
See any evidence
of exposed air cells?

588
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:17,366
No. But waxing bone
edges just to be safe.

589
00:31:17,434 --> 00:31:21,237
But the tumor thinned the
sellar floor and sphenoid wall.

590
00:31:21,305 --> 00:31:23,808
Making it permeable to oxygen.

591
00:31:24,675 --> 00:31:26,209
It's an air embolism.

592
00:31:27,901 --> 00:31:29,188
BP's dropping.

593
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:33,818
Dr. Lim, what should we do?

594
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,832
Saline gauze,

595
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:00,476
tilt the table to eliminate the
negative air pressure gradient,

596
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:01,987
and place a central line.

597
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:04,563
This will stop the air leak

598
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:06,465
and allow us to access the air bubble.

599
00:32:06,533 --> 00:32:09,078
Inserting
Bunegin air-aspirating cath.

600
00:32:10,836 --> 00:32:13,718
You are 2 centimeters
from the superior vena cava.

601
00:32:14,883 --> 00:32:17,978
Aspirate the right atrium until
you don't see any more air bubbles.

602
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:30,516
Nice save, Dr. Lim.

603
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,809
Let's get this tumor out.

604
00:32:33,268 --> 00:32:35,509
<i>Make your transverse
aortotomy with Potts scissors,</i>

605
00:32:35,533 --> 00:32:36,580
<i>Dr. Wolke.</i>

606
00:32:37,939 --> 00:32:41,234
<i>Extending the muscular
incision down to the mid-ventricle.</i>

607
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:43,320
There's the myectomy site.

608
00:32:44,646 --> 00:32:46,698
There's the aberrant muscle bundle.

609
00:33:11,382 --> 00:33:12,769
Get her off bypass,

610
00:33:12,974 --> 00:33:14,251
see how she does.

611
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:28,724
How's the cardiac output?

612
00:33:29,891 --> 00:33:31,560
Reduced and insufficient.

613
00:33:32,694 --> 00:33:36,030
Low output could mean we
need to further reduce the septum.

614
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,865
Unless it means that
we reduced it too much.

615
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:39,466
Damaged the cardiac
electrical conductors

616
00:33:39,534 --> 00:33:40,994
that control the heart rate.

617
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,763
She's having third-degree heart block.

618
00:33:42,988 --> 00:33:44,164
Enrique's right.

619
00:33:44,823 --> 00:33:46,375
We took too much muscle.

620
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:48,392
Put her back on bypass.

621
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,728
We could augment the
wall with a bovine patch.

622
00:33:50,811 --> 00:33:52,298
Still wouldn't insulate
the electrical system.

623
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:55,759
She'd still be at risk of complete
heart block and cardiac arrest.

624
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,672
<i>We could insert
a dual chamber pacer.</i>

625
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,251
She won't need the conduction
system in the wall of her heart

626
00:34:04,276 --> 00:34:05,911
to control her heart rate.

627
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:09,146
Let's go!

628
00:34:14,853 --> 00:34:16,405
How was the craniotomy?

629
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:17,988
It went well.

630
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,825
The patient is in recovery.

631
00:34:22,928 --> 00:34:25,429
Your text said you have good news.

632
00:34:25,497 --> 00:34:27,666
And by good news, I mean
bad news for Dr. D'Souza.

633
00:34:27,866 --> 00:34:30,836
Plenty of great stuff to crush a crush.

634
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:32,671
First observation,

635
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:35,591
she smells like cinnamon.

636
00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:37,534
Mmm.

637
00:34:39,144 --> 00:34:41,879
Which is more puzzling than irritating.

638
00:34:41,947 --> 00:34:45,149
Actually kind of nice. Which
is obviously not helpful.

639
00:34:45,217 --> 00:34:48,252
Oh, okay. She does this
weird self-grooming gesture

640
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,522
where she tucks her hair behind her ear.

641
00:34:52,103 --> 00:34:54,291
And then sorta massages her ear.

642
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:56,493
Also n... not helpful.

643
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:58,345
Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

644
00:34:58,346 --> 00:34:59,556
Mmm-hmm.

645
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,600
Okay. At the salad bar,

646
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:05,454
she used the cucumber tongs
to reach for the cucumbers,

647
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:07,915
and then the tomatoes.

648
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:12,628
And the olives.

649
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,590
And the pickles.

650
00:35:17,983 --> 00:35:19,259
- Ugh.
- Mmm.

651
00:35:19,918 --> 00:35:20,918
Mmm-hmm.

652
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:54,026
Hey.

653
00:35:56,029 --> 00:35:57,029
Hey.

654
00:35:59,292 --> 00:36:00,719
I can see all of you.

655
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,756
How'd... How'd we do?

656
00:36:07,823 --> 00:36:11,893
Great. We got all of the mass,
vision is restored.

657
00:36:11,918 --> 00:36:14,823
You have every reason
to expect a full recovery

658
00:36:15,164 --> 00:36:17,325
and a healthy pregnancy.

659
00:36:20,036 --> 00:36:21,430
We're gonna be dads.

660
00:36:25,549 --> 00:36:26,769
Are you ready?

661
00:36:29,112 --> 00:36:31,353
I've never been a pregnant man before.

662
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:36,787
You'll always be the best
man that I've ever known.

663
00:36:50,367 --> 00:36:52,535
Came to see how you were doing.

664
00:36:52,602 --> 00:36:55,923
Dr. Andrews told me you was the
one who figured out how to save me.

665
00:37:00,477 --> 00:37:02,847
Still don't change what
went down earlier, though.

666
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,870
When I got to med school,

667
00:37:14,558 --> 00:37:15,914
people took one look at me

668
00:37:15,938 --> 00:37:17,711
and they thought they
knew exactly who I was.

669
00:37:18,595 --> 00:37:20,823
Black girl on financial aid.

670
00:37:22,399 --> 00:37:24,033
She must not be that smart.

671
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,996
She must have gotten a lot of breaks.

672
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:29,751
She'll probably need a lot more.

673
00:37:34,698 --> 00:37:35,698
And I worked...

674
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,182
I worked so hard

675
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,886
to prove them wrong,

676
00:37:42,319 --> 00:37:43,752
that I wasn't who they thought I was,

677
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:46,140
that I deserved to be there, that I...

678
00:37:46,423 --> 00:37:48,225
that I fit in.

679
00:37:53,964 --> 00:37:56,066
When you came into the ER,

680
00:37:58,668 --> 00:38:01,197
loud and messy,

681
00:38:03,173 --> 00:38:05,274
I saw...

682
00:38:05,342 --> 00:38:10,748
I saw everything I
have tried hard not to be.

683
00:38:14,463 --> 00:38:16,712
And I think it made me angry.

684
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:23,803
And I'm ashamed of that.

685
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:28,474
And I'm really sorry.

686
00:38:32,428 --> 00:38:34,104
I used to be that way.

687
00:38:37,007 --> 00:38:40,486
But I got tired of working that hard
to make white people comfortable.

688
00:38:56,359 --> 00:38:58,254
You two heading out for the night?

689
00:39:01,298 --> 00:39:02,998
We sure are.

690
00:39:03,066 --> 00:39:05,336
How did the craniotomy go, Shaun?

691
00:39:06,415 --> 00:39:08,848
Did you guys get all the prolactinoma?

692
00:39:09,952 --> 00:39:10,952
Yes.

693
00:39:12,108 --> 00:39:14,186
Is that cafeteria salad?

694
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:17,523
Are there pickles in there?

695
00:39:19,282 --> 00:39:20,349
Did you want some?

696
00:39:20,417 --> 00:39:22,785
You know, I'm good. Thank you.

697
00:39:22,852 --> 00:39:24,655
Shaun, did you...

698
00:39:25,255 --> 00:39:28,450
- No, thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

699
00:39:32,862 --> 00:39:35,764
It does help to focus on her
irresponsible salad bar practices

700
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:37,399
and dietary preferences.

701
00:39:37,467 --> 00:39:40,546
I've got a ton of strategies
to manage discomfort.

702
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:42,172
So do I.

703
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,802
- Hey.
- Hey.

704
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:49,805
To replenish your supply,

705
00:39:50,619 --> 00:39:51,961
and a peace offering.

706
00:39:52,382 --> 00:39:55,184
I wasn't aware we were at war.

707
00:39:55,251 --> 00:39:58,898
Well, seemed like my gossip
about Pepper kind of landed wrong.

708
00:40:00,357 --> 00:40:01,657
Bad day.

709
00:40:01,725 --> 00:40:03,225
Sorry to crash the party.

710
00:40:03,293 --> 00:40:06,614
Dr. Glassman wanted me
to show this to you two.

711
00:40:07,847 --> 00:40:11,000
I asked Lea to run some
numbers on various metrics by race,

712
00:40:11,067 --> 00:40:13,936
and the results are not great,

713
00:40:14,004 --> 00:40:15,838
especially when it comes
to pain management.

714
00:40:15,905 --> 00:40:19,375
We are under-treating
African-American and Latinx patients

715
00:40:19,442 --> 00:40:22,111
by a considerable margin.

716
00:40:22,178 --> 00:40:23,846
I think I need a little
of that peace offering.

717
00:40:23,913 --> 00:40:25,381
Help yourself.

718
00:40:25,448 --> 00:40:28,135
- Anyone else?
- No. Thank you.

719
00:40:29,686 --> 00:40:31,639
Uh... me, neither.

720
00:40:38,228 --> 00:40:39,228
I...

721
00:40:41,765 --> 00:40:43,776
Started taking sertraline.

722
00:40:45,235 --> 00:40:46,695
For PTSD.

723
00:40:49,205 --> 00:40:50,491
Sorry to hear that.

724
00:40:52,274 --> 00:40:53,661
You doing okay?

725
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:57,860
Not really.

726
00:40:59,676 --> 00:41:00,676
But I'm

727
00:41:01,998 --> 00:41:02,998
working on it.

728
00:41:04,474 --> 00:41:05,474
Okay.

729
00:41:09,132 --> 00:41:11,887
Dr. Browne, good work.

730
00:41:13,957 --> 00:41:14,957
Thank you.

731
00:41:42,058 --> 00:41:43,836
I apologized to Zara.

732
00:41:47,063 --> 00:41:51,135
She pointed out I spent med school

733
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:54,888
trying to make white people comfortable.

734
00:41:58,554 --> 00:41:59,554
I mean, she's right.

735
00:42:00,716 --> 00:42:02,354
It wasn't just med school.

736
00:42:04,874 --> 00:42:06,343
Exhausting, isn't it?

737
00:42:09,333 --> 00:42:10,887
But we had to do it, right?

738
00:42:12,322 --> 00:42:13,431
To be here?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
