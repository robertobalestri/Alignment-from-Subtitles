1
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:06,573
Previously on "ER.."

2
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:08,208
She's pregnant.

3
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:11,244
‐ Who?
‐ Nicole.

4
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:14,114
Oh, yeah, yeah, my stuff
just leapt into her bag.

5
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:15,448
Nicole?

6
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:17,117
You know, I used to have
a crush on you.

7
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,218
I used to have a crush
on you too.

8
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:19,753
I'm glad you came back.

9
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:21,121
Me too.

10
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:26,259
‐ Get in.
‐ No, I'm good.

11
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:27,427
No, you're not.

12
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,195
Go on, get out of here.
Come on.

13
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:31,732
‐ What was that about?
‐ I'm being subpoenaed.

14
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:33,800
'For what case?'

15
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:35,736
Reese. Roger's suing
for custody.

16
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:42,475
'He drew this?'

17
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,745
Yesterday afternoon.

18
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:46,747
He's got talent,
don't you think?

19
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:50,450
Hey, Jackie.

20
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:52,553
Hey.

21
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:53,587
Thanks for dropping
him off.

22
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,621
No problem.

23
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:57,123
Hey.

24
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:59,325
I missed you last night.

25
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:01,828
I know.

26
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:03,263
I had to work late.

27
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,700
No, no, no, I can't play.

28
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:11,437
I'm gonna come back
and put you to sleep.

29
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:14,340
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yeah?

30
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:17,110
Dr. Benton,
Romano wants you to assist

31
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:18,378
on a post‐op colectomy.

32
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,546
I'm off at 8:00.

33
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,881
It's 7:55.

34
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,082
Call Edson.

35
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:25,318
Oh, damn it.

36
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:26,486
'What is it?'

37
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,655
Uh, it's the ER.

38
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:31,157
I thought of something,
remember how Carla wanted Reese

39
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:33,393
to be with you on Father's Day?
It says a lot.

40
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,729
‐ The judge should know.
‐ That's good. Yeah.

41
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,831
‐ We'll be okay, right?
‐ Yeah, it's just first day.

42
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:39,132
Maybe I should be
there to help.

43
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:41,167
Jackie, you are helping.

44
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:44,370
Rachel Greene. I need a copy
of her attendance records.

45
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:46,172
‐ You could've told me.
‐ I didn't know.

46
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:47,307
Okay, I'll hold.

47
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,743
Who's allergic
to lilies?

48
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,713
She may not have appreciated
the symbolism.

49
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:55,516
‐ Symbolism?
‐ Lilies are for funerals.

50
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:58,719
Oh, God,
I'm sorry.

51
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:00,621
I just wanted to send
her some flowers.

52
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:02,455
You got his grandmother
flowers?

53
00:02:02,488 --> 00:02:03,924
I can't seem to get
in her good graces.

54
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,592
How's her leg, anyway?

55
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,427
I think she's still more
concerned with the girl she hit.

56
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,895
I already met
with the vice principal.

57
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:10,496
I thought that girl
was better.

58
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:12,566
Yeah, she's on her upswing.

59
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,434
About to have a much
bigger bank account.

60
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,402
‐ She settled?
‐ Very good offer.

61
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:18,271
Good, so you can fax it to me?

62
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,339
'Who's paging me?'

63
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:20,607
They need you in room two.

64
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,242
‐ Where's Corday?
‐ Upstairs.

65
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:24,344
‐ Isn't she on for trauma?
‐ We just got here.

66
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:25,546
I thought
she was out on leave.

67
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:27,380
She's been cleared
to operate.

68
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:29,182
What about
all the dead geezers?

69
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:31,451
You know, there's no evidence
of any wrongdoing.

70
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,620
Good news.

71
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:36,723
When the paramedics
roll me in, I'll take Romano.

72
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:38,592
Entrance left temple, no exit.

73
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:39,660
What type of gun?

74
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:41,427
Cops said a .32
at close range.

75
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:43,396
Pupils are five millimeters
and fixed.

76
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:45,231
‐ Who shot her?
‐ Does it matter?

77
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:47,200
Got caught in a gas station
holdup.

78
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:49,670
‐ Absent blink reflex.
‐ Probable brain stem damage.

79
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:52,506
‐ Alright, did we push mannitol?
‐ I'm still assessing her.

80
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:53,940
‐ What are you waiting for?
‐ We're checking for signs‐‐

81
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:55,475
Alright.
Let's push the mannitol.

82
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:56,810
Load Dilantin
and hyperventilate.

83
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,311
I was taking Gallant through‐‐

84
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,514
Why don't you treat
the patient first? Okay?

85
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:03,349
ABG, gram of Ancef
and a head CT.

86
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,218
‐ What's the GCS?
‐ Elizabeth, it's 8:20.

87
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:06,853
Sorry, I had to change.

88
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:09,489
Let's call Neurosurg if there
is something fixable on CT.

89
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:10,891
‐ What's the rush?
‐ 'I have to be somewhere.'

90
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:11,925
'Heart rate's dropped to 50.'

91
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:12,959
Push an amp of atropine.

92
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:14,494
Is there a problem, Peter?

93
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:15,529
Yeah, you're late
and I have to get

94
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:16,597
the hell out of here.

95
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,351
'What's the caloric reflex?'

96
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:12,953
Slow deviation to the stimulus.

97
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,621
And then?

98
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:15,656
Uh..

99
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:17,624
Saccadic return to the midline.

100
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:20,827
Date of birth, 9/12/73.

101
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,663
Dr. Benton ever in a good mood?

102
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:25,065
He has his moments.

103
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,367
'Go ahead.'

104
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,434
'No response.'

105
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,370
Looks like she's a donor.

106
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:32,372
I'll be right back.

107
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:34,474
Is there any other family
we can call for you?

108
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:36,042
Her‐her parents live
in Minnesota.

109
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:38,645
We were, we're gonna
drive there today.

110
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:41,347
‐ This is Dr. Corday.
‐ I'm so sorry, Mr. Pruitt.

111
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,551
Are you gonna operate?

112
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:46,019
The bullet passed
through the brain stem.

113
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:48,488
I'm afraid no surgery
can repair that.

114
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,924
Well..

115
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:56,362
...is there any chance
that she'll s‐survive?

116
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:58,298
She's no longer breathing
on her own.

117
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,003
We have to wait and see
if she regains consciousness.

118
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,606
But it's highly unlikely.

119
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,941
The medical exam is consistent
with brain death.

120
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,347
I was still asleep
when she left.

121
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:20,787
I know this is a difficult time,
but we found a donor card.

122
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,623
A‐a what?

123
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:25,425
Your wife wanted
to be an organ donor.

124
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,094
Oh, yeah, I‐I guess
that's what she wanted to..

125
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:29,930
‐ Can I go see her?
‐ Yeah, sure.

126
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:33,466
Elizabeth, we need you in here.

127
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,971
Started an 18 gage
in the left AC.

128
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:42,042
Rudy Escalona, 15 years old,
LOC from blunt head trauma.

129
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,978
One, two, three.

130
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,047
'Boxing league. He took a lot
of punches during practice.'

131
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,782
Any medical problems, Rudy?

132
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,617
Huh?

133
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:51,985
No, my son's in good shape.

134
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,587
Do you know where you are?

135
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,855
I hit him, man.

136
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:56,022
I hit him good.

137
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:57,991
Pulse ox is 98
on two liters.

138
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,492
Pupils equal and reactive.

139
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,027
Do you know what year it is?

140
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:02,462
Nobody thought I could do it.

141
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:04,598
Answer the doctor.

142
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:05,832
But I did it.

143
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,801
Squeeze my hand, Rudy.

144
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,936
‐ Haleh?
‐ He's not responding.

145
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,573
We need to get some information
from you, sir.

146
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:14,040
Airway's okay.
Still has a gag.

147
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:15,141
No, I‐I'll stay.

148
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:16,176
Uh, after the X‐rays

149
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,544
you can come back.

150
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:19,580
Abdomen soft,
no guarding or rebounds.

151
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:24,417
‐ How late are you on?
‐ Peter should be back by 6:00.

152
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,053
I'm on till 10:00.
Can you check Rachel's homework?

153
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:29,590
Sure. Lateral C‐spine
and a head CT.

154
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:31,491
She needs help
with her trinomials.

155
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:32,859
Normal Babinski.

156
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,427
I believe
I failed algebra.

157
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,597
It's either that
or the Revolutionary War.

158
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,532
I'll stick with math.

159
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:39,933
Why can't you talk
to Human Resources?

160
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,502
It won't change the outcome.

161
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:42,536
Nicole's had a tough time.

162
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:43,737
She deserves a second chance.

163
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,105
Is that your objective opinion?

164
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:46,540
Okay, she made a mistake

165
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:47,774
but I know it won't
happen again.

166
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:49,510
Look, the‐the hospital
has a zero‐tolerance

167
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:50,944
policy against stealing.

168
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:52,779
But, if you explain
the circumstances

169
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:53,814
they might reconsider‐‐

170
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:55,516
There is nothing
to explain.

171
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:56,950
Kerry, just do it
as favor to me.

172
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,051
I'm sorry, I can't.

173
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,553
Or you won't?

174
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,454
Please, I got her the job.

175
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:03,724
You should have screened
her first.

176
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,726
Carter, what is this abscess
still doing in exam four?

177
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,960
It's peri‐rectal.

178
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:08,094
Yeah, it definitely
needs surgery.

179
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:10,063
So, you're on this too, Susan?

180
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,231
Carter wanted
a second opinion.

181
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,233
No. Call Surgery, we're busy.

182
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,035
One doctor per patient.

183
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,572
Have fun suturing.

184
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,507
Have fun
with your rectum.

185
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:23,109
When was your last tetanus shot?

186
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:26,179
Uh, you better ask my dad, I..

187
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:27,781
Jorge, this is Dr. Lewis.

188
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,983
Hi. How's his exam?

189
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,519
Uh, two centimeter lac
on the labial mucosa.

190
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:35,689
I'd suggest an interrupted
4.0 vicryl.

191
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:36,957
‐ How did you get hurt?
‐ Ow.

192
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,692
He‐he was boxing.

193
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:41,061
‐ And the other guy?
‐ You tell me.

194
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:44,097
The other patient in trauma one.
Jorge's little brother, Rudy.

195
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,900
Yeah, he got in a good one,
I kind of lost it

196
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:49,503
but I didn't mean to hurt him.
Not bad.

197
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:51,204
There you are.

198
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,740
‐ How's Rudy?
‐ They say he's gonna wake up.

199
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:55,909
He's gonna be alright.
You okay?

200
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,678
He needs a couple
of stitches.

201
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:59,980
‐ Does it hurt?
‐ No.

202
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,648
This is one tough kid.

203
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:06,687
Be careful of your reaction
to the testimony.

204
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,154
No sighing, no faces.

205
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:09,222
What if I need
to ask you a question?

206
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:10,824
Write it down,
I'll address it.

207
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:12,092
Schedule change,
they switched judges on us.

208
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,527
‐ Who did we draft?
‐ Alter.

209
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,761
Is that good or bad?

210
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:15,996
Well, he always favors
the mother.

211
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:17,831
It's not a problem
in this case.

212
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,700
Even though it wouldn't hurt
to show your maternal side.

213
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,034
‐ Right.
‐ That the tie you're wearing?

214
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,603
Mm, what's wrong with it?

215
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:23,670
Well, it's a little showy,
don't you think?

216
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:28,041
And when it comes your turn,
don't get too emotional.

217
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:30,744
You don't wanna come across
as cold or unfeeling either.

218
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:32,679
You make it sound like
it's some kind of performance.

219
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:33,780
Well, it is.

220
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:36,717
That is the whitest tie
I've ever seen.

221
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,319
It's blue.

222
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,688
She's breaking out in hives.
It's like an allergic reaction.

223
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:42,723
‐ To what?
‐ I don't know.

224
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:43,957
Nobody's figured it out.

225
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,325
We've been to three ERs
this week.

226
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,727
Fifty of Benadryl
in the field.

227
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,928
Push 125 of Solu‐Medrol.

228
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:49,763
We've found guided
imagery helps.

229
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:50,997
Close your eyes, honey.

230
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,198
Who's your doctor?

231
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:53,233
Oh, he's in Syracuse.

232
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:54,601
'We're on our honeymoon.'

233
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:55,969
'Go to your peaceful place..'

234
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,341
Oh, better hide
the good silver.

235
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,576
What's she doing here?

236
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:04,110
Meeting with personnel.

237
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:06,312
I heard
she's getting fired.

238
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:09,716
Let our souls intermingle.

239
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,818
Uh, any new soaps or pesticides?

240
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:13,219
Everything's the same.

241
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:15,221
‐ What about latex?
‐ What do you mean?

242
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:17,257
Yeah, some people are allergic
to, uh, rubber gloves

243
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,592
tennis shoes, condoms..

244
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,026
‐ Condoms?
‐ We stopped using them.

245
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,327
‐ 'When?'
‐ A couple weeks ago.

246
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:23,063
We're trying to get pregnant.

247
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:25,098
Everything's alright.
Feel the warmth of the sun.

248
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:27,968
Just embrace the joy.

249
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:30,737
Rudy's vital signs
and oxygen level are good.

250
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:33,206
‐ Is he awake now?
‐ Uh, not quite yet.

251
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,108
But he might be able
to hear you.

252
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,910
‐ Go ahead.
‐ Thanks.

253
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:44,117
'Even before I married Carla,
we discussed it.'

254
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,319
I knew it would be
a challenge but..

255
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:47,888
...we agreed
that our first priority

256
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,089
would always be Reese.

257
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:50,624
You took a variety of steps

258
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:52,325
to be a good parent
to him, didn't you?

259
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,294
I learned to sign, I..

260
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,196
I've always been in contact
with his teachers.

261
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:57,664
I've been volunteering
at his school

262
00:09:57,698 --> 00:09:58,965
ever since he started.

263
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:00,967
'And you're self‐employed?'

264
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:03,036
'I run a website company
out of my home office.'

265
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:04,905
'What kind of hours
do you have?'

266
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,708
Completely flexible.
I make my own work schedule.

267
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:09,309
Have you ever needed to hire
a babysitter for Reese?

268
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:10,677
No.

269
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:11,712
Ever needed
to have someone else

270
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:12,746
pick him up from school?

271
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:13,847
No.

272
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,115
'So you've never passed'

273
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:16,917
'Reese's care‐giving
to anyone else?'

274
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,384
Never wanted to.

275
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:21,121
But Dr. Benton often requires
help, doesn't he?

276
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:23,156
Objection.
Outside his scope.

277
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:24,958
Uh, Mr. McGrath
has direct knowledge.

278
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,860
He can testify
to what he's observed.

279
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:29,029
Overruled.

280
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:32,365
Peter has a long list of people
who pick Reese up from school.

281
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:35,669
His girlfriend,
his sister, his niece.

282
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:37,203
'They're all involved
in looking after him.'

283
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:39,239
And even Dr. Benton
himself has asked you

284
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:41,074
'to help him out, hasn't he?'

285
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:42,242
Yeah.

286
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:43,944
He asked me to get Reese.

287
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,379
'But I don't mind.
Uh, I wanna be with him.'

288
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:47,881
Did Reese ever mention to you

289
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:49,415
where he prefers to sleep?

290
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:52,185
'Your house or Dr. Benton's?'

291
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:53,954
He likes my place.

292
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,288
'Why is that?'

293
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,790
He says it's his home.

294
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:00,393
Once the procurement teams
arrive

295
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:02,028
we'll move her to the OR.

296
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:03,463
She'll be on a ventilator?

297
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,098
Yes.

298
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:07,934
So her heart will
keep beating.

299
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:10,136
So she'll be alive when
you remove her organs.

300
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,174
Mr. Pruitt, your wife's brain
is not functioning

301
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:15,375
at its most basic level.

302
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,343
There is no medical
distinction

303
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:19,746
between brain death
and cardiac death.

304
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,749
You said that the machines
are keeping her alive.

305
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:24,217
Not exactly.

306
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,119
They're merely keeping
her organs viable.

307
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:34,094
Can't you just let
her die naturally?

308
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:36,096
To get healthy organs,
we procure

309
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,397
while the heart's still beating

310
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,199
and there's oxygen
in the bloodstream.

311
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:41,367
I‐I don't know.
I don't know.

312
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:43,904
I mean, we never
talked about this.

313
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:46,072
Look, I know she filled out
the card and everything‐‐

314
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:48,509
I understand.

315
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,977
I'm not so sure
that I can do this.

316
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,917
Why don't you take
some time with her?

317
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,719
I'll come back
and we'll talk some more.

318
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:03,757
Dr. Corday,
pre‐op's ready.

319
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,091
We're gonna wait a bit.

320
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:10,797
Abby, I need morphine now
for a perilunate dislocation.

321
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:12,065
How much?

322
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:15,001
Uh, get 20
just to be safe.

323
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:16,202
What's the patient's name?

324
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,337
Bovard.

325
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:21,341
I saw Nicole.
They let her go?

326
00:12:23,544 --> 00:12:25,011
I'm sure
she'll find another job.

327
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:26,913
It's not important.

328
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:27,981
She might wanna
take it easy now

329
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:29,115
with the baby coming.

330
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:32,385
She's keeping it?

331
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,255
You thought she wouldn't?

332
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:38,458
Uh, I don't know,
it's‐it's tough

333
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:39,826
being a single mother.

334
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,061
Maybe she won't be.

335
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,030
Um, I'll need some Versed too.

336
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:45,065
You can't be serious.

337
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,466
She's a good person.

338
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,001
You met her, like,
five minutes ago.

339
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:49,102
It's the right thing to do.

340
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:52,105
Did she ever take
a pregnancy test?

341
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:54,908
‐ Of course.
‐ Did you see it?

342
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:58,411
‐ I mean, in front of you?
‐ I trust her.

343
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,013
What, exactly, has she done
to deserve that?

344
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:01,047
How can you be so‐‐

345
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:02,315
Even if it is yours

346
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:03,984
there's other ways to help.

347
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,856
How much Versed?

348
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:10,924
‐ I'll do it.
‐ No, I'll do it‐‐

349
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,325
I said I'll do it.

350
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,469
There was some bleeding
deep inside Rudy's brain.

351
00:13:23,504 --> 00:13:25,071
How bad is it?

352
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:27,073
The problem's usually
a weak arterial wall.

353
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:29,610
If we can prevent any further
hemorrhage, he should be okay.

354
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:31,211
He's always begging to get in
the ring with his brother.

355
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:33,046
I shouldn't have let him do it.

356
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:35,549
Um, this isn't from boxing.
It's a pre‐existing condition.

357
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:37,083
What do you have to do?

358
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:39,385
The neural radiologist
can use a catheter

359
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:41,054
to mend the artery
from within.

360
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:43,356
‐ And then he'll be okay?
‐ He should be.

361
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,559
Look, you didn't
cause this, okay?

362
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:46,893
It could have happened
at any time.

363
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:50,964
It happened when I hit him.

364
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:53,166
Susan, you have curtain two?
Woman with hives?

365
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,135
No, I've got
the thyrotoxicosis.

366
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,402
‐ It's me. It's mine.
‐ Is she ready for dispo?

367
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:58,371
No, I'm still working her up.

368
00:13:58,404 --> 00:13:59,472
Hey, have either one of you guys

369
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,307
ever heard
of an allergy to semen?

370
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,944
Maybe an aversion,
but not an allergy.

371
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:06,446
There's hundreds of proteins
that are potential antigens.

372
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:08,114
Is that your best diagnosis?

373
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:09,249
It's a possibility.

374
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:10,984
You must be desperate.

375
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,285
This is Sean Gatley.

376
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:13,486
My foot's stuck.

377
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,955
You doing okay, buddy?

378
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:16,489
Dad wouldn't let us
break the thing.

379
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:17,558
The toilet?

380
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:19,593
It's a personal
hygiene system.

381
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:22,629
Ugh, you're out
of your mind.

382
00:14:22,663 --> 00:14:26,132
Hey, Dr. Weaver, right?
Sandy Lopez.

383
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,568
‐ Right.
‐ Good job last week.

384
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:29,369
I hear the lady
and the baby are doing okay.

385
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:30,937
‐ Yeah. Hey, Abby, I got this.
‐ Okay.

386
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:35,408
‐ Do you need something?
‐ I was looking for Luka.

387
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:36,943
He's with a patient.

388
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:38,344
Oh.

389
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,446
Do you wanna
a cup of coffee?

390
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,517
So, based on your extensive
observation of Dr. Benton

391
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,520
and Reese, how would you
summarize their relationship?

392
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:50,223
Peter's completely
devoted to Reese.

393
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:53,259
He's always focused
on what's best for him.

394
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:56,062
'I can't imagine anyone
being a better father.'

395
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:57,097
Thank you.

396
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,467
Are you and Dr. Benton married?

397
00:15:01,502 --> 00:15:02,669
No.

398
00:15:02,703 --> 00:15:04,137
Living together?

399
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,939
We've discussed it.

400
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:07,373
How long have you been a couple?

401
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:08,441
Almost three years.

402
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,277
So, you didn't break up in June?

403
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:13,246
It wasn't exactly
a break‐up‐‐

404
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,348
And get back together again,
about two weeks ago?

405
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:16,583
What are you, tracking
my love life?

406
00:15:16,617 --> 00:15:18,251
Objection. Argumentative.

407
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:19,285
Sustained.

408
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:21,187
Let me ask

409
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:23,557
do you consider yourself
a stable factor in Reese's life?

410
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,158
I do.

411
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:26,492
How can we be sure
you won't break up again

412
00:15:26,527 --> 00:15:28,995
next week, or next month,
or next year?

413
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:31,031
Objection. Calls for prophecy.

414
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:32,398
'Goes to the stability
of the home.'

415
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,034
Point taken, but you can answer.

416
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:36,503
It's my intention to be around

417
00:15:36,537 --> 00:15:39,072
Peter and Reese for a long time.

418
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,374
'You occasionally babysit
for Reese, don't you?'

419
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:43,544
Quite often.
We get along well.

420
00:15:43,577 --> 00:15:45,646
There was an incident
with a piano.

421
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:48,281
'Could you explain?'

422
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,551
‐ Reese hurt himself.
‐ Under your care.

423
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:53,186
I, it wasn't my‐‐

424
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:54,220
So, that's the supervision

425
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:56,456
Dr. Benton entrusts his son to.

426
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,324
‐ Objection.
‐ I looked away for two seconds.

427
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:00,460
When he's the one who should
have been looking after him.

428
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:02,295
Are you gonna ask a question?

429
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:06,399
Counselors, let's all breathe.
15 minute recess.

430
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:13,206
Thanks.
Is that decaf?

431
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:15,308
No.

432
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:18,011
Oh, I shouldn't have caffeine.

433
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:19,179
Oh, right, I forgot.

434
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:21,882
Luka told you?

435
00:16:25,686 --> 00:16:28,054
Have you had
a pre‐natal exam yet?

436
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:30,056
‐ Not yet.
‐ I used to work in OB.

437
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:32,158
I could do an ultrasound.

438
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:34,595
That's nice of you,
but I‐I'll take care of it.

439
00:16:34,628 --> 00:16:35,996
How do you know you're pregnant?

440
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:40,033
Thanks for the coffee.

441
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:42,669
This is not the way
to get Luka.

442
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:45,806
What are you talking about?

443
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,407
The truth.

444
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:50,511
What happened to your father?

445
00:16:50,544 --> 00:16:52,613
I told you, he killed himself
when I was little.

446
00:16:52,646 --> 00:16:55,248
And then, miraculously
came back to life again

447
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:56,817
so he could kick you out
when you were 16?

448
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,719
Is this funny to you?

449
00:16:58,752 --> 00:17:01,655
No. I'm just trying
to figure it out.

450
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:03,356
You haven't told anyone
the same story twice.

451
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,560
My mother remarried
and my stepfather

452
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:07,794
didn't want me around.

453
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,798
Okay, I guess you have an answer
for everything.

454
00:17:11,832 --> 00:17:13,499
I guess everything's
your business.

455
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:14,835
I just don't wanna
see him hurt.

456
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:16,336
Maybe you don't wanna
see him happy.

457
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:23,677
'I know what won't
make him happy.'

458
00:17:24,745 --> 00:17:25,846
A made‐up life.

459
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,614
I, you know, if‐if this

460
00:17:27,648 --> 00:17:30,684
if this is all for real,
that's great, go for it.

461
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:32,719
But if it's not,
he's gonna figure it out.

462
00:17:32,753 --> 00:17:34,054
He's not stupid.

463
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,428
You know, I never got a chance
to thank you for the‐‐

464
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:43,496
Saving your life?

465
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:44,631
Uh, yeah, that.

466
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:47,701
Listen, no sweat.

467
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,269
It was a crazy night.

468
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:50,837
That's a pretty crazy job.

469
00:17:50,871 --> 00:17:54,140
I haven't met too many
female firefighters.

470
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:55,876
Only one in Company B.

471
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:58,278
Must be
pretty challenging.

472
00:17:58,311 --> 00:17:59,345
No, not really.

473
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:00,847
I'm just one of the guys.

474
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,751
Anyway, I'll see you around.

475
00:18:04,785 --> 00:18:06,186
Did you get a wound check?

476
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:08,288
‐ Hmm?
‐ Your hand.

477
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:12,325
Oh, uh, I don't like doctors.

478
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:14,595
You should let me take
a look at it before you go.

479
00:18:14,628 --> 00:18:16,296
Maybe some other time.

480
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:21,768
‐ What happened?
‐ Rudy dropped his sats.

481
00:18:21,802 --> 00:18:23,537
BP's 230/120.

482
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,305
Pulse ox 78 on 15 liters.

483
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:27,841
‐ He stopped breathing.
‐ One of pavulon, 100 of sux.

484
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:31,244
‐ What's going on?
‐ Let's check the fundi.

485
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,478
There's increased pressure
in your son's brain.

486
00:18:32,513 --> 00:18:33,680
What are you gonna do?

487
00:18:33,714 --> 00:18:35,649
Well, we're gonna help
him breathe first.

488
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:37,250
Multifocal PVCs.

489
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,885
‐ Dr. Greene?
‐ Push another 100 of lidocaine.

490
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:40,420
Heart rate 58.

491
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,355
‐ It's Rachel.
‐ I can't talk right now.

492
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:44,390
Start nipride at 70 mics.

493
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:45,859
She says you told her
to check in.

494
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:48,261
Elizabeth will be home at 6:00.

495
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:49,295
I'm in.

496
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:51,732
Lily, another 60 of nimodipine.

497
00:18:51,765 --> 00:18:53,667
I'll get it.

498
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,235
Looks like V‐tach.

499
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:57,437
‐ Oh, God.
‐ No pulse.

500
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,172
Charge to 200,
and start compressions.

501
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:03,409
Have you ever tried
a non‐heart beating protocol?

502
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:04,778
I observed one
at Case Western.

503
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:07,548
They take the patient
to the OR, turn off the vent

504
00:19:07,581 --> 00:19:09,182
and wait for the heart
to stop beating.

505
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:11,351
Meanwhile, lack of oxygen
can ruin the organs.

506
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:14,254
You remove them after only two
minutes of cardiac arrest.

507
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:16,289
They should still be viable,
and she'll get a natural death.

508
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,224
She's dead either way.

509
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:20,426
This approach only compromises
the success of the transplant.

510
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,597
It's the only approach
the husband will consent to.

511
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,766
You know that for a fact?

512
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,801
You presented this
to Mr. Pruitt?

513
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,269
'Luka?'

514
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:32,939
I‐I suggested it as an option.

515
00:19:32,973 --> 00:19:33,974
Without consulting me.

516
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,709
She's my patient too.

517
00:19:35,742 --> 00:19:37,310
You're not the one
who needs approval

518
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,779
for an unconventional procedure,
nor are you the one

519
00:19:38,812 --> 00:19:39,780
going to have to do it.

520
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:44,951
‐ Can you take a break?
‐ Yeah.

521
00:19:46,887 --> 00:19:48,955
Dr. Weaver, is there anyone
in exam four?

522
00:19:48,989 --> 00:19:50,824
The middle bed in there's free.

523
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,659
Uh, I don't wanna
tie up a monitor.

524
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:54,227
Hey, do I have to keep
this in my arm?

525
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,729
Yeah, if I'm right,
you might even need

526
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:57,263
emergency meds.

527
00:19:57,297 --> 00:19:58,632
What if someone comes in?

528
00:19:58,665 --> 00:20:01,301
These doors lock
from the inside.

529
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:02,669
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ Is that what I think it is?

530
00:20:04,004 --> 00:20:05,672
Ah. Just give me one second.

531
00:20:05,706 --> 00:20:06,907
Malik.

532
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,675
I thought this guy
was going to the morgue.

533
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:09,710
Yeah, I was just about to.

534
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:12,979
‐ We need epi in here.
‐ How many amps?

535
00:20:13,013 --> 00:20:14,715
As much as you can carry.

536
00:20:14,748 --> 00:20:16,683
Maybe this isn't
such a good idea.

537
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:17,851
No, it will be fine.

538
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:21,287
Charged to 360.

539
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:22,523
Clear.

540
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:26,560
‐ 'Asystole.'
‐ How long has he been down?

541
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:28,595
‐ Forty five minutes.
‐ Alright. Resume compressions.

542
00:20:28,629 --> 00:20:30,597
‐ How much epi?
‐ Push another four milligrams.

543
00:20:30,631 --> 00:20:33,600
‐ How much longer are we going?
‐ Uh, I'm gonna bring 'em in.

544
00:20:33,634 --> 00:20:35,301
‐ You're calling it?
‐ Not yet.

545
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:43,777
Rudy hasn't had a heartbeat
in almost an hour.

546
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,311
How could this happen?

547
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:46,913
He had a massive hemorrhage.

548
00:20:46,947 --> 00:20:47,948
No.

549
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:51,051
It damaged the part of his brain

550
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:53,386
that controls his heart
and his breathing.

551
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:54,454
You said
they could fix it.

552
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:56,289
There wasn't enough time.

553
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:58,692
Keep trying, please.

554
00:20:58,725 --> 00:21:00,393
We've shocked him repeatedly.

555
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,729
We've used every drug.
Nothing is working.

556
00:21:05,065 --> 00:21:06,700
Do you wanna say goodbye
before we stop?

557
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:24,818
You fought hard, Rudy.

558
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:27,487
You never gave up.

559
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:32,458
I'm proud of you.

560
00:21:34,027 --> 00:21:35,529
'We'll never forget you.'

561
00:21:35,562 --> 00:21:36,597
Shut up.

562
00:21:38,732 --> 00:21:39,700
We love you, mijo.

563
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:43,804
You'll always be
in our hearts.

564
00:21:43,837 --> 00:21:45,572
Shut up! Shut up!

565
00:21:47,073 --> 00:21:48,108
Can you hear me?

566
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:49,409
Can you hear me?

567
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:50,844
'Shut, shut up!'

568
00:21:52,513 --> 00:21:54,114
Shut up!

569
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:10,096
Just let us know
when you want us to stop.

570
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:21,842
I hope it snows.

571
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:23,944
I'd like to see
the city covered in white.

572
00:22:23,977 --> 00:22:26,012
Yeah, it's pretty.

573
00:22:26,046 --> 00:22:28,715
Till your car won't start.

574
00:22:28,749 --> 00:22:30,116
Maybe I can get a job
shoveling sidewalks.

575
00:22:32,085 --> 00:22:33,720
Might be good if you don't work
for a while.

576
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,690
'Take care of yourself.'

577
00:22:36,723 --> 00:22:37,824
The baby.

578
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:41,762
I need to work.

579
00:22:41,795 --> 00:22:43,029
You don't need to worry
about the rent.

580
00:22:44,731 --> 00:22:46,166
I talked to my friend.

581
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:48,401
I think I found a job.

582
00:22:48,434 --> 00:22:49,836
Wow, that was quick.

583
00:22:51,004 --> 00:22:52,438
He's opening a cafe in Montreal.

584
00:22:53,807 --> 00:22:55,475
'He wants me to help run it.'

585
00:22:58,845 --> 00:23:01,515
I can't move to Montreal.

586
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:03,717
You've been very generous.

587
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,752
I'm thankful for everything.

588
00:23:05,786 --> 00:23:07,988
S‐so..

589
00:23:08,021 --> 00:23:09,856
...what are you saying?
That's it?

590
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,057
'You could leave like that?'

591
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:14,728
Listen, m‐my shift's
over at 7:00.

592
00:23:14,761 --> 00:23:17,097
Let's‐let's talk
about this tonight.

593
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,566
I'll call you in a few days.

594
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,535
Are you angry with me?

595
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:22,569
No, of course not.

596
00:23:22,603 --> 00:23:24,004
Do you think I'm angry with you?

597
00:23:25,205 --> 00:23:26,573
I hope not.

598
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:31,778
Then why? I‐I, I thought
we both felt the same.

599
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:33,980
You're a good person

600
00:23:34,014 --> 00:23:36,449
but you talked yourself
into loving me.

601
00:23:36,482 --> 00:23:37,584
This isn't real.

602
00:23:40,186 --> 00:23:41,855
'I'll leave the key inside.'

603
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:46,492
I made an OB appointment
for Friday.

604
00:23:48,161 --> 00:23:50,096
It's not necessary.

605
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:52,198
It is.

606
00:23:52,232 --> 00:23:53,800
No, it's not.

607
00:23:53,834 --> 00:23:54,901
I'm not pregnant.

608
00:23:57,904 --> 00:24:00,707
I felt safe for the first time
in a long time.

609
00:24:00,741 --> 00:24:02,843
I didn't wanna lose you.

610
00:24:02,876 --> 00:24:04,477
So I made it up, Luka.

611
00:24:07,581 --> 00:24:09,482
I'm sorry.
I made it all up.

612
00:24:16,256 --> 00:24:17,858
I think we need two layers.

613
00:24:17,891 --> 00:24:19,593
You know how to bury the knot?

614
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:20,861
Take your first bite
in the center deep

615
00:24:20,894 --> 00:24:22,128
and then come up sub‐Q.

616
00:24:22,162 --> 00:24:24,197
‐ You hear something?
‐ You're nuts.

617
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,800
‐ I hear banging.
‐ What's that noise?

618
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:28,201
Oh, I think they were working
on the pipes or..

619
00:24:29,636 --> 00:24:31,638
Oh, that don't sound
like pipes.

620
00:24:31,672 --> 00:24:34,207
‐ You got this?
‐ Yeah, yeah, I think so.

621
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,276
‐ Who is in there?
‐ My allergy patient.

622
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:38,111
‐ The lady with hives?
‐ And her husband.

623
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,245
Don't tell me
you are tying up

624
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,547
a room
so they can have sex.

625
00:24:40,581 --> 00:24:43,249
I'm...conducting
a clinical trial.

626
00:24:43,283 --> 00:24:44,885
Send them to an allergist.

627
00:24:44,918 --> 00:24:46,019
No, that'll take weeks.

628
00:24:46,052 --> 00:24:48,522
They're young.
They're aroused.

629
00:24:48,555 --> 00:24:49,890
They want their answer now.

630
00:24:49,923 --> 00:24:51,525
Does Weaver know
you're running a brothel?

631
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:53,794
It's not a brothel
if they're married.

632
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:55,962
Dr. Lewis, lab's back
on Escalona.

633
00:24:55,996 --> 00:24:56,997
I didn't order any labs.

634
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,164
Rudy? Kid who arrested.

635
00:24:58,198 --> 00:25:00,767
‐ Oh, I had the brother.
‐ That's mine.

636
00:25:00,801 --> 00:25:02,002
It wasn't your fault.

637
00:25:02,035 --> 00:25:04,771
Sometimes things happen
you can't explain.

638
00:25:04,805 --> 00:25:05,906
Rudy's labs came back.

639
00:25:05,939 --> 00:25:07,207
Did he ever take any stimulants?

640
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,709
I'd never let him do that.

641
00:25:08,742 --> 00:25:10,744
There was ephedra
in his bloodstream.

642
00:25:10,777 --> 00:25:12,746
‐ Ephedra?
‐ It's a natural supplement.

643
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:14,548
It's in, uh, power formulas.

644
00:25:14,581 --> 00:25:16,316
He drinks Beta‐Morph sometimes.

645
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:18,719
‐ From where?
‐ From the store.

646
00:25:18,752 --> 00:25:20,320
He wanted to drink a six‐pack
before we sparred.

647
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:22,055
He said he wanted
to dust me for once.

648
00:25:22,088 --> 00:25:24,290
The ephedra probably raised
his blood pressure

649
00:25:24,324 --> 00:25:26,993
causing one of the vessels
in his brain to rupture.

650
00:25:27,027 --> 00:25:28,028
Why would he do it?

651
00:25:28,061 --> 00:25:29,295
To enhance his performance.

652
00:25:29,329 --> 00:25:30,964
He wanted to make
you proud, dad.

653
00:25:30,997 --> 00:25:32,198
You knew about this?

654
00:25:32,232 --> 00:25:33,800
He was never tough enough
for you.

655
00:25:33,834 --> 00:25:35,702
Why didn't you stop him?

656
00:25:35,736 --> 00:25:37,971
You kept pushing him
and you never let up.

657
00:25:38,004 --> 00:25:39,706
‐ Calm down, guys.
‐ No, he was just a kid.

658
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,807
No, he wanted to be a champ.

659
00:25:40,841 --> 00:25:43,143
No, that's what you wanted.

660
00:25:43,176 --> 00:25:44,678
It's over.
I'm through.

661
00:25:44,711 --> 00:25:46,580
This is not the way
to honor your brother.

662
00:25:46,613 --> 00:25:48,582
It's my choice.
It's not your choice.

663
00:25:48,615 --> 00:25:49,916
You were born with a gift.

664
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,785
‐ Look, come on, Jorge‐‐
‐ No, here's your gift.

665
00:25:54,655 --> 00:25:56,056
Here's your gift.

666
00:26:00,126 --> 00:26:03,797
Man, he's spinning everything
his way.

667
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,365
We'll get it all back
on your testimony.

668
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:06,600
Hey.

669
00:26:06,633 --> 00:26:07,701
Hey, everything alright?

670
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:09,670
Yeah, I just couldn't sit
at home

671
00:26:09,703 --> 00:26:11,738
not knowing what was going on.

672
00:26:11,772 --> 00:26:13,039
We're just getting started.

673
00:26:13,073 --> 00:26:14,274
You testify yet?

674
00:26:14,307 --> 00:26:15,809
No, Roger went first.

675
00:26:15,842 --> 00:26:17,210
What did he say?

676
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:18,812
That I was the world's
greatest father.

677
00:26:20,681 --> 00:26:22,248
Peter.

678
00:26:22,282 --> 00:26:24,250
I asked him to help out
with Reese a couple of times.

679
00:26:24,284 --> 00:26:27,220
He made it seem like
it happens all the time.

680
00:26:29,189 --> 00:26:30,256
He lied.

681
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:31,925
It's his version of the truth.

682
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:33,159
Isn't that perjury?

683
00:26:33,193 --> 00:26:35,128
Isn't there something
you can do?

684
00:26:35,161 --> 00:26:36,897
‐ 'Jackie.'
‐ Why were you lying?

685
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,665
‐ Jackie?
‐ Leave us alone.

686
00:26:38,699 --> 00:26:40,100
‐ 'Jackie, don't.'
‐ Get away from me.

687
00:26:40,133 --> 00:26:42,636
Wait a minute, stop it,
and tell the truth.

688
00:26:42,669 --> 00:26:44,938
‐ Ma'am, step away.
‐ 'Jackie, you're not helping.'

689
00:26:44,971 --> 00:26:46,840
Get your own family.

690
00:26:46,873 --> 00:26:49,142
He got us here.
His choice.

691
00:26:49,175 --> 00:26:51,044
‐ Reese is our boy.
‐ Jackie‐‐

692
00:26:51,077 --> 00:26:52,378
‐ He's our boy!
‐ Jackie.

693
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:06,860
What are you doing?

694
00:27:06,893 --> 00:27:08,094
Getting caught up
on my charts.

695
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:09,996
‐ You were listening.
‐ No.

696
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,932
You were, you were listening
to them have sex.

697
00:27:11,965 --> 00:27:12,966
I am not.

698
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:14,835
You usually chart at Admit

699
00:27:14,868 --> 00:27:16,269
or in the lounge.

700
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:18,404
I can chart wherever I want,
and I don't need to listen

701
00:27:18,438 --> 00:27:20,907
to your porno patients
for kicks.

702
00:27:23,877 --> 00:27:25,445
‐ They stopped.
‐ See?

703
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:27,113
‐ You were listening.
‐ Do you think she's okay?

704
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:28,414
Do you think we should check?

705
00:27:32,018 --> 00:27:33,887
What's going on in there?

706
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,021
Ask Carter.

707
00:27:42,896 --> 00:27:45,398
You broke your fifth metacarpal.

708
00:27:45,431 --> 00:27:47,033
Damn.

709
00:27:47,067 --> 00:27:49,035
Hey, that's what they call
a boxer's fracture.

710
00:27:49,069 --> 00:27:51,371
You're gonna be in a cast
for about six weeks.

711
00:27:51,404 --> 00:27:53,239
‐ Good.
‐ Dr. Greene?

712
00:27:53,273 --> 00:27:55,208
'Teenager with a ten‐foot fall
coming in.'

713
00:27:55,241 --> 00:27:56,877
Get Carter.
Clear trauma one.

714
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,845
Hey, you want me on that?

715
00:27:58,879 --> 00:28:00,446
Numb him up first.
Hematoma block.

716
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,151
Does my dad know?

717
00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:06,419
Uh, not yet.

718
00:28:09,222 --> 00:28:10,791
It would be better coming
from you.

719
00:28:14,294 --> 00:28:15,729
Listen, Jorge, uh..

720
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:19,499
...everybody has a hard time
talking to their father.

721
00:28:19,533 --> 00:28:21,034
Well, it's different with him.

722
00:28:21,067 --> 00:28:22,168
I mean, he's old school.

723
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:24,037
He grew up in Cuba.

724
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:26,139
And when did he come over?

725
00:28:26,172 --> 00:28:27,708
Before I was born.

726
00:28:28,975 --> 00:28:30,043
He was a great fighter.

727
00:28:31,812 --> 00:28:33,379
When he tried to leave,
they broke his hands.

728
00:28:35,015 --> 00:28:37,117
Well, that's, uh, why
he pushes you so hard.

729
00:28:38,885 --> 00:28:40,521
Yeah.

730
00:28:40,554 --> 00:28:41,922
I guess he just wants us to have

731
00:28:41,955 --> 00:28:43,189
what they took away from him.

732
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:46,827
You ever talk to him about this?

733
00:28:49,295 --> 00:28:50,731
'Well, maybe you should.'

734
00:28:55,035 --> 00:28:56,269
I'm sorry, honey.

735
00:28:56,302 --> 00:28:57,771
Maybe you just need
a little break.

736
00:28:57,804 --> 00:28:59,239
Carter.

737
00:28:59,272 --> 00:29:00,440
Well, he never used to have
a problem finishing.

738
00:29:00,473 --> 00:29:02,075
That dead guy freaked me.

739
00:29:02,108 --> 00:29:03,977
Well, you need to use condoms
until you can try again

740
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:05,278
under medical supervision.

741
00:29:05,311 --> 00:29:06,980
I never used to be allergic
to sperm.

742
00:29:07,013 --> 00:29:08,481
It's the semen, actually.

743
00:29:08,515 --> 00:29:10,283
Oh, what would cause that?

744
00:29:10,316 --> 00:29:12,786
Sometimes multiple
sex partners‐‐

745
00:29:12,819 --> 00:29:13,954
Have you had more than ten?

746
00:29:15,989 --> 00:29:18,091
‐ Ten?
‐ Let's go, honey.

747
00:29:18,124 --> 00:29:20,794
I thought it was just me
and Kenny Markowitz.

748
00:29:20,827 --> 00:29:22,128
What else haven't you told me?

749
00:29:22,162 --> 00:29:23,864
That's a very good job there.

750
00:29:23,897 --> 00:29:25,832
‐ It's very diplomatic.
‐ It was your diagnosis.

751
00:29:25,866 --> 00:29:27,100
No, I bring people
together, Susan.

752
00:29:27,133 --> 00:29:29,135
Oh, yes, you and Cupid.

753
00:29:29,169 --> 00:29:31,104
Sixteen‐year‐old male
fell from a lamppost.

754
00:29:31,137 --> 00:29:32,506
‐ 'Carter.'
‐ Uh‐huh.

755
00:29:32,539 --> 00:29:33,840
Good vitals.
No LOC.

756
00:29:33,874 --> 00:29:35,441
An obvious ankle fracture.

757
00:29:35,475 --> 00:29:36,877
No meds, no allergies.

758
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,411
Okay, everybody,
grab hold, on my count.

759
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:40,046
One, two and three.

760
00:29:41,381 --> 00:29:42,883
Pulse ox 99 on two liters.

761
00:29:42,916 --> 00:29:44,417
‐ You got any pain here?
‐ No, I'm fine.

762
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,553
‐ Turn your head towards me.
‐ 'You need any help? '

763
00:29:46,587 --> 00:29:48,288
Yeah, can you Doppler the foot?

764
00:29:48,321 --> 00:29:49,956
‐ You got it.
‐ Okay if I cuff him, doc?

765
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,291
'Yeah, do it on the right side.'

766
00:29:51,324 --> 00:29:53,259
‐ Turn away from me.
‐ BP's 124 over 78.

767
00:29:53,293 --> 00:29:54,828
‐ 'Does it hurt?'
‐ 'No.'

768
00:29:54,861 --> 00:29:56,196
Neck's clear. Let's get him
off the board.

769
00:29:56,229 --> 00:29:57,831
Bounding dorsalis pedis.

770
00:29:57,864 --> 00:29:59,833
‐ Go.
‐ What's he in custody for?

771
00:29:59,866 --> 00:30:01,134
Kids were stealing street signs.

772
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:02,603
‐ Anybody else hurt?
‐ No, girl's fine.

773
00:30:02,636 --> 00:30:04,070
She's in the car
with my partner.

774
00:30:04,104 --> 00:30:05,506
Okay, we're gonna
sit you up now.

775
00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:07,040
What's your name?

776
00:30:07,073 --> 00:30:08,141
Andrew.

777
00:30:09,643 --> 00:30:10,977
Don't I know you?

778
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:15,015
That your daughter?

779
00:30:15,048 --> 00:30:16,316
'She's not under arrest?'

780
00:30:16,349 --> 00:30:17,518
'No, situations like this'

781
00:30:17,551 --> 00:30:19,152
we just like to scare them
a little bit.

782
00:30:19,185 --> 00:30:21,021
Take them down to the station,
call their parents.

783
00:30:21,054 --> 00:30:22,623
‐ 'They'll release her to me?'
‐ 'I'll call the sergeant.'

784
00:30:22,656 --> 00:30:24,525
‐ Don't think it'd be a problem.
‐ I'd appreciate that.

785
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:26,059
Got a phone I can use?

786
00:30:26,092 --> 00:30:27,928
I adjusted her meds,
have the nurse call

787
00:30:27,961 --> 00:30:29,429
if she has any questions.

788
00:30:29,462 --> 00:30:30,931
‐ 'Sandy.'
‐ Hey.

789
00:30:30,964 --> 00:30:32,198
Still got time
for a wound check?

790
00:30:32,232 --> 00:30:34,034
Uh, I thought you had
to leave AMA.

791
00:30:34,067 --> 00:30:35,201
Oh, it wasn't bothering me

792
00:30:35,235 --> 00:30:37,037
until I jammed it
rolling some hose.

793
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,872
‐ Still bleeding?
‐ I don't think so.

794
00:30:38,905 --> 00:30:40,406
‐ Come on, let's take a look.
‐ Okay.

795
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,643
'What happens when
you're on call?'

796
00:30:42,676 --> 00:30:44,545
We work 12‐hour shifts.

797
00:30:44,578 --> 00:30:45,979
7:00 a. m. to 7:00 p. m?

798
00:30:46,012 --> 00:30:47,313
Half the time.

799
00:30:47,347 --> 00:30:48,982
And the other half,
you work overnight?

800
00:30:49,015 --> 00:30:51,317
There's always a surgeon
in‐house.

801
00:30:51,351 --> 00:30:54,320
‐ So, you cover weekends too?
‐ Sometimes.

802
00:30:54,354 --> 00:30:55,522
Well, looking at your schedule,
it appears

803
00:30:55,556 --> 00:30:56,557
that over half your shifts

804
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:58,091
are weekends or overnights.

805
00:30:58,124 --> 00:30:59,593
Well, I'd have to check.

806
00:30:59,626 --> 00:31:01,461
Take me through what happens
when a gunshot victim

807
00:31:01,494 --> 00:31:03,630
enters the ER.

808
00:31:03,664 --> 00:31:05,231
Well, I evaluate the patient

809
00:31:05,265 --> 00:31:07,901
and I take them
to the OR, if necessary.

810
00:31:07,934 --> 00:31:09,135
Gunshot to the chest.

811
00:31:09,169 --> 00:31:11,037
How long of an operation
is that?

812
00:31:11,071 --> 00:31:12,673
‐ Well, that depends.
‐ 'On what?'

813
00:31:12,706 --> 00:31:15,275
The path of the bullet,
extent of vascular damage

814
00:31:15,308 --> 00:31:18,612
if bypass is necessary
for cardiac repair.

815
00:31:18,645 --> 00:31:21,014
So, it could take
over an hour?

816
00:31:21,047 --> 00:31:22,683
I'd say three hours
was a reasonable estimate.

817
00:31:22,716 --> 00:31:24,651
Sometimes longer?
Five hours?

818
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,353
Sometimes.

819
00:31:27,387 --> 00:31:29,122
'So, if a patient comes in
at 6:30 p. m.'

820
00:31:29,155 --> 00:31:31,992
who takes over for you at 7:00
when you go home to Reese?

821
00:31:32,025 --> 00:31:34,060
Well, I try to get someone
to cover for me.

822
00:31:34,094 --> 00:31:36,162
And if you can't?

823
00:31:36,196 --> 00:31:37,964
Then I stay with the patient.

824
00:31:37,998 --> 00:31:39,966
If an operation takes five hours

825
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,067
you'll be there till midnight?

826
00:31:42,435 --> 00:31:43,904
That's a rare situation.

827
00:31:44,705 --> 00:31:46,540
But it happens?

828
00:31:46,573 --> 00:31:48,942
It's possible.

829
00:31:48,975 --> 00:31:50,410
So, when you're tied up
in surgery all night

830
00:31:50,443 --> 00:31:52,245
'who's looking after Reese?'

831
00:31:52,278 --> 00:31:55,315
Well, I have the support
of family and friends.

832
00:31:55,348 --> 00:31:57,117
Like Dr. Finch, for example?

833
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:58,251
Yes.

834
00:31:58,284 --> 00:32:00,286
Cleo is very good with Reese.

835
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,022
'Yes, we've already
covered that.'

836
00:32:02,055 --> 00:32:03,690
Who else helps you out?

837
00:32:03,724 --> 00:32:06,059
My sister, Jackie picks him up
from school if I have to work.

838
00:32:06,092 --> 00:32:07,994
‐ And makes him dinner?
‐ Sometimes.

839
00:32:08,028 --> 00:32:10,163
And puts him to bed while
you're working the night shift?

840
00:32:10,196 --> 00:32:11,297
That's right.

841
00:32:11,331 --> 00:32:12,398
Is she always available?

842
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,235
Jackie's become like a mother

843
00:32:15,268 --> 00:32:16,603
to Reese these last few months.

844
00:32:16,637 --> 00:32:18,171
But initially, after Carla died

845
00:32:18,204 --> 00:32:19,606
Jackie wasn't so receptive
to the idea

846
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,508
of caring for Reese, was she?

847
00:32:21,542 --> 00:32:22,743
It was a tough time.

848
00:32:22,776 --> 00:32:24,645
She has her own children,
doesn't she?

849
00:32:24,678 --> 00:32:26,412
Joanie, her daughter.

850
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:27,548
Wasn't there a boy?

851
00:32:29,516 --> 00:32:31,351
Yeah, uh, Jesse, my nephew.

852
00:32:31,384 --> 00:32:33,520
He died last year.

853
00:32:33,554 --> 00:32:35,421
The death was gang‐related,
right?

854
00:32:35,455 --> 00:32:37,490
‐ Objection.
‐ He can answer the question.

855
00:32:40,561 --> 00:32:42,228
Yes.

856
00:32:42,262 --> 00:32:44,565
How is your sister handling
that loss?

857
00:32:44,598 --> 00:32:47,233
You know, I'm sorry.
I don't, uh..

858
00:32:47,267 --> 00:32:50,003
I don't see how this pertains
to my fitness as a father.

859
00:32:50,036 --> 00:32:51,437
Your Honor,
this is far afield.

860
00:32:51,471 --> 00:32:53,273
Goes to the stability
of the person he's identified

861
00:32:53,306 --> 00:32:54,508
as primary caregiver.

862
00:32:54,541 --> 00:32:56,643
I'll give some latitude.

863
00:32:56,677 --> 00:32:59,145
Is Jackie under the care
of a psychiatrist?

864
00:32:59,179 --> 00:33:00,280
I don't know.

865
00:33:00,313 --> 00:33:01,414
For situational depression

866
00:33:01,447 --> 00:33:02,583
and pathologic grieving?

867
00:33:02,616 --> 00:33:04,217
She lost her son.

868
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:06,319
Is she currently
being managed by medication‐‐

869
00:33:06,352 --> 00:33:07,453
This has nothing
to do with Reese

870
00:33:07,487 --> 00:33:08,488
or my ability
to care for him.

871
00:33:08,522 --> 00:33:10,090
...whose side effects include

872
00:33:10,123 --> 00:33:12,125
insomnia, sedation
and anxiety?

873
00:33:12,158 --> 00:33:13,560
Gentlemen!

874
00:33:13,594 --> 00:33:15,361
Why don't you ask me
what kind of father I am?

875
00:33:15,395 --> 00:33:17,063
Why don't you ask me
about how I was there

876
00:33:17,097 --> 00:33:18,632
when he was born prematurely

877
00:33:18,665 --> 00:33:20,801
how I stayed in the hospital
in the NICU

878
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:22,569
watching over him,
making tough decisions

879
00:33:22,603 --> 00:33:24,037
and praying over him
day and night?

880
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,238
Why don't you ask me that?

881
00:33:25,271 --> 00:33:26,540
Your Honor,
a moment with my client.

882
00:33:26,573 --> 00:33:28,174
Dr. Benton‐‐

883
00:33:28,208 --> 00:33:29,375
Your Honor, there's no question
before the court.

884
00:33:29,409 --> 00:33:31,444
No, why don't you ask me
about Reese

885
00:33:31,477 --> 00:33:33,747
so I can tell you that
there's nothing more important

886
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,348
to me in this world
than my son?

887
00:33:35,381 --> 00:33:36,783
Why don't you ask me that?

888
00:33:51,231 --> 00:33:52,198
You can't let that happen again.

889
00:33:52,232 --> 00:33:53,299
They were provoking him.

890
00:33:53,333 --> 00:33:54,434
You better get used
to it, Peter.

891
00:33:54,467 --> 00:33:55,468
I said what I had to say.

892
00:33:55,501 --> 00:33:56,537
Well, I hope you feel better

893
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:57,771
'cause it sure didn't help.

894
00:33:57,804 --> 00:33:59,372
What did the judge say
in chambers?

895
00:33:59,405 --> 00:34:02,108
That he was impressed
with Roger's availability.

896
00:34:02,142 --> 00:34:03,844
‐ Availability?
‐ I'm available to Reese.

897
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:05,546
We're gonna have
to make a better showing.

898
00:34:05,579 --> 00:34:06,580
Alright.
I'll do better tomorrow.

899
00:34:06,613 --> 00:34:08,481
That's not gonna do it.

900
00:34:08,515 --> 00:34:10,216
Your hours are hurting us.

901
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,351
He's a surgeon.

902
00:34:11,384 --> 00:34:13,153
'It goes with the job.'

903
00:34:13,186 --> 00:34:14,320
Do you wanna keep your son?

904
00:34:14,354 --> 00:34:15,756
What do you think?

905
00:34:15,789 --> 00:34:17,724
That you need
to start setting priorities

906
00:34:17,758 --> 00:34:19,359
'and making some hard choices.'

907
00:34:19,392 --> 00:34:20,627
'That's what I think.'

908
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,601
How well do you know Andrew?

909
00:34:29,169 --> 00:34:30,370
What's that supposed to mean?

910
00:34:31,471 --> 00:34:33,774
Does he do drugs?

911
00:34:33,807 --> 00:34:35,609
‐ I don't think so.
‐ Are you sure?

912
00:34:40,814 --> 00:34:43,383
‐ What's this?
‐ Results of his tox screen.

913
00:34:43,416 --> 00:34:45,786
He tested positive
for marijuana.

914
00:34:45,819 --> 00:34:48,454
Aren't you supposed
to keep that confidential?

915
00:34:48,488 --> 00:34:49,890
Were you smoking with him?

916
00:34:49,923 --> 00:34:51,725
No.

917
00:34:51,758 --> 00:34:53,326
Have you ever smoked with him?

918
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,529
I wouldn't do that.

919
00:34:55,562 --> 00:34:56,730
Good.

920
00:34:56,763 --> 00:34:58,264
Then you'll test negative.

921
00:35:02,302 --> 00:35:04,404
Are you serious?

922
00:35:04,437 --> 00:35:05,572
You don't trust me?

923
00:35:05,606 --> 00:35:07,574
I trusted you to go home
after school.

924
00:35:07,608 --> 00:35:09,610
Dad, he was gonna
drop me off

925
00:35:09,643 --> 00:35:10,677
but then,
he wanted to stop.

926
00:35:10,711 --> 00:35:12,846
We agreed no rides.

927
00:35:12,879 --> 00:35:15,916
‐ I missed the bus.
‐ You should have called me.

928
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:17,483
I didn't wanna bother you.

929
00:35:19,452 --> 00:35:20,887
Sure didn't work out that way.

930
00:35:22,756 --> 00:35:24,891
You want me to pee in a cup?

931
00:35:24,925 --> 00:35:26,192
Yep.

932
00:35:28,328 --> 00:35:30,363
Yes, a gram of Ceftazidime.

933
00:35:30,396 --> 00:35:32,498
Michael, did the family choose
a mortuary yet?

934
00:35:32,533 --> 00:35:33,700
‐ What?
‐ Rudy Escalona.

935
00:35:33,734 --> 00:35:34,768
We need to get him
to the morgue.

936
00:35:34,801 --> 00:35:37,270
No. Not the ICU, the ER.
Thanks.

937
00:35:37,303 --> 00:35:38,371
Oh, you need me to do something?

938
00:35:38,404 --> 00:35:40,240
Ask Frank
for the decedent packet.

939
00:35:42,342 --> 00:35:43,810
‐ Luka?
‐ Hmm?

940
00:35:43,844 --> 00:35:47,213
You weren't here so I gave
Collins the gent first.

941
00:35:47,247 --> 00:35:48,615
Thanks.

942
00:35:48,649 --> 00:35:51,217
I...I had to go out.

943
00:35:51,251 --> 00:35:52,719
Everything okay?

944
00:35:52,753 --> 00:35:55,221
She's leaving town.

945
00:35:55,255 --> 00:35:56,723
‐ Why?
‐ I don't know.

946
00:35:56,757 --> 00:35:58,925
Dr. Kovac,
exam four's vomiting blood.

947
00:35:58,959 --> 00:36:00,961
What about the baby?

948
00:36:00,994 --> 00:36:02,362
There is no baby.

949
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,468
I started another line
on Zahler.

950
00:36:08,501 --> 00:36:09,903
Did you have a written order?

951
00:36:09,936 --> 00:36:11,638
It was right up there.

952
00:36:11,672 --> 00:36:14,641
Why was Abby about to discharge
my bowel obstruction?

953
00:36:14,675 --> 00:36:15,876
I have no idea.

954
00:36:15,909 --> 00:36:17,443
Because you can't write
between the lines.

955
00:36:17,477 --> 00:36:19,746
‐ Oh, sorry.
‐ 'Carter, is this one yours?

956
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,915
'Twenty five‐year‐old woman,
severe allergic reactions‐‐'

957
00:36:21,948 --> 00:36:23,884
‐ Mrs. Urman?
‐ 'Gave her 50 of Benadryl.'

958
00:36:23,917 --> 00:36:25,986
‐ What happened?
‐ I guess you were right.

959
00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:27,921
‐ We followed our bliss.
‐ Where?

960
00:36:27,954 --> 00:36:28,989
To our pickup truck.

961
00:36:29,022 --> 00:36:30,223
I figured we'd be safe right

962
00:36:30,256 --> 00:36:31,758
by the hospital, so, uh..

963
00:36:31,792 --> 00:36:33,660
I'll get her started.
300 of cimetidine.

964
00:36:33,694 --> 00:36:35,629
I will be right there.

965
00:36:35,662 --> 00:36:37,731
Ooh, that's a very nice suit.

966
00:36:37,764 --> 00:36:39,332
Thanks. I was in court all day.

967
00:36:39,365 --> 00:36:40,634
‐ A patient?
‐ No.

968
00:36:40,667 --> 00:36:42,936
‐ Something wrong?
‐ No. Everything's cool.

969
00:36:42,969 --> 00:36:44,671
Dr. Benton, they need you
in the OR.

970
00:36:48,942 --> 00:36:50,677
Mr. Escalona.

971
00:36:50,711 --> 00:36:53,547
Uh, if you'd like,
the nurse said

972
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,481
that we can make arrangements
for the funeral home.

973
00:36:57,551 --> 00:37:01,021
W‐we used, uh, Rose Hills
when his mother died.

974
00:37:01,054 --> 00:37:03,256
But I‐I never
thought that..

975
00:37:09,663 --> 00:37:11,832
He was a good kid.

976
00:37:11,865 --> 00:37:13,333
He made everybody smile.

977
00:37:14,835 --> 00:37:16,603
Jorge..

978
00:37:16,637 --> 00:37:17,904
'...he was the serious one.'

979
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,007
I didn't mean
to lose my temper.

980
00:37:22,676 --> 00:37:24,310
It's been a hard day,
you know?

981
00:37:25,812 --> 00:37:26,980
He doesn't wanna see me.

982
00:37:28,549 --> 00:37:29,783
He doesn't understand.

983
00:37:32,452 --> 00:37:34,287
You, uh, should give him
a shot.

984
00:37:35,922 --> 00:37:37,323
You know,
he might surprise you.

985
00:38:18,498 --> 00:38:19,766
Sorry to be brief

986
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,603
but my nanny gets off
in six minutes.

987
00:38:22,636 --> 00:38:24,671
Diane Pruitt,
GSW to the head.

988
00:38:24,705 --> 00:38:27,007
Transplant teams are flying
in from Indiana and Michigan.

989
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,775
‐ The gas station robbery.
‐ Yes.

990
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:30,911
Romano has agreed
to a non‐heart beating protocol.

991
00:38:30,944 --> 00:38:31,978
When did we start doing that?

992
00:38:32,012 --> 00:38:33,346
Today, apparently.

993
00:38:34,548 --> 00:38:35,849
That's the husband over there.

994
00:38:35,882 --> 00:38:36,917
If you could review
the procedure

995
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,418
with him once more?

996
00:38:38,451 --> 00:38:39,686
He's already consented, right?

997
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,721
Yeah, of course.

998
00:38:40,754 --> 00:38:42,623
So what is there to talk about?

999
00:38:42,656 --> 00:38:44,057
Uh, the man needs
some reassurance.

1000
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:46,527
Elizabeth, you had him
for 12 hours. You deal with him.

1001
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,328
He wants to talk
to the operating surgeon.

1002
00:38:50,163 --> 00:38:51,732
Peter, what's the matter?

1003
00:38:53,466 --> 00:38:54,601
Nothing. Go home.

1004
00:38:56,503 --> 00:38:58,839
Mr. Pruitt?
Hi.

1005
00:38:58,872 --> 00:39:01,374
I'm Dr. Benton. I'll be
coordinating the procedure.

1006
00:39:01,407 --> 00:39:02,909
As soon as the out‐of‐state team
gets here

1007
00:39:02,943 --> 00:39:04,545
we'll take her to the OR.

1008
00:39:04,578 --> 00:39:05,646
Okay.

1009
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:08,048
I, uh, I tried to explain it

1010
00:39:08,081 --> 00:39:11,151
to her, but, uh,
she's too young.

1011
00:39:11,184 --> 00:39:13,486
I don't know how
I'm gonna do this by myself.

1012
00:39:15,188 --> 00:39:18,124
Well, you'll do the best
you can.

1013
00:39:18,158 --> 00:39:21,461
You're supposed
to be on light duty.

1014
00:39:21,494 --> 00:39:22,629
I was moving some gear.

1015
00:39:22,663 --> 00:39:24,998
No, you went on a run.

1016
00:39:25,031 --> 00:39:27,467
I get a little stir crazy.

1017
00:39:28,669 --> 00:39:30,070
Okay.

1018
00:39:30,103 --> 00:39:32,639
Looks pretty good,
no sign of infection.

1019
00:39:32,673 --> 00:39:34,074
That's it?

1020
00:39:34,107 --> 00:39:35,942
No. You need a new bandage.

1021
00:39:41,114 --> 00:39:43,617
So, is, uh..

1022
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:46,653
...Captain Devlin
still at the seven‐five?

1023
00:39:46,687 --> 00:39:48,488
I know the name.

1024
00:39:48,522 --> 00:39:49,790
Yeah, those guys
used to hang out

1025
00:39:49,823 --> 00:39:52,726
at a place called
the, um, Moose and Squirrel.

1026
00:39:52,759 --> 00:39:55,495
Yeah. Every Friday night.

1027
00:39:55,529 --> 00:39:56,797
That was a fun place.

1028
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:00,767
Uh, you should have someone

1029
00:40:00,801 --> 00:40:03,469
remove the stitches
in four days.

1030
00:40:03,504 --> 00:40:04,838
I know where to find you.

1031
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:11,745
Listen, Sandy..

1032
00:40:11,778 --> 00:40:13,213
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1033
00:40:13,246 --> 00:40:14,915
‐ Oh, I bunched it up.
‐ That's alright.

1034
00:40:14,948 --> 00:40:16,149
What were you saying?

1035
00:40:17,684 --> 00:40:18,885
Do you wanna do something?

1036
00:40:20,153 --> 00:40:21,755
Excuse me?

1037
00:40:21,788 --> 00:40:23,724
Uh, sometime?
You know, something.

1038
00:40:24,891 --> 00:40:26,059
Something?

1039
00:40:26,092 --> 00:40:27,493
Uh, I don't know.

1040
00:40:27,528 --> 00:40:30,531
Lunch, or a movie,
or ice fishing?

1041
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,803
‐ Like, go out?
‐ Yeah.

1042
00:40:36,837 --> 00:40:39,873
I mean, unless I'm totally
off base here.

1043
00:40:39,906 --> 00:40:41,575
No.

1044
00:40:41,608 --> 00:40:42,976
No, you're on base.

1045
00:40:49,015 --> 00:40:50,751
How's it going?

1046
00:40:50,784 --> 00:40:52,886
Fine.

1047
00:40:52,919 --> 00:40:55,221
Your drug screen came back.

1048
00:40:55,255 --> 00:40:56,690
Everything was negative.

1049
00:40:58,158 --> 00:40:59,660
Don't look so disappointed.

1050
00:41:05,832 --> 00:41:06,900
I know you're upset.

1051
00:41:09,002 --> 00:41:10,737
But I had to do this

1052
00:41:10,771 --> 00:41:12,105
because I want you to be safe.

1053
00:41:13,974 --> 00:41:15,809
I care more about that

1054
00:41:15,842 --> 00:41:17,844
than about your being angry
with me.

1055
00:41:21,548 --> 00:41:22,983
I wanna be able
to trust you.

1056
00:41:25,652 --> 00:41:27,253
It's something we both
have to work at.

1057
00:41:29,656 --> 00:41:30,857
Can I go now?

1058
00:41:34,695 --> 00:41:36,830
‐ Is the recipient ready?
‐ Yeah. All I need is a liver.

1059
00:41:36,863 --> 00:41:38,765
Alright. The heart team
gets first crack.

1060
00:41:38,799 --> 00:41:40,100
But tell them
to make it snappy.

1061
00:41:42,002 --> 00:41:44,004
Sternal saw's up.

1062
00:41:44,037 --> 00:41:46,106
Open the O Dexon,
atraumatic needle.

1063
00:41:47,273 --> 00:41:49,776
‐ All set?
‐ 'Good to go.'

1064
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:51,645
After two minutes
of cardiac arrest

1065
00:41:51,678 --> 00:41:53,113
I'll call it, and then
we'll begin procurement.

1066
00:41:53,146 --> 00:41:54,314
How's her oxygenation?

1067
00:41:54,347 --> 00:41:55,816
'Fine. Satting at 100 percent.'

1068
00:41:55,849 --> 00:41:57,751
'Good. Turn it off.'

1069
00:41:57,784 --> 00:42:00,253
Respiratory support
discontinued at 20:37.

1070
00:42:04,858 --> 00:42:07,260
Oh, they're sweet.
I hope they get pregnant.

1071
00:42:07,293 --> 00:42:08,629
Shouldn't be a problem.

1072
00:42:08,662 --> 00:42:10,130
The endocrinologist can wash
the sperm

1073
00:42:10,163 --> 00:42:12,065
and then it's safe
to artificially inseminate.

1074
00:42:12,098 --> 00:42:14,267
Hmm.
That's a new one.

1075
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:17,638
Just goes to teach you
never to doubt my diagnoses.

1076
00:42:17,671 --> 00:42:20,140
Yeah, no matter
how loony they are.

1077
00:42:20,173 --> 00:42:21,708
I can't believe
they did it

1078
00:42:21,742 --> 00:42:23,877
in the back
of a pickup truck.

1079
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:25,912
‐ They had a camper shell.
‐ How do you know?

1080
00:42:25,946 --> 00:42:27,147
‐ I saw it.
‐ You did?

1081
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,214
Yes. In the front
of the hospital.

1082
00:42:28,248 --> 00:42:30,083
It's their honeymoon suite.

1083
00:42:30,116 --> 00:42:31,284
Very weird.

1084
00:42:31,317 --> 00:42:32,318
Not so weird.

1085
00:42:32,352 --> 00:42:33,820
Ferris wheel, that's weird.

1086
00:42:35,288 --> 00:42:37,724
‐ Really?
‐ I‐I was young.

1087
00:42:37,758 --> 00:42:39,860
It was my first real boyfriend.

1088
00:42:41,695 --> 00:42:42,863
Where else?

1089
00:42:42,896 --> 00:42:44,130
Your turn.

1090
00:42:44,164 --> 00:42:46,266
Camping. Where else?

1091
00:42:46,299 --> 00:42:48,869
In a tent? That's the best
you can do?

1092
00:42:48,902 --> 00:42:49,970
Uh..

1093
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,776
On a train to Seattle.

1094
00:42:55,809 --> 00:42:58,244
Really?
With who?

1095
00:42:58,278 --> 00:43:00,180
I was by myself..

1096
00:43:00,213 --> 00:43:01,347
...but it was memorable.

1097
00:43:07,654 --> 00:43:09,389
Mm. It's cold.

1098
00:43:09,422 --> 00:43:11,391
Yeah. We should probably go in.

1099
00:43:11,424 --> 00:43:12,759
Yeah.

1100
00:43:22,102 --> 00:43:24,270
Carter..

1101
00:43:24,304 --> 00:43:26,673
You don't have any allergies
I should know about, do you?

1102
00:43:32,045 --> 00:43:33,046
Oops.

1103
00:43:34,848 --> 00:43:35,982
Where were we?

1104
00:43:37,684 --> 00:43:39,920
‐ How long has it been?
‐ Forty nine minutes.

1105
00:43:39,953 --> 00:43:41,888
Tissues could be
getting ischemic.

1106
00:43:41,922 --> 00:43:44,925
Alright, let's send an ABG,
lytes and a lactate.

1107
00:43:44,958 --> 00:43:45,959
Who's in charge here?

1108
00:43:45,992 --> 00:43:47,227
I ordered liver an hour ago

1109
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:49,730
and I haven't seen my waitress
since.

1110
00:43:49,763 --> 00:43:51,131
The patient's breathing
on her own.

1111
00:43:51,164 --> 00:43:53,800
Ugh. How inconsiderate.

1112
00:43:53,834 --> 00:43:55,235
Well, this could take hours.

1113
00:43:55,268 --> 00:43:57,771
Page me when she goes.

1114
00:43:57,804 --> 00:43:59,339
What do you wanna do,
Dr. Benton?

1115
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,048
Let's just wait.
