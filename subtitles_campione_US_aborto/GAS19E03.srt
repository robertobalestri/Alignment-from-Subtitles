00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:08,774
one of the more common reasons

00:00:08,859 --> 00:00:11,421
<i>women visited the doctor
was "hysteria."</i>

4
00:00:11,506 --> 00:00:14,204
Granny, I don't know where
your nice shoes are,

5
00:00:14,289 --> 00:00:16,125
but aren't you staying home?

6
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,634
Can't you just wear
your slippers?

7
00:00:17,718 --> 00:00:19,136
Well, what about
next weekend?

8
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,226
<i>I'm in Miami</i>

9
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:22,109
<i>for a National Conference
on Neuroscience.</i>

10
00:00:22,257 --> 00:00:24,804
Miami is a six-hour flight
from Seattle.

11
00:00:24,898 --> 00:00:26,602
I could get on the red eye
Friday night.

12
00:00:26,687 --> 00:00:27,984
We'd have
all of Saturday,

13
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:30,773
and then I could fly back Sunday
in time to pick up Scout.

14
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,992
- Is that insane?
<i>- A little.</i>

15
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,274
I wish I could get on a plane
to Minnesota right now.

16
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:36,843
<i>I'm not in Minnesota.</i>

17
00:00:36,928 --> 00:00:39,764
You're not?
Where are you?

00:00:39,849 --> 00:00:41,968

Hi.

26
00:01:00,131 --> 00:01:02,584
<i>They tried a variety
of treatments for hysteria,</i>

27
00:01:02,724 --> 00:01:05,576
<i>ranging from rest

00:01:05,661 --> 00:01:08,123
Please can I watch
your bowel resection?

29
00:01:08,627 --> 00:01:10,545
You stay home from school,
you keep up with your work.

30
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:11,615
That was our deal.

31
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,217
I will never need to know
anything about

32
00:01:13,302 --> 00:01:14,686
the French Revolution,
ever.

33
00:01:14,771 --> 00:01:15,756
If you only know
about medicine,

34
00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:17,159
what will you talk
to your patients about?

35
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:19,131
You talk to your patients
about European history?

36
00:01:19,216 --> 00:01:21,358
<i>But true relief for these women
didn't exist...</i>

37
00:01:21,443 --> 00:01:23,107
I have to catch up
with Maggie and Nick.

38
00:01:23,192 --> 00:01:24,909
Go to my office.
I'll see you soon, okay?

39
00:01:24,994 --> 00:01:26,592
<i>...until physicians tried using</i>

40
00:01:26,677 --> 00:01:28,600
<i>what they called
pelvic massage.</i>

41
00:01:28,685 --> 00:01:30,396
Hey. Zola's skipping
school again today.

42
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:32,022
Well, she had another
panic attack,

43
00:01:32,107 --> 00:01:33,599
so what was
I supposed to do?

44
00:01:33,684 --> 00:01:36,763
<i>The cure was called
a "hysterical paroxysm"...</i>

45
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:39,811
Wow.
What are you doing here?

46
00:01:39,896 --> 00:01:41,967
None of your business.
I'm a private citizen.

47
00:01:42,052 --> 00:01:45,131
<i>...which today has come
to be known as an orgasm.</i>

48
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:49,069
Uh, yeah, I may have, uh, given
her and Dr. Wilson permission

49
00:01:49,154 --> 00:01:51,326
to use the interns
for a special project.

50
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:53,888
You gave away our surgical
interns for the entire day?

51
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:57,154
Well, I mean, the project's
important, and...

52
00:01:57,255 --> 00:01:58,839
do you really want
to tell Bailey no?

53
00:01:58,978 --> 00:02:01,097
<i>Modern medicine continues
to recognize</i>

54
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:03,940
<i>the stress-reducing benefits
of the female orgasm.</i>

55
00:02:04,025 --> 00:02:06,303
<i>But doctors no longer
perform the cure.</i>

56
00:02:06,388 --> 00:02:07,701
Sign these.

57
00:02:07,786 --> 00:02:09,091
What are they?

58
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,671
Release forms.

59
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:12,316
- For what?
- Okay, new rule...

60
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,209
No questions before 8:00 a.m.

61
00:02:14,294 --> 00:02:16,879
- Well, we just want to know what we...
- Save it for 8:01.

62
00:02:16,998 --> 00:02:18,850
I'll be in the pit
if you desperately need me

63
00:02:18,935 --> 00:02:20,639
and there is absolutely
no one else

64
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:22,224
in your general vicinity
who can help.

65
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:25,682
- Okay, but where...
- People, it's very simple... no questions.

66
00:02:25,767 --> 00:02:27,295
You just didn't tell us
where we're going.

67
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,698
- You're with Dr. Bailey.
- Who's Dr. Bailey?

68
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,561
Wow, blasphemy.

69
00:02:31,646 --> 00:02:32,803
I am Dr. Bailey.

70
00:02:35,591 --> 00:02:37,451
What are you waiting for?
Let's go.

71
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,742
I'm so sorry.

72
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:40,344
I-I thought I met
all the attendings.

73
00:02:40,428 --> 00:02:41,560
I'm Mika Yasuda.

74
00:02:41,645 --> 00:02:43,479
No need to apologize.
I don't work here.

75
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:47,083
Dr. Bailey was chief of surgery
until about six months ago.

76
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,046
I left to spend time
with my family.

77
00:02:49,131 --> 00:02:49,951
That's nice.

78
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:52,355
It was, and then
the Supreme Court went

79
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,732
and stripped women
of our reproductive rights.

80
00:02:54,817 --> 00:02:58,210
Dr. Wilson has been helping me
with a sex-ed curriculum

81
00:02:58,295 --> 00:02:59,996
to teach teenagers
about their bodies

82
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,931
because we now live
in a country

83
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,533
where the only way
to guarantee

84
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:06,177
you don't have to carry
an unwanted pregnancy

85
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:07,504
is to not get pregnant.

86
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:09,038
And
statistically speaking,

87
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:11,708
teens need some big help
with that.

88
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:14,611
So we are making
sex-education videos

89
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:15,845
to put up on social media.

90
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:17,045
We want to go viral...

91
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,435
You know, like that cat
that plays the piano.

92
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,017
Oh, come on, people,
get with it.

93
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:22,452
Dr. Bailey,
we're surgical interns.

94
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,530
We have progress notes
and nurses paging us,

95
00:03:24,615 --> 00:03:26,055
and we're behind
on discharge summaries.

96
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,657
I don't even have time
to look at my phone.

97
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,459
I've got
like 600 unread texts.

98
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,461
Nurses love me.
You won't be bothered today.

99
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:34,030
And in exchange
for your cooperation,

100
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:36,233
you get the benefit
of working

101
00:03:36,317 --> 00:03:40,136
with yet another
world-class surgeon.

102
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:45,271
Dr. Montgomery.

103
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:51,548
Oh, don't look so miserable.

104
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:53,998
You're getting paid
to talk about sex today.

105
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:57,021
Sex is fun, and I need you
to look like it.

And I am
so grateful.

112
00:04:24,753 --> 00:04:27,064
Well, I spend
every waking moment

113
00:04:27,149 --> 00:04:29,282
obsessing about the state of
women's health in this country,

114
00:04:29,368 --> 00:04:30,665
so this was an easy yes.

115
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,589
Yeah. How much fallout are you
experiencing in California?

116
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:36,150
Last week,
I had five patients

117
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:38,794
asking for prophylactic
tubal ligations

118
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,230
before they go
to college,

119
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:41,642
because they're afraid
of getting pregnant

120
00:04:41,767 --> 00:04:42,634
in hostile states.

121
00:04:42,719 --> 00:04:44,867
18-year-olds wanting to get
their tubes tied.

122
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:47,087
I mean,
it's the actual apocalypse.

123
00:04:47,172 --> 00:04:50,415
18? I didn't even want kids
until I was 30.

124
00:04:51,092 --> 00:04:52,777
Hi.
I'm Jo Wilson.

125
00:04:52,862 --> 00:04:54,713
We actually met during
your grand rounds

126
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:56,001
on uterine transplants.

127
00:04:56,086 --> 00:04:59,009
And Dr. Schmitt is a g...
is a good friend of mine.

128
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:00,918
Unless you didn't like him.
Then I hate him.

129
00:05:01,003 --> 00:05:03,197
Dr. Wilson,
I've heard great things.

130
00:05:03,282 --> 00:05:04,392
Ugh...

131
00:05:04,477 --> 00:05:06,400
- Would you excuse me just a minute?
- Mm-hmm. - Sure.

132
00:05:08,845 --> 00:05:11,657
I cannot believe it.
Shep...

133
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:13,596
Dr. Montgomery.

134
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:16,282
It's a... an... an honor
to be working with you.

135
00:05:16,367 --> 00:05:19,286
I'm... I'm a huge fan of...
of... of fertility

Dr... Dr. Simone Griffith.

139
00:05:27,078 --> 00:05:28,462
Sorry, I'm starstruck.

140
00:05:37,258 --> 00:05:38,842
What do you mean,
I don't have any interns?

141
00:05:38,986 --> 00:05:40,228
They're off on some
special assignment.

142
00:05:40,313 --> 00:05:42,491
Well, what, did they enlist?
Bring them back, Owen.

143
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:44,628
I have a full pit,
one surgical resident,

144
00:05:44,712 --> 00:05:46,643
and you, who's worse
than useless to me.

145
00:05:46,728 --> 00:05:47,964
You know what?
Talk to someone who cares.

146
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:50,133
- Oh, excuse me, Dr. Altman.
- What?

147
00:05:50,282 --> 00:05:53,002
Well, as much as I respect
the purpose

148
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,462
and intention
of Dr. Bailey's project,

149
00:05:54,547 --> 00:05:57,266
I could really use some more
hands-on experience in the pit.

150
00:05:57,351 --> 00:06:00,544
I'll do H&Ps, run labs, suture,
drain abscesses.

151
00:06:00,628 --> 00:06:01,650
I'll do anything
you need.

152
00:06:01,735 --> 00:06:04,307
Mm. You happy now?
Don't answer that.

153
00:06:04,392 --> 00:06:05,525
You're never happy.

154
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,282
I'm a very happy person.
He's just bitter and broken.

155
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:09,907
Let's go.

156
00:06:09,992 --> 00:06:12,555
These are your scripts.
Stick to them.

157
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:17,060
STDs, menstrual cycle,
anatomy,

158
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:18,695
and you're all
on contraception.

159
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:20,554
Uh, Dr. Webber,
there's plenty to go around.

160
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,257
Would you like to
pick a topic? Richard?

161
00:06:22,412 --> 00:06:25,831
Uh, when I was 15,
I was handed a sack of flour

162
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:28,148
to care
and treat like a baby.

163
00:06:28,233 --> 00:06:29,917
Do you have that?

164
00:06:30,476 --> 00:06:31,992
I'll be in my office.

165
00:06:32,077 --> 00:06:34,930
Alright, uh, any questions,
comments, concerns?

166
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:37,413
Um, yeah.

167
00:06:37,506 --> 00:06:41,260
This is very important and all,
but I am not your guy.

168
00:06:41,344 --> 00:06:43,109
Never had sex before?

169
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:46,202
This is your assignment today,
so you are our guy.

170
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,624
I think what Dr. Kwan
is trying to say is, uh,

171
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:50,394
we're not
exactly qualified for this.

172
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:52,228
Yeah.
Okay, do you understand

173
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:54,498
that hundreds of thousands
of teenagers

174
00:06:54,582 --> 00:06:55,624
will become pregnant
this year?

175
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:57,992
And now a lot of
those children

176
00:06:58,093 --> 00:07:00,952
will be forced
to carry their babies to term,

177
00:07:01,037 --> 00:07:04,772
or worse, give themselves
back-alley illegal abortions,

178
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:06,523
get septic, and die.

179
00:07:06,608 --> 00:07:09,260
So if you all want to go hold
a retractor, go ahead.

180
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,996
The rest of us will be here
saving lives.

181
00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:13,366
Hmm.

182
00:07:13,477 --> 00:07:16,195
Oh, s-so, we just talk
into the camera?

183
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,734
Not quite.
Come on in.

184
00:07:17,924 --> 00:07:21,008
I've organized volunteers
at my son's high school.

185
00:07:21,093 --> 00:07:22,258
Actual nightmare.

186
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:23,460
No.

187
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,046
Can't teach
without students.

188
00:07:25,221 --> 00:07:27,913
- Hi.
- Hi, everybody.

189
00:07:28,396 --> 00:07:30,023
- There we go.
- Hi.

190
00:07:37,803 --> 00:07:39,484
Excuse me, young man.

191
00:07:39,578 --> 00:07:41,195
Where's labor and delivery?

192
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,320
- Are you looking for someone?
- Yes, my daughter.

193
00:07:43,405 --> 00:07:45,952
Her name is Denise.
Have you seen her?

194
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,913
No. Um...

195
00:07:47,998 --> 00:07:51,273
She's having my grand baby today.
I brought sustenance.

196
00:07:51,358 --> 00:07:53,726
Hey, Adams!
Come here.

197
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:57,257
Um, this is, uh...

198
00:07:57,342 --> 00:07:58,793
Joyce... Joyce Ward.

199
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:00,129
Can you help her
find her daughter?

200
00:08:00,214 --> 00:08:02,199
She's in labor.
Can't an orderly do that?

201
00:08:02,902 --> 00:08:04,406
You want to go back
to sex class?

202
00:08:06,707 --> 00:08:08,492
Please follow me, ma'am.

203
00:08:09,804 --> 00:08:11,054
- Hey.
- Yeah?

204
00:08:11,154 --> 00:08:13,772
Uh, is it true that you, uh,
gave away the surgical interns?

205
00:08:14,052 --> 00:08:15,874
Yeah, it's just for one day,
though.

206
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,038
How much of the day?

207
00:08:17,123 --> 00:08:18,795
'Cause I need them to round
on Maggie's patients.

208
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,406
Otherwise, I'll need to round
on her patients,

209
00:08:20,491 --> 00:08:21,974
- as well as my own patients.
- Right.

210
00:08:22,059 --> 00:08:23,296
What are they even doing?

211
00:08:23,381 --> 00:08:27,101
Uh, sex videos to prevent
teen pregnancy.

212
00:08:27,186 --> 00:08:28,604
Sex videos?

213
00:08:28,689 --> 00:08:32,376
Uh, no.
Uh, sex-education videos.

214
00:08:32,463 --> 00:08:33,562
Oh, okay, well, that...

215
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:35,320
That's an important word
in that sentence.

216
00:08:35,405 --> 00:08:36,351
It is.

217
00:08:36,436 --> 00:08:38,390
Okay, I guess
I'll start rounds, then.

218
00:08:38,475 --> 00:08:39,925
- Okay.
- Okay.

219
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,101
<i>Dr. Seip, 4617.</i>

220
00:08:42,186 --> 00:08:44,648
<i>Dr. Jen Seip, 4617.</i>

221
00:08:46,665 --> 00:08:49,406
Hey.
What you doing down here?

222
00:08:49,491 --> 00:08:51,576
Uh, just going
to the bathroom.

223
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,177
Y-You're going
to the bathroom?

224
00:08:53,262 --> 00:08:55,132
You walked across
a pedestrian bridge,

225
00:08:55,217 --> 00:08:56,890
you took an elevator
down three flights,

226
00:08:56,975 --> 00:08:58,760
when there's a bathroom
in your mom's office?

227
00:08:58,869 --> 00:09:01,148
That's what that door is?

228
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:02,843
What's up?

229
00:09:02,928 --> 00:09:05,765
Okay, fine, I was looking for
a gallery to watch surgery.

230
00:09:05,961 --> 00:09:07,212
Ah. Please don't tell my mom.

231
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,327
I can't do more
history homework. I can't.

232
00:09:09,456 --> 00:09:11,679
Yeah, well, I never really liked
history either.

233
00:09:11,764 --> 00:09:13,115
All the battles
you have to memorize,

234
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,773
the old dudes
with the wigs.

235
00:09:14,858 --> 00:09:16,077
Who thought
that looked good?

236
00:09:16,162 --> 00:09:19,348
Okay, well, I don't have to be
in surgery for a few hours.

237
00:09:20,632 --> 00:09:22,296
You want to see
something cool?

238
00:09:22,381 --> 00:09:24,163
Okay, let's go.

239
00:09:24,818 --> 00:09:27,835
Track your menstrual
cycle with pen and paper, no apps.

240
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,629
If you get an abortion,
hostile states might be able

241
00:09:30,714 --> 00:09:33,242
to use your phone as evidence
against you in criminal court.

242
00:09:33,327 --> 00:09:36,890
If your period is late,
take a pregnancy test.

243
00:09:36,979 --> 00:09:39,698
Um, medical abortions
are still, uh,

244
00:09:39,783 --> 00:09:42,301
legal and available
in many states.

245
00:09:42,386 --> 00:09:44,163
But, um, uh...

246
00:09:44,248 --> 00:09:46,437
But you have to know
that you're pregnant early

247
00:09:46,577 --> 00:09:47,632
if you want to use it.

248
00:09:47,717 --> 00:09:49,945
Take one birth control pill
by mouth

249
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,548
every day at the same time.

250
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,751
Or you can get an IUD
or an implant.

251
00:09:53,874 --> 00:09:57,994
IUD goes into the uterus.
An implant goes into your arm.

252
00:09:58,296 --> 00:10:02,049
Both are 99% effective
at preventing pregnancy.

253
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:03,718
Morning-after pill.

254
00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:08,757
Uh, if the first layer
of contraception fails,

255
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:12,129
take this as soon as possible
to, um, prevent pregnancy.

256
00:10:12,932 --> 00:10:15,890
Oh, look, see, that girl over
there is paying attention.

257
00:10:15,975 --> 00:10:18,507
Oh, wait, no,
I just didn't see her phone.

258
00:10:18,592 --> 00:10:20,429
"Get young people,"
you said.

259
00:10:20,514 --> 00:10:22,773
"They'll be good at this,"
you said.

260
00:10:29,114 --> 00:10:31,242
I know. I am sorry.

261
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,632
I forgot.
I've got too much going on.

262
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,945
Well, I will do it tonight
when I can't sleep.

263
00:10:37,842 --> 00:10:39,593
Look, can we talk
about this later, please?

264
00:10:39,678 --> 00:10:41,630
Okay. Bye. I love you.

265
00:10:43,117 --> 00:10:44,258
Hey.

266
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:46,124
Are you okay?

267
00:10:47,054 --> 00:10:49,273
Do you remember
when the state fair was?

268
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:50,627
Was it three weeks ago?

269
00:10:50,712 --> 00:10:53,430
Oh, I'm sorry, I don't.
I don't live here.

270
00:10:54,006 --> 00:10:55,742
Doesn't matter.

271
00:10:55,979 --> 00:10:57,397
Either way, it's late.

272
00:10:57,614 --> 00:10:59,115
What's late?

273
00:11:02,314 --> 00:11:03,773
Oh.

274
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:08,960
Okay, well, um,
your period can be late

275
00:11:09,045 --> 00:11:10,827
for all sorts of reasons.

276
00:11:11,188 --> 00:11:14,077
But if you want, I can take you
for a blood test,

277
00:11:14,162 --> 00:11:15,695
just to be sure.

278
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,426
Are you a doctor?

279
00:11:17,674 --> 00:11:19,357
Yes, I am a doctor.

280
00:11:19,442 --> 00:11:20,906
And you won't tell
my parents?

281
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,218
No, this is between
you and me.

282
00:11:27,939 --> 00:11:29,056
I... Okay, I get it.

283
00:11:29,141 --> 00:11:30,242
Did you tell the coordinator

284
00:11:30,327 --> 00:11:32,345
that the patient's
a rare HLA match?

285
00:11:32,553 --> 00:11:35,472
Okay, well, call them back
and send the latest labs.

286
00:11:35,557 --> 00:11:36,859
Thank you.

287
00:11:36,944 --> 00:11:39,359
Okay, what you want to do
is you take the left grasper

288
00:11:39,444 --> 00:11:42,937
and pass the peg
to the right grasper.

289
00:11:43,022 --> 00:11:44,148
Huh.

290
00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:46,648
Did I do it wrong?

291
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:49,085
No, you did it,
uh, seamlessly.

292
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,894
You sure your mom's
never shown you this before?

293
00:11:51,035 --> 00:11:52,186
- No, I swear.
- No?

294
00:11:52,271 --> 00:11:53,937
Okay, well,
I'm not gonna tell you

295
00:11:54,022 --> 00:11:55,557
how long it took
for me to nail that.

296
00:11:58,282 --> 00:12:01,164
Did you always know
you wanted to be a doctor?

297
00:12:01,249 --> 00:12:03,413
Me?
Wow.

298
00:12:03,498 --> 00:12:05,195
Uh, no.
Gosh, no.

299
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:08,361
Um, at first
I wanted to be the Flash.

300
00:12:08,446 --> 00:12:10,031
I thought he was underrated
but cool.

301
00:12:10,122 --> 00:12:12,304
Then I thought I was gonna
play professional baseball.

302
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:13,445
That did not work out.

303
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:17,554
And, uh, then I decided I was
gonna be a science teacher.

304
00:12:18,426 --> 00:12:20,742
And then what happened?

305
00:12:21,026 --> 00:12:23,913
Well, um...
Well, my mom died.

306
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,197
You know, I forgot one.

307
00:12:28,282 --> 00:12:30,796
At one point, I was gonna be
an astronaut.

308
00:12:31,169 --> 00:12:32,718
You liked space?

309
00:12:32,803 --> 00:12:35,023
Uh, no,
I liked the ice cream.

310
00:12:35,123 --> 00:12:36,617
What?

311
00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:39,850
Where is your enthusiasm,

312
00:12:39,935 --> 00:12:41,585
your... your passion
for science?

313
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,507
We're losing them.

314
00:12:42,592 --> 00:12:44,070
We're reading all the facts
you gave us.

315
00:12:44,155 --> 00:12:45,398
You've turned it
into ASMR.

316
00:12:45,483 --> 00:12:47,001
You need to modulate
your voices.

317
00:12:47,086 --> 00:12:48,179
You know, connect!

318
00:12:48,264 --> 00:12:50,914
If I wanted someone to just read
facts from a sheet of paper,

319
00:12:50,999 --> 00:12:52,116
I could have
done that myself.

320
00:12:52,201 --> 00:12:53,929
Respectfully, we are not
the problem.

321
00:12:54,014 --> 00:12:56,166
These are boring factoids
that you could look up online.

322
00:12:56,251 --> 00:12:58,499
We need to teach these kids
something they want to learn about,

323
00:12:58,584 --> 00:13:00,602
engage their
sexual curiosity.

324
00:13:00,687 --> 00:13:03,665
No. Dr. Wilson wrote
a thorough curriculum.

325
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,134
Just stick
with the script.

326
00:13:05,219 --> 00:13:07,237
Be better.

327
00:13:07,322 --> 00:13:09,140
Aah!

328
00:13:09,225 --> 00:13:10,907
Hey, hey, can you tell us
what hurts?

329
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,306
She's tachy.

330
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:15,385
And she feels warm.
Uh, get me a gurney right now.

331
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,626
Dr. Wilson...

332
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,915
Wow. It's basically
like a video game.

333
00:13:23,109 --> 00:13:24,306
10 years of training,

334
00:13:24,451 --> 00:13:26,369
and I could have just been
playing a video game.

335
00:13:26,454 --> 00:13:28,157
I don't think they made this
back then.

336
00:13:28,242 --> 00:13:31,629
Wow!
Ouch. Okay.

337
00:13:32,235 --> 00:13:33,712
Mind if I use
one of these tables?

338
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,915
Oh, hey. I didn't...
I didn't know you were here.

339
00:13:36,045 --> 00:13:37,759
Oh, I came up last minute
to see Amelia.

340
00:13:37,844 --> 00:13:39,493
Thought I'd do some
data analysis

341
00:13:39,578 --> 00:13:40,720
until she's finished
with work.

342
00:13:40,805 --> 00:13:42,056
How's the, uh...
How's the trial?

343
00:13:42,141 --> 00:13:43,892
We are hoping to start
the next phase

344
00:13:44,027 --> 00:13:45,439
in the next
couple of months

345
00:13:45,532 --> 00:13:48,454
if David doesn't fire
this latest research director.

346
00:13:48,539 --> 00:13:49,267
Yes.

347
00:13:49,352 --> 00:13:51,399
Meredith Grey is not easy
to replace.

348
00:13:51,484 --> 00:13:54,657
No. No, she's not.
She's not.

349
00:13:54,843 --> 00:13:56,261
- How's the new gig?
- I like it.

350
00:13:56,346 --> 00:13:57,563
I think
I'm pretty good at it.

351
00:13:57,648 --> 00:13:59,454
Uh, Zola,
what do you think?

352
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,724
Mom says you take big swings.

353
00:14:03,828 --> 00:14:05,446
Did you do that
just now?

354
00:14:05,992 --> 00:14:08,561
Mm-hmm.
Is it okay?

355
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:11,595
That's a cognitive puzzle.

356
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,732
Most adults can't do it
that fast.

357
00:14:14,366 --> 00:14:15,485
Hmm.

358
00:14:16,503 --> 00:14:18,988
You know, I have six
other grandchildren.

359
00:14:19,073 --> 00:14:20,624
But Denise is my baby.

360
00:14:20,825 --> 00:14:22,814
She needs me with her.

361
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:25,117
Uh, excuse me.
We're looking for Denise Ward.

362
00:14:25,202 --> 00:14:26,620
This is her mother.

363
00:14:26,705 --> 00:14:29,023
Griffith...
Denise Griffith.

364
00:14:29,108 --> 00:14:30,353
She took
her husband's name.

365
00:14:30,438 --> 00:14:32,289
I'm not an O.B. nurse.

366
00:14:32,374 --> 00:14:34,192
And you have a tablet
in your armpit.

367
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,175
Just...

368
00:14:37,852 --> 00:14:39,868
Are you sure
Denise came here?

369
00:14:39,968 --> 00:14:41,493
Uh, maybe she went to
Seattle Pres.

370
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:44,462
No, no, she said
Seattle Grace.

371
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,433
Uh, okay, got it.

372
00:14:47,518 --> 00:14:49,798
Just give me a minute
to find your daughter's chart.

373
00:14:49,954 --> 00:14:52,626
You know, if they have a boy,
they're gonna name him Calvin.

374
00:14:52,711 --> 00:14:55,704
I don't love it,
but I'm staying out of it.

375
00:14:55,789 --> 00:14:59,157
I hope it's a girl,
'cause if they have a girl,

376
00:14:59,242 --> 00:15:00,926
they're gonna
name her Simone.

377
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,720
Isn't that beautiful?

378
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,126
Simone.

379
00:15:06,727 --> 00:15:08,876
Did we get a hold
of her parents?

380
00:15:08,961 --> 00:15:10,032
Mom's on the way.

381
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:12,337
She also said it could
just be bad cramps,

382
00:15:12,422 --> 00:15:16,142
because Diamond has
"extremely traumatic periods."

383
00:15:16,227 --> 00:15:17,924
"Traumatic"
or "dramatic"?

384
00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:20,233
It's unclear.

385
00:15:20,439 --> 00:15:22,384
Diamond,
are you on your period?

386
00:15:22,469 --> 00:15:23,696
Did my mom
tell you that?

387
00:15:23,781 --> 00:15:26,360
She tells everyone when
I'm on my freaking period.

388
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,862
I get a bad grade
on a math quiz,

389
00:15:27,947 --> 00:15:29,579
she tells my teacher
I'm on my period.

390
00:15:29,664 --> 00:15:31,571
Like, we bleed.
Why does it matter?

391
00:15:31,778 --> 00:15:36,032
I'm the virgin who likes anime,
who passed out

392
00:15:36,117 --> 00:15:38,071
during sex-ed class.

393
00:15:38,286 --> 00:15:39,671
Wow!

394
00:15:39,756 --> 00:15:42,431
That's a giant cyst
on the left side.

395
00:15:42,516 --> 00:15:44,978
Look, it's... it's displaced
her entire abdomen.

396
00:15:45,063 --> 00:15:46,881
And look, whirlpool sign
on the right.

397
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:50,065
The vasculature is twisted,
suggesting ovarian torsion.

398
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,501
She'll need surgery
right away.

399
00:15:51,586 --> 00:15:52,770
Well, then let's go.

400
00:15:52,855 --> 00:15:54,899
Book an O.R.
and call her parents.

401
00:15:54,984 --> 00:15:57,337
Dr. DeLuca is still
in her hysterectomy.

402
00:15:57,422 --> 00:15:59,228
I have never done one of these
on my own.

403
00:15:59,313 --> 00:16:00,892
Well, good thing we know
someone who has.

404
00:16:00,977 --> 00:16:04,230
Find Dr. Montgomery.
She's gonna need privileges.

405
00:16:04,446 --> 00:16:06,029
So are you.

406
00:16:07,035 --> 00:16:10,355
Double up
to protect against STDs.

407
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,782
The pill and a condom,
an IUD and a condom,

408
00:16:13,867 --> 00:16:17,782
but never use two condoms
at the same time.

409
00:16:17,867 --> 00:16:19,952
They'll break, and you...

410
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,454
Ooh!
Could get pregnant.

411
00:16:22,722 --> 00:16:25,559
What are you doing?
Just got paged to the pit. Bye!

412
00:16:27,525 --> 00:16:29,353
You don't want me
demonstrating condoms.

413
00:16:29,438 --> 00:16:31,156
I mostly have sex
with women. Mm.

414
00:16:31,688 --> 00:16:33,506
Uh, and I don't want to.

415
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:34,853
Why did you even go
to medical school

416
00:16:34,938 --> 00:16:36,856
- if you don't want to help people?
- Do want to help people.

417
00:16:36,941 --> 00:16:38,767
When they're under anesthesia
and can't ask me questions.

418
00:16:38,852 --> 00:16:40,670
- Are you a Capricorn?
- That's not a real thing.

419
00:16:40,987 --> 00:16:43,956
Okay, no,
that... is for the condoms.

420
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,098
Who wants to know
where the clitoris is?

421
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:02,382
The vaginal opening
is right around here.

422
00:17:02,514 --> 00:17:04,867
And then you go up, up, up,

423
00:17:04,952 --> 00:17:08,537
and this point at the very top
is the clitoris.

424
00:17:08,622 --> 00:17:11,308
Now, it's a bundle of
extremely sensitive nerves.

425
00:17:11,393 --> 00:17:14,980
So, if you touch it too hard,
you will cause pain.

426
00:17:15,065 --> 00:17:18,617
You want to approach gently
with a flat hand.

427
00:17:18,702 --> 00:17:20,921
Gently, no poking.

428
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:21,841
It's not a button.

429
00:17:21,926 --> 00:17:23,982
Yeah, and for those of you
with vaginas,

430
00:17:24,067 --> 00:17:27,186
getting to know this part
of your body on your own

431
00:17:27,271 --> 00:17:29,521
is the easiest way
to avoid getting pregnant.

432
00:17:29,704 --> 00:17:31,692
Have you ever tried to...

433
00:17:31,777 --> 00:17:33,095
really hold on,

434
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,630
like you're riding
on a roller coaster,

435
00:17:34,745 --> 00:17:37,661
and you're not allowed to scream
until you get off the ride?

436
00:17:37,746 --> 00:17:39,403
That is the pull-out method.

437
00:17:39,488 --> 00:17:40,906
It is truly an excellent way

438
00:17:40,991 --> 00:17:42,263
to accidentally
get someone pregnant.

439
00:17:42,348 --> 00:17:44,091
Dr. Millin?
Thank you, Doctor.

440
00:17:44,176 --> 00:17:45,458
<i>♪ It's amazing, we made it</i>

441
00:17:45,543 --> 00:17:46,950
- Dr. Kwan?
- Thank you, Doctor.

442
00:17:47,035 --> 00:17:49,553
Now, hold it at the tip
of an erect penis.

443
00:17:49,638 --> 00:17:51,556
That part's
very important.

444
00:17:51,641 --> 00:17:53,727
And then
you roll it down...

445
00:17:57,417 --> 00:17:59,060
You out of practice?

446
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:01,597
Never had to put a condom on
anything as small as a banana.

447
00:18:01,682 --> 00:18:03,567
You get a condom,
you get a condom,

448
00:18:04,385 --> 00:18:06,169
you get a condom,
you get a condom!

449

I hated high school.
I-I can't go back. I can't.

458

This isn't about sex ed.

She's waiting on
a pregnancy test.

462
00:18:31,734 --> 00:18:33,761
I have got to run into
an emergent ovarian torsion.

463
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:36,080
Can you keep an eye out for
the results and deliver them?

464
00:18:36,165 --> 00:18:36,831
Of course.

465
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,878
And, Schmitt,
she's scared.

466

Oh, I can relate to a scared
high schooler.

467
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:43,795
One of our students collapsed.
She has an ovarian torsion.

468
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,604
I want to get her in the O.R.
right away.

469
00:18:45,689 --> 00:18:46,854

No, she's not doing them,
she's killing them, one after the next.

515
00:20:36,962 --> 00:20:38,813
I have never seen anything
like it. Watch.

516
00:20:40,153 --> 00:20:41,384
Did she just...?
Yeah.

517
00:20:41,469 --> 00:20:44,056
I couldn't even understand
the instructions that fast.

518
00:20:44,141 --> 00:20:46,533
Look at her. She's so
relaxed, like it's nothing. Yeah.

519
00:20:46,618 --> 00:20:47,783
I mean, what do we do with this?
What is this?

520
00:20:47,874 --> 00:20:48,876
"Guinness Book
of World Records"?

521
00:20:48,961 --> 00:20:50,720
You skip high school,
go straight to college?

522
00:20:50,805 --> 00:20:51,697
What am
I looking at here?

523
00:20:51,782 --> 00:20:54,101
Feel like I'm watching
the U.S. Open.

524
00:20:54,856 --> 00:20:57,134
Uh, hey, could I steal you
for a half-hour?

525
00:20:57,219 --> 00:20:58,204
It's for a sex-ed thing.

526
00:20:58,289 --> 00:20:59,974
Uh, yeah,
we talked about this.

527
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,176
I'm your superior.
I...

528
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:02,812
No, it's for
a literal sex-ed thing.

529
00:21:02,897 --> 00:21:05,349
I need help with
a literal sex video, Link.

530
00:21:05,434 --> 00:21:07,719
Wow.
Still very not-okay.

531
00:21:07,804 --> 00:21:09,884
And, you know, I'd prefer
if you call me Dr. Lincoln.

532
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:11,119
Everyone calls you Link.

533
00:21:11,204 --> 00:21:13,033
Everyone except you,
moving forward.

534
00:21:13,118 --> 00:21:14,704
Okay,
can you just do it?

535
00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:16,783
I mean, we are flying by
the seat of our pants up there.

536
00:21:16,868 --> 00:21:17,970
No. No, I don't want
to lose my job today.

537
00:21:18,055 --> 00:21:19,673
It's teaching.
Or harassment.

538
00:21:19,758 --> 00:21:20,728
And I don't want to
tempt fate.

539
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:22,095
Which one of us
is being harassed?

540
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,298
I don't think it matters.
Find an actual couple.

541
00:21:25,763 --> 00:21:28,270
Ah, Dr. Ndugu,
could you and Dr. Pierce

542
00:21:28,355 --> 00:21:30,162
please demonstrate
sexual consent

543
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:31,525
for a roomful
of teenagers?

544
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:33,562
I...

545
00:21:33,946 --> 00:21:35,290
No.

546
00:21:36,268 --> 00:21:40,665
Consensual sex requires no
verbal persuasion or convincing.

547
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:44,036
If you have to beg for it
or force it, it is not consent,

548
00:21:44,121 --> 00:21:46,005
and you're
doing it wrong.

549
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,642
So...

550
00:21:48,209 --> 00:21:50,189
let's learn
how to do it right.

551
00:21:50,274 --> 00:21:53,548
There are 11 erogenous zones
on the female body...

552
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,681
The ear, the neck,
the armpit...

553
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:57,212
Wait, what,
the armpits?

554
00:21:57,297 --> 00:21:58,697
Yes.
You wouldn't know that,

555
00:21:58,782 --> 00:22:00,533
because like most men,
you go straight for the...

556
00:22:02,805 --> 00:22:04,783
But the nipples
on many women

557
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,008
can be as sensitive
as the clitoris,

558
00:22:07,093 --> 00:22:08,644
so going
straight for them

559
00:22:08,729 --> 00:22:10,179
without any foreplay
to the erogenous zones,

560
00:22:10,264 --> 00:22:12,449
can be painful
and overstimulating.

561
00:22:12,534 --> 00:22:15,621
The other erogenous zones
can be the stomach,

562
00:22:15,706 --> 00:22:18,775
the inner thighs, the feet,
the back of the knees...

563
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:22,412
Have you ever had someone lick
the back of your knees before?

564
00:22:22,497 --> 00:22:24,482
Wouldn't you like
to know?

565
00:22:24,778 --> 00:22:26,029
...the more obvious
erogenous zones.

566
00:22:26,113 --> 00:22:28,540
The external
vaginal region...

567
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,236
Wilson,
tell me what you see.

568
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:33,767
You are draining the cyst to get
access to the torsed ovary.

569
00:22:33,951 --> 00:22:36,626
And I've created a barrier to
prevent spillage

570
00:22:36,711 --> 00:22:38,760
from the cyst's contents
into the abdomen,

571
00:22:38,845 --> 00:22:40,111
in case of malignancy.

572
00:22:40,196 --> 00:22:42,556
Torsion's a rare complication
of cysts,

573
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:44,423
and I used to caution
my patients

574
00:22:44,522 --> 00:22:46,440
from imagining
the worst-case scenario,

575
00:22:46,525 --> 00:22:48,543
but now, after the stripping
of Roe v. Wade,

576
00:22:48,688 --> 00:22:50,978
everything feels like
the worst-case scenario.

577
00:22:51,063 --> 00:22:52,180
Amen to that.

578
00:22:52,313 --> 00:22:54,264
I have
constant rage inside.

579
00:22:54,349 --> 00:22:56,067
Yeah, I've thought about going
to one of those places

580
00:22:56,152 --> 00:22:58,142
where you pay money
to destroy things.

581
00:22:58,227 --> 00:22:59,494
Doesn't help.

582
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:00,896
I also have rage.

583
00:23:00,981 --> 00:23:02,866
I moved to O.B. for joy.

584
00:23:02,951 --> 00:23:05,587
I wanted joy, and now I'm gonna
watch teenage girls die

585
00:23:05,672 --> 00:23:08,150
from sticking coat hangers
up inside of themselves.

586
00:23:08,235 --> 00:23:10,290
I mean, what if it's like
the '70s all over again,

587
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,853
and there
are septic wards?

588
00:23:11,938 --> 00:23:13,589
Someone should
make a video

589
00:23:13,674 --> 00:23:15,423
about how dangerous
a coat hanger is.

590
00:23:15,508 --> 00:23:17,244
That's an excellent idea.

591
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:19,181
There's bleeding here.
I don't know where it's coming from.

592
00:23:19,266 --> 00:23:20,383
Lap pad.

593
00:23:24,871 --> 00:23:26,212
Let's extend
the incision.

594
00:23:26,297 --> 00:23:28,982
That exponentially increases
her risk for complications.

595
00:23:29,067 --> 00:23:31,619
She's 17 years old.
What if she wants to have a baby someday?

596
00:23:31,704 --> 00:23:33,900
If the other ovary is torsed
and it doesn't re-perfuse,

597
00:23:33,985 --> 00:23:35,173
this may be all she has.

598
00:23:35,258 --> 00:23:36,087
So, come on, let's go.

599
00:23:36,172 --> 00:23:37,126
- Okay.
- Now.

600
00:23:42,218 --> 00:23:44,303
Lucia?
I'm Dr. Schmitt.

601
00:23:44,388 --> 00:23:47,107
Dr. Montgomery
is in surgery.

602
00:23:47,362 --> 00:23:48,946
Do you have my results?

603
00:23:49,754 --> 00:23:52,356
It's positive.
You're pregnant.

604
00:23:52,545 --> 00:23:55,347
We did it one time.

605
00:23:57,309 --> 00:24:01,062
Did you not think that you could
get pregnant the first time?

606
00:24:01,676 --> 00:24:03,012
I-I'm not stupid.

607
00:24:03,097 --> 00:24:06,731
I just didn't think I would
get pregnant the first time.

608
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,520
Do you think that you might want
to keep the pregnancy?

609
00:24:09,612 --> 00:24:11,730
No! I'm sorry.
I-I have to ask.

610
00:24:11,815 --> 00:24:12,832
I can't have a baby.

611
00:24:12,917 --> 00:24:14,411
I'm a stupid
high schooler

612
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:16,332
who hasn't fed her fish
since Tuesday.

613
00:24:16,417 --> 00:24:18,169
All I have to do
is put in a pinch of flakes,

614
00:24:18,254 --> 00:24:19,465
and I still
haven't done it.

615
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,934
A kid needs food every day...
Real food.

616
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:24,356
I would be the mother
who forgets to feed her baby,

617
00:24:24,441 --> 00:24:26,340
and I would get arrested
or something.

618
00:24:26,425 --> 00:24:28,989
Oh, my God, I don't want
to be pregnant senior year.

619
00:24:29,074 --> 00:24:30,526
Do you know how mean
kids are?

620
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,067
I do.

621
00:24:32,219 --> 00:24:34,746
I think my parents
might actually murder me.

622
00:24:34,831 --> 00:24:36,629
Hey.

623
00:24:36,714 --> 00:24:39,633
They don't have to know
if you don't want them to.

624
00:24:39,809 --> 00:24:42,270
As long as the embryo measures
under 10 weeks,

625
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:44,374
you can have
a medical abortion.

626
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,168
We'll give you pills so that
you can manage it at home.

627
00:24:47,253 --> 00:24:50,022
They say it's like a...
Like a really bad period.

628
00:24:51,552 --> 00:24:53,567
Yes, please,
get me the pills.

629
00:24:53,652 --> 00:24:55,470
Can we please
just get this over with?

630
00:24:55,676 --> 00:24:56,877
I'll get the ultrasound.

631
00:25:09,427 --> 00:25:13,762
She's calmed down now.
She's with Adams.

632
00:25:13,933 --> 00:25:15,309
Thank you.

633
00:25:15,394 --> 00:25:16,567
How long?

634
00:25:16,652 --> 00:25:18,590
Uh, two years.

635
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:22,637
Gotten a lot worse
the last six months.

636
00:25:23,887 --> 00:25:25,926
My mother
had Alzheimer's.

637
00:25:26,011 --> 00:25:28,029
When I was an intern,
she got brought in here

638
00:25:28,114 --> 00:25:29,365
with diverticulitis.

639
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:30,600
She kept
running out of her room

640
00:25:30,685 --> 00:25:32,788
thinking she was late
for surgery.

641
00:25:37,855 --> 00:25:39,873
My grandma keeps thinking
I'm my mom.

642
00:25:40,603 --> 00:25:42,543
You must look
a lot like her.

643
00:25:42,777 --> 00:25:44,661
Look alike
in some photos.

644
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:48,943
She died when I...
was born.

645
00:25:49,511 --> 00:25:50,911
I'm sorry.

646
00:25:53,145 --> 00:25:54,863
Now you have to keep
telling your grandmother

647
00:25:54,948 --> 00:25:57,739
- over and over that her...
- Ooh, I... I can't do this.

648
00:25:57,824 --> 00:25:59,879
I can't watch this.
I, um...

649
00:26:01,461 --> 00:26:04,715
I-I put every effort I could
into matching across the country

650
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,114
so I wouldn't
have to watch this,

651
00:26:06,199 --> 00:26:07,957
and that went to hell,
and now I'm here.

652
00:26:08,042 --> 00:26:10,184
I'm stuck in that house,
and...

653
00:26:10,804 --> 00:26:13,356
I love her.
She's my grandmother.

654
00:26:13,527 --> 00:26:16,645
She raised me.
She's why I made it this far.

655
00:26:18,358 --> 00:26:22,325
It might be helpful if you don't
tell her that her daughter died.

656
00:26:22,462 --> 00:26:24,896
I know it's not easy,
but living in her reality

657
00:26:24,981 --> 00:26:26,965
is the most humane option.

658
00:26:27,551 --> 00:26:30,231
I don't think
I have it in me.

659
00:26:30,316 --> 00:26:33,121
Nobody does.
You'll find it.

660
00:26:36,035 --> 00:26:39,793
Is it okay if I stay out here
a little longer? I just...

661
00:26:39,878 --> 00:26:41,082
Of course.

662
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:42,801
I really feel your pain,
Griffith.

663
00:26:43,194 --> 00:26:44,844
My door is always open.

664
00:26:57,996 --> 00:27:00,120
What's going on?
Is Zola okay?

665
00:27:00,205 --> 00:27:02,169
Oh, yeah, she's okay.
She's in there with Amelia.

666
00:27:02,457 --> 00:27:05,295
Okay. I thought she may have
had another panic attack. No, no.

667
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:08,020
But she did find
some of Kai's puzzles

668
00:27:08,105 --> 00:27:10,190
that they use for
neurological evaluations.

669
00:27:10,275 --> 00:27:12,738
The puzzles mainly focus
on visual-spatial skills.

670
00:27:12,823 --> 00:27:15,576
Yeah, I'm familiar with them.
What... What's going on?

671
00:27:15,835 --> 00:27:17,753
Meredith, she's aced every single one

672
00:27:17,838 --> 00:27:19,856
at a level far higher
than most of the adults I see.

673
00:27:19,941 --> 00:27:21,192
I'm aware
that she's smart.

674
00:27:21,277 --> 00:27:24,613
My question is, why is she being
evaluated without my consent?

675
00:27:24,856 --> 00:27:26,996
Right, well, it...
Yeah, it was an accident.

676
00:27:27,081 --> 00:27:29,052
Zola discovered the test
when she and I

677
00:27:29,137 --> 00:27:30,910
were in there practicing
on the simulators.

678
00:27:30,995 --> 00:27:32,880
She's supposed to be
in my office doing homework.

679
00:27:32,965 --> 00:27:34,892
Mer, based on Kai's time
with her,

680
00:27:34,976 --> 00:27:37,662
Zola is
extremely gifted,

681
00:27:37,746 --> 00:27:39,229
which could explain
the panic attacks.

682
00:27:39,313 --> 00:27:41,065
When giftedness
is undiagnosed,

683
00:27:41,149 --> 00:27:43,067
it can contribute
to behavioral issues...

684
00:27:43,151 --> 00:27:45,703
Anxiety, a feeling
of being untethered,

685
00:27:45,787 --> 00:27:47,387
a feeling
that you don't belong.

686
00:27:47,472 --> 00:27:50,309
Because you don't. Her brain does
not function like other kids her age.

687
00:27:50,757 --> 00:27:52,376
She needs challenges
that they don't.

688
00:27:52,461 --> 00:27:54,745
She needs to be around peers
who can relate to her

689
00:27:54,829 --> 00:27:56,113
and the way she thinks.

690
00:27:57,717 --> 00:27:58,910
I'm gonna go see my kid.

691
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:07,090
Penetration is not necessary
for mutual pleasure.

692
00:28:07,332 --> 00:28:09,885
For starters, most women,
or people with vaginas,

693
00:28:09,978 --> 00:28:12,814
can't achieve orgasm
through penetration.

694
00:28:14,017 --> 00:28:15,735
Yes? How come
that's not in porn?

695
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:19,172
Because porn is to actual
human sex

696
00:28:19,257 --> 00:28:22,377
as the "Fast & Furious"
is to actual human driving.

697
00:28:22,462 --> 00:28:24,824
That is to say,
it bears no resemblance.

698
00:28:24,909 --> 00:28:26,668
If you are having sex
with your partner,

699
00:28:26,753 --> 00:28:28,699
and you are trying
to make it look like porn,

700
00:28:28,784 --> 00:28:32,170
your partner is experiencing
little to no pleasure.

701
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,793
I would disagree.

702
00:28:33,895 --> 00:28:36,220
Well, you would disagree because
the girls you are with

703
00:28:36,304 --> 00:28:38,255
are also making it look
and sound like porn.

704
00:28:38,339 --> 00:28:39,887
But that is just an act.

705
00:28:39,972 --> 00:28:42,725
A real man wants to give a woman
a real orgasm.

706
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:45,395
So you want to be a real man
or some candy-ass actor

707
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,164
for whom a woman has
to pretend to enjoy sex?

708
00:28:49,202 --> 00:28:50,753
Guess they were right.

709
00:28:50,838 --> 00:28:52,887
This is
definitely going viral.

710
00:28:52,972 --> 00:28:55,191
Oh, not yet.
Need music.

711
00:28:55,276 --> 00:28:56,344

712
00:28:58,893 --> 00:29:00,911
Hot dog!

713
00:29:00,995 --> 00:29:03,147
Mrs.
Ward, you're killing me.

714
00:29:03,231 --> 00:29:05,650
Well, I guess you're lucky
that you're handsome, huh?

715
00:29:05,734 --> 00:29:07,957
Where are you from?

716
00:29:08,042 --> 00:29:10,661
Uh, Connecticut,
but my dad's from Barbados.

717
00:29:10,746 --> 00:29:11,963
Ah.

718
00:29:12,048 --> 00:29:13,048

but we were able
to salvage them,

739
00:30:03,528 --> 00:30:06,302

00:30:09,497 --> 00:30:11,583

bad menstrual cramps

743
00:30:11,668 --> 00:30:12,982
and that it runs

744
00:30:13,067 --> 00:30:14,513
I gave her
a hot water bottle.

745
00:30:14,598 --> 00:30:16,350
I never even took her
to see the gynecologist.

746

Oh, this isn't your fault.

747
00:30:17,848 --> 00:30:20,311
No, unless someone specifically
educates you

748
00:30:20,396 --> 00:30:23,419
on what to look for,
it's hard to know what's normal

749
00:30:23,504 --> 00:30:26,222
and what's an indication
of an underlying problem.

750
00:30:26,343 --> 00:30:28,724

00:30:47,335 --> 00:30:50,276
First, you'll take mifepristone.
It's just one pill.

758
00:30:50,361 --> 00:30:51,912
It'll stop the pregnancy
from growing.

759
00:30:52,073 --> 00:30:55,425
Then, after 24 hours,
you'll take misoprostol.

760
00:30:55,509 --> 00:30:56,409
It's four pills.

761
00:30:56,494 --> 00:30:59,530
Put all four pills under
your tongue for 30 minutes.

762
00:30:59,614 --> 00:31:00,752
And then after 30 minutes,

763
00:31:00,837 --> 00:31:02,831
swallow whatever is left
of the pills with water.

764
00:31:02,973 --> 00:31:05,191
And then a few hours
after you take the misoprostol,

765
00:31:05,276 --> 00:31:07,705
you'll experience
some cramping and bleeding,

766
00:31:07,789 --> 00:31:09,151
like a very heavy period.

767
00:31:09,236 --> 00:31:11,667
Then you'll pass the pregnancy,
and the pain will stop.

768
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,278
How do I know
if something's wrong?

769
00:31:13,363 --> 00:31:15,565
It's extremely rare
to have complications

770
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:18,402
with a medical abortion,
but if something feels off...

771
00:31:18,512 --> 00:31:21,565
Fever, no bleeding,
too much bleeding...

772
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:23,110
Then I want you

This is

807
00:33:04,734 --> 00:33:08,662
I would like to reopen

808

809
00:33:11,083 --> 00:33:12,758
I-I would run it
20 hours a week,

810
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:16,737
and the rest of the time,
I will be an attending,

811
00:33:16,821 --> 00:33:18,606

Ah, she's incredible.

Doesn't remember
her address,

828

but still seems to be
an ace at cards.

829
00:34:09,641 --> 00:34:11,461
Yeah, it's always

830
00:34:11,688 --> 00:34:13,940
Growing up, all the kids
played Scrabble and Monopoly.

831
00:34:14,212 --> 00:34:16,531

00:34:22,134 --> 00:34:23,384
Yeah, fine.

right?
