1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,400
Previously on "ER".

2
00:00:06,433 --> 00:00:07,600
You should know
you're being considered

3
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:09,333
for chief resident next year.

4
00:00:09,366 --> 00:00:10,700
I'm pregnant.

5
00:00:10,733 --> 00:00:13,266
‐ Roger's out of town.
‐ Is he ever around?

6
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,166
We haven't been gettin'
along too well, lately.

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,466
What do you want, Kerry?

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,300
I thought you might be hungry.

9
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:22,233
No, no, I'm not, and I have
a ton of work to do so..

10
00:00:22,266 --> 00:00:23,800
Your mother has just
been transported

11
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:26,333
to her commitment hearing.
Aren't you supposed to testify?

12
00:00:26,366 --> 00:00:28,633
Mrs. Wyczenski's released
on her own recognizance.

13
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:30,133
She needs hospitalization.

14
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:31,366
I'm not debating it
with you, miss.

15
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,700
Why do you think I'm here?

16
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:34,666
'Cause you know
she needs your help

17
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,466
even if she doesn't want it.

18
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,300
I just hope you didn't order
from that Thai place again.

19
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,000
Very good.

20
00:00:48,066 --> 00:00:49,433
My turn now?

21
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,266
Hey, he finished
his breakfast?

22
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,066
No, but I got him
to eat some strawberries.

23
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,033
Ah, Cleo, he's supposed
to have hot cereal

24
00:00:55,066 --> 00:00:56,733
before he gets treats.

25
00:00:56,766 --> 00:00:59,733
These are just as nutritious
if not more so.

26
00:00:59,766 --> 00:01:01,700
And they're yummy, too.

27
00:01:01,733 --> 00:01:03,166
'At least tell
the baby‐sitter'

28
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,600
'to make sure
he has a good lunch.'

29
00:01:04,633 --> 00:01:06,433
I cancelled the sitter.

30
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:09,533
‐ What?
‐ I'm off today.

31
00:01:09,566 --> 00:01:12,300
Cleo, Reese needs
a lot of attention.

32
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:13,666
Peter, I'm a pediatrician.

33
00:01:15,633 --> 00:01:17,433
Alright.

34
00:01:17,466 --> 00:01:20,300
Hey, see you, man.

35
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:24,166
Say, see you
at the game, daddy.

36
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,366
What are you talking about?

37
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,300
I didn't say I was gonna
play tonight.

38
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:30,133
You're not. You're going to sit
in the bleachers with Reese.

39
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:32,300
'Come on, it'll be fun.
I'm playing first base.'

40
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:34,100
Hey, he doesn't
have a jacket here.

41
00:01:34,133 --> 00:01:35,633
I'll go to Carla's
and pick one up.

42
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:38,100
'No, you know what,
I'll do it.'

43
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:41,566
‐ I can go.
‐ I said I'll go, okay?

44
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,700
‐ I'm on the cell.
‐ Okay.

45
00:01:43,733 --> 00:01:45,266
Wanna play trains?

46
00:01:49,233 --> 00:01:52,466
God, I slept so great,
and dreams..

47
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,066
...so wonderful
to be able to dream again.

48
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,400
Obviously, the therapy sessions
are helping and these walks.

49
00:01:59,433 --> 00:02:01,433
Good.

50
00:02:01,466 --> 00:02:04,300
You know what you don't
have to stay home all the time.

51
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,200
I'm sure Luka
would love to see you.

52
00:02:06,233 --> 00:02:07,366
It's only been
a couple of weeks.

53
00:02:09,066 --> 00:02:10,433
‐ He's a good man.
‐ Yeah.

54
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:14,233
‐ So's your friend John.
‐ Yeah.

55
00:02:14,266 --> 00:02:16,100
Must be fun to have
two men interested in you‐‐

56
00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:17,400
Ah, ah, mom.

57
00:02:17,433 --> 00:02:19,600
I've had men interested
in me all my life

58
00:02:19,633 --> 00:02:23,100
you know,
just not good ones.

59
00:02:23,133 --> 00:02:25,033
Actually, I think
your father was the best

60
00:02:25,066 --> 00:02:26,233
compared to all the rest.

61
00:02:26,266 --> 00:02:28,100
But, certainly blew that.

62
00:02:28,133 --> 00:02:29,533
Think we should head home?

63
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,266
Why is it we can't talk?

64
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,433
We're talking.

65
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,366
No, I mean about
important things.

66
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,233
You‐you know, Dr. Legaspi
says it‐it might be

67
00:02:42,266 --> 00:02:44,666
easier for us to do it
in a therapy session.

68
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,400
‐ Do what?
‐ Talk.

69
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:48,800
She wants you to come
to one of the sessions.

70
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,200
No.

71
00:02:50,233 --> 00:02:52,033
I want you to
come too, please?

72
00:02:52,066 --> 00:02:53,266
You could come
during lunch break.

73
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,533
I'm gonna head back.

74
00:02:54,566 --> 00:02:55,800
Abby, will you come?

75
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:58,100
I'm gonna go to work.

76
00:02:58,133 --> 00:03:00,166
Come on, just, just
think about it, alright?

77
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,800
Hi.

78
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,266
Hi.

79
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,400
Can I help you?

80
00:03:17,133 --> 00:03:20,066
Uh, I was just
dropping something off.

81
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,600
For Kim?
She's in the shower.

82
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,533
I can give her that
if you want.

83
00:03:27,266 --> 00:03:28,433
No, thanks.

84
00:03:28,466 --> 00:03:30,533
Uh, I'll pass it on later.

85
00:03:30,566 --> 00:03:32,200
Well, you're welcome
to come in and wait‐‐

86
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:34,500
No, th‐thats, uh, won't
be necessary, thank you.

87
00:03:34,533 --> 00:03:36,500
Well, if you give me your name
I could tell her you stopped by.

88
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:31,066
‐ Dr. Greene?
‐ Uh, huh?

89
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,266
‐ Yeah, uh, sorry.
‐ Ugh.

90
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,500
I need to, uh,
get some lab slips.

91
00:04:33,533 --> 00:04:36,100
Oh, sure, sure.

92
00:04:36,133 --> 00:04:38,233
‐ Baby keeping you up, huh?
‐ Oh, not really.

93
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:41,400
She slept for six hours last
night ten minutes at a time.

94
00:04:43,066 --> 00:04:44,533
How long we gotta wait here?

95
00:04:44,566 --> 00:04:45,666
Been in the hall for
five minutes

96
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,766
can't find a doc
to save my life.

97
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,066
'What do you got?'

98
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,266
Seven year old boy
tried to

99
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,466
put out a fire
in a garbage can.

100
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,800
Partial thickness burns
over both hands.

101
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,300
‐ Need some help?
‐ Sure.

102
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:54,500
‐ BP 110/60.
‐ 'Get it out!'

103
00:04:54,533 --> 00:04:56,033
Is that him?
He sounds agitated.

104
00:04:56,066 --> 00:04:57,633
You could say that.

105
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,700
Hey, I'm Dr. Mark Greene.
You want to tell me your name?

106
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,566
‐ No!
‐ It's Ben.

107
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,800
‐ I want this out of my nose.
‐ That's to help you breathe.

108
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,533
It's only for
a little while, okay?

109
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:07,266
‐ Are you his mother?
‐ Next door neighbor.

110
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,700
‐ He's a friend of my son's.
‐ 'No one's at the kid's house?'

111
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:11,533
Good air entry.
Both lungs are clear.

112
00:05:11,566 --> 00:05:13,133
Any way to contact
the parents?

113
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,700
He just has a father,
I left him a message.

114
00:05:14,733 --> 00:05:15,800
I wanna go home.

115
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,266
‐ Let's go.
‐ Get it out!

116
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,333
Randi, what do you
see me in a Beemer

117
00:05:19,366 --> 00:05:20,433
or a Porsche?

118
00:05:20,466 --> 00:05:21,733
Most of the time
I see you walking.

119
00:05:21,766 --> 00:05:24,466
Okay, you can
forget about a ride.

120
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,333
Carter? Buy or lease?

121
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:29,266
Dr. Dave, behind
the wheel, huh?

122
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,200
This is topaz
blue metallic.

123
00:05:31,233 --> 00:05:32,400
What do you think?

124
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:33,800
I think it's out
of your price range.

125
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,100
Moon lighting at a doc
in the box, my friend.

126
00:05:36,133 --> 00:05:37,733
There you go, three months,
I got my down payment.

127
00:05:37,766 --> 00:05:38,766
Ooh, and then what happens?

128
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,566
Yeah, fake my own death.

129
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,266
Hey, uh, you playing
ball tonight?

130
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,300
We're gonna kick
sanitation's ass.

131
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:44,533
Maybe.

132
00:05:44,566 --> 00:05:46,300
Neck pain in curtain one
is asking for you.

133
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,233
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Black or sand interior?

134
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:50,033
Dr. Malucci, I hope
you're not keeping

135
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:51,666
patients waiting while
you shop for a car.

136
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,266
No, no, no, I'm all over
that board, chief.

137
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,566
Don't worry, he still has to
pass his driver's license test.

138
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,166
Dr. Carter, can I speak
to you a minute?

139
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,400
Sure.

140
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,533
‐ 'Morning.'
‐ Morning, Dr. Chen.

141
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:07,333
‐ Hey.
‐ Deb.

142
00:06:09,066 --> 00:06:12,466
‐ Could you excuse us a minute?
‐ Oh, sure.

143
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,133
Your application was
intercepted by administration.

144
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:23,066
The processing time
has improved.

145
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,600
Ah, you realize you're still
on a probationary period?

146
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,533
Which will be completed
by the time

147
00:06:28,566 --> 00:06:30,733
the chief resident slot
needs to be filled.

148
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:32,600
Why do you wanna
do this?

149
00:06:32,633 --> 00:06:35,033
Well, it gets me closer
to a junior faculty position.

150
00:06:35,766 --> 00:06:37,366
Looks good on the CV.

151
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,666
No, I mean why risk
compromising your recovery

152
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,266
by taking on a new
and very demanding position?

153
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,333
I guess I don't
see it as a risk.

154
00:06:46,366 --> 00:06:49,300
Having teaching and
administrative responsibilities

155
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,666
along with your
clinical shifts?

156
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,700
I'm in the program.
I've been managing my stress.

157
00:06:52,733 --> 00:06:55,700
I got myself...back up
to speed.

158
00:06:55,733 --> 00:06:58,600
Carter, you'd all but give up
nights and weekends.

159
00:06:58,633 --> 00:07:01,366
It's a tremendous
amount of work.

160
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,400
I'm ready for it.

161
00:07:03,433 --> 00:07:05,700
You can't just gloss over
what happened last year.

162
00:07:05,733 --> 00:07:07,200
Neither can the committee.

163
00:07:07,233 --> 00:07:09,233
You're returning
my application?

164
00:07:09,266 --> 00:07:11,733
Did you honestly think that
you'd make the first cut?

165
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:16,700
‐ Get your hands off me!
‐ He's all yours.

166
00:07:16,733 --> 00:07:18,200
Yeah, let me take
a closer look.

167
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:19,566
Don't touch me!

168
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,333
It'll feel better
in a second, I promise.

169
00:07:21,366 --> 00:07:23,666
‐ Mild erythema, no blistering.
‐ It hurts. Stop!

170
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,566
You have to let
the doctor finish, okay?

171
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,600
You wanna tell
me what happened?

172
00:07:26,633 --> 00:07:28,166
No.

173
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,266
I think, he may have
lit the fire himself.

174
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,666
Shut up!

175
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,700
'Why don't we get
a burn tray for Ben here?'

176
00:07:31,733 --> 00:07:33,366
Sure.

177
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,566
‐ He's home by himself a lot.
‐ I said, shut up!

178
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,066
Just wish he would stop
hangin' around my son.

179
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,233
Hey, good news.

180
00:07:41,266 --> 00:07:43,233
Our second baseman
has a stomach flu.

181
00:07:43,266 --> 00:07:45,200
Luka, I'm not
playing softball.

182
00:07:45,233 --> 00:07:47,100
But, you don't have to be
great, it's just for fun.

183
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,266
Actually, I happen
to play very well.

184
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,766
‐ So go, it'd be good for you.
‐ I can't.

185
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,366
One night away from your mother
isn't gonna do anything.

186
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,433
I miss you.

187
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,500
Have a good time tonight.

188
00:08:07,366 --> 00:08:09,700
Connie, can you dispense some
ketoconazole to exam one?

189
00:08:09,733 --> 00:08:11,100
‐ Sure.
‐ Thanks.

190
00:08:11,133 --> 00:08:12,566
Emergency ringworm, huh?

191
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,066
Yeah, pretty hard
to avoid, the guy has 40 cats.

192
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,233
You might want to give him a
flea bath while you're at it.

193
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:21,400
So what's going on
between you and Weaver?

194
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,566
Not much.

195
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,433
Except for her denying my
application for chief resident.

196
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,266
Apparently, I still have
a scarlet A on my chest.

197
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,433
Oh, wow, I'm
really sorry, John.

198
00:08:35,066 --> 00:08:37,300
Don't be.
Makes you a shoo‐in.

199
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,766
‐ There are other candidates.
‐ Not really.

200
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,500
I guess congratulations
are in order.

201
00:08:42,533 --> 00:08:44,333
Congratulations,
you deserve it.

202
00:08:44,366 --> 00:08:45,800
‐ Thanks.
‐ Not as much as me, but..

203
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,166
Yeah, right.

204
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,700
‐ Hey.
‐ It's on the chair.

205
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,500
‐ I put a cap in there, too.
‐ Alright, good.

206
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,333
Just stay a while
and have some coffee maybe?

207
00:08:59,366 --> 00:09:01,666
Uh, you know what,
I need to get back.

208
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:06,133
You alright?

209
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,300
Yeah.

210
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,600
Hmm, Roger..

211
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,000
...moved out a few days ago.

212
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,533
'I'll be okay.'

213
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,400
You sure?

214
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,366
It would've saved us both
a whole lot of trouble

215
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,500
if we had just stayed
together, you know, Peter?

216
00:09:35,566 --> 00:09:39,433
Would've been better
for Reese, anyway.

217
00:09:44,733 --> 00:09:46,333
He said he never
loved me.

218
00:09:49,766 --> 00:09:51,366
You know, Carla,
people say a lot of things

219
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,233
they don't mean
when they're fighting.

220
00:09:53,266 --> 00:09:54,700
I don't know.

221
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:59,200
I think, uh, it's true.

222
00:09:59,233 --> 00:10:01,600
Maybe we never had anything.

223
00:10:05,266 --> 00:10:06,566
It'll work itself out.

224
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,100
You and I..

225
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,733
We had somethin'.

226
00:10:20,633 --> 00:10:22,600
Didn't we, Peter, hmm?

227
00:10:23,433 --> 00:10:24,566
Hmm?

228
00:10:29,633 --> 00:10:32,233
Sometimes I think
we still do.

229
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:33,400
I'm not doing this, Carla.

230
00:10:34,566 --> 00:10:35,733
'Peter don't go.'

231
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,100
‐ Yeah?
‐ 'That's a nice hello .'

232
00:10:42,133 --> 00:10:43,300
Cleo.

233
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,666
Did you make it to Carla's yet?

234
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,433
‐ 'A few minutes ago.'
‐ 'Good.'

235
00:10:46,466 --> 00:10:48,700
'Hey, how about picking up
Deli on the way home?'

236
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:50,200
'We can have a picnic
on the field.'

237
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,366
Uh, sure, yeah, whatever.

238
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,766
‐ You alright?
‐'Yeah, why?'

239
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,600
'I don't know,
you sound funny.'

240
00:10:56,633 --> 00:10:59,033
‐ 'She giving you a hard time?'
‐ Who?

241
00:10:59,066 --> 00:11:01,133
‐ Carla.
‐ 'You know, I'm sorry.'

242
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,633
'I'm‐I'm just in a rush.'

243
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,400
Oh. Reese, wait!

244
00:11:04,433 --> 00:11:05,600
‐ 'What's he doing?'
‐ Hang on, Peter.

245
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,466
Oh, my God!

246
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,666
Cleo, what happened?

247
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,466
Is there somethin' wrong?

248
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,533
Read it and weep.

249
00:11:13,566 --> 00:11:16,133
No bleeding, no hydrocephalus,
no midline shift

250
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,500
no subarachnoid hemorrhage.

251
00:11:18,766 --> 00:11:20,300
Okay, do an LP.

252
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,133
Hey, crying
neck pain patient.

253
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,800
Well, you want me to give
a Demerol junkie a spinal tap?

254
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:27,066
CT's are only
95% sensitive, Dave.

255
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,300
Ooh, what are you two,
a tag team?

256
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,233
I know what I'm doing.

257
00:11:31,266 --> 00:11:33,300
Oh, to be a junior
resident again.

258
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,533
Not.

259
00:11:34,566 --> 00:11:36,000
‐ Dr. Chen, can I see you?
‐ Sure.

260
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,633
‐ Good luck.
‐ Thanks.

261
00:11:43,066 --> 00:11:46,133
As you know, chief residency
is typically an extra year

262
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,800
completing the emergency
medicine program.

263
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,033
In rare cases we
make an exception

264
00:11:51,066 --> 00:11:54,600
and allow a senior to be
promoted into the position.

265
00:11:54,633 --> 00:11:56,033
Right.

266
00:11:56,066 --> 00:11:58,033
Unfortunately,
your maternity leave

267
00:11:58,066 --> 00:12:01,733
put you three months behind
on shifts and procedures

268
00:12:01,766 --> 00:12:05,033
keeping you just shy
of senior status.

269
00:12:05,066 --> 00:12:07,466
Um, but I'm in the process
of making that up.

270
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,033
Yes, but the academic
year ends June 30th.

271
00:12:11,066 --> 00:12:13,066
And I'm planning
on working every weekend

272
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,733
'and every holiday
until then.'

273
00:12:14,766 --> 00:12:17,600
Hospital policy actively
discourages work weeks

274
00:12:17,633 --> 00:12:20,700
in excess of 60 hours
and given that limitation

275
00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:22,400
it‐it doesn't
seem feasible

276
00:12:22,433 --> 00:12:24,233
that you'd succeed
in making the deadline.

277
00:12:26,266 --> 00:12:27,766
Oh.

278
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,200
And, as a result I'm afraid
you won't be a candidate

279
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:31,566
for chief resident this year.

280
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,766
I'm sorry, I‐I know
it doesn't seem fair‐‐

281
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,666
Wait, this is completely

282
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,733
sexist and discriminatory.

283
00:12:44,766 --> 00:12:46,400
Excuse me?

284
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:47,466
You all but offered
me this position

285
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,666
prior to my pregnancy.

286
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,266
Yes, and at that time

287
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,600
I anticipated your
completion of the program.

288
00:12:52,633 --> 00:12:54,200
I had a baby.

289
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:55,466
I think I made
a choice that was

290
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,366
both legal
and responsible.

291
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,166
‐ Of course you did.
‐ I made a sacrifice.

292
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,200
Largely for the sake
of my career

293
00:13:02,233 --> 00:13:04,533
and becoming chief resident
is a huge part of that.

294
00:13:04,566 --> 00:13:06,700
‐ Jing‐Mei..
‐ I'm a good doctor.

295
00:13:06,733 --> 00:13:10,266
I've offered to make up for lost
time, and I didn't screw up.

296
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:14,100
Under the circumstances,
I think I deserve a chance.

297
00:13:14,133 --> 00:13:15,533
I appreciate your thoughts

298
00:13:15,566 --> 00:13:17,366
and I'll take them
under advisement.

299
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,233
I'd hope you would.

300
00:13:26,741 --> 00:13:29,674
‐ What is that stuff?
‐ Thermazene cream.

301
00:13:29,707 --> 00:13:30,941
It'll make you
feel better and it helps

302
00:13:30,974 --> 00:13:32,874
to keep it
from getting infected.

303
00:13:32,907 --> 00:13:35,274
‐ My fingers feel funny.
‐ How?

304
00:13:35,307 --> 00:13:37,807
‐ I can't feel the ends.
‐ No?

305
00:13:37,841 --> 00:13:40,107
‐ Maybe with this hand.
‐ Hey!

306
00:13:42,807 --> 00:13:44,674
You know,
that's not funny.

307
00:13:44,707 --> 00:13:46,641
‐ Everything okay in here?
‐ Yeah.

308
00:13:46,674 --> 00:13:48,741
Little Ben here
just tried to grab me.

309
00:13:48,774 --> 00:13:50,141
She was hurting my hand.

310
00:13:50,174 --> 00:13:51,707
Oh, yeah?
Let me take a look.

311
00:13:51,741 --> 00:13:52,974
He says he can't
feel his fingers.

312
00:13:55,974 --> 00:13:58,074
Let me see your hand.
Show them.

313
00:13:59,941 --> 00:14:01,674
‐ Ouch!
‐ Oh, it hurts there, huh?

314
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:03,907
‐ Did you fall?
‐ I don't know. Maybe.

315
00:14:03,941 --> 00:14:06,674
Let's get an X‐ray
of this left hand, just in case.

316
00:14:06,707 --> 00:14:07,941
Ouch! Ow.

317
00:14:07,974 --> 00:14:09,574
‐ Whoa, hey, hey!
‐ Hey, hey, hey!

318
00:14:09,607 --> 00:14:11,274
‐ Settle down.
‐ My head.

319
00:14:11,307 --> 00:14:13,974
Yeah, okay. Let me take
a look at your head.

320
00:14:14,007 --> 00:14:16,074
Hey, do you remember
when you hurt your ear?

321
00:14:16,107 --> 00:14:17,674
Huh?

322
00:14:17,707 --> 00:14:19,607
You gotta pretty
bad bruise back here.

323
00:14:21,907 --> 00:14:26,007
Six disc cd changer,
tinted windows that's.. Hello?

324
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,107
Here's an ACL arterial
exam two.

325
00:14:28,141 --> 00:14:30,641
‐ Yeah, I was on my way, chief.
‐ Yeah?

326
00:14:30,674 --> 00:14:33,341
Dr. Malucci, you're a resident.
You can't afford a car!

327
00:14:33,374 --> 00:14:36,074
What was all that about?

328
00:14:36,107 --> 00:14:38,941
A misguided sense
of job security.

329
00:14:38,974 --> 00:14:40,207
Lot of that
going around.

330
00:14:40,241 --> 00:14:41,941
I heard you came
by the house.

331
00:14:41,974 --> 00:14:44,674
Yeah, I was in the area and
on a whim I thought I'd stop by.

332
00:14:44,707 --> 00:14:45,974
Lori said that
you had a letter

333
00:14:46,007 --> 00:14:47,574
but that you didn't
leave it?

334
00:14:50,074 --> 00:14:52,674
Just didn't seem like
the timing was very good.

335
00:14:52,707 --> 00:14:54,074
I can see how you
would feel that way.

336
00:14:55,874 --> 00:14:58,141
How long have you two
been seeing each other?

337
00:14:58,174 --> 00:14:59,307
Not long.

338
00:15:01,341 --> 00:15:03,107
I'm sorry. I know this
must be painful for you.

339
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:04,841
No, I'm fine,
I mean, it's fine.

340
00:15:04,874 --> 00:15:06,074
Okay.

341
00:15:06,107 --> 00:15:08,941
'Kerry?'

342
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:10,841
‐ You take care of yourself.
‐ Yeah, you, too.

343
00:15:10,874 --> 00:15:13,041
Okay.

344
00:15:13,074 --> 00:15:14,607
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to interrupt.

345
00:15:14,641 --> 00:15:17,007
You didn't.

346
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,541
You two okay?

347
00:15:19,774 --> 00:15:21,107
Oh, Dr. Legaspi.

348
00:15:21,141 --> 00:15:22,241
‐ Hi.
‐ Hi.

349
00:15:22,274 --> 00:15:23,741
I was wondering
if you could tell me

350
00:15:23,774 --> 00:15:25,141
how it's going
with my mother?

351
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,607
Oh, I'm sorry, Abby.

352
00:15:26,641 --> 00:15:28,107
I really can't discuss
her therapy with you.

353
00:15:28,141 --> 00:15:29,574
Even if she said
you said

354
00:15:29,607 --> 00:15:32,107
I should attend one
of her sessions?

355
00:15:32,141 --> 00:15:35,307
I think that it would be
mutually beneficial, yeah.

356
00:15:35,341 --> 00:15:37,807
Okay.

357
00:15:37,841 --> 00:15:40,807
Could you, uh, give me a little
bit of an idea what to expect?

358
00:15:40,841 --> 00:15:43,341
Well, it's not an ambush.

359
00:15:43,374 --> 00:15:46,974
I'm sorry. It's just that,
she lies a lot.

360
00:15:48,741 --> 00:15:50,041
We meet at 1:00.

361
00:15:53,341 --> 00:15:55,174
You don't have to come
if you don't want to.

362
00:15:59,007 --> 00:16:02,641
Still hurt? I'm sorry.

363
00:16:02,674 --> 00:16:06,207
Oh, baby, look at you!

364
00:16:08,274 --> 00:16:11,707
Oh, it's alright.
Mommy's here.

365
00:16:11,741 --> 00:16:12,974
How bad is it?

366
00:16:13,007 --> 00:16:15,241
He's got a fracture
of the fifth metacarpal.

367
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:16,974
His hand is broken?

368
00:16:17,007 --> 00:16:18,841
He's going to have to wear
a cast six to eight weeks.

369
00:16:18,874 --> 00:16:20,707
‐ How is he gonna sign?
‐ He's not.

370
00:16:21,874 --> 00:16:24,941
Alright. It's okay.

371
00:16:24,974 --> 00:16:26,174
'Mommy's here.
It's going to be okay.'

372
00:16:26,207 --> 00:16:27,974
I'm sorry, I just looked
away for a second

373
00:16:28,007 --> 00:16:30,174
and he was at the piano.

374
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:32,807
Listen, uh, why don't you
give us a few minutes, okay?

375
00:16:32,841 --> 00:16:34,074
Of course.

376
00:16:37,774 --> 00:16:38,974
Hey.

377
00:16:39,007 --> 00:16:40,241
This is your fault,
you know?

378
00:16:40,274 --> 00:16:41,641
I am so sorry.

379
00:16:41,674 --> 00:16:43,207
Uh‐huh. Reese is
not like other children.

380
00:16:43,241 --> 00:16:44,707
I know.

381
00:16:44,741 --> 00:16:46,307
Then how come you
didn't stay in his eyeline?

382
00:16:46,341 --> 00:16:47,807
It was an accident.

383
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:49,107
Carla, I don't know
what else to say.

384
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:52,074
I feel horrible
about this.

385
00:16:52,107 --> 00:16:53,974
I want you to stay
away from my son.

386
00:16:54,007 --> 00:16:55,607
Carla, can we just‐‐

387
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:57,607
What would have happened
if you had turned away again?

388
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,707
What would've happened if Reese
had run out into the street?

389
00:16:59,741 --> 00:17:01,707
He is deaf! You cannot
just call out to him!

390
00:17:01,741 --> 00:17:02,841
Alright‐alright,
Carla, Carla..

391
00:17:02,874 --> 00:17:04,174
You have to be
with him every second!

392
00:17:04,207 --> 00:17:05,841
I don't want
to see this bitch!

393
00:17:05,874 --> 00:17:07,707
‐ I said back off!
‐ Anywhere near Reese again..

394
00:17:07,741 --> 00:17:09,674
‐ You hear me, Peter?
‐ Go.

395
00:17:28,841 --> 00:17:30,207
‐ Hey.
‐ Hi.

396
00:17:30,241 --> 00:17:32,307
Hit and run.
ETA is five minutes.

397
00:17:35,007 --> 00:17:37,607
Kind of like, uh,
waiting for thunder

398
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:39,074
after the
lightning strikes.

399
00:17:47,207 --> 00:17:49,641
Dr. Legaspi and I..

400
00:17:52,907 --> 00:17:54,107
It ended.

401
00:17:56,674 --> 00:17:58,207
'I'm sorry.'

402
00:18:01,907 --> 00:18:03,107
Something changed?

403
00:18:04,974 --> 00:18:06,107
Yes.

404
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,274
Do you love her?

405
00:18:18,141 --> 00:18:20,541
Then you should go
forward, not back, hmm?

406
00:18:30,107 --> 00:18:31,974
50 year old male changing
a blowout on the shoulder

407
00:18:32,007 --> 00:18:33,841
got sideswiped by a car.
LOC at the scene.

408
00:18:33,874 --> 00:18:35,607
But started coming around
in the rig.

409
00:18:35,641 --> 00:18:37,974
Obvious femur
fracture. Vitals?

410
00:18:38,007 --> 00:18:40,341
Initial at 90 palp.
BP's up to 115/70.

411
00:18:40,374 --> 00:18:42,207
'after 1500cc's of saline.'

412
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:43,641
'Sir, can you
tell us your name?'

413
00:18:43,674 --> 00:18:45,207
Jim Vogel.
God, my legs!

414
00:18:45,241 --> 00:18:47,341
‐ Trauma two. Go.
‐ 'Serial crits.'

415
00:18:47,374 --> 00:18:49,574
Type and cross times four get
a C‐spine, chest and pelvis.

416
00:18:49,607 --> 00:18:52,107
Got one more, doc.
She won't come out.

417
00:18:52,141 --> 00:18:53,307
Restrained, but got
a small forehead LAC

418
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:54,807
from the rearview mirror.

419
00:18:54,841 --> 00:18:56,041
Brother said she's
developmentally challenged.

420
00:18:56,074 --> 00:18:57,841
‐ This is her baseline.
‐ What's her name?

421
00:18:57,874 --> 00:19:00,574
Won't say. I'm not sure
she understands the question.

422
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:04,174
'Hi, I'm Dr. Weaver.
Can you tell me who you are?'

423
00:19:04,207 --> 00:19:05,874
Jim's sister.

424
00:19:05,907 --> 00:19:07,574
Okay, well,
we need to make sure

425
00:19:07,607 --> 00:19:09,207
you're not seriously hurt,
so can you come out?

426
00:19:09,241 --> 00:19:11,074
‐ I want to go again.
‐ I'm sorry?

427
00:19:11,107 --> 00:19:12,674
On a ride. It's fun.

428
00:19:12,707 --> 00:19:13,807
She's been smiling like this

429
00:19:13,841 --> 00:19:15,007
ever since they
got her on the rig.

430
00:19:16,374 --> 00:19:17,574
Here we go.

431
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,574
Crepitation's on the right

432
00:19:20,607 --> 00:19:22,941
with decreased air entry.
I need that chest tube.

433
00:19:22,974 --> 00:19:24,107
Tachy at 110.
I'll set it up.

434
00:19:24,141 --> 00:19:25,674
God, I can't stand it!

435
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:27,307
‐ What'd you got so far?
‐ Pneumo on the right.

436
00:19:27,341 --> 00:19:29,207
Unstable pelvis
and fractured right hip.

437
00:19:29,241 --> 00:19:30,807
Where's Bonnie?
Is she alright?

438
00:19:30,841 --> 00:19:32,641
‐ Is that your sister's name?
‐ Yeah.

439
00:19:32,674 --> 00:19:34,074
Another doctor
is checking her

440
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:36,341
and she appears to have
only minor injuries.

441
00:19:36,374 --> 00:19:39,741
Mr. Vogel, does Bonnie have
any medical conditions

442
00:19:39,774 --> 00:19:41,307
other than her
developmental delay?

443
00:19:41,341 --> 00:19:43,641
No, she's‐she's
always been healthy.

444
00:19:43,674 --> 00:19:44,741
Okay.

445
00:19:56,007 --> 00:19:58,607
'In reality, I was used
to being disappointed..'

446
00:20:02,841 --> 00:20:04,141
Sorry I'm late.

447
00:20:04,174 --> 00:20:06,241
It's fine. We're glad
you could join us.

448
00:20:16,241 --> 00:20:18,307
‐ Hi.
‐ Hi.

449
00:20:18,341 --> 00:20:20,007
Please know that
we both understand

450
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:23,274
how awkward it can be to step
into someone else's therapy.

451
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:24,807
It's okay. I'm fine.

452
00:20:27,074 --> 00:20:28,807
Maggie, do you want
to continue?

453
00:20:28,841 --> 00:20:31,674
Sure, um..

454
00:20:31,707 --> 00:20:37,141
So, uh, Dr. Legaspi
and I were talking about..

455
00:20:37,174 --> 00:20:38,874
...well, we were talking
about a lot of things

456
00:20:38,907 --> 00:20:42,341
'but we were talking about ways
that I could stay healthy.'

457
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:45,074
You know, how to
position myself to..

458
00:20:45,107 --> 00:20:47,241
...get it together,
keep on track and um..

459
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:52,107
Part of that is..

460
00:20:52,141 --> 00:20:54,641
...that I've
decided to go home.

461
00:20:57,707 --> 00:21:01,207
‐ Have you talked to Eric?
‐ No, not Florida.

462
00:21:01,241 --> 00:21:02,641
Um, home‐home.

463
00:21:02,674 --> 00:21:04,741
I‐I'm going back
to Minnesota.

464
00:21:10,174 --> 00:21:11,141
Uh..

465
00:21:13,007 --> 00:21:17,007
Uh, you‐you haven't been
to Minneapolis in 15 years, mom.

466
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:19,774
I know that.
I know I‐I haven't.

467
00:21:19,807 --> 00:21:22,307
But I grew up there,
and I feel like I belong there.

468
00:21:22,341 --> 00:21:25,207
'I've got, you know, a little
bit of family and some friends.'

469
00:21:25,241 --> 00:21:26,907
What friends?

470
00:21:26,941 --> 00:21:30,641
Gina. You remember Gina?

471
00:21:30,674 --> 00:21:32,641
'Well, I'm gonna
stay with her and..'

472
00:21:32,674 --> 00:21:33,841
'She has a spare room.'

473
00:21:33,874 --> 00:21:35,241
She thinks she
could get me a job

474
00:21:35,274 --> 00:21:37,307
at the Convalescent Hospital
where she works.

475
00:21:37,341 --> 00:21:40,607
Really? And when did
you arrange all this?

476
00:21:40,641 --> 00:21:42,241
Last week. I..

477
00:21:42,274 --> 00:21:44,041
She accepted a collect
phone call from me.

478
00:21:44,074 --> 00:21:45,707
She was glad
to hear from me, Abby.

479
00:21:45,741 --> 00:21:48,074
'She was glad
to talk to me.'

480
00:21:51,374 --> 00:21:54,041
Anyway, I‐I, I'll,
I'll save enough money

481
00:21:54,074 --> 00:21:55,307
and I'll get
a place of my own.

482
00:21:56,874 --> 00:21:58,941
A place of your own?

483
00:21:58,974 --> 00:22:00,641
'Yes, a place of my own.'

484
00:22:00,674 --> 00:22:04,607
With no roommates, no men,
just me. Maybe a cat.

485
00:22:04,641 --> 00:22:07,741
A cat? That would be
a great pet, a cat.

486
00:22:07,774 --> 00:22:09,574
Abby, are you reacting
to your mother's plans?

487
00:22:09,607 --> 00:22:11,907
I'm not reacting.

488
00:22:11,941 --> 00:22:16,807
I...I'm just..

489
00:22:16,841 --> 00:22:18,841
Just‐just what?

490
00:22:18,874 --> 00:22:20,107
Nothing.

491
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:24,641
Abby, I can't
stay here, in Chicago.

492
00:22:24,674 --> 00:22:26,007
I don't want
to go to Florida.

493
00:22:27,807 --> 00:22:30,807
It's just too easy for me
to be a drain on you and‐‐

494
00:22:30,841 --> 00:22:34,707
You know, I think we're
way past that at this point.

495
00:22:34,741 --> 00:22:36,307
What is your objection
to your mother going home?

496
00:22:36,341 --> 00:22:38,907
Nothing.
It's very romantic.

497
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:41,941
You're not happy about it?

498
00:22:44,274 --> 00:22:46,207
I...I don't know what‐what
you want me to say.

499
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:48,574
Yippee, she's going home?

500
00:22:48,607 --> 00:22:52,274
'Fabulous. That solves
all the problems? Uh, what?'

501
00:22:52,307 --> 00:22:53,741
Then what is your solution?

502
00:22:53,774 --> 00:22:56,841
I don't have a solution.
I‐I don't have..

503
00:22:56,874 --> 00:22:58,141
I don't think
there is a solution.

504
00:22:58,174 --> 00:23:00,307
'And to talk about
this as if it were'

505
00:23:00,341 --> 00:23:02,074
some sort of
"life‐management" problem

506
00:23:02,107 --> 00:23:05,107
that you can plan your out
of is...well, it's absurd.

507
00:23:05,141 --> 00:23:07,741
Then what do you suggest?

508
00:23:07,774 --> 00:23:09,174
I‐I don't know.

509
00:23:13,974 --> 00:23:15,941
You know what? I don't know.
I don't know.

510
00:23:18,807 --> 00:23:20,274
So, I guess you're right.

511
00:23:20,307 --> 00:23:21,941
You have to do
something, mom. Good luck.

512
00:23:23,341 --> 00:23:24,741
So, what, you're leaving?

513
00:23:24,774 --> 00:23:26,674
You wanted to tell me.
You told me.

514
00:23:26,707 --> 00:23:28,641
Well, I'm not going
for a week or so.

515
00:23:28,674 --> 00:23:30,774
Okay, great.
See you later.

516
00:23:40,662 --> 00:23:41,996
When did Ben Fossen's
father arrive?

517
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:44,362
‐ A while ago.
‐ Someone should've told me.

518
00:23:47,396 --> 00:23:48,862
Hi, I'm Dr. Greene.

519
00:23:48,896 --> 00:23:51,929
Derek Fossen. Thanks
for taking care of him.

520
00:23:51,962 --> 00:23:53,929
Sure. Could we
talk outside?

521
00:23:53,962 --> 00:23:55,862
Yeah. I'll be
right outside, Ben.

522
00:23:59,429 --> 00:24:01,696
Mrs. Shayotovich
told me about the fire.

523
00:24:01,729 --> 00:24:03,596
‐ Your neighbor?
‐ No.

524
00:24:03,629 --> 00:24:04,996
He's always getting
into trouble.

525
00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:06,629
‐ Yeah?
‐ Yeah.

526
00:24:06,662 --> 00:24:08,029
His mom's
out of the picture

527
00:24:08,062 --> 00:24:09,529
and I think
it makes him act out.

528
00:24:09,562 --> 00:24:11,462
Mm‐hmm. Well, those
burns will heal.

529
00:24:11,496 --> 00:24:13,062
Oh, good. Thanks.

530
00:24:13,096 --> 00:24:15,929
I'm just waiting on the
psychiatrist come talk to Ben.

531
00:24:15,962 --> 00:24:17,962
Psychiatrist? Why?

532
00:24:17,996 --> 00:24:21,696
We found some unusual bruising
on your son, Mr. Fossen.

533
00:24:21,729 --> 00:24:23,796
‐ Do you know about that?
‐ No.

534
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:25,996
You've never
noticed the bruises?

535
00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:28,396
Well, he gets
into scrapes at school.

536
00:24:28,429 --> 00:24:30,496
‐ Fights?
‐ Yeah.

537
00:24:30,529 --> 00:24:32,762
‐ Any serious injuries?
‐ No more than any kid.

538
00:24:34,429 --> 00:24:36,029
Well, I'm sure he'll
tell that to the doctor.

539
00:24:36,062 --> 00:24:37,896
Look, he doesn't need
a psychiatrist

540
00:24:37,929 --> 00:24:39,429
and I have to get
back to work, so‐‐

541
00:24:39,462 --> 00:24:41,296
I know, I know.
This won't take long.

542
00:24:50,929 --> 00:24:53,729
We're supposed
to be at the park.

543
00:24:53,762 --> 00:24:55,296
Is that where you were driving?

544
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,362
2:00 to 4:00
we go to the park.

545
00:25:00,062 --> 00:25:01,762
But we had a crash.

546
00:25:03,862 --> 00:25:05,462
I know.

547
00:25:06,462 --> 00:25:08,062
My parents had a crash.

548
00:25:11,096 --> 00:25:12,696
When's Jimmy coming back?

549
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,429
I don't know.

550
00:25:18,629 --> 00:25:20,996
Did they die in the crash?
Your parents?

551
00:25:24,762 --> 00:25:27,029
So what do you do...in
the park, Bonnie?

552
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:30,362
‐ The slide.
‐ Hmm!

553
00:25:31,729 --> 00:25:34,362
‐ Anything else?
‐ The swing.

554
00:25:34,396 --> 00:25:36,096
You know,
Jimmy pushes me..

555
00:25:36,129 --> 00:25:38,896
...not too high, though.

556
00:25:38,929 --> 00:25:40,962
Do you have any other
brothers or sisters?

557
00:25:40,996 --> 00:25:42,629
Nope.

558
00:25:44,129 --> 00:25:45,796
C‐spine is clear.

559
00:25:45,829 --> 00:25:48,396
No perihepatic fluid,
but I can't see the spleen.

560
00:25:48,429 --> 00:25:50,096
‐ Where's Bonnie?
‐ She's fine.

561
00:25:50,129 --> 00:25:52,029
‐ She's getting some sutures.
‐ Oh, thank God.

562
00:25:52,062 --> 00:25:54,796
Minimal blood in the Thora Seal
but his repeat crit is 34.

563
00:25:54,829 --> 00:25:56,696
‐ He's bleeding from somewhere.
‐ Probably here.

564
00:25:56,729 --> 00:25:58,962
‐ 'What's wrong?'
‐ You shattered your pelvis.

565
00:25:58,996 --> 00:26:00,696
‐ 'That'll heal, though, right?'
‐ Yes.

566
00:26:00,729 --> 00:26:02,762
But the edges of the bone
may be cutting an artery.

567
00:26:02,796 --> 00:26:04,096
We need to do
a CAT scan to see

568
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:05,596
where the bleeding
is coming from.

569
00:26:05,629 --> 00:26:07,329
'Lydia, call radiology.'

570
00:26:07,362 --> 00:26:10,329
'Tell 'em we need abdomen
and pelvis with contrast.'

571
00:26:10,362 --> 00:26:12,329
‐ Will I need surgery?
‐ We'll know after the scan.

572
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,796
Because I can't be laid up.
My sister‐‐

573
00:26:13,829 --> 00:26:16,362
Yes, yes, I know.
We'll try to stop the bleeding

574
00:26:16,396 --> 00:26:18,729
by injecting a clotting
agent into the artery.

575
00:26:18,762 --> 00:26:20,662
BP is down to 95/60.

576
00:26:20,696 --> 00:26:22,596
Okay, hang
another two units

577
00:26:22,629 --> 00:26:24,629
and call for six
type‐specific.

578
00:26:24,662 --> 00:26:25,896
Okay, we need to go now.

579
00:26:27,429 --> 00:26:28,862
I'm gonna bring Carla home.

580
00:26:28,896 --> 00:26:30,796
Then go by your place
to pick up his stuff.

581
00:26:30,829 --> 00:26:32,729
Fine.

582
00:26:32,762 --> 00:26:33,962
Listen, Cleo,
I told you. You know.

583
00:26:33,996 --> 00:26:35,329
Reese, he needs
special attention.

584
00:26:35,362 --> 00:26:37,596
Peter, I know that.
I made a mistake.

585
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:39,396
Alright.

586
00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:41,929
You know, but you're acting like
I deliberately let him get hurt.

587
00:26:41,962 --> 00:26:43,829
I'm sorry
about what happened.

588
00:26:43,862 --> 00:26:45,396
Carla gets upset.

589
00:26:45,429 --> 00:26:47,829
Well, I don't get called
a bitch by anyone.

590
00:26:47,862 --> 00:26:48,996
'Bonnie?'

591
00:26:49,029 --> 00:26:50,362
Where are you
supposed to be?

592
00:26:50,396 --> 00:26:52,329
‐ Finding my brother.
‐ Okay.

593
00:26:53,596 --> 00:26:55,096
Jing‐Mei.

594
00:26:55,129 --> 00:26:57,096
Oh, Bonnie, you're supposed
to stay in that room.

595
00:26:57,129 --> 00:26:59,529
I have to tell my brother
what I want for dinner.

596
00:26:59,562 --> 00:27:00,762
Why is he back?

597
00:27:00,796 --> 00:27:02,562
Dropped his
pressure upstairs.

598
00:27:02,596 --> 00:27:03,696
There he is. Jimmy!

599
00:27:03,729 --> 00:27:05,662
'BP's only 80 palp.'

600
00:27:05,696 --> 00:27:08,962
'Hang another two units on the
infuser. What'd the scan show?'

601
00:27:08,996 --> 00:27:10,929
'He crashed before we even
got him on the table.'

602
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,562
'Dr. Weaver?'

603
00:27:12,596 --> 00:27:14,062
'Open a peritoneal lavage kit.'

604
00:27:14,096 --> 00:27:16,562
We'll go supra‐umbilical.
Lydia, drop an NG.

605
00:27:16,596 --> 00:27:17,962
My sister has special needs.

606
00:27:17,996 --> 00:27:19,362
Let's worry
about you right now.

607
00:27:19,396 --> 00:27:20,829
‐ 'Hemocue's ten.'
‐ 'Okay.'

608
00:27:20,862 --> 00:27:23,462
We need central access.
Somebody get Dr. Chen!

609
00:27:23,496 --> 00:27:24,796
There's no one else but me.

610
00:27:24,829 --> 00:27:27,562
Okay, Jim. Dr. Chen,
put in a subclavian.

611
00:27:27,596 --> 00:27:29,029
'Got it.'

612
00:27:29,062 --> 00:27:31,729
'Pressure's down to 70,
pulse ox dropped to 84.'

613
00:27:31,762 --> 00:27:33,729
Jim? Jim?

614
00:27:33,762 --> 00:27:35,629
He's not breathing.
Give me an 8‐0 tube!

615
00:27:35,662 --> 00:27:36,896
'Bag him on a 100%.'

616
00:27:36,929 --> 00:27:38,396
Get in that line!

617
00:27:40,129 --> 00:27:42,529
'Luka, if the tap
is positive he goes to the OR.'

618
00:27:42,562 --> 00:27:44,696
'If not, maybe we can
embolize the pelvic bleeders.'

619
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:45,796
‐ I'm in.
‐ Okay.

620
00:27:45,829 --> 00:27:46,996
Squeeze in
all the blood you can.

621
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:48,496
Call for eight more units.

622
00:27:48,529 --> 00:27:50,929
‐ Well, the hand's okay.
‐ Look at the wrist.

623
00:27:52,662 --> 00:27:54,096
Is that
a Colles fracture?

624
00:27:54,129 --> 00:27:55,796
Ben says he never
hurt his wrist.

625
00:27:55,829 --> 00:27:57,629
Or maybe he was
too young to remember it.

626
00:27:57,662 --> 00:27:59,696
His dad doesn't
remember, either.

627
00:27:59,729 --> 00:28:00,762
How'd your talk
go with him?

628
00:28:00,796 --> 00:28:02,629
Well, he's
a pretty hostile kid.

629
00:28:02,662 --> 00:28:04,429
Clammed up when
dad showed up, though.

630
00:28:04,462 --> 00:28:05,996
Yeah, it was hard
to talk to him.

631
00:28:06,029 --> 00:28:07,629
His dad was standing
outside the door

632
00:28:07,662 --> 00:28:08,929
the whole time
and Ben knew it.

633
00:28:08,962 --> 00:28:10,396
He's terrified of him.

634
00:28:10,429 --> 00:28:12,096
I think he is, but, uh..

635
00:28:12,129 --> 00:28:14,429
He says there's no
violence in the home.

636
00:28:14,462 --> 00:28:15,562
You saw that bruising.

637
00:28:15,596 --> 00:28:17,362
That's him getting
pulled by his ear.

638
00:28:17,396 --> 00:28:19,762
He says that he doesn't
remember how it happened.

639
00:28:19,796 --> 00:28:22,096
You don't forget a broken bone
or bruising like that.

640
00:28:22,129 --> 00:28:24,629
‐ 'Lost his pulse.'
‐ He'll never make it to angio.

641
00:28:24,662 --> 00:28:27,796
Pump in that blood. Order two
units of FFP. He's in V‐fib.

642
00:28:27,829 --> 00:28:29,329
Starting compressions.

643
00:28:29,362 --> 00:28:30,996
'Okay, charge to 200.'

644
00:28:31,029 --> 00:28:32,029
Clear.

645
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:35,729
‐ V‐fib.
‐ Thoracotomy tray.

646
00:28:35,762 --> 00:28:37,329
It's blunt trauma.

647
00:28:37,362 --> 00:28:38,829
It's an isolated
pelvic injury. Clear.

648
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:42,829
'Lydia, close the
blinds to suture.'

649
00:28:42,862 --> 00:28:43,862
'Still in fib.'

650
00:28:43,896 --> 00:28:46,462
'360. Clear.'

651
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:53,096
'I'm starving.'

652
00:28:53,129 --> 00:28:55,462
'What'd we pick
something up from Doc Magoo's.'

653
00:28:55,496 --> 00:28:57,796
You know, if I were smart,
I would have gone for lunch.

654
00:28:57,829 --> 00:29:00,896
Instead of getting reamed
by my mother and Legaspi..

655
00:29:00,929 --> 00:29:02,529
And I don't get it,
because a week ago

656
00:29:02,562 --> 00:29:03,829
she wanted
to have her committed

657
00:29:03,862 --> 00:29:05,696
and now she's
completely on her side.

658
00:29:05,729 --> 00:29:08,429
‐ Not about sides.
‐ Well, it felt like it was.

659
00:29:08,462 --> 00:29:10,896
All of a sudden, it was all
about me and what was my problem

660
00:29:10,929 --> 00:29:14,696
that I couldn't get on board
with this plan she figured out?

661
00:29:14,729 --> 00:29:16,996
Would any plan
have made you happy?

662
00:29:17,029 --> 00:29:18,529
No.

663
00:29:18,562 --> 00:29:20,362
When was the last time
your mom was in therapy?

664
00:29:21,496 --> 00:29:23,496
I don't know like,
10 years ago.

665
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:25,829
‐ That's different.
‐ Yeah.

666
00:29:25,862 --> 00:29:27,596
So, you've got a choice,
you are gonna either hope

667
00:29:27,629 --> 00:29:29,929
that she makes it
this time or...give up.

668
00:29:29,962 --> 00:29:31,462
Right.

669
00:29:31,496 --> 00:29:33,362
Doesn't seem like
you want to do that.

670
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:34,762
I don't know
what I want to do.

671
00:29:36,696 --> 00:29:38,062
Weaver dropped a bomb
on me this morning.

672
00:29:38,096 --> 00:29:39,496
'What happened?'

673
00:29:39,529 --> 00:29:41,062
She bagged me
for chief resident.

674
00:29:41,096 --> 00:29:42,829
Really?

675
00:29:42,862 --> 00:29:45,396
Apparently, my rehab
is caught up to me.

676
00:29:45,429 --> 00:29:48,062
Oh, no.
I'm sorry.

677
00:29:48,096 --> 00:29:49,529
It's not your fault.

678
00:29:49,562 --> 00:29:51,662
Not exactly.

679
00:29:51,696 --> 00:29:53,829
I guess part of facing
the problem is accepting

680
00:29:53,862 --> 00:29:55,429
that some people
won't get over it.

681
00:29:56,662 --> 00:29:57,762
I'm sorry, John.

682
00:29:58,929 --> 00:30:00,029
Me, too.

683
00:30:01,029 --> 00:30:02,329
For you.

684
00:30:04,962 --> 00:30:06,862
'Get a ten pack of platelets.'

685
00:30:06,896 --> 00:30:09,029
‐ Heart's not filling.
‐ 'Units nine and ten are in.'

686
00:30:09,062 --> 00:30:11,029
‐ 'Hold compressions.'
‐ 'Still in fib.'

687
00:30:11,062 --> 00:30:12,862
‐ 'Vasopressin'?'
‐ 'On board.'

688
00:30:12,896 --> 00:30:15,062
'Another 100 of lido.
I'll take the internal paddles.'

689
00:30:15,096 --> 00:30:17,062
‐ How long's he been down?
‐ Thirty‐Five minutes.

690
00:30:17,096 --> 00:30:18,462
Charge to 20.

691
00:30:18,496 --> 00:30:19,729
Jimmy?

692
00:30:19,762 --> 00:30:21,396
Bonnie, you have to go outside.

693
00:30:21,429 --> 00:30:23,629
Clear!

694
00:30:23,662 --> 00:30:26,429
‐ I don't like that.
‐ Charge again.

695
00:30:26,462 --> 00:30:28,629
‐ Lydia, Lydia, Lydia.
‐ I don't want you to do that!

696
00:30:28,662 --> 00:30:29,962
No, we‐we're trying
to help him.

697
00:30:29,996 --> 00:30:31,329
But it hurts him!

698
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:32,896
‐ Clear!
‐ 'It hurts him.'

699
00:30:34,929 --> 00:30:36,029
'Charge again.'

700
00:30:36,896 --> 00:30:37,862
'Clear.'

701
00:30:40,929 --> 00:30:42,396
Heart's empty.

702
00:30:42,429 --> 00:30:43,829
Asystole.

703
00:30:43,862 --> 00:30:44,962
Should we try pacing him?

704
00:30:47,896 --> 00:30:49,296
Okay, that is it.

705
00:30:50,762 --> 00:30:52,462
Time of death?

706
00:30:52,496 --> 00:30:54,429
17:10.

707
00:30:54,462 --> 00:30:56,796
‐ Can you close the chest up?
‐ Yeah.

708
00:30:56,829 --> 00:30:59,029
Clean him up but leave
the tubes in for the coroner.

709
00:31:00,062 --> 00:31:01,362
I'll tell his sister.

710
00:31:10,462 --> 00:31:11,829
Want me to
come with you?

711
00:31:11,862 --> 00:31:12,829
Yeah.

712
00:31:21,696 --> 00:31:22,962
'I'm‐I'm tired of it, here.'

713
00:31:22,996 --> 00:31:25,029
'I think Jimmy and me
should go home.'

714
00:31:25,062 --> 00:31:27,729
Well, the doctors are going
to talk to you now.

715
00:31:27,762 --> 00:31:30,462
‐ Hi, Bonnie.
‐ Hi.

716
00:31:30,496 --> 00:31:33,862
Bonnie, this is
your brother's doctor.

717
00:31:33,896 --> 00:31:35,762
Is he ready to go?

718
00:31:35,796 --> 00:31:37,829
Bonnie, Jim was very hurt.

719
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:40,029
And he couldn't recover
from his injuries.

720
00:31:41,662 --> 00:31:43,662
‐ Cover?
‐ Get better.

721
00:31:46,096 --> 00:31:48,429
Your brother died, Bonnie,
I'm sorry.

722
00:31:50,096 --> 00:31:51,396
'Do you understand?'

723
00:31:53,096 --> 00:31:54,696
Like Ernie.

724
00:31:54,729 --> 00:31:56,496
He died.

725
00:31:56,529 --> 00:31:57,696
Um, who's Ernie?

726
00:31:58,529 --> 00:32:00,029
My hamster.

727
00:32:00,062 --> 00:32:01,462
We put him in a box.

728
00:32:02,929 --> 00:32:04,696
'Okay.'

729
00:32:04,729 --> 00:32:08,096
Well, like your hamster,
Jim won't be with you anymore.

730
00:32:08,129 --> 00:32:10,662
I got a new hamster.
His name is Ernie, too.

731
00:32:13,029 --> 00:32:15,562
You know how
your parents went away?

732
00:32:15,596 --> 00:32:16,696
In the crash?

733
00:32:18,596 --> 00:32:20,396
Jimmy went away
like that too.

734
00:32:24,129 --> 00:32:26,429
But it's library night.

735
00:32:26,462 --> 00:32:28,029
'I know.'

736
00:32:28,062 --> 00:32:29,529
And I get scared at night.

737
00:32:31,062 --> 00:32:33,896
Bonnie, you're gonna
have to be very brave.

738
00:32:36,729 --> 00:32:38,362
Where's Jimmy?

739
00:32:42,696 --> 00:32:43,996
There you are.

740
00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:46,629
‐ Hi.
‐ Do you have a minute?

741
00:32:46,662 --> 00:32:48,962
Sure. Am I in trouble
or something?

742
00:32:48,996 --> 00:32:51,396
I don't usually do this,
but I think that it's important.

743
00:32:51,429 --> 00:32:52,796
Okay.

744
00:32:52,829 --> 00:32:55,496
I think you need to give
your mom one more chance.

745
00:32:55,529 --> 00:32:56,996
Didn't I just do that,
today?

746
00:32:57,029 --> 00:32:59,429
Well, you started to,
and then you ran away.

747
00:32:59,462 --> 00:33:00,596
Maybe that's because,
I've heard it

748
00:33:00,629 --> 00:33:01,929
about a hundred times,
before.

749
00:33:01,962 --> 00:33:03,329
I think this time
it's different.

750
00:33:03,362 --> 00:33:05,096
Do you? Why?

751
00:33:05,129 --> 00:33:06,762
Well, for one thing,
she hasn't been willing

752
00:33:06,796 --> 00:33:09,062
to go to therapy for ten years
now, she's embracing it.

753
00:33:09,096 --> 00:33:11,862
I'd love to believe,
that meant something.

754
00:33:11,896 --> 00:33:13,362
Don't let your mom go away

755
00:33:13,396 --> 00:33:15,329
without being able
to really talk to you.

756
00:33:15,362 --> 00:33:16,662
That won't make,
either of you happy.

757
00:33:16,696 --> 00:33:19,562
I don't think happy
is on the table.

758
00:33:19,596 --> 00:33:22,696
‐ Why not?
‐ Look, I'm not in therapy.

759
00:33:24,829 --> 00:33:26,329
Fair enough.

760
00:33:27,596 --> 00:33:29,596
But I'll consider it.

761
00:33:30,929 --> 00:33:32,596
What you said.

762
00:33:32,629 --> 00:33:33,862
Okay.

763
00:33:35,796 --> 00:33:36,796
She has the mind
of a seven‐year‐old.

764
00:33:36,829 --> 00:33:37,862
No other relatives?

765
00:33:37,896 --> 00:33:40,462
Her brother
was her only family.

766
00:33:40,496 --> 00:33:43,329
I tried ARC, protection
and advocacy, no luck.

767
00:33:43,362 --> 00:33:44,829
Well, the facilities
were all full.

768
00:33:44,862 --> 00:33:46,596
She'll have to take a
temporary place at a group home.

769
00:33:46,629 --> 00:33:48,529
No, I don't want her,
sent to a place like that.

770
00:33:48,562 --> 00:33:50,662
I mean, they've got four
or five people in every room.

771
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:51,762
Well, unless you want
to take her home

772
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:53,096
this is all, I can offer.

773
00:33:53,129 --> 00:33:55,096
Okay, but‐but
I don't want to hear

774
00:33:55,129 --> 00:33:56,896
about her, sleeping on
a couch or on the floor.

775
00:33:56,929 --> 00:33:58,796
Alright, well,
I'll pass that along.

776
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:00,096
You'll have to
get her there, yourself.

777
00:34:00,129 --> 00:34:01,629
They're too backed up
to come, pick her up.

778
00:34:01,662 --> 00:34:04,062
‐ Oh, come on!
‐ I'm just the messenger.

779
00:34:04,096 --> 00:34:05,096
Look, in time,
she'll adjust.

780
00:34:05,129 --> 00:34:06,529
Adele, this stinks.

781
00:34:06,562 --> 00:34:08,329
They've got job
training programs

782
00:34:08,362 --> 00:34:09,929
and hopefully,
she'll learn a skill.

783
00:34:09,962 --> 00:34:11,429
Adele, ready?

784
00:34:11,462 --> 00:34:13,562
Oh, yeah.
Sorry.

785
00:34:19,662 --> 00:34:20,962
It's about time.

786
00:34:20,996 --> 00:34:22,896
Ben has not eaten,
since noon.

787
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:24,862
‐ 'We'll get him something.'
‐ We'd rather just go.

788
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,362
Mr. Fossen,
this is Adele Neumann.

789
00:34:26,396 --> 00:34:27,829
‐ She's a social worker.
‐ Hi.

790
00:34:27,862 --> 00:34:29,529
‐ Hi, Ben.
‐ Hi.

791
00:34:29,562 --> 00:34:31,996
Look, my kid does not need
any more counseling or whatever.

792
00:34:32,029 --> 00:34:34,329
I'm afraid Ben's gonna have
to stay here for a few days.

793
00:34:34,362 --> 00:34:35,662
What?

794
00:34:35,696 --> 00:34:37,462
We're taking him into
emergency custody.

795
00:34:37,496 --> 00:34:39,362
What are you
talking about? What for?

796
00:34:39,396 --> 00:34:41,396
I'm not comfortable with the
bruising I found on your son.

797
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:43,562
Oh, God forbid
you're not comfortable.

798
00:34:43,596 --> 00:34:45,562
And I also found evidence
of a broken wrist

799
00:34:45,596 --> 00:34:46,762
'which neither
of you mentioned.'

800
00:34:46,796 --> 00:34:48,696
I told you that he fights.

801
00:34:48,729 --> 00:34:49,729
‐ Would you tell them, please?
‐ I fight a lot.

802
00:34:49,762 --> 00:34:51,062
You know what, if that's true

803
00:34:51,096 --> 00:34:52,996
then you'll get to go home
in three days.

804
00:34:53,029 --> 00:34:54,662
‐ But right now, I need you to‐‐
‐ I don't want to.

805
00:34:54,696 --> 00:34:56,429
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
You're not doing this!

806
00:34:56,462 --> 00:34:57,729
You're not doing this to us!

807
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,029
Security!

808
00:35:00,062 --> 00:35:01,462
Get your hands off from me!

809
00:35:01,496 --> 00:35:03,429
You don't have a choice here,
Mr. Fossen.

810
00:35:03,462 --> 00:35:05,029
You think I hurt my kid?
You're crazy.

811
00:35:05,062 --> 00:35:06,729
I suggest you contact,
a lawyer.

812
00:35:06,762 --> 00:35:09,096
‐ They'd sue your ass!
‐ It's for your protection, Ben.

813
00:35:09,129 --> 00:35:11,629
I don't want to go away!
Please let me stay with him!

814
00:35:11,662 --> 00:35:12,829
‐ I'm sorry.
‐ Leave him alone!

815
00:35:12,862 --> 00:35:14,862
‐ I'm sorry.
‐ No! Dad! Please!

816
00:35:14,896 --> 00:35:16,862
‐ You bastard!
‐ Please!

817
00:35:16,896 --> 00:35:19,829
‐ Why are you doing this to us?
‐ Dad! Dad!

818
00:35:24,962 --> 00:35:27,429
‐ Hi.
‐ Hi.

819
00:35:27,462 --> 00:35:30,496
Guess what? The super,
finally fixed the stove fan.

820
00:35:30,529 --> 00:35:31,762
So, I cooked dinner.

821
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,996
Cucumber soup,
a little salmon.

822
00:35:35,529 --> 00:35:36,729
Why don't you invite,
Luka to dinner?

823
00:35:36,762 --> 00:35:38,762
He's playin' softball.

824
00:35:38,796 --> 00:35:41,029
That sounds like fun.
Are you gonna go?

825
00:35:41,062 --> 00:35:42,962
I don't play, um..

826
00:35:46,996 --> 00:35:48,796
The reason why,
I ran out today

827
00:35:48,829 --> 00:35:51,529
like that, is because
it's just, um..

828
00:35:52,896 --> 00:35:55,496
It's scary to hope
too much, you know?

829
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:59,496
Yeah, I know.

830
00:36:01,362 --> 00:36:04,362
I know, I might not make it,
but Abby..

831
00:36:06,396 --> 00:36:08,996
...something happened to me,
in that ICU room.

832
00:36:09,029 --> 00:36:12,396
I realized
I don't wanna die.

833
00:36:13,996 --> 00:36:15,996
And more than that..

834
00:36:16,029 --> 00:36:17,862
I don't want my little girl
to watch me die.

835
00:36:17,896 --> 00:36:19,962
I can't do that to you,
not ever.

836
00:36:21,396 --> 00:36:23,562
That's what I wanted
to tell you today.

837
00:36:25,696 --> 00:36:28,362
I'm gonna handle my life.

838
00:36:28,396 --> 00:36:30,796
And I want you to
get on with yours.

839
00:36:35,496 --> 00:36:37,296
Okay.

840
00:36:38,562 --> 00:36:40,762
You can't put your life
on hold anymore.

841
00:36:40,796 --> 00:36:42,362
‐ It's not on hold.
‐ What do you mean?

842
00:36:42,396 --> 00:36:44,396
You won't even go play softball,
with your boyfriend.

843
00:36:44,429 --> 00:36:45,562
So? I don't wanna play.

844
00:36:45,596 --> 00:36:47,996
Stop sitting things out,
Abby.

845
00:36:48,029 --> 00:36:50,029
I don't.

846
00:36:50,062 --> 00:36:51,562
Yes, you do.

847
00:36:51,596 --> 00:36:53,396
You can't use me
as the reason

848
00:36:53,429 --> 00:36:55,496
for not doing the things,
you want to do in life.

849
00:36:55,529 --> 00:36:57,596
‐ Go to medical school.
‐ Well, that's not so easy.

850
00:36:57,629 --> 00:36:59,029
‐ Get married.
‐ I was married.

851
00:36:59,062 --> 00:37:01,496
‐ Get pregnant!
‐ I was pregnant!

852
00:37:02,862 --> 00:37:04,929
What happened?

853
00:37:06,862 --> 00:37:08,529
What happened.

854
00:37:15,096 --> 00:37:17,529
I had an abortion.

855
00:37:22,462 --> 00:37:25,296
Some people aren't
meant to be mothers.

856
00:37:28,696 --> 00:37:32,996
Abby, I was a lot younger
than you are now

857
00:37:33,029 --> 00:37:35,996
when I had my first
manic episode.

858
00:37:36,029 --> 00:37:38,029
I've watched you since,
you were a little girl.

859
00:37:38,062 --> 00:37:39,529
You're not bipolar.

860
00:37:39,562 --> 00:37:41,096
No, but my kids could be.

861
00:37:41,129 --> 00:37:42,662
But they might not be.

862
00:37:42,696 --> 00:37:44,029
They could be anything

863
00:37:44,062 --> 00:37:47,462
and you would just love them,
that's all.

864
00:37:50,529 --> 00:37:52,796
You never even
told Richard, did you?

865
00:37:54,529 --> 00:37:58,629
No, I...I think that was
the beginning of the end for us

866
00:37:58,662 --> 00:38:01,696
'cause we just stopped
talking about everything.

867
00:38:02,796 --> 00:38:04,762
I just was, too scared.

868
00:38:06,362 --> 00:38:09,362
I cou..
I couldn't risk it.

869
00:38:09,396 --> 00:38:12,362
I just,
I didn't, want to..

870
00:38:14,596 --> 00:38:16,862
‐ Turn into me.
‐ Yeah.

871
00:38:16,896 --> 00:38:19,829
Or have to end up
taking care of another me?

872
00:38:21,729 --> 00:38:22,962
Oh, honey.

873
00:38:22,996 --> 00:38:25,296
Oh, sweetie,
sweetie, sweetie.

874
00:38:26,562 --> 00:38:29,329
That's all
there is, is risk.

875
00:38:29,362 --> 00:38:32,396
You just have to take a chance
and leap into life.

876
00:38:33,762 --> 00:38:35,896
Otherwise, sweetheart,
you're going to miss out

877
00:38:35,929 --> 00:38:37,696
on all the great things.

878
00:38:39,096 --> 00:38:41,496
Abby, you deserve,
all the great things.

879
00:38:43,462 --> 00:38:45,062
Do you hear me?

880
00:38:49,662 --> 00:38:51,362
But I like, my home.

881
00:38:51,396 --> 00:38:53,896
Someone there
will take good care of you.

882
00:38:55,097 --> 00:38:57,130
This man's gonna
drive you, okay?

883
00:38:57,164 --> 00:38:59,530
Jimmy was gonna make me
hot dogs tonight.

884
00:38:59,564 --> 00:39:01,197
Okay, take this woman
to this address

885
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:04,230
and make sure she's met by
an adult before you leave, okay?

886
00:39:04,264 --> 00:39:07,097
‐ Yeah, alright.
‐ Will they have hot dogs?

887
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:09,864
I don't know, but I'm sure
they'll have something good.

888
00:39:09,897 --> 00:39:10,930
Here you go.

889
00:39:10,964 --> 00:39:13,064
I better go to my home.

890
00:39:13,097 --> 00:39:15,164
I'm sorry, you can't.

891
00:39:15,197 --> 00:39:16,664
But I like my home.

892
00:39:16,697 --> 00:39:18,697
I like my bed
and my blanket.

893
00:39:19,797 --> 00:39:21,764
Bonnie, you can't live alone.

894
00:39:23,297 --> 00:39:25,664
But I need my blanket.

895
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:27,597
Jimmy always
gives me my blanket.

896
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:29,197
Yeah, there'll be someone there
to give you one, okay?

897
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:32,497
And he gives me,
hot dogs when I want.

898
00:39:33,664 --> 00:39:34,930
'I like my home.'

899
00:39:34,964 --> 00:39:36,130
'I don't want a new one.'

900
00:39:36,164 --> 00:39:37,664
Bonnie..

901
00:39:40,764 --> 00:39:44,230
Zip‐up your jacket, sweetie,
it's chilly.

902
00:40:06,964 --> 00:40:09,030
Hey, batter, batter!
No batter, no batter!

903
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:11,930
Strike one!

904
00:40:11,964 --> 00:40:14,030
‐ That's good, right?
‐ That's good.

905
00:40:14,064 --> 00:40:16,997
‐ 'Put it right here, doc.'
‐ You got it, big guy.

906
00:40:18,264 --> 00:40:19,664
Yes! Strike two!

907
00:40:19,697 --> 00:40:21,197
‐ 'Whoo!'
‐ 'It's alright.'

908
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,564
'Right here.'

909
00:40:24,597 --> 00:40:26,097
Luka, look alive, man.

910
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:27,130
'Hey, batter, batter!'

911
00:40:27,164 --> 00:40:29,664
No batter!
No batter!

912
00:40:29,697 --> 00:40:30,864
‐ Yes!
‐ Strike!

913
00:40:35,597 --> 00:40:36,797
‐ Changed your mind?
‐ Yeah.

914
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:38,164
I even brought
my own glove.

915
00:40:38,197 --> 00:40:39,897
‐ 'Hey, Abby, you playing?'
‐ Yeah.

916
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:41,064
Alright, then pick your weapon

917
00:40:41,097 --> 00:40:42,730
'cause you're up right,
after Carter.

918
00:40:42,764 --> 00:40:45,664
'Alright, guys keep your head
in the game.'

919
00:40:45,697 --> 00:40:46,764
'You brought your mom?'

920
00:40:46,797 --> 00:40:47,897
Go get 'em, John!

921
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:49,697
Thank you, Maggie.

922
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:50,997
Alright, Carter,
get in there now.

923
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:52,497
'You see it, right?'

924
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:53,897
Luka, I didn't know,
you played softball.

925
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:56,030
I don't. I'm last
in the batting order.

926
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:57,797
You should put Abby up,
She was an all‐star

927
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,264
on her little league team.

928
00:40:59,297 --> 00:41:01,530
‐ How about you?
‐ I'm just gonna watch.

929
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:04,097
All‐star?

930
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,964
I like you,
in that hat.

931
00:41:05,997 --> 00:41:08,197
Almost looked,
American huh?

932
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:09,497
Almost.

933
00:41:15,164 --> 00:41:17,230
Some vocabulary
for a seven‐year‐old.

934
00:41:17,264 --> 00:41:19,530
Bone survey turned up
bilateral, healed

935
00:41:19,564 --> 00:41:21,164
spiral fractures
of the radius.

936
00:41:21,197 --> 00:41:23,897
‐ So, you were right.
‐ Pin a rose on me.

937
00:41:25,297 --> 00:41:27,097
Kim.

938
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:28,264
Hi, Kerry.

939
00:41:28,297 --> 00:41:30,764
Um, this is for you.

940
00:41:30,797 --> 00:41:32,264
What is it?

941
00:41:32,297 --> 00:41:35,764
It's how I feel about things,
about, about you.

942
00:41:35,797 --> 00:41:38,964
And I never really told you,
and maybe it doesn't matter now

943
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,797
but I‐I wanted you to know.

944
00:41:43,164 --> 00:41:44,697
Okay.

945
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:52,964
You broke,
both your arms, Ben.

946
00:41:52,997 --> 00:41:54,830
No, they're fine.

947
00:41:54,864 --> 00:41:58,797
Uh, these're your X‐rays,
and these lines, are fractures.

948
00:42:00,597 --> 00:42:03,830
That was a long time ago.
I tripped at school.

949
00:42:03,864 --> 00:42:07,230
Uh, you don't get these
kind of breaks from fallin'.

950
00:42:08,697 --> 00:42:11,264
After I tripped,
I fell down the stairs.

951
00:42:11,297 --> 00:42:13,097
No, Ben.

952
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:14,930
You know,
what I think happened?

953
00:42:14,964 --> 00:42:17,897
I think somebody,
grabbed your arm

954
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:20,197
with two hands
and then twisted it.

955
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:22,964
'Like‐like you do
with a wet towel.'

956
00:42:25,164 --> 00:42:27,697
I'm bad, a lot.

957
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:29,064
You are?

958
00:42:31,864 --> 00:42:34,197
I make too much noise,
playing.

959
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:36,264
I leave messes.

960
00:42:36,297 --> 00:42:38,564
And dad punishes you?

961
00:42:42,864 --> 00:42:45,164
Well, how does
he punish you?

962
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:49,830
Sometimes, like you said.

963
00:42:49,864 --> 00:42:52,197
He calls 'em Indian burns.

964
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:54,497
Yeah?

965
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:57,797
It's my fault. He wouldn't
do it, if I wasn't bad.

966
00:42:57,830 --> 00:42:59,864
No, Ben.

967
00:42:59,897 --> 00:43:04,064
Nobody should break your arm,
no matter how bad you are.

968
00:43:04,097 --> 00:43:05,830
You understand?

969
00:43:05,864 --> 00:43:08,597
I don't care.
I just want to go home.

970
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:13,597
You can't go home
right now, Ben.

971
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:15,197
I'm sorry.

972
00:43:16,664 --> 00:43:18,630
Come on, Malik,
show 'em where you live!

973
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:21,264
‐ Yes!
‐ Whoo!

974
00:43:21,297 --> 00:43:24,730
‐ 'Run, Abby!'
‐ Run, Abby!

975
00:43:24,764 --> 00:43:26,830
'Way to go, Abby!'

976
00:43:29,164 --> 00:43:31,097
Brought your cheering
section, I see.

977
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:33,764
'That's my girl!
That's good!'

978
00:43:33,797 --> 00:43:36,097
Go get 'em.

979
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:38,130
Alright, Luka just
make contact with the ball.

980
00:43:38,164 --> 00:43:41,097
Just meet the ball like we
talked about, alright?

981
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:42,130
Hey.

982
00:43:42,164 --> 00:43:43,764
‐ 'Strike one!'
‐ 'Alright.'

983
00:43:43,797 --> 00:43:45,864
You were so great!
You were, great!

984
00:43:45,897 --> 00:43:46,964
Did you hear
me cheering?

985
00:43:46,997 --> 00:43:48,864
Yes.

986
00:43:48,897 --> 00:43:50,630
I think everybody
heard you cheering.

987
00:43:52,097 --> 00:43:55,597
‐ Strike two!
‐ Luka, don't crowd the plate!

988
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:56,764
What?

989
00:43:56,797 --> 00:43:58,064
The plate!

990
00:43:58,097 --> 00:44:00,230
Get back!

991
00:44:00,264 --> 00:44:02,030
He's very cute,
but he's no, Mickey Mantle.

992
00:44:02,064 --> 00:44:03,830
No.

993
00:44:03,864 --> 00:44:06,197
Ball one!

994
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:08,264
‐ Are you cold?
‐ No, no, I love it.

995
00:44:08,297 --> 00:44:11,030
‐ Thank you for bringing me.
‐ 'Ball two.'

996
00:44:11,064 --> 00:44:12,664
You looked like
you were having fun.

997
00:44:12,697 --> 00:44:13,897
I was.

998
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:16,597
That's good.
That's really good

999
00:44:19,964 --> 00:44:22,030
‐ 'Foul ball!'
‐ 'It's a foul ball! '

1000
00:44:22,064 --> 00:44:23,230
That's a foul ball!
That's a foul ball.

1001
00:44:23,264 --> 00:44:24,564
‐ I know.
‐ 'It's a foul ball.'

1002
00:44:24,597 --> 00:44:25,830
I don't think
he knows that.

1003
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:29,864
Run, Luka. Run!
