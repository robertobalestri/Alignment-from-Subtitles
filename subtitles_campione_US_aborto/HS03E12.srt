00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,430
Com how can I help you this beautiful morning ?

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,630
You got any cases ?

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,080
Three. 

4
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:10,970
I got a teenage,african-americanlung transplant

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,470
next few days you'll be doing nothing but clinic work. 

6
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:15,640
- I just said...
- you're lying ! 

7
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:17,620
Then why'd you ask ?

8
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:21,650
Because if you told the truth,I was only gonna 
give you one day of clinic duty. 

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,020
That's dishonest. 

10
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,000
- I refuse to participate in this 
- you'll do it. 

11
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,580
You owe me. I kept you out of jail. 

12
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,530
I can put you back. 

13
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,340
Perjurer. 

14
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,830
Felon. 

15
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,920
How can I help youthis beautiful morning ?

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,800
I told the nurseI have a runny nose,but I don't. 

17
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,330
I-I think I have,uh. 

18
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,400
syphilis or gonorrhea. 

19
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,110
I think I have an std. 

20
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,780
I think I have A. 

21
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,300
who is here for a runny nose ?

22
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,570
It's a cold ! 

23
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,800
It'll get better. Go home. 

24
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,270
Those of you who have 
stayedobviously do not have colds. 

25
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,420
You will be assigned a doctor who is not me,

26
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,550
'cause I'm tired of wiping crotches. 

27
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,890
House ! 

28
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,290
You're doing this. 

29
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,770
Call security. 

30
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,960
Should I get a sedative ?

31
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,470
No,I'm good. Thanks. 

32
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,120
My head hurts ! 

33
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,560
need a team here ! 

34
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:10,920
I have the sedative. 

35
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:11,870
A little late. 

36
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,850
Just in time. 

37
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,490
- What did you give him ? 
- paralytic. 

38
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,620
why would you do that ?

39
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,120
Somebody had to stop the screaming. 

40
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,690
Then he's still in pain. 

41
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,850
Yeah,but quietly. 

42
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,560
The paralytic stopped his breathing. 

43
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:25,140
If he goes hypoxic,
he's gonna be quiet forever. 

44
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:35,940
So either I can continueto swab people's privates 
or I can figure outif this guy's delirium,pain,

45
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:41,330
and insanely high heart rate are life-threatening 
or just a personality quirk. 

46
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,290
I think the latter choiceis better for all three of us.

50
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,010
he's sedated. 

51
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:23,000
It took 5ccs of haloperidol to get him down 
after the paralytic wore off. 

52
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:27,220
so,the pain in his right ear, 
psychotic behavior,and dizziness. 

53
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,020
Go ! 

54
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,290
Nurses said he was smacking his head. 

55
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,380
How do you know it was specifically his ear ?

56
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,780
Because he was dizzy. 

57
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,700
It means the problem was affecting his inner ear. 

58
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,970
Nurses said he was running in circles. 
Doesn't mean he was dizzy. 

59
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,010
He wasn't running in circles. 

60
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,620
He was running in oblongs. 

61
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,770
Looked like a 3-year-old kid drew them. 

62
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,950
Acoustic neuroma that started to hemorrhage. 

63
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,620
Explains the pain,vertigo,everything. 

64
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,110
Get an mri. 

65
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,670
What else ?

66
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,940
- If it explains everything 
- might not explain everything. 

67
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,740
well,what if he was psychotic first,

68
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,010
then self-mutilated,damaged the ear. 

69
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,980
Excellent. 

70
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,040
We need a complete psychiatric workup. 

71
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,740
Your turn. 

72
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,990
Uh,I was gonna say what Foreman. 

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,120
well,say something else. 

74
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,760
He came to the clinic. 

75
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,830
Good. 

76
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,200
Decent chance he had a chronic illness first,
especially given the rapid heart rate. 

77
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,000
Lingering ear infection. Pressure 
builds up in his inner ear

78
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:24,490
and bursts through the mastoid bone while 
he's waiting in the clinic. 

79
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:25,900
Yes. 

80
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,460
Get a head ct,draw blood cultures,run a chem panel,

81
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:30,320
and get a complete blood count. 

82
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,700
Oh,while you're at it,pour some alcohol into his ear

83
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,330
and take out the cockroach. 

84
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,270
He has a cockroach in his ear ?

85
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,370
He was scratching that ear right 
before the event,so I took a peek. 

86
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,840
My guess is it started biting. 

87
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,520
Nothing else wrong with him ?

88
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,100
Well,isn't that enough ?

89
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,440
It's pretty gross. 

90
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,170
So. why are we doing the tests ?

91
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,250
Well,it's either that or 
I have to keep doing clinic duty. 

92
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,570
Do the tests,or just stay out of cuddy's sight. 

93
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,030
I don't really care which. 

94
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,310
Why are you here ?

95
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,790
Because it's not a hospital. 

96
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,720
It's a jogging park. 

97
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:19,870
You're not jogging. 

98
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,150
You can't jog. 

99
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,670
I'm watching jogging. 

100
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:27,220
I sit,I watch,and I imagine. 

101
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:35,640
So what do you watch for ?

102
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,950
That guy's running in shorts. 

103
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,760
he's not running. He's trolling. 

104
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,800
You're good at this. 

105
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,340
How long are you going to stay here ?

106
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,020
The beauty of this place is 
it's the last place cuddy will look. 

107
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,390
How can I help you ?

108
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,260
The doctors gave me this. 

109
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:09,840
What doctors ?

110
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,580
At the other hospital. 

111
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,490
last month. 

112
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,920
Do you know what this says ?

113
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,680
Yes. 

114
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:29,670
The patienthas a 6-centimeter mass in the 
right lung... cancerous,inoperable. 

115
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,270
Do you understand what this means ?

116
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,820
Is it okay if I sleep here tonight ?

117
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,380
It's cold outside. 

118
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,010
What are you doing here ?

119
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,850
I thought House had a case. 

120
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,040
He doesn't. 

121
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,030
You ordered a ct on a 
patient with a bug in his ear. 

122
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,220
How'd you know I was here ?

123
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,940
Ran into Cameron in the clinic. 

124
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,710
"Ran into" ?

125
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,650
You ordered point less tests just to...

126
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,630
it wouldn't have been point less 
if you had"run into" Cameron. 

127
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,670
She got punished. 

128
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,200
She's stuck with another dying patient. 

129
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,790
Is that vicodin ?

130
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,020
Breath mint. 

131
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,120
Thought you were gonna kiss me. 

132
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,470
What happened to rehab ?

133
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,720
I got out. 

134
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,870
- it was a scam ? 
- Enough foreplay. 

135
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,960
Are you gonna kiss me or not ?

136
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,810
You are going back to the clinic. 

137
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,740
Or jail. 

138
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,790
You perjured yourselfto keep me out of jail. 
How are you gonna tell...

139
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,610
I only did that because 
I thought you were getting clean. 

140
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,600
So it's do clinic dutyor go to jail ?

141
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:43,550
Yes. 

142
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,290
And then it'll be, "finish your 
paper work "or go to jail,"

143
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,910
help with fundraisingor go to jail,

144
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,220
do your job or go to jail. 

145
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,590
I think I'd rather go to jail. 

146
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,000
You owe me. 

147
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,080
Be-yootiful. 

148
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,480
Thank you. 

149
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,010
It's dry. 

150
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,340
Who cares ?

151
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,510
It's beautiful. 

152
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,210
If my lawn were half as well 
maintained as that,

153
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,500
pigeons wouldn't have the nerve to poop on it. 

154
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,060
Good grooming is important. 

155
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,370
Was that a shot ?

156
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,190
People do judge you on your appearance. 

157
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,710
When you entered I noted your 
shirt hadn't been pressed,

158
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,050
you hadn't shaved in quite some time. 

159
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:34,080
I extrapolated you were a person for 
whom detail was not a major concern. 

160
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,010
I was worried you might apply that 
same standardin your work. 

161
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,320
Do you use to enail clippers up there ?

162
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:41,220
They're longer,so they allow me 
to better reach the upper hairs. 

163
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:44,240
I'm wearing a rumpled shirt and 
forgot to brush my hair this week. 

164
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,920
You've got athlete's foot in your nose. 

165
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,560
I'm ready to be judged. 

166
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,910
Okay. 

167
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,420
$50 to any patient who is willing to 
leave here right now. 

168
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,330
House,

169
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,150
- you can't 
- my money. 

170
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,020
I don't care. People do not...

171
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:09,170
if they'll leave for 50 bucks, 
they're not all that sick. 

172
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,460
Or they're poor and desperate, 
which is why this place is here. 

173
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,680
If they're that poor, then they'd 
rather have 50 bucks. 

174
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,790
Can I have the money ?

175
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,950
Look,it's monogrammed. 

176
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,980
He doesn't need money,ergo he's not sick. 

177
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,640
And the blood ?

178
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:24,980
Could be anybody's. 

179
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,910
The monogram's definitely his. 

180
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,590
We need to talk. 

181
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:35,300
it doesn't matter what you say,do,or threaten,

182
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,050
I will find a way out. 

183
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,310
How can we make thismore interesting for you ?

184
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,870
How can we make the sky green ?

185
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,270
How can we make the tall short ?

186
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,790
You cannot make the uninteresting interesting. 

187
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,270
I'll pay you $10 for every patient 
you diagnose without touching. 

188
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,670
You pay me $10 for every one you have to touch. 

189
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:57,080
You're making this into a game for me. 

190
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,810
From which I can only conclude 
this isn't a game for you. 

191
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,050
No. 

192
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:05,650
Why ? You think if I deal with enough 
people I'll find some humanity ?

193
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:07,980
Yes. 

194
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,640
Why do I ha... to do thi... mysel... ?

195
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,360
I got a bum leg. 

196
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,540
Say,"ahh. 

197
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,700
Ahh. 

198
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:20,920
It feels rough. 

199
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:23,740
Yes,it's a rash. 

200
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,740
I'm gonna need morethan "rough. "

201
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,470
It... it's just rough. 

202
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,210
Can't you feel it ?

203
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:34,090
I could,but then what satisfaction
would you get ?

204
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,590
Got it. 

205
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,240
Start counting. 

206
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,240
How many ?

207
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,900
26. 

208
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,520
20. 

209
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:48,770
okay. 

210
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:52,920
either you suck at math or 
you're gonna die in two seconds. 

211
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:57,130
You suck amath. 

212
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,490
Diagnosis. 

213
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,260
Prescription. 

214
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,370
You owe me 30. 

215
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,080
I owe you ten. 

216
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,240
Test results are back
for your std patients. 

217
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,890
And I'm not paying you for them. 

218
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,480
You already touched them. 

219
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,220
How old are you ?

220
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,300
30. 

221
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,320
And you've never seen an afterschool 
special,dawson's creek ?

222
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,690
How do you get to 30 and not 
know about condoms ?

223
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,260
Oh,god,I... I have an std. 

224
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,390
No,but you will. 

225
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,590
Every patient who comes in here for an 
std test has one thing in common:

226
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,450
They had sws. 

227
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,590
sex whe stupid. 

228
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,080
How old are you ?

229
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,600
60. 

230
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,260
You're lying. 

231
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,540
But that's not the point. 

232
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,610
You've never seen dawson's creek ?

233
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,200
And you've never seen an afterschool special ?

234
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:10,060
How do you live to your 
age and not know about condoms ?

235
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,040
I have an std ?

236
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,500
You're actually the first one today. 

237
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,060
Lucky day. 

238
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,000
Well,not for you. 

239
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,140
But you ought a feel good for everyone else. 

240
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,620
It's chlamydia. 

241
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:30,070
As bad news goes,it's about the best. 

242
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,170
Oh,settle down. 

243
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,860
It's treatable. 

244
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,620
It's actually curable. 

245
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,140
All you gotta dois take these pilllls...

246
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,800
don'touch me ! 

247
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:53,640
Oh,god. 

248
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,780
I need someone to cover a patient. 

249
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,210
House,you committed to...

250
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,680
she was raped. 

251
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,120
You think I'm the right doctor for her ?

252
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,790
we've assigned another doctor to your care. 

253
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,120
I didn't mean to upset Dr. House. 

254
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,180
He knows that. 

255
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,350
That's not why we're doing this. 

256
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,320
I'd like to keep being treated by him. 

257
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,880
- Why ? 
- Just do. 

258
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,660
Well,trust me,it's better if you deal 
with somebody who specializes in...

259
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,940
I'm fine. 

260
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:34,290
You told Dr. House it's been less than a week. 

261
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,910
You haven't told anyone other than him. 

262
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,750
- Emotionally,you're still 
- you know what I'm dealing with ?

263
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,350
You know what I'm going through ?

264
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,370
No. 

265
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:48,000
You think Dr. House does ?

266
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:53,080
I'm not suggesting either one of us be your doctor. 

267
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,510
Dr. Stoneis a psychiatrist. 

268
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,910
If Dr. House is too busy,I could wait. 

269
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,810
Why do you want me ?

270
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,640
I don't know. 

271
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:17,180
I don't want to treat you. 

272
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,430
You're just saying that so I'll see the psychiatrist. 

273
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,790
True,except for the word "just. "

274
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,020
I'm saying I don't want see you so
you'll see the psychiatrist

275
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,950
and because I don't want to treat you. 

276
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,790
Why don't you want to treat me anymore ?

277
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,820
I never wanted to treat you. 

278
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,930
The fact that you were raped. 

279
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,060
holds no interest for me. 

280
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,960
It's nothing personal. 

281
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,440
There's nothing to treat. 

282
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:46,950
You're physically healthy. 

283
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,170
Okay. 

284
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,900
But I want you to be my doctor. 

285
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,630
Why ?

286
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,620
I don't know. 

287
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,840
Well,you've gotta have a reason. 

288
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,730
Everything has a reason. 

289
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,410
I trust you. 

290
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,910
Now,you see,that's a bad reason. 

291
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,570
See,I'll lie to you. 

292
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,440
I'll tell you anything just 
to get you out of here. 

293
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,100
I don't care. 

294
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,470
I want to talk to you. 

295
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,290
Look. you were raped. 

296
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,900
Now,all control was taken away from you, 
and you're trying to find that control again. 

297
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:31,750
You want me because I don't want you. 

298
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:36,190
I'm raping you ?

299
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,480
In a very non... invasive,more annoying...

300
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,180
get the hell out of here ! 

301
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,830
I'll send in dr. Stone. 

302
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,960
I didn't consent to all this medicine. 

303
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,240
You've been out on the streets. 

304
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,810
- No treatment
- I'm dying. 

305
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,780
There's no treatment for dying. 

306
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,600
We can make you comfortable. 

307
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,720
- Don't wanna be.  
- Why not ?

308
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,870
Because I screwed up my life. 

309
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,090
So you want to punish yourself 
for messing up your life ?

310
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,130
Please. 

311
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,380
stop the treatment. 

312
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,390
It'll go away on it's own. 

313
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,700
It's not. 
Can't you...

314
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,240
Nope. It'll go away. 

315
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,460
It's been all day. 

316
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:26,100
There must be some treatment you can...

317
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,010
nope.  It'll go away. 

318
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,710
Or it won't go away. 

319
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,210
I read about a treatment. 

320
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,680
Some doctor won a prize for it. 

321
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,620
I read about it. 

322
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,650
You don't have the hiccups,do you ?

323
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,160
Make a note. 

324
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,860
Drug-seeking behavior. 

325
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,910
- Morphine ? 
- No. 

326
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,330
Anal digital stimulation. 

327
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,350
How long has stone been in with her ?

328
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,240
Are you concerned ?

329
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,520
You know how many people
get raped every day ?

330
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,890
So it's common,therefore boring ?

331
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,040
If I were to care about every 
person suffering on the planet,

332
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,270
life would shut down. 

333
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,120
How about just the ones we meet ?

334
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,060
They deserve our sympathy more 
than the other people ?

335
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:15,030
So your solution is not to give a 
damn about any of them ?

336
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,680
How do you do that ?

337
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:19,750
How do you take that theory 
and put it in practice ?

338
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,120
You met her

339
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,270
I paid these people 50 bucks 
to leave here an hour ago. 

340
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,690
Yeah,we came back. 

341
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,180
Well,then,you owe me 50. 

342
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,780
The kid needs surgery. 

343
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:36,150
and he could walk way back then. 

344
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,840
Stand up,kid. 

345
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,080
He swallowed a magnet. 

346
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:41,030
We gotta cut it out. 

347
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,900
How old are you ?

348
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,270
8. 

349
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,980
And he swallowed something stuck to a fridge. 

350
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,790
Darwin says let him die. 

351
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,260
It's already below the stomach.  
It should pass on its own. 

352
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,570
Strong magnet. 

353
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:54,430
It's messin'with the imaging.  
We have no way to...

354
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,510
you got x-ray vision,House ?

355
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,920
Oh,you gonna cut him open ?

356
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,630
Right here ?

357
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,810
It's well into the intestines. 

358
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,210
He's fine. 

359
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,660
I want my 50 back. 

360
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,540
need a crash cart,stat. 

361
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,060
What happened ?

362
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,170
pills... benzos. 

363
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,390
We need to get her stomach pumped. 

364
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,490
Respiration's shallow. 

365
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,000
What did you say to her ?

366
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:41,250
- Nothing that would make her want to 
- heartbeat's irregular. 

367
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,310
What did she say to you ?

368
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,520
Nothing. I gave her a couple of 
sedatives,turned around,

369
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:45,540
she grabbed the whole bottle. 

370
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,680
You must have said something. 

371
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:47,940
I said plenty. 

372
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:48,930
She said nothing. 

373
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,230
I was with her for over an hour. 

374
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,180
She didn't say one word. 

375
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,320
Are you gonna do that again ?

376
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:28,760
You're gonna be okay. Physically. 

377
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,470
Which is all that interests you. 

378
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,640
But you're here. 

379
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,340
Under orders. 

380
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,530
Why would you tell me that ?

381
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,470
Because I don't like hypocrisy. 

382
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,200
But you don't have a problem with cruelty ?

383
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,990
Which brings usback to. 

384
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,990
why do you want me ?

385
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,560
I don't know. 

386
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,670
You tried to kill yourself, 
because you couldn't talk to me. 

387
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,720
You must have a reason. 

388
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,490
Why does there always have to be a reason ?

389
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,850
Can't we just talk ?

390
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,010
There's a phone. 

391
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,830
Talk to a friend,a family member. 

392
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,610
Call the police. 

393
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,800
Do you want to talk 
about what happened to you ?

394
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,120
No. 

395
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,620
Do you want to talk 
about your std meds ?

396
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,100
No. 

397
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,310
You don't really seem to want to talk. 

398
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,420
No,I do. 

399
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,530
About what ?

400
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,600
I don't know. 

401
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,580
Anything. 

402
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:40,360
The weather ?

403
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:45,960
You were raped,and you want 
to talk about the weather ?

404
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:48,210
Yeah. 

405
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,280
I'm not gonna talk to you about the weather. 

406
00:20:58,940 --> 00:20:59,940
You help her. 

407
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,050
She wants you. 

408
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,540
God knows why. 

409
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,600
She doesn't know what she wants. 

410
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:04,390
She knows she wants you. 

411
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,460
You're the first person 
she spoke to about this. 

412
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,480
The fact that I was in the 
wrong place at the wrong time

413
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:10,830
should be trumped by the fact
that I'm useless at this. 

414
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,750
No,you're not. 

415
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,920
you romantically wanting to believe 
that is never gonna make it true. 

416
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,840
I'm agreeing with you. 

417
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:23,530
You are the last person 
she should be talking to. 

418
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,170
If she wants to talk about the weather,
talk about the weather. 

419
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,230
She wants normalcy. 

420
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,260
She wants to feel like the world didn't end. 

421
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,120
Right. 

422
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:32,380
I'll tell her that everything 
went on without her:

423
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,680
Babies were born,people got married. 

424
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:36,490
Thousands of people will remember the day

425
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,210
she got raped as the happiest 
day of their lives. 

426
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,520
You might not want 
to phrase it quite that way. 

427
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:42,150
You need to get her
to talk about what happened. 

428
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,260
no,he doesn't. 

429
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,040
Pretending it didn't happen...

430
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:47,110
Wrong. Pretending this didn't happen 
is the best thing she could possibly do. 

431
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,220
She's gotta make this real. 

432
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:51,070
You know what we should be trying 
to make real or process ?

433
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,660
The few decent moments in 
our lives,not the crap. 

434
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:56,960
Maybe you're right,except there's no way 
she can pretend this didn't happen. 

435
00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:00,200
So she has no choice but to process it. 

436
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,800
You've got to tell me what happened. 

437
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:07,510
You don't really want to hear. 

438
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,960
- Sure i do.  
- You're lying. 

439
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,800
This doesn't have to destroy your life. 

440
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:17,440
I know. 

441
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,600
It doesn't mean anything about you. 

442
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,400
It wasn't your fault. 

443
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:22,370
I know. 

444
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,050
You did nothing wrong. 

445
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,020
Some jerk hurt you. That's all. 

446
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,560
I know. 

447
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:30,330
You're worried that you can 
never trust men again. 

448
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:31,080
No. 

449
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,210
Statistically,there was always 
a chance this could happen. 

450
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,710
The fact that it did happen 
doesn't change anything. 

451
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,630
The world doesn't suck any more 
today than it did yesterday. 

452
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,030
I know all that. 

453
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,660
Well,what do you want me to tell you ?

454
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:43,390
Nothing. 

455
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:45,220
I just wanna talk. 

456
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:47,100
About nothing. 

457
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:49,780
If we talk about nothing,
nothing will change. 

458
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:52,590
- It might.  
- How ?

459
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,340
Time. 

460
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:59,000
Time changes everything. 

461
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,680
That's what people say. 

462
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:01,930
It's not true. 

463
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,660
Doing things changes things. 

464
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,920
Not doing things...

465
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,860
leaves things exactlyas they were. 

466
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,280
Why do you have to suffer ?

467
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:20,680
I gave my word. 

468
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,590
Who would make you promise that ?

469
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,420
My father. 

470
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:29,060
He said I would die alone and miserable. 

471
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:31,890
That's not a promise,
and even if it was,he's dead. 

472
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,000
And even if he's not,he's not going to care. 

473
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:36,980
Why did your husband have to suffer ?

474
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:38,800
How do you know about my husband ?

475
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,590
Well,I just know. 

476
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:50,690
You have to die in pain because of 
a promise you made to your father ?

477
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:56,720
If I'd say yes,you'd use 
that as proof that I'm insane. 

478
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,840
Force treatment on me. 

479
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,660
Did the nurse tell you about my husband ?

480
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,440
No. 

481
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,960
- Nurse ? 
- Yes. 

482
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:13,640
It's under control. 

483
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:20,190
I'm sorry. 

484
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,880
I was just trying to freak you out. 

485
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:23,820
Why ?

486
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:26,650
Because I need you to remember me. 

487
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:29,760
I need somebody to remember me. 

488
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,920
Where'd you go to college ?

489
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:37,650
North western. 

490
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,220
- You ? 
- Hopkins. 

491
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,880
What was your major ?

492
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:43,180
Comparative religion. 

493
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,530
Why do you trust me ?

494
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,400
I don't know. 

495
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,290
- Can't we just... 
- that's not rational ! 

496
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,250
Nothing's rational. 

497
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,640
Everything is rational. 

498
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,080
I was raped. 

499
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,630
Explain how that makes sense to you. 

500
00:24:56,550 --> 00:25:01,200
We are selfish,base animals 
crawling across the earth. 

501
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,980
But because we've got brains,
if we try real hard,

502
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:07,910
we can occasionally aspire to something 
that is less than pure evil. 

503
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:17,430
Has anything terrible ever happened to you ?

504
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,580
What do you want me to say ?

505
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,880
You wanted this conversation. 

506
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:29,050
You wanted to talk about something that matters. 

507
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,110
Talk. 

508
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:38,390
She's waiting for your answer ?

509
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,570
She's asleep. 

510
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,470
I sedated her. 

511
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:45,610
Why do you care what you say to her ?

512
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:48,820
Because I don't know how 
to answer these questions. 

513
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:51,600
It's a simple question:
Has your life sucked ?

514
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:52,570
Tell her the truth. 

515
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,670
Tell her you were shot. 

516
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:55,640
She doesn't want to hear the truth. 

517
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:58,380
She's looking for something,
looking to extrapolate some...

518
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,010
she's looking to connect with you. 

519
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,480
And that's what's scaring the hell out of you. 

520
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:03,350
Tell her the truth. 

521
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,460
There is no truth. 

522
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:08,770
Are we role-playing ?

523
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,080
Am I you ?I don't want be you. 

524
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,150
She's not asking for test results. 

525
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:14,210
She's not asking what 2 plus 2 equals. 

526
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,320
She's asking for my personal life experience

527
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,160
so she can extrapolate to all humanity. 

528
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,040
That's not truth. 

529
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:21,100
That's bad science. 

530
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:24,260
It's not science at all. 

531
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,620
Tell her the truth. 

532
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:31,030
Tell her your lifehas been good. 

533
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,150
It hasn't been. 

534
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,260
Tell her anyway. 

535
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,120
She wants hope. 

536
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:37,410
She wants to know that what happened 
to her wasn't the norm,

537
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:41,410
that things can be okay,which means 
maybe they canbe okay for her again. 

538
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:46,010
Tell her your life sucked. 

539
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,070
It didn't. 

540
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,420
Tell her anyway. 

541
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,810
She wants to know she's not alone. 

542
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,490
She wants to know she's gonna survive this,

543
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,990
that other people have beenthrough this 
and worse and come out the other end. 

544
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,390
She wants to know she's going to heal. 

545
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,600
Act like... you're healed. 

546
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:09,300
Tell her... keep her asleep. 

547
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:13,210
Thanks. You've all been a huge help. 

548
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:18,070
There's no wrong answer,
because there's no right answer. 

549
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,140
Wrong. 

550
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:23,160
We just don't know what the right answer is. 

551
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,910
Wake up. 

552
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:42,260
It's not as bad as 
what happened to you,I don't think. 

553
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,890
I don't know what happened to you. 

554
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,460
But given how lousy you're responding,

555
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:49,200
I assume it was worse than getting 
abused by your grandmother. 

556
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:54,560
What did she do to you ?

557
00:27:56,430 --> 00:28:00,210
My parents traveled a lot,
and they'd leave me with her. 

558
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,420
She liked things the way she liked them. 

559
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:05,630
And she believed in discipline. 

560
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:06,750
She was right,I suppose,because

561
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,010
I hardly ever screwed up when she was around. 

562
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:16,430
Too scared of being forced to sleep 
in the yard or take a bath in ice. 

563
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:22,460
Your turn. 

564
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:28,500
Your parents,they... they never stopped her ?

565
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:30,280
I never told them. 

566
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:32,100
Why not ?

567
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:34,830
Usual reasons: I was afraid 
they wouldn't believe me,

568
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,430
and I was afraid they'd think 
I'd done something wrong. 

569
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,980
I opened up to you,you open up to me. 

570
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:47,600
- What did you call her ? 
- Oma. 

571
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:49,760
And you kept calling her that after this ?

572
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:51,250
Dutch for "grandmother. 

573
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:55,370
" She was still my grandmother,
and she was still dutch. 

574
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:03,460
Is any part of that story true ?

575
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:05,090
All of it. 

576
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:07,390
You wouldn't keep calling her oma. 

577
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:09,260
Something would have to change. 

578
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,910
- You don't know me.  
- You wouldn't keepcalling her oma. 

579
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,020
Look,you're overreacting. 

580
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,460
Do not dismiss me. 

581
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,330
I'm not dismissing you. 

582
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,100
I'm just saying you're not acting rationally. 

583
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:20,020
I'm angry because you are lying to me. 

584
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,950
No. You are...

585
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,770
What can I do ?

586
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,780
What the hell can I do that 
you're not gonna dismiss

587
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:26,810
as just being 
because I was raped ?

588
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:33,040
Nothing. 

589
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,450
Your story... is it true ?

590
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:43,030
True for somebody. 

591
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,820
But not for you. 

592
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,880
These things happen. 

593
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:48,710
It happened to somebody. 

594
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,540
What do you care if it happened to me ?

595
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,000
They're not in this room. 

596
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:55,940
No ! They're out there : 
Doctors,lawyers... postal workers. 

597
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:56,980
Some of them doing great. 

598
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:58,380
Some of them doing lousy. 

599
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:01,740
Are you gonna base your whole life on 
who you got stuck in a room with ?

600
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:05,960
I'm gonna base this moment 
on who I'm stuck in a room with. 

601
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:07,920
That's what life is. 

602
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,090
It's a series of rooms. 

603
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:16,110
And who we get stuck in those rooms 
with adds up to what are lives are. 

604
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:23,550
House. 

605
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,770
You've gotto get me out of this. 

606
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,970
There's nothing to diagnose. 

607
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,790
- There's nothing... 
- You only tested her for stds ?

608
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,380
I had seven morons who 
forgot their raincoats. 

609
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:48,850
It's all they asked for,
so I didn't waste the lab's time. Why ?

610
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,770
I wasted their time. 

611
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:53,070
She's pregnant. 

612
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:07,260
Do you understand ?

613
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,710
Are you okay ?

614
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:16,510
I mean,I know you're not okay,
but are you moreor

615
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:20,250
less not okay than you were five minutes ago ?

616
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:23,030
About the same. 

617
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:25,000
Good. 

618
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,250
The termination procedure isn't pleasant. 

619
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,650
I don't want to terminate. 

620
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,520
You want to keep the baby ?

621
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:35,010
Abortion is murder. 

622
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:40,090
True. It's a life,and...

623
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,440
you should end it. 

624
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,360
Every life is sacred. 

625
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:48,560
Come on. Talk to me. 
Don't quote me bumper stickers. 

626
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:50,300
- It's true.  
- It's meaningless. 

627
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,980
It means every life matters to god. 

628
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:54,170
Not to me,not to you. 

629
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,950
Judging by the number of natural 
disasters,not to god either. 

630
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,250
You're just being argumentative. 

631
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,820
Yeah ! I do do that. 

632
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:02,110
What about Hitler ?

633
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:03,870
Was his life sacred to god ?

634
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,600
Father of your child,is his life sacred to you ?

635
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,600
My child isn't Hitler. 

636
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:10,210
Either every life is sacred,or it...

637
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:13,520
Stop it ! I don't wanna chat about philosophy. 

638
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:17,660
You're not killing your rape 
baby because of a philosophy. 

639
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:21,950
It's murder. I'm against it. You for it ?

640
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:24,020
Not as a general rule. 

641
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,270
Just for unborn children ?

642
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,950
Yes. 

643
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:34,670
The problem with exceptions 
to rules is the line-drawing. 

644
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,830
It might make sense for us to kill 
the ass that did this to you. 

645
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:39,510
I mean,where do we draw the line ?

646
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:43,690
Which asses do we get to kill,and which 
asses get to keep on being asses ?

647
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:45,700
The nice thing about the abortion debate is

648
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:48,100
that we can quibble over 
trimesters,but ultimately,

649
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:53,230
there's a nice,clean line: Birth. 

650
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:58,650
Morally there isn't a lot 
of difference. Practically,huge. 

651
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,210
You're enjoying this conversation. 

652
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:07,290
This is the type of conversation I do well. 

653
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:11,650
But the other type...

654
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:17,160
the personal stuff ?

655
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,320
There are no answers. 

656
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:24,490
If there are no answers,why talk about it ?

657
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,760
You're healthy. 

658
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:32,740
You shouldn't here. 

659
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:36,860
I don't want to go. 

660
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:42,850
Fine. I won't discharge you. 

661
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:50,990
You wanna go for a walk ?

662
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,100
This is the last of my journey. 

663
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,040
You don't deserve pain. 

664
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,810
- You're just an insane old man.  
- No,no. 

665
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:04,040
I'm not gonna watch you suffer. 

666
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:05,770
I need you to remember me. 

667
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,460
I'll remember you ! 

668
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,040
Why ?

669
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,760
Because you're a nice man. 

670
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:11,030
You don'know that. 

671
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,670
You don't know anything about me. 

672
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,500
Either you are a nice manor you're an ass. 

673
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:17,900
Either way,you did something to somebody 
that they're gonna remember. 

674
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,250
I have no family. 

675
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,640
I have no friends. 

676
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:23,420
I didn't even have a real job. 

677
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,240
If I die in peace,
then I'm just another patient. 

678
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,810
- But if I die suffering...
- it'll be horrible. 

679
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:32,260
Don't do that to either of us. 

680
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:39,900
No,I just need to die knowing that something 
is different because I was here. 

681
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:49,140
Oh...Oh,no. 

682
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:22,450
Life goes on. 

683
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,400
Is that the reason why we're out here ?

684
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:28,300
You know why I come here ?

685
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:32,140
I sit,I watch,I imagine. 

686
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:36,260
Sounds nice. 

687
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:39,280
I imagine that one of them will break a leg. 

688
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:43,880
Just one false step,one crack in the side walk. 

689
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:45,800
You don't really. 

690
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:47,430
I'm evil. 

691
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,880
Evil people don't say they're evil. 

692
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:52,560
That sounds like an easy loophole. 

693
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,260
People can do good things. 

694
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:59,700
But if their instincts are not good,

695
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:04,540
either god doesn't exist 
or he's unimaginably cruel. 

696
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,620
I don't believe that. 

697
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:09,730
So what do you believe ?

698
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:12,800
Why do you think this happened ?

699
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,720
I don't want to talk about it. 

700
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:17,740
Me neither. 

701
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:19,850
Too bad. 

702
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:24,110
You know,I don't think there was a reason. 

703
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:27,180
Uh-huh,so god does exist,lets you get raped,

704
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:30,540
and needs you to keep your rape baby for no reason. 

705
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:35,590
Well,maybe he was challenging me. 

706
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,920
He hurts you to help you. 

707
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:41,280
I guess it's better than because he hates you. 

708
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,100
You're trying to convince me there's no god. 

709
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,840
Why would you even say something like that ?

710
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,420
Because you're throwing your life away. 

711
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,010
I'm doing what I believe. 

712
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,360
What you believe doesn't make sense. 

713
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,660
This is not helping me. 

714
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:56,110
Then I can't help you. 

715
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:01,810
If you believe in eternity,
then life is irrelevant. 

716
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:06,600
The same as a bugis irrelevant 
in comparison to the universe. 

717
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,640
If you don't believe in eternity,
then what you do here is irrelevant. 

718
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:17,230
Your actions here are all that matters. 

719
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,720
Then nothing matters. 

720
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:21,790
There's noultimate consequences. 

721
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,670
I couldn't live like that. 

722
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:32,180
So you need to think that the guy
who did this to you is gonna be punished. 

723
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:35,950
I need to know that it all means something. 

724
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:39,300
I need that comfort. 

725
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:43,030
Yeah. Are you feeling comfortable ?

726
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:47,350
You feeling good right now,feel warm inside ?

727
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,130
I was raped. 

728
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,430
What's your excuse ?

729
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:02,200
Do you think the guy who did this to me feels bad ?

730
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,830
That'd help you ?

731
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:07,710
It'll make you feel better ?

732
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,200
Why do you always do that...

733
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:13,420
ask why I'm asking questions instead 
of just answering the question ?

734
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,340
Because the answer doesn't interest me. 

735
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,880
I don't care what he's feeling. 

736
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:20,590
I'm interested in what you're feeling. 

737
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:25,550
You are ?

738
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:31,540
I'm trapped in the room with you,right ?

739
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,810
Why did you choose me ?

740
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,050
There's something about you. 

741
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:48,220
It's like you're hurt too. 

742
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:02,430
It was true. 

743
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,700
What was ?

744
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:11,440
It wasn't my grandmother,but it was true. 

745
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:17,190
Who was it ?

746
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:21,690
It was my dad. 

747
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:43,140
I'd like to tell you what happened to me now. 

748
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,790
I'd like to hear it. 

749
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:05,890
It was my friends' birthday party

750
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:51,890
she terminated. 

751
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,360
She's been discharged. 

752
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:58,140
She's gonna be okay. 

753
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:01,300
Yeah. It's that simple. 

754
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,940
She's talking about what happened. 

755
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:07,950
That's huge. You did good. 

756
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,650
And everyone'll tell you that's what we gotta

757
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:14,030
make her do if we're gonna help her,right ?

758
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,190
Except we can't. 

759
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:23,090
We drag out her story,tell each other 
that it'll help her heal,

760
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:26,110
and feel real good about ourselves. 

761
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:31,220
But maybe all we've done is make a girl cry. 

762
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:33,270
Then why did you...

763
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:40,360
Because I don't know. 

764
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,270
you gonna follow up with her ?

765
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,900
One day. One room. 

766
