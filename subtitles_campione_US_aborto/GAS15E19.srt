a poisonous snake</i>

<i>in our path,
we freeze</i>

3
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,897
<i>When we smell smoke, we run.</i>

00:00:09,114 --> 00:00:13,067
<i>When faced with danger,
fear takes over, and we react,</i>

5
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:14,638

6
00:00:14,724 --> 00:00:15,747
<i>Jo!</i>

7
00:00:15,889 --> 00:00:17,646
You left
while I was in the shower.

8
00:00:17,853 --> 00:00:19,600
- What, are you avoiding me?
- Yes.

9
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,247
Wait, not on purpose,
no.

10
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:22,560
Sorry. Hi.
I just...

11
00:00:22,646 --> 00:00:24,568
Bailey's back
to being chief tomorrow,

12
00:00:24,653 --> 00:00:26,381
so I have one last shot
at her full attention

13
00:00:26,466 --> 00:00:27,795
about a new grant
for my fellowship,

14
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,834
and I just... I figured that
you would want to sleep in.

15
00:00:29,919 --> 00:00:31,724
- Yeah, but I was in the shower.
- Right.

16
00:00:31,856 --> 00:00:33,364
Jo, it's me.

17
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,271
How long are we gonna
do this?

18
00:00:35,622 --> 00:00:37,381
Whatever happened with your
birth mom, you can tell me.

19
00:00:37,466 --> 00:00:38,646
Do you know
what the funding limits are

20
00:00:38,731 --> 00:00:40,708
on R90 or R15 grant?

21
00:00:40,854 --> 00:00:42,364
No. Jo...

22
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,614
Okay, I got to figure that out
before Bailey gets here.

23
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,700
I'm... sorry.

24
00:00:45,786 --> 00:00:48,373
<i> It's biological... primal.</i>

25
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:52,149
<i>But for someone
who suffers from trauma,</i>

26
00:00:52,811 --> 00:00:54,743
<i>it's the everyday things...</i>

27
00:00:55,135 --> 00:00:56,907
<i>a song in a coffee shop,</i>

28
00:00:57,063 --> 00:00:58,920
<i>the smell of rubbing alcohol..</i>

29
00:01:00,068 --> 00:01:03,196
<i>...seemingly random,
common things</i>

30
00:01:03,428 --> 00:01:06,454
<i>convincing your brain and body
you're in danger...</i>

31
00:01:07,814 --> 00:01:09,635
<i>...and there is no way out.</i>

32
00:01:17,724 --> 00:01:19,455
Hi.
What can I do for you?

33
00:01:22,227 --> 00:01:23,885
I'm Dr. Karev.

34
00:01:24,297 --> 00:01:25,986
Josephine. Jo.

35
00:01:26,072 --> 00:01:27,072
Um...

36
00:01:27,158 --> 00:01:28,791
 Mom,
I can't find my shoes!

37
00:01:28,877 --> 00:01:30,644
 <i>They're in the kitchen,
and they smell!</i>

38
00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:31,744
<i>Who ate all the cereal?</i>

39
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,283
Honey, there's more
in the pantry. Y...

40
00:01:36,111 --> 00:01:39,119
Well, apparently, my kids forgot
that they were old enough

41
00:01:39,205 --> 00:01:41,557
to feed and
clothe themselves today.

42
00:01:41,677 --> 00:01:43,111
You have kids.

43
00:01:43,682 --> 00:01:47,268
Um, listen, if you're...
if you're selling magazines or...

44
00:01:47,353 --> 00:01:49,270
or religion,
we're good on both, so...

45
00:01:49,355 --> 00:01:50,424
But thank you so much.

46
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,328
No, no. E-Emerson Hospital.

47
00:01:52,892 --> 00:01:54,274
Oh, right, okay.

48
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:55,853
Well, if you just go here,

49
00:01:55,939 --> 00:01:57,103
- and you take Willowbrook...
- No, no, I-I was...

50
00:01:57,182 --> 00:01:59,662
- ...and then you're gonna...
- I was born at Emerson Hospital,

51
00:02:00,734 --> 00:02:04,791
and soon after, I was left at
the fire station on 47th Street.

52
00:02:04,948 --> 00:02:07,307
I think that you're the person
who left me.

53
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,478
I think
you're my mother.

You have
your chemistry report?

57
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,020
It's a paper, Mom.

58
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,572
Yeah, as long as it's done,

59
00:02:28,658 --> 00:02:30,311
you can call it
whatever you like.

60
00:02:30,396 --> 00:02:33,072
Hey, um, I'm thinking about
Cal's Burgers tonight.

61
00:02:33,158 --> 00:02:34,526
Celebrate your
last day of sabbatical.

62
00:02:34,611 --> 00:02:35,791
Can't.

63
00:02:35,876 --> 00:02:37,682
I have a thing tonight.</font>

64
00:02:37,816 --> 00:02:39,033
With who?

65
00:02:39,477 --> 00:02:41,094
With Kelly.

66
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,837
- There's a Kelly?
- Define "thing."

67
00:02:42,923 --> 00:02:45,040
We're just talking,
is all.

68
00:02:45,649 --> 00:02:47,945
So, you can't come
have burgers with us,

69
00:02:48,148 --> 00:02:50,478
because you're talking to Kelly.

70
00:02:50,776 --> 00:02:52,884
- At a <i>thing.</i>
<i>- Here's fine.</i>

71
00:02:54,558 --> 00:02:56,501
We're nowhere near the school.
What?

72
00:02:56,623 --> 00:02:57,872
It's fine.

73
00:02:59,626 --> 00:03:01,509
- Bye, love you!
- Good luck with your re...

74
00:03:01,594 --> 00:03:03,144
report!

75
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,552
It's a paper.

76
00:03:07,638 --> 00:03:09,005
I know.

77
00:03:11,735 --> 00:03:13,823
- Did he just put his arm around...
- He put his hand...

78
00:03:13,908 --> 00:03:15,556
<i>Dr. Pannell to Plastics.</i>

79
00:03:15,665 --> 00:03:17,618
<i>Dr. Pannell to Plastics.</i>

80
00:03:23,983 --> 00:03:25,892
Oh, my God!
Sorry. Sorry.

81
00:03:27,482 --> 00:03:29,504
Hey, you... you have a...
you have, um, a...

82
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:31,158
A-A crap sense of direction

83
00:03:31,243 --> 00:03:32,907
and can't find my way
to the ER.

84
00:03:33,157 --> 00:03:34,674
It's one floor down,
and then, if...

85
00:03:36,863 --> 00:03:38,735
You know,
why don't I take you?

86
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,290
You ever have just a garbage
sort of day?

87
00:03:43,703 --> 00:03:45,392
More times than
I can count.

88
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,110
This way.

89
00:03:51,044 --> 00:03:52,540
You'll need stitches.

90
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:55,115
I'll have a nurse bring you
a blanket.

91
00:03:55,707 --> 00:03:57,436
I feel so stupid.

92
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:00,954
I was putting away dishes
and just...

93
00:04:01,071 --> 00:04:03,071
smacked myself in the face
with the cabinet.

94
00:04:03,157 --> 00:04:04,574
Such an idiot.

95
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,924
That cut looks
pretty deep,

96
00:04:06,009 --> 00:04:08,493
so Dr. Qadri will have to numb
it before we can clean it.

97
00:04:08,684 --> 00:04:10,220
When did this happen?

98
00:04:10,337 --> 00:04:11,743
Last night.

99
00:04:12,177 --> 00:04:14,446
I thought it would be fine,
but it just keeps bleeding.

100
00:04:14,532 --> 00:04:16,360
Dr. Qadri
and I can help with that.

101
00:04:16,446 --> 00:04:18,526
I'm just gonna put a little
Betadine around the area,

102
00:04:18,972 --> 00:04:20,321
and you're just gonna feel
a little stick and a burn.

103
00:04:20,406 --> 00:04:21,729
Are you hurting anywhere else?

104
00:04:21,815 --> 00:04:23,667
Hey. Dr. Bailey's
been looking for you...

105
00:04:23,752 --> 00:04:25,815
- something about a grant deadline?
- Oh, okay.

106
00:04:25,901 --> 00:04:27,595
Um, I'm gonna be right...

107
00:04:36,812 --> 00:04:39,675
My patient here, Abby, she...

108
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:42,386
hit her face on a cabinet.

109
00:04:42,742 --> 00:04:44,127
So if you could give us
some room, please,

110
00:04:44,212 --> 00:04:45,846
so I can suture her facial lac?

111
00:04:45,932 --> 00:04:48,057
And tell Dr. Bailey
that I will be a while.

112
00:04:48,561 --> 00:04:49,842
Thank you.

113
00:04:54,751 --> 00:04:56,345
Hey, why don't you sit up, okay?

114
00:04:56,886 --> 00:04:58,112
We'll sit you up. Okay.

115
00:05:00,254 --> 00:05:01,403
Is your belly hurting?

116
00:05:01,489 --> 00:05:03,839
No, it's just the cheek.

117
00:05:04,225 --> 00:05:06,948
You can fix it now, right?
So I can go.

118
00:05:07,334 --> 00:05:11,143
Dr. Qadri, um, can you go
get me some 4-0 MONOCRYL,

119
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,409
and can we please
close those?

120
00:05:13,495 --> 00:05:14,542
Thank you.

121
00:05:21,768 --> 00:05:24,623
Abby, it's just you and me.

122
00:05:25,738 --> 00:05:27,151
You're hurt.

123
00:05:27,385 --> 00:05:29,019
I am here to help.

124
00:05:35,596 --> 00:05:37,446
- Okay.
- Okay.

125
00:05:53,299 --> 00:05:54,933
Okay. Okay.

126
00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:04,714
I got you, Abby.

127
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:07,050
I'm not going anywhere.

128
00:06:16,255 --> 00:06:17,839
Look, I don't know
what you're after,

129
00:06:17,924 --> 00:06:18,873
but you can't be here.

130
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:20,182
I'm not after anything.

131
00:06:20,268 --> 00:06:21,831
I just want to talk.

132
00:06:22,441 --> 00:06:24,158
You cannot be here.

133
00:06:24,688 --> 00:06:26,133
Chip!

134
00:06:26,366 --> 00:06:28,386
Hey, Chip. Come here.

135
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:29,717
Hey, buddy.

136
00:06:29,802 --> 00:06:32,287
I'll, uh, put him out back
and drop the kids at school.

137
00:06:32,372 --> 00:06:34,255
Is everything okay?

138
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,691
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I was just saying

139
00:06:35,776 --> 00:06:38,459
that we're already familiar
with the Book of Mormon, so...

140
00:06:38,581 --> 00:06:40,526
Ah, saw the original cast.
Loved it.

141
00:06:40,824 --> 00:06:43,909
Not a big fan of the book,
though, so... we're all set.

142
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,909
There's a diner... a few miles up.

143
00:06:57,995 --> 00:06:59,378
Weird green roof?

144
00:06:59,464 --> 00:07:00,985
Ira's?

145
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,503
One conversation.

146
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:06,053
And you will never hear
from me again.

147
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:30,399
Just one.

148
00:07:30,485 --> 00:07:31,925
Oh, right this way.

149
00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:55,831
<i>Can I get you a warm-up?</i>

150
00:08:10,105 --> 00:08:11,902
The coffee here sucks.

151
00:08:11,988 --> 00:08:13,355
I've noticed.

152
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:16,641
I'm late for work. Um...

153
00:08:20,171 --> 00:08:21,821
I work in the mayor's office.

154
00:08:21,906 --> 00:08:24,424
Try to create jobs
for under-served communities.

155
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,288
I'm sorry.
You knocked on my door.

156
00:08:29,374 --> 00:08:30,695
- I don't...
- You have a house...

157
00:08:30,804 --> 00:08:32,522
a really beautiful house.

158
00:08:32,608 --> 00:08:33,647
Thank you...?

159
00:08:33,733 --> 00:08:36,866
And kids and a husband
and a dog

160
00:08:36,952 --> 00:08:38,632
and crown frickin' moldings.

161
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:39,989
Do you need money?
If this is about money...

162
00:08:40,074 --> 00:08:41,945
I don't need your damn money.

163
00:08:45,911 --> 00:08:47,391
Thank you.

164
00:08:48,157 --> 00:08:49,552
Look, I'm not quite sure

165
00:08:49,645 --> 00:08:50,834
- what you expected...
- In my head,

166
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:53,466
you worked at
a diner half as nice as this.

167
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:55,880
And you didn't graduate high school,

168
00:08:55,966 --> 00:08:57,606
or maybe you did
but a year or two late

169
00:08:57,692 --> 00:08:59,789
'cause they don't let pregnant
girls finish high school.

170
00:08:59,874 --> 00:09:02,528
And you scraped
by somehow on...

171
00:09:02,613 --> 00:09:04,544
hard work
and the kindness of strangers,

172
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:05,832
but you had no one.

173
00:09:05,917 --> 00:09:07,364
You had nothing.

174
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,708
That would make it okay
that I left you?

175
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,920
I wanted you to have a better
life than I could give you...

176
00:09:15,005 --> 00:09:17,298
Now, <i>that</i> part
I heard in my head.

177
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:18,868
I think it came

178
00:09:18,954 --> 00:09:21,118
- from a made-for-TV movie.
- No, I-I-I realized it

179
00:09:21,204 --> 00:09:23,879
the minute it came out
of my mouth, yes, um...

180
00:09:25,782 --> 00:09:27,249
But it's true.

181
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,853
I really thought that
you'd be better off...

182
00:09:30,939 --> 00:09:32,063
What are their names?

183
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:33,954
- I'm sorry?
- Your kids.

184
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,337
My brother and sister eating
cereal in your perfect kitchen.

185
00:09:37,423 --> 00:09:38,728
What are their names?

186
00:09:38,814 --> 00:09:41,346
Alexandra is a senior in high school,

187
00:09:41,431 --> 00:09:44,134
and, uh, Josh is in 10th.

188
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:49,780
And your husband, the,
what, the... accountant?

189
00:09:49,939 --> 00:09:51,251
Lawyer.

190
00:09:51,677 --> 00:09:53,203
Is he my father?

191
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,881
No.

192
00:09:55,045 --> 00:09:57,396
No, he is nothing like... no.

193
00:09:57,481 --> 00:09:59,454
No, I met my husband in grad school.

194
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,866
Um...

195
00:10:00,951 --> 00:10:02,041
His name is Daniel.

196
00:10:02,127 --> 00:10:03,283
Daniel.

197
00:10:04,274 --> 00:10:06,001
That's nice.

198
00:10:06,688 --> 00:10:08,048
That's really nice.

199
00:10:08,165 --> 00:10:10,642
You know,
I-I... I appreciate a girl

200
00:10:10,728 --> 00:10:11,736
with fire in her belly, but...

201
00:10:11,821 --> 00:10:13,999
I didn't have a better life.

202
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,898
I wasn't better off.

203
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,978
No one found me
adoring parents

204
00:10:20,064 --> 00:10:22,728
who were dying for a newborn
of their own to love.

205
00:10:22,814 --> 00:10:24,907
I lived in foster homes
so bad,

206
00:10:24,993 --> 00:10:27,399
it was better
to live in my car.

207
00:10:27,579 --> 00:10:30,001
And when a man finally told me
that he loved me,

208
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,750
I believed him,

209
00:10:32,928 --> 00:10:36,842
even when he beat the crap out
of me so bad I couldn't see.

210
00:10:37,665 --> 00:10:40,006
So whatever life you had,

211
00:10:40,243 --> 00:10:43,170
tell me it wasn't better
than mine.

212
00:10:49,196 --> 00:10:50,514
I should go.

213
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,835
At least you're consistent.</font>

214
00:10:59,196 --> 00:11:01,368
Did you honestly come here
to punish me?

215
00:11:01,454 --> 00:11:02,345
Consider it done.

216
00:11:02,431 --> 00:11:04,455
I came because I don't know
anything about where I'm from,

217
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,431
and I want to know.

218
00:11:16,893 --> 00:11:18,482
Um...

219
00:11:19,134 --> 00:11:20,943
My, um...

220
00:11:22,298 --> 00:11:23,845
father's side is pure Irish.

221
00:11:23,931 --> 00:11:26,696
My... My... My mother
is Russian Jew and Italian.

222
00:11:26,782 --> 00:11:28,587
I got all that
from spitting in a tube.

223
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:30,337
My mother's parents...

224
00:11:30,692 --> 00:11:32,110
died when she was young...

225
00:11:32,196 --> 00:11:33,696
heart disease and cancer.

226
00:11:33,782 --> 00:11:35,360
So I'm afraid that's
in the mix.

227
00:11:35,782 --> 00:11:38,829
Uh, there's no history of
mental illness that I'm aware...

228
00:11:38,915 --> 00:11:41,751
- That's not what I'm asking.
- Then what do you want to know?

229
00:11:41,837 --> 00:11:43,946
Something I can't get
from spitting in a tube!

230
00:11:45,431 --> 00:11:46,705
Ah.

231
00:11:47,032 --> 00:11:50,274
I, um...
I grew up on a farm in Kansas.

232
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,728
My childhood is a blur of chickens

233
00:11:52,814 --> 00:11:54,774
and singing songs
out in the field

234
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,111
when I should've been
helping my mother.

235
00:11:56,196 --> 00:11:58,626
I was spelling bee champion
for four years in a row.

236
00:11:58,712 --> 00:12:00,860
I love the smell of rosemary.
I'm terrible at math.

237
00:12:00,946 --> 00:12:02,338
Does that help?
Does that help you at all?

238
00:12:02,423 --> 00:12:04,422
- Do you know who you are now?
- Forget it.

239
00:12:04,688 --> 00:12:07,392
Just tell me who my father is,
and I will try and find him.

240
00:12:07,485 --> 00:12:08,579
You can't.

241
00:12:09,407 --> 00:12:10,618
He's dead.

242
00:12:10,704 --> 00:12:11,930
Geez, lady.

243
00:12:14,439 --> 00:12:16,790
You don't want to, I don't know,
soften it a little?

244
00:12:16,876 --> 00:12:19,454
Well, I'm sorry, but that
son of a bitch who hurt me

245
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,274
more than any other
human being ever has...

246
00:12:22,495 --> 00:12:25,012
died in a motorcycle accident
10 years ago.

247
00:12:25,261 --> 00:12:26,344
Not the way that I would've hoped.

248
00:12:26,429 --> 00:12:29,157
I would've preferred that
he had been eaten by fire ants

249
00:12:29,243 --> 00:12:30,525
or pulled apart limb from limb, but...

250
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:31,985
Wow.

251
00:12:32,642 --> 00:12:34,782
You're just a monster, huh?

252
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,267
- Please sit down.
- Abandoning me wasn't enough,

253
00:12:39,376 --> 00:12:41,283
you just have to spread the pain
around a little bit?

254
00:12:41,368 --> 00:12:42,044
Sit down.

255
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:43,697
That's my father that
you're talking about.

256
00:12:43,782 --> 00:12:46,071
- No, it's not. He hurt me...
- I'm so sorry

257
00:12:46,157 --> 00:12:48,392
that your childhood sweetheart
didn't pan out.

258
00:12:48,478 --> 00:12:50,274
- So sorry.
- He hurt me.

259
00:12:55,722 --> 00:12:58,391
Please sit down, okay?

260
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,479
Please sit down.

261
00:13:13,266 --> 00:13:14,867
He was a TA...

262
00:13:17,944 --> 00:13:21,045
...when I was a freshman
in undergrad.

263
00:13:21,164 --> 00:13:24,154
He chased after me
for weeks for a date.

264
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,474
He, um,
sent me flowers and proclamations

265
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,065
until, finally, I said yes.

266
00:13:30,284 --> 00:13:33,669
I said... I said yes to that date.

267
00:13:33,754 --> 00:13:37,006
I said... yes to going...

268
00:13:37,091 --> 00:13:39,608
to Braden's Point to watch the sunset.

269
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,277
And...

270
00:13:45,515 --> 00:13:49,133
Then he started kissing me
and touching me.

271
00:13:49,219 --> 00:13:50,436
And I said no.

272
00:13:50,521 --> 00:13:52,171
And I continued to say no.

273
00:13:52,256 --> 00:13:53,539
And I fought him.

274
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:54,840
I fought as hard as I could,

275
00:13:54,925 --> 00:13:57,042
but he would not take no for an answer.

276
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,777
So...

277
00:13:58,862 --> 00:14:01,513
nine months later, I had a baby.

278
00:14:01,598 --> 00:14:04,029
I had you, and then...

279
00:14:04,735 --> 00:14:06,819
five days later, I didn't.

280
00:14:26,534 --> 00:14:27,605
Qadri, let's get her

281
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:29,401
IM Toradol for the pain

282
00:14:29,487 --> 00:14:31,042
and keep her NPO for now.

283
00:14:31,128 --> 00:14:32,824
Is there someone
that we can call?

284
00:14:32,909 --> 00:14:35,761
Family member or a friend?

285
00:14:35,847 --> 00:14:38,631
My husband's in
Portland on a business trip.

286
00:14:38,717 --> 00:14:41,293
I don't want to... bother him.

287
00:14:42,613 --> 00:14:44,535
It's okay. I called her here to help.

288
00:14:44,621 --> 00:14:45,875
- Hi.
- Hi.

289
00:14:45,961 --> 00:14:47,172
Why do I need another doctor?

290
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,595
Can't I just keep you two?</font>

291
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,211
It's Abby, right? Hi.

292
00:14:50,297 --> 00:14:53,078
Dr. Karev and Dr. Qadri
will still be your doctors,

293
00:14:53,163 --> 00:14:54,985
but would it be okay if I helped?

294
00:14:55,257 --> 00:14:58,001
May I do an ultrasound just to
check for internal injuries?

295
00:14:58,087 --> 00:14:59,870
- Okay. Great.
- All right, here we go.

296
00:15:00,002 --> 00:15:01,586
Let's lie you back.

297
00:15:01,672 --> 00:15:02,736
I got you.

298
00:15:02,822 --> 00:15:03,855
That's it, I got you.

299
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,376
Okay, you're almost there.</font>

300
00:15:05,461 --> 00:15:06,462
- Okay.
- All right.

301
00:15:06,548 --> 00:15:07,559
Okay.

302
00:15:07,644 --> 00:15:09,678
Just gonna open your robe.

303
00:15:15,604 --> 00:15:17,355
Now a little gel.

304
00:15:21,424 --> 00:15:23,634
All right, you'll feel
just a little pressure.

305
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,071
There we go. Good job.</font>

306
00:15:29,838 --> 00:15:32,822
All right, Abby, you do have
a tear in your diaphragm,

307
00:15:32,907 --> 00:15:35,618
and it's caused your abdominal organs

308
00:15:35,704 --> 00:15:37,093
to move up into your chest.

309
00:15:37,178 --> 00:15:39,129
You're gonna need a surgery.

310
00:15:39,214 --> 00:15:40,262
Fine.

311
00:15:40,347 --> 00:15:42,666
Whatever you need to do so I can go home.

312
00:15:42,751 --> 00:15:45,212
All right, Dr. Karev, can I talk
to you outside for a minute?

313
00:15:45,298 --> 00:15:48,157
- No, no, can you stay?
- I'll just be right outside.

314
00:15:48,243 --> 00:15:49,212
I won't be more than

315
00:15:49,298 --> 00:15:50,703
- a couple minutes...
- Y-You can't... You can't leave, please?

316
00:15:50,788 --> 00:15:52,782
Just do the surgery,
and then I can go home,

317
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,973
- and then it'll be over.
- All right.

318
00:15:55,059 --> 00:15:57,146
We'll let them know
to prep the OR.

319
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:01,141
Qadri, come with me. Thanks.

320
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:02,663
<i>Dr. Yates to Pediatrics.</i>

321
00:16:02,748 --> 00:16:04,915
<i>Dr. Yates to Pediatrics.</i>

322
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:08,868
Book an OR, but do not let
the nurses or anyone else

323
00:16:08,988 --> 00:16:10,657
do an antibiotic prep.

324
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:12,142
So we're not operating on her?

325
00:16:12,228 --> 00:16:13,640
Abby's wounds are consistent

326
00:16:13,726 --> 00:16:15,009
with someone who's been
sexually assaulted,

327
00:16:15,094 --> 00:16:16,196
and if that's true,

328
00:16:16,282 --> 00:16:19,095
when the nurses prep her
with an antibiotic solution,

329
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,086
evidence will be erased.

330
00:16:21,362 --> 00:16:22,481
So we wait.

331
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:24,618
We wait and give Abby the chance to talk

332
00:16:24,704 --> 00:16:27,121
without taking more of the
agency than she's already lost.

333
00:16:27,206 --> 00:16:29,409
Go book the OR
and come straight back.

334
00:16:35,281 --> 00:16:37,215
Okay.

335
00:16:39,151 --> 00:16:42,798
Hey. Are you sure there isn't
someone we can call?

336
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:46,655
Can we ask you
how you got hurt?

337
00:16:48,112 --> 00:16:49,729
Does it matter?

338
00:16:49,852 --> 00:16:51,170
You said you can fix it, right?

339
00:16:51,263 --> 00:16:52,380
Abby, I want you to know

340
00:16:52,465 --> 00:16:54,282
that you don't have to tell us anything.

341
00:16:54,367 --> 00:16:56,951
We can bring a counselor down
for you to talk to.

342
00:16:57,036 --> 00:16:59,235
No. No more doctors.

343
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:01,856
I have enough doctors,
and I don't need a shrink.

344
00:17:01,941 --> 00:17:05,517
I just... need my stomach
to stop hurting is all.

345
00:17:05,603 --> 00:17:06,870
Okay.

346
00:17:08,072 --> 00:17:10,056
How did you get that?

347
00:17:10,312 --> 00:17:12,996
My neighbor's kids like to play
street hockey,

348
00:17:13,082 --> 00:17:14,258
and I'm crap at it.

349
00:17:14,344 --> 00:17:16,650
- I don't think that's true.
- Dr. Karev.

350
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:21,308
You keep looking at each other,
but I'm right here,

351
00:17:21,394 --> 00:17:24,353
so one of you say
whatever the hell it is

352
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:25,813
you're trying so hard not to say.

353
00:17:25,898 --> 00:17:27,229
- Abby...
- I'm worried your husband hurt you,

354
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:28,316
and from the marks on your legs,

355
00:17:28,401 --> 00:17:29,993
possibly sexually assaulted you.

356
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:31,496
Dr. Karev, hallway. Now.

357
00:17:31,582 --> 00:17:34,433
Jack would never.
He's never raised his voice.

358
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:36,134
- He's calm.
- Then someone else did...

359
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,426
Isn't the OR
ready by now?

360
00:17:38,511 --> 00:17:39,594
'Cause this hurts like a...

361
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,062
Abby, if we take you
to the OR,

362
00:17:41,147 --> 00:17:42,480
we have to make you sterile,

363
00:17:42,565 --> 00:17:44,198
so everything that happened
to you, all the evidence,

364
00:17:44,283 --> 00:17:45,766
it all goes away.

365
00:17:45,851 --> 00:17:47,462
You can still report it.

366
00:17:47,547 --> 00:17:50,595
I'm not reporting anything.
There's nothing to report.

367
00:17:50,681 --> 00:17:53,240
That is your choice.
It is all your choice.

368
00:17:53,325 --> 00:17:55,509
But if something happened...
if it did...

369
00:17:55,594 --> 00:17:57,945
we could gather the evidence
and seal it away

370
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,375
until you are ready
to do something about it.

371
00:18:03,091 --> 00:18:06,032
We all know if I do that kit...

372
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:08,802
it ends up in the back
of some police station,

373
00:18:09,016 --> 00:18:11,267
ignored for years,

374
00:18:11,477 --> 00:18:14,395
while I sit there wondering
when the bomb will go off,

375
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,540
waiting to see if a jury
of my peers will believe...

376
00:18:19,861 --> 00:18:21,401
...believe a woman

377
00:18:21,487 --> 00:18:24,441
who wore a skirt
a few inches too short,

378
00:18:24,946 --> 00:18:27,875
who had a few cocktails too many
at a bar last night

379
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,564
after having a fight

380
00:18:30,006 --> 00:18:33,759
about laundry
with her husband.

381
00:18:35,301 --> 00:18:38,619
And you know the tequila I drank
will make it my fault,

382
00:18:38,704 --> 00:18:41,226
and whoever did this to me,
whatever he drank...

383
00:18:41,312 --> 00:18:43,324
that'll be his excuse!

384
00:18:49,031 --> 00:18:53,117
Is your kit gonna convince them
I wasn't flirting at the bar?

385
00:18:53,318 --> 00:18:57,137
If I give them my story
and my underwear,

386
00:18:57,223 --> 00:19:00,441
will it prove to them...
or to my husband...

387
00:19:00,526 --> 00:19:03,310
that I didn't cheat on him
and make up some story

388
00:19:03,395 --> 00:19:05,312
just to save my own ass?

389
00:19:05,397 --> 00:19:07,314
Okay...</font>

390
00:19:07,399 --> 00:19:09,250
Will your kit do that?!

391
00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:13,356
O... All... All right, deep breath.

392
00:19:13,442 --> 00:19:15,159
That's it.

393
00:19:15,374 --> 00:19:17,536
Slow deep breath.

394
00:19:21,205 --> 00:19:23,689
My ex-husband,
he hurt me.

395
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:26,231
Not in the way that you
were hurt, but he hit me...

396
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:28,231
he hurt me, for years.

397
00:19:28,354 --> 00:19:31,395
And I was so, so terrified.

398
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,051
And so convinced that
no one would believe me,

399
00:19:34,193 --> 00:19:36,660
and I was so, so alone...

400
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:39,446
I never had the chance
or the choice

401
00:19:39,532 --> 00:19:41,348
to hold him responsible.

402
00:19:41,433 --> 00:19:42,504
I can't imagine

403
00:19:42,589 --> 00:19:43,884
how you are feeling right now.

404
00:19:43,969 --> 00:19:45,295
I can't.

405
00:19:45,699 --> 00:19:49,385
But, one day,
you might feel differently.

406
00:19:49,471 --> 00:19:50,857
You might want justice,

407
00:19:50,943 --> 00:19:55,576
and I want you to have
everything you need to do that.

408
00:20:04,339 --> 00:20:07,808
My husband...
he can never know.

409
00:20:07,893 --> 00:20:09,394
He won't have to.

410
00:20:15,303 --> 00:20:17,087
Do it.

411
00:20:17,173 --> 00:20:19,490
Just do the damn kit.

412
00:20:19,576 --> 00:20:20,826
Okay. Okay.

413
00:20:22,274 --> 00:20:23,357
That's it. There you go.

414
00:20:23,442 --> 00:20:24,391

The police, your parents...

460
00:22:41,254 --> 00:22:44,882
I convinced the few people
who noticed

461
00:22:44,968 --> 00:22:46,507
that it was just the freshman 15,

462
00:22:46,593 --> 00:22:50,484
and I...
was able to dodge Christmas break

463
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:55,090
by lying about...
finals and work studies.

464
00:22:55,176 --> 00:22:56,859
You didn't tell anyone you were pregnant?

465
00:22:56,945 --> 00:22:58,311
No, no.

466
00:22:59,705 --> 00:23:00,835
I mean, it...

467
00:23:00,945 --> 00:23:04,398
it wasn't until years
after it happened that...

468
00:23:04,515 --> 00:23:05,660
After <i>I</i> happened.

469
00:23:05,746 --> 00:23:07,272
After the rape happened.

470
00:23:09,382 --> 00:23:10,835
After I was raped.

471
00:23:12,652 --> 00:23:14,802
I eventually
found my way to therapy,

472
00:23:14,887 --> 00:23:16,170
and I did all the work,

473
00:23:16,255 --> 00:23:18,373
and I wrote in journals,

474
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:20,640
and I learned all
the PTSD triggers.

475
00:23:20,726 --> 00:23:22,484
I-I actually had to work through

476
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:23,883
calling it "rape" to begin with.

477
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:26,274
Because I did say yes to that date,

478
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,576
and I did say yes to getting
in that car, and...

479
00:23:29,963 --> 00:23:32,827
Someone somewhere
along the way...

480
00:23:32,913 --> 00:23:33,890
a man, most likely...

481
00:23:33,976 --> 00:23:35,875
decided they wanted to qualify
this word, "rape."

482
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,585
You know, date rape,
 a-acquaintance rape.

483
00:23:38,671 --> 00:23:41,499
Somehow, it... it... it...
it's... it's not as real

484
00:23:41,585 --> 00:23:43,077
unless it happens to a woman

485
00:23:43,163 --> 00:23:46,768
who's running through the park
at night or...

486
00:23:47,046 --> 00:23:50,438
or walking down a dark alley.

487
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,374
As somehow,
because I knew him,

488
00:23:53,476 --> 00:23:55,381
what he took from me
didn't matter.

489
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:56,628
But it did matter.

490
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:59,678
I found a way to hear that.

491
00:23:59,764 --> 00:24:01,850
I found a way to believe that.

492
00:24:02,719 --> 00:24:04,342
And I...

493
00:24:06,005 --> 00:24:07,843
I found a way to move forward.

494
00:24:08,207 --> 00:24:09,890
You got therapy.

495
00:24:11,353 --> 00:24:12,436
Yeah.

496
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:14,279
You moved forward.

497
00:24:16,382 --> 00:24:18,049
Mm-hmm.

498
00:24:19,185 --> 00:24:21,653
And you didn't once try and find me?

499
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,663
I was petrified.

500
00:24:30,365 --> 00:24:34,450
I was petrified every single
moment of my pregnancy.

501
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,585
I mean, it was bad enough that
I had to see his face

502
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,454
every day in class.

503
00:24:39,592 --> 00:24:41,595
I was so terrified...

504
00:24:42,499 --> 00:24:47,043
imagining that
you'd be a boy

505
00:24:47,879 --> 00:24:51,804
and that you'd have his face
and his voice.

506
00:24:51,913 --> 00:24:55,770
And every day,
every kick, every movement,

507
00:24:55,855 --> 00:24:58,605
it just reminded me
where you came from.

508
00:25:01,093 --> 00:25:04,812
But, you know, movies and books
and... and magazines,

509
00:25:04,897 --> 00:25:07,585
they just kept talking about this...

510
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:13,794
love that you feel
the minute your baby is born.

511
00:25:14,106 --> 00:25:15,656
How instantaneous it is

512
00:25:15,741 --> 00:25:19,038
and how, um, your heart
just cracks wide open, and...

513
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:23,210
And I remember,
I kept telling myself

514
00:25:23,749 --> 00:25:25,691
that as soon as
I had you in my arms

515
00:25:25,777 --> 00:25:27,460
that I could do that

516
00:25:28,062 --> 00:25:29,647
and that I would do that.

517
00:25:30,002 --> 00:25:34,444
Other women did it,
so why couldn't I?

518
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:37,826
So I gave the hospital
a fake name.

519
00:25:37,912 --> 00:25:42,319
I left with you...
the day you were born.

520
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,904
I remember they wanted me to stay,

521
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:45,796
and they wanted me to rest,
but I just wanted to get out.

522
00:25:45,881 --> 00:25:48,233
I just wanted to get out of
there, and I just wanted...

523
00:25:52,124 --> 00:25:53,913
I just
wanted to be alone with you,

524
00:25:53,998 --> 00:25:56,377
and I just wanted it to be
the two of us, and...

525
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,553
...and I wanted to stare
at you and hold you...

526
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,204
...'til that love came.

527
00:26:09,115 --> 00:26:10,733
But it never did.

528
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:13,076
No, it did.

529
00:26:15,069 --> 00:26:16,063
It did.

530
00:26:16,148 --> 00:26:18,765
Everything they said
was absolutely right.

531
00:26:19,985 --> 00:26:22,467
My heart cracked wide open.

532
00:26:26,926 --> 00:26:28,476
It was never just us,

533
00:26:28,561 --> 00:26:31,236
no matter how hard I tried,
no matter what I did.

534
00:26:32,202 --> 00:26:34,678
I was just a reminder of him.

535
00:26:35,395 --> 00:26:37,779
I resented you
so much for it.

536
00:26:41,173 --> 00:26:43,295
I spent most of my life...

537
00:26:44,414 --> 00:26:47,850
doubting everyone
I ever met,

538
00:26:49,048 --> 00:26:51,715
leaving them before
they could leave me.

539
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,097
I am a grown woman.

540
00:26:56,388 --> 00:26:59,816
With a job that I love
and friends I love

541
00:26:59,957 --> 00:27:01,886
and a husband
who loves me,

542
00:27:01,972 --> 00:27:03,602
and still...

543
00:27:04,477 --> 00:27:05,784
still...

544
00:27:07,303 --> 00:27:11,354
I was walking around, uh,
\waiting,

545
00:27:12,972 --> 00:27:15,074
wondering if you would ever
find me.

546
00:27:17,034 --> 00:27:19,784
If you would ever say that
you're sorry.

547
00:27:23,382 --> 00:27:24,581
I did the best I could.

548
00:27:24,667 --> 00:27:27,206
The best you could would've been
to find an adoption agency

549
00:27:27,292 --> 00:27:29,570
and make sure I had a home
and someone to love me,

550
00:27:29,655 --> 00:27:31,800
not toss me away like garbage.

551
00:27:32,838 --> 00:27:35,948
It is so easy
to look at me now

552
00:27:36,034 --> 00:27:37,011
and think of all the ways

553
00:27:37,097 --> 00:27:40,933
that I could've been
kinder, better, or smarter,

554
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:42,566
but...

555
00:27:44,855 --> 00:27:47,238
...I was not the person
I am today.

556
00:27:47,324 --> 00:27:48,941
I was not in my right mind.

557
00:27:49,027 --> 00:27:51,376
I wasn't in my mind
at all.

558
00:27:53,363 --> 00:27:58,972
That night that...
that he held me down, screaming.

559
00:28:00,243 --> 00:28:03,295
That night that he had
his hands around my throat

560
00:28:03,589 --> 00:28:05,441
until I stopped screaming,

561
00:28:05,527 --> 00:28:07,824
when I was hovering over
my own body

562
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:10,210
while he was tearing away
at me,

563
00:28:10,348 --> 00:28:12,872
that night that he smiled

564
00:28:13,032 --> 00:28:17,245
and he forced me to say
that I liked it,

565
00:28:18,344 --> 00:28:20,620
when he laughed and...

566
00:28:22,573 --> 00:28:26,109
...promised that we could do it
any time that I wanted to...

567
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,750
...that was the night
that I lost my right mind.

568
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:36,737
He stole it from me,
and for nine months...

569
00:28:36,822 --> 00:28:39,502
for nine months,
I pretended I was fine.

570
00:28:39,868 --> 00:28:42,194
I pretended that
I wasn't a zombie,

571
00:28:42,327 --> 00:28:45,245
that I wasn't numb
or dead inside.

572
00:28:45,864 --> 00:28:48,049
And then, the day that
you were born,

573
00:28:48,135 --> 00:28:51,463
I held you, and
I looked at your face,

574
00:28:51,549 --> 00:28:52,653
and I...

575
00:28:55,432 --> 00:28:57,558
...I could feel again for the first time,

576
00:28:57,643 --> 00:28:59,080
but...

577
00:29:03,815 --> 00:29:05,385
...my mind...

578
00:29:07,186 --> 00:29:08,862
...that took years to come back.

579
00:29:08,948 --> 00:29:11,689
In fact, I'm...
Part of it never did.

580
00:29:14,727 --> 00:29:16,963
Of course you deserved better.

581
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:24,127
I didn't have better to give you.

582
00:29:33,065 --> 00:29:34,628
I was seven weeks pregnant

583
00:29:34,713 --> 00:29:37,104
when my ex-husband cracked
my ribs

584
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:39,510
and threw me across
the living room floor.

585
00:29:41,186 --> 00:29:42,815
He didn't know that
I was pregnant,

586
00:29:42,901 --> 00:29:46,940
and I decided in that moment
that he could never know.

587
00:29:49,132 --> 00:29:52,135
I couldn't... I couldn't see a way out.

588
00:29:52,914 --> 00:29:54,380
Not then, at least.

589
00:29:56,298 --> 00:29:57,909
I knew that, if I tried to leave,

590
00:29:58,026 --> 00:29:59,534
he would kill me.

591
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:02,690
But I also knew that
I couldn't raise a kid

592
00:30:02,775 --> 00:30:06,477
in that... fear, and in that danger.

593
00:30:07,992 --> 00:30:09,565
You had an abortion.

594
00:30:10,415 --> 00:30:12,104
I've never told anyone that.

595
00:30:13,719 --> 00:30:15,823
I don't know why.
I'm not ashamed of it.

596
00:30:15,909 --> 00:30:16,955
I...

597
00:30:18,791 --> 00:30:21,080
I did what I had to do.

598
00:30:34,606 --> 00:30:36,409
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

599
00:30:40,979 --> 00:30:42,721
Do I look like him?

600
00:30:48,873 --> 00:30:51,034
You have my father's eyes...

601
00:30:52,996 --> 00:30:54,565
but the hair is all mine.

602
00:30:57,346 --> 00:30:59,838
And maybe the fire
in the belly.

603
00:31:03,101 --> 00:31:05,385
I did the best I could,

604
00:31:05,568 --> 00:31:07,018
and I'm still...

605
00:31:10,198 --> 00:31:12,987
I'm sorry. I'm still
just doing the best I can.

606
00:31:41,582 --> 00:31:44,020
She's becoming increasingly
tachypneic.

607
00:31:44,256 --> 00:31:46,330
Let OR 1 know that
we're on our way.

608
00:31:46,474 --> 00:31:48,332
Abby, it's time.

609
00:31:48,417 --> 00:31:49,526
We have to go up now.

610
00:31:49,612 --> 00:31:50,873
No. I'm not...
I'm not ready. I'm...

611
00:31:50,958 --> 00:31:52,670
Abby, I know you're scared.

612
00:31:52,755 --> 00:31:53,975
No, you're gonna...
you're gonna...

613
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:56,907
you're gonna take me out
and knock me out where I...

614
00:31:56,992 --> 00:31:59,260
the last time I was out,
h-he knocked me out.

615
00:31:59,345 --> 00:32:00,544
Abby.
Abby, listen to me.

616
00:32:00,629 --> 00:32:03,036
If we don't do this surgery now,
it could kill you.

617
00:32:03,122 --> 00:32:04,872
I can't.

618
00:32:05,144 --> 00:32:08,028
I can't leave here, this room.

619
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:10,588
Everyone has his face,
every man.

620
00:32:10,673 --> 00:32:12,223
It's all I see.

621
00:32:12,308 --> 00:32:14,358
Even when I
close my eyes...

622
00:32:14,443 --> 00:32:16,622
Please.
I can't see his face.

623
00:32:16,708 --> 00:32:18,262
Please don't I...
make me see his face, please.

624
00:32:18,347 --> 00:32:20,184
You don't have to, Abby.

625
00:32:20,269 --> 00:32:21,725
You don't have to.

626
00:32:24,134 --> 00:32:25,243
Okay.

627
00:32:25,547 --> 00:32:29,286
Tuck says they're talking.
What is that? Talking?

628
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:31,242
I think they're dating.

629
00:32:31,327 --> 00:32:33,591
Mnh. Why do they do that?

630
00:32:33,762 --> 00:32:35,575
Why do they insist
on coming up with new words

631
00:32:35,661 --> 00:32:37,414
when the old words were
just fine?

632
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,180
It's not funny.

633
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:43,907
Well, you... you do sound
a little, you know,

634
00:32:43,993 --> 00:32:45,188
"Get off my lawn!"

635
00:32:45,274 --> 00:32:46,290
No.

636
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:48,954
I want him to be happy.

637
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,532
I want him to, you know,

638
00:32:50,618 --> 00:32:53,095
have the butterflies
and first love and all that.

639
00:32:53,181 --> 00:32:54,688
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, just not so soon.

640
00:32:56,819 --> 00:32:58,954
We're gonna have
to sit his butt down

641
00:32:59,071 --> 00:33:01,422
and teach him about respect...

642
00:33:02,993 --> 00:33:05,709
...empathy, consent.

643
00:33:05,794 --> 00:33:07,270
Condoms... Oh, dear Lord.

644
00:33:07,356 --> 00:33:09,075
I have to talk to my son
about condoms.

645
00:33:09,161 --> 00:33:10,781
100%.</font>

646
00:33:10,891 --> 00:33:12,201
Or...

647
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,687
I could sit down with him.

648
00:33:16,324 --> 00:33:17,977
It can be on you.

649
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:23,499
But my dad gave me this talk,
and it worked.

650
00:33:26,606 --> 00:33:28,223
Mm, I gotta go.

651
00:33:32,588 --> 00:33:33,786
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

652
00:33:33,872 --> 00:33:35,282
You, uh...
You can't go through there.

653
00:33:35,367 --> 00:33:36,508
Well, why not?

654
00:33:36,739 --> 00:33:38,725
Because I've been asked
to see that you don't.

655
00:33:38,811 --> 00:33:39,854
Wha...

656
00:33:42,036 --> 00:33:43,517
Well, but she can go?

657
00:33:43,603 --> 00:33:44,749
Yes, sir.

658
00:33:52,608 --> 00:33:55,098
Dr. Karev asked us
to all stand here?

659
00:33:55,184 --> 00:33:56,105
Do we know why?

660
00:33:56,191 --> 00:33:59,055
Just... that a patient needs us.

661
00:33:59,651 --> 00:34:01,162
She needs all of us.

662
00:34:02,335 --> 00:34:03,475
Okay.

663
00:34:06,772 --> 00:34:08,892
<i>Okay, ladies,
we need you all to line up</i>

664
00:34:09,016 --> 00:34:10,594

665
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:13,273

with no.

693
00:36:21,926 --> 00:36:23,640
- <i><font color="#ffff00">♪ Watching you go ♪</font></i>
- idea how to talk about it.

694
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:27,917
What you did today with Abby,
that was not protocol...

695
00:36:28,003 --> 00:36:29,926
- <i><font color="#ffff00"> ♪ You said, "I wanna see the world" ♪</font></i>
- I know, I know, and I'm sorry.

696
00:36:30,011 --> 00:36:33,628
- <i><font color="#ffff00">♪ And I said ♪</font></i>

697

698
00:36:43,985 --> 00:36:45,652
Abby, hi.

699
00:36:46,988 --> 00:36:49,029
We were able to repair
your diaphragm.

700
00:36:49,115 --> 00:36:51,435
We had to place in a chest tube
for drainage,

701
00:36:51,521 --> 00:36:53,661
but that'll probably come out
in a few days.

702
00:36:54,322 --> 00:36:58,174
And your kit will stay here,
if you decide to report it.

703
00:37:00,067 --> 00:37:01,918
You think I should do it, don't you?

704
00:37:02,003 --> 00:37:04,255
That is not
our call to make.

705
00:37:05,789 --> 00:37:08,537
But we do think that
you should talk to someone.

706
00:37:09,013 --> 00:37:10,723
Doesn't have to be your husband.

707
00:37:11,612 --> 00:37:13,056
But someone.

708
00:37:13,807 --> 00:37:16,243
I keep going over it
in my head.

709
00:37:17,753 --> 00:37:20,714
If I hadn't been
so distracted by my phone.

710
00:37:21,923 --> 00:37:23,606
If I had just trusted my gut

711
00:37:23,691 --> 00:37:26,386
and not gone down that street
with the broken lamplights.

712
00:37:26,471 --> 00:37:27,849
Abby.

713
00:37:29,226 --> 00:37:32,796
This was not your fault.

714
00:37:33,608 --> 00:37:35,476
You didn't ask
for this.

715
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:40,170
There is nothing
you did to deserve this.

716
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:43,873
I can't.

717
00:37:43,959 --> 00:37:45,109
I just can't...

718
00:37:45,195 --> 00:37:46,929
Okay, that's okay.

719
00:37:48,115 --> 00:37:49,902
I'll check in on you
in a little bit, all right?

720
00:37:49,987 --> 00:37:51,142
Try to get some rest.

721
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,757
<i>Dr. Felix to the ER.</i>

722
00:37:53,842 --> 00:37:55,185
<i>Dr. Felix to the ER.</i>

723
00:37:59,666 --> 00:38:01,199
Jack...

724
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:07,717
He's gonna look at me
and see this broken person.

725
00:38:10,282 --> 00:38:14,326
If I tell him this,
it's all he'll ever see.

726
00:38:14,412 --> 00:38:15,712
Abby, look at me.

727
00:38:17,143 --> 00:38:18,993
This doesn't define you.

728
00:38:19,179 --> 00:38:21,630
And whether you tell
your husband or you report it

729
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:24,586
or you don't tell another soul,
you're a survivor.

730
00:38:24,707 --> 00:38:26,459
You survived.

731
00:38:27,375 --> 00:38:29,748
I still feel nauseous
when I see

732
00:38:29,834 --> 00:38:32,608
men in expensive shoes
with the points of the toes,

733
00:38:32,693 --> 00:38:35,092
because that's how my ex-husband
made my kidney bleed.

734
00:38:35,209 --> 00:38:37,814
For years, I thought
I got what I deserved,

735
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:40,451
that I was responsible,
that maybe,

736
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:45,138
just maybe if I had said or done
one thing differently...

737
00:38:45,324 --> 00:38:46,922
But none of that was
your fault.

738
00:38:47,201 --> 00:38:48,484
No.

739
00:38:53,609 --> 00:38:55,318
It's not your fault.

740
00:39:07,925 --> 00:39:10,272
Do you have a phone
I can use?

741
00:39:10,716 --> 00:39:11,900
Yes.

742
00:39:17,235 --> 00:39:18,990
Will you stay?

743
00:39:19,076 --> 00:39:21,037
As long as you need.
