1
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:06,707
Previously on "ER."

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,241
How long have you been sober?

3
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:09,576
Almost five years.

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,111
Your mother's not coming.

5
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:12,546
John, we're getting divorced.

6
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:14,380
‐ Stop! Oh, you're hurting me!
‐ 'Paul, Paul.'

7
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:16,282
‐ Please stop!
‐ Check the stylet.

8
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:18,519
We believe he may
have schizophrenia.

9
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:21,054
Paul wouldn't hurt
anyone. He couldn't.

10
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:28,061
I'm not deformed!

11
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:29,530
‐ Temperature's 95.
‐ No!

12
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:32,232
Don't stick that!
Get off of me!

13
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:34,300
‐ Get pregnant!
‐ I was pregnant!

14
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:36,269
I had an abortion.

15
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:38,371
You never even told
Richard, did you?

16
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,278
'You were supposed
to wake me up.'

17
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:47,113
'I'm not your
damn mother, Brian.'

18
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:49,115
'Why the hell is
it so cold in here?'

19
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:50,817
'I called the super twice!
What have you done?'

20
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:52,586
'I was studying
so I can get a job'

21
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:54,420
'that pays enough for us
to move out of this pit.'

22
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:56,289
'You don't even
realize how you talk'

23
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:58,091
'to me sometimes.
It's disgusting'

24
00:00:58,124 --> 00:00:59,626
'You just don't
know when to stop.'

25
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,628
‐ 'You just keep pushing me.'
‐ 'I have a life too.'

26
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:03,463
'And I cannot keep waiting
on you hand and foot.'

27
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:05,131
'You know what
your problem is‐‐'

28
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:06,166
'We're supposed
to be working together'

29
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:07,200
'as a team, but we don't'

30
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,502
'do that because you don't'

31
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:10,804
'treat me as a equal,
you treat me like crap.'

32
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:12,506
'How do you think
it makes me feel?'

33
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:14,741
'You're constantly belittling
me, even in public.'

34
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:16,376
'Can you give me
at least five minutes'

35
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,144
'in the morning before
you act like a bitch‐‐'

36
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:19,179
'Shut up!'

37
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:20,614
Both of you, shut up.

38
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:22,182
'You know what
your problem is, Brian?'

39
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:23,650
'You don't need me.
You don't even like..'

40
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:28,454
'...cook and clean and pick
up your dirty laundry.'

41
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:30,390
'But guess what,
that's not why..'

42
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:31,892
'Hi, this is Abby,
leave a message.'

43
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:34,628
'Hello, Abby?'

44
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:37,263
'Abby, are you there?
Hello? Abby?'

45
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:39,432
'Thought I'd catch
you before your shift.'

46
00:01:39,465 --> 00:01:41,434
'Anyway, I wanted to
wish you a happy birthday.'

47
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:44,538
‐ Hi, mom.
‐ 'Did I wake you up?'

48
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,773
No, I was just getting up.

49
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:49,375
Thank you.

50
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:00,153
Ooh.

51
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:03,223
Ooh! Ooh, your
feet are like ice!

52
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:05,358
I'm sorry.

53
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:07,460
Uh, I put on some coffee.

54
00:02:07,493 --> 00:02:08,595
What time is it?

55
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:09,663
It's about seven thirty.

56
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:10,697
Mm‐hmm.

57
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:11,765
You sleep okay?

58
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,667
Yeah. You?

59
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,869
Hmm. Except for the snoring.

60
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:18,672
Well, I don't snore.

61
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:21,241
Oh, yeah, right.
Like a truck driver.

62
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:23,544
I don't snore.

63
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:27,347
Stop it.

64
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,784
Stop it.

65
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,218
Oh, no!

66
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:34,755
Oh, yeah?
Oh, wait a minute.

67
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:39,760
I've arranged
for a nurse's aide

68
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:41,294
for you for while I'm at work.

69
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,296
‐ A nurse?
‐ Just for a couple of weeks.

70
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:46,332
I've got half a dozen people
in this house every day.

71
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:48,969
Well, then one more
isn't going to hurt.

72
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,737
If it gets any
colder, I'm going to

73
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:52,338
winter in the Bahamas.

74
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:53,507
Alone.

75
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,809
I thought I heard someone.

76
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,579
Is it just me or is
it freezing in here?

77
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:00,280
Mom, what are
you doing here?

78
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:01,615
I assumed you
could use a hand

79
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,216
while your
grandmother recovered.

80
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:05,418
How are you
feeling, Millicent?

81
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:07,521
I've been better.

82
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:10,857
‐ Where's Jack?
‐ Uh, Kansas City, I think.

83
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:12,358
You don't know?

84
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:14,861
He's on an extended
business trip.

85
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:17,363
We missed the pleasure
of your company at Christmas.

86
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:18,999
You know how
the holidays can be.

87
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,535
‐ Where are you staying?
‐ I was hoping to stay here.

88
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:23,904
‐ In the house?
‐ Yes, if that's alright.

89
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:27,373
‐ Yeah?
‐ It is freezing in here.

90
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,475
Would somebody please
turn up the furnace.

91
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,646
‐ I will go get Alger on it.
‐ 'It won't start.'

92
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,581
‐ 'Did you flood it?'
‐ 'No, it won't even turn over.'

93
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:35,682
'Did you leave your
lights on again?'

94
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,350
‐ No.
‐ You probably did.

95
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,519
‐ Excuse me.
‐ No, I didn't. Hi.

96
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,420
‐ Hi.
‐ Do you have any jumper cables?

97
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:42,288
No, sorry.
I take the El.

98
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:43,356
I guess you're not
the only one today.

99
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,358
Give me the keys.

100
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,529
My husband's not
really a morning person.

101
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,030
Hi, I'm Joyce.

102
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,265
We just moved here a few
weeks ago from Virginia.

103
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:53,834
‐ Hi. Abby.
‐ We're in 205.

104
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:56,803
I know. I think you
guys are right beside me.

105
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:58,739
Nice meeting you.

106
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:01,775
‐ So, I guess we're neighbors.
‐ Just a wall between us.

107
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,309
Well, maybe, uh,
you could come over

108
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:04,911
for coffee
or something sometime.

109
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:06,847
Sure.

110
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,414
Hey, can we give you
a ride somewhere?

111
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:09,850
‐ No, thank you.
‐ Are you sure?

112
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:11,417
It's really cold out there.

113
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:14,287
I'm fine.

114
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,856
I told you.
You flooded it.

115
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:22,428
Welcome to Chicago.

116
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:26,667
Oh!

117
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,839
Oh, son of a bitch.

118
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:27,728
You're leaving?

119
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:29,763
I phoned the Pediatric
Cancer Society

120
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,798
to inform them she wasn't
coming to their luncheon

121
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:34,501
and they managed to corral me.

122
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:35,636
You don't really
have to do that.

123
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:36,970
She wasn't
planning on going.

124
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,972
She just does
that for effect.

125
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,441
I'm aware
of her behavior.

126
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:43,977
But they actually
were expecting her.

127
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,080
‐ You'll be back tonight?
‐ You're really staying?

128
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:50,083
Yes. Unless
I'm not welcome.

129
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:52,519
No, no, it's just..

130
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:53,654
...I thought you
were covering.

131
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,622
Dad's in Denver, actually.

132
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,461
‐ Your father told you.
‐ Well, it was pretty obvious.

133
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:03,564
He was here for two days
at Christmas without you.

134
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:08,034
You thought he
was still here.

135
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:11,437
Uh, we, uh, left it
a little open‐ended.

136
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,807
‐ Really?
‐ I'm sorry, John.

137
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,409
I should have phoned you and let
you know that I was coming.

138
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,579
Yeah, well.

139
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:20,581
It's good to see you.

140
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:30,156
Sanitation guys found
him in a dumpster.

141
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,926
Minimally responsive to deep
pain, thready pulse in the 50s.

142
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,461
‐ You sure he's not dead?
‐ He's still moving air.

143
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:36,763
Barely.

144
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:38,665
Abby, can you bring this guy in?

145
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,000
I haven't even clocked in yet.

146
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:42,736
I know, but you have a coat on.

147
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,638
Hey, I know this guy.

148
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:46,172
Oh, man!

149
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:47,774
Is this great, or what?

150
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:49,943
Empty chairs, empty racks.

151
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,712
Nothing like
sub‐arctic temperatures

152
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:52,846
to keep the freaks at home.

153
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,748
Yeah, except it's
freezing in here.

154
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,082
Maintenance is
checking the furnace.

155
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:57,518
This is what we get for punching

156
00:06:57,551 --> 00:06:58,552
holes in the ozone layer.

157
00:06:58,585 --> 00:06:59,920
Uh, isn't the greenhouse effect

158
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:01,154
supposed to make it warmer?

159
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:02,222
Greenhouse effect, my ass.

160
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,690
It's 40 below out there.

161
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:05,726
‐ What's this?
‐ This is Icicle Andy.

162
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,027
You want him, he's yours.

163
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,829
I thought he froze
to death last year.

164
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:11,965
‐ The iceman cometh back.
‐ Okay, Trauma One's open.

165
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,167
Get his core temp,
pump in some warm saline

166
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,503
and throw a heating
blanket on him.

167
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:18,471
Oh, I'd keep that
on if I were you.

168
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:21,775
He's bradying down.

169
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,644
No luck. Now it's A‐fib.

170
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:25,912
Sounds like
rhonchi on the right.

171
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,514
Probably pneumonia.

172
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:28,715
I think he's
decreased on the left.

173
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:29,983
Do you wanna
put in a chest tube?

174
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:31,251
'Uh, not if I can help it.'

175
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,919
This guy's got
bad vascular disease.

176
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:35,656
‐ We'll never get a line in him.
‐ Fine, prep for lavage.

177
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:38,224
Oh, man, look at this
dude's hands. Ugh.

178
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:40,260
‐ Can you get a pulse ox?
‐ I don't know.

179
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,162
Can barely get the monitor..

180
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:43,263
Ugh!

181
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,831
What's wrong?

182
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,068
It snapped off.

183
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:50,837
Ah, he gave you
the finger, huh, Abby?

184
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:54,040
‐ Can they reattach that?
‐ Not without superglue.

185
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:56,142
Okay, let's get
a central line kit

186
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:58,044
Betadine and some
warm blankets to start.

187
00:07:58,078 --> 00:07:59,913
No, no, you can't come in
here. You have to go back.

188
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,782
‐ Where's my mom?
‐ She's not in here.

189
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,116
Yes, she was.

190
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,652
‐ You got this?
‐ Yeah.

191
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:07,153
Warm liter of IV saline..

192
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:09,189
You lost your mom?

193
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,191
It's not one of these
two ladies right here?

194
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:12,693
She was in there.

195
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:14,895
Okay, well, maybe
she's all finished.

196
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:16,229
Do you wanna see
if we can find her?

197
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:17,564
I'm Abby.
What's your name?

198
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:18,932
‐ Douglas.
‐ Douglas what?

199
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:21,668
‐ Douglas Leeman.
‐ Okay, Douglas, right this way.

200
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:22,836
What's your mom's name?

201
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,571
‐ B.
‐ B?

202
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:26,740
Is that short for Beatrice?

203
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:28,809
Barbara? Betty?

204
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,644
‐ Just B.
‐ Just B? Okay.

205
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,312
‐ Abby, can you help me?
‐ Uh, sure.

206
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,881
Frank, this is Douglas Leeman.
He's lost his mom.

207
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:38,284
This is Frank. He's very
good at finding people's moms.

208
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:40,186
Douglas, you
like doughnuts?

209
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,888
When did the chest
pains start?

210
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:44,791
This morning, but I've
been feeling crappy for..

211
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:46,627
...a couple of days.

212
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,329
I thought it was just
a cold or...maybe the flu.

213
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,197
Bibasilar rales.

214
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:53,133
Have you experienced
any shortness of breath?

215
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,167
Yeah.

216
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,036
I thought I'd step outside

217
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:59,305
catch a breath of fresh air,
I got so dizzy I fainted.

218
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,942
Three plus pitting
edema on both feet.

219
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:03,810
Have you ever had
anything like this before?

220
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:05,779
‐ Never.
‐ Do you have a heart condition?

221
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:06,813
No.

222
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:08,649
Are you on birth
control pills?

223
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:11,718
No, I‐I'm trying to,
to get pregnant.

224
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:14,054
I've been taking
fertility drugs.

225
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:16,923
‐ FSH.
‐ For how long?

226
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:21,261
‐ Um...what's today?
‐ Uh, the tenth.

227
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:24,297
‐ Yeah, then I'm on my tenth.
‐ 'Alright.'

228
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,199
Let's get a CBC, Chem‐20

229
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:29,302
a DIC panel and a D‐dimer.

230
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:32,372
Am I having some sort
of reaction to the drugs?

231
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,808
It's possible, but we
need to run some more tests

232
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:36,009
to know for sure.

233
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:37,611
You've got fluid
in your lungs

234
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:39,613
which could be
a sign of a blood clot.

235
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:40,947
A blood clot?

236
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:44,184
It's unlikely, but I
just want to make sure.

237
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:47,220
It could be a possible side
effect of the medication.

238
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,090
Well, let's do a Doppler.
I'll be back.

239
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:53,927
Do you want me to
call your husband?

240
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,063
‐ I'm not married.
‐ Oh, boyfriend?

241
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,365
I decided to..

242
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,367
...have a baby on my own.

243
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:04,004
Got tired of waiting
around for Mr. Right.

244
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:06,973
I know that story.

245
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:11,712
Chest x‐ray and an EKG?

246
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:14,414
Yeah, and set
her up for a VQ.

247
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,049
Haven't seen you
around lately.

248
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,218
I've been working nights.

249
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:20,286
‐ How was your Christmas?
‐ Quiet.

250
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,223
‐ What'd you do for New Year's?
‐ I worked.

251
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:25,025
That's always fun.

252
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:27,193
Did you make
any resolutions?

253
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:29,029
Uh, I'm going
to help out more.

254
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:31,865
‐ Help out more where? Here?
‐ Uh, no, Europe.

255
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:34,768
I've, uh, volunteered
to go to Bosnia

256
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,436
for two months with
Doctors Without Borders.

257
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,972
‐ Bosnia?
‐ Yeah, I speak the language.

258
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:41,107
‐ What brought this on?
‐ I don't know.

259
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,676
Change of scenery.

260
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:46,780
'Good, huh?'

261
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:50,016
Hey, nice hat, Snoop.

262
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,051
Hey, Frank, I thought
you said you were

263
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:52,218
gonna get the heat turned up.

264
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:53,820
‐ They're working on it.
‐ Oh, really?

265
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:56,456
Is that why the thermostat
in the lounge says 56?

266
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,059
Get used to it, we're
heading into another ice age

267
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:00,761
like the one that
killed the dinosaurs.

268
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:03,329
Cold didn't kill the dinosaurs,
Frank. Cholesterol did.

269
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:04,931
Mr. Ellis in Curtain
Three can go home.

270
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:07,133
Miss Renfrew in Four
needs to be admitted.

271
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:10,103
‐ Got a minute?
‐ Uh, no, not really.

272
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:12,105
I hope your day's shaping
up better than mine.

273
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:13,173
Doubt it.

274
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:14,708
I was picking up
Rachel's laundry

275
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:16,409
after you left and this
fell out of her jeans.

276
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:18,011
She's smoking.

277
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,046
I don't think she uses
it to light campfires.

278
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,415
‐ What are you going to do?
‐ I don't know.

279
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:24,250
Did you find anything
else in her pockets?

280
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:26,252
No.

281
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:27,788
Mark, what if it's
not cigarettes?

282
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:29,890
Her boyfriend tested
positive for marijuana.

283
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:31,725
Ex‐boyfriend.

284
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:33,827
‐ I should search her room.
‐ You think that's wise?

285
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,462
Well, if she's doing drugs,
I wanna know about it.

286
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:37,831
You know, asking her
doesn't guarantee

287
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,065
I'm gonna get the truth.

288
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:40,333
Yeah, but searching
her room, that's such

289
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,968
a violation of her privacy.

290
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:43,970
You suggested that I
rifle through her pockets.

291
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:45,471
In the course
of doing laundry.

292
00:11:45,506 --> 00:11:47,240
Dr. Greene, 29‐year‐old male

293
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:48,842
eight foot fall, no LOC.

294
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,533
‐ Can we talk about this?
‐ 'Come find me.'

295
00:11:50,533 --> 00:11:51,590
'Normal vitals.'

296
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:58,919
This is adorable.
Don't you think?

297
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:01,221
It's pretty cute.
You wanna buy it?

298
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:03,790
No, they won't let me
send him any gifts.

299
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,127
He must be getting
pretty big now, huh?

300
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,362
Yeah, oh, they
sent a video of him

301
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,998
walking just before
Christmas. It's..

302
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,434
It won't be long now before

303
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,136
he's asking to borrow
the keys to the car.

304
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,207
You know, I'm
starting to wonder

305
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,544
if I'm making any
right decisions lately.

306
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:25,812
Uh, it's mid‐year. Something
will open up by the spring.

307
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:28,214
Yeah, well, maybe they'll
open back up at County.

308
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,349
Hey, cool.

309
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,153
Have you seen these?
These are really neat.

310
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:36,857
John, um..

311
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,158
...what would you
say if I told you

312
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:40,961
I asked the waitress
at Doc Magoo's

313
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:42,529
if she remembered
Weaver being paged

314
00:12:42,563 --> 00:12:45,465
the night we lost
the Marfan case?

315
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:49,369
I'd sa‐a‐ay that place is
full of people with pagers.

316
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:51,371
I know. I was desperate.

317
00:12:52,873 --> 00:12:55,275
So, what, she
didn't remember?

318
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:58,011
Not about Weaver
getting paged.

319
00:12:58,044 --> 00:13:00,246
But she remembers
Weaver coming back in

320
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,083
looking for her pager
and finding it in the bathroom.

321
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:05,919
She couldn't
answer my page, John

322
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:08,454
because she didn't
have her pager.

323
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:11,892
‐ Are you sure?
‐ I believe it.

324
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:13,960
Don't you?

325
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,297
Yeah, that explains it.

326
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:20,534
What are you going to do?

327
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:26,106
‐ He die?
‐ Yup.

328
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:30,010
‐ Did you know him?
‐ Only as Icicle Andy.

329
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:31,945
I think he was
a Vietnam vet.

330
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,515
I heard bums are reincarnated
as pigeons when they die.

331
00:13:34,548 --> 00:13:36,249
Really?

332
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:38,418
I think it's
the other way around.

333
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,421
Check it out.

334
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:43,256
Tickets to tonight's
Blackhawks game

335
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:44,558
and they're
good seats too.

336
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:47,894
Whoa. Where'd
he get those?

337
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:49,462
‐ Any ID?
‐ Mm‐mm.

338
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:53,233
Just two dollars,
some change and matches.

339
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:54,568
Are you gonna
keep the tickets?

340
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:55,969
‐ No.
‐ Can I have them?

341
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,538
‐ No.
‐ Why not?

342
00:13:57,571 --> 00:13:59,405
I think it's
called grave‐robbing.

343
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:00,874
He ain't using them.

344
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:03,109
Well, somebody might
come to claim the body.

345
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:04,444
‐ Ha ha ha.
‐ I'm serious.

346
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:05,478
Yeah, right. Seriously.

347
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,180
‐ I need them.
‐ No.

348
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:09,149
Look, the tickets are
only for tonight, Abby.

349
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,584
‐ Nobody coming for this guy.
‐ Forget it.

350
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:12,953
Oh, come on, Abby.

351
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:14,254
Abby, look, he's
straight‐up dead.

352
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:17,323
Abby, can you take
a look at something?

353
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,392
‐ What patient?
‐ Uh, Mr. Paninski.

354
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:21,161
Unstable angina.
I called CCU.

355
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,663
I just wanted to make sure
I didn't miss anything.

356
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,230
‐ Did you do a rectal?
‐ No.

357
00:14:24,264 --> 00:14:25,431
‐ You better.
‐ Because?

358
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:27,200
Because if his stool
is heme‐positive‐‐

359
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,402
The heparin,
right. Thank you.

360
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:33,273
‐ Frank?
‐ Yeah?

361
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:34,575
You said you were
gonna find his mother.

362
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:36,042
I tried.

363
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:38,478
No B. Leeman
checked in today.

364
00:14:38,512 --> 00:14:42,015
I'm beginning to think
somebody dumped him.

365
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,650
He said his mother was in
Trauma One with a headache.

366
00:14:43,684 --> 00:14:46,019
Can you double‐check
it with the admit log?

367
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,053
Sure.

368
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:49,089
'Abby. Hi.'

369
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:50,957
‐ Richard.
‐ How's it going?

370
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:52,392
What are you doing here?

371
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:56,362
It's colder in here
than it is outside.

372
00:14:58,098 --> 00:14:59,099
You look great.

373
00:15:00,634 --> 00:15:03,970
Thank you.
Shift work becomes me.

374
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:06,339
‐ So, how are things?
‐ They're good.

375
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,474
Good. That's good.

376
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:11,111
You seeing anyone or..

377
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:12,378
Oh, yeah.

378
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,347
I'm breaking hearts
all over town.

379
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,019
What do you want, ex?

380
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:22,255
‐ "Ex?"
‐ Yeah.

381
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,024
Can I call you ex?

382
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:26,026
'Cause it's almost like
sexy so people might think

383
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:29,362
it's short for
ecstasy or triple‐X..

384
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:31,532
...which stands
for porn, uh, now

385
00:15:31,565 --> 00:15:34,234
except for in cartoons where
it, where it stands for poison

386
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,202
which I always
thought was funny, but..

387
00:15:37,638 --> 00:15:40,473
What do you want?

388
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:43,510
Oh, look, I, um..

389
00:15:43,544 --> 00:15:46,346
Well, I‐I wanted to
talk to you in person

390
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:49,382
so you didn't hear this
through the grapevine.

391
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,484
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ What?

392
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:54,287
Are you going to jail?

393
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,355
No.

394
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,126
Uh, I'm getting married.

395
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:05,498
‐ Married?
‐ Yeah.

396
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:07,100
You'd think I would've
learned my lesson.

397
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,169
I'm glad one of us did.

398
00:16:10,771 --> 00:16:13,640
‐ What, is she rich?
‐ Hardly. She's a teacher.

399
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:17,477
Not that one you
had at the museum.

400
00:16:17,511 --> 00:16:19,212
No, no, no.

401
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:20,747
Her name's Corrine.

402
00:16:20,781 --> 00:16:23,584
She's, uh, she's really great.
She's really down to Earth.

403
00:16:23,617 --> 00:16:25,085
I, uh, I think you
might even like her.

404
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:28,121
‐ How old is she?
‐ She's 34.

405
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,156
She has a,
a six‐year‐old son, Adam.

406
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,258
Really great kid.

407
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:37,798
‐ You're gonna be a father?
‐ Stepfather, yeah.

408
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:39,766
It's kind of hard
to believe, huh?

409
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,303
Yeah, it's like
a‐a instant family.

410
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,572
I always wanted kids, so..

411
00:16:45,606 --> 00:16:47,107
Since when?

412
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,776
Uh, you know, just a while.

413
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:52,178
I guess we just never
talked about it, you know?

414
00:16:57,584 --> 00:17:00,821
And you, uh, felt
that today was the day

415
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:03,489
you had to tell
me about all this?

416
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:05,592
Is today a bad day?

417
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:12,365
Nope.

418
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,668
Um...so, what?

419
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:17,303
Am I supposed to
give you my blessing?

420
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:20,106
That's up to you.

421
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,075
Well, I have to
get back to work.

422
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:32,118
Richard.

423
00:17:35,656 --> 00:17:37,724
I hope that it
works out this time.

424
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,261
'Thanks.'

425
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:50,236
‐ 'Aspen's great.'
‐ 'Mm.'

426
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,404
There's three
separate mountains.

427
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:52,405
So you‐you don't
have to be an expert.

428
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:54,307
Mm‐hmm.

429
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,441
Mm.

430
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:57,878
What is that?

431
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:58,712
What?

432
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,283
Yeah, they got
runs for every level.

433
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,722
‐ Is that your jaw?
‐ What?

434
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:09,790
That click,
click, click sound.

435
00:18:09,823 --> 00:18:11,391
Oh, my God.
You can hear that?

436
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,893
‐ Yeah.
‐ I can't help it.

437
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:15,228
I think I have this
TMJ hap‐happening thing.

438
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,698
‐ Here, chew.
‐ No.

439
00:18:17,731 --> 00:18:18,899
Come on. Just chew
so I can hear it.

440
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:21,134
No!

441
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:22,803
'Get out of here.'

442
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:28,809
‐ I'm gonna get back to work.
‐ I'm gonna take care of this.

443
00:18:28,842 --> 00:18:30,511
You should see
a dentist about that jaw.

444
00:18:30,544 --> 00:18:31,645
Yeah, either that
or you should find

445
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:33,547
someone else
to eat lunch with.

446
00:18:37,551 --> 00:18:39,485
I'm sorry about that.

447
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,487
What?

448
00:18:41,522 --> 00:18:42,723
I should have said
something to you sooner.

449
00:18:42,756 --> 00:18:44,725
It just sort of snuck up on me.

450
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:48,562
I hate it when that happens.

451
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:52,232
Well, it's really more about
friendship than anything else.

452
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:53,366
'Really?'

453
00:18:54,668 --> 00:18:57,571
Never seen you
kiss Frank like that.

454
00:18:57,604 --> 00:18:59,606
‐ Abby‐‐
‐ Don't sweat it, Carter.

455
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,052
‐ Where's Frank?
‐ Don't know.

456
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:17,791
Hey, Douglas.

457
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:20,527
Did you find your mom?

458
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:22,228
Are you getting hungry?

459
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:25,265
‐ Yeah.
‐ Would you like to eat pizza?

460
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:26,700
A hamburger?

461
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:28,835
My mom says fast food
isn't good for you.

462
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:34,374
Well...she's right,
but the fast food we serve here

463
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:36,610
at the hospital is specially
formulated to be nutritious.

464
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:38,612
So would you like
some French fries?

465
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:40,681
Okay. Sit tight.

466
00:19:40,714 --> 00:19:43,584
Hey, Frank!

467
00:19:43,617 --> 00:19:44,851
‐ I'm working on it.
‐ Well, work harder.

468
00:19:44,885 --> 00:19:46,620
He's been here for
a couple of hours.

469
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:48,589
If I find his mom, can
I have the hockey tickets

470
00:19:48,622 --> 00:19:49,856
you pinched off that stiff?

471
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,592
‐ No.
‐ Has anyone seen Dr. Kovac?

472
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,727
‐ What do you need?
‐ Mrs. Stipes' pressure's down.

473
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,696
Frank, find Luka.
What happened?

474
00:19:55,729 --> 00:19:57,430
She got dizzy.
Systolic's at 80.

475
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:59,232
I opened up the saline.

476
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:00,634
How you doing, Merril?

477
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:01,802
‐ 'Is it a PE?'
‐ I don't know.

478
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,470
Crank her oxygen up to 15 liters

479
00:20:04,505 --> 00:20:06,540
and grab some dopamine
off the crash cart.

480
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:08,441
She's got muffled
heart sounds and JVD.

481
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:09,876
Malik, we need
a pericardiocentesis

482
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:10,944
tray and a SonoSite.

483
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:12,513
‐ Okay.
‐ Pressure's down to 70.

484
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:14,247
You think it's tamponade?

485
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,616
Unless you got
any better ideas.

486
00:20:15,649 --> 00:20:17,417
‐ What happened?
‐ Hypotensive.

487
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,785
Signs of pericardial infusion.

488
00:20:18,819 --> 00:20:20,621
He thought she had a clot
from hyper‐stimulation?

489
00:20:20,654 --> 00:20:23,423
You can third space anywhere,
even around the heart.

490
00:20:24,925 --> 00:20:26,960
‐ There it is.
‐ Here you go, Abby.

491
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:28,494
Okay, glove up.
You can assist.

492
00:20:28,529 --> 00:20:30,296
Lidocaine's ready.

493
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,699
Abby, I think I
found that kid's mom

494
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:34,467
if she doesn't have
the same last name as him.

495
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,836
I don't know. Maybe.

496
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:37,504
Okay, hook up
the alligator clip.

497
00:20:37,538 --> 00:20:39,339
Belinda Matheson,
she came in last night

498
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:40,907
with a headache. Turned
out to be a brain bleed.

499
00:20:40,941 --> 00:20:43,376
‐ Insert subxiphoid, 45‐degree‐‐
‐ Last night?

500
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:44,477
Yeah. They admitted
her to neurosurg.

501
00:20:44,511 --> 00:20:45,746
Watch for injury current.

502
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:46,980
I can't believe that
little boy sat in chairs

503
00:20:47,013 --> 00:20:48,549
all night and nobody noticed.

504
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:50,016
'Can you take him
upstairs to his mother?'

505
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:52,986
Uh, that could be
difficult. She's dead.

506
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:55,656
What?

507
00:20:55,689 --> 00:20:57,323
Blood pressure's back up to 90.

508
00:20:57,357 --> 00:20:58,892
She stroked out
a few hours ago.

509
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,594
‐ 'Second syringe.'
‐ What do you want me to do?

510
00:21:00,627 --> 00:21:01,762
Abby?

511
00:21:01,795 --> 00:21:04,531
Um, well, just...
try to find his dad.

512
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:07,067
‐ Systolic's 110.
‐ And get him some French fries.

513
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,902
Okay. Good pickup.

514
00:21:13,006 --> 00:21:14,440
'Did you get in
touch with the father?'

515
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:15,942
He said he lives
in Los Angeles.

516
00:21:15,976 --> 00:21:18,011
‐ He doesn't know the number.
‐ It wasn't in here?

517
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:19,913
‐ I couldn't find it.
‐ Did you call his school?

518
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:21,347
No.

519
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:22,482
Well, I'm sure they
have a number, Frank.

520
00:21:22,516 --> 00:21:23,550
I thought you
used to be a cop.

521
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,552
‐ I was.
‐ Well, act like a cop.

522
00:21:25,586 --> 00:21:27,821
Track the guy down.

523
00:21:27,854 --> 00:21:29,756
'Did someone from neurosurg
come down and talk to him?'

524
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,658
Not yet.

525
00:21:31,692 --> 00:21:33,727
‐ Which doc treated his mother?
‐ Weaver.

526
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,862
She's working a half shift
today, so she's not in yet.

527
00:21:35,896 --> 00:21:37,531
Do you want me to page
somebody from neurosurg?

528
00:21:37,564 --> 00:21:38,865
I don't know, I think
somebody should come down

529
00:21:38,899 --> 00:21:40,801
and tell the little
boy his mother died.

530
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,371
No, she didn't.

531
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:54,615
Douglas, I need to talk to you
about your mom's headache, okay?

532
00:21:54,648 --> 00:21:56,382
Let's sit down.

533
00:21:58,652 --> 00:22:00,554
Alright, um..

534
00:22:01,955 --> 00:22:04,891
Uh, it was pretty bad.

535
00:22:04,925 --> 00:22:08,629
Um...it was caused by
a blood vessel in her brain

536
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:10,531
that...ruptured.

537
00:22:11,732 --> 00:22:12,933
It broke.

538
00:22:12,966 --> 00:22:15,769
And the doctors
tried really hard

539
00:22:15,802 --> 00:22:17,871
but they couldn't fix it.

540
00:22:17,904 --> 00:22:19,973
Can she go home now?

541
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:21,875
No, Douglas, I'm sorry.

542
00:22:21,908 --> 00:22:23,677
She died.

543
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,946
My mom has a headache.
She's not sick.

544
00:22:25,979 --> 00:22:26,980
I want to see her.

545
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:28,014
‐ Where is she?
‐ Douglas!

546
00:22:28,048 --> 00:22:29,983
Mom! Mom!

547
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:31,885
‐ Douglas!
‐ Mom!

548
00:22:31,918 --> 00:22:35,421
Mom! Mom, where are you?

549
00:22:35,455 --> 00:22:36,523
‐ Douglas.
‐ Mom!

550
00:22:36,557 --> 00:22:37,824
‐ Mom!
‐ Listen.

551
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:40,961
‐ Mom! Mom!
‐ Douglas, she's dead.

552
00:22:40,994 --> 00:22:42,428
Stop saying that.
Why do you keep saying that?

553
00:22:42,462 --> 00:22:43,564
I know it's hard
for you to understand.

554
00:22:43,597 --> 00:22:44,598
‐ I want my mom.
‐ I know you do.

555
00:22:44,631 --> 00:22:46,099
I just want my mom.

556
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:49,570
Shh.

557
00:22:49,603 --> 00:22:51,538
Shh, it's okay.

558
00:22:53,507 --> 00:22:54,741
'He finally went down?'

559
00:22:54,775 --> 00:22:56,476
'He's exhausted.'

560
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,978
Poor kid.

561
00:22:58,011 --> 00:23:00,614
I finally got
a hold of his dad.

562
00:23:00,647 --> 00:23:02,649
He's in Australia
on a business trip.

563
00:23:02,683 --> 00:23:03,817
Australia?

564
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,018
The soonest
flight he can get

565
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:06,953
is a red‐eye
tomorrow night.

566
00:23:06,987 --> 00:23:09,489
So, social services are going
to have to take him till then?

567
00:23:09,523 --> 00:23:10,991
Sorry. I'll call them.

568
00:23:11,024 --> 00:23:12,192
That's alright.
I'll do it. Thanks.

569
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:13,960
Can you grab me
the minute he gets up?

570
00:23:13,994 --> 00:23:15,929
Sure.

571
00:23:15,962 --> 00:23:18,431
Abby, do we do psychiatric
transfers to other hospitals?

572
00:23:18,464 --> 00:23:19,666
What?

573
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,967
I have a patient
in Curtain Three.

574
00:23:21,001 --> 00:23:22,503
He was admitted
with a tiny scalp lac

575
00:23:22,536 --> 00:23:24,104
from a slip‐and‐fall,
and he's insisting

576
00:23:24,137 --> 00:23:26,640
he be moved out of Curtain Three
and he wants me to call his

577
00:23:26,673 --> 00:23:28,942
caseworker from some
private hospital.

578
00:23:28,975 --> 00:23:30,443
Is he altered
from the fall?

579
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:32,979
No, but he seems
pretty agitated.

580
00:23:33,013 --> 00:23:35,215
Did you...get
a psych consult?

581
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:37,651
‐ Not yet.
‐ It probably wouldn't hurt.

582
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:42,989
The paramedics brought
me to this hospital.

583
00:23:43,023 --> 00:23:44,891
I didn't want to come here.

584
00:23:44,925 --> 00:23:47,561
Can you just please
call my caseworker

585
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:49,730
'and move me to another room?'

586
00:23:58,138 --> 00:24:00,741
'Please stop,
that's not necessary.'

587
00:24:00,774 --> 00:24:03,577
‐ You don't have to do that.
‐ It's just a precaution.

588
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:06,179
‐ What happened?
‐ I slipped. That's all.

589
00:24:06,212 --> 00:24:07,213
Is this your patient?

590
00:24:07,247 --> 00:24:08,715
Yeah. I saw him in the hallway.

591
00:24:08,749 --> 00:24:10,617
Brief LOC after he
slipped on some ice.

592
00:24:10,651 --> 00:24:12,485
‐ 'History of migraine.'
‐ It's not his only history.

593
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:14,521
‐ Why the hard restraints?
‐ I don't wanna cause trouble.

594
00:24:14,555 --> 00:24:16,657
Just...please, just
call my caseworker.

595
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:18,825
We will. Dr. Lewis.

596
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:21,528
Ca‐ca‐can you please just
get me out of this room?

597
00:24:21,562 --> 00:24:24,230
‐ Don't worry. We'll move you.
‐ What kind of caseworker?

598
00:24:24,264 --> 00:24:28,001
Psychiatric. He's monitoring
my conditional release.

599
00:24:28,034 --> 00:24:29,836
‐ He has the card.
‐ Release from where?

600
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,705
Dr. Lewis, now.

601
00:24:33,073 --> 00:24:35,108
Okay, two of IV Ativan,
five of Compazine

602
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:36,777
and a trauma panel.

603
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,812
'Someone call my, uh..'

604
00:24:38,845 --> 00:24:41,281
‐ He's schizophrenic.
‐ He's been here before?

605
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:44,250
He stabbed Carter and killed
a med student two years ago.

606
00:24:44,284 --> 00:24:45,752
‐ Him?
‐ Yeah.

607
00:24:45,786 --> 00:24:47,053
‐ He stabbed Carter?
‐ Yes.

608
00:24:47,087 --> 00:24:48,589
‐ What's he doing out?
‐ I don't know.

609
00:24:48,622 --> 00:24:50,023
The police are on
their way, but I think

610
00:24:50,056 --> 00:24:51,958
we should transfer him
before Carter sees him.

611
00:24:51,992 --> 00:24:54,628
‐ No. I need to get a CT.
‐ Let him get a CT at Mercy.

612
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:56,129
He has a head injury.

613
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:57,664
He stabbed two
people in that room‐‐

614
00:24:57,698 --> 00:24:58,832
Loss of consciousness
and he's vomiting‐‐

615
00:24:58,865 --> 00:25:00,033
And killed one of them.

616
00:25:00,066 --> 00:25:01,835
Abby, I'm not
transferring a man at risk

617
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:03,937
for an intracranial bleed.
I don't care what he did.

618
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,672
'Am I calling this
psychiatrist or not?'

619
00:25:05,706 --> 00:25:07,841
No. I'll call him.

620
00:25:07,874 --> 00:25:10,677
We'll find out his
status, we'll get the CT

621
00:25:10,711 --> 00:25:12,278
and then we'll take
it from there, okay?

622
00:25:12,312 --> 00:25:15,215
Abby, the morgue called.
They're ready for you.

623
00:25:15,248 --> 00:25:16,883
Move him to the suture room,
close the blinds.

624
00:25:16,917 --> 00:25:18,585
‐ Don't let Dr. Carter see him.
‐ 'I got it.'

625
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:20,554
And get his name off the board.

626
00:25:38,338 --> 00:25:40,641
She looks like Snow White.

627
00:25:50,917 --> 00:25:52,052
Mom.

628
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:54,621
Mom?

629
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:08,802
I drew you a picture.

630
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:36,296
'You took him to the morgue?'

631
00:26:36,329 --> 00:26:37,731
'He didn't believe
his mother was dead.'

632
00:26:37,764 --> 00:26:39,165
Well, then you call psych.

633
00:26:39,199 --> 00:26:42,068
Advice you might have
given yourself 18 hours ago.

634
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:44,004
Hey, hey, hey.
She vagaled in triage.

635
00:26:44,037 --> 00:26:45,739
No one even told me
she had a kid with her.

636
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:48,341
‐ Well, she did.
‐ Did you call social services?

637
00:26:48,374 --> 00:26:51,244
‐ Not yet.
‐ Why not? Abby, why not?

638
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:53,747
Because we're trying to
find another family member.

639
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,348
‐ Who's we?
‐ Uh‐uh, me.

640
00:26:55,381 --> 00:26:57,083
‐ That's not your job.
‐ I know.

641
00:26:57,117 --> 00:26:58,284
But I don't want him to go
to another strange place.

642
00:26:58,318 --> 00:26:59,986
Well, their holding facility

643
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,755
is a lot more comforting
than the ER or the morgue.

644
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:03,323
He'll keep being passed from one
stranger to another stranger.

645
00:27:03,356 --> 00:27:04,891
They have the personnel
and resources to deal with it.

646
00:27:04,925 --> 00:27:06,860
Call them now.

647
00:27:06,893 --> 00:27:08,161
'"You're honest, forthright'

648
00:27:08,194 --> 00:27:10,230
"and a judge, a good
judge of character.

649
00:27:10,263 --> 00:27:12,165
"You often ramble
incoherently when agitated.

650
00:27:12,198 --> 00:27:13,834
Even your dog
doesn't like you."

651
00:27:13,867 --> 00:27:16,269
‐ My dog died a year ago.
‐ It's a joke, Frank.

652
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:18,038
This amuses you?

653
00:27:18,071 --> 00:27:20,040
‐ Carter, what's your sign?
‐ Gemini, why?

654
00:27:20,073 --> 00:27:21,842
Oh, horoscopes
from the Internet.

655
00:27:21,875 --> 00:27:23,977
"You're open to new ideas,
compassionate, a risk‐taker‐‐"

656
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:25,411
That's true.

657
00:27:25,445 --> 00:27:26,947
"You tend to overstay
your welcome at parties

658
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,682
and you often
smell like cheese."

659
00:27:28,715 --> 00:27:29,883
Don't you have
some work to do?

660
00:27:29,916 --> 00:27:31,451
‐ Abby, your turn.
‐ No, thanks.

661
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:33,419
‐ What's your sign? Come on.
‐ Out of order.

662
00:27:33,453 --> 00:27:35,121
'Hey, who moved Libertique
out of the suture room?'

663
00:27:35,155 --> 00:27:38,024
The hand surgeon
is stuck in surgery

664
00:27:38,058 --> 00:27:39,760
for the next 40 minutes
and we needed the room

665
00:27:39,793 --> 00:27:40,994
for an extensor tendon repair.

666
00:27:41,027 --> 00:27:42,295
‐ Oh, I'll do that.
‐ No, no, no.

667
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:44,364
The‐the, uh, surgical
intern's got it.

668
00:27:44,397 --> 00:27:45,966
Can you take a look at this

669
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:48,802
ex...plosive watery diarrhea?

670
00:27:48,835 --> 00:27:51,304
‐ You need to start an IV?
‐ Maybe. I don't know.

671
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:53,974
He's...he's
pretty miserable.

672
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:56,309
‐ She.
‐ She.

673
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:59,045
‐ You okay?
‐ Yeah. Mm‐hmm.

674
00:28:02,482 --> 00:28:04,484
Abby, the light source
on the fiber‐optic is down.

675
00:28:04,518 --> 00:28:06,319
‐ Get me a spare?
‐ Okay.

676
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:07,954
'Can I see a doctor
this century?'

677
00:28:07,988 --> 00:28:09,222
Hang on.

678
00:28:09,255 --> 00:28:10,390
I hang on any longer,
I'll be dead.

679
00:28:10,423 --> 00:28:12,392
If you're talking,
you're not dying.

680
00:28:12,425 --> 00:28:14,795
He was found not guilty
by reason of insanity.

681
00:28:14,828 --> 00:28:16,797
Shouldn't he be in
a state forensic hospital?

682
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,799
He was, he was,
he was stepped down

683
00:28:18,832 --> 00:28:21,134
to a less restrictive
facility about ten months ago

684
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:24,170
and now he's on
conditional release.

685
00:28:24,204 --> 00:28:26,973
‐ 'Bradying down with 60.'
‐ Mig of atropine.

686
00:28:27,007 --> 00:28:28,308
‐ I need that scope.
‐ I've got it.

687
00:28:28,341 --> 00:28:30,010
Pulse ox 78.

688
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:32,412
'I need a smaller tube.
Number seven. Suction.'

689
00:28:32,445 --> 00:28:33,880
‐ He's agitated.
‐ He's nervous.

690
00:28:33,914 --> 00:28:35,248
The guy's been out
of board and care

691
00:28:35,281 --> 00:28:36,983
for less than a week,
he hits his head on some ice

692
00:28:37,017 --> 00:28:38,384
and the paramedics bring
him here of all places?

693
00:28:38,418 --> 00:28:41,454
‐ He‐he get out in two years?
‐ Who are you?

694
00:28:41,487 --> 00:28:44,090
I was working when
he attacked my friends.

695
00:28:44,124 --> 00:28:46,092
‐ I'm sorry.
‐ He was a law student.

696
00:28:46,126 --> 00:28:47,393
'A professor there
got some colleagues'

697
00:28:47,427 --> 00:28:49,029
to do some pro bono work.

698
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:51,798
They filed a writ of
habeas corpus and won.

699
00:28:51,832 --> 00:28:54,167
‐ That's u‐unbelievable.
‐ But I can't say I disagree.

700
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,069
Most schizophrenics
are non‐violent.

701
00:28:56,102 --> 00:28:57,971
Well, this one
was, wasn't he?

702
00:28:58,004 --> 00:29:00,406
And when they are,
they rarely are twice.

703
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,008
He's not a danger
to himself or others.

704
00:29:02,042 --> 00:29:03,544
‐ Really?
‐ 'Not on his meds.'

705
00:29:03,577 --> 00:29:05,245
There are safeguards
in place, he needs

706
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:07,147
to be supervised taking
his medication every day.

707
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,916
‐ Did he get his head CT?
‐ They're almost ready for him.

708
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:12,218
Abby, can you check this foley?
I think it's overflowing.

709
00:29:12,252 --> 00:29:14,788
‐ Clamp it.
‐ I did. It's overflowing.

710
00:29:14,821 --> 00:29:15,989
Just get him out of here.

711
00:29:16,022 --> 00:29:17,323
Anyway, I want those
restraints removed.

712
00:29:17,357 --> 00:29:19,993
‐ Uh, no.
‐ He is coherent and lucid.

713
00:29:20,026 --> 00:29:21,261
I have been working
with him for over a year.

714
00:29:21,294 --> 00:29:22,829
‐ No.
‐ Abby.

715
00:29:22,863 --> 00:29:25,065
‐ Susan, I swear to God, if‐‐
‐ Abby, I‐‐

716
00:29:25,098 --> 00:29:26,900
Keep somebody posted
outside his door.

717
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:28,468
But he needs reassurance
and respect right now.

718
00:29:28,501 --> 00:29:30,136
‐ Respect?
‐ Yes!

719
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:31,271
‐ I‐I'm sorry.
‐ 'Abby.'

720
00:29:31,304 --> 00:29:33,339
‐ He needs our respect?
‐ Abby, go.

721
00:29:39,513 --> 00:29:41,281
Looks like over a liter
in the last hour.

722
00:29:41,314 --> 00:29:43,517
Uh, BP's 110 over 70
and her sats are up.

723
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:46,086
Good. You need to send
out a repeat potassium.

724
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,988
Right. Thanks.

725
00:29:48,021 --> 00:29:49,956
He said something
about the ICU.

726
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:52,125
Um, yeah, maybe
for a couple of days.

727
00:29:52,158 --> 00:29:54,060
Just for safety.

728
00:29:54,094 --> 00:29:56,496
It's the fertility drugs, isn't
it, that's doing this to me?

729
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:59,099
The doctor has to,
uh, review your labs.

730
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:06,472
I could try to find
him now, if you like.

731
00:30:06,507 --> 00:30:09,510
‐ I'm sorry.
‐ It's okay.

732
00:30:09,543 --> 00:30:11,845
It must be the,
the damn hormones.

733
00:30:11,878 --> 00:30:14,014
‐ I'm not usually a crier.
‐ It's okay.

734
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:17,417
Thanks.

735
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:20,954
Sometimes being
a woman sucks, you know?

736
00:30:20,987 --> 00:30:24,124
It has its moments.

737
00:30:24,157 --> 00:30:26,426
You grow up praying you,
you don't get pregnant

738
00:30:26,459 --> 00:30:28,929
every time you have sex,
and then, when you finally

739
00:30:28,962 --> 00:30:31,031
do wanna have
a baby, you can't.

740
00:30:31,064 --> 00:30:33,099
It's so unfair.

741
00:30:33,133 --> 00:30:36,202
You've been trying
for a long time?

742
00:30:36,236 --> 00:30:39,573
I just keep thinking that maybe
I had my chance and I blew it.

743
00:30:39,606 --> 00:30:44,110
‐ You don't know that.
‐ No, I've been pregnant.

744
00:30:44,144 --> 00:30:46,379
A few years ago.
It was an accident.

745
00:30:46,412 --> 00:30:49,082
I had just started
a new job and this..

746
00:30:49,115 --> 00:30:51,585
...this new relationship.

747
00:30:51,618 --> 00:30:53,587
It didn't seem
like the right time.

748
00:30:54,655 --> 00:30:55,656
It happens.

749
00:30:55,689 --> 00:30:57,290
I only waited till I was ready

750
00:30:57,323 --> 00:31:00,060
so that I could be
the best mother I could be.

751
00:31:01,928 --> 00:31:04,565
I'm sure you're going to be.

752
00:31:04,598 --> 00:31:06,533
Unless I waited too long.

753
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,449
‐ 'Weaver's looking for you.'
‐ What?

754
00:31:23,483 --> 00:31:24,618
She wants to know
why you didn't call

755
00:31:24,651 --> 00:31:26,319
family services on that boy.

756
00:31:26,352 --> 00:31:27,688
I am. I will.

757
00:31:27,721 --> 00:31:29,022
I..

758
00:31:34,661 --> 00:31:36,096
'I'm gonna check
in with my office'

759
00:31:36,129 --> 00:31:37,964
and get some release paperwork.

760
00:31:37,998 --> 00:31:40,033
‐ I'll be right back.
‐ Okay.

761
00:31:47,007 --> 00:31:49,510
The on‐call social worker
for the ER, please.

762
00:31:49,543 --> 00:31:52,278
‐ 'Did someone claim 'em?'
‐ What?

763
00:31:52,312 --> 00:31:55,516
‐ The tickets.
‐ Oh. No.

764
00:31:55,549 --> 00:31:57,283
Lewis was asking for one.

765
00:31:57,317 --> 00:31:58,519
Muah.

766
00:31:58,552 --> 00:31:59,686
Thank you!

767
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,455
No, just have him paged. Thanks.

768
00:32:02,488 --> 00:32:04,257
Abby, when you get
a chance, I need

769
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:06,226
a thick‐and‐thin smear
and a culture in Curtain Three.

770
00:32:06,259 --> 00:32:07,293
Yeah.

771
00:32:07,327 --> 00:32:08,529
Oh, and your
diarrhea patient was

772
00:32:08,562 --> 00:32:09,696
heme‐negative.
Just a little PO‐challenged.

773
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:11,397
So, I sent him home
with some Imodium.

774
00:32:11,431 --> 00:32:14,034
Carter, I have a five‐year‐old
with abdominal pain

775
00:32:14,067 --> 00:32:16,269
and I'm‐I'm worried
about intussusception.

776
00:32:16,302 --> 00:32:17,971
Is there any
blood in the stool?

777
00:32:18,004 --> 00:32:19,706
No, but he had
a, a palpable mass.

778
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,341
‐ 'There he is.'
‐ 'Hey, sweetheart.'

779
00:32:21,374 --> 00:32:23,577
‐ 'There's daddy.'
‐ 'Hey...muah!'

780
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,979
'Hey. Hi.'

781
00:32:26,012 --> 00:32:28,448
‐ 'I'm okay. I'm okay.'
‐ Carter..

782
00:32:28,481 --> 00:32:30,584
'Daddy slipped and fell and'

783
00:32:30,617 --> 00:32:33,286
'and he hit his head,
but I'm okay.'

784
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:34,721
‐ 'They put you in restraints?'
‐ 'Yeah.'

785
00:32:34,755 --> 00:32:36,156
'It's just a precaution.'

786
00:32:36,189 --> 00:32:37,991
'They're a little paranoid.'

787
00:32:42,395 --> 00:32:44,164
Oh, it's you.

788
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,168
I'm sorry.

789
00:32:48,201 --> 00:32:49,703
What happened?
What's he doing here?

790
00:32:49,736 --> 00:32:52,205
He slipped and fell
outside his office building.

791
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,475
His office building?

792
00:32:55,509 --> 00:32:57,443
He's on conditional release.

793
00:32:59,045 --> 00:33:01,481
‐ You're out?
‐ I'm better.

794
00:33:01,515 --> 00:33:03,416
I'm sorry.

795
00:33:03,449 --> 00:33:05,752
'That wasn't me
who did that to you'

796
00:33:05,786 --> 00:33:08,722
to your friend.
You know that, right?

797
00:33:08,755 --> 00:33:10,724
You're a doctor.
You know it's a disease.

798
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:14,260
'I'm being treated.'

799
00:33:15,095 --> 00:33:17,197
I'm okay now.

800
00:33:21,134 --> 00:33:23,637
Great. I'm glad you're okay.

801
00:34:02,475 --> 00:34:03,443
I think I'm
starting to get it.

802
00:34:03,476 --> 00:34:04,444
Although that little puck

803
00:34:04,477 --> 00:34:06,079
is‐is hard to keep track of.

804
00:34:06,112 --> 00:34:08,649
They should give it a color
so your eye can follow it.

805
00:34:08,682 --> 00:34:10,183
‐ What, the puck?
‐ Yes.

806
00:34:10,216 --> 00:34:12,252
I mean, like
bright pink or red

807
00:34:12,285 --> 00:34:14,320
or flashing
lights or something.

808
00:34:14,354 --> 00:34:16,389
Okay, a flashing pink puck.

809
00:34:16,422 --> 00:34:17,858
‐ Why not?
‐ 'Cause it's hockey.'

810
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:20,661
It's gonna be a great game.
I love.. I love the Hawks.

811
00:34:20,694 --> 00:34:21,828
You got the tickets.

812
00:34:23,564 --> 00:34:27,100
‐ Hey, hey, what's wrong?
‐ Uh, nothing.

813
00:34:27,133 --> 00:34:28,702
‐ I hugged him.
‐ You what?

814
00:34:28,735 --> 00:34:30,637
Oh, yeah, I'm
the Bruce Lee of love, girl!

815
00:34:35,275 --> 00:34:36,677
Maybe I just need
some fresh air.

816
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:40,346
Hold, hold...wait
a minute. You're not out.

817
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,282
‐ Huh? Who are you hiding from?
‐ I'm not hiding.

818
00:34:42,315 --> 00:34:44,217
Wait a minute, well,
then what the heck was that?

819
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,719
You don't want your
friends to see us together?

820
00:34:45,752 --> 00:34:47,821
They're not my friends.
They work for me.

821
00:34:47,854 --> 00:34:50,356
How do you think
that makes me feel?

822
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:52,458
‐ I'm sorry.
‐ You came on to me.

823
00:34:52,492 --> 00:34:55,829
‐ You are not out.
‐ I am not out at work.

824
00:34:55,862 --> 00:34:57,731
‐ Well, you need to be.
‐ Sandy..

825
00:34:57,764 --> 00:35:00,366
I'm sorry. I don't
got time for this.

826
00:35:04,805 --> 00:35:06,807
‐ Okay.
‐ 'And I'll come straight..'

827
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,874
Okay.

828
00:35:09,275 --> 00:35:10,476
Bye, dad.

829
00:35:10,511 --> 00:35:12,445
‐ He'll be here tomorrow.
‐ Great.

830
00:35:13,814 --> 00:35:15,415
Have you ever been
to Los Angeles?

831
00:35:15,448 --> 00:35:18,184
‐ Once. Disneyland.
‐ Oh.

832
00:35:18,218 --> 00:35:20,754
I think you'll like it
there, 'cause it's sunny.

833
00:35:21,722 --> 00:35:23,657
Not cold like it is here.

834
00:35:27,427 --> 00:35:29,129
Excuse me.

835
00:35:30,597 --> 00:35:32,465
Can you give this
to Dr. Carter?

836
00:35:32,498 --> 00:35:34,267
I think you'd better do that.

837
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,402
Well, th‐they're
discharging Paul.

838
00:35:36,436 --> 00:35:38,438
I have to drive him home.

839
00:35:41,374 --> 00:35:44,477
They wouldn't have released
him if he weren't better.

840
00:35:44,511 --> 00:35:47,881
He's taking his meds.
He's in therapy.

841
00:35:47,914 --> 00:35:50,250
He has a disease,
but it's being treated.

842
00:35:50,283 --> 00:35:51,818
'I mean, that's
what you do here.'

843
00:35:51,852 --> 00:35:53,319
'You treat disease so people'

844
00:35:53,353 --> 00:35:54,721
'can try to move on with life.'

845
00:35:54,755 --> 00:35:56,790
Yeah.

846
00:35:56,823 --> 00:35:59,693
He's my husband.
We're his family.

847
00:36:00,827 --> 00:36:02,796
I can't give up on him.

848
00:36:03,864 --> 00:36:05,899
Good luck.

849
00:36:19,746 --> 00:36:20,847
Hey.

850
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:27,387
Um, Lewis
discharged Sobriki

851
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,422
and his wife asked
me to give you this.

852
00:36:30,957 --> 00:36:33,393
Guess you couldn't protect
me from her either, huh?

853
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:38,632
Uh, yeah, I'm
sorry about that‐‐

854
00:36:38,665 --> 00:36:40,967
‐ Don't worry, forget it.
‐ I just, I..

855
00:36:42,468 --> 00:36:43,704
Are you off already?

856
00:36:43,737 --> 00:36:44,871
Half shift.

857
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,942
I'm off in a half hour if you
want to get something to eat.

858
00:36:48,975 --> 00:36:51,578
I should get home.

859
00:36:51,612 --> 00:36:53,814
Or maybe just..

860
00:36:53,847 --> 00:36:56,282
...coffee and pie?

861
00:36:56,316 --> 00:36:58,418
I had a pretty
crappy day myself.

862
00:37:00,587 --> 00:37:01,655
Gammy just got out of
the convalescent hospital.

863
00:37:01,688 --> 00:37:02,689
I should go home
and check on her.

864
00:37:02,723 --> 00:37:03,724
Are you going to be okay?

865
00:37:03,757 --> 00:37:06,527
Yeah, I'm going to be fine.

866
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,762
Thank you for asking.

867
00:37:08,795 --> 00:37:10,363
'Any time.'

868
00:37:14,768 --> 00:37:16,603
‐ No!
‐ I have a real nice place‐‐

869
00:37:16,637 --> 00:37:18,939
‐ No. I wanna stay here!
‐ But you can't, Douglas.

870
00:37:18,972 --> 00:37:20,541
‐ Abby!
‐ Douglas, Douglas.

871
00:37:20,574 --> 00:37:22,375
I want, I want to stay here.

872
00:37:22,408 --> 00:37:24,010
I know. But this
is a hospital.

873
00:37:24,044 --> 00:37:26,012
And you have to go someplace
where you can get some sleep.

874
00:37:26,046 --> 00:37:28,281
‐ No.
‐ 'And get something to eat'

875
00:37:28,314 --> 00:37:30,517
‐ 'And maybe take a bath.'
‐ I'll stay with you!

876
00:37:30,551 --> 00:37:32,819
‐ Douglas, I don't‐‐
‐ No!

877
00:37:32,853 --> 00:37:34,555
I don't stay here
all the time, honey

878
00:37:34,588 --> 00:37:37,057
but you can come visit me
whenever you want, okay?

879
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,725
‐ I promise.
‐ No.

880
00:37:38,759 --> 00:37:40,293
‐ I've got you.
‐ Abby!

881
00:37:40,326 --> 00:37:42,328
‐ 'Come on.'
‐ 'Abby!'

882
00:37:42,362 --> 00:37:43,496
'We'll get you some
ice cream when we get there.'

883
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:44,698
You'll be fine, Douglas.

884
00:37:44,731 --> 00:37:46,700
Wait! I'll stay with you!

885
00:37:46,733 --> 00:37:49,770
Abby! Please! Abby!

886
00:37:58,645 --> 00:38:01,447
Abby, my cellulitis patient
is allergic to penicillin.

887
00:38:01,481 --> 00:38:02,883
‐ No.
‐ Can you give IV erythromycin?

888
00:38:02,916 --> 00:38:03,917
‐ No.
‐ 'What about vancomycin?'

889
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,886
No! I'm not your attending.

890
00:38:05,919 --> 00:38:08,021
I'm not a resident.
I'm a nurse.

891
00:38:08,054 --> 00:38:09,723
You want me
to assess a patient

892
00:38:09,756 --> 00:38:12,458
you want me to push meds,
you want me to check vitals

893
00:38:12,492 --> 00:38:15,361
explain a situation to
a family member, that's fine.

894
00:38:15,395 --> 00:38:17,463
What I will not do is carry
you through med school.

895
00:38:17,497 --> 00:38:19,566
You wanna be a doctor?
Start acting like one.

896
00:38:22,002 --> 00:38:24,304
Rachel, can I talk to you?

897
00:39:07,648 --> 00:39:10,817
‐ 'What are you doing?'
‐ Just picking your stuff up.

898
00:39:10,851 --> 00:39:13,086
‐ You're searching my room.
‐ It's a pigsty.

899
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,421
That doesn't give you the right
to go through my things.

900
00:39:17,558 --> 00:39:19,826
You mean these things?

901
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,494
I can't believe you did this!

902
00:39:21,528 --> 00:39:23,429
Are you smoking now?
I asked you a question.

903
00:39:23,463 --> 00:39:25,465
Hey, Rachel!
Are these your cigarettes?

904
00:39:25,498 --> 00:39:27,167
I bought that pack like
a month ago on a dare.

905
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,869
‐ A dare?
‐ To see if I could pass for 18.

906
00:39:28,902 --> 00:39:30,170
And the condoms?
What kind of a dare is that?

907
00:39:30,203 --> 00:39:31,471
They gave those
out in health class.

908
00:39:31,505 --> 00:39:32,573
And you decided to keep them?

909
00:39:32,606 --> 00:39:33,840
Why? You'd rather
I not have them?

910
00:39:33,874 --> 00:39:35,441
‐ You need to stop lying!
‐ Why?

911
00:39:35,475 --> 00:39:36,810
You don't believe me
anyway, you search my room

912
00:39:36,843 --> 00:39:37,844
and go through
my private things.

913
00:39:37,878 --> 00:39:39,913
I was looking for drugs.

914
00:39:41,214 --> 00:39:42,649
You said you
were picking up!

915
00:39:42,683 --> 00:39:44,117
‐ Who's lying now?
‐ You're right!

916
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,752
The truth is I was
searching your room

917
00:39:45,786 --> 00:39:48,088
because I don't know
if I can trust you.

918
00:39:48,121 --> 00:39:50,090
Then fine! Believe
whatever you want.

919
00:39:50,123 --> 00:39:53,193
I'm smoking! I'm on drugs!
And I'm having sex!

920
00:39:53,226 --> 00:39:54,828
'Lots of sex with lots of guys'

921
00:39:54,861 --> 00:39:57,463
'cause I'm the school
slut. You happy?

922
00:40:12,078 --> 00:40:13,547
Yes, this is John Carter.

923
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,115
I have a private duty
nurse for my grandmother

924
00:40:15,148 --> 00:40:17,483
who was supposed to start today.

925
00:40:17,518 --> 00:40:18,852
She's not here.

926
00:40:18,885 --> 00:40:20,587
Yeah.

927
00:40:20,621 --> 00:40:23,524
‐ 'I sent her home early.'
‐ What?

928
00:40:23,557 --> 00:40:26,026
She was aggravating Millicent
so I sent her home early.

929
00:40:26,059 --> 00:40:28,995
She'll be back at 6 a. m.

930
00:40:29,029 --> 00:40:30,797
It's a 24‐hour service.

931
00:40:30,831 --> 00:40:32,966
I'll get up...
if there's a problem.

932
00:40:34,835 --> 00:40:37,538
‐ What are you doing?
‐ Pardon?

933
00:40:37,571 --> 00:40:39,906
I mean, you show up
unannounced, uninvited.

934
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:40,941
Uninvited?

935
00:40:40,974 --> 00:40:41,975
And now you're making

936
00:40:42,008 --> 00:40:43,610
health care decisions?

937
00:40:43,644 --> 00:40:45,779
Your grandmother asked
me to ask her to leave.

938
00:40:45,812 --> 00:40:47,147
‐ I was trying to be helpful.
‐ Well, do me a favor.

939
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,248
Don't try to be helpful.

940
00:40:48,281 --> 00:40:50,751
It's not one of
your strong suits.

941
00:40:50,784 --> 00:40:52,519
Excuse me, John.

942
00:40:52,553 --> 00:40:54,888
I've had enough abuse
from my mother‐in‐law today.

943
00:40:54,921 --> 00:40:56,790
I don't need any
more from my son.

944
00:40:56,823 --> 00:40:58,525
I'm sorry?

945
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:00,627
I'm sorry, but I have
helped gamma through this.

946
00:41:00,661 --> 00:41:02,162
I have tended
to her medical needs.

947
00:41:02,195 --> 00:41:04,230
I have made her
health care arrangements.

948
00:41:04,264 --> 00:41:05,899
So you need
to consult with me

949
00:41:05,932 --> 00:41:07,734
before you do
anything like this.

950
00:41:07,768 --> 00:41:09,202
‐ Fine.
‐ Call them back.

951
00:41:09,235 --> 00:41:10,704
Yeah, you bet I will.

952
00:41:10,737 --> 00:41:12,706
But I'm not
leaving this house.

953
00:41:12,739 --> 00:41:14,174
And I don't care
if I'm uninvited.

954
00:41:14,207 --> 00:41:16,777
I'm not going to let your
father break up this family.

955
00:41:18,044 --> 00:41:20,013
Family, huh? What
family would that be?

956
00:41:20,046 --> 00:41:21,281
Don't be sarcastic.

957
00:41:21,314 --> 00:41:23,650
You checked out of
this family 20 years ago.

958
00:41:25,586 --> 00:41:27,253
‐ Excuse me. I'm going to bed.
‐ No.

959
00:41:27,287 --> 00:41:29,289
I'm not gonna let you put
some kind of revisionist spin

960
00:41:29,322 --> 00:41:31,124
on this with you as
the injured party, no.

961
00:41:31,157 --> 00:41:33,960
‐ Step aside.
‐ No, I got stabbed!

962
00:41:33,994 --> 00:41:36,496
I got stabbed in the back!
Where the hell were you?

963
00:41:38,298 --> 00:41:40,133
You were the same place that
you've been my entire life!

964
00:41:40,166 --> 00:41:41,735
You were someplace else!

965
00:41:41,768 --> 00:41:43,604
‐ We came back.
‐ Three weeks later.

966
00:41:43,637 --> 00:41:45,639
We were stuck in Tokyo
and you said you were fine.

967
00:41:45,672 --> 00:41:47,674
Well, I wasn't fine
and it wasn't okay.

968
00:41:49,142 --> 00:41:51,111
Are you gonna blame
me for taking drugs?

969
00:41:51,144 --> 00:41:54,515
No, I am blaming you
for not being my mother!

970
00:42:00,053 --> 00:42:02,789
Bobby died.

971
00:42:02,823 --> 00:42:04,758
And I lost a mother.

972
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:12,132
May I go to bed now?

973
00:42:26,813 --> 00:42:28,281
Yeah, run away.

974
00:42:56,943 --> 00:42:58,645
Oh, God!

975
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,214
Thank you.

976
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,916
Gotta call the super
about that too.

977
00:43:02,949 --> 00:43:05,118
It gets stuck in the cold.

978
00:43:05,151 --> 00:43:08,021
And I'm guessing it's going
to stay cold for a while.

979
00:43:08,054 --> 00:43:10,991
‐ Hopefully not this cold.
‐ 'Good.'

980
00:43:11,024 --> 00:43:13,226
I told Brian January
wasn't the best time to move

981
00:43:13,259 --> 00:43:15,261
but that's when
the semester starts.

982
00:43:15,295 --> 00:43:18,331
‐ 'He's in law school.'
‐ Did you get locked out?

983
00:43:18,364 --> 00:43:21,768
We had a fight...
so I went to the store.

984
00:43:21,802 --> 00:43:23,870
Another half hour,
he'll be asleep.

985
00:43:26,306 --> 00:43:28,742
Are you from Chicago?

986
00:43:28,775 --> 00:43:30,243
For a while now, yeah.

987
00:43:30,276 --> 00:43:32,245
'Originally?'

988
00:43:32,278 --> 00:43:34,280
Minnesota. You?

989
00:43:34,314 --> 00:43:37,350
Idaho. The potato part,
not the white supremacist part.

990
00:43:38,418 --> 00:43:39,419
'You want a beer?'

991
00:43:39,452 --> 00:43:40,654
No, thanks.

992
00:43:40,687 --> 00:43:42,656
Come on. Have a seat.

993
00:43:42,689 --> 00:43:44,625
You look like
you've had a long day.

994
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:51,397
Thank you.

995
00:43:59,139 --> 00:44:01,107
Mm, you got a card.

996
00:44:02,308 --> 00:44:04,811
Mm‐hmm.

997
00:44:04,845 --> 00:44:06,880
'It's nice to get one
personal piece of mail'

998
00:44:06,913 --> 00:44:09,149
'mixed in with all
the bills and junk.'

999
00:44:09,983 --> 00:44:12,753
Your birthday?

1000
00:44:12,786 --> 00:44:15,021
‐ Huh?
‐ Is it your birthday?

1001
00:44:15,055 --> 00:44:17,323
‐ Yes.
‐ 'Today?'

1002
00:44:17,357 --> 00:44:20,961
Mm‐hmm. 8:03 p. m.

1003
00:44:20,994 --> 00:44:23,329
'Well, congratulations.
You've made it.'

1004
00:44:23,363 --> 00:44:25,131
Happy birthday.

1005
00:44:26,266 --> 00:44:27,834
Thank you.
