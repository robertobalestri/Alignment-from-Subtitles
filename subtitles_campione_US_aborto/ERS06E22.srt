1
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:41,808
Three gunshots. One looks fatal.

2
00:00:41,842 --> 00:00:43,644
You should have let us
land ten minutes ago.

3
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:45,712
Suspect was pinned down.
He was still firing.

4
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:47,113
He was shooting at the school?

5
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:48,515
They were shooting everywhere.

6
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:50,684
A unit responded to
armored truck robbery.

7
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,118
The suspects opened fire.

8
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:53,353
I'll take this one.

9
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,454
Where are my glasses?

10
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:56,289
Where are my glasses?

11
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:58,158
‐ Is he alert?
‐ Sort of.

12
00:00:58,191 --> 00:00:59,425
Name's Daniel.

13
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:01,762
Daniel, do you know
where you are?

14
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,129
I lost my glasses.

15
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:04,631
Can you tell me where you are.

16
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:06,099
School.

17
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:07,601
Exit wound out the right temple.

18
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:09,469
What kind of ammunition
were they using?

19
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:11,471
One had a large caliber
assault rifle

20
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:13,206
to shoot through
the engine block.

21
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,876
We'll never get her back
with a head wound like that.

22
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,611
Stop compressions.

23
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,185
My dad..

24
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:26,753
Somebody call my dad!

25
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:28,254
I'm Dr. Kovac.
What's your name?

26
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:29,422
Nicholas.

27
00:01:29,455 --> 00:01:31,625
Take a deep breath, Nicholas.

28
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:32,826
Could you call my dad?

29
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:35,128
Vinny Rosato.
He works at Covin.

30
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:37,497
312‐54..

31
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:38,732
How's he doing?

32
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,266
Chest is clear,
good radial pulse.

33
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,401
Titrate four of morphine.

34
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:44,304
54... 548.

35
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:45,639
'Don't worry.'

36
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:47,340
'I'm sure the school has it.'

37
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:48,909
That could take a while
we're evacuating

38
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,143
out of the front
of the building.

39
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:51,177
Why?

40
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:52,779
We've apprehended two suspects.

41
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:54,648
There might be another one.

42
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,349
Might be?

43
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:57,818
'Can you feel your leg?'

44
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:58,852
'Kind of.'

45
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:00,286
It's like going to sleep.

46
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,822
‐ Like, pins and needles?
‐ Yeah.

47
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:03,323
Where are the paramedics?

48
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:04,457
We're wavin' them through.

49
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,526
You got any ancef?

50
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:06,860
Red bag, side pocket.

51
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:08,529
Is yours stable by ground?

52
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:09,930
He should be, bullet fragment
missed the brain.

53
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,397
What about yours?

54
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:12,599
'Clean through the shoulder'

55
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:13,634
But, there's one to the groin

56
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:14,935
with a cold foot.

57
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,269
Ah, we've got to
revascularize within..

58
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,371
Okay, clear out.

59
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:19,940
‐ What?
‐ Go! Now!

60
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,274
He's in the building,
comin' out!

61
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:30,711
'Let me examine him.'

62
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:32,713
We have to search him first.

63
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:34,347
Is he still breathing?

64
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,016
Yeah, he's clear.

65
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,618
Alright, come ahead.

66
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:39,019
You shot him through the vest?

67
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,754
‐ Right chest.
‐ Alright, BP?

68
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,255
Sir, I'm a doctor,
I'm here to help.

69
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:43,624
‐ Can you talk?
‐ Go to hell.

70
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:45,859
Okay, I'll take that as a yes.

71
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,427
Diminished breath sounds
on the right.

72
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,696
BP's 100 over 65.
His pulse is at 88.

73
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,431
Alright, let's get
a large‐bore IV.

74
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:52,999
And let's roll him.

75
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:55,502
No exit wound.
Alright, he needs a chest tube.

76
00:03:55,536 --> 00:03:57,437
Let's get betadine
and steri‐drape

77
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,705
and take that mask off him.

78
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,273
‐ 'You got this?'
‐ Yeah. Lidocaine.

79
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:01,542
I'm sending the eye
by ambulance

80
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,376
and taking the leg
in the chopper.

81
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,345
Hold on, hold on I might need
to fly this guy. Ten blade.

82
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:06,880
No room. Take him by ground.

83
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,414
Hold on, I just want to make
sure he's stable.

84
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:09,683
You can bring him to Mercy.

85
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:11,718
County's the closest
pediatric trauma center.

86
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,554
Just wait until I get
the chest tube in.

87
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:14,955
Alright, 32 French, come on.

88
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,356
Chris, take two units

89
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:17,924
of O‐neg from the cooler
in the chopper.

90
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,025
I'm loading my kid.

91
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:20,326
I said wait!

92
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,427
Kovac!

93
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,329
The suspect is apparently alive.

94
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,298
We are waiting
for confirmation on that.

95
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:26,800
If you are just joining us

96
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,970
this is a live shot
of Phalen elementary school.

97
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,004
Is that Dr. Kovac?

98
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:32,405
I dunno, it's hard to say.

99
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:33,874
No, he's too short to be Kovac.

100
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:35,441
Has anyone seen the tool kit?

101
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,477
‐ What tool kit?
‐ The do‐it‐yourself kit.

102
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:39,513
The one with the hammer,
pliers, screwdriver.

103
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:40,714
What are you gonna do
build a tree house?

104
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,348
I got a guy
who drilled a wood screw

105
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:43,850
into his tibia
with a power drill.

106
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:44,885
Somebody gonna get that?

107
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:47,053
Thanks, Abby.

108
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:48,522
What are you guys watching?

109
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:49,556
Where have you been?

110
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,591
A shooting near a school.

111
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,058
Weaver sent Benton and Kovac.

112
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:54,094
Hmm, why'd they get to go?

113
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,029
Because they don't
get sick in the chopper.

114
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:58,398
Hey, I already told you
I had the flu, okay.

115
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,967
I got it.

116
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:03,003
What are you going to do
take it out with a screwdriver?

117
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,038
Yeah, You got a better idea?

118
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:07,841
MVA comin' in, single auto
versus parking structure.

119
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:09,876
‐ ETA?
‐ Five to ten.

120
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,545
Alright, get Weaver.
I'll meet you in trauma two.

121
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:12,913
Hey, hey, why do you get it?

122
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:15,716
I'll call you
if he needs his oil changed.

123
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:17,350
The drive might be faster
with morning traffic.

124
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:18,585
It's your call.

125
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:19,786
Hold on. Pulse
is weak and thready.

126
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,821
Hey, man, are you still with me?

127
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:21,955
Heart rate's up to 120.

128
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,757
The chest output's over 500cc's.

129
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,925
He's bleeding out
through his chest.

130
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:25,959
Spike a unit of o‐neg.

131
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,528
BP's down to 70 palp.

132
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:29,029
‐ Alright, follow me.
‐ But, where you going?

133
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,363
We'll transport by chopper.

134
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:32,866
Half liter bolus, then TKO.

135
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,400
‐ He's bleeding out.
‐ What?

136
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:35,702
The guy, the shooter,
he's bleeding out.

137
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:36,870
I need the chopper.

138
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:38,371
Where are we going
to put him?

139
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:39,573
We're gonna have to
take the boy off.

140
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:41,007
He has a pulseless leg.

141
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,076
Yeah, but we got five hours
to revascularize.

142
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:45,946
I'm not going to waste time
transporting by ground.

143
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:47,447
This guy's pressure's crashing!

144
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,682
Then, give him blood.

145
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:50,050
‐ C'mon, get out of the chopper!
‐ No way.

146
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,752
Look, my patient
is more critical.

147
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:53,620
Your patient killed people.

148
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:55,155
That's not our call.

149
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,758
Come on.

150
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:58,959
Close the door.

151
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:00,727
Let's go.

152
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:02,162
Kovac, open up the door!

153
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,396
Stand back.

154
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:04,565
Open up the door!

155
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:05,899
Stand back!

156
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:17,844
‐ Ow! Ow! Ow!
‐ IV's in.

157
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,079
That's it, I'm out of here.

158
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:21,047
‐ Screw you!
‐ Oh, you're welcome.

159
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:22,849
‐ Thank you, Doris.
‐ Anytime.

160
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:23,917
What have you got, Carter?

161
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,652
A combative single MVA.

162
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:26,920
Ran into a parking lot booth.

163
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:28,021
Get this thing off my neck!

164
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,055
‐ Was anybody in it?
‐ No.

165
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:30,591
I can't breathe!

166
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:32,458
He's altered, tachy
and hypertensive.

167
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:33,660
He'll need a head CT.

168
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:34,695
Get this thing off!

169
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:35,796
Neck looks clear.

170
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:37,564
Okay, remove the collar.

171
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:38,732
BP's up, 200 over 100.

172
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:39,900
Okay, hold still.

173
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:41,201
‐ Get it off.
‐ That's what I'm doing.

174
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,470
Looks like a posterior
hip dislocation.

175
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:46,172
Alright, titrate
200 of fentanyl

176
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:47,841
'and six of versed.'

177
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,175
I'll reduce it.

178
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:50,744
‐ You might wanna look at this.
‐ What's wrong?

179
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,445
It's a goiter,
I think a big one.

180
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:53,914
That's one of versed

181
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:55,181
and 50 of fentanyl.

182
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:56,683
What are you doing?
Don't touch me!

183
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:57,984
Keep going.
He can take a little more.

184
00:06:58,018 --> 00:06:59,886
Hey, did you notice
any hand tremors?

185
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,555
No, he was moving around
all over the place.

186
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:02,989
That's another 50 of fentanyl.

187
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:04,057
You thinking thyroid storm?

188
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,159
IV Inderal, 100 PTU.

189
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:07,728
'So, he's not on drugs?'

190
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,863
No, his thyroid is hyperactive.

191
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,798
I'm going to
kill someone, I swear.

192
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:13,634
'How much inderal?'

193
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,569
'Titrate a milligram'
every two minutes.'

194
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,137
Okay, he's out.

195
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,539
Have you ever reduced
a hip before?

196
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:19,706
No.

197
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,107
You just want
to stabilize the pelvis.

198
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:23,009
No, from above, up.

199
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:25,712
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yeah.

200
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:26,747
Alright, I'm
going to pull up.

201
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,148
On three.

202
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:30,984
One, two, three.

203
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:36,623
'Oh, my God!'

204
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:37,991
'Carter!'

205
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,560
Carter, are you alright?

206
00:07:39,593 --> 00:07:40,794
'Let me up, I wanna get up.'

207
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,128
Carter!

208
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:43,730
Push another two of versed.

209
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:44,998
Okay, somebody grab Malucci.
He can do this.

210
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:46,166
‐ I can do it.
‐ 'John, sit down.'

211
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,233
I said I can do it.

212
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:48,902
'Stay off me.'

213
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:50,971
‐ Is he out this time?
‐ Yeah, he's out.

214
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:52,906
I don't want you to
aggravate your injury.

215
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,007
Are you ready?

216
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,509
‐ You ready?
‐ Yeah.

217
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:57,711
Thank you, now maintain
downward pressure.

218
00:07:57,744 --> 00:07:58,745
Don't be gentle.

219
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:00,781
One, two, three.

220
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,886
Okay, I got it.

221
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,588
Femoral head is back in place.

222
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:08,889
Good job, Carter.

223
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,657
Ah, it's just like
fallin' off a horse.

224
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:12,659
'Heart rate's down to 110.'

225
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:13,694
Dr. Weaver.

226
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:15,696
Got a hot MI In curtain three.

227
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:17,664
‐ You got it from here?
‐ Hard part's over.

228
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:19,099
Let's get him up to radiology

229
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:21,668
and then we'll get
a post‐reduction film later.

230
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:23,136
'I'm sorry about that.'

231
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,239
Now you know. It takes a lot
of counter‐traction.

232
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:27,941
Hey, can you baby‐sit
him in radiology?

233
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,042
'Sure.'

234
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:30,176
Thank you.

235
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:05,278
'Did I leave his chart in here?'

236
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:10,083
Is it over on the mayo stand?

237
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:14,721
Uh...no.

238
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:16,222
Just cleanin' up.

239
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:17,624
Yeah.

240
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:19,926
There it is.

241
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,995
Over on the pulse ox.

242
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:23,897
‐ What?
‐ The chart is over there.

243
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,668
Thanks.

244
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:32,105
Oh, look at this, a needle
stick waiting to happen.

245
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:33,173
Can't be too careful.

246
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:35,175
That's right.

247
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,276
Hey, make sure they do a head

248
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:37,310
abdomen, and pelvis on that guy.

249
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:38,344
Sure.

250
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:39,713
And, come find me, hunt me down.

251
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,047
Let me see the films.

252
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,917
‐ Okay.
‐ Thanks.

253
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,886
‐ Yeah.
‐ 'Thank you.'

254
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,267
What's his last
pressure?

255
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:03,870
‐ Stable, 110 over 70.
‐ How is he?

256
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:06,072
GSW to the groin
with a pulseless leg.

257
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,140
What about the arm?

258
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:08,642
Through and through..

259
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:09,843
Does he have sensation
in the foot?

260
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:10,877
We're losing it.

261
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:12,779
I'm going to lose my leg?

262
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:14,715
Not if I have anything
to say about it.

263
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,818
Send burns for
a shoulder X‐ray.

264
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:20,153
Subramaniam needs
a dilantin level.

265
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:21,321
What the hell is that?

266
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,123
Mr. Goodwrench
is tunin' up a patient.

267
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:24,858
What?

268
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:26,126
You got to hold still, man.

269
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:27,227
Malucci, what are you doing?

270
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,261
Hey, boss.

271
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,295
Ah, you know what?

272
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:30,330
Let's take a break, okay?

273
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:31,898
‐ Okay.
‐ All good.

274
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:33,266
Guy drove the screw
into his leg.

275
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,300
Yeah, I can see that,
I think he needs

276
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:35,335
a little more lidocaine?

277
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,037
He won't even take an aspirin.

278
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,138
He says "it interferes with
the healing process."

279
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:39,172
Did you tell him he's wrong?

280
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,206
Yeah, the chief even tried

281
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,742
to talk sense into him.

282
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:43,309
Malucci, tell him if he wants
to be a masochist

283
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:44,444
he can't scream so much.

284
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,846
He's gonna scare
the other patients.

285
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,113
Right, right, I'll have him

286
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,049
bite down on a bullet
or something.

287
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:51,752
Carter, I hear you got punted
across the trauma room.

288
00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:52,886
Yeah? Who told you that?

289
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:53,920
I hear everything.

290
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:56,089
‐ Haleh?
‐ Yeah.

291
00:10:57,891 --> 00:10:59,459
‐ Malucci.
‐ I know.

292
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,027
So did you hurt yourself?

293
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:02,162
No, it just knocked
the wind out of me

294
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:03,229
but everything's working.

295
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:04,765
Another tough guy.

296
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:06,967
‐ Something rolling up?
‐ Rolling down.

297
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,935
It's the kid from the shooting.
I thought I might jump in.

298
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:10,270
Well, don't jump
off any gurneys.

299
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:11,772
Yes, sir.

300
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:13,006
So, did you call any
of those psych referrals?

301
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,040
What patient?

302
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:15,141
That list I gave you.

303
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,209
‐ Oh, yeah..
‐ Uh‐huh.

304
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,243
How'd it go?

305
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:19,946
Um, you know, okay, I guess.

306
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,014
It's kind of tough to tell.

307
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,282
Yeah, it could take a while.

308
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:24,317
'CBC, lytes, PT, PTT.'

309
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,086
Type and cross for two units.

310
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:27,153
Can we give more morphine?

311
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,989
Another four, and get

312
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,423
a chest X‐ray and pelvis.

313
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:31,457
You want ancef?

314
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:32,726
Gave it in the field.

315
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:33,760
Nicholas, we are just going to

316
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:34,795
take a look at you here

317
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:35,829
and then we'll bring you

318
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:36,863
upstairs for an operation, okay?

319
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:38,732
On my count, one, two, three.

320
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:40,033
Did they call my dad?

321
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:41,067
We'll take care of it.

322
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:42,202
Mary, call the police

323
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:43,236
the school or whoever

324
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,005
to reach his father at work.

325
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,239
It's been all over the news.

326
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:47,874
I'm sure his dad's
looking for him.

327
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:50,010
‐ Make sure.
‐ Got it.

328
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:53,279
Lungs are clear.
BP 115 over 75. Pulse 80.

329
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:55,448
Left inguinal entrance wound,
where's the exit?

330
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:56,917
Couldn't find one for the leg.

331
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,184
The bullet's still inside.

332
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,920
We should see it
on the pelvic film.

333
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:02,889
‐ No pulse by Doppler.
‐ Let's look at the back.

334
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:04,124
It's through and through,
missed everything.

335
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:05,826
I assessed it in the field.

336
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:07,794
I need to examine it myself.

337
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:10,230
Okay, let's roll him.

338
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:11,297
'Hold on, Nicholas.'

339
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:12,332
We need to move
you on your side

340
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:13,800
so we can look at your back.

341
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,471
‐ Carter?
‐ Carter.

342
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:19,806
Yeah, I got it.

343
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,607
'Let's roll.'

344
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:25,445
Did you hit your head
or pass out?

345
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,147
Of course I hit my head,
it's rugby.

346
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,549
Any pain in your chest
or your belly?

347
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:29,783
No, nothing.

348
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:30,817
I didn't want to come in

349
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:32,052
but the fellas made me.

350
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,253
Hey, hey, hey,
what are you doing?

351
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:34,287
Oh, we need to cut off
your shirt

352
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,889
so that we can examine you.

353
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,290
Like hell you do.
We just got these jerseys.

354
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,025
If you've broken your collarbone

355
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:41,261
it will be very painful to lift
your hands above your head.

356
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:42,896
Pain is relative, mate.

357
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,031
What was that?

358
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,203
someone who didn't want us
to cut off his shirt.

359
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:51,538
‐ Right.
‐ Okay, Abby?

360
00:12:51,572 --> 00:12:53,840
Abby, go ahead.

361
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:01,014
You are blue. Did you
know that, Mr. Tanner?

362
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:04,117
Yeah, it happens as soon as
you sweat in these new jerseys.

363
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,819
Well, maybe you should
wash them first.

364
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:07,954
It's brand‐new.

365
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:11,858
Okay, let me know
if you feel any pain.

366
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:12,926
'Uh, yeah, yeah.'

367
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,861
Probably a mid‐ shaft fracture.

368
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:16,462
Yeah, it looks like it's broken.

369
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:18,098
Will I be able to play
next week?

370
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,601
I doubt it, but we're going
to wait and see the x‐ray.

371
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:22,268
Be right back.

372
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,538
Abby?

373
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:26,272
‐ Get a clavicle film.
‐ Right.

374
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,440
Is everything okay?

375
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:31,578
‐ Yeah.
‐ Are you sure?

376
00:13:31,612 --> 00:13:32,946
Do you have a minute?

377
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,214
I don't see a bullet.

378
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:35,882
It must be higher up
in the abdomen.

379
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,217
Let's shoot a KUB.

380
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,852
Are you sure your
stomach doesn't hurt?

381
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:40,320
It's just my leg.

382
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:41,922
PVC's on the cardiac monitor.

383
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:43,223
Where's the chest X‐ray?

384
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:44,257
Whoa, run of five.

385
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,391
Bolus 60 of lidocaine.

386
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:46,492
'Start one per minute.'

387
00:13:46,527 --> 00:13:47,528
What is it?

388
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:48,895
Just an extra heartbeat.

389
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:49,963
Nothing to worry about.

390
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,164
You're not going
to believe this.

391
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:54,601
‐ 'What?'
‐ I found your bullet.

392
00:13:54,635 --> 00:13:56,336
Oh, God, it's in his heart.

393
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:57,871
'It traveled through
the femoral vein.'

394
00:13:57,904 --> 00:13:59,239
From there to the IVC.

395
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:01,241
Into the right atrium
and ventricle.

396
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:02,275
Lydia, call the OR.

397
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:03,910
Tell them we're on our way up.

398
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:05,512
Carter, make sure
there's an open cardiac room

399
00:14:05,546 --> 00:14:07,280
with a perfusionist standing by.

400
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:08,314
He may need a bypass.

401
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,583
I got it.

402
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:10,617
We're gonna have to
revascularize

403
00:14:10,651 --> 00:14:12,018
the leg at the same time.

404
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:13,353
Let's put him in
right lateral decubitus

405
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:14,655
reverse trendelenberg.

406
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,389
We don't want it
embolizing to the lung.

407
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,291
Nicholas, we need to move you
onto your side again.

408
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:19,359
What's wrong?

409
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:20,393
Remember I said

410
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:21,628
we would take you upstairs?

411
00:14:21,662 --> 00:14:22,896
Yeah.

412
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:24,297
Well, we are going now.

413
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,269
Hey.
Good effort.

414
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:33,073
18‐year‐old college student
mugged outside her dorm

415
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:34,174
stabbed in the lower abdomen.

416
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,241
Hey, Peter.

417
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:36,977
200cc's in the foley.

418
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,011
Type and cross for six units.

419
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,345
Have two of FFP on hand.

420
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:40,380
She's going to
fix you up, okay?

421
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:41,915
Hang in there, buddy.

422
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:43,617
‐ You'll get my dad?
‐ I'll get your dad.

423
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,686
'Send up the O‐neg
incase they need it.'

424
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,988
Hey, Peter, Elizabeth needs
another surgeon.

425
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:49,656
‐ Congratulations, he's dead.
‐ Who?

426
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,091
The man he abandoned
at the scene.

427
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:52,492
I didn't abandon him.

428
00:14:52,526 --> 00:14:54,595
He went into asystole five
minutes outside of Mercy.

429
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:56,162
They cracked him,
but it was too late.

430
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:57,330
And what? ten minutes would have
made a difference?

431
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:58,565
We won't know, will we?

432
00:14:58,599 --> 00:15:00,100
Hold on, are we talking
about the shooter?

433
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:02,135
First rule of triage,
"The most critical patient

434
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:03,369
"that's the priority."

435
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,938
The boy has a bullet
in his heart.

436
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:06,406
It can embolize at any minute

437
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:07,674
and he could lose his leg.

438
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,175
Let's debate this later,
Peter, get upstairs.

439
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:10,210
You didn't make
a medical judgment

440
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,277
I made both!

441
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:12,646
Upstairs, Peter!

442
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:13,680
He was crashing
and you didn't care, man!

443
00:15:13,714 --> 00:15:15,281
I was caring for the boy!

444
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:17,150
Hey, hey, hey! That's enough,
that's enough.

445
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,987
Kerry, I need to talk to you.

446
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:22,989
BP's 118 over78, pulse 84.

447
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:24,257
Can you describe the man
who stabbed you?

448
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,092
I‐I don't know,
it happened so fast.

449
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:28,494
Chuny, get an ultrasound and
a fetal monitor to trauma two.

450
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:29,730
Cleo, you need some help?

451
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,031
Yeah, I might.

452
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:32,198
Kerry, now, it's important.

453
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:33,466
You saw the boy.

454
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:34,568
He needed to get
to a trauma center.

455
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,069
Calm down.
Go help Cleo.

456
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,437
I'm supposed to delay care

457
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,471
while they take the guy who was

458
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:39,740
shooting at kids and cops?

459
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:41,041
Go help Cleo!

460
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:42,509
'One, two, three!'

461
00:15:42,543 --> 00:15:44,344
Can you give me any kinda
physical description?

462
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:47,480
He was, um, darker,
maybe Mexican.

463
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:49,115
‐ What is it?
‐ Victim of assault.

464
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:52,452
Single right stab wound
to the lower right quadrant

465
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:54,254
four centimeters
off the midline.

466
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,355
What was he wearing?

467
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:57,591
A gray sweatshirt, I think.

468
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:59,159
Okay, a full trauma panel

469
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:00,460
and check a hemocue.

470
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:02,495
How far along are you, miss?

471
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:03,630
What?

472
00:16:03,664 --> 00:16:05,566
What month are you in?

473
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:07,067
‐ What do you mean?
‐ Your pregnancy.

474
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,234
When are you due?

475
00:16:08,268 --> 00:16:10,036
I'm not pregnant.

476
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:13,306
You look about eight months.

477
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:15,576
‐ Got the ultrasound.
‐ Better cath a urine.

478
00:16:15,609 --> 00:16:17,410
Anything else you can
tell me about the attack?

479
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:20,313
No, he‐he just ran up,
grabbed my purse.

480
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,448
When I didn't let go
he stabbed me.

481
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,150
'Okay, I'll be back.'

482
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:25,752
'Fetal heart tones are 142.'

483
00:16:25,786 --> 00:16:27,554
'Hemocue's 13.4.'

484
00:16:27,588 --> 00:16:29,255
No intraabdominal
bleed on mom.

485
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:30,524
How about the baby?

486
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:33,326
32‐week size,
good cardiac activity.

487
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:34,595
I'm pregnant?

488
00:16:34,628 --> 00:16:36,763
‐ Very.
‐ Oh, my God.

489
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:40,200
‐ Hold on.
‐ What?

490
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:41,535
There. A blood clot.

491
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:43,036
Abruption?

492
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:44,437
Could be.

493
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,707
12 milligrams
of betamethasone, now.

494
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,042
You can't tell my parents.

495
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:50,110
What's your name?

496
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:52,178
G‐Gloria... Gloria Milton.

497
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:54,681
Gloria, the stab wound
has damaged the placenta

498
00:16:54,715 --> 00:16:56,316
causing it to bleed

499
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,084
which would cut off
oxygen to your baby.

500
00:16:58,118 --> 00:16:59,385
I didn't even know I had a baby.

501
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:01,387
'Well, you do.'

502
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:03,524
Right now, it looks okay,
but we may need

503
00:17:03,557 --> 00:17:05,592
to bring you upstairs
for a C‐section.

504
00:17:05,626 --> 00:17:07,528
You mean, cut me open?

505
00:17:07,561 --> 00:17:09,262
Yes, 32 weeks is early

506
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:10,731
but we are giving
you steroids now

507
00:17:10,764 --> 00:17:12,332
to help mature the baby's lungs.

508
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,800
No, wait!
I‐I don't want an operation.

509
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:15,536
You might not have a choice.

510
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:18,138
If the abruption continues,
the baby will die.

511
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:21,107
But nothing bad will happen
to me, right?

512
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:22,543
Right now,
you're alright, but‐‐

513
00:17:22,576 --> 00:17:23,677
Then, don't.

514
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,145
Don't cut me open.

515
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:26,479
Don't do anything.

516
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:31,752
Hey, it's Dr. Torquemada.

517
00:17:31,785 --> 00:17:32,786
Who?

518
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:33,854
Nothing.

519
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:35,756
You discharge your screamer yet?

520
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:37,423
He was pretty tough, Carter.

521
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:38,625
You, couldn't tell that
from out here.

522
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:40,360
He took on the hurt
and won, my friend.

523
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:41,394
You got to respect that.

524
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:42,663
Right, no brain, no pain.

525
00:17:42,696 --> 00:17:45,231
Some cultures see pain
as a right of passage.

526
00:17:46,867 --> 00:17:48,602
Well, somebody call
a staff meeting?

527
00:17:48,635 --> 00:17:51,437
No.

528
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:53,540
Hey, you know the kid
made it up to the OR okay.

529
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:55,576
Cardiac team's in,
Benton's workin' on the leg.

530
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:57,277
Good, thanks.

531
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,313
At age 13, the Masai warriors
of Tanzania scar themselves

532
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:03,383
with red hot spears and yank out
their bottom front teeth

533
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,417
with no novocaine, mind you.

534
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,786
Hmm.

535
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:07,521
Hey, Dave, why don't
you give us a minute?

536
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:09,355
Oh, yeah, sure, sorry.

537
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:11,324
Carter, hold on.

538
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:17,197
‐ What's up?
‐ I think you know.

539
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,532
Ah, look at that.
The guy leaves, like

540
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:20,500
a millimeter of coffee
in the bottom of the pot.

541
00:18:21,702 --> 00:18:23,236
Abby saw you.

542
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,471
She saw me what?

543
00:18:25,506 --> 00:18:27,307
Abby.

544
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:29,409
I saw you inject the fentanyl

545
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:30,544
into your wrist.

546
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:33,479
What?

547
00:18:33,514 --> 00:18:34,648
In the trauma room when you said

548
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:36,617
you were cleaning up.

549
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,185
I was cleaning up.

550
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:40,787
John, I have the chart here.

551
00:18:40,821 --> 00:18:43,389
You drew up 200 of fentanyl
into the syringe.

552
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:44,658
What is this?

553
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:47,260
You gave 150 mikes
to the patient.

554
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,763
Okay, hold on, slow down.

555
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,197
This is a mistake.

556
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:52,799
And you stopped
after three cc's.

557
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:55,168
Yeah, Haleh gave him a bunch of
versed, you were there.

558
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:56,537
What happened to the rest
of the fentanyl?

559
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,771
I don't know.

560
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,472
Must have wasted it
down the sink.

561
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:01,908
Somebody's supposed to witness
you doing that.

562
00:19:01,942 --> 00:19:03,677
Come on.

563
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,378
Come on, we do that
all the time.

564
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:08,248
We have a protocol for
disposal of narcotics.

565
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:09,883
Okay, fine, whatever.

566
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:13,419
That doesn't mean
that I injected it.

567
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,459
Abby.

568
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,361
If you thought you saw something

569
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:23,263
why‐why wouldn't you
come talk to me?

570
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:25,599
It's appropriate for Abby
to come to us.

571
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:26,967
Not when she's wrong.

572
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,803
Carter, are you still
on pain medication?

573
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,337
Why? What?

574
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:32,506
For your back.

575
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:33,807
Yeah, why? A little, why?

576
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,375
How much is a little?

577
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:37,878
Well, that's between me
and my doctor, isn't it?

578
00:19:37,911 --> 00:19:39,713
So, you're not overmedicating?

579
00:19:41,882 --> 00:19:45,351
You think I'm a drug addict?
Hmm?

580
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:47,387
Do you honestly think
I'm a drug addict?

581
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,222
That I'm, what? Sneaking around

582
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:51,758
injecting whatever
narcotics I can find?

583
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:57,297
You guys, you know me,
this is ridiculous.

584
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,464
So you deny this.

585
00:19:58,498 --> 00:20:00,867
Yes, I deny it. Abby..

586
00:20:00,901 --> 00:20:04,237
I, uh, think you're
seeing things.

587
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,639
Maybe you're on drugs.

588
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:07,473
Yeah, I think I saw you
with a needle once.

589
00:20:07,508 --> 00:20:09,309
'Okay, Carter.'

590
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:11,444
If this is a misunderstanding,
I apologize.

591
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:12,846
This is a misunderstanding.

592
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:16,216
You know why we had to ask you.

593
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:19,953
Can I go back to work now?

594
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:28,028
Thank you.

595
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:29,262
And thank you, Abby.

596
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:31,965
I really appreciate that.

597
00:20:35,936 --> 00:20:38,539
‐ He's lying, Mark.
‐ I know.

598
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,011
'We'll call someone
you can talk to'

599
00:20:45,045 --> 00:20:46,479
it doesn't have
to be your parents.

600
00:20:46,513 --> 00:20:47,714
It can be a friend,
a roommate‐‐

601
00:20:47,748 --> 00:20:50,517
No, please, I don't want
to talk to anyone.

602
00:20:50,551 --> 00:20:51,752
Gloria, we don't have much time.

603
00:20:51,785 --> 00:20:52,786
If we're gonna save that baby

604
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:54,521
we need to operate now.

605
00:20:54,555 --> 00:20:56,322
I told you, I don't want it.

606
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:57,858
'You can give the baby
up for adoption.'

607
00:20:57,891 --> 00:20:59,826
Your mom and dad would
never have to know.

608
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,362
I don't want an operation

609
00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:03,930
so just leave me alone,
all of you!

610
00:21:03,964 --> 00:21:07,000
‐ Okay, okay...
‐ Just leave me alone.

611
00:21:07,033 --> 00:21:09,435
Okay, but you're going
to have to keep monitors on.

612
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:10,671
Why?

613
00:21:10,704 --> 00:21:12,038
For your own safety.

614
00:21:12,072 --> 00:21:13,073
We need to know if you

615
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:14,808
start bleeding internally.

616
00:21:14,841 --> 00:21:17,711
Dr. Kovac.

617
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:19,079
Why don't you spin
another crit

618
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:22,549
and cycle the dynamap
every five minutes?

619
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,450
17 years of practice, I thought
I'd seen everything.

620
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:25,586
Are you taking her up?

621
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:27,588
I can't, not if
she doesn't want to.

622
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:29,590
The fetal heart rate
is down to 100.

623
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:31,858
The abruption is progressing.
She needs a C‐section.

624
00:21:31,892 --> 00:21:33,727
I made the consequences
very clear to her.

625
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,562
She doesn't care
about the consequences.

626
00:21:35,596 --> 00:21:36,730
You can't cut
a woman open without

627
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:38,398
her consent, that's assault.

628
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:40,734
‐ The baby will die.
‐ I'm aware of that.

629
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:42,536
And you can stand by
and watch it happen?

630
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:44,004
‐ There's nothing I can do.
‐ You can operate.

631
00:21:44,037 --> 00:21:45,906
No, I can't, I'm sorry.

632
00:21:45,939 --> 00:21:47,373
I'm calling another OB.

633
00:21:47,407 --> 00:21:49,075
Who? I am the head
of the department.

634
00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:51,011
We don't force C‐sections
on women in this hospital.

635
00:21:51,044 --> 00:21:53,780
What if I can get her
declared incompetent?

636
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:55,582
I dunno, she seemed
coherent to me.

637
00:21:55,616 --> 00:21:58,118
I think the stab wound
was self‐inflicted.

638
00:21:58,151 --> 00:21:59,653
You can prove that?

639
00:21:59,686 --> 00:22:00,921
She's delusional.

640
00:22:00,954 --> 00:22:02,889
She claims she didn't know
she was pregnant.

641
00:22:02,923 --> 00:22:04,991
She was lying. That
doesn't mean she's crazy.

642
00:22:05,025 --> 00:22:08,529
What kind of woman carries
a child for eight months

643
00:22:08,562 --> 00:22:09,996
and then refuses
to let us help her baby?

644
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,798
You know what?
Call psych, give it a shot.

645
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:12,999
Then I can bring her up?

646
00:22:13,033 --> 00:22:14,334
Yeah, if they say yes.

647
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:17,638
Side‐biting clamp.

648
00:22:18,905 --> 00:22:20,340
5.0 prolene.

649
00:22:21,975 --> 00:22:24,878
If you ask me, Peter we're lucky
to have this extra time.

650
00:22:24,911 --> 00:22:27,514
Oh, Kovac didn't know the bullet
moved to his heart.

651
00:22:27,548 --> 00:22:29,616
Well, I'd have trouble
prioritizing someone

652
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,484
who shoots at a
playground, too.

653
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:32,686
BP's down, 80 palp.

654
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:34,788
Is that you?

655
00:22:34,821 --> 00:22:36,757
No, no active bleeding.

656
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:37,858
Femoral vessels are clamped.

657
00:22:37,891 --> 00:22:39,826
Shirley, recheck the pressure.

658
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,127
Still falling, 70 palp.

659
00:22:41,161 --> 00:22:43,429
What is it?

660
00:22:43,463 --> 00:22:45,165
Did the bullet embolize?

661
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:47,100
Fluoroscope on.

662
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,175
It's still in the heart for now
but it is moving closer

663
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:56,710
to the pulmonary artery.

664
00:22:56,743 --> 00:22:57,978
We got blood
dripping on the floor.

665
00:22:58,011 --> 00:22:59,412
'Where from'?

666
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:01,915
Shirley, take the towel
off the shoulder.

667
00:23:01,948 --> 00:23:03,083
'He's bleeding out.'

668
00:23:03,116 --> 00:23:04,651
Aw, damn it.
Saline sponge now.

669
00:23:04,685 --> 00:23:07,120
We need six more units
of packed cells up here.

670
00:23:07,988 --> 00:23:09,656
What are you doing?

671
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,625
‐ I've gotta Locate the source.
‐ I just opened his heart.

672
00:23:11,658 --> 00:23:12,993
Well, It won't make a difference
if we don't stop the bleeding.

673
00:23:13,026 --> 00:23:14,427
Wait, wait, just wait.

674
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,729
‐ Clamp the auricle.
‐ I can't.

675
00:23:15,762 --> 00:23:17,497
Just for a second,
the other bullet

676
00:23:17,531 --> 00:23:18,932
must have hit the
axillary artery.

677
00:23:18,965 --> 00:23:20,000
Clamp the subclavian.

678
00:23:20,033 --> 00:23:21,635
I need to get this bullet out.

679
00:23:21,668 --> 00:23:23,469
Then I'll do it myself. Move.
Potts, let's go.

680
00:23:23,504 --> 00:23:24,505
Pressure's down to 60.

681
00:23:24,538 --> 00:23:25,672
Where's that damn blood?!

682
00:23:25,706 --> 00:23:27,774
Shirley, give him
a saline bolus.

683
00:23:27,808 --> 00:23:29,710
Come on, damn it.

684
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:31,878
'I can't reach the artery.'

685
00:23:31,912 --> 00:23:34,214
Alright crank the sternum
open a little wider.

686
00:23:35,516 --> 00:23:38,785
he's in V‐fib!
Paddles, paddles!

687
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:40,787
‐ Peter, get your hands out now.
‐ Hold on, hold on!

688
00:23:40,821 --> 00:23:42,689
Clear, now!

689
00:23:42,723 --> 00:23:44,658
Got it, go!

690
00:23:47,561 --> 00:23:48,795
I don't know what to tell you.

691
00:23:48,829 --> 00:23:49,930
But I've got a
tournament next week.

692
00:23:49,963 --> 00:23:51,497
I can't miss the tournament.

693
00:23:51,532 --> 00:23:53,700
You've broken your collarbone,
Mr. Tanner.

694
00:23:53,734 --> 00:23:55,201
Aside from seriously
hurting yourself

695
00:23:55,235 --> 00:23:57,037
you'd be worthless on the field.

696
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,705
Well, can't you just put
a cast on it or something?

697
00:23:58,739 --> 00:24:00,707
No, we sling it, and you rest.

698
00:24:00,741 --> 00:24:02,042
Well, then it
can't be that bad.

699
00:24:02,075 --> 00:24:03,910
Yosh, could you get
Mr. Tanner a sling?

700
00:24:03,944 --> 00:24:05,245
I'll have to call central.

701
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:07,247
All we have are smalls,
he looks large.

702
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,749
Hey, Mark.

703
00:24:08,782 --> 00:24:10,216
You better make that
extra‐large, mate.

704
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,452
I'll be back to discharge you.

705
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:18,859
So, I talked to legal.

706
00:24:18,892 --> 00:24:20,160
Did you use his name?

707
00:24:20,193 --> 00:24:22,596
No, I spoke in hypotheticals.

708
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:24,631
Bottom line,
we need more evidence.

709
00:24:24,665 --> 00:24:26,667
But he can't treat
patients, right?

710
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,869
It's one accusation,
we have to be careful.

711
00:24:28,902 --> 00:24:31,071
Can we ask him to drug test?

712
00:24:31,104 --> 00:24:33,006
He's taking
a prescribed pain medication

713
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,541
he'll test positive

714
00:24:34,575 --> 00:24:35,776
and I'm afraid just asking

715
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:37,778
will push him further away.

716
00:24:37,811 --> 00:24:39,012
What do you want to do?

717
00:24:39,045 --> 00:24:41,081
I want to get him some help.

718
00:24:43,283 --> 00:24:44,951
Let me talk to him again.

719
00:24:44,985 --> 00:24:46,019
He might open up

720
00:24:46,052 --> 00:24:47,253
if he doesn't see it
as a threat.

721
00:24:47,287 --> 00:24:49,523
Mark, how could we
let this happen?

722
00:24:49,556 --> 00:24:51,758
I mean, he showed all the signs.

723
00:24:51,792 --> 00:24:53,827
I know, I know.

724
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,529
But it's Carter.

725
00:24:55,562 --> 00:24:57,263
your mind just doesn't go there.

726
00:25:04,237 --> 00:25:07,641
'She's a little calmer now,
that's a good sign.'

727
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:08,875
He'll talk her into it.

728
00:25:08,909 --> 00:25:09,943
How do you know?

729
00:25:09,976 --> 00:25:10,977
He has to.

730
00:25:11,011 --> 00:25:12,579
‐ 'Dr. Kovac?'
‐ Yeah?

731
00:25:12,613 --> 00:25:14,280
'This is Vinny Rosato,
Nicholas' father'

732
00:25:14,314 --> 00:25:16,016
The boy from the school.

733
00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:19,019
Oh, yes, yes. Hi, Mr. Rosato.

734
00:25:19,052 --> 00:25:21,888
‐ Your son is in surgery.
‐ How bad is it?

735
00:25:21,922 --> 00:25:23,857
He was shot in the
leg and the shoulder.

736
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:26,059
The surgeons should be able
to repair those injuries

737
00:25:26,092 --> 00:25:29,630
but one bullet has traveled
to his heart.

738
00:25:29,663 --> 00:25:31,231
‐ He was shot in the heart?
‐ No, no, no.

739
00:25:31,264 --> 00:25:33,934
The bullet was swept
through the vein

740
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:37,137
but there shouldn't be
any major tissue damage.

741
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:39,172
Can they get it out?

742
00:25:40,607 --> 00:25:42,008
We should take you upstairs.

743
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:44,177
There you can get
more updated information.

744
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,245
I'll take you, Mr. Rosato.

745
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:47,881
Thank you, Cleo.

746
00:25:47,914 --> 00:25:50,283
'She's certainly
emotionally distraught.'

747
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:51,818
She could be
clinically depressed

748
00:25:51,852 --> 00:25:53,820
and even have
a personality disorder.

749
00:25:53,854 --> 00:25:55,622
Can you declare her incompetent?

750
00:25:55,656 --> 00:25:57,323
But she's not
acutely psychotic.

751
00:25:57,357 --> 00:26:00,026
She understands that failing
to perform the C‐section

752
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,695
could endanger her baby's life.

753
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:03,163
You mean kill it.

754
00:26:03,196 --> 00:26:04,765
She's willing to take the risk.

755
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:06,733
It's not a risk,
she wants it to happen.

756
00:26:06,767 --> 00:26:09,135
She stabbed herself
to make it happen.

757
00:26:09,169 --> 00:26:10,370
You have no evidence of that.

758
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:12,138
And she's a danger to others.

759
00:26:12,172 --> 00:26:14,140
‐ Who?
‐ The baby.

760
00:26:14,174 --> 00:26:17,644
Doesn't count,
it's still her body.

761
00:26:17,678 --> 00:26:19,379
Is the C‐section necessary
to save her life?

762
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:21,314
Somewhere there has
to be a point‐‐

763
00:26:21,347 --> 00:26:23,784
Is it?

764
00:26:23,817 --> 00:26:25,285
No.

765
00:26:25,318 --> 00:26:28,221
Then without a court order,
you can't touch her.

766
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:29,890
I don't have time
for a court order.

767
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:31,658
That baby needs to come out now.

768
00:26:31,692 --> 00:26:32,893
We can try to expedite it.

769
00:26:32,926 --> 00:26:35,261
Our legal department
knows friendly judges.

770
00:26:35,295 --> 00:26:37,230
You'll have to write up
an affidavit.

771
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:39,299
Yeah, whatever.

772
00:26:50,143 --> 00:26:52,412
When'd you start smoking?

773
00:26:52,445 --> 00:26:54,848
Well, that depends,
does it make me a druggie?

774
00:26:54,881 --> 00:26:58,251
Ask the surgeon general.

775
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:01,187
I'm worried about you,
Carter.

776
00:27:01,221 --> 00:27:02,656
Look, I'm okay.

777
00:27:02,689 --> 00:27:04,958
I got angry,
and I shouldn't have.

778
00:27:04,991 --> 00:27:07,060
Not that I didn't have a right.

779
00:27:07,093 --> 00:27:09,229
I'm okay.

780
00:27:09,262 --> 00:27:11,397
You didn't talk
to anyone, did you?

781
00:27:11,431 --> 00:27:13,366
Any psychiatrists?

782
00:27:15,368 --> 00:27:18,805
‐ No.
‐ Why not?

783
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:20,774
'Cause I didn't
feel like talking.

784
00:27:22,175 --> 00:27:23,209
Look, I'm gonna be fine

785
00:27:23,243 --> 00:27:26,713
or I hope that I‐I will be.

786
00:27:26,747 --> 00:27:28,014
It's been rough.

787
00:27:28,048 --> 00:27:29,082
You can understand that

788
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:30,684
I got stabbed in the back twice

789
00:27:30,717 --> 00:27:33,019
with a six‐inch butcher knife.

790
00:27:33,053 --> 00:27:35,989
I'm in a lot of pain

791
00:27:36,022 --> 00:27:38,959
and this place isn't exactly
the easiest work environment.

792
00:27:41,461 --> 00:27:43,196
Lucy's dead,
which is partly my fault.

793
00:27:43,229 --> 00:27:44,831
I haven't slept in months.

794
00:27:44,865 --> 00:27:48,001
I‐I had to take more pain
medication just to function.

795
00:27:52,005 --> 00:27:53,473
I didn't steal it.

796
00:27:53,507 --> 00:27:55,141
It was prescribed to me.

797
00:27:55,175 --> 00:27:56,409
Did you take
the prescribed amount?

798
00:27:56,442 --> 00:27:59,312
Yeah, more or less.

799
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:05,952
I think you need help, Carter.

800
00:28:05,986 --> 00:28:09,956
Look, I understand that you have
to make this your business.

801
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:13,093
But please, please let me
deal with it.

802
00:28:13,126 --> 00:28:14,961
When are you off?

803
00:28:14,995 --> 00:28:16,930
Midnight.

804
00:28:16,963 --> 00:28:19,099
Okay, I don't want you
to see any more patients.

805
00:28:19,132 --> 00:28:21,768
You can work
on QA Chart reviews.

806
00:28:21,802 --> 00:28:23,136
I can see patients.
There's nothing wrong with‐‐

807
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:25,305
Carter, you have to trust me.

808
00:28:27,941 --> 00:28:29,876
Let me figure this out.

809
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:50,063
We got to write this one up.

810
00:28:50,096 --> 00:28:51,297
Oh, yeah, including the part

811
00:28:51,331 --> 00:28:52,332
where you lifted
him off the table

812
00:28:52,365 --> 00:28:53,834
while I was opening his heart?

813
00:28:53,867 --> 00:28:55,068
And cranking his chest
with one hand

814
00:28:55,101 --> 00:28:56,302
and suturing with the other.

815
00:28:56,336 --> 00:28:58,805
I still have a few moves
you haven't seen.

816
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:00,306
Listen, okay, dibs on the
bullet, alright.

817
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,042
‐ No way, it's mine.
‐ What are you talking about?

818
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:03,777
‐ I was the one that called it.
‐ Yeah, but I fished it out.

819
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,111
‐ Yeah, but‐‐
‐ Hey, Cleo.

820
00:29:05,145 --> 00:29:06,813
Hey, we just made a great save.

821
00:29:06,847 --> 00:29:08,248
I can see that.

822
00:29:08,281 --> 00:29:09,382
Yeah, we got the bullet out
of the boy's heart

823
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:12,218
and Peter saved
his arm and his leg.

824
00:29:12,252 --> 00:29:14,821
The father's outside recovery,
waiting to talk to someone.

825
00:29:14,855 --> 00:29:16,790
Oh, okay. I'll do it.

826
00:29:18,892 --> 00:29:21,027
What's wrong?

827
00:29:21,061 --> 00:29:22,262
Nothing.

828
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:32,238
Hey.

829
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,108
Dr. Carter, I didn't
know what to do

830
00:29:35,141 --> 00:29:38,845
so I asked Dr. Greene.
I'm sorry.

831
00:29:38,879 --> 00:29:40,113
And I know I don't
know you very well

832
00:29:40,146 --> 00:29:41,848
but I think you're
a good doctor

833
00:29:41,882 --> 00:29:43,449
and I know you've been through
a lot in a short time

834
00:29:43,483 --> 00:29:45,519
and I'm sure I couldn't
handle it myself

835
00:29:45,552 --> 00:29:47,821
but I felt
I had to tell them.

836
00:29:49,222 --> 00:29:50,824
You feel better?

837
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,296
Because I have work to do.

838
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:06,106
Okay, Mr. Tanner,
here's a prescription.

839
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:08,842
You'll need to take one
every six hours for pain.

840
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:12,045
And you're going to wanna
ice that, Mr. Tanner.

841
00:30:12,078 --> 00:30:13,479
Mr. Tanner?

842
00:30:13,514 --> 00:30:15,148
Yosh, get Dr. Greene, now!

843
00:30:15,181 --> 00:30:16,449
‐ What is it?
‐ Barely has a pulse.

844
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:18,084
Lily, I need a BP.

845
00:30:18,118 --> 00:30:19,119
What did he present with?

846
00:30:19,152 --> 00:30:20,386
'Fractured clavicle'

847
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,556
'absent breath sounds
on the left.'

848
00:30:22,589 --> 00:30:23,590
Must be a tension pneumo.

849
00:30:23,624 --> 00:30:24,958
Get a 14‐gauge needle

850
00:30:24,991 --> 00:30:27,060
on an open syringe.

851
00:30:27,093 --> 00:30:28,394
Come on, let's go.

852
00:30:28,428 --> 00:30:29,530
'BP's 50 palp.'

853
00:30:29,563 --> 00:30:31,331
‐ Betadine?
‐ Yep.

854
00:30:31,364 --> 00:30:34,067
Quickly, quickly,
get him on a pulse ox.

855
00:30:37,037 --> 00:30:38,038
I got it.

856
00:30:38,071 --> 00:30:39,239
Okay, check a pulse.

857
00:30:41,041 --> 00:30:42,275
It's stronger.

858
00:30:42,308 --> 00:30:43,343
Still need a chest tube.

859
00:30:43,376 --> 00:30:44,645
Already has broken collarbone.

860
00:30:44,678 --> 00:30:46,446
Not anymore.

861
00:30:46,479 --> 00:30:49,115
Satting at 95.

862
00:30:49,149 --> 00:30:51,051
Okay, give me a ten blade.

863
00:30:52,318 --> 00:30:53,587
Carter, what are you doing?

864
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,288
I'm saving this guy's life.

865
00:30:55,321 --> 00:30:57,223
You must've missed
an occult rib fracture.

866
00:30:57,257 --> 00:30:58,458
I'll take it from here.

867
00:30:58,491 --> 00:31:00,927
The needle decompressed.
Give me the Kelly.

868
00:31:00,961 --> 00:31:01,995
I got it, Carter.

869
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:03,063
I'm almost in.

870
00:31:09,503 --> 00:31:11,972
Right. Right, you take it.

871
00:31:16,943 --> 00:31:18,945
32 French.

872
00:31:18,979 --> 00:31:20,080
'Suction's ready.'

873
00:31:20,113 --> 00:31:22,482
'BP's 100 over 60.'

874
00:31:22,516 --> 00:31:23,984
You're welcome.

875
00:31:27,988 --> 00:31:30,056
'I'm in. Hook me up.'

876
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:31,057
Abby..

877
00:31:34,695 --> 00:31:36,396
Call as soon as you know.

878
00:31:36,429 --> 00:31:38,565
‐ Yes, thank you.
‐ He didn't sign it?

879
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:39,700
They got there at 6:30.

880
00:31:39,733 --> 00:31:41,334
The judge had already left

881
00:31:41,367 --> 00:31:42,669
but the clerk is trying
to track him down.

882
00:31:42,703 --> 00:31:44,104
Can't we try another judge?

883
00:31:44,137 --> 00:31:45,171
They're already working on that.

884
00:31:45,205 --> 00:31:46,573
I‐I can't wait.

885
00:31:46,607 --> 00:31:49,042
Luca. you can't do anything
until we get it.

886
00:31:49,075 --> 00:31:50,376
I've waited too long already.

887
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,212
Promise me that you
won't do anything.

888
00:31:52,245 --> 00:31:54,014
No, I'm going
to change her mind.

889
00:31:58,351 --> 00:31:59,653
We need to do this tonight.

890
00:31:59,686 --> 00:32:01,021
'I don't believe it.'

891
00:32:01,054 --> 00:32:02,122
Well, it makes sense.

892
00:32:02,155 --> 00:32:03,189
He's been so unpredictable

893
00:32:03,223 --> 00:32:04,525
I thought he might be bipolar.

894
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:06,026
Carter? Come on, no way.

895
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:07,994
He as much as
admitted it to me.

896
00:32:08,028 --> 00:32:09,095
Peter, he's using.

897
00:32:09,129 --> 00:32:10,363
'I don't know for how long'

898
00:32:10,396 --> 00:32:11,665
'but the behavior's
been there for a while.'

899
00:32:11,698 --> 00:32:14,000
But is this the right way
to do it?

900
00:32:14,034 --> 00:32:15,602
He might feel ganged‐up on.

901
00:32:15,636 --> 00:32:18,338
It's either this or we have to
kick it to some committee.

902
00:32:18,371 --> 00:32:20,440
You know, I'd rather approach
him as a small group

903
00:32:20,473 --> 00:32:22,108
'that he knows and trusts'

904
00:32:22,142 --> 00:32:23,744
'and give him a chance
to clear it up.'

905
00:32:23,777 --> 00:32:25,311
And what about Romano?

906
00:32:25,345 --> 00:32:27,147
No, we don't want
to bring him into this.

907
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,149
you know what,
Carter can be stubborn.

908
00:32:29,182 --> 00:32:30,551
He might just walk out.

909
00:32:30,584 --> 00:32:32,152
And we have to be
prepared for that.

910
00:32:32,185 --> 00:32:34,454
All we can do is
be compassionate but clear.

911
00:32:34,487 --> 00:32:37,123
He has two options, that's it.

912
00:32:40,193 --> 00:32:42,128
Are you with us, Peter?

913
00:32:43,496 --> 00:32:45,398
'Kerry?'

914
00:32:45,431 --> 00:32:48,034
‐ You needed me?
‐ Yeah, Don.

915
00:32:48,068 --> 00:32:50,003
So, what's the big emergency?

916
00:32:50,036 --> 00:32:52,005
'Why don't you have a seat?'

917
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:55,375
Fetal heart rate down to 60.

918
00:32:55,408 --> 00:32:57,410
Get a baby warmer in here.

919
00:32:57,443 --> 00:32:59,513
Gloria, I don't have time
to argue anymore.

920
00:32:59,546 --> 00:33:01,447
This baby needs
to come out now.

921
00:33:01,481 --> 00:33:03,016
I want another doctor.

922
00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:04,050
The placenta's detaching.

923
00:33:04,084 --> 00:33:05,451
You could hemorrhage to death.

924
00:33:05,485 --> 00:33:06,486
You're trying to scare me.

925
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,721
You should be scared.

926
00:33:07,754 --> 00:33:08,755
If you don't care
about your baby

927
00:33:08,789 --> 00:33:10,190
at least think of yourself.

928
00:33:10,223 --> 00:33:11,457
I don't believe you.

929
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:12,693
You would've done
something already.

930
00:33:12,726 --> 00:33:15,195
'Heart rate's down to 50.'

931
00:33:15,228 --> 00:33:16,697
You're going to
have a boy, Gloria.

932
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:19,199
I can tell
from the ultrasound.

933
00:33:19,232 --> 00:33:21,034
You really want
to kill your son?

934
00:33:21,067 --> 00:33:23,169
Leave me alone.
I want another doctor!

935
00:33:23,203 --> 00:33:25,739
Down to 40.

936
00:33:25,772 --> 00:33:26,773
Okay, that's it.

937
00:33:26,807 --> 00:33:28,474
100 of ketamine, IV push.

938
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:30,043
Dr. Kovac..

939
00:33:30,076 --> 00:33:31,477
You heard me.
Draw up the ketamine.

940
00:33:31,512 --> 00:33:33,179
‐ You can't.
‐ I'm the attending!

941
00:33:33,213 --> 00:33:34,515
I'll take full responsibility!

942
00:33:34,548 --> 00:33:36,349
‐ What are you doing?
‐ Please don't do this.

943
00:33:36,382 --> 00:33:39,219
I‐I don't want the baby.

944
00:33:39,252 --> 00:33:40,554
C‐section tray, prep her.

945
00:33:40,587 --> 00:33:42,055
I don't want the baby!

946
00:33:42,088 --> 00:33:43,289
Heart rate's down to 20.

947
00:33:43,323 --> 00:33:45,526
Please! Please, help me!

948
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:47,060
Cleo, set up the suction.

949
00:33:47,093 --> 00:33:48,695
‐ No, I won't.
‐ Then get out of the way!

950
00:33:48,729 --> 00:33:50,263
Luka, she didn't consent.

951
00:33:50,296 --> 00:33:52,098
‐ You could lose your license.
‐ Ten blade.

952
00:33:52,132 --> 00:33:53,199
Lost the heart rate.

953
00:33:53,233 --> 00:33:55,435
You can't do this.

954
00:33:55,468 --> 00:33:57,203
You can't.

955
00:34:07,447 --> 00:34:09,516
Is it over?

956
00:34:20,393 --> 00:34:21,695
Carter?

957
00:34:21,728 --> 00:34:23,530
Got a minute?

958
00:34:23,564 --> 00:34:25,532
No, I'm done with these.

959
00:34:25,566 --> 00:34:27,167
If you guys don't want me
to see patients today

960
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,835
‐ I'm gonna go home.
‐ Not yet.

961
00:34:28,869 --> 00:34:31,471
I need to talk to you.

962
00:34:31,505 --> 00:34:33,206
Is this my suspension?

963
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,576
Not here, come on.

964
00:34:51,792 --> 00:34:53,226
Oh, God.

965
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:54,260
Give me a break.

966
00:34:54,294 --> 00:34:56,597
Carter, just listen.

967
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:59,833
No, I told you I am on
painkillers for my back

968
00:34:59,866 --> 00:35:00,901
but I'm functional.

969
00:35:00,934 --> 00:35:03,336
'Dr. Carter.'

970
00:35:03,369 --> 00:35:07,641
You would be wise
to be quiet and listen.

971
00:35:10,844 --> 00:35:13,279
My van is parked outside.

972
00:35:13,313 --> 00:35:15,749
We have a ticket to Atlanta.

973
00:35:15,782 --> 00:35:18,384
There's a drug rehab..

974
00:35:20,286 --> 00:35:22,188
There's a drug
rehab center there

975
00:35:22,222 --> 00:35:25,458
that specializes in treating
doctors with addiction.

976
00:35:25,491 --> 00:35:27,528
Well, that's great but I'm on
prescribed painkillers

977
00:35:27,561 --> 00:35:28,595
and that doesn't
make me an addict

978
00:35:28,629 --> 00:35:29,730
and I think you all know it.

979
00:35:29,763 --> 00:35:31,397
I'm not finished!

980
00:35:33,534 --> 00:35:35,836
It's apparent to all of us
that you have a drug problem.

981
00:35:35,869 --> 00:35:37,738
'Therefore we cannot allow you'

982
00:35:37,771 --> 00:35:41,207
'to continue working here or
anywhere else as a physician.'

983
00:35:41,241 --> 00:35:43,309
'So you have two choices'

984
00:35:43,343 --> 00:35:45,712
'get in the van,
go to the airport'

985
00:35:45,746 --> 00:35:47,848
'check yourself in'

986
00:35:47,881 --> 00:35:49,683
'and when you come back'

987
00:35:49,716 --> 00:35:54,420
'we will support you
in any way that we can.'

988
00:35:54,454 --> 00:35:57,257
Or I'm fired?

989
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:59,425
Yeah.

990
00:36:01,662 --> 00:36:04,665
'Everyone in this room
cares about you.'

991
00:36:04,698 --> 00:36:06,299
No one is judging you.

992
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:08,201
Yes, you are.

993
00:36:08,234 --> 00:36:10,203
You've already judged me.

994
00:36:10,236 --> 00:36:11,805
You have no idea
what I've been through

995
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:14,841
these last few months but I've
been here, I've showed up.

996
00:36:14,875 --> 00:36:16,977
I haven't made excuses.
I haven't complained.

997
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:18,745
‐ That's not the point‐‐
‐ No, that is the point.

998
00:36:18,779 --> 00:36:20,313
Can anybody tell me that

999
00:36:20,346 --> 00:36:23,283
uh, uh, that I have
endangered patients?

1000
00:36:24,718 --> 00:36:26,553
I mean can anybody here say that

1001
00:36:26,587 --> 00:36:28,655
my performance has changed?

1002
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:32,292
Hmm? That I'm some kind
of liability?

1003
00:36:34,294 --> 00:36:36,362
John, you put a patient

1004
00:36:36,396 --> 00:36:38,965
into anaphylactic shock
by giving her bactrim

1005
00:36:38,999 --> 00:36:41,835
when she told you
that she was allergic to it.

1006
00:36:41,868 --> 00:36:43,369
And you almost killed somebody

1007
00:36:43,403 --> 00:36:45,238
by leaving a guide wire
in their chest.

1008
00:36:45,271 --> 00:36:47,908
Is this about mistakes?

1009
00:36:47,941 --> 00:36:48,942
Hmm?

1010
00:36:48,975 --> 00:36:50,443
Who here hasn't made a mistake?

1011
00:36:50,476 --> 00:36:51,712
Hell, I saved your ass
this afternoon.

1012
00:36:51,745 --> 00:36:54,480
'John, you've demonstrated'

1013
00:36:54,515 --> 00:36:55,882
'compulsive, drug‐seeking
behavior.'

1014
00:36:55,916 --> 00:36:57,383
When? Just tell me when?

1015
00:36:57,417 --> 00:36:58,418
You know, I think
mainlining fentanyl

1016
00:36:58,451 --> 00:36:59,520
in the trauma room qualifies.

1017
00:36:59,553 --> 00:37:00,721
Well, I told you
I didn't do that.

1018
00:37:00,754 --> 00:37:02,355
You want to call me
a liar, fine

1019
00:37:02,388 --> 00:37:03,690
call me a liar,
but I didn't do that.

1020
00:37:03,724 --> 00:37:05,692
‐ Okay, show us your wrists.
‐ What?

1021
00:37:05,726 --> 00:37:08,629
Show us your wrists!

1022
00:37:12,365 --> 00:37:15,335
Are we looking for track marks?

1023
00:37:15,368 --> 00:37:18,038
Yeah.

1024
00:37:18,071 --> 00:37:19,906
Well, there, see?

1025
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,408
Here, want me to roll up
my sleeves?

1026
00:37:22,442 --> 00:37:24,244
Take off your watch.

1027
00:37:29,449 --> 00:37:33,386
Uh, you know, you know what?

1028
00:37:33,419 --> 00:37:34,621
Forget it, forget it.

1029
00:37:34,655 --> 00:37:35,789
This is your only
chance, Carter.

1030
00:37:35,822 --> 00:37:37,490
Great, I quit.

1031
00:37:41,327 --> 00:37:44,397
Well, is that it?

1032
00:37:46,533 --> 00:37:48,468
No.

1033
00:37:55,876 --> 00:37:57,544
What are you doing?

1034
00:37:57,578 --> 00:37:58,845
I don't need this.

1035
00:37:58,879 --> 00:38:01,081
I've never needed this.

1036
00:38:01,114 --> 00:38:03,083
I wanted to be a doctor
I wanted to help people

1037
00:38:03,116 --> 00:38:04,751
but I don't need
their damn job.

1038
00:38:04,785 --> 00:38:05,886
Carter, you don't
want to do this.

1039
00:38:05,919 --> 00:38:07,821
No, I'm not doing it, they are.

1040
00:38:11,558 --> 00:38:13,093
‐ Carter, wait!
‐ No.

1041
00:38:13,126 --> 00:38:14,828
Carter, what are you going to
do? Piss it all away?

1042
00:38:14,861 --> 00:38:16,563
Everything you worked for
eight years of your life‐‐

1043
00:38:16,597 --> 00:38:17,998
They're the ones there
handing out the ultimatums.

1044
00:38:18,031 --> 00:38:19,099
No ultimatums, Carter!

1045
00:38:19,132 --> 00:38:20,333
You're getting in that van!

1046
00:38:20,366 --> 00:38:21,367
Like hell I am.

1047
00:38:21,401 --> 00:38:22,736
You're not gonna do this.

1048
00:38:22,769 --> 00:38:23,870
They tell you that
I'm some kinda junkie

1049
00:38:23,904 --> 00:38:25,071
and you believe them

1050
00:38:25,105 --> 00:38:26,472
and you come
down and ambush me!

1051
00:38:26,507 --> 00:38:27,674
Carter, you're
out of control, man!

1052
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:28,742
If you can't see that,
then I don't care

1053
00:38:28,775 --> 00:38:29,810
but you're getting
into that van.

1054
00:38:29,843 --> 00:38:31,111
‐ No.
‐ Get in the van.

1055
00:38:31,144 --> 00:38:32,378
‐ Don't touch me.
‐ Get in the‐‐

1056
00:38:32,412 --> 00:38:36,416
Don't touch me!

1057
00:38:36,449 --> 00:38:39,886
Where does it end, man, huh?

1058
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,454
This week fentanyl,
next week you end up dead

1059
00:38:41,487 --> 00:38:42,956
or worse, you end up
like your cousin

1060
00:38:42,989 --> 00:38:44,891
some babbling gork in a nurs..

1061
00:38:49,996 --> 00:38:51,565
Carter, you want to fight,
that's cool, man

1062
00:38:51,598 --> 00:38:54,467
but either way you're getting
your ass in that van.

1063
00:39:14,187 --> 00:39:15,722
It's alright, man.

1064
00:39:18,925 --> 00:39:21,695
It's alright, Carter.

1065
00:39:29,736 --> 00:39:32,806
‐ Good job, that's good.
‐ He's crowning.

1066
00:39:32,839 --> 00:39:34,875
Almost there, Gloria.
One more push should do it.

1067
00:39:34,908 --> 00:39:37,043
Ready? And push.

1068
00:39:39,513 --> 00:39:41,948
Push.

1069
00:39:41,982 --> 00:39:43,817
The head is out.

1070
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:45,786
Okay, you can stop now.

1071
00:39:51,792 --> 00:39:54,394
Clamp.

1072
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:58,164
And cut.

1073
00:40:17,818 --> 00:40:19,720
Does she want to see him?

1074
00:40:19,753 --> 00:40:21,755
Would you
like to see him, Gloria?

1075
00:40:23,857 --> 00:40:24,991
No.

1076
00:40:29,996 --> 00:40:31,464
You want me to pronounce him?

1077
00:40:31,497 --> 00:40:32,833
No, I'll do it.

1078
00:40:41,007 --> 00:40:43,944
Time of death, 19:47.

1079
00:40:58,592 --> 00:40:59,660
Did he get on the plane?

1080
00:40:59,693 --> 00:41:01,127
I don't know.
Peter hasn't called.

1081
00:41:01,161 --> 00:41:02,629
‐ I wonder what he said.
‐ Who knows?

1082
00:41:02,663 --> 00:41:04,965
‐ I just hope Carter gets on.
‐ Yeah.

1083
00:41:04,998 --> 00:41:07,601
Well, it's nice to see
the ER Brain trust

1084
00:41:07,634 --> 00:41:08,969
is diligently
working after hours.

1085
00:41:09,002 --> 00:41:10,003
Hello, Robert.

1086
00:41:10,036 --> 00:41:11,237
ICU is a zoo.

1087
00:41:11,271 --> 00:41:12,506
Seems nice and
peaceful down here.

1088
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:13,540
Yeah, same old stuff.

1089
00:41:13,574 --> 00:41:14,608
Here the fun never stops.

1090
00:41:14,641 --> 00:41:16,042
Elizabeth, Walt Newman

1091
00:41:16,076 --> 00:41:17,644
the intussusception upstairs.

1092
00:41:17,678 --> 00:41:19,112
‐ What about him?
‐ Tried to reduce with an enema.

1093
00:41:19,145 --> 00:41:20,213
Left a big mess.

1094
00:41:20,246 --> 00:41:23,216
‐ We have to go in.
‐ Now?

1095
00:41:23,249 --> 00:41:25,185
Yeah, it's not quite as sexy

1096
00:41:25,218 --> 00:41:26,953
as snakin' a bullet
out of the heart

1097
00:41:26,987 --> 00:41:29,523
but it's a life‐saving
procedure nonetheless.

1098
00:41:29,556 --> 00:41:30,591
Coming right up.

1099
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,625
Thank you.

1100
00:41:34,595 --> 00:41:35,896
Goodnight, all.

1101
00:41:41,201 --> 00:41:43,670
‐ I guess I lost my ride.
‐ That's right.

1102
00:41:43,704 --> 00:41:45,105
That's alright.
I'll take the El.

1103
00:41:45,138 --> 00:41:46,907
‐ You sure?
‐ Yeah, I'll see you at home.

1104
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:49,042
I'll try not to wake you.

1105
00:41:49,075 --> 00:41:52,212
‐ Goodnight, Kerry.
‐ Goodnight.

1106
00:41:52,245 --> 00:41:54,280
Want to go get something
to eat or something?

1107
00:41:54,314 --> 00:41:57,083
Uh, no, I‐I think I'll wait
to hear that he got on.

1108
00:41:57,117 --> 00:41:59,586
‐ Okay, well, call me.
‐ Okay.

1109
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,755
‐ Thanks.
‐ Uh, just a minute.

1110
00:42:01,788 --> 00:42:03,089
‐ Uh, Dr. Weaver?
‐ Yeah.

1111
00:42:03,123 --> 00:42:05,191
I've got legal on line three.

1112
00:42:05,225 --> 00:42:08,161
They say to go ahead.
The judge signed a court order.
