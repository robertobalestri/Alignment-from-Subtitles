1
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,332
I couldn't sleep.

2
00:00:21,356 --> 00:00:24,491
We should start taking
your blood pressure every day.

3
00:00:26,619 --> 00:00:29,196
This is very sweet and responsible.

4
00:00:29,431 --> 00:00:34,201
Yes, I am going to try
to be extra responsible now.

5
00:00:34,527 --> 00:00:36,026
Yeah.

6
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,616
W-We... We have to talk
about what we... want to do.

7
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:44,546
I love you.

8
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,482
I want a child. So I want this child.

9
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:49,424
I love you, too.

10
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:53,895
And I do want kids,
but it's complicated.

11
00:00:54,613 --> 00:00:56,991
Is this the right time in my career?

12
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,260
In our relationship?

13
00:00:59,284 --> 00:01:00,495
Am I too young?

14
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:01,596
Can we afford this?

15
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,099
Am I willing to make
this commitment right now?

16
00:01:04,123 --> 00:01:05,967
We can start depositing money

17
00:01:05,991 --> 00:01:07,702
into a shared account for expenses,

18
00:01:07,726 --> 00:01:10,305
and I can talk to Dr. Glassman
about hiring you an assistant

19
00:01:10,329 --> 00:01:11,473
to help with your workload...

20
00:01:11,497 --> 00:01:12,674
Shaun, just slow down.

21
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:15,210
I-I don't need you
to answer these questions now.

22
00:01:15,234 --> 00:01:17,545
I just need to... think.

23
00:01:17,569 --> 00:01:19,288
To figure out what to do.

24
00:01:19,905 --> 00:01:21,783
And you do, too.

25
00:01:26,745 --> 00:01:29,057
Dr. Chambers, I'd like you
to meet a few of our residents.

26
00:01:29,081 --> 00:01:29,991
This is Doctor... I know that I'm old,

27
00:01:30,015 --> 00:01:32,494
but I can still read name tags.

28
00:01:32,518 --> 00:01:35,130
Dr. Chambers, you started
experiencing aches

29
00:01:35,154 --> 00:01:36,764
in your right hand a month ago?

30
00:01:36,788 --> 00:01:38,867
Then tremors, weakness, spasms.

31
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:41,236
Had to drop out in the middle of
a bowel resection last Friday.

32
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,939
I sent you a video of the surgery.

33
00:01:42,988 --> 00:01:45,309
Given your symptoms, it seems
that carpal tunnel...

34
00:01:45,347 --> 00:01:46,585
Oh, it "seems."

35
00:01:48,387 --> 00:01:49,711
Well, then, problem solved.

36
00:01:50,334 --> 00:01:51,556
I'll be on my way.

37
00:01:51,581 --> 00:01:53,259
Sir, can I just say that the documentary

38
00:01:53,283 --> 00:01:55,428
on your work in Haiti changed my life.

39
00:01:55,452 --> 00:01:56,796
It's the reason why I went into...

40
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,800
If you want to suck up to me,
call me "doctor," not "sir."

41
00:01:59,825 --> 00:02:01,602
And this is a hospital, not Coachella.

42
00:02:01,626 --> 00:02:03,237
If you can't wear something appropriate,

43
00:02:03,261 --> 00:02:05,473
at least try something that fits.

44
00:02:10,053 --> 00:02:12,332
Rule out autoimmune disorders,
hypothyroidism,

45
00:02:12,356 --> 00:02:16,144
diabetes, amyloidosis, MS,
and multiple myeloma.

46
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:18,736
Then we'll get back to carpal tunnel.

47
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:21,450
Alright.

48
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,985
If you have any other questions
or concerns,

49
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:24,036
please don't hesitate...

50
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,266
Twelve.

51
00:02:25,304 --> 00:02:29,099
First, I prefer blankets
not made of sandpaper.

52
00:02:29,124 --> 00:02:31,236
Second, dim these damn lights.

53
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,939
This isn't some
San Fernando Valley porn shoot.

54
00:02:33,963 --> 00:02:35,240
If you made a list,

55
00:02:35,264 --> 00:02:37,130
you don't need to tell us.

56
00:02:40,844 --> 00:02:42,888
He's had the pain for nine months now.

57
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:44,386
And it's on both sides?

58
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,054
Mm-hmm. Sometimes his forehead,

59
00:02:46,336 --> 00:02:47,980
other times his cheeks, his nose.

60
00:02:48,004 --> 00:02:50,216
And it's persisting through
very high doses of hydrocodone.

61
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,896
Yeah, obviously,
the drugs don't work. It's why I'm here.

62
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,120
Oscar.

63
00:02:54,144 --> 00:02:56,355
It's a fair question.

64
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,605
Look, I'm sorry.

65
00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:00,974
Okay, I've been to six doctors now.

66
00:03:01,351 --> 00:03:02,528
I can't work.

67
00:03:02,552 --> 00:03:05,097
I mean, I-I c...
I can't even kiss my wife.

68
00:03:05,121 --> 00:03:06,565
I can hardly smile.

69
00:03:06,876 --> 00:03:08,676
I'm just gonna lightly brush your cheek.

70
00:03:12,717 --> 00:03:13,895
Okay.

71
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,733
Please... help me.

72
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:25,432
I've been on the phone for like
an hour with the cable company...

73
00:03:25,456 --> 00:03:27,022
Lea's pregnant.

74
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:36,910
You want to have...

75
00:03:36,934 --> 00:03:38,511
Yes.

76
00:03:38,944 --> 00:03:41,013
Wow.

77
00:03:41,814 --> 00:03:43,091
I'm glad you're happy.

78
00:03:43,115 --> 00:03:46,194
Um, do you have any concerns?

79
00:03:46,618 --> 00:03:47,929
Yes.

80
00:03:47,953 --> 00:03:49,430
Sleep deprivation.

81
00:03:49,454 --> 00:03:52,900
But I have started looking
into an affordable night nurse.

82
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:56,654
Well, there's gonna be
some bigger issues.

83
00:03:56,678 --> 00:03:58,256
I mean, this is a...

84
00:03:59,681 --> 00:04:03,652
This is a gigantic moment for anyone,

85
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:06,256
especially... Especially for you.

86
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,748
You mean...

87
00:04:08,447 --> 00:04:09,524
because of my ASD?

88
00:04:09,548 --> 00:04:12,669
Yeah, because of your
ASD. Because of your family.

89
00:04:14,753 --> 00:04:15,997
Your job.

90
00:04:16,021 --> 00:04:17,966
I mean...

91
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,001
A million things.

92
00:04:20,025 --> 00:04:22,170
I don't want to tell you
what... what to...

93
00:04:22,194 --> 00:04:23,930
I mean, I don't even know what I...

94
00:04:27,032 --> 00:04:28,852
Having a child...

95
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:33,482
changes everything.

Synced & corrected by -robtor-

97
00:04:52,324 --> 00:04:53,969
Nasal cavity's clear.

98
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:57,973
There's no abscess,
facial tumor, or sinusitis.

99
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:00,041
It could be acoustic neuroma.

100
00:05:00,065 --> 00:05:01,810
Without any hearing loss?

101
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:03,178
Let's do an MRI to check.

102
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:04,379
We've run eight negative tests already.

103
00:05:04,403 --> 00:05:05,547
We don't need a ninth.

104
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:07,215
We do the tests
till we know what he has.

105
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:08,783
It's fibromyalgia.

106
00:05:08,807 --> 00:05:10,385
So, your diagnosis for his pain

107
00:05:10,409 --> 00:05:12,420
is "pain that no one can explain"?

108
00:05:12,444 --> 00:05:14,956
- Well done.
- Some pain's unavoidable.

109
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,258
When I was competing in Tae Kwon Do,

110
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:18,894
they taught us to adjust
our relationship to it,

111
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:19,995
learn to tolerate it.

112
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:21,196
It can make you stronger.

113
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,398
Wow. That statement has
the absolute ideal ratio

114
00:05:23,422 --> 00:05:25,867
of heartlessness,
humble-bragging, and machismo.

115
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:27,002
Bravo.

116
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:29,171
Seriously? You're pleased with that?

117
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:31,139
"Machismo," Spanish, "bravo"'s Italian.

118
00:05:31,163 --> 00:05:32,741
And "humble-bragging" 's 2011.

119
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:34,910
We can do better, don't you think?

120
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:39,247
Maybe we're not finding anything
because it's psychological?

121
00:05:39,271 --> 00:05:42,300
Some kind of conversion disorder?

122
00:05:43,475 --> 00:05:45,820
You do the MRI. I'll talk to the wife.

123
00:05:47,646 --> 00:05:50,434
Negative for endocrine issues.

124
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,695
He's got a history
of moderate carotid stenosis.

125
00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:55,263
If enough plaque builds up,

126
00:05:55,287 --> 00:05:56,464
starves the brain of oxygen,

127
00:05:56,488 --> 00:05:57,866
maybe could cause the hand problems.

128
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,669
If it got that bad, we'd have
already seen signs of a stroke.

129
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,111
Anyone else annoyed
that we're wasting

130
00:06:02,135 --> 00:06:04,739
all these resources to confirm
what's clearly carpal tunnel?

131
00:06:04,763 --> 00:06:07,275
He may be a jerk,
but he's a great doctor.

132
00:06:07,299 --> 00:06:09,144
If Silas Chambers has a medical opinion,

133
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:10,378
we better check it out.

134
00:06:10,402 --> 00:06:12,539
I didn't think he was a jerk.

135
00:06:14,506 --> 00:06:17,352
Dr. Andrews and Dr. Lim
also criticize us

136
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:19,054
and have particular demands.

137
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:21,156
Yeah. They want us to improve.

138
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,592
How do you know Dr. Chambers doesn't?

139
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:25,215
He did improve Enrique.

140
00:06:26,585 --> 00:06:27,996
Not kidding.

141
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,664
You look snazzy.

142
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:38,540
I know what Dr. Chambers has.

143
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:41,209
We're having trouble finding
a physical basis

144
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:42,799
for your husband's pain.

145
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,248
And you defended me when I asked him

146
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:48,338
about painkillers earlier.

147
00:06:55,347 --> 00:06:59,928
A few years ago,
Oscar was on a job site.

148
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:01,563
Working crazy hours.

149
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,423
He was exhausted.

150
00:07:04,256 --> 00:07:06,368
He shot himself with a...
With a nail gun.

151
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:08,220
Right through his palm.

152
00:07:08,994 --> 00:07:10,405
We didn't have insurance,

153
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:15,210
so we went to this clinic, and, um...

154
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:16,811
Opioids?

155
00:07:17,803 --> 00:07:19,614
Really bad.

156
00:07:19,638 --> 00:07:22,943
Took a year for him to kick.

157
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:28,740
Now, um... he's taking
more pills than ever.

158
00:07:29,548 --> 00:07:32,994
Whenever I talk to him
about getting help,

159
00:07:33,018 --> 00:07:34,996
he just gets mad.

160
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,665
I, uh...

161
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:40,293
I had to move out last week.

162
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,994
I'm only here because he asked me to.

163
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,333
I think he's faking.

164
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:56,751
You threw 113 sutures
in your last day of surgery.

165
00:07:56,775 --> 00:08:00,088
In at least half, I detected
a very subtle tremor.

166
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:03,925
Congratulations on discovering
a symptom I told you about.

167
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:05,894
It occurs during the part of your stitch

168
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:08,563
when the wrist is straight,
not when it's bent.

169
00:08:08,587 --> 00:08:10,231
That is not carpal tunnel.

170
00:08:10,255 --> 00:08:12,167
It is musician's dystonia.

171
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:14,469
My wrist flexes on every suture.

172
00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:16,671
You're talking about
a difference of milliseconds.

173
00:08:16,695 --> 00:08:18,540
Yes, he is.

174
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:21,743
Your condition was probably
caused by your repetitive technique.

175
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:24,346
Even Dr. Andrews throws sutures
in varied ways.

176
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,581
You never do.
This kind of obsessive behavior

177
00:08:26,605 --> 00:08:28,883
is common for those with autism.

178
00:08:28,907 --> 00:08:30,118
So, I can refer...

179
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:31,675
What did you just say?

180
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:36,365
I'm not autistic.

181
00:08:43,288 --> 00:08:45,359
Dr. Murphy didn't mean
any offense.

182
00:08:45,383 --> 00:08:47,972
He himself is on the spectrum.

183
00:08:47,997 --> 00:08:49,441
Oh, is he?

184
00:08:49,465 --> 00:08:52,244
I thought his robotic voice
and hand clasping

185
00:08:52,268 --> 00:08:53,812
were just charming affectations.

186
00:08:53,836 --> 00:08:56,915
Do you really think
I am anything like him?

187
00:08:56,939 --> 00:08:59,051
- I'm not saying that...
- I am.

188
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:00,850
You're extremely organized.

189
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,452
You hardly make eye contact.

190
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:04,704
And given your problems
with food, blankets,

191
00:09:04,729 --> 00:09:07,575
and lighting, plus the fact you
wear headphones even in surgery,

192
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,501
you clearly have sensory issues.

193
00:09:09,525 --> 00:09:11,236
I'm organized.

194
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,483
Would you rather I show up
in the O.R. and just wing it?

195
00:09:13,715 --> 00:09:14,992
I have good taste in food and music.

196
00:09:15,017 --> 00:09:17,204
Now that's a mental disorder?

197
00:09:17,774 --> 00:09:19,808
And as for eye contact...

198
00:09:22,419 --> 00:09:23,930
Okay.

199
00:09:23,954 --> 00:09:26,199
I didn't come here for a psych consult.

200
00:09:26,223 --> 00:09:29,253
It was just an observation
about a possible reason

201
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,621
for the behavior that led
to your hand symptoms,

202
00:09:31,646 --> 00:09:33,390
which is what we should
be talking about.

203
00:09:33,414 --> 00:09:36,360
Physical therapy is the
recommended course for dystonia.

204
00:09:36,384 --> 00:09:39,458
I'm not wasting months
on a treatment that won't work.

205
00:09:39,499 --> 00:09:41,644
I want an MRI-guided ultrasound ablation

206
00:09:41,668 --> 00:09:43,801
of the VO nucleus of the thalamus.

207
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,531
You want to jump to brain surgery?

208
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:51,600
I would jump right to amputating a toe

209
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:53,991
if it got me my career back.

210
00:10:00,213 --> 00:10:02,425
What were you thinking?

211
00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:04,043
You just supported me.

212
00:10:04,068 --> 00:10:06,914
Yes, because part of my job
is not yelling at residents

213
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,483
in front of patients.

214
00:10:08,854 --> 00:10:11,299
What you did is equivalent
to looking at a fuzzy MRI

215
00:10:11,324 --> 00:10:12,969
and blurting out a patient has cancer.

216
00:10:12,993 --> 00:10:15,193
Cancer can kill you.

217
00:10:17,087 --> 00:10:20,655
Neither diagnosis is one
a patient is excited to hear.

218
00:10:22,397 --> 00:10:24,108
Prep him for the ablation.

219
00:10:24,132 --> 00:10:27,578
And do not talk to him again
about autism.

220
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:35,276
He's seen six doctors in the last month,

221
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,778
gotten three opioid prescriptions,

222
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,901
and he had a previous opioid problem.

223
00:10:38,926 --> 00:10:40,537
It's textbook drug-seeking.

224
00:10:40,561 --> 00:10:42,338
It's also textbook "a bunch of dingbats

225
00:10:42,362 --> 00:10:44,441
missing a trigeminal neuralgia
diagnosis."

226
00:10:44,465 --> 00:10:46,309
Mm, his wife agrees with me.
She knows him.

227
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,777
Would explain why yours left you.

228
00:10:47,801 --> 00:10:50,246
Snap. Except my wife didn't leave me,

229
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,882
so neither a good point,
nor even a clever one.

230
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:54,900
FIESTA imaging would take hours
to set up,

231
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,345
cost the patient serious money,

232
00:10:56,378 --> 00:10:57,687
and still come out negative.

233
00:10:57,717 --> 00:11:01,037
Because... it's textbook drug-seeking.

234
00:11:01,726 --> 00:11:03,437
We have other patients who need us.

235
00:11:03,461 --> 00:11:05,339
I'm sending the discharge order.

236
00:11:11,669 --> 00:11:13,534
Hey.

237
00:11:22,392 --> 00:11:24,771
I hate poop.

238
00:11:24,795 --> 00:11:28,041
Like, what if I suck
at changing diapers?

239
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,671
Maybe we should start
with the bigger issues

240
00:11:30,695 --> 00:11:33,345
and work our way down.

241
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,144
This isn't at the top of my list,

242
00:11:36,168 --> 00:11:38,434
but since you are a doctor...

243
00:11:39,238 --> 00:11:41,282
Shaun's ASD... Is it...?

244
00:11:41,306 --> 00:11:43,021
Inheritable?

245
00:11:44,748 --> 00:11:46,259
Probably.

246
00:11:46,283 --> 00:11:48,695
But it's unclear how much.

247
00:11:48,961 --> 00:11:50,171
So, even that.

248
00:11:50,195 --> 00:11:52,273
W-What am I supposed to do with that?

249
00:11:52,297 --> 00:11:54,042
Think it through.

250
00:11:54,466 --> 00:11:58,101
Let's say you have a little baby Shaun.

251
00:12:00,238 --> 00:12:04,185
Like... tiny, honest,

252
00:12:04,685 --> 00:12:07,730
brilliant guy who adores me...

253
00:12:08,088 --> 00:12:10,967
Mini button-down,

254
00:12:11,525 --> 00:12:13,659
teeny blue eyes...

255
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:18,849
And me?

256
00:12:20,976 --> 00:12:22,512
A mom?

257
00:12:22,986 --> 00:12:25,245
I mean, I'm not saying
my life would be worse,

258
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,714
but it would just be so different

259
00:12:26,738 --> 00:12:28,315
from what I was planning.

260
00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:29,650
Not that I was really planning,

261
00:12:29,674 --> 00:12:36,056
but I am enjoying just... being.

262
00:12:36,674 --> 00:12:38,586
And so what if you wait?

263
00:12:38,611 --> 00:12:40,856
I just want to make sure
I'm making the right decision.

264
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,706
Mm-hmm.

265
00:12:47,993 --> 00:12:50,227
I guess you'll never really know.

266
00:12:52,216 --> 00:12:55,844
I had to make a lot
of hard choices about my mom.

267
00:12:57,112 --> 00:12:59,324
And I still wake up wondering

268
00:12:59,348 --> 00:13:01,214
which of them went the wrong way.

269
00:13:03,201 --> 00:13:07,648
But... you still gotta choose.

270
00:13:20,768 --> 00:13:23,254
No abnormal signal in the mid pons.

271
00:13:24,473 --> 00:13:26,618
So, are you and Dr. Park
like this at home, too?

272
00:13:26,642 --> 00:13:28,987
When I let him out
of his cage for meals, yes.

273
00:13:30,205 --> 00:13:31,845
Hey, we're almost...

274
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,137
Oh, come on.

275
00:13:37,161 --> 00:13:39,173
Did you not get the text
I didn't send about this?

276
00:13:39,197 --> 00:13:40,817
Don't bother asking for consults
if you're gonna...

277
00:13:40,841 --> 00:13:42,242
Wait.

278
00:13:42,266 --> 00:13:45,479
What's that on the right
superior cerebellar artery?

279
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:54,270
An abnormal loop causing compression.

280
00:13:54,294 --> 00:13:56,305
He has trigeminal neuralgia.

281
00:13:56,329 --> 00:13:57,740
The pain's real.

282
00:14:01,218 --> 00:14:04,263
We have good
visualization of the target area.

283
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:07,367
Connect the ultrasound
to the stereotactic frame.

284
00:14:24,408 --> 00:14:26,143
Ablation won't work.

285
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:28,254
You changed your mind?

286
00:14:28,278 --> 00:14:29,589
You don't think he has dystonia?

287
00:14:29,613 --> 00:14:32,025
He does, but it's a symptom.

288
00:14:32,049 --> 00:14:36,462
His vertebral artery takes
an aberrant course.

289
00:14:36,486 --> 00:14:38,831
It is pressing against his spinal cord.

290
00:14:38,855 --> 00:14:40,949
He needs vascular surgery or he'll die.

291
00:14:43,992 --> 00:14:46,124
It's a disorder of the nerve
that carries sensation

292
00:14:46,148 --> 00:14:47,541
from the face to the brain.

293
00:14:47,662 --> 00:14:50,455
And it's one of the most
painful conditions that exists.

294
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,233
And very hard to diagnose.

295
00:14:52,257 --> 00:14:54,819
Thank God Dr. Park approved
all those tests.

296
00:14:57,763 --> 00:15:00,041
Y-You were in agony.

297
00:15:00,491 --> 00:15:02,124
And I...

298
00:15:04,762 --> 00:15:07,262
I told him I thought you were lying.

299
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:12,777
You thought I was lying?

300
00:15:15,427 --> 00:15:17,961
You thought I was just being an addict.

301
00:15:21,363 --> 00:15:23,297
And still you came here with me.

302
00:15:25,773 --> 00:15:27,440
Sat at my side.

303
00:15:31,313 --> 00:15:34,092
We'd like to do
a microvascular decompression.

304
00:15:34,116 --> 00:15:35,875
We'd go in through the back
of your skull

305
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:39,461
and put in a Teflon patch
to cushion the affected nerve.

306
00:15:39,486 --> 00:15:41,464
You're... You're cutting into his brain?

307
00:15:41,488 --> 00:15:43,332
It's relatively safe. And other options

308
00:15:43,356 --> 00:15:45,501
are unlikely to relieve the pain.

309
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:49,020
Look, I-I'll do it.

310
00:15:49,055 --> 00:15:50,792
Uh, thank you so much.

311
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:55,096
We want to run
a vertebral artery BTO.

312
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,085
If you tolerate it,
then we would sacrifice the...

313
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:59,755
Sacrifice the vessel
with onyx embolization.

314
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,837
We recognize you might not love
this proposal.

315
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:03,772
The one in which
my hand weakness remains,

316
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,848
destroying my career?

317
00:16:07,325 --> 00:16:09,470
Did you consider
vertebral-to-vertebral artery bypass

318
00:16:09,494 --> 00:16:11,939
with physical removal
of the aberrant artery?

319
00:16:11,963 --> 00:16:16,203
Mm, that would carry a very high
risk for a stroke or bleed.

320
00:16:16,228 --> 00:16:19,474
It would fix the dystonia
and let me get back to work.

321
00:16:19,498 --> 00:16:21,743
With your history of carotid stenosis,

322
00:16:21,767 --> 00:16:23,945
it would be a coin flip
whether you survive.

323
00:16:23,969 --> 00:16:25,881
I can live with those numbers.

324
00:16:25,905 --> 00:16:28,483
Or, for that matter, die with them.

325
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,295
Corridor to the trigeminal
nerve origin is open.

326
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,364
I freed up the offending vessel.

327
00:16:37,388 --> 00:16:38,881
Teflon sponge.

328
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,203
The sponge is too big. It'll
compress the brain stem.

329
00:16:42,227 --> 00:16:43,938
I have at least 4 millimeters of room.

330
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:45,039
You have half that.

331
00:16:45,063 --> 00:16:47,374
Yes, you have a better view
50 feet away.

332
00:16:47,398 --> 00:16:48,509
How long have they been like this?

333
00:16:48,533 --> 00:16:50,511
- A while.
- It's getting worse, though.

334
00:16:50,535 --> 00:16:51,745
Sorry, Park, you're right.

335
00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:54,882
Just like you were when you
decided to discharge the sick guy.

336
00:16:54,906 --> 00:16:56,450
Wow, you invented sarcasm.

337
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:57,551
Really impressive.

338
00:16:57,575 --> 00:16:59,153
Hey, look at me, I'm using it, too.

339
00:16:59,177 --> 00:17:01,589
Park, you missed the diagnosis.

340
00:17:01,613 --> 00:17:03,591
Reznick, you ignored protocol.

341
00:17:03,615 --> 00:17:06,393
How about you both show
some humility and shut up?

342
00:17:06,417 --> 00:17:08,062
Sorry.

343
00:17:08,469 --> 00:17:10,380
Teflon's placed.

344
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,449
What if we used the saphenous
vein for the bypass?

345
00:17:12,473 --> 00:17:14,117
Not enough flow. He'll stroke out.

346
00:17:14,373 --> 00:17:15,817
Carotid to distal vert, then?

347
00:17:15,841 --> 00:17:17,552
Stenosis is too severe.

348
00:17:17,576 --> 00:17:19,130
Dude's loaded.

349
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,115
He's at retirement age.

350
00:17:21,139 --> 00:17:23,818
He could teach, travel,
screw around all day.

351
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:26,179
Why is he demanding that we do this?

352
00:17:27,363 --> 00:17:30,375
When you dedicate your life to
something that gives you meaning,

353
00:17:30,614 --> 00:17:32,492
it starts to define you.

354
00:17:32,516 --> 00:17:34,794
His decision may be irrational,
but I get it.

355
00:17:35,084 --> 00:17:37,231
I don't think it is irrational.

356
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:41,812
Dr. Chambers has no friends,
no children,

357
00:17:41,836 --> 00:17:43,447
no family, no outside interests.

358
00:17:43,471 --> 00:17:46,305
If he can't be a surgeon,
he'll have nothing.

359
00:17:49,594 --> 00:17:51,572
I think our best bet is a radial graft.

360
00:17:51,596 --> 00:17:53,664
Highest flow I can think of.

361
00:17:54,432 --> 00:17:56,444
Any other ideas?

362
00:17:56,468 --> 00:17:58,779
Okay. We go with the radial graft.

363
00:18:06,444 --> 00:18:07,721
I'm impressed.

364
00:18:07,745 --> 00:18:11,291
I was actually starting to
wonder if I was losing my touch.

365
00:18:11,676 --> 00:18:13,320
But then I had a dark afternoon
of the soul

366
00:18:13,344 --> 00:18:15,156
and suddenly I knew it...

367
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,058
Those were totally solid burns.

368
00:18:17,082 --> 00:18:21,195
Maybe not A+, but A-, B+ at the worst.

369
00:18:21,542 --> 00:18:25,155
So it hit me... your plan was
to throw me off my game,

370
00:18:25,179 --> 00:18:26,407
make me doubt myself...

371
00:18:26,432 --> 00:18:27,782
I'm attracted to you.

372
00:18:29,884 --> 00:18:31,696
I've been fighting this stupid feeling,

373
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:36,167
trying to find reasons to not... feel.

374
00:18:43,105 --> 00:18:44,716
Are you kidding me?

375
00:18:51,845 --> 00:18:52,990
Yes.

376
00:18:53,206 --> 00:18:54,450
Your jokes were lame.

377
00:18:54,474 --> 00:18:56,474
And that's how you screw with someone.

378
00:18:57,744 --> 00:18:59,689
No.

379
00:18:59,713 --> 00:19:01,983
You're not that good of a liar.

380
00:19:04,001 --> 00:19:06,485
I-I can't have a roommate
who has feelings for me.

381
00:19:06,509 --> 00:19:07,819
Since when can't you take a joke?

382
00:19:07,843 --> 00:19:09,810
Since my roommate hit on me.

383
00:19:12,081 --> 00:19:14,059
You have to move out.

384
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,927
As soon as possible.

385
00:19:28,192 --> 00:19:30,671
We've decided to use your
radial artery for the graft.

386
00:19:30,695 --> 00:19:32,425
We've scheduled an O.R.
for tomorrow morning.

387
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:34,108
- Good call.
- I agree.

388
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:36,823
You should risk your life
for this surgery.

389
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,831
Are you being facetious?

390
00:19:39,855 --> 00:19:41,232
No.

391
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:46,572
It just boggles the mind.

392
00:19:46,873 --> 00:19:48,851
You can't understand what anyone means.

393
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,986
You can't express yourself
like an adult.

394
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:53,868
You're a child playing dress-up.

395
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:55,913
And everyone here just plays along.

396
00:19:55,937 --> 00:19:57,248
Let's go, Shaun.

397
00:19:57,272 --> 00:19:58,534
Y-You're agitated.

398
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:00,318
I'm fine.

399
00:20:00,502 --> 00:20:02,380
You are rubbing your mug.

400
00:20:02,404 --> 00:20:05,991
People with ASD
often have comfort objects

401
00:20:06,016 --> 00:20:07,494
for when they become agitated.

402
00:20:07,518 --> 00:20:10,430
I can order you Propranolol.

403
00:20:10,618 --> 00:20:12,129
You're gonna give me
the Ruseckas-Freedman

404
00:20:12,153 --> 00:20:13,797
ASD Diagnostic Questionnaire,

405
00:20:13,821 --> 00:20:15,799
and that's gonna shut your damn mouth.

406
00:20:15,823 --> 00:20:17,635
Okay, the "Rafad-Q" is just a tool.

407
00:20:17,659 --> 00:20:20,867
An official diagnosis needs
to come from a psychiatrist.

408
00:20:20,892 --> 00:20:22,269
Well, since I might be dead tomorrow,

409
00:20:22,293 --> 00:20:24,527
this is your next-best option.

410
00:20:29,052 --> 00:20:31,720
I'll get the test.

411
00:20:35,486 --> 00:20:37,297
Why can't you treat people
with just an ounce of respect?

412
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:40,985
Respect has to be earned,
not doled out like candy.

413
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,687
No, that's just an excuse
people like you use

414
00:20:42,711 --> 00:20:44,255
to justify your garbage behavior.

415
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:45,790
That's just an excuse people
like you use

416
00:20:45,814 --> 00:20:47,859
to avoid facing reality.

417
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:51,603
No one was respectful to me
when I was a resident.

418
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:54,372
They were dismissive and cruel.

419
00:20:54,396 --> 00:20:57,609
But it lit a fire and it made me
the man I am today.

420
00:20:57,633 --> 00:21:01,161
The man that you came
into my room idolizing.

421
00:21:02,004 --> 00:21:03,048
Not anymore.

422
00:21:03,072 --> 00:21:04,738
I'm devastated.

423
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:09,354
Surgeons deal in human lives,

424
00:21:09,378 --> 00:21:11,256
not childish fantasies.

425
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,124
If you want to succeed,

426
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:16,127
you're gonna have to be
a lot more like me.

427
00:21:28,297 --> 00:21:29,240
Everything okay?

428
00:21:29,264 --> 00:21:31,709
- Yep.
- Surgery went very smoothly.

429
00:21:31,733 --> 00:21:33,211
No pain right now.

430
00:21:33,235 --> 00:21:35,235
Want to take it for a test drive?

431
00:21:52,893 --> 00:21:54,359
It's worse.

432
00:21:56,803 --> 00:21:59,449
Collateral circulation is not ideal.

433
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,013
How are we gonna harvest the artery?

434
00:22:05,434 --> 00:22:07,537
What's going on?

435
00:22:08,704 --> 00:22:11,082
How much am I gonna have to
change who I am to be a surgeon?

436
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:14,244
Ah, to be great...
Or even good... at anything,

437
00:22:14,268 --> 00:22:16,070
we have to compromise.

438
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:20,030
I used to get too emotionally
involved in my work,

439
00:22:20,055 --> 00:22:22,603
with patients, everyone.

440
00:22:22,637 --> 00:22:24,715
And I had to learn to distance myself.

441
00:22:24,739 --> 00:22:26,550
Yeah, you've really grown cold
and heartless.

442
00:22:26,574 --> 00:22:28,018
I have changed.

443
00:22:28,042 --> 00:22:30,087
We all end up changing.

444
00:22:30,111 --> 00:22:32,611
You just got to try
and make it a good change.

445
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:37,213
I don't want to change.

446
00:22:40,118 --> 00:22:42,619
I want to change what's around me.

447
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:47,468
Oh, I'll figure it out.

448
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:48,970
I'm sure you will.

449
00:22:48,994 --> 00:22:51,672
Hey, you're the guy who makes
living in a van look cool.

450
00:22:54,366 --> 00:22:56,210
So, uh, the circulation...

451
00:22:56,234 --> 00:22:59,380
The right side looks like
it has better length.

452
00:22:59,404 --> 00:23:01,782
Yeah. Better collateral, too.

453
00:23:06,645 --> 00:23:07,989
Given the poor outcome,

454
00:23:08,013 --> 00:23:10,424
we can't recommend
further surgery right now.

455
00:23:10,448 --> 00:23:12,393
We suggest six months of pain medication

456
00:23:12,417 --> 00:23:16,764
and referrals to neurology
and pain management specialists.

457
00:23:17,325 --> 00:23:20,037
W-What surgery aren't you recommending?

458
00:23:20,061 --> 00:23:21,739
A DREZ lesioning.

459
00:23:21,763 --> 00:23:23,507
We'd cut the signal
from the trigeminal nerve

460
00:23:23,531 --> 00:23:25,342
to the sensory areas of your brain.

461
00:23:25,366 --> 00:23:28,045
But there's a real possibility
of paralysis

462
00:23:28,069 --> 00:23:30,581
on one side of your body.

463
00:23:31,078 --> 00:23:32,355
I want the surgery.

464
00:23:32,379 --> 00:23:34,958
Baby, I'll help you manage
the pain.

465
00:23:34,982 --> 00:23:37,861
I-I'll move back in.

466
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:39,888
I'll take care of you.

467
00:23:39,912 --> 00:23:42,739
You know how I treated you before.

468
00:23:43,682 --> 00:23:46,194
I'm only gonna get worse.

469
00:23:46,603 --> 00:23:49,268
I would never leave you again.

470
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:52,367
That's what scares me.

471
00:23:52,391 --> 00:23:55,437
I'd start cutting you down,

472
00:23:55,461 --> 00:23:57,396
being cruel,

473
00:23:58,063 --> 00:23:59,774
and you'd just put up with it.

474
00:24:02,092 --> 00:24:04,345
I won't let that happen.

475
00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:10,309
We'll prep an O.R.

476
00:24:13,704 --> 00:24:16,416
"I frequently point out
other people's mistakes."

477
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,718
Duh.

478
00:24:17,742 --> 00:24:19,276
That's a yes.

479
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:22,080
"People tell me I overthink things."

480
00:24:22,104 --> 00:24:24,282
Only people who underthink things.

481
00:24:24,673 --> 00:24:26,251
But, fine, another yes.

482
00:24:26,275 --> 00:24:28,353
"I sometimes speak in an abnormal tone."

483
00:24:28,377 --> 00:24:30,321
Who thinks they speak
in an abnormal tone?

484
00:24:30,345 --> 00:24:31,723
Just mark no.

485
00:24:31,747 --> 00:24:33,291
How many more of these?

486
00:24:33,315 --> 00:24:34,750
None.

487
00:24:36,018 --> 00:24:39,338
Your answers are fully congruent
with someone on the spectrum.

488
00:24:40,289 --> 00:24:41,332
No.

489
00:24:41,356 --> 00:24:42,300
You keyed it wrong.

490
00:24:42,324 --> 00:24:43,735
No, look. No, I... Or something.

491
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:45,403
- Here. Look, I didn't.
- No, give it to me.

492
00:24:45,427 --> 00:24:46,571
- No, I...
- Oh! Don't!

493
00:24:49,848 --> 00:24:51,559
You idiot!

494
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:53,127
S-Stupid, careless...

495
00:24:53,151 --> 00:24:54,362
I-I stepped back...

496
00:24:54,386 --> 00:24:56,397
Get out of my room.

497
00:24:56,776 --> 00:24:58,087
- Get out!
- Okay.

498
00:25:05,797 --> 00:25:07,007
Make sure we're not impacting

499
00:25:07,031 --> 00:25:08,308
normal spinal cord pathways.

500
00:25:08,332 --> 00:25:10,477
Somatosensories are at baseline.

501
00:25:10,501 --> 00:25:12,162
BP's steady.

502
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,482
Leg and arm SSEPs
at 50% decreased amplitude.

503
00:25:18,507 --> 00:25:20,251
Check the cord above and below
for hematoma

504
00:25:20,275 --> 00:25:21,953
or bony compression.

505
00:25:21,977 --> 00:25:23,187
Cord's fine.

506
00:25:23,211 --> 00:25:25,022
Push IV fluids and start pressors.

507
00:25:25,046 --> 00:25:26,635
So, what is it?

508
00:25:27,215 --> 00:25:29,048
I don't know.

509
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:36,201
Any issues with motor potentials?

510
00:25:36,226 --> 00:25:38,037
Unilateral amplitude down 70%.

511
00:25:38,061 --> 00:25:39,839
We're about to get
total neurological collapse.

512
00:25:39,863 --> 00:25:41,962
It's a clot
from a small branch artery.

513
00:25:41,987 --> 00:25:43,531
We checked the spinal blood vessels...

514
00:25:43,555 --> 00:25:44,799
The outside.

515
00:25:44,823 --> 00:25:47,001
But the electrode could have
injured a sulcal artery.

516
00:25:47,025 --> 00:25:48,536
We need to follow
the DREZ pathway inward

517
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,971
and search for a small clot.

518
00:25:49,995 --> 00:25:52,139
Start at the site of last
ablation with the electrode.

519
00:25:52,163 --> 00:25:53,902
It's gotta be deep.

520
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,280
This'll be easier if she's in here.

521
00:25:57,769 --> 00:25:59,714
Scrub in, Dr. Reznick.

522
00:26:04,995 --> 00:26:06,640
We're setting up
the neuromonitoring

523
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:08,398
for Silas' surgery.

524
00:26:11,416 --> 00:26:12,793
He's angry with me.

525
00:26:12,817 --> 00:26:14,395
Silas?

526
00:26:14,797 --> 00:26:16,008
He's angry with everyone.

527
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:19,011
Dr. Andrews said to stop
talking to him about ASD.

528
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:21,079
But I brought it up anyway,
gave him a test,

529
00:26:21,103 --> 00:26:24,750
his mug broke,
and I don't know what to do now.

530
00:26:24,774 --> 00:26:25,851
I don't know what to feel.

531
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,708
And Lea...

532
00:26:30,111 --> 00:26:33,546
Lea told me about the pregnancy.

533
00:26:40,523 --> 00:26:41,833
Okay.

534
00:26:48,222 --> 00:26:49,666
Is this hard for me because I'm dealing

535
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:51,624
with both things at once?

536
00:26:53,594 --> 00:26:56,028
I think both things are related.

537
00:27:00,193 --> 00:27:01,803
What if my child...

538
00:27:02,562 --> 00:27:04,907
has no friends?

539
00:27:04,931 --> 00:27:06,342
What if they're picked on?

540
00:27:06,366 --> 00:27:08,077
This is not small-town Wyoming.

541
00:27:08,101 --> 00:27:09,345
The world has changed, Shaun.

542
00:27:09,369 --> 00:27:11,714
I haven't changed.

543
00:27:12,065 --> 00:27:13,465
How can I...

544
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:17,318
...know what they're feeling?

545
00:27:17,342 --> 00:27:19,362
How can I comfort them?

546
00:27:21,881 --> 00:27:24,248
How can I be a good father?

547
00:27:28,805 --> 00:27:30,850
Remember when we first met?

548
00:27:30,874 --> 00:27:32,750
Right over there?

549
00:27:34,227 --> 00:27:35,471
You were mad at me.

550
00:27:35,495 --> 00:27:38,774
Yeah. But you were right
about the patient.

551
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:41,335
And you were stubborn. And crazy smart.

552
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,636
And you are still all of those things.

553
00:27:44,695 --> 00:27:49,520
But if you were still just that guy

554
00:27:49,545 --> 00:27:51,123
that I met running through those doors,

555
00:27:51,148 --> 00:27:53,248
we would not be sitting here right now.

556
00:27:55,887 --> 00:27:57,820
You have changed.

557
00:27:59,257 --> 00:28:01,696
You've adapted. You've grown.

558
00:28:02,827 --> 00:28:04,169
Do you know how hard that is?

559
00:28:04,193 --> 00:28:05,995
Most people don't even try.

560
00:28:08,466 --> 00:28:14,915
And you are going to grow
into a great father.

561
00:28:14,939 --> 00:28:17,117
Whenever it happens.

562
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,314
Slowly go perpendicular

563
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:36,622
at the angle of our ablation electrode.

564
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:39,527
Still not seeing the clot.

565
00:28:39,713 --> 00:28:42,359
Amplitude loss at 80%.

566
00:28:42,384 --> 00:28:43,661
Maybe it's not a clot.

567
00:28:43,686 --> 00:28:45,731
Maybe it's something higher up,
in the brain.

568
00:28:45,756 --> 00:28:48,342
No. You were right the first time.

569
00:28:48,684 --> 00:28:53,097
Maybe it's hiding behind some
ultrasound-impervious segment.

570
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:55,875
Cut the dentate ligament.

571
00:28:56,425 --> 00:28:58,704
It'll get more lateral access.

572
00:28:58,728 --> 00:29:00,372
Completely section the ligament.

573
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:05,966
I see it.

574
00:29:08,701 --> 00:29:10,530
Removing the clot.

575
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,471
Amplitude returning
to normal baseline.

576
00:29:22,451 --> 00:29:24,129
Let me know if you need me.

577
00:29:24,153 --> 00:29:25,364
We're good.

578
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:26,932
Thank you.

579
00:29:32,662 --> 00:29:34,038
Hey.

580
00:29:35,298 --> 00:29:37,209
We did good together.

581
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:38,299
We did.

582
00:29:40,169 --> 00:29:41,547
You still have to move out, though.

583
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:43,282
Tonight.

584
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:54,860
On my first day here, Dr. Melendez said

585
00:29:54,884 --> 00:29:57,563
I would never do anything
besides suction.

586
00:29:57,587 --> 00:30:00,899
But later, he let me make
my first surgical incision.

587
00:30:01,318 --> 00:30:03,496
He became my friend.

588
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,864
I miss him.

589
00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:06,833
Are you in the right room?

590
00:30:06,857 --> 00:30:10,604
Did somebody tell you
I needed pointless stories?

591
00:30:10,628 --> 00:30:13,006
I used to think

592
00:30:13,402 --> 00:30:17,582
being a doctor was
all I needed to make me happy.

593
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:21,920
It did make me happy.

594
00:30:22,295 --> 00:30:25,048
But I realized I wanted more.

595
00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:28,134
And that I could have more.

596
00:30:30,653 --> 00:30:32,419
I changed.

597
00:30:34,991 --> 00:30:37,636
You can change, too.

598
00:30:37,846 --> 00:30:40,113
But not if you're dead
from this surgery.

599
00:30:42,315 --> 00:30:44,743
I've made up my mind.

600
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:47,112
Please leave.

601
00:30:47,753 --> 00:30:49,331
My brother Steve,

602
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,445
he gave me a plastic scalpel
before he died.

603
00:30:52,469 --> 00:30:54,280
It broke. I was very sad.

604
00:30:54,304 --> 00:30:56,483
I asked you to leave.

605
00:31:02,312 --> 00:31:05,692
When I fixed my scalpel,
it made me feel better.

606
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:24,488
I was 9 years old when my father died.

607
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,032
I loved drinking hot chocolate
with him in the morning.

608
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:35,868
He'd bring me a mug
after every business trip.

609
00:31:37,094 --> 00:31:38,788
He understood me.

610
00:31:39,429 --> 00:31:40,873
My mother didn't.

611
00:31:40,897 --> 00:31:42,842
Nobody did.

612
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:47,463
I tried fitting in, but...

613
00:31:48,005 --> 00:31:49,682
I got frustrated.

614
00:31:49,706 --> 00:31:53,152
So I gave up.

615
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,314
On relationships.

616
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,124
On friends.

617
00:31:57,148 --> 00:32:01,617
On all but the one thing I was good at.

618
00:32:04,042 --> 00:32:07,088
And now, Dr. Murphy, I'm too old.

619
00:32:07,112 --> 00:32:09,023
I've made too many enemies.

620
00:32:09,047 --> 00:32:11,404
Too many mistakes.

621
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:18,369
People tolerate me because I save lives.

622
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:23,441
Without that...

623
00:32:24,725 --> 00:32:28,839
why would anyone ever care about me?

624
00:32:33,067 --> 00:32:34,677
I care.

625
00:33:14,734 --> 00:33:16,469
That smells good.

626
00:33:17,304 --> 00:33:18,904
Bland.

627
00:33:20,072 --> 00:33:22,050
Mm, pasta with olive oil.

628
00:33:22,074 --> 00:33:24,560
Kinda puke-proof.

629
00:33:25,511 --> 00:33:28,990
Have you thought any more about...

630
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,733
Yes.

631
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,965
I made a list.

632
00:33:51,854 --> 00:33:53,999
I guess I've learned from you.

633
00:34:02,065 --> 00:34:04,076
What's the first thing yours says?

634
00:34:09,538 --> 00:34:12,358
That I think I would be a good father...

635
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:17,655
but that I can't know for sure.

636
00:34:18,447 --> 00:34:20,658
You'd make a great dad.

637
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,762
It's on my list.

638
00:34:31,427 --> 00:34:33,296
You were right.

639
00:34:35,089 --> 00:34:37,133
It is very complicated.

640
00:34:38,634 --> 00:34:42,054
But I do know...

641
00:34:45,324 --> 00:34:47,635
...I want you to be happy, Lea.

642
00:34:51,663 --> 00:34:55,298
I have so many reasons to do this.

643
00:34:59,196 --> 00:35:01,407
And so many doubts.

644
00:35:02,575 --> 00:35:04,774
I'm just scared, Shaun.

645
00:35:07,085 --> 00:35:11,258
But if we are both having doubts,

646
00:35:11,283 --> 00:35:16,497
then maybe now isn't the right time.

647
00:35:21,861 --> 00:35:23,205
Okay.

648
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:10,849
Mm.

649
00:36:10,873 --> 00:36:12,484
I see that my hemoglobin's stable

650
00:36:12,508 --> 00:36:14,886
and my white count is fine.

651
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:17,622
Yeah. We just wrote
your discharge orders.

652
00:36:17,646 --> 00:36:21,248
This is a referral
for an ASD specialist.

653
00:36:23,364 --> 00:36:25,131
I can look into that on my own.

654
00:36:37,886 --> 00:36:39,820
Thank you, Dr. Murphy.

655
00:36:42,124 --> 00:36:44,191
And thank you, Dr. Guerin.

656
00:36:55,317 --> 00:36:56,494
Welcome back.

657
00:36:56,518 --> 00:36:58,163
Mm.

658
00:37:04,026 --> 00:37:05,663
Did it work?

659
00:37:06,228 --> 00:37:08,173
Let's find out.

660
00:37:18,207 --> 00:37:19,885
Mm.

661
00:37:27,616 --> 00:37:29,395
Your hand's cold.

662
00:37:46,435 --> 00:37:48,213
I'm transferring out.

663
00:37:48,237 --> 00:37:51,016
Last year, I applied to
a program at Johns Hopkins.

664
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,717
They train doctors to travel the world,

665
00:37:52,741 --> 00:37:54,953
help out needy areas.

666
00:37:54,977 --> 00:37:57,006
They'll let me enroll late.

667
00:37:57,479 --> 00:38:00,647
Sounds like a good place for you.

668
00:38:02,551 --> 00:38:04,996
Thanks for always being a great boss.

669
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,865
And a great friend.

670
00:38:06,889 --> 00:38:10,853
Can't have been that great,
sneaking out like this.

671
00:38:11,293 --> 00:38:14,572
Uh, actually, for the first time
I can remember,

672
00:38:14,596 --> 00:38:16,541
it felt hard to say goodbye.

673
00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:29,372
You're always doing so much
for other people.

674
00:38:30,112 --> 00:38:31,690
Please don't forget to do
something for yourself

675
00:38:31,714 --> 00:38:33,391
every now and then.

676
00:38:55,771 --> 00:38:57,816
Were you messing with me or not?

677
00:39:04,213 --> 00:39:06,747
If I was, would you let me stay?

678
00:39:10,586 --> 00:39:12,119
Yes.

679
00:39:16,151 --> 00:39:18,351
I wasn't messing with you.

680
00:39:22,731 --> 00:39:25,777
Then I guess it's good
we're not roommates anymore.

681
00:39:30,005 --> 00:39:32,083
'Cause I couldn't do this.

682
00:39:35,577 --> 00:39:37,722
This is a one-time thing.

683
00:39:37,746 --> 00:39:39,057
Unless I change my mind.

684
00:39:39,081 --> 00:39:42,361
So consider that an incentive.

685
00:40:33,168 --> 00:40:34,997
Lea Dilallo?

686
00:40:53,188 --> 00:40:56,310
She called your name.

687
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:06,110
I spent all day reminding myself
of all the reasons

688
00:41:06,134 --> 00:41:08,613
why this was a good idea.

689
00:41:11,139 --> 00:41:12,784
But now that it's actually happening,

690
00:41:12,808 --> 00:41:16,187
it... doesn't make me feel any better.

691
00:41:16,211 --> 00:41:19,390
It just makes me feel really sad.

692
00:41:26,355 --> 00:41:30,501
Maybe it's not the right time,
but will it ever be?

693
00:41:41,303 --> 00:41:42,731
I...

694
00:41:45,841 --> 00:41:47,185
...feel the same.

695
00:41:53,048 --> 00:41:55,960
Are we really doing this?

696
00:41:58,387 --> 00:42:00,131
We...

697
00:42:01,056 --> 00:42:03,268
...are having a baby.

698
00:42:07,462 --> 00:42:08,882
Mm.

699
00:42:11,433 --> 00:42:12,644
Yes.

700
00:42:19,641 --> 00:42:21,452
Yeah?

701
00:42:21,476 --> 00:42:22,854
Okay.

702
00:42:22,878 --> 00:42:23,917
Okay.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
