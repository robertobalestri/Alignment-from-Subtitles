1
00:00:09,498 --> 00:00:11,939
I'd have my work, my friends.

2
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:15,037
But someone in your life all the time?

3
00:00:16,486 --> 00:00:17,965
More trouble than it's worth.

4
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,985
Okay. Crib goes here.

5
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:21,700
Apparently, I got over it.

6
00:00:21,701 --> 00:00:26,180
Changing table will go... right here.

I mean, that--
you're gonna jinx the adoption.

10
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:35,090
No, the social worker wants
to see where we live.

11
00:00:35,091 --> 00:00:36,287
This is like a death trap.

12
00:00:36,288 --> 00:00:38,751
- I'm trying to create a
reasonable distraction. - Oh.

13
00:00:38,883 --> 00:00:41,875
Hello. 
Janet, welcome.

14
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,681
How are you? Thanks for coming out.

15
00:00:43,682 --> 00:00:45,361

I'll see you after the intake, okay?

22
00:01:07,989 --> 00:01:11,241
Okay. Oh, God.
I forgot it was the Hobarts today.

23
00:01:11,242 --> 00:01:13,468
It always bums me out when we
have an Alzheimer's patient

24
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:15,745
with young kids.
Well, there's no shame in sitting this one out.

25
00:01:15,746 --> 00:01:18,093
I can do the intake.
Stop treating me like I'm your wife.

26
00:01:18,094 --> 00:01:19,821
On the trial, I'm a colleague.

27
00:01:19,842 --> 00:01:21,506
I'm allowed to say it bums me out.

28
00:01:21,507 --> 00:01:23,626
Doesn't mean you have to feed
me warm milk and run a bath.

29
00:01:23,627 --> 00:01:24,816
Treat me like a doctor. 
Right.

30
00:01:24,817 --> 00:01:27,193
Sorry. Okay. Go do the intake, colleague.

31
00:01:29,825 --> 00:01:31,086
Shepherd, you got a minute?

32
00:01:31,087 --> 00:01:33,182
I need to talk to you about your trial.

33
00:01:33,739 --> 00:01:35,617
Oh, um... well, I should get Meredith.

34
00:01:35,618 --> 00:01:38,062
I just got a lecture on
the failure to extend

35
00:01:38,063 --> 00:01:39,648
professional courtesy to one's spouse.

36
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:41,520
I think it's best you don't get Meredith.

37
00:01:46,243 --> 00:01:47,937
You're in-- in very good hands.

38
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,439
I still feel bad that
I'm not gonna be here.

39
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,561
For the surgery?
I'll be unconscious.

40
00:01:52,562 --> 00:01:54,026
That's not when I'm gonna miss you.

41
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,655
Okay. Then I guess I w--

42
00:01:57,656 --> 00:01:59,752
You can feel bad about all
the time that follows.

43
00:02:00,085 --> 00:02:02,254
You know, when I'm not
under general anesthesia,

44
00:02:02,629 --> 00:02:03,586
and you're still not here.

45
00:02:03,587 --> 00:02:05,179
You're halfway around the world...

46
00:02:06,577 --> 00:02:07,410
With Arnold.

47
00:02:07,575 --> 00:02:09,497
Andrew. Raah!

48
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,853
Excuse me? 
He's a rock star.

49
00:02:12,702 --> 00:02:13,277
I kind of feel like

50
00:02:13,288 --> 00:02:15,280
the sound of an adoring crowd
should follow his name.

51
00:02:15,281 --> 00:02:16,969
I don't--I don't...

52
00:02:17,402 --> 00:02:19,503
Is that a compliment or an insult?
I don't know. I guess

53
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,427
it depends on how you
feel about rock stars.

54
00:02:21,428 --> 00:02:22,610
Okay, well, Andrew is not a rock st--

55
00:02:22,779 --> 00:02:24,565
- Raah! - Okay, you know what?
Can you stop that, please?

56
00:02:24,566 --> 00:02:25,709
It's starting to get annoying.

57
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,462
My wife's leaving.
I'm allowed to be annoying.

58
00:02:32,873 --> 00:02:33,639
I'm not a real wife,

59
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,165
so that doesn't buy for
a lot of bad behavior.

60
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:38,062
Well, you're my real best friend.
What does that get me?

61
00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:40,399
I'm sorry.

62
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,664
Don't be. Go be happy... with Andrew. 
Raah!

63
00:02:45,976 --> 00:02:47,201
You're impossible.

64
00:02:53,862 --> 00:02:54,846
Yeah, you, too.

65
00:02:56,993 --> 00:02:59,755
Meredith, tell me exactly what you did.

66
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,986
I can't tell you.

67
00:03:02,987 --> 00:03:04,020
We can still fix this,

68
00:03:04,021 --> 00:03:05,589
but I need to know what you did.

69
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,391
If I tell you, it'll make it worse.

70
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,034
It's worse already.
Meredith--

71
00:03:09,057 --> 00:03:11,721
Listen, I-I... I love you.

72
00:03:12,364 --> 00:03:13,485
And I'm sorry.

73
00:03:14,164 --> 00:03:15,549
But I can't tell you anything.

74
00:03:20,004 --> 00:03:21,287
You wanted to be treated like a colleague?

75
00:03:21,288 --> 00:03:22,560
I'm gonna treat you like a colleague.

76
00:03:24,045 --> 00:03:25,543
Alex Karev informed Dr. Hunt

77
00:03:25,544 --> 00:03:28,679
that Dr. Grey tampered
with my clinical trial.

78
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,674
She switched around the
placebos and the drugs,

79
00:03:31,675 --> 00:03:34,555
probably invalidating... my trial.

80
00:03:36,187 --> 00:03:37,129
Is this true?

81
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:40,282
Nothing I did has any effect--
Tell me exactly what happened.

82
00:03:40,283 --> 00:03:43,003
I can't do that.
Do you have any idea what you've done?

83
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:46,639
You think the F.D.A. will get anywhere
near this hospital ever again?

84
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,113
Meredith, look at me.

85
00:03:51,268 --> 00:03:53,925
If this is wrong, if there
is something going on,

86
00:03:54,043 --> 00:03:56,075
if Karev is exaggerating,

87
00:03:56,511 --> 00:03:58,711
this is the part where you have to tell me.

88
00:03:59,087 --> 00:04:01,992
This is the part where you
have to deny the charges.

89
00:04:03,303 --> 00:04:04,652
Kick me off the study.

90
00:04:05,544 --> 00:04:08,107
There's nothing wrong with the study.

91
00:04:08,108 --> 00:04:10,269
Nothing I did changes anything.

92
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,087
But you're not denying it?

93
00:04:14,626 --> 00:04:16,800
I'm gonna have to investigate
what's going on here,

94
00:04:18,107 --> 00:04:20,459
but it looks to me like
you just lost your job.

95
00:04:29,004 --> 00:04:30,510
So they're probably gonna fire me.

96
00:04:30,553 --> 00:04:32,672
Are you happy?
Oh, come on. They're not gonna--

97
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:34,808
I want your crap out of my
house by the end of the day.

98
00:04:37,251 --> 00:04:38,267
What the hell was that?

99
00:04:43,457 --> 00:04:45,721
A 757 went down in the sound.

100
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,769
We're looking at about
200 injured passengers.

101
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,432
We're the designated crisis center.

102
00:04:50,433 --> 00:04:52,264
Families will be instructed to come here

103
00:04:52,265 --> 00:04:53,461
to find their loved ones.

104
00:04:53,462 --> 00:04:55,612
We are activating surge protocol.

105
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:57,819
Dr. Hunt is gonna be running the show.

106
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,872
It's gonna be chaotic.
You need to listen carefully.

107
00:05:00,873 --> 00:05:03,929
You need to stay focused.
Do not contribute to the panic.

108
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:06,352
Now get to your stations.

109
00:05:07,521 --> 00:05:09,244
Dr. Bailey, let's clear
any beds that we can.

110
00:05:09,245 --> 00:05:11,453
Discharge or transfer. 
Okay, uh, Grey.

111
00:05:12,409 --> 00:05:14,736
All right, Torres, you'll be with me.

112
00:05:14,745 --> 00:05:16,669
Kepner, set up the E.R. for triage.

113
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,324
Other Grey, I want you
running the family center.

114
00:05:18,325 --> 00:05:20,452
Take over in the cafeteria.
Yang, blood bank.

115
00:05:20,461 --> 00:05:23,202
Uh, we might need a Candyman.
Dr. Sloan will be our Candyman.

116
00:05:23,203 --> 00:05:25,207
Let's be liberal with
pain meds for our victims

117
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,704
and sedatives for patients
that we are moving.

118
00:05:27,705 --> 00:05:30,391
Uh, Avery, you can help him out.
Let's move, people.

119
00:05:30,552 --> 00:05:33,106
What happened with Meredith?
Cristina, I can't--

120
00:05:33,107 --> 00:05:36,834
Owen. She tampered with Shepherd's study.

121
00:05:37,257 --> 00:05:39,520
Invalidated the results.
She destroyed the whole thing.

122
00:05:45,968 --> 00:05:48,450
There was a plane crash.
They're gonna cancel your procedure

123
00:05:48,451 --> 00:05:49,494
and try to send you home.

124
00:05:49,495 --> 00:05:51,121
You need to tell them that you are a D-1.

125
00:05:51,122 --> 00:05:52,195
You don't need to be in pre-op,

126
00:05:52,239 --> 00:05:54,390
but that you want to be
moved to a regular room.

127
00:05:54,447 --> 00:05:56,671
That way, when the hospital
starts doing surgery again,

128
00:05:57,537 --> 00:05:59,593
you'll be first in the queue.
Don't you have a plane--

129
00:06:00,504 --> 00:06:02,062
Wait. Did they shut down the airport?

130
00:06:02,063 --> 00:06:04,504
No, but we're not leaving till it's over.

131
00:06:04,618 --> 00:06:06,601
They need surgeons and trauma counselors.

132
00:06:08,032 --> 00:06:09,669
These are your films.
They're gonna schedule

133
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,372
your surgery at Seattle Presbyterian.

134
00:06:11,373 --> 00:06:14,243
Seattle Pres can't take anymore.
Start calling County. Avery!

135
00:06:15,486 --> 00:06:17,778
Why'd you give me that guy in
the middle of a mass trauma?

136
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:21,024
Avery? The kid quit Webber's study.
What kind of idiot decides

137
00:06:21,025 --> 00:06:22,114
working with the chief of surgery

138
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,775
is too taxing on his schedule?

139
00:06:23,776 --> 00:06:25,817
He didn't quit because he
thinks it's too much hard work.

140
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:29,092
He quit because he thinks the chief
has a shot at a Harper Avery,

141
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:31,058
and he was worried that
if his name was on it,

142
00:06:31,464 --> 00:06:33,071
it would kill Webber's chances.

143
00:06:35,034 --> 00:06:37,152
Kepner, discharges. 
Yeah.

144
00:06:44,144 --> 00:06:45,721
You know, she's the only one

145
00:06:45,722 --> 00:06:47,034
who ever gave a rat's ass about you,

146
00:06:47,035 --> 00:06:48,859
and now you might have
destroyed her career.

147
00:06:49,912 --> 00:06:51,858
You should find some
skanky intern to love you,

148
00:06:51,859 --> 00:06:53,374
'cause next time you're
in a burning building,

149
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,279
no one is handing you a glass of water.

150
00:06:56,818 --> 00:06:58,609
Please make sure you give
us a cell phone number--

151
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:01,831
Matthew Ruiz? Do you have--
No one from the flight has arrived yet.

152
00:07:01,832 --> 00:07:03,576
As soon as we get any infor--
Do you have a list of people

153
00:07:03,587 --> 00:07:05,567
they're bringing to the hospital?
Because we-- Folks,

154
00:07:05,568 --> 00:07:07,585
it can take emergency
services quite a long time

155
00:07:07,586 --> 00:07:09,970
to move and identify people
in a situation like this.

156
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,244
Please just try to be patient--
Excuse me.

157
00:07:11,245 --> 00:07:12,888
I'm sorry. Look, my wife was on the plane.

158
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:13,575
Can you please just tell me--
Sir,

159
00:07:13,576 --> 00:07:15,737
at this point, we don't
have any information.

160
00:07:15,817 --> 00:07:16,971
Please just sign the sheets.

161
00:07:16,972 --> 00:07:18,377
I'd like to speak to your supervisor.

162
00:07:18,475 --> 00:07:19,876
Somebody that knows what's going on.

163
00:07:19,877 --> 00:07:22,141
Ma'am, my supervisor doesn't
have any information.

164
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:25,847
Nobody has any information.
Please just sign the sheet.

165
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:31,907
Dr. Hunt, I had way too many
drinks before I told you that.

166
00:07:31,908 --> 00:07:33,919
I-I didn't mean for--
Not now, Karev.

167
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,093
Look, I told you that because

168
00:07:35,094 --> 00:07:36,501
I didn't think she should
be chief resident,

169
00:07:36,502 --> 00:07:38,778
not that she should be fired.
If you didn't think this through,

170
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:40,258
then you are as dumb as she is.

171
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:52,546
Hey.

172
00:07:53,486 --> 00:07:54,309
You okay?

173
00:07:54,543 --> 00:07:56,014
Yeah. I'm fine.

174
00:07:56,015 --> 00:08:00,857
Uh... the plane was from Baltimore,

175
00:08:00,858 --> 00:08:02,355
where my parents live.

176
00:08:03,325 --> 00:08:06,900
I've taken that flight, um... with my son.

177
00:08:09,577 --> 00:08:11,184
You want to come sit down
with me for a minute?

178
00:08:13,122 --> 00:08:15,458
No, no, no. I can't, uh...

179
00:08:16,251 --> 00:08:17,506
There's too much, uh...

180
00:08:17,925 --> 00:08:18,829
Okay. Um...

181
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:21,964
I'm just gonna--

182
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:23,932
I'm just gonna stand here for a minute.

183
00:08:25,094 --> 00:08:26,077
Is that all right?

184
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:35,956
Are you on any medications?
No.

185
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:38,175
Ever given blood before?

186
00:08:38,415 --> 00:08:39,102
Nope.

187
00:08:39,103 --> 00:08:40,147
Any chance you're pregnant?

188
00:08:40,148 --> 00:08:43,409
Mm... I don't know.

189
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:45,075
When was your last period? 
Not sure.

190
00:08:47,147 --> 00:08:48,843
Uh, what were you doing,

191
00:08:49,575 --> 00:08:51,263
um, last time you had to deal with tampons?

192
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:55,795
Like maybe it was St. Patrick's Day,

193
00:08:55,796 --> 00:08:58,392
and you ate, uh, four green doughnuts

194
00:08:58,393 --> 00:08:59,834
and thought, wow, that's disgusting.

195
00:08:59,835 --> 00:09:02,021
I must be hormonal. 
Oh, my gosh!

196
00:09:02,022 --> 00:09:04,707
You're right!
Except it was these gross cookies

197
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,108
with green frosting.

198
00:09:06,151 --> 00:09:07,519
But that was a while ago.

199
00:09:07,817 --> 00:09:11,098
Uh, I guess I had mine
again around Easter...

200
00:09:11,099 --> 00:09:13,459
'Cause I was all over
the marshmallow peeps.

201
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,863
It totally works.

202
00:09:17,953 --> 00:09:20,280
Hey. W-what the hell?

203
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,726
It looks about 6 weeks to me.

204
00:09:28,596 --> 00:09:30,406
I take it this wasn't deliberate.

205
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:33,973
No.

206
00:09:34,485 --> 00:09:35,412
Okay.

207
00:09:36,483 --> 00:09:38,387
You want to talk about options?

208
00:09:39,851 --> 00:09:40,603
No.

209
00:09:43,353 --> 00:09:45,609
Officials say it's too early

210
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:48,357
to speculate on the cause of the crash.

211
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:50,266
But here's what we do know--

212
00:09:50,267 --> 00:09:52,852
The flight originated
this morning in Baltimore

213
00:09:52,853 --> 00:09:57,067
carrying 183 passengers
and 18 crew members...

214
00:09:57,068 --> 00:09:59,913
Still nobody?
Oh, their families are going crazy.

215
00:09:59,914 --> 00:10:01,319
What is taking so long?

216
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,560
Well, fishing 200 people out
of the water is slow business.

217
00:10:04,613 --> 00:10:06,309
You want to play "Angry Birds"?

218
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:07,774
They'll do triage at the waterfront.

219
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:10,664
It takes time.
Actually, if they're taking this long,

220
00:10:10,665 --> 00:10:12,680
there's gonna be a lot of hypothermia.
Kepner. Oh, yeah.

221
00:10:12,681 --> 00:10:15,616
- Warm blankets, heated lamps,
and heated I.V. fluids. - Got it.

222
00:10:15,617 --> 00:10:18,058
You post chief resident yet?
Uh, no. Not yet.

223
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:19,275
What's the holdup?

224
00:10:20,035 --> 00:10:22,713
The suspense ain't killing me.
It's gonna be Grey.

225
00:10:22,714 --> 00:10:25,096
Well, I thought Karev
made a great play for it.

226
00:10:25,097 --> 00:10:26,059
A plane full of orphans--

227
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,346
That's pretty impressive.
Ah, he's already decided.

228
00:10:28,347 --> 00:10:31,187
You don't have to lobby for your boy.
Karev.

229
00:10:31,724 --> 00:10:33,932
I want a written account
of exactly what you saw,

230
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,084
every detail--when, where--
Oh,

231
00:10:35,085 --> 00:10:36,379
look, sir, I-I don't think that's--

232
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,318
I-I don't want to know what you think.
Okay?

233
00:10:39,632 --> 00:10:40,895
Need more sedatives.

234
00:10:40,896 --> 00:10:43,201
The people we're transferring
are starting to freak out.

235
00:10:43,367 --> 00:10:46,111
♪ When I was lost and looking down ♪

236
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:51,436

239

Take her. Take care of her.

241
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:03,834
I'll stay out of your way.

242
00:11:03,838 --> 00:11:05,734
I kind of already have her, but...

243
00:11:08,006 --> 00:11:08,717
Thank you?

244
00:11:08,718 --> 00:11:09,782
You're welcome.

245
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,082
I need to talk to you.

246
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:20,312
You know, I think I'm gonna order pizza.

247
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:21,127
If you want, I can get--

248
00:11:21,128 --> 00:11:22,344
I'm pregnant.

249
00:11:29,652 --> 00:11:30,085
Cristina--

250
00:11:30,086 --> 00:11:31,893
I cannot believe this is happening.

251
00:11:32,882 --> 00:11:36,761
I know. I know it's complicated.

252
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:40,039
I know it wasn't supposed
to happen like this, but...

253
00:11:41,738 --> 00:11:43,179
Cristina, this could be something--

254
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,636
What?
No.

255
00:11:46,302 --> 00:11:49,045
There's no way we're doing this.
Do you hear me? Cristina--

256
00:11:49,046 --> 00:11:52,490
No, no. I-I am not this
uh, uh, beautiful vessel

257
00:11:52,491 --> 00:11:55,079
for all that might be
good about the future.

258
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,400
I'm not carrying your hopes and dreams.
No. I get to talk.

259
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:01,236
I'm here. There's two of us.
We are a partnership.

260
00:12:01,237 --> 00:12:04,724
Can we just--just think together?
Is that okay?

261
00:12:10,681 --> 00:12:12,440
I know who you are. I know what you want.

262
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:13,513
I love you.

263
00:12:13,518 --> 00:12:16,696
I don't love the incubating
potential of your womb.

264
00:12:16,867 --> 00:12:17,795
I love you.

265
00:12:19,401 --> 00:12:20,876
Why would I want to do something

266
00:12:20,877 --> 00:12:22,035
that would make you miserable?

267
00:12:22,036 --> 00:12:23,814
Do you think I love you
more when you're miserable?

268
00:12:23,815 --> 00:12:27,249
Do you think I-I-I want that,
you running off to Meredith?

269
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,486
You think I'm looking for more of that?

270
00:12:31,176 --> 00:12:33,702
But... I think there's a way--

271
00:12:33,703 --> 00:12:35,909
No, no! I-I still get to talk.

272
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,226
There is a way to make this work

273
00:12:37,227 --> 00:12:40,402
without it ruining your life
or derailing your career.

274
00:12:41,592 --> 00:12:42,815
I don't want a baby.

275
00:12:43,602 --> 00:12:45,635
Well, you have one.

276
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,917
Are...

277
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:50,564
Are you getting all life-y on me?

278
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,374
How late are you?

279
00:12:53,999 --> 00:12:54,899
That does not matter.

280
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,043
Of course it matters.

281
00:12:57,665 --> 00:12:59,519
Okay, fine. You tell me when life begins.

282
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,830
You know, I can't--I can't
wait to hear this one.

283
00:13:00,831 --> 00:13:03,432
I don't know. Does it-- does it have hands?

284
00:13:04,967 --> 00:13:06,884
I cannot believe you are doing this.

285
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,427
I'm just asking a question.

286
00:13:08,985 --> 00:13:11,488
I don't want one.

287
00:13:13,011 --> 00:13:15,507
I don't hate children. I respect children.

288
00:13:15,971 --> 00:13:18,254
I think they should have
parents who want them.

289
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:19,216
I want them.

290
00:13:21,136 --> 00:13:22,790
I want them, and maybe you could to.

291
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:25,014
I believe...

292
00:13:25,822 --> 00:13:27,580
Your life can be bigger
than you think it is.

293
00:13:27,581 --> 00:13:30,964
I know you can contain more
than you think you can.

294
00:13:30,965 --> 00:13:34,813
I'm not saying we do this.
I am just saying, let's think.

295
00:13:34,979 --> 00:13:37,288
Let's see what kind of life we can imagine.

296
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,320
Cristina Yang...

297
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,105
I imagine such a huge life for us.

298
00:13:53,534 --> 00:13:56,005
This is an extremely serious
accusation, Meredith.

299
00:13:56,304 --> 00:13:57,141
Can't you tell me anything?

300
00:13:57,142 --> 00:13:58,951
I-I-I-I can't. I-I'm sorry.

301
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,052
Talk to me.

302
00:14:02,703 --> 00:14:04,935
How many patients are
we talking about here?

303
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:06,540
Did this happen more than once?

304
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,488
I can't say that either.

305
00:14:08,489 --> 00:14:09,726
She can't say anything.

306
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,035
We're gonna unwind this, Meredith.

307
00:14:12,254 --> 00:14:15,575
Karev is figuring out what cases
he was on when he saw you,

308
00:14:15,576 --> 00:14:17,922
he'll narrow down the dates,
we'll know which patients--

309
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:20,917
Nothing I did changed the trial.

310
00:14:20,918 --> 00:14:22,467
Uh, fire me. Do whatever you have to do.

311
00:14:22,468 --> 00:14:24,436
Look, you don't get to choose, okay?

312
00:14:27,913 --> 00:14:31,521
You don't get to decide who
gets the drug or the placebo.

313
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:34,384
You don't get to decide what
information the trial gets.

314
00:14:34,652 --> 00:14:38,171
Anything I tell you affects the trial.

315
00:14:38,225 --> 00:14:41,043
If you don't know what I did,
the trial stays blind.

316
00:14:41,044 --> 00:14:43,480
The trial is over. You screwed me.

317
00:14:43,661 --> 00:14:46,046
You screwed this hospital.
And you screwed yourself.

318
00:14:46,593 --> 00:14:48,491
This is your disease we're trying to cure.

319
00:14:48,829 --> 00:14:52,160
Or Lou Gehrig's disease,
but I did this for you.

320
00:14:52,161 --> 00:14:55,008
Derek, it was Adele.

321
00:15:06,691 --> 00:15:10,483
- Uh, maybe I should put some I.V. fluids
in the heater warm them up? - No.

322
00:15:10,588 --> 00:15:13,495
But if people have been in the
water for that long-- April--

323
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,525
But if we just--
No one's coming.

324
00:15:17,575 --> 00:15:21,206
If it's taking this long, nobody survived.

325
00:15:30,865 --> 00:15:31,959
What are you gonna do?

326
00:15:34,318 --> 00:15:35,113
I don't know.

327
00:15:35,114 --> 00:15:36,666
Well, the protocol is fairly clear.

328
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:38,964
Are you encouraging him to fire me?

329
00:15:39,091 --> 00:15:42,119
- Look, Derek, I basically
pressured her to do it. - Mm.

330
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,550
You'd have to fire us both.

331
00:15:52,612 --> 00:15:54,067
I'm gonna have to suspend you

332
00:15:54,239 --> 00:15:55,752
so it doesn't look so bad.

333
00:15:56,585 --> 00:15:57,456
The study...

334
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:00,669
I need to turn the whole
mess over to the F.D.A.,

335
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,119
let them figure out what to do with it.

336
00:16:02,163 --> 00:16:03,964
I mean, I-I can't. I just--

337
00:16:12,575 --> 00:16:13,470
Meredith...

338
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:14,990
I don't know how to...

339
00:16:14,991 --> 00:16:16,176
I know.

340
00:16:24,357 --> 00:16:27,478
Emergency services has
begun identifying bodies.

341
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,958
They've given us a list.

342
00:16:29,634 --> 00:16:31,171
The airline reps are on their way.

343
00:16:31,172 --> 00:16:33,524
We've got social workers
here and more coming.

344
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:37,152
It's a long list.
Each of you have families to inform.

345
00:16:37,318 --> 00:16:41,360
So, uh, please be outside the
cafeteria in exactly one hour.

346
00:16:41,711 --> 00:16:43,503
You'll call one family at a time.

347
00:16:43,617 --> 00:16:44,479
And you'll be assigned a room

348
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,815
to take them to and deliver the news.

349
00:16:47,184 --> 00:16:49,023
It's gonna be a-a long day.

350
00:16:50,002 --> 00:16:50,914
That's it.

351
00:17:11,022 --> 00:17:13,788
Dr. Hunt, you gave chief
resident to Kepner?

352
00:17:13,903 --> 00:17:15,567
It was supposed to be me or Grey.

353
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,794
Do you think anyone's
gonna listen to Kepner?

354
00:17:16,795 --> 00:17:17,915
It's gonna be complete chaos.

355
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,130
You think anyone's gonna listen to you?

356
00:17:19,145 --> 00:17:21,628
You just sold out the one
universally liked individual

357
00:17:21,629 --> 00:17:23,570
at this hospital.
Everyone is gonna hate you.

358
00:17:23,571 --> 00:17:25,539
A chief resident's supposed
to manage their peers,

359
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,992
be a resource and a support.
After what you did,

360
00:17:27,993 --> 00:17:30,232
do you think anyone is gonna
come to you for anything?

361
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,218
I was planning to give it to you.

362
00:17:34,157 --> 00:17:35,159
And now?

363
00:17:37,912 --> 00:17:39,567
So it's possible that we'll never...

364
00:17:39,939 --> 00:17:41,234
That we just...

365
00:17:42,426 --> 00:17:44,089
We just won't get the treatment?

366
00:17:44,205 --> 00:17:45,546
It's a possibility, yes.

367
00:17:45,547 --> 00:17:48,495
Oh, my God. This isn't right.

368
00:17:48,496 --> 00:17:49,823
We're so close.

369
00:17:49,824 --> 00:17:53,067
He needs this. Can you just...
Is it killing people?

370
00:17:53,068 --> 00:17:55,661
No. 
So give it to him anyway.

371
00:17:55,665 --> 00:17:58,758
I wish we could. 
No. Don't give me that.

372
00:17:58,986 --> 00:18:01,113
You can and you're choosing not to.
Audrey--

373
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:03,674
No. They say there's nothing they can do.

374
00:18:03,784 --> 00:18:06,720
There's a drug in a box in this hospital,

375
00:18:06,771 --> 00:18:08,307
and you were on the schedule.

376
00:18:08,552 --> 00:18:11,154
My children's father is disappearing.

377
00:18:11,155 --> 00:18:13,114
Give him the damn drug!

378
00:18:18,876 --> 00:18:21,988
I could take a leave for
six months or a year.

379
00:18:21,989 --> 00:18:22,650
No, you couldn't.

380
00:18:22,651 --> 00:18:25,445
Yes, I--Sure, I could.
They're not gonna fire me. No.

381
00:18:25,782 --> 00:18:28,866
Stop saying no.
I'm telling you, I want this.

382
00:18:28,867 --> 00:18:29,652
I can do this.

383
00:18:29,653 --> 00:18:32,509
This does not have to be your problem.

384
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,423
It'll be my problem. You wouldn't even--

385
00:18:34,424 --> 00:18:38,149
What, notice?
It'll be a baby.

386
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:41,207
I'm not a monster.
If I have a baby, I'll--I'll love it.

387
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,778
That's the problem.

388
00:18:45,681 --> 00:18:46,785
That you'll love it.

389
00:18:47,244 --> 00:18:49,757
That--that's a problem
that we can work with.

390
00:18:49,789 --> 00:18:51,145
I'm sorry. Are you laughing right now?

391
00:18:51,146 --> 00:18:53,489
No, no. I'm just--I'm not-- I just...

392
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:55,811
I love you.

393
00:18:56,489 --> 00:18:58,538
What is so--
Are you even listening to me?

394
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:00,942
Yes. I'm just trying to figure out

395
00:19:00,943 --> 00:19:02,013
some kind of a compromise.

396
00:19:02,014 --> 00:19:04,686
Okay, but you know what?
There is no compromise.

397
00:19:04,807 --> 00:19:06,663
You don't have half a baby.

398
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:08,455
I don't want one.

399
00:19:09,202 --> 00:19:11,158
Okay, I-it isn't about work.

400
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:12,528
This isn't a scheduling conflict.

401
00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:14,177
I don't want to be a mother.

402
00:19:14,676 --> 00:19:15,972
Cristina, do you love me?

403
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,714
Of course I do.

404
00:19:17,715 --> 00:19:18,583
Do you trust me?

405
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:22,206
I... y-yes.

406
00:19:22,207 --> 00:19:24,154
You'd be a great mother. You would.

407
00:19:24,155 --> 00:19:27,090
I-I know you don't believe
me, but it is true.

408
00:19:27,091 --> 00:19:30,062
Just sit with this for a little while,

409
00:19:30,118 --> 00:19:33,422
this terrible idea that
you might love a baby.

410
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:34,947
Just for me, sit with it--

411
00:19:34,948 --> 00:19:37,649
Did you even hear--
I mean, okay. Why would I do that?

412
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:40,323
Because you love me. You love me.

413
00:19:41,449 --> 00:19:43,082
That's why.

414
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,473
I have three names.

415
00:19:47,874 --> 00:19:49,834
I don't think I can do this three times.

416
00:19:50,741 --> 00:19:52,301
One foot in front of the other.

417
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:53,945
Oh, I've got something
that'll cheer you up.

418
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,274
Sloan gave us his blessing.

419
00:19:56,275 --> 00:19:57,038
Well, that's not really right.

420
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,425
More like he gave you
to me, which was nice.

421
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:03,900
Are you serious?

422
00:20:03,901 --> 00:20:07,300
Yep. Though I probably owe him a goat.

423
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,030
Okay.

424
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:12,810
All right. Let's do it.

425
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:26,280
Is the Schoman family here--
Jessica and Maxwell?

426
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,860
Jason Schoman. He's our son.

427
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,440
I'm Dr. Altman. Will you follow me, please?

428
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,730
They think it's good news.

429
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,800
Elaine Chen.

430
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,760
Ma'am, I'm Dr. Sloan.
Why don't you come with me?

431
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:42,360
Uh, Gilda and Miguel Ruiz?

432
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:44,200
This is a nightmare.

433
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:48,060
Hi, I'm Dr. Bailey. Come with me, please.

434
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,020
I brought some pudding.

435
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,330
That's why you're here?

436
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,440
I've got a good nurse.
She'll hook me up with pudding.

437
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,940
I know. It's just...

438
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,380
Oh, I just spent the last two hours

439
00:21:14,381 --> 00:21:15,890
telling people that their
family members were dead,

440
00:21:15,891 --> 00:21:18,430
and I needed to--
Well, I just wanted to say hi...

441
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,580
Or bye again.

442
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,430
I don't know. I--

443
00:21:22,431 --> 00:21:24,170
I really tried to be a
gentleman about all this.

444
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:28,759
But now you need to get the hell out.
What are you doing?

445
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,070
Letting you go was the worst
thing I've ever done.

446
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,490
It was the most painful thing
I've ever done, and I'm a guy

447
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,380
who has had 82 surgeries.

448
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,690
My threshold for pain is pretty high.

449
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,150
You need to get out.

450
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,740
I'm not your best bud.
I'm not your security blanket.

451
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:47,020
I'm a man who's in love with you,

452
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:49,570
who waltzed you into the arms
of a damn knight on a horse.

453
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,880
So go to Germany

454
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,920
and have little spaetzle-eating children.

455
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,540
And please, for God sakes,

456
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,430
leave me alone.

457
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:12,350
The cafeteria is pandemonium.

458
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,100
There.

459
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,760
Are you admitting anyone?

460
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:19,460
No, we're signing in a few so
we can give 'em sedatives.

461
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,170
That's about it.

462
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:27,590
E.R.

463
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,840
There's a survivor.

464
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,939
Are you leaving? 
No, I didn't get fired.

465
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,330
I know that's disappointing to you.

466
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,629
My trial is about to disappear.

467
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:41,340
You really want to act
like I'm the bad guy here?

468
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,740
No, I don't. I know the fact

469
00:22:42,741 --> 00:22:45,079
that it is Adele changes
things for Richard,

470
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,050
but it doesn't for me.
Oh, I understand that.

471
00:22:47,051 --> 00:22:48,610
You couldn't possibly understand that.

472
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,539
If you were focused on
the millions of people

473
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,390
with Alzheimer's whose lives
could've been different,

474
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,690
would've been better because of this drug,

475
00:22:54,691 --> 00:22:56,250
there's no way in hell you
would've pulled this stunt.

476
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:01,260
How is it that you don't
know the difference

477
00:23:01,261 --> 00:23:03,350
between right and wrong?

478
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:04,939
Because I don't think

479
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,120
that things are simply right or wrong.

480
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:09,430
Things are more complicated than that.

481
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:11,080
This was more complicated than that.

482
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:14,510
It's complicated that it
was Adele and Richard.

483
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:18,120
It's complicated that
we have a drug in a box

484
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,280
that could help her.

485
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,550
There's nothing simple about that.

486
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:26,880
I am very sorry that I
messed everything up.

487
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:28,180
But I would do it again.

488
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:32,070
I don't know how to raise a child

489
00:23:32,071 --> 00:23:33,830
with someone who doesn't understand that

490
00:23:33,831 --> 00:23:37,290
there's a...
a right and a wrong in the world.

491
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,640
So now I'm gonna be a bad mother.

492
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:45,320
That's where we're going with this?

493
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,510
You've been saying it for weeks.

494
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:49,990
Maybe you're right.

495
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:55,880
Okay.

496
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:57,760
Maybe you're right.

497
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,130
I just need some time to think.

498
00:24:00,131 --> 00:24:00,930
I just...

499
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,340
I just need some space.

500
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,750
***

501
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:11,009
Sarah Gordon--G.C.S. of 6, head injury

502
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,510
and multiple contusions to mid-torso.

503
00:24:12,511 --> 00:24:15,649
Systolic 70s in the field.
Unaccompanied minor?

504
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:17,710
Yeah, she was flying alone. 
On my count.

505
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,159
One, two, three.
Okay, I need X-ray in here.

506
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,250
We need to shoot a C-spine, chest, and pelvis.
Abdomen's rigid.

507
00:24:23,251 --> 00:24:24,030
I've got the ultrasound.

508
00:24:24,031 --> 00:24:25,370
Large hematoma on the left temporal lobe.

509
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:27,690
Breath sounds are equal.
Folks, we've got eyes.

510
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,830
Let me get in there.
Sarah, I'm Dr. Shepherd.

511
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,350
You see all these people around you?

512
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,650
They're doctors.

513
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,800
You ever seen this many doctors before?

514
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,360
Hey, don't worry.
We're all here to take care of you, okay?

515
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:41,400
Hey, honey.

516
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:43,860
They found his body.

517
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,910
Because his wallet was still in his pocket.

518
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,540
They said because the impact.

519
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,200
I don't know.

520
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,500
Maybe it was fast.

521
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:01,280
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

522
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,230
There's no battery.

523
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,250
I'm pushing the button.
I don't hear anything.

524
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:08,849
Honey, let me try, okay?

525
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:10,960
The battery is dead.
What are you gonna try?

526
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,280
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

527
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,680
Ma'am. Can I help you?

528
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:17,370
We have to call someone...

529
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,590
But the cell phone's not working.

530
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:22,100
Okay, well, we have phones
that you can use. Uh, Jenny.

531
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,130
I'll do it. I'll do it.

532
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,950
Why don't you take a seat?

533
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:37,150
Excuse me. Is the Gordon family here?

534
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,930
The Gordons?

535
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:46,890
They found somebody?

536
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,960
A little girl. Unaccompanied minor.

537
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:50,600
They're operating on her right now.

538
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:53,560
Thank you. Yeah.

539
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,050
We should go home, honey.

540
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,960
A little girl made it. She's alive.

541
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:01,710
I think we should stay.

542
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:04,830
She doesn't have anyone.
Her parents aren't here yet.

543
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:06,500
I think we should stay. 
Gilda--

544
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,770
If Matthew had been...

545
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:16,810
I would like... to stay.

546
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,000
Okay.

547
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:28,560
Okay.

548
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:30,540
We'll stay.

549
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:40,060
I'll, uh...

550
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,580
I will let you know how she's doing.

551
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:48,940
Mer.

552
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:52,240
Oh, the adoption lady's paging me.
Derek's A.W.O.L.

553
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,330
He's not even speaking to me.

554
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,730
Wait a minute. Is it a true?
What--what were you thinking?

555
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:59,210
I was thinking that the chief's wife

556
00:26:59,211 --> 00:27:01,229
was about to have saline
injected in her brain

557
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,500
instead of a drug that could stop her

558
00:27:02,501 --> 00:27:05,670
from being a gorked-out lump.
Derek's head almost exploded.

559
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,580
Are they gonna fire you? 
I'm suspended.

560
00:27:07,581 --> 00:27:09,640
The chief backed way off when
he found out it was Adele.

561
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,729
I did what I had to do.
Meredith--

562
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,550
And I couldn't live with myself
if I'd done anything different.

563
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,880
And Karev is trying to ruin my life.

564
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,110
Mer.

565
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,310
What did you say to her?
I didn't say anything.

566
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,449
Janet, anything he says--
Can you just shut up for one second?

567
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:30,540
This isn't about that.

568
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:36,510
We're granting you
temporary custody of Zola,

569
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:39,139
pending the completion of the petition,

570
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,720
at which point, assuming all goes well,

571
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,420
you'll be granted permanent custody.

572
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,969
And her doctor here says she's doing great,

573
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:47,850
so you can take her home...

574
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,760
Today.

575
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:53,719
Her incisions look fine.
She's tolerating a normal diet.

576
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,530
She'll need neuro follow-ups.
She's still on antibiotics.

577
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:00,560
Uh, here's a prescription for
any pain meds she might need,

578
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:02,230
but she's been fine the
last couple of days.

579
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,350
Do you have any questions about anything?

580
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,910
Meredith, do you have any questions?

581
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,180
Oh, hi. 
You done?

582
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,390
Uh, no, no.

583
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,850
I still have some more, uh, families.

584
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:29,090
Uh, sorry I paged you.
I just wanted to see your face.

585
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:31,010
I think, you know, something
like this happens,

586
00:28:31,011 --> 00:28:31,680
you just...

587
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,520
You want to be with someone that you love.

588
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,430
So we're booked 
on a 9:00 A.M. flight tomorrow.

589
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:44,540
Let's just spend the night
in some fancy hotel,

590
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,300
just never get out of the bath.

591
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:49,600
What? Are you okay?

592
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:56,190
Derek, I understand that you
don't want to talk to me,

593
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,910
but this is important.

594
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,660
I need to talk to you.

595
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:03,540
I'm your wife. You need to call me back.

596
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:12,700
Does anyone know where there's a nurse

597
00:29:12,701 --> 00:29:14,040
or an information person?

598
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,280
She should be right back.

599
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,440
My daughter was in the crash.

600
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:20,010
They said she had to have surgery.
Are we supposed to--

601
00:29:20,011 --> 00:29:22,799
You're Mrs. Gordon?
Yes. Sarah Gordon is my d--

602
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,130
They're still operating.

603
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,060
The doctors have been here every half-hour.

604
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:30,119
They'll be here any minute.
Say, would you like some coffee or--

605
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,610
I'll get it. I'll get it.

606
00:29:31,611 --> 00:29:33,970
Here, sit down.
You must have been driving like crazy.

607
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,410
I... I don't under-- 
Are you--

608
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:38,420
We heard she was alone.

609
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:41,990
I thought, as a parent, if
my child was here alone, I--

610
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,030
Well, we all thought that

611
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:46,280
she should have someone pulling for her.

612
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,010
Thank you.

613
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:50,920
That's incredible.

614
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,950
Diapers

615
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,650
and swaddle blankets...

616
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,860
And formula.

617
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,030
These little bottles are
good for the diaper bag.

618
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,390
You have a diaper bag?

619
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:11,190
- No. - Oh, we'll get you one.
We've got a few in the NICU closet.

620
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:12,970
You know, we have all this gear--

621
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:15,049
The parents come in, the
baby doesn't make it,

622
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:16,630
they--they don't want to see the stuff,

623
00:30:16,631 --> 00:30:18,010
so they just leave it behind.

624
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:23,570
Now here's the pacifiers.
She likes the green ones.

625
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,280
Is your husband putting
the car seat in the car?

626
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:28,910
Don't have a car seat.
Not even sure I have a husband.

627
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,320
Surgeons, right?

628
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:33,800
You probably forget what he
looks like without a mask.

629
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:34,800
We'll get you one.

630
00:30:34,801 --> 00:30:36,840
You're probably gonna
need a porta-crib, too.

631
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,200
I'm gonna throw in some more diaper cream.

632
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:41,870
She went with her dad to
visit her grandparents,

633
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:45,559
and he had to stay so he
put her on the plane,

634
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:49,000
and... there was a flight
attendant that watched her

635
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:50,260
and was supposed to walk her

636
00:30:50,261 --> 00:30:52,090
to her connecting flight in Vancouver.

637
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,470
We never imagined...

638
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,730
God, I'm sorry.

639
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:01,140
I never even asked.
You had someone on the plane.

640
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:06,520
My son--Matthew.

641
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,040
Oh, i-is he in surgery, too?

642
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,330
Yes.

643
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,800
Will he be okay?

644
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,070
Yes, he will.

645
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,900
Sarah's out of surgery.
You can come see her now.

646
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:53,260
Hey.

647
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,790
Can you stand up?

648
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,220
I thought I was pretty clear, Teddy.

649
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,430
Just shut up and stand up.
I-I have to do something,

650
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:32,910
and I can't do it while you're
lying in a hospital bed.

651
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,650
I don't want a good-bye hug.
It's gonna make you feel better.

652
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,230
It's not gonna make me feel a--
Can you just stand up?

653
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:05,870
You're my husband, and...

654
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:10,840
And I think I'm falling in love with you.

655
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:31,200
Hey, how you doing?

656
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,310
Ugh. Not now, Mark.

657
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:37,339
Oh, come on, Lexie.
You've been in the dead zone all day--

658
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,860
You have to stop.

659
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:42,120
You gotta stop talking
to me and checking on me

660
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:43,800
and talking to my boyfriend.

661
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:46,530
I love you,

662
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,190
and I am always gonna love you.

663
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:50,869
But I don't want to love you.

664
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:54,460
I want to be happy, and
Jackson makes me happy.

665
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:57,480
And if you keep pulling at me, I'm...

666
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:59,430
I'll come back to you.

667
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:02,600
You're right.

668
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:04,789
I'm sorry.

669
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:07,200
You got what you wanted.
You wanted a family.

670
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,249
So please just let me have what I want.

671
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,430
I said you were right.

672
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,290
I told Avery I was letting you go.

673
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:17,589
Did he tell you that part? 
Yeah. It's paternalistic and weird.

674
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:18,970
I'm letting you go, Lexie.

675
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,320
That means you gotta...

676
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:24,240
walk away.

677
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:37,240
Chief friggin' resident. Unbelievable.

678
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:38,620
I'm sorry.

679
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:41,020
What? Don't be. You deserve it.

680
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,650
I'm happy.

681
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,990
Hi. 
Can you take that for me? Thanks.

682
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:48,630
I have what I want.
It's been such a crappy year.

683
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:50,190
I can't believe we're both happy.

684
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,700
I can't believe they like me enough

685
00:34:51,701 --> 00:34:54,410
to make me chief resident.
They hated me for so long.

686
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,060
I can't believe I actually
have friends here.

687
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:58,240
Well, they're gonna hate you again.

688
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,930
It's now your job to boss them around.

689
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,890
You know how much they love that.

690
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,570
Oh, God. Is that true?

691
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:09,580
That's true.

692
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,330
Okay, so this is the house.

693
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,100
There's another house where
you're gonna have your own room,

694
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:23,869
but that, right now, is
just wood and no walls,

695
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:25,590
so we're gonna stay here for a while.

696
00:35:25,591 --> 00:35:26,140
Derek?

697
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:31,540
Okay. He might be A.W.O.L. 
He's had a bad day.

698
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:33,620
And he's a little...

699
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,110
pissed off right now.

700
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,590
But we're gonna be fine.

701
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:43,260
So we had a big plan if
this ever worked out.

702
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:46,149
We were gonna have a lullaby from Malawi

703
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,670
to make everything feel homey for you.

704
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:48,990
To be honest,

705
00:35:48,991 --> 00:35:51,280
right now, I can't even think
of an American lullaby.

706
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,000
Lexie.

707
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,530
You know, a lot of people live here.

708
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,030
It gets kind of crazy sometimes,

709
00:36:03,031 --> 00:36:04,860
and it's usually not this quiet.

710
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,340
Alex.

711
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:21,980
Okay.

712
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:24,940
We're gonna be okay.

713
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,790
You and I, we're a team, right?

714
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:30,570
We're tough. We have that in common.

715
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,820
I am very glad you're here.

716
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,920
I didn't think your first day
was gonna be quite like this.

717
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:41,320
But I am gonna get it together,

718
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,280
and we are gonna figure it out.

719
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:57,540
Tell me how much you love me.

720
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,010
I...

721
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,500
I love you a very great deal.

722
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:07,610
A lot?

723
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,610
You love me so much.

724
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:13,770
I want you to remember that.

725
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,770
I made an appointment to
terminate the pregnancy.

726
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,659
I'm sorry if this upsets you.

727
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,889
I'm sorry if this isn't what you wanted.

728
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:34,849
But... I cannot talk about it anymore.

729
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:37,650
I... need to lie down. I feel like crap.

730
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,450
This is a marriage.

731
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:41,750
I tied my life to you.

732
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,710
You don't decide this without me.

733
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:46,790
Do you see me standing here?
My head is killing me.

734
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:51,049
You give in a marriage.
You make sacrifices.

735
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:54,060
I've made many, and I am asking
you to do something for me.

736
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:57,810
Can you simply consider
doing something for me?

737
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,749
Have a baby?
This isn't pizza versus thai.

738
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,409
You don't give a little on a baby.
Cristina, I am asking you--

739
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:05,030
I am saying no!

740
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:24,970
Get out.

741
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:28,370
Are you--

742
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,759
Because I'm denying you
a baby, you're trying--

743
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,860
Because you denied me part of the decision,

744
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:36,099
because you denied me a marriage.

745
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,500
Oh, how dare you--
Get out!

746
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,690
Um, I'm gonna go.

747
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:51,100
I just wanted to s-say good night.

748
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:55,400
I want to come home with you.

749
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,650
Oh, no. I can't.
Um, Tuck's with me tonight.

750
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:00,650
I can meet your son.

751
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:02,530
I'm not gonna bite your son.

752
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:05,520
No, it's--it's just not the right time.

753
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:06,750
Uh-huh. I-I can't--

754
00:39:06,751 --> 00:39:09,080
This is a relationship.
Things today were bad.

755
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:11,560
We lean on each other when things are bad.

756
00:39:11,561 --> 00:39:13,130
That information's not
gonna hurt your child,

757
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,850
and if it does, then this is not
the right relationship for me.

758
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,869
Okay.

759
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:19,850
I can control myself in your house.

760
00:39:19,851 --> 00:39:21,350
I'm not gonna touch you. 
Okay.

761
00:39:21,351 --> 00:39:23,040
You just--you know, you could
tell him I'm your friend.

762
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:25,790
Tell him whatever you need to--
Okay.

763
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:58,270
Oh. I was hoping you were Derek.

764
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:01,040
Sorry. Well, he took off,

765
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,700
and the hospital gave me a baby.

766
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,670
She's upstairs sleeping in
some dead kid's porta-crib.

767
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:10,949
Uh, I'm getting an abortion...

768
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,110
And Owen just kicked me out of my house.

769
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,570
What? You're--
Pregnant.

770
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,590
And you're--
Getting an abortion.

771
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,410
Well... why didn't you tell me?

772
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:24,620
You had a busy, busy day.

773
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:27,090
There's a reason I said I'd be happy alone.

774
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:32,179
Come upstairs. I need help.

775
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,540
I... I can't.

776
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,500
I gotta lie down.

777
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:39,480
It wasn't 'cause I thought
I'd be happy alone.

778
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,880
It was because I thought
if I loved someone...

779
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,020
And then it fell apart...

780
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,680
I might not make it.

781
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:56,670
Tell me not to go to Africa.

782
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,410
Alex.

783
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:02,810
Go to hell.

784
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:08,820
It's easier to be alone.

785
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:14,150
Because what if you learn
that you need love...

786
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,720
And then you don't have it?

787
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:20,470
What if you like it

788
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:23,320
and lean on it?

789
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:28,610
What if you shape your life around it...

790
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,040
And then...

791
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:35,970
It falls apart?

792
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,260
Can you even survive that kind of pain?

793
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:45,840
Losing love is like organ damage.

794
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,600
It's like dying.

795
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:55,810
The only difference is...

796
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:59,450
Death ends.

797
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:02,880
This?

798
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:07,070
It could go on forever.
