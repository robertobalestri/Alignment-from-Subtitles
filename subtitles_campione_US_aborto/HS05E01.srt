1
00:00:04,742 --> 00:00:06,198
Who picked this dump?

2
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:07,868
You suggested it.

3
00:00:08,914 --> 00:00:10,467
I suggested you look into it.

4
00:00:10,587 --> 00:00:11,806
The online reviews...

5
00:00:11,966 --> 00:00:14,684
were obviously written by some geek
in their own marketing department.

6
00:00:15,001 --> 00:00:16,728
Next time, call someone you know.

7
00:00:16,888 --> 00:00:19,189
Stop relying on a computer
to do your job for you.

8
00:00:19,474 --> 00:00:22,135
Brightsize apparel, eight sexual
harassment suits in two years.

9
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:24,359
- Who asked for the meeting?
- They did.

10
00:00:28,867 --> 00:00:32,125
Patty Michener,
president of Women's Majority, and...

11
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:35,580
Do you guys need me!

12
00:00:37,152 --> 00:00:38,132
Nine men.

13
00:00:39,099 --> 00:00:41,419
No one thought it might be
a good idea to put a suit on

14
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,471
one of the gals from the steno pool
to make it look like you give a damn?

15
00:00:44,591 --> 00:00:46,925
We've made it a priority
to promote more women, but...

16
00:00:47,085 --> 00:00:49,732
Well, from now
on you have me standing beside you,

17
00:00:49,852 --> 00:00:50,950
which is good.

18
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,156
Because your problem
is a national problem.

19
00:00:53,276 --> 00:00:54,817
With all due respect, miss Michener,

20
00:00:54,937 --> 00:00:58,019
I'd hardly call a few isolated incidents
a national problem.

21
00:00:58,179 --> 00:01:01,022
Six out of ten victims
never even report harassment.

22
00:01:01,984 --> 00:01:03,900
This is bigger than just eight women.

23
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,319
- That still only means 20.
- Not enough for you?

24
00:01:07,202 --> 00:01:10,404
How many asses does your corporate
policy allow you to grab?

25
00:01:11,081 --> 00:01:12,617
Tell you what you're gonna do.

26
00:01:12,777 --> 00:01:15,302
You're gonna settle with anyone
you haven't settled with.

27
00:01:15,422 --> 00:01:17,670
You're gonna fire any man
who's even been accused.

28
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,583
Somebody help me!
Please help me. I can't get 'em off!

29
00:01:20,743 --> 00:01:21,960
Please help me!

30
00:01:22,755 --> 00:01:24,159
Help me, please!

31
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:26,214
Somebody help me!

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,133
Get 'em off.

33
00:01:28,293 --> 00:01:31,818
You gonna call an ambulance, or
are you just gonna sit there and stare?

34
00:01:31,938 --> 00:01:33,555
Help me, please!

35
00:01:40,763 --> 00:01:43,524
House - Season 05 Episode 01
"Dying Change Everything"

36
00:01:44,822 --> 00:01:47,577
Synchro: ShalimarFox, mpm, Icefreak

37
00:02:10,971 --> 00:02:14,673
www.house-fr.com

38
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,893
Wilson's back.

39
00:02:25,584 --> 00:02:28,008
- You gonna...
- He's been gone two months.

40
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:32,143
He can wait till I finish slaying a guy
in a skullcap and a pair of tights.

41
00:02:32,263 --> 00:02:34,240
On a video game you stole
from the pediatric ward?

42
00:02:34,556 --> 00:02:38,286
On advice of counsel, I assert
my privilege pursuant to the fifth.

43
00:02:45,407 --> 00:02:47,857
When was the last time
you talked to him?

44
00:02:47,977 --> 00:02:49,652
I think it was after...

45
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,794
When did his girlfriend die?

46
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,211
He wanted time alone.

47
00:02:55,588 --> 00:02:57,696
I considered being a horrendous
pain in the ass,

48
00:02:57,816 --> 00:02:59,802
but I didn't want to tread on your turf.

49
00:03:00,212 --> 00:03:01,351
We got a case.

50
00:03:01,867 --> 00:03:03,607
I've gotta remember to close the blinds.

51
00:03:03,727 --> 00:03:06,596
Just got a call from Patty Michener
From Women's Majority, the women's...

52
00:03:06,716 --> 00:03:08,855
- We know who she is.
- I dated her.

53
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,480
Well, not really dated her, more

54
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,030
metaphorically raped her
by having a penis.

55
00:03:14,285 --> 00:03:15,226
You did too.

56
00:03:15,346 --> 00:03:16,699
Her assistant flipped out.

57
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:19,410
Ripped off her clothes
in front of a room full of businessmen.

58
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,386
Well, either she cracked under the whip,

59
00:03:21,506 --> 00:03:25,282
or she started to realize that her
evolutionary purpose is to arouse men,

60
00:03:25,402 --> 00:03:27,958
not to castrate them.
Send her to psychiatric.

61
00:03:28,078 --> 00:03:32,247
Anemia, bradycardia, and abdominal pain
aren't psychiatric symptoms.

62
00:03:33,334 --> 00:03:35,986
Then it's the latter.
Send her to my apartment.

63
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:38,249
I'll give it to Segal.

64
00:03:38,369 --> 00:03:40,398
House actually wants a case,
and you're saying no?

65
00:03:40,518 --> 00:03:42,398
House has more important things to do.

66
00:03:43,233 --> 00:03:44,703
Sorry, can't help you.

67
00:03:45,448 --> 00:03:47,814
You need a specialist
to remove those kind of warts.

68
00:03:47,974 --> 00:03:50,233
Preferably one
with experience spelunking.

69
00:03:57,253 --> 00:03:59,739
Hallucinations, possible memory loss.

70
00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:02,078
Tests show anemia, slow heart rate,

71
00:04:02,198 --> 00:04:04,780
and a stubborn refusal
to shave her pits.

72
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:07,200
- Have you seen Wilson?
- Nope.

73
00:04:07,761 --> 00:04:10,265
But I have seen the patient's
frequent flyer balance.

74
00:04:10,385 --> 00:04:12,563
Eastern Europe,
Asia, Third-world countries.

75
00:04:12,915 --> 00:04:14,880
- Sometimes more than one a day.
- No fever means

76
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,308
it's not a tropical disease.

77
00:04:16,428 --> 00:04:18,780
If it's not where she went,
maybe it's the work hours.

78
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,725
Could be amphetamine abuse.
She's probably

79
00:04:20,845 --> 00:04:23,558
- popping them like breath mints.
- You haven't been by his office?

80
00:04:23,718 --> 00:04:26,436
Is Wilson hallucinating ants
crawling all over him too?

81
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:31,025
Tox screen's cleaner than
the windows she won't do.

82
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:33,853
Her job keeps her constantly
on the road, probably living off

83
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:36,225
of airline peanuts and diet soda.

84
00:04:36,345 --> 00:04:38,714
Severe B12 deficiency
could cause all her symptoms.

85
00:04:38,834 --> 00:04:40,651
Why is everyone leaping to conclude

86
00:04:40,771 --> 00:04:43,632
a strong career woman's been made sick
by her strong career?

87
00:04:43,752 --> 00:04:45,788
It's not B12,
she has an insulanoma in her pancreas.

88
00:04:45,948 --> 00:04:47,490
It's making her hypoglycemic.

89
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,080
Great.

90
00:04:49,494 --> 00:04:50,919
Now everyone knows.

91
00:04:52,431 --> 00:04:53,922
You knew the patient had cancer?

92
00:04:54,082 --> 00:04:55,579
Is that what she said?

93
00:04:56,168 --> 00:04:57,558
I thought she said,

94
00:04:57,678 --> 00:04:59,469
"I am suddenly
and irrationally defending

95
00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:01,683
"the patient's strong career,
"even though in reality

96
00:05:01,803 --> 00:05:03,473
"she's just a glorified grunt?

97
00:05:03,633 --> 00:05:05,350
"I'm trying to convince my that it's OK

98
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,563
"not to have a life`cause
i don't have a life. `Cause

99
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:10,841
" I was tested for Huntington's,
and my life span's been cut in half."

100
00:05:13,806 --> 00:05:15,760
Been waiting two months
for her to say that.

101
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,559
Hallucinations, anemia, bradycardia,

102
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:19,760
Hyper segmented polys
says that Taub's right.

103
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,157
Pump her full of B12.

104
00:05:21,317 --> 00:05:24,911
See how a strong career woman's
been made sick by her strong career.

105
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,764
Are you okay?

106
00:05:37,884 --> 00:05:39,855
Could be years before
you see any symptoms.

107
00:05:39,975 --> 00:05:42,689
- Why wouldn't you tell us?
- I don't have Huntington's.

108
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,275
Are you lying to us...

109
00:05:44,395 --> 00:05:46,148
Because it's none of our business?

110
00:05:46,268 --> 00:05:48,518
Yes, then I shouldn't have
to answer these questions.

111
00:05:48,638 --> 00:05:51,527
I wouldn't have to, except House doesn't
want to answer questions about Wilson.

112
00:05:51,647 --> 00:05:53,645
He's deflecting
his own problems onto me.

113
00:05:53,765 --> 00:05:55,335
Are you deflecting now?

114
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:58,961
Time for a B12 cocktail
and my life lesson.

115
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:06,577
No, Patty will do the hearing. She just
needs to be the leadoff witness so...

116
00:06:07,442 --> 00:06:09,561
Okay, I'll lock it down today.

117
00:06:11,403 --> 00:06:14,913
- I need you back in bed.
- My boss has a big Beijing trip.

118
00:06:15,033 --> 00:06:17,846
I've been planning it for months.
I was just tired and dehydrated and

119
00:06:17,966 --> 00:06:20,110
Yeah, whenever I lose
some shut-eye, I pound my legs,

120
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,282
clawing at imaginary ant colonies.

121
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,847
You have a severe B12 deficiency.
Get back in bed.

122
00:06:41,397 --> 00:06:43,463
I'm sure your boss
can do without you for a few days.

123
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:44,846
It's not about her.

124
00:06:44,966 --> 00:06:46,211
It's about me.

125
00:06:46,331 --> 00:06:47,760
I want to be there.

126
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,681
- I want to matter.
- Yeah, without you,

127
00:06:49,801 --> 00:06:52,252
who knows how much starch
they'd put in her shirts?

128
00:06:54,136 --> 00:06:56,032
I'm sorry, I'm sure
your boss depends on you...

129
00:06:56,152 --> 00:06:58,125
- I need to get up.
- No, you need to stay in bed.

130
00:06:58,245 --> 00:07:01,396
Please, where's a bed pan?
Oh, my god, I'm sorry. I just,

131
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,465
I just had a bowel movement.

132
00:07:04,585 --> 00:07:07,272
It's okay,
B12 deficiency can cause sudden...

133
00:07:10,239 --> 00:07:12,160
That's not a bowel movement.

134
00:07:17,524 --> 00:07:18,608
My patient...

135
00:07:18,768 --> 00:07:22,195
Is still fighting in the feminist
trenches, but the war is over.

136
00:07:22,355 --> 00:07:25,279
Yesterday's sluts
are today's empowered women.

137
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:27,255
Today's sluts are celebrities.

138
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:28,646
If that isn't progress...

139
00:07:28,766 --> 00:07:29,970
I'm leaving.

140
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:33,911
What, are you gonna take
another two months?

141
00:07:34,157 --> 00:07:36,951
Boy, you're really milking
this bereavement thing, aren't you?

142
00:07:39,071 --> 00:07:41,599
I mean, good for you.
Take all the time you need.

143
00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:42,757
I'm resigning.

144
00:07:43,973 --> 00:07:46,385
Maybe moving out of New Jersey.
I don't know yet.

145
00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:47,497
Okay.

146
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,320
That's an understandable reaction.

147
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,221
It's not a reaction.
It's a decision.

148
00:07:52,459 --> 00:07:54,471
I'm writing Cuddy
my resignation right now.

149
00:07:54,591 --> 00:07:58,007
I'm just back for the week to wrap up
my clinical and administrative duties.

150
00:07:59,014 --> 00:08:02,193
You of all people should know,
this is bereavement 101.

151
00:08:02,974 --> 00:08:04,555
You think that a change of venue...

152
00:08:04,675 --> 00:08:07,161
Well, that spares me
decades of psychoanalysis.

153
00:08:07,388 --> 00:08:10,910
- I'm not saying you're not in pain.
- You're saying my pain's a cliche.

154
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:13,371
- I'm saying that pain fades.
- Did yours?

155
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:15,623
Physical pain is different.

156
00:08:15,783 --> 00:08:17,625
I'd rather have my leg chopped off.

157
00:08:17,785 --> 00:08:20,290
- You don't know that, you haven't felt
- Neither have you.

158
00:08:22,754 --> 00:08:24,833
Sorry, patient's got a rectal bleed.

159
00:08:24,953 --> 00:08:26,466
- Busy.
- We need you to...

160
00:08:26,586 --> 00:08:28,519
Actually, as you can see, I'm not busy.

161
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,367
It's just a euphemism for
"get the hell out of here."

162
00:08:35,771 --> 00:08:37,353
This is your grief talking.

163
00:08:38,021 --> 00:08:40,045
And, yeah, it is a bit textbook.

164
00:08:40,165 --> 00:08:43,193
So before you give away all your
possessions to the Salvation Army...

165
00:08:43,313 --> 00:08:45,565
My girlfriend's dead.
I'm glad you've read that book before.

166
00:08:45,685 --> 00:08:46,837
I haven't.

167
00:08:46,957 --> 00:08:50,283
I'm late to meet Dr. Olan to brief him
on the cases I'm handing over.

168
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:54,795
Bye.

169
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:08,207
It doesn't bother you that House
wouldn't take just two seconds

170
00:09:08,327 --> 00:09:10,671
- to talk about the patient?
- Wilson's dealing with a lot.

171
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,012
Our patient may be dying.

172
00:09:12,132 --> 00:09:14,396
She was bleeding out her rear.
We're looking up her rear.

173
00:09:14,516 --> 00:09:16,588
We needed House's
expertise to set us on this course?

174
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,885
Her heart rate's slow
bleed should have made it faster.

175
00:09:19,005 --> 00:09:21,001
It can wait till after
we know where it came from,

176
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:23,067
and after he's done dealing
with personal issues.

177
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,902
Yeah? That the way it works around here?
We get cut slack while we deal

178
00:09:26,022 --> 00:09:27,386
with personal issues?

179
00:09:29,406 --> 00:09:32,446
You're not the boss.
Boss gets to make the rules.

180
00:09:32,566 --> 00:09:34,536
Boss gets to ignore...

181
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,467
She's bleeding from...

182
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,241
Nowhere.

183
00:09:42,703 --> 00:09:44,844
- You did an endoscopy?
- And a colonoscopy.

184
00:09:44,964 --> 00:09:46,101
- CT scan?
- Ordered.

185
00:09:46,221 --> 00:09:48,141
It shouldn't show anything
the endoscopy didn't.

186
00:09:48,261 --> 00:09:50,269
- We can't do a CT scan.
- Why not?

187
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,595
We don't need a CT scan.
We don't need House.

188
00:09:52,755 --> 00:09:54,095
Stop grinning and talk.

189
00:09:54,215 --> 00:09:56,240
One of the routine
pre-procedure tests was positive.

190
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,174
Which one?

191
00:09:57,294 --> 00:10:00,065
The one that, if it's positive,
would explain a hormone imbalance

192
00:10:00,185 --> 00:10:02,287
that could screw with
heart rate and blood flow.

193
00:10:04,266 --> 00:10:06,584
Guess she does have a life
beyond her career.

194
00:10:08,114 --> 00:10:09,293
I'm pregnant?

195
00:10:09,413 --> 00:10:11,352
You want me to call the father
and let him know?

196
00:10:11,472 --> 00:10:14,116
Soon as you do some DNA testing,
let me know.

197
00:10:15,877 --> 00:10:17,827
Must be hard
to have a real relationship...

198
00:10:17,947 --> 00:10:19,904
Are you making excuses for me?

199
00:10:20,024 --> 00:10:22,917
- I'm just saying it's understandable.
- You only have to understand something

200
00:10:23,077 --> 00:10:25,294
if it needs an explanation.
I have needs.

201
00:10:25,454 --> 00:10:27,827
I met my needs. End of explanation.

202
00:10:27,947 --> 00:10:29,567
How recently were you...

203
00:10:29,687 --> 00:10:30,424
Needy?

204
00:10:31,393 --> 00:10:34,136
It's been two or three months, at least.

205
00:10:35,691 --> 00:10:36,512
What?

206
00:10:36,763 --> 00:10:37,624
What is it?

207
00:10:38,451 --> 00:10:39,312
Nothing.

208
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:42,272
- Tell me.
- It's actually nothing.

209
00:10:45,332 --> 00:10:48,070
The ultrasound shows
no trace of a baby at all.

210
00:10:50,802 --> 00:10:53,504
Positive pregnancy test, no pregnancy.

211
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:57,252
B12 deficit rectified,
but her heart's slowing even more.

212
00:10:57,372 --> 00:10:59,192
And a bleed should speed her heart rate.

213
00:11:03,544 --> 00:11:05,967
House,
this is the kind of case you love.

214
00:11:06,087 --> 00:11:08,336
Contradictions piling up left and right.

215
00:11:10,619 --> 00:11:15,344
Two false positive pregnancy tests,
bradycardia, lower G.I. Bleed. Go.

216
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:18,557
Choriocarcinoma,
would've triggered pregnancy hormones.

217
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:20,318
Also would have shown on a sonogram.

218
00:11:20,438 --> 00:11:22,268
Immunoglobulin "A" deficiency.

219
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,646
No urinary bleed.

220
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:27,083
If she's had Beta HCG injections,
they can cross-react with...

221
00:11:28,775 --> 00:11:29,874
Keep going.

222
00:11:33,324 --> 00:11:34,946
You're being an idiot.

223
00:11:35,344 --> 00:11:36,920
You're gonna blow up your career.

224
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,364
And six months from now,
when you've moved on from Amber to

225
00:11:39,484 --> 00:11:42,291
Burnt Sienna, you're gonna be stuck
in a mobile oncology truck

226
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:43,993
in Pewaukee, Wisconsin.

227
00:11:44,563 --> 00:11:47,424
I'd need a flow chart
to explain all the ways

228
00:11:47,544 --> 00:11:49,768
in which that was ridiculously
insensitive.

229
00:11:49,888 --> 00:11:52,921
- You can't hide from misery.
- This isn't your business.

230
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,343
My skull was cracked open
trying to save her!

231
00:11:55,503 --> 00:11:57,337
Then we all need
a little tea and sympathy.

232
00:11:57,457 --> 00:11:59,208
I'm through discussing it.

233
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:02,088
Uh, we have a patient.

234
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,557
Who's obviously not going anywhere
with a bloody rectum.

235
00:12:04,677 --> 00:12:06,026
Great to have you back.

236
00:12:06,146 --> 00:12:07,564
- Actually, I'm...
- Actually,

237
00:12:07,684 --> 00:12:10,332
he's about to thrust a tanto
into the belly of his career.

238
00:12:10,452 --> 00:12:12,065
I'm leaving the hospital.

239
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:14,884
I'm sorry,
this is obviously a terrible time

240
00:12:15,004 --> 00:12:16,222
Why are you leaving?

241
00:12:16,721 --> 00:12:18,641
I just need a change of scenery.

242
00:12:18,761 --> 00:12:19,979
Buy a plant.

243
00:12:20,099 --> 00:12:22,337
Rectal bleeding,
two positive pregnancy tests.

244
00:12:22,457 --> 00:12:23,792
There's nothing we can do?

245
00:12:23,912 --> 00:12:26,242
You could ask House to be a grown-up
and respect my decision.

246
00:12:26,362 --> 00:12:29,382
I respect things that deserve respect.
This decision, on the other hand,

247
00:12:29,502 --> 00:12:30,693
is a dog wearing a cape!

248
00:12:30,813 --> 00:12:32,341
Hallucinations. Heart won't respond

249
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:34,473
The patient tested
positive for pregnancy

250
00:12:34,593 --> 00:12:36,361
because the patient is pregnant.

251
00:12:50,483 --> 00:12:51,774
Hey, who are you?

252
00:12:51,934 --> 00:12:54,665
This is Dr. House.
He's too brilliant for introductions.

253
00:12:54,785 --> 00:12:55,820
False positive.

254
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,627
You're too busy to be running
a day care center in your abdomen.

255
00:12:58,747 --> 00:13:00,005
False positive.

256
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,833
Not to mention you should wait
till at least 30 to punish that

257
00:13:02,953 --> 00:13:05,640
pleasure portal
with a 7-pound tissue expander.

258
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,925
I'm 37.

259
00:13:07,045 --> 00:13:08,951
And I thought I wasn't pregnant.

260
00:13:09,838 --> 00:13:10,559
37?

261
00:13:12,498 --> 00:13:13,505
Impressive.

262
00:13:14,852 --> 00:13:17,508
Too bad
you're not passing on those genes.

263
00:13:18,935 --> 00:13:20,657
Does that look false to you?

264
00:13:21,755 --> 00:13:23,767
You were looking in the wrong room.

265
00:13:24,473 --> 00:13:26,642
It's more common
when the egg lands in the oven.

266
00:13:26,802 --> 00:13:28,729
Sometimes
it winds up in the fallopian tubes.

267
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,723
In rare cases, it plummets
through the plumbing entirely.

268
00:13:31,843 --> 00:13:34,008
It's using her intestine
as a blood supply.

269
00:13:34,128 --> 00:13:36,434
It caused the rectal bleed, and now

270
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:40,663
junior Miss Steinem's junior
must be pressing on her vagus nerve,

271
00:13:40,783 --> 00:13:42,755
slowing her heart to a crawl.

272
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:46,579
Yank the fetus. If she survives
the surgery, she'll be fine.

273
00:13:56,861 --> 00:13:58,941
What if she wants to keep the baby?

274
00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:00,551
She doesn't.

275
00:14:00,836 --> 00:14:02,921
We can't take
two seconds to discuss this?

276
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:05,723
Fetuses have been transplanted before.
Whole uteruses too.

277
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,768
Just terminating the fetus
when it's glued to her intestines

278
00:14:08,888 --> 00:14:10,102
is high-risk surgery.

279
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,439
Saving it is a fantasy.
That was at least three seconds.

280
00:14:14,657 --> 00:14:17,347
She's a 37-year-old woman
who deserves...

281
00:14:17,467 --> 00:14:18,975
People get what they get.

282
00:14:19,095 --> 00:14:21,138
It has nothing to do
with what they deserve.

283
00:14:21,258 --> 00:14:23,178
And this has nothing to do
with her genitalia,

284
00:14:23,298 --> 00:14:25,130
and everything to do
with your genetics.

285
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,825
- You told me to get tested.
- I didn't know it was gonna color

286
00:14:27,945 --> 00:14:30,024
your every medical opinion,
every personal opinion.

287
00:14:30,144 --> 00:14:32,583
- You didn't think a death sentence...
- People die!

288
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:35,783
You, Amber, everyone.

289
00:14:36,841 --> 00:14:39,632
Don't act like you just figured
that out. I gave you a diagnosis.

290
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:42,065
If you don't like it, there are exits
on every floor.

291
00:14:59,754 --> 00:15:01,934
I'm sorry to be
so definitive about this.

292
00:15:02,054 --> 00:15:03,767
I know you're still absorbing
the news,

293
00:15:03,887 --> 00:15:05,486
but we have no choice.

294
00:15:05,606 --> 00:15:07,554
Remove the fetus.
Absolutely.

295
00:15:09,623 --> 00:15:12,301
I have no boyfriend, no husband.

296
00:15:12,421 --> 00:15:14,489
I'm on the road with Patty
all the time.

297
00:15:16,652 --> 00:15:17,628
Where do I sign?

298
00:15:23,929 --> 00:15:26,502
- You feel any tenderness back here?
- No, not at all.

299
00:15:28,536 --> 00:15:30,766
Treating professional
sports injuries now?

300
00:15:30,926 --> 00:15:32,001
No, I'm not...

301
00:15:32,177 --> 00:15:34,101
Familiar with the concept
of sarcasm.

302
00:15:34,346 --> 00:15:35,834
Don't sweat it, it's new.

303
00:15:36,098 --> 00:15:38,825
- Have you spoken to Wilson?
- We'll get you an EKG, I come back.

304
00:15:38,945 --> 00:15:41,014
You want me to sleep with him
to get him to stay?

305
00:15:41,134 --> 00:15:43,467
I put the bisexual chick on that.

306
00:15:43,587 --> 00:15:45,601
If you'd like to sit in,
so to speak...

307
00:15:45,721 --> 00:15:48,034
- I spoke to him.
- What'd you tell him?

308
00:15:48,154 --> 00:15:50,067
I didn't tell him anything.
I listened.

309
00:15:50,187 --> 00:15:52,467
So you could feel good
about doing nothing.

310
00:15:52,587 --> 00:15:53,418
Tell him...

311
00:15:53,538 --> 00:15:55,873
I am not your errand girl.
Best thing about leaving you...

312
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,140
The two of you used to be together?

313
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,754
She dumped me when I lost
the last 85 pounds.

314
00:16:02,445 --> 00:16:04,111
Said there was less of me to love.

315
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,634
Grief means different things
to different people.

316
00:16:06,795 --> 00:16:09,004
Case in point,
means very little to you.

317
00:16:09,124 --> 00:16:10,377
Grief is Newark.

318
00:16:10,676 --> 00:16:12,349
Okay, it's there.
You can't avoid it.

319
00:16:12,509 --> 00:16:14,935
The idea is to hold your nose,
hope the traffic's not too bad,

320
00:16:15,095 --> 00:16:17,688
and get on to Manhattan as quickly
as possible, not to buy property.

321
00:16:17,955 --> 00:16:20,816
- You think that's facing up to things?
- I'm not the one who's quitting.

322
00:16:20,976 --> 00:16:23,461
- 'cause you haven't lost anything.
- But you have.

323
00:16:23,812 --> 00:16:24,915
He'll listen to you.

324
00:16:25,564 --> 00:16:27,363
What did you do
when your husband died?

325
00:16:28,323 --> 00:16:30,350
I got a new job and I moved.

326
00:16:32,678 --> 00:16:34,371
See how crappy
that worked out?

327
00:16:38,587 --> 00:16:39,606
Separating

328
00:16:40,852 --> 00:16:43,613
the placenta from the wall
of the large intestine.

329
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,034
Sponge.

330
00:16:46,385 --> 00:16:48,215
Suction.
We've got some bleeding.

331
00:16:48,858 --> 00:16:50,679
BP's dropping. 90 systolic.

332
00:16:50,954 --> 00:16:53,557
- She's bleeding like hell. Clamp.
- BP's still dropping.

333
00:16:53,825 --> 00:16:55,640
Amp of calcium chloride, fast!

334
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,119
- still dropping.
- Shut up! Squeeze her spleen.

335
00:16:58,239 --> 00:17:00,341
We need to force platelets out
so her blood clots.

336
00:17:00,461 --> 00:17:02,907
She's in weak shape.
Spleen's friable. It could rupture.

337
00:17:08,511 --> 00:17:09,698
She's stabilizing.

338
00:17:10,214 --> 00:17:11,325
Oozing's drying up.

339
00:17:12,881 --> 00:17:14,360
I hate visitors day.

340
00:17:16,782 --> 00:17:17,956
Removing the fetus.

341
00:17:27,159 --> 00:17:30,767
You have to stop Wilson
from committing career malpractice.

342
00:17:32,034 --> 00:17:34,682
- Talk to him.
- I already talked to him twice.

343
00:17:34,802 --> 00:17:35,766
He threw me out.

344
00:17:36,404 --> 00:17:38,101
Mocking him and insulting him...

345
00:17:38,345 --> 00:17:41,772
Let's see, yes, technically
those are categories of conversation.

346
00:17:41,932 --> 00:17:43,929
Block his references
to other hospitals.

347
00:17:44,049 --> 00:17:46,028
Tell him he can't
hand off his cases until...

348
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,155
Talk to him.

349
00:17:47,771 --> 00:17:50,150
Deal with his grief. Talk to him
about what he's going through.

350
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,768
That's a brilliant idea.
I'll take him out for a beer.

351
00:17:53,061 --> 00:17:55,301
That'll make up for the fact
that Amber's in a pine box.

352
00:17:55,421 --> 00:17:57,996
That there's randomness
and chaos in the universe.

353
00:17:58,156 --> 00:17:59,682
Tell him you're sorry.

354
00:17:59,802 --> 00:18:01,235
I didn't kill her.

355
00:18:01,493 --> 00:18:02,677
You were drunk and...

356
00:18:02,797 --> 00:18:06,565
Yeah, if her daddy hadn't been drunk,
she might never have been born. So...

357
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:08,634
You called her up
in the middle of the night.

358
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,591
She was on the bus because of you.

359
00:18:10,963 --> 00:18:12,567
I didn't ask her to come out.

360
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:15,309
I wasn't driving the bus.
I wasn't driving the garbage truck

361
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:16,490
that hit the bus.

362
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:18,809
And I did not prescribe her
the flu meds that killed her.

363
00:18:19,147 --> 00:18:21,198
Yes, I know, that's all true.
But.

364
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:27,608
You really don't feel
any sense of guilt?

365
00:18:32,566 --> 00:18:34,853
You want to keep him,
he needs to know he's not alone.

366
00:18:34,973 --> 00:18:36,981
Just tell him you feel like crap.

367
00:18:38,495 --> 00:18:39,885
It'd be meaningless.

368
00:18:40,491 --> 00:18:42,168
Well, then,
find some meaning.

369
00:18:42,764 --> 00:18:44,082
And do something.

370
00:18:54,129 --> 00:18:56,568
- She's got a neurological problem.
- Surgical complication?

371
00:18:56,688 --> 00:18:58,334
Don't think so.
She keeps on blinking.

372
00:18:58,454 --> 00:19:01,185
- Her heart's not recovering either.
- So the pregnancy was a coincidence.

373
00:19:01,345 --> 00:19:03,604
Pulse is down to 39.
She's maxed out on atropine.

374
00:19:03,764 --> 00:19:06,014
We're installing a pacing wire to...

375
00:19:06,296 --> 00:19:07,950
avoid that. We need some help!

376
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,443
- Page House.
- Already done.

377
00:19:09,603 --> 00:19:10,767
Page him again.

378
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,944
- It's for you.
- If I told you that I was sorry,

379
00:19:22,657 --> 00:19:25,709
- would it change anything?
- I wouldn't believe you.

380
00:19:26,004 --> 00:19:27,371
If you believe me.

381
00:19:27,881 --> 00:19:29,880
It's hard to imagine
such a world.

382
00:19:30,505 --> 00:19:31,757
I'm going home...

383
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,761
Until you agree to stay
at this hospital.

384
00:19:37,111 --> 00:19:39,389
You can't be... That's blackmail.

385
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:42,225
And to do your job?
Why not hold a gun to your own head?

386
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:45,376
Your conscience bleeds
more freely than my head.

387
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:49,740
Text.

388
00:19:50,516 --> 00:19:52,277
Patient's in cardiac arrest.

389
00:19:52,514 --> 00:19:53,320
Ouchy.

390
00:19:54,915 --> 00:19:56,455
You'd jeopardize
a patient

391
00:19:56,575 --> 00:19:58,325
- because of my...
- If it keeps you here.

392
00:20:00,005 --> 00:20:02,492
Your friendship matters
more to me than this patient.

393
00:20:04,567 --> 00:20:06,308
I've gotta do what's right
for me.

394
00:20:06,428 --> 00:20:08,198
You've gotta do what's right
for you.

395
00:20:10,551 --> 00:20:12,130
But it comes easier for me.

396
00:20:21,426 --> 00:20:22,508
Where is he?

397
00:20:23,301 --> 00:20:24,393
Where is he?

398
00:20:38,215 --> 00:20:39,867
- Status.
- Her heart's stabilized.

399
00:20:40,027 --> 00:20:42,870
We have a pacing wire in her, but
the bradycardia isn't getting better.

400
00:20:43,188 --> 00:20:44,371
House is bluffing.

401
00:20:44,531 --> 00:20:46,119
I called him. He's not picking up.

402
00:20:46,239 --> 00:20:48,332
- What do we do?
- What you'd do if he was here.

403
00:20:48,493 --> 00:20:50,376
If he was here, we'd be
asking him what to do.

404
00:20:51,527 --> 00:20:53,554
- What are the usual suspects?
- There aren't any.

405
00:20:53,674 --> 00:20:55,674
She had a vitamin deficiency,
and we corrected it,

406
00:20:55,834 --> 00:20:58,697
- an ectopic pregnancy, we removed it.
- But her heart problem won't go away,

407
00:20:58,817 --> 00:21:00,755
and now something's wrong
with her brain.

408
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,784
I have complete confidence
in you guys.

409
00:21:06,482 --> 00:21:08,200
Who wants to go service House

410
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,866
so this patient can live?

411
00:21:09,986 --> 00:21:12,816
We can do this without him. Maybe
something happened during the surgery.

412
00:21:13,132 --> 00:21:14,818
It was on her bowel, not her brain.

413
00:21:14,978 --> 00:21:17,352
Anxiety, stroke, Tourette's
could all cause eye blinking.

414
00:21:17,472 --> 00:21:19,488
Cause her heart to beat faster,
It's slowing down.

415
00:21:19,608 --> 00:21:20,372
M.S.

416
00:21:20,492 --> 00:21:22,796
If a lesion took out the sympathetic
innervation of her heart,

417
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,578
It'd explain bradycardia and blinking.

418
00:21:24,738 --> 00:21:27,706
But not the vitamin deficiency
or the ectopic pregnancy.

419
00:21:27,866 --> 00:21:31,464
- House would want a unifying theory.
- He's gone, and so are those symptoms.

420
00:21:31,584 --> 00:21:34,412
M.S. explains everything
that's wrong with her right now.

421
00:21:34,532 --> 00:21:36,265
Start her on interferon for M.S.

422
00:21:42,392 --> 00:21:43,498
Mind if I come in?

423
00:21:44,108 --> 00:21:46,098
- Not at all.
- You mind if I leave?

424
00:21:48,244 --> 00:21:51,777
I told you not to take that case
specifically to deal with Wilson.

425
00:21:51,897 --> 00:21:54,816
And the two ended up dovetailing
rather nicely, don't you think?

426
00:21:54,983 --> 00:21:58,077
Is this how you show your friendship...
By bludgeoning him with guilt?

427
00:21:58,197 --> 00:22:00,430
Because he's my friend,
I know what works on him.

428
00:22:00,828 --> 00:22:03,533
- You can't walk away from a patient.
- Then fire me.

429
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:06,286
You're willing to risk your career,
but youcan't say you're sorry.

430
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:08,697
I told him I'm sorry.
He didn't believe it.

431
00:22:08,865 --> 00:22:10,457
- Make him believe it.
- I don't.

432
00:22:10,617 --> 00:22:12,221
You don't want to believe it.

433
00:22:12,341 --> 00:22:14,962
Because if you tell Wilson
how you actually feel about him,

434
00:22:15,122 --> 00:22:16,713
about what happened to Amber,

435
00:22:16,983 --> 00:22:20,653
about your part in what happened,
and he walks out the door anyway...

436
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:22,594
If you make yourself
vulnerable for once

437
00:22:22,755 --> 00:22:25,494
in your nerve-deadening,
emotionally obliterating...

438
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,597
You're doing the same thing he is.

439
00:22:28,717 --> 00:22:30,022
You're running away.

440
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:32,347
Only he's not killing anyone
in the process.

441
00:22:37,379 --> 00:22:38,764
Where's Dr. House?

442
00:22:39,394 --> 00:22:40,688
He's not feeling well.

443
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:43,198
Was M.S. his idea?

444
00:22:43,585 --> 00:22:44,996
We work as a team.

445
00:22:45,116 --> 00:22:47,028
You know how it is. Collaborative.

446
00:22:47,148 --> 00:22:49,216
Sometimes it's hard to tell
where an idea mes from.

447
00:22:49,336 --> 00:22:52,063
But you're not really a team.

448
00:22:52,409 --> 00:22:53,696
You work for him.

449
00:22:56,146 --> 00:22:57,713
And you work for Patty.

450
00:22:58,383 --> 00:23:00,547
I'm sure a lot of her ideas
are actually...

451
00:23:01,293 --> 00:23:02,985
She would be fine without me.

452
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:05,930
I'd be nothing
without her.

453
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,821
Maybe if you just had the chance.

454
00:23:08,486 --> 00:23:10,017
I'm sure you've learned a lot.

455
00:23:10,675 --> 00:23:12,714
Not everybody's created equal.

456
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:17,036
Does Dr. House think I have M.S.?

457
00:23:26,356 --> 00:23:27,724
Did you just shiver?

458
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,182
You're running a slight fever.

459
00:23:32,302 --> 00:23:33,430
Is that bad?

460
00:23:34,575 --> 00:23:36,341
It means we were
wrong about the M.S.

461
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:43,963
- You had my cable disconnected!
- That's quite a leap.

462
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:46,595
Just because I happen to have
a 31-person maintenance department...

463
00:23:46,755 --> 00:23:48,388
each of whom you've personally abused

464
00:23:48,548 --> 00:23:50,034
- at some point...
- Why?

465
00:23:50,635 --> 00:23:52,230
You thought I could let someone die,

466
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,444
but I'm gonna fold
if I can't watch Celebrity Bowling?

467
00:23:54,564 --> 00:23:56,497
That is not an unreasonable theory.

468
00:23:56,617 --> 00:23:59,278
Especially with only ten minutes
till your favorite soap.

469
00:23:59,616 --> 00:24:02,817
Gee, is this the remote
from the doctors' lounge?

470
00:24:07,568 --> 00:24:08,712
This is your 911?

471
00:24:09,225 --> 00:24:10,456
- Good-bye.
- Stop!

472
00:24:12,322 --> 00:24:15,084
I'm withholding your salary history
from every hospital in this region.

473
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:16,204
You go, girl.

474
00:24:16,631 --> 00:24:19,743
And I'm permanently setting
every TV in this building

475
00:24:19,863 --> 00:24:23,817
to the pottery channel
unless you both sit down.

476
00:24:25,418 --> 00:24:27,089
Welcome to couples counseling.

477
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,374
- It's not the surgery.
- The timing fits.

478
00:24:30,494 --> 00:24:32,599
The location doesn't,
unless brains are in bowels

479
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:35,768
If bacteria entered her bloodstream,
it could have infected her brain.

480
00:24:35,929 --> 00:24:37,962
The surgery went fine.
You were there.

481
00:24:38,082 --> 00:24:40,357
Peptostreptococcus
could explain the blinking and...

482
00:24:40,706 --> 00:24:43,175
You want to watch a grainy video
and have an epiphany.

483
00:24:43,295 --> 00:24:45,987
Shut up. You're making me miss
House's mocking.

484
00:24:47,851 --> 00:24:49,837
You told us
it was none of our business,

485
00:24:49,957 --> 00:24:52,039
but if your Huntington's
is affecting you,

486
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,954
- maybe it...
- It's not, I don't have...

487
00:24:54,074 --> 00:24:55,731
You're desperate to do it
without him.

488
00:24:55,851 --> 00:24:57,707
You're not trying to cure her,
but to prove...

489
00:24:57,867 --> 00:24:59,000
Stop the tape.

490
00:25:00,522 --> 00:25:01,541
Zoom in.

491
00:25:05,542 --> 00:25:08,364
- On the anastomosis, that little bump.
- It's a hematoma.

492
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:12,366
A harmless pocket of blood, which is
why Chase ignored it during the surgery.

493
00:25:12,486 --> 00:25:15,190
Could be a ganglioma, which is why Chase
shouldn't have ignored it.

494
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,916
It's an abnormal growth of nerves,

495
00:25:18,036 --> 00:25:19,938
it could be causing
all the patient's symptoms.

496
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,733
We have to open her up again.
Get a piece of it.

497
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,840
- So what do you want to tell us?
- Nothing.

498
00:25:32,517 --> 00:25:35,257
Nothing I say is gonna change anything.
You guys need to talk.

499
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,663
Actually, you should read
the psych literature.

500
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:39,963
Repression's gaining a lot of fans.

501
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,797
- What you don't face can't crush you.
- Talk to each other.

502
00:25:45,522 --> 00:25:47,689
- How you doing? Good?
- Fine, thanks.

503
00:25:50,291 --> 00:25:51,052
Sit!

504
00:25:53,338 --> 00:25:55,031
See, the two of you are friends.

505
00:25:55,151 --> 00:25:57,172
- Look how you both...
- Think you're an idiot.

506
00:25:57,292 --> 00:25:59,251
We both also eat with forks.

507
00:25:59,468 --> 00:26:01,395
- That doesn't really prove...
- Talk to him!

508
00:26:01,556 --> 00:26:03,730
Tell him how you feel
about what he's doing.

509
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:05,025
He's an idiot.

510
00:26:05,185 --> 00:26:07,569
Tell him what you think
about him leaving.

511
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:10,362
- I think he's an idiot.
- You're an idiot. He's in pain.

512
00:26:10,524 --> 00:26:12,697
And your response is just
to emotionally blackmail him.

513
00:26:12,817 --> 00:26:14,367
You told me your position.

514
00:26:14,749 --> 00:26:17,586
- You're against it, right?
- She hasn't told you in front of me.

515
00:26:17,706 --> 00:26:20,458
- She needs to prove she's on my side.
- Go to hell.

516
00:26:21,034 --> 00:26:23,930
- So much for that theory.
- I'm sorry you lost Amber.

517
00:26:24,204 --> 00:26:26,388
I cannot imagine what it is
you're going through.

518
00:26:26,508 --> 00:26:28,711
But it will not get better
by you walking away

519
00:26:28,831 --> 00:26:30,866
from everyone that cares about you.

520
00:26:31,629 --> 00:26:34,298
Do you think Amber
would want you to walk away?

521
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,086
Nobody at this hospital
even liked Amber.

522
00:26:45,338 --> 00:26:46,855
Same time next week?

523
00:26:49,987 --> 00:26:53,245
You want me to do
a second major surgery

524
00:26:53,365 --> 00:26:56,468
on a patient we almost lost
during a first major surgery

525
00:26:56,588 --> 00:26:59,028
to see if she needs
a third major surgery?

526
00:26:59,148 --> 00:27:00,704
We need a piece of the ganglioma.

527
00:27:00,824 --> 00:27:02,832
Then you're talking
about another patient.

528
00:27:02,992 --> 00:27:04,635
Yours doesn't have a ganglioma.

529
00:27:04,755 --> 00:27:06,627
And if there is one
and you missed it?

530
00:27:06,788 --> 00:27:10,005
So you're talking about another surgeon.
I didn't miss anything.

531
00:27:10,166 --> 00:27:12,692
But we're not talking about another
videotape. It showed a bump.

532
00:27:12,812 --> 00:27:14,529
- We need to biopsy.
- A bump?

533
00:27:16,366 --> 00:27:18,014
My grandfather died of a bump.

534
00:27:19,796 --> 00:27:22,730
She can't survive a second round
of general anesthesia,

535
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,812
- let alone a third.
- You'd do this for House.

536
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,465
What do you suggest?

537
00:27:28,585 --> 00:27:30,969
Because the patient's got
a high fever, a low heart rate,

538
00:27:31,089 --> 00:27:33,905
and a dim chance of survival
if we stand here like idiots.

539
00:27:34,201 --> 00:27:36,900
Then I suggest
you don't stand there like idiots.

540
00:27:39,785 --> 00:27:42,741
How do you get coal out of a mountain
when it's someone else's mountain?

541
00:27:43,966 --> 00:27:46,084
If we don't have House,
we can think like him.

542
00:27:46,245 --> 00:27:48,572
But it does mean we don't have
to talk like him.

543
00:27:48,692 --> 00:27:50,679
You don't dig down.
You go in from the side.

544
00:27:50,968 --> 00:27:52,854
We insert a lighted scope
through the rectum,

545
00:27:52,974 --> 00:27:54,940
move the intestine till we find
the ganglioma,

546
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,929
then push it to the surface.
Where we see the light, we cut.

547
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:04,770
We'll make as small
an incision as we can.

548
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:07,355
But unfortunately,
it'll be very painful.

549
00:28:07,756 --> 00:28:10,078
After your surgery experience,
we can't give you anesthesia.

550
00:28:10,198 --> 00:28:11,443
Can I talk to Dr. House?

551
00:28:12,931 --> 00:28:13,772
No.

552
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:16,583
We can do this.
We know what we're doing.

553
00:28:16,703 --> 00:28:19,575
I don't mean to be insulting,
but my former boss

554
00:28:19,736 --> 00:28:21,834
didn't insist on me coming here
because of you or...

555
00:28:21,954 --> 00:28:23,135
Your former boss?

556
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:24,946
I've been replaced.

557
00:28:27,647 --> 00:28:29,891
- I'm sorry. You must be...
- I'm fine.

558
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:33,172
She has a big Beijing trip.
Ton of work to do.

559
00:28:33,334 --> 00:28:35,592
She can't just wait for me
to get better.

560
00:28:38,135 --> 00:28:40,221
We've been well-trained.
We'll take good care of you.

561
00:28:47,581 --> 00:28:49,564
How can you let her treat you
like a footstool?

562
00:28:51,207 --> 00:28:53,526
- The world needs flunkies.
- Don't say that.

563
00:28:53,896 --> 00:28:55,085
You're better than that.

564
00:28:55,205 --> 00:28:57,280
I have no problem with it.
Why do you?

565
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:01,201
Because...
Life is short.

566
00:29:01,361 --> 00:29:03,202
Yours could've ended in that surgery.

567
00:29:03,364 --> 00:29:04,954
You'd have never lived for yourself.

568
00:29:06,084 --> 00:29:08,750
What kind of feminist...
We can have anything.

569
00:29:08,911 --> 00:29:09,792
No, we can't.

570
00:29:11,809 --> 00:29:13,281
We can aspire to anything.

571
00:29:14,963 --> 00:29:17,175
But we don't get it just
because we want it.

572
00:29:18,586 --> 00:29:21,017
I would rather spend my life
close to the birds

573
00:29:21,137 --> 00:29:23,136
than waste it wishing I had wings.

574
00:29:34,258 --> 00:29:36,903
You're through the sigmoid,
into the descending colon.

575
00:29:37,082 --> 00:29:38,488
Switching on the light.

576
00:29:38,648 --> 00:29:40,197
Advance toward the anastomosis.

577
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:43,768
That's it.

578
00:29:44,672 --> 00:29:46,788
Push the wall of the intestine
toward the skin.

579
00:29:52,287 --> 00:29:53,587
There, I see it.

580
00:29:55,657 --> 00:29:56,757
Don't look down.

581
00:29:58,001 --> 00:29:58,879
Scalpel.

582
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:16,203
So your last day is Friday.

583
00:30:17,186 --> 00:30:18,454
I'm gonna miss you.

584
00:30:19,593 --> 00:30:20,643
You shouldn't go.

585
00:30:21,469 --> 00:30:24,165
Did house ask you to talk to me,
or are you trying to save the patient?

586
00:30:24,285 --> 00:30:26,244
- Because there'll always be...
- House asked me.

587
00:30:26,404 --> 00:30:28,580
- And you're doing it.
- I told him to go to hell.

588
00:30:30,545 --> 00:30:31,749
Thanks.

589
00:30:32,049 --> 00:30:33,333
But I think he's right.

590
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:40,675
You think you're making
a rational choice.

591
00:30:40,835 --> 00:30:42,301
You think the worst is over.

592
00:30:43,402 --> 00:30:44,453
And then...

593
00:30:45,213 --> 00:30:48,616
Six months later you look back
and you realize...

594
00:30:48,736 --> 00:30:50,588
You didn't know what you were doing.

595
00:30:50,708 --> 00:30:52,650
Are you saying the pain doesn't go away?

596
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:53,729
It gets easier.

597
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:56,608
Not in two months.
Not in two years.

598
00:30:57,526 --> 00:30:58,943
But no...

599
00:30:59,693 --> 00:31:01,029
It never really goes away.

600
00:31:01,456 --> 00:31:02,459
Being here...

601
00:31:03,235 --> 00:31:04,884
This building...

602
00:31:05,709 --> 00:31:07,963
I was just in the lounge.
I kept staring at Amber's locker.

603
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:09,829
I saw a guy wearing
a scarf this morning.

604
00:31:10,329 --> 00:31:12,351
The color reminded me of his eyes.

605
00:31:13,192 --> 00:31:15,310
We lived 500 miles from here.

606
00:31:17,089 --> 00:31:19,202
- I have to do something.
- Then do it.

607
00:31:22,001 --> 00:31:24,685
But don't think it's the right choice,
because...

608
00:31:27,224 --> 00:31:28,223
There isn't one.

609
00:31:31,023 --> 00:31:32,186
It's not a ganglioma.

610
00:31:32,387 --> 00:31:35,271
- The problem wasn't the surgery.
- Abnormally deposited proteins.

611
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:38,713
It's amyloidosis. That would explain
the blinking and the low heart rate.

612
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:41,319
Only way to treat amyloidosis is
to treat whatever's causing it.

613
00:31:41,479 --> 00:31:43,714
It's not as if a lot of things
cause amyloid.

614
00:31:43,834 --> 00:31:45,000
Rheumatoid arthritis.

615
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,573
Familial mediterranean fever.

616
00:31:46,735 --> 00:31:47,784
Lymphoma.

617
00:31:47,944 --> 00:31:50,372
We can't all be right.
But you can all be wrong.

618
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:51,912
The patient's joints don't hurt,

619
00:31:52,073 --> 00:31:54,791
abdominal pain went away when the fetus
did, and no palpable lymph nodes.

620
00:31:55,178 --> 00:31:57,944
- Got anything constructive to say?
- Sorry. Sorry.

621
00:31:58,494 --> 00:32:02,006
Um, she has lots and lots of palpable
lymph nodes, joint and abdominal pain.

622
00:32:02,166 --> 00:32:03,694
She'll be better by dinnertime.

623
00:32:03,814 --> 00:32:05,677
If we don't find the cause
of the amyloidosis,

624
00:32:05,838 --> 00:32:08,638
we never get her off that wire,
she never walks out of this hospital.

625
00:32:10,759 --> 00:32:12,401
But hey, who needs House, hmm?

626
00:32:12,521 --> 00:32:14,227
So glad we lost those training wheels.

627
00:32:17,544 --> 00:32:19,106
You want me to make the call?

628
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:21,789
There seems to be some disagreement.

629
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:25,040
And this isn't just a pretext
to pressure me into staying?

630
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,584
Does it look like a pretext?

631
00:32:27,506 --> 00:32:28,405
No.

632
00:32:29,346 --> 00:32:31,322
She really is dying, isn't she?

633
00:32:33,457 --> 00:32:35,789
Inflammation, enlarged nuclei,

634
00:32:35,951 --> 00:32:38,501
some mitotic activity.
It could be lymphoma.

635
00:32:38,661 --> 00:32:40,199
There are no palpable lymph nodes.

636
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:43,165
It makes it less likely,
but it doesn't rule it out.

637
00:32:44,271 --> 00:32:46,477
I'm an oncologist.
I see cancer.

638
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:48,858
Show it to an immunologist,
they'll see autoimmune.

639
00:32:48,978 --> 00:32:51,144
I already showed it to an immunologist.

640
00:32:52,067 --> 00:32:53,491
We'll start her on chemo.

641
00:32:56,125 --> 00:32:57,229
You should leave.

642
00:32:58,114 --> 00:33:00,296
House doesn't want to lose his sidekick.

643
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:02,734
Cuddy doesn't want to lose
her check on house.

644
00:33:02,854 --> 00:33:04,485
No one's talking about what you want.

645
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:07,061
It's not that I want to.

646
00:33:07,414 --> 00:33:08,854
Want to, need to.

647
00:33:10,098 --> 00:33:12,755
If there's any chance that being
away from here will make your life

648
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:15,534
even a little bit easier, do it.

649
00:33:16,941 --> 00:33:18,958
That's what everyone else
here would do.

650
00:33:38,322 --> 00:33:40,396
Don't expect anything
to change too fast.

651
00:33:40,796 --> 00:33:42,148
Lymphoma was your idea?

652
00:33:43,658 --> 00:33:45,729
- Why?
- I feel better.

653
00:33:46,715 --> 00:33:48,696
Sometimes just knowing
you're being treated helps.

654
00:33:49,237 --> 00:33:50,888
You've given me 18 different treatments.

655
00:33:51,008 --> 00:33:53,201
This is the first one
that made me feel better.

656
00:33:53,928 --> 00:33:55,813
I don't think it's psychological.

657
00:33:57,405 --> 00:33:58,376
Thank you.

658
00:34:00,592 --> 00:34:01,417
I'm sorry.

659
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:07,298
I shouldn't have gotten angry at you.
Your choices are your choices.

660
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:09,967
You're not like me.

661
00:34:12,604 --> 00:34:14,140
Maybe you have wings.

662
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,216
I have huntington's chorea.

663
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,558
Dozen years or so, my...

664
00:34:30,216 --> 00:34:33,920
nervous system, my cognitive skills,
even my emotional balance...

665
00:34:34,308 --> 00:34:35,576
They'll all start to fray.

666
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,257
I won't be able to fly.

667
00:34:39,758 --> 00:34:41,129
I won't be able to walk.

668
00:34:42,378 --> 00:34:43,981
I won't be able to breathe.

669
00:34:46,842 --> 00:34:48,840
And you want to make sure
your life matters.

670
00:34:51,241 --> 00:34:52,713
I don't want to just...

671
00:34:54,039 --> 00:34:57,423
Be tightening bolts
and following instructions.

672
00:34:57,543 --> 00:34:59,068
I want something...

673
00:35:00,863 --> 00:35:03,813
To be different because of me.

674
00:35:04,955 --> 00:35:05,982
I am.

675
00:35:08,936 --> 00:35:10,570
Not just 'cause you saved my life.

676
00:35:13,482 --> 00:35:15,825
I'm applying for a job at a foundation.

677
00:35:16,566 --> 00:35:18,281
Running the finance division.

678
00:35:20,197 --> 00:35:22,683
I mean, I don't know
if I'm gonna get it, but...

679
00:35:23,229 --> 00:35:26,586
If I don't...
There are other foundations.

680
00:35:33,624 --> 00:35:34,756
It's almost 4:00.

681
00:35:35,546 --> 00:35:36,512
Soap time.

682
00:35:39,187 --> 00:35:41,434
Nurses' remote.
Works in the doctors' lounge.

683
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,478
Why do you think Wilson's leaving?

684
00:35:47,224 --> 00:35:49,776
How many times do I have
to use the word "idiot"?

685
00:35:49,936 --> 00:35:51,569
That's a good enough answer for you?

686
00:35:51,729 --> 00:35:53,612
Whenever anyone does
anything out of the norm,

687
00:35:53,773 --> 00:35:57,575
you have to tell them what screwed-up
process is really at work in their head.

688
00:35:57,735 --> 00:35:59,630
That is why I locked
the two of you in a room.

689
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:02,163
So you would say something
stupid and insensitive,

690
00:36:02,323 --> 00:36:04,617
and maybe with a little bit of truth.

691
00:36:05,117 --> 00:36:06,527
But you didn't.

692
00:36:07,203 --> 00:36:10,338
So I can only assume
that you don't want to know the reason.

693
00:36:11,251 --> 00:36:12,694
You're afraid to know.

694
00:36:15,878 --> 00:36:17,428
You're not listening to me, are you?

695
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:21,015
Try it sometime.
You'll see why.

696
00:36:30,849 --> 00:36:31,734
You look 37.

697
00:36:32,207 --> 00:36:33,611
I am 37.

698
00:36:34,876 --> 00:36:36,541
You looked 27 last week.

699
00:36:37,447 --> 00:36:39,575
Unless I blacked out for ten years.
Your skin...

700
00:36:39,735 --> 00:36:41,869
She's got lymphoma.
The chemo's probably...

701
00:36:42,029 --> 00:36:43,989
- Stop the chemo.
- She's getting better.

702
00:36:44,109 --> 00:36:46,623
- Bradycardia's improving, we...
- She have bruising?

703
00:36:46,784 --> 00:36:49,090
She was pounding her legs
during the hallucinations.

704
00:36:49,777 --> 00:36:51,144
It's not lymphoma.

705
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:54,507
Hey, don't...
No, no, no.

706
00:36:57,878 --> 00:36:59,064
My bad.

707
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,569
Thought no meant yes.

708
00:37:02,425 --> 00:37:03,640
Those aren't bruises.

709
00:37:04,064 --> 00:37:05,852
They're mycobacterial lesions.

710
00:37:06,013 --> 00:37:08,229
She has diffuse lepromatous leprosy.

711
00:37:08,994 --> 00:37:11,482
Must have caught it on one
of her overseas estrogen tours.

712
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:15,570
Chemo wipes out some of the bacteria,
she feels a little better.

713
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:18,197
Wipes out most of her immune system,
she gets a whole lot worse.

714
00:37:18,508 --> 00:37:19,489
Leprosy?!

715
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:21,492
Like where my limbs fall off?

716
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,883
Actually, this is the flattering one.

717
00:37:24,003 --> 00:37:25,871
It's also known as "pretty leprosy".

718
00:37:26,033 --> 00:37:29,041
It doesn't disfigure, it makes
your skin look younger, smoother.

719
00:37:29,201 --> 00:37:30,418
Don't let the girls hear.

720
00:37:30,735 --> 00:37:32,253
They'll all want to lick your face.

721
00:37:32,413 --> 00:37:35,102
Unless you're that kind of feminist.

722
00:37:36,127 --> 00:37:38,009
Blast her with antibiotics
and Prednisone.

723
00:37:38,384 --> 00:37:39,468
She'll be fine.

724
00:37:40,309 --> 00:37:42,263
Damn, it's after 4:00.
I'm late.

725
00:37:45,507 --> 00:37:47,018
- Damn.
- What?

726
00:37:47,685 --> 00:37:49,145
She's happy you're gonna be fine.

727
00:37:49,755 --> 00:37:52,815
But she'd be happier if you were gonna
be fine five minutes ago.

728
00:38:00,983 --> 00:38:02,617
Tests confirmed Dr. House's diagnosis.

729
00:38:04,376 --> 00:38:05,443
Thank God.

730
00:38:07,631 --> 00:38:09,373
When you got pregnant,

731
00:38:09,717 --> 00:38:12,793
he physical stress triggered
e. Nodosum Lleprosum.

732
00:38:12,953 --> 00:38:14,794
A common complication of leprosy.

733
00:38:15,572 --> 00:38:17,214
Inflamed the nerves to your heart.

734
00:38:17,374 --> 00:38:20,676
Made it hard to absorb vitamins,
scarred your fallopian tubes.

735
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,445
It explains everything.

736
00:38:24,661 --> 00:38:27,600
Better prescribe me some
skin cream too?

737
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,852
You might want it
for those job interviews.

738
00:38:31,486 --> 00:38:34,809
I'm going back on the road with Patty.
My replacement flamed out.

739
00:38:37,623 --> 00:38:41,470
She says I can manage some projects
on my own, carve out more of a role.

740
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,950
Do you really think she can change?

741
00:38:45,126 --> 00:38:46,192
I don't know.

742
00:38:48,717 --> 00:38:51,248
The truth is, I'm not sure I...

743
00:38:51,408 --> 00:38:52,625
You can change.

744
00:38:52,786 --> 00:38:53,762
No...

745
00:38:55,574 --> 00:38:57,296
I'm not sure I want her to change.

746
00:38:59,956 --> 00:39:01,072
She's reasonable.

747
00:39:01,192 --> 00:39:03,870
She's just another employer,
and I'm just...

748
00:39:05,714 --> 00:39:07,088
another employee.

749
00:39:10,938 --> 00:39:12,507
In a weird way, I matter.

750
00:39:18,264 --> 00:39:20,601
I like you better now that you're dying.

751
00:39:22,291 --> 00:39:23,155
I was wrong.

752
00:39:24,053 --> 00:39:25,347
You took a shot.

753
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:30,264
She's going back to work for that idiot.

754
00:39:31,154 --> 00:39:32,257
It's pathetic.

755
00:39:33,013 --> 00:39:34,542
You thought something would change?

756
00:39:34,906 --> 00:39:37,009
She almost died...

757
00:39:37,478 --> 00:39:40,172
Because of that job.
Yeah, I... I thought...

758
00:39:41,133 --> 00:39:43,217
Almost dying changes nothing.

759
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:49,769
Dying changes everything.

760
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:18,753
I'm sorry.

761
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:23,915
I know I didn't try to kill her.
I know I didn't want her hurt.

762
00:40:25,487 --> 00:40:27,845
I know it was a freak accident.

763
00:40:29,304 --> 00:40:32,271
But I feel like crap, and
she's dead because of me.

764
00:40:34,751 --> 00:40:36,096
I don't blame you.

765
00:40:38,441 --> 00:40:40,356
I wanted to. I tried to.

766
00:40:40,517 --> 00:40:44,379
I must have reviewed Amber's case file
100 times to find a way.

767
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,808
But it wasn't your fault.

768
00:40:51,738 --> 00:40:53,162
Then we're okay?

769
00:40:54,601 --> 00:40:56,584
I mean, I know you're not, but...

770
00:40:59,417 --> 00:41:01,419
- Maybe I can help.
- We're not okay.

771
00:41:03,636 --> 00:41:05,966
Amber was never the reason
I was leaving.

772
00:41:06,757 --> 00:41:08,302
I didn't want to tell you because--

773
00:41:12,127 --> 00:41:14,343
Because I was trying...

774
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:17,353
Like I always do, to protect you.

775
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,714
Which is the problem.

776
00:41:22,347 --> 00:41:26,112
You spread misery because
you can't feel anything else.

777
00:41:26,406 --> 00:41:28,656
You manipulate people
because you can't handle

778
00:41:28,817 --> 00:41:31,658
any kind of real relationship.
And I've enabled it.

779
00:41:32,499 --> 00:41:33,409
For years.

780
00:41:33,571 --> 00:41:37,206
The games, the binges,
the middle-of-the-night phone calls.

781
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:43,384
I should have been
the one on the bus, not...

782
00:41:46,893 --> 00:41:48,817
You should have been alone on the bus.

783
00:41:50,754 --> 00:41:53,973
If I've learned anything from Amber,
it's that I have to take care of myself.

784
00:41:59,815 --> 00:42:01,646
We're not friends anymore, House.

785
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,012
I'm not sure we ever were.

786
