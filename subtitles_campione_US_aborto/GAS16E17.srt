1
00:00:05,362 --> 00:00:08,484
Your body contains aproximately
35 trillion cells,

2
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:11,086
and every one of them
is constantly being pulled down

3
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,755
to Earth by gravity.

4
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:13,789
Look at these losers.

5
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:15,791
Looks like they're eating
each other's faces.

6
00:00:17,316 --> 00:00:18,994
I once made out through a tornado.

7
00:00:19,018 --> 00:00:20,029
Really?

8
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:22,636
Went for gum later,
and the 7-Eleven was gone.

9
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:25,883
And a guitar?

10
00:00:25,907 --> 00:00:27,838
Probably on their way to an open mic.

11
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:30,105
I play guitar.

12
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:31,173
That's different.

13
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:33,008
When you're lying down,
gravitational forces

14
00:00:33,032 --> 00:00:36,045
are spread between
the thorax, abdomen, and legs.

15
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:38,614
Get a dorm, face-eaters!

16
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:41,650
Don't they know that
all love sucks eventually?

17
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:43,852
Too bad there's no sappy love songs about

18
00:00:43,876 --> 00:00:45,220
the part where your husband leaves you,

19
00:00:45,244 --> 00:00:47,056
you cry every time
you see his toothbrush,

20
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,491
so you're living on
your best friend's couch.

21
00:00:49,515 --> 00:00:51,660
Well, stay as long as you want.

22
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:54,830
It's been perfect, hanging out
and watching bad movies,

23
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:57,706
trying every dinner special
at Kung Pao's.

24
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,241
It's been nice to think about anything

25
00:00:59,265 --> 00:01:00,275
other than Amelia.

26
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:02,344
Hear she's back at work,

27
00:01:02,368 --> 00:01:03,378
by the way.

28
00:01:03,402 --> 00:01:05,080
Yeah, I heard that, too.

29
00:01:05,104 --> 00:01:07,349
Stand up too fast,
and blood rushes downward,

30
00:01:07,373 --> 00:01:09,851
away from the brain.

31
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:12,187
It causes dizziness or even fainting.

32
00:01:12,211 --> 00:01:16,671
So, he moved there, and he's not
coming back to say goodbye?

33
00:01:16,695 --> 00:01:18,085
I don't want to talk about it.

34
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:19,518
How's Jo?

35
00:01:19,542 --> 00:01:21,366
She's staying with Link for a few days.

36
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,357
Other than that, she doesn't
want to talk about it.

37
00:01:23,381 --> 00:01:25,059
Oof. This is massive.

38
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:26,815
This is a sea change. How are you?

39
00:01:27,618 --> 00:01:29,730
I don't really want to talk about it.

40
00:01:29,754 --> 00:01:31,098
Ah, right. You're probably not one

41
00:01:31,122 --> 00:01:32,266
to judge someone for leaving town

42
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:35,069
with no goodbye or return date.

43
00:01:36,127 --> 00:01:37,838
It's a minor miracle
our cells get anything

44
00:01:37,862 --> 00:01:38,928
done at all.

45
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:40,274
How's Link? Have you spoken to him?

46
00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:43,978
If Link can't love me for me,
no matter who the father is,

47
00:01:44,002 --> 00:01:45,643
then we don't have anything
to talk about.

48
00:01:45,667 --> 00:01:47,481
Because the human body
has to perform even

49
00:01:47,505 --> 00:01:48,900
the simplest of tasks...

50
00:01:48,924 --> 00:01:51,318
I'm guessing you don't want to
talk about that, either.

51
00:01:51,342 --> 00:01:53,454
...under unimaginable pressure.

52
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:56,423
Well, my mom e-mailed
some venue suggestions... 13.

53
00:01:56,447 --> 00:01:58,659
Planning this wedding
is gonna be a part-time job.

54
00:01:58,683 --> 00:02:00,031
Or a full-time job.

55
00:02:00,055 --> 00:02:01,462
That's why they call it
a wedding planner.

56
00:02:01,486 --> 00:02:02,896
We could hire one.

57
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,099
'Cause you don't want
to plan the wedding?

58
00:02:05,123 --> 00:02:06,967
No, of course... of course I do.

59
00:02:06,991 --> 00:02:08,102
I'm just a little anxious

60
00:02:08,126 --> 00:02:09,203
to check in on one of my patients,

61
00:02:09,227 --> 00:02:10,637
and this elevator just
doesn't seem to want to...

62
00:02:10,661 --> 00:02:13,040
Oh.

63
00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:20,914
You coming or...?

64
00:02:20,938 --> 00:02:22,439
Yep.

65
00:02:27,779 --> 00:02:29,923
Dr. Hunt. Dr. Altman.

66
00:02:29,947 --> 00:02:33,327
Kiddos. You're looking like... kids.

67
00:02:33,351 --> 00:02:34,528
We...

68
00:02:34,552 --> 00:02:36,263
There's a VIP guest today, uh, Hunt.

69
00:02:36,287 --> 00:02:38,132
Uh, Griffin Ford. Tech billionaire...

70
00:02:38,156 --> 00:02:39,767
blew up a rocket over a gas station.

71
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:41,068
Oh, yeah, thanks for the heads up.

72
00:02:41,092 --> 00:02:43,337
Oh, oh, you betcha.

73
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:44,805
Will you be visiting the cardio floor?

74
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:46,340
Depends on how bored he is.

75
00:02:47,899 --> 00:02:50,077
Oh, mm, two more
wedding venues from my mom.

76
00:02:50,101 --> 00:02:51,512
I'll forward them to you.

77
00:02:51,536 --> 00:02:53,814
Maybe it'll help you figure out
what it is you want.

78
00:02:53,838 --> 00:02:55,082
Great. Thanks.

79
00:02:55,106 --> 00:02:56,408
It's important to know what you want.

80
00:02:56,432 --> 00:02:58,552
It's...

81
00:02:58,576 --> 00:02:59,653
Let me know what you think, okay?

82
00:02:59,677 --> 00:03:01,288
Okay, yeah. Love you. Okay.

83
00:03:01,312 --> 00:03:02,489
- You got the kids?
- Yeah.

84
00:03:02,513 --> 00:03:03,757
Okay. Oh! Sorry.

85
00:03:03,781 --> 00:03:04,958
Oh! Hello.

86
00:03:04,982 --> 00:03:05,659
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

87
00:03:05,683 --> 00:03:07,061
Okay.

88
00:03:07,085 --> 00:03:08,685
Okay.

89
00:03:10,188 --> 00:03:11,698
Hey, do you have a minute to discuss

90
00:03:11,722 --> 00:03:13,233
Mr. Paxton's pacemaker?

91
00:03:13,257 --> 00:03:14,252
I do.

92
00:03:14,276 --> 00:03:15,669
Uh, do you want to go get his chart?

93
00:03:15,693 --> 00:03:16,870
Um, sure.

94
00:03:16,894 --> 00:03:18,105
- Great.
- Mm-hmm.

95
00:03:19,263 --> 00:03:20,574
You're acting weird.

96
00:03:20,598 --> 00:03:21,626
I'm being nice.

97
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,277
Which for you, with Owen, is weird.

98
00:03:23,301 --> 00:03:25,212
My pillow still smells like your hair.

99
00:03:25,236 --> 00:03:26,680
I'm supposed to be mean to the guy, too?

100
00:03:26,704 --> 00:03:28,148
Well, he's gonna know something is up.

101
00:03:28,172 --> 00:03:29,543
Something is up.

102
00:03:29,567 --> 00:03:30,951
I mean, as much as I... as I enjoyed

103
00:03:30,975 --> 00:03:33,420
the... the up-ness of it
and hope it continues,

104
00:03:33,444 --> 00:03:35,255
I think we should take a minute
to discuss what it means.

105
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:36,523
It doesn't mean anything.

106
00:03:36,547 --> 00:03:39,593
I'm sorry, but I acted
impulsively because

107
00:03:39,617 --> 00:03:42,908
I'm afraid of... something,
which might not even be true.

108
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:44,574
That wasn't much of an apology.

109
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,610
Tom, you're a good man.

110
00:03:46,634 --> 00:03:48,579
I try to be, but you
haven't been helping.

111
00:03:50,572 --> 00:03:52,116
Hi.

112
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,536
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

113
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,021
Uh, so, Mr. Paxton...
his, uh, last X-ray showed a...

114
00:03:57,045 --> 00:03:58,479
Something is happening.

115
00:03:58,503 --> 00:04:00,481
Well, he did have an arrhythmia.

116
00:04:00,505 --> 00:04:03,518
Yeah, I'm not talking about Mr. Paxton.

117
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:05,152
You asked me if you were crazy.

118
00:04:05,176 --> 00:04:07,221
I said you weren't.
Then I share an elevator ride

119
00:04:07,245 --> 00:04:08,956
with you, and I feel
the need to take a shower.

120
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,591
Okay, fine. I slept with Tom.

121
00:04:10,615 --> 00:04:12,755
What?! No, no, no, no, no!

122
00:04:12,779 --> 00:04:13,589
Don't tell me that!

123
00:04:13,613 --> 00:04:15,024
I thought you were saying that...

124
00:04:15,048 --> 00:04:15,858
I was speculating!

125
00:04:15,882 --> 00:04:17,260
God, talk about a telltale heart.

126
00:04:17,284 --> 00:04:18,761
I know! I know! I feel awful.

127
00:04:18,785 --> 00:04:20,730
I-I panicked, and he was there,

128
00:04:20,754 --> 00:04:22,565
or I went there...

129
00:04:22,589 --> 00:04:24,290
Oh, God, I want to die!

130
00:04:26,226 --> 00:04:27,336
Okay, Mr. Paxton?

131
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,304
I'll cover it.

132
00:04:28,328 --> 00:04:30,640
Great. Thank you.

133
00:04:31,965 --> 00:04:33,376
Oh, no, no, no.

134
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,944
I got it. I got it. I got this.

135
00:04:34,968 --> 00:04:36,512
That is a donation from

136
00:04:36,536 --> 00:04:39,271
the Victoria Hughes apology fund.

137
00:04:40,507 --> 00:04:42,018
I was gonna bake you something.

138
00:04:42,042 --> 00:04:43,386
But...

139
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:44,754
"Sorry I sorta kinda

140
00:04:44,778 --> 00:04:46,289
moved into your place
without telling you,"

141
00:04:46,313 --> 00:04:47,429
doesn't really fit on a cupcake,

142
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:50,326
and I wasn't sure you wanted to see me.

143
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:53,029
I just wanted communication. That's it.

144
00:04:53,053 --> 00:04:54,430
If you need to crash at my place

145
00:04:54,454 --> 00:04:55,731
'cause you're looking for an apartment,

146
00:04:55,755 --> 00:04:56,732
of course you can.

147
00:04:56,756 --> 00:04:58,334
Just maybe ask first.

148
00:04:58,358 --> 00:05:00,436
Yeah. Yeah, well, thanks for the offer.

149
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,242
But I already
found the perfect spot, so...

150
00:05:03,266 --> 00:05:04,373
- Well, good.
- Yeah.

151
00:05:04,397 --> 00:05:05,908
That's good news. What part of town?

152
00:05:05,932 --> 00:05:07,833
Lake Union. Dean's place.

153
00:05:09,436 --> 00:05:10,946
Dean? Really?

154
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,649
Okay, so, he's moved out
of that houseboat?

155
00:05:13,673 --> 00:05:15,885
- No, no, no.
- We're boatmates, I guess.

156
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:17,753
Or, he just had a kid so technically,

157
00:05:17,777 --> 00:05:19,722
I have two boatmates.

158
00:05:19,746 --> 00:05:22,889
But it's great news, right?

159
00:05:23,516 --> 00:05:26,095
It's, uh... It's news.

160
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:28,145
That is certainly news.

161
00:05:30,824 --> 00:05:33,402
Um, well, I'm gonna go see Rigo

162
00:05:33,426 --> 00:05:36,172
and give his wife some coffee.

163
00:05:36,196 --> 00:05:38,230
- Okay.
- All right.

164
00:05:39,432 --> 00:05:41,977
It's really good news, Jackson.

165
00:05:42,001 --> 00:05:44,036
It's all good. No worries.

166
00:05:45,872 --> 00:05:48,551
Who... Who sent you?
Look, I-I want a name.

167
00:05:48,575 --> 00:05:49,552
Was it Catherine?

168
00:05:49,576 --> 00:05:50,953
You know, I want to see
that invoice there.

169
00:05:50,977 --> 00:05:52,054
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

170
00:05:52,078 --> 00:05:53,356
- What?
- Uh, uh,

171
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,958
let's just... I'm sorry.
I'm Chief Bailey.

172
00:05:55,982 --> 00:05:56,920
Can I help you?

173
00:05:56,944 --> 00:05:58,030
He's the one who needs help.

174
00:05:58,054 --> 00:06:00,596
Someone sent back my office
furniture from Pac-North,

175
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,099
and I told these guys
that I didn't send for it,

176
00:06:03,123 --> 00:06:05,768
I don't want it,
and they can take it back!

177
00:06:05,792 --> 00:06:07,436
- Whoa, wait, wait!
- Hey.

178
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,437
A-All of it?

179
00:06:08,461 --> 00:06:10,139
Are you planning on sitting on the floor?

180
00:06:10,163 --> 00:06:11,941
You know what?
I don't have time for this.

181
00:06:11,965 --> 00:06:13,876
I have a skills lab to teach.

182
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,211
Dr. Rager to Peds.

183
00:06:15,235 --> 00:06:16,412
Dr. Sara Rager to Peds.

184
00:06:16,436 --> 00:06:18,337
So, we're taking it all back?

185
00:06:20,807 --> 00:06:22,451
Noelle Webb, 43,

186
00:06:22,475 --> 00:06:23,919
complains of abdominal pain and dizziness

187
00:06:23,943 --> 00:06:25,020
after falling off a ladder.

188
00:06:25,044 --> 00:06:27,490
- Hi, Noelle. I'm Dr. Grey.
- Hi.

189
00:06:27,514 --> 00:06:28,691
Did you just lose your balance?

190
00:06:28,715 --> 00:06:30,459
Do you have any other symptoms?

191
00:06:30,483 --> 00:06:34,363
I-I was painting this house,
and I just got woozy for a sec.

192
00:06:34,387 --> 00:06:36,232
Fumes got to me.

193
00:06:36,256 --> 00:06:38,271
I need my phone.
I think it's still at the site.

194
00:06:38,295 --> 00:06:39,368
Okay.

195
00:06:39,392 --> 00:06:41,508
Noelle, we'll get your phone for you.

196
00:06:41,532 --> 00:06:42,638
Ohh.

197
00:06:42,662 --> 00:06:44,039
Do you have any other health issues

198
00:06:44,063 --> 00:06:45,441
that I need to know about?

199
00:06:45,465 --> 00:06:49,044
Oh, I-I'm a type-1 diabetic,
but I take care of it.

200
00:06:49,068 --> 00:06:51,213
You know, I-I-I'm good about what I eat.

201
00:06:51,237 --> 00:06:52,748
- Oh! Oh!
- When's the last time

202
00:06:52,772 --> 00:06:54,350
you checked your blood sugar?

203
00:06:54,374 --> 00:06:56,485
Recently... ish.

204
00:06:56,509 --> 00:06:58,587
Ohh, my Giggle Days rating

205
00:06:58,611 --> 00:07:00,689
is gonna go in the toilet from this.

206
00:07:00,713 --> 00:07:01,736
- Ooh!
- What's Giggle Days?

207
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,592
It's an app for small jobs.

208
00:07:03,616 --> 00:07:05,928
Gig economy. They think they're cute.

209
00:07:05,952 --> 00:07:07,863
Connects you to people who need help

210
00:07:07,887 --> 00:07:10,733
or their Internet hooked up
or their couch moved,

211
00:07:10,757 --> 00:07:13,536
or, in my case, a house painted.

212
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,172
But it's so un-cute
if my rating goes down.

213
00:07:16,196 --> 00:07:17,506
I see some free fluid there.

214
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,608
What's that? Is that bad?

215
00:07:19,632 --> 00:07:22,545
Well, we just need to run
some more tests to make sure.

216
00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:24,847
Dr. Schmitt, let's admit
her for observation.

217
00:07:24,871 --> 00:07:27,483
Get a full set of labs
and order a CT trauma series.

218
00:07:27,507 --> 00:07:28,684
And my phone!

219
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:31,187
We will ask the paramedics
if they have found your phone.

220
00:07:31,211 --> 00:07:32,946
I'll see you soon, Noelle.

221
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,390
Dr. Daniel to Pediatrics.

222
00:07:36,082 --> 00:07:37,493
Heads up. She may seem nice,

223
00:07:37,517 --> 00:07:39,595
but she just wants a condo on Mars.

224
00:07:39,619 --> 00:07:41,230
Oh, no. No, no, I'll take the kindness,

225
00:07:41,254 --> 00:07:42,765
even if it's insincere.

226
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:45,234
Most of the people in this
city think I'm a monster.

227
00:07:45,258 --> 00:07:47,536
Well, big company, big accident,

228
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,572
classic clickbait. The firefighter,

229
00:07:49,596 --> 00:07:51,373
Rigo Vasquez, is here recovering.

230
00:07:51,397 --> 00:07:52,775
I know he's eager
to thank you for covering his,

231
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:53,943
uh, medical expenses.

232
00:07:53,967 --> 00:07:55,711
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Listen, before we, uh...

233
00:07:55,735 --> 00:07:57,646
before we get to that...

234
00:08:01,007 --> 00:08:03,419
This thing is, uh, catastrophic.

235
00:08:03,443 --> 00:08:05,621
My investors are spooked.

236
00:08:05,645 --> 00:08:07,823
"Woke" Twitter is eating me alive.

237
00:08:07,847 --> 00:08:09,124
Well, th... there were no fatalities.

238
00:08:09,148 --> 00:08:11,494
"Billionaire explodes
rocket over Seattle"

239
00:08:11,518 --> 00:08:13,529
is the only thing anyone cares about.

240
00:08:13,553 --> 00:08:16,465
And now there are rumors
of a criminal investigation.

241
00:08:16,489 --> 00:08:19,768
People got hurt on my watch, by my hand.

242
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:21,670
I made mistakes, Tom.

243
00:08:21,694 --> 00:08:25,341
Mistakes that are... beneath me.

244
00:08:25,365 --> 00:08:27,643
Now, I may fail sometimes.

245
00:08:27,667 --> 00:08:30,579
I was a crap husband, and I suck at golf.

246
00:08:30,603 --> 00:08:32,748
But my critical thinking,

247
00:08:32,772 --> 00:08:35,618
my calculations,
my understanding of physics...

248
00:08:35,642 --> 00:08:37,353
that's never failed me.

249
00:08:37,377 --> 00:08:39,588
Now, I don't know if it's a brain tumor,

250
00:08:39,612 --> 00:08:43,692
some neurological disease,
if it's cancer,

251
00:08:43,716 --> 00:08:49,398
but I need you to find
whatever it is and fix it

252
00:08:49,422 --> 00:08:53,425
before this nightmare wipes out
all the good I've done.

253
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,772
Well, you've come to the right place.

254
00:08:56,796 --> 00:08:59,575
Why don't you text her,
see if she wants to talk?

255
00:08:59,599 --> 00:09:00,643
About what?

256
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:01,810
The baby that might be Owen's

257
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:03,546
or the relationship she just ended?

258
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,581
Or the weather? I'll pass.

259
00:09:05,605 --> 00:09:07,616
If she wants to talk to me,
she can find me.

260
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,951
I'm done chasing her.

261
00:09:08,975 --> 00:09:10,553
Okay.

262
00:09:13,046 --> 00:09:14,757
Brad Spencer, 22.

263
00:09:14,781 --> 00:09:17,059
Found unresponsive with burns
on three extremities.

264
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,661
GCS of 6T.

265
00:09:18,685 --> 00:09:21,196
We got him back after
multiple rounds of CPR.

266
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,198
He jumped onto a train track
and got electrocuted.

267
00:09:23,222 --> 00:09:25,568
He didn't jump. He fell. We were kissing.

268
00:09:25,592 --> 00:09:27,369
We were saying goodbye,
and we thought that

269
00:09:27,393 --> 00:09:28,871
the train was still behind us.

270
00:09:28,895 --> 00:09:31,373
Then he turned around
too fast, and he just fell.

271
00:09:31,397 --> 00:09:32,708
Oh, my God! Link!

272
00:09:32,732 --> 00:09:34,510
It's the face-eaters from this morning!

273
00:09:34,534 --> 00:09:35,711
All right, okay, we got to go!

274
00:09:35,735 --> 00:09:37,580
- Trauma one!
- Go, go, go!

275
00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:51,013
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

276
00:09:51,739 --> 00:09:53,169
Third-degree burns on this arm.

277
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:55,303
- Head trauma?
- I paged Koracick.

278
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:57,198
And he's busy. What happened?

279
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,366
Brad fell on his guitar,
which fell on the train tracks.

280
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,868
He was making out with his girlfriend.

281
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,236
I don't have a pulse in either wrist,

282
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,409
and this arm is cold and tight.

283
00:10:03,433 --> 00:10:05,439
- This one, too.
- Okay, right leg's okay,

284
00:10:05,463 --> 00:10:07,508
but I'm not getting
anything in the left foot.

285
00:10:07,532 --> 00:10:08,709
- Compartment syndrome.
- Compartment syndrome, okay.

286
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,511
- Okay.
- Scalpels and sterile gloves!

287
00:10:10,535 --> 00:10:11,679
Simms, you ever done a fasciotomy?

288
00:10:11,703 --> 00:10:13,113
Does a cadaver count?

289
00:10:13,137 --> 00:10:14,849
You and Jo take the arms.
I'll take the leg.

290
00:10:16,474 --> 00:10:18,352
Pupils are equal and reactive,

291
00:10:18,376 --> 00:10:19,887
but I can't rule out a head injury.

292
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:21,121
He needs a CT ASAP.

293
00:10:21,145 --> 00:10:22,456
After we save his limbs.

294
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,358
Okay, fasciotomies on my count.

295
00:10:24,382 --> 00:10:25,860
One, two...

296
00:10:25,884 --> 00:10:27,394
Wait, wait! Is that her?

297
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,029
She should not see this.

298
00:10:31,856 --> 00:10:34,802
All right, one, two, three.

299
00:10:43,535 --> 00:10:45,145
Do you care if I stand?

300
00:10:45,169 --> 00:10:47,448
Stand, sit, whatever you need.

301
00:10:47,472 --> 00:10:49,250
I don't need to stand.

302
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,452
I just p-prefer to, I guess.

303
00:10:51,476 --> 00:10:53,087
Okay, whatever's more comfortable.

304
00:10:55,146 --> 00:10:56,457
You don't think that's possible?

305
00:10:56,481 --> 00:10:58,192
To be comfortable here?

306
00:10:58,216 --> 00:11:00,628
I think that when your bosses tell you

307
00:11:00,652 --> 00:11:03,163
that you can't operate
until a counselor signs off,

308
00:11:03,187 --> 00:11:05,165
it sort of casts a mood.

309
00:11:05,189 --> 00:11:07,001
Okay, what kind of mood?

310
00:11:10,862 --> 00:11:14,575
Look, our patients were
at extreme risk, all right?

311
00:11:14,599 --> 00:11:15,576
And I keep coming back to the fact that

312
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,878
if I'd behaved differently,
they'd be dead.

313
00:11:17,902 --> 00:11:19,513
- Mm-hmm.
- And that's all it was...

314
00:11:19,537 --> 00:11:21,849
just passion for the work.
Trying to save lives.

315
00:11:21,873 --> 00:11:24,174
It's not some manic, uh, whatever.

316
00:11:24,198 --> 00:11:25,286
I didn't say "manic."

317
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,221
Are you experiencing symptoms of mania?

318
00:11:27,245 --> 00:11:28,322
No.

319
00:11:28,346 --> 00:11:29,990
Agitation, inflated confidence,

320
00:11:30,014 --> 00:11:32,426
rambling, increased sex drive?

321
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,862
N-No. No, none of that.

322
00:11:34,886 --> 00:11:39,600
I just... I've... had
a very stressful couple weeks.

323
00:11:39,624 --> 00:11:41,201
That's all.

324
00:11:41,225 --> 00:11:42,560
Okay.

325
00:11:44,295 --> 00:11:48,209
"Painter left job unfinished,
spilled paint on porch.

326
00:11:48,372 --> 00:11:50,283
Do not hire this person.

327
00:11:50,308 --> 00:11:53,687
Shrug emoji, poop emoji,
thumbs-down emoji.

328
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:54,890
Zero stars."

329
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:56,225
I'm sure you can have that removed

330
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,961
if you contact customer service.

331
00:11:57,986 --> 00:12:00,532
You sound like someone
who's never tried to do that.

332
00:12:00,557 --> 00:12:02,401
Schmitt, she should've had a CT by now.

333
00:12:02,426 --> 00:12:03,837
And what's the status on her room?

334
00:12:03,862 --> 00:12:05,206
Apparently there's an issue
with admissions.

335
00:12:05,283 --> 00:12:06,560
A lot of people got moved around.

336
00:12:06,584 --> 00:12:07,528
Some VIP thing.

337
00:12:07,552 --> 00:12:09,530
Do I get some kind of
discount for the wait?

338
00:12:09,554 --> 00:12:11,732
I do have her lab results, though.

339
00:12:11,756 --> 00:12:12,967
Oh.

340
00:12:14,726 --> 00:12:17,404
Whoa. Noelle, these
numbers are kinda high.

341
00:12:17,428 --> 00:12:19,573
Are you taking your insulin regularly?

342
00:12:19,597 --> 00:12:20,708
I'm pretty good about it.

343
00:12:20,732 --> 00:12:22,433
"Pretty good"... what does that mean?

344
00:12:23,601 --> 00:12:24,979
We're not gonna judge you.

345
00:12:25,003 --> 00:12:26,914
I just need to know so these
numbers make sense.

346
00:12:26,938 --> 00:12:28,616
Are you taking your insulin?

347
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,251
Okay, the deal is

348
00:12:31,275 --> 00:12:33,487
I just moved my folks
into assisted living,

349
00:12:33,511 --> 00:12:35,289
and that's not cheap.

350
00:12:35,313 --> 00:12:38,559
I've been working all these apps
trying to make ends meet.

351
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:41,662
But there isn't always
enough left over for me.

352
00:12:41,686 --> 00:12:45,799
So, um, I've been rationing my insulin

353
00:12:45,823 --> 00:12:48,202
until my situation's more stable.

354
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:50,070
Unfortunately, that's not how this works.

355
00:12:50,094 --> 00:12:51,772
I'm... I'm sure that's why
you got dizzy and fell.

356
00:12:52,997 --> 00:12:54,608
Dr. Grey, Chief Koracick needs you.

357
00:12:54,632 --> 00:12:55,743
Well, tell him to wait.

358
00:12:55,767 --> 00:12:57,544
He says it's an emergency.

359
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:01,315
Okay, let's get her a CT,
check on the status of her room,

360
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:03,250
page me as soon as she gets in.

361
00:13:03,274 --> 00:13:05,019
- Okay.
- Okay?

362
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,689
Dr. Grey. Thank you for coming.

363
00:13:08,713 --> 00:13:10,024
Why's this floor empty?

364
00:13:10,048 --> 00:13:11,525
You said this was an emergency.

365
00:13:11,549 --> 00:13:13,160
Oh, it is. Emergent, uh, consult.

366
00:13:13,184 --> 00:13:15,396
Griffin Ford is here today.

367
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,563
The billionaire rocket guy?

368
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:19,089
Yeah, maybe don't call him that.

369
00:13:20,194 --> 00:13:21,368
Wait a second. Please don't tell me

370
00:13:21,392 --> 00:13:23,537
you let him buy out this entire floor.

371
00:13:23,561 --> 00:13:24,605
No, of course not. He got it for free.

372
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:27,165
He's a great friend to
the Catherine Fox Foundation.

373
00:13:27,732 --> 00:13:29,677
The emergency room is overflowing!

374
00:13:29,701 --> 00:13:31,445
Patients need rooms.
My patient needs a room.

375
00:13:31,469 --> 00:13:33,380
Well, all... all the more reason
to get this taken care of

376
00:13:33,404 --> 00:13:34,948
and get him on his... on his way.

377
00:13:34,972 --> 00:13:36,650
Th-This guy is about a lot more than,

378
00:13:36,674 --> 00:13:37,818
uh, spaceships, Grey.

379
00:13:37,842 --> 00:13:40,688
He's working to fight
climate change, uh, end poverty.

380
00:13:40,712 --> 00:13:43,724
And... And I'm pretty sure,
uh, he's... he's single.

381
00:13:43,748 --> 00:13:44,758
Okay, not interested.

382
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:48,195
Okay, you don't have to be
nice, but be a pro.

383
00:13:54,992 --> 00:13:59,006
Yes. Yes. Good girl, Emmie.

384
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:03,777
Dr. Mochrie to OR 3.

385
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:04,678
Hey.

386
00:14:04,702 --> 00:14:06,837
Dr. Julia Mochrie to OR 3.

387
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,419
Teddy, what... what was that?

388
00:14:12,443 --> 00:14:13,654
Oh, I... Well, I just, uh...

389
00:14:13,678 --> 00:14:15,656
I just wanted to take the stairs.

390
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,725
Teddy, what's wrong?

391
00:14:17,749 --> 00:14:20,427
I know you too well.
Something has happened.

392
00:14:20,451 --> 00:14:22,319
Just tell me.

393
00:14:29,894 --> 00:14:32,129
Amelia's baby might be yours.

394
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:33,974
I mean

395
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:37,077
Might be, as in might not.

396
00:14:37,101 --> 00:14:37,978
I just...

397
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,488
I don't... I don't think she knows yet.

398
00:14:41,939 --> 00:14:43,317
Jo.

399
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:44,818
What does Jo have to do with anything?

400
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,220
She mentioned something in surgery.

401
00:14:46,244 --> 00:14:48,222
She said, "What would you do if..."

402
00:14:48,246 --> 00:14:49,890
How do you even know this?
Did Amelia tell you or...

403
00:14:49,914 --> 00:14:50,824
- No.
- Then who?

404
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:51,925
It doesn't matter. Te... You just told me

405
00:14:51,949 --> 00:14:54,695
that I-I might have another
baby with another woman.

406
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,629
Amelia, your ex-wife.

407
00:14:55,653 --> 00:14:57,131
I need to make sure that you didn't hear

408
00:14:57,155 --> 00:14:58,886
- some rumor and run with it.
- Run with it?

409
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,073
I want to make sure that it's real.

410
00:15:00,097 --> 00:15:01,317
It's real, Owen!

411
00:15:01,341 --> 00:15:02,770
It's a real baby,

412
00:15:02,794 --> 00:15:04,929
and you might really be the father!

413
00:15:09,967 --> 00:15:11,678
If you have a baby with Amelia,

414
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:14,004
what does that mean for us?

415
00:15:14,806 --> 00:15:16,773
I...

416
00:15:17,475 --> 00:15:19,075
Wow.

417
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:21,588
Wow.

418
00:15:21,612 --> 00:15:23,257
Wow.

419
00:15:23,281 --> 00:15:24,681
Teddy.

420
00:15:30,522 --> 00:15:32,566
I enjoyed your article.

421
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:33,767
Which one?

422
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,435
Uh, "The List."

423
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,946
Exposing all those problems
with the healthcare system.

424
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:41,048
I bet that ruffled
some feathers around here.

425
00:15:41,072 --> 00:15:42,616
We survived.

426
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:46,220
Reasonable people adapt
themselves to the world...

427
00:15:46,244 --> 00:15:48,188
unreasonable people persist

428
00:15:48,212 --> 00:15:50,558
in adapting the world to themselves.

429
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:54,495
Therefore, all progress depends
on unreasonable people.

430
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:56,764
- Huh. Profound.
- Hmm.

431
00:15:56,788 --> 00:15:58,799
The future should ruffle
feathers. Don't you think?

432
00:15:58,823 --> 00:16:01,777
Sometimes your vision demands
that you light the spark,

433
00:16:01,807 --> 00:16:04,405
you storm the palace.

434
00:16:04,429 --> 00:16:06,707
- I've been there.
- Hmm.

435
00:16:06,731 --> 00:16:08,876
You don't agree?

436
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,844
I just find it ironic
that someone who has

437
00:16:10,868 --> 00:16:12,913
a whole hospital floor to themselves

438
00:16:12,937 --> 00:16:14,949
is talking about storming palaces.

439
00:16:14,973 --> 00:16:17,117
I didn't ask for an entire floor.

440
00:16:17,141 --> 00:16:18,018
You didn't have to.

441
00:16:18,042 --> 00:16:19,553
You just asked Catherine Fox for a favor,

442
00:16:19,577 --> 00:16:20,854
and, boom, here you are.

443
00:16:20,878 --> 00:16:23,157
Grey, time to check his thyroid.

444
00:16:25,283 --> 00:16:26,660
Excuse me.

445
00:16:26,684 --> 00:16:28,162
Ooh! Look at that.

446
00:16:28,186 --> 00:16:29,396
My patient's in CT.

447
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,931
Your patient's right here.

448
00:16:30,955 --> 00:16:32,199
He's someone else's patient now.

449
00:16:32,223 --> 00:16:34,335
Mr. Ford, may I introduce you to

450
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:36,537
- Dr. Jackson Avery?
- Grey.

451
00:16:36,561 --> 00:16:38,606
We're rolling out
the red carpet for Mr. Ford,

452
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:42,109
and it doesn't get any redder
than Dr. Avery.

453
00:16:42,133 --> 00:16:43,744
Wh... What's going on?

454
00:16:43,768 --> 00:16:46,203
Your mom, your mess.

455
00:16:49,273 --> 00:16:50,884
Brad's electrocution injury

456
00:16:50,908 --> 00:16:52,019
affected the tissue in his limbs.

457
00:16:52,043 --> 00:16:55,255
We had to cut through
both of his arms and his leg

458
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,157
to preserve the circulation.

459
00:16:57,181 --> 00:16:59,259
Still, the damage was extensive.

460
00:16:59,283 --> 00:17:02,129
His head CT shows a small
epidural bleed in his brain,

461
00:17:02,153 --> 00:17:03,697
which I'll evacuate in the OR.

462
00:17:03,721 --> 00:17:05,499
It could have been a lot worse.

463
00:17:05,523 --> 00:17:06,867
We think that the neck of his guitar

464
00:17:06,891 --> 00:17:08,039
took most of the impact.

465
00:17:08,063 --> 00:17:09,403
It probably saved his life.

466
00:17:09,427 --> 00:17:11,705
Wow.

467
00:17:11,729 --> 00:17:13,440
One second, he was there,

468
00:17:13,464 --> 00:17:17,077
and then he just disappeared
like he fell through a trapdoor.

469
00:17:17,101 --> 00:17:19,647
You didn't hear the train leaving?

470
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:22,216
We... We just graduated from U-Dub,

471
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,320
and Brad got this internship
at a music studio here.

472
00:17:26,344 --> 00:17:30,391
But I won a Rhodes Scholarship,
and he's been so sweet,

473
00:17:30,415 --> 00:17:33,360
singing me these corny love songs.

474
00:17:33,384 --> 00:17:35,229
But it's been torture just knowing that

475
00:17:35,253 --> 00:17:36,730
we were gonna be apart.

476
00:17:36,754 --> 00:17:38,699
And I was on my way to the airport today,

477
00:17:38,723 --> 00:17:41,168
and he just got this look on his face

478
00:17:41,192 --> 00:17:45,172
and... and he said, "Screw it.
Let's go to England together."

479
00:17:45,196 --> 00:17:47,341
And then he kissed me, and it was like...

480
00:17:47,365 --> 00:17:49,266
everything was solved.

481
00:17:50,234 --> 00:17:53,714
Not even the "ding-ding"
of the doors closing?

482
00:17:53,738 --> 00:17:55,916
The annoying loudspeaker?

483
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,752
Okay, uh, we are gonna
take Brad to the OR

484
00:17:58,776 --> 00:18:00,719
and then move him to the ICU.

485
00:18:00,743 --> 00:18:02,322
We will let you know
if we have any updates.

486
00:18:02,346 --> 00:18:04,481
Okay.

487
00:18:07,518 --> 00:18:08,961
What are you doing here?

488
00:18:08,986 --> 00:18:10,998
I wasn't sure if you could leave,
so I paged everyone.

489
00:18:11,022 --> 00:18:13,680
There's a guy up there with
the entire floor to himself.

490
00:18:13,704 --> 00:18:15,916
Meanwhile, this woman
is rationing her insulin

491
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,050
just to stay alive.

492
00:18:17,074 --> 00:18:18,051
It's infuriating.

493
00:18:19,443 --> 00:18:21,188
Oh. Scans are up.

494
00:18:21,212 --> 00:18:22,856
Big retroperitoneal bleed.

495
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,424
Kidney's shattered. She needs an ex-lap.

496
00:18:24,448 --> 00:18:25,992
Let's book the OR.

497
00:18:26,016 --> 00:18:28,095
And if any billionaire
tries to get in your way,

498
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:30,186
push them aside.

499
00:18:32,423 --> 00:18:33,667
Are you okay?

500
00:18:33,692 --> 00:18:35,436
Huh? Uh...

501
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:36,670
Have you talked to Amelia?

502
00:18:36,694 --> 00:18:37,637
About...?

503
00:18:37,661 --> 00:18:39,005
Help! I need help!

504
00:18:41,932 --> 00:18:42,943
BP's dropping.

505
00:18:42,967 --> 00:18:44,244
Abdomen's more distended.

506
00:18:44,268 --> 00:18:45,612
Let's get an intubation tray.

507
00:18:45,636 --> 00:18:47,403
Book the OR.

508
00:18:49,807 --> 00:18:51,952
Hey, I got your page. What's wrong?

509
00:18:51,976 --> 00:18:55,545
Let's talk in your office.

510
00:19:01,619 --> 00:19:02,852
Ta-da!

511
00:19:03,554 --> 00:19:05,565
What the hell did you do?

512
00:19:05,589 --> 00:19:08,335
What? I had the movers
bring up your old furniture

513
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:10,704
from the basement and arrange
it like it was before.

514
00:19:10,728 --> 00:19:12,608
Look, I-I know

515
00:19:12,632 --> 00:19:14,199
you're still feeling down

516
00:19:14,223 --> 00:19:16,576
about Catherine and everything else.

517
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,669
So o-of course you didn't
want that Pac-North stuff.

518
00:19:20,758 --> 00:19:24,438
You think you know what
I want and what I don't want?

519
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,141
I never wanted
this furniture moved in here

520
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,643
in the first place!

521
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:28,989
And it came anyway!

522
00:19:29,013 --> 00:19:30,690
And if I had wanted this old junk back,

523
00:19:30,714 --> 00:19:31,958
I would have asked for it!

524
00:19:31,982 --> 00:19:34,628
Look, I want an empty room!

525
00:19:34,652 --> 00:19:36,653
Why is that so hard to understand?!

526
00:19:38,148 --> 00:19:39,826
You know, you're just like her.

527
00:19:39,851 --> 00:19:41,762
You presume to know what's best!

528
00:19:41,787 --> 00:19:43,731
Okay! Okay.

529
00:19:43,756 --> 00:19:45,634
It's an easy fix. Ri... I d...

530
00:19:45,659 --> 00:19:48,205
I'll just call
building services and right...

531
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,574
Ah.

532
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:50,742
Okay, apparently,

533
00:19:50,767 --> 00:19:53,413
Tom Koracick has decided to
wreak havoc on the hospital.

534
00:19:53,438 --> 00:19:56,517
Look, I-I'll come back, and I'll fix it.

535
00:19:56,542 --> 00:19:59,121
Don't bother! I'll do it myself!

536
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,326
Hey, I texted. You didn't reply.

537
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,829
Uh, yeah, I got stuck helping
babysit a billionaire.

538
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,636
It screwed up my entire schedule.

539
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,504
You should go enjoy your day off, though.

540
00:20:23,528 --> 00:20:25,406
You know, I can swing by the boat later.

541
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:28,343
Maybe I can bring a housewarming
present for you and Dean.

542
00:20:28,367 --> 00:20:30,634
Jackson. Jackson, hey.

543
00:20:31,636 --> 00:20:32,947
What's up?

544
00:20:32,971 --> 00:20:34,315
I move in, you're mad, and I move out,

545
00:20:34,339 --> 00:20:35,383
and you're still mad.

546
00:20:35,407 --> 00:20:37,585
So, what... If you have
a problem, just tell me.

547
00:20:40,011 --> 00:20:41,089
Please.

548
00:20:41,113 --> 00:20:42,646
Okay.

549
00:20:45,517 --> 00:20:48,863
Look, I know you and Dean are friends.

550
00:20:48,887 --> 00:20:49,864
- Okay, I get that.
- Mm-hmm.

551
00:20:49,888 --> 00:20:51,599
I also think he has
a thing for you, so...

552
00:20:51,623 --> 00:20:52,633
What? No, he doesn't.
He doesn't have a...

553
00:20:52,657 --> 00:20:54,669
He also hit on Maggie
when we were together,

554
00:20:54,693 --> 00:20:56,204
so I kind of question his whole...

555
00:20:56,228 --> 00:20:58,039
Oh, you don't need to question anything.

556
00:20:58,063 --> 00:20:59,474
He didn't know she had a boyfriend,

557
00:20:59,498 --> 00:21:00,475
and when he did, he backed off.

558
00:21:00,499 --> 00:21:02,343
And then he invited you to live with him.

559
00:21:02,367 --> 00:21:03,611
No, no, he did not...

560
00:21:03,635 --> 00:21:04,779
He did not invite me. I asked.

561
00:21:04,803 --> 00:21:06,457
Which somehow makes it worse, okay?

562
00:21:06,481 --> 00:21:08,153
- It...
- Not... You live with him now.

563
00:21:08,177 --> 00:21:10,323
You're raising a baby
together, all right?

564
00:21:10,347 --> 00:21:11,524
You haven't even met my child.

565
00:21:11,548 --> 00:21:12,725
You haven't invited me to meet her.

566
00:21:12,749 --> 00:21:13,993
'Cause we're not there yet!

567
00:21:14,017 --> 00:21:15,661
Then where are we?!
Because it sounds like

568
00:21:15,685 --> 00:21:17,430
we're in the place where you freak out

569
00:21:17,454 --> 00:21:19,198
when I get too close
and when I live my life.

570
00:21:19,222 --> 00:21:20,393
So pick a lane.

571
00:21:20,417 --> 00:21:21,534
Look, I don't want to fight with you.

572
00:21:21,558 --> 00:21:23,002
- Well, I do!
- I'm at work.

573
00:21:23,026 --> 00:21:24,537
I have a VIP patient to deal with.

574
00:21:24,561 --> 00:21:25,638
So I'd like us...

575
00:21:25,662 --> 00:21:28,040
...to be able to talk about this
completely later.

576
00:21:28,064 --> 00:21:29,475
You know, I'm sorry. If you can't answer

577
00:21:29,499 --> 00:21:31,077
the simple question of where we are,

578
00:21:31,101 --> 00:21:33,045
I'm not sure we have
that much left to talk about.

579
00:21:33,069 --> 00:21:34,113
Oh, you know what? Come on, okay?

580
00:21:34,137 --> 00:21:35,982
You don't get to suddenly
dictate the timeline.

581
00:21:36,006 --> 00:21:38,484
You made choices that
I was not involved in.

582
00:21:38,508 --> 00:21:39,986
Give me a second to process.

583
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:42,188
Process what? That I have friends?

584
00:21:42,212 --> 00:21:44,156
Okay, all right, yeah.
You have your process.

585
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,359
Let me know how it goes.

586
00:21:47,651 --> 00:21:49,695
We'll need to page Avery post-op

587
00:21:49,719 --> 00:21:51,731
to take a look at these wounds
for closure later.

588
00:21:51,755 --> 00:21:52,965
Hematoma drained.

589
00:21:52,989 --> 00:21:54,500
He's lucky that guitar didn't jam

590
00:21:54,524 --> 00:21:55,668
straight into his brain.

591
00:21:55,692 --> 00:21:57,100
It was a cheap guitar.

592
00:21:57,124 --> 00:21:59,272
So much for dumb love songs.

593
00:21:59,296 --> 00:22:01,574
What is wrong with making out in public

594
00:22:01,598 --> 00:22:04,343
and singing to each other
un-ironically, saying,

595
00:22:04,367 --> 00:22:05,344
"Screw it... let's go have an adventure"?

596
00:22:05,368 --> 00:22:07,546
Isn't that what being 22
and in love is for?

597
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:10,950
Yeah, until the part where
you get cooked on a train track.

598
00:22:10,974 --> 00:22:12,618
Word.

599
00:22:12,642 --> 00:22:14,120
Hmm. I'm done here.

600
00:22:14,144 --> 00:22:16,407
Do you two need help
dressing those wounds?

601
00:22:16,431 --> 00:22:17,523
No, I think we got it from here.

602
00:22:17,547 --> 00:22:19,458
Yeah, and we're good
to update the girlfriend

603
00:22:19,482 --> 00:22:21,627
if you have somewhere you need to be.

604
00:22:26,556 --> 00:22:28,501
"Word"? Really?

605
00:22:28,525 --> 00:22:30,169
I know.

606
00:22:30,193 --> 00:22:31,237
I'll be right with you guys, okay?

607
00:22:31,261 --> 00:22:33,739
Hey, Chief! Uh, I think
I got the overflow handled.

608
00:22:33,763 --> 00:22:34,674
So...

609
00:22:34,698 --> 00:22:36,642
DeLuca, telling me you're doing your job

610
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:37,777
isn't a part of doing your job.

611
00:22:37,801 --> 00:22:39,512
Right, but I just thought now
that that's taken care of,

612
00:22:39,536 --> 00:22:41,080
I could maybe start
treating some of the patients

613
00:22:41,104 --> 00:22:42,748
- that I've been moving?
- Oh, that isn't our deal.

614
00:22:42,772 --> 00:22:44,583
Look, I've been seeing
the counselor, all right?

615
00:22:44,607 --> 00:22:45,818
I did that. And now with Dr. Webber

616
00:22:45,842 --> 00:22:48,754
handing off his entire service,
I just thought I could help.

617
00:22:48,778 --> 00:22:51,157
Webber handed off his entire service?

618
00:22:51,181 --> 00:22:52,466
- Why?
- You know what?

619
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:54,427
I don't really know because
gossip isn't a part of my job.

620
00:22:54,451 --> 00:22:56,495
I'm a surgeon.
Please, Chief, let me work.

621
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:57,530
This... This...

622
00:22:57,554 --> 00:22:58,497
Chief? Is that a yes?

623
00:22:58,521 --> 00:23:00,333
It is not.

624
00:23:04,661 --> 00:23:06,238
I can't find the bleeding. She's in DIC.

625
00:23:06,262 --> 00:23:07,473
Can we control it with a REBOA?

626
00:23:07,497 --> 00:23:08,499
She's lost too much blood.

627
00:23:08,523 --> 00:23:10,109
She couldn't afford her insulin.

628
00:23:10,133 --> 00:23:11,077
She was healthy.

629
00:23:11,101 --> 00:23:12,645
She was doing everything
she needed to do.

630
00:23:12,669 --> 00:23:13,946
She was taking care of her parents.

631
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:15,514
She had her whole life ahead of her.

632
00:23:15,538 --> 00:23:17,323
This shouldn't have happened!

633
00:23:20,543 --> 00:23:22,688
Dr. Crone to Peds ICU.

634
00:23:22,712 --> 00:23:25,024
Dr. Alexandria Crone to Peds ICU.

635
00:23:25,048 --> 00:23:26,482
Hey.

636
00:23:27,784 --> 00:23:29,391
I told Owen.

637
00:23:30,253 --> 00:23:33,299
Okay, did he... Should someone warn Tom?

638
00:23:33,323 --> 00:23:35,534
No, not about that.

639
00:23:35,558 --> 00:23:37,703
About the baby, about Amelia's baby.

640
00:23:37,727 --> 00:23:39,338
I told him because she wouldn't

641
00:23:39,362 --> 00:23:40,406
and he deserves to know,

642
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:44,009
and I deserve answers,
and Link deserves answers,

643
00:23:44,033 --> 00:23:45,978
and, I mean, who does this?

644
00:23:46,002 --> 00:23:47,546
Who gets this far into the pregnancy

645
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,048
and just toys with people's feelings,

646
00:23:49,072 --> 00:23:50,449
with... with their lives?

647
00:23:50,473 --> 00:23:52,084
I was just starting to really like her.

648
00:23:52,108 --> 00:23:55,788
And I was just starting
to really like you.

649
00:23:55,812 --> 00:23:56,922
I mean, who does this?

650
00:23:56,946 --> 00:23:58,057
Who cheats on her fiancé

651
00:23:58,081 --> 00:24:00,860
with a man who is clearly
desperately in love with her?

652
00:24:00,884 --> 00:24:02,027
And before you go judging Amelia,

653
00:24:02,051 --> 00:24:04,997
let's just take a second
to remember how long you waited

654
00:24:05,021 --> 00:24:07,423
before you told Owen
that you were pregnant.

655
00:24:09,058 --> 00:24:10,236
You're right. You're right.

656
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,704
I'm... I'm sorry.

657
00:24:11,728 --> 00:24:12,796
Yeah.

658
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:15,508
That's my sister you're talking about.

659
00:24:19,235 --> 00:24:21,614
Yeah, aside from low Vitamin D levels

660
00:24:21,638 --> 00:24:23,749
and some ligament wear and tear
in your C-spine,

661
00:24:23,773 --> 00:24:24,950
you're the picture of health.

662
00:24:24,974 --> 00:24:28,554
When we have bad outcomes,
we tend to blame the conditions,

663
00:24:28,578 --> 00:24:30,389
but sometimes, it's just human error.

664
00:24:30,413 --> 00:24:33,649
And we need to take the hit and move on.

665
00:24:40,657 --> 00:24:42,268
You know, ironically, I'm getting that,

666
00:24:42,292 --> 00:24:43,702
"You are the picture of health,"

667
00:24:43,726 --> 00:24:46,772
is not the news you were hoping to hear.

668
00:24:46,796 --> 00:24:48,207
You don't think there's a chance

669
00:24:48,231 --> 00:24:50,109
that one of your team made an error?

670
00:24:50,133 --> 00:24:54,213
More specifically,
um, that you made an error?

671
00:24:54,237 --> 00:24:59,618
I've read about rare conditions...

672
00:24:59,642 --> 00:25:02,221
a tiny bubble in an artery,

673
00:25:02,245 --> 00:25:04,390
a blip that most doctors would miss.

674
00:25:04,414 --> 00:25:06,892
I mean, if you were to find
something like that,

675
00:25:06,916 --> 00:25:08,627
it would explain everything.

676
00:25:11,754 --> 00:25:13,833
The world is falling apart, Tom,

677
00:25:13,857 --> 00:25:16,669
and people act like, "Well,
somebody's gonna save us."

678
00:25:16,693 --> 00:25:18,737
But I don't see that person.

679
00:25:18,761 --> 00:25:20,806
And I sure as hell can't be that person

680
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:23,142
from a jail cell.

681
00:25:23,166 --> 00:25:25,911
Just think of all the good you could do

682
00:25:25,935 --> 00:25:29,248
with my resources, my cash.

683
00:25:29,272 --> 00:25:31,750
You could research anything you wanted.

684
00:25:31,774 --> 00:25:33,319
You'd be a legend.

685
00:25:33,343 --> 00:25:36,055
And if anyone ever
caught you, you'd just say,

686
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:38,991
"Uh, oops, I misread his scan.

687
00:25:39,015 --> 00:25:41,727
Human error."

688
00:25:41,751 --> 00:25:43,829
Take another look at the scans,

689
00:25:43,853 --> 00:25:46,866
just in case there's
something you missed.

690
00:26:01,836 --> 00:26:04,481
Okay, Tom, my patient just died.

691
00:26:04,505 --> 00:26:06,616
So if your billionaire needs a lollipop

692
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,552
or a foot massage,
please go to someone else.

693
00:26:08,576 --> 00:26:09,653
If you had his kind of money,

694
00:26:09,677 --> 00:26:11,444
what would you do with it?

695
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,391
Wh...

696
00:26:14,415 --> 00:26:16,058
I don't know.

697
00:26:16,517 --> 00:26:18,395
I'd triple the size of the clinic.

698
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:20,530
I'd make half our cases pro bono.

699
00:26:20,554 --> 00:26:22,032
I could develop a research lab

700
00:26:22,056 --> 00:26:23,333
and come up with our own medicine

701
00:26:23,357 --> 00:26:25,202
so we could cut out
big pharma completely.

702
00:26:25,226 --> 00:26:26,503
Public healthcare initiatives.

703
00:26:26,527 --> 00:26:27,704
We could put a stop to food deserts.

704
00:26:27,728 --> 00:26:30,640
We could get healthcare
and nutrition to the homeless.

705
00:26:30,664 --> 00:26:31,875
The point is you'd do good, lots of it,

706
00:26:31,899 --> 00:26:34,511
because this world
never runs out of people

707
00:26:34,535 --> 00:26:36,236
who need help.

708
00:26:38,038 --> 00:26:40,249
How do you decide which rules to break?

709
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:42,519
How do I decide?

710
00:26:42,543 --> 00:26:45,188
We're surgeons. We live by
rules, precedents, protocols.

711
00:26:45,212 --> 00:26:47,657
I mean, annoying as they are,
they reproduce success,

712
00:26:47,681 --> 00:26:51,561
so, Meredith Grey,
award-winning rule breaker,

713
00:26:51,585 --> 00:26:54,664
how do you decide which rules to break?

714
00:26:54,688 --> 00:26:56,566
I-I just go with my gut.

715
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,201
And I hope that whatever I'm doing

716
00:26:58,225 --> 00:27:02,205
improves this mess of a world
just a little bit.

717
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:12,349
We believe he's out of immediate danger,

718
00:27:12,373 --> 00:27:15,367
but there's no question
he's gonna have a long recovery.

719
00:27:16,143 --> 00:27:18,722
Does he have family nearby?

720
00:27:18,746 --> 00:27:21,057
Yeah, um, I called.

721
00:27:21,081 --> 00:27:22,692
They're on the way.

722
00:27:22,716 --> 00:27:24,728
He'll also need additional surgeries

723
00:27:24,752 --> 00:27:26,763
to treat the burns and close the wounds

724
00:27:26,787 --> 00:27:28,464
on his arms and leg.

725
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:31,067
Right.

726
00:27:31,091 --> 00:27:32,801
So...

727
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:35,695
England...

728
00:27:38,666 --> 00:27:41,811
Um whoever takes care of Brad

729
00:27:41,835 --> 00:27:44,714
needs to be prepared to spend
a lot of time in hospitals

730
00:27:44,738 --> 00:27:46,231
for a while.

731
00:27:46,774 --> 00:27:48,551
I can't... I can't do that. I can't stay.

732
00:27:48,575 --> 00:27:49,753
You don't have to make
that decision right now.

733
00:27:49,777 --> 00:27:51,488
No, but I already decided.

734
00:27:51,512 --> 00:27:53,256
And... And he decided to come with me,

735
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,725
but I was always gonna go,
with or without him.

736
00:27:57,718 --> 00:28:00,080
What does it mean if
he would leave his dream for me,

737
00:28:00,104 --> 00:28:03,723
but I... I won't stay for him?

738
00:28:14,468 --> 00:28:16,446
Wow.

739
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:19,605
That went from forever to over
in less than a day.

740
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:22,919
You called it, Jo.

741
00:28:22,943 --> 00:28:26,612
All love sucks eventually.

742
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:30,442
No.

743
00:28:31,285 --> 00:28:33,830
It doesn't suck.

744
00:28:33,854 --> 00:28:37,968
I've spent all week trying to hate Alex,

745
00:28:37,992 --> 00:28:39,826
and nothing works.

746
00:28:40,694 --> 00:28:42,605
Because every time I get into my car,

747
00:28:42,629 --> 00:28:44,307
I see this little trash bag

748
00:28:44,331 --> 00:28:45,542
that he put in my side pocket

749
00:28:45,566 --> 00:28:49,279
so that I had somewhere to put
my gum wrappers and tissues.

750
00:28:49,303 --> 00:28:52,716
And I felt... I felt so loved

751
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,217
that he did that.

752
00:28:55,909 --> 00:28:59,789
And now he put me in the trash

753
00:28:59,813 --> 00:29:02,048
with the gum wrappers and the tissues.

754
00:29:03,751 --> 00:29:06,352
I'm so mad.

755
00:29:08,689 --> 00:29:10,440
I'm so hurt.

756
00:29:11,698 --> 00:29:14,010
But I also know that he is the reason

757
00:29:14,035 --> 00:29:15,679
that I will get up again.

758
00:29:15,829 --> 00:29:17,507
I will climb out of the trash,

759
00:29:17,531 --> 00:29:19,565
and I will rise.

760
00:29:21,668 --> 00:29:23,279
I'll rise so high

761
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,782
that I'll make him a fool
for ever having left me,

762
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:27,584
and I'll do it

763
00:29:27,608 --> 00:29:29,668
because of how well he loved me.

764
00:29:30,744 --> 00:29:33,714
I am changed because of him.

765
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:37,761
He helped me feel worthy of love,

766
00:29:37,785 --> 00:29:41,847
and even though it's over,

767
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:46,736
that is mine to keep.

768
00:29:50,898 --> 00:29:53,743
Link, don't blow it with Amelia.

769
00:29:53,767 --> 00:29:55,745
I didn't do anything.

770
00:29:55,769 --> 00:29:57,881
She pushed me away. She ended it.

771
00:29:57,905 --> 00:30:00,350
She didn't push you away.
She gave you a choice.

772
00:30:01,875 --> 00:30:03,620
I never had that.

773
00:30:18,959 --> 00:30:22,405

I'm sorry.

00:30:40,447 --> 00:30:41,825
I know you were just trying to be kind,

780
00:30:41,849 --> 00:30:43,059
and I was wrong to

781
00:30:43,083 --> 00:30:44,794
treat you that way.

00:36:23,252 --> 00:36:24,296
I was happy.

887
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,498
Owen and I finally
found our way back to each other

888
00:36:26,522 --> 00:36:28,466
after years of bad timing.

889
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:29,868
We finally worked.

890
00:36:29,892 --> 00:36:31,603
You know, I-I really
don't think I'm in the mood

891
00:36:31,627 --> 00:36:34,606
to hear how you and Hunt are working.

892
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,386
And then I felt... I...

893
00:36:37,266 --> 00:36:41,313
I feel that he might
choose another woman again,

894
00:36:41,337 --> 00:36:43,715
and I have been through...

895
00:36:43,739 --> 00:36:46,251
with my whole body,

896
00:36:46,275 --> 00:36:50,525
I'm remembering unimaginable loss

897
00:36:51,113 --> 00:36:53,458
and unbearable pain, and you...

898
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:55,760
You make me laugh.

899
00:36:55,784 --> 00:36:57,729
You make me feel good.

900
00:36:57,753 --> 00:36:59,397
You make me feel like

901
00:36:59,421 --> 00:37:02,734
my life isn't completely
spinning out of control.

902
00:37:02,758 --> 00:37:06,938
And... And I-I hate that that hurts you

903
00:37:06,962 --> 00:37:08,406
because you're such a good guy.

904
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,842
Stop. St... Stop saying that.

905
00:37:10,866 --> 00:37:12,911
I'm really not a good guy, Teddy.

906
00:37:12,935 --> 00:37:15,169
I don't think that's true.

907
00:37:19,475 --> 00:37:21,442
It is true.

908
00:37:45,401 --> 00:37:48,314
Hey, you look like
you could use one of these, huh?

909
00:37:48,338 --> 00:37:49,506
Cheers.

910
00:37:52,508 --> 00:37:54,185
So, Alex. Crazy, right?

911
00:37:55,344 --> 00:37:56,288
Sorry about that.

912
00:37:56,312 --> 00:37:58,757
But on the plus side,
we are both free now.

913
00:37:58,781 --> 00:38:01,259
So we could, uh, make the best
out of a bad situation,

914
00:38:01,283 --> 00:38:02,427
take away each other's pain.

915
00:38:02,451 --> 00:38:04,129
I mean, come on, you're beautiful.

916
00:38:04,153 --> 00:38:05,230
You're brilliant. And where is he?

917
00:38:05,254 --> 00:38:06,431
Nowhere. He doesn't respect you.

918
00:38:06,455 --> 00:38:08,033
Do you think Meredith
respects me? Please.

919
00:38:08,057 --> 00:38:09,634
I think he's
a complete idiot if you ask...

920
00:38:11,527 --> 00:38:13,772
You're not okay. You're not yourself.

921
00:38:13,796 --> 00:38:16,541
Listen to people when they tell you that.

922
00:38:16,565 --> 00:38:18,843
Get help before it's too late.

923
00:38:23,806 --> 00:38:25,383
You would think weightlessness

924
00:38:25,407 --> 00:38:28,420
is a good thing, but it's not.

925
00:38:28,444 --> 00:38:30,155
Because people weren't meant to float.

926
00:38:30,179 --> 00:38:32,090
Hey.

927
00:38:32,114 --> 00:38:33,158
Hey.

928
00:38:33,182 --> 00:38:35,527
The kids are down,
and I thought you'd be starving,

929
00:38:35,551 --> 00:38:37,529
so I roasted a chicken, and, yes,

930
00:38:37,553 --> 00:38:40,999
I put a whole stick of butter
into the potatoes.

931
00:38:41,023 --> 00:38:42,500
My favorite.

932
00:38:42,524 --> 00:38:44,469
I know.

933
00:38:44,493 --> 00:38:46,338
Owen, this is, um...

934
00:38:46,362 --> 00:38:48,329
Wait, wait. Me first.

935
00:38:50,032 --> 00:38:52,510
You didn't do anything wrong, okay?

936
00:38:52,534 --> 00:38:54,074
All you did was tell me the truth.

937
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:56,014
I was shocked, and I froze.

938
00:38:56,038 --> 00:38:58,616
But for our future, Teddy,

939
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:03,088
I need you to know you are not
a replacement for anyone.

940
00:39:03,112 --> 00:39:05,457
And if you need to tell me anything,

941
00:39:05,481 --> 00:39:07,459
my answer will be, "I love you."

942
00:39:08,751 --> 00:39:12,083
I love you, and we're
gonna figure it out.

943
00:39:14,386 --> 00:39:16,234
And that's my answer now.

944
00:39:16,258 --> 00:39:17,902
That's my answer tomorrow.

945
00:39:19,795 --> 00:39:21,606
That's my answer always.

946
00:39:23,565 --> 00:39:25,443
And I'm sorry.

947
00:39:25,467 --> 00:39:27,979
Without gravity, we lose blood volume,

948
00:39:28,003 --> 00:39:30,281
bone density, muscle.

949
00:39:32,007 --> 00:39:33,718
Without it, we're untethered.

950
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:57,087
- Oh, hey.
- What are you doing?

951
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,779
I wanted to write you a song,

952
00:40:00,803 --> 00:40:03,448
but I can't write songs,

953
00:40:03,472 --> 00:40:06,584
uh, as fast as I needed to come here

954
00:40:06,608 --> 00:40:09,721
and, um, tell you...

955
00:40:09,745 --> 00:40:13,391
I don't want to live without you.

956
00:40:15,651 --> 00:40:17,629
You seemed pretty clear
about how you felt

957
00:40:17,653 --> 00:40:19,631
if the baby isn't yours.

958
00:40:19,655 --> 00:40:21,166
I was hurting. I was in pain.

959
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:24,202
But that doesn't mean I don't love you,

960
00:40:24,226 --> 00:40:26,224
Amelia, because I do.

961
00:40:26,248 --> 00:40:27,572
Doesn't mean I don't want you.

962
00:40:27,596 --> 00:40:30,275
Because I do... I want you.

963
00:40:30,299 --> 00:40:32,010
You're the only person

964
00:40:32,034 --> 00:40:33,711
that makes me feel all the things

965
00:40:33,735 --> 00:40:38,483
that I thought I was too smart
or too damaged to feel.

966
00:40:38,507 --> 00:40:40,786
You make me want to write
love songs in the rain!

967
00:40:42,111 --> 00:40:43,655
You make me want to be a parent.

968
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:45,523
And I don't... I don't
give a crap whose baby it is.

969
00:40:45,547 --> 00:40:49,727
I don't want to feel
this sad and this lonely,

970
00:40:49,751 --> 00:40:51,463
not if I don't have to.

971
00:40:51,487 --> 00:40:53,431
I fell in love with you, Amelia,

972
00:40:53,455 --> 00:40:54,999
and I fell in love with this baby,

973
00:40:55,023 --> 00:40:57,602
and that is what matters to me.

974
00:40:57,626 --> 00:41:00,505
So when you feel yourself
being pulled toward something,

975
00:41:00,529 --> 00:41:02,674
it's not necessarily a bad thing.

976
00:41:02,698 --> 00:41:04,342
So, you want to do this?

977
00:41:05,901 --> 00:41:08,246
Even if he isn't yours?

978
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:09,514
I do.

979
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:21,025
I really needed to hear that.

980
00:41:21,049 --> 00:41:22,861
Because I got the results.

981
00:41:25,621 --> 00:41:29,400
- And he is yours.
- It may keep you centered.

982
00:41:32,194 --> 00:41:34,220
But you still got to write me that song.

983
00:41:34,245 --> 00:41:35,573
It may keep you safe.
