1
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,060
You've been

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,060
helping me do my job better

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,060
since you got here.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,410
I couldn't help it.

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,410
No need to help it.

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,310
I'm the fart

7
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,310
doctor now. A punchline.

8
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,640
What happened today

9
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,640
was a result of

10
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,640
a medical ailment, okay?

11
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,240
Like anyone's

12
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,240
gonna care about that.

13
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,180
Jack wants to convert Med

14
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,180
into a for-profit hospital.

15
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,120
He wants to put it

16
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,120
to a board vote.

17
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,350
If Jack succeeds,

18
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,350
there goes Med as we know it.

19
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,650
I'm officially

20
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,650
in end-stage

21
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,650
renal disease.

22
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,990
Sean would be your best

23
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,990
possible donor match.

24
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,190
No, that's not an option.

25
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,390
Your dad, his health

26
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,390
is getting worse.

27
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,440
He can't know that

28
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,440
you learned this from me.

29
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,010
Hey.

30
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,340
Hey!

31
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,340
Hey.

32
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,080
What are you doing here?

33
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,080
I was in the neighborhood.

34
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,520
Yeah?

35
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,520
Thought I'd swing by.

36
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,750
All right. Come in.

37
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,750
You hungry?

38
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,280
Got some oatmeal.

39
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,020
Oh, no, I'm good. Thanks.

40
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,690
Got your scrubs on.

41
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,530
Going to work?

42
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,220
It's Wednesday.

43
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,690
What's going on?

44
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,170
Why are you really here?

45
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:20,670
Can I have a word

46
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:20,670
with you, please?

47
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,540
Yeah, you look like

48
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,540
a man on a mission.

49
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,640
What's going on?

50
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,640
Sean stopped by this morning

51
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,650
to offer me

52
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,650
one of his kidneys.

53
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,720
Whoa, that's...

54
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,720
That's an incredibly

55
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,720
generous gift.

56
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,750
Yeah, he just decided

57
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,750
to do it out of the blue,

58
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,750
for some reason.

59
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,690
I just felt like Sean

60
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,690
needed to know how bad

61
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,690
you're actually doing.

62
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,560
Why, because

63
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,560
he's a blood relative,

64
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,290
and so he might have a shot

65
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,290
at being a match for me?

66
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,300
You put him up to this.

67
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,700
Offering you a kidney was all

68
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,700
Sean's idea.

69
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,530
He has not thought

70
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,530
this through, Hannah!

71
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,630
He has thought through

72
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,630
what it'll be like

73
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,630
to lose his father.

74
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,570
He doesn't know

75
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,570
what it means

76
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,570
to give up a kidney,

77
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,830
and I'm not gonna

78
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,830
let him find out, either!

79
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,370
Dr. Archer?

80
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,370
What?

81
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,410
I'm sorry, you have a patient

82
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,410
waiting in trauma 2.

83
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,840
Be right there.

84
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,420
You went to Sean,

85
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,420
against my wishes.

86
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,680
I wanted to help you.

87
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,310
You wanna help me, eh?

88
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,550
How about

89
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,550
stay out of my life?

90
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:15,390
I've been really tired

91
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:15,390
these past few days,

92
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,260
and I can tell

93
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,260
something's wrong.

94
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:22,500
Two years ago,

95
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:22,500
I was diagnosed with

96
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:22,500
myelodysplastic

97
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,160
neoplasm, unclassifiable.

98
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,300
That's a stem cell disease,

99
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,300
if I'm not mistaken.

100
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,710
Incredibly rare.

101
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:32,440
And always with

102
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:32,440
the threat of turning

103
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,680
into leukemia,

104
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,680
unfortunately.

105
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:39,680
Kira, show Dr. Archer

106
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:39,680
the folder.

107
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,260
Sorry, I must have

108
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,260
left it in the car.

109
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,390
Kira, I reminded you

110
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,390
three times.

111
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,630
That's all right, Kimberly.

112
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,200
I've got plenty to work

113
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,200
off of here in your chart.

114
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,760
It says here you've

115
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,760
been on steroids since

116
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,760
your diagnosis.

117
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,340
That's all I can do

118
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,340
to fight the disease.

119
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,770
For now.

120
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,640
Unless a stem cell donor

121
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,640
comes to the rescue.

122
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,240
But I haven't had

123
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,240
much luck with that.

124
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:08,220
I'm a hard match.

125
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,580
Kira?

126
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,550
Kira!

127
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,550
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

128
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,680
Let me get her

129
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,680
in another room.

130
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,920
It's official.

131
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,720
My new house opened escrow.

132
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,570
I feel jittery.

133
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,370
Well, I mean,

134
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,370
I'd be worried

135
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,370
if you didn't.

136
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,770
It's a big deal.

137
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,740
And cause for celebration.

138
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,740
I'm taking you out tonight.

139
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,400
Any restaurant you want.

140
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,400
Any restaurant.

141
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,210
My apartment.

142
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,210
Oh.

143
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,840
I'm making golumpki.

144
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,180
Don't ask.

145
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,580
You will love it.

146
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,620
Oh, and my brother's

147
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,620
coming, too...

148
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,950
Pavel.

149
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,920
I was wanting you

150
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,920
to meet him.

151
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,210
Pavel?

152
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,210
Mm-hmm.

153
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,920
Golumpki? I'm in.

154
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,890
Okay.

155
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,890
8:00?

156
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,290
7:30.

157
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,290
Okay.

158
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,460
You help me cook.

159
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,430
See you there.

160
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,430
Good.

161
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,430
Dr. Charles, do you

162
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,430
have a minute?

163
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,730
Yes.

164
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,870
My patient in

165
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,870
treatment 3 is deaf.

166
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,740
He was clipped by

167
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,740
a motorcycle speeding

168
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,740
through a crosswalk.

169
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,610
Banged up a shoulder,

170
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,610
nothing too bad.

171
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,480
Okay.

172
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,480
His sister is here with him,

173
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,680
and she asked if they

174
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,680
could see a psychiatrist

175
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,680
as soon as possible.

176
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,340
I asked for a certified ASL

177
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,340
interpreter,

178
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,610
but they're out today

179
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,610
with COVID,

180
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,980
so she's been helping out

181
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,980
on that front.

182
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,350
Okay.

183
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,820
Thank you.

184
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,430
Good morning, I'm Dr. Charles.

185
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:33,460
Hi, uh, I'm Sandy.

186
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,830
And this is

187
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,830
my brother, Aiden.

188
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,460
Nice to, uh...

189
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,460
Nice to meet you both.

190
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,970
What's going on?

191
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,970
How can I help?

192
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,280
That.

193
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,250
That's what's going on.

194
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,550
Aiden's hearing voices.

195
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,620
CHICAGO MED

196
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,760
So Aiden,

197
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,760
can you, uh...

198
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,260
Can Aiden read lips?

199
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,300
He's okay. Not great.

200
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,030
It's usually best if I just

201
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,030
interpret through ASL.

202
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,810
Got it.

203
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,810
Aiden.

204
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,350
Hey, Aiden,

205
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,350
pay attention

206
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,350
to Dr. Charles.

207
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,610
He's here to help you.

208
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:23,010
So Aiden, have you

209
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:23,010
been deaf since birth?

210
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:28,480
No, I...

211
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:32,390
when I was a young kid,

212
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:32,390
I got sick,

213
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:32,390
and I became deaf.

214
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:36,060
He had meningitis as

215
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:36,060
a nine-year-old.

216
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,990
Got it. And so these voices

217
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,990
that you've been hearing,

218
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,830
what are they like?

219
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,600
What kinds of things

220
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,600
are they saying to you?

221
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,640
The voices

222
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,640
that I hear,

223
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,010
they're gentle and kind.

224
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,810
They ask

225
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,810
a lot of questions.

226
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,940
They tell me things.

227
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:57,450
Like today, they told me

228
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:57,450
to go outside...

229
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,350
Head to Navy Pier...

230
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,050
And enjoy the sunny day.

231
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,060
And that's where

232
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,060
the accident happened?

233
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:17,660
I was crossing the street,

234
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,800
and I didn't see

235
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,800
a motorbike coming.

236
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,780
I can certainly

237
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,780
understand

238
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,780
how this would be

239
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,370
a very intriguing,

240
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,370
even exciting,

241
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,370
development for you.

242
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,450
Yes. Yes.

243
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,850
I can hear again.

244
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,390
So you know what, Aiden?

245
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,820
I'd like to order

246
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,820
some tests

247
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,820
to just determine

248
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,690
if maybe there have been

249
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,690
any neurological changes

250
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,590
that you've undergone

251
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,590
recently.

252
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,560
You think these are

253
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,560
real voices

254
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,560
Aiden's hearing?

255
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,430
Asking him questions,

256
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,430
telling him to go

257
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,430
to Navy Pier?

258
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,900
I think it's important

259
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,900
for Aiden

260
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,840
that we rule out

261
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,840
any physiological

262
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,840
developments

263
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,640
before we do anything else.

264
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,940
Fine. Let's run the test.

265
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,510
I'm just gonna need

266
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,510
his permission.

267
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,960
Yep. You got it.

268
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,960
Okay. Great.

269
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,660
Hi, Kira. I'm Dr. Asher.

270
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,030
How are you feeling?

271
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,600
Better. I'm not sure

272
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,600
what happened.

273
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,100
Well, you fainted.

274
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,000
Your blood work showed

275
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,000
that you were dehydrated.

276
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,970
And it also revealed

277
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,970
that you're pregnant.

278
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,410
Did you already

279
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,410
know this, Kira?

280
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:35,940
Are you gonna tell my mom?

281
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,640
No, not if

282
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,640
you don't want me to.

283
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,910
Please don't.

284
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,510
She won't understand.

285
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,610
Okay.

286
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,660
Hey, you think maybe

287
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,660
I can do an ultrasound?

288
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,750
So you and I can check out

289
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,750
the fetus together?

290
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,130
Yeah? Okay, great.

291
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,130
I'm just gonna

292
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,130
pull this up, okay?

293
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,560
I haven't done

294
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,560
this part yet.

295
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,560
Kind of nervous.

296
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:00,540
Do not worry.

297
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:00,540
It will not hurt

298
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:00,540
at all, I promise.

299
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,630
Just might be a little cold

300
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,630
in the beginning.

301
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,740
Okay, here we go.

302
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,790
All right.

303
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,650
That is the heartbeat.

304
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,780
From its size, it looks

305
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,780
to be about 20 weeks.

306
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,060
What's wrong?

307
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,820
Usually, the fetus

308
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,820
and the placenta

309
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,660
are attached to

310
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,660
the inside of the uterus,

311
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,030
but that's not

312
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,030
what I'm seeing.

313
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,100
What are you seeing?

314
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,970
I am not exactly sure,

315
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,040
so we are going to

316
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,040
send you for an MRI

317
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,170
to get a more

318
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,170
precise look.

319
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,540
This seems really bad.

320
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,540
No, no, no.

321
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,580
Let's not get ahead of

322
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,580
ourselves, all right?

323
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,010
And I will be right

324
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,010
here with you.

325
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,820
So Kira is awake, stable,

326
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,820
and another doctor

327
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,950
is checking on her

328
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,950
as we speak.

329
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,550
It's drugs, isn't it?

330
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:00,120
She's been so out of it

331
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:00,120
recently, so secretive.

332
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,200
We'll know more

333
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,200
about Kira soon.

334
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,970
I do have your results,

335
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,970
however.

336
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,670
You have a low-grade fever.

337
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,800
Your white blood

338
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,800
count is low,

339
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,040
which means your immune

340
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,040
system is weak.

341
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,210
Here on your chest X-ray,

342
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,510
all right, you have these

343
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,510
small infiltrates

344
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,140
in your lungs, which is

345
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,140
a sign that you could

346
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,140
have pneumonia.

347
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,190
So I'm gonna

348
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,190
start you on antibiotics,

349
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,190
just in case.

350
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:23,850
Okay, but I need to know

351
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:23,850
what's going on with Kira.

352
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,890
You have to

353
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,890
tell me something.

354
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,020
Please?

355
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,860
Okay, just sit tight.

356
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,090
I'll see what I can do.

357
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,240
What's the status

358
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,240
with Kira Ray?

359
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,670
Still working her up.

360
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,210
Yeah, well, her mother

361
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,210
would like to be

362
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,210
looped in.

363
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,670
When I have something

364
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,670
to report,

365
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,610
if Kira gives the okay,

366
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,610
I'll share it.

367
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:45,610
Oh, so now, you're concerned

368
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:45,610
about confidentiality, huh?

369
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,740
You do realize that Kira

370
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,740
is a minor and Kimberly

371
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,880
has the legal right to know

372
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,880
her daughter's health status?

373
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,890
I'm well aware of the issues

374
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,890
surrounding my patient,

375
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,080
whom you are not treating.

376
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,750
Okay, everyone.

377
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,750
Gravity rounds.

378
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,260
We'll start from the top

379
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,260
and work our way down, okay?

380
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,860
Oh, and let's not

381
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,860
forget to welcome back

382
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,860
Dr. Tanaka-Reed.

383
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,290
Glad to have you back

384
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,290
on your feet.

385
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,040
Thank you, Thank you.

386
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,040
All right.

387
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,940
Let's get it.

388
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,310
All right, hey.

389
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,010
Everyone get that

390
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,010
out of your systems?

391
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,940
Oops.

392
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,940
Yeah.

393
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,580
All right, let's go.

394
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,580
Come on.

395
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:29,320
Too bad you didn't go

396
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:29,320
into anesthesia, pal.

397
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,290
'Cause you really know

398
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,290
how to pass gas.

399
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,660
I'm just saying,

400
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,660
it's not as cut and dried

401
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,660
as you make it sound.

402
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,930
Well, we're a hospital.

403
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,230
We're entrusted with

404
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,230
saving lives.

405
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,330
I don't see how turning

406
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,330
a profit even comes into it.

407
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,370
Advanced technology

408
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,370
costs money, Will.

409
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:46,230
For-profit hospitals

410
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:46,230
are able to provide

411
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:46,230
better services,

412
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,830
state-of-the-art

413
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,830
diagnostics...

414
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,240
While gouging the average Joe,

415
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,240
who just needs a chest X-ray

416
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,240
and some antibiotics.

417
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,040
I'm not saying

418
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,040
it's a panacea, Will.

419
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,710
I'm saying money is

420
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,710
not the root of all evil.

421
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,340
It's like I'm dating

422
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,340
Gordon Gekko.

423
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,950
Why do I get the feeling like

424
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,950
I'm sleeping with the enemy?

425
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,390
I've got surgery to get to.

426
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:01,680
See you in a bit.

427
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,090
What about Abe and Ginny?

428
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:08,100
Well, they're both

429
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:08,100
backing Jack.

430
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,130
To turn Med into

431
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,130
a for-profit hospital?

432
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,700
That's surprising.

433
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,360
Well, Jack can be

434
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,360
pretty persuasive.

435
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,830
And he's selling it

436
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,830
as the only way

437
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:19,070
to keep Med

438
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:19,070
on the cutting edge

439
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:19,070
of medical advancement.

440
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,730
Like OR 2.0.

441
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,140
We've got ten votes for

442
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,140
and five against.

443
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:30,150
Now, Jack needs a two-thirds

444
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:30,150
majority to abandon our

445
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:30,150
non-profit status, so...

446
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,720
It seems

447
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,720
I'm the deciding vote.

448
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,750
We're hoping we can

449
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,750
count on you, Vernon.

450
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,080
Yeah.

451
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:38,160
I've been proud to sit

452
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:38,160
on this hospital's board

453
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:38,160
for 23 years.

454
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:41,290
As far as I'm concerned,

455
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:41,290
if it ain't broke,

456
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:41,290
don't fix it.

457
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,200
Well, maybe

458
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,200
if it's badly sprained.

459
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,960
Thank you, Vernon.

460
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,960
This is a big relief.

461
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,900
Yeah, as long as

462
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,900
we won't have any

463
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,900
last-minute defections,

464
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,240
I think we can

465
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,240
breathe easy.

466
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,710
Are you okay?

467
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:58,040
Yeah, yeah, just a headache

468
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:58,040
I can't seem to shake.

469
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,670
You look pretty wobbly

470
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,670
there, brother.

471
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,180
A couple of aspirin,

472
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,180
I'll be fine.

473
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,150
Oh. Vernon?

474
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:09,180
I don't know why I got

475
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:09,180
so dizzy all of a sudden.

476
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,330
So Aiden's scans

477
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,330
came back, all right?

478
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:19,270
No sign of a stroke,

479
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:19,270
um, nothing on the MRI,

480
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:20,960
labs came back clean,

481
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,260
all of which suggests...

482
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:24,340
He still can't

483
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:24,340
hear anything.

484
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:24,340
Correct.

485
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,740
And so at this point,

486
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,740
I have a strong hunch

487
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,280
that what we're probably

488
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,280
looking at

489
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,040
is an early presentation

490
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,040
of schizophrenia

491
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,770
or schizoaffective disorder.

492
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,870
What do we do?

493
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,180
There's gotta be some

494
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,180
sort of medication

495
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,810
he can take to make

496
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,810
the voices go away.

497
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,010
There are a lot of options.

498
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,010
It's a treatable disease,

499
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,010
okay?

500
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,450
First thing we need to do,

501
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,450
though, is just to bring

502
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,450
Aiden up to speed.

503
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:50,920
Aiden is wondering

504
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:50,920
why it's a bad thing

505
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:50,920
for him to hear voices.

506
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:54,370
Look, you're hearing things

507
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:54,370
for the first time in years,

508
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:58,840
and it's wonderful, right?

509
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:58,840
These voices, they're kind,

510
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:58,840
they're gentle.

511
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,240
Problem is, that's very

512
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,240
likely gonna change.

513
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:04,800
Chances are good

514
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:04,800
that these voices

515
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:04,800
could become unpleasant.

516
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,400
They might even ask you

517
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,400
to do something

518
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,180
that could put you

519
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,180
in harm's way.

520
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,220
Aiden's wondering

521
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,220
if medication

522
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,220
is the best treatment.

523
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,090
Medication is an excellent

524
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,090
treatment, okay?

525
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,490
I've had countless patients

526
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,420
who have been

527
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,420
helped tremendously

528
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,420
by medication.

529
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,330
Will the voices

530
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,330
go away completely?

531
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,840
You know, there's no

532
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,840
ironclad guarantee.

533
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,930
At the very least,

534
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,930
they will be tamped down,

535
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,370
if not suppressed

536
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,370
altogether.

537
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,870
Then, yeah,

538
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,870
I want to do that.

539
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,070
Can we start now?

540
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,480
Absolutely. Yeah.

541
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,880
We can absolutely start now.

542
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,110
Okay.

543
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,480
Well, great.

544
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,480
Thank you.

545
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:49,780
Wonderful.

546
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,520
Well done. It's a big step.

547
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,520
A nurse

548
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,520
will be in shortly,

549
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,520
and I'll be back

550
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,920
to check up on you later

551
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,920
in the day, okay?

552
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:04,240
So you said you've

553
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:04,240
been experiencing

554
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:04,240
headaches recently?

555
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:07,240
Uh, off and on for

556
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:07,240
about ten days.

557
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,170
Okay, well, Vernon,

558
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,170
I'm inclined to send you

559
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,510
for a head CT,

560
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,510
just to be safe,

561
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:13,450
but in the meantime,

562
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:13,450
here, follow my finger.

563
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,550
Morning, Tess.

564
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:18,320
Oh, wow.

565
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,890
Who are you

566
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,890
looking to impress?

567
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,250
Impress?

568
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,850
I had to get

569
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,850
my driver's license renewed.

570
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,290
I have to live with

571
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,290
that thing for,

572
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,290
like, five years.

573
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,120
True. You look fabulous.

574
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,890
Thank you.

575
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,890
Better go get changed.

576
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,360
All righty.

577
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:35,230
Seizing!

578
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:38,200
Two milligrams

579
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:38,200
of Ativan, IM, stat.

580
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,870
It's okay!

581
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:42,030
Everything's gonna

582
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:42,030
be all right, Vernon.

583
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,540
Hold on.

584
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,250
I don't understand.

585
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,840
He was fine this morning,

586
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,840
and now you're telling me

587
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,080
he has some kind of

588
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,080
brain tumor?

589
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,560
A noncancerous tumor.

590
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,560
"Acoustic neuroma" is

591
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,560
the technical term.

592
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,360
It's most likely

593
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,360
been growing slowly over

594
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,360
the past few months,

595
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,930
compressing your

596
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,930
husband's brain stem

597
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,060
and impacting his hearing

598
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,060
and balance.

599
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,190
So how do we fix it?

600
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,560
I go in and take it out.

601
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:10,160
But it is open-brain

602
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:10,160
surgery, right?

603
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,570
What are the potential risks?

604
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:14,540
Because of the tumor's

605
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:14,540
location, it might be

606
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:14,540
tricky to resect.

607
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,080
There's an elevated risk

608
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,080
of asymmetric paralysis.

609
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,940
His face?

610
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,640
Phyllis, Dr. Abrams is

611
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,640
the best neurosurgeon

612
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,640
in the city.

613
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,010
That's true.

614
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,920
Are there any other options?

615
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,190
Any updates?

616
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,190
Not yet.

617
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,890
And I guess with

618
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,890
this development,

619
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,490
the vote's gonna need

620
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,490
to be canceled now.

621
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,410
Jack's looking

622
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,410
to push the agenda as-is.

623
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,640
You're kidding.

624
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,640
No.

625
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,540
He's eager to come

626
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,540
to a quick resolution

627
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:55,140
so that everyone can

628
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:55,140
have an extended break

629
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,550
while Vernon recuperates.

630
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:59,680
Yeah, and he can secure

631
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:59,680
his two-thirds majority.

632
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:03,950
Well, Jack didn't make

633
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:03,950
his fortune by not taking

634
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:03,950
advantage of opportunities.

635
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,490
She's electing

636
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,490
to forgo surgery

637
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,650
and move forward

638
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,650
with a noninvasive

639
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,650
radio treatment.

640
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,060
Abrams is hopeful that will

641
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,060
shrink the tumor over time.

642
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,030
When can he be extubated?

643
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,030
I don't know.

644
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:16,230
Even intubated, we're still

645
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:16,230
having trouble controlling

646
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:16,230
his seizures.

647
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,630
Well, I'll go

648
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,630
whip the vote again.

649
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,640
See if I can flip someone.

650
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:25,680
They're still gonna

651
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:25,680
have the vote today?

652
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,580
Don't even concern

653
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,580
yourself with that,

654
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,580
Dr. Halstead.

655
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:33,280
Just see that Vernon gets

656
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:33,280
the best care possible.

657
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,980
What do we got?

658
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:38,580
35-year-old Brendan Metz,

659
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:38,580
took multiple GSWs

660
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:40,160
stopping a bank robbery.

661
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,390
Hole in right thigh,

662
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,390
actively bleeding

663
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,390
when we got him.

664
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,970
Pressure's stable.

665
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,970
Lost about 500 mils

666
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,970
of blood

667
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,090
before we got

668
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,090
the tourniquet on him.

669
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,030
Pushed 50 mics

670
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,030
of fentanyl

671
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,030
on the way over.

672
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,660
Okay. Hey, Brendan,

673
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,660
you're at Chicago Med.

674
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,470
We're gonna take

675
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,470
good care of you, okay?

676
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,060
Hang in there for me, bud.

677
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,980
Nice and easy,

678
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,980
on my count, okay?

679
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,180
One, two, three.

680
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,050
Thank you, Matt, Juliette.

681
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,620
So Brendan, seems you're

682
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,620
some kind of hero, huh?

683
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,350
I feel more like a fool

684
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,350
at the moment.

685
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:13,050
Well, the world could use

686
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:13,050
a lot more fools like you.

687
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,250
What are we looking at?

688
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,700
Hole number one,

689
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,700
right anterior axillary line

690
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,700
at the umbilicus.

691
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,200
Number two,

692
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,200
midaxillary line at the flank

693
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,200
at the same level.

694
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,240
Okay, do they connect?

695
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:25,000
Uh, yeah, I think so.

696
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,100
Let me swab.

697
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:34,200
Definitely connecting

698
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:34,200
our superficial.

699
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,310
How about the leg?

700
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,310
Thank you.

701
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:39,650
Um, uh, two holes

702
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:39,650
here as well.

703
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:43,560
Number three,

704
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:43,560
mid-medial thigh,

705
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:43,560
four, lateral mid-thigh.

706
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,750
No pulses

707
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,750
with a tourniquet up,

708
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,150
so let's go ahead

709
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,150
and loosen that,

710
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,730
see what we're

711
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,730
working with.

712
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,760
Type and cross him

713
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,760
for 6 and 6, and push

714
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,760
one of each for now.

715
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,430
Ooh.

716
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,230
Definitely arterial.

717
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,570
It's a hard sign.

718
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,730
Go ahead and retighten

719
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,730
the tourniquet,

720
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,370
and get me X-rays

721
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,370
of the leg and torso.

722
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,780
Come here.

723
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,410
What was that?

724
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,080
Rookie mistake,

725
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,080
putting yourself in the

726
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,080
line of fire like that.

727
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,180
I guess I'm just

728
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,180
a little off my game.

729
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,820
All right.

730
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,820
Go get changed

731
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,820
and cleaned up.

732
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,550
Hi.

733
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:33,810
Kira, have you ever

734
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:33,810
heard of the term

735
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:33,810
"ectopic pregnancy"?

736
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,680
It's when a fertilized

737
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,680
egg implants

738
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,610
in the outside

739
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,610
of the uterus.

740
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:43,210
Is that what's

741
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:43,210
happening to me?

742
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:43,210
Mm-hmm.

743
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:47,150
Your MRI revealed that

744
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:47,150
you have a rare type

745
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:47,150
of an ectopic pregnancy.

746
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,810
It's called an

747
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,810
abdominal pregnancy.

748
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,150
The fetus has attached

749
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,150
to the vena cava,

750
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,520
which is a huge vein

751
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,520
that leads to your heart.

752
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,330
But the baby's okay, right?

753
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,690
I mean, we saw

754
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,690
its heartbeat.

755
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,790
Yeah, at the moment, it is.

756
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,740
But if the placenta

757
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,740
damages the vena cava

758
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,740
for any reason,

759
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,830
that could cause severe

760
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,830
internal bleeding,

761
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,770
which would, in turn,

762
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,770
put your life in jeopardy.

763
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,400
So what are you saying?

764
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:13,110
For your safety,

765
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:16,480
you need to have surgery

766
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:16,480
to remove the fetus.

767
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,580
Will the baby survive?

768
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,880
At only 20 weeks, no.

769
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,750
I'm so sorry.

770
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,620
No. No, you don't

771
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,620
understand.

772
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,320
My mom needs this baby.

773
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,760
What do you mean?

774
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,460
My mom has a rare

775
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,460
stem cell disease.

776
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,470
It's why we came in today.

777
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,470
She needs a donor,

778
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,470
but the doctors

779
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,470
couldn't find one,

780
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:37,630
and I'm not a match

781
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:37,630
for her, so...

782
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,610
so I got pregnant.

783
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:45,200
In hopes that this baby

784
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:45,200
would be a stem cell match

785
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:45,200
for your mom?

786
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,680
Yeah.

787
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,770
Okay, Kira, this is

788
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,770
a human being that

789
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,770
we're talking about.

790
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,480
I know, but I'm gonna

791
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,480
raise the baby, and

792
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,480
I'm gonna be a good mom.

793
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,610
You're so young, Kira.

794
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,210
Being a mom right now,

795
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,820
your life would never

796
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,820
be the same.

797
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:01,420
I can do this,

798
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:01,420
and I want to.

799
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:04,470
And... And I always

800
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:04,470
planned on having kids,

801
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,860
so why not start now?

802
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:09,230
Because it's just

803
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:09,230
too dangerous

804
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:09,230
right now, Kira.

805
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,330
But what if we waited

806
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,330
a little bit

807
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,330
and let the baby

808
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,310
grow a little more

809
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,310
before the surgery?

810
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,470
Would it survive then?

811
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:25,250
Hey, you're free, right?

812
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:25,250
Yeah.

813
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:28,950
I'd love your eyes

814
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:28,950
on this acoustic neuroma.

815
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:28,950
Hmm.

816
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:30,920
You think your mapping

817
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:30,920
tech could help

818
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,850
someone like Abrams

819
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,850
confidently resect that?

820
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,520
Abrams wants a second

821
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,520
opinion from 2.0?

822
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,760
That's hard to believe.

823
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,890
I'm just doing some extra

824
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,890
legwork for a patient

825
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,890
I'm concerned about.

826
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,630
Well, let's upload

827
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,630
the CT and MRI and

828
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,630
see what they say.

829
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,910
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

830
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,870
I know, I know!

831
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,870
It's okay!

832
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,280
Aiden! Stop,

833
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,280
please, look at me!

834
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,570
Aiden, Aiden, Aiden!

835
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,940
What happened?

836
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,940
I don't know!

837
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,850
It's okay, buddy!

838
00:20:58,950 --> 00:20:59,940
What's he saying?

839
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,650
I don't know!

840
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,650
Take it easy, buddy.

841
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,420
Wait!

842
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,420
Soft restraints, please!

843
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,290
Calm down!

844
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,290
Five of Haldol.

845
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,690
Calm down, Aiden!

846
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:29,250
Uh, care to explain

847
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:29,250
your plans for this

848
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:29,250
abdominal pregnancy?

849
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,820
Of course you checked

850
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,820
Kira's chart.

851
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,780
She needs surgery

852
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,780
immediately.

853
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:33,880
Move her upstairs.

854
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,980
I'm holding off

855
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,980
for now.

856
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,980
Why?

857
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:39,990
Kira wants to delay

858
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:39,990
the surgery until

859
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:39,990
the baby is viable.

860
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:42,390
She hopes that it

861
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:42,390
could be a stem cell

862
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:42,390
match for her mother.

863
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,930
Oh, you're joking.

864
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,930
You're joking.

865
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,660
It's the reason

866
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,660
Kira got pregnant.

867
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,000
That is absurd!

868
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,930
And morally repugnant.

869
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,560
She might as well be

870
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,560
organ harvesting.

871
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:52,500
She's operating

872
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:52,500
from a place of

873
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:52,500
care and concern,

874
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:54,300
not just about her mother,

875
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:54,300
but for the baby,

876
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,600
and she seems pretty

877
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,600
clear-headed about it.

878
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:58,300
That cannot possibly be

879
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:58,300
what her mother wants.

880
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:01,540
If you can't convince Kira

881
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:01,540
to change her mind,

882
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:01,540
then Kimberly will.

883
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:04,450
Kira doesn't want

884
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:04,450
her mother knowing

885
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:04,450
anything about this.

886
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:07,850
And she has

887
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:07,850
medical emancipation

888
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:07,850
because she's pregnant,

889
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,820
so she can do

890
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,820
anything she wants.

891
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:21,330
So, good news, Brendan.

892
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,730
The bullet you took

893
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,730
in your side passed

894
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,730
through your love handle.

895
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,600
It's superficial,

896
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,600
and there's nothing

897
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,600
more to do.

898
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:26,940
It'll heal on its own.

899
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,030
Your leg, however...

900
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,830
it's gonna need surgery

901
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,830
emergently, okay?

902
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,350
We're gonna have to

903
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,350
fix the artery,

904
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:34,420
or you will lose your leg.

905
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:34,420
The OR is ready right now.

906
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,350
We just need you to sign

907
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,350
the consent forms,

908
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:38,980
and we'll bring

909
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:38,980
you up, okay?

910
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:41,060
You're in good hands,

911
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:41,060
all right?

912
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,350
Is my leg gonna

913
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,350
be all right?

914
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,760
Excuse me?

915
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,620
Well, I prom...

916
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:48,530
I promised my kid

917
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,100
I'd coach his soccer team

918
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,100
next season.

919
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,870
I'll be able to do that,

920
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,870
won't I?

921
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,460
We can for sure

922
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,460
fix the artery.

923
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,090
But the nerve runs

924
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,090
right next to it.

925
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,460
We won't know if

926
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,460
you'll have full motor

927
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:57,730
and sensory function

928
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:57,730
until after...

929
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,070
Walk in the park

930
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,070
for us, Brendan.

931
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,110
Don't you fret

932
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,110
a lick now, okay?

933
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:04,640
Okay.

934
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,380
What was that?

935
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:15,750
I was just answering

936
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:15,750
his question.

937
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:18,620
No, you were raising

938
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:18,620
a patient's stress level

939
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:18,620
unnecessarily.

940
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,890
He needed to be informed.

941
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,890
Things happen in surgery.

942
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,660
Why would anything go wrong?

943
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,600
For any number of reasons.

944
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,600
I don't know.

945
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,100
Is this about the teasing?

946
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,430
Is what about the teasing?

947
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,700
All right, look.

948
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,500
You've been lording

949
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,500
over Liam and

950
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,500
the other residents

951
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:34,770
for almost a year now.

952
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,840
You had to assume

953
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,840
they'd try to knock

954
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,840
you down a peg

955
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,910
if they found a vulnerability,

956
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,910
and well, you gift-wrapped

957
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,910
them a doozy.

958
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:42,110
Whatever. It happened.

959
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,710
Proves you're human.

960
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,810
Laugh it off, and don't

961
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,810
let them get to you.

962
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,550
I'm not letting them

963
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,550
get to me.

964
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,820
Maybe it's best

965
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,820
if I sit this one out.

966
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,420
I'm sorry.

967
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:56,390
I don't have

968
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:56,390
the manpower

969
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:56,390
to spare.

970
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:04,070
Sorry to interrupt.

971
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:07,570
Not sure if you heard,

972
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:07,570
but Vernon's wife okayed

973
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:07,570
the craniectomy.

974
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,700
She's moving forward

975
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,700
with the surgery?

976
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:13,540
Dr. Abrams and Song are

977
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:13,540
prepping OR 2.0 as we speak.

978
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:16,480
What got Phyllis to

979
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:16,480
change her mind?

980
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,420
Once Dr. Song confirmed

981
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,420
2.0 could reduce

982
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,420
much of the risk,

983
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,420
I guess she felt

984
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,420
the assurance

985
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,420
she needed to go ahead.

986
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,620
Wow.

987
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,850
When can we expect

988
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,850
Vernon to come out

989
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,430
from under anesthesia?

990
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:28,790
From what I understand,

991
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:28,790
about three or four hours.

992
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:28,790
Ha!

993
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,030
Perhaps I can delay the vote.

994
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,860
At least until

995
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,860
Vernon wakes up.

996
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,440
Good job, Dr. Halstead.

997
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,670
Hey, Mags,

998
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,670
if I recall correctly,

999
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,870
you know ASL, right?

1000
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,140
That means yes.

1001
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,550
Okay.

1002
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,550
What does this mean?

1003
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:57,990
Something like,

1004
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:57,990
"You take voices away."

1005
00:24:58,090 --> 00:24:59,720
Huh.

1006
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:02,160
You know, I'm treating

1007
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:02,160
a deaf patient,

1008
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,230
and his sister's been

1009
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,230
interpreting for us.

1010
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:06,230
I'm starting to wonder if,

1011
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:08,060
I don't know, we're getting

1012
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:08,060
our signals crossed

1013
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,500
or something like that.

1014
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:14,600
You want me

1015
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:14,600
to spy for you?

1016
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:14,600
Too strong a word.

1017
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,210
How are we doing?

1018
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:23,510
You think it might

1019
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:23,510
be time to get these

1020
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:23,510
restraints off?

1021
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:27,650
See if we can maybe

1022
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:27,650
figure out what

1023
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:27,650
happened earlier.

1024
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,120
Aiden's calmed

1025
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,120
down a lot.

1026
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,120
Great.

1027
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:51,230
Uh, Aiden's upset

1028
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:51,230
because the voices

1029
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:51,230
told him the nurses

1030
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,280
were gonna make

1031
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,280
his shoulder

1032
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,280
pain worse.

1033
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,520
Um, Aiden, I'm sorry.

1034
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:58,950
Risperidone is typically

1035
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:58,950
one of the faster-acting

1036
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:58,950
medications,

1037
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:00,540
but sometimes takes

1038
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:00,540
a little longer.

1039
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:03,590
So, uh, how about

1040
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:03,590
we check back in a bit,

1041
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:06,630
and maybe we can

1042
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:06,630
have a chat then?

1043
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,090
Okay?

1044
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:19,710
He didn't say anything

1045
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:19,710
about a nurse, did he?

1046
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:22,280
He's upset because

1047
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:22,280
he can't hear the voices

1048
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:22,280
in his head anymore.

1049
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,740
He suspects it's

1050
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,740
because of the pills

1051
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,740
that he's been given.

1052
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,180
Yeah, the antipsychotics,

1053
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,940
which I dispensed with

1054
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,940
his permission.

1055
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:29,280
Or so I was told.

1056
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:32,850
He thought

1057
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:32,850
it was painkillers,

1058
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:32,850
not antipsychotics.

1059
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,220
Huh.

1060
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:42,590
Her BP is dropping,

1061
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:42,590
and her hemoglobin's

1062
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:42,590
down to 8.

1063
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,790
Kira?

1064
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,790
It hurts! It hurts!

1065
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,600
Free fluid in the belly,

1066
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,600
likely blood.

1067
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,730
Kira, we can't hold off

1068
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,730
on the surgery any longer.

1069
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,210
Call the OR, tell them

1070
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,210
to open it stat.

1071
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,110
We're bringing Kira up

1072
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,110
right away.

1073
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:58,010
No! Please, no!

1074
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,350
I need to talk

1075
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,350
to you about Kira.

1076
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:21,700
I need you for a second.

1077
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:21,700
Please, no!

1078
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:24,770
If at any point

1079
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:24,770
during the surgery

1080
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:27,600
you have to make the call

1081
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:27,600
between Kira and the fetus,

1082
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:30,300
please, please,

1083
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:30,300
save my little girl.

1084
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,140
We have every intention

1085
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,140
of doing just that.

1086
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,220
We'll have someone

1087
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,220
keep you in the loop,

1088
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,220
Kimberly.

1089
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:37,710
I thought you should

1090
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:37,710
hear that for yourself.

1091
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,980
I cannot believe

1092
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,980
you told her.

1093
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,380
What about HIPAA?

1094
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:41,920
Her daughter is heading

1095
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:41,920
into emergency surgery.

1096
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,390
If there's a crisis

1097
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,390
and a decision

1098
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,390
needs to be made,

1099
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:46,160
it's Kimberly who'll do it.

1100
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,700
Just came from

1101
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,700
the pharmacy.

1102
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,770
They wouldn't fill

1103
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,770
Aiden's prescription

1104
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,770
for Risperidone?

1105
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,900
Well, I canceled it, Sandy,

1106
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,900
because it turns out

1107
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:03,410
it was prescribed

1108
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:03,410
without the permission

1109
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:03,410
of the patient.

1110
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,240
We should probably

1111
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,240
have a talk.

1112
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,940
She knows ASL?

1113
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,350
She does.

1114
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:19,850
What's he saying?

1115
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,430
He's saying that

1116
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,430
he knows that she's

1117
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,430
been lying to him.

1118
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:24,060
Take the medication.

1119
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,660
I was trying to help you.

1120
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,830
But the voices,

1121
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,830
they aren't real.

1122
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,210
Aiden says that

1123
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,210
he doesn't care that

1124
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,210
the voices are not real.

1125
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:42,150
Sandy, the only way

1126
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:42,150
that we're gonna forge

1127
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:42,150
a path forward...

1128
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,840
I'm not sure

1129
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,840
there is a path

1130
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,840
forward here.

1131
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:46,790
Aiden only cares

1132
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:46,790
about hearing

1133
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:46,790
the voices in his head.

1134
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:48,880
And I won't stand by

1135
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:48,880
and watch

1136
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:52,820
if you won't do

1137
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:52,820
anything about it.

1138
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,900
Okay, great.

1139
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,170
Looks like we have enough

1140
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,170
length to sew the two ends

1141
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,170
directly together.

1142
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:06,070
5-0 Prolene stitch.

1143
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:07,400
I'm sorry, Dr. Marcel?

1144
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,910
What is it?

1145
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:12,000
I was told to inform you

1146
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:12,000
that there is an emergent

1147
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:12,000
situation in the OR 2.0

1148
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:14,880
that requires your

1149
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:14,880
immediate attention.

1150
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,310
They're aware I'm in

1151
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,310
the middle of surgery?

1152
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,850
They are aware, yes.

1153
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:23,120
Oh, come on.

1154
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:23,120
All right, everyone.

1155
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,490
Dr. Tanaka-Reed

1156
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,490
will continue on with

1157
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,490
the anastomosis

1158
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,320
until I return.

1159
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,320
Follow his lead.

1160
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,760
We can wait

1161
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,760
until you get back.

1162
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:32,230
No, I don't wanna prolong

1163
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:32,230
his ischemic timing

1164
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:32,230
any more than necessary.

1165
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:34,320
Get the anastomosis done.

1166
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,200
I'll be back

1167
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,200
as soon as I can.

1168
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:41,970
That's great.

1169
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:41,970
Thank you, Trish.

1170
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,940
Pull up the feed in there

1171
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,940
so I can watch.

1172
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,950
Oh, sure.

1173
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,340
All right.

1174
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:49,810
Here goes.

1175
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:49,810
Awesome. Thank you.

1176
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:07,200
Trust me, I get how

1177
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:07,200
frustrating it can be

1178
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,500
to try and help somebody

1179
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,500
who doesn't want it.

1180
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,770
He has no idea

1181
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,770
what he's doing.

1182
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:12,360
You know,

1183
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:12,360
I'm not sure any of us

1184
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:15,530
can really understand

1185
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:15,530
what he's going through

1186
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:15,530
right now.

1187
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,210
You must think

1188
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,210
I'm a horrible person.

1189
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,540
I do not.

1190
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,370
Not at all.

1191
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,880
I understand how difficult

1192
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,880
it can be for family members

1193
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,140
to get this kind of news.

1194
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:28,310
And I completely get

1195
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:28,310
the impulse to just wanna

1196
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:28,310
fix it immediately.

1197
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:35,190
You know, I had my own issues

1198
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:35,190
with mental illness before.

1199
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,320
I know it's not

1200
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,320
schizophrenia,

1201
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:40,160
but I suffered

1202
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:40,160
with depression.

1203
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:41,930
Really?

1204
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:45,010
It was especially bad

1205
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:45,010
after our parents died.

1206
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:48,010
Car accident.

1207
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:48,010
Aiden was still in

1208
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:48,010
high school at the time.

1209
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,940
Oh, man.

1210
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,570
I can't even imagine.

1211
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,250
Aiden got by somehow.

1212
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:58,150
Maybe it was because

1213
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:58,150
he had already suffered

1214
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,950
his own personal tragedy,

1215
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,950
losing his hearing,

1216
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:02,450
but he was more resilient.

1217
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:07,420
I was such a mess.

1218
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:11,020
My meds saved my life.

1219
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:14,230
I don't know what

1220
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:14,230
I would do without them,

1221
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:14,230
honestly.

1222
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,930
And I can't stomach

1223
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,930
the idea of watching Aiden

1224
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,060
go through anything

1225
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,060
like what I did.

1226
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,110
I get it. I do.

1227
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,450
Have you ever told Aiden

1228
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,450
about any of this stuff?

1229
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:36,610
The last thing I'd ever

1230
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:36,610
wanna do is burden Aiden

1231
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:36,610
with my problems.

1232
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,590
He doesn't need that.

1233
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:41,990
I think you might be

1234
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:41,990
surprised by what he's

1235
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:41,990
capable of handling.

1236
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,620
You know, people who learn

1237
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,620
to manage this disease,

1238
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:47,160
they live full,

1239
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:47,160
productive lives.

1240
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,960
I mean, they can, really.

1241
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:52,060
You know, listen,

1242
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:52,060
outcomes improve significantly

1243
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:54,870
when loving family members

1244
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:54,870
stay involved.

1245
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:58,040
So you know, he's gonna

1246
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:58,040
be relying on you,

1247
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:58,040
especially at first.

1248
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:01,080
But with a little luck,

1249
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:01,080
sooner rather than later,

1250
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:05,210
he's probably

1251
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:05,210
gonna be able to

1252
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:05,210
return that favor.

1253
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:10,220
And, um, how wonderful

1254
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:10,220
would that be?

1255
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,990
Vernon should be out of

1256
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,990
surgery any minute now.

1257
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:29,180
Strange how Phyllis

1258
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:29,180
changed her mind.

1259
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,210
Happens pretty frequently,

1260
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,210
actually.

1261
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:33,300
A big decision like that.

1262
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,410
Sometimes people need

1263
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,410
a little time to process.

1264
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,420
So how'd it go?

1265
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,150
Fairly certain we got

1266
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,150
a complete resection.

1267
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,690
No problem with the margins,

1268
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,690
as far as I can tell.

1269
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,960
Electrophysiology

1270
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,960
looked perfect.

1271
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,330
But you don't know

1272
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,330
for sure yet, right?

1273
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:52,300
So how long exactly

1274
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:52,300
until he wakes up?

1275
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,630
I'm a brain surgeon, Jack.

1276
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:56,930
Not a soothsayer.

1277
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,970
Is it gonna be today?

1278
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,970
What can I say, Jack?

1279
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:01,130
When he's ready to be

1280
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:01,130
extubated, he will be.

1281
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:09,070
Jack seems awfully interested

1282
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:09,070
in Vernon's recovery time.

1283
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,050
Pretty sure it's about

1284
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,050
the board meeting later.

1285
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:12,480
He's probably sweating

1286
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:12,480
now that Vernon might

1287
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,420
be able to vote against him.

1288
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,250
Vernon's the deciding vote?

1289
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,190
That's what I hear.

1290
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:20,390
Were you aware of that

1291
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:20,390
when you urged me

1292
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:20,390
to get involved?

1293
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:24,720
I heard rumors of you

1294
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:24,720
acting like a cowboy.

1295
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:27,060
That's not

1296
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:27,060
what happened today.

1297
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:28,730
I came here out of

1298
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:28,730
concern for the patient.

1299
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,270
Who are you trying

1300
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,270
to convince with that?

1301
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,270
Me or you?

1302
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:46,180
Well, your facial

1303
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:46,180
movement's symmetrical,

1304
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,280
and your hearing

1305
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,280
appears to be intact.

1306
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:51,320
What a relief.

1307
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:51,320
Thank you all.

1308
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,720
Well, I understand

1309
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,720
a celebration is in order.

1310
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,150
It appears so.

1311
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,460
My apologies to

1312
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,460
everyone for the scare.

1313
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,590
The board is gonna be

1314
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,590
excited to hear the news.

1315
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:04,070
Speaking of, um,

1316
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:04,070
the meeting's

1317
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:04,070
about to start.

1318
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:05,430
Look, Vernon, no one

1319
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:05,430
would question you

1320
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,240
if you opted to

1321
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,240
sit this one out.

1322
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,740
Well, I certainly don't

1323
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,740
feel like I'm ready

1324
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,140
to get out of bed,

1325
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,140
but I wonder

1326
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,140
if it'd be possible

1327
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,080
for me to

1328
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,080
video-conference in.

1329
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:18,140
Of course.

1330
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:18,140
We can make that happen.

1331
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,410
Great.

1332
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,580
Well, I'll see you then.

1333
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,730
Triphasic signals.

1334
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:34,160
Well, is that good?

1335
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,360
Pulse is strong.

1336
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:37,160
Exactly what

1337
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:37,160
we were hoping for.

1338
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:40,500
In a few weeks,

1339
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:40,500
you can start getting

1340
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:40,500
ready for soccer season.

1341
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:42,630
Man, thank you.

1342
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:42,630
Thank you both.

1343
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,730
You bet.

1344
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,210
Nice job, by the way.

1345
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,550
Like you said,

1346
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,550
I can handle it on my own.

1347
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:52,380
Indeed.

1348
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,150
I checked the board

1349
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,150
when I got out of surgery

1350
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:57,250
and noticed that Abrams

1351
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:57,250
was using the OR 2.0

1352
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:57,250
this afternoon.

1353
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,790
No record of you

1354
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,790
stepping in at all.

1355
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:01,390
Yeah.

1356
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:03,160
Wires must have gotten

1357
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:03,160
crossed somewhere.

1358
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,390
It was actually Onc Surg

1359
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,390
that needed a hand.

1360
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,530
I know you're probably

1361
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,530
lying to me.

1362
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,660
But I'm appreciative

1363
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,660
nonetheless.

1364
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,440
It'll be okay.

1365
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,440
Kira!

1366
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,240
Mom?

1367
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:21,400
Is she gonna be okay?

1368
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:21,400
Yes.

1369
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:24,780
She has some recovery

1370
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:24,780
time ahead of her,

1371
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:24,780
but she'll be okay.

1372
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,820
Unfortunately,

1373
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,820
we were not able

1374
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,820
to save the fetus.

1375
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,560
I'm so sorry, Mom.

1376
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:34,120
Oh, Kira, honey.

1377
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:34,120
What were you thinking?

1378
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,420
You need a stem cell donor.

1379
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:38,330
I thought that maybe

1380
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:38,330
if I had a baby, then...

1381
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,260
Look at me, honey.

1382
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:42,360
I'm gonna be...

1383
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:46,130
We're gonna

1384
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:46,130
get through this, okay?

1385
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,800
We haven't found

1386
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,800
a donor yet,

1387
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:50,140
but these things,

1388
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:50,140
they take time.

1389
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,840
What if we can't?

1390
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:55,880
We just have to be brave.

1391
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,620
I know that won't be

1392
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,620
hard for you.

1393
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,550
We're gonna give you

1394
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,550
some privacy.

1395
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:08,890
Boy, is she lucky.

1396
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:08,890
Oh, absolutely.

1397
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,250
Kira could have died today.

1398
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,590
I'm talking about Kimberly.

1399
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,330
How unbelievably lucky

1400
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,330
she is to have a daughter

1401
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,500
willing to make such

1402
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,500
a generous act of love.

1403
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,710
How are Aiden

1404
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,710
and Sandy doing?

1405
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:31,220
It looks like

1406
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:31,220
they're working it out.

1407
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:35,450
Aw, looks like they made up.

1408
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:40,360
Yeah. Nothing like

1409
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:40,360
coming clean to

1410
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:40,360
re-establish trust.

1411
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:47,530
Hey.

1412
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,930
Can we talk?

1413
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,730
Yeah.

1414
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,730
Yeah?

1415
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,210
All right, uh...

1416
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:02,520
This morning,

1417
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:02,520
your offer, uh...

1418
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,740
You realize what this

1419
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,740
could mean, right?

1420
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:08,290
If you have some sort

1421
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:08,290
of health crisis someday

1422
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:11,290
with only one kidney left...

1423
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:11,290
I know what I'm risking.

1424
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:15,790
You do not have to do this.

1425
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:15,790
Dad, you don't understand.

1426
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,420
I need to do this.

1427
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:19,620
Well...

1428
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:24,800
If you turn out

1429
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:24,800
to be a match,

1430
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,240
I won't say no.

1431
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,850
And golumpki?

1432
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:41,250
Oh, my gosh, delicious.

1433
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:42,410
Thank you.

1434
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,960
Liliana is a wonderful cook.

1435
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,380
And you know what?

1436
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:47,260
She can clean.

1437
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,390
A professional.

1438
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,390
You don't need a maid now.

1439
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,260
Pavel.

1440
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,260
What?

1441
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,920
It was a joke!

1442
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:55,330
Here.

1443
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:55,330
No, I'm good.

1444
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,990
Thank you very much.

1445
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,990
It's delicious.

1446
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,670
I gotta drive. Gotta drive.

1447
00:37:58,770 --> 00:37:59,830
Oh, good!

1448
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,770
Responsible.

1449
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,700
So.

1450
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:07,440
Pan Daniel.

1451
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:08,670
Pan? Pan Daniel?

1452
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,840
It means "sir."

1453
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:13,850
You are an important man

1454
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:13,850
with an important job.

1455
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,290
Oh, I don't know

1456
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,290
about that.

1457
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:18,980
Um, I can't imagine

1458
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:18,980
doing anything else.

1459
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:21,020
Certainly keeps me

1460
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:21,020
on my toes.

1461
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:23,990
A lucky man who

1462
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:23,990
doesn't hate his job.

1463
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,560
Say that again.

1464
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,560
Lucky indeed.

1465
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:31,040
So tell me, Doctor.

1466
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,860
You deal with any

1467
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,860
crazy people today?

1468
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:34,570
You know what, Pavel?

1469
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:34,570
Even if I wanted to,

1470
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:35,840
I wouldn't be able

1471
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:35,840
to tell you.

1472
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,600
And honestly,

1473
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,600
I don't love that word.

1474
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:40,680
I don't know, maybe it's

1475
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:40,680
a shrink thing. Anyway.

1476
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:43,510
I'm sorry.

1477
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:43,510
My English is not so good.

1478
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,710
It's okay.

1479
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,710
Not so correct.

1480
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,340
I didn't mean to offend.

1481
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,720
None taken, whatsoever.

1482
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:51,350
But you must have

1483
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:51,350
some good stories.

1484
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,620
Pavel!

1485
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,620
What?

1486
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:56,720
He doesn't want to

1487
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:56,720
talk about his work.

1488
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:56,720
I get it.

1489
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:58,530
I think I'm going to

1490
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:58,530
check on the babka.

1491
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,930
And I'm gonna get rid

1492
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,930
of some of these dishes.

1493
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:16,340
What did he...

1494
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:16,340
What did he say?

1495
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:17,780
Oh, he was, uh...

1496
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:21,340
He was just wondering

1497
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:21,340
if we had any more vodka.

1498
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,430
Hey, Sharon.

1499
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:33,560
Do you have a minute?

1500
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,000
Oh, is it important, Maggie?

1501
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,800
This is really

1502
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,800
not a good time.

1503
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,530
It kind of is.

1504
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,900
Okay, come. Come here.

1505
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:42,500
What's up?

1506
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:45,080
I lied to you earlier,

1507
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:45,080
and I feel horrible

1508
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:45,080
about it.

1509
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,070
Lied? About what?

1510
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:50,370
I didn't get all dressed up

1511
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:50,370
to renew my driver's license.

1512
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,540
I was meeting with

1513
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,540
a headhunter.

1514
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:54,750
About maybe

1515
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:54,750
finding another job.

1516
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,580
Okay.

1517
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:59,680
I was frustrated last week

1518
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:59,680
in ED, and I...

1519
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:01,450
I called them.

1520
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:07,020
I instantly regretted it,

1521
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:07,020
and I feel guilty even

1522
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:07,020
thinking about leaving.

1523
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:09,830
With all the changes

1524
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:09,830
that are going down

1525
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:09,830
in the ED

1526
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,840
and all this chatter

1527
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,840
about going for-profit...

1528
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:17,800
I have a bad feeling

1529
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:17,800
about the direction that

1530
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:17,800
Jack is taking us.

1531
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:19,640
I get your

1532
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:19,640
frustration, Maggie,

1533
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,680
and I promise you,

1534
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,680
we're working

1535
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:24,080
on a course-correction

1536
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:24,080
as we speak.

1537
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:27,590
The board is in the process

1538
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:27,590
of defeating Jack's agenda,

1539
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:29,880
and we're going to

1540
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:29,880
hold the line.

1541
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:31,960
Good.

1542
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,420
I really don't

1543
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,420
wanna leave Med.

1544
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,070
It's a great day

1545
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,070
for Gaffney, everybody.

1546
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:41,860
Thank you.

1547
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:43,870
I'm gonna make sure to have

1548
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:43,870
an even brighter future.

1549
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:46,130
Thank you.

1550
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,000
George?

1551
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,000
What's going on?

1552
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:52,110
Jack.

1553
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:54,540
He got the votes.

1554
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:57,880
We are now

1555
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:57,880
a for-profit hospital.

1556
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,010
How?

1557
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,110
Who flipped?

1558
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,690
Vernon!

1559
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:03,880
Apparently, he was

1560
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:03,880
so impressed with 2.0,

1561
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:07,150
he decided to be

1562
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:07,150
supportive of

1563
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:07,150
any measure

1564
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:11,660
that would bring in

1565
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:11,660
more advancement in

1566
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:11,660
high-tech medicine.

1567
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,130
Sharon, I am so sorry.
