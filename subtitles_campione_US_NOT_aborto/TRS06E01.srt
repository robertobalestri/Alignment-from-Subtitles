1
00:00:00,945 --> 00:00:03,765
- Previously on The Resident...
- It's multiple sclerosis.

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,326
You will get better.

3
00:00:05,331 --> 00:00:08,195
I actually want a child.
Would you give me

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,867
one of your eggs?

5
00:00:09,872 --> 00:00:12,716
You want me to be your sperm donor?

6
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:15,185
I don't like being alone.

7
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,315
I want to be a father.

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,549
Hi.

9
00:00:19,554 --> 00:00:21,351
I'm here to save my daughter's life.

10
00:00:21,356 --> 00:00:22,452
Who are you again?

11
00:00:22,457 --> 00:00:23,720
You only get one father.

12
00:00:23,725 --> 00:00:25,922
So, the two of you...

13
00:00:25,927 --> 00:00:27,023
Oh, we're friends.

14
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:28,625
We're also friends.

15
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:29,763
So far.

16
00:02:13,531 --> 00:02:16,162
Daddy! Daddy!

17
00:02:16,167 --> 00:02:17,834
I'm coming, sweetheart.

18
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,070
Daddy.

19
00:02:23,075 --> 00:02:24,841
It's okay. I'm here, honey.

20
00:02:28,413 --> 00:02:30,210
What's going on?

21
00:02:30,215 --> 00:02:33,513
There was a bad man. He scared me.

22
00:02:33,518 --> 00:02:36,549
There's no one here but me. Look. Look.

23
00:02:36,554 --> 00:02:38,750
See? See?

24
00:02:38,755 --> 00:02:41,856
It was just a dream, bad dream.

25
00:02:42,926 --> 00:02:44,956
He was going to hurt me.

26
00:02:44,961 --> 00:02:47,529
I won't let anyone hurt you.

27
00:02:48,332 --> 00:02:51,630
Can I sleep in your room tonight?

28
00:02:51,635 --> 00:02:54,800
I'll stay right here until
you go to sleep again.

29
00:02:54,805 --> 00:02:57,039
Please?

30
00:03:03,146 --> 00:03:06,281
Up you go.

31
00:03:10,821 --> 00:03:13,518
♪ The way you move is gonna
look like tax evasion ♪

32
00:03:13,523 --> 00:03:15,854
Look, we are all pretty
blessed here tonight,

33
00:03:15,859 --> 00:03:17,188
wouldn't we agree?

34
00:03:17,193 --> 00:03:18,657
- Yes.
- Yes.

35
00:03:19,997 --> 00:03:21,793
- Cheers.
- So, uh, which one of us

36
00:03:21,798 --> 00:03:23,495
has the most to celebrate?

37
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,797
- Uh, me.
- Me.

38
00:03:24,802 --> 00:03:26,732
Because I'm having twins.

39
00:03:26,737 --> 00:03:28,100
Perfect, healthy...

40
00:03:28,105 --> 00:03:31,403
ooh... hiccupping at this
very moment... baby boys.

41
00:03:31,408 --> 00:03:32,638
Hear, hear.

42
00:03:32,643 --> 00:03:34,240
- Identicals...
- Identicals rule the world.

43
00:03:34,244 --> 00:03:37,109
- Oh, yeah.
- But in second place,

44
00:03:37,114 --> 00:03:39,144
Devon's trial results just got published

45
00:03:39,149 --> 00:03:42,081
- in the New England Journal of Oncology.
- Ah.

46
00:03:42,086 --> 00:03:44,415
- Hey. Respect, man.
- Mm. - Aw, thank you.

47
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,117
Thank you. And not to brag,

48
00:03:46,122 --> 00:03:49,621
but I have a great clinical
trial about to come in, so...

49
00:03:49,626 --> 00:03:51,322
- Yeah. All good.
- Mm.

50
00:03:51,327 --> 00:03:53,257
Well, I don't mind taking third place.

51
00:03:53,262 --> 00:03:54,458
I just closed

52
00:03:54,463 --> 00:03:55,893
on the perfect condo

53
00:03:55,898 --> 00:03:57,329
for Padma and the babies.

54
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,396
And it's in a great school
district, I might add.

55
00:03:59,401 --> 00:04:02,066
- Nice.
- AJ is controlling five years out.

56
00:04:02,071 --> 00:04:04,301
- - Hear, hear.
- And Conrad

57
00:04:04,306 --> 00:04:06,838
finally has a new love at last.

58
00:04:06,843 --> 00:04:08,439
That is a big deal.

59
00:04:08,444 --> 00:04:09,674
And what about you?

60
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:12,043
Chastain's newest chief resident.

61
00:04:12,048 --> 00:04:13,478
We all know what that means.

62
00:04:13,482 --> 00:04:15,379
You are the most promising

63
00:04:15,384 --> 00:04:17,148
young surgeon at Chastain.

64
00:04:17,153 --> 00:04:22,152
The big news is I finally
have my own office

65
00:04:22,157 --> 00:04:24,420
with my own private shower.

66
00:04:24,425 --> 00:04:26,322
Oh. Which actually means I have

67
00:04:26,327 --> 00:04:28,393
the most to celebrate.- -

68
00:04:28,397 --> 00:04:30,127
Oh. Okay.

69
00:04:30,132 --> 00:04:32,529
Get a room.

70
00:04:32,534 --> 00:04:35,799
You know, after four boring
glasses of bubbly water, I think

71
00:04:35,804 --> 00:04:37,267
I will make a bathroom run.

72
00:04:37,272 --> 00:04:38,769
Oh, I'll come with.

73
00:04:40,308 --> 00:04:41,841
Whew.

74
00:04:42,311 --> 00:04:43,407
You okay?

75
00:04:43,412 --> 00:04:44,875
Um... whew.

76
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,646
I'm not sure.

77
00:04:47,415 --> 00:04:48,679
Woozy. I felt, uh...

78
00:04:48,684 --> 00:04:51,048
a little faint.

79
00:04:51,053 --> 00:04:52,148
Maybe I got up too fast.

80
00:04:52,153 --> 00:04:54,950
You know, that's been happening.

81
00:04:54,955 --> 00:04:56,519
Light-headed and...

82
00:04:56,524 --> 00:04:57,690
Padma!

83
00:05:25,586 --> 00:05:28,586
- Synced and corrected by<font color="#00BFFF"> Firefly</font> -
- <font color="#00ffff">www.addic7ed.com</font> -

84
00:05:30,691 --> 00:05:32,754
Devon, AJ,

85
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,289
don't you guys have work to do?

86
00:05:34,294 --> 00:05:36,124
I feel seriously stressed

87
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:37,593
with everyone hovering over me.

88
00:05:37,598 --> 00:05:39,628
Padma, you fainted.
Scared all of us to death.

89
00:05:39,633 --> 00:05:41,896
You should've let us take
you to the ER last night.

90
00:05:41,901 --> 00:05:43,098
I was dehydrated.

91
00:05:43,103 --> 00:05:45,334
Okay? It's fine. I feel fine today.

92
00:05:45,339 --> 00:05:46,537
- It was nothing.
- You said you were

93
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:47,903
still feeling light-headed.

94
00:05:51,578 --> 00:05:53,145
Go. You'll be late.

95
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,445
Devon is meeting Dr. Voss
in his new lab.

96
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:58,112
I want to stay.

97
00:05:58,117 --> 00:06:00,014
- Ugh.
- Three doctors

98
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:02,183
in the room is plenty.

99
00:06:02,188 --> 00:06:03,418
We've got this.

100
00:06:03,423 --> 00:06:05,322
Okay.

101
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:08,859
- Update me, okay?
- I will.

102
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,530
Ciara?

103
00:06:16,535 --> 00:06:18,499
Oh, Dr. Hawkins.
I'm so glad you're here.

104
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:21,101
- What have you done this time?
- Me? Nothing.

105
00:06:21,106 --> 00:06:22,670
I was viciously attacked.

106
00:06:22,675 --> 00:06:25,273
- By a vat of barbecue sauce.
- Let me see.

107
00:06:25,278 --> 00:06:27,708
- Who knew being head chef would be so dangerous?
- Yeah.

108
00:06:27,713 --> 00:06:29,809
Oh.

109
00:06:29,814 --> 00:06:31,244
That's a bad burn.

110
00:06:31,249 --> 00:06:33,513
- How's the hand healing?
- Finger's still sore.

111
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,850
Well, that's to be expected. You
almost cut the damn thing off.

112
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:38,451
So much for my samurai
knife skills, huh?

113
00:06:38,456 --> 00:06:40,654
Can you clean and dress Ciara's burn?

114
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:42,989
Hmm? Oh, sure thing.

115
00:06:42,994 --> 00:06:45,492
And, Hundley, give
our cooking queen here

116
00:06:45,497 --> 00:06:47,793
one gram of acetaminophen for the pain.

117
00:06:47,798 --> 00:06:49,295
Uh, Bay Four.

118
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,762
- Give me a minute.
- Yeah.

119
00:06:50,767 --> 00:06:52,731
Right this way.

120
00:06:52,736 --> 00:06:55,501
Hope you brought us some
of those buttermilk biscuits.

121
00:06:55,506 --> 00:06:57,836
With that fine honey butter.

122
00:06:57,841 --> 00:06:59,738
I didn't, but you know I will.

123
00:06:59,743 --> 00:07:01,407
As you know, Dr. Sullivan,

124
00:07:01,412 --> 00:07:04,677
pancreatic cancer is usually fatal.

125
00:07:04,682 --> 00:07:06,211
But your tumor was operable,

126
00:07:06,216 --> 00:07:07,546
your nodes were clear

127
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:10,115
and there's no evidence of metastasis.

128
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,450
But there could still be

129
00:07:11,455 --> 00:07:13,685
residual cancer cells
that no test can see.

130
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:17,122
Yes, but you've had postsurgical
chemo and radiation,

131
00:07:17,127 --> 00:07:19,425
uh, you haven't developed diabetes,

132
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,960
your weight is good, so I think

133
00:07:21,965 --> 00:07:24,062
that, for the foreseeable future,

134
00:07:24,067 --> 00:07:25,601
you're all clear.

135
00:07:26,636 --> 00:07:29,136
This couldn't be better news, Dad.

136
00:07:30,005 --> 00:07:32,203
You missed the best
reason I have for hope.

137
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:34,339
I have a great support system
right here.

138
00:07:34,344 --> 00:07:35,640
Well, there's nothing

139
00:07:35,645 --> 00:07:37,245
I can prescribe that's better than that.

140
00:07:38,381 --> 00:07:40,214
Thank you.

141
00:07:43,853 --> 00:07:45,717
I love your barbecue ribs,

142
00:07:45,722 --> 00:07:47,419
but they aren't worth this, Ciara.

143
00:07:47,423 --> 00:07:50,491
Best barbecue in all of Alabama.

144
00:07:51,227 --> 00:07:53,457
Atlanta. Unless you're opening up

145
00:07:53,462 --> 00:07:55,360
a new branch.

146
00:07:55,365 --> 00:07:56,630
Oh...

147
00:08:01,471 --> 00:08:03,768
- Thank you.
- There you go.

148
00:08:04,173 --> 00:08:05,502
Oh, I got to go.

149
00:08:05,507 --> 00:08:07,504
The lunch service won't wait for me.

150
00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:10,140
Whoa. Dr. Feldman just got started.

151
00:08:10,145 --> 00:08:11,678
That burn needs a lot more attention.

152
00:08:16,352 --> 00:08:18,515
- Ataxic gait.
- Slight confusion.

153
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,085
This is the second time
we've treated her in a month.

154
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:23,623
It's time we talk about why
she's so accident-prone.

155
00:08:25,327 --> 00:08:26,757
Sorry, my friend,

156
00:08:26,762 --> 00:08:28,893
but we have a few more things
to check out.

157
00:08:28,898 --> 00:08:30,427
What? Um...

158
00:08:30,432 --> 00:08:31,464
Let's go.

159
00:08:33,134 --> 00:08:35,165
We should get Billie on board
for a neuro exam.

160
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:36,703
Mm, that won't be necessary.

161
00:08:37,439 --> 00:08:39,202
Chefs have a high rate of addiction.

162
00:08:39,207 --> 00:08:41,070
We should start with a tox screen.

163
00:08:41,075 --> 00:08:42,342
Okay.

164
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,413
And this edema
in your legs... is this recent?

165
00:08:49,418 --> 00:08:51,047
No, but it has gotten worse,

166
00:08:51,052 --> 00:08:52,783
and she's been complaining of headaches.

167
00:08:52,788 --> 00:08:54,451
Maybe it's preeclampsia.

168
00:08:54,456 --> 00:08:55,985
- What's that?
- It's a, uh,

169
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:58,422
a condition during pregnancy
that requires monitoring,

170
00:08:58,427 --> 00:08:59,590
but it's manageable.

171
00:08:59,595 --> 00:09:01,225
Thank you, Dr. Austin,

172
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,760
but I'm gonna dig a bit deeper
before I make a diagnosis.

173
00:09:03,765 --> 00:09:05,932
Ah. Sure.

174
00:09:07,202 --> 00:09:09,399
Uh, I see you missed your
last prenatal appointment.

175
00:09:09,404 --> 00:09:10,667
You did what?

176
00:09:10,672 --> 00:09:12,001
Padma.

177
00:09:12,006 --> 00:09:14,203
I'm sorry, okay?

178
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,005
Oh, God, there's just
so many appointments,

179
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:18,241
and I didn't want the ultrasound.

180
00:09:18,246 --> 00:09:21,044
You know what, no one really
knows what those electronic

181
00:09:21,049 --> 00:09:23,579
vibrations or whatever
do to tiny brains, so...

182
00:09:23,584 --> 00:09:25,748
I'm going to be the bigger man right now

183
00:09:25,753 --> 00:09:27,883
and pretend my head is not exploding.

184
00:09:27,888 --> 00:09:29,986
Padma, you cannot

185
00:09:29,991 --> 00:09:32,121
miss any medical tests or appointments.

186
00:09:32,126 --> 00:09:33,823
Twin pregnancies
often have complications.

187
00:09:33,828 --> 00:09:35,959
It's dangerous for you and the babies.

188
00:09:35,964 --> 00:09:37,226
Let's take a look.

189
00:09:37,231 --> 00:09:40,733
I promise no brains will be harmed.

190
00:09:49,609 --> 00:09:51,206
Okay.

191
00:09:51,211 --> 00:09:52,975
Here's baby one.

192
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,676
Good size.

193
00:09:54,681 --> 00:09:56,945
Look, he's waving at you.

194
00:10:00,053 --> 00:10:01,583
And baby two

195
00:10:01,588 --> 00:10:04,252
is...

196
00:10:04,257 --> 00:10:05,623
... right here.

197
00:10:06,994 --> 00:10:08,123
One is...

198
00:10:08,128 --> 00:10:10,392
much bigger than the other.

199
00:10:10,397 --> 00:10:11,897
I can see that.

200
00:10:12,499 --> 00:10:13,596
What?

201
00:10:13,601 --> 00:10:15,963
That... that can't be right.

202
00:10:15,968 --> 00:10:17,732
It's fine. Deep breaths.

203
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,153
Their hearts don't sound the same.

204
00:10:37,456 --> 00:10:39,587
They're... they're identical.

205
00:10:39,592 --> 00:10:41,589
Their-their hearts should be identical.

206
00:10:41,594 --> 00:10:42,957
What's going on?

207
00:10:42,962 --> 00:10:46,027
I'm gonna go discuss this
ultrasound with Dr. Sullivan.

208
00:10:46,032 --> 00:10:47,998
- What?
- I'll be right back.

209
00:10:56,942 --> 00:10:58,805
Who's the president right now?

210
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:02,409
Um, I don't really follow
politics, to tell you the truth.

211
00:11:02,414 --> 00:11:04,578
I'm... I suffer from fragile sanity.

212
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,113
Eh, take a guess.

213
00:11:06,118 --> 00:11:08,715
Uh, I know it's not Jimmy Carter.

214
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,216
Do I get a point for that?

215
00:11:10,221 --> 00:11:11,618
No. No, I'm afraid not.

216
00:11:11,623 --> 00:11:15,388
Oh, um, I forgot to tell you, um...

217
00:11:15,393 --> 00:11:17,891
lately, I've had the memory
of a goldfish

218
00:11:17,896 --> 00:11:19,928
- with a drinking problem.
- Squeeze my hands. Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.

219
00:11:19,932 --> 00:11:22,295
And I've been chalking it up
to not getting any sleep.

220
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,897
- Do you have insomnia?
- No.

221
00:11:23,902 --> 00:11:26,502
I don't want to sleep
because of the nightmares.

222
00:11:27,973 --> 00:11:30,240
- What kind of nightmares?
- Uh...

223
00:11:31,242 --> 00:11:34,707
... usually I'm trapped

224
00:11:34,712 --> 00:11:36,509
in this water,

225
00:11:36,514 --> 00:11:38,311
no sound.

226
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:52,295
Why didn't you page me
for a consult sooner?

227
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,495
We were waiting for the
tox screen to come back.

228
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,845
Then Ciara decompensated rapidly.

229
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,814
It wasn't initially
clear it was neurological.

230
00:11:58,818 --> 00:11:59,948
Conrad thought it was.

231
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:02,520
It's my bad.

232
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,021
We've got this if you're
needed in the ER.

233
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:10,795
- I hate to go. Keep me posted?
- Yeah.

234
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:20,302
- How's Gigi?
- The same.

235
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:21,803
She had another nightmare.

236
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:23,895
- Oh. I'm worried.
- Me too.

237
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,030
I know when I was alone
with her on Saturday,

238
00:12:26,035 --> 00:12:27,699
she refused to nap.

239
00:12:27,704 --> 00:12:29,945
I tried to get her to talk
about the bad dreams

240
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,846
and what they're about,
but she wouldn't say.

241
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,849
Do you think this could
have anything to do

242
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:34,983
with Nic's death?

243
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:36,985
Yeah, maybe. It's possible.

244
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,355
But Gigi was a tiny baby
when Nic died. I mean,

245
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,090
she thinks of Nic as her guardian angel

246
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,992
- looking out for her.
- Yeah, but trauma

247
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:45,493
can take years to manifest.

248
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,496
I don't know any other reason
why she'd be afraid.

249
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:50,264
Yeah, I mean, you control
her screens and play dates.

250
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,833
Turn off the news.

251
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:53,504
I protect her with my life.

252
00:13:01,513 --> 00:13:03,010
- Conrad.
- This is brutal,

253
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:05,378
seeing her like this.

254
00:13:05,383 --> 00:13:10,050
I can't stop it. Can't help.

255
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:13,553
Fixing things like this is
supposed to be my job.

256
00:13:13,558 --> 00:13:16,126
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

257
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:22,595
You're a great dad and
a great diagnostician.

258
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,798
You'll get to the bottom of this.

259
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,669
Thank you.

260
00:13:29,974 --> 00:13:33,408
I don't know what I'd do
without your support.

261
00:13:38,783 --> 00:13:41,815
Okay, well, there's our problem.

262
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,549
Our talented chef has a mass
roughly the size of a marble

263
00:13:44,554 --> 00:13:46,885
located between the temporal
lobe and the cerebellum.

264
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:48,622
- Causing all her symptoms.
- Yeah, we're gonna

265
00:13:48,626 --> 00:13:50,422
have to operate
to figure out what it is.

266
00:13:50,426 --> 00:13:54,292
It's dangerously situated
near the brain stem.

267
00:13:54,297 --> 00:13:56,061
Let's get informed consent.

268
00:13:56,066 --> 00:13:57,299
Yeah.

269
00:14:05,809 --> 00:14:07,639
Thank you.

270
00:14:07,644 --> 00:14:11,242
Wow. You've all done an incredible job

271
00:14:11,247 --> 00:14:12,844
with the resources we have.

272
00:14:12,849 --> 00:14:14,945
Everybody has been working
around the clock

273
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:17,248
to meet our deadline
for the diabetes trial.

274
00:14:17,253 --> 00:14:18,849
Well, thank you.

275
00:14:18,854 --> 00:14:21,551
As you know, clinical trials
are crucial, not just

276
00:14:21,556 --> 00:14:23,888
for our patients, but for the
health of the hospital, too.

277
00:14:23,893 --> 00:14:25,957
And there's an election coming up.

278
00:14:25,962 --> 00:14:27,692
We may get a new governor who plans

279
00:14:27,697 --> 00:14:31,028
to slash our budget $200 million.

280
00:14:31,033 --> 00:14:33,831
Imagine voting for someone
who attacks health care.

281
00:14:33,836 --> 00:14:35,267
Yet he's polling to win.

282
00:14:35,272 --> 00:14:37,068
Well, the steady stream
of clinical trials...

283
00:14:37,473 --> 00:14:39,103
it'll help keep us solvent.

284
00:14:39,108 --> 00:14:41,005
I can't pretend I don't wish

285
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,508
we had the kind of facilities
other labs offer.

286
00:14:43,513 --> 00:14:46,578
Kit, I am confident in
what we created here,

287
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,545
and I know that we're gonna
get the job done.

288
00:14:50,319 --> 00:14:53,983
It's Lewis Varner
from Varner Scientific,

289
00:14:53,988 --> 00:14:56,552
- sponsor of our trial.
- Oh. Okay.

290
00:14:56,557 --> 00:15:00,090
I'm so glad you called, Lewis.
I have great news.

291
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:03,893
The lab is up and running,
and we can't wait to start.

292
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,601
Uh, Lewis, this is a mistake.

293
00:15:10,606 --> 00:15:13,270
Can we at least discuss it?

294
00:15:13,275 --> 00:15:15,772
I see. Well, thank you

295
00:15:15,777 --> 00:15:17,574
for letting me know in a timely fashion.

296
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:19,443
I-If anything changes,

297
00:15:19,448 --> 00:15:22,146
if there's anything
I can say or do, uh...

298
00:15:22,151 --> 00:15:24,817
Yes. I hear you.

299
00:15:26,287 --> 00:15:28,985
Well, good luck with everything.

300
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:31,020
What is it?

301
00:15:31,025 --> 00:15:34,390
For this trial, they've
decided to partner

302
00:15:34,395 --> 00:15:37,293
with Baltimore Advanced Sciences

303
00:15:37,298 --> 00:15:39,328
because of their superior facilities.

304
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,530
So they're cancelling our trial.

305
00:15:41,535 --> 00:15:44,533
Yes. There will be other trials, I hope.

306
00:15:44,538 --> 00:15:46,172
I-I'm sure.

307
00:15:47,075 --> 00:15:48,437
We have to talk about this later.

308
00:15:48,442 --> 00:15:49,973
I have to go. There's a

309
00:15:49,978 --> 00:15:52,175
problem with Padma's pregnancy.

310
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,609
Oh, no. What is it?

311
00:15:53,614 --> 00:15:55,381
I'm on my way to find out.

312
00:15:56,785 --> 00:15:59,814
The ultrasound is diagnostic,
there is no doubt,

313
00:15:59,819 --> 00:16:01,083
but I can help.

314
00:16:01,088 --> 00:16:03,986
Well, given how bad this is,
I'm having trouble handling it.

315
00:16:03,991 --> 00:16:06,054
And this is gonna be brutal for Padma.

316
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:07,422
She's quite fragile.

317
00:16:07,427 --> 00:16:09,391
You have to be careful how you tell her.

318
00:16:09,396 --> 00:16:11,193
Breaking the news is just the beginning.

319
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:13,896
I've done it many times.
You can trust me to handle it.

320
00:16:13,901 --> 00:16:16,165
- With your help.
- Hey.

321
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:18,801
I came as fast as I could.
What's happening?

322
00:16:18,806 --> 00:16:21,372
Dr. Sullivan is getting
ready to explain.

323
00:16:29,882 --> 00:16:32,980
Hi, Padma. I'm Dr. Ian Sullivan,

324
00:16:32,985 --> 00:16:36,383
a pediatric surgeon
specializing in fetal medicine.

325
00:16:36,388 --> 00:16:38,186
Oh, my God.

326
00:16:38,191 --> 00:16:40,387
Please don't let there
be anything wrong.

327
00:16:40,392 --> 00:16:44,325
Dr. Sullivan is an expert
in exactly what the twins need.

328
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,997
Tell me. What's happening?

329
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:52,566
Sometimes when babies
are growing in the womb,

330
00:16:52,571 --> 00:16:55,336
the process takes a wrong turn.

331
00:16:55,341 --> 00:16:57,171
And in the past, when this happened,

332
00:16:57,176 --> 00:16:59,974
we couldn't intervene
to help the babies.

333
00:16:59,979 --> 00:17:01,812
And, too often...

334
00:17:03,015 --> 00:17:05,011
... they would die
before they were born.

335
00:17:05,016 --> 00:17:07,681
- No. No.
- No, it's okay. Just let me finish.

336
00:17:07,686 --> 00:17:09,550
That was the past.

337
00:17:09,555 --> 00:17:12,386
Things are different now.
Your twins have

338
00:17:12,391 --> 00:17:15,421
something called twin-to-twin
transfusion syndrome.

339
00:17:15,426 --> 00:17:17,891
It only affects identical twins,

340
00:17:17,896 --> 00:17:20,793
because they... they share
the same placenta.

341
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:22,596
You see, what's happening

342
00:17:22,601 --> 00:17:24,831
is there are abnormal connections

343
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:25,866
between the blood vessels

344
00:17:25,871 --> 00:17:27,668
going from one twin to the other.

345
00:17:27,673 --> 00:17:30,003
So, blood is not flowing
evenly between them.

346
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:31,505
One twin... the larger one...

347
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:34,107
is getting too much blood, which
will cause his heart to fail.

348
00:17:34,112 --> 00:17:36,377
The heart of the other twin
is not getting enough blood,

349
00:17:36,382 --> 00:17:37,811
which is why he's so small.

350
00:17:37,816 --> 00:17:39,946
We have to use lasers

351
00:17:39,951 --> 00:17:43,183
to cut the blood vessels
linking the babies.

352
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:45,255
Like this.

353
00:17:46,157 --> 00:17:49,421
See? So they can each have
their own blood supply.

354
00:17:49,426 --> 00:17:51,691
And so the pregnancy can continue.

355
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,693
And if all goes well,

356
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:56,362
the babies will thrive
to be healthy kids,

357
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:59,332
and then, ultimately, healthy adults.

358
00:17:59,337 --> 00:18:02,135
You're making it sound simple,

359
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,270
- but I don't think it is.
- You're right. I have to

360
00:18:04,275 --> 00:18:06,273
tell you that no matter what we do,

361
00:18:06,278 --> 00:18:10,479
the smaller baby is in grave
danger and may not survive.

362
00:18:14,085 --> 00:18:17,315
I shouldn't have missed my
appointment. This is my fault.

363
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,484
There is no way that this is your fault.

364
00:18:19,489 --> 00:18:22,857
Most likely, no one would have
been able to see this earlier.

365
00:18:25,196 --> 00:18:27,193
Just do whatever you have to do.

366
00:18:27,198 --> 00:18:29,998
Please save my babies.

367
00:18:45,671 --> 00:18:47,701
Odds.

368
00:18:47,706 --> 00:18:51,371
There is an 80% chance
that the smaller twin will die.

369
00:18:51,376 --> 00:18:54,008
- And the larger baby?
- Fifty-fifty.

370
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:55,995
If we don't do the procedure,

371
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,830
it's certain that both twins will die.

372
00:18:57,835 --> 00:19:00,901
I didn't want to put too much
on the mom so soon,

373
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:03,506
but you're doctors,
you should know everything.

374
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:11,378
You've helped perfect
this procedure, correct?

375
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:12,913
Yes, I have.

376
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:14,881
And I've performed it many times.

377
00:19:15,386 --> 00:19:17,583
We're incredibly lucky
to have you here at Chastain.

378
00:19:17,588 --> 00:19:21,086
But the equipment
I need to do it isn't here.

379
00:19:21,091 --> 00:19:24,156
It requires very specialized tools.

380
00:19:24,161 --> 00:19:26,292
The closest fetal surgery center

381
00:19:26,297 --> 00:19:29,061
is in Orlando.

382
00:19:29,066 --> 00:19:31,663
We need to transfer Padma
as soon as possible,

383
00:19:31,668 --> 00:19:34,166
and the surgery will have
to be done by a doctor there.

384
00:19:34,171 --> 00:19:35,834
But we want you to do the surgery.

385
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:37,236
Well, and I would love to.

386
00:19:37,241 --> 00:19:40,706
I am incredibly frustrated
that I can't, but...

387
00:19:40,711 --> 00:19:43,575
public hospitals very rarely

388
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:46,612
have the capability to do fetal surgery.

389
00:19:46,617 --> 00:19:48,014
Let's focus on what we have to do.

390
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:50,349
- How quickly must this happen?
- As soon as possible.

391
00:19:50,354 --> 00:19:52,618
The smaller baby could die
within hours, and if that

392
00:19:52,623 --> 00:19:55,491
happens, the other twin will die too.

393
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,094
Okay, doctors, well then,
let's call Orlando right away.

394
00:20:01,064 --> 00:20:03,265
I'll get Kit to order a helicopter.

395
00:20:13,209 --> 00:20:15,643
A mass in my brain.

396
00:20:18,214 --> 00:20:21,645
My aunt's husband, uh,
died from glioblastoma.

397
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:24,218
It was... horrible.

398
00:20:25,121 --> 00:20:28,486
We don't know this is cancer,
much less a GBM.

399
00:20:28,491 --> 00:20:30,989
What else could it be?

400
00:20:30,994 --> 00:20:33,524
Dr. Sutton has to operate to find out.

401
00:20:33,529 --> 00:20:35,093
The surgery is dangerous

402
00:20:35,098 --> 00:20:37,295
with many possible complications.

403
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,733
- We need to go over them.
- No, I...

404
00:20:44,873 --> 00:20:47,405
I grew up homeless.

405
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,940
I never graduated high school.

406
00:20:49,945 --> 00:20:54,278
I apprenticed in kitchens,
and I learned my trade,

407
00:20:54,283 --> 00:20:58,115
and I won a James Beard Award at 28.

408
00:21:00,956 --> 00:21:03,354
I love my life,

409
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,559
and I will take any risk.

410
00:21:08,396 --> 00:21:10,059
You're a badass.

411
00:21:13,235 --> 00:21:16,099
- I've got to go.
- Let's book an OR.

412
00:21:16,104 --> 00:21:18,105
We'll be back.

413
00:21:25,513 --> 00:21:26,913
Hey.

414
00:21:30,885 --> 00:21:33,683
We can't stay long. I don't want
to leave Padma alone.

415
00:21:33,688 --> 00:21:34,818
She's not alone.

416
00:21:34,823 --> 00:21:36,843
I just paged Conrad.
He's gonna monitor her.

417
00:21:37,892 --> 00:21:39,326
Are you okay?

418
00:21:42,563 --> 00:21:45,227
My heart is breaking for her.

419
00:21:45,232 --> 00:21:47,730
I know. Poor AJ.

420
00:21:47,735 --> 00:21:49,833
So soon after he lost his mother.

421
00:21:49,838 --> 00:21:53,202
This is how life is.

422
00:21:53,207 --> 00:21:54,704
Everything's perfect,

423
00:21:54,709 --> 00:21:57,474
and you think you have it figured out...

424
00:21:57,479 --> 00:22:00,546
Just yesterday, we were all celebrating.

425
00:22:02,951 --> 00:22:04,613
The problems never stop coming,

426
00:22:04,618 --> 00:22:06,649
and we all have to live with that.

427
00:22:06,654 --> 00:22:09,618
But things are different for us now.

428
00:22:09,623 --> 00:22:11,290
We have each other.

429
00:22:13,594 --> 00:22:16,291
Yeah.

430
00:22:16,296 --> 00:22:18,530
And we always will.

431
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,697
What's the helicopter's ETA?

432
00:22:25,702 --> 00:22:28,533
Okay, we'll have the patient waiting.

433
00:22:28,538 --> 00:22:30,902
Half an hour. Orlando is prepared.

434
00:22:30,907 --> 00:22:32,303
Get Padma ready for transport.

435
00:22:32,308 --> 00:22:34,105
- I want to go with her.
- Of course.

436
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,174
I-I'll get someone
to cover your surgeries.

437
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:39,613
- You and Leela must both be there.
- Thank you.

438
00:22:51,093 --> 00:22:53,091
Hello, my dear.

439
00:22:53,096 --> 00:22:54,925
So, I have some good news.

440
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:57,527
They're trying me on a new
anti-CD20 antibody

441
00:22:57,532 --> 00:22:59,063
that's been shown to reduce
relapse rates,

442
00:22:59,067 --> 00:23:02,099
and so far, I'm tolerating it
really well.

443
00:23:02,104 --> 00:23:03,634
Oh, that's wonderful news.

444
00:23:03,639 --> 00:23:06,070
Bless your new doctors, Randolph,

445
00:23:06,075 --> 00:23:07,971
because I needed some good news.

446
00:23:07,976 --> 00:23:10,208
- What's wrong?
- Everything.

447
00:23:10,213 --> 00:23:12,776
Padma's twins have TTTS.

448
00:23:12,781 --> 00:23:13,944
Oh, my God.

449
00:23:13,949 --> 00:23:16,414
- So is Ian gonna operate?
- He can't.

450
00:23:16,419 --> 00:23:17,981
We have to send them out of state

451
00:23:17,986 --> 00:23:20,150
because we don't have
the right facilities here.

452
00:23:20,155 --> 00:23:21,884
Well, Chastain needs more funding

453
00:23:21,889 --> 00:23:24,021
- if it's gonna stay a first-class hospital.
- Yeah.

454
00:23:24,026 --> 00:23:25,888
And if this idiot becomes
our new governor,

455
00:23:25,893 --> 00:23:27,256
we'll have less than we ever had.

456
00:23:27,261 --> 00:23:28,558
He's polling ahead.

457
00:23:28,563 --> 00:23:30,794
It's just so hard being away from you.

458
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,529
I wish I was there to help.

459
00:23:32,534 --> 00:23:35,898
No. You're exactly where you need to be.

460
00:23:35,903 --> 00:23:38,735
You don't have to worry
about me or Chastain.

461
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:41,838
Just concentrate on
finishing the treatment.

462
00:23:41,843 --> 00:23:45,442
It's just, a few more months
just seems like forever.

463
00:23:45,447 --> 00:23:47,510
Hmm. But it'll be worth it.

464
00:23:47,515 --> 00:23:50,213
When you come back home
you'll be healthy and strong

465
00:23:50,218 --> 00:23:51,414
for our wedding.

466
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:53,082
I can't wait.

467
00:23:53,087 --> 00:23:54,520
Love you.

468
00:24:01,027 --> 00:24:03,158
I have to take a quick listen.

469
00:24:03,163 --> 00:24:05,661
It's hard... to breathe.

470
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:07,996
Try to stay calm.

471
00:24:08,001 --> 00:24:09,465
I'll give you some oxygen,

472
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:12,067
make you feel better, okay?

473
00:24:21,014 --> 00:24:22,214
Here we go.

474
00:24:31,057 --> 00:24:33,822
Better?

475
00:24:33,827 --> 00:24:36,191
You have fluid building up in your lungs

476
00:24:36,196 --> 00:24:37,592
and the rest of your body.

477
00:24:37,597 --> 00:24:40,128
Sometimes with TTTS,

478
00:24:40,133 --> 00:24:42,998
the mom starts mirroring
the symptoms of her babies.

479
00:24:43,003 --> 00:24:47,005
That's probably what caused you
too faint in the bar.

480
00:24:48,574 --> 00:24:50,005
Helicopter's here.

481
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:51,573
That's a good thing.

482
00:24:51,578 --> 00:24:53,645
She's mirroring.

483
00:25:03,055 --> 00:25:05,853
I'm sorry. They barely managed
to land safely.

484
00:25:05,858 --> 00:25:08,623
- Now they're grounded. They can't take off in this.
- What?

485
00:25:08,628 --> 00:25:10,992
It's okay. It's just a small delay.

486
00:25:10,997 --> 00:25:13,731
All right, we have to take her back.

487
00:25:17,402 --> 00:25:19,934
Padma can't afford to wait any longer.

488
00:25:19,939 --> 00:25:22,737
She's showing signs
of maternal mirror syndrome.

489
00:25:22,742 --> 00:25:24,272
Mom's life is now at risk, too?

490
00:25:24,277 --> 00:25:26,774
Surgery's the only way
to save Padma and the babies.

491
00:25:26,779 --> 00:25:28,042
We're out of time.

492
00:25:28,047 --> 00:25:30,314
We have to find a way
to do the surgery here.

493
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:40,375
- Devon.
- Hey. We're headed into the ICU.

494
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,995
Okay, good. I'll page Cade.

495
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,599
Have her meet us there.

496
00:25:44,895 --> 00:25:47,460
Kit. How can I help?

497
00:25:47,465 --> 00:25:49,795
Is there any way to do the surgery

498
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,031
- with what we have at Chastain?
- No.

499
00:25:52,036 --> 00:25:53,699
But when I saw the weather coming in,

500
00:25:53,704 --> 00:25:55,401
I-I made a few calls.

501
00:25:55,406 --> 00:25:57,970
Lundsford College of Medicine
is teaching surgical residents

502
00:25:57,975 --> 00:26:00,271
how to operate on fetuses
in their Sim lab.

503
00:26:00,276 --> 00:26:02,440
They may have the equipment we need.

504
00:26:02,445 --> 00:26:04,042
Bell's been teaching at Lundsford.

505
00:26:04,047 --> 00:26:06,314
I'll get him involved immediately.

506
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:22,728
What's going on?

507
00:26:22,733 --> 00:26:25,363
A lot. Can you get the
Lundsford College of Medicine

508
00:26:25,368 --> 00:26:27,368
to do us a favor?

509
00:26:30,373 --> 00:26:32,736
Blood pressure's spiking.

510
00:26:32,741 --> 00:26:35,695
- O2 sats are dropping.
- I'm scared.

511
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,464
The alarms...

512
00:26:37,469 --> 00:26:40,767
It's just telling us
your oxygen levels are low.

513
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,170
Hey, let's give 'em some space to work.

514
00:26:48,175 --> 00:26:49,206
We'll watch from outside.

515
00:26:49,211 --> 00:26:51,041
If she needs you, you're right here.

516
00:26:51,046 --> 00:26:53,427
- I'll be right outside, okay?
- Okay.

517
00:26:53,432 --> 00:26:55,895
The diuretic and blood pressure
meds will keep you stable

518
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,264
until we do the procedure.

519
00:26:57,269 --> 00:27:00,567
Are these medications safe for the baby?

520
00:27:00,572 --> 00:27:01,968
Absolutely.

521
00:27:01,973 --> 00:27:04,270
In fact, ten out of ten babies

522
00:27:04,275 --> 00:27:06,606
prefer blood pressure
to be lower than 140.

523
00:27:06,611 --> 00:27:09,508
It makes for more excellent
swimming conditions.

524
00:27:09,513 --> 00:27:11,377
Hey.

525
00:27:11,382 --> 00:27:12,911
Good news.

526
00:27:12,916 --> 00:27:14,913
Bell pulled some strings at Lundstrom.

527
00:27:14,918 --> 00:27:16,582
They're gonna send over the fetoscope

528
00:27:16,587 --> 00:27:19,218
and some minimally invasive
fetal surgery tools

529
00:27:19,223 --> 00:27:20,352
via police escort.

530
00:27:20,357 --> 00:27:22,154
So Ian will be able to do the surgery.

531
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,590
Okay, good. I'll go let
the OR circulating nurse know,

532
00:27:24,595 --> 00:27:26,193
make sure everyone's on deck and ready.

533
00:27:26,198 --> 00:27:27,597
All right.

534
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:30,996
- Hey, how's it going in here?
- Mm-hmm.

535
00:27:31,001 --> 00:27:32,598
How's her pedal edema?

536
00:27:32,603 --> 00:27:34,903
How much proteinuria is on her dip?

537
00:27:39,943 --> 00:27:42,974
You're not the doctor or surgeon
now, you're the father.

538
00:27:42,979 --> 00:27:45,244
Here to support the mom.

539
00:27:45,249 --> 00:27:48,346
Okay, well, in that capacity
is my next question.

540
00:27:48,351 --> 00:27:50,882
Should we wait for the weather to clear

541
00:27:50,887 --> 00:27:52,684
instead of trying
to jury-rig this thing?

542
00:27:52,689 --> 00:27:54,853
- No.
- There's no one else in this time zone

543
00:27:54,858 --> 00:27:57,859
more qualified to make this call. Look.

544
00:27:59,062 --> 00:28:01,960
He's done the science, had the outcomes.

545
00:28:01,965 --> 00:28:03,832
You're in the best hands.

546
00:28:09,472 --> 00:28:10,869
Thank you all for your high energy

547
00:28:10,874 --> 00:28:11,970
in the middle of the night.

548
00:28:11,975 --> 00:28:14,006
Well, we're honored
to be a part of Chastain's

549
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:15,674
first fetal procedure.

550
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,409
The fetoscope has arrived.

551
00:28:18,414 --> 00:28:20,378
Dr. Sullivan, are you confident

552
00:28:20,383 --> 00:28:23,714
you can make the GI tower
compatible with the fetoscope?

553
00:28:23,719 --> 00:28:25,550
Doing surgery in small spaces

554
00:28:25,555 --> 00:28:28,353
has made me a bit of an AV whiz.

555
00:28:28,358 --> 00:28:30,521
The light post is smaller,
but that just means

556
00:28:30,526 --> 00:28:31,724
we'll white balance ahead of time.

557
00:28:31,728 --> 00:28:33,925
And we'll-we'll pressure limit
the suction port

558
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:36,861
to account for the smaller
luminal diameter.

559
00:28:36,866 --> 00:28:38,629
The cavalry has arrived,

560
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:40,765
though I can already sense
there are way too many

561
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:42,768
advanced degrees in my OR.

562
00:28:42,773 --> 00:28:44,870
And it looks like we have more company.

563
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:47,105
Dr. Voss said the surgical
residents learning about

564
00:28:47,109 --> 00:28:48,873
fetal surgery at Lundsford
are going to watch

565
00:28:48,878 --> 00:28:52,510
the famous Dr. Sullivan
do his magic tricks.

566
00:28:52,515 --> 00:28:55,846
Ian, have you met
our night anesthesiologist?

567
00:28:55,851 --> 00:28:58,282
- Dr. Lee.
- Nice to meet you, Dr. Lee.

568
00:28:58,287 --> 00:29:01,085
Three lives in our hands
tonight. Pressure's on.

569
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:03,457
I'll go scrub in.

570
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:01,078
Hi, sweetheart.

571
00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:02,779
Hey, they're ready for you in the OR.

572
00:30:02,784 --> 00:30:05,782
Just getting my good glasses.
You gonna watch?

573
00:30:05,787 --> 00:30:08,521
- Oh, yes.
- Great. After you.

574
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,895
Can you see the mass yet?

575
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,630
Almost there.

576
00:30:25,635 --> 00:30:28,666
The tissue surrounding it
appears enflamed.

577
00:30:28,671 --> 00:30:30,638
Dissecting down carefully.

578
00:30:31,908 --> 00:30:34,806
Does it seem like a malignancy?

579
00:30:34,811 --> 00:30:36,377
Too soon to tell.

580
00:30:37,881 --> 00:30:39,748
All right, hold on, I feel it.

581
00:30:42,752 --> 00:30:44,018
That's odd, it's...

582
00:30:45,421 --> 00:30:47,188
It's encapsulated.

583
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,289
So, no glioblastoma.

584
00:30:52,294 --> 00:30:55,125
Could it be a teratoma?

585
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:57,230
No. I think...

586
00:31:00,803 --> 00:31:03,133
... it's an egg.

587
00:31:04,774 --> 00:31:06,306
That's not a tumor.

588
00:31:08,344 --> 00:31:10,045
Nope.

589
00:31:13,416 --> 00:31:15,580
A parasite.

590
00:31:15,585 --> 00:31:18,182
Which means our patient
is gonna be fine.

591
00:31:18,187 --> 00:31:21,552
That is such great news.

592
00:31:21,557 --> 00:31:23,153
I'm gonna go check on Padma.

593
00:31:23,158 --> 00:31:25,159
Okay, I'll join you when I'm done here.

594
00:31:32,033 --> 00:31:35,398
They haven't started yet.
Ian just got here.

595
00:31:35,403 --> 00:31:37,100
I heard he saved triplets once.

596
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:38,468
No one thought using a laser

597
00:31:38,472 --> 00:31:39,836
inside the uterus would work.

598
00:31:39,841 --> 00:31:43,540
He's a miracle worker.
Touched by the hands of God.

599
00:31:43,545 --> 00:31:45,579
All right, Padma.

600
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:51,618
Why don't you take your sister's hand.

601
00:31:54,856 --> 00:31:57,954
And why don't you hold my arm
with your other hand.

602
00:31:57,959 --> 00:32:00,028
All right?

603
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,000
If at any point you feel any pain,
you stop me. Okay?

604
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,367
Why don't we start with some Lidocaine.

605
00:32:14,777 --> 00:32:16,507
Okay.

606
00:32:16,512 --> 00:32:18,876
You're gonna feel some pressure now.

607
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:22,495
This is the tube through which

608
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:26,134
I will insert the fetoscope.

609
00:32:33,309 --> 00:32:35,406
Problem. Mom's BP is spiking again.

610
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:37,412
I'm nearly maxed out on nicardipine.

611
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:41,814
What's happening?

612
00:32:41,819 --> 00:32:44,149
Her mirror syndrome is getting worse.

613
00:32:44,154 --> 00:32:45,613
Do we need to stop?

614
00:32:45,618 --> 00:32:46,949
Yes. Take her back to the ICU.

615
00:32:46,953 --> 00:32:47,953
Her heart could fail.

616
00:32:47,958 --> 00:32:49,788
- We'll lose the twins.
- No!

617
00:32:49,793 --> 00:32:51,290
When the problem is the heart,

618
00:32:51,294 --> 00:32:52,756
you page Dr. Austin.

619
00:32:52,761 --> 00:32:54,625
Let's get IV furosemide hanging.

620
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:57,362
And I need an ultrasound wand.

621
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:05,269
AJ, please.

622
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:08,473
Don't want to die.

623
00:33:08,478 --> 00:33:10,842
Don't want babies...

624
00:33:10,847 --> 00:33:12,243
Padma, look at me.

625
00:33:12,248 --> 00:33:14,878
No one is dying today, you hear me?

626
00:33:14,883 --> 00:33:17,651
We're keeping all three of you alive.

627
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,685
He's just managing your pressures

628
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:23,321
so we can continue
with the procedure, okay?

629
00:33:23,326 --> 00:33:26,194
Right, and you should start
to feel better in a moment.

630
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,445
No, no, it's not working.
Her heart could still fail.

631
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:34,612
Another minute, Devi.

632
00:33:34,617 --> 00:33:36,380
I will not risk Padma's life,

633
00:33:36,385 --> 00:33:38,152
I promise you that.

634
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,766
We-we can't wait.

635
00:33:53,746 --> 00:33:55,976
Blood pressure's coming
back down to normal range.

636
00:33:55,981 --> 00:33:57,514
Of course it is.

637
00:33:59,665 --> 00:34:01,195
I can breathe.

638
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,863
Of course you can.

639
00:34:04,065 --> 00:34:05,795
You watch that heart like a hawk.

640
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,631
I'm gonna keep her stable, you just do

641
00:34:07,636 --> 00:34:09,703
what you need to do, all right?

642
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:13,956
You're doing great, Padma.

643
00:34:13,961 --> 00:34:16,358
Now, we're going to insert

644
00:34:16,363 --> 00:34:18,865
the fetoscope, okay?

645
00:34:21,002 --> 00:34:23,327
This will give us the best look

646
00:34:23,332 --> 00:34:24,995
we have of your babies.

647
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,063
Take a look at that monitor
to your left.

648
00:34:36,411 --> 00:34:39,108
140. Strong.

649
00:34:39,113 --> 00:34:41,047
That's the larger twin.

650
00:34:52,593 --> 00:34:54,426
You're losing him, Sullivan.

651
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,264
I'm now inserting the laser

652
00:35:02,269 --> 00:35:06,103
to burn the connecting blood vessels.

653
00:35:16,049 --> 00:35:18,648
The uterus is filling with blood.

654
00:35:18,653 --> 00:35:21,717
Bleeding upon entry with
the transplacental approach

655
00:35:21,722 --> 00:35:23,188
can happen.

656
00:35:24,257 --> 00:35:26,654
This is a known risk of the surgery.

657
00:35:26,659 --> 00:35:28,458
All that blood will
make it difficult to see.

658
00:35:28,462 --> 00:35:30,258
She's bleeding out.

659
00:35:30,263 --> 00:35:33,228
Heart rate's at 62. Can I have one liter

660
00:35:33,233 --> 00:35:34,862
of Lactated Ringer's, please?

661
00:35:34,867 --> 00:35:37,631
And infuse the uterus with fluid,

662
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:40,201
and clear the field.

663
00:35:40,206 --> 00:35:42,403
This is awful.

664
00:35:42,408 --> 00:35:45,039
Mother and twins are crashing.

665
00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:47,875
Come on.

666
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,480
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

667
00:35:58,825 --> 00:36:00,290
All clear.

668
00:36:01,694 --> 00:36:03,490
Now ablating

669
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:05,729
the remaining blood vessels.

670
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:12,766
Incredible.

671
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:15,169
He barely blinked.

672
00:36:15,174 --> 00:36:17,003
How did he do that?

673
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,243
I don't know.

674
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:32,418
And the smaller one's heart rate

675
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:34,220
is climbing to 103.

676
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:43,562
Ah...

677
00:36:43,567 --> 00:36:47,435
Yes! Yes! Yes!

678
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:52,742
You did great.

679
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:06,330
- Ian.
- Hey.

680
00:37:06,335 --> 00:37:07,631
I want to thank you.

681
00:37:07,636 --> 00:37:09,200
- You were masterful yesterday.
- Oh...

682
00:37:09,205 --> 00:37:11,502
Well, you have been every
day since I've hired you.

683
00:37:11,507 --> 00:37:12,970
You're too kind.

684
00:37:12,975 --> 00:37:14,772
No, it's the truth.

685
00:37:14,777 --> 00:37:16,841
You're a terrific addition
to the hospital.

686
00:37:16,846 --> 00:37:19,476
Well, Bell played a huge role,
even in absentia.

687
00:37:19,481 --> 00:37:21,678
Hard to believe
in the middle of his treatment

688
00:37:21,683 --> 00:37:24,115
in Minnesota, he was able
to score that equipment

689
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,482
we needed from Lundsford.

690
00:37:25,487 --> 00:37:27,584
Yeah, I wanted to discuss that with you.

691
00:37:27,589 --> 00:37:29,887
It's killing me that we don't
have what you need

692
00:37:29,892 --> 00:37:31,555
here at Chastain.

693
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,457
Everything goes back to Lundsford today,

694
00:37:33,462 --> 00:37:34,925
and we're right back where we started.

695
00:37:34,929 --> 00:37:37,294
Well, maybe I could help
raise some money

696
00:37:37,299 --> 00:37:39,829
so we could build an intrauterine

697
00:37:39,834 --> 00:37:41,398
surgical center of our own.

698
00:37:41,403 --> 00:37:42,932
That would be amazing.

699
00:37:42,937 --> 00:37:46,102
I have a pretty fair track
record at raising funds.

700
00:37:46,107 --> 00:37:50,574
- Grateful parents often become faithful donors.
- Dr. Sullivan,

701
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:52,208
you're needed in OR Three.

702
00:37:52,213 --> 00:37:55,379
- We'll talk later.
- Appendectomy on a teenager.

703
00:37:55,384 --> 00:37:56,580
There's no one else on call?

704
00:37:56,585 --> 00:37:58,715
I just finished that four-hour
biliary atresia.

705
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,917
I'm sorry, they tried,
but it's an emergency.

706
00:38:00,922 --> 00:38:02,955
- Be right there.
- Thank you.

707
00:38:30,819 --> 00:38:32,248
You see that?

708
00:38:32,253 --> 00:38:33,850
Steady as a rock.

709
00:38:33,855 --> 00:38:37,720
And Biden is president. And he won.

710
00:38:37,725 --> 00:38:40,424
The best news is you don't have cancer.

711
00:38:40,429 --> 00:38:42,993
- I had a cute little worm.
- Which you got

712
00:38:42,998 --> 00:38:45,028
from eating undercooked pork.

713
00:38:45,033 --> 00:38:47,097
I can't believe I did that.

714
00:38:47,102 --> 00:38:49,664
My kitchen test experiments
with undercooked sausage

715
00:38:49,669 --> 00:38:51,500
will not be repeated.

716
00:38:51,505 --> 00:38:53,435
Well, at least now

717
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,641
you have an unusual pet.

718
00:38:57,444 --> 00:38:59,274
I thought about naming him, but I think

719
00:38:59,279 --> 00:39:01,347
I'm just gonna flush
him down the toilet.

720
00:39:05,653 --> 00:39:07,249
How's Gigi?

721
00:39:07,254 --> 00:39:09,517
She had another nightmare last night.

722
00:39:09,522 --> 00:39:11,453
I'm so sorry.

723
00:39:11,458 --> 00:39:13,688
- Two nights in a row?
- Yep.

724
00:39:13,693 --> 00:39:15,257
I know a good child psychologist

725
00:39:15,262 --> 00:39:17,026
if you want to talk to someone
about how to handle this.

726
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,894
It may come to that, but I've been

727
00:39:18,899 --> 00:39:20,395
doing some reading.

728
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,632
First, there are a few things
I can try at home.

729
00:39:23,637 --> 00:39:25,333
Hey, you.

730
00:39:25,338 --> 00:39:28,170
Hey. Guess who got off early.

731
00:39:28,175 --> 00:39:29,904
I convinced Irving to take my shift.

732
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:32,640
Do you want to get Gigi
and go for some pizza?

733
00:39:32,645 --> 00:39:35,209
- Oh, Billie, you should come with.
- Yeah.

734
00:39:35,214 --> 00:39:37,879
You're so kind, but, uh,

735
00:39:37,884 --> 00:39:40,214
I have two more surgeries today.

736
00:39:40,219 --> 00:39:41,383
Have fun.

737
00:39:41,388 --> 00:39:43,818
All right. See you later.

738
00:39:43,823 --> 00:39:46,621
I can't go either. I got to
pick something up for Gigi

739
00:39:46,626 --> 00:39:48,689
and work on this nightmare situation.

740
00:39:48,694 --> 00:39:50,992
But I want to see you tonight.

741
00:39:50,997 --> 00:39:53,394
She goes to bed at 8:30. Come by after?

742
00:39:53,399 --> 00:39:56,700
- I'll bring the pizza.
- Mmm.

743
00:40:02,641 --> 00:40:04,372
Okay, so I don't get it.

744
00:40:04,377 --> 00:40:07,208
Why didn't you tell him
how you felt about him?

745
00:40:07,213 --> 00:40:08,776
- Maybe I did.
- No.

746
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:11,145
'Cause if you did, he would
be with you right now.

747
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,382
I doubt that.

748
00:40:13,152 --> 00:40:14,816
At Kit and Bell's engagement party,

749
00:40:14,821 --> 00:40:16,651
I had my speech prepared.

750
00:40:16,656 --> 00:40:18,887
Conrad left with Cade
before I could get a word out.

751
00:40:18,891 --> 00:40:22,723
Ah, that's painful.
You missed the moment.

752
00:40:22,728 --> 00:40:24,858
- But there's an upside.
- Yeah?

753
00:40:24,863 --> 00:40:26,927
Conrad and I are closer
than we've ever been.

754
00:40:26,932 --> 00:40:29,999
- Best friends.
- Ouch.

755
00:40:32,103 --> 00:40:33,199
My take.

756
00:40:33,204 --> 00:40:35,335
Conrad chose Cade

757
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,703
thinking you weren't interested

758
00:40:36,708 --> 00:40:38,672
because you were Nic's best friend.

759
00:40:38,677 --> 00:40:41,608
He figured that was a line
you wouldn't cross.

760
00:40:41,613 --> 00:40:43,277
And you allowed him to think that

761
00:40:43,282 --> 00:40:45,582
because you never crossed it.

762
00:40:47,253 --> 00:40:49,516
- Now it's too late.
- No.

763
00:40:49,521 --> 00:40:53,189
It's never too late to win
the love of your life back.

764
00:40:57,495 --> 00:41:01,028
It's dark out here, Daddy.

765
00:41:01,033 --> 00:41:02,729
Oh, I know.

766
00:41:02,734 --> 00:41:04,530
I want you to see something beautiful

767
00:41:04,535 --> 00:41:06,570
that you can only see in the dark.

768
00:41:15,013 --> 00:41:17,010
What kind of moon is it?

769
00:41:17,015 --> 00:41:19,916
- A crescent moon.
- Mm-hmm.

770
00:41:21,552 --> 00:41:23,850
It's beautiful, isn't it?

771
00:41:23,855 --> 00:41:26,019
Yes, Daddy.

772
00:41:29,928 --> 00:41:31,891
- You hear that owl?
- Yeah.

773
00:41:31,896 --> 00:41:34,426
Yeah, yeah. Owls love the dark.

774
00:41:34,431 --> 00:41:36,095
That's when they come out.

775
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,429
Aren't owls beautiful?

776
00:41:37,434 --> 00:41:40,032
I love owls.

777
00:41:40,037 --> 00:41:42,069
Yeah, there are so many
beautiful things in the dark.

778
00:41:42,073 --> 00:41:44,469
- What else is there?
- Stars?

779
00:41:44,474 --> 00:41:46,371
Ah, stars.

780
00:41:46,376 --> 00:41:48,877
Yeah, we love stars, right? What else?

781
00:41:51,015 --> 00:41:53,813
Can we read The Runaway Bunny?

782
00:41:53,818 --> 00:41:55,114
We can.

783
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:58,150
But I got you a new book.

784
00:41:58,155 --> 00:42:00,823
This one is called...

785
00:42:01,792 --> 00:42:05,724
... There's a Nightmare in My Closet.

786
00:42:05,729 --> 00:42:08,594
No, Daddy, that sounds scary.

787
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:11,529
Well, it's not. It's about
being brave at bedtime.

788
00:42:11,534 --> 00:42:14,802
Turns out the nightmare
isn't scary at all.

789
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:18,036
What do you say? You want to hear it?

790
00:42:18,041 --> 00:42:21,042
- Okay.
- Yeah, okay.

791
00:42:23,747 --> 00:42:26,914
Get in tight. Snuggle up.

792
00:42:28,952 --> 00:42:31,750
Okay, now I want you to go to sleep

793
00:42:31,755 --> 00:42:33,418
and have good dreams.

794
00:42:33,423 --> 00:42:35,019
I know you've had some bad ones,

795
00:42:35,024 --> 00:42:37,592
but that's over now.
You know you're safe.

796
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:42,393
There's nothing that can hurt you.

797
00:42:42,398 --> 00:42:45,997
I'll go to sleep if you stay with me.

798
00:42:46,002 --> 00:42:48,566
Okay, I will.
