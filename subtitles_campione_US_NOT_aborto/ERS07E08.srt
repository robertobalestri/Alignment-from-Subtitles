1
00:00:06,862 --> 00:00:09,030
E. R.

2
00:00:09,031 --> 00:00:10,258
Previously on E. R.

3
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:12,115
You can't throw me out.
I'm your mother.

4
00:00:12,116 --> 00:00:15,833
I'll keep taking my medication.
I won't be a burden.

5
00:00:15,834 --> 00:00:19,535
- We got some leaking fluid.
- It's just irrigation solution.

6
00:00:19,536 --> 00:00:21,545
- It's 10 to 6.
- I know.

7
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,226
I thought the procedure
had gone smoothly.

8
00:00:23,227 --> 00:00:26,113
Well, it was a screaming success
if your desired outcome was paralysis.

9
00:00:26,114 --> 00:00:28,431
Oh my God...

10
00:00:28,845 --> 00:00:31,071
I'm being sued for malpractice.

11
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:34,298
Get out! I don't want you here!
You stay away from my son!

12
00:00:34,906 --> 00:00:36,479
What's my prognosis?

13
00:00:37,224 --> 00:00:40,105
You need to talk to a neurosurgeon
right away.

14
00:00:50,326 --> 00:00:52,532
Hold on!

15
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:02,241
E. R. 7x08 "THE DANCE WE DO"

16
00:01:02,285 --> 00:01:03,826
All right!

17
00:01:03,994 --> 00:01:05,536
Coming.

18
00:01:08,063 --> 00:01:11,146
- Sorry. Did I wake you?
- Yeah, kind of.

19
00:01:11,315 --> 00:01:13,271
Dr. Kovac ordered breakfast.

20
00:01:21,447 --> 00:01:22,904
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:26,242 --> 00:01:28,399
- Have a good day.
- You too.

22
00:01:32,162 --> 00:01:37,321
- Sorry. I told him to leave it outside.
- That's okay. I had to get up.

23
00:01:37,499 --> 00:01:40,451
- Have some if you want.
- No, thanks.

24
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:44,003
You want to take a shower?
I'm almost done.

25
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,162
I have to stop home.

26
00:01:46,338 --> 00:01:48,331
- You working today?
- Yeah.

27
00:01:49,924 --> 00:01:52,841
- Are you?
- No, no.

28
00:01:57,763 --> 00:01:59,007
Okay.

29
00:02:03,183 --> 00:02:05,092
See you later, then.

30
00:02:10,688 --> 00:02:12,348
Morning.

31
00:02:12,981 --> 00:02:14,012
Morning.

32
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,190
- How was your night?
- What's all this?

33
00:02:17,859 --> 00:02:20,528
I borrowed the sewing machine
from Marge.

34
00:02:20,694 --> 00:02:21,892
Who's Marge?

35
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:26,481
Marge is your neighbor in 2A. An adorable
woman. I'll introduce you to her.

36
00:02:26,656 --> 00:02:28,365
Divorced.

37
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:31,486
- Coffee's fresh.
- Thanks.

38
00:02:33,036 --> 00:02:36,238
- You been up all night?
- No. I got up early just to finish this.

39
00:02:36,413 --> 00:02:38,535
I have a big interview today.

40
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:42,744
- Where'd you get all that fabric?
- Sale at the yardage store.

41
00:02:42,918 --> 00:02:46,617
And then I talked them
into a bit more of a discount.

42
00:02:46,795 --> 00:02:51,337
I used the money you gave me for
bus fare. I know it wasn't my money.

43
00:02:51,507 --> 00:02:56,083
I will pay you back when I get this job.
It's a fabulous place. Very high-end.

44
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,719
Big commissions.

45
00:02:57,887 --> 00:03:00,507
I'll buy us all-new furniture.

46
00:03:01,013 --> 00:03:05,259
There. Finished.
Tell me what you think.

47
00:03:05,433 --> 00:03:09,215
I copied it from something I saw in
a magazine. The skirt and everything.

48
00:03:09,395 --> 00:03:12,144
I shortened the jacket. I changed...

49
00:03:12,312 --> 00:03:15,763
- You don't like it.
- No, I do.

50
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,138
Do you?

51
00:03:18,317 --> 00:03:19,940
You know what I got you?

52
00:03:20,108 --> 00:03:24,935
Something great. Knit-jersey fabric.
I love the jersey. Where is it?

53
00:03:25,112 --> 00:03:28,695
I'm gonna make you something.
Make that Euro-doctor take notice.

54
00:03:28,866 --> 00:03:29,895
Euro-doctor?

55
00:03:30,074 --> 00:03:33,028
I've been here long enough
to know what's happening.

56
00:03:33,202 --> 00:03:36,237
He's very handsome but too old
to be playing hard to get.

57
00:03:36,412 --> 00:03:41,155
- Well, I thought I had him.
- You do. You just don't know you do.

58
00:03:41,332 --> 00:03:44,914
When you're not looking,
he stares at you all the time.

59
00:03:45,085 --> 00:03:48,748
Here it is! Come here.
Come here. Come here. Come here.

60
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:52,751
We're gonna make a wraparound dress
with a plunging neckline.

61
00:03:53,382 --> 00:03:54,756
There we go.

62
00:03:54,924 --> 00:03:57,544
- He stares at me?
- All the time.

63
00:03:57,718 --> 00:04:02,045
- I'm gonna take some measurements.
- No. I have to shower before work.

64
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,763
My interview isn't until noon.

65
00:04:03,931 --> 00:04:06,799
- Maybe we could have breakfast?
- Okay. If there's time.

66
00:04:06,973 --> 00:04:08,302
Well, hurry up.

67
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,109
Honey, have you got any-?

68
00:04:35,117 --> 00:04:36,943
What are you doing?

69
00:04:38,454 --> 00:04:40,244
Counting your pills.

70
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:41,693
- Why?
- Just checking.

71
00:04:41,871 --> 00:04:43,745
- I told you I'd take them.
- I know.

72
00:04:43,915 --> 00:04:46,203
Did I pass inspection?

73
00:04:47,292 --> 00:04:48,667
You taking any Prozac?

74
00:04:48,835 --> 00:04:52,119
I'm normal. I'm normal. I'm a little
nervous about this interview, but-

75
00:04:52,295 --> 00:04:54,287
- Prozac. Zoloft. Effexor.
- I gave them to you.

76
00:04:54,463 --> 00:04:55,626
- Did you get more?
- How?

77
00:04:55,798 --> 00:04:57,292
Mom!

78
00:04:57,466 --> 00:05:00,465
I told you. I promised you.
You don't believe me?

79
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,377
- Can you do me a favor?
- Anything.

80
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:03,927
Come to the hospital with me.

81
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,968
- What for?
- A blood test.

82
00:05:06,138 --> 00:05:08,427
- A blood test?
- Yes.

83
00:05:09,265 --> 00:05:14,638
- Would you do that for me?
- Sure. Sure, I'd do anything for you.

84
00:05:20,815 --> 00:05:22,937
E. R.

85
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:15,299
There was no epidural. I was the only
one remotely close to the dura.

86
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:18,393
- Answer the questions. You'll do fine.
- I had to have punctured it.

87
00:06:18,562 --> 00:06:21,099
It's a known risk.
It does not constitute negligence.

88
00:06:21,272 --> 00:06:22,646
Mark, missing a leak does.

89
00:06:22,814 --> 00:06:25,933
I don't even remember looking
before I removed the endoscope.

90
00:06:26,108 --> 00:06:29,524
You've done 100 of these. You know
the procedure. There was a bad outcome.

91
00:06:29,695 --> 00:06:34,235
They're looking for someone to blame.
It doesn't mean you did anything wrong.

92
00:06:35,615 --> 00:06:37,903
- Do you want me to ride with you?
- No, go to work.

93
00:06:38,075 --> 00:06:39,450
You sure?

94
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:42,901
Hey. Don't go jogging
into any more street signs.

95
00:06:43,078 --> 00:06:45,912
- Hard as a rock.
- Apparently not.

96
00:06:46,872 --> 00:06:50,702
- How long do these depositions last?
- Call me if it goes past midnight.

97
00:06:51,249 --> 00:06:53,741
- What?
- I'm just kidding.

98
00:06:59,172 --> 00:07:02,670
I hate to go on an interview
with a big Band-Aid on my arm.

99
00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:05,795
- What will they think?
- You have a suit jacket.

100
00:07:05,969 --> 00:07:10,961
Yeah. Yeah. Hope I don't have to take it
off if the room gets warm or something.

101
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,969
- Tell them you gave blood.
- Yeah. I don't wanna be late, though.

102
00:07:15,141 --> 00:07:17,713
Rule number one is,
do not be late for an interview.

103
00:07:17,893 --> 00:07:20,134
- This will just take a minute.
- I'd like to be early.

104
00:07:20,311 --> 00:07:22,932
What if I go and come back?
Then if you want to do this...

105
00:07:23,105 --> 00:07:25,062
Okay. Hold still.

106
00:07:25,231 --> 00:07:26,641
I just don't understand, Abby.

107
00:07:26,815 --> 00:07:29,732
I mean, you've let me in your home.
We're getting along so well.

108
00:07:29,901 --> 00:07:33,565
This is an absolute gift. I mean,
what will taking my blood accomplish?

109
00:07:33,737 --> 00:07:35,775
- Nothing, hopefully.
- Wait, stop. Stop. Stop.

110
00:07:35,946 --> 00:07:37,654
Listen to me, honey. Listen.

111
00:07:37,822 --> 00:07:40,230
When this test comes
back negative or positive...

112
00:07:40,408 --> 00:07:43,610
...or whatever it's supposed to be,
then you're gonna feel foolish...

113
00:07:43,784 --> 00:07:47,782
...and I'm gonna be hurt.
And then you're gonna feel bad.

114
00:07:48,121 --> 00:07:49,994
You can't touch
the vein after it's clean.

115
00:07:50,164 --> 00:07:51,955
- That can't be what you want!
- It's not.

116
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:55,040
Then, honey, let's just not do this!

117
00:07:56,251 --> 00:07:59,122
- Need some help in here?
- No, we're fine.

118
00:07:59,296 --> 00:08:02,295
- Hi, Dave.
- Hey. Hello, Mrs. Lockhart.

119
00:08:02,463 --> 00:08:06,543
- Oh, it's Wyczenski.
- Right. Right. Are you not feeling well?

120
00:08:06,717 --> 00:08:10,631
- No. Why, do I look sick?
- No, no. Actually, you look great.

121
00:08:10,804 --> 00:08:14,135
Thank you.
You look good too.

122
00:08:14,305 --> 00:08:17,508
Thank you. What's the draw for?

123
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,471
I'm giving blood.

124
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:27,313
- What? That's what you told me to say.
- Go. Just go. Go ahead.

125
00:08:27,482 --> 00:08:29,686
- What?
- Just go. I don't want you to be late.

126
00:08:29,857 --> 00:08:30,888
- Really?
- Yes.

127
00:08:31,066 --> 00:08:32,560
- Honestly?
- Yes.

128
00:08:32,734 --> 00:08:34,561
Sweetie, I love you.

129
00:08:34,736 --> 00:08:37,404
Okay. Thank you.

130
00:08:38,487 --> 00:08:40,943
- Bye, Dave.
- It's good to see you, Miss W.

131
00:08:41,115 --> 00:08:45,491
Miss W. I like that. Miss W.
I'll call you, let you know how it goes.

132
00:08:46,202 --> 00:08:47,612
Bye.

133
00:08:47,786 --> 00:08:49,694
Must be nice having such good genes.

134
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,112
Knowing that you're gonna
grow up looking like that.

135
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:53,866
You got a...

136
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:56,998
- Is this about a patient?
- No.

137
00:08:57,167 --> 00:08:58,542
- Bye, Randi.
- Hi, Maggie.

138
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,702
- Love that top!
- Thanks.

139
00:09:00,878 --> 00:09:05,787
- He's supposed to be working.
- Abby, have you seen Dr. Malucci?

140
00:09:05,964 --> 00:09:08,882
- He's around here somewhere.
- Tell him Stephanie stopped by.

141
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:12,252
- Your last name?
- He knows my last name.

142
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:16,219
I don't get it. He had some other
girl looking for him yesterday.

143
00:09:16,388 --> 00:09:18,510
Fire enough shots,
eventually you hit something.

144
00:09:18,681 --> 00:09:21,386
- Or catch something.
- Don't knock it until you try it.

145
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:22,839
What?

146
00:09:23,018 --> 00:09:25,389
Abby! A girl out here needs
help! She's bleeding!

147
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,802
Some kids, they
just threw her from a car.

148
00:09:32,734 --> 00:09:35,768
- Honey? Honey, here you are. Take this.
- What happened?

149
00:09:35,943 --> 00:09:38,232
- They hardly stopped the car.
- I'm okay.

150
00:09:38,404 --> 00:09:39,601
- No, you're not.
- Step back.

151
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:43,360
Okay. Let's sit down. Come on.
Careful. Okay, okay.

152
00:09:43,531 --> 00:09:44,942
- What's your name?
- Kynesha.

153
00:09:45,116 --> 00:09:47,072
Okay, Kynesha.
Lean back. Let me take a look.

154
00:09:47,242 --> 00:09:49,567
- Did someone beat you up?
- I fell.

155
00:09:49,744 --> 00:09:51,073
Nonsense. Honey, who did this?

156
00:09:51,245 --> 00:09:53,533
- Mom, go to your interview.
- I'm trying to help.

157
00:09:53,705 --> 00:09:55,364
We don't need your help. Go.

158
00:09:55,539 --> 00:09:58,908
Did you have a loss of consciousness?
Any trouble breathing?

159
00:09:59,084 --> 00:10:01,205
Get a gurney and page X-ray.

160
00:10:01,376 --> 00:10:03,001
Abby?

161
00:10:03,295 --> 00:10:05,037
Yeah.

162
00:10:05,213 --> 00:10:08,083
Mr. Resnik called from the garage.
He's on his way up now.

163
00:10:08,257 --> 00:10:09,750
Thank you.

164
00:10:11,758 --> 00:10:14,000
We'll wait five minutes,
and then we'll leave.

165
00:10:14,177 --> 00:10:16,086
I can stay.
I've taken the whole day off.

166
00:10:16,262 --> 00:10:18,751
We shouldn't have
to play these kind of games.

167
00:10:18,929 --> 00:10:21,005
- Gordy, good to see you.
- Bruce.

168
00:10:21,182 --> 00:10:24,632
Sorry to keep you waiting. There was
a pileup on the expressway. Real mess.

169
00:10:24,809 --> 00:10:26,683
- I'm sure.
- You must be Dr. Corday.

170
00:10:26,853 --> 00:10:29,140
- Bruce Resnik. Pleasure to meet you.
- And you.

171
00:10:30,354 --> 00:10:32,927
They didn't tell me
you were so stunning.

172
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,769
That's okay.
You don't have to respond.

173
00:10:36,941 --> 00:10:39,515
- Has the court reporter set up?
- In the library.

174
00:10:39,694 --> 00:10:41,104
Let's get going.

175
00:10:41,987 --> 00:10:43,779
After you.

176
00:10:50,285 --> 00:10:53,450
- Hey, Irene. How are you this morning?
- Fine, Mr. Resnik. Yourself?

177
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,110
- Can't complain. Hey, how are you?
- Fine, thank you.

178
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:58,909
Please have a seat.

179
00:10:59,082 --> 00:11:01,952
Ignore the camera. Thank you.

180
00:11:02,626 --> 00:11:05,294
Everyone was rubbernecking
past this accident.

181
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:09,410
I waited my turn. So, of course,
I take a look. You know, human nature.

182
00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:15,043
And these firemen are using
one of those big steel things to cut.

183
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:17,256
- What do you call them?
- Jaws of Life.

184
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:20,712
Jaws of Life! Right. I mean,
it looked pretty dangerous to me.

185
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,460
- You ever use one of those?
- No, not personally.

186
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:27,339
It was cutting into the car like
a can opener. Anyway, shall we start?

187
00:11:27,518 --> 00:11:28,548
Certainly.

188
00:11:28,727 --> 00:11:31,347
Please raise your right hand.

189
00:11:33,646 --> 00:11:35,768
- There's no Bible?
- No.

190
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,438
Do you swear to tell the truth
in this matter, so help you God?

191
00:11:39,609 --> 00:11:40,639
Yes.

192
00:11:40,817 --> 00:11:44,814
We are on the record in a deposition on
the behalf of the plaintiff, Al Patterson.

193
00:11:44,987 --> 00:11:47,739
Plaintiff's attorney's Bruce Resnik.
Gordon Price for defense.

194
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:50,194
Doctor, state and spell
your name for the record.

195
00:11:50,366 --> 00:11:53,282
Elizabeth Corday. C-O-R-D-A-Y.

196
00:11:53,451 --> 00:11:55,444
Doctor, how long
have you been a surgeon?

197
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,861
Including Residency?
Ten years.

198
00:11:58,038 --> 00:12:00,824
Have you ever had
a deposition taken before?

199
00:12:00,998 --> 00:12:04,697
- No, this is the first.
- After 10 years, that's pretty good.

200
00:12:04,876 --> 00:12:07,662
Well, only three have been in America.

201
00:12:07,836 --> 00:12:09,578
Touché.

202
00:12:10,337 --> 00:12:12,544
Extraocular movements are intact.

203
00:12:12,715 --> 00:12:16,497
Okay, Kynesha. We need to remove your
pants so I can check for injuries, okay?

204
00:12:16,674 --> 00:12:20,672
- It's just my face.
- I know, but we still need to check.

205
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,762
I'll be right back.

206
00:12:27,015 --> 00:12:29,340
- Hey, Peter.
- Hey.

207
00:12:29,517 --> 00:12:32,138
There's an inguinal hernia
in Curtain 3. Could you look?

208
00:12:32,311 --> 00:12:33,935
Yeah, after the assault victim.

209
00:12:34,104 --> 00:12:36,179
We've got it.
Probably just a facial fracture.

210
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:38,347
Well, I'll clear the belly.

211
00:12:38,523 --> 00:12:39,803
She's stable.

212
00:12:39,982 --> 00:12:43,185
There's blood in her underwear.
She says it's her period.

213
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,517
Get a rape kit.

214
00:12:45,819 --> 00:12:47,362
Peter, wait.

215
00:12:47,863 --> 00:12:50,021
You shouldn't take this one.

216
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,067
Why?

217
00:12:52,366 --> 00:12:53,943
It's Jesse's girlfriend.

218
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,818
I can take care of her.

219
00:12:59,955 --> 00:13:03,701
I'm gonna come in close
and check the back of your eyes.

220
00:13:03,873 --> 00:13:05,533
Let's take a look in your ears now.

221
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,036
Peter!

222
00:13:07,376 --> 00:13:09,166
Good. No hemotympanum.

223
00:13:09,335 --> 00:13:11,742
- What's that?
- That means you didn't crack your skull.

224
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,793
- I'm Dr. Benton.
- I know.

225
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:19,133
Is there anyone you want us to call?
Mother, father?

226
00:13:19,301 --> 00:13:21,588
She won't be home.

227
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:28,390
The re-enhancing lesion and central
necrosis on MRI was suspicious.

228
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,382
The biopsy confirms it.

229
00:13:31,558 --> 00:13:34,927
Another pathologist should take a look.
Could be an astrocytoma.

230
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:39,597
Two neuro specialists have reviewed
the slides independently. They concur.

231
00:13:39,772 --> 00:13:40,803
It's a GBM.

232
00:13:43,525 --> 00:13:45,398
What's the survival rate?

233
00:13:45,569 --> 00:13:47,228
Untreated, eight weeks.

234
00:13:47,403 --> 00:13:50,070
With radiation therapy, the average
increases six to nine months.

235
00:13:50,237 --> 00:13:53,154
So you need to go see
a radiation oncologist today.

236
00:13:53,323 --> 00:13:55,149
What about surgery?

237
00:13:55,658 --> 00:13:58,065
I'm afraid the tumor is inoperable.

238
00:13:58,868 --> 00:14:01,537
- Why?
- It looks like it invaded Broca's area.

239
00:14:01,703 --> 00:14:06,162
The speech arrest you were experiencing
was probably the result of a focal seizure.

240
00:14:06,331 --> 00:14:09,332
Even if we removed the entire tumor,
you'd most likely be left...

241
00:14:09,501 --> 00:14:13,627
...with the inability to speak
and understand language.

242
00:14:13,795 --> 00:14:15,704
- Communication.
- More than communication.

243
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,247
You'd lose all ability to comprehend,
interact with the world around you.

244
00:14:19,424 --> 00:14:21,915
Essentially, what makes you human.

245
00:14:22,093 --> 00:14:26,919
Even if you consented,
I wouldn't even consider operating.

246
00:14:30,598 --> 00:14:33,598
We'll keep you on Dilantin,
300 milligrams daily.

247
00:14:33,767 --> 00:14:36,054
Do you have disability insurance?

248
00:14:42,064 --> 00:14:43,094
Dr. Greene?

249
00:14:44,607 --> 00:14:45,852
Yeah.

250
00:14:51,945 --> 00:14:55,277
What's going on, Carter?
Why are we so backed up?

251
00:14:55,447 --> 00:14:56,563
I just got here.

252
00:14:56,741 --> 00:14:59,575
Weaver's not on till tonight.
This happens when she's off.

253
00:14:59,743 --> 00:15:03,241
- Hey, what happened to your head?
- Jogging. I ran into a street sign.

254
00:15:03,412 --> 00:15:04,822
She left you a note.

255
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:09,615
- Take the shoulder pain and the vertigo.
- Dr. Greene, guy with palpitations.

256
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:13,870
Tachycardic at 300.
BP is 100/70. Normal mentation.

257
00:15:14,044 --> 00:15:17,791
- Six of adenosine. I'll be right there.
- Did you say heart rate was 300?

258
00:15:17,963 --> 00:15:21,046
If it's Wolff-Parkinson-White,
adenosine could put him into V-fib.

259
00:15:21,215 --> 00:15:25,543
Yeah, right. 100 milligrams
procainamide. IV every 10 minutes.

260
00:15:25,719 --> 00:15:27,212
- Thanks, Carter.
- Sure. You okay?

261
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:29,543
Yeah. It's been a long morning.

262
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,294
Listen, we have to do
a blood and urine test on you.

263
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,548
- It's your three-month mark.
- Right now?

264
00:15:34,724 --> 00:15:37,130
- Sometime in the next six hours.
- Whenever.

265
00:15:37,308 --> 00:15:41,092
Listen, if you want privacy, I'll do the
stick. Otherwise, you can ask a nurse.

266
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,432
Yeah, I'll ask Abby.

267
00:15:42,604 --> 00:15:44,431
- Randi, what's open?
- Exam 1.

268
00:15:44,606 --> 00:15:45,980
Meet you there.

269
00:15:46,898 --> 00:15:50,267
Liver and spleen are good.
No peritoneal free fluid.

270
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:53,398
No lacerations or contusions.

271
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:55,728
Kynesha, when's the last time
you had intercourse?

272
00:15:55,905 --> 00:15:57,280
I don't remember.

273
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,698
Woods lamp.

274
00:15:59,865 --> 00:16:01,740
I'll get the lights.

275
00:16:06,536 --> 00:16:08,743
- What's that do?
- Hold on.

276
00:16:11,415 --> 00:16:13,076
- There's no semen.
- What?

277
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,084
We got some abrasions, but no stridor.

278
00:16:16,251 --> 00:16:19,003
I need to do a pelvic exam, Kynesha.
Do you know what that is?

279
00:16:19,171 --> 00:16:21,957
- No. I'm on my period. I told you.
- I still need to check.

280
00:16:22,131 --> 00:16:23,375
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Sit down.

281
00:16:23,548 --> 00:16:25,754
- Let me go!
- Come on. Calm down.

282
00:16:25,925 --> 00:16:28,415
Kynesha, it's important
we give you an exam.

283
00:16:28,593 --> 00:16:30,965
Not down there. Just fix my face.

284
00:16:31,137 --> 00:16:35,429
Look, we know it's hard, but if someone
sexually assaulted you, we have to check.

285
00:16:35,598 --> 00:16:38,385
I didn't get raped.
I got beat up. That's all.

286
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:41,593
- Who beat you up?
- I got jumped out. No big thing.

287
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:43,476
- Of a gang?
- I did okay.

288
00:16:43,645 --> 00:16:45,933
Some girls get real messed up.

289
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:47,764
I did okay.

290
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:56,523
So you concede Mr. Patterson's
surgery started at 5: 17 p. m.

291
00:16:56,696 --> 00:16:59,267
According to the chart, yes.

292
00:16:59,446 --> 00:17:03,111
And you sent Mr. Patterson
to Pre-Op at 2: 15 p. m.?

293
00:17:03,283 --> 00:17:06,782
- Approximately, yes.
- Expecting to operate within the hour?

294
00:17:06,953 --> 00:17:09,524
- Expecting to operate immediately.
- But you didn't.

295
00:17:09,704 --> 00:17:12,491
You didn't start the operation
for another three hours, did you?

296
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:13,945
- No.
- Why not?

297
00:17:14,124 --> 00:17:15,452
I'm on emergency call.

298
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:18,578
A life-threatening gunshot wound
to a 14-year-old boy came in.

299
00:17:18,752 --> 00:17:20,293
I had to respond.

300
00:17:20,461 --> 00:17:23,960
- And were you able to save this boy?
- No.

301
00:17:24,131 --> 00:17:26,798
And this Jesse Robbins...

302
00:17:27,966 --> 00:17:31,002
- Did you know him?
- By association, yes.

303
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:35,595
And that association was through
a colleague, Dr. Peter Benton?

304
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,637
- He was Dr. Benton's nephew.
- And Dr. Benton is your former lover?

305
00:17:39,807 --> 00:17:41,183
Don't answer that.

306
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:46,093
Was the boy you weren't able to save
the nephew of your former lover?

307
00:17:46,269 --> 00:17:50,017
Move it along, Bruce. That has no
probative value, and she's not answering.

308
00:17:50,189 --> 00:17:53,190
- Are you refusing to answer that-?
- She's not answering.

309
00:17:53,358 --> 00:17:56,311
Fine. She'll answer
in front of the judge.

310
00:17:57,486 --> 00:18:00,439
So the death of his nephew
was upsetting to you.

311
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:03,316
- Of course.
- How long did it upset you?

312
00:18:04,531 --> 00:18:05,812
I'm not sure.

313
00:18:05,992 --> 00:18:10,985
Losing a young boy, a boy you knew, a
boy close to someone you cared about...

314
00:18:11,163 --> 00:18:13,486
...it must have been
quite overwhelming.

315
00:18:13,663 --> 00:18:15,571
Is that a question?

316
00:18:16,749 --> 00:18:19,832
- Was it overwhelming?
- At that moment.

317
00:18:20,001 --> 00:18:22,835
So overwhelming and tragic
that it was still on your mind...

318
00:18:23,003 --> 00:18:25,410
...while you operated on my client.

319
00:18:25,588 --> 00:18:27,995
Wasn't it, Dr. Corday?

320
00:18:29,091 --> 00:18:33,335
Guess I should have had that
blood transfusion this morning, huh?

321
00:18:34,177 --> 00:18:37,130
Come on. That was funny.

322
00:18:38,472 --> 00:18:41,044
This is kind of ironic, isn't it?

323
00:18:42,307 --> 00:18:44,976
Check my cholesterol while you're at it?

324
00:18:45,684 --> 00:18:48,139
Hey, you!
You're supposed to be watching this.

325
00:18:48,311 --> 00:18:50,883
You think I want
to be doing this, Carter?

326
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:53,020
I don't have better things to do?

327
00:18:53,482 --> 00:18:56,316
- Okay. What should I do with this?
- Give it to me.

328
00:18:56,484 --> 00:18:58,392
- Are we done?
- Yeah.

329
00:18:58,568 --> 00:19:01,485
Abby, paramedics called.
Your mom's hurt. She's asking for you.

330
00:19:01,654 --> 00:19:03,028
- What happened?
- I don't know.

331
00:19:03,196 --> 00:19:05,687
She's outside a clothing store
on Oak Street.

332
00:19:07,282 --> 00:19:09,321
If she wants to give names,
I'll check it out.

333
00:19:09,493 --> 00:19:11,983
She's afraid.
She's not going to give names.

334
00:19:12,161 --> 00:19:14,781
Dr. Benton? She wants to talk to you.

335
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:17,705
If she changes her mind,
give me a call.

336
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,912
- Peter, I said I'd take care of her.
- I got it.

337
00:19:25,294 --> 00:19:27,832
Looks like you broke your cheekbone.

338
00:19:28,005 --> 00:19:30,874
Gonna have to do
a CAT scan of your face.

339
00:19:34,717 --> 00:19:37,207
So you're really gonna protect
the girls who did this?

340
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:41,763
I'm protecting myself. If they find out
I said something, they gonna kill me.

341
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:43,969
Like they did Jesse?

342
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,091
You don't know that.

343
00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:53,222
I know he wasn't
a gang member and you are.

344
00:19:53,396 --> 00:19:55,767
- Was.
- The only reason he was...

345
00:19:55,939 --> 00:19:58,395
...in that neighborhood
is because of you.

346
00:19:58,567 --> 00:20:01,103
He only came there twice.

347
00:20:02,193 --> 00:20:04,400
Said he didn't like me banging.

348
00:20:04,571 --> 00:20:07,903
Kept telling me that
I was better than all that.

349
00:20:08,323 --> 00:20:11,987
That he loved me.
He was gonna get me out.

350
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,076
You're telling me
that's why they killed him?

351
00:20:15,537 --> 00:20:20,244
He ditched school.
Tried to get me to come over.

352
00:20:21,582 --> 00:20:24,747
Told me that his mom
was gonna figure things out.

353
00:20:24,917 --> 00:20:27,076
We had a fight.

354
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:32,502
I was walking away...

355
00:20:32,673 --> 00:20:33,752
...when it happened.

356
00:20:33,924 --> 00:20:36,414
You saw who shot him?

357
00:20:36,592 --> 00:20:38,963
That's why I don't want to be
a part of it no more.

358
00:20:40,011 --> 00:20:41,469
I loved him too.

359
00:20:42,637 --> 00:20:44,926
Who shot him, Kynesha?

360
00:20:46,098 --> 00:20:48,137
You just said you loved him.

361
00:20:48,308 --> 00:20:50,633
- You'll tell the cops if I told you.
- No.

362
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:53,810
- Why you asking?
- Because I gotta know.

363
00:20:55,938 --> 00:21:00,230
- You swear you ain't gonna say nothing?
- Kynesha...

364
00:21:03,819 --> 00:21:05,774
Who murdered my nephew?

365
00:21:06,361 --> 00:21:08,603
- You need to hold still.
- My daughter is a doctor.

366
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,105
I don't need you to do any of this.
Don't touch me.

367
00:21:11,282 --> 00:21:13,606
She's a doctor.
She will be here. She can do this.

368
00:21:13,783 --> 00:21:16,238
Abby, this wasn't my fault.
This man came after me.

369
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,117
You her daughter?

370
00:21:18,286 --> 00:21:20,113
- She was shoplifting.
- I was not!

371
00:21:20,288 --> 00:21:22,161
Why would I shoplift
a $10 scarf?

372
00:21:22,331 --> 00:21:26,114
- It's a $300 scarf.
- Well, it looks like a $10 scarf!

373
00:21:26,292 --> 00:21:28,960
She ran straight into my door.
Shattered glass everywhere.

374
00:21:29,127 --> 00:21:31,961
You don't want to arrest her.
It's not worth it. I'm a nurse-

375
00:21:32,129 --> 00:21:34,500
- What's wrong with her?
- Nothing's wrong with me!

376
00:21:34,672 --> 00:21:36,961
- What's wrong with you?
- She has a mood disorder.

377
00:21:37,133 --> 00:21:39,670
- She was stealing.
- She wasn't stealing, she was confused.

378
00:21:39,843 --> 00:21:43,175
You weren't there. She walked into
the store, demanded a job. I explained-

379
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:47,009
Let me tell you something, dearie,
I have better retail skills than you!

380
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:49,008
Be quiet, Mom!

381
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:52,051
Common courtesy
and politeness being two of them!

382
00:21:52,225 --> 00:21:55,345
Can I give you my phone number,
and then I'll pay for the glass?

383
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,227
- Is that cool?
- What if she comes back?

384
00:21:57,396 --> 00:21:59,802
- I have customers in there.
- She won't come back.

385
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,973
- You'll take care of it?
- Yes, I promise.

386
00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:04,058
Fine! Just get her out of here!

387
00:22:05,318 --> 00:22:06,943
Up to 5 of Haldol, p. r.n.

388
00:22:07,111 --> 00:22:09,779
- You got it?
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

389
00:22:14,991 --> 00:22:18,240
- What? You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

390
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:21,161
Your naltrexone level
was nondetectable.

391
00:22:21,328 --> 00:22:24,495
- My naltrexone level?
- You're supposed to be on 50 mgs a day.

392
00:22:24,665 --> 00:22:28,031
I thought it was a drug screen. I didn't
know you were screening for naltrexone.

393
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:29,666
It's in your contract.

394
00:22:29,835 --> 00:22:32,585
My prescription ran out,
and I haven't had time to refill it.

395
00:22:32,753 --> 00:22:34,661
You know that
it's part of the agreement.

396
00:22:34,838 --> 00:22:39,130
And I'm taking it.
I don't need it, and I'm taking it.

397
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:40,329
What?

398
00:22:40,508 --> 00:22:42,833
You're not the only one
with something at stake here.

399
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:46,756
We put ourselves on the line
to give you a fresh start.

400
00:22:46,928 --> 00:22:49,550
In any other circumstance,
you'd either be dead or in jail.

401
00:22:49,723 --> 00:22:53,801
Fresh start, huh? You really
think this has been a fresh start?

402
00:22:54,392 --> 00:22:58,175
I think that I've done absolutely
everything that you've asked of me.

403
00:22:58,353 --> 00:23:00,013
And I've done it without complaint.

404
00:23:00,188 --> 00:23:04,100
I think that I've obeyed these arbitrary
and arcane rules and regulations...

405
00:23:04,273 --> 00:23:06,846
...about what patients I can treat
and what patients I can't.

406
00:23:07,026 --> 00:23:10,393
I think I've peed into cups.
I think you've taken my blood.

407
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:13,190
And I think at some point,
it's gonna have to be enough.

408
00:23:13,363 --> 00:23:18,024
I think at some point, you're
actually gonna have to trust me.

409
00:23:22,077 --> 00:23:23,737
Hey, Mark!

410
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:28,696
I need some help in here! Chuny,
get in here and get me some Ativan!

411
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:30,995
- Mark!
- Oh, my God! What happened?

412
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:32,281
- Get the Ativan.
- How much?

413
00:23:32,459 --> 00:23:34,250
Four milligrams now.
Mark.

414
00:23:34,418 --> 00:23:35,450
- Did he hit his head?
- No.

415
00:23:35,628 --> 00:23:38,960
- Does he have a fever?
- I don't know. He just started seizing.

416
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:40,754
Hold him still.

417
00:23:40,923 --> 00:23:43,674
All right.
Start him on 15 liters of O-2.

418
00:23:43,842 --> 00:23:48,134
Get a line going. And then
I need a pulse ox and a set of vitals.

419
00:23:48,303 --> 00:23:51,552
Get a tox screen.
Finger stick of glucose.

420
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,885
- What do you want for labs?
- CBC and a Chem-20.

421
00:23:57,058 --> 00:23:58,718
Carter?

422
00:23:58,894 --> 00:24:02,178
Dr. Greene? Hey, hey, Mark!
Can you hear me?

423
00:24:02,354 --> 00:24:04,892
- Squeeze my hands. Right and left.
- What happened?

424
00:24:05,065 --> 00:24:07,222
You had a seizure.
Your vitals have been stable.

425
00:24:07,399 --> 00:24:10,269
You didn't drop your sats.
We're gonna take you for a head CT.

426
00:24:10,443 --> 00:24:13,609
See if you can follow my finger with
your eyes. Come on. Just lay back.

427
00:24:13,779 --> 00:24:15,437
- No.
- We need to work this up.

428
00:24:15,612 --> 00:24:18,185
- I don't want to work it up.
- Neuro is coming for a consult.

429
00:24:18,365 --> 00:24:20,902
- It's not necessary.
- You had a new onset seizure.

430
00:24:21,075 --> 00:24:24,442
I just need a Dilantin level.
I can go to the outpatient lab.

431
00:24:24,619 --> 00:24:27,987
- Relax. I called Kovac in to cover.
- You've got a Hep-Lock on your arm.

432
00:24:28,163 --> 00:24:31,033
- I'll handle it. I'll handle it!
- Mark. Mark.

433
00:24:34,917 --> 00:24:37,917
- Dr. Greene, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

434
00:24:38,795 --> 00:24:41,464
Hey, boss, what are you doing?
I heard you had a seizure.

435
00:24:41,631 --> 00:24:43,669
Yeah? You heard wrong.

436
00:24:44,048 --> 00:24:48,128
Mr. Patterson's condition needed
immediate surgical attention, did it not?

437
00:24:48,302 --> 00:24:50,424
It depends on what
you mean by "immediate. "

438
00:24:50,595 --> 00:24:53,464
- You had to operate that day.
- Within the next 24 hours.

439
00:24:53,638 --> 00:24:56,555
The endoscopic surgery is certainly
the fastest procedure, correct?

440
00:24:56,723 --> 00:24:59,973
- Among other benefits.
- So it was more convenient for you.

441
00:25:00,143 --> 00:25:02,810
I base my surgical opinions
on what I perceive...

442
00:25:02,978 --> 00:25:05,136
...to be in the best
interests of the patient.

443
00:25:05,313 --> 00:25:07,139
- The recovery, how-
- Let me try again.

444
00:25:07,314 --> 00:25:11,310
Perhaps you didn't hear the question.
The endoscopic surgery was faster...

445
00:25:11,483 --> 00:25:14,732
...and easier on your schedule
than the alternate open procedure.

446
00:25:14,903 --> 00:25:16,313
- Of course, but-
- Thank you.

447
00:25:16,487 --> 00:25:18,859
How long does
the endoscopic procedure take?

448
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:22,813
My schedule had nothing whatsoever
to do with my advice to Mr. Patterson.

449
00:25:22,991 --> 00:25:24,983
Please strike that as nonresponsive.

450
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:29,950
Dr. Corday, how long does the
endoscopic procedure take to perform?

451
00:25:31,622 --> 00:25:32,820
About an hour.

452
00:25:33,624 --> 00:25:37,286
But you performed Mr. Patterson's
endoscopic discectomy in 42 minutes.

453
00:25:37,458 --> 00:25:38,490
Correct?

454
00:25:38,668 --> 00:25:40,909
I don't know.
I'd have to check the operative report.

455
00:25:41,087 --> 00:25:43,956
If the operative report
stated that you were in the O.R...

456
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:46,881
...less than 43 minutes,
would you say that's correct?

457
00:25:47,049 --> 00:25:48,079
It could be.

458
00:25:48,258 --> 00:25:52,385
Do you have any reason to doubt
the veracity of the operative report?

459
00:25:52,553 --> 00:25:53,584
No.

460
00:25:53,762 --> 00:25:56,881
Would it surprise you that
of the 87 endoscopic discectomies...

461
00:25:57,056 --> 00:26:01,218
...you performed before November 16,
your fastest time was 54 minutes?

462
00:26:01,392 --> 00:26:03,384
Twelve minutes slower
than Mr. Patterson.

463
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:06,228
- Objection. You're testifying, Bruce.
- It's a question.

464
00:26:06,395 --> 00:26:08,802
- She can count.
- Would that surprise you?

465
00:26:08,981 --> 00:26:10,011
Let's move on.

466
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:12,395
Did you know the fastest
you performed this procedure...

467
00:26:12,566 --> 00:26:16,349
...was 12 minutes slower
than Mr. Patterson's surgery?

468
00:26:16,527 --> 00:26:17,724
I do now.

469
00:26:18,236 --> 00:26:21,272
- You don't time yourself?
- It's not a race.

470
00:26:21,447 --> 00:26:24,233
Then why did the circulating
nurse remind you it was 10 to 6?

471
00:26:24,407 --> 00:26:26,399
Objection.
Assumes facts not in evidence.

472
00:26:26,576 --> 00:26:29,362
Do you recall the circulating
nurse reminding you that...

473
00:26:29,536 --> 00:26:32,370
...it was 10 to 6 while you were
operating on Mr. Patterson?

474
00:26:32,538 --> 00:26:34,695
- Yes.
- Why did you need to be reminded?

475
00:26:34,872 --> 00:26:36,247
To keep me on schedule.

476
00:26:36,415 --> 00:26:38,953
What did you have scheduled
after Mr. Patterson's surgery?

477
00:26:39,126 --> 00:26:40,370
I had an engagement.

478
00:26:40,543 --> 00:26:42,333
Someplace more important
you had to be?

479
00:26:42,502 --> 00:26:44,459
No, and I resent the inference.

480
00:26:44,629 --> 00:26:45,874
What inference is that?

481
00:26:46,047 --> 00:26:47,754
That I rushed Mr. Patterson's surgery...

482
00:26:47,923 --> 00:26:51,207
- ... to satisfy a personal obligation.
- That's it. We're taking a break.

483
00:26:51,383 --> 00:26:52,960
- Did you rush?
- Don't answer that.

484
00:26:53,134 --> 00:26:56,337
Did the nurse remind you of the time
because you needed to leave by 6?

485
00:26:56,512 --> 00:26:57,887
- Yes.
- We're taking a break.

486
00:26:58,055 --> 00:27:01,339
- Did you get that?
- We're off the record. Stop typing.

487
00:27:01,515 --> 00:27:03,673
Now, I said we're taking a break.

488
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,344
Let's go.

489
00:27:09,062 --> 00:27:13,225
All I wanted to do was talk to the owner.
If I talked to him, I knew he'd hire me.

490
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:16,601
- What happened?
- I don't know.

491
00:27:17,734 --> 00:27:20,403
- Dr. Greene had a seizure?
- Yeah.

492
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:23,320
I've never understood people
who make themselves feel big...

493
00:27:23,488 --> 00:27:27,733
...by making other people feel small.
Let me tell you. I've got experience.

494
00:27:27,907 --> 00:27:30,399
- Sit down. Sit down.
- You know what? She was threatened.

495
00:27:30,577 --> 00:27:32,403
She knew I could outsell her.
She knew it.

496
00:27:32,578 --> 00:27:35,779
So she sent that Neanderthal in on me.
You know why? She was threatened.

497
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:37,235
Did you even have an interview?

498
00:27:37,414 --> 00:27:41,031
Of course I had an interview.
Until she chased me into the window.

499
00:27:42,251 --> 00:27:44,871
- God, this is bad! This is bad.
- You need stitches.

500
00:27:45,044 --> 00:27:48,744
Here. Sit down. We'll get an x-ray
and make sure there's no glass in it.

501
00:27:48,922 --> 00:27:52,965
- Keep pressure on it. I'll be right back.
- All right. Abby. Abby.

502
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,004
- You're mad at me.
- No, Mom, I'm not mad at you.

503
00:27:57,177 --> 00:27:59,715
- I thought you would be mad.
- Sit down.

504
00:28:02,098 --> 00:28:07,303
I have plenty of experience.
Plenty of experience.

505
00:28:07,476 --> 00:28:11,307
Do you think I'm gonna
put up with that? Well, I'm not.

506
00:28:11,479 --> 00:28:13,554
I'm not gonna put up with that.

507
00:28:15,231 --> 00:28:17,104
See if I don't.

508
00:28:17,274 --> 00:28:19,432
I hate people like that.

509
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,431
I have so much
more experience than you.

510
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:24,437
I don't think
she's gonna say anything.

511
00:28:24,613 --> 00:28:26,604
It seems like
she wants us to get this girl.

512
00:28:26,781 --> 00:28:28,903
I gave you the name.
Why don't you pick the girl up?

513
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:30,781
We have to get it from her.

514
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,444
What if she doesn't say anything?

515
00:28:33,618 --> 00:28:36,619
Depends.
We can bring in the D.A., maybe a judge.

516
00:28:36,788 --> 00:28:40,237
There's fluid in the maxillary sinus.
No depressed fracture.

517
00:28:40,414 --> 00:28:41,908
Good. Good.

518
00:28:42,082 --> 00:28:45,331
Kynesha, there are a couple of guys
out here that need to talk to you.

519
00:28:45,501 --> 00:28:50,742
No! No way!
I told you I don't know nothing!

520
00:28:57,258 --> 00:29:00,793
- Looks like you're feeling better.
- Yeah.

521
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:04,636
I got my prescription refilled.
Do you want to see me take it?

522
00:29:06,308 --> 00:29:08,133
Thanks for helping me out.

523
00:29:08,308 --> 00:29:10,633
Sure. You want
to tell me what happened?

524
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:12,968
Not particularly.

525
00:29:13,145 --> 00:29:16,513
You know, I did treat you.
Technically, I am your doctor.

526
00:29:16,689 --> 00:29:19,605
Anything you tell me is confidential.

527
00:29:22,318 --> 00:29:24,357
Okay, doctor.

528
00:29:24,652 --> 00:29:26,727
It's quite simple.

529
00:29:28,029 --> 00:29:30,650
I have a brain tumor.

530
00:29:30,823 --> 00:29:34,487
- What?
- Glioblastoma multiforme.

531
00:29:35,451 --> 00:29:36,826
Bummer, huh?

532
00:29:36,994 --> 00:29:40,576
Gets better.
I found out that it's inoperable.

533
00:29:42,997 --> 00:29:48,239
- Mark. I'm sorry.
- Yeah. Well...

534
00:29:48,418 --> 00:29:49,449
You're up.

535
00:29:49,627 --> 00:29:51,667
What are you gonna do?

536
00:29:51,921 --> 00:29:53,912
Die, I guess.

537
00:29:55,006 --> 00:29:59,583
After today, I probably won't
be able to work anymore, so...

538
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,545
- Did you get a second opinion?
- They double-checked the biopsy.

539
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:04,178
No, by another neurosurgeon.

540
00:30:04,346 --> 00:30:07,262
There's gotta be a clinical trial
going on someplace.

541
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:09,471
Yeah. Looking into it.

542
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,133
Looks like they need you.

543
00:30:15,144 --> 00:30:17,386
Are you gonna be okay?

544
00:30:18,022 --> 00:30:20,689
Stupid question, Carter.

545
00:30:20,856 --> 00:30:22,101
Do me a favor.

546
00:30:22,274 --> 00:30:26,484
Try and keep the rumors from spreading
before I get a chance to talk to Elizabeth.

547
00:30:26,652 --> 00:30:27,732
Sure.

548
00:30:39,494 --> 00:30:43,193
- Do you know what time it is?
-2:47.

549
00:30:43,371 --> 00:30:46,537
- Correct, but it's not the right answer.
- It's not?

550
00:30:46,707 --> 00:30:49,742
No, the right answer is "yes" or "no. "

551
00:30:49,917 --> 00:30:52,704
Yes or no when possible.
Don't elaborate.

552
00:30:52,878 --> 00:30:54,704
Not all questions
have a yes or no answer.

553
00:30:54,879 --> 00:30:59,207
I understand. Yes or no
when possible. Don't elaborate.

554
00:30:59,382 --> 00:31:01,872
We don't win cases in deposition,
but we can lose them.

555
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:05,003
At best, this stain follows you
for the rest of your career.

556
00:31:05,177 --> 00:31:07,549
At worst, you lose your license.

557
00:31:07,721 --> 00:31:10,472
We're not here to win an argument.
This is about information.

558
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,391
He's looking to gain information
to use against you in court.

559
00:31:13,558 --> 00:31:16,891
We're looking to limit that information.

560
00:31:17,394 --> 00:31:19,635
You mean hide the truth.

561
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:21,888
I didn't say that.

562
00:31:25,566 --> 00:31:28,401
How many do you think? Stitches?

563
00:31:28,569 --> 00:31:32,232
- Four. Five.
- Five?

564
00:31:32,404 --> 00:31:36,649
You're so good at this.
You're so gentle.

565
00:31:37,867 --> 00:31:38,898
Thank you.

566
00:31:39,076 --> 00:31:44,709
It's hard to believe because you
have such great, big, masculine hands.

567
00:31:46,956 --> 00:31:49,078
Sit still. Don't move.
Don't move. Don't move.

568
00:31:49,249 --> 00:31:52,083
Eyelash. See?

569
00:31:52,251 --> 00:31:55,500
Okay, now you have
to make a wish and blow.

570
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:57,413
That's all right.

571
00:31:57,588 --> 00:32:00,753
Okay.
I'll blow for you.

572
00:32:02,424 --> 00:32:06,006
What did you wish for? Don't tell me.
Don't tell me. Don't tell me.

573
00:32:06,177 --> 00:32:09,046
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry for what?

574
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,844
It's part of the disease.

575
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:18,891
Yes. We're going to now apologize for
your diseased mother, are we? Are we?

576
00:32:19,061 --> 00:32:22,558
She's always misbehaving. Abby never
wanted me around her friends.

577
00:32:22,729 --> 00:32:24,306
- She was always ashamed.
- Stop it.

578
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,596
Ashamed and embarrassed.

579
00:32:25,774 --> 00:32:27,765
- You think I don't know?
- Let him finish your hand.

580
00:32:27,941 --> 00:32:30,609
You would walk right by me
and pretend you didn't know me.

581
00:32:30,777 --> 00:32:34,026
- You'd pretend I didn't exist.
- Let him finish your hand and shut up!

582
00:32:34,196 --> 00:32:36,270
- Don't sass me! I'm your mother!
- Not by choice.

583
00:32:37,573 --> 00:32:41,355
Okay. All right. Okay!
Do you want a 5 of Haldol?

584
00:32:41,533 --> 00:32:45,150
- No! Abby, I'm sorry! Abby, I'm sorry.
- Do you want 5 of Haldol?

585
00:32:45,327 --> 00:32:48,743
- I don't want Haldol!
- Behave, and we won't give you anything.

586
00:32:48,914 --> 00:32:51,783
Don't! You let me go!
I'm leaving! I'm leaving!

587
00:32:51,957 --> 00:32:55,041
I'm leaving! I'm leaving! I'm leaving!

588
00:32:55,209 --> 00:32:57,415
I am leaving!

589
00:32:57,586 --> 00:32:59,044
No! No!

590
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:07,961
- You want a 5 of Haldol?
- Get restraints, stat! Start an IV!

591
00:33:08,135 --> 00:33:12,629
Abby! Abby! Abby, no!
Don't let them do this to me! Abby!

592
00:33:12,804 --> 00:33:14,962
- Don't let them...
- Starting a line with saline.

593
00:33:15,139 --> 00:33:17,297
Here! Arm restraints!

594
00:33:17,975 --> 00:33:20,181
Okay, call Psych.
Put her on the monitor.

595
00:33:20,894 --> 00:33:24,937
Please! Please don't let them
do this, Abby!

596
00:33:25,105 --> 00:33:28,638
- Come on, Maggie. Calm down.
- No!

597
00:33:30,733 --> 00:33:36,402
- Maggie! Maggie!
- Don't! Don't!

598
00:33:37,321 --> 00:33:41,531
You're my daughter, you little bitch!
Make them stop!

599
00:33:49,662 --> 00:33:53,611
They're ready to start again.
You okay? You look a little peaked.

600
00:33:53,791 --> 00:33:54,953
I'm fine.

601
00:33:55,125 --> 00:33:56,535
We're getting to the critical stage.

602
00:33:56,709 --> 00:33:58,866
If you don't feel you can
maintain your composure-

603
00:33:59,043 --> 00:34:03,289
- No. No, I want to get this over with.
- Okay.

604
00:34:11,052 --> 00:34:13,258
- What's he doing here?
- It's his deposition.

605
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:17,128
He has a right to be here, like you
have a right to be at our depositions.

606
00:34:17,306 --> 00:34:19,878
- Don't they have to tell us?
- He's here to rattle you.

607
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:23,841
- Just stay calm. Pretend he's not there.
- Pretend he's not there.

608
00:34:24,019 --> 00:34:26,390
- Don't let it affect your testimony.
- Ready to start?

609
00:34:26,562 --> 00:34:28,638
Yes. Okay?

610
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,782
You removed the restraints?

611
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:49,816
I can admit her voluntarily, but she
doesn't meet the criteria for a hold.

612
00:34:49,994 --> 00:34:53,825
- She ran through a plate-glass window.
- An accident. She's not gravely disabled.

613
00:34:53,997 --> 00:34:56,404
- Not a danger to herself or others.
- That's debatable.

614
00:34:56,582 --> 00:35:00,033
She's rapid-cycling. Probably
experiencing a drug-induced mania.

615
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:03,874
- Blood alcohol's 0.092.
- Well, that'll do it.

616
00:35:04,046 --> 00:35:06,084
So do you want me to admit her?

617
00:35:07,047 --> 00:35:09,882
- I don't care.
- Okay, I'll do it.

618
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,840
She wants to talk to you.
She's remorseful.

619
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:14,131
- She wants to apologize.
- No, thank you.

620
00:35:14,302 --> 00:35:15,713
Okay.

621
00:35:16,304 --> 00:35:18,047
- Abby, I'm sorry.
- Hey, Maggie...

622
00:35:18,222 --> 00:35:20,972
- I'll go in the hospital. I'll get better.
- Go back inside.

623
00:35:21,139 --> 00:35:22,848
- Back to bed.
- I'll get better.

624
00:35:22,916 --> 00:35:27,917
- It's all right. It's all right.
- I'll get better. I'll get better.

625
00:35:32,272 --> 00:35:36,565
Get some frozen peas. Reuse them every
four hours on your face for 20 minutes.

626
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:38,891
You can take some
ibuprofen for the pain.

627
00:35:39,068 --> 00:35:42,935
I want you to come back for a recheck.

628
00:35:43,113 --> 00:35:46,860
Hey, he was my nephew.
You knew I had to do something.

629
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,078
LOL, complains of weakness...

630
00:35:54,246 --> 00:35:56,699
- Yeah. Good luck.
- ... while under a hair dryer.

631
00:35:56,871 --> 00:35:59,742
Ma'am, were you having
any chest pain or shortness of breath?

632
00:35:59,916 --> 00:36:02,287
No, dear.
The dryer was just set too high.

633
00:36:02,459 --> 00:36:04,783
Okay. EKG, CBC, Chem-7
and get a chest.

634
00:36:04,961 --> 00:36:07,877
- I'll be right with you, Mrs. Fruhman.
- Thank you, dear.

635
00:36:08,379 --> 00:36:11,463
They think they're gonna find
the shooters who killed Jesse.

636
00:36:11,632 --> 00:36:13,671
Good. I hope it helps.

637
00:36:15,927 --> 00:36:17,124
Yeah. Cleo...

638
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:22,919
I got angry, you know?
And I got you angry.

639
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:26,466
You're the only thing in my life
that makes sense right now.

640
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:32,310
You know, I'm trying to say
I'm, you know, sorry.

641
00:36:32,479 --> 00:36:37,186
Buy me some dinner.
I'll consider your apology.

642
00:36:37,357 --> 00:36:40,691
Well, then in your medical opinion,
what caused the meningocele...

643
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:44,477
...that cut off the blood supply
to Mr. Patterson's spinal cord?

644
00:36:44,654 --> 00:36:49,276
A leak of CSF, cerebrospinal fluid
from the dura,

645
00:36:49,311 --> 00:36:51,086
which covers the spinal canal.

646
00:36:51,158 --> 00:36:55,155
Which means you must have punctured
the dura during the procedure.

647
00:36:55,328 --> 00:36:57,616
That seems evident now, yes.

648
00:36:57,788 --> 00:37:01,072
- It wasn't evident during the procedure?
- No.

649
00:37:01,248 --> 00:37:04,996
- It was evident to the anesthesiologist.
- Objection. Argumentative.

650
00:37:05,168 --> 00:37:10,326
According to the operative report,
Dr. Babcock, the anesthesiologist...

651
00:37:10,504 --> 00:37:15,130
...drew your attention to spinal fluid
in the surgical field at 10 to 6.

652
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,126
- Correct?
- No.

653
00:37:18,676 --> 00:37:21,842
- The note says 10 to 6, doesn't it?
- Yes.

654
00:37:22,012 --> 00:37:27,634
- So the report is wrong?
- No. He did draw my attention to fluid.

655
00:37:27,808 --> 00:37:31,176
- Fluid we now know to be spinal fluid.
- No.

656
00:37:31,352 --> 00:37:35,099
- What could it have been, doctor?
- Saline.

657
00:37:35,271 --> 00:37:40,181
But you understood the anesthesiologist
was concerned it might be spinal fluid?

658
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:41,389
Yes.

659
00:37:41,567 --> 00:37:45,017
How did you satisfy
yourself that it wasn't?

660
00:37:45,194 --> 00:37:50,696
I suctioned the irrigation saline
and did not see any persistent CSF.

661
00:37:51,366 --> 00:37:52,528
Did you look?

662
00:37:53,742 --> 00:37:55,533
I can't operate without looking.

663
00:37:55,702 --> 00:37:59,365
Well, given that it was 10 to 6,
that you were in a hurry...

664
00:37:59,537 --> 00:38:02,206
...the nurse simultaneously
reminding you of your date-

665
00:38:02,373 --> 00:38:04,530
Objection. Can we get
to a question, Bruce?

666
00:38:04,707 --> 00:38:07,957
Did you perform a complete and
competent inspection of the field...

667
00:38:08,127 --> 00:38:11,625
...to ensure there were no CSF leaks?

668
00:38:15,423 --> 00:38:19,171
Sometimes leaks are so small
you cannot detect them visually.

669
00:38:19,343 --> 00:38:22,342
Nevertheless, did you perform
a thorough inspection?

670
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,541
That's procedure.

671
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,804
And you followed procedure
by performing a thorough inspection?

672
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:28,514
Objection. Asked and answered.

673
00:38:28,682 --> 00:38:30,839
It's been asked.
It has not been answered.

674
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,047
What was the question?

675
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:35,344
Did you perform a thorough
and competent inspection...

676
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:40,061
...specifically looking for possible
CSF leaks before you closed?

677
00:38:45,735 --> 00:38:47,394
Yes.

678
00:38:53,365 --> 00:38:56,899
- Where did you go? I was looking for you.
- I took a walk. Got a cup of coffee.

679
00:38:57,076 --> 00:38:59,648
- You didn't get my page?
- I knew what it was about.

680
00:38:59,828 --> 00:39:03,160
Legaspi was trying to find a bed
for your mom, and she just took off.

681
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:04,989
I figured. Thanks.

682
00:39:05,164 --> 00:39:06,872
Thought you'd want
to check your apartment-

683
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,071
She's not there.

684
00:39:08,792 --> 00:39:13,168
- You checked?
- No. This is the end of the cycle.

685
00:39:13,337 --> 00:39:14,961
Our cycle. She disappears.

686
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:16,955
And for months,
I don't know where she is...

687
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:19,004
...or what she's doing
or if she's alive.

688
00:39:19,174 --> 00:39:23,123
And then eventually, she'll turn up
somewhere, and I'll have to deal with it.

689
00:39:23,302 --> 00:39:26,301
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

690
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:29,257
I knew how it would end
when she showed up.

691
00:39:31,933 --> 00:39:33,806
It's the dance we do.

692
00:39:33,974 --> 00:39:37,841
You get lost in it for a little while,
but it always ends the same.

693
00:39:39,104 --> 00:39:41,346
- Do you-?
- You ready?

694
00:39:41,523 --> 00:39:42,602
Yeah.

695
00:39:42,773 --> 00:39:46,722
Carter, I forgot to tell Weaver enzymes
are pending on Mr. Albe in 4.

696
00:39:46,901 --> 00:39:48,893
- I'll tell her.
- Thanks.

697
00:39:49,069 --> 00:39:50,183
Good night, Carter.

698
00:40:01,827 --> 00:40:04,781
- You coming in?
- I don't want to intrude.

699
00:40:04,955 --> 00:40:07,907
They're probably just eating.
Jackie makes so much food anyway.

700
00:40:08,207 --> 00:40:11,123
They need some time to themselves.
I'll wait for an invitation.

701
00:40:11,292 --> 00:40:14,624
All right. I'll just grab some stuff
for tomorrow. I'll be right back.

702
00:40:15,795 --> 00:40:17,787
Dr. Benton.

703
00:40:17,964 --> 00:40:19,374
What are you doing here?

704
00:40:19,547 --> 00:40:22,085
- I went to the store, like you said.
- Jackie see you?

705
00:40:22,258 --> 00:40:23,289
- No.
- You can't be here.

706
00:40:23,467 --> 00:40:26,420
The cops was hooking up the cousins.
They gonna think it was me!

707
00:40:26,594 --> 00:40:30,175
- Have you been home yet?
- No. They're gonna kill me! I'm dead!

708
00:40:30,346 --> 00:40:33,595
- Come on. Get in the car.
- I talked to the cops. I can't go home.

709
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:37,975
- I told you this was gonna happen.
- Get in the car. I'll figure out something.

710
00:40:43,105 --> 00:40:44,895
Mark?

711
00:40:45,064 --> 00:40:46,973
I'm up here.

712
00:40:51,986 --> 00:40:55,270
- What are you doing?
- Just thinking.

713
00:40:56,696 --> 00:40:58,191
How did it go?

714
00:40:59,324 --> 00:41:01,150
Terribly.

715
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:02,985
What happened?

716
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:14,489
What? What is it?

717
00:41:17,419 --> 00:41:18,450
I lied.

718
00:41:19,462 --> 00:41:21,336
I lied.

719
00:41:23,506 --> 00:41:25,463
The fact is, I rushed.

720
00:41:25,633 --> 00:41:30,009
I rushed through and didn't inspect
the entire surgical field.

721
00:41:30,678 --> 00:41:32,503
That man will never walk again...

722
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:36,379
...because I wanted
to get out early for the weekend.

723
00:41:36,557 --> 00:41:40,175
And I couldn't
even claim responsibility.

724
00:41:42,644 --> 00:41:48,597
I sat there, and I swore to God,
and I lied to save myself.

725
00:41:55,027 --> 00:41:56,855
God owes us one.

726
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:05,698
I think you're allowed
to be selfish for a while.

727
00:42:25,048 --> 00:42:28,000
I didn't run into a street sign.

728
00:42:32,678 --> 00:42:34,338
I had a biopsy.

729
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:46,334
Those headaches weren't from hockey.
