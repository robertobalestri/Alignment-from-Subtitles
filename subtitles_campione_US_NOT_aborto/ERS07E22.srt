1
00:00:06,867 --> 00:00:09,231
E. R.

2
00:00:09,232 --> 00:00:10,436
Previously on E. R.

3
00:00:10,437 --> 00:00:12,393
We had something.

4
00:00:14,444 --> 00:00:16,856
- Are you his mother?
- Neighbour. He's a friend of my son's.

5
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:19,948
- Any way to contact the parents?
- He just has a father. I left a message.

6
00:00:19,983 --> 00:00:23,066
We found some unusual bruising
on your son, Mr. Fossen.

7
00:00:23,167 --> 00:00:24,890
- Do you know about that?
- No.

8
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:27,701
I'm afraid Ben's gonna have to stay
here for a few days, Mr. Fossen.

9
00:00:27,702 --> 00:00:30,557
What?
You're not doing this to us!

10
00:00:30,558 --> 00:00:33,025
- No! Dad! Please!
- You bastard!

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,078
Please!

12
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,442
You're returning my application?

13
00:00:35,443 --> 00:00:38,539
Did you honestly think
that you'd make the first cut?

14
00:00:40,606 --> 00:00:43,439
E. R. 7x22 "RAMPAGE"

15
00:01:02,804 --> 00:01:04,595
How'd she do?

16
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:08,973
Up from 3:30 to 6.
Then she wanted to feed at 7.

17
00:01:09,141 --> 00:01:11,927
Lie down. Take a nap.

18
00:01:13,935 --> 00:01:16,508
- Are you leaving?
- Yeah.

19
00:01:16,812 --> 00:01:18,851
Please don't go.

20
00:01:19,022 --> 00:01:20,894
I have to.

21
00:01:29,278 --> 00:01:31,648
I want you to stay.

22
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,859
So do I.

23
00:01:35,114 --> 00:01:37,070
Can't you call in sick?

24
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,323
- I wish I could.
- Just do it.

25
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:55,453
I'll leave the van.

26
00:02:09,551 --> 00:02:11,341
What was that?

27
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:14,545
It's 8:00. They're demolishing
the old textile building on State.

28
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,712
That'll wake you up.

29
00:02:27,061 --> 00:02:30,642
Exactly our problem. They blow up
a manufacturing plant to build a mall.

30
00:02:30,813 --> 00:02:32,769
What's wrong with a mall?

31
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,553
Fifty cents.

32
00:02:34,732 --> 00:02:37,897
All we do is buy and sell.
We don't produce nothing.

33
00:02:38,067 --> 00:02:39,892
See? What do you do?

34
00:02:40,067 --> 00:02:42,024
- What?
- For a living?

35
00:02:42,194 --> 00:02:44,815
- I'm a doctor.
- Okay. Bad example.

36
00:02:44,988 --> 00:02:46,979
What are you talking about?
You're building the mall.

37
00:02:47,156 --> 00:02:48,566
Not for long.

38
00:02:56,994 --> 00:02:59,566
Mark Ainsley, 12 years old.
GSW through the upper left arm.

39
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,987
- Is the neuro-circ still intact?
- Complains of pain and paresthesia.

40
00:03:02,164 --> 00:03:03,622
- Can you squeeze my hand?
- It hurts.

41
00:03:03,789 --> 00:03:06,280
- What happened?
- Open fire in a foster-care facility.

42
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:07,738
- Foster care?
- Twelve down.

43
00:03:07,918 --> 00:03:09,576
- Can you feel this?
- A little.

44
00:03:09,751 --> 00:03:11,660
- Think about a vascular study.
- Got it.

45
00:03:11,836 --> 00:03:14,540
Mark! Mark! Take that one. Go!

46
00:03:16,172 --> 00:03:19,088
- It's still in me. It still hurts.
- We're gonna help you out.

47
00:03:19,257 --> 00:03:21,925
Entrance wound only.
Palpable in the sub-Q. Got this, Dave?

48
00:03:22,092 --> 00:03:23,834
As long as there's no
compartment syndrome.

49
00:03:24,009 --> 00:03:26,132
- I can't breathe.
- Slow your breathing down.

50
00:03:26,303 --> 00:03:28,591
Maria Fredrikkson,
with significant blood loss.

51
00:03:28,763 --> 00:03:31,512
BP, 90/palp. Tachy at 120.

52
00:03:31,681 --> 00:03:34,253
- Any belly pain, ma'am?
- No. My leg is cold.

53
00:03:34,432 --> 00:03:36,590
- Foot pulses are diminished.
- Did they get him?

54
00:03:36,767 --> 00:03:38,676
- Who?
- The man with the gun.

55
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:41,970
- I don't know. Did you see him?
- We were hiding in a closet.

56
00:03:42,145 --> 00:03:45,928
- But he just shot through the door.
- Foot is pale. Poor capillary refill.

57
00:03:46,106 --> 00:03:48,726
- Trauma 1, coming through!
- Who's on for Trauma?

58
00:03:48,899 --> 00:03:52,433
- We're bringing everybody in!
- Two more of saline, order pre-op labs.

59
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:55,181
- Doesn't she have an ischemic leg?
- Get through to Surgery!

60
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,277
- We have an 8-year-old girl in arrest.
- Where was she hit?

61
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:01,813
Shot in the head. Intubated.
Bradyed down to 30, then lost her pulse.

62
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:04,277
- Pupils fixed and dilated.
- P.E.A. Let's get her epi.

63
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:06,488
You just get here? Nice way to start.

64
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:09,030
Well, I was gonna call in sick.

65
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:12,569
E. R.

66
00:05:00,273 --> 00:05:03,521
Dr. Weaver, gluteal gunshot wound.
He needs a cystourethrogram.

67
00:05:03,691 --> 00:05:06,098
- Try a rigid sigmoidoscopy.
- He should see a surgeon.

68
00:05:06,276 --> 00:05:08,352
Yeah, get in line. Where's Benton?

69
00:05:08,528 --> 00:05:10,519
- Charge to 60.
- You getting a rhythm?

70
00:05:10,695 --> 00:05:13,529
Degenerated into V-fib. Clear.

71
00:05:14,532 --> 00:05:17,317
Another 120.
Looks like brain-stem failure.

72
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:20,905
104's on the radio with the last one.
GSW to the chest.

73
00:05:21,077 --> 00:05:22,535
- Is he hypotensive?
- No change.

74
00:05:22,703 --> 00:05:23,781
-120 again.
- No.

75
00:05:23,953 --> 00:05:26,241
- Fine. Bring him in.
- Is it the same gunman?

76
00:05:26,413 --> 00:05:28,903
Yeah. He shot the gardener
on his way out.

77
00:05:29,165 --> 00:05:30,539
Clear.

78
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:34,789
- Surprised he had any bullets left.
- Push another. 3 of epi.

79
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,449
- Want to try mannitol?
- Couldn't hurt. 30 grams.

80
00:05:37,627 --> 00:05:41,077
- Do you need an angiogram?
- No, I don't think so. No bruit or thrill.

81
00:05:41,964 --> 00:05:43,422
Is that Helen?

82
00:05:43,589 --> 00:05:45,416
- Who?
- Helen. She's new.

83
00:05:45,591 --> 00:05:48,127
Foster-mom bailed on her.

84
00:05:48,718 --> 00:05:50,259
I don't know.

85
00:05:50,885 --> 00:05:53,091
- Clear!
- Expanding hematoma.

86
00:05:53,637 --> 00:05:55,878
No pulse deficit.
They catch the guy yet?

87
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:59,174
- No. Dispatch doesn't know anything.
- He was mad at Mrs. Buckley.

88
00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:00,427
What's that?

89
00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:03,469
He was waving the gun at Mrs. Buckley,
yelling, then shot her.

90
00:06:03,643 --> 00:06:05,848
- Did we get a Mrs. Buckley?
- DOA.

91
00:06:06,436 --> 00:06:08,392
Gram of cefazolin,
follow with neuro exam.

92
00:06:08,562 --> 00:06:13,353
We've also got a GSW to the lateral
malleolus in Exam 2 still waiting.

93
00:06:13,523 --> 00:06:17,222
Portable x-ray and a Doppler scope. Make
sure the bullet didn't damage the bone.

94
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,192
Go ahead. I got this.

95
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,017
Let's get an AP lateral
to the left humerus.

96
00:06:22,194 --> 00:06:23,570
- Did you turn it in?
- What?

97
00:06:23,738 --> 00:06:26,572
Weaver said my application was
incomplete. Missing my peer reference.

98
00:06:26,739 --> 00:06:29,110
- Right, yeah. I'll do that today.
- It's due today.

99
00:06:29,282 --> 00:06:31,570
- Yeah. I'll do it.
- Okay, thanks.

100
00:06:31,742 --> 00:06:32,772
I need you here!

101
00:06:32,951 --> 00:06:35,239
Femoral artery's pumping blood.
I can't control it without my finger in it.

102
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,825
Get me surgeons. I got three unstable
patients and a fourth coming in.

103
00:06:38,996 --> 00:06:41,237
Anspaugh's gonna take this one.
I'll be back.

104
00:06:41,914 --> 00:06:43,373
- Dr. Weaver?
- Yeah.

105
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:46,908
Officer Napolitano. I need someone
to pull out a bullet for the crime lab.

106
00:06:47,084 --> 00:06:48,364
- Which patient?
- Calf wound.

107
00:06:48,543 --> 00:06:50,251
He's stable. We'll get to him soon.

108
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,292
- As long as we get evidence.
- Find the shooter.

109
00:06:52,462 --> 00:06:53,742
We'll get him.

110
00:06:53,922 --> 00:06:58,083
I was in the bathroom. I heard a loud
explosion. It scared me for a second.

111
00:06:58,257 --> 00:07:02,087
But then I remembered that they
were tearing down that building.

112
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:04,133
Then I heard all this screaming, and...

113
00:07:04,303 --> 00:07:08,250
BP, 132/78. Pulse, 96.
He was out front in the bushes.

114
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,754
Took us a while to find him.
We were inside.

115
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:13,800
- Kerry, what happened?
- Lunatic shot at a foster-care facility.

116
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,429
- Why?
- Who knows? Go. Curtain 3. Go!

117
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:17,763
You were right to stay.

118
00:07:17,935 --> 00:07:19,973
I should have gone to help,
done something.

119
00:07:20,144 --> 00:07:22,469
No. You did the right thing.
I'll be right back.

120
00:07:22,646 --> 00:07:25,266
Can I get a cigarette?
I need a cigarette.

121
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,597
Yeah. I'll see what I can do.

122
00:07:28,608 --> 00:07:32,271
Kerry, I've got a hypotensive social
worker. Probably just stress...

123
00:07:32,443 --> 00:07:34,316
- ... but you should check it out.
- Thanks.

124
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:36,063
Hello.

125
00:07:37,613 --> 00:07:40,363
- I read your letter.
- Good. I was wondering.

126
00:07:40,531 --> 00:07:42,986
Dr. Legaspi, Dr. Romano,
line three, for you.

127
00:07:43,158 --> 00:07:44,949
Tell him I'll call him back.

128
00:07:45,118 --> 00:07:46,527
She'll call you right back.

129
00:07:46,701 --> 00:07:51,491
Anyway, I appreciate the sentiment.

130
00:07:51,663 --> 00:07:52,742
"Sentiment"?

131
00:07:52,913 --> 00:07:56,779
He says for you to get on the line now.
He needs to talk to you about a transfer.

132
00:07:56,957 --> 00:08:00,407
She's busy. He should be too. We could
have as many as eight GSWs going.

133
00:08:00,584 --> 00:08:02,043
Nine. Carjack victim.

134
00:08:02,211 --> 00:08:04,960
We're swamped with this.
Tell them to divert to Mercy.

135
00:08:05,128 --> 00:08:06,919
Mercy said no ET As 9 to 10.

136
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:09,120
Why do they bother calling?

137
00:08:09,548 --> 00:08:11,835
Anyway, thank you...

138
00:08:12,007 --> 00:08:15,956
...but I don't think
that anything's changed.

139
00:08:17,636 --> 00:08:19,295
Right. Okay.

140
00:08:19,596 --> 00:08:23,757
- Okay. I should get back.
- Yeah.

141
00:08:25,724 --> 00:08:28,640
Chuny, grab Cleo. The kid
she's with isn't gonna make it.

142
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:29,923
Clear.

143
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,517
Asystole.

144
00:08:33,353 --> 00:08:36,686
- How long has she been down?
- At least an hour since the shooting.

145
00:08:36,855 --> 00:08:40,104
Dr. Finch, can you take
a carjack victim rolling up?

146
00:08:40,357 --> 00:08:42,763
Go ahead. This is a fatal wound.

147
00:08:43,318 --> 00:08:45,985
- What is it?
- GSW to the abdomen.

148
00:08:46,152 --> 00:08:49,317
Someone should have told me
that today was gun day.

149
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:54,105
Time of death, 9: 12.

150
00:09:03,788 --> 00:09:05,862
- This the carjacking?
- Yeah. Mr. Jeffries.

151
00:09:06,038 --> 00:09:08,363
GSW to the left lateral abdomen.

152
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,244
- You need to be careful.
- He has AIDS.

153
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:13,788
- How's his pressure?
-140/82.

154
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,449
- Okay, good. That's good.
- What do you got?

155
00:09:16,627 --> 00:09:19,793
Entrance wound below the costal margin
and the anterior axillary line.

156
00:09:19,963 --> 00:09:22,251
No exit. Mr. Jeffries is HIV-positive.

157
00:09:22,423 --> 00:09:25,506
I was getting out of the car.
He shot me anyway.

158
00:09:26,508 --> 00:09:28,133
- Frank, what's open?
- Nothing.

159
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,792
- I got a GSW.
- Don't make you special today.

160
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,673
- Mark called in. Trauma 1.
- That's fine. Let's go.

161
00:09:33,846 --> 00:09:35,802
Let's set him up.
Get him a portable chest.

162
00:09:35,972 --> 00:09:37,003
- Hey!
- Roger?

163
00:09:38,682 --> 00:09:40,092
- Stay away from my wife!
- What?

164
00:09:40,266 --> 00:09:42,970
You stay away from my wife!
She told me everything.

165
00:09:43,143 --> 00:09:44,969
You had your chance.
She's my wife now.

166
00:09:45,144 --> 00:09:47,515
- I don't know what you're-
- I'll take care of Carla.

167
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:50,011
- Frank, call Security!
- Get him out of here!

168
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,813
- Stay away!
- I haven't touched her!

169
00:09:51,982 --> 00:09:54,103
- I'll kick your ass!
- Knock it off. Come on.

170
00:09:56,317 --> 00:09:57,348
Nothing happened.

171
00:09:57,526 --> 00:10:00,146
Chuny, get a trauma panel.
Type and cross for four.

172
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,442
- He really nailed you.
- Mind your business!

173
00:10:02,613 --> 00:10:04,154
- Is this the carjacking?
- Yes.

174
00:10:04,321 --> 00:10:08,484
- Sir, I'm sorry about that.
- Sir? Sir, I'm Officer Napolitano.

175
00:10:08,658 --> 00:10:11,147
You told the officer
your assailant was Caucasian?

176
00:10:11,325 --> 00:10:13,816
- Yeah, that's right.
- Did he wear a yellow windbreaker?

177
00:10:13,994 --> 00:10:16,662
Yeah, you know.
How did you know that?

178
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:19,829
I think he might have shot some people
at a foster-care facility.

179
00:10:19,998 --> 00:10:21,788
- Same guy?
- And...

180
00:10:21,956 --> 00:10:23,581
...three.

181
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,829
- Can you remember your license plate?
- No.

182
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,492
- Pressure's down to 90.
- Two liters saline, wide open.

183
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:33,369
- But it's a black Acura Legend, correct?
- What's wrong?

184
00:10:33,547 --> 00:10:35,669
You'll have to do this later.
Check with DMV.

185
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,673
- Might be bleeding in your abdomen.
- How do you know for sure?

186
00:10:38,841 --> 00:10:41,841
- Let's get an ultrasound in here.
- It's a black Acura Legend?

187
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,338
What? Yeah.

188
00:10:43,511 --> 00:10:47,009
We have to put a tube in your chest
to help you breathe.

189
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:51,461
Prep the chest.

190
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,300
- You okay from here?
- Got it.

191
00:10:53,475 --> 00:10:56,095
- Lidocaine.
- Pulse ox, 98.

192
00:10:56,685 --> 00:10:58,973
- You almost missed your deadline.
- What?

193
00:11:01,021 --> 00:11:04,270
I was eating breakfast and saw
your med school reinstatement form...

194
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,897
...on your counter.

195
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:08,057
- What did you do?
- Ten blade.

196
00:11:08,233 --> 00:11:11,731
You were lucky. Lady in the registrar's
office has a daughter who is a nurse.

197
00:11:11,902 --> 00:11:12,980
The registrar's office?

198
00:11:13,152 --> 00:11:17,279
Told her you had a bunch of night shifts,
and she slipped it in with the others.

199
00:11:17,447 --> 00:11:18,822
-32 French.
- Wait.

200
00:11:18,989 --> 00:11:22,072
- You handed it in?
- Yeah. This morning.

201
00:11:22,241 --> 00:11:24,447
- Luka, why'd you do that?
- It was due Monday.

202
00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:27,190
- I didn't want to turn it in.
- I thought you forgot.

203
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,491
- No. I changed my mind.
- Why?

204
00:11:29,662 --> 00:11:31,737
Now they'll come after me
for summer tuition.

205
00:11:31,914 --> 00:11:34,036
- I can help you with the money.
- I don't want help.

206
00:11:34,207 --> 00:11:37,491
- I just wanted to let it go.
- Then why did you fill it out?

207
00:11:37,667 --> 00:11:40,038
I'll get you some Xeroform.

208
00:11:42,711 --> 00:11:46,292
Lesion by the shoulder. The bullet passed
mid-shaft. This is much more proximal.

209
00:11:46,463 --> 00:11:48,290
Look at the lateral.
It's in front of the bone.

210
00:11:48,465 --> 00:11:50,586
- Could be soft-tissue sarcoma.
- Get a biopsy.

211
00:11:50,757 --> 00:11:53,426
- Is your kid stable?
- Yeah. I just have to do an FNA.

212
00:11:53,592 --> 00:11:56,165
Clear the room. Next round coming in.
Two more gunshot wounds.

213
00:11:56,344 --> 00:11:58,466
- One chest, one neck.
- Two more? It's not even 10:00.

214
00:11:58,637 --> 00:12:00,047
- It's the same guy again.
- What?

215
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:03,423
CPD tracked a carjacked Acura
to a private residence.

216
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:05,222
Found a mother and son shot inside.

217
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,968
- Did they get the shooter?
- Not yet.

218
00:12:07,142 --> 00:12:09,217
- Do we have the ORs?
- Cleaning two now.

219
00:12:09,393 --> 00:12:11,219
- Peter still needs to go up.
- That leaves one.

220
00:12:11,394 --> 00:12:13,137
And Anspaugh
should be finishing soon.

221
00:12:13,312 --> 00:12:15,186
Psych nurses aren't trained
to handle ostomy care.

222
00:12:15,355 --> 00:12:17,145
If they need ostomy care,
he can check his own damn bag.

223
00:12:17,314 --> 00:12:19,057
We need you.
Two more GSWs rolling up.

224
00:12:19,232 --> 00:12:21,354
- In a minute.
- Abby, let's go outside.

225
00:12:21,525 --> 00:12:23,434
And when I call you,
you get on the phone!

226
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,360
She was helping
with the mass casualty.

227
00:12:26,528 --> 00:12:29,730
I needed to clear Recovery for the barrage
of gunshot wounds you keep accepting!

228
00:12:29,905 --> 00:12:33,107
I'm not taking responsibility for post-op
complications in the psych ward!

229
00:12:33,282 --> 00:12:36,732
Well, then we'll have to find somebody
who's interested in responsibility.

230
00:12:36,909 --> 00:12:39,862
- What is that supposed to mean?
- DeRaad can finish your shift.

231
00:12:40,036 --> 00:12:42,242
- What?
- Nice knowing you.

232
00:12:43,871 --> 00:12:45,864
GSW through the right lateral neck.
Airway's clear.

233
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,746
- What's his pressure?
-110/70.

234
00:12:47,915 --> 00:12:49,540
- Hi. What's your name?
- Ted.

235
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,910
- Ted, can you swallow for me?
- Where's my mom?

236
00:12:53,085 --> 00:12:54,911
- Is all this his?
- Dr. Greene?

237
00:12:55,086 --> 00:12:58,418
No. His mom was wrapped around him.
The bullet went through her into his neck.

238
00:12:58,588 --> 00:12:59,751
- Mommy!
- Dr. Greene.

239
00:12:59,922 --> 00:13:02,757
Get Dr. Weaver to scope him.
He may need an esophagram.

240
00:13:02,924 --> 00:13:05,674
We're gonna take you inside.
Okay, Ted?

241
00:13:05,842 --> 00:13:09,209
I think this is the lady that brought in
your abused kid last week.

242
00:13:09,385 --> 00:13:12,469
Simple gunshot wound to the back.
BP, 128/74.

243
00:13:12,637 --> 00:13:15,590
- Mrs. Shayatovich.
- Where's Ted? Where's Ted?

244
00:13:15,764 --> 00:13:17,887
He's gonna be okay.
There's another doctor looking at him.

245
00:13:18,058 --> 00:13:21,923
Please, help him. He was bleeding.
His neck was bleeding.

246
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:24,094
Who shot you, Mrs. Shayatovich?

247
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,973
Derek. I told the policeman
it was Derek Fossen.

248
00:13:27,146 --> 00:13:28,889
Your neighbor.

249
00:13:29,064 --> 00:13:31,186
He was looking for Ben.
I told him I didn't know where he was.

250
00:13:31,357 --> 00:13:35,305
He said if I was gonna take his boy away
he was gonna take mine from me.

251
00:13:35,484 --> 00:13:38,152
Please, please help him.
He was bleeding.

252
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:41,769
We're gonna take care of him.
Let's get a HemoCue and a pulse ox.

253
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,439
Roll her, roll her, roll her!

254
00:13:45,823 --> 00:13:47,815
Oh, God! That looks like
about two liters.

255
00:13:47,992 --> 00:13:50,445
May be an aorta-esophageal fistula.

256
00:13:50,618 --> 00:13:52,277
- She's out.
- Okay, bag her.

257
00:13:52,452 --> 00:13:53,732
I'll intubate her inside.

258
00:13:53,911 --> 00:13:57,659
Get a thoracotomy tray
and all the O-negative we got.

259
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:02,578
Fossen. Derek Fossen. F-O-S-S-E-N.

260
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,204
Looks like it was contained until it
blew through the esophagus.

261
00:14:05,376 --> 00:14:07,332
- Do you have an address?
- He lives next door to her.

262
00:14:07,502 --> 00:14:10,455
- Can't get a pressure.
- Squeeze in two units of O-neg.

263
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:11,660
I'm in.

264
00:14:12,505 --> 00:14:15,707
We put his son into protective custody.
His name is Ben.

265
00:14:15,882 --> 00:14:17,838
He should be somewhere
in the foster-care system.

266
00:14:18,009 --> 00:14:20,249
- Lost the pulse.
- All right. Rib spreader.

267
00:14:20,468 --> 00:14:22,756
Find the son.
That's who he's looking for.

268
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:24,967
Abby, get the infuser.

269
00:14:25,513 --> 00:14:27,255
Pressure's up to 120 after two liters.

270
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,173
- Do you need this?
- No.

271
00:14:29,348 --> 00:14:31,256
Liver and spleen are intact.

272
00:14:31,432 --> 00:14:32,926
So maybe I'm not bleeding.

273
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,017
No. You've got a slow leak
from a small vessel.

274
00:14:36,186 --> 00:14:38,426
- You're gonna need surgery.
- I don't want surgery.

275
00:14:38,604 --> 00:14:42,386
Look, we'll make a midline incision, find
the bleeding artery and then tie it off.

276
00:14:42,564 --> 00:14:44,437
Doc, I'm already dying.

277
00:14:44,607 --> 00:14:48,105
Your infection might slow your recovery
but it's routine surgery.

278
00:14:48,275 --> 00:14:49,770
People live with HIV.

279
00:14:49,944 --> 00:14:53,311
I know that. I've been fighting
this disease since 1986.

280
00:14:53,487 --> 00:14:57,435
I responded to the AZT, and the
protease inhibitors were a miracle.

281
00:14:58,156 --> 00:15:00,777
They gave me an extra five years.

282
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:04,531
But my T cells have been
dropping since July.

283
00:15:04,702 --> 00:15:08,116
My viral load's gone through the roof,
even with all these antivirals.

284
00:15:08,954 --> 00:15:12,404
Mr. Jeffries, I need your consent.

285
00:15:12,915 --> 00:15:14,622
No.

286
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:17,281
I had pneumocystis three months ago.

287
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:22,166
- If we don't operate, you'll die.
- I am already dead, doc.

288
00:15:22,337 --> 00:15:26,547
This may just allow me to skip
a very painful end.

289
00:15:29,925 --> 00:15:31,916
- Another Satinsky.
- Unit eight is up.

290
00:15:32,092 --> 00:15:36,467
- Heart's not filling. Clamp the aorta.
- Greene, the injury is high and posterior.

291
00:15:36,637 --> 00:15:38,712
- Just trying to bring you more light.
- That'll help.

292
00:15:38,888 --> 00:15:41,295
- Can't you get your finger in the hole?
- If I could see it.

293
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:42,635
More light.

294
00:15:42,807 --> 00:15:44,846
- Just call for FFP and platelets.
- Forget it, forget it.

295
00:15:45,017 --> 00:15:47,423
- I can't close this defect.
- Another amp of epi.

296
00:15:47,602 --> 00:15:50,886
She'll go out of thoracic aorta
and exsanguinate in seconds.

297
00:15:51,062 --> 00:15:53,813
- Let's try bypass.
- It's too late for that. Call it.

298
00:15:55,648 --> 00:15:57,889
Time of death, 11:40.

299
00:15:58,774 --> 00:16:01,525
0 for 2 and it's not even lunch.

300
00:16:07,655 --> 00:16:10,939
We pull the sample out with a needle.
And then we look under a microscope.

301
00:16:11,115 --> 00:16:14,981
- You think it's cancer?
- It could be scar tissue. Or a cyst.

302
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:17,399
Cancer's only one possibility.

303
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:19,284
My mom died of cancer.

304
00:16:19,453 --> 00:16:23,235
- How old was she?
-35. I'm 12.

305
00:16:24,455 --> 00:16:27,490
Let's see the biopsy first. That way
we can talk about what we know...

306
00:16:27,665 --> 00:16:29,741
...as opposed to what we don't know.

307
00:16:29,917 --> 00:16:31,826
Do you have anybody
that you'd like me to call?

308
00:16:32,002 --> 00:16:34,669
- I'm in foster care.
- Yeah, I know. Foster parents?

309
00:16:34,837 --> 00:16:37,670
- No. I'm between homes.
- Right.

310
00:16:41,298 --> 00:16:43,125
- She make it?
- No.

311
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,920
- This guy's on a rampage.
- They didn't catch him yet?

312
00:16:46,093 --> 00:16:48,714
I don't know.
They're gonna go to his house.

313
00:16:49,345 --> 00:16:51,336
So much violence, huh?

314
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,469
- Were you gonna tell me?
- Tell you what?

315
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,966
- I heard a rumor.
- Oh, yeah? A good one?

316
00:17:00,143 --> 00:17:02,182
Dr. Rosen called.

317
00:17:03,061 --> 00:17:06,263
You know, from the emergency
department at Northwestern.

318
00:17:06,438 --> 00:17:09,770
- You took the message?
- He wanted to set up an appointment.

319
00:17:11,107 --> 00:17:13,313
- Just looking at options.
- Are you leaving?

320
00:17:14,192 --> 00:17:15,984
I still have to make up
three months of my residency.

321
00:17:16,152 --> 00:17:18,606
- Well, after that?
- I don't know.

322
00:17:19,654 --> 00:17:21,941
I'm not even being considered
for Chief Resident.

323
00:17:22,113 --> 00:17:25,315
I have to write this damn
peer review for Chen.

324
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:29,024
They're not even talking me
about an Attending position.

325
00:17:29,201 --> 00:17:31,691
Have you talked to Weaver
about an Attending position?

326
00:17:31,869 --> 00:17:33,529
- No.
- Why not?

327
00:17:33,912 --> 00:17:36,283
Because if she wanted me,
she would have asked me about it.

328
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:38,032
Maybe she doesn't
think you're interested.

329
00:17:38,415 --> 00:17:40,490
Maybe I'm not.

330
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,911
Carter, is your cirrhosis patient
ready to go to the floor?

331
00:17:44,085 --> 00:17:45,875
No. I have to do a paracentesis first.

332
00:17:46,044 --> 00:17:47,787
- We need the bed.
- Got it.

333
00:17:47,962 --> 00:17:50,499
What's the chest tube output
on the gardener?

334
00:17:50,672 --> 00:17:54,004
300 cc's. He's third in line for a tele.

335
00:17:56,591 --> 00:17:59,377
- You still angry at me?
- I wasn't angry.

336
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:02,386
- You seemed angry.
- It's my fault. I should have ripped it up.

337
00:18:02,553 --> 00:18:04,095
I thought you wanted
to go back to school.

338
00:18:04,263 --> 00:18:05,922
Maybe I do. Just not now.

339
00:18:06,097 --> 00:18:07,805
- What happened?
- Nothing.

340
00:18:07,973 --> 00:18:10,546
You don't want to be
a doctor anymore?

341
00:18:10,725 --> 00:18:11,756
I don't know.

342
00:18:11,934 --> 00:18:13,759
- You don't know?
- I don't know.

343
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:16,965
It's $40,000 in tuition.
It's lost wages.

344
00:18:17,145 --> 00:18:19,516
It's another six years
of me killing myself.

345
00:18:19,688 --> 00:18:21,680
Then it's over and you'll be
doing what you want.

346
00:18:21,856 --> 00:18:23,349
Maybe I'm doing what I want.

347
00:18:23,523 --> 00:18:25,930
If that were true,
you would have never started.

348
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:29,891
Maybe I realized being a nurse is good
enough. Is it not good enough for you?

349
00:18:30,069 --> 00:18:32,310
No, no. It's fine.

350
00:18:36,364 --> 00:18:39,068
Okay. You did great, Ted.

351
00:18:39,241 --> 00:18:42,324
The bullet went through a muscle
in your neck. But you're gonna be okay.

352
00:18:42,493 --> 00:18:46,406
- Can I see my mom now?
- Let me find out.

353
00:18:46,579 --> 00:18:48,903
- Do you know your dad's work number?
- No.

354
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,404
- Okay. Do you know where he works?
- Abysco.

355
00:18:51,582 --> 00:18:54,497
- Abysco? Is that a company?
- He makes binders.

356
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,500
He makes binders. All right.
You want to draw some more?

357
00:18:57,668 --> 00:18:59,744
- Yeah.
- I'll be right back.

358
00:19:07,632 --> 00:19:11,794
- The mom didn't make it?
- The proximal aorta was shredded.

359
00:19:11,968 --> 00:19:15,003
I have to track down his father.
What do you want to tell the boy?

360
00:19:15,178 --> 00:19:17,964
- I'll stall.
- Dr. Greene?

361
00:19:21,598 --> 00:19:22,843
This him?

362
00:19:24,433 --> 00:19:26,225
Yeah. He has a record?

363
00:19:26,393 --> 00:19:29,013
One arrest. Domestic dispute.
He hit his girlfriend.

364
00:19:29,186 --> 00:19:30,977
He wasn't at his house?

365
00:19:31,146 --> 00:19:34,099
- I'll let you know when we have him.
- What about his son?

366
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:37,687
We tracked down the foster parents.
A patrol car's picking him up now.

367
00:19:37,858 --> 00:19:39,731
- I think he's coming here.
- What?

368
00:19:39,901 --> 00:19:43,434
Well, he was pissed at the neighbor
for bringing him to the ER.

369
00:19:43,611 --> 00:19:46,611
- You took his kid away from him, right?
- Right.

370
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,695
- Thanks, Frank.
- I'll send in some extra units.

371
00:19:51,741 --> 00:19:55,488
Mark, he couldn't come here. He
knows there's too many cops around.

372
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,901
He hasn't displayed a lot
of sound judgment so far.

373
00:19:58,078 --> 00:20:01,576
- What is he shooting with?
- Semiautomatic pistol, 13-round clip.

374
00:20:01,747 --> 00:20:04,948
- He's been reloading.
- Maybe picked it up at Kmart on the way.

375
00:20:05,123 --> 00:20:07,614
- It's not the guns. People kill people.
- Yeah, right.

376
00:20:07,792 --> 00:20:10,364
- But not as fast.
- He would have found another weapon.

377
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:13,459
Fourteen shots so far, Frank.
Six deaths.

378
00:20:13,628 --> 00:20:16,960
You can't affect mass murder
with a Chinese throwing star.

379
00:20:17,131 --> 00:20:21,257
Rescue 78 coming in with an injured cop.
Motorist dragged him for half a block.

380
00:20:21,425 --> 00:20:23,297
There you go. He hit him with a car.

381
00:20:23,467 --> 00:20:26,669
- That's assault with a deadly weapon.
- Shut up!

382
00:20:26,844 --> 00:20:31,006
Free air under the diaphragm.
Must have nicked the bowel too.

383
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,930
His crit's down to 23.
I can't dilute him much further.

384
00:20:34,098 --> 00:20:36,932
I checked his viral load.
It's over 50,000.

385
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,804
He'll die of an opportunistic
infection within a year.

386
00:20:39,977 --> 00:20:43,142
Well, that doesn't mean we should
help him commit suicide.

387
00:20:43,645 --> 00:20:44,760
He didn't shoot himself.

388
00:20:44,938 --> 00:20:46,894
If we let him refuse surgery,
it's the same thing.

389
00:20:47,064 --> 00:20:50,396
- Get a court order then.
- He'll be dead by the time it's approved.

390
00:20:50,566 --> 00:20:52,605
Then it's his choice.

391
00:20:54,401 --> 00:20:55,895
All right.

392
00:20:56,069 --> 00:20:57,610
I went over there.

393
00:20:57,778 --> 00:21:00,529
She was upset. She was crying.

394
00:21:00,697 --> 00:21:04,906
She came on to me. I didn't do anything.
I didn't want to do anything.

395
00:21:05,075 --> 00:21:08,157
Maybe she felt guilty and she
told Roger and she put a spin on it.

396
00:21:08,326 --> 00:21:10,117
- And you wouldn't put a spin on it.
- No.

397
00:21:10,286 --> 00:21:11,316
Then why didn't you tell me?

398
00:21:11,494 --> 00:21:12,739
- To avoid this.
- What?

399
00:21:12,912 --> 00:21:14,074
You looking at me
like I did something wrong.

400
00:21:14,246 --> 00:21:17,744
I see. You didn't trust me
and I'm supposed to trust you.

401
00:21:17,915 --> 00:21:20,998
- I didn't think it was worth getting into.
- At least I know where I stand.

402
00:21:21,167 --> 00:21:24,036
Cleo, that's not what I meant
and you know it.

403
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:26,617
- Peter, his pressure's dropping.
- Go.

404
00:21:27,671 --> 00:21:29,295
Run in another liter of saline.

405
00:21:29,464 --> 00:21:31,668
- Any chest pain or dizziness?
- No.

406
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:34,958
Let's get two units from the blood bank
and transfuse each over an hour.

407
00:21:35,133 --> 00:21:38,086
No, no, no. I don't want
a blood transfusion.

408
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,715
Your hematocrit is drifting
to a dangerously low level.

409
00:21:40,887 --> 00:21:42,463
I understand.

410
00:21:42,638 --> 00:21:44,843
No. Thank you.

411
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:48,014
What about your family?

412
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:51,680
I mean, if you don't care about yourself,
what about them?

413
00:21:51,851 --> 00:21:55,514
I haven't spoken to my mother
in over 30 years.

414
00:21:55,686 --> 00:21:58,437
I outlived the two people
that I loved in the world.

415
00:21:58,605 --> 00:22:01,723
I've lived longer than I expected.

416
00:22:02,774 --> 00:22:04,682
Just let me go.

417
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:06,352
I'm ready.

418
00:22:20,743 --> 00:22:22,023
- Hi.
- Hi.

419
00:22:27,372 --> 00:22:30,075
- How are you feeling?
- My neck hurts.

420
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:32,998
I'll ask one of the nurses to come
give you some medicine.

421
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:35,205
Can I see my mom?

422
00:22:35,376 --> 00:22:37,913
Not yet. I'm trying to reach your dad.

423
00:22:38,086 --> 00:22:40,790
Can I stay with her until you do?

424
00:22:40,963 --> 00:22:43,997
I don't think so.
She's having an operation right now.

425
00:22:44,173 --> 00:22:45,915
Is she okay?

426
00:22:46,716 --> 00:22:51,709
We're having a little trouble trying to get
the bleeding stopped around her heart.

427
00:22:51,969 --> 00:22:55,550
- She was hurt bad.
- I know.

428
00:22:57,096 --> 00:22:59,883
- You hungry?
- No.

429
00:23:00,057 --> 00:23:01,515
- Where's all this blood from?
- Tore off part of his ear.

430
00:23:01,683 --> 00:23:02,880
Give him more pain medicine.

431
00:23:03,058 --> 00:23:05,727
Titrate 10 of morphine.
Did you lose consciousness?

432
00:23:05,894 --> 00:23:07,517
- I don't think so.
- Got him, Luka?

433
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:08,966
Yeah. Trauma panel...

434
00:23:09,146 --> 00:23:10,343
- Did you get a good look at him?
- Not really.

435
00:23:10,521 --> 00:23:13,093
- Yellow windbreaker?
- Yeah. He saw blood on the collar.

436
00:23:13,273 --> 00:23:14,552
Fossen did this?

437
00:23:14,731 --> 00:23:17,435
- Just a minute.
- Colby asked him to step out.

438
00:23:17,608 --> 00:23:20,892
When he opened the door, the guy
smashed our unit and took off.

439
00:23:21,069 --> 00:23:25,064
Colby's jacket must've got snagged. He
was screaming. He got dragged forever.

440
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:27,064
- He didn't stop.
- Where did he get the car?

441
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,269
Probably boosted it.

442
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:30,570
Jeep Grand Cherokee,
first three license numbers G74?

443
00:23:30,741 --> 00:23:32,200
- That's all I got down.
- Could it be G79?

444
00:23:32,367 --> 00:23:34,109
- You got him?
- Shots fired at 823 Piedmont.

445
00:23:34,285 --> 00:23:37,533
Jeep Grand Cherokee parked
at the corner. License number G79-6L5.

446
00:23:37,703 --> 00:23:40,276
- Woman found down inside.
- Oh, God. Here we go.

447
00:23:40,455 --> 00:23:43,371
- Easy. Is she dead?
- Called in the paramedics.

448
00:23:43,749 --> 00:23:45,242
We're all overworked, Robert.

449
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:48,700
You can't insinuate you'll fire someone
every time you're frustrated.

450
00:23:48,876 --> 00:23:50,251
- I'm not. She's fired.
- Robert.

451
00:23:50,419 --> 00:23:53,668
- Cleaning out her locker right now.
- You can't do that.

452
00:23:53,838 --> 00:23:57,537
This is a county facility.
Employees cannot be summarily fired.

453
00:23:57,715 --> 00:24:00,039
She was already on probation
for that other matter.

454
00:24:00,216 --> 00:24:01,247
She was exonerated.

455
00:24:01,425 --> 00:24:04,211
And she's had a history of violation
of institutional policy.

456
00:24:04,385 --> 00:24:06,543
- Like what?
- What do you care?

457
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,344
She's a good doctor.

458
00:24:08,512 --> 00:24:12,129
A good doctor who has had 30 delinquent
charts awaiting discharge summaries.

459
00:24:12,306 --> 00:24:15,140
- So does half the staff.
- She used the telephone watch line...

460
00:24:15,308 --> 00:24:17,051
- ... for personal calls.
- You're kidding!

461
00:24:17,226 --> 00:24:21,008
- She yelled at a patient in public.
- You're trying to find a way to fire her.

462
00:24:21,187 --> 00:24:24,305
There's plenty of documentation that
the disciplinary committee has reviewed.

463
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,594
- Dr. Weaver.
- Give me a minute.

464
00:24:25,772 --> 00:24:27,017
- It's Adele. She's been shot.
- What?

465
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:30,106
- That maniac shot her at her house.
- The social worker?

466
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:32,930
Chest x-ray, T and L spine.

467
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:36,193
- Get an ultrasound. Feel this?
- Yeah.

468
00:24:36,362 --> 00:24:39,112
Did you get a look at the man
who shot you?

469
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,031
He looked familiar.
He said something about his son.

470
00:24:42,198 --> 00:24:45,115
We put his son Ben
into protective custody last week.

471
00:24:45,284 --> 00:24:47,856
- Oh, my God.
- Okay. Adele, can you feel this?

472
00:24:48,035 --> 00:24:49,114
No.

473
00:24:49,286 --> 00:24:53,234
Cord injury, 1.8 grams Solu-Medrol
over 15 minutes.

474
00:24:53,413 --> 00:24:54,492
- Hi, Adele.
- Hi.

475
00:24:54,664 --> 00:24:56,869
She was shot mid-back.
She can't move her legs.

476
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,032
White male, late 30s,
yellow windbreaker?

477
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,538
Yeah. I think so.

478
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:04,626
- Any pain in the belly?
- BP, 92/65. Pulse, 110.

479
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:06,537
- Any pain in your belly?
- Not really.

480
00:25:06,712 --> 00:25:10,246
- Could be a pneumothorax.
- Lungs sound good. Pulse ox is 99.

481
00:25:10,423 --> 00:25:12,960
- For an intra-abdominal bleed?
- There's spinal shock.

482
00:25:13,133 --> 00:25:15,837
- How did he know where I lived?
- What?

483
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:18,630
I only saw him at the hospital.

484
00:25:18,803 --> 00:25:21,719
- They can find anything on the Internet.
- What?

485
00:25:21,888 --> 00:25:24,294
- Get someone over to my house.
- What?

486
00:25:24,472 --> 00:25:28,848
Send someone over to my house now.
1211 Dupont Drive.

487
00:25:33,311 --> 00:25:36,062
[***]

488
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,977
She's still hypotensive.
Want dopamine?

489
00:25:45,151 --> 00:25:46,693
Start her on five mics.

490
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:49,444
Come on, Elizabeth. Pick up.

491
00:25:50,529 --> 00:25:51,853
Pick up.

492
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:56,328
- Does this feel sharp?
- Yes.

493
00:25:56,506 --> 00:25:58,083
- What's her crit?
- Working on it.

494
00:25:58,257 --> 00:26:00,166
- How about here?
- Yes.

495
00:26:00,343 --> 00:26:02,584
- Do you have voice mail or machine?
- Machine.

496
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:04,885
- Would she hear you leaving a message?
- I don't know.

497
00:26:05,056 --> 00:26:07,428
- How about here?
- No.

498
00:26:07,642 --> 00:26:10,393
Were you already home
or was he waiting for you?

499
00:26:10,561 --> 00:26:14,144
He came in. I was sitting
at my desk doing my bills.

500
00:26:14,315 --> 00:26:16,308
Patellar reflexes are absent.

501
00:26:16,484 --> 00:26:18,940
Dr. Greene, no one's answering the door.
Do you want them to search the house?

502
00:26:19,196 --> 00:26:20,690
- Yeah.
- They'd have to force entry.

503
00:26:20,864 --> 00:26:23,864
- Search the house!
-942, go ahead.

504
00:26:24,033 --> 00:26:25,825
- Still hypotensive.
- Up her to 10 mics.

505
00:26:25,994 --> 00:26:27,702
- She needs volume.
- I'm not in yet.

506
00:26:34,419 --> 00:26:37,124
Adele, can you bend your knee?

507
00:26:37,297 --> 00:26:39,124
- I can't move it.
- Look, I don't care.

508
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:42,253
We may have an emergency
laminectomy. Fine. Check. Go.

509
00:26:42,427 --> 00:26:45,049
Doc, they'll call it in
when they have it secured.

510
00:26:46,015 --> 00:26:49,764
- Am I paralyzed?
- Hopefully, it's only temporary.

511
00:26:50,436 --> 00:26:53,105
- That's it. Give me a new kit.
- Check for sacral sparing.

512
00:26:53,272 --> 00:26:54,647
Come on, now. Now.

513
00:26:54,815 --> 00:26:57,057
Set up the microscope.
We're coming up.

514
00:26:57,234 --> 00:26:58,645
Maybe she went out,
went to the store.

515
00:26:58,819 --> 00:26:59,982
- Did you page her?
- What?

516
00:27:00,154 --> 00:27:01,482
- Did you page her?
- No.

517
00:27:01,655 --> 00:27:03,981
I need you to page Dr. Corday.

518
00:27:04,158 --> 00:27:05,985
I don't-
I know that! Page her!

519
00:27:22,802 --> 00:27:25,375
Mr. Jeffries. Mr. Jeffries.

520
00:27:25,555 --> 00:27:27,347
- What's his HemoCue?
- Down to five.

521
00:27:27,516 --> 00:27:30,516
- Barely responds to painful stimuli.
- Hang two units of blood.

522
00:27:30,685 --> 00:27:33,390
- He doesn't want that.
- Where's the consent form?

523
00:27:33,563 --> 00:27:35,686
- On the cart.
- You can't take him without consent.

524
00:27:35,857 --> 00:27:37,600
He's unable to give consent now.

525
00:27:37,775 --> 00:27:40,349
I need two physicians' signatures
for emergency surgery.

526
00:27:40,528 --> 00:27:41,608
No.

527
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,654
- You'd have him die?
- I'll respect his wishes.

528
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:04,385
Good, Adele. The spinal injury
is incomplete. We can operate.

529
00:28:04,553 --> 00:28:06,676
- I need an emergency signature.
- Not now.

530
00:28:06,847 --> 00:28:09,552
IJ's in. Let's get another chest.

531
00:28:09,725 --> 00:28:12,347
- He's bleeding out.
- Run the Solu-Medrol. 325 an hour.

532
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:16,469
- Gunshot wound to the belly-
- Yeah, yeah. Whatever. Whatever. Go.

533
00:28:16,649 --> 00:28:18,441
Systolic's up to 100.

534
00:28:19,569 --> 00:28:23,352
All right. Let's get him up.
Can you get a repeat CBC?

535
00:28:23,532 --> 00:28:26,153
- Whatever you want, Peter.
- I've got my two signatures.

536
00:28:26,326 --> 00:28:27,701
He made himself clear.

537
00:28:27,869 --> 00:28:31,202
Look, he has advanced AIDS.
He probably has an HIV encephalopathy.

538
00:28:31,372 --> 00:28:34,327
No. He was alert and oriented.

539
00:28:34,501 --> 00:28:37,336
- You should have called Psych.
- I did. They never showed up.

540
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:39,912
- Laura called. They're still-
- Damn it!

541
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:42,877
- Oh, God! I'm sorry.
- Hold on. Did you cut yourself?

542
00:28:43,051 --> 00:28:45,803
I don't think so.
The glove just tore there.

543
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,299
- Peter.
- Hold on. Hold on.

544
00:28:47,472 --> 00:28:49,264
Let me get some gauze pads.
Come on.

545
00:29:01,654 --> 00:29:03,112
Let me see it, all right?

546
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,031
- Oh, God.
- Keep irrigating it.

547
00:29:11,205 --> 00:29:13,245
- Where are the Zerowets?
- Bottom left drawer.

548
00:29:13,416 --> 00:29:17,200
Pharmacy? This is Dr. Benton.
I need you to pull a PEP kit for me.

549
00:29:17,378 --> 00:29:19,287
All right. Use two liters.

550
00:29:19,463 --> 00:29:22,001
What? No. Look, I'm on my way
up there right now.

551
00:29:22,174 --> 00:29:25,259
- What about the patient?
- Keep transfusing him.

552
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,716
- Talk to Neuro?
- They're doing a craniotomy.

553
00:29:32,894 --> 00:29:33,973
Watch it, Peter.

554
00:29:34,145 --> 00:29:35,889
I need help with
a thoracic decompression.

555
00:29:36,064 --> 00:29:40,642
There's a piece of bone in your
mid-back, pressing on your spinal cord.

556
00:29:40,818 --> 00:29:42,396
That's why I can't move my legs?

557
00:29:42,571 --> 00:29:45,144
Yes. But if they remove the fragment,
you may recover.

558
00:29:45,324 --> 00:29:47,316
No one's at your house.
We did a sweep.

559
00:29:47,492 --> 00:29:49,034
- Check my garage?
- Yeah. Nothing.

560
00:29:49,203 --> 00:29:51,325
- Call me if you find her.
- Will I be paralyzed?

561
00:29:51,496 --> 00:29:53,785
- Not if I can help it.
- I still need to talk to you.

562
00:29:53,957 --> 00:29:55,072
Drop it. It's over.

563
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:56,744
- Is my van still there?
- What?

564
00:29:56,918 --> 00:29:59,160
- The garage. Was my van there?
- Yeah. Yeah.

565
00:29:59,338 --> 00:30:01,461
- But you have two cars.
- Hers is in the shop.

566
00:30:01,632 --> 00:30:05,582
- Does she take the baby out?
- She's been going for walks around 3.

567
00:30:05,844 --> 00:30:08,134
- It's 1:05.
- It depends on the baby's schedule.

568
00:30:08,305 --> 00:30:10,548
Can you keep a unit there
until she gets home?

569
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:11,923
- Nick.
- Yeah.

570
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:14,508
- Nick, listen.
- Shot in the head from the back.

571
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:17,688
- The guy was riding in the back seat.
- Cab driver on Roosevelt.

572
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:19,683
Roger that, 27. Rescue's en route.

573
00:30:19,858 --> 00:30:22,860
Okay, that'll be us. Can you
give it to Luka? I have to go upstairs.

574
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:25,236
- Think it's him?
- Yeah, that's him.

575
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,525
I can't reach this boy's father.

576
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,159
- And he's figuring it out.
- Who?

577
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,782
The neck wound. His mother died.
You need to talk to him.

578
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,579
I'll be right there.

579
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:38,368
Carter, we got a GSW to the head
coming in. I want you to prep Trauma 1.

580
00:30:38,544 --> 00:30:42,079
- Get Dilantin, mannitol and Decadron.
- ETA?

581
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,878
- Check with dispatch.
- Ewing seems pretty aggressive.

582
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:48,006
We'll need a chest and abdominal CT
to rule out metastatic disease.

583
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,548
- You sure? It's a soft-tissue mass.
- Extra-osseous. It's rare.

584
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:53,931
You might want to write it up.

585
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,810
- Thank you.
- Want me to talk to the parents?

586
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:58,221
He doesn't have any parents.

587
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:04,028
Where is she? Where is my mom?
Where is this operation?

588
00:31:07,158 --> 00:31:09,827
The bullet...

589
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:13,909
She was shot in the back.

590
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:16,454
The bullet passed through her heart.

591
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:21,539
She lost so much blood
that her heart stopped beating.

592
00:31:23,007 --> 00:31:26,791
We opened up her chest
for an emergency surgery.

593
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:30,421
We gave her blood transfusions.

594
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:36,429
The best surgeon in the hospital did it.

595
00:31:42,068 --> 00:31:45,235
She wasn't in any pain.
She didn't suffer.

596
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:49,941
We worked on her for a long time.

597
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:56,533
We couldn't stop the bleeding.

598
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:59,460
And we couldn't get her heart
to beat again.

599
00:32:02,506 --> 00:32:05,710
Ted, your mother died.

600
00:32:07,761 --> 00:32:09,838
I'm sorry.

601
00:32:17,604 --> 00:32:19,893
Here. You need to take these now.

602
00:32:20,065 --> 00:32:23,600
- Shouldn't we draw baseline labs first?
- No. Now. The sooner the better.

603
00:32:23,778 --> 00:32:26,269
Peter, two units are in.
I can't get his pressure above 80.

604
00:32:26,447 --> 00:32:28,773
- All right. Hold on.
- He's already drug-resistant.

605
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,741
- You don't have a large viral load.
- He does.

606
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:35,288
Cleo, listen to me. The conversion rate
with meds is less than 3 in 1000.

607
00:32:35,457 --> 00:32:38,327
Peter. Crit is 14.
If he's going, he has to go now.

608
00:32:39,336 --> 00:32:41,043
Okay?

609
00:32:41,212 --> 00:32:44,248
All right. Get another two units.
I'll meet you at the elevator.

610
00:32:44,423 --> 00:32:48,505
Call Infectious Disease. See if they need
to modify the post-exposure regimen.

611
00:33:13,203 --> 00:33:14,697
I'm surprised my code still works.

612
00:33:14,871 --> 00:33:17,825
- It's not gonna happen, Kim.
- What isn't?

613
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,994
- They can't let you go, not legally.
- No. They always intended to fire me.

614
00:33:23,171 --> 00:33:27,004
They would have done it sooner, but they
needed a thick Human Resource file first.

615
00:33:27,176 --> 00:33:29,501
Which is bogus.
They'll never get away with it.

616
00:33:29,678 --> 00:33:32,170
- They already have.
- Only if you let them.

617
00:33:32,348 --> 00:33:33,546
It's not worth the effort.

618
00:33:33,724 --> 00:33:36,429
I'm not interested in working
for a place that doesn't want me.

619
00:33:36,602 --> 00:33:40,267
You have the right to due process.
We can find a civil-rights attorney.

620
00:33:40,439 --> 00:33:41,554
We?

621
00:33:46,738 --> 00:33:48,018
It's not right, Kim.

622
00:33:48,197 --> 00:33:50,819
You know why they're firing you.

623
00:33:50,992 --> 00:33:54,361
You have to fight it.
You have to fight this.

624
00:33:54,954 --> 00:33:56,697
I'm supposed to fight?

625
00:33:56,874 --> 00:33:59,543
You're hiding
but I'm supposed to fight.

626
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:02,545
Well, I'm sorry.
But I don't want to fight.

627
00:34:02,713 --> 00:34:05,998
I just want to move on.
So should you.

628
00:34:10,512 --> 00:34:13,881
Chris and Hillary. It's Mark Greene.
I'm looking for Elizabeth.

629
00:34:14,057 --> 00:34:16,216
If you see her, could you ask her
to give me a call?

630
00:34:16,393 --> 00:34:18,017
- Thanks.
- Dr. Greene, we got him.

631
00:34:18,187 --> 00:34:19,598
He opened fire in Lincoln Park.

632
00:34:19,772 --> 00:34:22,689
Shot three people before being
taken down by a civilian packing a 9mm.

633
00:34:22,858 --> 00:34:25,480
- Is he still alive?
- So far.

634
00:34:25,778 --> 00:34:27,854
- What's he had?
- Two amps of epi and atropine.

635
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:30,237
Is this the cabby?

636
00:34:30,408 --> 00:34:31,606
Shot at the base of his skull.

637
00:34:31,784 --> 00:34:35,153
- Cleo, jump in on this?
- High cervical injury. Blew out his brains.

638
00:34:35,329 --> 00:34:38,081
- Cleo!
- Any vitals in the field?

639
00:34:38,249 --> 00:34:40,372
- No. Just lots of brain matter.
- Any witnesses?

640
00:34:40,543 --> 00:34:42,536
- No. But we think it was Fossen.
- Well, why?

641
00:34:42,712 --> 00:34:45,832
1211 Dupont was the last entry
on the driver's log at 1: 14 p. m.

642
00:34:46,007 --> 00:34:47,799
- What?
- The house you had searched.

643
00:34:47,967 --> 00:34:49,592
Fossen must have been
on his way over there.

644
00:34:49,761 --> 00:34:51,919
Cabby probably heard
his description on the radio.

645
00:34:52,097 --> 00:34:54,848
- Dr. Greene?
- Bang. Fossen blew his brains out.

646
00:34:55,016 --> 00:34:56,427
- Dr. Greene?
- Don't worry, doc.

647
00:34:56,601 --> 00:34:59,139
- That means he never got there.
- Dr. Greene!

648
00:34:59,312 --> 00:35:01,638
He's coming in.

649
00:35:05,902 --> 00:35:09,236
Was that a record number
of gunshot wounds for one shift?

650
00:35:10,115 --> 00:35:12,440
By the same guy? Absolutely.

651
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:17,737
He has a good chance.
Like you said, you found it early.

652
00:35:17,914 --> 00:35:19,955
It's more that he has
to go through it alone, you know?

653
00:35:20,125 --> 00:35:22,451
As if having cancer as a kid
wasn't bad enough.

654
00:35:22,628 --> 00:35:24,786
He could get passed over
for Chief Resident.

655
00:35:24,963 --> 00:35:29,176
Or he could get kicked out of med school
and be forced to work as an ER nurse.

656
00:35:29,343 --> 00:35:31,631
- I was not kicked out.
- What would you call it?

657
00:35:31,804 --> 00:35:34,758
Suspended for being a deadbeat.

658
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:39,556
Do you know he offered
to pay my tuition?

659
00:35:39,728 --> 00:35:41,638
- Who?
- Luka.

660
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:47,016
And I know he means well.
It's just frustrating for me sometimes...

661
00:35:47,195 --> 00:35:49,318
...because I have to explain
my every feeling.

662
00:35:49,489 --> 00:35:53,985
And normally when you're with someone
for a while, they learn your moods.

663
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,733
- But he doesn't do that.
- You know what?

664
00:35:58,331 --> 00:36:01,082
- Stop it.
- What?

665
00:36:02,961 --> 00:36:05,202
Don't talk to me about Luka.

666
00:36:06,757 --> 00:36:08,630
I'm not your girlfriend.

667
00:36:09,259 --> 00:36:12,758
- And I shouldn't even be here with you.
- Why not?

668
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:19,718
Because I don't want to wish
bad things for you and Luka.

669
00:36:19,894 --> 00:36:24,189
And I don't want to sit on the sidelines
waiting for you two to break up.

670
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:28,816
And I don't want to be your friend.

671
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:33,774
It might be convenient for you,
but it's not doing much for me.

672
00:36:33,951 --> 00:36:36,359
What are you talking about?

673
00:36:57,851 --> 00:37:00,307
Where did you put him?
Where did you put my son?

674
00:37:00,478 --> 00:37:02,138
- How much O-neg do you want?
- Four units.

675
00:37:02,313 --> 00:37:05,065
- You can't take me from him!
- Quiet! So we can listen!

676
00:37:05,233 --> 00:37:07,273
- Two entrance wounds on the right.
- One on the left.

677
00:37:07,444 --> 00:37:09,400
Another two in the belly.
A total of five.

678
00:37:09,571 --> 00:37:11,694
You. You did this.

679
00:37:11,865 --> 00:37:14,700
Set up for bilateral chest tubes
and a central line.

680
00:37:14,868 --> 00:37:16,742
- Systolic's low at 80.
- I'll intubate.

681
00:37:16,912 --> 00:37:18,869
- This is your fault!
- Ready for the chest tubes.

682
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:23,119
Now. Paralyze.
One of Pavulon, 100 of sux.

683
00:37:23,293 --> 00:37:26,247
You stole my son.
You destroyed my family.

684
00:37:26,421 --> 00:37:27,797
Ambu-bag.

685
00:37:28,257 --> 00:37:32,206
He's my son!
What gives you the right to...?

686
00:37:34,221 --> 00:37:35,680
You can't take my son away!

687
00:37:36,098 --> 00:37:39,550
It starts with one bad cell that multiplies.
And then it grows out of control.

688
00:37:39,727 --> 00:37:44,389
You usually don't know it's there until
it is big enough that it causes pain.

689
00:37:44,565 --> 00:37:46,973
We're very lucky
that we found it today.

690
00:37:47,151 --> 00:37:49,558
So you're saying I'm lucky I got shot.

691
00:37:49,738 --> 00:37:51,196
In a way, yeah.

692
00:37:51,364 --> 00:37:53,605
It's just gonna take longer to die.

693
00:37:53,783 --> 00:37:55,526
No. That's what I'm telling you.

694
00:37:55,702 --> 00:37:58,453
Since we caught it early, there's
a good chance that you're not gonna die.

695
00:37:58,621 --> 00:38:00,744
What's a good chance?

696
00:38:00,915 --> 00:38:02,789
Seventy percent.

697
00:38:03,251 --> 00:38:06,702
- You know what 70 percent is?
- Yeah. It leaves 30.

698
00:38:06,879 --> 00:38:09,666
Well, let's concentrate on
the 70, okay?

699
00:38:09,841 --> 00:38:13,589
- Dr. Carter, GSW's rolling in.
- Okay. Be right there.

700
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,425
So, what happens to me now?

701
00:38:16,598 --> 00:38:20,513
Now I'm gonna have a cancer doctor, an
oncologist, come and take a look at you.

702
00:38:20,686 --> 00:38:23,093
No. I mean, where do I live?

703
00:38:24,982 --> 00:38:26,974
I don't know. I'll find out.

704
00:38:32,907 --> 00:38:34,863
When was your last tetanus booster?

705
00:38:35,033 --> 00:38:37,359
I don't know. Do I need an x-ray?

706
00:38:37,536 --> 00:38:39,825
- It looks like just a graze.
- Is that the guy?

707
00:38:39,997 --> 00:38:43,331
Yes. Multiple GSWs to the chest
and abdomen.

708
00:38:43,501 --> 00:38:46,170
At the range, they teach you to shoot
for the center mass.

709
00:38:46,337 --> 00:38:48,958
It's not always fatal
but it takes him down.

710
00:38:49,131 --> 00:38:52,417
- You shot him?
- I got mugged last year.

711
00:38:52,594 --> 00:38:55,594
Same park. I don't go there now
without protection.

712
00:38:56,806 --> 00:38:59,262
He started shooting people!
Someone had to do something!

713
00:38:59,434 --> 00:39:00,762
We should arm the whole city.

714
00:39:00,935 --> 00:39:03,687
Hey, I stopped him.
He would have kept going.

715
00:39:03,855 --> 00:39:06,227
- You're lucky.
- Lucky I was packing.

716
00:39:06,399 --> 00:39:08,522
- Carter, you free?
- Sort of.

717
00:39:08,694 --> 00:39:10,353
GSW to the right flank.

718
00:39:10,528 --> 00:39:13,482
Vitals are stable, but I need you
to check for gross hematuria.

719
00:39:13,656 --> 00:39:15,566
Okay. I'll be right there.

720
00:39:15,742 --> 00:39:16,822
- I handed it in to her.
- What?

721
00:39:16,994 --> 00:39:19,151
Your reference. Should put you
over the top. All fives.

722
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:20,788
- Wow! Thanks.
- I had to lie.

723
00:39:20,956 --> 00:39:22,865
- Now, Carter.
- Coming.

724
00:39:23,834 --> 00:39:24,865
First two are in.

725
00:39:25,043 --> 00:39:28,128
Another subclavian.
Put the next two on the infuser.

726
00:39:28,296 --> 00:39:31,713
- How's the chest tube output?
- Couple hundred cc's.

727
00:39:31,884 --> 00:39:34,884
- Only 50 on my side.
- Is he gonna make it?

728
00:39:35,053 --> 00:39:37,046
Probably.
Didn't hit any vital structures.

729
00:39:37,222 --> 00:39:39,974
- After five shots?
- Some guys get lucky.

730
00:39:40,142 --> 00:39:43,262
19 shot. Eight, maybe nine dead.
He's lucky we didn't take him down.

731
00:39:43,438 --> 00:39:47,102
- Dr. Greene, Dr. Corday's on line four.
- Could you get it for me?

732
00:39:47,274 --> 00:39:50,608
- Pressure's up to 85.
-3-0 nylon. What's in the Foley?

733
00:39:50,778 --> 00:39:55,155
Seventy cc's.
Dips are negative for heme.

734
00:39:55,324 --> 00:39:58,076
Can you cut this? Elizabeth?

735
00:39:58,244 --> 00:40:00,569
- Mark, what's going on?
- Where were you?

736
00:40:00,746 --> 00:40:01,909
I was at the Farmer's Market.

737
00:40:02,081 --> 00:40:05,367
There were police in the house
and the front door's been kicked in.

738
00:40:05,543 --> 00:40:07,037
- I told them to.
- Why?

739
00:40:07,211 --> 00:40:09,204
Long story. Vaseline gauze.

740
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:12,831
You're not gonna tell me
what happened?

741
00:40:13,009 --> 00:40:15,334
Nothing. It's just a bit of a scare.

742
00:40:15,511 --> 00:40:19,889
- You' re all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Call you later?

743
00:40:21,184 --> 00:40:24,849
- I told the police to stay until I called you.
- Yeah. Yeah, he can go now.

744
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:27,390
You' re not gonna tell me
what's going on?

745
00:40:28,066 --> 00:40:30,818
Not right now. Everything's okay.

746
00:40:30,986 --> 00:40:32,646
Okay, then.

747
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:36,946
- Will you be off at 7?
- Yes. I will be there.

748
00:40:37,451 --> 00:40:38,910
Okay.

749
00:40:39,704 --> 00:40:42,241
- I love you.
- Me too.

750
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:46,869
Elastoplast.

751
00:40:49,004 --> 00:40:50,547
Get ready for a portable chest.

752
00:40:50,715 --> 00:40:54,213
Keep the dopamine at 10 mics. Neuro
checks, 30 minutes. A CBC in an hour.

753
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:56,424
- Any cord contusion?
- No, extrinsic hematoma.

754
00:40:56,595 --> 00:40:58,338
- Did they find Elizabeth?
- She's fine.

755
00:40:58,515 --> 00:41:00,720
- Good.
- What about her paralysis?

756
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:05,269
- Ask me in 24 hours. What's this?
- GSW to the renal parenchyma.

757
00:41:05,438 --> 00:41:07,894
Marge, clear OR 2.
We got another customer.

758
00:41:08,066 --> 00:41:09,525
I'll be right back.

759
00:41:09,692 --> 00:41:12,978
- Robert, I need to talk to you.
- Yeah, sure. Anything but Legaspi.

760
00:41:13,155 --> 00:41:14,898
You're making a mistake.

761
00:41:15,073 --> 00:41:18,774
My main mistake was not firing her
three months ago when I first found out.

762
00:41:18,952 --> 00:41:20,576
- What?
- That she is incompetent.

763
00:41:20,745 --> 00:41:23,236
- That's not what you were gonna say.
- Really?

764
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:26,166
In addition to your diagnostic skills,
you're a mind reader.

765
00:41:26,334 --> 00:41:29,170
- It's because she's gay.
- Of course I'm not.

766
00:41:29,338 --> 00:41:31,295
That would be politically incorrect.

767
00:41:31,464 --> 00:41:33,042
She's a pain in the ass.

768
00:41:33,217 --> 00:41:35,339
Like Maggie Doyle was?

769
00:41:35,844 --> 00:41:39,094
- Let's stop right there.
- And avoid your history of discrimination?

770
00:41:39,264 --> 00:41:42,598
If you don't rethink this, there's a good
chance you'll be out of a job.

771
00:41:42,768 --> 00:41:45,473
Dr. Legaspi has demonstrated
not only poor judgment...

772
00:41:45,646 --> 00:41:49,395
...but a reckless attitude towards patients
and a blatant disregard for authority.

773
00:41:49,567 --> 00:41:53,018
She's out. She's fired.
End of discussion.

774
00:41:55,697 --> 00:41:56,943
- If she goes, I go.
- What?

775
00:41:57,116 --> 00:41:58,574
You heard me.

776
00:41:59,535 --> 00:42:01,907
- Are you giving me an ultimatum?
- I swear to God.

777
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:05,282
- I will walk out if you don't back off.
- I do not respond well to ultimatums!

778
00:42:05,458 --> 00:42:08,329
You had better choose your battles
very carefully!

779
00:42:08,503 --> 00:42:11,373
You're the Chief of Emergency Medicine,
not the county's lesbian advocate.

780
00:42:11,547 --> 00:42:13,457
That's where you're wrong.
Because I am both.

781
00:42:13,633 --> 00:42:16,420
I am the Chief of Emergency Medicine,
and I am a lesbian.

782
00:42:16,594 --> 00:42:21,007
If you pursue this matter, I will take it
to the County Board of Supervisors...

783
00:42:21,182 --> 00:42:24,219
...the ACLU, the press,
and anyone else who will listen!

784
00:42:24,394 --> 00:42:28,522
So I suggest you choose
your battles very carefully!

785
00:42:47,251 --> 00:42:50,584
- BP's 100/60.
- Going in the right direction.

786
00:42:50,754 --> 00:42:53,043
- Last HemoCue?
-9.5.

787
00:42:53,215 --> 00:42:55,125
You want me to bring him up?

788
00:42:56,051 --> 00:42:57,594
- Mark?
- What?

789
00:42:57,762 --> 00:43:00,335
- You want me to bring him up?
- No, no. I got it.

790
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,762
They are sending cross-matched
blood to the OR.

791
00:43:02,934 --> 00:43:03,964
Good.

792
00:43:04,143 --> 00:43:06,468
Could you bring the chart back down
so I can write my note?

793
00:43:06,645 --> 00:43:08,306
Sure.

794
00:43:09,065 --> 00:43:11,188
He's gonna need some more Pavulon.

795
00:43:12,902 --> 00:43:16,434
Damn it! I forgot the drug box.
Be right back.
