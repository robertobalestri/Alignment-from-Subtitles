1
00:00:04,903 --> 00:00:06,203
Shaun?

2
00:00:06,238 --> 00:00:08,239
Oh, hello, Dr. Glassman.

3
00:00:08,306 --> 00:00:10,007
If you're here to
talk about our argument...

4
00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:12,113
I am, kind of, in a way.

5
00:00:13,545 --> 00:00:14,845
Working under Salen

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,082
was making me into a bad doctor,
so I quit.

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,518
I'm creating a spreadsheet
of residency programs.

8
00:00:20,552 --> 00:00:22,753
I have 12 metrics.

9
00:00:22,821 --> 00:00:24,388
Well, Shaun, that's a problem,

10
00:00:24,422 --> 00:00:27,224
because there aren't
a lot of programs around

11
00:00:27,259 --> 00:00:29,714
that are gonna take a
resident at your level.

12
00:00:30,028 --> 00:00:32,062
And also...

13
00:00:32,097 --> 00:00:35,219
You're somewhat vulnerable
because of the ASD.

14
00:00:36,501 --> 00:00:38,169
I've already quit.

15
00:00:38,203 --> 00:00:39,870
We got a plan, Shaunie.

16
00:00:39,905 --> 00:00:42,439
We are talking to
an investigative reporter

17
00:00:42,507 --> 00:00:46,110
for a story on the damage that
Salen has done to St. Bon's.

18
00:00:46,178 --> 00:00:48,045
It'll put pressure on the Pension Fund

19
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,247
that's financing the hospital takeover.

20
00:00:50,282 --> 00:00:52,850
The deal doesn't close for eight days.

21
00:00:52,884 --> 00:00:54,447
We still have time to stop it.

22
00:00:55,787 --> 00:00:58,622
We think you should apologize to Salen

23
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,412
and ask for your job back.

24
00:01:02,594 --> 00:01:05,291
Apologize. Save your career.

25
00:01:07,132 --> 00:01:08,299
She will not say yes.

26
00:01:08,366 --> 00:01:09,934
Oh, she will say yes.

27
00:01:09,968 --> 00:01:11,769
You're on the poster.
What's she gonna do,

28
00:01:11,803 --> 00:01:14,026
drag you out of the hospital
kicking and screaming?

29
00:01:14,094 --> 00:01:15,539
It'd be a PR disaster.

30
00:01:15,574 --> 00:01:17,741
I have nothing to apologize for.
She does.

31
00:01:17,776 --> 00:01:21,265
We agree, but if we pull this off,
it is only for eight days.

32
00:01:22,814 --> 00:01:24,315
But what if you don't?

33
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:29,273
If we don't, then we rethink.

34
00:01:33,325 --> 00:01:37,239
I will focus on the medicine.

35
00:01:42,067 --> 00:01:44,768
We've got a morale problem
at the hospital.

36
00:01:44,803 --> 00:01:47,605
Maybe it's just aftershocks from
what happened with the baby,

37
00:01:47,639 --> 00:01:49,173
but I'm hearing a lot of complaints.

38
00:01:49,241 --> 00:01:50,741
Even the board's unhappy.

39
00:01:50,775 --> 00:01:53,911
Which is why I plan to replace
them as soon as the deal closes.

40
00:01:53,945 --> 00:01:56,580
Well, good doctors are a lot harder
to replace than board members.

41
00:01:56,615 --> 00:01:59,984
Any employees we lose, we'll find
others better aligned with Ethicure.

42
00:02:00,018 --> 00:02:02,186
We've got a lot of great people at St.
Bon's,

43
00:02:02,254 --> 00:02:04,100
and I'd like to make
an effort to keep them.

44
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:06,435
How's your morale?

45
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:08,959
I'm fine.

46
00:02:09,355 --> 00:02:10,995
I know yesterday was tough,

47
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:12,775
the tracheal transplant.

48
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,499
I hope you aren't doubting yourself.

49
00:02:15,533 --> 00:02:17,405
Shaun warned me. I didn't listen.

50
00:02:17,869 --> 00:02:19,670
You took a risk,

51
00:02:19,704 --> 00:02:22,118
and your patient is better off for that.

52
00:02:23,475 --> 00:02:25,009
And now you and I are gonna make this

53
00:02:25,043 --> 00:02:27,811
the most successful hospital
in the Bay Area.

54
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,551
No headaches, dizziness?

55
00:02:34,619 --> 00:02:36,553
No. I feel fine now.

56
00:02:36,621 --> 00:02:37,988
Blurry vision?

57
00:02:38,023 --> 00:02:39,857
Dr. Murphy, why are you here?

58
00:02:39,891 --> 00:02:42,226
I'm focusing on the medicine.

59
00:02:42,294 --> 00:02:44,128
I don't have any patients of my own.

60
00:02:44,162 --> 00:02:45,496
Probably because you quit yesterday.

61
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:46,830
Have you spoken to Salen?

62
00:02:46,865 --> 00:02:49,533
This says you lost
consciousness while running

63
00:02:49,567 --> 00:02:50,734
and hit your head.

64
00:02:50,802 --> 00:02:52,469
Uh, yep.

65
00:02:52,504 --> 00:02:54,138
And no. No blurry vision.

66
00:02:54,172 --> 00:02:55,806
You recently flew in from London.

67
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,708
Perhaps your fatigue or dehydration...

68
00:02:57,742 --> 00:02:59,143
It was three days post-flight,

69
00:02:59,177 --> 00:03:01,412
and the liver function tests
are only slightly elevated

70
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:03,180
despite receiving a donor
liver six months back.

71
00:03:03,214 --> 00:03:04,882
It doesn't seem transplant-related.

72
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:06,817
Well, it was a very high-quality liver.

73
00:03:06,851 --> 00:03:08,706
From an even higher-quality person.

74
00:03:09,154 --> 00:03:11,021
You're the donor?

75
00:03:11,056 --> 00:03:13,223
Ry's been my best friend
since kindergarten.

76
00:03:13,258 --> 00:03:16,393
I was about to die,
with my wife seven months pregnant.

77
00:03:16,428 --> 00:03:19,467
He immediately stepped up. Total hero.

78
00:03:21,266 --> 00:03:22,386
Definitely is.

79
00:03:23,068 --> 00:03:24,401
We'll schedule a head CT

80
00:03:24,436 --> 00:03:25,703
to look for damage from your fall,

81
00:03:25,737 --> 00:03:27,396
as well as any reason why you fainted.

82
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,540
Great. I'm sure it'll be fine. Yeah.

83
00:03:29,574 --> 00:03:31,395
If not, good news.
You get your liver back.

84
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,577
That's not how it works.

85
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,124
What are you doing here?

86
00:03:47,192 --> 00:03:49,026
I work here.

87
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,361
That's not what I took away

88
00:03:50,395 --> 00:03:52,096
from our conversation last night.

89
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:55,127
Last night, I wanted to quit.
Today, I don't.

90
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,171
You need to leave.

91
00:03:58,103 --> 00:03:59,803
Now.

92
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,273
No.

93
00:04:03,308 --> 00:04:06,222
It's not a suggestion. Goodbye.

94
00:04:07,812 --> 00:04:08,946
No.

95
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:17,358
I am on the poster.

96
00:04:19,557 --> 00:04:24,294
You will not drag me out of the
hospital kicking and screaming.

97
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:27,598
It would be a PR disaster.
So I'm staying.

98
00:04:31,236 --> 00:04:33,604
I have to go to work.

99
00:04:38,371 --> 00:04:46,371
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

100
00:04:46,684 --> 00:04:48,485
When did the bleeding start?

101
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,057
About an hour ago.

102
00:04:50,989 --> 00:04:52,856
Any dizziness or nausea?

103
00:04:52,924 --> 00:04:56,593
None. I told her that some
spotting was normal.

104
00:04:56,628 --> 00:04:59,630
This is my last viable embryo.

105
00:04:59,664 --> 00:05:01,665
I've had more miscarriages
than I can count.

106
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:04,505
I've done this five times already.

107
00:05:04,836 --> 00:05:06,407
The baby is... Is fine.

108
00:05:07,597 --> 00:05:09,999
You all have five kids at home?
You are experts.

109
00:05:10,024 --> 00:05:12,329
No, we're not a couple.

110
00:05:13,511 --> 00:05:15,291
I actually don't have
any children of my own.

111
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,781
Grace is my surrogate.

112
00:05:17,816 --> 00:05:21,685
Is it typical for surrogates and
their clients to hang out together?

113
00:05:21,719 --> 00:05:26,123
She has become more like family now.

114
00:05:27,859 --> 00:05:29,972
That's a healthy heartbeat.

115
00:05:34,165 --> 00:05:36,187
S-Something is wrong.

116
00:05:37,202 --> 00:05:39,736
MRI abdomen and transvaginal ultrasound.

117
00:05:46,878 --> 00:05:49,491
No intracranial bleed, no tumor.

118
00:05:52,984 --> 00:05:56,353
I assume you know some of us
are going public against Ethicure.

119
00:05:56,387 --> 00:05:59,423
Dr. Glassman and Lea told me,

120
00:05:59,491 --> 00:06:01,992
but they think I should stay out of it.

121
00:06:02,026 --> 00:06:03,422
What do you want to do?

122
00:06:07,499 --> 00:06:09,533
Is it possible

123
00:06:09,567 --> 00:06:11,902
to be sure what the right thing is,

124
00:06:11,936 --> 00:06:14,271
but it's also wrong to act on it?

125
00:06:16,441 --> 00:06:17,937
All too often.

126
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:23,914
And whatever happens,

127
00:06:23,948 --> 00:06:25,516
I know you're on our side.

128
00:06:29,854 --> 00:06:31,922
Scan seems to be clear.

129
00:06:31,956 --> 00:06:33,690
Then why is he having a seizure?

130
00:06:39,564 --> 00:06:41,365
Grace's scans look normal.

131
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:43,254
No placenta accreta or previa.

132
00:06:44,602 --> 00:06:46,370
I love what she's doing,

133
00:06:46,404 --> 00:06:48,801
carrying a child for a woman who can't.

134
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,763
I'd love it more if Grace
wasn't getting paid for it.

135
00:06:54,245 --> 00:06:55,879
She created five families.

136
00:06:55,914 --> 00:06:57,314
Do you really have a problem with that?

137
00:06:57,382 --> 00:06:58,901
It's not just me.

138
00:06:58,936 --> 00:07:00,884
Commercial surrogacy is illegal

139
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:03,053
pretty much everywhere but here.

140
00:07:03,087 --> 00:07:04,621
It's exploitative.

141
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:06,490
Funny how everyone gets real concerned

142
00:07:06,558 --> 00:07:09,126
about exploitation
when it's women's bodies.

143
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,996
Meanwhile, football players give
themselves brain damage every Sunday,

144
00:07:13,021 --> 00:07:14,388
and it's glorified.

145
00:07:16,234 --> 00:07:17,663
Point taken.

146
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:19,169
You know, it's not too late

147
00:07:19,237 --> 00:07:21,772
to change your mind
about this Salen stuff.

148
00:07:21,806 --> 00:07:23,507
You should join us.

149
00:07:23,575 --> 00:07:25,671
Speaking of men telling
women what to do...

150
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,342
Look at this.

151
00:07:36,955 --> 00:07:38,255
<i>I've had to send children</i>

152
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:39,990
<i>to community transition care units</i>

153
00:07:40,024 --> 00:07:42,292
<i>because of how she's
minimized pediatric beds.</i>

154
00:07:42,327 --> 00:07:43,627
That's his testimony?

155
00:07:43,661 --> 00:07:45,128
It's the start of his testimony.

156
00:07:45,163 --> 00:07:47,598
The plan being to bore
them into submission?

157
00:07:47,632 --> 00:07:50,033
My plan is to let them know
exactly what she's done

158
00:07:50,101 --> 00:07:52,102
and how it's impacted
the greater community.

159
00:07:53,438 --> 00:07:54,871
Oh, it's the pizza guy.

160
00:07:54,939 --> 00:07:57,541
Infant fatality. That's our plan.

161
00:07:57,609 --> 00:07:59,643
- Let's stick to that.
- We can't prove that.

162
00:07:59,677 --> 00:08:01,044
But what we do have
are doctors and nurses

163
00:08:01,112 --> 00:08:03,013
and stories of systemic neglect.

164
00:08:03,047 --> 00:08:04,615
It's not the pizza guy.

165
00:08:04,649 --> 00:08:06,587
Don't worry. I tipped him.

166
00:08:07,318 --> 00:08:08,589
I love your place.

167
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,091
Smart play.

168
00:08:11,863 --> 00:08:12,896
That's what I'd do.

169
00:08:13,476 --> 00:08:15,577
Yeah? What play is that?

170
00:08:16,561 --> 00:08:18,161
Getting that investigative reporter

171
00:08:18,196 --> 00:08:19,663
to write a takedown piece about me

172
00:08:19,697 --> 00:08:22,478
and using that
to pressure the Pension Fund.

173
00:08:23,901 --> 00:08:25,535
Dr. Wolke, Dr. Park,

174
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:28,192
it's time for you two
residents to get back to work.

175
00:08:29,674 --> 00:08:32,209
- I'm not leaving.
- Me neither.

176
00:08:32,243 --> 00:08:34,511
Gutsy, coming from a second-year

177
00:08:34,545 --> 00:08:37,014
who already killed a patient.

178
00:08:37,048 --> 00:08:39,016
And you really ought to take
lessons from your girlfriend.

179
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,704
She knows how to play the game.

180
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,389
Audrey, Lea, Aaron, I'm sorry,

181
00:08:45,423 --> 00:08:48,504
but I have to terminate
your employment immediately.

182
00:08:49,661 --> 00:08:51,006
You were saying?

183
00:08:53,496 --> 00:08:54,510
Go.

184
00:08:57,013 --> 00:08:58,124
Go.

185
00:09:03,941 --> 00:09:05,208
That your plan?

186
00:09:05,243 --> 00:09:09,179
Make us look like disgruntled
former employees?

187
00:09:09,213 --> 00:09:11,581
You think that's gonna stop us
from going public?

188
00:09:11,616 --> 00:09:13,309
No, of course not.

189
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:16,990
But... I think this research will.

190
00:09:18,488 --> 00:09:22,246
Despite your generous salary,
you were a no-show for months,

191
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,962
making wine in your garage,
vacationing in Montana.

192
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,864
All after years of intervening

193
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:31,797
to excuse your protege
Dr. Murphy's erratic behavior.

194
00:09:33,371 --> 00:09:35,238
You hired your boyfriend,

195
00:09:35,273 --> 00:09:38,208
then fired him
once the relationship soured.

196
00:09:38,242 --> 00:09:39,943
Classic sexual harassment.

197
00:09:39,977 --> 00:09:41,778
That's not... H-He quit.

198
00:09:41,813 --> 00:09:45,048
You secretly changed hospital metrics

199
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,104
to help your fiance.

200
00:09:49,153 --> 00:09:51,859
Right now, you've only lost your jobs.

201
00:09:52,716 --> 00:09:53,783
Go public,

202
00:09:54,726 --> 00:09:57,281
and I release all this.

203
00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:03,245
Cheat day.

204
00:10:18,777 --> 00:10:21,035
J.L., Hawks, and Colson are out.

205
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,947
The reporter?

206
00:10:23,014 --> 00:10:25,549
She'll still talk to us.
It's still a good story.

207
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:27,917
Just much shorter than planned.

208
00:10:29,788 --> 00:10:32,690
Was she right? Are we wasting our time?

209
00:10:32,724 --> 00:10:34,257
Probably.

210
00:10:37,295 --> 00:10:39,930
The Pension Fund's annual
meeting is in two days, right?

211
00:10:39,965 --> 00:10:41,265
Yeah.

212
00:10:41,299 --> 00:10:43,434
We meet the reporter there.
Big public setting.

213
00:10:43,468 --> 00:10:45,852
Denounce Salen
in front of the investors.

214
00:10:46,638 --> 00:10:47,872
Create a viral moment.

215
00:10:47,906 --> 00:10:49,406
That might do some damage.

216
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:54,027
She could ruin me in tech.

217
00:10:57,382 --> 00:10:58,449
I'm in.

218
00:11:04,222 --> 00:11:07,625
You're threatening to ruin their
careers? These are good doctors.

219
00:11:07,659 --> 00:11:10,294
Who've decided to try to
interfere with my company.

220
00:11:10,328 --> 00:11:12,329
You can't expect me to just accept that.

221
00:11:12,397 --> 00:11:14,064
I've backed you at every step

222
00:11:14,099 --> 00:11:16,901
because I believe a great
hospital could be profitable, too.

223
00:11:16,935 --> 00:11:18,968
But blackmail is unacceptable.

224
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,174
Think big picture.

225
00:11:24,582 --> 00:11:27,017
We just lost the president
of the hospital.

226
00:11:27,746 --> 00:11:28,979
You're running this place.

227
00:11:29,014 --> 00:11:30,447
Short-term.

228
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,116
The future is wide open.

229
00:11:34,085 --> 00:11:35,318
For both of us.

230
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,407
Where's Dr. Lim?

231
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,028
She's no longer available.

232
00:11:44,095 --> 00:11:45,829
But I'm the Chief of Surgery

233
00:11:45,864 --> 00:11:48,299
and will be personally
involved in your case.

234
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,035
Unfortunately,
your imaging is consistent

235
00:11:51,102 --> 00:11:53,503
with a bladder sarcoma
abutting your uterus.

236
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,089
Cancer?

237
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:59,376
But we did surrogacy testing.

238
00:11:59,444 --> 00:12:02,379
It's small right now, but it will
continue to grow as the fetus does.

239
00:12:02,447 --> 00:12:03,681
Oh, God.

240
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:05,716
And what can we do?

241
00:12:05,784 --> 00:12:07,718
The safest option

242
00:12:07,786 --> 00:12:09,853
is to terminate the pregnancy,
resect the tumor,

243
00:12:09,888 --> 00:12:11,312
and begin chemotherapy.

244
00:12:13,658 --> 00:12:15,608
Are there any other options?

245
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,899
There are a number
of chemotherapy protocols

246
00:12:21,967 --> 00:12:24,234
that are safe for
second trimester fetuses.

247
00:12:24,302 --> 00:12:25,803
But they'll all be far less effective

248
00:12:25,837 --> 00:12:28,205
against the cancer than surgery.

249
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,960
I want to do the chemo.

250
00:12:34,412 --> 00:12:35,628
Grace...

251
00:12:37,482 --> 00:12:38,515
Are you sure?

252
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,303
Yes.

253
00:12:46,024 --> 00:12:47,891
- So...
- I heard.

254
00:12:47,926 --> 00:12:49,526
You're lucky to still have a job.

255
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:51,686
Well, I'm not sure if it's luck or you.

256
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:54,264
Salen suggested I learn
to play the game like you do.

257
00:12:54,332 --> 00:12:55,399
She's right.

258
00:12:57,102 --> 00:12:59,736
I didn't realize
being a doctor was a game.

259
00:13:00,705 --> 00:13:02,822
Why are you obsessing about this?

260
00:13:04,542 --> 00:13:05,867
We have a meeting.

261
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,173
I'm sure all of you have feelings

262
00:13:10,201 --> 00:13:12,202
about what happened with our colleagues.

263
00:13:12,384 --> 00:13:13,550
Shaun, if you want to talk...

264
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:15,501
Ryan has encephalitis.

265
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:20,882
Lea is okay.
I'm focusing on the medicine.

266
00:13:23,228 --> 00:13:25,062
You said his head CT was clean.

267
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:27,097
Our scan was interrupted by his seizure.

268
00:13:27,132 --> 00:13:29,199
I went back and reviewed the images.

269
00:13:29,234 --> 00:13:30,734
There appears to be hypodensity

270
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,369
in the bilateral medial temporal lobes.

271
00:13:32,404 --> 00:13:35,105
Interesting. Suggests HSV.

272
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,940
That's just artifact from skull base.
It's not encephalitis.

273
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:42,111
Clean CT plus clean blood test
suggests a cardiac problem.

274
00:13:43,715 --> 00:13:45,482
I'm with Dr. Park.
Place Ryan on telemetry and...

275
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,717
You should trust me.

276
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,954
I told you not to
do that surgery yesterday.

277
00:13:50,989 --> 00:13:53,290
I was right then, and I am right now.

278
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:04,568
No reason not to rule out
encephalitis, as well.

279
00:14:04,602 --> 00:14:07,004
Start him on acyclovir in
addition to the cardiac monitor.

280
00:14:13,511 --> 00:14:14,978
We could try Ifosfamide.

281
00:14:15,013 --> 00:14:17,081
Lim and the others are speaking out

282
00:14:17,115 --> 00:14:19,249
at the annual Pension Fund
meeting the day after tomorrow.

283
00:14:19,284 --> 00:14:21,685
Please help me find
a chemo regimen for Grace.

284
00:14:21,753 --> 00:14:23,778
Okay, Ifosfamide
can cause pre-term labor.

285
00:14:25,623 --> 00:14:27,191
I'm gonna go with Adriamycin.

286
00:14:27,258 --> 00:14:28,533
I'm gonna speak out with them.

287
00:14:29,461 --> 00:14:30,861
That's gonna blow up your whole career.

288
00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:32,703
Blow up your whole life.

289
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:35,289
Wouldn't be the first time.

290
00:14:36,868 --> 00:14:39,169
Come with us. You're great at sales.

291
00:14:39,204 --> 00:14:41,972
Help us persuade the Pension Fund.

292
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,340
Sometimes you got to stand up
for what's right.

293
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:47,611
What I do or do not stand up for

294
00:14:47,645 --> 00:14:49,780
is my choice,

295
00:14:49,814 --> 00:14:53,050
and my friends should respect that.

296
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:58,771
What have you come up with?

297
00:14:59,724 --> 00:15:02,192
There are a few options...

298
00:15:03,328 --> 00:15:04,695
Grace is crashing.

299
00:15:10,502 --> 00:15:12,369
I'm going to test you for encephalitis

300
00:15:12,403 --> 00:15:15,072
and place you on telemetry
to check for heart problems.

301
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,620
Okay.

302
00:15:17,575 --> 00:15:20,644
Is your neck bothering you?

303
00:15:20,678 --> 00:15:23,080
Y-Yeah. It just started
feeling a little weird.

304
00:15:23,148 --> 00:15:25,923
Okay, can you take your gown
off your shoulders, please?

305
00:15:34,325 --> 00:15:35,892
W-What is that?

306
00:15:36,594 --> 00:15:39,687
Not encephalitis or a heart problem.

307
00:15:46,644 --> 00:15:48,978
You had a uterine vessel rupture.

308
00:15:49,614 --> 00:15:51,281
We were able to treat it,

309
00:15:51,315 --> 00:15:54,024
but your cancer's progressing
quicker than we thought.

310
00:15:54,986 --> 00:15:57,721
Our recommendation is to terminate.

311
00:15:57,788 --> 00:16:01,448
We'll remove the tumor
and reconstruct your bladder.

312
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:05,395
But you said

313
00:16:05,463 --> 00:16:09,499
there was a chemotherapy
that was safe for the baby.

314
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:12,335
The rupture made
everything more serious.

315
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,070
You need surgery now,

316
00:16:14,138 --> 00:16:16,297
or the cancer might kill you.

317
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:22,178
If you don't want to terminate,

318
00:16:22,213 --> 00:16:25,682
there is an experimental
cystoscopic surgery.

319
00:16:25,716 --> 00:16:28,601
It should be able to clear
almost all of the cancer.

320
00:16:29,587 --> 00:16:33,522
W-What...
What are the risks to the baby?

321
00:16:35,326 --> 00:16:36,893
30% chance of miscarriage.

322
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,464
Gracie.

323
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:44,074
Gracie.

324
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:47,797
It's okay.

325
00:16:49,726 --> 00:16:51,248
You should terminate.

326
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,411
You should do the surgery

327
00:16:54,445 --> 00:16:56,962
that gets rid of all of the cancer.

328
00:17:09,694 --> 00:17:11,644
I'd like to do the chemo.

329
00:17:19,603 --> 00:17:22,072
You realize you probably won't survive.

330
00:17:27,411 --> 00:17:29,980
As long as the baby reaches viability.

331
00:17:30,047 --> 00:17:33,832
Gracie, honey, you don't
have to do this for me.

332
00:17:37,288 --> 00:17:38,922
I'm not.

333
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:01,568
I went through
some of your recent cases.

334
00:18:02,413 --> 00:18:04,247
W-Why?

335
00:18:04,281 --> 00:18:05,849
Because of what Salen said.

336
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:08,818
You know she likes me.
What's the problem with her liking me?

337
00:18:08,853 --> 00:18:10,661
Because of your paranoid reaction.

338
00:18:11,489 --> 00:18:13,289
I reacted because it seemed like

339
00:18:13,324 --> 00:18:15,091
you were reading something
into her comment.

340
00:18:15,126 --> 00:18:17,127
Like you didn't trust me.

341
00:18:17,161 --> 00:18:18,762
And now you're going through my files?

342
00:18:18,796 --> 00:18:21,130
Apparently, I'm not paranoid.

343
00:18:22,633 --> 00:18:24,675
Nira Joseph.

344
00:18:27,138 --> 00:18:29,205
I didn't realize "playing the game"

345
00:18:29,273 --> 00:18:31,508
is shorthand for losing
your entire moral compass.

346
00:18:31,542 --> 00:18:34,644
Nira is half-blind because of you.

347
00:18:36,647 --> 00:18:38,014
She had a tumor...

348
00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:39,549
There is no mention in her file

349
00:18:39,617 --> 00:18:42,452
of the procedure that
could have saved her sight.

350
00:18:42,486 --> 00:18:45,188
A procedure you thought
wasn't a viable idea.

351
00:18:45,222 --> 00:18:46,723
I didn't tell you to hide it.

352
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:49,059
You can't offer every patient
every experimental surgery...

353
00:18:49,126 --> 00:18:51,995
Ah, especially not when "we're"
trying to win control of the clinic.

354
00:18:53,998 --> 00:18:56,966
It was the right choice medically.

355
00:18:57,001 --> 00:18:59,569
It was her choice.

356
00:19:14,385 --> 00:19:16,519
Ryan's rash plus seizure and fainting

357
00:19:16,554 --> 00:19:18,188
suggests an autoimmune disorder.

358
00:19:18,222 --> 00:19:20,056
Makes sense. His ESR's elevated.

359
00:19:20,091 --> 00:19:22,592
ESR's a nonspecific inflammatory marker.

360
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,227
Wouldn't matter
if it was through the roof.

361
00:19:26,664 --> 00:19:29,031
Dr. Park,
are you taking offense at the diagnosis?

362
00:19:30,234 --> 00:19:32,618
Salen fired our friends.

363
00:19:34,505 --> 00:19:37,040
I didn't know about that in advance,
didn't support it.

364
00:19:37,074 --> 00:19:38,541
And do you support it now?

365
00:19:38,576 --> 00:19:40,677
It doesn't matter what he supports.
He's not the CEO.

366
00:19:40,711 --> 00:19:42,586
No, he's just her bagman.

367
00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:48,218
Salen came into this hospital
because it was going bankrupt.

368
00:19:48,252 --> 00:19:51,287
And now it's become Salen's ATM machine.
That's an improvement?

369
00:19:51,355 --> 00:19:53,022
You have been against her
from the moment she came in.

370
00:19:53,057 --> 00:19:54,457
Just proven right.

371
00:19:54,525 --> 00:19:56,793
You're not facing reality.
The takeover's happening.

372
00:19:56,861 --> 00:19:58,528
Someone's got to keep
the hospital running.

373
00:19:58,562 --> 00:20:01,564
You think you're being realistic?
You're being complicit.

374
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:04,367
We should start Ryan on
corticosteroids for the autoimmune...

375
00:20:04,401 --> 00:20:06,035
Don't you see how being her
apologists is corrupting you?

376
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,237
Dr. Park...

377
00:20:07,271 --> 00:20:09,405
You took a woman's vision away

378
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,989
to get your hands on the clinic.

379
00:20:11,475 --> 00:20:12,809
Not fair.

380
00:20:12,877 --> 00:20:15,612
And you stand by her
after she kills a child.

381
00:20:15,646 --> 00:20:19,039
Dr. Park, do you have
an alternative diagnosis?

382
00:20:21,785 --> 00:20:22,719
No.

383
00:20:24,054 --> 00:20:25,955
Start Ryan on corticosteroids.

384
00:20:30,594 --> 00:20:31,794
I'm done.

385
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:37,634
I'll finish up with my patients

386
00:20:37,668 --> 00:20:39,935
and then submit my resignation.

387
00:20:48,646 --> 00:20:50,146
If I get a job downtown,

388
00:20:50,181 --> 00:20:52,482
this would be a good place
to meet for lunch.

389
00:20:52,516 --> 00:20:54,918
They have great French pancakes.
Kind of eggy, but...

390
00:20:54,952 --> 00:20:56,201
I should join you.

391
00:20:58,756 --> 00:21:01,191
Lea, I'm the poster boy.

392
00:21:01,258 --> 00:21:04,460
It made Salen take me back.
It could make the difference.

393
00:21:04,495 --> 00:21:06,129
It'll make a difference, sure, but...

394
00:21:06,163 --> 00:21:07,363
That's good enough.

395
00:21:07,431 --> 00:21:09,432
You are so close to
finishing your residency.

396
00:21:09,466 --> 00:21:11,800
One more year,
and you can go wherever you want.

397
00:21:13,837 --> 00:21:15,638
Dr. Glassman,

398
00:21:15,673 --> 00:21:17,264
Park,

399
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:21,602
Lim, they've stood up
for me so many times.

400
00:21:23,514 --> 00:21:27,684
You've stood up for me so many times.

401
00:21:31,455 --> 00:21:33,556
Now I want to stand up for all of you.

402
00:21:38,229 --> 00:21:39,662
Okay.

403
00:21:54,011 --> 00:21:57,475
Okay, can you make fun of my
beard or my eye bags or anything?

404
00:21:57,499 --> 00:21:59,264
I hate this.

405
00:21:59,917 --> 00:22:02,876
How many times did I say
I didn't want to get involved

406
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,220
in the Salen stuff?

407
00:22:04,255 --> 00:22:05,822
But you still kept pushing.

408
00:22:05,856 --> 00:22:08,891
I wanted you on my side.

409
00:22:08,926 --> 00:22:11,109
You act like I'm scared of a fight.

410
00:22:13,897 --> 00:22:15,146
I'm a Black woman

411
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:18,768
in one of the
top surgical residencies in the country.

412
00:22:18,836 --> 00:22:21,578
Do you know how hard
I had to fight to be here?

413
00:22:22,373 --> 00:22:24,289
I don't have the same luxury as you do.

414
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:26,242
I'm not scared.

415
00:22:26,277 --> 00:22:27,510
I'm exhausted.

416
00:22:31,782 --> 00:22:33,840
I never thought of it that way.

417
00:22:37,521 --> 00:22:38,887
I'm sorry.

418
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,460
Thank you.

419
00:22:51,869 --> 00:22:54,945
And I think I know
who Grace is fighting for.

420
00:22:56,707 --> 00:22:59,142
She said she didn't have
any children of her own.

421
00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:05,192
But you had to have given birth
before you became a surrogate.

422
00:23:21,306 --> 00:23:23,073
We know what happened to Willem.

423
00:23:28,246 --> 00:23:29,613
It wasn't your fault.

424
00:23:31,883 --> 00:23:35,117
What kind of a mother loses
track of her baby at a playground?

425
00:23:36,321 --> 00:23:37,621
A 19-year-old.

426
00:23:39,391 --> 00:23:40,956
Who's overwhelmed.

427
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,750
I wasn't overwhelmed.

428
00:23:46,765 --> 00:23:49,297
I wasn't paying attention.

429
00:23:55,407 --> 00:23:59,057
I was arguing on the phone
with my boyfriend.

430
00:24:00,999 --> 00:24:03,634
And I turned... I turned my back.

431
00:24:08,442 --> 00:24:11,188
The crash was so loud.

432
00:24:17,162 --> 00:24:18,577
So now,

433
00:24:19,597 --> 00:24:23,957
I give babies to people
who actually deserve them.

434
00:24:27,205 --> 00:24:29,306
Killing yourself

435
00:24:29,341 --> 00:24:31,631
won't bring Willem back.

436
00:24:34,813 --> 00:24:36,803
It'll let another baby live.

437
00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:40,517
You have value,

438
00:24:40,552 --> 00:24:43,059
not just in the children you carry.

439
00:24:46,311 --> 00:24:49,983
I lost myself when Willem died.

440
00:24:51,329 --> 00:24:53,445
This is what brought me back.

441
00:24:56,914 --> 00:25:01,495
It is the only thing
that means anything to me.

442
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,602
You're being selfish.

443
00:25:07,712 --> 00:25:09,211
This isn't just about you.

444
00:25:10,315 --> 00:25:12,349
It's also about Amanda,

445
00:25:12,384 --> 00:25:15,175
your friend, who loves you.

446
00:25:16,888 --> 00:25:18,322
I'm trying to help her...

447
00:25:18,356 --> 00:25:20,557
No. You're not listening to her.

448
00:25:20,592 --> 00:25:24,351
She does not want the price
of her child to be your life.

449
00:25:29,067 --> 00:25:30,732
You don't have to terminate.

450
00:25:31,903 --> 00:25:35,111
Just let us do the cystoscopic surgery.

451
00:25:36,408 --> 00:25:39,199
It could let Amanda have her baby...

452
00:25:41,012 --> 00:25:44,162
...and you in her life.

453
00:26:02,066 --> 00:26:03,200
Minute, please.

454
00:26:07,605 --> 00:26:10,397
I'm sorry. That was unnecessary.

455
00:26:15,447 --> 00:26:17,195
I'm sorry this is how it ended.

456
00:26:18,216 --> 00:26:19,823
We're not done yet.

457
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:22,152
She'll destroy you.

458
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,121
Only if you let her.

459
00:26:24,155 --> 00:26:26,757
You think I control Salen,
because we're dating?

460
00:26:26,791 --> 00:26:28,623
That's insane and a little sexist.

461
00:26:29,828 --> 00:26:31,495
Forget control.

462
00:26:31,563 --> 00:26:32,963
How about taking a stand?

463
00:26:32,997 --> 00:26:34,264
That's what I've been doing

464
00:26:34,299 --> 00:26:35,999
and will continue to do from the inside.

465
00:26:36,067 --> 00:26:38,268
You could've worked with me
to make things right.

466
00:26:38,303 --> 00:26:39,968
Instead, you had to
burn the building down.

467
00:26:40,505 --> 00:26:41,972
She lit the match.

468
00:26:42,252 --> 00:26:43,519
You know that.

469
00:26:49,147 --> 00:26:51,682
I feel a little sick.

470
00:26:51,749 --> 00:26:54,017
Could this be 'cause of
the, um, autoimmune thing?

471
00:26:54,085 --> 00:26:55,900
That's unlikely.

472
00:26:57,789 --> 00:27:01,024
Oh. Your eyes are jaundiced.

473
00:27:01,092 --> 00:27:04,451
Which means it is your liver.

474
00:27:05,763 --> 00:27:08,365
I will need you to do a full-body PET,
CT scan.

475
00:27:08,433 --> 00:27:09,533
Okay.

476
00:27:09,601 --> 00:27:11,535
And you, as well.

477
00:27:19,878 --> 00:27:22,285
Okay, Nira, we're all done.

478
00:27:23,248 --> 00:27:25,416
I'm glad I had you
come in for a check-up.

479
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:27,518
Your vision's actually improved a bit.

480
00:27:27,552 --> 00:27:30,877
You have 53%
of your left peripheral field.

481
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,837
That's great.

482
00:27:35,427 --> 00:27:38,552
How are you, uh, doing these days?

483
00:27:39,697 --> 00:27:42,722
I can't drive. I lose things.

484
00:27:43,768 --> 00:27:46,101
I had to go part-time at the company.

485
00:27:46,938 --> 00:27:49,521
It completely changed my life.

486
00:27:50,742 --> 00:27:52,476
I'm so sorry.

487
00:27:52,544 --> 00:27:56,111
No, the thing is, it needed changing.

488
00:27:57,248 --> 00:27:59,583
I was working seven days a week.

489
00:27:59,617 --> 00:28:02,993
My partner and I were about to separate.

490
00:28:04,622 --> 00:28:06,824
I was watching my son grow up

491
00:28:06,891 --> 00:28:09,749
through videos sent to me at the office.

492
00:28:11,329 --> 00:28:12,629
Now...

493
00:28:14,265 --> 00:28:16,047
I walk my kid to school.

494
00:28:16,935 --> 00:28:20,437
My relationship is in a great place.

495
00:28:20,472 --> 00:28:22,679
I'm happier than I've been in years.

496
00:28:24,843 --> 00:28:27,511
It reminded me what was important.

497
00:28:33,084 --> 00:28:36,943
You have liver cancer.

498
00:28:37,355 --> 00:28:40,591
Your symptoms were from
a paraneoplastic syndrome.

499
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:42,759
The tumor put your
immune system in overdrive.

500
00:28:42,794 --> 00:28:44,951
It started attacking unrelated organs.

501
00:28:47,932 --> 00:28:50,498
D-Did I give him cancer?

502
00:28:50,969 --> 00:28:55,205
Yes. There was probably a microscopic
lesion in the lobe you donated.

503
00:28:55,273 --> 00:28:58,006
But it was to your benefit.

504
00:28:58,343 --> 00:29:00,008
Your scans are clean.

505
00:29:01,813 --> 00:29:03,480
So what's next?

506
00:29:03,515 --> 00:29:04,763
Surgery?

507
00:29:06,618 --> 00:29:08,318
It's metastasized.

508
00:29:08,353 --> 00:29:10,120
We can resect the largest tumor

509
00:29:10,154 --> 00:29:12,122
and chemo-embolize some others.

510
00:29:12,156 --> 00:29:15,392
That'll give you
a few additional months.

511
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,376
Months?

512
00:29:23,401 --> 00:29:25,035
I'm sorry.

513
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:45,822
Salen's gonna fire you and
then come after you publicly.

514
00:29:45,857 --> 00:29:47,524
I don't care.

515
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:49,026
Well, you should care, Shaun.

516
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,594
Think about what she's gonna use.

517
00:29:50,662 --> 00:29:52,829
Your outbursts in the hospital,
your low scores,

518
00:29:52,864 --> 00:29:54,831
the complaint the nurse
made against you...

519
00:29:54,866 --> 00:29:56,500
I am a good surgeon.

520
00:29:56,534 --> 00:29:58,068
I don't believe I'll never work again.

521
00:29:58,102 --> 00:30:00,704
You're an excellent surgeon,
Shaun. That's the point.

522
00:30:00,738 --> 00:30:02,005
You can't risk that.

523
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,674
But you can?

524
00:30:03,708 --> 00:30:05,008
Lea can? Dr. Lim can?

525
00:30:05,043 --> 00:30:06,610
Yes, yes, yes.

526
00:30:06,678 --> 00:30:09,119
We can. You're exceptional.

527
00:30:11,049 --> 00:30:13,850
What you've accomplished is remarkable.

528
00:30:13,885 --> 00:30:15,750
We can't risk that.

529
00:30:22,961 --> 00:30:24,628
This is my decision.

530
00:30:24,696 --> 00:30:26,553
I'm an adult, Dr. Glassman.

531
00:30:30,702 --> 00:30:33,309
What are you gonna do
if you're not a surgeon?

532
00:30:36,307 --> 00:30:38,189
That's always been
what's most important.

533
00:30:41,579 --> 00:30:45,655
It's not what's most important to me.

534
00:30:46,484 --> 00:30:47,784
Not anymore.

535
00:30:51,155 --> 00:30:54,257
If I lose you from the hospital,

536
00:30:54,292 --> 00:30:57,959
if I lose Dr. Lim and Dr. Park and Lea,

537
00:30:59,831 --> 00:31:01,671
I don't want to work there anymore.

538
00:31:11,676 --> 00:31:13,016
Okay.

539
00:31:16,514 --> 00:31:19,116
Let's write that speech
to the Pension Fund.

540
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:20,751
I will do that alone.

541
00:31:20,785 --> 00:31:23,020
Your speech at my
engagement party was terrible.

542
00:31:31,516 --> 00:31:33,451
Cutting loop.

543
00:31:34,185 --> 00:31:36,329
Debulking
further tumor from the bladder wall.

544
00:31:37,021 --> 00:31:39,723
I see the deeper tumor fragment.

545
00:31:39,757 --> 00:31:41,391
We've got significant bleeding.

546
00:31:41,425 --> 00:31:43,760
Increasing irrigation.

547
00:31:45,129 --> 00:31:47,397
BP's dropping, and baby's
in fetal distress, too.

548
00:31:47,431 --> 00:31:49,099
Try bipolar cautery
on the tumor surface.

549
00:31:54,305 --> 00:31:56,072
It's not working.

550
00:31:56,107 --> 00:31:58,726
If we can't control this,
we're going to lose them both.

551
00:32:01,078 --> 00:32:02,612
Got to open her up.

552
00:32:05,483 --> 00:32:06,716
Heart and lungs sound good.

553
00:32:06,751 --> 00:32:08,402
We're cleared for surgery.

554
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:10,530
Do you have any questions?

555
00:32:11,455 --> 00:32:14,450
If it gives me a couple
more months, I'm all in.

556
00:32:16,127 --> 00:32:18,995
Dom, this'll go great.

557
00:32:19,063 --> 00:32:21,831
And then Alexa and
the baby arrive tomorrow.

558
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:24,801
We're gonna have an awesome
few days before I head back home.

559
00:32:27,672 --> 00:32:29,340
Wait, I'm...

560
00:32:31,576 --> 00:32:33,010
I'm so sorry, Ry.

561
00:32:35,346 --> 00:32:37,849
You stood up for me
when I was being bullied.

562
00:32:38,783 --> 00:32:41,352
You took me in when my marriage failed.

563
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:49,193
I tried to save you one time...

564
00:32:52,029 --> 00:32:53,364
...and I killed you.

565
00:32:57,928 --> 00:32:59,203
Dom...

566
00:33:03,174 --> 00:33:05,293
You gave me eight more months.

567
00:33:08,846 --> 00:33:11,716
I got to see the leaves turn
in Central Park.

568
00:33:14,571 --> 00:33:16,762
I got to watch my wife give birth.

569
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:23,686
And I got to hold my baby girl.

570
00:33:26,397 --> 00:33:29,150
Who you're gonna be
the world's best godfather to.

571
00:33:32,703 --> 00:33:34,004
Or I'll come back and haunt you.

572
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:45,458
I promise I will.

573
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:57,394
Mom's mean arterial pressure's 50.

574
00:33:57,428 --> 00:33:58,862
The tumor's stuck to the uterus.

575
00:33:58,896 --> 00:34:01,031
We need to do an emergency hysterectomy.

576
00:34:01,065 --> 00:34:02,499
There's still time.

577
00:34:02,533 --> 00:34:04,934
She's going to bleed out.
We have to take her uterus.

578
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:14,577
S-Subserosal fibroids are adherent, too.

579
00:34:14,612 --> 00:34:16,279
What if we treat the tumor like that?

580
00:34:16,347 --> 00:34:18,081
Get deep to the tumor plane,

581
00:34:18,115 --> 00:34:19,825
stop the bleeding at its source.

582
00:34:21,185 --> 00:34:22,585
Good for mom, not for baby.

583
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,020
We could close the uterine wall

584
00:34:24,055 --> 00:34:25,188
with three layered 3-0 sutures.

585
00:34:25,222 --> 00:34:26,256
That could keep the baby safe.

586
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,560
Yeah.

587
00:34:30,594 --> 00:34:31,895
Good thinking, both of you.

588
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:34,130
Let's get it done. Myomectomy scissors.

589
00:34:50,448 --> 00:34:54,117
I'm gonna go public
about Nira's treatment

590
00:34:54,151 --> 00:34:56,570
and the role Salen played in it.

591
00:34:57,421 --> 00:34:58,755
It should make a big impression

592
00:34:58,789 --> 00:35:00,533
on the Pension Fund's directors.

593
00:35:03,994 --> 00:35:06,956
That could have real
repercussions for your career.

594
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,501
I have to make this right.

595
00:35:12,503 --> 00:35:14,088
I'm not sure you can.

596
00:35:17,007 --> 00:35:19,051
But it's a step in the right direction.

597
00:35:33,357 --> 00:35:36,626
Speakers list for the Pension
Fund's annual meeting.

598
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:39,662
Glassman, Lim, that's hardly a surprise.

599
00:35:39,697 --> 00:35:42,616
Murphy? Wolke? Park and Reznick.

600
00:35:47,138 --> 00:35:48,664
Surgery go okay?

601
00:35:51,375 --> 00:35:54,086
Those doctors speaking out
at the Pension Meeting,

602
00:35:54,979 --> 00:35:56,946
I think they're right.

603
00:35:56,981 --> 00:35:58,448
We should go meet with them right now.

604
00:35:58,482 --> 00:35:59,983
I'm not hiring them back.

605
00:36:00,017 --> 00:36:01,351
At least hear them out,

606
00:36:01,385 --> 00:36:02,952
their concerns, their suggestions.

607
00:36:02,987 --> 00:36:04,721
Let's come up with some compromises,

608
00:36:04,789 --> 00:36:06,623
get them to agree
to not be at the meeting.

609
00:36:06,657 --> 00:36:08,224
Marcus, you're being incredibly naive.

610
00:36:08,292 --> 00:36:09,626
You may lose.

611
00:36:10,661 --> 00:36:12,021
It's possible.

612
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:15,498
You'll lose more than this hospital.

613
00:36:22,206 --> 00:36:24,240
I need to go get ready for tonight.

614
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:52,126
Your beard matches your eye bags.

615
00:37:19,953 --> 00:37:21,155
I'm sorry.

616
00:37:22,456 --> 00:37:23,589
What is this?

617
00:37:23,624 --> 00:37:25,358
Oppo research.

618
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:30,096
Oh, Marcus...

619
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:31,964
What do you think you have here?

620
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:35,535
I wrote off a trip to Cabo,
had an affair with a state senator...

621
00:37:35,602 --> 00:37:37,170
Oppo research on me.

622
00:37:40,808 --> 00:37:43,677
I've made mistakes, personally,
professionally. They're all there.

623
00:37:46,213 --> 00:37:47,647
If you're gonna
go through with this deal,

624
00:37:47,681 --> 00:37:49,715
you're gonna have to destroy me.

625
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,355
Walk away.

626
00:37:57,524 --> 00:38:00,986
You have every reason
to not want this deal.

627
00:38:04,498 --> 00:38:06,999
The Board will not fight you.

628
00:38:26,587 --> 00:38:27,930
I'm sorry.

629
00:38:30,457 --> 00:38:31,991
Me too.

630
00:38:44,838 --> 00:38:46,005
Well...

631
00:38:47,087 --> 00:38:48,288
Good luck.

632
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:51,444
'Cause now this is all your problem.

633
00:39:28,942 --> 00:39:31,118
I'm gonna sleep at my place tonight.

634
00:39:33,653 --> 00:39:34,886
Okay.

635
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:53,439
You sent this to Nira?

636
00:39:53,473 --> 00:39:54,473
Mm-hmm.

637
00:39:56,956 --> 00:39:59,188
This is an admission of misconduct.

638
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,147
Well, you know me.

639
00:40:01,181 --> 00:40:02,983
Go big or go home.

640
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:12,701
I hope you didn't do all this for me.

641
00:40:15,262 --> 00:40:16,329
No.

642
00:40:18,151 --> 00:40:21,877
I did this because of
who I am when I'm with you.

9999
