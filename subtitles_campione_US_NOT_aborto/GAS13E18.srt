1
00:00:01,207 --> 00:00:03,340
When my mother's Alzheimer's got bad,

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,261
I was going through her bills,

3
00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:07,230
and I found a notepad.

4
00:00:07,264 --> 00:00:09,565
Written on it were the words

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,257
"Important... tell Meredith not to..."

6
00:00:14,371 --> 00:00:15,571
And that was it.

7
00:00:15,606 --> 00:00:17,941
She never finished that sentence.

8
00:00:25,115 --> 00:00:27,283
Tell Meredith not to what?

9
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:28,952
Not to drink too much?

10
00:00:28,986 --> 00:00:31,241
Not to pet strange dogs?

11
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,946
Not to give her heart away?

12
00:00:35,826 --> 00:00:37,927
Not to leave the sprinklers on?

13
00:01:31,582 --> 00:01:34,550
We didn't exactly talk a lot
in those days.

14
00:01:34,585 --> 00:01:39,589
I regret that. I wish we had.

15
00:01:39,623 --> 00:01:41,169
I thought you said you and Dr. Cohen

16
00:01:41,204 --> 00:01:43,159
- had clean margins in the mastectomy.
- Yeah, we did.

17
00:01:43,193 --> 00:01:45,528
But then, a spot showed up
on the latest scans

18
00:01:45,562 --> 00:01:46,863
alongside the chest wall here.

19
00:01:46,897 --> 00:01:48,731
- So you didn't.
- It could be nothing.

20
00:01:48,766 --> 00:01:50,333
Or it could be leftover cells

21
00:01:50,367 --> 00:01:51,434
that weren't taken out and kept growing.

22
00:01:51,468 --> 00:01:53,366
- Maggie!
- I'm sorry. I...

23
00:01:54,304 --> 00:01:55,571
Keep going.

24
00:01:55,606 --> 00:01:57,707
We don't know what it is, really,

25
00:01:57,741 --> 00:01:59,019
until we get in there.

26
00:01:59,053 --> 00:02:00,610
Yeah, I'll do a wide local excision,

27
00:02:00,644 --> 00:02:02,712
explore the area,
remove anything I find.

28
00:02:02,746 --> 00:02:05,563
We may need to do a muscle flap
just to cover the defect,

29
00:02:05,597 --> 00:02:06,555
but simple.

30
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,469
Tomorrow.

31
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:08,529
No, we're thinking next week.

32
00:02:08,563 --> 00:02:09,719
No, it has to be tomorrow,

33
00:02:09,753 --> 00:02:11,085
The next day at the latest.

34
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,388
We should let her get stronger first.

35
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:13,556
She is strong.

36
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,110
And we don't want it to spread
past what it already has.

37
00:02:16,144 --> 00:02:17,727
Of course we don't,
but it's a big surgery, so...

38
00:02:17,761 --> 00:02:20,029
Yeah, I can handle it.

39
00:02:20,652 --> 00:02:21,697
I'm fine.

40
00:02:21,732 --> 00:02:25,435
I want the next surgery
as soon as you can do it.

41
00:03:01,872 --> 00:03:03,606
How'd it go?

42
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,674
Oh. Thank you.

43
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:08,578
Okay, I think.

44
00:03:08,612 --> 00:03:10,313
Her radiation caused some fibrosis,

45
00:03:10,347 --> 00:03:12,615
which made things a little tricky.

46
00:03:12,649 --> 00:03:14,784
I would've preferred to have
waited another week.

47
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:16,452
I wanted to wait two.

48
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:18,121
Hmm.

49
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:25,526
I'm sorry. I haven't followed up
on the... the thing.

50
00:03:26,196 --> 00:03:27,611
Dinner?

51
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:29,799
It's not because I don't want to.

52
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,801
It's just that I...

53
00:03:31,835 --> 00:03:33,788
Sure, I mean, you know, if...

54
00:03:34,805 --> 00:03:36,136
There's a lot going on.

55
00:03:36,171 --> 00:03:38,071
There is a lot going on.

56
00:03:39,143 --> 00:03:44,180
It'll happen... sometime.

57
00:03:44,214 --> 00:03:45,988
Sometime.

58
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,185
I better get in there.

59
00:04:04,034 --> 00:04:06,202
- Boo.
- Oh! God.

60
00:04:07,905 --> 00:04:08,971
You can't sleep?

61
00:04:09,006 --> 00:04:11,874
Wide awake, all hours.

62
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:14,710
This chair's the only place
my stomach and back

63
00:04:14,745 --> 00:04:16,974
can get comfortable, so...

64
00:04:18,348 --> 00:04:20,183
What are you doing up?

65
00:04:20,217 --> 00:04:22,652
I have three kids. I don't sleep.

66
00:04:22,686 --> 00:04:24,554
Motherhood.

67
00:04:28,392 --> 00:04:31,133
I always wanted more kids

68
00:04:32,207 --> 00:04:35,831
so Maggie could have
a sister or a brother.

69
00:04:38,902 --> 00:04:41,671
I was worried when she wanted
to move out here.

70
00:04:41,705 --> 00:04:43,239
She was happy in Boston,

71
00:04:43,273 --> 00:04:48,578
but... I'm really glad she found you.

72
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,558
You said your stomach is bothering you?

73
00:05:08,432 --> 00:05:09,677
Damn it.

74
00:05:11,435 --> 00:05:13,169
Richard?

75
00:05:17,641 --> 00:05:19,542
What are you gonna say?

76
00:05:23,413 --> 00:05:24,413
You're sure it's a met?

77
00:05:24,448 --> 00:05:26,882
It's right where the bile
drains from your liver,

78
00:05:26,917 --> 00:05:28,951
so that would explain your pain.

79
00:05:28,986 --> 00:05:30,720
You're saying I have another tumor?

80
00:05:30,754 --> 00:05:33,256
No. No, she's saying that cells
from the original tumor

81
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,658
have traveled
and grown in another place.

82
00:05:35,692 --> 00:05:36,959
In my liver?

83
00:05:36,994 --> 00:05:38,060
- Yes.
- Maybe.

84
00:05:39,329 --> 00:05:41,497
So, I know this is a lot to take in.

85
00:05:42,933 --> 00:05:46,402
So why don't the two of you,
um, take the night,

86
00:05:46,436 --> 00:05:47,770
and we can meet again in the morning

87
00:05:47,804 --> 00:05:48,938
and discuss it further, okay?

88
00:05:48,972 --> 00:05:50,519
We're here now.

89
00:05:51,308 --> 00:05:52,404
But I just meant that...

90
00:05:52,438 --> 00:05:53,843
Can you remove it laparoscopically?

91
00:05:53,877 --> 00:05:55,244
- What?
- Well, that would be better

92
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:57,446
than an open procedure
at this point, right?

93
00:05:57,481 --> 00:05:59,949
Then we wouldn't have to stop
her chemo regimen,

94
00:05:59,983 --> 00:06:01,917
unless you have
a different surgical plan.

95
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:04,754
Would you like to discuss this outside?

96
00:06:04,788 --> 00:06:06,922
No, no. We're discussing
my mother's treatment.

97
00:06:06,957 --> 00:06:09,825
- We can discuss it with her.
- Okay.

98
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,028
Diane, typically
with aggressive cancers,

99
00:06:12,062 --> 00:06:14,163
we only operate where
the original tumor began...

100
00:06:14,197 --> 00:06:15,792
in this case, it was your breast.

101
00:06:15,826 --> 00:06:18,834
Unless the cancer spreads beyond
that, surgery is not curative.

102
00:06:18,869 --> 00:06:22,338
But it could prevent further
pain and complications,

103
00:06:22,372 --> 00:06:24,106
which there will be
if the met keeps growing

104
00:06:24,141 --> 00:06:25,594
or spreads even further.

105
00:06:25,628 --> 00:06:27,943
And we would work to prevent
that using other options.

106
00:06:27,978 --> 00:06:29,545
Sure, pump her with more chemo.

107
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:30,892
Well, a second ago, you were worried

108
00:06:30,926 --> 00:06:31,947
about stopping her chemo.

109
00:06:31,981 --> 00:06:33,027
Just take out the met!

110
00:06:33,061 --> 00:06:34,350
You're asking me to perform
a procedure...

111
00:06:34,384 --> 00:06:35,651
You can barely see it on the scan.

112
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,053
...that will not only cause her pain,

113
00:06:37,087 --> 00:06:38,554
but put her at risk

114
00:06:38,588 --> 00:06:39,911
- It's my mother!
- for many complications.

115
00:06:39,945 --> 00:06:41,891
I'm asking you to think beyond
the standard and typical.

116
00:06:41,925 --> 00:06:44,560
And I'm asking you to listen
to yourself as a surgeon,

117
00:06:44,594 --> 00:06:46,395
- who should know better...
- Oh, good God, enough!

118
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,864
Both of you...
I can't even hear myself think.

119
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:49,999
Mama, we just... we need one...

120
00:06:50,033 --> 00:06:52,001
Are you saying

121
00:06:52,035 --> 00:06:53,869
that you can't do the surgery

122
00:06:53,904 --> 00:06:56,072
- to remove the, um...
- The met.

123
00:06:56,106 --> 00:06:57,340
Can you do it?

124
00:06:57,374 --> 00:06:59,675
I can, but I'm saying that I won't

125
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,410
because, in my professional opinion,

126
00:07:01,445 --> 00:07:02,978
I think it's a terrible idea.

127
00:07:03,013 --> 00:07:06,048
Meredith, if you won't do
the surgery, you should go.

128
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,017
We'll find another surgeon who will.

129
00:07:08,051 --> 00:07:09,852
- No, it's not...
- No.

130
00:07:09,886 --> 00:07:12,488
Maggie, this is not
your decision to make.

131
00:07:19,062 --> 00:07:21,162
Meredith, dear...

132
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,899
I'm firing you.

133
00:07:23,934 --> 00:07:26,068
You're no longer one of my doctors.

Synced & corrected by -robtor-

135
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,444
Thank you for meeting with me
this morning.

136
00:07:41,478 --> 00:07:46,103
I found something that...
it is called the BXP protocol,

137
00:07:46,138 --> 00:07:47,550
and it started at Gillman.

138
00:07:48,059 --> 00:07:51,195
They are experimenting
with humanized antibodies

139
00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:53,597
for late-stage cancer immunotherapy.

140
00:07:53,632 --> 00:07:55,599
A clinical trial.

141
00:07:55,634 --> 00:07:56,567
And it's successful?

142
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,003
The trial's next phase
was rushed into approval

143
00:07:59,037 --> 00:08:00,170
due to favorable outcomes.

144
00:08:00,205 --> 00:08:01,939
And your mom meets the criteria?

145
00:08:01,973 --> 00:08:04,341
Once we remove that met that's
obstructing her bile duct,

146
00:08:04,376 --> 00:08:06,710
her liver enzymes will go down,
and she's in.

147
00:08:06,745 --> 00:08:10,014
Um, Meredith doesn't feel
that surgery is wise.

148
00:08:10,048 --> 00:08:12,149
Meredith is no longer on the case.

149
00:08:12,183 --> 00:08:13,784
And now that I know about this trial,

150
00:08:13,818 --> 00:08:15,552
there is even more reason
to do the surgery.

151
00:08:15,587 --> 00:08:17,855
And I'd like one of you to do it.

152
00:08:19,758 --> 00:08:21,358
Oh.

153
00:08:21,393 --> 00:08:23,227
Um...

154
00:08:23,261 --> 00:08:25,062
You know, um,

155
00:08:25,096 --> 00:08:27,231
I think we should read up
on the trial...

156
00:08:27,265 --> 00:08:28,032
Mm-hmm.

157
00:08:28,066 --> 00:08:29,800
...and then come up with a plan.

158
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:30,868
Yeah.

159
00:08:30,902 --> 00:08:31,902
Does that sound good to you?

160
00:08:31,937 --> 00:08:34,305
Yeah. Yeah, thanks.

161
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:40,911
Does anyone think this is a good idea?

162
00:08:40,946 --> 00:08:42,146
- No.
- Not at all.

163
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,048
All right, so we're together on that.

164
00:08:44,082 --> 00:08:46,216
So, I'll bring up, uh, Diane's chart.

165
00:08:46,251 --> 00:08:48,419
We'll pull together some other
research and get together,

166
00:08:48,453 --> 00:08:49,711
see what we can come up with, huh?

167
00:08:49,745 --> 00:08:51,889
You know what? I'd prefer to work alone.

168
00:08:53,525 --> 00:08:54,925
Me, too.

169
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,227
No, no, no, no, guys,
that's not a good idea.

170
00:08:58,797 --> 00:09:01,231
Great.

171
00:09:01,266 --> 00:09:03,334
A biliary bypass wouldn't work,

172
00:09:03,368 --> 00:09:05,903
given the location and size of the met.

173
00:09:05,937 --> 00:09:08,439
Are you actually going to resect it?

174
00:09:08,473 --> 00:09:11,241
The met? I'm not going near that thing.

175
00:09:11,276 --> 00:09:12,142
No one would.

176
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:13,737
Right now, I'm just trying to figure out

177
00:09:13,772 --> 00:09:17,748
how to lower her LFTs
to get her into this trial.

178
00:09:20,051 --> 00:09:21,151
Did you consider stenting her?

179
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:24,855
Mm, that's still surgery.
I mean, with her condition...

180
00:09:24,889 --> 00:09:27,191
But if it's done percutaneously,
under minimal sedation...

181
00:09:27,225 --> 00:09:29,526
Yeah, it could give her
long-term relief,

182
00:09:29,561 --> 00:09:31,762
hopefully avoiding re-intervention.

183
00:09:31,796 --> 00:09:33,530
And get her LFTs down.

184
00:09:33,565 --> 00:09:34,890
I like it.

185
00:09:36,134 --> 00:09:38,202
Well, it's better
than a complete bypass.

186
00:09:38,236 --> 00:09:39,571
That's true.

187
00:09:40,805 --> 00:09:43,207
Okay, good.

188
00:09:43,241 --> 00:09:44,708
I was never here.

189
00:10:00,191 --> 00:10:02,326
How are her LFTs post-op? Any change?

190
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,794
Well, the procedure worked.

191
00:10:03,828 --> 00:10:06,263
I relieved the obstruction 100%.

192
00:10:06,297 --> 00:10:09,133
- And her LFTs are trending down, yes.
- Mm-hmm.

193
00:10:09,167 --> 00:10:11,101
So she'll qualify for the trial.

194
00:10:11,603 --> 00:10:14,271
Yes, she qualifies for the trial.

195
00:10:14,305 --> 00:10:16,306
Really?!

196
00:10:16,341 --> 00:10:18,942
Oh, my God. That is amazing news!

197
00:10:18,977 --> 00:10:22,613
Ah! Thank you, Dr. Bailey,
for doing the procedure!

198
00:10:22,647 --> 00:10:24,415
Oh! I gotta call my contacts at Gillman.

199
00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:27,117
I... I got to go. All right, thank you.

200
00:10:30,355 --> 00:10:32,122
- Damn it.
- Yep.

201
00:10:32,157 --> 00:10:34,491
No one wanted to mention
that we think that the trial

202
00:10:34,526 --> 00:10:36,060
is a completely terrible idea.

203
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,861
You need to sit her down and let
her know what's going on.

204
00:10:37,896 --> 00:10:39,730
- Me? I'm not doing that!
- You're her friend.

205
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,532
Who kept her mom's cancer
a secret from her.

206
00:10:41,566 --> 00:10:44,201
No, you're her dad. You do it.

207
00:10:44,235 --> 00:10:45,569
You're Diane's surgeon.

208
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,349
- So was Avery.
- Oh, come on.

209
00:10:47,383 --> 00:10:49,206
You led the procedure
that brought her LFTs down

210
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,304
and got her the trial
in the first place.

211
00:10:50,338 --> 00:10:52,042
A trial I never believed in.

212
00:10:52,077 --> 00:10:53,210
Yeah, well, you're the chief.

213
00:10:53,244 --> 00:10:54,389
Well, who's head of the board?

214
00:10:54,424 --> 00:10:56,213
- Now you care about that?
- Never mind.

215
00:10:56,247 --> 00:10:58,082
I'll do it.

216
00:11:07,258 --> 00:11:08,459
She's in the waiting room.

217
00:11:10,061 --> 00:11:11,681
Don't want to bother you.

218
00:11:12,163 --> 00:11:15,265
Oh, come in. Come in.

219
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,570
Oh. Maggie went to get me
some tea or something.

220
00:11:19,604 --> 00:11:21,238
Well, that's fine.

221
00:11:21,272 --> 00:11:24,108
You know, I wanted to chat...

222
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,310
Well?

223
00:11:26,344 --> 00:11:28,212
...about the clinical trial.

224
00:11:28,246 --> 00:11:29,793
Did I get in?

225
00:11:30,448 --> 00:11:33,484
Well, yes, y-y-you will, but, listen.

226
00:11:33,518 --> 00:11:37,154
- There are some things that...
- Maggie will be so excited.

227
00:11:37,188 --> 00:11:39,756
She... She wants to start right away...

228
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,925
the, um, the thingy.

229
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,327
The protocol.

230
00:11:43,361 --> 00:11:45,095
- Protocol.
- Mm-hmm.

231
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:47,297
Will you be doing the protocol?

232
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:50,501
I want to make sure you have
the complete picture.

233
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,471
The trial is very aggressive.

234
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:56,273
That's what we want, right?

235
00:11:56,307 --> 00:11:59,476
Yes, but, um...

236
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:01,824
the toll it's gonna take on your body...

237
00:12:02,714 --> 00:12:04,114
it will be difficult.

238
00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:05,906
Extremely difficult.

239
00:12:06,384 --> 00:12:07,775
I know.

240
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,623
But Maggie says it's a good idea.

241
00:12:12,657 --> 00:12:17,094
Diane, there's a reason
we don't let doctors

242
00:12:17,128 --> 00:12:19,240
treat members of their own family.

243
00:12:19,964 --> 00:12:22,766
Sometimes, the need
to help someone you love

244
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,263
can... cloud your judgment.

245
00:12:27,472 --> 00:12:31,241
She wouldn't do anything
to make me worse.

246
00:12:32,844 --> 00:12:34,144
She's my daughter.

247
00:12:34,179 --> 00:12:36,280
Here we go. Hi!

248
00:12:36,314 --> 00:12:37,514
Oh. Hi.

249
00:12:38,816 --> 00:12:39,850
What's the matter? What's wrong?

250
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,485
Oh, nothing.

251
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,954
Everything's great, sweetie.

252
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,391
Uh, you know what?

253
00:12:47,425 --> 00:12:48,825
I'm gonna let you get some rest,

254
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,361
and, um, we'll talk tomorrow.

255
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,197
I appreciate that.

256
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:54,398
See you then.

257
00:12:54,432 --> 00:12:55,866
Okay.

258
00:13:11,135 --> 00:13:13,115
- Yeah.
- Here you go, Ms. Pierce.

259
00:13:13,215 --> 00:13:15,616
Oh, wha... no need
for special treatment.

260
00:13:15,651 --> 00:13:18,319
I... I'm happy in the other chemo room,

261
00:13:18,353 --> 00:13:19,120
in the regular one.

262
00:13:19,154 --> 00:13:20,855
Right, Mom, it's a clinical trial

263
00:13:20,889 --> 00:13:22,623
so, um, they have to be able

264
00:13:22,658 --> 00:13:24,725
to control everything
in your environment...

265
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,662
the room temperature,
your temperature... everything.

266
00:13:27,696 --> 00:13:28,896
Oh.

267
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:30,865
I was going to ask Aurora

268
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:33,734
if Lee finally passed his driver's test.

269
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:36,504
- Who?
- Aurora, my chemo nurse.

270
00:13:36,538 --> 00:13:38,572
Her son Lee has failed it twice,

271
00:13:38,607 --> 00:13:41,475
and he was supposed to go
to the DMV today.

272
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,310
Oh.

273
00:13:42,344 --> 00:13:44,679
Maggie, you work with these people.

274
00:13:44,713 --> 00:13:46,280
How do you not know this?

275
00:13:47,302 --> 00:13:48,369
Um.

276
00:13:49,918 --> 00:13:51,385
How we doing in here?

277
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,888
Oh, been making a fuss.

278
00:13:53,922 --> 00:13:58,559
Um, we will need you to sign these forms.

279
00:13:58,593 --> 00:13:59,994
All of these?

280
00:14:00,028 --> 00:14:03,097
Yeah, well,
the thing with clinical trials

281
00:14:03,131 --> 00:14:08,002
is they can list a million ways
your body might react,

282
00:14:08,036 --> 00:14:11,005
but the truth is they just don't know.

283
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:12,661
That's why it's a trial.

284
00:14:13,575 --> 00:14:17,812
You need to be prepared for anything.

285
00:14:19,881 --> 00:14:21,248
Y... Here.

286
00:14:21,283 --> 00:14:22,950
Let me... Let me walk you through this.

287
00:14:22,984 --> 00:14:24,257
Um. Yeah.

288
00:14:25,287 --> 00:14:29,590
Um, so... so, what this says

289
00:14:29,624 --> 00:14:33,461
is you may experience
some nausea and vomiting.

290
00:14:33,495 --> 00:14:38,337
There's dehydration,
weakness, dizziness.

291
00:14:38,372 --> 00:14:40,234
There's fatigue...

292
00:14:45,741 --> 00:14:50,243
...night sweats, and chills...

293
00:14:53,949 --> 00:14:56,813
...skin irritation...

294
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,533
wound infections...

295
00:15:02,657 --> 00:15:04,492
...extreme fluid

296
00:15:04,526 --> 00:15:06,994
buildup.

297
00:15:09,965 --> 00:15:13,134
In short, it will get bad...

298
00:15:13,168 --> 00:15:15,169
...then really bad.

299
00:15:16,471 --> 00:15:19,173
And then, if it starts to work,

300
00:15:19,207 --> 00:15:24,111
hopefully you'll start
to get a little better.

301
00:15:26,014 --> 00:15:28,749
This treatment is killing her
faster than the cancer.

302
00:15:28,784 --> 00:15:29,917
That's what Diane wants.

303
00:15:29,951 --> 00:15:31,656
You mean what Maggie wants.

304
00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:52,840
Mom?

305
00:15:52,874 --> 00:15:54,275
Why aren't you resting?

306
00:15:54,309 --> 00:15:57,812
Oh, I woke up hours ago feeling great.

307
00:15:57,846 --> 00:15:59,213
I'll get that for you.

308
00:15:59,247 --> 00:16:01,982
So, I watched the news,
did a little laundry.

309
00:16:02,017 --> 00:16:04,652
Then I noticed that the pantry
was a little cluttered,

310
00:16:04,686 --> 00:16:06,287
so I reorganized it.

311
00:16:06,321 --> 00:16:07,688
Mom, you don't have to do that!

312
00:16:07,722 --> 00:16:08,856
Well, I did.

313
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:11,725
And you got up at the perfect time.

314
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,127
It's lasagna time.

315
00:16:13,161 --> 00:16:14,361
Lasagna?

316
00:16:14,396 --> 00:16:16,730
You're going to make my lasagna.

317
00:16:16,765 --> 00:16:17,598
Oh, no, Mom.

318
00:16:17,632 --> 00:16:19,533
I-I don't... I... That's your thing.

319
00:16:19,568 --> 00:16:21,068
I don't know how to make it.

320
00:16:21,102 --> 00:16:23,270
Well, you need to learn.

321
00:16:25,607 --> 00:16:27,308
No. Stop it.

322
00:16:27,342 --> 00:16:28,876
I don't want you passing things down.

323
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,196
That's not...

324
00:16:30,846 --> 00:16:32,313
I-I don't like that.

325
00:16:32,347 --> 00:16:33,547
Oh, that's not why.

326
00:16:33,582 --> 00:16:37,084
It's just that I have decided
I don't have to do this anymore.

327
00:16:37,118 --> 00:16:39,551
I am a woman of a certain age,

328
00:16:39,585 --> 00:16:43,810
and I have earned the right
to sit down, put my feet up,

329
00:16:43,844 --> 00:16:46,155
and let you cook for me.

330
00:16:46,428 --> 00:16:47,595
Mom.

331
00:16:47,629 --> 00:16:49,897
And you're not gonna like it
when I'm gone

332
00:16:49,931 --> 00:16:52,466
and you're missing my lasagna.

333
00:16:53,768 --> 00:16:55,669
Invite your friends.

334
00:16:55,704 --> 00:16:57,004
It'll be fun.

335
00:16:57,038 --> 00:17:00,441
Okay, I just need to go, um,
take a shower.

336
00:17:00,475 --> 00:17:02,576
Unh-unh, I don't think so.

337
00:17:02,611 --> 00:17:04,378
Grab that flour.

338
00:17:04,412 --> 00:17:05,817
We're doing this now?

339
00:17:05,851 --> 00:17:07,014
Okay.

340
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,350
It's awesome.

341
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,359
Hi! Why are you all here at once?

342
00:17:18,393 --> 00:17:19,393
- Hi!
- Uh, we... we carpooled.

343
00:17:19,427 --> 00:17:20,528
We thought it'd be fun.

344
00:17:20,562 --> 00:17:21,462
Yeah, Webber drove us.

345
00:17:21,496 --> 00:17:22,396
And we have wine. You guys,

346
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,632
she made me make
the noodles from scratch.

347
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,567
You know you can buy noodles
in a box, right?

348
00:17:27,969 --> 00:17:30,271
Wait, hold on. You were 2?

349
00:17:30,305 --> 00:17:31,639
2 years old.

350
00:17:31,673 --> 00:17:35,142
And when I say she was reading,
it was reading.

351
00:17:35,176 --> 00:17:37,878
Maggie was not sounding out
words or anything.

352
00:17:37,913 --> 00:17:39,113
Okay, Mom.

353
00:17:39,147 --> 00:17:39,813
And you didn't teach her?

354
00:17:39,848 --> 00:17:41,715
Oh, nobody could teach her.

355
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,084
My baby was a genius.

356
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:45,435
That brain of hers...

357
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:48,088
Okay. That's... Thanks, Mom.

358
00:17:48,123 --> 00:17:50,157
I have you to thank for that, I guess.

359
00:17:50,191 --> 00:17:52,593
Well I don't know about that.

360
00:17:52,627 --> 00:17:54,390
Oh, and your mother.

361
00:17:54,963 --> 00:17:58,399
I'd like to pay my respects to Ellis.

362
00:17:58,433 --> 00:18:00,568
I'm here, I'm staying in her house,

363
00:18:00,602 --> 00:18:02,970
and it's the right thing to do.

364
00:18:03,004 --> 00:18:05,272
That's very nice,
but you don't need to do that.

365
00:18:05,307 --> 00:18:07,141
Oh, but I want to.

366
00:18:07,175 --> 00:18:08,909
Where is she buried?

367
00:18:16,184 --> 00:18:18,452
Um...

368
00:18:18,486 --> 00:18:20,008
- A place where she loved...
- We dumped her ashes

369
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:21,021
down a scrub sink in OR 2.

370
00:18:21,056 --> 00:18:23,023
...by the water.

371
00:18:28,697 --> 00:18:30,097
Oh, my God!

372
00:18:30,131 --> 00:18:31,865
Well, it was her favorite OR,

373
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,969
and it seemed like
the right thing at the time.

374
00:18:37,238 --> 00:18:39,119
We're terrible people.

375
00:18:50,719 --> 00:18:52,286
I love it!

376
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,755
I love it!

377
00:19:03,231 --> 00:19:04,698
There you go.

378
00:19:06,101 --> 00:19:07,668
Oh, no.

379
00:19:10,205 --> 00:19:12,239
That's okay. That's okay.

380
00:19:12,273 --> 00:19:14,041
It's okay. It's okay.

381
00:19:14,075 --> 00:19:16,243
It's okay, Mom.

382
00:19:21,783 --> 00:19:23,183
Okay.

383
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:19,717
- I just heard... an esophageal tear?
- Yeah.

384
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:21,286
Hopefully, it's contained

385
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,521
and I don't have to open her chest.

386
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,163
What are you doing?

387
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:35,366
I should do the EGD. You're too close.

388
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,202
Go take care of Maggie.

389
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,390
Let me do this for you.

390
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:42,340
Don't pretend you're doing this for me.

391
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,242
You've made it very clear for some time

392
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:46,377
that my well-being is
the lowest of your priorities.

393
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:48,713
Do... Hey, I'm just trying to help.

394
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:51,962
If I needed help...

395
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:54,552
you'd be the last person I'd call.

396
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:03,561
You had to do a thoracotomy?

397
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,363
Yeah. The tear was full thickness.

398
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:08,233
Conservative management wasn't
the way to go here, Maggie.

399
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,902
No, you're right. Thank you.

400
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,771
So, we'll start her on tube feeds?

401
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:16,274
Um, we're... we're...
we're not there yet.

402
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,443
Uh. She's on TPN for now,

403
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:20,345
and I'm also concerned about sepsis,

404
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:23,414
so we've started her
on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

405
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,450
She's still sedated for the pain,

406
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:27,418
and we'll keep her on PCA.

407
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,306
Hey, keep her comfortable.

408
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:31,789
Do you need anything from home?

409
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:33,691
Do you want us to get you anything?

410
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:35,360
We need to get her on her feet ASAP.

411
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,195
If she misses any of her infusions,

412
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:38,631
she'll lose her position in the study.

413
00:21:38,665 --> 00:21:40,398
- Maggie...
- I'd like for us to get Diane

414
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,367
through the next 24 hours, okay?

415
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,469
And then, we'll... we'll see
where we are from there.

416
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:02,420
Maggie.

417
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:05,223
I really don't need you

418
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:07,425
trying to talk me
out of anything right now.

419
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:12,497
This protocol is making Diane so sick

420
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:14,065
that her esophagus tore.

421
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:16,000
That could just be from the cancer.

422
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:18,436
But you can't wait to get her
to her next infusion.

423
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,738
Because my mom wants to live!

424
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:23,074
And this clinical trial
could give that to her.

425
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:24,442
She wanted to do it.

426
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,153
- She could've said "no."
- How?

427
00:22:26,187 --> 00:22:27,612
How can she say "no" when her daughter,

428
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:30,014
who is a surgeon,
is standing right there,

429
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:30,882
pushing it on her?

430
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:33,117
There have been favorable outcomes!

431
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,021
I just need to get her
to the end of the treatment.

432
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,591
She won't make it
to the end of the treatment.

433
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:41,526
She's already dying, and now
she's suffering because of it.

434
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,461
At least I'm doing something.

435
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:46,297
At least I'm not just giving up
and saying "no."

436
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,035
We are only doing her harm.

437
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:54,038
You don't get it! You wouldn't!

438
00:22:54,073 --> 00:22:56,607
Meredith, I love my mother enough

439
00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:58,109
not to say, "Screw it,"

440
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:00,445
and throw her down a damn drain.

441
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:10,555
What do you need?

442
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:12,357
What can I do?

443
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:30,041
Where's Maggie?

444
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,465
Diane...

445
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:35,881
you don't have to keep
putting yourself through this.

446
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,770
Not if you don't want to.

447
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:44,188
I was born in a two-room shack
with an outhouse,

448
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:46,090
six brothers,

449
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:51,450
not a lot of food or love
or... anything.

450
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:55,689
Getting out of there was...

451
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:03,608
When that social worker
put this little baby in my arms,

452
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:07,825
when I looked down at my Maggie...

453
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:15,514
Maggie is the universe giving me a gift.

454
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:20,858
She is... a happy person.

455
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:23,706
She's cheerful.

456
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,431
Maggie is rare.

457
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,722
She's special.

458
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:30,970
This...

459
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:35,250
This will give her darkness.

460
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:38,776
How could I do that

461
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:43,080
to the most special person
in the whole world?

462
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:50,655
When I die, she needs to know

463
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:54,725
that she did everything that she could.

464
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,129
Diane, she has.

465
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:01,129
Maggie's done everything there is to do.

466
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:06,771
I can't stop. I-I can't do that to her.

467
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:08,005
Well, she can take it.

468
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,274
You may not see it, because you knew her

469
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:12,009
since she was a little girl.

470
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:13,499
I mean, I didn't.

471
00:25:13,533 --> 00:25:16,477
I only know the woman you raised.

472
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:22,920
And that woman is smart
and strong as iron,

473
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:25,599
especially for the people she loves.

474
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:31,142
Now well,

475
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:34,271
now I see where she gets it.

476
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:40,037
I don't want to die.

477
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:01,692
Hey.

478
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:03,294
So, I'm gonna put out a couple of calls

479
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:05,196
to some old professors from Boston.

480
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,731
Do you remember Dr. Luckett?

481
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:08,633
He specializes in radioactive...

482
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:09,700
Maggie...

483
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,141
Don't you dare quit on me now.

484
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:19,810
Y-You can't. You can't quit on me.

485
00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:21,479
We can beat this.

486
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:24,740
You have to fight. I'll help you.

487
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:28,553
Sweetie...

488
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:31,051
Sit down and let me talk to you.

489
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:53,110
Get those to the lab for me. Thank you.

490
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:09,360
You all right?

491
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:10,444
No.

492
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:17,301
Do you want to sit down?

493
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:18,739
No.

494
00:27:20,706 --> 00:27:23,404
I just wish my dad was here.

495
00:27:54,106 --> 00:27:55,773
Maggie?

496
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,813
Meredith doesn't get it.

497
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:04,482
She's just worried about you.

498
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,777
I just got started.

499
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:12,757
My mom has been sick for months
without me knowing...

500
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:14,091
months.

501
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:16,327
I feel like I left the house
with the oven on

502
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,995
and went about my business...

503
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,349
...and came back to find

504
00:28:19,374 --> 00:28:21,532
the whole house engulfed in flames.

505
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:24,420
And no one will let me in.

506
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:28,039
- No matter
what I do, I can't get inside.

507
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:30,512
I can't save anything.

508
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:35,144
I could've stopped it if I had known.

509
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:39,016
S-So, I can't give up.
I can't give up, not now.

510
00:28:42,435 --> 00:28:44,822
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

511
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:46,057
What?

512
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:47,653
Come here.

513
00:28:55,534 --> 00:28:59,370
Thank you. Mnh.

514
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:03,841
Thank you.

515
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:25,138
She's gonna go...

516
00:29:26,298 --> 00:29:27,665
and I'm not ready.

517
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,483
I'm not ready.

518
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,010
You're never ready.

519
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:40,459
You just do it.

520
00:29:41,619 --> 00:29:44,554
Listen to her.

521
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:46,550
Talk about whatever
she wants to talk about

522
00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:48,953
and record her voice in your mind

523
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:50,287
and memorize everything.

524
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,125
And just keep sitting there.

525
00:30:04,876 --> 00:30:09,089
♪ My own true love

526
00:30:29,576 --> 00:30:31,177
- Orgasms.
- No.

527
00:30:31,211 --> 00:30:32,878
It's not a dirty word.

528
00:30:32,913 --> 00:30:34,614
No, no!

529
00:30:35,882 --> 00:30:37,883
I'm dying.

530
00:30:37,918 --> 00:30:40,519
I have to impart wisdom.

531
00:30:40,554 --> 00:30:43,014
This wisdom, right now?

532
00:30:43,624 --> 00:30:44,457
You have got time.

533
00:30:44,491 --> 00:30:47,159
You don't have to go there right now.

534
00:30:47,194 --> 00:30:48,221
Mm.

535
00:30:49,363 --> 00:30:50,596
I've had orgasms.

536
00:30:50,631 --> 00:30:52,598
Oh, well, good.

537
00:30:52,633 --> 00:30:55,735
They're not a gift. It's your right.

538
00:30:55,769 --> 00:30:58,671
Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

539
00:30:58,705 --> 00:31:00,740
- And this is important.
- Mm-hmm.

540
00:31:00,774 --> 00:31:03,536
At least once a day.

541
00:31:04,111 --> 00:31:07,113
Sometimes, I like to wait until
right before bedtime, but...

542
00:31:07,147 --> 00:31:08,014
No, God!

543
00:31:08,048 --> 00:31:09,489
No, Mom! Stop.

544
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:13,131
You are too intense.

545
00:31:13,286 --> 00:31:15,087
Have some fun.

546
00:31:15,122 --> 00:31:16,589
I have plenty of fun.

547
00:31:16,623 --> 00:31:18,055
Which color?

548
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:20,006
The darker.

549
00:31:20,761 --> 00:31:23,596
Oh, did you call about my eyelashes?

550
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:26,132
You know I wanna die
with my eyelashes on.

551
00:31:26,166 --> 00:31:28,054
Eyelashes are tomorrow.

552
00:31:29,436 --> 00:31:31,804
Good.

553
00:31:31,838 --> 00:31:35,712
You were always so good.

554
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:38,286
What do you mean?

555
00:31:39,746 --> 00:31:44,617
Incredible grades, a clean room,

556
00:31:44,651 --> 00:31:46,742
ooh, you never talked back,

557
00:31:47,654 --> 00:31:51,791
and you never messed around
with the boys.

558
00:31:51,825 --> 00:31:53,893
Most parents would appreciate that.

559
00:31:53,927 --> 00:31:56,173
Oh, I did... then.

560
00:31:56,615 --> 00:31:58,041
But now...

561
00:31:59,253 --> 00:32:02,153
You need to shake it up a little.

562
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:04,724
Mm. Be a little lazy

563
00:32:04,758 --> 00:32:08,326
or a little slutty.

564
00:32:09,329 --> 00:32:11,264
Make a mistake.

565
00:32:11,298 --> 00:32:12,938
I have a job.

566
00:32:13,534 --> 00:32:15,568
Well, you're never gonna
look back and say,

567
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:17,403
"I wish I'd been more uptight."

568
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:19,438
Okay, Mom, you have to be still,

569
00:32:19,473 --> 00:32:20,473
or else I can't finish this.

570
00:32:20,507 --> 00:32:24,810
And stop always saying
what everyone wants to hear.

571
00:32:24,845 --> 00:32:26,512
Tell someone off.

572
00:32:27,781 --> 00:32:31,122
It's good for 'em and better for you.

573
00:32:31,685 --> 00:32:35,050
Especially if it's a car salesperson.

574
00:32:35,522 --> 00:32:37,690
- Do you like the color?
- I do.

575
00:32:37,724 --> 00:32:38,624
Okay.

576
00:32:38,659 --> 00:32:40,593
- And don't forget the t...
- The topcoat, I know.

577
00:32:43,897 --> 00:32:46,098
- Want some water?
- Mm.

578
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,445
Mnh.

579
00:32:57,144 --> 00:32:59,879
Mnh. Mnh.

580
00:32:59,913 --> 00:33:01,344
Mnh.

581
00:33:04,084 --> 00:33:05,518
Want me to keep going?

582
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:14,875
I brought my engagement ring to Seattle.

583
00:33:15,562 --> 00:33:19,031
It's at the house in my jewelry bag,

584
00:33:19,066 --> 00:33:21,567
and I want you to have it.

585
00:33:21,602 --> 00:33:24,637
- Mom.
- Your father gave it to me.

586
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:26,539
He'd want you to have it, too.

587
00:33:26,573 --> 00:33:28,322
So, please.

588
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:31,026
Okay.

589
00:33:31,778 --> 00:33:33,123
Thank you.

590
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:39,246
I want you to fall in love.

591
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,855
And it has to be somebody who's worthy.

592
00:33:42,889 --> 00:33:46,492
Find a decent man who loves you

593
00:33:46,526 --> 00:33:49,328
just a little more than you love him.

594
00:33:49,363 --> 00:33:51,597
How about equally as much?
How about that?

595
00:33:51,632 --> 00:33:55,434
No, he needs to think
he is lucky to have you

596
00:33:55,469 --> 00:33:57,003
and not the other way around.

597
00:33:57,037 --> 00:33:58,533
Other hand.

598
00:33:59,706 --> 00:34:03,638
Never make yourself small for anyone.

599
00:34:05,646 --> 00:34:07,522
Be your own person.

600
00:34:09,983 --> 00:34:12,351
And try wearing a little lipstick.

601
00:34:12,386 --> 00:34:14,020
You know, Mom, if you keep going
at this rate,

602
00:34:14,054 --> 00:34:16,531
you're gonna run out of advice
before tomorrow.

603
00:34:16,566 --> 00:34:21,527
Mm. Phew, this polish smells.

604
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:22,933
Want me to open a window?

605
00:34:22,968 --> 00:34:26,932
Oh. That would be nice.

606
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,808
It stopped raining.

607
00:34:37,844 --> 00:34:39,311
Okay, I'm not gonna leave it
open too long,

608
00:34:39,346 --> 00:34:41,013
or you'll catch a chill.

609
00:34:41,982 --> 00:34:43,816
Typical.

610
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:46,419
Bring you to a hospital,
help you catch a cold.

611
00:34:47,654 --> 00:34:49,092
Mom?

612
00:34:50,357 --> 00:34:51,971
Mom?

613
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:57,757
Mom?

614
00:34:59,266 --> 00:35:00,933
Mommy.

615
00:36:59,726 --> 00:37:01,893
Listen, I... I-I know the flight...

616
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:04,963
...the helicopter had to be expensive,

617
00:37:04,998 --> 00:37:08,166
and so I'll write you a check.

618
00:37:08,201 --> 00:37:11,470
Hey. No... No need. No.

619
00:37:11,504 --> 00:37:12,604
This is family.

620
00:37:14,355 --> 00:37:15,974
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

621
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:47,939
Thank you.

622
00:37:54,547 --> 00:37:55,947
Daddy?

623
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:58,183
Daddy.

624
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:32,060
Hey.

625
00:38:32,819 --> 00:38:34,286
- Hey.
- ♪ Here comes the spark

626
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,487
How's Pierce?

627
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:37,192
Not great.

628
00:38:38,257 --> 00:38:41,126
Yeah. I'm sorry to hear about Diane.

629
00:38:44,097 --> 00:38:46,631
She's gonna need me now.

630
00:38:46,666 --> 00:38:48,567
For how long, I don't know.

631
00:38:49,936 --> 00:38:51,169
I know.

632
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:01,646
Our timing's just... off, I guess.

633
00:39:01,681 --> 00:39:03,748
I think about my mom's note
all the time.

634
00:39:03,783 --> 00:39:06,251
Tell Meredith not to...

635
00:39:08,121 --> 00:39:10,021
Not to cave? Not to care?

636
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:12,591
Not to give up so easily?

637
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,327
Not to fall in love?

638
00:39:15,361 --> 00:39:17,978
Not to have children?

639
00:39:18,003 --> 00:39:19,498
Not to tell a lie?

640
00:39:23,697 --> 00:39:25,203
She left me wondering...

641
00:39:26,452 --> 00:39:30,308
...what to do, what not to do.

642
00:39:30,343 --> 00:39:31,843
Damn it.

643
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:46,324
What?

644
00:39:46,359 --> 00:39:49,394
She left me knowing
everything was up to me.

645
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:53,098
And me alone.

646
00:40:04,417 --> 00:40:06,488
Ellis never forgave me.

647
00:40:07,013 --> 00:40:10,032
She went to her grave
without forgiving me.

648
00:40:12,808 --> 00:40:15,548
It robbed me of so many things...

649
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:20,292
so many things.

650
00:40:24,925 --> 00:40:27,104
Let's not do that to each other.

651
00:40:30,848 --> 00:40:33,104
And she left me with no one to ask.

652
00:40:36,609 --> 00:40:39,578
So I would decide
what she meant to write.

653
00:40:42,913 --> 00:40:45,684
"Tell Meredith not to be afraid."

654
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,867
Goodbye, Mom.
