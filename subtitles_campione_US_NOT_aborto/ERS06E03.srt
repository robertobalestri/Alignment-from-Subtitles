1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,174
E.R.

2
00:00:05,175 --> 00:00:06,723
Previously on ER...

3
00:00:06,724 --> 00:00:09,020
What time are you off?

4
00:00:09,155 --> 00:00:10,120
Now.

5
00:00:10,121 --> 00:00:14,200
You should all offer Dr. Corday
your congratulations since most of you...

6
00:00:14,235 --> 00:00:17,408
will be working with her in her new position
as associate chief of surgery.

7
00:00:17,409 --> 00:00:18,609
What's all this about, Robert?

8
00:00:18,716 --> 00:00:21,307
No "Thank you I'm honored"?
No "I hope I don't dissapoint"?

9
00:00:21,308 --> 00:00:22,508
You still want to marry me?

10
00:00:22,809 --> 00:00:24,505
- Yes.
- Ok.

11
00:00:24,906 --> 00:00:26,747
So, she's looking at surgery?

12
00:00:26,748 --> 00:00:28,451
Has to have a mastectomy, I'm affraid.

13
00:00:28,786 --> 00:00:30,014
What about Reece, eh?

14
00:00:30,315 --> 00:00:32,851
You ever think of that? I mean
you want to take him away from his father?

15
00:00:32,852 --> 00:00:34,475
You may not even be his father.

16
00:00:34,776 --> 00:00:36,066
What?

17
00:00:36,186 --> 00:00:39,103
6x03 "GREENE WITH ENVY"

18
00:00:53,967 --> 00:00:56,174
Hi. I'm here to see Dr. Weaver.

19
00:00:56,387 --> 00:00:59,804
- She went that way handing out badges.
- Excuse me?

20
00:01:02,102 --> 00:01:06,647
"Creativity, accountability,
respect, excellence."

21
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:09,439
That's a lot to live up to.

22
00:01:09,654 --> 00:01:12,027
- He's looking for Dr. Weaver.
- This way.

23
00:01:12,199 --> 00:01:15,818
- Help me. I'm dying here...
- You'll be all right. Let's go. Sit here.

24
00:01:16,037 --> 00:01:19,441
- Lucy this guy has a little cut on his arm.
- A cut?! The bitch stabbed me!

25
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:20,665
What'd she stab you with, sir?

26
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:24,046
- Carving knife. Like I'm a
damn steak or something!

27
00:01:25,257 --> 00:01:26,669
There goes the ulnar!

28
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,913
You're killing me!

29
00:01:28,012 --> 00:01:31,798
Just breathe. I'm sorry.
Sit down, please.

30
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:34,804
Hold still. Don't be such a baby.

31
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,009
We can't help you unless you stop.

32
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:39,606
Look me in the eye. Hold still.

33
00:01:39,718 --> 00:01:42,470
- Are you a doctor?
- Keep the pressure on.

34
00:01:43,698 --> 00:01:45,276
We'll use this to make a tourniquet.

35
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,823
Get his arm out. Put your arm out.
Come on around this side.

36
00:01:50,498 --> 00:01:54,164
- Pump it up to 180.
- Keep breathing. Relax.

37
00:01:54,587 --> 00:01:58,538
- We got 180.
- All right, take your hand off.

38
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,508
Creativity. That's what's on your badge.

39
00:02:03,682 --> 00:02:04,713
Who are you?

40
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:07,384
Sorry I'm late. You all right?

41
00:02:07,562 --> 00:02:12,356
Get me some curved Kellys
and Vicryl, I'll be even better.

42
00:02:12,568 --> 00:02:13,897
Good to see you.

43
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:18,235
Lucy, this is Dr. Gabriel Lawrence,
our new Attending.

44
00:02:18,251 --> 00:02:19,896
How do you do?

45
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:14,728
- Mark.
- I know, I'm late.

46
00:03:14,899 --> 00:03:18,814
Meet Gabe Lawrence.
This is Dr. Mark Greene.

47
00:03:19,029 --> 00:03:21,817
Dr. Lawrence, it's a pleasure to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

48
00:03:21,991 --> 00:03:23,395
Don't hold it against me.

49
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,623
- Were you in an accident?
- No, I started my shift a little early.

50
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:30,688
- I'm sorry?
- Gabe's from New Western...

51
00:03:30,723 --> 00:03:33,955
- ... as our new Attending.
- As our new Attending.

52
00:03:35,175 --> 00:03:38,545
- We're incredibly lucky to have him.
- Absolutely.

53
00:03:38,763 --> 00:03:41,052
We're gonna take the grand tour.
Would you like to come with us?

54
00:03:41,266 --> 00:03:43,758
I've done the tour. I'm gonna get this.

55
00:03:43,978 --> 00:03:46,185
- What do you got, Doris?
- A 28-year-old fell off his bike.

56
00:03:46,398 --> 00:03:48,106
I didn't fall. A cab cut me off.

57
00:03:48,317 --> 00:03:49,362
Passed out for two minutes.

58
00:03:49,435 --> 00:03:52,108
Small contusions to his Forehead.
Vitals are stable.

59
00:03:52,322 --> 00:03:54,778
- Reece might not be yours?
- That's what she said.

60
00:03:54,992 --> 00:03:56,511
- You think she lying?
- I don't know.

61
00:03:56,524 --> 00:03:59,154
I wasn't with her 24 hours a day.

62
00:03:59,331 --> 00:04:01,538
Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man.

63
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:04,872
- She's gonna use this against me, isn't she?
- She can't.

64
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:08,171
If Carla had any doubts she should've
raised them at the petition...

65
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,835
to determine parentage three months ago.

66
00:04:09,853 --> 00:04:11,881
She didn't, so it's moot.
It's not a problem.

67
00:04:13,558 --> 00:04:16,394
You've put yourself through
a hell of a lot for this.

68
00:04:16,603 --> 00:04:18,072
Maybe we should make sure he's yours?

69
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:20,517
- Do a DNA test.
- No.

70
00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:24,774
Peter, you hired me to protect
your interests.

71
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:28,867
If you want a way out,
she gave you one.

72
00:04:38,548 --> 00:04:40,589
We'll have to intubate.

73
00:04:40,801 --> 00:04:44,467
Okay, on my count.
One, two, three. Good.

74
00:04:44,806 --> 00:04:47,429
- What do we got?
-16-year-old male.

75
00:04:47,643 --> 00:04:51,096
Single GSW to the left chest.
I'm gonna put him in a chest tube.

76
00:04:51,315 --> 00:04:52,644
Can you intubate?

77
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:53,890
I think I can manage.

78
00:04:54,068 --> 00:04:56,311
15 of Etomidate, 100 of sux,
number-eight ET tube.

79
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,567
- Help.
- You're gonna be okay. What's his name?

80
00:04:59,784 --> 00:05:02,276
Joshua Fox. That's his only I.D. he had.

81
00:05:02,496 --> 00:05:06,625
They'll put a tube down your throat
to help you breathe.

82
00:05:06,835 --> 00:05:09,409
- Can you call his family?
- Off a video card?

83
00:05:09,588 --> 00:05:12,045
It's all we've got. Thora-Seal's ready.

84
00:05:12,217 --> 00:05:13,248
Hook me up.

85
00:05:13,427 --> 00:05:16,097
What's this about a rescheduled surgery
this afternoon?

86
00:05:16,305 --> 00:05:18,595
Got a cancellation,
so I moved up a mastectomy.

87
00:05:18,809 --> 00:05:21,479
Oh, well, you can hold it back down.
I've got an elective hernia.

88
00:05:21,687 --> 00:05:24,218
I'm sorry. I'm not going to torture
a woman for another two weeks...

89
00:05:24,253 --> 00:05:26,331
just so some man can have his groin patched.

90
00:05:26,344 --> 00:05:27,642
Once again, male surgeons decide-

91
00:05:27,862 --> 00:05:31,314
Ok, I surrender. Hormones talking.
You can have your surgery.

92
00:05:31,633 --> 00:05:33,111
I'm in. Bag him.

93
00:05:33,327 --> 00:05:37,196
Well, It doesn't seem to be much blood in
here at all. I'll sew the tube in. An O silk.

94
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:39,824
Good breath. Call ICU.

95
00:05:40,044 --> 00:05:42,619
- See if we can get him a bed?
- Sure. Be right back.

96
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:47,135
So, Dr. Cordey, the mastectomy coming in
today, is it Elaine Nichols?

97
00:05:47,304 --> 00:05:50,389
- I thought that wasn't until-
- I moved it forward.

98
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,551
Sure that's the right thing to do?
Isn't it kind of fast?

99
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:57,857
- Why are you so interested?
- She's a friend of the family.

100
00:05:58,068 --> 00:06:01,153
Really? Then I shouldn't be
discussing it with you, should I?

101
00:06:01,364 --> 00:06:03,487
Make sure you get a chest film.

102
00:06:04,701 --> 00:06:07,769
Lucy, you finished assisting Dr. Carter.
Good. I have something for you.

103
00:06:07,781 --> 00:06:10,041
The Chicago Gazette is sending over
a reporter today.

104
00:06:10,116 --> 00:06:11,660
Mostly to do a puff piece on me.

105
00:06:11,877 --> 00:06:13,538
But they also want to take a look at the ER.

106
00:06:13,713 --> 00:06:14,944
Why are you telling me?

107
00:06:14,964 --> 00:06:17,717
Well, because you're going to show them
around let him see what heroes we all are.

108
00:06:17,885 --> 00:06:21,302
How we save kiddies' lives. Etcetera.
Blow my trumpet.

109
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:24,053
- You do that better yourself.
- Look at you. Look at me.

110
00:06:24,068 --> 00:06:27,519
- Who'd you rather spend and hour with?
- You have a point.

111
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,226
- Next time wear a helmet.
- Come on, doc, Give me a break.

112
00:06:31,444 --> 00:06:34,814
How about a fractured skull?
Want to be fed through a tube? Be my guest.

113
00:06:35,032 --> 00:06:37,987
Okay, I'll wear the helmet.
Can I go now?

114
00:06:38,203 --> 00:06:40,777
Not yet. We need a head CT.

115
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:43,972
What's that?

116
00:06:44,044 --> 00:06:45,871
My Core Values badge.

117
00:06:46,046 --> 00:06:49,001
Creativity, Accountability,
Respect, Excellence.

118
00:06:49,217 --> 00:06:52,717
All that and beautiful too.
You must be some kind of nurse.

119
00:06:52,888 --> 00:06:54,383
I am.

120
00:06:55,058 --> 00:06:59,104
- Why doesn't Dr. Grumpy have one?
- Guess I'm out of the loop.

121
00:06:59,313 --> 00:07:03,002
It looks like you've got a broken arm,
Loren. We're gonna need some x-rays.

122
00:07:03,037 --> 00:07:04,568
Any other sign of trauma?

123
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:09,738
Contusion to the right shoulder,
ecchymosis of the face and right hip...

124
00:07:10,244 --> 00:07:13,080
And slight wrist tenderness to the wrist.

125
00:07:13,874 --> 00:07:17,410
- How far did you fall, Loren?
- I'm not sure.

126
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:19,171
Can you tell me how you fell?

127
00:07:19,381 --> 00:07:23,000
Did you fall like this,
or did you fall more on your hand?

128
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:24,972
Yes.

129
00:07:25,263 --> 00:07:29,559
- What, on your hand?
- I don't remember. I'm sorry.

130
00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:32,641
Don't worry. Don't worry.
That's what we have x-rays for.

131
00:07:33,274 --> 00:07:35,800
So I'll get an AP,
and a lateral of the forearm,

132
00:07:35,977 --> 00:07:37,485
as well as wrist and elbow films.

133
00:07:37,696 --> 00:07:40,615
Sure, we don't want to miss anything.

134
00:07:41,868 --> 00:07:44,870
It's busy. I know, Patient through-time...

135
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,836
is longer than at New Western.
But our census is bigger.

136
00:07:47,871 --> 00:07:50,204
OH, busy is good. Busy keeps you young.

137
00:07:50,463 --> 00:07:52,486
I'll just take a look
at that fellow in Three.

138
00:07:52,499 --> 00:07:55,670
Look at that. How cute is that.
Thanks, guys.

139
00:07:55,886 --> 00:07:59,755
- What's in here, it's so heavy?
- Something to spice up your wedding night.

140
00:07:59,975 --> 00:08:02,431
Conni! You shouldn't have.
Spice up mi wedding night?

141
00:08:03,464 --> 00:08:05,647
Sure! Nice hot gumbo
to keep up his strength.

142
00:08:05,816 --> 00:08:07,608
Jenny, It's this your last shift for a while?

143
00:08:07,777 --> 00:08:10,103
Yep, catching a plane at 6:00 to New Orleans.

144
00:08:10,322 --> 00:08:12,362
Then in the morning, Reggie will make me
an honest woman...

145
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:13,612
and I'm going to show him the town.

146
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,736
Show him a wild time in New Orleans, honey!

147
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,914
I'm sure he'll be very happy.
Didn't I give you a Core Values badge?

148
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:22,542
- A toddler chewed it.
- There you go. Always wear it.

149
00:08:22,754 --> 00:08:23,554
I will.

150
00:08:23,571 --> 00:08:26,587
I guess you can take it off
on your wedding night.

151
00:08:27,944 --> 00:08:29,555
Now, open your eyes.

152
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,465
Relax. What three things
did I ask you to remember?

153
00:08:33,518 --> 00:08:37,387
- Dog, fire truck and Brigitte Bardot.
- Excellent.

154
00:08:37,607 --> 00:08:40,644
Dates me, I know, but your first love
is always your strongest.

155
00:08:40,661 --> 00:08:44,563
You must be Dr. Lawrence?
John Carter, Senior Resident.

156
00:08:44,783 --> 00:08:47,701
As usual, I'm learning how
to be a doctor from my patient.

157
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,872
Meet Mr. Ulman. Minor head trauma,
brief LOC.

158
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:55,627
You tell me what reflex would indicate
increased intracranial pressure.

159
00:08:57,049 --> 00:09:00,715
- A blown pupil?
- Not a reflex. Observe.

160
00:09:00,929 --> 00:09:02,672
I scratch the thenar eminence.

161
00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:06,722
I look for ipsilateral contractions
of the muscles of the chin muscles.

162
00:09:06,895 --> 00:09:08,126
I see none.

163
00:09:08,146 --> 00:09:11,214
Therefore I diagnose no significant
head injury.

164
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:12,943
It's called Radovici's sign.

165
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:15,442
You can dress, my friend.
I'll see about getting you discharged.

166
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:17,483
- Thanks a lot, Doc!
- My pleasure.

167
00:09:19,411 --> 00:09:21,404
Radovici's sign? Pretty cool.

168
00:09:21,664 --> 00:09:23,953
- Try it on your next head trauma.
- I will.

169
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,703
- Got that migraine in Four?
- Yeah, sure.

170
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:29,752
I'll tell you how I remember.
Radovici sounds like radish.

171
00:09:29,787 --> 00:09:31,425
I pluck the radish with my thumb...

172
00:09:33,429 --> 00:09:36,300
Daycare said he cried all day,
tugging on his ear.

173
00:09:36,474 --> 00:09:37,506
Temp's 101.

174
00:09:37,726 --> 00:09:41,226
Must be a load off having a daycare
center here.

175
00:09:41,397 --> 00:09:44,269
- Does his mom work too?
- Yeah.

176
00:09:44,652 --> 00:09:49,114
It must be tough on the both of you.
Such a sweet kid.

177
00:09:51,202 --> 00:09:54,572
- How's his ear?
- He's got a nasty looking otitis.

178
00:09:54,748 --> 00:09:56,326
- Is he allergic to any medication?
- No.

179
00:09:58,211 --> 00:10:03,123
Ok. Some Tylenol for the pain, and
let's put him on amoxicillin for 10 days.

180
00:10:03,209 --> 00:10:05,218
Did you have ear infections as a kid?

181
00:10:05,387 --> 00:10:06,718
No, why?

182
00:10:06,972 --> 00:10:08,716
Is just they often run in families.

183
00:10:09,934 --> 00:10:12,780
Yeah, well, you know,
he probably got it in daycare.

184
00:10:12,815 --> 00:10:14,644
I mean, there is a Lot of sick kids up there.

185
00:10:14,857 --> 00:10:18,477
You wanna leave him here with me
until his temperature goes down?

186
00:10:21,115 --> 00:10:22,396
Yeah, sure.

187
00:10:26,164 --> 00:10:28,916
I know. Come on, come on.

188
00:10:29,376 --> 00:10:31,932
All right. There you go.

189
00:10:40,616 --> 00:10:44,184
Has ICU found a bed
for Joshua Fox yet?

190
00:10:44,354 --> 00:10:48,139
The gunshot wound kid in Trauma One.
Well, call them again.

191
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:51,396
- Have you seen my bicycle guy?
- Isn't he still in courtain Three?

192
00:10:51,513 --> 00:10:54,953
Spandex-butt?
Yeah, he was discharged by GL.

193
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,113
- Who's GL?
- Gabriel Lawrence.

194
00:10:57,329 --> 00:10:59,203
All right, the good-looking older guy.

195
00:10:59,373 --> 00:11:02,957
I just saw him going
to the lounge with Dr. Corday.

196
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:06,001
A Frenchman, Dr. René Laënnec...

197
00:11:06,036 --> 00:11:10,341
rather than press his ear
to mademoiselle's magnificent breast...

198
00:11:10,512 --> 00:11:15,342
rolled-up a newspaper instead
and used that to listen to her heart.

199
00:11:15,561 --> 00:11:17,352
Voilà, the first stethoscope!

200
00:11:17,363 --> 00:11:21,016
Voilà, the first sensitive male doctor
in history!

201
00:11:21,235 --> 00:11:23,806
Dr. Green, you know
who invented the stethoscope?

202
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:28,070
I don't.
Did you discharge my patient?

203
00:11:28,244 --> 00:11:29,475
I don't believe so.

204
00:11:29,495 --> 00:11:31,951
Mr. Ulman. Fell off his bike.

205
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,991
I wasn't aware he's your patient.

206
00:11:35,211 --> 00:11:38,628
He was. I'd ordered a head CT
which he obviously didn't get.

207
00:11:39,091 --> 00:11:43,256
Don't worry. I performed a thorough
neurological exam. He didn't need a CT.

208
00:11:43,472 --> 00:11:44,847
The lost of consciousness...

209
00:11:45,015 --> 00:11:47,554
put him a risk factor
of intracranial hemorrhage.

210
00:11:48,144 --> 00:11:51,614
Minuscule risk. I gave him
a head-injury instructions sheet.

211
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:53,396
If he has any warning signs, he'll come back.

212
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:56,814
He lives alone. If he slips into a coma,
no one knows.

213
00:11:57,031 --> 00:11:58,190
This isn't like New Western.

214
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,449
County patients tend to be a little
less reliable when it comes to follow-up.

215
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:03,653
I'm aware of that, Dr. Green.

216
00:12:03,831 --> 00:12:07,332
That's why I told him to call me
in four hours to tell me how he's doing.

217
00:12:07,544 --> 00:12:10,582
Difficult if he's passed out
on the floor.

218
00:12:14,637 --> 00:12:16,179
What would you do?

219
00:12:17,223 --> 00:12:20,428
Without seeing the patient,
I'd rather-

220
00:12:20,645 --> 00:12:24,014
No, I'd like to know.
What would you do?

221
00:12:24,232 --> 00:12:27,484
Fell off his bike. Lost consciousness.

222
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:32,241
You did a complete neuro exam?

223
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:37,364
Yes, he was alert and oriented.
Full balance, recall, normal reflexes.

224
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:40,248
- How long was lost of consciousness?
- Less than two minutes.

225
00:12:40,712 --> 00:12:44,378
- You visualized the fundi?
- Discs were sharp.

226
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:48,595
I think Dr. Greene
was just being very thorough.

227
00:12:48,973 --> 00:12:50,930
Sounds like a "no" to me.

228
00:12:51,142 --> 00:12:54,429
Look at it this way.
We just saved Mr. Ulman $800.

229
00:12:55,147 --> 00:12:58,648
- "A" for Accountability.
- Right.

230
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,303
Yeah but she really
does meet all the requirements.

231
00:13:02,338 --> 00:13:03,862
I really couldn't agree
with you more on this-

232
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:06,739
- Can I talk to you?
- You'll get back to me later, right?

233
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:09,197
- As soon as I can.
- What's up?

234
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,704
What's up? Why you didn't tell me
you were hiring Lawrence?

235
00:13:11,778 --> 00:13:13,873
I only found out that he was available
two days ago.

236
00:13:14,047 --> 00:13:16,884
So, in two days you didn't have time
for a five-minute conversation?

237
00:13:16,902 --> 00:13:19,556
Mark, look, I mean, the man's a legend.

238
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:22,033
He's one of the founding fathers
of emergency medicine.

239
00:13:22,107 --> 00:13:24,099
We're so lucky to have him.

240
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:27,346
Couldn't you have the courtesy
to at least tell me first?

241
00:13:27,523 --> 00:13:29,048
It's called respect, Kerry.

242
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:32,057
Look, it's even on your stupid badge.

243
00:13:43,418 --> 00:13:45,126
Elaine.

244
00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:50,041
- Heard you were coming in today.
- Did you?

245
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,562
- I asked you to leave me alone.
- Yeah, I know.

246
00:13:54,722 --> 00:13:58,807
I know that you did and I'm sorry.
But I really need to talk to you.

247
00:13:59,021 --> 00:14:00,849
Because it's...

248
00:14:01,316 --> 00:14:04,484
Because I don't want you to have
the wrong idea about me.

249
00:14:04,695 --> 00:14:05,941
I don't.

250
00:14:06,364 --> 00:14:09,559
I want you to know that I'm here for you.
And that for me this wasn't just about-

251
00:14:09,594 --> 00:14:10,816
- Sex?
- Yeah.

252
00:14:10,995 --> 00:14:13,665
- It wasn't about that.
- It was for me.

253
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:20,000
If we're talking needs, John, I don't need
you to feel sorry or worried.

254
00:14:20,049 --> 00:14:23,750
Or tender or anything.
I just need you to go away.

255
00:14:25,222 --> 00:14:26,681
I don't wanna go away.

256
00:14:33,941 --> 00:14:37,643
Loren Johnson's X-ray. Mid-shaft fracture
of the radius.

257
00:14:37,863 --> 00:14:41,316
No injury to the wrist or elbow.
She was lucky.

258
00:14:41,535 --> 00:14:44,987
- Maybe not.
- What's this?

259
00:14:45,206 --> 00:14:49,052
Some more of Loren Johnson.
I pulled her records.

260
00:14:49,162 --> 00:14:52,132
See these calluses?
Healed rib fractures.

261
00:14:52,298 --> 00:14:56,677
And this, some kind of blunt trauma.

262
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,303
Maybe a baseball bat.

263
00:14:59,516 --> 00:15:02,304
She wants to go home as soon
as we splint her arm.

264
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,476
You know, this is only her second visit here.

265
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:10,103
But she has been to Mercy three times,
McGaw twice, Ravenswood once.

266
00:15:10,222 --> 00:15:12,860
This time, I don't want her
to go home.

267
00:15:16,338 --> 00:15:18,555
- Dr. Kovac?
- Yes?

268
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,365
Yes. Hi, I'm Loren's husband, Pauly.

269
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,753
I just want to thank you
for looking after her so well.

270
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,919
Loren wasn't clear on how
the accident exactly happened.

271
00:15:29,038 --> 00:15:33,884
Maybe that's because she's a little bit
embarrassed about it, isn't that right, Loren?

272
00:15:34,403 --> 00:15:35,818
How did it happen?

273
00:15:36,338 --> 00:15:40,566
She was up a ladder in our bedroom
hanging drapes and lost her footing.

274
00:15:40,778 --> 00:15:43,945
Asked her not to do it by herself,
didn't I, honey?

275
00:15:44,157 --> 00:15:45,586
Yes, you did.

276
00:15:50,332 --> 00:15:52,341
Shall I splint her?

277
00:15:54,671 --> 00:15:57,722
- Mark, can I have a word-?
- Lizzy, Paula Trancoso, Chicago Gazette.

278
00:15:57,792 --> 00:16:00,548
Elizabeth Corday,
My associate Head of Surgery.

279
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,242
And Mark Greene, one or our ER docs.

280
00:16:03,357 --> 00:16:04,620
You' re wearing scrubs.

281
00:16:04,692 --> 00:16:07,265
Yes, it was my idea. I wanted to blend in.

282
00:16:08,105 --> 00:16:10,743
Elizabeth was gonna show Paula
around the ER. You don't mind, Mark?

283
00:16:11,242 --> 00:16:14,397
If you feel Dr. Corday has the time...

284
00:16:14,513 --> 00:16:16,718
Had I known that the Gazette
was gonna send you, my dear,

285
00:16:16,753 --> 00:16:18,344
I would have made time in my schedule.

286
00:16:18,614 --> 00:16:22,619
But as it is, I'll have to leave you to
the tender mercies of Dr. Corday.

287
00:16:22,999 --> 00:16:27,045
Well, this is the ER, obviously.

288
00:16:30,042 --> 00:16:33,197
- This is Josh's cousin.
- Great.

289
00:16:33,312 --> 00:16:37,188
Josh. Josh, your cousin's here.

290
00:16:38,219 --> 00:16:39,534
How's he doing?

291
00:16:39,587 --> 00:16:40,846
He looks a lot worse than he is.

292
00:16:40,956 --> 00:16:43,076
His lung collapsed so we put a tube
in his chest.

293
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:44,772
You can talk to him if you want.

294
00:16:44,986 --> 00:16:48,356
- He's taching at 140.
- Josh, are you in pain?

295
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:50,982
- BP 180 over 120.
- Call Benton.

296
00:16:51,002 --> 00:16:55,331
- Maybe he's hemorrhaging. Let's spin the crit.
- His pulse is up to 160.

297
00:16:55,366 --> 00:16:58,583
You'll have to wait outside.
Wait outside, please.

298
00:16:58,732 --> 00:17:01,669
Go outside. Come on.

299
00:17:01,882 --> 00:17:04,718
What is it?
Does the chest tube hurt you?

300
00:17:04,828 --> 00:17:08,179
- What have we got?
- He's tachy at 160.

301
00:17:09,167 --> 00:17:11,806
- What's his crit?
- Drawing it.

302
00:17:12,571 --> 00:17:14,480
You having trouble breathing?

303
00:17:17,528 --> 00:17:19,853
You were shot. Yes, we know.

304
00:17:26,164 --> 00:17:28,371
My God! He's the shooter.

305
00:17:30,252 --> 00:17:32,044
I'll call Security.

306
00:17:44,604 --> 00:17:48,389
- Hey, hold it right there!
- He's got a gun!

307
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:52,071
Drop it!

308
00:17:57,454 --> 00:17:58,997
Get down!

309
00:18:35,587 --> 00:18:39,022
- We need a gurney over here.
- Looks like an abdominal wound.

310
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,970
- Get a backboard, over here!
- Strong carotid pulse.

311
00:18:42,137 --> 00:18:45,637
- His chest's clear. His name?
- McGinnis. Joe McGinnis.

312
00:18:45,808 --> 00:18:47,766
- Need help?
- We're fine.

313
00:18:47,978 --> 00:18:49,885
I want two lines NG and a Foley.

314
00:18:49,956 --> 00:18:52,894
Roll him gently. Gently.

315
00:18:53,818 --> 00:18:56,773
On my count. One, two, three, lift.

316
00:18:56,989 --> 00:18:59,725
CBC, coag, type and cross for four.
Call O.R.

317
00:18:59,835 --> 00:19:01,729
BP's 130 over 80. Pulse is 96.

318
00:19:02,304 --> 00:19:04,242
No visible GSWs to chest or abdomen.

319
00:19:04,257 --> 00:19:05,916
Let's roll him.

320
00:19:06,627 --> 00:19:08,187
See anything back there?
Any blood?

321
00:19:08,204 --> 00:19:10,996
- Nothing on the back.
- All right, check the extremities.

322
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:14,171
- Where's the blood from?
- Looks like he cut his hand.

323
00:19:14,206 --> 00:19:17,762
- Did he even get shot?
- No, he fainted.

324
00:19:21,696 --> 00:19:23,854
- Is this the guy who got shot? You need me?
- Yes, his hand needs suturing.

325
00:19:24,917 --> 00:19:27,456
Suturing? That's it?

326
00:19:27,471 --> 00:19:30,163
I want every piece of equipment
checked for damage.

327
00:19:30,183 --> 00:19:33,571
I don't want anybody seizing
because their IVs are punctured.

328
00:19:33,587 --> 00:19:36,315
- Nineteen patients all accounted for.
- Nobody's hurt?

329
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:40,184
Nothing serious, apart from the guard.
Two flesh wounds from ricochets.

330
00:19:40,219 --> 00:19:43,485
Some glass cuts and contusions
from diving to the floor. That's all.

331
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,715
That's all? There must've been
about 20 bullets flying around.

332
00:19:47,772 --> 00:19:49,716
Guess we got lucky.

333
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,852
MVA, SUV versus truck.
38-year-old male driver...

334
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:56,488
broke his nose when the airbag inflated.

335
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,257
- My wife and child were-
- They are just behind you.

336
00:19:58,292 --> 00:20:00,127
Wife has a few minor scrapes,
little boy is Ok.

337
00:20:00,162 --> 00:20:01,726
Why the cops? What's going on here?

338
00:20:01,761 --> 00:20:03,149
Curtain Three!

339
00:20:03,984 --> 00:20:05,793
- What do we got?
- Boy's named David. He's nine.

340
00:20:05,813 --> 00:20:09,933
Slightly tachy 110. BP's 115 over 83.
Chest pain.

341
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:12,040
One, two, three!

342
00:20:13,789 --> 00:20:17,406
Hi, David, I'm Cleo.
Do you know what happened to you?

343
00:20:17,418 --> 00:20:20,257
We were in an accident.
This truck just hit us.

344
00:20:20,372 --> 00:20:22,375
Son of a bitch came right through the red.

345
00:20:22,879 --> 00:20:25,384
Look, I know my nose is broken.
Why are you fiddling with my face for?

346
00:20:25,403 --> 00:20:28,275
Just checking to see if anything else
is broken, Mr. Bradley.

347
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,933
If David's okay,
we don't have to stay do we?

348
00:20:31,111 --> 00:20:34,327
Lungs clear bilaterally.
Still tachycardic.

349
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:37,393
We called our doctor from the ambulance.
He said they should take us to Ambrose.

350
00:20:37,461 --> 00:20:39,654
But the paramedics said you were closest.

351
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:43,622
They are allowed to do that, the paramedics.
Can they go against the patients' wishes?

352
00:20:43,794 --> 00:20:46,998
Get a crit, UA, C-spine
and chest film.

353
00:20:47,115 --> 00:20:51,344
Until I do these tests,
David's not going anywhere.

354
00:20:53,006 --> 00:20:54,884
Elaine?

355
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:58,763
- Is everything all right?
- Everything is fine.

356
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,701
I just think maybe this has been
too fast for me.

357
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:05,236
So, I wanna go home and think about it.

358
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:09,826
You know, I could use some fresh air myself.
Why don't we take a walk?

359
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:14,993
- Want to say goodbye to anybody else?
- I've been doing that all day.

360
00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:17,617
You didn't think you were
to sneak out on us, did you girl?

361
00:21:17,638 --> 00:21:20,135
Beautiful. How will I get it on the plane?

362
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,632
Leave Reggie behind
and put them on his seat.

363
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:24,198
- Thank you.
- Take care.

364
00:21:24,213 --> 00:21:26,473
- See you.
- Thanks.

365
00:21:26,566 --> 00:21:29,070
Jeany I need to see you in here
and you too, Reggie.

366
00:21:29,071 --> 00:21:30,400
- But my shift is over
- I know.

367
00:21:30,435 --> 00:21:32,939
- We have a plane to catch.
- I know. Come on.

368
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:38,810
Carlos!

369
00:21:39,483 --> 00:21:40,728
What's going on?

370
00:21:40,743 --> 00:21:44,328
Ask Adele. She really put herself
on the line for this.

371
00:21:44,339 --> 00:21:46,865
We're gonna let you take Carlos.

372
00:21:48,752 --> 00:21:50,128
Really?

373
00:21:50,497 --> 00:21:54,726
On a temporary basis. And once you get
yourself approved as a foster parent...

374
00:21:54,736 --> 00:21:59,217
...then we can consider something
more official and permanent.

375
00:21:59,725 --> 00:22:00,970
Thank you.

376
00:22:00,985 --> 00:22:02,217
You're welcome.

377
00:22:02,937 --> 00:22:05,643
I guess we're not going to New Orleans.

378
00:22:05,816 --> 00:22:07,940
We can still get married here in Chicago.

379
00:22:09,705 --> 00:22:12,396
We could try the courthouse.

380
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,403
When?

381
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:17,157
Today.

382
00:22:20,469 --> 00:22:23,620
- Dr. Lawrence.
- Dr. Greene. I've got her.

383
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:27,442
Next time, could you sign up
on the board?

384
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:34,501
Paperwork! You can run,
but you can't hide.

385
00:22:34,512 --> 00:22:39,226
- She's really hurting this time.
- You been sick with fever, Cristal?

386
00:22:39,577 --> 00:22:41,152
Vomiting a little?

387
00:22:41,704 --> 00:22:43,532
No. Just hurting.

388
00:22:43,632 --> 00:22:45,505
She's had a sickle crisis before?

389
00:22:45,577 --> 00:22:47,606
The same as last month.

390
00:22:48,446 --> 00:22:52,995
We're gonna get you something for the pain,
and then we're gonna run some tests.

391
00:22:53,303 --> 00:22:55,160
80 of Demerol, 40 of Phenergan,

392
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:58,466
CBC, chem panel and a UA, please.

393
00:23:00,353 --> 00:23:03,674
- Is that the sickle-cell girl?
- Yeah.

394
00:23:03,691 --> 00:23:06,762
Could you add a retic count
and a Beta HCG?

395
00:23:06,837 --> 00:23:08,479
You got it.

396
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:14,661
Can we go now, doctor, before another
gang band start sooting out the place?

397
00:23:14,772 --> 00:23:17,380
- I need to talk to you first.
- Sure, what about?

398
00:23:17,459 --> 00:23:21,444
It's just some forms to fill out.
Please.

399
00:23:23,533 --> 00:23:25,328
Something wrong?

400
00:23:28,431 --> 00:23:32,333
I have to inform you Mr. Johnshon
that I believe you're mentally ill.

401
00:23:32,553 --> 00:23:33,498
What?!

402
00:23:33,571 --> 00:23:38,220
- Because of your illness you can reasonably-
- You're the one who's ill!

403
00:23:40,806 --> 00:23:43,063
What the hell do you think-?

404
00:23:44,193 --> 00:23:47,777
Okay, I get it.
I'm in the nuthouse, huh?

405
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:56,743
"Due to your illness,
you can reasonably be expected...

406
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:00,835
to inflict serious physical harm
on yourself or on others.

407
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:03,289
Therefore you're subject
to involuntary admision...

408
00:24:03,369 --> 00:24:06,341
and are in need
of immediate hospitalization."

409
00:24:06,555 --> 00:24:09,723
Wait till my lawyer gets ahold of you.

410
00:24:15,108 --> 00:24:17,085
You have no criteria to hold him.

411
00:24:17,161 --> 00:24:18,292
Her x-rays are my criteria.

412
00:24:18,312 --> 00:24:21,051
If she won't press charges,
they mean nothing.

413
00:24:21,124 --> 00:24:24,361
He's gonna get up to Psych, and they'll
send him right back down and he'll go home.

414
00:24:24,378 --> 00:24:26,437
I don't care about him.
I care about her.

415
00:24:26,457 --> 00:24:30,492
We can do nothing or we can do something.
This way she has a chance.

416
00:24:35,634 --> 00:24:37,177
I can't really...

417
00:24:37,228 --> 00:24:38,888
run away.

418
00:24:39,231 --> 00:24:40,262
Can I?

419
00:24:40,341 --> 00:24:42,996
You can delay, but not for long.

420
00:24:44,004 --> 00:24:45,880
Elaine, if you are worried
about reconstruction,

421
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,041
I can make an appointment
with a plastic surgeon, and you can just-

422
00:24:49,077 --> 00:24:53,110
What will happen to it?
After you cut it off?

423
00:24:53,324 --> 00:24:57,952
- Now you're being morbid.
- Why? It's a part of me.

424
00:24:58,673 --> 00:25:02,622
It'll go to Pathology
and then it'll be got rid of.

425
00:25:03,637 --> 00:25:05,747
Thrown in the trash.

426
00:25:06,892 --> 00:25:08,966
Just medical waste.

427
00:25:09,812 --> 00:25:12,551
I'll have a blob of gel instead.

428
00:25:14,585 --> 00:25:17,936
What will it feel like
when I touch it?

429
00:25:18,648 --> 00:25:20,191
When somebody else touches it?

430
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:23,144
Elaine, lots of women
have this type of surgery.

431
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:25,178
I can't imagine feeling anything.

432
00:25:25,591 --> 00:25:28,993
And If I can't, how will anybody else?

433
00:25:29,296 --> 00:25:32,034
How can I be with anybody again?

434
00:25:32,249 --> 00:25:36,463
- You can't let this define you.
- It's hard not to.

435
00:25:36,538 --> 00:25:39,247
I was happy with who I was.

436
00:25:39,392 --> 00:25:42,463
That's exactly who you'll still be.

437
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,060
I'd better come back in.

438
00:25:51,607 --> 00:25:54,479
I may be vain, but I'm not stupid.

439
00:25:58,483 --> 00:26:01,669
- Can you do something for me?
- Of course.

440
00:26:01,838 --> 00:26:05,753
When you cut, you cut everything.

441
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:08,946
Don't leave anything. Cut it all.

442
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:14,530
You know the only good thing
about sickle cell gene?

443
00:26:14,646 --> 00:26:17,059
- There isn't anything good.
- No, no, there is.

444
00:26:17,094 --> 00:26:18,953
You know, there is a disease
called malaria...

445
00:26:19,073 --> 00:26:22,978
that kills almost a million children a year.

446
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:26,026
What do you think
protects people against malaria?

447
00:26:26,461 --> 00:26:29,965
The sickle-cell gene.
That isn't a bad thing, is it?

448
00:26:30,082 --> 00:26:32,359
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

449
00:26:32,861 --> 00:26:36,198
She should drink lots of liquids and bring
her right back if she has more pain.

450
00:26:36,233 --> 00:26:39,253
- Sure. Say thank you, Cristal.
- Thank you.

451
00:26:39,269 --> 00:26:41,959
You're welcome. You can get dressed
and go home now.

452
00:26:45,494 --> 00:26:47,967
Over here. Over here.

453
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:50,315
Thank you.

454
00:26:50,592 --> 00:26:53,301
- The labs come back yet?
- No, not yet.

455
00:26:53,336 --> 00:26:55,428
Let me know if they do.

456
00:26:55,807 --> 00:26:59,109
Dr. Kovac. Carl De Raad, Psychiatry.

457
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:01,851
Your psychiatric hold:
way out of line, my friend.

458
00:27:02,023 --> 00:27:02,898
Why?

459
00:27:02,933 --> 00:27:06,801
Because to justify certification a patient
has to be a danger to himself or others.

460
00:27:06,821 --> 00:27:09,696
He is a danger to others.
Come on, just look at his wife.

461
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:11,484
She said she fell off a ladder.

462
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:15,206
Until she says different, nothing we can do.
I'm sorry.

463
00:27:15,224 --> 00:27:17,151
- Have you talked to him?
- I've seen him.

464
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:21,873
Dr Kovac, I know why you did it. But I'm not
even gonna take him upstairs for evaluation.

465
00:27:21,908 --> 00:27:23,343
I'm going to release him.

466
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:27,179
Can you do me a favor?
Can you talk to him at least?

467
00:27:27,239 --> 00:27:29,713
- What's the point?
- Please.

468
00:27:30,452 --> 00:27:33,689
You and me, let's talk to him.

469
00:27:35,083 --> 00:27:36,694
The crazy foreigner.

470
00:27:36,777 --> 00:27:38,516
They should put these on you, you know?

471
00:27:38,592 --> 00:27:41,277
Why? I'm not going to hit your wife.

472
00:27:41,316 --> 00:27:43,864
I never hurt my wife. Never.

473
00:27:43,899 --> 00:27:45,846
Mr. Johnson, settle down.
We just want to talk to you.

474
00:27:45,855 --> 00:27:48,848
Well talk to her. Go ahead, ask her.
Have I ever hurt you?

475
00:27:48,934 --> 00:27:51,573
No! Will you let him go, please?

476
00:27:51,646 --> 00:27:53,697
- You want us to release him?
- Please.

477
00:27:53,698 --> 00:27:54,698
OK. Let him go.

478
00:27:54,749 --> 00:27:58,597
How long before you hit her again?
On the way home?

479
00:27:58,813 --> 00:28:03,144
Or maybe wait till you get drunk?
Have a bad day at work?

480
00:28:03,161 --> 00:28:05,897
- What are you doing?
- One thing I don't understand.

481
00:28:05,906 --> 00:28:10,560
The X-rays show your wife had
three cracked ribs. Here:

482
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:13,179
- How'd it happen?
- Leave it, Kovac.

483
00:28:13,199 --> 00:28:16,735
She fell off a ladder again? Or what?
Was it down the stairs, maybe-

484
00:28:16,812 --> 00:28:18,507
Can you shut this guy up?

485
00:28:18,622 --> 00:28:21,577
- Did you just kick her?
- That's enough.

486
00:28:21,651 --> 00:28:23,311
To break her ribs...

487
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:27,471
you'd have to stamp on her chest.
What a man!

488
00:28:27,492 --> 00:28:29,138
Shut up!

489
00:28:33,433 --> 00:28:35,144
Go on, then.

490
00:28:37,371 --> 00:28:38,900
Screw you.

491
00:28:40,484 --> 00:28:42,113
- I'll kill him!
- No!

492
00:28:42,428 --> 00:28:43,703
I'll kill him!

493
00:28:43,913 --> 00:28:46,483
- Calm down, Mr. Johnson!
- Get off of me! I'm gonna kill him!

494
00:28:47,484 --> 00:28:51,764
- See? Danger to others.
- Get out of here!

495
00:28:52,591 --> 00:28:53,920
See?

496
00:28:57,764 --> 00:28:59,015
All right.

497
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:02,335
Mark, Beta HCG on the sickler.

498
00:29:02,345 --> 00:29:05,133
- Where are they?
- They walked out a couple of minutes ago.

499
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:07,893
Lawrence, we got a problem here.

500
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:14,979
Mr. Powell?

501
00:29:17,507 --> 00:29:20,125
- We need you to come back into the hospital.
- But we just left.

502
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,991
Your daughter needs another test.

503
00:29:22,004 --> 00:29:23,762
But we've seen the doctor.
Cristal is feeling much better.

504
00:29:23,832 --> 00:29:25,959
- What is it?
- She needs to come back.

505
00:29:26,076 --> 00:29:28,632
- Excuse me?
- The ICON is positive.

506
00:29:31,316 --> 00:29:33,972
She has to come right back in. Now.

507
00:29:40,687 --> 00:29:43,176
Dr. Finch, Sam Jacobs.

508
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:47,114
I just want to thank you for looking after
one of my favorite families so very well.

509
00:29:47,128 --> 00:29:48,706
We haven't quite finished the tests.

510
00:29:48,722 --> 00:29:51,448
I've made arrangements for David
to be transfered to Ambrose.

511
00:29:51,467 --> 00:29:54,538
If you'd be so kind as to sign him.

512
00:29:55,873 --> 00:29:57,698
I'm not happy about moving him.

513
00:29:57,809 --> 00:30:01,079
I've looked it. His C-spine's clear.
An ambulance is waiting.

514
00:30:01,197 --> 00:30:04,515
He complained of back pain at the scene.
I'm still waiting on a second crit.

515
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:06,885
When you get that, fax it over to me.

516
00:30:07,062 --> 00:30:08,722
It'll be a half an hour, that's all.

517
00:30:08,739 --> 00:30:11,363
In half an hour, Dr. Finch, he'll be
under observation at Ambrose,

518
00:30:11,398 --> 00:30:13,616
not taking up precious space here.

519
00:30:13,629 --> 00:30:15,724
We ready to roll, Sam?

520
00:30:16,499 --> 00:30:18,128
Are we, Dr. Finch?

521
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:22,787
- There's the ovary.
- It looks pretty normal.

522
00:30:22,999 --> 00:30:27,047
- What are you looking for?
- There. Mass in the fallopian tube.

523
00:30:27,163 --> 00:30:29,933
- What is it?
- Fetal pole and heartbeat.

524
00:30:30,084 --> 00:30:33,002
- What did he say?
- There's a heartbeat.

525
00:30:33,213 --> 00:30:35,339
- What are you saying?
- There's a heartbeat.

526
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:38,959
- Your daughter's pregnant.
- No, she's 12 years old!

527
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:42,723
- There's got to be a mistake.
- There's no mistake. She's pregnant.

528
00:30:42,783 --> 00:30:46,365
The fetus is in the fallopian tube,
not the uterus.

529
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,021
- I want a second opinion.
- I'm the second opinion.

530
00:30:49,033 --> 00:30:50,840
We're lucky we caught this early enough.

531
00:30:50,875 --> 00:30:52,901
Your daughter needs surgery now.

532
00:30:52,963 --> 00:30:57,328
If it ruptures, it could be very
dangerous. I'm gonna call the O.R.

533
00:31:00,456 --> 00:31:05,716
- Were you checking up on me?
- Just watching out for the patients.

534
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,075
Will there be video games?

535
00:31:11,153 --> 00:31:14,270
Sure. Video games, TV, your own room.

536
00:31:14,441 --> 00:31:18,643
Just like a hotel.
What's your favorite game?

537
00:31:18,746 --> 00:31:20,324
David?

538
00:31:20,424 --> 00:31:24,243
David? David, can you hear me? Stop!

539
00:31:24,262 --> 00:31:26,087
What? Why are we stopping?

540
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:28,849
- He's tacky. Get a BP.
- I can't get a pressure.

541
00:31:28,926 --> 00:31:31,252
No pulse on the left. Go to trauma.

542
00:31:31,371 --> 00:31:33,748
- I don't want him staying here.
- He has to.

543
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:35,555
- Need a hand?
- Eight years old. Name is David,

544
00:31:35,633 --> 00:31:39,134
in rapid deceleration. MVA, crashed
while being transferred to Ambrose.

545
00:31:39,206 --> 00:31:42,642
Probable a traumatic rupture at the junction
of the subclavian and aortic arch.

546
00:31:42,761 --> 00:31:45,513
- Why was he being transfered?
- All right, we' re going to have to crack him.

547
00:31:45,581 --> 00:31:48,687
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Thoracotomy tray.

548
00:31:50,354 --> 00:31:52,381
Where is Kerry? She said she'd be here.

549
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:54,988
- You know this place closes at 5?
- Yeah, we know.

550
00:31:55,001 --> 00:31:58,821
- Do we really need two?
- Two witnesses, yes.

551
00:32:06,075 --> 00:32:09,376
Right, suction. Start a round with
the packed cells.

552
00:32:09,487 --> 00:32:12,176
- He's in V-tach.
-60 of lidocaine.

553
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:16,175
- Son of a bitch. I can't find the source.
- He's still in V-tach.

554
00:32:16,195 --> 00:32:19,415
Stand by with the paddles.
I've never done one like this before.

555
00:32:19,634 --> 00:32:24,029
- Why don't you talk me through it?
- Keep suctioning. You have to-

556
00:32:24,198 --> 00:32:26,461
Connie, would you get
that woman out of here!

557
00:32:26,996 --> 00:32:28,201
Ma'am, you have to leave.

558
00:32:28,236 --> 00:32:32,155
- Peter, need any help?
- Please, Mark, get that woman out of here.

559
00:32:32,374 --> 00:32:33,942
- Get your hands off me.
- Out!

560
00:32:33,977 --> 00:32:37,379
Gonna clamp distally to the left subclavian.

561
00:32:37,798 --> 00:32:41,250
Open the pleura to identify
the area that's leaking.

562
00:32:42,714 --> 00:32:45,492
Release the clamp distally
to identify the leak.

563
00:32:47,828 --> 00:32:50,350
- I see it.
- Now evacuate the hematoma.

564
00:32:50,899 --> 00:32:55,610
Put a curved Potts underneath the leak
to leave the aorta patent.

565
00:32:58,325 --> 00:33:00,534
Now clamp above the tear.

566
00:33:02,806 --> 00:33:05,746
There you go, Carter,
You just isolated the leak.

567
00:33:06,681 --> 00:33:08,353
Nice work, Carter.

568
00:33:12,093 --> 00:33:15,111
Do you Reginald Moore take this woman
to be your lawful wedded wife...

569
00:33:15,122 --> 00:33:17,511
to live together in the state
of matrimony...

570
00:33:17,683 --> 00:33:21,136
to love her, honor and keep her
through sickness and prosperity...

571
00:33:21,155 --> 00:33:23,413
whatever your future might be?

572
00:33:23,424 --> 00:33:25,319
I do.

573
00:33:26,211 --> 00:33:30,824
- I think he needs a feeding.
- Okay. Just one second.

574
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:37,952
Sorry. Hi. Are you hungry?

575
00:33:38,126 --> 00:33:39,621
It's okay. Go on.

576
00:33:39,703 --> 00:33:43,306
And do you Jeanie Boulay take this man
as your lawful wedded husband...

577
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:45,808
to live together
in the state of matrimony...

578
00:33:46,061 --> 00:33:49,224
to love, honor and keep him
through sickness and prosperity...

579
00:33:49,233 --> 00:33:50,975
whatever your future might be?

580
00:33:51,027 --> 00:33:52,896
I do!

581
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:58,927
No, it's not unusual.

582
00:33:58,962 --> 00:34:01,653
This is a teaching hospital
and Residents are here to learn.

583
00:34:01,673 --> 00:34:04,016
So they are allowed to practice on patients.

584
00:34:04,093 --> 00:34:05,569
How else do they learn?

585
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,919
A little tough on whoever
they learn on, isn't it?

586
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:10,048
The residents are carefully supervised.

587
00:34:10,101 --> 00:34:12,748
What I saw wasn't
carefully supervised.

588
00:34:13,313 --> 00:34:15,358
Well, I'm sure you've seen enough,
didn't you?.

589
00:34:15,433 --> 00:34:20,841
It was really really nice to meet you. And
I do look forward to reading your article.

590
00:34:21,265 --> 00:34:23,983
Mark, thank God I got rid of her.

591
00:34:24,052 --> 00:34:28,214
Yeah, careful she doesn't turn up
somewhere else disguised as a surgeon.

592
00:34:28,425 --> 00:34:30,951
- Did she get in the way in Trauma?
- Yeah.

593
00:34:31,028 --> 00:34:35,475
- Mark, I didn't ask to be her tour guide.
- Well, you didn't say no.

594
00:34:38,495 --> 00:34:41,573
- How's it going?
- Fine. Heard about your Psych hold.

595
00:34:42,626 --> 00:34:44,785
Yeah, I'm very popular with Psychiatry.

596
00:34:44,804 --> 00:34:48,670
They took him upstairs for assessment.
Maybe they'll hold him.

597
00:34:48,684 --> 00:34:52,752
I don't think so. I provoked him,
in front of witnesses.

598
00:34:52,872 --> 00:34:55,043
Maybe now she'll see how he's really like,
you know.

599
00:34:55,109 --> 00:34:56,889
You don't think she knows?

600
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:59,101
Yeah, I know, it's hopeless.

601
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:01,260
Maybe not. She didn't go upstairs with him.

602
00:35:01,282 --> 00:35:03,186
Lucy took her to the cafeteria.

603
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,731
Fingers crossed.

604
00:35:11,338 --> 00:35:13,946
David's stabilized. He's in surgery.

605
00:35:14,025 --> 00:35:16,451
Barring any complications, he'll be okay.

606
00:35:16,878 --> 00:35:18,456
If you want to go and see him
the nurse will take you.

607
00:35:18,723 --> 00:35:21,927
- Thank you.
- Thank you, doctor.

608
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:25,507
Dr. Finch.

609
00:35:27,934 --> 00:35:29,559
You did well to catch that.

610
00:35:29,812 --> 00:35:32,435
If we'd waited for the tests,
we'd would have seen this.

611
00:35:32,582 --> 00:35:34,145
We could've operated
in a controlled manner...

612
00:35:34,317 --> 00:35:36,690
...rather than having to rip an
8- year-old's chest open.

613
00:35:36,929 --> 00:35:39,302
- We had no choice.
- I did.

614
00:35:39,416 --> 00:35:42,072
I shouldn't have let myself
listen to you.

615
00:35:55,136 --> 00:35:58,553
- How are you feeling?
- Okay.

616
00:35:59,308 --> 00:36:03,141
It went well. There was no evidence
the cancer had spread.

617
00:36:03,355 --> 00:36:07,057
But we will have to wait for the pathology
reports on the lymph nodes.

618
00:36:07,302 --> 00:36:11,103
I got a plastic surgeon in to close,
so we could minimize scarring.

619
00:36:11,324 --> 00:36:15,109
And of course within the next couple
of weeks we can begin reconstruction.

620
00:36:16,205 --> 00:36:17,865
When can I go home?

621
00:36:18,541 --> 00:36:22,326
Well, we had to put in some drains
to collect any accumulating fluid.

622
00:36:22,671 --> 00:36:24,795
Like I'm a sewer system.

623
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,588
Most likely it'll just be for the night.

624
00:36:27,803 --> 00:36:30,211
So you'll be able
to go home tomorrow.

625
00:36:31,208 --> 00:36:34,144
Now, I've given the nurse
all my numbers.

626
00:36:34,312 --> 00:36:39,141
So if you need anything,
you have any questions, just call...

627
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,688
anytime.

628
00:36:42,889 --> 00:36:44,449
Thanks.

629
00:36:46,035 --> 00:36:49,239
Oh, Dr. Kovak, now
that Dr. Lawrence is here...

630
00:36:49,456 --> 00:36:52,873
I don't believe that we're gonna be
needing you anymore, ok?.

631
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:55,126
Okay.

632
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:59,960
- Hey, are you on tonight?
- No, I'm not.

633
00:37:12,235 --> 00:37:14,906
- How much fluid did you give him?
- Two liters wide open.

634
00:37:14,914 --> 00:37:17,211
- What do we got?
- Seventeen-year-old, 3 gunshot wounds...

635
00:37:17,284 --> 00:37:18,935
to the right chest. One to the left.

636
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:21,873
BP 90 over 60, pulse 120.
Intubated in the field.

637
00:37:21,881 --> 00:37:25,333
- He needs a bilateral chest tube.
- One for you and one for me.

638
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:30,457
Malucci, you do a central line.
On my count. One, two, three.

639
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:34,427
- Two chest tubes and a central line.
- Only got one chest tray.

640
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:37,213
- Get another.
- We'll share. 10-blade.

641
00:37:42,274 --> 00:37:45,146
- BP's 80. Pulse ox 92.
- Curved Kelly.

642
00:37:45,362 --> 00:37:48,197
- Twenty cc's for the lab.
- O-neg is here.

643
00:37:48,407 --> 00:37:49,606
Chest tube.

644
00:37:51,953 --> 00:37:55,193
Get this damn thing out of my way!
Somebody grab this badge and flip it.

645
00:37:57,344 --> 00:38:00,062
- Stitch, please.
- I'm in. Lock and load the infuser.

646
00:38:00,073 --> 00:38:03,590
- BP's down to 70.
-100 cc's on the right.

647
00:38:03,603 --> 00:38:07,340
- We got bleeding on your side, Dr. Greene.
- Ok, where's Benton?

648
00:38:07,357 --> 00:38:09,315
He got off at 6.

649
00:38:11,253 --> 00:38:14,141
We need a surgeon down here now!

650
00:38:19,414 --> 00:38:24,242
Give me the Foley. Come on!
30 cc syringe for Dr. Greene.

651
00:38:24,871 --> 00:38:26,781
- What are you doing?
- Check the balloon.

652
00:38:26,799 --> 00:38:29,834
- What are you doing?
- Check the balloon. Come on.

653
00:38:31,221 --> 00:38:35,171
If we can't put pressure on the bleeder
from the outside, we do it on the inside.

654
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:39,589
Pressure's down to 60.

655
00:38:39,607 --> 00:38:41,088
All right, tell me when.

656
00:38:41,309 --> 00:38:43,432
20 cc's.

657
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:47,515
There's 30 cc's.

658
00:38:50,028 --> 00:38:53,612
- Chest tube output's down to a trickle.
- Pressure's up to 80.

659
00:38:53,825 --> 00:38:56,543
Old army trick to tamponade
the subclavian.

660
00:38:56,554 --> 00:38:59,872
- Cool.
- Very cool.

661
00:39:01,819 --> 00:39:04,045
Let's get him up to the O.R.

662
00:39:22,412 --> 00:39:24,071
Dr. Carter?

663
00:39:26,242 --> 00:39:29,209
- How is she?
- She's resting comfortably.

664
00:39:29,321 --> 00:39:31,579
You can go in if you like.

665
00:39:49,322 --> 00:39:51,147
- Hey, Luka.
- Hey.

666
00:39:51,157 --> 00:39:53,600
- Want a lift?
- In that?

667
00:39:53,819 --> 00:39:57,687
It's my mom's. I had to pick up
some stuff from work.

668
00:39:57,958 --> 00:39:59,783
- What, baby stuff?
- Yeah.

669
00:39:59,952 --> 00:40:02,075
Okay.

670
00:40:09,714 --> 00:40:11,506
- Here we are.
- Yeah.

671
00:40:11,851 --> 00:40:13,545
Let's see...

672
00:40:22,156 --> 00:40:24,856
- Let's get him this.
- He's 9 months old.

673
00:40:24,927 --> 00:40:27,819
You're never too early to start.

674
00:40:36,916 --> 00:40:39,072
Carlos, do you think your daddy's silly?

675
00:40:39,286 --> 00:40:44,546
What about this? You like one
of these? "Pull over. Pull over."

676
00:40:45,294 --> 00:40:47,019
He is silly.

677
00:40:47,188 --> 00:40:52,016
Elizabeth, I wanted to apologize
for being abrupt.

678
00:40:52,028 --> 00:40:54,002
- You mean rude.
- Yes.

679
00:40:54,114 --> 00:40:55,792
I'll think about it.

680
00:40:55,966 --> 00:40:59,602
You could apologize actually
for that crap at the head CT.

681
00:40:59,621 --> 00:41:03,350
What?! No way on earth will I apologize
for that. You put me on the spot.

682
00:41:03,376 --> 00:41:05,613
Yeah, but I expected you
to give the right answer.

683
00:41:05,688 --> 00:41:07,464
The right answer?

684
00:41:07,973 --> 00:41:10,565
That Lawrence is still bugging you,
isn't he?

685
00:41:11,085 --> 00:41:12,912
Just because he can diagnose something...

686
00:41:12,941 --> 00:41:15,395
without having to order
every test in the book.

687
00:41:15,708 --> 00:41:17,272
He may have some fancy moves in Trauma...

688
00:41:17,367 --> 00:41:20,231
but he doesn't know
how to function in an inner-city ER.

689
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:22,942
- You're afraid you might learn something?
- He's too slow,

690
00:41:22,977 --> 00:41:24,420
he spends hours with every patient,

691
00:41:24,504 --> 00:41:28,415
and then he ties up the residents
chattering on about the Radovici sign.

692
00:41:28,692 --> 00:41:31,600
- The what?
- You don't know about that?

693
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:34,442
- No, what is it?
- I don't think I should tell you.

694
00:41:34,708 --> 00:41:36,533
Mark.

695
00:41:37,503 --> 00:41:40,989
Just one more.
Come on, Reece, please. Okay.

696
00:41:41,216 --> 00:41:43,124
Maybe not.

697
00:41:43,761 --> 00:41:46,513
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

698
00:41:47,191 --> 00:41:50,179
What are you doing?
Jackie, you think he looks like me?

699
00:41:50,295 --> 00:41:53,847
I hope not. He's got enough problems.

700
00:41:55,635 --> 00:41:57,975
Hey, when I was a kid,
did I have a lot of ear infections?

701
00:41:57,988 --> 00:42:01,939
I don't know, Peter. I was your sister,
not your mother.

702
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:05,945
You were a scrawny little thing.
Always coming down with something.

703
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:08,082
No wonder you got into medicine.

704
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,905
Thanks.

705
00:42:10,654 --> 00:42:12,994
I'll take him up to bed.

706
00:42:15,385 --> 00:42:17,709
- Do the washing up.
- All right.

707
00:42:17,721 --> 00:42:21,173
Dry up too. Don't leave everything
just sitting on the side.

708
00:42:23,546 --> 00:42:26,813
I love you. Do you love me?
Get out of here.

709
00:42:27,025 --> 00:42:29,218
Come on, my baby.

710
00:42:46,409 --> 00:42:50,839
- You live here?
- I told you it's in the water.

711
00:42:50,956 --> 00:42:55,884
- Yeah, but I mean, is it sanitary?
- Sure.

712
00:42:56,255 --> 00:43:00,803
- What do you do in winter?
- In winter I go south.

713
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:03,348
Like the birds.

714
00:43:04,265 --> 00:43:09,394
- Thank you for the lift.
- Sure. See you.

715
00:43:12,592 --> 00:43:14,368
Sure.

716
00:43:28,096 --> 00:43:31,432
You scratch the thenar eminence...

717
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:36,228
causing ipsilateral contractions
of the chin muscles.

718
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:38,316
Definitely contracting.

719
00:43:38,334 --> 00:43:41,569
- Is that a good thing?
- Sadly, no.

720
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,965
It indicates increased
intracranial pressure.

721
00:43:46,044 --> 00:43:48,266
Disturbances of the brain.

722
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:52,512
Which explains why
you're working with Romano.
