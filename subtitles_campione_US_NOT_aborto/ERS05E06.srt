1
00:00:07,243 --> 00:00:08,870
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:09,078 --> 00:00:10,568
Dr. Carter, hi.

3
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:14,238
- As of today, I'm only an intern.
- I heard, I couldn't believe it.

4
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:16,042
Kerry, this is Dr. Dan Litvak.

5
00:00:16,252 --> 00:00:17,719
Just here to get a few tips?

6
00:00:17,921 --> 00:00:20,253
I had an interview
for the Chief position.

7
00:00:20,456 --> 00:00:23,516
- Have you not told everyone?
- My son's deaf, I know.

8
00:00:23,726 --> 00:00:26,820
- Don't you set policy?
- I'm here for the ride-along.

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,761
If he gets vomit in his lungs,
he could die of aspiration pneumonia.

10
00:00:30,967 --> 00:00:32,901
Two of your classmates almost died.

11
00:00:34,237 --> 00:00:37,070
It was stupid of me to think you
could take responsibility.

12
00:00:45,348 --> 00:00:47,782
Doug, what are you doing? It's 5:00.

13
00:00:47,984 --> 00:00:50,418
I'm a week behind
on my Q and A reports.

14
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,747
And that is the good news.

15
00:00:53,389 --> 00:00:54,856
How long have you been up?

16
00:00:55,058 --> 00:00:56,548
Haven't been to sleep.

17
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:59,557
Oh, God, anything I can do?

18
00:01:00,863 --> 00:01:03,730
Go back to bed, no use
both of us being miserable.

19
00:01:04,701 --> 00:01:07,363
No, it's Ionely there without you.

20
00:01:07,804 --> 00:01:10,295
Keep that up, I'm never gonna finish.

21
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,800
Sorry.

22
00:01:15,178 --> 00:01:17,908
Now I know how you felt
when you opened your clinic.

23
00:01:18,114 --> 00:01:20,139
It's pretty scary, huh?

24
00:01:22,352 --> 00:01:24,115
Are we both nuts?

25
00:01:24,487 --> 00:01:25,476
Yeah.

26
00:01:26,589 --> 00:01:28,079
But it's worth it.

27
00:01:33,062 --> 00:01:36,122
Oh, Dr. Carter.
I didn't think you'd be up yet.

28
00:01:36,332 --> 00:01:37,959
I left you a note.

29
00:01:39,702 --> 00:01:42,899
I just wanted to tell you
how sorry I am that you lost...

30
00:01:43,106 --> 00:01:45,631
...your R.A. Job because Halloween...
- Me too.

31
00:01:45,842 --> 00:01:50,370
I wondered if you thought it might
help if I wrote the dean a letter?

32
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,378
Thanks, I think you've
done enough already.

33
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:56,177
At least I could help pack.
I'm not on until 7:00.

34
00:01:56,386 --> 00:01:58,616
- No, I can manage.
- Where will you live?

35
00:01:58,821 --> 00:01:59,651
Ow!

36
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:01,656
That's my leg.

37
00:02:03,626 --> 00:02:06,595
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize you had company.

38
00:02:07,797 --> 00:02:09,059
See you at the hospital.

39
00:02:11,701 --> 00:02:13,896
I'm very glad you're moving.

40
00:02:21,711 --> 00:02:25,841
So your beef is with nurses asking
stupid questions over the radio.

41
00:02:26,049 --> 00:02:30,008
I'll say. Patients freak out when
someone asks if they got track marks.

42
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:32,244
All right, I'll talk to the nurses.

43
00:02:32,755 --> 00:02:37,692
They asked me to remind you not to
restock your rig with their supplies.

44
00:02:38,027 --> 00:02:40,120
Oh, man, that is so lame.

45
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:44,265
Nothing'll change unless we all throw
our gripes out on the table.

46
00:02:44,467 --> 00:02:47,402
Want to get some breakfast
before we head back?

47
00:02:47,603 --> 00:02:50,538
Definitely, I'm hungry.
I could use an omelet and...

48
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,631
- What was that?
- Gunfire. Came from behind us.

49
00:02:54,377 --> 00:02:55,435
Looks like bangers.

50
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,607
Someone's down!

51
00:03:03,619 --> 00:03:07,453
Unit 63, we have a possible GSW
on the 1600 block of Halsted.

52
00:03:07,657 --> 00:03:09,147
Gunfire in the vicinity.

53
00:03:09,358 --> 00:03:10,416
Why don't you back up?

54
00:03:10,626 --> 00:03:12,423
We have to wait for a secure area.

55
00:03:12,628 --> 00:03:13,617
I don't hear gunfire.

56
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,889
That doesn't mean
it won't start again.

57
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:20,001
- I'm not gonna wait in here.
- Protocol says we wait for backup.

58
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,062
Wait!

59
00:03:24,607 --> 00:03:25,437
Damn it!

60
00:03:35,718 --> 00:03:37,549
What the hell are you doing?

61
00:03:38,654 --> 00:03:41,782
Did you hear that?
We should not be out here.

62
00:03:41,991 --> 00:03:44,789
Doesn't mean they'll come back.
Give me a hand.

63
00:03:44,994 --> 00:03:46,461
Is he shot?

64
00:03:46,762 --> 00:03:48,855
There's no entrance wound.
He's beat up.

65
00:03:49,065 --> 00:03:51,499
Ready to roll him? All right, go.

66
00:03:58,374 --> 00:03:59,807
Stopped breathing, intubate.

67
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:01,704
- Not here, in the rig.
- Now!

68
00:04:07,984 --> 00:04:10,714
There's too much blood, suction.

69
00:04:12,021 --> 00:04:14,353
Morales, gurney!

70
00:04:17,593 --> 00:04:20,221
- Can't see the cords.
- Want to crank his head back?

71
00:04:20,429 --> 00:04:21,726
We have to clear the C-spine.

72
00:04:22,632 --> 00:04:24,497
He's still not breathing.

73
00:04:25,101 --> 00:04:26,090
Extend his neck.

74
00:04:29,805 --> 00:04:31,136
You ER guys are nuts!

75
00:04:31,374 --> 00:04:33,604
- Yes, I'm in.
- Okay.

76
00:04:33,943 --> 00:04:36,104
Let's move him and bag him.

77
00:04:36,312 --> 00:04:38,712
One, two, three.

78
00:04:44,353 --> 00:04:45,342
I'm losing his pulse.

79
00:04:45,555 --> 00:04:47,887
We have to start two large IVs.

80
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,819
You want to do that here too?

81
00:04:50,626 --> 00:04:52,890
No, we'll do it while we're rolling.

82
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:58,760
Next time you decide to do
a ride-along, I'm taking a day off.

83
00:04:59,435 --> 00:05:02,131
Lights and sirens, let's go!

84
00:05:53,823 --> 00:05:55,051
Morning, what have we got?

85
00:05:55,258 --> 00:05:59,456
Sixteen-year-old male found beaten.
Sustained concussion, contusions...

86
00:05:59,662 --> 00:06:04,463
Head, neck and extremities.
BP's 140 over 80, pulse 110, regular.

87
00:06:05,134 --> 00:06:08,433
Good air entry bilaterally.
No evidence of pneumothorax.

88
00:06:08,638 --> 00:06:11,835
- Any I.D.?
- No, just a couple of bucks.

89
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,976
Everybody, on my count:
One, two, three.

90
00:06:16,512 --> 00:06:18,980
- Cowboy Greene to the rescue.
- Babinski's normal.

91
00:06:19,181 --> 00:06:22,878
- BP 120/78.
- Regular rate and rhythm.

92
00:06:23,085 --> 00:06:26,885
- Spontaneous eye-opening.
- Okay, can you wiggle your toes?

93
00:06:27,857 --> 00:06:29,256
Yep, follows commands.

94
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:32,825
- How's he doing?
- Stable, no apparent neurodeficits.

95
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:34,189
That was some crazy stunt.

96
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,693
You lucked out this time.

97
00:06:38,034 --> 00:06:39,160
What was that all about?

98
00:06:40,202 --> 00:06:43,000
Paramedics got perturbed,
I tubed him in the field.

99
00:06:43,205 --> 00:06:44,467
Radiology's here.

100
00:06:44,674 --> 00:06:48,132
So word is Dan Litvak
turned down ER Chief.

101
00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:51,505
- What happened?
- He played the committee for patsies.

102
00:06:51,714 --> 00:06:54,842
Used the offer to negotiate
a bigger salary back home.

103
00:06:55,051 --> 00:06:59,078
I shouldn't tell you this,
but you're the only other candidate.

104
00:06:59,288 --> 00:07:00,448
Really?

105
00:07:01,324 --> 00:07:04,487
- "Cat lover seeks roommate."
- Forget it.

106
00:07:04,694 --> 00:07:08,528
Would you consider joining
a communal vegetarian household?

107
00:07:09,031 --> 00:07:12,762
All right, here's one: "Furnished
apartment in old townhome.

108
00:07:12,968 --> 00:07:15,300
Access to full kitchen.
Many amenities."

109
00:07:15,504 --> 00:07:18,405
- That sounds promising.
- And not far from the hospital.

110
00:07:18,607 --> 00:07:21,132
I can set up an appointment
for you after work.

111
00:07:21,344 --> 00:07:23,403
- All right, see you later.
- Bye.

112
00:07:23,612 --> 00:07:27,070
Take a deep breath.
All right, blow hard. Hard!

113
00:07:29,852 --> 00:07:31,877
- You all right?
- Yeah.

114
00:07:32,254 --> 00:07:34,381
Pulse ox holding at 98.

115
00:07:35,057 --> 00:07:37,582
I'm Dr. Greene.
Do you know what happened to you?

116
00:07:37,793 --> 00:07:40,853
I was with a john.
Bangers tried to rob us.

117
00:07:41,063 --> 00:07:42,928
And my john pulled a gun.

118
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:45,366
That's where I go blank.

119
00:07:47,403 --> 00:07:49,064
Found you on the street.

120
00:07:49,472 --> 00:07:50,871
Brought you here by ambulance.

121
00:07:51,073 --> 00:07:53,268
Why were you cruising
in my neighborhood?

122
00:07:53,476 --> 00:07:56,036
Sometimes I ride along
with paramedics.

123
00:07:58,481 --> 00:08:01,177
You're the first guy
who's ever saved my life.

124
00:08:01,384 --> 00:08:04,046
I don't go out in the street
for just anybody.

125
00:08:05,054 --> 00:08:07,614
- Guess I gotta grant you a wish now.
- What?

126
00:08:08,524 --> 00:08:13,587
Like <i>I Dream of Jeannie,</i> when Major
Nelson rescued her from a bottle.

127
00:08:14,997 --> 00:08:16,726
Start with your name and age.

128
00:08:17,299 --> 00:08:18,857
Kevin Delaney.

129
00:08:19,301 --> 00:08:20,928
I'm 16 years old.

130
00:08:21,203 --> 00:08:23,831
Lily, why don't you find
Kevin's labs...

131
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:26,439
...and see if you can get us
an Exam Room.

132
00:08:26,642 --> 00:08:27,631
Sure.

133
00:08:28,511 --> 00:08:29,500
Where do you live?

134
00:08:29,712 --> 00:08:31,111
Where you found me.

135
00:08:31,614 --> 00:08:34,447
- Any family?
- None who want to know me.

136
00:08:34,917 --> 00:08:36,077
Why is that?

137
00:08:36,786 --> 00:08:39,118
Year ago my old man caught me...

138
00:08:39,321 --> 00:08:44,258
...having sex with my gymnastics
coach, he kicked me out of the house.

139
00:08:45,661 --> 00:08:47,458
Any other details you want to hear?

140
00:08:49,665 --> 00:08:52,998
So you survive by hustling.

141
00:08:53,502 --> 00:08:56,960
Yeah, well, someone's gotta pay
the bills, right?

142
00:08:57,339 --> 00:08:58,328
Use condoms?

143
00:08:58,541 --> 00:08:59,974
Sometimes.

144
00:09:00,176 --> 00:09:02,440
Customers pay more
to ride me bareback.

145
00:09:04,046 --> 00:09:06,310
We have a new rapid HIV test.

146
00:09:06,515 --> 00:09:09,484
You can get results in 20 minutes.
How about it?

147
00:09:10,219 --> 00:09:11,652
You want to bet I'm positive?

148
00:09:11,854 --> 00:09:13,719
Well, if you are, we can treat you.

149
00:09:14,223 --> 00:09:15,315
Sure.

150
00:09:19,395 --> 00:09:21,522
Looks like a good turnout
for the BP screening.

151
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:25,860
I posted signs at the Senior Center.
If it stops raining, we'll be jammed.

152
00:09:26,635 --> 00:09:28,569
- Not so tight!
- I'm sorry, Mr. Levy...

153
00:09:28,771 --> 00:09:31,899
...but to get an accurate reading,
it has to be snug.

154
00:09:32,107 --> 00:09:33,438
It's too damn tight!

155
00:09:33,642 --> 00:09:35,507
Take it easy, I'll loosen it a bit.

156
00:09:35,711 --> 00:09:37,269
My arm's gonna fall off.

157
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,744
Next time we should extend
the outreach.

158
00:09:39,949 --> 00:09:42,941
Go into the community, take BPs.
What do you think?

159
00:09:43,152 --> 00:09:46,485
That's not a bad idea.
Okay, your pressure's fine.

160
00:09:46,689 --> 00:09:47,849
No thanks to you.

161
00:09:48,057 --> 00:09:51,754
- Carol, you page me?
- Oh, yeah, I'll be right back.

162
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,884
What's up?

163
00:09:54,096 --> 00:09:56,690
- I'm swamped here.
- I know, I know.

164
00:09:59,568 --> 00:10:01,900
- A lab coat?
- Yes.

165
00:10:02,571 --> 00:10:05,131
It's what every
division head should wear.

166
00:10:05,341 --> 00:10:06,603
No backing out now.

167
00:10:06,809 --> 00:10:08,106
What do you think?

168
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:10,835
- Come here.
- I thought you said you're busy.

169
00:10:13,282 --> 00:10:15,250
- Not that busy.
- No?

170
00:10:16,585 --> 00:10:17,779
Carter, you paged me?

171
00:10:19,522 --> 00:10:23,458
Sixty-eight-year-old male with
a history of abdominal surgery.

172
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:25,593
I'm thinking small bowel obstruction.

173
00:10:25,794 --> 00:10:27,921
- You do a three-way?
- Right here.

174
00:10:28,564 --> 00:10:31,328
Air-fluid levels, and he's got
a stepladder pattern.

175
00:10:31,934 --> 00:10:33,196
Good call.

176
00:10:35,037 --> 00:10:37,597
- I must've driven you crazy.
- What do you mean?

177
00:10:37,806 --> 00:10:40,468
My student, she's driving me nuts.

178
00:10:40,676 --> 00:10:44,203
Makes stupid mistakes.
Asks too many questions.

179
00:10:44,413 --> 00:10:46,142
Shows poor judgment.

180
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:49,783
- How'd you put up with me?
- I never gave you any thought.

181
00:10:49,985 --> 00:10:53,045
- You didn't?
- Medical students don't know anything.

182
00:10:53,255 --> 00:10:56,281
It's your job to teach them,
not be their friend.

183
00:11:02,164 --> 00:11:05,600
Exhale, Mrs. Delpit,
like you're blowing out candles.

184
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:11,433
Before listening with a stethoscope,
test for tactile fremitus.

185
00:11:12,575 --> 00:11:16,011
By placing your hand
on the patient's back...

186
00:11:16,211 --> 00:11:17,974
...and asking her to repeat "99."

187
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,842
I haven't tested for that
since my first year.

188
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:23,848
I have to be sure that you
can do a complete exam.

189
00:11:25,888 --> 00:11:26,877
All right.

190
00:11:27,156 --> 00:11:30,683
Mrs. Delpit, will you please
repeat "99" for me.

191
00:11:30,893 --> 00:11:31,882
Ninety-nine...

192
00:11:32,394 --> 00:11:33,861
...99...

193
00:11:34,129 --> 00:11:36,097
...99...

194
00:11:41,403 --> 00:11:43,496
Blood alcohol level came back.

195
00:11:43,706 --> 00:11:44,695
Did I set a record?

196
00:11:44,907 --> 00:11:47,876
No, but it's up there, 0.16.

197
00:11:48,077 --> 00:11:52,036
That's nothing, last time
I got picked up I scored a 26.

198
00:11:52,715 --> 00:11:54,376
I also have your HIV results.

199
00:11:55,217 --> 00:11:56,206
It's AIDS, right?

200
00:11:56,719 --> 00:11:58,311
No, good news, you're negative.

201
00:12:00,122 --> 00:12:02,682
I guess my johns don't need
rubbers after all.

202
00:12:03,826 --> 00:12:05,657
I'm gonna charge them a fortune.

203
00:12:05,861 --> 00:12:08,295
You won't stay negative
if you don't use protection.

204
00:12:10,532 --> 00:12:12,500
Time to get your life together.

205
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:16,933
Yeah, I do kind of stink.

206
00:12:17,373 --> 00:12:21,036
Do you think I could get a shower?
Maybe some clean clothes?

207
00:12:21,844 --> 00:12:25,211
I'll have the nurses come
and take you to the shower room.

208
00:12:25,814 --> 00:12:26,803
Care to join me?

209
00:12:28,584 --> 00:12:30,449
No, thanks, I had one this morning.

210
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,621
Peter, hold on.
Have you got a moment?

211
00:12:34,823 --> 00:12:37,189
Nope, I've got
a small bowel obstruction.

212
00:12:37,393 --> 00:12:41,159
I know, I'm operating with you.
Meet your new intern.

213
00:12:41,363 --> 00:12:43,194
- Since when?
- This morning, if you want.

214
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:45,629
- Go ahead, bring him in.
- Okay.

215
00:12:46,001 --> 00:12:47,559
Was this Anspaugh's idea?

216
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:52,070
It was mine, but Anspaugh supports it.
Enthusiastically, I might add.

217
00:12:52,608 --> 00:12:54,303
- I don't know.
- Come on, Peter.

218
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:57,001
Don't be a wet blanket.
Think, no more Dale Scott.

219
00:12:57,212 --> 00:12:59,942
And you have the chance to work
with an alluring intern.

220
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:01,639
I'm not comfortable with that.

221
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,715
Why not? We've made a great team.

222
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:07,150
When we were both Residents.
Now I'd have to be your boss.

223
00:13:08,657 --> 00:13:10,284
I don't mind if you don't.

224
00:13:10,492 --> 00:13:14,553
I'll be accused of playing favorites
if I don't treat you like an intern.

225
00:13:14,763 --> 00:13:16,594
I don't ask for special treatment...

226
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,360
...just the chance to do something
more than pull drains.

227
00:13:20,569 --> 00:13:22,628
Elizabeth, I don't think it'll be...

228
00:13:22,838 --> 00:13:24,533
I don't think it'd be good for us.

229
00:13:25,641 --> 00:13:28,542
All right, I'll think about it, okay?

230
00:13:28,977 --> 00:13:30,501
You know what, you don't have to.

231
00:13:30,713 --> 00:13:32,874
I already heard your answer.

232
00:13:38,287 --> 00:13:39,379
Orange juice?

233
00:13:39,588 --> 00:13:42,751
You want orange juice, Reece?
Is that what you want?

234
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,823
- Coffee, please.
- You want a sip?

235
00:13:45,027 --> 00:13:47,825
- You guys taking a lunch break?
- Hey. Yeah.

236
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,430
Figured we'd get some air
since the rain stopped.

237
00:13:50,632 --> 00:13:51,621
Yeah, me too.

238
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:53,961
He's getting so big.
You're gonna be...

239
00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:56,637
...tall like your daddy,
aren't you, huh?

240
00:13:57,172 --> 00:13:59,697
I wasn't aware that Reece
had a hearing problem.

241
00:14:00,476 --> 00:14:03,468
Yeah, we just found out recently.
He's deaf.

242
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:04,805
Come on, man.

243
00:14:05,714 --> 00:14:08,683
What approach do you use
for language acquisition...

244
00:14:08,884 --> 00:14:10,681
...if you don't mind my asking?

245
00:14:10,886 --> 00:14:13,116
We're working with an audiologist.

246
00:14:13,655 --> 00:14:15,919
Have you looked into speech reading?

247
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:19,822
He has residual hearing.
I'm looking for an aggressive ENT...

248
00:14:20,028 --> 00:14:21,996
...who'll consider him
for a cochlear implant.

249
00:14:22,197 --> 00:14:24,358
They'd have to destroy
his residual hearing.

250
00:14:24,566 --> 00:14:26,898
Yeah, but the technology
is very advanced.

251
00:14:27,102 --> 00:14:29,366
You should talk to Lisa Parks
at U of C.

252
00:14:29,571 --> 00:14:32,938
She's an outstanding physician
and has expertise in this.

253
00:14:33,142 --> 00:14:34,302
She's a friend of yours?

254
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:37,104
I'll give you her number.
She's cutting edge.

255
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,240
Thanks.

256
00:14:40,749 --> 00:14:44,241
ER? Yep, hold on. Dr. Ross.

257
00:14:44,453 --> 00:14:45,545
I'm busy here, Jerry.

258
00:14:45,754 --> 00:14:47,745
They said it was urgent.

259
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,687
All right.

260
00:14:50,359 --> 00:14:52,122
This is Dr. Ross.

261
00:14:53,996 --> 00:14:55,691
You too, Carol.

262
00:14:56,865 --> 00:14:58,264
Where are you?

263
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,737
I was just thinking about you.

264
00:15:02,938 --> 00:15:04,599
I have to get my sugar checked!

265
00:15:04,807 --> 00:15:07,071
Gotta go. What's the problem?

266
00:15:07,276 --> 00:15:09,676
That other nurse said
I have to come back.

267
00:15:09,878 --> 00:15:11,368
I have sugar diabetes.

268
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,674
I schlepped all the way here
on a bus in the rain...

269
00:15:14,883 --> 00:15:16,714
...and she says I need an appointment!

270
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:19,513
- Now, what is that?
- Okay, hang on.

271
00:15:19,721 --> 00:15:23,589
Did you tell Mr. Levy he'd need
an appointment for his blood check?

272
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:26,420
Did he give you that song
about taking the bus?

273
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:31,224
- He's got other complaints.
- Ladies, I hate to interrupt...

274
00:15:31,433 --> 00:15:34,197
...but I haven't had a bite
to eat all day.

275
00:15:34,403 --> 00:15:37,634
I have sugar diabetes. Hello?

276
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,604
Okay, Mr. Levy,
I'll test your blood glucose once...

277
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:43,300
...without an appointment.
Then we'll get you food.

278
00:15:43,512 --> 00:15:44,638
- You're an angel.
- Okay.

279
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,644
Hope you got all afternoon.

280
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,182
How did the accident happen, Kate?

281
00:15:51,286 --> 00:15:54,016
I lost it on gravel
coming down through a turn.

282
00:15:54,223 --> 00:15:56,657
Your dad said
you hit a curb and then fell.

283
00:15:56,859 --> 00:15:59,487
She fell onto the curb
after slipping on gravel.

284
00:16:00,429 --> 00:16:01,919
Okay, have a seat.

285
00:16:02,798 --> 00:16:03,787
You might have a fracture.

286
00:16:03,999 --> 00:16:08,459
I'll call Ortho after we get an x-ray.
We'll be right back.

287
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,934
Have Medical Records send up
any old charts.

288
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:12,504
Good idea.

289
00:16:12,841 --> 00:16:14,809
You feel any pain when I press here?

290
00:16:15,444 --> 00:16:17,412
Yeah, a lot.

291
00:16:19,181 --> 00:16:21,911
- When did you first feel the pain?
- In the shower.

292
00:16:22,351 --> 00:16:24,979
You had a blow to your leg.
Could be a blood clot.

293
00:16:25,187 --> 00:16:27,587
That's no big deal.
I've had them before.

294
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,981
- You have?
- Yeah, sure.

295
00:16:30,192 --> 00:16:33,992
I've got a protein S deficiency.
My blood clots all the time.

296
00:16:34,196 --> 00:16:36,255
Should've seen the mother
I had a year ago.

297
00:16:36,465 --> 00:16:38,899
I wish you would've told me
your history before.

298
00:16:39,101 --> 00:16:41,763
I can't take care of you
if you're not straight.

299
00:16:43,071 --> 00:16:44,333
I can't be straight.

300
00:16:46,008 --> 00:16:48,135
Guess you want to order
a coag panel...

301
00:16:48,343 --> 00:16:51,107
...and clotting studies,
and start a heparin drip?

302
00:16:52,547 --> 00:16:54,879
When was the last time
you were hospitalized?

303
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,551
Right before I took off from home.

304
00:16:58,153 --> 00:17:00,747
All right, I'm gonna
start you on the heparin.

305
00:17:00,956 --> 00:17:04,153
Then we're gonna move
to the Coumadin...

306
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:08,125
...before you're to be discharged.
- No, I'm not taking Coumadin.

307
00:17:08,997 --> 00:17:13,900
Why not? You have a disease requiring
you to take a blood thinner forever.

308
00:17:14,102 --> 00:17:17,333
Coumadin and the streets don't mix.
You ought to know that.

309
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,370
You don't want me back,
bleeding my brains out...

310
00:17:20,575 --> 00:17:22,236
...because I got drunk
and hit my head.

311
00:17:22,444 --> 00:17:23,843
You'd rather die of a blood clot?

312
00:17:24,046 --> 00:17:26,412
I don't sweat it, why should you?

313
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:31,114
How much insulin did you take,
Mr. Levy?

314
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,309
I'm not sure.

315
00:17:32,521 --> 00:17:35,183
The lady who used to come
always gave it to me.

316
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:39,827
She also used to trim my toenails.
I think one of them is infected.

317
00:17:40,028 --> 00:17:41,290
I got pain in my left side.

318
00:17:41,496 --> 00:17:43,054
Mr. Levy's still here.

319
00:17:43,265 --> 00:17:47,224
Apparently, he took too much insulin.
His blood sugar is 61.

320
00:17:47,436 --> 00:17:50,098
I told you I needed to have
my blood checked.

321
00:17:50,305 --> 00:17:53,536
Look, you were right.
I'm really stuck.

322
00:17:53,742 --> 00:17:55,733
His home health aide took a new job.

323
00:17:55,944 --> 00:17:56,933
- Any family?
- No.

324
00:17:57,145 --> 00:17:59,739
His wife died last year.
No one else in town.

325
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:02,109
We could try to get
a temporary placement...

326
00:18:02,317 --> 00:18:03,511
...until we find a new aide.

327
00:18:03,719 --> 00:18:05,243
I'm not going to a nursing home!

328
00:18:05,454 --> 00:18:07,217
Just temporarily, Mr. Levy.

329
00:18:08,256 --> 00:18:09,985
The desk guy said Mr. Levy's here?

330
00:18:10,192 --> 00:18:11,284
- You got my Kung Pao?
- Yes, sir.

331
00:18:12,127 --> 00:18:14,254
- Egg rolls?
- Yes, sir, all right here.

332
00:18:14,463 --> 00:18:16,158
- That's $8.50.
- Very reasonable.

333
00:18:16,365 --> 00:18:20,062
- You ordered Chinese?
- She said I needed to eat.

334
00:18:20,268 --> 00:18:23,465
- I'll get my wallet.
- Why don't you make it an even 10?

335
00:18:23,672 --> 00:18:25,037
Where's my fortune cookie?

336
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,207
I was just wondering...

337
00:18:26,408 --> 00:18:29,070
...am I gonna get to work
with other ER Residents?

338
00:18:29,277 --> 00:18:31,745
Why, is there a problem?

339
00:18:31,947 --> 00:18:35,906
No, I just thought I'll learn more
by working with a variety of teachers.

340
00:18:36,118 --> 00:18:37,676
That's up to the Attendings.

341
00:18:37,886 --> 00:18:40,013
Why don't you tell me
about this patient?

342
00:18:40,722 --> 00:18:44,351
Brad Enloe, 12,
history of recurrent leukemia.

343
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,652
Relapsed after
second induction of chemo.

344
00:18:46,862 --> 00:18:49,524
He's here today for a fever
and a sore throat.

345
00:18:49,731 --> 00:18:51,255
Poor kid's been through a lot.

346
00:18:51,466 --> 00:18:55,527
It's our job to treat the patient,
not feel sorry for him.

347
00:18:56,405 --> 00:19:00,273
Hi, Brad, I'm Dr. Carter.
This is my student, Lucy Knight.

348
00:19:00,475 --> 00:19:02,773
I hear your throat hurts.

349
00:19:02,978 --> 00:19:04,912
Yeah, it started this morning.

350
00:19:05,113 --> 00:19:06,944
He had a temp of 101.

351
00:19:07,149 --> 00:19:09,276
Check for cervical adenopathy...

352
00:19:09,484 --> 00:19:13,113
...and look for infection,
particularly in the ears and throat.

353
00:19:13,989 --> 00:19:16,480
- Does that hurt?
- Kind of.

354
00:19:16,691 --> 00:19:18,625
It's probably just a virus,
Mrs. Enloe.

355
00:19:19,528 --> 00:19:24,625
I'm gonna give Brad some ibuprofen,
and check his blood count.

356
00:19:24,966 --> 00:19:27,127
He's a candidate
for immunotoxin therapy.

357
00:19:27,736 --> 00:19:31,263
But unfortunately, he has
to be hospitalized to get the drug...

358
00:19:31,473 --> 00:19:36,035
...and our insurance turned him down.
They won't pay for experiments.

359
00:19:36,244 --> 00:19:39,702
If his neutrophil count
comes back under 500...

360
00:19:39,915 --> 00:19:41,542
...we'll admit him for antibiotics.

361
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,718
He could get immunotoxins on the side.

362
00:19:44,953 --> 00:19:46,045
Is that a possibility?

363
00:19:47,322 --> 00:19:50,849
Why don't we cross that bridge
when we have the results?

364
00:19:55,363 --> 00:19:59,299
Does your clinic have any information
about shelters for runaways?

365
00:19:59,534 --> 00:20:01,502
- This for the kid you saved?
- You heard?

366
00:20:01,703 --> 00:20:05,639
I thought you were smoothing
things out between ER and paramedics.

367
00:20:05,841 --> 00:20:09,402
- I got a little carried away.
- Doesn't matter, you're a hero.

368
00:20:09,778 --> 00:20:12,474
- Yeah, if I don't kill him.
- What?

369
00:20:12,681 --> 00:20:14,546
He's got a clotting disorder.

370
00:20:14,749 --> 00:20:17,650
If I give him a blood thinner,
he could die in the street.

371
00:20:17,853 --> 00:20:20,219
If I don't treat him,
he could die of a clot.

372
00:20:20,422 --> 00:20:22,822
Oh, God, between a rock
and a hard place?

373
00:20:23,024 --> 00:20:26,482
Here's a pamphlet for a shelter
that takes in street kids.

374
00:20:26,695 --> 00:20:28,458
- Think you'll convince him?
- We'll see.

375
00:20:28,663 --> 00:20:30,358
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

376
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,361
Mr. Preston, can I talk to you?

377
00:20:33,568 --> 00:20:35,229
I'll be right back.

378
00:20:35,937 --> 00:20:39,703
I got Kate's old records. There's
a pattern that needs explaining.

379
00:20:39,908 --> 00:20:43,002
She wasn't riding a bicycle.
It's not what you're thinking.

380
00:20:43,211 --> 00:20:44,678
What is it?

381
00:20:49,251 --> 00:20:51,412
She was riding a unicycle.

382
00:20:51,987 --> 00:20:54,217
- A unicycle?
- Backwards, playing the violin.

383
00:20:54,422 --> 00:20:57,585
We were trying to break
a Guinness World Record.

384
00:20:57,792 --> 00:20:59,259
I didn't want word to get out.

385
00:21:00,695 --> 00:21:04,062
- And her split lip two months ago?
- Balancing glasses on her chin.

386
00:21:04,266 --> 00:21:07,099
- Knife cuts?
- We broke the potato-peeling record.

387
00:21:08,803 --> 00:21:10,634
Kate and I went through tough times.

388
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:14,468
I was looking for things we could
do together. It sounds crazy...

389
00:21:14,676 --> 00:21:17,440
...but I found a three-legged marathon
we could enter.

390
00:21:17,646 --> 00:21:22,413
We won, and we kind of got hooked,
started breaking all kinds of records.

391
00:21:27,822 --> 00:21:28,811
May I help you?

392
00:21:29,024 --> 00:21:32,425
Yeah, I'm Peter Benton from County.
Kerry Weaver referred me.

393
00:21:32,627 --> 00:21:36,154
I'm Sara Jackson. She's with
a patient. I'll introduce you.

394
00:21:36,364 --> 00:21:40,061
Excuse me, on the door
it says "Family Medicine."

395
00:21:40,268 --> 00:21:41,758
I thought she was a surgeon.

396
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:44,962
No, she has a family practice.

397
00:21:46,441 --> 00:21:50,878
Hi, I'm Dr. Benton. Listen,
don't let me interrupt your patient.

398
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:54,606
No, that's not a problem.
I'm happy that you came over.

399
00:21:56,885 --> 00:22:00,286
I'm sorry, there must be
some misunderstanding.

400
00:22:00,488 --> 00:22:03,548
No, Kerry told me about your son.

401
00:22:03,758 --> 00:22:08,786
I'd be happy to discuss cochlear
implants, and other options too.

402
00:22:10,098 --> 00:22:13,226
I guess she didn't tell you
I was deaf, huh?

403
00:22:13,435 --> 00:22:14,925
No, she didn't.

404
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,999
Dr. Parks asked that when you speak
to her, you look directly at her...

405
00:22:23,211 --> 00:22:24,269
...so she can read lips.

406
00:22:24,479 --> 00:22:28,415
Oh, I'm sorry. Look, I said,
I didn't know you were deaf.

407
00:22:29,451 --> 00:22:30,884
That's all right.

408
00:22:31,353 --> 00:22:35,312
Can we talk?
Do you have time for some coffee?

409
00:22:35,523 --> 00:22:37,514
Yeah, all right, yeah.

410
00:22:37,726 --> 00:22:42,026
Just let me finish up with
this patient, and then we'll all go.

411
00:22:43,298 --> 00:22:44,629
Great.

412
00:22:49,104 --> 00:22:53,905
You must be very confused trying
to decide what's best for your son.

413
00:22:54,109 --> 00:22:58,273
Look, I want my son to be able
to function in the world.

414
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:05,381
As you can see, I function
pretty well without an implant.

415
00:23:05,587 --> 00:23:09,785
Yeah, but if an implant can help
him to hear, why not get one?

416
00:23:12,861 --> 00:23:15,694
Well, there are other options.

417
00:23:17,399 --> 00:23:21,358
Look, I don't want my son to have
to depend on others, no offense.

418
00:23:24,606 --> 00:23:27,074
Do you know any deaf people?

419
00:23:27,909 --> 00:23:29,342
No, I don't.

420
00:23:30,812 --> 00:23:34,646
Have you ever thought that being deaf
might not be so terrible?

421
00:23:36,284 --> 00:23:38,411
So you're saying there's no problem?

422
00:23:40,221 --> 00:23:42,815
You can never know
what it's like being deaf.

423
00:23:43,024 --> 00:23:47,222
Just like I can never know
what it's like being black.

424
00:23:47,429 --> 00:23:52,264
I don't look at me being black
as a burden. That's who I am.

425
00:23:53,802 --> 00:23:58,671
And I don't look at my deafness
as a burden. That's who I am.

426
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:03,109
If you turn away
from your son's deafness...

427
00:24:03,311 --> 00:24:05,677
...you will be robbing him
of his identity.

428
00:24:06,948 --> 00:24:08,176
My son has a medical problem.

429
00:24:08,383 --> 00:24:10,613
I'm not turning away,
I'm trying to fix it.

430
00:24:17,826 --> 00:24:19,020
Late for a meeting?

431
00:24:19,227 --> 00:24:21,923
If I can get through
this administrative hellhole...

432
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:25,224
...maybe I'll get to see
a few kids again.

433
00:24:26,735 --> 00:24:29,033
You can do it, keep going.

434
00:24:31,606 --> 00:24:33,005
You're doing great, Dad.

435
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:35,574
Beats juggling cantaloupes.

436
00:24:35,777 --> 00:24:38,439
Two hours he's been at it,
hasn't dropped one yet.

437
00:24:40,482 --> 00:24:43,815
The orthopedic surgeon is gonna
come and examine your wrist.

438
00:24:44,018 --> 00:24:46,919
Is it all right if I watch
my dad till he gets here?

439
00:24:47,122 --> 00:24:49,818
He's trying to break
the juggling record.

440
00:24:50,024 --> 00:24:53,050
Kate, did your dad force you
to ride that unicycle?

441
00:24:53,261 --> 00:24:56,094
Force me? Oh, no, it was my idea.

442
00:24:56,297 --> 00:24:57,423
You've had a lot of injuries.

443
00:24:58,032 --> 00:25:00,865
Dad and I always take
Guinness-approved precautions.

444
00:25:01,069 --> 00:25:04,129
If you're gonna be a record breaker,
you gotta take chances.

445
00:25:04,339 --> 00:25:05,772
Play it safe and life's boring.

446
00:25:07,275 --> 00:25:11,439
Here's when we broke the marathon.
That's me and Dad, we're in the book.

447
00:25:12,247 --> 00:25:14,215
I'll give you Accutane for the acne.

448
00:25:14,416 --> 00:25:16,441
But you'll need birth control pills.

449
00:25:16,651 --> 00:25:18,516
Birth control pills?

450
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,245
Accutane is a very effective
medication.

451
00:25:21,456 --> 00:25:26,086
But if you were to get pregnant,
it could cause terrible birth defects.

452
00:25:26,294 --> 00:25:28,455
I won't have sex, I promised my mom.

453
00:25:29,464 --> 00:25:30,863
I believe you, Nava...

454
00:25:31,065 --> 00:25:35,559
...but it's my policy to give birth
control to girls who take Accutane.

455
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:37,465
My mom won't let me take them.

456
00:25:37,672 --> 00:25:39,697
Have her call me.
I'll explain it to her.

457
00:25:39,908 --> 00:25:41,739
I don't think she'll change her mind.

458
00:25:43,144 --> 00:25:45,135
Okay, then...

459
00:25:46,147 --> 00:25:48,047
...I can't give you this medication.

460
00:25:51,653 --> 00:25:55,555
- Brought you these.
- Thanks. What's that?

461
00:25:55,757 --> 00:25:57,122
You might want to read about...

462
00:25:57,325 --> 00:25:59,759
...advances on protein S deficiency.

463
00:25:59,961 --> 00:26:03,556
Hey, look, I like you,
but I'm really not worth it.

464
00:26:03,765 --> 00:26:05,733
There's a list of homeless shelters.

465
00:26:05,934 --> 00:26:09,165
If you can't go home,
you might as well go to one.

466
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:11,201
There you can take your Coumadin.

467
00:26:11,406 --> 00:26:13,897
Then what?
Maybe get a job at McDonald's?

468
00:26:14,108 --> 00:26:19,273
You're a smart guy.
You get a GED, maybe go to college.

469
00:26:19,481 --> 00:26:22,848
- Look, what's the use?
- Would you rather die on the streets?

470
00:26:28,089 --> 00:26:30,182
You know, you're cute
when you get angry.

471
00:26:30,725 --> 00:26:34,559
Is that the only way you can relate
to me, by turning me into a customer?

472
00:26:36,498 --> 00:26:38,898
Okay, I'll read them.

473
00:26:39,334 --> 00:26:41,029
Anything for you.

474
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:48,070
Hey, can you write me a scrip
for birth control pills?

475
00:26:48,276 --> 00:26:51,006
That young lady decided
to take them after all?

476
00:26:51,212 --> 00:26:52,907
Yeah, she said she would.

477
00:26:53,114 --> 00:26:54,672
You know...

478
00:26:56,417 --> 00:26:59,784
...you have no business
giving her birth control pills...

479
00:26:59,988 --> 00:27:02,252
...since she and her mom
don't want them.

480
00:27:02,457 --> 00:27:04,118
And what if she got pregnant?

481
00:27:04,325 --> 00:27:05,986
You heard, she's not sexually active.

482
00:27:06,194 --> 00:27:10,028
She's a teenager, that doesn't
guarantee she's not gonna have sex.

483
00:27:10,398 --> 00:27:12,491
You are undermining her choice.

484
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,827
Giving her the pills
isn't gonna make her have sex.

485
00:27:15,036 --> 00:27:17,903
Listen, how would you feel
if you were that girl...

486
00:27:18,106 --> 00:27:20,074
...and a white nurse
said she didn't trust you?

487
00:27:20,275 --> 00:27:22,743
I wouldn't like it
no matter what color.

488
00:27:23,211 --> 00:27:26,578
All I'm saying is, you don't know
that girl or her mother.

489
00:27:26,781 --> 00:27:28,408
You're volunteering to talk to her?

490
00:27:28,616 --> 00:27:32,609
No, I just think it's wrong for you
to force birth control on the girl.

491
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:36,688
Well, maybe.
But I'm not gonna take any chances.

492
00:27:36,891 --> 00:27:41,225
Dr. Carter, labs are back on
Brad Enloe. You should look at them.

493
00:27:41,896 --> 00:27:43,864
His neutrophil count's over 1000.

494
00:27:44,065 --> 00:27:45,965
- We can't admit him.
- He's not septic.

495
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:48,635
Right, he's only dying of leukemia.

496
00:27:48,836 --> 00:27:51,396
He vomited after I gave him ibuprofen.

497
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,871
- Really?
- Yep.

498
00:27:54,075 --> 00:27:56,236
- When?
- Couple of minutes ago.

499
00:27:58,112 --> 00:28:00,046
He's dehydrated.
We're gonna admit him.

500
00:28:00,248 --> 00:28:03,513
Call upstairs, tell them we have
an admit for Pedes.

501
00:28:03,718 --> 00:28:07,119
- He only vomited once.
- I know, make the call.

502
00:28:08,523 --> 00:28:10,889
- He needs to be rehydrated.
- I can start an IV.

503
00:28:11,092 --> 00:28:12,889
You shouldn't do one on the kid.

504
00:28:13,094 --> 00:28:14,857
- I can do it.
- Been through chemo.

505
00:28:15,063 --> 00:28:18,191
His veins are sclerosed.
Not this one.

506
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,232
- Hey, Doug.
- Hey!

507
00:28:20,435 --> 00:28:22,130
Write me a scrip
for birth control?

508
00:28:22,337 --> 00:28:24,305
- Thought you swore it off.
- For a patient.

509
00:28:24,505 --> 00:28:26,700
- When did you hear?
- Half-hour ago.

510
00:28:26,908 --> 00:28:28,239
Hey, Mark.

511
00:28:28,743 --> 00:28:30,438
Whenever you have a minute?

512
00:28:30,645 --> 00:28:32,374
Yeah, I'll be right there.

513
00:28:34,949 --> 00:28:37,577
Kerry knows this ER better than
anybody we'd hire.

514
00:28:37,785 --> 00:28:41,016
I agree, but the committee wants
a star with a reputation...

515
00:28:41,222 --> 00:28:42,484
...who can bring in grants.

516
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:46,057
- Mark, trauma's pulling up.
- I'll tell her.

517
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:50,594
You sure? Mark, no sense in telling
Kerry she was our second choice.

518
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:52,322
Only disappoint her even more.

519
00:28:53,034 --> 00:28:54,331
Right.

520
00:28:57,271 --> 00:29:00,399
- Here we go, here we go.
- What the hell?

521
00:29:00,608 --> 00:29:02,940
Brothers got into a fight
on the expressway...

522
00:29:03,144 --> 00:29:05,704
...Iost control.
I've never seen such a mess.

523
00:29:05,913 --> 00:29:08,677
- You idiot, I said turn left.
- Sorry, Marcus.

524
00:29:08,883 --> 00:29:11,078
You jackass.
Can't believe I let you drive.

525
00:29:11,285 --> 00:29:12,411
You never watch the road.

526
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:16,818
Eddy and Marcus Haney, carpet-layers.
Carpet cement spilled all over them.

527
00:29:17,025 --> 00:29:19,926
- Stuck to their seat.
- You get stuck, you're on your own.

528
00:29:20,128 --> 00:29:22,926
- You're a moron, you know that?
- Just relax.

529
00:29:23,131 --> 00:29:25,429
How can I relax
when that idiot did this?

530
00:29:25,633 --> 00:29:28,727
Okay, pulse is strong.
Pupils react to light.

531
00:29:28,936 --> 00:29:30,767
Lydia, get me a glove change here.

532
00:29:30,972 --> 00:29:33,998
This stuff is like taffy.
How's he doing?

533
00:29:35,476 --> 00:29:36,465
What is that?

534
00:29:39,313 --> 00:29:41,281
Got an impalement of some kind.

535
00:29:42,617 --> 00:29:46,951
Oh, my God! It looks like
some kind of tool with sharp prongs.

536
00:29:47,155 --> 00:29:48,486
Not the hand stretcher?

537
00:29:49,123 --> 00:29:50,522
- Four-by-fours.
- Eddy?

538
00:29:50,725 --> 00:29:52,215
Just don't move so much.

539
00:29:52,427 --> 00:29:54,622
- We're gonna take care of him.
- Oh, man!

540
00:29:54,829 --> 00:29:57,320
Bleeding man here.
Let's take him to Trauma!

541
00:29:57,532 --> 00:29:58,965
Gently.

542
00:29:59,467 --> 00:30:02,527
- Malik, try and get monitor leads on.
- How?

543
00:30:02,737 --> 00:30:05,228
Get a tongue depressor,
scrape off a few spots.

544
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,873
Why did Eddy stop talking?

545
00:30:07,075 --> 00:30:09,066
Hold still.
If you move, you'll kill him.

546
00:30:09,277 --> 00:30:11,609
- Pulse ox falling.
- Stand by with intubation.

547
00:30:11,813 --> 00:30:14,509
I'll get a tray and an 8.0 ET tube.

548
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:16,974
Covering Dr. Benton, need consult?

549
00:30:17,185 --> 00:30:20,154
We've got an impalement.
Watch out for the glue.

550
00:30:20,354 --> 00:30:23,482
- Lucy, have you ever intubated?
- No, but I'd like to.

551
00:30:23,691 --> 00:30:24,885
Pretty tough intubation.

552
00:30:25,093 --> 00:30:26,720
Let's find out, talk her through.

553
00:30:27,028 --> 00:30:28,017
Great.

554
00:30:29,597 --> 00:30:31,929
Runs of PVCs when he's jostled...

555
00:30:32,133 --> 00:30:35,125
...from the tool against the heart.
Carter, get the crash cart.

556
00:30:35,336 --> 00:30:36,598
- Lydia?
- On it.

557
00:30:36,804 --> 00:30:39,898
Malik, we need the cutter down here
as fast as you can.

558
00:30:40,108 --> 00:30:42,872
Hang in there, Eddy, all right?
You're gonna be okay.

559
00:30:43,077 --> 00:30:44,237
Carter, I need you here...

560
00:30:44,445 --> 00:30:48,814
...and carefully pull Marcus away
so that Lucy has room to intubate.

561
00:30:50,852 --> 00:30:52,649
- Can you get in?
- Yeah, a little more.

562
00:30:52,854 --> 00:30:54,651
Lydia, snap some pictures.

563
00:30:54,856 --> 00:30:58,087
New policy: We're documenting
our interesting traumas.

564
00:30:58,292 --> 00:30:59,281
Take her through it.

565
00:30:59,494 --> 00:31:01,553
All right, pass the tube.

566
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:06,698
Not too far.

567
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:10,728
All right, take out the scope.

568
00:31:10,938 --> 00:31:12,530
Pull the stylet.

569
00:31:13,708 --> 00:31:14,697
Confirm your position.

570
00:31:14,909 --> 00:31:16,137
I'm in.

571
00:31:16,344 --> 00:31:17,811
Good job.

572
00:31:18,713 --> 00:31:20,840
Lets call Respiratory for a vent.

573
00:31:21,949 --> 00:31:23,814
I hear good breath sounds.

574
00:31:24,051 --> 00:31:25,985
- He's in SVT!
- We need to shock him.

575
00:31:26,187 --> 00:31:28,417
Not while they're attached.
Try Adenocard.

576
00:31:28,623 --> 00:31:29,612
Please save my brother.

577
00:31:30,458 --> 00:31:32,926
- Carter, let go.
- I'm stuck!

578
00:31:33,127 --> 00:31:34,560
Charging, 200!

579
00:31:34,762 --> 00:31:36,320
Get out of your gloves and gown.

580
00:31:36,531 --> 00:31:38,658
- My beard is stuck.
- Got the cutters.

581
00:31:40,735 --> 00:31:41,724
Pull back, Carter.

582
00:31:42,436 --> 00:31:43,835
I need some exposed skin!

583
00:31:50,244 --> 00:31:52,109
I'm stuck!

584
00:31:55,383 --> 00:31:56,645
Clear!

585
00:32:00,388 --> 00:32:01,480
Got a pulse!

586
00:32:01,689 --> 00:32:04,556
Good job, everybody.
Let's get him to the O.R.

587
00:32:10,932 --> 00:32:13,594
- Still want pictures?
- Might as well.

588
00:32:14,635 --> 00:32:16,227
Carter?

589
00:32:16,437 --> 00:32:17,426
Carter, you all right?

590
00:32:17,638 --> 00:32:18,764
Yeah, I think so.

591
00:32:18,973 --> 00:32:20,702
Thank you for saving my brother.

592
00:32:20,908 --> 00:32:23,934
Just doing our job.
We need to extricate Dr. Carter.

593
00:32:24,145 --> 00:32:26,773
So, Lucy, why don't you start
with his beard?

594
00:32:34,488 --> 00:32:36,217
He was juggling while on
a pogo stick?

595
00:32:36,424 --> 00:32:39,655
- Yeah, a guy in Zurich.
- What about while skydiving?

596
00:32:39,861 --> 00:32:44,059
Isabella from Tangiers holds
the record for juggling five balls.

597
00:32:44,265 --> 00:32:45,698
How long has he been at it?

598
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,559
- For over 31/2 hours.
- What's the record?

599
00:32:48,769 --> 00:32:51,237
Eleven hours, four minutes,
22 seconds.

600
00:32:51,439 --> 00:32:54,135
It's in the book.
Kate's documenting the event.

601
00:32:54,342 --> 00:32:55,934
This could be our first time on TV.

602
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,710
Less than eight hours to go.

603
00:32:59,146 --> 00:33:01,205
- Dad!
- Jerry, watch out!

604
00:33:06,187 --> 00:33:09,918
Congratulations, never thought
you'd unstick the glue brothers.

605
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:14,419
- Guess you can fix about anything?
- We try.

606
00:33:14,629 --> 00:33:17,097
I got a call.
You picked up a kid, Delaney?

607
00:33:17,298 --> 00:33:19,562
- We got a warrant for his arrest.
- What for?

608
00:33:20,301 --> 00:33:22,769
Parole violation,
prostitution, the usual.

609
00:33:23,237 --> 00:33:24,795
How long do you expect to keep him?

610
00:33:25,006 --> 00:33:27,634
Hard to say, we're treating him
for blood clotting.

611
00:33:27,842 --> 00:33:30,675
Call when you release him.
We'll pick him up.

612
00:33:30,878 --> 00:33:33,005
Yeah, I'm a doctor, I'm not a cop.

613
00:33:34,715 --> 00:33:36,080
He needs a second chance.

614
00:33:36,284 --> 00:33:38,149
I'm a cop, not a social worker.

615
00:33:38,352 --> 00:33:39,785
You do your job, I'll do mine.

616
00:33:39,987 --> 00:33:42,387
If he gets beat up in jail,
he'll bleed to death.

617
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:45,388
If I don't pick him up,
somebody else will.

618
00:33:45,593 --> 00:33:47,925
I have a sitter to guard him
until his discharge.

619
00:33:51,365 --> 00:33:52,696
Good job on the trauma.

620
00:33:58,105 --> 00:34:00,938
- You came pretty close.
- We'll try again later.

621
00:34:01,142 --> 00:34:02,507
- Hey.
- Hi.

622
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,177
Kate ready to be discharged?

623
00:34:04,378 --> 00:34:06,278
Bring her back for a cast check.

624
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,539
- No jumping around?
- Not for six weeks.

625
00:34:08,749 --> 00:34:10,944
- Thank you for being so kind.
- You're welcome.

626
00:34:11,152 --> 00:34:12,346
- Thanks.
- Okay, bye.

627
00:34:12,553 --> 00:34:14,043
I'll miss the event at the pier.

628
00:34:14,255 --> 00:34:16,348
Sorry, sweetheart.
You want to go watch?

629
00:34:16,557 --> 00:34:18,616
- I guess.
- Okay.

630
00:34:20,628 --> 00:34:22,289
Brad's bed is ready.

631
00:34:22,496 --> 00:34:26,364
I've written orders for Oncology
to continue to rehydrate him.

632
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:28,592
Thank you, Dr. Carter.

633
00:34:29,437 --> 00:34:31,701
You should feel fine in a couple days.

634
00:34:31,906 --> 00:34:34,067
- Good luck with your treatment.
- Thanks.

635
00:34:34,275 --> 00:34:36,937
- Malik, can you take him up?
- Yeah, sure.

636
00:34:37,144 --> 00:34:39,305
He isn't dehydrated, is he?

637
00:34:39,747 --> 00:34:41,237
He vomited, I gave him fluids.

638
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:42,438
What will Oncology say?

639
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:45,118
All they want is a diagnosis
for his admission.

640
00:34:45,319 --> 00:34:46,308
I gave them one.

641
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,885
Can you give him an IV?

642
00:34:48,089 --> 00:34:49,386
Was the only way to admit him.

643
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:52,081
- So you lied?
- Technically, yeah.

644
00:34:52,293 --> 00:34:53,988
Sometimes you gotta work the system.

645
00:34:54,195 --> 00:34:55,719
You lied?

646
00:34:57,498 --> 00:34:59,261
I didn't know you were there.

647
00:34:59,467 --> 00:35:01,264
Is it true Brad's not dehydrated?

648
00:35:01,469 --> 00:35:03,096
It's a way for him to get chemo.

649
00:35:03,304 --> 00:35:04,771
What if my insurance finds out?

650
00:35:04,972 --> 00:35:08,237
- I see no reason why they should.
- I do, they've challenged claims.

651
00:35:08,442 --> 00:35:10,501
If they find out,
Brad loses his coverage.

652
00:35:10,711 --> 00:35:13,441
Then what do we do
when his leukemia gets worse?

653
00:35:13,647 --> 00:35:16,241
I don't see another
way of going about doing this.

654
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:18,475
I'll talk to you later.

655
00:35:18,753 --> 00:35:20,744
Cop stopped by earlier.

656
00:35:20,955 --> 00:35:23,719
Still wants to take you in
after I discharge you.

657
00:35:23,924 --> 00:35:27,257
- What did you tell him?
- That you were sick.

658
00:35:27,461 --> 00:35:29,986
- Are they gonna put me in juvie?
- They want to.

659
00:35:30,197 --> 00:35:33,530
I can't go back there.
I'm a punching bag for those guys.

660
00:35:33,734 --> 00:35:35,031
I know.

661
00:35:35,269 --> 00:35:38,602
I gotta tell you, getting heparinized
is the best treatment.

662
00:35:38,806 --> 00:35:42,469
Great. Listen, I can't stick
around here if the cops are coming.

663
00:35:42,676 --> 00:35:43,904
Figured you'd say that.

664
00:35:52,787 --> 00:35:54,482
Are you setting me up?

665
00:36:00,828 --> 00:36:04,594
If your leg starts to hurt or gets
swollen, you have to come back.

666
00:36:05,366 --> 00:36:08,096
Here's 50 bucks and my pager number.

667
00:36:14,308 --> 00:36:17,038
Coumadin and a list of shelters.

668
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,275
I never promised you I'd take that.

669
00:36:21,482 --> 00:36:22,744
I know.

670
00:36:28,556 --> 00:36:29,853
Maybe I'll see you around?

671
00:36:49,009 --> 00:36:51,136
Hey, Peter, you missed a great trauma.

672
00:36:51,345 --> 00:36:53,813
Yeah? I was out talking to Dr. Parks.

673
00:36:54,014 --> 00:36:55,641
What did you think of her?

674
00:36:56,217 --> 00:37:00,813
She had the audacity to say Reece
should be with deaf kids more than me.

675
00:37:01,021 --> 00:37:05,014
Yeah, I should've warned you.
Lisa has very strong opinions.

676
00:37:05,226 --> 00:37:06,215
Opinions?

677
00:37:06,427 --> 00:37:10,295
Well, she doesn't mind being deaf.
She doesn't want to be cured.

678
00:37:10,498 --> 00:37:12,728
I thought you'd want
to see what she's achieved.

679
00:37:12,933 --> 00:37:15,993
I don't want my son to live
with a defect if I can help it.

680
00:37:16,203 --> 00:37:17,192
"Defect"?

681
00:37:18,739 --> 00:37:19,967
What do you mean by that?

682
00:37:21,909 --> 00:37:24,673
It means, what I do with
my son is my business.

683
00:37:27,348 --> 00:37:29,782
Be sure and let me know
how things work out.

684
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:31,576
God bless you, sweetheart.

685
00:37:31,785 --> 00:37:34,879
I thought the nursing home said
they wouldn't have a bed.

686
00:37:35,089 --> 00:37:38,718
Stan's not going there.
What you said earlier was right.

687
00:37:38,926 --> 00:37:42,020
We need to know the patient's
community. I called his temple.

688
00:37:42,229 --> 00:37:45,357
Another member with diabetes
said he'd stay with him.

689
00:37:45,866 --> 00:37:48,426
- Good idea.
- Doesn't hurt to do a little outreach.

690
00:37:48,636 --> 00:37:50,695
Mr. KIoner will be staying with you.

691
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:55,033
What's that son of a bitch doing here?

692
00:37:55,242 --> 00:37:56,607
I should have known.

693
00:37:57,578 --> 00:37:59,102
I spit on your grave!

694
00:37:59,313 --> 00:38:00,439
I'll see you dead first!

695
00:38:00,648 --> 00:38:03,173
You owe me $20,000 for
that time-share in Florida!

696
00:38:03,384 --> 00:38:04,874
It's a shack in a swamp!

697
00:38:08,489 --> 00:38:11,754
There you are. I've been looking
everywhere for you.

698
00:38:14,328 --> 00:38:15,352
I'm late for an appointment...

699
00:38:15,563 --> 00:38:17,121
What happened with Brad?

700
00:38:17,331 --> 00:38:20,425
His mom took him home.
She decided not to risk it.

701
00:38:21,468 --> 00:38:24,232
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Me too.

702
00:38:25,272 --> 00:38:28,969
I wouldn't have asked questions
if you'd told me what you were doing.

703
00:38:29,176 --> 00:38:32,475
I'm sorry that you thought
it was your business to ask me.

704
00:38:33,547 --> 00:38:35,208
What's going to happen?

705
00:38:35,716 --> 00:38:37,411
He's gonna die.

706
00:38:50,664 --> 00:38:55,260
Mark, I was putting together
a year-Iong ER coverage schedule.

707
00:38:55,469 --> 00:38:56,436
Good.

708
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:57,932
Kerry, I want to talk to you.

709
00:38:59,506 --> 00:39:01,235
Is it about the Chief position?

710
00:39:02,409 --> 00:39:05,901
The executive committee has decided
to reopen the search.

711
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:14,183
The committee feels that they need a
candidate with a national reputation.

712
00:39:14,989 --> 00:39:17,355
Personally, I think it stinks.

713
00:39:20,394 --> 00:39:23,056
Well, that's that.

714
00:39:23,364 --> 00:39:25,992
You're not out of the running, Kerry.

715
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,169
- They just reopened the search.
- No.

716
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:34,501
And I'm not interested
in continuing as Interim Chief.

717
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:37,233
- Who's gonna do it?
- Not my problem.

718
00:39:38,479 --> 00:39:41,414
I shouldn't have yelled,
but he's so damn sensitive.

719
00:39:41,615 --> 00:39:43,708
Hold still, Marcus.

720
00:39:44,385 --> 00:39:46,353
Hey, welcome back.

721
00:39:46,553 --> 00:39:48,043
I hear I missed quite a trauma.

722
00:39:48,255 --> 00:39:49,882
You certainly did.

723
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:53,355
It's all my fault.
Eddy was driving, and I upset him.

724
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,120
I was just upstairs.
They finished the surgery.

725
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:58,491
They repaired your brother's heart.

726
00:39:58,699 --> 00:40:00,690
Oh, thank God!

727
00:40:01,135 --> 00:40:04,127
It was Dr. Corday here
who freed him just in time.

728
00:40:05,272 --> 00:40:06,864
Well, that doesn't surprise me.

729
00:40:07,074 --> 00:40:09,133
She's an excellent doctor.

730
00:40:09,877 --> 00:40:12,846
When you're finished with Marcus,
we'll grab dinner.

731
00:40:13,047 --> 00:40:14,810
I beg your pardon?

732
00:40:15,015 --> 00:40:18,610
You're my new intern.
I just gave you an order.

733
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,511
Would you excuse us for a moment?

734
00:40:24,325 --> 00:40:26,418
Peter, are you sure?

735
00:40:27,661 --> 00:40:29,026
Elizabeth, you're no intern.

736
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:33,727
You'll still have to do scut work
and take call every third night.

737
00:40:33,934 --> 00:40:36,630
But you'll have your patients
and can operate.

738
00:40:37,204 --> 00:40:38,228
Thank you.

739
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:41,233
Yeah, don't mention it.

740
00:40:41,442 --> 00:40:43,706
- I'll see you later.
- Aren't you on tonight?

741
00:40:44,945 --> 00:40:46,606
Yeah, I am.

742
00:40:55,155 --> 00:40:57,851
Sure you don't want something
to eat from Doc Magoo's?

743
00:40:58,058 --> 00:41:01,550
No, that's all right.
I got indigestion there at lunch.

744
00:41:02,563 --> 00:41:04,030
What are you doing?

745
00:41:04,465 --> 00:41:06,126
I opened my big mouth.

746
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:10,269
I told Anspaugh that Pedes ER
was running at peak capacity.

747
00:41:10,471 --> 00:41:14,464
Now he wants me to give a detailed
analysis of the daily census.

748
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,771
When will you be home?

749
00:41:17,611 --> 00:41:19,272
Around April.

750
00:41:19,913 --> 00:41:21,676
I won't wait up then.

751
00:41:21,982 --> 00:41:24,212
- Good night.
- Good night.

752
00:41:27,421 --> 00:41:30,083
Hey, doc, where are you headed?

753
00:41:30,591 --> 00:41:31,922
Home, you?

754
00:41:32,126 --> 00:41:33,787
To the firehouse, we're off duty.

755
00:41:33,994 --> 00:41:37,088
Listen, sorry I broke protocol
this morning.

756
00:41:37,998 --> 00:41:39,693
The adrenaline got the best of me.

757
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,697
Happens to me in a couple of hours.

758
00:41:41,902 --> 00:41:42,994
My knees won't stop shaking.

759
00:41:44,138 --> 00:41:46,834
- You got any cash on you?
- I'm tapped out.

760
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,406
Bunch of us are playing poker.
Want to come?

761
00:41:49,943 --> 00:41:52,741
- Sure.
- We'll stop by the Ready Teller.

762
00:41:52,946 --> 00:41:54,743
- Hop in.
- All right.

763
00:42:04,758 --> 00:42:06,316
What time do we have to beat?

764
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,150
Six hours and 29 minutes.

765
00:42:08,362 --> 00:42:10,296
We're trying to set
a new world record.

766
00:42:10,497 --> 00:42:11,521
You're doing great.

767
00:42:11,732 --> 00:42:13,996
- Thanks for stepping in for Katie.
- My pleasure.

768
00:42:14,201 --> 00:42:17,136
Only six hours,
24 minutes to go, right?

769
00:42:32,352 --> 00:42:34,547
- Dr. Weaver.
- Carter?

770
00:42:35,823 --> 00:42:38,291
What are you doing here?

771
00:42:40,093 --> 00:42:43,995
I came to see about a room for rent.
Is this the right address?

772
00:42:45,799 --> 00:42:49,394
It is, I rent out my apartment.

773
00:42:49,603 --> 00:42:51,298
I have a basement.

774
00:42:53,874 --> 00:42:55,068
Would you like to see it?

775
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:57,899
Sure.

776
00:42:58,712 --> 00:43:01,306
I don't usually advertise
at the hospital.

777
00:43:01,515 --> 00:43:05,815
I always thought it might be
kind of, you know, awkward.

778
00:43:07,588 --> 00:43:09,522
Sure, well, if you'd rather not.

779
00:43:10,257 --> 00:43:11,189
No.

780
00:43:13,427 --> 00:43:15,691
I was just having a drink.

781
00:43:17,998 --> 00:43:18,987
Would you like one?

782
00:43:22,035 --> 00:43:24,833
- Sure.
- Good, good.

783
00:43:31,378 --> 00:43:34,108
Did you do something to your hair?

784
00:43:38,485 --> 00:43:39,884
Hello?

785
00:43:40,921 --> 00:43:42,354
Hey, baby.

786
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:45,681
Your census report?

787
00:43:45,893 --> 00:43:48,726
Yeah, I think it's
on the kitchen table.

788
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:51,297
You want me to get it for you?

789
00:43:51,498 --> 00:43:55,434
No, I can do it. It's just gonna
take a minute, okay? Just hold on.

790
00:43:55,636 --> 00:43:58,833
Don't get out of the tub.
You look all happy.

791
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:02,372
Doug, what are you doing here?

792
00:44:02,743 --> 00:44:05,371
I came to get this,
but then I was thinking...

793
00:44:05,979 --> 00:44:09,210
...that I was working
all night last night.

794
00:44:09,416 --> 00:44:10,474
You were.

795
00:44:11,051 --> 00:44:14,714
- And I'll be working all day tomorrow.
- Yeah.

796
00:44:14,922 --> 00:44:17,686
- Maybe I should take tonight off.
- That's a good idea.

797
00:44:17,891 --> 00:44:19,449
You like that?

798
00:44:23,864 --> 00:44:26,662
- What's that, a bubble bath?
- You want to come in?
