2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,866
<i>Previously on ER</i>

3
00:00:05,967 --> 00:00:08,246
I understand you want
to define yourself as chief.

4
00:00:08,347 --> 00:00:09,025
But?

5
00:00:09,026 --> 00:00:10,960
Are you sure that this is
the way you want to do it?

6
00:00:11,061 --> 00:00:12,323
I suck.

7
00:00:12,424 --> 00:00:16,149
No, you don't suck.
You're still learning.

8
00:00:17,327 --> 00:00:18,135
So how are you doing?

9
00:00:18,136 --> 00:00:21,653
I processed feelings of anger, shame and
guilt in an emotionally safe environment.

10
00:00:21,754 --> 00:00:23,742
I've addressed the urge to use alcohol.

11
00:00:23,843 --> 00:00:26,465
And I've consulted both a shaman
and a guru, so I'm all good.

12
00:00:26,566 --> 00:00:30,330
I must've made an impression on you.
You didn't notice I was gone for a week.

14
00:00:30,749 --> 00:00:32,734
Are you high?

15
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:42,416
Alex, hurry up!
The bus is gonna be here!

16
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:45,668
- What time do you start?
- Noon.

17
00:00:45,835 --> 00:00:47,879
Is Neela on today?

18
00:00:48,003 --> 00:00:51,672
- Is Neela on?
- I don't know. I think she is.

19
00:00:51,839 --> 00:00:54,384
It's funny how that keeps working out.

20
00:00:54,883 --> 00:00:56,718
- What?
- Nothing.

21
00:00:56,885 --> 00:01:01,638
Come on. She's young, single, lonely.
She's got a crush on you.

22
00:01:02,138 --> 00:01:04,099
I'm her teacher.
She's just trying to learn.

23
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:05,974
Yeah, bet she is.

24
00:01:06,141 --> 00:01:08,267
- Come on.
- What? Everyone can see it.

25
00:01:08,434 --> 00:01:11,686
- Who's everyone?
- Pratt, Frank...

26
00:01:11,853 --> 00:01:14,814
...Jerry, Morris, Chuny, Haleh.

27
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,357
Even Murray.

28
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,859
- Murray?
- That guy who works at the roach coach.

29
00:01:20,527 --> 00:01:23,986
It's not funny, Luka.
You're doing everything to encourage it.

30
00:01:24,654 --> 00:01:27,656
- That's not true.
- Yeah? Well, it better not be.

31
00:01:27,864 --> 00:01:31,534
Or else I might have to get
into some nasty chick fight with Neela.

32
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,785
In the mud? Just don't hurt her.

33
00:01:34,869 --> 00:01:40,665
The only person who's going to get hurt
around here is you. You got it?

34
00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:44,042
Yeah, I think it was April.

35
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:47,628
But the fact that I need a calendar
to figure it out is not a good sign.

36
00:01:47,795 --> 00:01:50,505
- Did I meet him?
- No.

37
00:01:50,672 --> 00:01:52,966
He drove a motorcycle.

38
00:01:53,298 --> 00:01:56,301
- That was his defining characteristic?
- I'm afraid so.

39
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:58,386
- What about you?
- Third year.

40
00:01:58,594 --> 00:02:01,471
My gross anatomy instructor.

41
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,140
He was very skilled at prosecting
the brachial plexus.

42
00:02:04,348 --> 00:02:05,850
You slept with your instructor?

43
00:02:06,766 --> 00:02:09,601
Dr. Gibson had a very tender way
with cadavers.

44
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,478
And you called him Dr. Gibson?

45
00:02:11,645 --> 00:02:13,312
Only in bed.

46
00:02:14,188 --> 00:02:17,899
So basically, neither one of us has
gotten any in a ridiculously long time.

47
00:02:19,191 --> 00:02:21,902
Well, at least we have work
to keep our minds off...

48
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:25,196
...men, romance, sex.

49
00:02:25,363 --> 00:02:28,240
- Yeah, at least we have that.
- Morning.

50
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:32,784
- Hello, Luka.
- Dr. Kovac.

51
00:02:32,951 --> 00:02:35,828
Multiple MVA on their way in.

52
00:02:35,953 --> 00:02:40,456
Patient-satisfaction scores were up
0.6 points from two weeks ago.

53
00:02:40,623 --> 00:02:43,166
- Is that good?
- Yeah, it's good. Very good.

54
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:46,752
I'm gonna post it.
Carter, I wanna thank you.

55
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:49,880
I know that my taking over as chief
has been stressful.

56
00:02:50,046 --> 00:02:51,631
It's been a little weird for you...

57
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:55,174
...but you've made the transition
a lot easier, and I appreciate it.

58
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,510
Susan, I can't think of anybody
I'd rather have as a boss than you.

59
00:02:59,553 --> 00:03:02,513
Sixteen-year-old driver backed
into a utility pole.

60
00:03:02,722 --> 00:03:05,265
Okay, hop to it.
And don't call me Susan at work.

61
00:03:05,432 --> 00:03:06,975
What happened?

62
00:03:07,142 --> 00:03:10,894
- Dad was teaching her to parallel park.
- She just got her learner's permit.

63
00:03:11,061 --> 00:03:15,063
I got a little bit dizzy,
and maybe I got the pedals mixed up.

64
00:03:16,732 --> 00:03:18,107
New scores?

65
00:03:18,274 --> 00:03:22,027
Yep, we don't suck as bad as we used
to. Maybe by next week, we'll suck less.

66
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:25,696
- Must be your motivational speeches.
- We're pairing Attendings with interns.

67
00:03:25,863 --> 00:03:28,031
- Abby, you got me. Neela, you got Kovac.
- What?

68
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,033
Big Croatian guy. You can't miss him.

69
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:33,869
We've got a double MVC rolling in.
Abby, he's all yours today.

70
00:03:34,036 --> 00:03:35,786
- Who?
- Hey.

71
00:03:35,953 --> 00:03:37,829
You guys know each other, right?

72
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,876
Hi.

73
00:03:45,043 --> 00:03:47,419
You know how to clear
a C-spine clinically?

74
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:49,087
You mean, if it's not tender?

75
00:03:49,254 --> 00:03:52,298
That's a no. Check the NEXUS criteria.
Get back to me tomorrow.

76
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:54,716
I give you Rodney Dixon
and Amanda Field.

77
00:03:54,883 --> 00:03:57,176
Rear-ended by a truck
while having sex in his car.

78
00:03:57,343 --> 00:03:58,802
- Good vitals on both.
- I'd say.

79
00:03:58,969 --> 00:04:02,388
- Are they stuck together with super-glue?
- We tried to disengage them but-

80
00:04:02,555 --> 00:04:05,515
- Oh, it's killing me, man.
- Broken pelvis plus lust equals-

81
00:04:05,682 --> 00:04:07,892
Oh, God!

82
00:04:59,719 --> 00:05:02,429
- Chest is clear, belly's benign.
- Back seat of a car, huh?

83
00:05:02,596 --> 00:05:05,473
'66 Mustang fastback.
I hope it's not totaled.

84
00:05:05,598 --> 00:05:09,101
- Fastback? That's a pretty tight squeeze.
- I do Pilates.

85
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,353
It's got a 389-1 rear gear
with a 31 spline axle.

86
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,939
- Nice.
- You were screwing in an old Ford?

87
00:05:15,105 --> 00:05:17,398
What were we supposed to do?
My husband was home.

88
00:05:17,565 --> 00:05:20,150
- Oh, God.
- Probably a small crack in the pelvis.

89
00:05:20,317 --> 00:05:21,734
You've got this, right?

90
00:05:21,901 --> 00:05:23,653
Oh, I'm all over it.

91
00:05:24,362 --> 00:05:27,155
We'll give you morphine
and wait for your Viagra to wear off.

92
00:05:28,114 --> 00:05:30,074
Dr. Lewis told me
to present to you today.

93
00:05:31,825 --> 00:05:33,785
- She did?
- Something about interns...

94
00:05:33,952 --> 00:05:35,327
...having a primary Attending.

95
00:05:37,371 --> 00:05:38,830
- Okay.
- I hope you'll show me...

96
00:05:38,996 --> 00:05:41,498
...that combat procedure
you mentioned last shift.

97
00:05:41,665 --> 00:05:43,291
The femoral tear.

98
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,668
Oh, it depends on whether
we get a patient...

99
00:05:45,835 --> 00:05:49,128
- ...who needs emergent central access.
- Well, whenever we do.

100
00:05:50,755 --> 00:05:52,130
Sorry.

101
00:05:55,341 --> 00:05:59,261
- Infected anal fissure in the hallway.
- Okay.

102
00:06:02,972 --> 00:06:05,932
- Pupils, four millimeters and reactive.
- Ten centimeters JVD.

103
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,975
My wife is not gonna be happy.

104
00:06:08,141 --> 00:06:09,977
It's okay, Dad. It was my idea.

105
00:06:10,143 --> 00:06:12,270
I take it Mom wasn't aware
of the lessons.

106
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:14,938
If she had it her way,
I would never be allowed out.

107
00:06:15,105 --> 00:06:18,399
We're kind of separated for now.
Katie was with me this week.

108
00:06:18,607 --> 00:06:20,900
Does she take any medications?

109
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:23,986
Prednisone, tacrolimus...

110
00:06:24,152 --> 00:06:26,862
- The anti-rejection drug?
- She had a kidney transplant.

111
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:28,864
I have polycystic kidney disease.

112
00:06:29,031 --> 00:06:31,866
We were on the UNOS list
for seven years waiting for a donor.

113
00:06:32,033 --> 00:06:33,826
Yeah, I'm a big fan of dialysis.

114
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:35,327
She's got blood type O...

115
00:06:35,494 --> 00:06:38,037
...with an 80 percent
reactive antibody panel.

116
00:06:38,204 --> 00:06:40,163
- Tough match.
- Yeah, well...

117
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:43,124
...finally got big enough
that I could give her one of mine.

118
00:06:43,249 --> 00:06:44,500
Your kidney?

119
00:06:44,667 --> 00:06:46,543
What a dad, huh?

120
00:06:47,085 --> 00:06:49,337
Any other meds?

121
00:06:49,503 --> 00:06:51,839
Yeah, she's on an anti-seizure drug too.

122
00:06:52,006 --> 00:06:53,673
The PKD gave her an aneurysm.

123
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,258
Mom's on the way, sweetie.

124
00:06:55,425 --> 00:06:57,384
Thanks.

125
00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:00,511
Okay. A few crackles at the base.

126
00:07:01,596 --> 00:07:03,555
Bradycardic at 48.

127
00:07:03,722 --> 00:07:05,682
Peak T waves, widened QRS.

128
00:07:08,058 --> 00:07:11,185
All right, amp of bicarb,
10 cc's of calcium gluconate.

129
00:07:11,352 --> 00:07:13,145
What do you think is going on?

130
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:17,982
Well, low heart rate,
dizziness and EKG changes.

131
00:07:18,149 --> 00:07:19,858
Could be hyperkalemia.

132
00:07:20,025 --> 00:07:21,234
What?

133
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,736
- No, no, that can't be.
- Hey, John.

134
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,029
Since the transplant,
her kidney has been fine.

135
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,239
Why don't we see
what the blood tests show...

136
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:31,158
...then we'll take it from there.
Excuse me for one second.

137
00:07:32,908 --> 00:07:35,076
- Do you have an intern on this?
- I got Ray.

138
00:07:36,202 --> 00:07:39,371
- What do you think about taking Neela?
- Why? Is there a problem?

139
00:07:39,538 --> 00:07:41,206
Just do me a favor, okay?

140
00:07:41,332 --> 00:07:43,916
All right, send the Punjabi Powerhouse
my way.

141
00:07:44,334 --> 00:07:46,752
Painless jaundice in 3
and ulnar styloid fracture.

142
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:48,627
I'll take those.

143
00:07:49,378 --> 00:07:51,546
There was a change.
You're with Carter today.

144
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:55,341
- I thought I was with you.
- No, he needs you in Trauma 1.

145
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,386
Isolated pubic ramus fracture.

146
00:08:01,636 --> 00:08:03,472
Will I be, you know, all right?

147
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,015
No cast, no surgery.
Just rest and pain meds.

148
00:08:06,182 --> 00:08:09,601
But you're gonna have to be careful
for a couple of weeks until it heals.

149
00:08:09,809 --> 00:08:12,895
- Careful?
- Yes, as in abstinent.

150
00:08:13,437 --> 00:08:15,521
The safest sex of all.

151
00:08:16,064 --> 00:08:18,940
- Abstinent? Are you serious?
- Can't put any pressure on your pelvis...

152
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:21,901
...or you'll end up back here.
Not what we want.

153
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,861
- It's the pelvis we should worry about?
- That's right.

154
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,696
But other positions?

155
00:08:26,863 --> 00:08:28,072
Yeah, sure.

156
00:08:28,238 --> 00:08:31,657
Get yourself a six-pack,
the Kamasutra, and shoot out the lights.

157
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:34,117
Did we do something to offend her?

158
00:08:34,326 --> 00:08:37,161
Pulse is up to 61. BP's stable.

159
00:08:37,369 --> 00:08:39,663
Looks like the QRS complexes
are narrowing.

160
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,081
- That's good.
- That is good.

161
00:08:41,247 --> 00:08:43,749
The chemistry machine is down.
Should be up in an hour.

162
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:47,627
- You can't say if it's a kidney problem?
- The urine dip shows four-plus protein.

163
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:51,296
- We won't know until the labs come back.
- I told them to hurry.

164
00:08:51,546 --> 00:08:54,006
- Honey, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine, Mom.

165
00:08:54,173 --> 00:08:55,883
- Sweetie-
- It was nothing.

166
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,051
I told you it was too soon
for her to drive.

167
00:08:58,218 --> 00:09:00,594
- What were you thinking?
- She's 16. She wants a permit.

168
00:09:00,803 --> 00:09:02,095
You never know when to stop.

169
00:09:02,262 --> 00:09:03,679
- Let's not do this here.
- Please.

170
00:09:03,888 --> 00:09:06,723
I need more of Katie's family history.
Could we step outside...

171
00:09:06,932 --> 00:09:09,100
...and give Katie a chance to rest?

172
00:09:09,433 --> 00:09:12,102
I'll be back, okay, sweetie?

173
00:09:16,396 --> 00:09:21,192
I've been sick for so long,
it just got to be too much for them.

174
00:09:21,359 --> 00:09:23,944
She was on Dilantin
for a long time...

175
00:09:24,277 --> 00:09:26,946
...but she didn't like it.
It changed the way she looked.

176
00:09:27,112 --> 00:09:29,781
- She was still having these seizures-
- It was manageable.

177
00:09:29,948 --> 00:09:33,200
No, honey. She had them at school,
in the movies.

178
00:09:33,408 --> 00:09:36,619
- She hated it.
- So you switched her medication?

179
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:40,288
- Three months ago we put her on Zarictal.
- It was not my choice.

180
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,122
- Zarictal?
- It's new.

181
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:45,084
And we can't afford it.
Medicare does not cover it.

182
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,336
I took a second job working night
security at the Mallers Building.

183
00:09:48,502 --> 00:09:51,129
- We lost our apartment.
- She's been doing great.

184
00:09:51,296 --> 00:09:53,589
Katie has been seizure-free
for three months.

185
00:09:54,131 --> 00:09:55,340
- No infections?
- No.

186
00:09:55,507 --> 00:09:57,968
No febrile illnesses?

187
00:09:58,134 --> 00:10:00,636
Have they switched her dosage
of Zarictal?

188
00:10:00,803 --> 00:10:03,596
- Everything's been steady.
- But she was doing fine before.

189
00:10:03,763 --> 00:10:06,306
- I don't know why-
- She wanted to drive.

190
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:08,224
Like other kids.

191
00:10:08,391 --> 00:10:11,434
- With seizures, she couldn't get a license.
- We almost lost her...

192
00:10:11,601 --> 00:10:14,437
...and you're worried about her
being able to drive?

193
00:10:17,606 --> 00:10:21,900
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Look, I don't want to fight, okay?

194
00:10:22,109 --> 00:10:25,695
I think it's time that we accept the fact
she will never be totally healthy-

195
00:10:25,861 --> 00:10:27,071
- Why?
- That's reality!

196
00:10:27,238 --> 00:10:29,531
Not for me.

197
00:10:30,448 --> 00:10:32,032
I...

198
00:10:35,076 --> 00:10:36,286
You have a neurologist?

199
00:10:37,287 --> 00:10:40,372
- Yeah, he's been great.
- Good. Why don't we give him a call.

200
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:43,541
I'd like to talk to him
about the medications.

201
00:10:46,376 --> 00:10:49,628
- Sounds like a hard situation.
- Look up this new drug for me.

202
00:10:49,837 --> 00:10:53,214
I had a patient on that last year
during my internal medicine rotation.

203
00:10:53,381 --> 00:10:54,881
Really? Never heard of it before.

204
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:58,175
It's pretty new. Expensive,
but very effective for seizure control.

205
00:10:58,342 --> 00:11:00,635
You kids and your fancy book learning.

206
00:11:00,802 --> 00:11:03,637
- Yeah, well, I try to keep up.
- Do a PDR and check a Medline.

207
00:11:03,804 --> 00:11:06,515
See if there's renal dysfunction
associated with the drug.

208
00:11:06,681 --> 00:11:08,057
Okay.

209
00:11:09,058 --> 00:11:10,934
- Hi.
- Hi.

210
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,686
This is George Guidry.

211
00:11:13,853 --> 00:11:17,647
He's got a skin breakdown
around the shaft of his penis.

212
00:11:18,315 --> 00:11:21,608
- No, he doesn't.
- I think I do.

213
00:11:22,151 --> 00:11:24,152
- Any discharge?
- Oh, yeah. Definitely.

214
00:11:24,319 --> 00:11:27,362
- I'm not talking about that.
- No discharge, no fever, no blisters.

215
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:29,239
Do you use a condom?

216
00:11:29,406 --> 00:11:31,615
Not since my girlfriend
broke up with me.

217
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:34,200
No vesicles, no chancre,
no lymphadenopathy.

218
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:36,326
Okay.

219
00:11:36,493 --> 00:11:38,495
- Let's take a gander.
- Yeah.

220
00:11:39,204 --> 00:11:43,373
You know, I just thought of something.
Could this be from too much...?

221
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,000
You know...

222
00:11:47,543 --> 00:11:48,961
Too much what?

223
00:11:51,004 --> 00:11:54,673
Since Lily left, I've been lonely,
you know?

224
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,549
Really...

225
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,718
...really lonely.

226
00:11:59,634 --> 00:12:00,844
How lonely?

227
00:12:02,094 --> 00:12:05,513
Six, sometimes seven times a day.

228
00:12:11,934 --> 00:12:14,312
I found a report
in the Western Journal of Medicine.

229
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,898
It suggests a correlation
between renal failure and Zarictal.

230
00:12:19,064 --> 00:12:22,358
- Well, that ain't much.
- No, but these might be.

231
00:12:22,525 --> 00:12:26,153
From the adverse drug coordinator
from the Department of Health Services.

232
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:28,529
Three possible cases
they've forwarded to the FDA.

233
00:12:28,696 --> 00:12:30,740
Four? That could be a pattern.

234
00:12:30,948 --> 00:12:34,451
The Physician Relations number
at Keating-Ward Pharmaceuticals.

235
00:12:34,617 --> 00:12:38,828
They make Zarictal.
Might as well see what they can tell us.

236
00:12:39,412 --> 00:12:41,705
- Yes.
- Keating-Ward Pharmaceuticals.

237
00:12:41,872 --> 00:12:44,916
This is John Carter. I'm a physician
at County General in Chicago.

238
00:12:45,124 --> 00:12:48,376
- How are you today, doctor?
- Very well. I have a 16-year-old girl.

239
00:12:48,543 --> 00:12:51,921
Status: post-renal transplant
who's been on Zarictal for three months.

240
00:12:52,087 --> 00:12:53,422
You say that's three months?

241
00:12:53,589 --> 00:12:57,342
Could I talk to somebody
about the incidence of renal failure?

242
00:12:57,508 --> 00:12:59,927
- Hold.
- Yes, I will hold.

243
00:13:01,594 --> 00:13:04,012
Does anybody even listen to that music?
It's terrible.

244
00:13:04,179 --> 00:13:06,306
Carter, QRS is widening on our PKD girl.

245
00:13:06,515 --> 00:13:08,891
- Lots of ectopy.
- I'll hold.

246
00:13:11,809 --> 00:13:15,938
- Multifocal PVCs, runs of six.
- Push 80 of lidocaine, and mix up a drip.

247
00:13:16,104 --> 00:13:18,773
- What's going on?
- It's possible the elevated potassium...

248
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,190
...is irritating Katie's heart.

249
00:13:20,357 --> 00:13:23,734
BUN, 98. Creatinine, 12.3.
Potassium, 7.2.

250
00:13:23,943 --> 00:13:25,945
Most likely she might be
in kidney failure.

251
00:13:26,111 --> 00:13:27,570
V- fib. Starting compressions.

252
00:13:27,737 --> 00:13:29,155
Charge the paddles to 200.

253
00:13:29,322 --> 00:13:31,865
- It's going to be okay. It's okay.
- And everybody clear.

254
00:13:32,074 --> 00:13:33,241
Clear.

255
00:13:37,911 --> 00:13:40,788
- Procainamide's onboard.
- And clear.

256
00:13:41,872 --> 00:13:43,081
- Sinus.
- There we go.

257
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:46,042
Set up for a femoral Quinton.
Call Dialysis for renal orders.

258
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:47,709
Katie, honey? Katie, honey?

259
00:13:47,834 --> 00:13:50,419
- That's it.
- Yeah, she's responding.

260
00:13:50,586 --> 00:13:53,213
- O2 on 15 liters.
- Are you sure she needs dialysis?

261
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:56,340
It's the best way to remove
the excess potassium from her system.

262
00:13:56,549 --> 00:14:00,802
- She has to have another transplant?
- That is a distinct possibility, yes.

263
00:14:00,969 --> 00:14:02,761
- Oh, no.
- Okay, Betadine the area.

264
00:14:02,928 --> 00:14:05,888
- They said they'd be in contact in a week.
- And one percent lido.

265
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:08,057
- A week?
- That's the standard procedure.

266
00:14:08,224 --> 00:14:10,183
- What's that?
- We telephoned the company...

267
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,935
...that makes Katie's medication.

268
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:14,311
So is it the drug?
Is that why this is happening?

269
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:18,022
The timing of the med switch
makes me think that is a possibility, yes.

270
00:14:18,231 --> 00:14:20,899
But her kidney is being damaged
by the Zarictal, is that-?

271
00:14:21,108 --> 00:14:24,110
Gabriel, Hannah,
I came as soon as I heard.

272
00:14:24,277 --> 00:14:26,152
- Was she in status?
- No, it's her kidney.

273
00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:28,446
This is Katie's neurologist, George Henry.

274
00:14:30,239 --> 00:14:32,490
Dr. Carter, I don't know
if you remember me-

275
00:14:32,657 --> 00:14:35,117
Yeah, how are you, Henry?
What has it been, six years?

276
00:14:35,325 --> 00:14:36,743
Give or take.

277
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,912
Can you take them to the family room?
I'll be right in to see you.

278
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,914
Oh, okay. Yeah, that's fine.
I think I remember the way.

279
00:14:43,081 --> 00:14:45,082
Come on. It's all right.

280
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:51,045
I gave pleasure boy some Neosporin, a
therapist's number, and sent him packing.

281
00:14:51,212 --> 00:14:55,131
- Well done.
- How about you? Is everything all right?

282
00:14:55,923 --> 00:14:58,425
Yes, I'm fine. Busy. Why?

283
00:14:58,591 --> 00:15:01,176
Well, last week when I ran into you
on the El platform...

284
00:15:01,343 --> 00:15:03,429
...I didn't realize your situation.

285
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:05,596
My situation?

286
00:15:05,763 --> 00:15:07,931
It's just that I...

287
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,684
I heard what you went through. I
didn't want you to think I was insensitive.

288
00:15:11,851 --> 00:15:15,478
No, I was happy
not to have to talk about it actually.

289
00:15:16,438 --> 00:15:18,313
Okay. Guess I'm blowing that now.

290
00:15:18,897 --> 00:15:20,607
I just...

291
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:24,359
I wanna make sure that
there isn't anything that I can do.

292
00:15:24,735 --> 00:15:26,945
Well, that's- That's nice.

293
00:15:27,486 --> 00:15:29,447
It is. Thank you. It's...

294
00:15:29,613 --> 00:15:33,116
I- Here's an H & P, and get back to me.

295
00:15:33,283 --> 00:15:34,700
Right.

296
00:15:36,493 --> 00:15:37,994
Why did you put me
with this guy?

297
00:15:38,161 --> 00:15:40,037
When did everyone become
schedule divas?

298
00:15:40,203 --> 00:15:43,789
I don't need a med student. I don't
like them, and I'm better flying solo.

299
00:15:43,956 --> 00:15:47,292
- Is there something wrong with him?
- No, he's excellent. He's very good.

300
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:49,753
- He's excellent. I just-
- Oh, no. You like him?

301
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:53,088
- You know what, forget it.
- Yes, you do! You do! You're blushing.

302
00:15:53,254 --> 00:15:55,131
We never had this conversation.

303
00:15:55,298 --> 00:15:58,216
Hey, haven't you had enough of doctors?

304
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:02,887
Put a message on the neurology and renal
newsgroups, see if there's anything...

305
00:16:03,094 --> 00:16:06,263
- ...on the drug's renal toxicity.
- That could cause a bit of a stir.

306
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,849
Yeah. All right...

307
00:16:09,016 --> 00:16:12,560
...just ask for any information that might
help us best determine treatment.

308
00:16:12,727 --> 00:16:15,312
- You heard what he said.
- I don't believe it's the drug.

309
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:19,314
- I think that there are other options.
- We have a dialysis tech coming down.

310
00:16:19,481 --> 00:16:22,108
I called UNOS.
They're gonna put Katie on the list.

311
00:16:22,275 --> 00:16:25,860
John, that may be premature.
Why don't we do a biopsy.

312
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:30,238
This may be a case of rejection, not
failure, and a biopsy would show us that.

313
00:16:30,822 --> 00:16:32,073
What's the difference?

314
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,617
Well, a drug-induced failure
would require a transplant.

315
00:16:35,783 --> 00:16:37,452
But...

316
00:16:38,161 --> 00:16:39,828
...rejection...

317
00:16:41,163 --> 00:16:44,957
Rejection could be reversed
with immunosuppressive agents.

318
00:16:47,834 --> 00:16:50,336
Well, let's do the biopsy.

319
00:16:50,669 --> 00:16:53,171
Okay, I'll put that in motion.

320
00:16:53,338 --> 00:16:56,256
Dr. Henry, can I have a word with you
outside, please?

321
00:16:56,465 --> 00:16:58,466
Excuse me one second.

322
00:17:02,844 --> 00:17:05,513
My intern's been doing research.
She's found four cases...

323
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,724
- ...of renal failure in patients on Zarictal.
- Well, that doesn't prove causation.

324
00:17:10,016 --> 00:17:11,350
It gets you going that way.

325
00:17:11,517 --> 00:17:15,019
Keating-Ward sponsored
a series of phase-three clinical trials.

326
00:17:15,186 --> 00:17:18,855
If there was any real risk, the FDA
would never have approved the drug.

327
00:17:19,231 --> 00:17:21,148
What, you never heard of Vioxx
or Rezulin?

328
00:17:21,315 --> 00:17:23,275
This is a successful
anti-seizure medicine.

329
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:26,110
It has improved Katie's
quality of life dramatically.

330
00:17:26,277 --> 00:17:27,694
Dr. Carter, dialysis is here.

331
00:17:27,861 --> 00:17:29,863
Page Dubenko to come down
for the biopsy?

332
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:32,740
Sure. These need your signature.

333
00:17:33,699 --> 00:17:35,867
- Well, I hope you're right.
- Let's be certain.

334
00:17:36,034 --> 00:17:38,577
I was really surprised
to find you still working here.

335
00:17:38,786 --> 00:17:40,662
- Why is that?
- I don't know.

336
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:44,122
I just guess I thought you
would've moved on by now.

337
00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:46,750
I guess I'm just a masochist that way.

338
00:17:46,917 --> 00:17:50,669
How about you? I thought you wanted
to go do bench research.

339
00:17:50,835 --> 00:17:53,754
- Yeah, well, I got tired of it.
- You were good at it.

340
00:17:53,921 --> 00:17:56,757
Well, I've got a wife
and two small children now.

341
00:17:56,924 --> 00:17:58,216
It changes one's priorities.

342
00:17:59,259 --> 00:18:00,717
You mean, money?

343
00:18:01,385 --> 00:18:04,971
My practice does offer me three times
the salary of an academic position.

344
00:18:06,721 --> 00:18:08,515
Well, what about you, huh?

345
00:18:08,682 --> 00:18:11,100
Married? Children?

346
00:18:11,267 --> 00:18:12,559
Not yet.

347
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,353
Thanks.

348
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,356
I'll find you when the surgeon
comes down.

349
00:18:28,529 --> 00:18:30,446
Are you moonlighting
as a word processor?

350
00:18:30,613 --> 00:18:33,573
Our PKD girl's on a new drug
we're trying to get information on.

351
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,367
- Hey, Sam.
- Hey, Dr. Lewis.

352
00:18:35,534 --> 00:18:39,619
- Morning.
- Hi. Has anyone seen-?

353
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:42,330
Is that your coffee?

354
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,248
Sorry.

355
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,499
It's a schedule, not a cocktail napkin.

356
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,876
GCS, 12. BP, 60 palp. Brady at 52.

357
00:18:49,042 --> 00:18:51,003
- Fell from the roof?
- Taking down lights.

358
00:18:51,169 --> 00:18:53,337
- He's going to need central access.
- Need help?

359
00:18:53,504 --> 00:18:55,256
- Come on down.
- Carter doesn't need you?

360
00:18:55,464 --> 00:18:57,090
Not at the moment, no.

361
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,842
Okay, prime the rapid infuser.

362
00:19:00,009 --> 00:19:02,260
- Can't find a vein.
- Pressure's only 50.

363
00:19:02,427 --> 00:19:04,429
- Heart rate's 42.
- Blood in the belly.

364
00:19:04,637 --> 00:19:06,388
He needs access. He's about to arrest.

365
00:19:06,596 --> 00:19:09,932
- Set up for a saphenous cutdown.
- Wouldn't a femoral be easier to find?

366
00:19:10,099 --> 00:19:11,767
And faster.

367
00:19:11,933 --> 00:19:14,853
Probably the same difference.
But, okay, femoral tear.

368
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:16,478
Cool, I've never done one.

369
00:19:16,645 --> 00:19:18,646
You'll do the next one. Scalpel to Neela.

370
00:19:18,855 --> 00:19:20,481
What? She's along for the ride.

371
00:19:20,648 --> 00:19:22,691
- I promised her.
- You promised her?

372
00:19:23,817 --> 00:19:26,610
Ten centimeters, vertical flash.

373
00:19:27,403 --> 00:19:29,362
- Starting here?
- Deep into the sub-Q.

374
00:19:29,529 --> 00:19:31,739
Level one is primed.

375
00:19:32,156 --> 00:19:36,242
Okay, and now you tear...

376
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:38,702
Got any sterile surgical markers?

377
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,412
There's the femoral vein.

378
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,913
Cannulate it with the 9 French.

379
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,375
- Let me try.
- No, I'll get it.

380
00:19:48,542 --> 00:19:50,127
Just reach under.

381
00:19:55,255 --> 00:19:57,423
Neela, focus on the field.

382
00:19:57,631 --> 00:19:59,425
Seldinger technique.
You know what to do.

383
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:01,176
Two units ready to go.

384
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:05,721
Sam, can you ask Dubenko
to come here when he's done?

385
00:20:05,888 --> 00:20:08,598
Yes, sir, Dr. Kovac.

386
00:20:12,434 --> 00:20:14,393
That's the lower lobe
of the kidney there.

387
00:20:14,518 --> 00:20:16,270
- Mark the depth.
- Purple okay?

388
00:20:16,437 --> 00:20:18,480
- That's my favorite color.
- Me too.

389
00:20:18,646 --> 00:20:21,315
- Three centimeters.
- They need you next door.

390
00:20:21,482 --> 00:20:22,691
What is this gonna do?

391
00:20:22,858 --> 00:20:26,402
It'll tell us if your body is rejecting
the kidney. Lidocaine.

392
00:20:26,569 --> 00:20:31,405
- That's a good thing, honey.
- All right, hold still. Little pinprick here.

393
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:34,532
There you go.

394
00:20:34,699 --> 00:20:37,993
It's going to be, like, 20-something
before I can get another one.

395
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,620
- No, that's not going to happen.
- Biopsy gun.

396
00:20:40,786 --> 00:20:44,706
You just need to tell your immune
system to stop being so picky.

397
00:20:50,084 --> 00:20:51,669
Firing.

398
00:20:51,836 --> 00:20:53,212
Dr. Carter.

399
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:54,671
Dr. Weaver's on the phone.

400
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:57,673
- She sounds kind of...
- Kind of what?

401
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,593
- Weaver-like.
- I'll call her back.

402
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,221
Purple, huh? I've always been partial
to azure myself.

403
00:21:05,387 --> 00:21:08,139
- What's azure?
- Like your eyes.

404
00:21:08,806 --> 00:21:12,142
Send that off for light microscopy,
EM and IF staining.

405
00:21:15,727 --> 00:21:17,479
Pack the wound with a moist gauze.

406
00:21:17,646 --> 00:21:20,397
- What do we have here?
- Belly bleed needs a post-op head CT.

407
00:21:20,564 --> 00:21:22,690
- We have FFP thawing.
- Send it upstairs.

408
00:21:22,857 --> 00:21:26,401
Pressure's up to 100 systolic.
Heart rate's 90.

409
00:21:29,278 --> 00:21:31,656
Dr. Kovac, I...

410
00:21:32,614 --> 00:21:35,324
I never knew it was possible
to transfuse that fast.

411
00:21:35,532 --> 00:21:38,118
Well, that's the beauty
of the central venous cutdown.

412
00:21:38,285 --> 00:21:40,203
Now you know how to do it.

413
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:46,248
- What made you recommend Zarictal?
- A luncheon at Northwestern.

414
00:21:46,415 --> 00:21:48,667
I heard a neurologist present
on its efficacies.

415
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,336
A neurologist who's
a paid consultant of Keating-Ward.

416
00:21:51,502 --> 00:21:53,504
- So what? It stopped-
- George? Dr. Carter?

417
00:21:53,671 --> 00:21:55,254
Is everything all right?

418
00:21:56,506 --> 00:21:59,216
If the biopsy doesn't give us
what we want...

419
00:21:59,383 --> 00:22:01,550
...if she needs another kidney...

420
00:22:02,635 --> 00:22:04,136
...could I give her
my other one?

421
00:22:05,428 --> 00:22:08,514
That would require you being on dialysis
for the rest of your life.

422
00:22:08,639 --> 00:22:11,516
- No, I understand that.
- I don't know it's even ethical...

423
00:22:11,683 --> 00:22:14,393
...for someone to donate
their only remaining kidney.

424
00:22:14,851 --> 00:22:16,311
So it's not possible.

425
00:22:17,478 --> 00:22:20,564
I don't know of any responsible doctor
that would agree to do it.

426
00:22:21,856 --> 00:22:24,983
Gabe, listen. I-
I know that you're scared.

427
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,652
But let's just take this
one step at a time.

428
00:22:28,027 --> 00:22:30,029
- Okay?
- Okay.

429
00:22:30,196 --> 00:22:32,781
- Go in there and be with Katie.
- Carter.

430
00:22:32,948 --> 00:22:35,324
Some neurologist in Skokie
sent this fax for you.

431
00:22:35,491 --> 00:22:37,033
Thanks.

432
00:22:39,869 --> 00:22:42,579
It's a "Dear doctor" letter
from the pharmaceutical company.

433
00:22:42,746 --> 00:22:45,915
It says there have been isolated cases
of renal failure on Zarictal.

434
00:22:46,082 --> 00:22:49,668
Yes, I know. It recommends
monthly monitoring of renal function...

435
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:53,503
...which I've been doing with Katie.
BUN, creatinine.

436
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:55,463
- You got one of these?
- Yes, so did you.

437
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:59,133
Letters were sent to every physician
in the country. They're a caution.

438
00:22:59,299 --> 00:23:01,551
- So you knew about this.
- Private practitioners...

439
00:23:01,718 --> 00:23:04,594
...get letters like that all the time.
I followed its recommendations.

440
00:23:04,761 --> 00:23:07,596
But you know what the biopsy's
gonna show, says so right here.

441
00:23:07,763 --> 00:23:11,182
- Well, I'm hoping that's not the case.
- Dr. Carter, do you have a moment?

442
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:13,934
- Problem?
- No, Kerry just-

443
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:18,062
You posted a warning about Zarictal
on an Internet message board?

444
00:23:19,729 --> 00:23:21,398
I posted a request for information.

445
00:23:21,606 --> 00:23:23,983
I'm getting a lot of phone calls.
I hate phone calls.

446
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:27,694
Neurologists, our head of nephrology,
the director from KW Pharmaceuticals-

447
00:23:27,861 --> 00:23:29,486
Just wanted to be better informed.

448
00:23:29,695 --> 00:23:31,989
By jumping to conclusions
based on skimpy evidence?

449
00:23:32,156 --> 00:23:34,866
Tell it to the Milners,
their daughter needs a new kidney.

450
00:23:35,032 --> 00:23:38,577
You have one sick girl, that's unfortunate.
The drug companies have access...

451
00:23:38,743 --> 00:23:41,328
...to thousands of patients
before they release a drug-

452
00:23:41,495 --> 00:23:43,371
They didn't use any renal patients
when-

453
00:23:43,538 --> 00:23:48,375
They can't document every side effect.
You're working beyond your responsibility.

454
00:23:48,542 --> 00:23:50,293
You telling me how to do my job?

455
00:23:50,418 --> 00:23:53,503
I'm telling you the FDA
has an Adverse Drug Event division-

456
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:57,089
Which is run by political appointees
funded by the drug companies.

457
00:23:57,298 --> 00:24:00,508
The number one lobbyist in the country
is the pharmaceutical industry.

458
00:24:00,675 --> 00:24:02,676
Come here. Come on.

459
00:24:05,261 --> 00:24:06,637
- Pick up a bottle.
- Kerry-

460
00:24:06,804 --> 00:24:08,097
Do it.

461
00:24:10,765 --> 00:24:11,974
Pravastatin.

462
00:24:12,141 --> 00:24:14,435
Saves millions from heart attacks
and strokes.

463
00:24:14,643 --> 00:24:16,561
- Enoxaparin. Know what this is?
- Yes, I do.

464
00:24:16,811 --> 00:24:20,606
It offers better PE prophylaxis and allows
DVT patients to be treated at home.

465
00:24:20,856 --> 00:24:24,108
Linezolid. Fights off strains
of MRSA that used to be fatal.

466
00:24:24,275 --> 00:24:25,817
- I think he gets it.
- Does he?

467
00:24:25,984 --> 00:24:28,485
- Yeah, he does.
- These drugs save lives.

468
00:24:28,652 --> 00:24:32,989
The companies that make them donate
$20 million to our academic programs.

469
00:24:33,156 --> 00:24:36,909
Without that, we have no hospital.
We'd be standing in a mini-mall.

470
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:40,952
- That makes it okay to suppress results?
- Who says that's what they're doing?

471
00:24:41,203 --> 00:24:44,246
Putting these drugs out here,
seeing how they work is how we learn.

472
00:24:44,413 --> 00:24:47,790
- It's how medicine advances.
- And that's not naive?

473
00:24:47,957 --> 00:24:52,920
Your job is to take care of your patients,
not start a crusade.

474
00:24:54,921 --> 00:24:58,256
Susan, you're the boss.
Tell him to keep his eye on the ball.

475
00:25:00,008 --> 00:25:02,509
No more computer access for you.

476
00:25:09,389 --> 00:25:11,140
It's like I forgot where I was.

477
00:25:11,307 --> 00:25:14,976
I was just looking at him
like he was a huge...

478
00:25:15,393 --> 00:25:17,561
- ...cupcake.
- You want one?

479
00:25:17,728 --> 00:25:20,063
It's just a metaphor. Thanks.

480
00:25:22,398 --> 00:25:24,775
So you have a crush on Luka.

481
00:25:25,651 --> 00:25:27,234
That's kind of weird.

482
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:28,861
It's just a crush.

483
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:32,197
Crushes are by nature idealized,
unrealistic.

484
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,239
What about Dr. Gibson?
That sounded real.

485
00:25:34,406 --> 00:25:36,950
Gross, but real.

486
00:25:37,951 --> 00:25:40,827
My God, you're right. It's a pattern.

487
00:25:40,994 --> 00:25:43,704
- I'm a slut for authority.
- Stop it.

488
00:25:43,871 --> 00:25:45,872
- Well, what about you?
- What about me?

489
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:49,375
- I heard you punched your med student?
- So?

490
00:25:49,917 --> 00:25:51,919
He was bugging me.

491
00:25:52,169 --> 00:25:54,545
- So you're hung up on a subordinate.
- No, I'm not.

492
00:25:54,712 --> 00:25:59,507
- I have a thing for a supervisor.
- So, what, I'm like the yin to your yang?

493
00:25:59,715 --> 00:26:01,550
What are we gonna do?

494
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:04,969
Ignore it, hope it goes away.

495
00:26:05,136 --> 00:26:08,555
- Right. No need to discuss it.
- No, denial works.

496
00:26:11,932 --> 00:26:14,893
- Sam, dog bite in 3. I wrote for Unasyn.
- I'll get to it.

497
00:26:15,102 --> 00:26:18,354
- You check on my biopsy results yet?
- Yeah, Dubenko is on his way.

498
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,855
- What about my patient in Exam 2?
- I'm waiting on a repeat CBC. Sam?

499
00:26:22,064 --> 00:26:25,733
Done and sent. Nice seeing you all.

500
00:26:30,237 --> 00:26:32,863
Isometric vacuolization
of the renal tubular cells...

501
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:36,408
- ...consistent with drug toxicity.
- No chance that this is rejection?

502
00:26:36,574 --> 00:26:39,493
No tubulitis, no edema, no inflammation.

503
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:42,120
- The girl needs a new kidney.
- And it's from the drug?

504
00:26:42,328 --> 00:26:43,788
I'd say so...

505
00:26:43,955 --> 00:26:46,456
- ...but I don't want to encourage you.
- Encourage me?

506
00:26:46,665 --> 00:26:50,543
Some of my colleagues were suggesting
you've been all over the Internet with this.

507
00:26:50,751 --> 00:26:53,128
- I was trying to be thorough.
- Word of advice?

508
00:26:53,294 --> 00:26:55,587
Don't piss off the money people.

509
00:26:56,588 --> 00:26:58,381
Hi, everybody.

510
00:26:58,923 --> 00:27:00,341
This is Katie's biopsy results.

511
00:27:00,508 --> 00:27:03,468
And unfortunately,
they are not what we had hoped for.

512
00:27:06,345 --> 00:27:09,305
So it's not rejection?

513
00:27:10,722 --> 00:27:12,015
No.

514
00:27:12,224 --> 00:27:14,016
No, it's irreversibly damaged.

515
00:27:18,979 --> 00:27:21,981
And is this from the Zarictal?

516
00:27:22,106 --> 00:27:24,774
No, it could be from the tacrolimus
she's been on.

517
00:27:24,941 --> 00:27:27,860
I doubt that. Her levels
have been therapeutic for two years.

518
00:27:31,821 --> 00:27:36,074
So this drug I've been working
two jobs to pay for...

519
00:27:36,241 --> 00:27:38,242
...just to make her life better...

520
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:41,911
...has ruined her donated kidney?

521
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:46,372
I'm afraid so.

522
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:49,624
You told me-
You told us it was working.

523
00:27:49,833 --> 00:27:52,460
Sometimes drug interaction
can only become apparent...

524
00:27:52,586 --> 00:27:54,879
...after the first year or two of release.

525
00:27:55,045 --> 00:27:58,173
This couldn't have been anticipated.

526
00:27:58,339 --> 00:28:00,966
So we're back to waiting?

527
00:28:01,175 --> 00:28:03,634
Well, UNOS will prioritize her
for a new kidney.

528
00:28:03,801 --> 00:28:06,178
That will take three, four years,
if we're lucky?

529
00:28:06,344 --> 00:28:09,555
In the meantime, I'm gonna recommend
we get a surgeon down here...

530
00:28:09,722 --> 00:28:13,016
...to see about creating a forearm shunt
to facilitate dialysis access.

531
00:28:13,183 --> 00:28:15,101
- I can take care of that.
- Okay.

532
00:28:15,602 --> 00:28:18,437
- We're back to where we started.
- She'll be on that machine...

533
00:28:18,604 --> 00:28:20,771
...all through high school?
Through college?

534
00:28:20,938 --> 00:28:23,231
Just because it took a while
to get the kidney-

535
00:28:23,398 --> 00:28:26,567
No, it didn't take a while,
there wasn't one.

536
00:28:26,734 --> 00:28:29,027
I gave her mine.

537
00:28:42,661 --> 00:28:44,038
We have given up a lot.

538
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,207
Made a lot of sacrifices.

539
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:01,549
You told me this drug was worth it.

540
00:29:19,437 --> 00:29:22,648
Okay, show me your incision.

541
00:29:22,814 --> 00:29:25,775
Fifth ICS, anterior axillary line.

542
00:29:25,941 --> 00:29:27,359
Go for it.

543
00:29:30,611 --> 00:29:32,446
Pulse ox is 92 on five liters.

544
00:29:36,699 --> 00:29:39,159
Push that in just superior to the rib.

545
00:29:43,371 --> 00:29:45,288
Okay, spread the clamp.

546
00:29:45,455 --> 00:29:47,289
Sats are coming up.

547
00:29:49,041 --> 00:29:52,627
And slip your finger
into the pleural space.

548
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:57,296
- I lost the tract.
- That's okay. Keep your finger in there.

549
00:29:57,463 --> 00:29:59,548
Just guide the tube.

550
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,759
I'm above the rib, but it won't pass.

551
00:30:03,801 --> 00:30:05,219
There you go.

552
00:30:07,261 --> 00:30:08,679
Okay.

553
00:30:10,931 --> 00:30:12,474
That is where you want to go.

554
00:30:12,682 --> 00:30:14,642
- All right, I got it.
- Okay.

555
00:30:15,476 --> 00:30:17,102
Keep advancing.

556
00:30:17,268 --> 00:30:21,522
A little bit deeper, because you want
all the ports in the pleural space.

557
00:30:24,107 --> 00:30:26,233
Thora-Seal's ready, so is suction.

558
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,568
That's very good.

559
00:30:30,236 --> 00:30:31,404
Hello?

560
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,906
Okay, sew it in.

561
00:30:41,661 --> 00:30:43,578
Somebody put something
in the water today?

562
00:30:43,745 --> 00:30:47,373
Call it "pulseless electrical activity
following trauma."

563
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:51,000
- Right.
- Change "blade" into "scalpel."

564
00:30:51,167 --> 00:30:55,129
Don't say "torn," say "dissected."
Call it the "field of exposure."

565
00:30:55,294 --> 00:30:57,421
You left out the size of the cordis.

566
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:59,840
-9 French.
- Okay, write it down.

567
00:31:00,006 --> 00:31:03,259
And not "blood."
"Packed red cells."

568
00:31:04,051 --> 00:31:05,468
Okay, good job.

569
00:31:05,677 --> 00:31:08,138
- Just make the changes, and I'll co-sign.
- Okay.

570
00:31:08,303 --> 00:31:09,596
Hey, Neela.

571
00:31:12,265 --> 00:31:15,767
I hope I didn't give you
the wrong impression.

572
00:31:15,976 --> 00:31:19,353
You're a Resident and I'm an Attending,
and I want to help you learn-

573
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,980
Yeah, I got it.
I understand. I'm sorry.

574
00:31:22,147 --> 00:31:24,357
No, it's just-
I wouldn't want anything to get-

575
00:31:24,523 --> 00:31:26,608
I got it, I got it. I got it, thanks.

576
00:31:41,535 --> 00:31:42,995
Vitals are stable.

577
00:31:43,161 --> 00:31:45,246
- I need to grab an amp of bicarb.
- Okay.

578
00:31:48,164 --> 00:31:50,041
Katie's T waves are back to normal...

579
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:54,002
...which means her potassium
has come down. That's good.

580
00:31:55,336 --> 00:31:56,629
He went to work.

581
00:31:57,713 --> 00:31:59,006
Mr. Milner?

582
00:32:01,883 --> 00:32:03,967
He took a second job...

583
00:32:05,635 --> 00:32:08,929
...as a security guard
over at the jewelry center...

584
00:32:09,138 --> 00:32:13,891
...just to try to help pay for everything,
you know?

585
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:20,061
Nothing means more to him
than Katie getting well.

586
00:32:20,395 --> 00:32:22,022
Nothing.

587
00:32:23,188 --> 00:32:25,816
Her illness just changed him.

588
00:32:26,816 --> 00:32:28,276
Ruined our marriage.

589
00:32:28,443 --> 00:32:30,235
It's important to stay optimistic.

590
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:35,323
A lot of good things could still happen,
Mrs. Milner.

591
00:32:39,575 --> 00:32:42,536
MVC with passenger-space intrusion.
ETA, 7.

592
00:32:42,702 --> 00:32:44,662
- Okay, we'll take it.
- What's MVC?

593
00:32:44,787 --> 00:32:47,331
Motor vehicle collision,
another new protocol.

594
00:32:47,497 --> 00:32:50,708
- No such thing as an accident.
- I liked MVA.

595
00:32:50,875 --> 00:32:53,627
- I like walks in the springtime.
- John, a minute, please?

596
00:32:53,835 --> 00:32:55,961
I'll catch up to you.

597
00:32:56,128 --> 00:32:58,672
I was aware of the potential for toxicity.

598
00:32:58,881 --> 00:33:01,507
But it was only one case report
in an obscure journal.

599
00:33:01,674 --> 00:33:04,718
Well, you could have found out more
doing a simple Medline search.

600
00:33:04,885 --> 00:33:08,387
I can't do a Medline search
every time I put a patient on a new drug.

601
00:33:08,554 --> 00:33:10,764
- I've got 20 patients on Zarictal.
- Twenty?

602
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:12,139
They're all doing well.

603
00:33:12,306 --> 00:33:14,308
What, are you
on the Keating-Ward payroll?

604
00:33:14,475 --> 00:33:16,684
Listen, as part of an ongoing study...

605
00:33:16,851 --> 00:33:20,103
...I send in a monthly update
on each patient's progress.

606
00:33:20,312 --> 00:33:21,605
And they compensate you?

607
00:33:21,771 --> 00:33:24,607
A small stipend for my time.

608
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:28,567
- Hope your malpractice premiums are paid.
- There's nothing wrong with it.

609
00:33:28,734 --> 00:33:32,528
I am reimbursed for helping monitor a drug
by doing thorough patient evaluations.

610
00:33:32,695 --> 00:33:36,073
That the company only pays attention
to if it says what they want it to.

611
00:33:36,239 --> 00:33:38,616
Her seizures stopped.
She was very happy.

612
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:41,118
- The father was thrilled.
- He's real thrilled now.

613
00:33:41,284 --> 00:33:44,079
Listen, I am trying to be
a cutting-edge clinician.

614
00:33:44,245 --> 00:33:45,704
- That's what the patients want.
- Guys.

615
00:33:45,913 --> 00:33:48,623
I have to offer the most
efficacious meds on the market.

616
00:33:48,915 --> 00:33:52,084
Well, the problem is that last part,
isn't it? The market.

617
00:33:52,459 --> 00:33:53,710
What?

618
00:33:58,505 --> 00:34:00,090
Mr. Milner?

619
00:34:01,465 --> 00:34:04,009
- Hey.
- Hey.

620
00:34:05,968 --> 00:34:07,511
I was...

621
00:34:11,305 --> 00:34:13,890
I was going to work,
and I thought, "Why? "

622
00:34:15,975 --> 00:34:17,476
What is the point now?

623
00:34:18,727 --> 00:34:21,270
Gabe, put the gun away.

624
00:34:23,064 --> 00:34:25,357
I put everything in your hands.

625
00:34:25,482 --> 00:34:28,442
Everything. And you let her down.

626
00:34:28,651 --> 00:34:33,196
Listen, Katie can still live a long,
productive life on dialysis.

627
00:34:34,488 --> 00:34:36,073
Okay, whoa.

628
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:38,616
- Come on, why shouldn't I?
- Please.

629
00:34:38,825 --> 00:34:41,785
You know what we should do?
Let's go inside and see your family.

630
00:34:42,577 --> 00:34:46,830
Come on, let's go inside
and we'll see your family right now.

631
00:34:50,499 --> 00:34:54,210
I want to give my kidney to her.

632
00:34:55,962 --> 00:34:57,170
Okay.

633
00:34:57,337 --> 00:35:00,881
Hey, maybe I was wrong about that.
Maybe you can be the donor.

634
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:03,383
You're lying. I know you're lying.

635
00:35:07,928 --> 00:35:10,805
- Fix her, okay?
- Yeah.

636
00:35:10,972 --> 00:35:13,223
- For me.
- Yeah, we're gonna fix her.

637
00:35:20,687 --> 00:35:23,230
- Sats down to 88.
- Can you see the cords?

638
00:35:23,438 --> 00:35:24,731
Lots of blood.

639
00:35:24,898 --> 00:35:27,567
- All right, somebody go find his wife.
- Okay, tube.

640
00:35:28,942 --> 00:35:32,069
And get that girl out of here.
Come on, move her to another room.

641
00:35:32,236 --> 00:35:34,446
Gray matter covers the occiput.

642
00:35:34,613 --> 00:35:37,448
- Why the hell would he do this?
- He was distraught.

643
00:35:37,615 --> 00:35:39,199
Pupils fixed and dilated.

644
00:35:39,366 --> 00:35:41,368
Pressure's only 80/60.

645
00:35:41,535 --> 00:35:44,203
- Start dopamine at 10 mics.
- No gag when I tubed him.

646
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:45,745
No. No corneal reflex.

647
00:35:46,496 --> 00:35:49,623
- Can he regain any function?
- No, he's as brain-dead as they come.

648
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:54,043
- I'll go talk to her.
- No. No, no, no, wait. Let me.

649
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:55,919
I'm her family's doctor.

650
00:35:58,296 --> 00:36:00,631
Transplant coordinator's down.

651
00:36:12,264 --> 00:36:14,890
Technically, there's nobody else
who can give consent.

652
00:36:15,057 --> 00:36:17,184
The girl has a very rare tissue type,
Amparo.

653
00:36:17,351 --> 00:36:20,270
- The father is a match.
- I've made that clear to UNOS.

654
00:36:20,437 --> 00:36:23,022
Look, I'm trying to get them
to allow us to proceed.

655
00:36:23,188 --> 00:36:24,981
For now, keep him on Fi02 of 100.

656
00:36:25,148 --> 00:36:27,774
Make sure the girl's NPO in the hope
she goes to the O.R.

657
00:36:27,983 --> 00:36:30,651
- Just do everything that you can, okay?
- I will.

658
00:36:30,818 --> 00:36:33,779
- Go back under your rock.
- I'm from the Trib. It's a good paper.

659
00:36:33,945 --> 00:36:35,614
Yeah, right. You guys endorsed Bush.

660
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:38,741
Man, a guy shoots himself.
What's next, a plague of frogs?

661
00:36:38,907 --> 00:36:41,951
There's a gang of press outside.
Someone has to go talk to them...

662
00:36:42,118 --> 00:36:45,495
- ...get them the hell out of here.
- Obviously, the guy was depressed.

663
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:50,123
All we know is he's in critical condition.
We can't go into any details.

664
00:36:50,832 --> 00:36:55,210
"Heartfelt sympathy to the family.
We're doing everything we can." Good?

665
00:36:56,295 --> 00:36:59,464
- You want me to talk to them?
- You treated these people.

666
00:36:59,672 --> 00:37:02,924
Just play up the fact we're respecting
the family's privacy, okay?

667
00:37:03,466 --> 00:37:06,260
M.A.P. is only 90.
Can we go up on the dopamine?

668
00:37:06,384 --> 00:37:09,636
We're maxed out.
I got a p. r.n. for Levophed.

669
00:37:09,845 --> 00:37:11,388
Sounds good.

670
00:37:13,473 --> 00:37:15,683
Maybe we need to talk?

671
00:37:16,017 --> 00:37:18,143
No, we really don't.

672
00:37:19,643 --> 00:37:22,605
It's just he helped me to adjust
coming back to work here.

673
00:37:22,771 --> 00:37:25,690
He made things a lot easier,
and I guess...

674
00:37:27,733 --> 00:37:30,610
I don't know, I got confused.

675
00:37:31,986 --> 00:37:34,571
I get confused every time I look at him.

676
00:37:38,115 --> 00:37:40,116
Did you work on this family?

677
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:43,452
His daughter, yeah.

678
00:37:43,994 --> 00:37:45,536
I'm sorry.

679
00:37:48,331 --> 00:37:50,332
Levophed's going at two mics.

680
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:53,709
Does Gabriel Milner have a daughter
being treated in ER?

681
00:37:53,876 --> 00:37:56,002
- Yes, he does.
- Now, is it true...

682
00:37:56,211 --> 00:37:58,921
- ...she's suffering from kidney failure?
- I can't say.

683
00:37:59,088 --> 00:38:01,548
Didn't you indicate that earlier
on a medical website?

684
00:38:01,715 --> 00:38:04,342
- No, I made some general queries...
- Abby.

685
00:38:05,217 --> 00:38:06,885
- Hi.
- Hey.

686
00:38:10,012 --> 00:38:12,138
Do you want to go get something to eat?

687
00:38:12,305 --> 00:38:16,850
I know this
awesome little Ethiopian place.

688
00:38:17,059 --> 00:38:19,685
They make you eat with your hands...

689
00:38:19,852 --> 00:38:23,063
...but I got sterile gloves in my bag,
so it's okay.

690
00:38:24,231 --> 00:38:26,690
- Dinner?
- Yeah.

691
00:38:27,066 --> 00:38:28,399
No.

692
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:30,568
But don't take it personally.

693
00:38:34,196 --> 00:38:35,780
Okay.

694
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:38,615
I'm not really a subtle guy.

695
00:38:38,782 --> 00:38:42,618
But I was under the impression that
there's sort of a thing happening here.

696
00:38:42,785 --> 00:38:47,080
- Maybe not a big thing, but still, a thing.
- A thing?

697
00:38:49,623 --> 00:38:51,290
Yeah. Yeah, maybe there's a thing...

698
00:38:51,457 --> 00:38:54,042
...but you know what,
nothing's gonna happen.

699
00:38:54,835 --> 00:38:57,294
- Why is that?
- Well, a lot of reasons...

700
00:38:57,461 --> 00:39:01,256
...which I won't mention because I don't
feel like sharing my checkered past.

701
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:04,007
- Why?
- Or my various neuroses.

702
00:39:04,174 --> 00:39:07,260
But there's one really big reason
that's a deal breaker for me.

703
00:39:08,386 --> 00:39:10,012
You miss the beard?

704
00:39:10,345 --> 00:39:11,721
No.

705
00:39:12,055 --> 00:39:13,430
You're my student.

706
00:39:15,891 --> 00:39:17,559
I'm grading you.

707
00:39:20,227 --> 00:39:22,563
Well, I think that that is not appropriate.

708
00:39:24,438 --> 00:39:26,439
And have a good night.

709
00:39:28,191 --> 00:39:33,903
You know, what if I was willing
to take an F right now?

710
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:39,157
Yeah, I forgot to mention to you
that I'm dropping out of med school.

711
00:39:39,324 --> 00:39:43,451
Yeah. Who wants to be a doctor anyway?

712
00:39:46,662 --> 00:39:48,998
It's incumbent upon you to share
the information...

713
00:39:49,205 --> 00:39:52,375
...if you have possible fatal side
effects of a popular new drug?

714
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:58,421
Katie Milner was on Zarictal
for three months...

715
00:39:58,962 --> 00:40:01,756
...and, yes, I believe the drug
ruined her kidney.

716
00:40:01,923 --> 00:40:05,675
"Out of respect for the family,
that's all I can say." Is that so hard?

717
00:40:05,842 --> 00:40:07,969
- They knew it all already.
- No, they didn't.

718
00:40:08,136 --> 00:40:12,471
You're alleging potential slander that
could cost the hospital millions in support.

719
00:40:12,638 --> 00:40:15,765
What are you worried about, free
pens, coffee cups and drug samples?

720
00:40:15,932 --> 00:40:20,602
I'm worried about research grants, a thing
HIPAA calls "patient confidentiality."

721
00:40:20,769 --> 00:40:23,771
- I didn't want to talk to them!
- "Out of respect for the family."

722
00:40:23,938 --> 00:40:26,648
You wanna talk to them,
then you do it. It's your damn ER.

723
00:40:26,815 --> 00:40:28,899
- You're right, I will.
- Dr. Lewis, Dr. Weaver.

724
00:40:29,066 --> 00:40:32,444
Oh, I wonder what she wants
to talk to me about?

725
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:34,279
It's true, right?

726
00:40:34,862 --> 00:40:36,613
You did a good thing.

727
00:40:39,115 --> 00:40:40,783
You say that like it matters.

728
00:40:42,993 --> 00:40:45,286
- You ready to go?
- Yeah.

729
00:40:51,123 --> 00:40:53,751
UNOS gave us the go ahead.
We're gonna do the transplant.

730
00:40:53,917 --> 00:40:56,961
- Oh, thank God.
- They're bringing Mr. Milner up.

731
00:40:57,128 --> 00:41:00,589
She doesn't know where the kidney's
coming from. I haven't told her yet.

732
00:41:00,756 --> 00:41:04,758
That can wait. Let's go inside
and talk with the anesthesiologist.

733
00:41:11,971 --> 00:41:13,972
You a medical student?

734
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:16,099
First-year Resident.

735
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:20,393
How's that going?

736
00:41:21,102 --> 00:41:24,980
Some days are better than others.
I like it well enough.

737
00:41:28,316 --> 00:41:30,484
What do you think they'll tell Katie?

738
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:34,111
They'll tell her that her father loved her.

739
00:41:36,113 --> 00:41:38,031
Maybe too much.

740
00:41:44,202 --> 00:41:46,661
Transplant surgery's underway.

741
00:41:50,831 --> 00:41:54,793
I can't take responsibility
for how the system works...

742
00:41:54,959 --> 00:41:57,461
...but I can try to do my job better.

743
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,338
That's all any of us can do.

744
00:42:01,005 --> 00:42:04,049
I don't know why I was surprised
to find you here.

745
00:42:04,549 --> 00:42:06,008
Of course you're still here.

746
00:42:08,177 --> 00:42:12,055
Hope we see each other again,
under more favorable circumstances.

747
00:42:12,222 --> 00:42:15,015
You were always good to me
when I was a student.

748
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,475
I remember that.

749
00:42:30,609 --> 00:42:34,612
Anspaugh wants to see us and Weaver
in his office tomorrow morning.

750
00:42:34,779 --> 00:42:37,948
- Suture removal in Curtain 3.
- Hey...

751
00:42:38,864 --> 00:42:42,909
...if any of this rolls back onto you,
I'm sorry.

752
00:42:47,871 --> 00:42:49,872
- Mr. Klossey?
- Hi, doc.

753
00:42:50,039 --> 00:42:53,542
How are you today?
What are we looking at here?

754
00:42:53,708 --> 00:42:59,379
I did this skiing on Michigan Avenue,
cross-country, during the last big snow.

755
00:42:59,546 --> 00:43:01,547
Little fall, gashed my arm.

756
00:43:01,755 --> 00:43:05,716
But I hadn't done it in 10 years,
so even that felt good.

757
00:43:05,967 --> 00:43:09,678
- Why did you stop?
- Arthritis. I had it bad.

758
00:43:09,886 --> 00:43:13,055
Couldn't bowl, couldn't sit
in those seats at Wrigley...

759
00:43:13,222 --> 00:43:14,973
...take my niece for a walk.

760
00:43:15,557 --> 00:43:18,183
So, what happened?

761
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:21,644
I saw an ad on TV for Renuvium.

762
00:43:21,811 --> 00:43:24,271
A doc at the clinic gave
me a prescription.

763
00:43:24,437 --> 00:43:26,439
Fixed me right up.

764
00:43:26,982 --> 00:43:29,233
- Renuvium?
- Yeah, a little red pill...

765
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,235
...once in the morning,
let me do all those things...

766
00:43:32,402 --> 00:43:34,861
...I thought I had given up forever.

767
00:43:35,028 --> 00:43:37,905
- That's something, huh?
- Yeah.

768
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:41,074
Okay, this might hurt just a little bit.

769
00:43:41,992 --> 00:43:45,744
Damn miracle of medicine,
that's what it is.
