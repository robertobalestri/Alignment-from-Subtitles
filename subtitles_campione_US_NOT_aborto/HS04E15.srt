1
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,000
You like that?

2
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,300
Uh...

3
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,100
I don't know.

4
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,800
You want me to use
my butt again?

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,300
I don't know
how i got here.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,300
How many drinks
did i have?

7
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,500
Your scotch
hasn't even arrived yet.

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,200
Means i was drunk
when i got here.

9
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,700
8:50.

10
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,100
I remember being at work.

11
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,400
I've lost at least four hours.

12
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,600
Say five words.

13
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,700
What do you mean?

14
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,400
That's four words.

15
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,100
The accepted diagnostic test
for global memory impairment

16
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,600
Is five random words.

17
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,800
Are you okay?

18
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,900
I'm...
trying to find that out.

19
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,300
Give me five animals.

20
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,600
Um... cat, bird,

21
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,400
Monkey.

22
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,300
Rhino. Goldfish.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,400
Monkey. Rhino...

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,500
Either i'm massively
drunk...

25
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,100
Oh, you're bleeding.

26
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,300
Or it's someone else's
blood.

27
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,400
Do you see a wound?

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,100
- How bad is it?
- It's all over.

29
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,900
I have a concussion.

30
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,700
Retrograde amnesia.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,700
No keys, no phone.

32
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,900
I've been mugged.

33
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,200
<i>No, you haven't.</i>

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,300
You already
gave me a 20.

35
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,300
- Did you earn it?
- Not yet.

36
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,100
Someone
is going to die.

37
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,600
Kenny!

38
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,900
Not you.

39
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,800
I saw something.
A symptom.

40
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,500
Someone is going to die
unless i find them.

41
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,300
Who?

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,200
I have no idea.

43
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,800
Keep the change.

48
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,600
<i>You saw 30 people</i>

49
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,400
Flying into
glass and metal.

50
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,500
I saw a symptom
before the crash.

51
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,500
You're concussed-
You don't know what you saw,

52
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,600
And you don't know
when you saw it.

53
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,300
A week ago, you noticed
a symptom in a soap star.

54
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,200
Bad argument.
Since i was right about that.

55
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,500
But your brain obviously thinks
it happened last night.

56
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,700
Wires are crossed.

57
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,700
That's all of it.

58
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,000
A few stitches
will hold your brain in place.

59
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,500
Ow!

60
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,300
Hey, hold your head still,

61
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,800
Unless you want me to sew
your nose onto your eye.

62
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,400
Why was i taking the bus?

63
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,700
Because you were drunk.

64
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,500
What if i saw someone
and i followed them on from...

65
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,000
Somewhere in princeton?

66
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,500
You okay?

67
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,700
Perfect.

68
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,700
Uh... uh...

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,900
You.

70
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,600
Get histories
from everyone in here.

71
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,100
Did you just forget
his name?

72
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,100
No.

73
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,900
Lesbian.

74
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,100
Find out if anybody
on that bus

75
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,600
Was taken
to other hospitals.

76
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,600
He just forgot mine.

77
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,400
No, thirteen.

78
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,400
I just wanted
to call you a lesbian.

79
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,300
I'm not a lesbian.

80
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,500
I was rounding up.
From 50%.

81
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,700
Find my cane and motorcycle.

82
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,300
Figure out
where i went last night.

83
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,300
Where's your cane
and motorcycle?

84
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,000
And where'd you go
last night?

85
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,200
You gonna trust me?
I lie about everything.

86
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,700
<i>You're staying
the night.</i>

87
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,000
We need to monitor
your brain for swelling.

88
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,800
How much bigger
could it get?

89
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,700
You don't think it's...

90
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,100
A little weird

91
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,800
That there is both
a giant crash

92
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,600
And a simultaneous,
mysterious symptom sighting?

93
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,300
What if it's not
a coincidence?

94
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,300
You mean like the hand
of god reaching down

95
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,700
And screwing with you?

96
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,800
That. Or the symptom
caused the crash.

97
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,500
You see anybody
in a bus driver's uniform?

98
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,600
Right here.

99
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,400
Purpura
on lalph klamden's neck.

100
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,600
Indicative of leukemia.

101
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,100
<i>It caused the bleed
in the brain,</i>

102
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,800
Hence the accident...

103
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
<i>Indicative
of wearing a seatbelt.</i>

104
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,300
It's just a bruise.

105
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,600
I have leukemia?

106
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,300
No. We just ruled that out.
Pay attention.

107
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,800
You probably had a seizure.

108
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,300
I didn't have a seizure.

109
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,700
I got hit
by a garbage truck.

110
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,300
Which you drove into
while you were seizing.

111
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,300
<i>You saw the bus driver</i>

112
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,000
Exhibiting the initial
stages of a seizure

113
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And didn't bother
telling him to pull over?

114
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,600
Hey!

115
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,900
Nobody leaves here until
i say they can be discharged.

116
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:35,700
She said i was-

117
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,800
Is she me?

118
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,700
You have a fever.

119
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,600
No. I'm fine.

120
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,300
98.6.

121
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,700
I need him to stay.

122
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,500
<i>Pulse is normal.
Bp's normal.</i>

123
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,600
<i>Everything's normal.</i>

124
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,600
I just have a stiff
neck from the crash.

125
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,800
A stiff neck.

126
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,300
This man
has meningitis.

127
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,700
We need to quarantine
the whole e.R.

128
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,600
No one leaves here until
their full workup is complete.

129
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,500
<i>You left here
at 5:23 p.M.</i>

130
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,800
<i>Your motorcycle
never made it home.</i>

131
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,900
Well... that covers
ten seconds

132
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,000
Out of the four hours
i can't remember.

133
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,500
Where else did you look?

134
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,300
We did pull up a list
of all the injuries.

135
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,900
22 victims were brought here,

136
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,700
Injuries ranging
from a broken pelvis

137
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,200
<i>To a severed right foot.</i>

138
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,600
The other eight were
taken over to princeton general.

139
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,200
It would be helpful

140
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,300
If these came with
head shots and resumes.

141
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,000
<i>20-Something-Year-Old
jane doe.</i>

142
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,500
Kidney contusion,
laceration on her leg.

143
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,400
Both of which
are expected complications

144
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,700
When someone goes
from 60 to 0 in no seconds flat.

145
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,900
<i>The weirdest thing
we've got is a ruptured spleen.</i>

146
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,000
Okay. New plan.

147
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,900
We make a list of all the bars
between here and the crash site.

148
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,300
<i>We find out where i went,
we go there-</i>

149
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,200
<i>On it.</i>

150
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,300
You're not gonna
do anything, are you?

151
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,600
We're gonna go to the e.R.
And do our jobs.

152
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,900
Someone is dying
because i can't remember-

153
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,800
When you remember,
you can page us.

154
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,600
<i>The shortest distance
between here and your memory</i>

155
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,600
Is straight through
your prefrontal cortex.

156
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,300
<i>All we have to do
is access it.</i>

157
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,300
Great idea.

158
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,900
I'll build
the giant submarine.

159
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,500
You get the miniaturization
gizmo.

160
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,300
<i>Medical hypnosis
can bring the brain</i>

161
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,100
<i>To a class ii theta state,</i>

162
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,200
Increasing focus
and memory retrieval.

163
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,500
You're not gonna make me
do the chicken dance, are you?

164
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,800
Someone in the surgical
department must be trained.

165
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,500
Just relax.

166
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,700
<i>Keep letting go of
any intrusive thoughts.</i>

167
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,900
So what, you saw an ad
in the back of a comic book?

168
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,400
Shh. I did a rotation
in melbourne.

169
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,000
Focus on the sound
of your breath.

170
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,100
You're taxing
an already injured brain.

171
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,400
<i>It's like telling him
to walk it off</i>

172
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,800
After a broken ankle.

173
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,900
Wilson is done
talking now.

174
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,900
Visualize the bus.

175
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,400
The way it looked,
the way it smelled.

176
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
The people on it.
What they look like.

177
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,400
This is a waste of-

178
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,100
Time.

179
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,700
Cool.

180
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,900
Focus on the details.

181
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,100
Bus is empty.

182
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,700
Is this really working?

183
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,100
Shh. Just...

184
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,200
Focus.
Clear your mind.

185
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,200
Think back
to how you felt.

186
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,700
Details you saw.

187
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,300
I can't see
out the windows.

188
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,400
And i can see you guys.

189
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,200
Memories further from
the incident should be clearer.

190
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,400
<i>Where were you before
you got on the bus?</i>

191
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,900
<i>Why'd you get so drunk</i>

192
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,300
<i>At 5:00 in the afternoon,
alone?</i>

193
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,900
I need a reason?

194
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,300
God, i hate
"beer" brand beer.

195
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,100
When he's hypnotized,
can he lie?

196
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,000
- He-
- I can be mistaken.

197
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,300
I can't actually lie
under hypnosis.

198
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,100
- Is he lying?
- No.

199
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,400
What are you running
away from?

200
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,200
<i>When i'm drinking
without you,</i>

201
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,400
What am i running
away from?

202
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,600
Hmm. One of those
imponderables.

203
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,200
<i>Can you hold off
on your insecurities</i>

204
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,600
Until we find
this patient?

205
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,400
Do you see anyone
in the bar?

206
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I see a faceless crowd.

207
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,700
How do i focus?

208
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,700
Say something
to make me focus.

209
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,300
<i>He's concerned about you.</i>

210
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,200
Why does that mean
he's insecure?

211
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,500
Get your... girlfriend
outta here.

212
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,100
It's a legit question.

213
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,100
<i>Amber's there?</i>

214
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,500
You've got amber
in your head?

215
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,900
You put her in my head.

216
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:50,800
I can't even have

217
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,600
A conversation with you
in my subconscious

218
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,100
Without her tagging along.

219
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,800
She'd better have
her clothes on.

220
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,700
Unfortunately.

221
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,500
I didn't mean
to say that out loud.

222
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,400
Say what out loud?

223
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,600
I didn't say it out loud?

224
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,500
Nothing.

225
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,000
What's going on
in there?

226
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,100
If i can't lie,
i need these two outta here.

227
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,800
Let's just... ignore wilson
and amber from now on, shall we?

228
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,000
I wish it were that-

229
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,800
That's some program they
got down there in melbourne.

230
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,400
Cheers.

231
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,900
I remember the bartender.

232
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
<i>Good. Now you're accessing
your temporal lobe.</i>

233
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,400
Does the bartender have
any odd symptoms?

234
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,500
No. He seems fine.

235
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,000
Anybody here sick?

236
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,700
Anyone here
taking the bus?

237
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,700
You are.

238
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,000
Because
you took my keys.

239
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,400
<i>Good. This is good.</i>

240
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,100
<i>Now we can retrace
your steps.</i>

241
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,300
<i>Let's go back to the bus.
What's in front of you?</i>

242
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,900
<i>Passengers.</i>

243
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,000
<i>Anything... special
about them?</i>

244
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,600
Some emo guitar hero
wannabe.

245
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,000
<i>You're focusing on him.</i>

246
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,100
<i>Why?</i>

247
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,800
<i>Because nose picking
could mean nasal peritis.</i>

248
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,500
He's dying.

249
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,100
You a nose picker?

250
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,000
Do i have to answer-

251
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,500
If the answer was no,
you'd have answered.

252
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,500
Tilt your head back.

253
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,200
He's fine.
He doesn't even have meningitis.

254
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,300
Just like everybody else we've
had to give meningitis shots to.

255
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,300
You can go.

256
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,900
You have a brain tumor.

257
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,700
You're kidding, right?

258
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,200
If i was kidding,
i'd be dressed like you.

259
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,600
You're fine.
A nurse will sign you out.

260
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,400
Go home. Have fun.
Relax.

261
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,100
I'm probably
just a nut case.

262
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,200
Tilt your head back.

263
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,500
You can
get your things and go.

264
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,200
You need to rest.

265
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,700
I'm mitting you.

266
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,400
<i>Oh!</i>

267
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,700
Oh!

268
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,900
<i>I can't get up.</i>

269
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,800
I can't move my legs.

270
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,000
Your legs are not
your biggest problem.

271
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,400
Your biggest problem is

272
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,500
I don't know what
your biggest problem is.

273
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,500
So we have the who
but not the what.

274
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,800
<i>We've only got
one symptom to go on-</i>

275
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,400
Sudden onset paralysis.

276
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,800
We actually have
two symptoms.

277
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,300
Only one that we remember.

278
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,900
<i>You did a full workup on
the guy-Did you find anything?</i>

279
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,600
<i>Ct ruled out
subdural hematoma,</i>

280
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,400
Stroke,
or subarachnoid hemorrhage.

281
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,700
Guillain-Barre fits.

282
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,100
Just trying to figure out
what guillain-Barre looks like.

283
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,600
<i>You can't just
eliminate everything</i>

284
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,700
Because it doesn't match
what you might have seen.

285
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,700
How 'bout because
it doesn't match

286
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,900
What i could have seen?

287
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,300
Guillain-Barre has no external
physical manifestations.

288
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,500
Everything has some external
physical manifestations.

289
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,400
And you're obsessive enough
to notice any of them,

290
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,900
Which means there's nothing
we can rule out.

291
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,700
Elevated white count.
Makes transverse myelitis-

292
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,400
Yeah, sudden paralysis
while driving a bus.

293
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,700
That's the sort
of subtle clue

294
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,700
That only a genius
would have noticed.

295
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,000
Are you sure
you're feeling okay?

296
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,800
Where are you
going?

297
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,700
To smell a bus.
Obviously.

298
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,000
Yeah. I'll, uh,
start him on antibiotics

299
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
In case it's
transverse myelitis.

300
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,000
You guys go...
sniff a city bus.

301
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,600
Why are you smelling
the passengers' clothes?

302
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,500
Smell is the most powerful
evokerater of memory.

303
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,500
I need to get back
on that bus.

304
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,100
Okay. So why are you
taking so much vicodin?

305
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,000
If cuddy asks,

306
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,800
Blocking the pain
helps focus the memory.

307
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,700
You split your head open.
You should rest.

308
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,200
Anything?

309
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,200
Hint of...

310
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,900
Exploded bus.

311
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
<i>House, that's four vicodin
in 40 seconds.</i>

312
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,800
At this rate-

313
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,800
Wish me luck.

314
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,500
I'm going in...
rambo style.

315
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,300
<i>House, do you think
this is gonna work,</i>

316
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,900
<i>Or are you just stoned?</i>

317
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,300
Both, apparently.

318
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,100
<i>You're wrong.</i>

319
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,600
It's not working.

320
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,000
So you're saying
i'm not here.

321
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,200
If it was a real memory,
you'd be limping,

322
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,700
<i>And you wouldn't
be talking to me.</i>

323
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,800
I'm obviously a hallucination.

324
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,100
Okay. So i went a little
heavy on the vicodin.

325
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,300
Better hope so.
'Cause otherwise...

326
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,800
Means your brain's
bleeding.

327
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,000
We're both in my head.

328
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,000
I think one of us
would have noticed the blood.

329
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,600
Why haven't you had
a head ct yet?

330
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,200
<i>Who do you want me to treat,
me or you?</i>

331
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,800
- Did you have a seizure?
- Dumb question.

332
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,300
<i>The brain's too fried
during a seizure</i>

333
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,400
To form memories.

334
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,400
Dumb answer.

335
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,200
I wasn't asking you.
I was asking me.

336
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,500
You've already proven
that you're not here.

337
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,300
- I'm getting a headache.
- Is that a clue?

338
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,000
Again... i'm not here.

339
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,300
<i>You're getting a headache.</i>

340
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,800
Stop arguing with
a hallucination

341
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,000
And get some treatment.

342
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,800
<i>He can't.</i>

343
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,400
The hallucination
is your messed up brain's way

344
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,000
Of reasoning out
a problem.

345
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,300
You weren't on the bus.

346
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,800
How do you know?

347
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,000
<i>$500 shoes.</i>

348
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,600
Not on the princeton
cross-Town.

349
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,700
Must be another reason
why i'm here.

350
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,500
Yes.

351
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,500
What do you have
to tell me?

352
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,900
I was talking
to the passengers on the bus!

353
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,700
You were hallucinating.
You're getting an mri.

354
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,600
<i>Stop fidgeting.</i>

355
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,300
If you haven't found
the bleed yet, it can't be-

356
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,100
There's edema
and localized swelling

357
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,500
In the section
of the temporal lobe

358
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,400
That controls
short-Term memory.

359
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,700
<i>Also, the penis-Size cortex
is set to "pathetic."</i>

360
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,000
What didn't you say
out loud?

361
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,200
Very little.

362
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,200
<i>When you were under
hypnosis,</i>

363
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,200
You were talking
to amber.

364
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,600
I wanted
to see her naked.

365
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,500
Seriously,
what were you hiding?

366
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,100
I wanna see her naked.

367
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,700
You wanna see everyone naked.
Why would you hide that?

368
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,100
Some guys get upset when
you objectify their girlfriends.

369
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,300
But if you're okay,
i've got a digital video camera,

370
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:45,800
So we could-

371
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,600
<i>Why would i be upset that
you're treating my girlfriend</i>

372
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,900
<i>Like you treat every
other woman on the planet?</i>

373
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,900
Unless... you're not.

374
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,400
<i>Unless it's deeper than that.</i>

375
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,400
<i>You weren't
objectifying her.</i>

376
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,400
Trust me.

377
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,900
I wanna do some very nasty,

378
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,000
Demeaning stuff
to your girlfriend.

379
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,900
You have feelings for her.

380
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,500
This is bad.

381
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,700
It's a longitudinal
fracture of the temporal bone.

382
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,000
I banged my head.

383
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,600
This isn't
just a boo-Boo.

384
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,600
I'll rest once i figure out
what's wrong with this guy.

385
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,100
Why? Why this guy?

386
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,400
You want patients with
weird, undiagnosed symptoms,

387
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,100
You get five files like that
on your desk every morning.

388
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,600
You'd never risk
your life for them.

389
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,600
<i>Why is this guy so special</i>

390
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,700
That you've become batman?

391
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:42,700
I don't know.

392
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,700
<i>Maybe it's because</i>

393
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,200
<i>You have a cracked skull
and you're not yourself.</i>

394
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,700
Go home.
Go to sleep.

395
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,200
My legs are holding.

396
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,400
Good. Now put all your
weight on your right leg.

397
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,900
The antibiotics are working.
It's tm.

398
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,100
<i>It's 2:00 in the morning.</i>

399
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:37,700
<i>You should be home,</i>

400
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,600
Resting what's left
of your bruised brain.

401
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,200
Recovery's too fast.

402
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,000
The fact
that he's getting better

403
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,300
Is evidence
that we're wrong?

404
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:44,999
I need to sit.

405
00:19:46,233 --> 00:19:47,878
Recovery slow enough
for you now?

406
00:19:48,344 --> 00:19:49,300
Oh... it's my stomach!

407
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,487
Which means it's not
transverse myelitis.

408
00:19:52,487 --> 00:19:54,581
Rapid onset-Could be
a perforated ulcer.

409
00:19:54,581 --> 00:19:56,550
Wouldn't explain
the paralysis.

410
00:19:56,933 --> 00:19:58,200
Addison's.

411
00:19:58,233 --> 00:19:59,767
<i>From a tumor.</i>

412
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,834
It's possible
i saw his eyelids droop.

413
00:20:01,866 --> 00:20:04,400
We've scanned his head
five times.

414
00:20:05,433 --> 00:20:07,033
You're bleeding.

415
00:20:07,066 --> 00:20:08,600
Little thing
called a bus crash.

416
00:20:08,633 --> 00:20:10,175
It's just
a scalp laceration.

417
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:11,878
Could be hidden
in his optic chiasm.

418
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,238
<i>It's coming
from your ear.</i>

419
00:20:13,933 --> 00:20:15,500
Think
that's a good thing?

420
00:20:15,533 --> 00:20:18,033
But that would have
affected his eyesight.

421
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,500
I need to take a bath.

422
00:20:22,362 --> 00:20:25,600
<i>Hallucinations and smells
were kind of working, right?</i>

423
00:20:25,633 --> 00:20:26,675
Why the bath?

424
00:20:26,675 --> 00:20:28,800
Hypnosis gave me
a nose picker.

425
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,800
Smells set off
hallucinations.

426
00:20:30,834 --> 00:20:32,834
Sensory deprivation

427
00:20:32,866 --> 00:20:35,533
Should get the brain into
an alpha-Theta phase.

428
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,233
<i>Didn't you see
altered states?</i>

429
00:20:37,266 --> 00:20:39,700
I don't think i was even
born when that movie was out.

430
00:20:39,734 --> 00:20:41,425
Well, then you're
too young to be a doctor.

431
00:20:41,425 --> 00:20:43,100
That movie was released
in 1980.

432
00:20:43,133 --> 00:20:44,367
That was 28 years ago.

433
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,800
No, it wasn't.
Shut up.

434
00:20:45,834 --> 00:20:47,700
Did you just forget
what year it is?

435
00:20:47,734 --> 00:20:50,800
No. I just remembered
how old i am.

436
00:20:52,362 --> 00:20:54,767
I need to give my brain
time to transition,

437
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,500
<i>So i can embrace
my inner monkey.</i>

438
00:20:56,533 --> 00:20:58,128
Or maybe i don't.

439
00:20:58,128 --> 00:20:59,734
Get me some physostigmine.

440
00:20:59,767 --> 00:21:00,941
It crosses
the blood-Brain barrier.

441
00:21:00,941 --> 00:21:02,550
And act like a nerve gas,
stop your heart-

442
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,050
You'll go to heaven
and be omniscient.

443
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:06,175
Good idea.
Not gonna happen.

444
00:21:06,925 --> 00:21:08,100
Don't do anything.

445
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:09,467
<i>Even if i escape,</i>

446
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,899
Eat a goat,
get shot by police.

447
00:21:11,933 --> 00:21:13,600
Wasn't born yet means
i won't be entertained

448
00:21:13,633 --> 00:21:14,800
By further reference.

449
00:21:24,266 --> 00:21:26,166
I didn't know
you rode the bus.

450
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,433
I used to drive home
after getting drunk.

451
00:21:29,467 --> 00:21:31,767
But some mothers
got mad-D.

452
00:21:33,233 --> 00:21:34,567
What are you doing here?

453
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,500
You weren't
on the bus with me.

454
00:21:36,533 --> 00:21:38,866
Then i guess
this isn't a memory.

455
00:21:38,899 --> 00:21:41,300
This is a fantasy.

456
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,425
If it's a fantasy,

457
00:21:43,425 --> 00:21:45,933
You'd be wearing... this.

458
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,925
You're convinced
your patient is dying,

459
00:21:50,925 --> 00:21:53,166
And you wanna waste
your time with a sex fantasy?

460
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,200
Don't blame me.
Blame my gender.

461
00:21:55,233 --> 00:21:56,722
Well, i'm not here
to indulge that.

462
00:21:56,722 --> 00:21:58,899
I'm here to help you
figure out what symptom you saw.

463
00:21:58,933 --> 00:22:00,768
Your patient was driving
the bus, so all you could see-

464
00:22:00,768 --> 00:22:02,550
Why can't you do both?

465
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,899
Your patient
was driving the bus

466
00:22:12,933 --> 00:22:15,500
So all you could see
was him sitting down,

467
00:22:15,533 --> 00:22:17,721
Most likely
facing forward.

468
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,734
From behind,
i saw his earlobes wiggling

469
00:22:27,767 --> 00:22:30,600
<i>Or his head bobbing.</i>

470
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:40,400
But not that.

471
00:22:40,433 --> 00:22:43,266
Could indicate
aortic insufficiency.

472
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,628
Marfan's syndrome.

473
00:22:44,628 --> 00:22:46,300
Or syphilis.

474
00:22:50,533 --> 00:22:53,999
What if his earlobes
were just drooping?

475
00:22:54,033 --> 00:22:55,500
Ehlers-Danlos?

476
00:22:55,533 --> 00:22:56,767
Or cutis laxa.

477
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,200
It's not fatal in adults.

478
00:23:04,433 --> 00:23:06,500
Yeah. He's an adult.
Very good point.

479
00:23:06,533 --> 00:23:07,734
Keep going.

480
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:15,233
I'm distracting you.

481
00:23:15,266 --> 00:23:17,166
No!

482
00:23:18,433 --> 00:23:20,300
Dance, woman!

483
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:21,675
You'd rather be
diagnosing.

484
00:23:21,675 --> 00:23:23,533
I screamed "no."

485
00:23:23,567 --> 00:23:26,233
And your own subconscious
ignored you.

486
00:23:26,266 --> 00:23:29,433
Because you'd rather fantasize
about finding symptoms.

487
00:23:29,467 --> 00:23:31,734
How screwed up is that?

488
00:23:31,767 --> 00:23:33,367
<i>Hey. Over here.</i>

489
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,233
Remember me?

490
00:23:35,266 --> 00:23:38,066
<i>I'm the sick guy.</i>

491
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,367
Tell me what i saw.

492
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,734
Was it the blood
dripping from my ear?

493
00:23:44,999 --> 00:23:46,667
That doesn't make sense.

494
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,166
'Cause your shirt
wasn't stained.

495
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,300
And because that was me.

496
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:57,467
<i>I could have had
a subtle hemiballismus,</i>

497
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,633
Indicating the early
stages of huntington's.

498
00:23:59,667 --> 00:24:02,367
Huntington's wouldn't
explain the abdominal pain.

499
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,667
It's only on the table because
we're thinking of thirteen.

500
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,600
A shuffling gait
could suggest parkinson's.

501
00:24:07,633 --> 00:24:09,816
Except there's no such thing
as shuffling sitting.

502
00:24:09,816 --> 00:24:13,333
<i>He moved when he helped
the old lady up the steps.</i>

503
00:24:16,033 --> 00:24:17,133
Who are you?

504
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:18,550
I'm the answer.

505
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:20,834
Look.

506
00:24:20,866 --> 00:24:22,767
At what?

507
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,300
<i>Here.</i>

508
00:24:38,533 --> 00:24:39,667
You were right.

509
00:24:44,999 --> 00:24:45,999
Help him up.

510
00:24:47,659 --> 00:24:49,284
I got it.
It's parkinson's.

511
00:24:49,284 --> 00:24:51,433
House, your ear.
Start him on levodopa.

512
00:24:51,467 --> 00:24:53,100
You should sit down.

513
00:24:53,133 --> 00:24:55,200
<i>House!</i>

514
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,500
Get that out of my face.

515
00:25:09,533 --> 00:25:11,667
Welcome back.

516
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,800
I'm nurse dickerson.

517
00:25:12,834 --> 00:25:14,112
I don't need your name.

518
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:15,238
And i got your profession

519
00:25:15,238 --> 00:25:18,565
From your super-Competent
technique of melting my retinas.

520
00:25:18,565 --> 00:25:20,600
<i>Verbal faculties
seem to be intact.</i>

521
00:25:20,633 --> 00:25:21,834
Do you remember
passing out?

522
00:25:21,866 --> 00:25:24,767
I remember puking
on cuddy's shoes.

523
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,966
Ow.

524
00:25:25,999 --> 00:25:28,333
Yeah. Skull fractures
tend to hurt.

525
00:25:28,367 --> 00:25:31,300
It would hurt a lot less if
you didn't swipe my pain pills.

526
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:32,800
Dr. Cuddy's orders.

527
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,425
<i>Wants me to regulate
the amount-</i>

528
00:25:34,425 --> 00:25:36,166
<i>Wait a second.
You brought muscle?</i>

529
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,834
Dr. Cuddy's orders.

530
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,200
Means i was wrong.

531
00:25:43,233 --> 00:25:45,933
My patient
doesn't have parkinson's.

532
00:25:45,966 --> 00:25:47,878
Cuddy knows
that's the only reason

533
00:25:47,878 --> 00:25:50,129
I wouldn't want to stay here
with my pain pills, porn,

534
00:25:50,129 --> 00:25:51,966
And you forever.

535
00:25:51,999 --> 00:25:55,222
Vomiting means your
brain injury is getting worse.

536
00:25:56,363 --> 00:25:57,753
House's skull fracture

537
00:25:57,753 --> 00:25:59,113
Extends all the way down
to his ear canal.

538
00:25:59,113 --> 00:26:00,800
House is being looked after.

539
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,800
Our other patient has jaundice,
low albumin, and no diagnosis.

540
00:26:03,834 --> 00:26:05,253
<i>Wilson's disease.
Thank you.</i>

541
00:26:05,253 --> 00:26:06,535
But wilson's wouldn't explain-

542
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:10,862
Foreman.

543
00:26:10,862 --> 00:26:12,500
How did you eliminate
parkinson's?

544
00:26:12,533 --> 00:26:13,784
The tests confirmed
the abdominal pain

545
00:26:13,784 --> 00:26:15,112
Was caused
by liver failure.

546
00:26:15,112 --> 00:26:18,133
I assume you've already ruled
out hepatitis and wilson's.

547
00:26:18,166 --> 00:26:20,362
You should really be resting.
Give him five minutes.

548
00:26:20,362 --> 00:26:21,899
<i>Brainstorming
a few possibilities</i>

549
00:26:21,933 --> 00:26:23,200
<i>Isn't going to explode
his brain.</i>

550
00:26:23,233 --> 00:26:24,433
And if she's wrong,

551
00:26:24,467 --> 00:26:26,316
That makes this phone call
that much more exciting.

552
00:26:26,316 --> 00:26:28,925
<i>What about hepatic fibrosis?
Can't be-His alk phos was normal.</i>

553
00:26:28,925 --> 00:26:31,285
Could be thyrotoxic
periodic paralysis.

554
00:26:31,285 --> 00:26:33,966
Did i mention this diagnosis
needs to make sense?

555
00:26:33,999 --> 00:26:35,425
<i>Why doesn't it make sense?</i>

556
00:26:35,425 --> 00:26:37,394
<i>Bus driver's asian,
his potassium slightly low.</i>

557
00:26:37,394 --> 00:26:39,600
If he got paralyzed
while driving the bus,

558
00:26:39,633 --> 00:26:41,567
Don't you think i would have
gotten off at the next stop?

559
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,393
<i>Not if the next stop</i>

560
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:44,600
Was at a 90-Degree angle
into an suv.

561
00:26:44,633 --> 00:26:46,815
The bus would have slowed.
I would have noti-

562
00:26:46,815 --> 00:26:47,738
Phone call's over.

563
00:26:47,738 --> 00:26:49,800
Tpp has all
the confirmed symptoms.

564
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,734
There's no downside
to testing.

565
00:26:51,767 --> 00:26:53,999
Genetic test
is too slow-

566
00:26:54,033 --> 00:26:56,133
Run the bagel test!

567
00:26:58,675 --> 00:26:59,866
How many more bagels
do i have to eat

568
00:26:59,899 --> 00:27:00,925
For this to work?

569
00:27:00,925 --> 00:27:02,363
High carbs
plus exercise

570
00:27:02,363 --> 00:27:04,100
Is the quickest way
to confirm tpp.

571
00:27:04,133 --> 00:27:05,999
I been on this
for half an hour.

572
00:27:06,033 --> 00:27:08,133
I'm not gonna
collapse again.

573
00:27:08,166 --> 00:27:09,866
Up the speed.
Keep eating.

574
00:27:13,866 --> 00:27:14,863
Yeah?

575
00:27:14,863 --> 00:27:17,999
<i>So the carbo-Loading
marathon isn't working.</i>

576
00:27:18,033 --> 00:27:19,866
<i>Stop looking around
suspiciously.</i>

577
00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:21,362
<i>To answer
your next two questions,</i>

578
00:27:21,362 --> 00:27:24,433
No, i am not there, and yes,
you are completely predictable.

579
00:27:24,467 --> 00:27:26,367
<i>If the test had worked,
you would have called</i>

580
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,133
<i>To put my delicate brain
at ease.</i>

581
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:32,533
<i>I told you not
to lock the door.</i>

582
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:35,033
Still wiping.

583
00:27:35,066 --> 00:27:37,233
Put the phone up
to bus driver's grill.

584
00:27:42,988 --> 00:27:44,581
<i>Who are you
talking to?</i>

585
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,500
My large colon.

586
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:50,612
Tpp is not consistent with your
patient's labored breathing.

587
00:27:50,612 --> 00:27:51,722
Patient has labored
breathing

588
00:27:51,722 --> 00:27:54,166
Because he's been on a treadmill
for the last 30 minutes.

589
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,800
<i>Did you take
my cell phone?</i>

590
00:27:56,812 --> 00:28:00,333
My large colon did.
I'm negotiating its release.

591
00:28:01,487 --> 00:28:03,567
<i>Help.
What's happening?</i>

592
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:07,834
<i>The test worked.
He collapsed.</i>

593
00:28:07,866 --> 00:28:09,533
You're half right.

594
00:28:09,567 --> 00:28:10,700
<i>He's wheezing, isn't he?</i>

595
00:28:12,175 --> 00:28:12,878
Yeah.

596
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,500
Can't wheeze without
moving your chest muscles.

597
00:28:15,533 --> 00:28:17,700
<i>This isn't tpp.
Then what is it?</i>

598
00:28:17,734 --> 00:28:20,999
How am i supposed to know?
I'm not there!

599
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,401
Right heart strain.
He's still not oxygenating.

600
00:28:27,434 --> 00:28:28,967
Must be a pulmonary
embolism.

601
00:28:30,801 --> 00:28:32,468
So why haven't you
pushed a vial of tpa?

602
00:28:32,501 --> 00:28:34,668
You let him back in?
I asked him back in.

603
00:28:34,701 --> 00:28:36,401
At the tail end of me
patiently explaining

604
00:28:36,434 --> 00:28:37,935
How you idiots were idiots-

605
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:40,534
We pushed tpa ten minutes ago.
That means it's not a clot.

606
00:28:40,568 --> 00:28:42,050
<i>Has to be a clot-
If he had a bagel</i>

607
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:43,987
<i>Stuck in his windpipe,
i'd have seen it on the echo.</i>

608
00:28:43,987 --> 00:28:45,468
Get him to the o.R.
To suck it out.

609
00:28:45,501 --> 00:28:47,300
Must have just screwed up
the intubation.

610
00:28:48,734 --> 00:28:49,967
Seal's good.

611
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,534
It's a clot, house.

612
00:28:52,568 --> 00:28:54,901
Wait, wait, wait.

613
00:28:54,935 --> 00:28:56,134
Look at his teeth.

614
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:57,868
<i>He's got shiny new caps.</i>

615
00:28:57,901 --> 00:28:59,967
He's had recent
dental surgery.

616
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,334
You can tell us what that means

617
00:29:01,367 --> 00:29:03,034
While we're rolling him
to the o.R.

618
00:29:08,901 --> 00:29:10,835
House!
House!

619
00:29:10,868 --> 00:29:12,362
House!

620
00:29:13,362 --> 00:29:14,675
????????????????

621
00:29:15,566 --> 00:29:16,862
<i>I didn't bring you back here</i>

622
00:29:16,862 --> 00:29:18,738
So you could stage a coup.

623
00:29:20,668 --> 00:29:21,901
<i>Listen to me.</i>

624
00:29:21,935 --> 00:29:24,668
Dental air drill pushed
an air bubble into his gums.

625
00:29:24,701 --> 00:29:26,134
<i>Dislodged while he's driving.</i>

626
00:29:26,167 --> 00:29:27,267
Caused a myoclonic jerk.

627
00:29:27,301 --> 00:29:28,534
That's what
i must have seen.

628
00:29:28,568 --> 00:29:31,701
Then it hit his spine,
his liver, now his lungs.

629
00:29:31,734 --> 00:29:33,167
Dr. Hadley, open the door!

630
00:29:33,201 --> 00:29:35,167
<i>I'm not plumping
his pillows here.</i>

631
00:29:35,201 --> 00:29:37,167
I'm putting him
in the trendelenburg position,

632
00:29:37,201 --> 00:29:38,878
Move the bubble
to the apex of his heart

633
00:29:38,878 --> 00:29:39,501
<i>So you can suck it out.</i>

634
00:29:39,534 --> 00:29:40,734
Now, get the damn syringe.

635
00:29:40,768 --> 00:29:43,167
I can't risk you
stabbing him in the heart

636
00:29:43,201 --> 00:29:44,935
<i>Looking for
an unconfirmed air bubble.</i>

637
00:29:44,967 --> 00:29:46,901
Stab him.
Dr. Hadley!

638
00:29:46,935 --> 00:29:48,434
See? She doesn't
even know your name.

639
00:29:48,468 --> 00:29:49,601
Stab his heart!

640
00:29:49,634 --> 00:29:52,568
Stats at 75-
Yes. He's suffocating.

641
00:29:52,601 --> 00:29:54,267
If you're wrong
- Shut up and make a decision.

642
00:29:54,301 --> 00:29:56,334
Keep standing there,
he's dead either way.

643
00:29:56,334 --> 00:29:58,112
????????????

644
00:29:58,112 --> 00:29:59,434
I'm sorry.

645
00:29:59,753 --> 00:30:00,675
??????

646
00:30:14,134 --> 00:30:15,100
Don't shoot!

647
00:30:15,134 --> 00:30:15,987
Get him to the o.R.

648
00:30:15,987 --> 00:30:17,253
The o2 sats.

649
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:20,468
It was an air bubble.

650
00:30:20,501 --> 00:30:21,801
He's okay.

651
00:30:27,234 --> 00:30:29,601
The other nurse always
used to tuck me in.

652
00:30:30,425 --> 00:30:33,468
I'll be on the couch...
with a shotgun in my lap.

653
00:30:33,501 --> 00:30:34,644
<i>Worrying about me?</i>

654
00:30:34,644 --> 00:30:37,267
Making sure you don't try
and make a limp for the border.

655
00:30:37,301 --> 00:30:38,534
<i>Get some sleep.</i>

656
00:31:05,967 --> 00:31:08,034
I'm not sleepy, mommy.

657
00:31:13,668 --> 00:31:14,967
Me neither.

658
00:31:16,967 --> 00:31:19,000
Who are you?

659
00:31:19,034 --> 00:31:21,334
And why are you stalking me?

660
00:31:21,367 --> 00:31:23,134
Technically,
you're stalking me.

661
00:31:23,167 --> 00:31:25,468
What is that?

662
00:31:28,801 --> 00:31:30,000
Mosquito?

663
00:31:30,034 --> 00:31:32,234
Maybe just a fly.

664
00:31:33,534 --> 00:31:35,175
In the ointment.

665
00:31:36,534 --> 00:31:39,701
So there's something wrong.

666
00:31:39,734 --> 00:31:41,701
There's some detail
i'm not noticing

667
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:43,634
That's spoiling
the big picture.

668
00:31:51,967 --> 00:31:54,734
Is this... significant?

669
00:31:54,768 --> 00:31:57,634
Or is this dream just going
in a different direction now?

670
00:31:57,668 --> 00:31:59,601
I guess that depends.

671
00:31:59,634 --> 00:32:02,267
What are you going
to do with that?

672
00:32:06,234 --> 00:32:08,401
I have to tie this
around you.

673
00:32:27,034 --> 00:32:29,301
I'm cold.

674
00:32:29,334 --> 00:32:31,175
Stay with me.

675
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,935
Why did i say that?

676
00:32:55,675 --> 00:32:56,300
Hey.

677
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,737
Oh, go away.

678
00:32:58,601 --> 00:32:59,816
It's not over.

679
00:33:01,201 --> 00:33:02,835
I saved the wrong person.

680
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,033
This wasn't just
a dream or a fantasy

681
00:33:11,066 --> 00:33:13,299
Or a drug-Induced
trip to wonderland.

682
00:33:13,332 --> 00:33:15,232
So the bus driver
with the air bubble's

683
00:33:15,265 --> 00:33:16,432
Just a coincidence?

684
00:33:16,466 --> 00:33:17,866
No. I got
the causation flipped.

685
00:33:17,899 --> 00:33:19,910
Bubble didn't cause
the crash.

686
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:21,316
Crash caused
the bubble to dislodge.

687
00:33:21,316 --> 00:33:23,675
There was
no myoclonic jerk.

688
00:33:23,675 --> 00:33:25,675
I saw something else
in someone else.

689
00:33:25,675 --> 00:33:26,925
You're not leaving.

690
00:33:26,925 --> 00:33:29,425
What's the most dangerous
thing a patient could do

691
00:33:29,425 --> 00:33:32,112
When his brain is on
the brink of herniating?

692
00:33:32,112 --> 00:33:34,238
Elevated heart rate, bp-

693
00:33:34,238 --> 00:33:36,675
Which is exactly why
you need to stop.

694
00:33:37,125 --> 00:33:38,472
Instead of sleeping,

695
00:33:38,472 --> 00:33:39,816
I'm going to be pacing
around this apartment,

696
00:33:39,816 --> 00:33:41,050
Trying to decipher
those visions.

697
00:33:41,083 --> 00:33:42,883
Why does this matter
so much?

698
00:33:42,916 --> 00:33:45,738
I don't know.
Heart rate?

699
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,150
127.

700
00:33:48,183 --> 00:33:49,850
Bp?

701
00:33:50,503 --> 00:33:52,300
Contextual memory.

702
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,878
I need to get back on that bus
with all 31 passengers

703
00:33:54,878 --> 00:33:56,644
To remember
who and what i saw.

704
00:33:56,677 --> 00:33:58,043
I'm not gonna call in
crash victims

705
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:00,237
Because
you've gone insane.

706
00:34:01,043 --> 00:34:03,978
Maybe i don't need
the actual victims.

707
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:06,077
Who's playing
anne mckeehan?

708
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,911
Right here.

709
00:34:07,944 --> 00:34:10,878
<i>Jane doe number two
from princeton general.</i>

710
00:34:10,911 --> 00:34:12,811
Right here.
You too, that's right.

711
00:34:12,844 --> 00:34:14,677
Goth kid.

712
00:34:14,711 --> 00:34:17,177
Yeah. At the back
on the right.

713
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:19,777
Yeah. Here.

714
00:34:19,811 --> 00:34:21,611
Okay.

715
00:34:21,644 --> 00:34:24,477
<i>You think that staring
at pictures on our shirts</i>

716
00:34:24,511 --> 00:34:26,544
Is gonna be more effective
than hypnosis?

717
00:34:26,577 --> 00:34:28,611
Well, if you'd only
stop talking,

718
00:34:28,644 --> 00:34:31,010
<i>The reenactment could stimulate
activity in my hippocampus</i>

719
00:34:31,043 --> 00:34:32,844
And parahippocampal cortex.

720
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:34,300
<i>How long do we
have to sit here</i>

721
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,611
Before you are stimulated?

722
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,811
Stop staring
at my breasts.

723
00:34:40,844 --> 00:34:44,362
And don't say,
"or lack thereof."

724
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:49,010
You okay?

725
00:34:57,043 --> 00:34:58,644
What do you see?

726
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:02,544
Just... slipped away.

727
00:35:03,711 --> 00:35:05,110
Is that vicodin?

728
00:35:05,143 --> 00:35:08,863
No. Just a little
memory pick-Me-Up.

729
00:35:10,277 --> 00:35:11,410
Physostigmine.

730
00:35:11,444 --> 00:35:12,711
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

731
00:35:12,744 --> 00:35:15,711
Alzheimer drugs will make
your brain go into overdrive.

732
00:35:15,744 --> 00:35:17,043
That's the point.

733
00:35:17,077 --> 00:35:18,911
It'll speed up
my neuronal firing,

734
00:35:18,944 --> 00:35:20,711
Turn up the voltage
on my memory.

735
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:22,077
<i>And blow out your heart.</i>

736
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,410
How many did you take?

737
00:35:23,444 --> 00:35:25,113
Just now,
or including the ones

738
00:35:25,113 --> 00:35:26,550
I took on the ride over?

739
00:35:30,813 --> 00:35:32,988
<i>House, this isn't worth...</i>

740
00:35:40,062 --> 00:35:41,143
<i>House?</i>

741
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:47,644
Why are you here?

742
00:35:47,677 --> 00:35:50,244
You believe in reason
above all else.

743
00:35:50,277 --> 00:35:51,777
There must be a reason.

744
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,377
You have something
to tell me.

745
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:55,944
Yes.

746
00:35:55,978 --> 00:35:57,577
Who am i?

747
00:35:57,611 --> 00:35:59,244
That's asking, not telling.

748
00:35:59,277 --> 00:36:00,744
Who are you?

749
00:36:00,777 --> 00:36:02,844
You know who i am.

750
00:36:02,878 --> 00:36:05,811
If i did,
i'd be passed out in bed

751
00:36:05,844 --> 00:36:07,611
Instead of oding
on physostigmine

752
00:36:07,644 --> 00:36:09,677
On the 6th street cross-Town.

753
00:36:09,711 --> 00:36:12,644
What's my necklace
made of?

754
00:36:16,344 --> 00:36:17,410
Resin.

755
00:36:17,444 --> 00:36:18,777
Who am i?

756
00:36:18,811 --> 00:36:20,550
I don't know.

757
00:36:21,978 --> 00:36:23,744
Why the guessing game?

758
00:36:23,777 --> 00:36:26,444
Because you don't know
the answer.

759
00:36:26,477 --> 00:36:28,444
If i don't, you don't.

760
00:36:30,444 --> 00:36:32,344
You know the clues.

761
00:36:32,377 --> 00:36:35,677
I know what's bugging
your subconscious.

762
00:36:35,711 --> 00:36:37,711
What's my necklace
made of?

763
00:36:43,978 --> 00:36:46,344
No.

764
00:36:46,377 --> 00:36:48,677
Who am i?

765
00:36:51,077 --> 00:36:54,177
Doesn't make sense.

766
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:56,310
What's my necklace made of?

767
00:37:02,377 --> 00:37:03,844
Amber.

768
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:05,244
I have to...
tie this around you.

769
00:39:11,811 --> 00:39:14,644
I'm cold.

770
00:39:14,677 --> 00:39:16,244
Stay with me.

771
00:39:17,577 --> 00:39:19,410
Just stay with me.

772
00:40:16,711 --> 00:40:18,862
Sir, are you
all right?

773
00:40:20,277 --> 00:40:21,611
Are you all right?

774
00:40:22,611 --> 00:40:24,577
Are you injured
anywhere?

775
00:40:33,577 --> 00:40:35,077
They'll take care of you
over there.

776
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:37,511
They'll take care
of you over there.

777
00:41:28,477 --> 00:41:29,911
He's coming out of it.

778
00:41:29,944 --> 00:41:31,110
Strong pulse.

779
00:41:31,143 --> 00:41:33,769
You idiot!
Your heart stopped.

780
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:36,477
Amber.

781
00:41:37,644 --> 00:41:38,878
What?

782
00:41:38,911 --> 00:41:41,377
Amber.

783
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:43,544
It was amber.

784
00:41:46,544 --> 00:41:48,210
She was on the bus.

785
00:41:48,244 --> 00:41:49,777
You almost kill yourself,

786
00:41:49,811 --> 00:41:51,844
And all we're getting
is drug-Induced fantasies.

787
00:41:51,878 --> 00:41:54,110
Have you spoken to her?

788
00:41:54,143 --> 00:41:58,644
She's probably working.
She's-She's been on-Call.

789
00:41:58,677 --> 00:42:01,477
I called her...

790
00:42:01,511 --> 00:42:03,611
She didn't call-

791
00:42:06,377 --> 00:42:08,043
I- I-

792
00:42:08,077 --> 00:42:09,477
How could she...

793
00:42:09,511 --> 00:42:11,010
I don't know.

794
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:16,177
Jane doe number two.

795
00:42:20,844 --> 00:42:23,477
"Female, late 20s,
kidney damage."

796
00:42:23,511 --> 00:42:26,456
Does amber have a birthmark
on her right shoulder blade?

797
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:34,577
She was on the bus with me.

798
00:42:38,143 --> 00:42:40,112
She's the one who's dying.

799
00:42:40,112 --> 00:42:45,112
