(CHILDREN CHATTERING)

2
00:00:07,307 --> 00:00:13,007
Jasper, hold still.
Stop squirming, hold still.

3
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:14,410
What did he do now?

4
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:17,575
He got in another fight
and I can't get his nose
to stop bleeding.

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,949
You have to apply
much more pressure than that.

6
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,181
(COUGHS)

7
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:23,586
You had to do this today.

8
00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:26,420
I got office hours,
I'm supposed to have dinner
with the Dean.

9
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:28,518
You just can't lash out
whenever you get angry.

10
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:30,187
He said I smelled like
a monkey.

11
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:32,060
Well, you do. You can't
refuse to take a bath

12
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:34,726
and then hit kids
who tell you
that you smell. Damn.

13
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:36,359
Don't you think
we should call 911?

14
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:39,530
This isn't his first
nosebleed. He'll be fine.

15
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:42,439
Daddy!
Hey! Lucy Goosey!

16
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:43,737
I'm playing doctor.

17
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,802
So am I. Can you
go back and play?

18
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:48,736
(GROANS)

19
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:49,904
When was this fight?

20
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:52,645
Over ten minutes ago.

21
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,346
I feel dizzy.

22
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:55,649
Maybe you should
make that call.

23
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,349
Okay.

24
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:58,857
Daddy, look, I can help.

25
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:01,689
No, no, that's great, honey.
Can you just please
leave Daddy alone?

26
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:05,993
TEACHER: One of my kids
is bleeding profusely
from the nose. Please hurry.

27
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:09,695
They're sending an ambulance.

(SIGHS)

29
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:18,102
Call them back. He'll be fine.

30
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:20,169
How you feeling, bud?
You light-headed?

31
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,338
Lucy.

00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:24,207
Oh, my God.

34
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:28,351
Lucy? Are you okay?
Lucy? Lucy?

35
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:31,154
Lucy? Lucy, are you okay?

36
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:34,159
Lucy! Lucy!

37
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:15,464
Oh, for God's sake.

38
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:17,666
Stop. Don't move.

39
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:22,265
The way the soft evening
light catches your eyes.

40
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:24,333
The gentle caress of dusk
on your hair

41
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,311
as you turn around
and leave my office
without giving me that file.

42
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,904
Restrictive pericarditis.

43
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,142
Boring.

44
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:31,240
She's in kindergarten.

45
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:34,286
Less boring. Or Grandma's
been held back a few years.

46
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:36,379
It's calcified
and she's hypertensive.

47
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:37,616
Better get her into surgery.

48
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,317
She already is in surgery.

49
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:41,519
Tricky procedure.
It's gonna take all night.

50
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:43,323
Sleep tight.

51
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:46,297
No congenital defects,
no health problems,

52
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:48,334
but her heart is
strangling itself.

53
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:50,835
Fascinating.
Since the pathology
on the pericardium

54
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:52,838
won't be back
until after they remove it.

55
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:57,036
Get started on her blood.
You can test for
viral infections, bacterial...

56
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,975
Round up the usual suspects.

57
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:02,344
Amyloidosis, sarcoidosis,
hemochromatosis.

58
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:04,610
Heck, go wild.
Do all the -osises.

59
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,208
All taken care of.
Sleep tight.

60
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:17,989
FOREMAN: This thing is already
all around her heart.

61
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:20,032
It gets into the muscle,
she's dead.

62
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,930
Best bet's Coxsackie virus,

63
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,231
Parvovirus B19, CMV.

64
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:27,569
Bacterial infection's
more likely to turn
constrictive. It could be TB.

65
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,838
Right, forgot about the part
where she did
time in a Russian gulag.

66
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:33,242
Her hematocrit's elevated.

67
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,575
A few extra red blood cells
means nothing.

68
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:35,944
She's probably
just dehydrated.

69
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:38,575
Yes, and I could assume
three or four things
to fit my theory, too.

70
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:40,551
She's sick!
She obviously hasn't
been drinking enough...

71
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,144
Enough!

72
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:46,981
I take it you two
aren't sleeping
together anymore?

73
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,085
We do what House said,
we test for everything.

74
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:52,689
Good, then I can go home.

75
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:54,960
Since when does
we not include you?

76
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:56,763
Well, House is gonna
call us idiots, anyway.

77
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:59,828
Might as well be
a well-rested idiot.

78
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:04,540
You guys are idiots.

79
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:08,274
Why? Because we stayed up
all night doing exactly
what you told us to do?

80
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:11,374
No, because you stayed up
all night doing exactly
what I told you to do

81
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:12,475
and have nothing
to show for it.

82
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,520
We eliminated dozens
of wrong answers.

83
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:18,455
I asked you what two plus two
equals and a day later
you tell me, "Not 25."

84
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:20,458
Pathology report
just got filed.

85
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:23,017
They found granulomas
in Lucy's pericardium.

86
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,927
Indicates a fungal infection.

87
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:26,956
Nice work.

88
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:28,159
He went home.

89
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:31,932
Work smart, not hard.

90
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:36,073
Find out which fungus.
Biopsy a lymph node.

91
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:38,372
Take employee of the month
with you.

92
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:41,277
I would rather Foreman...
I know.

93
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:49,882
I don't want any more shots.

94
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,685
I don't want any more shots.

95
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:53,692
Jasper.

96
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,728
Look at me, Goosey.
Squeeze my hand, okay?

97
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,821
This will tell us why
you're sick, so that
we can make you all better.

98
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:00,795
Where would she pick up
a fungus?

99
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:04,098
Anywhere moist. Around a pool,
locker room, public shower...

100
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,967
She doesn't have any gym
or swim classes.

101
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,200
She doesn't even like to play
with kids outside.

102
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:11,505
You haven't taken any trips?
Gone anywhere new?

103
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:14,740
It's been hard to get away
since their mom...

104
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,406
Our mom is dead.

105
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:22,145
I'm sorry.
Last year. Brain cancer.

106
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:27,092
You're gonna stick that thing
in her arm?

107
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,593
Cool!

108
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,994
The cool part is
your sister
won't feel a thing.

109
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,502
Nice necklace.

110
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:44,304
Thanks.
You like video games?

111
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:45,969
Love them.

112
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:51,008
That should do it. You okay?

113
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,018
I want my bunny.

114
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:02,022
Are you being silly?

115
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,393
I didn't know
which one to take.

116
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:08,263
What do you mean?

117
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:09,995
What's happening?

118
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:15,373
So. What does
the double vision tell us?

119
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:18,001
Slit lamp revealed
the eye's anterior chamber
is swollen.

120
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:20,773
Uveitis. Means it's not
a post-op effect
and it's not neurological.

121
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:23,941
It's not fungal, either.
Lymph node biopsy was clean.

122
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:25,244
So, we're back to square one.

123
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:27,650
One and a half.
We've eliminated
two more conditions.

124
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,450
Yes. Two plus two
doesn't equal 12 or 16,
either.

125
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:33,515
Vision issues plus
screwy heart equals
some type of autoimmune.

126
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:36,027
Lupus and Kawasaki's
are the most common
in a six-year-old.

127
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:39,826
Yeah, tough to find
a six-year-old who doesn't
have Lupus or Kawasaki's...

128
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,231
Did you look at her knees?

129
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:46,900
Those knobby things
in the middle of her legs.
Any scars or scabs?

130
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:47,962
What does that
have to do with...

131
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,770
Well, most six-year-olds
hurt themselves a lot.

132
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,608
Crash their bikes,
climb trees, bungee jump...

133
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:55,613
Dad says she doesn't like
to run around outside.

134
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:57,478
'Cause running around
outside hurts.

135
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,812
She didn't mention anything...

136
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:03,652
Most six-year-olds are
not familiar with the phrase,
"My joints feel inflamed."

137
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:06,248
So, two plus two equals...

138
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:08,259
Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.

139
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:11,854
We're checking her ANA
to confirm and giving her
steroids to fix her vision.

140
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:15,259
Some idiot gave me two tickets
for a play tonight.

141
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:18,834
Saved his life.
Apparently worth $186.

142
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,437
Sorry, had to take a leak.

143
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:23,737
Oh, I didn't know
you were seeing a patient.

144
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,005
It's an exam room.
What did you think
I was doing?

145
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:28,046
What you usually do.
Hiding from Cuddy.

146
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,140
Well, it'd be stupid
to do it in here.
There's a patient in here.

147
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:32,411
You been drinking more?

148
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:33,850
No, I haven't.

149
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,582
Guy's peeing all the time.
Play. Interested?

150
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:38,214
Sure. You want me
to pick you up?

151
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,486
Well, I'm not going.
You said two tickets.

152
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,522
You thought this was a date?

153
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:44,587
Any other symptoms?

154
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:45,790
My stomach hurts.

155
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:48,356
I have back pain
and muscle aches,

156
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:52,200
I feel dizzy and I have
trouble concentrating
sometimes in class.

157
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:53,761
I really should...

158
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,205
You want the tickets or not?

159
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,076
Why don't you
want to go with me?
It's a play.

160
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:03,037
Dudes only go to plays
if they're dragged by women
they're hoping to see naked.

161
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:04,707
So, why are you
giving them to me?

162
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:07,252
Maybe there's someone
you wanna see naked.

163
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:08,513
(EXHALES)

164
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:10,747
All right.

165
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,315
(DOOR CLOSES)

166
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:14,416
Any fever?
No.

167
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,291
Anything in your pee
other than pee?

168
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:17,590
No.

169
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,994
I'm going to need
a urine sample.

170
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:20,657
No!

171
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,462
Yeah, that last one
wasn't a question.

172
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:25,333
You might have diabetes...
I can't pee in public.

173
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:27,304
We have bathrooms.

174
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:33,177
I can't pee
in public bathrooms.

175
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:35,907
Where can you pee?

176
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,815
I only live
a few miles from here.

177
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:42,181
I thought arthritis
was for old people.

178
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:45,019
JRA is an autoimmune disease.

179
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:46,683
Her body's attacking itself,

180
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:50,661
causing inflammation
in the joints,
her eyes, and her heart.

181
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:51,957
Is it treatable?

182
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:55,626
It can be crippling,
but it can also go into
complete remission.

183
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,862
Well, the good thing is
we caught it early.

184
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:00,633
Gives her the best chance
to have a positive outcome.

185
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,231
Dad.

186
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:03,536
Don't get up, Goosey.

187
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,705
Your stitches.

(MUMBLING)

189
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,052
(GASPING)

190
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,001
She's having a stroke.

191
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:42,280
The stroke was caused
by a clot in her
middle cerebral artery.

192
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:43,508
Started her on tPA.

193
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,744
Should dissolve the clot
and hopefully
prevent brain damage,

194
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:48,412
but we won't know
for sure until she regains
consciousness.

195
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:50,512
Or she has another stroke.

196
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,526
Arthritis, heart disease.
Why can't this kid
act her age?

197
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,620
JRA doesn't affect the blood.
That means the clot's
a symptom of something else.

198
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,164
It's a symptom of
polycythemia.

199
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:02,325
She's fully hydrated
and her blood's still
thicker than pancake batter.

200
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:04,096
Well, thick blood
explains the stroke.

201
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,797
It could also have caused
an autoimmune response,

202
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:08,169
which would explain
the JRA kicking into gear.

203
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,571
But what explains
the thick blood?

204
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:12,270
Lack of oxygen forces the body
to overproduce red cells.

205
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:13,744
What explains
the lack of oxygen?

206
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:15,872
Carbon monoxide fumes,
cigarette smoke.

207
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,506
I doubt our patient's
a smoker.

208
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,574
Dad could be.
He's not.

209
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,449
He says he's not.
Hey!

210
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:23,885
Don't make me turn the hose
on you two.

211
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,149
Chase is right.

212
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:29,126
You two go check the house,
see if Dad's a closet
Marlboro Man.

213
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:30,526
You're intentionally
punishing us.

214
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:33,429
By making you do your job?
Does seem kind of cruel,
doesn't it?

215
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:35,660
Take along a carbon monoxide
detector to check for leaks,

216
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:39,330
and, you, start her
on hydroxyurea to control her
red blood cell production.

217
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,339
Dig out a Merck Manual,
Medieval edition.

218
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:44,968
Tell you how to drain
a pint or two
so she doesn't clot again.

219
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,048
Dr. Cameron!

220
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:59,219
I got you flowers
for helping my sister.

221
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,759
That's so sweet.

222
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,317
Does your dad know
you're down here?

223
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:04,556
Yes.

224
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:10,601
"Congratulations
on your bundle of joy."

225
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,662
Something you forgot
to tell me?

226
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:16,139
You should take these back
to where you found them.

227
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,675
Okay.
Excuse me?

228
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:19,108
Can you make sure
these flowers

229
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,839
and this kid both get back
to where they belong?

230
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:21,937
Sure.

231
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,744
Thanks.
Let's go. Come on.

232
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,580
Wait.

233
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,331
DERAN: So, you're just
draining blood from her?

234
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,070
You're not testing it?
You're not fixing it?

235
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:55,136
Your daughter's
vascular system is
engorged with blood.

236
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,183
Draining some reduces
the chances of another stroke.

237
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,583
We're also starting her
on a drug that suppresses
the production of red cells

238
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:04,020
so we don't have to
keep doing this.

239
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,582
Good chance
she'll make a full recovery.

240
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,218
She hasn't spoken yet.

241
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,320
Give her time.

242
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:17,430
This your boy?

243
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:20,336
Where have you been?
Exploring. See ya.

244
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:21,935
Thank you.

245
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:24,271
You know you can't just
run off without telling me.

246
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:26,937

Why did you take the flower?

253
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:44,693
Why did you kiss him?
He did something sweet.

254
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,197
He stole flowers.

255
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,630
He's eight.

256
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,062
You're trying to
make me jealous.

00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:55,005
Yeah, I want you to
profess your love for me.
Oh, wait.

258
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:58,908
You already did that
and it caused me
to end our relationship.

259
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:03,873
You're enabling a thief
and a delinquent!

260

a parent conference...

Oh, I know, I know.

It's a crush. It's harmless.

263
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:19,289
It's never harmless.
So I'm learning.

We snipe at each other?

I'm looking for a vent.

of CO sources down there.

equal abuse.

his wife passed away
last year, he could easily
be taking it out on the kids.

284

Or she had a nosebleed
and grabbed a t-shirt.

She's so ashamed of
a nosebleed

286
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,785
she has to hide the evidence
in a vent under her bed?

287
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:50,720
She's socially isolated,
the brother's always in
trouble, it's classic signs.

288

But no physical signs.

no bruises at all.

What if it's sexual?

291
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:01,162
We should call
Social Services.

292
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:03,727
Well, this sucks.

293
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:06,103
Either it's abuse,
or it's not abuse,

294
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:08,537
which means either
it's a symptom or it's
completely irrelevant.

295
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:12,236
Either way,
we got to waste half a day
figuring out which.

296
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,511
Full physical exam.

297
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,515
Look for bruises we may have
missed, check her mouth
and do a vaginal exam.

298
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:21,144
We can't do a vaginal exam
on a six-year-old without
the dad's consent.

299
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,018
And if he's abusing her,
he'll never say yes.

300
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,922
"Never" is just "reven"
spelled backwards.

Have you been abusing
your daughter?

302
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,230
What? Why would you...

00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:43,130
We found this
hidden in a vent
under her bed.

00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:52,784
I don't know
anything about this.
Maybe she had a bloody nose?

We need to examine her
for abuse.

00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,945
You can't really think I...
Maybe you,
maybe the school bully

307
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:58,148
maybe the creepy neighbor.

308
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:00,953
I'm guessing you're not
paying as much attention
as you should be.

309
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:02,618
Do you even know
where your son is right now?

310
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:05,630
Yeah, he was here just...
Here a minute ago.

00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:09,827
She isn't being abused.

312
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:12,166
Unfortunately, that answer
doesn't help me.

313
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:13,363
If you have abused her,

314
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,669
you're obviously
gonna lie about it.
I'm not lying!

315
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:17,538
We need to do a vaginal exam.
No.

316
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:18,667
She may be dying,

317
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:21,872
she still can't talk
and you're gonna waste
your time with this?

318
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:25,713
Either you consent and
we waste a few hours doing
the exam, or you refuse

319
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:29,618
and I call Social Services
and they waste three days
doing an investigation

320
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:32,521
which ends with them
doing the exam anyway.

Okay. I'm gonna look inside
your mouth. Open wide.

and your back next, okay?

323
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:56,209
I know you can't talk,
so stop me if you get scared.

324
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:08,017
Before you came here,
did anyone hurt you?
Make you bleed?

325
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:12,559
I need to look
in your vagina now.
Do you understand?

326
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:15,031
I'm a doctor, so it's okay.
All right?

327
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,728
Bend your knees,
keep your ankles together

328
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:20,601
and just let your knees fall
to the side, okay?

329
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,909
Oh, my God.

330
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,608
She has cuts
all over her genital area,
like slices.

331
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:32,547
Some are almost healed,
but some are new.

332
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,051
She could be doing it
to herself.

333
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,586
She's a little young
to be cutting.

334
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:37,622
She's a little young
for a stroke.

335
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:40,852
Depression accounts for
the cuts, molestation accounts
for the depression.

336
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:43,520
But do the cuts
account for all that blood?
They weren't deep enough.

337
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:46,223
So she's getting cut,
but that's not
the source of the blood?

338
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:48,630
The other obvious source
is forcible penetration.

339
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,361
The obvious source
of the blood, not the cuts.

340
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,597
There was no tearing,
there's no evidence at all.

341
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:55,970
So we have no explanation
for the cuts or the blood.

342
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,774
Where is he?

343
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:00,407
What if our original
assumption was wrong?

344
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:01,571
Meaning what?

345
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:04,810
We found a t-shirt
covered with blood hidden
in a heating vent.

346
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:06,316
How do we know it's even hers?

347
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:07,716
Her dad identified it.

348
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:10,218
Not the shirt, the blood.

349
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,364
Are those
the urine test results?

350
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,127
Yes.
And...

351
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:24,635
I'm going to ask you
for some blood.
Why?

352
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:28,264
To see if your answer will be,
"I can't bleed in public."

353
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:30,698
This wasn't your urine,
was it?

354
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,403
Why would I give you
someone else's urine?

355
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:34,912
The usual reason is
because you're on steroids.

356
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,242
I'm not an athlete.

357
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:39,913
Second favorite reason is
because you're on drugs.

358
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:41,543
I'm not.
I am.

359
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:46,080
Third favorite reason is
you have insurance but your
friend Eggs Benedict doesn't.

360
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:50,026
So, Eggs describes a list of
symptoms and you repeat them
to a doctor,

361
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:53,462
which is particularly stupid
because this is a free clinic.

362
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,490
Need you, now.

363
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,462
My work here is done.

364
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,802
Am I okay?

365
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:03,364
Is it diabetes?

366
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:05,205
No, you're pregnant.

367
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:15,249
Six-year-old abuse victim
and you haven't called
Social Services?

368
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,788
She might've been abused?
That's horrifying.

369
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:20,654
Why are you wearing
extra concealer
under your eyes?

370
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:23,923
The law's clear.
You suspect abuse,
you call the authorities.

371
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:27,625
You don't proceed as usual
while the possible abuser
sits by her bedside.

372
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:31,032
Dad consented to the exam
which means it's not the dad.

373
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:32,434
How late were you
out last night?

374
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,473
It's always the dad
and I don't have a curfew.

375
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,169
Panty hamster
get a spin on its wheel?

376
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:41,570
I went to a play.

377
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:45,378
House, you are going back
to your office.
You are picking up your phone,

378
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,715
calling Social Services
and you are reporting
suspected abuse.

379
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:50,379
Do you understand?

380
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:52,820
What play?

381
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,655
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

382
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:03,595
You're trying to have sex
with Cuddy.

383
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,597
Fries?
You took her to a play.

384
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:09,436
You only take women
to plays because...

385
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:13,740
No, you only take women
to plays for that reason.
That's your theory.

386
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:16,807
Okay. Then why did you
take her to a play?
She's a friend.

387
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,372
A friend with a squish mitten.

388
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,146
It is possible to have
a friend of the opposite sex
without...

389
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,744
Blasphemer!

390
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:25,756
She's not a friend
of the opposite sex,
she's a different species.

391
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:27,052
She's an administrator.

392
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,717
She's going to eat your head
after she's done.

393
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:30,659
Yes, I slept with her.

394
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:32,887
Seriously?
No.

395
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,258
Yes, you did.

396
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:39,868
Yes, I did.

397
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,035
Seriously?
No.

398
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,736
You've got a problem, House.

399
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:51,377
We just tested the blood
on Lucy's t-shirt,

400
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,748
it's full of
endometrial cells.

401
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:55,747
So it's not her blood.

402
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:57,686
We tested that, too. It is.

403
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,053
Your six-year-old patient?

404
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,057
It's menstrual blood.

405
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,223
She's started puberty.

406
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:16,436
How can someone start puberty
before they even start
the first grade?

407
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,275
She was in diapers
two years ago.

408
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,845
For some reason her body
has too much sex hormone.

409
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,640
It caused her
reproductive system
to get confused,

410
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:27,708
start operating prematurely.

411
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,846
We need to find out
the source of the hormones
and cut it off.

412
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:32,446
She's so young.

413
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:35,950
I haven't even

414
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:38,919
talked to her about sex.

415
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:42,094
I doubt she even knows
what a period is.

416
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:50,897
Girls talk to their moms
about that.

417
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,850
You're gonna be okay, Goosey.

418
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:04,145
I love you.

419
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:07,514
I

420
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:10,219
want

421
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,291
juice.

422
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:14,491
(GASPS)

423
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:21,228
She got her period
and didn't know what it was.

424
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:22,671
She was scared and confused.

425
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:25,232
A friend told her
to put a t-shirt
in her underwear.

426
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,834
When she started
growing pubic hair,

427
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:29,403
she snuck Daddy's razor
and tried to shave it off.

428
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:31,876
Apparently forgot to sneak
the shaving cream.

429
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,247
Tumor's most likely.

430
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:36,048
A pituitary adenoma
would send her
hormone level sky-high.

431
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:38,954
In Puerto Rico, in the '70s,
there was an epidemic
of kids growing breasts

432
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,958
because of estrogen
in the poultry.

433
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,995
If it was in the food,
it would be an epidemic.
We've got one kid.

434
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:47,395
She's six, she's tiny,
she lives on chicken fingers
and milk.

435
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:48,990
Dad doesn't look like
the type to read labels,

436
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:51,900
he's probably buying stuff
packed full of hormones.

437
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,370
Excellent argument.
It's a tumor.

438
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:58,432
There's all sorts of
environmental sources.
Pesticides, soy products.

439
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,604
Some shampoos
are basically a placenta
in a bottle.

440
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,945
If the tumor's not
in her brain, it's in her
reproductive tract.

441
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:06,574
Get an MRI.

442
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:08,380
Can I at least...
Waste your time?

443
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:11,081
Wouldn't recognize you
if you didn't.

444
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:20,560
Frontal cortex is clean,
moving caudally.

445
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:25,666
For the record,
Cameron's the one
who broke it off.

446
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,261
Not interested.

447
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:30,403
No masses in the hypothalamus.

448
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:32,343
I wanted more.

449
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:35,273
She didn't share my feelings.

450
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,975
I feel like
I'm in a similar position.

451
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,747
Pituitary's clean.

452
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:44,913
You're an idiot.

453
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,823
Either she's lying
or she's actually
emotionally detached.

454
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:49,952
Which one sounds more
like Cameron to you?

455
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:51,393
Neither.

456
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:53,431
You have to choose one.

457
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:59,798
FOREMAN: There's a bright spot
on her left ovary.

458
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:04,537
Looks like a solid tumor.

459
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:13,314
They printed my letter.

00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:16,843
You were right.

00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:19,152
Of course I was.
What are we talking about?

463
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:20,987
They printed my letter.
Great.

464
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:22,219
Cuddy.

465
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:24,629
You want to see her naked?
No, no, no.

466
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:27,256
She wants to see me naked.

467
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,500
She sent me flowers.

468
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,264
Just thanking you
for the play.

469
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:35,204
See, some people feel
an emotion called gratitude.

470
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:36,968
There's a card.
I suspected.

471
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:39,306
It explains how you knew
who they were from.

472
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:43,814
"Let's do it again.
Soon. XX, Lisa."

473
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:45,110
Xs are the kisses, right?

474
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:46,673
No, I think they're the hugs.

475
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:47,877
I think Os are the kisses.

476
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:50,444
No, no. The Xs are
definitely the kisses.

477
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:53,423
"Soon" is its own sentence.

478
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,950
I gotta go!

479
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:03,761
I'll miss you.
You were a good friend.

480
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,965
They printed my letter.

481
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,438
How was the play,
Mrs. Lincoln?

482
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,873
What's up with Wilson?

483
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:12,068
He's just a little freaked.

484
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:13,337
Why?

485
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,741
I sent him flowers.

486
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:28,289
Jasper, you're not
supposed to be up here.

487
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,885
Is that other doctor
your boyfriend?

488
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,554
No.

489
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:35,731
Your dad's probably looking
for you. He's got enough to
worry about right now.

490
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,461
Do you like him?

491
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,504
He's a friend.

00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:41,596
Do you like him, like him?

493
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,471
We should get you
back to your dad.

494
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:47,069
Let me put this down
and I'll take you there.

495
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:53,808
I could be your boyfriend.

496
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:58,015
I think that wouldn't be fair
to the girls your own age.

497
00:25:58,089 --> 00:25:59,920
He seems like a tool.

498
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,289
He's not. And that's rude.

499
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,328
I'm taking you back
to your father.

a reaction to the hydroxyurea.

515
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:56,407
We resect the tumor,
hormone levels go back to
normal, her symptoms go away.

516
00:26:56,481 --> 00:27:00,008
Great plan, except for
the fact that her tumor's
not a tumor.

517
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:01,814
It's a benign cyst.

that just leaves
an environmental source.

What?

It's just a question of
finding it.

encouraged him.

Well, I was a boy once.
I know how they think.

You didn't.

more than a coincidence

that could be caused by
a brain tumor

592

what killed their mom?

So did their mom's,
until it didn't.

597
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,148
It can't be genetic.
Mom had none
of the same symptoms.

598
00:30:58,223 --> 00:31:02,250
Yes, she did, if the symptoms
were pubic hair
and menstruation.

00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:04,659

If menstruation is
a symptom of brain cancer

600

then I should be

had other problems?

48 hours ago.

her body go haywire.

She gets one in her brain
or heart, she's dead.

626

No pressure, though.

627
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,374
Her mom was perfectly healthy
until she got cancer.

628
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,034
She had none of the symptoms
the kids have.

629
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,011
It's not genetic,
it's not environmental.

630
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,775
It's gotta be
a pituitary adenoma.

631
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:33,817
Yes! That would make
complete sense
if they had one.

632
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:38,652
Just because we haven't found
anything on the scan
doesn't mean it's not there.

633
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:41,549
We should remove
her pituitary gland.

Two siblings, same condition.

635
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:45,251
It's gotta be genetic
or environmental.

636
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,855
We add in the same time
and we're back to
just environmental.

637
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:50,992
Yes, and that would make
complete sense if there was
anything in her environment.

638
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:52,593
Just because we haven't
found anything yet...

639
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:57,437
She's been out of her
environment for four days
and she's still getting worse.

I'm getting
the father's consent.

641
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:03,680
No!

642
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:05,147
We have no evidence.

643
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:07,878
This is your process, House.

You asked us
what two plus two is.

We've eliminated every number
except for four.

646
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:19,657
She needs brain surgery.

647
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,032
The ovaries produce
sex hormones

648
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:26,627
in response to a signal
from the pituitary gland.

649
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:29,764
Since we know
the ovaries are fine,
the most likely cause...

650
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:34,369
"Most likely" means she
wants to root around inside
your little girl's brain

651
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:36,208
without any guarantee
that it'll work.

652
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,248
That's why she's holding off
on doing your son.

unfortunately we've ruled out
every other option.

any family in town.

They don't have one.

661
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:56,762
They go to after-school
daycare but none
of the other kids are sick.

662
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:57,994
Yet.

663
00:33:58,069 --> 00:34:00,663
It took your son twice as long
to develop symptoms
as your daughter.

664
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:02,137
Maybe the other kids
are just slow.

665
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,901
We wait
and your daughter may die.

666
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:05,340
She does this,
your daughter will need

667
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,503
hormone replacement therapy
for the rest of her life.

668
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:11,207
The treatments are extremely
effective. She should lead
a relatively normal life.

669
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:13,045
And isn't that
every parent's dream?

670
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:16,575
To have a kid grow up to be
relatively normal?

671
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:26,891
My husband died of
thyroid cancer that
metastasized to his brain.

672
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:30,490

this can be.

And I am telling you

You did not just play
the dead husband card.

677
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:53,719

a consent form that
I didn't want her to sign.

00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,537
How did you know?

681
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:10,300
Know what?

682
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:12,433
That the other kids
weren't sick?

683
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,841
You've been here
for four days.

684
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:15,401
I just...

685
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:18,777
I would have heard.

686
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:23,918
Right.

687
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:35,863
Do you have hair
on your special place?

688
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:37,662
Miss Janie!

689
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:40,864
Can I help you?

690
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:42,428
I'm a doctor.

691
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:45,499
Two of your kids are sick
and I need to know why.

692
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:47,703
You think they got sick here?

693
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:50,144
I think
you're dating their dad.

694
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,509
He told you?

695
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:56,644
No.

696
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:58,712
And I don't really care
why he didn't.

697
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:01,417
I just need to know
how often you go to their
house and what you bring.

698
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:04,757
I don't.
Shampoos, fancy soaps...

699
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:08,492
Kids get in your bag.
I've never been
to their house.

700
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:14,132
They just lost their mom
and we thought
it was too soon.

701
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:21,644
Why are you staring at me?

702
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:23,043
Lip wax?

703
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:27,015
I just had it done over lunch.

704
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:28,915
Mani-pedi?
No.

705
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,987
Just the wax.

706
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:36,223
Women get a wax
as a part of a whole
self-indulgent beauty ritual.

707
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:39,263
Pedicures, steam,
cucumber masks.

708
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:42,163
No one runs out at lunch
just to get a lip wax,

709
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:45,134
unless you woke up looking
like Yosemite Sam.

710
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,966

It's always the dad.

712
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:57,236
Excess facial hair in women.
It's a clear sign of
hormonal imbalance.

713
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:59,010
Exactly what
the little kiddies have.

714
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:01,551
Is there something wrong
at the daycare center?

715
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:04,645
There's something wrong
in your pants.

She's a lot younger
than I am. I

718
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:17,395
use a

719
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:19,359
male enhancement cream
to keep up with her.

720
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:20,631
What does this
have to do with...

721
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:22,138
Never occurred to you
to get a prescription

722
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:25,175
instead of some penis-pumper
loaded with testosterone?

723
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,642
I keep it at the gym.

724
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:29,305
I apply it daily in the shower
just like it says
on the bottle.

725
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:32,213
It's never been in my home,
it's obviously never been
near the kids.

726
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:33,272
But you have.

727
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:36,514
We've been through that,
I'm not a pervert
or a pedophile!

728

Thirty percent of our waste
is excreted through our skin.

729

after eating garlic.

Jack waters his beanstalk
every day for a week

732

he's oozing bean curd
out of his pores for a month.

733
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:55,871
Every time you gave the little
tykes a hug you gave them
a dose of testosterone.

734
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,899
Small for you, but more than
their little bodies
can handle.

735
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,969
So...

736
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,576
I did this to them?

737
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:09,944
Just holding their hands?

738
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:11,449
Uh-huh.

739
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:19,462
If I stop using it?

740
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:23,199
You'll be floppy,
they'll be fine.

741
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:28,761

Yeah, I think so.

Talk to Cuddy?
No, not yet.

748
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:59,461
I don't know what to say.

749
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:02,062
Just be straight with her.

750
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:04,369
I'm not sure what that is.

751
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:08,406
I can't stop
thinking about her.

752
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:11,708
In what way?

753
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:13,682
Maybe she's right. Maybe...

754
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:17,118
Maybe this is worth exploring.

755
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,057
Are you sure that she feels...

756
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:25,220
She sent me flowers.

757
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:27,453
How do I do this?

758
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:28,862
What do I say?

759
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:33,233
Cameron would tell you
to say how you feel.

760
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:35,169
Me? I'd get her drunk.

761
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:39,642
I'm not gonna say anything.

762
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:45,046
I'm just gonna
walk into her office
and I'm gonna kiss her.

763
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:51,352
That's a bold move.

764
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,986
Cuddy likes bold.

765
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:57,583
Yeah, you're right,
if you spoke, you'd just
say something stupid.

766
00:39:57,661 --> 00:40:01,119
Yeah, I mean I'll either
get a girlfriend or get fired.

767
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:10,300
Okay.

768
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:13,002
Yeah. Okay.

00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:17,378

a compelling argument.

took her to a play.

you do wanna march

Well, why can't it be

If that guy wasn't trying
so hard to keep up
with a woman half his age,
