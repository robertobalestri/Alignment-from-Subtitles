1
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,291
Previously on E.R...

2
00:00:05,361 --> 00:00:07,025
So you're a proponent
of a national health plan?

3
00:00:07,033 --> 00:00:10,916
If we had one, this guy would be home playing
with his kids instead of fighting for his life.

4
00:00:12,535 --> 00:00:13,514
That was gold.

5
00:00:13,527 --> 00:00:16,227
I want these two out of my O.R.--
Shirley, call security.

6
00:00:16,233 --> 00:00:18,318
- Nice working with you guys.
- Bovie...

7
00:00:18,482 --> 00:00:20,053
- Stand back!
- You want to hook up?

8
00:00:20,067 --> 00:00:22,107
- Hook up?
- Yeah, prep for the M&M.

9
00:00:22,117 --> 00:00:23,992
Thought I'd give you a head's up
before I kick your ass.

10
00:00:24,005 --> 00:00:27,090
- Uh, is, uh... is Tony there?
- I'm sorry, he's a little busy right now.

11
00:00:27,104 --> 00:00:29,612
- Nobody here goes to the doctor?
- Hell no. - Not me.

12
00:00:29,621 --> 00:00:34,228
I just don't know how to fix this.

13
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,522
Yo, Dr. K.

14
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,801
- Hey, what's up, guys?
- Oh, my God, he's so cute.

15
00:00:59,997 --> 00:01:00,923
Hi, Joe.

16
00:01:00,938 --> 00:01:03,083
Don't let the good looks fool you.
He's a tough one.

17
00:01:03,085 --> 00:01:05,470
- Takes after his mom, huh?
- Ain't that the truth.

18
00:01:05,485 --> 00:01:07,640
- Let me give you a hand, doc.
- Thanks.

19
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:11,690
Our babysitter couldn't make it again.
We finally decided to hire a nanny.

20
00:01:11,707 --> 00:01:14,880
My mom raised eight kids all by herself.
I don't know how she did it.

21
00:01:14,895 --> 00:01:16,943
She available?
So what about your S.B.O. guy.

22
00:01:16,946 --> 00:01:19,872
- Waiting on surgery.
- And your chemo boy in 4?

23
00:01:19,886 --> 00:01:22,850
Up to oncology about a half hour ago.
Who's this, the new chief of ER?

24
00:01:22,856 --> 00:01:24,900
Yep, training him so I can retire early.

25
00:01:24,915 --> 00:01:26,670
Good. We could use some
new blood around here.

26
00:01:26,676 --> 00:01:28,852
- I'm new.
- You're too old to be new, Gates.

27
00:01:29,907 --> 00:01:31,430
Excuse me, Dr. Weaver, hi.

28
00:01:31,445 --> 00:01:33,973
Courtney Brown, Channel 5.
Have you got a minute?

29
00:01:33,975 --> 00:01:35,410
Not really--
give me the half-inch, please.

30
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:38,572
The station loved you
and our segment that we did.

31
00:01:38,588 --> 00:01:40,580
They've given us a green
light to do some more.

32
00:01:40,918 --> 00:01:44,162
- Wow, that sounds cool.
- Yeah, I don't think so.

33
00:01:44,176 --> 00:01:47,040
I'm an ER doc, not a TV personality.

34
00:01:47,057 --> 00:01:49,391
That's exactly what we're looking for:
someone real.

35
00:01:49,405 --> 00:01:51,941
You'd be really great, Dr. Weaver.
That piece you did was so good.

36
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:54,010
You know what, why don't you take over.

37
00:01:54,027 --> 00:01:56,863
Pack all four quadrants
and Dawn can help you.

38
00:01:56,905 --> 00:01:59,030
GYN has a bed, but they can't take
the P.I.D. for two hours.

39
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:01,403
- Dr. Weaver, radiology on two.
- Sorry, I got to take this.

40
00:02:01,415 --> 00:02:03,632
Oh, I get it, you're swamped.
I'll try to buzz you later.

41
00:02:03,637 --> 00:02:06,470
- I think he has Abby's eyes.
- Yeah, and his dad's head.

42
00:02:06,487 --> 00:02:09,093
- Yeah.
- He'll grow into it.

43
00:02:11,925 --> 00:02:14,141
Could you guys keep an eye
on him for a minute?

44
00:02:14,156 --> 00:02:15,313
Yeah.

45
00:02:16,676 --> 00:02:17,683
Mr. Ames.

46
00:02:18,785 --> 00:02:19,721
Luka.

47
00:02:20,657 --> 00:02:23,451
Can I, uh...
Can I help you with something?

48
00:02:23,597 --> 00:02:28,062
No, no. Got a meeting
with Angela Gilliam upstairs.

49
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:32,653
About my appeal.

50
00:02:34,117 --> 00:02:35,850
- She didn't tell you?
- No, no.

51
00:02:36,107 --> 00:02:39,733
Yeah, need to copy
some of my hospital files.

52
00:02:40,275 --> 00:02:43,661
- You're appealing the case?
- Only if I have to.

53
00:02:44,356 --> 00:02:48,630
You know, a settlement would save the
hospital a lot of time and a lot of money.

54
00:02:49,576 --> 00:02:52,731
Look, this hasn't been
easy on any of us.

55
00:02:53,397 --> 00:02:56,251
Least of all you, but...

56
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:58,063
But what?

57
00:03:00,378 --> 00:03:04,100
Maybe it's time to move on,
put the past behind you.

58
00:03:04,778 --> 00:03:06,032
I couldn't agree more.

59
00:03:10,415 --> 00:03:12,132
I'm going to hop up the stairs.

60
00:03:12,786 --> 00:03:14,291
I'll see you around.

61
00:03:32,177 --> 00:03:36,170
I can smell 'em.
You can't, but I can.

62
00:03:36,548 --> 00:03:40,602
They're here now.
I can smell 'em; you can't smell 'em.

63
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:42,561
I can smell 'em...

64
00:04:14,807 --> 00:04:15,832
Hey.

65
00:04:16,646 --> 00:04:19,013
- Are those Hot Wheels?
- Want one?

66
00:04:19,028 --> 00:04:20,181
Yeah.

67
00:04:22,405 --> 00:04:25,083
I got lots of Hot Wheels, too.

68
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:28,001
- What is this one?
- I don't know.

69
00:04:28,178 --> 00:04:29,502
Number five.

70
00:04:33,725 --> 00:04:34,920
Get off the floor.

71
00:04:34,935 --> 00:04:37,390
- Come on, don't make me embarrass you.
- Mom, I'm racing!

72
00:04:37,408 --> 00:04:39,932
Get over here now.
Come on.

73
00:04:42,607 --> 00:04:43,982
Get out of the way, man!

74
00:04:44,005 --> 00:04:47,182
Fast food guy dumped some hot oil.
Third degree burns to his hands and wrists.

75
00:04:47,607 --> 00:04:49,263
Exam Three is open.

76
00:04:49,855 --> 00:04:54,433
You can't, but I can.
I can smell 'em.

77
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:17,272
Hey!

78
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:21,231
Maybe you haven't noticed, but
you got a few people waiting out here.

79
00:05:21,245 --> 00:05:24,812
You actually got any doctors working
back there? What is it, golf day?!

80
00:05:24,826 --> 00:05:26,110
Sir, please sit down.

81
00:05:26,128 --> 00:05:29,801
Don't "sir" me, bitch,
just let me see a damn doctor!

82
00:05:29,817 --> 00:05:31,663
Calm down, or I'll call security.

83
00:05:31,675 --> 00:05:34,541
Oh, oh, oh, call 'em--
go ahead, I'm right here.

84
00:05:37,345 --> 00:05:39,290
- What?
- Calm down now.

85
00:05:39,307 --> 00:05:41,663
You are not the only patient here, okay?

86
00:05:42,006 --> 00:05:43,551
Yeah, I can see that.

87
00:05:44,328 --> 00:05:45,610
I can see that.

88
00:05:46,505 --> 00:05:47,663
You sign in?

89
00:05:47,678 --> 00:05:50,462
Signed in what?
All I got's a little congestion.

90
00:05:51,205 --> 00:05:53,652
You think you morons can handle that?!

91
00:05:56,137 --> 00:05:57,401
Fill this out.

92
00:06:03,006 --> 00:06:05,970
If you sit down and shut up, I'll bring
you back here in a few minutes.

93
00:06:05,985 --> 00:06:08,181
I just got the flu, for God's sake.

94
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:11,473
I want to apologize in advance
for the smell in the break room.

95
00:06:11,476 --> 00:06:14,321
- Luka changed Joe's diaper in there.
- Wow, how bad is it?

96
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:17,013
- We've got a men's room, you know.
- It's not carrots, is it? I hate carrots.

97
00:06:17,015 --> 00:06:19,562
You know, I said I'm sorry.
My babysitter flaked.

98
00:06:19,577 --> 00:06:21,510
I feel bad enough dragging him in here.

99
00:06:21,526 --> 00:06:24,763
- Hey, has Radiology called back yet?
- Nah, I don't think so.

100
00:06:24,777 --> 00:06:28,583
Excuse me, I'm here
to see Dr. Luka Kovac.

101
00:06:33,956 --> 00:06:37,042
- How long you been congested?
- I don't know. Does it matter?

102
00:06:37,088 --> 00:06:39,611
No, I'm just making conversation.

103
00:06:40,996 --> 00:06:42,422
About a month or so.

104
00:06:42,448 --> 00:06:45,222
- All right, what do we got?
- Temp's 99.

105
00:06:45,597 --> 00:06:48,050
- U.R.I. symptoms.
- The flu.

106
00:06:49,446 --> 00:06:50,853
Deep breath for me, please.

107
00:06:51,207 --> 00:06:53,571
Get that damn thing off of me!
It's freezing!

108
00:06:53,586 --> 00:06:58,140
- I have to take a listen, sir.
- I told you asshole... it's the flu.

109
00:06:58,155 --> 00:07:02,181
Now just give me some antibiotics
or something, and let me out of here.

110
00:07:02,198 --> 00:07:06,493
Listen, Prince Charming, the quicker
we check you out, the quicker you can go.

111
00:07:06,766 --> 00:07:08,872
I need to check the oxygen in your blood.

112
00:07:09,176 --> 00:07:10,242
Part of the exam.

113
00:07:11,368 --> 00:07:13,491
- Omit that part.
- All right.

114
00:07:13,838 --> 00:07:19,332
Look, you have the flu, that's an easy fix.
Then you can go home.

115
00:07:19,698 --> 00:07:21,791
Believe me, I want you to go.

116
00:07:22,145 --> 00:07:23,672
I need you to go.

117
00:07:26,008 --> 00:07:27,803
Wow, Rio.

118
00:07:28,196 --> 00:07:32,102
- So Chicago must be a big change.
- Have you been here for a winter yet?

119
00:07:32,116 --> 00:07:37,513
No, but I love the cold.
In Brazil is always sunshine.

120
00:07:40,087 --> 00:07:41,932
Geez, that must have been hard to manage.

121
00:07:41,945 --> 00:07:46,953
- Um, why did you leave your last job?
- I didn't really like New York.

122
00:07:46,965 --> 00:07:49,992
I wanted a change around the scenery, huh?

123
00:07:50,107 --> 00:07:54,311
Change of scenery.
You wanted change of scenery.

124
00:07:54,327 --> 00:07:57,983
- Ah, sorry. My English.
- I still make mistakes.

125
00:07:59,866 --> 00:08:01,921
Great.
Thanks for coming by.

126
00:08:02,105 --> 00:08:04,623
Discipline.
Discipline.

127
00:08:04,906 --> 00:08:07,071
Especially with the little boys.

128
00:08:07,106 --> 00:08:08,811
This is key.

129
00:08:09,497 --> 00:08:12,213
Amway money ran out along
with my husband.

130
00:08:12,228 --> 00:08:15,263
So I asked myself,
"Jackie, what do you love?"

131
00:08:15,576 --> 00:08:18,960
Kids, love kids.
Crazy little bastards.

132
00:08:19,357 --> 00:08:21,632
Oh, hey, can I smoke in here?

133
00:08:21,908 --> 00:08:24,373
It was the best ten years of my life.

134
00:08:24,655 --> 00:08:26,720
I really loved those kids.

135
00:08:27,737 --> 00:08:31,581
I don't want to brag, but
for all the families I've worked for,

136
00:08:31,787 --> 00:08:34,971
the kids always end up calling me
Mommy by the third week.

137
00:08:37,176 --> 00:08:40,050
Okay, great.
Thanks for coming by.

138
00:08:42,058 --> 00:08:43,500
What, you get lost?

139
00:08:43,677 --> 00:08:45,502
Seems to be a little problem
with your heart.

140
00:08:47,396 --> 00:08:48,641
Is that from the flu?

141
00:08:48,657 --> 00:08:51,962
Normal heart's about the size of a fist.
Yours is twice that big.

142
00:08:51,976 --> 00:08:55,220
I don't think you have the flu.
Your congestion, shortness of breath--

143
00:08:55,237 --> 00:08:58,790
- definitely because of your heart.
- Sorry, I couldn't find the sonosite.

144
00:08:59,674 --> 00:09:02,842
How many times do I have to tell you
to lay down and put the gown on.

145
00:09:02,901 --> 00:09:06,038
- I ain't wearing that dress.
- Then lose the shirt.

146
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:11,552
You can at least by me dinner first.

147
00:09:12,099 --> 00:09:15,131
Do you get in a lot of fights?
Have an accident or something?

148
00:09:15,145 --> 00:09:18,631
You got what look like old fractures,
a lot of them--

149
00:09:18,648 --> 00:09:22,511
- a few ribs, collarbone, your arm.
- I was an active kid.

150
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:27,091
What about the scar and those burns?

151
00:09:28,707 --> 00:09:33,820
Yeah, well, my pop had
a two-pack-a-day habit.

152
00:09:49,906 --> 00:09:52,692
Whoa. He's got a pericardial effusion.

153
00:09:54,736 --> 00:09:56,803
- A what?
- Fluid around your heart.

154
00:09:56,818 --> 00:09:59,192
Which restricts blood flow
and makes it hard for you to breathe.

155
00:09:59,206 --> 00:10:02,213
I.V. Two of Ativan,
set up for pericardiocentesis.

156
00:10:02,596 --> 00:10:04,753
Hang on.
W-what are you doing?

157
00:10:04,756 --> 00:10:08,493
Sir, we need to do a procedure where I place
a needle into the sac around your heart.

158
00:10:08,506 --> 00:10:10,410
- It's no big deal.
- What?

159
00:10:13,275 --> 00:10:15,001
No. No way.

160
00:10:15,038 --> 00:10:17,022
- You need this procedure.
- No, I don't.

161
00:10:17,037 --> 00:10:19,782
- Yes, you do. You could die.
- Non! Not a chance!

162
00:10:20,518 --> 00:10:21,902
You son of a bitch!

163
00:10:22,808 --> 00:10:25,192
Where'd you get the doctor degree,
through the mail?!

164
00:10:29,905 --> 00:10:33,582
Get out while you can
before Kevorkian starts sticking you!

165
00:10:39,777 --> 00:10:41,441
Let me the hell out of here!

166
00:10:42,278 --> 00:10:44,081
Now!!

167
00:10:52,076 --> 00:10:54,152
What could we do for you today, sir?

168
00:10:54,467 --> 00:10:56,300
I just need my cholesterol prescription refilled.

169
00:10:56,325 --> 00:10:59,450
Cholesterol,silent killer.
It is so good that you're being vigilant.

170
00:10:59,467 --> 00:11:02,563
Dr. Wong from the Family Medical Center
prescribed this for you?

171
00:11:02,575 --> 00:11:04,212
And why didn't you go back to her?

172
00:11:04,225 --> 00:11:07,292
Well, they can't take me for a few months.
I'm supposed to get a blood test, too.

173
00:11:07,306 --> 00:11:10,141
- Check my liver when I'm on the stuff.
- You need to see Dr. Wong.

174
00:11:10,146 --> 00:11:13,380
I'll call up personally and make sure they
know to give you an earlier appointment.

175
00:11:13,398 --> 00:11:16,503
Doc, please, I don't know
when I can take another day off.

176
00:11:16,518 --> 00:11:19,091
I work two jobs. I got his Grandma
watching him all the time.

177
00:11:19,097 --> 00:11:21,763
Okay, I'll call up right now
and let them know you're coming.

178
00:11:21,776 --> 00:11:25,740
Hope, please discharge Mr. Batista
and point him to the Family Center.

179
00:11:25,757 --> 00:11:28,701
Hey, Morris, why is Grasso
still in Curtain Two?

180
00:11:28,715 --> 00:11:30,261
Vertigo guy is still here?

181
00:11:30,276 --> 00:11:33,320
You know, mine felt better after meclizine,
O.T.D. in 45 minutes.

182
00:11:33,338 --> 00:11:36,003
Give him a break-- his first shift
in a month he hasn't killed anybody.

183
00:11:36,017 --> 00:11:37,972
My case is a little bit more
complicated than that, Ray.

184
00:11:37,975 --> 00:11:40,982
- You have an abnormal neuro exam?
- I just have a clinical hunch, okay?

185
00:11:40,996 --> 00:11:42,341
Takes years to develop.

186
00:11:42,356 --> 00:11:45,492
- CT results from radiology.
- That for your vertigo guy?

187
00:11:46,127 --> 00:11:47,630
It's normal, isn't it?

188
00:11:48,636 --> 00:11:50,902
Then we can all sleep a little bit
better tonight, can't we?

189
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:54,001
Sam, could you please get something
from the drug sample closet?

190
00:11:54,008 --> 00:11:56,431
- There's a limited amount of samples.
- You should ask an attending to write...

191
00:11:56,446 --> 00:11:59,211
Dr. Weaver asked me to get it
for one of her patients.

192
00:11:59,227 --> 00:12:00,652
Oh, okay.

193
00:12:00,668 --> 00:12:05,393
No, yeah, it's Batista. B-a-t-i-s-t-a.
Thank you.

194
00:12:05,995 --> 00:12:08,763
That TV news gal,
Courtney Brown called again.

195
00:12:08,877 --> 00:12:11,370
Oh, Channel 5 Courtney Brown?
What'd she want?

196
00:12:11,407 --> 00:12:13,471
She offered me a job as a reporter.

197
00:12:13,506 --> 00:12:14,662
What, you?!

198
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:17,332
I m... of course you.
What did you say?

199
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:18,340
I turned it down.

200
00:12:18,346 --> 00:12:20,853
You turned down the chance
to be the next Sanjay Gupta?

201
00:12:20,867 --> 00:12:23,673
- Are you insane, woman?
- I have no interest in fluff pieces

202
00:12:23,678 --> 00:12:26,281
- about sunburns and bee stings.
- What's wrong with fluff?

203
00:12:26,295 --> 00:12:28,641
Half the patients who come through
here are fluff. I'm the king of fluff.

204
00:12:28,658 --> 00:12:30,620
Word is, you're the best fluffer in town.

205
00:12:30,627 --> 00:12:34,002
- Hope, you ready for that fecal impaction?
- Sure I am.

206
00:12:44,377 --> 00:12:46,972
This is an extremely uncommon error.

207
00:12:46,987 --> 00:12:50,601
Our personnel were clearly
distracted by the ongoing debate.

208
00:12:50,886 --> 00:12:53,262
It's all the more reason why ER
docs should remain in the ER.

209
00:12:53,276 --> 00:12:56,052
I know "ER" sounds a lot
like "O.R.", but it's not.

210
00:12:56,065 --> 00:12:58,802
Our guys were up there trying to keep
your guys from making mistakes.

211
00:12:58,816 --> 00:13:01,712
Based on the information we had,
our decision to operate was correct.

212
00:13:01,727 --> 00:13:04,931
Well, you know what?
You didn't have sufficient information,

213
00:13:04,937 --> 00:13:07,082
because you didn't allow us
to complete a full evaluation.

214
00:13:07,097 --> 00:13:11,182
This isn't a wich hunt, people. We're here
to learn from our mistakes and improve.

215
00:13:11,195 --> 00:13:12,712
You mean their mistakes, right?

216
00:13:12,717 --> 00:13:15,231
Okay, let's not forget that
we're on the same team here.

217
00:13:16,008 --> 00:13:17,933
Oh, Dr. Gates, come on in.

218
00:13:19,207 --> 00:13:22,402
- You missed a case presentation.
- Sorry, I had a patient.

219
00:13:22,418 --> 00:13:24,023
You know what? Sorry.
I just got to...

220
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:26,761
No, that's okay. Timely enough,
Dr. Gates.  No need to sit.

221
00:13:27,145 --> 00:13:28,311
Come on down.

222
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:34,373
Why don't you tell us what the differential
diagnosis was when this patient presented.

223
00:13:35,108 --> 00:13:38,523
Um... triple-A was on the top of our list.

224
00:13:39,008 --> 00:13:40,770
But there were other possibilities.

225
00:13:42,176 --> 00:13:43,713
I should've stayed a resident.

226
00:13:43,876 --> 00:13:47,592
No responsibilities, just heal 'em
and deal 'em. That was the life.

227
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:51,401
Morris, can I tell you something as a friend?

228
00:13:52,436 --> 00:13:55,013
Sometimes you are such a little bitch!

229
00:13:55,296 --> 00:13:57,680
You make three times as much as I do.

230
00:13:57,696 --> 00:14:00,370
And for what?
To give orders instead of take them?

231
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:02,571
Boo-hoo for you.

232
00:14:03,215 --> 00:14:04,150
Mr. Batista!

233
00:14:04,168 --> 00:14:06,222
Hey, Hope, we got a double coming in,
you might want to jump on.

234
00:14:06,225 --> 00:14:08,661
I'll be right there, Dr. Morris.
Mr. Batista, wait.

235
00:14:08,908 --> 00:14:11,653
Um... I called the Family Care Center.

236
00:14:11,665 --> 00:14:13,160
I heard they can't take you
for another month.

237
00:14:13,178 --> 00:14:15,942
I'm very sorry about all that.
The system's...

238
00:14:16,008 --> 00:14:18,482
Well... it needs work.

239
00:14:19,206 --> 00:14:23,570
Lovastatin.
30 pills, 20 milligrams each.

240
00:14:23,658 --> 00:14:26,800
Shh. This should hold you
till your next appointment.

241
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:29,950
Thanks a lot.

242
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:33,582
- This is us, Hope.
- Unidentified male, early 20s.

243
00:14:33,597 --> 00:14:36,512
Altercation on a bus,
blunt trauma to the chest and face.

244
00:14:36,526 --> 00:14:39,173
Ray, Malik, you take this.
Trauma Two is open.

245
00:14:39,188 --> 00:14:40,410
Sam, Hope, you're with me.

246
00:14:40,425 --> 00:14:44,302
He's tachy in the 120s,
resps in the 30s, BP 104/56.

247
00:14:44,318 --> 00:14:46,482
CBC, I.V., type and cross, let's go!

248
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:51,450
Fred Douglas, 38, blunt trauma
to the face with epistaxis.

249
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:53,612
- Son of a bitch broke my nose.
- Keep pressure on it.

250
00:14:53,617 --> 00:14:55,061
Dude was yelling
at some lady on the bus.

251
00:14:55,075 --> 00:14:57,883
I tell him to shut up, next thing you
know he's throwing punches.

252
00:14:59,207 --> 00:15:01,192
- How you doing in there, Ray?
- I'm doing good.

253
00:15:01,216 --> 00:15:03,082
He could probably use when you done.

254
00:15:03,175 --> 00:15:06,322
That guy I got in a fight with--
I didn't hurt him too bad, did I?

255
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:07,642
Hemocue's 12.8.

256
00:15:07,776 --> 00:15:11,910
First, we look for an obvious source
of bleeding that can be cauterized.

257
00:15:11,927 --> 00:15:14,232
Is it broken, Doc?
It sure fe...

258
00:15:16,905 --> 00:15:18,353
God bless you.

259
00:15:19,326 --> 00:15:20,832
Snuck up on me. Sorry.

260
00:15:20,835 --> 00:15:22,881
You need a definitive triple-A diagnosis

261
00:15:22,898 --> 00:15:25,473
before committing an unstable patient
to major surgery.

262
00:15:25,487 --> 00:15:28,630
Au contraire.
Mortality of ruptured triple-A is 90%.

263
00:15:28,648 --> 00:15:29,930
We don't have time
to wait around for tests.

264
00:15:29,947 --> 00:15:31,802
Ultrasound can be done
very quickly at the bedside.

265
00:15:31,816 --> 00:15:33,642
Theoretically, perhaps,
but not in this ER--

266
00:15:33,658 --> 00:15:35,713
besides, every textbook in print says
that this type of patient

267
00:15:35,715 --> 00:15:37,152
- should be taken to the O.R. immediately.
- Ultrasound in the ER is new.

268
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,053
- It's not in every textbook,
- So I guess, what?

269
00:15:39,065 --> 00:15:41,410
- and recent studies have shown...
- ... it's a very accurate at identifying aneurysms.

270
00:15:41,426 --> 00:15:43,730
- You have a new toy?
- People die with delays.

271
00:15:43,747 --> 00:15:47,080
Valentine paper, 1993,
found that most patients

272
00:15:47,097 --> 00:15:49,140
without triple-A's still need surgery
for one thing or...

273
00:15:49,158 --> 00:15:53,002
Most, not all! With severe heart failure,
surgery can be fatal.

274
00:15:53,017 --> 00:15:56,601
The guy's lucky all you did was
torch him. You could've killed him.

275
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:05,331
Okay, um... what is your experience
in the ER with bedside ultrasound?

276
00:16:05,348 --> 00:16:07,260
Well, it's been going on
for a few years now.

277
00:16:07,335 --> 00:16:08,550
He's cute.

278
00:16:08,945 --> 00:16:11,511
- But I hear he lives with somebody.
- Really?

279
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:13,320
- I think he has a kid.
- We found 95% agreement

280
00:16:13,335 --> 00:16:17,733
with final radiology interpretation,
no significant clinical disagreements.

281
00:16:19,248 --> 00:16:22,251
What about for a triple-A specifically?

282
00:16:28,726 --> 00:16:31,593
- I don't know, exactly.
- Well, finding a gallstone is one thing.

283
00:16:31,605 --> 00:16:33,620
A ruptured aneurysm quite another.

284
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:38,561
Well, if we'd seen a normal aorta
with an enlarged liver, we...

285
00:16:38,575 --> 00:16:40,242
would've saved the guy
the risk of surgery.

286
00:16:40,247 --> 00:16:42,170
But you couldn't do it
in a reasonable time frame.

287
00:16:42,187 --> 00:16:44,262
That's because we weren't given
a reasonable time frame.

288
00:16:44,277 --> 00:16:46,220
Well, he was unstable,
and surgery was necessary.

289
00:16:46,235 --> 00:16:48,210
Lighting the guy on fire--
was that necessary, too?

290
00:16:48,227 --> 00:16:50,200
- The Bovie wasn't grounded.
- Whose fault was that?

291
00:16:50,207 --> 00:16:52,063
- Yours. - Mine?!
- You shouldn't have even been in the O.R.

292
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:54,023
You were up there
being a pain in the ass.

293
00:16:54,035 --> 00:16:56,942
We have certain O.R. protocols
for a reason, and you interfered!

294
00:16:56,955 --> 00:17:00,533
Okay, that's enough, that's enough.
Thank you, Dr. Gates.

295
00:17:02,565 --> 00:17:05,381
I think we can all see
what the real problem is here.

296
00:17:05,738 --> 00:17:09,160
Providing the best care requires
communicating openly,

297
00:17:09,175 --> 00:17:12,060
and when we fail to do that,
lives are lost.

298
00:17:12,346 --> 00:17:15,070
I think that's something
we can all learn from today's M & M.

299
00:17:15,106 --> 00:17:17,121
Crenshaw is such a little prick.

300
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:19,481
You know what?
I bet I could take him, too.

301
00:17:19,776 --> 00:17:23,011
Actually, I definitely think I can
take him, and you could kick his ass.

302
00:17:23,027 --> 00:17:24,832
- Luka?
- You're scaring me.

303
00:17:24,845 --> 00:17:27,593
I was looking for you.
Sorry I didn't get back to you earlier.

304
00:17:27,608 --> 00:17:30,493
Angela, you remember Abby.
Sure. Nice to see you back at work.

305
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:31,781
Nice to be back.

306
00:17:31,807 --> 00:17:35,292
So, I probably should've warned you
Curtis Ames was coming in.

307
00:17:35,406 --> 00:17:37,450
Okay, what's all this about,
the settlement?

308
00:17:37,467 --> 00:17:38,972
There is no settlement.

309
00:17:39,007 --> 00:17:43,571
We agreed to the meeting as a show of
good faith, in case we went back to trial.

310
00:17:43,675 --> 00:17:46,213
But don't worry.
The appeal's never gonna happen.

311
00:17:46,226 --> 00:17:48,821
Ames can't even find
a lawyer to take the case.

312
00:17:48,878 --> 00:17:51,103
We're not settling.
It's over.

313
00:17:51,415 --> 00:17:53,442
- Good.
- All right, what do we got?

314
00:17:53,577 --> 00:17:58,442
Okay, hypotensive secondary to what looks
like a traumatic pericardial effusion.

315
00:17:59,557 --> 00:18:02,143
Wow, guy's got a lot of fluid
around his heart.

316
00:18:02,156 --> 00:18:04,192
Looks like I'm gonna do
a percardiocentesis.

317
00:18:04,198 --> 00:18:07,152
- BP's still dropping. 88/52.
- It's weird, I had one this morning.

318
00:18:07,158 --> 00:18:08,671
Okay, Malik, set me up.

319
00:18:09,478 --> 00:18:11,833
- How's your guy?
- Just a bloody nose.

320
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:14,302
Did you say there's something wrong
with my heart?

321
00:18:14,316 --> 00:18:18,112
- He's awake.
- I'm Dr. Morris, attending physician.

322
00:18:19,195 --> 00:18:22,032
Wait a minute, it's you.
From this morning.

323
00:18:22,047 --> 00:18:23,673
- You know him?
- Yeah. No, no.

324
00:18:23,676 --> 00:18:27,301
- You were here earlier?
- No, I wasn't.

325
00:18:28,126 --> 00:18:29,960
- Hey, Sam?
- Yeah?

326
00:18:30,967 --> 00:18:33,051
He's our A.M.A. patient
from this morning, right?

327
00:18:36,177 --> 00:18:37,851
Yeah, the flu jerk.

328
00:18:38,145 --> 00:18:41,161
I don't know what you
people are talking about.

329
00:18:42,386 --> 00:18:44,163
I don't have the flu.

330
00:18:45,275 --> 00:18:49,071
I've never been here... before.

331
00:18:52,578 --> 00:18:54,983
Joe, hey, what's it gonna be?

332
00:18:55,348 --> 00:18:58,493
Good-looking Brazilian or big,
mean Russian, hmm?

333
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:00,012
Joe?

334
00:19:03,316 --> 00:19:06,012
- Going home.
- Say "bye."

335
00:19:25,266 --> 00:19:30,793
We use sound to see, insert the needle into
the pericardial sac to drain the blood.

336
00:19:30,808 --> 00:19:35,430
You use sound to see.
That's fascinating.

337
00:19:35,765 --> 00:19:38,733
Just like bats and dolphins.

338
00:19:39,046 --> 00:19:42,362
It'll release the pressure on your heart
and make it easier for you to breathe.

339
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:46,333
- And I won't feel a thing.
- Not a thing.

340
00:19:48,078 --> 00:19:50,552
- Can I watch?
- Yeah, sure.

341
00:19:54,895 --> 00:19:57,650
- Okay, cool.
- Oh, come on!

342
00:19:58,035 --> 00:20:01,223
This morning, bats and dolphins here
was ready to rip my head off.

343
00:20:01,238 --> 00:20:04,273
- What are you trying to pull, buddy?
- Why is he so angry?

344
00:20:04,275 --> 00:20:06,123
Sam, prep his chest
and have two of versed ready.

345
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,883
Mr. Payton, we'll be right back.
Morris, can we talk?

346
00:20:10,237 --> 00:20:11,240
Morris!

347
00:20:14,205 --> 00:20:15,811
I don't know what
this whack job's game is.

348
00:20:15,825 --> 00:20:18,160
His game is he's probably a little kooky
from a blow to his head.

349
00:20:18,177 --> 00:20:20,211
- He could easily be amnestic.
- He's got to be on something.

350
00:20:20,225 --> 00:20:22,200
- He's totally different now.
- Give the guy a break.

351
00:20:22,217 --> 00:20:23,433
He just got his ass kicked.

352
00:20:23,447 --> 00:20:25,871
He really didn't want that procedure
this morning, right?

353
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,581
Maybe he was really
pissed off at you, Archie.

354
00:20:27,596 --> 00:20:29,321
It wouldn't be the first time.

355
00:20:29,818 --> 00:20:30,631
Now...

356
00:20:31,758 --> 00:20:34,541
I know this may sound
a little corny, but, um...

357
00:20:35,378 --> 00:20:39,203
I always catch more flies with honey,
you know what I mean?

358
00:20:43,557 --> 00:20:46,321
That... that's good, that's good, Ray.

359
00:20:47,127 --> 00:20:48,801
I li... I like that approach.

360
00:20:50,206 --> 00:20:52,930
You'll make a great attending
someday, my man.

361
00:20:53,007 --> 00:20:56,603
I'm sorry.
I know my wallet's in here somewhere.

362
00:20:58,878 --> 00:21:00,493
- Damn it.
- I got that.

363
00:21:00,505 --> 00:21:03,900
- And, uh, can I get a Polish, please?
- No, no. That's okay.

364
00:21:04,026 --> 00:21:05,421
Don't worry about it. I insist, really.

365
00:21:05,585 --> 00:21:07,151
It's not necessary. Really.

366
00:21:07,526 --> 00:21:09,780
When you got your hands full,
it's the least I can do.

367
00:21:10,447 --> 00:21:11,691
It's just a hot dog.

368
00:21:12,945 --> 00:21:17,331
My mom always taught me, random acts of
kindness make the world a better place.

369
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:20,671
Well, I can't argue with that.
Thank you.

370
00:21:21,486 --> 00:21:24,471
- What is he, about six months?
- Five and a half.

371
00:21:25,005 --> 00:21:26,162
He's really cute.

372
00:21:26,175 --> 00:21:28,220
He's got a set of pipes on him
you wouldn't believe.

373
00:21:28,418 --> 00:21:31,972
Are you driving your mom crazy?
Nah. Nah.

374
00:21:38,008 --> 00:21:40,052
Here's your frog. Ribbit.

375
00:21:40,585 --> 00:21:43,070
This yours? There you go.

376
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:48,993
- Excuse me, Dr. Weaver.
- Yeah?

377
00:21:49,178 --> 00:21:53,511
Something is weighing on my heart
and I just can't take it anymore.

378
00:21:53,716 --> 00:21:55,001
What's the problem?

379
00:21:55,476 --> 00:21:58,990
I gave Oscar Batista Lovastatin samples.

380
00:21:59,406 --> 00:22:01,083
That sweet, hard working man--

381
00:22:01,096 --> 00:22:03,151
I was afraid that he would stop
taking his pills

382
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:05,732
and then he would come back here
with a heart attack or a stroke...

383
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:06,891
That precious little boy...

384
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:09,350
it reminded me how moved I was
by your television piece.

385
00:22:09,367 --> 00:22:11,881
I just thought some tiny act
of kindness might really be...

386
00:22:11,906 --> 00:22:14,033
Okay, stop!

387
00:22:16,236 --> 00:22:17,611
You did a good thing.

388
00:22:18,276 --> 00:22:19,273
Really.

389
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:22,671
There might be hope for you, Hope.

390
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:33,771
You told me those drug samples were
for Dr. Weaver's patient.

391
00:22:34,767 --> 00:22:38,920
Well, they were... technically.

392
00:22:38,936 --> 00:22:41,041
Well, technically, you lied to me.

393
00:22:41,057 --> 00:22:42,793
There are rules
for breaking the rules, rookie,

394
00:22:42,796 --> 00:22:46,503
and rule number one is that you never
ever lie to the nurses, you got me?

395
00:22:46,955 --> 00:22:48,573
I'm so sorry.

396
00:22:49,857 --> 00:22:51,250
Fell off a ladder at work.

397
00:22:51,266 --> 00:22:54,923
Dude wasn't paying attention, so I had to pay the price.

398
00:22:54,936 --> 00:22:57,242
Oh, sounds like a dangerous job.

399
00:22:57,875 --> 00:23:00,143
Nah-- carpenter.

400
00:23:00,986 --> 00:23:03,710
It's tough doing it with one arm, though.

401
00:23:03,726 --> 00:23:05,722
Well, sprains heal pretty quickly.

402
00:23:06,578 --> 00:23:09,202
Yeah, that's what they told me
at the hospital.

403
00:23:10,578 --> 00:23:13,611
Uh, I'm, uh, I'm headed for the red line.

404
00:23:13,628 --> 00:23:15,202
Oh, I'm headed this way.

405
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:17,003
Well...

406
00:23:19,907 --> 00:23:22,623
- nice to meet you.
- You, too. Thank you for the hot dog.

407
00:23:22,637 --> 00:23:23,750
It's my pleasure.

408
00:23:24,508 --> 00:23:25,910
I'll catch you later, Joe.

409
00:23:41,945 --> 00:23:44,461
Hey, uh, any messages for me yet, Frank?

410
00:23:44,467 --> 00:23:48,180
No, Morris! The TV producer lady
has not called back yet.

411
00:23:48,185 --> 00:23:49,602
And if you ask me that one more time,

412
00:23:49,617 --> 00:23:52,720
I'm gonna slap you so hard, you'll turn
brunette. Have you got it?

413
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:54,453
Position's been filled.

414
00:23:55,176 --> 00:23:58,061
- What position?
- And stop calling the television station.

415
00:23:58,075 --> 00:24:00,750
- I'm getting complaints.
- Oh, that... oh, that position, right.

416
00:24:00,765 --> 00:24:03,820
They filled it, huh?
Who'd they... who'd the find so fast?

417
00:24:03,838 --> 00:24:05,281
- Me.
- You?

418
00:24:05,295 --> 00:24:08,071
- I thought you turned it down.
- Yeah, well I changed my mind.

419
00:24:08,137 --> 00:24:12,101
Figured it was about time someone put
something worthwhile on television.

420
00:24:13,488 --> 00:24:15,543
So, Smitty, how long you had the rash?

421
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:18,700
- About two weeks now.
- Got any food allergies?

422
00:24:18,807 --> 00:24:19,832
No.

423
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,373
- You on any medications?
- Just my blood pressure pills.

424
00:24:22,386 --> 00:24:23,813
All right, come on, have a seat.

425
00:24:25,386 --> 00:24:26,690
What kind of pills?

426
00:24:29,466 --> 00:24:30,500
All right.

427
00:24:31,578 --> 00:24:35,011
Oh, you see, that's the problem.
Rash is a common reaction to enalopril.

428
00:24:35,025 --> 00:24:36,280
Who prescribed these for you?

429
00:24:36,288 --> 00:24:38,761
Doc up at the clinic put me on it
'bout ten years ago.

430
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:41,610
- This and something else.
- Ten years ago?

431
00:24:42,035 --> 00:24:43,410
Who gave you these?

432
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:45,453
See, my man T-Bone-- you know T...

433
00:24:45,465 --> 00:24:49,142
Smitty, you can't take other people's
medications, man. It's not safe.

434
00:24:49,157 --> 00:24:51,240
- Everybody does it.
- Everybody who?

435
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:55,171
Up at First Mission Baptist, Pastor Watkins
does a drug exchange program.

436
00:24:55,545 --> 00:24:58,191
You should come up there sometime.
Man gives a powerful sermon...

437
00:24:58,207 --> 00:25:01,121
Okay, hold on, hold on.
He does a drug exchange program?

438
00:25:01,135 --> 00:25:03,943
Hell, yeah.
I ain't got insurance.

439
00:25:04,106 --> 00:25:05,882
You know how much this stuff costs?

440
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:13,160
You can't possibly think ultrasound
was contraindicated.

441
00:25:13,168 --> 00:25:15,060
I do if it can't be done immediately.

442
00:25:15,077 --> 00:25:16,721
You could've told me that before the M&M.

443
00:25:16,735 --> 00:25:18,980
Well, I didn't realize I had to point
out the totally obvious.

444
00:25:18,997 --> 00:25:22,080
- I can't... I can't win with you.
- Well, finally we agree on something.

445
00:25:22,095 --> 00:25:23,320
- Finally. Yes.
- Yes.

446
00:25:23,336 --> 00:25:24,780
You don't have to take the piss out
on me, you know.

447
00:25:24,785 --> 00:25:26,420
- The piss? Piss?
- Yes. Yes.

448
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:30,102
Yep, you got a nice fluid pocket.
This is gonna be a snap.

449
00:25:30,117 --> 00:25:32,270
Sam, draw up some one percent lido.

450
00:25:35,588 --> 00:25:40,991
Okay, before I start, just a few things.
Main risks here, bleeding and infection.

451
00:25:41,036 --> 00:25:43,481
Y-You-You could infect my heart?

452
00:25:43,836 --> 00:25:47,343
- Come on, let's not make this any harder.
- Calm down and let them work.

453
00:25:47,375 --> 00:25:48,311
No!

454
00:25:49,275 --> 00:25:53,623
What about bleeding?
I have trepidation about bleeding.

455
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:56,650
Well, it's only a minor risk 'cause
we're using such a small needle.

456
00:25:57,558 --> 00:26:00,571
Well, not so small, but... thin.

457
00:26:00,967 --> 00:26:04,322
And you'll be all numbed up,
so you won't feel a thing.

458
00:26:05,976 --> 00:26:08,382
Okeydokey.
Let's do this.

459
00:26:14,277 --> 00:26:16,242
Stop it! Get that thing away
from me, you clown!

460
00:26:16,436 --> 00:26:20,203
- I told you, I don't want that!
- You agreed to the procedure, Mr. Payton.

461
00:26:20,217 --> 00:26:22,142
- Screw that!
- Mr. Payton...

462
00:26:22,156 --> 00:26:25,563
And stop calling me that.
My name's Clyde Sandberg.

463
00:26:25,576 --> 00:26:28,861
You people got short-term
memory loss or something?!

464
00:26:29,575 --> 00:26:30,452
Huh?!

465
00:26:32,376 --> 00:26:34,810
- You ambushed me.
- You were spewing absurdities.

466
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:36,720
- Do you not like me or something?
- I think you're a wanker.

467
00:26:36,737 --> 00:26:38,701
- A wanker?
- You're cocky, you're arrogant...

468
00:26:38,715 --> 00:26:39,833
And you're not as smooth

469
00:26:39,838 --> 00:26:41,211
- as you think you are.
- Oh, really, I'm not?

470
00:26:41,227 --> 00:26:43,461
- No, you're not.
- I never said I was.

471
00:26:53,027 --> 00:26:57,400
You know, I called you the other night,
and a woman answered.

472
00:26:57,427 --> 00:26:59,481
Yeah, I can explain that.

473
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:02,090
Now would be a good time.

474
00:27:17,516 --> 00:27:20,722
Here! Here! Bats and dolphins guy,
I figured it out.

475
00:27:22,296 --> 00:27:23,892
- It's DID.
- What?

476
00:27:24,077 --> 00:27:26,330
Dissociative Identity Disorder.

477
00:27:26,477 --> 00:27:28,513
Multiple personalities.
You're kidding me.

478
00:27:28,526 --> 00:27:30,533
- Psych make that diagnosis?
- No, I paged them three times.

479
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:32,611
- They haven't come down yet.
- This is based off of what,

480
00:27:32,627 --> 00:27:36,413
- your extensive psychiatric expertise?
- No, he's a classic presentation--

481
00:27:36,425 --> 00:27:39,021
old abuse injuries,
keeps changing his name.

482
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:41,480
Okay, maybe it's you that needs
the psych evaluation.

483
00:27:41,496 --> 00:27:44,031
No, I'm serious, Ray.
We have to double doctor this guy.

484
00:27:44,075 --> 00:27:47,450
Listen, he keeps refusing treatment,
that effusion will kill him.

485
00:27:47,466 --> 00:27:48,972
And who knows how long psych will take?

486
00:27:48,978 --> 00:27:51,481
I mean, by the time their resident sees
him, they present to the attending,

487
00:27:51,496 --> 00:27:53,220
they have their stupid meeting,
it could be hours.

488
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:56,701
Double doctoring-- that's a pretty big deal.
Can't we just treat with

489
00:27:56,727 --> 00:27:59,133
- NSAIDS and steroids?
- He's refusing vital treatment.

490
00:27:59,146 --> 00:28:00,932
And that, my friend, is grounds
for a double doctor.

491
00:28:00,946 --> 00:28:03,770
- Come on, come on, get with me here.
- What, so I'm back on the case now?

492
00:28:03,788 --> 00:28:04,752
Yeah.

493
00:28:05,777 --> 00:28:07,661
Look, I tell you what.

494
00:28:09,007 --> 00:28:10,152
I'll talk to him.

495
00:28:10,346 --> 00:28:13,810
I'll try and get some sort of read.
But maybe you should hang back.

496
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:16,320
You already pissed him off enough today.

497
00:28:22,095 --> 00:28:25,681
So... I have a few questions for you.

498
00:28:26,157 --> 00:28:27,693
Can you tell me what day it is?

499
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:33,730
Thursday.

500
00:28:34,147 --> 00:28:35,450
Month and year?

501
00:28:35,676 --> 00:28:39,323
You know, they got this new thing out
called a "calendar."

502
00:28:42,947 --> 00:28:46,961
My freakin' God-- November. 2006.

503
00:28:47,277 --> 00:28:50,113
- Do you know where you are?
- What is this place, Romper Room?

504
00:28:50,125 --> 00:28:54,202
I see "Stupid" and "Retard"
and "Jerkoff."

505
00:28:55,276 --> 00:28:58,163
I'm at County General Hospital.

506
00:28:58,838 --> 00:29:01,361
- I am not double doctoring.
- Ray, he's only going to get worse.

507
00:29:01,366 --> 00:29:03,521
He's hypotensive
with reduced cardiac output.

508
00:29:03,537 --> 00:29:05,342
Look, he already hates doctors,
especially you.

509
00:29:05,355 --> 00:29:07,480
Do you really want to tie him down
and stick a needle into his chest?

510
00:29:07,497 --> 00:29:10,221
- If it'll save his life, hell, yeah.
- I am out, Archie.

511
00:29:10,237 --> 00:29:13,062
Fine, I'll get somebody else.
Hey, Pratt.

512
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:15,020
No, no, no, no.
Hasta-la-bye-bye.

513
00:29:15,037 --> 00:29:17,142
Pratt, I need you to sign off
on a double doctor.

514
00:29:18,078 --> 00:29:20,573
- What you got, a foster kid or something?
- No, he's a competent adult.

515
00:29:20,587 --> 00:29:22,800
He's got a pericardial effusion
and doesn't want treatment.

516
00:29:22,818 --> 00:29:25,302
Morris wants to get medieval
on the guy because he thinks...

517
00:29:25,316 --> 00:29:27,093
I think he's DID.

518
00:29:27,108 --> 00:29:30,112
- Multiple personalities.
- Yeah, I know what it is. What did psych say?

519
00:29:30,127 --> 00:29:31,250
They're MIA.

520
00:29:31,266 --> 00:29:33,190
Morris you do know that
multiple personality syndrome...

521
00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:35,072
Dissociative Identity Disorder,
they changed it.

522
00:29:35,088 --> 00:29:37,171
Yeah, whatever.
Some docs don't even think it exists.

523
00:29:37,187 --> 00:29:39,060
There's a ton of literature to support it.

524
00:29:39,076 --> 00:29:41,752
- Okay, so how are his vitals?
- Systolic's holding in the 90's.

525
00:29:41,766 --> 00:29:43,740
- And mental status?
- Alert and oriented.

526
00:29:43,757 --> 00:29:46,492
- Tox screen and CT?
- Clear.

527
00:29:47,567 --> 00:29:50,322
You got to treat him conservatively.
Wait for psych, it's their call.

528
00:29:52,077 --> 00:29:54,553
Pratt, you want me to be more thorough.
That's what I'm doing.

529
00:29:54,777 --> 00:29:57,151
Pratt, listen to me
for one second, please.

530
00:29:57,166 --> 00:30:00,432
If a patient presents within a week of
surgery, it's considered a bounce-back.

531
00:30:00,456 --> 00:30:02,323
Make sure all bounce-backs are
logged in the follow-up book.

532
00:30:02,337 --> 00:30:03,951
Hey, can I speak to you for a second?

533
00:30:03,966 --> 00:30:06,793
We're in seroma. Removing
the staples and packing the dermis.

534
00:30:06,795 --> 00:30:10,111
Uh, wasn't actually talking to you.

535
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:16,630
Um, okay. Go ahead.
I'll just get started.

536
00:30:18,038 --> 00:30:21,001
- So how's surgery treating you?
- Like a stepchild.

537
00:30:21,406 --> 00:30:22,921
Radiology's looking better every day.

538
00:30:22,938 --> 00:30:26,022
It'll be over soon enough.
I hated my surgical rotation.

539
00:30:26,978 --> 00:30:29,902
So, um, do you like hockey?

540
00:30:31,005 --> 00:30:32,961
Tonsil or ice?

541
00:30:34,278 --> 00:30:36,200
Uh, ice.

542
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:38,862
Mm, too bad.

543
00:30:40,775 --> 00:30:42,820
But, yeah, I'll settle for a Hawks game.

544
00:30:52,028 --> 00:30:54,030
He still refusing treatment?

545
00:30:55,005 --> 00:30:59,933
Last BP was 84 over 50,
and he's developed pulsus paradoxus.

546
00:31:02,788 --> 00:31:04,242
Found his old file.

547
00:31:06,195 --> 00:31:09,161
Willis Payton is his real name.

548
00:31:09,806 --> 00:31:12,561
Probably be the "host" personality.

549
00:31:12,676 --> 00:31:15,393
His Clyde character must be
one of his "alters".

550
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,532
He was here a bunch of times
between '88 and '96.

551
00:31:19,866 --> 00:31:23,521
Foster kid, abuse related injuries--
some bad ones, too.

552
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:27,812
It's a classic DID history.

553
00:31:28,616 --> 00:31:30,411
Psych's still a no show?

554
00:31:37,276 --> 00:31:39,953
I know everybody down here
thinks I'm a joke.

555
00:31:43,706 --> 00:31:48,100
If Pratt said DID, he'd be a genius.

556
00:31:50,456 --> 00:31:51,601
But I...

557
00:31:51,907 --> 00:31:54,371
I know that I'm right about this.

558
00:31:57,338 --> 00:32:00,182
And all I can do is suck on it
and watch this guy die.

559
00:32:04,178 --> 00:32:05,582
You did what you could.

560
00:32:07,706 --> 00:32:10,073
And you're not a joke, Archie.

561
00:32:10,737 --> 00:32:12,003
You're an attending.

562
00:32:17,466 --> 00:32:18,590
Thank you.

563
00:32:26,937 --> 00:32:30,752
Was a time when that mountain
seemed so high,

564
00:32:30,778 --> 00:32:33,322
like it stretched up to
the Pearly Gates themselves.

565
00:32:35,007 --> 00:32:37,251
Promised land seemed like an idea.

566
00:32:38,026 --> 00:32:40,630
Like no matter how hard we worked,

567
00:32:41,307 --> 00:32:44,171
it was only sand between our fingers.

568
00:32:44,877 --> 00:32:46,510
But we're still here.

569
00:32:47,225 --> 00:32:50,860
Proud and strong, Lord have mercy,
we're still here.

570
00:32:50,878 --> 00:32:53,251
But we got a whole lot of work to do,

571
00:32:53,428 --> 00:32:57,212
because the more things change,
the more they stay the same.

572
00:32:57,877 --> 00:32:59,462
Young-Young brother in the back.

573
00:33:00,227 --> 00:33:02,661
You're new.
Stand up and introduce yourself.

574
00:33:04,407 --> 00:33:05,670
No, no, you!

575
00:33:08,897 --> 00:33:12,122
- Evening, everyone, I'm Greg Pratt.
- Welcome, Brother Pratt.

576
00:33:12,137 --> 00:33:13,162
Come on up front.

577
00:33:13,175 --> 00:33:15,550
Nice to see young folk in
the evening service, isn't it?

578
00:33:18,138 --> 00:33:19,703
Heart's getting worse, you know.

579
00:33:21,575 --> 00:33:25,482
Here we go again. No!
You need me to spell it?

580
00:33:25,497 --> 00:33:29,623
If you keep refusing treatment,
it's gonna go down one of two ways:

581
00:33:30,407 --> 00:33:32,131
one, the doctors are going
to come in here,

582
00:33:32,137 --> 00:33:35,882
- tie you down, and do the procedure.
- They can't touch me, I got rights.

583
00:33:35,897 --> 00:33:39,780
Or two, we get to watch you die.

584
00:33:41,636 --> 00:33:42,980
Fun for you.

585
00:33:44,077 --> 00:33:45,781
There's a third option.

586
00:33:46,146 --> 00:33:50,170
You give consent, we fix your heart,
and you go home.

587
00:33:51,875 --> 00:33:53,423
All we want to do is help.

588
00:33:53,435 --> 00:33:56,501
Yeah, you've been loads of help so far.

589
00:34:04,846 --> 00:34:08,300
- I know you're scared.
- No, I ain't scared of nothing!

590
00:34:12,006 --> 00:34:15,153
I know you've been hurt.
A lot.

591
00:34:17,685 --> 00:34:19,591
But you are safe here.

592
00:34:20,807 --> 00:34:26,063
I know you don't want to trust us,
but you can. I promise.

593
00:34:46,678 --> 00:34:48,150
Was, um...

594
00:34:50,318 --> 00:34:51,782
was-was...

595
00:34:53,276 --> 00:34:54,752
was I sleeping?

596
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:57,782
No.

597
00:34:59,156 --> 00:35:00,942
I lost time.

598
00:35:03,566 --> 00:35:05,423
I lost time again.

599
00:35:08,866 --> 00:35:09,951
Willis?

600
00:35:12,335 --> 00:35:13,382
Yeah?

601
00:35:14,558 --> 00:35:17,141
Clyde's been giving us a hard time.

602
00:35:20,997 --> 00:35:25,792
- I... I thought he was gone.
- You know about Clyde?

603
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:27,460
Yeah.

604
00:35:28,476 --> 00:35:31,210
My friends told me about him.

605
00:35:32,368 --> 00:35:34,092
He's very negative.

606
00:35:37,466 --> 00:35:40,072
Well, Clyde doesn't want us help you.

607
00:35:40,765 --> 00:35:46,512
So all we could do was give you some
medicine, but that's not working too well.

608
00:35:47,028 --> 00:35:54,403
Um, well... can you, can you still fix me?

609
00:35:55,117 --> 00:35:57,413
Willis, I need Clyde's permission.

610
00:35:57,995 --> 00:36:01,063
I can't make him do anything.
I can't.

611
00:36:01,077 --> 00:36:04,310
We can't start and stop again.
We're running out of time.

612
00:36:04,326 --> 00:36:06,862
No. No, no, no.

613
00:36:07,475 --> 00:36:08,983
No.

614
00:36:10,806 --> 00:36:14,901
Willis! Damn it, let me talk
to Clyde right now!

615
00:36:14,917 --> 00:36:17,971
Do not make me hurt you!
Let me talk to Clyde!

616
00:36:17,986 --> 00:36:20,770
How many times I got to tell you
to get off me, bitch?

617
00:36:20,785 --> 00:36:22,871
Huh, how many times?! Huh?!

618
00:36:26,385 --> 00:36:27,760
I saw Willis.

619
00:36:28,178 --> 00:36:30,912
- He's letting us do the procedure.
- He's a pansy!

620
00:36:31,877 --> 00:36:35,553
Yeah, well, he's brave enough to let us
stick a needle in his heart.

621
00:36:35,565 --> 00:36:38,812
Piss off, bitch.

622
00:36:39,707 --> 00:36:40,711
Fine.

623
00:36:40,957 --> 00:36:43,883
You be a tough guy all the way
to your funeral. I'm done.

624
00:36:46,967 --> 00:36:48,051
Hey!

625
00:36:52,185 --> 00:36:54,810
You stick my heart, that means
I get out of here, right?

626
00:36:55,405 --> 00:36:56,320
Yep.

627
00:36:58,725 --> 00:36:59,812
Do it.

628
00:36:59,908 --> 00:37:02,423
I told you I ain't scared of nothing.

629
00:37:04,295 --> 00:37:08,342
The drug exchange program is only
for people who have prescriptions

630
00:37:08,797 --> 00:37:10,573
 but can't afford the drugs.

631
00:37:10,588 --> 00:37:13,743
Smitty's prescription was ten years old.
And he had Enalopril.

632
00:37:13,757 --> 00:37:18,070
Enalopril is not the first drug of choice
for black folks with high blood pressure.

633
00:37:18,437 --> 00:37:21,132
I suggest that you start
an exercise program.

634
00:37:21,145 --> 00:37:25,320
Get your congregation to stop eating salt
and fried foods and start exercising.

635
00:37:25,336 --> 00:37:27,930
Trust me, you'll do
a whole lot more good.

636
00:37:28,225 --> 00:37:30,573
We don't just help people
with high blood pressure.

637
00:37:30,587 --> 00:37:33,243
We have diabetics, asthmatics,
you name it.

638
00:37:33,255 --> 00:37:37,992
Look, what you're doing is dangerous,
okay, not to mention illegal.

639
00:37:40,808 --> 00:37:43,363
I have an obligation
to this community, Dr. Pratt.

640
00:37:43,778 --> 00:37:47,712
These people are shackled by a system
over which they have no control.

641
00:37:47,887 --> 00:37:51,233
The one thing I will not do is nothing.

642
00:37:52,255 --> 00:37:55,540
Excuse me, Dr. Morris, can I ask
your advice on something?

643
00:37:55,905 --> 00:38:01,240
I lied to Samantha about something
and now she's really steamed.

644
00:38:01,256 --> 00:38:05,072
Ooh, bad move. Piss one nurse off,
piss 'em all off, like the mafia.

645
00:38:05,276 --> 00:38:08,301
You know, whenever I'm in
a precarious situation,

646
00:38:08,307 --> 00:38:11,401
I always ask myself,
"What would Jesus do?"

647
00:38:11,707 --> 00:38:12,821
Right.

648
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:17,012
What would Jesus would do
if the nurses hated him?

649
00:38:17,418 --> 00:38:20,351
Well, he would do the right thing,
of course.

650
00:38:20,356 --> 00:38:24,410
That's the problem, I thought that
I was doing the right thing. I guess...

651
00:38:24,898 --> 00:38:28,413
- I just... I did it the wrong way.
- Hey, it's the story of my life.

652
00:38:28,426 --> 00:38:33,232
You know, sometimes it doesn't matter
how much we kick and scream.

653
00:38:33,527 --> 00:38:34,981
Even when we're right.

654
00:38:36,277 --> 00:38:39,753
"The prophet is without honor
in his own land."

655
00:38:40,197 --> 00:38:46,112
- Matthew 13:54.
- Oh, I love that one. Big Matthew fan.

656
00:38:47,418 --> 00:38:49,790
You have a good night, Dr. Morris.

657
00:39:04,907 --> 00:39:06,263
Feeling better?

658
00:39:07,407 --> 00:39:10,063
Drained almost half a liter of fluid
from around your heart.

659
00:39:10,115 --> 00:39:12,531
Your blood pressure and pulse
are back to normal.

660
00:39:12,548 --> 00:39:15,262
Soon as a bed opens up,
we'll get you upstairs to a room.

661
00:39:19,837 --> 00:39:22,702
So, you're doing great.

662
00:39:27,006 --> 00:39:29,162
You got my glasses?

663
00:39:30,278 --> 00:39:32,621
Uh... let me check, yeah.

664
00:39:50,547 --> 00:39:53,410
- That kid gonna be okay?
- Who?

665
00:39:55,868 --> 00:39:59,563
Yeah, I'm sure he is.
Looks like he's leaving.

666
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:05,122
He was racing Hot Wheels.

667
00:40:07,575 --> 00:40:10,521
His mom, she was mean.

668
00:40:32,615 --> 00:40:33,812
Willis?

669
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:39,480
My name is Andre.

670
00:40:44,376 --> 00:40:46,493
I like Hot Wheels.

671
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:50,031
I wish his mom wasn't so mean.

672
00:40:55,108 --> 00:40:57,360
Hey, hey... 

673
00:41:00,597 --> 00:41:04,652
don't tell my dad I'm here, okay?
He can be pretty mean, too.

674
00:41:10,647 --> 00:41:14,113
Your secret's safe with me. Okay?

675
00:41:18,595 --> 00:41:20,823
It's kind of dark in here.

676
00:41:25,887 --> 00:41:27,970
You're not gonna leave, are you?

677
00:41:29,467 --> 00:41:30,803
No.

678
00:41:33,207 --> 00:41:36,832
No way, buddy, no.
I'm here all night.

679
00:41:38,706 --> 00:41:40,302
That's good.

680
00:41:54,705 --> 00:41:58,961
So, what kind of Hot Wheels you got?

681
00:41:59,847 --> 00:42:02,533
All kinds. I collect 'em.

682
00:42:02,548 --> 00:42:03,912
Yeah?

683
00:42:04,237 --> 00:42:06,241
I used to collect them, too.

684
00:42:06,905 --> 00:42:08,603
What kind you got?

685
00:42:09,707 --> 00:42:13,273
I used to have a '57 Chevy.

686
00:42:13,696 --> 00:42:15,681
I got that one.

687
00:42:16,286 --> 00:42:18,912
- Shelby Cobra.
- Got it.

688
00:42:19,285 --> 00:42:24,910
Okay, all right... '65 Mustang Fastback.

689
00:42:25,397 --> 00:42:27,903
- I got two.
- You got two?

690
00:42:27,915 --> 00:42:29,791
- Yeah.
- Wow.

691
00:42:31,778 --> 00:42:34,730
I used to have three,
but I gave one to my friend.

692
00:42:34,748 --> 00:42:38,263
Well, you'll have to give one to me,
'cause I don't think I have mine anymore.

693
00:42:41,737 --> 00:42:47,002
