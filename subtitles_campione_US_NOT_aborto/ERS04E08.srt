1
00:00:03,867 --> 00:00:06,831
ER

2
00:00:06,832 --> 00:00:08,128
Previously on ER...

3
00:00:08,129 --> 00:00:10,045
- Are you firing me?
- Jeanie, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:10,046 --> 00:00:13,749
Oh, jeez! Your clinic proposal.
That's tonight, isn't it?

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,755
Yeah, Oak Park, 7:00.
That's what we said.

6
00:00:15,756 --> 00:00:18,723
Your husband lied
to you about his condition!

7
00:00:18,724 --> 00:00:20,391
He's going to die!

8
00:00:20,392 --> 00:00:22,051
Peter Benton, Rocket Romano.

9
00:00:22,052 --> 00:00:25,756
Dr. Benton. Hey, Lizzie's
talked about you.

10
00:00:26,287 --> 00:00:28,118
I don't usually do this kind of thing.

11
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:29,615
Sure. That's what they all say.

12
00:00:29,616 --> 00:00:31,938
My family has a few bucks
and everything changes?

13
00:00:31,939 --> 00:00:32,939
A few bucks? Is that what it is to you?

14
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:40,896
Freak Show

15
00:00:45,164 --> 00:00:46,328
Carol!

16
00:00:48,129 --> 00:00:50,968
Man, look at you! I hardly sleep
a wink on the redeye...

17
00:00:51,178 --> 00:00:53,388
...and you're jogging and smiling.

18
00:00:53,601 --> 00:00:57,057
There's nothing like a visit with the folks
to make you appreciate home.

19
00:00:57,276 --> 00:00:58,689
The staff will be thrilled.

20
00:00:58,863 --> 00:01:01,987
You haven't been too high
on the popularity list lately.

21
00:01:02,205 --> 00:01:04,533
- I've been kind of a jerk.
- Worse.

22
00:01:04,752 --> 00:01:06,712
- Pain in the ass?
- Keep going.

23
00:01:06,882 --> 00:01:08,593
- Total schmuck.
- Bingo.

24
00:01:08,804 --> 00:01:12,177
We all understood. It's just
we're glad you're getting over it.

25
00:01:12,521 --> 00:01:15,859
You know, that meant a lot to Doug,
you showing up like that.

26
00:01:16,071 --> 00:01:17,698
It meant a lot to me too.

27
00:01:18,076 --> 00:01:19,572
I almost forgot.

28
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:22,165
I found this when I unpacked.

29
00:01:23,255 --> 00:01:27,340
- "CH"?
- Yeah. "Carol Hathaway. " It's from "DR. "

30
00:01:27,557 --> 00:01:30,431
- Did you read it?
- No. But I was tempted.

31
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:34,112
Anna? Can you come in here
and give me a hand?

32
00:01:34,323 --> 00:01:37,114
- What have you got?
- A shoulder reduction on a boxer.

33
00:01:37,288 --> 00:01:39,034
Coach made him take ballet.

34
00:01:39,251 --> 00:01:40,332
I'll do traction.

35
00:01:40,546 --> 00:01:42,791
Then I will give you countertraction.

36
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:45,466
Thanks, Lily.

37
00:01:46,351 --> 00:01:48,596
- So how have you been?
- Fine.

38
00:01:48,815 --> 00:01:51,774
On my count. One, two, three.

39
00:01:53,284 --> 00:01:56,824
- Seen any interesting cases?
- No. Not really.

40
00:01:57,043 --> 00:01:59,003
- Done any interesting procedures?
- Nope.

41
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,180
- You wanna grab some breakfast?
- I'm not hungry. Thanks.

42
00:02:02,348 --> 00:02:04,308
- What? Are you still angry?
- I'm over it.

43
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:05,719
You sure?

44
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,649
Can we just focus
on the patient, please?

45
00:02:10,241 --> 00:02:12,736
- Hey! Cute little bugger.
- Thanks.

46
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:14,912
I bet he keeps you pretty busy.

47
00:02:15,128 --> 00:02:18,252
Actually, he lives with his mother.
So I see him when I can.

48
00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:20,299
What about you? You got any kids?

49
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:22,392
None they've been able to pin on me.

50
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:26,694
You know, Peter, you've been
on my mind lately.

51
00:02:27,407 --> 00:02:30,198
You made the short list for my team.
You still interested?

52
00:02:30,874 --> 00:02:31,955
Sure.

53
00:02:33,255 --> 00:02:35,749
- I just have a couple of reservations.
- Reservations?

54
00:02:35,928 --> 00:02:36,960
Yeah.

55
00:02:37,723 --> 00:02:41,596
I need a team player. Someone who is
compatible with Lizzie Corday.

56
00:02:41,775 --> 00:02:46,740
Now, word has it you and she have had
a couple of run-ins.

57
00:02:47,789 --> 00:02:50,462
We've had our differences,
but we've worked them out.

58
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:52,506
Differences can be healthy.

59
00:02:53,093 --> 00:02:54,804
Can you keep up with her?

60
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,340
Absolutely.

61
00:02:57,521 --> 00:02:58,981
Do you have the time?

62
00:03:00,402 --> 00:03:01,483
Sure.

63
00:03:03,117 --> 00:03:04,150
Great.

64
00:03:04,955 --> 00:03:07,960
We'll do a trial run,
see if we're all compatible.

65
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:10,084
And then I'll make my final decision.

66
00:03:14,478 --> 00:03:15,724
What's going on?

67
00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:17,602
Mark, when did you get back?

68
00:03:17,777 --> 00:03:18,810
Hi. Late last night.

69
00:03:18,988 --> 00:03:22,528
- What are these people doing here?
- They're patients for your new clinic.

70
00:03:22,706 --> 00:03:25,081
No. The clinic doesn't open
until next week.

71
00:03:25,253 --> 00:03:27,415
You said to put the announcement
in for today.

72
00:03:27,592 --> 00:03:30,087
No. I said next week.

73
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,893
Oh, man!

74
00:03:32,061 --> 00:03:34,222
Oh, I'm really sorry.

75
00:03:34,484 --> 00:03:36,645
Is there anything that I can do?

76
00:03:38,326 --> 00:03:40,202
Start giving out numbers.

77
00:04:31,202 --> 00:04:32,579
Hey, everybody, listen up.

78
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:34,784
I need volunteers
to come back next week.

79
00:04:35,003 --> 00:04:36,962
You'll get on the front of the line.

80
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:39,884
No? Then everyone
has to be really patient.

81
00:04:40,062 --> 00:04:41,557
Tell that to my boss.

82
00:04:41,731 --> 00:04:43,857
- Bryan, baby.
- Oh, miss...

83
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:46,605
...I can't keep standing like this.
I've got the gout.

84
00:04:46,784 --> 00:04:48,613
Take a chair.
Anyone else need a chair?

85
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,166
Stop jumping up and down.

86
00:04:50,376 --> 00:04:52,454
Wait over in Chairs.
Take a number.

87
00:04:52,672 --> 00:04:56,341
Twenty-seven? I might as well
be waiting six hours in the ER.

88
00:04:56,555 --> 00:04:58,681
Go ahead. That would
help me out a lot.

89
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,136
Carol?

90
00:05:00,481 --> 00:05:03,901
Kerry, hi. Did Mark tell you
about the scheduling snafu?

91
00:05:04,072 --> 00:05:06,067
Very unfortunate.
I need to talk with you.

92
00:05:06,243 --> 00:05:07,324
I'm a little busy now.

93
00:05:07,496 --> 00:05:09,242
Weren't you scheduled
to work the ER?

94
00:05:09,417 --> 00:05:11,495
I had to take the day off
to run the clinic.

95
00:05:11,672 --> 00:05:14,926
- Could you spare anyone to help?
- When I signed off on the clinic...

96
00:05:15,097 --> 00:05:17,305
...you promised to find
your own personnel...

97
00:05:17,476 --> 00:05:19,887
...and it wouldn't impinge
on your regular duties.

98
00:05:20,066 --> 00:05:22,986
I could turf the runny noses,
BP checks over to the ER...

99
00:05:23,155 --> 00:05:24,985
...and have your personnel
handle them.

100
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,488
- Okay. I'll give you Yosh Takata.
- Who?

101
00:05:27,707 --> 00:05:29,369
Nursing Administration.

102
00:05:29,586 --> 00:05:31,877
Excuse me.
Transfer from upstairs.

103
00:05:33,344 --> 00:05:37,014
Why don't you talk to my friend
at the Gay and Lesbian Defense Fund?

104
00:05:37,186 --> 00:05:40,025
They represent people with HIV
and AIDS who have been fired.

105
00:05:40,235 --> 00:05:43,441
Maggie, thanks for your concern,
but that's not what happened.

106
00:05:43,658 --> 00:05:44,691
Sure.

107
00:05:45,413 --> 00:05:48,702
You're the best P.A. we have.
I just hate to see you give up.

108
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,749
I'm not giving up. I'm moving on.

109
00:05:51,175 --> 00:05:54,513
Al's in Atlanta checking out leads
and a couple of construction jobs.

110
00:05:54,683 --> 00:05:57,604
But it's illegal for them to fire you
for being HIV-positive.

111
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,900
- You think that's why they fired me?
- You don't?

112
00:06:01,907 --> 00:06:05,612
No. They could've done that last year.
It's because of the budget.

113
00:06:12,221 --> 00:06:14,631
- Hi.
- Hi.

114
00:06:15,186 --> 00:06:17,395
- I missed you.
- Me too.

115
00:06:17,608 --> 00:06:20,280
You did? Because you didn't call.

116
00:06:20,489 --> 00:06:23,328
Well, we were on the road
the whole time but...

117
00:06:23,537 --> 00:06:25,532
So I wasn't able to wrap it.

118
00:06:26,294 --> 00:06:27,790
What's this?

119
00:06:28,673 --> 00:06:33,176
Oh, it's beautiful! Thank you!
I love it!

120
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,269
Oh, my-!
Would you latch it for me?

121
00:06:35,438 --> 00:06:36,471
Sure.

122
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:40,989
The guy at the shop said that
it is a genuine diamond.

123
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:43,155
A real diamond.

124
00:06:43,331 --> 00:06:47,333
No one has ever gotten me a real
diamond before, Mark. I love it.

125
00:06:48,384 --> 00:06:50,129
- Pardon us.
- Welcome back.

126
00:06:50,346 --> 00:06:51,807
There's no place like home.

127
00:06:52,016 --> 00:06:53,513
This coffee's terrible.

128
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:57,017
I'm really awful in the kitchen.
Sorry.

129
00:06:57,194 --> 00:06:59,190
I think it tastes really good.

130
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,199
- What do we got?
- Twelve-year-old boy.

131
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:07,163
Hit-and-run on his way to school.
GCS 7. Got routine blood work.

132
00:07:07,383 --> 00:07:12,300
Chest and abdominal films, C-spine.
BP's funky, 80 palp.

133
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:16,316
Gave him two units O-neg. The name
on this notebook says Rodney Price.

134
00:07:16,486 --> 00:07:19,527
There's a mass in the upper left
quadrant. Abdomen is distended.

135
00:07:19,702 --> 00:07:20,734
Crit's falling, 26.

136
00:07:20,913 --> 00:07:24,037
Bleeding internally. I'll hang
another unit on the rapid infuser.

137
00:07:24,212 --> 00:07:26,920
- He ruptured his spleen.
- Biggest spleen I've ever felt.

138
00:07:27,093 --> 00:07:29,302
- Got the wet reads.
- Great.

139
00:07:30,267 --> 00:07:31,347
Here's the shadow.

140
00:07:31,561 --> 00:07:34,650
That's the hematoma pressing down
on the splenic flexure.

141
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,486
- Looks like a rupture.
- No, no.

142
00:07:36,697 --> 00:07:38,324
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

143
00:07:38,535 --> 00:07:39,699
The film's mislabeled.

144
00:07:39,913 --> 00:07:43,416
The gastric bubble is under the right
diaphragm instead of the left.

145
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,966
But with a splenic rupture,
the gastric bubble can be displaced.

146
00:07:47,178 --> 00:07:49,257
No, no, no.
Not that much it can't...

147
00:07:49,476 --> 00:07:52,848
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute!
That's not his spleen. That's his liver.

148
00:07:53,025 --> 00:07:54,521
The liver's in the wrong place.

149
00:07:54,695 --> 00:07:57,105
- Backwards?
- His abdominal organs are reversed.

150
00:07:57,326 --> 00:07:58,358
That's remarkable.

151
00:07:58,537 --> 00:08:00,497
Let's get him up to Surgery! Move!

152
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:02,246
Ever do a case like this before?

153
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,249
No. This is one in a million.

154
00:08:04,467 --> 00:08:06,509
All right, everybody. Page Romano!

155
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,352
- You have previous clinic experience?
- A little.

156
00:08:09,561 --> 00:08:11,935
- Where would that have been?
- Chart Review.

157
00:08:12,108 --> 00:08:14,187
You don't see many patients
in Chart Review.

158
00:08:14,363 --> 00:08:16,025
No. But I know a lot about them.

159
00:08:16,201 --> 00:08:18,279
We'll have to double up
on patients in here.

160
00:08:18,455 --> 00:08:21,080
- Be with you in a minute.
- You said that an hour ago.

161
00:08:21,254 --> 00:08:24,211
Sign in patients, start a chart,
and check their vitals.

162
00:08:24,385 --> 00:08:25,715
- Where?
- Out here.

163
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:30,306
If anyone seems the least bit emergent,
take them over to ER Triage.

164
00:08:30,524 --> 00:08:31,806
Can you handle that?

165
00:08:32,152 --> 00:08:34,824
- If I have any questions, I'll holler.
- Great. Mark!

166
00:08:34,992 --> 00:08:36,868
Oh, bring the kid out here, please.

167
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:39,198
- Do you have a sec?
- I gotta get to Radiology.

168
00:08:39,376 --> 00:08:42,880
But I got a triple failure otitis media
that needs a scrip for Augmentin.

169
00:08:43,092 --> 00:08:45,171
All right. How's it going, Carol?

170
00:08:45,389 --> 00:08:47,765
You know, I would've been
organized by next week.

171
00:08:48,813 --> 00:08:51,023
You couldn't help me at all today?

172
00:08:51,236 --> 00:08:53,776
Well, it's a little busy
not having Doug here.

173
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:57,199
- But I'll see what I can do.
- All right. I appreciate it.

174
00:08:58,168 --> 00:09:01,457
- I think Carol's mad at me.
- No. She's just got a lot on her mind.

175
00:09:01,633 --> 00:09:04,590
That hospital lawyer dropped off
these papers for you to sign.

176
00:09:04,765 --> 00:09:06,891
They're urgent,
about the civil rights case.

177
00:09:07,062 --> 00:09:09,187
- File them in my box.
- Along with the others?

178
00:09:09,358 --> 00:09:11,817
Yeah. I'm not gonna let
these bastards get to me.

179
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,702
The man of the hour's arrived.

180
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,329
- This is the situs inversus?
- It sure is.

181
00:09:17,501 --> 00:09:20,921
Fantastic case, Peter. I've never
seen one in the flesh before.

182
00:09:21,134 --> 00:09:22,928
It's worth considering a case report.

183
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:25,679
I'm actually thinking of running
a literature review.

184
00:09:25,853 --> 00:09:29,689
I took the liberty. There's nothing
on abdominal situs inversus in Trauma.

185
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:31,856
I can be the first to write about it.

186
00:09:32,033 --> 00:09:35,406
I just heard the good news.
You've got a nose for sniffing out zebras.

187
00:09:35,582 --> 00:09:37,708
I wish I could take credit,
but he landed it.

188
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:40,967
- Finders, keepers.
- Peter won't mind you scrubbing in.

189
00:09:41,136 --> 00:09:43,891
- Give us a chance to work together.
- I think he might.

190
00:09:45,228 --> 00:09:46,344
No. No. Of course not.

191
00:09:46,565 --> 00:09:47,597
Great.

192
00:09:47,776 --> 00:09:50,352
You both can run it.
I'll hang out on the sidelines...

193
00:09:50,531 --> 00:09:53,655
...in case I have to take one of you out.
Shall we scrub?

194
00:09:56,586 --> 00:09:57,619
So...

195
00:09:58,132 --> 00:10:00,211
Don't you think it's time
we called a truce?

196
00:10:00,428 --> 00:10:02,304
I am not at war.

197
00:10:02,516 --> 00:10:05,272
I feel terrible.
I didn't mean to mislead you...

198
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,064
- ... about my family.
- It's not that big a deal, okay?

199
00:10:08,237 --> 00:10:10,113
- No hard feelings?
- No.

200
00:10:10,618 --> 00:10:12,909
Excuse me, John.
I hope I'm not interrupting.

201
00:10:13,123 --> 00:10:15,700
- Henry! What are you doing here?
- I wanna thank you...

202
00:10:15,878 --> 00:10:18,967
...for giving me time
to finish my brain blots.

203
00:10:19,136 --> 00:10:21,261
- Grab the end of that, please.
- The end?

204
00:10:21,474 --> 00:10:24,930
The results are so promising, I got
a Howard Hughes Research Fellowship.

205
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:26,479
- Glad I could help.
- You did.

206
00:10:26,694 --> 00:10:30,364
I was wondering if you might
do me one more favor here.

207
00:10:30,578 --> 00:10:33,666
- Favor, huh?
- See, I'm not able to- Excuse me.

208
00:10:33,876 --> 00:10:37,831
I can't start a new rotation until you
remove these UEs from my evaluation.

209
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,388
So if you could just...

210
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,134
"Unable to evaluate
physical examination.

211
00:10:42,353 --> 00:10:44,847
Unable to evaluate technical
and procedural skills.

212
00:10:45,026 --> 00:10:47,864
Unable to evaluate interactions
with the health care team. "

213
00:10:48,032 --> 00:10:49,742
Yeah. You can't just pass me?

214
00:10:50,371 --> 00:10:51,867
No. You barely showed up.

215
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:55,878
Then the registrar says that I need
to repeat this clerkship until I pass.

216
00:10:56,217 --> 00:10:58,046
Anna, you don't have a student,
do you?

217
00:10:58,221 --> 00:10:59,421
Don't need one.

218
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,600
Well, then, I guess
it's just you and me.

219
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,528
Jeanie, I've been looking for you.

220
00:11:07,704 --> 00:11:09,035
Well, you found me.

221
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,408
Good news.

222
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:14,543
Atlanta Memorial called.
They're very interested in you.

223
00:11:14,763 --> 00:11:18,682
I faxed an excellent recommendation.
You should be a shoo-in for a position.

224
00:11:18,897 --> 00:11:20,560
Thank you.

225
00:11:21,112 --> 00:11:25,697
Jeanie, if there were any way I could
change things, believe me, I would.

226
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,911
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I know.

227
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:36,985
There is no way we can take
these people today.

228
00:11:37,157 --> 00:11:39,115
Come back next week,
they get priority.

229
00:11:39,285 --> 00:11:41,279
You refuse to give
the homeless physicals?

230
00:11:41,456 --> 00:11:44,745
I am not refusing. We don't
have any more appointments for today.

231
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,674
But I called two hours ago and a lady
said that this was a walk-in clinic day.

232
00:11:48,846 --> 00:11:50,175
Cynthia!

233
00:11:50,348 --> 00:11:52,759
Did you give permission
to bring in these people?

234
00:11:52,937 --> 00:11:54,349
I figured it would be okay.

235
00:11:54,522 --> 00:11:57,480
Are you a complete idiot?
Can't you see we're swamped already?

236
00:11:57,654 --> 00:11:59,198
- I'm sorry.
- What's going on?

237
00:11:59,366 --> 00:12:02,322
She invited the entire Hazelton Shelter
for free physicals.

238
00:12:02,539 --> 00:12:03,951
Carol, can I talk to you?

239
00:12:05,961 --> 00:12:08,170
So there was miscommunication.

240
00:12:08,341 --> 00:12:11,548
If you have a problem with Cynthia
or any employee in the future...

241
00:12:11,722 --> 00:12:16,021
...speak to them privately. Don't dress
them down in front of the entire ER.

242
00:12:17,191 --> 00:12:19,400
- Anything else?
- No.

243
00:12:22,644 --> 00:12:24,890
Liver's lacerated.
Excise the left lateral aspect.

244
00:12:25,067 --> 00:12:27,145
- Which anatomically is the right lobe.
- Correct.

245
00:12:27,363 --> 00:12:29,524
I don't know about you,
but I'm getting dizzy.

246
00:12:29,744 --> 00:12:33,282
- We should put a mirror on the ceiling.
- We could operate from my bedroom.

247
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:37,551
Get a photo from the other side.
Peter, expose the gallbladder.

248
00:12:38,638 --> 00:12:41,178
- Found any family on this kid yet?
- Not last I heard.

249
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:43,722
Get on it. I wanna get
releases for these photos.

250
00:12:43,941 --> 00:12:45,104
Liver's still bleeding.

251
00:12:45,277 --> 00:12:47,438
- You ever use an argon beam coagulator?
- No.

252
00:12:47,657 --> 00:12:50,151
Why don't I do the Pringle maneuver?

253
00:12:50,371 --> 00:12:51,486
Go for it.

254
00:12:51,665 --> 00:12:55,086
My colleague would love to get
some blood samples from this kid.

255
00:12:55,299 --> 00:12:56,414
Suction, please.

256
00:12:56,592 --> 00:12:57,674
All right.

257
00:12:59,182 --> 00:13:01,936
Here we go. All right. Heads up.

258
00:13:02,898 --> 00:13:06,236
Have Pathology pickle this. Bet no one's
ever seen a backwards liver.

259
00:13:06,405 --> 00:13:09,575
- We can play "Stump the Med Students. "
- Not to mention publishing.

260
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,657
- We discussed that.
- Are you up for it?

261
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:12,866
- I'm game.
- So am I.

262
00:13:13,044 --> 00:13:17,129
Excellent. We'll fight over whose name
goes first on the papers later.

263
00:13:17,303 --> 00:13:18,467
It's a wrist.

264
00:13:18,681 --> 00:13:20,725
That's definitely
a fracture of the wrist.

265
00:13:20,937 --> 00:13:23,857
Yeah. But there are eight bones
in the wrist. Which one?

266
00:13:25,488 --> 00:13:27,946
What are the odds
of catching TB in this place?

267
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,622
Henry, which bone is broken?

268
00:13:29,831 --> 00:13:32,205
- It's the lunate.
- No. That's over here.

269
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,878
Here. Remember this, would you?
It's a mnemonic.

270
00:13:35,343 --> 00:13:39,558
Never Lower Tillie's Pants.
Mother May Come Home.

271
00:13:39,768 --> 00:13:42,061
Maybe you boys should talk privately.

272
00:13:42,608 --> 00:13:43,938
No, I'm just...

273
00:13:44,236 --> 00:13:46,197
...teaching Henry
the bones in the wrist.

274
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:48,860
Here.

275
00:13:49,498 --> 00:13:52,253
"M" for "Mother" is
the greater multangular.

276
00:13:52,463 --> 00:13:55,918
You call that the multangular?
I was taught it was the trapezium.

277
00:13:56,096 --> 00:13:58,506
- Really?
- I call that the scaphoid.

278
00:13:58,684 --> 00:14:00,763
- What do you call it?
- Navicular.

279
00:14:02,276 --> 00:14:05,399
So my little mnemonic
wouldn't work for you.

280
00:14:05,575 --> 00:14:08,248
- That's okay. I have my own.
- Really? Let's hear it.

281
00:14:09,876 --> 00:14:10,907
Okay.

282
00:14:13,443 --> 00:14:14,939
Scared Lovers...

283
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:19,700
...Try Positions That They Can't Handle.

284
00:14:20,121 --> 00:14:22,116
- Go with Anna's.
- He already learned yours.

285
00:14:22,293 --> 00:14:23,324
I like yours better.

286
00:14:23,503 --> 00:14:26,176
I don't think that I need either.
I'll just...

287
00:14:27,051 --> 00:14:28,167
...memorize the names.

288
00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:33,265
Excuse me.

289
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:39,518
If Dr. Anspaugh calls, tell him I'll
have this budget in his hands today.

290
00:14:39,989 --> 00:14:41,949
- Do you know who left this note?
- No.

291
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,535
- "CH". That's me.
- Dr. Weaver?

292
00:14:44,707 --> 00:14:46,702
You drive a Plymouth?
Your lights are on.

293
00:14:46,878 --> 00:14:48,292
That's hard to believe.

294
00:14:48,466 --> 00:14:51,136
Herb Spivak, snakebite
to the upper left torso.

295
00:14:51,303 --> 00:14:52,680
- Know what the venom is?
- No.

296
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,686
It has feet like a piranha,
and a head the size of a papaya.

297
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:58,693
Can you take this non-venomous
snakebite to the left thorax?

298
00:14:58,861 --> 00:15:01,352
- I left my car lights on.
- Sure. Curtain Area 3.

299
00:15:01,531 --> 00:15:04,489
Can you sign off on this budget?
Anspaugh's expecting it.

300
00:15:04,663 --> 00:15:07,336
- Where?
- Below my signature. I'll be back.

301
00:15:07,503 --> 00:15:08,584
How did this happen?

302
00:15:08,796 --> 00:15:10,541
I was feeding his python. It bit me.

303
00:15:10,717 --> 00:15:12,546
What do you expect?
You spilled soup.

304
00:15:12,721 --> 00:15:13,967
- Who are you?
- Gary Lomax.

305
00:15:14,182 --> 00:15:16,094
Owner of Jungle Gary's Reptorium.

306
00:15:16,312 --> 00:15:18,520
- He spilled chicken soup on himself.
- What?

307
00:15:18,691 --> 00:15:21,363
Pythons love chicken,
so I dipped the rat in my soup.

308
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,942
It spilled on my jacket.
Bingo! The guy got me.

309
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,576
Python thought he was
the world's biggest chicken.

310
00:15:28,712 --> 00:15:29,828
Ellis?

311
00:15:30,549 --> 00:15:32,091
Fancy meeting you here!

312
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,880
Security said my lights were on.

313
00:15:34,055 --> 00:15:37,808
A little ruse to get you out so I could
thank you for getting us the contract.

314
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,939
- Anspaugh approved it?
- Ink's still wet.

315
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:43,736
Synergix is now supplying extra
Attending coverage to County General.

316
00:15:43,907 --> 00:15:46,782
- All because of you.
- Why didn't you come into the hospital?

317
00:15:46,955 --> 00:15:49,745
I wanted to avoid suggestion
of preferential treatment.

318
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,413
It's not preferential treatment.
It's good business.

319
00:15:52,592 --> 00:15:56,464
We have that in common. It's good
business for me to say thanks.

320
00:15:59,188 --> 00:16:00,731
- Thanks, Kerry.
- Phalaenopsis.

321
00:16:00,941 --> 00:16:02,935
Ellis, you shouldn't have.

322
00:16:03,112 --> 00:16:04,858
- You know phals?
- I love them.

323
00:16:05,284 --> 00:16:06,863
Something else we have in common.

324
00:16:09,042 --> 00:16:11,831
Great job. You really drained
the hell out of that liver.

325
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:15,342
Once I got my bearings, it wasn't
difficult. I'm glad it came along.

326
00:16:15,512 --> 00:16:18,386
Me too. But a compass
would've been helpful.

327
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,931
Check the crits and coags. Make sure
the Jackson Pratts don't clot off.

328
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:23,653
Catalog the photos and dig up...

329
00:16:23,821 --> 00:16:26,575
...every article you can find
on situs inversus viscerum.

330
00:16:26,744 --> 00:16:30,197
I'll watch the temp. If it drops below 35,
I'll use a warming blanket.

331
00:16:30,374 --> 00:16:33,212
I'll alert the Genetics Department,
if they want to consult.

332
00:16:33,422 --> 00:16:36,297
Dr. Romano, this is Mr. Price.
Rodney's father.

333
00:16:36,513 --> 00:16:37,794
The school called.

334
00:16:38,015 --> 00:16:40,639
Told me there was an accident,
to come right over.

335
00:16:41,689 --> 00:16:42,721
How is my boy doing?

336
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:45,476
We removed part of his liver
to control the bleeding.

337
00:16:45,655 --> 00:16:48,409
He's in serious condition
but he came out of surgery well.

338
00:16:48,618 --> 00:16:50,199
Aren't you...

339
00:16:50,415 --> 00:16:51,827
...Peter Benton?

340
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:53,836
- From Collins High?
- Yeah.

341
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:56,587
Isaac Price.

342
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,222
You two were classmates?

343
00:16:58,432 --> 00:17:01,470
Yeah. Class of '83.
Peter was on that college track.

344
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:02,935
Nose to the grindstone.

345
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:05,771
It paid off. Your son had
an excellent surgeon.

346
00:17:06,447 --> 00:17:09,984
Isaac, is your son on any medication
or allergic to any drugs?

347
00:17:10,203 --> 00:17:11,450
I don't know.

348
00:17:12,543 --> 00:17:14,288
He lives at his mother's.

349
00:17:15,965 --> 00:17:17,759
Listen, is Rodney gonna be all right?

350
00:17:19,347 --> 00:17:21,176
You know, we're doing our best, man.

351
00:17:25,568 --> 00:17:26,599
Damn it. Damn it.

352
00:17:26,778 --> 00:17:29,070
- Can I help?
- No. You've done plenty. Thanks.

353
00:17:29,286 --> 00:17:32,073
Carol, move your patients
out of the Admit area.

354
00:17:32,288 --> 00:17:34,285
We could get cited
for blocking fire exits.

355
00:17:34,461 --> 00:17:36,869
Dr. Doyle, did you want
your December meal tickets?

356
00:17:37,047 --> 00:17:38,843
- Who has time to eat?
- I'll take them.

357
00:17:39,011 --> 00:17:42,014
- They're for the residents.
- You heard. Who has time to eat?

358
00:17:43,561 --> 00:17:47,267
You're going to need
a tetanus booster, antibiotics.

359
00:17:47,487 --> 00:17:49,814
And I'll have to extract
those python teeth.

360
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:52,740
- Okay, doctor.
- Malik, can you get me some Betadine?

361
00:17:52,955 --> 00:17:54,951
I brought Flora along...

362
00:17:55,169 --> 00:17:57,660
- ... in case you wanted to swab her.
- Flora?

363
00:17:57,881 --> 00:18:00,841
- She's actually quite gentle-
- When she's not hungry.

364
00:18:01,055 --> 00:18:02,170
How do you know?

365
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:06,053
- She's harmless except for mouth rot.
- You think we should get a culture?

366
00:18:06,231 --> 00:18:08,903
I love her dearly.
But her mouth's a cesspool.

367
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,104
Malik...

368
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:12,069
...you wanna give him a hand?

369
00:18:12,286 --> 00:18:13,661
I don't think so.

370
00:18:13,871 --> 00:18:16,247
Just grab her middle. Don't let go.

371
00:18:23,851 --> 00:18:27,389
This next case of situs inversus...

372
00:18:27,942 --> 00:18:31,314
...apparently shows
no cardiac involvement.

373
00:18:31,532 --> 00:18:32,944
Dr. Benton.

374
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,870
This is a great teaching case.

375
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,408
I discussed it with the residents
and students.

376
00:18:37,627 --> 00:18:40,798
Dr. Benton and Dr. Corday
performed the surgery.

377
00:18:40,968 --> 00:18:43,970
Photographs were taken.
Everybody would love to see them.

378
00:18:44,181 --> 00:18:46,640
We need to change
the patient's dressings.

379
00:18:46,812 --> 00:18:48,973
No problem. We'll come back later.

380
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:52,854
This is great work, Peter.
Don't forget those photos.

381
00:18:53,658 --> 00:18:55,819
- Anspaugh's impressed.
- Yeah. Here.

382
00:18:55,997 --> 00:18:58,871
- How's the kid doing?
- He's stable. Here.

383
00:19:00,464 --> 00:19:02,174
Lucky break, the father knowing you.

384
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:04,966
Should make it easier to consent him
for blood tests.

385
00:19:05,643 --> 00:19:09,262
Genetic breakthroughs are hovering in
the winds. You'll talk to the family?

386
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:11,433
- Yeah.
- Yeah, great.

387
00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:15,316
- Peter, is something wrong?
- No.

388
00:19:15,952 --> 00:19:18,874
- I'd be happy to talk to the father.
- Why?

389
00:19:19,377 --> 00:19:22,215
I thought it might be more comfortable
since you know him.

390
00:19:22,383 --> 00:19:24,792
I don't know him.
What difference would it make?

391
00:19:24,971 --> 00:19:27,097
It's tough if you have
a personal connection.

392
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,551
I don't have a personal connection.

393
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:32,894
I don't want him to think
we're using his kid.

394
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:35,399
We've treated him as best we can,
haven't we?

395
00:19:35,659 --> 00:19:38,413
- Yeah.
- Then you've got nothing to worry about.

396
00:19:44,969 --> 00:19:47,927
- Excuse me.
- My fault. I'm not used to the floor plan.

397
00:19:48,101 --> 00:19:51,936
- I don't think we've met. I'm Jeanie.
- Yosh Takata. New R.N.

398
00:19:53,236 --> 00:19:54,897
The new R.N.?

399
00:19:55,531 --> 00:19:57,610
How'd you get past the hiring freeze?

400
00:19:58,078 --> 00:20:01,997
I didn't know there was one.
I put in for a transfer to the ER.

401
00:20:02,212 --> 00:20:05,215
- How long you been here? Do you like it?
- Two years. I do.

402
00:20:06,304 --> 00:20:08,215
It's good to meet you. I gotta run.

403
00:20:11,395 --> 00:20:14,068
- How did you get these scars?
- Defending a cave diver.

404
00:20:14,277 --> 00:20:16,354
We got caught in a kelp forest.
Do you dive?

405
00:20:16,573 --> 00:20:19,447
- No.
- Oh, spectacular.

406
00:20:20,455 --> 00:20:22,167
When did you start handling snakes?

407
00:20:22,336 --> 00:20:23,878
He's defending me in a lawsuit.

408
00:20:24,088 --> 00:20:25,667
- Oh, you're an attorney.
- Yeah.

409
00:20:25,883 --> 00:20:28,128
Flora ate his neighbor's
Jack Russell terrier.

410
00:20:28,347 --> 00:20:30,341
Obviously, they have
no case whatsoever.

411
00:20:30,517 --> 00:20:32,976
They're not recognized
by the American Kennel Association.

412
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:36,768
Gary offered to help me work with
snakes in exchange for legal counsel.

413
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:38,526
How could I refuse such an offer?

414
00:20:41,832 --> 00:20:43,292
Sure, Al. I know.

415
00:20:43,502 --> 00:20:46,340
I know. Okay. I love you too. Bye.

416
00:20:48,178 --> 00:20:49,459
- You okay?
- Yeah.

417
00:20:49,638 --> 00:20:52,310
Just Al. Foreman job
in Atlanta fell through.

418
00:20:52,477 --> 00:20:54,556
I'm sorry. Does he have
other possibilities?

419
00:20:54,774 --> 00:20:57,182
Al always does.
Let me give you a hand.

420
00:20:57,361 --> 00:20:58,906
- Thanks.
- How's it going for you?

421
00:20:59,074 --> 00:21:02,529
Lousy. I don't know why I thought
I could run a clinic with no supplies.

422
00:21:02,707 --> 00:21:05,199
- I can't even write a scrip.
- P.A.'s can write them.

423
00:21:05,378 --> 00:21:08,336
But Kerry Weaver won't let me
use any of the ER staff.

424
00:21:08,509 --> 00:21:10,054
What's she gonna do? Fire me?

425
00:21:12,481 --> 00:21:13,646
Mark.

426
00:21:14,821 --> 00:21:17,149
You are so romantic.

427
00:21:17,327 --> 00:21:18,406
I am?

428
00:21:21,126 --> 00:21:22,871
Hiding that note under the charts.

429
00:21:23,089 --> 00:21:25,843
My heart skipped a beat
when I saw my initials.

430
00:21:26,054 --> 00:21:29,093
- What?
- On the envelope. "CH"?

431
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:31,852
What you wrote was really sexy.

432
00:21:32,025 --> 00:21:34,019
- Did you mean it?
- Yeah, sure.

433
00:21:34,194 --> 00:21:37,035
Well, then my answer is yes. I will.

434
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,383
Everything okay?

435
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:49,761
Well, we just got some labs back.

436
00:21:51,148 --> 00:21:54,236
Rodney's crit is okay.
But his platelets are falling.

437
00:21:54,571 --> 00:21:57,411
We're concerned that his blood
might not clot properly.

438
00:21:57,789 --> 00:21:59,496
Is he gonna pull through?

439
00:21:59,707 --> 00:22:01,120
Well, he...

440
00:22:01,336 --> 00:22:05,423
He may need to have a transfusion. But
don't worry. I'll keep an eye on him.

441
00:22:06,473 --> 00:22:08,016
Thanks, Peter.

442
00:22:08,184 --> 00:22:10,262
I know you're doing
everything you can, man.

443
00:22:10,438 --> 00:22:13,194
All the doctors have been in,
making sure he's all right.

444
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:20,418
Isaac, are you aware that Rodney
has a rare genetic syndrome...

445
00:22:20,628 --> 00:22:23,122
...that caused his abdominal organs
to be reversed?

446
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,214
Is that why he's so sick?

447
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:29,016
No. But when he was hit by the car,
his liver was severely injured.

448
00:22:29,186 --> 00:22:30,219
See...

449
00:22:30,733 --> 00:22:34,070
If it had been in the proper position,
the prognosis might be better.

450
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:41,587
Listen, I...

451
00:22:42,048 --> 00:22:46,095
I know it's not easy at times
like this to ask, but...

452
00:22:48,603 --> 00:22:51,941
...we'd like permission to draw
some of Rodney's blood...

453
00:22:52,111 --> 00:22:55,030
...along with yours and your ex-wife's
to do a genetic study.

454
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:57,071
Yeah, okay.

455
00:22:57,873 --> 00:23:01,128
I'll do anything if it'll
help Rodney get better.

456
00:23:04,639 --> 00:23:07,213
Here. You need to sign the consent.

457
00:23:18,787 --> 00:23:23,700
On a scale of one to 10,
how would you rate your pain?

458
00:23:24,087 --> 00:23:25,583
Oh, I don't know.

459
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:28,966
When you push like that,
it's a nine or an eight.

460
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:31,966
But it could be a six or a seven.
I'm not sure.

461
00:23:32,642 --> 00:23:35,216
Ask him to describe
the quality of the pain.

462
00:23:37,065 --> 00:23:40,731
Mr. Kottmeier, please describe
the quality of your pain.

463
00:23:40,904 --> 00:23:41,938
Quality?

464
00:23:42,157 --> 00:23:44,944
Is it dull? Is it sharp?
Is it crampy? Is it constant?

465
00:23:45,161 --> 00:23:49,077
It's crampy, all right.
But sometimes it's sharp too.

466
00:23:49,459 --> 00:23:52,378
When it's not dull. I'm not sure.

467
00:23:52,547 --> 00:23:54,457
I'm a double Libra.
You know how that is.

468
00:23:54,676 --> 00:23:56,967
Not that I believe in horoscopes.

469
00:23:57,223 --> 00:23:59,015
That appears sharp to me.

470
00:23:59,225 --> 00:24:02,262
We're dealing with diverticulitis.
What do you wanna do?

471
00:24:03,273 --> 00:24:06,857
Well, that could be surgical or not.

472
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,653
Order an abdominal ultrasound
or maybe get a CT. I'm not sure.

473
00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:14,492
Why don't we just start
with a history and a physical?

474
00:24:18,088 --> 00:24:20,496
Can you write me a scrip
for erythromycin ointment?

475
00:24:20,675 --> 00:24:22,669
I got a kid with conjunctivitis.

476
00:24:22,845 --> 00:24:25,336
Having you here today has been
a saving grace to me.

477
00:24:25,557 --> 00:24:26,756
Thanks.

478
00:24:27,227 --> 00:24:29,979
You worked hard to get this
going. I wish I had your guts.

479
00:24:30,188 --> 00:24:32,063
You gotta fight
for what you believe in.

480
00:24:32,234 --> 00:24:34,477
What if you don't have
the ammunition?

481
00:24:34,696 --> 00:24:35,895
Look for it.

482
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,289
- That won't hurt him, will it?
- No.

483
00:24:49,094 --> 00:24:52,380
Give me 5 units of platelets and FFP.
500 units of heparin! Move!

484
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,007
- Peter, what's wrong?
- His blood's not clotting.

485
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:57,721
- What's going on?
- Oh, my God!

486
00:24:58,318 --> 00:25:01,271
He went into DIC.
I'm bolusing 500 of heparin.

487
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,364
He's bradycardic.

488
00:25:04,783 --> 00:25:07,193
Lungs are wet.
Put him on 100% oxygen.

489
00:25:07,414 --> 00:25:08,493
His stats are falling!

490
00:25:08,665 --> 00:25:10,955
- Pulmonary hemorrhage.
- Get him on his stomach.

491
00:25:11,128 --> 00:25:12,670
Here we go, people. On my count.

492
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:14,755
One, two, three!

493
00:25:14,925 --> 00:25:15,957
What's happening here?

494
00:25:16,136 --> 00:25:17,843
His lungs are filling with blood.

495
00:25:18,053 --> 00:25:20,892
- Jesus, please.
- Isaac, you gotta stand back.

496
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:22,644
You've gotta stand back, man.

497
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:23,844
Please.

498
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:28,151
He's in asystole! Amp of epi!
We gotta get him turned back over.

499
00:25:28,362 --> 00:25:32,444
Here we go. On my count.
One, two, three, move!

500
00:25:32,828 --> 00:25:34,536
Gotta start CPR.

501
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,841
- Connie, have you seen Cynthia?
- She's on a break.

502
00:25:42,009 --> 00:25:45,094
- Do you know if she left her purse?
- I don't know.

503
00:25:46,348 --> 00:25:47,678
She really likes you.

504
00:25:47,852 --> 00:25:49,429
Oh, yeah. We're just having fun.

505
00:25:49,603 --> 00:25:52,311
You gave her a diamond.
That's serious fun.

506
00:25:55,488 --> 00:25:56,519
What are you doing?

507
00:25:56,697 --> 00:25:59,237
- Nothing. I just lost my pen.
- Here.

508
00:25:59,452 --> 00:26:02,074
- You sign off on the budget?
- I found an error.

509
00:26:02,832 --> 00:26:03,863
- Really?
- Yeah.

510
00:26:04,084 --> 00:26:07,869
Here it has your salary
500 dollars more a week than mine.

511
00:26:08,089 --> 00:26:11,591
That's remuneration for my
taking over administrative duties...

512
00:26:11,804 --> 00:26:14,214
...until Morgenstern returns,
God willing.

513
00:26:14,435 --> 00:26:15,596
$25,000 a year?

514
00:26:15,809 --> 00:26:19,561
You signed off on this three months ago.
Why didn't you say something?

515
00:26:19,733 --> 00:26:21,941
I guess I just wasn't paying attention.

516
00:26:24,908 --> 00:26:27,780
Hey, Jeanie, have you seen
a chart for Kottmeier?

517
00:26:27,996 --> 00:26:31,165
- No.
- Guess I'll start a new one.

518
00:26:32,878 --> 00:26:36,581
And have you traveled
anywhere recently?

519
00:26:36,801 --> 00:26:39,174
I just did.
Louisville, to visit the in-laws.

520
00:26:39,388 --> 00:26:41,383
And then to...

521
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:44,437
Time to wrap up. History
and physical just took 90 minutes.

522
00:26:44,605 --> 00:26:47,643
Shave an hour off, you'd be
in passing range for this clerkship.

523
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:50,357
There's a rectal abscess in 2
with your name on it.

524
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:52,608
Mr. Kottmeier,
someone will see you shortly.

525
00:26:52,827 --> 00:26:56,161
- It would've gone faster if my allergies-
- Take an antihistamine.

526
00:26:58,752 --> 00:27:00,128
Hi, Mr. Kottmeier.

527
00:27:00,296 --> 00:27:03,050
I'm Dr. Del Amico.
I'm gonna examine you.

528
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:06,012
Boy, when they said shortly,
they mean shortly!

529
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:09,177
This new clinic's a godsend.
I work part-time. No benefits.

530
00:27:09,393 --> 00:27:10,937
So thank you.

531
00:27:11,146 --> 00:27:13,603
No. Thank you for saying that.

532
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:15,729
There you go, Hector.

533
00:27:16,071 --> 00:27:18,563
That shot will keep you
from getting sick.

534
00:27:18,783 --> 00:27:21,537
If it's not too much trouble,
could you look at his chin?

535
00:27:21,745 --> 00:27:24,202
He crabs about it,
but I don't see anything wrong.

536
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:25,453
Sure.

537
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:28,626
Okay, Hector.
Does it hurt when I do this?

538
00:27:28,842 --> 00:27:30,216
I can't feel it.

539
00:27:31,635 --> 00:27:34,009
- You don't feel me pressing on it?
- No.

540
00:27:34,183 --> 00:27:35,214
No?

541
00:27:35,683 --> 00:27:38,438
Okay, I'm gonna go see
if I can find a doctor.

542
00:27:40,274 --> 00:27:44,143
High-dose epi! Seven cc's, one to
a thousand! Another mg of atropine!

543
00:27:44,364 --> 00:27:45,444
We got a blip!

544
00:27:45,656 --> 00:27:47,283
- Was it a pulse?
- No pulse.

545
00:27:47,451 --> 00:27:50,574
Maybe he's got fluid around the heart.
Pericardiocentesis needle.

546
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,918
Flatline. An epi can cause
a few transient heartbeats.

547
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:57,706
Damn! No blood.

548
00:27:57,928 --> 00:28:01,678
All right. Epi drip wide open
and more platelets. Let's go!

549
00:28:02,684 --> 00:28:04,060
Peter, it's been 20 minutes.

550
00:28:04,895 --> 00:28:05,928
Peter!

551
00:28:11,613 --> 00:28:12,646
Peter.

552
00:28:33,439 --> 00:28:35,350
Time of death, 4:52.

553
00:28:57,226 --> 00:29:01,143
Get him up to CT. Keep the C-collar on
until Radiology clears the C-spine.

554
00:29:01,358 --> 00:29:03,896
- You want films?
- No. The neurosurgeon will take them.

555
00:29:04,071 --> 00:29:07,820
- Kerry, I'd like a minute with you.
- Sure. Jeanie, what is it?

556
00:29:08,034 --> 00:29:09,825
I wanna take a look at the budget.

557
00:29:10,246 --> 00:29:12,324
- The ER budget?
- That's right. Yeah.

558
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:14,702
I've told you.
It's nothing personal.

559
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:18,836
I tried everything to try and keep you
here. The numbers don't support it.

560
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:21,301
If I'm being fired,
I wanna see the numbers...

561
00:29:21,473 --> 00:29:23,428
...not hear your interpretation of them.

562
00:29:23,598 --> 00:29:25,975
I've gone over them
with a fine-tooth comb.

563
00:29:26,147 --> 00:29:28,020
It's not fair,
but that's the way it is.

564
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:30,185
How do you justify
hiring a new nurse?

565
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:33,947
Yosh Takata was hired to replace
two nurses who've left.

566
00:29:34,826 --> 00:29:36,535
What about giving yourself a raise?

567
00:29:37,496 --> 00:29:39,040
Salaries are confidential.

568
00:29:40,127 --> 00:29:41,289
I sure as hell know why.

569
00:29:45,218 --> 00:29:48,718
- Jeanie, I'm sorry I can't help you.
- I'll find someone who can.

570
00:29:49,557 --> 00:29:50,588
Hey, Carter.

571
00:29:50,767 --> 00:29:53,853
Have you had a patient complain
about his chin falling asleep?

572
00:29:54,063 --> 00:29:55,476
Heads up, Henry. No.

573
00:29:55,651 --> 00:29:57,808
I'm sure if it's contagious,
he'll catch it.

574
00:29:57,985 --> 00:30:00,777
- Where are you going?
- Mr. Kottmeier's my patient.

575
00:30:00,951 --> 00:30:02,779
Then why did I do a physical on him?

576
00:30:02,954 --> 00:30:04,576
I'm quite fond of all of you.

577
00:30:04,745 --> 00:30:07,502
You did remember to sign him out
on the board, didn't you?

578
00:30:07,712 --> 00:30:10,083
- Was I supposed to?
- Where are you taking him?

579
00:30:10,256 --> 00:30:14,126
To the surgical ward. Mr. Kottmeier
has an inflamed diverticulum...

580
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:17,597
...that perfed into his mesentery.
He needs a colectomy.

581
00:30:17,808 --> 00:30:20,301
Hold on. Have you
considered medical management?

582
00:30:20,521 --> 00:30:24,474
Treat the abscess with a course of Flagyl
and Cipro before jumping into surgery?

583
00:30:24,694 --> 00:30:27,366
- I'm willing to give it a shot.
- No, no, no, wait.

584
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:29,901
Do you agree because
you think I wanna hear that?

585
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:31,820
Or do you really believe that?

586
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:33,071
What?

587
00:30:33,751 --> 00:30:36,289
I don't want you agreeing with me
just to please me.

588
00:30:36,506 --> 00:30:39,839
I'm not. I've already considered
several alternatives to surgery.

589
00:30:40,009 --> 00:30:41,292
- You have?
- Shut up, Henry!

590
00:30:43,433 --> 00:30:44,464
Mark.

591
00:30:44,852 --> 00:30:47,223
If you have a problem
with my salary, come to me.

592
00:30:47,396 --> 00:30:48,976
Don't bring it up with the staff.

593
00:30:49,191 --> 00:30:51,897
Do you have any idea how many
hours I work every week?

594
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:53,350
What are you talking about?

595
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:56,652
- You disclosed our salaries to Jeanie.
- No, I didn't.

596
00:30:56,869 --> 00:30:58,447
- You didn't?
- No.

597
00:30:59,249 --> 00:31:01,575
What happened to all
the patients in your clinic?

598
00:31:01,753 --> 00:31:04,589
I gave them meal tickets and
stashed them in the cafeteria.

599
00:31:04,756 --> 00:31:06,168
Stressful day for you, huh?

600
00:31:06,382 --> 00:31:09,257
- Tell me about it.
- Anything interesting in Doug's note?

601
00:31:09,473 --> 00:31:10,553
I wish I knew.

602
00:31:10,726 --> 00:31:13,298
- I lost it before I got to read it.
- That's too bad.

603
00:31:13,518 --> 00:31:15,930
- How are you on Medline searches?
- Why?

604
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:19,152
I did one on submandibular
paralysis and I came up with zilch.

605
00:31:19,363 --> 00:31:21,689
I'm not surprised.
I've never heard of it.

606
00:31:22,032 --> 00:31:25,284
I've got this kid complaining
of a numb chin. What should I do?

607
00:31:25,496 --> 00:31:27,289
Why don't you try "numb chin"?

608
00:31:28,875 --> 00:31:30,504
"Numb chin. "

609
00:31:31,215 --> 00:31:34,131
That sounds a little too,
you know, easy.

610
00:31:34,678 --> 00:31:36,174
Hey.

611
00:31:36,848 --> 00:31:38,557
There you go.

612
00:31:40,312 --> 00:31:41,640
I'm sorry, Isaac.

613
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,445
Can we have a word with you
in the hall?

614
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,243
I don't wanna leave my boy.

615
00:31:52,414 --> 00:31:54,822
We'd like your permission
to perform an autopsy.

616
00:31:55,835 --> 00:31:57,082
Why?

617
00:31:57,589 --> 00:31:59,463
Well, because it could be useful.

618
00:32:00,301 --> 00:32:01,760
Did something go wrong?

619
00:32:01,929 --> 00:32:03,754
He started bleeding when
you stuck him.

620
00:32:03,973 --> 00:32:06,811
No. His blood wouldn't clot
because of the liver injury.

621
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:10,557
- Then why do you need to do an autopsy?
- For research.

622
00:32:11,152 --> 00:32:12,612
It could be helpful.

623
00:32:14,531 --> 00:32:17,284
That's why you're so interested.
Not because he was hurt.

624
00:32:17,453 --> 00:32:19,695
No, no, no.
We were trying to save his life.

625
00:32:19,915 --> 00:32:23,165
When you took his blood and mine,
were you trying to save his life?

626
00:32:23,376 --> 00:32:25,171
- No-
- We'd like to study his condition.

627
00:32:25,381 --> 00:32:26,628
I don't want him studied.

628
00:32:26,801 --> 00:32:28,046
We understand how you-

629
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:32,301
Look at him! Don't you think
you cut him up enough?

630
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:34,059
- Isaac, I'm so sorry.
- No!

631
00:32:34,269 --> 00:32:36,808
I don't want you cutting up my son!

632
00:32:41,699 --> 00:32:43,858
You're right. I'm sorry.

633
00:32:47,124 --> 00:32:48,500
I'll leave you alone.

634
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:07,567
Focus, Henry. What do you hear?

635
00:33:11,536 --> 00:33:13,530
- I'm not- I'm not sure.
- What do you hear?

636
00:33:13,748 --> 00:33:16,240
He has a pneumothorax.
We'll put in a chest tube.

637
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,540
I'll grab a tray.

638
00:33:17,753 --> 00:33:20,376
- It hurts.
- Yeah. I bet it hurts.

639
00:33:20,592 --> 00:33:23,629
Hang on there. Everything will
feel better in a minute.

640
00:33:24,931 --> 00:33:28,766
Okay. Henry, the first thing that
you wanna do is feel for the ribs...

641
00:33:28,938 --> 00:33:31,941
...along the midaxillary line
locating the fifth interspace.

642
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,694
Can I get some Betadine?

643
00:33:34,947 --> 00:33:36,858
Where you make the incision.

644
00:33:37,076 --> 00:33:39,614
- I'm not feeling so good.
- What?

645
00:33:40,582 --> 00:33:41,780
I'm not feeling so good.

646
00:33:42,001 --> 00:33:44,458
Sit down.
Put your head between your knees.

647
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:46,122
Lily, give me the Kelly.

648
00:33:48,803 --> 00:33:50,463
How are you doing, Henry?

649
00:33:52,056 --> 00:33:54,726
Lydia, do me a favor and
slide Henry out of the way.

650
00:33:55,521 --> 00:33:58,144
- Carter, he's a little cyanotic.
- What?

651
00:33:59,443 --> 00:34:00,987
Can't get a pulse on the banger!

652
00:34:01,154 --> 00:34:02,983
Lydia, call an Attending!

653
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:07,402
Change the dressing twice a day. Think
twice before defending any skydivers.

654
00:34:07,622 --> 00:34:08,736
Thank you, doc.

655
00:34:08,957 --> 00:34:10,287
We need you in Trauma 1.

656
00:34:10,502 --> 00:34:12,579
Anna, Malik, we may need your help.

657
00:34:17,553 --> 00:34:19,715
- What happened?
- Banger had a tension pneumo.

658
00:34:19,892 --> 00:34:22,644
- Henry passed out.
- All right. I'll finish the chest tube.

659
00:34:22,854 --> 00:34:24,350
Get your student into Trauma 2.

660
00:34:24,566 --> 00:34:27,235
Okay. Henry, you're gonna be
just fine.

661
00:34:27,402 --> 00:34:28,647
Everybody grab hold.

662
00:34:28,862 --> 00:34:31,274
On my count. One, two, three.

663
00:34:31,828 --> 00:34:33,238
- What happened?
- I don't know.

664
00:34:33,454 --> 00:34:36,077
I showed him how to put in
a chest tube and he fainted.

665
00:34:36,249 --> 00:34:39,372
- Go on the other side.
- Wheezes bilaterally.

666
00:34:39,589 --> 00:34:40,619
Pulse ox is 86.

667
00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:43,048
I need to intubate.
Get me a laryngoscope.

668
00:34:43,261 --> 00:34:45,421
- Let's go!
- Did he complain of feeling sick?

669
00:34:45,598 --> 00:34:47,345
He always does.
He's a hypochondriac.

670
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:49,510
- Is he on any meds?
- Not that I know of.

671
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:53,146
Okay. Let's get a CBC, Chem-20,
and a tox screen.

672
00:34:53,986 --> 00:34:55,016
All right, I'm in.

673
00:34:55,236 --> 00:34:57,778
- Bag him.
- Pulse ox is worse. Down to 82.

674
00:34:57,993 --> 00:34:59,570
What? Get a blood gas.

675
00:34:59,785 --> 00:35:02,909
- Pressure's crashing!
- What the hell is going on?

676
00:35:03,332 --> 00:35:05,827
His wrist and his left hand
are red and edematous.

677
00:35:06,047 --> 00:35:07,422
Right hand's also swollen.

678
00:35:07,631 --> 00:35:10,882
Oh, my God!
He's allergic to latex. Okay.

679
00:35:11,094 --> 00:35:14,302
He's in asystole!
Amp of epi, IV push!

680
00:35:14,476 --> 00:35:16,849
ET tube cup has latex.
We've got to extubate.

681
00:35:17,063 --> 00:35:19,521
Lily, get me an ET tube
from the latex-free cart.

682
00:35:19,734 --> 00:35:20,766
Wash your hands first.

683
00:35:20,987 --> 00:35:23,026
Chuny, get me a basin of water.

684
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:27,322
- Found a non-latex ET tube.
- A mg of atropine and 50 of Benadryl!

685
00:35:28,415 --> 00:35:30,821
Laryngeal edema.
I'm having a hard time getting in.

686
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:33,287
- How long has he been down?
-30 seconds.

687
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:36,258
- Watch his teeth. Can you see the cords?
- I know. Barely.

688
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:38,925
All right, Malik. Hi-dose epi.
Seven cc's.

689
00:35:39,138 --> 00:35:43,090
You're doing great.
Just keep sliding it in very gently.

690
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:45,814
- I'm in.
- Great.

691
00:35:46,023 --> 00:35:47,188
Good job.

692
00:35:47,361 --> 00:35:48,736
Got a pulse.

693
00:35:49,112 --> 00:35:50,144
Everything okay here?

694
00:35:50,364 --> 00:35:52,025
Everything's under control.

695
00:35:54,622 --> 00:35:56,281
Peter, I'd like to speak to you.

696
00:35:56,499 --> 00:35:58,707
I'd like to speak to you as well.

697
00:36:01,965 --> 00:36:05,382
I've been reconsidering the possibility
of joining your team.

698
00:36:08,852 --> 00:36:12,102
I understand Mr. Price refused
an autopsy on his son.

699
00:36:12,272 --> 00:36:13,767
Did you try to convince him?

700
00:36:13,983 --> 00:36:15,978
He doesn't want us carving his boy.

701
00:36:16,154 --> 00:36:18,562
Did you explain how research
might benefit others?

702
00:36:18,741 --> 00:36:20,153
He doesn't want it.

703
00:36:20,368 --> 00:36:22,493
Give him some time. He's emotional.

704
00:36:24,375 --> 00:36:26,084
I don't feel comfortable doing that.

705
00:36:29,718 --> 00:36:33,383
How do you think we made advances
in heart surgery, in transplantation?

706
00:36:33,597 --> 00:36:36,601
By refining procedures on patients
and studying the results.

707
00:36:37,479 --> 00:36:41,265
That kid was a freak of nature. And we
have a responsibility to do research.

708
00:36:41,443 --> 00:36:43,520
That "freak" was a boy
named Rodney Price...

709
00:36:43,697 --> 00:36:46,106
...whose father doesn't understand
why he lost him.

710
00:36:46,283 --> 00:36:49,205
All you want to do is cut him
despite his father's wishes.

711
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:51,666
We're scientists, Peter.

712
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:57,502
We're not allowed sentimentality.
Now, you go back and get consent.

713
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,220
- Because I want it.
- No. You get somebody else to do it.

714
00:37:03,853 --> 00:37:07,058
I just got a lab report back on
one of my patients, a 7-year-old.

715
00:37:07,274 --> 00:37:09,648
Turns out he's got
acute lymphocytic leukemia.

716
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,531
A doctor should speak to the mother.

717
00:37:11,699 --> 00:37:14,237
- How did it present?
- Kid's complaint was a numb chin.

718
00:37:14,411 --> 00:37:16,404
I checked in the computer,
ran some tests.

719
00:37:16,581 --> 00:37:18,077
The mom knows you. Talk to her.

720
00:37:18,293 --> 00:37:20,617
Call me if she has any questions.

721
00:37:22,714 --> 00:37:25,634
And then I plea-bargained her down
to a misdemeanor...

722
00:37:25,845 --> 00:37:28,383
...not two weeks after
she shot a guy!

723
00:37:29,517 --> 00:37:33,137
You could've saved yourself a whole
bunch of urgent phone messages...

724
00:37:33,315 --> 00:37:35,143
...if you'd told me Herb was on board.

725
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:37,312
- I didn't know you knew each other.
- Yeah.

726
00:37:37,487 --> 00:37:39,945
I served on the Trial Lawyers'
Banquet Committee.

727
00:37:40,118 --> 00:37:41,196
Herb was our speaker.

728
00:37:41,369 --> 00:37:43,694
I've been filling him in
on that Law family suit.

729
00:37:43,872 --> 00:37:45,666
You got yourself
quite a little mess.

730
00:37:45,877 --> 00:37:47,999
I've decided to ignore
the whole thing.

731
00:37:48,212 --> 00:37:50,884
Oh, wrong impulse.
You'll get slaughtered.

732
00:37:51,052 --> 00:37:54,716
You had better file this right
away to avoid a summary judgment.

733
00:37:54,931 --> 00:37:58,183
Mark, the hospital's board of
directors is gonna be very relieved...

734
00:37:58,395 --> 00:38:01,066
...to hear that you have
such excellent representation.

735
00:38:01,274 --> 00:38:05,523
You know, you came about
this close to losing your job.

736
00:38:06,116 --> 00:38:09,901
Herb, if you have any questions
at all, please just give me a call.

737
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,110
I shall. I shall.

738
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:14,045
- Take care of yourself, Alan.
- You too. Mark.

739
00:38:15,796 --> 00:38:18,504
Why did you let Alan believe
that you're representing me?

740
00:38:18,718 --> 00:38:22,669
Honestly, doc, he's a lousy lawyer.
He jumps to conclusions.

741
00:38:22,891 --> 00:38:25,265
Nevertheless, I could represent you.

742
00:38:25,438 --> 00:38:27,764
Your fee would be a little
too steep for me.

743
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:30,693
400 an hour with
$10,000 retainer fee.

744
00:38:30,903 --> 00:38:34,110
- I figured.
- But, honestly, I don't need the money.

745
00:38:34,577 --> 00:38:35,609
I'm bored.

746
00:38:35,787 --> 00:38:37,530
I'm looking for new challenges.

747
00:38:37,747 --> 00:38:39,077
Here's the deal.

748
00:38:39,292 --> 00:38:40,324
Let me shadow you.

749
00:38:40,837 --> 00:38:42,829
You throw in a few procedures.
Nothing big.

750
00:38:43,047 --> 00:38:45,421
Maybe a couple of stitches
here and there.

751
00:38:45,635 --> 00:38:50,465
And I'll make your little lawsuit
vanish just like that. Gratis.

752
00:38:56,111 --> 00:38:58,399
I got an autopsy consent
on the Price boy.

753
00:38:58,614 --> 00:39:00,939
The father just needed more time.

754
00:39:01,535 --> 00:39:03,280
Why didn't Rocket send you?

755
00:39:03,496 --> 00:39:04,610
I refused.

756
00:39:04,831 --> 00:39:06,028
That was a ballsy move.

757
00:39:06,251 --> 00:39:08,291
It wasn't a move.
I told him what I felt.

758
00:39:08,503 --> 00:39:11,506
Well, it worked. Take a look
at tomorrow's surgery schedule.

759
00:39:11,717 --> 00:39:15,220
You're scrubbing in on a lap
splenectomy at 7 a. m.

760
00:39:15,765 --> 00:39:17,223
Rocket's team.

761
00:39:17,433 --> 00:39:19,973
He's partial to residents
with backbone.

762
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,311
John?

763
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,074
Yes, Henry?

764
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:30,403
What happened?

765
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:33,701
You went into anaphylactic shock
from latex.

766
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:35,954
I was near death.

767
00:39:36,172 --> 00:39:38,877
- Yes.
- And you were there.

768
00:39:39,093 --> 00:39:40,802
Yes, Henry. I was there.

769
00:39:41,221 --> 00:39:43,214
And so was Anna.

770
00:39:45,812 --> 00:39:48,054
It was like a dream.

771
00:39:48,564 --> 00:39:49,894
Anna!

772
00:39:50,903 --> 00:39:52,564
Hey, Henry.

773
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:56,869
It was the most amazing thing.

774
00:39:58,413 --> 00:40:01,832
I remember being drawn...

775
00:40:02,044 --> 00:40:04,965
...toward this bright light.

776
00:40:05,175 --> 00:40:08,260
And then suddenly I was floating...

777
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:10,839
...up above you...

778
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:15,141
...over there in the corner...

779
00:40:17,988 --> 00:40:21,653
...watching as the two of you...

780
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:26,488
...enveloped in a blue glow...

781
00:40:27,626 --> 00:40:31,793
...worked together, united...

782
00:40:33,094 --> 00:40:35,086
...to save my life.

783
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,434
Thank you, John.

784
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,847
Thank you, Anna.

785
00:40:44,152 --> 00:40:46,111
You are my angels.

786
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,524
You brought me back to the living.

787
00:40:57,673 --> 00:40:58,834
Good night.

788
00:40:59,175 --> 00:41:00,290
Good night.

789
00:41:00,802 --> 00:41:02,842
Can't be a chart you're writing.

790
00:41:03,305 --> 00:41:04,338
No.

791
00:41:04,517 --> 00:41:06,761
And from the way
you're covering it up...

792
00:41:06,978 --> 00:41:08,723
...I'd say it's something personal.

793
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,849
Yeah. It's a...

794
00:41:11,526 --> 00:41:12,559
It's a love letter.

795
00:41:14,781 --> 00:41:17,489
The sentimental kind...

796
00:41:17,704 --> 00:41:20,410
...or the "I'd like to
rip your pants off" kind?

797
00:41:22,002 --> 00:41:23,377
Definitely the latter.

798
00:41:24,632 --> 00:41:26,755
I'd like to be writing one of those.

799
00:41:26,926 --> 00:41:28,255
Pity I broke up with Jeremy.

800
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:32,262
- Could've been more fun, long-distance.
- Someone from home?

801
00:41:32,518 --> 00:41:34,762
A self-possessed dermatologist.

802
00:41:35,106 --> 00:41:37,264
I'm afraid I broke his heart.

803
00:41:38,277 --> 00:41:39,688
Well, it's 9:00.

804
00:41:39,904 --> 00:41:43,109
And since you're writing rather
than living out your prose...

805
00:41:43,326 --> 00:41:46,911
- ... I'd venture to say you're alone.
- Yeah.

806
00:41:48,166 --> 00:41:49,449
Fancy grabbing a drink?

807
00:41:50,713 --> 00:41:52,171
I would love to.

808
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:57,712
It is an unenviable job
running the ER...

809
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:00,347
...and making difficult
cost-cutting decisions.

810
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,550
I got your message.

811
00:42:02,063 --> 00:42:06,195
Jeanie came in quite upset
about the budget.

812
00:42:06,405 --> 00:42:08,561
And I was just explaining that...

813
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:11,571
...it appears that you treated her
honestly and fairly.

814
00:42:11,787 --> 00:42:14,076
She gave herself a $25,000 raise.

815
00:42:14,248 --> 00:42:16,125
That's from the administrative budget.

816
00:42:16,337 --> 00:42:19,337
I understand that's your story.
But I don't buy it.

817
00:42:19,548 --> 00:42:20,924
Something else is going on.

818
00:42:22,595 --> 00:42:23,841
And what would that be?

819
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,754
My HIV status.

820
00:42:25,974 --> 00:42:27,057
Jeanie!

821
00:42:27,685 --> 00:42:29,514
I believe that's why I'm being fired.

822
00:42:33,654 --> 00:42:34,684
I see.

823
00:42:36,783 --> 00:42:37,982
Well...

824
00:42:38,952 --> 00:42:40,330
Let's not do anything rash.

825
00:42:41,666 --> 00:42:44,290
I am late for a dinner at the moment.

826
00:42:44,463 --> 00:42:47,464
But tomorrow I can give the budget...

827
00:42:47,675 --> 00:42:49,469
...another more thorough review.

828
00:42:49,638 --> 00:42:51,713
We've been over these figures
a dozen times.

829
00:42:51,931 --> 00:42:53,890
You told me we had to cut P.A.s.

830
00:42:55,312 --> 00:42:58,814
Why don't you give Kerry and me
another day to recheck our figures?

831
00:42:58,984 --> 00:43:01,192
Thank you, Dr. Anspaugh. I will.

832
00:43:07,998 --> 00:43:11,835
Jeanie, you're really gonna use
your HIV status like this?

833
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:13,458
I call it as I see it.

834
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,466
I tried everything to keep you here.

835
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:18,514
Then I bent over backwards
to help you get a job in Atlanta.

836
00:43:18,724 --> 00:43:20,348
It just isn't fair, is it?

837
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,681
I've never discriminated against
you because of your HIV status.

838
00:43:23,897 --> 00:43:25,644
I fought to keep you here.

839
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:28,529
Kerry, like you said before,
it's nothing personal.

840
00:43:32,703 --> 00:43:37,782
- To your health!
- Thank you.

841
00:43:51,689 --> 00:43:52,724
Here.

842
00:43:52,943 --> 00:43:55,814
- What have we here?
- What have we here?

843
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:57,775
Another present?

844
00:43:58,868 --> 00:44:02,155
It's beautiful. Should I try it on?

845
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:04,202
You can try it on later.

846
00:44:10,928 --> 00:44:14,882
I dream of the taste of your neck and
the smell of your hair on my pillow.

847
00:44:15,103 --> 00:44:16,301
You do?

848
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,605
No, silly. You do.

849
00:44:19,776 --> 00:44:21,816
Did you mean everything
you wrote?

850
00:44:22,028 --> 00:44:24,438
Yeah. Yeah, I did. It was...

851
00:44:24,617 --> 00:44:26,242
I was homesick.

852
00:44:29,624 --> 00:44:32,960
Do you remember this afternoon
when I said that I will?

853
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:34,714
I changed my mind. I won't.

854
00:44:34,924 --> 00:44:36,040
You won't?

855
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:41,802
Not unless you go first. Lie back.
