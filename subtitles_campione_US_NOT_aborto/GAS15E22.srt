00:00:03,692 --> 00:00:06,996
<i>On average, our heart beats
70 times per minute.</i>

2
00:00:15,729 --> 00:00:17,807
<i>In the same 60-second period,</i>

3
00:00:17,831 --> 00:00:20,543
<i>we blink between 10 and 15 times,</i>

4
00:00:20,567 --> 00:00:21,811
<i>swallow once,</i>

5
00:00:21,835 --> 00:00:23,546
<i>and take up to 20 breaths.</i>

6
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:26,516
Okay, you can't fall asleep here.

7
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,017
The kids.

8
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:29,552
You have to go, please.

9
00:00:29,576 --> 00:00:31,354
Right.

10
00:00:31,378 --> 00:00:32,689
Go, go, go. Come on.

11
00:00:32,713 --> 00:00:33,723
- Okay.
- Please.

12
00:00:33,747 --> 00:00:35,225
I'm up.

13
00:00:38,852 --> 00:00:40,029
What are you lookin' at?

14
00:00:47,127 --> 00:00:49,506
- Bye.
- Bye.

15
00:00:52,434 --> 00:00:53,543
Bye.

16
00:00:53,567 --> 00:00:54,944
Tip-toe.

17
00:00:54,968 --> 00:00:56,546
Don't forget to tip-toe.

18
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:57,680
Quiet as a mouse.

19
00:00:57,704 --> 00:00:59,382
<i>Our hearts beat...</i>

20
00:01:00,774 --> 00:01:02,552
<i>...our lungs breathe,</i>

21
00:01:02,576 --> 00:01:04,854
<i>our bodies keep us alive...</i>

22
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,024
<i>...and most of us barely notice.</i>

23
00:01:09,983 --> 00:01:13,430
Oh, hey... Zola.

24
00:01:13,454 --> 00:01:14,697
Uh...

25
00:01:16,557 --> 00:01:17,934
<i>We just take it all for granted.</i>

26
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:18,968
Um...

28
00:01:28,802 --> 00:01:30,113
What did she say?

29
00:01:30,137 --> 00:01:31,696
- Did she ask you what you're doing here?
- No.

30
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,749
What is she doing up?

31
00:01:32,773 --> 00:01:34,288
I-I-I don't know.
She was thirsty, I guess.

32
00:01:34,312 --> 00:01:37,086
I mean, my kids know you as
the sad guy from the couch.

33
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,389
An embarrassing chapter in my life, yes.

34
00:01:39,413 --> 00:01:41,491
Have I apologized for that
recently? I'd like to.

35
00:01:41,515 --> 00:01:44,093
I mean, I had a whole plan
for telling my kids about us

36
00:01:44,117 --> 00:01:46,162
with ice cream, and they could
talk about their feelings,

37
00:01:46,186 --> 00:01:47,730
and now it's just blown.

38
00:01:48,956 --> 00:01:50,567
What? Why are you smiling?

39
00:01:50,591 --> 00:01:52,602
You were planning on
telling your kids about us?

40
00:01:53,694 --> 00:01:54,704
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

41
00:01:54,728 --> 00:01:56,639
- Um, what can I do?
- Don't be sorry.

42
00:01:56,663 --> 00:01:59,275
You can just go. Quietly.

43
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:00,343
- Bye.
- Bye.

44
00:02:00,367 --> 00:02:01,377
Wait, wait, wait, let me check,

45
00:02:01,401 --> 00:02:02,645
make sure the coast is clear.

46
00:02:10,277 --> 00:02:12,155
Okay, coast is clear.

47
00:02:12,179 --> 00:02:13,508
Okay.

48
00:02:14,014 --> 00:02:16,426
- Bye.
- Bye.

49
00:02:23,624 --> 00:02:25,285
Yes, yes, yes, Megan,

50
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,537
I'm gonna be there. I said
I'm gonna be there, so...

51
00:02:27,561 --> 00:02:28,705
What do you mean I might throw up?

52
00:02:28,729 --> 00:02:30,540
What kind of therapy is this?

53
00:02:30,564 --> 00:02:32,609
Okay, yes. Yes, yes, yes.

54
00:02:32,633 --> 00:02:34,110
It's okay. It's okay.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

55
00:02:34,134 --> 00:02:35,216
Listen, listen.

56
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,446
Oh!

57
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,614
Lis...

58
00:02:37,638 --> 00:02:38,648
I'm gonna be there, okay?

59
00:02:38,672 --> 00:02:40,550
Just... I-I'll call you later.

60
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:43,520
No. No.

61
00:02:43,544 --> 00:02:46,689
I never told him to call Ben "Dad."

62
00:02:46,713 --> 00:02:50,293
T... Y-Yes, I'm aware
that you are Tuck's father.

63
00:02:50,317 --> 00:02:52,695
And please do not raise
your voice at me...

64
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:54,731
Hello? Tucker?

65
00:02:55,428 --> 00:02:57,000
M...

66
00:02:58,358 --> 00:03:02,672
My ex-husband overheard
our son call Ben "Dad."

67
00:03:02,696 --> 00:03:05,642
And now Tucker's hurt, Tuck feels bad,

68
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,176
and Ben is oblivious... Thanks...

69
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,245
and, somehow, it's all <i>my</i> problem.

70
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:11,548
Are you asking my opinion
about all of this?

71
00:03:11,572 --> 00:03:14,350
I would way rather give
my opinion about <i>your</i> life.

72
00:03:14,374 --> 00:03:16,419
Hmm. In that case,

73
00:03:16,443 --> 00:03:18,655
how did you tell Tuck when
you started dating Ben?

74
00:03:18,679 --> 00:03:20,523
Is this about you and DeLuca?

75
00:03:20,547 --> 00:03:22,592
Oh, I see everything, Grey.

76
00:03:22,616 --> 00:03:23,826
I am the chief.

77
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,901
Uh-huh. He told you.

78
00:03:25,925 --> 00:03:27,430
Who? Richard?

79
00:03:27,454 --> 00:03:28,565
Well, the man's very chatty.

80
00:03:30,223 --> 00:03:33,336
So, Zola actually saw him
last night at the house

81
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,004
before I had a chance
to talk to her, so it was...

82
00:03:35,028 --> 00:03:36,372
She's back.

83
00:03:36,396 --> 00:03:37,542
- Oh.
- What?

84
00:03:37,566 --> 00:03:38,942
Jo's back. She's here.

85
00:03:38,966 --> 00:03:41,058
Oh, and here, I thought
she might be dead, or...

86
00:03:41,105 --> 00:03:43,079
Don't do that. Don't give a speech about
how you thought she was dead

87
00:03:43,103 --> 00:03:45,381
or lost a limb or left me
or whatever, all right?

88
00:03:45,405 --> 00:03:46,716
She's not okay, and I don't know why.

89
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,452
Just don't be Bailey about it, please.

90
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,718
Dr. Karev.

91
00:03:57,084 --> 00:03:58,528
Welcome back.

92
00:03:59,786 --> 00:04:01,531
I'll be in the lab.

93
00:04:06,727 --> 00:04:10,440
That was way worse than if
you had been Bailey about it.

94
00:04:10,464 --> 00:04:13,142
Mnh. Mm-hmm.

95
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:14,777
<i>Dr. Bashine to the OR.</i>

96
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:15,828
<i>Dr. Linda Bashine to the OR.</i>

97
00:04:15,852 --> 00:04:17,280
Is it ready?

98
00:04:17,304 --> 00:04:18,481
It's ready.

99
00:04:18,505 --> 00:04:20,483
- So, it's happening?
- It's happening.

100
00:04:20,507 --> 00:04:21,884
Can we tell them?

101
00:04:21,908 --> 00:04:23,820
W-We can tell them, but try to
contain your wagging tail

102
00:04:23,844 --> 00:04:25,555
because this could be nothing
and could do nothing.

103
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:27,824
We don't want to bait them
with false hope. It's cruel.

104
00:04:27,848 --> 00:04:29,592
Right. Just hang on.

105
00:04:29,616 --> 00:04:30,727
What?

106
00:04:30,751 --> 00:04:33,162
I need to wag my tail
for a second out here.

107
00:04:33,186 --> 00:04:34,831
Man, I hope this is not nothing.

108
00:04:34,855 --> 00:04:36,733
Me, too.

109
00:04:39,292 --> 00:04:41,671
So, wait, you're saying my mom might
be able to use her arms again?

110
00:04:41,695 --> 00:04:43,406
We're saying there's a clinical trial

111
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,808
with stem cells being directly
injected into the cervical spine.

112
00:04:45,832 --> 00:04:47,510
That's turning quadriplegics
into paraplegics.

113
00:04:47,534 --> 00:04:48,845
That's... That's what you said.

114
00:04:48,869 --> 00:04:50,647
In some cases, yes.

115
00:04:50,671 --> 00:04:52,115
We just need your approval,

116
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:54,817
and then we can get started as
soon as the stem cells arrive.

117
00:04:54,841 --> 00:04:56,419
Mom?

118
00:04:56,443 --> 00:04:58,692
Yes. Yes, please.

119
00:05:02,683 --> 00:05:03,760
Are you nervous?

120
00:05:03,784 --> 00:05:05,828
I throw up before every job interview.

121
00:05:05,852 --> 00:05:06,940
I just ace them.

122
00:05:06,964 --> 00:05:09,666
So arrogant. I love it.

123
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,167
But why San Francisco?

124
00:05:11,191 --> 00:05:13,569
My fellowship year is almost up.

125
00:05:13,593 --> 00:05:15,529
- I have to interview at places
- No, I'm saying there's a lot of

126
00:05:15,554 --> 00:05:17,173
- before I...
- excellent jobs right here.

127
00:05:17,197 --> 00:05:20,777
And I hear the weather is worse in
San Francisco than it is in Seattle,

128
00:05:20,801 --> 00:05:21,978
and the rent is triple.

129
00:05:22,002 --> 00:05:24,670
And... hills.

130
00:05:27,207 --> 00:05:29,709
You're on my vertebroplasty today, right?

131
00:05:31,144 --> 00:05:32,555
I'll see you there.

132
00:05:33,814 --> 00:05:35,558
And the sports teams!

133
00:05:35,582 --> 00:05:37,193
Seattle has better sports teams!

134
00:05:37,217 --> 00:05:38,294
I'm guessing.

135
00:05:39,553 --> 00:05:40,830
It's a bowel obstruction.

136
00:05:40,854 --> 00:05:42,365
I know the symptoms. I have IBD.

137
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:44,133
I've had three obstructions
and three surgeries.

138
00:05:44,157 --> 00:05:45,468
All right, what are your symptoms?

139
00:05:45,492 --> 00:05:48,304
Pain, bloating, cramping...
bowel obstruction symptoms.

140
00:05:48,328 --> 00:05:49,439
Ow!

141
00:05:49,463 --> 00:05:50,873
Okay, I'd love to take your word for it,

142
00:05:50,897 --> 00:05:53,376
- but I have to get you a...
- Get a CT. Yeah, I know.

143
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,644
Can you just order it, please?

144
00:05:54,668 --> 00:05:55,645
It really hurts.

145
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:57,007
Okay.

146
00:05:57,771 --> 00:05:58,848
Dr. DeLuca?

147
00:05:58,872 --> 00:06:00,316
Yeah?

148
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:06,275
Uh, I have a patient who's...

149
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:08,558
- Are you a doctor?
- Uh, I am, yes,

150
00:06:08,582 --> 00:06:10,159
but I'm gonna need you to
check in with her first, okay?

151
00:06:10,183 --> 00:06:14,897
I-I just had a little trouble
puttin' on my shoes.

152
00:06:14,921 --> 00:06:16,655
- Oh. Oh.
- Oh.

153
00:06:18,725 --> 00:06:20,336
Yeah, maybe you should help her first.

154
00:06:26,695 --> 00:06:29,014
I see a small pericardial effusion.

155
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,552
The shoes were new.

156
00:06:30,576 --> 00:06:31,887
I went dancing.

157
00:06:31,911 --> 00:06:36,425
A little underground club
I was supposedly too old for.

158
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:38,673
Had a few shots too many.

159
00:06:39,652 --> 00:06:42,931
And I took off my shoes to walk
up the stairs to my apartment,

160
00:06:42,955 --> 00:06:45,367
and... that's all I remember.

161
00:06:45,391 --> 00:06:46,802
You slept like this?

162
00:06:46,826 --> 00:06:48,070
Oh, crap.

163
00:06:48,094 --> 00:06:49,371
Gemma?

164
00:06:49,395 --> 00:06:51,206
- Uh, excuse me.
- You two know each other?

165
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:53,104
Um...

166
00:06:53,966 --> 00:06:56,912
Through, um, a mutual friend.

167
00:06:56,936 --> 00:06:59,114
Well, Ollie isn't around anymore,

168
00:06:59,138 --> 00:07:01,049
so thank you for your concern,

169
00:07:01,073 --> 00:07:04,119
but, as you can see,
I'm... I'm all set here.

170
00:07:04,143 --> 00:07:05,888
Gemma, how did this happen?

171
00:07:05,912 --> 00:07:08,390
I think you and I both know
how this happened.

172
00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:16,765
Josh Sterman, 21,
has hereditary osteoporosis

173
00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:18,167
that caused a compression fracture

174
00:07:18,191 --> 00:07:20,002
at T-11 to T-12,

175
00:07:20,026 --> 00:07:22,471
scheduled for
a percutaneous vertebroplasty.

176
00:07:22,495 --> 00:07:25,307
I'll inject cement right here
into the vertebral body

177
00:07:25,331 --> 00:07:27,009
to restore its integrity,

178
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:28,177
then you'll be good to go.

179
00:07:28,201 --> 00:07:29,178
You'll be out of here in time for dinner.

180
00:07:29,202 --> 00:07:30,479
Pop-Pop?

181
00:07:30,503 --> 00:07:32,181
Dr. Bailey!

182
00:07:34,674 --> 00:07:36,118
Josh, you remember Dr. Bailey?

183
00:07:36,142 --> 00:07:38,754
She's the one who takes out part
of my bowel every few years.

184
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:41,523
Uh, recurrent diverticulitis.

185
00:07:41,547 --> 00:07:43,091
Now, the last time I saw you,

186
00:07:43,115 --> 00:07:46,128
you were, what, a foot shorter
and studying for the SATs.

187
00:07:46,152 --> 00:07:47,176
He aced 'em!

188
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,330
- Aww.
- And thanks to you,

189
00:07:48,354 --> 00:07:51,099
I saw him graduate from
high school and get into Udub.

190
00:07:51,123 --> 00:07:52,768
Next stop, business school.

191
00:07:52,792 --> 00:07:54,536
I can't finish those applications

192
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,104
until my back stops hurting.

193
00:07:56,128 --> 00:07:59,174
- He's getting a vertebroplasty today.
- Oh.

194
00:07:59,198 --> 00:08:01,176
Did I say that right?

195
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,212
I thought we'd be seeing Dr. Lincoln,

196
00:08:03,236 --> 00:08:04,680
the fancy sports guy?

197
00:08:04,704 --> 00:08:07,382
Oh, well, Dr. Kim is
Dr. Lincoln's fellow.

198
00:08:07,406 --> 00:08:10,219
He's being wooed by the top hospitals

199
00:08:10,243 --> 00:08:12,020
and some pro-sports teams.

200
00:08:12,044 --> 00:08:13,889
You're lucky you've got him
while he's still here.

201
00:08:13,913 --> 00:08:15,190
Thank you, Chief Bailey.

202
00:08:15,214 --> 00:08:17,559
So, I will, uh, check back
a little later.

203
00:08:18,818 --> 00:08:20,252
Pressure's on, man.

204
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,488
Wow.

205
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,306
Which one is that one?

206
00:08:30,396 --> 00:08:32,140
The Arc de Triomphe.

207
00:08:32,164 --> 00:08:33,876
From Paris?

208
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:37,813
The golden plate represents
the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

209
00:08:37,837 --> 00:08:39,738
Hm. It's cool.

210
00:08:41,774 --> 00:08:43,552
Be back in a second.

211
00:08:43,576 --> 00:08:45,721
<i>Dr. Ruta, please contact the lab.</i>

212
00:08:45,745 --> 00:08:47,389
<i>Dr. Ruta, please contact the lab.</i>

213
00:08:47,413 --> 00:08:49,491
Any word from
the rare blood organizations?

214
00:08:49,515 --> 00:08:51,159
Well, I'm waiting on
that call from Amsterdam.

215
00:08:51,183 --> 00:08:53,328
He's getting weaker. I need that blood.

216
00:08:53,352 --> 00:08:55,664
I've called Cristina.
I even called Marie Cerone.

217
00:08:55,688 --> 00:08:56,832
Thanks.

218
00:08:59,191 --> 00:09:00,814
What about Jo?

219
00:09:00,838 --> 00:09:02,789
She said anything yet?

220
00:09:02,813 --> 00:09:04,172
Not at all?

221
00:09:04,196 --> 00:09:05,540
It's happening again.

222
00:09:05,564 --> 00:09:07,409
- It's not.
- No, they're happy for a while...

223
00:09:07,433 --> 00:09:09,111
- It's not happening.
- ...then they break...

224
00:09:09,135 --> 00:09:11,446
- She's not broken.
- ...and then they leave me.

225
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,581
Listen to me.

226
00:09:12,605 --> 00:09:13,782
You have to trust her.

227
00:09:13,806 --> 00:09:15,050
She isn't Izzie.

228
00:09:15,074 --> 00:09:16,351
She isn't Ava or Lexie.

229
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,053
She isn't your mother.

230
00:09:18,077 --> 00:09:20,188
And she's not broken,
and neither are you.

231
00:09:20,212 --> 00:09:22,190
She's going through something.

232
00:09:22,214 --> 00:09:25,294
And she's been through worse and
come out on the other side fine.

233
00:09:25,318 --> 00:09:27,296
She's just not ready
to talk about it yet.

234
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,087
I've been there.

235
00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:31,233
You give <i>me</i> space. You give <i>me</i> time.

236
00:09:31,257 --> 00:09:32,801
Right?

237
00:09:32,825 --> 00:09:34,069
Okay.

238
00:09:34,093 --> 00:09:36,103
It's not happening again.

239
00:09:49,642 --> 00:09:50,990
Wow.

240
00:09:51,777 --> 00:09:53,588
That's a lot of journals.

241
00:09:53,612 --> 00:09:55,490
Oh, you got binders, too. Great.

242
00:09:55,514 --> 00:09:59,294
Yeah, this is the lab where boring
things go to get more boring.

243
00:09:59,318 --> 00:10:01,897
Bailey's really piling it on now
that she's chief again, huh?

244
00:10:01,921 --> 00:10:03,962
Yeah, didn't help that
I was out for a while.

245
00:10:05,257 --> 00:10:06,535
Mm-hmm.

246
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:08,770
Okay, well, I don't want to
bother you, then.

247
00:10:08,794 --> 00:10:09,938
Bother me how?

248
00:10:09,962 --> 00:10:11,173
Oh, nothing.

249
00:10:11,197 --> 00:10:12,574
I just thought maybe you could help me

250
00:10:12,598 --> 00:10:13,909
with my spray-on skin research,

251
00:10:13,933 --> 00:10:17,112
but you seem pretty underwater, so...

252
00:10:17,136 --> 00:10:18,246
Wait.

253
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:21,083
That sounds way better than any of this.

254
00:10:21,107 --> 00:10:23,251
Then again, so does a root canal.

255
00:10:23,275 --> 00:10:26,188
Well, that's just the winning
attitude I'm looking for.

256
00:10:27,813 --> 00:10:30,258
- So, you're a <i>licensed</i> therapist?
- I am.

257
00:10:30,282 --> 00:10:32,194
'Cause I don't believe in, you know...

258
00:10:32,218 --> 00:10:34,763
alternative... whatever...

259
00:10:34,787 --> 00:10:38,333
You know, holistic... voodoo stuff.

260
00:10:38,357 --> 00:10:40,369
No voodoo. Got it.

261
00:10:42,228 --> 00:10:44,506
Well, Megan swears by this...

262
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,274
whatever this thing is
that you're doing, so...

263
00:10:46,298 --> 00:10:47,776
Neuro Emotional Technique.

264
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,011
Mm.

265
00:10:49,035 --> 00:10:50,812
It's a psycho-therapeutic modality

266
00:10:50,836 --> 00:10:52,314
in which I use muscle testing

267
00:10:52,338 --> 00:10:53,715
to determine where in your body

268
00:10:53,739 --> 00:10:56,218
you might be holding on to
unresolved patterns of stress,

269
00:10:56,242 --> 00:10:58,387
- like trauma, physical injury... Hmm.
- Muscle testing.

270
00:10:58,411 --> 00:11:01,523
Is that like when you, uh,
get weak when you're lying?

271
00:11:01,547 --> 00:11:03,658
Because that... that is
a party trick, not science.

272
00:11:03,682 --> 00:11:04,960
You're right.

273
00:11:04,984 --> 00:11:07,396
It's not the most precise
system of diagnosis,

274
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,365
but, often, when your mind is
trying to hide something from you,

275
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:12,901
your body will still
throw you under the bus.

276
00:11:12,925 --> 00:11:15,237
Well...

277
00:11:15,261 --> 00:11:17,785
This helped Megan with her trauma, so...

278
00:11:18,397 --> 00:11:20,709
And she was held hostage in Iraq.

279
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:22,911
For a decade. Presumed dead.

280
00:11:22,935 --> 00:11:27,516
So I figured, if it helped her,
then what the hell?

281
00:11:30,776 --> 00:11:32,551
Megan is convinced that I am incapable

282
00:11:32,576 --> 00:11:34,256
of allowing joy to exist in my life

283
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,791
due to some unprocessed trauma

284
00:11:35,815 --> 00:11:38,890
that your weird voodoo therapy is
supposed to help me with, so...

285
00:11:40,419 --> 00:11:41,768
Do you think she's right?

286
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,334
Ow!

287
00:11:46,358 --> 00:11:48,270
This is worse than it's ever been.

288
00:11:48,294 --> 00:11:49,838
I-I know it's hard, Avi,

289
00:11:49,862 --> 00:11:51,406
but I'm gonna need you to hold
still for another little while.

290
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,778
<i>Okay? You're doing great.</i>

291
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,154
- Hey, you paged?
- Hey.

292
00:11:56,178 --> 00:11:59,081
Uh, yes, I have a
24-year-old patient with IBD.

293
00:11:59,105 --> 00:12:01,116
She presents with severe abdominal pain.

294
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,784
She thinks it's an obstruction,

295
00:12:02,808 --> 00:12:04,252
but, I mean, she's in way too much pain.

296
00:12:04,276 --> 00:12:05,881
- I-I think it might be a perf.
- Ow.

297
00:12:05,906 --> 00:12:07,081
- Yeah.
- Okay.

298
00:12:07,106 --> 00:12:08,723
I'm... I'm waiting for the
images to come up, so...

299
00:12:08,747 --> 00:12:09,758
Okay.

300
00:12:09,782 --> 00:12:11,860
How was, uh, Zola this morning?

301
00:12:11,884 --> 00:12:14,429
She freaked out? Traumatized?

302
00:12:14,453 --> 00:12:16,364
I mean, I don't think so, actually.

303
00:12:16,388 --> 00:12:18,733
I think she was kind of normal-ish.

304
00:12:18,757 --> 00:12:21,236
I mean, it's hard to hear her
over my own tell-tale heart.

305
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,437
Right?

306
00:12:22,461 --> 00:12:23,705
I mean, why... why do we feel so guilty?

307
00:12:23,729 --> 00:12:25,373
We're not doing anything wrong, right?

308
00:12:25,397 --> 00:12:26,604
Well...

309
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:28,810
Do you even like kids?

310
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:29,945
What?

311
00:12:29,969 --> 00:12:31,480
Well, we really haven't talked about it,

312
00:12:31,504 --> 00:12:33,569
and I do have three of them.

313
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,619
I have 16 first cousins, age 2 to 15.

314
00:12:37,643 --> 00:12:40,455
The 14-year-old, Tony,
always calls me about girls.

315
00:12:40,479 --> 00:12:42,324
He's been doing that since he was 9.

316
00:12:42,348 --> 00:12:44,426
The 5-year-old, Sonia,

317
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,394
she attaches herself to my leg
when she sees me,

318
00:12:46,418 --> 00:12:48,306
and I basically wear
her like a leg brace.

319
00:12:49,385 --> 00:12:50,932
The 2-year-old, Nicholas,

320
00:12:50,956 --> 00:12:52,667
likes to put things in my hair
and then dig them out.

321
00:12:55,261 --> 00:12:57,439
Your problem's not gonna be
that I don't like kids, Mer.

322
00:12:57,463 --> 00:13:00,509
Your problem's gonna be that your
kids might like me more than you.

323
00:13:00,533 --> 00:13:01,495
- You think?
- Mm-hmm.

324
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,474
- Oh.
- Scans are up.

325
00:13:04,003 --> 00:13:05,180
Okay, Avi, your scans are up.

326
00:13:05,204 --> 00:13:06,181
We're almost done here.

327
00:13:06,205 --> 00:13:08,250
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

328
00:13:08,274 --> 00:13:09,885
<i>You didn't run a pregnancy test?!</i>

329
00:13:09,909 --> 00:13:12,487
<i>No, no, no, Qadri said she ran
standard labs and then a CT.</i>

330
00:13:12,511 --> 00:13:13,516
<i>What... Oh, my God.</i>

331
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,589
You guys, I'm not pregnant.

332
00:13:14,613 --> 00:13:16,529
I just have... Oww!

333
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:20,362
Avi, you are pregnant,
and you are in labor,

334
00:13:20,386 --> 00:13:21,696
<i>and it looks like you're crowning.</i>

335
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,698
- What?
- What?

336
00:13:23,722 --> 00:13:26,134
- Let's page OB and page the chief.
- Yep.

337
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:32,988
Uh, Dr. Pierce, can you excuse us?

338
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:35,168
I-I'd like a few minutes alone
with Gemma if there's time.

339
00:13:35,193 --> 00:13:36,333
- Of course.
- No.

340
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,251
- Gemma.
- No, I don't want him in here.

341
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:39,268
Dr. Webber...

342
00:13:39,292 --> 00:13:40,454
Gemma, don't be ridiculous.

343
00:13:40,478 --> 00:13:42,723
- You are not my doctor.
- No, I'm your friend.

344
00:13:42,747 --> 00:13:44,558
And I owe it to Ollie to check on you.

345
00:13:44,582 --> 00:13:46,460
Ollie is dead.

346
00:13:46,484 --> 00:13:49,463
I don't want you in here
preaching at me, praying at me,

347
00:13:49,487 --> 00:13:51,465
- pretending you relate.
- Except I do.

348
00:13:51,489 --> 00:13:53,816
No, you don't. You got a wife.

349
00:13:54,492 --> 00:13:55,769
You got kids.

350
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,238
I had a sponsor. I had Ollie.

351
00:13:58,262 --> 00:14:00,748
And now I got a stiletto in my chest

352
00:14:00,749 --> 00:14:03,195
and a bottle of tequila
waiting for me when I get home.

353
00:14:03,219 --> 00:14:06,464
And I don't want to hear what you
got to think about any of it.

354
00:14:06,488 --> 00:14:08,900
So get out of my room
before I call security.

355
00:14:08,924 --> 00:14:10,202
Oh, for God's sakes, Gemma.

356
00:14:10,226 --> 00:14:11,542
Get out.

357
00:14:12,761 --> 00:14:15,273
Um, you better run a tox screen,

358
00:14:15,297 --> 00:14:16,708
make sure she's not still drunk.

359
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:18,726
You arrogant son of a bitch!

360
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,412
Get out! Get out!

361
00:14:20,436 --> 00:14:22,047
- Gemma, please calm down.
- Get out!

362
00:14:22,071 --> 00:14:23,615
- Please... Gemma, please hold still.
- Get out!

363
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:25,483
- Get out!
- Dr. Webber, get out! Please.

364
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:31,690
Did you page OB?

365
00:14:31,714 --> 00:14:32,958
<i>Yeah, it's a busy
delivery day, apparently.</i>

366
00:14:32,982 --> 00:14:35,126
Oww!

367
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,428
Okay, Avi, good, push!

368
00:14:36,452 --> 00:14:38,463
<i>How do you give a pregnant woman a CT?</i>

369
00:14:38,487 --> 00:14:40,065
Qadri ordered the CT.

370
00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:41,600
'Cause I had my period yesterday.

371
00:14:41,624 --> 00:14:43,435
This makes no seeeense!

372
00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:45,136
Bear down, Avi. Good job.

373
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,137
Oh!

374
00:14:46,161 --> 00:14:47,505
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

375
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:49,074
Two wombs!

376
00:14:49,098 --> 00:14:50,342
- What?
- <i>Ah!</i>

377
00:14:50,366 --> 00:14:51,343
<i>Oh, look at this!</i>

378
00:14:51,367 --> 00:14:53,812
It's a u-uterus didelphys!

379
00:14:53,836 --> 00:14:55,080
<i>Look at this, Grey!</i>

380
00:14:55,104 --> 00:14:56,948
I'm a little busy right now, Dr. Bailey!

381
00:14:56,972 --> 00:14:58,917
What the hell is uter... Aaah!

382
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:01,620
<i>You have two uteri, but
you're only pregnant in one!</i>

383
00:15:01,644 --> 00:15:03,989
<i>Oh, my Goooood!</i>

384
00:15:04,013 --> 00:15:06,358
Good job, good job, Avi.

385
00:15:06,382 --> 00:15:07,492
You're almost there.

386
00:15:07,516 --> 00:15:08,683
Head down, okay? Come on.

387
00:15:09,852 --> 00:15:12,297
<i>Okay.</i>

388
00:15:12,321 --> 00:15:13,531
Okay.

389
00:15:13,555 --> 00:15:17,602
Here's your baby boy.

390
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,285
So, did you ever follow through
with the whole...

391
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:34,853
birth-mom thing?

392
00:15:34,877 --> 00:15:35,954
Have you been talking to Alex?

393
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:37,795
Not about that, no.

394
00:15:38,213 --> 00:15:41,293
- Well, you were right.
- About?

395
00:15:41,317 --> 00:15:42,527
You know what?

396
00:15:42,551 --> 00:15:43,695
Y-You said that you needed me to help you

397
00:15:43,719 --> 00:15:44,696
with spray-on skin,

398
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,830
so can we just get to it already?

399
00:15:45,854 --> 00:15:47,165
It's a process.

400
00:15:47,189 --> 00:15:50,235
Right now, we're focused on
aerosolization and coverage.

401
00:15:50,259 --> 00:15:51,636
I was wrong.

402
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,871
This is a lab

403
00:15:52,895 --> 00:15:55,307
where boring things go
to get more boring.

404
00:15:55,331 --> 00:15:57,008
Mm.

405
00:15:57,032 --> 00:15:58,608
Injecting cement.

406
00:16:05,441 --> 00:16:06,751
Is that it?

407
00:16:06,775 --> 00:16:09,187
Just because I made it look easy
doesn't mean it was.

408
00:16:14,283 --> 00:16:16,061
Do you have them?

409
00:16:16,085 --> 00:16:17,562
The... The stem cells? Are they here?

410
00:16:17,586 --> 00:16:18,897
Uh, not yet.

411
00:16:18,921 --> 00:16:20,999
Now we just have to get some
blood samples from your mom

412
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:22,233
before the procedure.

413
00:16:22,257 --> 00:16:24,369
I can't quite breathe.

414
00:16:24,393 --> 00:16:27,053
I-I mean, I can't get a deep breath.

415
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,723
And I think it's because I'm so aware.

416
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,845
I'm aware of my hands.

417
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:36,081
I'm aware of my legs.

418
00:16:36,105 --> 00:16:37,730
My fingers.

419
00:16:38,474 --> 00:16:42,354
When I walk... every step... I'm aware.

420
00:16:42,378 --> 00:16:43,455
I'm in awe.

421
00:16:43,479 --> 00:16:45,190
We're anxious and we're depressed

422
00:16:45,214 --> 00:16:48,426
and we mope and we worry
about an extra five pounds

423
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,362
or our... our stupid job.

424
00:16:50,386 --> 00:16:52,197
Since the accident, all I can think about

425
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:56,290
are my feet and my hands

426
00:16:57,659 --> 00:16:59,437
and how grateful I am for them.

427
00:17:02,664 --> 00:17:04,275
And I want them for my mom.

428
00:17:04,299 --> 00:17:07,879
I want her hands back.

429
00:17:07,903 --> 00:17:12,009
I want them so badly,
I can't quite breathe.

430
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,821
All right, we need to suspend
the patient's breathing

431
00:17:16,845 --> 00:17:19,157
for about two minutes while we inject.

432
00:17:19,181 --> 00:17:22,327
Lucky for everybody, I can do
a lot in, uh, two minutes.

433
00:17:22,351 --> 00:17:24,295
Y... What?

434
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,663
Oh.

435
00:17:25,687 --> 00:17:28,146
You miss your boyfriend.

436
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,300
Who?

437
00:17:29,324 --> 00:17:30,769
Ortho Barbie.

438
00:17:30,793 --> 00:17:34,005
Shepherd, I can't believe
you have a thing with a jock!

439
00:17:34,029 --> 00:17:35,907
It's not... Shut up.

440
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:37,976
Is it weird having sex
with a cartoon character?

441
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,178
Does he drip ink on you when he sweats?

442
00:17:40,202 --> 00:17:42,400
Okay, I made you laugh. Come on.

443
00:17:42,424 --> 00:17:44,949
Spill. I need deets, and you,
obviously... you need advice.

444
00:17:44,973 --> 00:17:46,484
Fine.

445
00:17:46,508 --> 00:17:48,420
Yes, he looks like a cartoon god,

446
00:17:48,444 --> 00:17:50,422
and the sex is athletic,

447
00:17:50,446 --> 00:17:53,625
and there is eye contact,
and nobody cries after,

448
00:17:53,649 --> 00:17:55,627
and he's funny and fun
and easy to hang out with,

449
00:17:55,651 --> 00:17:56,928
which is just confusing to me

450
00:17:56,952 --> 00:17:58,329
because it's so not my type.

451
00:17:58,353 --> 00:18:00,265
Oh! Okay.

452
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:01,499
He's your Altman. Hm.

453
00:18:01,523 --> 00:18:02,867
My Altman?

454
00:18:02,891 --> 00:18:05,470
Yeah, you know, somebody so good
and unbroken and kind

455
00:18:05,494 --> 00:18:06,805
that they just seem wrong for you,

456
00:18:06,829 --> 00:18:08,106
but, really, I mean, you...

457
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,474
You've never been happier.

458
00:18:09,498 --> 00:18:11,443
So, yeah, he's your Altman.

459
00:18:11,467 --> 00:18:13,144
Oh, Tom.

460
00:18:13,168 --> 00:18:14,368
You poor guy.

461
00:18:16,338 --> 00:18:19,517
So, you came home from Germany,
and you got back with Amelia.

462
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:20,819
But that wasn't what you wanted.

463
00:18:20,843 --> 00:18:21,820
It was.

464
00:18:21,844 --> 00:18:24,456
Amelia was... perfect.

465
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,358
I mean, if there was...
there was no Teddy, then...

466
00:18:27,382 --> 00:18:29,327
- There <i>is</i> a Teddy.
- No, there's not.

467
00:18:29,351 --> 00:18:31,062
I mean, she and I, we just...

468
00:18:31,086 --> 00:18:32,530
we have bad timing.

469
00:18:32,554 --> 00:18:33,865
But the timing was right in Germany,

470
00:18:33,889 --> 00:18:35,400
- and still, you blew it up.
- Accidentally.

471
00:18:35,424 --> 00:18:37,099
Was it an accident?

472
00:18:37,593 --> 00:18:40,805
It's the opposite of what you
went to Germany to do, Owen.

473
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:42,073
So why would you blow it?

474
00:18:42,097 --> 00:18:45,376
You're not stupid.
You don't like hurting people.

475
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,378
Why would you do it?

476
00:18:47,402 --> 00:18:50,404
Uh, I...

477
00:18:51,874 --> 00:18:53,284
I don't know.

478
00:18:53,308 --> 00:18:55,220
Well, it seems like you
might be caught in a pattern.

479
00:18:55,244 --> 00:18:57,655
And if we can find the original
event that started that pattern,

480
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,862
we can just stop it from replaying.

481
00:18:59,886 --> 00:19:00,992
That's it.

482
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:02,760
And that's your E.N.T. thing?

483
00:19:02,784 --> 00:19:05,363
It's N.E.T., but whatever.

484
00:19:05,387 --> 00:19:06,431
Are you up for that?

485
00:19:08,924 --> 00:19:11,102
Does it involve electric shocks
of any kind?

486
00:19:12,594 --> 00:19:14,205
I'm on my way to a consult,

487
00:19:14,229 --> 00:19:15,707
but I wanted to make sure
everything went okay.

488
00:19:15,731 --> 00:19:17,575
Josh was awesome.
Access site looks great.

489
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:18,910
How do you feel?

490
00:19:18,934 --> 00:19:21,045
No more stabbing knives in my back.

491
00:19:21,069 --> 00:19:22,871
- I think we're better than okay, Chief.
- Good.

492
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:25,350
Hey, what's the over/under
on the bathroom situation?

493
00:19:25,374 --> 00:19:26,417
- Ooh, ooh.
- Do I need to continue to lie here?

494
00:19:26,441 --> 00:19:28,453
- You can go.
- I'll stop by later.

495
00:19:28,477 --> 00:19:30,188
All right, coming down.

496
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:31,222
Ooh.

497
00:19:31,246 --> 00:19:33,525
Good, careful, careful.

498
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:35,991
- Any tightness?
- No, no, I'm good.

499
00:19:36,618 --> 00:19:38,429
Ah, so, what's your number one?

500
00:19:38,453 --> 00:19:40,031
UCSF, apparently.

501
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,800
Well, I have a Skype interview
with them later, actually.

502
00:19:42,824 --> 00:19:44,702
Blow it off, man. Hospitals are boring.

503
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:46,304
Find yourself a hockey team, you know?

504
00:19:46,328 --> 00:19:48,039
Fights, skates to the face,
busted shoulders.

505
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:49,607
It's a real money-maker right there.

506
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:52,877
Josh? Josh? Josh?

507
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:53,912
- Call a code!
- Oh, my God.

508
00:19:53,936 --> 00:19:54,913
We need a gurney over here.

509
00:19:54,937 --> 00:19:56,147
Oh, my God. Josh.

510
00:19:56,171 --> 00:19:57,159
- What's... What's happening?
- We need help.

511
00:19:57,161 --> 00:19:58,321
Take him outside. Get a crash cart now.

512
00:19:58,323 --> 00:19:59,584
What's happening? Oh, my God, Josh!

513
00:19:59,608 --> 00:20:00,885
- Get me cardio.
- Josh!

514
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:02,935
Start bagging him and get an ABG now!

515
00:20:10,048 --> 00:20:11,206
How's she doing?

516
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:13,518
I just need to make sure
that her heart isn't affected,

517
00:20:13,542 --> 00:20:14,982
and then I'll do a pericardial window.

518
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:16,282
It's pretty simple.

519
00:20:17,703 --> 00:20:19,952
You really shouldn't be here, Richard.

520
00:20:21,312 --> 00:20:22,957
The last time I saw Gemma,

521
00:20:22,982 --> 00:20:25,783
she was taking a cake
for 17 years' sobriety.

522
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,002
Then Ollie died,

523
00:20:29,367 --> 00:20:31,545
and I stopped going to
meetings for a while,

524
00:20:31,569 --> 00:20:33,340
and I guess Gemma did, too.

525
00:20:34,459 --> 00:20:35,801
But you didn't drink.

526
00:20:37,274 --> 00:20:38,785
No, no.

527
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:41,783
I took a baseball bat to a bar.

528
00:20:41,784 --> 00:20:43,996
And if I didn't have a lot of
money to settle with the bar,

529
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,464
I would've lost my license.

530
00:20:45,488 --> 00:20:47,146
I could've gone to prison.

531
00:20:47,857 --> 00:20:49,969
I was a dry drunk, Maggie,

532
00:20:49,993 --> 00:20:52,504
and I was angry, and it was painful,

533
00:20:52,528 --> 00:20:53,944
and...

534
00:20:54,998 --> 00:20:56,942
if it weren't for Catherine, I...

535
00:20:58,368 --> 00:21:00,980
Dr. Pierce, we have a 911 page
for cardio from ortho.

536
00:21:01,004 --> 00:21:02,047
Altman's in surgery, and so is Roberts.

537
00:21:02,071 --> 00:21:04,049
Oh, go, go. I can handle it.

538
00:21:04,073 --> 00:21:05,150
She doesn't want you on her case.

539
00:21:05,174 --> 00:21:06,852
Look, I'll talk Qadri through it.

540
00:21:06,876 --> 00:21:08,988
- Go where you're needed, Maggie.
- Okay.

541
00:21:13,082 --> 00:21:14,326
Hi, Avi.

542
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,361
How you feeling?

543
00:21:15,385 --> 00:21:16,608
Hey.

544
00:21:16,632 --> 00:21:17,963
- Look at him.
- Hello.

545
00:21:17,987 --> 00:21:19,465
Look at what I made.

546
00:21:19,489 --> 00:21:20,799
Yeah.

547
00:21:21,991 --> 00:21:24,069
It's Tucker.

548
00:21:24,093 --> 00:21:25,738
Again.

549
00:21:25,762 --> 00:21:27,239
I mean, really.

550
00:21:27,263 --> 00:21:30,576
There are worse things
than to have two good men

551
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,877
who the boy feels close to.

552
00:21:31,901 --> 00:21:34,079
So you'd be cool if Tucker got remarried

553
00:21:34,103 --> 00:21:35,547
and Tuck called his new wife "Mom"?

554
00:21:35,571 --> 00:21:37,416
Now, why would you say
a vicious thing like that?

555
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,753
I'm just saying, I just...
Can we please talk about me?

556
00:21:40,777 --> 00:21:42,988
How did you tell Tuck
that you were dating Ben?

557
00:21:43,012 --> 00:21:46,492
I... You know, on some level,
Tuck already knew.

558
00:21:46,516 --> 00:21:48,260
Look, all you have to do is show up,

559
00:21:48,284 --> 00:21:51,830
make it clear what's happening,
answer her questions.

560
00:21:51,854 --> 00:21:53,666
All she wants to know is that
you're there for her,

561
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:55,567
and you're not going anywhere
no matter what.

562
00:21:57,226 --> 00:21:59,938
Okay, so, apparently Qadri
<i>did</i> do a pregnancy test,

563
00:21:59,962 --> 00:22:01,507
but she didn't wait for the results

564
00:22:01,531 --> 00:22:03,042
because Avi was so sure she
knew what was going on.

565
00:22:03,066 --> 00:22:04,376
Okay, I'm gonna say a thing,

566
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,944
if only to spare you the humiliation

567
00:22:05,968 --> 00:22:07,112
of your girlfriend having to say it.

568
00:22:07,136 --> 00:22:09,571
- Trust, but verify.
- Trust, but verify!

569
00:22:10,573 --> 00:22:12,117
I heard about this morning, too.

570
00:22:12,141 --> 00:22:13,619
You're really batting a thousand today.

571
00:22:13,643 --> 00:22:14,920
Oh, it...

572
00:22:14,944 --> 00:22:16,388
It was in the middle of the night!

573
00:22:19,716 --> 00:22:21,226
Let's go back to Germany,

574
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:24,134
and just... to when you said

575
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:25,917
- the thing to Teddy.
- Mm-hmm.

576
00:22:25,941 --> 00:22:28,250
Just focus on what you
were feeling in that moment.

577
00:22:28,274 --> 00:22:29,670
- Okay.
- Just be there,

578
00:22:29,695 --> 00:22:30,936
and hold your arm strong.

579
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,028
Okay.

580
00:22:35,932 --> 00:22:37,339
And...

581
00:22:39,135 --> 00:22:40,746
Okay, there it is.

582
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,548
- So, now, just let that go.
- Mm-hmm.

583
00:22:42,572 --> 00:22:44,550
Think about something else,
anything else,

584
00:22:44,574 --> 00:22:48,934
and let's check
the concept of nervousness.

585
00:22:49,579 --> 00:22:51,145
Of despair.

586
00:22:51,614 --> 00:22:53,459
Feeling of distrust.

587
00:22:53,483 --> 00:22:55,094
Feeling of distrust.

588
00:22:55,118 --> 00:22:57,670
Sensitivity to someone else's distrust.

589
00:22:57,694 --> 00:22:59,064
Your distrust.

590
00:22:59,088 --> 00:23:01,734
Okay, so, it's yours.

591
00:23:01,758 --> 00:23:03,569
That's crazy.

592
00:23:03,593 --> 00:23:05,738
Do you feel distrustful of Teddy?

593
00:23:05,762 --> 00:23:06,972
No.

594
00:23:06,996 --> 00:23:08,273
Can you remember a time in your life

595
00:23:08,297 --> 00:23:09,747
when you felt that way?

596
00:23:10,933 --> 00:23:13,011
Uh...

597
00:23:13,035 --> 00:23:14,179
You know what? That's a broad question.

598
00:23:14,203 --> 00:23:16,181
Let's just check
when it could've happened.

599
00:23:16,205 --> 00:23:17,483
Conception to five.

600
00:23:17,507 --> 00:23:19,151
Listen, w-why don't we just
skip to the Iraq War,

601
00:23:19,175 --> 00:23:21,186
'cause if we're talking about
trauma, that's where it started.

602
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:22,454
- So...
- Okay.

603
00:23:22,478 --> 00:23:25,157
Was it during the Iraq War?

604
00:23:25,181 --> 00:23:26,859
No, it's not the war, then.

605
00:23:26,883 --> 00:23:28,223
Five to ten?

606
00:23:29,886 --> 00:23:31,864
Five? Six?

607
00:23:31,888 --> 00:23:34,500
Seven? Eight?

608
00:23:34,524 --> 00:23:36,815
Nine? Ten?

609
00:23:38,161 --> 00:23:41,473
Do you have a memory of feeling
distrustful when you were ten?

610
00:23:41,497 --> 00:23:42,831
No.

611
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,944
I don't know.

612
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:47,409
Okay.

613
00:23:48,037 --> 00:23:50,783
- Do you remember feeling joy at ten?
- Probably. I was ten.

614
00:23:52,074 --> 00:23:53,408
Don't look too hard.

615
00:23:55,878 --> 00:23:57,156
There's probably a memory
sitting right there.

616
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,114
Just the first thing you think of.

617
00:24:01,711 --> 00:24:03,178
I won an award.

618
00:24:05,721 --> 00:24:07,971
There was a Science Bee at school.

619
00:24:08,361 --> 00:24:10,839
And, um, lasted three days.

620
00:24:10,863 --> 00:24:12,107
All grades.

621
00:24:12,131 --> 00:24:14,478
I beat everyone at the school.

622
00:24:15,101 --> 00:24:16,178
How'd you feel about that?

623
00:24:16,202 --> 00:24:18,440
Great. Proud.

624
00:24:21,074 --> 00:24:22,694
Best that I've ever felt.

625
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:26,011
It doesn't sound like it.

626
00:24:31,617 --> 00:24:33,696
So you <i>told</i> him to go to Germany.

627
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,364
Because every time I looked at him,

628
00:24:35,388 --> 00:24:36,765
I could see him thinking about <i>her.</i>

629
00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:39,134
And he went, and she rejected him.

630
00:24:39,158 --> 00:24:41,303
He went to Germany, declared his love,

631
00:24:41,327 --> 00:24:43,272
and she declared it back.

632
00:24:43,296 --> 00:24:45,040
She loves him, Tom. She always has.

633
00:24:45,064 --> 00:24:46,136
And... And now there's a baby.

634
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,176
I was kind of hoping she was

635
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,144
a one-night-stand-between-friends baby.

636
00:24:49,168 --> 00:24:51,814
Nope, she is definitely a love baby.

637
00:24:51,838 --> 00:24:52,881
Except for the salty brunette

638
00:24:52,905 --> 00:24:55,150
who keeps showing up back in his bed.

639
00:24:55,174 --> 00:24:57,286
Tom, I'm telling you this as a friend...

640
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:00,122
Owen and Teddy are inevitable.

641
00:25:00,146 --> 00:25:01,123
Hey!

642
00:25:01,147 --> 00:25:02,057
Stem cells are here.

643
00:25:02,081 --> 00:25:03,845
OR 2 is prepped.

644
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:04,927
My man!

645
00:25:04,951 --> 00:25:06,095
See you in there.

646
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:07,262
Yeah. Ah. Mm!

647
00:25:07,286 --> 00:25:08,495
- Shut up.
- Shepherd.

648
00:25:09,622 --> 00:25:10,966
We're about to perform
an experimental procedure

649
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,768
in which we might give a paralyzed woman

650
00:25:12,792 --> 00:25:14,002
the use of her arms.

651
00:25:14,026 --> 00:25:16,795
"Inevitable" doesn't scare me.

652
00:25:21,634 --> 00:25:23,979
Let's go off bypass.

653
00:25:24,003 --> 00:25:25,614
I-I was careful. I...

654
00:25:25,638 --> 00:25:27,249
I don't know if you used
the wrong amount of pressure

655
00:25:27,273 --> 00:25:28,951
or if the cement was too liquid,

656
00:25:28,975 --> 00:25:30,652
but the pulmonary artery is destroyed.

657
00:25:30,676 --> 00:25:32,821
I pieced it together, but
the graft is barely holding.

658
00:25:32,845 --> 00:25:33,922
What can I do?

659
00:25:33,946 --> 00:25:36,125
This is a temporary fix at best.

660
00:25:36,149 --> 00:25:38,067
We could consider putting
him on the transplant list.

661
00:25:38,092 --> 00:25:40,247
- Transplant?
- If you can think of a better way

662
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:41,410
to save your patient from dying,

663
00:25:41,434 --> 00:25:42,698
I'd love to hear it.

664
00:25:42,722 --> 00:25:44,136
Damn it. Schmitt, suction!

665
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,200
The repair didn't hold?

666
00:25:45,224 --> 00:25:47,035
There is nothing here to hold onto.

667
00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:49,138
Clamp!

668
00:25:49,162 --> 00:25:50,616
Flap!

669
00:25:51,364 --> 00:25:52,341
Suction!

670
00:25:55,635 --> 00:25:57,581
I ran home after school.

671
00:25:58,204 --> 00:26:01,150
I had this big certificate with a seal.

672
00:26:01,174 --> 00:26:04,953
You know, like, uh, foil.

673
00:26:04,977 --> 00:26:06,465
I remember that.

674
00:26:07,814 --> 00:26:10,927
And, uh, my mom was
waiting for me in the kitchen.

675
00:26:12,251 --> 00:26:13,462
And I was about to show her it,

676
00:26:13,486 --> 00:26:16,498
and then she said, "Owen, sit down."

677
00:26:16,522 --> 00:26:18,014
So I sat down,

678
00:26:18,038 --> 00:26:20,803
and... she told me

679
00:26:20,827 --> 00:26:22,439
that my dad died...

680
00:26:23,896 --> 00:26:25,397
that day.

681
00:26:27,667 --> 00:26:29,613
- So...
- I'm sorry.

682
00:26:30,369 --> 00:26:33,682
What about the prize? The certificate.

683
00:26:33,706 --> 00:26:34,983
What?

684
00:26:35,007 --> 00:26:36,985
Oh. I-I didn't tell her about that.

685
00:26:37,009 --> 00:26:38,854
I didn't tell anybody.

686
00:26:38,878 --> 00:26:41,256
I was, um, you know...

687
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,836
I was ashamed that I was so proud,

688
00:26:45,418 --> 00:26:50,592
that I was so... happy
when she was so sad.

689
00:26:53,459 --> 00:26:55,666
And my dad was, um...

690
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:58,173
Owen, I think you've been
reliving this moment ever since.

691
00:26:58,197 --> 00:27:00,274
No, no, no.

692
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:03,111
I think you don't trust joy.

693
00:27:03,135 --> 00:27:06,748
I think you stop it before
something terrible happens,

694
00:27:06,772 --> 00:27:09,918
before the bad news comes.

695
00:27:09,942 --> 00:27:12,020
But it's not coming anymore.

696
00:27:12,044 --> 00:27:14,223
That moment is over.

697
00:27:14,247 --> 00:27:17,244
It came, and you're okay.

698
00:27:17,884 --> 00:27:19,784
So let's stop the replay.

699
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,301
How?

700
00:27:26,325 --> 00:27:28,130
Okay, I want you to...

701
00:27:29,155 --> 00:27:32,501
I want you to put your hand on
your wrist like this, okay?

702
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:34,804
And then put your hand on your forehead.

703
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,646
And just sit and breathe.

704
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:08,685
<i>Dr. Franco, please call extension 523.</i>

705
00:28:08,709 --> 00:28:12,566
<i>Dr. Franco, please call extension 523.</i>

706
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:14,194
You don't quit, huh?

707
00:28:14,218 --> 00:28:15,929
You bring a "Big Book"?

708
00:28:15,953 --> 00:28:17,831
You planning to read to me

709
00:28:17,855 --> 00:28:20,100
while I'm too weak to stop you?

710
00:28:20,124 --> 00:28:21,401
I just wanted to update you.

711
00:28:21,425 --> 00:28:24,304
Dr. Pierce had an emergency
with another patient.

712
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:27,374
So... she didn't do your surgery.

713
00:28:27,564 --> 00:28:29,275
<i>I</i> did.

714
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:31,211
Oh.

715
00:28:32,369 --> 00:28:34,347
So I can sue you.

716
00:28:34,371 --> 00:28:35,949
Buy me a new pair of shoes.

717
00:28:35,973 --> 00:28:37,350
You do whatever you want to.

718
00:28:37,374 --> 00:28:39,352
Although it would make you
a serious ingrate,

719
00:28:39,376 --> 00:28:41,554
seeing how I saved your damn life,

720
00:28:41,578 --> 00:28:43,356
you stubborn drunk!

721
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:56,002
Ow, ow. Hurts.

722
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:57,504
Hurts when I laugh.

723
00:28:57,528 --> 00:28:58,671
Well, it ought to hurt.

724
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,407
You punctured your heart with a shoe.

725
00:29:00,431 --> 00:29:01,474
Heh.

726
00:29:01,498 --> 00:29:03,576
That's a new bottom if I ever heard one.

727
00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:08,148
I had 17 years.

728
00:29:08,172 --> 00:29:09,564
I know.

729
00:29:11,442 --> 00:29:13,019
I want 'em back.

730
00:29:17,081 --> 00:29:19,759
The years don't matter, Gemma.

731
00:29:19,783 --> 00:29:21,618
Just today.

732
00:29:22,425 --> 00:29:26,405
It's just... It's just one day at a time.

733
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:30,243
You start your count all
over again and tell me that.

734
00:29:30,794 --> 00:29:33,440
Well, not long ago, I almost did.

735
00:29:33,464 --> 00:29:36,176
I slid my chip across a bar,

736
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,593
traded it for a line of shots.

737
00:29:38,969 --> 00:29:40,345
You did what?

738
00:29:41,271 --> 00:29:43,349
It was a very bad day.

739
00:29:43,373 --> 00:29:45,100
Tell me more.

740
00:29:45,876 --> 00:29:47,936
You stubborn drunk.

741
00:30:00,324 --> 00:30:02,302
Thank you for finding this study.

742
00:30:02,326 --> 00:30:05,138
Thank you for inspiring me
to find this study.

743
00:30:05,162 --> 00:30:06,172
I'll thank you both to stop

744
00:30:06,196 --> 00:30:08,108
before I vomit into an open spine.

745
00:30:08,132 --> 00:30:09,909
Okay, suspend her breathing.

746
00:30:11,568 --> 00:30:13,379
Okay.

747
00:30:18,142 --> 00:30:20,787
I know you love Ben
and I know you didn't mean to,

748
00:30:20,811 --> 00:30:22,489
but it hurt your father's feelings,

749
00:30:22,513 --> 00:30:24,757
so you just have to say you're sorry

750
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,826
and go back to calling Ben "Ben."

751
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:27,994
Wait, hold on.

752
00:30:28,018 --> 00:30:29,062
Pop-Pop.

753
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:34,501
- Hey, what happened?
- Something went wrong.

754
00:30:34,525 --> 00:30:35,635
- They took him.
- What? Josh should be out by...

755
00:30:35,659 --> 00:30:37,470
Dr. Bailey, something went really wrong.

756
00:30:37,494 --> 00:30:40,173
Okay, uh, I'll find out, okay?

757
00:30:40,197 --> 00:30:41,812
I'll be right back.

758
00:30:49,106 --> 00:30:50,450
No.

759
00:30:51,775 --> 00:30:53,853
How?

760
00:30:53,877 --> 00:30:56,022
Massive pulmonary artery embolism.

761
00:30:56,046 --> 00:30:57,290
The bone cement...

762
00:30:57,314 --> 00:30:58,525
Okay, wait, I don't want
to hear it from you.

763
00:30:58,549 --> 00:31:00,050
I want to hear it from <i>you.</i>

764
00:31:01,685 --> 00:31:03,997
The cement leaked, causing a blood clot.

765
00:31:04,021 --> 00:31:05,265
He went into cardiac arrest.

766
00:31:05,289 --> 00:31:08,201
Dr. Pierce tried to repair
the pulmonary artery.

767
00:31:08,225 --> 00:31:09,502
We tried everything we could, and we...

768
00:31:09,526 --> 00:31:12,438
You made a mistake on a
healthy 21-year-old man.

769
00:31:12,462 --> 00:31:14,507
And that man is now dead.
That's what happened.

770
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,653
Schmitt, you close.

771
00:31:26,677 --> 00:31:27,787
And you...

772
00:31:27,811 --> 00:31:29,556
you are gonna stand right next to me

773
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,358
and take in every moment
of that grandfather's grief.

774
00:31:32,382 --> 00:31:35,795
And if you're a good surgeon,
you'll remember it.

775
00:31:35,819 --> 00:31:37,864
And you'll never make this mistake again.

776
00:31:55,939 --> 00:31:59,185
Look, the way I see it is we can
keep working in awkward silence

777
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:00,648
until it's time for you to go home, or...

778
00:32:00,673 --> 00:32:02,378
- I vote that.
- ...or

779
00:32:02,403 --> 00:32:04,490
you can tell me what you
meant by "I was right."

780
00:32:04,514 --> 00:32:06,893
'Cause I could, maybe, help you feel,

781
00:32:06,917 --> 00:32:08,595
I don't know, one drop less crappy.

782
00:32:08,619 --> 00:32:10,230
You told me not to go looking,

783
00:32:10,254 --> 00:32:12,325
and you were right. That's all, so...

784
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:15,001
Jo, I told you not to go looking
if everything was okay.

785
00:32:15,025 --> 00:32:17,370
You went looking, so maybe
everything was not okay.

786
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:18,571
Maybe you needed that.

787
00:32:18,595 --> 00:32:20,440
No, no. You know what? I had everything.

788
00:32:20,464 --> 00:32:23,409
I had a marriage and a job and...

789
00:32:23,433 --> 00:32:25,845
Yeah, Alex is right here.

790
00:32:25,869 --> 00:32:28,114
You got a great job right here.

791
00:32:28,138 --> 00:32:29,249
You're doing it right now.

792
00:32:29,273 --> 00:32:31,184
I'm spraying water on a paper towel,

793
00:32:31,208 --> 00:32:33,753
and Alex is anything but happy.

794
00:32:33,777 --> 00:32:35,622
'Cause he's worried about you.

795
00:32:35,646 --> 00:32:37,557
He's trying to help. Come on.

796
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:39,259
I knew it. I knew it.

797
00:32:39,283 --> 00:32:41,694
- He sent you here.
- No, he didn't.

798
00:32:41,718 --> 00:32:43,096
Jo, that's not what this is.

799
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,130
Then what is it?

800
00:32:44,154 --> 00:32:45,698
The guy's worried, okay?

801
00:32:45,722 --> 00:32:47,400
He's wondering.

802
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:48,768
Why don't you just communicate with him?

803
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:50,737
'Cause it would only hurt,
and it won't help.

804
00:32:53,897 --> 00:32:55,132
You don't know that.

805
00:32:55,156 --> 00:32:56,396
I had all this happy,

806
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,378
and I just... tossed it aside

807
00:32:58,402 --> 00:32:59,612
like it would always exist.

808
00:32:59,636 --> 00:33:01,080
I mean, we... we see it all the time.

809
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:04,417
We diagnose patients
with terrible diseases

810
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:06,586
or we tell someone that
their husband dropped dead

811
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:07,887
of... of a heart attack,

812
00:33:07,911 --> 00:33:09,389
and all they can say is
they were fine yesterday,

813
00:33:09,413 --> 00:33:10,390
and they were.

814
00:33:10,414 --> 00:33:11,624
They were fine.

815
00:33:11,648 --> 00:33:13,266
I was fine.

816
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,595
And I took it for granted,

817
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:18,931
and now it feels impossible
to get it back.

818
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,943
It was Mer.

819
00:33:25,262 --> 00:33:27,740
It was Meredith that asked me
to look in on you.

820
00:33:27,764 --> 00:33:31,577
She knows how our parents
can screw with our heads.

821
00:33:31,601 --> 00:33:33,179
I'm here, okay?

822
00:33:33,203 --> 00:33:34,247
I'm working.

823
00:33:34,271 --> 00:33:36,456
You came to work drunk, Jo.

824
00:33:37,674 --> 00:33:39,459
You're still drunk.

825
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:41,654
I can smell it.

826
00:33:41,678 --> 00:33:43,589
I'm thinking vodka in the water bottle.

827
00:33:43,613 --> 00:33:45,826
I'm glad you had the decency
not to see any patients today.

828
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:46,899
That's nice.

829
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:48,133
You don't know what you're talking about.

830
00:33:48,157 --> 00:33:49,696
You're in a lot of pain,

831
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,298
and you're trying to numb it.
I get that, okay?

832
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:53,499
It's not gonna work.

833
00:33:53,523 --> 00:33:55,501
I'm telling you.
You're gonna ruin your life.

834
00:33:55,525 --> 00:33:57,770
Jo, don't leave.

835
00:33:57,794 --> 00:33:59,505
Just talk to me for a second.

836
00:33:59,529 --> 00:34:00,773
I'm trying to help you.

837
00:34:07,571 --> 00:34:10,156
You set foot in this hospital
drunk again,

838
00:34:11,475 --> 00:34:13,820
you're not gonna be met with compassion.

839
00:34:43,346 --> 00:34:44,857
The surgery went well.

840
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:46,393
I see that.

841
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:47,610
Yours?

842
00:34:48,455 --> 00:34:49,946
Did not.

843
00:34:51,024 --> 00:34:52,201
I'm sorry.

844
00:34:53,827 --> 00:34:55,171
And Dr. Pierce

845
00:34:55,195 --> 00:34:57,306
did everything she could, but...

846
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:59,642
...the damage was too extensive.

847
00:34:59,666 --> 00:35:01,811
I'm...

848
00:35:01,835 --> 00:35:04,080
You said we'd be lucky
to have that doctor.

849
00:35:04,104 --> 00:35:08,117
You said Josh would be in good hands.

850
00:35:08,141 --> 00:35:11,120
- What happened?
- I know. I know.

851
00:35:11,144 --> 00:35:13,589
Oh.

852
00:35:13,613 --> 00:35:16,659
I'm so sorry.

853
00:35:19,352 --> 00:35:20,977
My boy.

854
00:35:33,633 --> 00:35:35,611
Hey.

855
00:35:35,635 --> 00:35:38,103
Yeah, it's nice to meet you.

856
00:35:46,179 --> 00:35:47,290
Hey.

857
00:35:52,919 --> 00:35:55,331
Okay, now all we do is wait.

858
00:35:55,355 --> 00:35:58,125
I hope we didn't
get their hopes up for nothing.

859
00:35:58,149 --> 00:36:00,836
Oh. Thank you.

860
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:03,973
How do you feel about sushi burritos?

861
00:36:05,198 --> 00:36:08,344
That sounds like a culinary abomination,

862
00:36:08,368 --> 00:36:10,485
and I need one immediately.

863
00:36:11,438 --> 00:36:13,215
Could you give me one minute, though?

864
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:20,767
Look, I know you think you're being brave

865
00:36:20,791 --> 00:36:22,330
by fighting for Teddy,

866
00:36:22,978 --> 00:36:24,593
but that's not what's happening here.

867
00:36:24,617 --> 00:36:27,096
Y-Your hopes are up. They're way up...

868
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,197
And hope scares you.

869
00:36:28,221 --> 00:36:29,398
And that's why you're, uh,

870
00:36:29,422 --> 00:36:32,068
hiding behind a very pretty,
very decent guy

871
00:36:32,092 --> 00:36:35,271
to cover the fact that you're
still hung up on Owen Hunt.

872
00:36:35,295 --> 00:36:38,062
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

873
00:36:38,063 --> 00:36:39,808
A thing I've learned

874
00:36:39,832 --> 00:36:42,744
is that life is a series of choices.

875
00:36:42,768 --> 00:36:47,048
And that sometimes,
there is an easier, softer way.

876
00:36:47,072 --> 00:36:52,053
- H-He is uncomplicated, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

877
00:36:52,077 --> 00:36:53,522
And it so refreshing.

878
00:36:53,546 --> 00:36:54,902
- Oh.
- It is like diving into

879
00:36:54,927 --> 00:36:56,258
a cold pool on a hot day.

880
00:36:56,282 --> 00:36:57,259
Ah.

881
00:36:57,283 --> 00:37:00,095
Am I hung up on Owen?

882
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:01,663
Sure.

883
00:37:01,687 --> 00:37:03,705
Maybe I always will be.

884
00:37:04,456 --> 00:37:06,601
But am I using Link?

885
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:08,370
No.

886
00:37:08,394 --> 00:37:10,920
I'm just choosing an easier path.

887
00:37:12,171 --> 00:37:14,075
You might want to try it.

888
00:37:31,383 --> 00:37:33,028
Hey.

889
00:37:33,052 --> 00:37:35,730
I was looking all over for you.

890
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:38,066
Thought you might've tried to postpone.

891
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:40,902
Can't just postpone a job interview.

892
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:42,604
Yeah, I know.

893
00:37:42,628 --> 00:37:45,073
But they could make
an exception, you know?

894
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:47,208
Because of what happened today.

895
00:37:47,232 --> 00:37:49,878
Oh, you mean 'cause I
screwed up so completely

896
00:37:49,902 --> 00:37:51,212
that someone's dead?

897
00:37:51,236 --> 00:37:54,049
Oh, yeah, sure, let me just
call up the hiring committee

898
00:37:54,073 --> 00:37:56,007
and fill them in, Levi.

899
00:37:56,942 --> 00:37:58,053
So, you think
you're in the best condition

900
00:37:58,077 --> 00:37:59,988
to interview for your dream job?

901
00:38:00,012 --> 00:38:02,305
Just e-mail 'em, okay?

902
00:38:03,015 --> 00:38:04,326
Then we can get out of here.

903
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:05,594
No, you don't get it!

904
00:38:05,618 --> 00:38:08,296
'Cause you let failure
hold you back your whole life.

905
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,521
It's basically your entire identity.

906
00:38:11,857 --> 00:38:13,524
But it's not mine.

907
00:38:16,295 --> 00:38:18,073
<i>So much of the world operates</i>

908
00:38:18,097 --> 00:38:19,697
<i>without us ever thinking about it.</i>

909
00:38:21,367 --> 00:38:22,944
<i>Dr. Kim, it's nice to see you.</i>

910
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:25,180
<i>Your application
is tremendously impressive.</i>

911
00:38:25,204 --> 00:38:26,314
Hey, Dr. Hogans,

912
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:28,583
thank you for making the time
to talk to me.

913
00:38:28,607 --> 00:38:29,682
I've wanted to be a part of

914
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:31,586
your program since I...

915
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:34,990
...since I first, uh,
chose ortho as my specialty.

916
00:38:35,014 --> 00:38:38,493
<i>We expect it to work out in our favor,</i>

917
00:38:38,517 --> 00:38:40,918
<i>and, most of the time, it does.</i>

918
00:38:59,238 --> 00:39:02,050
Let's just go home, order in.

919
00:39:02,074 --> 00:39:05,520
I have to go to my place
and get some clean clothes.

920
00:39:05,544 --> 00:39:08,156
I'm so tired, I might just crash there.

921
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,247
Move in with me.

922
00:39:11,684 --> 00:39:12,959
What?

923
00:39:13,419 --> 00:39:15,130
I love you, Maggie.

924
00:39:15,154 --> 00:39:17,899
I don't want to take it for granted.

925
00:39:18,798 --> 00:39:20,425
I don't want to miss it.

926
00:39:22,161 --> 00:39:23,505
Yeah.

927
00:39:23,529 --> 00:39:25,373
Move in with me.

928
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:31,846
<i>We worry about the future
and think about the past.</i>

929
00:39:37,063 --> 00:39:38,219
Oh...

930
00:39:39,178 --> 00:39:40,488
Okay.

931
00:39:40,512 --> 00:39:41,556
Hey, come here.

932
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,857
Come here, come here, come here.

933
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:44,492
Hey.

934
00:39:44,516 --> 00:39:46,862
_

935
00:39:49,922 --> 00:39:51,556
Teddy. Look.

936
00:39:51,603 --> 00:39:53,942
_

937
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,104
_

938
00:39:57,129 --> 00:39:58,479
Okay.

939
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:03,945
<i>And we so often miss
what's right in front of us.</i>

940
00:40:06,638 --> 00:40:08,349
You were drinking at work?

941
00:40:11,043 --> 00:40:14,222
- Jo, I'm done.
- The field...

942
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:15,490
You hear me? I'm done.

943
00:40:15,514 --> 00:40:17,358
I need you to hear me.
I need you to talk to me.

944
00:40:18,751 --> 00:40:20,628
I love you, Jo. I love you, but I...

945
00:40:20,652 --> 00:40:22,564
If you love me, you will let me...

946
00:40:22,588 --> 00:40:24,632
No, no, no, no, we're not
playing that game anymore.

947
00:40:24,656 --> 00:40:27,368
We're not playing that "if you
love me, you'd leave me alone."

948
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:29,692
You went to Pittsburgh, and we were good.

949
00:40:29,716 --> 00:40:31,372
- Stop.
- We were good, and then you come back,

950
00:40:31,396 --> 00:40:33,108
and you won't talk to me,
and you're drinking at work.

951
00:40:33,132 --> 00:40:34,175
Please.

952
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:35,610
So how about I just go to Pittsburgh

953
00:40:35,634 --> 00:40:37,312
and find out what the hell
happened to my wife?!

954
00:40:39,304 --> 00:40:40,782
Huh?!

955
00:40:40,806 --> 00:40:45,153
<i>We take what's good and easy
and working for granted...</i>

956
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:51,059
I will talk to you
when I'm ready to talk to you.

957
00:40:51,083 --> 00:40:54,262
And if you ever threaten
to go to Pittsburgh again,

958
00:40:54,286 --> 00:40:56,131
I will leave you.

959
00:40:57,523 --> 00:40:59,167
Are we clear?

960
00:41:00,626 --> 00:41:02,837
If you ever come to work drunk again,

961
00:41:02,861 --> 00:41:04,272
I'll tell Bailey.

962
00:41:06,999 --> 00:41:08,309
Great.

963
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:09,911
We have a deal.

964
00:41:09,935 --> 00:41:13,412
<i>...until it's no longer good
and easy and working for us.</i>

965
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:17,952
<i>It's normal, but we can do better</i>

966
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:20,121
<i>because there are tiny, beautiful gifts</i>

967
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:21,122
<i>we're given every day.</i>

968
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:22,747
Here we go.

969
00:41:24,116 --> 00:41:30,465
So, the reason why you saw
Dr. DeLuca here the other night

970
00:41:30,489 --> 00:41:33,968
was because he and I have been
spending more time together.

971
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:35,170
Is he your boyfriend?

972
00:41:35,194 --> 00:41:36,171
He is.

973
00:41:36,195 --> 00:41:37,672
What's that mean?

974
00:41:37,696 --> 00:41:41,442
Well, that means that I like him a lot.

975
00:41:41,466 --> 00:41:43,812
Not more than you, but a lot.

976
00:41:43,836 --> 00:41:45,513
Are you gonna kiss him?

977
00:41:45,537 --> 00:41:46,548
Probably.

978
00:41:46,572 --> 00:41:48,716
- Ew, gross!
- Oh, gross!

979
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,819
Is he gonna sleep on the couch again?

980
00:41:50,843 --> 00:41:53,288
No, he won't be sleeping on the couch,

981
00:41:53,312 --> 00:41:56,324
but he may be coming around
a lot more, so...

982
00:41:56,348 --> 00:41:58,359
But I'm not going anywhere.

983
00:41:58,383 --> 00:41:59,427
You're stuck with me.

984
00:41:59,451 --> 00:42:00,895
Can he leave his guitar at home?

985
00:42:02,454 --> 00:42:05,567
<i>And it's up to us to
appreciate them to the fullest</i>

986
00:42:05,591 --> 00:42:06,901
<i>while we can.</i>

9999
