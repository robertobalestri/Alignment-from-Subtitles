1
00:00:35,348 --> 00:00:36,281
Violet!

2
00:00:36,349 --> 00:00:37,549
Violet.

3
00:00:43,823 --> 00:00:45,323
Oh, God.

4
00:00:47,193 --> 00:00:49,461
Hey, Vi, you left your door open.
Call 9-1-1.

5
00:00:49,528 --> 00:00:51,463
She's hypotensive with massive blood loss.

6
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,365
Respiratory rate is 8.
Elevate her legs. I'm calling them.

7
00:00:53,432 --> 00:00:55,567
Pete.
Call them.

8
00:00:55,635 --> 00:00:58,236
She's still alive, but I can
barely palpate her pulse.

9
00:00:58,304 --> 00:01:00,939
Pete, where is the baby?

10
00:01:01,007 --> 00:01:03,675
I don't know.

11
00:01:03,743 --> 00:01:05,210
This is Dr. Naomi Bennett.

12
00:01:05,278 --> 00:01:07,345
II need an ambulance immediately

13
00:01:07,413 --> 00:01:09,514
at 3-2-6 Las Brisas Canyon.

15
00:01:11,584 --> 00:01:14,452
B.P. is 70 palp, resps 8 and shallow.

16
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,155
Pulse is 130 after 2 liters of N.S.
Trauma "b."

17
00:01:17,223 --> 00:01:19,891
I got an O.R. standing by.
Montgomery's on her way.
I'm here.

18
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:22,460
Set up a central line. We need
blood. What's her blood type?

19
00:01:22,528 --> 00:01:25,664
Does anybody know her blood type?
C.B.C., chem-7, cross and type times 4.

20
00:01:25,731 --> 00:01:28,033
Set up a rapid infuser.
Where's the baby?

21
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,968
We don't know.
There was a placenta

22
00:01:30,036 --> 00:01:31,903
and... and the cord was cut, but there wasn't...

23
00:01:31,971 --> 00:01:34,005
Okay, I got this, Pete.
I should know her blood type.

24
00:01:34,073 --> 00:01:36,041
Pete, I'm taking over, all right? Stay here.

25
00:01:36,108 --> 00:01:38,710
Cooper, a little help.
I... I was there. I was there and I heard a noise.

26
00:01:38,778 --> 00:01:41,446
I was right at her door, and I left.
Okay, Nai, let's go. Come on.

27
00:01:41,514 --> 00:01:43,548
Can somebody get her a trauma gown, please?
You gotta use O-neg.

28
00:01:43,616 --> 00:01:45,484
Pete, just let me... let me do my job.
She's lost so much blood.

29
00:01:45,552 --> 00:01:46,887
Okay, just wait here.
No, no, I gotta be in here with her.

30
00:01:46,955 --> 00:01:49,990
No, Dr. Wilder. Look at me.
We don't have time for this.

31
00:01:50,058 --> 00:01:51,059
I don't have time to convince you

32
00:01:51,126 --> 00:01:53,428
to let me do what I know how to do.

33
00:01:53,495 --> 00:01:56,030
There is no time. Wait here.
Cooper. Pete.

34
00:02:02,635 --> 00:02:04,636
We have a kitchen!

35
00:02:04,704 --> 00:02:06,571
At work, we have a... a kitchen.

36
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:08,073
It's nice.

37
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,075
At my last office, I had a, um,

38
00:02:10,142 --> 00:02:12,110
I had a mini fridge wedged under my desk.

39
00:02:12,178 --> 00:02:14,112
That's where I kept the urine samples.

40
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,947
This is fancy.

41
00:02:16,015 --> 00:02:19,184
What do you think about Sam and Naomi?
They seem nice.

42
00:02:19,251 --> 00:02:21,686
I mean, I like 'em 'cause they,

43
00:02:21,754 --> 00:02:23,688
you know, hired me.

44
00:02:23,756 --> 00:02:25,690
Why? What do you think?

45
00:02:25,758 --> 00:02:27,692
They're happy.

46
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,694
They're... they're happy people.

47
00:02:29,762 --> 00:02:31,796
They're happy people
in love with each other.

48
00:02:31,864 --> 00:02:33,665
It's creepy.

49
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:36,067
Do you think it's real, the love?

50
00:02:36,135 --> 00:02:39,170
Oh, it's real. Oh, my god. Oh, I'm just... 
I was... I'm sorry, Sam.

51
00:02:39,238 --> 00:02:42,273
I think what she meant to say
was thank you for our jobs.

52
00:02:42,341 --> 00:02:45,210
If he's trying to get you to work here, say yes.

53
00:02:45,277 --> 00:02:47,379
It's fancy. We have a kitchen.
No, I'm just... 

54
00:02:47,446 --> 00:02:49,581
I have my own practice in Beverly Hills... 

55
00:02:49,648 --> 00:02:51,750
Infectious disease.
I... I'm Violet. This is, uh... 

56
00:02:51,817 --> 00:02:53,818
Cooper Freedman. Hi.
Hi. Pete Wilder.

57
00:02:53,886 --> 00:02:55,720
This is Pete, the friend I told you about.

58
00:02:55,788 --> 00:02:57,355
Oh, yes. Pete.
Right.

59
00:02:57,423 --> 00:02:59,624
Oh, yes. What? What am I missing?

60
00:02:59,692 --> 00:03:02,394
I'm a patient. I'm...
Supposed to be a patient of--

61
00:03:02,461 --> 00:03:05,363
Oh. Sam wants me to speak
with Violet about my wife.

62
00:03:05,431 --> 00:03:07,432
Oh. Divorced?

63
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,467
Dead.
She died four days ago.

64
00:03:09,535 --> 00:03:11,002
Hey.

65
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,704
Hey. I came up with a name.

66
00:03:12,772 --> 00:03:14,873
Oceanside Wellness.

67
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,108
That's good, right?

68
00:03:17,176 --> 00:03:18,943
Yeah.
What?

69
00:03:21,981 --> 00:03:23,948
What happened?
Um, someone...

70
00:03:24,016 --> 00:03:25,817
took Violet's baby.

71
00:03:25,885 --> 00:03:28,286
They cut her and took her baby.
Katie. It had to be Katie.

72
00:03:28,354 --> 00:03:30,488
Violet's patient?
I'm going in there.

73
00:03:30,556 --> 00:03:32,157
No, no. Come on.
I'm family.

74
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,993
We're all family here,
all right? Addison's got this.

75
00:03:35,061 --> 00:03:37,462
She... she said she wanted to be
with me. She said she loved me.

76
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,497
She said... we should get you cleaned up.

77
00:03:39,565 --> 00:03:41,699
What?
Blood, man. You're covered in blood.

78
00:03:41,767 --> 00:03:45,070
All right, come on.
Come on. Right this way.

79
00:03:45,137 --> 00:03:46,571
Daddy?
Yeah.

80
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:48,106
Someone got hurt?

81
00:03:48,174 --> 00:03:50,241
Uh, yeah, yeah. Someone got hurt.

82
00:03:53,813 --> 00:03:55,947
Sam says you're great.

83
00:03:56,015 --> 00:03:59,050
Well, he doesn't really know me,
but, uh, but I am. I'm great.

84
00:03:59,118 --> 00:04:00,919
Well, he's great, too... Sam.

85
00:04:00,986 --> 00:04:02,887
You're gonna like working for him.

86
00:04:02,955 --> 00:04:04,956
And, well, these offices are nice.

87
00:04:05,024 --> 00:04:06,458
They're big.

88
00:04:06,525 --> 00:04:09,327
I'm stalling.

89
00:04:09,395 --> 00:04:13,164
Therapy is hard for some people.
It's not hard. It's just artificial.

90
00:04:13,232 --> 00:04:15,433
Sitting down and telling
your innermost thoughts

91
00:04:15,501 --> 00:04:18,770
to someone you don't know?
Did you tell all your innermost thoughts

92
00:04:18,838 --> 00:04:20,271
to someone you do know?

93
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,273
Did you do that with your wife?

94
00:04:22,341 --> 00:04:24,175
Because that's what we're here to talk about, right?

95
00:04:24,243 --> 00:04:26,177
Look, I'm not here for me.

96
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:27,846
I'm here because it's easier

97
00:04:27,913 --> 00:04:29,914
than having Sam and Naomi be all over me

98
00:04:29,982 --> 00:04:31,850
because they can't get the fact that I'm coping.

99
00:04:31,917 --> 00:04:34,419
My wife died, and it's awful, and I'm coping.

100
00:04:34,487 --> 00:04:37,322
Do you want to tell me about her?
No. I...

101
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:38,790
Her name's Anna.

102
00:04:38,858 --> 00:04:40,291
It was.

103
00:04:40,359 --> 00:04:42,327
She died of an aneurysm in her sleep.

104
00:04:42,394 --> 00:04:46,131
So she didn't have any pain.
There was no suffering.

105
00:04:46,198 --> 00:04:48,099
Look, I... I respect what you do,

106
00:04:48,167 --> 00:04:50,101
and I get that Sam and Naomi think

107
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:52,604
That I'm not showing the right emotion

108
00:04:52,671 --> 00:04:54,639
or I'm in denial or I'm not talking enough,

109
00:04:54,707 --> 00:04:56,241
but I'm a private person.

110
00:04:56,308 --> 00:04:59,177
It's not that I'm not feeling
this, that I don't miss her.

111
00:04:59,245 --> 00:05:01,146
Uh, maybe I'm not displaying my emotions,

112
00:05:01,213 --> 00:05:03,281
but I'm feeling this in my own way.

113
00:05:03,349 --> 00:05:04,916
I understand that. I... I do.

114
00:05:04,984 --> 00:05:07,552
But, um, I still think, as a professional,

115
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,988
talking about those feelings will help.

116
00:05:10,055 --> 00:05:13,258
I just... don't really have anything else to say.

117
00:05:13,325 --> 00:05:14,759
I... this... 

118
00:05:14,827 --> 00:05:17,462
What happened is horrible.

119
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,899
But I'll get through it in time...

120
00:05:20,966 --> 00:05:22,834
On my own.

121
00:05:22,902 --> 00:05:26,237
You say she had a mental illness, the attacker?

122
00:05:26,305 --> 00:05:27,805
Yes. Katie. Katie Kent.

123
00:05:27,873 --> 00:05:30,608
Is someone out looking for the baby?
We put out an... 

124
00:05:30,676 --> 00:05:33,511
It's been almost two hours.
We put out an amber alert.
Everyone is looking.

125
00:05:33,579 --> 00:05:36,247
Have you checked her apartment?
She's cleared out. Everyone is looking, sir.

126
00:05:36,315 --> 00:05:38,950
You were at the crime scene?
Yes, I told the other officer.
I found her.

127
00:05:39,018 --> 00:05:41,986
Maybe if you'd put something on tv... 
Sir, what is your relationship to the victim?

128
00:05:42,054 --> 00:05:43,955
Violet! Her name is Violet!
Pete... 

129
00:05:44,023 --> 00:05:45,790
The guy is standing her asking me questions,

130
00:05:45,858 --> 00:05:48,259
and the woman is out... 
Just let him do his job.

131
00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:50,428
Sir, your relationship to... Violet.
He's her boyfriend.

132
00:05:50,496 --> 00:05:53,565
I was seeing a patient upstairs and I... I heard.

133
00:05:53,632 --> 00:05:56,034
I'm sorry. I should've called.
And who are you?

134
00:05:56,101 --> 00:05:58,303
I'm the baby's father.

135
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,605
Uh, well, kind... kind of the baby's father.

136
00:06:00,673 --> 00:06:03,408
Maybe the father. So is he.
We're both... we're the baby's father.

137
00:06:03,475 --> 00:06:04,909
It's a long story.

138
00:06:04,977 --> 00:06:07,979
It's... just wear a condom.
Tell your friends.

139
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,335
There's a waiting room...

140
00:06:30,402 --> 00:06:33,137
with chairs.

141
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,908
I had to call Violet's parents.

142
00:06:36,976 --> 00:06:41,279
Those people are...
Okay, yes, they are worried.

143
00:06:41,347 --> 00:06:43,314
But they're on vacation in London.

144
00:06:43,382 --> 00:06:45,717
They didn't even contemplate
getting on an airplane to L.A.

145
00:06:45,784 --> 00:06:47,719
They didn't even think about it.

146
00:06:47,786 --> 00:06:50,255
She was raised by wolves,
by intellectual, snooty wolves.

147
00:06:50,322 --> 00:06:53,224
I'm basically... I mean,
I'm her immediate family.

148
00:06:55,694 --> 00:06:57,629
You're not gonna check it?

149
00:06:57,696 --> 00:07:00,632
Nobody wants me treating their kid in this state.

150
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:03,935
The answering service
will refer whoever's on call.

151
00:07:05,838 --> 00:07:08,973
You know, I was right there.
I was at the door.

152
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:11,976
And you called, and... and I... I... 
I called because I got fired.

153
00:07:12,044 --> 00:07:14,979
No... I called because you're
my boyfriend, and I needed you.

154
00:07:15,047 --> 00:07:17,115
No, I'm not blaming you.
I'm not saying... 

155
00:07:17,182 --> 00:07:19,984
It's not your fault. It's my fault. I coulda stopped it.
You didn't know.

156
00:07:20,052 --> 00:07:22,086
I coulda walked... I could've saved her.
You don't know that either.

157
00:07:22,154 --> 00:07:24,122
If she had had the baby yesterday

158
00:07:24,189 --> 00:07:26,257
like she was supposed to...

159
00:07:26,325 --> 00:07:29,327
She doesn't do anything like she's supposed to.
Yeah, she's a real bitch that way.

160
00:07:29,395 --> 00:07:30,862
Just making a point.

161
00:07:30,929 --> 00:07:32,196
Which is?

162
00:07:32,264 --> 00:07:34,432
She's not to blame.
I'm not to blame.

163
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,401
You're not to blame.

164
00:07:36,468 --> 00:07:38,169
The only person who deserves blame

165
00:07:38,237 --> 00:07:40,538
is that woman who attacked
her and took her baby.

166
00:07:40,606 --> 00:07:42,740
You're not a superhero, Coop.

167
00:07:42,808 --> 00:07:45,743
No, I'm her family.

168
00:07:48,881 --> 00:07:51,683
Just take my hand and breathe.

169
00:07:58,123 --> 00:07:59,991
All right, everyone.

170
00:08:00,059 --> 00:08:02,193
We treat her like a multiple stab wound victim... 

171
00:08:02,261 --> 00:08:04,195
control the bleeding,
repair any organ damage,

172
00:08:04,263 --> 00:08:06,364
and we get out as fast as we can.

173
00:08:06,432 --> 00:08:10,101
Nai, scrub in. I need all the hands I can get.

174
00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:11,102
Nai.

175
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,137
I was going over to her house

176
00:08:13,205 --> 00:08:15,807
to tell her that I was leaving the practice.

177
00:08:15,874 --> 00:08:17,642
We've worked together

178
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,644
every single day for the past nine years... 

179
00:08:19,712 --> 00:08:21,245
She's gonna be okay.

180
00:08:21,313 --> 00:08:23,348
Are you sure?

181
00:08:23,415 --> 00:08:24,982
No.

182
00:08:33,264 --> 00:08:34,965
I.V. Tech to room 321.

183
00:08:35,033 --> 00:08:36,433
I.V. Tech to room 321.

184
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:37,901
Hey, did you hear anything?

185
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:39,636
No.
No.

186
00:08:45,743 --> 00:08:47,678
Violet wanted to have Katie committed.

187
00:08:47,745 --> 00:08:50,681
She knew. And I made fun of her.
We made fun of her.

188
00:08:50,748 --> 00:08:54,217
She knew something was wrong,
and I talked her out of it.
We talked her out of it.

189
00:08:54,285 --> 00:08:55,953
I should've... I should've just let... 

190
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,088
We. We. We. It is we, not you.

191
00:08:57,156 --> 00:08:59,390
We are in love with Violet.

192
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,726
We are the possible fathers of that baby.

193
00:09:01,794 --> 00:09:03,728
We are worried. We are scared.

194
00:09:03,796 --> 00:09:05,897
We ignored her concerns about Katie.

195
00:09:05,964 --> 00:09:10,267
We, not you, you smug, arrogant bastard.
But I'm the one she chose.

196
00:09:11,103 --> 00:09:12,904
Come on.

197
00:09:12,971 --> 00:09:16,274
All right. All right. I'm okay.

198
00:09:20,144 --> 00:09:23,647
How does something like this happen?

199
00:09:26,551 --> 00:09:28,385
I don't know.

200
00:09:30,655 --> 00:09:34,224
I don't know. I don't know.

201
00:09:56,647 --> 00:09:59,182
How's she doing?
Pressure's 60 over 40.

202
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,685
She's losing blood faster than
I can transfuse it in.

203
00:10:01,753 --> 00:10:04,054
Oh, God. What did she use, a hatchet?

204
00:10:04,122 --> 00:10:06,456
There. Got it.

205
00:10:06,524 --> 00:10:09,559
Addison, her pressure's not coming up.

206
00:10:09,627 --> 00:10:12,162
Damn it. She is bleeding from everywhere.

207
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,364
Nai, we're gonna have to extend the incision

208
00:10:14,432 --> 00:10:15,832
to make it vertical.

209
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,668
We gotta see what else
is bleeding and tie it off.

210
00:10:18,736 --> 00:10:20,303
Scalpel.
Addison.

211
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:22,539
What? They need answers.
Pete, Sheldon... 

212
00:10:22,607 --> 00:10:25,709
I... I need to be able to tell them something.
Addison!

213
00:10:25,777 --> 00:10:29,312
It's not the liver edge. It's
one of the mesenteric arteries.

214
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,548
All right. Clamp.

215
00:10:37,755 --> 00:10:39,656
We're all here, Violet, pulling for you.

216
00:10:39,724 --> 00:10:42,159
Just thought you should know.
She can't hear you, Dell.

217
00:10:42,226 --> 00:10:45,028
It's gonna be okay.
Everything's going to be okay.

218
00:10:45,096 --> 00:10:47,030
Dell, stop talking! I can't hear myself think.

219
00:10:47,098 --> 00:10:49,332
Addison...
He's just trying to help.

220
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,369
You just... you keep talking
to her, Dell. Go ahead.

221
00:10:54,305 --> 00:10:56,239
Um...

222
00:10:56,307 --> 00:10:58,275
I... I got Betsey back,

223
00:10:58,342 --> 00:11:00,944
which was maybe the
hardest thing I've done.

224
00:11:01,012 --> 00:11:04,714
Before Betsey, I didn't really have a family.

225
00:11:04,782 --> 00:11:07,317
You guys...

226
00:11:07,385 --> 00:11:10,387
You're my family.

227
00:11:10,454 --> 00:11:12,355
You're my family, Violet.

228
00:11:12,423 --> 00:11:15,358
So... I'm sitting here selfishly telling you...

229
00:11:15,426 --> 00:11:17,394
not to die.

230
00:11:19,664 --> 00:11:21,631
Okay?

231
00:11:24,902 --> 00:11:27,771
So I just got off the phone with Leo Brinkman.

232
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,273
He has to push back his start date?

233
00:11:30,341 --> 00:11:32,042
No, he got sued.

234
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:35,111
Yeah, apparently he likes
to touch his patients' feet...
Ooh!

235
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:36,947
For sexual reasons.
Great.

236
00:11:37,014 --> 00:11:39,216
Ooh. Shoulda gone into podiatry.
That's not funny.

237
00:11:39,283 --> 00:11:42,552
It's a little funny.
But it's awful. We're still short one.

238
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,688
D... does anybody know a good dermatologist?

239
00:11:44,755 --> 00:11:46,523
Well, I actually was thinking,

240
00:11:46,591 --> 00:11:48,525
maybe we could give his slot to Pete.

241
00:11:48,593 --> 00:11:50,794
I thought he was infectious disease.

242
00:11:50,862 --> 00:11:53,063
It's even better. He's got a great practice.

243
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,031
I like it. It's something we don't have,

244
00:11:55,099 --> 00:11:57,534
and he does critical care... that's two for one.
I know.

245
00:11:57,602 --> 00:11:59,536
But we can't... I mean, he can't work here

246
00:11:59,604 --> 00:12:02,639
'cause he's a patient, so we can't hire him.
Wit, wait.

247
00:12:02,707 --> 00:12:05,041
He goes to you once because I
make him, now he's off-limits?

248
00:12:05,109 --> 00:12:08,378
Actually, yes. I had a session
with him, so he's a patient.
Even if he says he's fine?

249
00:12:08,446 --> 00:12:10,614
He says he's fine.
I don't believe him.

250
00:12:10,681 --> 00:12:12,749
You don't believe him,

251
00:12:12,817 --> 00:12:15,318
otherwise you wouldn't have sent him to me.
Obviously he's not fine. His wife just died.

252
00:12:15,386 --> 00:12:17,554
Is he a good doctor?
He's a great doctor.

253
00:12:17,622 --> 00:12:19,923
Look, let's say Coop keels over
from a heart attack...
Ooh.

254
00:12:19,991 --> 00:12:21,324
And I give him C.P.R.

255
00:12:21,392 --> 00:12:23,827
Does that mean we have to fire
him because he's "my patient"?

256
00:12:23,895 --> 00:12:26,329
Um, Sam, could you not put
things like that out there.

257
00:12:26,397 --> 00:12:28,565
The universe has a perverse sense of humor.
We cannot hire him.

258
00:12:28,633 --> 00:12:30,567
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Is this an issue

259
00:12:30,635 --> 00:12:32,469
Because he's a patient
or there's a problem?

260
00:12:32,536 --> 00:12:35,105
Wait, you know Pete. 
Yeah, I... I... I do.

261
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:37,274
But if he can't suit up, we can't use him.

262
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:40,710
That's the issue. Okay, we need
a new partner...  a good doctor,

263
00:12:40,778 --> 00:12:42,779
and someone that we
get along with personally.

264
00:12:42,847 --> 00:12:44,881
Pete is both. Look, there is
something there, okay?

265
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:47,884
I mean, he sat with me,
he said all the right things,

266
00:12:47,952 --> 00:12:50,553
he knew all the right answers,
but there's something there.

267
00:12:50,621 --> 00:12:52,789
And until I know what it is,

268
00:12:52,857 --> 00:12:54,791
until he's ready to face what it is,

269
00:12:54,859 --> 00:12:57,527
trust me, you don't want him working here.

270
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,467
I hate this.

271
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:07,470
I hate it. I should... I should be doing something.

272
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:10,507
I should be out looking
for Katie or the baby or... 

273
00:13:10,574 --> 00:13:12,609
That's not your job.

274
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,846
What if she dies?

275
00:13:25,323 --> 00:13:27,557
I had a patient...

276
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:31,127
an old woman, a southern
woman, southern baptist.

277
00:13:31,195 --> 00:13:33,997
Strongest woman I ever met.

278
00:13:34,065 --> 00:13:37,233
And they were having a party
for her 90th birthday,

279
00:13:37,301 --> 00:13:39,202
only she was having chest pains,

280
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,204
so they took her to the hospital.

281
00:13:41,272 --> 00:13:44,207
A minivan T-boned her car on the way there.

282
00:13:44,275 --> 00:13:48,979
She lost her husband,
two sons, a grandchild.

283
00:13:49,046 --> 00:13:50,981
Her heart was fine.

284
00:13:51,048 --> 00:13:54,084
It was, uh, indigestion.

285
00:13:58,322 --> 00:14:01,624
Is there a point or are you
just spouting random crap?

286
00:14:01,692 --> 00:14:03,593
She came to me because everyone was worried

287
00:14:03,661 --> 00:14:06,629
that she was so devastated,
she wouldn't be able to go on.

288
00:14:06,697 --> 00:14:09,632
So I... I asked her. I asked her how she was coping.

289
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,336
And she said to me, "son, God will provide."

290
00:14:13,404 --> 00:14:15,338
That's it?

291
00:14:15,406 --> 00:14:17,540
She loses everything.
"God will provide"?

292
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:20,677
My point was... we should have a little faith.

293
00:14:20,745 --> 00:14:22,412
Do you?

294
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,681
Have faith?

295
00:14:24,749 --> 00:14:26,349
No.

296
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:28,251
But I'm pretending I do.

297
00:14:38,013 --> 00:14:40,014
Vascular clamp.

298
00:14:40,082 --> 00:14:41,549
Okay, bovie here.

299
00:14:41,617 --> 00:14:43,551
The bleeding's not slowing.

300
00:14:43,619 --> 00:14:45,519
I know. Every time I sew up one bleeder,

301
00:14:45,587 --> 00:14:47,521
another one appears.

302
00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:49,557
She's lost so much blood. I don't... 

303
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:52,426
I don't think she can take much more.

304
00:14:52,494 --> 00:14:54,495
Take out her uterus.

305
00:14:54,563 --> 00:14:56,264
A hysterectomy?

306
00:14:56,331 --> 00:14:58,132
To save her life.
No.

307
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,434
I can embolize the uterine arteries,

308
00:15:00,502 --> 00:15:03,004
block the blood supply and stop the bleeding.
She could die while you're
prepping her for the procedure.

309
00:15:03,071 --> 00:15:05,506
Do the hysterectomy.
What if the baby's gone for good, Nai?

310
00:15:05,574 --> 00:15:07,541
Violet wakes up, her baby's gone,

311
00:15:07,609 --> 00:15:09,710
and she can't have another child?
We'll find the baby.

312
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:11,746
Okay, life isn't always
that simple and easy, Nai.

313
00:15:11,813 --> 00:15:14,882
Babies don't always get found.

314
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,285
There isn't always a happy ending.
Yeah, things don't always have a happy ending,

315
00:15:17,352 --> 00:15:20,021
but she would be alive, Addison.
She would be alive. I'm embolizing.

316
00:15:20,088 --> 00:15:21,489
Whoa. What about Violet?

317
00:15:21,556 --> 00:15:24,025
What about what she would want?

318
00:15:24,092 --> 00:15:25,960
Hold these.

319
00:15:26,028 --> 00:15:28,262
Apply pressure to the uterus.
Don't move.

320
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:31,265
Dell, keep talking to her.

321
00:15:32,801 --> 00:15:34,735
I need a decision.
You save Violet.

322
00:15:34,803 --> 00:15:37,972
You do whatever you have to do,
but you save Violet.

323
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,309
Is... is it really and either/or?
If you save her uterus, she could still have kids.

324
00:15:41,376 --> 00:15:43,377
Yes.
But she could die.

325
00:15:43,445 --> 00:15:44,879
Yes. If you take out her uterus... 

326
00:15:44,946 --> 00:15:47,581
Violet lives, which is the goal here. Violet lives.

327
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:51,085
Stop talking over me. I'm trying to understand this.

328
00:15:51,153 --> 00:15:53,354
This is big. This... I need a decision. Pete?

329
00:15:53,422 --> 00:15:55,222
Save Violet.
Sheldon?

330
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:57,992
No, she chose me. He doesn't
have... he doesn't have a... 

331
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:01,495
I was going to agree with you. Save Violet.

332
00:16:02,831 --> 00:16:03,931
Cooper?

333
00:16:03,999 --> 00:16:06,000
Wait, no. What are you asking him for?

334
00:16:06,068 --> 00:16:09,437
Because he's... her Cooper.
To Violet, he's her Cooper.

335
00:16:09,504 --> 00:16:13,040
He's her best friend.
Cooper?

336
00:16:13,108 --> 00:16:15,810
Yeah, o... you know, we don't have time for this?

337
00:16:15,877 --> 00:16:19,347
Cooper! What would Violet want?

338
00:16:19,414 --> 00:16:22,083
She'd want you to try to save her uterus.

339
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:25,119
She'd want you to at least give her a shot

340
00:16:25,187 --> 00:16:26,754
at whatever she wants.

341
00:16:26,822 --> 00:16:29,023
No, no. No, no, you guys love her. I know her.

342
00:16:29,091 --> 00:16:32,259
I know every food she likes.
I know every thought

343
00:16:32,327 --> 00:16:35,262
she's ever had about a guy,
including the two of you.

344
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:38,733
I know... Violet. This is what she'd want.

345
00:16:42,571 --> 00:16:44,004
I'm gonna embolize.

346
00:16:44,072 --> 00:16:46,173
Addison...

347
00:16:46,241 --> 00:16:48,409
Damn it. You know what, Cooper?

348
00:16:48,477 --> 00:16:50,911
Hey, Pete... 
I am not on call!

349
00:16:50,979 --> 00:16:53,581
I'm gonna take someone's head off right now!

350
00:16:53,648 --> 00:16:55,816
I'm glad you came back.

351
00:16:55,884 --> 00:16:57,852
According to Sam, I didn't have a choice.

352
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:00,121
You know about the job?
I have my own practice.

353
00:17:00,188 --> 00:17:02,189
But in light
of what's happened,

354
00:17:02,257 --> 00:17:05,559
Yeah, working with friends... seems good... 

355
00:17:05,627 --> 00:17:07,528
Seemed good... but not to you.

356
00:17:07,596 --> 00:17:09,764
Well, no, no, I think working
with friends could be great,

357
00:17:09,831 --> 00:17:12,466
however... you can't figure me out.

358
00:17:12,534 --> 00:17:14,969
My emotions don't fit into one of your boxes,

359
00:17:15,036 --> 00:17:17,605
so you think there must be
something wrong with me.

360
00:17:17,672 --> 00:17:20,341
I don't have any boxes.
I'm just here to help you.

361
00:17:20,409 --> 00:17:21,876
And what we're doing now... 

362
00:17:21,943 --> 00:17:24,545
talking about the job instead of your wife's death... 

363
00:17:24,613 --> 00:17:26,247
Well, that's just another way

364
00:17:26,314 --> 00:17:29,049
of you avoiding dealing with something profound.
I told you about my wife.

365
00:17:29,117 --> 00:17:33,120
Yes, you told me what she died of and that it wasn't painful.
And I told you what I'm feeling... 

366
00:17:33,188 --> 00:17:35,790
Actually, you... you told me that you were feeling,

367
00:17:35,857 --> 00:17:38,125
not what you were feeling.

368
00:17:38,193 --> 00:17:41,195
You're holding things in, and when you do that,

369
00:17:41,263 --> 00:17:43,364
what happens is, eventually it festers

370
00:17:43,432 --> 00:17:45,733
And it explodes.

371
00:17:45,801 --> 00:17:47,802
It's like one of your infectious diseases.

372
00:17:47,869 --> 00:17:51,038
Sometimes you leave it alone.
You let the body heal itself.

373
00:17:51,106 --> 00:17:53,808
But your job is to figure out when to take action

374
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,843
in order to prevent further damage.

375
00:17:55,911 --> 00:17:57,812
Well, that's my job, too.

376
00:17:57,879 --> 00:18:00,848
And I look at you, and, uh,
I can't see leaving this alone.

377
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:03,851
I think we need to attack this for your own sake... 

378
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,887
Not for me or Sam, for you. Are you
married? Have you ever been married?

379
00:18:06,955 --> 00:18:09,824
I don't think that's the issue.
But it is. I... I'm sure you went to school,

380
00:18:09,891 --> 00:18:11,325
and you learned all about

381
00:18:11,393 --> 00:18:13,427
the brain and medications, people's feelings.

382
00:18:13,495 --> 00:18:15,963
But if you haven't been
married, if you haven't had

383
00:18:16,031 --> 00:18:18,132
a relationship like that, you're not qualified

384
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,402
to sit there and tell me anything about it.
I don't... I don't want to tell you anything.

385
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,003
I just want to listen. And judge.

386
00:18:23,071 --> 00:18:26,140
I'm not judging you. But you are.
You're judging my grief.

387
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,375
And you know what?

388
00:18:28,443 --> 00:18:31,879
I don't think you're qualified.

389
00:18:33,849 --> 00:18:36,350
Cooper Freedman. You paged me five times.

390
00:18:36,418 --> 00:18:39,353
Am I the only pediatrician in Los Angeles?

391
00:18:39,421 --> 00:18:40,921
I am not on call.

392
00:18:40,989 --> 00:18:43,824
You're the only pediatrician she wants.

393
00:18:46,228 --> 00:18:48,696
Call security now.

394
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,601
I heard about Violet on the news.

395
00:18:53,668 --> 00:18:55,436
They say she's alive.

396
00:18:55,504 --> 00:18:58,339
Is she alive?

397
00:18:58,406 --> 00:19:00,674
Oh, I had my baby.

398
00:19:00,742 --> 00:19:03,344
He's beautiful, isn't he?

399
00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:08,970
When Violet's better,

400
00:19:09,037 --> 00:19:11,472
I want her to see my baby.

401
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,341
She's gonna be so surprised.

402
00:19:13,409 --> 00:19:16,444
Everyone thought it was a girl, but I had a boy.

403
00:19:16,512 --> 00:19:19,914
And, um, is he healthy?
What did the doctor say?

404
00:19:19,982 --> 00:19:22,483
The doctor who delivered him?

405
00:19:22,551 --> 00:19:25,586
Um... he's fine. He's perfect.

406
00:19:25,654 --> 00:19:27,822
I just ask 'cause he... he looks a little pale.

407
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:31,526
Um, do you mind if I check him out?
Um...

408
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:36,230
Pete.

409
00:19:36,298 --> 00:19:38,199
Hey, Pete. Um, Katie had her baby.

410
00:19:38,267 --> 00:19:40,835
Isn't that great? Um...

411
00:19:40,903 --> 00:19:43,538
Does he look slightly pale to you?

412
00:19:43,605 --> 00:19:46,441
Yes, he does. Could indicate hemolysis.

413
00:19:46,508 --> 00:19:48,443
You should check him out.
Yeah.

414
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:51,913
What does that mean, hemolysis?
It's a breakdown of the red blood cells.

415
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,915
It happens in newborns.

416
00:19:53,982 --> 00:19:56,918
They used to die from it,
but it's very treatable now.

417
00:19:56,985 --> 00:20:01,189
Well, he... he cries if anyone
else touches him, so... 

418
00:20:01,256 --> 00:20:04,158
Well, Katie, Cooper just wants
to help. Look, I know you.

419
00:20:04,226 --> 00:20:06,694
I know how much you wanted
to have this baby, 

420
00:20:06,762 --> 00:20:10,465
how... how much you want it to be healthy.

421
00:20:10,532 --> 00:20:12,600
Katie, look at me.

422
00:20:12,668 --> 00:20:16,037
You need to let cooper
make sure. It's gonna be fine.

423
00:20:16,104 --> 00:20:19,207
Just... just have a little faith.

424
00:20:28,517 --> 00:20:30,151
Okay.

425
00:20:30,219 --> 00:20:32,286
You... be careful.
Hold his head.

426
00:20:32,354 --> 00:20:36,190
Hi there, little guy. Let's check you out.

427
00:20:36,258 --> 00:20:37,825
Katie.

428
00:20:37,893 --> 00:20:40,761
I got him. I got him.

429
00:20:40,829 --> 00:20:42,930
I got him. Okay.
No, that's my baby.

430
00:20:42,998 --> 00:20:45,233
No, that's my baby. You're taking my baby!
No.

431
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,268
No!
It's not your baby!

432
00:20:47,336 --> 00:20:50,071
You're stealing my baby! That's my baby!

433
00:20:50,138 --> 00:20:52,473
They're stealing my baby! No. No!

434
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,976
No.
I gotta stop Addison.

435
00:20:55,043 --> 00:20:57,979
Pete. Pete.

436
00:20:58,046 --> 00:20:59,280
Pete.

437
00:20:59,348 --> 00:21:01,482
Give me my baby, please.

438
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:04,819
Please give me my baby. Please.

439
00:21:06,355 --> 00:21:09,457
Inserting the catheter into the uterine artery.

440
00:21:09,525 --> 00:21:11,359
Addison, we have the baby.

441
00:21:11,426 --> 00:21:14,161
I was wrong. Stop the embolization.

442
00:21:14,229 --> 00:21:16,998
Just take out her uterus. Do
whatever you can to save her.
You have the baby?

443
00:21:17,065 --> 00:21:19,333
Katie showed up in the waiting room. Pete's got him.
Thank God.

444
00:21:19,401 --> 00:21:22,169
Addison, stop.
It's too late, Coop. I've already started.

445
00:21:22,237 --> 00:21:24,739
Is it working?
It's the baby. We need you, Coop.

446
00:21:24,806 --> 00:21:27,575
There was bruising on the
abdomen. I checked his crit.

447
00:21:27,643 --> 00:21:29,310
He's markedly anemic, going into shock.

448
00:21:29,378 --> 00:21:31,812
I think his spleen may be torn from being cut out.
Did you get an ultrasound?

449
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,482
There's free fluid in the abdomen.
He needs surgery now.

450
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,751
I'm gonna go look.
You... you can't just leave Violet.

451
00:21:36,818 --> 00:21:40,021
I'm almost done. You've done this before. You can close.
I've done this before in medical school.

452
00:21:40,088 --> 00:21:42,056
I'll be right back, Nai.
Cooper, can get the baby, Addison.

453
00:21:42,124 --> 00:21:44,692
Cooper is not a neonatal surgeon. I am.

454
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,761
I have a peds surgeon standing by.

455
00:21:46,828 --> 00:21:49,664
Not as good as I am. Clear an O.R.
Addison, stop.

456
00:21:49,731 --> 00:21:54,068
Let another doctor do this.
I can save them both, Nai.
I can save them both.

457
00:22:04,112 --> 00:22:06,013
Coop?

458
00:22:06,081 --> 00:22:08,316
If I had answered one of those pages...

459
00:22:08,383 --> 00:22:12,186
Oh, my God. How much time did I waste?

460
00:22:12,254 --> 00:22:14,589
How long was she waiting?

461
00:22:18,427 --> 00:22:20,328
Hey, how'd it go?

462
00:22:20,395 --> 00:22:22,496
Ooh. Not good?

463
00:22:22,564 --> 00:22:25,132
You know, you don't have to listen to Violet.
Well, maybe you should see her some more.

464
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,535
No, Sam. I'm done.
That woman...

465
00:22:27,603 --> 00:22:29,036
I'm sorry.

466
00:22:29,104 --> 00:22:31,172
I don't want to trash your new colleague.

467
00:22:31,239 --> 00:22:32,840
It's okay. I'm sorry.

468
00:22:32,908 --> 00:22:34,742
What are you doing, spying?

469
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:37,111
Uh, yeah.
Oh, my...

470
00:22:37,179 --> 00:22:40,581
I forgot how big Maya got.

471
00:22:40,649 --> 00:22:43,284
Oh, she's starting kindergarten this fall.

472
00:22:43,352 --> 00:22:44,785
I'm a lucky guy.

473
00:22:44,853 --> 00:22:46,220
Yeah.

474
00:22:46,288 --> 00:22:48,189
No. I mean it.

475
00:22:48,256 --> 00:22:50,658
I'm... a lucky guy.

476
00:22:50,726 --> 00:22:53,027
It's luck that Naomi was my lab partner,

477
00:22:53,095 --> 00:22:56,097
luck that she went out
with me for that first time,

478
00:22:56,164 --> 00:22:58,833
luck that she said yes when I proposed.

479
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,202
I'm just lucky that Maya's healthy

480
00:23:01,269 --> 00:23:03,304
And that we're happy

481
00:23:03,372 --> 00:23:06,474
and that we have this life...

482
00:23:08,844 --> 00:23:10,277
when you're... 

483
00:23:10,345 --> 00:23:12,146
Yeah.

484
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:19,620
I'm a lucky guy. It's just luck.

485
00:23:19,688 --> 00:23:22,256
She's the love of your life.

486
00:23:22,324 --> 00:23:24,759
That's not luck.

487
00:23:24,826 --> 00:23:27,762
That's... something else.

488
00:23:27,829 --> 00:23:30,898
Yeah, but you know what I'm trying to say.

489
00:23:30,966 --> 00:23:34,035
I'm gonna be fine, Sam. I am.

490
00:23:36,038 --> 00:23:37,938
Hey, pete.

491
00:23:38,006 --> 00:23:40,241
You're standing there so long.
You think she wouldn't see you?

492
00:23:40,308 --> 00:23:43,277
She wants you to come in. She
wants us to take turns reading.
All right.

493
00:23:43,345 --> 00:23:45,646
Do you have a patient?
No, no, I'm good.

494
00:23:45,714 --> 00:23:47,682
Okay. Uh, do you want to wait?

495
00:23:47,749 --> 00:23:50,117
No, we'll talk later.
I'm fine. All right.

496
00:23:50,185 --> 00:23:52,353
Hey, Maya.

497
00:23:52,421 --> 00:23:54,755
What's up with you?

498
00:24:01,063 --> 00:24:03,064
Okay, one more suture.

499
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,268
Pulse ox is dropping. Check her probe.

500
00:24:07,335 --> 00:24:09,070
The probe's fine.

501
00:24:09,137 --> 00:24:11,639
But she's tachy at 130. 140.

502
00:24:11,707 --> 00:24:13,974
What's going on? Is she... is she bleeding?
I don't know.

503
00:24:14,042 --> 00:24:15,743
She's in v-fib.

504
00:24:15,811 --> 00:24:18,679
Crash cart. Paddles charged to 200.

505
00:24:18,747 --> 00:24:21,248
Epi and lido. Let's go. Charge.

506
00:24:21,316 --> 00:24:23,884
Clear.

507
00:24:23,952 --> 00:24:26,721
Anything?
No pulse. She's still in fib.

508
00:24:26,788 --> 00:24:28,723
What the hell is going on?

509
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,224
I don't know.

510
00:24:30,292 --> 00:24:33,894
Unresponsive... V-fib... bleeding...

511
00:24:33,962 --> 00:24:37,465
electrolytes...

512
00:24:37,532 --> 00:24:39,767
turn her on her side.

513
00:24:39,835 --> 00:24:42,703
Give me a 60cc syringe and a spinal needle.

514
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,224
Got it.

515
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:05,493
Turn her on her back. Paddles. 360.

516
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,328
Clear.

517
00:25:11,133 --> 00:25:12,833
She's got a rhythm.

518
00:25:12,901 --> 00:25:14,301
And a pulse.

519
00:25:14,369 --> 00:25:17,972
Pulse ox is coming up. 86. 90. 92.

520
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:20,007
I did it.

521
00:25:20,075 --> 00:25:22,910
I did it.

522
00:25:22,978 --> 00:25:25,946
I did it.

523
00:25:26,014 --> 00:25:27,982
Dell, get addison.

524
00:25:28,049 --> 00:25:31,385
Get Addison now.

525
00:25:35,972 --> 00:25:36,539
So what have we got?

526
00:25:36,607 --> 00:25:38,074
Grade 4 splenic laceration.

527
00:25:38,142 --> 00:25:40,009
I'm trying to preserve the spleen.

528
00:25:40,777 --> 00:25:42,444
Vascular clamp.

529
00:25:42,512 --> 00:25:44,446
And the argon.

530
00:25:45,914 --> 00:25:48,316
Right there.

531
00:25:48,383 --> 00:25:50,217
Naomi says you need to come back, now.

532
00:25:50,285 --> 00:25:53,854
Now. Violet is bleeding
from her nose and mouth.

533
00:25:53,922 --> 00:25:55,823
It won't stop. She's not clotting?
Damn.

534
00:25:55,891 --> 00:25:58,326
Naomi said now.
I hear you, Dell.

535
00:25:58,393 --> 00:26:00,294
I can finish.

536
00:26:00,362 --> 00:26:01,395
Addison.

537
00:26:01,463 --> 00:26:04,332
Okay, let me just clamp this.
Got it.

538
00:26:04,399 --> 00:26:06,267
Cauterize any remaining bleeders, gently,

539
00:26:06,335 --> 00:26:09,270
but wait for me to come
back to set the vicryl mesh.

540
00:26:09,338 --> 00:26:12,940
Do not kill this baby while I am gone.

541
00:26:13,008 --> 00:26:14,108
Addison...

542
00:26:14,176 --> 00:26:15,643
Not now.

543
00:26:15,711 --> 00:26:17,111
What's happening?

544
00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:19,347
Not now.

545
00:26:19,414 --> 00:26:21,315
I know. I know.

546
00:26:21,383 --> 00:26:23,951
I should... try to have a little faith.

547
00:26:30,225 --> 00:26:32,293
What's her fibrinogen level?

548
00:26:32,361 --> 00:26:34,261
It's less than 100.

549
00:26:34,329 --> 00:26:36,997
She's not responding to platelets, F.F.P.

550
00:26:37,065 --> 00:26:39,600
Prepare antithrombin.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

551
00:26:39,668 --> 00:26:42,303
She's not clotting, and you want
to give her an anticoagulant?
Addison--

552
00:26:42,371 --> 00:26:43,804
With all the blood loss,

553
00:26:43,872 --> 00:26:45,539
Her coagulation system is working overtime.

554
00:26:45,607 --> 00:26:47,007
Hopefully with the anticoagulant,

555
00:26:47,075 --> 00:26:48,943
it will stop the cascade, and her own clotting

556
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:51,178
will start up again. Or it will kill her.

557
00:26:51,246 --> 00:26:53,314
It's her only shot.

558
00:26:53,382 --> 00:26:56,083
Prepare the antithrombin.
I have to get back to the baby.

559
00:26:56,151 --> 00:26:59,220
You can administer the A.T.3.
Addison, you better be right about this.

560
00:26:59,287 --> 00:27:01,589
If she dies... 
Do it, Nai.

561
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:20,307
We had a fight...

562
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:22,376
the night before she died.

563
00:27:22,444 --> 00:27:25,379
Well, we had a fight almost every night,

564
00:27:25,447 --> 00:27:28,916
but the night before she
died was our worst fight.

565
00:27:28,984 --> 00:27:30,985
She said things...

566
00:27:31,052 --> 00:27:37,091
we said things that you can't take back.

567
00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:39,393
I woke up the next morning.

568
00:27:39,461 --> 00:27:41,862
The alarm went off. I... her alarm went off.

569
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:44,064
I was still pissed.

570
00:27:44,132 --> 00:27:46,534
I turned it off...

571
00:27:46,601 --> 00:27:50,905
and she was just laying there ignoring me.

572
00:27:50,972 --> 00:27:52,907
And it pissed me off.

573
00:27:52,974 --> 00:27:55,910
I went to the bathroom.
I brushed my teeth.

574
00:27:55,977 --> 00:27:59,213
I was trying to get her to talk to me,

575
00:27:59,281 --> 00:28:02,149
and... she was just laying there.

576
00:28:02,217 --> 00:28:07,521
So I called her a bitch.

577
00:28:07,589 --> 00:28:09,557
I called her a bitch,

578
00:28:09,624 --> 00:28:12,860
and still, she just lay there, silent.

579
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:16,263
So I ripped the covers off...

580
00:28:16,331 --> 00:28:19,266
I ripped the covers off to
make her get out of bed

581
00:28:19,334 --> 00:28:21,268
and talk to me.

582
00:28:21,336 --> 00:28:23,871
She wouldn't talk to me...

583
00:28:23,939 --> 00:28:25,673
because she was dead.

584
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:29,143
Five minutes, I argued with my wife,

585
00:28:29,211 --> 00:28:32,513
and she was laying there, dead...

586
00:28:32,581 --> 00:28:36,016
and...

587
00:28:36,084 --> 00:28:38,152
I didn't know it.

588
00:28:41,823 --> 00:28:45,159
Well, you... you just said the
most important thing, Pete.

589
00:28:45,227 --> 00:28:47,161
You didn't know.

590
00:28:47,229 --> 00:28:49,497
Your anger, it... it didn't kill your wife.

591
00:28:49,564 --> 00:28:51,799
It didn't change anything.

592
00:28:51,867 --> 00:28:53,534
People fight.

593
00:28:53,602 --> 00:28:56,003
I hated my wife.

594
00:28:58,607 --> 00:29:00,674
See? That's the thing.

595
00:29:03,211 --> 00:29:06,947
I hated her.

596
00:29:07,015 --> 00:29:10,017
And I don't know what that says about me.

597
00:29:10,085 --> 00:29:12,920
I don't know what that says
about what kind of man I am,

598
00:29:12,988 --> 00:29:16,290
what kind of husband I am.

599
00:29:16,358 --> 00:29:18,292
Was.

600
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,294
But I hated my wife.

601
00:29:20,362 --> 00:29:22,296
So if you want to know why

602
00:29:22,364 --> 00:29:25,332
I didn't want to come and talk to you about it...

603
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,335
It's because my wife is dead,

604
00:29:28,403 --> 00:29:32,306
and all I can think is...

605
00:29:33,475 --> 00:29:35,543
I can breathe again.

606
00:29:49,558 --> 00:29:51,992
Did she die?

607
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:54,094
No.

608
00:29:54,162 --> 00:29:57,798
The bleeding, it stopped.

609
00:29:57,866 --> 00:29:59,466
She made it.

610
00:29:59,534 --> 00:30:02,002
Barely.

611
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:05,372
Good.

612
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,174
That's good.

613
00:30:13,114 --> 00:30:15,049
What about Kline?
You know, the cardiologist?

614
00:30:15,116 --> 00:30:17,051
He's got a really bad temper,

615
00:30:17,118 --> 00:30:19,086
and he sweats a lot. His palms...

616
00:30:19,154 --> 00:30:20,988
Yeah? Oh.
How about, uh, Moffet?

617
00:30:21,056 --> 00:30:23,190
Oh, I love Moffet. She's great.
Really?

618
00:30:23,258 --> 00:30:25,192
Yeah. Let me see.

619
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,995
I... s... slept with Moffet,

620
00:30:28,063 --> 00:30:31,131
and it ended badly, but...

621
00:30:31,199 --> 00:30:32,466
Okay.

622
00:30:32,534 --> 00:30:34,702
How can L.A. have so many doctors,

623
00:30:34,769 --> 00:30:38,105
and there is not one that we want to hire?
You should hire Pete.

624
00:30:38,173 --> 00:30:41,542
I'm sorry?
Did... you said... 

625
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:44,144
I... I know what I said, but we should hire Pete.
You cured him?

626
00:30:44,212 --> 00:30:46,413
I referred him to someone else.
You think he's ready?

627
00:30:46,481 --> 00:30:49,483
I think he's ready to start
doing the work on himself.

628
00:30:49,551 --> 00:30:52,653
And I think he was your friend
long before he was my patient.

629
00:30:52,721 --> 00:30:55,189
So, um, yeah, I think we should hire him.

630
00:30:55,256 --> 00:30:58,525
It'll be good... for the practice.

631
00:31:11,674 --> 00:31:13,241
How's the baby?

632
00:31:13,309 --> 00:31:15,076
I did my best.

633
00:31:15,144 --> 00:31:17,178
Time will tell. How's she?

634
00:31:17,246 --> 00:31:19,681
She's not waking up.

635
00:31:19,749 --> 00:31:21,716
You made the choice to do the embolization.

636
00:31:21,784 --> 00:31:24,185
You made the choice to give her the antithrombin.

637
00:31:24,253 --> 00:31:26,755
You left me alone in there.
You left me alone first.

638
00:31:26,822 --> 00:31:31,126
I did what I had to do. I did what I could to save... 
But you didn't have to operate on the baby.

639
00:31:31,193 --> 00:31:33,194
Charlotte had a peds surgeon right there.

640
00:31:33,262 --> 00:31:35,163
It's Violet. It's Violet's baby.

641
00:31:35,231 --> 00:31:37,966
They are my people.
They are my responsibility.

642
00:31:38,034 --> 00:31:40,035
Not yours, not anymore. You quit.

643
00:31:40,102 --> 00:31:43,004
You quit on me. So...
I have to take care of them.

644
00:31:43,072 --> 00:31:46,007
I have to do everything. Me.
Do you know what that's like?

645
00:31:46,075 --> 00:31:49,210
Do you know the weight
that is pressing down on me?

646
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:52,380
If she had died... if that baby had died...

647
00:31:52,448 --> 00:31:55,550
I know how to do one thing, Nai.

648
00:31:55,618 --> 00:31:58,820
Okay, I have failed at every
relationship I've ever had.

649
00:31:58,888 --> 00:32:00,822
I'm clearly not good at keeping friends

650
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,857
since I screwed up with you.

651
00:32:02,925 --> 00:32:04,859
But there's one thing I'm good at.

652
00:32:04,927 --> 00:32:07,328
I am good at surgery.
I am a brilliant surgeon.

653
00:32:07,396 --> 00:32:08,830
That's what I have.

654
00:32:08,898 --> 00:32:11,833
That's what I have to give
to my people, all right?

655
00:32:11,901 --> 00:32:13,835
And I was scared to death in there.

656
00:32:13,903 --> 00:32:16,638
The entire time, I was scared to death.

657
00:32:16,706 --> 00:32:18,640
So you don't get to lecture me.

658
00:32:18,708 --> 00:32:20,675
You don't get to fault me

659
00:32:20,743 --> 00:32:22,644
for not wanting to lose another friend.

660
00:32:22,712 --> 00:32:25,647
You walked out of the practice
and you left me alone.

661
00:32:25,715 --> 00:32:27,682
I'm exhausted, Nai.

662
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:30,852
And you left me alone.

663
00:32:45,434 --> 00:32:47,235
You're not alone.

664
00:32:49,004 --> 00:32:50,939
I did what I could.

665
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:56,911
If she doesn't wake up, if that baby... 

666
00:32:56,979 --> 00:33:00,782
That's... that's on me.

667
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:03,084
You are not alone.

668
00:33:03,152 --> 00:33:07,455
I would never leave you alone.

669
00:33:12,261 --> 00:33:15,263
You're not alone.

670
00:33:15,331 --> 00:33:16,765
You're not alone.

671
00:33:19,835 --> 00:33:22,570
You're not alone.

672
00:33:22,638 --> 00:33:24,372
You're not alone.

673
00:33:26,575 --> 00:33:28,910
You're not alone.

674
00:33:42,308 --> 00:33:44,943
He just keeps staring at her.

675
00:33:45,011 --> 00:33:46,845
How's the baby?

676
00:33:46,913 --> 00:33:50,215
Touch and go, like her.

677
00:33:51,283 --> 00:33:52,317
It's not right

678
00:33:52,385 --> 00:33:56,354
that he has to go through all this again.

679
00:34:48,057 --> 00:34:50,859
I don't know if I could do it.

680
00:34:50,926 --> 00:34:52,360
If God forbid...

681
00:34:52,428 --> 00:34:55,864
I'm not going anywhere.

682
00:35:05,474 --> 00:35:07,108
Look, about yesterday,

683
00:35:07,176 --> 00:35:08,610
the practice... 

684
00:35:08,678 --> 00:35:10,779
Oh, it's okay, Nai.

685
00:35:10,846 --> 00:35:13,581
People move on.

686
00:35:13,649 --> 00:35:17,018
It's what they do.

687
00:35:17,086 --> 00:35:19,421
We can do this.

688
00:35:24,393 --> 00:35:26,561
We're gonna be okay.

689
00:35:28,864 --> 00:35:31,266
All of us.

690
00:35:42,978 --> 00:35:45,113
How are they?

691
00:35:45,181 --> 00:35:46,948
I don't know.

692
00:35:50,453 --> 00:35:53,088
She was crying when I
came back from the O.R.

693
00:35:53,155 --> 00:35:55,223
I shouldn't have brought her,

694
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:57,792
put her through all this
waiting and worrying and...

695
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:00,929
I didn't have anywhere else to take her.

696
00:36:00,996 --> 00:36:05,533
What am I doing, Cooper?

697
00:36:05,601 --> 00:36:07,535
You know, I mean, I got her back,

698
00:36:07,603 --> 00:36:11,172
and... and... and it's
everything I wanted and...

699
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,841
Oh.

700
00:36:12,908 --> 00:36:14,376
What?

701
00:36:14,443 --> 00:36:17,345
That's not what I should
be worried about right now.

702
00:36:17,413 --> 00:36:18,880
Are you kidding me?

703
00:36:18,948 --> 00:36:21,850
It's exactly what you should
be worrying about right now.

704
00:36:21,917 --> 00:36:24,352
This little girl, man, this is your priority.

705
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,621
Yeah. Yeah.

706
00:36:26,689 --> 00:36:30,392
I mean, I am a 25-year-old single father.

707
00:36:30,459 --> 00:36:31,559
Yeah.

708
00:36:31,627 --> 00:36:33,595
You know, I'm responsible for her.

709
00:36:33,662 --> 00:36:36,564
I mean, how... how am I
gonna do this right

710
00:36:36,632 --> 00:36:38,967
without, you know,
without screwing her up?

711
00:36:39,034 --> 00:36:42,137
You just love her.

712
00:36:42,204 --> 00:36:44,672
And you ask for help.

713
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,741
You ask us for help.

714
00:36:46,809 --> 00:36:48,743
And take some time off,

715
00:36:48,811 --> 00:36:51,179
get... get her settled in,
do what you need to do.

716
00:36:51,247 --> 00:36:53,181
You know, we're gonna be here waiting

717
00:36:53,249 --> 00:36:55,183
when you come back.

718
00:36:55,251 --> 00:36:57,285
You guys would let me, uh, take time off?

719
00:36:57,353 --> 00:36:59,087
We're your family.

720
00:36:59,155 --> 00:37:00,989
You... you can't do it alone.

721
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:03,324
You know, you're just human, Dell.

722
00:37:03,392 --> 00:37:05,994
You know, you're not a superhero.

723
00:37:07,496 --> 00:37:10,498
All right? You just breathe, okay?

724
00:37:14,537 --> 00:37:16,471
Why don't you go, uh, see Violet?

725
00:37:16,539 --> 00:37:18,807
I'll... I got Betsey?
Yeah? You sure?

726
00:37:18,874 --> 00:37:20,742
Yeah. Okay, thanks.

727
00:37:27,983 --> 00:37:29,918
Why don't you go up there?

728
00:37:29,985 --> 00:37:31,586
Everyone else is there.

729
00:37:31,654 --> 00:37:33,488
No, I'm... I'm good here.

730
00:37:33,556 --> 00:37:36,858
She could wake up. She'd want you there.

731
00:37:36,926 --> 00:37:39,961
I'm good here.

732
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:03,918
Would you like to sit with him?

733
00:38:03,986 --> 00:38:07,422
Yeah. I'd... I'd like that.

734
00:38:11,627 --> 00:38:13,695
Thanks.

735
00:38:21,904 --> 00:38:23,705
What's his name?

736
00:38:25,741 --> 00:38:28,810
We have to ask Violet if she wakes up.

737
00:38:30,212 --> 00:38:31,980
When she wakes up.

738
00:38:32,047 --> 00:38:34,816
When she wakes up.

739
00:38:42,725 --> 00:38:44,392
No suit?

740
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,461
Oh, I thought I'd switch things up.

741
00:38:46,529 --> 00:38:48,196
You know, a fresh start.

742
00:38:48,264 --> 00:38:50,298
I'm thinking about changing specialties.
Oh.

743
00:38:50,366 --> 00:38:51,799
Alternative medicine... 

744
00:38:51,867 --> 00:38:54,269
different ways for the body to heal itself.

745
00:38:54,336 --> 00:38:57,505
So now that we're... just colleagues,

746
00:38:57,573 --> 00:38:59,607
can I still ask you how you are?

747
00:38:59,675 --> 00:39:01,543
Uh, better, I think.

748
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:03,144
I don't know.

749
00:39:03,212 --> 00:39:06,347
You know, you asked me
what kind of a man you are.

750
00:39:06,415 --> 00:39:09,851
Do you want to know what I think?

751
00:39:09,919 --> 00:39:12,453
I think you're the kind that
married the wrong person.

752
00:39:12,521 --> 00:39:14,422
Maybe she married the wrong person.

753
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:16,891
Maybe I'm not cut out
for all that... -love, marriage.

754
00:39:16,959 --> 00:39:19,427
Maybe I'm... it's just not in me.

755
00:39:19,495 --> 00:39:22,196
It is. You're a good man.

756
00:39:22,264 --> 00:39:24,999
And in time, eventually,
you'll, uh, you'll find someone.

757
00:39:25,067 --> 00:39:27,201
You will.

758
00:39:27,269 --> 00:39:29,671
You'll love someone.

759
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,174
I hope so.

760
00:39:48,857 --> 00:39:50,858
Violet.

761
00:39:53,095 --> 00:39:54,562
Where is he?

762
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:56,230
Violet.

763
00:39:56,298 --> 00:40:00,435
Where... where is he?

764
00:40:00,502 --> 00:40:02,937
Is he...

765
00:40:03,005 --> 00:40:05,106
He's here.

766
00:40:12,848 --> 00:40:14,549
Oh.

767
00:40:14,617 --> 00:40:16,184
Oh.

768
00:40:20,089 --> 00:40:23,257
He's so beautiful.

769
00:40:26,929 --> 00:40:30,331
I didn't expect him to be so beautiful.
