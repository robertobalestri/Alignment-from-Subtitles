1
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:09,940
I'm better.

2
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,280
Better?What,than me?

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,580
no.

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,240
Better--my wounds.I'm healed.I'm good.

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,930
I should probablyget back to my place.

6
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,620
There are dishes in my sink.

7
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,460
Well,that's whygod made cleaning ladies.

8
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:28,930
Don't go yet.

9
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:30,200
Relax.

10
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,790
Enjoy the luxury.

11
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,240
it's quiet again.

12
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,580
I hate this.

13
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:54,200
Charlotte is drivingery referral from st.Ambroseto her practice.

14
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,640
And to top it all off,I'm addicted to that coffeefrom the fourth floor.

15
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,050
Do you think they drugthe beans?

16
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,440
'Cse it's just...

17
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,780
good,too good.

18
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,420
You ever think about doingbillboards to compete?

19
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,250
Dell,no.

20
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,460
Pacific wellcaredoes billboards.

21
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,740
P--no.No,no billboards,all right?

22
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,450
It's only a matter of timebefore charlotte's patientssee beyondthe french press coffee

23
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,350
and find a seaof overrated doctorswith questionable ethics.

24
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:20,050
Uh,overrated doctor withquestionable ethics at 12:00.

25
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,310
You're looking good today,monty.

26
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:23,380
Dr.Lockhart.

27
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,620
Why are you here?

28
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,070
Unless--are you bringing coffee?

29
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,120
Actually,no.I'm hereto seethhe oer dr.Bennett.

30
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,700
-Naomi?
-What do you want with naomi?

31
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,000
Well,that'snone of your business.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,170
You'll be sure to tell herI stopped by?

33
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:34,210
No.

34
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:37,010
Yet something tells meyou'll remember.

35
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,420
This really isa nice office.

36
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,440
The wooden beams...

37
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,130
it's very"swiss family robinson.

38
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,770
"I like the beams.

39
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,520
I don't like him.

40
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,540
What do you think he wantswith naomi?

41
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,960
"Passion fruitpapaya black tea"?

42
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,220
I'm thirsty.

43
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,280
Boy,you're alsorelaxed and smiley.

44
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,790
And your shoulders--I mean,usually they're...

45
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,040
like this...

46
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,940
but now they're like that.

47
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,090
You're being ridiculous.

48
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,260
you had sex.

49
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:22,970
You had sex.

50
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:23,990
I don't reallywant to talk about it.

51
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,390
I-I just...

52
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,530
I want to savor it.

53
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,800
Who's the lucky guy?

54
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,510
I just want to savor it.

55
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,100
Violet had sex.

56
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,770
Six weeks on the road?

57
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,740
That's a lot of driving,man.You must miss home.

58
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:52,190
A little,but I don't mindbeing in the car.

59
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,430
I get to read a lot.

60
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,580
I read a lot as a kid,too,and my friendsthought I was weird,

61
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:59,270
and I didn't care,'cause,you know,it was cool.

62
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,190
We're on the road.

63
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,940
I don't really have to worryabout friends.

64
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:06,860
Have you beentaking care of yourself,checkingyour blood sugar level?

65
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,370
Before I eat,but sometimes I feel dizzy.

66
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,050
Okay,let's see what's going oyou know the drill.

67
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,380
You're reading"three musketeers," huh?You like the epics?

68
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:25,970
I like that world,and I like that no onecan tear them apart.

69
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:30,700
It's 210,which is kinda high,porter.

70
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,810
Let's take a lookat that pump.

71
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,660
Giving you any trouble?

72
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,220
It gets clogged,but my dad fixes it.

73
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,610
What about your mom?

74
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,500
She diedwhen I was a baby.

75
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,320
It's just me and dad.

76
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:45,530
Let's see.

77
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,080
-Ouch.
-Sorry.

78
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,750
Think you havea little infectionnear the insertion point.

79
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,620
It doesn't look like you've beenkeeping that really clean.

80
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,140
I've been trying,but...

81
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,370
but what?

82
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,580
Hey,it's okay.You can tell me.

83
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,040
We've been sleepingin the car.

84
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,470
Tell me whatI'm checking for here.

85
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,840
I'm not in med school yet.

86
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,380
It never hurtsto get ahead.

87
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:14,520
I'm checking your ovariesfor masses.

88
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,220
Everything's great.

89
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,040
good.

90
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,100
I was a little nervous.

91
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,540
Do you have reason to be?

92
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,810
I've hadmore sexual partne lately.

93
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:26,790
Okay.

94
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,400
More than five?

95
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,550
More than ten?

96
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:34,030
11...

97
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:34,910
this month.

98
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,820
That is a lot.

99
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,080
I wasn't going to tell you.

100
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,950
What's going on?

101
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,690
Promise you won't judge me?

102
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,760
I'm saving upto go to med school.

103
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,350
I've been working part-timeas a call girl.

108
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,250
It's not as badas it sounds.

109
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,000
It's insane.

110
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,230
I have to pay for schoolsomehow.

111
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,220
Take out a loan.

112
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,300
And be in debt till I'm 50?

113
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,300
carley.

114
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:11,460
The money's amazing,and the guysare really nice.

115
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,260
Last weekend,one ofthe girls met this guy

116
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,530
who flew a couple of usout to dubayy for a party,

117
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,190
and if I told youhow much we made--

118
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:20,980
I would still be concernedabout you.

119
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,100
I'm fine.

120
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,640
Except for one thing,which is kind of why I came.

121
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,360
Some of the girlsthink they might havepicked up somethingfrom the party.

122
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,050
An S.T.D.?

123
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:32,810
And they were hopingyou could see them.

124
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,260
they didn't want to usestudent health.

125
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,790
They didn't want wordto get out.

126
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,300
I don't like this,carley.

127
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,650
Please.

128
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,110
I'M...

129
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,580
gonna give you my card.

130
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,350
I'm gonna write downmy personal cell.

131
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,190
Thank you.

132
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,680
That means a lot.

133
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,180
I'm worried about you.

134
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:08,490
So porter's bloosugaris unstable,um,

135
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:12,600
and he has an infectionfrom not cleaninghis cannula.

136
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,890
I'm gonna start himon antibiotics,but he does needa new insulin pump.

137
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,520
Oh,how longwill that take?

138
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,590
I need to order a new one,so three days,maybe four.

139
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,720
I can't wait.I have to be inoregon by the end of the week.

140
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,710
I have a job interview.

141
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:26,720
Without a working pump,his sugar level isgonna continue to fluctuate.

142
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,640
Well,I'll be careful.

143
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:34,630
No,I'm sure you will,but being on the road presentsa unique set of circumstancesfor a diabetic 12 year old.

144
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,820
Porter told me aboutyour sleeping arrangements.

145
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:44,100
You think I-I want my kidsleeping in a car?

146
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:47,130
You know,it was hard enoughlosing my job and our house,

147
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:51,050
and now I gotta livewith the shameof not providing for my son.

148
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,120
I know it must be difficult.

149
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,080
I need this job,dr.Freedman.

150
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,000
If you don't stop,your son could die.

151
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,200
It's not a choice,frank.

152
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,710
You have to give mea couple of days.

153
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,700
I've known carleyfor almost a year.

154
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,370
I mean,she's a nice girlworking her ass offto get into medical school.

155
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,430
I-I just--I still can't believeshe's doing this.

156
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,780
Well,she grew upwith nothing.

157
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,740
Now she makes more moneyin a monththan her parents doin a year.

158
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,470
The worst partis that she doesn't seemto be bothered by it.

159
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,890
Well,she's repressing emotion.

160
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:25,030
It's a defense mechanism to helpher cope with what she's doing.

161
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:27,700
Most prostituteshave low self-esteem.

162
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,350
Many of 'em were victimsof sexual abuse.

163
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:32,150
I've met a few call girlsin my day.

164
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,350
And we would discusswhy they got into the trade,

165
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:38,000
and it's not because they weretouched inappropriatelyor forced to have sex.

166
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,660
Because they don't want youto believe itbecause it kills the fantasy.

167
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,520
Don't kid yourself.These girls are victims.

168
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,200
Try telling that to carley.

169
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,590
Hey,pete.You ever pay for sex?

170
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,860
Don't have to.

171
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,040
What's up with him?

172
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,840
I don't ow.

173
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:57,420
I gotta get back to work.

174
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,370
So...

175
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,730
you gonnatell us what he wanted?

176
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,210
-Who?
-Wyatt lockhart.

177
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:10,450
Oh,I haven't been downto talk to him yet.

178
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,360
All right,fine.

179
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:16,170
I will go.

180
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,370
Claudia jenkins,35-year-old woman,

181
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,530
stage ii adenocarcinomaof the lungs.

182
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:25,850
Now usually a patientwith that type of cancerdies within a year.

183
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:28,860
This x-ray was takenwhen I first met her.

184
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,950
This was takenjust last week.

185
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,110
Oh,my god.That's amazing.

186
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:38,090
That's full remission,thanks tomy aggressive combinationof chemoand radiation protocols.

187
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:41,200
So you asked me down herejust to show offone of your miracles?

188
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,530
No.No,no.

189
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:45,270
I brought youdown here because...

190
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:49,820
my miraclewants to get pregnant.

191
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,130
what's withthe elevator music?

192
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,480
I'm on hold.

193
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,570
You know what I'd doif I ever met the guythat picks these songs?

194
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:01,430
What's wrong with you?

195
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,790
The diabetic kidI saw this morning?

196
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,080
His insulin pump isregistered to someone else.

197
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,430
Okay,you can't reuse pumps.

198
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,990
I know,so I usedthe serial number to trackthe doctor that installed it.

199
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,530
That's who I'm holding for.

200
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:15,590
But this kid's dad--something was off,and they'reliving out of their car.

201
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,230
You think they could'vestolen an insulin pump?

202
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,630
Well,times are tough.

203
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,520
hello?

204
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,210
Yes,hi.

205
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:27,220
I gave your secretarythe serial number of...

206
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,000
right.

207
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,900
Oh,that's awful.

208
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,870
No,I...

209
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,890
I'm gonna call you back.

210
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,790
What'd he say?

211
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:41,940
The kid who the pumpis registered to...

212
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,490
he was kidnapped.

213
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,140
It's gotta bethe same kid.

214
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,820
Same age,same height,same blood type.

215
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,640
Well,we gotta callthe police then,let them know we're dealingwith a kidnapping.

216
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,820
I want to talk to him first.

217
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,730
Coop,this kid could bein serious danger.

218
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,770
We don't even knowif frank's the real father.

219
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:04,570
He could be anyone.

220
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,400
I saw them together.Porter trusted this guy.

221
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,670
And if frankwas some stranger,he wouldn't have let meexamine porter by myself,

222
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,210
and the kid could have told meto call the cops.

223
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,200
What if you're wrong?

224
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,780
Frankgets spooked,he takes off.

225
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,130
This could be your only chanceto save this kid.

226
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:20,060
Why are you giving mea patient

227
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:24,380
when theest of your practicehas done everythingthey can possibly doto undermine us upstairs?

228
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,420
He's not.

229
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,690
Perhaps dr.Lockhartsn'twa clear.

230
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,650
Claudia jenkinsis our patient.

231
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,280
She's part ofan ongoing clinical study.

232
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,190
She's continuing cancertreatments.

233
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,690
You'd be consulting.

234
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,780
you want meto work for you?

235
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:39,830
I have work upstairs.

236
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:43,790
tell you what,if your patientwants fertility treatments,have her give me a call.

237
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:46,870
No one who's survivedthis type of cancerhas ever been ableto conceive.

238
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,000
Thought you likeda challenge.

239
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,240
With your help,I can get her pregnant.

240
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,820
We can get her pregnant.

241
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:07,370
is this you?

242
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,690
Yes.

243
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,290
I write,too.

244
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:14,870
Well,short stories,mosy,but,um,

245
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:22,350
I would love to hearhow you got started,if you ever hadsome time.

246
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,980
You'll call me?

247
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,960
Um,the,um,kidnapped kidis coming back in.

248
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,100
Oh,okay.

249
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,910
Is it college day?

250
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,030
I loved college.

251
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:40,900
Who are they here to see?

252
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,070
They're here to see addison.

253
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:45,120
Referrals fromher coed call girl.

254
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,400
They don't look likecall girls to me.

255
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,850
A room full of call girls--I've had dreams like this.

256
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,640
Are you sucking inyour gut?

257
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,300
No,no.

258
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,610
hey,guys.

259
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:00,290
What's with the call girls?

260
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,190
I do this for a living.

261
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,540
What are you doing here?

262
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,630
I had...

263
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,880
rehabdown the street.

264
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,880
I thought I'd come by,see if you had time for coffee,

265
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,990
but,uh,it looks likeyou're booked.

266
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,950
Seeing hookersa subspecialty now?

267
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,350
You'it.Re seeingmore prostitutes?

268
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,220
I'm seeing women.

269
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,330
Of the night.

270
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:24,670
Wait,you have a problemwith this?

271
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,700
Yeah,I do.

272
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:29,000
Look,I amall for free choice,but these girls are daged.

273
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,370
They can't make good choices.

274
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,690
So,yeah,I think that if youonly treat them physically,

275
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,670
then you're justperpetuating their problem.

276
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,670
Is this really whatour practice is coming to?

277
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,920
Well,what should it be?

278
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,490
Just another high-endwestside cliniccatering toan overly exclusive clientele?

279
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,860
I mean,is that what we are?

280
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,830
This isn't exactlyhollywood boulevard.

281
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,840
And you thinkthat makes a difference?

282
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,150
You want to hearthe statistics and linksbetween prostitution and drugs,

283
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,930
prostitution and violent crime?

284
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:58,710
I'm not condoningtheir behavior,but they're not streetwalkers.

285
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,750
And you think just becausethey're in school every day

286
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,620
doesn't mean it's gonna leaddown the same path?

287
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,870
They may think it's temporary,but you want to lay oddson

288
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:08,610
how many are still doing itfive years from now?

289
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,510
I...

290
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:15,430
probably have patients.

291
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,950
I have patients,too.

292
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:22,840
Well,I better let youget back to them.

293
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,180
Hold the door.

294
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:33,760
Sorry.

295
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,640
I--no,I...

296
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,860
right.

297
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,970
Good idea.I was just--

298
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,060
I should...

299
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,280
hello,doctor.

300
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,860
Well,I,uh...

301
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,380
you look surprisedto see me.

302
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,290
I just didn't expect youtill tonight.

303
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:16,170
Oh,I have some chartsto pick up,and I missed you.

304
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,360
I'm glad you're back.

305
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,670
I got your call.You said it's urgent.

306
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,800
Yeah,there'sa couple more testsI want to run on porter.

307
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,490
Um,it'll just takea minute,though.

308
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:31,340
You can---you can stay here.

309
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,970
Oh,hey,one second,porter.

310
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,610
Dell,can you keep an eyeon the father out there,

311
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,030

312
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,840
-Yeah,no problem.
-Thanks.

313
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,080
Here.Have a seat,buddy.

314
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,370
What kind of tests?

315
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:48,300
Is sometng wrong?

316
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,120
No,no.I just--I want to talk to you,porter.

317
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,730
I-I...

318
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,180
I want to help you.

319
00:14:53,180 --> 00:15:00,170
Um,your insulin pumpis registered to a kidnamed evan dawson.

320
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:01,740
So?

321
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,130
So I think that's you.

322
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:05,850
Is it you?You okay?

323
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,990
Is he hurting you?

324
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,800
Did he force youto leave your mother?

325
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,320
I want to help y,evan.

326
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,080
I'm gonna help you.

327
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:22,810
But I need youto level with me.

328
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:31,700
He was nice at first,told me we'd do all kindsof fun things together.

329
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,680
But then he startedhitting me.

330
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,620
I'm not gonna let thathappen again.

331
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,290
I promise you.We are keeping an eye onthat man out there right now.

332
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:41,900
No,not him.

333
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,140
Not my father.

334
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,170
My mom's boyfriend ted.

335
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:50,700
He moved in six months aftershe kicked my dad out.

336
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:55,400
When my mom wasn't around,ted would get angry.

337
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,050
Did you tell your mom?

338
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:59,440
She would ask him about it,but...

339
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,730
he would sayit wasn't true.

340
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,820
But my dad believed me.

341
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:10,160
He was the only onewho did.

342
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,840
evan.

343
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,820
I need help in here

344
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,640
-what?
-I need an amp of d50.

345
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,300
Okay,I'm on it.

346
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,110
What's wrong with him?

347
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,950
His blood sugar's tanking.He's having a seizure.

348
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,000
All right.Hold him steady.

349
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,140
Hold him steady.

350
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:33,680
What are you doing to him?

351
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,820
Trying to save his life.

352
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,460
Please don't let him die.

353
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,930
He's all I have.

354
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,110
Is he gonna be all right?

355
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,560
I don't know.

356
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:46,760
Please.

357
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,950
Look,he was finefive hours ago.

358
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,300
I checked his pump.

359
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:49,940
I checked it.

360
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,910
It--right now,my--my priorityis evan.

361
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,400
You understand?

362
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,440
Do not moveuntil I get back.

363
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,580
We're gonna go on my count.

364
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:00,890
One,two,three.

365
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,260
Hey,is that kid okay?

366
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:07,880
I hope so.

367
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,010
He's at the,uh,the hospitalwith cooper right now.

368
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,010
Good.

369
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,850
You all donewith your prostitutes?

370
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:15,260
First,kevin's moralistic joe,now you?

371
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,830
Those women sell themselves.

372
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:19,340
They make people feel likeall women are for sale.

373
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,260
They need a doctor.

374
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,160
I am a doctor.

375
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,000
What did wyatt want?

376
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,790
Oh,um,he wanted meto consulton one of his cancer patientswho wants to get pregnant.

377
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,600
Consult?For him?

378
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,800
You're not actually consideringworking with this guy,

379
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,290
workingfor charlotte's practice?

380
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:34,340
I said I'd think about it.

381
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,740
They're trying to drive usout of business,naomi.

382
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,340
Look,all I know is that thiswoman was supposed to be dead,

383
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,500
and she's in remission.

384
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,790
She has a chance to have a baby,and if I can help her--

385
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:45,050
wyatt is not abouthelping people,nai.

386
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:47,130
He's about helping wyatt.

387
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,840
I'll see.

388
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:51,110
-Naomi.
-What?

389
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:54,490
I-I said thatI would thinabout it.

390
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,010
What are you doing,addison?

391
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:08,100
What are youtalking about?

392
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,620
I went by my houseto straighten things up.

393
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,320
They were straight.

394
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,000
Surprise.

395
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,090
I wanted to surprise you.

396
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,650
I thought about youworrying about things,

397
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:21,310
so I sent my housekeeper overto tidy things up.

398
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:24,120
I-I don't need youpaying for me.

399
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,810
No.No,of course not.

400
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:28,530
My place isn't disgustingand pathetic.

401
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,090
-No,I wasn't saying that--
-I live in the valley.

402
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:32,990
It's not the slums.

403
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,240
kevin--oh.

404
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,190
dr.Montgomery.

405
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,530
Carley?

406
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,980
Are you okay?

407
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,390
But--no,no,no,don't worry.

408
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:54,250
I'm--I'm glad you called.

409
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,140
Yeah,don't--that's fine.

410
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:00,940
Uh,um,I can come,and I'llbe there as fast as I can.

411
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,390
Bye.

412
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:04,060
Everything okay?

413
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,630
It's one of the call girls,the one that was my patient.

414
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:08,170
A guy hit her.

415
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,050
And she's calling you?

416
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:10,600
She's afraid of the police.

417
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:11,800
You're gonna go down there?

418
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,780
-No,look,you don't know whatyou could be wking into.
-Don't be dramatic!

419
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,430
Addison,this is what I do.

420
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,880
You don't know this world.

421
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,250
It can be dark and ugly.

422
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,440
You are makingway too much out of this.

423
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,700
Hey,you didn't know she wasa call girl until today.

424
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,080
Look,I understandyou want to help her,

425
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,740
maybe you think you caneven save her.

426
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,170
But you're dabbling in a worldyou know nothing about,

427
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,840
-and I'm not letting yougo down there alone.
-Whoa,you're not gonna let me?

428
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,780
-I'm coming with you!
-Since when don't you let me do anything?

429
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:35,280
All right,I am not aboutto walk in therewith her worst nightmare.

430
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm goingand I'm going alone.

431
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,570
So why am I here again?

432
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:53,390
Because kevin made mefeel stupid for going alone.

433
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:54,280
Kevin's a cop.

434
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,140
If he says it's dangerous,

435
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,600
don't you think he's a littlebetter equipped to protect youthan I am?

436
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,970
You'll be fine.

437
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:01,840
So all of those girls,all of 'em,they're...

438
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,650
they're call girls?

439
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,710
What is it with everyone?

440
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:04,980
They're...

441
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,290
college studentsearning moneyin an inappropriate way.

442
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,860
They're just kidsthey're students.

443
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:13,760
Of course,most students don't getbeat up by their johns.

444
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,520
So what are younot telling me?

445
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,200
What?

446
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,980
We've been sitting herein silence for 20 minutes.

447
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,770
Oh,I'm--I'm sorry.

448
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,960
I was just,uh...

449
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,880
at is wrong?

450
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,980
You look likeyou're about to throw yourselfoff the sideof this building.

451
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,570
No,I-I-I--it's nothing.

452
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:39,410
I--just a rough day at work,that's all.

453
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:40,630
Okay.

454
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,530
Okay?

455
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:45,380
If you don't want to talkabout whatever it is,I'm not goa push.

456
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,220
We're okay,right?

457
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:54,810
Yes,we are.

458
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:56,180
I missed you.

459
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,880
Good.

460
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,320
Because I missed you.

461
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,020
how is he?

462
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,190
He's stable for now.

463
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,220
The pump failed.

464
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,330
It releaseda sky-high dose of insulin.

465
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:20,460
It's been replaced,and he is responding well.

466
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,560
This is my fault.

467
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,820
I-I tried to look after it,I tried to keep it clean,

468
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,560
but it's j hart soD.

469
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,210
Okay,have a seat.

470
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:33,560
why'd you run?Why didn't yougo to the police?

471
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,500
Do you know how hard it isto prove abuse,

472
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,700
or for a father to get custodyof his child?

473
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,940
I wasn'tjust gonna sit aroundand waitfor some legal procedure

474
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,630
while my son was getting hit.

475
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,810
You need to turn yourself in.

476
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:47,620
And then what,hmm?

477
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,760
Who's gonna protect my sonwhen I'm in jail?

478
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,910
You don't knowwhat it's like to knowthat your son is being hurt

479
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,780
and there's nothingyou can do to stop it.

480
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,820
You--you cannot keepthis child on the run.

481
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,200
Well,I'm nottaking him back.

482
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,600
Is there a problem here?

483
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,380
Nothing I can't handle.

484
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:09,670
I'm gonnago see my boy now.

485
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,590
Carley?

486
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,430
dr.Montgomery?

487
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:24,570
Carley,what happened?

488
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,340
That's dr.Bennett.We work together.

489
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:32,160
Did your clientdo this to you?

490
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,960
Yes.

491
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,990
It hurts.

492
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,290
carley,you should'vecalled 9-1-1.

493
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:38,480
I thought we were talking abouta couple of bruises here.

494
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,300
I didn't want to explain.

495
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,850
I didn't want to get in trouble.

496
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,540
I-I had your number.

497
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,710

531
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,610
That's not fair.

He listened to me.

533
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,860
He wasthe only one who listened to me.

534
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:19,800
I'm all he has.

535
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,640
He's all i have.

536
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,460
So can't you just...

537
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,070
let us go?

538
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,410
What a surprise.

539
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,530
Claudia jenkins,dr.Naomi bennett.

540
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:42,010
He has sung your praises.

541
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,880
Yeah,I figuredyou two should meet.

542
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,080
Uh,well,why don't youcome back to my office,

543
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,170
and we'll have a talk?

544
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:48,840
If you have time,that would be great.

545
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,930
Yeah,yeah.

546
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:51,030
Great.

547
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:51,840
Uh,you know what?

548
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,960
You twoalready know each other.

549
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,930
I'd like to talkto claudia alone.

550
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:56,790
Whatever you need.

551
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,680
See you.

552
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,650
I can't believe I'm here.

553
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:05,310
I mean,that I've actuallybeen well enough long enough

554
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:08,920
to be sitting acrossfrom a doctorhaving a discussionabout getting pregnant.

555
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,960
Well,your recovery has...

556
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,820
been astounding.

557
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,180
Thanks to wyatt.

558
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,760
Every other doctor I went tosaid there was no treatment.

559
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,920
Sometimes I think he cured meby his sheer will.

560
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:22,330
He would not let me give up,and I wanted to give up.

561
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:24,200
He's tough.

562
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:27,940
You know,I thinkhe might have actually scaredthe cancer away.

563
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:34,050
your body has been throughso much.

564
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:37,310
And--and fertility treatmentspost-cancer...

565
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,670
it's a lot on the body.

566
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,170
Are you sure you want togo through with all that?

567
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:41,360
I mean,there--there areother options.

568
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,900
There's adoptionor--or surrogacy.

569
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:48,250
I want to have a baby myself.

570
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:52,220
My body attacked me,and I fought back and I won.

571
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,480
I can do this.

572
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,110
I want my life back.I...

573
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:58,460
I want my dreams back.

574
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,730
Do you know what I mean?

575
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,620
I'm here as a patient.I need your professional advice.

576
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,330
Okay.

577
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:16,970
Well,leave the door open so...

578
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:18,940
oh,door.Good.

579
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:28,950
your time will start...

580
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,790
now.

581
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,580
I had dinnerwith meg last night.

582
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,700
It was unbearable.

583
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,530
Why was that?

584
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:37,770
She knows me.She reads me.

585
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:40,410
She kept asking mewhat was wrong.

586
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:41,040
-Well,what did you tell her?
-That nothing was wrong.

587
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,420
And you think you should'vetold her something else?

588
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,940
I don't know.What do youthink I should've told her?

589
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,090
What do you thinkyou should've told her?

590
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:47,890
Are you gonna answerall my questions with questions?

591
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:48,980
That's what therapists do.

592
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,820
Then stop being my therapist.

593
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,050
Be my friend.

594
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,730
Fine.

595
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,800
I think that...

596
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,510
telling about cheatingonly makes the cheaterfeel better.

597
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:07,770
I think it would bea cruel thing to put on meg

598
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:10,040
if you plan to move forwardwith her.

599
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,930
Nothing goodcould come of it.

600
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:15,270
I-if you plan onmoving forward with meg,then you,

601
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:18,210
as the cheaterneed to...

602
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:20,850
suffer in silencefor your crime.

603
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:24,120
Live with the guiltand move on.

604
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,790
That was an ambush.

605
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,020
But she's lovely,isn't she?

606
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,380
Addison was right about you.

607
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,540
Tell me you weren't moved.

608
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,850
Why me?Why me?

609
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:36,550
There are hundreds offertility doctors in this city.

610
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:37,740
Why me?

611
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:41,000
Because I did my research,and you're the best.

612
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,110
And if claudia jenkins wantsa chance at getting pregnant,

613
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,490
she's gonna need the best.

614
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:45,520
And I'm supposed to believethat

615
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,430
this is motivatedpurely out of compassionfor your patientand not for your ownpersonal gain?

616
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:51,150
I like to win.

617
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,310
So what?

618
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:54,790
I-I like to find new waysto cure things.

619
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:57,140
I'm changing the waywe cure cancer.

620
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,640
That's not ego.

621
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,970
That's the truth.

622
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:02,790
Tell me you don't want to bea part of that.

623
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:22,650
How are you feeling?

624
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:24,340
Like I got beat up.

625
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,920
You have to report this,carley.

626
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,620
Are you crazy?

627
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:29,140
So what--what,this guy,he just gets away with it?

628
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,100
I can't risk it.

629
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,990
Tell me that you're notgonna do this anymore.

630
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:34,560
How longwill the bruises last?

631
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,950
You need to find another wayto make money.

632
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:37,990
It's one bad incident.

633
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:39,240
You were lucky last night.

634
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,260
He could've killed you.

635
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,500
In a few months,I'll graduate debt free.

636
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,710
In another year,I'll be ableto pay for med school.

637
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:46,770
That's not worth your life.

638
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:48,520
I'm doing it so I can bea doctor like you.

639
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,350
Find a different wayto get there.

640
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:53,220
Doing what,working forminimum wages and tips

641
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:56,950
and dating guyswho want to sleep with me because they buy me a steak?

642
00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:01,720
At least this way,I get paid what I'm worthand I call the shots.

643
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,510
how many part-time jobsdid you have to pay for school?

644
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:08,860
How many loansdid you have to pay back?

645
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,240
I wouldn't have donewhat you're doing.

646
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,160
If you haven't struggled,

647
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,020
if you don't know what it's liketo come from nothing,

648
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,450
then you can't understand.

649
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:19,830
What would your parents sayif they knew?

650
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,120
You can't call them.

651
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,280
I may notbe in med school yet,

652
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,710
but I know all aboutdoctor-patient privilege.

653
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,860
You're right.

654
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,970
I can'T.

655
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:32,220
But I am tpted.

656
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,860
I know you're trying to help,dr.Montgomery,

657
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,310
but stay out of it.

658
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,510
I know what I'm doing.

659
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:44,980
Call the police,he goes backto his mother and her boyfriend,who abuses him,

660
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:50,700
and his father,whom he really loves,ends up in jail.

661
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,350
That's funny.

662
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,390
How is that funny?

663
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:57,070
You're supposed to callthe police,but you're not.

664
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,930
I want to call the police,but I can'T.

665
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,050
I can't even call the one cop

666
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:04,160
that I should be able to call'cause he'll just say"I told you so.

667
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:10,680
"My college call girl,she's not goa quit.

668
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:14,300
What peopledo to themselves...

669
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,970
yeah.

670
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,840
but I guess it's theirsto do,right?

671
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,400
I mean...

672
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:25,090
we can save their livesphysically,

673
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:28,020
but we can't make themlive their lives differently.

674
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:31,310
I guess if we're not them,if we're not in their shoes,

675
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:34,150
who are weto say what's best?

676
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,120
I feel like I'm gonnado something bad.

677
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,210
Excuse me?

678
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,910
I want to do something bad.

679
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,150
Well,no,no,no.It's not bad.

680
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,110
Actually,I think it's--

681
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:52,860
it's gonna monly sam and addisonare gonna hate me.

682
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:55,450
-Wyatt lockhart--
-you're gonna sleepwith wyatt lockhart?

683
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:56,870
No.No.No,no,no,no.

684
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:58,680
I'm considering consultingwith him on a case.

685
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,030
what,sleeping with him?

686
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:00,690
I'm sorry.

687
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:03,340
Y-you said thatit was something badbut it was gonna make youfeel good,so I--

688
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,960
so you went straight to sex?

689
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,030
I did.I did.

690
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,400
I went to sex.

691
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,380
I gotta get it together.

692
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,800
I'm sorry.

693
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,720
Hey,wait.

694
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,210
What do you think?

695
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,990
Am I bad?

696
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,660
Oh,uh...

697
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:19,200
well,I won't,uh...

698
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,520
I-I mean,I-I can'T...

699
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:25,890
well,I...I'm not...

700
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,500
I don't know.

701
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,380
I just...

702
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,690
I don't know.

703
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:40,420
Did you really think you weregonna get away with it?

704
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,780
I don't knowwhat you're talking abT.

705
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,640
Oh,cut the crap,cooper.

706
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,460
I know all about frank and evan,who they really are.

707
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,430
You're not the only one whocan do a little investigation.

708
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:49,130
Porter's social security numberwas bogus,

709
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:52,200
so I ran the serial numberon the insulin pumpwe pulled out of him.

710
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,390
Just stay out of it,charlotte.

711
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:54,610
You don't knowwhat's going on here.

712
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:55,780
I sure as hell do.

713
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:59,210
You are about two seconds awayfrom losing your medical licensefor harboring a fugitive.

714
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:00,650
Please tell meyou didn't call the police.

715
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:02,240
I did,ten minut ago.

716
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,240
You did this to punish mefor breaking up with you?

717
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,590
I did this to save your assfrom your misguided senseof I don't know what.

718
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:11,230
You shouldn't have done meany favors.

719
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,970
You're probably right.

720
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:21,540
You needto take a walk,now.

721
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:24,920
Ten vials of insulin,some alcohol wipestwo extra cannulas for the pump.

722
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,860
I put a journain there.You need to keep trackof his sugar and his carbs.

723
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,530
You need to fill that outevery day,

724
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,110
and you need to keepthat pump clean.

725
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:31,900
I will.

726
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,760
There's a service elevator.Take it to the ground floor.

727
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,170
Exit out the loading doors.

728
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:37,240
How could I thank you?

729
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,290
Take good care of your boy.

730
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:42,530
Thank you.

731
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:44,260
Thank youfor listening to me.

732
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:47,100
You just promise meyou'll keep reading,okay?

733
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,310
Go.

734
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,790
are you looking for me?

735
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:03,680
No,no,no.

736
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,000
I-I was,uh,just making some tea.

737
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:12,590
Hey,th--uh,thanks forthat talk today.That was...

738
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:15,730
really helpedput things in perspective.

739
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:17,070
Oh,good,good.

740
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,670
I'm glad.

741
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,330
-I better...
-yeah,yeah,you better.

742
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:46,010
Diyou have something morethat you wanted to say?

743
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:47,930
'Cause I thoughtmaybe you did.

744
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:51,010
Did I--did I cut you off?

745
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:39,330
meg.Meg.

746
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,470
I knew at dinnerthere was something.

747
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:42,110
I wanted to tell you.

748
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:45,240
If you wanted to be withsomeone else,why drag this on?

749
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,010
I'm sorry.

750
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,490
You pushed me awayafter I worked here.

751
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:48,870
I thought I was crowding you.

752
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:51,180
I guess I didn't realizewhat I was crowding.

753
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,070
I didn't mean to hurt you.

754
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:55,290
Well,I got hurt.

755
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,570
I know.

756
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:11,570
Don't say it.

757
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:12,840
Good,yoreoth here.

758
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,040
I,uh,I just wantedto let you know that...

759
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,750
I have decidedto consult with wyatt.

760
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,780
Naomi,this...

761
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,220
-it's wrong.
-I don't believe you.

762
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,520
After everything?

763
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,850
I wantto be inspired again.

764
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:30,210
After the practice...

765
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:34,110
I-I felt likeI had lost something,like I had given up,

766
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:37,490
and I don't want feel like that anymore.

767
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:38,730
It's just one patient.

768
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:41,530
It's not just one patient.

769
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:42,920
It's A...

770
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:46,160
it's a stepin the wrong direction.

771
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:50,490
And you take this step,and soon,people are gonna...

772
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,230
not call the policeon kidnappers

773
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:56,370
and help patients to lieto get into hospitals,and thenwhat are we gonna become?

774
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:57,730
no.

775
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:00,590
We are our actions,and if she sells out once,

776
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,030
then she's a personwho sells out.

777
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:04,040
I am not selling out.

778
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:09,350
You talk about this practice,the way it's supsed to run,

779
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:11,210
the way we're supposed totreat our patients.

780
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,120
You talk aboutnot wanting to give up,

781
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,290
and then you're gonnago downstairs to that placeto work with

782
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:20,510
that womanwho is doing everything possibleto undermine us,

783
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:24,920
to work for that manwho is more concernedabout getting recognized

784
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,640
for his workthan which patientlives or dies.

785
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:31,670
How is that not selling out?

786
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,580
You agree with him?

787
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:43,490
I agree that once you startdoing something,it's difficult to stop.

788
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:50,320
A police officer showed upin evan's hospital room.

789
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,720
You know what they found?

790
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,740
Your broomstick?

791
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,140
This isn't a joke,cooper.

792
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,310
You tipped 'em off.

793
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:58,000
You're obstructinga police investigation.

794
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,650
If they found out you wereinvolved in the disappearance,

795
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:01,760
you could go to jail.

796
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,670
I'll take my chances.

797
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,690
No,you won'T.

798
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:06,620
I covered for you.

799
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,260
Why?

800
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:11,530
Because now we're even.

801
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,550
You were right.

802
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:38,160
I don't know what it's liketo walk in your shoes.

803
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,080
But don't kid yourself,carley.

804
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,220
This isn't justa means to an end.

805
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:45,580
Because once you do this,it's who you are.

806
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,260
We are our actions.

807
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,360
They define us.

808
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,440
And you may thinkthat you're a med studentpaying for college,

809
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,820
but right now...

810
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:56,090
you're a hooker.

811
00:37:56,090 --> 00:38:00,730
-that's not--
-that's the worldyou've chosen.

812
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:04,440
I can't be your doctoranymore,carley.

813
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,900
I slept with pete.

814
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,110
There.I told you.

815
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:24,900
You know,I expected better from you.

816
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,740
-I'm sorry.It just happened-
-you know what?If that's howyou want to play it,fine.

817
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,360
What are you talking about?

818
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:31,480
When you're readyto be matureand tell mewho you really slept with,

819
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,840
I'll be around for you,violet.

820
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,030
I--I'm not lying to you.

821
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,480
I really slept with pete.

822
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,240
Okay.

823
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:36,870
Where are you going?

824
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:40,380
I don't want to be late formy date with angelina jolie.

825
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:10,490
uh,I use an inhaler.

826
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:12,200
I'm sorry.Do you needmedical attention?

827
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,250
No,that's,uh--my breathing...

828
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:19,300
uh,it gets badwhen I get worked up,so I need an inhaler.

829
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:23,150
When I getpset,I need it,uh,when I worout,I need it,

830
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:25,270
when I exert myself,I need it.

831
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:30,440
I'm prepared to line upten inhalersif that's what it takes,

832
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:34,520
because if youmess with naomi...

833
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:38,910
if you even think...

834
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:44,390
about screwing with her,I will take you out.

835
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,900
Not even a last night?

836
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,310
I don't live here,addison.

837
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:15,340
This isn't my home.

838
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:17,060
You're mad aboutmy ignoring your advice.

839
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,380
You've never been to my house.

840
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,070
You make fun owhere I live.

841
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:23,870
You pay peopleto clean up my houseso I won't have to go back,

842
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:25,770
and you won't have to either.

843
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:27,870
I did a nice thing.

844
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:32,690
Tell me the truth,if I didt get shot,would we still be together?

845
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:37,290
All thisbecause of my patient?

846
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:39,850
No,I-it just made me realizehow you see the world.

847
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:43,940
And the world that I live in,isn't always about beaches

848
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:47,870
and 1,000-count sheetsand hired helpto make everything look pretty.

849
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:50,370
When you were shot,i looked after you.

850
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:53,900
Here,in your comfort zone,so you didn't have togive up control,

851
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,170
because that'show you like it.

852
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:57,760
That is not true.

853
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:05,760
That's for the cleaning ladyand the gardener.
