1
00:00:00,007 --> 00:00:01,421
Tell me, Lynne, you under the influence

2
00:00:01,446 --> 00:00:02,723
of drugs right now?

3
00:00:02,748 --> 00:00:04,613
You all were handing out oxys
like candy,

4
00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:06,751
and now I'm left to fend for myself.

5
00:00:06,776 --> 00:00:08,108
But I wanna help you now.

6
00:00:08,142 --> 00:00:10,562
35-year-old female. Looks like an OD.

7
00:00:10,671 --> 00:00:12,562
Let's go. Clear.

8
00:00:13,137 --> 00:00:14,650
Come on, Lynne.

9
00:00:14,987 --> 00:00:16,730
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:19,785
You and I agreed what
happened was a mistake.

11
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,218
I have to tell Ethan.

12
00:00:22,587 --> 00:00:25,491
April Sexton, will you marry me?

13
00:00:25,516 --> 00:00:27,277
I don't thin I can have kids.

14
00:00:27,302 --> 00:00:29,714
Look, I love you no matter what.

15
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:30,796
Then yes.

16
00:00:39,705 --> 00:00:41,043
From the looks of that rock,

17
00:00:41,068 --> 00:00:42,935
I'm guessing you didn't tell Ethan.

18
00:00:43,689 --> 00:00:45,076
No, I didn't.

19
00:00:45,101 --> 00:00:47,545
And I would appreciate it if
you didn't mention it again.

20
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,453
Mention what?

21
00:00:54,173 --> 00:00:55,788
Morning, Mags.

22
00:00:56,843 --> 00:00:58,474
Big plans tonight?

23
00:00:59,938 --> 00:01:01,738
I'm actually going
before the board today.

24
00:01:01,804 --> 00:01:03,737
Uh-oh. What'd you do now?

25
00:01:03,762 --> 00:01:04,995
Funny.

26
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,820
I'm proposing opening a safe
injection site at the hospital.

27
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,772
Safe injection of what?

28
00:01:09,797 --> 00:01:11,146
Drugs.

29
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:13,105
People will be allowed to use,

30
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:14,493
but with medical staff on hand

31
00:01:14,518 --> 00:01:16,546
to resuscitate should anyone overdose.

32
00:01:16,681 --> 00:01:18,923
This because of that patient
you lost last week?

33
00:01:18,948 --> 00:01:20,924
- Lynne.
- Mm-hmm.

34
00:01:21,377 --> 00:01:23,274
She should not have died.

35
00:01:23,412 --> 00:01:25,868
She had a kid, Maggie.
Now he's an orphan.

36
00:01:25,893 --> 00:01:27,321
But that's not your fault.

37
00:01:27,346 --> 00:01:29,060
I gave her the pills.

38
00:01:29,085 --> 00:01:31,141
Her addiction started with me.

39
00:01:32,723 --> 00:01:34,289
How many other people did I do this to?

40
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:37,052
I gotta take this.

41
00:01:37,077 --> 00:01:38,643
Listen, everyone,

42
00:01:38,788 --> 00:01:40,863
there was an accident at O'Hare.

43
00:01:40,888 --> 00:01:43,154
They're routing victims
to us and East Mercy.

44
00:01:43,179 --> 00:01:44,382
Any word on what happened?

45
00:01:44,407 --> 00:01:46,424
An electrical fire in the cabin.

46
00:01:46,449 --> 00:01:48,174
Our first victim is coming in now.

47
00:01:48,199 --> 00:01:49,632
Marcel, you're with Dr. Choi.

48
00:01:49,657 --> 00:01:52,259
We're going to Baghdad. Desmond?

49
00:01:52,284 --> 00:01:54,530
Male, age unknown, was
seated in the front

50
00:01:54,555 --> 00:01:56,259
of the plane where the fire started.

51
00:01:56,284 --> 00:01:58,979
55% TBSA. Full-thickness burns.

52
00:01:59,004 --> 00:02:01,652
GCS 3. BP 70/45.

53
00:02:01,677 --> 00:02:03,992
Blunt trauma and suspected
C-spine injury.

54
00:02:04,017 --> 00:02:05,900
- Couldn't get a line in.
- You know his name?

55
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:08,211
Working on it. Airline
gave us a manifest.

56
00:02:08,236 --> 00:02:10,493
We're identifying victims
based on seat assignments.

57
00:02:10,518 --> 00:02:12,537
Okay, let's transfer him on my count.

58
00:02:12,562 --> 00:02:15,320
Everybody ready? One, two, three.

59
00:02:15,585 --> 00:02:18,035
Cross table C-spine,
chest, and pelvic X-ray.

60
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,328
Yes, Doctor.

61
00:02:19,353 --> 00:02:21,111
No place to get an IV in the arms.

62
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,883
Okay, give me an IO drill.

63
00:02:22,908 --> 00:02:24,236
Breath sounds bilaterally.

64
00:02:24,261 --> 00:02:26,954
Okay, victim's name is Samuel Abrams.

65
00:02:28,838 --> 00:02:30,288
What?

66
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,291
No, it's just our head of neurosurgery

67
00:02:32,316 --> 00:02:33,515
is Sam Abrams, but...

68
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,572
There's got to be a dozen

69
00:02:34,597 --> 00:02:35,863
Sam Abrams in Chicago.

70
00:02:35,888 --> 00:02:37,136
Wait, but I do think that Sam

71
00:02:37,161 --> 00:02:38,517
was traveling somewhere, though.

72
00:02:38,542 --> 00:02:40,171
Do you know where the
plane was coming from?

73
00:02:40,196 --> 00:02:42,498
Honolulu. Flight 3376.

74
00:02:45,306 --> 00:02:46,713
Dr. Charles,

75
00:02:46,862 --> 00:02:48,828
do you know where Sam was traveling to?

76
00:02:48,853 --> 00:02:53,149
Um, neurosurgery
conference in Honolulu.

77
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,917
Coming back today, I think.

78
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:56,559
Mags, see if anyone in neurosurgery

79
00:02:56,584 --> 00:02:58,169
knows what return flight he was on.

80
00:02:58,194 --> 00:02:59,463
Already on it.

81
00:02:59,738 --> 00:03:01,076
Why? What's going on?

82
00:03:01,101 --> 00:03:02,754
X-ray. Clear.

83
00:03:02,779 --> 00:03:05,898
- This could be Dr. Abrams.
- What?

84
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:08,551
See if you can reach him on his cell.

85
00:03:08,576 --> 00:03:10,523
C4 on 5 subluxation.

86
00:03:10,548 --> 00:03:12,183
Could be a catastrophic injury.

87
00:03:14,715 --> 00:03:16,717
Straight to voicemail.

88
00:03:17,761 --> 00:03:20,235
Sam was on flight 3376.

89
00:03:26,613 --> 00:03:32,563
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

90
00:03:36,027 --> 00:03:37,440
I'm all out of rooms.

91
00:03:37,465 --> 00:03:39,280
You're gonna have to
double up in trauma 2.

92
00:03:39,584 --> 00:03:41,792
- Need some help outside.
- Another victim from O'Hare?

93
00:03:41,817 --> 00:03:43,917
Yep, Layla Bistarkey,
36, in premature labor.

94
00:03:43,942 --> 00:03:45,192
Heavy vaginal bleeding.

95
00:03:45,217 --> 00:03:46,441
Suspect she abrupted on impact.

96
00:03:46,466 --> 00:03:47,877
Maggie, call up to labor and delivery.

97
00:03:47,902 --> 00:03:48,916
Have them open up an OR.

98
00:03:48,941 --> 00:03:50,254
No time. She's already crowning.

99
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:52,254
Dr. Sexton, April, you go and help.

100
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:54,874
Yup.

101
00:03:54,899 --> 00:03:56,277
- She have any burns?
- No.

102
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:57,633
She and her husband were
in the back of the plane,

103
00:03:57,658 --> 00:03:58,658
evacuated first.

104
00:03:58,683 --> 00:03:59,869
Fire never reached them.

105
00:03:59,894 --> 00:04:01,518
- I'm here. I'm here.
- My baby...

106
00:04:01,543 --> 00:04:02,989
Just breathe.

107
00:04:03,014 --> 00:04:04,280
Heart tone's 140.

108
00:04:04,305 --> 00:04:05,468
She isn't due for another four weeks.

109
00:04:05,493 --> 00:04:07,106
This is our last embryo.

110
00:04:07,131 --> 00:04:08,904
So, please don't... oh, God.

111
00:04:10,051 --> 00:04:11,284
I can see the baby's head.

112
00:04:11,309 --> 00:04:13,143
- Heart rate is dropping.
- We gotta do this here.

113
00:04:13,168 --> 00:04:14,418
- You're okay.
- Layla...

114
00:04:14,443 --> 00:04:15,683
we've got to get your
baby out right now.

115
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,147
I need you to push with all your might.

116
00:04:17,172 --> 00:04:18,561
- I...
- Now, Layla.

117
00:04:18,586 --> 00:04:20,996
Layla, bear down. Push.

118
00:04:21,021 --> 00:04:23,367
Now... yes.

119
00:04:23,392 --> 00:04:24,453
Come on! Push!

120
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:27,343
That's it.

121
00:04:27,368 --> 00:04:29,236
You're almost there. Keep going.

122
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:30,816
- A little more.
- Through the mouth.

123
00:04:30,841 --> 00:04:33,559
- Oh, my God.
- Yes! Yes.

124
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,188
You did it.

125
00:04:37,213 --> 00:04:38,913
Baby.

126
00:04:38,938 --> 00:04:41,371
Baby.

127
00:04:44,131 --> 00:04:47,168
Hi, my love. Oh.

128
00:04:56,818 --> 00:04:59,319
I know. Yes, yes. I know.

129
00:04:59,344 --> 00:05:01,933
Just tell them we'll
start in 15 minutes.

130
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,257
Yes.

131
00:05:03,282 --> 00:05:07,996
And move my, uh, 3:00. Move it to 4:30.

132
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:10,499
Yes...

133
00:05:10,524 --> 00:05:12,603
Look, I gotta go.

134
00:05:17,253 --> 00:05:18,752
- Hey.
- Have you heard?

135
00:05:18,794 --> 00:05:19,939
No. What?

136
00:05:19,964 --> 00:05:21,885
There was a plane crash at O'Hare.

137
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,515
Oh, no. No, I... I...

138
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,390
I've been tied up. How many victims?

139
00:05:25,415 --> 00:05:27,339
Well, I haven't gotten a headcount yet.

140
00:05:27,364 --> 00:05:28,650
Oh, goodness.

141
00:05:28,675 --> 00:05:30,337
I'll keep you posted.

142
00:05:30,465 --> 00:05:31,664
Oh, wait.

143
00:05:31,689 --> 00:05:33,811
This proposal from Dr. Halstead?

144
00:05:33,836 --> 00:05:35,311
- Yeah.
- A safe injection site?

145
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:37,402
Well, there are already
facilities like that

146
00:05:37,427 --> 00:05:39,562
overseas and in Canada.

147
00:05:39,587 --> 00:05:41,978
Yeah, none in the U.S....
Not aboveboard.

148
00:05:42,003 --> 00:05:44,589
Well, the judge in
Philadelphia just ruled

149
00:05:44,614 --> 00:05:48,048
that a proposed site there
doesn't violate federal law.

150
00:05:48,073 --> 00:05:49,332
Sharon, the legal battles alone

151
00:05:49,357 --> 00:05:50,636
would cost this hospital a fortune.

152
00:05:50,661 --> 00:05:53,729
Yeah, but preventing deaths
would save the hospital money

153
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:54,791
in the long run.

154
00:05:54,816 --> 00:05:56,418
Not to mention the PR value

155
00:05:56,443 --> 00:05:57,833
of being the first hospital...

156
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,062
To allow drug use on our premises?

157
00:06:00,547 --> 00:06:03,474
"A PR nightmare" is how I'd put it.

158
00:06:05,921 --> 00:06:07,729
- Sharon.
- Yes.

159
00:06:08,321 --> 00:06:11,324
Sam Abrams was on that
plane that crashed today.

160
00:06:11,655 --> 00:06:13,247
Oh, no.

161
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:14,473
He survived?

162
00:06:14,498 --> 00:06:15,864
He did.

163
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:17,445
But he's severely burned

164
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,409
and in very bad shape.

165
00:06:19,976 --> 00:06:21,142
Okay.

166
00:06:21,301 --> 00:06:22,745
Thanks, Daniel.

167
00:06:25,183 --> 00:06:27,304
We did four rounds of IVF.

168
00:06:27,827 --> 00:06:30,758
I can't believe it. Is she really here?

169
00:06:30,884 --> 00:06:33,085
She's really here.

170
00:06:33,613 --> 00:06:35,955
- Gosh, let me see this.
- Yeah.

171
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,481
Where in the world did
this red hair come from?

172
00:06:38,506 --> 00:06:39,935
Don't look at me.

173
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,221
Every Bistarkey since the
Stone Age has been brunette.

174
00:06:42,246 --> 00:06:43,752
As the only ginger in my family,

175
00:06:43,777 --> 00:06:46,378
I can tell you the redheaded
gene is recessive.

176
00:06:46,403 --> 00:06:48,839
So it's possible it just
hasn't expressed until now.

177
00:06:49,446 --> 00:06:50,921
- Noah.
- Hmm?

178
00:06:50,946 --> 00:06:52,645
Do her hands look a little blue to you?

179
00:06:55,537 --> 00:06:58,528
Hey Layla, I just need to take
a quick look at something.

180
00:06:58,553 --> 00:07:00,592
Okay. Who's this?

181
00:07:00,617 --> 00:07:02,522
Who's this guy?

182
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,495
Who's that?

183
00:07:04,974 --> 00:07:07,052
Chest is mottled. Feet are blue.

184
00:07:07,077 --> 00:07:09,221
- Why is she breathing so hard?
- Uh, give her to me.

185
00:07:09,246 --> 00:07:10,918
Okay.

186
00:07:11,601 --> 00:07:13,409
She's retracting.

187
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:15,203
I'm gonna try to clear
out more secretions.

188
00:07:22,263 --> 00:07:23,847
Still struggling.
Blow-by with Ambu bag.

189
00:07:23,872 --> 00:07:25,357
Is she okay? What's wrong with her?

190
00:07:25,382 --> 00:07:26,689
Transfer her to the NICU.

191
00:07:26,714 --> 00:07:28,463
- Wait.
- Don't worry.

192
00:07:28,488 --> 00:07:30,147
We're gonna figure out what's going on.

193
00:07:35,395 --> 00:07:37,643
Where are you taking my girl?

194
00:07:38,027 --> 00:07:39,693
This...

195
00:07:39,868 --> 00:07:41,925
Can't be my Sam.

196
00:07:43,436 --> 00:07:44,663
Are you sure?

197
00:07:44,688 --> 00:07:46,078
Paramedics used the flight manifest

198
00:07:46,103 --> 00:07:47,569
to identify Sam by his seat number.

199
00:07:47,595 --> 00:07:48,632
I dunno.

200
00:07:48,657 --> 00:07:50,969
Maybe he switched seats with someone.

201
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,755
We recovered this from his pocket.

202
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,595
Oh... Honey...

203
00:08:00,769 --> 00:08:03,414
- No.
- I'm so sorry.

204
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,476
You must be Lucy.

205
00:08:07,501 --> 00:08:09,735
I'm Dr. Choi. You father's a friend.

206
00:08:09,955 --> 00:08:12,924
What... no, um, I'm not Sam's daughter.

207
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:14,516
Um, I'm sorry.

208
00:08:14,548 --> 00:08:17,984
This is Sam's wife, Michelle.

209
00:08:18,408 --> 00:08:20,753
Lucy's backpacking in
South America right now,

210
00:08:20,778 --> 00:08:23,168
and I haven't been
able to reach her yet.

211
00:08:24,231 --> 00:08:25,865
My apologies.

212
00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:27,844
They're ready for Dr. Abrams in CT.

213
00:08:27,869 --> 00:08:29,922
- Okay.
- Can I go with him?

214
00:08:29,947 --> 00:08:31,921
Of course. I'll take you up.

215
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,446
Hey, Maggie.

216
00:08:46,471 --> 00:08:48,499
- Hey.
- How's Dr. Abrams doing?

217
00:08:48,675 --> 00:08:50,146
He went up to CT.

218
00:08:50,171 --> 00:08:51,701
We'll know more after we see his scans.

219
00:08:51,726 --> 00:08:53,386
I can't believe it.

220
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:55,915
So...

221
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,696
couldn't help but
notice your tête-à-tête

222
00:08:57,721 --> 00:08:59,667
with Crockett this morning.

223
00:09:00,729 --> 00:09:02,495
Looked a little tense.

224
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,938
It was nothing.

225
00:09:04,602 --> 00:09:06,135
You sure?

226
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,593
I'm sure.

227
00:09:07,618 --> 00:09:08,798
Good.

228
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,362
Great news about you and Ethan.

229
00:09:11,387 --> 00:09:13,132
Thanks.

230
00:09:13,701 --> 00:09:18,016
All I want is to marry him and
forget this ever happened.

231
00:09:21,722 --> 00:09:23,952
So Mazie has a genetic condition.

232
00:09:23,977 --> 00:09:26,838
Surfactant protein deficiency. SP-B.

233
00:09:27,392 --> 00:09:29,872
It's a kind of
interstitial lung disease.

234
00:09:29,897 --> 00:09:31,150
"Interstitial"?

235
00:09:31,175 --> 00:09:32,773
It means the scarring of the lungs,

236
00:09:32,798 --> 00:09:34,220
making it difficult to breathe.

237
00:09:34,245 --> 00:09:35,662
So what do we have to do?

238
00:09:35,687 --> 00:09:37,553
Does she have to go on medication or...

239
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,375
No. Unfortunately, the only
effective treatment option

240
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,093
is a lung transplant.

241
00:09:43,091 --> 00:09:44,566
Now?

242
00:09:44,591 --> 00:09:45,889
But she's so little.

243
00:09:45,914 --> 00:09:46,961
I don't understand.

244
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,292
Her embryo was tested
for genetic disorders

245
00:09:49,317 --> 00:09:50,834
prior to implantation.

246
00:09:50,859 --> 00:09:53,008
It's possible that this was missed

247
00:09:53,033 --> 00:09:55,427
or wasn't even included in the testing.

248
00:09:55,452 --> 00:09:57,197
- It's a very rare condition.
- Yeah.

249
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,919
How will she get a lung
that's small enough?

250
00:10:00,847 --> 00:10:03,956
Does another baby have to...
have to die first?

251
00:10:04,213 --> 00:10:06,430
Well, there's also a
living-donor option.

252
00:10:06,455 --> 00:10:07,935
The lower lobes of a lung

253
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,624
from two donors are transplanted.

254
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:11,889
If you're matches, you both can donate.

255
00:10:13,555 --> 00:10:16,493
You should know, it is a major surgery,

256
00:10:16,518 --> 00:10:18,882
followed by four to six
weeks of recovery.

257
00:10:22,085 --> 00:10:25,225
- But of course we'll do it.
- Yeah, anything Mazie needs.

258
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,604
Okay, we'll get you
both tested right away.

259
00:10:36,328 --> 00:10:39,095
Oh, God.

260
00:10:50,396 --> 00:10:52,129
Trini, come quick!

261
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,842
What? What's going on?

262
00:10:53,867 --> 00:10:55,563
There's a baby in the back of the car.

263
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:56,937
- Is he breathing?
- I don't know.

264
00:10:56,962 --> 00:10:58,782
Stand back.

265
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:09,033
He's breathing shallow
and he's unresponsive.

266
00:11:09,058 --> 00:11:10,944
You're okay.

267
00:11:10,969 --> 00:11:13,566
You're okay. Come here.

268
00:11:13,591 --> 00:11:15,992
Okay. Let's go.

269
00:11:17,648 --> 00:11:19,657
Get warming blankets and start an IV.

270
00:11:19,682 --> 00:11:20,919
You got it.

271
00:11:20,944 --> 00:11:22,102
Trini, get a core temp.

272
00:11:24,114 --> 00:11:26,532
Wake up, honey. Wake up.

273
00:11:26,655 --> 00:11:27,888
Wake up.

274
00:11:27,913 --> 00:11:29,482
Core temp's 94.

275
00:11:29,507 --> 00:11:30,868
He's hypothermic.

276
00:11:30,893 --> 00:11:33,802
All right, let's bolus
10ccs per kilo of warm...

277
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:37,335
You're okay. You're okay.

278
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,016
I'm working with security
to locate the parents.

279
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,265
Where was the car parked?

280
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:43,647
Third floor of the parking
structure, south end.

281
00:11:43,672 --> 00:11:45,150
That's administrative parking.

282
00:11:45,175 --> 00:11:47,919
Do either of you remember
the color or make?

283
00:11:47,944 --> 00:11:49,677
Dark gray BMW.

284
00:11:51,497 --> 00:11:52,884
Do you know it?

285
00:11:52,909 --> 00:11:54,765
That's Gwen Garrett's car.

286
00:12:12,973 --> 00:12:14,896
His name is Devon, right?

287
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,204
Yes. Devon.

288
00:12:17,979 --> 00:12:21,120
What is he? About seven months?

289
00:12:21,966 --> 00:12:23,532
Eight.

290
00:12:27,652 --> 00:12:33,296
You know, when my son Michael
was about six years old,

291
00:12:33,506 --> 00:12:37,441
I took him school shopping
with his baby sister Tara.

292
00:12:38,903 --> 00:12:43,719
And Tara was throwing some kind of fit

293
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:49,379
about these red, sparkly Mary Janes.

294
00:12:50,545 --> 00:12:56,103
And I turned away from
Michael for a second,

295
00:12:56,128 --> 00:12:58,144
and when I looked back,

296
00:12:59,648 --> 00:13:01,489
he was gone.

297
00:13:03,714 --> 00:13:07,385
And I remember how sick
I felt at that moment.

298
00:13:08,051 --> 00:13:09,477
Where was he?

299
00:13:09,512 --> 00:13:12,450
Hiding under a clothes rack.

300
00:13:16,538 --> 00:13:18,442
Anyway...

301
00:13:19,024 --> 00:13:21,109
I know how hard it can be sometimes

302
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,932
just managing as a mother.

303
00:13:25,534 --> 00:13:27,967
My husband, Mark... oh.

304
00:13:27,992 --> 00:13:31,429
Excuse me... my soon-to-be ex-husband,

305
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:35,206
he usually drops Devon off
at daycare on Wednesdays,

306
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:38,243
but we switched schedules this week.

307
00:13:38,268 --> 00:13:42,043
I'm sorry, I didn't know you
were going through a divorce.

308
00:13:44,515 --> 00:13:49,080
Well, it's turning into a
contentious custody battle,

309
00:13:49,105 --> 00:13:50,710
unfortunately.

310
00:13:50,785 --> 00:13:53,493
Well, you're obviously juggling a lot.

311
00:13:53,715 --> 00:13:56,479
I totally forgot that
I had him with me.

312
00:13:58,469 --> 00:14:01,042
I should have double-checked
the back seat.

313
00:14:01,431 --> 00:14:04,171
Yes, that's true.

314
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:09,315
You were very lucky this time, Gwen.

315
00:14:12,554 --> 00:14:14,421
And I'm sure you won't
make that mistake again.

316
00:14:14,446 --> 00:14:16,134
No, I won't.

317
00:14:22,502 --> 00:14:24,861
Thank you, Sharon.

318
00:14:38,681 --> 00:14:40,469
Oh, my God.

319
00:14:41,457 --> 00:14:43,159
Um, wait.

320
00:14:43,184 --> 00:14:47,488
You're... you're saying
he'll never walk again?

321
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:51,757
He'll... he'll never be able
to use his hands again?

322
00:14:51,782 --> 00:14:53,379
I'm very sorry.

323
00:14:53,553 --> 00:14:56,048
But we are optimistic Sam will wake up

324
00:14:56,073 --> 00:14:58,258
once the swelling in
his brain goes down.

325
00:14:58,688 --> 00:15:00,402
And, um...

326
00:15:00,636 --> 00:15:02,209
he'll... he'll be able to talk to me?

327
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,277
We're hopeful

328
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:04,699
he'll be able to communicate.

329
00:15:04,888 --> 00:15:06,955
Scans showed no major brain injury.

330
00:15:07,827 --> 00:15:10,298
And what about feeding

331
00:15:10,323 --> 00:15:13,333
and... and... and
dressing himself and...

332
00:15:16,012 --> 00:15:18,827
He'll be dependent on others for that.

333
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:21,866
For... for how long?

334
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,029
The rest of his life.

335
00:15:26,337 --> 00:15:30,071
Sam and I were supposed to
go to Italy next month.

336
00:15:32,214 --> 00:15:33,880
I'm sorry, I just...

337
00:15:33,922 --> 00:15:36,107
I'll be right back. I
just need a minute.

338
00:15:38,152 --> 00:15:39,588
Oh, man.

339
00:15:39,613 --> 00:15:41,406
A lot to put on a young
woman's shoulders.

340
00:15:41,431 --> 00:15:43,765
Yeah.

341
00:15:48,317 --> 00:15:50,906
- Looking sharp, Dr. Halstead.
- Yeah.

342
00:15:51,043 --> 00:15:53,368
Okay, so I gotta... I gotta go
practice this presentation.

343
00:15:53,393 --> 00:15:55,284
You're still cool to
handle the Bistarkey case?

344
00:15:55,309 --> 00:15:57,713
Oh, yeah. just waiting on Layla
and Patrick's test results.

345
00:15:57,738 --> 00:15:59,465
- Just keep me posted.
- Will do.

346
00:16:00,347 --> 00:16:01,663
- Hey.
- Hey.

347
00:16:01,697 --> 00:16:02,835
How they holding up?

348
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,992
Not so great. They're worried sick.

349
00:16:07,288 --> 00:16:09,025
The Bistarkey's labs just came back.

350
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:11,200
- Oh, thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

351
00:16:11,787 --> 00:16:13,354
Dad isn't a match.

352
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:14,745
- Mm.
- But Mom is.

353
00:16:14,786 --> 00:16:16,685
Well, that's a start.

354
00:16:17,928 --> 00:16:20,283
- Hold on, um...
- What?

355
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:29,506
So the good news is
Layla is a donor match.

356
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:31,674
I am? Oh, thank God.

357
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,992
But Patrick, unfortunately, is not.

358
00:16:35,017 --> 00:16:36,486
It's okay.

359
00:16:36,594 --> 00:16:39,493
Okay, well, uh, still, we're
halfway there, right?

360
00:16:39,737 --> 00:16:41,304
What's next? What do we need to do?

361
00:16:41,329 --> 00:16:43,779
Does Mazie's second donor
have to be blood-related?

362
00:16:43,804 --> 00:16:44,995
Not necessarily,

363
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,015
and we'll definitely
go over the next steps

364
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,274
for getting Mazie onto
the transplant list,

365
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:50,999
but, um, before we do...

366
00:16:52,528 --> 00:16:54,813
Patrick, there are a few documents

367
00:16:54,838 --> 00:16:56,989
you still need to sign, if you
wouldn't mind following me.

368
00:16:57,014 --> 00:16:59,105
Documents? I mean, can't that wait?

369
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:01,427
Technically, they should've
already been taken care of...

370
00:17:01,452 --> 00:17:03,704
Whoa. What's up?

371
00:17:04,855 --> 00:17:08,325
Whatever you need to share with
me, my husband can hear too.

372
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,781
Testing revealed that...

373
00:17:13,204 --> 00:17:16,372
Patrick is not Mazie's
biological father.

374
00:17:16,397 --> 00:17:18,394
- What?
- Not her father?

375
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:19,988
Obviously there's been
some kind of mistake

376
00:17:20,013 --> 00:17:22,145
because that's... I mean,
that's just wrong.

377
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:23,221
Patrick is her father.

378
00:17:23,246 --> 00:17:24,865
How would that even be possible?

379
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,141
Usually there would be no
reason to even bring this up.

380
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,944
It's just that Mazie's
best chance at a match

381
00:17:29,969 --> 00:17:31,171
is a blood relative.

382
00:17:31,196 --> 00:17:32,964
And if we can gain contact
with the father...

383
00:17:32,989 --> 00:17:35,330
Oh, my God! Patrick is the father!

384
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:37,442
There's obviously something
wrong with your tests.

385
00:17:37,467 --> 00:17:39,080
We'll, um...

386
00:17:39,511 --> 00:17:41,007
we'll run the labs again,

387
00:17:41,165 --> 00:17:42,760
see if we can get to
the bottom of this.

388
00:17:42,785 --> 00:17:44,038
Yeah, you do that.

389
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,785
- Devon's father.
- Oh, my God!

390
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,822
- Is he okay?
- Shh, shh.

391
00:17:54,847 --> 00:17:56,745
- He's sleeping. He's fine.
- What the hell, Gwen?

392
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:58,016
I must've called you a dozen times.

393
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:00,019
Sandy said you never
showed up to daycare.

394
00:18:00,554 --> 00:18:03,722
Um, Devon woke up with a runny nose.

395
00:18:03,747 --> 00:18:05,382
And he was coughing last night,

396
00:18:05,407 --> 00:18:07,609
so I just thought that I'd bring him in

397
00:18:07,634 --> 00:18:09,490
so he could get checked out.

398
00:18:10,533 --> 00:18:12,744
Better safe than sorry, right?

399
00:18:13,313 --> 00:18:14,948
Uh...

400
00:18:15,258 --> 00:18:17,754
I'm gonna leave you two.

401
00:18:21,063 --> 00:18:22,657
You should have picked up your cell.

402
00:18:22,682 --> 00:18:24,409
I thought you were in an accident.

403
00:18:24,434 --> 00:18:25,631
So that's it?

404
00:18:25,656 --> 00:18:27,577
We're just gonna keep
Gwen's husband in the dark?

405
00:18:27,602 --> 00:18:29,486
Well, I think she's afraid he'll use it

406
00:18:29,511 --> 00:18:32,121
as ammunition to get full custody.

407
00:18:32,388 --> 00:18:35,227
Listen, if anyone was trying
to take Owen away from me,

408
00:18:35,252 --> 00:18:36,430
I don't know what I would do.

409
00:18:36,455 --> 00:18:37,649
But if something ever happened to him

410
00:18:37,674 --> 00:18:39,172
and someone kept it from me...

411
00:18:39,197 --> 00:18:40,709
Trust me, I'm right there with you.

412
00:18:40,734 --> 00:18:42,385
He has every right to know the truth,

413
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,609
but the truth should come from Gwen.

414
00:18:44,634 --> 00:18:46,366
I can't lie to my patient's father.

415
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:48,199
I'm not asking you to do that.

416
00:18:48,224 --> 00:18:51,311
Just give me a chance to
speak with her first.

417
00:18:52,248 --> 00:18:54,330
- Okay.
- All right.

418
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,922
Hey, Michelle.

419
00:18:56,947 --> 00:18:58,631
I know you had some
questions pertaining

420
00:18:58,656 --> 00:18:59,776
to Sam's care earlier.

421
00:18:59,801 --> 00:19:01,212
- So I brought you a...
- Thank you.

422
00:19:01,237 --> 00:19:02,370
Um...

423
00:19:02,577 --> 00:19:04,748
I've decided I want...

424
00:19:05,207 --> 00:19:07,251
Sam taken off life support.

425
00:19:08,628 --> 00:19:10,144
Oh.

426
00:19:10,169 --> 00:19:11,835
Um...

427
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,388
Michelle, do you know
what you're saying?

428
00:19:14,413 --> 00:19:16,856
When I married Sam, I made a vow.

429
00:19:17,703 --> 00:19:20,992
For better or for worse,
and I meant that.

430
00:19:21,428 --> 00:19:23,640
But this isn't about what I want.

431
00:19:23,982 --> 00:19:26,323
It's about what Sam would want.

432
00:19:26,348 --> 00:19:28,562
That's right. It is.

433
00:19:28,587 --> 00:19:30,475
And there are still plenty
of things we can do

434
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,811
to positively affect Sam's outcome.

435
00:19:32,836 --> 00:19:34,341
He could still have a meaningful life.

436
00:19:34,366 --> 00:19:35,814
How?

437
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:38,249
I mean, not being able
to operate again?

438
00:19:38,406 --> 00:19:41,530
Not be able to feed or...
or... or bathe himself?

439
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:42,839
No.

440
00:19:42,864 --> 00:19:44,656
No, my husband is a proud man.

441
00:19:44,681 --> 00:19:46,310
He's fiercely independent.

442
00:19:46,965 --> 00:19:49,581
He would resent me
forever, and I just...

443
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:52,006
I... I just can't do that to him.

444
00:19:52,031 --> 00:19:53,401
We understand.

445
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:56,051
Michelle, I just wonder
if this is a decision

446
00:19:56,076 --> 00:19:57,374
you should be taking on alone.

447
00:19:57,399 --> 00:19:59,938
Who else would take it on?
I'm his wife.

448
00:19:59,963 --> 00:20:01,203
You are. Of a few months.

449
00:20:01,228 --> 00:20:03,060
- Dr. Choi.
- Excuse me?

450
00:20:03,085 --> 00:20:04,901
I'm sorry. With all due respect,

451
00:20:04,926 --> 00:20:07,664
his daughter might be better
equipped to make this decision.

452
00:20:07,675 --> 00:20:10,814
I think what Dr. Choi means is that

453
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:14,071
maybe we should wait for Lucy
to come and say her goodbyes.

454
00:20:14,096 --> 00:20:15,453
No, that's not what I mean.

455
00:20:15,478 --> 00:20:17,621
Lucy has known Sam her whole life.

456
00:20:17,646 --> 00:20:19,496
- Dr. Choi...
- Don't you think she should

457
00:20:19,521 --> 00:20:21,163
be able to speak for him?

458
00:20:21,188 --> 00:20:23,658
Sam wouldn't want Lucy to
have to make this call,

459
00:20:23,683 --> 00:20:26,901
and he wouldn't want her
to see him like this.

460
00:20:26,936 --> 00:20:29,721
He would want her to
remember him at his best.

461
00:20:30,044 --> 00:20:31,627
Okay.

462
00:20:31,877 --> 00:20:33,736
We'll get the paperwork started.

463
00:20:43,182 --> 00:20:44,413
What's up?

464
00:20:44,438 --> 00:20:46,627
Had HR check Sam's
life insurance policy.

465
00:20:46,652 --> 00:20:47,741
Turns out Michelle's on it.

466
00:20:47,766 --> 00:20:49,458
She stands to gain millions.

467
00:20:50,464 --> 00:20:52,164
Not surprising.

468
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,276
She married him three
months after meeting him,

469
00:20:54,301 --> 00:20:55,744
and from what his colleagues tell me,

470
00:20:55,769 --> 00:20:57,299
she was the one who rushed it.

471
00:20:57,324 --> 00:20:59,024
You know what they say.

472
00:20:59,185 --> 00:21:01,160
When you know, you know.

473
00:21:02,152 --> 00:21:03,751
Look, I get it... Your whole shtick.

474
00:21:03,776 --> 00:21:05,263
You don't get invested.

475
00:21:05,288 --> 00:21:06,851
"Shtick"?

476
00:21:06,993 --> 00:21:10,438
No, I just don't stick my
nose where it doesn't belong.

477
00:21:10,618 --> 00:21:12,592
You know, like looking into a patient's

478
00:21:12,617 --> 00:21:14,174
life insurance policy.

479
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,431
Which med school class
they teach that in?

480
00:21:16,456 --> 00:21:18,048
First rule of medicine...

481
00:21:18,073 --> 00:21:19,714
is "do no harm."

482
00:21:19,739 --> 00:21:21,310
I'm not gonna ignore the red flags

483
00:21:21,335 --> 00:21:22,966
just because you can't be bothered.

484
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:25,984
Look, bottom line, Michelle
is Sam's next of kin.

485
00:21:26,009 --> 00:21:28,342
If she wants him off the
vent, we're taking him off.

486
00:21:28,367 --> 00:21:30,034
Yeah, we'll see about that.

487
00:21:30,326 --> 00:21:32,926
I'm convening an emergency
ethics committee.

488
00:21:37,256 --> 00:21:39,522
You know, this is probably my fault.

489
00:21:40,334 --> 00:21:42,754
The other night, on my
way to my mom's house...

490
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:44,312
And I was in a rush...

491
00:21:44,337 --> 00:21:46,182
I ran out without even
putting a coat on him.

492
00:21:46,207 --> 00:21:47,910
And I know better. I just...

493
00:21:47,935 --> 00:21:49,843
We all make mistakes.

494
00:21:50,261 --> 00:21:51,989
Right, Dr. Manning?

495
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,710
The good news is, Devon's
temperature is back to normal

496
00:21:55,735 --> 00:21:58,285
and he is alert and engaged.

497
00:21:58,472 --> 00:22:01,709
Isn't that right, buddy?

498
00:22:01,734 --> 00:22:03,467
You should be able to
discharge him soon.

499
00:22:05,716 --> 00:22:06,843
It's my mom.

500
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:08,564
I'm just gonna give her a quick update.

501
00:22:08,589 --> 00:22:09,987
Right.

502
00:22:10,379 --> 00:22:11,475
Gwen.

503
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,646
Please leave me out of this.

504
00:22:12,671 --> 00:22:14,453
I do not feel comfortable.

505
00:22:14,478 --> 00:22:16,907
You have no idea what
I'm dealing with here.

506
00:22:16,932 --> 00:22:18,801
Just don't say anything.

507
00:22:18,826 --> 00:22:20,525
I'm begging you.

508
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:23,507
- All good?
- Yup.

509
00:22:23,532 --> 00:22:25,826
She's gonna bring over her
chicken soup tonight.

510
00:22:28,593 --> 00:22:30,420
Ms. Garrett, the board
meeting is in 15.

511
00:22:30,445 --> 00:22:32,450
Uh, we should reschedule.
My son is still...

512
00:22:32,475 --> 00:22:34,360
Go. I got this.

513
00:22:34,472 --> 00:22:36,071
Okay?

514
00:22:40,753 --> 00:22:42,617
Drug overdose in the U.S.

515
00:22:42,642 --> 00:22:45,516
is the leading cause of
death in people under 50.

516
00:22:45,869 --> 00:22:48,516
More than 68,000 Americans
died last year...

517
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:51,569
Dr. Halstead, we're all aware
of the devastating effects

518
00:22:51,594 --> 00:22:52,807
of the opioid crisis.

519
00:22:52,832 --> 00:22:55,257
What I don't understand is why
you want to make it easier

520
00:22:55,282 --> 00:22:57,359
for addicts to use drugs.

521
00:22:57,384 --> 00:22:58,839
And having the site here.

522
00:22:58,864 --> 00:23:00,957
It looks like we're condoning drug use.

523
00:23:00,982 --> 00:23:02,582
No, no. We're not condoning it.

524
00:23:02,607 --> 00:23:04,208
We're just trying to save lives

525
00:23:04,233 --> 00:23:05,498
while also offering counseling...

526
00:23:05,523 --> 00:23:06,966
Do you have any evidence

527
00:23:06,991 --> 00:23:09,495
that these facilities achieve that end?

528
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,345
I do.

529
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:13,831
Uh...

530
00:23:18,483 --> 00:23:21,450
A review of 75 studies shows
that safe injection sites

531
00:23:21,475 --> 00:23:23,072
reduce overdose deaths

532
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:25,499
and the transmission of
infectious diseases,

533
00:23:25,524 --> 00:23:28,196
while increasing the number
of people starting treatment.

534
00:23:28,221 --> 00:23:29,522
Okay, but what happens

535
00:23:29,547 --> 00:23:31,247
after these people finish shooting up?

536
00:23:31,272 --> 00:23:32,592
We will provide a space

537
00:23:32,617 --> 00:23:34,536
where they can rest until
their high subsides...

538
00:23:34,561 --> 00:23:36,250
And what if they won't comply?

539
00:23:36,275 --> 00:23:37,832
- Mm.
- Exactly.

540
00:23:39,048 --> 00:23:40,476
Why don't we all just

541
00:23:40,501 --> 00:23:41,767
take a little recess,

542
00:23:41,792 --> 00:23:44,190
stretch our legs, get some coffee.

543
00:23:50,673 --> 00:23:51,997
I'm not getting through.

544
00:23:52,022 --> 00:23:54,379
I have an idea.

545
00:23:58,294 --> 00:24:00,275
So did you sort things out?

546
00:24:00,566 --> 00:24:02,076
I apologize for the wait.

547
00:24:02,101 --> 00:24:04,165
But yes, we were able to
figure out what happened.

548
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,460
At least in part.

549
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:07,518
But we ran the labs again,

550
00:24:07,689 --> 00:24:10,823
and Patrick is not Mazie's
biological father.

551
00:24:10,848 --> 00:24:13,129
What? This is ridiculous.

552
00:24:13,154 --> 00:24:14,577
Hang on. There's more.

553
00:24:14,602 --> 00:24:18,998
Layla, we went ahead and
karyotyped your blood sample

554
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,262
and found that you are not
Mazie's biological mother.

555
00:24:22,287 --> 00:24:23,559
Wait, what?

556
00:24:23,584 --> 00:24:25,186
I don't understand.
How is this possible?

557
00:24:25,211 --> 00:24:28,172
Sats are dropping!

558
00:24:28,197 --> 00:24:29,863
Take her off the vent and bag her.

559
00:24:29,888 --> 00:24:31,084
Hold on a second.

560
00:24:31,109 --> 00:24:32,903
If Mazie's not ours, then
who are her parents?

561
00:24:32,928 --> 00:24:33,934
We don't know.

562
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:35,426
We believe there must've been a mix-up

563
00:24:35,451 --> 00:24:36,561
at the fertility clinic.

564
00:24:36,586 --> 00:24:38,894
You were implanted with
another couple's embryo.

565
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:41,904
She's bradying down.
2 mills of atropine.

566
00:24:41,929 --> 00:24:43,404
Is she gonna be okay?

567
00:24:48,877 --> 00:24:50,264
Heart rate's coming back up.

568
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:51,893
Sats are improving.

569
00:24:51,918 --> 00:24:53,862
Call ped surgery. She
needs to go on ECMO.

570
00:24:53,887 --> 00:24:56,174
April, get in touch with
the fertility clinic.

571
00:24:56,199 --> 00:24:58,649
We need to track down Mazie's
biological parents right away.

572
00:24:58,674 --> 00:25:01,277
- What if we can't find them?
- One step at a time.

573
00:25:01,302 --> 00:25:03,270
We can just hope for the best.

574
00:25:03,295 --> 00:25:05,111
All right. Let's move.

575
00:25:07,478 --> 00:25:11,162
I've been asked to come and
share some thoughts with you

576
00:25:11,415 --> 00:25:13,784
about safe injection sites.

577
00:25:14,665 --> 00:25:18,199
My younger brother Tommy,
he played baseball.

578
00:25:18,414 --> 00:25:22,358
His talent was such that
he was being scouted

579
00:25:22,383 --> 00:25:24,550
by big Division I schools

580
00:25:24,575 --> 00:25:26,883
when he was just a
freshman in high school.

581
00:25:28,001 --> 00:25:30,600
But then, when he was around 15,

582
00:25:30,625 --> 00:25:33,460
he started to gravitate towards, um,

583
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:35,579
you know, not-so-great kids.

584
00:25:35,604 --> 00:25:38,271
He started to experiment
with drugs and alcohol,

585
00:25:38,481 --> 00:25:42,294
and he was hooked on heroin
by the time he was 17.

586
00:25:43,817 --> 00:25:45,692
There was a good stretch there

587
00:25:45,717 --> 00:25:47,798
where Tommy got himself healthy.

588
00:25:47,823 --> 00:25:49,905
You know, he got married, had a kid.

589
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:53,145
His... his arm was shot by then,

590
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:56,364
but he loved teaching his son the game.

591
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:58,899
And he was actually getting him ready

592
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:00,855
for Little League tryouts

593
00:26:00,944 --> 00:26:02,625
when he died...

594
00:26:03,303 --> 00:26:05,682
on the floor of his bathroom

595
00:26:05,707 --> 00:26:07,887
from a heroin overdose.

596
00:26:09,006 --> 00:26:11,150
My little brother was alone.

597
00:26:12,033 --> 00:26:15,254
I know this because I'm
the one who found him.

598
00:26:16,011 --> 00:26:20,875
And... and I was minutes...
Just minutes too late.

599
00:26:22,569 --> 00:26:25,924
The time that it took for Tommy to die

600
00:26:25,949 --> 00:26:28,593
from lack of oxygen to his brain

601
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,851
are why sites

602
00:26:30,876 --> 00:26:33,260
like Dr. Halstead is proposing today

603
00:26:33,812 --> 00:26:35,445
are so important.

604
00:26:35,643 --> 00:26:37,343
Because if he hadn't been alone,

605
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:39,651
if there had been somebody
there who had the tools

606
00:26:39,676 --> 00:26:41,902
and training to revive him...

607
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:47,262
Tommy could very well
still be alive today.

608
00:26:50,962 --> 00:26:52,748
Thank you for your time.

609
00:26:57,342 --> 00:27:00,562
I think I speak for all of us

610
00:27:00,587 --> 00:27:03,714
when I say that Dr. Charles, Dr.
Halstead,

611
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:06,370
you've made a very compelling case.

612
00:27:06,904 --> 00:27:09,881
And while the official
vote won't happen

613
00:27:10,054 --> 00:27:11,536
until we've reviewed

614
00:27:11,561 --> 00:27:13,895
the funding proposals for the quarter,

615
00:27:14,694 --> 00:27:17,170
I have a good feeling.

616
00:27:21,957 --> 00:27:24,491
Once we disconnect your
husband from life support,

617
00:27:24,618 --> 00:27:27,543
may be another few minutes
before his heart stops.

618
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,509
If you're sure...

619
00:27:30,744 --> 00:27:32,650
I would do anything to have Sam back,

620
00:27:32,675 --> 00:27:34,490
but he wouldn't want to live like this.

621
00:27:34,515 --> 00:27:35,747
Of course.

622
00:27:35,772 --> 00:27:36,976
I understand.

623
00:27:39,373 --> 00:27:42,440
Um, you would just need to
fill out a few documents,

624
00:27:42,465 --> 00:27:44,181
and then we can proceed.

625
00:27:46,096 --> 00:27:48,580
Can I just have a minute to read this?

626
00:27:48,605 --> 00:27:50,256
Please.

627
00:27:55,058 --> 00:27:56,850
What did the ethics committee say?

628
00:27:57,734 --> 00:27:59,349
They ruled in Michelle's favor.

629
00:27:59,374 --> 00:28:01,993
Oh, come on. There's got
to be some other recourse.

630
00:28:02,146 --> 00:28:03,678
There isn't.

631
00:28:10,732 --> 00:28:12,519
They're letting her pull the plug.

632
00:28:26,401 --> 00:28:28,067
Sam?

633
00:28:29,336 --> 00:28:31,298
All right, so I tan like an Irishman.

634
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,206
S... how are you... I...

635
00:28:35,231 --> 00:28:37,287
you were on the 6:00 a.m.
flight from Honolulu.

636
00:28:37,312 --> 00:28:38,771
Yeah, I was supposed to be,

637
00:28:38,796 --> 00:28:41,316
but I gave up my seat
for a later flight.

638
00:28:41,341 --> 00:28:43,742
You know, figured a few
extra hours in paradise

639
00:28:43,767 --> 00:28:45,029
never killed anyone, right?

640
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,712
Oh, no.

641
00:28:54,507 --> 00:28:55,791
Ethan?

642
00:28:56,552 --> 00:28:59,613
Dr. Choi!

643
00:28:59,638 --> 00:29:01,206
How long has he been asystolic?

644
00:29:01,231 --> 00:29:02,826
- Just under a minute.
- All right, start bagging him.

645
00:29:02,851 --> 00:29:04,301
What are you doing?

646
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:05,650
Dr. Choi, stop!

647
00:29:05,675 --> 00:29:07,232
I told you he doesn't want this!

648
00:29:07,257 --> 00:29:08,690
- Give him a milligram of epi!
- Dr. Choi!

649
00:29:08,715 --> 00:29:10,341
- You don't understand!
- Understand what?

650
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:14,823
Oh, my... oh, my God!

651
00:29:14,848 --> 00:29:17,253
- Oh!
- Dr. Abrams?

652
00:29:24,354 --> 00:29:26,830
All right, I feel a pulse. He's back.

653
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:29,329
Wow.

654
00:29:34,428 --> 00:29:35,828
Hey, Gwen?

655
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:40,368
Listen, I wanted to thank
you for your support.

656
00:29:40,958 --> 00:29:42,357
Oh, no need.

657
00:29:42,382 --> 00:29:44,275
Consider it a favor returned.

658
00:29:44,601 --> 00:29:45,934
Um,

659
00:29:45,991 --> 00:29:48,358
clearly there's been
a misunderstanding.

660
00:29:48,571 --> 00:29:52,359
My silence this morning was
not a bargaining chip.

661
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:54,875
Sharon, I understand
how the world works.

662
00:29:55,224 --> 00:29:57,779
No, no, I wanted you to have the space

663
00:29:57,804 --> 00:30:01,200
so you could tell your husband
the truth on your own.

664
00:30:02,523 --> 00:30:04,070
I can't do that.

665
00:30:04,095 --> 00:30:06,436
Gwen, I know you're in a tough spot...

666
00:30:06,461 --> 00:30:08,127
I can't lose my son.

667
00:30:18,034 --> 00:30:21,097
- That's our baby girl?
- I can't believe it.

668
00:30:21,511 --> 00:30:23,648
Patrick, Layla,

669
00:30:23,673 --> 00:30:26,690
this is Denise and Steve Bistarkey.

670
00:30:26,883 --> 00:30:28,814
Same last name as us.

671
00:30:29,614 --> 00:30:31,566
I've never met another Bistarkey.

672
00:30:31,591 --> 00:30:32,622
Us either.

673
00:30:32,647 --> 00:30:33,663
The clinic believes

674
00:30:33,688 --> 00:30:35,436
that's what may have caused the mix-up.

675
00:30:35,461 --> 00:30:37,046
Are you kidding me?

676
00:30:37,185 --> 00:30:38,977
How could they have let this happen?

677
00:30:39,253 --> 00:30:40,945
So does that mean...

678
00:30:41,447 --> 00:30:43,070
We don't know yet.

679
00:30:43,169 --> 00:30:44,891
We still have to determine

680
00:30:44,916 --> 00:30:47,042
if Denise was implanted
with your embryo.

681
00:30:47,067 --> 00:30:48,766
We'll also run labs to see

682
00:30:48,791 --> 00:30:51,295
if either of you are a
match to donate to Mazie.

683
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,938
Mazie?

684
00:30:52,963 --> 00:30:54,664
That's what we named her.

685
00:30:55,643 --> 00:30:57,787
I have an exam room ready.
I'll take you.

686
00:30:57,812 --> 00:30:59,652
I don't want to leave her.

687
00:31:00,199 --> 00:31:02,242
We'll stay with her till you get back.

688
00:31:02,582 --> 00:31:04,734
Thank you so much.

689
00:31:06,293 --> 00:31:08,044
Okay.

690
00:31:13,084 --> 00:31:14,606
Hey, hey, hey. Come on.

691
00:31:14,631 --> 00:31:16,307
Come on. It's okay.

692
00:31:17,681 --> 00:31:23,147
I am so, so sorry I didn't call, honey.

693
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:24,371
My cell phone died

694
00:31:24,396 --> 00:31:26,155
and I left my charger at the hotel.

695
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,160
You know, they do sell
chargers at the airport.

696
00:31:28,185 --> 00:31:30,281
I am not gonna shell out 30 bucks

697
00:31:30,306 --> 00:31:31,441
for a piece of plastic.

698
00:31:40,248 --> 00:31:42,414
They tracked down John Doe's family.

699
00:31:42,566 --> 00:31:44,427
Turns out he's a medical sales rep.

700
00:31:44,452 --> 00:31:46,956
That's why he had a
pass to the conference.

701
00:31:48,015 --> 00:31:49,621
You're not thinking about...

702
00:31:49,646 --> 00:31:50,936
I'm gonna tell Sam the truth.

703
00:31:50,961 --> 00:31:53,561
I think you should just leave it alone.

704
00:31:53,586 --> 00:31:55,697
He deserves to know who he married.

705
00:31:56,936 --> 00:31:58,354
Ethan.

706
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:00,847
You got a sec?

707
00:32:00,872 --> 00:32:02,902
Seeing as how I just
narrowly escaped death,

708
00:32:02,927 --> 00:32:04,058
yeah.

709
00:32:04,083 --> 00:32:05,833
I'd say I have a lifetime.

710
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:09,392
Okay, Sam...

711
00:32:10,411 --> 00:32:12,724
Michelle told us to unplug you.

712
00:32:13,949 --> 00:32:15,429
And?

713
00:32:17,216 --> 00:32:20,690
And she wouldn't even wait for
your daughter to get here.

714
00:32:20,715 --> 00:32:21,808
Well, thank God.

715
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:23,683
I'd hate for Lucy to
remember me like that.

716
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:25,332
I'm sorry, but...

717
00:32:26,439 --> 00:32:27,872
I didn't get the sense

718
00:32:27,897 --> 00:32:29,857
that Michelle had your
best interest at heart.

719
00:32:29,882 --> 00:32:31,240
Uh-huh.

720
00:32:31,265 --> 00:32:33,065
And what would make you think that?

721
00:32:34,491 --> 00:32:36,717
Ah, I get it.

722
00:32:37,264 --> 00:32:39,389
Maybe you're thinking the
only reason a woman like her

723
00:32:39,414 --> 00:32:41,489
would be with a guy like me is money.

724
00:32:42,067 --> 00:32:44,594
No, no, no. I didn't mean that at all.

725
00:32:44,619 --> 00:32:46,209
For your information,

726
00:32:46,234 --> 00:32:48,781
I'm the eye candy in this relationship.

727
00:32:49,875 --> 00:32:51,959
You ever hear of Max Amino Pro?

728
00:32:52,326 --> 00:32:54,187
The protein shake?

729
00:32:54,511 --> 00:32:56,848
Yeah, I drink it every day.

730
00:32:56,873 --> 00:32:59,435
Right, so does every fitness
freak in the country.

731
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,475
My wife invented the formula.

732
00:33:02,111 --> 00:33:03,709
Yeah.

733
00:33:03,734 --> 00:33:05,249
Cha-ching.

734
00:33:05,983 --> 00:33:07,934
Now, if you'll excuse me...

735
00:33:20,724 --> 00:33:23,156
- You lying bitch.
- Mark.

736
00:33:23,181 --> 00:33:24,996
You will never be alone
with our child again.

737
00:33:25,021 --> 00:33:26,365
- Please, please. Let me...
- No.

738
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:27,506
Let me explain.

739
00:33:27,531 --> 00:33:29,225
You'll be hearing from my lawyer.

740
00:33:29,836 --> 00:33:31,990
He was asking questions
and blaming himself.

741
00:33:32,015 --> 00:33:33,448
I had to tell him the truth.

742
00:33:33,473 --> 00:33:35,212
You had no right to insert yourself.

743
00:33:35,237 --> 00:33:37,788
- I am your baby's doctor.
- Do you see what you've done?

744
00:33:37,813 --> 00:33:39,478
- If I lose my son...
- Listen, Gwen...

745
00:33:39,503 --> 00:33:40,983
Sharon, this does not concern you.

746
00:33:41,008 --> 00:33:42,110
Actually, it does.

747
00:33:42,135 --> 00:33:43,766
I instructed Dr. Manning

748
00:33:43,791 --> 00:33:45,163
to be honest with your husband.

749
00:33:45,188 --> 00:33:47,460
- Ms. Goodwin, you don't...
- I confided in you.

750
00:33:47,485 --> 00:33:50,922
Lying to a minor's guardian?
Come on, Gwen!

751
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:53,154
It's too big of a liability.

752
00:33:53,179 --> 00:33:55,322
You wanna talk about liabilities?

753
00:33:56,192 --> 00:33:58,576
You can forget about
your little pet project.

754
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:01,807
Consider the safe injection site dead.

755
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:03,312
Really?

756
00:34:03,337 --> 00:34:06,106
You know, I actually thought

757
00:34:06,131 --> 00:34:08,209
that you and I made some strides today.

758
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,626
Me too.

759
00:34:16,121 --> 00:34:17,683
Ms. Goodwin, I'm sorry. I couldn't...

760
00:34:17,708 --> 00:34:20,630
There is no need for you to apologize.

761
00:34:32,704 --> 00:34:34,249
Hey.

762
00:34:34,797 --> 00:34:36,616
I just heard that the board passed.

763
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:38,947
I'm sorry. It was a valiant effort.

764
00:34:39,081 --> 00:34:40,835
I don't know what the hell happened.

765
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,331
They spouted some legalistic garbage

766
00:34:42,356 --> 00:34:43,858
in the rejection email.

767
00:34:43,883 --> 00:34:46,145
They're just, you know...
They're afraid.

768
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,774
Yeah, well, it doesn't matter.
There's another way.

769
00:34:50,799 --> 00:34:52,427
What do you mean?

770
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:58,492
Look, I wanna do this on the up-and-up,

771
00:34:58,517 --> 00:35:01,194
but if they're not gonna let me
spearhead it at the hospital,

772
00:35:01,552 --> 00:35:04,941
I got a friend who's got
something already in the works.

773
00:35:05,224 --> 00:35:07,837
You mean an unsanctioned site?

774
00:35:08,156 --> 00:35:09,689
You said it yourself.

775
00:35:09,714 --> 00:35:12,028
A site like this could've
saved your brother's life.

776
00:35:12,466 --> 00:35:14,404
I know how badly you wanna help,

777
00:35:14,429 --> 00:35:16,619
but, buddy, they're illegal.

778
00:35:16,947 --> 00:35:19,343
I mean, you could lose your license.

779
00:35:20,834 --> 00:35:23,514
Yeah. You're right.

780
00:35:23,977 --> 00:35:25,948
Thank you for your help today.

781
00:35:25,973 --> 00:35:27,527
Well, of course.

782
00:35:30,265 --> 00:35:31,923
And Dr. Charles...

783
00:35:33,457 --> 00:35:35,446
I'm sorry about your brother.

784
00:35:43,004 --> 00:35:45,825
After testing and
speaking with the clinic,

785
00:35:45,995 --> 00:35:49,125
we can confirm they
made a terrible mistake

786
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,695
and swapped your embryos.

787
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,501
Denise is carrying your baby.

788
00:35:52,526 --> 00:35:54,714
Thank God.

789
00:35:54,739 --> 00:35:56,722
Uh, what about Mazie?

790
00:35:56,891 --> 00:35:58,690
Steve is a donor match.

791
00:35:58,715 --> 00:36:01,113
- But I wasn't?
- Unfortunately, no.

792
00:36:01,377 --> 00:36:02,877
Don't worry.

793
00:36:02,902 --> 00:36:04,998
There are other options
to find a second donor.

794
00:36:05,023 --> 00:36:06,789
We're getting her on
the transplant list.

795
00:36:06,814 --> 00:36:09,094
Well, you said I'm a match, right?

796
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,850
You are, yes.

797
00:36:11,929 --> 00:36:13,394
Yeah.

798
00:36:13,419 --> 00:36:14,824
I'll do it. I'll donate.

799
00:36:14,849 --> 00:36:16,744
Oh, we can't ask that of you.

800
00:36:16,769 --> 00:36:20,134
No, no, you've done more
for us than you know.

801
00:36:21,508 --> 00:36:25,692
Besides, me and Mazie,
we've been through a lot.

802
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,697
And I know she isn't mine...

803
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,539
But I still love her like she is.

804
00:36:38,516 --> 00:36:41,451
Wow, what a crazy ride.

805
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:44,071
Like an IVF nightmare.

806
00:36:49,436 --> 00:36:50,936
Look at them.

807
00:36:52,902 --> 00:36:55,150
I'm guessing they'd do it all again.

808
00:37:07,973 --> 00:37:09,430
Listen, Crockett.

809
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:11,253
Yeah.

810
00:37:12,111 --> 00:37:14,875
You might've noticed I can
be a little quick to judge.

811
00:37:15,005 --> 00:37:16,604
I get it, man. You...

812
00:37:16,629 --> 00:37:17,888
were trying to do right by Sam.

813
00:37:17,913 --> 00:37:20,110
- It's all good.
- Not just with that.

814
00:37:21,984 --> 00:37:23,284
With you too.

815
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,303
Oh.

816
00:37:26,985 --> 00:37:29,045
- Well...
- Look, man.

817
00:37:29,764 --> 00:37:31,461
I made some assumptions about you.

818
00:37:31,486 --> 00:37:33,474
The truth is, I really don't know you.

819
00:37:34,298 --> 00:37:37,266
Appreciate the sentiment,
but you don't...

820
00:37:38,936 --> 00:37:40,570
You don't have to worry about it, man.

821
00:37:40,595 --> 00:37:42,844
- It's all good.
- Yeah, I do.

822
00:37:46,829 --> 00:37:48,195
Fresh start?

823
00:37:49,177 --> 00:37:50,996
Sure.

824
00:37:51,237 --> 00:37:53,460
- What's going on?
- Hey.

825
00:37:53,811 --> 00:37:55,987
Nothing, just saying good night.

826
00:37:56,012 --> 00:37:57,185
Oh.

827
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:59,241
Well, good night, Dr. Marcel.

828
00:38:00,761 --> 00:38:02,019
Good night.

829
00:38:05,143 --> 00:38:06,831
- Hi.
- Hi.

830
00:38:12,262 --> 00:38:14,427
- Ethan?
- Yeah?

831
00:38:14,452 --> 00:38:17,877
I want us to try to get pregnant again.

832
00:38:18,268 --> 00:38:19,768
Really?

833
00:38:19,793 --> 00:38:21,728
What if we give IVF a shot?

834
00:38:21,753 --> 00:38:24,426
Uh, I thought you didn't
want to go down that road.

835
00:38:24,451 --> 00:38:26,453
I know, I just...

836
00:38:27,269 --> 00:38:29,484
I was afraid.

837
00:38:30,199 --> 00:38:34,123
And IVF isn't a sure thing,
and given my condition,

838
00:38:34,148 --> 00:38:36,937
it's possible it may not even work,

839
00:38:36,962 --> 00:38:40,196
but there's a chance that it could.

840
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:44,661
It seems like it's worth the risk.

841
00:38:46,584 --> 00:38:48,684
- Right?
- Yeah.

842
00:39:01,658 --> 00:39:03,658
Nice, Matty. Don't
pinch your shoulders.

843
00:39:03,683 --> 00:39:05,486
It could cause elbow
problems down the road.

844
00:39:05,511 --> 00:39:06,774
Just ignore him.

845
00:39:06,799 --> 00:39:08,108
When Uncle Dan was your age,

846
00:39:08,133 --> 00:39:10,213
he was picking dandelions
in the outfield.

847
00:39:48,064 --> 00:39:49,630
Why the mirrors?

848
00:39:49,655 --> 00:39:51,984
It makes it easier for
the users to find a vein

849
00:39:52,009 --> 00:39:54,175
and helps us keep an eye on everybody.

850
00:39:58,587 --> 00:40:00,344
Where are you getting
the naloxone kits?

851
00:40:00,369 --> 00:40:02,022
I got a guy who's hooking us up.

852
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:04,238
There's a clinic that's
closing on the South Side,

853
00:40:04,263 --> 00:40:06,775
so we're getting them on the cheap.

854
00:40:08,342 --> 00:40:11,486
Anyway, what do you think?

855
00:40:17,616 --> 00:40:20,851
Yeah. I'm in.
