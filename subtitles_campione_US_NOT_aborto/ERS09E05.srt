1
00:00:03,513 --> 00:00:05,550
E. R.

2
00:00:05,651 --> 00:00:07,044
Previously on E. R.

3
00:00:07,045 --> 00:00:09,029
When you' re waiting
on a patient's results...

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:12,944
...it's not necessary for you to boff that
patient's mother in the storage closet.

5
00:00:13,045 --> 00:00:14,047
I'm so sorry, Robert.

6
00:00:14,148 --> 00:00:17,026
What, about my arm
or about not being there?

7
00:00:17,524 --> 00:00:19,326
- Memo from Weaver.
- What?

8
00:00:19,427 --> 00:00:21,178
I've made Abby the new nurse manager.

9
00:00:21,213 --> 00:00:23,375
The job is yours, like it or not.

10
00:00:23,476 --> 00:00:26,376
- Like it or not?
- I don't care to argue about it.

11
00:00:31,311 --> 00:00:33,301
E. R. 9x05 "A HOPELESS WOUND"

12
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:37,492
Duroziez's sign is a murmur when the
stethoscope is over the femoral artery.

13
00:00:37,527 --> 00:00:40,084
What's another sign?

14
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:40,999
- Weak pulse.
- No.

15
00:00:41,069 --> 00:00:42,860
- Poor cap refill?
- No.

16
00:00:43,029 --> 00:00:47,028
Those are both signs of shock.
It begins with Q. Anyone?

17
00:00:47,326 --> 00:00:49,484
- De Quervain's?
- No. That begins with a D.

18
00:00:49,662 --> 00:00:52,284
However, there is a Q in it,
so you' re getting warmer.

19
00:00:52,457 --> 00:00:55,458
Does Quincke's sign ring any bells?

20
00:00:56,295 --> 00:00:58,418
And it manifests itself how?

21
00:00:58,589 --> 00:01:00,416
With a visible...

22
00:01:02,176 --> 00:01:04,798
- Pulsation.
- Correct. Where?

23
00:01:05,305 --> 00:01:07,298
On the...

24
00:01:08,308 --> 00:01:10,301
- Neck.
- Navel?

25
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:12,803
Nail bed.

26
00:01:13,313 --> 00:01:17,394
Good night. Go home.
Rounds start at 7 a. m.

27
00:01:17,569 --> 00:01:20,985
Be sure to read Sabiston's chapter
on the acute abdomen.

28
00:01:21,156 --> 00:01:23,030
So much for the future of medicine.

29
00:01:23,201 --> 00:01:25,074
Jacy, be sure to ring Mr. Ingles.

30
00:01:25,244 --> 00:01:27,320
Remind him not to eat anything
after midnight.

31
00:01:27,497 --> 00:01:30,582
I don't want to have
to reschedule his hernia yet again.

32
00:01:30,751 --> 00:01:32,031
I'm going trick-or-treating.

33
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:34,084
- Oh, what's Ella this year?
- A cow.

34
00:01:34,255 --> 00:01:36,746
- Wasn't she a cow last year?
- No, she was Dorothy.

35
00:01:36,924 --> 00:01:42,345
I was the Cowardly Lion, and Mark-
Mark was the Scarecrow.

36
00:01:42,513 --> 00:01:44,341
Right.

37
00:01:44,975 --> 00:01:47,466
I get to be a farmer this year.

38
00:01:47,811 --> 00:01:49,354
Happy Halloween.

39
00:01:49,522 --> 00:01:51,349
- Dr. Corday.
- Yeah?

40
00:01:51,524 --> 00:01:54,360
Your med student called. Nathan.

41
00:01:54,986 --> 00:01:56,778
The one who didn't show up today?

42
00:01:56,947 --> 00:01:59,485
- He said he'd be here in a few minutes.
- Too late.

43
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:02,328
Dr. Romano would like to talk
with you before you leave.

44
00:02:02,495 --> 00:02:05,947
- Tell him you couldn't find me.
- I heard that.

45
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,124
Check this guy out.

46
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:14,167
- What the hell are you supposed to be?
- Want a candy, fellow?

47
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:17,011
Put some meat on those bones.

48
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:23,381
- Hi. I thought everyone was dressing up.
- We were supposed to. There was a memo.

49
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:25,968
- I didn't bring anything to change into.
- Nor did I.

50
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:28,223
You' re still a nurse.
You should've called.

51
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:30,606
Then I would be the only one.
I don't think so.

52
00:02:30,777 --> 00:02:33,732
- Frank, where's your costume?
- I don't observe pagan holidays...

53
00:02:33,906 --> 00:02:37,951
- ... that celebrate devil worship.
- Well, this is only for Satanists.

54
00:02:42,165 --> 00:02:44,621
- What? Shut up.
- It's kind of working for you.

55
00:02:44,793 --> 00:02:47,997
You give me an order I think
is wrong I'm gonna ask you to clarify.

56
00:02:48,171 --> 00:02:50,745
- Not in front of patients.
- I only questioned the dosage.

57
00:02:50,925 --> 00:02:52,918
- You made mistakes in the past.
- I have not.

58
00:02:53,095 --> 00:02:55,134
- Is there a problem?
- Yeah, you got no guts.

59
00:02:55,305 --> 00:02:57,048
- I'm not working with him.
- Why?

60
00:02:57,224 --> 00:03:00,558
- Because he treats nurses like idiots.
- If your boots fit...

61
00:03:00,728 --> 00:03:03,136
- Shoes.
- Whatever.

62
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,064
You' re wearing that for your shift?

63
00:03:05,233 --> 00:03:08,768
Yes. It's Halloween.
You know, Jerry sent out a memo.

64
00:03:08,945 --> 00:03:11,437
- Oh, naughty nurse.
- I'm not a naughty nurse.

65
00:03:11,615 --> 00:03:14,534
- I like it.
- No, I'm a- It's an old-fashioned nurse.

66
00:03:14,702 --> 00:03:18,286
- Looks naughty to me.
- So you're what, like, a kurva nurse?

67
00:03:18,456 --> 00:03:20,081
- What's that?
- How do you say...?

68
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,824
- A slut? You know, like a tramp, whore.
- Yeah, I got it.

69
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:28,627
You know, maybe I should've worn
that schoolgirl outfit you bought me.

70
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,379
She's making a joke.

71
00:03:34,224 --> 00:03:35,968
Cautery.

72
00:03:36,811 --> 00:03:38,720
Robert, what are you doing?

73
00:03:38,896 --> 00:03:40,770
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

74
00:03:40,941 --> 00:03:41,955
But you can't be.

75
00:03:42,135 --> 00:03:44,559
I had no choice.
Poor swine's full of stones.

76
00:03:44,737 --> 00:03:47,310
Oh, for heaven's sake. It's a pig.

77
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,482
I hope you' re not expecting me
to scrub in.

78
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:52,150
No, giving my hand a workout.
It's been five months.

79
00:03:52,328 --> 00:03:54,155
I gotta keep my skills up. Stapler.

80
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,913
Even with one arm I'm a better surgeon
than the hacks in this hospital.

81
00:03:58,085 --> 00:04:01,336
Robert, you' re not cleared to do surgery,
even on barn animals.

82
00:04:01,505 --> 00:04:04,839
Were you aware that Weaver
put through a proposal to hire PAs...

83
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,927
...to cover afternoon rounds
for post-call surgical residents?

84
00:04:08,096 --> 00:04:09,590
Yes. It was a very good idea.

85
00:04:09,765 --> 00:04:12,339
Not the point. The point is
nobody talked to me about it.

86
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:15,602
Last time I checked, I was head
of both surgery and this hospital.

87
00:04:15,771 --> 00:04:17,729
The Residency Review Committee-

88
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:21,518
Oh, sweet Mary and Joseph! Would you
look at the size of that gallbladder.

89
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:25,363
Jeez, you could feed a small
Amish family for a week with that thing.

90
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:29,317
I know Weaver's formed alliances with
the tribal elders while I was recuperating.

91
00:04:29,495 --> 00:04:32,033
- I expected more loyalty from you.
- Robert-

92
00:04:32,207 --> 00:04:35,042
Rewrite the proposal as if
it came from us. Keep me abreast...

93
00:04:35,211 --> 00:04:36,871
...of other covert Weaver ops. Okay?

94
00:04:37,045 --> 00:04:39,715
The last thing I need is Mata Hari
leading a palace coup.

95
00:04:39,924 --> 00:04:42,249
- What the hell?
- He's extubated.

96
00:04:42,427 --> 00:04:46,211
Get him back under. Hundred of Peridol.
Hold him down! Lizzie, hold him down!

97
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:49,463
- Bloody hell.
- He's a pig. Grab a loin, Lizzie!

98
00:05:40,112 --> 00:05:41,310
Flex.

99
00:05:41,489 --> 00:05:45,571
Flex. Keep going.
Ninety degrees. That's good.

100
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:48,782
Not my elbow I'm worried about.
What's going on down there? Brenda!

101
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:51,496
All right, the wrist.

102
00:05:55,632 --> 00:05:56,962
Flex.

103
00:05:57,177 --> 00:05:58,208
Keep going. A little bit more.

104
00:06:00,764 --> 00:06:03,470
- Ten degrees.
- Wrong. Check it again.

105
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:09,099
Ten.

106
00:06:09,777 --> 00:06:13,063
- It was 15 last week.
- Fluctuations are normal, Robert.

107
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:18,198
With this type of injury, you gotta
give yourself at least nine months.

108
00:06:18,537 --> 00:06:20,495
How does this affect my odds?

109
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:24,000
- You've still got a long way to go.
- Yeah, I know. The odds.

110
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:28,999
For full flexion, extension and
opposition of the digits, 20 percent.

111
00:06:29,177 --> 00:06:32,179
But even then, without radial
and ulnar deviation of the thumb...

112
00:06:32,348 --> 00:06:34,591
...I'm not sure
you'll be able to operate.

113
00:06:34,768 --> 00:06:37,604
But you can still be Chief of Staff.

114
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:39,979
Most of your job's
administrative anyway.

115
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,063
Thanks for the pep talk there, Marty.

116
00:06:50,872 --> 00:06:53,031
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Dr. Corday.

117
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,915
Yeah, aren't we all.
Are you a bill collector or a suitor?

118
00:06:56,087 --> 00:06:58,377
- Med student.
- Must be a slow learner.

119
00:06:58,549 --> 00:07:00,839
- Career change.
- Cowboy and fireman didn't work?

120
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:03,929
I'm supposed to start
my surgical rotation. I'm Paul Nathan.

121
00:07:04,098 --> 00:07:06,257
Dr. Romano.

122
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:11,355
- What happened?
- Tennis elbow.

123
00:07:11,524 --> 00:07:13,732
Fire at a Halloween party.
At least 30 victims.

124
00:07:13,903 --> 00:07:15,183
Gave 10 of morphine IM.

125
00:07:15,363 --> 00:07:17,402
- How you doing?
- Not good.

126
00:07:17,574 --> 00:07:18,903
- What's your name?
- Amy.

127
00:07:19,075 --> 00:07:22,078
- Last name?
- There was fire at the party downstairs.

128
00:07:22,246 --> 00:07:23,445
Your last name?

129
00:07:23,624 --> 00:07:26,198
- Anybody with her?
- Hard to say. The building's burning.

130
00:07:26,377 --> 00:07:29,414
- A lot of confusion.
- Soot in nostrils, intra-oral burns.

131
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:32,425
I need an intubation tray.
Get Corday on the crushed pelvis.

132
00:07:32,594 --> 00:07:33,792
- Excuse me.
- Not now.

133
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:37,007
Ed Jemena, 35. Full-thickness burns
to the hands and forearms.

134
00:07:37,183 --> 00:07:41,052
Guy was on fire. I tried to put him out.
I didn't have anything but my hands.

135
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,271
- Luka, can you get this?
- Yeah.

136
00:07:43,441 --> 00:07:44,853
- What's open?
- Curtain 2.

137
00:07:45,027 --> 00:07:46,770
- A trauma room.
- Lucky to get a bed.

138
00:07:46,946 --> 00:07:48,440
- Okay, yes?
- Oh, Paul Nathan.

139
00:07:48,614 --> 00:07:50,358
- Radiology?
- No. Surgery.

140
00:07:50,534 --> 00:07:51,779
- Resident?
- Med student.

141
00:07:51,952 --> 00:07:54,954
Good enough. Cellulitis to the leg
after a bug bite to the ankle.

142
00:07:55,123 --> 00:07:57,794
- What do I do?
- Mark the leading edge with a marker.

143
00:07:58,336 --> 00:08:00,293
Nice catch. Whoa, we' re full in here.

144
00:08:00,464 --> 00:08:02,457
- What do you have?
- Doctor, excuse me...

145
00:08:02,633 --> 00:08:04,709
You all need to stay
in your assigned spots.

146
00:08:04,886 --> 00:08:08,137
If a doctor or nurse can't find you,
it'll delay your treatment.

147
00:08:08,307 --> 00:08:11,724
Doctor, doctor, can you tell me
what's happened to my things?

148
00:08:11,895 --> 00:08:14,222
- My apartment's on the fourth floor.
- I'll see.

149
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:16,558
- The fire was on two.
- Will they let us go home?

150
00:08:16,735 --> 00:08:19,653
- Ask the fire department.
- How did it start? Was it a gas leak?

151
00:08:19,822 --> 00:08:22,149
- I'm sorry, I don't know.
- Carter, we need you.

152
00:08:22,326 --> 00:08:27,036
- Fruits upstairs were smoking dope.
- No one was smoking anything, all right?

153
00:08:29,502 --> 00:08:31,875
- What's that for?
- To keep an eye on the infection.

154
00:08:32,047 --> 00:08:35,382
- What are they giving him to stop it?
- Excuse me. Unasyn.

155
00:08:35,552 --> 00:08:38,589
- That'll get rid of the infection?
- It should. It's an antibiotic.

156
00:08:38,764 --> 00:08:40,390
- Hey, you a doctor?
- Med student.

157
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,682
I need that Mayo stand.

158
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,145
Put it under his arm.

159
00:08:45,315 --> 00:08:46,774
- Got this?
- I'm supposed to be-

160
00:08:46,942 --> 00:08:48,851
Good. I need a cutdown tray.

161
00:08:49,027 --> 00:08:50,736
What are you going to do?

162
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,742
- We' re gonna make you better.
- Why can't I feel my hands?

163
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,278
The burns have damaged
your nerves.

164
00:08:56,454 --> 00:08:58,412
Is it permanent?

165
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:00,954
I don't know.

166
00:09:01,127 --> 00:09:02,752
- Where's Terry?
- Who's Terry?

167
00:09:02,921 --> 00:09:05,709
My partner.
He's dressed like a jungle girl.

168
00:09:05,883 --> 00:09:07,877
- Etomidate's on board.
- I need to see Terry.

169
00:09:08,053 --> 00:09:11,008
Trauma panel, carboxyhemoglobin,
and ABG. Prime a line of ringers.

170
00:09:11,182 --> 00:09:13,852
- What is this?
- Rubber mask melted to the face.

171
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:18,307
- I can barely open the mouth.
- Try fiberoptic. I got the subclavian.

172
00:09:18,483 --> 00:09:21,769
- I thought you left, Lizzie.
- Supposed to be trick-or-treating.

173
00:09:21,946 --> 00:09:24,781
- Little old, don't you think?
- Open a crike tray in case.

174
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:28,236
- Guide wire's passing well.
- Pre-load an 8-0 tube on a scope.

175
00:09:28,413 --> 00:09:29,955
- Pulse ox down to 85.
- Fifteen blade.

176
00:09:30,123 --> 00:09:32,413
Ten-cc syringe.
Let's check the balloon.

177
00:09:32,585 --> 00:09:35,077
I need a different light source.

178
00:09:37,258 --> 00:09:40,046
Don't open the tray unless
the intubation fails. Don't want-

179
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:42,423
Sorry. Sorry.

180
00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:44,721
Got the line,
run the first liter wide open.

181
00:09:44,893 --> 00:09:46,007
Robert, you okay?

182
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:49,187
-0-silk, Neosporin, and OpSite.
- Robert?

183
00:09:50,066 --> 00:09:51,775
I'm okay.

184
00:09:52,153 --> 00:09:54,525
Keep bagging on 15 liters.
Get sats above 90.

185
00:09:54,697 --> 00:09:58,114
If you got this, Lizzie, I'm gonna go
check on the rest of the kids.

186
00:09:58,411 --> 00:10:00,285
- Take slow deep breaths.
- I'm trying.

187
00:10:00,455 --> 00:10:03,457
- Have you ever had asthma?
- No.

188
00:10:03,877 --> 00:10:06,748
- What's this?
- Smoke inhalation with wheezing.

189
00:10:06,922 --> 00:10:09,294
- Decreased breath sounds?
- Possible pneumothorax.

190
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:10,961
May need a chest tube.

191
00:10:11,136 --> 00:10:13,462
- Vitals?
- I've got it.

192
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:17,507
Yeah, I'm sure you do.
Get a chest x-ray and show it to me.

193
00:10:18,896 --> 00:10:20,438
Digital escarotomy.

194
00:10:20,606 --> 00:10:24,107
Yeah. He needs the same on the left.

195
00:10:24,654 --> 00:10:26,481
I agree.

196
00:10:32,038 --> 00:10:33,746
How old do you think she is?

197
00:10:33,915 --> 00:10:36,075
I don't know.

198
00:10:42,343 --> 00:10:43,886
Young.

199
00:10:44,472 --> 00:10:48,600
- Hey, Dr. Corday.
- Yeah? What have you got?

200
00:10:49,562 --> 00:10:51,720
Urine's 60 an hour. But it's bloody.

201
00:10:51,897 --> 00:10:55,102
Eighty percent burns. She'll need
12 liters in the first eight hours.

202
00:10:55,277 --> 00:10:58,279
Send out for CT abdomen and pelvis.
I still need to do an airway.

203
00:10:58,448 --> 00:11:00,108
- Dr. Corday?
- Yes?

204
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:04,080
I'm Paul Nathan. I was supposed
to begin my surgical rotation.

205
00:11:04,248 --> 00:11:05,707
Yes, you were.

206
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:08,951
She's got a critical patient next door.

207
00:11:10,046 --> 00:11:12,420
- Where should I put these?
- Here. Put them there.

208
00:11:12,591 --> 00:11:14,715
No free fluid.

209
00:11:14,886 --> 00:11:17,378
- Liver and spleen look okay.
- Scope is prepped.

210
00:11:17,556 --> 00:11:20,724
- Standing by with a number-five Shiley.
- Rounds started at 7 a. m.

211
00:11:20,894 --> 00:11:23,730
- No, I know. I was at my-
- Not interested in excuses, thanks.

212
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:25,524
- Get my letter?
- Let's take a look.

213
00:11:25,692 --> 00:11:29,276
- Dr. Corday, your nanny's on the phone.
- For God's sake. Take a look around.

214
00:11:29,447 --> 00:11:31,737
- Take a message.
- I did. She said to remind you...

215
00:11:31,909 --> 00:11:34,946
- ... she has a flight to catch at 10:30.
- I can't leave now, can I?

216
00:11:35,122 --> 00:11:37,577
- What do you want me to tell her?
- To bring Ella here.

217
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,328
Daycare's closed, you know.

218
00:11:39,502 --> 00:11:42,254
- I know.
- Pulse ox, 81.

219
00:11:42,422 --> 00:11:44,962
- He's throwing PVCs. Crike him.
- Anything I can do?

220
00:11:45,135 --> 00:11:47,127
Yes. Be quiet.

221
00:11:47,721 --> 00:11:49,929
Okay, bag him.

222
00:11:50,099 --> 00:11:53,101
You wanna make up for it?
Go out there and work up some patients.

223
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,730
- Yeah, but-?
- Wanna be a doctor?

224
00:11:54,898 --> 00:11:56,273
- That's why you' re here?
- Yes-

225
00:11:56,441 --> 00:11:59,359
Grab a patient, do an H & P.
Present the case to an Attending.

226
00:11:59,529 --> 00:12:03,609
I told Martin 100 times. You need to put
new batteries in the smoke detector.

227
00:12:03,784 --> 00:12:08,494
But, oh, no. God forbid
he should spend $3 on a 9-volt.

228
00:12:08,665 --> 00:12:11,335
The whole building could've
burned down.

229
00:12:11,502 --> 00:12:14,789
- His x-rays are back.
- Oh, okay. Good.

230
00:12:14,965 --> 00:12:17,422
- How's he doing?
- Better than most.

231
00:12:17,594 --> 00:12:19,800
- Yeah.
- Okay. Next time I go hiking...

232
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:23,092
- ... I'm wearing long pants.
- And bug repellent.

233
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,600
Your infection's spreading.

234
00:12:25,772 --> 00:12:28,263
- Is everything okay?
- I'll be right back.

235
00:12:28,608 --> 00:12:30,768
- Excuse me. You're a surgeon?
- That's the rumor.

236
00:12:31,028 --> 00:12:33,816
- Think there's something you should see.
- You're a student.

237
00:12:33,991 --> 00:12:38,155
- You haven't learned to think yet.
- I've got a rapidly spreading cellulitis.

238
00:12:38,622 --> 00:12:42,786
- Excuse me. How rapid?
- Well, I just drew this 20 minutes ago.

239
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,164
And look. This looks like sub-Q
air consistent with neck fash.

240
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,713
Yeah, nice catch.
Let's roll. Get that side.

241
00:12:48,884 --> 00:12:50,676
- We gotta move him upstairs.
- Upstairs?

242
00:12:50,846 --> 00:12:53,088
- To Surgery. What's he on?
- Three grams of Unasyn.

243
00:12:53,266 --> 00:12:55,971
Switch him to 6 million units
of pen G and 900 of clinda.

244
00:12:56,144 --> 00:12:58,019
- Where's he going?
- He caught a neck fash.

245
00:12:58,189 --> 00:12:59,600
- What?
- What's that mean?

246
00:12:59,774 --> 00:13:03,773
Your boyfriend may have necrotizing
fasciitis, a virulent skin infection.

247
00:13:03,946 --> 00:13:07,447
- They gave him antibiotics to help.
- The infection's spreading fast.

248
00:13:07,618 --> 00:13:08,898
Wait, what are you gonna do?

249
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:11,237
Take you to O. R.
and remove the infected tissue.

250
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:13,823
- What?
- Everybody off. Off the elevator.

251
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:16,078
Take the stairs next time.
You'll live longer.

252
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:19,251
If we don't stop this,
it'll move along and you'll develop...

253
00:13:19,425 --> 00:13:22,261
...an infection, which will
lower your blood pressure.

254
00:13:22,429 --> 00:13:24,553
You could die.

255
00:13:25,099 --> 00:13:26,891
Oh, my God.

256
00:13:30,064 --> 00:13:34,395
- Think we caught that in time?
- I hope so. Thank you. I'm Susan Lewis.

257
00:13:34,569 --> 00:13:36,030
Paul Nathan.

258
00:13:36,197 --> 00:13:38,903
- You coming?
- In a minute, yeah.

259
00:13:39,076 --> 00:13:41,746
- You okay?
- Yeah. It's just- It takes me a moment...

260
00:13:41,913 --> 00:13:46,876
...to get going sometimes.
I have Parkinson's disease.

261
00:13:51,849 --> 00:13:54,257
- Get up here.
- I'll be up in five minutes, Robert.

262
00:13:54,436 --> 00:13:55,716
You said that ten minutes ago!

263
00:13:55,896 --> 00:13:59,062
- I'm with a critical patient.
- Find somebody else now, Lizzie!

264
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:01,391
Good ET placement. No infiltrates.

265
00:14:01,568 --> 00:14:04,440
Check ABG, repeat CBC
and work on a burn-unit bed.

266
00:14:04,614 --> 00:14:05,859
- What about him?
- Who?

267
00:14:06,032 --> 00:14:09,069
- Him.
- Yeah. What about him?

268
00:14:11,581 --> 00:14:13,595
Pardon me.

269
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:17,329
I found your CPK,
lytes and UA results.

270
00:14:17,753 --> 00:14:19,793
You headed up to surgery
on the neck fash?

271
00:14:19,964 --> 00:14:21,922
Yes, as a matter of fact.

272
00:14:22,092 --> 00:14:27,086
- Okay. Well, I guess we' re done here.
- I am. You still owe eight hours.

273
00:14:27,389 --> 00:14:31,257
- I'm on rounds at 6 a. m.
- Welcome to Surgery.

274
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:40,730
Excuse me. Where can I find somebody
who was brought in?

275
00:14:40,904 --> 00:14:42,447
Admit.

276
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,231
Come here. Follow me.
Who are you looking for?

277
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:47,533
Wynn Mathison.
He's in a tiger costume.

278
00:14:47,704 --> 00:14:50,989
- There was a fire in our building.
- Could you direct me to the victims?

279
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,791
- Keep your habit on, man.
- Excuse me?

280
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,833
You'll soon see
your drag queen friends.

281
00:14:55,003 --> 00:14:58,004
I have food and housing vouchers
for the displaced.

282
00:14:58,173 --> 00:15:00,879
- Oh, I'm sorry, sister.
- Please tell me what room he's in.

283
00:15:01,052 --> 00:15:04,171
- What?
- He's with the guy in the tiger mask.

284
00:15:05,974 --> 00:15:07,255
Get some oil of wintergreen.

285
00:15:07,434 --> 00:15:10,470
I hate the smell of rotting flesh,
especially when it's increasing.

286
00:15:10,646 --> 00:15:12,306
Bacteria's moving faster than you.

287
00:15:12,482 --> 00:15:14,640
- Bovie.
- Systolic's down to 95.

288
00:15:14,817 --> 00:15:17,653
Bolus 500. Lap pad.

289
00:15:18,154 --> 00:15:20,230
Still not bleeding. Myonecrosis.

290
00:15:20,406 --> 00:15:22,032
- It's in the muscle.
- Ten blade.

291
00:15:22,201 --> 00:15:24,656
- If it's vascularized, don't cut it.
- That's my plan.

292
00:15:24,829 --> 00:15:28,162
Start there and carry the incision
four centimeters inferior.

293
00:15:28,332 --> 00:15:30,824
- No. That's eight. Goddamn it!
- We need clean borders.

294
00:15:31,002 --> 00:15:33,161
- Where the hell is Corday?
- In the scrub room.

295
00:15:33,338 --> 00:15:36,293
If I don't remove tissue,
the infection could be left to smolder.

296
00:15:36,466 --> 00:15:39,836
Get her. Maybe she can d�bride this
guy's wound without using a chain saw.

297
00:15:40,012 --> 00:15:42,136
- Hey!
- Kris, it's me. Elizabeth.

298
00:15:42,307 --> 00:15:44,465
Don't come.
I shouldn't be longer than an hour.

299
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:47,348
- Dr. Corday, he's asking for you.
- Be right there.

300
00:15:48,188 --> 00:15:51,024
Okay, but could you take Ella
to your house to finish packing?

301
00:15:51,274 --> 00:15:53,398
Yeah, I could pick
you both up after work.

302
00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:57,021
I could drive you to the airport,
save you the cost of cab fare. Yeah.

303
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:01,695
Okay. Thank you. Thank you so much.
Yeah. I'll see you soon.

304
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,910
Corazon, would you mind
taking the phone?

305
00:16:04,081 --> 00:16:05,741
Not at all.

306
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,377
Damn.

307
00:16:11,923 --> 00:16:13,750
Was that your wedding ring?

308
00:16:13,925 --> 00:16:16,214
Yep. Yeah.

309
00:16:17,888 --> 00:16:19,761
I can't see it.
Can you call Engineering?

310
00:16:19,932 --> 00:16:22,423
They' re closed till morning.
I'm sorry.

311
00:16:22,601 --> 00:16:26,932
- No, it's not your fault.
- Don't hate me. He wants to talk.

312
00:16:27,106 --> 00:16:30,227
- Lizzie, get your ass in here.
- I've lost my wedding ring.

313
00:16:30,402 --> 00:16:32,525
Oh, boohoo.
This guy's about to lose a leg.

314
00:16:32,696 --> 00:16:35,318
I'd say chop-chop,
but that'd be in extremely bad taste.

315
00:16:36,492 --> 00:16:38,865
Call someone,
get them to tape this off for me...

316
00:16:39,037 --> 00:16:41,362
- ... make sure no water's run down it.
- Sure.

317
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,326
Would somebody please call
Tiffany's search-and-rescue team?

318
00:16:44,501 --> 00:16:46,708
I'm coming!

319
00:16:46,878 --> 00:16:49,548
He's got 20 percent surface-area burns,
mainly upper body.

320
00:16:49,715 --> 00:16:52,385
- Oh, God.
- Decent prognosis.

321
00:16:52,552 --> 00:16:55,588
We provide ventilatory support until
lungs heal, then extubate him.

322
00:16:55,763 --> 00:16:57,472
Might take a week, maybe less.

323
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,349
What-? What about his face?

324
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:03,599
He'll need skin grafts.
There'll definitely be some scarring.

325
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:10,111
Wynn? Wynn, it's me, Terry.
I'm right here.

326
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,606
He can't hear you. He's sedated.

327
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:19,204
- You should have your eye looked at.
- Later, okay?

328
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:21,413
Can I touch him?

329
00:17:21,584 --> 00:17:23,376
I wouldn't.

330
00:17:26,173 --> 00:17:28,664
Yo, newbie. Come on.

331
00:17:31,762 --> 00:17:34,384
Check jungle perv's eye.
He may have a corneal burn.

332
00:17:34,557 --> 00:17:36,265
- Where's that?
- You still here?

333
00:17:36,434 --> 00:17:38,759
Yeah. Slit lamp.
Where is it? How does it work?

334
00:17:38,937 --> 00:17:41,689
Exam 3. Try the on-off switch.

335
00:17:42,107 --> 00:17:44,064
Hey, hey.

336
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,985
- You changed.
- I just put on scrub pants.

337
00:17:47,155 --> 00:17:52,493
Oh, come on. You know, Carter, my
outfit is really starting to bug me too.

338
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,783
- We agreed to stay in costume all shift.
- I am.

339
00:17:54,955 --> 00:17:57,031
No, you' re not. It's half a costume.

340
00:17:57,208 --> 00:18:00,078
- It's 50 percent commitment.
- Are you serious or kidding?

341
00:18:00,252 --> 00:18:03,005
- Do you know what I'm dealing with?
- Me too, in pumps.

342
00:18:03,173 --> 00:18:04,714
- Wanna see the whole costume?
- No.

343
00:18:04,882 --> 00:18:08,501
- That's all right. Forget it.
- I'm a skeleton. Look at me.

344
00:18:08,678 --> 00:18:11,300
- Carter really likes Halloween, huh?
- Perpetual erection.

345
00:18:11,473 --> 00:18:14,842
Drank his daughter's mandrake smoothie.
Police found him chasing women.

346
00:18:15,019 --> 00:18:17,475
- Where do you want him?
- In a cold shower.

347
00:18:17,647 --> 00:18:22,274
- Get a line in and push four of Ativan.
- Are you open, baby?

348
00:18:22,987 --> 00:18:24,185
Perfect.

349
00:18:25,655 --> 00:18:28,657
First-day labs, charcoal,
and a Foley for the tox screen.

350
00:18:28,826 --> 00:18:31,318
Release me.
I am the Marquis de Sade.

351
00:18:31,496 --> 00:18:33,785
How am I supposed to pass
a catheter through that?

352
00:18:33,957 --> 00:18:35,700
- Inject phenylephrine.
- Into the shaft?

353
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,204
I'm Rod Stewart.

354
00:18:37,377 --> 00:18:40,497
Won't hold still for a blood draw
much less let me touch his penis.

355
00:18:40,672 --> 00:18:43,674
- She can touch it.
- Or wait for the mandrake to metabolize.

356
00:18:43,843 --> 00:18:45,670
Why not give him Haldol?
Make it easier.

357
00:18:45,845 --> 00:18:47,174
Might make him worse.

358
00:18:47,514 --> 00:18:49,672
- Hey, hey.
- Hey. He just grabbed my ass.

359
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:52,341
- I couldn't reach hers.
- I said four of Ativan.

360
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,477
Ask Abby. I'm done.

361
00:18:55,648 --> 00:18:58,519
Okay. You could be
a little bit more sensitive.

362
00:18:58,693 --> 00:19:00,188
To what?

363
00:19:04,533 --> 00:19:07,320
- Amazing how quickly this spreads.
- Any idea how he got it?

364
00:19:07,495 --> 00:19:10,117
A cut, a scratch,
some other trivial injury.

365
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:13,825
- Dopamine's at 10 mics.
- More suction.

366
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:16,666
- Scalpel.
- Easy, Lizzie.

367
00:19:16,838 --> 00:19:19,412
Is it just me or is this
constant commentary distracting?

368
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:21,750
- It's not you.
- Just remove the infected tissue.

369
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:24,216
Let antibiotics and hyperbaric
oxygen do the rest.

370
00:19:24,388 --> 00:19:26,345
- You' re not serious.
- Hell, yes. I am.

371
00:19:26,515 --> 00:19:29,054
I'm in posterior compartment.
It's still necrotic soup.

372
00:19:29,227 --> 00:19:33,723
Six hours in a chamber will increase oxygen
saturation create a bacteriocidal effect.

373
00:19:33,899 --> 00:19:37,731
Give this guy a chance of a functioning
leg. You two have a problem with that?

374
00:19:39,489 --> 00:19:41,731
How's a guy with Parkinson's
get into med school?

375
00:19:41,908 --> 00:19:44,234
Probably some disability quota
they have to fill.

376
00:19:44,411 --> 00:19:46,284
Med school?
How's he expect to practice?

377
00:19:46,455 --> 00:19:49,906
- Don't want him taking out my appendix.
- He seems to have it under control.

378
00:19:50,084 --> 00:19:52,575
It's a progressive disease.
What about in 10 years?

379
00:19:52,753 --> 00:19:54,746
- Could be dead.
- Or wanna be.

380
00:19:54,922 --> 00:19:57,414
Happy, Abby.
Always looking on the bright side.

381
00:19:57,592 --> 00:19:59,051
I thought you were out sick.

382
00:19:59,219 --> 00:20:01,757
I was until an apartment fire
set us back 30 patients.

383
00:20:01,931 --> 00:20:04,505
- Thirty-five, counting bad popcorn balls.
- Wonderful.

384
00:20:04,683 --> 00:20:06,890
- Thanks for coming in.
- Shouldn't have answered.

385
00:20:07,061 --> 00:20:09,634
- Want your messages?
- No. I want the air conditioning on.

386
00:20:09,814 --> 00:20:11,938
- I'm sweating like a pig.
- It's freezing.

387
00:20:12,108 --> 00:20:14,480
That's what you get
bringing Weaver in on Halloween.

388
00:20:14,653 --> 00:20:16,445
- It's the biggest holiday for her kind.
- Lesbians?

389
00:20:16,614 --> 00:20:19,899
Wiccans.
Probably riding that crutch like a broom.

390
00:20:20,076 --> 00:20:23,279
Frank, all women get like that
when they' re going through the change.

391
00:20:23,454 --> 00:20:24,652
- Yeah, right.
- Pratt.

392
00:20:24,831 --> 00:20:27,453
What? She's having hot flashes.
She's moody.

393
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:29,951
- That is so sexist.
- And stupid. She's too young.

394
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:32,667
- Early onset.
- You've got early onset.

395
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,509
Whatever you say, Nasty Ratched.

396
00:20:36,386 --> 00:20:41,179
It's nurse, okay? Not nasty, not naughty,
not wet, certainly not had. Just nurse.

397
00:20:41,724 --> 00:20:44,976
- Abby, you' re gonna talk to Kovac, right?
- Yes.

398
00:20:45,146 --> 00:20:47,185
- County General on Bravo One.
- Rescue One...

399
00:20:47,356 --> 00:20:49,515
Finished the slit lamp,
numbed him with Alcaine.

400
00:20:49,592 --> 00:20:50,900
Who are you?

401
00:20:51,006 --> 00:20:53,773
Meet Nathan,
our newest, oldest med student.

402
00:20:54,573 --> 00:20:57,692
- I'm on surgical rotation with Dr. Corday.
- We have to clear Trauma.

403
00:20:57,868 --> 00:21:01,035
- BOA with newborn hypoxia.
- She asked that I stay and assist in-

404
00:21:01,205 --> 00:21:03,198
Good. Follow me.

405
00:21:03,499 --> 00:21:07,200
Don't worry. She doesn't bite. Much.

406
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,545
Simone Phillip, 42. Had a home birth.
Newborn in respiratory distress.

407
00:21:12,718 --> 00:21:16,419
- Did you have a complicated labor?
- No, it went well. I didn't even tear.

408
00:21:16,597 --> 00:21:18,839
One minute Apgar was seven.
But he had a little-

409
00:21:19,016 --> 00:21:20,262
- Who are you?
- The midwife.

410
00:21:20,435 --> 00:21:23,639
- What's wrong with him?
- We'll find out. Take him to Trauma 1.

411
00:21:23,813 --> 00:21:25,391
- Where is that?
- I'll take him.

412
00:21:25,566 --> 00:21:28,188
- No, I- It's okay.
- I got it. I got it. I got it.

413
00:21:29,195 --> 00:21:32,480
- Simone, you've lost a lot of blood.
- Something's wrong with my baby.

414
00:21:32,657 --> 00:21:34,484
Lily, stirrups. Gallant, labs.

415
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,993
- Maybe I should've had him in a hospital.
- You did everything right.

416
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:42,992
- CBC, PT, PTT, DIC screen for four units.
- We' re taking care of your baby.

417
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:45,839
- Let's help you now.
- BP's 80/60.

418
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:48,248
- Squeeze in another two liters.
- What's happening?

419
00:21:48,424 --> 00:21:50,168
Blood loss from a retained placenta.

420
00:21:50,343 --> 00:21:53,713
- No, I mean with my baby.
- Dr. Kovac is taking care of your son.

421
00:21:53,889 --> 00:21:59,395
I'm gonna pull gently on the umbilical cord.
Simone? I need you to stay with me.

422
00:22:02,565 --> 00:22:04,938
Pulse ox is 82. He's retracting.

423
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:08,479
Pedes intubation tray,
number three ET, uncuffed.

424
00:22:09,489 --> 00:22:11,233
What do you hear?

425
00:22:11,576 --> 00:22:13,153
Wet crackles throughout.

426
00:22:13,536 --> 00:22:14,734
Fluid in the alveoli.

427
00:22:14,954 --> 00:22:16,746
Okay, let's go look.

428
00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:23,419
Unhook the bag from the mask.
You can bag the ET once I'm in.

429
00:22:23,589 --> 00:22:26,341
- I've never done that.
- Squeeze the bag every two seconds...

430
00:22:26,509 --> 00:22:28,418
...just like he was doing.

431
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,508
Never pass the tube
till you see the cords.

432
00:22:34,601 --> 00:22:37,306
Okay. I'm in.

433
00:22:39,523 --> 00:22:42,939
Call for a Pedes vent.
And set me up for an umbilical line.

434
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:47,897
Relax, relax. The hard part's over.

435
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:53,157
Good.

436
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:57,120
Notify the NICU team.

437
00:22:57,668 --> 00:23:01,453
- What do I tell them's wrong?
- I have no idea.

438
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:04,336
It's no good. We' re into the cords.

439
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,998
- Have to do an AKA.
- Keep d�briding. We' re not there yet.

440
00:23:07,072 --> 00:23:08,671
We treat this conservatively
and it spreads...

441
00:23:08,765 --> 00:23:11,635
...then it's hip disarticulation
to stay ahead of bacteria.

442
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:14,348
- Worth the risk.
- Of his being non-ambulatory?

443
00:23:14,521 --> 00:23:16,847
Above-the-knee amputation.
He can use a prosthetic.

444
00:23:17,024 --> 00:23:20,108
If it gets to his hip, it'll spread
to the abdominal wall. He'll get septic.

445
00:23:20,277 --> 00:23:22,519
I'm trying to save this man's leg.
Dry the field.

446
00:23:22,697 --> 00:23:25,022
- What about his life?
- He's young. Same thing.

447
00:23:25,199 --> 00:23:26,943
Come on, Robert. Of course it's not.

448
00:23:28,245 --> 00:23:31,780
Look. This Kelly slices
through sub-Q fat like butter.

449
00:23:31,957 --> 00:23:34,080
Fine. Keep cutting
until you hit viable muscle.

450
00:23:34,252 --> 00:23:37,835
It's above the distal third of the thigh.
It's a hopeless wound.

451
00:23:44,305 --> 00:23:45,664
- Fine, take it.
- Robert.

452
00:23:45,739 --> 00:23:47,849
I said, take the leg.

453
00:23:51,354 --> 00:23:53,379
Bovie, pickups.

454
00:24:00,592 --> 00:24:03,000
Tommy, how are you feeling?

455
00:24:03,846 --> 00:24:06,136
He seems-
He seems a lot better, thanks.

456
00:24:06,391 --> 00:24:08,135
Good. Well...

457
00:24:08,311 --> 00:24:12,261
...just keep him on clear fluids tonight
and I'll have a nurse sign you out.

458
00:24:12,441 --> 00:24:13,687
Okay.

459
00:24:14,903 --> 00:24:18,985
- What's wrong with him?
- We'll- We'll talk about it later.

460
00:24:34,929 --> 00:24:38,631
- How are you holding up?
- Good. I think the robot can go home.

461
00:24:38,893 --> 00:24:42,145
- Okay. I'll get Carter to dispo him.
- Okay.

462
00:24:44,276 --> 00:24:47,562
- Can I get you a cup of coffee?
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.

463
00:24:48,615 --> 00:24:50,407
I like your outfit.

464
00:24:50,577 --> 00:24:51,952
It's very retro.

465
00:24:54,373 --> 00:24:56,117
Thank you.

466
00:24:58,504 --> 00:25:02,170
Listen, if-
If you ever need anything, like a...

467
00:25:02,342 --> 00:25:04,134
Like a straitjacket?

468
00:25:08,976 --> 00:25:12,263
Is your dyskinesia usually this bad?

469
00:25:12,606 --> 00:25:15,643
I don't wanna freeze up on them
at work so I upped the medication.

470
00:25:15,819 --> 00:25:17,194
And this is what you get.

471
00:25:17,571 --> 00:25:19,398
At least it helps to dispel the myth.

472
00:25:20,701 --> 00:25:23,703
You know, we don't all have rhythm.

473
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:30,086
If it happened to me, I'd probably jump
on a world cruise, not go to med school.

474
00:25:30,255 --> 00:25:31,880
I already saw the world.

475
00:25:32,049 --> 00:25:35,799
In fact, I was in Italy
when I first realized I had a problem.

476
00:25:36,013 --> 00:25:40,593
Sipping wine in this caf� in Florence,
and I noticed my little finger shaking.

477
00:25:40,769 --> 00:25:44,436
I just figured it was from living
on espresso and martinis.

478
00:25:44,608 --> 00:25:46,269
When did you find out it wasn't?

479
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:50,313
Well, I used to hate doctors
so it took a while for me to check it out.

480
00:25:50,491 --> 00:25:54,359
But once I did,
it really put things in perspective.

481
00:25:55,665 --> 00:25:57,788
Yeah, I guess being sick does that.

482
00:25:57,959 --> 00:26:01,460
- Her baby's not doing well, huh?
- No.

483
00:26:03,133 --> 00:26:05,091
- How are you doing, Simone?
- Good.

484
00:26:05,261 --> 00:26:06,637
He seems better, huh?

485
00:26:06,805 --> 00:26:09,724
Maintenance fluids
are at five cc's per kilo per hour.

486
00:26:09,893 --> 00:26:14,022
My mother had me at home.
I thought it would be good for him.

487
00:26:15,192 --> 00:26:17,231
His tests came back.

488
00:26:17,402 --> 00:26:22,114
I'm afraid your baby
has a disease called sialidosis.

489
00:26:22,285 --> 00:26:24,158
What's that?

490
00:26:29,711 --> 00:26:34,837
His body lacks an enzyme that breaks
down the waste proteins inside the cells.

491
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:40,599
And there is already extensive damage
to the liver, bones and nervous system.

492
00:26:47,527 --> 00:26:52,356
I've been staring at him
for over an hour now.

493
00:26:52,533 --> 00:26:57,696
And I still can't figure out
what I wanna call him.

494
00:27:00,712 --> 00:27:03,382
Would you excuse us, please?

495
00:27:05,343 --> 00:27:07,882
Yeah. Sure.

496
00:27:14,564 --> 00:27:20,500
Children with sialidosis
are mentally retarded, often blind.

497
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:23,909
He'll never speak or walk.

498
00:27:24,577 --> 00:27:27,116
His life expectancy
is less than two years.

499
00:27:29,042 --> 00:27:31,960
Dr. Kovac, NICU is on line one.

500
00:27:32,129 --> 00:27:34,503
Thanks.

501
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,595
Excuse me.

502
00:27:53,283 --> 00:27:55,324
Is there anyone you'd like me to call?

503
00:27:58,415 --> 00:28:00,159
No.

504
00:28:00,334 --> 00:28:02,375
There's just us.

505
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:08,755
I don't think it'll be necessary.
Thank you.

506
00:28:10,139 --> 00:28:13,225
- You having a bad night?
- No worse than usual.

507
00:28:13,393 --> 00:28:15,303
That was a little bit insensitive.

508
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,936
I had to tell a mother
her baby was gonna die.

509
00:28:18,109 --> 00:28:21,146
- I didn't need an audience? Okay?
- Okay.

510
00:28:22,364 --> 00:28:24,488
I'm starting to get some complaints
about you.

511
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:27,116
- From patients?
- Nurses.

512
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,780
Don't look so concerned about it.

513
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:34,578
First you accused Chuny of being an
idiot. When she's sexually harassed...

514
00:28:34,756 --> 00:28:37,331
- ... you practically laughed.
- The guy grabbed her butt.

515
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:40,180
- Yeah, that's sexual harassment.
- Come on. You were there.

516
00:28:40,347 --> 00:28:42,922
The guy's intoxicated with mandrake.
He's harmless.

517
00:28:43,101 --> 00:28:44,762
- This one's all yours.
- What patient?

518
00:28:44,937 --> 00:28:47,642
Mr. Hard-On. Checking his vitals
and he grabbed my boob.

519
00:28:47,816 --> 00:28:50,023
- What's his status?
- Gonna die if he tries again.

520
00:28:50,194 --> 00:28:51,439
- That's his status.
- See?

521
00:28:51,613 --> 00:28:53,606
Every time there's a problem,
she complains.

522
00:28:53,781 --> 00:28:55,526
Everyone complains.
It's part of the job.

523
00:28:55,701 --> 00:28:58,704
Yes. And it's part of my job
as nurse manager to counsel you.

524
00:28:58,873 --> 00:29:00,071
What?

525
00:29:00,249 --> 00:29:02,539
You can give nurses orders,
but cannot critique.

526
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:05,381
If you have a problem
with a nurse, come to me.

527
00:29:05,548 --> 00:29:08,550
Okay. What about you? Who do I
complain to if I have a problem-?

528
00:29:08,719 --> 00:29:11,721
Here's an idea. Maybe you
should try fighting for the nurses...

529
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:15,307
- ... instead of fighting with them.
- Maybe you should sew swastikas...

530
00:29:15,478 --> 00:29:18,895
...on that costume. You could be
a naughty Nazi nurse, huh?

531
00:29:20,318 --> 00:29:25,480
- You totally suck, you know that?
- Creating a hostile work environment.

532
00:29:25,658 --> 00:29:27,699
- Where's Dr. Kovac?
- I don't know. Page him.

533
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:30,243
The baby with sialidosis
is febrile to 102.

534
00:29:30,415 --> 00:29:34,000
- Chuny, where's Kovac?
- Don't know, don't care.

535
00:29:34,171 --> 00:29:36,841
- Feels like he's on fire.
- Why hasn't he gone to the NICU?

536
00:29:37,007 --> 00:29:39,629
- You'd have to ask Dr. Kovac.
- Can you do something?

537
00:29:39,803 --> 00:29:42,259
He needs to be pan-cultured.
How much does he weigh?

538
00:29:42,432 --> 00:29:46,051
- Three kilos.
- A hundred and fifty milligrams IV...

539
00:29:46,229 --> 00:29:50,607
...piggyback of Cefotaxime and amp.
Set up for a spinal tap.

540
00:29:51,068 --> 00:29:53,774
- He has sialidosis.
- Yeah. And he also has an infection.

541
00:29:53,947 --> 00:29:55,146
Sixty mgs of Tylenol.

542
00:29:55,324 --> 00:29:58,492
I'll arrange for your baby
to be sent up to the neonatal unit.

543
00:29:58,662 --> 00:30:01,415
- We'll do everything we can for you.
- Thank you.

544
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:12,134
Why are you still here?

545
00:30:13,139 --> 00:30:14,800
My piano recital was canceled.

546
00:30:14,975 --> 00:30:18,642
Hey, it's me, Elizabeth. I'm on my way
home now. See you soon. Bye.

547
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:25,273
We did the right thing.

548
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:27,821
You trying to convince me or you?

549
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:31,414
I went through
a period of adjustment...

550
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:34,538
...when I became a mother,
every time I treated a child.

551
00:30:34,711 --> 00:30:35,956
You get over it.

552
00:30:36,129 --> 00:30:39,085
Oh, please spare me
the $2 psychoanalysis, Lizzie.

553
00:30:39,801 --> 00:30:43,551
- Fine.
- Hey, look, look.

554
00:30:46,977 --> 00:30:51,107
I know most people don't like me.
I don't care. I don't like most people.

555
00:30:54,363 --> 00:30:56,855
But I'm good at what I do.

556
00:30:58,285 --> 00:31:02,154
I save people's lives every day.

557
00:31:02,874 --> 00:31:05,829
People who no one else can help.

558
00:31:11,385 --> 00:31:13,545
If I can't do that...

559
00:31:29,911 --> 00:31:31,655
Robert...

560
00:31:32,414 --> 00:31:34,823
...I know you' re frustrated.

561
00:31:37,255 --> 00:31:42,464
You' re an excellent surgeon, and you
will be again. I promise you. You will be.

562
00:31:49,772 --> 00:31:53,189
- I'm being paged.
- Elizabeth.

563
00:31:54,987 --> 00:31:56,779
I'm being paged.

564
00:32:06,294 --> 00:32:08,786
- Elizabeth.
- I just tried calling you.

565
00:32:08,964 --> 00:32:11,503
I'm sorry. I have to leave
for the airport now.

566
00:32:11,676 --> 00:32:13,800
- What about the later flight?
- This is it.

567
00:32:13,971 --> 00:32:16,842
I threw her pajamas, some crackers,
a couple toys in here...

568
00:32:17,017 --> 00:32:19,307
...in case she had to stay for a while.
I'm sorry.

569
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,768
No. It's all right. It's my fault.
We got slammed.

570
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,482
I'll see you Monday morning.

571
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,024
- Yeah, yeah. Have a safe flight.
- Okay. Bye, Ella.

572
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:28,355
Hey, did Kris
take you trick-or-treating?

573
00:32:30,285 --> 00:32:33,157
- What is it?
- Dropped her pressure to 60 palp.

574
00:32:33,331 --> 00:32:36,416
Dopamine is up. We got two liters.
I'm working on an art line.

575
00:32:36,585 --> 00:32:39,540
- Any word from her family?
- No. We don't have her last name.

576
00:32:39,714 --> 00:32:41,672
- Lily, could you?
- Oh, sure.

577
00:32:41,842 --> 00:32:43,586
- There, it's okay.
- Hello, little cow...

578
00:32:43,762 --> 00:32:46,680
- ... girl.
- I'll be with you soon, all right?

579
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:49,307
- Could it be hemorrhagic?
- The CT was negative.

580
00:32:49,478 --> 00:32:51,186
I'm thinking hypoxia.

581
00:32:51,356 --> 00:32:53,929
If we don't find her family,
they'll be ID'ing the body.

582
00:32:54,109 --> 00:32:56,233
Pulse ox is only 82 on 100 percent.

583
00:32:56,404 --> 00:32:58,562
She needs suctioning, Abby.
Set up ultrasound.

584
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:01,945
- She may have blown a clot.
- I don't know. Second crit was only 32.

585
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:04,362
- What happened to Mom?
- In the washroom.

586
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:07,707
- Where are the suction catheters?
- Try the cabinet.

587
00:33:07,877 --> 00:33:10,714
- What are you doing?
- Weaver ordered antibiotics.

588
00:33:10,881 --> 00:33:14,169
- No. Who did the LP?
- She wanted a full septic workup.

589
00:33:14,344 --> 00:33:17,051
- This is my patient.
- The baby spiked a fever.

590
00:33:17,224 --> 00:33:19,715
This baby
is in a chronic vegetative state.

591
00:33:19,894 --> 00:33:22,267
You' re prolonging his
and the mother's suffering.

592
00:33:22,439 --> 00:33:24,896
- We treat kids like this.
- You should've asked me.

593
00:33:25,067 --> 00:33:28,153
- We couldn't find you.
- I told you to leave. This isn't your case.

594
00:33:28,322 --> 00:33:29,901
- Luka.
- Abby?

595
00:33:30,075 --> 00:33:32,317
Check with me before you push meds
on my patient.

596
00:33:32,494 --> 00:33:34,821
- I have to do a cutdown here.
- Morrison's pouch looks dry.

597
00:33:34,998 --> 00:33:38,368
It could be retroperitoneal.
What the hell was all that about?

598
00:33:38,545 --> 00:33:41,416
- You want PEEP on the vent?
- Not until we get her pressure up.

599
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:44,261
Nathan, why do you think
she's hypotensive?

600
00:33:44,427 --> 00:33:46,337
- Blood loss?
- Not in this case.

601
00:33:46,513 --> 00:33:49,267
Hypoxia can cause
myocardial dysfunction.

602
00:33:49,435 --> 00:33:51,060
I'm filing a grievance against him.

603
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:53,850
Not now, Chuny. IV's dry.
She needs a fresh one.

604
00:33:54,608 --> 00:33:57,396
- I'll get it.
- Panic value. Potassium is 8. 2.

605
00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:01,320
Damn. Rhabdo from the crush injury.
Ten cc's of calcium gluconate.

606
00:34:01,492 --> 00:34:03,153
- PVCs.
- Let's push bicarb.

607
00:34:03,328 --> 00:34:05,487
Ten units of regular insulin
and an amp of D50.

608
00:34:05,664 --> 00:34:09,414
Get me Kayexalate and call Renal.
She may need dialysis.

609
00:34:10,547 --> 00:34:13,465
- What the hell are you doing?
- I accidentally-

610
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,045
It's okay.

611
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:18,680
- Go see if Frank's found the girl's family.
- I'll start another.

612
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:20,890
- Transducer ready?
- Where's the saline?

613
00:34:21,061 --> 00:34:23,599
- I said, go find the girl's family.
- Run of five.

614
00:34:23,772 --> 00:34:26,312
- Hundred of lidocaine. Prep the groin.
- Pressure falling, 79.

615
00:34:26,485 --> 00:34:28,810
Pressure's down to 50.

616
00:34:29,447 --> 00:34:32,864
- Being a little hard on him, you think?
- V-tach. Charge to 200.

617
00:34:33,035 --> 00:34:36,405
- What are you talking about?
- He's doing a good job, considering.

618
00:34:36,582 --> 00:34:39,204
- Considering what?
- He has Parkinson's.

619
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:40,955
Excuse me?

620
00:34:43,424 --> 00:34:45,133
Clear.

621
00:34:45,511 --> 00:34:47,338
Still V-tach.

622
00:34:47,514 --> 00:34:52,260
- Procainamide's onboard.
- Stand by with amiodarone. Clear.

623
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:57,942
- No change.
- How long?

624
00:34:58,111 --> 00:35:00,484
- How long?
- Twelve minutes.

625
00:35:00,656 --> 00:35:02,483
Clear.

626
00:35:05,663 --> 00:35:07,288
- Sinus tach.
- All right.

627
00:35:07,457 --> 00:35:09,082
Way to go.

628
00:35:09,251 --> 00:35:13,381
- Good femoral pulse.
- Set up a Pronestyl drip then a repeat K.

629
00:35:14,633 --> 00:35:17,470
Labs on your baby.

630
00:35:18,305 --> 00:35:20,844
- Thank you.
- Glad to see you two have made up.

631
00:35:21,017 --> 00:35:24,222
Hey, I'm being professional
and she's the one having trouble.

632
00:35:24,397 --> 00:35:27,565
- I warned her.
- Warned her about what?

633
00:35:28,151 --> 00:35:29,813
Nothing.

634
00:35:30,989 --> 00:35:33,563
Oh, my God.

635
00:35:34,869 --> 00:35:37,242
- You' re such a jerk.
- What?

636
00:35:37,414 --> 00:35:39,491
You slept with her?

637
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:42,832
That's what this is all about.
What's your problem?

638
00:35:43,089 --> 00:35:45,213
- Hey, one time.
- One time. One time with Chuny.

639
00:35:45,384 --> 00:35:47,508
One time with a patient's mother
in Radiology.

640
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:49,837
Hey, you never complained.

641
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:54,222
I never let it affect my work.
You two need to figure this out.

642
00:35:54,438 --> 00:35:56,976
- So what do you want me to do?
- Tell her you' re sorry.

643
00:35:57,149 --> 00:36:00,104
- Tell her it was wrong. Just fix it.
- I'm not gonna kiss her ass.

644
00:36:00,278 --> 00:36:01,738
That's how this problem started.

645
00:36:02,281 --> 00:36:05,698
- Have them check a gas on 50 percent.
- I'm gonna wait right here for you.

646
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:07,994
Don't worry about anything.

647
00:36:09,374 --> 00:36:11,249
I love you.

648
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:14,538
I should've told them
I was his brother.

649
00:36:14,715 --> 00:36:17,041
ICU has strict rules.

650
00:36:17,386 --> 00:36:21,550
He'll need round-the-clock attention
tonight, but his lungs are rebounding.

651
00:36:23,769 --> 00:36:27,186
You know what? You should go home.
They'll let you see him in the morning.

652
00:36:27,357 --> 00:36:28,768
Home?

653
00:36:29,485 --> 00:36:31,644
Our whole lives
were in that apartment.

654
00:36:32,281 --> 00:36:34,773
This dress is all I have.

655
00:36:43,546 --> 00:36:45,540
I've been watching his heart rate.

656
00:36:45,715 --> 00:36:49,797
It goes down when I touch him
when he knows I'm here.

657
00:36:51,932 --> 00:36:56,181
- Has his fever gone down?
- A little.

658
00:36:58,817 --> 00:37:02,269
I waited so long for him.

659
00:37:02,781 --> 00:37:04,858
Five years.

660
00:37:05,033 --> 00:37:07,110
Two miscarriages, in vitro.

661
00:37:07,286 --> 00:37:12,627
I lost two boyfriends because
I was so determined to have a child.

662
00:37:12,794 --> 00:37:15,120
I was about to give up.

663
00:37:15,465 --> 00:37:17,873
And then suddenly...

664
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:20,675
...he was here.

665
00:37:20,888 --> 00:37:23,760
- He's here.
- We'll keep treating the infection...

666
00:37:23,934 --> 00:37:26,640
...but he will start
going into organ failure soon.

667
00:37:26,813 --> 00:37:29,519
His systems will shut down.

668
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:37,326
You' re so beautiful.

669
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,327
You' re my baby.

670
00:37:40,498 --> 00:37:42,575
His heart could stop beating.

671
00:37:43,336 --> 00:37:47,205
I need to know what you wanna do
if something like that happens.

672
00:37:48,134 --> 00:37:50,211
I don't know.

673
00:37:51,096 --> 00:37:56,519
To keep him alive, I may have to open
his chest, maybe even shock him.

674
00:37:57,564 --> 00:38:01,514
And I'm not sure you want me
to do something like that.

675
00:38:02,362 --> 00:38:04,106
No.

676
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,236
I don't know.

677
00:38:10,873 --> 00:38:12,866
I don't know.

678
00:38:13,126 --> 00:38:15,001
Tell the unit I flushed the Quinton.

679
00:38:15,171 --> 00:38:16,831
He's tenacious.
Gotta give him that.

680
00:38:17,007 --> 00:38:18,418
I wish he'd told me.

681
00:38:18,592 --> 00:38:20,669
Not an easy thing to lead with.

682
00:38:24,975 --> 00:38:26,351
There's Mommy.

683
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:28,228
There's Mommy.

684
00:38:29,232 --> 00:38:32,067
Hi, Lily had to run Wynn's ABG
up to the lab.

685
00:38:32,235 --> 00:38:34,359
- Thank you.
- Did you reverse her hyperkalemia?

686
00:38:34,531 --> 00:38:37,651
Yeah. Enough to get her to dialysis.
She still has the burns though.

687
00:38:37,827 --> 00:38:39,487
- Yeah. But you got her back.
- May I?

688
00:38:39,662 --> 00:38:41,904
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Hey.

689
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:44,993
Thank you.
So did we reach the parents?

690
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:48,457
No. The girl was actually babysitting.
It wasn't even her building.

691
00:38:48,633 --> 00:38:52,762
You might've told me sooner, saved me
embarrassment about your condition.

692
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:55,387
Well, I certainly didn't mean
to embarrass you.

693
00:38:55,559 --> 00:38:57,434
- How long has it been?
- Eight years.

694
00:38:57,604 --> 00:38:59,431
I was misdiagnosed for the first two.

695
00:38:59,606 --> 00:39:03,854
- And you were late today because?
- My neurologist wanted an MRI.

696
00:39:04,904 --> 00:39:06,898
I'm sorry.

697
00:39:07,868 --> 00:39:10,240
I wouldn't have made you stay.

698
00:39:11,122 --> 00:39:13,448
What the hell? Fresh start.

699
00:39:13,625 --> 00:39:16,912
Try to make as many rounds as you can,
complete the required reading...

700
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:18,417
...take the exam.

701
00:39:18,591 --> 00:39:22,210
I've been reading and taking tests for
two years. This is my hands-on training.

702
00:39:22,387 --> 00:39:24,463
- It's a surgical rotation.
- I understand that.

703
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:30,312
Probably the most physically demanding
emotionally exhausting, stressful six weeks,

704
00:39:30,481 --> 00:39:32,605
...any would-be physician
ever experiences.

705
00:39:32,777 --> 00:39:35,315
Part of becoming a doctor.

706
00:39:35,488 --> 00:39:38,858
I'm offering you a pass, Mr. Nathan.
Trust me. You should take it.

707
00:39:39,285 --> 00:39:40,994
I'm here to treat patients.

708
00:39:41,163 --> 00:39:42,622
You have a degenerative disease.

709
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:46,041
I know what I have.
It doesn't mean I need a pass.

710
00:39:47,421 --> 00:39:48,999
ER.

711
00:39:50,175 --> 00:39:53,676
I don't want special treatment.
I just want to learn like other students.

712
00:39:54,096 --> 00:39:56,423
- Yeah, she's here.
- You're not like other students.

713
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:00,516
- No, I'm older and smarter.
- Okay. Dr. Corday, burn unit needs you.

714
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:04,854
- I'm on my way up, Frank.
- It's your melted-mask guy.

715
00:40:06,363 --> 00:40:08,522
Okay. Be right there.

716
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:12,699
- She's on her way.
- Look, go home, think about it...

717
00:40:12,873 --> 00:40:15,328
...report back day after tomorrow.
Use the rest.

718
00:40:15,501 --> 00:40:18,539
- I'm fine.
- It's just not very practical.

719
00:40:19,298 --> 00:40:21,375
Okay, let's go.

720
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:31,393
- Dr. Weaver?
- What?

721
00:40:31,982 --> 00:40:33,560
- What time is it?
- Are you okay?

722
00:40:33,734 --> 00:40:36,024
Yeah. Yeah, I was-

723
00:40:36,196 --> 00:40:39,151
- I was gonna lay down for a second.
- Can you pronounce a patient?

724
00:40:39,325 --> 00:40:41,614
Did we ever hear back from the NICU?

725
00:40:42,412 --> 00:40:45,367
- No. There was no need.
- Oh, come on. It's been three hours.

726
00:40:45,542 --> 00:40:47,416
We can't board their patients.

727
00:40:47,586 --> 00:40:50,161
They have to call in a nurse from home.
If they won't...

728
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:53,508
- ... I'll speak to their medical director.
- Dr. Weaver...

729
00:40:55,431 --> 00:40:58,100
Cardiac arrest a half-hour ago.

730
00:40:59,227 --> 00:41:00,603
Excuse us.

731
00:41:01,939 --> 00:41:05,523
You should've come to get me.
How long did Dr. Kovac work on him?

732
00:41:05,694 --> 00:41:07,272
He didn't. She signed a DNR.

733
00:41:07,447 --> 00:41:08,692
Where is he?

734
00:41:08,865 --> 00:41:10,110
- Who?
- Kovac.

735
00:41:10,284 --> 00:41:11,944
He's home. His shift ended at 10.

736
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:14,243
All right, I'm gonna move her
to a quiet room.

737
00:41:14,415 --> 00:41:17,535
Call the social worker and get her
referrals for grief counseling.

738
00:41:17,711 --> 00:41:19,669
Are you leaving soon?

739
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:22,591
I'm just finishing up with Woody here.

740
00:41:22,759 --> 00:41:25,216
You' re the most beautiful nurse
in this hospital.

741
00:41:25,388 --> 00:41:28,390
- Well, thank you.
- You've got class.

742
00:41:29,476 --> 00:41:31,470
- May I play with your breasts?
- Hey.

743
00:41:31,646 --> 00:41:33,521
- Excuse me?
- Please.

744
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:36,100
Last request
of a man on his deathbed.

745
00:41:36,277 --> 00:41:38,021
You' re not dying, Woody.
You' re drunk.

746
00:41:38,196 --> 00:41:41,152
I wanna go to heaven on the bosom
of a beautiful woman.

747
00:41:41,326 --> 00:41:43,996
I don't think your HMO covers that.

748
00:41:44,664 --> 00:41:46,123
How long you have that outfit?

749
00:41:46,291 --> 00:41:49,163
- Tomorrow at noon. Why?
- Maybe I could talk you into...

750
00:41:49,337 --> 00:41:52,173
- ... giving me a sponge bath.
- What's in it for me, bony boy?

751
00:41:52,341 --> 00:41:54,667
I'll give you a bone,
nasty, naughty little nurse.

752
00:41:55,678 --> 00:41:57,339
Elizabeth.

753
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:01,515
Robert, can we talk tomorrow?
I have to get Ella home.

754
00:42:01,687 --> 00:42:04,179
I thought you might want this
before you left.

755
00:42:06,777 --> 00:42:08,355
It's my ring.

756
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:12,114
Amazing what you can do
with a laparoscopic camera and a snare.

757
00:42:12,285 --> 00:42:13,993
Thank you.

758
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:20,915
- Look, about today...
- Let's not.

759
00:42:21,088 --> 00:42:25,254
It was a momentary weakness
on my part. It won't happen again.

760
00:42:27,305 --> 00:42:29,382
You'll work through this, Robert.

761
00:42:30,476 --> 00:42:32,055
Of course I will.

762
00:42:33,313 --> 00:42:35,806
- Good night.
- Night.

763
00:43:55,008 --> 00:43:57,678
The patient has gastroenteritis,
vomits to excess...

764
00:43:57,845 --> 00:44:02,342
...has hematemesis, no history of PUD.
What are you thinking?

765
00:44:02,935 --> 00:44:04,346
Well?

766
00:44:04,562 --> 00:44:06,971
Mallory-Weiss tear.

767
00:44:08,109 --> 00:44:11,942
Laceration of the distal esophagus
results in an upper GI bleed.

768
00:44:12,907 --> 00:44:15,529
You' re both correct and tardy.

769
00:44:15,744 --> 00:44:18,532
- Sorry.
- Don't be sorry. Be punctual.

770
00:44:18,707 --> 00:44:21,115
What if that patient vomits
and develops chest pain?

771
00:44:21,294 --> 00:44:22,543
Boerhaave's syndrome.

772
00:44:22,571 --> 00:44:25,874
Spontaneous rupture of the esophagus
associated with retching.

773
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:28,044
Usually tears into
the left pleural space...
