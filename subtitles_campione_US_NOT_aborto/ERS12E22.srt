1
00:00:11,982 --> 00:00:15,054
-So we can't even send anything, or. . .?
-Flowers? Donations?

2
00:00:15,222 --> 00:00:16,973
There's gonna be a memorial next week.

3
00:00:17,141 --> 00:00:20,371
For today, Neela and the Gallants wanna
have a private graveside ceremony.

4
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,656
-Family only.
-And you.

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,012
Yeah, that's right. She needs
somebody to lean on right now.

6
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,773
-Plus, Mike and l were tight.
-Let her know we're with her.

7
00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:31,897
And tell her to not even think about
coming back until she's ready.

8
00:00:32,059 --> 00:00:35,767
All right. l should get out of here. Car's
picking me up. l need to be there by 9.

9
00:00:35,938 --> 00:00:39,691
Dr. Weaver, that was Dr. Anspaugh's
office. He's waiting for you upstairs.

10
00:00:39,857 --> 00:00:40,846
-Dr. Weaver.
Yep.

11
00:00:41,017 --> 00:00:43,577
This is Mary Warner. She's an
EMT trainee from Mitchelson.

12
00:00:43,737 --> 00:00:47,729
Hi. My program sent me over to spend
the day taking vitals or whatever.

13
00:00:47,896 --> 00:00:49,295
-For credit.
-Of course.

14
00:00:49,456 --> 00:00:51,889
Somebody needs to sign this
at the end of the shift. . .

15
00:00:52,055 --> 00:00:54,011
. . .to say that l was here and did stuff.

16
00:00:54,175 --> 00:00:56,290
What would you like to do?
-Let her shadow.

17
00:00:56,454 --> 00:01:00,766
-See how different nurses do the primary.
-That's what my instructor suggested.

18
00:01:00,934 --> 00:01:05,006
Well, patients come in
through the triage desk here.

19
00:01:05,173 --> 00:01:09,529
Waiting's out there, and ambulance runs
come in just outside those doors there.

20
00:01:09,692 --> 00:01:12,764
-Right, l got it.
-How long you wanted to be an EMT?

21
00:01:12,931 --> 00:01:17,482
Oh, not long, actually.
l got tired of retail. Christmas sucked.

22
00:01:17,651 --> 00:01:20,960
Sam, this is Mary Warner,
she's studying to be an EMT.

23
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,644
Hey.
-l've got to irrigate a full-body road rash...

24
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,323
. . .on an unfortunate Vespa driver.

25
00:01:25,489 --> 00:01:27,127
l got the mother
of all meth mouths here.

26
00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:30,042
So? Can you let Mary
observe you for a while?

27
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:32,517
-Haleh.
-l'll come and get her as soon as l'm free.

28
00:01:32,688 --> 00:01:34,997
-Haleh.
-Bye.

29
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:39,005
-Yuck.
-Yep, that's the magic of meth.

30
00:01:39,447 --> 00:01:43,121
Corrosive substances in the drug
eat away at the tooth enamel.

31
00:01:43,286 --> 00:01:46,995
Plus, l have a feeling Mike here
hasn't been flossing. Have you, Mike?

32
00:01:47,486 --> 00:01:49,237
lt's not really a priority.

33
00:01:49,605 --> 00:01:51,402
Dude, you gotta floss every day.

34
00:01:56,364 --> 00:01:57,399
Hey.
-Hey.

35
00:01:57,564 --> 00:01:59,998
So how's she doing?

36
00:02:00,163 --> 00:02:03,280
-l left messages, but haven't heard back.
-Amazingly well, actually.

37
00:02:03,963 --> 00:02:05,954
Well, she's tougher
than she looks, huh?

38
00:02:06,562 --> 00:02:07,995
Yeah.

39
00:02:08,602 --> 00:02:10,513
l'll try calling her again.

40
00:02:10,682 --> 00:02:13,070
Ray, l think she needs
some space, man.

41
00:02:15,321 --> 00:02:17,391
-Yeah, but l just thought that--
-Look, she. . . .

42
00:02:17,881 --> 00:02:19,598
l just don't think
that you should, uh. . . .

43
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,959
What?

44
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,789
Complicate it.

45
00:02:29,798 --> 00:02:32,756
-You Dr. Pratt?
-Yeah, that's right. Where's Neela?

46
00:02:32,918 --> 00:02:35,796
Dr. Rasgotra has asked that we go on
to the cemetery without her.

47
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:38,027
She said she's not
feeling up to it today.

48
00:02:55,834 --> 00:02:57,233
Okay.

49
00:03:07,552 --> 00:03:11,022
Hey. Bob Vila, look out.

50
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:14,622
-lt's not finished yet.
-Looks pretty finished to me.

51
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,585
Well, either l've been sleeping for days,
or you're working really fast.

52
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:25,025
How's the insomnia?

53
00:03:25,189 --> 00:03:29,545
l kept thinking about
Gallant and Clemente.

54
00:03:31,388 --> 00:03:33,060
lt's a lot.

55
00:03:35,947 --> 00:03:38,177
l went with yellow.

56
00:03:38,347 --> 00:03:42,339
Because we don't know
is it gonna be blue or pink.

57
00:03:43,386 --> 00:03:46,059
What's it gonna be, huh?
Blue or pink? Hello.

58
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:48,580
ls it just me,
or are pandas kind of creepy?

59
00:03:48,745 --> 00:03:50,622
Wow, they're terrifying.

60
00:03:50,785 --> 00:03:52,217
Hey. Steady.

61
00:03:54,784 --> 00:03:56,103
Hello.

62
00:03:56,264 --> 00:03:59,858
Listen, l know we don't say it,
because l guess that's just how we are. . .

63
00:04:00,023 --> 00:04:04,573
. . .but l hope you know
how much l love this.

64
00:04:05,142 --> 00:04:06,495
All of this.

65
00:04:11,781 --> 00:04:16,296
But since we are on the cusp
of this hugely life-altering event. . .

66
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:21,453
. . .and we haven't been as specific
as we could be about us. . .

67
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:24,850
-. . .about our relationship--
-You're right, let's get married.

68
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:28,920
Donald, oh, l'm sorry l'm late.

69
00:05:29,088 --> 00:05:32,159
l didn't realize we were having
a pre-meeting. l went to your office--

70
00:05:32,327 --> 00:05:33,806
Have a seat.

71
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:37,846
l wanted us to talk prior to the session
with the Medical Executive Committee.

72
00:05:41,926 --> 00:05:44,075
The fallout from Clemente. . .

73
00:05:44,685 --> 00:05:46,516
. . .may be more significant
than l thought.

74
00:05:48,005 --> 00:05:50,393
-l've been hearing things.
-What kind of things?

75
00:05:51,764 --> 00:05:55,040
This is a letter from an attorney
representing Mr. Fred Fong. . .

76
00:05:55,204 --> 00:05:57,159
. . .a patient Clemente saw
a few weeks back.

77
00:05:57,323 --> 00:06:00,314
Yes, diabetic with a gangrenous toe.
l've reviewed the case.

78
00:06:00,482 --> 00:06:01,881
Ended up needing an amputation.

79
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:05,359
A reasonable outcome for which
Vic was completely blameless.

80
00:06:05,882 --> 00:06:07,917
The family sees an opportunity.

81
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,676
You know, can we talk in private?

82
00:06:11,161 --> 00:06:12,957
l'm sorry.

83
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,635
Hospital policy.
l need this conversation documented.

84
00:06:18,719 --> 00:06:21,472
Dr. Clemente was cleared
by the lmpaired Physicians' Committee.

85
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:23,436
He never once tested positive
for drugs.

86
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:25,589
l don't believe
he compromised patient care.

87
00:06:25,758 --> 00:06:27,510
l'm not sure that that matters.

88
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:32,626
The state board posts a bad-doctor list
on their website, and Clemente's on it.

89
00:06:32,797 --> 00:06:36,106
-Any idiot with a computer has access.
-Doesn't give them legal cause.

90
00:06:36,276 --> 00:06:39,825
Let's let the lawyers determine that. ln
the meantime, the board feels let down.

91
00:06:39,996 --> 00:06:43,385
They expect their chief of staff to
exercise the utmost discretion in hiring.

92
00:06:43,555 --> 00:06:47,513
l needed an Attending, Donald.
l hired the best doctor l could find.

93
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:50,142
Even when you knew his history?
What happened in Newark?

94
00:06:50,314 --> 00:06:54,226
l'm tired of hearing about Newark.
That was a very complicated situation.

95
00:06:54,393 --> 00:06:57,112
Very unclear. There were lots
of unsubstantiated allegations.

96
00:06:57,273 --> 00:07:00,787
-You should have kept your eye on him.
-You know, l'm not down there, Donald.

97
00:07:00,952 --> 00:07:02,544
l don't run the ER anymore.

98
00:07:02,712 --> 00:07:05,101
Which leads me to a second issue.

99
00:07:05,272 --> 00:07:08,627
The board has concerns about Dr. Kovac's
ability to manage the department.

100
00:07:09,871 --> 00:07:11,428
You're not serious.

101
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,979
Are you satisfied
with the job he's doing?

102
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:18,985
He's doing the best he can
with what he has.

103
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:22,622
Keep him on 100 percent.
Six of Pavulon.

104
00:07:22,788 --> 00:07:23,982
l gave him Norcuron.

105
00:07:25,108 --> 00:07:27,906
Fine. Dopamine to a systolic of 1 00.

106
00:07:28,587 --> 00:07:31,021
-Did you call the lCU?
-Ten minutes ago.

107
00:07:31,187 --> 00:07:35,577
Okay, fine. Let's find him
a monitored bed until we get a room.

108
00:07:35,986 --> 00:07:37,339
l'll put him in 2.

109
00:07:47,984 --> 00:07:49,178
Cold shoulder, huh?

110
00:07:49,864 --> 00:07:52,093
Well, not exactly the answer
l was hoping to hear.

111
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,857
Well, not exactly the best proposal
l've ever heard.

112
00:07:55,023 --> 00:07:56,251
How many have you heard?

113
00:07:57,223 --> 00:08:01,056
Hey, hey, hey. Okay, so you don't know
what you want this to be.

114
00:08:01,222 --> 00:08:04,418
l don't wanna get married for the sake
of getting married. l tried that.

115
00:08:04,581 --> 00:08:07,493
-Don't we love each other?
-lt's not about that. Of course we do.

116
00:08:07,661 --> 00:08:09,890
Don't you think
we should stay together forever?

117
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:14,850
-l don't know if anybody should, or can--
MORRlS: Paging Dr. Lockhart.

118
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:19,408
l just-- Let me get through one
humongous life change at a time, okay?

119
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:22,457
Luka, got a minute?

120
00:08:22,618 --> 00:08:24,017
Yeah.

121
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:27,810
Sometimes it's easier
if you lump them all together.

122
00:08:32,976 --> 00:08:34,329
-Hey.
-Hey.

123
00:08:34,496 --> 00:08:38,125
-How's the hip?
-Good, thanks. Better all the time.

124
00:08:38,296 --> 00:08:40,525
Looks like you'll be short
an Attending after all.

125
00:08:40,695 --> 00:08:44,085
l have to attend an emergency
Med Exec Committee meeting.

126
00:08:44,255 --> 00:08:48,611
Risk Management is coming to advise us
on the Clemente situation.

127
00:08:49,214 --> 00:08:50,647
What situation? He's gone.

128
00:08:50,974 --> 00:08:54,761
Well, there's potential litigation.
We're getting some heat about it.

129
00:08:55,373 --> 00:08:56,692
We are getting some heat?

130
00:08:57,053 --> 00:08:58,371
lt's your department.

131
00:08:59,052 --> 00:09:00,565
Kerry, he was your hire.

132
00:09:00,732 --> 00:09:02,801
He was on staff
before l moved up to this job.

133
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:05,087
Yeah, l know that,
l'm the one who moved you up.

134
00:09:05,251 --> 00:09:07,481
So, what, l should have
fired him sooner?

135
00:09:07,811 --> 00:09:11,405
The warning signs were there.
You had the authority.

136
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:15,999
Am l gonna lose my job over this?

137
00:09:16,169 --> 00:09:18,888
Look, all l'm saying is,
if l weren't chief of staff. . .

138
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:21,039
. . .l'm not so sure
you'd be department head.

139
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:24,245
So let's just get through this, okay?

140
00:09:26,447 --> 00:09:27,766
Neela.

141
00:09:31,846 --> 00:09:33,723
You know,
l'm not used to getting stood up.

142
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:35,480
l'm not going, Greg.

143
00:09:36,246 --> 00:09:37,598
lt's gonna be fine, l promise.

144
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:44,396
Well, going means saying goodbye,
and saying goodbye means forgetting.

145
00:09:45,364 --> 00:09:46,433
lt doesn't have to.

146
00:09:47,884 --> 00:09:49,521
l can't help it.

147
00:09:49,683 --> 00:09:55,154
lt's started already.
l can't remember his hands, his voice.

148
00:09:58,402 --> 00:10:00,119
Can l come in?

149
00:10:02,481 --> 00:10:05,871
l keep asking myself
why he went back.

150
00:10:06,841 --> 00:10:09,274
lt's like a hammer in my head.

151
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,708
He did what he wanted to do.

152
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:15,631
What he needed to do.

153
00:10:17,838 --> 00:10:20,398
lt's not a bad way to go.

154
00:10:20,558 --> 00:10:23,549
He was 29 years old, Greg.

155
00:10:23,717 --> 00:10:25,150
He was blown up by a bomb.

156
00:10:26,277 --> 00:10:29,394
lt's a tragedy, and believe me,
l'm not saying it isn't. . .

157
00:10:29,557 --> 00:10:33,674
. . .but Michael, he wanted to be a part
of something bigger than himself.

158
00:10:34,476 --> 00:10:37,547
Now, two months ago,
l would have laughed at that.

159
00:10:37,715 --> 00:10:39,467
But now. . . .

160
00:10:40,435 --> 00:10:44,109
Look, he put himself out there,
and sometimes that means taking risks. . .

161
00:10:44,274 --> 00:10:48,152
. . .and doing things that
you could never imagine yourself doing. . .

162
00:10:48,313 --> 00:10:50,702
. . .because you have
this crazy idea that. . .

163
00:10:50,873 --> 00:10:54,024
. . .you just might be able
to make a difference.

164
00:10:56,272 --> 00:11:00,105
Nobody wants to forget Michael.

165
00:11:00,271 --> 00:11:02,626
We all wanna remember him.

166
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:06,588
And that's exactly
what today is all about.

167
00:11:12,429 --> 00:11:16,467
Smart, uh, efficient, um. . . .

168
00:11:17,748 --> 00:11:20,501
-Loyal friend.
-Something sexier.

169
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:25,026
-Sexier?
-Something about my charm.

170
00:11:25,187 --> 00:11:28,656
Like a man
whose charm with women. . .

171
00:11:28,826 --> 00:11:31,784
. . .is matched only by his sensitivity
to his patients. Yes, action.

172
00:11:31,946 --> 00:11:33,174
This is stupid. Forget it.

173
00:11:33,346 --> 00:11:35,222
-What? Abs, this is it.
-Don't call me Abs.

174
00:11:35,385 --> 00:11:38,138
l am out of here. You're not
gonna have Archie to kick around.

175
00:11:38,305 --> 00:11:40,659
-Abs?
-Can't blame a guy for wanting memories.

176
00:11:40,824 --> 00:11:44,100
You're not going to Kilimanjaro.
You're going to Ladokern Pharmaceuticals.

177
00:11:44,264 --> 00:11:46,652
-Seven city blocks from here.
-Six and a half.

178
00:11:46,823 --> 00:11:49,781
Besides, people don't make memory
videos unless they're getting married.

179
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:52,740
-l'm a sentimental guy.
-And they don't film them themselves. . .

180
00:11:52,902 --> 00:11:54,972
. . .so the person is held hostage
to say nice things.

181
00:11:55,142 --> 00:11:58,975
Really? You didn't seem held hostage.
l expected better material out of you.

182
00:11:59,141 --> 00:12:01,291
Well, you were feeding me
the lines, Fassbinder.

183
00:12:01,461 --> 00:12:03,770
Oh, what was that?
Some kind of nasty Croatian word?

184
00:12:03,941 --> 00:12:07,091
-Something about me and a goat?
-This is Timmy Jankowski.

185
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,978
Overindulged at the buffet
at his school's spring pageant.

186
00:12:10,219 --> 00:12:11,618
Let me guess. Fruit salad.

187
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:13,538
You must be the funny guy.

188
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,371
School nurse brought him in.

189
00:12:16,538 --> 00:12:20,292
As this is my last day, and seeing that
l am chief resident, l designate Lockhart.

190
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,334
-Excuse me?
-l'm out of here in 1 0 hours.

191
00:12:22,497 --> 00:12:26,172
l call no kids for the duration. l'm sick
of getting bit, kicked and pissed on.

192
00:12:26,337 --> 00:12:27,928
Guess you stopped dating too, huh?

193
00:12:28,096 --> 00:12:31,930
We got a 71 -year-old male found
slumped over in a parked car. GCS, 224.

194
00:12:32,096 --> 00:12:36,646
Okay, put him in Curtain 1 . l'll try
to be right back. Take it easy, Timmy.

195
00:12:36,815 --> 00:12:41,171
Easy? l'm a freaking strawberry.

196
00:12:41,854 --> 00:12:44,322
-Stomach hurts pretty bad, huh?
-Kind of.

197
00:12:44,494 --> 00:12:47,166
Hm. Well. . . . Here.

198
00:12:48,573 --> 00:12:50,291
Try pinching yourself.

199
00:12:51,852 --> 00:12:54,650
-Here, let me do it.
-Ow! That hurts.

200
00:12:54,812 --> 00:12:57,484
Well, you're not thinking
about your stomach now, are you?

201
00:12:59,051 --> 00:13:01,884
When Mitch didn't show up
for the bus trip to Bloomington. . .

202
00:13:02,051 --> 00:13:03,449
. . .we knew something was wrong.

203
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:07,683
-They're part of the same church group.
-Mitch. Mitch, can you wake up for me?

204
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:12,998
We prayed and prayed,
and then we started seeing things.

205
00:13:13,169 --> 00:13:15,636
Everybody thought he was dead.
-But we found him.

206
00:13:15,808 --> 00:13:20,244
-Our visions led us right to him.
-A half a mile from the church.

207
00:13:20,407 --> 00:13:22,557
-Can you save him?
-We're gonna do our best.

208
00:13:22,727 --> 00:13:24,638
Oh, thank you.

209
00:13:24,807 --> 00:13:27,684
And, uh. . . .

210
00:13:30,366 --> 00:13:34,438
You should be very, very proud,
Mr. and Mrs. Morris.

211
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:38,756
Okay, cut. Mama Morris is dead,
so can we take that one more time?

212
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,757
-Holly says they need us in Exam 3.
-Holly?

213
00:13:42,324 --> 00:13:43,756
You know, that other nurse.

214
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:46,676
Haleh? l gotta go.

215
00:13:46,843 --> 00:13:48,959
The old lady in 3's
still waiting on her rectal.

216
00:13:49,123 --> 00:13:52,000
No, no, no. Not on my last day.
No rectals, no geezers.

217
00:13:52,162 --> 00:13:54,073
Any patients
you're willing to examine?

218
00:13:54,242 --> 00:13:55,833
MORRlS:
Yeah, hot chicks.

219
00:13:56,281 --> 00:13:58,795
l got the vitals like you asked,
on the medium timer.

220
00:13:58,961 --> 00:14:01,758
Mediastinum. Mediastinal mass.

221
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,430
Whatever. Had to pry her cell phone
off her ear to check her temp.

222
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,476
-Mary--
-She thinks l'm a bitch. . .

223
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:10,153
. . .but this is a hospital,
we've got a job to do.

224
00:14:10,319 --> 00:14:12,549
Did you write this? BP, 28/1 7?

225
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:16,553
-Did l do it wrong?
-28/1 7 is practically dead. . .

226
00:14:16,718 --> 00:14:19,277
. . .not eating Jell-O
or chatting on your cell phone.

227
00:14:19,437 --> 00:14:21,587
Sorry, l'm new to this.

228
00:14:22,437 --> 00:14:24,392
-ls that her?
Yeah.

229
00:14:24,556 --> 00:14:26,786
She look dead to you?
-Not right now.

230
00:14:26,956 --> 00:14:30,232
Before you take more, you need to know
what's normal and what's not.

231
00:14:30,396 --> 00:14:32,545
And if you're not sure,
then get some help, okay?

232
00:14:32,715 --> 00:14:36,503
-Okay.
-Let's see what we got in here.

233
00:14:37,394 --> 00:14:39,828
-Hey, what do you have?
-Obtunded with bradycardia.

234
00:14:39,994 --> 00:14:43,906
l need 0.5 of atropine, CBC, Chem-7,
ABG, tox screen. . .

235
00:14:44,073 --> 00:14:45,825
. . .and set up
for transcutaneous pacing.

236
00:14:46,193 --> 00:14:48,342
Okay, got it.
-No gag, l have to tube him.

237
00:14:49,032 --> 00:14:51,102
-What happened?
-Eight-oh and a Mac 2.

238
00:14:51,272 --> 00:14:53,149
He must have passed out
at the wheel.

239
00:14:53,312 --> 00:14:55,905
Not from drinking.
He's not like that.

240
00:14:56,191 --> 00:14:57,544
Atropine's in.

241
00:14:57,711 --> 00:14:59,268
Have another dose ready.
l need suction.

242
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,466
-ls he taking any medications?
BEATRlCE: Maybe.

243
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:04,060
-Maybe something for his pressure.
-Yes.

244
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,629
BEATRlCE: Right? Pressure.
Yeah.

245
00:15:05,789 --> 00:15:07,108
l'm in.

246
00:15:07,749 --> 00:15:09,102
Heart rate's down to 38.

247
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:11,259
Damn it, his lV blew.
We lost the pulse.

248
00:15:11,428 --> 00:15:13,305
Start compressions,
he needs to be paced.

249
00:15:13,468 --> 00:15:15,106
You know CPR, right?

250
00:15:15,268 --> 00:15:17,337
-Uh, yeah, a little.
Good, go.

251
00:15:18,947 --> 00:15:21,700
So how did you audition for this role?

252
00:15:21,867 --> 00:15:25,415
l didn't.
l wanted to be the bad bunny.

253
00:15:25,586 --> 00:15:29,021
l wanted to be the Cowardly Lion once,
but l had to play a Munchkin.

254
00:15:29,185 --> 00:15:30,982
They cast you as a Munchkin?

255
00:15:31,145 --> 00:15:32,703
lt was before my growth spurt.

256
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:36,136
Okay, no tenderness,
guarding or rebound.

257
00:15:36,304 --> 00:15:38,772
Think you could eat a Popsicle,
help settle things down?

258
00:15:38,944 --> 00:15:41,821
-Sure.
-l'll get it. Let me guess. Strawberry?

259
00:15:42,383 --> 00:15:45,216
Ah, and here comes our trusty
paramedic, Brian Dumar. . .

260
00:15:45,383 --> 00:15:47,338
. . .wheeling in another needy patient.

261
00:15:47,502 --> 00:15:50,574
Twenty-eight-year-old, blunt head
trauma, altered LOC, vitals stable.

262
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:52,971
Bitch-sucker.
Rabid dog, l'll send you to hell!

263
00:15:53,141 --> 00:15:55,132
Nasty fight in detention.
Partner's behind me.

264
00:15:55,301 --> 00:15:57,735
-Okay, Trauma 2. Ray will be right there.
-What?

265
00:15:57,901 --> 00:16:01,495
-No prisoners, man. l called it, last day.
-l'll send you all to hell!

266
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,969
-You kiss your cellmate with that mouth?
-l'm right here, you dumb bastard!

267
00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:08,848
--that opened up a recent surgical scar.
BP, 1 24/78, pulse, 98.

268
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:10,929
MORRlS: Your belly hurt?
-Hey, put me with him.

269
00:16:11,098 --> 00:16:13,328
-Nice to see you.
-Recovering from an appendectomy.

270
00:16:13,498 --> 00:16:16,250
-Must have ripped open his stitches.
MORRlS: Okay-- Oh, yuck.

271
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:17,486
Yeah, that's not good.

272
00:16:17,657 --> 00:16:20,490
Dr. Ray Barnett will be right with you.

273
00:16:22,016 --> 00:16:25,088
-How long do l have to keep this up?
-Epi infusion, 1 0 mics per minute.

274
00:16:25,256 --> 00:16:26,609
He's very healthy, Mitch is.

275
00:16:26,776 --> 00:16:28,128
-l ain't going anywhere!
BEATRlCE: Even virile.

276
00:16:28,295 --> 00:16:30,604
-Okay, tell me.
Bradycardic arrest.

277
00:16:30,775 --> 00:16:32,493
No response to atro,
no capture with pacing.

278
00:16:32,654 --> 00:16:34,133
l'm behind you, you bastard!

279
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:36,171
-What are you doing?
-CPR.

280
00:16:36,334 --> 00:16:39,086
You can't possibly hope
to perfuse the brain that way.

281
00:16:39,253 --> 00:16:41,528
Fuse the what?
-Okay, step back.

282
00:16:41,693 --> 00:16:43,445
Step back.

283
00:16:43,613 --> 00:16:45,364
-Who is she?
-Who are you?

284
00:16:45,532 --> 00:16:48,968
That's Mary. She's an EMT trainee.
She's shadowing the nurses today.

285
00:16:49,132 --> 00:16:52,646
Then you should be showing her
the right way to do things.

286
00:16:53,171 --> 00:16:54,923
Okay, Mary, l'm Dr. Kovac.

287
00:16:55,091 --> 00:16:58,287
l'm the Attending physician and the
ER chief, so let me train you a bit.

288
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,328
Hundred times a minute, and you
should really compress the chest.

289
00:17:12,968 --> 00:17:15,322
There'll be a military honor
as requested.

290
00:17:15,967 --> 00:17:17,798
l didn't request that.

291
00:17:18,127 --> 00:17:20,959
Colonel and Mrs. Gallant
requested it, ma'am.

292
00:17:22,206 --> 00:17:24,481
Sounds like something
he might want.

293
00:17:25,286 --> 00:17:29,073
After the ceremony, we'll head out
to the reception in Lincoln Park.

294
00:17:30,485 --> 00:17:32,952
Canap�s will be served.

295
00:17:38,203 --> 00:17:41,639
-Bed will be ready in half an hour.
-Sedation's off. He's trying to extubate.

296
00:17:41,803 --> 00:17:44,475
Give him a few minutes,
then you can pull it and send him up.

297
00:17:44,642 --> 00:17:46,439
-Hey, Luka, can l get a minute?
-Sure.

298
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:50,274
His heart's beating well now.
lt looks good.

299
00:17:50,441 --> 00:17:53,160
You hear, Mitch? You're okay.

300
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:57,794
-Probably took too many pills by accident.
-Oh, he gets confused sometimes.

301
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,996
Can we go now? Take him home?

302
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,389
No, probably not for a couple of days.

303
00:18:04,999 --> 00:18:08,673
-Something the matter?
-There's something bad here, l can feel it.

304
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:11,830
Yeah. Heh-heh. l feel that every day.

305
00:18:12,237 --> 00:18:14,273
ls everything all right
with your baby?

306
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:19,714
lt's fine.

307
00:18:19,876 --> 00:18:22,231
Are you a believer, dear?

308
00:18:23,996 --> 00:18:25,826
BEATRlCE:
You must be very brave, then.

309
00:18:26,675 --> 00:18:29,587
l could never have brought a child
into this world. . .

310
00:18:29,755 --> 00:18:31,312
. . .if l didn't have faith. . .

311
00:18:31,474 --> 00:18:34,910
ln a higher power.
-...in a higher power.

312
00:18:35,074 --> 00:18:36,826
Amen.

313
00:18:38,113 --> 00:18:39,341
l'm sorry about in there.

314
00:18:39,513 --> 00:18:42,743
You're a senior nurse, l expect you
to know what's going on around you.

315
00:18:42,912 --> 00:18:45,187
l want you to be exact about meds.

316
00:18:45,352 --> 00:18:48,821
l know, it's-- l guess that that girl
is kind of dragging me down.

317
00:18:48,991 --> 00:18:51,869
l'm sure you'll whip her into shape.

318
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:56,344
My bad, l guess.
He sure is a gloomy Gus.

319
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,341
Needs to lighten up a bit, doesn't he?

320
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,864
lt's his department.

321
00:19:03,429 --> 00:19:05,896
Hey, Sam, you got a minute?
l may have to tube this guy.

322
00:19:06,068 --> 00:19:09,140
-l need you to draw up induction meds.
-Steve's here?

323
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:12,705
Yeah, he got in a little jail-yard
altercation, but he's okay.

324
00:19:12,867 --> 00:19:15,017
Belly's benign.
Looks like superficial dehiscence.

325
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:16,176
Does he need anything?

326
00:19:16,867 --> 00:19:20,256
Look, l'll get somebody else
to redress the wounds, okay?

327
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:22,417
l'll get you a CPR dummy, okay?
After this.

328
00:19:22,586 --> 00:19:24,416
You can practice compressions
in the lounge.

329
00:19:24,585 --> 00:19:27,338
l think l've had enough CPR for one day.

330
00:19:27,505 --> 00:19:30,257
GCS is 1 1 , and resps are shallow.

331
00:19:30,424 --> 00:19:33,063
Sometimes, if you hit your head,
you can stop breathing.

332
00:19:33,224 --> 00:19:34,895
-So then you do mouth-to-mouth?
-No.

333
00:19:35,063 --> 00:19:37,293
We put a tube in his trachea
and breathe for him.

334
00:19:37,463 --> 00:19:40,535
This is vec. lt knocks him out
so we can do the intubation.

335
00:19:43,462 --> 00:19:47,249
-1 32/84.
-Good.

336
00:19:47,661 --> 00:19:49,219
Pulse ox is up to 99.

337
00:19:49,381 --> 00:19:52,178
Excellent. Let's lay off the tube for now,
he's doing okay.

338
00:19:52,341 --> 00:19:54,900
Doc, how long l gotta wait
on Miss Congeniality here?

339
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,620
He needs to be admitted for observation.

340
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:58,768
Jerk-off.

341
00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:02,009
Come on, Hendricks,
we're missing lunch.

342
00:20:02,179 --> 00:20:04,009
-Gumbo Thursday.
-Hey.

343
00:20:04,178 --> 00:20:06,692
As long as they're here,
they're patients, not prisoners.

344
00:20:06,858 --> 00:20:09,735
Sorry, but they're always our prisoners.

345
00:20:10,257 --> 00:20:12,134
Been a while since l seen that.

346
00:20:12,577 --> 00:20:16,012
-What?
-Compassion.

347
00:20:45,891 --> 00:20:47,210
OFFlCER:
Flank party.

348
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,850
Ready.

349
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,328
Ready, aim, fire.

350
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:55,726
Ready, aim, fire.

351
00:20:58,209 --> 00:21:00,598
Ready, aim, fire.

352
00:21:15,486 --> 00:21:18,284
Neela, it is too dangerous over there.

353
00:21:18,446 --> 00:21:21,755
lt's too dangerous for me, but it's okay
for you? What a load of crap.

354
00:21:21,925 --> 00:21:25,553
-Neela, l am a soldier, remember?
-You're also a husband, remember that?

355
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:39,916
Seems kind of silly now, but out
in the bay this morning, l was, uh. . . .

356
00:21:44,001 --> 00:21:46,310
l was thinking about asking you out.

357
00:21:49,081 --> 00:21:52,038
l was thinking of saying yes.

358
00:22:10,517 --> 00:22:13,110
OFFlCER:
Ready, face.

359
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:41,907
You better come back.
You know that, don't you?

360
00:22:44,871 --> 00:22:45,940
Yeah, l will.

361
00:22:47,591 --> 00:22:49,421
You ready?

362
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:52,466
Goodbye, Michael.

363
00:23:27,624 --> 00:23:29,216
-How am l doing?
-Your CT's normal.

364
00:23:29,384 --> 00:23:31,499
But it looks like
you'll be spending the night.

365
00:23:31,663 --> 00:23:32,937
Lucky me.

366
00:23:33,103 --> 00:23:35,491
Yeah, well, you've got
a standard-issue jump suit. . .

367
00:23:35,662 --> 00:23:38,051
. . .an armed guard,
and a major head injury.

368
00:23:38,222 --> 00:23:43,295
-You're not the luckiest guy in the world?
-Yeah. Could be worse, could be dead.

369
00:23:43,461 --> 00:23:45,372
No arguing that. Dead would be bad.

370
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:47,337
Hey, it's the other guy
who started it.

371
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,694
-ls that so?
Yeah.

372
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:53,214
l've made mistakes,
but that guy's a wrong number.

373
00:23:53,659 --> 00:23:55,934
l'd stay away from him.

374
00:23:56,099 --> 00:23:59,534
Thanks for the advice. l'm gonna
go check on the guy in Sutures.

375
00:23:59,698 --> 00:24:03,611
-Does he get a bandage on that?
-Just a little Neosporin. Oh. . . .

376
00:24:03,778 --> 00:24:06,450
-And we're gonna need some urine.
-l'll check his vitals.

377
00:24:06,617 --> 00:24:08,733
You said every 30 minutes.
lt's been 35.

378
00:24:09,697 --> 00:24:12,927
-l'm not peeing in front of everyone.
-Use the screen.

379
00:24:16,335 --> 00:24:18,007
Hey.
What's going on?

380
00:24:18,175 --> 00:24:20,769
-l'm getting to be like a regular.
-Leave the nurse alone.

381
00:24:20,935 --> 00:24:23,164
lt's all right. We know each other.

382
00:24:24,294 --> 00:24:27,331
-What is that?
-lt's called a moist-to-dry dressing.

383
00:24:27,494 --> 00:24:30,291
We soak gauze in saline,
then pack it in the wound.

384
00:24:30,453 --> 00:24:32,444
Ooh. Ooh.

385
00:24:34,052 --> 00:24:37,727
How'd you do this?
-Jerk tried to shiv me.

386
00:24:37,892 --> 00:24:40,086
What, Bible group
got out of hand, huh?

387
00:24:40,251 --> 00:24:41,923
He was trying
to snag my smokes, man.

388
00:24:42,091 --> 00:24:44,127
These dudes will beef it up
over anything.

389
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:47,123
-Thought you were trying to turn around.
-l am, Sammy.

390
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:51,604
-l really am.
-Then you gotta stay out of trouble.

391
00:24:52,089 --> 00:24:54,159
Hey, BP's 1 25 over--

392
00:24:54,329 --> 00:24:55,648
Nice and easy, dumbass.

393
00:24:56,809 --> 00:24:58,082
Pull the blinds, now.

394
00:25:02,248 --> 00:25:05,205
-Are you out of your mind?
-Pull the blinds, bitch.

395
00:25:07,207 --> 00:25:10,482
" Handsome. Sensitive.

396
00:25:16,285 --> 00:25:18,196
Macho?"

397
00:25:18,365 --> 00:25:21,356
-What is this macho?
-Thank you, Sveta, that's good.

398
00:25:21,524 --> 00:25:24,755
-Dude, l slayed him.
-No, no, he's still moving. Look.

399
00:25:24,924 --> 00:25:26,357
TlMMY:
But l cut off his head.

400
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:29,196
Well, l got to the Oblivion Gate
long before you did anyway.

401
00:25:29,363 --> 00:25:31,923
-Don't cheat, Jerry.
-l'm gonna move your old guy.

402
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:33,595
-The cops are coming.
-What for?

403
00:25:33,762 --> 00:25:36,322
There was a missing-persons report.
l gotta follow it up.

404
00:25:36,482 --> 00:25:39,598
-Who did the workup on migraine guy?
-Sam and Mary.

405
00:25:39,761 --> 00:25:42,673
These vitals are completely wrong.
Where's Sam?

406
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:45,479
-ln with prisoner number one.
-What?

407
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,314
Yeah, Steve and another guy came in.
l guess they had some sort of jail fight.

408
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,993
-Steve is here again?
-Mm-hm.

409
00:25:55,199 --> 00:25:58,986
Here's how this is goes. You're gonna
walk us out like old Steve's going back.

410
00:25:59,158 --> 00:26:02,035
This is it, Steve. You cross this line,
there's no stepping back.

411
00:26:02,277 --> 00:26:04,427
They got me, Sam,
on all kinds of stuff.

412
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:07,154
You are such an idiot.

413
00:26:07,876 --> 00:26:10,674
-l ain't getting out any time soon.
-That is what you deserve!

414
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:12,906
Hey, hey, kids.
Can we move this thing along?

415
00:26:13,075 --> 00:26:16,431
lf there's anything we haven't anticipated,
this is the time to mention it.

416
00:26:29,593 --> 00:26:30,661
Hey, open up.

417
00:26:33,032 --> 00:26:35,670
Um, just a second.

418
00:26:40,751 --> 00:26:42,069
Come on.

419
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:48,108
-Hi.
-What's going on?

420
00:26:49,349 --> 00:26:50,668
-Sit down.
-Come here.

421
00:26:51,749 --> 00:26:54,183
Sit down, now. Babe, tape him up.

422
00:26:56,268 --> 00:26:57,542
No! No, don't shoot!

423
00:26:57,708 --> 00:26:59,141
Luka!

424
00:26:59,308 --> 00:27:01,025
Shut up, shut up.
Luka.

425
00:27:01,507 --> 00:27:03,418
Stop!

426
00:27:07,146 --> 00:27:09,706
-What was that?
-The crap you were gonna give Rafe.

427
00:27:09,866 --> 00:27:11,504
Vec? You gave him vec?

428
00:27:23,583 --> 00:27:25,574
Get me the ambu-mask.

429
00:27:26,703 --> 00:27:28,295
-This thing?
-Yes.

430
00:27:28,463 --> 00:27:30,054
That was vecuronium.

431
00:27:30,222 --> 00:27:32,372
You were gonna give it to Rafe.
To knock him out.

432
00:27:32,542 --> 00:27:35,613
-lt paralyzes muscles, he's not breathing.
-Let's go, Sam.

433
00:27:35,781 --> 00:27:38,500
-He'll be paralyzed for the next half hour.
-Good.

434
00:27:38,661 --> 00:27:40,378
His diaphragm isn't working, okay?

435
00:27:40,541 --> 00:27:43,134
-He's gonna asphyxiate.
-Not our problem.

436
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,458
Look, if you leave him here,
in five minutes, he'll be dead.

437
00:27:46,619 --> 00:27:48,132
He needs to be intubated, please.

438
00:27:49,899 --> 00:27:52,493
You want a murder rap?
We're not killers, man.

439
00:27:52,659 --> 00:27:55,331
Let me fix him up.
l swear, l promise you. . .

440
00:27:55,498 --> 00:27:58,729
. . .if you let me fix him up,
l will walk you right out of here.

441
00:27:59,857 --> 00:28:01,813
Mary, go get the van.

442
00:28:01,977 --> 00:28:04,093
Curtis--
-Shut up, it's my call.

443
00:28:04,257 --> 00:28:07,089
-We'll be right out.
-Hey.

444
00:28:15,535 --> 00:28:17,206
Hi. ls the SonoSite in there?

445
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:21,128
-The ultrasound machine?
-Oh, l don't think so.

446
00:28:23,093 --> 00:28:26,722
-ls something going on?
-They're about to do an intubation.

447
00:28:26,893 --> 00:28:28,212
Who is? Kovac?

448
00:28:28,532 --> 00:28:31,569
No. No, he went over to that place
where they do the head thingy.

449
00:28:31,732 --> 00:28:34,564
-The head thingy? CT?
-The what?

450
00:28:34,731 --> 00:28:37,450
-CT?
CT, yeah.

451
00:28:37,611 --> 00:28:40,727
Oh, Exam 3.
That's where l saw it. Thanks.

452
00:28:45,329 --> 00:28:47,479
Sitting Bull...

453
00:28:47,889 --> 00:28:50,528
. . .was facing terrible odds
against Custer.

454
00:28:51,289 --> 00:28:55,520
He turned to his warriors and said,
"This is a good day to die. "

455
00:28:57,008 --> 00:28:59,567
That's how a soldier has to think.

456
00:28:59,767 --> 00:29:02,361
That's the kind of boy l raised.

457
00:29:09,885 --> 00:29:12,194
Michael would want you
to have these.

458
00:29:13,005 --> 00:29:15,518
To me, all they mean is that he's dead.

459
00:29:16,044 --> 00:29:19,195
-This is a hard time for all of us.
-How dare you.

460
00:29:19,884 --> 00:29:23,239
How dare you stand there
and say that.

461
00:29:24,523 --> 00:29:26,718
" A good day to die" ?

462
00:29:26,883 --> 00:29:29,157
l was explaining
the mindset of a warrior.

463
00:29:29,322 --> 00:29:30,994
You could have kept him here.

464
00:29:31,162 --> 00:29:33,072
-You could have saved him.
-Neela, sit down.

465
00:29:33,241 --> 00:29:36,631
But instead,
you made him want to go back.

466
00:29:36,801 --> 00:29:38,519
For what?

467
00:29:38,681 --> 00:29:40,910
Because there was something
noble in it?

468
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,830
Why did you do that?

469
00:29:44,999 --> 00:29:48,196
When it would have been
just as easy to convince him to stay. . .

470
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:50,872
. . .for a much better reason:

471
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:52,551
Because we loved him.

472
00:29:55,478 --> 00:29:57,513
Because we loved him.

473
00:29:59,637 --> 00:30:02,594
Neela, come on.
Let's go for a walk, okay?

474
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,874
l can't see anything.

475
00:30:12,195 --> 00:30:15,470
-Stick the damn thing in and let's go.
-lt doesn't work like that.

476
00:30:18,034 --> 00:30:21,662
-Luka, l'm sorry. l'm so sorry.
-He can hear you?

477
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:23,903
He's paralyzed,
but he can hear and feel.

478
00:30:24,073 --> 00:30:25,869
Come on,
she's waiting for us out there.

479
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:27,545
Come on, Sammy, we gotta go.

480
00:30:27,912 --> 00:30:29,823
Steve, why did you do this to me?

481
00:30:30,392 --> 00:30:32,859
lt was his idea, l swear.

482
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:35,147
Are we going together
or am l leaving you here?

483
00:30:35,311 --> 00:30:37,460
One more try, okay?

484
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:48,186
-Enough. Grab her and let's go.
-Yeah.

485
00:30:48,348 --> 00:30:49,576
-Put your hand--
-What?

486
00:30:49,748 --> 00:30:52,626
Put your hand right here
on his Adam's apple. Yes, push on that.

487
00:30:53,468 --> 00:30:54,616
Through the cords.

488
00:30:59,187 --> 00:31:01,825
Okay. Okay.

489
00:31:01,986 --> 00:31:04,454
Squeeze this bag.
Squeeze it just like that, okay?

490
00:31:04,626 --> 00:31:07,583
-l swear to God, right now. Right now!
-No.

491
00:31:07,745 --> 00:31:09,098
Come on.

492
00:31:13,864 --> 00:31:17,937
Thank God. Thank God.
l'm so sorry-- Ow!

493
00:31:18,104 --> 00:31:21,175
-He still needs help breathing.
Too bad for him.

494
00:31:58,057 --> 00:32:00,809
-Hey, Sam.
-Hey, Morris, l'll help you in a second.

495
00:32:00,976 --> 00:32:02,489
-Let me get Steve off.
-Hold it.

496
00:32:02,936 --> 00:32:05,244
You have a missing person.
An old guy?

497
00:32:05,415 --> 00:32:07,053
Mitch Keely?
We need to talk to him.

498
00:32:07,215 --> 00:32:08,853
He was moved.
Do you know where he is?

499
00:32:09,535 --> 00:32:12,287
No, l'm not sure.
You might wanna check in Sutures.

500
00:32:13,294 --> 00:32:15,649
Sutures?
Didn't you just come from there?

501
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:18,801
Oh. . . . Yeah.

502
00:32:21,133 --> 00:32:23,521
You know what?
Ask at the front desk, they'll help you.

503
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:27,367
Thanks.
-So back to the joint, huh?

504
00:32:27,532 --> 00:32:31,001
-Yeah, l'm a quick healer.
-Where's your fight-club buddy?

505
00:32:31,371 --> 00:32:33,326
They took him up to the ward
for observation.

506
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:36,319
Okay.

507
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:40,806
Well, nice to see you again.

508
00:32:41,449 --> 00:32:43,201
Watch your back.

509
00:32:44,649 --> 00:32:45,842
Let's go another way.

510
00:32:46,128 --> 00:32:47,846
This way's fastest.
That's what you said.

511
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:49,407
But there's cops now.

512
00:32:49,568 --> 00:32:52,365
Well, if we'd split right away,
we'd be on the Dan Ryan by now.

513
00:32:52,527 --> 00:32:54,245
Hey, Steve,
we could just turn around.

514
00:32:54,407 --> 00:32:57,796
We're only 30 seconds from freedom.
We are not pussing out now.

515
00:32:57,966 --> 00:33:01,356
And no more smoke signals
from you. Got it?

516
00:33:03,845 --> 00:33:05,756
Hey, Sam,
you gotta fill out the discharge.

517
00:33:05,925 --> 00:33:08,962
Admin says we gotta be really tight
about prisoner paperwork.

518
00:33:09,124 --> 00:33:12,002
Check in Sutures.
l think l might have left it in there.

519
00:33:14,724 --> 00:33:15,792
Okay, Abigail?

520
00:33:20,803 --> 00:33:22,121
Something's wrong.

521
00:33:26,601 --> 00:33:28,876
-Something's wrong.
-Hey, sheriff, hold up.

522
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:30,872
Hey. Hey, bring it back here a minute.

523
00:34:24,032 --> 00:34:25,021
Come on!

524
00:34:25,512 --> 00:34:26,546
Get in!

525
00:34:27,431 --> 00:34:29,387
-What the hell happened?
-Get in!

526
00:34:29,551 --> 00:34:33,941
Steve, just go! Stop! Just go!
Think about Alex. Steve, stop.

527
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:36,339
l already did.

528
00:34:39,509 --> 00:34:41,704
Alex!
-Get back!

529
00:34:43,268 --> 00:34:44,701
Go!

530
00:34:53,307 --> 00:34:54,296
Damn it.

531
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:05,258
lf you're good to walk,
move out into the bay. The ER is closed.

532
00:35:08,824 --> 00:35:12,418
Emergency, emergency.
We got shots fired by and at police.

533
00:35:12,583 --> 00:35:14,858
l got officers down at County General.

534
00:35:15,023 --> 00:35:18,173
lf you got someone hurt by you
or if you're hurt, give us a sign.

535
00:35:18,342 --> 00:35:20,458
-We can move people.
-Vehicle heading north. . .

536
00:35:20,622 --> 00:35:22,340
. . .from the hospital on Franklin.

537
00:35:22,502 --> 00:35:23,900
-You okay, honey?
-l think so.

538
00:35:24,061 --> 00:35:27,895
-ls this okay?
-Please. Need a doc here.

539
00:35:28,781 --> 00:35:31,294
Hey, buddy.

540
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:35,137
-Do you know what day it is? Neck.
-Axilla too.

541
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,290
Can we get a gurney in here, please?

542
00:35:37,459 --> 00:35:38,812
-Airway's okay.
-Pulse thready.

543
00:35:38,979 --> 00:35:40,934
Page Surgery.
You're gonna be fine, all right?

544
00:35:41,098 --> 00:35:43,976
Yeah, he's coming this way.
He's pretty bad. We'll take care of it.

545
00:35:44,138 --> 00:35:46,129
Hey, find Kovac. Jerry's hurt.

546
00:35:47,017 --> 00:35:50,453
lt's hard to breathe.
TlMMY: He saved me.

547
00:35:50,817 --> 00:35:53,569
-l almost got shot.
Zadro, get a gurney.

548
00:35:54,416 --> 00:35:56,611
Wow. Getting shot sucks.

549
00:35:56,816 --> 00:35:58,727
-Here.
Ow!

550
00:35:58,896 --> 00:35:59,884
ls that better?

551
00:36:01,055 --> 00:36:03,046
-Thanks, kid.
-Right, set up for a chest tube.

552
00:36:03,215 --> 00:36:06,923
-O2, 1 00 percent nonrebreather.
-Radial pulse strong. You're good, Jerry.

553
00:36:07,094 --> 00:36:10,449
-Jerry, man, what'd you do?
-l'm a big target.

554
00:36:10,893 --> 00:36:15,045
Oh, tell Frank l can't cover for him
on Friday, okay?

555
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:31,041
-This is on you, man.
-Just shut up. Shut up.

556
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:32,325
-Keep driving.
-Where to?

557
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,889
Put some distance between us.

558
00:36:34,049 --> 00:36:36,165
-We'll figure it out later.
-We need to figure--

559
00:36:36,329 --> 00:36:37,523
Just shut the hell up.

560
00:36:37,889 --> 00:36:41,085
You probably killed someone
back there, Steve. One of my friends.

561
00:36:41,448 --> 00:36:43,723
l thought you said
you were turning yourself around.

562
00:36:43,888 --> 00:36:45,684
l've been praying, Sam.

563
00:36:45,847 --> 00:36:47,644
And asking God
to make me a better man.

564
00:36:48,087 --> 00:36:50,998
And it took a while,
but he finally started talking back.

565
00:36:51,926 --> 00:36:53,279
That's not God.

566
00:36:54,646 --> 00:36:56,318
He said losing you
was where l went wrong.

567
00:36:57,125 --> 00:37:00,800
Everything would be right in my garden
if l could only get my family back.

568
00:37:01,925 --> 00:37:04,484
Did he tell you to do it with guns?

569
00:37:07,404 --> 00:37:08,962
Curtis. Steve Curtis.

570
00:37:09,124 --> 00:37:10,556
He's down to 80 systolic.

571
00:37:10,723 --> 00:37:12,475
The other one, l don't know.
There's a chart.

572
00:37:12,843 --> 00:37:16,312
-Where's Sam? Have you talked to her?
-We haven't located your nurse yet.

573
00:37:16,482 --> 00:37:17,961
We're still looking.

574
00:37:19,802 --> 00:37:21,951
-l'll be right back.
-Lot of pressure here, pal.

575
00:37:22,161 --> 00:37:24,595
Ah! Oh, man, l'm not liking that.

576
00:37:24,881 --> 00:37:28,077
You had to go and get shot. l was
three hours away from a clean getaway.

577
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,515
l can't find it.
MORRlS: Keep looking.

578
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,999
They taking him up to Surgery?

579
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:34,832
He arrested after the thoracotomy.
They're not optimistic.

580
00:37:34,999 --> 00:37:38,355
-l can't do this.
-He's a big man. Go supraclavicular.

581
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:41,032
-Supraclavicular?
-Ray, sew this in for me.

582
00:37:41,198 --> 00:37:44,428
The junction of the subclavian and the lJ
is a bigger target.

583
00:37:47,317 --> 00:37:51,195
-Are you okay, Abby?
-Yeah, l'm just, um. . . .

584
00:37:51,356 --> 00:37:53,950
l'm all dizzy. l hit my head.
l'll prime the rapid infuser.

585
00:37:54,116 --> 00:37:57,710
Enter at the clavisternomastoid angle.
And, bingo, we're in.

586
00:37:58,275 --> 00:38:01,108
Ladokern Pharmaceuticals
is gonna be lucky to have you.

587
00:38:01,275 --> 00:38:05,711
Ray, did Luka take your cop
up to the O.R.?

588
00:38:05,874 --> 00:38:08,706
l haven't seen him.
l thought he was with you.

589
00:39:11,222 --> 00:39:14,294
ls this something l never get over?

590
00:39:14,462 --> 00:39:15,941
No.

591
00:39:16,102 --> 00:39:19,377
This is something you find a place to put
and let it make you stronger.

592
00:39:20,341 --> 00:39:23,299
Then you go on living your life,
because that's all you can do.

593
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,017
That's the way
he would have wanted it.

594
00:39:38,698 --> 00:39:40,927
l think there's something going on
at the hospital.

595
00:39:41,097 --> 00:39:42,849
Dropped his pressure.
-How you doing?

596
00:39:43,017 --> 00:39:45,406
Time for you to say something
intended to be funny.

597
00:39:45,777 --> 00:39:47,971
Got to be bleeding in the belly.
-Belly is clear.

598
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:51,094
-Well, we're missing something.
-Units three and four going up.

599
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:55,688
-He needs a second chest tube.
-First one's in a good position.

600
00:39:55,855 --> 00:39:58,369
-He had less than 500 cc's out.
MORRlS: There's more in there.

601
00:39:58,535 --> 00:40:00,923
-l don't see a hemothorax.
-They wouldn't let us down.

602
00:40:01,094 --> 00:40:02,891
-What the hell happened?
-The O.K. Corral.

603
00:40:03,054 --> 00:40:04,772
Oh, my God. Jerry.

604
00:40:05,053 --> 00:40:07,283
-Any free fluid?
He may need a CT.

605
00:40:07,453 --> 00:40:08,852
-lt's not the belly.
Morris.

606
00:40:09,013 --> 00:40:10,411
Dr. Weaver, look at the film.

607
00:40:10,572 --> 00:40:13,006
The right hemithorax is slightly opaque.
That's blood.

608
00:40:13,172 --> 00:40:15,208
Don't see an air-fluid level
because he's flat.

609
00:40:15,372 --> 00:40:18,090
-The first tube should've drained it.
-Not if it's kinked or clotted.

610
00:40:18,251 --> 00:40:20,481
Oh. Oh. . . .

611
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:24,286
-Okay. Over a liter in the chest.
Where's another Thora-Seal?

612
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:27,123
-Next door, l think.
All right. Be right back.
