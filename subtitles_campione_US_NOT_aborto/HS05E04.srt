1
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,710
do you see them anywhere?

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,680
Why don't we go back to their
house, wait for them there.

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:13,680
Yeah, 'cause they'll probably answer
the door the sixteenth time I knock.

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,850
There they are.

5
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,140
I'm sorry I followed you here.

6
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,790
I just really wish you could give
me a few minutes of your time.

7
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,780
I know you would never agree
to make it an open adoption,

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,000
but I just figured maybe
you never had a choice.

9
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,680
I mean, it's china, right?

10
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,610
W-what did he say?

11
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:52,190
He wants you to leave them alone.

12
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,220
Please... I just want ten minutes.

13
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,710
Learn what you're
like,tell you about my life.

14
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:16,180
He said they have no daughter.

15
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,790
I am sorry you wasted a trip.

16
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,340
I know that's them.

17
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,640
How does that work?

18
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,110
How do I pray?

19
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,300
You make a wish and lift the buddha.

20
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:44,750
I wish they could
understand how badly I need this.

21
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,440
Now make the wish again.

22
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:01,470
If you cannot lift the buddha this
time, your wish will be granted.

23
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,540
Are you okay?

27
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,460
I picked cameron's pocket down in E.R.

28
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,790
I came up with a doozy.

29
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,440
Your mother called-- twice.

30
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,250
She's still healthy.

31
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,150
This 25-year-old woman,
on the other hand...

32
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,050
her messages sounded kind of urgent.

33
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,320
Well, that's the way women sound
when their spouse of 50 years dies.

34
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,770
Your dad died? Are you--

35
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,290
yep. Fine!

36
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:24,430
our patient, who's been known to
take a few drinks on non-occasions,

37
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,640
vomits blood and collapses
on a trip to china.

38
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,090
Chinese surgeons cut
out a foot of bowel,

39
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,220
but the pain is worse
now than it was before.

40
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,900
House, call your mom.

41
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,980
What are you, my mom?

42
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,490
We can continue this
differential in five minutes.

43
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,590
Are those bags under your eyes?

44
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,370
You were up all night.

45
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,670
You told her, didn't you?

46
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:48,320
I don't know what your daddy issues
are, but don't deflect them on me.

47
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,280
Told his wife he's been
getting some strange.

48
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:53,200
She kicked his adulterous
tuchus to the curb.

49
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,080
Seriously, you told her?

50
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,460
Yes, I told her.

51
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,400
But no, she did not kick me to the curb.

52
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,430
We stayed up late talking.

53
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,760
We're going to continue talking.

54
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,600
Much like House should be
doing with his mother right now.

55
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,600
anybody read chinese?

56
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,940
Otherwise, we have no idea
what these doctors did to her.

57
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,630
Kutner, you're sort of asian,
right? Get it translated.

58
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,970
What about meckel's diverticulum?

59
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:16,890
If the surgeons didn't remove the
diverticulum, it can cause pain, bleeding.

60
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,680
Too high up for a colonoscopy.

61
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:19,880
Ct could miss it.

62
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,400
Ultrasound's fastest.

63
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,210
And since I'm fastest
with the ultrasound...

64
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,750
House, let me do the ultrasound.

65
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,270
You need to deal with
your dad and stop--

66
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,410
I'm not deflecting because
I'm avoiding something deep.

67
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:33,370
I'm deflecting because I'm
avoiding something shallow.

68
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,310
Seriously, I'm fine.

69
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,450
I didn't even like the man.

70
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,410
no meckel'S.

71
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,460
Were you there for the rice
or the reeducation camps?

72
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,900
I was there to track down
my biological parents.

73
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:51,390
Like a salmon returning to
the stream where it was born.

74
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,990
Did you become whole again,
or did you get eaten by bears?

75
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,800
They denied my existence.

76
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,830
Four parents, and not one of them
taught you to cover your mouth.

77
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,190
Oh, my god! It looks
like they cut you in half.

78
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,840
Doctor, we're her parents.

79
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,550
I'm just a technician.

80
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,580
Her doctors will be by
later. You can schmooze then.

81
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,590
Can you let them know that we, uh,

82
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:16,670
we went by her apartment and
collected all her medication.

83
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,900
I'm a technician and a doctor.

84
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,280
You went through my apartment?

85
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,750
We found alcohol.

86
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,910
We thought you'd quit.

87
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,980
- Did her drinking cause this?
- No.

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,820
Can you tell her it did?

89
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,700
Licorice root.

90
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,820
Uh, no, thanks. I'm good.

91
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,990
I threw it to you for a reason.

92
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,070
That's what the chinese
doctors gave her.

93
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,340
It contains glycyrrhizin.

94
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,190
They were treating her for sars?

95
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,560
Not very effectively.

96
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:00,400
But sars explains the cough, causes
hypoperfusion, which explains the ischemic bowel.

97
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,030
It's perfect.

98
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,860
Lung involvement isn't very severe.

99
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,820
Okay, well, so call it "ars."

100
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,670
Start her on ribavirin and interferon.

101
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,490
Sorry about your father.

102
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,340
I'm not.

103
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:23,000
Are we done emoting now?

104
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,520
If there's anything I
can do, just--

105
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,850
you know, you're right.I don't
think I can sleep alone tonight.

106
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,530
And you can tell me
that that is liquid vicodin.

107
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:35,940
We're giving I.G.Shots to everyone
who came in contact with your patient.

108
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:40,430
Shockingly, none of the nurses
volunteered to administer yours.

109
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,970
It goes better in a large muscle.

110
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,420
Drop your pants.

111
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:49,820
You know, I usually pay tens
of dollars to hear that.

112
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,920
The funeral's tomorrow.

113
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,070
My mom called you?

114
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,050
There is a 3:40 flight out of newark.

115
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:05,610
If you leave now, you can
be in lexington tonight.

116
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,850
Your mother wants
you to deliver a eulogy.

117
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:11,300
"Eulogy. "From the
greek for "good word."

118
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,390
Now, if she asked meto deliver
a bastardogy, I'd be happy to--

119
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,980
then be a grown-up.

120
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,500
Call your mother back and tell
her that you're sick with grief,

121
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,860
but you're too busy to be there.

122
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,550
She knows when I'm lying.

123
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,420
Then start writing.

124
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,260
they yanked my brother
and sister out of college.

125
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,670
Can you please tell them I'm not dying?

126
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,900
You have sars.

127
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,200
I'm wearing a mask.

128
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,470
It's a big deal.

129
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,960
Cut 'em some slack.

130
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,740
But I am gonna be okay, right?

131
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,900
That's what all this stuff is for.

132
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:52,040
We're gonna need the names and numbers of
everyoneyou came in contact with here and in china.

133
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,510
Flight numbers, dates...

134
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:55,530
that doctor that I coughed all over...

135
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,100
is he gonna be all right?

136
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,290
So far he's fine.

137
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,150
It's back.

138
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,790
This is where the pain all started.

139
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,050
She's tachycardic. Get
a crash cart in here!

140
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:24,030
What's going on? I need to know
what's going on. That's my daughter.

141
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,590
Her liver's failing. It's not sars.

142
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,180
I am not doing this because I care.

143
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:05,550
Cuddy drugged me. She...

144
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,580
my mom didn't call
Cuddy. She called you.

145
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,280
I knew you couldn't stay away.

146
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:17,570
I knew you loved me too much.

147
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,180
I'm doing this for your mom.

148
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:21,060
I'm not doing this at all.

149
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:24,710
If there were something to be done, I would
have done it in the year he spent dying.

150
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,520
You took my vicodin?

151
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,940
I'm in pain.

152
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,480
One?

153
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,180
So the vicodin is my leash.

154
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:49,170
One'll take the edge off, but it won't give
me enough relief for an escape back to plainsboro.

155
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:58,390
Where's my phone?

156
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,780
That's the team. It's their ring tone.

157
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:05,600
Forget it.

158
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,150
The patient's blood is on your hands.

159
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,130
House? You there?

160
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,020
I'm being held against
my will. Call the police!

161
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,770
Nicole had a clot in the hepatic vein.

162
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,500
Chase sucked it out,saved her liver.

163
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,610
No signs of a tumor or
venous malformations.

164
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,290
- Nothing that could
cause-- - she's an addict.

165
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,640
- Drugs and alcohol
wouldn't-- - she's a smoker.

166
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,470
Combine smoking with any one of a dozen genetic
disorders, and she's a clotting machine.

167
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,980
Multiple blood clots would tie together
bowel ischemia, lungs, and the liver.

168
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:38,860
we need to pinpoint which defect she has so
we can start her on the right anticoagulant.

169
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:43,500
Draw her blood--let's find out which
genetic gift her genetic parents gave her.

170
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,760
Thanks for calling.

171
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,740
My ring tone for you is
dancing queen, by abba.

172
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,230
Nicole?

173
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,490
I need to pee. Pull
over at the next stop.

174
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:12,570
I'll just pee on the floor.

175
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,520
You bought used floor mats?

176
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:19,830
That is brilliant.

177
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,390
There's a rest stop in five miles.

178
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,350
Cane.

179
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:41,360
The restroom's right there.
You can make it on your own.

180
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,530
I suppose I could talk about the summer
he decided he wasn't speaking to me.

181
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,240
Two months,not one word.

182
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:57,210
Anything he wanted to say,he typed
up and slipped under my bedroom door.

183
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,490
You don't want to say
anything,don't say anything, but go.

184
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,140
Tell your mom you're sad for her.

185
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:05,140
Just by being there,I'd be lying.

186
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:09,010
She wants to think,for a moment,
that she had a happy family.

187
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:11,860
So give her
a gift--lie!

188
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,310
Give me my cane...

189
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:16,950
I'll go to the damn funeral.

190
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:40,280
I said I'd go to the
funeral. I didn't say when.

191
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,890
We have these two
categories:Inside and outside.

192
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,190
Patients stay inside.

193
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:53,250
Then, when they're better,we
let them go outside.

194
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:56,500
Thanks. But they
don'tlet you smoke inside.

195
00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:00,690
So why don't you go back there
and give me five minutes outside?

196
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,480
Make a fist.

197
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:20,530
'Sit such a beautiful day, we thought
we'd do all our doctoring outside.

198
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:24,530
People stare at me any
time I'm out with my family.

199
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,120
It's like a puzzle.

200
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,270
"Which one of these
things doesn't belong?"

201
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,960
Belonging's overrated.

202
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,470
I was adopted by a white
family when I was nine.

203
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,100
I like being different.

204
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:39,280
The view's better from
the outside looking in.

205
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:46,560
Must be easier to be
different when you're a success.

206
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,060
Is that a problem?

207
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,630
This is why we prefer inside.

208
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,780
You actually keep a flashlight that
doesn't need batteries in the trunk?

209
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:12,920
Next to the jacket, emergency water,nail
clippers, tooth brush,space blanket--

210
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:15,790
when things go wrong,I like to be ready.

211
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:20,200
Will you... please hold
the flashlight for a minute?

212
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,660
You know, those aren't just my car keys.

213
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,780
My House keys are on there too.

214
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,640
Amber gave me that key chain.

215
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,220
No, she didn'T.

216
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:43,220
Not unless your pet
name for her was "volvo."

217
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,050
A man who would lie about a
gift from a dead girl friend.

218
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:59,810
Is probably responding to a
childish, pointless act of petulance.

219
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:03,280
The struggle to resist one's
captors is never pointless.

220
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,160
Viva la resistance!

221
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:09,270
Well, I hate to break it to you,
che, but simple delay won't work.

222
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,500
Your mother will hold the
funeral till we get there.

223
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:17,820
My father was a punctual
man, beholden to time.

224
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,650
Two minutes late for
dinner,you didn't eat.

225
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:24,380
My mother would never disrespect
him by starting the funeral late.

226
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,600
Yeah, yeah, you clearly
have no issues to work through.

227
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,830
Come on, forget the
keys. Call a locksmith.

228
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,030
We'll go inside and play "guess that smell"
with the truckers while we're waiting.

229
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,950
Join me on the dark side.

230
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,900
The dark side's done,House.

231
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,980
I'm delivering you to your
mother, and that's it.

232
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,580
I have moved on.

233
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:58,070
What do you think House would send, the "gentle
comfort" arrangement or the "warm thoughts" bouquet?

234
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:01,230
I mean, if he wasn't an ass.

235
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,550
Send one of those giant
cookies shaped like a coffin.

236
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,020
His mom would believe it was from him.

237
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,010
I didn't tell you so
you could send anything.

238
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:12,630
Just wanted you to know the extent to which
the man is disconnected from the human race.

239
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,070
Took a six-pack of
ffp to stop the oozing.

240
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:16,390
She's bleeding and clotting?

241
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,660
Plus schistocytes on her smear means
it's dic, which means she's got cancer.

242
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:21,030
She's young. It could be leukemia.

243
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,110
Normal wbc makes that less likely.

244
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,790
The belly pain points toward a G.I.Tumor.

245
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:25,900
House already didan ultrasound.

246
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,560
He wasn't looking for
a tumor. Go run a ct.

247
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,730
I don't buy it.

248
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,410
Ct can find small intestinal
cancers that an ultrasound--

249
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,890
I don't buy House.

250
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,160
When my father died,I wound up
killing a patient. And I hated the man.

251
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,900
Whatever House says or doesn't
say, I'm sure the guy's a mess.

252
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,290
So he was a bastard. He
was still your father.

253
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,770
You're biologically programmed to
have feelings for him.

254
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,390
No, I'm not.

255
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,600
Feelings aren't rational.

256
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:00,530
I know you have trouble with anything
that can't be quantified and counted.

257
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:03,700
He's not my biological father.

258
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,840
I figured it out when I was 12.

259
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:09,640
Of course.

260
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,030
You were a brilliant,socially
isolated 12-year-old,

261
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:15,740
and you create a parallel universe
in which your life doesn't suck.

262
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,830
I look at the facts.

263
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:23,850
First of all, he was deployed on training exercises
off okinawa during the time I had to be conceived.

264
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:27,560
And since you're 150 years
old, air travel was impossible.

265
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,770
His second toe is
longer than his big toe.

266
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,000
Mine isn't.

267
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:35,070
This is sad. You don't
believe your mother screwed around--

268
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:40,290
I have a distinctivered birthmark on my scalp
that matches a certain friend of the family.

269
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,670
If you believed this story, you wouldn't
be telling me about his birthmarks.

270
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:46,530
You'd be telling me about the
genetic testing you had done.

271
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,750
And sinceyou haven't mentioned
it, obviously, you didn't do it.

272
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,310
Because you don't want
to--House, what are you doing?

273
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,710
Get your--get off
the-- there's a cop!

274
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,980
Nicole, lie still. This'll
only take a few seconds.

275
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:10,230
one millimeter cut
through upper abdomen.

276
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,130
She was adopted when the parents
thought they couldn't have kids.

277
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,380
Then they had three more.

278
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:18,350
She took the message as "thanks for
playing, but we have our real children now."

279
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:22,040
And the real children probably think
they're accidents while she was hand-picked.

280
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,880
Everybody's got
problems with their parents.

281
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:26,000
She's an addict. Something went wrong.

282
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:29,970
And it has to be the
parents? Magnifying pancreas.

283
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,560
I'm not saying the parents screwed up.

284
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:32,720
You're saying you like her.

285
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,420
So you don't want her
faults to be her fault.

286
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,550
But they're someone's fault, and
the only other people you know are--

287
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,560
I think we may need to call House again.

288
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:49,440
you lost track of your speed?

289
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:51,950
I think that was hitler's excuse.

290
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:54,010
Lost track of the jews.

291
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,620
No one held him responsible.

292
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,810
I'm not playing House.

293
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,450
You were protecting me.

294
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,530
Anybody in their right mind
would have ratted me out.

295
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,720
I'm just trying to speed things along.

296
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,640
You are going to this funeral.

297
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,360
Make it fast.

298
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,580
I don't want to miss the
anal cavity search.

299
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,610
Looks like a mass in the pancreas.

300
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:23,080
Not to me. This is radio.
And I want a full play-by-play.

301
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:24,930
It's fluid-filled.

302
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,250
Would you get out of
the car, please, sir?

303
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,800
Officer, if you want to give me
a ticket, I totally understand.

304
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,310
Just get out of the car, sir.

305
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,310
Cyst?

306
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,480
large cyst. Something going on there?

307
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:36,250
Wilson's getting arrested. how large?

308
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,800
suv sized,or mid-range sedan?

309
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,490
Seriously? What'd you do?

310
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,830
I'm obviously joking.

311
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:47,130
If wilson was getting handcuffed on the hood of
his car, would I be carrying on a differential?

312
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:50,250
Diameter is at least eight centimeters.

313
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,880
Is it in the tailor in the head?

314
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,090
the head.

315
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,620
You too, sir. Out of the car.

316
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,830
We've got a construction site.

317
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:00,250
A steamroller
is plowing--

318
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:03,300
out now.

319
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:08,570
No cane.

320
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:24,240
james evan wilson, there's a
warrant for your arrest in louisiana.

321
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:36,480
what are the traits of a steamroller?
Powerful. Maybe pancreatic cancer.

322
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:41,480
Great idea,except the only symptom it
matches up with is being steamrollerish.

323
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,160
You don't think House is onto something?

324
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:45,080
I think he thought he had an idea.

325
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:49,300
I also think his metaphors are tough
enough to decipher after he's said them.

326
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,900
We need to be focusing on the medicine.

327
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,120
No answer.

328
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,710
There's not gonna bean
answer. They've been arrested.

329
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,830
He was joking.

330
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,890
He reacted to the size and location.

331
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,300
That's what we should be focusing on.

332
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:04,140
Not playing mad libs while our patient's exploding
noun destroys her life-sustaining noun.

333
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,770
I'll try to get wilsonon the line.

334
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:09,450
What if it's not how a steamroller
works, but what it does?

335
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,990
Clears things.

336
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,300
This is a waste of time.

337
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:25,190
I need that phone call.

338
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,580
I'm a doctor, and when someone
tries to call you three times,

339
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,560
it's code for "pick up the damn
phone before someone dies."

340
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,940
I'm sure there's other smart doctors.

341
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:37,470
You'd be surprised.

342
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,470
You told me you'd taken care of this.

343
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,970
I did.

344
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,130
First words you ever said to me.

345
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:45,160
I took care of it.

346
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,750
You must've screwed up somehow.

347
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,730
Sir?

348
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:53,770
Not to hurry you, but we
need to be at a funeral--

349
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:59,320
nobody is going anywhere or taking any
phone calls till I hear back from louisiana.

350
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:01,370
It's a really old warrant.

351
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,820
Isn't there a statute of
limitations on this kind of thing?

352
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:06,680
It's suspended when you flee the state.

353
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:10,090
I didn't flee the
state. I left the state.

354
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,060
Because I don't live in the state.

355
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:16,210
And the charges were just so minor...

356
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,280
"vandalism, destruction
of property, assault."

357
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:22,600
There is a simple explanation.

358
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,930
There was a medical
conventionin new orleans...

359
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,970
you don't need to explain to me.

360
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,130
I was fresh out of med school.

361
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,770
I didn't know anybody at the convention.

362
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,390
You heard the man,wilson.

363
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,000
You don't have to explain.

364
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:37,560
I am not gonna sit here wasting time just
so you can avoid your father's funeral!

365
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:42,080
He's my father.

366
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,980
I have the right to avoid his funeral.

367
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:46,730
Not if your mother's alive,you don't.

368
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:50,380
Okay... explain.

369
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,360
did House react to
the eight centimeters?

370
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:56,430
He whistled. It's huge.
Anyone would think so.

371
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,500
House doesn't whistle because
he's impressed.

372
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,440
It means he wasn't expecting it.

373
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,840
It means he changed
his mind at that point.

374
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:07,220
a single super-sized cyst ruled out a
diffuse process like scleroderma or lupus.

375
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,680
Rule out diffuse process, you're stuck with
single process affecting just the pancreas.

376
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,720
Gallstones or pancreatic divisum.

377
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,800
Whatever he asked next would
have narrowed that down.

378
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,030
He asked about location.

379
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:18,120
Heads it's gallstones,tails
it's divisum.

380
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,370
It's at the head. She's got gallstones.

381
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,050
The steamroller meanspotholes--

382
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,870
relax. We got it.

383
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,290
You figured out she's got gallstones?

384
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:32,880
I was at the hotel bar trying
to unwind, have a drink.

385
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:39,630
There was this guy who kept playing billy joel's
leave a tender moment alone on the jukebox.

386
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,530
Leave a tender moment is a good song.

387
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,570
It's a great song. He was out of line.

388
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,800
Not as good as scenes from
an italian restaurant or...

389
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:50,160
so I--I asked the
man to stop, politely.

390
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,190
Yeah, you yelled politely.

391
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:57,930
I was polite the first couple of times,
but courtesy made no impressionon this ass.

392
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:02,850
So I threw a bottle into the mirror,

393
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,770
which successfully conveyed my message.

394
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:09,000
And smashed a ten-foot antique mirror.

395
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:12,320
And set an example to two other
patrons who threw shot glasses.

396
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,700
I had nothing to do with that fight.

397
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,920
The assault charge was totally bogus.

398
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:19,390
And I paid for the mirror.

399
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:22,150
I think I have the picture.

400
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,490
I assume you're the guy who
was playing the song.

401
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,860
No, I was the guy who bailed him out.

402
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:30,620
That's how we met. I was in jail.

403
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:33,950
This guy wasa total stranger
to you, and you bailed him out?

404
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:35,900
It was a boring convention.

405
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,560
Had to have somebody to drink with.

406
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:40,230
and there's the foundation
of our entire friendship.

407
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,170
If you hadn't been bored one
weekend, it wouldn't even exist.

408
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,200
Hey, there were 3,000
people at that convention.

409
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:48,340
You were the one I thought wasn't
boring. That says something.

410
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:50,880
It also says something that you lied to
me about getting the charges dropped!

411
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,730
I got a lawyer. He cut a deal.

412
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,370
You didn't call the guy? You
have to show up at the arraignment.

413
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,430
Everybody knows that.

414
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,250
Everybody with your
misdemeanor experience.

415
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,170
You can go.

416
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,440
What?

417
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:05,220
He--he's a
fugitive from justice.

418
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:07,600
That whole story was
lies. He stabbed a man.

419
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:11,430
Louisiana doesn't want
to pay to get you back.

420
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,940
Forget louisiana.

421
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,680
He was driving recklessly through
your comatose village.

422
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:19,150
Do they put lead in the
jelly doughnuts here?

423
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:23,570
Stop acting like such an ingrate and
go pay your respects to your father.

424
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:28,220
The ct confirmed gallstones.

425
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,570
Normally not dangerous.

426
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:32,430
Almost everyone has
them. But sometimes...

427
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,600
- they kill you?
- Yup.

428
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,480
Unless I take 'em out.

429
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:38,910
We do it laproscopically.

430
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,910
how long has her urine been brown?

431
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,860
Kidney's were fine this afternoon.

432
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:50,160
They're not now.

433
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:53,430
It's not the gallstones.

434
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,560
well, of course it's not gallstones.

435
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,870
Who thought it was gallstones?

436
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,320
You said "steamroller."

437
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,080
I also said "construction site."

438
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:05,080
Gallstones could cause a pancreatic cyst.

439
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:06,560
Just turn around.

440
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:08,220
The thing is two hours over already,

441
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:12,380
and that's the third time we passed that
colonial with the cross burning out front.

442
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,620
I'm not lost.

443
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:16,380
I'm not talking about
what caused the cyst.

444
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:19,160
I'm talking about what the
cyst caused. Everything.

445
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:21,260
Cysts are symptoms,not diagnoses.

446
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:24,900
Unless it's a multiple cyst,
with connections to other organs--

447
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,130
like a steamroller.

448
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:28,210
That's a long road down to the kidneys.

449
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,460
How do we prove it?

450
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,850
Won't be visible in a scan.

451
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:33,690
Chase isn't gonna go groping around
when she's got kidney failure.

452
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,840
Bubbles.

453
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:36,370
Is that your new stripper name?

454
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:39,790
Yes. And also,we inject bubbles into
the cyst and follow where they drift.

455
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,870
If they end up in the other organs, we
know you're right, cut it out, she's fine.

456
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:45,340
Bubbles is right. Go echo.

457
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:50,170
I'm not lost.

458
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,320
Nicole, you gotta stay still.

459
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,770
I'm--I'm nervous.

460
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:12,830
You're not nervous.
It's the dts, isn't it?

461
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,680
I haven't had a drink since I got here.

462
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,460
Good heavens,we haven't
missed it after all.

463
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:25,400
It's like the end of a christmas carol.

464
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:39,080
I'm so glad you're here.

465
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:44,060
Oh, it's a load off of
my mind just to see you.

466
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,110
Thank you, james.

467
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,940
Mom, how could you delay the funeral?

468
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:52,230
Honey, your dad is dead.
He's not going to care.

469
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,270
Do you know what you're going to say?

470
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:58,420
I don't know. Just let the minister
or one of his buddies from the corps...

471
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,790
you're talking.

472
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,830
I don't care that you didn't like him.

473
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,150
He was your father,and he loved you.

474
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:08,040
The war is over, greg.

475
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:11,740
Please do this for me.

476
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:16,480
Stop looking so worried.

477
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:19,260
I know he's gonna make me proud.

478
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:22,780
I'm sure you know him better than I do.

479
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,800
Her liver's been compromised.

480
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:33,890
And the dts will cause her muscles to
continue to twitch, even under sedation.

481
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,890
We need to paralyze
her to do this procedure.

482
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:37,590
I wanted to stop.

483
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:42,330
A phenobarbital coma will not only allow
us to inject the cyst,it'll treat the dts.

484
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,840
When she wakes up,she
won't be in withdrawal.

485
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:47,690
We've seen her through withdrawal before.

486
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,830
We've seen her through everything.

487
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,040
We've been supportive,
we've been combative.

488
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,250
We've picked her up from
bars in the middle of the night.

489
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:58,090
We've let her spend the night in jail.

490
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:02,610
I used to say it'd be okay.

491
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:05,010
That I'd get it together.

492
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,970
I don't say that anymore.

493
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,020
Let's make you healthy.

494
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:14,030
Then we'll worry about making you sober.

495
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:17,610
The lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want...

496
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:20,480
I am not talking.

497
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:24,710
We were strangers who shared
some geography 30 years ago.

498
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:27,280
Right, he had no influence on you at all.

499
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:29,900
The father who was
compulsive about punctuality.

500
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,280
His issue.

501
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,510
Which I deliberately made not my issue.

502
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:35,290
Thereby making it your issue.

503
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:40,280
Compulsively showing up four hours late,
ignoring discipline,ignoring rules.

504
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:42,050
Oh, god, he's here.

505
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,930
Who's here?

506
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,910
The one you're pretending is your father?

507
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,690
Nice pick. He looks like sean connery.

508
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:55,280
So back when you were devising this
fantasy, did you tell your father:

509
00:29:55,320 --> 00:30:01,310
"Dad, I refuse to recognize your existence
because I have chosen james bond as my dad"?

510
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:05,070
I used different words.

511
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,330
What?

512
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:12,660
Hearing your own son hates you so
much he's replaced you in his mind?

513
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,930
That's gotta suck. How did he take it?

514
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:20,030
I already told you. He didn't
speak to me for a summer.

515
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:33,830
It means more to me than--than I
can say to have all of you here today.

516
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:40,710
And now, uh,our son gregory
would like to say a few words.

517
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,870
Greg?

518
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:06,920
There's a lot of people here today.

519
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:09,990
Including some from the corps.

520
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:15,670
And I notice that every one of them
is either my father's rank or higher.

521
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,450
And that doesn't surprise me.

522
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:26,770
Because if the test of a man is how
he treats those he has power over,

523
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:32,090
it was a test my father failed.

524
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:37,340
This man you're eager to pay homage to,

525
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:42,260
he was incapable of admitting any
point of view but his own.

526
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:47,010
He punished failure, and he did
not accept anything less than--

527
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:01,790
he loved doing what he did.

528
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:05,940
He saw his work as some kind of...

529
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,110
sacred calling.

530
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,820
More important than any
personal relationship.

531
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:20,160
Maybe if he'd been a better
father, I'd be a better son.

532
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:25,460
But I am what I am because of him...

533
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:28,850
for better or for worse.

534
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:33,590
And I just--I just wish--

535
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,720
Put it back.

536
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,180
Well, he's not gonna miss it.

537
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:14,700
I'm done enabling.

538
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:18,530
You can't even let them put him in the
ground without making it serve your agenda?

539
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,750
you really want to do
this in front of everybody?

540
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,980
You wanna punish me or them?

541
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,510
How can I still feel surprise?

542
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:43,660
You would take,even this, a moment of
real human grief, and turn it into a farce.

543
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,670
Oh, cut the crap.

544
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,340
You enjoy what I do.

545
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:48,370
I never had to force you.

546
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,910
You like coming along for the ride.

547
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:52,000
Yes, that's why I'm cheering you on now.

548
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:55,360
This is about you needing to
be prepared for the worst.

549
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:57,380
So you become an oncologist.

550
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,030
No surprises there. Worst
happens all the time.

551
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,260
But amber, she was young and healthy.

552
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,620
Her death came out of nowhere.

553
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:05,260
Don't bring amber into this.

554
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:07,890
And you weren't ready.
That makes you angry.

555
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,270
The world sucks, and you
didn't have time to brace yourself.

556
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,620
What happened out there is your show!

557
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:15,100
You're scared to death of
losing anyone that matters.

558
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:17,130
So you dump the person who
matters the most to you!

559
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:19,480
I'm not scared to death.
I'm moving forward!

560
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:22,970
Because no one can take away
from you what you no longer have.

561
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,590
Your father's death is about you.

562
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,150
Amber's death is about you.

563
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:29,320
I can't imagine why someone wouldn't
want to be your friend!

564
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:32,700
Admit it, you're angry and
you're scared of losing me.

565
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:35,180
- I'm not angry, I'm not scared.
- Admit it.

566
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,450
- I'm not afraid.
- Admit it.

567
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,810
- I've lost people. It happens.
- Admit it. Admit it!

568
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,510
What are you,five? Stop repeating--

569
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:45,820
admit it. Admit it. Admit it. Admit it. Admit it.
Admit it. Admit it. Come on, admit it. Admit it!

570
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,730
Still not boring.

571
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,630
did you know I was gonna do that?

572
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,410
Because I didn't know I
was gonna do that.

573
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:03,280
I know you have trouble losing people.

574
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:08,350
In new orleans, I saw you carrying this
express package around the conference.

575
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:12,020
And you wouldn't let it
go,but you wouldn't open it.

576
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,400
So I peeked at the return address.

577
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,190
Diamond, fairbairn.

578
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,190
Divorce attorneys.

579
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,360
Your first wife had just
served you with papers.

580
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:22,910
Did you know that when you bailed me out?

581
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,160
Were you... doing something nice for me?

582
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:28,920
What did I say about being boring?

583
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:32,400
We owe your mom an apology.

584
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,580
Hello? It's House.

585
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:37,990
How'd the bubble test go?

586
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,740
The problem wasn't the cyst. It's
advanced dilated cardiomyopathy.

587
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:43,620
We did a three-dimensional echo.
Showed a mass in the left atrium.

588
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:47,150
looks like an atrial myxoma, but the
ultrasound images are a little grainy,

589
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:49,040
so it's hard to tell.

590
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:50,450
House?

591
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:52,030
The images aren't grainy.

592
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,460
They sure look grainy.

593
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:56,150
I've seen pictures of
you where you look tall.

594
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,600
It's iron overload.

595
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:59,800
Creates speckles on the
image,mas it look grainy.

596
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:02,850
Also makes her pancreas fail, her
blood clot, and her intestine--

597
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,560
atrial myxoma is more likely.

598
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,140
Mri for a better view.

599
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,880
And call me back and tell me you're embarrassed
because my eyesight is better 500 miles away.

600
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:13,750
I need a phone number.

601
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,000
I'm a doctor in new
jersey,treating one of your clients.

602
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:25,620
A young woman looking for
her biological parents.

603
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:29,880
You know, you could just wait for the
mri to have your curiosity satisfied.

604
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:34,660
What person who is nothing
like me are you saying that to?

605
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:37,260
Did the parents look tan?

606
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:40,440
The disease she has is genetic,
which means they should have it too.

607
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,510
They don't look more
tan than anyone else.

608
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:43,660
Discolored teeth?

609
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:46,360
They're farmers--the
village doesn't even have a dentist.

610
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,620
Right. Thanks.

611
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:52,280
But if it matters, I'm not
convinced they were her parents.

612
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,010
Why not?

613
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:55,000
Because they said they have no daughter.

614
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:58,470
The man was adamant, and the woman
seemed confused and frightened.

615
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:01,000
Thank you.

616
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,270
Differential.

617
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:07,210
Say you're a middle-aged
chinese woman...

618
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,070
- fine.
- Say it.

619
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,180
I'm a middle-aged chinese woman.

620
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:14,810
Girl comes to you, says that
she's your long-lost daughter.

621
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,270
Why would you be frightened?

622
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:20,630
I'm frightened because she's a threat?

623
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,510
Maybe she knows something?

624
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:25,230
She hasn't seen you
since she was an infant.

625
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,880
Maybe an inheritance issue.

626
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,060
They're peasants.

627
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:32,240
Her very presence is a threat.

628
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:35,580
She--what year was she born?

629
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:36,970
'83.

630
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:39,740
She's not supposed to be alive.

631
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,630
China introduced the
one-child policy in 1979.

632
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:46,050
Say they didn't want a girl.

633
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,620
They tried to kill her.

634
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:51,080
Maybe the baby doesn't die. Maybe
the father panics or regrets it.

635
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:54,900
Takes the baby to an orphanage.
Maybe he doesn't tell his wife.

636
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:59,090
Who freaks out like she's seen a ghost
25 years later when the girl shows up.

637
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:03,540
Why does attempted murder from 25 years ago
suddenly become relevant to her health now?

638
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,760
Maybe they gave her something toxic.

639
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:08,800
It would have to be fat soluble.

640
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,010
This is fun, isn't it?

641
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,570
Let me see the mri.

642
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,560
We don't have one.

643
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:24,520
She started vomiting as
soon as we started the scan.

644
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:26,700
Then let her vomit through the mri.

645
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,040
That's what nurses are for.

646
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:32,300
Her parents tried to kill her.

647
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:38,510
I don't know how, but I know it caused her to
get sick 25 years later trying to lift a buddha.

648
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,760
Explain.

649
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:43,970
I already had this conversation with
wilson--just go with it.

650
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,200
Poison?

651
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,490
Buddha wouldn't make it worse.

652
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,170
Maybe the weight stressed
her back, which--

653
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:51,280
makes sense if she's
never lifted anything in her life.

654
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:54,550
She actually didn't get sick till she
tried lifting it that second time.

655
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:57,280
I'm guessing the weight changed.

656
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,260
Anybody have taub's pager number?

657
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,610
What's up?

658
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,260
Maybe give him a call.

659
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,620
If he tosses that switch on
the mri, she's dead.

660
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,810
X-ray her brain.

661
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,460
pins.

662
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,620
Push them through the
soft fontanelle of an infant,

663
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,530
you skewer the brain,and the
hair hides the entry wounds.

664
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,960
It's the perfect crime.

665
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,600
She's had them in her all these years.

666
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,770
What changed at the temple?

667
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:26,990
Same thing that changed in the mri.

668
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:29,540
shockingly, not all religious
leaders are honest.

669
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:34,090
I'm guessing these particular monks are bilking
the faithful by pushing a magnet up buddha's butt.

670
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:37,990
There's another one under the table that'll
repel or attract,depending on how you shift them.

671
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:39,740
When she picked up that magnet,

672
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,130
it moved one of the pins deeper into the
sympathetic nervous center of her brain.

673
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:47,210
This sent a signal through the nerves to
the blood vessels in her small intestine

674
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:51,830
which caused the symptoms in china
and in the giant magnet we call an mri.

675
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:54,460
She's lucky.

676
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:56,770
We're all screwed up by our parents.

677
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:59,390
She's got documentation.

678
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:05,330
The pins will be removed
surgically, and she'll be fine.

679
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:08,180
We'll wake her from the
coma after the operation.

680
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:11,510
Is there any way you could not tell her?

681
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:14,360
Please. She's fragile.

682
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:18,300
She desperately wanted to
know her biological parents.

683
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,660
For her to find out that
they wanted her dead...

684
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:23,600
I don't know what that'll do to her.

685
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:26,050
She may not be as fragile as you think.

686
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,490
We know our daughter.

687
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:30,840
See this pin here?

688
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:34,030
It's been pressing directly on
her addiction center.

689
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:37,110
It's not her fault. And it's
definitely not your fault.

690
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,670
She's not who you think she is.

691
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,370
I hear your patient's gonna be all right.

692
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:03,840
Is that why you're here?

693
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:07,250
A colleague checking up on a patient?

694
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:10,620
Something goin' on?

695
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:13,090
I'm celebrating.

696
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:23,490
My mom hated him too.

697
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,930
Your dna test showed no
match? That's incredible.

698
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:31,900
At the age of 12, you actually figured
out your father wasn't your birth father?

699
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:35,380
That's what you wanted,wasn't it?

700
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:37,020
Why should it depress you?

701
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,860
It doesn't depress me.

702
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:41,120
Doesn't make any difference at all.

703
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:43,910
That's what depresses me.

704
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:51,870
Well, I guess nobody gets to
choose who their parents are.

705
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:58,420
I'm not even sure anymore if we
get to choose who our friends are.

706
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:07,430
I spoke with Cuddy. She
hasn't filled my position yet.

707
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:14,070
If you're coming back just because you're
attracted to the shine of my neediness...

708
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:18,850
I'd be okay with that.

709
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:24,070
I'm coming back because you're right.

710
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:30,500
That strange, annoying trip we just took
was the most fun I've had since amber died.

711
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:36,420
You hungry?

712
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:48,490
- Wilson.
- Yeah?

713
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:54,160
My dad's dead.

714
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:58,340
Yeah. My sympathies.
