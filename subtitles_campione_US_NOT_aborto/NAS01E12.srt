1
00:00:00,027 --> 00:00:01,376
Previously, on "New Amsterdam"...

2
00:00:01,394 --> 00:00:03,529
- Dr. Bloom.
- Dr. Bloom?

3
00:00:03,554 --> 00:00:05,054
The last few weeks, I've been taking

4
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:07,623
a little bit more Adderall
than prescribed.

5
00:00:07,658 --> 00:00:09,725
- I think you may need help.
- I'm just tired...

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,094
Mr. Powell could have died.

7
00:00:15,566 --> 00:00:17,700
Run the Cardiac Surgical Department.

8
00:00:17,734 --> 00:00:18,935
There is no Cardiac Surgical Department.

9
00:00:18,969 --> 00:00:20,636
Then build one.

10
00:00:20,671 --> 00:00:23,135
When we aim high-energy
external beam radiation

11
00:00:23,169 --> 00:00:24,501
at the cancer in your throat,

12
00:00:24,535 --> 00:00:26,102
if you move then, you die.

13
00:00:26,136 --> 00:00:28,611
I don't want everyone to see me so weak.

14
00:00:28,645 --> 00:00:30,239
The answer's yes, Max.

15
00:00:30,273 --> 00:00:32,248
I'll be your deputy.

16
00:00:43,093 --> 00:00:44,883
I don't even know

17
00:00:44,918 --> 00:00:46,302
what some of this stuff is.

18
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:49,265
Babe, I-I didn't know we had
so many friends.

19
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,342
This is a return, right?

20
00:00:51,376 --> 00:00:52,768
- No way.
- No?

21
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:54,237
Cloth diapers are way better
for the environment.

22
00:00:54,271 --> 00:00:56,294
Yeah, but disposable diapers
are way better

23
00:00:56,328 --> 00:00:57,773
for sleeping in on Sunday.

24
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:00,076
- Fine, maybe pile.
- Maybe pile.

25
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,845
It's very cute that you think
you're sleeping in on Sundays.

26
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,581
Yeah. Electric snot sucker? Return.

27
00:01:05,616 --> 00:01:08,251
How do you suggest we remove snot
from our baby's nasal passages?

28
00:01:08,285 --> 00:01:09,752
The old-fashioned way.

29
00:01:09,786 --> 00:01:10,920
You put your mouth on that nose
and you...

30
00:01:10,954 --> 00:01:12,121
That's disgusting!

31
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,790
- Keeping.
- Babe, I'm just saying...

32
00:01:16,193 --> 00:01:19,929
What about a baby... a baby blender?

33
00:01:19,963 --> 00:01:22,518
That's a maybe. I mean, we
don't have an adult blender.

34
00:01:22,552 --> 00:01:24,367
All right, well,
the Swedish here says, uh...

35
00:01:28,071 --> 00:01:29,772
Oh, well, in that case...

36
00:01:29,806 --> 00:01:31,107
- Mm.
- Return.

37
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:32,775
Return. Yeah.

38
00:01:37,214 --> 00:01:39,615
Oh, babe, more nausea?

39
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:42,385
Mm. Mm-hmm.

40
00:01:42,419 --> 00:01:44,120
Hey, I thought Helen said

41
00:01:44,154 --> 00:01:47,189
that you wouldn't experience
chemo nausea so soon.

42
00:01:47,224 --> 00:01:50,159
Well, maybe I'm, uh...

43
00:01:52,216 --> 00:01:53,383
Maybe I'm special.

44
00:01:53,417 --> 00:01:56,119
Maybe you should stay home.

45
00:01:56,153 --> 00:01:58,227
Mm-hmm. Mm-mm.

46
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,790
I'm good.

47
00:02:00,825 --> 00:02:02,225
I'm already over it.

48
00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:03,827
It's fine.

49
00:02:03,861 --> 00:02:05,361
I'm raring to go.

50
00:02:05,396 --> 00:02:07,464
I'm not gonna let
a little cancer slow me down.

51
00:02:07,498 --> 00:02:09,199
I'm fine.

52
00:02:10,688 --> 00:02:11,693
Ow!

54
00:02:16,907 --> 00:02:18,202
How can I help?

55
00:02:18,236 --> 00:02:20,343
Figured out why the old
Cardio Department lost its way:

56
00:02:20,377 --> 00:02:22,145
Our conflict of interest policy.

57
00:02:22,179 --> 00:02:23,847
- What's wrong with it?
- Well, we don't have one.

58
00:02:23,881 --> 00:02:25,215
Big pharma could buy me an island,

59
00:02:25,249 --> 00:02:26,912
- and no one would know.
- Could be fun.

60
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:28,785
We should mandate total transparency.

61
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:30,353
Uh, how many other hospitals do this?

62
00:02:30,387 --> 00:02:32,489
- Zero.
- I guess we'll be the first.

63
00:02:32,523 --> 00:02:34,090
In clinical trials,

64
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:35,525
do you know what you want
in ideal candidates?

65
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:37,060
Ooh, I know this one. Sick people?

66
00:02:37,094 --> 00:02:38,428
- Diversity.
- Yeah.

67
00:02:38,462 --> 00:02:40,263
Our candidates need to be as diverse

68
00:02:40,297 --> 00:02:41,898
as the country we're aiming to treat.

69
00:02:41,932 --> 00:02:43,647
Yeah, so what's the problem?

70
00:02:44,535 --> 00:02:47,871
The country I'm trying
to treat isn't Finland.

71
00:02:47,905 --> 00:02:49,873
Hmm.

72
00:02:49,907 --> 00:02:51,541
I can see that.

73
00:02:51,575 --> 00:02:53,076
Yeah.

74
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,878
I'll make some calls.

75
00:02:54,912 --> 00:02:56,446
More glitter, right? Okay, yes.

76
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,182
So New York has seen a spike
in Polynesian refugees

77
00:02:59,216 --> 00:03:00,884
because their countries are, you know,

78
00:03:00,918 --> 00:03:02,519
- sinking into the Pacific Ocean.
- Right.

79
00:03:02,553 --> 00:03:04,354
Not a lot of them speak English...

80
00:03:04,388 --> 00:03:06,523
like these little cuties right
here from Tuvalu, aren't you?

81
00:03:06,557 --> 00:03:07,957
Imagine I just said
"how can I help?" in Tuvaluan.

82
00:03:07,992 --> 00:03:09,392
I wish I could, but I can't,

83
00:03:09,426 --> 00:03:11,227
because nobody speaks Tuvaluan
in New York...

84
00:03:11,262 --> 00:03:12,529
literally, like, less than 20 people.

85
00:03:12,563 --> 00:03:14,030
I need a translator.

86
00:03:14,064 --> 00:03:16,966
Oh, okay.

87
00:03:17,001 --> 00:03:18,535
So I just learned the word for "potty."

88
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:20,370
- Oh, did you?
- But I'm gonna take off.

89
00:03:20,404 --> 00:03:23,473
Okay. Oh, oh. Gladys!

90
00:03:23,507 --> 00:03:26,142
My department was just flagged by HCC

91
00:03:26,177 --> 00:03:28,244
for "disproportionately
providing coverage

92
00:03:28,279 --> 00:03:31,915
to patients ineligible
for Medicaid and for..."

93
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:33,383
Solved.

94
00:03:33,417 --> 00:03:34,651
Thought that was gonna go in.

95
00:03:34,685 --> 00:03:36,152
Still solved. Pretend it went in.

96
00:03:36,187 --> 00:03:37,887
But they said they would cap my budget...

97
00:03:37,922 --> 00:03:39,422
It doesn't matter.

98
00:03:39,456 --> 00:03:41,057
We treat everybody here,
and if they're not covered,

99
00:03:41,091 --> 00:03:42,158
if they're covered, it doesn't matter.

100
00:03:42,193 --> 00:03:43,426
The price...

101
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,094
We treat everyone.

102
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:46,896
That's the power of New Amsterdam.

103
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:48,898
Excuse me.

104
00:03:50,935 --> 00:03:53,069
- Max, are you okay?
- Yeah.

105
00:03:53,103 --> 00:03:55,338
Ooh.

106
00:03:55,372 --> 00:03:57,640
Max, you want us to wait for you?

107
00:04:02,313 --> 00:04:04,314
Oh, God, what is the medical term

108
00:04:04,348 --> 00:04:05,682
for "barfed my face off"?

109
00:04:05,716 --> 00:04:07,617
This isn't a great time.

110
00:04:07,651 --> 00:04:09,252
You don't even know
what just came out of me.

111
00:04:09,286 --> 00:04:11,955
I'm not just talking quantity,
I'm talking quality.

112
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:14,958
I mean, what the heck
could I have possibly eaten...

113
00:04:14,992 --> 00:04:17,160
- Max.
- What?

114
00:04:19,296 --> 00:04:21,698
This is a consortium of top oncologists

115
00:04:21,732 --> 00:04:25,435
being hosted by a WHO facility in Haiti.

116
00:04:25,469 --> 00:04:28,605
Everyone, this is Dr. Goodwin,
our Medical Director.

117
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,007
How you doing?

118
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,375
- Hello.
- Hello.

119
00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:34,611
Let's pick this up in 15, shall we?

120
00:04:36,313 --> 00:04:38,114
- Sorry about that.
- It's fine.

121
00:04:38,148 --> 00:04:40,049
I'm consulting
on a very challenging case.

122
00:04:40,084 --> 00:04:41,985
A digression about the texture
of your vomit

123
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:44,020
was just the mood-lightener
that we needed.

124
00:04:44,054 --> 00:04:45,435
Happy to help.

125
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,992
And you need anti-nausea meds.

126
00:04:49,026 --> 00:04:50,440
Mm-hmm.

127
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:54,277
This is harder than I thought.

128
00:04:55,232 --> 00:04:57,133
Silver lining?

129
00:04:57,167 --> 00:04:58,735
When we start radiation tonight,

130
00:04:58,769 --> 00:05:01,571
your throat's gonna be too sore
to eat anything.

131
00:05:01,605 --> 00:05:02,672
Mm.

132
00:05:02,706 --> 00:05:04,641
Less nausea.

133
00:05:07,444 --> 00:05:10,146
So you'd walk by,
and you'd see all this smoke

134
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,981
seeping out from under the door.

135
00:05:12,016 --> 00:05:13,483
But it wasn't a fire.

136
00:05:13,517 --> 00:05:15,585
It was the cardiologists' smoking lounge.

137
00:05:15,619 --> 00:05:16,989
In the hospital?

138
00:05:17,024 --> 00:05:18,588
Yes, Building C.

139
00:05:18,622 --> 00:05:20,490
Third floor.

140
00:05:20,524 --> 00:05:22,659
They had the fire department
called on them

141
00:05:22,693 --> 00:05:24,494
at least twice a month.

142
00:05:24,528 --> 00:05:26,362
I can't believe you've never
told me that one before.

143
00:05:26,397 --> 00:05:28,031
It was a different time.

144
00:05:28,065 --> 00:05:29,666
It's just a wonder
more patients didn't die.

145
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,167
Yeah, no kidding... oh.

146
00:05:31,201 --> 00:05:32,735
No, it's okay. It's okay, I got it.

147
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,407
No, no, no, I got it. Henry, it's cool.

148
00:05:34,848 --> 00:05:37,654
- Thanks.
- I've been trained for such situations.

149
00:05:38,242 --> 00:05:40,009
Just got to get the big chunks, right?

150
00:05:40,044 --> 00:05:41,210
- Yeah...
- Thanks.

151
00:05:41,245 --> 00:05:42,378
Kick the rest under the table.

152
00:05:42,413 --> 00:05:44,247
Clumsy.

153
00:05:44,281 --> 00:05:46,182
You know, my, uh...

154
00:05:46,216 --> 00:05:49,252
my intern days were totally tame.

155
00:05:49,286 --> 00:05:51,721
I-I don't have any
crazy stories, you know.

156
00:05:51,755 --> 00:05:54,290
Oh, don't be so sure.

157
00:05:54,325 --> 00:05:56,125
Those memories will come flooding back

158
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,593
once you're my age.

159
00:05:57,628 --> 00:05:59,462
For example, I have
a temporal bone surgery

160
00:05:59,496 --> 00:06:00,530
scheduled tomorrow.

161
00:06:00,564 --> 00:06:01,764
Now, back in the day,

162
00:06:01,799 --> 00:06:03,566
we wouldn't even consider operating

163
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,301
until we could see discoloration

164
00:06:05,336 --> 00:06:07,637
in the neck and the jawline.

165
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:09,405
Oh.

166
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,240
That's crazy.

167
00:06:20,451 --> 00:06:22,385
- Okay.
- Thank you so much.

168
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:23,820
- Lauren.
- I'm late.

169
00:06:23,854 --> 00:06:25,368
Lauren...

170
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,558
I am deeply sorry.

171
00:06:28,592 --> 00:06:29,792
If you would just hear me out...

172
00:06:29,827 --> 00:06:32,395
You rooted through my bag for drugs

173
00:06:32,429 --> 00:06:35,465
after I explicitly told you
that I was clean.

174
00:06:35,499 --> 00:06:37,233
You just couldn't trust me, could you?

175
00:06:37,267 --> 00:06:40,470
It's not that simple, and you know it.

176
00:06:40,504 --> 00:06:42,405
I was concerned.

177
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:44,340
I overstepped. What I wanted...

178
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:45,775
We were friends.

179
00:06:45,809 --> 00:06:47,477
- We still are.
- How?

180
00:06:49,613 --> 00:06:51,647
You asked for help.

181
00:06:51,682 --> 00:06:53,649
You admitted you needed help.

182
00:06:53,684 --> 00:06:55,351
Let me help you.

183
00:06:55,386 --> 00:06:56,819
How about this?

184
00:06:56,854 --> 00:06:59,288
From now on, you stay
on your side of the hospital.

185
00:06:59,323 --> 00:07:01,324
I'll stay on mine.

186
00:07:05,462 --> 00:07:07,764
Oh, hi.

187
00:07:12,336 --> 00:07:13,803
Max?

188
00:07:13,837 --> 00:07:15,772
Hey, Dora told me
I could find you in here.

189
00:07:15,806 --> 00:07:18,107
- Yeah.
- Oh, okay.

190
00:07:18,142 --> 00:07:19,275
Uh...

191
00:07:19,309 --> 00:07:21,144
that's all right. I can wait.

192
00:07:21,178 --> 00:07:23,279
Oh...

193
00:07:28,252 --> 00:07:30,183
- Hey.
- How can I...

194
00:07:31,321 --> 00:07:32,889
Yeah, okay. Yeah, I got it.

195
00:07:32,923 --> 00:07:35,158
So, um, let's say, hypothetically,

196
00:07:35,192 --> 00:07:36,793
I have a friend here at the hospital.

197
00:07:36,827 --> 00:07:39,295
Let's call him, uh, Dr. Dre.

198
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:40,730
Mm.

199
00:07:40,764 --> 00:07:43,366
And, uh, what if he kind of,
sort of maybe...

200
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,836
shouldn't probably be
performing surgeries anymore?

201
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,505
We're not having
an unofficial conversation

202
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,574
about an impaired physician, Iggy.

203
00:07:51,608 --> 00:07:53,509
We have a system.

204
00:07:53,544 --> 00:07:55,478
I know.

205
00:07:55,512 --> 00:07:57,680
I just don't want to ruin
anyone's career, you know?

206
00:07:57,714 --> 00:07:59,348
Well, if you're concerned enough

207
00:07:59,383 --> 00:08:02,196
to bring it to me here,
then it has to be official.

208
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,323
All right?

209
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,521
No half reports, no pseudonyms.

210
00:08:05,556 --> 00:08:07,557
By the way, maybe pick a better one.

211
00:08:07,591 --> 00:08:09,325
- I know.
- Just tell me what's going on

212
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:11,327
so I can investigate the doctor properly.

213
00:08:11,361 --> 00:08:14,330
Come on, man. Can't we just
hypothesize about it

214
00:08:14,364 --> 00:08:15,832
for a little while longer?

215
00:08:15,866 --> 00:08:19,769
Iggy, your name will be
kept confidential, I swear.

216
00:08:23,874 --> 00:08:25,905
It's Dr. Maravich.

217
00:08:26,777 --> 00:08:28,511
What's going on?

218
00:08:28,545 --> 00:08:30,546
¡Ayúdennos, por favor!

219
00:08:30,581 --> 00:08:32,381
¡Él está enfermo!

220
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,183
- Do... do you speak English?
- Yes, yes, yes!

221
00:08:34,218 --> 00:08:35,518
Please, you have to help him!
He needs help!

222
00:08:35,552 --> 00:08:37,286
Severe dehydration.

223
00:08:37,321 --> 00:08:38,621
Okay, let's get him over
to Bay 27 for a workup.

224
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,556
- What's your name?
- Ivan Velez.

225
00:08:40,591 --> 00:08:42,725
- Ivan, how do you know him?
- Uh, Miguel, we are brothers.

226
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:43,993
- You must help him, please!
- He feels hot.

227
00:08:44,028 --> 00:08:45,394
Ivan, look at me.

228
00:08:45,429 --> 00:08:46,696
How long has he been sick like this?

229
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:47,864
Uh, about a week.

230
00:08:47,898 --> 00:08:49,265
He started shivering, and he...

231
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:50,700
he couldn't, uh, drink or eat anything.

232
00:08:50,734 --> 00:08:53,141
We thought he needed sleep,
but it only got worse.

233
00:08:54,304 --> 00:08:56,272
Does it hurt to swallow?

234
00:08:56,306 --> 00:08:58,374
- You have to help him!
- I'll do everything I can.

235
00:08:58,408 --> 00:09:00,409
Bloom, lymphs are swollen.

236
00:09:00,444 --> 00:09:02,378
Okay, open for me?

237
00:09:04,348 --> 00:09:06,816
What? What do you see?

238
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,584
He needs an FNA, ASAP.

239
00:09:08,619 --> 00:09:10,987
- Who's on call for oncology?
- Dr. Sharpe.

240
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:18,345
Daddy, who is that man?

241
00:09:18,379 --> 00:09:19,959
Shh.

242
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:24,017
My name is Dr. Kapoor.

243
00:09:24,052 --> 00:09:25,385
I'm going to help your mom.

244
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,820
She can't see.

245
00:09:26,855 --> 00:09:28,755
Her eyes are broken.

246
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,424
Then I'll try to fix them.

247
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,326
Let's find a healthy snack, kiddo.

248
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,527
Yeah.

249
00:09:33,561 --> 00:09:35,562
We'll be just outside.

250
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:40,188
I see from your records, Maren...

251
00:09:41,369 --> 00:09:43,901
- you've had a rough time.
- Yeah.

252
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:46,940
My organs, they shut down
during Violet's birth.

253
00:09:46,975 --> 00:09:48,275
I couldn't stop bleeding.

254
00:09:48,309 --> 00:09:52,079
I was in the ICU for, uh, nine months.

255
00:09:52,113 --> 00:09:54,348
Ian had to make arrangements.

256
00:09:54,382 --> 00:09:56,049
Just in case.

257
00:09:56,084 --> 00:09:58,118
- But you survived.
- Mm-hmm.

258
00:09:58,152 --> 00:09:59,749
Well, most of me.

259
00:10:00,321 --> 00:10:04,379
So you developed an adenoma
at the base of your brain.

260
00:10:05,093 --> 00:10:07,854
It's pressing on the optic chiasm
and causing your blindness.

261
00:10:07,888 --> 00:10:10,964
Yeah, and everyone says
they can't remove it

262
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:13,934
because I can't have anesthesia
'cause of my liver.

263
00:10:13,968 --> 00:10:14,968
That's right.

264
00:10:15,003 --> 00:10:17,037
But there is a new treatment...

265
00:10:17,071 --> 00:10:18,405
non-surgical.

266
00:10:18,439 --> 00:10:21,354
I won't even need to break the skin.

267
00:10:22,143 --> 00:10:23,310
How?

268
00:10:23,344 --> 00:10:25,979
It's MRI-guided focused ultrasound...

269
00:10:26,014 --> 00:10:29,696
noninvasive, no anesthesia.

270
00:10:30,351 --> 00:10:31,618
Just one catch.

271
00:10:31,653 --> 00:10:33,153
Yeah.

272
00:10:33,187 --> 00:10:35,556
There's always a catch.

273
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,324
Before I can address your brain tumor,

274
00:10:37,358 --> 00:10:39,426
we need to replace one
of your heart valves

275
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,995
also weakened by Violet's birth.

276
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,997
But I'm sure my colleague, Dr. Reynolds,

277
00:10:44,032 --> 00:10:46,633
can do that without anesthesia as well.

278
00:10:48,469 --> 00:10:50,637
Wow.

279
00:10:52,307 --> 00:10:55,275
I would love to see my daughter's face.

280
00:10:58,012 --> 00:11:00,280
I would love to see her eyes. I would.

281
00:11:06,988 --> 00:11:08,255
Hi.

282
00:11:08,289 --> 00:11:10,157
I got your page.

283
00:11:10,191 --> 00:11:11,625
Yeah.

284
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:21,034
Mr. Velez?

285
00:11:21,069 --> 00:11:22,636
This is Dr. Sharpe.

286
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,338
She's gonna biopsy your brother's throat

287
00:11:24,372 --> 00:11:26,544
so we can figure out
what's making him so sick.

288
00:11:29,077 --> 00:11:30,544
Open up for me, Mr. Velez.

289
00:11:30,578 --> 00:11:33,259
Arroyo. His name is Miguel Arroyo.

290
00:11:33,982 --> 00:11:35,382
I thought you guys were brothers.

291
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:36,483
We're like brothers.

292
00:11:36,517 --> 00:11:38,018
You know, we are Boricua.

293
00:11:38,052 --> 00:11:39,653
We grew up a town apart on La Isla,

294
00:11:39,687 --> 00:11:43,123
but we never knew each other
until we came to New York.

295
00:11:43,157 --> 00:11:44,558
When did you move here?

296
00:11:44,592 --> 00:11:46,560
Hurricane Maria took everything.

297
00:11:46,594 --> 00:11:49,463
My home was washed away,
and no one was coming to help.

298
00:11:49,497 --> 00:11:52,612
So I left to find work
so I could rebuild one day.

299
00:11:53,201 --> 00:11:55,969
Took any job I could get...
construction, picking apples.

300
00:11:56,004 --> 00:11:58,905
And that's where I met Miguel...
on a farm upstate.

301
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,408
- El destino.
- Sí.

302
00:12:01,442 --> 00:12:04,244
We both lost everything but faith.

303
00:12:04,278 --> 00:12:07,014
She brought us together
to protect each other.

304
00:12:07,048 --> 00:12:08,649
You see? So we are more than friends.

305
00:12:08,683 --> 00:12:10,508
Hermano.

306
00:12:17,697 --> 00:12:18,992
Ah... specimen cup.

307
00:12:19,027 --> 00:12:20,310
Here.

308
00:12:33,141 --> 00:12:35,108
Admin sent me about a nameplate?

309
00:12:35,143 --> 00:12:37,277
Oh, yes.

310
00:12:37,311 --> 00:12:39,212
Great. Thank you.

311
00:12:39,247 --> 00:12:40,714
I've been calling for a month.

312
00:12:40,748 --> 00:12:42,516
Just tell me what you need, Dr. Merritt.

313
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,284
No, actually, I'm, uh, Dr. Reynolds.

314
00:12:44,318 --> 00:12:46,286
Oh. Nameplate says "Merritt."

315
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,523
Right, and I want it
replaced with "Reynolds."

316
00:12:49,557 --> 00:12:51,291
- "Dr. Reynolds"?
- Correct.

317
00:12:51,325 --> 00:12:52,626
Okay, gonna have to get

318
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,294
the Chair or Cardiothoracic Surgery

319
00:12:54,328 --> 00:12:55,762
to sign off on a request like that.

320
00:12:55,797 --> 00:12:57,364
Not a problem.

321
00:12:57,398 --> 00:12:58,465
I'm the Chair of Cardiothoracic Surgery.

322
00:12:58,499 --> 00:12:59,466
Dr. Merritt.

323
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,268
No, Dr. Reynolds.

324
00:13:01,302 --> 00:13:02,636
Well, it says Dr. Merritt's the Chair.

325
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,629
Well, he's not. I'm the Chair.

326
00:13:04,664 --> 00:13:06,169
Well, then why are you in his office?

327
00:13:06,204 --> 00:13:07,537
This is my...

328
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:11,478
Um... you see how confusing this is?

329
00:13:11,512 --> 00:13:13,313
Well, I have this same conversation

330
00:13:13,347 --> 00:13:14,715
with every patient that comes in here,

331
00:13:14,749 --> 00:13:16,316
which doesn't help them to be confident

332
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,051
in the doctor they chose to cut them open

333
00:13:18,086 --> 00:13:20,754
because he can't even get
his name on the door.

334
00:13:20,788 --> 00:13:23,623
Yeah, I'm thinking you might
need a new nameplate.

335
00:13:25,193 --> 00:13:26,539
Yeah.

336
00:13:30,832 --> 00:13:32,545
Henry.

337
00:13:33,434 --> 00:13:35,962
Chemo stomach. It's no joke.

338
00:13:35,996 --> 00:13:37,163
You're telling me.

339
00:13:37,197 --> 00:13:39,052
- Thanks for coming.
- Sure.

340
00:13:39,841 --> 00:13:41,408
You know what this room used to be?

341
00:13:41,442 --> 00:13:43,343
Mm, I think legal had it?

342
00:13:43,377 --> 00:13:45,479
Well, the fun part
is who had it before legal.

343
00:13:45,513 --> 00:13:46,574
Hmm.

344
00:13:46,609 --> 00:13:49,583
In '67, we'd call this
the "Nookie Closet."

345
00:13:49,617 --> 00:13:50,684
Did you?

346
00:13:50,718 --> 00:13:52,519
Now it's a stone's throw from HR,

347
00:13:52,553 --> 00:13:54,521
so why don't we let that one
sail right by?

348
00:13:54,555 --> 00:13:56,036
You mind if we get right to it?

349
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,396
Not at all.

350
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,698
I'd like to schedule you
for a medical evaluation.

351
00:14:01,529 --> 00:14:03,497
Nothing wrong with my health,
Dr. Goodwin.

352
00:14:03,531 --> 00:14:05,766
Just consider it a formality.

353
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,300
Okay?

354
00:14:07,335 --> 00:14:09,603
This hospital requires a medical eval

355
00:14:09,637 --> 00:14:11,638
every two years.

356
00:14:11,672 --> 00:14:14,374
I passed my last exam
less than a year ago...

357
00:14:14,408 --> 00:14:16,042
with flying colors, I might add.

358
00:14:16,077 --> 00:14:17,644
I don't like it any more than you do,

359
00:14:17,678 --> 00:14:20,093
but it is my job.

360
00:14:21,549 --> 00:14:24,618
I've been in practice
for more than 40 years...

361
00:14:24,652 --> 00:14:26,686
all of them here.

362
00:14:26,721 --> 00:14:28,822
I can do my surgeries blindfolded.

363
00:14:28,856 --> 00:14:31,057
I appreciate that, Henry.

364
00:14:31,092 --> 00:14:33,160
I do, but I would still like
to schedule you

365
00:14:33,194 --> 00:14:34,828
for a routine eval.

366
00:14:38,266 --> 00:14:39,566
Tomorrow.

367
00:14:41,702 --> 00:14:43,403
Of course.

368
00:14:43,437 --> 00:14:45,471
You got to do your job.

369
00:14:51,612 --> 00:14:53,880
So you need me to perform
a valve replacement

370
00:14:53,915 --> 00:14:55,882
so that you can do
an MRI-focused ultrasound.

371
00:14:55,917 --> 00:14:58,506
- It shouldn't be a problem.
- Keep scrolling.

372
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,522
Oh, your patient
can't withstand anesthesia.

373
00:15:02,557 --> 00:15:04,324
That's right, but if I can
perform a procedure

374
00:15:04,358 --> 00:15:06,426
on the brain without anesthesia,

375
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,428
you can certainly do
the same thing for the heart.

376
00:15:08,462 --> 00:15:10,197
Yeah, the only noninvasive surgery

377
00:15:10,231 --> 00:15:12,332
is catheter aortic replacement therapy.

378
00:15:12,366 --> 00:15:13,433
Yes, do that.

379
00:15:13,467 --> 00:15:14,768
Which requires a C-ART device,

380
00:15:14,802 --> 00:15:16,570
which New Amsterdam does not have.

381
00:15:16,604 --> 00:15:17,904
So we'll get one.

382
00:15:17,939 --> 00:15:20,173
Yeah, sure. "So we'll get one."

383
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,709
A C-ART device costs $3 million.

384
00:15:22,743 --> 00:15:24,578
I made Maren Thompson a promise

385
00:15:24,612 --> 00:15:26,880
that I would help her see her daughter.

386
00:15:26,914 --> 00:15:29,249
I'll get you this device.

387
00:15:29,283 --> 00:15:30,717
Okay, Guruji, look,

388
00:15:30,751 --> 00:15:34,287
I can't even get my name
on my own door, all right?

389
00:15:34,322 --> 00:15:36,890
They're not gonna just buy you
a $3 million device.

390
00:15:36,924 --> 00:15:38,625
We will see about that.

391
00:15:44,231 --> 00:15:47,200
Uh, remember when you told
me we'll treat everyone here

392
00:15:47,235 --> 00:15:48,401
no matter the price?

393
00:15:48,436 --> 00:15:49,636
That's the power of New Amsterdam.

394
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,238
Yes, well, we need a C-ART device.

395
00:15:51,272 --> 00:15:53,273
Okay, I'll call ACC. Done.

396
00:15:53,307 --> 00:15:54,875
Do you know what a C-ART device is?

397
00:15:54,909 --> 00:15:56,443
Will it help your patient?

398
00:15:56,477 --> 00:15:57,744
It's the only thing that will help.

399
00:15:57,778 --> 00:15:58,812
- Good enough for me.
- Thank you.

400
00:15:58,846 --> 00:16:00,747
- Yeah?
- Hey, hey, hey.

401
00:16:00,781 --> 00:16:02,382
I thought you were gonna handle
that whole Dr. M situation?

402
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,951
Yeah, handled. Medical
eval scheduled for tomorrow.

403
00:16:04,986 --> 00:16:06,653
Well, he moved his temporal bone surgery

404
00:16:06,687 --> 00:16:07,921
up to today.

405
00:16:13,194 --> 00:16:15,762
Help! Help! He needs help!

406
00:16:15,796 --> 00:16:18,231
What's happening to him?

407
00:16:18,266 --> 00:16:20,046
Push two milligrams of Ativan.

408
00:16:20,668 --> 00:16:21,968
Biopsy results?

409
00:16:22,003 --> 00:16:24,604
They just came back. It's not cancer.

410
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:25,830
Must be an infection.

411
00:16:25,865 --> 00:16:27,674
Given the ulcers, it's got to be viral.

412
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,175
I'll start Acyclovir.

413
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:31,945
I saw polys on the biopsy.
Bacteria's much more likely.

414
00:16:31,979 --> 00:16:33,813
Or the polys are due
to a secondary infection

415
00:16:33,848 --> 00:16:35,949
on top of the viral infection
and irrelevant.

416
00:16:35,983 --> 00:16:37,751
It's my ED, my call.

417
00:16:37,785 --> 00:16:39,246
And if I disagree with your call?

418
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,255
Bloom, we got four more!
Similar symptoms to Mr. Arroyo!

419
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:43,990
Visible ulcers in the back of the mouth.

420
00:16:44,025 --> 00:16:45,408
Four more?

421
00:16:45,442 --> 00:16:47,427
- Where did they come from?
- Watch out.

422
00:16:47,461 --> 00:16:50,297
We all work together.
They were all sick, too!

423
00:17:00,616 --> 00:17:02,636
Mind if I scrub in?

424
00:17:04,393 --> 00:17:06,027
What are you trying to prove?

425
00:17:06,061 --> 00:17:07,929
Nothing, just here to observe.

426
00:17:07,963 --> 00:17:10,898
I've done this surgery
hundreds of times, Dr. Goodwin.

427
00:17:10,933 --> 00:17:13,034
I don't need the hospital's
Medical Director

428
00:17:13,068 --> 00:17:16,550
standing over my shoulder
evaluating my every incision.

429
00:17:16,551 --> 00:17:18,251
Then pretend I'm not here.

430
00:17:18,286 --> 00:17:20,353
You trying to throw me
off my game, is that it?

431
00:17:20,388 --> 00:17:21,855
I expect all the surgeons in my hospital

432
00:17:21,889 --> 00:17:23,723
to perform at their best

433
00:17:23,758 --> 00:17:25,859
whether I'm here watching or not.

434
00:17:25,893 --> 00:17:28,829
Anyone's not performing
at their best, it's you.

435
00:17:30,231 --> 00:17:32,499
Running a hospital
while undergoing chemo?

436
00:17:32,533 --> 00:17:34,367
You have no right to judge me.

437
00:17:34,402 --> 00:17:35,869
This isn't about me.

438
00:17:35,903 --> 00:17:38,672
I've helped thousands
of patients at this hospital.

439
00:17:38,706 --> 00:17:40,440
Thousands.

440
00:17:40,474 --> 00:17:42,375
My record is sterling.

441
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,511
My reputation impeccable.

442
00:17:44,545 --> 00:17:46,012
Henry, you're a legacy here.

443
00:17:46,047 --> 00:17:47,714
Damn right I am.

444
00:17:47,748 --> 00:17:50,283
But what story do you want
told in the end?

445
00:17:50,318 --> 00:17:52,886
That you were a titan in your field,

446
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,721
or that you were a doctor who didn't know

447
00:17:54,755 --> 00:17:57,018
when to lay down the scalpel?

448
00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:00,312
There'll come a day, Max...

449
00:18:00,828 --> 00:18:02,229
when you won't be able

450
00:18:02,263 --> 00:18:04,358
to perform as well as you once could.

451
00:18:05,766 --> 00:18:07,901
Maybe sooner than you think.

452
00:18:17,945 --> 00:18:20,247
Well, they all work together

453
00:18:20,281 --> 00:18:22,282
out at some vineyard out in Long Island.

454
00:18:22,316 --> 00:18:23,817
And they're all exhibiting
the same symptoms?

455
00:18:23,851 --> 00:18:25,652
To a T.

456
00:18:25,686 --> 00:18:27,888
What at a vineyard could have
made them all so sick?

457
00:18:27,922 --> 00:18:29,756
Let's find out.

458
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:32,726
The owners made us sleep
in this old, rundown barn.

459
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,928
All crowded together, cramped.

460
00:18:34,962 --> 00:18:36,596
How many of you?

461
00:18:36,631 --> 00:18:38,999
17, sometimes 18.

462
00:18:39,033 --> 00:18:41,735
At night, I just tried to think
of my family back home.

463
00:18:41,769 --> 00:18:43,570
Las ratas.

464
00:18:43,604 --> 00:18:45,005
Yes, there were so many rats.

465
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,774
I've been picking
since Hurricane Georges.

466
00:18:47,808 --> 00:18:50,977
Been 20 years since I've seen
Puerto Rico.

467
00:18:51,012 --> 00:18:53,680
Have you harvested
at this vineyard before?

468
00:18:53,714 --> 00:18:54,981
No.

469
00:18:55,016 --> 00:18:57,350
And I will not go back.

470
00:18:57,385 --> 00:18:59,786
I will starve first.

471
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,855
The owner treat us like animals.

472
00:19:01,889 --> 00:19:03,790
Pay us nothing.

473
00:19:03,824 --> 00:19:06,962
And everything was damp
and wet all the time...

474
00:19:07,495 --> 00:19:09,011
mold everywhere.

475
00:19:21,008 --> 00:19:23,643
I'm thinking pesticides led
to an autoimmune reaction...

476
00:19:23,678 --> 00:19:25,011
erythema multiforme.

477
00:19:25,046 --> 00:19:26,780
EM would explain everything.

478
00:19:26,814 --> 00:19:28,859
Their kidney function's fine.

479
00:19:29,483 --> 00:19:31,351
The rats and the close quarters

480
00:19:31,385 --> 00:19:34,554
are the perfect breeding ground
for the hantavirus.

481
00:19:34,588 --> 00:19:36,022
Something's off.

482
00:19:36,057 --> 00:19:37,891
- We're missing something.
- Really?

483
00:19:37,925 --> 00:19:39,726
I think Sharpe
may have nailed it... hanta.

484
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,897
- No, it's not hantavirus.
- Okay. Because?

485
00:19:43,931 --> 00:19:45,543
Because...

486
00:19:46,067 --> 00:19:48,045
I have a gut feeling.

487
00:19:48,602 --> 00:19:50,092
Or you're just disagreeing with me

488
00:19:50,127 --> 00:19:51,966
because it's my diagnosis.

489
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,707
Everything okay here?

490
00:19:53,741 --> 00:19:55,475
- Yes.
- It's fine.

491
00:19:55,509 --> 00:19:57,477
Okay, at the risk
of stepping into something,

492
00:19:57,511 --> 00:19:58,845
I'm gonna make the call.

493
00:19:58,879 --> 00:20:00,529
Treat for hantavirus.

494
00:20:08,089 --> 00:20:10,090
- Suction.
- Suction.

495
00:20:23,938 --> 00:20:26,606
I dropped a bottle, Iggy.

496
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,541
One stupid bottle.

497
00:20:29,944 --> 00:20:31,755
I was, um...

498
00:20:32,413 --> 00:20:34,341
I was worried.

499
00:20:35,082 --> 00:20:37,417
You moved the surgery up

500
00:20:37,451 --> 00:20:38,685
because you knew you wouldn't pass

501
00:20:38,719 --> 00:20:39,786
the medical evaluation.

502
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,888
I moved up my surgery

503
00:20:41,922 --> 00:20:44,124
to prove the evaluation wasn't necessary.

504
00:20:44,158 --> 00:20:45,418
No, Henry, come on...

505
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:48,461
I may not be a young man anymore, Iggy...

506
00:20:48,496 --> 00:20:52,565
but I am a surgeon with over
40 years experience.

507
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,820
And that counts for something.

508
00:20:55,736 --> 00:20:57,971
At least it should count for something.

509
00:21:04,111 --> 00:21:05,297
You really buried the lede

510
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:06,880
on the whole C-ART device, didn't you?

511
00:21:06,914 --> 00:21:07,881
Three...

512
00:21:07,915 --> 00:21:09,582
$3 million.

513
00:21:09,617 --> 00:21:12,118
To be fair, you did say,
"No matter the price."

514
00:21:12,153 --> 00:21:13,753
No, you're right.
I really should have asked

515
00:21:13,788 --> 00:21:14,988
more prudent follow-up questions.

516
00:21:15,022 --> 00:21:16,923
Like, "Does it cost $3 million?"

517
00:21:16,957 --> 00:21:18,102
To be clear,

518
00:21:18,136 --> 00:21:20,894
New Amsterdam will never get
a C-ART device.

519
00:21:20,928 --> 00:21:22,762
See, what'd I tell you?

520
00:21:22,797 --> 00:21:24,631
The system can't handle the small things.

521
00:21:24,665 --> 00:21:25,932
Why in the hell should we be surprised

522
00:21:25,966 --> 00:21:27,600
when it can't handle the big ones?

523
00:21:27,635 --> 00:21:29,102
Didn't let me finish.

524
00:21:29,136 --> 00:21:30,503
New Amsterdam will never get
a C-ART device,

525
00:21:30,538 --> 00:21:31,805
so you should do the surgery

526
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:34,234
at a hospital that does have one.

527
00:21:34,809 --> 00:21:36,576
What are you saying?

528
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:39,813
University has a C-ART device.

529
00:21:39,847 --> 00:21:41,981
We have a patient.

530
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,984
Peanut butter, jelly.

531
00:21:46,153 --> 00:21:47,654
So, as our sister hospital,

532
00:21:47,688 --> 00:21:49,122
they'll let us do the surgery there?

533
00:21:49,156 --> 00:21:52,258
Not exactly...
and definitely not for free.

534
00:21:52,293 --> 00:21:54,794
But her insurance won't cover University.

535
00:21:54,829 --> 00:21:56,196
Yeah, and then I can't do the surgery.

536
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,831
No, you can't.

537
00:21:57,865 --> 00:22:00,260
But Dr. Merritt can.

538
00:22:00,634 --> 00:22:03,002
Last I checked, he's still
credentialed at Uni.

539
00:22:06,841 --> 00:22:08,641
Okay, wait, wait.

540
00:22:08,676 --> 00:22:11,511
Impersonating another doctor
is grounds for malpractice.

541
00:22:11,545 --> 00:22:13,880
I can lose my license.
I can go to prison.

542
00:22:13,914 --> 00:22:16,683
Nobody's suggesting
impersonating anyone, all right?

543
00:22:16,717 --> 00:22:18,618
You are the Chair
of Cardiothoracic Surgery

544
00:22:18,652 --> 00:22:19,786
at New Amsterdam.

545
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,788
- Just say that.
- This is crazy.

546
00:22:21,822 --> 00:22:23,823
- Even for you.
- You want to help the patient?

547
00:22:23,858 --> 00:22:25,859
This is how.

548
00:22:27,661 --> 00:22:30,663
Are you really talking about this?

549
00:22:30,698 --> 00:22:32,532
Sneaking a patient across the city

550
00:22:32,566 --> 00:22:34,801
into University Hospital?

551
00:22:34,835 --> 00:22:37,923
If the system can't handle
the little things...

552
00:22:38,772 --> 00:22:41,074
then it certainly won't notice
the big ones.

553
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,181
Sure.

554
00:22:56,223 --> 00:22:57,891
University Hospital.

555
00:23:19,146 --> 00:23:21,181
Can I help you?

556
00:23:21,215 --> 00:23:22,749
Dr. Nottingham.

557
00:23:22,783 --> 00:23:24,884
I'm here to observe a C-ART procedure

558
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:26,085
as part of my residency.

559
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,555
- I called earlier.
- Observe who?

560
00:23:28,589 --> 00:23:31,124
The Chair of Cardiothoracic
Surgery at New Amsterdam.

561
00:23:31,158 --> 00:23:32,725
It's nice to meet you.

562
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,360
Dr. Merritt?

563
00:23:34,395 --> 00:23:36,229
That's what it says on my door.

564
00:23:42,452 --> 00:23:45,547
Pushing the delivery system
up to the aortic valve.

565
00:23:45,581 --> 00:23:47,208
- You're nearly there.
- How much longer?

566
00:23:47,242 --> 00:23:48,581
Ah, ah, ah.

567
00:23:48,615 --> 00:23:50,272
Don't rush me, and I won't rush you.

568
00:23:50,307 --> 00:23:52,160
If we get caught,
it's my name on the schedule.

569
00:23:52,194 --> 00:23:54,012
Well, Dr. Merritt will cover for you.

570
00:23:54,046 --> 00:23:55,834
I didn't see anything.

571
00:23:56,433 --> 00:23:58,128
Thank you, Maren.

572
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,191
- Sheath's in place.
- Got it.

573
00:24:02,473 --> 00:24:03,950
Inflating the balloon.

574
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,844
Leaflets are moving.

575
00:24:06,587 --> 00:24:09,098
Maren, you'll feel some pressure.

576
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:12,184
Nice and easy.

577
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,353
Almost got it.

578
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,631
All right, new aortic valve's in place.

579
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,700
- Deflating the balloon.
- Wonderful.

580
00:24:20,734 --> 00:24:21,935
Let's get her back to our hospital now.

581
00:24:21,969 --> 00:24:23,570
- Dr. Reynolds.
- I see it.

582
00:24:23,604 --> 00:24:24,871
What?

583
00:24:24,905 --> 00:24:26,573
A bleed at the cath insertion site.

584
00:24:26,607 --> 00:24:27,941
It's a common side effect,

585
00:24:27,975 --> 00:24:30,043
but Maren's gonna have to remain flat

586
00:24:30,077 --> 00:24:31,978
with a sandbag on her hip
to keep the pressure on.

587
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,780
For how long?

588
00:24:33,814 --> 00:24:36,583
It looks like you're gonna have
to do your procedure here as well.

589
00:24:37,084 --> 00:24:38,919
But I'm not Dr. Merritt...

590
00:24:39,653 --> 00:24:40,954
either.

591
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:51,898
Got them all on a cocktail of antivirals,

592
00:24:51,932 --> 00:24:53,800
and we're doing active fluid replacement.

593
00:24:53,834 --> 00:24:54,968
Thanks.

594
00:24:55,002 --> 00:24:57,136
You don't think it's hanta?

595
00:24:57,171 --> 00:24:58,605
No.

596
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,813
What do I know?

597
00:25:08,782 --> 00:25:10,250
You know, Henry was shattered...

598
00:25:10,284 --> 00:25:12,819
just standing there watching the surgery

599
00:25:12,853 --> 00:25:14,020
go on without him.

600
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,154
It's like looking at a broken man.

601
00:25:15,189 --> 00:25:17,156
You did the right thing.

602
00:25:17,191 --> 00:25:18,791
- Did I?
- Yeah.

603
00:25:18,826 --> 00:25:20,526
Then why do I find myself
trying to recall

604
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:22,128
Judas's good traits?

605
00:25:22,162 --> 00:25:23,763
Iggy, I know he's a good friend,

606
00:25:23,797 --> 00:25:25,251
but so are you, okay?

607
00:25:25,285 --> 00:25:27,166
You didn't betray him
because somebody could have

608
00:25:27,201 --> 00:25:28,868
gotten hurt or worse.

609
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,670
Well, his body is going.

610
00:25:30,704 --> 00:25:31,945
His mind is not.

611
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,773
Very few doctors have
that kind of expertise.

612
00:25:33,807 --> 00:25:35,708
I mean, if... if we send him on his way,

613
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:37,677
all that knowledge, all that expertise

614
00:25:37,711 --> 00:25:39,157
goes out the door with him.

615
00:25:39,191 --> 00:25:40,781
You know, we might as well be
saying, "Hey, Doc, thank you.

616
00:25:40,816 --> 00:25:42,009
You're ancient. Don't need you anymore."

617
00:25:42,043 --> 00:25:44,588
Don't let the door hit you on the
wrinkly old ass on the way out."

618
00:25:44,623 --> 00:25:46,778
Hi.

619
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,823
Oh.

620
00:25:50,858 --> 00:25:52,495
Hello.

621
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:54,227
- How are you?
- Hello.

622
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,995
Good-bye, Iggy.

623
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,864
- Huh?
- Leave.

624
00:25:57,898 --> 00:25:59,866
Yes, I'm sorry.

625
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,867
Bye.

626
00:26:00,901 --> 00:26:02,201
Um, I'll be back in ten.

627
00:26:02,236 --> 00:26:03,870
I just need to fire a few people.

628
00:26:05,019 --> 00:26:07,907
You know you can't, uh, fire me, right?

629
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,218
I was referring to Iggy.

630
00:26:09,253 --> 00:26:10,643
Yeah, you can't fire him either.

631
00:26:10,678 --> 00:26:11,744
Yes, I know, Max.

632
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:13,179
But it makes me look in charge,

633
00:26:13,213 --> 00:26:14,881
and right now I could use
a little bit of that.

634
00:26:14,915 --> 00:26:16,850
How are things with you and Bloom?

635
00:26:17,918 --> 00:26:19,228
Fine.

636
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,921
Um, h-how are you feeling?

637
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,331
Good, yeah.

638
00:26:23,365 --> 00:26:25,058
Aside from Iggy starting
an international rumor

639
00:26:25,092 --> 00:26:26,726
that we traffic in ageism, pretty...

640
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,778
Good.

641
00:26:28,696 --> 00:26:31,331
- Your nausea?
- Chemo tried to slow this man down,

642
00:26:31,365 --> 00:26:33,336
- but you know what?
- It failed?

643
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:35,268
No, it succeeded, big-time.

644
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:39,339
But, uh, the drugs you gave me
are helping.

645
00:26:39,373 --> 00:26:40,582
Good.

646
00:26:41,075 --> 00:26:42,742
Well, it sounds like you're
in the right frame of mind

647
00:26:42,776 --> 00:26:44,377
to start radiation.

648
00:26:44,411 --> 00:26:46,588
Aren't you glad you swung by?

649
00:26:51,051 --> 00:26:52,469
So glad.

650
00:26:53,053 --> 00:26:55,688
Okay.

651
00:26:55,723 --> 00:26:58,257
Everyone just act normal,
like you belong here.

652
00:26:58,292 --> 00:27:00,059
Like we're doctors in a hospital?

653
00:27:00,094 --> 00:27:01,761
MRI lab is down this way.

654
00:27:01,795 --> 00:27:03,763
How are we gonna get in?

655
00:27:03,797 --> 00:27:06,366
You might have to schedule us again.

656
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,701
I'm starting to miss
the real Dr. Merritt.

657
00:27:08,736 --> 00:27:11,371
- How are you doing, Maren?
- Nervous.

658
00:27:11,405 --> 00:27:15,675
I haven't let myself be hopeful
in a very, very long time.

659
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:19,112
I know this whole process
has been rather unorthodox,

660
00:27:19,146 --> 00:27:21,981
but I made you a promise,
and promise I will keep.

661
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:24,884
Dr. Kapoor, what are you doing here?

662
00:27:27,121 --> 00:27:28,955
Funny story, actually.

663
00:27:28,989 --> 00:27:31,290
Dr. Carlebach was one of my best interns

664
00:27:31,325 --> 00:27:32,552
back in the day.

665
00:27:32,586 --> 00:27:34,727
And now he's this big-time neurologist

666
00:27:34,762 --> 00:27:36,381
here in University.

667
00:27:36,416 --> 00:27:38,831
Yeah, Dr. Kapoor tried
to recruit me to New Amsterdam.

668
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:40,666
I wanted to go... I really did, Vijay...

669
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:42,835
but my med school loans
were out of control.

670
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,737
I had to go private.

671
00:27:44,772 --> 00:27:46,439
- It's nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

672
00:27:46,473 --> 00:27:47,974
But I got to admit,

673
00:27:48,008 --> 00:27:49,809
I still miss my days at The Dam.

674
00:27:49,843 --> 00:27:52,311
Making the most out of nothing,
thinking outside the box.

675
00:27:52,346 --> 00:27:55,982
Always such an adventure.

676
00:28:00,187 --> 00:28:02,822
Funny you should say that, Dr. Carlebach.

677
00:28:11,498 --> 00:28:13,933
Initiating sonication pulse.

678
00:28:13,967 --> 00:28:16,553
And going again.

679
00:28:17,371 --> 00:28:18,971
Mrs. Thompson, we're using

680
00:28:19,006 --> 00:28:20,483
high-intensity focused ultrasound

681
00:28:20,517 --> 00:28:22,141
to pinpoint the tumor
at the base of your brain.

682
00:28:22,176 --> 00:28:23,602
Oh, okay.

683
00:28:24,878 --> 00:28:26,846
Maren, how are you feeling?

684
00:28:28,215 --> 00:28:30,358
Honestly, I don't know.

685
00:28:30,984 --> 00:28:32,452
I thought I was doing this

686
00:28:32,486 --> 00:28:35,388
so that I could see
my daughter's face, but...

687
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,991
I don't think I am.

688
00:28:38,892 --> 00:28:40,827
I think...

689
00:28:40,861 --> 00:28:43,196
I wanted her to see mine.

690
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:46,399
I want... I want her
to see me seeing her,

691
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,726
being...

692
00:28:49,503 --> 00:28:52,205
Proud and growing up and falling down,

693
00:28:52,239 --> 00:28:53,924
being scared.

694
00:28:55,209 --> 00:28:57,219
I want her to know...

695
00:28:57,845 --> 00:28:59,346
all her life...

696
00:29:00,214 --> 00:29:01,973
that she's seen.

697
00:29:10,921 --> 00:29:13,159
The tumor is responding.

698
00:29:32,913 --> 00:29:34,447
Hey.

699
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,758
Is, uh, this seat taken?

700
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,149
You know, we're, uh, doing
everything we can for Miguel...

701
00:29:43,174 --> 00:29:44,307
and the others.

702
00:29:44,766 --> 00:29:46,032
Thank you.

703
00:29:48,795 --> 00:29:50,272
What's that?

704
00:29:51,465 --> 00:29:52,899
A santo.

705
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:58,437
After Maria, our house
was just mud and water

706
00:29:58,472 --> 00:30:01,541
and the trunk of a huge tree
where my bedroom once stood.

707
00:30:01,575 --> 00:30:04,377
I went to a santero in town
and asked him to carve this

708
00:30:04,411 --> 00:30:05,945
from the wood of that tree.

709
00:30:05,979 --> 00:30:07,872
- As a reminder?
- No, no.

710
00:30:07,907 --> 00:30:09,875
There are many a santo on the island.

711
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:12,932
This one is Anima Sola...

712
00:30:13,153 --> 00:30:15,121
the Lonely Soul.

713
00:30:15,155 --> 00:30:18,925
She is in Purgatory,
bound to the flames forever.

714
00:30:18,959 --> 00:30:22,428
And I pray to her
for strength and patience...

715
00:30:22,462 --> 00:30:24,014
and redemption.

716
00:30:24,631 --> 00:30:26,599
Why redemption?

717
00:30:26,633 --> 00:30:27,976
I, um...

718
00:30:29,636 --> 00:30:31,571
I liked to drink...

719
00:30:31,605 --> 00:30:33,072
too much.

720
00:30:33,106 --> 00:30:35,141
And I could not stop.

721
00:30:35,175 --> 00:30:37,443
And I would be dead if not for her.

722
00:30:37,477 --> 00:30:40,313
She helps me to say no.

723
00:30:40,347 --> 00:30:42,281
She reminds me to always think
of tomorrow.

724
00:30:42,316 --> 00:30:44,083
She keeps me alive.

725
00:30:44,117 --> 00:30:45,918
And yet you work on a vineyard...

726
00:30:47,287 --> 00:30:49,288
Surrounded by temptation every day.

727
00:30:49,323 --> 00:30:51,123
Miguel helps me with that.

728
00:30:51,158 --> 00:30:53,159
Never lets the others tempt me
with the angel's share.

729
00:30:53,193 --> 00:30:54,594
"Angel's share"?

730
00:30:54,628 --> 00:30:57,129
In the barrels, the top layer of wine?

731
00:30:57,164 --> 00:30:58,464
It evaporates.

732
00:30:58,498 --> 00:31:00,467
They call that the angel's share.

733
00:31:01,368 --> 00:31:03,002
I like that.

734
00:31:03,036 --> 00:31:04,937
So do all my friends, believe me,

735
00:31:04,972 --> 00:31:07,006
and all the other workers.

736
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,374
At the end of a shift,

737
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,943
they would dip into the crush and drink.

738
00:31:10,978 --> 00:31:12,845
After the way they treated us,

739
00:31:12,879 --> 00:31:14,880
they felt like they deserved
a little taste.

740
00:31:17,217 --> 00:31:19,452
Well, I'm sure the angels would agree.

741
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,527
Blood pressure 60 over palp.

742
00:31:28,562 --> 00:31:30,529
- Then he's fading fast.
- Add Dobutamine.

743
00:31:30,564 --> 00:31:32,064
Ten micrograms per minute.

744
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:33,633
It's odd that his heart rate is 78.

745
00:31:33,667 --> 00:31:36,202
It should be 178.
The antivirals aren't working.

746
00:31:36,236 --> 00:31:37,503
Mariana!

747
00:31:37,537 --> 00:31:39,005
Mariana, hang a bag of streptomycin!

748
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,373
Wait, no, no, no, no, no!

749
00:31:40,407 --> 00:31:41,507
The hantavirus is affecting his heart!

750
00:31:41,541 --> 00:31:43,009
He needs a pacing wire.

751
00:31:43,043 --> 00:31:44,210
He needs streptomycin, okay?

752
00:31:44,244 --> 00:31:45,878
I-I don't have time to explain.

753
00:31:45,912 --> 00:31:48,180
Do you trust me or not?

754
00:31:50,417 --> 00:31:52,397
I am setting up a pacing wire.

755
00:32:01,194 --> 00:32:03,780
Lauren, you open this door!

756
00:32:04,431 --> 00:32:05,598
Lauren!

757
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,326
What are you doing? Don't do this!

758
00:32:09,102 --> 00:32:11,404
Call Dr. Goodwin.

759
00:32:28,624 --> 00:32:30,325
Ready?

760
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:31,693
Come here.

761
00:32:31,727 --> 00:32:33,995
Here we go.

762
00:32:37,366 --> 00:32:40,168
Mommy, will you be able to see me?

763
00:32:40,202 --> 00:32:42,707
- Oh, I hope so, honey.
- Almost there.

764
00:32:56,352 --> 00:32:58,520
What do you see, Mrs. Thompson?

765
00:33:01,273 --> 00:33:03,158
Mommy?

766
00:33:11,834 --> 00:33:14,654
It's okay, baby.

767
00:33:16,205 --> 00:33:19,207
Because in my head
and my heart, I see you...

768
00:33:19,647 --> 00:33:21,575
so clearly, okay?

769
00:33:21,609 --> 00:33:24,546
I see you perfectly.

770
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,541
I don't understand.

771
00:33:26,542 --> 00:33:28,516
I thought you said it was gonna work?

772
00:33:31,868 --> 00:33:34,022
The tumors were destroyed.

773
00:33:34,848 --> 00:33:36,691
Surgery should have worked.

774
00:33:39,758 --> 00:33:41,529
There must be something we missed.

775
00:33:54,919 --> 00:33:56,544
Miguel Arroyo is stable.

776
00:33:56,579 --> 00:33:58,413
Let's, um... let's treat the others

777
00:33:58,447 --> 00:34:01,049
for oropharyngeal tularemia.

778
00:34:01,648 --> 00:34:03,351
They got it from drinking
partially fermented wine

779
00:34:03,385 --> 00:34:05,386
right out of the barrels.

780
00:34:08,162 --> 00:34:10,225
That's why Ivan never showed
signs of illness.

781
00:34:10,698 --> 00:34:12,427
He's sober.

782
00:34:14,563 --> 00:34:18,192
You know, you and I
working together like this...

783
00:34:19,753 --> 00:34:21,269
It's not gonna work.

784
00:34:22,116 --> 00:34:23,271
You're right.

785
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,702
Oh, hey, how was your
radiation treatment?

786
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,670
Mm, like a relaxing vacation...

787
00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:34,671
at Chernobyl.

788
00:34:35,265 --> 00:34:36,773
Right.

789
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:38,608
Henry, hi.

790
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:40,110
Um...

791
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:42,179
if this is about the exit paperwork,

792
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:43,680
I was about to get to it.

793
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:45,782
Yeah, good. Great, okay.

794
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:47,443
Don't get to it.

795
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,087
Excuse me?

796
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:52,255
Because you're not exiting.

797
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,893
Can I tell him because of your
whole throat thing?

798
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,028
Could I stop you if I wanted to?

799
00:34:58,062 --> 00:34:59,062
No.

800
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,698
Okay, I am, uh...

801
00:35:01,733 --> 00:35:04,267
very happy to tell you
that we here at New Amsterdam

802
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:06,737
would officially like to offer you

803
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,591
the brand-new position
of Chair of Telemedicine.

804
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,376
- "Telemedicine"?
- Video conferencing.

805
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,745
We can reach our sister hospitals

806
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,313
in Latin American, disaster sites,

807
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:18,115
war zones, all around the world.

808
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:20,083
Yeah, all in need
of experienced doctors like you

809
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:23,053
to help guide and consult them
through complicated surgeries.

810
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:25,607
Surgeries that you've done
hundreds of times.

811
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,892
I, uh...

812
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:32,929
Thank you.

813
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:36,233
It's your experience
that's irreplaceable...

814
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:37,592
not your hands.

815
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:47,110
I just don't see anything.

816
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,613
May I touch your face
to perform an examination?

817
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,114
Yeah, that's fine.

818
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,301
- Please close your eyes.
- Mm.

819
00:35:57,722 --> 00:36:00,123
I would like to try latanoprost.

820
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,643
That's...

821
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:06,830
Uh, what's wrong?

822
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:09,366
Your eyes are harder than they should be.

823
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,302
This indicates glaucoma
might have developed.

824
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:15,439
But there is no way you would
have ever known about it.

825
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:17,617
There's always a catch, right?

826
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,040
Please lean your head back for me.

827
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:26,626
Yeah.

828
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:31,673
Blink.

829
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:25,442
Oh, that's a beautiful drawing, baby.

830
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:33,717
Yeah.

831
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,653
Oh.

832
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,355
Can you see us?

833
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:41,124
Yes, my love, I can see you.

834
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:43,527
- Can you see me?
- I can see you.

835
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:46,129
You can?

836
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,402
I can see.

837
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:57,908
It turns out being Dr. Merritt

838
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:00,076
does have its advantages.

839
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:06,416
Come here. Oh...

840
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,488
I see you.

841
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,258
Retractor.

842
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:27,304
Hey.

843
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:30,073
Oh, looks like someone's feeling better.

844
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:34,277
No, don't thank me.

845
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:37,113
Thank your brother and his santo.

846
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,281
She told me the answer.

847
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:41,518
- El Anima Sola?
- Yes.

848
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:44,254
You two are really lucky
to have each other.

849
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:46,122
I, uh...

850
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,858
don't really get along
with my real sister.

851
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:50,994
But what you two have...

852
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:53,129
you're gonna rebuild.

853
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:56,234
I know it.

854
00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:58,602
Here.

855
00:38:58,636 --> 00:39:00,270
Please, for you.

856
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:01,838
- No, I-I can't...
- Yes, yes, yes.

857
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:03,273
I insist.

858
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:04,975
My brother, he will take care of me,

859
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:08,278
and Anima Sola,
she will take care of you.

860
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:15,367
Thank you.

861
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:34,885
Max?

862
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:38,690
What's wrong?

863
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,950
I've, um...

864
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,852
I've been round and round in my head,

865
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,855
but I can't see
that there's any other way.

866
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,189
Helen?

867
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:58,034
This is harder than I thought.

868
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:05,201
I think that I need to report
an impaired physician.

869
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,611
No, we already took care of it.

870
00:40:06,645 --> 00:40:08,038
- There's no...
- Max...

871
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:10,040
I'm talking about Bloom.

872
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,549
Babe, is that you?

873
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,518
Yep.

874
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:30,060
- Hey.
- Hi.

875
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,562
How is the guy who's not about

876
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:34,064
to let cancer slow him down?

877
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:38,748
Profoundly humbled.

878
00:40:43,507 --> 00:40:45,384
I made dinner.

879
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:48,378
Steak, baked potato, and broccoli.

880
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:50,380
Wow.

881
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,263
Chemo?

882
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,132
Radiation.

883
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:12,602
- My throat, it's already...
- Oh, babe.

884
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:15,305
Helen said that I wouldn't even feel it

885
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:16,439
for four to five days.

886
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,441
Well, you really are special.

887
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,795
So special.

888
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:24,080
It smells...

889
00:41:24,115 --> 00:41:26,592
it smells amazing.

890
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:30,221
- Sorry.
- Hey...

891
00:41:31,764 --> 00:41:33,690
you have nothing to be sorry about.

892
00:41:33,724 --> 00:41:36,126
Maybe you should put me
in the return pile.

893
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,595
Nope.

894
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:41,731
You are a keeper.

895
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,294
Stay there.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
