1
00:00:07,023 --> 00:00:10,015
<i>- Previously on</i> ER...
- Can I get a couple of condoms?

2
00:00:10,193 --> 00:00:11,524
- How old are you?
- 18.

3
00:00:11,695 --> 00:00:15,028
The hospital is floating me
to Neuro three times a week.

4
00:00:15,198 --> 00:00:16,995
It's a miracle.

5
00:00:18,702 --> 00:00:20,431
Abby.

6
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:23,771
Do us all a favor. Ask her out.

7
00:00:23,973 --> 00:00:27,807
- You wanna go out tonight?
- I can't. I've got plans.

8
00:00:27,977 --> 00:00:30,468
I waited too long.
Missed my chance. Blew it.

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,977
I'm leaving my Residency.

10
00:00:32,148 --> 00:00:34,082
- Quitting?
- Transferring.

11
00:00:35,151 --> 00:00:36,880
- Where?
- Phoenix.

12
00:00:43,727 --> 00:00:48,130
If you don't have your child's card
with you, let me know.

13
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:51,597
Chuny, can I get a hand
in here, please?

14
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,769
Okay, I'll be with you in a second.
Did everybody get a cookie?

15
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:58,304
Excuse me, pal.

16
00:00:58,508 --> 00:01:01,807
I need you to explain to her
about the lead.

17
00:01:06,716 --> 00:01:07,876
That ain't Spanish.

18
00:01:08,051 --> 00:01:13,284
We need to take some blood to see
if the baby's been exposed to lead.

19
00:01:13,456 --> 00:01:15,890
- Lead is very bad for children.
- Okay.

20
00:01:16,059 --> 00:01:19,358
- Lf there's a problem, we'll call you.
- Okay.

21
00:01:19,529 --> 00:01:22,498
You sign this, and the nurse
will take some blood.

22
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:25,065
- Okay.
- Next, please!

23
00:01:25,201 --> 00:01:28,932
- I think that was informed consent.
- Close enough.

24
00:01:29,105 --> 00:01:31,767
- Hey, old man.
- You again?

25
00:01:33,276 --> 00:01:36,507
Yeah, I know... Halloween.
Charlie, right?

26
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:40,581
You gave me some condoms.
You were a couple of years late.

27
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,082
- You're telling me that's yours?
- Why not?

28
00:01:43,253 --> 00:01:47,314
- His dad's a Pakistani dude.
- And his name is Lopez because...

29
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,584
Okay. His mom, Gloria,
is a friend of mine.

30
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,228
She got a job today,
so I'm babysitting.

31
00:01:53,396 --> 00:01:55,387
She heard they were
giving out free shots.

32
00:01:55,565 --> 00:01:58,329
Ahmed hasn't been seen
since he was 4 months old?

33
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:00,493
- I guess.
- Let me see. Let's take a look.

34
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,070
What's he now?
About a year and a half?

35
00:02:03,273 --> 00:02:06,800
We need to have
his mother's address for a follow-up.

36
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,410
- They live at Sisters, over on Grand.
- The shelter?

37
00:02:09,579 --> 00:02:13,606
- Don't we need parental consent?
- That's why I told you. I'm the mom.

38
00:02:13,783 --> 00:02:16,547
All right, Ms. Lopez.
Why don't you sign right there?

39
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,745
- I don't know about this.
- Want me to send him home?

40
00:02:19,923 --> 00:02:21,083
Okay, next!

41
00:02:21,257 --> 00:02:26,217
- Charlie, shouldn't you be in school?
- We're off. It's Career Day.

42
00:02:29,165 --> 00:02:32,601
- BP's 200 over 140.
- Try to relax, Mr. Reynolds, okay?

43
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:35,602
- Ultrasound's ready.
- Take a look. Tell me what you see.

44
00:02:35,772 --> 00:02:41,733
- You wanna start him on beta-blockers?
- Yes. Esmolol, 5 grams and 500 ml.

45
00:02:41,978 --> 00:02:45,141
- And four of morphine.
- It's a triple-A about four cm.

46
00:02:45,315 --> 00:02:48,307
- Dr. Lewis, I was afraid I'd missed you.
- I'm on till 2.

47
00:02:48,484 --> 00:02:51,851
- It won't be the same without you.
- Stop it. It's hard enough.

48
00:02:52,021 --> 00:02:53,716
Give Dr. Carter the bullet.

49
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:57,189
72-year-old male. History of
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia.

50
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,523
One previous MI. Pain began
in left, lower quadrant a week ago.

51
00:03:00,697 --> 00:03:04,292
The ultrasound shows an abdominal
aneurysm, four cm.

52
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:08,029
- We'll take him off your hands.
- Not so fast, Dr. Carter.

53
00:03:08,204 --> 00:03:11,696
- Check his femoral pulses.
- The ultrasound indicates surgery.

54
00:03:11,908 --> 00:03:14,775
- What do you think, Dr. Doyle?
- I'm with Carter. Chance of rupture.

55
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:18,436
- Ten percent. And the femoral pulses?
- Two plus bilaterally.

56
00:03:18,648 --> 00:03:20,582
So good blood flow
to lower extremities.

57
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,378
- Ultrasound indicates a risk.
- Shows no leakage.

58
00:03:23,553 --> 00:03:26,283
- Let's get a CT to confirm.
- You wanna manage it medically.

59
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:29,289
I'd like to try. The machines
can give us test results.

60
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,360
But they like to keep us here
for our diagnostic judgment.

61
00:03:32,528 --> 00:03:35,520
This is her last shift.
Maybe our last patient together.

62
00:03:35,698 --> 00:03:38,428
- She's trying to bust me.
- One has to hold you surgeons back.

63
00:03:38,568 --> 00:03:42,698
- Page me when you need me.
- Okay, let's get him to CT.

64
00:03:42,872 --> 00:03:45,898
- Guess I got a lot to learn.
- Yeah, it takes practice.

65
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:50,011
Don't be afraid to step up. You
should have seen me in my first year.

66
00:03:50,213 --> 00:03:53,614
Don't believe her.
She was always this good.

67
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,262
- Are you with the moving company?
- No, I'm a friend of Susan's.

68
00:04:08,431 --> 00:04:11,889
You're the one who's
interested in taking over the lease?

69
00:04:12,035 --> 00:04:15,471
- Phyllis Dodds. I'm the landlady.
- Hi, Phyllis.

70
00:04:15,638 --> 00:04:17,902
- Are you okay?
- It's just a muscle spasm.

71
00:04:18,107 --> 00:04:19,540
Probably stress.

72
00:04:19,742 --> 00:04:23,439
It's a great one bedroom. Lots
of closet space, nice cross-breeze...

73
00:04:23,613 --> 00:04:26,241
...and a quiet street.
- Yeah, I've spent some time here.

74
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:30,614
- You worked with Susan?
- Three years. Actually, more.

75
00:04:30,787 --> 00:04:33,620
- Are you single?
- Divorced. And I've got...

76
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,883
...my daughter every other Saturday.

77
00:04:36,059 --> 00:04:38,823
No live-ins, no parties, no pets?

78
00:04:38,995 --> 00:04:41,896
- None of the above.
- A landlady's dream.

79
00:04:42,065 --> 00:04:44,226
At least it worked for someone.

80
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:48,963
Oh, good. All the boxes go.
The luggage stays.

81
00:04:49,138 --> 00:04:52,301
Place looks a lot bigger
without Susan's stuff, doesn't it?

82
00:04:52,508 --> 00:04:54,908
A whole lot emptier.

83
00:05:55,838 --> 00:05:59,899
We're screwed. We can pull
all interns off their electives.

84
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:02,600
Unless Senior Residents
lose vacation time...

85
00:06:02,812 --> 00:06:04,803
...we won't be able
to cover the schedule.

86
00:06:05,014 --> 00:06:08,347
- Are you okay?
- I didn't get much sleep last night.

87
00:06:08,518 --> 00:06:12,079
- What did you say after "screwed"?
- It's gonna be a pain to lose Susan.

88
00:06:12,255 --> 00:06:14,246
Big mistake for her. Phoenix.

89
00:06:14,424 --> 00:06:17,086
What was Morgenstern thinking
letting her go?

90
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,421
I wanna be supportive
of lifestyle choices...

91
00:06:19,595 --> 00:06:21,654
...but we're getting
the short end here.

92
00:06:21,831 --> 00:06:24,891
- Good morning, all.
- Hang tough, Coach Pino.

93
00:06:25,034 --> 00:06:27,969
35-year-old roller hockey coach
got slammed into the board.

94
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:31,436
- Possible hip dislocation.
- Dr. Weaver, can I take this one?

95
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:35,202
- Did you guys nail him?
- He told us to play the body.

96
00:06:35,411 --> 00:06:38,847
Never apologize for a good
hip check. Right, coach?

97
00:06:39,048 --> 00:06:41,414
- Sure you're feeling okay?
- Yeah. Stiff muscles.

98
00:06:41,584 --> 00:06:44,951
- Might be coming down with something.
- Go home. Maybe your only chance.

99
00:06:45,121 --> 00:06:48,056
I think I'm gonna stick around.

100
00:06:48,224 --> 00:06:51,557
Hey. So T-minus
five hours and counting?

101
00:06:51,727 --> 00:06:54,719
- I'm getting nervous.
- You'll do great in Arizona.

102
00:06:54,897 --> 00:06:56,831
The winters there are like heaven.

103
00:06:56,966 --> 00:06:58,831
I don't wanna leave anyone
in the lurch.

104
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:02,562
We'll muddle through.
I signed the lease.

105
00:07:02,738 --> 00:07:06,003
Great! It'd be a shame
to let that place go.

106
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:09,201
And I'll never forget your address.

107
00:07:09,412 --> 00:07:10,845
Wanna help me
with a teaching demo?

108
00:07:12,148 --> 00:07:15,777
- You give him five of morphine?
- And Valium and 100 methohexital.

109
00:07:15,952 --> 00:07:19,547
The first nurse, in this case Susan,
applies counter traction.

110
00:07:19,722 --> 00:07:23,624
Good job, Susan.
Then you grab behind the knee.

111
00:07:23,793 --> 00:07:26,660
And you lift. And you lift...

112
00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:29,263
...until you feel that...

113
00:07:29,432 --> 00:07:32,731
...hip slip back into place.

114
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,666
- That's it.
- Okay.

115
00:07:34,837 --> 00:07:36,600
- Thanks, Susan.
- Anytime.

116
00:07:36,806 --> 00:07:39,934
Anytime in the next four hours.

117
00:07:41,144 --> 00:07:43,704
Dislocations aren't tough.
You'll get it.

118
00:07:43,913 --> 00:07:45,437
I know. I've done a bunch of them.

119
00:07:45,648 --> 00:07:48,776
- Why did you ask for help?
- I didn't.

120
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,150
- That was perfect.
- Will you take one for me?

121
00:07:53,322 --> 00:07:55,916
We will do anything
for you, Dr. Keaton.

122
00:07:56,092 --> 00:07:58,720
- Say "discharge."
- Discharge!

123
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,556
- Great.
- There's Dr. Benton.

124
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,790
The Herlihys are taking
Megan home today.

125
00:08:03,933 --> 00:08:05,798
Yeah, I heard. Congratulations.

126
00:08:05,968 --> 00:08:09,233
David, get one with
Dr. Benton in it, please.

127
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:13,364
- It would mean so much.
- Smile.

128
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:16,740
We owe you so much.

129
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:20,212
We're not usually shy about
taking credit. But in this case...

130
00:08:20,383 --> 00:08:23,614
...Megan deserves
all the congratulations.

131
00:08:23,786 --> 00:08:27,085
- We'll be in touch.
- Bye.

132
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,752
- That was awkward.
- Why?

133
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,862
- I almost killed their baby.
- Never begrudge a good outcome.

134
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:37,989
- It's nothing to be proud of.
- But sometimes the gods smile.

135
00:08:38,134 --> 00:08:41,626
- Hi.
- Carter, what are you doing here?

136
00:08:41,804 --> 00:08:45,467
Actually, I was coming to...

137
00:08:45,675 --> 00:08:50,977
- To look at the literature review?
- Yes, I was. I am, if you are.

138
00:08:51,147 --> 00:08:53,843
- The literature review?
- I kidnapped your intern.

139
00:08:54,016 --> 00:08:56,610
I hope you don't mind,
but I'm up against a deadline...

140
00:08:56,786 --> 00:09:00,187
...so I asked Dr. Carter to contribute
to an article I'm writing.

141
00:09:00,356 --> 00:09:02,790
- Yes, you did.
- As long as it doesn't interfere...

142
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,792
...with your other work.
- No, this thing with Dr. Keaton...

143
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,896
This article won't get in the way.

144
00:09:08,064 --> 00:09:10,999
I can go over
your first draft at 3.

145
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:15,160
Okay? Okay, see you 3.

146
00:09:17,106 --> 00:09:20,041
- Clearing out your locker?
- This is too weird.

147
00:09:20,243 --> 00:09:22,370
- What time is your train?
- 4:20.

148
00:09:22,578 --> 00:09:25,376
I have to go by my house
and pick up my stuff.

149
00:09:25,548 --> 00:09:29,848
- I'm not cutting it too close, am I?
- You're on until 2?

150
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:32,783
There's no farewell thing
going on, is there?

151
00:09:32,955 --> 00:09:35,549
- No. Not that I've heard of.
- Okay, good.

152
00:09:35,725 --> 00:09:39,126
- Mark is acting so odd.
- Well, he's gonna miss you.

153
00:09:40,096 --> 00:09:44,863
He thinks I should go. If I have to
hear how great Phoenix is once more...

154
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:49,631
He's just trying to be a good sport,
judging from how miserable he looks.

155
00:09:50,406 --> 00:09:51,998
Having second thoughts?

156
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,506
I never made a decision
that seemed so right.

157
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,373
You know, once I made it,
I just felt great.

158
00:09:58,714 --> 00:10:02,650
- Of course I'm having second thoughts.
- I wish you weren't going.

159
00:10:02,818 --> 00:10:05,719
- But you do look happy.
- Do I?

160
00:10:05,888 --> 00:10:07,788
I'm afraid that I'm not happy at all.

161
00:10:07,957 --> 00:10:09,857
Just barging in
on Chloe and Joe's happiness.

162
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,824
Well, she owes you
a couple of barge-ins.

163
00:10:12,995 --> 00:10:14,724
Susan, there you are.

164
00:10:14,897 --> 00:10:16,831
- What's wrong?
- I need a second opinion.

165
00:10:16,966 --> 00:10:18,729
Sure.

166
00:10:20,569 --> 00:10:21,968
See? Odd.

167
00:10:23,773 --> 00:10:25,900
I wanna get your opinion on a patient.

168
00:10:26,108 --> 00:10:28,201
- Are you coming down with something?
- I hope not.

169
00:10:28,411 --> 00:10:30,606
Exam Room 1,
28-year-old smoker on the pill...

170
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,543
...complains of shortness of breath.

171
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:37,311
Diffuse low voltage on her EKG. I'm
thinking pericarditis. Get an echo.

172
00:10:37,486 --> 00:10:40,046
- That's what I'd do.
- Could it be pulmonary embolism?

173
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:44,488
She's at risk. Abnormal EKG.
It could be lead placement.

174
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,527
- No, I'd go with the echo.
- You sure?

175
00:10:47,697 --> 00:10:50,860
It's a no-brainer. You could always
get a VQ scan if the echo's negative.

176
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,992
That's what I was thinking.
So I'll order an echo.

177
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:58,732
The Mutt and Jeff of emergency
medicine pooling their expertise...

178
00:10:58,941 --> 00:11:02,172
...before she leaves us in the dust.
- Doug, stop.

179
00:11:02,345 --> 00:11:04,540
Randi, call the lab,
pick up these tests.

180
00:11:04,714 --> 00:11:08,206
- Where have you been?
- The Hellmobile.

181
00:11:08,384 --> 00:11:10,852
Diaper rash, Curtain 3.
Saved it just for you.

182
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,955
Anspaugh made you ride
the mobile again so soon?

183
00:11:14,123 --> 00:11:17,650
No. The immunization
program was Dr. Ross' idea.

184
00:11:17,827 --> 00:11:21,456
- Is this true?
- It keeps me off the streets.

185
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:25,225
I got sunscreen.
I got a turquoise belt buckle.

186
00:11:25,368 --> 00:11:28,064
- I got a snake bite kit.
- What for?

187
00:11:28,237 --> 00:11:29,898
Susan's farewell.

188
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:34,600
- And we've got a cactus-shaped cake.
- I don't know. She'll hate this.

189
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:38,337
Of course she'll hate it.
That's why we're doing it.

190
00:11:38,547 --> 00:11:42,745
- You look lousy.
- I've got this neck thing and fever.

191
00:11:42,918 --> 00:11:44,943
- There's a flu around.
- You didn't do it?

192
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:48,113
- You didn't tell her how you feel.
- She's leaving.

193
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,383
She's made her decision.

194
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:54,495
I don't see any point
in saying anything.

195
00:11:56,565 --> 00:11:59,966
In two hours, we'll have a 1 -week-old
male baby on this table.

196
00:12:00,102 --> 00:12:02,070
And what do we know
about this poor soul.

197
00:12:02,238 --> 00:12:06,072
He has a distended abdomen,
visible peristalsis.

198
00:12:06,275 --> 00:12:08,766
The upper-GI series showed...

199
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:13,472
...a partial small bowel obstruction.
- When we open him up we expect...?

200
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:16,015
- A malrotation of the gut.
- Meaning...?

201
00:12:16,185 --> 00:12:20,144
The 10th week of fetal development, the
cephalic limb of the intestinal loop...

202
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:24,383
...elongated and twisted 270 degrees.
- Begin with the duodenum.

203
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,290
What would you expect to see
in a normal 1 -week-old?

204
00:12:27,463 --> 00:12:30,125
What? You mean, like
the duodenum leads to...?

205
00:12:30,266 --> 00:12:33,827
Close your eyes. Try to see it.

206
00:12:36,272 --> 00:12:40,436
The duodenum leads to jejunum,
which connects to the ileum.

207
00:12:40,643 --> 00:12:44,101
Okay, but slow down
and tell me what you see.

208
00:12:44,313 --> 00:12:47,544
- What do you mean?
- Start with the image of...

209
00:12:47,716 --> 00:12:49,775
...a healthy gut.

210
00:12:49,952 --> 00:12:53,183
I'm seeing the head of the pancreas.

211
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:56,381
It's like a tiny fist
holding two straws.

212
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:58,823
You mean the
mesenteric artery and vein.

213
00:12:59,595 --> 00:13:02,860
It's nestled in the open
sea of the duodenum.

214
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:06,866
And its surface is like fine pebbles.

215
00:13:07,002 --> 00:13:10,529
A beautiful shade of tannish yellow.

216
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:13,038
Go on. You try it.

217
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:17,240
Okay, the...

218
00:13:18,647 --> 00:13:22,083
The pancreas is...

219
00:13:22,284 --> 00:13:26,050
...shaped like a tadpole
with a big head.

220
00:13:28,757 --> 00:13:31,157
It narrows into a tail...

221
00:13:31,327 --> 00:13:34,455
...that curls
into the hilum of the spleen.

222
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:37,030
Go on. Now see the spleen.

223
00:13:41,937 --> 00:13:43,427
- Susan.
- Yes.

224
00:13:43,606 --> 00:13:46,803
We had a rocky start, but I thought
we worked on our relationship...

225
00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:48,772
...and developed
a professional rapport.

226
00:13:48,944 --> 00:13:50,536
- What's this about?
- The smoker in 1.

227
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:53,044
I diagnosed her
with a pulmonary embolism...

228
00:13:53,215 --> 00:13:56,207
...and consented her for a VQ.
- I thought it was Mark's patient.

229
00:13:56,385 --> 00:13:59,513
- He asked me for my opinion.
- My beef is with him then.

230
00:13:59,688 --> 00:14:03,124
Let me talk to him.
I think I know what the problem is.

231
00:14:03,292 --> 00:14:05,954
- No. Absolutely not.
- It ticks me off.

232
00:14:06,128 --> 00:14:08,221
- I probably could go up there.
- No, you can't.

233
00:14:08,397 --> 00:14:10,524
It wouldn't kill me to finish off
this one shift up in Neuro.

234
00:14:10,699 --> 00:14:13,497
It's the principle.
Last week Lydia went up there...

235
00:14:13,636 --> 00:14:15,797
...and it encouraged them to do it more.

236
00:14:15,971 --> 00:14:17,962
I got called up to Neuro
to fill in for the day.

237
00:14:18,173 --> 00:14:21,199
May I speak to the nursing
administrator. Hathaway in the ER.

238
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:23,537
When do you max out
on your pension?

239
00:14:23,746 --> 00:14:28,115
- Two more years.
- They are hassling the senior nurses.

240
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,151
Hey! What's in the box? Bridal Shop?

241
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,483
- You and Al finally set the date?
- No. The opposite.

242
00:14:34,657 --> 00:14:36,989
- She broke off with Al.
- I'm returning this ridiculous...

243
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:40,720
...fake virgin outfit, and they'd
better not offer me store credit.

244
00:14:40,896 --> 00:14:44,354
- Sorry, Lydia.
- What did Al do?

245
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,094
- Nothing. That's the problem.
- He kept putting it off.

246
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:49,863
He didn't wanna get married.
I don't know why he proposed.

247
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:52,269
What's the matter with you guys?

248
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:55,500
- They're all petrified to make a move.
- It's lack of spine, isn't it?

249
00:14:55,711 --> 00:14:58,145
Whatever you're talking about,
I'm sure you're right.

250
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,782
Mark, I need to talk to you.

251
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,952
Mary. Carol Hathaway in the ER.

252
00:15:04,119 --> 00:15:08,522
I'm not doing to good. One of my
nurses just got floated up to Neuro.

253
00:15:08,691 --> 00:15:11,888
I'm running a department here.
It doesn't benefit my nurses...

254
00:15:12,061 --> 00:15:14,086
...to be shifted
all over the hospital.

255
00:15:14,263 --> 00:15:19,132
No. You know what? She's not going
up. She's not going up to Neuro.

256
00:15:19,268 --> 00:15:21,236
Right. Right.

257
00:15:23,939 --> 00:15:28,171
- Hot stuff.
- Unfortunately, you still have to go.

258
00:15:28,377 --> 00:15:31,312
But this is the last time.
I made an appointment with her.

259
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,641
I'm gonna stop this.

260
00:15:33,816 --> 00:15:37,411
- Hang in there, Lydia.
- Don't worry about me.

261
00:15:37,586 --> 00:15:40,578
You can't put me in the middle
of your conflicts with Weaver.

262
00:15:40,756 --> 00:15:42,781
You can't, because
I'm not gonna be here.

263
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,188
I just trust your judgment.

264
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:49,695
I know what this is about,
and I'm having a hard time too.

265
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:53,892
I think we've both been spoiled
by what we have, the shorthand.

266
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:57,802
- It makes our jobs so much easier.
- Jobs. Right.

267
00:15:58,007 --> 00:16:01,067
In Phoenix, I'm afraid there won't
be a single person in the ER...

268
00:16:01,276 --> 00:16:03,710
...that I can talk to.
- They've got great doctors there.

269
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:07,042
They have great doctors here.
The best I've ever worked with.

270
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:10,674
- You can rely on them.
- Thanks for the pep talk.

271
00:16:12,655 --> 00:16:15,783
Mark, is there something else?

272
00:16:16,525 --> 00:16:18,755
No. No, nothing else.

273
00:16:18,927 --> 00:16:22,260
I could ask you
to consult on the hives in 4.

274
00:16:22,431 --> 00:16:25,059
It's time for us
to stand on our own two feet.

275
00:16:43,852 --> 00:16:45,251
Jeanie.

276
00:16:46,622 --> 00:16:48,055
Jeanie.

277
00:16:48,223 --> 00:16:50,453
Jeanie, I'm glad I caught you.

278
00:16:50,626 --> 00:16:53,527
- Did you get the mortgage papers back?
- No, that's what I wanted to tell you.

279
00:16:53,696 --> 00:16:56,756
- AI, you promised.
- I talked to this lawyer.

280
00:16:56,899 --> 00:17:00,335
He gave me some advice. And...

281
00:17:00,502 --> 00:17:02,197
Here.

282
00:17:03,572 --> 00:17:05,437
Everything you said
about our marriage.

283
00:17:05,641 --> 00:17:09,600
About how you carried all the weight.
That's gonna stop.

284
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:14,381
- What is this?
- Divorce papers.

285
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:18,883
I'm giving you the house, the car,
everything. And don't say no.

286
00:17:19,054 --> 00:17:20,749
It's not just because
you deserve it.

287
00:17:20,923 --> 00:17:24,188
This guy helped me figure out
that if I get my assets down...

288
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:26,418
...and showed
that my job has no insurance...

289
00:17:26,595 --> 00:17:30,463
...then I would get this state program
for the working poor.

290
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,725
They offer the drugs I need.
It's a good deal.

291
00:17:32,868 --> 00:17:35,268
But your income has to be
less than $ 15,000 a year.

292
00:17:35,437 --> 00:17:38,964
You don't have to worry
about me anymore. Okay?

293
00:17:39,174 --> 00:17:43,110
You just take care of yourself.
I gotta go.

294
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,814
Settle down. Hold her.

295
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,854
Thank God she was
passed out at Cubbie's.

296
00:17:56,024 --> 00:17:58,652
Bartender got worried after she
downed that sixth double bourbon.

297
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:02,228
- She looks full-term.
- Let go of me. I'm out of...

298
00:18:02,397 --> 00:18:05,764
No, you're not.
Security! We need Security!

299
00:18:05,901 --> 00:18:09,462
Damn! Damn this damn thing!

300
00:18:09,638 --> 00:18:12,471
Doyle, Ativan, two mg.
Ma'am, are you having contractions?

301
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:15,336
I need a drink. I need to...

302
00:18:15,544 --> 00:18:18,570
...get out of here!
- Restraints.

303
00:18:20,983 --> 00:18:24,919
You're not going anywhere.
Hold still, so we won't hurt your baby.

304
00:18:25,087 --> 00:18:28,579
Go ahead and kill it.
I never wanted the little bastard.

305
00:18:28,757 --> 00:18:30,657
- Too late to think about that now.
- Just sedate her.

306
00:18:30,826 --> 00:18:35,263
I'll kill myself and take it with me.
Damned thing ruined my life.

307
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:38,160
- You're pissing me off, lady.
- Hold on, Doyle.

308
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,928
- I wanna die.
- Look out.

309
00:18:41,103 --> 00:18:44,834
Her water broke.
We'd better get her up to OB.

310
00:18:45,908 --> 00:18:48,172
- Fetal alcohol syndrome on the way.
- Need some help?

311
00:18:48,343 --> 00:18:53,144
We could use some muscle here.
Doyle, take her up to OB.

312
00:18:53,315 --> 00:18:57,251
- She was trying to kill her baby.
- Alert Social Services.

313
00:18:57,419 --> 00:19:00,320
- Will they do anything?
- They'll try.

314
00:19:01,657 --> 00:19:03,852
Keep your legs together, honey.

315
00:19:04,026 --> 00:19:06,654
- That was ugly.
- It was criminal.

316
00:19:06,829 --> 00:19:09,627
- Chaplain, got a minute?
- Did you call for the last rites?

317
00:19:09,798 --> 00:19:13,962
No. I wanted to see if you were free
to see this woman. She's in labor.

318
00:19:14,102 --> 00:19:17,469
- Does she want a prayer?
- No. But I think her baby will.

319
00:19:17,673 --> 00:19:21,165
Got a brittle diabetic in 2. He
came in with a glucose level of 406.

320
00:19:21,376 --> 00:19:23,435
- Are you well? You look flushed.
- I'm fine.

321
00:19:23,645 --> 00:19:27,376
He hadn't taken his insulin. His BP
was 210 over 115. Off his dilt.

322
00:19:27,549 --> 00:19:30,848
I gave him both. But he wants to see
Susan. He always sees Dr. Lewis.

323
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:33,783
- I can take it.
- Okay.

324
00:19:33,956 --> 00:19:37,551
- Where's Dr. Lewis?
- She's busy right now. I'm Dr. Greene.

325
00:19:37,726 --> 00:19:40,923
We've d Ábrided
Mr. Ceebar's ulcerated ankle.

326
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:45,294
- Do you have an endocrinologist?
- Sort of.

327
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,961
The ER is really not the best place
for you to manage your diabetes.

328
00:19:49,137 --> 00:19:52,698
My ex stole 500 bucks from me.

329
00:19:52,908 --> 00:19:57,072
Upsetting, but still no reason for you
not to monitor your glucose.

330
00:19:57,246 --> 00:20:00,181
I wanted to tell Dr. Lewis.

331
00:20:00,349 --> 00:20:02,817
Well, you can't see her right now.

332
00:20:02,985 --> 00:20:06,751
Diabetes is a serious disease. You can
manage it if you follow the regimen.

333
00:20:06,922 --> 00:20:10,949
But if you neglect it, you're at risk
for kidney failure, blindness...

334
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:13,720
...and vascular disease.
- Why?

335
00:20:13,896 --> 00:20:17,457
- Why can't I see Dr. Lewis?
- Should I try to find her?

336
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:22,730
Look, Dr. Lewis is leaving us.
She's not gonna work here anymore.

337
00:20:22,905 --> 00:20:26,500
I didn't tell her about my car.
Somebody ran into it and didn't stop.

338
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:29,142
- Will you get Psych for Mr. Ceebar?
- I can find Dr...

339
00:20:29,344 --> 00:20:31,335
- Get Psych!
- Tell Dr. Lewis...

340
00:20:31,546 --> 00:20:35,778
Labs came back from the healthmobile.
Can you take a look at this CBC?

341
00:20:35,951 --> 00:20:37,919
- Crit's 28.
- Iron-deficiency anemia?

342
00:20:38,086 --> 00:20:41,419
No. Normal MCV, no blasts. Better
get this kid in for a follow-up.

343
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,820
It's Ahmed Lopez.
The baby that kid brought in.

344
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:47,587
Charlie? Sisters of Mercy Shelter?
I'll get the number.

345
00:20:47,763 --> 00:20:50,323
I need a hand here.

346
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,399
- What's the problem?
- I never felt better.

347
00:20:52,534 --> 00:20:56,231
The guy's coughing his head off.
Best to bring him here.

348
00:20:56,405 --> 00:20:58,805
- Now it's a crime to cough.
- Shut up and be grateful.

349
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:02,374
- I'll get a history.
- Cops get stranger all the time.

350
00:21:02,544 --> 00:21:06,310
- Don't worry. This isn't about you.
- Lydia.

351
00:21:06,481 --> 00:21:10,850
- She hates me, doesn't she?
- Well, she's pretty fed up.

352
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:14,079
I don't know how she got the idea
I didn't wanna get married.

353
00:21:14,256 --> 00:21:18,522
- You kept putting it off.
- That didn't mean I didn't want to.

354
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:22,027
- I know.
- You wanna be with her, be with her.

355
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:25,158
Yeah, you're right.

356
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,667
I woke up this morning,
and it was like I was dying.

357
00:21:28,837 --> 00:21:31,169
I couldn't breathe.
You ever get that?

358
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:34,069
- Yeah.
- I got so crazed.

359
00:21:34,276 --> 00:21:36,210
I tried to get the license.
I drove up to the church.

360
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:39,211
I tried to drag the priest over here
to marry us right now.

361
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,372
- Lf she'll have me.
- What happened?

362
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,951
They were all at a CPR class.

363
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:50,183
We do have a chaplain here
in the hospital if you're serious.

364
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:54,193
- Yeah?
- He's in Trauma 1, giving last rites.

365
00:22:00,836 --> 00:22:03,566
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy. Look at that.

366
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:06,367
- Where's the cecum?
- Can't see through all the small bowel.

367
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,373
It's pretty blue in here.
Let's eviscerate.

368
00:22:09,544 --> 00:22:11,341
You wanna take care
of that obstruction?

369
00:22:11,513 --> 00:22:14,107
Sure. Metz. Retractor.

370
00:22:14,282 --> 00:22:16,375
- Look different from a healthy gut?
- I'll say.

371
00:22:16,551 --> 00:22:19,145
Visualize the transduodenal
and peritoneal bands...

372
00:22:19,321 --> 00:22:22,017
...attached to the cecum
and the ascending colon.

373
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:24,658
- I am.
- I'm putting traction on this mass...

374
00:22:24,826 --> 00:22:27,420
...twisting it counterclockwise.
It's pretty tangled.

375
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:31,396
- Like a drawer full of socks.
- I have to remember that one.

376
00:22:31,533 --> 00:22:34,661
Okay, it's pinking up.
I don't think we have dead bowel.

377
00:22:35,303 --> 00:22:38,204
- Do you have it?
- Yeah.

378
00:22:39,207 --> 00:22:44,042
- Everything is turned around in here.
- Tell me if you need me.

379
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,413
You better take it.

380
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:53,645
Okay, retract the intestines. Metz.

381
00:22:53,822 --> 00:22:55,119
Pick up.

382
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,690
Baby's name is Ahmed,
mother's is Gloria.

383
00:22:57,859 --> 00:22:59,952
I don't know what she looks like.

384
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:03,154
- He doesn't remember the mother.
- He took the blood without consent.

385
00:23:03,398 --> 00:23:04,888
- I didn't hear that.
- That's great, Doug.

386
00:23:05,033 --> 00:23:09,663
I know that all of your residents
are single moms. If you...

387
00:23:09,838 --> 00:23:14,366
Okay, Sister, maybe I will.
Thank you. Thank you.

388
00:23:14,576 --> 00:23:17,909
- Don't ask.
- Don't worry, I won't.

389
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,380
- Has anybody seen Mr. Ceebar?
- Mr. Ceebar. A brittle diabetic?

390
00:23:22,551 --> 00:23:24,883
Yes. Psych is here,
but he's flown the coop.

391
00:23:25,053 --> 00:23:28,250
All he needs is five minutes of TLC
and a cup of hot tea.

392
00:23:28,423 --> 00:23:29,981
Well, he's gone now.

393
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:33,457
Hey, look at that.

394
00:23:33,628 --> 00:23:35,858
- Think he'll talk her into it?
- Shouldn't be too hard.

395
00:23:36,031 --> 00:23:38,522
- It's what she wants.
- Talk her into what?

396
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:41,465
Living happily ever after.

397
00:23:41,636 --> 00:23:44,867
- Sorry I couldn't step up.
- At least you knew you weren't ready.

398
00:23:45,073 --> 00:23:47,735
The malrotation was more disorienting
than I expected.

399
00:23:47,943 --> 00:23:51,743
90 percent of correcting a congenital
anomaly is knowing your embryology.

400
00:23:51,913 --> 00:23:55,405
- I had reviewed that.
- Then you had 90 percent aced.

401
00:23:55,584 --> 00:23:58,348
- What was the other 10 percent?
- Being able to stand there...

402
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,717
...and let the confused anatomy
start to make its own sense.

403
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:04,358
- How?
- By letting it happen.

404
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:09,691
Abnormalities in neonates can be
overwhelming if broken into parts.

405
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:12,459
Aristotle would have made
a lousy pediatric surgeon.

406
00:24:12,601 --> 00:24:15,570
Sorry to interrupt. They're calling
us from the ER. They need us.

407
00:24:15,737 --> 00:24:18,501
- What is it?
- A wedding.

408
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,044
Oh, my God! It wasn't a joke.

409
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:29,740
- Is this crazy?
- Yeah. This is crazy.

410
00:24:29,918 --> 00:24:31,613
Good thing you had
this old rag lying around.

411
00:24:31,786 --> 00:24:34,277
Make it snappy.
They only gave me 20 minutes off.

412
00:24:34,456 --> 00:24:38,017
- This veil is a little crushed.
- I'll go see if the coast is clear.

413
00:24:38,193 --> 00:24:40,388
Hold still. I don't wanna stick you.

414
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:42,052
- How do we look?
- No traumas coming in.

415
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,391
- Let's go while the radio is silent.
- Am I too late?

416
00:24:44,533 --> 00:24:47,593
No. Right this way.
Bride's side or groom's?

417
00:24:51,773 --> 00:24:54,503
- Okay. They're a little drippy.
- Yeah?

418
00:24:54,709 --> 00:24:56,643
All right, everybody.
They're ready, okay?

419
00:24:56,845 --> 00:24:59,780
Right over there.
That'll be good. Okay, ready?

420
00:25:17,666 --> 00:25:21,193
Dearly beloved...
Friends and colleagues...

421
00:25:21,369 --> 00:25:25,169
...we have come here today
as part of God's eternal plan...

422
00:25:25,373 --> 00:25:27,170
...and on the spur of the moment...

423
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:32,506
...to this holy place of life
and death and healing...

424
00:25:32,681 --> 00:25:36,173
...to join Lydia Wright and Alfred...

425
00:25:36,351 --> 00:25:38,216
- G... Grabarsky.
- Grabarsky.

426
00:25:38,386 --> 00:25:41,014
Anybody get a stool
culture on Curtain...

427
00:25:41,189 --> 00:25:44,124
Oh, my God! I'm sorry.

428
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,089
It's okay. I'll go.

429
00:25:46,261 --> 00:25:49,355
I did the rectal swab,
and his chart's in Exam 1.

430
00:25:49,531 --> 00:25:50,589
Best wishes, man.

431
00:25:50,732 --> 00:25:54,361
Like all of us here,
they've chosen as their life's work...

432
00:25:54,536 --> 00:25:57,300
...to care for
and protect their community.

433
00:25:57,472 --> 00:26:00,202
It's taxing and draining.

434
00:26:00,408 --> 00:26:02,672
And at times, it's dangerous work.

435
00:26:02,844 --> 00:26:06,245
Now Lydia and Alfred are taking on
the care and protection...

436
00:26:06,448 --> 00:26:08,075
...for each other
and the love they...

437
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:11,413
Dr. Benton sends his apologies.
He was called into an emergency.

438
00:26:11,586 --> 00:26:15,078
Today we witness and declare
the sacred union between two...

439
00:26:15,257 --> 00:26:16,656
Testicular torsion.

440
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,259
...souls that feed each other
with that love.

441
00:26:19,427 --> 00:26:22,294
It's a love that sustains
all their outer efforts.

442
00:26:22,464 --> 00:26:25,661
A love that is rare
and that should be treasured.

443
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:30,035
- A love that at times will glow...
- I need a hand here!

444
00:26:30,205 --> 00:26:33,936
...and yet at other times,
it will flicker.

445
00:26:34,142 --> 00:26:35,871
And now the vows.

446
00:26:36,077 --> 00:26:38,136
Do you Lydia take Alfred...

447
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:41,509
...to love and cherish from this day
forward till death do you part?

448
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:45,676
- I do.
- And you Alfred take Lydia...

449
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:49,813
...to love and cherish from this day
forward till death do you part?

450
00:26:49,991 --> 00:26:51,652
I do.

451
00:26:51,826 --> 00:26:54,317
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

452
00:26:55,263 --> 00:26:57,959
You may kiss your bride.

453
00:27:01,569 --> 00:27:03,833
Then he just handed you
the divorce papers?

454
00:27:04,005 --> 00:27:05,768
- It wasn't like him.
- What do you mean?

455
00:27:05,974 --> 00:27:07,874
It's the most unselfish thing
he's ever done.

456
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,409
- She's throwing the bouquet.
- Come on.

457
00:27:10,578 --> 00:27:12,739
No pushing now. Come on.

458
00:27:12,914 --> 00:27:17,647
- Hey, Carol. It's bouquet time.
- No, thank you.

459
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:20,253
Should we do the goodbye for Susan
now while everyone's here?

460
00:27:20,422 --> 00:27:23,016
No. We'll do it in an hour or so.

461
00:27:23,191 --> 00:27:25,887
- Did you see those two?
- You see them during the ceremony?

462
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,552
It's pathetic.
I figured those two'd make a go of it.

463
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:32,097
- Best friends. What more do you want?
- Not me. It's what Mark wants.

464
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:35,259
- Things happen or not for a reason.
- Why is she leaving?

465
00:27:35,437 --> 00:27:37,200
She doesn't have a life here.

466
00:27:37,372 --> 00:27:40,637
And one, two, three!

467
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:44,602
Oh, my God!

468
00:27:44,813 --> 00:27:47,008
- Oh, yeah, Susan!
- Yeah!

469
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:51,814
Congratulations!

470
00:27:51,986 --> 00:27:53,817
- You're next.
- Yeah, funny.

471
00:27:53,988 --> 00:27:58,891
- That was kind of great, huh?
- Yeah. They seem happy.

472
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,051
Hey, Mark...

473
00:28:01,229 --> 00:28:04,721
...I proved I'm no good at goodbyes.
- Me neither.

474
00:28:04,866 --> 00:28:08,529
- I'm sorry I snapped at you earlier.
- I just don't want to go...

475
00:28:08,703 --> 00:28:11,069
...unless I know
we'll always be friends.

476
00:28:11,239 --> 00:28:13,332
We will.

477
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:20,846
- You ready for me?
- Come on in. Almost there.

478
00:28:21,015 --> 00:28:24,041
Why don't you shut the door?

479
00:28:28,256 --> 00:28:31,054
So about your literature review.

480
00:28:31,226 --> 00:28:35,162
It's very complete.
I have a few quibbles about emphasis.

481
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:39,858
I'm not sure that Ladd warrants
an entire paragraph.

482
00:28:40,001 --> 00:28:43,437
- Probably not.
- But you have a very nice style.

483
00:28:43,605 --> 00:28:47,132
- Easy to read, not a lot of jargon.
- Thank you.

484
00:28:48,843 --> 00:28:51,812
I would ask you to co-author
if you weren't first-year.

485
00:28:52,013 --> 00:28:56,074
We need to be careful and not draw
a lot of attention considering...

486
00:28:56,251 --> 00:28:57,843
- Considering us?
- Yes.

487
00:28:58,019 --> 00:29:01,819
And what happened last Thursday
and Saturday afternoon and evening?

488
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,823
- Yes. And Tuesday before rounds.
- We can talk about that.

489
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:08,588
The only thing we need to keep
straight is that this is separate.

490
00:29:08,763 --> 00:29:10,822
- Completely separate.
- From my work.

491
00:29:10,965 --> 00:29:13,399
It shouldn't matter.
I'm not your boss.

492
00:29:13,568 --> 00:29:16,332
- You're my boss's boss.
- Did you lock the door?

493
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:20,031
Just so we both understand
that this is strictly personal.

494
00:29:20,241 --> 00:29:23,642
It has nothing to do with work.
Oh, I love that.

495
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:26,678
There are so many things
I'm not gonna miss about this place.

496
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,817
Aftercare documentation
is one of them.

497
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:32,714
I can't tell you how many hours
I've spent doing this.

498
00:29:32,887 --> 00:29:35,913
- You're the only one who ever bothers.
- You kidding me?

499
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:38,251
Yeah.

500
00:29:38,426 --> 00:29:40,792
- She's gonna leave at 2:00.
- Are they setting up?

501
00:29:40,962 --> 00:29:42,429
In the lounge.

502
00:29:42,597 --> 00:29:45,259
I got a call from the D.A. Today...

503
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,927
...about a drunk woman
who came in in labor.

504
00:29:49,103 --> 00:29:51,469
They're charging her
for attempted murder.

505
00:29:51,673 --> 00:29:55,769
- Social Services jumped on that one.
- They're acting on a call from us.

506
00:29:55,977 --> 00:29:58,445
You've seen that
crayon-in-the-nose trick before?

507
00:29:58,646 --> 00:30:01,114
Doctor, the address
for Sisters of Mercy.

508
00:30:01,316 --> 00:30:03,648
Yeah. We can handle it together.

509
00:30:03,818 --> 00:30:07,515
Dr. Doyle, did you make a call
to the 32nd Precinct today?

510
00:30:07,689 --> 00:30:10,453
Yeah. I got a cousin there.

511
00:30:11,025 --> 00:30:13,084
She wanted to kill her baby.
I was a witness.

512
00:30:13,261 --> 00:30:15,661
We get a lot of women here
with alcohol and drug problems.

513
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:19,493
- We let Social Services handle it.
- It can fall through the cracks.

514
00:30:19,634 --> 00:30:23,229
Initiating criminal investigation
wasn't your job.

515
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:25,565
But protecting the health of the baby.
Is that my job?

516
00:30:25,773 --> 00:30:28,640
We won't improve
prenatal care for high-risk infants...

517
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:31,108
...if we scare off the mothers.
- How about this?

518
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:35,613
If I get to testify against the bitch,
I'll do it on my own time.

519
00:30:35,783 --> 00:30:38,183
I think we're gonna like her.

520
00:30:38,353 --> 00:30:41,379
Randi, could you
try and find me some aspirin?

521
00:30:41,556 --> 00:30:45,185
It doesn't work for us. We never had
floats in and out of the department.

522
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,160
- Budgets are tight, Carol.
- We're all aware of that.

523
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:51,560
The hospital values
its registered nurses.

524
00:30:51,699 --> 00:30:56,193
RNs are the best trained and most
versatile part of the nursing staff.

525
00:30:56,371 --> 00:31:00,432
We are also the most
expensive part of that staff.

526
00:31:00,642 --> 00:31:05,136
County has got to figure out ways
to utilize RNs more effectively.

527
00:31:05,346 --> 00:31:09,544
- At least have the floats make sense.
- Go on.

528
00:31:10,151 --> 00:31:12,881
ER and ICU have
more skills in common...

529
00:31:13,054 --> 00:31:16,080
...than ward nurses,
Recovery or Neuro.

530
00:31:16,257 --> 00:31:18,452
That's a very good point, Carol.

531
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:22,062
That is precisely why
I keep trying to get you managers...

532
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:24,994
...who are in the trenches,
more active on the committees.

533
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:28,694
- We need your perspective.
- Mary, I'm swamped.

534
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:30,667
Okay, how about a deal?

535
00:31:30,838 --> 00:31:33,966
I can find ER floats
to ICU per your suggestion.

536
00:31:34,175 --> 00:31:37,702
In exchange, you sit on the hospital-
wide re-engineering committee.

537
00:31:37,912 --> 00:31:40,506
We only meet once a month.

538
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:49,752
- I stalled her with one last patient.
- Good. She was out the door.

539
00:31:49,924 --> 00:31:52,085
Mr. Frick will keep her busy
for a while.

540
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:55,286
- You got any tape?
- Yeah. Is Mark coming?

541
00:31:55,463 --> 00:31:58,796
- I beeped him twice.
- Sorry, folks. MVA coming in.

542
00:31:58,933 --> 00:32:02,596
Kindergarten carpool
versus joy-riding teens.

543
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:06,206
- Could be as many as eight victims.
- There goes the party.

544
00:32:06,374 --> 00:32:09,104
- What's the ETA?
- They're pulling up now.

545
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:11,335
Let's go. Come on.

546
00:32:13,615 --> 00:32:16,311
That's me.
Runner-up for Mr. Universe.

547
00:32:16,484 --> 00:32:19,942
Call me a fool, doc.
But I'm betting on a comeback.

548
00:32:20,121 --> 00:32:23,022
Haven't changed a lick since 1947.

549
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:26,627
I'm afraid you may have lost
too much weight recently.

550
00:32:26,794 --> 00:32:30,161
I'm in training. Midwestern finals.

551
00:32:30,331 --> 00:32:34,062
American bodybuilders. 70 and older.

552
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:37,629
Gotta take care of this damn sciatica.

553
00:32:37,805 --> 00:32:41,639
- Oh, man. That smarts.
- Why don't you take a seat again?

554
00:32:41,809 --> 00:32:45,973
- Do you know how this happened?
- My B-12 shot. Must have hit a nerve.

555
00:32:46,147 --> 00:32:50,140
- You're injecting vitamins?
- I stay clear of steroids.

556
00:32:50,318 --> 00:32:52,513
That's good. Scoot back.

557
00:32:52,687 --> 00:32:56,521
Press against my hands.
Yeah, good.

558
00:32:56,691 --> 00:33:00,024
- Any other complaints?
- No. Best I've looked in 10 years.

559
00:33:00,194 --> 00:33:04,961
- When's the competition?
- Mid-March. I'll be 74 by then.

560
00:33:05,099 --> 00:33:07,226
- And ready for a comeback.
- You think?

561
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:12,396
Yeah. Plenty of bed rest, anti-
inflammatories and start back slowly.

562
00:33:13,675 --> 00:33:16,109
- Thanks, doc.
- Okay.

563
00:33:20,381 --> 00:33:22,281
- Fractured tib-fib.
- Honey, you're gonna be fine.

564
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:24,350
Order a portable C-spine
and left tib-fib.

565
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:27,716
Come with me this way.
I'll find you a place to sit.

566
00:33:27,889 --> 00:33:31,791
- My mom and dad are gonna kill me.
- I'll tell them it was my fault.

567
00:34:01,522 --> 00:34:06,152
- Signing out, Randi.
- Thanks. Good luck in Phoenix.

568
00:34:06,327 --> 00:34:10,263
No. This is the ER again.
We need a neurosurgeon now!

569
00:34:11,432 --> 00:34:15,766
Get him to the Suture Room.
Set me up with some 4.0 nylon.

570
00:34:16,938 --> 00:34:19,463
You have a ruptured spleen.
You need surgery.

571
00:34:19,674 --> 00:34:22,336
It's my carpool.
All the parents need to be called.

572
00:34:22,543 --> 00:34:25,603
Randi, come here
and take these numbers down.

573
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:28,509
- I told you not to let him drive.
- He told me he knew how.

574
00:34:28,683 --> 00:34:31,174
- We were just goofing around.
- Hush! Hold still.

575
00:34:31,352 --> 00:34:33,843
Complains of chest pains,
shortness of breath.

576
00:34:34,021 --> 00:34:36,512
Diminished breath sounds on the left.
Get me a chest-tube tray.

577
00:34:36,691 --> 00:34:39,023
We need an abdominal CT
for the kid in Trauma 1.

578
00:34:39,193 --> 00:34:42,959
- BP's coming down. 190 over 130.
- Poor cap refill. Pulse ox 90.

579
00:34:43,131 --> 00:34:46,066
Type and cross two units.
O-neg on the rapid infuser.

580
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,260
- X-ray's coming for the C-spine.
- Anybody need any help?

581
00:34:49,437 --> 00:34:54,568
- Susan, what are you still doing here?
- You're gonna miss your train.

582
00:34:54,776 --> 00:34:56,903
- Call us.
- Get some O-negative too.

583
00:34:57,111 --> 00:34:59,636
BP's 200 over 140.
Left pupil's sluggish.

584
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:02,281
- Dusky, you wanna intubate?
- Yes.

585
00:35:02,483 --> 00:35:05,475
7.0 ET tube.

586
00:35:05,653 --> 00:35:08,281
Possible subdural hematoma.

587
00:35:08,456 --> 00:35:13,484
Mannitol, 90 grams IV.
Let's hyperventilate him. All right?

588
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:18,096
- Here you go.
- Okay.

589
00:35:18,232 --> 00:35:20,427
Use suction if you need it.

590
00:35:26,674 --> 00:35:29,234
Take your time.
He's breathing on his own.

591
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:35,944
- She didn't even leave a note.
- She was saying goodbye all day.

592
00:35:36,117 --> 00:35:39,143
- One of the kids crashed in Radiology.
- Which one?

593
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,618
- The fractured tib-fib.
- How did it happen?

594
00:35:41,789 --> 00:35:43,814
If it's okay, I'd love
to get out of here by 7.

595
00:35:43,991 --> 00:35:47,950
- You working on the literature review?
- No. I got a date.

596
00:35:48,129 --> 00:35:51,121
Don't procrastinate and keep Keaton
waiting. It reflects poorly on me.

597
00:35:51,265 --> 00:35:53,699
- She's a hard one to get, isn't she?
- How do you figure?

598
00:35:53,868 --> 00:35:56,462
She's a great surgeon,
but not much of a teacher.

599
00:35:56,637 --> 00:35:59,367
- You don't think so?
- Come on. All that psychobabble?

600
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:03,169
- Her explanations can be eccentric.
- She doesn't say what she wants.

601
00:36:03,377 --> 00:36:07,643
Sometimes she does. But I haven't
been working with her like you have.

602
00:36:07,815 --> 00:36:11,876
She's soft.
She doesn't act like a surgeon.

603
00:36:12,053 --> 00:36:15,955
It is difficult to learn from someone
who teaches by intuition.

604
00:36:16,123 --> 00:36:18,023
Which I appreciate
about your teaching.

605
00:36:18,192 --> 00:36:20,092
Excuse me, Carter. Carla?

606
00:36:21,028 --> 00:36:23,496
There you are.
I've been here for half an hour.

607
00:36:23,664 --> 00:36:24,961
Why?

608
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:28,000
- Kingston Mines. Dinner?
- That's tomorrow night.

609
00:36:28,169 --> 00:36:30,831
- No, that's tonight.
- Anything you need?

610
00:36:31,005 --> 00:36:34,099
- No, Carter. I'm sorry.
- Carla, this is Dr. Carter.

611
00:36:34,308 --> 00:36:37,106
- Carter, this is Carla Reece.
- Pleased to meet you.

612
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,712
I'm sorry.
I'm on till midnight tonight.

613
00:36:39,914 --> 00:36:42,439
This is where you work until midnight.

614
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:45,518
- I'll walk you to your car.
- You've never been here?

615
00:36:45,686 --> 00:36:48,177
- No, I haven't.
- I should give you a tour.

616
00:36:48,356 --> 00:36:51,291
- She's got plans.
- No. I've been stood up.

617
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,757
If Trauma 1 is open,
we could start there.

618
00:36:53,928 --> 00:36:58,160
- Don't show me anything bloody.
- No, no. What do you do, Carla?

619
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:01,632
- I have this Caribbean restaurant.
- No kidding?

620
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:04,999
My family used to sail
to the islands every spring.

621
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,132
Half day Dr. Ross?

622
00:37:08,342 --> 00:37:10,435
I was immunizing when you
were hitting the snooze button.

623
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:13,773
I'm upset because I don't understand
how you could send a surgical...

624
00:37:13,948 --> 00:37:16,348
I asked if I should send him
for a CT. You said, "Go ahead."

625
00:37:16,517 --> 00:37:19,418
- I assumed he was stable.
- No, I asked for your call.

626
00:37:19,587 --> 00:37:22,112
You weren't listening.
You were distracted.

627
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:25,521
You were looking for Susan,
worried she'd left. I understand.

628
00:37:25,693 --> 00:37:27,388
But don't yell at me now.

629
00:37:27,561 --> 00:37:30,860
Mark, grab your coat. Let's go talk.

630
00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:35,091
- Admin actually listened?
- So no more floating?

631
00:37:35,269 --> 00:37:36,964
You laid down the law.

632
00:37:37,138 --> 00:37:40,232
They won't be sending you
to Neuro or the wards anymore.

633
00:37:40,441 --> 00:37:42,306
They're gonna limit
our floats to ICU.

634
00:37:42,476 --> 00:37:45,104
- How's that any better?
- Similar nursing skills.

635
00:37:45,313 --> 00:37:47,110
We have to get it in our contract.

636
00:37:47,281 --> 00:37:50,682
- Only way they'll respect us.
- They'll never respect us.

637
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:52,978
Dr. Weaver is wondering
where the nurses are.

638
00:37:53,154 --> 00:37:56,123
I don't think it's so
bad floating to I.C.U.

639
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:58,281
- I'm not going.
- They won't send you.

640
00:37:58,459 --> 00:38:00,450
You're not close enough
to your 20 years.

641
00:38:00,628 --> 00:38:03,961
It's a compromise, but it's
better than what was happening.

642
00:38:04,098 --> 00:38:08,933
Careful, Carol. You sound
an awful lot like management.

643
00:38:09,103 --> 00:38:11,901
- I didn't even say goodbye.
- That's not what you need to tell her.

644
00:38:12,106 --> 00:38:14,199
- Too late now.
- When does her train leave?

645
00:38:14,408 --> 00:38:18,003
- 4:20.
- Under one hour. They're usually late.

646
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:22,842
- She went home to get her luggage.
- I'm on till 11.

647
00:38:23,017 --> 00:38:25,679
- You think I should just go?
- You could.

648
00:38:25,853 --> 00:38:29,584
It's impossible. She's getting
on a train. She's made up her mind.

649
00:38:29,757 --> 00:38:31,884
It may be. But that's not the point.

650
00:38:33,427 --> 00:38:36,555
- What would I say now?
- What you wanted to for years.

651
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,961
You tell her how you feel or...

652
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:42,501
...let her go without a word and
regret it for the rest of your life.

653
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:45,696
And make yourself and everybody
else around you miserable...

654
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:48,636
...like you have today.

655
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,772
You're right.

656
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:55,247
- Wait. Can you tell Kerry...?
- Go, go, go!

657
00:38:57,618 --> 00:39:01,019
This is great. Oh, my goodness!

658
00:39:01,188 --> 00:39:04,783
- Is this where you operate on them?
- We stabilize them here.

659
00:39:04,959 --> 00:39:09,123
- Then we send them upstairs to the O.R.
- Speaking of upstairs.

660
00:39:09,296 --> 00:39:12,959
- Nice meeting you, Carla.
- Yes, thank you for showing me around.

661
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:17,093
- What's in here?
- Just the Suture Room.

662
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:18,761
What goes on in here?

663
00:39:18,973 --> 00:39:22,636
We just take patients
down here that we need to...

664
00:39:32,186 --> 00:39:36,589
You're gonna mess up
my reputation around here.

665
00:39:36,757 --> 00:39:40,193
I've been wanting to do that
since I came into this place.

666
00:39:40,361 --> 00:39:42,761
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

667
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:45,797
I'm sorry I got to work late.

668
00:39:45,933 --> 00:39:48,697
Well, there's late and...

669
00:39:48,869 --> 00:39:51,201
...there's later.

670
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,265
Taxi!

671
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:31,741
Pull up.

672
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:00,002
Susan?

673
00:41:01,509 --> 00:41:04,137
- Suse, are you here?
- Dr. Greene. You just missed her.

674
00:41:04,345 --> 00:41:07,576
She left you a note on the mantel.

675
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:20,019
- Is that clock right, Sister?
- Oh, yes.

676
00:41:20,194 --> 00:41:23,095
I must be slow. I got a friend
trying to catch a train.

677
00:41:23,264 --> 00:41:26,062
Sister Anne, try to get them to share.

678
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,361
We haven't had a Lopez all month.

679
00:41:28,536 --> 00:41:32,597
- It's a mother and an infant.
- I know, doctor. I'm sorry.

680
00:41:32,806 --> 00:41:36,003
You could leave a note on the board.

681
00:42:14,048 --> 00:42:16,107
Go! Go! Go, man!

682
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:58,685
Southwest train.

683
00:42:59,627 --> 00:43:01,561
Track 10.

684
00:43:15,576 --> 00:43:20,036
Looking for the chief, sir?
She got moved. Track 6.

685
00:43:23,217 --> 00:43:25,151
Susan!

686
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:26,946
Susan!

687
00:43:29,957 --> 00:43:31,424
Susan!

688
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:34,220
Susan! Susan!

689
00:43:34,395 --> 00:43:36,989
- All aboard!
- Susan!

690
00:43:38,265 --> 00:43:40,597
Mark? Are you okay?

691
00:43:41,602 --> 00:43:45,038
- You came to say goodbye?
- No. Stay.

692
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:47,503
I want you to stay.

693
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,801
- But, Mark...
- I love you.

694
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:53,741
And I'm stupid
for not saying it before.

695
00:43:53,914 --> 00:43:56,075
No. It's okay. I knew.

696
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:59,879
- In a way, I knew.
- Aboard!

697
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:03,217
Stay. We belong together.

698
00:44:04,658 --> 00:44:07,024
Tell me you don't feel the same.

699
00:44:11,799 --> 00:44:14,791
I'm sorry.

700
00:44:14,968 --> 00:44:17,061
Train's leaving, ma'am.

701
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:20,263
- We're right together.
- Mark...

702
00:44:20,474 --> 00:44:23,875
...you're my best friend. I don't
know how I'll make it without you.

703
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:27,241
- Don't go.
- I have to.

704
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:32,078
I don't belong here. I have a new
life going in a different direction.

705
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:34,914
Susan, I don't wanna lose you.

706
00:44:48,202 --> 00:44:52,195
- Ma'am, we're leaving.
- I'll never forget you.

707
00:44:56,009 --> 00:44:58,170
- I do love you.
- What?

708
00:44:58,379 --> 00:45:01,837
I love you!

709
00:45:03,217 --> 00:45:05,014
Bye.
