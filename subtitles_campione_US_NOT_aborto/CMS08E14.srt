1
00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:07,816
I heard you and 2.0 are
a match made in heaven.

2
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:09,676
Well, it's a remarkable advancement.

3
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:10,969
Need an OR.

4
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:12,429
2.0 is open.

5
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,930
Better imaging's available.

6
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,015
Emergent trauma is not the time

7
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,307
to play with your fancy toy.

8
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:22,147
Things haven't been great
between Ben and I.

9
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,858
I know it must be hard
not having him around.

10
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,067
Ben?

11
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:28,028
Sorry it took me so long.

12
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,323
I probably shot up,

13
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:35,535
like, a half dozen times
during my first trimester.

14
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,495
Going cold turkey is really hard.

15
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:40,749
I don't want anyone taking my baby away.

16
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,386
Hello?

17
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,388
Hey. No, no, no, no.

18
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,849
Hey. What did I tell you?

19
00:00:56,874 --> 00:00:58,600
Day or night. Doesn't matter.

20
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,560
What's going on?

21
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,647
You... you're having an urge to use?

22
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:06,649
Uh-huh.

23
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,575
OK. Can you get yourself to Med?

24
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,819
I can pick you up.

25
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,780
OK, great.

26
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,157
OK. I'll meet you in the ED.

27
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,241
Wow.

28
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:18,745
So Ben moved back home?

29
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:19,950
End of last week.

30
00:01:19,975 --> 00:01:22,916
Wow. I'm so glad to hear that.

31
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:26,002
It was like this huge cloud
has just lifted.

32
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,249
I'll bet.

33
00:01:27,274 --> 00:01:29,105
Thanks for being a shoulder
throughout all this, Sharon.

34
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,423
Always.

35
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,092
The result of over a decade's worth

36
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,219
of testing and research,

37
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,804
here at Gaffney Chicago Medical Center.

38
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,889
They're doing infomercials for 2.0 now?

39
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:40,183
Jack Dayton insisted.

40
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:43,103
But I have a budget meeting to get to,

41
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,647
so enjoy the show.

42
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,023
I will.

43
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:49,651
Predict complications
before they happen,

44
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:54,531
generate highly accurate
imaging in real time.

45
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:59,369
The OR 2.0 is to surgery
what GPS was to travel.

46
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:01,833
Nitrazine swab.

47
00:02:01,858 --> 00:02:03,623
I've noticed more discharge.

48
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,918
And the baby doesn't seem
to be moving around as much.

49
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:09,379
She usually kicks up a storm.

50
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:13,008
I told Hannah that she's
gonna be a flamenco dancer.

51
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:15,135
So you two know each other?

52
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,471
Yeah, we go to the same gym.

53
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,766
OK.

54
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:24,728
- So your water broke, Liza.
- What?

55
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:27,272
But I'm not due for, like, another week.

56
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,690
You see this?

57
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,151
When this touches
amniotic fluid, it turns blue.

58
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,320
That also explains why you
stopped feeling much movement.

59
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,366
After your water breaks,
the baby has less room to wiggle around.

60
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:41,036
- Is she gonna be OK?
- Yes.

61
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:43,163
This just means we need
to get you upstairs

62
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,707
and give you medicine to induce labor.

63
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,460
Can you let L&D know Liza's coming up
and page Dr. Patchefsky?

64
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,170
- Sure thing.
- Thanks.

65
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,755
- Dr. Patchefsky?
- Mm-hmm.

66
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:55,008
No, no, no. I-I want you.

67
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,551
Well, Liza, I'm sorry,

68
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,012
but unfortunately,
I need to stay in the ED.

69
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:02,015
But hey, Dr. Patchefsky's
gonna take great care

70
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,767
of you and the baby.

71
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:06,811
You know me, Hannah.
You know my history.

72
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:10,857
I don't feel comfortable
with anybody else.

73
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,192
Please.

74
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,153
I can't do this without you.

75
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,446
OK.

76
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,951
Let me see what I can figure out.

77
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:24,371
- Dr. Marcel?
- Yeah?

78
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,039
There's the movie star.

79
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,374
- Oh, come on now.
- Oh!

80
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,875
Can I get your autograph?

81
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,066
- Jack roped me into it.
- Sure he did.

82
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:33,210
Need some help over here!

83
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:36,132
Hey. What happened?

84
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,426
Rob here, he was working
a circular saw, and...

85
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,136
He was slicing some sheet metal.

86
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,805
- He cut himself.
- Follow me.

87
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,223
Number three's open.

88
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,101
- How long ago did this happen?
- Not exactly sure.

89
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:48,561
I found Rob by the machine
about 20 minutes ago.

90
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,688
He was just lying in a pool

91
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,064
- of his own blood.
- Let's get him up.

92
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,899
We were working at a job site
around the corner.

93
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,734
We just thought it'd be fastest
to bring him ourselves.

94
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,152
- OK. Mag?
- Yes. Gentlemen.

95
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,570
Why don't I show you
where the waiting room is at?

96
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,489
Dr. Marcel will update you
as soon as possible.

97
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,574
Wait, wait. What do I do with this?

98
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,910
- Dr. Marcel?
- Yeah?

99
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:07,914
We do the right thing?

100
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,458
Thought you're supposed
to put it on ice.

101
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,419
Yes, you did the right thing.

102
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,462
Thank you.

103
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:15,588
Thank you, gentlemen.

104
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,924
It's OK. I got you, bud.

105
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:31,642

106
00:04:35,304 --> 00:04:37,200
Liza doesn't have a primary OB

107
00:04:37,225 --> 00:04:38,712
but I've seen her in the ED
throughout her pregnancy

108
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:40,238
for various complaints.

109
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,573
Doris, room seven.

110
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,742
There's a hypochondriac with a hangnail.

111
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,326
- So get an intern on it?
- Yeah, read my mind.

112
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,620
Dr. Hudgins, you're needed
in treatment seven.

113
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,039
I'm sorry. You were saying?

114
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,041
My patient, Liza Martin,
doesn't have a primary OB.

115
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,834
OK. Yeah, I heard all this.
What's the ask?

116
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,711
I'd like to follow her
upstairs and deliver her.

117
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,379
You're my only OB in the ED.

118
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,757
I can come back and forth
while she's in early labor.

119
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,592
And I'm also just an elevator ride away

120
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:01,926
in case something urgent comes up.

121
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:05,597
But I'm Liza's only continuity, so...

122
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:07,974
You know, she's comfortable with me.

123
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,060
We go back a ways.

124
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,186
Yeah. OK, go ahead.

125
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:13,980
- Really?
- Yeah, just don't dillydally.

126
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,732
Yes, sir.

127
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,817
As you know, we have a seat
opening up on the board.

128
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,820
Oh. Did you get a chance
to review my nominee?

129
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,947
I sent her CV around.

130
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:24,949
Sorry. Remind me the candidate's...

131
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,451
Gloria Jeffers.

132
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,746
She's chaired the fundraising
committee for eight years.

133
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,915
She volunteers here regularly.

134
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:34,250
She brings a lot of donors to Med.

135
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,878
Oh, well, sounds like
a strong candidate.

136
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,213
She is.

137
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,632
Now, are you familiar
with Dr. George Thomas?

138
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:44,969
Well, the name rings a bell,
but I'm not placing it right offhand.

139
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,180
Well, George is a close friend,

140
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,725
a renowned urologist,
and a former Wisconsin state legislator.

141
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,310
Now, he's mostly retired

142
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,271
but still lobbies for some
biotech companies part-time.

143
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:59,317
I think that his connections
could be very advantageous for us.

144
00:05:59,936 --> 00:06:04,670
While my nominee is just
simply a devoted volunteer?

145
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,495
Look, Sharon, I'm not gonna try
to make you into a turncoat,

146
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,023
but take a lunch with George?

147
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:15,875
Um, of course.

148
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,712
Just give his information
to my assistant,

149
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,296
and we'll get something on the books.

150
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,048
Well, I hope you don't mind,
but I already took the liberty

151
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,591
of talking with your assistant,

152
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:26,136
and it turns out
you're free for lunch today.

153
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,345
What are you saying?

154
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,973
And as luck would have it, so is George.

155
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,057
Is that right?

156
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,976
1:00 in the executive dining room?

157
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,936
And I assume you'll be joining us?

158
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:38,314
Oh, listen, I wish I could,
but I am slammed with meetings today.

159
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:41,484
I'll be sure to check in
afterwards, though.

160
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:42,944
You know, Sharon,

161
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,196
I really think you two
are gonna hit it off.

162
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:51,619
You just hang in there.

163
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,538
And I'll get you an update soon, OK?

164
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:56,374
All right.

165
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,003
That was Rob's wife, Louisa.

166
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:02,047
Was getting her up to speed.

167
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:04,466
What are the odds
that he'll keep his hand?

168
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:06,051
Not good.

169
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:08,636
Immediate replantation is impossible.

170
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,138
Too much contamination?

171
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,807
Yeah, well, the proximal stump's

172
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,726
gonna need at least a week
of daily debridement

173
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:15,894
just to get it cleaned up.

174
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:18,188
- Real shame too.
- What do you mean?

175
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:21,566
'Cause the hand's actually in
good shape, all things considered.

176
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:22,984
I'll bet it's salvageable.

177
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,278
Maximum six hours
without blood flow, and...

178
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,030
Hand's gonna die.

179
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,115
Yeah.

180
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,659
But what about putting it
on a perfusion pump,

181
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,912
like you would with a heart and lungs?

182
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,914
Well, it's a good thought, but...

183
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:37,707
that won't buy us more than a day.

184
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:41,670
If only we could find a way
to perfuse the hand long-term.

185
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,897
Well, but like you said, it's a shame.

186
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,764
Jackie, going to treatment four.

187
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:54,683
Got it. This is Isaac Collins.

188
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:57,060
53-year-old male.
Motor vehicle collision.

189
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,688
Ambulatory at the scene,
refused board and collar.

190
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:01,606
- He was rear-ended.
- My fault, though.

191
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:02,941
Facial bruising's from the airbag.

192
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:05,380
I switched lanes without signaling,

193
00:08:05,405 --> 00:08:06,986
then jammed on the brakes
to make a turn.

194
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,488
It was a bonehead move.

195
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,091
Luckily, the other guy's all right.

196
00:08:10,116 --> 00:08:11,116
Glad to hear it.

197
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,118
I'm Dr. Halstead, by the way. Vitals?

198
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,370
Blood pressure's a little high, 150/97.

199
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:19,124
I'm always hypertensive,
especially when I'm due for dialysis.

200
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,251
I've got end-stage renal disease.

201
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,081
I appreciate you letting me know.

202
00:08:23,106 --> 00:08:25,275
On my count, folks. One, two, three.

203
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,091
Thanks, guys.

204
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:32,095
I see you've got a fistula.

205
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,097
Yeah, I've been through a few of 'em.

206
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,558
Going on five years of dialysis.

207
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,727
- Dr. Cuevas.
- Isaac.

208
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:41,062
Dr. Jones told me the good news.

209
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:44,315
I was hoping I would see you
today, but not in the ED.

210
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,483
What happened?

211
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,569
She's my shrink.

212
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,988
I'm actually not, Isaac.

213
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,698
Do you mind if I disclose
to Dr. Halstead

214
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:52,950
how we know each other?

215
00:08:52,975 --> 00:08:56,369
My wife, Samantha, and I
attend Dr. Cuevas's support group.

216
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,788
For patients and families
living with chronic illness.

217
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,066
Which, by tomorrow, won't be us anymore,

218
00:09:01,091 --> 00:09:04,345
which leads me as to why
I was driving like a maniac.

219
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,504
I got the call.

220
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,839
I'm getting a new kidney.

221
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,424
Congratulations.

222
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:11,009
Anyways, you can see I couldn't wait

223
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,302
to get to the hospital fast enough.

224
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,971
But I'm fine.

225
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,140
Like I told the paramedics,
nothing feels broken.

226
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,852
Now, when you say nothing feels broken,
anything feel tender?

227
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:23,188
No, I'm good, really.

228
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:26,983
You know, Isaac,
when I spoke to Dr. Jones,

229
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:31,363
he said that the organ wouldn't
even be here for several hours.

230
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:32,822
There's no rush.

231
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,825
Why don't you let Dr. Halstead
check you out properly?

232
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,120
Neck and back's a little sore, I guess,

233
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,956
but it's really not that bad.

234
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,918
I just don't want anything
to mess up the surgery.

235
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,754
Well, even if you have
a sprain or a minor fracture,

236
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,381
it shouldn't postpone the transplant.

237
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:52,425
But better Dr. Jones
and his surgical team know.

238
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:56,179
That way, they can avoid
aggravating any injury further.

239
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:59,683
All right. Yeah, makes sense.

240
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:03,061
Let's get a CT of the CTLS spine.

241
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,943
- Sorry I keep you waiting.
- Mm.

242
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,696
- I was talking with my friend.
- No prob.

243
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:16,741
Chamomile tea, blueberry
muffin, chocolate croissant.

244
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:20,620
You're very sweet, but I can't eat.

245
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,372
My stomach is in knots.

246
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:23,707
What's up?

247
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:26,668
My friend thinks we may
be out of work very soon.

248
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,253
What?

249
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:30,588
Is this about your union's renegotiation

250
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:31,756
- with the hospital?
- Yeah.

251
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,008
Well, I knew they were
trying to iron out

252
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:34,426
a new contract, but I mean, honestly,

253
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:36,219
I haven't been paying
that close attention.

254
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,096
She says talks are breaking down,

255
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:42,267
that neither side will budge,
and the union may ask for a vote.

256
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,978
A strike authorization vote?

257
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:49,441
If I miss work for weeks, even for days,

258
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:50,650
this is not good.

259
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,861
I send money home to my parents.

260
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,404
But I mean, even if a vote passes,

261
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,448
that doesn't mean they're gonna strike.

262
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:57,782
It just gives them more ammunition

263
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,909
when they go back to the table.

264
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,620
These things, you know,
tend to take time.

265
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,290
You've got to let it play out.

266
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:09,002
I'm guessing they're gonna make a deal.

267
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,838
I think it's gonna be OK.

268
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,640
She just started having
fetal heart rate decelerations

269
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,601
with tetanic contractions.

270
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:25,643
I turned down the Pit.

271
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,645
Hannah, it hurts so much.

272
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,147
OK, stop the Pitocin.

273
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:31,149
Liza, we're gonna see
if it's time to push yet, OK?

274
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:34,069
Can you bend your knees for me?
I'm gonna check you out.

275
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,447
OK, you're only
about six centimeters dilated.

276
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:38,865
- What?
- We need to get you

277
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,283
onto your hands and knees
to let us help you

278
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,659
- turn you over, OK?
- What's going on?

279
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:42,994
What's wrong?

280
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:44,829
Your umbilical cord is
being squeezed somewhere.

281
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:48,208
That's what's causing
the baby's heart rate to drop.

282
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:51,044
Moving positions can help
relieve the compression.

283
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,798
I know. I know.

284
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:57,275
All right. I'm gonna check you out.

285
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,260
Uterus is still rock hard.

286
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,097
Let's give her
0.25 of terbutaline, sub-q.

287
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:04,224
Liza, you can lie back down now, OK?

288
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:07,519
- Gently.
- Gentle.

289
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,896
We're trying a uterine relaxant.

290
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,356
Now, if this doesn't work,

291
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:13,274
we're gonna need to deliver
your baby via C-section.

292
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,777
- Let's get an OR ready.
- No, I don't want that.

293
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,362
It's OK. Just one step at a time.

294
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:20,073
Let's first see
if this medicine works, OK?

295
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:26,079
Baby's heart rate's coming up.

296
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,415
That's really good.

297
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,547
Give it about a half hour,
and restart the Pitocin slowly.

298
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:37,465
- Mm-hmm.
- But let's keep an OR ready.

299
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,137
If the baby's heart rate
drops like that,

300
00:12:39,162 --> 00:12:40,782
I'm doing an emergency C-section.

301
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:53,373
So you want
to surgically attach Rob's hand

302
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:54,983
to the back of his leg?

303
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:57,569
It's called ectopic banking.

304
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:01,114
You see, what the hand needs
in order to survive

305
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,532
is adequate blood flow.

306
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,492
And his leg can provide that?

307
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:07,495
The posterior tibial artery,
to be exact.

308
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:11,583
The PTA, it runs along
the back of the lower leg.

309
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:15,077
So you'd bank my hand

310
00:13:15,102 --> 00:13:18,091
on my leg for a week or so?

311
00:13:18,116 --> 00:13:19,591
That's right.

312
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:21,176
And then you'll reattach it
to my arm, right?

313
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:22,802
More than just reattach it.

314
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:26,222
Using the OR 2.0,
I believe that we can restore

315
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:29,184
a remarkable amount
of function and feeling.

316
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:30,935
So I can keep working construction?

317
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,270
Yeah.

318
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,521
I gotta be able to feel,

319
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:36,107
or I'm a liability
on a construction site.

320
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:37,776
Yeah, of course.

321
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:40,487
OK, so...

322
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:44,657
Well, 2.0's predictive modeling
estimated a...

323
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,160
85% likelihood of regaining some

324
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,372
or more sensation in the hand.

325
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:52,457
And that's after many, many months

326
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:56,002
of physical therapy and rehab.

327
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:58,254
Right, Dr. Marcel?

328
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,881
Maggie's correct.

329
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:02,092
Yeah, it's gonna be
a long road ahead, for sure.

330
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:05,470
And that's if you decide
to go with the surgery.

331
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,681
There's other options, of course.

332
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:11,393
There's been incredible
advancements in prosthetics.

333
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:14,312
And that's if this
banking thing doesn't work?

334
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:17,941
Then we can talk prosthetics.

335
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:20,568
But I want to give this a shot.

336
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:30,870
You've got this, Liza. Keep going.

337
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,498
Why isn't she coming?

338
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,083
Just do the C-section.

339
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,501
- It's too late for that.
- Please.

340
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:39,337
I know you're exhausted,
but you've got this, Liza.

341
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:40,672
So when I count to three, I need you

342
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:42,674
to give me everything you've got, OK?

343
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:44,009
This is it. Look at me.

344
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:47,116
One, two, three.

345
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:53,184
Yes! Yes!

346
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:55,729
You did it, Liza!

347
00:14:58,189 --> 00:14:59,566
Is she OK?

348
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:00,900
Yes.

349
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,323
Oh, hi.

350
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,868
Isn't she beautiful?

351
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:12,370
She's perfect.

352
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,456
I think she needs something.

353
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:16,750
Can you check her again?

354
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,793
No, she's fine.

355
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,045
It's OK.

356
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:22,547
Crying helps the fluid
get out of her lungs.

357
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:25,050
- But she won't stop.
- It's OK.

358
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,385
The longer she's on your chest,
the more she'll calm down.

359
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,220
Please, just take her.

360
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,348
- It's a really good idea...
- Please just take her!

361
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:33,767
OK.

362
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:37,944
Here we go. OK.

363
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:42,359
I'm sorry.

364
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:45,195
I'm just... I'm so tired.

365
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:48,448
Of course. You just ran a marathon.

366
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,533
OK. We'll get the baby up to the nursery

367
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:53,036
and let you sleep a bit, OK?

368
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:54,788
It's OK, baby girl.

369
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,337
Just rest, OK?

370
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:09,469
Got Isaac's CT back.

371
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,263
He's got a compression fracture at L2.

372
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:14,442
Well, that's unfortunate.

373
00:16:14,467 --> 00:16:17,552
But like you said, it won't
delay the transplant, right?

374
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:20,755
Well, take a look.
I could be wrong, but the bone

375
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,233
around the fracture has
a lytic appearance to me.

376
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:24,965
Do you think Isaac has cancer?

377
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,450
I think there's a possibility.

378
00:16:26,475 --> 00:16:28,905
Lytic lesions are commonly
associated with metastases.

379
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:31,491
And if the bone was
already damaged from cancer,

380
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,035
well, even a minor trauma
could cause a fracture.

381
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:36,287
OK, but you're not sure
that it's lytic, right?

382
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:37,747
There's still a chance it could just be

383
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,332
a traumatic compression fracture?

384
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,667
Which is why I want to get an MRI.

385
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:44,170
It'll show us if there are other lesions
and just give us a better idea

386
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,214
if it's traumatic or pathological.

387
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:50,301
And if it is pathological,
that means a biopsy.

388
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:54,139
And Isaac is definitely
not getting a kidney today.

389
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:55,515
No.

390
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,979
I wish Samantha was here, his wife.

391
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:02,313
Where is she?

392
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:05,775
On a flight to Seattle for their
granddaughter's first birthday.

393
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:09,696
Isaac got tired of both of them
missing out on milestones.

394
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:14,075
But one time she goes out
of town, he gets the call.

395
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:16,119
You mind delivering the news with me?

396
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,996
In her absence, I think a familiar face

397
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:20,248
might be comforting.

398
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:22,709
- Yeah, of course.
- All right.

399
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:27,505
- Hey.
- Hey.

400
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:29,174
You got a second?

401
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:30,383
Yep.

402
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,677
OK, um...

403
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:36,723
Is this operation really worth the risk?

404
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:39,976
If anything compromises blood
flow to the hand or the foot,

405
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:42,937
Rob could develop an infection
and become septic.

406
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:44,773
The 2.0 will be assessing blood flow

407
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:47,108
every step of the surgery
as well as predicting

408
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:49,944
if perfusion can be maintained post-op.

409
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:52,822
OK, clearly, you know
this technology inside and out,

410
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:56,117
but it's also never been used
for this type of procedure.

411
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:59,621
So what are you saying?

412
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:02,207
What, I oversold Rob?

413
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:06,336
No, but I think that you've
got a lot invested in 2.0,

414
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:08,838
and maybe you feel
a certain pressure to use it.

415
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10,632
I'm not gonna gamble
with a patient's life

416
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:12,592
just so I can show off
my shiny, new toy, Maggie.

417
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:13,802
Of course not.

418
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:15,720
- I'm just saying that...
- Crockett!

419
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,233
Here's the man I'm looking for.

420
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,016
Anything else?

421
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,979
I didn't mean
to chase Nurse Lockwood away.

422
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:27,649
No, she had to get back
to the ED. What's up?

423
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:30,151
Dr. Song briefed me
on the ectopic banking case.

424
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:31,486
- Very impressive.
- Yeah.

425
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:33,071
And my videographer's gonna film it.

426
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:35,240
We'll want to document it and
get as much press as possible.

427
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,575
Jack, I don't want anybody
in there taking pictures

428
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:39,494
while I'm in the middle
of a complex surgery.

429
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:41,996
You won't even know he's there.

430
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,420
I'll keep him out
of your way, I promise.

431
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,879
See you in the amphitheater?

432
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:52,799
- Yeah, right behind you.
- OK.

433
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:57,178
Hey.

434
00:18:57,178 --> 00:19:00,015
Hey. Hope you're not
in any kind of hurry.

435
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:02,350
Elevators taking their sweet time today.

436
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:06,062
I am fine. I'm not exactly
anxious to get where I'm going.

437
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,099
Meeting with a friend of Jack's

438
00:19:08,124 --> 00:19:10,942
whose seat on the board
is all but assured.

439
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:12,444
Oh, man, hospital politics.

440
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:13,945
- Yikes.
- Mm-hmm.

441
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,655
Speaking of which, what are you hearing

442
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,615
about what's going on
with the negotiations

443
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:19,242
with the custodial workers' union?

444
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:21,786
Liliana seems to think
they're getting all tense.

445
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:24,497
Between us, I don't foresee a strike.

446
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:25,874
- That's what I told her.
- Yeah.

447
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:29,627
A strike would wreak havoc
on the hospital system.

448
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:31,171
I gotta say, though,
it does make me wonder

449
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:33,131
why we can't give
our lowest paid employees,

450
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:35,258
I mean, even a 6% raise.

451
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:39,137
Well, it would be setting a precedent

452
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:42,640
that we can't afford to make
with the other unions, Daniel.

453
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,811
I mean, once we finish
with these negotiations,

454
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:50,523
we go into talks with the nurses' union.

455
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,942
And then, it's the plumbers' union.

456
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:57,155
I mean, you get the picture, right?

457
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:13,421
If I had just checked my blind spot,

458
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:16,633
we wouldn't be talking
about an MRI right now.

459
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:19,344
I'd be upstairs getting prepped
for surgery tonight, right?

460
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:23,431
- And that still might happen.
- Yeah, I'm sorry, Isaac.

461
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:27,268
I could not have predicted
the CT would reveal this.

462
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:29,354
Dr. Halstead,
I've waited five hellish years

463
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:32,023
for a kidney.

464
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:34,109
I've blown out so many veins,
they're running out

465
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:38,196
of access sites
to even deliver my dialysis.

466
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:40,740
If the fracture looks like
it's just from the accident...

467
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,534
Well, that's still a possibility, but...

468
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:44,911
Then that's good enough for me.

469
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:48,707
I'm not gonna fault you
for not running any more tests.

470
00:20:48,707 --> 00:20:52,752
And no one else will either.

471
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:55,880
Please, I'm begging you.

472
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:00,552
Hey. I thought
you delivered your patient.

473
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:01,720
I did, yes.

474
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,762
Well, why are you still up here?

475
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,764
We need an OB consult in the ED.

476
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,328
OK, I can head back down
with you right now.

477
00:21:06,353 --> 00:21:07,624
Just give me one sec to let Liza know.

478
00:21:07,649 --> 00:21:08,984
OK.

479
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:15,567
Oh, hey.

480
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:17,235
Where's Liza?

481
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:20,822
Yeah, she, uh...
She had to use the bathroom.

482
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:23,533
I'm Mike. I'm her boyfriend.

483
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:26,327
It's not safe for her
to use the restroom alone.

484
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:27,954
She seemed all right to me.

485
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:29,664
Hey, Liza, it's Hannah. Are you OK?

486
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:31,458
- Give her a minute, will you?
- Get your hands off of me.

487
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:32,625
Get your hands off me!

488
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,211
Hey, you heard her!

489
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:47,891
Liza.

490
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:58,318
Help me get her back into bed.

491
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:00,236
OK. Watch your neck.

492
00:22:00,525 --> 00:22:03,195
Support her head. Yeah, we got her.

493
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:10,640
You have no idea how hard
Liza worked to stay sober.

494
00:22:10,665 --> 00:22:12,140
- You have no idea.
- Well, I don't doubt that.

495
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:13,792
But we just found her
strung out on heroin.

496
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:15,335
She was overwhelmed and exhausted

497
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:18,338
after a grueling labor and had
a serious lapse of judgment,

498
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:20,215
but I know that
she could get back on track.

499
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:22,467
Hold it. Wait,
you're not actually suggesting

500
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:24,636
that we send a baby home
with that woman?

501
00:22:24,636 --> 00:22:26,012
No, of course not.

502
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:27,764
I want to find a sober
living situation for Liza,

503
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:29,766
a facility where she could
still receive treatment

504
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:30,934
while still caring for her baby.

505
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:32,686
You are swerving so far out your lane,

506
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:35,772
not to mention that you are
mandated to report this...

507
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:37,148
- No, not until...
- To, yes,

508
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:39,150
- the appropriate department.
- Not until I figure out

509
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,152
a way to keep Liza
and her baby together.

510
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:43,154
Then you let DCFS take care of it.

511
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:45,865
- They're far better equipped.
- What if they can't, huh?

512
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,158
Liza doesn't have family in the area.

513
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:48,493
Who's gonna take the baby?

514
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:52,163
Obviously, you care
a great deal about her.

515
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:54,374
Because I am her. I have been her.

516
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:57,210
And the only reason that
I'm standing here right now

517
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,838
is because people didn't give up on me.

518
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:02,549
So I am not giving up on Liza.

519
00:23:05,844 --> 00:23:07,846
You have till the end of the day.

520
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:09,222
OK.

521
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:19,983
Dr. Song, what's the recommendation
for anastomosis?

522
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:21,776
Any deviations from the plan?

523
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:26,577
End to end ulnar to posterior
tibial artery anastomosis.

524
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:29,451
OK. What's the venous drainage?

525
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:32,871
Anastomose the main dorsal
vein to the saphenous vein.

526
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:34,205
OK, great.

527
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:40,962
Whoever that belongs to,
turn it off right now.

528
00:23:40,962 --> 00:23:43,423
Sorry, that's me. It's my next meeting.

529
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:46,051
This is Jack Dayton. Great. Well...

530
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:48,053
Do you mind moving
to the right just a hair?

531
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:49,596
It'll give me a much cleaner shot.

532
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:52,015
No, that's where he needs to stand.

533
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:56,311
Let's keep noise down to a minimum
from here on out, folks.

534
00:23:56,311 --> 00:23:58,396
In terms of speed and efficiency,

535
00:23:58,396 --> 00:24:01,024
you're already performing above
and beyond 2.0's predictions.

536
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,776
We're on a good trajectory.

537
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:04,110
All right.

538
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:11,034
Let's say we forgo the MRI.
He gets the transplant.

539
00:24:11,034 --> 00:24:13,078
If it turns out he does have cancer,

540
00:24:13,078 --> 00:24:14,579
the immunosuppressants he'll be on

541
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:16,539
could interfere
with his cancer treatment.

542
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:19,584
And the treatment itself
could destroy his new kidney.

543
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:21,544
Valid concerns, yes.

544
00:24:21,544 --> 00:24:23,421
But a malignancy of any kind

545
00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:25,256
is a contraindication
for transplantation.

546
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:26,841
He'll be taken off the transplant list.

547
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:29,678
Right, which is...

548
00:24:29,678 --> 00:24:33,124
All the more reason
to look the other way?

549
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:39,437
I have an ethical and legal obligation
to disclose this finding.

550
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:41,481
I fail to do that,
it could compromise our status

551
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:43,024
as a high volume transplant center.

552
00:24:43,024 --> 00:24:46,361
I know it's a risk,

553
00:24:46,361 --> 00:24:48,238
but, Will,

554
00:24:48,238 --> 00:24:51,741
this could be
Isaac's only shot at a kidney.

555
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:53,952
I hear you. I know.

556
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:57,372
But it'd be irresponsible

557
00:24:57,372 --> 00:25:00,959
to let the transplant proceed
until we know more.

558
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:03,003
I'm sorry, Nellie.

559
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,971
What, did Jack steamroll you
into having lunch with me?

560
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:16,349
What? No. No, not at all.

561
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:19,310
Jack's a good friend,
but when he wants something,

562
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,354
he can be like a dog after a bone.

563
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:23,648
Yeah, well, that has
been my impression as well.

564
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:27,193
Yeah, but in his defense,
he's trying to do me a solid

565
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:31,114
'cause he knows how eager
I want to be a part of Med's board.

566
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:32,490
Well, I'm curious.

567
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:37,120
How did a former legislator
turned lobbyist become...

568
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,165
Girl, what did he do,
tell you about my whole side hustle?

569
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:41,583
Look.

570
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,138
That's what my daughter calls it.

571
00:25:43,163 --> 00:25:45,462
- Mm.
- Listen.

572
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:47,547
I'm not trying
to be a part of your board

573
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:50,508
so I can be a mouthpiece for
some special interest groups.

574
00:25:50,508 --> 00:25:53,470
So why do you want to be on the board?

575
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:56,806
To start with,

576
00:25:56,806 --> 00:25:59,059
I was born in this hospital.

577
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:02,187
- Get out. You're kidding.
- No, ma'am.

578
00:26:02,187 --> 00:26:04,898
I'ma be honest with you,
my very first broken arm

579
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:07,359
was fixed right within these walls.

580
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:10,570
So this is a homecoming of sorts?

581
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:15,437
Well, my ex-wife was
a professor at UW Milwaukee.

582
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:18,703
We raised the family there.

583
00:26:18,703 --> 00:26:22,207
But Chicago's home.

584
00:26:22,207 --> 00:26:25,085
And this hospital has always held

585
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:28,380
a very special place in my heart.

586
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:31,383
I'd love to be a part of its future.

587
00:26:31,383 --> 00:26:33,009
But I should warn you,

588
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:35,387
I'm not one of those board members

589
00:26:35,387 --> 00:26:38,223
that's only gonna show up
at special fancy parties,

590
00:26:38,223 --> 00:26:40,642
cut a check,
and is never heard from again.

591
00:26:40,642 --> 00:26:44,145
Yes, I know that type as well.

592
00:26:44,145 --> 00:26:46,439
I got a lot of time on my hands.

593
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:51,903
And I also have a lot of ideas.

594
00:26:51,903 --> 00:26:55,573
I'm all ears.

595
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,872
Oh, hey, Hannah. I'm glad I caught you.

596
00:27:02,872 --> 00:27:04,791
Would you mind pointing me
to one of your patients?

597
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:08,169
It's a Liza... sorry.

598
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:10,964
Um, I think that there's been a mix-up.

599
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:12,966
I didn't make a call to DCFS.

600
00:27:12,966 --> 00:27:14,426
Well, I actually wasn't told
who made the call,

601
00:27:14,426 --> 00:27:16,177
just that an eval was requested.

602
00:27:16,177 --> 00:27:17,929
Oh, well, that's definitely an error.

603
00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:19,639
Oh? OK.

604
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:21,141
I'm sorry you had to come down.

605
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:22,434
I'm the treating physician,

606
00:27:22,434 --> 00:27:24,477
and that patient
doesn't need an evaluation.

607
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:25,687
Uh, OK.

608
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:26,938
Well, in that case,

609
00:27:26,938 --> 00:27:28,940
I guess I'll just head back up
to my office.

610
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,191
Yeah.

611
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,365
What were
the patient's vitals on intake?

612
00:27:37,365 --> 00:27:38,867
Let me check.

613
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:40,452
Well, you should have this
on the tip of your tongue.

614
00:27:40,452 --> 00:27:42,746
Hey, I told you I was working on it.

615
00:27:42,746 --> 00:27:44,956
You had no right to make that call.

616
00:27:44,956 --> 00:27:46,557
Give us the room, please.

617
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:49,210
I'll check back later, yeah.

618
00:27:50,754 --> 00:27:53,798
OK, you do not dress me down ever,

619
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:55,633
and definitely
not in front of a resident.

620
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:59,304
I repeat, you had no right
to make that call.

621
00:27:59,304 --> 00:28:00,333
The hell are you talking about?

622
00:28:00,358 --> 00:28:02,015
You called DCFS on Liza.

623
00:28:02,015 --> 00:28:03,975
No, I did not.

624
00:28:03,975 --> 00:28:06,102
Hannah, I'm serious!

625
00:28:06,102 --> 00:28:07,729
Well, then who did?

626
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:18,823
OK. I'm gonna remove the clamp.

627
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:23,370
Nice and easy. OK.

628
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:26,998
Clamp out.

629
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:32,337
Yeah, the ulnar side's
showing some good perfusion.

630
00:28:32,337 --> 00:28:36,383
But yeah, there's not enough circulation
through the palmar arch.

631
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:38,885
And the radial side's
looking dusky to me.

632
00:28:38,885 --> 00:28:41,429
Could we hook in
the radial artery to something,

633
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:43,139
give it independent inflow?

634
00:28:43,139 --> 00:28:45,809
I'll have 2.0 run
through the iterations.

635
00:28:49,521 --> 00:28:51,481
It's assessing a number of variables.

636
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:53,149
It probably just needs a minute.

637
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:55,652
Not enough information.

638
00:28:55,652 --> 00:28:58,154
Confidence interval is too low.

639
00:28:58,154 --> 00:29:00,490
I think it just needs better
mapping of the radial artery

640
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:01,991
in the palmar arch.

641
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:04,494
Let me see if I can recalibrate imaging.

642
00:29:06,621 --> 00:29:08,123
Not enough information.

643
00:29:08,123 --> 00:29:11,626
Confidence interval is too low.

644
00:29:11,626 --> 00:29:14,045
Unfortunately, the
real-time data is insufficient.

645
00:29:14,045 --> 00:29:18,758
And the pre-op imaging is inadequate.

646
00:29:18,758 --> 00:29:21,344
What other artery am I gonna use
to plug into the radial?

647
00:29:21,344 --> 00:29:24,153
Without adequate blood flow,
the hand's not gonna survive.

648
00:29:24,178 --> 00:29:25,932
I'm afraid 2.0 doesn't have enough data

649
00:29:25,932 --> 00:29:27,183
to offer recommendation.

650
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:30,687
There's just not enough
published literature to draw from.

651
00:29:32,397 --> 00:29:34,899
So what am I supposed to do here?

652
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:38,903
Use your best critical judgment.

653
00:29:38,903 --> 00:29:41,364
Oh.

654
00:29:41,364 --> 00:29:44,784
Of course.

655
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:47,579
I'm not getting the MRI,

656
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:50,415
not till after the transplant.

657
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:52,459
How about that? I refuse.

658
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:55,003
Dr. Jones won't proceed with the surgery

659
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:56,880
until he sees the results of an MRI.

660
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,715
You had no right to tell him anything.

661
00:29:58,715 --> 00:30:01,718
Isaac, I had an ethical duty

662
00:30:01,718 --> 00:30:03,011
to notify your transplant surgeon...

663
00:30:03,011 --> 00:30:05,638
I should have just stuck to my story

664
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:07,599
and told you I felt fine.

665
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:09,270
Never should have mentioned any pain.

666
00:30:09,295 --> 00:30:11,227
Isaac, I know this is upsetting...

667
00:30:11,227 --> 00:30:14,230
Just do the damn MRI already!

668
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,858
Get me Dr. Jones!

669
00:30:16,858 --> 00:30:18,401
OK, he'll be here shortly.

670
00:30:18,401 --> 00:30:21,446
I'll put in the order.

671
00:30:30,455 --> 00:30:34,793
So you requested DCFS be called?

672
00:30:38,088 --> 00:30:39,923
Liza, why?

673
00:30:46,971 --> 00:30:50,684
When I held my little girl
for the first time,

674
00:30:50,684 --> 00:30:55,188
I could feel her depending on me,

675
00:30:55,188 --> 00:30:58,817
needing me for everything.

676
00:31:00,485 --> 00:31:02,112
I couldn't take it.

677
00:31:02,112 --> 00:31:04,489
I broke.

678
00:31:04,489 --> 00:31:06,908
Liza...

679
00:31:06,908 --> 00:31:10,662
These last few months have
been the hardest of my life.

680
00:31:10,662 --> 00:31:13,790
And it took everything in me
to stay sober,

681
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:18,712
but I did it for her.

682
00:31:18,712 --> 00:31:23,508
And now, I just...

683
00:31:23,508 --> 00:31:27,345
I can't muscle my way through this.

684
00:31:27,345 --> 00:31:30,849
OK, I've been there.

685
00:31:30,849 --> 00:31:33,643
Every time I got sober
for someone else...

686
00:31:33,643 --> 00:31:34,936
A family member, a partner...

687
00:31:34,936 --> 00:31:39,482
It lasted a year at the most.

688
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:43,820
Every time, I'd relapse.

689
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:47,782
It finally stuck
when I got sober for myself.

690
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:10,764
Care for dessert?

691
00:32:10,764 --> 00:32:12,474
Coffee or espresso?

692
00:32:12,474 --> 00:32:13,516
No, thanks.

693
00:32:13,516 --> 00:32:14,934
None for me. Thank you.

694
00:32:14,934 --> 00:32:18,813
Oh, my goodness. It's almost 3:00.

695
00:32:18,813 --> 00:32:22,400
I really hate to cut this off,
but unfortunately...

696
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,110
The place won't run itself.

697
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:27,530
Not yet, although Jack is working on it.

698
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:30,158
Yeah, I imagine he would be.

699
00:32:30,158 --> 00:32:33,495
Well, this has been quite
a productive conversation.

700
00:32:33,495 --> 00:32:38,291
Well, you know, we can always
continue the conversation.

701
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:41,294
Should you join the board? Thank you.

702
00:32:41,294 --> 00:32:43,630
Is that your more subtle way

703
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:46,216
of asking if I'm gonna
support your nomination?

704
00:32:46,216 --> 00:32:47,425
No, ma'am.

705
00:32:47,425 --> 00:32:50,553
That's my very unsubtle way
of asking you

706
00:32:50,553 --> 00:32:53,515
if you'll join me for drinks tonight.

707
00:32:53,515 --> 00:32:55,892
Oh.

708
00:32:55,892 --> 00:32:59,396
Well, that's a very tempting idea,

709
00:32:59,396 --> 00:33:03,566
but, um, I'm gonna have to...

710
00:33:03,566 --> 00:33:05,485
Politely decline.

711
00:33:05,485 --> 00:33:07,070
Politely.

712
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:10,865
Well, I appreciate you considering it.

713
00:33:10,865 --> 00:33:13,159
I hope the rest of your day
goes easy on you.

714
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:15,245
And the same for you, Dr. Thomas.

715
00:33:15,245 --> 00:33:18,081
Ah, ah. George.

716
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:19,708
Sharon.

717
00:33:30,051 --> 00:33:32,095
- You're back.
- I am.

718
00:33:32,095 --> 00:33:35,432
And I could use your expertise.

719
00:33:35,432 --> 00:33:36,599
Tell me.

720
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:38,768
How do you calm your nerves

721
00:33:38,768 --> 00:33:41,396
when your heart is beating very fast?

722
00:33:41,396 --> 00:33:44,733
Well, the first thing you do
is you sit down.

723
00:33:44,733 --> 00:33:48,778
And, um, just take
a couple deep breaths,

724
00:33:48,778 --> 00:33:51,990
and well, tell me what's going on.

725
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:54,868
I'm nervous because I'm going to speak

726
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:57,328
with a reporter from "Tribune" tomorrow.

727
00:33:57,328 --> 00:34:01,541
Our union boss, Mr. Wilson,
he's meeting me to prepare.

728
00:34:01,541 --> 00:34:04,002
Wow. How did that come about?

729
00:34:04,002 --> 00:34:06,463
You remember my friend
I was telling you about

730
00:34:06,463 --> 00:34:08,715
- from this morning?
- Yeah.

731
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:11,760
She's, uh, told Mr. Wilson about me.

732
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,054
And he asked me to go on record

733
00:34:14,054 --> 00:34:16,306
for a story the newspaper is writing

734
00:34:16,306 --> 00:34:20,143
about the negotiations,
what's at stake for us.

735
00:34:20,143 --> 00:34:22,062
I wonder if that's
really the best tactic

736
00:34:22,062 --> 00:34:23,605
for the union to take right now,

737
00:34:23,605 --> 00:34:27,442
to talk to the press while
negotiations are still ongoing.

738
00:34:27,442 --> 00:34:30,236
I mean, it could be seen
as a bad faith move.

739
00:34:30,236 --> 00:34:32,489
And honestly, Liliana,
I would be worried

740
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:35,367
about possible
personal repercussions for you.

741
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:37,535
Yeah, that's what I thought first too,

742
00:34:37,535 --> 00:34:39,371
that it would fan flames,

743
00:34:39,371 --> 00:34:41,498
- cause more harm than good.
- Exactly.

744
00:34:41,498 --> 00:34:45,001
But my friend, she tells me
Mr. Wilson tells her this:

745
00:34:45,001 --> 00:34:47,671
the hospital is flying in workers

746
00:34:47,671 --> 00:34:49,839
from all over to replace us.

747
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,341
They're flying in scabs?

748
00:34:51,341 --> 00:34:55,011
They're putting them
in hotels and everything.

749
00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:58,014
That's why I said I would go on record.

750
00:35:05,745 --> 00:35:07,666
- Hey, Sharon.
- Yeah?

751
00:35:07,691 --> 00:35:09,526
George has been blowing up my phone.

752
00:35:09,526 --> 00:35:12,028
He was eager before, but now he's ready

753
00:35:12,028 --> 00:35:13,860
to go to the mat for this board seat.

754
00:35:13,885 --> 00:35:16,700
Well, I will say he's
a very appealing candidate.

755
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,620
I still think Gloria Jeffers
would make an exceptional board member,

756
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:25,000
but I'm glad you brought
Dr. Thomas to my attention.

757
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,002
So you'll support his candidacy?

758
00:35:27,002 --> 00:35:29,879
- I won't challenge it.
- Mm.

759
00:35:29,879 --> 00:35:33,008
You know, not to gloat,
but, um, I told you, didn't I?

760
00:35:33,373 --> 00:35:35,375
Sounds like gloating to me.

761
00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:46,730
Sharon, hospital's negotiating
with scare tactics now?

762
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,189
- They're flying in scabs?
- Yeah.

763
00:35:48,189 --> 00:35:52,694
I don't like it either,
but it's also a necessary precaution.

764
00:35:52,694 --> 00:35:55,030
Did you know about this when
we were talking this morning?

765
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:57,699
I mean, I thought you told me
that the negotiation was going well.

766
00:35:57,699 --> 00:36:01,077
No, what I said was
that I didn't foresee a strike.

767
00:36:01,077 --> 00:36:03,663
But look, we still have to be prepared

768
00:36:03,663 --> 00:36:06,207
for the possibility
of a work stoppage, Daniel.

769
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:10,128
I mean, anything less is negligence.

770
00:36:10,128 --> 00:36:11,379
What I'd say to the board is I'd say,

771
00:36:11,379 --> 00:36:14,049
look, isn't a 6% bump for a custodian

772
00:36:14,049 --> 00:36:15,703
a fraction of what it would be
for a nurses?

773
00:36:15,728 --> 00:36:18,553
Daniel, I don't ever tell you
how to do your job.

774
00:36:18,553 --> 00:36:20,055
And I'm not telling you how to do yours.

775
00:36:20,055 --> 00:36:21,264
I'm telling you people are scared

776
00:36:21,264 --> 00:36:22,571
'cause they can't afford
to miss a paycheck.

777
00:36:22,596 --> 00:36:24,517
Yeah, and that's the last thing I want.

778
00:36:24,517 --> 00:36:26,978
That's why I'm trying
to do everything in my power

779
00:36:26,978 --> 00:36:29,230
to avert a strike.

780
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,399
I can't give you all of the details.

781
00:36:31,399 --> 00:36:36,031
I expect you, of all people,
to trust that.

782
00:36:43,578 --> 00:36:45,288
Get the MRI back?

783
00:36:45,288 --> 00:36:49,561
Yes, and it showed evidence
of a pathological fracture.

784
00:36:50,877 --> 00:36:52,587
When are they doing the biopsy?

785
00:36:52,587 --> 00:36:55,590
Tomorrow morning,
but Dr. Jones ordered an SPEP

786
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,592
and a UPEP after he saw the MRI,

787
00:36:57,592 --> 00:36:59,594
and both blood tests came back positive.

788
00:37:01,805 --> 00:37:03,098
Multiple myeloma.

789
00:37:03,098 --> 00:37:06,184
In all likelihood, yes.

790
00:37:06,184 --> 00:37:07,852
Isaac hasn't been told yet.

791
00:37:07,852 --> 00:37:09,396
Dr. Jones wanted to wait

792
00:37:09,396 --> 00:37:12,732
until it was confirmed by the biopsy.

793
00:37:12,732 --> 00:37:17,278
Just this morning, Isaac
thought his luck was changing,

794
00:37:17,278 --> 00:37:18,738
he was finally getting a new kidney.

795
00:37:18,738 --> 00:37:20,115
And now,

796
00:37:20,115 --> 00:37:24,035
he's potentially facing
a terminal cancer.

797
00:37:24,035 --> 00:37:27,706
Or maybe not.

798
00:37:27,706 --> 00:37:32,502
Maybe, thanks to your
diligence, we caught it early.

799
00:37:32,502 --> 00:37:35,296
Maybe that MRI just saved his life.

800
00:37:40,593 --> 00:37:43,263
- Hey.
- I spoke to Dr. Song.

801
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:44,931
She said the surgery went well

802
00:37:44,931 --> 00:37:48,601
and Rob's hand has excellent
blood flow and venous return.

803
00:37:48,601 --> 00:37:51,187
Yeah, things are looking all right.

804
00:37:54,274 --> 00:37:56,192
I had a moment in there.

805
00:37:58,611 --> 00:38:02,240
It's like I didn't know
how to trust my own judgment,

806
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,868
mostly 'cause I haven't
needed to in some time.

807
00:38:04,868 --> 00:38:07,829
I'd just ask 2.0.

808
00:38:07,829 --> 00:38:12,751
That's the price we pay
for ease and convenience.

809
00:38:14,836 --> 00:38:17,714
I suppose.

810
00:38:26,723 --> 00:38:28,475
Marilyn has been fostering newborns

811
00:38:28,475 --> 00:38:31,353
for over five years,
ever since she retired.

812
00:38:31,353 --> 00:38:34,147
So you have a lot of experience then?

813
00:38:34,147 --> 00:38:36,566
I do.

814
00:38:36,566 --> 00:38:38,693
And, Liza, like we talked about,

815
00:38:38,693 --> 00:38:40,820
the goal is reunification, always,

816
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:43,698
so soon as you finish
the treatment program,

817
00:38:43,698 --> 00:38:45,950
we'll reassess things.

818
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:47,702
All right.

819
00:38:47,702 --> 00:38:50,038
OK.

820
00:38:50,038 --> 00:38:52,123
Do you have a name picked out?

821
00:38:52,123 --> 00:38:56,711
Yeah, it's Hannah.

822
00:39:12,936 --> 00:39:15,647
Hey, Dr. Song.

823
00:39:15,647 --> 00:39:16,981
Glad I caught you.

824
00:39:16,981 --> 00:39:18,733
I wanted to let you know
you can sleep in tomorrow.

825
00:39:18,733 --> 00:39:20,276
What happened to the exploratory lab

826
00:39:20,276 --> 00:39:21,731
we had scheduled for 8:00 a.m.?

827
00:39:21,756 --> 00:39:24,406
Yeah, it's still on the docket.
I just moved it to a normal OR.

828
00:39:24,406 --> 00:39:25,615
If this is about what happened today...

829
00:39:25,615 --> 00:39:26,950
It's not. I mean, it is,

830
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:29,119
but not because
I lost any confidence in 2.0.

831
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:30,662
OK.

832
00:39:32,747 --> 00:39:34,791
You ever turn off the GPS
while you're driving

833
00:39:34,791 --> 00:39:36,638
just to see if you still know the roads?

834
00:39:36,663 --> 00:39:38,712
No, never.

835
00:39:38,712 --> 00:39:40,463
Fair enough.

836
00:39:40,463 --> 00:39:44,842
Me, I need to do that from time to time.

837
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:47,345
For my own confidence.

838
00:39:47,345 --> 00:39:48,763
If you change your mind,

839
00:39:48,763 --> 00:39:51,975
it takes a double shot
of espresso, and I am up.

840
00:39:51,975 --> 00:39:54,561
Good to know.

841
00:39:54,561 --> 00:39:56,479
- Good night.
- Good night.

842
00:40:02,402 --> 00:40:03,987
Daniel, wait.

843
00:40:03,987 --> 00:40:05,947
Oh, no. Oh, no.

844
00:40:05,947 --> 00:40:08,074
No, I didn't want to interrupt.

845
00:40:08,074 --> 00:40:11,369
No. No, no, no, it's OK.
Good you're here, actually.

846
00:40:11,369 --> 00:40:13,663
How's the... How's the prep going?

847
00:40:13,663 --> 00:40:15,790
OK, I think.

848
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:18,710
Mr. Wilson was asking if
I know any doctors at hospital

849
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:20,837
who would be willing to speak out.

850
00:40:20,837 --> 00:40:22,797
How do you mean?

851
00:40:22,797 --> 00:40:25,050
For newspaper article.

852
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:28,762
Talk to reporters, share why
you support us, our demands.

853
00:40:30,555 --> 00:40:33,391
Because for me, that would be a
violation of my employment contract.

854
00:40:33,391 --> 00:40:35,060
I'm not allowed to...

855
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:38,355
To speak the media without
talking to the hospital first.

856
00:40:38,355 --> 00:40:41,483
Mr. Wilson said
you don't have to go on record.

857
00:40:41,483 --> 00:40:43,485
Um, you would just...

858
00:40:43,485 --> 00:40:45,278
We'd just say your department.

859
00:40:45,278 --> 00:40:47,155
No names.

860
00:40:47,155 --> 00:40:48,406
Liliana, I would love to help,

861
00:40:48,406 --> 00:40:50,325
but I mean, I just think
that people would...

862
00:40:50,325 --> 00:40:53,203
You know, they'd connect
the dots pretty quickly.

863
00:40:53,203 --> 00:40:56,081
Don't you think?

864
00:40:56,081 --> 00:40:58,625
I understand. It's OK.

865
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:00,460
Really?

866
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,045
You know how much I support you.

867
00:41:02,045 --> 00:41:03,880
You don't have to explain.

868
00:41:06,007 --> 00:41:08,176
I'll, uh, call you later?

869
00:41:08,176 --> 00:41:10,512
Sure. OK.
