1
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,155
Previously on E.R.

2
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,630
Did you work on Edgar Dixon today?

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,535
Yeah,yeah,yeah. Um,why? What's up?

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,610
First Mission Baptist is dispensing
meds without a pharmacy license.

5
00:00:13,645 --> 00:00:15,420
It's a felony,Pratt. A man died.

6
00:00:15,455 --> 00:00:16,720
Thank you for the hot dog.

7
00:00:16,755 --> 00:00:17,920
It's my pleasure.

8
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:19,755
I'll catch you later,Joe.

9
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:21,145
So,how long you staying,Gracie?

10
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,050
Just till you   row me out,not a bit
longer.

11
00:00:23,085 --> 00:00:24,332
Luka,this is...

12
00:00:24,367 --> 00:00:25,580
- Eddie. - Eddie.

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,830
Nobody called you a whore.

14
00:00:28,865 --> 00:00:29,585
My mom did.

15
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:30,715
Your mom's mistaken.

16
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,400
I'm gonna find budget cuts somewhere
else.

17
00:00:32,435 --> 00:00:33,590
There is no way we're losing.

18
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,580
Thanks,but I resign.

19
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,075
<i>"A HOUSE DIVDEDE" This is Dr. Abby
Lockhart.</i>

20
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,540
<i>I'm calling from County General, and
ca  you te   him</i>

21
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:42,965
I   t   s la  result

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,710
and he needs to come in   and discuss
them?

23
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,080
Th  ks.

24
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,730
Since when do   u call E.R. patients
from home?

25
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,080
I was worried about th   guy.

26
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,735
I want to ma   sure he gets seen.

27
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,638
Isn't that more of a job for his
imar  care physician?

28
00:00:57,885 --> 00:00:59,135
He doesn't have one.

29
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:02,289
Well,no incentive to get  ne if you'r
gonna make h  se  alls.

30
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:09,360
I phoned his hotel to make sure he
comes    for follow-up.

31
00:01:09,395 --> 00:01:10,740
Hotel?

32
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,835
Yes,he's from out of town.

33
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,610
- Who is this guy? - It's Eddie
Jackson. You met hi

34
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,460
What?

35
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:19,675
Nothing.

36
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,245
Well,why are you acting weird?

37
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,823
Hmm,I just... I j  t think   it's a lit
e strange

38
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,523
the amount of   rsonal attention
u seem to be giving some guy

39
00:01:26,815 --> 00:01:29,040
you met in a b  .

40
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,966
<i>   You di  't talk to her,di
you?</i>

41
00:01:31,035 --> 00:01:33,170
I didn't  ee her.

42
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,735
I thought you were gonna talk to her
last night.

43
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:40,306
Yeah,but   got home so lat  and she was
excited about how well

44
00:01:40,455 --> 00:01:42,540
she did on her history
presentation,so...

45
00:01:42,575 --> 00:01:43,115
Tony...

46
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,150
I'm gonn  do it. I'm gonna do it.

47
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,100
You've  een saying that for   week.

48
00:01:48,135 --> 00:01:50,420
She needs to hear this from you.

49
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,905
She needs to know that it was your
idea,

50
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,860
otherwise,   she'll never forgive me.

51
00:01:54,895 --> 00:01:56,870
I right,I'll tell her.

52
00:01:56,905 --> 00:01:58,810
Tonight,I promise.

53
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,365
<i>Oh,man,would you     look at this
board?</i>

54
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,680
We got cough,cough and vomiting,itchy
feet,diarrhea, diar  ea and vomitin

55
00:02:09,715 --> 00:02:11,682
I haven't seen a decent trauma my last
three shifts.

56
00:02:11,717 --> 00:02:13,615
People are getting too damned careful
these days.

57
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,250
Chop  r's bringing in some kind of
snowmobile accident.

58
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,980
Ca  ed it.

59
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,535
- Is this the snowmobile? - Yeah,one of
'em.

60
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:33,670
Clar   Sutton,13,lost control and hit a
fence.

61
00:02:33,705 --> 00:02:35,387
It was an accident.

62
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:37,070
I was trying to turn.

63
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,525
Where's Dennis?

64
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,170
McKay's unloading the older brother.

65
00:02:40,205 --> 00:02:41,745
I think this one got the wo  t of it.

66
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,200
His brother carried him almost a mile
to get help.

67
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,820
Can I be in the same room with Dennis?

68
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,805
It hurts to breathe.

69
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,700
Okay,try   t to talk. Gates,  hy don't
you go up to the roof,

70
00:02:50,735 --> 00:02:51,775
grab the next one? I'll take this.

71
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:52,545
- No,I got this covered. - Nah,I got
this one.

72
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,790
Nah,I got this one. who knows how to
treat him,all ri  t?

73
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,957
This kid needs treatment, Okay?

74
00:02:55,957 --> 00:02:57,330
And that'd be me. I'll call you if I
need you.

75
00:02:57,365 --> 00:02:58,687
Okay,guys,knock it off Come on.

76
00:02:58,722 --> 00:02:59,975
Okay,who gets this patient?

77
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,510
Me,if you're gonna act like babies then
that's how I'll treat  ou.

78
00:03:02,545 --> 00:03:03,615
Luka,sats are dropping

79
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,230
Okay,bag him. Abby,run ahead and
intubate.

80
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,305
Way to go.

81
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,305
This was your fault.

82
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,775
- Yeah,right. - Yeah,I am right.

83
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,910
- Don't be an idiot. - Ass for brains.

84
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,675
Edgar never liked to talk about his
troubles.

85
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:18,500
In fact,the only thing he ever talked
about was football.

86
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,665
*****

87
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,475
But I remember... one Sunday Edgar
looked troubled,

88
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:27,020
and I said to him "Well,is there
anything I could do for you?"

89
00:03:27,055 --> 00:03:29,897
So he said,"No,no,Pastor,you can't help
my problem. "

90
00:03:29,932 --> 00:03:32,740
I said,  ell,maybe I can't,but I know
someone who can.

91
00:03:32,775 --> 00:03:34,420
You know,God always listens. "

92
00:03:34,455 --> 00:03:36,040
Oh,amen.

93
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,345
Dr. Pratt.

94
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,550
Pastor,that was a nice service.

95
00:03:41,585 --> 00:03:43,550
- Thank you. - Very nice.

96
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:50,950
Um,Mrs. Dixon, I just w    d to pass on
my condolences once again.

97
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,245
I just,  ,

98
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,650
want to let you know if there's
anything,

99
00:03:55,685 --> 00:03:57,735
anything I can do,

100
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,720
please don't hesitate to call the
hospital.

101
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,220
Thank you,Dr. Pratt.

102
00:04:04,255 --> 00:04:06,270
Thank you.

103
00:04:13,935 --> 00:04:16,590
ER Season 13 Episode 13

104
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,550
Greg!

105
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,670
The Medical Board called me.

106
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,295
I bet they did.

107
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,570
They said that they're issuing a letter
for us to cease and desist our drug
program.

108
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,870
at's not a surprise.

109
00:04:30,905 --> 00:04:32,700
I told 'em to go to hell.

110
00:04:32,735 --> 00:04:33,765
You did what?

111
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,285
They don't understand what we're doing.

112
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,110
Yeah,but I'm sure they got a pretty
clear idea now.

113
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,555
Look,I like what you're doing,but it
doesn't work.

114
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,790
People need a continuity of care and
the church clinic isn't open every day.

115
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,990
How many people do you think we've
helped since we started this program?

116
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,290
I'm sorry.

117
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,170
Well,we're not giving up on the
program.

118
00:04:52,205 --> 00:04:53,395
Then you're headed for trouble.

119
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,740
My people have now  re else to turn to.

120
00:04:55,775 --> 00:04:57,740
They're already in trouble.

121
00:04:58,410 --> 00:04:59,880
I'm out.

122
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,525
Sats are drifting into the 70s.

123
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,835
Come on,Clarke,stay with us.

124
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,110
- Want me to do that? - No.

125
00:05:10,145 --> 00:05:11,245
- You sure? - Yeah.

126
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,630
If you want to help,you can give me
some cricoid.

127
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,240
I got blood here. What do you want?

128
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,750
Uh,CBC,LFTs,chem7...

129
00:05:16,785 --> 00:05:17,985
I'm in. Bag him.

130
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:18,965
...UA and a blood gas.

131
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,130
You're probably not gonna need that.

132
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,470
Decreased on the left. Pull back the ET
tube.

133
00:05:27,505 --> 00:05:28,715
No,I stopped just past the cords.

134
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,130
Well,it's obviously not,so pull it
back.

135
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:32,900
I'm gonna call the Blood Bank.

136
00:05:32,935 --> 00:05:34,770
Uh,good idea.

137
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,740
Still decreased. Sterile sixes and a
chest tube tray.

138
00:05:39,775 --> 00:05:42,080
Hold on. Let's not  ump the gun.

139
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,650
He's got a bruise   d bad sats. I'm not
jumping the gun.

140
00:05:44,685 --> 00:05:45,655
It's a pneumothorax.

141
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,310
Right,I'll call for a portable chest.

142
00:05:47,345 --> 00:05:48,195
Good,good.

143
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,515
Let's see what we're dealing with here
first.

144
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,820
20% of all pneumothoraces are missed on
X ray. You taught me that.

145
00:05:52,855 --> 00:05:54,245
Nice to know you were listening.

146
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,180
We have time to wait for the film
before we start cutting.

147
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,040
What about the sliding lung sign?

148
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,110
Okay,lungs are up. No hemothorax or rib
fractures.

149
00:06:04,145 --> 00:06:06,362
What's happening with Clarke? Why isn't
he sitting u

150
00:06:06,397 --> 00:06:08,580
They put a tube down his throat to help
him breathe.

151
00:06:08,615 --> 00:06:10,200
Good bowel sounds.

152
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,670
He got the wind knocked out of him. I
had to carry him to the road.

153
00:06:13,705 --> 00:06:14,795
It's a good thing you did.

154
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:17,440
Crits 38,pressure's still good; 122/76.

155
00:06:17,475 --> 00:06:19,125
Let me know if anything's sore.

156
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,942
He kept begging me to let him drive
His father's gonna kill me.

157
00:06:22,065 --> 00:06:24,180
Wait. I thought you two were brothers.

158
00:06:24,215 --> 00:06:26,115
He's my stepbrother.

159
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,580
My dad died when I was little. My mom
remarried in August.

160
00:06:29,615 --> 00:06:31,950
He thinks I'm a screw-up. This i  't
going to help.

161
00:06:31,985 --> 00:06:33,380
Pretty much wrecked his snowmobile. Ow!

162
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,935
All right,left lower quadrant. Call
Surgery.

163
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:38,580
Not so fast. It's not a contusion. It's
an abrasion.

164
00:06:38,615 --> 00:06:40,240
He's guarding.

165
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:43,765
Do you have to keep doing that?

166
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,965
I'm sorry. He's hemodynamically
stable,and his crit's good.

167
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,540
Let's get a CT of his belly,and if it's
normal, then we won't have to waste a
surgeon's time.

168
00:06:50,575 --> 00:06:52,340
Well,I'm going to have to disagree with
your assessment.

169
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,245
Ah,okay.

170
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,550
Let's run it by Kovac.

171
00:06:55,585 --> 00:06:57,630
Let's not.

172
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,700
I decide when we present to an
attending.

173
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,765
No lung sliding.

174
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,305
What the hell is lung sliding anyway?

175
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,695
Normally there's lung movement on
ultrasound.

176
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,110
If i  s not there,then the lung must be
partially deflated.

177
00:07:10,145 --> 00:07:11,795
Showoff.

178
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,360
Okay,chest tube tray to Abby.

179
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,270
What? You don't want to do it now?

180
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:20,250
I wanted to do it 15 minutes ago.

181
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,890
Well,it looks like Abby was right and
Luka confirmed the diagnosis
radiographically.

182
00:07:30,925 --> 00:07:32,750
Good work,team.

183
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,050
What the hell do I have to do to get
someone to come down here?

184
00:07:37,085 --> 00:07:39,980
Dr. Gates from the E.R. That's with an
"E"   for "emergency. "

185
00:07:40,015 --> 00:07:41,295
You called for a consult?

186
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,060
Actually,I dialed the Hot Surgeons chat
line.

187
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:44,535
Which room?

188
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,925
What's the matter? No,"Hey,how you
doing?

189
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,640
You look sexy in that white suit"?
Hey,what's wrong?

190
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:52,550
You mean besides the fact the last time
I saw youthe woman that you liv  with
practically assaulted me

191
00:07:52,585 --> 00:07:54,520
and her daughter called me a whore?

192
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:56,835
I told you I was sorry.

193
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:00,400
I don't live with her anymore.Not for
long,anyway.

194
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,000
How's Sarah?

195
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,325
We're working through it.

196
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,050
No blood out. It's not the
chest.Xeroform and the thoroseal.

197
00:08:08,085 --> 00:08:09,435
Could be cardiac contusion.

198
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:12,480
Get a 12-lead and hold off on the
blooduntil the troponin's back.

199
00:08:12,515 --> 00:08:13,737
CT's ready.I'll take him up.

200
00:08:13,772 --> 00:08:14,960
- I'll take him.- You sure?

201
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,850
Yeah,in case he crashes.

202
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:27,425
Well,that wasn't awkward.

203
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,630
Further proof workplace romance,bad
idea.

204
00:08:30,665 --> 00:08:31,717
Is that so?

205
00:08:31,752 --> 00:08:32,735
Uh,yeah.

206
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:36,210
Hey,look,the other night you
kindacaught me off guard with that
kiss,

207
00:08:36,245 --> 00:08:39,170
and I don't... I have a ruleagainst
dating people at work.

208
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,205
You do?

209
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,850
Yeah,it's kind of a new rule.

210
00:08:42,885 --> 00:08:44,185
Uh,yeah.

211
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,295
But a solid rule.

212
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,370
That's cool,really.

213
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,980
This is Dennis' father,Gary.Gary,this
is Dr. Gates

214
00:08:56,015 --> 00:08:57,137
and Dr. Rasgotra.

215
00:08:57,172 --> 00:08:58,225
Where's Clarke?

216
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,010
Oh,upstairs for more X rays.

217
00:09:00,045 --> 00:09:01,697
Is this a social visit?

218
00:09:01,732 --> 00:09:03,351
Tony asked for a consult.

219
00:09:03,386 --> 00:09:04,935
I hope you're happy now.

220
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,435
I'm sorry. We were being really
careful.

221
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:11,070
You obviously weren't being carefulif
you put Clarke in the hospital.

222
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,580
I want to see my son.

223
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,280
Where is he?!

224
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,955
Uh,Lily,could you?

225
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,280
I can take you to him,sir.

226
00:09:18,315 --> 00:09:19,635
Thank you.

227
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,890
You better pray he's all right.

228
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:31,250
Uh,Neela,I'm sorry youhad to come down
here.

229
00:09:31,285 --> 00:09:33,475
Um,he doesn't need a co  ult.

230
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,760
Oh,well,I'm here nowand I'm almost
finished.

231
00:09:35,795 --> 00:09:39,285
Okay,fine,then can you explain to him
why

232
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,785
Actually,I'm suggesting weadmit him for
observation.

233
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,750
Why? His kidneys look good.His liver
and spleen appear to be normal.

234
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:46,335
Did I miss something on the CT?

235
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:49,210
Well,an occult injurycould take time to
declare itself.

236
00:09:49,245 --> 00:09:50,875
- He's right.- No,he's not.

237
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,735
The surgeon concurs with my assessment.

238
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:55,910
Hey,don't worry,boss.I'm not one of
those "I told you so" kids.

239
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,430
Can I speak to you outside?

240
00:09:57,465 --> 00:09:58,940
- Certainly.- Okay.

241
00:09:58,975 --> 00:10:00,500
Not you.

242
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,220
Sammy.

243
00:10:02,255 --> 00:10:03,600
Hi,guys.

244
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,245
Ben,hello.

245
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,830
Hey,Gracie. What's up,Alex?

246
00:10:06,865 --> 00:10:07,990
Hey.

247
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,900
Alex is signing up for theVolunteen
program today.

248
00:10:10,935 --> 00:10:12,835
He's real excited about it.

249
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,850
I had to practicallydrag him here by
his ears.

250
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,615
Alex,even if you volunteerfor a couple
hours a week,

251
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,970
it'll still help on yourcollege
applications,okay?

252
00:10:21,005 --> 00:10:22,215
And maybe you'll even like it.

253
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,175
Just keep telling yourself that,Mom.

254
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,310
When I was your age,I had two jobs.

255
00:10:26,345 --> 00:10:28,410
Yeah,doing what,milking the T-Rex?

256
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,730
I worked on the Milfords'farm before
school,smartass,

257
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:33,605
and at night I worked in Addison's
Bakery.

258
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,180
If you'd like,I could take Alex to
thevolunteer center,show him around a
bit.

259
00:10:36,215 --> 00:10:37,585
That's great. Thank you,Ben.

260
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,405
Well,actually,I probably know this
hospitalbetter than you do.

261
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,230
That's great. Then you can give me the
tour'cause I still can't find the gift
shop. Come on.

262
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,240
He gets cuter every time I see him.

263
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,355
Ben.

264
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,050
I heard you.

265
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,685
You should be going after that one.

266
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,840
It's a little tricky datingsomeone you
work with.

267
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:01,655
What's tricky about it?

268
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,440
Having sex without getting caught?

269
00:11:03,475 --> 00:11:04,925
- Gracie...- Look,honey,

270
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,860
I know what your life has been like.

271
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:11,190
Trust me,Sammy,I know.

272
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,830
All the women in our family are the
same-

273
00:11:14,865 --> 00:11:18,210
very fertile,allergic to chestnuts,

274
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:20,802
prone to bladder infections...

275
00:11:20,837 --> 00:11:23,360
And we all have that damn gene

276
00:11:23,395 --> 00:11:25,250
that predi  oses us

277
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,130
to bad boys.

278
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,465
Chestnuts?

279
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,200
Sammy,life is short.

280
00:11:30,235 --> 00:11:31,972
You deserve to be happy.

281
00:11:32,007 --> 00:11:33,675
You deserve a good man.

282
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:37,110
If you like this guy,go for it.

283
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:41,570
Okay,the least you can do is give mean
honest and professional opinion.

284
00:11:41,605 --> 00:11:42,845
- I did.- No,you didn't.

285
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,260
Well,how would you know?You're not a
surgeon.

286
00:11:44,295 --> 00:11:45,820
Neither are you.

287
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,175
Sorry. Sorry,look...

288
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,320
- No,you look. I came down,I
assessed...- We established... You
shouldn't have come down...

289
00:11:51,355 --> 00:11:52,395
- I made a professional call. If- you
disagree with my opinion...

290
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,580
- ... it's personal,just like your
visit.- ... fine,tha  s your
prerogative.

291
00:11:54,615 --> 00:11:56,612
- What you can't do... The reason- why
you're siding with Gates

292
00:11:56,647 --> 00:11:58,610
- is because you're screwing him.- ...
is accuse me of being...

293
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,310
I can't believe you just said that.

294
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,625
So it's true?

295
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,595
No. And even if it were,it'snone of
your damn business.

296
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,530
And it certainly hasnothing to do with
this case.

297
00:12:06,565 --> 00:12:08,800
It does if it's clouding your judgment.

298
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,090
Hey,maybe we should get anattending to
weigh in on this.

299
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,745
- No.- No.

300
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,015
Hey,hey,hey,hey,hey.

301
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,420
Somebody want to tell mewhat the hell's
goin  on here?

302
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:19,245
Oh,so everything's just all good
now,huh?

303
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,860
Well,somebody better havea good
explanation. Ray?

304
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:25,740
Okay. 13-year-old drovea snowmobile
into a fence.

305
00:12:25,775 --> 00:12:27,762
Normal CT,stable crit and B.P.

306
00:12:27,797 --> 00:12:29,715
Gates wanted a surgical consult,

307
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,830
I said we didn't need one, but
hedecided to call Neela down here
anyway.

308
00:12:32,865 --> 00:12:34,235
Better safe than sorry,right?

309
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,250
Wrong.It wasn't your call to make.

310
00:12:36,285 --> 00:12:37,165
Ray's above you.

311
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,870
Now if you have a problem with
yourresident or you disagree with his
judgment,

312
00:12:39,905 --> 00:12:41,217
then you call an attending.

313
00:12:41,252 --> 00:12:42,495
I wanted to present to Kovac.

314
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:45,010
And I didn't.He was busy with another
trauma anyway.

315
00:12:45,045 --> 00:12:47,490
And now they've taken thehospital's
last surgical bed.

316
00:12:47,525 --> 00:12:49,160
That kid needs 24-hour observation.

317
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,250
You cannot give up the last surgical
bed.

318
00:12:51,285 --> 00:12:52,585
I need to follow serial exams.

319
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,295
- Then do it down -here.- You're
already full up.

320
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:56,320
Th   send him home and have him come
backin 12 hours for a re-exam.

321
00:12:56,355 --> 00:12:57,375
Exactly.

322
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,065
You know,I'm trying to help you guys
here.

323
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,000
No,you give up your last surgical bedto
this kid and we can get stuck boarding

324
00:13:02,035 --> 00:13:04,190
a real surgical trainwreck down here
for days.

325
00:13:04,225 --> 00:13:05,475
Ray's patient,Ray's call.

326
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:08,190
Fine. Keep him down here.Less w  k for
me.

327
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,315
Thank you.

328
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,355
Yeah,you better be right.

329
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,740
Thanks for the vote of confidence,boss.

330
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,735
- Luka.- Yeah.

331
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:20,390
You get a chance to speak withAngela
Gilliam about Edgar Dixon?

332
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:21,345
Who?

333
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,605
The guy from the church clinic.

334
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,880
Oh,ye  ,she-she said she'd,uh,look into
it.

335
00:13:25,915 --> 00:13:27,605
All right,I'm just a little concerned.

336
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,840
Someone called the medical boardand
they called the church.

337
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,380
Okay,I'll talk to her again.

338
00:13:31,415 --> 00:13:32,930
All right,thanks.

339
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,310
You looking for something?

340
00:13:39,345 --> 00:13:40,592
A patient.

341
00:13:40,627 --> 00:13:41,840
Which one?

342
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,360
Hockey dad,Jim Singer,30.Hockey puck
versus face.

343
00:13:46,395 --> 00:13:47,695
It was a slap shot.

344
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,255
This is his son,Jimmy,Jr.

345
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:50,745
God,he spit out his teeth.

346
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:53,220
Okay,Jimmy,we're gonna fix your dad up

347
00:13:53,255 --> 00:13:54,940
and you get to play X- Box,okay?

348
00:13:54,975 --> 00:13:56,790
Margo,can you take Jimmy?

349
00:13:56,825 --> 00:13:57,737
How you doing,sir?

350
00:13:57,772 --> 00:13:58,615
I can't breathe.

351
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:01,660
Looks like a fractured jaw,
multiplebroken teeth. His pulse ox is
down to 88.

352
00:14:01,695 --> 00:14:04,270
Okay,he needs an airway.Pratt,you want
a piece of this?

353
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,870
sure.

354
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,760
How come they didn't bring Clarke back?

355
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,440
They probably moved him to another
bedto free up the trauma room.

356
00:14:24,475 --> 00:14:26,480
And that can be a good sign,so...

357
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,240
Your stepfather hasn't come by,huh?

358
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,420
No.

359
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,100
Why didn't you  ell him youweren't the
one who was driving?

360
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:40,380
What's the point?

361
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,685
I don't know,maybe so that...

362
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,820
he knows you didn't do this.

363
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,660
He'd still find a way to blame me.

364
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:51,440
At least now he can't get mad at
Clarke,too.

365
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,760
You   o are close?

366
00:14:54,795 --> 00:14:57,365
Yeah,I guess.

367
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,090
First,it was kind of wedhaving a little
brother.

368
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,990
But he's cool.

369
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,680
His dad's really stric   on him.

370
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:13,348
I'm afraid he thinksthat I'm a b
influence.

371
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,840
Sometimes I let   m dothings his father
doesn't.

372
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,110
Like drive the snowmobile?

373
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,970
I'll find out how he's doing,okay?

374
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:29,205
Thanks.

375
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,085
Forget it,we're nevergoing to see the
cords.

376
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,595
All right,let's bag him up and prep the
neckfor a seldinger crike.

377
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:36,070
Hey,Abby,what's the statuson the other
snowmobile kid,Clarke Sutton?

378
00:15:36,105 --> 00:15:39,080
CT showed persistentpneumo,Kovac put in
a second tube.

379
00:15:39,115 --> 00:15:40,960
But other   an that he'sgood. Try Exam
Three.

380
00:15:40,995 --> 00:15:42,245
Okay,thanks.

381
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,860
Dr. Pratt,I'd like you to stop by my
officeat 4:00 today if that's possible.

382
00:15:45,895 --> 00:15:47,355
Cricothyroid is right here.

383
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:49,825
Ye  . Um... did you talk to Dr. Kovac
ye

384
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:54,120
Yes,we need to have a quick sit-down
withthe hospital lawyers about Edgar
Dixon.

385
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,050
Guide wire.

386
00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:00,060
Yeah,I was just at his funeral today. I
spoketo his wife. She's not pressing
any charges.

387
00:16:00,095 --> 00:16:02,195
She's not the problem,the board is.

388
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:06,140
They're not too happy Mr. Dixon was
gettinghis medications through his
church.

389
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:08,045
Medications that you distributed.

390
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,790
Yeah,but... who got theboard involved
in this?

391
00:16:10,825 --> 00:16:13,560
I don't know. 4:00.

392
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,875
- Abby,here's your introducer.- Greg...

393
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,630

394
00:16:18,665 --> 00:16:19,635

00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:28,981
<i>Do either of these belong to you?
</i>

398
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,010
He   How'd it go?

399
00:16:31,045 --> 00:16:32,815
Spectacular.

400
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:35,140
Sarcasm is a poor substitute for wit.

401
00:16:35,175 --> 00:16:37,430
Do you know who said that,young man?

402
00:16:37,465 --> 00:16:38,525
Do I car

403
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,930
Alex,don't be rude.Say you're sorry.

404
00:16:40,965 --> 00:16:42,035
Just relax,okay?

405
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,650
Hey. Don't tell me to relax.

406
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:47,250
I think it's time we  ent home.

407
00:16:47,285 --> 00:16:49,220
Okay,let's go.

408
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,460
March!

409
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,100
Hey.

410
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:07,410
So,uh,  nally get things  sort   out
with Neela?

411
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,520
There's nothing to sort ou   man.

412
00:17:09,555 --> 00:17:10,535
You sure?

413
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:12,900
Because it looks like yougot some
sorting out to do.

414
00:17:12,935 --> 00:17:15,230
Look,man,if you   need myadvice,all you
have to do is...

415
00:17:15,265 --> 00:17:17,475
No,no,no,no.No,I don't need your
advice.

416
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,920
I don't want your advice.I took your
advice,remember?

417
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,790
You know,"Give her some time,Ray. "

418
00:17:21,825 --> 00:17:23,810
"Give her so   s  ce,Ray. "

419
00:17:23,845 --> 00:17:25,325
Yeah,I did that.

420
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,230
In fact,I gave her so much time and so
muchspace, she started seeing somebody
else.

421
00:17:28,265 --> 00:17:30,540
- So thank you  or   the advice,Pratt.-
What? So that's...

422
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,165
Stop acting like a baby.

423
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,960
Why are you even here?Nobody invited
you.

424
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,955
It's time you startedshowing a little
res  ct.

425
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,750
And you need to mind yourown damn
business,bitch.

426
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,015
Don't   u ever talk...

427
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:48,260
Hey! And don't you ever to  h me.

428
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,760
You ever raise your hand to me

429
00:17:50,795 --> 00:17:52,535
or your mother or any other woman

430
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:55,250
I'll break every bone inyour sullen
little body.

431
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,740
Grandma's got some game.

432
00:17:58,775 --> 00:17:59,785
Ray...

433
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,089
your snowmobile kid's   t looking too
od.

434
00:18:02,235 --> 00:18:04,523
The one you insisted didn't need su
ery.

435
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,400
Hey,I got  his.

436
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,600
Thanks.

437
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,840
Hey,look,um...

438
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,935
I'm sorry about Alex.

439
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,910
You know,he's not always likethat. He's
had a rough year.

440
00:18:25,945 --> 00:18:28,075
You don't need to apologize for
him,Sam.

441
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,610
- I just don't want you to think
that...   - That he's what?

442
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,150
That h  s a teenager?

443
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,015
Sam,I was a holy terror at his age.

444
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:40,430
My principal suspended me fromschool
one time   r fighting.

445
00:18:40,465 --> 00:18:42,085
So you know what I did?

446
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,280
I slashed all the tires on his
Corvette.

447
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,925
That is a little delinquent.

448
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,700
Yeah,I was a real piece of work.

449
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,960
My mom raised me by herself,too,Sam,so
I know it's not easy.

450
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,470
We fought every single dayfor probably
ten straight years.

451
00:18:57,505 --> 00:19:00,020
And now we talk at   least once a week.

452
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,395
And we're best friends.

453
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:05,360
And in time,I'm sureyou and Alex will
be,too.

454
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,055
Hey,have you seen Dr. Pratt?

455
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,880
He's out in the ambulancebay waiting on
a rig.

456
00:19:11,915 --> 00:19:13,215
Thanks.

457
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,430
Hey,Abby,I have a working girlwith a
mandible dislocation.

458
00:19:15,465 --> 00:19:16,535
I've tried everything.

459
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,080
You know any tricks? No pun intended.

460
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,055
Can this wait ten minutes?

461
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:22,650
No,I've already paged Kovac and
Pratt.She pre-medicated,they're all
tied up.

462
00:19:22,685 --> 00:19:25,600
I've tried everything. It  on't budge.I
gave her 100 of fent.

463
00:19:25,635 --> 00:19:26,925
Add some midazolam.

464
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,785
How'd you do this,big yawn?

465
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:31,340
From what I gather,it was  an oral
occupational injury

466
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:33,460
she got while performing a service.

467
00:19:33,495 --> 00:19:36,050
Oh. Okay.

468
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:37,345
Two milligrams in.

469
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,910
Did you try it from behind?

470
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,600
Oh,you're talking to me?

471
00:19:42,635 --> 00:19:44,032
Relo  ting the mandible.

472
00:19:44,067 --> 00:19:45,395
Oh. No,that's a new o  .

473
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:48,090
From the back,you've got better
leveragefor downward force.

474
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:49,890
And you can put your weight into it.

475
00:19:49,925 --> 00:19:50,825
Makes sense.

476
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,570
You also get a better gri

477
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,940
Hey,Tony,got a visitor.

478
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,925
Sarah,what are you doing here?

479
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,540
I went up to your room    I saw your
boxes.

480
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,930
Why didn't you tell me?

481
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,040
I was going to.

482
00:20:07,075 --> 00:20:08,690
You lied to me.

483
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,780
Sarah,this really isn't a good time.Why
don't you guys go in the break room?

484
00:20:11,815 --> 00:20:14,012
Go with Sam and I'll bethere in a few
minutes.

485
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:16,210
You want to leave,thenleave. I don't
care anymore.

486
00:20:16,245 --> 00:20:17,480
- Sarah.- Want me to get her?

487
00:20:17,515 --> 00:20:19,470
Go ahead,I got this.

488
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,670
You okay?

489
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:27,990
Sarah,wait.

490
00:20:28,025 --> 00:20:29,065
Hey!

491
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,470
Stop and listen to me.

492
00:20:30,505 --> 00:20:31,245
No!

493
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,710
You can't tell me what to do,  you're
not my dad.

494
00:20:33,745 --> 00:20:36,242
Yes,but I'm your friend.

495
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:38,740
Friends don't leave.

496
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,940
Damn it,abdomen's rigid with fever.

497
00:20:56,975 --> 00:20:58,625
Crits stable,he's not bleeding.

498
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,420
Could be a bowel perf with peritonitis.

499
00:21:00,455 --> 00:21:02,350
Blood cultures and Zosyn 3.375.

500
00:21:02,385 --> 00:21:03,395
Should I get Gates?

501
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,290
No,no,no. No,I need  urgery down here.

502
00:21:05,325 --> 00:21:06,622
I already called them.

503
00:21:06,657 --> 00:21:07,885
Okay,mix up dopamine.

504
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,060
Dennis,De  is,can you hear me?

505
00:21:10,095 --> 00:21:12,165
I need you to start fighting,okay?

506
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,500
Your brother wants to talk to you.
PageNeela. Tell her I need her down
here,now!

507
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,270
Here you g

508
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:23,730
"Thank you,Tony. "You're welcome,Sarah.

509
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:26,430
Hey,come on,you can'tbe mad at me
forever.

510
00:21:26,465 --> 00:21:27,505
Why not?

511
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,910
Because of this...

512
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,105
What are you doing?

513
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,850
My sym  thetic doctor face.

514
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,895
You look stupid.

515
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:39,615
No? All right,you know what,you're
making me bring out the big guns.

516
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:43,530
When somebody is really sick and
it'svery fatal I say to them,"Mr.
Smith,

517
00:21:43,565 --> 00:21:45,215
"it's very fatal   you're very sick,

518
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,570
"the tumor's too big"for your very tiny
little head.

519
00:21:47,605 --> 00:21:49,130
"It's fatal. You're not going to live.

520
00:21:49,165 --> 00:21:50,865
Sir,you're going to die!"

521
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,710
- Okay,stop.- Then I give 'em this
face.

522
00:21:51,745 --> 00:21:53,570
Then I go...

523
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,850
Stop. Stop it.

524
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,060
It's not funny.

525
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:00,815
I'm mad at you.

526
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:04,250
I know. I'm sorry.I wanted to tell you.

527
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,615
Why do you have to go?

528
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:08,770
Because it's the right thing.

529
00:22:08,805 --> 00:22:11,070
Is it because of Neela?

530
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,485
You called her?

531
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,110
She was worried about you.

532
00:22:19,145 --> 00:22:20,847
Come on. Come on.

533
00:22:20,882 --> 00:22:22,515
What's happening?

534
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,885
Free air under the diaphragm.

535
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,415
Systolic's only 90 after two liters.

536
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:27,480
I'll throw in a subclavian,then
straight to the O.R.

537
00:22:27,515 --> 00:22:29,420
He s  med okay.Where's his stepfather?

538
00:22:29,455 --> 00:22:31,085
I sent Dawn to find him.

539
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,320
- Thanks for coming.- It's my job,Ray.

540
00:22:33,355 --> 00:22:35,237
Cordis introducer.

541
00:22:35,272 --> 00:22:37,120
Prime the infuser.

542
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,950
All right.

543
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,275
You have a minute?

544
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,270
Yeah. Why,what's up?

545
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,300
It was me- I called the medicalboard
about Edgar Dixon.

546
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,740
You?

547
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:56,865
Why the hell would you do that?

548
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,330
Because I heard he was getting hismeds
from some  octor at a church.

549
00:22:59,365 --> 00:23:01,120
I thought it was some unlicensed
crackpot.

550
00:23:01,155 --> 00:23:02,785
Oh,Abby.

551
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,830
I'm really sorry.

552
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,075
It's all right.

553
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,510
I'm sorry,I thought Iwas doing the
right thing.

554
00:23:07,545 --> 00:23:09,285
You were. We both were.

555
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,725
Sometimes you do the right thing an
youstill get shafted.    Don't sweat
it.

556
00:23:12,805 --> 00:23:15,650
Hey,Greg,these detectiveswould like to
talk to you.

557
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,255
About what?

558
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:19,710
Your involvement with apatient named
Edgar Dixon.

559
00:23:19,745 --> 00:23:21,700
I called Angela. She's on her way down.

560
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:22,595
All right,thanks.

561
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:26,050
Dr. Pratt,is there someplacewe could go
talk in private?

562
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,610
Yeah,sure.

563
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,780
Right this way.

564
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:39,760
Yo,Ab  ,I've been looking for you.That
patient you were asking about?

565
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:41,787
- Boom,he left a message.-   anks.

566
00:23:41,822 --> 00:23:43,780
Let me g  ss,your friend Eddie again.

567
00:23:43,815 --> 00:23:44,875
What,are you jealous?

568
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:48,570
No,I just don't understand   why
you'regiving this guy so much
attention.

569
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,960
He's a 60-year-old man with
lungdisease. I'm just trying to help
him out.

570
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,825
Hi.

571
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:00,110
Hi... Kerry...

572
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,130
Uh,we can talk about this later.

573
00:24:03,165 --> 00:24:05,280
Or not.

574
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,295
Everything all right?

575
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:20,580
Yeah,just a disagreement about a
patient.

576
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:25,090
Hmm. Gotcha.

577
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,630
I still can't believe you're leaving.

578
00:24:31,665 --> 00:24:34,777
Yeah,it feels a little weird.

579
00:24:34,812 --> 00:24:37,890
Scary,but,uh,it's exciting.

580
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:42,430
I'm actually going to miss this place.

581
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:50,670
- You know...- List  ,I just want to...

582
00:24:50,705 --> 00:24:51,920
- No,no,no...- No,go ahead.

583
00:24:51,955 --> 00:24:53,650
- No...- You go.

584
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:02,490
I just want to say that Ithink that
you've probably

585
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:07,705
uh,seen me... at my best,

586
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:12,590
and um... and at my wo  t.

587
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,300
And even though we didn'talways see eye
to eye,um...

588
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,920
...you helped me go from a  urse

589
00:25:21,955 --> 00:25:24,500
to a med student...

590
00:25:24,535 --> 00:25:27,470
to a doctor...

591
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,720
...to a mom.

592
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:38,670
I'm the one who's supposed to be upset
here.

593
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:41,840
I know. Sorry.

594
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:53,010
You were always thereas a nurse and a
doctor

595
00:25:53,045 --> 00:25:56,510
and most importantly,yo  ve  Iways been
here

596
00:25:56,545 --> 00:25:58,740
as my friend.

597
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,350
Do you think this   ppens    the
guyswhen one of them leaves?

598
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:18,760
I heard Carter bawledlike a baby when
he left.

599
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:24,550
I'm going to miss you.

600
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:28,240
Thank you.

601
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:34,780
And now it's time for usto take care of
ourselves.

602
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,300
You can still hang out with Tony.

603
00:26:37,335 --> 00:26:38,615
It won't be the same.

604
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:40,885
No,but it will still be good.

605
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,070
You can go to Tony's placewhen I get on
your nerves.

606
00:26:43,105 --> 00:26:45,220
Oh,easy,now. I don't wantthe kid living
wit  me.

607
00:26:45,255 --> 00:26:46,960
I can stay at your place sometimes?

608
00:26:46,995 --> 00:26:48,595
If it's okay with your mom.

609
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:50,915
I'm going to have a swinging bachelor
pad.

610
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:53,740
I'm going to have abig-screen TV over
the Jacuzzi,

611
00:26:53,775 --> 00:26:56,392
trampoline and a shark tank,the works.

612
00:26:56,427 --> 00:26:59,010
Nothing stays the same forever,Sarah.

613
00:26:59,045 --> 00:27:01,060
It's part of growing up.

614
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:04,440
Besides,you won't care about mein a few
years anyway.

615
00:27:04,475 --> 00:27:06,930
You're going to run offand marry that
horn dog character

616
00:27:06,965 --> 00:27:08,780
and have six kids and eight cats...

617
00:27:08,815 --> 00:27:10,152
We broke up.

618
00:27:10,187 --> 00:27:11,455
- What?- Yeah.

619
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:14,250
Oh,you know,I really never liked that
guy.

620
00:27:14,285 --> 00:27:16,180
It was my fault.

621
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,410
He found out I I like Kevin Mclntyre.

622
00:27:18,445 --> 00:27:20,390
Jezebel.

623
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,350
Better get going,kiddo.

624
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:31,890
Let Tony get back to work.

625
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,150
Hey...Hey.

626
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:41,800
Baby girl.

627
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:58,310
His vitals have stabilized.Let's get
him up to O.R. Two.

628
00:27:58,345 --> 00:28:00,020
I'll call you when   's out of surgery.

629
00:28:00,055 --> 00:28:01,310
Thanks.

630
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:05,205
Neela.

631
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,305
Neela,I need to say something.

632
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,570
No,you don't. You did what youthought
was right for the patient.

633
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:10,515
I respect that,Ray.

634
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,760
No,see... no,that's not it.

635
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,620
Then what is it?

636
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:19,935
Uh... this is probably wrong,I know.

637
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:22,950
It's the wrong place,thewrong
time,but,uh...

638
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,190
Why didn't somebody page me?

639
00:28:26,225 --> 00:28:27,347
We handled it.

640
00:28:27,382 --> 00:28:28,435
What happened?

641
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:30,905
Seems like your patienthas a perforated
viscus.

642
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,570
Really? Good thing we didn'tsend him
home,huh,Rock Star?

643
00:28:33,605 --> 00:28:36,160
Looks like h  needed observation after
all.

644
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,925
It's not small bowel
perforation,okay,Tony?

645
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,530
This has nothing to dowith the seat
belt sign.

646
00:28:40,565 --> 00:28:41,475
How do you figure?

647
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:44,040
Small bowel doesn't seedthe peritoneum
like this.

648
00:28:44,075 --> 00:28:45,255
It's colonic,maybe diverticular.

649
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:47,670
Really? Interesting. Tell me
more,Doctor.

650
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,780
Where are they taking Dennis?

651
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,430
He's going up to surgery,if you really
care.

652
00:28:55,465 --> 00:28:56,365
What the hell's that supposed to mean?

653
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,420
You know,I sent a nurseto find you 30
minutes ago.

654
00:28:58,455 --> 00:28:59,285
I was with my son.

655
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,970
Yeah? Well,this one needed you,too.

656
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:02,585
You know what,actually I'm sorry.

657
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,500
He needed a parent. Maybe Ishould have
called his mother.

658
00:29:04,535 --> 00:29:05,995
Hey,y    e gut    line.

659
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:08,810
ithe  one    them   would even
be(inhere   if Denni  wasn't scre  ng
aro

660
00:29:08,845 --> 00:29:11,390
T/          Denn   w  n't  en   iving.
Clark  was.

661
00:29:11,425 --> 00:29:13,075
- That's nkt true.- Ye   it is.

662
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:16,440
But did you even   ther to ask
him?No,you just blamed him from the
get-go.

663
00:29:16,475 --> 00:29:17,687
Why didn't he say something?

664
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:18,865
Would you have   believed h  ?

665
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,520
He was trying toprotect his little
brother.

666
00:29:21,555 --> 00:29:24,140
Dennis is older. Heshould have known
better.

667
00:29:24,175 --> 00:29:26,420
He's 15.

668
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:31,370
Do you know that he carried
Clarkealmost   mile to the road to get
help?

669
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:33,415
So instead of busting his balls,

670
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:36,760
maybe you should be thanking him.He
probably saved your son's life.

671
00:29:36,795 --> 00:29:39,185
Hey,you know,I don'tthink I like your
attitude.

672
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,110
Really? I   n't thin  I likethe way you
treat your kid.

673
00:29:41,145 --> 00:29:43,530
ere do you get offtalking to me like
this?

674
00:29:43,565 --> 00:29:45,545
Where's your supervisor?

675
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:48,230
You don't know a damnthing about me or
my family.

676
00:29:48,265 --> 00:29:49,715
No,no,no,that's wrong.

677
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,370
'Cause I know that Dennis is a good
kid,

678
00:29:51,405 --> 00:29:53,395
and I know that you are an asshole.

679
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:55,910
Yeah,and if I were you,I'd
probablystart to treat him a little
better.

680
00:29:55,945 --> 00:29:58,437
Because in a couple years he'sprobably
going to be bigger than you,

681
00:29:58,472 --> 00:30:00,930
and he is going to rememberevery single
time you treated him like crap,

682
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:04,790
and one day he is goingto kick your
ass,okay?

683
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,480
You got a valid medical license,Dr.
Pratt?

684
00:30:10,515 --> 00:30:11,355
Of course.

685
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,605
What about a pharmacist   lic  se?

686
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,820
My medical license allowsme to write
prescriptions.

687
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:16,555
Write,yeah,

688
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:20,560
but diverting controlled substances to
anunauthorized distributor that's a
felony.

689
00:30:20,595 --> 00:30:23,580
I wasn't diverting anything,Iwas
treating patients.

690
00:30:23,615 --> 00:30:25,360
At this illegal clinic of yours?

691
00:30:25,395 --> 00:30:26,705
Illegal clinic?

692
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:29,540
All right,come on,fellas,let's no  get
carried away here,okay?

693
00:30:29,575 --> 00:30:32,340
Look,I was helping out at a churchwhere
most of the congregation

694
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:33,940
doesn't even have health insurance.

695
00:30:33,975 --> 00:30:36,040
Like the man that you killed?

696
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,790
Isn't one of you supposedto be the good
cop?

697
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:41,165
Ray.

698
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,990
Look,Dr. Weaver,I just spent the whole
day withthis great kid who saved his
little brother's life,

699
00:30:46,025 --> 00:30:50,780
and when his stepfather came in and
started toberate and belittle him in
front of everyone,I just...

700
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:53,780
I don't know,I guess he just reminded
meof someone I used to know.

701
00:30:53,815 --> 00:30:56,000
Yeah,I was just coming to say good-bye.

702
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:01,930
I may have done a great disserviceto
the world of rock keeping you here,

703
00:31:01,965 --> 00:31:04,780
but you could be a great doctor,Ray.

704
00:31:04,815 --> 00:31:07,072
I kind of thought I was.

705
00:31:07,107 --> 00:31:09,330
I'm kidding.  rt of. Um...

706
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,320
Wow,um...

707
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,900
Thank you,Dr. Weaver.Thank you for
everything.

708
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:21,510
So what do we do now?Um,hug,kiss?

709
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:22,905
All right.

710
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,530
So what's next,you guys gonnabeat me
with a rubber hose?

711
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,140
What the hell is going on?

712
00:31:27,175 --> 00:31:28,450
Dr. Pratt is under arrest.

713
00:31:28,485 --> 00:31:29,275
On what charges?

714
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:31,490
Violation of the Controlled Substance
Act.

715
00:31:31,525 --> 00:31:32,652
Do you believe these jokers?

716
00:31:32,687 --> 00:31:33,888
You had to handcuff him?

717
00:31:33,923 --> 00:31:35,055
It's a felony charge,Doc.

718
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:36,280
Aw,come on,guys,you can't do this.

719
00:31:36,315 --> 00:31:37,695
Back off,Doc.

720
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,670
Unless you want to go with him.

721
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,960
She's playing with thebunnies,I'm
looking for my camera...

722
00:31:50,995 --> 00:31:55,005
d then,suddenly,we hearthis God-awful
scream,

723
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:59,270
and we see this billy goathas Sammy by
the pigtails.

724
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,880
Speak of the devil!

725
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:06,020
Gracie invited me to dinner.

726
00:32:06,055 --> 00:32:07,540
She did?

727
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:09,680
Hi,Mr. Owens.

728
00:32:09,715 --> 00:32:10,755
Evening,Sam.

729
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:12,860
Don't worry. I'm not staying for
dinner.

730
00:32:12,895 --> 00:32:14,260
Thanks for the dessert,Gracie.

731
00:32:14,295 --> 00:32:16,435
Anytime,Bennet.

732
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,940
I baked a blueberry pie.I'm making fish
and chips.

733
00:32:18,975 --> 00:32:19,905
Night,Sam.

734
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,610
Hey,you need a hand   thanything,Mr.
Owens?

735
00:32:21,645 --> 00:32:23,820
No. I'm good,thanks.

736
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:29,110
I... I was just telling the boys about
howthe goat ate your pigtails at the
petting  oo.

737
00:32:29,145 --> 00:32:31,545
Great. Where's Alex?

738
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:34,260
He's in his room. He's doing his
homework.

739
00:32:34,295 --> 00:32:37,000
At least he better be.

740
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:48,400
Nice shot.

741
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:50,375
Hey,what are you doing here?

742
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:52,240
Why didn't you  ome back   to the
hospital?

743
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,840
How did you find me?

744
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:57,000
Guy at your hotel said you might be
here.

745
00:32:57,035 --> 00:32:58,375
And,in case you're interested,

746
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:01,200
your test results show that yourlungs
aren't expanding properly.

747
00:33:01,235 --> 00:33:03,320
They've become fibrotic.

748
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,770
Guess I'll have to switch to menthols.

749
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:10,750
You didn't have to come here.

750
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:13,195
Eight ball,corner pocket.

751
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:15,425
You're not getting enoughoxygen in your
blood.

752
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,780
You're going to need an
echocardiogramto check your cardiac
function.

753
00:33:18,815 --> 00:33:20,960
tter luck next time,chief.

754
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,760
You need to be referred to a
specialist.

755
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:30,595
No more doctor stuff,huh?

756
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:33,139
Well,we need to find outwhat's causin
this,Eddie.

757
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:36,325
No,we don't. Abby,listen...

758
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,980
I don't understand why you got the
tests ifyou weren't planning on
following through.

759
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,020
I don't care about my damn lungs.

760
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,230
I didn't keep coming tosee you for
health reasons.

761
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:50,440
Okay. Well,th  ,talk tome. What's going
on,huh?

762
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,320
I been taking care of myself my whole
life,

763
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:00,430
usually at the expense of others.

764
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,970
I appreciate your concern,

765
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:11,200
but I don't deserve it.

766
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,900
You know,I...    I shouldn't have come
here.

767
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:29,885
Abby?

768
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,240
Look,just stay away from me. Okay?

769
00:34:31,275 --> 00:34:32,212
Let me explain something.

770
00:34:32,247 --> 00:34:33,115
No,you don't... Don't.

771
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,700
You don't have to. It'sjust a
mistake,all right?

772
00:34:34,735 --> 00:34:35,885
Abby,I know what you're feeling.

773
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,560
No,I don't think you do,because I don't
know what I'm feeling.

774
00:34:38,595 --> 00:34:39,990
And you're right. Ididn't need to come
here.

775
00:34:40,025 --> 00:34:41,820
And I shouldn't have come here.

776
00:34:41,855 --> 00:34:43,805
Abby,I lied to you.

777
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,880
I didn't want to scare you off.

778
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,825
My name isn't Jackson.

779
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:52,240
It's Wyczenski. I'm your father.

780
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,895
Yeah. I talked to Maggie a while back.

781
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:57,835
- Probably going on three years.- No.
No.

782
00:34:57,870 --> 00:35:00,620
Yeah. I got caught up onyou and your
brother,Eric,

783
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,672
- fore she started screaming at me.- No
no...

784
00:35:02,745 --> 00:35:03,955
This is not happening.

785
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:07,260
Yeah,it is. She told me you wereworking
at the hospital here in Chicago.

786
00:35:07,295 --> 00:35:09,280
You know,why are you doing this?

787
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,240
I wanted to see for myself.

788
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,425
After 30 years?

789
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:16,570
Yeah. I wanted to see what sortof a
person you grew up to be.

790
00:35:16,605 --> 00:35:18,715
- Oh,God! I can't do this.- Took me two
years

791
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,550
- to work up the nerve to come and
visit you.- I cannot do this!

792
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:23,240
One of the nurses atthe triage desk,she
pointed you out to me,

793
00:35:23,275 --> 00:35:25,535
- and I got cold feet.- Taxi!

794
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:27,205
You know,if you hadn't walked into the
bar,

795
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:31,690
I... I probably would have leftwithout
ever speaking to you.

796
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:35,155
But when I met you,I wanted to know
more,

797
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:38,520
but I didn't have thegut to tell you
the truth,

798
00:35:38,555 --> 00:35:40,007
because I thought you'd tell me to go
away.

799
00:35:40,042 --> 00:35:41,460
Well,guess what. You were right. Go
away!

800
00:35:41,495 --> 00:35:43,620
- Go away.- Oh,Abby...

801
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,180
Abby,please.

802
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,815
No. Just leave me alon   All right?

803
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:52,840
You don't get to do this. It's not
fair.

804
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:06,280
Hey,Kerry!

805
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:09,105
Hey.

806
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:11,270
Hey. I didn't get a chanceto say
good-bye to Pratt.

807
00:36:11,305 --> 00:36:13,400
I'm on my way to the policestation to
bail him out.

808
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,970
That's one of those parts of the
jobthey never tell you about.

809
00:36:17,005 --> 00:36:19,930
One of the many partsthat I'm not going
to miss.

810
00:36:19,965 --> 00:36:22,010
Look,hey,I never had a chance to tell
you...

811
00:36:22,045 --> 00:36:23,545
Luka,Luka,you know what?

812
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:26,285
I'm done talking about th  . Really.
Please?

813
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,990
I... I know...but,hey,you... you hired
me.

814
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,815
I still remember my first day.

815
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:35,245
An oxygen tankrocketed through the
E.R.- almost killed me.

816
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,640
Well,no one ever said thiswas the
safest place to work.

817
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:45,050
You... you changed mylife by giving me
this job.

818
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,890
You may even have saved it.

819
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:58,140
I don't know where I'd beif   hadn't
found this place.

820
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:03,910
And you taught me a lot.

821
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,630
Thank you.

822
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,810
Come here,you big Croat...

823
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,325
You know what? Don't get up...

824
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:26,140
Don't get caught up inthe politics,all
right?

825
00:37:26,175 --> 00:37:29,920
A good hospital is aboutpeople and
medicine.

826
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,780
Thank you.

827
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,380
I'll see y   around sometime.

828
00:37:41,415 --> 00:37:43,400
Yeah.

829
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,980
Luka...

830
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,230
Take care of this place for me.

831
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:00,100
I will.

832
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:12,010
*******

833
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:35,090
It's getting late,so I'd better get
going.

834
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,835
But we don't   even work tomorrow.

835
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:41,195
Yeah,but I'm like Gracie.And I need my
beauty sleep.

836
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:45,520
Well... you could sleephere tonight if
you want.

837
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:48,715
It would save you all that driving.

838
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:52,950
Yeah,but you have that ruleagainst
workplace fraternization.

839
00:38:52,985 --> 00:38:58,107
It's actually more ofa guideline than a
rule.

840
00:38:58,142 --> 00:39:03,230
And it applies moreto doctors than
nurses.

841
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,770
Hmm. That's good to know.

842
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:13,790
And Alex and Gracie would be okay with
this?

843
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,970
Come on.

844
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,315
Here's a two bedroom onLakeshore with a
concierge.

845
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:54,670
Hey,I always wanted to livein a
building with a concierge.

846
00:39:54,705 --> 00:39:56,410
You can't possibly   forda place on
Lakeshore.

847
00:39:56,445 --> 00:39:57,577
$3,600 a month.

848
00:39:57,612 --> 00:39:59,161
Like I said...

849
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:00,710
$1,8   apiece.

850
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,920
What? Are you going tosplit it with the
