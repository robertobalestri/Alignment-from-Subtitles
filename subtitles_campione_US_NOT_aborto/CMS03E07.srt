1
00:00:04,256 --> 00:00:06,295
Is Owen asleep?

2
00:00:09,102 --> 00:00:12,037
Yep, coast is clear.

3
00:00:14,207 --> 00:00:16,355
See you in the morning.

4
00:00:17,534 --> 00:00:19,669
See you in the morning.

5
00:00:34,227 --> 00:00:35,627
So I bought a ticket for Minneapolis.

6
00:00:35,662 --> 00:00:37,696
I'm heading out tonight.

7
00:00:37,731 --> 00:00:39,198
Really?

8
00:00:39,232 --> 00:00:42,434
We'll see what she has to say
face-to-face.

9
00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:44,933
Connor, you sure that you
don't want to...

10
00:00:45,071 --> 00:00:47,139
I don't know, just, uh,

11
00:00:47,207 --> 00:00:48,824
think about let... letting it go?

12
00:00:48,864 --> 00:00:50,926
I'm sorry, Dr. Charles.

13
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,305
I love your daughter.
I'm not going to lose her.

14
00:00:57,707 --> 00:00:59,342
Get it away from me!

15
00:00:59,367 --> 00:01:01,543
Dr. Choi, Dr. Manning!
You're going to 3.

16
00:01:01,577 --> 00:01:03,678
I got LeAnn Crawford, 22,

17
00:01:03,713 --> 00:01:06,076
found attached to her newborn
on the sidewalk

18
00:01:06,116 --> 00:01:07,382
in a pool of blood.

19
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:09,017
Combative in the field.
I couldn't cut the cord.

20
00:01:09,051 --> 00:01:10,788
- Drugs?
- Wouldn't surprise me.

21
00:01:10,828 --> 00:01:13,632
- Get it away from me!
- Ma'am, this is your baby.

22
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:15,429
Oh, no, it's a... it's a monster.

23
00:01:15,454 --> 00:01:18,235
She may be in withdrawal.
I need 4 milligrams of Versed, IV.

24
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:19,498
- On it.
- Not until we cut the cord.

25
00:01:19,523 --> 00:01:20,701
Please get this thing away from me!

26
00:01:20,726 --> 00:01:23,052
Let's get her in restraints!
Ma'am, I need you to listen to me.

27
00:01:23,077 --> 00:01:24,671
Get it away!

28
00:01:24,696 --> 00:01:27,164
Whoa, she tore the cord!

29
00:01:29,711 --> 00:01:31,744
All right, let's transfer on my count.

30
00:01:32,013 --> 00:01:35,416
Ready? One, two, three.

31
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,263
Give her the Versed. She's bleeding out.

32
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,657
We've got to deliver this placenta now.

33
00:01:38,692 --> 00:01:40,459
No, it's a... it's a monster!

34
00:01:40,494 --> 00:01:41,994
Kill... kill it.

35
00:01:42,029 --> 00:01:44,547
Baby's temp is 94. I need more blankets!

36
00:01:44,572 --> 00:01:46,265
- Versed's in!
- Let's start an IV.

37
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:48,834
Get two units of O neg on the rapid
transfuser and start the MTP.

38
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:50,069
Vitals at 86.

39
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:52,112
Turn the O2 up to ten liters.

40
00:01:52,139 --> 00:01:53,806
I got the placenta.

41
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,342
Heart rate's down. Pressure's stable.

42
00:01:56,376 --> 00:01:58,144
Baby's starting to pink up.

43
00:01:58,233 --> 00:02:00,801
Hey. Hey, listen to me.

44
00:02:00,831 --> 00:02:03,132
You just had a baby.

45
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:06,035
That's your baby.

46
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:07,736
Baby?

47
00:02:09,906 --> 00:02:12,342
Call Child and Family Services.

48
00:02:12,376 --> 00:02:15,212
No way she's taking this baby home.

49
00:02:15,246 --> 00:02:18,048
Baby? Baby?

50
00:02:23,783 --> 00:02:28,381
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx
<font color="#0080ff">www.</font>addic7ed<font color="#0080ff">.com</font>

51
00:02:30,061 --> 00:02:32,195
Okay.

52
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,664
Temperature's back to 98.

53
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:36,900
I'll be back to check on him
in a little bit.

54
00:02:36,934 --> 00:02:38,568
Poor thing.

55
00:02:38,603 --> 00:02:41,938
Let me know if anything changes.

56
00:02:44,242 --> 00:02:46,109
Hey, how's the mom?

57
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:48,044
Better, apparently,
after a little methadone.

58
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,779
I'm gonna talk to her about detox.

59
00:02:49,814 --> 00:02:51,181
Tox screen showed heroin.

60
00:02:51,215 --> 00:02:52,682
Great. Odds are the baby's

61
00:02:52,717 --> 00:02:53,884
going to have the same result.

62
00:02:53,918 --> 00:02:56,720
Eh, never know.
Might be a high-stress user.

63
00:02:56,754 --> 00:02:58,622
Baby could be fine.

64
00:02:58,656 --> 00:03:00,590
Maybe.

65
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:03,026
Ms. Crawford?

66
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,427
I'm Dr. Charles. Uh...

67
00:03:04,462 --> 00:03:06,396
glad to see you're doing
a little better.

68
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,633
Anything we can get you?
Something to drink?

69
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:11,101
I just want to go.

70
00:03:11,135 --> 00:03:12,903
I don't blame you,
but we do need to make sure

71
00:03:12,937 --> 00:03:14,571
that you're stable first.

72
00:03:14,605 --> 00:03:18,542
So, you do understand that
the DCFS is on the way

73
00:03:18,576 --> 00:03:21,545
to arrange a custodian for your child?

74
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:22,779
Yeah.

75
00:03:22,813 --> 00:03:24,179
Okay.

76
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,685
I was looking at your tox
screen and I'm just curious.

77
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,985
How long have you been using for?

78
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,555
Roughly?

79
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:34,658
The reason I ask is that we do
have a number of programs here

80
00:03:34,692 --> 00:03:37,227
at the hospital that are...
that are available to you.

81
00:03:37,261 --> 00:03:38,662
One particular, um...

82
00:03:38,696 --> 00:03:40,597
I-I said I-I just want to go.

83
00:03:40,631 --> 00:03:42,299
I understand that, but this
would be an opportunity...

84
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,668
Dr. Charles,
can I talk to you for a second?

85
00:03:47,705 --> 00:03:50,073
Yeah.

86
00:03:50,107 --> 00:03:54,077
Uh, get some rest. I'll, uh,
check in with you later.

87
00:03:57,181 --> 00:03:58,648
You're wasting your time.

88
00:03:58,683 --> 00:04:00,850
You do understand
that we have an obligation

89
00:04:00,885 --> 00:04:02,586
to try to get addicts into a program

90
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,321
- before they leave the hospital?
- Yeah, but clearly,

91
00:04:04,355 --> 00:04:05,822
- she doesn't want our help.
- We don't know that.

92
00:04:05,856 --> 00:04:07,591
We almost never get through
on the first shot.

93
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,292
She won't even talk to you, Dr. Charles.

94
00:04:09,327 --> 00:04:10,927
Ethan, somebody puts up
a wall like that...

95
00:04:10,962 --> 00:04:13,296
they're usually trying
to protect something.

96
00:04:13,331 --> 00:04:15,832
That's often worth chipping away at.

97
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,408
Barry.

98
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,545
Can you not see that I'm working?

99
00:04:28,579 --> 00:04:31,381
I'm just trying to get a closer look.

100
00:04:31,415 --> 00:04:35,552
Observing the charge nurse
in her natural habitat.

101
00:04:35,586 --> 00:04:37,153
Aren't the paramedics supposed to

102
00:04:37,188 --> 00:04:39,155
drop off their patients and leave?

103
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,524
Not paramedics with an agenda.

104
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:43,560
Mm.

105
00:04:43,594 --> 00:04:45,562
Have dinner with me tonight.

106
00:04:45,596 --> 00:04:48,198
My answer's the same
as it was last time:

107
00:04:48,232 --> 00:04:49,899
no.

108
00:04:49,934 --> 00:04:51,801
Why not?

109
00:04:51,836 --> 00:04:53,236
We went out for drinks.

110
00:04:53,271 --> 00:04:54,371
Right, drinks.

111
00:04:54,405 --> 00:04:55,872
That's not a date.

112
00:04:55,906 --> 00:04:57,474
Having dinner is dating,

113
00:04:57,508 --> 00:05:00,043
and we are not having dinner.

114
00:05:00,077 --> 00:05:01,411
Well, not yet.

115
00:05:01,445 --> 00:05:05,015
It's not even lunchtime.

116
00:05:08,452 --> 00:05:11,488
Hey, Miss Dempsey. Mr. Goodwin.

117
00:05:11,522 --> 00:05:12,656
- Dr. Halstead.
- Haven't seen you in a while.

118
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,257
- What's going on?
- Still no cure

119
00:05:14,292 --> 00:05:16,359
for supranuclear palsy, as you can see.

120
00:05:16,394 --> 00:05:18,094
But we do therapy three times a week

121
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:20,063
and try to get around the block
every night after dinner.

122
00:05:20,097 --> 00:05:21,665
That's good.

123
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:24,267
Let's get you onto the bed here.

124
00:05:24,302 --> 00:05:25,869
Oh.

125
00:05:25,903 --> 00:05:27,404
I see they keep making these things

126
00:05:27,438 --> 00:05:28,772
higher and higher.

127
00:05:28,806 --> 00:05:30,507
Yeah, it's completely unacceptable.

128
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,208
I'll look into it immediately.

129
00:05:34,912 --> 00:05:36,913
How long have you had that cough?

130
00:05:36,947 --> 00:05:39,449
A few days now.

131
00:05:39,483 --> 00:05:41,518
Temp's 103.

132
00:05:41,552 --> 00:05:43,687
Has the palsy been making it
harder to swallow?

133
00:05:43,721 --> 00:05:46,690
Uh, yeah, in the last couple of months.

134
00:05:46,724 --> 00:05:48,692
Bert keeps making me smoothies,

135
00:05:48,726 --> 00:05:52,128
but I sneak in a granola bar
every now and then.

136
00:05:52,163 --> 00:05:53,763
Lean forward for me, would you?

137
00:05:53,798 --> 00:05:55,265
Sure.

138
00:06:02,173 --> 00:06:03,473
Yeah, you're pretty clogged up.

139
00:06:03,507 --> 00:06:04,774
Wouldn't surprise me if

140
00:06:04,809 --> 00:06:06,042
something went down the wrong tube

141
00:06:06,077 --> 00:06:07,138
and turned into a pneumonia.

142
00:06:07,163 --> 00:06:08,855
Well, you can treat that, can't you?

143
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,314
Yes. I'm gonna start
you on some antibiotics

144
00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:12,382
while we wait for the culture results,

145
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:13,783
but for right now,

146
00:06:13,818 --> 00:06:14,818
you do nothing,

147
00:06:14,852 --> 00:06:15,819
and I'll be back soon.

148
00:06:15,853 --> 00:06:17,053
I can do that.

149
00:06:17,088 --> 00:06:18,855
Good.

150
00:06:22,927 --> 00:06:24,828
Dr. Halstead?

151
00:06:24,862 --> 00:06:27,564
I know she has a degenerative disease,

152
00:06:27,598 --> 00:06:30,066
and that I won't have her
forever, but, uh,

153
00:06:30,101 --> 00:06:32,569
her mind's all there.

154
00:06:32,603 --> 00:06:35,338
I want to be able to take her home.

155
00:06:35,373 --> 00:06:38,808
I promise I'm gonna do everything I can.

156
00:06:38,843 --> 00:06:40,810
Thank you.

157
00:06:42,446 --> 00:06:45,483
- Hey, dinner tonight?
- Can't.

158
00:06:45,516 --> 00:06:47,951
Going to watch Noah's hockey game.

159
00:06:47,985 --> 00:06:50,153
I know that stuff's
not a big deal to you,

160
00:06:50,187 --> 00:06:51,321
but it's important to me.

161
00:06:51,355 --> 00:06:52,589
"That stuff"? You mean

162
00:06:52,623 --> 00:06:54,090
adult rec league sports?

163
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,658
I mean family.

164
00:06:55,693 --> 00:06:57,627
Why do you think family's
not a big deal to me?

165
00:06:57,661 --> 00:07:00,296
I don't know. You never talk about them.

166
00:07:00,331 --> 00:07:02,799
There's nothing to talk about.

167
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,834
Okay.

168
00:07:04,869 --> 00:07:06,269
Hey, Ava.

169
00:07:06,303 --> 00:07:08,338
Can you cover for me tomorrow?

170
00:07:08,372 --> 00:07:09,706
Sure. Are you getting sick?

171
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,341
No, I'm headed to Minneapolis.

172
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:14,778
That sounds even worse.
Why are you going there?

173
00:07:14,812 --> 00:07:17,280
Oh, is that where Robin moved to?

174
00:07:17,314 --> 00:07:18,448
Yeah, it is.

175
00:07:18,482 --> 00:07:19,649
So, this is what,

176
00:07:19,683 --> 00:07:21,451
a misguided attempt to win her back?

177
00:07:21,485 --> 00:07:23,453
- Forget I asked.
- No, I'm happy to do it,

178
00:07:23,487 --> 00:07:24,788
mostly because I find your gift

179
00:07:24,822 --> 00:07:26,790
for self-flagellation fascinating.

180
00:07:26,824 --> 00:07:28,391
What is that supposed to mean?

181
00:07:28,426 --> 00:07:29,793
Just that, from what
I gather, this sounds like

182
00:07:29,827 --> 00:07:30,794
a fool's errand.

183
00:07:30,828 --> 00:07:33,396
CT's own Dr. Phil? Thank you.

184
00:07:33,431 --> 00:07:34,631
Dr. who?

185
00:07:34,665 --> 00:07:36,733
Dr. Rhodes, CFD just called.

186
00:07:36,767 --> 00:07:38,668
They've got a man trapped
in a collapsed building

187
00:07:38,702 --> 00:07:40,303
and need a surgeon.
You're on trauma today?

188
00:07:40,337 --> 00:07:41,638
- I am.
- Good.

189
00:07:41,672 --> 00:07:43,173
Ambo's waiting
to take you there right now,

190
00:07:43,207 --> 00:07:44,541
and take Dr. Bekker, too.

191
00:07:44,575 --> 00:07:46,142
You could use a second pair of hands.

192
00:07:46,177 --> 00:07:47,377
She is CT. How about

193
00:07:47,411 --> 00:07:48,578
one of the other trauma surgeons?

194
00:07:48,612 --> 00:07:49,813
I'm already losing you.

195
00:07:49,847 --> 00:07:51,381
I can't afford to lose another.

196
00:07:51,415 --> 00:07:53,483
I'll let Dr. Latham know where you are.

197
00:07:53,517 --> 00:07:55,653
Let's move it.

198
00:07:56,411 --> 00:07:58,655
You wanted to see me?

199
00:07:58,689 --> 00:08:01,224
Yeah, uh, what's the status

200
00:08:01,258 --> 00:08:03,393
on Dr. Reese's probation?

201
00:08:03,427 --> 00:08:05,094
Well, she's been doing

202
00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:06,763
daily individualized therapy

203
00:08:06,797 --> 00:08:08,498
and a course in hospital safety,

204
00:08:08,532 --> 00:08:10,667
so she should be in good shape
to start back up.

205
00:08:10,701 --> 00:08:12,735
Uh, good. I'd like you to give me

206
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:15,872
a detailed progress report
once she returns to work.

207
00:08:15,906 --> 00:08:18,074
Well, actually, I'm not going
to be supervising her anymore.

208
00:08:18,108 --> 00:08:20,343
She's going to be working
under Dr. Chapman.

209
00:08:20,377 --> 00:08:21,611
Why?

210
00:08:21,645 --> 00:08:23,012
Under my supervision, Dr. Reese

211
00:08:23,047 --> 00:08:25,181
assaulted a patient with pepper spray.

212
00:08:25,216 --> 00:08:27,684
You know, and... I don't know.
My clinical approach

213
00:08:27,718 --> 00:08:29,619
might have had something
to do with it, so...

214
00:08:29,653 --> 00:08:31,254
I just think for now,

215
00:08:31,288 --> 00:08:33,356
Dr. Chapman might be a better fit.

216
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,959
Okay. Whatever you think is best.

217
00:08:35,993 --> 00:08:37,527
Okay.

218
00:08:37,561 --> 00:08:39,028
Uh, Sharon, I heard that...

219
00:08:39,063 --> 00:08:40,530
that Bert's back in the hospital today.

220
00:08:40,564 --> 00:08:44,200
Yeah, I heard that, too.

221
00:08:50,574 --> 00:08:52,575
Dr. Manning.

222
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:54,077
- What's going on?
- He's inconsolable.

223
00:08:54,111 --> 00:08:56,279
I've tried rocking him, swaddling him,

224
00:08:56,313 --> 00:08:57,714
singing. Nothing I do calms him down.

225
00:08:57,748 --> 00:08:59,282
Oh, hi.

226
00:08:59,316 --> 00:09:00,717
Heart rate's in the 190s.

227
00:09:00,751 --> 00:09:02,452
O2 sats have been dropping.

228
00:09:02,486 --> 00:09:03,953
Has he been feeding?

229
00:09:03,988 --> 00:09:05,054
No, nothing.

230
00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:07,724
Is it possible he's still
in shock from the cold?

231
00:09:07,758 --> 00:09:09,993
I don't think so.

232
00:09:10,027 --> 00:09:11,394
I'll go see if his labs are back.

233
00:09:11,428 --> 00:09:13,229
That won't be necessary.

234
00:09:13,264 --> 00:09:14,898
He's addicted to heroin.

235
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,400
He's going through withdrawal.

236
00:09:19,901 --> 00:09:21,789
Shh.

237
00:09:25,182 --> 00:09:26,681
I heard about the baby.

238
00:09:26,716 --> 00:09:28,548
Neonatal abstinence syndrome.

239
00:09:28,573 --> 00:09:30,369
That's a... that's a rough road.

240
00:09:30,393 --> 00:09:32,160
Yeah, I'm giving him fluids, Ativan,

241
00:09:32,194 --> 00:09:33,892
and aspiration precautions,

242
00:09:33,917 --> 00:09:36,097
but his numbers aren't
getting any better.

243
00:09:36,132 --> 00:09:37,599
How's the mom?

244
00:09:37,633 --> 00:09:39,601
Just wants to get out
and get her next fix.

245
00:09:39,635 --> 00:09:40,635
Why?

246
00:09:40,669 --> 00:09:42,871
Studies show that babies
who are not thriving

247
00:09:42,905 --> 00:09:44,472
actually do significantly better

248
00:09:44,507 --> 00:09:45,640
when they have physical contact

249
00:09:45,674 --> 00:09:46,841
with their biological mothers.

250
00:09:46,892 --> 00:09:48,781
- So?
- So I think we should

251
00:09:48,806 --> 00:09:50,478
have LeAnn hold him for a little bit.

252
00:09:50,513 --> 00:09:51,859
You can't be serious.
She tried to kill him.

253
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:53,782
She would be supervised.

254
00:09:53,816 --> 00:09:55,483
Even hearing the mother's heartbeat

255
00:09:55,518 --> 00:09:57,318
can lower cortisol levels and stress.

256
00:09:57,353 --> 00:09:58,476
LeAnn had nine months

257
00:09:58,501 --> 00:10:00,221
to do right by her baby.
She lost that chance.

258
00:10:00,256 --> 00:10:02,342
- Dr. Charles...
- Well, I appreciate

259
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,958
your concern for your...
for your patient,

260
00:10:03,993 --> 00:10:06,127
Dr. Manning, but I'm also
concerned for mine,

261
00:10:06,162 --> 00:10:07,529
and here's the problem.

262
00:10:07,563 --> 00:10:09,798
That baby's going home
with somebody else.

263
00:10:09,832 --> 00:10:13,234
We let LeAnn bond with him,
and then just rip him away?

264
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:16,922
Any chance we have of helping
her... pretty much gone for good.

265
00:10:16,969 --> 00:10:19,671
Dr. Charles, we're talking
about an infant's life.

266
00:10:19,705 --> 00:10:21,606
I'm aware of that, but I just think that

267
00:10:21,641 --> 00:10:23,608
we should take a beat
and look at all sides of this.

268
00:10:23,643 --> 00:10:25,243
Excuse me, Dr. Manning.

269
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:26,912
DCFS is on their way.

270
00:10:26,946 --> 00:10:28,346
They've got some foster parents

271
00:10:28,381 --> 00:10:29,581
that might be interested

272
00:10:29,615 --> 00:10:31,416
in caring for your patient.

273
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,584
Good. Um, just have them

274
00:10:32,618 --> 00:10:33,818
give me a little bit of time.

275
00:10:33,853 --> 00:10:35,687
Okay? Um, the baby's not stable yet.

276
00:10:35,721 --> 00:10:39,090
- I'll do my best.
- Thank you.

277
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,526
Oh, hey, Sharon.

278
00:10:41,561 --> 00:10:43,495
Hello, Bert.

279
00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:45,664
Uh, how's Miss Dempsey doing?

280
00:10:45,698 --> 00:10:47,766
Well, hopefully,
we'll be out of here soon.

281
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,534
Dr. Halstead's on top of it.

282
00:10:49,569 --> 00:10:51,269
Well, that's good.

283
00:10:51,304 --> 00:10:52,804
And how are you doing?

284
00:10:52,838 --> 00:10:54,272
Me? I'm, you know, the same:

285
00:10:54,307 --> 00:10:57,275
hanging in there,
trying to help as best I can.

286
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:59,644
Well, I'm sure it isn't easy.

287
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:01,446
No, it isn't.

288
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,182
Watching her get
a little worse every day

289
00:11:04,217 --> 00:11:05,784
and struggling with the things

290
00:11:05,818 --> 00:11:10,055
that were easy
just a few weeks ago and...

291
00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:11,356
Ah.

292
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:14,192
Anyhow, I... I should get back.

293
00:11:14,227 --> 00:11:16,494
Yeah.

294
00:11:18,764 --> 00:11:20,332
Once you return to work,

295
00:11:20,366 --> 00:11:21,733
we'll round twice a day,

296
00:11:21,767 --> 00:11:23,301
do a chart review every morning,

297
00:11:23,336 --> 00:11:26,238
and you'll observe
group therapy every afternoon.

298
00:11:26,272 --> 00:11:28,340
By "observe," do you mean
I will be sitting in?

299
00:11:28,374 --> 00:11:30,642
No, we have a one-way mirror.

300
00:11:30,676 --> 00:11:33,979
I don't believe in using
house staff as cheap labor.

301
00:11:34,013 --> 00:11:35,413
You first.

302
00:11:35,448 --> 00:11:37,916
Residency is a time to watch

303
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,051
and absorb.

304
00:11:40,086 --> 00:11:41,987
Um, okay.

305
00:11:42,021 --> 00:11:43,655
Uh, though, speaking about therapy,

306
00:11:43,689 --> 00:11:45,991
I've been reading up on
Erikson's theories

307
00:11:46,025 --> 00:11:48,994
uh, for strategic interaction,
and it's an interesting take,

308
00:11:49,028 --> 00:11:50,996
focusing on a patient's, uh,
personal strengths,

309
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,597
rather than their pathologies.

310
00:11:52,632 --> 00:11:54,499
Yes, interactional therapy
is interesting, but

311
00:11:54,533 --> 00:11:56,534
you should spend the rest
of your suspension

312
00:11:56,569 --> 00:11:58,670
learning these.

313
00:11:58,704 --> 00:12:00,171
What are they?

314
00:12:00,206 --> 00:12:01,606
Treatment algorithms

315
00:12:01,641 --> 00:12:03,908
for the seven most common
conditions we see.

316
00:12:03,943 --> 00:12:05,777
But these are flow charts.

317
00:12:05,811 --> 00:12:07,612
How do you individualize the therapy?

318
00:12:07,647 --> 00:12:09,080
Step three.

319
00:12:09,115 --> 00:12:11,283
Is the patient responding to medication?

320
00:12:11,317 --> 00:12:14,052
Yes, no.

321
00:12:14,086 --> 00:12:16,354
Thursday afternoons, we do journal club.

322
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:19,157
You're welcome to listen in.

323
00:12:20,826 --> 00:12:22,894
- What happened?
- Building's condemned.

324
00:12:22,928 --> 00:12:24,229
Supposed to be empty,

325
00:12:24,263 --> 00:12:25,964
but we thought we heard somebody inside.

326
00:12:25,998 --> 00:12:27,532
Turned out to be a squatter.
Guy's name is Gary.

327
00:12:27,566 --> 00:12:28,767
He's got a big chunk of concrete

328
00:12:28,801 --> 00:12:30,368
compressing his left leg

329
00:12:30,403 --> 00:12:32,203
and a piece of rebar
straight up through his groin.

330
00:12:32,238 --> 00:12:33,872
We got pressure on it,
but he's bleeding pretty bad.

331
00:12:33,906 --> 00:12:35,106
If we stop the bleed,
can we get him out?

332
00:12:35,141 --> 00:12:37,208
- Hard to say.
- Hey, Lieutenant!

333
00:12:37,243 --> 00:12:39,711
- Yeah?
- Uh, the concrete's a bear.

334
00:12:39,745 --> 00:12:41,579
We can't use the bags on it,

335
00:12:41,614 --> 00:12:42,881
but we might be able to

336
00:12:42,915 --> 00:12:45,717
break it up with the air chisel.

337
00:12:45,751 --> 00:12:47,319
Be careful. We haven't been able to

338
00:12:47,353 --> 00:12:50,655
clear a path yet, so we're
gonna have to sneak through.

339
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:53,391
- Watch your heads.
- Yeah.

340
00:12:53,426 --> 00:12:55,126
Ah, here we go, Gary.

341
00:12:55,161 --> 00:12:56,728
We got Dr. Rhodes

342
00:12:56,762 --> 00:12:59,230
and Dr. Bekker.

343
00:12:59,265 --> 00:13:00,632
Now, Gary,

344
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:03,835
we're gonna take
good care of you, all right?

345
00:13:03,869 --> 00:13:07,939
All right. Hey, you're okay.

346
00:13:07,973 --> 00:13:09,140
All right, draw up
another round of labs,

347
00:13:09,175 --> 00:13:11,242
- and hang a gram of vanco.
- Yep.

348
00:13:11,277 --> 00:13:13,144
Hey, Ms. Dempsey.

349
00:13:13,179 --> 00:13:16,648
The antibiotics aren't
working, are they?

350
00:13:16,682 --> 00:13:18,450
No, they're not,

351
00:13:18,484 --> 00:13:20,185
and it's possible the bacteria

352
00:13:20,219 --> 00:13:23,321
has spread from your lungs
into your blood.

353
00:13:23,356 --> 00:13:25,657
Sepsis.

354
00:13:25,691 --> 00:13:27,659
I've been reading.

355
00:13:27,693 --> 00:13:29,260
Yes.

356
00:13:29,295 --> 00:13:31,863
Now, I'm hoping this
new antibiotic we're starting

357
00:13:31,897 --> 00:13:33,932
will turn things around,

358
00:13:33,966 --> 00:13:36,267
but, as you know, the supranuclear palsy

359
00:13:36,302 --> 00:13:37,936
makes your immune system less effective,

360
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,871
so there's also a chance
before we get there

361
00:13:39,905 --> 00:13:42,607
your lungs will start to give out.

362
00:13:42,641 --> 00:13:44,509
Now, if it comes to that,

363
00:13:44,543 --> 00:13:47,112
I am gonna have to intubate you.

364
00:13:47,146 --> 00:13:49,214
And put me on a ventilator?

365
00:13:49,248 --> 00:13:50,648
Yes.

366
00:13:50,683 --> 00:13:51,950
But hopefully, it's only temporary,

367
00:13:51,984 --> 00:13:53,618
until we can clear the infection.

368
00:13:55,688 --> 00:13:57,455
Okay?

369
00:13:59,358 --> 00:14:00,792
Hang in there.

370
00:14:00,826 --> 00:14:03,628
I'll be back to check on you
in a few minutes.

371
00:14:03,662 --> 00:14:05,296
Dr. Halstead?

372
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:11,169
I don't want that ventilator.

373
00:14:11,203 --> 00:14:13,538
I understand this sounds daunting,

374
00:14:13,572 --> 00:14:15,173
but like I said, if it comes to that,

375
00:14:15,207 --> 00:14:17,642
we may very well be able
to get you off it again soon.

376
00:14:17,676 --> 00:14:19,878
Or you may not.

377
00:14:19,912 --> 00:14:22,247
I know how this all ends.

378
00:14:22,281 --> 00:14:24,182
Lyla,

379
00:14:24,216 --> 00:14:26,718
if your lungs fail and I don't intubate,

380
00:14:26,752 --> 00:14:28,553
you'll die.

381
00:14:30,256 --> 00:14:32,724
I know.

382
00:14:35,861 --> 00:14:37,662
Okay.

383
00:14:42,768 --> 00:14:44,669
Ms. Crawford?

384
00:14:44,703 --> 00:14:46,371
I told you, I don't want to talk.

385
00:14:46,405 --> 00:14:48,373
Uh, I'm not here to discuss detox.

386
00:14:48,407 --> 00:14:51,363
I want to talk to you about your baby.

387
00:14:51,388 --> 00:14:52,544
What about it?

388
00:14:52,578 --> 00:14:54,777
He's a boy,

389
00:14:54,947 --> 00:14:57,137
and he's withdrawing from heroin.

390
00:14:57,283 --> 00:15:00,098
He's, um, not eating, not sleeping.

391
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:04,722
Breathing and heartbeat aren't
quite as regular as we'd like.

392
00:15:04,757 --> 00:15:06,858
So give him some medicine.

393
00:15:06,892 --> 00:15:08,693
Well, we have been, but...

394
00:15:08,727 --> 00:15:11,262
it is not quite that simple.

395
00:15:11,297 --> 00:15:13,631
Okay.

396
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,900
Um...

397
00:15:18,337 --> 00:15:19,804
So?

398
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,606
LeAnn, adults have years

399
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,475
to develop the coping mechanisms

400
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:27,078
that helps us get through
life's trouble spots.

401
00:15:27,112 --> 00:15:29,047
Uh, a newborn doesn't have any.

402
00:15:29,081 --> 00:15:31,149
You know, for him, his mother

403
00:15:31,183 --> 00:15:32,817
is the only thing in the world

404
00:15:32,852 --> 00:15:34,652
that makes him feel safe.

405
00:15:34,687 --> 00:15:36,054
Being held by her,

406
00:15:36,088 --> 00:15:39,057
you know, feeling her skin...

407
00:15:39,091 --> 00:15:41,759
You want me to hold him?

408
00:15:41,794 --> 00:15:43,428
Well, it might be

409
00:15:43,462 --> 00:15:44,896
the best medicine we've got.

410
00:15:49,368 --> 00:15:50,969
I-I-I don't...

411
00:15:51,003 --> 00:15:53,071
I don't know how to hold a baby.

412
00:15:53,105 --> 00:15:54,239
Well, we can show you.

413
00:15:54,273 --> 00:15:57,141
We can teach you how to do that.

414
00:15:57,176 --> 00:15:58,226
But...

415
00:15:58,251 --> 00:16:01,876
this baby's sick 'cause of me, right?

416
00:16:02,481 --> 00:16:04,949
There's... there's no way
that more of me

417
00:16:04,984 --> 00:16:07,318
is gonna help it.

418
00:16:07,353 --> 00:16:09,187
Well...

419
00:16:09,221 --> 00:16:11,256
I said no.

420
00:16:13,158 --> 00:16:15,693
Please leave me alone.

421
00:16:27,973 --> 00:16:30,775
Ms. Dempsey?

422
00:16:30,809 --> 00:16:33,111
You wanted to see me?

423
00:16:33,145 --> 00:16:35,613
What can I do for you?

424
00:16:35,648 --> 00:16:39,317
I'm sure I'm the last person
you want to talk to.

425
00:16:39,351 --> 00:16:40,652
I know Bert

426
00:16:40,686 --> 00:16:42,787
didn't do right by you,

427
00:16:42,821 --> 00:16:44,722
but he's a good man.

428
00:16:44,757 --> 00:16:46,724
He shouldn't be alone.

429
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:51,462
Well, he was fortunate
to have found you.

430
00:16:51,497 --> 00:16:53,965
Thank you.

431
00:16:53,999 --> 00:16:58,236
But he won't have me for long.

432
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:02,473
I signed a do-not-resuscitate order.

433
00:17:02,508 --> 00:17:06,477
I see.

434
00:17:06,512 --> 00:17:09,981
So when my time does come,

435
00:17:10,015 --> 00:17:12,383
would you look after him?

436
00:17:12,418 --> 00:17:14,819
You don't have to answer now. Just...

437
00:17:14,853 --> 00:17:17,989
please think about it.

438
00:17:28,534 --> 00:17:31,102
Let's see what we got here, all right?

439
00:17:33,205 --> 00:17:36,507
Wait, hold pressure, hold pressure.

440
00:17:36,542 --> 00:17:39,377
- All right.
- There.

441
00:17:39,411 --> 00:17:43,348
- Yep.
- Move your hands.

442
00:17:43,382 --> 00:17:45,016
Just a bit.

443
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:46,517
Can you see it?

444
00:17:48,053 --> 00:17:49,854
No, can't clamp the artery.

445
00:17:49,888 --> 00:17:51,522
Rebar's in the way.

446
00:17:51,557 --> 00:17:54,092
Herrmann, any chance
of getting him out of here?

447
00:17:54,126 --> 00:17:55,627
We're gonna try the air chisels,

448
00:17:55,661 --> 00:17:57,895
but it don't look good.

449
00:18:00,933 --> 00:18:02,700
All right, we're gonna
have to do a REBOA.

450
00:18:02,735 --> 00:18:03,801
What?

451
00:18:03,836 --> 00:18:05,036
Gary?

452
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,771
An ER-REBOA is a catheter

453
00:18:06,805 --> 00:18:09,207
with a balloon at the tip that
I can thread into your aorta.

454
00:18:09,241 --> 00:18:11,943
Once I inflate the balloon,

455
00:18:11,977 --> 00:18:13,578
it'll keep you from bleeding.

456
00:18:13,612 --> 00:18:15,480
Okay.

457
00:18:15,514 --> 00:18:16,748
One moment.

458
00:18:16,782 --> 00:18:18,249
- Ready.
- Keep pressure there.

459
00:18:18,283 --> 00:18:20,752
Got it. Yep, hang on.

460
00:18:20,786 --> 00:18:22,787
Watch it. Hang on, bud.

461
00:18:22,821 --> 00:18:25,056
Connor, we can't do that.

462
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,591
Once you inflate the balloon,

463
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,059
we'll only have 30 minutes
to get him out of here.

464
00:18:28,093 --> 00:18:29,927
He's lost too much blood already.

465
00:18:29,954 --> 00:18:32,397
It's gonna take a lot of
movement to get him out of here,

466
00:18:32,431 --> 00:18:34,098
and we won't be able
to maintain pressure.

467
00:18:34,133 --> 00:18:35,466
So you're going to risk

468
00:18:35,501 --> 00:18:37,001
prolonged loss of circulation instead?

469
00:18:37,036 --> 00:18:38,936
I realize it can necessitate amputation,

470
00:18:38,971 --> 00:18:40,738
but I promise you,

471
00:18:40,773 --> 00:18:42,106
if we don't place a REBOA,

472
00:18:42,141 --> 00:18:43,808
he's going to bleed out
right in front of us.

473
00:18:43,842 --> 00:18:45,076
Hey.

474
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,844
- Yeah?
- Hey, what's going on?

475
00:18:46,879 --> 00:18:48,613
Nothing, Gary.

476
00:18:48,647 --> 00:18:52,293
We're gonna get you out of here
as fast as we can.

477
00:18:52,484 --> 00:18:53,751
Okay.

478
00:18:53,894 --> 00:18:55,586
Okay.

479
00:18:58,624 --> 00:19:00,925
Easy.

480
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:06,369
Easy. Just breathe, buddy.

481
00:19:07,066 --> 00:19:08,939
Hang in there.

482
00:19:09,369 --> 00:19:11,637
All right, here we go.

483
00:19:20,836 --> 00:19:22,597
Come in.

484
00:19:24,783 --> 00:19:26,483
Dr. Reese.

485
00:19:26,651 --> 00:19:29,611
How'd it go with Dr. Chapman?

486
00:19:29,921 --> 00:19:31,588
Uh, it was fine.

487
00:19:31,623 --> 00:19:32,823
She's fine.

488
00:19:32,962 --> 00:19:34,501
Good.

489
00:19:35,095 --> 00:19:37,681
Is there an issue?

490
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,275
I prefer to come back to your service.

491
00:19:42,634 --> 00:19:45,502
I understand, really, I do,

492
00:19:45,537 --> 00:19:48,135
but I-I think it's very
important that you explore

493
00:19:48,323 --> 00:19:50,941
a different clinical approach.

494
00:19:50,975 --> 00:19:53,677
Yeah, well, Dr. Charles,
I'm not an idiot.

495
00:19:53,712 --> 00:19:58,115
Um, I know you think my anxiety,

496
00:19:58,281 --> 00:19:59,849
my PTSD, if you will,

497
00:19:59,882 --> 00:20:02,397
stems directly from your being shot,

498
00:20:02,421 --> 00:20:03,788
that our working together is

499
00:20:03,823 --> 00:20:05,896
negatively affecting my mental health...

500
00:20:07,927 --> 00:20:09,394
But...

501
00:20:09,428 --> 00:20:11,462
first of all, um,

502
00:20:11,552 --> 00:20:15,676
these are my issues,
and I'm working on them,

503
00:20:16,168 --> 00:20:18,168
and second of all,

504
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:21,906
you chose to bring me into psychiatry...

505
00:20:23,609 --> 00:20:25,977
So I'm not about to let you pawn me off

506
00:20:26,011 --> 00:20:27,745
onto that Dr. Chapman...

507
00:20:29,114 --> 00:20:32,217
When you're the psychiatrist
I want to be.

508
00:20:36,622 --> 00:20:39,724
Um... I mean, I-I almost lost you once.

509
00:20:39,758 --> 00:20:42,894
I-I don't want to lose you again.

510
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:47,398
Oh. I...

511
00:20:47,433 --> 00:20:49,500
I very much appreciate

512
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,902
what you're saying,

513
00:20:50,936 --> 00:20:52,503
but as a... as a clinician,

514
00:20:52,538 --> 00:20:53,938
- and as a...
- Dr. Charles...

515
00:20:53,973 --> 00:20:57,842
And as a teacher,
I just think that this is

516
00:20:57,877 --> 00:21:01,279
the best course of action
that we stick with Dr. Chapman.

517
00:21:09,421 --> 00:21:10,722
Bert, stop.

518
00:21:10,756 --> 00:21:12,757
Sweetheart, this isn't right. No.

519
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,959
Mr. Goodwin, it's not up to me.

520
00:21:14,994 --> 00:21:16,628
Bert, please...

521
00:21:16,662 --> 00:21:20,398
How can you not do anything?

522
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,034
I explained all her options.

523
00:21:23,068 --> 00:21:24,435
But you're her doctor.

524
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,703
Tell her what's best.

525
00:21:25,738 --> 00:21:26,771
She made her wishes very clear.

526
00:21:26,805 --> 00:21:28,573
There's nothing else I can do.

527
00:21:28,607 --> 00:21:30,742
So you're just going to
stand around and let her die?

528
00:21:30,776 --> 00:21:32,143
What the hell kind of hospital is this?

529
00:21:32,177 --> 00:21:34,412
- Bert, Bert...
- Bert.

530
00:21:34,446 --> 00:21:37,315
Bert.

531
00:21:37,349 --> 00:21:38,816
She needs another doctor,

532
00:21:38,851 --> 00:21:40,652
one who will do something
if she gets worse.

533
00:21:40,686 --> 00:21:42,387
Bert, this is her choice.

534
00:21:42,421 --> 00:21:43,755
She's got a fever.

535
00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:45,323
She doesn't know what she wants.

536
00:21:45,357 --> 00:21:46,991
This is hard, I know,

537
00:21:47,026 --> 00:21:48,459
but Dr. Halstead

538
00:21:48,494 --> 00:21:50,495
is doing everything he can

539
00:21:50,529 --> 00:21:52,830
within the scope of Lyla's wishes.

540
00:21:52,865 --> 00:21:55,433
The best thing you can do right now

541
00:21:55,467 --> 00:21:57,335
is go back in that room

542
00:21:57,369 --> 00:22:00,405
and be with her.

543
00:22:07,479 --> 00:22:10,415
How are you feeling?

544
00:22:10,449 --> 00:22:12,083
Fine.

545
00:22:17,723 --> 00:22:21,359
You don't think I should
go see my baby, do you?

546
00:22:21,393 --> 00:22:24,128
That's up to you.

547
00:22:25,564 --> 00:22:28,800
They say he's sick.

548
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:34,706
Yeah, he is.

549
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,875
I never planned on getting pregnant.

550
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:40,511
You know?

551
00:22:43,248 --> 00:22:45,984
Whatever.

552
00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:50,688
You think I'm terrible.

553
00:22:50,723 --> 00:22:52,056
I just wish things had

554
00:22:52,091 --> 00:22:55,593
worked out differently
for you and your baby.

555
00:22:58,897 --> 00:23:01,799
Yeah.

556
00:23:01,834 --> 00:23:03,401
But I guess where you're from,

557
00:23:03,435 --> 00:23:06,738
things work out great for everybody.

558
00:23:06,772 --> 00:23:10,241
Why would you understand?

559
00:23:10,275 --> 00:23:13,711
Actually, I understand
a lot better than you think.

560
00:23:18,117 --> 00:23:19,417
Oh.

561
00:23:19,451 --> 00:23:21,252
Getting hungry yet?

562
00:23:21,286 --> 00:23:25,056
I know you think
this is charming, but it's not.

563
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:27,425
Hey, you remember our first date?

564
00:23:27,459 --> 00:23:29,594
Mm-hmm. Mexican food...

565
00:23:29,628 --> 00:23:31,896
- at the mall.
- No, I mean afterwards.

566
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:34,499
We were throwing pennies into the pond

567
00:23:34,533 --> 00:23:36,167
where people made wishes.

568
00:23:36,201 --> 00:23:37,835
You know what mine was?

569
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:39,704
A second date with the pretty woman

570
00:23:39,738 --> 00:23:40,772
sitting next to me.

571
00:23:40,806 --> 00:23:43,408
Hm. That's a sweet story.

572
00:23:43,442 --> 00:23:45,676
Too bad it ends
with you cheating on her.

573
00:23:45,711 --> 00:23:49,047
- I've changed, Maggie.
- So you say.

574
00:23:49,081 --> 00:23:52,984
But this time, I'm smart enough
to draw the line.

575
00:23:53,986 --> 00:23:57,188
- Maggie, just...
- Barry...

576
00:23:58,924 --> 00:24:01,092
Okay.

577
00:24:22,681 --> 00:24:24,248
We're good. Keep going.

578
00:24:24,283 --> 00:24:26,451
This place is unstable.
Another shift like that,

579
00:24:26,485 --> 00:24:28,719
and the whole thing's
going to come down, Rhodes.

580
00:24:28,754 --> 00:24:30,154
Guys, you gotta do something.

581
00:24:30,189 --> 00:24:31,823
We could try coming from another angle,

582
00:24:31,857 --> 00:24:33,558
but it'll take 20 minutes.

583
00:24:35,961 --> 00:24:37,728
His leg's already cold.

584
00:24:37,763 --> 00:24:38,996
All it's doing now is preventing us

585
00:24:39,031 --> 00:24:40,431
from getting him to hospital.

586
00:24:41,867 --> 00:24:43,601
Yeah.

587
00:24:46,605 --> 00:24:48,439
Gary...

588
00:24:48,474 --> 00:24:50,441
listen to me.

589
00:24:50,476 --> 00:24:52,009
Your leg is trapped

590
00:24:52,044 --> 00:24:53,845
and we need to get you out of here.

591
00:24:53,879 --> 00:24:55,513
I'm afraid that the only way to do that

592
00:24:55,547 --> 00:24:57,648
is to amputate.

593
00:24:57,683 --> 00:25:00,118
What? No.

594
00:25:00,152 --> 00:25:01,152
Gary, I'm very sorry,

595
00:25:01,186 --> 00:25:03,855
but your leg has gone
without blood for too long.

596
00:25:03,889 --> 00:25:05,523
Is that 'cause of that thing
you put in me?

597
00:25:05,557 --> 00:25:06,757
That balloon?

598
00:25:06,792 --> 00:25:08,192
We had to do that so you wouldn't

599
00:25:08,227 --> 00:25:09,961
lose even more blood,
but now that it's in,

600
00:25:09,995 --> 00:25:11,362
every minute puts you in more danger.

601
00:25:11,396 --> 00:25:12,530
- No.
- Gary...

602
00:25:12,564 --> 00:25:14,165
- Dr. Rhodes...
- Get away!

603
00:25:14,199 --> 00:25:17,535
Gary, listen to me.

604
00:25:17,569 --> 00:25:19,537
I do not want you to die.

605
00:25:19,571 --> 00:25:21,038
We have to get you to hospital.

606
00:25:21,073 --> 00:25:22,140
Do you understand?

607
00:25:22,174 --> 00:25:25,676
You are not taking my leg.

608
00:25:25,711 --> 00:25:27,845
I wish we didn't have to,

609
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,514
but you've lost a lot of blood

610
00:25:29,548 --> 00:25:31,849
and you are in grave danger.

611
00:25:31,884 --> 00:25:34,485
You can't.

612
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,786
Please.

613
00:25:35,821 --> 00:25:37,388
There's gotta be another way.

614
00:25:37,422 --> 00:25:38,689
I'm sorry,

615
00:25:38,724 --> 00:25:40,625
there isn't.

616
00:25:40,659 --> 00:25:43,027
And I know how terrible this seems,

617
00:25:43,061 --> 00:25:45,029
but you have a lot of years to live

618
00:25:45,063 --> 00:25:47,131
and a lot of life to experience,

619
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:49,446
and I don't want you
to miss out on that,

620
00:25:49,535 --> 00:25:50,735
but you will

621
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:52,403
unless you let us help you

622
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:53,759
right now.

623
00:25:53,872 --> 00:25:56,712
But it's my leg.

624
00:25:57,442 --> 00:25:58,676
I can't...

625
00:26:01,246 --> 00:26:02,747
You can.

626
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:07,318
Good.

627
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:15,593
Now, Dr. Rhodes is going to numb you up.

628
00:26:15,627 --> 00:26:18,036
After that, you won't feel anything.

629
00:26:19,531 --> 00:26:21,693
Just keep looking at me, Gary.

630
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,267
I've got you.

631
00:26:42,221 --> 00:26:43,254
Gah!

632
00:26:46,797 --> 00:26:48,496
Dr. Manning.

633
00:26:50,046 --> 00:26:52,054
- What's happening?
- He's having a seizure.

634
00:26:52,234 --> 00:26:54,002
Give him a bolus of Ativan.

635
00:26:54,101 --> 00:26:56,075
O2 sats are down to 72.

636
00:26:56,106 --> 00:26:57,207
He can't get any air.

637
00:26:57,232 --> 00:26:59,005
Bolus is in.

638
00:26:59,401 --> 00:27:01,369
He could suffer an anoxic brain injury.

639
00:27:01,505 --> 00:27:04,238
Give him 0.1 milligrams of morphine.

640
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:13,973
Stats down to 67.

641
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:17,410
He can't go much longer.
Give him another 0.1.

642
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,558
Sats back to 77.

643
00:27:31,592 --> 00:27:33,359
81.

644
00:27:33,394 --> 00:27:34,661
He's breathing.

645
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:36,380
Get a pediatric intubation kit.

646
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:37,397
Is this happens again, we're going to

647
00:27:37,431 --> 00:27:39,499
have to put him on a vent.

648
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,007
Right.

649
00:27:48,042 --> 00:27:51,578
You have a very expressive face.

650
00:27:51,612 --> 00:27:53,079
Easy to read.

651
00:27:53,113 --> 00:27:57,083
I'm not sure that's a good thing.

652
00:27:57,117 --> 00:28:00,755
When I told Bert
that I was terminally ill,

653
00:28:01,185 --> 00:28:04,614
my greatest fear was
that he would leave me.

654
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:08,194
We had only been dating
a couple of months.

655
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:18,204
But he didn't. He stuck with me

656
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:20,139
through thick and thin.

657
00:28:20,174 --> 00:28:23,476
He doesn't deserve
to have me leave him now.

658
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:26,045
So if you need to take extreme measures

659
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,081
to keep me alive,

660
00:28:28,115 --> 00:28:32,552
do it.

661
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:35,255
Are you sure?

662
00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:36,923
Yes.

663
00:28:36,957 --> 00:28:38,491
And you understand that means

664
00:28:38,525 --> 00:28:41,461
I may need to intubate you very soon?

665
00:28:41,495 --> 00:28:43,129
I promise,

666
00:28:43,163 --> 00:28:46,299
this is my decision...

667
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:48,134
Not his.

668
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:52,739
Okay.

669
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:55,775
I'll go change the order.

670
00:29:01,282 --> 00:29:03,416
And he's gonna die.

671
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,286
He could, yeah.

672
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,654
And you... you really think

673
00:29:07,688 --> 00:29:09,589
that having me hold him is gonna help?

674
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:11,090
I know it's a lot to ask,

675
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:12,759
and I-I just wouldn't be doing it

676
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:15,828
if the situation wasn't so dire,

677
00:29:15,863 --> 00:29:18,264
but you're his mother,
and... and the baby needs you,

678
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:19,966
and I... if there's any chance at all

679
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,436
that your holding him might
help him get better,

680
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,706
I think we should try.

681
00:29:29,343 --> 00:29:31,611
This was my... my fault.

682
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:37,450
I did this to him.

683
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:49,062
Okay.

684
00:29:49,096 --> 00:29:51,164
Okay.

685
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,651
He's so small.

686
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:13,419
Go ahead.

687
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:25,732
Hold him close, now.

688
00:30:25,766 --> 00:30:27,834
Against your skin.

689
00:30:29,937 --> 00:30:32,705
Hi. Don't cry.

690
00:30:47,755 --> 00:30:51,858
Hi. Hi, yeah?

691
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:53,559
Dr. Halstead?

692
00:30:57,765 --> 00:30:59,365
She's in SVT. 20 of etomidate,

693
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,034
50 of cisatracurium.

694
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:02,702
Grab the intubation kit
and charge the paddles to 25.

695
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:04,137
What's happening?

696
00:31:04,171 --> 00:31:05,805
The infection's overwhelming her system.

697
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:07,373
She rescinded her DNR, so I have to

698
00:31:07,408 --> 00:31:09,542
shock her heart back
into rhythm and intubate.

699
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,411
Mr. Goodwin, I need you to step back.

700
00:31:11,445 --> 00:31:14,981
She's doing this for me, isn't she?

701
00:31:15,015 --> 00:31:17,450
She... she doesn't want this. Stop.

702
00:31:17,484 --> 00:31:19,552
Stop.

703
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:20,820
Lyla.

704
00:31:20,854 --> 00:31:22,588
Lyla, this is a shockable rhythm.

705
00:31:22,623 --> 00:31:24,924
I can try to resuscitate you.
Do you want me to do that?

706
00:31:29,163 --> 00:31:30,129
No.

707
00:31:30,164 --> 00:31:31,664
You heard her. You heard her.

708
00:31:31,698 --> 00:31:32,899
Don't do this.

709
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:34,834
Don't...

710
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:46,312
I love you.

711
00:31:48,449 --> 00:31:50,450
I love you.

712
00:32:31,492 --> 00:32:32,658
Baghdad.

713
00:32:32,693 --> 00:32:33,793
All right, Karen,

714
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:34,894
tell the OR we're on our way up

715
00:32:34,928 --> 00:32:36,229
as soon as this rebar's out.

716
00:32:36,263 --> 00:32:37,797
100 milligrams of ketamine.

717
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:39,398
Get me a cut-down kit.

718
00:32:39,433 --> 00:32:42,335
And hang two units of
O neg on the rapid transfuser.

719
00:32:45,372 --> 00:32:46,706
On my count.

720
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:49,809
One, two, three.

721
00:32:49,843 --> 00:32:51,577
All right. Thanks, guys.

722
00:32:57,885 --> 00:32:59,485
Is that a REBOA?

723
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,154
Couldn't get it down in the ambo.

724
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:03,055
Pressure tanked every time I tried.

725
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:04,724
Of course it does. A REBOA in the field

726
00:33:04,758 --> 00:33:05,992
is a problem waiting to happen.

727
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:08,327
- Whose idea was this?
- Mine.

728
00:33:08,362 --> 00:33:10,329
- Dr. Rhodes, do you realize...
- It was the right call.

729
00:33:10,364 --> 00:33:12,899
There was no other way
to get him out of there alive.

730
00:33:15,269 --> 00:33:16,836
All right, wound looks good.

731
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:17,837
Taking down the REBOA.

732
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:21,073
Watch the pressure.

733
00:33:21,108 --> 00:33:23,109
Pressure's holding.

734
00:33:23,143 --> 00:33:24,744
Vitals are stable.

735
00:33:24,778 --> 00:33:25,778
All right, let's get this thing out

736
00:33:25,812 --> 00:33:27,380
and get him up to the OR.

737
00:33:27,414 --> 00:33:29,015
Ready?

738
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:31,951
- Yep.
- One, two, three.

739
00:33:39,793 --> 00:33:43,529
No bleeding. Let's go.

740
00:33:43,564 --> 00:33:44,697
Nice job, Dr. Rhodes.

741
00:34:04,785 --> 00:34:07,920
- Yes, that's it.
- Right there.

742
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:11,924
Oh, excuse me.

743
00:34:11,959 --> 00:34:13,159
Can I just have a quick word

744
00:34:13,193 --> 00:34:14,627
with... with Ms. Crawford first?

745
00:34:14,661 --> 00:34:16,929
Okay.

746
00:34:18,865 --> 00:34:21,100
Hey.

747
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:24,237
Oh, wow, he looks great.

748
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:26,505
A lot better, huh?

749
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,907
He is great.

750
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:29,275
So, um,

751
00:34:29,309 --> 00:34:31,077
we have finally made some room for him

752
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:32,778
in the intensive care unit,

753
00:34:32,813 --> 00:34:35,414
so we're gonna... we're gonna
take him up there now.

754
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:36,816
Okay.

755
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:38,317
Oh, do I carry him up,

756
00:34:38,352 --> 00:34:42,488
or do we take him up in the warmer?

757
00:34:42,522 --> 00:34:44,257
Well, um...

758
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:45,691
Actually, LeAnn, there is a...

759
00:34:45,726 --> 00:34:48,761
there's a... there's
a foster couple up there

760
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:52,498
who is gonna be looking
after him from here on out.

761
00:34:57,371 --> 00:34:59,105
But he likes me so much.

762
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:00,139
I know.

763
00:35:00,173 --> 00:35:03,609
And he is doing so well.

764
00:35:03,644 --> 00:35:05,044
So... so I should

765
00:35:05,078 --> 00:35:06,612
just keep holding him.

766
00:35:06,647 --> 00:35:08,447
I really wish you could.

767
00:35:08,482 --> 00:35:09,715
Really, I do.

768
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,651
But you said that he needs me.

769
00:35:11,685 --> 00:35:14,353
I know. I know I did.

770
00:35:14,388 --> 00:35:17,690
I know how difficult this is.
I really do.

771
00:35:17,724 --> 00:35:20,793
I'm sorry, but
we need to take the baby now.

772
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:23,018
No!

773
00:35:24,097 --> 00:35:26,032
I'm his mother!

774
00:35:26,066 --> 00:35:28,167
I'm... I'm his mother.

775
00:35:28,201 --> 00:35:30,136
Doctor... Dr. Charles, please...

776
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,671
- I'm sorry.
- You know.

777
00:35:31,705 --> 00:35:32,872
You know. Dr. Charles,

778
00:35:32,906 --> 00:35:34,240
please, can you help me? Please!

779
00:35:34,274 --> 00:35:35,474
- I'm sorry.
- Please, can you help me?

780
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:37,576
Please explain. That is my baby.

781
00:35:37,611 --> 00:35:39,312
Dr. Charles, please.

782
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:42,581
Please, can you just...
Dr. Charles, can you please...

783
00:35:46,875 --> 00:35:48,906
I saw Bert.

784
00:35:49,176 --> 00:35:50,682
He's taking it pretty hard.

785
00:35:50,729 --> 00:35:54,533
Yeah, I'm gonna send the kids
over to check on him.

786
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,010
Mm.

787
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,384
What?

788
00:35:58,419 --> 00:36:01,448
Sharon, do you think people can change?

789
00:36:05,683 --> 00:36:07,956
Maggie, I don't know.

790
00:36:09,363 --> 00:36:11,532
Go call my kids.

791
00:36:18,372 --> 00:36:19,869
LeAnn...

792
00:36:19,986 --> 00:36:23,016
you lost a lot of blood today.
I'd really rather you stay.

793
00:36:23,066 --> 00:36:25,267
Listen, it may not feel like it,

794
00:36:25,326 --> 00:36:26,593
but you did the right thing today.

795
00:36:26,636 --> 00:36:28,237
You were there for your baby.

796
00:36:28,271 --> 00:36:30,906
It's unfortunate
that you can't take him home,

797
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,142
but there's a methadone clinic
right upstairs.

798
00:36:33,176 --> 00:36:34,476
We can help you get cleaned up,

799
00:36:34,511 --> 00:36:35,778
and if you can get back on your feet,

800
00:36:35,812 --> 00:36:37,579
that's the crucial first step

801
00:36:37,614 --> 00:36:38,914
in getting him back.

802
00:36:38,948 --> 00:36:41,517
I'm tired.

803
00:36:41,551 --> 00:36:42,951
You know, I'm...

804
00:36:43,288 --> 00:36:46,046
I'm just gonna go.

805
00:36:46,556 --> 00:36:47,944
LeAnn...

806
00:36:48,124 --> 00:36:49,591
LeAnn.

807
00:36:52,629 --> 00:36:54,163
We had no choice. We had to do

808
00:36:54,197 --> 00:36:56,833
- what's right for the baby.
- Oh, yeah, of course.

809
00:36:57,066 --> 00:36:58,834
It's just, you know...

810
00:36:58,868 --> 00:37:01,804
It's sad.
It's unlikely either of them...

811
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:04,606
ever really be whole again.

812
00:37:11,581 --> 00:37:15,617
Ah, the old Chapman flow charts.

813
00:37:15,652 --> 00:37:17,286
Oh, yeah.

814
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,822
Number seven. That there's a doozy.

815
00:37:19,856 --> 00:37:22,457
Step seven?

816
00:37:24,861 --> 00:37:27,729
Dr. Reese, the truth is,

817
00:37:27,764 --> 00:37:31,033
I feel responsible
for letting your situation get

818
00:37:31,067 --> 00:37:33,068
out of hand the way it did.

819
00:37:33,102 --> 00:37:36,305
It was my job to, well, guide you

820
00:37:36,339 --> 00:37:39,727
and teach you and make you
a better doctor, and I...

821
00:37:39,909 --> 00:37:40,976
I let you down.

822
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:43,178
- Dr. Charles...
- But ultimately,

823
00:37:43,213 --> 00:37:46,511
some relationships are just better...

824
00:37:47,654 --> 00:37:49,155
kept intact,

825
00:37:49,252 --> 00:37:51,486
which is why, if you'd still like to,

826
00:37:51,521 --> 00:37:52,988
when you return,

827
00:37:53,022 --> 00:37:55,858
I would very much
welcome you back on my service.

828
00:37:57,694 --> 00:38:00,329
Really?

829
00:38:00,363 --> 00:38:02,030
Really.

830
00:38:09,639 --> 00:38:11,874
Hey, Gary.

831
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:17,880
How you doing?

832
00:38:17,914 --> 00:38:20,382
It's weird.

833
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,017
I can feel it,

834
00:38:22,051 --> 00:38:23,518
like it's still there.

835
00:38:23,553 --> 00:38:26,455
Yeah, it's called phantom limb pain.

836
00:38:26,489 --> 00:38:27,856
Uh...

837
00:38:27,891 --> 00:38:31,326
takes some time, but it will fade.

838
00:38:34,564 --> 00:38:37,099
Listen, Gary, I am...

839
00:38:37,133 --> 00:38:40,469
I am very sorry about your leg.

840
00:38:42,772 --> 00:38:45,908
At least I'm still alive.

841
00:38:48,578 --> 00:38:50,879
I'll find a way to move on.

842
00:38:54,117 --> 00:38:55,817
All right, bud.

843
00:38:55,852 --> 00:38:58,553
I'll check on you soon.

844
00:39:07,697 --> 00:39:10,599
Dr. Charles.

845
00:39:10,633 --> 00:39:13,602
I didn't want to believe
that it was over,

846
00:39:13,636 --> 00:39:16,805
but you were right.
I need to let Robin go.

847
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,257
April?

848
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:37,526
Hmm?

849
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,094
Who's that?

850
00:39:41,564 --> 00:39:42,831
It's my sister.

851
00:39:42,865 --> 00:39:44,766
What?

852
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:47,002
Emily.

853
00:39:47,036 --> 00:39:49,304
I should've told you.

854
00:39:49,339 --> 00:39:52,975
I never talk about her. It's painful.

855
00:39:53,009 --> 00:39:56,778
My parents adopted Emily
when she was four.

856
00:39:56,813 --> 00:39:59,982
She had a hard life
before she even came to us.

857
00:40:00,016 --> 00:40:01,283
Still does.

858
00:40:01,317 --> 00:40:04,119
She makes bad decisions, acts out,

859
00:40:04,153 --> 00:40:05,620
then blows up when I try to help her,

860
00:40:05,655 --> 00:40:07,055
and I swore the last time
that I wouldn't

861
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:08,957
let myself get involved again.

862
00:40:08,992 --> 00:40:11,960
When was that?

863
00:40:11,995 --> 00:40:14,463
It was four years ago.

864
00:40:19,836 --> 00:40:22,037
Maybe I should give her a call.

865
00:40:26,709 --> 00:40:28,210
Hey.

866
00:40:28,244 --> 00:40:31,713
Thank you for today. Uh, you were great.

867
00:40:31,748 --> 00:40:35,684
I did feel a bit like
Bonnie Henna out there.

868
00:40:35,718 --> 00:40:36,985
Who?

869
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,821
South African action hero.

870
00:40:39,856 --> 00:40:41,089
Have a good night.

871
00:40:41,124 --> 00:40:42,924
Oh, and no need to cover for me
tomorrow.

872
00:40:42,959 --> 00:40:44,326
I'll be here.

873
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,861
You're not going to Minneapolis?

874
00:40:45,895 --> 00:40:47,696
Nope.

875
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:00,208
Good evening, sir. Can I help you?

876
00:41:00,243 --> 00:41:02,711
I'm looking for a change.

877
00:41:02,745 --> 00:41:04,513
What model is this?

878
00:41:04,547 --> 00:41:05,847
The 911 4S.

879
00:41:05,882 --> 00:41:07,904
Beautiful car.

880
00:41:09,552 --> 00:41:11,520
Yes, it is.

881
00:41:11,821 --> 00:41:12,954
You got the keys?

882
00:41:12,989 --> 00:41:14,289
I'm sorry, but we're actually

883
00:41:14,323 --> 00:41:17,177
done doing test drives for the night.

884
00:41:17,293 --> 00:41:20,794
I don't want to test drive.
I want to buy it.

885
00:41:20,856 --> 00:41:24,395
Oh, of course. Just give me a moment.

886
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,941
Mm.

887
00:41:36,913 --> 00:41:39,629
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Mm.

888
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:41,483
No.

889
00:41:41,508 --> 00:41:43,987
You should stay.

890
00:41:44,754 --> 00:41:46,955
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

891
00:41:46,989 --> 00:41:48,557
What about Owen?

892
00:41:48,591 --> 00:41:50,058
Mm.

893
00:41:50,093 --> 00:41:52,594
He's got to find out sometime.

894
00:41:52,628 --> 00:41:53,895
Are you sure?

895
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:56,403
Mm-hmm. I'm sure.

896
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:00,262
This is so much better than
scraping ice off my windshield.
