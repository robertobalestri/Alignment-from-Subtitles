1
00:00:05,995 --> 00:00:08,463
<i>The body is a bundle of possibility.</i>

2
00:00:10,633 --> 00:00:13,001
<i>Every time we cut one open,</i>
<i>we're faced</i>

3
00:00:13,002 --> 00:00:17,205
<i>with a series of decisions.</i>

4
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:26,047
<i>Some choices are made for you.</i>

5
00:00:26,048 --> 00:00:27,765
You don't have to knock.

6
00:00:27,766 --> 00:00:29,951
Morning.

7
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:31,686
How'd you sleep?

8
00:00:31,687 --> 00:00:33,154
I'm not doing this another night...

9
00:00:33,155 --> 00:00:34,589
not sleeping on
that damn couch again.

10
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:35,723
Great. You shouldn't.

11
00:00:35,724 --> 00:00:37,124
You've got a perfectly fine
bed right here.

12
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:39,660
I have been really nice, April.

13
00:00:39,661 --> 00:00:42,380
All right, but it's time now, okay?

14
00:00:42,381 --> 00:00:45,167
I told you a week ago
to look for a place to live.

15
00:00:45,168 --> 00:00:47,068
- You haven't.
- Because we have a place to live.

16
00:00:47,069 --> 00:00:50,005
So, today, I'm gonna book you
a room at the Archfield.

17
00:00:50,006 --> 00:00:53,174
Tonight, I will come home,
I will help you finish packing,

18
00:00:53,175 --> 00:00:58,679
and, tomorrow, I'm gonna
wake up alone in my bed.

19
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,582
For better or for worse, Jackson.

20
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:05,119
For better or for worse.

21
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,622
<i>But for the most part,</i>

22
00:01:07,623 --> 00:01:10,792
<i>surgery is a choose-your-own-adventure.</i>

23
00:01:10,793 --> 00:01:13,094
I'm here. I'm here.

24
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,263
I know you're mad.

25
00:01:16,264 --> 00:01:18,800
I am so, so sorry.

26
00:01:18,801 --> 00:01:20,568
We can go.

27
00:01:20,569 --> 00:01:22,471
Amelia's not here.

28
00:01:22,472 --> 00:01:23,771
Ha!

29
00:01:23,772 --> 00:01:26,173
Amelia's the late one.
It's not on me.

30
00:01:26,174 --> 00:01:27,708
Oh, um, I got the mail.

31
00:01:27,709 --> 00:01:29,760
I think that your contract is in there.

32
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,080
Come on.

33
00:01:33,081 --> 00:01:35,983
- I'm the good sister.
- <i>I'm</i> the good sister.

34
00:01:35,984 --> 00:01:38,269
Chief of general surgery.

35
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,321
Yay.

36
00:01:42,274 --> 00:01:43,857
Shut up, I'm here.

37
00:01:43,858 --> 00:01:45,326
Whoo!

38
00:01:46,394 --> 00:01:48,112
Okay.

39
00:01:49,898 --> 00:01:51,148
Are you naked?

40
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:52,583
Oh, my God.

41
00:01:52,584 --> 00:01:54,169
I won't be in five minutes.

42
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:55,770
Don't you wear panties?

43
00:01:55,771 --> 00:01:57,287
No way. She likes to breathe.

44
00:01:57,288 --> 00:01:58,906
Tell me you're naked butt

45
00:01:58,907 --> 00:02:00,758
is not on the seat
of my brand-new car.

46
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:02,643
Are you done looking
or are... are you...

47
00:02:02,644 --> 00:02:04,294
Amelia, my children sit back there.

48
00:02:04,295 --> 00:02:06,647
You only have a problem
if they lick the seats.

49
00:02:06,648 --> 00:02:07,965
Do they lick the seats?

50
00:02:07,966 --> 00:02:09,733
She did not just say that.

51
00:02:09,734 --> 00:02:11,452
Just start the car
and drive already.

52
00:02:11,453 --> 00:02:13,821
If I didn't care so much about
the planet for my babies,

53
00:02:13,822 --> 00:02:17,424
this carpool
would not even be happening.

54
00:02:17,425 --> 00:02:18,592
Meredith finally got her contract.

55
00:02:18,593 --> 00:02:19,810
- Whoo!
- It's official.

56
00:02:19,811 --> 00:02:22,029
Lady Chief Trifecta.

57
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,747
Way to go.

58
00:02:23,748 --> 00:02:25,767
The house of lady chiefs.

59
00:02:25,768 --> 00:02:27,234
Sister lady chiefs.

60
00:02:27,235 --> 00:02:29,303
- Put a bra on!
- Oh.

61
00:02:29,304 --> 00:02:31,371
- What was that?
- Hmm?

62
00:02:31,372 --> 00:02:34,174
- What was what?
- That face... you just made a face.

63
00:02:34,175 --> 00:02:37,144
Mm... I don't... I don't...
I don't make faces.

64
00:02:37,145 --> 00:02:40,013
You did.
You just made a face like this.

65
00:02:41,616 --> 00:02:43,600
No, I don't think so.

66
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:46,536
You made a face.

67
00:02:51,262 --> 00:02:53,194
Sadie, what's up?

68
00:02:53,195 --> 00:02:54,845
Can I go home now?

69
00:02:54,846 --> 00:02:56,296
Did you poop yet?

70
00:02:56,297 --> 00:02:57,948
Alex, come on.

71
00:02:57,949 --> 00:03:00,384
I'm eating, I'm walking.

72
00:03:00,385 --> 00:03:02,319
I'm gonna miss
the entire third grade.

73
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,538
You poop, you go...
that's the deal.

74
00:03:04,539 --> 00:03:06,473
And what did I say
about calling me Alex?

75
00:03:06,474 --> 00:03:10,093
I'll call you Dr. Karev when
you say I can go home, Alex.

76
00:03:14,332 --> 00:03:15,966
You're making that face again.

77
00:03:15,967 --> 00:03:17,200
I didn't make a face.

78
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:21,121
I just, um... there's
a party for someone I know

79
00:03:21,122 --> 00:03:22,889
who's getting married... Ethan.

80
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,541
Ethan is getting married.

81
00:03:24,542 --> 00:03:25,726
Who's Ethan?

82
00:03:25,727 --> 00:03:28,128
Maggie's ex-boyfriend,
Ethan... from radiology.

83
00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:29,796
Exceptional ass, even in scrubs.

84
00:03:29,797 --> 00:03:32,198
Come on, they dated
for like six months last year.

85
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:34,134
Oh, right, you were AWOL.

86
00:03:34,135 --> 00:03:38,272
So, someone invited you
to your ex-boyfriend's wedding?

87
00:03:38,273 --> 00:03:39,973
That's so rude.

88
00:03:39,974 --> 00:03:41,174
Maggie, you okay?

89
00:03:41,175 --> 00:03:42,777
About what?

90
00:03:42,778 --> 00:03:44,177
Ethan.

91
00:03:44,178 --> 00:03:46,146
Oh, what? Oh, please.

92
00:03:46,147 --> 00:03:49,699
Uh... Good for Ethan.

93
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,301
What do I care?

94
00:03:51,302 --> 00:03:52,385
I have surgery.

95
00:03:53,654 --> 00:03:57,390
Yeah, she's not okay.

96
00:03:57,391 --> 00:03:58,775
Breathe.

97
00:03:58,776 --> 00:04:01,194
Hi, Laurie, Mason.
I'm Dr. Robbins, this is Dr. Warren.

98
00:04:01,195 --> 00:04:02,278
- How are we doing?
- Good.

99
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:06,399
He's good. I'm being split in half.
And our O.B.'s on vacation.

100
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,334
Okay, um, can I look
at the ultrasound, please?

101
00:04:08,335 --> 00:04:10,470
- Don't tell us the sex.
- Twins wasn't surprise enough?

102
00:04:10,471 --> 00:04:12,272
It was for me. He was thrilled.

103
00:04:12,273 --> 00:04:14,841
Wow!

104
00:04:14,842 --> 00:04:16,976
Uh, it looks... it looks
like they're fighting

105
00:04:16,977 --> 00:04:18,711
to see which one's
gonna come out first.

106
00:04:20,981 --> 00:04:23,383
Okay, so you need to page, uh,
Karev 911.

107
00:04:23,384 --> 00:04:25,568
Okay, let's get these babies out.

108
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:27,154
Dr. Karev,
I was told to come find you?

109
00:04:27,155 --> 00:04:28,838
Yeah, you're with me today.
I'm swamped.

110
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,790
- Just try to keep up.
- With you on peds?

111
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:31,991
Great. Is that a problem?

112
00:04:31,992 --> 00:04:33,042
No, no.

113
00:04:33,043 --> 00:04:34,560
What, you hate kids or something?

114
00:04:34,561 --> 00:04:36,396
No, I don't <i>hate</i> kids.

115
00:04:36,397 --> 00:04:38,198
Uh, what, then?

116
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:40,700
Just peds isn't my
first choice as a specialty.

117
00:04:40,701 --> 00:04:42,435
Shouldn't have said that.

118
00:04:42,436 --> 00:04:44,620
Perfect. She gives me
the one who hates kids.

119
00:04:44,621 --> 00:04:45,638
Thanks, Mer.

120
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:48,641
All right, pick up whatever labs
I've got pending and meet me in L&D.

121
00:04:50,811 --> 00:04:52,562
I don't hate kids.

122
00:04:52,563 --> 00:04:53,696
- You got it.
- Push, push, push, push, push.

123
00:04:53,697 --> 00:04:55,249
You got it, hon.

124
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,383
- All right, we have a little girl.
- Okay, I'm here.

125
00:04:57,384 --> 00:04:59,858
- We have a girl.
- Can we see her?

126
00:04:59,859 --> 00:05:01,654
No, there's another
baby right behind her, okay?

127
00:05:01,655 --> 00:05:03,022
So, we just have to...

128
00:05:03,023 --> 00:05:04,724
Hey, congratulations.
I'm Dr. Karev.

129
00:05:04,725 --> 00:05:05,958
All right, here we go, Laurie.

130
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,326
Apgar's 6.

131
00:05:07,327 --> 00:05:09,295
Baby's jaundiced
and in respiratory distress.

132
00:05:09,296 --> 00:05:10,530
All right, call the NICU.

133
00:05:10,531 --> 00:05:12,415
Tell them to have an umbilical line
and vent on standby.

134
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,133
Okay, Laurie, push, push.

135
00:05:14,134 --> 00:05:15,434
Push, push. Okay.

136
00:05:15,435 --> 00:05:18,087
All right, and now you have little boy.

137
00:05:22,209 --> 00:05:24,610
- Hey, you got him?
- Yeah, I'll see you in C.T.

138
00:05:27,631 --> 00:05:29,632
Can we hold them?

139
00:05:29,633 --> 00:05:33,152
Um, yeah, not just... not just yet.

140
00:05:33,153 --> 00:05:35,522
Babies are looking a little jaundiced,

141
00:05:35,523 --> 00:05:37,591
so Dr. Karev's gonna
take them up to the NICU

142
00:05:37,592 --> 00:05:39,059
and see what might be going on.

143
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,076
Laurie, you did great.

144
00:05:49,369 --> 00:05:50,469
Oh, wow.

145
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:53,205
When did you find out?

146
00:05:53,206 --> 00:05:55,008
This morning.

147
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:57,142
How do you feel?

148
00:05:57,143 --> 00:06:00,145
Like I want to puke.

149
00:06:00,146 --> 00:06:03,098
What did Alex say?

150
00:06:03,099 --> 00:06:05,931
I haven't talked to him yet.

151
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:07,254
- You have to talk to him.
- Do I?

152
00:06:07,255 --> 00:06:09,822
- It's not like I wanted this to happen.
- Jo, you have to talk to him.

153
00:06:09,823 --> 00:06:12,041
I know.

154
00:06:13,943 --> 00:06:16,495
The boy's in C.T. 2.

155
00:06:16,496 --> 00:06:17,846
Come on, come on, come on.

156
00:06:17,847 --> 00:06:19,698
Got your labs.
What are we dealing with?

157
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:22,468
- Newborn twins.
- Don't talk to DeLuca. He hates kids.

158
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:24,636
- What do you have against kids?
- I don't hate kids.

159
00:06:24,637 --> 00:06:26,606
- Scans up yet?
- No, they're coming.

160
00:06:26,607 --> 00:06:28,374
- DeLuca hates kids.
- Hurry up.

161
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,392
- Could be wrong.
- We could be wrong.

162
00:06:30,393 --> 00:06:31,810
About what?

163
00:06:38,918 --> 00:06:42,071
Um... Pull up the little girl's now.

164
00:06:44,924 --> 00:06:48,577
For the record, I don't hate kids.

165
00:06:48,578 --> 00:06:49,962
DeLuca, just shut your stupid mouth.

166
00:06:49,963 --> 00:06:51,919
Damn it.

167
00:06:52,716 --> 00:06:54,400
Damn it.

168
00:06:54,401 --> 00:06:57,219
Can you tell me what just happened?

169
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,556
- You see that?
- Uh-huh.

170
00:07:00,557 --> 00:07:02,508
The boy has a tumor on his liver.

171
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:04,393
So does the girl... same tumor.

172
00:07:04,394 --> 00:07:07,179
Both invading the kidneys, both
causing early heart failure.

173
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,765
What happened is they have to go
tell a mother and a father

174
00:07:09,766 --> 00:07:13,235
that both of their
newborn babies are dying.

00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,067
They're just babies.

178
00:07:32,068 --> 00:07:34,486
This has to be some kind of mistake.

179
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:36,955
They can't have cancer.
You can't be born with cancer.

180
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,492
Hepatoblastoma is
a common liver cancer in kids.

181
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:41,460
It's also very aggressive.

182
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,462
The tumors are
already causing problems

183
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,380
for your kids' kidneys,
hearts, and lungs.

184
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,966
That's why I'm recommending
liver transplants.

185
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,301
Oh, God.

186
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,969
We asked not to see the ultrasound.

187
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,505
We didn't want to know the sex.
We wanted to be surprised.

188
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,007
- Did... did we...
- No, no.

189
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,475
Laurie, this is not your fault.

190
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,810
Your O.B. likely
wouldn't have caught it.

191
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,429
It's okay. It's okay.

192
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,347
Uh, just...

193
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:04,683
What do we do now?

194
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:06,018
The next step is that we get them

195
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:08,687
on the universal donor list,
and we try to find them donors.

196
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:10,822
What about us?
C-can we be donors?

197
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,825
Absolutely. We'll test you
to see if you're a match.

198
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,027
- Yes, right now.
- We want to.

199
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:17,529
Warren, DeLuca, make that happen,

200
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,699
and I'll see you down in the pit.

201
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,584
You should know that
they are in very good hands.

202
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,920
Dr. Karev is amazing.

203
00:08:26,622 --> 00:08:27,833
Hey.

204
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,208
Hey.

205
00:08:32,628 --> 00:08:34,596
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

206
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,387
Do you want to have kids?

207
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:46,441
I... I don't, uh... know.

208
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,393
Uh, yeah.

209
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:50,730
I-I, uh, do you... now?

210
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:52,731
Or ever?

211
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:55,400
I don't know, just is it
something that you want?

212
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:58,236
Yeah, now... or ever.

213
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:01,574
God, Alex, it's... it's a simple
yes-or-no question.

214
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:03,208
What the hell is going on?

215
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,126
Nothing.

216
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,746
I just...

217
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:09,164
Nothing.

218
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,086
- Hey.
- Hey.

219
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:16,137
You're a department head.

220
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,806
Will you take a look
at this contract for me

221
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,507
and tell me if anything
looks weird to you.

222
00:09:19,508 --> 00:09:21,509
Sure.

223
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,194
Okay.

224
00:09:25,297 --> 00:09:27,732
There it is... the face.

225
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,601
What face?

226
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:32,237
Maggie made a face,
and now you're making a face.

227
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,707
What is it about my contract that
makes people make that face?

228
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,258
You know what, I...

229
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:39,545
I don't like talking money
with friends.

230
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:42,013
We're not talking money, Callie.

231
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:44,550
Are we talking money?

232
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:46,968
I think they lowballed you a little.

233
00:09:46,969 --> 00:09:48,302
A lot.

234
00:09:48,303 --> 00:09:50,605
Why do you think that?

235
00:09:50,606 --> 00:09:53,307
Because I make a lot more than you.

236
00:09:53,308 --> 00:09:55,643
Yeah, like a lot more than you.

237
00:09:55,644 --> 00:09:58,112
Like... like a lot more.

238
00:09:58,113 --> 00:10:00,398
- Well, how much?
- Meredith.

239
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,034
Give me a number.

240
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:09,707
I just think, like, can't you
just be civil and rational?

241
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,576
But she won't listen
to anything I have to say.

242
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:13,211
Now she's decided
that this is the hill

243
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:14,328
that she's got to die on.

244
00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:16,380
Of course that hill
is my living room, so...

245
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:18,666
Yeah, look, um, yeah, I'm...
I'm with Robbins today,

246
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:20,885
and Karev has these twins,
so I need...

247
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:22,220
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, no, go.

248
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:23,671
- Okay.
- Yeah.

249
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:29,594
Hey, look.

250
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:32,597
uh... if, you know...
if you need to get out of there

251
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:34,098
or need a couch to crash on...

252
00:10:34,099 --> 00:10:35,683
Oh, no, no. Not a chance.

253
00:10:35,684 --> 00:10:37,268
Thanks, but no. She's out tonight.

254
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:40,071
'Cause I mean, if I leave, she wins.

255
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:42,907
You know, she does not win
my living room.

256
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:44,408
See?

257
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:46,277
I mean, that's not civil, right?

258
00:10:47,946 --> 00:10:50,331
Little girl's going into renal failure.

259
00:10:50,332 --> 00:10:52,617
Boy's lungs are crapping out fast.

260
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:55,119
Maybe we'll get lucky
and the parents will be a match.

261
00:10:58,256 --> 00:11:00,125
Jo hit me up
about having kids today

262
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,626
out of absolutely nowhere.

263
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:02,793
Is that what happens?

264
00:11:02,794 --> 00:11:04,629
You shack up, and then suddenly

265
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,514
your ovaries go into overdrive?

266
00:11:06,515 --> 00:11:08,432
Aw, I think you'll be a good dad.

267
00:11:08,433 --> 00:11:11,185
Your babies will be so
foul-mouthed and dirty and cute.

268
00:11:11,186 --> 00:11:14,188
I just didn't think
we were there yet.

269
00:11:14,189 --> 00:11:16,640
I don't know if I am.

270
00:11:16,641 --> 00:11:18,475
Definitely didn't think she was.

271
00:11:18,476 --> 00:11:21,111
Alex.

272
00:11:21,112 --> 00:11:22,696
- What?
- What if you're already there?

273
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:26,985
W-what if she's asking
'cause she's already knocked up,

274
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,702
and she's just testing the waters?

275
00:11:28,703 --> 00:11:30,822
Why would you even say that?

276
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:33,991
We tested the parents.
The results are back.

277
00:11:33,992 --> 00:11:36,661
Mason, you are a match
to do a directed donation.

278
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:38,712
- Thank God.
- Okay.

279
00:11:41,549 --> 00:11:43,550
That's good, right?

280
00:11:43,551 --> 00:11:46,303
Why don't you look like
that's good news?

281
00:11:46,304 --> 00:11:48,755
Um, Laurie...

282
00:11:48,756 --> 00:11:51,141
I'm afraid that you're not
a viable candidate.

283
00:11:51,142 --> 00:11:52,976
Uh, we still have one.

284
00:11:52,977 --> 00:11:54,995
- I'll split it.
- I'm afraid we can't.

285
00:11:54,996 --> 00:11:57,114
The lobe of your liver
that we have to take is...

286
00:11:57,115 --> 00:11:58,750
We'll need two donors.

287
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:00,984
Wait.

288
00:12:00,985 --> 00:12:03,120
What happens if we don't find one?

289
00:12:03,121 --> 00:12:04,689
One of the babies dies?

290
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,140
We're talking to UNOS,
and we're hoping...

291
00:12:07,141 --> 00:12:09,026
I don't want to hope.

292
00:12:09,027 --> 00:12:11,745
I want to know that I won't have
to choose between my babies.

293
00:12:11,746 --> 00:12:13,658
- Laurie, shh, it's okay.
- It's not okay.

294
00:12:13,659 --> 00:12:14,831
Don't tell me that it's okay.

295
00:12:14,832 --> 00:12:16,350
At least there's something
that you can do.

296
00:12:16,351 --> 00:12:17,818
It's not your fault.
Look, we have one.

297
00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:19,286
Let's just be grateful
that we have one.

298
00:12:19,287 --> 00:12:21,338
I know it's not <i>my</i> fault.

299
00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:23,273
You wanted to be surprised.

300
00:12:23,274 --> 00:12:24,508
You didn't want to know the sex.

301
00:12:24,509 --> 00:12:26,009
Okay, they said it wouldn't have
made a difference...

302
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,612
Well, maybe it would have!

303
00:12:28,613 --> 00:12:30,597
Maybe there was something
that I could have done and...

304
00:12:30,598 --> 00:12:34,385
I am their mother,
and I can't do anything to help them.

305
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:36,119
Stop yelling at me for being able to.

306
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,122
- It's not my fault.
- Well, then, you decide, Mason.

307
00:12:38,123 --> 00:12:41,058
You tell these doctors which one
of our children has to die because...

308
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:42,292
You're not deciding. <i>I</i> am.

309
00:12:44,862 --> 00:12:46,863
You can't make a decision like this.

310
00:12:46,864 --> 00:12:49,166
You shouldn't have to.
That's why I'm here.

311
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:50,817
I'll evaluate, I decide.

312
00:12:50,818 --> 00:12:53,236
The baby that I see is stronger,
is doing better,

313
00:12:53,237 --> 00:12:55,805
has the better chance to thrive
will get the donation.

314
00:12:55,806 --> 00:12:57,057
And the other one?

315
00:12:59,377 --> 00:13:02,513
Will get the next one.

316
00:13:02,514 --> 00:13:06,182
And we will do everything
that we can to find it.

317
00:13:06,183 --> 00:13:10,070
And the rest you put on me.

318
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,265
Bailey?

319
00:13:24,664 --> 00:13:26,465
Uh, Bailey did you like this?

320
00:13:26,466 --> 00:13:28,667
I mean, who knew Bailey was the man?

321
00:13:28,668 --> 00:13:29,969
Mm, you know what?
They lowballed you

322
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:31,320
'cause you're an in-house hire.

323
00:13:31,321 --> 00:13:33,906
- They knew you wouldn't push back.
- I thought the offer was fair.

324
00:13:33,907 --> 00:13:35,708
I mean, for me,
it wasn't about the money.

325
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:38,043
Bailey said she needed me.
The job just fell in my lap.

326
00:13:38,044 --> 00:13:40,112
Unh-unh.

327
00:13:40,113 --> 00:13:42,715
No, you <i>earned</i> that job, okay?

328
00:13:42,716 --> 00:13:45,417
You need to go back and renegotiate.

329
00:13:45,418 --> 00:13:46,719
Hmm?

330
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,122
I can't. It's too late.
I already accepted the offer.

331
00:13:49,123 --> 00:13:51,223
No, walk in there
and demand what you deserve.

332
00:13:51,224 --> 00:13:52,374
Men do it all the time.

333
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,326
They walk in,
they adjust their man parts,

334
00:13:54,327 --> 00:13:55,327
they get more money.

335
00:13:55,328 --> 00:13:57,196
Mm-hmm. Yeah, we all did it.

336
00:13:57,197 --> 00:13:58,998
I did it real good.
I mean, I got...

337
00:13:58,999 --> 00:14:00,149
I make a lot more than you.

338
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,367
I know. You said that!

339
00:14:02,636 --> 00:14:06,572
Okay, so, I mean, what's
the worst they can say? No?

340
00:14:06,573 --> 00:14:08,641
I mean, I'd just go back
to my old job.

341
00:14:08,642 --> 00:14:10,109
- Ugh.
- Ay, no.

342
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,143
You can't go back.

343
00:14:11,144 --> 00:14:12,746
You'd have to move
to another hospital.

344
00:14:12,747 --> 00:14:14,213
Maybe another state.

345
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,667
Maggie, what do you think?

346
00:14:18,668 --> 00:14:21,587
Uh, don't ask me.

347
00:14:21,588 --> 00:14:23,790
I make terrible choices.
I can't be trusted.

348
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,474
I could be having sex right now.

349
00:14:25,475 --> 00:14:29,561
- What?
- Six months of my life dating that man.

350
00:14:29,562 --> 00:14:31,330
Six months...
that is an investment.

351
00:14:31,331 --> 00:14:32,731
- What?
- He was nice.

352
00:14:32,732 --> 00:14:34,049
- Ethan.
- Oh.

353
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,701
He was funny, he was cute,
he was sexy.

354
00:14:35,702 --> 00:14:38,303
- He was sexy, right?
- Mm, very.

355
00:14:38,304 --> 00:14:39,738
- He was.
- Sweet ass.

356
00:14:39,739 --> 00:14:42,524
- No idea.
- Empirically sexy.

357
00:14:42,525 --> 00:14:46,078
And the sex... I mean...

358
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,983
First prize in the talent competition

359
00:14:49,984 --> 00:14:52,552
and the long jump,
if you know what I'm saying.

360
00:14:52,553 --> 00:14:54,119
Mm-hmm.

361
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,822
But, you know, he... he spit
just a little bit when he talked,

362
00:14:56,823 --> 00:14:59,658
and he said "all-timers"
instead of Alzheimer's.

363
00:14:59,659 --> 00:15:01,410
- Uh-oh.
- And I got bored.

364
00:15:01,411 --> 00:15:03,812
And I slid away.
I let it fizzle out.

365
00:15:03,813 --> 00:15:06,131
And then within another six months,

366
00:15:06,132 --> 00:15:07,733
he finds someone else

367
00:15:07,734 --> 00:15:10,470
he's ready to spend
the rest of his life with?

368
00:15:10,471 --> 00:15:12,070
I get that. That can happen.

369
00:15:12,071 --> 00:15:15,056
I make terrible choices.

370
00:15:15,057 --> 00:15:19,111
I leave things behind
and just let the bridges burn.

371
00:15:19,112 --> 00:15:21,530
I did it with Ethan.
I did it with Dean.

372
00:15:21,531 --> 00:15:24,483
Oh, my God.

373
00:15:24,484 --> 00:15:27,419
I did it with my entire life.

374
00:15:28,404 --> 00:15:30,755
One day, I chose to learn

375
00:15:30,756 --> 00:15:32,124
a little bit about my birth mother.

376
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,259
Cut to I live in her house
with her daughter,

377
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:37,162
and I work with the kind
stranger who fathered me,

378
00:15:37,163 --> 00:15:41,600
and I left behind an entire life
and family that no longer exists.

379
00:15:41,601 --> 00:15:43,468
My parents are divorced.

380
00:15:43,469 --> 00:15:45,403
My childhood home is sold.

381
00:15:45,404 --> 00:15:48,974
My mother is
in Hawaii making soups now.

382
00:15:48,975 --> 00:15:50,775
I... I have no home.

383
00:15:50,776 --> 00:15:52,594
It's like I-I flew to this planet

384
00:15:52,595 --> 00:15:54,413
on an exploratory mission,

385
00:15:54,414 --> 00:15:58,116
and the Earth blew up behind me

386
00:15:58,117 --> 00:16:00,318
and I can't go back.

387
00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:03,455
And now I'm here with you aliens.

388
00:16:03,456 --> 00:16:07,225
Except I'm the alien,
and I'm all alone,

389
00:16:07,226 --> 00:16:09,494
and I have nothing,
and no one wants me.

390
00:16:09,495 --> 00:16:11,629
That...

391
00:16:13,165 --> 00:16:15,083
You got us. We want you.

392
00:16:15,084 --> 00:16:16,969
I can't have sex with you.

393
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,286
No.

394
00:16:18,287 --> 00:16:20,371
You're a Cylon.

395
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,408
This is "Galactica."

396
00:16:23,409 --> 00:16:26,344
I really do like her.

397
00:16:26,345 --> 00:16:28,112
She make me not the crazy sister.

398
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:29,464
What do you think they're paying her?

399
00:16:41,076 --> 00:16:43,127
Why are you doing that?

400
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:45,914
Because people eat dinner.

401
00:16:45,915 --> 00:16:47,433
Not people who are moving out.

402
00:16:47,434 --> 00:16:49,250
April, you're supposed to be packing.

403
00:16:49,251 --> 00:16:52,471
I'm not leaving because
I told you I'm not giving up.

404
00:16:52,472 --> 00:16:54,706
If you want to trade nights
on the couch, we can do that.

405
00:16:54,707 --> 00:16:56,208
But I'm not moving out of my home.

406
00:16:56,209 --> 00:16:58,159
It's my home. It's my...

407
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,612
Oh, I hate that you are forcing
me to say this stuff.

408
00:17:01,613 --> 00:17:03,114
April, okay,
it's my name on the lease.

409
00:17:03,115 --> 00:17:05,466
It's my place.
You moved in, and you moved out.

410
00:17:05,467 --> 00:17:07,418
No, I didn't move out.

411
00:17:07,419 --> 00:17:09,854
I went away, and then I came back.

412
00:17:09,855 --> 00:17:10,988
And I am sorry.

413
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:14,275
I am truly sorry
that I wasn't here for you,

414
00:17:14,276 --> 00:17:16,077
but I thought if we had some space...

415
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:17,261
I need space now!

416
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:20,932
You see?

417
00:17:20,933 --> 00:17:21,999
Right now, I really just wanted

418
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,369
to have my burrito and go to sleep.

419
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:26,204
Save it. I made dinner.

420
00:17:26,205 --> 00:17:27,905
What is it... boiled bunny?

421
00:17:27,906 --> 00:17:29,341
'Cause you sound crazy.

422
00:17:29,342 --> 00:17:31,993
Okay, I feel like a hostage.

423
00:17:31,994 --> 00:17:33,761
But like a reverse hostage
where the kidnapper

424
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:35,781
just follows me everywhere
and won't leave my damn house.

425
00:17:35,782 --> 00:17:37,298
You know what they call that?

426
00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:38,649
Marriage.

427
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:41,952
And it gets hard,
but you don't just leave.

428
00:17:41,953 --> 00:17:43,187
You don't just stop.

429
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:45,606
You do. <i>You</i> do just stop.

430
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:47,658
You know what they call that?
Divorce.

431
00:17:47,659 --> 00:17:49,527
What?

432
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:51,595
Tomorrow morning,
when you go to work,

433
00:17:51,596 --> 00:17:52,963
I'm having the locks changed.

434
00:17:52,964 --> 00:17:55,232
Yeah, tomorrow night when
I get home from work,

435
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:56,734
I'm bringing a crowbar!

436
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,285
Listen to yourself.

437
00:18:00,438 --> 00:18:04,458
Two babies, two tumors, one liver.

438
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:07,661
How's Karev supposed
to make a call like that?

439
00:18:07,662 --> 00:18:10,397
Well, first,

440
00:18:10,398 --> 00:18:13,050
he'll try to avoid having
to make the call at all.

441
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:15,069
He'll try to find another donor.

442
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,289
Call UNOS every 20 minutes
until they have something.

443
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,023
He'll bug UNOS...

444
00:18:19,024 --> 00:18:20,558
And call every hospital,
their transplant teams...

445
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,042
Comb the hospital,

446
00:18:22,043 --> 00:18:26,330
every hospital in Seattle
for a matching liver.

447
00:18:26,331 --> 00:18:30,351
Then he'll do a physical
evaluation of each baby

448
00:18:30,352 --> 00:18:33,737
to look for any
other malformations...

449
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:37,491
see which one
seems healthier overall.

450
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:40,644
Then he'll do a full lab work-up,

451
00:18:40,645 --> 00:18:42,913
go over and over the results,

452
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:47,034
look for any other possible
co-existing problems,

453
00:18:47,035 --> 00:18:51,422
like a kidney disease
or heart anomalies.

454
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:54,859
At... at this point, he's hoping
to find something wrong.

455
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,176
Hey. I'm here.

456
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:57,311
And if he's smart,

457
00:18:57,312 --> 00:19:00,331
he's got someone
double checking his work.

458
00:19:00,332 --> 00:19:02,934
And then it's down
to the tumors themselves.

459
00:19:02,935 --> 00:19:05,085
What's the distance of the tumor
from the cantlie line?

460
00:19:05,086 --> 00:19:06,687
8 millimeters.

461
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:08,605
Yeah, I know I just called,
but this infant

462
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,707
is on a timeframe, so if you just...

463
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,075
Yes, I'll hold.

464
00:19:12,076 --> 00:19:15,579
Check and recheck every scan.

465
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:18,732
See if they involve
more than one lobe.

466
00:19:18,733 --> 00:19:22,369
If there's infiltration
of other structures.

467
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:27,190
You just don't give up
until you find your answer.

468
00:19:37,168 --> 00:19:38,636
Yeah.

469
00:19:40,572 --> 00:19:42,173
How can I help?

470
00:19:42,174 --> 00:19:44,475
Take a look at the labs again.

471
00:19:50,748 --> 00:19:52,783
We're screwed.
The labs are the same.

472
00:19:52,784 --> 00:19:54,718
The staging is the same.

473
00:19:54,719 --> 00:19:56,853
Both tumors
are causing renal failure.

474
00:19:56,854 --> 00:19:58,455
Look, what about the measurements.

475
00:19:58,456 --> 00:20:00,006
The girl's tumor's bigger.

476
00:20:00,007 --> 00:20:01,058
The boy's is smaller,

477
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:02,726
but it's invading
the left hepatic vein.

478
00:20:02,727 --> 00:20:04,662
One's too big,
the other one's too complicated.

479
00:20:04,663 --> 00:20:05,763
It's a dead freaking heat.

480
00:20:05,764 --> 00:20:09,316
You need food
and a shower and sleep.

481
00:20:09,317 --> 00:20:10,984
You need to walk away for a minute.

482
00:20:10,985 --> 00:20:12,836
I'm serious.

483
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,888
Let's go. Go.

484
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,911
- Try UNOS again.
- Yeah.

485
00:20:26,884 --> 00:20:28,084
Hey.

486
00:20:30,421 --> 00:20:31,971
All nighter?

487
00:20:31,972 --> 00:20:34,541
Yeah.

488
00:20:34,542 --> 00:20:36,626
And I need to go back.

489
00:20:36,627 --> 00:20:39,130
I just, uh... I just need
a couple hours' sleep.

490
00:20:39,131 --> 00:20:42,333
Can we talk?

491
00:20:42,334 --> 00:20:44,150
Yeah.

492
00:20:44,151 --> 00:20:46,870
Okay, yeah.

493
00:20:55,913 --> 00:20:57,046
A-are you...

494
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,731
I found this...

495
00:20:58,732 --> 00:21:02,485
When I was unpacking...
I, uh, wasn't snooping.

496
00:21:02,486 --> 00:21:04,687
I know it's kind of none
of my business, but...

497
00:21:04,688 --> 00:21:06,589
- Oh.
- I picked it up.

498
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:08,157
And then I just
couldn't put it down.

499
00:21:08,158 --> 00:21:09,792
Oh, okay, this.

500
00:21:09,793 --> 00:21:11,477
You have babies?

501
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:14,213
No, no, these are embryos.

502
00:21:14,214 --> 00:21:16,365
With Izzie?

503
00:21:16,366 --> 00:21:19,135
Listen, Izzie wanted
to freeze her eggs.

504
00:21:19,136 --> 00:21:21,237
She needed them fertilized.
I did it, she froze them.

505
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,473
- That's all.
- That's all?

506
00:21:23,474 --> 00:21:24,974
Yeah, then she left me.

507
00:21:24,975 --> 00:21:26,109
That's all. You can toss it.

508
00:21:29,263 --> 00:21:31,581
So, you wanted
to have babies with her?

509
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:37,120
Yeah, I... I don't...
I don't know.

510
00:21:37,121 --> 00:21:40,556
I mean, that was...
that was a hundred years ago.

511
00:21:40,557 --> 00:21:44,327
I'm just asking
because when I asked you

512
00:21:44,328 --> 00:21:45,962
if you wanted to move in with me,

513
00:21:45,963 --> 00:21:47,364
you said that you did

514
00:21:47,365 --> 00:21:49,231
and that you could
picture a life with me,

515
00:21:49,232 --> 00:21:51,000
but you never said anything
about babies.

516
00:21:51,001 --> 00:21:53,971
You said,
"Maybe we could get a dog."

517
00:21:53,972 --> 00:21:55,439
Do you want a dog?

518
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,423
No, I want to know
what we're doing here.

519
00:21:57,424 --> 00:22:00,536
I love you, and you love me.

520
00:22:00,537 --> 00:22:01,827
I know, but when I look ahead...

521
00:22:01,828 --> 00:22:03,347
Why are we looking ahead?

522
00:22:03,348 --> 00:22:05,348
If you had or maybe
you do have, for all I know,

523
00:22:05,349 --> 00:22:07,751
a bunch of Izzie babies walking
around with your face on them...

524
00:22:07,752 --> 00:22:09,435
And why are we doing it now?

525
00:22:09,436 --> 00:22:12,254
And... and I'm just
the "let's get a dog" girl?

526
00:22:12,255 --> 00:22:14,558
I'm wondering what you think
we are, what you want.

527
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,409
Look, I didn't have babies
with Izzie.

528
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:19,094
My role in that whole thing
was with a cup and a magazine.

529
00:22:19,095 --> 00:22:21,030
But you would have.

530
00:22:21,031 --> 00:22:22,781
You wanted to.

531
00:22:22,782 --> 00:22:25,684
<i>She</i> was worth it to you.

532
00:22:25,685 --> 00:22:28,354
But when I ask you
if you want to have babies,

533
00:22:28,355 --> 00:22:30,456
you're all, "I don't know,
yes, no, maybe, uh..."

534
00:22:30,457 --> 00:22:31,907
She was my wife.

535
00:22:31,908 --> 00:22:33,592
- We were married.
- That's my point.

536
00:22:33,593 --> 00:22:35,144
- What am I?
- She had cancer.

537
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,396
She didn't even know if she was gonna
be able to after the radiation.

538
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:39,498
No, don't do... what,
I have to get sick

539
00:22:39,499 --> 00:22:42,001
to figure out if you're
gonna go all in with me?

540
00:22:43,219 --> 00:22:45,304
And now you're gonna go.

541
00:22:45,305 --> 00:22:47,172
Yes.

542
00:22:47,173 --> 00:22:49,808
And you're right... it's kind of
none of your business.

543
00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:51,261
And I'm not doing this!

544
00:22:51,262 --> 00:22:53,812
I'm not talking about babies
that I didn't have with Izzie

545
00:22:53,813 --> 00:22:55,898
or may or may not have with you.

546
00:22:55,899 --> 00:22:57,850
I have two real babies
I'm responsible for

547
00:22:57,851 --> 00:22:59,068
at the hospital right now.

548
00:22:59,069 --> 00:23:01,771
I have enough kids to take care of.

549
00:23:11,006 --> 00:23:12,941
Hey.

550
00:23:12,942 --> 00:23:15,293
How did you negotiate your contract?

551
00:23:15,294 --> 00:23:16,777
What?

552
00:23:16,778 --> 00:23:18,012
I mean, what did they offer?

553
00:23:18,013 --> 00:23:19,580
You were coming
from private practice,

554
00:23:19,581 --> 00:23:21,165
so you had a salary
you could leverage.

555
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:22,817
- How much was that?
- Mer, stop it.

556
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,418
Well, just tell me.
I won't tell anyone.

557
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:29,423
If one of your kids had to die,
which one would you choose and why?

558
00:23:29,424 --> 00:23:32,326
Well, Bailey because he
kept me up all night.

559
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:34,428
But ask me tomorrow,
it might be Zola.

560
00:23:34,429 --> 00:23:36,097
Why? What's... what's going on?

561
00:23:36,098 --> 00:23:38,949
I have two newborns
who need a liver transplant

562
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,734
- and one liver.
- Ugh.

563
00:23:40,735 --> 00:23:43,404
The other one won't survive
until tomorrow.

564
00:23:43,405 --> 00:23:45,606
Well, you have to run all the tests.

565
00:23:45,607 --> 00:23:47,374
Yeah, every test is a tie.

566
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:49,527
There's no medical
question anymore, Mer.

567
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:52,480
They're just kids now,
and I got to decide

568
00:23:52,481 --> 00:23:54,215
whether the boy lives
or the girl lives.

569
00:23:54,216 --> 00:23:57,885
I mean, Alex, you really have
to trust your instincts.

570
00:23:57,886 --> 00:23:59,453
I don't know, Mer.

571
00:23:59,454 --> 00:24:01,722
If I was one of these kids,
with my family,

572
00:24:01,723 --> 00:24:04,158
where I came from,
I wouldn't have bet on me.

573
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,695
I... I would have looked
in my crystal ball

574
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,998
and seen a druggie or a burnout or...

575
00:24:10,999 --> 00:24:13,200
I would not have seen me as
the guy who make the decisions.

576
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:16,670
I would not have seen that coming.

577
00:24:16,671 --> 00:24:20,007
I mean, what if one of them
becomes a serial killer,

578
00:24:20,008 --> 00:24:23,277
the other one's
gonna cure Alzheimer's?

579
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:25,579
That's not your problem.

580
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,815
I mean, it's just like
raising your own kids.

581
00:24:27,816 --> 00:24:29,416
They're gonna be who they are.

582
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:32,503
We just have to try to give them
the best shot we can.

583
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,589
Hey. Hey.

584
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:38,425
The twins' lungs are filling with fluid.
You're out of time.

585
00:24:38,426 --> 00:24:40,410
Screw it.
I'm not making this call.

586
00:24:40,411 --> 00:24:42,329
If there's a decision to be made

587
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:44,431
about withdrawing care from
an infant, Bailey can do it.

588
00:24:44,432 --> 00:24:45,732
She's the chief.
She can do it, not me.

589
00:24:45,733 --> 00:24:48,135
No, no, hey, no, no, Alex.
What are you doing?

590
00:24:48,136 --> 00:24:49,437
I have been watching you.

591
00:24:49,438 --> 00:24:52,005
I have been in awe of you
stepping up for these babies,

592
00:24:52,006 --> 00:24:53,807
for these parents in a way that...

593
00:24:53,808 --> 00:24:56,578
Do you remember
the first time we ever talked?

594
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:58,178
Really talked.

595
00:24:58,179 --> 00:25:00,447
We were on a plane,
and we just picked up

596
00:25:00,448 --> 00:25:02,550
a transplant organ
from a kid who died,

597
00:25:02,551 --> 00:25:04,284
and you were upset and pissy

598
00:25:04,285 --> 00:25:06,421
because you thought
that I didn't care.

599
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:09,723
But I thought, "Wow."

600
00:25:09,724 --> 00:25:11,925
This guy could do it.

601
00:25:11,926 --> 00:25:16,329
He cares enough about this work.

602
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:18,231
"This guy has it."

603
00:25:18,232 --> 00:25:21,451
And I knew that day, Alex.

604
00:25:21,452 --> 00:25:23,003
And today...

605
00:25:27,608 --> 00:25:30,677
I have been so proud of you.

606
00:25:32,513 --> 00:25:35,115
And so now you can't...
you can't hand it over

607
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:37,217
to somebody else
because they're yours,

608
00:25:37,218 --> 00:25:38,752
and they need you,
and you can do it.

609
00:25:38,753 --> 00:25:40,720
And you have to because
if you give it to Bailey,

610
00:25:40,721 --> 00:25:43,490
you won't be able to look at yourself
in the mirror. I promise you.

611
00:25:43,491 --> 00:25:46,509
You'll always wonder what kind
of doctor you could be.

612
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:49,913
This is the job, Alex,

613
00:25:49,914 --> 00:25:53,249
and it's why you get paid
the big bucks.

614
00:25:57,538 --> 00:25:59,839
Mason, this is Dr. Bailey.

615
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,410
I've asked her
to perform your operation

616
00:26:02,411 --> 00:26:04,144
to remove the lobe
of your liver for donation.

617
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:05,645
And who will get it?

618
00:26:07,882 --> 00:26:10,550
Well, the test and the scans
were inconclusive.

619
00:26:10,551 --> 00:26:12,502
I need to open up both babies.

620
00:26:12,503 --> 00:26:14,988
I need to see both tumors up close.

621
00:26:14,989 --> 00:26:17,425
And then I'll decide.

622
00:26:17,426 --> 00:26:18,808
You have to?

623
00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:20,627
In order to make the best choice,

624
00:26:20,628 --> 00:26:23,780
the right choice,
or we risk losing them both.

625
00:26:23,781 --> 00:26:27,001
And we're racing the clock,
so I need to take them now.

626
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:30,787
Wait, wait!
We... They don't have names.

627
00:26:30,788 --> 00:26:33,056
We're not letting them go
before we name them.

628
00:26:39,196 --> 00:26:41,631
She looks like an Emma.

629
00:26:41,632 --> 00:26:43,232
She does.

630
00:26:43,233 --> 00:26:45,184
Hi, Emma.

631
00:26:49,573 --> 00:26:52,292
- Daniel.
- Daniel.

632
00:26:52,293 --> 00:26:53,593
Emma and Daniel.

633
00:27:01,971 --> 00:27:05,104
- What do you have against kids anyway?
- God, nothing!

634
00:27:05,105 --> 00:27:06,622
Okay, I don't hate kids.

635
00:27:09,476 --> 00:27:11,445
It's not the kids...
it's the parents.

636
00:27:11,446 --> 00:27:13,079
All right?

637
00:27:16,083 --> 00:27:18,551
I was an E.M.T.
right out of high school.

638
00:27:18,552 --> 00:27:20,453
I loved it.

639
00:27:20,454 --> 00:27:22,923
It's why I went to med school.

640
00:27:22,924 --> 00:27:26,709
My second call out, it's an MVC.

641
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:29,579
A woman's in the front seat
bleeding from neck lac.

642
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:33,266
And she's holding her little
toddler, who is D.O.A.

643
00:27:33,267 --> 00:27:36,203
She wouldn't let him go.

644
00:27:36,204 --> 00:27:38,554
And I'm trying to stop her
from bleeding,

645
00:27:38,555 --> 00:27:40,607
but she just held on.

646
00:27:40,608 --> 00:27:42,925
And cried.

647
00:27:42,926 --> 00:27:48,214
And the sound she made...
I thought she's gonna

648
00:27:48,215 --> 00:27:51,484
cry like this for the rest of her life.

649
00:27:51,485 --> 00:27:56,188
So, I decided right there,
no peds for me.

650
00:27:56,189 --> 00:27:59,675
And not because of the kids.

651
00:27:59,676 --> 00:28:02,995
I don't want that responsibility
over a parent.

652
00:28:02,996 --> 00:28:05,965
And, yeah, maybe that... maybe
that makes me a lousy doctor,

653
00:28:05,966 --> 00:28:08,601
or maybe I'm just not strong enough.

654
00:28:08,602 --> 00:28:13,973
But... I get to decide
what I'm best suited for.

655
00:28:13,974 --> 00:28:15,774
Right?

656
00:28:15,775 --> 00:28:18,210
I mean, don't I get to decide
what kind of doctor I'm gonna be?

657
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:23,249
Yeah, you do.

658
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:26,201
You have to.

659
00:28:34,487 --> 00:28:36,589
15 blade, please.

660
00:28:43,796 --> 00:28:45,241
Scalpel.

661
00:28:47,149 --> 00:28:50,185
And 10 blade.

662
00:28:59,328 --> 00:29:01,546
Push Bovie to 30.
More lap pads.

663
00:29:01,547 --> 00:29:03,081
That's what I needed to see.

664
00:29:03,082 --> 00:29:06,117
All right, hold on, don't move.

665
00:29:06,118 --> 00:29:08,319
I need a little more retraction.

666
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,538
Good. Hold right there.

667
00:29:10,539 --> 00:29:12,640
Do you see where she's got...

668
00:29:12,641 --> 00:29:14,425
Wait, yeah.

669
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:19,397
Yeah.

670
00:29:19,398 --> 00:29:20,999
What do you think?

671
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,433
Okay.

672
00:29:23,538 --> 00:29:26,772
It's Emma.
The liver's going to Emma.

673
00:29:26,773 --> 00:29:29,975
All right, there you go.

674
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:32,944
But I need you to do
the transplant for me.

675
00:29:32,945 --> 00:29:34,612
I want to try
a primary resection on Daniel

676
00:29:34,613 --> 00:29:36,481
and see if can save
the liver he already has...

677
00:29:36,482 --> 00:29:37,999
at least buy him more time.

678
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,250
- Alex.
- I want to save them both.

679
00:29:39,251 --> 00:29:40,818
But can the child even withstand?

680
00:29:40,819 --> 00:29:42,453
Probably not...
I mean, de-sating on me,

681
00:29:42,454 --> 00:29:44,072
and I've already maxed out meds,
but I swear,

682
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,857
if don't try,
he'll be dead by tonight.

683
00:29:45,858 --> 00:29:48,810
I want to try.

684
00:29:48,811 --> 00:29:52,430
<i>Suction. Retract here.</i>

685
00:29:58,237 --> 00:30:00,339
Hey, Karev's throwing a Hail Mary.

686
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,540
<i>Suction.</i>

687
00:30:02,541 --> 00:30:04,775
Why you furrowing your brow at me?

688
00:30:04,776 --> 00:30:07,245
I would think
that <i>you</i> of all people...

689
00:30:07,246 --> 00:30:09,280
this hospital's first
<i>female</i> chief of surgery...

690
00:30:09,281 --> 00:30:12,366
would fight for a woman to get paid
at least as much as any man.

691
00:30:12,367 --> 00:30:13,634
This is about Meredith Grey.

692
00:30:13,635 --> 00:30:15,753
I mean, if you do not value
her enough, then just...

693
00:30:15,754 --> 00:30:18,756
It is inappropriate for me to discuss
the salary of another employee.

694
00:30:18,757 --> 00:30:20,257
She deserves more,
and you know it.

695
00:30:20,258 --> 00:30:23,028
I do, and don't ever suggest
to me that I do not stand

696
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:25,813
in sisterhood with other women
in this hospital.

697
00:30:25,814 --> 00:30:29,900
"You've never been 4'11" tall
and overlooked

698
00:30:29,901 --> 00:30:31,719
and called "girl"
by your male colleagues.

699
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,804
You don't know. I am woman.

700
00:30:33,805 --> 00:30:35,239
Hear me roar.

701
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,141
But I've already mentored Grey.

702
00:30:37,142 --> 00:30:39,810
I've already taught her
what she needs to know.

703
00:30:39,811 --> 00:30:41,912
And now that I'm chief
of this hospital,

704
00:30:41,913 --> 00:30:45,449
it's not my fault if she's not used
the skills that I taught her.

705
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:47,218
And it's not my job
to be giving away money

706
00:30:47,219 --> 00:30:49,203
when it's not asked for.

707
00:30:49,204 --> 00:30:51,188
You have coddled her.

708
00:30:51,189 --> 00:30:53,891
Y-y... Since Derek,
you have coddled her,

709
00:30:53,892 --> 00:30:55,492
and I won't do that.

710
00:30:55,493 --> 00:30:57,728
No, she needs to rise.

711
00:30:57,729 --> 00:30:59,897
And she needs to rise on her own

712
00:30:59,898 --> 00:31:02,333
so she knows
she can rise on her own.

713
00:31:02,334 --> 00:31:03,901
Because...

714
00:31:03,902 --> 00:31:07,721
You may not be here
the next time she falls.

715
00:31:07,722 --> 00:31:10,374
She needs to fight for herself.

716
00:31:13,228 --> 00:31:15,296
Okay.

717
00:31:15,297 --> 00:31:19,700
This is what
a feminist looks like, sir.

718
00:31:19,701 --> 00:31:22,219
Oh, how's the little girl?

719
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,293
Good. She's back in the NICU.

720
00:31:24,294 --> 00:31:26,757
Perfect anastomosis, and her
kidneys have already bounced back.

721
00:31:26,758 --> 00:31:27,858
But how's he doing?

722
00:31:29,661 --> 00:31:32,296
That's a good
resection margin, right?

723
00:31:32,297 --> 00:31:33,898
- Yeah.
- I see you got most of it.

724
00:31:33,899 --> 00:31:35,966
It's decent, it's just really close...

725
00:31:35,967 --> 00:31:39,286
I just need to get this last...

726
00:31:39,287 --> 00:31:41,205
Suction.

727
00:31:41,206 --> 00:31:44,108
- Suction.
- Hepatic vein's leaking. Clamp.

728
00:31:45,927 --> 00:31:47,528
Another clamp.

729
00:31:52,116 --> 00:31:54,518
No, no, come on.

730
00:31:55,687 --> 00:31:57,704
Was it a bad call trying to resect?

731
00:31:57,705 --> 00:31:58,722
- No.
- No.

732
00:31:58,723 --> 00:32:02,059
It was the right call,
just a bold one.

733
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,561
Yeah, this would have happened
during his transplant surgery.

734
00:32:04,562 --> 00:32:05,830
Mm-hmm.

735
00:32:05,831 --> 00:32:07,481
Karev chose the right twin.

736
00:32:07,482 --> 00:32:09,149
Another clamp.

737
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:16,306
Got it.

738
00:32:16,307 --> 00:32:17,366
You did it?

739
00:32:17,692 --> 00:32:19,076
You did it.

740
00:32:19,077 --> 00:32:20,427
What?

741
00:32:20,428 --> 00:32:21,895
Damn it, he's arresting.

742
00:32:21,896 --> 00:32:25,248
Push .02 of epi
and another 50cc of blood.

743
00:32:25,249 --> 00:32:27,401
Come on, buddy.

744
00:32:27,402 --> 00:32:28,785
Come on.

745
00:32:28,786 --> 00:32:30,387
B.P.'s dropping.
Persistent bradycardia.

746
00:32:30,388 --> 00:32:32,739
Try it .08 to the et tube.

747
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,124
Come on, we're losing him.

748
00:32:34,125 --> 00:32:36,059
But you had him.

749
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:38,728
He won't get him back.

750
00:32:38,729 --> 00:32:40,497
No, he won't.

751
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,274
I'm gonna close. Stapler.

752
00:32:51,275 --> 00:32:52,709
But you've got a rhythm.

753
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:54,628
Those are agonal beats.
They won't last.

754
00:32:54,629 --> 00:32:56,830
So, what do we do?
Just push more epi, right?

755
00:32:56,831 --> 00:32:58,715
He's maxed out on epi.
His heart's too weak.

756
00:32:58,716 --> 00:33:01,284
No, you can't just stop, okay...
What else?

757
00:33:01,285 --> 00:33:02,802
There's nothing else.

758
00:33:11,245 --> 00:33:13,913
Nothing to do but wait.

759
00:33:16,367 --> 00:33:18,585
Oh, Alex.

760
00:34:49,518 --> 00:34:52,820
You have a beautiful baby girl.

761
00:34:52,821 --> 00:34:55,156
The transplant went very well.

762
00:34:55,157 --> 00:34:57,441
She's now recovering
very, very smoothly.

763
00:35:03,198 --> 00:35:07,902
Laurie, we did everything
we could to save your boy.

764
00:35:07,903 --> 00:35:09,503
No.

765
00:35:09,504 --> 00:35:11,138
Despite our best efforts,
the tumor was just...

766
00:35:13,041 --> 00:35:15,276
I'm so sorry.

767
00:35:34,929 --> 00:35:38,048
<i>Dr. Cohen, NICU.
Dr. Cohen to NICU.</i>

768
00:35:41,219 --> 00:35:43,671
What is it, Grey?

769
00:35:43,672 --> 00:35:47,024
We need to talk about my contract.

770
00:35:47,025 --> 00:35:48,425
Mm-hmm.

771
00:35:51,362 --> 00:35:54,381
You said I deserved
to be your chief of general,

772
00:35:54,382 --> 00:35:56,717
that I made your job easier.

773
00:35:56,718 --> 00:35:59,286
I was happy. I was grateful.

774
00:35:59,287 --> 00:36:01,688
That doesn't change the fact
that I earned this job,

775
00:36:01,689 --> 00:36:04,091
and I worked very hard for it.

776
00:36:04,092 --> 00:36:06,361
I need to feel as valued
as you say you value me.

777
00:36:06,362 --> 00:36:08,296
I need to be able
to look in the mirror.

778
00:36:08,297 --> 00:36:10,664
This is just not enough.

779
00:36:10,665 --> 00:36:13,901
Do you have number in mind?

780
00:36:13,902 --> 00:36:15,670
Yes.

781
00:36:27,849 --> 00:36:29,650
I can make that happen.

782
00:36:29,651 --> 00:36:31,518
Is that all, Grey?

783
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:34,371
Yep. That's it.

784
00:36:34,372 --> 00:36:37,290
Okay, thanks.

785
00:36:37,291 --> 00:36:39,509
- Grey?
- Yeah.

786
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:42,162
Well done.

787
00:36:51,022 --> 00:36:53,573
Dr. Karev.

788
00:36:53,574 --> 00:36:54,641
You pooped?

789
00:36:54,642 --> 00:36:55,692
I pooped!

790
00:36:57,245 --> 00:36:58,762
Let's get you out of here.

791
00:36:58,763 --> 00:36:59,946
Yes!

792
00:37:14,211 --> 00:37:18,798
Thank you for not changing the locks.

793
00:37:18,799 --> 00:37:22,068
Things got a little crazy last night.

794
00:37:22,069 --> 00:37:23,670
Maybe you're right.

795
00:37:23,671 --> 00:37:26,623
Maybe I'm being a little crazy.

796
00:37:26,624 --> 00:37:30,778
But is it really crazy
to try like hell to save

797
00:37:30,779 --> 00:37:33,897
the one thing in the world
that matters most to you?

798
00:37:33,898 --> 00:37:37,300
I love you, and if fighting for y...

799
00:37:40,504 --> 00:37:43,389
<i>When you're faced</i>
<i>with the tough choices,</i>

800
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:45,742
<i>it comes down to you.</i>

801
00:38:01,725 --> 00:38:04,777
<i>What can you live with?</i>

802
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:11,267
<i>What can you leave behind?</i>

803
00:38:11,268 --> 00:38:14,037
Towels are in the bathroom.

804
00:38:14,038 --> 00:38:15,805
Anything else you need?

805
00:38:15,806 --> 00:38:18,858
- No, no, no. I'm fine, thank you.
- Okay.

806
00:38:20,411 --> 00:38:21,628
It's only for one night.

807
00:38:21,629 --> 00:38:23,764
He shouldn't have
to sleep in a hotel. It's...

808
00:38:29,453 --> 00:38:31,137
- Two more, please.
- You got it.

809
00:38:33,073 --> 00:38:36,175
Here you go.

810
00:38:36,176 --> 00:38:38,995
Dr. Pierce, um...
I'm off shift.

811
00:38:38,996 --> 00:38:41,214
Just having a quick one
before I head home.

812
00:38:41,215 --> 00:38:42,381
It's fine.

813
00:38:42,382 --> 00:38:43,449
I have no home.

814
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:46,053
My planet exploded.

815
00:38:53,828 --> 00:38:55,962
You know, I don't hate kids.

816
00:38:55,963 --> 00:38:57,830
- I just...
- Another round?

817
00:38:57,831 --> 00:38:59,098
...hate it when they die.

818
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:02,034
Hey. We have that in common.

819
00:39:10,777 --> 00:39:12,712
Hey, can I ask you something?

820
00:39:12,713 --> 00:39:14,513
Hmm?

821
00:39:14,514 --> 00:39:16,665
Did you ever wonder why
people should trust us

822
00:39:16,666 --> 00:39:18,317
to just decide, like,

823
00:39:18,318 --> 00:39:21,253
the most important questions
of their lives?

824
00:39:21,254 --> 00:39:23,989
I mean, you're just a person
just like them, right?

825
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:27,777
But suddenly, you're given this
incredible responsibility to just...

826
00:39:27,778 --> 00:39:29,211
You have really pretty eyes.

827
00:39:29,212 --> 00:39:31,831
Uh... Thank you.

828
00:39:42,175 --> 00:39:46,028
<i>Right or wrong...</i>
<i>you have to decide...</i>

829
00:39:49,299 --> 00:39:51,650
<i>what you're willing</i>
<i>to go down fighting for.</i>

830
00:39:51,651 --> 00:39:53,085
You okay?

831
00:39:53,086 --> 00:39:55,654
Yeah.

832
00:39:55,655 --> 00:39:57,523
Look, about last night.

833
00:39:57,524 --> 00:40:00,059
No, you said it's none of
my business, so... It's...

834
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:02,695
Well, it's not... And it is.

835
00:40:02,696 --> 00:40:04,329
It's...

836
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:07,216
Look, I-I-I get mad, and...
and you get squirrely.

837
00:40:07,217 --> 00:40:09,351
- I do not...
- No, you get squirrely when someone says

838
00:40:09,352 --> 00:40:11,670
they're gonna be there, and then
you think maybe they won't.

839
00:40:11,671 --> 00:40:13,506
That happens. You're allowed.

840
00:40:15,859 --> 00:40:19,077
- Okay.
- I'm not going anywhere.

841
00:40:19,078 --> 00:40:21,880
And if... if...

842
00:40:21,881 --> 00:40:24,551
having a kid is what you want,

843
00:40:24,552 --> 00:40:28,053
then... I can be ready.

844
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:30,739
I'm ready.

845
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:33,759
I mean let's do it.

846
00:40:35,429 --> 00:40:38,280
Let's make a baby right now.

847
00:40:38,281 --> 00:40:41,984
Are you out of your mind?

848
00:40:41,985 --> 00:40:44,036
We're not having a baby.

849
00:40:44,037 --> 00:40:45,821
I'm in the middle of a residency.

850
00:40:45,822 --> 00:40:47,656
You are never home.

851
00:40:47,657 --> 00:40:50,659
And what about us?
We... we haven't even traveled.

852
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,745
And what happened to the dog?
Let's get a dog.

853
00:40:52,746 --> 00:40:54,496
No, do not come near me.

854
00:40:54,497 --> 00:40:56,715
We are not making a baby.

855
00:40:56,716 --> 00:40:58,834
No.

856
00:40:58,835 --> 00:40:59,919
Ruff.
