1
00:00:06,594 --> 00:00:08,658
E. R.

2
00:00:08,859 --> 00:00:10,441
Previously on E. R.

3
00:00:10,442 --> 00:00:11,857
So what is my position here?

4
00:00:11,858 --> 00:00:13,953
You have no position here, Peter.

5
00:00:14,254 --> 00:00:16,937
- You're firing me?
- No, no, no, no.

6
00:00:17,418 --> 00:00:18,854
You fired yourself.

7
00:00:18,855 --> 00:00:21,140
- We're short on nurses.
- I'm an OB nurse.

8
00:00:21,141 --> 00:00:23,696
- Are you planning on going back to med school?
- Yes.

9
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:25,873
Ok, then you might as well work
as a nurse in the ER.

10
00:00:25,874 --> 00:00:28,015
You'll see more medicine down here
than upstairs.

11
00:00:28,016 --> 00:00:29,170
Listen, if you need anything...

12
00:00:29,171 --> 00:00:31,930
...talk about a case
or a patient or anything...

13
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:33,818
- ...just come find me.
- I will.

14
00:00:33,819 --> 00:00:36,293
You could be a great doctor.

15
00:00:40,054 --> 00:00:42,153
Oh, my God! I'm sorry.

16
00:00:42,154 --> 00:00:44,386
You're an excellent surgeon, Peter.

17
00:00:45,233 --> 00:00:48,785
And you're a good man,
and we'll work it out.

18
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,888
E. R. 7x04 "BENTON BACKWARDS"

19
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,017
I could come in for another interview.

20
00:00:55,186 --> 00:00:57,558
As a matter of fact,
I could come in this morning.

21
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:00,185
Yes, I know.
But you said you were interested.

22
00:01:00,357 --> 00:01:03,025
Actually, you said
you were very interested.

23
00:01:03,192 --> 00:01:05,480
Right. But if you could just-

24
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,688
Right, right, right. Thank you.

25
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:14,776
- Want some breakfast?
- No.

26
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:18,112
- Going over applications?
- Yep.

27
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,327
I thought you took
the position at Loyola.

28
00:01:20,404 --> 00:01:21,718
- Withdrawn.
- Why?

29
00:01:21,797 --> 00:01:25,281
I don't know, Cleo. Maybe because I
took another job somewhere else.

30
00:01:25,457 --> 00:01:27,615
- Have you tried Northwestern?
- Fully staffed.

31
00:01:27,792 --> 00:01:29,535
- U. of C.?
- What do you think?

32
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,876
Right now, I think you're being an ass.

33
00:01:33,046 --> 00:01:35,536
You barely say anything.
And when you do, it's rude.

34
00:01:35,715 --> 00:01:38,584
- I talk to you, Cleo.
- Not about this.

35
00:01:38,758 --> 00:01:43,086
- Why don't you let me help, Peter?
- I don't need your help. I need a job.

36
00:01:43,262 --> 00:01:46,215
I should have left County
when I had a chance.

37
00:01:50,975 --> 00:01:55,054
- Out for fresh air?
- Man found down. ETA is any minute.

38
00:01:55,228 --> 00:01:59,225
- They're letting you work on traumas.
- If I only handle two patients at a time.

39
00:01:59,398 --> 00:02:01,105
- Really?
- Weaver's rules.

40
00:02:01,274 --> 00:02:03,895
- Play by them or die by them.
- Thanks.

41
00:02:04,068 --> 00:02:08,396
She didn't exactly ask me
if I wanted to be assigned to the ER.

42
00:02:09,321 --> 00:02:12,108
What are you supposed to do
while you wait for labs?

43
00:02:12,282 --> 00:02:15,566
- Catch up on medical journals.
- That sucks.

44
00:02:16,618 --> 00:02:18,575
Showtime.

45
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:23,570
- You with me on this one?
- Male, 50, found in the park. Full arrest.

46
00:02:23,748 --> 00:02:25,906
- That's one well-fed bum.
- How'd you load him?

47
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:31,835
- Paid a bunch of his buddies 5 bucks.
- Come on. Let's go. One, two, three.

48
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,745
Large lac to the occipital scalp. Not sure
if he was rolled or fell out of his tree.

49
00:02:36,924 --> 00:02:38,880
- What's he doing in a tree?
- Maybe he lived in it.

50
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,378
Why didn't you intubate him?

51
00:02:40,551 --> 00:02:43,042
His neck's like a power pole.
We couldn't find the cords.

52
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,425
It was 40 degrees last night.
He's hypothermic.

53
00:02:45,596 --> 00:02:48,431
- We might still get him back.
- With what, a blowtorch?

54
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:51,764
Active core rewarming.
Set up for pleural and peritoneal lavage.

55
00:02:51,934 --> 00:02:54,092
All right, I'm in. Bag him.
Who's got scissors?

56
00:02:54,269 --> 00:02:57,803
Good air bilaterally. So, Carter,
you know anyone who plays hockey?

57
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,355
- No.
- Get me some warm blankets.

58
00:02:59,523 --> 00:03:01,930
- I need an extra guy for a game tonight.
- I'm busy.

59
00:03:02,108 --> 00:03:06,235
- I was asking if you knew anyone.
- Okay. Looks like we're in fine V-fib.

60
00:03:06,403 --> 00:03:08,857
- Core temp is 86.
- So is his pulse ox.

61
00:03:09,029 --> 00:03:11,602
- Charge the paddles to 360.
- Why? He's a frozen dinner.

62
00:03:11,781 --> 00:03:16,074
Put two chest tubes in on the right. Run
warm saline through the rapid infuser.

63
00:03:16,243 --> 00:03:18,863
- You're kidding.
- He's not dead until he's warm and dead.

64
00:03:19,036 --> 00:03:23,496
- I'll prep the chest. 32 French okay?
- Yeah. Okay, everybody clear.

65
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:27,288
- What the hell?
- Where did all the pigeons come from?

66
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:30,412
Give me an amp of epi.
All right. Charge again. Clear.

67
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:32,957
- They must have been in his coat.
- They're attacking.

68
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,160
Still in V-fib.

69
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,504
Damn it! Get over here and do CPR!
Charging to 360.

70
00:03:37,674 --> 00:03:39,334
Do CPR? The guy's brain-dead.

71
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:41,216
Not until I say so. Clear.

72
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,403
E. R.

73
00:04:35,506 --> 00:04:38,839
A bunch of beauty contestants were
in the salon getting final touches.

74
00:04:39,008 --> 00:04:41,166
A worker mixed the wrong
chemicals, and boom!

75
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:45,755
- Who's the worst?
- That'd be Audrey Hoffman, Miss Skokie.

76
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:49,796
Lacerations and partial-thickness
burns on her legs, and smoke inhalation.

77
00:04:49,974 --> 00:04:53,307
- Hi, Audrey. I'm Dr. Greene.
- My legs. Are they bad?

78
00:04:53,477 --> 00:04:56,761
I'm gonna check your breathing first.
Can you lean forward?

79
00:04:57,104 --> 00:04:59,345
- Any shortness of breath?
- No.

80
00:04:59,523 --> 00:05:03,306
- Uh-huh. Any chest pain?
- Not really.

81
00:05:03,484 --> 00:05:05,808
Miss Tri-State is tonight.

82
00:05:06,361 --> 00:05:07,475
Is it bad?

83
00:05:09,071 --> 00:05:11,644
Well, nothing that won't heal.

84
00:05:11,823 --> 00:05:16,199
- Does this mean that I'm out?
- We're gonna do everything we can.

85
00:05:17,744 --> 00:05:20,495
- What's your talent?
- Rhythmic dancing.

86
00:05:21,246 --> 00:05:23,285
With hoops and ribbons.

87
00:05:25,374 --> 00:05:28,327
Malik, how many times you gonna
pass by with the same cart?

88
00:05:28,501 --> 00:05:31,335
- I got a spot on my hockey team.
- Do I look like I play hockey?

89
00:05:31,503 --> 00:05:33,828
What about your pal in Cards?
Big East-Indian dude.

90
00:05:34,005 --> 00:05:36,673
I can skate. I played in college,
if you're in a pinch.

91
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,955
Yeah, yeah. Sure thing.

92
00:05:38,133 --> 00:05:41,714
Dr. Chen. Cute guy, Curtain 3,
daddy material. Just say thanks, okay?

93
00:05:41,885 --> 00:05:43,545
- Malucci, wait-
- Chen!

94
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,293
- What?
- Your mother's been holding 10 minutes.

95
00:05:46,472 --> 00:05:48,179
Not very pleasantly, I might add.

96
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,387
Just tell her I'm with a patient.
Thank you.

97
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:55,053
Lying might be part of your
job description. It's not part of mine.

98
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:57,307
Yeah. Hello, Mommy.

99
00:05:58,897 --> 00:06:00,177
Well, I've been busy.

100
00:06:00,357 --> 00:06:01,519
Morning, Dr. Weaver.

101
00:06:01,691 --> 00:06:04,181
- Frank, any messages?
- Yeah. Quite a few.

102
00:06:04,359 --> 00:06:06,019
- Thank you.
- Power meeting today?

103
00:06:06,194 --> 00:06:08,435
I have a seminar
that I do not have time for.

104
00:06:08,612 --> 00:06:11,103
Could you remind me
to leave by 6, please?

105
00:06:11,281 --> 00:06:14,400
- Seemed like a good idea at the time.
- Super glue.

106
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:17,030
- I hope that's one of two.
- The bird man still dead?

107
00:06:17,202 --> 00:06:19,526
It's one of one.
Are there any traumas coming in?

108
00:06:19,703 --> 00:06:24,115
No. But I've got a guy in Exam 3
who cut his hand on a tin can.

109
00:06:24,707 --> 00:06:27,114
Dr. Gottschalk, you have a minute?

110
00:06:27,292 --> 00:06:30,874
Unfortunately, I'm on my way
to a conference and I'm very late.

111
00:06:31,045 --> 00:06:34,744
I'll make this quick. I'd like to discuss
with you the faculty position here.

112
00:06:34,922 --> 00:06:37,495
- I really have to go.
- I just need a minute.

113
00:06:37,674 --> 00:06:39,832
I apologize for bothering
you like this, but-

114
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:42,879
After you turned us down,
we offered it to someone else.

115
00:06:43,053 --> 00:06:45,508
- Has it been accepted?
- Well, not officially.

116
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,048
- Then you can withdraw it.
- Our candidate has excellent credentials.

117
00:06:49,224 --> 00:06:52,259
- So do I.
- And he has positive recommendations.

118
00:06:52,434 --> 00:06:53,465
And I don't?

119
00:06:53,644 --> 00:06:56,513
I'm not at liberty to discuss
your current standing.

120
00:06:56,687 --> 00:06:59,557
- Which means Romano said something?
- I can't get into this.

121
00:06:59,731 --> 00:07:01,355
- What did he tell you?
- Dr. Benton-

122
00:07:01,524 --> 00:07:05,106
No. I need to know what that man said
and who he said it to.

123
00:07:05,277 --> 00:07:10,614
You may have difficulty finding work
locally. That's all I can say. I'm sorry.

124
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:15,071
- It's 1100 hours.
- Excuse me?

125
00:07:15,242 --> 00:07:16,522
I need to ship out.

126
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:20,401
Okay. Sir, if you're waiting
for a transfer to another facility...

127
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:22,322
...why don't we have a nurse help you.

128
00:07:22,497 --> 00:07:24,240
- We're taking Inchon!
- Inchon?

129
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:27,119
Korea. Huge battle, if memory serves.

130
00:07:27,292 --> 00:07:30,660
- Sorry. He's a wanderer.
- What's his story?

131
00:07:30,836 --> 00:07:34,334
72 years old, from the Golden Glen
Nursing Home. Altered mental status.

132
00:07:34,505 --> 00:07:36,877
He became combative
and got punched in the nose.

133
00:07:37,049 --> 00:07:38,163
History of dementia?

134
00:07:38,341 --> 00:07:40,547
No. The military talk
started a few days ago.

135
00:07:40,718 --> 00:07:42,959
- Anything on exam?
- His nose isn't broken.

136
00:07:43,136 --> 00:07:46,006
But he has a low-grade temp
with no obvious signs of infection.

137
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:50,473
CBC, Chem-7 and UA.
If his pulse ox is low, get a chest film.

138
00:07:50,808 --> 00:07:52,385
Damn tab busted off.

139
00:07:53,477 --> 00:07:55,469
You ever think about
using a can opener?

140
00:07:55,645 --> 00:07:58,100
Sure. But then what's the point
of having a tab?

141
00:07:59,606 --> 00:08:02,143
I started digging
around the edges there.

142
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,806
It looks to me like you may need
a few stitches.

143
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:08,317
Of course, the tuna juice leaks out.
And it gets greasy all over.

144
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:10,894
And then, bam!
The knife goes right into my hand.

145
00:08:12,865 --> 00:08:16,316
I'm going to do a regional block
to numb the area...

146
00:08:16,493 --> 00:08:18,401
...around where I'm gonna be suturing.

147
00:08:18,577 --> 00:08:20,949
Are you sure you've done this before?

148
00:08:21,121 --> 00:08:23,658
Sorry. I need some I and D kits.

149
00:08:25,499 --> 00:08:27,621
You might feel a little burning.

150
00:08:29,418 --> 00:08:31,956
I'm going to the 8:00 tonight, Abby.
How about you?

151
00:08:32,295 --> 00:08:34,003
I don't know. Maybe.

152
00:08:38,174 --> 00:08:40,332
The exact same thing happened
when I tried...

153
00:08:40,509 --> 00:08:42,916
...to open a milk carton
with a pair of scissors.

154
00:08:43,095 --> 00:08:47,173
The bruises sort of sprang up overnight.
That's why I brought him in here.

155
00:08:47,347 --> 00:08:49,754
He has Niemann-Pick's Type A.

156
00:08:49,933 --> 00:08:53,347
I have some material here,
if you're not familiar.

157
00:08:53,518 --> 00:08:56,269
Oh, no. That won't be necessary.

158
00:08:57,021 --> 00:08:59,511
His liver and spleen are both enlarged.

159
00:08:59,689 --> 00:09:02,642
That's from the sphingomyelin deposits
in both organs.

160
00:09:02,817 --> 00:09:06,231
Well, a big spleen chews up platelets.
That's why he's bleeding.

161
00:09:06,402 --> 00:09:10,019
- Is there anything we can do?
- We can make him more comfortable.

162
00:09:10,197 --> 00:09:13,979
- I'll start him on some morphine.
- Would that make him unconscious?

163
00:09:14,158 --> 00:09:17,442
Because I want him to be lucid
for as long as he can be.

164
00:09:18,536 --> 00:09:20,824
It'll be a very small dose of medicine.

165
00:09:20,996 --> 00:09:24,660
What about the spleen?
You said that's causing the problem.

166
00:09:24,832 --> 00:09:28,366
Well, if it's taken out,
that might help stop the bleeding...

167
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:31,455
...but you do know
your son is end-stage?

168
00:09:31,628 --> 00:09:33,537
Yes.

169
00:09:35,798 --> 00:09:40,672
We'll get an ultrasound of his abdomen,
and I'll have a surgeon come take a look.

170
00:09:40,843 --> 00:09:44,258
- Thank you.
- Okay. You're welcome.

171
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:53,848
Dr. Chen? I usually wait for labs
to come back before consulting Surgery.

172
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:58,062
He's got splenomegaly. Pretty clear case
of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia.

173
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,977
- I thought you said he was end-stage.
- It doesn't mean he can't have surgery.

174
00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:05,648
I'd think about whether it's
appropriate at this point.

175
00:10:11,072 --> 00:10:13,397
- Hi.
- Hi.

176
00:10:13,574 --> 00:10:15,447
I need to get...

177
00:10:15,992 --> 00:10:17,652
Thanks.

178
00:10:19,787 --> 00:10:21,280
- Abby?
- Yeah.

179
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:25,285
- You have a feather.
- I have a...

180
00:10:27,834 --> 00:10:29,707
We had these...

181
00:10:30,586 --> 00:10:32,542
Thank you.

182
00:10:36,673 --> 00:10:38,416
What?

183
00:10:40,593 --> 00:10:42,668
I was just thinking...

184
00:10:42,844 --> 00:10:46,923
I was just wondering, if you wanted,
maybe we could...

185
00:10:48,431 --> 00:10:50,009
We could what?

186
00:10:52,101 --> 00:10:53,725
Go out sometime.

187
00:10:55,603 --> 00:10:58,354
Oh, you mean, like a date?

188
00:10:59,898 --> 00:11:04,108
Yeah. That's sort of
what I was thinking.

189
00:11:06,527 --> 00:11:08,436
Tonight?

190
00:11:10,822 --> 00:11:11,936
Sure. Tonight works.

191
00:11:12,532 --> 00:11:14,773
- Okay.
- Okay.

192
00:11:16,784 --> 00:11:18,990
- See you then.
- Okay.

193
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:27,869
Romano.

194
00:11:28,042 --> 00:11:31,245
- Peter, back for a visit? How are you?
- How the hell do you think I am?

195
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,585
Well, judging by your demeanor,
I'd say you were a tad dyspeptic.

196
00:11:34,755 --> 00:11:37,958
- You've been trashing me all over town?
- Having trouble landing a job?

197
00:11:38,133 --> 00:11:39,840
- Thanks to you.
- I'm offended.

198
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:42,131
You've made enemies
all over this hospital.

199
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:44,294
Why assume I'm the only one
saying negative-?

200
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,462
You're preventing me
from earning a living.

201
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,512
No, actually, I'm willing to help.

202
00:11:48,682 --> 00:11:52,630
- What?
- Your personality sucks...

203
00:11:52,809 --> 00:11:54,801
...but you don't have to prove
that you're a great surgeon.

204
00:11:54,978 --> 00:11:58,096
Now, I am willing to offer you
a per diem position.

205
00:11:58,272 --> 00:11:59,434
- Per diem?
- Yeah.

206
00:11:59,606 --> 00:12:03,898
It has no benefits and even less stature,
but it's yours for the asking.

207
00:12:06,319 --> 00:12:08,774
- You can kiss my ass.
- I take it that's a "no"?

208
00:12:08,946 --> 00:12:12,645
You couldn't pay me enough to work
for you again, you arrogant little prick.

209
00:12:12,823 --> 00:12:15,989
Fair enough. Just keep working
on those people skills, Peter.

210
00:12:18,911 --> 00:12:21,117
- Labs are back on Mr. Mellonston.
- Good.

211
00:12:21,288 --> 00:12:23,078
- Great color.
- Thanks.

212
00:12:23,247 --> 00:12:26,746
UA's full of white cells. He's got
a rip-roaring urinary-tract infection.

213
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:28,410
Sorry I called you prematurely.

214
00:12:28,584 --> 00:12:30,623
Always happens
with nursing-home patients.

215
00:12:30,794 --> 00:12:34,743
Give an old guy a bad UTI, next thing
you know, he's General MacArthur.

216
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:38,669
I called the home, and they've
already given his bed away.

217
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:42,968
- Family members who can take him in?
- He's at the mercy of Social Services.

218
00:12:43,136 --> 00:12:46,089
Hey, back to work! Get back to work!
Come on. Show's over.

219
00:12:46,263 --> 00:12:50,723
Maybe not. He talks like a vet.
If he is one, he could qualify for the VA.

220
00:12:50,891 --> 00:12:52,800
Yeah. That'll take days to process.

221
00:12:53,143 --> 00:12:57,186
I know a caseworker at North Chicago
with pull. Maybe we can transfer today.

222
00:12:57,354 --> 00:13:00,058
- Do you want me to call?
- Sure, if you think it can be done.

223
00:13:00,231 --> 00:13:02,768
Anybody missing an old man
looking for brass cleaner?

224
00:13:02,941 --> 00:13:04,933
He just walked into a pelvic exam.

225
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,603
Mr. Mellonston!

226
00:13:07,611 --> 00:13:09,438
Mr. Mellonston?

227
00:13:09,613 --> 00:13:12,103
- Kerry. Hold on.
- Peter, I thought you'd left us.

228
00:13:12,281 --> 00:13:14,439
I could be talked
into coming down to the ER.

229
00:13:14,616 --> 00:13:16,941
- As an Attending?
- As a liaison to Surgery.

230
00:13:17,118 --> 00:13:21,328
As a resident you went out of your way
to take every procedure away from us.

231
00:13:21,496 --> 00:13:24,864
If you had a surgeon teaching residents,
more procedures would stay here.

232
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,866
- How?
- I could expedite cases to the O. R.

233
00:13:27,042 --> 00:13:28,701
We have surgical residents for that.

234
00:13:28,876 --> 00:13:31,710
Could you tell me if there's
an elderly gentleman in there?

235
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:33,538
- Does 47 count?
- No. Thank you.

236
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:35,207
See, I could do scheduling and-

237
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:37,918
- God knows we could use the help.
- Kerry, hire me.

238
00:13:38,091 --> 00:13:42,253
Look, I'd love to. Get Romano to pay
for it, you got yourself a job.

239
00:13:42,427 --> 00:13:44,752
Trolling for work, Peter?

240
00:13:47,723 --> 00:13:51,636
Dr. Chen. I'm interested to see what
required the interruption of my lunch.

241
00:13:51,809 --> 00:13:55,093
As I explained on the phone,
splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia.

242
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:57,261
- So you'll operate?
- Well... no.

243
00:13:57,438 --> 00:14:00,307
I would if he didn't have Niemann-Pick's.
Snow him and wait.

244
00:14:00,481 --> 00:14:02,604
We can't just let him
slowly bleed to death.

245
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:06,439
It's a terminal disease. Surgery will
only slightly delay the inevitable.

246
00:14:06,611 --> 00:14:10,477
If the surgery were successful, then the
family would have more time with him.

247
00:14:10,655 --> 00:14:13,489
And if wishes were horses,
we'd all be knee-deep in crap.

248
00:14:13,657 --> 00:14:16,194
I didn't become a surgeon
to torture dying children.

249
00:14:16,367 --> 00:14:19,321
- Let the boy die in peace.
- But the mother wants it.

250
00:14:19,495 --> 00:14:22,329
No surgery, Dr. Chen.

251
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:28,205
- What the hell is this?
- Explosion at a hair salon.

252
00:14:28,376 --> 00:14:33,617
Sad cultural commentary, isn't it?
Pursuit of beauty at all costs.

253
00:14:33,921 --> 00:14:35,036
Nice legs, though.

254
00:14:35,214 --> 00:14:37,005
There you go.

255
00:14:37,632 --> 00:14:41,629
- Oh, God! What am I going to do?
- It probably won't scar.

256
00:14:41,802 --> 00:14:44,553
But they look hideous.
I can't go on stage like this.

257
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,302
- Can you wear pants?
- Not in the swimsuit competition.

258
00:14:48,473 --> 00:14:50,679
You know, you probably think
this is so stupid.

259
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:54,716
I'm just trying to win a scholarship.
I'm premed.

260
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,884
I can give you something
for the pain if you'd like.

261
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,553
It's okay.
They look worse than they feel.

262
00:15:00,732 --> 00:15:03,436
Okay. Excuse me.

263
00:15:03,609 --> 00:15:06,063
Can you get ahold of Miss Pruitt
at Abbott and Sons?

264
00:15:06,235 --> 00:15:09,319
- Oh, yeah. Miss Pruitt. You mean that-
- Don't ask. Just do it.

265
00:15:09,488 --> 00:15:11,978
Hey, Dave? Did you find anybody yet?

266
00:15:12,156 --> 00:15:13,733
- For what?
- For hockey tonight.

267
00:15:13,907 --> 00:15:18,983
Yeah. A friend of mine. He might sign on.
Former pro, just looking for exercise.

268
00:15:19,161 --> 00:15:20,192
Oh, okay.

269
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:23,738
- It's a rough game we play, actually-
- So you don't think I can handle it.

270
00:15:23,914 --> 00:15:27,531
- I didn't say that.
- I used to play varsity, second line.

271
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:30,874
Well, if he can't make it, I'll call you.

272
00:15:31,044 --> 00:15:34,827
Type and cross for four. Start two units
of O-neg on the rapid infuser.

273
00:15:35,005 --> 00:15:38,539
- What happened?
- Multiple GSWs, one to the chest.

274
00:15:38,716 --> 00:15:40,543
Looks like a hemopneumothorax.

275
00:15:40,718 --> 00:15:43,089
Five hundred cc's out.

276
00:15:43,553 --> 00:15:47,763
- Lost the pulse. Starting compressions.
- We need to crack her chest.

277
00:15:48,265 --> 00:15:52,178
Right-sided GSW's an indication
for the sternal saw. Can I do it?

278
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:55,137
Next time, Carter. 10 blade.

279
00:15:56,896 --> 00:15:58,934
Hold CPR.

280
00:16:00,565 --> 00:16:02,391
Sternal saw.

281
00:16:04,984 --> 00:16:07,557
- She needs a central line.
- I'll do it.

282
00:16:09,821 --> 00:16:11,897
Mr. Mellonston?

283
00:16:12,114 --> 00:16:14,486
Mr. Mellonston?

284
00:16:15,242 --> 00:16:17,068
Mr. Mellonston.

285
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:23,114
He said he lost his razor on Old Baldy,
wanted to borrow mine.

286
00:16:23,664 --> 00:16:28,325
Gil didn't really need it though.
All he had was peach fuzz.

287
00:16:28,501 --> 00:16:31,073
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

288
00:16:31,253 --> 00:16:34,253
A mortar shell took his head off.

289
00:16:34,422 --> 00:16:37,505
Why don't we take you back
to your bed so you can rest, okay?

290
00:16:37,674 --> 00:16:39,251
Here we go.

291
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:46,418
- You've seen war, haven't you?
- Actually, no. I have not.

292
00:16:48,098 --> 00:16:50,422
But you've seen men die.

293
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,428
Yes.

294
00:16:55,103 --> 00:17:00,724
Mr. Mellonston, I'm afraid I have
some rather unfortunate news.

295
00:17:00,898 --> 00:17:02,937
You've lost your bed
at the nursing home.

296
00:17:03,108 --> 00:17:06,310
But we've already called the VA
to see if we can find a placement.

297
00:17:06,485 --> 00:17:08,857
- They won't take me!
- I'm sure that you qualify.

298
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:10,606
- I won't go there!
- Please try-

299
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,864
- I can't go there! I won't!
- Calm down. We're only trying to help.

300
00:17:14,032 --> 00:17:17,151
- I can't go there! I won't!
- Malik! Malik, come over-!

301
00:17:18,077 --> 00:17:20,614
No, please!
Don't let them take me!

302
00:17:20,787 --> 00:17:24,700
Don't let them take me away.
Please.

303
00:17:28,334 --> 00:17:31,951
His nose stopped bleeding.
What'd you find out?

304
00:17:34,422 --> 00:17:39,545
Well, the surgeon feels that it's
too great a risk to operate on Kenneth.

305
00:17:39,717 --> 00:17:41,958
But he's suffering.
Can't you see that?

306
00:17:42,135 --> 00:17:44,672
Ms. Stein,
Kenneth is barely conscious.

307
00:17:44,845 --> 00:17:48,972
That's not true! He squeezes my hand.
He understands me.

308
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,140
That means everything that
can be done should be done.

309
00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:56,637
Yes. But there's a good chance that
Kenneth won't survive the operation.

310
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,310
I know what you're thinking.

311
00:18:00,481 --> 00:18:02,224
I'm selfish.

312
00:18:02,775 --> 00:18:05,063
I'm keeping my son alive for me,
not him.

313
00:18:05,235 --> 00:18:07,807
- Ms. Stein, I'm not thinking-
- He's my child.

314
00:18:08,904 --> 00:18:12,402
I want every minute I can with him.

315
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:17,236
Wait till you're a mother,
then you'll know.

316
00:18:17,993 --> 00:18:19,653
Get him the surgery.

317
00:18:21,704 --> 00:18:25,321
Looks like a small-caliber GSW
to the right ventricle.

318
00:18:25,499 --> 00:18:27,989
Okay. That should do it.

319
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:36,630
- Heart's not filling.
- She's had five units.

320
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:39,335
- We need more volume.
- Prep the paddles.

321
00:18:39,508 --> 00:18:43,125
Can't shock an empty heart.
You'll never get her back.

322
00:18:43,803 --> 00:18:47,136
- Run in another two units.
- Give me some 0 silk.

323
00:18:47,305 --> 00:18:50,508
- Hold compressions.
- What are you doing, Carter?

324
00:18:50,808 --> 00:18:52,883
Beck's suture.

325
00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:57,222
All right. Keep traction on that.
I'll check the back side of the heart.

326
00:18:57,396 --> 00:18:59,269
What do you see?

327
00:19:00,231 --> 00:19:03,397
Exit wound in the left ventricle.
Give me 2-0 silk.

328
00:19:03,567 --> 00:19:05,642
- I can repair it.
- Not from that side.

329
00:19:05,818 --> 00:19:07,395
I have a better angle here.

330
00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:13,735
I saw blood welling up behind the heart.
I thought there might be another hole.

331
00:19:14,032 --> 00:19:16,108
- Okay.
- Charge to 20.

332
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,940
Okay, now cut it.

333
00:19:23,414 --> 00:19:24,742
Clear.

334
00:19:25,374 --> 00:19:27,200
Still V-fib.

335
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,367
Okay. Charge to 30. Clear.

336
00:19:31,586 --> 00:19:33,958
Got a rhythm. Sinus tach.

337
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:36,620
- Got a pulse.
- Nice job, Carter.

338
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,504
Notify the O.R. She's got
a septal defect they need to repair.

339
00:19:40,676 --> 00:19:44,589
Dr. Kovac, Mrs. Danzer's having more
chest pain, dropped her pressure to 90.

340
00:19:44,762 --> 00:19:47,548
I'll be right there.
Are you gonna take her up?

341
00:19:47,722 --> 00:19:51,304
Sterile saline dressings
and hang the FFP.

342
00:19:51,475 --> 00:19:54,808
- Great save, Carter. Very slick.
- Thanks.

343
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:59,224
- Ativan?
- Yeah, point 5. He's pretty subdued.

344
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:09,196
- Did you hear from the VA?
- There's good news and bad news.

345
00:20:09,362 --> 00:20:13,822
I found Mr. Mellonston a bed.
But it's in a brig. He's AWOL.

346
00:20:14,741 --> 00:20:16,567
AWOL? From where?

347
00:20:16,743 --> 00:20:21,202
Korean War. 1951, Army corporal.
Deserted on leave.

348
00:20:21,371 --> 00:20:25,533
Unfortunately, my VA contact took it
upon himself to notify the active military.

349
00:20:25,707 --> 00:20:28,577
Why would they care about someone
who deserted 50 years ago?

350
00:20:28,751 --> 00:20:31,241
Who knows? They may want
to slap him on the wrist.

351
00:20:31,419 --> 00:20:35,250
- They may want to court-martial him.
- For God's sake! He's 72 years old.

352
00:20:35,422 --> 00:20:36,620
I know.

353
00:20:37,924 --> 00:20:42,798
- Is there anything we can do?
- Legally? No.

354
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,097
Peter, what are you doing here?

355
00:20:52,434 --> 00:20:54,260
Did you get any of my messages?

356
00:20:54,435 --> 00:20:58,930
Yes. And I meant to call you.
I've just been incredibly busy.

357
00:21:02,149 --> 00:21:04,604
I just didn't know what to say.

358
00:21:04,984 --> 00:21:06,775
Yeah. Well, it's okay.

359
00:21:06,944 --> 00:21:11,071
No. No, it's not okay.
I've been avoiding you for days.

360
00:21:11,447 --> 00:21:12,692
Yeah. I got that.

361
00:21:15,033 --> 00:21:19,029
I'm sorry. What Robert did was wrong.
And I've told him as much.

362
00:21:19,203 --> 00:21:21,325
I just wish there was
something I could do.

363
00:21:21,496 --> 00:21:24,828
Well, I didn't exactly expect you
to resign in protest.

364
00:21:24,998 --> 00:21:26,990
That's a relief.

365
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,787
There is something you can do.
You can put the word out.

366
00:21:30,961 --> 00:21:33,795
I know you've got a lot of contacts
at other hospitals.

367
00:21:33,963 --> 00:21:37,413
Of course. I'm surprised you
haven't been snapped up already.

368
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:42,381
Yeah. Well, it seems that lately
my reputation has taken a hit.

369
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:45,799
He's a horrid little turd, isn't he?

370
00:21:48,264 --> 00:21:52,640
You know what? I spoke with a friend in
Philadelphia who's looking for someone.

371
00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:57,055
- I just wasn't sure you'd care to move.
- At this point, I'm open to anything.

372
00:21:57,229 --> 00:22:01,475
- Dr. Benton, they need you in the ER.
- I no longer work at this hospital.

373
00:22:01,649 --> 00:22:04,981
Weaver called.
Your sister Jackie is down there.

374
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,146
- What was the last BP?
-100/60.

375
00:22:10,321 --> 00:22:13,855
- Okay, let's go.
- I'll grab the drug box.

376
00:22:15,075 --> 00:22:16,403
- How is she?
- Who are you?

377
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,820
Her sister.

378
00:22:17,993 --> 00:22:20,234
She was shot in the chest.
She's critical.

379
00:22:20,412 --> 00:22:22,984
She needs surgery.
You can go wait in the-

380
00:22:26,499 --> 00:22:29,120
- Oh, Lord!
- What happened?

381
00:22:30,502 --> 00:22:34,201
- Call Security now!
- Oh, my God! Carter! Are you all right?

382
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:37,629
- Heart stopped beating.
- I'll start compressions.

383
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:40,834
- Any rhythm?
- Agonal at 34. Looks like P.E.A.

384
00:22:41,009 --> 00:22:43,582
Amp of atropine, amp of epi.
Mix up the dopamine.

385
00:22:43,761 --> 00:22:45,919
That girl must've been a gangbanger.

386
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,554
Chest is dry.

387
00:22:48,098 --> 00:22:51,964
Pupils are fixed and dilated.
There's gray matter everywhere.

388
00:22:52,142 --> 00:22:54,597
You won't get her back.
Blew her brains out.

389
00:22:54,769 --> 00:22:56,891
Hyperventilators, 70 of mannitol.

390
00:22:57,062 --> 00:22:59,268
Check cold-water calorics,
and we'll call it.

391
00:22:59,439 --> 00:23:01,016
Somebody call the police!

392
00:23:07,278 --> 00:23:09,104
- What happened?
- Jesse got into a fight.

393
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:10,477
You don't know, all right?

394
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:12,694
I was surprised when
they said you were here.

395
00:23:12,865 --> 00:23:14,821
I had to take care of something.
How is he?

396
00:23:14,991 --> 00:23:18,489
Superficial lac above the eyebrow,
mild periorbital swelling...

397
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:21,032
...but no bony deformity or tenderness.

398
00:23:21,204 --> 00:23:23,077
- Nothing serious.
- Told you.

399
00:23:23,247 --> 00:23:27,742
- He was bleeding pretty bad.
- Did you hit your head? Pass out?

400
00:23:27,917 --> 00:23:31,367
He slammed me into the locker once,
all right? That's all.

401
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:33,786
- You get a CT?
- No. You think he needs one?

402
00:23:33,963 --> 00:23:34,994
Maybe.

403
00:23:35,172 --> 00:23:38,338
There was no LOC,
no focal neuro deficits.

404
00:23:38,508 --> 00:23:40,713
With head injuries,
you can't be too careful.

405
00:23:40,884 --> 00:23:44,003
Jackie, he's fine. He's fine.

406
00:23:46,555 --> 00:23:49,721
Come on. Hey, Jackie.
How about I buy you a cup of coffee?

407
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:51,550
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Come on.

408
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:02,564
- How are you doing?
- I'm okay.

409
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:07,102
- They found the shooter.
- Good.

410
00:24:07,277 --> 00:24:09,566
Only 15 years old.

411
00:24:11,197 --> 00:24:12,988
Why don't you go home?

412
00:24:14,366 --> 00:24:16,157
I'll be all right.

413
00:24:16,325 --> 00:24:21,745
Go home. You've probably seen
enough trauma for one day.

414
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:28,865
I'll tell Kerry.

415
00:24:38,716 --> 00:24:41,337
- He's a teenager. It's normal stuff.
- No, he's changed.

416
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:43,751
You're just not around enough
to notice anymore.

417
00:24:43,928 --> 00:24:44,959
What does that mean?

418
00:24:45,137 --> 00:24:47,841
He's got a girlfriend now.
She's pretty rough.

419
00:24:48,014 --> 00:24:50,302
- You try talking to him?
- We've tried everything.

420
00:24:50,474 --> 00:24:52,680
Grounding him is a joke.
He goes out anyway.

421
00:24:52,851 --> 00:24:55,970
I can't have him locked up.
The other day he shoved his father.

422
00:24:56,145 --> 00:24:58,682
Took everything Walter had not to-

423
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,398
You all right?

424
00:25:05,318 --> 00:25:07,606
Can you talk to him?

425
00:25:08,195 --> 00:25:09,653
Can you try?

426
00:25:09,946 --> 00:25:11,985
Talking to him?

427
00:25:13,031 --> 00:25:15,522
Maybe he'll listen to you.

428
00:25:21,954 --> 00:25:25,453
- You look nice.
- Thank you. You too.

429
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:28,707
So, what did you have in mind?
Dinner? Movie?

430
00:25:28,876 --> 00:25:31,544
I was thinking of something
a little more physical.

431
00:25:31,711 --> 00:25:33,917
Not if you go in laparoscopically.

432
00:25:34,088 --> 00:25:36,578
Recovery time is reduced
and he gains back weeks...

433
00:25:36,756 --> 00:25:38,795
...maybe even months of his life.

434
00:25:39,341 --> 00:25:44,132
I don't understand. Are you saying it's
too risky for you or for the patient?

435
00:25:45,304 --> 00:25:47,510
Yeah, whatever. Thank you.

436
00:25:48,014 --> 00:25:50,551
- Problems?
- Can't find a surgeon.

437
00:25:50,724 --> 00:25:53,641
- Is our department booked?
- No. Just uninterested.

438
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:56,561
- This your kid with Niemann-Pick's?
- Yeah.

439
00:25:56,728 --> 00:25:58,388
Tough situation.

440
00:25:58,897 --> 00:26:01,303
I all but promised his mother
I'd make this happen.

441
00:26:01,482 --> 00:26:04,980
- Now you can't?
- There are a few other people I can try.

442
00:26:05,151 --> 00:26:07,641
But you know they'll turn you down.

443
00:26:07,819 --> 00:26:13,405
You know, sometimes as much as we
like to give it, hope can be cruel.

444
00:26:14,908 --> 00:26:16,152
Dr. Greene.

445
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:18,941
Think fast!

446
00:26:25,957 --> 00:26:28,163
8:00, tonight. You're in.

447
00:26:29,585 --> 00:26:31,707
I can't believe the VA
is moving this quickly.

448
00:26:31,878 --> 00:26:33,751
They're not.
I got him into another home.

449
00:26:33,921 --> 00:26:36,755
Borrowed a Social Security number
from a corpse at the morgue.

450
00:26:36,923 --> 00:26:38,500
- Sour cream and onion?
- No, thank you.

451
00:26:38,674 --> 00:26:40,750
You borrowed a number
from a deceased person?

452
00:26:40,926 --> 00:26:43,630
- Yeah. We do it all the time.
- I don't wanna know this.

453
00:26:43,803 --> 00:26:46,127
- You said you felt bad.
- That is not the point.

454
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:49,091
I work with many elderly homeless.
You learn a few tricks.

455
00:26:49,265 --> 00:26:51,008
- Not another word, please!
- You have to.

456
00:26:51,183 --> 00:26:53,887
- Dr. Weaver, time for that seminar.
- Thank you, Frank.

457
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,977
- "Advances in Neuroleptic Therapy"?
- Yeah. How did you know?

458
00:26:57,145 --> 00:26:59,517
I'll be there. Save you a seat.

459
00:27:00,356 --> 00:27:04,399
- So where is this body?
- The patient is right here.

460
00:27:04,567 --> 00:27:06,144
- Audrey?
- Can I go home now?

461
00:27:06,318 --> 00:27:09,105
Not yet. This is Miss Pruitt,
and she's here to help you.

462
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,773
She's an expert cosmetologist.

463
00:27:10,947 --> 00:27:13,437
Can you cover all of this
in time for the pageant?

464
00:27:13,615 --> 00:27:18,110
- Honey, I've worked on worse. Trust me.
- Yeah, but I've got open wounds.

465
00:27:18,285 --> 00:27:22,495
You're on antibiotics. But afterwards,
no makeup until you're fully healed.

466
00:27:22,663 --> 00:27:24,489
- Thank you, Dr. Greene.
- Good luck.

467
00:27:24,664 --> 00:27:25,695
Thanks.

468
00:27:25,874 --> 00:27:28,328
Isn't that the gal who does makeup
on dead people?

469
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,579
Whatever works.

470
00:27:29,751 --> 00:27:33,534
Mark, there you are. You know we
were meant to leave half an hour ago?

471
00:27:33,712 --> 00:27:36,119
- For what?
- We're looking at artwork tonight.

472
00:27:36,298 --> 00:27:38,373
- I'm subbing in a hockey game.
- What?

473
00:27:38,549 --> 00:27:41,549
- Malucci. He asked me to play hockey.
- Malucci? Are you mad?

474
00:27:42,635 --> 00:27:44,010
What?

475
00:27:44,178 --> 00:27:46,751
You never said one word to me
about hockey before.

476
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:48,721
You never asked.

477
00:27:50,015 --> 00:27:54,391
- Do you play well?
- Well, why don't you come find out?

478
00:27:56,979 --> 00:27:59,647
You could wear your sweater,
you could bring some pompoms.

479
00:27:59,814 --> 00:28:01,356
I'd be in uniform.

480
00:28:01,523 --> 00:28:05,140
I didn't know sports
had this effect on you.

481
00:28:19,244 --> 00:28:22,908
- Has something happened?
- No, why?

482
00:28:23,288 --> 00:28:26,158
- You're home early.
- Yep.

483
00:28:26,541 --> 00:28:31,166
- You never leave the hospital early.
- Someone fax you my schedule?

484
00:28:31,878 --> 00:28:36,254
I know when you left this morning.
And I know the kind of hours you put in.

485
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,415
It was slow, so they sent me home.

486
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:41,336
- So it's been all right?
- Yep.

487
00:28:41,509 --> 00:28:45,423
- What you expected?
- I'm hungry.

488
00:28:45,596 --> 00:28:48,631
How about you? Have you eaten?
I'll take you to Dominic's.

489
00:28:48,806 --> 00:28:54,261
John, to be honest, I hoped that you
would feel so uncomfortable there...

490
00:28:54,435 --> 00:28:56,261
...that you wouldn't want to stay.

491
00:28:56,436 --> 00:28:59,970
- I know.
- So I wouldn't have to ask you not to.

492
00:29:00,147 --> 00:29:02,982
Well, then don't. Just give me
five minutes. I'll get changed.

493
00:29:03,149 --> 00:29:04,857
John.

494
00:29:06,152 --> 00:29:08,274
I know your heart is in the right place.

495
00:29:08,445 --> 00:29:12,655
I know you enjoy being a doctor.
Start a practice.

496
00:29:12,823 --> 00:29:14,945
I'm not fighting you on that anymore.

497
00:29:15,116 --> 00:29:17,274
Can't we just agree
to disagree on this?

498
00:29:17,451 --> 00:29:21,068
No. There are other ways
to help people.

499
00:29:21,245 --> 00:29:23,154
You don't have to destroy yourself.

500
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:26,615
- Gamma-
- That place nearly killed you, John.

501
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:31,117
It killed your friend.
It drove you to drugs.

502
00:29:31,294 --> 00:29:34,993
- No. I did that on my own.
- You don't owe them anything.

503
00:29:35,172 --> 00:29:39,334
You don't have to prove anything.
You have a beautiful spirit.

504
00:29:39,508 --> 00:29:42,378
I've seen them beat
that spirit out of you.

505
00:29:42,552 --> 00:29:47,461
Gamma, I'm gonna be fine.
I promise.

506
00:29:49,557 --> 00:29:52,308
I wish I could believe you.

507
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,602
Gamma?

508
00:30:03,275 --> 00:30:05,599
Wait. Stop spinning.
You're not supposed to spin.

509
00:30:05,776 --> 00:30:08,349
How am I supposed to keep you from...?

510
00:30:12,656 --> 00:30:15,490
- It's all in the wrists, really.
- I think I pulled a muscle.

511
00:30:15,658 --> 00:30:18,907
- Oh, maybe we should take a break.
- Good idea.

512
00:30:24,164 --> 00:30:25,409
Draft, please. Abby?

513
00:30:25,582 --> 00:30:28,451
- Oh, can I have a club soda?
- Club soda.

514
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:33,001
So next time I choose the sport.
Something more civilized.

515
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:36,289
- Such as...?
- There's a pool table at my hotel.

516
00:30:37,006 --> 00:30:41,667
- Your hotel?
- Yeah. I don't own it. I just live there.

517
00:30:41,843 --> 00:30:44,250
- You live in a hotel?
- Yeah. As a doctor.

518
00:30:44,595 --> 00:30:48,543
I take care of the tourists.
They give me a break on the rent.

519
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:55,767
No, it's a good deal. I mean,
maid service, laundry, amenities...

520
00:30:56,103 --> 00:30:59,637
No, it's great.
You'll have to come see it.

521
00:30:59,814 --> 00:31:01,972
- Your hotel room?
- Yeah.

522
00:31:02,357 --> 00:31:05,026
I mean- I mean, no. I mean-

523
00:31:05,192 --> 00:31:08,027
I'd never ask such a thing of a lady.

524
00:31:08,195 --> 00:31:12,855
- Well, especially after just one kiss.
- No. I should hope not.

525
00:31:28,709 --> 00:31:31,662
Of course, that makes it two.

526
00:31:33,379 --> 00:31:35,205
Come on, rematch.

527
00:31:37,965 --> 00:31:42,128
- We out of here, or not?
- Yeah. After we talk.

528
00:31:42,302 --> 00:31:43,843
About what?

529
00:31:44,845 --> 00:31:47,514
Your mom says you've been
hanging out a lot lately.

530
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,550
- So?
- So she worries about you.

531
00:31:50,724 --> 00:31:54,306
She worries about everything.
That's what she does.

532
00:31:54,518 --> 00:31:58,218
- You got new friends?
- New girl. That's it.

533
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,850
- Using a condom?
- Uncle Peter-

534
00:32:02,024 --> 00:32:05,356
- I'm serious.
- I'm not stupid.

535
00:32:06,944 --> 00:32:08,058
Good.

536
00:32:11,864 --> 00:32:14,401
I'm not doing anything, all right?

537
00:32:14,574 --> 00:32:18,321
It's just...
I'm a man, you know?

538
00:32:18,493 --> 00:32:22,276
And my folks just can't get
used to it. That's all.

539
00:32:22,996 --> 00:32:26,080
Well, maybe they would
if you treated them with respect.

540
00:32:26,249 --> 00:32:28,324
You mean do what they say.

541
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,915
Look, sometimes you gotta do
what you don't wanna do.

542
00:32:32,086 --> 00:32:34,078
That's part of being a man.

543
00:32:34,254 --> 00:32:39,591
- Peter, do you have a minute?
- Yeah. Hold on a second, okay?

544
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:42,758
Just do what your mother says.
All right?

545
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,098
- That job's yours if you want it.
- Are you serious?

546
00:32:55,269 --> 00:32:58,435
You're a full Surgical Attending
on the academic track.

547
00:32:58,605 --> 00:33:00,347
- Thank you.
- I'm so happy for you.

548
00:33:00,523 --> 00:33:03,439
- What's all the celebrating about?
- I got a job.

549
00:33:03,608 --> 00:33:04,853
That's great!

550
00:33:05,026 --> 00:33:07,314
Elizabeth pulled some strings
with her friend.

551
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:08,517
Where?

552
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,770
Hahnemann.
They made me a full Attending.

553
00:33:10,946 --> 00:33:12,144
In Philadelphia.

554
00:33:12,322 --> 00:33:15,773
- Anyway, he's expecting your call.
- Oh. Right, right. Thanks.

555
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,325
Sure.

556
00:33:19,286 --> 00:33:22,618
I didn't have much of a choice.
I mean, I'm being blackballed here.

557
00:33:22,788 --> 00:33:25,705
- When will I see you?
- Well, it's only an hour by air.

558
00:33:25,873 --> 00:33:28,364
- We'll work something out.
- I guess so.

559
00:33:28,542 --> 00:33:31,079
- You coming home with us?
- No, I gotta make a stop.

560
00:33:31,252 --> 00:33:33,956
- Can you do me a favor and take him?
- Of course.

561
00:33:37,757 --> 00:33:39,749
I'll call you.

562
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:42,957
Okay.

563
00:33:43,135 --> 00:33:44,713
- What?
- All I'm saying is:

564
00:33:44,887 --> 00:33:47,092
You were at four
and then you were at six.

565
00:33:47,263 --> 00:33:51,474
That's because I scored very quickly.
You're a bad sport.

566
00:33:51,641 --> 00:33:55,258
- I can't handle losing to a girl, okay?
- Oh, no.

567
00:33:55,436 --> 00:33:58,008
I'm kidding. I actually enjoyed
losing to you, Abby.

568
00:33:58,188 --> 00:34:01,472
Thank you. Thank you.
That's much better.

569
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:03,812
Your hands are freezing.
You wanna catch a cab?

570
00:34:03,983 --> 00:34:06,734
No. This is strolling weather
in Minnesota.

571
00:34:06,902 --> 00:34:09,439
- Is that where home is?
- It's where I grew up-

572
00:34:09,612 --> 00:34:10,987
Luka!

573
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:14,313
Give me your purse.
Give me the purse.

574
00:34:14,491 --> 00:34:17,360
- Give me the damn- Give me the purse!
- Take it.

575
00:34:26,499 --> 00:34:29,499
Luka! Luka, stop!

576
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:32,502
Stop! Luka, stop!

577
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,080
Stop it!

578
00:34:53,184 --> 00:34:54,298
Let's play the game!

579
00:34:55,185 --> 00:34:56,976
You okay, Dr. Greene?

580
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:01,095
I thought you said this was
a no-check league.

581
00:35:01,273 --> 00:35:04,522
- There's no such thing.
- Thanks for the tip.

582
00:35:10,321 --> 00:35:13,191
- Hi. I thought you'd left.
- Briefly.

583
00:35:13,865 --> 00:35:16,569
You know, you don't need
to finish your shift.

584
00:35:16,742 --> 00:35:19,279
I still got a couple hours left.

585
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:25,113
Carter, I think that you'd be
better served by taking it easy.

586
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:29,831
I'll go to a meeting after my shift's over.
If that's okay with you?

587
00:35:30,001 --> 00:35:31,709
I need to finish.

588
00:35:31,961 --> 00:35:35,495
All right. But not too much.
Keep it to minor medical.

589
00:35:35,672 --> 00:35:39,620
- Thank you. Have a nice night.
- You too.

590
00:35:40,884 --> 00:35:43,504
- What's open?
- Trauma 2.

591
00:35:45,053 --> 00:35:48,053
- I thought you two went home.
- This guy attacked us.

592
00:35:48,222 --> 00:35:50,677
Blunt head trauma with LOC.
GCS of eight.

593
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:53,518
Three seizures en route.
He's had four of Ativan.

594
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:55,095
- You're bleeding.
- I'm all right.

595
00:35:55,269 --> 00:35:56,348
BP 180/100.

596
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:01,145
I'll take it from here. Luka.
Get someone to take care of him.

597
00:36:01,315 --> 00:36:04,564
- Hey, Carter! I need you in here!
- Dr. Weaver doesn't want-

598
00:36:04,734 --> 00:36:07,734
I don't care. Get in here now.
We've got a major head trauma.

599
00:36:07,903 --> 00:36:11,235
On my count. One, two, three.

600
00:36:12,531 --> 00:36:13,728
He's seizing.

601
00:36:13,907 --> 00:36:16,942
Two of Ativan. CBC, chem panel,
coags, type and cross for four.

602
00:36:17,117 --> 00:36:18,694
Give me suction. He's vomiting.

603
00:36:18,868 --> 00:36:23,161
- Get X-ray in here for a C-spine.
- All right. I'll stabilize the neck.

604
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:26,164
Ativan's on board. Still seizing.

605
00:36:30,335 --> 00:36:31,829
Hey, Carla.

606
00:36:33,045 --> 00:36:35,749
- Peter.
- We need to talk.

607
00:36:35,922 --> 00:36:38,591
- Here, okay? Really busy tonight.
- Sure.

608
00:36:38,757 --> 00:36:41,164
- Here you go. Pick it up.
- Table eight first.

609
00:36:42,218 --> 00:36:45,420
The hospital said Reece could stay
until the end of the month.

610
00:36:45,595 --> 00:36:48,264
That gives us more time
to find another daycare center.

611
00:36:48,431 --> 00:36:50,719
It'll be hard finding him
a place he loves more.

612
00:36:50,891 --> 00:36:55,219
I know. Listen, I just got an Attending
position at Hahnemann in Philadelphia.

613
00:36:55,394 --> 00:36:57,801
Really? Good for you.

614
00:36:57,979 --> 00:37:00,765
So we just need to work out
Reece's visitation schedule.

615
00:37:00,939 --> 00:37:04,105
Maybe he could fly down
every other weekend or something.

616
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:10,652
I'm sorry. You're not suggesting I put
my son on a plane by himself, are you?

617
00:37:10,821 --> 00:37:16,062
- Carla, we have joint custody.
- In Chicago.

618
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:18,444
I already took the job.

619
00:37:18,618 --> 00:37:21,025
Wish that had worked for me
when I wanted to move.

620
00:37:21,203 --> 00:37:24,157
That was Germany, nine hours away.
That's completely different.

621
00:37:24,331 --> 00:37:27,331
- No. It is completely the same.
- What is this about? Payback?

622
00:37:27,499 --> 00:37:32,077
It's about our agreement. Now, either
you stay local, or you give up custody.

623
00:37:32,253 --> 00:37:33,960
I can't find a decent position here.

624
00:37:34,129 --> 00:37:38,078
That's right. You have your career
to think of. The rest of us just have jobs.

625
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:39,502
Table six needs more bread.

626
00:37:39,675 --> 00:37:41,916
This is the only way for me
to keep my momentum.

627
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:45,792
- Yes. And Germany was Roger's.
- Carla, I'm asking you not to do this.

628
00:37:45,971 --> 00:37:50,181
I'm not doing anything.
I'm just playing by your rules.

629
00:38:02,482 --> 00:38:07,273
Hang Dilantin. One gram
per 1000 of saline.

630
00:38:13,198 --> 00:38:16,696
- It looks pretty deep. You need suturing.
- I'm okay.

631
00:38:17,576 --> 00:38:20,659
- Someone should sew it up, Luka.
- I'm okay.

632
00:38:20,828 --> 00:38:22,452
Dr. Kovac?

633
00:38:23,163 --> 00:38:25,832
Detective Stetler.
Can I have a moment?

634
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,702
Can you tell me
exactly what happened?

635
00:38:32,878 --> 00:38:35,285
We were walking by the river.
He jumped us.

636
00:38:35,463 --> 00:38:38,000
- Was there only one assailant?
- Yeah.

637
00:38:39,675 --> 00:38:43,007
- Seizing stopped at 2142.
- Lateral neck looks good.

638
00:38:43,177 --> 00:38:46,011
We need some more Kerlix.
He's soaked through these.

639
00:38:46,179 --> 00:38:48,800
We got a pumper. Curved Kelly.

640
00:38:48,973 --> 00:38:52,506
Pressure's sky-high, 260/140.
Pulse down to 42.

641
00:38:52,684 --> 00:38:55,968
Start the Nipride.
Blown right pupil. He's herniating.

642
00:38:56,144 --> 00:38:59,678
Eighty of mannitol.
Prep for a posterior burr hole.

643
00:38:59,855 --> 00:39:04,681
Hurry up, Carter. I need you to assist.
Perforator drill with a chisel-point bit.

644
00:39:04,859 --> 00:39:06,981
- Damn it, tie that off!
- I'm trying!

645
00:39:07,152 --> 00:39:08,646
Stick a finger on it!

646
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,275
V- tach. No pulse.
Starting chest compressions.

647
00:39:11,447 --> 00:39:13,771
- Charge to 200.
- Carter, can you grab the paddles?

648
00:39:13,948 --> 00:39:16,783
- I'm controlling the bleeder.
- Get a pressure dressing on it.

649
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:20,781
- Give me those four-by-fours. Come on.
- Haleh, I need that drill.

650
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:23,621
- Okay.
- Clear.

651
00:39:25,081 --> 00:39:27,832
I didn't see him coming.

652
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:31,539
After he hit you from behind,
what happened?

653
00:39:31,711 --> 00:39:33,370
I went down.

654
00:39:34,212 --> 00:39:37,082
- Did he take your wallet?
- Yeah.

655
00:39:37,256 --> 00:39:41,502
- And you felt your life was in danger.
- Mine and hers.

656
00:39:42,552 --> 00:39:44,674
Did he threaten to hurt you?

657
00:39:46,096 --> 00:39:47,637
I'm not sure.

658
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:50,503
Did he say, "Give me your money,
or I'll kill you"?

659
00:39:50,682 --> 00:39:52,342
He had a pipe.

660
00:39:53,684 --> 00:39:56,009
He was going after Abby.

661
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:02,517
- And you can corroborate that?
- Yeah.

662
00:40:03,024 --> 00:40:06,688
Let's wait and see what happens.
Seems pretty clear it was self-defense.

663
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,982
Shouldn't be a problem, doc.

664
00:40:24,205 --> 00:40:27,324
There. That's the inner table.
Irrigate the bone dust.

665
00:40:27,499 --> 00:40:30,583
- Looks like a subdural.
- More irrigation, Carter. 11 blade.

666
00:40:30,752 --> 00:40:33,705
- Five minutes since the last epi.
- Give another amp.

667
00:40:33,879 --> 00:40:37,578
Opening the dura.
Get ready to suction.

668
00:40:37,882 --> 00:40:40,586
- Can you see the source?
- No.

669
00:40:41,176 --> 00:40:45,386
Let's just pack it off.
What's the rhythm?

670
00:40:45,554 --> 00:40:47,592
- V-fib.
- Charge to 300.

671
00:40:47,763 --> 00:40:49,222
I need saline gauze.

672
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:51,097
Clear.

673
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,970
- Sinus brady at 50.
- Got a pulse.

674
00:40:56,144 --> 00:40:58,101
Excellent.
Decompress the brain.

675
00:40:58,271 --> 00:41:00,263
Amp of atropine.
Let's check the pupils.

676
00:41:03,691 --> 00:41:07,439
- How about phenobarb?
- Go with pentobarb, 200, slow IV push.

677
00:41:07,611 --> 00:41:11,441
- That'll induce a coma, you know.
- It's either that or watch him die.

678
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,944
Abby told me about what happened.
Can I take a look?

679
00:41:17,117 --> 00:41:18,777
It's superficial.

680
00:41:18,952 --> 00:41:22,201
- Did you lose consciousness?
- For a moment, yeah.

681
00:41:22,371 --> 00:41:24,778
- Come on. Let's fix you up.
- No.

682
00:41:25,123 --> 00:41:28,372
- Do you have a headache?
- Leave me alone!

683
00:41:31,127 --> 00:41:33,534
I'm fine, okay? I'm fine.

684
00:42:32,211 --> 00:42:33,586
Clear.

685
00:42:36,214 --> 00:42:38,170
Still V-fib.

686
00:42:41,259 --> 00:42:44,175
- How long's the bretylium been on board?
- Five minutes.

687
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,428
Clear.

688
00:42:49,598 --> 00:42:53,013
Asystole. What now?

689
00:42:53,267 --> 00:42:57,098
- Open up the dopamine.
- It's been 45 minutes.

690
00:42:57,729 --> 00:42:59,009
I know.

691
00:43:31,544 --> 00:43:33,536
Luka, wait!

692
00:43:37,673 --> 00:43:39,546
Luka, wait.
