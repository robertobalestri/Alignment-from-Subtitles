00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,709
Previously on ER:

2
00:00:05,713 --> 00:00:08,660
Glass of wine and a hot bath
at the end of the day helps.

3
00:00:08,667 --> 00:00:10,281
Hmm, it sounds good to me.

4
00:00:10,293 --> 00:00:11,814
...our water bill 'cause I need to...

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,192
- Do you live with someone?
- We love you.

6
00:00:16,207 --> 00:00:19,562
- I can't do this anymore.
- There's a little girl.

7
00:00:19,567 --> 00:00:22,140
Curtis Ames.
He was a patient of mine.

8
00:00:22,144 --> 00:00:25,177
He followed my wife
and child to the park.

9
00:00:25,214 --> 00:00:27,715
Help me protect my family.

11
00:00:32,684 --> 00:00:36,503
My mom used to put it in a trash bag.
Chicken broth and a can of Crisco.

12
00:00:36,513 --> 00:00:39,376
Yikes. Grill it on the barbecue.
You'll never go back.

13
00:00:39,385 --> 00:00:42,990
I read that brining keeps the juices in.

14
00:00:44,709 --> 00:00:47,203
Hey, did you remember to take
the giblets out of the marinade?

15
00:00:47,218 --> 00:00:49,840
- Take what out of what?
- C-spine is clear.

16
00:00:49,848 --> 00:00:52,112
Well, we should at least
try to pull off the gravy.

17
00:00:52,126 --> 00:00:54,011
All right, sir, I'm gonna take
this collar off.

18
00:00:54,165 --> 00:00:55,841
Let us know if anything hurts, okay?

19
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:58,670
Deep fried turkey
is a religious experience.

20
00:00:58,677 --> 00:01:01,582
- Gross.
- You'd rather cook it in a trash bag?

21
00:01:01,598 --> 00:01:04,950
Americans, so sentimental
about their holidays.

22
00:01:05,046 --> 00:01:08,192
This from the guy that celebrates
Croatian Independence,

23
00:01:08,207 --> 00:01:11,452
Croatian State Day and something
called Patriotic Gratitude Day.

24
00:01:12,216 --> 00:01:14,313
- Oh, no.
- What?

25
00:01:16,148 --> 00:01:19,192
I have ten minutes left in my shift
and the transport pager goes off.

26
00:01:19,206 --> 00:01:21,431
- I'll go.
- No, you can't. You're an intern.

27
00:01:21,516 --> 00:01:23,941
Maybe the dispatcher just wants
to say "Happy Thanksgiving."

28
00:01:23,957 --> 00:01:26,513
Yeah, right, I'm sure that's what it is.

29
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:30,270
- Jane? Jane!
- Abby.

30
00:01:30,288 --> 00:01:32,141
You're supposed to carry the transport
pager overnight, right?

31
00:01:32,146 --> 00:01:33,720
- Uh, yeah.
- Well, it just went off,

32
00:01:33,786 --> 00:01:36,501
and I was thinking maybe
you could just take it?

33
00:01:36,867 --> 00:01:39,171
- Mmm... no.
- No?

34
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:40,782
Come on.
Why not?

35
00:01:40,797 --> 00:01:42,783
Five more minutes,
it would've been your call anyway.

36
00:01:42,908 --> 00:01:44,991
Sorry, Abby, it just doesn't
really work that way.

37
00:01:45,006 --> 00:01:46,142
What way?

38
00:01:46,158 --> 00:01:48,853
Well, if the pager goes off during
your shift, then you have to go.

39
00:01:48,868 --> 00:01:50,980
Yeah, but I just want to spend
Thanksgiving with my kid.

40
00:01:50,997 --> 00:01:52,643
You know, it's like that story with the guy

41
00:01:52,656 --> 00:01:54,852
who's hunting dinosaurs and he strays off the path

42
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:57,860
and steps on a butterfly and then
everything in the future's ever so

43
00:01:57,866 --> 00:01:59,243
- slightly different.
- What?

44
00:01:59,258 --> 00:02:02,101
It's bad karma to mess
with the universal order of things.

45
00:02:02,118 --> 00:02:04,250
Erase unicycle man.
He can go.

46
00:02:04,405 --> 00:02:05,673
- Ray.
- Yeah?

47
00:02:05,686 --> 00:02:07,753
- Take this run, I'll owe you big time.
- Ooh, I'd love to.

48
00:02:07,766 --> 00:02:09,032
- Great.
- I can't.

49
00:02:09,048 --> 00:02:11,880
Pratt thinks I'm losing too much ER time.
He banned me from transports.

50
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,893
Well, I just like having you near me, Ray.

51
00:02:14,098 --> 00:02:16,363
Surprise, surprise-- you all get me
instead of Morris tonight.

52
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:19,090
He begged me to switch so
he could spend time with his kids.

53
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:20,992
That's why I'm here.
What's your excuse?

54
00:02:21,037 --> 00:02:24,440
Henry went to Orlando with his grandparents.
I figured I might as well come in.

55
00:02:24,455 --> 00:02:26,842
Oh. I love working on Thanksgiving.
Everybody's at home

56
00:02:26,858 --> 00:02:29,241
eating and watching football,
even the freaks.

57
00:02:29,257 --> 00:02:32,812
Ah, the great American tradition
of sanctioned gluttony. No, thanks.

58
00:02:32,835 --> 00:02:34,202
I'm not trying to block the run,

59
00:02:34,216 --> 00:02:38,410
I'm just asking does a garden variety
MI really need a doc on board?

60
00:02:38,648 --> 00:02:42,722
Miss Lulu Davis, age 12, vomiting
and abdominal pain times two hours.

61
00:02:42,738 --> 00:02:44,983
- Hi, I'm Dr. Figler.
- Hey, Lulu.

62
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,101
We'll take care of you.
I got this.

63
00:02:46,115 --> 00:02:48,101
- Oh, I got here first.
- Yeah, but I'm good with kids.

64
00:02:48,118 --> 00:02:50,662
- Are you saying that I'm not?
- No, hold on. Wait a minute.

65
00:02:50,675 --> 00:02:52,653
H-H-Hold on a second.
Lulu, are you okay?

66
00:02:56,186 --> 00:02:57,202
Oops.

67
00:02:57,495 --> 00:02:58,711
Cranberries.

68
00:02:58,726 --> 00:03:01,063
Sorry, Jane.
Karma sucks.

69
00:03:10,225 --> 00:03:13,452
Three hours at 450.

70
00:03:13,466 --> 00:03:15,452
- And don't forget to baste.
- How often?

71
00:03:16,006 --> 00:03:18,702
I don't know.
30 minutes?

72
00:03:19,247 --> 00:03:21,341
I don't know. I'll probably be home
in time to mash the potatoes.

73
00:03:21,348 --> 00:03:25,483
- Okay, what do I do with the pumpkin?
- Oh... I forgot about the pie.

74
00:03:25,498 --> 00:03:28,910
- Dr. Kovac, you got a minute?
- Uh, yeah, just a second.

75
00:03:28,926 --> 00:03:31,013
I thought pumpkins
were only for Halloween.

76
00:03:31,025 --> 00:03:33,390
You know what, screw the pie.
I never really liked pumpkins anyway.

77
00:03:33,808 --> 00:03:35,953
Are you sure you just don't want
to order Chinese?

78
00:03:36,536 --> 00:03:38,702
But baste, remember to baste!

79
00:03:40,337 --> 00:03:42,600
I went to see your guy,
Curtis Ames, yesterday.

80
00:03:42,616 --> 00:03:44,601
He didn't know anything
about any kid's toy.

81
00:03:44,615 --> 00:03:46,663
Did he admit to following
them to the park?

82
00:03:46,676 --> 00:03:48,820
He didn't know
what I was talking about.

83
00:03:49,005 --> 00:03:50,821
Look, the guy's had a pretty
tough time at things.

84
00:03:50,835 --> 00:03:52,110
You know, he's barely getting by.

85
00:03:52,128 --> 00:03:55,750
Okay, I realize that, but that's no excuse
for messing with my family.

86
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,953
If you want my opinion,

87
00:03:56,966 --> 00:04:00,691
he's too busy trying to feed and clothe
himself to mess with anyone, Doc.

88
00:04:02,007 --> 00:04:03,312
Right.

89
00:04:07,837 --> 00:04:09,363
- You get airsick?
- No.

90
00:04:09,377 --> 00:04:10,591
Claustrophobic?

91
00:04:10,665 --> 00:04:12,982
Maybe you should just
tell me about the patient.

92
00:04:13,645 --> 00:04:16,311
88-year-old female, anterior MI.

93
00:04:16,336 --> 00:04:18,330
I can't tell you how many docs
think they can handle this,

94
00:04:18,338 --> 00:04:20,373
- then freak out at altitude.
- I work in an ER.

95
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:23,400
- It's pretty hard to freak me out.
- You do okay with heights, honey?

96
00:04:23,415 --> 00:04:24,663
Loud noises?

97
00:04:24,676 --> 00:04:27,952
Yeah, but mice make me jump
on a chair and say, "Eek."

98
00:04:29,746 --> 00:04:32,491
Danny!
Meet Dr. Lockhart!

99
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:34,192
- Hi!
- Sit!

100
00:04:34,978 --> 00:04:36,473
Don't stand.

101
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:39,362
Don't disembark till we tell you to.

102
00:04:39,726 --> 00:04:42,911
Keep your headset and
your seatbelt on at all times.

103
00:04:43,006 --> 00:04:44,743
If you need to speak to us,

104
00:04:44,755 --> 00:04:47,923
slide this switch this way
to activate the intercom.

105
00:04:47,938 --> 00:04:51,422
Do not press that button.
That transmits over the radio.

106
00:04:55,308 --> 00:04:57,103
This baby is tight.

107
00:04:59,895 --> 00:05:01,002
Excuse me?

108
00:05:01,015 --> 00:05:03,680
First night out after
two months of upgrades.

109
00:05:03,998 --> 00:05:07,100
Satellite phone, GPS, new hoist.

110
00:05:07,437 --> 00:05:09,272
All the cool toys.

111
00:05:09,756 --> 00:05:11,531
I'm Jasper.
This is Evan.

112
00:05:11,538 --> 00:05:12,493
Hey.

113
00:05:13,097 --> 00:05:14,823
What'd you say your name was?

114
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:18,263
- Abby.
- Abby.

115
00:05:18,778 --> 00:05:21,612
# Come fly with me #

116
00:05:21,735 --> 00:05:25,032
# Let's float down to Peru #

117
00:05:25,507 --> 00:05:28,830
# In llama land #
# There's a one-man band #

118
00:05:28,847 --> 00:05:32,813
# And he'll toot
his flute for you #

119
00:05:32,905 --> 00:05:36,953
# Come fly with me, Abby #

120
00:05:37,566 --> 00:05:40,942
# Let's take off
In the blue #

121
00:06:04,886 --> 00:06:07,180
Does it hurt when I press
or when I let go?

122
00:06:07,195 --> 00:06:08,551
About the same.

123
00:06:08,998 --> 00:06:11,932
- I'm thirsty.
- Too bad. You're NPO.

124
00:06:11,947 --> 00:06:14,312
- What's that?
- "Nil per os."  Nothing by mouth.

125
00:06:14,317 --> 00:06:17,201
Food or liquids may exacerbate
or complicate an obstruction,

126
00:06:17,237 --> 00:06:20,653
volvulus or inflammation.
Not to mention increased aspiration risk

127
00:06:20,668 --> 00:06:23,232
during intubation should you
be going to the OR tonight.

128
00:06:23,598 --> 00:06:26,390
Um... I'm sorry I threw up on you.

129
00:06:26,408 --> 00:06:30,902
Oh, I don't mind the fact that I had to take
a shower to get the chunks out of my hair.

130
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:34,773
I just honestly don't know how I'm gonna
survive a whole shift dressed like this.

131
00:06:34,776 --> 00:06:38,100
Hey, Lulu, I'm gonna order up a few tests
to see what's going on in there, okay?

132
00:06:38,178 --> 00:06:41,473
I mean, bunnies, puppy dogs--
I'm like breaking out in hives.

133
00:06:41,478 --> 00:06:43,573
Jane, why don't you let me
take it from here.

134
00:06:44,268 --> 00:06:46,903
- Your parents are on their way, right?
- Uh, yeah, definitely.

135
00:06:46,928 --> 00:06:50,961
I think it's hip. I think it's fetishy.
I think you totally pull it off.

136
00:06:50,976 --> 00:06:52,351
Shut up, Gates.

137
00:06:52,367 --> 00:06:55,242
Hey, Sam, I need a CBC
on the little girl in two.

138
00:06:55,256 --> 00:06:59,192
And order up an extra red top if you can
just in case the blood bank needs it.

139
00:06:59,207 --> 00:07:00,790
- Got it.
- Hey, Alex.

140
00:07:01,086 --> 00:07:04,752
Don't ya have anything better to do than hangout
with a bunch of losers like us on Thanksgiving?

141
00:07:05,107 --> 00:07:08,313
If he stayed at home,
he'd play video games all night, so

142
00:07:08,325 --> 00:07:10,942
I figured I'd bring him in here and
make him do a little community service.

143
00:07:10,956 --> 00:07:12,620
That's cool, man.

144
00:07:12,634 --> 00:07:15,373
Yeah, handing out cookies to sick people.
That's really cool.

145
00:07:15,373 --> 00:07:17,846
Hey, it could be worse.
You could be one of those sick people.

146
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:19,910
Four pages in the last 20 minutes?

147
00:07:19,929 --> 00:07:22,183
- What's the crisis, Dr. Gates?
- Oh, no crisis.

148
00:07:22,205 --> 00:07:27,353
It's just an incarcerated hernia, a gluteal
abscess, road rash that needs skin grafting,

149
00:07:27,368 --> 00:07:30,721
an imbedded drill bit,
rule-out appy on a 12-year-old girl.

150
00:07:30,736 --> 00:07:32,630
- You're making this up.
- I wish I were.

151
00:07:32,645 --> 00:07:34,670
You're sure it's not just an excuse
to keep me down here?

152
00:07:34,685 --> 00:07:38,081
Oh, please, I would never dream
of wasting your time like that.

153
00:07:38,467 --> 00:07:39,550
But really...

154
00:07:39,778 --> 00:07:42,270
must you look so hot all the time?

155
00:07:42,277 --> 00:07:45,641
I mean, even in that ridiculous hat,
I can't concentrate.

156
00:07:45,657 --> 00:07:47,061
- I can't even talk.
- You know,

157
00:07:47,207 --> 00:07:49,653
enough of this harassment.
I have work to do.

158
00:07:53,026 --> 00:07:55,202
Are you the team from County?
Yeah. Watch it. Watch it.

159
00:07:55,277 --> 00:07:56,840
Hi, I'm Dr. Lockhart.

160
00:07:56,928 --> 00:08:01,472
Mom was fine, cooked a 20-pound turkey.
She carved it and then she just collapsed.

161
00:08:01,487 --> 00:08:04,460
- We thought she was kidding around.
- But then we couldn't wake her up.

162
00:08:04,475 --> 00:08:06,452
- That must've been scary.
- Get the history later.

163
00:08:06,467 --> 00:08:08,952
- You guys stay out here.
- We need to examine your mother.

164
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:12,020
Excuse me, I'm looking for a patient,
Elizabeth Timmons.

165
00:08:12,036 --> 00:08:13,741
Thank heavens.
This way.

166
00:08:17,337 --> 00:08:19,283
You didn't say anything
about her being intubated.

167
00:08:19,297 --> 00:08:21,750
- They never tell the whole story.
- Vitals?

168
00:08:21,825 --> 00:08:25,311
- Tachy to 124, sat 92.
- You got a BP?

169
00:08:25,316 --> 00:08:28,273
Last one was 74/38 on dopa.

170
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,832
- Great. What about an EKG?
- Right here.

171
00:08:30,848 --> 00:08:32,880
- Dr. Russo, thanks for coming.
- Abby Lockhart.

172
00:08:32,898 --> 00:08:34,793
This place gets really backed up
when we have a patient like this.

173
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:37,172
- Sat's 82.
- She's tombstoning.

174
00:08:37,287 --> 00:08:39,460
- What about thrombolytics?
- Already gave it, no response.

175
00:08:39,476 --> 00:08:40,591
Okay, okay.

176
00:08:40,607 --> 00:08:42,480
I'm sorry.
Can we have a reality check here?

177
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:45,162
Does this family know how sick she is?
They know she's having a heart attack.

178
00:08:45,176 --> 00:08:47,771
Do they know that she's not breathing
and her blood pressure sucks

179
00:08:47,787 --> 00:08:50,223
and she's probably not perfusing
her brain enough?

180
00:08:50,318 --> 00:08:51,892
I mean, we can't move her.

181
00:08:51,908 --> 00:08:54,073
- She's unstable.
- The family wants her out of here.

182
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:56,333
- She won't make the trip.
- You don't know that.

183
00:08:56,775 --> 00:09:01,091
If she survives the helicopter, she will probably
die before the family makes it to County.

184
00:09:01,105 --> 00:09:02,721
- What's your point?
- Well...

185
00:09:04,797 --> 00:09:07,552
she's 88 years old.
She's not coming back from this.

186
00:09:07,927 --> 00:09:10,453
Don't you think dying here
with her loved ones

187
00:09:10,465 --> 00:09:12,802
is better than dying alone
in the ICU at County?

188
00:09:12,835 --> 00:09:15,451
Listen, Doctor.
Our job is to scoop and run.

189
00:09:15,476 --> 00:09:18,910
The longer we stay and jaw about it, the
more unstable this little lady's gonna get.

190
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,873
All right, you know what,
just give me five minutes.

191
00:09:20,887 --> 00:09:22,732
I'm gonna make sure they understand.

192
00:09:24,687 --> 00:09:27,930
52 years, rain or shine.

193
00:09:27,966 --> 00:09:33,973
He drives me around the lake
on a tandem bike after Thanksgiving.

194
00:09:34,025 --> 00:09:36,340
Ah, isn't that sweet.
You're blind, Mr. Hunter.

195
00:09:36,358 --> 00:09:37,713
Maybe you should let her drive.

196
00:09:37,738 --> 00:09:40,542
Oh, that wouldn't work at all.
I can't carry a tune.

197
00:09:40,555 --> 00:09:43,233
He drives, I sing.
It's tradition.

198
00:09:43,248 --> 00:09:45,773
Send him to radiology and call me
hen the films get back.

199
00:09:45,806 --> 00:09:47,871
Ray, help.
I need an order for sumatriptan.

200
00:09:47,885 --> 00:09:50,302
- Migraines?
- I get one every Thanksgiving.

201
00:09:50,317 --> 00:09:53,033
- It's the stuffing.
- Okay, 20 milligrams intranasally.

202
00:09:53,045 --> 00:09:54,831
Then why do you eat it?

203
00:09:54,846 --> 00:09:59,123
Because it's amazing.
Mom makes it with bacon and almonds.

204
00:09:59,178 --> 00:10:02,852
Lands me in the hospital every
Thanksgiving. Hmm, but it's worth it.

205
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:05,213
I'll be right back with your medicine.

206
00:10:07,026 --> 00:10:10,212
Holidays weird me out.
The special foods, the little rituals.

207
00:10:10,226 --> 00:10:11,881
- It's not my thing.
- Yeah,

208
00:10:11,897 --> 00:10:15,500
when I was a kid, Thanksgiving was just an
excuse to stay home all day and watch TV.

209
00:10:15,517 --> 00:10:18,682
I always figured when I grew up
and had kids of my own,

210
00:10:18,695 --> 00:10:23,210
I'd do the whole family thing,
a big banquet, but you know,

211
00:10:23,226 --> 00:10:26,281
here we are, just me and Alex,
hanging out in the hospital.

212
00:10:27,496 --> 00:10:30,171
Didn't your parents demand you
come home for the holiday?

213
00:10:30,185 --> 00:10:32,360
Nah, my mom's in Trinidad
with her new boyfriend

214
00:10:32,367 --> 00:10:35,900
and my dad's never even heard
of a home-cooked meal, so...

215
00:10:36,206 --> 00:10:37,453
Ah, well.

216
00:10:37,466 --> 00:10:40,122
At least you got something hot
waiting for you at home.

217
00:10:41,186 --> 00:10:42,301
What?

218
00:10:43,516 --> 00:10:45,582
Missing your cell phone perhaps?

219
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,661
What?

220
00:10:48,077 --> 00:10:50,611
Yeah, how did you...

221
00:10:51,035 --> 00:10:54,191
Hematology needed you,
so we called your cell phone

222
00:10:54,205 --> 00:10:56,631
and you will never guess who answered.

223
00:10:58,528 --> 00:11:01,070
Surgical med student Katey Alvaro.

224
00:11:01,758 --> 00:11:05,203
- Oh, well, we were studying.
- Right.

225
00:11:05,227 --> 00:11:08,622
I mean, well, she couldn't talk
'cause she was baking you something.

226
00:11:08,727 --> 00:11:09,992
A little treat.

227
00:11:12,736 --> 00:11:14,681
Any chance you could
be wrong about this?

228
00:11:14,697 --> 00:11:16,381
Well, y-yes, but I just--

229
00:11:16,398 --> 00:11:17,942
- based on my experience...
- Well, which is it?

230
00:11:18,168 --> 00:11:20,040
First, you tell us that
he won't survive the trip

231
00:11:20,056 --> 00:11:21,620
and now you say
that you might be wrong.

232
00:11:21,635 --> 00:11:23,362
I know this is hard.
I'm sorry.

233
00:11:23,376 --> 00:11:25,343
- I just think it's important that you take...
- Time's up. Let's go.

234
00:11:25,345 --> 00:11:28,103
- All right, just wait.
- Find the clerk, sign the consent.

235
00:11:28,116 --> 00:11:30,942
- We'll be at County in 45 minutes.
- But she just said that we should think...

236
00:11:30,955 --> 00:11:32,653
It's your mom's only chance.

237
00:11:33,076 --> 00:11:36,341
Okay. Uh, take her.

238
00:11:36,776 --> 00:11:37,831
Come on.

239
00:11:42,858 --> 00:11:44,310
She is going to die.

240
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:47,371
Yeah, and I'm doing my best
to facilitate a good death for her.

241
00:11:47,385 --> 00:11:49,270
- That's not your job.
- Not your call.

242
00:11:49,288 --> 00:11:51,750
Here's how it works.
The referring hospital refers

243
00:11:51,767 --> 00:11:54,570
and the accepting hospital accepts
and we're just the deliverymen.

244
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:57,301
- Sorry, delivery people.
- You're denying the responsibility

245
00:11:57,317 --> 00:12:00,393
- that comes with your job.
- I'm not the one who's in denial here.

246
00:12:00,407 --> 00:12:02,362
Good death?
No such thing, babe.

247
00:12:02,377 --> 00:12:04,782
If you think you can make this
a good experience for that family,

248
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,961
you're even more arrogant than I thought.

249
00:12:07,117 --> 00:12:11,763
Mom, if you can hear me,
we'll see you in Chicago. Okay?

250
00:12:11,778 --> 00:12:14,221
Hey, in a few weeks,
you're gonna be a great-grandmother.

251
00:12:14,236 --> 00:12:15,960
Everyone stay back.

252
00:12:16,577 --> 00:12:18,791
God bless you, Dr. Lockhart.

253
00:12:23,387 --> 00:12:25,153
Systolic's holding above 80.

254
00:12:25,168 --> 00:12:28,772
- Yeah, on 20 mikes of dopamine.
- Still counts.

255
00:12:31,998 --> 00:12:35,522
All right, you know,
maybe you were right,

256
00:12:35,537 --> 00:12:37,511
- maybe...
- D-Don't say it. Don't say it.

257
00:12:37,525 --> 00:12:40,133
Nothing more painful than
listening to a lady eat crow.

258
00:12:40,146 --> 00:12:43,873
- I'm not eating crow.
- Which reminds me, I am starving.

259
00:12:44,858 --> 00:12:47,473
- Good idea.
- Turkey, cranberry sauce.

260
00:12:47,486 --> 00:12:51,132
- Wife even baked the bread.
- We got a patient here. She's fine.

261
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:53,131
You know, I feel sorry for your old man.

262
00:12:53,518 --> 00:12:55,451
What's that supposed to mean?

263
00:13:02,967 --> 00:13:05,632
- It's just the turbulence.
- I don't think so.

264
00:13:05,676 --> 00:13:07,650
Charge the defibrillator now.

265
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:11,422
Febrile to 101, vomiting
and mild rebound.

266
00:13:11,456 --> 00:13:13,403
How long has this been going on, sweetie?

267
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,250
It started during the salad.

268
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:18,723
Salad for Thanksgiving?
Your family's weird.

269
00:13:19,316 --> 00:13:21,470
- Tell me about it.
- White count?

270
00:13:22,146 --> 00:13:23,503
Pending.

271
00:13:25,366 --> 00:13:27,202
Are those chocolate chip?

272
00:13:28,367 --> 00:13:29,662
Uh, no.

273
00:13:29,678 --> 00:13:32,753
- Could I have one anyway?
- Um, yeah, sure.

274
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:38,430
You know, this holiday is a lie.

275
00:13:38,946 --> 00:13:40,000
Really?

276
00:13:40,016 --> 00:13:43,281
Yeah, the only thing the pilgrims
shared with the Indians were measles.

277
00:13:44,105 --> 00:13:46,401
- Okay.
- I'm Lulu.

278
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,672
- Thanks for the cookie.
- Yeah.

279
00:13:49,255 --> 00:13:51,720
Hey, you can't eat that, honey; you're NPO.

280
00:13:51,918 --> 00:13:54,000
Oh, yeah, nil per os.

281
00:13:54,207 --> 00:13:56,210
It's Thanksgiving and I can't even eat.

282
00:13:56,238 --> 00:14:00,473
Alex, what did I tell you about asking the doctors
or nurses before giving away the cookies?

283
00:14:01,978 --> 00:14:03,201
Labs are back.

284
00:14:04,187 --> 00:14:07,353
Her white count's 14.
Let's get a CT. I'll call the scanner.

285
00:14:07,365 --> 00:14:10,023
All right, you know, we talked to
your mom on the phone earlier

286
00:14:10,036 --> 00:14:14,160
and she gave us permission to give you
a very special X ray on your tummy.

287
00:14:14,606 --> 00:14:16,372
She didn't want to talk to me?

288
00:14:17,785 --> 00:14:20,992
No, but she said to make sure
we treat you like a VIP.

289
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:24,942
- I'm sure she'll be here soon.
- That's okay.

290
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,760
Alex can wait with me.

291
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:28,433
Right, Alex?

292
00:14:29,197 --> 00:14:30,571
Yeah.

293
00:14:34,275 --> 00:14:35,581
Clear!

294
00:14:36,697 --> 00:14:38,602
- Still v-fib.
- Damn it.

295
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:41,651
- She's 88 years old.
- Yeah, I tried to make that point an hour ago.

296
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:43,521
- We're committed now.
- Lido's in.

297
00:14:43,535 --> 00:14:44,833
All right, another mig of epi.

298
00:14:44,847 --> 00:14:47,572
- She's had five rounds of meds.
- Yeah, well, let's make it six.

299
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,172
We never should have brought her up here.

300
00:14:50,186 --> 00:14:53,911
- Darling, it's the job.
- Oh, spare me the platitudes, okay?

301
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:55,730
Go again. Go !

302
00:14:56,947 --> 00:14:57,891
Clear!

303
00:15:00,235 --> 00:15:01,623
Nothing.

304
00:15:36,877 --> 00:15:39,481
If the scar shows above my bikini,
I'm suing both your asses.

305
00:15:39,488 --> 00:15:41,452
Need some help here!
Ladies, we're in a hospital now.

306
00:15:41,465 --> 00:15:43,860
- Time to grow up.
- Don't tell me what to do, Grandma.

307
00:15:43,877 --> 00:15:46,182
- Grandma?
- You bobble-headed little bitch!

308
00:15:46,577 --> 00:15:48,522
Okay, let's settle down.
All right, what happened?

309
00:15:48,537 --> 00:15:50,602
- She pushed me into the display.
- I fell, she fell.

310
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,463
These three were fighting over a bag
at Bovards' midnight sale.

311
00:15:53,478 --> 00:15:55,952
- All right, come on. Let's go.
- Midnight sale? It's not even 8:00 yet.

312
00:15:55,975 --> 00:15:58,402
The name's just tradition.
It starts at 4:00 in the afternoon now.

313
00:15:58,406 --> 00:16:00,213
Bendi Brioche 80% off.

314
00:16:00,238 --> 00:16:03,072
- Normally $1,800.
- They only did a limited run.

315
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,883
Somehow during the scuffle,
Mandy fell into the nativity display.

316
00:16:05,897 --> 00:16:08,793
- I was pushed.
- Nativity display? It's Thanksgiving.

317
00:16:08,857 --> 00:16:11,102
Yeah, well, that's when
the Christmas decorations go up.

318
00:16:11,126 --> 00:16:13,681
Impaled by a fiberglass
Star of Bethlehem.

319
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:14,911
Jane, call surgery.

320
00:16:14,947 --> 00:16:17,710
With all that's happened,
I can't keep this now.

321
00:16:18,056 --> 00:16:19,983
Oh, that's so sweet, honey.

322
00:16:20,586 --> 00:16:23,110
Give it back, evil grandma whore.

323
00:16:23,906 --> 00:16:27,022
Wow, this is really sad.

324
00:16:29,567 --> 00:16:31,932
- Hello.
- Hi.

325
00:16:32,608 --> 00:16:35,392
I was just calling to say it's still probably going to be a while.

326
00:16:35,406 --> 00:16:36,922
Are you okay?

327
00:16:37,735 --> 00:16:38,942
Abby?

328
00:16:40,858 --> 00:16:43,221
Abby? You there?

329
00:16:43,307 --> 00:16:46,531
Don't worry.
We're taking good care of your girl.

330
00:16:47,276 --> 00:16:48,932
Are you listening?

331
00:16:49,177 --> 00:16:50,470
Who's that?

332
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:52,992
You guys are assholes.

333
00:16:53,005 --> 00:16:55,992
- Abby?
- Luka, I'll call you when we land.

334
00:16:56,618 --> 00:16:57,881
Hang up the phone.

335
00:16:57,907 --> 00:17:00,173
- You didn't say good-bye.
- Hang up the phone!

336
00:17:00,558 --> 00:17:01,932
Sorry about that.

337
00:17:01,977 --> 00:17:05,750
- I accidentally mixed up my channels.
- What, are we in fifth grade here?

338
00:17:05,785 --> 00:17:09,492
- Airmedic 6, dispatch.
- Airmedic 6.

339
00:17:09,508 --> 00:17:14,393
Airmedic 6, we have a report of a vehicle
over the side of Highway 16 at Neosha Ravine.

340
00:17:14,407 --> 00:17:15,812
Are you available?

341
00:17:19,395 --> 00:17:23,232
- Why aren't you answering her?
- We're about to time out.

342
00:17:23,246 --> 00:17:25,912
Pilots are only allowed to fly
for a max of 12 hours.

343
00:17:25,928 --> 00:17:27,793
I've been up for almost 11.

344
00:17:28,888 --> 00:17:30,292
Airmedic 6?

345
00:17:33,275 --> 00:17:35,222
So you're just going to ignore her?

346
00:17:35,238 --> 00:17:37,553
Don't worry.
Another unit will get it.

347
00:17:37,565 --> 00:17:40,451
Yeah, but we're not far from Neosha.

348
00:17:42,738 --> 00:17:44,523
Tell her where we are.

349
00:17:45,385 --> 00:17:47,270
You don't have to look
to Daddy for permission.

350
00:17:47,288 --> 00:17:50,241
Just do your job and
tell her where we are.

351
00:17:50,835 --> 00:17:54,373
Dispatch, Airmedic 6.
We're at Highway 12 and county line.

352
00:17:54,387 --> 00:17:57,990
- Are we the closest unit?
- Airmedic 6, that's affirmative.

353
00:17:58,206 --> 00:17:59,821
Then put us on the call.

354
00:17:59,838 --> 00:18:02,010
Airmedic 6,
you're assigned to the incident.

355
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:03,532
Who is this?

356
00:18:04,045 --> 00:18:08,993
Abby Lockhart. I'm the doctor
on board and we're responding.

357
00:18:10,877 --> 00:18:13,131
Darling, it's the job.

358
00:18:19,036 --> 00:18:22,333
No free air, no fluid.
Looks like the star missed the peritoneum.

359
00:18:22,378 --> 00:18:25,602
The Thanksgiving sales, the parades,
the blockbuster movies.

360
00:18:25,616 --> 00:18:29,653
Those are all just to prime you for the bald-
faced commercialism of the holiday season.

361
00:18:29,836 --> 00:18:31,202
Syringe.

362
00:18:32,518 --> 00:18:34,170
Lidocaine, 1%.

363
00:18:34,198 --> 00:18:36,482
- Your wounds are superficial.
- You got lucky.

364
00:18:36,498 --> 00:18:37,802
Yeah, right.

365
00:18:37,815 --> 00:18:41,573
By the time I get back to the sale, all they'll
have left are bad colors and big sizes.

366
00:18:41,586 --> 00:18:44,201
You were impaled while fighting
over an overpriced vessel

367
00:18:44,215 --> 00:18:48,272
for credit cards and lipstick.
Doesn't that sorta kinda feel like a sign?

368
00:18:48,305 --> 00:18:49,530
Wake up.

369
00:18:52,615 --> 00:18:55,903
A gram of Ancef, 3-0 silk
and irrigation tray.

370
00:18:57,867 --> 00:19:00,432
Jane, uh, stay and assist the doctor.

371
00:19:06,207 --> 00:19:08,091
We should be close!

372
00:19:23,178 --> 00:19:25,450
She said "vehicle," not "bus."

373
00:19:25,878 --> 00:19:27,192
Cheap trick.

374
00:19:27,218 --> 00:19:29,711
How are we supposed to get down there?

375
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:41,931
If you're taking that long to find
a pulse, it's not worth looking.

376
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:44,703
Don't waste time with resuscitations.

377
00:20:44,836 --> 00:20:48,311
- Help the people you can help.
- I know how to triage. Thank you.

378
00:20:48,325 --> 00:20:50,401
That bus is unstable.

379
00:20:50,605 --> 00:20:54,013
Keep triaging
until the cavalry gets here.

380
00:20:55,175 --> 00:20:57,122
Help-- my arm!

381
00:20:57,136 --> 00:21:00,730
It won't stop.
I'm telling you, it won't stop.

382
00:21:00,755 --> 00:21:03,423
Okay, okay, okay, let me see.
Let me see.

383
00:21:04,826 --> 00:21:06,752
Just sit down.
Sit down.

384
00:21:06,778 --> 00:21:09,583
Keep pressure on this
and keep your arm up, okay?

385
00:21:09,607 --> 00:21:12,470
We're all gonna freeze
to death out here!

386
00:21:12,486 --> 00:21:14,473
We're gonna get you out
of the cold soon, okay?

387
00:21:14,485 --> 00:21:18,402
How?!
Help! Please! Somebody!

388
00:21:20,067 --> 00:21:22,930
- Over here!
- Stay like that.

389
00:21:22,955 --> 00:21:24,772
- Stay like...
- Wait! Wait!

390
00:21:25,078 --> 00:21:27,643
- I don't know what to do!
- Are more people coming?

391
00:21:28,028 --> 00:21:31,511
- What's the plan? Do you have a plan?
- His foot is pointing the wrong way.

392
00:21:33,555 --> 00:21:35,433
Can you tell me what your name is?

393
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:37,822
- It's Matt.
- Hi, Matt.

394
00:21:38,236 --> 00:21:41,101
- I'm Abby. I'm a doctor.
- Hey, doc.

395
00:21:41,115 --> 00:21:42,902
No, no, no, no, don't move.
Don't move.

396
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:46,142
Can you hold his head like this?
Make sure he doesn't move his neck.

397
00:21:46,155 --> 00:21:49,412
I can't feel my leg!
Oh, God.

398
00:21:50,186 --> 00:21:52,470
- Can you move your feet at all?
- No!

399
00:21:52,837 --> 00:21:54,502
- Baby, no!
- It's all right.

400
00:21:54,505 --> 00:21:57,353
I'm gonna go find something
to splint your leg with, okay?

401
00:21:57,595 --> 00:22:02,133
Help! Somebody...
Somebody help!

402
00:22:02,148 --> 00:22:04,343
Please! Help!

403
00:22:04,998 --> 00:22:09,373
Mom, don't close your eyes.
Stay awake, somebody's coming.

404
00:22:09,387 --> 00:22:13,013
- Mom? Mom!
- All right, don't move.

405
00:22:13,027 --> 00:22:17,030
- I'm gonna come back there.
- Mom, she's here now! It's gonna be okay!

406
00:22:21,195 --> 00:22:22,390
Hello?!

407
00:22:24,225 --> 00:22:27,240
- Are you hurt, too?
- No, it's just my mom. Please.

408
00:22:27,255 --> 00:22:29,262
- Hang on.
- You got to get her out.

409
00:22:30,525 --> 00:22:32,762
Mom, it's okay.

410
00:22:33,828 --> 00:22:35,761
Please get her out.

411
00:22:37,735 --> 00:22:39,262
I'm Abby.

412
00:22:39,535 --> 00:22:41,023
I'm a doctor.

413
00:22:42,668 --> 00:22:45,082
- Can you tell me your name?
- Melanie.

414
00:22:49,665 --> 00:22:52,902
- Melanie, can you move at all?
- She's stuck!

415
00:23:06,825 --> 00:23:09,803
Okay. We're gonna get you out
of here, all right?

416
00:23:10,175 --> 00:23:12,362
- Come on. Let's go!
- Are you ready?

417
00:23:12,555 --> 00:23:16,002
One, two, three.

418
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,593
Is... Is that all my blood?

419
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,613
I don't know.

420
00:23:28,937 --> 00:23:30,951
I don't know where
that blood's coming from.

421
00:23:31,735 --> 00:23:33,573
Come on. Fix her!

422
00:23:41,876 --> 00:23:43,413
I can't.

423
00:23:44,388 --> 00:23:47,762
I can't move you now.

424
00:23:48,288 --> 00:23:51,703
- I understand.
- Okay.

425
00:23:53,547 --> 00:23:56,543
- You should take Milo out.
- No! I won't go!

426
00:23:56,555 --> 00:23:59,530
- Baby, go with the doctor.
- No!

427
00:23:59,828 --> 00:24:02,823
Milo, there are people coming with
special equipment. They're gonna help us.

428
00:24:02,838 --> 00:24:05,993
- And I'll wait here with her!
- Milo, I love you.

429
00:24:06,265 --> 00:24:11,403
- This is gonna help you with the pain.
- I need you to be a brave boy now, okay?

430
00:24:14,257 --> 00:24:17,621
- Please, just get him off this bus!
- No!

431
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:20,613
- Go with the doctor, baby.
- No.

432
00:24:21,048 --> 00:24:23,393
- Milo...
- You can be a good helper.

433
00:24:23,405 --> 00:24:25,620
- No!
- Go ahead.

434
00:24:25,637 --> 00:24:27,030
Milo, come on.

435
00:24:29,005 --> 00:24:31,140
Please, just make sure he's okay.

436
00:24:31,656 --> 00:24:33,253
Let's go, now. Come on.

437
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,833
- No!
- Let's go. Watch your head.

438
00:24:49,027 --> 00:24:50,920
See, I told you it wouldn't hurt.

439
00:24:54,567 --> 00:24:57,052
It's my mom.
She won't stop calling me.

440
00:24:57,117 --> 00:24:58,482
You're lucky.

441
00:24:59,035 --> 00:25:02,743
My foster mother only keeps me for
the money she gets from the state.

442
00:25:03,266 --> 00:25:05,861
When I started barfing at dinner, she...

443
00:25:05,878 --> 00:25:09,311
loaded me into the ambulance
and then went back to her ham.

444
00:25:09,597 --> 00:25:12,750
So... she's not coming.

445
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:16,581
- That boy is smitten.
- Boys are easy.

446
00:25:17,207 --> 00:25:19,440
You know, Meg and Sarah
are out of town tonight?

447
00:25:19,457 --> 00:25:20,963
Liver looks good.

448
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:23,042
Which means I have
the place all to myself.

449
00:25:23,058 --> 00:25:27,083
- And why are you telling me this?
- 'Cause Meg and I, it's over.

450
00:25:27,085 --> 00:25:29,160
I thought you weren't together.

451
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:33,562
We weren't. But now we're not
even not together anymore.

452
00:25:35,027 --> 00:25:39,423
- Fat stranding and a cecal phlegmon.
- She needs the OR. I'll call Crenshaw.

453
00:25:41,397 --> 00:25:42,443
Sit down.

454
00:25:44,306 --> 00:25:47,152
I have a very important job
for you, okay?

455
00:25:47,356 --> 00:25:49,480
I don't want my mom to be alone.

456
00:25:49,495 --> 00:25:54,070
I want you to take that flashlight,
and point it wherever I'm working.

457
00:25:54,107 --> 00:25:55,743
Someone's gonna help her, right?

458
00:25:57,348 --> 00:25:59,590
The fire department's gonna be here soon.

459
00:25:59,877 --> 00:26:01,522
And they'll get her off the bus?

460
00:26:01,817 --> 00:26:02,951
Yeah.

461
00:26:03,807 --> 00:26:05,222
Promise?

462
00:26:07,495 --> 00:26:09,880
All right, don't move, okay?

463
00:26:10,775 --> 00:26:12,651
Just shine that light at me.

464
00:27:20,758 --> 00:27:26,941
Four dead, nine criticals,
14 minor injuries, 11 delayed.

465
00:27:27,576 --> 00:27:31,552
The driver had a passenger manifest,
and the numbers all match up.

466
00:27:31,565 --> 00:27:34,470
Good job. Good job.
All the criticals are off site.

467
00:27:34,485 --> 00:27:36,623
Does this include
the woman on the bus?

468
00:27:37,148 --> 00:27:39,771
No one's going back on that bus
until it's stabilized.

469
00:27:39,836 --> 00:27:41,501
Well, how long is that gonna take?

470
00:27:41,725 --> 00:27:44,153
The anchors aren't holding;
it could be hours.

471
00:27:44,207 --> 00:27:46,880
- She can't make it that long.
- There's nothing we can do about it!

472
00:27:46,896 --> 00:27:49,672
- We are not gonna endanger our guys!
- Calm down.

473
00:27:49,678 --> 00:27:52,110
Hey, nobody's getting back on that bus!

474
00:27:52,408 --> 00:27:55,502
- But she promised!
- She said you guys would go back!

475
00:27:55,518 --> 00:27:58,553
- Oh, yeah, what else you tell him?!
- Why don't you just back off...?

476
00:27:58,578 --> 00:28:00,032
- Mom!
- Hey! Hey!

477
00:28:00,048 --> 00:28:01,360
Mom!

478
00:28:02,768 --> 00:28:03,800
Milo!

479
00:28:05,098 --> 00:28:06,720
Hey! Hey!

480
00:28:08,327 --> 00:28:12,531
Milo, you... Milo, you cannot
get on that bus right now!

481
00:28:12,546 --> 00:28:14,633
- You said they would get her.
- I know.

482
00:28:14,656 --> 00:28:17,423
- You said they'd try.
- Okay.

483
00:28:17,547 --> 00:28:20,230
- You said they'd try.
- I know. It's gonna be okay.

484
00:28:21,896 --> 00:28:25,671
Come on, guys. Give him to me.
Pass him down.

485
00:28:26,057 --> 00:28:28,423
No! No!

486
00:28:39,486 --> 00:28:41,923
Get away!

487
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:46,122
Melanie?

488
00:28:49,468 --> 00:28:52,983
- Melanie? Can you hear me?
- Milo, he can't...

489
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:58,700
All right.
All right, everything's gonna be okay.

490
00:28:58,715 --> 00:29:01,652
- No, it's...
- Everything's gonna be all right.

491
00:29:01,746 --> 00:29:02,911
Hey!

492
00:29:03,205 --> 00:29:06,613
I need an IV and a liter of NS in here!

493
00:29:07,218 --> 00:29:09,871
His dad's in Milwaukee.

494
00:29:10,175 --> 00:29:12,872
- Would you... please tell him...
- Okay, Melanie.

495
00:29:13,116 --> 00:29:15,710
Melanie, listen to me.
Help is on the way, all right?

496
00:29:16,316 --> 00:29:20,781
Milo... Milo likes it...
if you break up his toast...

497
00:29:20,795 --> 00:29:23,572
- and scramble it with his eggs.
- Okay.

498
00:29:23,588 --> 00:29:27,093
He'll only let you comb his hair...

499
00:29:27,107 --> 00:29:30,773
if he's wearing his Ronaldinho jersey.

500
00:29:40,646 --> 00:29:42,160
Uh, uh, uh, uh.
No, no, no.

501
00:29:42,178 --> 00:29:46,640
Melanie, stay with me. Melanie, come on.
Stay with me.

502
00:29:46,658 --> 00:29:49,770
Melanie, tell me some more about Milo.
What does Milo like?

503
00:29:50,566 --> 00:29:54,162
He... he likes to sleep with
an inchworm named Charlie.

504
00:29:54,175 --> 00:29:57,173
- Okay, that's good. What else?
- Trying to get us all killed?

505
00:29:58,097 --> 00:30:00,441
I'm trying to keep her alive.

506
00:30:00,446 --> 00:30:03,330
- You are out of your mind.
- Well, what are you doing here?

507
00:30:03,336 --> 00:30:05,430
Thought you might need this.

508
00:30:14,297 --> 00:30:18,141
Hey, Katey, it's me.
Uh, I think you have my cell phone.

509
00:30:18,155 --> 00:30:22,081
Want to come by later and pick it up,
if that's okay. Call me.

510
00:30:22,415 --> 00:30:28,030
Marsupialized the abscess on your shooter,
sent the implanted chip to pathology,

511
00:30:28,047 --> 00:30:32,872
convinced Captain Kangaroo to stop eating
erasers, and what's the deal with the new nurse?

512
00:30:33,025 --> 00:30:34,690
- You mean Jane?
- Yeah.

513
00:30:34,706 --> 00:30:38,213
- What about her?
- Nothing. You know, just wondering.

514
00:30:38,227 --> 00:30:39,452
You like her.

515
00:30:39,857 --> 00:30:42,503
- Quiet, you silly infant.
- What about radiology?

516
00:30:42,518 --> 00:30:44,251
Alex loves the fluoroscope.

517
00:30:44,407 --> 00:30:47,901
- I went there. Nobody's seen him.
- Okay, can you check MRI?

518
00:30:47,917 --> 00:30:50,053
The tech there lets him
man the controls sometimes.

519
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,711
Sam, I got work to do.

520
00:30:51,715 --> 00:30:55,142
Jasmine Chastek, 17, fell down
a couple steps, positive LOC.

521
00:30:55,146 --> 00:30:57,641
- Hey, I'm Dr. Barnett.
- What happened?

522
00:30:57,658 --> 00:31:00,413
We were doing hits of nitrous
from whipped cream cans at Grandma's.

523
00:31:00,418 --> 00:31:02,913
She went a little overboard,
passed out on the basement stairs.

524
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:04,853
Okay, this should clean up just fine.

525
00:31:04,865 --> 00:31:09,411
Uh, I have to go find Alex.
Teenagers are such idiots.

526
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,740
Push harder!

527
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,010
It's stuck!

528
00:31:24,755 --> 00:31:26,231
Come on!

529
00:31:46,356 --> 00:31:47,701
Got to go!

530
00:31:49,266 --> 00:31:50,783
Now!

531
00:32:12,068 --> 00:32:15,022
- Can I have a cookie?
- Uh, yeah, but they really suck.

532
00:32:15,036 --> 00:32:17,003
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

533
00:32:17,308 --> 00:32:20,402
- Listen, your mom's looking for you.
- Ah, man, now I'm in trouble.

534
00:32:20,418 --> 00:32:21,943
No, she'll understand.

535
00:32:21,977 --> 00:32:24,530
No, I mean, everything I do
makes her angry.

536
00:32:24,546 --> 00:32:27,301
Sometimes you have to go
the extra mile for a girl.

537
00:32:27,586 --> 00:32:29,343
She'll get it. Trust me.

538
00:32:29,425 --> 00:32:31,630
Lulu's in recovery.
She's doing fine.

539
00:32:31,648 --> 00:32:32,653
Good.

540
00:32:33,638 --> 00:32:35,842
- Go get her.
- Yeah.

541
00:32:37,078 --> 00:32:39,203
We're getting a critical victim
in from a bus crash.

542
00:32:39,218 --> 00:32:41,123
I've got to go meet
a helicopter on the roof.

543
00:32:43,077 --> 00:32:44,910
Don't you need to be in the ER
or something?

544
00:32:44,915 --> 00:32:47,791
- No, my shift ended hours ago.
- Well, what are you still doing here?

545
00:32:47,805 --> 00:32:49,692
Waiting for you, dummy.

546
00:32:50,265 --> 00:32:52,902
Tony, you know, it's going to be a while.
I've got to get sign-out;

547
00:32:52,908 --> 00:32:54,370
- then I've got to take the patient to CT...
- All right, here's the deal.

548
00:32:54,386 --> 00:32:56,002
You're going home with me tonight.

549
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:58,021
Why is that the deal?

550
00:32:58,038 --> 00:33:02,433
Because there's nobody at my house.
It's Thanksgiving.

551
00:33:03,706 --> 00:33:08,922
And I really, really want
to make you... dinner.

552
00:33:16,235 --> 00:33:20,681
Okay, chocolate cherry.
Amazing, right?

553
00:33:20,735 --> 00:33:22,993
- Wow.
- Looks great to me.

554
00:33:23,005 --> 00:33:24,332
Hey, Greg.

555
00:33:24,356 --> 00:33:27,681
- Hey, I'm Dr. Greg Pratt.
- Oh, nice to meet you. Courtney Brown.

556
00:33:27,698 --> 00:33:30,200
- Courtney is my producer at Channel 5.
- Wow.

557
00:33:30,266 --> 00:33:32,392
You know, I think I might be able
to hang out for a while,

558
00:33:32,406 --> 00:33:34,171
if I can get my neighbor
to let the dog out.

559
00:33:34,185 --> 00:33:35,742
- I'll give her a call.
- Great.

560
00:33:38,648 --> 00:33:41,811
- Who is that?
- I just told you who she was.

561
00:33:42,477 --> 00:33:45,032
Come on, now, hook a brother up.

562
00:33:45,058 --> 00:33:49,440
You know what, your gaydar is
terrible, even for a straight man.

563
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:53,982
Oh, well, you...

564
00:33:54,275 --> 00:33:56,670
You have excellent taste
in women, Dr. Weaver.

565
00:33:56,686 --> 00:33:57,891
Of course I do.

566
00:33:58,487 --> 00:33:59,740
Hey, uh...

567
00:34:01,655 --> 00:34:03,231
Can I ask you something personal?

568
00:34:03,237 --> 00:34:04,580
Maybe.

569
00:34:06,386 --> 00:34:08,992
All right. How, um...

570
00:34:09,996 --> 00:34:11,681
No, no.

571
00:34:12,195 --> 00:34:15,430
When... did you know you were gay?

572
00:34:16,586 --> 00:34:18,840
Are you coming out to me, Greg?

573
00:34:18,865 --> 00:34:23,200
No, no, no, no. I came home and found
my brother with another guy.

574
00:34:24,647 --> 00:34:27,303
- Really?
- Yeah.

575
00:34:27,678 --> 00:34:31,060
He says he's just experimenting,
that it's only a phase.

576
00:34:31,826 --> 00:34:35,153
- And what do you think?
- I don't know.

577
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:37,932
Can a straight guy
go through a gay phase?

578
00:34:38,706 --> 00:34:42,273
I think it's more likely that he's gay.

579
00:34:43,068 --> 00:34:46,781
Hey, and he's telling you
what he thinks you want to hear.

580
00:34:47,227 --> 00:34:49,070
Okay, but for today, right,

581
00:34:49,075 --> 00:34:51,771
he's taking some hot girl from
school to the family Thanksgiving.

582
00:34:51,785 --> 00:34:54,601
Now, if he was gay,
why is he doing that?

583
00:34:54,617 --> 00:34:58,720
I don't know your brother. I mean,
I-I don't know what's going on in his head,

584
00:34:58,735 --> 00:35:04,250
but I do know that when I was that age,
I brought a lot of boys home to meet my parents.

585
00:35:04,708 --> 00:35:06,670
- You did?
- Hell, yeah.

586
00:35:06,685 --> 00:35:10,570
I mean, I was 30 before
I faced up to being gay,

587
00:35:10,585 --> 00:35:14,003
but my life got a lot better once I did.

588
00:35:38,505 --> 00:35:40,301
- Hey, Abby.
- Hey.

589
00:35:40,315 --> 00:35:43,871
- Your transport go okay?
- Um... yes.

590
00:35:44,207 --> 00:35:46,322
Well, be grateful you got
to skip out on this freak show.

591
00:35:46,335 --> 00:35:50,533
- It's been a real madhouse around here.
- Just got lucky, I guess.

592
00:35:50,925 --> 00:35:52,402
Hey, Lockhart.

593
00:35:53,536 --> 00:35:56,792
Hurry up and sign this
before I get called out again.

594
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:05,322
Bye.

595
00:36:06,686 --> 00:36:08,251
And thanks.

596
00:36:09,706 --> 00:36:11,692
You're pretty tough for a girl.

597
00:36:15,255 --> 00:36:17,011
Go to hell.

598
00:36:51,496 --> 00:36:53,113
- Hi.
- Hi.

599
00:36:53,646 --> 00:36:55,052
I was afraid you weren't
going to show up.

600
00:36:55,066 --> 00:36:57,881
Sorry, Crenshaw made me do
an I&D on my way out.

601
00:36:58,805 --> 00:37:00,701
Come on in.
Hope you're hungry.

602
00:37:00,907 --> 00:37:03,370
Couldn't do the turkey
thing so I made tacos.

603
00:37:08,745 --> 00:37:12,972
Homemade salsa, I got these tortillas
from the Salvadorian market on Fulton.

604
00:37:13,005 --> 00:37:15,191
- You ever been there?
- Uh, don't think so.

605
00:37:15,277 --> 00:37:16,890
Some wine.

606
00:37:21,736 --> 00:37:22,981
You okay?

607
00:37:23,716 --> 00:37:26,330
- Uh, yeah.
- Some more wine.

608
00:37:28,328 --> 00:37:30,590
- Want to take your jacket off?
- Uh, yeah.

609
00:37:30,606 --> 00:37:31,632
All right.

610
00:37:31,718 --> 00:37:33,692
Are you sure you're cool?
'Cause if you don't like Mexican food,

611
00:37:33,708 --> 00:37:37,762
- just say the word and you know.
- No, I'm fine. Really.

612
00:37:37,777 --> 00:37:41,552
It's just I haven't been in
a situation like this for a long time.

613
00:37:41,557 --> 00:37:43,802
- I know.
- It just feels a bit weird standing here

614
00:37:43,806 --> 00:37:45,973
knowing we're about to do
what we're about to do.

615
00:37:45,996 --> 00:37:47,531
What? Have dinner?

616
00:37:47,748 --> 00:37:50,372
Tony, I-I want to be here, I do.

617
00:37:51,128 --> 00:37:53,020
I mean, I've thought about it a lot.

618
00:37:53,035 --> 00:37:56,701
Not creepy-a-lot, but it's definitely
been on my mind

619
00:37:56,718 --> 00:38:00,492
and I wouldn't want you to be
worried that I don't really want...

620
00:38:05,456 --> 00:38:06,820
I'm not worried.

621
00:38:08,096 --> 00:38:10,070
We can take it as slow as you want.

622
00:38:13,277 --> 00:38:14,680
Slow?

623
00:38:26,016 --> 00:38:30,140
- Hey, stranger.
- Hey. Well, thank you.

624
00:38:30,436 --> 00:38:33,012
- And what are you doing here?
- Working.

625
00:38:33,508 --> 00:38:36,721
Surgeons are such bastards making
med students come in on Thanksgiving.

626
00:38:36,736 --> 00:38:38,103
That is really, really low.

627
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:42,030
No, actually, it's the bastards in the ER
who scheduled me for this.

628
00:38:42,045 --> 00:38:44,912
- What?
- I started an ER rotation.

629
00:38:45,336 --> 00:38:46,520
Tonight.

630
00:38:49,607 --> 00:38:51,971
Now, see, you said
you were never going to...

631
00:38:51,977 --> 00:38:55,012
Yeah, radiology fell through at
the last minute. I got reassigned.

632
00:38:55,028 --> 00:38:56,451
Don't freak out.
I'm not stalking you.

633
00:38:56,468 --> 00:38:59,152
- Okay, look, I can't evaluate you.
- We'll work it out.

634
00:38:59,158 --> 00:39:00,511
And I can't have these people thinking...

635
00:39:00,525 --> 00:39:02,522
- We'll work it out.
- Okay.

636
00:39:04,058 --> 00:39:05,533
Hey, Abby.

637
00:39:05,608 --> 00:39:07,330
What took so long?
You were out all night.

638
00:39:07,948 --> 00:39:10,883
Well, you know, sometimes
these things can take hours.

639
00:39:10,975 --> 00:39:13,130
You sure you weren't just having
sundaes with the team?

640
00:39:13,488 --> 00:39:16,590
Last run I did we burned off
the whole shift at the Plush Horse.

641
00:39:17,418 --> 00:39:18,882
Good for you, Ray.

642
00:39:19,216 --> 00:39:21,702
Well, well, well, look who's back.

643
00:39:21,807 --> 00:39:25,821
She got to soar over Chicago while we
dealt with maggots and colostomy bags.

644
00:39:25,836 --> 00:39:28,600
I guess I must have done
something good in a past life.

645
00:39:28,615 --> 00:39:31,663
Yeah, well, you look wiped. Transports can
do that to you if you're not used to it.

646
00:39:31,675 --> 00:39:33,391
- So you want me to get you a coffee? Or...
- No, thanks.

647
00:39:33,408 --> 00:39:35,740
Right now I really just want to go home.

648
00:39:35,756 --> 00:39:38,352
No, stay. We just got here.

649
00:39:41,705 --> 00:39:43,511
I missed you guys.

650
00:39:53,478 --> 00:39:57,010
I know we had no water or toilet paper...

651
00:39:58,805 --> 00:40:00,460
Oh, my God.

652
00:40:03,045 --> 00:40:05,130
Meg, Sarah, this is Neela.

653
00:40:14,828 --> 00:40:16,573
How many times do I have
to tell you, Tony?

654
00:40:16,588 --> 00:40:20,673
When you leave the glass directly
on the wood, it leaves a stain.

655
00:40:30,925 --> 00:40:32,730
- You hungry?
- Yeah, I'm starving.

656
00:40:32,747 --> 00:40:34,432
All right, let me get my stuff,
and then, uh,

657
00:40:34,448 --> 00:40:36,291
we can pick up something
at the chicken place.

658
00:40:43,216 --> 00:40:45,842
Sam, Alex, Happy Thanksgiving.

659
00:40:45,855 --> 00:40:47,722
There's some food over there,
help yourselves.

660
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:49,582
Wow, thanks, Luka.

661
00:40:50,618 --> 00:40:53,622
- Tofurkey anyone?
- Uh... no.

662
00:40:53,635 --> 00:40:56,150
- I'll try it.
- Are you really a vegan?

663
00:40:56,155 --> 00:40:59,111
Surgeons just shouldn't be carnivores.
It's a known fact.

664
00:41:00,437 --> 00:41:03,400
- What the hell is that?
- Looks like milk Jell-O.

665
00:41:03,416 --> 00:41:06,813
Mmm, no, coconut flan and it is killer.

666
00:41:07,576 --> 00:41:09,891
Oh, hey, Dr. Weaver, do you remember me?

667
00:41:09,905 --> 00:41:11,901
- Katey Alvaro.
- Oh, hi, Katey. How are you?

668
00:41:11,918 --> 00:41:14,821
I'm good. Um, I started my ER
rotation about an hour ago.

669
00:41:14,836 --> 00:41:18,061
Oh, yeah, well, I hope Ray's
giving you the lay of the land.

670
00:41:18,078 --> 00:41:19,941
Oh, yeah, he is. Definitely.

671
00:41:20,705 --> 00:41:24,331
All right, how do you stay
so skinny and eat so much?

672
00:41:24,346 --> 00:41:26,400
Uh, look who's talking,
little skinny mini.

673
00:41:26,416 --> 00:41:28,582
Well, it seems like good genes to me.

674
00:41:28,676 --> 00:41:31,852
You want to come over and watch some
football with me and Kerry tomorrow?

675
00:41:32,988 --> 00:41:34,751
Damn, you're lucky.

676
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:42,072
- I can't believe you made all this.
- Well, maybe I cheated a little.

677
00:41:44,206 --> 00:41:46,112
If anything happens to me
you'll remember that

678
00:41:46,126 --> 00:41:48,940
Joe likes strawberries but raspberries
give him hives, right?

679
00:41:48,957 --> 00:41:50,301
- What are you talking about?
- And...

680
00:41:50,315 --> 00:41:53,332
and if you put the ceiling fan on in the
bathroom, he doesn't cry when he's in tube.

681
00:41:53,347 --> 00:41:55,851
- I know that.
- And it's absolutely mandatory

682
00:41:55,867 --> 00:41:58,871
that he be exposed to everything
Stevie Wonder recorded in the '70s.

683
00:41:58,888 --> 00:42:03,182
Dr. Lockhart, that trauma
you choppered in did well in the OR.

684
00:42:03,195 --> 00:42:05,302
Oh, great. That's great.

685
00:42:05,317 --> 00:42:09,060
Yeah, it required over 12 units but,
uh, she's holding her own in recovery.

686
00:42:09,076 --> 00:42:10,111
Thanks.

687
00:42:11,615 --> 00:42:14,541
Are you okay?
How did the transport go?

688
00:42:20,117 --> 00:42:22,333
Hey, I have my kid here.

689
00:42:25,436 --> 00:42:27,881
It's Thanksgiving.
I'll tell you tomorrow.
