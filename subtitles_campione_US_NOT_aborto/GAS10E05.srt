1
00:00:01,962 --> 00:00:04,479
Here's what I learn
my first day at medical school...

2
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:09,015
think long and hard before choosing
to become a surgeon.

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,118
It takes 100% commitment.

4
00:00:15,356 --> 00:00:17,490
This is killing me.

5
00:00:20,427 --> 00:00:22,727
I need coffee.

6
00:00:22,762 --> 00:00:25,964
Four days back to work,
and I'm ready to end it all.

7
00:00:26,998 --> 00:00:29,572
I don't even know how we survive four days.

8
00:00:29,672 --> 00:00:31,669
- Coffee's on!
- That's how.

9
00:00:31,703 --> 00:00:33,204
You have to be on your "A" game

10
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:36,306
every single time you walk into that O.R.

11
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,408
When patients are lying
on your table

12
00:00:38,443 --> 00:00:39,842
completely at your mercy,

13
00:00:39,877 --> 00:00:42,245
they need to know that when
you make that first cut...

14
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,082
you know what you're doing.

15
00:00:46,784 --> 00:00:49,852
No other specialty requires the time,
the focus,

16
00:00:49,887 --> 00:00:52,354
the complete dedication...

17
00:00:52,389 --> 00:00:55,491
except maybe being a mom.

18
00:00:55,525 --> 00:00:58,594
Okay, so daddy is gonna
drop you off at day care,

19
00:00:58,628 --> 00:01:00,077
and I am going to pick you up, okay?

20
00:01:00,177 --> 00:01:01,451
Then we'll have a princess tea party

21
00:01:01,551 --> 00:01:03,399
- at the end of the day.
- Okay, ladies, let's go.

22
00:01:04,766 --> 00:01:06,702
Wow. We're good at this.

23
00:01:06,736 --> 00:01:08,570
Oh, pump!

24
00:01:08,604 --> 00:01:09,604
Yeah. Oh!

25
00:01:09,638 --> 00:01:10,972
- Okay. Mwah!
- Mwah.

26
00:01:13,809 --> 00:01:16,043
Maybe we're too good at this.

27
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,615
James Evans, 57, post-op day 6

28
00:01:20,649 --> 00:01:22,583
from an emergent tricuspid valve replacement

29
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:25,288
- due to endocarditis.
- Hey, could you change it to "Jimmy"?

30
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,088
And go ahead and fix the age,
while you're at it,

31
00:01:27,122 --> 00:01:29,356
to something in the 40s.

32
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,726
Deep breath.

33
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,028
- Is that thing you put in there still working?
- I think you're good.

34
00:01:34,062 --> 00:01:35,796
The new valve should last 10 to 15 years.

35
00:01:35,831 --> 00:01:36,897
Dr. Wilson's going to do

36
00:01:36,932 --> 00:01:38,265
a treadmill stress echocardiogram

37
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:40,333
- just to be thorough.
- Thanks, doc.

38
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:41,968
Anything to get me out of this dress.

39
00:01:42,003 --> 00:01:43,637
Okay.

40
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:48,207
Oh. U.N.O.S. has a possible match

41
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:49,609
on one my transplant patients.

42
00:01:49,644 --> 00:01:51,611
- Uh, page me with his results.
- Okay.

43
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:59,885
- Looking at your dad's chart?
- He's not my dad.

44
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:02,021
That's why I took my mom's last name.

45
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:04,422
So there's nothing connecting me to the guy.

46
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:07,026
- He's funny.
- Yeah?

47
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,561
You should talk to him.
Tell him who you are.

48
00:02:09,595 --> 00:02:10,729
Maybe he's changed. You've changed.

49
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:11,996
The last time I saw his face,

50
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:14,766
I was punching him so hard,
I could have killed him.

51
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,969
I'm just afraid
I'll pick up where I left off.

52
00:02:20,305 --> 00:02:21,505
Hey!

53
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,108
- You're doing a heart/liver on Samantha Calder?
- Yep.

54
00:02:24,143 --> 00:02:25,176
I saw her before I went on leave.

55
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,477
I'm the one who diagnosed

56
00:02:26,511 --> 00:02:27,744
the familial hypercholesterolemia.

57
00:02:27,779 --> 00:02:30,246
- Oh, well, you were right.
- So let me take the liver.

58
00:02:30,281 --> 00:02:32,082
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

59
00:02:32,116 --> 00:02:33,817
Why didn't you think of me
in the first place?

60
00:02:33,851 --> 00:02:35,585
I guess I thought you were easing back in?

61
00:02:35,619 --> 00:02:37,754
I don't ease back in.
I jump in the deep end.

62
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:39,956
- I swim.
- All right.

63
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:41,925
Uh, well, have you read
the Cleveland article

64
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:44,294
on simultaneous heart/liver
transplants under C.P.B.?

65
00:02:44,328 --> 00:02:46,663
I have not. Is it different
from a regular heart/liver?

66
00:02:47,665 --> 00:02:49,499
I will read it.

67
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:50,966
Hey, you're doing a heart/liver?

68
00:02:51,001 --> 00:02:52,835
Yeah. Uh, but I don't need you.

69
00:02:52,869 --> 00:02:54,637
You paged me.

70
00:02:56,139 --> 00:02:58,040
You stole my liver?

71
00:02:58,075 --> 00:03:00,875
Uh... come on. I deserve this.

72
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,044
- I've been on the bench for months.
- You deserve nothing.

73
00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:05,314
I named my son after you.

74
00:03:05,348 --> 00:03:07,382
You can't be mad at me.

75
00:03:07,417 --> 00:03:08,417
Your son is the devil's spawn.

76
00:03:08,451 --> 00:03:10,485
He drinks the milk of a liver thief!

77
00:03:12,722 --> 00:03:14,055
Morning, Dr. Kepner,

78
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,624
- Dr. Robbins.
- Mm. Hi.

79
00:03:15,658 --> 00:03:17,625
Coffee? I thought you could use it

80
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:19,360
before your big surgery with Dr. Shepherd.

81
00:03:19,394 --> 00:03:20,761
Oh.

82
00:03:20,795 --> 00:03:22,630
That's... nice.

83
00:03:26,635 --> 00:03:28,569
What did I do?

84
00:03:28,604 --> 00:03:30,871
Something nice, apparently.
I didn't get a coffee.

85
00:03:30,905 --> 00:03:33,673
No.

86
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:37,877
No. I think I actually did
something really, really bad.

87
00:03:37,911 --> 00:03:39,846
I think that I brought
her back to my apartment

88
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,081
- the night of the gala.
- You think?

89
00:03:42,116 --> 00:03:43,082
I don't know. I was drunk.

90
00:03:43,117 --> 00:03:44,351
I barely remember even getting home.

91
00:03:44,385 --> 00:03:46,085
And then I have a vague
memory of her in my kitchen.

92
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,387
And now she's being really friendly.

93
00:03:47,421 --> 00:03:49,054
Did I flirt with her that night?

94
00:03:49,088 --> 00:03:51,657
Uh, all I remember

95
00:03:51,691 --> 00:03:53,892
is waking up in my bathtub
with my spanx still on.

96
00:03:53,926 --> 00:03:55,427
Oh, well, at least we know you're good.

97
00:03:55,462 --> 00:03:58,864
Oh.

98
00:03:58,898 --> 00:04:01,700
Hey, um, some mortgage slips
for the apartment came.

99
00:04:01,735 --> 00:04:03,602
Oh.

100
00:04:03,637 --> 00:04:04,769
Okay.

101
00:04:04,803 --> 00:04:05,936
You're welcome.

102
00:04:08,307 --> 00:04:09,507
You want me to thank you for giving me

103
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,376
the mortgage slips to my apartment

104
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,610
that you're living in?

105
00:04:12,645 --> 00:04:15,112
Listen, if you want me
to move out, just say so.

106
00:04:15,147 --> 00:04:16,281
I don't want to live in the apartment

107
00:04:16,315 --> 00:04:17,582
that I shared with my cheating wife.

108
00:04:17,616 --> 00:04:19,350
I gotta go. Thanks!

109
00:04:26,924 --> 00:04:29,326
- I think I overslept.
- What do you think?

110
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,194
Of?

111
00:04:31,228 --> 00:04:33,297
- My shirt?
- Yes.

112
00:04:33,331 --> 00:04:34,631
You're introducing me to your mother.

113
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:35,999
I need to make a good impression,

114
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:37,900
so I am going for,

115
00:04:37,934 --> 00:04:40,002
"Yes, I am an intern dating your son"

116
00:04:40,036 --> 00:04:42,871
"who is a fellow and a member
of the board and an Avery."

117
00:04:42,906 --> 00:04:45,675
"But before you write me off
as a gold digger,"

118
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:48,177
"you need to know I am a kick-ass surgeon,"

119
00:04:48,211 --> 00:04:50,313
"and your son is lucky to be dating me."

120
00:04:50,347 --> 00:04:52,114
That is a lot of pressure to put on a shirt.

121
00:04:52,148 --> 00:04:53,748
Oh, it's not working alone.

122
00:04:53,783 --> 00:04:55,883
There's a lip gloss in
my locker that'll assist.

123
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:57,285
Oh, yeah.

124
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,320
Well, she is gonna love you.

125
00:05:00,989 --> 00:05:03,124
- Mm. Not-not here.
- Hmm?

126
00:05:03,158 --> 00:05:04,559
- What?
- Stop. We're not those people.

127
00:05:04,593 --> 00:05:06,695
Oh, I know. Yeah.

128
00:05:07,996 --> 00:05:11,031
Banana bread.

129
00:05:11,065 --> 00:05:12,232
I'm starving... Mmm.

130
00:05:12,266 --> 00:05:13,634
Help yourself.

131
00:05:13,668 --> 00:05:17,037
I was too busy
feeding my family breakfast

132
00:05:17,071 --> 00:05:18,806
and getting my sister
wife's breast pump packed

133
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,676
- to feed myself this morning.
- So... you have a sister wife?

134
00:05:22,711 --> 00:05:24,311
Derek and Meredith and I
are in a relationship.

135
00:05:24,345 --> 00:05:25,511
Huh.

136
00:05:25,546 --> 00:05:26,979
I used to dance in my underwear.

137
00:05:27,013 --> 00:05:28,848
And I thought I'd get back
to that when I left Arizona.

138
00:05:28,882 --> 00:05:30,750
Instead I walked right into "big love."

139
00:05:30,784 --> 00:05:32,852
I rebounded to the McDreamys.

140
00:05:32,886 --> 00:05:35,221
Mm.

141
00:05:35,255 --> 00:05:37,690
- Hmm, hang glider trauma?
- Yeah.

142
00:05:37,725 --> 00:05:39,392
Where did you get this?
It's amazing.

143
00:05:39,426 --> 00:05:40,392
- It's good, right?
- Mm-hmm.

144
00:05:40,426 --> 00:05:41,893
- Emma made it.
- Mmm.

145
00:05:41,927 --> 00:05:44,028
- Fetal surgeon Emma from the gala?
- Mm-hmm.

146
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:46,531
Oh, my god. You're rebounding, too.

147
00:05:46,566 --> 00:05:48,400
Mm. Yeah.

148
00:05:48,434 --> 00:05:51,970
- What have we got?
- Her name is Reese Woods, 22.

149
00:05:52,004 --> 00:05:53,739
Hang gliding over tiger mountain,

150
00:05:53,773 --> 00:05:55,974
B.P.'s 100/70, open tibia fracture,

151
00:05:56,008 --> 00:05:57,775
and complains of abdominal pain.

152
00:05:57,809 --> 00:05:59,343
Can I say, "I told you so," now, Reese?

153
00:05:59,378 --> 00:06:01,044
Who's this?

154
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:02,680
- Oh, that's Donna. She's the sister.
- Mm.

155
00:06:02,714 --> 00:06:04,415
Although she acts like she's my mother.

156
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:05,683
I am not doing this again.

157
00:06:05,717 --> 00:06:07,785
I'm not watching you try to kill yourself.

158
00:06:07,819 --> 00:06:09,487
It's just a little break. Don't be so mad.

159
00:06:09,521 --> 00:06:10,688
Okay, this isn't bone.
This is a rod.

160
00:06:10,722 --> 00:06:12,589
When did you have this rod put in?

161
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:15,224
This March. She broke it
heli-skiing in New Zealand.

162
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:17,326
She's also broken, uh, both forearms,

163
00:06:17,361 --> 00:06:19,362
lost a kidney, dislocated her shoulder.

164
00:06:19,397 --> 00:06:20,764
Wow, you really do have a death wish, huh?

165
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:22,799
I guess I'm just making up for lost time.

166
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,267
I'm seeing a lot of free
fluid in Morrison's pouch.

167
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,168
We're gonna need to get her up to C.T. stat.

168
00:06:28,272 --> 00:06:30,472
Okay, now show Catherine
your party trick, sir.

169
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:38,547
Yeah.

170
00:06:38,581 --> 00:06:42,551
Oh! Oh, he's acting all too cool
for school right now.

171
00:06:42,585 --> 00:06:45,553
But yesterday,
when he made it to the chair,

172
00:06:45,587 --> 00:06:48,255
he was smiling from ear-to-ear.

173
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,924
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.

174
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,325
Oh!

175
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:52,593
You are doing so well!

176
00:06:52,628 --> 00:06:54,829
I think you'll be doing laps by next week.

177
00:06:54,863 --> 00:06:58,900
Excuse me, sir. Your, uh,
drain output has been a little low,

178
00:06:58,934 --> 00:07:01,735
and we were told to come
by to strip your J.P.

179
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:03,804
We can come back later if
this isn't a good time.

180
00:07:03,838 --> 00:07:07,106
Well, I actually wanted
to talk with Dr. Bailey.

181
00:07:07,141 --> 00:07:09,375
so right now is a great time.

182
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:14,213
I need a hand to get back in bed.

183
00:07:14,248 --> 00:07:16,715
Well, what are you two waiting for?
Help the man!

184
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,983
- Oh, yeah.
- Of course.

185
00:07:18,017 --> 00:07:20,419
Okay.

186
00:07:22,188 --> 00:07:24,757
I was expecting more.

187
00:07:26,793 --> 00:07:28,360
But he couldn't sit up two days ago.

188
00:07:28,394 --> 00:07:29,795
He's depressed.

189
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:32,464
- Have you considered antidepressants?
- Of course I have.

190
00:07:32,498 --> 00:07:35,700
And he refuses.
He says he's fine, and he is.

191
00:07:35,734 --> 00:07:39,103
He needs time, support, and more pillows

192
00:07:39,137 --> 00:07:40,939
if he's ever gonna be able
to sit up comfortably.

193
00:07:40,973 --> 00:07:42,607
I'm gonna go get those.

194
00:07:42,641 --> 00:07:45,009
Miranda... I'm so sorry.

195
00:07:45,043 --> 00:07:48,612
You've done so much, and I am grateful.

196
00:07:48,646 --> 00:07:50,948
I'm here to help. So let me.

197
00:07:50,982 --> 00:07:52,983
All right.

198
00:07:53,017 --> 00:07:55,018
Pillows.

199
00:07:57,321 --> 00:07:58,989
Oh, my god!

200
00:07:59,023 --> 00:08:01,558
Oh...

201
00:08:01,593 --> 00:08:02,659
Hi.

202
00:08:02,694 --> 00:08:06,395
Jackson... where are your manners?

203
00:08:06,429 --> 00:08:08,865
Mom, this is Stephanie Edwards.

204
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:11,534
Steph, this is my mom.

205
00:08:11,568 --> 00:08:14,570
Dear, would you mind handing me the pillows

206
00:08:14,605 --> 00:08:16,071
from the top bunk?

207
00:08:21,978 --> 00:08:23,545
Okay.

208
00:08:23,579 --> 00:08:24,980
Mm.

209
00:08:28,384 --> 00:08:31,753
- I don't think she liked my shirt.
- Mm.

210
00:08:45,727 --> 00:08:47,340
- Ma, hold on.
- You are aware that

211
00:08:47,374 --> 00:08:49,003
you're on the board of this hospital,

212
00:08:49,103 --> 00:08:50,744
as well as an Avery.

213
00:08:50,778 --> 00:08:52,979
You don't know what I went through

214
00:08:53,013 --> 00:08:55,156
- to get these pillows.
- Meant to lock the door.

215
00:08:55,256 --> 00:08:57,616
Good morning, sir.
How are you feeling today?

216
00:08:57,716 --> 00:08:58,996
He's a mess.

217
00:08:59,118 --> 00:09:00,918
Who taped this I.V.?

218
00:09:00,953 --> 00:09:03,622
- It's fine.
- Maybe it was Edwards.

219
00:09:03,656 --> 00:09:05,590
Her mind's obviously not on patient care.

220
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,959
- That is not fair, mom.
- This is not me being a prude.

221
00:09:07,993 --> 00:09:10,128
I like sex just as much as the next person.

222
00:09:10,162 --> 00:09:12,296
- Oh, god, please.
- But there is a time and there's a place.

223
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:15,399
- He said he meant to lock the door.
- You be quiet.

224
00:09:15,433 --> 00:09:17,200
Where are your compression socks?

225
00:09:17,235 --> 00:09:18,702
They went to get another pair.

226
00:09:18,737 --> 00:09:21,438
- Maybe they got distracted by Edwards' breasts.
- And I'm out.

227
00:09:21,473 --> 00:09:24,775
I'm just looking out for you.

228
00:09:24,809 --> 00:09:27,176
Hey, Sam.

229
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,512
Dr. Grey... where's your baby belly?

230
00:09:29,546 --> 00:09:31,247
It turned into a baby boy.

231
00:09:31,282 --> 00:09:33,249
Congratulations.

232
00:09:33,284 --> 00:09:35,151
I would show you a picture,
but he's so cute,

233
00:09:35,185 --> 00:09:37,052
you may have another heart attack.

234
00:09:37,087 --> 00:09:38,321
Oh.

235
00:09:38,355 --> 00:09:40,356
- She's had a bunch of them.
- Not recently, though.

236
00:09:40,391 --> 00:09:42,991
- I think the yoga music helps.
- Absolutely.

237
00:09:43,025 --> 00:09:45,193
- He hates the music.
- I loved it...

238
00:09:45,227 --> 00:09:46,795
- Hmm-hmm.
- For the first few months.

239
00:09:46,829 --> 00:09:49,931
Well, now that we're getting you
a new heart and liver,

240
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:51,099
you can flip out like the rest of us.

241
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:53,502
And have a baby, like Dr. Grey.

242
00:09:53,536 --> 00:09:56,805
Or be a ground-breaking surgeon,
like Dr. Yang.

243
00:09:56,839 --> 00:09:58,906
I'm a surgeon, too.

244
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,008
Oh, yeah. Of course.

245
00:10:01,042 --> 00:10:02,743
Dr. Grey does it all.

246
00:10:02,778 --> 00:10:05,012
It's so impressive.

247
00:10:05,046 --> 00:10:08,716
- I don't know how you handle everything.
- I don't know either sometimes.

248
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,288
- What?
- Did you want to examine the patient?

249
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,555
Oh.

250
00:10:18,992 --> 00:10:22,061
Hello, Mr. Samuels. I'm Dr. Edwards.

251
00:10:22,095 --> 00:10:23,830
It says here you haven't
been able to urinate

252
00:10:23,864 --> 00:10:25,498
since yesterday. Let's take a look.

253
00:10:25,533 --> 00:10:27,434
Wow-wow.

254
00:10:27,468 --> 00:10:29,736
Uh, it's no wonder you can't urinate.

255
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,437
Your penis is quite swollen.

256
00:10:31,471 --> 00:10:32,838
I think I got a bug bite.

257
00:10:32,872 --> 00:10:34,673
That's a big bug bite.

258
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:37,976
It's... more of a bee sting than a bug bite.

259
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,745
Still pretty swollen for a bee sting.

260
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:41,714
Do you have a history of allergies?

261
00:10:41,748 --> 00:10:43,181
It wasn't really one bee. It was several.

262
00:10:43,216 --> 00:10:44,516
Well, what's several?

263
00:10:44,551 --> 00:10:47,184
I don't know...

264
00:10:47,219 --> 00:10:49,119
25? 30?

265
00:10:49,154 --> 00:10:50,621
30 bees?

266
00:10:50,656 --> 00:10:52,390
I know. It's crazy, right?

267
00:10:52,424 --> 00:10:54,291
- Hmm?
- But see, it was Saturday,

268
00:10:54,326 --> 00:10:56,627
and we have this hammock in the backyard.

269
00:10:56,662 --> 00:10:57,962
And I thought I'd make some lunch.

270
00:10:57,996 --> 00:11:04,668
So I took my pants off and...
made a honey sandwich.

271
00:11:04,702 --> 00:11:06,970
Wh... a honey sandwich?

272
00:11:07,004 --> 00:11:08,805
Peanut butter and honey sandwich.

273
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,574
'Cause who eats a honey sandwich, right?

274
00:11:10,608 --> 00:11:12,809
- Right.
- And I was eating the honey sandwich.

275
00:11:12,844 --> 00:11:16,346
And I fell asleep.
And I guess I got some honey on...

276
00:11:16,381 --> 00:11:18,547
myself.

277
00:11:19,683 --> 00:11:22,485
And the bees caught the scent.

278
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:24,052
Okay.

279
00:11:24,087 --> 00:11:25,721
Mm-hmm.

280
00:11:25,756 --> 00:11:28,457
Well, I'm gonna get you
a dose of I.V. Benadryl

281
00:11:28,492 --> 00:11:29,759
and a steroid.

282
00:11:29,793 --> 00:11:31,527
And then we're gonna get you
a catheter so you can pee.

283
00:11:31,561 --> 00:11:32,762
Dr. Edwards.

284
00:11:32,796 --> 00:11:35,530
Would it make a difference
if it were hornets?

285
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,001
The patient is a 14-year-old male...

286
00:11:43,338 --> 00:11:44,806
All right, one second. Excuse me.

287
00:11:47,777 --> 00:11:49,778
Fourth day back,
and I'm already scrubbing in

288
00:11:49,812 --> 00:11:51,512
on a heart/liver transplant with Cristina.

289
00:11:51,546 --> 00:11:52,579
- Well, fantastic!
- Yeah.

290
00:11:52,614 --> 00:11:54,047
Can you pick up the kids this afternoon?

291
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:56,037
I would, but I have to
entertain all of them.

292
00:11:56,137 --> 00:11:58,557
They're visiting neurosurgeons
watching my A.V.M.

293
00:11:58,657 --> 00:12:01,509
- Q&a after.
- I promised Zola a princess tea party.

294
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:02,623
Have Callie do tea.

295
00:12:02,657 --> 00:12:04,691
It was supposed to be me,
or in a pinch, you.

296
00:12:04,726 --> 00:12:05,826
It's so she knows that

297
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,727
she hasn't been replaced in our hearts

298
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:10,262
by a new baby brother or
by a multi-organ transplant.

299
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:11,964
It's an over-determined tea party.

300
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:14,300
I'll talk to Callie.

301
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:21,407
I didn't realize
I'd have to work this hard

302
00:12:21,442 --> 00:12:23,809
- to get out of here.
- Five more minutes.

303
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:26,411
I lost out on three gigs
since I've been in here.

304
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:28,346
If I can play tonight,

305
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,915
maybe this trip won't be a total wash.

306
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:32,183
Do you have any family or anyone I can call

307
00:12:32,217 --> 00:12:34,719
- To come pick you up?
- No, I'm good.

308
00:12:37,222 --> 00:12:40,290
How about I make a call to a rehab clinic?

309
00:12:40,325 --> 00:12:42,760
Don't you worry about me, darlin'.

310
00:12:42,794 --> 00:12:44,428
I know I had some junk in my
system when I came in here,

311
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,096
but I'm a recreational user.

312
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,365
Your left arm, right arm,
and the backs of both your knees

313
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,667
tell a different story.

314
00:12:49,701 --> 00:12:52,135
It took me half an hour to
find a usable vein on you.

315
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,671
I know what you're gonna
do when you leave here.

316
00:12:53,705 --> 00:12:55,505
I've got people I can call. I got family.

317
00:12:55,539 --> 00:12:57,841
I don't think you do. Or maybe you did,

318
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,408
but I think that you're on your own now.

319
00:12:59,443 --> 00:13:02,779
Well, you know all about me, don't you?

320
00:13:02,813 --> 00:13:06,449
I know that we have you
on methadone right now,

321
00:13:06,484 --> 00:13:08,184
which is a big step towards recovery.

322
00:13:08,218 --> 00:13:09,786
Let's just try to keep it going somewhere...

323
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,088
Kid, I play blues guitar.

324
00:13:13,122 --> 00:13:15,290
I'm not Christina Aguilera.

325
00:13:15,324 --> 00:13:17,058
I can't afford those places,
not the good ones.

326
00:13:17,093 --> 00:13:19,327
Let me make some calls for you, please.

327
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,430
Boy...

328
00:13:22,465 --> 00:13:25,200
you are as persistent as you are annoying.

329
00:13:25,234 --> 00:13:28,703
You can walk as fast as you want,

330
00:13:28,737 --> 00:13:29,871
but you're not going anywhere.

331
00:13:29,905 --> 00:13:32,607
Neither am I.

332
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:35,442
What is wrong with Callie?
She still hasn't called me back.

333
00:13:35,477 --> 00:13:37,378
Ooh! Ooh!

334
00:13:37,412 --> 00:13:39,046
Ah, the recovery team texted,

335
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,481
two minutes until they open the donor.

336
00:13:40,516 --> 00:13:42,282
Hey, Ross? Could you run down

337
00:13:42,317 --> 00:13:44,485
to the E.R. and ask Torres
if she can pick up the kids today?

338
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,153
Sure, but I have to get
this blood to the lab...

339
00:13:46,187 --> 00:13:48,122
And remind her about the princess tea party.

340
00:13:48,156 --> 00:13:50,024
It has to be today.

341
00:13:50,058 --> 00:13:51,992
Well, that's pretty cool.

342
00:13:52,027 --> 00:13:53,060
The tea party? Yeah.

343
00:13:53,094 --> 00:13:54,461
I mean, it's just apple juice and cookies,

344
00:13:54,496 --> 00:13:56,030
but she's excited about it.

345
00:13:56,064 --> 00:13:57,364
Not the tea party.

346
00:13:57,399 --> 00:13:59,332
You and me doing ground-breaking surgery...

347
00:13:59,366 --> 00:14:00,833
That was the idea when we started.

348
00:14:00,867 --> 00:14:03,002
Yeah. It's pretty cool.

349
00:14:04,371 --> 00:14:06,872
- Do you need to go pump?
- No, I'm fine.

350
00:14:06,907 --> 00:14:08,374
You're holding your boobs.

351
00:14:08,409 --> 00:14:10,876
But we're having a moment.
I don't want to spoil it.

352
00:14:10,911 --> 00:14:14,847
- Mer... your boobs are exploding. Go pump.
- Thank you.

353
00:14:18,051 --> 00:14:20,118
- So she might lose the kidney?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, let's...

354
00:14:20,153 --> 00:14:22,187
- let's not jump ahead.
- No, please.

355
00:14:22,221 --> 00:14:24,256
Worst-case scenario. I like to be prepared.

356
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:26,691
Well, the worst-case scenario
is she needs a kidney.

357
00:14:26,725 --> 00:14:28,927
So we start to look for a donor.

358
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,397
Okay. Well, that's me.

359
00:14:33,432 --> 00:14:36,767
I'm her donor. So you've
been through this before?

360
00:14:36,801 --> 00:14:40,171
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Take your pick...

361
00:14:40,205 --> 00:14:43,574
bone marrow, blood, uh, liver,

362
00:14:43,608 --> 00:14:45,176
anything you can think of, I've given.

363
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:46,544
What's mine is hers.

364
00:14:46,578 --> 00:14:49,312
Except I haven't given a kidney yet. So...

365
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:50,513
Yay!

366
00:14:50,548 --> 00:14:51,714
Sounds like she's extremely accident-prone,

367
00:14:51,748 --> 00:14:53,349
even for a daredevil.

368
00:14:53,384 --> 00:14:56,619
No. All the parachuting and stuff...

369
00:14:56,653 --> 00:14:59,289
it started when she went into remission.

370
00:14:59,323 --> 00:15:01,524
My sister was diagnosed with aplastic anemia

371
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:03,758
- when she was 2.
- Well, that must have been hard.

372
00:15:03,793 --> 00:15:05,260
It was lucky that you were a match.

373
00:15:05,295 --> 00:15:07,262
Oh, it wasn't luck.

374
00:15:07,297 --> 00:15:08,464
I'm a donor baby.

375
00:15:08,498 --> 00:15:10,765
You're her younger sister.

376
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,167
Yeah.

377
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,503
My parents only had me to save her.

378
00:15:27,148 --> 00:15:29,722
Aah!

379
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,874
How did that happen?

380
00:15:32,116 --> 00:15:33,891
It's a long story.

381
00:15:33,926 --> 00:15:35,893
Can you see any access
to get the catheter in?

382
00:15:35,928 --> 00:15:37,561
No, it's too swollen.

383
00:15:37,595 --> 00:15:39,430
It looks like it was mauled
by a pissed off badger.

384
00:15:39,464 --> 00:15:40,998
You should have seen it before
the I.V. Benadryl kicked in.

385
00:15:41,033 --> 00:15:42,867
Aah!

386
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:45,569
We need to get someone
from urology down here now.

387
00:15:45,603 --> 00:15:48,238
Don't you think I tried?
There's an emergency,

388
00:15:48,272 --> 00:15:50,673
and the on-call guy is 20 minutes away.

389
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:53,043
Dr. Wilson,
it feels like I might explode.

390
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,011
I don't think he's gonna last 20 minutes.

391
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,984
Dr. Avery, I'm...

392
00:16:01,018 --> 00:16:02,252
Darling, save your breath.

393
00:16:02,286 --> 00:16:04,653
There is nothing you can
say after this morning

394
00:16:04,687 --> 00:16:06,655
- to get in my good graces.
- I have a giant penis.

395
00:16:07,724 --> 00:16:09,558
No, not me. I don't have a gi...

396
00:16:09,592 --> 00:16:11,793
I'm a girl. Uh... I have a patient,

397
00:16:11,828 --> 00:16:13,863
and he has a giant penis.

398
00:16:13,897 --> 00:16:15,998
It's the biggest one I've ever seen,

399
00:16:16,032 --> 00:16:17,032
and I've seen a lot of...

400
00:16:17,067 --> 00:16:18,700
You make me nervous.

401
00:16:18,735 --> 00:16:21,169
I need a consult.

402
00:16:21,203 --> 00:16:22,737
Better go take a look.

403
00:16:26,275 --> 00:16:29,878
This rod caused a lot of bleeding.

404
00:16:29,912 --> 00:16:31,612
We're gonna be here a while.

405
00:16:31,646 --> 00:16:33,581
- I hope you don't have plans
with your girlfriend, Hunt.
- She's not my girlfriend.

406
00:16:33,615 --> 00:16:35,316
She baked you banana bread

407
00:16:35,351 --> 00:16:37,550
and brought it to you at work.
You're practically engaged.

408
00:16:37,585 --> 00:16:38,651
Matthew brought me breakfast burritos,

409
00:16:38,686 --> 00:16:40,420
and now we're getting married.

410
00:16:40,454 --> 00:16:42,155
Just saying.

411
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:44,958
Damn it.
The superior pole of this kidney

412
00:16:44,993 --> 00:16:46,126
is almost completely avulsed,

413
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,594
and the pedicle is gonna need some repair.

414
00:16:47,628 --> 00:16:49,796
You think the sister's
prepared to consider donation?

415
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:50,964
She can't seem to say no.

416
00:16:50,999 --> 00:16:52,798
- Dr. Torres?
- Hmm?

417
00:16:52,832 --> 00:16:54,300
Dr. Grey is going into surgery.

418
00:16:54,334 --> 00:16:55,935
She wants to know if you can
pick up her kids at 3:00.

419
00:16:55,969 --> 00:16:58,704
She said to mention promising
Zola a princess tea party?

420
00:16:58,738 --> 00:17:01,840
Tell her I'll be
out of here by... 6:00.

421
00:17:03,176 --> 00:17:05,477
So she can't say no.

422
00:17:05,512 --> 00:17:08,246
Oh, my god. You're right.

423
00:17:08,281 --> 00:17:09,580
I need to get a life.

424
00:17:09,615 --> 00:17:11,116
You know what?
Maybe I should kick Arizona out

425
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:13,118
- and move back into my place.
- But she needs the elevator.

426
00:17:13,152 --> 00:17:14,552
And it's right across
the street from the hospital,

427
00:17:14,586 --> 00:17:16,521
which is perfect for her.

428
00:17:16,555 --> 00:17:19,791
We drank three bottles
of champagne and puked.

429
00:17:19,825 --> 00:17:22,527
- It bonds you.
- Mm-hmm.

430
00:17:22,561 --> 00:17:23,561
Plus it's already been retrofitted

431
00:17:23,595 --> 00:17:25,296
- to be handicap-accessible.
- Kepner...

432
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:26,203
I'm shutting up.

433
00:17:26,303 --> 00:17:28,165
No, no. Look at the kidney.
We're gonna need some laps

434
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:30,867
And a vascular clamp.
Kepner, get the 4-0 prolene stitch.

435
00:17:30,902 --> 00:17:32,836
Mm-hmm.

436
00:17:34,639 --> 00:17:36,506
Of course,
now my mom's convinced that Stephanie

437
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,508
is some kind of gold digger,
trying to use sex

438
00:17:38,543 --> 00:17:39,876
to nab herself an Avery.

439
00:17:39,911 --> 00:17:41,177
Dude, you and your rich boy problems.

440
00:17:41,211 --> 00:17:42,312
You know what the worst part is?

441
00:17:42,346 --> 00:17:43,879
I think she actually likes Stephanie.

442
00:17:43,914 --> 00:17:46,049
Well, so then you need
to tell your mom that.

443
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,483
Stand up for your girl.

444
00:17:47,517 --> 00:17:49,785
That wouldn't work.
She'd just hate her even more.

445
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,754
- So what are you gonna do?
- Nothing.

446
00:17:51,788 --> 00:17:53,789
You know, it's like walking
into a hornet's nest.

447
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:56,458
You know, you gotta stay still,
let the whole frenzy die down.

448
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,460
How you doin'
with that coffee, Karev?

449
00:17:58,494 --> 00:17:59,861
You wanna make the damn coffee?

450
00:17:59,895 --> 00:18:02,064
Be my guest. It's a freakin' crap machine.

451
00:18:02,098 --> 00:18:03,999
What's wrong with him?

452
00:18:04,033 --> 00:18:06,835
Beats me.

453
00:18:06,869 --> 00:18:10,405
- Alex just broke the coffee machine.
- You're dead to me.

454
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,140
Dr. Yang just got a call from...
Oh, god. I'm sorry.

455
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,675
Oh, Shane, all my parts are covered.

456
00:18:14,709 --> 00:18:15,909
You can turn around.

457
00:18:15,944 --> 00:18:17,744
I'm fine looking at the wall.

458
00:18:17,779 --> 00:18:19,146
Oh! Um, organs are good.

459
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,248
- Let's go tell Samantha.
- She's lactating.

460
00:18:21,283 --> 00:18:23,584
I need 10 minutes.
I have 4 more ounces to go.

461
00:18:23,618 --> 00:18:25,353
Uh, okay. Page me when you're done.

462
00:18:25,387 --> 00:18:27,821
Oh, Dr. Torres is in surgery.

463
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:30,556
She can't get the kids
until 6:00 at the earliest.

464
00:18:30,591 --> 00:18:32,325
6:00 is too late for a tea party.

465
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,161
Tea time is at 4:00. Do you want
me to tell that to Dr. Torres?

466
00:18:35,196 --> 00:18:37,497
No, it's just that I promised.

467
00:18:37,531 --> 00:18:39,232
Just forget it. Forget it.

468
00:18:40,701 --> 00:18:43,436
There will be other tea parties.

469
00:18:43,471 --> 00:18:45,104
Well, this is how it starts.

470
00:18:45,138 --> 00:18:46,805
I make a promise. I break it.

471
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:49,008
Ten years later, I'm my mother,

472
00:18:49,042 --> 00:18:51,043
and Zola's snorting oxy behind the school.

473
00:18:51,077 --> 00:18:53,445
Nice.

474
00:18:57,183 --> 00:19:00,218
You know, it goes faster
when you do both sides

475
00:19:00,252 --> 00:19:02,720
at the same time. How about I quiz you?

476
00:19:02,754 --> 00:19:04,455
I thought you hated me.

477
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,957
I do.

478
00:19:06,992 --> 00:19:09,360
So hook up the pump before I change my mind.

479
00:19:10,795 --> 00:19:12,663
Dr. Robbins discovered the spinal A.V.M.

480
00:19:12,697 --> 00:19:14,798
when the patient was 12. It has since grown.

481
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:17,534
We are going to use a far
lateral retroperitoneal...

482
00:19:17,568 --> 00:19:18,801
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

483
00:19:18,836 --> 00:19:21,204
You suggested a posterior approach?

484
00:19:21,239 --> 00:19:22,539
Why go anteriorly?

485
00:19:22,573 --> 00:19:24,341
Did I say that?

486
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:27,044
Well, I also said the segway
was gonna hit big, but, uh...

487
00:19:27,078 --> 00:19:28,211
anyway, that...

488
00:19:28,246 --> 00:19:30,547
that theory has been elaborated.

489
00:19:30,581 --> 00:19:31,748
Excuse me.

490
00:19:31,782 --> 00:19:33,449
Sorry. Pardon me.

491
00:19:35,985 --> 00:19:37,653
Who knew Dr. Shepherd was such a big shot?

492
00:19:37,687 --> 00:19:39,121
What are you doing here?

493
00:19:39,156 --> 00:19:40,789
You told me to scrub in.

494
00:19:40,823 --> 00:19:43,659
The night of the gala?
At your house, remember?

495
00:19:43,693 --> 00:19:46,594
- Oh, yeah.
- That night was so fun.

496
00:19:46,741 --> 00:19:47,754
Yeah.

497
00:19:48,176 --> 00:19:50,260
Don't worry. I won't tell
anyone what happened.

498
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,300
Hey, um... It's a little tight in here.

499
00:19:52,334 --> 00:19:54,075
Uh, you could probably be more useful

500
00:19:54,175 --> 00:19:55,774
managing patients on the floor.

501
00:19:56,399 --> 00:19:57,906
Oh. Yeah.

502
00:19:57,941 --> 00:19:59,975
You're probably right.

503
00:20:08,216 --> 00:20:11,886
Okay, sweet girl, just one more.

504
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,254
That's it. Shh... Shh, shh.

505
00:20:18,961 --> 00:20:21,461
- Stop.
- Stop what?

506
00:20:21,495 --> 00:20:24,769
Doing that... making that dog face.

507
00:20:24,869 --> 00:20:27,203
It's puppy dog eyes,
and I'm not.

508
00:20:27,303 --> 00:20:28,513
These are my regular eyes.

509
00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:30,770
- What do you want?
- Your dad passed his stress test.

510
00:20:30,805 --> 00:20:33,838
- Yang told me to discharge him.
- Good.

511
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:37,142
Say it.

512
00:20:37,176 --> 00:20:40,312
I never had a father.

513
00:20:40,346 --> 00:20:43,681
I made up, like, 15 versions of one...

514
00:20:43,716 --> 00:20:45,650
a college professor who would read to me,

515
00:20:45,684 --> 00:20:47,586
a plumber who snuck me into movies.

516
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,088
Like, three doctors, one who would take me

517
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:52,056
to feed the ducks in Boston commons.

518
00:20:52,091 --> 00:20:53,957
I want to cry when I think about it,

519
00:20:53,992 --> 00:20:57,728
and I made it up.
I wanted one so badly.

520
00:20:57,762 --> 00:20:59,363
Alex, you have a father.

521
00:20:59,397 --> 00:21:02,399
I know, and he's a dirtbag,
and I didn't make that up.

522
00:21:02,434 --> 00:21:05,569
Just discharge him.

523
00:21:08,773 --> 00:21:12,442
Then, uh, he woke up,
and hornets were stinging him.

524
00:21:12,476 --> 00:21:14,844
Just on his penis? Accidentally?

525
00:21:14,878 --> 00:21:17,180
Um... yeah?

526
00:21:18,749 --> 00:21:22,885
Young man, did you put your
penis in a hornet's nest?

527
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:26,221
No.

528
00:21:26,256 --> 00:21:28,157
Maybe.

529
00:21:29,392 --> 00:21:30,826
Yes!

530
00:21:30,861 --> 00:21:33,996
Get another 50 of fentanyl for the pain.

531
00:21:34,031 --> 00:21:35,497
When there's no access for a catheter,

532
00:21:35,532 --> 00:21:37,499
you need to go directly into the bladder.

533
00:21:37,534 --> 00:21:40,069
Any intern should know that.

534
00:21:40,103 --> 00:21:41,336
Let's just pray we're not too late.

535
00:21:41,371 --> 00:21:42,403
What happens if we are?

536
00:21:42,437 --> 00:21:44,706
Hey, something just happened.

537
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,108
I-I feel like I don't have to pee anymore.

538
00:21:47,143 --> 00:21:49,243
That.

539
00:21:49,278 --> 00:21:51,379
The bladder bursts.
There's a moment of relief

540
00:21:51,413 --> 00:21:54,415
and then...

541
00:21:54,449 --> 00:21:56,551
Book an O.R.

542
00:21:56,585 --> 00:21:58,418
Get Dr. Hunt to extend me privileges.

543
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,694
I am going to the O.R.

544
00:22:09,823 --> 00:22:11,242
One of your fine young residents

545
00:22:11,277 --> 00:22:12,977
just let a man's bladder explode.

546
00:22:13,012 --> 00:22:14,579
Which resident?

547
00:22:14,614 --> 00:22:15,714
The one who was so busy shaking her tail

548
00:22:15,748 --> 00:22:17,048
in front of my son.

549
00:22:17,082 --> 00:22:19,518
- Oh, Edwards isn't dumb.
- You're right.

550
00:22:19,552 --> 00:22:21,786
She's strategic. Jackson is dumb.

551
00:22:21,886 --> 00:22:22,650
Catherine...

552
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:26,088
I'm going to go and
salvage this patient's manhood.

553
00:22:26,124 --> 00:22:27,257
But when I come back,

554
00:22:27,292 --> 00:22:28,992
I want to have a serious
conversation with you

555
00:22:29,027 --> 00:22:31,695
about coming home with me.

556
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:33,931
Sorry. I came to see if
your drain output picked up

557
00:22:33,965 --> 00:22:35,265
after we stripped it, but...

558
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,301
I can come back later.

559
00:22:38,335 --> 00:22:40,169
You're not progressing very quickly here.

560
00:22:40,203 --> 00:22:42,439
They're all in love with you,
and afraid of you.

561
00:22:42,473 --> 00:22:45,308
So they're coddling you. It's very sweet,

562
00:22:45,342 --> 00:22:49,045
but ultimately a disservice.
You need to push yourself.

563
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:50,914
You need someone to push you.

564
00:22:50,948 --> 00:22:53,415
This is a long road,
and the slower you go down it,

565
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:56,284
the poorer your chances are.

566
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:58,119
I love you,

567
00:22:58,154 --> 00:23:00,322
but I will not coddle you.

568
00:23:00,356 --> 00:23:02,057
I never learned how.

569
00:23:04,727 --> 00:23:05,761
Come here.

570
00:23:10,398 --> 00:23:13,233
Just think about it. Please?

571
00:23:16,805 --> 00:23:19,073
You're a goddess.

572
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:21,542
I know.

573
00:23:21,577 --> 00:23:23,478
- This is Grey.
- Dr. Grey...

574
00:23:23,512 --> 00:23:25,345
It's Karen at the day care center.

575
00:23:25,379 --> 00:23:26,980
Zola took a spill off the slide,

576
00:23:27,014 --> 00:23:29,082
and she nicked the side of her head.

577
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:32,151
- She's probably going to need a few stitches.
- Is she able to stand?

578
00:23:32,186 --> 00:23:33,954
- Did she ever lose consciousness?
- What happened?

579
00:23:33,988 --> 00:23:35,054
- I'm a teacher...
- She cut her head open.

580
00:23:35,089 --> 00:23:37,290
- Well, go. I'll tell Yang.
- Okay.

581
00:23:37,324 --> 00:23:39,325
So tell Cristina to go ahead and
talk to Samantha without me,

582
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,961
- and I will meet her in the O.R.
- Okay.

583
00:23:41,995 --> 00:23:43,295
Poor baby.

584
00:23:43,329 --> 00:23:45,698
All right. I got a quick consult

585
00:23:45,732 --> 00:23:47,299
on a Stevens Johnson syndrome,

586
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:48,767
and then I'll be right in to check in on

587
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,603
my mother's penis.

588
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:53,973
I mean, the patient's penis that
my mom asked me to consult on.

589
00:23:54,007 --> 00:23:56,274
Why couldn't she have been a hand specialist

590
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:57,509
or ears or something?

591
00:23:57,543 --> 00:23:59,310
Does it really have to be
you and me and your mom

592
00:23:59,344 --> 00:24:01,312
all staring at a penis?

593
00:24:01,346 --> 00:24:02,514
It is not that loaded for her.

594
00:24:02,548 --> 00:24:04,181
Okay, it's her work. She loves it.

595
00:24:04,216 --> 00:24:05,783
Just ask her questions and make it medical.

596
00:24:05,818 --> 00:24:07,819
She'll probably forget about me and you.

597
00:24:07,853 --> 00:24:09,453
Honestly, she probably already forgot.

598
00:24:09,488 --> 00:24:11,789
How nice to see the two
of you together again,

599
00:24:11,824 --> 00:24:14,124
and all dressed this time.

600
00:24:21,533 --> 00:24:24,902
I did it... 'cause I'm amazing.

601
00:24:24,936 --> 00:24:26,336
Wait. What are you doing?

602
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,470
I'm discharged, right?

603
00:24:27,505 --> 00:24:29,839
Oh, no. We're keeping you here overnight

604
00:24:29,873 --> 00:24:32,642
'cause I got you 28 days at Somerville

605
00:24:32,676 --> 00:24:35,377
starting tomorrow. It's a good center.

606
00:24:35,412 --> 00:24:37,246
Strong program, great people,

607
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,181
and they said that they would
waive the fees for you.

608
00:24:39,215 --> 00:24:42,518
I appreciate it. Mm-hmm.

609
00:24:42,553 --> 00:24:44,219
- That's all right.
- It's all set up.

610
00:24:44,254 --> 00:24:45,720
And they're gonna come get you tomorrow...

611
00:24:45,755 --> 00:24:48,623
Why are you doing this?
What is your deal here?

612
00:24:48,658 --> 00:24:49,858
I mean, you pull your strings

613
00:24:49,892 --> 00:24:51,993
for every itinerate junkie
musician that shows up?

614
00:24:52,028 --> 00:24:53,728
You said that you would go if I set it up.

615
00:24:53,763 --> 00:24:56,131
- You said that you would go.
- No, see, I never said that.

616
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:59,134
That's against my policy.
That's how you screw up.

617
00:24:59,169 --> 00:25:00,635
You tell someone you're gonna do something,

618
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:02,836
you set 'em up for disappointment.

619
00:25:04,373 --> 00:25:06,441
That's how you lose your home...

620
00:25:06,475 --> 00:25:09,243
your family. Make your children hate you.

621
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:12,413
Look, you're a sweet kid,
and I don't even know you.

622
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:15,516
But I don't want to let you down, too.

623
00:25:15,551 --> 00:25:18,051
All right?

624
00:25:18,086 --> 00:25:19,852
'Cause you'd never let
me hear the end of it,

625
00:25:19,887 --> 00:25:21,688
you damn nag.

626
00:25:23,924 --> 00:25:26,359
Jimmy, if you keep going the
way that you are going...

627
00:25:26,394 --> 00:25:28,361
I appreciate your concern...

628
00:25:29,964 --> 00:25:31,631
more than I can say.

629
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:36,769
Just take care now.

630
00:25:45,445 --> 00:25:47,013
You can help.

631
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:49,615
- Oh, my god.
- He's leaving, and he's miserable,

632
00:25:49,649 --> 00:25:51,617
and he's full of regret about you.

633
00:25:51,651 --> 00:25:53,652
And you're angry.
And you've always been angry.

634
00:25:53,686 --> 00:25:55,253
And I think this could help you, too.

635
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:56,955
And I think it's your last chance

636
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:58,824
because he's gonna go and use again,

637
00:25:58,858 --> 00:26:02,060
- and he's gonna die.
- Look, don't talk to me about this again.

638
00:26:02,095 --> 00:26:04,229
All right? Ever.

639
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:13,203
- Oh, how's Zola?
- Oh, she'll be fine.

640
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,906
Once Grey gets down there,
she'll stitch her up,

641
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:18,308
and be back in time to scrub in.

642
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:20,911
It's happening again!

643
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:24,014
Oh, she's desatting.

644
00:26:24,048 --> 00:26:25,448
Uh, I'm gonna intubate.

645
00:26:25,482 --> 00:26:28,284
Push 5 of versed and 100 of succinylcholine.

646
00:26:28,318 --> 00:26:31,054
- What happened?
- She's gone into heart failure again.

647
00:26:31,088 --> 00:26:32,455
Check on the organs and book an O.R.

648
00:26:32,489 --> 00:26:34,157
We're bring her down as
soon as she's intubated.

649
00:26:48,984 --> 00:26:52,435
Okay, got that closed up.

650
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:55,705
Now let me see. Did I miss anything else?

651
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,341
I don't see anything.

652
00:26:57,375 --> 00:26:58,942
That's what's called

653
00:26:58,977 --> 00:27:01,410
a rhetorical question, my dear.

654
00:27:01,444 --> 00:27:04,770
All right, let's take a look
at this penis, shall we?

655
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:05,713
Mm.

656
00:27:07,017 --> 00:27:10,419
Uh, Dr. Avery, can you elaborate

657
00:27:10,453 --> 00:27:12,321
on some of your more interesting cases?

658
00:27:12,356 --> 00:27:14,323
I'm fascinated by all things penile.

659
00:27:14,358 --> 00:27:17,392
Yes, I saw evidence of
that earlier this morning.

660
00:27:17,426 --> 00:27:20,061
How's it looking, dear?

661
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:22,264
Well, it's possible
he's gonna need a skin graft,

662
00:27:22,298 --> 00:27:24,032
- but nothing I can't fix.
- Mm-hmm.

663
00:27:24,066 --> 00:27:26,067
Yeah, he'll be able to stick
it in a hornet's nest,

664
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:29,170
an ant hill, a tarantula's...
wherever they live.

665
00:27:29,205 --> 00:27:31,839
Well, I find that men
often put their penises

666
00:27:31,874 --> 00:27:33,874
in places that they don't belong.

667
00:27:33,909 --> 00:27:36,343
Mm-hmm.

668
00:27:36,378 --> 00:27:37,811
Suction, dear, come on.

669
00:27:40,715 --> 00:27:44,151
Okay, supergirl.

670
00:27:44,185 --> 00:27:45,485
That's the only ouch-y part.

671
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,721
Now you're not gonna feel anything at all.

672
00:27:47,755 --> 00:27:50,823
You are so brave. I'm so proud of you.

673
00:27:52,026 --> 00:27:54,593
My patient's going into the O.R.

674
00:27:54,628 --> 00:27:55,895
- When?
- Right now.

675
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:57,964
It wasn't supposed to be
for another hour at least.

676
00:27:57,998 --> 00:27:59,065
Well, go ahead. Uh...

677
00:27:59,099 --> 00:28:00,233
I'll have Jenna come in and hold her.

678
00:28:00,267 --> 00:28:01,734
Doesn't that sound

679
00:28:01,768 --> 00:28:04,503
a little Ellis Grey to you...
to leave my kid to go to surgery

680
00:28:04,538 --> 00:28:06,471
- while she's getting stitches?
- You're a good mom, Mer.

681
00:28:06,505 --> 00:28:07,639
Take it from me. I had crap parents.

682
00:28:07,673 --> 00:28:09,141
I know the difference.

683
00:28:09,175 --> 00:28:11,776
Besides, she's not gonna be alone.
She's gonna be with me,

684
00:28:11,811 --> 00:28:13,878
who she loves more than her own parents.

685
00:28:17,016 --> 00:28:18,951
I can't believe I'm doing this.

686
00:28:18,985 --> 00:28:20,985
Yeah. Can you send Jenna in here?

687
00:28:21,019 --> 00:28:22,519
Look, don't cry, or she will.

688
00:28:25,757 --> 00:28:27,458
The general surgeons weren't able to repair

689
00:28:27,492 --> 00:28:31,228
- your sister's kidney, so... we're gonna...
- Let's just cut to the chase.

690
00:28:31,263 --> 00:28:34,098
Eventually, she's going to need a kidney.

691
00:28:34,132 --> 00:28:35,266
Right?

692
00:28:38,869 --> 00:28:40,903
Okay.

693
00:28:40,938 --> 00:28:43,373
Well, here I am.

694
00:28:43,407 --> 00:28:46,642
Open the toolbox. Take whatever she needs.

695
00:28:48,579 --> 00:28:51,747
Hey, look, this doesn't
have to happen right now.

696
00:28:51,782 --> 00:28:55,150
Okay, sh-she'll be on dialysis
until we find a donor.

697
00:28:55,185 --> 00:28:59,621
You don't need to be spare
parts for your sister anymore.

698
00:29:02,758 --> 00:29:06,195
Here's what I need.

699
00:29:06,229 --> 00:29:08,964
I need a boyfriend...

700
00:29:08,998 --> 00:29:11,032
and a job...

701
00:29:11,066 --> 00:29:15,069
and a Caribbean cruise...

702
00:29:15,104 --> 00:29:17,538
and I would like to learn to ride a bike,

703
00:29:17,572 --> 00:29:19,673
because I never learned to
ride one when I was little.

704
00:29:19,708 --> 00:29:20,808
I couldn't get injured

705
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,610
'cause Reese might need some body part.

706
00:29:22,644 --> 00:29:24,479
And I'd love to not be

707
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:27,881
spare parts for my sister anymore,

708
00:29:27,915 --> 00:29:29,249
but can I do that?

709
00:29:29,283 --> 00:29:30,683
Can I say no?

710
00:29:30,718 --> 00:29:33,520
Yes, you can say no. It's your life.

711
00:29:33,554 --> 00:29:36,256
You know, you should ride that bike.

712
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:39,026
Go on that cruise. Get a boyfriend.

713
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:42,061
Dance in your underwear.

714
00:29:42,095 --> 00:29:43,396
Yeah, you can say no.

715
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:46,399
- I can say no.
- Yeah, it feels good, right?

716
00:29:46,433 --> 00:29:48,534
I can say no!

717
00:29:48,568 --> 00:29:50,236
You can say no!

718
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,504
No! No! No!

719
00:29:51,538 --> 00:29:53,872
- No!
- No! No! No!

720
00:30:00,446 --> 00:30:03,014
Oh, sweetie.

721
00:30:03,049 --> 00:30:06,051
I'm his wife. I was out of town.

722
00:30:06,085 --> 00:30:10,055
- What happened?
- Well, he... came in with quite a few stings

723
00:30:10,089 --> 00:30:13,223
- in his groin area. And...
- Oh, no.

724
00:30:13,258 --> 00:30:14,758
He didn't.

725
00:30:14,792 --> 00:30:18,062
He stuck his penis in that
hornet's nest, didn't he?

726
00:30:18,096 --> 00:30:20,330
You knew?

727
00:30:20,365 --> 00:30:23,700
- How?
- I saw a nest on the eaves as I left.

728
00:30:23,734 --> 00:30:25,202
I knew I should have had it removed.

729
00:30:25,236 --> 00:30:28,004
So... this is something he's done before?

730
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:31,140
He's someone who...

731
00:30:31,175 --> 00:30:34,377
likes a little pain with his pleasure.

732
00:30:34,411 --> 00:30:36,612
Any kind of sting, really.

733
00:30:36,646 --> 00:30:39,449
Bee, ant...

734
00:30:39,483 --> 00:30:41,417
I'm sure he was ashamed.

735
00:30:41,452 --> 00:30:43,453
That's why it took him so long to come in.

736
00:30:43,487 --> 00:30:45,887
I don't understand it either.

737
00:30:45,921 --> 00:30:49,224
But it's just one thing.

738
00:30:49,258 --> 00:30:52,427
There are 500 things about him...

739
00:30:52,462 --> 00:30:55,029
that are so much more interesting.

740
00:30:55,064 --> 00:30:57,832
That is not possible.

741
00:31:02,604 --> 00:31:04,071
Whew! I'm here.

742
00:31:05,407 --> 00:31:08,275
- What's she doing here?
- She's doing the liver.

743
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:10,010
I'm doing the liver.

744
00:31:10,044 --> 00:31:11,512
She needed two staples. I actually left her

745
00:31:11,546 --> 00:31:14,047
- in the hands of Jenna... that nurse that...
- I don't care about Zola.

746
00:31:14,082 --> 00:31:15,583
I'm thinking about the patient.

747
00:31:15,617 --> 00:31:18,118
- Whoa, dial it back for a second.
- Does she have a concussion?

748
00:31:18,152 --> 00:31:20,052
- No, she's fine.
- Are you?

749
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:21,554
You're gonna be worried about that

750
00:31:21,589 --> 00:31:24,491
and a hundred other things
besides my patient and my liver.

751
00:31:24,525 --> 00:31:26,659
She is my patient,

752
00:31:26,693 --> 00:31:28,261
and she was my patient before...

753
00:31:28,295 --> 00:31:29,962
Did you finish reading
the article on performing

754
00:31:29,997 --> 00:31:32,298
simultaneous transplants
completely under C.P.B.?

755
00:31:35,735 --> 00:31:37,369
Dr. Bailey knows the procedure.

756
00:31:37,403 --> 00:31:39,771
Dr. Bailey is scrubbing
in on my patient.

757
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:45,977
Sorry.

758
00:31:58,382 --> 00:32:00,616
Probably should have checked back earlier.

759
00:32:00,651 --> 00:32:04,352
Your... white blood cell count is elevated.

760
00:32:04,387 --> 00:32:05,853
I'd like to start you on antibiotics.

761
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,855
Why do I need antibiotics?

762
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:10,057
Because there's a left shift?

763
00:32:10,092 --> 00:32:12,093
You need to examine me

764
00:32:12,127 --> 00:32:15,263
to find out what's causing the elevation.

765
00:32:19,133 --> 00:32:20,701
Murphy...

766
00:32:20,735 --> 00:32:22,603
I don't want to be coddled
or pussy-footed around.

767
00:32:22,637 --> 00:32:24,405
No offense. It makes you a bad doctor

768
00:32:24,439 --> 00:32:27,541
and me a sicker patient. So buck up,

769
00:32:27,575 --> 00:32:31,412
lift my gown and give me
a proper hands-on exam.

770
00:32:31,446 --> 00:32:33,514
Yes, sir.

771
00:32:42,022 --> 00:32:43,488
It... feels distended.

772
00:32:43,523 --> 00:32:45,624
Okay, what does that tell you?

773
00:32:45,658 --> 00:32:47,960
- There could be fluid buildup.
- Okay.

774
00:32:47,994 --> 00:32:49,394
You're checking the drain?

775
00:32:49,429 --> 00:32:50,930
There's no output.

776
00:32:50,964 --> 00:32:53,398
Okay, what else?

777
00:32:53,433 --> 00:32:56,968
You have epigastric tenderness,
increased W.B.C.,

778
00:32:57,002 --> 00:32:58,402
and little to no drain output,

779
00:32:58,437 --> 00:33:00,939
which means you have a...

780
00:33:00,973 --> 00:33:03,208
- symptomatic pancreatic leak.
- Okay.

781
00:33:03,242 --> 00:33:05,276
Which also means
I'm in a great deal of pain.

782
00:33:05,311 --> 00:33:07,312
Now you need to try and unclog the drain

783
00:33:07,346 --> 00:33:09,413
with a Fogarty catheter so
this doesn't happen again!

784
00:33:09,448 --> 00:33:11,515
God.

785
00:33:14,452 --> 00:33:16,954
There's the bossy Richard I know and love.

786
00:33:16,988 --> 00:33:21,058
They're gonna learn
how to look me in the eye

787
00:33:21,092 --> 00:33:22,659
and explain to me what they're doing

788
00:33:22,693 --> 00:33:23,894
so I understand.

789
00:33:23,928 --> 00:33:26,965
When I ask a question,
they're going to answer it.

790
00:33:27,065 --> 00:33:30,795
They're gonna figure out why
my pancreas still requires a drain.

791
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,801
So I... take it

792
00:33:32,836 --> 00:33:34,803
you're not coming home with me.

793
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,474
These fools need me, Catherine.

794
00:33:38,508 --> 00:33:40,442
Well, what if I need you, too?

795
00:33:42,498 --> 00:33:43,379
Come here.

796
00:33:50,152 --> 00:33:52,420
You got me.

797
00:33:52,454 --> 00:33:54,655
I'm right here.

798
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:56,657
Hey, going back to the tribe?

799
00:33:56,692 --> 00:33:58,493
After I grab Sofia. How about you?

800
00:33:58,527 --> 00:33:59,494
Seeing your not-girlfriend?

801
00:33:59,528 --> 00:34:01,061
That was the plan,

802
00:34:01,096 --> 00:34:03,597
but I'm going to talk to
the hang glider's sister.

803
00:34:03,631 --> 00:34:06,800
She decided to donate a kidney after all.

804
00:34:36,162 --> 00:34:38,663
Take it easy, pal.

805
00:34:43,403 --> 00:34:44,569
How'd it go?

806
00:34:47,573 --> 00:34:49,073
Her initial labs look good.

807
00:34:49,107 --> 00:34:51,275
She's, uh, headed down to the cardiac I.C.U.

808
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:53,444
- if you want...
- You stole that surgery from me.

809
00:34:53,478 --> 00:34:56,447
I'm sorry.

810
00:34:56,481 --> 00:34:59,183
I really wish you could
have been in there with me.

811
00:34:59,217 --> 00:35:01,986
I worked my ass off to
do that surgery with you,

812
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:04,021
and you stole it from me. That was low...

813
00:35:04,056 --> 00:35:06,423
Meredith, you were unprepared,
you were unfocused,

814
00:35:06,457 --> 00:35:07,857
and you were late.

815
00:35:07,891 --> 00:35:09,392
I didn't steal that surgery from you.

816
00:35:09,427 --> 00:35:10,961
I rescued that surgery from you.

817
00:35:10,995 --> 00:35:12,395
- Oh, I...
- Because you couldn't do it.

818
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:14,965
I understand that you believe
you are god's gift to medicine,

819
00:35:14,999 --> 00:35:17,100
but I am every bit as talented and competent

820
00:35:17,134 --> 00:35:18,668
a surgeon as you are.

821
00:35:18,702 --> 00:35:21,870
No... you're not.

822
00:35:21,904 --> 00:35:25,007
I'm sorry...

823
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:26,875
but you're not.

824
00:35:26,909 --> 00:35:29,178
And that's...

825
00:35:29,212 --> 00:35:30,412
that's okay.

826
00:35:30,447 --> 00:35:32,247
You have different priorities now.

827
00:35:32,282 --> 00:35:34,116
You cut back on your clinical hours,

828
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,517
you log in less time in the O.R.

829
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:38,552
I mean, you don't do research, and I get it.

830
00:35:38,587 --> 00:35:41,189
I mean, you have Zola and baby Bailey, and...

831
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:43,324
and you want to be a good mom.

832
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:44,725
I don't believe you.

833
00:35:44,759 --> 00:35:47,661
You are saying that I can't
be a good surgeon and a mom.

834
00:35:47,696 --> 00:35:49,263
Of course not. Bailey is a mom, and she...

835
00:35:49,298 --> 00:35:51,432
I mean, she was fantastic in there today.

836
00:35:51,467 --> 00:35:53,166
- Then what are you saying?
- I'm saying...

837
00:35:54,969 --> 00:35:58,438
I'm s... Okay. Bailey never let up.

838
00:35:58,473 --> 00:36:00,007
Okay, she, like, lives here.

839
00:36:00,041 --> 00:36:01,708
Callie never let up.

840
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:04,511
Ellis Grey never let up.

841
00:36:04,545 --> 00:36:07,180
And I know you don't want to be your mother.

842
00:36:07,215 --> 00:36:08,482
I'm saying...

843
00:36:10,117 --> 00:36:11,583
I'm saying...

844
00:36:11,618 --> 00:36:13,519
you and I started running down the same road

845
00:36:13,553 --> 00:36:14,620
at the same time,

846
00:36:14,654 --> 00:36:17,456
and at a certain point you let up.

847
00:36:17,491 --> 00:36:19,591
You slowed down.

848
00:36:19,626 --> 00:36:21,994
And don't say that I don't
support that, because I do.

849
00:36:22,029 --> 00:36:24,930
You made your choices,
and they are valid choices.

850
00:36:24,964 --> 00:36:27,798
But don't pretend they
don't affect your skills.

851
00:36:27,833 --> 00:36:32,137
You... are a very good surgeon. It's...

852
00:36:32,171 --> 00:36:35,407
We're in different places now.

853
00:36:35,441 --> 00:36:37,409
And that's...

854
00:36:37,443 --> 00:36:39,144
okay.

855
00:36:47,952 --> 00:36:50,921
I mean, they were huge.
They were hard to hold.

856
00:36:50,955 --> 00:36:52,222
Yeah?

857
00:36:52,257 --> 00:36:53,390
Yeah, they kind of hooked like that.

858
00:36:53,425 --> 00:36:54,624
- You see those people down there?
- Mm-hmm.

859
00:36:54,659 --> 00:36:56,527
Those are the top 12
neurosurgeons in the world,

860
00:36:56,561 --> 00:36:57,693
- and they need a drink.
- You got it.

861
00:37:01,565 --> 00:37:03,332
Hey.

862
00:37:03,367 --> 00:37:06,001
I am going to need my place back.

863
00:37:06,036 --> 00:37:07,903
Look, I feel bad about kicking you out,

864
00:37:07,938 --> 00:37:10,239
but I need to stop taking
care of other people.

865
00:37:10,274 --> 00:37:12,942
I took care of you for a year.

866
00:37:12,976 --> 00:37:15,210
I picked you up off the bathroom floor.

867
00:37:15,244 --> 00:37:17,512
I took your abuse.

868
00:37:17,547 --> 00:37:19,581
But you're not sick anymore.

869
00:37:19,615 --> 00:37:20,882
Now you're just someone who cheated,

870
00:37:20,916 --> 00:37:22,917
and you did that to yourself. So...

871
00:37:22,952 --> 00:37:24,819
I'm sorry, but I need my life back.

872
00:37:24,853 --> 00:37:26,988
I need me back, and I need to do it tonight,

873
00:37:27,022 --> 00:37:28,490
or I'm afraid I'll change my mind.

874
00:37:28,524 --> 00:37:30,357
So...

875
00:37:30,392 --> 00:37:31,658
I will have an intern pack up your stuff

876
00:37:31,693 --> 00:37:34,628
and bring it to the hospital tomorrow.

877
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:41,502
You can stay at my place.

878
00:37:44,272 --> 00:37:45,472
Okay, you know what?

879
00:37:45,506 --> 00:37:47,240
Okay. Just... just tell me,

880
00:37:47,274 --> 00:37:48,741
what did I do? What did we do?

881
00:37:48,775 --> 00:37:51,578
'Cause clearly something
happened after the gala,

882
00:37:51,612 --> 00:37:54,847
and whatever it was... I'm sorry, I don't...

883
00:37:54,881 --> 00:37:56,882
Oh, my god.

884
00:37:56,917 --> 00:37:58,151
I can't believe you don't remember.

885
00:37:58,185 --> 00:38:01,786
Well, I was drunk, and you're pretty...

886
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,922
- We hung out.
- Oh.

887
00:38:03,956 --> 00:38:05,157
After I put you in the cab,

888
00:38:05,191 --> 00:38:06,791
I called to see if you
and Kepner made it home.

889
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,860
And you didn't answer, so I went to check.

890
00:38:08,894 --> 00:38:10,729
And good thing, because you were passed out

891
00:38:10,763 --> 00:38:12,131
- on the hallway floor.
- Oh.

892
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:13,632
I helped you inside...

893
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,967
and you insisted on having a dance party.

894
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:18,902
We made the most amazing
grilled cheese sandwiches

895
00:38:18,937 --> 00:38:21,139
and ate them while we watched the films

896
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:24,008
of Dr. Shepherd doing the spinal A.V.M....

897
00:38:24,042 --> 00:38:25,209
which he did today...

898
00:38:25,244 --> 00:38:27,411
which is when you asked me to be there.

899
00:38:27,446 --> 00:38:30,214
Oh.

900
00:38:30,249 --> 00:38:32,016
It was the first time I felt like

901
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:34,551
I found someone around here who got me.

902
00:38:36,454 --> 00:38:38,355
Do you really not remember any of it?

903
00:38:38,389 --> 00:38:41,558
I vaguely remember the grilled cheese.

904
00:38:45,429 --> 00:38:48,598
Let's go back to the part
where you said I was pretty.

905
00:38:51,535 --> 00:38:53,235
That part?

906
00:39:05,847 --> 00:39:07,948
Excuse me, Dr. Avery. Do you have a minute?

907
00:39:07,983 --> 00:39:12,287
I'm meeting my son, Edwards.
It's been a long day.

908
00:39:12,321 --> 00:39:13,688
I just think that we probably

909
00:39:13,722 --> 00:39:14,789
got off on the wrong foot.

910
00:39:14,823 --> 00:39:16,757
Your feet were not the issue, dear.

911
00:39:16,792 --> 00:39:18,893
- I know how it looked.
- I'm quite sure you don't.

912
00:39:18,927 --> 00:39:20,261
No, I really do.

913
00:39:20,296 --> 00:39:22,028
I was having a quickie with
your son in the on-call room.

914
00:39:22,063 --> 00:39:24,731
And it suggests I have no self respect.

915
00:39:24,765 --> 00:39:28,202
I suggests that I,
like much of my generation,

916
00:39:28,236 --> 00:39:30,537
don't understand that where
we choose to have sex

917
00:39:30,572 --> 00:39:32,606
says a lot about what we think of ourselves.

918
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,741
And a lot of the work
you did to break down barriers

919
00:39:34,775 --> 00:39:36,810
for women... and in particular,
women of color...

920
00:39:36,844 --> 00:39:38,244
was a whole lot of wasted effort.

921
00:39:38,278 --> 00:39:41,614
Mm.

922
00:39:41,648 --> 00:39:44,350
I picked a shirt to wear today...

923
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:46,985
because I knew I'd be meeting you...

924
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,921
A really respectable one.

925
00:39:48,955 --> 00:39:53,991
Meeting Jacskon's mother
meant something to me.

926
00:39:54,026 --> 00:39:55,227
I care about him.

927
00:39:55,261 --> 00:39:57,929
And the shirt coming off
in the on-call room...

928
00:39:57,963 --> 00:39:59,997
that was really, like, a joke about people

929
00:40:00,032 --> 00:40:01,399
who have sex in on-call rooms.

930
00:40:01,434 --> 00:40:04,102
And that's the only thing
you're gonna think of

931
00:40:04,136 --> 00:40:06,338
when you think of me now.

932
00:40:06,372 --> 00:40:08,406
There are 500 other things about me

933
00:40:08,441 --> 00:40:10,841
that are so much more interesting than that.

934
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:12,576
Well, I will also think about the fact

935
00:40:12,611 --> 00:40:14,077
that you didn't put in a catheter

936
00:40:14,112 --> 00:40:16,113
- until the man's bladder...
- Okay.

937
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:18,014
In all fairness, I wasn't
getting all the information

938
00:40:18,049 --> 00:40:20,317
- I needed to diagnose.
- When in doubt,

939
00:40:20,352 --> 00:40:22,419
assume they put it someplace unimaginable

940
00:40:22,454 --> 00:40:23,954
and move on.

941
00:40:26,523 --> 00:40:29,692
Oh, hey, um... I was just leaving.

942
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:33,129
Well, what's your hurry?
I'm buying.

943
00:40:40,003 --> 00:40:41,803
So...

944
00:40:44,307 --> 00:40:46,808
Sleep tight.

945
00:40:48,244 --> 00:40:51,012
What if your focus splits?

946
00:40:51,046 --> 00:40:53,782
What if you can't be all in?

947
00:40:56,852 --> 00:40:59,287
Are you left with nothing at all?

948
00:41:14,435 --> 00:41:17,771
Maybe you just need to find
a different path.

949
00:41:25,813 --> 00:41:28,748
Hey! How's Zola?

950
00:41:28,783 --> 00:41:31,016
Karev filled me in.
Said she was a real champ.

951
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:36,221
She didn't get her princess tea party.

952
00:41:37,524 --> 00:41:38,990
Wait. I thought Callie was gonna do that.

953
00:41:39,025 --> 00:41:40,426
Callie has moved out,

954
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,027
and she was supposed to
do the food shopping.

955
00:41:42,061 --> 00:41:43,895
So now there's no food.

956
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:45,163
Zola has two stitches in her head

957
00:41:45,198 --> 00:41:47,498
and had cereal for dinner,
and the house is a mess

958
00:41:47,533 --> 00:41:49,200
because I couldn't get the baby to sleep.

959
00:41:49,234 --> 00:41:50,935
And she didn't get her princess tea party.

960
00:41:50,969 --> 00:41:53,103
Why are you yelling at me?
I had a big surgery.

961
00:41:53,138 --> 00:41:54,171
So did I!

962
00:41:54,206 --> 00:41:56,240
But you didn't answer your phone.

963
00:41:56,274 --> 00:41:58,843
She cut her head,
and you didn't answer your phone.

964
00:41:58,877 --> 00:42:01,212
So I had to go comfort her, which means that

965
00:42:01,246 --> 00:42:03,112
I didn't get to
do my surgery...

966
00:42:03,147 --> 00:42:06,750
a heart/liver transplant.
Those never happen,

967
00:42:06,784 --> 00:42:08,885
and I didn't get to do it.

968
00:42:08,919 --> 00:42:11,788
- I'm sorry, but that is not my fault.
- It is your fault

969
00:42:11,823 --> 00:42:14,190
- Because you didn't answer your phone!
- I was in a surgery.

970
00:42:14,225 --> 00:42:16,259
I shouldn't have to choose
between being a good mother

971
00:42:16,293 --> 00:42:18,828
- and being a good surgeon.
- I never asked you to do that.

972
00:42:18,862 --> 00:42:20,195
Never have I asked you to do that.

973
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:22,431
Here's what's horrifying...

974
00:42:22,466 --> 00:42:24,567
what if you can't give
a hundred percent?

975
00:42:27,371 --> 00:42:28,637
Maybe you just need to go
back to the beginning...

976
00:42:30,139 --> 00:42:32,975
And start all over again.
