00:00:01,471 --> 00:00:02,672
how am I supposed to walk

2
00:00:02,739 --> 00:00:03,773
Into that meeting with no presentation?

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,107
How the hell did you screw this up?

4
00:00:05,175 --> 00:00:06,242
it wasn't me.

5
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:07,243
she's lying.

6
00:00:07,311 --> 00:00:08,544
no, we agreed.

7
00:00:08,612 --> 00:00:09,779
Her team had all the financials.

8
00:00:09,846 --> 00:00:11,547
And we were swamped modeling them.

9
00:00:11,615 --> 00:00:13,716
That's why we agreed that
you would do the slides.

10
00:00:13,784 --> 00:00:14,984
Well, one of you screwed up,

11
00:00:15,052 --> 00:00:16,118
<i>So please try to figure it out.</i>

12
00:00:16,186 --> 00:00:17,853
'cause when the client dumps me,

13
00:00:17,921 --> 00:00:19,488
I need to know who to fire.

14
00:00:19,556 --> 00:00:21,390
Look, I confirmed it in an email. Hold on.

15
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:22,925
Here.

16
00:00:27,164 --> 00:00:28,664
<i>She did tell you about it, russ.</i>

17
00:00:28,732 --> 00:00:29,932
What the hell?

18
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:37,940
I never got this.

19
00:00:38,008 --> 00:00:39,375
Russ, are you okay?

20
00:00:41,511 --> 00:00:44,313
Are you drunk? I'm not drunk.

21
00:00:44,381 --> 00:00:45,615
Oh! Ah!

22
00:00:50,687 --> 00:00:52,021
I'm not drunk.

23
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,462
I had no idea he was drinking again.

24
00:00:59,529 --> 00:01:01,330
Well, you should have.

25
00:01:01,398 --> 00:01:02,565
Give me five minutes.

26
00:01:02,633 --> 00:01:03,899
I'll go to the business center

27
00:01:03,967 --> 00:01:05,534
And print the graphs directly
from the spreadsheets.

28
00:01:05,602 --> 00:01:08,304
Run. And bring me some paper towels.

29
00:01:08,372 --> 00:01:10,973
Ah! Ow!

30
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,842
<i>Ah! What?</i>

31
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:16,045
Ah! Oh, it hurts.

32
00:01:16,113 --> 00:01:17,947
<i>Don't tell me you were drinking too.</i>

33
00:01:17,948 --> 00:01:18,948
No.

34
00:01:19,949 --> 00:01:21,649
My ears. Oh my God.

35
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,050
Oh.

36
00:01:23,651 --> 00:01:25,151
Oh.

37
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:31,152

âTª âTª

41
00:01:56,756 --> 00:01:58,356
27 year old female

42
00:01:58,357 --> 00:02:00,357
intense, intermittent ear pains

43
00:02:00,358 --> 00:02:01,358
saw six doctors.

44
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:03,359
Tell her to stop lurking in the front row.

45
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,460
If she wants to hit on musicians

46
00:02:04,461 --> 00:02:05,961
that's what four buses are for.

47
00:02:06,362 --> 00:02:07,362
Next.

48
00:02:07,363 --> 00:02:09,263
If I ask why were in Wilson's office

49
00:02:09,264 --> 00:02:11,564
is there any chance I'll
get a straight answer?

50
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:12,565
Try it. Try it.

51
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:14,766
14 year old boy

52
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:17,067
joint pain and excess hair growth.

53
00:02:17,068 --> 00:02:19,368
Tell him to masturbate,
no more than 3 times daily.

54
00:02:19,869 --> 00:02:20,869
With meals.

55
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,070
Next.

56
00:02:22,071 --> 00:02:26,071
Did I mention that the 27
year old female is really hot.

57
00:02:26,072 --> 00:02:29,472
And her husband is really not wild yet.

58
00:02:29,473 --> 00:02:30,173
He's rich.

59
00:02:30,174 --> 00:02:31,374
Not unless social workers

60
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:33,575
have begun pulling in
the big money recently.

61
00:02:36,034 --> 00:02:37,434
Gimme...

62
00:02:37,502 --> 00:02:39,403
You're taking the case because she's hot?

63
00:02:39,471 --> 00:02:41,372
No, that would be an accident of genetics.

64
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:44,074
It's because she's hot
and her husband is ugly.

65
00:02:44,142 --> 00:02:45,776
It's a fascinating window into the mysteries

66
00:02:45,844 --> 00:02:46,977
Of human psychology.

67
00:02:47,045 --> 00:02:49,580
<i>Also, she's really hot. Or...</i>

68
00:02:49,648 --> 00:02:51,382
She, you know, loves her husband.

69
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:52,583
She loves something about him.

70
00:02:52,651 --> 00:02:53,817
<i> vitamin deficiency?</i>

71
00:02:53,885 --> 00:02:55,319
She changed her diet a few months ago.

72
00:02:55,387 --> 00:02:58,555
To a healthier diet.
Raw foods, lots of nuts.

73
00:02:58,623 --> 00:03:01,892
It's not the ear, it's the heart.

74
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,162
Her protein is cheese,
which can raise cholesterol.

75
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,297
Hers was already elevated.

76
00:03:06,364 --> 00:03:08,432
Gave her arterial blockages.

77
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,067
Cardiac arrhythmia presenting as ear pain.

78
00:03:10,135 --> 00:03:11,101
<i>Very rare.</i>

79
00:03:11,169 --> 00:03:13,003
Cool.

80
00:03:13,071 --> 00:03:15,172
So beauty and the beast.
Who wants to go see?

81
00:03:33,558 --> 00:03:38,896
Let's see--dr. Taub,
foreman, chase, and hadley.

82
00:03:38,964 --> 00:03:40,464
<i>Four for four.</i>

83
00:03:40,532 --> 00:03:42,199
Wow, I can't believe I
get all these doctors.

84
00:03:42,267 --> 00:03:43,901
And such good-looking ones too.

85
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:46,270
Yeah. It's almost like we
don't all need to be here.

86
00:03:46,338 --> 00:03:48,539
Your case presented a very interesting

87
00:03:48,606 --> 00:03:50,374
Diagnostic challenge. Oh.

88
00:03:59,017 --> 00:04:01,485
You can't sleep in your own office?

89
00:04:01,553 --> 00:04:03,320
Or bedroom for that matter?

90
00:04:03,388 --> 00:04:05,155
<i>Got to avoid my natural habitat.</i>

91
00:04:05,223 --> 00:04:08,492
Some idiot I went to med school with

92
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,894
Keeps leaving messages and
wants to drop by for lunch.

93
00:04:10,962 --> 00:04:12,129
So tell him no.

94
00:04:12,197 --> 00:04:14,565
It's complicated.

95
00:04:14,632 --> 00:04:15,833
<i>It's too complicated for you</i>

96
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,569
To tell someone you don't like to screw off?

97
00:04:18,636 --> 00:04:20,004
<i>That's practically your hobby.</i>

98
00:04:20,071 --> 00:04:21,772
<i>A few months ago he was...</i>

99
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,809
Sort of part of my therapy.

100
00:04:25,877 --> 00:04:27,411
<i>My shrink told me</i>

101
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:30,414
To write a letter of
apology to someone I hurt.

102
00:04:30,482 --> 00:04:33,050
And how did you hurt him?

103
00:04:33,118 --> 00:04:35,052
We were in a seminar on flatworm genetics.

104
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,387
I switched my final paper with his.

105
00:04:36,454 --> 00:04:37,921
<i>You plagiarized?</i>

106
00:04:37,989 --> 00:04:38,989
Doesn't sound like you.

107
00:04:39,057 --> 00:04:40,524
<i>I was testing a theory.</i>

108
00:04:40,592 --> 00:04:43,327
I thought that our professor
was biased against me.

109
00:04:43,395 --> 00:04:45,329
I assumed he'd get a
high grade with my paper

110
00:04:45,397 --> 00:04:47,731
And I'd get a low grade with his.

111
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:51,435
Interestingly, I was wrong. I got an "a".

112
00:04:51,503 --> 00:04:52,970
<i>So you're in this mental hospital,</i>

113
00:04:53,038 --> 00:04:54,972
Delving into your subconscious,

114
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,641
And this is who you choose to apologize to?

115
00:04:57,709 --> 00:04:59,043
Yep. Lorenzo wibberly.

116
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,377
Of all the people in the world you've hurt?

117
00:05:00,445 --> 00:05:01,678
<i>Not everyone has a name</i>

118
00:05:01,746 --> 00:05:04,314
That's so easy to find in the white pages.

119
00:05:04,382 --> 00:05:06,183
Um...I'm in there, and so is cuddy.

120
00:05:06,251 --> 00:05:07,885
Yeah. And yet, I picked him.

121
00:05:07,952 --> 00:05:10,387
It's funny, isn't it? Yes, it's hilarious.

122
00:05:10,455 --> 00:05:15,292
Great to see what a
success your therapy was.

123
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,995
We said we'd never go to sleep angry.

124
00:05:18,063 --> 00:05:19,663
we did find an arrhythmia.

125
00:05:19,731 --> 00:05:21,498
But it's not from your arteries.
They're clean.

126
00:05:21,566 --> 00:05:22,900
Will the pain come back?

127
00:05:22,967 --> 00:05:24,835
We'll start her on cardiac meds.
That should help.

128
00:05:24,903 --> 00:05:27,671
But we still need to figure out
what's causing the arrhytxmia.

129
00:05:27,739 --> 00:05:29,506
<i> hey, valerie.</i>

130
00:05:29,574 --> 00:05:33,077
Russ.

131
00:05:33,144 --> 00:05:34,912
It's so nice of you to stop by.

132
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:36,747
I got lots of free time now.

133
00:05:36,815 --> 00:05:38,782
You don't blame me, do you?

134
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,717
You were drunk in front of norris.

135
00:05:40,785 --> 00:05:45,456
No. No, no, no, no, no. I'm drunk now.

136
00:05:45,523 --> 00:05:49,993
Then, it was like someone
poisoned me or something.

137
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:55,866
Maybe you should come back later.

138
00:05:55,934 --> 00:05:57,301
Okay.

139
00:05:59,838 --> 00:06:02,106
I just wanna say good-bye.

140
00:06:02,173 --> 00:06:03,807
Okay, russ.

141
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,209
Thank you for coming by.

142
00:06:07,312 --> 00:06:08,512
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.

143
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,047
Hey, hey. What are you doing?

144
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,884
You poor son of a bitch.

145
00:06:13,952 --> 00:06:15,319
She doesn't love you any
more than she loved me.

146
00:06:15,386 --> 00:06:17,321
Okay, you need to leave right now.

147
00:06:17,388 --> 00:06:19,289
You're pretending you had
an affair with my wife?

148
00:06:19,357 --> 00:06:21,024
Yeah, we're all pretending.

149
00:06:21,092 --> 00:06:22,593
You got nothing to worry about.

150
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,196
Tell him where you were
six months ago, russ.

151
00:06:26,264 --> 00:06:27,764
I had a breakdown.

152
00:06:27,832 --> 00:06:31,468
I had some paranoid tendencies, as they say.

153
00:06:31,536 --> 00:06:34,938
But it turns out,
I had a right to be paranoid.

154
00:06:35,006 --> 00:06:36,039
You need help.

155
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,511
<i>Get him out of here. okay.</i>

156
00:06:40,578 --> 00:06:42,579
Okay.

157
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,220
<i> oh, my god.</i>

158
00:06:54,726 --> 00:06:56,326
Honey, are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay.

159
00:06:56,394 --> 00:06:58,095
We'll keep an eye out.

160
00:06:58,163 --> 00:07:00,931
He's not getting back into the hospital.

161
00:07:00,999 --> 00:07:03,500
He's making all that up.
You know that, right?

162
00:07:03,568 --> 00:07:06,203
Yeah, of course.

163
00:07:11,442 --> 00:07:12,843
<i> where are you?</i>

164
00:07:12,911 --> 00:07:14,278
Undisclosed location.

165
00:07:14,345 --> 00:07:15,245
<i> who are you hiding from?</i>

166
00:07:15,313 --> 00:07:16,713
Wilson.

167
00:07:16,781 --> 00:07:18,882
<i>And the lunch date that wilson is, no
doubt,</i>

168
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,884
<i>Right now trying to sic on me.</i>

169
00:07:20,952 --> 00:07:23,654
<i>But in the great game of chess that is our
relationship,</i>

170
00:07:23,721 --> 00:07:26,089
Wilson sees only one move ahead.

171
00:07:26,157 --> 00:07:27,624
I see dozens.

172
00:07:27,692 --> 00:07:31,261
<i>That is why he will never mate me.</i>

173
00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:34,198
<i>That's a chess term. That's great.</i>

174
00:07:34,265 --> 00:07:35,933
<i>A co-worker confronted our patient.</i>

175
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,501
<i>Altered mental status.</i>

176
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:39,369
<i>Basically accused her
of poisoning him.</i>

177
00:07:39,437 --> 00:07:40,504
We think he was projecting.

178
00:07:40,572 --> 00:07:42,472
<i>So he's poisoning her.</i>

179
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,707
<i> what could he get his hands on</i>

180
00:07:43,775 --> 00:07:45,375
To cause supraventricular tachycardia?

181
00:07:45,443 --> 00:07:46,944
Does he have dry skin?

182
00:07:47,011 --> 00:07:50,914
<i>Thin eyebrows?</i>

183
00:07:50,982 --> 00:07:52,382
If you're sharing an amazed look,

184
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,418
<i>Please do it louder. he might have.</i>

185
00:07:54,485 --> 00:07:55,552
How did you know that?

186
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,888
<i>If he has hypothyroidism</i>

187
00:07:57,956 --> 00:07:59,189
<i>And he dumped his meds in her coffee,</i>

188
00:07:59,257 --> 00:08:00,023
<i>That would make her heart go boom.</i>

189
00:08:00,091 --> 00:08:01,625
In a bad way.

190
00:08:01,693 --> 00:08:02,659
<i> we'll treat with beta blockers.</i>

191
00:08:02,727 --> 00:08:04,294
I'm sorry, but I totally disagree.

192
00:08:04,362 --> 00:08:06,230
<i> with what? With everything.</i>

193
00:08:06,297 --> 00:08:07,497
Why are we assuming he's lying

194
00:08:07,565 --> 00:08:09,466
And she's telling the truth?

195
00:08:09,534 --> 00:08:11,268
Because she's a successful,
happily married consultant,

196
00:08:11,336 --> 00:08:12,736
And he's a crazy, drunk weirdo

197
00:08:12,804 --> 00:08:13,870
Who we just tossed out of the hospital.

198
00:08:13,938 --> 00:08:15,706
And she's hot.

199
00:08:15,773 --> 00:08:16,807
<i> maybe she picked him because
he's vulnerable.</i>

200
00:08:16,874 --> 00:08:18,442
There's something off about her,

201
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:19,676
I can feel it.

202
00:08:19,744 --> 00:08:21,078
If you had any evidence, it would be--

203
00:08:21,145 --> 00:08:23,247
Why didn't she tell us a c
o-worker puked on her shoes

204
00:08:23,314 --> 00:08:25,482
Right before she collapsed?
Because it's medically irrelevant.

205
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,984
<i>He was drunk, she was sick.</i>

206
00:08:27,051 --> 00:08:28,785
<i> you don't think it's suspicious</i>

207
00:08:28,853 --> 00:08:30,020
<i>She didn't even mention it to her husband?
Yeah, foreman.</i>

208
00:08:30,088 --> 00:08:32,155
<i>Why did you break up with thirteen?</i>

209
00:08:32,223 --> 00:08:34,825
Oh, no, wait, the non-subtextual thing

210
00:08:34,892 --> 00:08:36,093
She was saying, why that?

211
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,029
This is about the case,
not some imaginary issue

212
00:08:39,097 --> 00:08:40,397
That you think foreman and I have.

213
00:08:40,465 --> 00:08:42,599
Great, start her on beta blockers.

214
00:08:47,872 --> 00:08:49,106
You'll do it?

215
00:08:49,173 --> 00:08:51,808
I don't think he was talking to me.

216
00:08:51,876 --> 00:08:53,477
Well, I am.

217
00:08:53,544 --> 00:08:56,280
I'm the only one who thinks you're wrong.

218
00:08:56,347 --> 00:08:58,015
Maybe that's why I'm asking you to do it.

219
00:09:16,768 --> 00:09:17,934
<i>Greg?</i>

220
00:09:18,002 --> 00:09:21,471
Lorenzo wibberly.

221
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:23,774
Dr. Wilson said you'd be here.

222
00:09:23,841 --> 00:09:25,342
How ya been?

223
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,911
Check and mate.

224
00:09:33,885 --> 00:09:35,852
Look...

225
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,690
I'm sorry this is awkward or whatever.

226
00:09:39,757 --> 00:09:41,892
I just thought it was nice
of you to write that letter,

227
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:45,662
And I wanted to tell you that
you don't have to feel bad.

228
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,964
Thanks.

229
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,968
So where are you working these days?

230
00:09:52,036 --> 00:09:54,204
You got your own practice
or you at a hospital?

231
00:09:54,272 --> 00:09:57,507
I thought you knew.

232
00:09:57,575 --> 00:09:59,710
Dani's, the organic supermarket chain.

233
00:09:59,777 --> 00:10:01,678
As an in house doctor?

234
00:10:01,746 --> 00:10:05,882
I actually never got licensed.

235
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,684
I didn't graduate med school.

236
00:10:07,752 --> 00:10:10,354
<i>I planned on going back, and then my father
got sick</i>

237
00:10:10,421 --> 00:10:11,388
<i>And I had to take care of him</i>

238
00:10:11,456 --> 00:10:14,458
And had some bad luck.

239
00:10:14,525 --> 00:10:16,126
Why didn't you graduate?

240
00:10:16,194 --> 00:10:17,961
I was one credit short.

241
00:10:18,029 --> 00:10:19,696
<i>And I was sort of already on
academic probation.</i>

242
00:10:19,764 --> 00:10:23,033
<i>So... Which credit?</i>

243
00:10:23,101 --> 00:10:28,038
I got a, um...

244
00:10:28,106 --> 00:10:30,240
He failed me on that paper you switched.

245
00:10:30,308 --> 00:10:33,443
<i>I thought you knew.</i>

246
00:10:33,511 --> 00:10:36,513
So I'm guessing you're the ceo
of this supermarket chain?

247
00:10:36,581 --> 00:10:40,851
I bag groceries.

248
00:10:40,918 --> 00:10:42,519
<i>Life works out weird sometimes.</i>

249
00:10:48,793 --> 00:10:49,960
We were gonna do it in santa barbara

250
00:10:50,027 --> 00:10:51,461
Because of his parents.

251
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:54,030
<i>But then I found this beautiful
hotel in montauk and--</i>

252
00:10:54,098 --> 00:10:55,599
<i> you're testing her</i>

253
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:56,633
For a brain tumor?

254
00:10:56,701 --> 00:10:58,068
That's what I told her.

255
00:10:58,136 --> 00:11:00,203
You can chastise me after
you look at the monitor.

256
00:11:00,271 --> 00:11:03,039
<i>Look wt's lighting up.
Lateral frontal cortex.</i>

257
00:11:03,107 --> 00:11:04,608
Broca's area--so what?

258
00:11:04,675 --> 00:11:06,143
I told her it was customary
to talk during mris,

259
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,377
To relax.

260
00:11:07,445 --> 00:11:09,012
<i>I spent the last 30 minutes</i>

261
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,447
<i>Asking her about everything in life</i>

262
00:11:10,515 --> 00:11:13,617
<i>That she loves, then hates,</i>

263
00:11:13,684 --> 00:11:14,985
Then feels any emotion about at all.

264
00:11:15,052 --> 00:11:17,387
There's nothing in the
paralimbic system, amygdala.

265
00:11:17,455 --> 00:11:18,822
Because she's using the
language part of her brain

266
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,490
And bypassing the emotional.

267
00:11:20,558 --> 00:11:22,692
<i>She can understand love and
pain and empathy,</i>

268
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,129
But she can't feel them at all.

269
00:11:26,197 --> 00:11:28,498
She's a psychopath.

270
00:11:32,788 --> 00:11:34,055
Why do you want to meet her so badly?

271
00:11:34,122 --> 00:11:36,057
Psychopaths always fascinate me.

272
00:11:36,124 --> 00:11:38,025
I think it's their cultural literacy

273
00:11:38,093 --> 00:11:39,894
And strong family values.

274
00:11:39,962 --> 00:11:41,462
Or is that jews?

275
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:42,830
We're not gonna be able to
get an honest read on her

276
00:11:42,898 --> 00:11:44,065
Unless we figure out

277
00:11:44,132 --> 00:11:45,232
A way to get the husband out of there.

278
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,201
Hmm. I got an idea.

279
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:50,538
Can you get out of here?

280
00:11:50,606 --> 00:11:51,806
Thanks.

281
00:11:57,312 --> 00:12:00,214
It was the "thanks" that did it.

282
00:12:00,282 --> 00:12:02,984
Hi, I'm dr. House.

283
00:12:03,051 --> 00:12:05,386
How long have you been a psychopath?

284
00:12:07,222 --> 00:12:09,357
Are you kidding? He's not.

285
00:12:09,424 --> 00:12:12,026
Are you saying I'm like
ted bundy or something?

286
00:12:12,094 --> 00:12:13,794
<i>Psychopathy can get a bad rap.</i>

287
00:12:13,862 --> 00:12:15,830
It doesn't necessarily mean you're violent.

288
00:12:15,897 --> 00:12:17,598
<i>Just that you're completely
without conscience,</i>

289
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,100
You lack any normal emotion,

290
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:20,635
You manipulate everyone around you,

291
00:12:20,702 --> 00:12:22,703
You're promiscuous, you lie pathologically.

292
00:12:22,771 --> 00:12:25,106
Any of this ringing bells?

293
00:12:25,173 --> 00:12:27,341
Is that why you were asking
me all those weird questions?

294
00:12:27,409 --> 00:12:29,977
<i>Yeah--though you have darwin
to thank for that.</i>

295
00:12:30,045 --> 00:12:31,946
She got the creeps around you.

296
00:12:32,014 --> 00:12:34,281
Which oddly, is an actual medical phenomenon

297
00:12:34,349 --> 00:12:35,683
<i>Around psychopaths.</i>

298
00:12:35,751 --> 00:12:37,218
<i>Probably an evolved response to
predators.</i>

299
00:12:37,285 --> 00:12:39,920
I'm sorry, you're really freaking me out.

300
00:12:39,988 --> 00:12:42,723
I have no idea what-- relax.

301
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,291
We have a duty of confidentiality.

302
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:46,193
And you have an undiagnosed heart problem

303
00:12:46,261 --> 00:12:48,029
That could kill you at any moment.

304
00:12:48,096 --> 00:12:50,665
<i>We believe that your
mental abnormality</i>

305
00:12:50,732 --> 00:12:51,899
<i>Is related to your physical one.</i>

306
00:12:51,967 --> 00:12:54,769
So if you want to keep on predating...

307
00:13:02,811 --> 00:13:04,612
What do you want to know?

308
00:13:12,988 --> 00:13:14,955
Your co-worker's story was true.

309
00:13:15,023 --> 00:13:16,924
<i>You poisoned him. No.</i>

310
00:13:16,992 --> 00:13:20,361
I gave him a little valium and an emetic.

311
00:13:20,429 --> 00:13:23,197
You sure you understand
what the word "no" means?

312
00:13:23,265 --> 00:13:24,365
I've had them both before, why can't he?

313
00:13:24,433 --> 00:13:26,000
So you were just helping him out?

314
00:13:26,068 --> 00:13:27,702
And I assume he was cool
with the whole seducing

315
00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:29,470
And firing part too?

316
00:13:29,538 --> 00:13:31,706
Russ knew what he was getting into.

317
00:13:31,773 --> 00:13:33,507
He got sex every Thursday night,

318
00:13:33,575 --> 00:13:35,776
And I got to take credit for his best ideas.

319
00:13:35,844 --> 00:13:37,511
And what are you getting
out of your marriage?

320
00:13:37,579 --> 00:13:39,180
Same thing you get out of your job.

321
00:13:39,247 --> 00:13:41,282
Bill has a trust fund.

322
00:13:41,349 --> 00:13:44,018
And I have a prenup his
parents made me sign.

323
00:13:44,086 --> 00:13:45,920
Told you he was rich.

324
00:13:45,987 --> 00:13:47,722
She's not that weird.

325
00:13:47,789 --> 00:13:49,557
I'm not so different than anybody else.

326
00:13:49,624 --> 00:13:52,159
Everyone I've ever known-
my family, my classmates,

327
00:13:52,227 --> 00:13:54,228
The people I work with--

328
00:13:54,296 --> 00:13:55,763
They're all out for themselves.

329
00:13:55,831 --> 00:13:57,531
Difference is, I could admit it to myself.

330
00:13:57,599 --> 00:13:59,333
She kind of reminds me of someone I know.

331
00:13:59,401 --> 00:14:00,701
Tell me about it.

332
00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:02,870
Some of my co-workers will insult people

333
00:14:02,938 --> 00:14:04,271
Right to their faces.

334
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:05,806
How long have you been this way?

335
00:14:08,677 --> 00:14:11,212
Just how I am.

336
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,115
Are you gonna cure my heart problems now?

337
00:14:14,182 --> 00:14:19,253
So psychopathy plus cardiac arrhythmia. Go.

338
00:14:19,321 --> 00:14:21,155
I thought you were bluffing
to get information.

339
00:14:21,223 --> 00:14:22,757
You really think they're connected?

340
00:14:22,824 --> 00:14:24,859
Two rare conditions in one patient,

341
00:14:24,926 --> 00:14:25,993
It's a fair assumption they are.

342
00:14:26,061 --> 00:14:28,162
Psychopathy is generally just genetic.

343
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,363
Nothing you can do about it.

344
00:14:29,431 --> 00:14:30,698
Something that hits 30 years after birth

345
00:14:30,766 --> 00:14:32,133
Isn't gonna be connected.

346
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,368
Her disease isn't gonna
lie dormant that long.

347
00:14:34,436 --> 00:14:35,836
Did her heart warp her brain?

348
00:14:35,904 --> 00:14:37,471
Maybe a handful of diseases.

349
00:14:37,539 --> 00:14:39,940
It'll be super awesome when we find it.

350
00:14:40,008 --> 00:14:42,443
Tertiary syphilis can cause
pseudopsychopathic syndrome

351
00:14:42,511 --> 00:14:43,577
<i>And cardiomyopathy.</i>

352
00:14:43,645 --> 00:14:44,812
Fits best.

353
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,080
Start her on penicillin,

354
00:14:46,148 --> 00:14:47,481
And rule out wilson's and hashimoto's.

355
00:14:47,549 --> 00:14:49,183
There's your handful.

356
00:14:49,251 --> 00:14:50,684
Wasn't so hard, was it?

357
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,828
You've gotta do something about thirteen.

358
00:15:00,896 --> 00:15:03,264
She flouted both my authority and yours.

359
00:15:03,331 --> 00:15:06,433
Yes, and she got it right
and you got it wrong.

360
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:07,835
Which just aggravates the problem.

361
00:15:07,903 --> 00:15:09,370
She'll do it again.

362
00:15:09,437 --> 00:15:12,673
Next time it won't work out so well.

363
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:14,341
You gotta punish her.

364
00:15:14,409 --> 00:15:16,243
You're her boss.

365
00:15:16,311 --> 00:15:19,113
In some vague, never to
be usefully defined way.

366
00:15:19,181 --> 00:15:21,515
You punish her. I'm also her ex,

367
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:24,084
Which, as you know,
makes it a little complicated.

368
00:15:24,152 --> 00:15:25,986
The fact that you also fired her

369
00:15:26,054 --> 00:15:27,121
Takes it from a little complicated

370
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:28,222
To a little moronic.

371
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,490
It was the only way I could--

372
00:15:29,558 --> 00:15:31,058
It wasn't because you
were too in love with her.

373
00:15:31,126 --> 00:15:32,993
It was because you were too
in love with your career.

374
00:15:33,061 --> 00:15:35,162
We're almost at my floor so I'll summarize.

375
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,797
Your problem, not mine.

376
00:15:42,571 --> 00:15:44,772
You cut up my only copy of that photo.

377
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,241
That rare daguerreotype.

378
00:15:47,309 --> 00:15:48,843
You can charge me for the effort it takes

379
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,578
To search your hard drive for a new copy.

380
00:15:50,645 --> 00:15:53,047
Not the one of me and lucas.

381
00:15:53,114 --> 00:15:55,349
The one from ecuador. Right.

382
00:15:55,417 --> 00:15:57,084
I had forgotten your deep
emotional attachment to lemurs.

383
00:15:57,152 --> 00:15:59,053
To my dad.

384
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,488
You got his tail.

385
00:16:01,556 --> 00:16:02,990
He was holding the camera.

386
00:16:03,058 --> 00:16:06,160
That was the last trip
we ever took together.

387
00:16:06,228 --> 00:16:08,796
And I don't have a digital copy.

388
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,734
Well, I could stand here
all day apologizing,

389
00:16:13,802 --> 00:16:17,137
But I'd rather expiate my
sins with good clean work.

390
00:16:19,774 --> 00:16:21,642
You ignoring my texts?

391
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,510
The crazy ones you sent

392
00:16:23,578 --> 00:16:25,613
Trying to get me to make you feel better

393
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,047
About destroying your classmate's life?

394
00:16:27,115 --> 00:16:29,083
No, I never got those.

395
00:16:37,626 --> 00:16:40,694
Dr. Wilson...

396
00:16:40,762 --> 00:16:42,363
Wibberly's got some agenda.

397
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,798
Probably trying to guilt me
into getting him a better job.

398
00:16:44,866 --> 00:16:46,934
How pissed was he? Not at all.

399
00:16:47,002 --> 00:16:49,904
That's how I know he's got an agenda.

400
00:16:58,513 --> 00:16:59,980
<i>If you feel guilty, you should do something
to help.</i>

401
00:17:00,048 --> 00:17:02,049
You are responsible.

402
00:17:09,658 --> 00:17:10,658
Thanks.

403
00:17:18,366 --> 00:17:19,667
What?

404
00:17:19,734 --> 00:17:21,068
All I'm responsible for

405
00:17:21,136 --> 00:17:22,870
Is the foreseeable consequences
of switching papers.

406
00:17:22,938 --> 00:17:24,772
A bad grade or a sleepless night,

407
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,874
Worst case, a retest.

408
00:17:26,942 --> 00:17:28,776
There was no way to know
that one seminar paper

409
00:17:28,843 --> 00:17:30,978
Was gonna destroy this idiot's life.

410
00:17:31,046 --> 00:17:32,579
<i>If there's any karma in all this,</i>

411
00:17:32,647 --> 00:17:34,348
He's probably happier than you are.

412
00:17:36,451 --> 00:17:38,485
Good point.

413
00:17:38,553 --> 00:17:40,154
If he's happier, there's no harm done.

414
00:17:40,221 --> 00:17:42,056
I'll go find out.

415
00:17:42,123 --> 00:17:43,958
That is absolutely not what I said.

416
00:17:44,025 --> 00:17:45,426
Always with the modesty, this one.

417
00:18:02,077 --> 00:18:06,714
What did--

418
00:18:08,283 --> 00:18:10,150
Hmm...

419
00:18:15,123 --> 00:18:17,424
You want something to eat?

420
00:18:17,492 --> 00:18:20,728
I'm cool.

421
00:18:20,795 --> 00:18:23,097
How's work?

422
00:18:23,164 --> 00:18:25,232
You happy with it?

423
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:29,903
You know... It's a job.

424
00:18:29,971 --> 00:18:31,405
I don't need to take any
work home with me at least.

425
00:18:31,473 --> 00:18:33,907
Free time...

426
00:18:33,975 --> 00:18:35,376
Wouldn't have any of that
if you were a doctor.

427
00:18:35,443 --> 00:18:39,947
Yeah. True.

428
00:18:40,015 --> 00:18:42,249
You like chili? I could reheat some.

429
00:18:42,317 --> 00:18:44,818
Is that your yard?

430
00:18:44,886 --> 00:18:48,655
That's nice. Yeah.

431
00:18:48,723 --> 00:18:51,959
That sugar maple, 100, 150 years old.

432
00:18:52,027 --> 00:18:55,195
Most beautiful leaves in the fall.

433
00:18:55,263 --> 00:18:57,064
Sitting underneath on the bench--

434
00:18:57,132 --> 00:19:00,401
It's like paradise.

435
00:19:00,468 --> 00:19:02,936
I don't have a yard, myself.

436
00:19:03,004 --> 00:19:06,407
You got a good thing going.

437
00:19:06,474 --> 00:19:07,875
I know.

438
00:19:07,942 --> 00:19:11,045
So what are the boxes for?

439
00:19:11,112 --> 00:19:14,214
I'm moving.

440
00:19:14,282 --> 00:19:15,949
From paradise?

441
00:19:16,017 --> 00:19:17,484
Well, my dad's medical bills

442
00:19:17,552 --> 00:19:18,819
And me being one of those idiots

443
00:19:18,887 --> 00:19:20,320
That got an adjustable mortgage.

444
00:19:20,388 --> 00:19:23,257
So... You're losing your home?

445
00:19:23,324 --> 00:19:25,959
Hey, it could be worse, right?

446
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:30,364
How?

447
00:19:30,432 --> 00:19:32,299
Even if the tests are positive,

448
00:19:32,367 --> 00:19:33,500
You don't have to worry.

449
00:19:33,568 --> 00:19:35,369
You're testing for syphilis, not a cold.

450
00:19:35,437 --> 00:19:37,271
Honey...

451
00:19:37,338 --> 00:19:38,338
<i> at this stage, it's probably
not communicable.</i>

452
00:19:38,406 --> 00:19:40,074
You think I'm worried about myself?

453
00:19:40,141 --> 00:19:41,542
<i>I just want my wife to get better.</i>

454
00:19:41,609 --> 00:19:42,876
She might have caught it at birth.

455
00:19:42,944 --> 00:19:44,945
So it doesn't prove she was cheating.

456
00:19:45,013 --> 00:19:46,780
If you were worried about that.

457
00:19:46,848 --> 00:19:49,550
<i>Of course not. How many weeks
am I gonna have to--</i>

458
00:19:49,617 --> 00:19:50,651
You okay?

459
00:19:50,718 --> 00:19:51,985
<i>Why is she coughing?</i>

460
00:19:52,053 --> 00:19:53,220
I don't know. Do you want some water?

461
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,225
Are you threatened by me?

462
00:20:02,664 --> 00:20:03,730
Not at all.

463
00:20:03,798 --> 00:20:05,466
Well, you should be.

464
00:20:05,533 --> 00:20:06,967
<i>You let him know what I told you,</i>

465
00:20:07,035 --> 00:20:08,602
<i>I will not only have your
license pulled,</i>

466
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:11,071
I will sue you for everything
I lose in the divorce.

467
00:20:11,139 --> 00:20:12,372
So the fun you get out of

468
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,941
Making those snotty little comments,

469
00:20:14,008 --> 00:20:16,577
Is it worth $19 million?

470
00:20:16,644 --> 00:20:18,278
Oh, wait, will you hold that look?

471
00:20:18,346 --> 00:20:20,581
I'm really bad at showing emotions.

472
00:20:20,648 --> 00:20:21,849
How's this?

473
00:20:24,586 --> 00:20:26,120
Thanks, baby.

474
00:20:26,187 --> 00:20:29,656
Can I have your arm please?

475
00:20:31,192 --> 00:20:33,160
Ah! Oh! Oh!

476
00:20:33,228 --> 00:20:35,262
Oh! Oh!

477
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:37,764
My arm! You broke it!

478
00:20:43,044 --> 00:20:44,277
I don't know what happened.

479
00:20:44,345 --> 00:20:46,246
Neither do I, but I know
what happened after.

480
00:20:46,314 --> 00:20:47,847
She called cuddy and demanded

481
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:50,483
That I kick you off the case.

482
00:20:50,551 --> 00:20:52,619
I backed you up, because I trust you.

483
00:20:52,687 --> 00:20:53,987
But you're gonna have
to earn that trust now.

484
00:20:54,055 --> 00:20:55,755
Thanks.

485
00:20:55,823 --> 00:20:57,924
Actually, he backed you up

486
00:20:57,992 --> 00:21:00,260
Because of the new b.U.
N. Creatinine numbers.

487
00:21:00,328 --> 00:21:02,329
Brittle bones were from kidney failure.

488
00:21:02,396 --> 00:21:03,663
There is that.

489
00:21:03,731 --> 00:21:05,532
So heart and kidneys.

490
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:07,033
And brain.

491
00:21:07,101 --> 00:21:08,768
Nope. Psychopathy is not a symptom.

492
00:21:08,836 --> 00:21:10,937
<i>It was yesterday. In the meantime,</i>

493
00:21:11,005 --> 00:21:12,339
Kidney failure ruled out syphilis

494
00:21:12,406 --> 00:21:14,107
And testing ruled out the
other ideas that would've fit.

495
00:21:14,175 --> 00:21:16,176
Protein levels, kidneys, arrhythmia.

496
00:21:16,243 --> 00:21:19,179
Could be paraneoplastic. I'd say lymphoma.

497
00:21:19,246 --> 00:21:20,513
Get her to radiotherapy.

498
00:21:20,581 --> 00:21:21,848
We can't start radiation

499
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:23,450
Without immunoassays on her urine.

500
00:21:23,517 --> 00:21:25,285
Great, so you cast a spell
and magically fix her kidney

501
00:21:25,353 --> 00:21:26,886
<i>So she can give us some
urine to test.</i>

502
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:28,555
We have some left over from admission.

503
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:30,590
Not enough for a completely
accurate reading.

504
00:21:30,658 --> 00:21:31,958
Then how about partially accurate?

505
00:21:32,026 --> 00:21:34,794
Those of you who haven't
slept together, you can go.

506
00:21:34,862 --> 00:21:35,929
<i>Everyone else, stay behind.</i>

507
00:21:42,203 --> 00:21:43,336
Oh.

508
00:21:43,404 --> 00:21:44,904
Sorry.

509
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:47,607
That was our secret, right?

510
00:21:53,214 --> 00:21:55,148
Go have sex. No, thanks.

511
00:21:55,216 --> 00:21:56,816
Fine, I'll cover the
viagra and the lubricants.

512
00:21:56,884 --> 00:21:58,118
Just get me a receipt.

513
00:21:58,185 --> 00:21:59,185
<i>We have zero feelings for each other.</i>

514
00:21:59,253 --> 00:22:00,620
Well, that's too bad,

515
00:22:00,688 --> 00:22:03,156
'cause things worked
much better when you did.

516
00:22:03,224 --> 00:22:04,424
Would it help if I slept with her?

517
00:22:04,492 --> 00:22:05,825
We were getting to a diagnosis.

518
00:22:05,893 --> 00:22:07,961
No, we were already at the diagnosis.

519
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:09,262
You were creating a fake argument

520
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:10,630
About an irrelevant treatment issue,

521
00:22:10,698 --> 00:22:12,565
'cause you can't stand
to be around each other.

522
00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:14,701
So have sex, fight or quit, I don't care.

523
00:22:14,769 --> 00:22:17,203
Whatever you're doing now isn't working.

524
00:22:27,348 --> 00:22:29,682
<i> you okay? Yeah.</i>

525
00:22:31,385 --> 00:22:34,487
Look, I get that you gotta act fast--

526
00:22:34,555 --> 00:22:35,755
Radiation?

527
00:22:35,823 --> 00:22:37,557
You definitely ruled out everything else?

528
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:41,828
I'm sorry, but...

529
00:22:41,896 --> 00:22:44,297
We could still check for
environmental toxins.

530
00:22:44,365 --> 00:22:46,566
Where does she spend most of her time?

531
00:22:46,634 --> 00:22:49,202
Mostly at work, at home-- hobbies?

532
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,870
Recurring activities outside the home?

533
00:22:50,938 --> 00:22:52,272
No, not really.

534
00:22:52,339 --> 00:22:54,607
She took a landscaping class.

535
00:22:54,675 --> 00:22:56,743
At the y. When did it meet?

536
00:22:56,811 --> 00:23:00,680
Every Thursday night this summer.

537
00:23:00,748 --> 00:23:02,082
You dig in soil,

538
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:04,784
You can be exposed to pesticides,
heavy metals,

539
00:23:04,852 --> 00:23:06,319
Lots of bad things.

540
00:23:06,387 --> 00:23:08,488
Can you find out all about
her landscaping class,

541
00:23:08,556 --> 00:23:10,523
Where it was, details like that?

542
00:23:10,591 --> 00:23:11,825
Yeah, I'll do it now.

543
00:23:19,967 --> 00:23:22,435
<i>So when you watch star wars,</i>

544
00:23:22,503 --> 00:23:26,106
Which side do you root for?

545
00:23:26,173 --> 00:23:28,942
Dr. House.

546
00:23:29,009 --> 00:23:30,043
What are you doing?

547
00:23:30,111 --> 00:23:34,280
Just checking in on your radiotherapy.

548
00:23:34,348 --> 00:23:37,617
From what I hear, you never visit patients.

549
00:23:37,685 --> 00:23:40,587
And now, you've come to chat with me twice.

550
00:23:40,654 --> 00:23:43,456
I want to know how you like
being a management consultant.

551
00:23:43,524 --> 00:23:45,391
I'm thinking of getting into it.

552
00:23:45,459 --> 00:23:47,460
That or psychopathy, maybe.

553
00:23:47,528 --> 00:23:49,996
Which pays better?

554
00:23:50,064 --> 00:23:52,365
I think you're already into one of them.

555
00:23:52,433 --> 00:23:54,701
<i>Dr. Hadley made a joke yesterday.</i>

556
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:58,104
<i>She said I sound like you.</i>

557
00:23:58,172 --> 00:24:00,874
I'm sure you understand what joke means.

558
00:24:00,941 --> 00:24:02,876
<i>So you're not just out for yourself?</i>

559
00:24:02,943 --> 00:24:05,145
For example, you would never

560
00:24:05,212 --> 00:24:06,513
Interrupt a sick woman's treatment

561
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:10,183
Just because of some personal obsession?

562
00:24:10,251 --> 00:24:12,152
Of course I'm self-interested.

563
00:24:12,219 --> 00:24:14,988
We all are. We're born that way.

564
00:24:15,055 --> 00:24:17,991
The rest of us are born with consciences.

565
00:24:18,058 --> 00:24:22,529
<i>Which is something you just sound ecstatic
about.</i>

566
00:24:22,596 --> 00:24:23,696
I'm not saying it's logical.

567
00:24:23,764 --> 00:24:24,931
I'm just saying it's human.

568
00:24:24,999 --> 00:24:27,634
So if you know your conscience

569
00:24:27,701 --> 00:24:29,569
Is just an animal instinct,

570
00:24:29,637 --> 00:24:31,571
You don't need to follow it.

571
00:24:31,639 --> 00:24:35,708
<i>I think you realize that.</i>

572
00:24:35,776 --> 00:24:37,143
<i>That's why you're talking to me.</i>

573
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:58,765
You lied about your landscaping class.

574
00:25:00,768 --> 00:25:02,402
Dr. Hadley thought the
soils might be poisoned.

575
00:25:02,469 --> 00:25:03,836
You told him that?

576
00:25:03,904 --> 00:25:05,505
I just thought--

577
00:25:05,573 --> 00:25:07,440
<i>Russ said you were having an affair.</i>

578
00:25:07,508 --> 00:25:08,975
Was that your cover?

579
00:25:09,043 --> 00:25:13,413
<i>Every Thursday night you'd--</i>

580
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,581
I'm so sorry.

581
00:25:14,648 --> 00:25:18,151
Oh, god.

582
00:25:18,219 --> 00:25:19,652
<i>It's not what you think.</i>

583
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,154
Do you remember that telecom case

584
00:25:21,222 --> 00:25:22,655
I said that we didn't get last year?

585
00:25:22,723 --> 00:25:25,491
<i>In fact, we did, and I was swamped.</i>

586
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:27,727
Every Friday morning we had a
conference call with london,

587
00:25:27,795 --> 00:25:28,895
So the night before I would--

588
00:25:28,963 --> 00:25:30,563
<i>That's your excuse?</i>

589
00:25:30,631 --> 00:25:32,632
You expect me to believe
that you were at the office?

590
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,068
What's the biggest argument we've ever had?

591
00:25:35,135 --> 00:25:36,836
<i>You said I spend too much time</i>

592
00:25:36,904 --> 00:25:38,371
Away from home.

593
00:25:38,439 --> 00:25:40,073
That I don't need a job,
that you would take care of me.

594
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,375
Yeah, that's all true.

595
00:25:42,443 --> 00:25:43,743
You yelled at me.

596
00:25:43,811 --> 00:25:45,011
You made me feel

597
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:47,814
Like you didn't value anything that I did.

598
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:50,383
<i>I need this job</i>

599
00:25:50,451 --> 00:25:52,819
To feel like I'm accomplishing
something on my own.

600
00:25:52,886 --> 00:25:54,921
<i>That's why I lied to you.</i>

601
00:25:54,989 --> 00:25:56,756
If I call your office tomorrow and I check--

602
00:25:56,824 --> 00:25:58,691
Call my office, call my secretary,

603
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:00,360
Call my clients-- interrupt their dinner,

604
00:26:00,427 --> 00:26:02,161
<i>Wake them up, I don't care.</i>

605
00:26:02,229 --> 00:26:04,030
I just want you to know the truth.

606
00:26:06,267 --> 00:26:08,034
You know I love you.

607
00:26:10,671 --> 00:26:12,538
Come here.

608
00:26:12,606 --> 00:26:14,507
<i>Please.</i>

609
00:26:22,316 --> 00:26:23,449
It's okay.

610
00:26:31,641 --> 00:26:33,508
Fire her. What for?

611
00:26:33,576 --> 00:26:35,310
You seemed to have lied
your way out of any trouble.

612
00:26:35,378 --> 00:26:37,079
Until bill checks up on my cover.

613
00:26:37,146 --> 00:26:38,080
And I have to create a whole new one

614
00:26:38,147 --> 00:26:39,247
To cover that one up.

615
00:26:39,315 --> 00:26:41,016
I've done it before but it's a pain.

616
00:26:41,084 --> 00:26:43,719
And I would like dr.
Hadley to share that pain.

617
00:26:43,786 --> 00:26:45,187
She didn't reveal any confidences,

618
00:26:45,254 --> 00:26:46,421
And she had a valid medical reason

619
00:26:46,489 --> 00:26:47,856
To ask about your landscaping class.

620
00:26:47,924 --> 00:26:49,958
We can see what a jury says about that.

621
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:51,493
<i>And admit to your husband the truth?</i>

622
00:26:51,561 --> 00:26:53,662
You're not gonna sue us.

623
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:55,564
We will remove dr.
Hadley from all patient contact.

624
00:26:55,631 --> 00:26:57,065
What?

625
00:26:57,133 --> 00:27:00,469
But it's for dr.
Hadley's benefit, not yours.

626
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:03,905
We have no obligation to inflict you on her.

627
00:27:03,973 --> 00:27:06,208
Fine.

628
00:27:06,275 --> 00:27:09,177
But just so you know,
this is not for your benefit.

629
00:27:09,245 --> 00:27:12,047
Dr. Cuddy's furious at you
put her hospital at risk.

630
00:27:12,115 --> 00:27:13,548
<i>She just knows it's a bad idea</i>

631
00:27:13,616 --> 00:27:15,450
<i>To admit it in front of me.</i>

632
00:27:15,518 --> 00:27:16,918
<i>Think what you want.</i>

633
00:27:16,986 --> 00:27:18,453
<i>By the way, your orderly's outside.</i>

634
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:22,290
But I'd wait about another ten minutes

635
00:27:22,358 --> 00:27:23,592
If you really want your husband

636
00:27:23,659 --> 00:27:25,660
To think you're having radiation treatments.

637
00:27:28,731 --> 00:27:32,701
Dr. Hadley, are you by chance gonna cry?

638
00:27:34,203 --> 00:27:38,140
'cause that's one I just can't do.

639
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,525
Hello?

640
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,493
This is dr. Hadley.

641
00:28:01,964 --> 00:28:02,964
What?

642
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:08,336
You called the medical board?

643
00:28:08,404 --> 00:28:10,205
What is she talking about?

644
00:28:10,273 --> 00:28:12,174
<i>Accusations of sexual harassment.</i>

645
00:28:12,241 --> 00:28:13,241
You don't think I know it's you?

646
00:28:13,309 --> 00:28:14,943
Thirteen, come on.

647
00:28:15,011 --> 00:28:16,144
You already got me fired from the case.

648
00:28:16,212 --> 00:28:17,813
What else do you want? Dr. Hadley.

649
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:21,516
<i>Get out here now.</i>

650
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:31,226
You're acting like an idiot.

651
00:28:31,294 --> 00:28:32,894
She's trying to make me lose my license.

652
00:28:32,962 --> 00:28:34,696
And she'll fail, unless you're stupid enough

653
00:28:34,764 --> 00:28:36,131
<i>To go in there and scream at her.</i>

654
00:28:36,199 --> 00:28:38,300
Sexual harassment accusations
are incredibly serious.

655
00:28:38,367 --> 00:28:40,635
If she made them anonymously,
the case goes away.

656
00:28:40,703 --> 00:28:42,003
<i>If she used her name,
we all back you up,</i>

657
00:28:42,071 --> 00:28:44,472
It goes away.

658
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,640
You're completely overreacting.

659
00:28:45,708 --> 00:28:47,742
You'd be pissed off too if you were me.

660
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,010
Or maybe not, I don't know.

661
00:28:49,078 --> 00:28:50,579
You're just about as emotional as she is.

662
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:51,780
I'm doing you a favor. I know.

663
00:28:51,848 --> 00:28:53,648
And even when you try to do something nice,

664
00:28:53,716 --> 00:28:57,052
<i>You sound like a jerk.</i>

665
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:58,987
I'm sorry.

666
00:28:59,055 --> 00:29:01,690
For what?

667
00:29:01,757 --> 00:29:04,359
For firing you.

668
00:29:04,427 --> 00:29:07,229
Don't do that,
that's not what this is about.

669
00:29:07,296 --> 00:29:09,130
<i>Then I'll apologize anyway.</i>

670
00:29:09,198 --> 00:29:12,601
I did it for me. Not for you.

671
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:16,471
I realized that right after I fired you.

672
00:29:16,539 --> 00:29:20,375
But I couldn't admit it.

673
00:29:20,443 --> 00:29:22,110
Screwed everything up.

674
00:29:22,178 --> 00:29:26,548
I hope that we can still work together.

675
00:29:31,254 --> 00:29:32,754
something's wrong with her liver.

676
00:29:32,822 --> 00:29:35,323
Blood flow is backing up,
spilling into her esophagus.

677
00:29:35,391 --> 00:29:36,658
<i> from the cancer?
This isn't lymphoma.</i>

678
00:29:36,726 --> 00:29:37,859
We don't know what it is.

679
00:29:37,927 --> 00:29:39,261
We can wrap bands around the veins,

680
00:29:39,328 --> 00:29:40,996
But the bleed is so bad,
that might not work.

681
00:29:41,063 --> 00:29:42,664
I want to try something called a "tips,"

682
00:29:42,732 --> 00:29:44,633
A shunt that makes the
blood bypass the liver.

683
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,334
That--that'll save her?

684
00:29:46,402 --> 00:29:47,836
<i>It should help preserve her liver and
heart.</i>

685
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:49,604
<i>The liver cleans out toxins,</i>

686
00:29:49,672 --> 00:29:51,172
Bypass it too long, she'll get brain damage,

687
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,307
Eventually die.

688
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:53,541
That's still probably less dangerous

689
00:29:53,609 --> 00:29:54,576
Than bleeding out now. Probably?

690
00:29:57,747 --> 00:29:59,447
Valerie usually makes the decisions.

691
00:29:59,515 --> 00:30:00,315
You gotta step up now.

692
00:30:02,652 --> 00:30:04,319
Was she cheating on me?

693
00:30:04,387 --> 00:30:05,854
I can't discuss--

694
00:30:05,922 --> 00:30:07,589
Just tell me she wasn't lying.

695
00:30:07,657 --> 00:30:09,424
Just tell me that.

696
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:17,499
I'm supposed to make this decision?

697
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:20,101
I don't even know who she is anymore.

698
00:30:20,169 --> 00:30:21,970
Either way, you gotta do it right now.

699
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,007
Do whatever you think is right.

700
00:30:37,115 --> 00:30:39,015
I'd give her a day. Two days at the most.

701
00:30:39,683 --> 00:30:41,350
Great. You be the clock.

702
00:30:41,418 --> 00:30:42,985
Everyone else will be the doctors.

703
00:30:43,053 --> 00:30:45,087
Heart, kidneys, now liver.

704
00:30:45,155 --> 00:30:46,822
<i>Amyloidosis? no speckles on the mri.</i>

705
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:48,190
Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency?

706
00:30:48,258 --> 00:30:49,291
Too much kidney failure.

707
00:30:50,861 --> 00:30:53,829
Primary hepatic fibrosis?

708
00:30:53,897 --> 00:30:55,998
That's our best guess.
Start her on steroids.

709
00:30:56,066 --> 00:30:57,132
<i> even if we're right,</i>

710
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,034
<i>The liver's probably too scarred.</i>

711
00:30:59,102 --> 00:31:00,503
We've got to list her for a new one.

712
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:02,171
With an unconfirmed diagnosis?
Not gonna happen.

713
00:31:02,239 --> 00:31:03,939
<i> how about a family member?</i>

714
00:31:04,007 --> 00:31:04,907
<i> I don't think the husband is
the right blood type.</i>

715
00:31:04,975 --> 00:31:06,175
Even if he was,

716
00:31:06,243 --> 00:31:07,409
He's not gonna give his liver now.

717
00:31:07,477 --> 00:31:08,577
He left her, I assume?

718
00:31:08,645 --> 00:31:10,145
<i> not yet.</i>

719
00:31:10,213 --> 00:31:12,114
Says he won't abandon her while she's sick.

720
00:31:12,182 --> 00:31:14,817
<i>She have any other family members?</i>

721
00:31:14,885 --> 00:31:17,152
No one's gonna risk their life to save hers.

722
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,488
Man, one false accusation from a psychopath,

723
00:31:19,556 --> 00:31:21,557
And you turned out to be a real bummer.

724
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:23,959
I'm gonna go see if
wilson has the liver left.

725
00:31:37,207 --> 00:31:39,608
What are you doing?

726
00:31:39,676 --> 00:31:42,044
Paying wibberly's mortgage for a few months.

727
00:31:42,112 --> 00:31:45,848
Congratulations on another
successful round of ctoring.

728
00:31:45,916 --> 00:31:48,083
Wait a minute, is that
actually a check for him?

729
00:31:48,151 --> 00:31:49,518
No.

730
00:31:49,586 --> 00:31:51,720
It's a giant novelty item
for winning the lottery.

731
00:31:51,788 --> 00:31:52,988
You're just standing really far away.

732
00:31:53,056 --> 00:31:57,159
Of all the people to go the extra mile for,

733
00:31:57,227 --> 00:31:58,727
Why this guy? I don't know.

734
00:31:58,795 --> 00:32:00,796
He just kinda smells
good and makes me laugh.

735
00:32:00,864 --> 00:32:02,064
Why not cuddy?

736
00:32:02,132 --> 00:32:05,000
You never apologized after
you defaced her photo.

737
00:32:05,068 --> 00:32:06,235
Maybe because I recognize

738
00:32:06,303 --> 00:32:07,636
That sending someone to the poor house

739
00:32:07,704 --> 00:32:10,439
Is a little more serious
than editing a snapshot.

740
00:32:10,507 --> 00:32:12,875
No, it's because cuddy actually
means something to you,

741
00:32:12,943 --> 00:32:13,809
Which makes it much harder to apologize.

742
00:32:13,877 --> 00:32:16,512
Oy.

743
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,147
If it will make you shut up,

744
00:32:18,214 --> 00:32:19,281
I will tell her I'm sorry about the photo.

745
00:32:19,349 --> 00:32:20,849
Forget the photo.

746
00:32:20,917 --> 00:32:22,284
House, she was in love with you.

747
00:32:22,352 --> 00:32:23,852
And all she got in return was abuse.

748
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,188
For years you toyed with her emotions.

749
00:32:26,256 --> 00:32:28,157
She wasn't in love with me.

750
00:32:28,224 --> 00:32:29,291
<i>The fact that you still
can't admit it</i>

751
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:30,526
Just proves my point.

752
00:32:30,594 --> 00:32:33,362
What do you want?

753
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:35,397
Helping the guy was your idea.

754
00:32:35,465 --> 00:32:36,732
No, help the guy, whatever...

755
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,301
I'm just pointing out that it's much easier

756
00:32:39,369 --> 00:32:42,004
<i>To soothe your guilt by throwing money at a
stranger</i>

757
00:32:42,072 --> 00:32:43,372
<i>Than by making amends</i>

758
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,641
To a person you actually cared about.

759
00:32:45,709 --> 00:32:47,576
You had me at "much easier."

760
00:32:47,644 --> 00:32:49,445
<i>I'm gonna pretend</i>

761
00:32:49,512 --> 00:32:50,946
To go to work now.

762
00:32:54,684 --> 00:32:55,784
Bing!

763
00:33:17,607 --> 00:33:18,774
Sarah?

764
00:33:18,842 --> 00:33:21,644
I'm dr. Hadley.

765
00:33:21,711 --> 00:33:22,911
I'm--I'm sorry to bother you,

766
00:33:22,979 --> 00:33:25,914
But I was told you're valerie's sister?

767
00:33:25,982 --> 00:33:29,585
I was just surprised you came to visit.

768
00:33:29,653 --> 00:33:32,655
So is the rest of my family.

769
00:33:32,722 --> 00:33:35,090
I was even more surprised
you got tested as a donor.

770
00:33:35,158 --> 00:33:37,793
Wrong blood type. But why?

771
00:33:37,861 --> 00:33:39,795
I mean, you know what she's like.

772
00:33:39,863 --> 00:33:41,830
She's not that bad.

773
00:33:41,898 --> 00:33:44,500
Yes, she is.

774
00:33:47,971 --> 00:33:51,540
Our dad was a mean drunk.

775
00:33:51,608 --> 00:33:53,175
I was the older sister.

776
00:33:53,243 --> 00:33:54,910
I was supposed to stand up for her,

777
00:33:54,978 --> 00:33:57,579
Not the other way around.

778
00:33:57,647 --> 00:33:59,248
She protected you when you were kids?

779
00:33:59,315 --> 00:34:02,718
Yeah, and then all of the sudden...

780
00:34:02,786 --> 00:34:07,556
All of his crap and all his abuse...

781
00:34:07,624 --> 00:34:08,924
It just changed her.

782
00:34:08,992 --> 00:34:12,695
It made her cold.

783
00:34:12,762 --> 00:34:13,996
When?

784
00:34:18,468 --> 00:34:21,170
We were wrong. Psychopathy is a symptom.

785
00:34:21,237 --> 00:34:23,572
I spoke to her sister.
She wasn't always like this.

786
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,175
She changed, and right around adolescence.

787
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:32,614
So liver, heart, brain, can lie dormant,

788
00:34:32,682 --> 00:34:36,719
And it starts at puberty.

789
00:34:41,725 --> 00:34:44,426
The raw food diet made it go fulminant...

790
00:34:44,494 --> 00:34:46,428
Nuts are high in copper.

791
00:34:46,496 --> 00:34:49,565
It's wilson's disease.

792
00:34:49,632 --> 00:34:51,400
We ruled that out.
No keyser-fleischer rings.

793
00:34:51,468 --> 00:34:55,370
There is one other sign.

794
00:34:55,438 --> 00:34:57,973
I know there are lipstick lesbians.

795
00:34:58,041 --> 00:35:01,777
Are there nail polish remover bisexuals?

796
00:35:04,681 --> 00:35:06,081
She's not supposed to be here.

797
00:35:06,149 --> 00:35:07,616
As a doctor.

798
00:35:07,684 --> 00:35:09,485
<i>You didn't say anything
about her capacity</i>

799
00:35:09,552 --> 00:35:10,719
<i>As a beautician's assistant.</i>

800
00:35:26,102 --> 00:35:27,302
<i>Her fingernail's blue?</i>

801
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:28,737
<i>Yep.</i>

802
00:35:28,805 --> 00:35:31,807
Start her on chelation.

803
00:35:31,875 --> 00:35:33,208
What just happened?

804
00:35:33,276 --> 00:35:34,977
You're gonna get better.

805
00:35:35,044 --> 00:35:37,980
Your body has an inability
to process copper.

806
00:35:38,047 --> 00:35:40,215
It caused all of your problems.

807
00:35:40,283 --> 00:35:42,050
Even what's wrong with your brain.

808
00:35:42,118 --> 00:35:43,752
And that's gonna change too?

809
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:47,689
It's probably rewired her
neurons permanently by now.

810
00:35:47,757 --> 00:35:49,258
But it's possible?

811
00:35:49,325 --> 00:35:52,161
Maybe.

812
00:35:52,228 --> 00:35:54,363
I have to go get the chelation equipment.

813
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:56,365
Bill, I need you to sign some forms.

814
00:36:04,607 --> 00:36:06,475
You don't see what she's doing?

815
00:36:06,543 --> 00:36:09,812
She's laying the groundwork
to get her treatment,

816
00:36:09,879 --> 00:36:11,747
Wake up a completely different person,

817
00:36:11,815 --> 00:36:14,216
So that you and all of your money

818
00:36:14,284 --> 00:36:15,450
Stay with her.

819
00:36:15,518 --> 00:36:17,886
It's a lie.

820
00:36:17,954 --> 00:36:20,255
You said there was a chance.

821
00:36:20,323 --> 00:36:22,658
Okay, there's a teeny chance.

822
00:36:22,725 --> 00:36:24,626
But even if it cures her,

823
00:36:24,694 --> 00:36:26,628
It's not going to make her love you.

824
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,867
I was happy before...

825
00:36:31,935 --> 00:36:33,535
I know.

826
00:36:33,603 --> 00:36:35,604
And I'm sorry,

827
00:36:35,672 --> 00:36:39,575
But it wasn't real.

828
00:36:39,642 --> 00:36:40,843
It felt real.

829
00:36:45,248 --> 00:36:47,216
I don't know...

830
00:36:47,283 --> 00:36:51,086
Maybe that can be enough.

831
00:37:00,793 --> 00:37:03,896
you're really doing this for me?

832
00:37:05,263 --> 00:37:08,933
Tax shelter.

833
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,601
I'll take some of that chili now.

834
00:37:16,908 --> 00:37:18,709
I can't accept this. Fine.

835
00:37:18,777 --> 00:37:20,644
Forget the chili.

836
00:37:20,712 --> 00:37:21,779
Bye, wibberly.

837
00:37:23,048 --> 00:37:25,616
I got an "a"-plus with your paper.

838
00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:30,254
I was an orthopedic surgeon

839
00:37:30,322 --> 00:37:32,189
For ten years at new york mercy.

840
00:37:32,257 --> 00:37:34,458
<i>I had a gambling problem.</i>

841
00:37:34,526 --> 00:37:35,593
<i>I tried to cover it</i>

842
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,261
By over-billing some medicare patients.

843
00:37:37,329 --> 00:37:38,529
Lost my license.

844
00:37:38,597 --> 00:37:40,798
<i>That's why I'm here.</i>

845
00:37:40,866 --> 00:37:42,600
<i>Not because of you.</i>

846
00:37:42,667 --> 00:37:44,501
Why are you telling me this now?

847
00:37:44,569 --> 00:37:48,973
Because I thought you'd be the same bastard

848
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,876
You were in med school, but, uh...

849
00:38:03,722 --> 00:38:04,989
Keep it.

850
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:07,057
No, I can get another place.

851
00:38:07,125 --> 00:38:08,325
Just take it.

852
00:38:08,393 --> 00:38:09,693
I screwed you over.

853
00:38:09,761 --> 00:38:10,961
You got me an "a"-plus.

854
00:38:11,029 --> 00:38:12,763
Take it. No!

855
00:38:12,831 --> 00:38:14,431
Do I have to shove it down your throat?

856
00:38:14,499 --> 00:38:15,966
Take the damn check!

857
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,794
Your vitals are up.

858
00:38:47,365 --> 00:38:49,333
Treatment's working?

859
00:38:49,401 --> 00:38:51,168
I'm not sure we can fix
your liver, but we can

860
00:38:51,236 --> 00:38:53,804
<i>Definitely list you for a new one.</i>

861
00:38:53,872 --> 00:38:55,205
When you're better,

862
00:38:55,273 --> 00:38:57,408
We're gonna take a long vacation.

863
00:38:57,475 --> 00:38:58,976
You wanna go to vietnam, one of the beaches,

864
00:38:59,044 --> 00:39:00,177
We're gonna get a hut.

865
00:39:00,245 --> 00:39:03,847
Just you and me, nothing to worry about.

866
00:39:07,118 --> 00:39:08,352
You're pathetic.

867
00:39:12,424 --> 00:39:14,024
Wha--what?

868
00:39:14,092 --> 00:39:15,993
<i>I mean, when you had a suspicion,
fine.</i>

869
00:39:16,061 --> 00:39:18,028
But you know now.

870
00:39:18,096 --> 00:39:20,998
How can you be this pitiful?

871
00:39:21,066 --> 00:39:23,100
You don't mean this.

872
00:39:23,168 --> 00:39:24,435
You're sick.

873
00:39:24,502 --> 00:39:26,570
I'm not sick.

874
00:39:26,638 --> 00:39:28,973
I almost died and I still might.

875
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,841
<i>And who knows, maybe it's
focusing my mind</i>

876
00:39:30,909 --> 00:39:33,210
Because the idea of spending
the rest of my life with you--

877
00:39:33,278 --> 00:39:34,945
Valerie...

878
00:39:52,597 --> 00:39:53,931
Why did you do that?

879
00:39:53,999 --> 00:39:56,166
Because he's pathetic.

880
00:39:56,234 --> 00:39:58,268
He hasn't changed...

881
00:40:02,807 --> 00:40:04,174
But you have.

882
00:40:04,242 --> 00:40:07,711
The treatment actually worked on your brain.

883
00:40:07,779 --> 00:40:09,413
If you were still a psychopath,

884
00:40:09,481 --> 00:40:10,848
You would've just kept draining him dry.

885
00:40:10,915 --> 00:40:12,616
What do you want? You're feeling something.

886
00:40:12,684 --> 00:40:15,786
What is it?

887
00:40:15,854 --> 00:40:17,721
What do you feel?

888
00:40:21,826 --> 00:40:24,528
I don't know.

889
00:40:26,164 --> 00:40:28,198
It hurts.

890
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,107
It will.

891
00:40:53,658 --> 00:40:55,759
Heard about the diagnosis.

892
00:40:55,827 --> 00:40:57,194
Nice job.

893
00:40:57,262 --> 00:40:59,029
Thanks.

894
00:40:59,097 --> 00:41:00,397
Why are you here so late?

895
00:41:00,465 --> 00:41:02,599
Discharge summary.

896
00:41:02,667 --> 00:41:05,235
Taub's handwriting isn't helping much.

897
00:41:05,303 --> 00:41:06,804
Apparently on the third day of admission,

898
00:41:06,871 --> 00:41:09,673
