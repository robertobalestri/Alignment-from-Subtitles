1
00:00:00,969 --> 00:00:02,268
Previously on The Resident...

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:05,205
Nicolette Marie Nevin,

3
00:00:05,207 --> 00:00:07,008
will you do me the honor...

4
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:08,796
He's one of a kind, isn't he?

5
00:00:08,798 --> 00:00:10,039
Yeah.

6
00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:11,322
Our relationship...

7
00:00:11,324 --> 00:00:13,662
it is perfect just like this.

8
00:00:13,664 --> 00:00:14,844
My father owns his own cab.

9
00:00:14,846 --> 00:00:16,327
He put me through medical school

10
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:17,580
working very long hours,

11
00:00:17,582 --> 00:00:18,863
and I'm very proud of him.

12
00:00:18,865 --> 00:00:20,757
So, y-you think this place
in Savannah...

13
00:00:20,759 --> 00:00:22,340
you really think they can help me?

14
00:00:22,342 --> 00:00:24,427
It's one of the best inpatient
centers in the country.

15
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:26,370
I really want to be there
for all those moments

16
00:00:26,372 --> 00:00:28,377
- that you talked about.
- Me too.

17
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:29,878
Cain and Bell had their chance

18
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,121
to be the star of this company,

19
00:00:31,123 --> 00:00:32,260
but they couldn't deliver.

20
00:00:32,262 --> 00:00:33,653
Our future is brighter

21
00:00:33,655 --> 00:00:35,955
with Conrad Hawkins front and center.

22
00:00:37,336 --> 00:00:43,537
_

23
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:45,539
I don't know.

24
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:48,747
I'm still jonesing for
that powder blue tux

25
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:51,377
with the ruffled shirt.

26
00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:53,917
No, no, no, no, no, you
are not allowed to look

27
00:00:53,919 --> 00:00:56,177
like a lounge singer
on your wedding day.

28
00:00:56,179 --> 00:00:59,717
Seriously... thoughts?

29
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:01,967
You fishing for compliments?

30
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:04,137
Come on.

31
00:01:04,139 --> 00:01:05,649
Okay.

32
00:01:11,389 --> 00:01:13,387
Baller.

33
00:01:13,389 --> 00:01:15,487
Slightly different guy
than that jerk you met

34
00:01:15,489 --> 00:01:17,237
your first day of residency.

35
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:19,487
You were just doing your job
the wrong way.

36
00:01:19,489 --> 00:01:21,377
I must've done something right.

37
00:01:21,379 --> 00:01:23,449
You turned into a damn fine doctor.

38
00:01:25,749 --> 00:01:31,229
Yeah, well, it... hasn't
always felt that way.

39
00:01:33,419 --> 00:01:35,107
When all hell breaks loose,

40
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:36,717
you find out what people are made of.

41
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:38,089
You excelled.

42
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:43,297
That's very kind of you,
but let's stick to you.

43
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:44,507
How you feeling?

44
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:47,397
Any last-minute jitters?

45
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,757
None.

46
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,737
I'm as happy as I've ever been.

47
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:55,529
I'm about to marry my soul mate.

48
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:59,979
Okay, last stitch.

49
00:02:01,269 --> 00:02:04,457
Something borrowed and something blue.

50
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:05,620
It's a twofer.

51
00:02:05,622 --> 00:02:07,711
Those earrings are beautiful.

52
00:02:07,713 --> 00:02:08,976
Whose are they?

53
00:02:08,978 --> 00:02:11,247
They were Jessie's.

54
00:02:11,249 --> 00:02:13,549
My dad bought them
for her 16th birthday.

55
00:02:15,619 --> 00:02:17,537
I wish she were here.

56
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:19,467
Me, too.

57
00:02:19,469 --> 00:02:21,787
But she's always with me.

58
00:02:21,789 --> 00:02:24,577
- So is my mom.
- Hmm.

59
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:28,847
And now you get to wear her circa-1980

60
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:30,887
wedding dress.

61
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:34,287
When my dad begged me
to wear it, my heart sank.

62
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:36,837
Luckily you have Mina.

63
00:02:36,839 --> 00:02:37,967
Something old is now new.

64
00:02:37,969 --> 00:02:41,477
I mean, you're a miracle worker.

65
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,687
- Thank you.
- Of course.

66
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:47,607
Is it bad to be this happy after
everything that's happened?

67
00:02:47,609 --> 00:02:49,877
No,

68
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:54,247
but I wish things had been different,

69
00:02:54,249 --> 00:02:57,987
that we could all be
here together today.

70
00:02:57,989 --> 00:02:59,827
Yeah.

71
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:05,477
2020, man, what a year.

72
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:08,347
I mean, we had no idea
what was about to hit us.

73
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:15,644
_

74
00:03:15,646 --> 00:03:17,925
Okay, since the service is outside,

75
00:03:17,927 --> 00:03:20,010
I was thinking, instead
of throwing rice,

76
00:03:20,012 --> 00:03:21,490
people could throw birdseeds?

77
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:24,300
Environmentally conscious... I like it.

78
00:03:25,893 --> 00:03:27,781
Okay, how do you feel about a buffet

79
00:03:27,783 --> 00:03:29,401
instead of a seated dinner?

80
00:03:29,403 --> 00:03:31,401
I feel nothing.

81
00:03:31,403 --> 00:03:32,681
Defer.

82
00:03:32,683 --> 00:03:34,521
Band or DJ?

83
00:03:34,523 --> 00:03:35,681
Up to you.

84
00:03:35,683 --> 00:03:37,431
Oh, my God, we're bad at this.

85
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:38,711
Okay, I'm going DJ.

86
00:03:38,713 --> 00:03:40,062
All right.

87
00:03:40,064 --> 00:03:42,261
And I think I want burgundy flowers.

88
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:45,271
Dahlias, peonies.

89
00:03:45,273 --> 00:03:48,522
Really? I was hoping
for blue wildflowers.

90
00:03:48,524 --> 00:03:50,143
You don't care what music we play

91
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:52,371
and yet you have an opinion
on the color of my bouquet?

92
00:03:52,373 --> 00:03:55,461
Remember that first date we
had, hiking at Sweetwater?

93
00:03:55,463 --> 00:03:58,421
The flowers I picked for you that day?

94
00:03:58,423 --> 00:04:00,951
Blue wildflowers it is.

95
00:04:00,953 --> 00:04:02,720
And whatever DJ you decide on,

96
00:04:02,722 --> 00:04:04,881
they have to play "Mr. Brightside".

97
00:04:04,883 --> 00:04:07,431
You asked.

98
00:04:07,433 --> 00:04:09,282
I thought you had
better taste than that.

99
00:04:09,284 --> 00:04:11,562
Oh, you're about to be
Mrs. Conrad Hawkins.

100
00:04:11,564 --> 00:04:12,816
We both should have better taste.

101
00:04:12,818 --> 00:04:15,807
I'm pretty sure you're
about to be Mr. Nic Nevin.

102
00:04:22,485 --> 00:04:24,204
Okafor.

103
00:04:24,206 --> 00:04:27,069
Quadruple bypass in an
hour. Get your game on.

104
00:04:27,071 --> 00:04:29,100
My game is always on.

105
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,885
That's what I love about you.

106
00:04:30,887 --> 00:04:31,986
Andrea.

107
00:04:31,988 --> 00:04:33,687
Mon chéri.

108
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:35,848
Yeah, I will be picking you up at 8:00

109
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:39,131
for Chateaubriand at Chez Pierre.

110
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:43,342
Do not dis my French accent.

111
00:04:43,344 --> 00:04:45,161
I loathe the in-love Raptor.

112
00:04:45,163 --> 00:04:47,501
Maybe you should ask yourself why.

113
00:04:47,503 --> 00:04:49,641
Transition team to OR Four.

114
00:04:49,643 --> 00:04:51,981
Transition team to OR Four.

115
00:04:51,983 --> 00:04:53,491
Look who it is.

116
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,472
The new face of the hospital.

117
00:04:55,474 --> 00:04:57,151
Not.

118
00:04:57,153 --> 00:04:59,341
Why is Barrett Cain's
mug still up there?

119
00:04:59,343 --> 00:05:00,941
Randolph Bell, Barrett Cain,

120
00:05:00,943 --> 00:05:02,712
then Conrad Hawkins?

121
00:05:02,714 --> 00:05:05,060
Hard pass, thank you very much.

122
00:05:06,103 --> 00:05:07,574
Hey, do you have time
for a quick consult?

123
00:05:07,576 --> 00:05:08,595
Sure.

124
00:05:08,597 --> 00:05:11,041
Bay One, Carter Wiggins, 34.

125
00:05:11,043 --> 00:05:13,772
Headache, febrile and fatigue.

126
00:05:13,774 --> 00:05:15,283
Take a look at his hands over here.

127
00:05:15,285 --> 00:05:16,474
Hello, Mr. Wiggins.

128
00:05:16,476 --> 00:05:17,565
I'm Dr. Hawkins.

129
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,926
Sounds like you're feeling lousy.

130
00:05:18,928 --> 00:05:21,016
So these, um, red lesions are new.

131
00:05:21,018 --> 00:05:23,511
And my nose is all stopped up.

132
00:05:23,513 --> 00:05:24,692
Can't smell my pies,

133
00:05:24,694 --> 00:05:27,011
even the pineapple and pepperoni.

134
00:05:27,013 --> 00:05:29,015
Can't believe you went to work today.

135
00:05:29,017 --> 00:05:30,516
Your mama would be angry.

136
00:05:30,518 --> 00:05:33,038
Temp is up to 102.5.

137
00:05:33,898 --> 00:05:35,606
Have you traveled anywhere recently?

138
00:05:35,608 --> 00:05:37,416
Uh, Seattle.

139
00:05:37,418 --> 00:05:40,046
To see my grandmother.

140
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,528
Okay, we'll be right back.

141
00:05:48,538 --> 00:05:51,248
How many cases of COVID-19 in Seattle?

142
00:05:54,603 --> 00:05:56,932
14 known so far, five deaths.

143
00:05:56,934 --> 00:05:59,143
The symptoms fit.

144
00:05:59,145 --> 00:06:01,215
I think we have our
first case of coronavirus.

145
00:06:03,548 --> 00:06:05,657
We need a crash cart!

146
00:06:05,659 --> 00:06:06,859
I've lost his pulse.

147
00:06:08,592 --> 00:06:11,392
Hundley, stop! You need PPE.

_

150
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:53,327
Just got a text.

151
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:56,006
They can't refund the deposit
for the wedding venue.

152
00:06:56,008 --> 00:06:57,386
Someday this will be over

153
00:06:57,388 --> 00:06:59,516
and we will have a beautiful wedding.

154
00:06:59,518 --> 00:07:01,818
It seems petty to even
be talking about that.

155
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,290
No, it's not petty.

156
00:07:04,608 --> 00:07:06,848
Just want everyone to
get to that day safely.

157
00:07:23,258 --> 00:07:25,776
You guys, I've got Hundley on speaker.

158
00:07:27,338 --> 00:07:29,806
Hey, Hundley, it's Devon.
What's your O2 sat?

159
00:07:29,808 --> 00:07:31,866
90. But don't worry.

160
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:35,186
I just had... a coughing fit,

161
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:37,096
so it'll come back up.

162
00:07:40,968 --> 00:07:42,146
Mom, are you okay?

163
00:07:42,148 --> 00:07:44,515
Mom, I'm coming in.

164
00:07:44,517 --> 00:07:45,766
No, you're not, honey!

165
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:48,288
Mom!

166
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,826
Is there anything we can do?

167
00:07:49,828 --> 00:07:51,196
Don't,

168
00:07:51,198 --> 00:07:53,326
don't worry about me.

169
00:07:53,328 --> 00:07:55,186
Not possible. You should come in.

170
00:07:55,188 --> 00:07:57,728
I'll know if the time comes

171
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:58,869
when I need you.

172
00:08:04,048 --> 00:08:05,487
Mom, I'm getting scared.

173
00:08:05,489 --> 00:08:06,866
Please come unlock the door.

174
00:08:10,548 --> 00:08:11,807
Don't come in.

175
00:08:11,809 --> 00:08:13,336
Okay, I'm-I'm officially worried.

176
00:08:13,338 --> 00:08:14,516
Seriously.

177
00:08:14,518 --> 00:08:16,116
This is day five of the same mask.

178
00:08:16,118 --> 00:08:17,226
Can you check my seal?

179
00:08:17,228 --> 00:08:18,228
Yep.

180
00:08:21,303 --> 00:08:22,303
Seal's holding.

181
00:08:26,858 --> 00:08:29,077
You ready?

182
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,089
Let's go.

183
00:08:33,645 --> 00:08:35,894
I don't think I ever realized
how many of our surgeries

184
00:08:35,896 --> 00:08:37,175
are actually elective.

185
00:08:37,177 --> 00:08:38,916
I have patients who need operations

186
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,057
who won't come in.

187
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:41,668
They're worried it's not safe.

188
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:43,389
You know, I've never felt

189
00:08:43,391 --> 00:08:44,805
quite so useless.

190
00:08:44,807 --> 00:08:46,196
So what do we do?

191
00:08:46,198 --> 00:08:48,376
Well, I'd say we join the front lines.

192
00:08:48,378 --> 00:08:50,067
Mina's been in the ER all week.

193
00:08:50,069 --> 00:08:51,997
- Same as Kit, in the ICU.
- Well, that's all well and good,

194
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:53,746
except I got this
preexisting condition...

195
00:08:53,748 --> 00:08:56,226
Cowardice?

196
00:08:56,228 --> 00:08:58,226
Time to put on the big boy pants, Nolan.

197
00:08:58,228 --> 00:09:00,308
We got work to do, baby.

198
00:09:03,898 --> 00:09:05,106
C-Can he hear us?

199
00:09:05,108 --> 00:09:06,936
I believe so.

200
00:09:06,938 --> 00:09:09,146
Say whatever you have to say now;

201
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:10,556
it won't be much longer.

202
00:09:10,558 --> 00:09:12,858
We will be here long as it takes.

203
00:09:15,078 --> 00:09:16,508
He can't die alone.

204
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,998
I'll give you some privacy.

205
00:10:20,975 --> 00:10:22,685
_

206
00:10:27,186 --> 00:10:29,186
_

207
00:10:37,158 --> 00:10:38,564
Dr. Bell!

208
00:10:38,566 --> 00:10:39,681
Dr. Bell.

209
00:10:39,683 --> 00:10:41,342
His sat is stuck in the 70s.

210
00:10:41,344 --> 00:10:42,424
What do you need?

211
00:11:03,678 --> 00:11:05,676
Hey.

212
00:11:05,678 --> 00:11:07,136
What's going on?

213
00:11:07,138 --> 00:11:09,096
Everything.

214
00:11:09,098 --> 00:11:10,606
I feel so helpless.

215
00:11:10,608 --> 00:11:13,506
We're surgeons. We cut, we fix.

216
00:11:13,508 --> 00:11:15,736
With this disease, there's
so little we can do.

217
00:11:15,738 --> 00:11:19,122
Just hold their hands and support them.

218
00:11:19,124 --> 00:11:21,783
And too many are dying
in these rooms, alone.

219
00:11:21,785 --> 00:11:24,593
You should go home. You're exhausted.

220
00:11:24,595 --> 00:11:26,084
You should.

221
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:28,093
It's too dangerous for you here.

222
00:11:28,095 --> 00:11:30,893
People over 65 are most at risk.

223
00:11:30,895 --> 00:11:32,843
I'm 60.

224
00:11:32,845 --> 00:11:35,383
Roughly.

225
00:11:35,385 --> 00:11:37,683
I'm fit. I run marathons.

226
00:11:37,685 --> 00:11:39,393
That's Pete.

227
00:11:39,395 --> 00:11:41,403
He's a tennis pro,

228
00:11:41,405 --> 00:11:44,861
now with myocarditis
as a result of this virus.

229
00:11:44,863 --> 00:11:46,892
He's 33 and he might die.

230
00:11:46,894 --> 00:11:49,063
Fit won't save you.

231
00:11:49,065 --> 00:11:50,455
Well, I'm staying.

232
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,075
Hundley just pulled in.

233
00:11:55,077 --> 00:11:57,297
She's not doing well. She drove herself.

234
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,095
Hundley!

235
00:12:19,097 --> 00:12:20,327
Hundley, hang on!

236
00:12:33,187 --> 00:12:36,525
- We've got Hundley!
- Put her in Bay Three.

237
00:12:36,527 --> 00:12:38,997
Sat 78, pulse 150 and climbing.

238
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:40,138
I'll start an IV.

239
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,626
Mina, she needs oxygen.

240
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:43,387
Get her started on a non-rebreather.

241
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:46,619
And 500cc's of saline.

242
00:12:56,957 --> 00:12:58,025
You got this.

243
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,657
We got this.

244
00:13:02,912 --> 00:13:04,122
Here you go.

245
00:13:05,307 --> 00:13:07,355
All right?

246
00:13:07,357 --> 00:13:08,665
Temp is 102.6.

247
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:11,335
Okay, her sats are rising. 92.

248
00:13:11,337 --> 00:13:13,874
- 94.
- Oxygen's helping.

249
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,125
Don't intubate if you can avoid it.

250
00:13:16,127 --> 00:13:18,955
I need to stay awake
for Raylee. Promise.

251
00:13:18,957 --> 00:13:20,975
We're gonna do everything
we can to take care of you.

252
00:13:20,977 --> 00:13:22,056
Mom!

253
00:13:22,058 --> 00:13:23,517
Oh, oh, my baby.

254
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,538
Send her home where she's safe.

255
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,892
- Get her out of here.
- I will. I promise.

256
00:13:27,894 --> 00:13:30,602
Hundley, we need to admit you,

257
00:13:30,604 --> 00:13:32,252
get you to the ICU, okay?

258
00:13:32,254 --> 00:13:33,823
I'm putting in the orders now.

259
00:13:33,825 --> 00:13:35,422
Checking for available beds.

260
00:13:35,424 --> 00:13:36,694
Hang in there.

261
00:13:38,114 --> 00:13:40,613
Nic, please. She wouldn't
even let me drive her here.

262
00:13:40,615 --> 00:13:42,122
I have to see her.

263
00:13:42,124 --> 00:13:43,662
Raylee, we can't have visitors

264
00:13:43,664 --> 00:13:45,092
- in the hospital right now.
- Please.

265
00:13:45,094 --> 00:13:46,193
You know my mom.

266
00:13:46,195 --> 00:13:47,757
She's there for me when I'm sick.

267
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:48,998
I can't just leave.

268
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,232
Listen, first off all,
are you feeling okay?

269
00:13:51,234 --> 00:13:54,222
Good. So, your mom wants
you to go home and isolate.

270
00:13:54,224 --> 00:13:55,722
Take care of yourself,
and I will call you

271
00:13:55,724 --> 00:13:57,182
as soon as she's settled, okay?

272
00:13:57,184 --> 00:13:59,364
I'm so sorry.

273
00:14:05,024 --> 00:14:06,782
We're bleeding money.

274
00:14:06,784 --> 00:14:09,163
Down $400 million in a single month.

275
00:14:09,165 --> 00:14:11,828
Uh, you hold the fate of
the hospital in your hands.

276
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:14,331
Red Rock needs you
to start cutting again.

277
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,108
Can't cut. Everyone's afraid.

278
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,239
Especially the sickest people

279
00:14:17,241 --> 00:14:18,640
who need the operations the most.

280
00:14:18,642 --> 00:14:19,891
They're afraid COVID is gonna kill them.

281
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:21,922
Then-then focus on elective surgeries.

282
00:14:21,924 --> 00:14:25,253
Stents, uh, knee replacements,
disc repair, uh, plastics.

283
00:14:25,255 --> 00:14:27,018
It's against CMS guidelines.

284
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,318
Elective surgeries use precious PPE,

285
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,892
hospital beds and resources.

286
00:14:30,894 --> 00:14:33,003
We don't have a
multibillion-dollar endowment

287
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:35,268
like the Mayo Clinic.
I have to make payroll.

288
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,858
D-Do you understand that
this hospital will close?

289
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,315
- Thousands of jobs are at stake.
- Yeah, but the only job

290
00:14:40,317 --> 00:14:41,978
you're worried about is your own, Kim.

291
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,488
- That's not true.
- Really?

292
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:46,078
I-I know we haven't always
been on the same side,

293
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,826
but we need to work together this time.

294
00:14:47,828 --> 00:14:49,389
There's a government bailout coming.

295
00:14:49,391 --> 00:14:52,768
- Where will that money go?
- Red Rock's bank account.

296
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:55,020
Yeah. We're done here.

297
00:14:57,941 --> 00:14:58,941
B-Barrett.

298
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,548
You're the chief of
surgery. My rainmaker.

299
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:06,048
I... Help me to save Chastain.

300
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,988
Take the lowest-risk elective surgeries

301
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,768
and-and schedule them as urgent.

302
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:13,238
Okay, on one condition.

303
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,726
Don't ever threaten my job
again or replace my face

304
00:15:16,728 --> 00:15:20,088
on the side of this building
with a shiny new object.

305
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,730
Deal.

306
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,278
Dr. Cain?

307
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,038
Is there something wrong?

308
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,648
I'm afraid so.

309
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:48,049
Listen, I know that I told you

310
00:15:48,051 --> 00:15:49,710
your back surgery could wait, Ben,

311
00:15:49,712 --> 00:15:53,532
but I took another look at
your last scan this morning.

312
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,788
Is there a problem?

313
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,793
Yes. I see some progression

314
00:15:57,795 --> 00:16:01,340
in your disc herniation
at your L5-S1 vertebrae

315
00:16:01,342 --> 00:16:03,840
with some potential involvement
of your spinal cord.

316
00:16:03,842 --> 00:16:07,150
- My spinal cord?
- Yes, yes, and it's getting worse.

317
00:16:07,152 --> 00:16:09,730
I need to get you into
the OR immediately.

318
00:16:09,732 --> 00:16:12,151
But it's not safe at the hospital.

319
00:16:12,153 --> 00:16:15,152
- The coronavirus is...
- Oh, no, our surgical facilities are pristine.

320
00:16:15,154 --> 00:16:17,213
Yeah, never been cleaner or safer.

321
00:16:17,215 --> 00:16:19,164
And you won't be anywhere
near a COVID patient.

322
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,635
We'll take every precaution.

323
00:16:23,038 --> 00:16:27,080
I don't know. Um, I
have to think about this.

324
00:16:27,082 --> 00:16:30,530
See, here's the thing, Ben,

325
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:33,700
if you put this off,
you take one bad step,

326
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:35,682
you slip and fall in the bathroom...

327
00:16:36,722 --> 00:16:38,560
... you'll end up paralyzed.

328
00:16:38,562 --> 00:16:41,380
Oh, my God, Dr. Cain.

329
00:16:45,112 --> 00:16:47,880
Okay.

330
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:49,322
I'll do whatever you say.

331
00:17:00,732 --> 00:17:01,990
Devon?

332
00:17:01,992 --> 00:17:03,742
How are you?

333
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:07,000
Are you driving your cab again?

334
00:17:07,002 --> 00:17:08,530
That's one of the riskiest
things you could do.

335
00:17:08,532 --> 00:17:10,071
You promised me you'd stay home.

336
00:17:10,073 --> 00:17:12,790
- And who is going to pay my rent, Devon?
- I will.

337
00:17:12,792 --> 00:17:15,790
Listen, Dad, our ER is
packed. Our ICU, too.

338
00:17:15,792 --> 00:17:17,681
Think about Mom. You could get infected,

339
00:17:17,683 --> 00:17:19,504
you could take it home
to her, she could die.

340
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:20,515
You both could.

341
00:17:20,517 --> 00:17:23,686
I need you to turn that cab
around and go home now.

342
00:17:23,688 --> 00:17:26,337
Dad, you need to leave the
facility and quarantine now.

343
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:28,358
It's really not a good
time, Nicky. I'm only...

344
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,283
- I'm halfway through treatment. If I leave...
- I know,

345
00:17:30,285 --> 00:17:32,756
but I wouldn't be asking
if it wasn't serious.

346
00:17:32,758 --> 00:17:34,577
Please. I'll get you a hotel room.

347
00:17:34,579 --> 00:17:35,869
Just tell me you'll do this.

348
00:17:38,862 --> 00:17:41,940
Yeah, okay. Okay, okay. Uh...

349
00:17:41,942 --> 00:17:44,120
Anything for you, Nicky.

350
00:17:44,122 --> 00:17:45,912
Okay.

351
00:17:47,081 --> 00:17:49,160
Dad, where are you?

352
00:17:49,162 --> 00:17:52,241
I finally got a guy who's
willing to manufacture

353
00:17:52,243 --> 00:17:54,056
the new mask prototypes,

354
00:17:54,058 --> 00:17:57,273
but now he is telling me that
there are no more materials.

355
00:17:57,275 --> 00:18:01,024
You have Crohn's disease and
a compromised immune system.

356
00:18:01,026 --> 00:18:03,065
We agreed that you were
gonna work from home.

357
00:18:03,067 --> 00:18:05,604
Hear my voice. This is
me not happy with you.

358
00:18:05,606 --> 00:18:07,484
You need to solve this issue from home.

359
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:09,034
As soon as I'm finished here.

360
00:18:09,036 --> 00:18:11,046
Hello?

361
00:18:15,796 --> 00:18:19,056
This is Marshall Winthrop. Unfort...

362
00:18:27,056 --> 00:18:30,564
Hey, you, nurse. I've been
waiting for two hours.

363
00:18:30,566 --> 00:18:32,275
I got gold-plated insurance.

364
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,380
- The taxes I pay, I should be first in line.
- Hey, hey, hey.

365
00:18:34,382 --> 00:18:36,161
There's no special treatment in this ER.

366
00:18:36,163 --> 00:18:38,194
Put your mask up, six feet
apart or you're out of here.

367
00:18:38,196 --> 00:18:40,644
I am six feet apart.

368
00:18:40,646 --> 00:18:42,704
What are you trying to do,
set a world record for people

369
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:44,706
in an ER in the middle of a pandemic?

370
00:18:46,213 --> 00:18:48,382
I understand the male temptation

371
00:18:48,384 --> 00:18:49,844
to exaggerate length...

372
00:18:50,676 --> 00:18:52,795
... but you need to back up.

373
00:18:54,626 --> 00:18:56,704
What... Don't touch me!

374
00:18:56,706 --> 00:18:58,756
He's not six feet apart!

375
00:19:03,096 --> 00:19:05,964
We've got five minutes
before our next crisis.

376
00:19:05,966 --> 00:19:08,416
- It is crazy out there.
- And unsafe.

377
00:19:08,418 --> 00:19:10,003
I really wish you were back in the OR

378
00:19:10,005 --> 00:19:11,024
working as a scrub nurse.

379
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:12,856
I'm right where I want to be.

380
00:19:19,746 --> 00:19:21,826
I'm laying my head on
your shoulder right now.

381
00:19:24,766 --> 00:19:28,784
I'm holding you and
rocking you back and forth.

382
00:19:28,786 --> 00:19:30,746
Aw. Thank you.

383
00:19:48,093 --> 00:19:50,992
"Lower extremity weakness
and acute onset

384
00:19:50,994 --> 00:19:55,604
of bowel incontinence requiring
urgent operative management".

385
00:19:55,606 --> 00:19:59,696
Come on, he's a 58-year-old
with a simple bulging disc.

386
00:20:04,972 --> 00:20:07,801
We are in the midst of
the single most devastating

387
00:20:07,803 --> 00:20:10,284
public health crisis of our lifetimes.

388
00:20:10,286 --> 00:20:12,034
Barrett, you can't be doing surgeries

389
00:20:12,036 --> 00:20:13,155
that don't need to be done.

390
00:20:13,157 --> 00:20:15,774
You put a patient at
risk of getting COVID.

391
00:20:15,776 --> 00:20:18,634
20% of surgeries are unnecessary.

392
00:20:18,636 --> 00:20:20,254
I made a judgment call.

393
00:20:20,256 --> 00:20:24,556
And he won't get COVID
because my OR is spotless.

394
00:20:28,386 --> 00:20:31,974
You know, you had a chance
to do the right thing.

395
00:20:31,976 --> 00:20:35,144
Pitch in with the rest
of us and help, but no.

396
00:20:35,146 --> 00:20:38,465
You just followed Red
Rock's marching orders.

397
00:20:38,467 --> 00:20:40,184
I'm a neurosurgeon. I cut.

398
00:20:40,186 --> 00:20:43,494
When that pandemic can
be cured by brain surgery,

399
00:20:43,496 --> 00:20:45,826
shoot me a page.

400
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:53,664
It's okay, Raylee.

401
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:58,794
If you get a fever
or cough, don't panic.

402
00:20:58,796 --> 00:21:03,464
Most people don't get this sick.

403
00:21:03,466 --> 00:21:05,624
You're gonna be okay.

404
00:21:05,626 --> 00:21:08,494
My doctors are here.

405
00:21:08,496 --> 00:21:10,234
I'll call you back soon.

406
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:12,165
- I love you.
- I love you, Mom.

407
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:14,083
Hey, there.

408
00:21:15,896 --> 00:21:19,572
Proning isn't working, is it?

409
00:21:19,574 --> 00:21:22,133
Well, your O2 sats
are still dipping too low,

410
00:21:22,135 --> 00:21:24,511
so we're gonna try a
high-flow nasal cannula now.

411
00:21:24,513 --> 00:21:26,221
It is a little outside the box,

412
00:21:26,223 --> 00:21:30,001
but otherwise we have to intubate.

413
00:21:30,003 --> 00:21:35,094
If you put me to sleep
and put that tube in,

414
00:21:35,096 --> 00:21:38,446
there's a good chance
I won't wake up again.

415
00:21:41,293 --> 00:21:43,893
Which is why high-flow
is worth the risk.

416
00:21:53,983 --> 00:21:56,021
Okay.

417
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,691
On three. One, two, three.

418
00:22:08,743 --> 00:22:13,102
Uh-oh, we disconnected something.

419
00:22:13,104 --> 00:22:15,533
- Where do these go?
- Haven't a clue.

420
00:22:15,535 --> 00:22:17,414
White electrode...

421
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:20,785
under right clavicle.

422
00:22:20,787 --> 00:22:23,391
Black under left.

423
00:22:23,393 --> 00:22:27,681
Red above and left of umbilicus.

424
00:22:27,683 --> 00:22:29,322
What about the beeping?

425
00:22:29,324 --> 00:22:30,853
Just press "silence".

426
00:22:36,713 --> 00:22:39,191
Surgeons, huh?

427
00:22:39,193 --> 00:22:41,221
Nurses aren't paid enough.

428
00:22:41,223 --> 00:22:43,403
Tell me about it.

429
00:22:47,823 --> 00:22:50,163
You're gonna be okay.

430
00:23:23,712 --> 00:23:25,401
Snapped when I was in the room.

431
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:27,203
I thought I felt something.

432
00:23:30,426 --> 00:23:32,305
Europe, South Korea, China,

433
00:23:32,307 --> 00:23:34,339
they all have state-of-the-art
protection; look at this.

434
00:23:34,341 --> 00:23:35,684
Dr. Voss is a surgeon.

435
00:23:35,686 --> 00:23:37,395
Could have gone home 'cause
she doesn't have any patients,

436
00:23:37,397 --> 00:23:39,585
but she's working in the ICU,
and this is all that protected her

437
00:23:39,587 --> 00:23:43,107
from exposure to COVID-19.
She's been exposed.

438
00:23:43,109 --> 00:23:45,568
You are sending our
soldiers to face the enemy

439
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:47,125
without any armor.

440
00:23:47,127 --> 00:23:49,162
We have a top ER nurse in the ICU

441
00:23:49,164 --> 00:23:50,465
fighting for her life.

442
00:23:50,467 --> 00:23:53,955
Two transpo workers are dead.
Med students, residents,

443
00:23:53,957 --> 00:23:55,306
they're isolating from their families,

444
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:56,797
they're sick and alone,
and some of them may die.

445
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,001
Everybody is chasing the same shipments.

446
00:23:59,003 --> 00:24:00,705
I keep getting outbid
by other hospitals.

447
00:24:00,707 --> 00:24:02,666
You need to protect our
staff. That's your job.

448
00:24:02,668 --> 00:24:04,855
I feel your frustration. I-I do.

449
00:24:04,857 --> 00:24:06,826
My frustration? Why-why
don't you come down to my ER

450
00:24:06,828 --> 00:24:08,577
and share my frustration
instead of sitting

451
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:11,271
in your ivory tower doing nothing?!

452
00:24:11,273 --> 00:24:14,935
All of you think I don't care. I care.

453
00:24:14,937 --> 00:24:17,535
I can't escape this either.

454
00:24:17,537 --> 00:24:19,686
This morning, a woman, a total stranger,

455
00:24:19,688 --> 00:24:21,247
called me a bat eater.

456
00:24:21,249 --> 00:24:23,918
I'm sorry. That's terrible.

457
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,655
The "China Virus", the "Kung Flu".

458
00:24:26,657 --> 00:24:28,406
I was born in Savannah.

459
00:24:28,408 --> 00:24:31,385
This is being used to turn
us all against each other.

460
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:33,885
And yes, I am trying
to save this hospital.

461
00:24:33,887 --> 00:24:35,295
I'll-I'll bend the rules to do it,

462
00:24:35,297 --> 00:24:36,925
but do not think for one moment

463
00:24:36,927 --> 00:24:39,555
that this hasn't hit me hard.

464
00:24:39,557 --> 00:24:41,545
I am human.

465
00:24:41,547 --> 00:24:43,897
Prove it.

466
00:24:47,397 --> 00:24:49,187
Prove it.

467
00:24:57,197 --> 00:25:00,327
Yo. How you holding up?

468
00:25:02,537 --> 00:25:06,085
I don't know. It's
pretty rough in there.

469
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:08,935
I'm proud of you for working the ER;

470
00:25:08,937 --> 00:25:11,385
however, I need you in the OR.

471
00:25:11,387 --> 00:25:13,357
We have our first COVID trach.

472
00:25:15,502 --> 00:25:18,001
Sounds delightful.

473
00:25:19,774 --> 00:25:22,935
Well, seriously, you
could use the break.

474
00:25:22,937 --> 00:25:24,725
I'm worried about you.

475
00:25:24,727 --> 00:25:27,797
I'm worried about you, too.

476
00:25:32,757 --> 00:25:34,385
Okay.

477
00:25:34,387 --> 00:25:38,211
You know where to
find me if you need me.

478
00:25:38,213 --> 00:25:39,413
I certainly do.

479
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:49,805
The high-flow bought us time, but...

480
00:25:49,807 --> 00:25:53,585
your sat is 82% on 100% oxygen,

481
00:25:53,587 --> 00:25:56,045
and it is dropping.

482
00:25:56,047 --> 00:25:58,595
We need to intubate.

483
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:09,095
- Can you get Chu?
- He's on his way.

484
00:26:10,418 --> 00:26:14,345
Can you please tell
Raylee I love her again?

485
00:26:14,347 --> 00:26:18,518
You will tell her yourself
because you will wake up.

486
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,170
Now let us fight for you.

487
00:26:29,647 --> 00:26:32,837
I'm here, Hundley. I'm here.

488
00:26:34,576 --> 00:26:35,795
You're gonna be okay.

489
00:26:35,797 --> 00:26:39,007
We're here.

490
00:26:50,086 --> 00:26:51,815
We're gonna put you
to sleep now, my friend.

491
00:26:51,817 --> 00:26:56,367
Just relax. Just relax.

492
00:27:25,207 --> 00:27:28,897
- You haven't eaten all day.
- I can't eat.

493
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,565
Hundley's a single mom.

494
00:27:34,567 --> 00:27:36,264
I don't want to have to tell Raylee that

495
00:27:36,266 --> 00:27:37,926
she's never gonna see her mom again.

496
00:27:40,986 --> 00:27:43,365
She's around the same age you
were when you lost your mom,

497
00:27:43,367 --> 00:27:45,157
isn't she?

498
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:54,920
If you get COVID, I get COVID.

499
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:07,915
The good news is I
can smell that coffee.

500
00:28:07,917 --> 00:28:09,798
And I could taste that bread.

501
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,099
If it's my last meal,
I'm going out with carbs.

502
00:28:12,101 --> 00:28:14,171
Don't even say that.

503
00:28:16,797 --> 00:28:18,855
How's Kit?

504
00:28:18,857 --> 00:28:20,885
Her mask broke.

505
00:28:20,887 --> 00:28:23,317
She's been exposed.

506
00:28:25,227 --> 00:28:27,495
I told her to go home.

507
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:29,997
She's scared.

508
00:28:39,127 --> 00:28:42,752
You'd rather wear a PAPR
than shave your beard.

509
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:46,013
You know how long it takes
to grow this beard out?

510
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:47,724
You know we have a
limited number of these?

511
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,334
They're for people who can't wear N95s

512
00:28:49,336 --> 00:28:51,053
because of the way
their faces are shaped,

513
00:28:51,055 --> 00:28:52,626
or because they have a religious

514
00:28:52,628 --> 00:28:54,161
objection to shaving their beards.

515
00:28:54,163 --> 00:28:56,704
Yeah, well, let's just say I
do have a religious objection.

516
00:28:56,706 --> 00:28:58,345
I worship this beard, all right?

517
00:28:58,347 --> 00:29:01,459
Well, you certainly are
conceited as you are vain.

518
00:29:01,461 --> 00:29:02,760
Isn't it itchy?

519
00:29:02,762 --> 00:29:04,447
Not at all.

520
00:29:06,416 --> 00:29:08,955
- All right, let me help you.
- Aw, thanks.

521
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:10,665
Without the beard, I look too young.

522
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:12,665
It adds wisdom and gravitas,

523
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:15,097
- and it's reassuring to my patients.
- Mm.

524
00:29:20,337 --> 00:29:23,315
Well, you don't look reassuring to me.

525
00:29:23,317 --> 00:29:25,805
- You look like you're about to go into space.
- Ha-ha-ha-ha.

526
00:29:34,385 --> 00:29:35,565
It's working.

527
00:29:37,147 --> 00:29:40,527
Yeah, it is.

528
00:29:58,985 --> 00:30:00,984
Where did you get it?

529
00:30:00,986 --> 00:30:02,495
South Korea.

530
00:30:02,497 --> 00:30:04,788
My family still has relatives there.

531
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:06,907
I put in an emergency order,

532
00:30:06,909 --> 00:30:09,715
and it turns out this
shipment was on its way.

533
00:30:09,717 --> 00:30:12,599
It wasn't cheap getting
it diverted to Chastain.

534
00:30:12,601 --> 00:30:15,167
Wait, wait, wait. You said
Red Rock wouldn't pay.

535
00:30:15,169 --> 00:30:16,169
They won't.

536
00:30:17,217 --> 00:30:19,227
But they did.

537
00:30:24,957 --> 00:30:26,886
What happens when they find out?

538
00:30:26,888 --> 00:30:29,134
Could cost me my job.

539
00:30:29,136 --> 00:30:32,595
But for now, at least our
staff will be protected.

540
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:35,617
And I could sleep
a little better tonight.

541
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:08,535
You never looked better.

542
00:31:08,537 --> 00:31:10,356
You, too.

543
00:31:12,077 --> 00:31:13,808
Ready for the next shift?

544
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:15,769
Yeah. I'm ready.

545
00:31:15,771 --> 00:31:18,457
And we are not leaving Hundley.

546
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:23,335
Hey, Dad, it's me.
Just calling to check in

547
00:32:23,337 --> 00:32:24,525
and make sure you're not driving

548
00:32:24,527 --> 00:32:28,551
your cab anymore.

549
00:32:28,553 --> 00:32:30,092
One second, son.

550
00:32:30,094 --> 00:32:32,644
Dad, what's going on?

551
00:32:32,646 --> 00:32:34,175
Nothing.

552
00:32:34,177 --> 00:32:36,495
I think I have a little flu, that's all.

553
00:33:19,641 --> 00:33:21,330
Randolph...

554
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,607
I'm gonna need you to
cover my patients tomorrow.

555
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:27,460
I have a fever.

556
00:33:39,955 --> 00:33:42,693
Please give Nic all my love, and...

557
00:33:42,695 --> 00:33:44,525
tell her I'm sorry I couldn't stay.

558
00:33:45,535 --> 00:33:47,745
How is your mom doing?

559
00:33:48,795 --> 00:33:51,934
They were married 41 years.

560
00:33:51,936 --> 00:33:55,275
An arranged marriage
that worked, you know?

561
00:33:55,277 --> 00:33:58,217
This is the only thing that
could've separated them.

562
00:34:02,295 --> 00:34:04,793
Yeah.

563
00:34:04,795 --> 00:34:06,853
I have to go. Got to catch my plane.

564
00:34:06,855 --> 00:34:08,223

Welcome to the long-awaited

591
00:35:27,299 --> 00:35:29,307
Nic and Conrad wedding.

592
00:35:29,309 --> 00:35:32,219
We are all gathered here
today to celebrate the union

593
00:35:32,221 --> 00:35:34,195
of these two people we love.

594
00:35:34,197 --> 00:35:35,447
So, without further ado,

595
00:35:35,449 --> 00:35:38,535
I'll let Nic and Conrad
speak for themselves.

596
00:35:38,537 --> 00:35:39,985
I love you.

597
00:35:39,987 --> 00:35:41,407
I love you, too.

598
00:35:42,892 --> 00:35:45,851
Conrad and I wanted to take a moment

599
00:35:45,853 --> 00:35:49,405
to remember some friends
that are missing here today.

600
00:35:49,407 --> 00:35:51,717
People we worked with
for a very long time...

601
00:35:53,047 --> 00:35:56,387
... who sadly lost
their battle with COVID.

602
00:35:58,172 --> 00:35:59,822
George in transpo.

603
00:36:01,595 --> 00:36:02,845
Dr. Peterson.

604
00:36:04,057 --> 00:36:06,895
Peter who cleaned the ICU rooms.

605
00:36:06,897 --> 00:36:10,065
Lois from accounting.

606
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:13,065
They ate lunch together every day.

607
00:36:13,067 --> 00:36:15,277
I think she had a crush on him.

608
00:36:17,077 --> 00:36:19,965
We lost them both.

609
00:36:19,967 --> 00:36:22,574
We also want to send
love to our dear friend Devon,

610
00:36:22,576 --> 00:36:24,525
who was to be my best man.

611
00:36:24,527 --> 00:36:27,077
Devon...

612
00:36:29,757 --> 00:36:31,667
... lost his father to COVID-19...

613
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,930
... and he almost lost his mother.

614
00:36:36,877 --> 00:36:39,785
He's on his way to his
dad's memorial right now.

615
00:36:39,787 --> 00:36:41,007
Dad?

616
00:36:42,757 --> 00:36:44,576
Thank you for stepping
in as my best man.

617
00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:45,958
I love you.

618
00:36:46,907 --> 00:36:48,247
I love you.

619
00:36:52,837 --> 00:36:55,594
Let us honor the lives
of those we've lost,

620
00:36:55,596 --> 00:36:58,635
by holding their memories in our hearts

621
00:36:58,637 --> 00:37:01,787
as we celebrate one
of life's greatest joys.

622
00:37:06,787 --> 00:37:10,295
Tough times come. They always will.

623
00:37:10,297 --> 00:37:15,285
But when they do, Conrad,
I want you by my side.

624
00:37:15,287 --> 00:37:20,157
No matter what, in
sickness and in health.

625
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,629
I promise to always have your back,

626
00:37:22,631 --> 00:37:23,845
no matter what.

627
00:37:23,847 --> 00:37:26,685
I promise to love you,

628
00:37:26,687 --> 00:37:28,715
but to never obey you.

629
00:37:28,717 --> 00:37:32,357
I didn't have my hopes
up for that "obey" part.

630
00:37:33,487 --> 00:37:35,855
Mostly...

631
00:37:35,857 --> 00:37:39,345
I promise you'll never lose me.

632
00:37:39,347 --> 00:37:40,447
This is forever.

633
00:37:43,847 --> 00:37:45,997
For as long as we both shall live.

634
00:38:01,997 --> 00:38:04,555
Conrad Theodore Hawkins

635
00:38:04,557 --> 00:38:06,555
and Nicolette Marie Nevin,

636
00:38:06,557 --> 00:38:08,555
sounds to me like you take each other

637
00:38:08,557 --> 00:38:10,474
as lawfully wedded husband and wife.

638
00:38:10,476 --> 00:38:12,853
We do.

639
00:38:12,855 --> 00:38:15,854
Then by the power vested
in me by the city of Atlanta

640
00:38:15,856 --> 00:38:20,185
and MakeMeAMinisterToday.com,
I hereby declare it official.

641
00:38:20,187 --> 00:38:22,987
You may now enjoy your first
kiss as husband and wife.

642
00:39:06,827 --> 00:39:09,265
Oh, yeah.

643
00:39:11,157 --> 00:39:13,372
- Oh, Randolph?
- No. No, don't ask.

644
00:39:13,374 --> 00:39:15,873
- Don't ask.
- Oh, come on, come on, come on.

645
00:39:15,875 --> 00:39:17,543
I know you've got moves.

646
00:39:17,545 --> 00:39:19,953
You know what? They could
be good for each other.

647
00:39:19,955 --> 00:39:22,533
You know he was there for her
the whole time she was sick?

648
00:39:22,535 --> 00:39:26,093
He'd buy her food, he'd
schedule her nurses' visits.

649
00:39:26,095 --> 00:39:29,734
- I-Is there a chance?
- I mean, could be.

650
00:39:29,736 --> 00:39:31,393
Bell should be so lucky.

651
00:39:31,395 --> 00:39:33,393
Oh, man.

652
00:39:33,395 --> 00:39:36,143
♪ My own soul's warning... ♪

653
00:39:36,145 --> 00:39:38,403
"Meet me under the covered bridge"?

654
00:39:38,405 --> 00:39:42,073
What's up with the cryptic text?

655
00:39:42,075 --> 00:39:44,113
Andrea was supposed to be your guest.

656
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:45,835
But you're alone. Why?

657
00:39:47,075 --> 00:39:50,433
We're not together anymore.

658
00:39:50,435 --> 00:39:52,083
We broke up.

659
00:39:52,085 --> 00:39:53,753
What happened?

660
00:39:53,755 --> 00:39:55,455
What did you do?

661
00:39:56,913 --> 00:39:59,753
You see the way Conrad looks at Nic?

662
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:03,083
Andrea deserves someone

663
00:40:03,085 --> 00:40:04,854
who looks at her like that.

664
00:40:04,856 --> 00:40:07,896
And quite frankly, I'm not that guy.

665
00:40:12,845 --> 00:40:17,333
You know, if I were to be honest, to me,

666
00:40:17,335 --> 00:40:20,333
she was just filling the space
that I wanted you to fill.

667
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:21,784
- But I told you...
- I know.

668
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:23,733
You don't want to lose
what we have in the OR.

669
00:40:23,735 --> 00:40:27,453
I get it. I don't want to
lose that, either, Mina.

670
00:40:27,455 --> 00:40:30,403
Look, you asked me, right?
So I'm telling you the truth.

671
00:40:30,405 --> 00:40:33,125
That's what we do, right?

672
00:40:34,419 --> 00:40:37,169
Don't worry, I'm not expecting anything.

673
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:46,055
This changes nothing.

674
00:41:00,355 --> 00:41:02,025
How about that?

675
00:41:19,752 --> 00:41:22,411
Dr. Pravesh, your
father's respiratory failure

676
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:23,442
is getting worse.

677
00:41:23,444 --> 00:41:24,883
We need to intubate him.

678
00:41:24,885 --> 00:41:26,333
What's the prognosis?

679
00:41:26,335 --> 00:41:27,863
We are doing everything we can,

680
00:41:27,865 --> 00:41:30,163
but he's very sick.

681
00:41:30,165 --> 00:41:33,145
Uh, I need to speak to him
before you intubate, please.

682
00:41:33,147 --> 00:41:34,286
Yes, of course.

683
00:41:39,885 --> 00:41:42,895
Dad, can you hear me?

684
00:41:45,025 --> 00:41:46,863
Dad, hang on.

685
00:41:46,865 --> 00:41:48,573
They're gonna intubate,
but don't give up.

686
00:41:48,575 --> 00:41:50,813
Keep fighting.

687
00:41:50,815 --> 00:41:52,402
People recover from this.

688
00:41:52,404 --> 00:41:54,443
People just like you. You...

689
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:57,875
You can make it, you just...
you just got to fight.

690
00:42:01,325 --> 00:42:02,992
So proud of you, Devon.

691
00:42:06,865 --> 00:42:09,663
Take care of your mom.

692
00:42:09,665 --> 00:42:12,825
I will take care of Mom,
no matter what. I promise.

693
00:42:14,225 --> 00:42:17,895
Dad, listen to me.

694
00:42:18,895 --> 00:42:22,103
I would be nothing without you.

695
00:42:22,105 --> 00:42:23,874
You helped put me
through medical school,

696
00:42:23,876 --> 00:42:27,285
driving nights and weekends,
working overtime.

697
00:42:27,287 --> 00:42:30,986
I believed in myself
because you believed in me.

698
00:42:30,988 --> 00:42:34,103
And I always knew, no matter
what, that you loved me.

699
00:42:34,105 --> 00:42:38,075
You are... everything.

700
00:42:40,605 --> 00:42:42,375
Dad?

701
00:42:44,085 --> 00:42:46,703
Dad?

702
00:42:46,705 --> 00:42:48,633
Can you hear me?

703
00:42:48,635 --> 00:42:51,213
Can you hear me? Dad?

704
00:42:51,215 --> 00:42:54,225
Dad, can you hear me?

705
00:43:03,635 --> 00:43:05,605
I love you, Dad.
