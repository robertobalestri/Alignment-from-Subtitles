I can take care of him.

4
00:00:09,879 --> 00:00:11,117

- I have not had a second...
- Mom kicked it.

8
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:28,637
Yeah. Like a date.

9
00:00:45,393 --> 00:00:46,587
Hmm.

What did you do to my sink?

13
00:01:01,365 --> 00:01:02,864
Upgrading it.

14
00:01:02,888 --> 00:01:04,368
Pop! Pop!

15
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:07,304
This is not an upgrade!

16

No, it wasn't!

19
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:13,136

You want me to fix it or not?

22
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,531
I want you to not trash my apartment.

23

You know what?

28
00:01:24,607 --> 00:01:25,974
I saw the building you manage.

29
00:01:25,998 --> 00:01:28,107
No offense, but don't do me
no favors, all right?

30

Instead of filling that glass,

37
00:02:00,163 --> 00:02:01,599
can you help me clean a few?

38
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,301
Was that really necessary, Lauren?

39
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:09,337
Like, right now?

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,491
No.

41
00:02:13,568 --> 00:02:15,135
Sorry.

42
00:02:16,658 --> 00:02:18,940
I mean, are you even
mourning Mom, or...?

43
00:02:18,964 --> 00:02:20,116
What?

44
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,595
Of course I'm mourning her.

45
00:02:21,619 --> 00:02:24,294
Okay, well, you might be able
to completely shut down,

46
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:26,252
compartmentalize, and run off
to your little job...

47
00:02:26,276 --> 00:02:27,775
Oh, because I have a job,

48
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:29,255
you think I don't care
that our mother is dead?

49
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:30,604
Whatever, Lauren, I'm just saying,

50
00:02:30,628 --> 00:02:32,432
I need time to process this, all right?

51
00:02:32,456 --> 00:02:34,869
This is, like... this is, like, a loss.

52
00:02:34,893 --> 00:02:36,610
I mean, Jesus,
I don't even know how this...

53
00:02:36,634 --> 00:02:38,438
I don't even know how this happened.

54
00:02:38,462 --> 00:02:40,832
Right, yeah, how could a 63-year-old

55
00:02:40,856 --> 00:02:44,096
pill-popping, raging alcoholic
just fall down and die?

56
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,445
Quite easily, as it turns out.

57
00:02:45,469 --> 00:02:47,273
And the way you adjust, Ness,

58
00:02:47,297 --> 00:02:49,275
is by letting this be a wake-up call.

59
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:51,059
Start taking responsibility
for your life.

60
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,801
Oh, my God, you can't
help yourself, can you?

61
00:02:53,825 --> 00:02:55,281
You know, I thought
you weren't supposed to take

62
00:02:55,305 --> 00:02:57,370
people's inventory
in whatever "A" you're in.

63
00:02:57,394 --> 00:02:58,980
Can you just sober up
before we have the meeting

64
00:02:59,004 --> 00:03:00,156
with the lawyer tonight?

65
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,548
And there it is... that is what

66
00:03:01,572 --> 00:03:03,637
this is really about, Lauren, isn't it?

67
00:03:03,661 --> 00:03:05,639
Put on a united front
so they can crown you

68
00:03:05,663 --> 00:03:08,251
the executor of Mom's entire estate.

69
00:03:08,275 --> 00:03:09,948
Right, well, one of us has to be

70
00:03:09,972 --> 00:03:11,592
the responsible one, right?

71
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,865
And I tell you this much,

72
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:16,138
I'm not going to enable you
the way Mom did.

73
00:03:18,023 --> 00:03:21,264
No more allowance
so you can spend it on drugs.

74
00:03:21,288 --> 00:03:22,917
No more free rent

75
00:03:22,941 --> 00:03:24,571
so you can turn your place
into a crack den.

76
00:03:24,595 --> 00:03:26,225
Nope, that all ends today.

77
00:03:26,249 --> 00:03:28,227

98
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,495
So here.

99
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:05,063
The patient satisfaction survey results.

100
00:05:05,087 --> 00:05:06,325
Great.

101
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:07,500
Clearly you haven't read them.

102
00:05:07,524 --> 00:05:10,155
I have not, but these are
gonna be a great distraction.

103
00:05:10,179 --> 00:05:11,287
From what?

104
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,790
From myself.

105
00:05:14,836 --> 00:05:16,422
Patient satisfaction surveys.

106
00:05:16,446 --> 00:05:18,468
Wanna know your PSS scores?

107
00:05:18,492 --> 00:05:20,948
- No.
- 44%.

108
00:05:20,972 --> 00:05:24,038
Okay, you wanna know why
I get bad scores?

109
00:05:24,062 --> 00:05:26,519
I've been compiling a list
over the years.

110
00:05:26,543 --> 00:05:28,608
Last week, a woman complained

111
00:05:28,632 --> 00:05:31,437
because the person next to her
was dying too loudly.

112
00:05:31,461 --> 00:05:33,744
- Hmm.
- Dying too loudly!

113
00:05:33,768 --> 00:05:36,094
- It's a hospital.
- Yeah, it is.

114
00:05:36,118 --> 00:05:37,225
Keep up the great work.

115
00:05:42,472 --> 00:05:44,494
- Floyd, just in time.
- For what?

116
00:05:44,518 --> 00:05:46,670
The, uh, patient
satisfaction scores are in.

117
00:05:46,694 --> 00:05:49,237
Your department received a...
drumroll, please...

118
00:05:49,261 --> 00:05:50,413
51%.

119
00:05:50,437 --> 00:05:52,502
Ugh. Sorry, man.

120
00:05:52,526 --> 00:05:55,050
Oh, don't be. It's great. Nailed it!

121
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:58,464
39%.

122
00:05:58,488 --> 00:06:01,728
Your department officially has
the lowest score.

123
00:06:01,752 --> 00:06:03,730
All of my patients have cancer, Max.

124
00:06:03,754 --> 00:06:05,253
Of course my department has
the lowest score.

125
00:06:05,277 --> 00:06:06,888
Yeah, of course, great work.

126
00:06:10,718 --> 00:06:12,720
Thank you. I'll see you later, okay?

127
00:06:13,851 --> 00:06:16,221
- Hmm. Oh, hey.
- Oh!

128
00:06:16,245 --> 00:06:17,875
Iggy, just the man I wanted to see.

129
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:20,530
Do you mind if I talk to you
about your PSS scores?

130
00:06:20,554 --> 00:06:22,140
Oh, oh, all right.
Uh, what are we looking at?

131
00:06:22,164 --> 00:06:24,664
Some high-60s, mid-70s? What?

132
00:06:24,688 --> 00:06:26,516
Actually, it's, um...

133
00:06:28,257 --> 00:06:30,104
It's 91%.

134
00:06:30,128 --> 00:06:31,802
- It's 91%?
- Mm.

135
00:06:31,826 --> 00:06:33,499
- That-that's huge.
- Mm.

136
00:06:33,523 --> 00:06:34,848
That's a new record. Yes! Up top!

137
00:06:34,872 --> 00:06:37,416
No, no, not up top.
That number is terrible.

138
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,376
Uh, 91% satisfaction is terrible?

139
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,681
Correct.

140
00:06:41,705 --> 00:06:43,596
Satisfaction is not really
our goal, health is.

141
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,425
I think if we were
selling smoothies or Slinkys,

142
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:48,253
then these patient satisfaction surveys

143
00:06:48,277 --> 00:06:50,037
would be a great barometer
of how we were doing that,

144
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:52,431
but our patients come to New Amsterdam

145
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:54,259
on arguably the worst day of their life,

146
00:06:54,283 --> 00:06:56,696
where we tell them things
they really don't wanna hear.

147
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,829
So I think if they are "satisfied,"

148
00:06:58,853 --> 00:07:00,874
then that means
we're doing something wrong,

149
00:07:00,898 --> 00:07:02,963
or we're asking the wrong questions.

150
00:07:02,987 --> 00:07:04,443
- Does it really now?
- Mm-hmm.

151
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:06,097
"Were you greeted with a smile?"

152
00:07:06,121 --> 00:07:07,446
Really?

153
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,579
"Did you enjoy the décor?"
Honestly, who cares?

154
00:07:09,603 --> 00:07:11,276
Since my entire department's
grant funding

155
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,104
is directly tied to these scores...

156
00:07:13,128 --> 00:07:14,627
which are stellar...

157
00:07:14,651 --> 00:07:16,324
- I care.
- Good!

158
00:07:16,348 --> 00:07:17,761
I'm glad you do. I care too.

159
00:07:17,785 --> 00:07:18,719
That's why I'm changing the survey.

160
00:07:18,743 --> 00:07:20,416
What? No, no. What? No!

161
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,069
Just to be more accurate.

162
00:07:22,093 --> 00:07:24,724
More honest questions
means more honest answers.

163
00:07:24,748 --> 00:07:26,160
- Max... Max!
- Iggy.

164
00:07:26,184 --> 00:07:27,640
If we're not improving, we're failing.

165
00:07:27,664 --> 00:07:29,729
You'll thank me later.

166
00:07:29,753 --> 00:07:31,992
Hiya Diallo, 12-year-old female.

167
00:07:32,016 --> 00:07:34,473
Bike accident, head trauma.
LOC on the scene.

168
00:07:34,497 --> 00:07:36,606
Avi Diallo, 17-year-old male.

169
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,477
Elbow contusions,
multiple skin abrasions.

170
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:39,739
Please help my sister!

171
00:07:39,763 --> 00:07:41,175
A car swerved into our bike lane.

172
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,263
I tried to help her...

173
00:07:42,287 --> 00:07:43,264
It's okay. It's okay. We got it.

174
00:07:43,288 --> 00:07:44,440
Both pupils are sluggish.

175
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,161
She needs a head CT stat. Let's move.

176
00:07:51,732 --> 00:07:54,145
Avi. How you feeling?

177
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:55,886
How's my sister?

178
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,235
Did she wake up?

179
00:07:57,259 --> 00:07:59,542
She sustained
a significant amount of trauma

180
00:07:59,566 --> 00:08:00,978
to the right side of her brain.

181
00:08:01,002 --> 00:08:04,111
She has what's called
a subdural hematoma,

182
00:08:04,135 --> 00:08:06,853
which means there's bleeding
in her brain from the fall.

183
00:08:06,877 --> 00:08:09,943
She also has paralysis of the left arm.

184
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:11,815
Look, she needs surgery right away

185
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:14,276
to avoid a brain herniation
that could be fatal.

186
00:08:15,756 --> 00:08:16,994
No, eh, I...

187
00:08:17,018 --> 00:08:18,299
Now, are your parents at home?

188
00:08:18,323 --> 00:08:19,475
Are they at work?

189
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,563
We need to notify them right away.

190
00:08:20,587 --> 00:08:24,349
You can't... they're in, um, Cancun.

191
00:08:24,373 --> 00:08:25,548
Vacationing.

192
00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:28,769
Okay, can we get their number?

193
00:08:30,248 --> 00:08:31,748
No, no.

194
00:08:31,772 --> 00:08:34,054
- Ah, name of the hotel?
- No.

195
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:36,082
They-they check in when they can.

196
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,450
But if they call
when you do the surgery,

197
00:08:38,474 --> 00:08:40,321
I'll update them.

198
00:08:42,739 --> 00:08:45,675
Okay. Uh, thanks, Avi.

199
00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:48,615
I'm gonna go check on Hiya.
and be right back, okay?

200
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:55,336
Dr. Turan, can you call Child
Protective Services for me?

201
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,121
Why? What's going on?

202
00:08:57,145 --> 00:08:59,397
Nothing that kid is telling me is true.

203
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:08,567
Oh, you trying to win a sister over

204
00:09:08,591 --> 00:09:10,351
- with sugar now, huh?
- Hey, trying?

205
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,049
I thought I already had.

206
00:09:12,073 --> 00:09:14,573
Uh, although I am sorry for all
the back-and-forth lately.

207
00:09:14,597 --> 00:09:17,271
Ever since my pops moved in,
things have been out of whack.

208
00:09:17,295 --> 00:09:21,101
But maybe, just maybe,
we can make up for lost time.

209
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,626
Or maybe the time we had was enough.

210
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:24,931
I'm supposed to be leaving soon, anyway.

211
00:09:24,955 --> 00:09:26,237
Yeah, you keep saying that.

212
00:09:26,261 --> 00:09:27,412
Excuse me.

213
00:09:27,436 --> 00:09:30,850
Uh, you looking for the OB department?

214
00:09:30,874 --> 00:09:32,765
Yes, I need to give up my baby.

215
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:34,985
Oh, are you, uh, in labor?

216
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:36,445
Mm-mm.

217
00:09:36,768 --> 00:09:38,684
Do you need to talk
to a hospital social worker

218
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:39,946
about the adoption process?

219
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,905
No.

220
00:09:41,929 --> 00:09:44,951
I need my baby to be delivered today.

221
00:09:44,975 --> 00:09:47,084
Otherwise, I'm gonna kill it.

222
00:09:56,508 --> 00:09:58,075
And for you.

223
00:10:00,904 --> 00:10:02,689
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

224
00:10:04,212 --> 00:10:06,233
- Are these the new surveys?
- Sure are. There you go.

225
00:10:06,257 --> 00:10:08,496
And remember,
complete candor is welcome.

226
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,803
And for you.

227
00:10:10,827 --> 00:10:14,241
Hey, hey. Are you seeing this?

228
00:10:14,265 --> 00:10:15,808
Are you doing the surveys
over the phone?

229
00:10:15,832 --> 00:10:17,157
Max told me to call.

230
00:10:17,181 --> 00:10:18,245
Call who?

231
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:20,465
Every patient we have.

232
00:10:20,489 --> 00:10:22,313
And there you go.

233
00:10:23,187 --> 00:10:25,015
Hi, Maureen. I'm ready for you.

234
00:10:28,062 --> 00:10:29,692
Sorry, Iggy,
don't want to bias the results.

235
00:10:29,716 --> 00:10:30,997
- Uh...
- Here we go.

236
00:10:31,021 --> 00:10:32,564
Gladys, you're better than that.

237
00:10:32,588 --> 00:10:34,740
Fill that out. One through five.

238
00:10:34,764 --> 00:10:36,655
Just fill whatever feels right.

239
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:38,788
Go ahead and mark that down.

240
00:10:38,812 --> 00:10:40,137
Uh-huh.

241
00:10:40,161 --> 00:10:42,052
Almost there, Dr. Frome.

242
00:10:42,076 --> 00:10:44,750
Just need to finish this survey.

243
00:10:44,774 --> 00:10:47,422
Turns out I got a lot to say.

244
00:10:51,781 --> 00:10:53,106
Bob, Louise, thank you for coming.

245
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,282
Skip the preamble.
Just tell me how long.

246
00:10:55,306 --> 00:10:56,936
Whatever time I have left, I wanna spend

247
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,808
as little time as possible
in this office.

248
00:10:58,832 --> 00:11:00,592
She'd tell you if you stop talking.

249
00:11:00,616 --> 00:11:03,682
Okay, so-so I actually,
I have some good news.

250
00:11:03,706 --> 00:11:05,795
I just got your numbers.

251
00:11:07,492 --> 00:11:09,340
And they're what?

252
00:11:09,364 --> 00:11:11,124
They are phenomenal.

253
00:11:11,148 --> 00:11:13,083
Your cancer has shrunk dramatically.

254
00:11:13,107 --> 00:11:15,825
Uh, now I get to tell you something

255
00:11:15,849 --> 00:11:17,981
that I don't get to say often enough.

256
00:11:18,369 --> 00:11:21,331
You're looking at a full remission.

257
00:11:25,772 --> 00:11:28,533
I told you, Louise. I told you!

258
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:31,014
A miracle occurs,
and the first thing you do

259
00:11:31,038 --> 00:11:32,015
is yell at your wife.

260
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:33,712
Real nice, Bob. Real nice.

261
00:11:33,736 --> 00:11:35,192
Sour grapes?

262
00:11:35,216 --> 00:11:36,889
- Mm...
- I'm relieved, okay?

263
00:11:36,913 --> 00:11:39,109
What the hell's wrong with you?

264
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:42,808
Uh, a cancer diagnosis
is stressful on everyone.

265
00:11:42,832 --> 00:11:44,592
Even good news can be hard to accept

266
00:11:44,616 --> 00:11:45,985
after months of chemotherapy.

267
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:47,247
But that's where you're wrong.

268
00:11:47,271 --> 00:11:49,119
I haven't had months of chemo

269
00:11:49,143 --> 00:11:50,729
because I've been throwing

270
00:11:50,753 --> 00:11:52,339
your stupid pills in the garbage.

271
00:11:52,363 --> 00:11:53,732
Straight into the trash.

272
00:11:53,756 --> 00:11:55,516
Against his wife's wishes.

273
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:58,302
Okay, hold on, you have been
throwing away your chemo pills?

274
00:11:58,326 --> 00:12:00,043
They made me feel sick,
so I stopped taking 'em.

275
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:02,654
And now? I'm not sick.

276
00:12:02,678 --> 00:12:04,830
You doctors, acting so fancy.

277
00:12:04,854 --> 00:12:06,136
You have no clue.

278
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,921
Just a bunch of puppets for Big Pharma.

279
00:12:08,945 --> 00:12:10,296
Mr. Levin, Mr. Levin...

280
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,881
Yeah, save it for the next sucker.

281
00:12:11,905 --> 00:12:13,080
Come on, Louise.

282
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:16,407
Mm-mm. Rise up!

283
00:12:16,431 --> 00:12:18,496
- Take off the blinders!
- Apologies. Again.

284
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,218
- Get out of the chair!
- He gets crazy.

285
00:12:22,567 --> 00:12:23,525
Bob!

286
00:12:23,561 --> 00:12:25,409
_

287
00:12:25,433 --> 00:12:28,456
_

288
00:12:28,551 --> 00:12:30,551
_

289
00:12:31,838 --> 00:12:35,774
Olivette, I know you
don't want to harm your baby.

290
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:38,951
Um, you wouldn't be here if you did.

291
00:12:38,975 --> 00:12:41,021
So you wanna tell us what's going on?

292
00:12:44,241 --> 00:12:47,041
Olivette, when was
your last prenatal visit?

293
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:48,942
Uh...

294
00:12:50,857 --> 00:12:52,249
I haven't gone to any.

295
00:12:54,334 --> 00:12:56,423
You're afraid you'd be judged?

296
00:13:02,589 --> 00:13:04,286
Are you still using?

297
00:13:06,046 --> 00:13:08,415
I stopped once I found out
I was pregnant.

298
00:13:08,439 --> 00:13:10,964
Okay, so you intended to keep the baby.

299
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:13,073
Yes.

300
00:13:15,873 --> 00:13:18,267
The baby was gonna be my new chapter.

301
00:13:20,582 --> 00:13:22,160
I'd be clean.

302
00:13:23,106 --> 00:13:25,455
Like the best mom, you know?

303
00:13:26,341 --> 00:13:27,647
But...

304
00:13:28,895 --> 00:13:30,611
Then you went back out.

305
00:13:30,635 --> 00:13:32,178
About a week ago.

306
00:13:32,202 --> 00:13:34,214
First time in months.

307
00:13:35,317 --> 00:13:38,625
Okay, so what changed?

308
00:13:42,035 --> 00:13:44,646
Didn't need anything to change.

309
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:47,890
It's what I do.

310
00:13:47,914 --> 00:13:50,003
Knew it was gonna happen eventually.

311
00:13:50,355 --> 00:13:52,657
No family, friends?

312
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:54,701
Any support?

313
00:13:55,957 --> 00:13:57,611
None out here.

314
00:14:05,061 --> 00:14:07,580
Olivette, you slipped.

315
00:14:08,151 --> 00:14:09,346
It happens. That's all.

316
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,130
Nah, that ain't the end of it.

317
00:14:11,154 --> 00:14:13,350
I'm gonna keep using, I know it.

318
00:14:13,374 --> 00:14:15,787
And when was the last time
that you felt the baby kick?

319
00:14:15,811 --> 00:14:17,049
Any movement?

320
00:14:17,073 --> 00:14:18,616
I don't know, a few days ago.

321
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,260
Maybe.

322
00:14:21,512 --> 00:14:24,230
I heard 26 weeks is safe
for a baby to be born.

323
00:14:24,254 --> 00:14:26,039
Is that true or not?

324
00:14:28,215 --> 00:14:30,410
Technically, yes, uh,

325
00:14:30,434 --> 00:14:33,109
the baby can survive at six months.

326
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:36,192
- But you're not in labor, and...
- I don't care.

327
00:14:37,068 --> 00:14:39,530
It's not safe with me.

328
00:14:42,533 --> 00:14:43,902
I need it out.

329
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:51,325
Avi.

330
00:14:57,984 --> 00:14:59,178
Hiya's stable.

331
00:14:59,202 --> 00:15:01,093
They're gonna be taking her
for surgery soon.

332
00:15:01,117 --> 00:15:03,530
She is? Thank you.

333
00:15:03,554 --> 00:15:05,837
While they're prepping her,
I need you to come with me.

334
00:15:05,861 --> 00:15:08,037
There's someone who I want you
to talk to, okay?

335
00:15:17,873 --> 00:15:19,005
You called them.

336
00:15:21,056 --> 00:15:22,275
CPS.

337
00:15:24,184 --> 00:15:26,423
Okay, as a doctor,
I am mandated by the state

338
00:15:26,447 --> 00:15:29,121
to report any suspicious behavior.

339
00:15:29,145 --> 00:15:31,104
What suspicious behavior?

340
00:15:31,303 --> 00:15:33,392
Are your parents really in Cancun?

341
00:15:35,021 --> 00:15:36,389
Is Hiya even your sister?

342
00:15:36,413 --> 00:15:37,719
Yes.

343
00:15:38,026 --> 00:15:39,419
Okay.

344
00:15:39,444 --> 00:15:40,923
That's a start.

345
00:15:42,028 --> 00:15:44,302
Look, I wanna help you, okay?

346
00:15:44,873 --> 00:15:46,614
But you need to come with me.

347
00:15:46,728 --> 00:15:48,264
Sure.

348
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,166
All right.

349
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:51,975
Just let me get my bag?

350
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:58,174
Don't...

351
00:15:59,915 --> 00:16:02,154
Avi. Avi, Avi, don't do this.

352
00:16:02,178 --> 00:16:04,243
You said you'd help us! You lied!

353
00:16:04,267 --> 00:16:06,332
Avi. Avi, come on.

354
00:16:06,356 --> 00:16:08,378
- Open the door.
- I can't.

355
00:16:08,402 --> 00:16:11,511
Look, this isn't helping... Hiya or you!

356
00:16:11,535 --> 00:16:13,687
We can't be in the system.
They'll separate us!

357
00:16:13,711 --> 00:16:15,472
Master key.
You want me to call security?

358
00:16:15,496 --> 00:16:16,516
No, no.

359
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,127
Look, Avi.

360
00:16:19,369 --> 00:16:21,217
Avi, we're coming in.

361
00:16:21,241 --> 00:16:22,914
Damn it, Avi!

362
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,574
- What's-what's happening?
- Avi. Avi, she's crashing.

363
00:16:30,598 --> 00:16:32,054
We have to get her up
to the OR right now.

364
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:33,838
No. Turn off the alarm!

365
00:16:33,862 --> 00:16:35,231
I can't do it from out here!

366
00:16:35,255 --> 00:16:36,928
I know you're doing this!
I know it's a trick!

367
00:16:36,952 --> 00:16:38,364
No! This is real!

368
00:16:38,388 --> 00:16:40,497
Look, if you don't
let us in there right now,

369
00:16:40,521 --> 00:16:42,386
then your sister is going to die!

370
00:16:48,964 --> 00:16:50,701
Get her up to the OR stat!

371
00:16:55,884 --> 00:16:57,427
Hot off the presses and straight

372
00:16:57,451 --> 00:16:58,906
into a hermetically sealed envelope.

373
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:02,040
Are you ready for your new PSS scores?

374
00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:04,521
It's not the Oscars, Max.
Just open the damn thing.

375
00:17:04,545 --> 00:17:07,026
And the Oscar goes to...

376
00:17:08,331 --> 00:17:09,352
36%.

377
00:17:09,376 --> 00:17:11,223
Th... oh, my God.

378
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:12,877
No. This can't be happening.

379
00:17:12,901 --> 00:17:16,315
Now you have honest feedback
to make real improvement.

380
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:18,752
Max, my funding will be cut.

381
00:17:18,776 --> 00:17:20,493
Okay, listen to this.

382
00:17:20,517 --> 00:17:21,929
"My new meds made me feel sick,

383
00:17:21,953 --> 00:17:24,149
and I couldn't get a follow-up
for a month."

384
00:17:24,173 --> 00:17:26,064
"When I'm in crisis,
I don't want to wait a week

385
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:27,761
for my next appointment."

386
00:17:27,785 --> 00:17:30,025
"I had to wait three months
to get my first appointment."

387
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,417
Now, if you're asking me,

388
00:17:31,441 --> 00:17:33,724
seems like the unifying factor
here is wait time.

389
00:17:33,748 --> 00:17:36,379
Great... so are you gonna spring,
for ten new therapists?

390
00:17:36,403 --> 00:17:37,510
I don't know if it's a staffing issue.

391
00:17:37,534 --> 00:17:38,772
Seems more like a scheduling issue.

392
00:17:38,796 --> 00:17:41,427
Okay, sure, but you know that scheduling

393
00:17:41,451 --> 00:17:43,734
will never be perfect because
it's not like a patient

394
00:17:43,758 --> 00:17:45,562
can predict a mental health crisis.

395
00:17:45,586 --> 00:17:46,954
You know that, right?

396
00:17:46,978 --> 00:17:48,782
I do, and I couldn't agree more.

397
00:17:48,806 --> 00:17:50,784
- Good. Really?
- Yeah.

398
00:17:50,808 --> 00:17:51,916
You're saying that mental health

399
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,570
is inherently unschedule-able,

400
00:17:53,594 --> 00:17:55,659
so why not toss the whole
schedule out the window?

401
00:17:55,683 --> 00:17:57,095
Right, no more appointments,
first come, first serve.

402
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:58,662
I think that's really smart, buddy.

403
00:17:58,686 --> 00:18:01,056
Uh, hi, can I have the room
for a second, please?

404
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,974
Max.

405
00:18:06,998 --> 00:18:08,759
No appointments will be
wildly disruptive

406
00:18:08,783 --> 00:18:10,108
- to my department, okay?
- Yeah.

407
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:11,849
My patients rely heavily on structure.

408
00:18:11,873 --> 00:18:12,980
Uh-huh.

409
00:18:13,004 --> 00:18:14,199
The predictability and reliability

410
00:18:14,223 --> 00:18:15,635
of scheduled appointments
is everything...

411
00:18:15,659 --> 00:18:17,811
routine is the cornerstone
of their mental health.

412
00:18:17,835 --> 00:18:19,770
Iggy, I hear you,
but this isn't me, okay?

413
00:18:19,794 --> 00:18:21,076
This is the survey.

414
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,947
This is what your patients want.

415
00:18:22,971 --> 00:18:24,154
You know what?

416
00:18:24,178 --> 00:18:25,378
I actually can't even discuss
this with you right now.

417
00:18:25,402 --> 00:18:26,820
Why? Why not?

418
00:18:26,844 --> 00:18:28,300
Because you didn't make an appointment.

419
00:18:28,324 --> 00:18:29,432
See what I did there?

420
00:18:29,456 --> 00:18:30,433
Wouldn't it be nice if you could just

421
00:18:30,457 --> 00:18:31,477
show up with your problems

422
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:32,783
and get help when you need it?

423
00:18:32,807 --> 00:18:34,959
That's the beauty of open access,

424
00:18:34,983 --> 00:18:36,874
and some of these patients
need help today,

425
00:18:36,898 --> 00:18:39,616
Iggy, not in three weeks
on a Tuesday at 4:00 p.m.

426
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,052
So what do you say we give it a shot?

427
00:18:41,076 --> 00:18:42,314
- What's the worst that could...
- No, don't... don't.

428
00:18:42,338 --> 00:18:43,620
Don't say it.

429
00:18:43,644 --> 00:18:46,013
Okay. That's fair. Yeah.

430
00:18:51,347 --> 00:18:52,803
If I may be candid,

431
00:18:52,827 --> 00:18:54,196
there are parts of Bob

432
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,807
that have definitely
gotten smaller with age.

433
00:18:56,831 --> 00:18:59,984
But I didn't know cancer
worked that way.

434
00:19:00,008 --> 00:19:02,943
Spontaneous remission is extremely rare,

435
00:19:02,967 --> 00:19:04,554
but yeah, his cancer's
definitely shrunk.

436
00:19:04,578 --> 00:19:07,861
I just gotta figure out how
because either it's a fluke,

437
00:19:07,885 --> 00:19:10,603
or Bob has inadvertently
found a cure for his cancer.

438
00:19:10,627 --> 00:19:12,127
Oh, please don't tell him that.

439
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,998
That will definitely go to his head.

440
00:19:14,022 --> 00:19:16,870
Nothing is easy with that man. Ever.

441
00:19:16,894 --> 00:19:20,309
But I love him,
even in spite of his behavior.

442
00:19:21,377 --> 00:19:23,225
Finding out you have cancer
is never easy.

443
00:19:23,249 --> 00:19:25,618
Oh, please, I know
several people with cancer

444
00:19:25,642 --> 00:19:27,011
who aren't going through the same

445
00:19:27,035 --> 00:19:30,928
mortality-induced mania
that Bob's going through.

446
00:19:30,952 --> 00:19:32,408
Can you be more specific?

447
00:19:32,432 --> 00:19:36,020
Trading in our Volvo
for a cherry red Miata, fine.

448
00:19:36,044 --> 00:19:38,196
I expect him to do that around this age.

449
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,720
And while the spray tans are unsettling,

450
00:19:40,744 --> 00:19:42,287
I can literally look the other way.

451
00:19:42,311 --> 00:19:44,681
But spending hundreds of dollars a month

452
00:19:44,705 --> 00:19:47,205
on vitamins and elixirs

453
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:49,990
instead of taking the meds
prescribed to him by a doctor

454
00:19:50,014 --> 00:19:52,254
is ridiculous, even for him.

455
00:19:52,278 --> 00:19:55,170
Hang-hang on, what kind
of vitamins and elixirs?

456
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,997
Oh, they all have crazy names.

457
00:19:57,021 --> 00:19:59,174
Are you ready for this, Ben?

458
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,437
"Horny goat weed."

459
00:20:01,461 --> 00:20:03,436
Tell me that's not a scam.

460
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,181
Can you bring me everything
that Bob has been taking?

461
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,704
Everything?

462
00:20:07,728 --> 00:20:10,735
Yes. Everything.

463
00:20:18,304 --> 00:20:19,910
I waited too long.

464
00:20:20,836 --> 00:20:22,359
Opening the door.

465
00:20:23,961 --> 00:20:25,722
Well, she's in good hands now.

466
00:20:28,531 --> 00:20:30,596
It was working.

467
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:34,884
We were doing really good, you know?

468
00:20:35,386 --> 00:20:37,126
Until today.

469
00:20:40,082 --> 00:20:42,432
Are you gonna tell me what's going on?

470
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,649
Both our parents died of COVID.

471
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,641
Two years ago.

472
00:20:54,383 --> 00:20:55,863
I'm really sorry.

473
00:20:56,994 --> 00:20:58,909
We couldn't visit.

474
00:21:00,346 --> 00:21:02,244
We couldn't say goodbye.

475
00:21:02,957 --> 00:21:07,458
They just went to the hospital
and never came home.

476
00:21:10,704 --> 00:21:12,619
What about other family?

477
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:14,154
Grandparents?

478
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:18,340
Hiya and I decided to stay together.

479
00:21:18,364 --> 00:21:20,453
Figured if we go to school,

480
00:21:20,763 --> 00:21:24,266
stay under the radar,
no one would split us up.

481
00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:28,350
I turn 18 in a few months.

482
00:21:28,374 --> 00:21:30,811
Old enough to be her guardian.

483
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:33,001
What about you?

484
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:35,494
What about me?

485
00:21:36,773 --> 00:21:39,752
Who's taking care of you, Avi?

486
00:21:45,826 --> 00:21:47,934
So since this is
your first prenatal exam,

487
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,675
we're just gonna check
the health of the baby

488
00:21:49,699 --> 00:21:51,832
and make sure we can induce labor.

489
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,008
Is that the heart?

490
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,816
That is the heart.

491
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,929
- Nice and strong.
- Mm.

492
00:22:04,127 --> 00:22:05,259
Can I hear it?

493
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:08,332
Sure.

494
00:22:16,552 --> 00:22:18,162
Would you like to know the sex?

495
00:22:20,426 --> 00:22:22,689
Yes. And no.

496
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:24,841
So hey, how about this?

497
00:22:24,865 --> 00:22:26,432
Write it down for you.

498
00:22:29,696 --> 00:22:32,370
Whenever you're ready. Or not.

499
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:37,332
Is there any intrauterine
growth restriction?

500
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:40,227
- None that I can tell, why?
- What's going on?

501
00:22:40,251 --> 00:22:42,511
The baby seems small.

502
00:22:44,537 --> 00:22:46,602
How far along are you again?

503
00:22:46,626 --> 00:22:48,343
26 weeks.

504
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:51,258
- Since your last cycle?
- I guess.

505
00:22:51,282 --> 00:22:53,459
Take a femur length measurement.

506
00:22:56,462 --> 00:22:59,484
That's 23 weeks. It's off by 3.

507
00:22:59,508 --> 00:23:01,051
So...

508
00:23:01,075 --> 00:23:02,792
so what does that mean?

509
00:23:02,816 --> 00:23:04,359
That would mean that your-your baby's

510
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,056
too premature for us to induce labor.

511
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,494
If we were to do it now,
it probably wouldn't even survive.

512
00:23:09,518 --> 00:23:11,409
You're gonna have to carry
another three to four weeks.

513
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:12,802
No.

514
00:23:12,826 --> 00:23:16,353
No, that's impossible.
I can't. I know what I am.

515
00:23:17,091 --> 00:23:18,938
- I'm an addict.
- Yeah, I know.

516
00:23:18,962 --> 00:23:20,505
Well, we can get you into rehab.

517
00:23:20,529 --> 00:23:23,421
I've done more using in rehab
than I do on the streets.

518
00:23:23,445 --> 00:23:25,815
No, you're not listening to me.
I can't do this!

519
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:27,425
- No, I can't do this!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

520
00:23:27,449 --> 00:23:29,906
- No, I can't do this!
- Call security!

521
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:31,777
- Seriously?
- Security? What for?

522
00:23:31,801 --> 00:23:32,996
Floyd, don't do this.

523
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,171
Well, she's not giving us a choice.

524
00:23:34,195 --> 00:23:35,433
Look, I'm gonna put you on a psych hold.

525
00:23:35,457 --> 00:23:36,608
You're not gonna be able
to leave the hospital.

526
00:23:36,632 --> 00:23:37,957
No! Why?

527
00:23:37,981 --> 00:23:40,743
Reckless endangerment
of an unborn child.

528
00:23:40,767 --> 00:23:42,986
Call security!

529
00:23:47,687 --> 00:23:49,795
Hey, I have a scheduled appointment.

530
00:23:49,819 --> 00:23:51,449
- But I was here first.
- I know, I know.

531
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:53,016
Uh, everybody, that's...
hey, that's enough!

532
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,409
That is enough!

533
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,149
Please form a line to the right
of the hallway.

534
00:23:56,173 --> 00:23:58,151
Yeah, but what am I supposed
to do with this?

535
00:23:58,175 --> 00:24:00,066
Are you the person
to give the survey to?

536
00:24:03,224 --> 00:24:04,897
Just asking. Thank you very much.

537
00:24:04,921 --> 00:24:06,029
Have a good day.

538
00:24:06,053 --> 00:24:07,813
Hey, hi, hi.

539
00:24:07,837 --> 00:24:09,119
Do you have a scheduling nurse

540
00:24:09,143 --> 00:24:10,555
that I can borrow just for a little bit?

541
00:24:10,579 --> 00:24:11,904
I'm drowning up there.

542
00:24:11,928 --> 00:24:13,210
How'd you get so buried?

543
00:24:13,234 --> 00:24:15,168
Uh, Max. How else, you know?

544
00:24:15,192 --> 00:24:16,866
He forced me to institute open access,

545
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:19,434
and now my department
is just flipped upside-down,

546
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,261
all because of a stupid survey,
you know?

547
00:24:21,285 --> 00:24:23,089
Love the guy, but I just wanna...

548
00:24:23,113 --> 00:24:24,308
wanna strangle him sometimes.

549
00:24:24,332 --> 00:24:26,092
He's just over-asking and over-promising

550
00:24:26,116 --> 00:24:28,213
and over-everything.

551
00:24:29,076 --> 00:24:31,010
Tell me about it.

552
00:24:31,034 --> 00:24:33,167
Oh, yeah? Why, what'd he do to you?

553
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:37,103
You can ask Nurse Colleen.
She's available.

554
00:24:37,127 --> 00:24:39,715
Yes, yes, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

555
00:24:39,739 --> 00:24:41,456
Somebody having
a mid-life crisis down here?

556
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,632
All you're missing is the toupee.

557
00:24:43,656 --> 00:24:45,155
Thank you. Thanks again.

558
00:24:48,817 --> 00:24:51,543
_

559
00:25:06,417 --> 00:25:08,308
So you're actually
committing a pregnant woman

560
00:25:08,332 --> 00:25:09,396
like she's a criminal.

561
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,137
I never said she's a criminal.

562
00:25:11,161 --> 00:25:12,530
Though, by her own admission,

563
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:14,924
she's a threat to herself
and her unborn child.

564
00:25:14,948 --> 00:25:17,274
Is this Gilead? Give me a break.

565
00:25:17,298 --> 00:25:19,232
Look, I'm giving the patient
what she wants,

566
00:25:19,256 --> 00:25:22,888
which is... stapler...
a chance for her child.

567
00:25:22,912 --> 00:25:24,107
Then tell me this:

568
00:25:24,131 --> 00:25:26,239
could a woman in New York, if need be,

569
00:25:26,263 --> 00:25:28,807
terminate her pregnancy at 23 weeks?

570
00:25:28,831 --> 00:25:30,069
Yes.

571
00:25:30,093 --> 00:25:31,331
And would she be detained for it?

572
00:25:31,355 --> 00:25:33,377
Oh, come on, this isn't a life sentence.

573
00:25:33,401 --> 00:25:35,814
Olivette will only be held
until she reaches 26 weeks.

574
00:25:35,838 --> 00:25:38,904
And what about the baby?
Become a ward of the state?

575
00:25:38,928 --> 00:25:40,123
Because good luck finding someone

576
00:25:40,147 --> 00:25:41,864
to adopt a 26-week-old preemie.

577
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,648
Okay, I am not the bad guy here.

578
00:25:43,672 --> 00:25:45,998
But you are stacking the odds
against this baby from day one.

579
00:25:46,022 --> 00:25:48,218
Okay, don't you think I know
all the societal challenges

580
00:25:48,242 --> 00:25:49,567
for babies like hers?

581
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:51,264
Detaining Olivette is not ideal,

582
00:25:51,288 --> 00:25:52,831
- but I'm listening to the...
- Are you?

583
00:25:52,855 --> 00:25:53,919
- Are you fully listening?
- Yes.

584
00:25:53,943 --> 00:25:55,530
I'm trying to save a child.

585
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,880
But you're gonna fail if you
can't save the mother first.

586
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:17,976
Avi.

587
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:25,516
So we're gonna keep Hiya here
for a few more days,

588
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:28,456
but we are expecting her
to make a full recovery.

589
00:26:32,178 --> 00:26:33,309
Thank you.

590
00:26:35,463 --> 00:26:36,829
Avi...

591
00:26:37,508 --> 00:26:40,374
look, this isn't gonna be easy
for you to hear,

592
00:26:40,773 --> 00:26:42,577
but once she's discharged,

593
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,709
Hiya is gonna become
a ward of the state.

594
00:26:44,733 --> 00:26:46,581
No! She can't.

595
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,757
I-I can do better.
I can take care of her.

596
00:26:48,781 --> 00:26:51,237
I know you can. I know.

597
00:26:51,261 --> 00:26:53,612
That's not what this is about, okay?

598
00:26:55,483 --> 00:26:57,933
Look, Hiya's injuries were physical.

599
00:26:58,965 --> 00:27:00,686
We could fix those.

600
00:27:01,097 --> 00:27:03,317
But you have injuries too.

601
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:08,859
You do, and people might not
be able to see them.

602
00:27:10,324 --> 00:27:12,694
But that doesn't mean they're not there.

603
00:27:12,718 --> 00:27:14,328
What are you saying?

604
00:27:15,764 --> 00:27:18,700
New Amsterdam Hospital
has a mental health department

605
00:27:18,724 --> 00:27:21,137
which specializes
in child traumatic grief...

606
00:27:21,161 --> 00:27:23,313
No. No. Mm-mm. No.

607
00:27:23,337 --> 00:27:25,576
Wait, just listen to me.
Just listen to me.

608
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,969
Okay?

609
00:27:26,993 --> 00:27:29,711
They can give you the support
that you need.

610
00:27:29,735 --> 00:27:33,739
And eventually, you can move forward.

611
00:27:33,969 --> 00:27:36,889
And in a couple of months,
when you turn 18,

612
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,677
I really think you're gonna be better.

613
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:40,976
I do.

614
00:27:41,485 --> 00:27:44,116
And ready... ready to take in Hiya.

615
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,023
And be her guardian.

616
00:27:47,448 --> 00:27:48,773
In the truest sense of the word.

617
00:27:48,797 --> 00:27:49,948
Come here.

618
00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:02,004
Hey, Max.

619
00:28:02,028 --> 00:28:06,182
I have the, uh, new test score
right here.

620
00:28:06,206 --> 00:28:07,662
5%.

621
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:10,186
- 5% increase?
- No, no. No. Take a look.

622
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:13,276
That's a 5% total score.

623
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,712
- Ah.
- Yeah.

624
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:17,367
That is the single lowest score
in the history

625
00:28:17,391 --> 00:28:20,326
of any department
at this hospital... ever.

626
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:23,373
The last record-holder was Rikers.

627
00:28:23,397 --> 00:28:26,985
I am losing out to jail.

628
00:28:27,009 --> 00:28:28,857
But isn't open access better
for the patients?

629
00:28:28,881 --> 00:28:30,336
Better for the patients?

630
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,991
You saw the "last helicopter
out of Saigon" scenario

631
00:28:33,015 --> 00:28:34,340
in my waiting room, right?

632
00:28:34,364 --> 00:28:36,168
You were there?

633
00:28:36,192 --> 00:28:39,389
My staff spent the entire day just, uh,

634
00:28:39,413 --> 00:28:42,261
careening from one
upset patient to the next.

635
00:28:42,285 --> 00:28:44,350
That's all they had time to do all day.

636
00:28:44,374 --> 00:28:46,178
Well, isn't it better
to inconvenience a few

637
00:28:46,202 --> 00:28:48,180
- for the greater...
- No. No! It's not, Max.

638
00:28:48,204 --> 00:28:49,664
It's not better for anybody.

639
00:28:50,946 --> 00:28:53,011
I have followed you around for years,

640
00:28:53,035 --> 00:28:54,404
a cheerleader just watching you

641
00:28:54,428 --> 00:28:56,188
casually knock everything down,
but not anymore.

642
00:28:56,212 --> 00:28:58,103
My department was working.

643
00:28:58,127 --> 00:28:59,583
And it was working well!

644
00:28:59,607 --> 00:29:01,759
And now your insistence
on treating everybody

645
00:29:01,783 --> 00:29:04,177
all at the same time
is working for nobody.

646
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:06,024
My staff included.

647
00:29:06,048 --> 00:29:07,722
So no, I am not gonna go along

648
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,594
with your little
Quixotic experiment anymore.

649
00:29:10,618 --> 00:29:12,857
All right, why can't you just
leave well enough alone?

650
00:29:12,881 --> 00:29:15,033
We have a good thing going, Max.

651
00:29:15,057 --> 00:29:17,146
You ruined it.

652
00:29:17,512 --> 00:29:18,774
Why?

653
00:29:22,123 --> 00:29:23,429
You're right.

654
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,868
Do what you have to do.

655
00:29:31,073 --> 00:29:32,747
Thank you.

656
00:29:42,388 --> 00:29:45,063
All right, are you sure
that this is everything

657
00:29:45,087 --> 00:29:46,525
that you've been taking for your...

658
00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:49,154
- Breakdown?
- Holistic healing journey?

659
00:29:49,178 --> 00:29:50,808
Yes.

660
00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:52,331
What is this, some kind of shakedown?

661
00:29:52,355 --> 00:29:54,812
Were you taking a drug
known as antoderide?

662
00:29:58,753 --> 00:30:00,687
What's it for?

663
00:30:00,711 --> 00:30:02,298
- For hair loss.
- Why would I take that?

664
00:30:02,322 --> 00:30:04,343
Bob, we can all see the giant bald spot

665
00:30:04,367 --> 00:30:05,562
on the back of your head.

666
00:30:05,586 --> 00:30:07,456
Ben has a perfect view.

667
00:30:08,241 --> 00:30:10,828
Then fine, I'm taking it. So what?

668
00:30:10,852 --> 00:30:13,613
I wanted to feel young
for however long I had left.

669
00:30:13,637 --> 00:30:14,832
Sue me.

670
00:30:14,856 --> 00:30:18,618
Dr. Wilder, is that drug the
reason that his tumor shrank?

671
00:30:18,642 --> 00:30:20,185
Not a lot of people know this,

672
00:30:20,209 --> 00:30:23,014
but Viagra was first invented
to treat hypertension.

673
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:24,886
For the record, I'm not on Viagra.

674
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:25,757
Yet.

675
00:30:25,781 --> 00:30:27,323
- Louise.
- What?

676
00:30:27,347 --> 00:30:30,239
But when the company realized
that they had a gold mine

677
00:30:30,263 --> 00:30:31,806
for treating erectile dysfunction,

678
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,894
they rebranded it.

679
00:30:32,918 --> 00:30:34,983
My point here is that sometimes,

680
00:30:35,007 --> 00:30:36,811
discoveries are made on accident,

681
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,378
and you... you, Bob, you're living proof

682
00:30:39,402 --> 00:30:42,860
that antoderide
has this amazing side effect

683
00:30:42,884 --> 00:30:44,862
of treating Gonsalves' tumors.

684
00:30:44,886 --> 00:30:47,517
So my hair medication
will get rebranded?

685
00:30:47,541 --> 00:30:48,648
Will that make it more expensive?

686
00:30:48,672 --> 00:30:49,867
- Bob!
- What?

687
00:30:49,891 --> 00:30:51,564
It's not all about you.

688
00:30:51,588 --> 00:30:52,957
No. No, no, no, no, no.

689
00:30:52,981 --> 00:30:55,046
Your cancer is so rare,

690
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,352
it just doesn't make a lot
of financial sense,

691
00:30:56,376 --> 00:30:59,659
but there is an organization
that logs drugs

692
00:30:59,683 --> 00:31:03,228
with unexpected and potentially
lifesaving side effects.

693
00:31:03,252 --> 00:31:05,361
So with your permission,

694
00:31:05,385 --> 00:31:07,929
I would like to share
your numbers with them.

695
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:15,762
Well, if it'll help humanity
and whatnot, sure.

696
00:31:15,786 --> 00:31:17,353
Glad to help.

697
00:31:30,627 --> 00:31:32,997
- Hey.
- Hey.

698
00:31:33,021 --> 00:31:33,979
Uh...

699
00:31:35,676 --> 00:31:37,784
Just wanted to officially apologize

700
00:31:37,808 --> 00:31:40,613
for forcing open access on you.

701
00:31:40,637 --> 00:31:43,225
It was, uh, clearly a bust,

702
00:31:43,249 --> 00:31:45,923
and I-I don't blame you
for switching back.

703
00:31:45,947 --> 00:31:47,664
Well, I didn't switch back.

704
00:31:47,688 --> 00:31:48,926
- No?
- No. Kept it.

705
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:51,233
- You kept it?
- Yeah, we kept it.

706
00:31:51,257 --> 00:31:53,888
Exhibit A, you just waltzed right in

707
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:54,976
and started talking, didn't you?

708
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,934
Uh, yeah, I did, but you...

709
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:58,936
I thought it was a disaster.

710
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,198
Yeah, it was more like a train wreck,

711
00:32:00,222 --> 00:32:02,592
but, uh, you know,
once we sorted through

712
00:32:02,616 --> 00:32:05,943
the rather sizable backlog
of patients in our system,

713
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:08,119
um, open access actually integrated

714
00:32:08,143 --> 00:32:10,339
pretty seamlessly into our
existing scheduling model.

715
00:32:10,363 --> 00:32:13,385
Appointments in the morning,
walk-ins in the afternoon.

716
00:32:13,409 --> 00:32:15,822
Wow, so it's-it's working.

717
00:32:15,846 --> 00:32:18,869
Well, I had a patient today

718
00:32:18,893 --> 00:32:20,305
that had all but given up

719
00:32:20,329 --> 00:32:22,046
on scheduling appointments altogether.

720
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,656
You know, she works at a few
different restaurants,

721
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,832
picks up shifts,
doesn't know her schedule

722
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,922
till the night before,
and when she found out

723
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,849
that she could just walk in
when she was free,

724
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,275
we had a great session...

725
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:34,841
one that wouldn't have
been possible yesterday,

726
00:32:34,865 --> 00:32:37,888
so yeah, it's working.

727
00:32:37,912 --> 00:32:39,958
- Thank you.
- Knock knock.

728
00:32:41,829 --> 00:32:44,329
Hot off the presses. New survey scores.

729
00:32:44,353 --> 00:32:45,591
Oh, my God, you're killing me.

730
00:32:45,615 --> 00:32:47,245
- Ready for this?
- No.

731
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:49,868
Here we go.

732
00:32:50,577 --> 00:32:53,034
Okay, buddy. Survey says...

733
00:32:54,494 --> 00:32:55,495
Oof.

734
00:32:57,236 --> 00:32:58,604
It's 53%.

735
00:33:00,195 --> 00:33:02,172
Congratulations.

736
00:33:02,415 --> 00:33:04,069
Thank you.

737
00:33:05,331 --> 00:33:07,831
53%.

738
00:33:07,855 --> 00:33:10,347
Well, Max, you were right.

739
00:33:10,814 --> 00:33:13,228
Less satisfaction, but better health.

740
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,022
You know, I usually pride myself

741
00:33:25,046 --> 00:33:28,678
in listening to my patients,

742
00:33:28,702 --> 00:33:32,943
and what I, uh, heard from you

743
00:33:32,967 --> 00:33:36,207
is that because of your addiction,

744
00:33:36,231 --> 00:33:38,731
you believe that you lack the capacity

745
00:33:38,755 --> 00:33:40,559
to safely bring your baby to term.

746
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:42,187
And I get it.

747
00:33:42,585 --> 00:33:44,798
You know? That takes courage.

748
00:33:45,588 --> 00:33:47,926
But for nearly six months,

749
00:33:48,722 --> 00:33:51,309
you had it... courage.

750
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:54,225
Hey, it took courage
just showing up here

751
00:33:54,249 --> 00:33:56,643
and asking for help in the first place.

752
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,479
But you know what else I heard?

753
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,607
I heard from you that it's hard,

754
00:34:02,866 --> 00:34:04,757
maintaining this on your own.

755
00:34:04,781 --> 00:34:06,542
So my question for you, Olivette,

756
00:34:06,566 --> 00:34:08,152
is if you were capable,

757
00:34:08,176 --> 00:34:11,408
if you had the support that you needed,

758
00:34:11,962 --> 00:34:13,785
would you continue with your pregnancy?

759
00:34:15,009 --> 00:34:17,553
Oh, no, hey. No, I'm serious.

760
00:34:17,577 --> 00:34:20,500
In your heart, would you want
to carry your baby to term?

761
00:34:25,047 --> 00:34:26,353
Yes.

762
00:34:27,282 --> 00:34:28,738
Okay.

763
00:34:28,762 --> 00:34:31,741
Okay, so instead of committing you

764
00:34:31,765 --> 00:34:34,091
until you can safely deliver,

765
00:34:34,115 --> 00:34:36,789
I'm gonna make a commitment to you

766
00:34:36,813 --> 00:34:38,560
so that you can.

767
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:41,185
Now, you're gonna need prenatal care,

768
00:34:41,209 --> 00:34:43,927
proper nutrition, birthing classes,

769
00:34:43,951 --> 00:34:45,474
birthing coach,

770
00:34:45,775 --> 00:34:47,563
and you're also gonna need
to stay clean.

771
00:34:48,028 --> 00:34:49,652
That's most important.

772
00:34:49,946 --> 00:34:53,197
Now, I know none of this
will be easy, Olivette,

773
00:34:53,221 --> 00:34:55,852
so this time,
you're gonna have something

774
00:34:55,876 --> 00:34:56,940
you didn't have before.

775
00:34:56,964 --> 00:34:58,637
A sisterhood.

776
00:34:58,661 --> 00:35:01,466
Because if you need to go
to a meeting or an appointment,

777
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:02,859
I'm gonna go with you.

778
00:35:02,883 --> 00:35:06,546
And if Gabrielle can't,
I'm there for you.

779
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,997
And if neither of these
wonderful women are available,

780
00:35:11,021 --> 00:35:13,696
we've got nine others in this hospital

781
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,002
who are pledging to step in.

782
00:35:16,026 --> 00:35:17,874
And not just for you...

783
00:35:17,898 --> 00:35:19,136
for any other pregnant woman

784
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,206
who might be struggling on their own.

785
00:35:24,426 --> 00:35:26,665
And you still got that little
piece of paper he gave you?

786
00:35:39,659 --> 00:35:41,376
- A girl.
- Ooh.

787
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,029
Looks like she's gonna be a part

788
00:35:43,053 --> 00:35:44,422
of this sisterhood too.

789
00:35:52,628 --> 00:35:55,222
Hi, I'm home. Hey.

790
00:35:55,246 --> 00:35:56,565
Oh, hey, just in time.

791
00:35:56,589 --> 00:35:59,133
I... oh, I was fading.

792
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,222
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

793
00:36:01,246 --> 00:36:05,008
Oh, there was a tiff this evening.

794
00:36:05,032 --> 00:36:08,533
Um, Saleem accused Raffi of,

795
00:36:08,557 --> 00:36:12,058
and I quote, "Being really extra."

796
00:36:12,082 --> 00:36:14,452
Yeah, that is a lot coming from Saleem.

797
00:36:14,476 --> 00:36:15,758
Right? Uh, yeah.

798
00:36:15,782 --> 00:36:19,065
But on the plus side,
it exhausted everyone,

799
00:36:19,089 --> 00:36:20,719
and now they're peaceful,
sleeping angels.

800
00:36:20,743 --> 00:36:21,981
Okay.

801
00:36:22,005 --> 00:36:23,635
Chicken quesadillas in the fridge.

802
00:36:37,456 --> 00:36:41,392
Okay, I think we've covered
all aspects of the amended trust,

803
00:36:41,416 --> 00:36:43,916
and you are clear on your role
as executor, Lauren?

804
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:46,223
- I am.
- Good.

805
00:36:46,247 --> 00:36:48,467
Then that just leaves
the distribution of assets.

806
00:36:50,033 --> 00:36:51,402
"As my eldest daughter, Lauren,

807
00:36:51,426 --> 00:36:53,709
"worked tirelessly to help me in life,

808
00:36:53,733 --> 00:36:55,406
"in death, I, Jean Marie Bloom,

809
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:59,410
"bequeath my entire estate,
valued at over $7 million,

810
00:36:59,434 --> 00:37:02,500
to my youngest daughter,
Vanessa Pageant Bloom."

811
00:37:09,792 --> 00:37:12,031
Uh...

812
00:37:12,055 --> 00:37:13,492
well.

813
00:37:14,797 --> 00:37:17,344
Don't know about you,
Counselor, but, um,

814
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,472
I could use a drink.

815
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,272
Dad?

816
00:37:29,943 --> 00:37:31,983
- Hey.
- Hey.

817
00:37:32,728 --> 00:37:34,904
Fixed everything up?

818
00:37:35,195 --> 00:37:36,613
Yeah.

819
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,320
Was nothing I couldn't handle.

820
00:37:41,911 --> 00:37:43,759
Guess I shouldn't have doubted you.

821
00:37:43,783 --> 00:37:46,152
So what's in the bag?

822
00:37:46,176 --> 00:37:48,285
- What, this bag?
- Yeah.

823
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:50,156
Oh, just a little

824
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,158
New York Noodletown sumthin'-sumthin'.

825
00:37:52,182 --> 00:37:54,987
Ooh. You got the kung pao shrimp?

826
00:37:55,011 --> 00:37:56,859
Is water wet?

827
00:37:56,883 --> 00:37:58,469
That reminds me.

828
00:37:58,493 --> 00:37:59,818
I got a couple things I wanna do

829
00:37:59,842 --> 00:38:01,167
in that bathroom of yours.

830
00:38:01,191 --> 00:38:02,560
- Oh, don't tell me that.
- Hush.

831
00:38:02,584 --> 00:38:04,040
I just wanna re-caulk around the sink.

832
00:38:04,064 --> 00:38:05,781
Put in a a new shower head.

833
00:38:05,805 --> 00:38:07,807
Earn my keep around here.

834
00:38:09,983 --> 00:38:11,874
Sounds good, Pop.

835
00:38:11,898 --> 00:38:13,571
All right then.

836
00:38:13,595 --> 00:38:15,249
All right.

837
00:38:17,077 --> 00:38:19,795
All right, just gonna...
