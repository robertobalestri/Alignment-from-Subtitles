1
00:00:03,987 --> 00:00:05,326
<i>You know that story</i>

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,728
<i>where a child gets trapped under a car</i>

3
00:00:07,762 --> 00:00:09,900
<i>and their parent finds
the superhuman strength</i>

4
00:00:09,934 --> 00:00:12,314
<i>to lift the car
and save the child's life?</i>

5
00:00:12,969 --> 00:00:15,270
<i>I always wondered if that was real.</i>

6
00:00:16,506 --> 00:00:18,307
I mean, are you sure you
don't want me to go with you?

7
00:00:18,341 --> 00:00:19,575
I could go with you.

8
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:21,710
No, I'm fine. I'll just need a second.

9
00:00:21,745 --> 00:00:23,645
I could go with you. I have the day off.

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,580
And you need people.

11
00:00:24,614 --> 00:00:26,648
It's good to show them
that you have people.

12
00:00:26,683 --> 00:00:28,917
You don't want to look like
some lone-wolf assailant

13
00:00:28,952 --> 00:00:29,918
with no friends.

14
00:00:29,953 --> 00:00:32,061
Look, all they're doing
is setting a trial date.

15
00:00:32,095 --> 00:00:33,756
It'll take like 10 minutes.

16
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,758
T-The security line will take longer.

17
00:00:35,792 --> 00:00:38,293
- Stop fussing.
- Okay, fine.

18
00:00:38,328 --> 00:00:41,011
If you're sure, fine. Good luck.

19
00:00:41,664 --> 00:00:44,800
<i>If someone I cared about
was hurt or trapped,</i>

20
00:00:44,834 --> 00:00:46,802
<i>would</i> my <i>instincts kick in?</i>

21
00:00:46,836 --> 00:00:48,804
<i>Would I know what to do?</i>

22
00:00:48,838 --> 00:00:51,018
You want to sit a minute?

23
00:00:51,053 --> 00:00:53,275
No, I'm fine. I got to go. Bye.

24
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:55,477
Okay. Well, call me or text me.

25
00:00:55,512 --> 00:00:57,479
And try to come home early, okay?

26
00:00:57,514 --> 00:01:00,682
<i>Would I lift the car?
Jump in front of the bullet?</i>

27
00:01:00,717 --> 00:01:03,238
<i>Would I be able
to beat somebody senseless?</i>

28
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:04,872
<i>I like to think I would.</i>

29
00:01:04,907 --> 00:01:06,574
Alex?

30
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:09,510
Maybe we sit a minute.

31
00:01:09,545 --> 00:01:11,579
Okay.

32
00:01:25,227 --> 00:01:27,028
We have time.

33
00:01:38,941 --> 00:01:41,576
Well, I guess this line
could go slower. Except no.

34
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,212
There's no such thing as moving
slower than not moving at all.

35
00:01:44,246 --> 00:01:45,279
So never mind. I take it back.

36
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:47,481
Yeah, I thought half an hour
early would be enough.

37
00:01:47,516 --> 00:01:50,418
9/11, man. Everybody's a suspect now.

38
00:01:50,452 --> 00:01:53,421
Look at that lady.
Does she look dangerous to you?

39
00:01:53,455 --> 00:01:54,355
Not really.

40
00:01:54,389 --> 00:01:56,424
Maybe that guy
if you took his coffee away.

41
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:58,259
I look more dangerous than that guy,

42
00:01:58,293 --> 00:01:59,894
and I'm just here for traffic court.

43
00:01:59,928 --> 00:02:01,462
Contesting a ticket.

44
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:04,498
I totally didn't stop at the stop sign,

45
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:06,434
but I'm banking
on the cop not showing up.

46
00:02:06,468 --> 00:02:07,568
They almost never show.

47
00:02:07,603 --> 00:02:10,438
I do not have the money to
throw away on this right now.

48
00:02:10,472 --> 00:02:12,473
Just got knocked up.

49
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:14,742
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

50
00:02:14,776 --> 00:02:16,277
What are you in for?

51
00:02:16,311 --> 00:02:18,412
Just, uh, setting a trial date today.

52
00:02:18,447 --> 00:02:20,414
Trial date? Are you dangerous?

53
00:02:21,167 --> 00:02:22,549
How far along?

54
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:25,220
Oh, early still. 16 weeks.

55
00:02:25,554 --> 00:02:28,456
That, uh, redness on your hand,
you had it long?

56
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,359
Uh, like a week or so.

57
00:02:31,393 --> 00:02:34,328
Any unusual symptoms?
Uh, leg swelling, abdominal pain?

58
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:36,330
Okay, you definitely seem
a little weird now.

59
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:39,767
Sorry. It's a habit.
I'm a doctor at Grey Sloan.

60
00:02:39,801 --> 00:02:41,335
You should get that rash checked.

61
00:02:41,831 --> 00:02:43,337
Oh, no. I got to stick
to the budget right now.

62
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:44,972
I got enough doctor's visits coming up.

63
00:02:45,007 --> 00:02:46,140
I do not need to add more.

64
00:02:46,174 --> 00:02:49,066
You can afford to see me.
I work at the free clinic there.

65
00:02:50,792 --> 00:02:51,792
Damn it! I'm late.

66
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,250
Get that rash checked! Think about it!

67
00:02:58,587 --> 00:03:00,121
Yeah.

68
00:03:00,155 --> 00:03:01,789
That's me, the girl with the rash.

69
00:03:01,823 --> 00:03:03,524
Thanks.

70
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,027
They're setting the trial date
right now as we speak.

71
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:07,395
I'm still waiting to hear.

72
00:03:07,429 --> 00:03:09,297
Date? Wow. Makes it all feel so real.

73
00:03:09,331 --> 00:03:10,898
Yeah, and I know it's good news.

74
00:03:10,932 --> 00:03:13,134
It means the end's near,
but things finally

75
00:03:13,168 --> 00:03:15,336
just started feeling
more normal again around here.

76
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,704
Yeah, it brings it all right back up.

77
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,339
You still talk to Karev at all, or...?

78
00:03:18,373 --> 00:03:20,841
We don't talk.
We barely even see each other.

79
00:03:20,876 --> 00:03:23,844
It's a little like he and I
never even existed, so, yeah.

80
00:03:25,681 --> 00:03:27,515
I got to go. I'm on Bailey's service.

81
00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:29,517
Tell me if you talk to your lawyer.

82
00:03:29,551 --> 00:03:30,885
All right.

83
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,920
Robbins, have you met the new resident?

84
00:03:32,954 --> 00:03:35,256
She is great. No, amazing.

85
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,724
She's better than some of my attendings.

86
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:37,625
Whoa. Hold on a second.

87
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:39,393
I didn't even know
we got a new resident.

88
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:41,796
Yeah, Webber just hired her.
She's... Hold on.

89
00:03:45,067 --> 00:03:47,234
Dr. Robbins, this is...

90
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:48,202
Murphy!

91
00:03:48,236 --> 00:03:49,403
Dr. Robbins.

92
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:50,604
Hi.

93
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:52,173
You guys know each other?

94
00:03:52,207 --> 00:03:53,207
Um...

95
00:03:53,241 --> 00:03:53,974
Yes.

96
00:03:56,378 --> 00:04:00,247
Leah... D-D-Dr. Murphy used to...

97
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:01,615
I used to work here. Yes.

98
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,718
I have patients.

99
00:04:05,654 --> 00:04:09,790
You realize your shenanigans
this morning made me late.

100
00:04:09,825 --> 00:04:11,359
Well, you own the hospital.

101
00:04:11,393 --> 00:04:12,560
You can be as late as you want to.

102
00:04:12,594 --> 00:04:15,596
And you can't tell me my
"shenanigans" weren't worth it.

103
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,897
I don't like being late.

104
00:04:16,932 --> 00:04:18,099
Oh, big surgery?

105
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,266
Mm, meeting with Bailey.

106
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:20,634
- Oh, really? What about?
- Well...

107
00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:22,403
You hired Leah Murphy back?

108
00:04:22,437 --> 00:04:24,472
Why? Why? Why? W-Why would you do that?

109
00:04:24,506 --> 00:04:26,707
Well, with Blake gone,
it seemed like perfect timing.

110
00:04:26,742 --> 00:04:28,976
I thought you fired her because she
wasn't cut out to be a surgeon.

111
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,911
Yeah, why <i>would</i> you bring her back?

112
00:04:30,946 --> 00:04:33,114
Well, she did the work
to prove me wrong,

113
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:35,916
and Foster's Residency Director
said she excelled there,

114
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:38,085
and I think she deserved
a second chance.

115
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,787
What? Don't you believe
in second chances?

116
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:40,688
No!

117
00:04:43,358 --> 00:04:46,560
I mean. Mm!

118
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:51,298
Hey. I'm just headed up to surgery.

119
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:54,068
Just wanted to say good morning.
You were gone when I got up.

120
00:04:54,102 --> 00:04:56,771
Yeah, early surgery.

121
00:04:56,805 --> 00:05:00,174
Listen, you, uh... you want
to talk later, maybe, or...?

122
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,543
- I mean, we didn't last night.
- Nope!

123
00:05:04,212 --> 00:05:07,181
Amelia, people don't always
get pregnant their first try,

124
00:05:07,215 --> 00:05:09,250
and I just don't want you to feel...

125
00:05:09,284 --> 00:05:10,618
Are you kidding? I am fine.

126
00:05:10,652 --> 00:05:11,852
- R... You're fine?
- Yeah, I'm good.

127
00:05:11,887 --> 00:05:14,188
I'm great, even. Yeah, for sure.

128
00:05:14,222 --> 00:05:15,656
That's... that's... that's good.

129
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,824
That's good that you're so good.

130
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,493
Incoming! Any second. MVC.

131
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:20,361
Kid with possible head trauma,

132
00:05:20,395 --> 00:05:22,329
dad with multiple abdominal injuries.

133
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:24,432
- We could use neuro.
- Right behind you.

134
00:05:24,466 --> 00:05:25,766
Mm.

135
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:28,302
Robbie Reeves, 12, MVC.

136
00:05:28,336 --> 00:05:30,638
Restrained passenger. Vitals stable.

137
00:05:30,672 --> 00:05:33,174
No L.O.C. on the scene.
Small scalp laceration.

138
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,708
It was like a roller coaster!

139
00:05:34,743 --> 00:05:36,343
All right. Robbie, I'm Dr. Shepherd.

140
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:38,145
Where's my dad? I got to ask
him how fast we were going.

141
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,713
It looks like he's pulling in
right behind you.

142
00:05:39,748 --> 00:05:41,949
- Your head's hurting?
- Barely. Can I ask him?

143
00:05:41,983 --> 00:05:43,517
Yeah, in a minute.
I'm gonna check you out first.

144
00:05:46,855 --> 00:05:49,023
Bob Reeves, 40's, the driver.

145
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,791
Some abdominal bruising, tenuous B.P.,

146
00:05:50,826 --> 00:05:52,193
large wounds on the left leg.

147
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,361
Robbie?! Where's my son?

148
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:55,729
Somebody tell me if my son is here.

149
00:05:55,764 --> 00:05:58,065
Sir, he's here.
They just took him inside, okay?

150
00:05:58,099 --> 00:05:59,800
Okay. Okay. Good. Thank you.

151
00:05:59,835 --> 00:06:01,635
- Aah!
- You got some nasty bruising.

152
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,737
You got pretty banged up
out there, Mr. Reeves.

153
00:06:03,772 --> 00:06:05,039
You should see my car.

154
00:06:09,678 --> 00:06:11,545
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

155
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,082
All right. Contact dermatitis, bed 4.

156
00:06:15,116 --> 00:06:17,318
Hey, look who showed up.

157
00:06:17,352 --> 00:06:19,053
Well, I can't be the pregnant lady

158
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,088
who ignores unsolicited medical advice.

159
00:06:21,122 --> 00:06:22,690
That lady's a jerk.

160
00:06:22,724 --> 00:06:24,158
Let's see this rash.

161
00:06:24,192 --> 00:06:25,893
That's all it was, right?
Medical advice?

162
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,495
Because if you got me all worried

163
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:29,663
just to get a date or get in
some pregnant lady's pants,

164
00:06:29,698 --> 00:06:31,432
that would make you the jerk.

165
00:06:31,466 --> 00:06:33,067
Just doing my job... promise.

166
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,236
How long have your hands been itching?

167
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,605
Uh, like a week, maybe more.

168
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:40,908
Not that I'm not available.
I am, or, uh, I could be.

169
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,744
A baby belly doesn't
exactly equal baby daddy.

170
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:44,678
There is a baby daddy.

171
00:06:44,713 --> 00:06:46,413
He's just not attached,
I mean, not to me.

172
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:48,682
- You don't have to explain.
- I kind of do.

173
00:06:48,717 --> 00:06:50,718
Hospitals give me the creeps,
so talking helps.

174
00:06:50,752 --> 00:06:52,686
Okay, so, there's a baby daddy.

175
00:06:52,721 --> 00:06:54,388
Jeremy... my best friend
since we were kids.

176
00:06:54,422 --> 00:06:56,390
We made one of those pacts...
you know, if we both wound up

177
00:06:56,424 --> 00:06:58,125
single at 40, we'd make a baby.

178
00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:00,127
I always thought it would be
needles and test tubes,

179
00:07:00,161 --> 00:07:01,629
but turns out that's really pricy.

180
00:07:01,663 --> 00:07:04,031
Yeah, it's up there. Look this way.

181
00:07:06,265 --> 00:07:07,841
Look the other way.

182
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,737
All right, good.

183
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:12,973
So, one night, there was
a lot of tequila, and boom...

184
00:07:13,008 --> 00:07:15,376
I got this little parasite
that sucks all my energy.

185
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,478
Silver lining, though... I've
actually been losing weight.

186
00:07:17,512 --> 00:07:19,046
I always thought
that would go the other way.

187
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,648
You're losing weight. How much?

188
00:07:20,682 --> 00:07:23,128
Um, I don't know, enough to drop a size.

189
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,719
What? What's that look?

190
00:07:25,754 --> 00:07:26,654
Just want to run some tests.

191
00:07:26,688 --> 00:07:28,489
Can you hang out here for a while today?

192
00:07:28,523 --> 00:07:29,623
You know, you got me worried again.

193
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,625
Is there something wrong?
Should I call the baby daddy?

194
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,962
Well, if you're stuck here,
a little company couldn't hurt.

195
00:07:37,766 --> 00:07:39,433
You've made no move to fire Karev.

196
00:07:39,467 --> 00:07:42,269
There's no replacement surgeon.
What is the plan?

197
00:07:42,304 --> 00:07:44,305
Karev's been removed
from the surgical service

198
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,406
pending his trial.

199
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,475
I don't understand why he's
still working here at all.

200
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,743
If a doctor on our staff

201
00:07:49,778 --> 00:07:51,745
has been charged with a felony assault,

202
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,414
he should not be a doctor on our staff.

203
00:07:53,448 --> 00:07:55,316
Well, he's innocent until proven guilty.

204
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,151
We have a justice system.

205
00:07:57,185 --> 00:08:00,354
I don't want to throw away
a good surgeon's career

206
00:08:00,388 --> 00:08:01,755
because of one mistake.

207
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,757
I know. That's your tendency.

208
00:08:03,792 --> 00:08:06,093
That's my tenden... What's my tendency?

209
00:08:06,127 --> 00:08:09,129
Leniency. You have
a tendency towards leniency.

210
00:08:09,164 --> 00:08:11,198
- Are you joking?
- Mnhmnh.

211
00:08:11,746 --> 00:08:14,079
You know what my nickname used to be?

212
00:08:14,903 --> 00:08:15,836
They called me the Na...

213
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,944
Benjamin Warren.

214
00:08:21,341 --> 00:08:23,711
Dr. Bailey, I believe in you.

215
00:08:23,745 --> 00:08:25,145
I think you have

216
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,815
an extraordinary future ahead of you.

217
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:29,483
And I wouldn't dream of coming in here

218
00:08:29,517 --> 00:08:32,353
and telling you how to do your job.

219
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:34,655
But if you don't take some steps

220
00:08:34,689 --> 00:08:36,743
to replace Dr. Karev...

221
00:08:37,859 --> 00:08:39,377
I will.

00:08:54,828 --> 00:08:57,263
- You paged?
- Uh, yeah, come take a look.

224
00:08:57,297 --> 00:08:58,464
All right, assist the head lac.

225
00:08:58,498 --> 00:09:01,133
Sir, I'm gonna need to take
a look at your wound, okay?

226
00:09:01,168 --> 00:09:02,768
Okay, that's really deep.

227
00:09:02,803 --> 00:09:04,503
We're gonna need to get this debrided

228
00:09:04,538 --> 00:09:06,605
and covered with a local
muscle flap right away.

229
00:09:07,276 --> 00:09:08,602
Looks like he took a beating.

230
00:09:08,636 --> 00:09:10,743
Car hit the median.
They're lucky everyone survived.

231
00:09:10,777 --> 00:09:12,011
My kid was in the car with me.

232
00:09:12,045 --> 00:09:13,145
This guy was all over the road.

233
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,781
- There's blood in his abdomen.
- Better book the C.T.

234
00:09:15,816 --> 00:09:17,349
Three lanes he whipped
across just to cut me off.

235
00:09:17,384 --> 00:09:19,618
I mean, what the hell? Who does that?

236
00:09:19,653 --> 00:09:21,487
Oh, God. Robbie.

237
00:09:21,521 --> 00:09:23,923
What's happening with my son?
Is he okay?

238
00:09:23,957 --> 00:09:27,593
We passed a bunch of cars, and
we kept going faster and faster!

239
00:09:27,627 --> 00:09:30,162
Follow my finger with your eyes.

240
00:09:31,531 --> 00:09:32,998
Ow.

241
00:09:33,033 --> 00:09:34,600
That is quite a cut
you've got there, Robbie.

242
00:09:34,634 --> 00:09:36,368
- Does it hurt?
- I can take it.

243
00:09:36,403 --> 00:09:40,039
Is my dad okay? 'Cause
I should probably check on him.

244
00:09:40,073 --> 00:09:40,940
Right.

245
00:09:40,974 --> 00:09:42,808
I mean, he's my dad.

246
00:09:43,877 --> 00:09:45,344
Ow.

247
00:09:47,514 --> 00:09:49,215
- You okay, Robbie?
- I'm fine, Dad.

248
00:09:49,249 --> 00:09:51,283
- Thanks for waiting.
- Oh, it's fine.

249
00:09:51,318 --> 00:09:54,553
Jackson can cool his heels for
a few more minutes upstairs.

250
00:09:54,588 --> 00:09:57,122
I'm not hurt. I'm really okay, Dad.

251
00:09:57,157 --> 00:09:59,058
Mom's on her way, buddy, okay?

252
00:09:59,092 --> 00:10:00,960
Listen to the doctors
until she gets here.

253
00:10:00,994 --> 00:10:02,027
You hear me? Behave.

254
00:10:02,062 --> 00:10:05,059
I always behave, not like
that jerk that cut us off.

255
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:07,092
I bet next time he will think twice.

256
00:10:07,127 --> 00:10:08,704
I bet we <i>did</i> teach him some manners.

257
00:10:08,739 --> 00:10:09,979
All right, all right.
Buddy, that's enough.

258
00:10:10,004 --> 00:10:11,786
All right, Dad.

259
00:10:15,096 --> 00:10:16,663
I paged Bailey over an hour ago.

260
00:10:16,697 --> 00:10:19,499
How long does it take to walk
over to the damn clinic?

261
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:23,356
Uh, what are you doing?

262
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,634
I'm sorry. I'm nervous.

263
00:10:24,668 --> 00:10:25,862
I am, too, but boundaries, remember?

264
00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:27,856
I can't hold your hand?
I've held your boobs.

265
00:10:27,891 --> 00:10:29,825
Can we please not talk about
how the sausage is made?

266
00:10:29,859 --> 00:10:31,593
Can we not call our baby a sausage?

267
00:10:31,628 --> 00:10:33,028
Sorry, guys, just another minute.

268
00:10:33,062 --> 00:10:35,998
And, by the way, you said it was lovely.

269
00:10:36,032 --> 00:10:37,099
It was, in its own way.

270
00:10:37,133 --> 00:10:39,434
I also said let's never
speak of it again, remember?

271
00:10:43,072 --> 00:10:44,273
So, what was all that about?

272
00:10:44,307 --> 00:10:45,340
Is there something we need to know?

273
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,943
Yes, but I need a surgeon
to officially assess you,

274
00:10:47,977 --> 00:10:49,211
and I can't seem to get one.

275
00:10:49,245 --> 00:10:53,382
So if you guys could just hang
tight, I'll be right back, okay?

276
00:11:05,628 --> 00:11:08,263
Hey. My bladder rupture repair...
done and done.

277
00:11:08,298 --> 00:11:10,699
And I'm about to scrub in
on a nasty volvulus.

278
00:11:10,733 --> 00:11:12,701
- What do you got?
- A kid in a car accident.

279
00:11:12,735 --> 00:11:14,436
- Hm.
- He's lucky, though.

280
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,470
I-I'm not seeing much of anything,

281
00:11:15,505 --> 00:11:18,707
just a small congenital AVM,
nothing to do there.

282
00:11:18,741 --> 00:11:21,577
If he's clear in a few hours,
I'll send him home.

283
00:11:21,611 --> 00:11:23,178
Hey, you got a minute to talk?

284
00:11:24,581 --> 00:11:25,814
Owen, there's nothing to talk about.

285
00:11:25,848 --> 00:11:28,884
But you love to talk, and you're
not talking about this at all.

286
00:11:28,918 --> 00:11:30,619
Hear my words and just
take them at face value.

287
00:11:30,653 --> 00:11:32,487
And I know I wouldn't mind talking.

288
00:11:32,522 --> 00:11:35,657
I am fine. It's j-just...
Why the rush, you know?

289
00:11:35,692 --> 00:11:37,726
What?

290
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,494
Well, I mean, w-we were barely engaged,

291
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:40,694
and now we're barely married,

292
00:11:40,728 --> 00:11:42,164
and we're already trying for kids?

293
00:11:42,198 --> 00:11:45,133
Why all the pressure?
Let's just be us for a minute.

294
00:11:45,168 --> 00:11:47,669
You know, enjoy us
and feel what it's like

295
00:11:47,704 --> 00:11:52,674
to be two people
in a marriage, newlyweds,

296
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:54,076
before we add to it, right?

297
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,601
Is, um...

298
00:11:57,981 --> 00:11:59,581
If that's what you want.

299
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,817
Great.

300
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,290
She gave you an ultimatum?

301
00:12:08,324 --> 00:12:11,293
Mm-hmm. And she called me lenient.

302
00:12:11,327 --> 00:12:12,594
Lenient!

303
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:13,595
<i>You</i> were lenient.

304
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,864
I was not. I was not lenient.

305
00:12:15,898 --> 00:12:17,165
Yes, you were.

306
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,370
You were a lenient and kind
and wise chief

307
00:12:21,404 --> 00:12:22,638
who ruled with fairness.

308
00:12:22,672 --> 00:12:25,607
Yes, I was fair. I was fair-minded.

309
00:12:25,642 --> 00:12:27,476
"Lenient" makes me sound weak.

310
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,243
I know.

311
00:12:28,277 --> 00:12:30,112
And I believe in second chances.

312
00:12:30,146 --> 00:12:33,649
Look at Leah Murphy.
She persevered, and she improved.

313
00:12:33,683 --> 00:12:34,683
She asked to come back.

314
00:12:34,717 --> 00:12:37,653
I feel that kind of fortitude
is to be rewarded.

315
00:12:37,687 --> 00:12:40,355
And more so, I believe
it will reward <i>us.</i>

316
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,724
That's how I feel about Karev.

317
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:44,126
And I'm right.

318
00:12:46,929 --> 00:12:48,363
Right?

319
00:12:48,398 --> 00:12:50,065
You have to decide that.

320
00:12:50,547 --> 00:12:52,901
I mean, that's why they call
them the tough calls, Bailey.

321
00:12:52,935 --> 00:12:54,403
"That's why they call them
the tough calls"?

322
00:12:54,437 --> 00:12:56,672
That's all you got?
I just called you wise.

323
00:12:57,171 --> 00:12:58,574
Heads up.

324
00:12:58,608 --> 00:13:00,575
Look, the clinic is a joke, I know,

325
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,210
and nobody wants to go over there.

326
00:13:02,245 --> 00:13:03,578
But it's not a joke when a pregnant lady

327
00:13:03,613 --> 00:13:05,547
has to wait over an hour
for someone to come over

328
00:13:05,581 --> 00:13:07,582
and confirm that she has cancer.

329
00:13:07,617 --> 00:13:09,551
I've paged you multiple times.

330
00:13:09,585 --> 00:13:10,752
I'm the Chief of Surgery.

331
00:13:10,787 --> 00:13:12,521
Why aren't you paging a resident?

332
00:13:12,555 --> 00:13:14,523
I want <i>you,</i> the surgeon
with the most expertise

333
00:13:14,557 --> 00:13:16,091
to give this patient the best chance.

334
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,860
Look, you stuck me over there.
It's your freakin' clinic.

335
00:13:18,895 --> 00:13:21,358
At least have the decency
to answer your own damn pages.

336
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:25,500
Not today, Karev. You do not
want to push me today.

337
00:13:25,535 --> 00:13:27,235
Meet you there in 5.

338
00:13:32,642 --> 00:13:35,777
You were saying about
not wanting to fire him?

339
00:13:43,984 --> 00:13:46,219
- Hey.
- Hi.

340
00:13:46,253 --> 00:13:47,921
I'm on Dr. Bailey's service, so...

341
00:13:47,955 --> 00:13:49,456
Right.

342
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,758
- I'm Dr. Bailey.
- Hi. Jeremy.

343
00:13:51,792 --> 00:13:54,561
Wow. This is a lot of fuss
for just a rash.

344
00:13:54,595 --> 00:13:56,029
Okay.

345
00:13:56,698 --> 00:13:58,030
So hit me.

346
00:13:59,133 --> 00:14:02,068
Um, the symptoms
that Dr. Karev noticed...

347
00:14:02,102 --> 00:14:04,037
your weight loss,
the itching on your hands...

348
00:14:04,071 --> 00:14:07,207
when we see those symptoms
together, it's a red flag.

349
00:14:07,241 --> 00:14:09,709
So, we took a look at your MRI

350
00:14:09,743 --> 00:14:12,378
and detected a mass on your pancreas.

351
00:14:12,413 --> 00:14:15,448
Oh, God. It is... cancer?

352
00:14:15,483 --> 00:14:17,784
It's too soon to know for sure.

353
00:14:17,818 --> 00:14:18,985
But it could be?

354
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:21,087
We'll need to do a biopsy to confirm,

355
00:14:21,121 --> 00:14:22,222
and we can go from there.

356
00:14:22,786 --> 00:14:25,425
And you figured all this out
just by looking at my hands.

357
00:14:25,459 --> 00:14:27,060
I was hoping I was wrong.

358
00:14:27,094 --> 00:14:28,553
Still am.

359
00:14:29,497 --> 00:14:30,964
You and me both.

360
00:14:32,576 --> 00:14:35,752
All right, let's
get some irrigation in here.

361
00:14:36,103 --> 00:14:38,004
I don't get road rage.
Do you get road rage?

362
00:14:38,038 --> 00:14:40,139
Well, I don't chase
people down. I'm not crazy.

363
00:14:40,174 --> 00:14:41,341
Yeah, but other people.

364
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:42,742
- Oh, other people are crazy.
- Yeah.

365
00:14:42,776 --> 00:14:45,245
Well, actually sometimes,
April, you get a little crazy.

366
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,413
What? Warren, bovie this.

367
00:14:47,448 --> 00:14:49,415
Well, somebody cuts you off
in traffic, you unleash

368
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:52,085
a stream of obscenities that'll
tear the paint off the walls.

369
00:14:52,119 --> 00:14:53,786
Kepner? Really?

370
00:14:53,821 --> 00:14:56,089
Well, it's just a release.
They can't hear me.

371
00:14:56,116 --> 00:14:57,283
- Yeah, they just think
you're on the phone. - Yeah.

372
00:14:57,324 --> 00:14:59,292
Oh, God, you don't do that with
Harriet in the car, do you?

373
00:14:59,326 --> 00:15:00,760
No, never. I would never.

374
00:15:00,794 --> 00:15:01,728
Oh, and you can't honk.

375
00:15:01,762 --> 00:15:03,363
I mean, that just makes
crazy people crazier.

376
00:15:03,397 --> 00:15:05,365
No, no honking, not ever.

377
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:07,000
And when I flip someone off,
I always do it

378
00:15:07,034 --> 00:15:08,701
below the dash,
where they can't even see it.

379
00:15:08,736 --> 00:15:09,602
- You know?
- Mmhmm.

380
00:15:09,637 --> 00:15:11,079
Or maybe you don't do anything.

381
00:15:13,374 --> 00:15:15,008
Solid advice.

382
00:15:15,042 --> 00:15:17,134
Absolutely. Clamp.

383
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:19,612
♪ Mm-mm-mm-mm

384
00:15:19,647 --> 00:15:22,015
♪ Mm-mm-mm-mmm

385
00:15:22,049 --> 00:15:23,365
You're not even chewing.

386
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:26,753
I'm hungry, no time.
Waiting on biopsy results.

387
00:15:27,521 --> 00:15:29,289
Did Pierce tell you about
her new favorite resident?

388
00:15:29,323 --> 00:15:30,857
I can't operate, so I don't care.

389
00:15:30,891 --> 00:15:32,725
I mean, technically,
it's an old resident.

390
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,193
Leah Murphy.

391
00:15:34,228 --> 00:15:36,162
- She's back?
- I love her.

392
00:15:36,196 --> 00:15:38,965
Really great suture techniques,
steady hands.

393
00:15:41,201 --> 00:15:42,502
How are you?

394
00:15:42,536 --> 00:15:44,804
Great. Married.

395
00:15:44,838 --> 00:15:48,074
Newlywed of two months going strong.

396
00:15:48,108 --> 00:15:49,275
Super strong.

397
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:52,145
Can Webber really rehire her?
I mean, I am on the board.

398
00:15:52,179 --> 00:15:53,513
What is the problem?

399
00:15:53,547 --> 00:15:55,882
We needed a new resident,
and she's a good one.

400
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,150
Robbins slept with her.

401
00:15:57,184 --> 00:15:58,151
So did Alex.

402
00:15:58,185 --> 00:16:00,386
If you go there, be careful.
She gets attached.

403
00:16:00,421 --> 00:16:01,554
Excuse me.

404
00:16:03,257 --> 00:16:05,191
- Have you seen her yet?
- No.

405
00:16:05,225 --> 00:16:07,327
I mean, do you think it's weird
she hasn't called us

406
00:16:07,361 --> 00:16:08,895
to let us know she's coming back?

407
00:16:08,929 --> 00:16:11,030
- Who's back?
- Leah Murphy.

408
00:16:11,065 --> 00:16:12,865
She was in our intern class,

409
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,400
and then she left in the
second year of the program.

410
00:16:14,435 --> 00:16:16,703
- Not by choice.
- Oh, what happened?

411
00:16:16,737 --> 00:16:18,371
She didn't fight hard enough
to get in the O.R.

412
00:16:18,405 --> 00:16:20,406
- or study or prepare.
- Yes, she did.

413
00:16:20,441 --> 00:16:21,874
She drilled through a patient's leg

414
00:16:21,909 --> 00:16:23,176
all the way down to the table.

415
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,243
- Yikes.
- Mmhmm.

416
00:16:24,278 --> 00:16:26,579
- That was an accident. Did
- I also mention she almost

417
00:16:26,614 --> 00:16:28,781
brought the hospital down
with harassment lawsuits

418
00:16:28,816 --> 00:16:30,249
and complaints against attendings

419
00:16:30,284 --> 00:16:33,119
because she was sleeping
with attendings?

420
00:16:33,153 --> 00:16:34,520
Well, in fairness,
I slept with an attending.

421
00:16:34,555 --> 00:16:36,189
<i>Attendings.</i>

422
00:16:36,223 --> 00:16:37,790
Both Robbins and Karev.

423
00:16:37,825 --> 00:16:39,525
- Robbins <i>and</i> Karev?
- Don't remind me.

424
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,295
Not that I care, but still,
just don't remind me.

425
00:16:42,329 --> 00:16:44,230
It all screwed with her head,
so Webber asked her to leave.

426
00:16:44,264 --> 00:16:46,299
Just goes to show...
don't crap where you eat.

427
00:16:48,969 --> 00:16:51,371
Hey, guys! Someone sitting here?

428
00:16:51,405 --> 00:16:53,239
Hi!

429
00:16:53,273 --> 00:16:54,540
No, sit.

430
00:16:54,575 --> 00:16:55,575
Um, we were just talking...

431
00:16:55,609 --> 00:16:59,112
Talking about me? Figures.

432
00:17:00,748 --> 00:17:03,549
Um, anyway, uh, welcome back.

433
00:17:15,162 --> 00:17:16,496
Damn it.

434
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:18,731
Advanced pancreatic cancer.

435
00:17:18,766 --> 00:17:22,902
I say we start with
neoadjuvant chemoradiation.

436
00:17:22,936 --> 00:17:26,639
Hope it'll shrink the tumor,
then we can resect it.

437
00:17:26,674 --> 00:17:28,174
Follow up with more chemo.

438
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,776
But, uh, but she's pregnant.

439
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:32,278
How can the fetus survive
that kind of chemo?

440
00:17:32,312 --> 00:17:33,146
It can't.

441
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,847
We'll have to recommend termination.

442
00:17:34,882 --> 00:17:37,183
If we can schedule it
for this afternoon,

443
00:17:37,217 --> 00:17:39,919
we could start the first cycle
of chemo as early as tomorrow.

444
00:17:39,953 --> 00:17:41,521
This isn't some accidental pregnancy.

445
00:17:41,555 --> 00:17:43,256
There has to be some other option.

446
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:45,291
This is the best option.

447
00:17:45,325 --> 00:17:46,959
You don't know that.
Y-You don't know her.

448
00:17:46,994 --> 00:17:49,262
I know what I'm looking at
on these scans.

449
00:17:49,296 --> 00:17:51,130
Then look harder.
I mean, there has to be some...

450
00:17:51,165 --> 00:17:52,865
Okay, you marched across the street.

451
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,635
You yelled at me to come
and assess your patient.

452
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:57,203
Me. Nobody else would do.

453
00:17:57,237 --> 00:17:59,439
And now I'm here. I am assessing.

454
00:17:59,473 --> 00:18:01,274
I can't help it if you
don't like what you hear.

455
00:18:01,308 --> 00:18:02,975
I convinced her to come to our clinic.

456
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:04,277
I told her that we could help her.

457
00:18:04,311 --> 00:18:06,379
It's pancreatic cancer.

458
00:18:06,413 --> 00:18:08,281
There's only so much help we can give.

459
00:18:08,315 --> 00:18:09,048
You're not even trying.

460
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:12,151
Okay, you are on thin ice, Karev.

461
00:18:12,186 --> 00:18:16,189
Thin. This is not the time to get...

462
00:18:16,223 --> 00:18:19,325
I am the surgeon.
I know my recommendation.

463
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:21,627
We're done here.

464
00:18:28,102 --> 00:18:31,526
Robbie, I have some good news.
Your dad's out of surgery.

465
00:18:31,553 --> 00:18:32,812
So as soon as your mom gets here,

466
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:34,073
she can bring you up to see him.

467
00:18:34,108 --> 00:18:36,309
My mom will be pretty happy about that.

468
00:18:36,343 --> 00:18:38,311
Yeah, I bet she will.

469
00:18:38,345 --> 00:18:40,220
She's probably pretty scared.

470
00:18:41,915 --> 00:18:43,216
I bet she is.

471
00:18:46,386 --> 00:18:48,955
Robbie...

472
00:18:50,424 --> 00:18:52,258
If you are scared, it's okay.

473
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:55,061
I mean, it's all right to be scared.

474
00:18:55,095 --> 00:18:57,830
It's all right to say you are,
talk about it.

475
00:19:00,467 --> 00:19:02,401
He got so mad.

476
00:19:02,436 --> 00:19:05,404
Yeah. It's okay.

477
00:19:05,439 --> 00:19:07,006
And we went so fast.

478
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,108
I thought we were gonna go off the road.

479
00:19:09,143 --> 00:19:11,043
I thought we'd die.

480
00:19:11,078 --> 00:19:13,045
I just want my mom.

481
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,415
She's coming. She's on her way.

482
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:18,329
And you're safe now, okay?

483
00:19:20,896 --> 00:19:23,055
Okay? Robbie?

484
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:25,057
- I just want...
- What's that?

485
00:19:25,092 --> 00:19:27,460
- Hurts...
- Robbie? Do you know where you are?

486
00:19:27,494 --> 00:19:28,861
Can you squeeze my hands?

487
00:19:30,497 --> 00:19:32,365
Okay, I'm right here with you,
and I'm gonna help you.

488
00:19:32,399 --> 00:19:34,367
- Dr. Shepherd, this is Robbie's
- ...Warren, get in here!

489
00:19:34,401 --> 00:19:36,402
Robbie? We need some help in here!
Get her out of here.

490
00:19:36,436 --> 00:19:39,205
- What's happening? What's happening?
- Listen, ma'am. We need you to step back.

491
00:19:39,239 --> 00:19:41,274
Okay, somebody call upstairs.

492
00:19:41,308 --> 00:19:43,376
Bump whoever's in C.T. out.
We're coming up there now.

493
00:19:44,812 --> 00:19:45,745
Let's go.

494
00:19:47,181 --> 00:19:49,482
W-What's wrong with him?
T-They said he was fine.

495
00:19:49,516 --> 00:19:51,617
And he was, but I really have to go now.

496
00:19:55,582 --> 00:19:57,795
His C.T. was fine.
No contusion, no fracture.

497
00:19:57,869 --> 00:19:59,136
He has an incidental AVM
in the left temporal.

498
00:19:59,188 --> 00:20:01,729
- It must have ruptured.
- If his AVM ruptured, that's bad, right?

499
00:20:01,754 --> 00:20:03,241
- Really bad.
- I want an O.R. on standby.

500
00:20:03,275 --> 00:20:05,332
Make that happen right now.

501
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:09,348
Robbie's in surgery?

502
00:20:09,382 --> 00:20:11,317
Yeah, he had a brain bleed.

503
00:20:11,351 --> 00:20:13,219
They took him up as soon
as they detected it.

504
00:20:15,555 --> 00:20:17,489
Today was supposed to be a good one.

505
00:20:17,524 --> 00:20:20,326
Robbie said he wanted me to
take him to buy a comic book.

506
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,329
Yeah, t-that kind of thing
doesn't happen much anymore.

507
00:20:23,363 --> 00:20:25,564
He's 12 now.

508
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,468
And everything I do
pretty much embarrasses him.

509
00:20:29,502 --> 00:20:33,639
But today, when that guy
cut me off, I was so pissed.

510
00:20:34,114 --> 00:20:36,041
I mean, he could have killed us.

511
00:20:36,076 --> 00:20:37,576
I just... I took off after him,

512
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:40,145
and then we hit a slick spot
and we lost control.

513
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,774
We hit the wall.

514
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:47,046
He's with Dr. Shepherd now.
And she's excellent.

515
00:20:47,687 --> 00:20:50,522
Hey, sweetie. How's Robbie?

516
00:20:50,557 --> 00:20:52,658
There's no news. He's still in surgery.

517
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,894
Bob, what happened?

518
00:20:55,929 --> 00:20:58,230
I don't understand.

519
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,834
I'll check back in a few.

520
00:21:05,572 --> 00:21:09,545
This guy cut me off,
and I just got so mad.

521
00:21:26,126 --> 00:21:28,794
I'm sorry, but it sounds like

522
00:21:28,828 --> 00:21:31,697
- you want me to terminate my pregnancy.
- Oh, man.

523
00:21:31,731 --> 00:21:34,066
We need to begin treatments
as soon as possible.

524
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,801
And the baby couldn't survive them.

525
00:21:35,835 --> 00:21:37,171
So, the baby's healthy.

526
00:21:37,837 --> 00:21:39,672
The thing that's wrong here
is me, right?

527
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,476
Well, how much time do I get?

528
00:21:43,501 --> 00:21:45,711
I mean, if I do what you're asking

529
00:21:45,745 --> 00:21:48,614
and I get all the treatments,
how much time will I have?

530
00:21:51,785 --> 00:21:53,218
Less than a year.

531
00:21:57,424 --> 00:21:58,568
Then what is the point?

532
00:21:59,528 --> 00:22:01,727
Why can't we just wait
until after the baby's born,

533
00:22:01,761 --> 00:22:04,163
and then you can nuke my body
full of chemo all you want?

534
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:06,732
You're not listening.
She's not listening.

535
00:22:08,134 --> 00:22:09,432
They're saying...

536
00:22:10,659 --> 00:22:13,739
that without the treatments,
the cancer will kill you

537
00:22:13,773 --> 00:22:14,740
before the baby's even born.

538
00:22:14,774 --> 00:22:17,710
In a month, two months,
you'll both be dead.

539
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:24,783
I went to court to fight
a traffic ticket

540
00:22:24,818 --> 00:22:27,086
so I could save $360

541
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,755
so we could buy
an organic crib mattress.

542
00:22:29,789 --> 00:22:33,892
This is how my day started.
And now I'm...

543
00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:40,265
All day long, I have been
thinking that there is...

544
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,035
there's a reason
that I was in that line.

545
00:22:43,069 --> 00:22:44,603
There's a reason that I met you.

546
00:22:44,637 --> 00:22:47,139
And I don't believe in God
or fate or anything.

547
00:22:47,173 --> 00:22:48,507
She doesn't at all.

548
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:49,575
But this is it?

549
00:22:49,609 --> 00:22:53,679
I met you so you can tell me
that our baby has to die

550
00:22:53,713 --> 00:22:57,583
and then go crawl off somewhere
and die myself.

551
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,249
These are my options?

552
00:23:03,156 --> 00:23:04,372
Just death?

553
00:23:04,991 --> 00:23:06,525
And more death?

554
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,829
- What about a Whipple?
- A Whipple?

555
00:23:10,864 --> 00:23:12,197
A what?

556
00:23:12,989 --> 00:23:15,968
The baby wouldn't survive
being under that long.

557
00:23:16,002 --> 00:23:18,237
Then we do it open.
Cut the time in half.

558
00:23:18,767 --> 00:23:20,873
We forgo the first round of chemo

559
00:23:20,907 --> 00:23:22,207
and do this surgery instead.

560
00:23:22,242 --> 00:23:23,809
Remove the cancer from your pancreas

561
00:23:23,843 --> 00:23:25,811
without harming the baby,
then close you up.

562
00:23:25,845 --> 00:23:28,847
A-And that will save them...
that will save them both?

563
00:23:29,088 --> 00:23:31,383
No, but it could
keep you alive long enough

564
00:23:31,418 --> 00:23:32,918
to deliver a healthy baby.

565
00:23:32,952 --> 00:23:34,353
It'll buy you both some time.

566
00:23:34,387 --> 00:23:35,521
Dr. Karev.

567
00:23:36,856 --> 00:23:41,026
What the hell? You are not some
hotshot surgeon right now.

568
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,694
You are a doctor in the clinic.

569
00:23:42,729 --> 00:23:45,764
You cannot go around suggesting
outrageous procedures!

570
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,766
I was giving my patient her options.

571
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,868
The patient you only have
because I gave you the chance

572
00:23:49,903 --> 00:23:51,437
in the clinic in the first place!

573
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:52,791
I'm sorry!

574
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:54,740
But I wasn't wrong.

575
00:23:54,774 --> 00:23:56,241
I didn't promise the impossible.

576
00:23:56,276 --> 00:23:58,243
Yeah, I overstepped,
and I'm overstepping again

577
00:23:58,278 --> 00:24:00,245
and pissing you off, and I don't care.

578
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,714
Go on, get mad at me, but don't
take it out on the patient.

579
00:24:02,749 --> 00:24:04,416
Just give her a freaking chance.

580
00:24:09,222 --> 00:24:12,291
When I tell you to know your place,

581
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:14,593
know your damn place.

582
00:24:21,468 --> 00:24:23,969
- Push 25 of mannitol.
- This happened so quickly.

583
00:24:24,003 --> 00:24:25,871
Spontaneous hemorrhage,
but we are gonna get him back.

584
00:24:25,905 --> 00:24:27,306
We have to get him back.

585
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,308
V-fib. Charge paddles to 120.

586
00:24:30,944 --> 00:24:32,711
Clear.

587
00:24:33,913 --> 00:24:35,447
Asystole.

588
00:24:35,482 --> 00:24:37,950
Push another 25 of mannitol.
Check his pupils.

589
00:24:45,158 --> 00:24:46,225
Fixed and dilated.

590
00:24:47,961 --> 00:24:49,695
Let me see that.

591
00:24:53,032 --> 00:24:55,868
No, no. No, no!

592
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:58,504
No!

593
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:00,806
He's gone.
Y-You did everything you could.

594
00:25:09,154 --> 00:25:11,994
Seem to have poor back-bleeding
from the inferior mesenteric.

595
00:25:12,041 --> 00:25:13,274
Murphy, what do you do about that?

596
00:25:13,309 --> 00:25:15,710
Create a circular button around
the artery's origin, harvest it,

597
00:25:15,745 --> 00:25:17,645
- and then reimplant it in the graft.
- How?

598
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,415
Use a partially occluding clamp
on the graft to make a cuff

599
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,239
incision and over-sew
the inferior mesenteric artery

600
00:25:23,264 --> 00:25:25,099
- with running 4-0 prolene.
- And then what?

601
00:25:25,133 --> 00:25:26,834
After the completion of anastomosis,

602
00:25:26,868 --> 00:25:29,236
we check the Doppler signals
on the sigmoid mesentery.

603
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,171
- Hm.
- Exactly.

604
00:25:31,206 --> 00:25:33,173
You've double-checked
every suture I've made,

605
00:25:33,208 --> 00:25:35,909
and you're pimping me
with complicated questions.

606
00:25:35,944 --> 00:25:37,544
They told you my story.

607
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:39,213
What? No.

608
00:25:39,247 --> 00:25:40,848
What story? Is there a story?

609
00:25:40,882 --> 00:25:42,883
W-Who cares?

610
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:45,678
What they didn't tell you,
what they couldn't have told you

611
00:25:46,445 --> 00:25:48,522
is that when I left here,
things really sucked.

612
00:25:48,556 --> 00:25:50,224
Then I got into the program at Foster,

613
00:25:50,258 --> 00:25:51,792
and I worked harder
than I've ever worked,

614
00:25:51,826 --> 00:25:53,127
and I became the best.

615
00:25:53,161 --> 00:25:55,996
And then, Dr. Pierce, <i>you</i> happened.

616
00:25:57,614 --> 00:25:59,133
I'm sorry?

617
00:25:59,167 --> 00:26:01,101
During a cardio rotation,
I found the article

618
00:26:01,136 --> 00:26:03,804
you wrote about awake VATS,
and I was riveted.

619
00:26:03,838 --> 00:26:06,306
So I researched other things
you had written,

620
00:26:06,341 --> 00:26:10,110
and it became very clear to me
that I'm not just a surgeon.

621
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:12,413
I'm a cardiothoracic surgeon,

622
00:26:12,998 --> 00:26:16,216
and I had to find you
and learn from you.

623
00:26:16,251 --> 00:26:17,751
And then I found out
that you'd been hired here,

624
00:26:17,786 --> 00:26:18,952
and I thought, "Well, crap."

625
00:26:18,987 --> 00:26:20,421
And then I realized, well, crap,

626
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:23,624
I have to figure out a way
to get back here somehow.

627
00:26:23,658 --> 00:26:28,695
And now I'm in an O.R.
with <i>the</i> Maggie Pierce.

628
00:26:29,764 --> 00:26:31,331
Sorry, Dr. Riggs, no offense.

629
00:26:31,366 --> 00:26:33,300
No, none taken. I get it.

630
00:26:33,334 --> 00:26:36,170
I just hope that whatever you heard...

631
00:26:37,323 --> 00:26:39,206
well, I can't control that.

632
00:26:41,102 --> 00:26:42,409
You know, when I first got here,

633
00:26:42,444 --> 00:26:44,912
I was so miserable,
I tried to quit after two weeks.

634
00:26:44,946 --> 00:26:48,015
People hated me so much,
I got punched in the face.

635
00:26:48,049 --> 00:26:49,450
Had exactly one friend.

636
00:26:49,484 --> 00:26:51,885
Kepner. She likes everybody.

637
00:26:59,194 --> 00:27:01,795
Um, should we wait
for Jeremy to get back?

638
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:04,164
Uh, no, his stomach goes bonkers
when he's stressed out,

639
00:27:04,199 --> 00:27:05,966
so he might be a while.

640
00:27:07,047 --> 00:27:11,438
Uh, I wanted to talk to you
about scheduling the D&E.

641
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,768
Dr. Karev said there was a surgery.

642
00:27:13,802 --> 00:27:15,175
Why aren't we doing <i>that</i> surgery?

643
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:19,446
Because it's very risky to you,
to the baby.

644
00:27:19,481 --> 00:27:21,215
I already have an expiration date.

645
00:27:21,249 --> 00:27:23,617
Aren't we past a little
worried about some risks?

646
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,553
If we did this,

647
00:27:26,588 --> 00:27:31,725
if we could remove the tumor
and keep your pregnancy intact,

648
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:33,660
by the time you deliver,

649
00:27:33,695 --> 00:27:37,364
the cancer will have still grown
unchecked for six months.

650
00:27:37,398 --> 00:27:40,133
It'd be too far along by then
for us to treat it.

651
00:27:40,168 --> 00:27:41,535
I mean, you would literally

652
00:27:41,569 --> 00:27:45,939
be sacrificing your own life
for your child's.

653
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,543
I can see it, you know?

654
00:27:50,273 --> 00:27:51,345
See what?

655
00:27:51,979 --> 00:27:54,414
Jeremy pushing our kid in the swing,

656
00:27:54,699 --> 00:27:56,683
touching his toes
when they're in the sky.

657
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:58,719
And the baby thinks it's so funny.

658
00:27:58,753 --> 00:28:01,082
I can see them growing older together,

659
00:28:01,962 --> 00:28:03,481
getting to the good stuff.

660
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:06,593
Jeremy showing him "Star Wars"
for the first time.

661
00:28:06,628 --> 00:28:09,363
"Episode IV," 'cause you
can't start anywhere else.

662
00:28:10,932 --> 00:28:13,367
High school, college...

663
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:15,091
his first apartment.

664
00:28:16,237 --> 00:28:19,706
Jeremy's there, and he's the best dad.

665
00:28:20,057 --> 00:28:24,244
I picture that, and all
this crap is for something.

666
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:25,833
A happy ending.

667
00:28:27,482 --> 00:28:30,250
I die, but there's something good still.

668
00:28:30,285 --> 00:28:32,019
There's something good to see.

669
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:36,623
I picture it your way,
and everything goes black.

670
00:28:36,842 --> 00:28:37,931
There's nothing.

671
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,494
Only death.

672
00:28:42,497 --> 00:28:46,810
If this is the only chance
that my baby has to survive,

673
00:28:47,435 --> 00:28:49,714
I am not looking for a guarantee.

674
00:28:50,238 --> 00:28:51,872
I'm looking for a chance.

675
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,915
Where'd you take Veronica?

676
00:29:02,414 --> 00:29:03,550
She's in pre-op.

677
00:29:03,585 --> 00:29:07,421
I was explaining to Jeremy what
to expect after her Whipple.

678
00:29:09,424 --> 00:29:12,559
Thank you, Dr. Bailey, for everything.

679
00:29:17,832 --> 00:29:20,233
Have you seen, um, a hoodie?

680
00:29:20,268 --> 00:29:23,337
Veronica's hoodie. It's black.

681
00:29:23,371 --> 00:29:24,538
Had a hood.

682
00:29:24,572 --> 00:29:29,076
I was looking for it and, um,
Dr. Bailey came up and...

683
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:31,311
- You sure she left it here?
- No, I'm not.

684
00:29:31,346 --> 00:29:33,413
I'm not sure at all because
I wasn't paying any attention.

685
00:29:33,448 --> 00:29:35,816
So who knows? Who the hell
even knows where it is?!

686
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,655
Oh, I can't... I can't do this.

687
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,749
I can't raise a kid.

688
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,159
Not by myself, not without her.

689
00:29:46,194 --> 00:29:47,961
This was a good idea because <i>we</i> had it,

690
00:29:47,996 --> 00:29:49,262
because <i>we</i> were gonna do it.

691
00:29:49,297 --> 00:29:51,665
She's the one that thinks of
things, who keeps track of things.

692
00:29:51,699 --> 00:29:53,367
I'm in charge of fun ideas.

693
00:29:53,401 --> 00:29:55,435
She's in charge of, like, common sense

694
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,371
and where the freaking hoodie is!

695
00:29:58,401 --> 00:30:01,475
The next hoodie I lose,
my kid might be wearing it.

696
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:03,477
What if my kid is wearing the hoodie?

697
00:30:03,511 --> 00:30:07,280
Well, I've worked with a lot
of parents, a lot.

698
00:30:07,315 --> 00:30:08,448
There's only one trick.

699
00:30:08,899 --> 00:30:09,883
What's the trick?

700
00:30:09,917 --> 00:30:14,187
Show up. That's it. Be there. Be around.

701
00:30:14,222 --> 00:30:16,623
It's what you're doing for
your kid and his mom <i>now,</i>

702
00:30:16,852 --> 00:30:18,484
and you're already good at it.

703
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,560
Give yourself a break.

704
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,798
She's my best friend.

705
00:30:28,736 --> 00:30:30,853
She's always been there.

706
00:30:32,774 --> 00:30:34,207
Always.

707
00:30:40,548 --> 00:30:42,816
You ready, Veronica?

708
00:30:44,852 --> 00:30:47,654
Is Dr. Karev gonna be
in the surgery, too?

709
00:30:47,689 --> 00:30:51,324
Uh, he's needed in the clinic.

710
00:30:52,727 --> 00:30:55,529
Then will you tell him
"thank you" for me?

711
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:02,936
The accident caused damage
to a weak spot in his brain.

712
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,671
We tried to repair it,

713
00:31:04,706 --> 00:31:06,540
but Robbie went into
cardiac arrest on the table.

714
00:31:06,574 --> 00:31:08,108
No.

715
00:31:08,142 --> 00:31:09,409
I'm so sorry.

716
00:31:09,444 --> 00:31:11,545
We did everything we could.

717
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:13,293
Mrs. Reeves.

718
00:31:14,708 --> 00:31:15,969
Laura.

719
00:31:19,065 --> 00:31:20,754
If there's anything that we can do...

720
00:31:23,725 --> 00:31:25,525
I wish it was you.

721
00:31:27,495 --> 00:31:29,463
It should've been you.

722
00:31:29,497 --> 00:31:32,566
It should have been you!

723
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,067
Should've been you!

724
00:31:35,636 --> 00:31:36,403
Mrs. Reeves.

725
00:31:36,437 --> 00:31:39,272
Mrs. Reeves, come with me, please.

726
00:31:47,348 --> 00:31:49,316
You want to talk about it?

727
00:31:51,652 --> 00:31:53,553
I'm just waiting to hear
how surgery goes,

728
00:31:53,588 --> 00:31:54,955
so I got some time to kill.

729
00:31:57,718 --> 00:32:00,527
Or not. I'm cool either way.

730
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:05,365
Or maybe just sit.
Uh, Sometimes sitting helps.

731
00:32:08,703 --> 00:32:09,736
I'll just go.

732
00:32:15,042 --> 00:32:16,376
I had a baby.

733
00:32:18,012 --> 00:32:19,260
A baby boy.

734
00:32:20,681 --> 00:32:21,948
I had a son.

735
00:32:21,983 --> 00:32:23,228
Had?

736
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,318
When I was living in L.A.,

737
00:32:25,353 --> 00:32:30,179
um, he was born with anencephaly but...

738
00:32:30,658 --> 00:32:31,792
without a brain.

739
00:32:31,826 --> 00:32:34,947
So he lived for, um...

740
00:32:37,675 --> 00:32:39,232
43 minutes.

741
00:32:43,644 --> 00:32:44,844
And I held him.

742
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:49,016
I got to hold him.

743
00:32:53,915 --> 00:32:55,615
And then it was time.

744
00:32:56,437 --> 00:32:58,351
And he was...

745
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:02,756
He donated all of his organs.

746
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,962
And then I let him go.

747
00:33:11,194 --> 00:33:13,700
And it almost killed me.

748
00:33:15,069 --> 00:33:16,369
I didn't know.

749
00:33:18,498 --> 00:33:20,132
No, you wouldn't. Um...

750
00:33:21,742 --> 00:33:26,179
I never told my family.
Not... Derek, not Meredith.

751
00:33:26,214 --> 00:33:27,690
No one.

752
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,056
I haven't told Owen all of it.

753
00:33:36,464 --> 00:33:37,958
And I don't think I can.

754
00:33:40,228 --> 00:33:42,796
He wants a family so bad.

755
00:33:45,733 --> 00:33:47,567
How do I tell him that...

756
00:33:51,138 --> 00:33:53,173
He won't look at me the same way.

757
00:33:53,544 --> 00:33:54,908
Are you kidding?

758
00:33:57,545 --> 00:33:59,258
He's gonna hate me.

759
00:33:59,714 --> 00:34:02,549
I don't think so. It's Hunt.

760
00:34:07,788 --> 00:34:09,723
I took a pregnancy test last night.

761
00:34:09,757 --> 00:34:13,760
I, um... I thought I might...

762
00:34:16,998 --> 00:34:19,532
And, uh, as I sat there
waiting for the result,

763
00:34:19,567 --> 00:34:21,875
I just watched him get
more and more excited.

764
00:34:22,904 --> 00:34:25,438
He wanted it so badly.

765
00:34:28,776 --> 00:34:31,430
And the longer I sat there,
the more I felt like...

766
00:34:32,947 --> 00:34:34,622
I was dying.

767
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:38,542
I couldn't breathe, I couldn't move.

768
00:34:41,856 --> 00:34:43,786
And when that stick was negative,

769
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:46,259
Owen's heart broke.

770
00:34:49,215 --> 00:34:50,319
And...

771
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,735
I was so relieved.

772
00:34:57,638 --> 00:34:59,005
I could breathe again.

773
00:35:08,221 --> 00:35:09,162
See.

774
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:14,854
Now look me in the eye and
tell me that he won't hate me.

775
00:35:22,644 --> 00:35:24,379
Thank you.

776
00:35:27,435 --> 00:35:31,533
Hey! I'm sorry. I'm sorry
if I was weird earlier.

777
00:35:31,568 --> 00:35:34,295
I was just... I didn't know you were
coming back, so I was a little thrown.

778
00:35:34,406 --> 00:35:36,573
Yeah. Yeah. I've been thrown all day.

779
00:35:36,608 --> 00:35:39,877
Yeah. But it is good to see you.

780
00:35:40,709 --> 00:35:42,514
I saw that you went into fetal medicine.

781
00:35:42,547 --> 00:35:43,881
That's very impressive.

782
00:35:43,915 --> 00:35:45,916
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

783
00:35:46,839 --> 00:35:48,919
I'm gonna get these labs to Dr. Riggs.

784
00:35:48,953 --> 00:35:49,887
I will see you around.

785
00:35:49,921 --> 00:35:50,789
Bye.

786
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:57,027
You okay?

787
00:35:58,263 --> 00:36:00,230
I can't stop thinking about it.

788
00:36:00,265 --> 00:36:02,433
I watched Robbie stand there
and talk to his dad.

789
00:36:02,467 --> 00:36:04,168
I mean, he was fine.

790
00:36:04,202 --> 00:36:05,354
Then he wasn't.

791
00:36:11,012 --> 00:36:12,544
Hi, baby.

792
00:36:22,932 --> 00:36:25,433
Just... April, it's secure, I'm sure.

793
00:36:25,468 --> 00:36:27,235
I know, I know.

794
00:36:33,209 --> 00:36:34,609
I just wanted to double-check.

795
00:36:34,644 --> 00:36:35,870
Yeah.

796
00:36:36,946 --> 00:36:39,147
One second.

797
00:36:44,887 --> 00:36:46,254
Yep. Looks okay.

798
00:36:51,561 --> 00:36:52,661
DeLuca!

799
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:57,699
Hey, um, did you hear from
your lawyer about a trial date?

800
00:36:57,733 --> 00:36:59,668
Yeah, it's, uh, it's coming up soon.

801
00:36:59,702 --> 00:37:00,936
Oh. Good night.

802
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:02,804
Wait. Wait. What's up?

803
00:37:03,973 --> 00:37:05,040
Nothing.

804
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,775
Try again. What's up?

805
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:08,710
We shouldn't talk
about the case anymore.

806
00:37:08,744 --> 00:37:09,611
Wait. What?

807
00:37:14,383 --> 00:37:17,253
I know you're talking
with Karev. I saw you.

808
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,472
And after all that stuff you said

809
00:37:18,514 --> 00:37:19,888
about how you guys never talk anymore?

810
00:37:19,922 --> 00:37:21,690
We were working on a case in the clinic.

811
00:37:21,724 --> 00:37:23,358
I didn't exactly have a choice.

812
00:37:24,327 --> 00:37:27,128
What? You think I'm some sort of
double agent, and I'm...?

813
00:37:27,163 --> 00:37:29,237
No. No, I don't think...

814
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:33,702
You just... You pick the bad guy.

815
00:37:33,736 --> 00:37:36,404
So, the guy who hurts you
or who hurts other people,

816
00:37:36,439 --> 00:37:38,974
and you deserve better.

817
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:42,978
Maybe you can't see that, but I do.

818
00:37:43,012 --> 00:37:45,113
So, when I see you with him, I just...

819
00:37:47,116 --> 00:37:50,518
Whatever. I, uh, I gotta go.

820
00:37:58,361 --> 00:38:00,328
Hey, I'm about to head out.
You gonna be long?

821
00:38:00,363 --> 00:38:01,935
I thought maybe I'd throw something
on the grill, and...

822
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,831
Oh, yeah, uh, no.

823
00:38:02,865 --> 00:38:05,233
I have a cervical spine
dislocation that just came up.

824
00:38:05,268 --> 00:38:07,202
I, uh, will be awhile.

825
00:38:07,236 --> 00:38:09,371
Oh, uh, well, you know,
I'm not hungry. I can wait.

826
00:38:09,405 --> 00:38:10,872
You shouldn't.

827
00:38:10,907 --> 00:38:15,310
Um, I'll be pretty late,
so don't wait up, 'kay?

828
00:38:24,053 --> 00:38:25,954
Um, I'm sorry.

829
00:38:25,988 --> 00:38:27,289
They were supposed to
tell you not to wait.

830
00:38:27,323 --> 00:38:28,423
I had a Whipple.

831
00:38:28,457 --> 00:38:30,926
I know. I waited anyway.

832
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,428
We need to talk.

833
00:38:33,462 --> 00:38:36,898
You're right. We do.

834
00:38:38,067 --> 00:38:40,302
Because I'm not firing Alex Karev.

835
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:42,404
You think this is lenient.

836
00:38:42,438 --> 00:38:45,540
You think this is about
my personal feelings.

837
00:38:45,574 --> 00:38:46,775
Y-You're right.

838
00:38:47,149 --> 00:38:48,811
You don't train a surgeon

839
00:38:48,844 --> 00:38:50,478
without becoming personally involved.

840
00:38:50,513 --> 00:38:52,247
A-At least, I hope not!

841
00:38:52,281 --> 00:38:55,483
Now, I've made mistakes,
and those who trained me

842
00:38:55,518 --> 00:38:58,153
afforded me the opportunity to grow,

843
00:38:58,187 --> 00:39:00,288
and I'm damn sure
continuing that tradition

844
00:39:00,323 --> 00:39:02,290
with a surgeon as good as Karev!

845
00:39:02,325 --> 00:39:05,293
So Alex Karev stays right where he is!

846
00:39:05,328 --> 00:39:07,996
<i>When someone you love
is in physical danger,</i>

847
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:11,599
<i>finding the strength you need
to save them is easy.</i>

848
00:39:11,634 --> 00:39:12,767
That's fine.

849
00:39:13,669 --> 00:39:14,903
I'm sorry?

850
00:39:15,459 --> 00:39:17,806
It's fine. Karev can stay where he is.

851
00:39:18,027 --> 00:39:20,443
We have a much bigger problem
than Karev.

852
00:39:20,476 --> 00:39:24,012
After this morning, I started
looking into Alex's record,

853
00:39:24,046 --> 00:39:26,948
and Ben Warren's, and this Leah Murphy,

854
00:39:26,983 --> 00:39:29,317
and all these people
who got second chances.

855
00:39:29,352 --> 00:39:31,786
April Kepner, Meredith Grey.

856
00:39:31,821 --> 00:39:34,789
And I wondered,
why did they need chances?

857
00:39:34,824 --> 00:39:36,791
Why did they screw up
in the first place?

858
00:39:36,826 --> 00:39:38,860
I'm sorry. I don't see what you're...

859
00:39:38,894 --> 00:39:40,929
We used to be the leading
education program

860
00:39:40,963 --> 00:39:42,497
on the whole West Coast.

861
00:39:42,531 --> 00:39:44,499
So why would a Leah Murphy fail here

862
00:39:44,533 --> 00:39:46,468
only to thrive somewhere else?

863
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:49,471
It's how we're teaching.

864
00:39:49,505 --> 00:39:51,439
There is a fundamental flaw

865
00:39:51,474 --> 00:39:54,376
in how we are teaching our residents.

866
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:56,344
And we have got to fix this.

867
00:39:56,379 --> 00:39:57,479
You and me.

868
00:39:57,513 --> 00:39:58,613
And Dr. Webber.

869
00:39:58,647 --> 00:40:01,616
The residency program
is your husband's department.

870
00:40:03,085 --> 00:40:06,454
I know. I know it is.

871
00:40:06,489 --> 00:40:09,057
<i>But sometimes the threat isn't physical.</i>

872
00:40:09,091 --> 00:40:11,593
<i>Sometimes it goes deeper.</i>

873
00:40:14,321 --> 00:40:18,367
<i>In which case,
no instincts can save you.</i>

874
00:40:18,401 --> 00:40:22,337
<i>No superhuman strength.
No adrenaline rush.</i>

875
00:40:29,378 --> 00:40:31,212
You didn't call, you didn't text,

876
00:40:31,247 --> 00:40:33,381
you definitely didn't come home early.

877
00:40:33,416 --> 00:40:35,517
I had to check on a patient.

878
00:40:35,551 --> 00:40:36,384
How did that go?

879
00:40:36,419 --> 00:40:39,487
Fine. She's still gonna die, though.

880
00:40:39,522 --> 00:40:41,656
How did court go?

881
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:43,825
Fine. Not a big deal.

882
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:47,662
<i>You can't power your way out
from under the crashing car.</i>

883
00:40:49,598 --> 00:40:51,433
I want waffle Sundays.

884
00:40:52,701 --> 00:40:54,436
Am I supposed to know what that means?

885
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:57,705
Well, every Sunday,
I want to do waffles,

886
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,874
like a family, all of us...

887
00:40:59,909 --> 00:41:04,712
you, me, the kids, Pierce,
everybody, all together.

888
00:41:04,747 --> 00:41:06,247
Okay.

889
00:41:06,282 --> 00:41:08,083
I want to do that as long as we can

890
00:41:08,729 --> 00:41:10,753
before, you know, I go away.

891
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:13,889
It's important to me.

892
00:41:16,492 --> 00:41:17,559
Okay.

893
00:41:17,593 --> 00:41:19,961
And Amelia. She should come, too.

894
00:41:23,466 --> 00:41:24,966
You need to be nicer to her.

895
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,601
You need your sisters.

896
00:41:26,635 --> 00:41:28,937
I'm not gonna always be around.
You're gonna need them.

897
00:41:29,513 --> 00:41:31,739
<i>All you can do is sit...</i>

898
00:41:31,774 --> 00:41:35,110
She talks so much.

899
00:41:35,144 --> 00:41:37,512
So let her. Okay?

900
00:41:39,754 --> 00:41:40,888
Okay?

901
00:41:40,927 --> 00:41:42,270
Okay.

902
00:41:43,564 --> 00:41:44,553
<i>...and wait...</i>

903
00:41:57,533 --> 00:41:59,601
Do I have to help make the waffles?

904
00:41:59,635 --> 00:42:01,603
That's <i>my</i> thing.
Stay out of the kitchen.

905
00:42:02,402 --> 00:42:03,905
<i>...and wish things were different.</i>
