1
00:00:04,769 --> 00:00:07,904
I don't like questions without any answers,

2
00:00:07,938 --> 00:00:10,328
like "where do we go when we die?"

3
00:00:10,353 --> 00:00:13,002
I mean, I know what happens
physiologically speaking,

4
00:00:13,027 --> 00:00:15,488
but beyond that, what really happens?

5
00:00:16,294 --> 00:00:17,420
Anything?

6
00:00:17,445 --> 00:00:19,065
That's what you start asking yourself

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:20,742
when you live on a clock.

8
00:00:20,819 --> 00:00:23,465
All these questions without any answers...

9
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,625
they'll drive you nuts.

10
00:00:26,468 --> 00:00:28,193
That's why I like what I do...

11
00:00:28,218 --> 00:00:30,361
fixing babies, birthing babies.

12
00:00:30,386 --> 00:00:32,720
No ambiguity there, no questions,

13
00:00:32,745 --> 00:00:36,039
just answers... clear,
precise, obvious answers.

14
00:00:36,064 --> 00:00:38,856
And life... beautiful new life.

15
00:00:38,881 --> 00:00:39,948
Hope for the future.

16
00:00:39,982 --> 00:00:41,683
God, I miss that.

17
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,807
Morning!

18
00:00:43,832 --> 00:00:47,001
Robbins, are you ever not chirpy?

19
00:00:47,026 --> 00:00:48,202
Does that ever happen?

20
00:00:48,227 --> 00:00:50,328
Are you ever not snarky?

21
00:00:50,353 --> 00:00:51,488
Also, you snore.

22
00:00:51,513 --> 00:00:53,881
I can't crash here again
tonight without earplugs.

23
00:00:53,906 --> 00:00:56,246
Okay, so, we have seven cases today.

24
00:00:56,271 --> 00:00:57,859
The first one is in two hours.

25
00:00:57,884 --> 00:01:00,077
Also, it's Friday, so that's MRI day.

26
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:01,102
You know the drill.

27
00:01:01,136 --> 00:01:04,324
47 minutes of my very
limited life-span wasted.

28
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:06,145
Mm, come on, come on.

29
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,491
God! I'm coming.

30
00:01:07,516 --> 00:01:09,470
- Stop chirping.
- Stop snarking.

31
00:01:09,495 --> 00:01:13,029
Whew! After this, we've got the
diaphragmatic hernia. Baby's 27 weeks.

32
00:01:13,054 --> 00:01:14,875
We'll do a, um, tracheal
balloon occlusion...

33
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,736
hey. Figured you could use this...

34
00:01:16,761 --> 00:01:18,528
Which should, if we're
lucky, ensure the blood...

35
00:01:18,553 --> 00:01:20,682
- before the big lecture.
- Oh, um, thanks.

36
00:01:20,707 --> 00:01:22,274
Thank you.

37
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:24,798
Um, they already scheduled

38
00:01:24,823 --> 00:01:27,291
a follow-up procedure on the baby, as well.

39
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:30,474
You're cultivating quite
a bit of buzz, you know?

40
00:01:30,499 --> 00:01:31,572
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

41
00:01:31,597 --> 00:01:34,921
I heard from two hospitals
wanting us to record your talk.

42
00:01:36,534 --> 00:01:38,899
But we won't be too close to the due date.

43
00:01:38,924 --> 00:01:41,385
- And if...
- I have a lot on my plate right now,

44
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:44,244
just with, uh, Herman and her tumor.

45
00:01:44,269 --> 00:01:46,224
Uh, her surgery.

46
00:01:46,249 --> 00:01:48,593
I really need to focus...

47
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:50,052
On the tumor.

48
00:01:50,852 --> 00:01:53,707
Don't need any distractions, and you're...

49
00:01:53,844 --> 00:01:55,566
Very hard to ignore.

50
00:01:55,591 --> 00:01:57,225
Hey, I ju... It was just coffee.

51
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,984
No, I so appreciate the coffee.

52
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:01,511
Uh, I was just getting some
coffee for myself, and...

53
00:02:01,536 --> 00:02:02,770
It's good coffee. It...

54
00:02:02,795 --> 00:02:04,362
It's great coffee.

55
00:02:04,387 --> 00:02:05,657
I, uh... I can...

56
00:02:05,682 --> 00:02:07,513
I can just get my own if... if you...

57
00:02:07,538 --> 00:02:10,239
I mean, you can get your own so easily.

58
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:12,065
I don't want to get my own coffee. I...

59
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,392
I mean I do. I can. I will.

60
00:02:15,417 --> 00:02:18,046
I... I can get my own coffee
all day long. I just...

61
00:02:18,244 --> 00:02:20,078
Owen.

62
00:02:20,419 --> 00:02:23,255
Thank you for bringing me the coffee.

63
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:25,809
I really like it.

64
00:02:28,108 --> 00:02:29,208
Uh, you're welcome.

65
00:02:29,242 --> 00:02:32,011
So, how's my head?

66
00:02:32,045 --> 00:02:34,179
The tumor seems stable.

67
00:02:34,204 --> 00:02:36,299
I was worried about
the inferomedial margin,

68
00:02:36,316 --> 00:02:38,423
but the good news is,
there's no sign of growth.

69
00:02:38,448 --> 00:02:40,416
It hasn't invaded the optic nerve yet.

70
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:41,942
Well, how long till it does?

71
00:02:41,967 --> 00:02:44,269
I need a number, Shepherd.
I have things to plan.

72
00:02:44,294 --> 00:02:46,435
About six weeks... Maybe eight

73
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,356
if you go in for the localized radiation
treatments I've prescribed for you.

74
00:02:49,381 --> 00:02:51,530
- I'd like for those to start today.
- No, no, no, no.

75
00:02:51,565 --> 00:02:53,065
I tried that. Hated it.

76
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:55,201
Doctor's orders. It is our best chance

77
00:02:55,235 --> 00:02:57,293
to shrink the part of the
tumor on your optic chiasm.

78
00:02:57,318 --> 00:02:58,718
- Oh, crap.
- Glenda Castillo!

79
00:02:58,743 --> 00:03:00,184
We're headed to surgery, Dr. Bailey.

80
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:01,342
No time to talk.

81
00:03:01,367 --> 00:03:02,734
But you haven't given me an answer.

82
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:03,919
Actually, I have. It was no.

83
00:03:03,944 --> 00:03:05,277
But you haven't given me the right answer.

84
00:03:05,302 --> 00:03:06,569
You could at least meet with her.

85
00:03:06,594 --> 00:03:07,761
I've seen the case, okay?

86
00:03:07,814 --> 00:03:10,874
I'm sorry, but I'm working
on a very limited time frame

87
00:03:10,917 --> 00:03:13,722
with a very specific list of
surgeries to teach Robbins,

88
00:03:13,747 --> 00:03:15,515
and Glenda Castillo isn't one of them.

89
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,266
Okay, well, as a personal
favor to me, just me per...

90
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:19,973
I have no time to make it personal.

91
00:03:19,998 --> 00:03:21,636
It's a no. I'm sorry.

92
00:03:21,661 --> 00:03:23,328
I'll get you some names... good people.

93
00:03:23,353 --> 00:03:24,619
She can see one of them.

94
00:03:26,118 --> 00:03:28,019
Um, sorry.

95
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,562
Three down, all these to go.

96
00:03:46,587 --> 00:03:48,697
We've got four months'
worth of surgeries up here.

97
00:03:48,722 --> 00:03:51,717
I mean, how are we gonna get four
months of surgeries done in eight weeks?

98
00:03:51,742 --> 00:03:53,346
We just do, I suppose.

99
00:03:53,371 --> 00:03:55,504
You'll do the next one
yourself. I'll watch.

100
00:03:55,529 --> 00:03:57,499
What? No. No, thank you.

101
00:03:57,524 --> 00:03:58,651
I appreciate the vote of confidence,

102
00:03:58,698 --> 00:04:00,299
but I'm not even actually
sure that I know how...

103
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:01,992
I need to see what you've learned,

104
00:04:02,017 --> 00:04:03,865
what you can and can't do on your own

105
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,736
while I'm still around to
fix it when you screw up.

106
00:04:06,761 --> 00:04:07,877
Gee, thanks.

107
00:04:07,902 --> 00:04:09,904
It's not a vote of
confidence. It's a necessity.

108
00:04:09,929 --> 00:04:11,463
Training wheels are off, Robbins.

109
00:04:11,488 --> 00:04:12,555
Time is up. What's next?

110
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,147
Uh, your radiation treatment.

111
00:04:14,172 --> 00:04:16,666
Ugh. Radiation hasn't worked yet.

112
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:19,451
I don't see why it's suddenly
supposed to start working.

113
00:04:19,486 --> 00:04:22,120
- Radiation is bull...
- Shepherd says that it's necessary.

114
00:04:22,145 --> 00:04:23,690
She's the doctor here.

115
00:04:30,367 --> 00:04:32,149
"Life will out."

116
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:36,494
The origins and lessons
of life and evolution

117
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:37,686
are long and complex,

118
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,731
but what they basically boil
down to is, life will out.

119
00:04:42,087 --> 00:04:45,489
Life will always find a way to continue.

120
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:46,761
Always.

121
00:04:46,796 --> 00:04:49,798
Life... will... out.

122
00:04:51,178 --> 00:04:54,847
This is a massive grade IV astrocytoma.

123
00:04:54,872 --> 00:04:56,470
I want you to take a look at it.

124
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:58,286
Really look.

125
00:04:58,986 --> 00:05:00,787
Look at its size.

126
00:05:00,812 --> 00:05:03,380
Look at the way it invades healthy tissue.

127
00:05:03,431 --> 00:05:05,532
Look at its vasculature.

128
00:05:05,557 --> 00:05:09,721
It is blood and tissue and flesh.

129
00:05:10,368 --> 00:05:11,737
It's growing...

130
00:05:11,762 --> 00:05:13,796
Adapting to its environment,

131
00:05:13,821 --> 00:05:16,577
struggling to survive, to stay alive.

132
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:18,451
It is alive.

133
00:05:18,476 --> 00:05:20,258
We don't like to think of it that way, but

134
00:05:20,381 --> 00:05:23,549
it's nested in the womb of a human brain,

135
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:27,543
feeding on its host, growing
and fighting for life...

136
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,027
almost like a fetus.

137
00:05:29,052 --> 00:05:30,190
No, scratch that.

138
00:05:30,215 --> 00:05:32,216
Let's just for science and giggles

139
00:05:32,241 --> 00:05:33,717
say exactly like a fetus.

140
00:05:33,742 --> 00:05:37,081
Because like a healthy
fetus, it is thriving.

141
00:05:37,106 --> 00:05:39,487
You know, there are
even some types of tumors

142
00:05:39,512 --> 00:05:41,847
that grow teeth, hair...

143
00:05:41,872 --> 00:05:44,374
A stray eye.

144
00:05:46,155 --> 00:05:47,722
Have I repulsed you?

145
00:05:47,757 --> 00:05:49,891
- It's gross, right?
- Yeah.

146
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,450
I mean, that is a problem.

147
00:05:52,495 --> 00:05:55,230
Nobody wants something
that nasty in their head.

148
00:05:55,975 --> 00:05:59,668
I'd like you for one
moment to consider the idea

149
00:05:59,702 --> 00:06:03,114
that, to the tumor, we are the problem,

150
00:06:03,972 --> 00:06:05,485
we are the invader.

151
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,911
We are the danger.

152
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:09,816
To the tumor, we are the cancer.

153
00:06:10,212 --> 00:06:11,517
And the tumor?

154
00:06:12,193 --> 00:06:16,027
Well, the tumor sees itself as
a sweet, cute, fat-cheeked baby

155
00:06:16,052 --> 00:06:17,851
just trying to make its way into the world,

156
00:06:17,876 --> 00:06:20,678
and we want to stop it, destroy it,

157
00:06:20,703 --> 00:06:24,606
tear it from its happy
little home like barbarians.

158
00:06:24,961 --> 00:06:26,314
To the tumor,

159
00:06:26,424 --> 00:06:29,326
we are the soulless, murderous monsters.

160
00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:31,404
Why do I do this?

161
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:34,588
Why do I call it "baby"
and talk about killing it?

162
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:38,501
Because this kind of
tumor deserves respect.

163
00:06:39,796 --> 00:06:41,697
It deserves a little humanity.

164
00:06:42,044 --> 00:06:43,788
Charming, isn't it?

165
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,857
They put clouds on the
ceiling to distract you.

166
00:06:46,882 --> 00:06:49,784
Least they could do is put
something interesting up there,

167
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:52,021
like porn.

168
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:55,961
It's not just a tumor.

169
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:58,384
It's ingenuity.

170
00:06:58,409 --> 00:06:59,509
It's strength.

171
00:06:59,534 --> 00:07:01,302
It's adaptability.

172
00:07:01,327 --> 00:07:02,546
It's poetry.

173
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,634
It's one of God's masterpieces.

174
00:07:05,755 --> 00:07:08,816
It is alive.

175
00:07:14,738 --> 00:07:15,938
Mm.

176
00:07:27,023 --> 00:07:28,490
You okay?

177
00:07:29,207 --> 00:07:30,552
Sure.

178
00:07:31,193 --> 00:07:33,640
And like any living thing,
it wants to stay alive.

179
00:07:33,665 --> 00:07:35,166
Like any living thing,

180
00:07:35,191 --> 00:07:37,559
it is going to fight like hell to survive.

181
00:07:37,584 --> 00:07:40,753
And when I saw open that skull
and come face-to-face with it,

182
00:07:40,778 --> 00:07:43,579
with that tumor, with that living thing,

183
00:07:43,604 --> 00:07:46,072
it will be almost impossible to remove...

184
00:07:46,097 --> 00:07:47,675
Well, I'll see you after.

185
00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:53,158
Because it would rather
destroy the brain that holds it

186
00:07:53,183 --> 00:07:55,651
than go gently into that good night.

187
00:08:12,968 --> 00:08:14,969
It is alive.

188
00:08:16,588 --> 00:08:18,282
And what's it all come down to?

189
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,533
Life...

190
00:08:21,077 --> 00:08:22,385
Will...

191
00:08:22,584 --> 00:08:24,080
Out.

00:08:25,815 --> 00:08:28,783

194
00:08:37,807 --> 00:08:42,277
So, our fat-cheeked-baby tumor

195
00:08:42,312 --> 00:08:43,879
that's nestled in that brain,

196
00:08:43,913 --> 00:08:45,480
it's a creature of habit.

197
00:08:45,515 --> 00:08:49,059
It has the same routine
day in and day out...

198
00:08:49,084 --> 00:08:52,520
to grow, to spread out, to take up space.

199
00:08:52,545 --> 00:08:54,518
That's it.

200
00:08:55,222 --> 00:09:00,294
At this point, our baby tumor
is so enmeshed, so invasive,

201
00:09:00,651 --> 00:09:03,219
it's touching virtually
every single brain structure.

202
00:09:03,244 --> 00:09:05,359
It's pushed existing tissue aside,

203
00:09:05,384 --> 00:09:08,592
shoved brain matter out of the
way to find room for itself.

204
00:09:09,594 --> 00:09:14,009
How do you remove it without
destroying the brain around it?

205
00:09:14,043 --> 00:09:16,778
How do you kill the baby
without killing the mother?

206
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:22,059
I stare at these scans, and
the tumor stares back at me,

207
00:09:22,267 --> 00:09:24,874
daring me to try to extract it.

208
00:09:25,542 --> 00:09:28,406
I mean, this tumor is bold and brazen.

209
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:29,825
This tumor thinks it's in charge.

210
00:09:29,859 --> 00:09:32,661
This tumor thinks it owns the place.

211
00:09:32,695 --> 00:09:34,451
I don't have to explain myself to you.

212
00:09:34,476 --> 00:09:36,351
You missed your radiation
session this morning.

213
00:09:36,385 --> 00:09:39,098
- I told you, I'm not doing that anymore.
- That is not your call.

214
00:09:39,123 --> 00:09:42,373
My tumor, my head... it
absolutely is my call.

215
00:09:42,398 --> 00:09:44,745
The tumor will be
exponentially easier to remove

216
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,068
after the radiation.

217
00:09:46,093 --> 00:09:47,416
Nicole, please.

218
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,642
Go to radiation!

219
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:51,963
- I will think about it.
- Okay.

220
00:09:51,988 --> 00:09:53,619
The thing about a tumor like this is,

221
00:09:53,644 --> 00:09:55,067
you can't let it intimidate you.

222
00:09:55,271 --> 00:09:57,906
The tumor isn't smarter than you.

223
00:09:58,485 --> 00:10:00,986
You just need a plan of attack.

224
00:10:01,011 --> 00:10:02,553
Here. Feel that?

225
00:10:02,578 --> 00:10:03,869
You must be methodical.

226
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,951
You want to find a spot with
just the right amount of give.

227
00:10:05,976 --> 00:10:07,701
That's where you want to cut. Scalpel.

228
00:10:07,726 --> 00:10:09,560
Point of access is key.

229
00:10:09,585 --> 00:10:11,416
- You're up, Robbins.
- I know.

230
00:10:11,441 --> 00:10:12,763
I've never done that part before.

231
00:10:12,788 --> 00:10:15,727
So, um, you were really serious about that?

232
00:10:15,752 --> 00:10:17,073
It's time. Make the cut.

233
00:10:17,126 --> 00:10:19,406
- But I don't know... I've never...
- Make the cut.

234
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:29,695
And then you start.

235
00:10:31,788 --> 00:10:33,999
That is the most daunting step...

236
00:10:35,059 --> 00:10:38,401
pushing a blade into that
first squishy blob of flesh...

237
00:10:40,337 --> 00:10:42,970
Because the first cut
is what sets the tone.

238
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:48,600
It determines every single
move from that point on.

239
00:10:49,561 --> 00:10:52,130
So, you have to be careful.

240
00:10:52,155 --> 00:10:53,522
You have to be sure.

241
00:10:54,576 --> 00:10:56,999
Or you're in trouble.

242
00:10:59,047 --> 00:11:01,415
It's like a...

243
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,478
- Just look at them.
- Who?

244
00:11:03,503 --> 00:11:05,843
Arizona and Herman... they're
practically joined at the hip.

245
00:11:05,868 --> 00:11:07,102
I'll take one of those, too.

246
00:11:07,127 --> 00:11:08,324
Well, she is Herman's fellow.

247
00:11:08,349 --> 00:11:10,401
Isn't she sort of supposed
to follow Herman around?

248
00:11:10,426 --> 00:11:13,027
They're laughing all the time,

249
00:11:13,062 --> 00:11:14,832
And Arizona seems so...

250
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,058
Happy... like really happy.

251
00:11:17,085 --> 00:11:20,041
- So?
- You seem happy... Ish.

252
00:11:20,066 --> 00:11:22,268
- Why do you even care?
- I don't, obviously.

253
00:11:22,293 --> 00:11:23,964
I'm just making conversation.

254
00:11:26,558 --> 00:11:28,782
Don't you guys think it's weird
how they're always together?

255
00:11:28,807 --> 00:11:30,145
They're not always together.

256
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:31,880
- They do bunk up together sometimes.
- What?

257
00:11:31,914 --> 00:11:33,414
- Alex.
- Robbins has been crashing with Herman.

258
00:11:33,449 --> 00:11:34,883
She hasn't slept at the house all week.

259
00:11:34,917 --> 00:11:35,951
- What?!
- Alex.

260
00:11:35,976 --> 00:11:37,176
- I don't mean like that.
- They're not together

261
00:11:37,201 --> 00:11:38,924
together, and you know that.

262
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:40,049
Mm-hmm.

263
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:42,056
Arizona used to hate her.
Now they're having sleepovers?

264
00:11:42,091 --> 00:11:44,549
Well, it's a good thing, right,
that they're getting along?

265
00:11:44,574 --> 00:11:46,597
Herman's not exactly
the warmest person, so...

266
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:48,681
When you talk to Derek tonight,

267
00:11:48,706 --> 00:11:51,153
would you ask him something for
me without saying it's for me?

268
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,500
I don't know that I w...

269
00:11:52,535 --> 00:11:53,902
Just ask him what he'd use

270
00:11:53,936 --> 00:11:56,371
to avoid disrupting
the gratiolet radiations

271
00:11:56,396 --> 00:11:58,070
off the geniculate body of the thalamus.

272
00:11:58,095 --> 00:11:59,403
- Why don't you ask him that?
- No, no, no.

273
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:00,962
No, no. That's the point. You ask him.

274
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:02,043
I can't ask him for help.

275
00:12:02,068 --> 00:12:04,770
I cannot listen to the
smugness in his voice.

276
00:12:04,943 --> 00:12:05,910
You can hear it.

277
00:12:05,935 --> 00:12:08,149
He has transcontinental
smugness. You know what?

278
00:12:08,174 --> 00:12:10,275
Forget it. I'm fine. I don't need him.

279
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,333
I don't need Derek.

280
00:12:11,358 --> 00:12:12,926
I will figure it out myself.

281
00:12:12,951 --> 00:12:14,585
When did this happen?

282
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:15,677
She found the perfect rebound

283
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:18,504
without having to
actually find a rebound...

284
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,763
I mean, she just gets all
the good times and the fun,

285
00:12:20,788 --> 00:12:22,624
none of the bad times or the mess,

286
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:24,149
no chance of getting hurt.

287
00:12:24,174 --> 00:12:26,304
You don't even have to wax. It's not fair!

288
00:12:27,554 --> 00:12:30,342
Oh, my God. Am I seriously
wishing for a sexless relationship

289
00:12:30,367 --> 00:12:31,734
where I don't have to groom myself?

290
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:33,773
- Is that where I am now?
- It sounds good to me.

291
00:12:33,798 --> 00:12:36,291
- Welcome to my life these days.
- You chicks need to get laid.

292
00:12:36,316 --> 00:12:37,801
That also sounds good to me.

293
00:12:38,035 --> 00:12:39,543
Not without the grooming.

294
00:12:39,568 --> 00:12:41,445
It's in there. He can find it.

295
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,870
What, he can't do a little work first?

296
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:44,283
I like her.

297
00:12:49,485 --> 00:12:50,952
Eddie.

298
00:12:50,987 --> 00:12:53,782
- Excuse me?
- Uh, Glenda Castillo,

299
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:55,875
the patient you and Herman
turned down last week,

300
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:57,777
her husband's name was Eddie.

301
00:12:57,811 --> 00:13:00,179
I lost him six months ago

302
00:13:00,214 --> 00:13:02,994
after he was injured
in a head-on collision.

303
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:04,987
My hands were inside of his body

304
00:13:05,012 --> 00:13:06,646
when his heart stopped beating.

305
00:13:06,671 --> 00:13:08,098
My hands held Glenda's

306
00:13:08,123 --> 00:13:10,539
when I told her Eddie died on my watch.

307
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,864
Three weeks later, she
found out she was pregnant.

308
00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:14,356
She's not insured,

309
00:13:14,381 --> 00:13:16,549
but she remembered me and this hospital,

310
00:13:16,574 --> 00:13:17,806
so, she came here

311
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:19,799
to see if I could give
her some prenatal care,

312
00:13:19,824 --> 00:13:21,531
and guess what we found out.

313
00:13:21,556 --> 00:13:24,258
Her baby has a tumor...

314
00:13:24,283 --> 00:13:28,187
a large, dangerous tumor

315
00:13:28,212 --> 00:13:30,647
that's not just messing
with the baby's system,

316
00:13:30,672 --> 00:13:32,105
it's messing with hers.

317
00:13:32,246 --> 00:13:34,380
I couldn't save her husband's life,

318
00:13:34,405 --> 00:13:36,252
but I can help save her baby.

319
00:13:36,277 --> 00:13:38,245
I owe this woman that much.

320
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,606
Herman has to take her on as a patient.

321
00:13:41,631 --> 00:13:43,332
Just... just have her
meet Glenda, all right?

322
00:13:43,357 --> 00:13:44,724
- Then she'll...
- I can't, I can't!

323
00:13:44,758 --> 00:13:46,770
I can't trick her into seeing a
patient she doesn't want to treat.

324
00:13:46,795 --> 00:13:48,012
Who's in charge of her schedule?

325
00:13:48,037 --> 00:13:49,882
Who tells her where to go and when?

326
00:13:49,907 --> 00:13:53,959
Who tells her what surgery or
post-op or anonymous consult

327
00:13:53,984 --> 00:13:55,919
she should see next?

328
00:13:56,219 --> 00:13:57,253
Uh...

329
00:13:58,497 --> 00:14:00,842
I'm concerned about her blood pressure.

330
00:14:00,867 --> 00:14:03,592
It's increased to 140
systolic in the past week,

331
00:14:03,617 --> 00:14:05,284
and her swelling's gotten worse.

332
00:14:05,309 --> 00:14:06,758
Uh, I used to have ankles.

333
00:14:06,783 --> 00:14:09,055
Now I have balloons with toes.

334
00:14:10,148 --> 00:14:13,797
So, your baby has a large
tumor in his lower back.

335
00:14:13,822 --> 00:14:14,952
It's most likely benign,

336
00:14:14,977 --> 00:14:17,512
but because of its size
and vascular nature,

337
00:14:17,537 --> 00:14:20,206
it could cause an accumulation
of fluids in the baby.

338
00:14:20,231 --> 00:14:22,732
But the tumor can be removed, right?

339
00:14:23,632 --> 00:14:26,137
Dr. Bailey says amazing things about you,

340
00:14:26,162 --> 00:14:27,930
that you're one of the best.

341
00:14:27,955 --> 00:14:29,432
Bailey said that?

342
00:14:29,457 --> 00:14:31,058
How flattering.

343
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,617
That was Glenda Castillo.

344
00:14:32,765 --> 00:14:35,367
I told you no twice now.

345
00:14:35,392 --> 00:14:38,161
And you, how am I supposed
to trust you at all

346
00:14:38,186 --> 00:14:40,411
- when you pull something like that?
- She didn't do anything

347
00:14:40,436 --> 00:14:42,170
except try to get your help on a patient

348
00:14:42,195 --> 00:14:44,194
who needs your help.

349
00:14:44,219 --> 00:14:46,653
But if you heard her story,
if you knew she was...

350
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:48,160
Is that how Bailey convinced you?

351
00:14:48,185 --> 00:14:50,052
It's a tactic, Robbins,

352
00:14:50,077 --> 00:14:52,979
appealing to your sad, bleeding heart.

353
00:14:53,004 --> 00:14:54,505
Doesn't work with me.

354
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,998
Well, then, let me appeal to your ego.

355
00:14:56,023 --> 00:14:58,191
You walk around here telling
anyone who will listen

356
00:14:58,216 --> 00:14:59,342
that you're the best.

357
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:01,052
Well, then, be the best.

358
00:15:01,077 --> 00:15:03,445
You can save her baby's life,

359
00:15:03,696 --> 00:15:05,697
so save that baby's life!

360
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,994
No.

361
00:15:10,865 --> 00:15:11,995
Ohh.

362
00:15:14,844 --> 00:15:17,208
- What the hell?
- Robbins, drop it.

363
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:19,238
No, I get that... I get that
I've seen tumors like that before,

364
00:15:19,263 --> 00:15:20,734
but this can't all be about my education.

365
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:22,217
I mean, at some point, I have to...

366
00:15:22,231 --> 00:15:24,384
At some point, we have to make
decisions and stick to them.

367
00:15:24,409 --> 00:15:26,498
I wish we had time, but we don't.

368
00:15:26,523 --> 00:15:28,804
We have very little control
over the time we have,

369
00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:30,378
and we have a plan.

370
00:15:30,403 --> 00:15:31,761
Can't we make an exception?

371
00:15:31,786 --> 00:15:33,812
Can't we just, you know,
sort of adjust the plan?

372
00:15:33,837 --> 00:15:35,469
You... fine. You want to?

373
00:15:35,494 --> 00:15:36,843
Adjust the plan.

374
00:15:36,868 --> 00:15:38,187
What are you doing?

375
00:15:38,954 --> 00:15:40,533
Take down one of these cards

376
00:15:40,558 --> 00:15:42,225
so we have time to help Mrs. Castillo.

377
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,450
Which one?

378
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:45,990
How about Meghan Carlson...
congenital airway obstruction?

379
00:15:46,015 --> 00:15:47,463
Her husband's in Iraq right now.

380
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,956
Or Julie Hall... vasa previa.

381
00:15:49,981 --> 00:15:51,976
She went through two years
of fertility treatments.

382
00:15:52,001 --> 00:15:53,802
So, pick one.

383
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,662
Decide which baby doesn't get to live

384
00:15:55,687 --> 00:15:57,491
so Glenda Castillo's does.

385
00:15:57,516 --> 00:15:58,516
Go ahead.

386
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,210
Pick a card. You choose.

387
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,918
That's what I thought.

388
00:16:14,597 --> 00:16:16,711
_

389
00:16:32,118 --> 00:16:33,485
No.

390
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:34,929
No.

391
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:37,222
Get me out!

392
00:16:37,256 --> 00:16:39,344
Get me out of here!

393
00:16:39,692 --> 00:16:40,692
Get me out!

394
00:16:40,726 --> 00:16:42,393
- You have to.
- I don't.

395
00:16:42,428 --> 00:16:44,162
The radiation treatments are going to help.

396
00:16:44,196 --> 00:16:45,779
They are gonna shrink
the borders of the tumor,

397
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:47,237
which will make it easier to resect.

398
00:16:47,262 --> 00:16:48,784
It's a minimal gain for you.

399
00:16:48,834 --> 00:16:51,836
I will take what I can get.
I am trying to save your life!

400
00:16:51,871 --> 00:16:54,372
You are making me feel
like I've already died.

401
00:16:54,406 --> 00:16:56,307
I'm sick. I'm losing my hair.

402
00:16:56,332 --> 00:16:58,633
I refuse to spend the
last few months of my life

403
00:16:58,658 --> 00:17:00,126
feeling like a pile of crap.

404
00:17:00,151 --> 00:17:02,877
No more. That's final.

405
00:17:03,048 --> 00:17:05,206
Dr. Stanley, please report...

406
00:17:05,231 --> 00:17:07,506
I am going to give you
more than a few months.

407
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:10,537
I am going to save your life.

408
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:13,352
And I am about to get up in
front of a bunch of people

409
00:17:13,392 --> 00:17:15,460
and tell them how I plan on doing it.

410
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:17,913
It makes it really hard for me to do that

411
00:17:17,938 --> 00:17:20,038
or even care about doing that

412
00:17:20,063 --> 00:17:21,930
when you don't seem to care at all!

413
00:17:21,955 --> 00:17:24,257
Well, that's your problem.

414
00:17:29,197 --> 00:17:31,498
Well, the word's spreading.

415
00:17:31,523 --> 00:17:33,057
This was a good idea, Hunt...

416
00:17:33,082 --> 00:17:35,583
a master class in neurosurgery.

417
00:17:35,608 --> 00:17:37,542
This is gonna put Amelia
Shepherd on the map.

418
00:17:37,567 --> 00:17:38,968
Mm. Unless it fails.

419
00:17:38,993 --> 00:17:40,227
It won't.

420
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:42,344
If it does...

421
00:17:42,931 --> 00:17:44,843
There's a lesson in that, too.

422
00:17:48,414 --> 00:17:51,181
So, she just spitballs this stuff with you?

423
00:17:51,206 --> 00:17:53,941
It's just the two of you
hanging out, talking tumor?

424
00:17:53,966 --> 00:17:55,166
Pretty much.

425
00:17:55,191 --> 00:17:56,925
I want to talk tumor!

426
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,498
- I want to talk tumor so bad.
- Shh!

427
00:17:59,757 --> 00:18:02,739
- Oh, my God. Look at that thing
- Yeah.

428
00:18:02,775 --> 00:18:06,005
Previous attempts to treat Dr.
Herman's tumor with radiation

429
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,898
proved unsuccessful.

430
00:18:08,036 --> 00:18:11,425
I had hoped to use high radioactive doses

431
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,084
to reduce the margins,

432
00:18:13,118 --> 00:18:14,484
but at this juncture,

433
00:18:14,521 --> 00:18:17,623
that course seems to be unrealistic.

434
00:18:18,928 --> 00:18:20,763
But that's not enough to make me quit.

435
00:18:21,298 --> 00:18:26,804
This tumor is fierce and
intimidating and aggressive,

436
00:18:27,061 --> 00:18:28,194
but so am I.

437
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:33,911
Now, the trick to this is,

438
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,347
you can't touch the vessel
while you're lasering the mass...

439
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:38,382
not even a little bit. If you do...

440
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,584
The field fills with
blood, obscuring the camera,

441
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,320
and visualization is compromised.

442
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:45,556
First, I need to see
the tumor, all of it...

443
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:48,426
every margin, every last ripple and ridge.

444
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,394
So, what do you do?

445
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:51,886
I have two choices...

446
00:18:51,886 --> 00:18:53,831
open her up and stop the bleeding if I can,

447
00:18:53,865 --> 00:18:56,367
or deliver the baby
regardless of how early.

448
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:57,435
Very good.

449
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,811
So, I will employ fluorescein dye

450
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,340
to delineate every border of the tumor,

451
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:05,509
to help me anticipate
every possible problem

452
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,278
before I get to it.

453
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,946
I don't want to leave
anything up to chance.

454
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:12,083
What happened?

455
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:13,084
The pressure's dropped.

456
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:14,785
She's in a lot of pain, and she's cramping.

457
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,987
It hurts! It hurts, it hurts!

458
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:18,089
It's okay, Julie. We've
got you, we've got you.

459
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:19,023
She has a vasa previa.

460
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:20,691
She's scheduled for an ablation tomorrow.

461
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,927
I've been trying to get
her pressure back up,

462
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:24,562
but there is no fetal heartbeat.

463
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,165
Damn it. Where's her husband?

464
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:31,643
Is that blood?! I'm bleeding?!

465
00:19:31,668 --> 00:19:33,429
- Gown me.
- Keep him out of here.

466
00:19:33,454 --> 00:19:35,943
Robbins, you're gonna get this
baby out right here, right now.

467
00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:36,988
Here?

468
00:19:37,013 --> 00:19:38,847
We need a C-section tray set up in here.

469
00:19:38,872 --> 00:19:40,363
Call peds. Get an incubator, stat.

470
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:41,655
Wait! What?! I'm gonna have the baby now?!

471
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,248
Julie, I'm gonna give you
something to calm you down, okay?

472
00:19:44,273 --> 00:19:46,207
I never had to do a crash
C on my own before, okay?

473
00:19:46,232 --> 00:19:47,466
- I mean, not like this.
- You know what to do.

474
00:19:47,491 --> 00:19:50,205
It's the same three basic steps,
just like any other C-section...

475
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,275
Open the abdomen, open the uterus, deliver.

476
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,534
Okay, I'm okay.

477
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,026
Pressure's steady at 100/60.

478
00:19:55,051 --> 00:19:56,585
- Okay, I can do this.
- Betadine.

479
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:57,637
Okay.

480
00:19:58,191 --> 00:20:00,345
- Robbins?
- I'll do... I'll do this.

481
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,437
It's fine, Robbins.

482
00:20:01,462 --> 00:20:02,496
I'll do it.

483
00:20:02,521 --> 00:20:03,755
Scalpel.

484
00:20:08,946 --> 00:20:10,313
I'm so sorry.

485
00:20:10,338 --> 00:20:12,272
We did everything we could do.

486
00:20:14,156 --> 00:20:16,424
I'm so sorry.

487
00:20:26,256 --> 00:20:29,158
Good job. Let's go.

488
00:20:34,118 --> 00:20:35,652
Stop crying.

489
00:20:35,686 --> 00:20:37,096
Oh, for the love of...

490
00:20:37,121 --> 00:20:38,508
- Stop crying!
- I'm...

491
00:20:38,533 --> 00:20:40,100
Stop it now! Just...

492
00:20:40,851 --> 00:20:42,585
Stop it right now.

493
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:49,240
There's no time for crying.

494
00:20:50,642 --> 00:20:51,976
We have work to do.

495
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:57,722
What?

496
00:20:57,747 --> 00:20:59,781
How can you even...

497
00:20:59,806 --> 00:21:01,340
'Cause that's the way it goes, Robbins.

498
00:21:03,573 --> 00:21:05,081
Call Bailey.

499
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,681
Tell her we're on.

500
00:21:16,081 --> 00:21:18,403
_

501
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,784
_

502
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:27,845
Now, arguably, the most
important part of the brain

503
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,211
is the part that makes us hope...

504
00:21:31,216 --> 00:21:32,710
Dream...

505
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:34,811
Imagine.

506
00:21:35,154 --> 00:21:38,022
One singular, almost immeasurable part

507
00:21:38,056 --> 00:21:41,909
is what makes you you...

508
00:21:42,064 --> 00:21:44,199
And me me...

509
00:21:44,663 --> 00:21:47,165
And everyone... Everyone.

510
00:21:47,199 --> 00:21:50,034
It's technically called the fornix,

511
00:21:50,068 --> 00:21:52,610
but I call it the "dream box."

512
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:57,455
The question is...

513
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,816
What happens when the
dream box is being invaded,

514
00:22:00,841 --> 00:22:05,025
when a tumor is so large, so demanding,

515
00:22:05,364 --> 00:22:07,356
it's sucking the dream box dry?

516
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:09,020
It's taking over...

517
00:22:09,054 --> 00:22:12,264
it's stealing away hopes and dreams.

518
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:17,193
Imagine, when that tumor is removed,

519
00:22:17,218 --> 00:22:20,264
what... what will actually be left?

520
00:22:21,099 --> 00:22:23,863
Or, rather, who is left?

521
00:22:25,337 --> 00:22:27,063
Anything?

522
00:22:27,851 --> 00:22:29,264
Anyone?

523
00:22:30,709 --> 00:22:32,675
I remember my mom telling me once

524
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,079
that when we die, we go to heaven.

525
00:22:35,113 --> 00:22:37,014
I couldn't picture it.

526
00:22:37,049 --> 00:22:40,251
All I could imagine was
what we see in cartoons...

527
00:22:40,285 --> 00:22:43,746
little people in robes with
wings, sitting on clouds.

528
00:22:43,771 --> 00:22:46,109
But nobody really knows
what's up there, do they?

529
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:47,291
When I was a kid,

530
00:22:47,326 --> 00:22:49,827
I used to think that we
were like dandelions...

531
00:22:49,862 --> 00:22:54,514
like, the part that makes
us us would just blow away

532
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,108
and land and grow into...

533
00:22:56,133 --> 00:22:57,734
I don't want to be buried, by the way.

534
00:22:57,759 --> 00:22:59,982
- Have me cremated.
- W... Excuse me?

535
00:23:00,007 --> 00:23:01,941
If I survive the surgery but don't wake up,

536
00:23:01,966 --> 00:23:04,701
give me five days... a week, tops...

537
00:23:04,726 --> 00:23:06,026
- then pull the plug.
- This is...

538
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,485
We don't need to be talking about this.

539
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:10,111
If I do wake up but I'm
dependent on vents or tubes,

540
00:23:10,136 --> 00:23:11,768
pull the plug then, too.

541
00:23:11,793 --> 00:23:14,294
You know what? You're
not... you're not dying.

542
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:16,145
You're not gonna wake
up gorked. Shepherd knows

543
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:18,010
- what she's doing. She does.
- Okay. Sure.

544
00:23:18,035 --> 00:23:19,669
- She does!
- I heard you.

545
00:23:22,439 --> 00:23:24,207
That bird is gonna poop on us.

546
00:23:24,232 --> 00:23:25,332
Oh...

547
00:23:25,357 --> 00:23:27,614
- What's next today?
- Glenda Castillo.

548
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:29,206
I'm so glad you brought me back in.

549
00:23:29,231 --> 00:23:31,048
Have a look.

550
00:23:31,836 --> 00:23:33,510
Well, the teratoma has grown.

551
00:23:33,535 --> 00:23:35,151
It's showing early signs of hydrops.

552
00:23:36,412 --> 00:23:39,658
- Is everything okay?
- Glenda, your baby's retaining fluid,

553
00:23:39,683 --> 00:23:41,951
which is starting to affect his heart.

554
00:23:41,976 --> 00:23:44,077
I'm recommending we do the surgery tonight.

555
00:23:44,102 --> 00:23:45,136
Tonight?

556
00:23:45,161 --> 00:23:46,628
No, that's way too soon.

557
00:23:46,653 --> 00:23:48,921
The tumor is creating
pressure on your placenta.

558
00:23:48,946 --> 00:23:51,080
It's not only endangering the baby,

559
00:23:51,105 --> 00:23:52,903
but now it's putting you at risk.

560
00:23:52,928 --> 00:23:55,363
But my baby wouldn't survive, would he,

561
00:23:55,388 --> 00:23:56,906
if you suddenly had to deliver?

562
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,929
'Cause I'm only 24 weeks along,

563
00:23:58,954 --> 00:24:01,310
and I know that it would help
him if he had time to grow, right?

564
00:24:01,335 --> 00:24:02,936
If I could just hold on
for a few more weeks...

565
00:24:02,961 --> 00:24:04,437
It's not what's best for you.

566
00:24:04,462 --> 00:24:05,660
I don't care about me.

567
00:24:05,685 --> 00:24:07,722
Glenda, if Dr. Herman thinks that...

568
00:24:07,747 --> 00:24:09,552
No, my husband is dead.

569
00:24:10,117 --> 00:24:12,736
But this baby that is inside of me,

570
00:24:12,761 --> 00:24:15,694
this baby of ours, I cannot risk his life.

571
00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:16,986
I won't.

572
00:24:17,011 --> 00:24:18,354
So, if there is a choice

573
00:24:18,379 --> 00:24:20,743
between helping me or helping my baby,

574
00:24:20,768 --> 00:24:22,101
I choose my baby.

575
00:24:23,852 --> 00:24:26,086
What does she think
we're trying to do here?

576
00:24:26,111 --> 00:24:28,112
I am not negotiating with a patient.

577
00:24:28,137 --> 00:24:30,986
I am the doctor. I'm gonna
tell her when we're go...

578
00:24:32,351 --> 00:24:33,918
I'm sorry.

579
00:24:33,943 --> 00:24:35,537
- Robbins, what's the hell?
- What's funny about this?

580
00:24:35,562 --> 00:24:37,730
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's just... it's just...

581
00:24:37,755 --> 00:24:40,557
it's funny listening to
you get so bent out of shape

582
00:24:40,582 --> 00:24:42,233
when this is the exact same thing

583
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:45,065
that you've been doing to Amelia Shepherd
ever since she offered to save her life.

584
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,658
I mean, she has. Exactly.

585
00:24:46,691 --> 00:24:49,052
"We'll do the surgery when I'm ready."

586
00:24:49,077 --> 00:24:51,854
And it's so frustrating. It's
torture, and it drives us crazy.

587
00:24:51,879 --> 00:24:54,022
So, it's just fun to
watch it happen to you.

588
00:24:54,047 --> 00:24:55,081
It's like divine justice.

589
00:24:55,106 --> 00:24:56,382
Pretend that I'm not here.

590
00:24:56,407 --> 00:24:57,671
Keep going.

591
00:25:00,091 --> 00:25:02,826
I will give Ms. Castillo an extra week,

592
00:25:02,851 --> 00:25:04,685
but I want her admitted.

593
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:07,138
And if she so much as hiccups funny,

594
00:25:07,163 --> 00:25:09,555
- I'm taking her to surgery.
- J... understood.

595
00:25:10,088 --> 00:25:12,790
Hey, thank you for taking her case.

596
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:17,058
Oh, shut up.

597
00:25:24,217 --> 00:25:25,985
I can't...

598
00:25:31,698 --> 00:25:36,869
How do I access that area of
the brain when it's so hidden?

599
00:25:36,894 --> 00:25:39,247
And once I access that area,

600
00:25:39,272 --> 00:25:42,360
even with the perfect tools,
the perfect approach...

601
00:25:44,351 --> 00:25:46,425
How do I keep from screwing it up?

602
00:25:49,523 --> 00:25:51,826
If there's edema, it's post-fixed.

603
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:53,562
It's too narrow, too close the fornix.

604
00:25:53,587 --> 00:25:55,741
If I hit the hypothalamus, game over.

605
00:25:55,766 --> 00:25:58,044
Not gonna work, not gonna
work, not gonna work.

606
00:26:01,116 --> 00:26:02,407
Do you want some food?

607
00:26:02,419 --> 00:26:04,237
Have I figured this out yet?

608
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:05,262
No.

609
00:26:13,729 --> 00:26:15,856
This has never been done before.

610
00:26:15,881 --> 00:26:20,169
All these steps in this
order on this kind of tumor

611
00:26:20,194 --> 00:26:22,229
has never been done.

612
00:26:22,254 --> 00:26:24,255
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

613
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,816
Who do I even think I am?
Who am I to even try this?

614
00:26:27,841 --> 00:26:29,007
Okay, a bad thing.

615
00:26:34,651 --> 00:26:37,063
Have you called your brother?

616
00:26:40,591 --> 00:26:41,963
I know. You don't need him.

617
00:26:41,988 --> 00:26:44,590
I was just thinking you could,

618
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:47,361
just to have someone to
bounce these ideas off of

619
00:26:47,386 --> 00:26:50,471
who understands this kind of
thing the way that you do...

620
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:52,531
A peer.

621
00:26:53,267 --> 00:26:55,168
He might have a suggestion.

622
00:26:55,193 --> 00:26:56,990
I do not need my brother!

623
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:59,516
I am not stuck! I am thinking!

624
00:26:59,541 --> 00:27:00,896
I am figuring it out!

625
00:27:00,921 --> 00:27:03,256
I am right on the edge of figuring it out,

626
00:27:03,281 --> 00:27:05,496
of making the breakthrough of a lifetime!

627
00:27:05,521 --> 00:27:06,653
I am this close!

628
00:27:06,678 --> 00:27:08,946
My genius is flying
around this room right now,

629
00:27:08,971 --> 00:27:10,808
trying to find a clear path to land on me,

630
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:12,711
but I can't clear the runway for landing

631
00:27:12,736 --> 00:27:14,303
because I can't find any quiet

632
00:27:14,328 --> 00:27:17,469
because some idiot resident
keeps talking to me!

633
00:27:25,624 --> 00:27:28,754
I didn't mean it. I'm
tired, and I'm frustrated.

634
00:27:28,779 --> 00:27:30,025
I...

635
00:27:30,434 --> 00:27:32,468
I am so sorry. I just

636
00:27:34,477 --> 00:27:36,912
This tumor is making me crazy.

637
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,710
Edwards.

638
00:27:38,735 --> 00:27:41,070
As bad as you want to get that tumor,

639
00:27:41,095 --> 00:27:44,564
that's as bad as I want to
watch you get that tumor.

640
00:27:44,685 --> 00:27:48,955
You're tired and frustrated
and terrified, but guess what.

641
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,245
I don't give a damn.

642
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:52,176
You're supposed to be my mentor.

643
00:27:52,383 --> 00:27:54,274
You are my mentor.

644
00:27:54,553 --> 00:27:59,557
I believe in you, I look
up to you, I want to be you.

645
00:27:59,756 --> 00:28:02,072
That's an enormous responsibility,

646
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:04,176
so don't call me names.

647
00:28:04,277 --> 00:28:08,482
And stop pouting because you
don't understand what to do.

648
00:28:08,507 --> 00:28:12,944
Be worthy of being believed
in, of being looked up to.

649
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,518
Or if you can't actually be worthy,

650
00:28:15,552 --> 00:28:17,397
if I am actually wasting my time,

651
00:28:17,422 --> 00:28:20,078
if there is nothing about
you that is special or wise,

652
00:28:20,103 --> 00:28:21,203
for God's sake,

653
00:28:21,228 --> 00:28:23,850
at least have the decency
to pretend that there is.

654
00:28:25,187 --> 00:28:28,289
Get it together, Dr. Shepherd.

655
00:28:42,175 --> 00:28:44,694
Get it together, Dr. Shepherd.

656
00:29:04,975 --> 00:29:06,694
_

657
00:29:15,952 --> 00:29:17,352
Okay, bye.

658
00:29:17,387 --> 00:29:19,621
Bye.

659
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:25,019
- Hey. Um, how are you?
- Uh, good.

660
00:29:25,044 --> 00:29:27,175
How's Dr. Herman? Is she
good? Is everything good?

661
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,407
Yeah, I mean, she's killing me
with back-to-back surgeries but...

662
00:29:29,432 --> 00:29:31,500
Yeah, and Amelia's
plan? You good with that?

663
00:29:31,534 --> 00:29:33,869
- Callie, what are you...
- What?

664
00:29:33,903 --> 00:29:35,904
I'm not... I'm just checking in, okay?

665
00:29:35,938 --> 00:29:39,908
I'm just... Seeing how
you are and, uh, how, um...

666
00:29:39,942 --> 00:29:41,710
- Callie?
- Well, it just seems like

667
00:29:41,744 --> 00:29:43,912
you and Dr. Herman are getting
along really, really well,

668
00:29:43,946 --> 00:29:45,714
and you used to complain
that she was killing you,

669
00:29:45,748 --> 00:29:47,249
but now you're happy
that she's killing you,

670
00:29:47,283 --> 00:29:48,884
and it seems like you
really, really like her.

671
00:29:48,918 --> 00:29:50,886
I do. Actually, I do. She's great.

672
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,964
- She's... I mean, she's amazing.
- And she's sick.

673
00:29:52,989 --> 00:29:55,390
- So, I worry.
- Amelia's got it covered.

674
00:29:55,425 --> 00:29:57,959
- She's gonna be fine.
- I worry about you.

675
00:29:57,994 --> 00:29:59,060
I know I shouldn't.

676
00:29:59,095 --> 00:30:02,397
I know it's none of my
business, but, uh, old habits.

677
00:30:02,432 --> 00:30:04,072
Well, that's, um...

678
00:30:04,934 --> 00:30:06,034
Thanks.

679
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:10,305
- Oh, I got to go.
- Okay, okay.

680
00:30:10,339 --> 00:30:11,373
Wow, that's tall.

681
00:30:11,407 --> 00:30:13,375
Yeah. Really big.

682
00:30:16,846 --> 00:30:19,714
Just so you know, the auditorium is packed.

683
00:30:19,749 --> 00:30:22,050
The fire marshall actually
made me move a bunch of people

684
00:30:22,084 --> 00:30:23,552
out to an overflow room.

685
00:30:25,955 --> 00:30:27,622
Amelia.

686
00:30:27,657 --> 00:30:28,864
Just give me a minute.

687
00:30:29,258 --> 00:30:30,859
- Amelia.
- Shh!

688
00:30:30,884 --> 00:30:31,918
Hang on.

689
00:30:35,164 --> 00:30:36,898
You can talk to me.

690
00:30:36,933 --> 00:30:38,834
You're wound pretty tight.

691
00:30:39,476 --> 00:30:42,912
I just want you to know you can talk to me.

692
00:30:47,311 --> 00:30:49,813
My whole career, I have
been the other Dr. Shepherd.

693
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:53,321
He's the real one. I'm the other one.

694
00:30:55,284 --> 00:30:57,920
Right now, this plan
of mine is theoretical.

695
00:30:58,881 --> 00:31:00,515
It's just talk.

696
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,756
But at some point,

697
00:31:01,781 --> 00:31:03,949
I am going to slice
into Dr. Herman's brain,

698
00:31:03,993 --> 00:31:06,862
and I have this sick feeling

699
00:31:06,896 --> 00:31:09,931
that when I face that tumor,

700
00:31:10,881 --> 00:31:14,803
I will discover that I am not
just the other Dr. Shepherd...

701
00:31:17,702 --> 00:31:19,896
I'm the wrong Dr. Shepherd.

702
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,381
Hey.

703
00:31:29,018 --> 00:31:31,233
911? What's going on?

704
00:31:34,494 --> 00:31:36,595
Look, I know you've been having
me take the lead so I can learn,

705
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,921
but you need to handle this case.

706
00:31:37,946 --> 00:31:39,855
- Why would I do that?
- Because it's emergent,

707
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,414
and I've never tried
cutting umbilical bands.

708
00:31:41,439 --> 00:31:43,175
- First time for everything.
- Well...

709
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,600
Listen to me, okay?

710
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:45,926
I'm not ready to take this over yet.

711
00:31:46,035 --> 00:31:47,536
Doesn't matter.

712
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:49,704
Stop! Stop!

713
00:31:49,739 --> 00:31:51,962
You... You're not hearing me.

714
00:31:51,987 --> 00:31:53,587
It does matter. I'm not ready.

715
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:55,613
And you think I am?

716
00:31:55,638 --> 00:31:57,873
You think this is easy for me?

717
00:31:57,898 --> 00:31:59,065
You think I'm ready?

718
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,528
I was fine. I got fine with dying.

719
00:32:03,553 --> 00:32:05,854
And then you infected
me with your stupid...

720
00:32:05,879 --> 00:32:09,515
with Shepherd and her
plan and your stupid hope.

721
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:12,408
And now it's harder than ever

722
00:32:12,762 --> 00:32:14,805
to hand all this over.

723
00:32:15,523 --> 00:32:16,957
I don't want to.

724
00:32:17,366 --> 00:32:19,605
I'm scared to.

725
00:32:19,792 --> 00:32:21,912
And I'm scared to let go of it,

726
00:32:21,937 --> 00:32:24,105
and it's all your fault, so...

727
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:28,065
I think the very least
you could do is deserve it.

728
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:31,523
Take over, do well, make me not regret it.

729
00:32:31,548 --> 00:32:32,647
Can you do that?

730
00:32:33,716 --> 00:32:35,083
Please?

731
00:32:35,793 --> 00:32:37,427
This is the part

732
00:32:37,452 --> 00:32:39,920
where things get a little fast and furious.

733
00:32:39,945 --> 00:32:42,914
It is arguably the most dangerous,

734
00:32:42,939 --> 00:32:46,575
most precarious portion of the operation.

735
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,469
It also needs to happen the fastest.

736
00:32:49,494 --> 00:32:53,464
Every step, every move before this

737
00:32:53,489 --> 00:32:55,424
has laid the groundwork
for this very moment,

738
00:32:55,449 --> 00:32:58,718
the moment where I place
the radioactive seeds.

739
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:00,544
It requires precision...

740
00:33:00,569 --> 00:33:02,737
I just need to slip these
shears under the band.

741
00:33:02,762 --> 00:33:05,096
And accuracy and speed...

742
00:33:05,121 --> 00:33:07,756
things that do not go together well.

743
00:33:07,781 --> 00:33:09,232
I can't get the last band.

744
00:33:09,257 --> 00:33:10,757
This grip's not flexible enough.

745
00:33:10,976 --> 00:33:12,843
Can you coax it through?

746
00:33:12,868 --> 00:33:15,536
Mm. It's not... no. It won't give.

747
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:17,602
- You have to cut that last band.
- I know.

748
00:33:17,627 --> 00:33:20,362
- Have you tried a smaller scissor?
- Mm. It's not the problem.

749
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:24,023
Imagine picking up little grains of salt

750
00:33:24,166 --> 00:33:25,967
while wearing oven mitts.

751
00:33:26,002 --> 00:33:29,537
That is what I'm doing
inside somebody's brain.

752
00:33:29,562 --> 00:33:31,582
- Hand me a glove.
- What?

753
00:33:31,607 --> 00:33:33,174
Somebody hand me a glove. Scissors.

754
00:33:33,209 --> 00:33:35,610
There's this thing that
we used to do in peds.

755
00:33:35,645 --> 00:33:37,079
I think it'll work.

756
00:33:37,104 --> 00:33:38,638
I just need a more flexible opening,

757
00:33:38,663 --> 00:33:40,194
and I can make it out of a glove.

758
00:33:40,219 --> 00:33:41,686
That's not in my notes, Robbins.

759
00:33:52,901 --> 00:33:55,179
- Are you serious?
- It's gonna work.

760
00:33:55,443 --> 00:33:58,212
But once I do it,

761
00:33:58,842 --> 00:34:01,703
once I place the final seed,

762
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:04,771
well...

763
00:34:05,131 --> 00:34:06,868
It's smooth sailing.

764
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:09,078
Ha! Did you see that?!

765
00:34:09,103 --> 00:34:12,839
It worked! It... it...
it absolutely worked!

766
00:34:16,085 --> 00:34:18,486
'Night, 'night, tumor baby.

767
00:34:18,521 --> 00:34:21,039
It has been lovely,

768
00:34:21,857 --> 00:34:23,158
but we are done.

769
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:36,806
I'd like to open things
up to a few questions.

770
00:34:36,831 --> 00:34:38,265
Yes.

771
00:34:38,574 --> 00:34:40,008
Are you nervous?

772
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,322
Uh...

773
00:34:42,347 --> 00:34:44,572
I'd be crazy not to be.

774
00:34:44,597 --> 00:34:47,566
Yes, of course I'm nervous,
but I'm also very excited.

775
00:34:47,894 --> 00:34:50,162
This is history.

776
00:34:50,187 --> 00:34:51,802
This surgery will be history.

777
00:34:53,756 --> 00:34:55,571
How could I not be excited about that?

778
00:34:56,625 --> 00:34:59,778
Excellent, excellent.

779
00:35:00,029 --> 00:35:01,796
You should be very proud of yourself.

780
00:35:04,384 --> 00:35:05,751
Close up now.

781
00:35:05,776 --> 00:35:07,910
Where are you going?

782
00:35:08,471 --> 00:35:12,128
What you're describing is
seven different surgeries

783
00:35:12,153 --> 00:35:14,964
all using the hardest
techniques you've ever tried.

784
00:35:14,989 --> 00:35:18,545
How long do you anticipate the
entire surgery actually taking?

785
00:35:18,589 --> 00:35:20,723
18 hours...

786
00:35:20,748 --> 00:35:22,415
Give or take some hours.

787
00:35:23,646 --> 00:35:25,247
Uh, follow-up question...

788
00:35:25,272 --> 00:35:27,914
do you need a second resident on the case?

789
00:35:27,939 --> 00:35:30,946
Uh, not unless Edwards
is planning to bail on me.

790
00:35:30,971 --> 00:35:32,572
You planning to bail, Edwards?

791
00:35:32,949 --> 00:35:34,216
No, ma'am.

792
00:35:40,212 --> 00:35:42,513
Yes, in the back.

793
00:35:42,538 --> 00:35:44,205
Will you have help?

794
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:46,999
Um... Sorry?

795
00:35:47,024 --> 00:35:48,191
Well, I'm just, uh...

796
00:35:48,216 --> 00:35:50,551
Well, are you gonna be doing
this whole surgery yourself,

797
00:35:50,576 --> 00:35:52,344
or is Derek... uh, Dr. Shepherd coming?

798
00:35:52,369 --> 00:35:55,405
I'm... I'm just... I'm just asking.

799
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:57,487
I mean, given everything,
is it a good idea?

800
00:35:57,512 --> 00:35:59,280
Should you be doing this yourself?

801
00:36:01,245 --> 00:36:04,981
Well, I am, so...

802
00:36:06,446 --> 00:36:07,779
Next question.

803
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:18,136
I need you to scan me.

804
00:36:19,247 --> 00:36:23,428
Something's happening. I'm
experiencing symptoms...

805
00:36:23,613 --> 00:36:27,930
fuzziness around the edges,
a little like, uh, blinders,

806
00:36:27,955 --> 00:36:33,693
and it's, uh, dark... darker
than it should be, I think.

807
00:36:36,533 --> 00:36:38,441
Okay.

808
00:36:40,093 --> 00:36:41,640
Let's go.

809
00:37:15,929 --> 00:37:17,296
- Bailey?
- Where's Dr. Herman?

810
00:37:17,321 --> 00:37:19,122
She stepped out. What do you need?

811
00:37:19,147 --> 00:37:21,853
Uh... It's Glenda Castillo.

812
00:37:23,718 --> 00:37:25,085
Hey, I need Herman right now.

813
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,990
Glenda Castillo's baby is in distress,

814
00:37:27,015 --> 00:37:28,448
and Glenda is severely hypertensive,

815
00:37:28,473 --> 00:37:29,906
showing signs of heart failure.

816
00:37:29,931 --> 00:37:31,965
We need to operate on her immediately,

817
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:33,653
so if you could finish up...

818
00:37:34,451 --> 00:37:35,645
What are you doing?

819
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,671
- Why are you standing there? I...
- Arizona.

820
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,334
Oh, God.

821
00:37:44,765 --> 00:37:45,932
It's time.

822
00:37:46,893 --> 00:37:48,401
Now?

823
00:37:52,406 --> 00:37:54,211
I'm gonna go...

824
00:37:56,249 --> 00:37:57,749
Get an O.R. ready.

825
00:37:57,774 --> 00:37:58,915
Okay.

826
00:37:59,666 --> 00:38:00,933
Okay.

827
00:38:03,025 --> 00:38:04,419
You ready for this?

828
00:38:07,261 --> 00:38:09,062
Mm-hmm.

829
00:38:10,474 --> 00:38:11,675
Amelia.

830
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:14,765
I'll get an O.R. prepped.

831
00:38:16,135 --> 00:38:17,969
You'll inform the patient?

832
00:38:25,266 --> 00:38:27,111
Oh. Robbins.

833
00:38:27,146 --> 00:38:28,579
Surgery's all finished?

834
00:38:28,614 --> 00:38:30,114
Yeah.

835
00:38:32,451 --> 00:38:35,374
I see.

836
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:37,788
Shepherd's prepping the O.R.?

837
00:38:38,307 --> 00:38:39,924
Yes.

838
00:38:39,958 --> 00:38:44,729
If I had to guess, I'd say the
tumor's invaded the optic chiasm.

839
00:38:47,299 --> 00:38:48,736
Ah.

840
00:38:49,168 --> 00:38:50,635
My chariot awaits.

841
00:38:53,138 --> 00:38:54,605
A little privacy, guys?

842
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:01,112
Did you, uh, need me for
something... a patient?

843
00:39:01,146 --> 00:39:02,509
Um, yeah.

844
00:39:02,534 --> 00:39:04,291
Glenda Castillo's baby has hydrops.

845
00:39:04,316 --> 00:39:06,725
Mom is mirroring, and she's going into CHF.

846
00:39:06,756 --> 00:39:08,352
Wow.

847
00:39:08,687 --> 00:39:11,055
Looks like a big day for both of us.

848
00:39:11,089 --> 00:39:13,291
What you need to do first

849
00:39:13,325 --> 00:39:16,227
is try to embolize the
vessels fetoscopically.

850
00:39:16,261 --> 00:39:18,496
Make sure her blood pressure is stabilized.

851
00:39:19,095 --> 00:39:20,865
She has you.

852
00:39:21,023 --> 00:39:22,134
Amelia has you.

853
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:24,760
This is the point where
you trust her, okay?

854
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:27,597
Don't go in without checking
Glenda's platelet counts

855
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:28,863
and crossmatching.

856
00:39:28,888 --> 00:39:31,856
This is the point where
you trust her, okay?

857
00:39:32,709 --> 00:39:34,710
All set.

858
00:39:34,925 --> 00:39:36,882
Don't let Glenda's
platelet count drop below...

859
00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:38,116
100. I know.

860
00:39:38,141 --> 00:39:39,642
- Will you tie me?
- Yeah.

861
00:40:06,436 --> 00:40:07,670
Let's do this.

862
00:40:32,998 --> 00:40:34,549
I never placed much value

863
00:40:34,574 --> 00:40:36,335
in wondering about an afterlife.

864
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,428
My concern was always this life,

865
00:40:38,453 --> 00:40:40,153
what would I do with it?

866
00:40:40,178 --> 00:40:41,711
How would I make my mark?

867
00:40:41,736 --> 00:40:44,538
Be sure, be fast. You don't
have half the time you imagine.

868
00:40:44,563 --> 00:40:46,931
Try to ablate all the vessels,
but don't wait too long.

869
00:40:46,956 --> 00:40:48,120
Don't be afraid to make that call.

870
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:50,452
If she's awake, she'll
tell you for the 15th time

871
00:40:50,477 --> 00:40:52,162
to save her child's life before hers.

872
00:40:52,187 --> 00:40:53,854
Listen to her, let her say her piece,

873
00:40:53,888 --> 00:40:55,830
- then you do what needs to be done.
- I don't think...

874
00:40:55,855 --> 00:40:57,871
I don't... I don't know...
I don't know if I can do this.

875
00:40:57,896 --> 00:40:59,263
- I can't. I can't do this.
- You can.

876
00:40:59,288 --> 00:41:01,256
- Nicole.
- You will.

877
00:41:02,235 --> 00:41:04,636
Let's get you inside now, okay?

878
00:41:04,789 --> 00:41:07,324
I wanted to break new ground.

879
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:17,228
I wanted my life, my brain, my existence...

880
00:41:19,712 --> 00:41:22,213
To mean something.

881
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,054
Hey, hey, hey, You're gonna be fine, okay?

882
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:31,581
Amelia's got this. You've got this.

883
00:41:31,866 --> 00:41:34,835
The thing that I never
really thought about, though,

884
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:37,495
the thing I never really
wrapped my brain around

885
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,887
until now was...

886
00:41:42,063 --> 00:41:43,263
Wait, Robbins.

887
00:41:43,288 --> 00:41:44,689
No.

888
00:41:44,714 --> 00:41:45,981
Don't you dare.

889
00:41:46,006 --> 00:41:47,806
Don't you dare say it, Nicole.

890
00:41:47,831 --> 00:41:50,833
In order to do that, in
order to be remembered,

891
00:41:50,858 --> 00:41:53,910
in order to leave something
significant behind...

892
00:41:54,355 --> 00:41:55,855
Time to go.

893
00:42:11,345 --> 00:42:13,713
You have to leave.
