1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,271
E. R.

2
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:06,994
Previously on E. R.

3
00:00:06,995 --> 00:00:09,320
This is Dr. McNulty,
formerly of Curtain 2.

4
00:00:09,321 --> 00:00:11,403
He needs a head CT, CBC,
Chem-7, urinalysis.

5
00:00:11,438 --> 00:00:14,367
- When was your last tetanus shot?
- 1949.

6
00:00:14,502 --> 00:00:16,359
You have a license for this?

7
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,309
Why'd you get beat up?

8
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,616
I didn't have the gun
when they asked for it.

9
00:00:24,117 --> 00:00:26,525
We gotta get it back, G. They want it.

10
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,576
I can't find the heartbeat.

11
00:00:28,954 --> 00:00:30,691
Here, let me try.

12
00:00:34,021 --> 00:00:35,958
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:37,266 --> 00:00:40,183
E. R. 9x12 "A SAINT IN THE CITY"

14
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:45,433
He's a hard worker, he's strong,
he's got a great attitude.

15
00:00:45,607 --> 00:00:48,524
- How's he gonna work with a bad hand?
- It don't hurt.

16
00:00:48,693 --> 00:00:52,986
- The cast will be off in three weeks.
- Cool, G. You said six before.

17
00:00:53,155 --> 00:00:55,646
I've seen you around, right?
You work upstairs.

18
00:00:55,824 --> 00:00:58,659
Yeah. I'm an ER resident.
All part of the County family.

19
00:00:58,827 --> 00:01:02,658
I hate doctors. Y'all think you�re
the queen of the damn Rose Parade.

20
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,870
I'm not a doctor.

21
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,623
Not the sharpest nail in the box.

22
00:01:07,793 --> 00:01:10,118
Just give him a chance. You'll see.

23
00:01:12,214 --> 00:01:14,965
Okay, kid. Let's talk. Alone.

24
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,801
All right, look. Listen, listen.
I gotta get back down to the ER.

25
00:01:18,969 --> 00:01:21,460
Make sure you tell him
that you work real hard, okay?

26
00:01:21,638 --> 00:01:23,097
- Okay, G.
- I'll see you at home.

27
00:01:23,265 --> 00:01:25,174
- All right.
- All right.

28
00:01:26,434 --> 00:01:28,640
I work real hard.

29
00:01:35,567 --> 00:01:37,145
I don't want to be here.

30
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:39,027
Sand truck rolled on I-40.
Three DOAs.

31
00:01:39,196 --> 00:01:41,484
Jessie Callahan,
35-year-old restrained passenger.

32
00:01:41,656 --> 00:01:46,109
High-speed T-bone, BP 122/78.
Pulse 93, bloody scalp lac, she got a liter.

33
00:01:46,202 --> 00:01:48,159
- Okay. Trauma 1.
- Tom? Where's Tom?

34
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:51,828
- Jessie, can you tell me where it hurts?
- I left Tom. I left him all alone.

35
00:01:51,999 --> 00:01:54,157
Her husband's still in the car.
Fire department's cutting him out.

36
00:01:54,334 --> 00:01:57,785
Paramedics are working on
your husband. Gonna let us help you?

37
00:01:57,962 --> 00:01:59,622
So just Neosporin on the abrasion?

38
00:01:59,797 --> 00:02:03,213
And tell him to stop for a while
or he's literally going to jerk it off.

39
00:02:03,384 --> 00:02:05,791
- Lewis. Paramedics pulling in with a fall.
- Okay.

40
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:09,634
Jerry, call the morons in Engineering
and tell them to get down here.

41
00:02:09,806 --> 00:02:12,131
We�re okay. Nobody panic.
Nobody panic.

42
00:02:12,308 --> 00:02:15,013
And call Psych.
The sun goes down, the nuts come out.

43
00:02:15,186 --> 00:02:16,430
Are we ready for him?

44
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:18,347
- Who?
- The alderman.

45
00:02:18,522 --> 00:02:22,851
- Have you been drinking, alderman?
- Hey, back up. You can't come in here.

46
00:02:23,026 --> 00:02:24,686
All right, keep them back.

47
00:02:24,861 --> 00:02:28,027
- John Bright, 55, 8-foot fall off a stage.
- It was a dais.

48
00:02:28,197 --> 00:02:33,535
BP 124/82, pulse 79. No LOC. Complains
of neck, hip and right knee pain.

49
00:02:33,702 --> 00:02:36,619
Alderman, it's an honor to have you here.
I'm Dr. Kerry Weaver.

50
00:02:36,788 --> 00:02:40,239
- Are you taking any medications, sir?
- No. And call me John.

51
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:45,122
Gently, people. CBC, chem panel,
type and hold, UA.

52
00:02:45,295 --> 00:02:47,751
- Chest is clear.
- Chest is clear.

53
00:02:47,923 --> 00:02:52,299
All right. Pupils 4 mm and reactive.

54
00:02:52,468 --> 00:02:54,260
- Who you on the phone with?
- The office.

55
00:02:54,428 --> 00:02:56,836
She's my assistant.
Jennifer, honey, try to breathe.

56
00:02:57,014 --> 00:03:01,307
- Shut that cell phone off in here.
- You can use our phones. Just dial nine.

57
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,311
- Have you been drinking?
- You don't have to answer that.

58
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:07,764
No, I haven't. I'm on the program.
Just got my two-year chip.

59
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,857
Okay, then. Open wide
and stick out your tongue.

60
00:03:11,026 --> 00:03:16,067
Okay. Don't worry, sir.
You�re in the finest hospital in Chicago.

61
00:03:19,576 --> 00:03:20,607
Okay.

62
00:04:11,705 --> 00:04:14,741
The emergency power
will kick on any second.

63
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,952
- Let there be light.
- Shooting.

64
00:04:18,127 --> 00:04:21,827
Thank God something's working.
Get that into Exam 2. Move it.

65
00:04:22,006 --> 00:04:25,789
We�re gonna take a scan of your belly to
make sure you�re not bleeding internally.

66
00:04:25,967 --> 00:04:27,675
- Is Tom here yet?
- We'll find out.

67
00:04:27,844 --> 00:04:31,094
Come on. Get the lead out.
We got a VIP customer waiting.

68
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:42,311
- Leon, what are you doing? I work here.
- Me too, G. I got the job.

69
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,474
- Okay, good. That's great.
- It's cool, man.

70
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,809
Hey. Hey, this is Dr. Weaver in ER.

71
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:51,647
Get your fat union asses
down here and fix the power.

72
00:04:51,907 --> 00:04:53,733
Got the job.
We're gonna work together.

73
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:56,695
Pratt, hey, kiss your friend goodbye
and get back to work.

74
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,984
Hello.

75
00:04:59,247 --> 00:05:01,572
- Damn it. Hello?
- It's good. It's gonna work out-

76
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:03,326
Does anyone have a carrier pigeon?

77
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,745
- Good.
- I get the overtime-

78
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:06,496
- Leon. How's it going?
- I got a job.

79
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,045
Glad to hear it. She's stable.

80
00:05:08,213 --> 00:05:10,585
But check another HemoCue
before you send her to CT.

81
00:05:10,757 --> 00:05:12,215
- She may need some blood.
- Okay.

82
00:05:12,383 --> 00:05:14,755
You got nothing to worry about.
This is cool.

83
00:05:14,927 --> 00:05:17,844
After I get off, we'll go to Mario's,
get pizza and celebrate.

84
00:05:18,013 --> 00:05:20,586
No, G. I'm working tonight
on the late shift.

85
00:05:20,766 --> 00:05:23,303
- Tonight?
- I get my own uniform. Isn't that cool?

86
00:05:23,476 --> 00:05:26,927
- And you know where to pick it up?
- I got the address. They wrote it down.

87
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,437
- I can find it by myself.
- All right, good.

88
00:05:29,607 --> 00:05:31,813
- Congratulations.
- Stop worrying, man.

89
00:05:31,984 --> 00:05:33,775
We�re gonna be
working together, man.

90
00:05:33,944 --> 00:05:36,020
We�re gonna be working together.

91
00:05:36,196 --> 00:05:38,769
- All right, G. I'll see you later, man.
- All right.

92
00:05:38,948 --> 00:05:41,154
Work on a press release and fax it over.

93
00:05:41,242 --> 00:05:42,653
Somebody get me a fax number.

94
00:05:42,827 --> 00:05:46,076
All right. Engineering is
coming down now to work on the power.

95
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:47,621
How are you feeling, alderman?

96
00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:51,039
Pampered. I'm sure you have
other patients.

97
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:53,616
This ER sees about 90,000 a year,
doesn't it?

98
00:05:53,795 --> 00:05:56,629
- That's why I'm tired all the time.
- More like 110,000.

99
00:05:56,797 --> 00:05:58,624
It's a damn miracle
what you people do.

100
00:05:58,799 --> 00:06:02,168
We have a great team. But we could
do more if we had better resources.

101
00:06:02,344 --> 00:06:04,301
No medial or lateral instability.

102
00:06:04,888 --> 00:06:06,880
You probably tore
a ligament when you fell.

103
00:06:07,056 --> 00:06:10,010
There goes my dream
of being an Olympic gymnast.

104
00:06:10,184 --> 00:06:13,434
I'll page Dr. Hullverson.
He's our top orthopedist, excellent.

105
00:06:13,604 --> 00:06:17,138
- Give the alderman six of morphine.
- We should see a tox screen first.

106
00:06:17,566 --> 00:06:19,522
What? Who are you?

107
00:06:19,818 --> 00:06:22,273
- Was it cocaine, alderman?
- Oh, my God. Get out.

108
00:06:22,445 --> 00:06:24,817
Ray MacGee, Chicago Times.
I have a right to be here.

109
00:06:24,989 --> 00:06:27,479
Listen, hey. Leave this man alone.
This is a hospital.

110
00:06:27,658 --> 00:06:31,987
- You ever heard of the First Amendment?
- Ever heard of an awake colonoscopy?

111
00:06:32,162 --> 00:06:34,831
Wherever you stole that scrub top from,
I want it back.

112
00:06:34,998 --> 00:06:37,156
Jerry, can you try and keep out
the fake nurses?

113
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,613
So many rules to remember.

114
00:06:38,793 --> 00:06:40,999
- Fake nurses?
- Don't ask.

115
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:44,289
Don't we have enough trouble
with the real ones?

116
00:06:44,506 --> 00:06:46,582
- Looks busy.
- Lucky you.

117
00:06:46,758 --> 00:06:48,382
I hate nights.

118
00:06:48,551 --> 00:06:49,962
MVA coming in, two minutes.

119
00:06:50,136 --> 00:06:52,805
- Is that from the I-40 pileup?
- That lady's husband.

120
00:06:52,972 --> 00:06:54,798
I'm off. Can you make sure
somebody finds her if it is?

121
00:06:54,973 --> 00:06:56,218
- Sure.
- Good.

122
00:06:56,391 --> 00:06:57,969
Hot date?

123
00:06:58,143 --> 00:07:03,100
No. I gotta give a check
at this symphony fundraiser thing.

124
00:07:03,272 --> 00:07:05,312
Lifestyles of the rich
and famous, baby.

125
00:07:05,483 --> 00:07:08,187
- Look what the patient fairy brought you.
- No.

126
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,440
Mrs. Hawkes, 44, fever,
cough times three days.

127
00:07:12,614 --> 00:07:15,817
- I'm juggling 10 patients already.
- I'm just waiting for a chest film.

128
00:07:15,992 --> 00:07:19,692
If it comes back clear, just write her
a little scrip, send her home. Easy dispo.

129
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,705
Okay. Probably just the flu.
Give it to Pratt. He'll hate it.

130
00:07:22,873 --> 00:07:24,700
- Done.
- Ten minutes.

131
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,784
You two have fun.

132
00:07:27,252 --> 00:07:30,620
- So you sure you wanna go?
- Definitely. Free canap�s.

133
00:07:30,797 --> 00:07:33,418
What is a canap� anyway?

134
00:07:33,758 --> 00:07:38,004
- Don't worry. I'll use the right fork.
- Next time we'll do something fun.

135
00:07:38,178 --> 00:07:40,716
Next time we'll do something
that you wanna do.

136
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:43,843
Oh, you mean like miniature golf
or bowling?

137
00:07:44,017 --> 00:07:45,724
Things my people enjoy doing?

138
00:07:45,893 --> 00:07:48,218
- It's too bad Cats closed.
- I'll just shut up now.

139
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,056
- That's sexual harassment, isn't it?
- You bet.

140
00:07:52,232 --> 00:07:53,430
I'll circulate a petition.

141
00:07:53,608 --> 00:07:56,064
- Excuse me. Dr. Carter, right?
- Yeah.

142
00:07:56,236 --> 00:07:59,236
I'm Sarah Wilson. I work with Dr. Mac.

143
00:07:59,405 --> 00:08:01,730
You called the clinic,
said he needed to come back.

144
00:08:01,907 --> 00:08:04,196
Oh, yeah. He left before
his chem panel came back.

145
00:08:04,368 --> 00:08:07,986
Oh, he's dizzy. He's dehydrated.
And I'm worried about his diabetes.

146
00:08:08,163 --> 00:08:10,286
Yeah. Well, he really needs
to come in.

147
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:13,243
There are always patients at the clinic.
He won't leave them.

148
00:08:13,418 --> 00:08:15,410
And what, there's nobody
to cover for him?

149
00:08:15,586 --> 00:08:18,871
- A one-man show, seven days a week.
- Dr. Carter.

150
00:08:19,047 --> 00:08:21,882
Another one from the pileup.
Pulse 110, 20-minute extrication.

151
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,592
Take a deep breath, Mr. Callahan.

152
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,511
- My wife, Jessie-?
- Mr. Callahan. She's here. She's stable.

153
00:08:26,679 --> 00:08:28,885
We'll let someone know
you' re looking for her.

154
00:08:29,056 --> 00:08:31,594
I need you to come down to the clinic
and talk to him.

155
00:08:31,767 --> 00:08:34,851
- What makes you think he's gonna listen?
- Well, he likes you.

156
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:39,598
- Sure had a good way of hiding it.
- He's going to kill himself.

157
00:08:39,774 --> 00:08:43,606
He won't listen to me.
Stop by, please.

158
00:08:43,778 --> 00:08:44,975
- Carter.
- Just for a minute.

159
00:08:45,154 --> 00:08:47,312
Calling for anesthesiology backup
in Scanner 2.

160
00:08:47,489 --> 00:08:48,604
That's Pratt's patient.

161
00:08:48,782 --> 00:08:50,774
Jessie Callahan. She crashed
on the CT table.

162
00:08:50,951 --> 00:08:52,860
- Excuse me.
- Will you come?

163
00:08:53,036 --> 00:08:55,408
If you leave the address at the desk,
I'll try.

164
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,616
She might not make it down.
Prep the rapid infuser in Trauma 1.

165
00:09:05,797 --> 00:09:08,370
Pneumonia.
Her right lobe's completely socked in.

166
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:10,791
So much for an easy dispo.
Did you run labs?

167
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:13,423
White count is 27,000 with a left shift.

168
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:15,172
Gram-negative rods in the sputum.

169
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:17,090
Call ICU.

170
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,424
It's got to be klebsiella
or pseudomonas, right?

171
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:22,138
Yeah. Not good.

172
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,971
Sats are only 85 on two liters.

173
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,973
Crank her to five liters, nasal cannula.

174
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:29,980
Get a gram of cefotaxime, IV,
and 500 of Biaxin.

175
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,067
This is Dr. Lewis.

176
00:09:33,947 --> 00:09:35,275
I've never had flu this bad.

177
00:09:35,448 --> 00:09:37,903
She's coughing a lot.
Do you guys have cough medicine?

178
00:09:38,075 --> 00:09:40,531
We' re giving her all the medicine
we can right now.

179
00:09:40,703 --> 00:09:43,110
I need to talk to your mom
for a minute, okay?

180
00:09:43,288 --> 00:09:45,660
Hey, you guys want a soda?

181
00:09:45,832 --> 00:09:47,659
Go on.

182
00:09:51,921 --> 00:09:54,494
- Is our mom really sick?
- Well, she has pneumonia.

183
00:09:54,673 --> 00:09:58,338
It's a serious disease,
but we' re doing everything that we can.

184
00:09:59,678 --> 00:10:03,011
- We should call Doug-
- No. Mom would freak.

185
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:05,265
Call who?

186
00:10:05,433 --> 00:10:07,472
Doug. He's our brother.

187
00:10:07,643 --> 00:10:10,181
- Does he live with you?
- No. He's 20.

188
00:10:10,354 --> 00:10:12,346
He has like 50 earrings.

189
00:10:12,522 --> 00:10:16,769
I just need some sleep. Marten never
should have called 911.

190
00:10:16,943 --> 00:10:20,193
Well, I'm glad he did. This type of
pneumonia's very dangerous.

191
00:10:20,363 --> 00:10:23,114
My kids have homework.
They need dinner.

192
00:10:23,282 --> 00:10:26,781
Mrs. Hawkes, you' re too sick
to leave the hospital.

193
00:10:26,952 --> 00:10:29,988
Write me a prescription.
I want to get it filled on the way home.

194
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:33,911
If we take you off the medicine,
you will probably die.

195
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:38,371
Is there anyone we can call?
A relative to be here with you?

196
00:10:38,545 --> 00:10:42,044
- Someone to watch your kids?
- My husband died last year.

197
00:10:44,842 --> 00:10:46,669
My Aunt Sara.

198
00:10:47,053 --> 00:10:48,547
She lives in Detroit.

199
00:10:49,346 --> 00:10:50,722
And what about your son Doug?

200
00:10:51,223 --> 00:10:54,757
No. I don't want him here.
I don't want him near my kids.

201
00:10:54,935 --> 00:10:56,761
Is there anyone else
nearby we can call?

202
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:01,139
No. I'll call Sara. She'll come.

203
00:11:02,024 --> 00:11:06,068
Pratt, Carter needs you now.
Your MVA, she crashed in CT.

204
00:11:06,236 --> 00:11:08,394
Charge to 360.

205
00:11:08,738 --> 00:11:10,565
All right, clear.

206
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,065
- Still in V-fib.
- Another mg of epi, charge to 360.

207
00:11:13,242 --> 00:11:15,698
- What happened?
- Shut up and bag. The second HemoCue?

208
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,245
- Did you check it?
- Yes, I did.

209
00:11:17,413 --> 00:11:20,082
- Coarse V-fib.
- All right and clear.

210
00:11:20,749 --> 00:11:22,457
Let's go.

211
00:11:24,294 --> 00:11:25,918
Sats dropping to 91.

212
00:11:26,087 --> 00:11:29,752
- Push the lido. Ten blade. Say it.
- Ten blade.

213
00:11:29,924 --> 00:11:32,415
- Can you find my wife?
- We will, Mr. Callahan.

214
00:11:32,593 --> 00:11:34,669
Right down to the rib.
Curved Pean clamp next.

215
00:11:34,845 --> 00:11:37,632
- Pressure's falling, down to 80.
- Keep the elbow up.

216
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:41,509
Push harder. Lean with your hip.

217
00:11:41,684 --> 00:11:46,144
Okay, tension pneumo. Line's in.
Let's hook up two units of O-neg.

218
00:11:46,313 --> 00:11:48,187
Okay, pressure's coming up.

219
00:11:50,025 --> 00:11:51,270
Nice work.

220
00:11:51,651 --> 00:11:54,854
Malik, hook up the Thora-Seal.
0 silk on a driver and Vaseline gauze.

221
00:11:55,029 --> 00:11:57,698
- What do you have?
- Tension pneumo, intraperitoneal blood.

222
00:11:57,865 --> 00:11:59,656
Ex-lap. Don't even bother to scan him.

223
00:11:59,825 --> 00:12:02,280
Come on upstairs, sir,
where the good drugs are.

224
00:12:02,452 --> 00:12:06,117
Mr. Callahan, you are bleeding in
your belly. You need an operation.

225
00:12:06,289 --> 00:12:08,531
Is that Jessie?

226
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:13,204
The other doctor is taking care of her.
But we need to take you up to surgery.

227
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:18,289
I just want to see her.
I need to know she's all right.

228
00:12:20,135 --> 00:12:22,044
One minute, okay?

229
00:12:23,221 --> 00:12:24,549
No pressure.

230
00:12:24,722 --> 00:12:28,221
She should never have left.
Got a huge retroperitoneal bleed.

231
00:12:28,392 --> 00:12:29,672
- Carter?
- Not now, Luka.

232
00:12:29,852 --> 00:12:31,974
- Mag and bicarb are in, round four.
- Jessie.

233
00:12:32,312 --> 00:12:33,510
Can you close that door?

234
00:12:34,397 --> 00:12:37,481
- V-fib. Shock again?
- Yeah. Charge 360, stat.

235
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:40,651
- Charged.
- All right. Everybody, clear.

236
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:46,319
- Looks like sinus.
- No pulse. It's P. E.A.

237
00:12:46,992 --> 00:12:50,574
- How long?
- Ten minutes. She's brain dead.

238
00:12:50,745 --> 00:12:52,654
Her heart's barely beating.

239
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:58,661
He wants to see her
before we take him up to the O.R.

240
00:12:58,835 --> 00:13:00,828
- Shall I bring him in?
- Yeah.

241
00:13:02,255 --> 00:13:05,042
- I'll tell him.
- Thanks.

242
00:13:06,634 --> 00:13:09,089
All right, everybody.
See you tomorrow.

243
00:13:39,037 --> 00:13:42,620
Hey, Jerry, can you call Housekeeping?
Pizza kid with braces puked again in 3.

244
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:45,957
- Sure. Nacho?
- Oh, thanks. Cheesy.

245
00:13:46,127 --> 00:13:50,041
- Jerry, where's our alderman?
- I think he's still up in X-ray.

246
00:13:50,214 --> 00:13:53,214
Damn it. I asked them to put a rush on it.
Get them on the phone.

247
00:13:53,508 --> 00:13:55,797
Kerry, we need to discuss
our alderman.

248
00:13:55,969 --> 00:14:00,097
Did you know he's the one who wrote the
bill to finance the spousal abuse shelter?

249
00:14:00,264 --> 00:14:02,553
- He's one of the good guys.
- Not too good.

250
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:07,471
When we were checking for pelvic
fractures, I found a sore on his penis.

251
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:08,974
I think it's syphilis.

252
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:13,400
- Did you swab it?
- Yeah. We' re waiting on labs.

253
00:14:13,568 --> 00:14:16,604
They just finished with the alderman.
They' re bringing him down.

254
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:19,898
- Thanks, Jerry.
- How should I handle it if he's positive?

255
00:14:20,741 --> 00:14:23,410
You won't have to. I will.

256
00:14:25,245 --> 00:14:27,570
Her heart's still beating.

257
00:14:28,706 --> 00:14:31,113
Her pupils are dilated.

258
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:35,083
That means her brain
was deprived of oxygen for too long.

259
00:14:35,754 --> 00:14:38,245
Maybe she'll wake up.

260
00:14:39,924 --> 00:14:41,715
No, she won't.

261
00:14:45,888 --> 00:14:50,384
Mr. Callahan,
your bleeding is getting worse.

262
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:53,228
We have to take you up to the O. R.

263
00:14:54,187 --> 00:14:56,678
We wanted a family.

264
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,767
We couldn't.

265
00:15:00,818 --> 00:15:02,609
I couldn't.

266
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:07,063
She didn't like talking about
donors or anything.

267
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,284
She's gone.
You're putting yourself in danger.

268
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:16,741
I can't just leave her here to die alone.

269
00:15:28,133 --> 00:15:30,624
Okay, I got a vascular surgeon,
an anesthesiologist...

270
00:15:30,802 --> 00:15:34,171
...and three surgical residents in
an O. R. suite that rents $5000 an hour.

271
00:15:34,347 --> 00:15:36,505
- He wants to be with his wife.
- That's touching.

272
00:15:36,683 --> 00:15:39,553
- She's dying.
- If she doesn't die faster, he'll die.

273
00:15:40,144 --> 00:15:42,136
- I explained all that.
- I'm going upstairs.

274
00:15:42,313 --> 00:15:45,349
If he's not up there in 10 minutes,
I'm gonna take out your spleen.

275
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,308
We're the richest country in the world...

276
00:15:48,485 --> 00:15:51,355
...and we can't provide
basic health services for our citizens.

277
00:15:51,529 --> 00:15:53,071
Yes. Not just emergency care.

278
00:15:53,239 --> 00:15:55,812
Prenatal screening,
drug and alcohol treatment.

279
00:15:55,991 --> 00:15:58,067
We do what we can
with limited resources...

280
00:15:58,243 --> 00:16:00,366
Everybody at City Hall
should come down here...

281
00:16:00,537 --> 00:16:02,695
...and see what kind of war
you fight every day.

282
00:16:02,872 --> 00:16:04,995
You've been fighting
some big wars yourself.

283
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:07,289
Don't tell me we can't find him
a private room.

284
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,119
Nice to see you again.
Robert Romano.

285
00:16:09,295 --> 00:16:11,702
Heard you were here.
Getting all the care you need?

286
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,715
- We' re waiting on a few tests.
- I don't want a private room.

287
00:16:14,883 --> 00:16:18,501
Lets me experience the kind of service
my constituents get when they come in.

288
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:20,469
You' re in good hands
with Dr. Weaver.

289
00:16:20,638 --> 00:16:23,722
But if you need anything at all,
hope you'll give me a call.

290
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,845
Find him a room.

291
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:28,591
I was on the committee
that hired that man.

292
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:32,139
- Oh, he's an excellent surgeon.
- Tragic about his arm.

293
00:16:32,315 --> 00:16:35,565
Lots of people downtown
wish it had been his head.

294
00:16:35,943 --> 00:16:39,477
You haven't broken your knee.
Looks like you have blood in the joint.

295
00:16:39,655 --> 00:16:42,858
- Is that serious?
- No. You'll feel better once we drain it.

296
00:16:43,033 --> 00:16:44,859
That sounds unpleasant.

297
00:16:45,451 --> 00:16:47,942
It sounds worse than it is.

298
00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:53,372
- Could you give us a minute?
- Oh, sure. Espresso's calling.

299
00:16:53,542 --> 00:16:56,033
Girl lives on caffeine and chocolate.

300
00:16:56,211 --> 00:16:58,084
Alderman...

301
00:16:58,797 --> 00:17:02,960
...when Dr. Lewis examined you,
she found a sore.

302
00:17:03,134 --> 00:17:05,375
Yeah. Is it what I think it is?

303
00:17:06,095 --> 00:17:09,380
- We' re still waiting for the lab results.
- But you have some idea.

304
00:17:10,182 --> 00:17:11,592
It's probably syphilis.

305
00:17:15,061 --> 00:17:17,896
That wasn't the diagnosis
I was hoping for.

306
00:17:18,063 --> 00:17:21,230
- How many partners this year?
- Only one.

307
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,353
Okay. We'll give you a shot
of antibiotics and you'll be fine.

308
00:17:24,528 --> 00:17:25,559
Good.

309
00:17:25,737 --> 00:17:28,144
But we'll need to report it
to the Health Department.

310
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:32,320
Any way we can keep it
out of my medical record?

311
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:35,656
It's automatic once the labs are done.

312
00:17:35,829 --> 00:17:38,616
But there's no need to worry,
your records are confidential.

313
00:17:38,832 --> 00:17:40,705
No, your health records
are confidential.

314
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:43,413
Every time there's an election,
I have to release mine.

315
00:17:43,586 --> 00:17:46,836
And syphilis is not a word
the voters love to hear.

316
00:17:47,464 --> 00:17:51,675
- I understand your concerns.
- We'll both get treatment.

317
00:17:51,843 --> 00:17:54,844
You don't think everyone
deserves some privacy?

318
00:17:57,181 --> 00:18:02,056
- Her sats are still falling, down to 83.
- Okay. Call Lewis and put her on a mask.

319
00:18:02,269 --> 00:18:04,558
- Doug.
- Hey, monkeys.

320
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:07,434
- You came.
- You making trouble?

321
00:18:07,607 --> 00:18:11,272
- Nice to see you.
- Hey, I'm Dr. Pratt. You must be Doug.

322
00:18:11,444 --> 00:18:14,444
Yeah. Hey.

323
00:18:20,118 --> 00:18:21,281
Hey.

324
00:18:21,453 --> 00:18:24,323
- What's he doing here?
- He was worried about you.

325
00:18:24,497 --> 00:18:27,284
He doesn't worry about
anyone but himself.

326
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:29,833
Good to see you too, Mom.

327
00:18:30,002 --> 00:18:31,626
- Did you find Lewis?
- She's coming.

328
00:18:31,795 --> 00:18:34,120
I told you not to call him.

329
00:18:34,631 --> 00:18:38,545
I don't want you near my kids, Doug.
Make him leave.

330
00:18:39,969 --> 00:18:43,717
- What's up?
- Her sats are down to 83.

331
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:48,634
- Doug, you' re high, aren't you?
- No.

332
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:50,352
Get the hell out of here.

333
00:18:50,937 --> 00:18:52,431
- Who's he?
- Her son.

334
00:18:52,605 --> 00:18:54,644
Mom, please. Let Doug stay.

335
00:18:54,815 --> 00:18:57,187
So you can sit around
and watch him get stoned?

336
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:00,313
Come on. They live with you,
watch you sit around and get drunk.

337
00:19:00,487 --> 00:19:02,729
Get the hell out of here. Get out.

338
00:19:04,866 --> 00:19:06,823
Take slow breaths.

339
00:19:08,327 --> 00:19:10,485
- Oh, God.
- Mom?

340
00:19:10,663 --> 00:19:13,034
- Sats are down to 78.
- Up the 0-2. Get them out.

341
00:19:13,206 --> 00:19:16,741
- Come on. Come on.
- She's not moving any air.

342
00:19:16,918 --> 00:19:20,168
Bag her. Get 20 of etomidate,
100 of sux, set up for an intubation.

343
00:19:20,671 --> 00:19:21,834
You called him?

344
00:19:22,006 --> 00:19:24,082
Aunt's in Detroit. He's here.
I tried to help.

345
00:19:24,258 --> 00:19:28,207
You can help by learning to listen when
the patient asks you not to do something.

346
00:19:29,763 --> 00:19:33,012
Jerry, Dr. Lewis mislabeled a swab.

347
00:19:33,182 --> 00:19:35,175
Can we pull it from the lab tray?

348
00:19:35,351 --> 00:19:37,723
Labs went out an hour ago.

349
00:19:39,021 --> 00:19:42,935
I need you to call and cancel it.
It's under Bright.

350
00:19:43,108 --> 00:19:44,851
- The alderman?
- Yeah.

351
00:19:45,026 --> 00:19:46,853
I can try.

352
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:53,115
She's oxygenating well. Turn her down to
80 percent and check gas in half an hour.

353
00:19:53,283 --> 00:19:56,154
- ICU is full.
- Call again. She needs a bed.

354
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:59,115
Listen, sorry about that.
I was trying to do the right thing.

355
00:19:59,289 --> 00:20:02,788
You exacerbated a terrible situation.
I told you to call the aunt.

356
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:06,125
I did. She's 69 with MS.
She can't take care of those kids.

357
00:20:06,295 --> 00:20:09,212
Well, you think stoner boy's
gonna do any better?

358
00:20:09,381 --> 00:20:10,958
Doug?

359
00:20:12,384 --> 00:20:15,301
Okay, guys.
I gotta talk to the doctors, all right?

360
00:20:20,391 --> 00:20:22,050
You okay?

361
00:20:23,018 --> 00:20:28,557
Yeah, I smoked a little this afternoon,
you know, but I'm fine now, so...

362
00:20:29,732 --> 00:20:32,353
- Hey, did I kill her?
- No.

363
00:20:32,526 --> 00:20:35,646
We had to put a tube in her throat
to help her breathe.

364
00:20:35,821 --> 00:20:40,648
- Why did she cough up all that blood?
- She has an infection in her lungs.

365
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:46,945
Hey, look, I'm sorry I said all that stuff.

366
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:50,906
It's just- God, she just gets to me.

367
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:53,627
Your mom's in stable condition...

368
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:56,914
...but she's gonna have to be
in ICU for at least a week.

369
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:02,300
Rachel and Marten need a place to stay.
Tonight, at least.

370
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:05,379
Yeah, I guess.

371
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:10,099
It doesn't look like your mom's aunt
will be able to help out.

372
00:21:10,268 --> 00:21:12,556
Who? Aunt Sara?

373
00:21:12,728 --> 00:21:14,768
She can't even feed herself.

374
00:21:16,857 --> 00:21:19,526
Is there anyone else
who can take care of those kids?

375
00:21:21,361 --> 00:21:22,938
No.

376
00:21:23,363 --> 00:21:25,438
There's nobody.

377
00:21:29,451 --> 00:21:31,491
Packed cells are in.

378
00:21:31,912 --> 00:21:34,829
Tom, listen to me.
You have to go to the O. R.

379
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:39,248
I won't leave her.

380
00:21:40,127 --> 00:21:44,623
- You could die too if you don't.
- She's not dead.

381
00:21:54,015 --> 00:21:57,348
Malik, can you see
if the next two units are ready?

382
00:21:57,518 --> 00:21:59,594
Yeah.

383
00:22:00,854 --> 00:22:05,397
Remember when we went up
to Lake Louise biking that summer?

384
00:22:10,488 --> 00:22:12,029
Is that it?

385
00:22:13,323 --> 00:22:14,983
Yes.

386
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:22,247
She's gone.

387
00:22:25,084 --> 00:22:29,211
Time of death: 1934.

388
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:41,504
- Mr. Callahan?
- Thank you for letting me be with her.

389
00:22:43,475 --> 00:22:45,716
Okay, let's move him.

390
00:22:49,647 --> 00:22:53,016
I'll call Surgery and catch up to you
at the elevators, Malik.

391
00:22:53,192 --> 00:22:54,852
You got it.

392
00:23:18,422 --> 00:23:20,960
Labs came back on your alderman.
Positive for syphilis.

393
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:23,209
I asked to pull the swab.
It was mislabeled.

394
00:23:23,385 --> 00:23:26,635
You want labs, can't get them.
You don't want them, they get efficient.

395
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:29,342
Chuny, I need a repeat potassium
on Mrs. Callahan.

396
00:23:29,515 --> 00:23:31,591
- I'll get it.
- What is she still doing here?

397
00:23:31,767 --> 00:23:34,222
- She's an MVA.
- Kovac pronounced her an hour ago.

398
00:23:34,395 --> 00:23:37,348
She's in and out of V-tach.
But she's got a pulse.

399
00:23:39,149 --> 00:23:42,600
Jerry, I thought I asked you
to pull the alderman's labs.

400
00:23:42,777 --> 00:23:46,276
- I called them. I'll call them again.
- It's all right. I'll take care of it.

401
00:23:46,447 --> 00:23:48,689
Paramedics are pulling up
with a kid. Took a fall.

402
00:23:48,866 --> 00:23:49,980
Don't they call ahead anymore?

403
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,492
Jerry, make sure those TV news vans
are out of the ambulance bay.

404
00:23:53,662 --> 00:23:54,990
Hey, Luka.

405
00:23:55,163 --> 00:23:57,654
Why is Jessie Callahan still in Trauma 1?

406
00:23:57,749 --> 00:24:00,074
Because she died an hour ago.

407
00:24:00,251 --> 00:24:02,658
Her husband wouldn't go
to the O. R. until she passed.

408
00:24:02,836 --> 00:24:04,793
So I unhooked her leads
and pronounced her.

409
00:24:04,963 --> 00:24:06,161
Good God.

410
00:24:06,339 --> 00:24:09,874
What happens when he gets back from
surgery and finds out his wife is alive?

411
00:24:10,051 --> 00:24:12,921
- I'll tell him it was a miracle.
- We need a doctor over here.

412
00:24:14,138 --> 00:24:17,922
This isn't funny, Luka. You unhooked the
monitors of a critically injured woman.

413
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,176
Hardly in the best interest
of your patient.

414
00:24:20,352 --> 00:24:21,976
She wasn't my patient, he was.

415
00:24:22,145 --> 00:24:25,810
David Scott, 9 years old. Altered after
a fall from the top bunk of a bunk bed.

416
00:24:25,982 --> 00:24:28,389
Neighbor was babysitting,
heard a crash, called 911.

417
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:30,560
GCS 235.

418
00:24:34,364 --> 00:24:36,522
- The real one will be bigger.
- I hope so.

419
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,866
- Quiche?
- Thank you.

420
00:24:40,036 --> 00:24:41,281
Have you tried these?

421
00:24:41,454 --> 00:24:45,747
- They' re like perfect little salty things.
- Don't fill up on those.

422
00:24:45,916 --> 00:24:48,952
With any luck, we may get out
early enough to get some real food.

423
00:24:49,127 --> 00:24:51,499
- How much are they trying to raise?
- Fifty-eight, I think.

424
00:24:51,588 --> 00:24:52,998
We' re throwing in 10.

425
00:24:53,172 --> 00:24:55,414
- Thousand?
- Million.

426
00:24:55,633 --> 00:24:57,210
Right.

427
00:24:57,927 --> 00:25:00,298
So I guess that means
you get great seats forever?

428
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,964
Gamma will.

429
00:25:02,139 --> 00:25:03,763
What do you do with $58 million?

430
00:25:03,932 --> 00:25:05,592
You get architectural significance.

431
00:25:05,767 --> 00:25:08,055
What's the point of building a
cultural edifice...

432
00:25:08,227 --> 00:25:10,599
...if you' re not gonna prove
your civic superiority?

433
00:25:10,771 --> 00:25:12,645
Well, that's a lot of civic superiority.

434
00:25:12,815 --> 00:25:14,522
McNulty's clinic's
not far from here.

435
00:25:14,691 --> 00:25:16,767
What do you think he'd do
with $58 million?

436
00:25:16,943 --> 00:25:19,897
- Hot hors d'oeuvres in his waiting room?
- Hello, John.

437
00:25:20,071 --> 00:25:21,898
Hello, Gamma.

438
00:25:22,073 --> 00:25:24,610
- Hi, Steve.
- John.

439
00:25:24,784 --> 00:25:27,191
I'm Millicent Carter, John's grandmother.

440
00:25:27,369 --> 00:25:30,654
- Hi. Abby Lockhart.
- Gamma, you've met Abby before.

441
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:35,706
Oh, I'm sorry.
So many people in John's life.

442
00:25:35,877 --> 00:25:37,750
Don't you look beautiful.

443
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,628
What exactly are canap�s?

444
00:25:41,215 --> 00:25:44,500
I mean, are they different
from appetizers?

445
00:25:45,093 --> 00:25:46,753
I'm not sure, dear.

446
00:25:48,137 --> 00:25:50,924
There's a foundation board meeting
on Thursday, John.

447
00:25:51,098 --> 00:25:52,889
- Can you come?
- No. Thank you.

448
00:25:53,517 --> 00:25:56,518
I'd appreciate it.
We' re electing new officers.

449
00:25:56,687 --> 00:25:58,430
Oh, well...

450
00:25:58,605 --> 00:26:02,649
I thought that was a whoever's-in-
the-bathroom-is-president kind of thing.

451
00:26:02,817 --> 00:26:07,110
I'm stepping down. I'd like you
to take your father's place as treasurer.

452
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,904
How did Dad get off so easy?

453
00:26:09,573 --> 00:26:13,155
I've asked your father
to take my place as president.

454
00:26:14,411 --> 00:26:17,080
Don't you think you' re getting
a bit long in the tooth...

455
00:26:17,246 --> 00:26:20,615
...for the disaffected youth role, John?

456
00:26:21,583 --> 00:26:25,960
Gamma, thank you. But, no, thank you.
I already have a day job.

457
00:26:31,968 --> 00:26:35,716
- David, can you open your eyes?
- Looks like a Colles' fracture.

458
00:26:35,888 --> 00:26:39,636
- I'm assessing his mental status.
- He responds to painful stimuli.

459
00:26:39,808 --> 00:26:42,299
- David, do you know where you are?
- I don't know.

460
00:26:42,477 --> 00:26:45,596
- All right. Let's get a head CT.
- Lots of old bruises.

461
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:49,017
- Active kid. Hockey, maybe?
- We should do a long-bone survey.

462
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:53,319
- We have to rule out intracranial bleed.
- You guys seen Pratt?

463
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:55,313
Mrs. Callahan's potassium's 3. 2.

464
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:58,359
- Okay. Add 20 of KCL to her next liter.
- She's a DNR.

465
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:01,367
And if she arrests we'll let her go,
until then we treat her.

466
00:27:01,535 --> 00:27:03,611
She's dead, Kerry.

467
00:27:04,788 --> 00:27:06,282
Oh, great. Just what I need.

468
00:27:06,998 --> 00:27:09,999
- This is a decision for her husband.
- He's had surgery.

469
00:27:10,168 --> 00:27:11,579
If you'd told him the truth...

470
00:27:11,753 --> 00:27:14,504
...he could have given us
instructions on his wife's care.

471
00:27:14,672 --> 00:27:16,082
Now we have to decide.

472
00:27:16,257 --> 00:27:18,249
Give her the K.

473
00:27:21,303 --> 00:27:22,417
What can I do for you?

474
00:27:22,596 --> 00:27:25,382
I'm finished for the day
and I come down to say good night...

475
00:27:25,556 --> 00:27:28,592
...and who should I find still
sitting in the middle of the ER?

476
00:27:28,768 --> 00:27:32,219
- We' re waiting on tests for the alderman.
- Alderman Bright, that's right.

477
00:27:32,396 --> 00:27:35,515
Five hours later. Did I not tell you
to find him a private room?

478
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:38,810
- He didn't want a private room.
- You should've given him one anyway.

479
00:27:38,985 --> 00:27:42,436
He should have had two doctors
and five nurses over him every minute.

480
00:27:42,613 --> 00:27:44,938
" Can I get you anything?
More ice for your knee? "

481
00:27:45,115 --> 00:27:47,321
- We only have five nurse-
- I don't give a damn.

482
00:27:47,492 --> 00:27:51,786
Whatever he needs, whatever he wants,
you do it and you do it now.

483
00:27:54,165 --> 00:27:55,908
Here you go.

484
00:27:56,709 --> 00:27:59,034
- That was a little rude.
- Stay out of it.

485
00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:01,832
- Excuse me, could I have your attention?
- So was that.

486
00:28:02,005 --> 00:28:07,165
With 200 fewer seats, larger rehearsal
hall and dressing rooms, world-class...

487
00:28:07,343 --> 00:28:10,379
My grandmother doesn't want me to be
treasurer of the foundation.

488
00:28:10,554 --> 00:28:12,926
- She wants me to quit working.
- She's old.

489
00:28:13,098 --> 00:28:15,636
She's probably looking to you
to take some of her load.

490
00:28:15,809 --> 00:28:18,845
Embrace my familial responsibilities?

491
00:28:19,687 --> 00:28:20,932
Join the family business?

492
00:28:21,481 --> 00:28:24,102
Which is what exactly?

493
00:28:24,275 --> 00:28:26,944
It's this. It's giving away money.
It's cutting ribbons.

494
00:28:27,111 --> 00:28:29,150
It's waving to the common man.

495
00:28:29,321 --> 00:28:31,313
It's Prince Charles without the castle.

496
00:28:31,489 --> 00:28:34,158
Don't know about no castle.
Seen your grandmother's house.

497
00:28:34,325 --> 00:28:37,242
Abby, I know that you mean well...

498
00:28:37,411 --> 00:28:41,409
...but don't try to tell me
what to do with my life, okay?

499
00:28:41,582 --> 00:28:43,788
- Okay.
- John Carter.

500
00:28:56,011 --> 00:28:57,754
CT's ready and he's waking up.

501
00:28:57,929 --> 00:28:59,969
- Where's my dad?
- We called him.

502
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,515
How did you get hurt, David?

503
00:29:02,475 --> 00:29:05,891
- I fell off the top bunk.
- Okay, we' re gonna take care of you.

504
00:29:06,062 --> 00:29:09,015
This is Chuny. She's taking you
up to get a few more tests, okay?

505
00:29:09,189 --> 00:29:11,680
- You'll find my dad?
- We've already called him, honey.

506
00:29:11,858 --> 00:29:15,309
- He should be here any minute.
- Dr. Kovac, kid's x-rays are back.

507
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:19,187
Finally. I thought Tuesday nights
were not busy, huh?

508
00:29:19,365 --> 00:29:21,192
Who told you that?

509
00:29:21,617 --> 00:29:23,775
- Oh, damn it.
- What?

510
00:29:23,952 --> 00:29:26,621
- Is DCFS still around?
- Excuse me.

511
00:29:26,788 --> 00:29:29,361
They told me my son was back here.
David Scott.

512
00:29:29,541 --> 00:29:32,541
Ambulance brought him in a
few minutes ago. He fell out of bed.

513
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:34,868
- Mr. Scott?
- Yeah.

514
00:29:35,045 --> 00:29:37,002
Where is he? Is he okay?

515
00:29:37,172 --> 00:29:40,089
Your son has a broken wrist
and he hit his head.

516
00:29:42,218 --> 00:29:45,587
He gets hurt all the time.
More since his mom left.

517
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:50,391
- His exams showed some old injuries.
- Yeah. You see, he doesn't pay attention.

518
00:29:50,851 --> 00:29:52,511
The injuries are suspicious.

519
00:29:54,062 --> 00:29:55,556
What?

520
00:29:55,814 --> 00:29:57,723
Are you suggesting
that I hurt my own son?

521
00:29:58,107 --> 00:30:02,318
- Do you?
- No. No, of course not.

522
00:30:04,947 --> 00:30:10,153
We' re giving her all the right antibiotics,
but her sepsis is very advanced.

523
00:30:10,326 --> 00:30:12,900
So, what are her chances?

524
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:15,451
I'm afraid they' re not very good.

525
00:30:16,457 --> 00:30:19,457
I just need to determine...

526
00:30:19,626 --> 00:30:23,789
...what is the best living situation
for your brother and sister.

527
00:30:23,963 --> 00:30:25,161
Yeah.

528
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:28,673
Do you think living with you
is the best thing for them?

529
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:30,669
Probably not.

530
00:30:30,845 --> 00:30:33,466
So I should find someplace else
for them to stay?

531
00:30:33,639 --> 00:30:36,212
Wait a minute. You' re not trying
to keep them together?

532
00:30:38,518 --> 00:30:42,218
- Is this coming from you?
- I think Doug agrees that foster care...

533
00:30:42,396 --> 00:30:44,638
...is the best option
for his brother and sister.

534
00:30:44,815 --> 00:30:46,808
Doug, do you know
what foster care is like?

535
00:30:46,984 --> 00:30:51,313
- Most likely, they won't even be together.
- We'll do our best to keep them together.

536
00:30:51,488 --> 00:30:54,157
- But that doesn't always happen, right?
- We do our best.

537
00:30:54,991 --> 00:30:57,030
Do you know what that means?

538
00:30:58,452 --> 00:31:00,195
That means they' re gonna
get split up.

539
00:31:00,913 --> 00:31:03,866
Their mom's dying,
and they' re gonna be separated.

540
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,374
Living with strangers,
is that what you want?

541
00:31:09,545 --> 00:31:12,462
- Hey, Doug. Doug.
- Oh, she's right.

542
00:31:12,631 --> 00:31:14,540
Listen, your mom might die.

543
00:31:14,716 --> 00:31:16,839
You need to stay together.
They love you, man.

544
00:31:17,469 --> 00:31:21,134
Right, right. The dumb stoner
who makes them laugh.

545
00:31:21,306 --> 00:31:26,216
- You care about them. That matters.
- Hey, I can't take care of two kids.

546
00:31:26,393 --> 00:31:28,516
You'd be surprised
at what you can do.

547
00:31:30,147 --> 00:31:31,724
No.

548
00:31:32,274 --> 00:31:37,231
Hey, trust me. I know.
You just need to step up.

549
00:31:40,197 --> 00:31:45,238
You never should have called me.
All right? My mom's right.

550
00:31:47,037 --> 00:31:48,946
They' re all right.

551
00:31:50,623 --> 00:31:52,912
Make them wrong.

552
00:31:54,335 --> 00:31:57,169
I can't, all right?

553
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:07,962
Bright to Williams, right?
Got the new label?

554
00:32:08,138 --> 00:32:10,807
- Specimen two was mislabeled.
- Happens.

555
00:32:10,974 --> 00:32:13,975
We don't want the paperwork guys
to strike us dead.

556
00:32:14,144 --> 00:32:17,263
We just need a Dr. Hancock.

557
00:32:23,152 --> 00:32:25,607
- That's it?
- That's it.

558
00:32:27,072 --> 00:32:30,275
I think Shaw's is open late
if you still wanna get something to eat.

559
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:32,359
No, I'm not hungry.

560
00:32:32,535 --> 00:32:35,986
Not hungry, or pissed at me?

561
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:42,285
I'm sorry, but I don't think you have
any right to lecture me about my family.

562
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:47,621
Was that an apology?

563
00:32:48,215 --> 00:32:51,501
- I don't owe you an apology.
- Ticket, sir?

564
00:32:53,595 --> 00:32:55,671
Look, you want me to end up
like my father?

565
00:32:55,847 --> 00:32:58,005
At Gamma's beck and call,
handing out checks...

566
00:32:58,183 --> 00:33:02,262
...so the Art Institute gets a de Kooning
or the symphony can have travertine-

567
00:33:02,436 --> 00:33:06,054
Why don't you just get involved with
the foundation and change the priorities?

568
00:33:06,231 --> 00:33:10,181
Give the money to health care, education.
Anything you feel passionate about.

569
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,894
I feel passionate about what I do.
I feel passionate about County.

570
00:33:14,071 --> 00:33:16,360
- Who says you can't do both?
- I do.

571
00:33:16,532 --> 00:33:19,283
Okay, look, you were born
really, really rich.

572
00:33:19,451 --> 00:33:22,701
- So what? It's nothing to be ashamed of.
- I'm not ashamed of who I am.

573
00:33:22,871 --> 00:33:26,037
No? You drive a Jeep.

574
00:33:26,207 --> 00:33:28,876
You wear a cheap watch.
You rent a two-bedroom apartment.

575
00:33:29,043 --> 00:33:32,827
- What do you want? Me to drive a BMW?
- No. I don't care.

576
00:33:33,005 --> 00:33:36,420
I couldn't care less. But you care a lot.

577
00:33:36,591 --> 00:33:40,174
You want everybody to think
that you' re just like them and you' re not.

578
00:33:40,345 --> 00:33:43,678
You just signed a check for $10 million
in there. You didn't even blink.

579
00:33:43,848 --> 00:33:45,923
I write a check for over $100,
I get a stomachache.

580
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,673
I give something more important
than money. I give time.

581
00:33:48,852 --> 00:33:51,687
I do it every day to real people
and it makes a difference.

582
00:33:51,855 --> 00:33:54,642
And I think that's great.
I really, really do.

583
00:33:54,816 --> 00:33:56,808
But money makes a difference too.

584
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:59,768
You know where my money
comes from?

585
00:33:59,945 --> 00:34:03,029
You know where the money for the
Carter Symphony Hall comes from?

586
00:34:03,573 --> 00:34:08,401
Great-grandfather made a killing in the
Depression cornering the coal market.

587
00:34:08,578 --> 00:34:11,662
In the winter of 1933,
a lot of children froze to death.

588
00:34:12,373 --> 00:34:17,120
- And my family made out like bandits.
- That was 70 years ago, Carter.

589
00:34:17,294 --> 00:34:19,167
You can't give the money back now.

590
00:34:19,921 --> 00:34:22,875
Why not help give it to people
who really need it?

591
00:34:23,049 --> 00:34:25,966
There are still lots of kids
freezing to death every winter.

592
00:34:27,261 --> 00:34:28,969
Black Jeep.

593
00:34:32,307 --> 00:34:34,679
- How's the knee?
- Sore.

594
00:34:34,851 --> 00:34:38,765
Well, swelling's down.
Looks like we can get you started home.

595
00:34:38,938 --> 00:34:41,393
Almost 11. Should be safe.

596
00:34:41,565 --> 00:34:45,479
Right, local news usually packs up
and goes home if they miss the 10:00.

597
00:34:45,652 --> 00:34:46,897
I'll go get the car.

598
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:51,815
All right. Your thigh will probably be
a little sore from the penicillin shot.

599
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:56,243
How do we stand
on the medical-records issue?

600
00:34:57,746 --> 00:34:59,074
It's been handled.

601
00:35:00,081 --> 00:35:04,542
Good. Good.
Thank you for your discretion.

602
00:35:05,795 --> 00:35:07,787
I'm glad I could help.

603
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:09,786
Bright is discharged, Jerry.

604
00:35:09,965 --> 00:35:12,538
- Did we ever get his labs back?
- They' re negative.

605
00:35:12,718 --> 00:35:14,461
That lesion was right out of Netter's.

606
00:35:14,636 --> 00:35:17,127
- We should run it again.
- It's fine.

607
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:21,090
- He could have untreated syphilis.
- He's fine. Let it go.

608
00:35:21,267 --> 00:35:22,891
Don't touch me.

609
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:26,096
Yeah. Almost midnight.
Let the shouting begin.

610
00:35:26,271 --> 00:35:29,474
- He's scared. He needs me.
- We can talk here or go to the precinct.

611
00:35:29,649 --> 00:35:31,309
- This is you, right?
- Calm down.

612
00:35:31,484 --> 00:35:35,149
No, I'm okay. But this is crazy.
I have never hurt my son.

613
00:35:37,573 --> 00:35:38,818
I'm gonna call my lawyer.

614
00:35:38,991 --> 00:35:41,660
- What the hell was that about?
- Father abusing his son.

615
00:35:41,827 --> 00:35:44,661
- Where's Social Services?
- They were busy.

616
00:35:44,829 --> 00:35:46,489
So you called the police?

617
00:35:46,664 --> 00:35:49,665
- Kid has multiple old fractures.
- Wait. Did you talk to the child?

618
00:35:49,834 --> 00:35:52,075
Of course I did. He was scared.

619
00:35:57,966 --> 00:35:59,424
Hey.

620
00:35:59,592 --> 00:36:03,803
You got the blue cast.
It's my favorite.

621
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:06,387
Is my dad coming back?

622
00:36:06,557 --> 00:36:09,806
Well, he had to talk to some people.

623
00:36:10,477 --> 00:36:14,770
- You get along pretty well with your dad?
- Better since Mom left.

624
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:17,097
He says we' re like Starsky and Hutch.

625
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:20,692
That's an old TV show
we watch on Nick at Nite.

626
00:36:20,861 --> 00:36:24,027
- Sounds nice.
- Yeah.

627
00:36:25,615 --> 00:36:27,773
You've been hurt a lot
in the last few months.

628
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,615
I don't pay enough attention.

629
00:36:35,624 --> 00:36:38,708
Did you really fall
out of bed today, David?

630
00:36:43,047 --> 00:36:44,790
I...

631
00:36:46,634 --> 00:36:48,211
I jumped.

632
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:55,390
Is that the truth, David?
It's okay. You can tell me.

633
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:22,164
Hello?

634
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:24,914
We' re closed.

635
00:37:25,084 --> 00:37:29,544
- Dr. McNulty?
- If you' re sick, go to County.

636
00:37:33,592 --> 00:37:36,628
Dr. McNulty, we met the other day.
I'm Dr. Carter.

637
00:37:36,803 --> 00:37:39,128
You left before your tests came back.

638
00:37:39,305 --> 00:37:42,839
Your blood sugar was 435.
Your diabetes is way out of control.

639
00:37:43,017 --> 00:37:46,183
- I take my Orinase.
- Orinase?

640
00:37:46,353 --> 00:37:49,721
- They still make that?
- Works fine for me.

641
00:37:49,898 --> 00:37:54,440
Not according to your tests.
There are newer, better drugs.

642
00:37:55,277 --> 00:37:58,064
Yeah. Thanks.

643
00:37:58,322 --> 00:37:59,816
Goodbye.

644
00:38:01,825 --> 00:38:05,988
You' re not gonna be able to help anybody
down here if you' re in a coma or dead.

645
00:38:09,123 --> 00:38:10,747
Actos. Six-month supply.

646
00:38:10,916 --> 00:38:14,664
Hey, hey, you steal those from County?
There are laws against that.

647
00:38:15,629 --> 00:38:17,502
You gotta watch your sugar too.

648
00:38:18,131 --> 00:38:19,708
Sure.

649
00:38:19,882 --> 00:38:22,634
Don't get your tux dirty
on the way out.

650
00:38:28,098 --> 00:38:30,553
Looks like you could use
new equipment around here.

651
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,394
No, no. You' re not doing that.

652
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:36,396
You can get yourself a cardiac monitor.

653
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,223
Chemistry analyzer.

654
00:38:38,982 --> 00:38:43,359
Twelve-lead.
Anything else you might need.

655
00:38:44,112 --> 00:38:46,188
What's this? White liberal guilt?

656
00:38:46,989 --> 00:38:48,567
Probably.

657
00:38:48,741 --> 00:38:51,066
Lots of guilt.

658
00:38:52,578 --> 00:38:54,487
No, thanks.

659
00:38:54,955 --> 00:38:57,825
I'm not here to make you feel better.

660
00:38:58,917 --> 00:39:01,454
There must be something I can do.

661
00:39:02,003 --> 00:39:03,461
Yeah.

662
00:39:03,629 --> 00:39:05,372
You can sweep.

663
00:39:09,718 --> 00:39:12,718
- Did ICU come for my pneumonia?
- Went up a couple of minutes ago.

664
00:39:12,887 --> 00:39:15,804
DCFS is taking the kids
up to say goodbye.

665
00:39:15,973 --> 00:39:19,342
- Hey, she's still alive, right?
- Yeah.

666
00:39:19,518 --> 00:39:23,350
- You came back.
- Well, I never really left.

667
00:39:24,189 --> 00:39:28,518
You know, she said I was
the biggest mistake of her life.

668
00:39:30,653 --> 00:39:33,226
I don't want to let them down...

669
00:39:33,989 --> 00:39:37,938
- ... but I don't know if I can do it.
- You just do the best that you can.

670
00:39:38,118 --> 00:39:39,612
That'll be enough.

671
00:39:42,914 --> 00:39:45,950
Come on. I'll take you up to see them.

672
00:39:48,877 --> 00:39:51,961
- Stay with her as long as you want.
- Okay.

673
00:39:52,756 --> 00:39:54,463
Go ahead.

674
00:39:55,049 --> 00:39:56,958
Thanks.

675
00:39:59,678 --> 00:40:03,047
- He came back, huh?
- Yeah.

676
00:40:04,516 --> 00:40:07,386
Hey, I was out of line before.

677
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,885
Whatever. I'm an adult.
I can handle it.

678
00:40:10,063 --> 00:40:14,309
- You should worry about those two kids.
- Hey, Pratt. Phone call.

679
00:40:15,651 --> 00:40:19,102
Hello. Dr. Pratt. Hey, Mrs. Knightly.

680
00:40:19,279 --> 00:40:20,773
What?

681
00:40:22,073 --> 00:40:24,480
Oh, man. When?

682
00:40:24,784 --> 00:40:26,242
Okay.

683
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:28,652
Jerry, I'm off in 15.
Tell Weaver I had to leave.

684
00:40:28,829 --> 00:40:32,032
I'll come in early
and make it up in the morning.

685
00:40:32,207 --> 00:40:35,492
- Was that Pratt leaving again?
- Yeah. He had to go early.

686
00:40:35,668 --> 00:40:37,293
- Go where?
- Didn't say.

687
00:40:37,462 --> 00:40:41,044
Well, guess what? I want to go too.
Maybe I should just leave.

688
00:40:41,257 --> 00:40:44,921
What do you say?
Just leave because I feel like it.

689
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:49,673
Your child abuser was a case of a boy
wanting to spend time with his father.

690
00:40:49,848 --> 00:40:51,010
- Who? The Scott kid?
- Yes.

691
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:55,475
The kid hurts himself so Dad will
stay home and watch TV with him.

692
00:40:55,644 --> 00:40:59,476
- Did you page me for a post-op seroma?
- Yeah. Exam 4.

693
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:02,103
Your Mr. Callahan's finally in Recovery.

694
00:41:02,275 --> 00:41:05,893
Send your patients up to the O. R.
a bit more promptly in future, all right?

695
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:10,233
And next time, get DCFS down here
before you call the cops.

696
00:41:33,469 --> 00:41:35,960
Tom's out of surgery.

697
00:41:36,222 --> 00:41:38,179
He's gonna be okay.

698
00:41:40,726 --> 00:41:42,683
You can let go now.

699
00:41:47,565 --> 00:41:50,768
Pratt left again? Man, when I was
an intern, it was a full-time job.

700
00:41:50,943 --> 00:41:52,141
Yeah. It still is.

701
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:55,189
I just want to go home
and get into bed.

702
00:41:55,364 --> 00:41:58,981
What do you think the odds are that
Antonio Banderas will be waiting for me?

703
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:02,112
Oh, I almost forgot. Here.

704
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:05,903
I know it's a little early, but I was
in Field's buying a gift for my niece...

705
00:42:06,081 --> 00:42:07,457
...and I saw the infant stuff.

706
00:42:07,624 --> 00:42:09,996
I pass those little clothes
and I go into a trance.

707
00:42:10,168 --> 00:42:11,828
- I have to buy something.
- Susan...

708
00:42:12,003 --> 00:42:15,917
Those Onesies and jumpers, they have
control over me. And the little shoes.

709
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:18,842
I don't know if it's a boy or girl
so I got green, neutral.

710
00:42:19,009 --> 00:42:22,876
- If you hate it, I have the gift receipts-
- I'm not pregnant anymore.

711
00:42:25,265 --> 00:42:27,174
I miscarried.

712
00:42:28,017 --> 00:42:33,687
Oh, God. Kerry, I'm so sorry.

713
00:42:36,775 --> 00:42:38,898
Embryonic loss rate...

714
00:42:38,985 --> 00:42:42,354
after implantation is about
30 percent in IVF. It isn't rare.

715
00:42:44,532 --> 00:42:47,735
- Thank you for the thought.
- Sure.

716
00:42:48,452 --> 00:42:52,698
And when you see Pratt, why don't you
remind him this is a full-time job?

717
00:42:52,873 --> 00:42:54,616
Good night.

718
00:42:55,041 --> 00:42:57,532
They brought him in on a 10-29,
possible stolen car.

719
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:00,580
Car was clean. But they found
a shotgun with a clipped barrel.

720
00:43:00,754 --> 00:43:03,210
The others have criminal paper,
your brother's clear.

721
00:43:03,382 --> 00:43:05,955
Just hanging next to the wrong car
at the wrong time.

722
00:43:06,134 --> 00:43:08,542
This is against like 15 regs,
so make it fast.

723
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,428
Thanks.

724
00:43:10,638 --> 00:43:12,631
I ever get shot,
I want to end up at County.

725
00:43:12,807 --> 00:43:15,344
- You guys always take care of us.
- Thank you.

726
00:43:15,517 --> 00:43:19,016
Don't be mad. Don't be mad, G.
Please, it wasn't my fault.

727
00:43:19,187 --> 00:43:21,678
It was Dukey's fault.
He's the one that had the gun.

728
00:43:21,856 --> 00:43:24,525
What were you doing with those boys?
Didn't they hurt you?

729
00:43:24,692 --> 00:43:27,017
I was telling them about
the job you got for me.

730
00:43:27,194 --> 00:43:29,103
While I was telling them,
the cops came.

731
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,901
Okay, okay, listen to me.
Do not talk to anybody in here.

732
00:43:32,074 --> 00:43:34,825
Not the police, no one.
Not until I get you a lawyer.

733
00:43:34,993 --> 00:43:38,611
Tell Mr. Keegan I won't be late next time.

734
00:43:38,788 --> 00:43:41,492
- Leon...
- Was he mad? Tell him I promise.

735
00:43:41,665 --> 00:43:44,701
Leon, you didn't show up.
You probably lost that job.

736
00:43:46,586 --> 00:43:49,706
No, G. No.

737
00:43:50,924 --> 00:43:55,715
I don't want to stay in here, G.
Come on, please? Can't we go home?

738
00:43:55,886 --> 00:43:59,053
The judge sets bail in the morning.
Then I can take you home.

739
00:43:59,223 --> 00:44:01,844
- In the morning? I-
- Doc, you gotta go.

740
00:44:02,017 --> 00:44:04,804
G, I can't spend the night here.
I don't know these people.

741
00:44:04,978 --> 00:44:07,515
- First thing in the morning, okay?
- Doc?

742
00:44:07,688 --> 00:44:09,894
- G.
- First thing.

743
00:44:10,065 --> 00:44:13,516
Don't leave me, G.
G, don't do that, G.

744
00:44:13,694 --> 00:44:15,935
G, come on. G.

745
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:17,690
G.

746
00:44:17,864 --> 00:44:21,398
Don't leave me here. Come on.
