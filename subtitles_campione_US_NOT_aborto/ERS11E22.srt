2
00:00:04,644 --> 00:00:05,854
<i>Previously on ER</i>

3
00:00:05,955 --> 00:00:07,673
What? You had Frank snoop on Steve?

4
00:00:07,774 --> 00:00:11,155
He robbed a market outside Denver.
The cashier got hurt.

5
00:00:11,256 --> 00:00:13,523
Failure to recall basic
respiratory principles

6
00:00:13,724 --> 00:00:15,552
unsupervised umbilical lines
in an infant

7
00:00:15,653 --> 00:00:17,913
and a fatal air embolus.

8
00:00:18,114 --> 00:00:21,650
Don't sign this contract unless you
are sure this is what you want to do.

9
00:00:22,151 --> 00:00:23,270
- You from Chicago?
- Mmm-mm.

10
00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:25,535
Any relation to Charlie Pratt?

11
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:27,954
- I don't know him.
- I'm moving back to Africa.

12
00:00:28,455 --> 00:00:31,395
And I'm not leaving without you,
and I'm not living without you.

14
00:00:33,104 --> 00:00:34,973
I love you.

15
00:00:41,601 --> 00:00:43,061
I rented a ninja movie for Alex.

16
00:00:43,228 --> 00:00:45,062
We can watch it tonight
when I get home.

17
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:46,939
He's got a math test in the morning.

18
00:00:47,106 --> 00:00:50,693
Hard to keep track.
He's not talking much lately.

19
00:00:50,943 --> 00:00:54,279
Alex keeps asking me
when he can visit his dad.

20
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:58,031
- You think that's a good idea?
- He doesn't know.

21
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:02,327
Steve keeps telling him
that he's got some new job in Colorado.

22
00:01:02,995 --> 00:01:05,788
Sam, you've got to tell Alex the truth.

23
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,625
Steve promised me that he would.

24
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:11,960
You want me to tell him?

25
00:01:12,586 --> 00:01:16,715
Hey, hey. Can I get a hand with this?

26
00:01:16,882 --> 00:01:18,883
- Farewell feast?
- Yeah, take that.

27
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:21,135
Pizza and sodas.
I think I got off cheap.

28
00:01:21,302 --> 00:01:22,928
Africa, huh?

29
00:01:23,095 --> 00:01:24,804
That's where she is.

30
00:01:24,971 --> 00:01:28,641
I gotta go, I don't have a babysitter.
Sorry I'm gonna miss your party.

31
00:01:29,601 --> 00:01:31,977
Take care of yourself, Dr. Carter.

32
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:37,440
Party?

33
00:01:37,607 --> 00:01:40,067
Shut up. It's a surprise.

34
00:01:42,153 --> 00:01:46,197
- I can't believe it's your last shift.
- Last 72 minutes, to be exact.

35
00:01:46,781 --> 00:01:48,074
But who's counting?

36
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:50,743
Okay, come and get it.

37
00:01:51,076 --> 00:01:53,037
Carnivores, veggies.

38
00:01:53,203 --> 00:01:55,456
Eleven years,
all we get's a few lousy pizzas?

39
00:01:55,623 --> 00:01:58,917
- I was gonna get Search and Rescue.
- I took a detour by the river.

40
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:01,336
Wanted to see the lights
at the Wrigley Building.

41
00:02:01,502 --> 00:02:04,922
Must have been after
you picked up the pies. This is cold.

42
00:02:05,297 --> 00:02:06,798
You wanna rethink the pizza?

43
00:02:06,965 --> 00:02:10,259
Dr. Carter, we have a Resident for a fall,
an outstretched hand?

44
00:02:10,426 --> 00:02:13,262
- I'll take it.
- I'm Miss Fleming, the school nurse.

45
00:02:13,429 --> 00:02:16,014
- This is Janell.
- How did this happen, Janell?

46
00:02:16,181 --> 00:02:19,851
Well, I tried to spike the ball
and I got caught in the net.

47
00:02:20,018 --> 00:02:22,269
She's very energetic.

48
00:02:22,436 --> 00:02:24,855
Are they Residents
because they live in the hospital?

49
00:02:25,022 --> 00:02:26,982
And very curious.

50
00:02:27,149 --> 00:02:29,192
Is it true people can have
face transplants?

51
00:02:29,359 --> 00:02:32,487
Yes, it is. In fact, I'm 80 years old.

52
00:02:32,654 --> 00:02:34,363
I got this off a dead guy.

53
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:37,074
I'm leaving an 18-month-old
with febrile seizure in 2.

54
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,701
- Give it to Abby or Neela.
- All right.

55
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,411
- Still post-ictal but temp's coming down.
- You got a CT?

56
00:02:42,578 --> 00:02:44,330
- No history of trauma.
- Healthy?

57
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,999
- The kid's got a URI, no meningismus.
- So you've figured out...

58
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:49,626
...a way to evaluate meningismus
in toddlers? Congratulations.

59
00:02:49,793 --> 00:02:51,836
- How long's the kid been here?
- Half an hour.

60
00:02:52,003 --> 00:02:55,130
LP's not indicated but if he's
not back to baseline in an hour...

61
00:02:55,297 --> 00:02:56,548
- ...we get it anyway.
- Good.

62
00:02:56,715 --> 00:02:58,884
The next set of victims
is on their way.

63
00:02:59,051 --> 00:03:02,261
We got four locals, plus one from Penn
and one from Vanderbilt.

64
00:03:02,428 --> 00:03:05,473
Hacker with a paronychia
needs a quick I&D in Exam 2.

65
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,017
But since my shift's not over
for six more minutes, I'll handle it.

66
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:11,561
Come on, what's some cuticle pus
between friends?

67
00:03:11,728 --> 00:03:13,229
You gotta get each other's backs.

68
00:03:13,396 --> 00:03:15,564
Exam 2, paronychia, I&D.

69
00:03:15,731 --> 00:03:18,401
- I'll get your next prolapsed rectum.
- You're a peach.

70
00:03:18,567 --> 00:03:20,985
Cubs game starts in an hour.
You wanna grab a beer?

71
00:03:21,152 --> 00:03:24,155
Sorry, but my buddy's having a party
and I promised I'd be there.

72
00:03:24,322 --> 00:03:25,740
Sounds good. Meet you in front.

73
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:28,242
We'll stop by my place
so I can change.

74
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:31,036
And if you look here,
this is the Admit area.

75
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,705
I want you to take a look
at these sad and tired faces.

76
00:03:34,872 --> 00:03:36,707
See, you're the before pictures.

77
00:03:36,874 --> 00:03:38,751
And I want you to meet the after.

78
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:41,586
- Trying to frighten them?
- Jane, congratulations.

79
00:03:41,753 --> 00:03:43,547
Yeah, I was counting on Bellevue.

80
00:03:43,713 --> 00:03:45,840
Nice to see you again, Abby.

81
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:48,759
- I'm sorry?
- I trailed you a few days...

82
00:03:48,926 --> 00:03:52,011
- ...during my third year, Jim Babinski.
- As in the Babinski reflex?

83
00:03:52,178 --> 00:03:54,472
- Cool. Any relation?
- Nope. Not at all.

84
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:58,308
I'm gonna go get them some lockers
and then let them tail you guys around.

85
00:03:58,475 --> 00:04:00,310
Finally getting the long coats, huh?

86
00:04:00,936 --> 00:04:02,938
Pretty thrilling.

87
00:04:04,314 --> 00:04:06,482
Here we go. Lesson number one:
floor control.

88
00:04:06,649 --> 00:04:09,235
Sir, sir, you have to get back
on the gurney, come on.

89
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:12,487
Are we really about to become R2s?

90
00:04:12,654 --> 00:04:14,072
No turning back now.

91
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,825
My contract is signed
and sealed on Lewis' desk.

92
00:04:16,992 --> 00:04:18,242
Mine too.

93
00:04:18,409 --> 00:04:21,787
- Yeah, I got some things to think about.
- Like what?

94
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:26,291
Susan was just pushing you, Ray.
Don't let it get to you.

95
00:04:26,457 --> 00:04:29,127
I don't know. Maybe she was right.

96
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,712
Maybe it's time for me
to make a change.

97
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:34,298
- Get back on the gurney.
- No.

98
00:04:34,965 --> 00:04:38,217
- No!
- Sir, you got to calm down.

99
00:04:39,385 --> 00:04:40,761
Get him off, come on!

100
00:04:40,928 --> 00:04:42,471
- Take it easy.
- Calm down.

101
00:04:42,638 --> 00:04:45,473
Lucky for us, interns bounce.

102
00:05:37,017 --> 00:05:38,268
I might not have any fun?

103
00:05:38,435 --> 00:05:40,145
You're not gonna know anybody.

104
00:05:40,312 --> 00:05:42,688
You never know,
I'm into the music scene.

105
00:05:42,855 --> 00:05:44,607
Gigs, demos, whatnot.

106
00:05:44,774 --> 00:05:46,359
- How's it going, guys?
- All good.

107
00:05:46,525 --> 00:05:49,527
- Is Nick around?
- Try in the penthouse.

108
00:05:53,657 --> 00:05:55,366
Good to get out sometimes, isn't it?

109
00:05:55,949 --> 00:05:59,286
Forget about the daily responsibility
we carry as healers...

110
00:05:59,453 --> 00:06:02,080
...and just mingle with regular people.

111
00:06:02,246 --> 00:06:04,040
Okay, listen, don't talk like that.

112
00:06:04,207 --> 00:06:06,292
- What? Like a doctor?
- Like a bonehead.

113
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:10,170
I wouldn't wanna see you get bounced
down all these stairs by my pals.

114
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:12,089
Duly noted.

115
00:06:13,256 --> 00:06:16,300
- Hey, Riles. What's up?
- What's up? Make yourself at home, bro.

116
00:06:16,467 --> 00:06:19,053
- Beer upstairs?
- Yeah. Catch me later.

117
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,054
- This is about me being chief.
- What?

118
00:06:21,221 --> 00:06:23,556
- You're a little bitter.
- I couldn't care less.

119
00:06:23,723 --> 00:06:26,101
- Been meaning to talk to you about that.
- What?

120
00:06:26,267 --> 00:06:28,560
Your lack of initiative.

121
00:06:30,187 --> 00:06:31,855
- Yo, Barnett.
- Hey.

122
00:06:32,022 --> 00:06:33,064
What's up?

123
00:06:33,231 --> 00:06:35,775
- Hey, bro.
- How's it hanging?

124
00:06:35,942 --> 00:06:38,403
This is Archie. We work together.

125
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:40,445
Thought you were gonna bring
the roomie.

126
00:06:40,612 --> 00:06:44,741
Neela had to work.
Is Jessica here? Yeah, she is.

127
00:06:47,201 --> 00:06:48,577
So you a doctor?

128
00:06:48,744 --> 00:06:50,663
Chief Resident.

129
00:06:51,372 --> 00:06:53,706
That means, like, nothing to me.

130
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:56,918
Hey, Vanessa!

131
00:06:57,502 --> 00:06:59,294
Nice meeting you.

132
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:10,680
- Okay, Mr. Enriquez.
- Are you gonna crack his chest?

133
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,181
That feels like a ganglion cyst.

134
00:07:13,348 --> 00:07:15,392
What's "ganglion" mean?

135
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:17,811
Have you had any luck
finding her parents?

136
00:07:17,977 --> 00:07:19,979
She was to be
at a friend's house tonight.

137
00:07:20,146 --> 00:07:22,189
They're stuck out on a lake cruise.

138
00:07:22,356 --> 00:07:24,524
They wanted a romantic night out.

139
00:07:24,691 --> 00:07:26,693
Just the two of them.

140
00:07:27,402 --> 00:07:29,154
I bet they did.

141
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,071
So? Can you fix it?

142
00:07:31,697 --> 00:07:35,450
Well, unless it bothers you,
I would avoid the surgery.

143
00:07:35,617 --> 00:07:38,119
Most of the time,
these things turn out to be benign.

144
00:07:38,286 --> 00:07:39,620
If you say so.

145
00:07:39,787 --> 00:07:43,623
- What's "benign" mean?
- Janell, stop bothering the doctor.

146
00:07:44,082 --> 00:07:45,417
Who says I'm bothering him?

147
00:07:45,584 --> 00:07:48,128
Dr. Carter, I just got a call
from Building Services.

148
00:07:48,295 --> 00:07:51,213
- The sewer pipes they fixed last week...
- They're broken again?

149
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,923
So we only have one O.R. open.

150
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:57,343
All right, let's watch the Trauma traffic
and try not to get overextended.

151
00:07:57,719 --> 00:07:59,888
- Break out the buckets.
- Is Curtain 2 clear?

152
00:08:00,054 --> 00:08:01,431
Pick a bed, any bed.

153
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:03,974
Thirty-two-year-old actor
smacked by falling scenery.

154
00:08:04,141 --> 00:08:06,518
Now, are you a bull cow
or are you for milking?

155
00:08:06,685 --> 00:08:08,687
- Bleeding won't stop.
- Should have been wearing...

156
00:08:08,854 --> 00:08:11,105
- ...your headpiece.
- I was. It broke.

157
00:08:11,272 --> 00:08:12,648
A and O times four, no LOC.

158
00:08:12,815 --> 00:08:15,192
- All right, Neela, got it?
- Good thing I'm not Hindu.

159
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:18,486
Thirty-seven-year-old male,
burns to the torso and extremities.

160
00:08:18,653 --> 00:08:21,031
- What's this about?
- Community theater gone bad.

161
00:08:21,197 --> 00:08:23,324
- It's an Equity showcase.
- Excuse me?

162
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:26,577
We're mounting an original musical
about the Great Chicago Fire.

163
00:08:26,744 --> 00:08:29,996
I had a little tiff
with Mrs. O'Leary's fat cow over there.

164
00:08:30,163 --> 00:08:33,124
- Learn the blocking, you clod.
- Listen for your cue, Elsie.

165
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:36,835
- I'd say you definitely have this.
- I love the theater.

166
00:08:38,086 --> 00:08:39,713
And where might you two be going?

167
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,631
- To get some coffee.
- Ambulance run.

168
00:08:41,797 --> 00:08:43,341
Asthmatic in 3's waking up.

169
00:08:43,507 --> 00:08:44,759
Hey, Chuny, you seen K.J.?

170
00:08:44,926 --> 00:08:46,677
- Who?
- The volunteen kid I hooked up.

171
00:08:46,844 --> 00:08:48,595
Oh, yeah. Nurses' desk.

172
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:51,097
Hey, man, it's not gonna be the same
without you.

173
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:52,849
Oh, you'll survive.

174
00:08:53,016 --> 00:08:54,267
See you at the party?

175
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:58,729
Party? I don't know anything
about any parties.

176
00:08:59,688 --> 00:09:02,357
Hey, finished breaking down
those charts?

177
00:09:02,523 --> 00:09:05,526
Yeah, I took yellows back
to Medical Records like you told me.

178
00:09:05,693 --> 00:09:08,403
Good. It's after 8:00.
What are you still doing here?

179
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,322
Waiting on my dad. He's late.

180
00:09:10,489 --> 00:09:12,866
Well, did he say
how late he was gonna be?

181
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,911
You have anybody
that can take you home?

182
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:18,496
No, but he'll show, though.

183
00:09:21,706 --> 00:09:23,833
All right, come on. I'll take you home.

184
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:27,544
- But first, I gotta hit this party.
- What party?

185
00:09:27,711 --> 00:09:29,213
Check it out, huh?

186
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:32,299
- Oh, music notes?
- No, man.

187
00:09:32,466 --> 00:09:35,551
Try the opening guitar licks
to "Freebird."

188
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,847
Yo, Benny, we got it.

189
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:43,141
You had a hep B shot lately?

190
00:09:43,308 --> 00:09:46,977
That tat's really red around the edges.
You might wanna keep an eye on that.

191
00:09:47,144 --> 00:09:52,690
Oh, my God. Doc Barnett
talking the talk, man, you!

192
00:09:52,857 --> 00:09:56,027
- You're a doctor?
- Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

193
00:09:56,194 --> 00:09:58,446
That's really cool.

194
00:09:58,613 --> 00:10:01,240
Yeah? Then, yes, I'm a doctor.

195
00:10:01,407 --> 00:10:02,950
The baby's really kicking.

196
00:10:03,117 --> 00:10:04,743
You got anything for heartburn?

197
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,620
No, man. How about
some mellowing agents?

198
00:10:07,787 --> 00:10:11,082
Man, there's mellowing agents
all over this place, okay?

199
00:10:11,249 --> 00:10:12,707
It's kind of hot in here.

200
00:10:12,874 --> 00:10:14,709
You want to go get a drink?

201
00:10:14,876 --> 00:10:16,503
Sure.

202
00:10:26,553 --> 00:10:29,139
I thought you were a musician.

203
00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:32,433
Medicine's the way
I pay the music bills.

204
00:10:34,143 --> 00:10:35,727
Hello, up there.

205
00:10:35,894 --> 00:10:37,104
- Yo?
- Beers here!

206
00:10:37,687 --> 00:10:40,690
- What's up?
- Toss us down a couple of brews, bro.

207
00:10:40,857 --> 00:10:42,525
All right.

208
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,823
- Ready?
- Yeah, yeah.

209
00:10:53,325 --> 00:10:55,119
Yeah.

210
00:10:58,872 --> 00:11:01,040
So how's the double life treating you?

211
00:11:01,207 --> 00:11:04,585
Some days better than others.

212
00:11:04,793 --> 00:11:07,212
Hey, any more Jägermeister around?

213
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:09,548
Try inside.

214
00:11:09,715 --> 00:11:11,257
Hey, Archie.

215
00:11:11,424 --> 00:11:14,719
Yeah, I introduced you two
10 minutes ago.

216
00:11:19,306 --> 00:11:21,641
Is that guy really your boss?

217
00:11:21,933 --> 00:11:24,059
That's what he's been saying.

218
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:26,353
I hadn't even kicked the lantern yet.

219
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,355
You missed your cue
on account of mooing.

220
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:30,899
Ten cc's of lido
and 5.0 on a needle driver, please.

221
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,525
I'm doing the job of two actors.

222
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,819
- And giving half a good performance.
- Son of a bitch.

223
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:39,031
Look, unless you'd like a saline shower,
keep your head still.

224
00:11:39,197 --> 00:11:42,074
- How'd you get these burns?
- It must have been the light stand.

225
00:11:42,241 --> 00:11:43,826
I'm not gonna be scarred, am I?

226
00:11:43,993 --> 00:11:45,536
Nothing too serious.

227
00:11:45,703 --> 00:11:47,538
Hey, Abby. Got a minute?

228
00:11:47,705 --> 00:11:49,456
- Sure.
- Because I usually play leads.

229
00:11:49,623 --> 00:11:51,541
Six hundred of ibuprofen
and Silvadene.

230
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:55,127
I use my body a lot as an actor.

231
00:11:55,294 --> 00:11:56,879
You mean like in pornos?

232
00:11:57,046 --> 00:11:59,340
- You've seen my work?
- What an idiot.

233
00:12:00,633 --> 00:12:02,216
Okay, I'll be right back.

234
00:12:03,384 --> 00:12:04,636
What do you need?

235
00:12:04,802 --> 00:12:07,722
There's people waiting at Ike's,
I thought I'd walk Carter over.

236
00:12:07,888 --> 00:12:09,723
- You guys are good?
- We taking traumas?

237
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:12,476
Pipes won't get fixed
for three hours, so not until then.

238
00:12:12,643 --> 00:12:15,770
Okay. And I'd like to get over there
at some point too.

239
00:12:15,937 --> 00:12:17,897
Yeah, we'll rotate.
Back in half an hour.

240
00:12:18,064 --> 00:12:20,857
- You ready to go to my surprise party?
- Yup.

241
00:12:21,024 --> 00:12:22,901
- Hey there.
- Hey.

242
00:12:23,068 --> 00:12:24,903
Did you check your sugar
before dinner?

243
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,363
Ninety-two.

244
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:28,113
That's good.

245
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:31,700
Did Erica help you with your math?

246
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:33,369
Yeah.

247
00:12:33,743 --> 00:12:35,870
Did you tell her
to pick you up tomorrow?

248
00:12:36,037 --> 00:12:37,455
No.

249
00:12:40,082 --> 00:12:43,043
- Are you done with your homework?
- I'm doing it.

250
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:46,338
Oh, looks like you're watching TV
to me.

251
00:12:52,593 --> 00:12:54,344
Got a letter from your dad.

252
00:13:00,391 --> 00:13:02,476
As soon as you finish studying.

253
00:13:02,643 --> 00:13:04,186
- Mom.
- Alex.

254
00:13:04,353 --> 00:13:07,230
- It's my mail.
- My rules.

255
00:13:07,772 --> 00:13:09,565
You're such a-

256
00:13:10,066 --> 00:13:11,734
Excuse me?

257
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:13,735
Where's Luka?

258
00:13:15,112 --> 00:13:16,738
He's at work.

259
00:13:18,156 --> 00:13:20,157
You still fighting?

260
00:13:20,616 --> 00:13:22,076
No.

261
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,455
We're gonna have to move again,
aren't we?

262
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:34,586
Yeah. I'm bringing him right now.

263
00:13:34,753 --> 00:13:37,047
Okay. Right.

264
00:13:37,214 --> 00:13:39,006
What was that about?

265
00:13:39,924 --> 00:13:41,592
Just telling them to be ready.

266
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,761
- Act surprised.
- I'll act surprised.

267
00:13:47,514 --> 00:13:49,433
Surprise!

268
00:13:50,308 --> 00:13:51,851
You guys, you got me!

269
00:13:56,021 --> 00:13:57,397
Ray.

270
00:13:58,064 --> 00:14:02,110
Yo, Ray,
your boy's hurling in here, man.

271
00:14:03,611 --> 00:14:04,987
Stay here, okay?

272
00:14:05,154 --> 00:14:06,989
I won't move.

273
00:14:10,241 --> 00:14:12,201
He almost made it to the bathroom.

274
00:14:12,368 --> 00:14:13,911
Hey, sweetie. You okay?

275
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:15,288
You gonna come out here?

276
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:18,957
Yeah, in one second.
Let me finish talking to these guys.

277
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:26,547
- I'm stupid, stupid, stupid.
- Okay, easy.

278
00:14:26,714 --> 00:14:27,965
Easy.

279
00:14:31,426 --> 00:14:32,927
Hi.

280
00:14:33,344 --> 00:14:36,263
You know, I admire you, Ray.

281
00:14:36,763 --> 00:14:39,183
You're one of those guys who just...

282
00:14:39,474 --> 00:14:42,768
...glide over every speed bump.
It all comes so easy.

283
00:14:43,436 --> 00:14:44,812
But me...

284
00:14:44,979 --> 00:14:47,231
No,
people don't expect much from me.

285
00:14:47,398 --> 00:14:49,316
Most of the time I prove them right.

286
00:14:50,817 --> 00:14:53,904
I guess that's why I wanted chief,
you know?

287
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,863
Show them I could do it.

288
00:14:56,906 --> 00:14:59,033
Well, look,
it's not so easy for me either.

289
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,160
I'm just pretty good at faking it.

290
00:15:04,329 --> 00:15:05,997
Oh, my God.

291
00:15:06,164 --> 00:15:07,790
I'll get you some water.

292
00:15:07,957 --> 00:15:10,500
I swear to God, that's what she said.

293
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:13,921
Get out of here. Hey, he okay?

294
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:16,005
He gets excited.

295
00:15:16,172 --> 00:15:17,465
Ray!

296
00:15:17,632 --> 00:15:18,841
Find me some aspirin too.

297
00:15:20,593 --> 00:15:22,302
Sure thing.

298
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,687
Molly!

299
00:15:36,147 --> 00:15:37,857
- Oh, my God.
- Ray?

300
00:15:39,525 --> 00:15:41,026
Ray!

301
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:42,861
Jess!

302
00:15:43,862 --> 00:15:45,489
No!

303
00:15:45,906 --> 00:15:48,199
God... Oh, my God...

304
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:57,165
Jeremy, open your eyes for me.
Listen to me. Open your eyes, Jeremy.

305
00:15:57,332 --> 00:16:00,709
Okay, call 911! We got at least
20 people injured here.

306
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:04,797
- Oh, man.
- Molly, where are you, baby? Molly!

307
00:16:06,255 --> 00:16:08,633
- My back!
- Give me a hand here, move it!

308
00:16:09,258 --> 00:16:10,677
Duncan's not breathing.

309
00:16:10,843 --> 00:16:13,387
Jess! Jess, I got you. I got you.

310
00:16:13,553 --> 00:16:15,097
- You all right?
- I'm burning.

311
00:16:15,263 --> 00:16:17,391
- You breathing okay?
- Yeah.

312
00:16:17,557 --> 00:16:18,934
Molly!

313
00:16:19,558 --> 00:16:21,018
Help me.

314
00:16:21,185 --> 00:16:24,105
- Hey, over here. This kid's stuck.
- You. You, get over here.

315
00:16:24,271 --> 00:16:27,065
Get over here. Stay with her, okay?

316
00:16:28,775 --> 00:16:30,276
Help me! Somebody help me!

317
00:16:30,443 --> 00:16:31,985
The ambulances are on their way!

318
00:16:32,403 --> 00:16:33,862
Stay with her. Don't move her.

319
00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:36,573
- If she passes out, come get me.
- No, Ray! Don't go!

320
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,242
I'll be back.

321
00:16:38,408 --> 00:16:41,119
Hey, man! Stop that.
Come over here, help me get him out.

322
00:16:41,285 --> 00:16:43,329
Okay, okay.

323
00:16:43,496 --> 00:16:45,789
Talk to me, Molly. Come on.
Keep talking to me.

324
00:16:45,956 --> 00:16:48,125
- My friend's been hurt.
- Can we move this beam?

325
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:51,335
Okay, everybody, stop! Stop!

326
00:16:52,294 --> 00:16:53,629
I'm a doctor, okay?

327
00:16:53,796 --> 00:16:55,506
The paramedics are on their way.

328
00:16:55,673 --> 00:16:59,008
We need to clear out all this crap,
uncover as many bodies as we can.

329
00:16:59,175 --> 00:17:01,094
But nobody move anybody...

330
00:17:02,095 --> 00:17:04,847
...until I get to check
them over first, okay?

331
00:17:06,056 --> 00:17:07,850
- Is the cow all fixed up?
- Both ends.

332
00:17:08,016 --> 00:17:10,519
- May they go now?
- I'll be with you in a moment, sir.

333
00:17:13,146 --> 00:17:16,399
He's here for the actors.
It's his play they ruined.

334
00:17:16,566 --> 00:17:17,983
My stage manager is filling in.

335
00:17:18,483 --> 00:17:22,154
Horrid. But if I can get them back
in time, I might still have a second act.

336
00:17:22,612 --> 00:17:24,488
I doubt these guys are up for it.

337
00:17:24,655 --> 00:17:26,198
Oh, they're professionals.

338
00:17:26,365 --> 00:17:28,075
You know, the show must go on.

339
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:29,827
Yeah.

340
00:17:29,993 --> 00:17:31,744
Why is that exactly?

341
00:17:31,911 --> 00:17:35,707
I mean, why can't the show
just stop once in a while?

342
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,918
Keep the pressure going, okay?
Don't move.

343
00:17:40,085 --> 00:17:43,129
Tachy at 120.
Pulse is weak and thready.

344
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:45,840
- Hurts when I breathe.
- All right, all right.

345
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:48,634
- Breath sounds on the bad side.
- No tension pneumo?

346
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:51,511
Paramedics to him first.
He needs two liters of saline.

347
00:17:51,678 --> 00:17:52,888
Ray, please.

348
00:17:53,054 --> 00:17:55,723
Just another sec, okay?
Jess, you're okay, you're okay.

349
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,683
- Ray!
- They're coming, man.

350
00:17:59,727 --> 00:18:01,187
Ray, come here, man.

351
00:18:01,562 --> 00:18:02,854
I think she cut her ear.

352
00:18:03,021 --> 00:18:04,689
Okay, well, that's one possibility.

353
00:18:04,856 --> 00:18:07,567
Molly! Molly, follow my finger.

354
00:18:08,568 --> 00:18:10,903
- You got a headache?
- I feel okay.

355
00:18:11,069 --> 00:18:13,697
- How many weeks are you?
- Thirty-eight. Is the baby okay?

356
00:18:14,531 --> 00:18:16,449
It's okay, it's okay.

357
00:18:17,491 --> 00:18:19,452
We need some help!

358
00:18:20,703 --> 00:18:22,329
- Benny?
- Oh, my God.

359
00:18:22,495 --> 00:18:24,372
- Keep breathing.
- Oh, my God.

360
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:25,874
You're gonna be okay.

361
00:18:32,504 --> 00:18:34,505
Can I have it now?

362
00:18:35,006 --> 00:18:36,674
On the table.

363
00:18:42,846 --> 00:18:44,264
Mom?

364
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,475
Are we ever gonna live with Dad
again?

365
00:18:47,642 --> 00:18:50,227
- Alex.
- He's got a good job now.

366
00:18:50,394 --> 00:18:52,730
He's a river guide. It's cool.

367
00:18:53,688 --> 00:18:55,899
We're not gonna live with your dad.

368
00:18:58,401 --> 00:19:01,111
Hey, I got you
those marshmallow cookies.

369
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,906
I'm gonna go read my letter.

370
00:19:08,993 --> 00:19:10,578
Easy, we're gonna get you fixed up.

371
00:19:10,745 --> 00:19:12,580
Four of MS and monitor
the foot pulses.

372
00:19:12,747 --> 00:19:15,916
We got at least four other criticals.
I'm not sure who's under there.

373
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:19,794
Loading pregnant lady and chest pain.
Working on the impaled girl. What else?

374
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,254
Okay, we got six dead over there.

375
00:19:22,421 --> 00:19:25,508
Also got another 15 noncriticals,
fractures and contusions.

376
00:19:25,675 --> 00:19:28,426
- We're only 8 minutes behind the call.
- Yeah?

377
00:19:28,593 --> 00:19:30,595
You assessed 25 patients
in eight minutes?

378
00:19:30,762 --> 00:19:33,764
- There's no paperwork out here.
- And Morris is with you, right?

379
00:19:33,931 --> 00:19:35,933
Send him to St. Rafe's,
he needs a banana bag.

380
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,435
Only the criticals go there,
the rest to Lakeview.

381
00:19:38,602 --> 00:19:39,811
St. Rafe's? Why not County?

382
00:19:39,977 --> 00:19:42,146
You guys closed the Trauma.
Got a call an hour ago.

383
00:19:42,313 --> 00:19:43,606
Whoa, this is a Level One.

384
00:19:43,773 --> 00:19:46,066
St. Rafe's can't take care
of patients like we can.

385
00:19:46,233 --> 00:19:49,778
If you can get County to open,
all the better. It's a lot closer.

386
00:19:51,571 --> 00:19:54,031
County General on two-bravo.

387
00:19:54,448 --> 00:19:57,243
Ray? You're with Rescue 56?

388
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:58,827
Our Ray?

389
00:19:58,993 --> 00:20:01,663
No, she's not here. Him either.

390
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,373
We got Abby.

391
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,124
Thanks.

392
00:20:07,084 --> 00:20:09,837
- Ray, what's going on?
- Porch collapse. Lots wounded.

393
00:20:10,003 --> 00:20:11,963
Five criticals.
We need you to open up.

394
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:14,924
- We only have one working O.R.
- They won't all need the O.R.

395
00:20:15,091 --> 00:20:16,467
It's mostly blunt trauma.

396
00:20:16,634 --> 00:20:18,802
Okay. We can accept one critical.

397
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:20,512
Come on, Abby. Take all five.

398
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:22,639
No, we're understaffed here.

399
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:26,142
- They might not make it anywhere else.
- We don't have any Attendings.

400
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,769
- You're a doctor, you can do this.
- No, no.

401
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,353
I have to run it by Kovac.

402
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,855
There isn't any time.

403
00:20:32,021 --> 00:20:33,731
The CPR guy's flatline.

404
00:20:33,898 --> 00:20:36,067
Okay, we are down to four criticals.

405
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:39,319
- Ray, I can't.
- Come on, County General.

406
00:20:39,486 --> 00:20:41,321
Will you accept these patients?

407
00:20:42,114 --> 00:20:43,906
Abby, you're being recorded,
you know.

408
00:20:44,073 --> 00:20:45,867
I know.

409
00:20:52,455 --> 00:20:54,833
Rescue 56,
we're taking four trauma patients.

410
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,459
You have blanket orders for IVs,
C- spine and O2.

411
00:20:57,626 --> 00:21:01,463
Thank you, County.
We are four minutes out.

412
00:21:03,548 --> 00:21:04,841
Okay.

413
00:21:05,008 --> 00:21:08,094
Okay, let's get patients out of Trauma,
Sutures and Curtain 2.

414
00:21:08,261 --> 00:21:12,639
Jerry, tell the O.R. to set up
another room. Chuny, page Kovac.

415
00:21:13,182 --> 00:21:15,142
Okay, listen up.

416
00:21:17,435 --> 00:21:19,937
Okay, first of all...

417
00:21:20,104 --> 00:21:23,565
...you should all eat and drink well
because the party's on Weaver.

418
00:21:23,732 --> 00:21:25,609
Now, that is a surprise.

419
00:21:25,775 --> 00:21:28,028
Guys on duty,
don't let me see beer in your hand.

420
00:21:28,195 --> 00:21:31,363
Hey, 11 years, couldn't we
spring for some caviar for the man?

421
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:33,199
Anyway...

422
00:21:34,158 --> 00:21:36,034
...there's something...

423
00:21:36,201 --> 00:21:40,038
...my father would say
when a friend went on a journey.

424
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:43,540
And...

425
00:21:43,707 --> 00:21:46,543
...he said it to me
when I came to the United States first.

426
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,089
So I thought of it today
when I realized...

427
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:54,591
...I wouldn't be working
with this guy anymore.

428
00:21:55,133 --> 00:21:57,802
Not for a long time, at least.

429
00:22:02,431 --> 00:22:07,310
My father would
clasp the person's hand...

430
00:22:07,518 --> 00:22:09,729
...and say:

431
00:22:12,065 --> 00:22:15,734
"We only part to meet again."

432
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:19,738
Hear, hear.

433
00:22:25,242 --> 00:22:26,826
Cheers.

434
00:22:27,327 --> 00:22:29,412
- Cheers.
- To Carter. Cheers, yes.

435
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:31,247
To the doc.

436
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,541
Burst eardrum, no Battle's sign.
When's her due date?

437
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:37,336
- May 29th.
- Tachy at 128 after a liter.

438
00:22:37,503 --> 00:22:40,046
- Systolic's only 84.
- All right, get her on her side.

439
00:22:40,213 --> 00:22:41,589
- One, two.
- What are you doing?

440
00:22:41,756 --> 00:22:43,966
- Same question.
- Supine hypotension syndrome.

441
00:22:44,133 --> 00:22:46,843
Uterus compresses the vena cava,
reducing cardiac output.

442
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:48,970
We're getting her blood pressure
back up.

443
00:22:49,137 --> 00:22:52,682
- You're okay, Molly. We've got you.
- My back.

444
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:57,228
- Does it hurt here?
- No.

445
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,856
All right. Those back pains,
they were contractions.

446
00:23:02,023 --> 00:23:04,983
- What? Now?
- Baby's crowning.

447
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,695
- Should I get a screen?
- No. Flip the bed.

448
00:23:07,861 --> 00:23:11,572
Get a warmer, a BOA Kit
and page OB.

449
00:23:13,533 --> 00:23:16,911
- BP's 80 palp.
- Ten blade. Chuny, everything okay?

450
00:23:17,078 --> 00:23:20,414
Baby's coming, mom's hypotensive
and we don't have fetal heart tones.

451
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,874
Well, a simple "no"
would have sufficed.

452
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:25,084
- Where's Kovac?
- On his way, I guess.

453
00:23:25,251 --> 00:23:27,378
- Doesn't he need an x-ray?
- Thirty-two French.

454
00:23:27,545 --> 00:23:29,547
He's unstable with evidence
of a hemothorax.

455
00:23:29,713 --> 00:23:33,049
- Tube first, ask questions later.
- Good. Systolic's up to a hundred.

456
00:23:33,216 --> 00:23:34,676
You did that test tube quick.

457
00:23:34,843 --> 00:23:37,219
O- neg on two pressure bags.
Set up for subclavian.

458
00:23:37,386 --> 00:23:39,680
- Are you the Senior Resident?
- No, I'm an intern.

459
00:23:39,847 --> 00:23:42,182
What you're gonna be in a few days.

460
00:23:43,891 --> 00:23:46,185
- BP is 110/76.
- How's Riley doing in there?

461
00:23:46,352 --> 00:23:48,062
- Need a central line.
- Is he okay?

462
00:23:48,229 --> 00:23:53,400
- Yeah, he will be. How's your throat?
- Little raw, all the yelling.

463
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:57,611
No dorsalis pedis. No posterior tib.

464
00:23:57,778 --> 00:24:00,573
- That doesn't sound good.
- You cut the artery in your foot.

465
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:03,700
- You need surgery, all right?
- We only called a few minutes ago.

466
00:24:03,867 --> 00:24:06,327
- I doubt the O.R.'s gonna be ready.
- No, they will be.

467
00:24:06,494 --> 00:24:07,704
Have them call us back...

468
00:24:07,871 --> 00:24:12,457
- ...as soon as they can.
- Off the phone. Go. Go. O.R.

469
00:24:12,624 --> 00:24:15,085
I called OB. They're in the middle
of a crash section.

470
00:24:15,252 --> 00:24:18,462
- There we go.
- Head's out, Mom. Lots of hair.

471
00:24:18,629 --> 00:24:21,132
- Molly, you're doing so good, baby.
- Suction.

472
00:24:24,259 --> 00:24:25,802
- Neela?
- Turtle sign.

473
00:24:25,969 --> 00:24:28,513
Jerry, 911 them.
Tell them we've got a shoulder.

474
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,432
- Shoulder dystocia.
- Is something wrong with our baby?

475
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:35,393
He's a bit big for your pelvis.
You can do this, Molly. Push again.

476
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,605
Really hard, okay? Pull her legs back.

477
00:24:38,771 --> 00:24:42,316
- Anterior shoulder is stuck.
- Supra-pubic pressure, hard as you can.

478
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:46,486
- Another big push, Mom. Come on.
- Molly, push again, all you've got.

479
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:48,738
- I can't.
- You can, Molly. I know you can.

480
00:24:48,905 --> 00:24:51,157
- Come on, baby.
- She can't, contraction's over.

481
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:54,243
- Fetal pulse is coming back up.
- All right.

482
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:57,370
All right, support her head. Right here.

483
00:24:57,537 --> 00:25:01,040
- I'll be back in a second.
- Wait, she's leaving? Why is she leaving?

484
00:25:01,206 --> 00:25:03,792
Abby, I've got a shoulder dystocia
and OB's MIA.

485
00:25:03,959 --> 00:25:06,587
- Did you try a Wood's screw maneuver?
- Never heard of it.

486
00:25:06,754 --> 00:25:10,131
That gives me satisfaction. I'm getting
a flash, I can't thread the wire.

487
00:25:10,298 --> 00:25:12,425
They need someone with experience.
I'll do this?

488
00:25:12,592 --> 00:25:13,842
- Okay.
- You're giving up?

489
00:25:14,009 --> 00:25:17,220
If you can't get a procedure after
the third attempt, you never will.

490
00:25:17,387 --> 00:25:20,223
- Is that from Tintinalli's book?
- No, the book of John Carter.

491
00:25:20,389 --> 00:25:22,975
- Heart beat's up to 140.
- This guy needs tons of volume.

492
00:25:23,142 --> 00:25:24,977
- Stay ahead four units.
- What's going on?

493
00:25:25,144 --> 00:25:27,979
- Mom's pressure's borderline.
- Baby decels with contractions.

494
00:25:28,146 --> 00:25:30,982
- Okay, hi. I'm Dr. Lockhart.
- Are you from OB?

495
00:25:31,149 --> 00:25:33,692
I used to be, yes. Okay.

496
00:25:33,859 --> 00:25:38,238
Let's see if we can
coax this little guy out, huh?

497
00:25:38,405 --> 00:25:40,490
- It's a girl.
- Her name's Janis.

498
00:25:40,657 --> 00:25:42,825
Janis. Okay.

499
00:25:43,993 --> 00:25:49,932
Okay, I'm going to rotate
Janis' posterior shoulder.

500
00:25:50,499 --> 00:25:54,001
Here comes another contraction.
Mom, come on, push.

501
00:25:56,212 --> 00:26:00,131
Flex the arms across the chest.
Come on. Big push, okay?

502
00:26:00,298 --> 00:26:03,718
- Baby's pulse is dropping again.
- In the 80s. Poor variability.

503
00:26:03,885 --> 00:26:06,428
All right. Come on, Molly, focus.
Really big push.

504
00:26:07,304 --> 00:26:11,058
- She's tiring out. Sats, 91.
- Okay. All right, all right, relax.

505
00:26:11,225 --> 00:26:13,184
Put her on oxygen.
Have O-neg standing by.

506
00:26:13,351 --> 00:26:15,895
- Someone asked me to bring you this.
- Did OB call back?

507
00:26:16,062 --> 00:26:18,480
Stuck in the O.R.
They said it'd be about 15 minutes.

508
00:26:18,647 --> 00:26:21,441
- How long ago was that?
- Eight minutes ago.

509
00:26:22,984 --> 00:26:25,027
- What about Luka?
- Want me to page him again?

510
00:26:25,194 --> 00:26:27,279
- No. All right, you.
- Me?

511
00:26:27,446 --> 00:26:29,573
- Yeah. You know where Ike Ryan's is?
- Yes.

512
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:32,492
Get over there, find Kovac
and bring him back here, fast.

513
00:26:32,701 --> 00:26:34,828
Okay, we can't wait,
not with the late decels.

514
00:26:34,994 --> 00:26:37,247
- Betadine, lido and a 10 blade.
- Get her out!

515
00:26:37,955 --> 00:26:39,873
You're doing a section by yourself?

516
00:26:40,791 --> 00:26:42,042
Where the hell is Luka?

517
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:48,131
I only needed one more shot.

518
00:26:48,297 --> 00:26:51,216
- I got lucky.
- Three times in a row?

519
00:26:51,383 --> 00:26:53,718
You guys just missed
Kovac running the table on me.

520
00:26:53,885 --> 00:26:55,679
I've heard Kovac cheats.

521
00:26:55,846 --> 00:26:58,264
Yeah, I didn't even know
they played pool in Croatia.

522
00:26:58,431 --> 00:27:01,892
Sure, but we just use broomsticks
and goat testicles.

523
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:03,643
- Get out of here.
- No, it's hard.

524
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:05,645
Those balls don't roll straight.

525
00:27:06,646 --> 00:27:10,482
Alrighty then. On that note,
I'm gonna take the young man home.

526
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,734
Greg.

527
00:27:13,819 --> 00:27:15,571
- Take care of yourself.
- Thank you.

528
00:27:15,737 --> 00:27:18,531
- For everything.
- Anytime.

529
00:27:18,698 --> 00:27:21,576
All right, and I'll see you suckers later.
Enjoy yourselves.

530
00:27:21,742 --> 00:27:23,326
See you.

531
00:27:24,369 --> 00:27:26,538
- Got your toast ready?
- Yeah.

532
00:27:26,705 --> 00:27:28,748
Gotta say something, don't you?

533
00:27:28,915 --> 00:27:32,793
- Do I?
- Oh, yeah. Definitely.

534
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:36,754
Let me go lick my wounds first.
I'll be right back.

535
00:27:42,467 --> 00:27:45,721
- Dr. Lewis said wait till she gets here.
- When's that gonna be?

536
00:27:45,888 --> 00:27:49,098
She's on the overnight.
She's gonna stop by on her way in.

537
00:27:50,266 --> 00:27:52,935
Who's-? Who's Kovac?

538
00:27:54,437 --> 00:27:57,022
- Neela, talk to me.
- Porch collapse in Wrigleyville.

539
00:27:57,189 --> 00:28:00,650
- I know. Tell me about the patient.
- Chest trauma, two liters out the left.

540
00:28:00,817 --> 00:28:04,945
- We're doing a cutdown. Ray?
- Open it up to the femoral sheath.

541
00:28:07,573 --> 00:28:12,202
This is the fastest way to resuscitate
a peri-arrest patient. Right?

542
00:28:12,368 --> 00:28:15,871
That's right. Looks good.
Run the level one.

543
00:28:16,455 --> 00:28:19,374
Do you know Abby's doing
a symphysiotomy in here?

544
00:28:22,293 --> 00:28:25,004
By dissecting the ligaments
connecting the pubic bone...

545
00:28:25,171 --> 00:28:28,173
...you can get up to three more
centimeters of pelvic space.

546
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:31,635
- Fetal tracing is holding in the 90s.
- Feels like we opened up a bit.

547
00:28:31,801 --> 00:28:35,971
- So next contraction, big push, okay?
- Okay.

548
00:28:36,138 --> 00:28:37,473
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

549
00:28:38,557 --> 00:28:41,976
All right, come on, Molly.
Come on, Molly, push.

550
00:28:43,561 --> 00:28:45,647
- Push.
- Here she comes.

551
00:28:45,813 --> 00:28:51,151
And the anterior shoulder is out.

552
00:28:52,736 --> 00:28:55,279
Suction. And clamp.

553
00:28:58,032 --> 00:28:59,824
Scissors to Dad.

554
00:29:08,123 --> 00:29:09,625
Hey, big girl.

555
00:29:25,179 --> 00:29:28,599
Hi, Janis. Hi.

556
00:29:28,766 --> 00:29:31,018
Congratulations. She's a beauty.

557
00:29:43,195 --> 00:29:45,446
- So how's school?
- It's all right.

558
00:29:45,613 --> 00:29:47,407
You doing okay?

559
00:29:48,324 --> 00:29:50,576
Well, you know, I'm pretty damn good
with science.

560
00:29:50,743 --> 00:29:53,203
So if you ever need a hand
just give me a call.

561
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:56,873
Thanks. I got it from here.

562
00:30:01,085 --> 00:30:03,962
Hey, Dad. Hey, Dad, come on,
let's go inside.

563
00:30:07,882 --> 00:30:10,176
- Oh, man.
- Here, I'm gonna help you up.

564
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:12,428
- K.J., go put some coffee on.
- It's okay.

565
00:30:12,594 --> 00:30:16,056
Don't worry, I got him.
Go ahead. Go inside there.

566
00:30:16,223 --> 00:30:19,308
Come on, man. Let's go. Come on.
Come on, man. Get up.

567
00:30:19,475 --> 00:30:21,310
You know how to walk.

568
00:30:21,894 --> 00:30:26,189
- Come on, sit down.
- He giving you any trouble, man?

569
00:30:26,356 --> 00:30:31,068
- Go ahead. Yeah, go get the coffee.
- Getting a little older, thinks he's smart.

570
00:30:31,235 --> 00:30:33,571
Don't give him no excuse
to give any lip, though.

571
00:30:33,737 --> 00:30:35,865
How come
you didn't pick him up, man?

572
00:30:37,198 --> 00:30:38,450
Damn. What time is it?

573
00:30:38,616 --> 00:30:41,828
He was waiting on you, D.
You never showed up. Where were you?

574
00:30:43,328 --> 00:30:47,082
Hey, listen. You his father.
You understand that?

575
00:30:47,249 --> 00:30:49,333
The only one he's got.

576
00:30:51,502 --> 00:30:53,671
Oh, man.

577
00:31:01,386 --> 00:31:03,220
- Systolic's up to 110.
- Where's Dubenko?

578
00:31:03,387 --> 00:31:05,556
- He's getting the O.R. ready.
- Jessica's ex-lap?

579
00:31:05,723 --> 00:31:08,641
The impaled girl? Anspaugh took her
up to Surgery. She's stable.

580
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,769
Ray, he's getting stridorous.

581
00:31:13,062 --> 00:31:16,023
Okay. Sit tight, Riley.
I'll check up on you in a bit, okay?

582
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:18,859
All right, come get me
if he decompensates.

583
00:31:19,067 --> 00:31:22,445
- How's your breathing, man?
- Little rough.

584
00:31:23,529 --> 00:31:26,657
Hello, Dr. Neela. You missed the party.

585
00:31:27,782 --> 00:31:30,160
How are you doing, Nick?

586
00:31:30,702 --> 00:31:33,830
Sorry. There's crepitus.

587
00:31:33,996 --> 00:31:35,998
I had a dream like this.

588
00:31:37,124 --> 00:31:41,294
- Only Ray wasn't with us.
- C-spine's clear. Losing the collar.

589
00:31:41,461 --> 00:31:45,798
- Pulse ox, 90 on 5 liters.
- Twenty of etomidate, 120 sux.

590
00:31:48,425 --> 00:31:49,927
Hello?

591
00:31:50,761 --> 00:31:52,638
Yeah, speaking.

592
00:31:54,096 --> 00:31:58,809
My credit card?
No. It hasn't been stolen.

593
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,560
Alex?

594
00:32:10,611 --> 00:32:11,862
Alex!

595
00:32:13,404 --> 00:32:16,407
I'd like to thank you all
for coming tonight.

596
00:32:19,284 --> 00:32:23,789
I consider myself a lucky man.

597
00:32:23,956 --> 00:32:28,459
Yeah, "lucky man." That's good.
Who are you, Lou Gehrig?

598
00:32:39,051 --> 00:32:40,969
It's been...

599
00:32:42,221 --> 00:32:44,181
...11 years.

600
00:32:48,726 --> 00:32:53,689
I feel like I grew up here
with all of you.

601
00:33:10,328 --> 00:33:11,620
Where did everybody go?

602
00:33:11,787 --> 00:33:15,124
Work. They said they'd be back.

603
00:33:19,293 --> 00:33:21,421
Are you new in the ER?

604
00:33:21,629 --> 00:33:25,424
Geriatrics. Heard there was free food.

605
00:33:31,846 --> 00:33:33,973
I like you with the beard.

606
00:34:02,329 --> 00:34:06,167
- Keep an eye on the sats, all right?
- All right. I'll check your crit in Angio.

607
00:34:07,084 --> 00:34:10,879
- Symphysiotomy, huh?
- Healthy girl. Eight pounds, 10 ounces.

608
00:34:11,045 --> 00:34:12,630
Dr. Barnett,
I was told you demanded...

609
00:34:12,797 --> 00:34:14,966
...we not take any patients
before the tib-fib guy.

610
00:34:15,132 --> 00:34:18,468
I reprioritized. Take Neela's patient first,
my guy can wait.

611
00:34:24,891 --> 00:34:28,101
They took me to Lakeview.
I couldn't find a taxi.

612
00:34:28,268 --> 00:34:30,437
- What do you guys need?
- We're all good, Morris.

613
00:34:30,604 --> 00:34:32,814
Really? You sure?

614
00:34:32,981 --> 00:34:35,065
I'm gonna go lie down.

615
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:43,948
Hey, you guys all ditched Carter.

616
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:46,451
He was hugging some huge orderly
when I got there.

617
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:48,827
- We got it under control now.
- Well, that's good.

618
00:34:48,994 --> 00:34:52,748
Cosmo's been screaming like a banshee.
I intend to spend my shift sleeping.

619
00:34:52,915 --> 00:34:55,458
Carter, your volleyball girl's
ready for the reduction.

620
00:34:55,625 --> 00:34:58,461
- It's okay, I'll get it.
- I'll take it. One more for the road.

621
00:34:58,628 --> 00:35:01,254
- How long are you here?
- Just have to pick up some stuff.

622
00:35:01,421 --> 00:35:03,798
- How about you?
- I'm off as soon as you're ready.

623
00:35:03,965 --> 00:35:05,800
How does "never" sound?

624
00:35:07,009 --> 00:35:12,139
Luka. Luka. Did you hear from Alex?
Is he here?

625
00:35:12,306 --> 00:35:14,599
Why do I have to hang my hand
from these things?

626
00:35:14,766 --> 00:35:17,810
- Janell, manners.
- So that I can realign your bones.

627
00:35:17,977 --> 00:35:22,731
- Hello. I'm Dr. Carter.
- Clyde Parkerson. My wife, Eva.

628
00:35:22,898 --> 00:35:25,567
I'm sure that Janell told you
she broke her wrist.

629
00:35:25,734 --> 00:35:27,610
A.k. a. Colles' fracture.

630
00:35:27,777 --> 00:35:31,155
- And we gave her a local anesthesia.
- A.k. a. hematoma block.

631
00:35:31,989 --> 00:35:34,407
And that she has a future in medicine,
it would seem.

632
00:35:34,574 --> 00:35:35,825
A.k. a. I'll be rich.

633
00:35:35,992 --> 00:35:38,203
- I'll give you countertraction.
- Okay.

634
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:41,455
Dr. Carter, do you remember us?

635
00:35:46,042 --> 00:35:47,293
I'm sorry, I don't.

636
00:35:49,337 --> 00:35:50,755
Cast padding.

637
00:35:50,922 --> 00:35:54,341
- I was a patient here in 1994.
- Really?

638
00:35:54,508 --> 00:35:56,802
We went into premature labor
at 32 weeks.

639
00:35:56,969 --> 00:35:59,095
There was no time to get me
to the OB floor...

640
00:35:59,261 --> 00:36:03,974
...so I gave birth here in the ER.
You delivered her.

641
00:36:11,146 --> 00:36:13,941
- I did?
- Yes, you did.

642
00:36:14,733 --> 00:36:16,485
Cool.

643
00:36:19,404 --> 00:36:21,072
Two-inch roll.

644
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:27,327
- Can I have the purple cast?
- Whatever you want.

645
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:33,249
- He must have gone through my purse.
- Tried to buy a bus ticket?

646
00:36:33,416 --> 00:36:36,252
They wouldn't let him. He took off
while they called the cops.

647
00:36:36,419 --> 00:36:39,129
- Probably went to a friend's apartment.
- I called them all.

648
00:36:39,295 --> 00:36:40,505
What did the police say?

649
00:36:40,672 --> 00:36:43,091
They said to wait at home
while they're searching...

650
00:36:43,257 --> 00:36:45,843
...but I'm not gonna sit,
I have to go try to find him.

651
00:36:46,009 --> 00:36:49,346
- What if he shows up at the apartment?
- Erica's there. She's gonna stay.

652
00:36:49,513 --> 00:36:52,098
How much cash did he get?

653
00:36:52,265 --> 00:36:54,308
About 80, maybe a hundred,
I don't know.

654
00:36:54,475 --> 00:36:57,853
- He's pissed. He's walking it off.
- He tried to buy a ticket to Colorado.

655
00:36:58,019 --> 00:37:00,939
He's gonna do whatever he can
to see Steve. He's not gonna stop.

656
00:37:01,106 --> 00:37:03,983
He doesn't have his Glucometer.
He doesn't have his syringes.

657
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:06,902
- He doesn't have his insulin.
- Sam, Sam, Sam, hey, hey, hey.

658
00:37:07,069 --> 00:37:10,321
He'll be okay for the next 12 hours.
We'll find him way before then.

659
00:37:10,488 --> 00:37:12,282
Let me get my jacket.

660
00:37:13,366 --> 00:37:16,869
Hey, Luka, will you-?
Will you get some NPH from lockup?

661
00:37:17,035 --> 00:37:19,830
And some D5
and some D10 too, okay?

662
00:37:19,997 --> 00:37:21,457
Okay.

663
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:45,560
I'll get it.

664
00:37:53,066 --> 00:37:56,527
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm looking for Charlie Pratt.

665
00:37:57,778 --> 00:38:01,448
- I know you?
- Your name is Charlie Pratt?

666
00:38:02,824 --> 00:38:03,867
Yeah.

667
00:38:06,411 --> 00:38:10,664
- I'm sorry, I must have got it wrong.
- Chaz, who is it?

668
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,919
Is there a problem?

669
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:20,214
- Are you Charlie?
- Are you a bill collector?

670
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:25,719
Then, yeah, I'm Charlie.

671
00:38:28,095 --> 00:38:29,639
I'm an ER doc over at County.

672
00:38:29,805 --> 00:38:33,391
- Is somebody sick?
- No. No, nothing like that.

673
00:38:33,558 --> 00:38:35,560
I got your name from the folks
at Ceasefire.

674
00:38:35,727 --> 00:38:37,312
Couldn't wait till morning?

675
00:38:39,064 --> 00:38:41,774
I'm gonna be there tomorrow
for a meeting anyway.

676
00:38:45,444 --> 00:38:47,612
You're right. It can wait.

677
00:38:48,404 --> 00:38:50,198
You all right, son?

678
00:38:55,202 --> 00:38:56,787
Yeah, I'm okay.

679
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,622
Maybe you ought to come in.

680
00:39:02,416 --> 00:39:04,543
Sorry if I disturbed you.

681
00:39:10,799 --> 00:39:15,052
Did I spell symphysiotomy right?

682
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:17,471
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

683
00:39:22,141 --> 00:39:24,810
- How's your friend?
- Missed the aorta.

684
00:39:24,976 --> 00:39:28,814
Anspaugh fixed her up.
Jessica's gonna be fine.

685
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:33,984
You look tired. You should go home.

686
00:39:34,151 --> 00:39:36,112
I wanna be here
when my friends wake up.

687
00:39:37,529 --> 00:39:41,157
All right, then.
Help yourself to a chart.

688
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,377
Dr. Carter.

689
00:39:54,544 --> 00:39:58,463
I was just on my way out.
Thought I'd stop by.

690
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:03,008
- Sorry we missed the party.
- You weren't the only ones.

691
00:40:04,051 --> 00:40:06,804
So I just found this in my locker.

692
00:40:07,096 --> 00:40:09,348
It has been in there
for a very long time.

693
00:40:09,514 --> 00:40:15,103
And, to be honest, I haven't given it
much thought for many years.

694
00:40:16,437 --> 00:40:17,855
Not since Mark died.

695
00:40:19,898 --> 00:40:21,692
When you interned for Dr. Greene...

696
00:40:21,859 --> 00:40:24,777
...he would have everybody
write a letter to themselves...

697
00:40:24,944 --> 00:40:28,322
...that they wouldn't open
until their very last day of Residency.

698
00:40:28,822 --> 00:40:31,324
So that's your letter to yourself?

699
00:40:33,535 --> 00:40:34,744
What does it say?

700
00:40:37,204 --> 00:40:39,206
It says...

701
00:40:41,875 --> 00:40:43,710
...that I'm scared.

702
00:40:44,836 --> 00:40:47,547
And that I know I have a lot to learn.

703
00:40:49,047 --> 00:40:50,883
And I hope I learn it quickly.

704
00:40:52,926 --> 00:40:55,386
And that I pray to God
that I don't kill anybody.

705
00:40:57,221 --> 00:41:01,141
And it says that if I'm good at this...

706
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:07,230
...and I can stick it out
and become an Attending...

707
00:41:08,772 --> 00:41:12,568
...well, that will be all I ever need.

708
00:41:24,912 --> 00:41:27,079
I got a plane to catch.

709
00:41:31,292 --> 00:41:36,254
One day you'll look up,
and maybe 10 years will have passed.

710
00:41:36,421 --> 00:41:40,424
Carter,
you're gonna make a good doctor.

711
00:41:40,591 --> 00:41:44,595
Carter, you gotta hurry it up.
You got a million things to do.

712
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:48,473
You set the tone, Carter.

713
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:05,029
- Morris?
- I think I might puke again.

714
00:42:09,032 --> 00:42:11,493
You set the tone, Morris.

715
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,874
Never mind.

716
00:42:29,424 --> 00:42:31,300
- What's that?
- My contract.

717
00:42:31,467 --> 00:42:35,388
Oh, okay, then I guess you have
some more writing to do.

718
00:42:36,806 --> 00:42:38,723
It's good enough for Carter.

719
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:48,232
Think it's weird if I put, "Dear Neela"?

720
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:51,109
Hey, Erica, any word?

721
00:42:51,275 --> 00:42:54,570
Did Bobby's mom call back?
He wasn't with him?

722
00:42:56,239 --> 00:42:59,449
Okay. Yeah, it's gonna be all right.

723
00:43:00,784 --> 00:43:02,911
What about Navy Pier?
He likes the rides there.

724
00:43:03,078 --> 00:43:06,414
- It's after 11, it's closed.
- What about your phone, is it charged?

725
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:11,126
Sam. Sam. It's all gonna be okay.
