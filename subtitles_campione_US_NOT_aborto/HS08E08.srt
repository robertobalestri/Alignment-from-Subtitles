00:00:00,694 --> 00:00:02,578
And you're sure he didn't
leave until after 9:00?

2
00:00:02,579 --> 00:00:04,077
Absolutely.
We watched

3
00:00:04,145 --> 00:00:05,411
the Devils demolish
the Rangers.

- <i>We stayed at my place.</i>

7
00:00:11,696 --> 00:00:12,996
We were together
the whole time.

8
00:00:13,064 --> 00:00:15,504
And you said the Devils won?
- <i>Yup. 4-zip.</i>

9
00:00:15,572 --> 00:00:17,740
<i>Kovalchuk had two,</i>
<i>Arnott and Parise each had one,</i>

10
00:00:17,807 --> 00:00:19,577
and Marty got the shutout.

11
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:21,615
I'm sorry.
Marty?

12
00:00:21,683 --> 00:00:23,884
Martin Brodeur.

13
00:00:23,952 --> 00:00:26,757
Devils' starting goalie
for, like, the past 20 years.

14
00:00:26,824 --> 00:00:28,629
<i>He played awesome</i>
<i>as usual.</i>

15
00:00:28,697 --> 00:00:31,300
Your Honor,
may I submit the sports page

16
00:00:31,367 --> 00:00:34,271

00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,908
Objection.

18
00:00:35,976 --> 00:00:37,243

credibility.

19
00:00:37,311 --> 00:00:38,346
Go quickly.

20
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,755
Would you please read

21
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:49,094
"Martin Brodeur stops 1

22

to a shutout victory."

23
00:00:53,034 --> 00:00:55,137
That's what I just said.

24
00:00:55,204 --> 00:00:57,773
That the defendant couldn't have
possibly committed the robbery

25
00:00:57,841 --> 00:00:59,074
because he was with you

26
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,743
watching Martin Brodeur
shut out the Rangers.

27
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:01,911
Yes.

28
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,879
Thank you.

29
00:01:03,947 --> 00:01:07,116

31
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,518
Your Honor.

32
00:01:09,586 --> 00:01:10,687
This is what you call
going quickly?

33
00:01:10,754 --> 00:01:12,657
Just two more questions.
I promise.

34
00:01:14,294 --> 00:01:19,566
Please read the highlighted text
at the bottom of the page.

35
00:01:19,634 --> 00:01:21,802

40
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:45,498
An understandable mistake.

41
00:01:45,566 --> 00:01:48,402
Given that Martin Brodeur
was scheduled to start

42
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:49,937
but bowed out

43
00:01:50,004 --> 00:01:52,974
after taking a shot
to the throat in warm-up.

44
00:01:53,042 --> 00:01:56,512
Which brings me
to my most relevant question.

45
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,316
Did you and the defendant spend
the evening of October 8th

46
00:02:00,384 --> 00:02:02,519
watching the Devils game
on TV,

47
00:02:02,587 --> 00:02:04,588
<i>or did you just read</i>
<i>about the game in the</i> Chronicle

48
00:02:04,656 --> 00:02:07,224

this false alibi?

49
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:12,998

<i>I, um...</i>

Excuse me,
Your Honor,

52
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:16,569
may I approach?

53
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:17,704
You sure you don't want
to wait

54
00:02:17,772 --> 00:02:19,206
till after he answers
your question?

55
00:02:19,274 --> 00:02:21,676
No.

56
00:02:21,743 --> 00:02:23,978
I'm gonna need
a continuance.

57
00:02:24,046 --> 00:02:25,112
Now?

58
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,380
You're one answer away
from destroying

59
00:02:26,448 --> 00:02:27,448
their whole defense.

60
00:02:27,516 --> 00:02:28,349
- Come on.
- Oh, shut up.

61
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:29,550
You know it's true.

62
00:02:29,618 --> 00:02:31,251
- Let's finish this up.
- I can't.

63
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,920
Why the hell not?

64
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:38,358
Because I think
I'm having a heart attack.

65

No improvements.

85
00:03:46,767 --> 00:03:48,734
Because...
Because for some patients

86
00:03:48,802 --> 00:03:50,403
the diagnosis
of anxiety disorder

87
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:52,973
can actually increase anxiety,

88
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,642
which is also why I told him

89
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:56,010
he had
a minor respiratory infection

90
00:03:56,078 --> 00:03:58,212

by the medication.

91
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,580
You lied?

92
00:03:59,648 --> 00:04:02,250
I ruled out heart attack
and anxiety disorder.

93
00:04:02,317 --> 00:04:05,219
Interesting.

94
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:09,223
I know.

95
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:13,994
Impressive.

96
00:04:14,061 --> 00:04:17,198
What, the wiliness

97
00:04:17,265 --> 00:04:19,733

ruled out anxiety

98
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:23,238
or his complete
wiliness-less-ness

99
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:24,739
before he met me?

100
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:25,673
The fact that you managed

101
00:04:25,741 --> 00:04:26,907
to smear jelly

102
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,809
on nearly every page.

103
00:04:28,877 --> 00:04:31,612
Shingles could cause chest pain
before a rash appeared.

104
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,848
Pain would be restricted
to one dermatome.

105
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,183
It wouldn't cross them.

106
00:04:35,251 --> 00:04:37,151
Asthma-induced pneumothorax

108

No history of asthma.

109
00:04:40,756 --> 00:04:42,590
They did a lateral view
as well.

110
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:43,892
No sign
of a pneumothorax

111
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,360
or deep sulcus sign.

112
00:04:45,428 --> 00:04:47,696
I treated an inmate once
with similar symptoms

113
00:04:47,764 --> 00:04:50,031
after he tried to poison
his cellmate with chlorine gas.

114
00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:52,967
He didn't realize sharing a cell
also meant sharing the air?

115
00:04:53,035 --> 00:04:54,568
<i>Chlorine gas pools</i>
<i>near the ground</i>

116
00:04:54,636 --> 00:04:56,337
he thought he'd be safe
in the top bunk.

117
00:04:56,404 --> 00:04:57,738
Well, why would anyone try
to poison our guy?

118
00:04:57,806 --> 00:04:58,605
<i>He makes a living</i>

119
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,407
<i>sending people to prison.</i>

120
00:05:00,475 --> 00:05:01,875
But he's not in prison,
and it's kind of hard

121
00:05:01,943 --> 00:05:04,778
to gas a guy unless you can seal
him in a room first.

122
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,580
Which is why Arceus
created a universe

123
00:05:06,648 --> 00:05:08,749
<i>with 3 states of matter</i>

124
00:05:08,816 --> 00:05:11,084
and 300 solid
or liquid poisons

125
00:05:11,152 --> 00:05:12,185
that could cause
his symptoms.

126
00:05:12,253 --> 00:05:14,721
Arceus?

127
00:05:14,789 --> 00:05:18,625
Look it up.
And alkalinize his urine.

128
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:19,960
Go search his home,
talk to his wife,

129
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,495
see if you can get her
to tell us what she used.

130
00:05:21,563 --> 00:05:24,699
Wait, why would you think
his wife poisoned him?

131
00:05:24,767 --> 00:05:26,968
Because dangerous people
don't break into your home,

132
00:05:27,036 --> 00:05:28,202
they live in it.

133
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,570
<i>And although his kids</i>
<i>are old enough</i>

134
00:05:29,638 --> 00:05:30,938

they're still to young

135
00:05:31,006 --> 00:05:32,040
to do anything about it.

136
00:05:32,107 --> 00:05:33,174
<i>Must be such a pleasure</i>

137
00:05:33,242 --> 00:05:34,709
to live in your head.

138
00:05:34,777 --> 00:05:36,244
You're right.

139
00:05:36,311 --> 00:05:37,512
Kids might be precocious.

140
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,913
You handle his house.

141
00:05:38,981 --> 00:05:40,515
You handle him and his wife.

142
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,484
They get to just hang out
and do nothing?

143
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:45,019
If you need help,
you can take whoever you want.

144
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,754
- I'll take Taub.
- I'll take Taub.

145
00:05:48,991 --> 00:05:50,658
Interesting.
<i>No, it's not.</i>

146
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:52,926
It was a 50/50 choice.

147
00:05:52,994 --> 00:05:54,428

150
00:06:01,035 --> 00:06:02,001
That was fun.

151
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:04,369
Not really.

152
00:06:08,941 --> 00:06:10,709
Nice move, boss.

153
00:06:10,777 --> 00:06:12,110
Lying to the patient.

154
00:06:12,178 --> 00:06:13,345
I had no choice.

155
00:06:13,413 --> 00:06:14,413
I knew
House wouldn't take the case

156
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,614
unless I ruled out anxiety.

157
00:06:15,682 --> 00:06:16,815
You need a girlfriend.

158
00:06:16,883 --> 00:06:18,583
To keep me
from lying to patients?

159
00:06:18,651 --> 00:06:20,218
To give you the excitement
you need

160
00:06:20,286 --> 00:06:21,420
so you don't go looking
for it.

161
00:06:21,488 --> 00:06:22,688
You're not working
for House anymore,

162
00:06:22,756 --> 00:06:24,190
which means
you no longer have him

163
00:06:24,257 --> 00:06:25,458
to blame
if you get caught.

164
00:06:25,526 --> 00:06:26,760
I'm not looking
for excitement.

165
00:06:26,827 --> 00:06:27,761
I'm doing my job,
part of which

166
00:06:27,829 --> 00:06:30,497
is to make sure
House does his.

167
00:06:30,565 --> 00:06:32,533
Girlfriend might not be
so bad.

168
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,636
It's less dangerous
than where you're headed.

169
00:06:34,704 --> 00:06:36,871
And that's from a guy
with one alimony

170
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:38,440
and two child support payments.

171
00:06:51,722 --> 00:06:53,490
It's this new curve control
thing.

172
00:06:53,558 --> 00:06:55,492
It automatically slows
the car

173
00:06:55,559 --> 00:06:57,761
when it senses
I'm taking a curve too fast.

174
00:06:57,828 --> 00:07:00,396
You really think
I care about your car?

175
00:07:00,464 --> 00:07:01,864
Or are you just trying
to avoid talking

176
00:07:01,932 --> 00:07:03,299
about why you don't like
working with me?

177
00:07:03,367 --> 00:07:05,201
There's nothing to talk about.

178
00:07:05,269 --> 00:07:07,036
House liked poking ant hills

179
00:07:07,104 --> 00:07:08,604
with a stick
when he was a kid,

180
00:07:08,672 --> 00:07:10,272
<i>and now he wants</i>
<i>to do the same with us.</i>

181
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,574
House is an ass,
but he's an intuitive ass.

182
00:07:12,642 --> 00:07:14,543
He obviously noticed something.

183
00:07:14,611 --> 00:07:17,212
Yeah, the fact
that we work well together.

184
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,249
He thrives on conflict and is
looking for someone to torment.

185
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:22,851
Don't let it be us.

186
00:07:26,255 --> 00:07:27,823
<i>I don't see</i>
<i>how that's possible.</i>

187
00:07:27,891 --> 00:07:31,227
Tommy's the most popular guy
in his office.

188
00:07:31,295 --> 00:07:33,129
He's even had defendants
thank him

189
00:07:33,196 --> 00:07:35,364
after they were sentenced.
Why would they thank him?

190
00:07:35,432 --> 00:07:37,233
Because he doesn't treat them
like scum.

191
00:07:37,301 --> 00:07:39,202
He makes them feel
like he's helping

192
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,904
by offering a plea
or even just by letting them

193
00:07:40,972 --> 00:07:42,707
pay their debt
and clear their conscience.

194
00:07:42,774 --> 00:07:44,609
And even if someone wanted
to poison him,

195
00:07:44,676 --> 00:07:46,177
I don't see
how they would do it.

196
00:07:46,245 --> 00:07:49,614
He never eats or drinks anything
that we haven't made at home.

197
00:07:49,682 --> 00:07:51,749
Wait.
You mean literally?

198
00:07:51,817 --> 00:07:52,717
Like, not even a bottle
of water?

199
00:07:52,785 --> 00:07:53,952
No.

200
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,721
So he was obviously
afraid of something.

201
00:07:56,789 --> 00:07:59,558
Yeah, rats,
mice, cockroaches.

202
00:07:59,626 --> 00:08:01,194
My first job out of law school

203
00:08:01,261 --> 00:08:03,163
was at the health department.

204
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,764
If you'd have seen
some of the kitchens

205
00:08:04,832 --> 00:08:06,232
or the processing plants
I have,

206
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,768
you'd cook
all your own food too.

207
00:08:08,835 --> 00:08:10,436
<i>Poison wouldn't have</i>
<i>to be in food.</i>

208
00:08:10,504 --> 00:08:13,005
Have you gotten
any strange letters

209
00:08:13,073 --> 00:08:14,006
or packages
recently?

210
00:08:14,074 --> 00:08:16,108
No.

211
00:08:16,175 --> 00:08:19,744
You also wouldn't have
to be at work.

212
00:08:19,812 --> 00:08:21,278
We've got two young kids.

213
00:08:21,346 --> 00:08:23,047
There's definitely
no poisons

214
00:08:23,114 --> 00:08:24,682
I could have accidentally
been exposed to at home.

215
00:08:27,018 --> 00:08:29,152
What if it wasn't an accident?

216
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,054
How are things
between you and your wife?

217
00:08:32,589 --> 00:08:35,324
Are you asking me
if I think

218
00:08:35,392 --> 00:08:36,992
my wife is trying
to kill me?

219
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:40,061
Yes, I am.

220
00:08:40,129 --> 00:08:42,997
Absolutely not.

221
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:44,265
This is coming
from a man

222
00:08:44,332 --> 00:08:45,600
whose eyes
are wide open.

223
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:48,402
I have prosecuted hundreds
of despicable acts

224
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,704
by husbands, wives,

225
00:08:49,772 --> 00:08:51,039
parents.

226
00:08:51,107 --> 00:08:52,107
I can assure you...

227
00:08:52,175 --> 00:08:53,575
I love my husband,

228
00:08:53,643 --> 00:08:56,178
and I would not ever
even for a second

229
00:08:56,246 --> 00:08:58,148
consider doing anything
to hurt him.

230
00:08:58,215 --> 00:09:00,383
No pesticides,

231
00:09:00,451 --> 00:09:03,386
fertilizers,
or fuel in the garage.

232
00:09:03,454 --> 00:09:04,521
You find anything?

233
00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:05,889
No, there's not even a bottle

234
00:09:05,957 --> 00:09:07,825
of wite-out in this place.

235
00:09:07,893 --> 00:09:09,126
Maybe we should look again.

236
00:09:09,194 --> 00:09:12,162
Maybe we should leave
before the police get here.

237
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,730
Well, even if a neighbor
saw us break in

238
00:09:13,798 --> 00:09:16,066
and called 911,
unless they said we were armed,

239
00:09:16,133 --> 00:09:18,134
it's low priority.
We've got another five minutes.

240
00:09:18,202 --> 00:09:19,168
<i>He's a prosecutor.</i>

241
00:09:19,236 --> 00:09:20,836
Obviously he knows
a lot of cops.

242
00:09:20,904 --> 00:09:23,672
His house is not gonna be
low priority.

243
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,974
Good point.

244
00:09:26,042 --> 00:09:28,243
Wait.

245
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,315
The dining room's
on the other side of that wall.

246
00:09:33,383 --> 00:09:34,717
<i>Yeah, so?</i>

247
00:09:34,784 --> 00:09:38,487
But it ends,
like, three feet further over.

248
00:09:38,554 --> 00:09:40,021
You've got to be kidding me.

249
00:09:40,089 --> 00:09:41,990
A second ago,
you wanted to run like hell,

250
00:09:42,058 --> 00:09:47,228
<i>and now you want</i>
<i>to look for secret passages?</i>

251
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:48,763
There's a magnet
on the fridge

252
00:09:48,831 --> 00:09:50,599
they use to open
child-proofed cabinets.

253
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:51,500
Go get it.

254
00:09:53,069 --> 00:09:54,503
Hurry up.

255
00:10:02,245 --> 00:10:03,879
Here.

256
00:10:10,387 --> 00:10:12,855
Holy crap.

257
00:10:25,201 --> 00:10:26,902
Don't tell me.

258
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:30,006
The jealous wife
in the dining room

259
00:10:30,073 --> 00:10:33,643
with bipyridyl herbicide.

260
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:38,314
<i>We didn't find any poisons.</i>

261
00:10:38,382 --> 00:10:39,716
Well, you obviously found
something.

262
00:10:39,784 --> 00:10:41,818
Yeah.

263
00:10:41,885 --> 00:10:45,021
A hidden bunker with enough guns
to defend Fort Knox.

264
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:47,924
Or break into it.

265
00:10:49,761 --> 00:10:51,428
Cool.

266
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,229
That's impossible. You must have
broken into the wrong house.

267
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,764
Then you have
creepy neighbors,

268
00:10:57,832 --> 00:10:59,567
because there were photos
of you and your kids all over.

269
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:03,571
I don't understand.

270
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:05,406
<i>How could this...</i>

271
00:11:07,276 --> 00:11:10,511
I had it put in
during the remodel last year.

272
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:12,414
But we went over the plans
together.

273
00:11:12,481 --> 00:11:15,149
It's not in the plans.

274
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:17,252
I didn't want
the city to know about it.

275
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,788
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

276
00:11:19,856 --> 00:11:21,156
I should have told you.

277
00:11:21,224 --> 00:11:23,325
I just...

278
00:11:23,393 --> 00:11:25,593
I didn't want you and the kids
to worry.

279
00:11:25,661 --> 00:11:29,097
About what?

280
00:11:29,165 --> 00:11:30,532
Tommy, what is it?
Why would you think

281
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,501
you needed so many guns?

282
00:11:39,976 --> 00:11:41,009
You're not gonna believe this.

283
00:11:41,077 --> 00:11:45,246
<i>Imperio absenti chaos regit.</i>

284
00:11:45,314 --> 00:11:48,550
He's worried that "too big
to fail" applies to our banks

285
00:11:48,617 --> 00:11:49,618
but not our government.

286
00:11:49,685 --> 00:11:51,052
How'd you know?

287
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,787
Because that's what
every idiot with a bunker

288
00:11:52,855 --> 00:11:54,689
full of assault rifles
is scared of.

289
00:11:54,757 --> 00:11:57,192
Heather Sweeney.

290
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,828
Uh, it'll just be
a couple of minutes

291
00:11:59,896 --> 00:12:01,196
till someone's ready
to see you.

292
00:12:01,264 --> 00:12:03,832
Maybe it's not stupidity.
It's a symptom.

293
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:06,935
Cocaine abuse can cause paranoia
and chest pain.

294
00:12:07,003 --> 00:12:07,836
This isn't necessarily
paranoia.

295
00:12:07,903 --> 00:12:09,303
Societies do fall apart.

296
00:12:09,371 --> 00:12:11,205
Look what happened
with London and the riots.

297
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:13,441
There's a difference
between an isolated riot

298
00:12:13,508 --> 00:12:15,009
<i>and the fall</i>
<i>of civilization.</i>

299
00:12:15,076 --> 00:12:18,412
April Donaldson.

300
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:19,780
Sorry.
Misspoke.

301
00:12:19,847 --> 00:12:20,981
Imagine what would happen
if there was

302
00:12:21,049 --> 00:12:22,983
a terrorist attack
on the food supply

303
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,785
or a pandemic where we had
to ration antibiotics.

304
00:12:25,852 --> 00:12:28,087
- That's ridiculous.
- Ouch.

305
00:12:28,155 --> 00:12:29,755
Oh, shut up.

306
00:12:29,822 --> 00:12:31,389
We know what you're trying
to do, and it's not gonna work.

307
00:12:31,457 --> 00:12:34,692
It was a little harsh.

308
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,928
Stop being so...
What? Paranoid?

309
00:12:37,996 --> 00:12:40,431
You're gonna look pretty foolish
if that was the wrong guess.

310
00:12:40,498 --> 00:12:42,132
I think you're a good person
and a fine doctor,

311
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,334
but it's ridiculous
to think anyone needs

312
00:12:44,402 --> 00:12:45,902
an arsenal of assault weapons.

313
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,471
He's obviously paranoid.
What about Fahr's disease?

314
00:12:47,538 --> 00:12:49,273
He's not hallucinating.
As far as we know.

315
00:12:49,341 --> 00:12:50,675
We should do
a mental status examination

316
00:12:50,743 --> 00:12:52,644
and get a CT
of his basel ganglia.

317
00:12:52,712 --> 00:12:54,246
<i>No, we shouldn't.</i>

318
00:12:54,314 --> 00:12:56,181
If it's not poison, it's most
likely atrial fibrillation

319
00:12:56,249 --> 00:12:59,018
brought on by hyperthyroidism
or sleep apnea.

320
00:13:01,021 --> 00:13:03,656
Looks like we got ourselves
a good, ol'-fashioned cat fight.

321
00:13:03,724 --> 00:13:04,958
No, we don't.

322
00:13:05,025 --> 00:13:06,259
We have
a reasoned disagreement.

323
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,994
Still there's only one way
to settle this.

324
00:13:08,062 --> 00:13:09,496
Actually there's two,

325
00:13:09,564 --> 00:13:11,432
but we don't have enough jell-o
for the first.

326
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,733
Mini-mental,

327
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,168
CT,
and get a hair sample

328
00:13:15,236 --> 00:13:16,336
<i>to check</i>
<i>for past cocaine use.</i>

329
00:13:16,404 --> 00:13:19,406
Check his TSH levels
and get a sleep study.

330
00:13:19,474 --> 00:13:20,841
Sorry, we got to make it
a fair fight,

331
00:13:20,908 --> 00:13:21,875
which means
you're stuck with her.

332
00:13:21,943 --> 00:13:23,710
He's not "stuck" with me.

333
00:13:23,778 --> 00:13:25,178
And it's not a fight.

334
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:29,750
Uh, excuse me, miss,

335
00:13:29,818 --> 00:13:31,218
what is your name?

336
00:13:31,286 --> 00:13:32,787
Mariel Wilkerson.

337
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:35,991
Huh.

338
00:13:36,058 --> 00:13:37,493
You don't look
like a Mariel.

339
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,061
You're up.

340
00:13:51,942 --> 00:13:55,678
So what do you think--
is the patient paranoid or am I?

341
00:13:55,746 --> 00:13:57,446
I don't think
stockpiling weapons

342
00:13:57,514 --> 00:13:58,947
is the most reasoned response,

343
00:13:59,015 --> 00:14:00,249
but, given what I've seen
at Bloomingdale's

344
00:14:00,316 --> 00:14:01,817
on Black Friday,

345
00:14:01,885 --> 00:14:04,319
I wouldn't say it rises
to the level of mental illness.

346
00:14:04,387 --> 00:14:08,290
And me?

347
00:14:08,358 --> 00:14:11,961
Again, given what I've seen
at Bloomingdale's...

348
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:14,197
Don't let House get
to you.

349
00:14:14,265 --> 00:14:15,365
It's all of you.

350
00:14:15,433 --> 00:14:16,767
I feel like you don't
respect me.

351
00:14:16,834 --> 00:14:18,569
Chase certainly
doesn't try to hide it.

352
00:14:18,636 --> 00:14:20,270
Chase respects you.
He's just more comfortable

353
00:14:20,338 --> 00:14:22,206
working with me
because he's known me longer.

354
00:14:22,274 --> 00:14:23,741
And I'm not just saying that
because you own a gun.

355
00:14:23,808 --> 00:14:26,343
I don't own a gun.

356
00:14:26,411 --> 00:14:28,712
I've thought about it,
but I'd probably end up shooting

357
00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:30,780
someone in my own family,
like when my brother

358
00:14:30,848 --> 00:14:33,016
tosses his toenail clippings
behind the couch.

359
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,451
What about you?

360
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,821
If anarchy breaks out,

361
00:14:37,888 --> 00:14:39,822
I plan to do
what my ancestors have done

362
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:42,892
throughout the ages--run.

363
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,660
<i>Sounds like a good plan.</i>

364
00:14:44,728 --> 00:14:47,130
You got a moment?

365
00:14:49,467 --> 00:14:51,668
Stop telling the nurses
I'm looking for a girlfriend.

366
00:14:51,735 --> 00:14:53,169
What makes you--

367
00:14:53,237 --> 00:14:54,870
Two lunch offers
and a box of cupcakes

368
00:14:54,938 --> 00:14:56,305
since this morning.

369
00:14:56,373 --> 00:14:57,640
So a few people
are nice to you,

370
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:00,076
and your first thought is,
"Hmm, this seems strange"?

371
00:15:00,143 --> 00:15:02,345
I haven't even had enough time
to eat my own lunch,

372
00:15:02,412 --> 00:15:05,381
much less run around trying
to recruit nurses for yours.

373
00:15:05,448 --> 00:15:06,882
So can I get back to work?

374
00:15:10,753 --> 00:15:11,786
You're lying,
aren't you?

375
00:15:11,854 --> 00:15:14,188
It's for his own good.

376
00:15:14,256 --> 00:15:16,690
He's not paranoid.
He's just stupid.

377
00:15:16,758 --> 00:15:19,225
Well, shouldn't you put yourself
in that group?

378
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,994
You own a gun.

379
00:15:21,062 --> 00:15:25,799
Our patient doesn't own a gun.
He owns an arsenal.

380
00:15:25,867 --> 00:15:27,534
And I don't own a gun.

381
00:15:27,602 --> 00:15:29,904
Yes, you do.

382
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,972
And you're a felon,
so you'll end up back in jail--

383
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,475
That is actually not one
of the many reasons

384
00:15:34,543 --> 00:15:35,977
that I don't own a gun.

385
00:15:36,845 --> 00:15:38,613
Why would I need a gun?

386
00:15:38,681 --> 00:15:40,249
The only thing I own
worth protecting

387
00:15:40,316 --> 00:15:42,251
a thief would need a crane
to get out of my apartment.

388
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:43,786
You don't own anything
you need.

389
00:15:43,854 --> 00:15:45,320
You own things you want.

390
00:15:45,388 --> 00:15:46,788
And you're definitely the type
who'd want a gun.

391
00:15:46,856 --> 00:15:48,657
You like anything dangerous--

392
00:15:48,725 --> 00:15:51,226
monster trucks,
motorcycles, fireworks.

393
00:15:51,294 --> 00:15:52,961
Everyone loves fireworks.

394
00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:55,430
Watching them,
not making them.

395
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:57,565
I'm telling the truth.

396
00:15:57,633 --> 00:15:59,533
I stand corrected.

397
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:04,938
If you believe me,
then this issue will be resolved

398
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:06,539
with no further action
necessary.

399
00:16:06,607 --> 00:16:08,408
Absolutely.

400
00:16:08,476 --> 00:16:10,010
It's not resolved,
is it?

401
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:13,280
Not even close.

402
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:16,183
It's not cocaine.

403
00:16:16,251 --> 00:16:17,751
Hair samples were clean.

404
00:16:17,819 --> 00:16:19,119
It's not looking good
for Fahr's either.

405
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:21,088
I'm not seeing
any calcifications.

406
00:16:21,156 --> 00:16:22,122
You sure?

407
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,324
They can be pretty hard
to detect

408
00:16:23,392 --> 00:16:24,659
in people under 50.

409
00:16:24,727 --> 00:16:27,061
- See?
- What?

410
00:16:27,129 --> 00:16:29,063
We all disagree
all the time.

411
00:16:29,131 --> 00:16:30,532
It's not just me
and Park.

412
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,734
Nice try,

413
00:16:32,802 --> 00:16:34,470
but I'm not getting
in the middle.

414
00:16:34,538 --> 00:16:37,206
So why didn't you want
to go with her this morning?

415
00:16:37,274 --> 00:16:38,808
She's weird.

416
00:16:38,876 --> 00:16:40,477
She's not weird.
She's a good doctor.

417
00:16:40,544 --> 00:16:43,146
Most good doctors are weird.
Look at House.

418
00:16:43,214 --> 00:16:45,181
Am I weird?

419
00:16:45,249 --> 00:16:47,617
Yeah, but you're hot,
so it's easier to put up with.

420
00:16:51,388 --> 00:16:53,622
You're completely normal
and a pleasure to deal with.

421
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,557
You're weird.

422
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,325
In a good way?

423
00:16:57,393 --> 00:17:00,128
Maybe we should just concentrate
on the medicine.

424
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,730
You own any guns?

425
00:17:02,798 --> 00:17:04,065
That's not medicine.

426
00:17:04,133 --> 00:17:06,201
But it's related to medicine.
Kind of.

427
00:17:06,269 --> 00:17:07,802
What do you think?

428
00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:11,873
Yeah,
but not for protection.

429
00:17:11,941 --> 00:17:14,042
Despite what the media
would have us believe,

430
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:15,644
you think we live
in a very safe world.

431
00:17:15,712 --> 00:17:18,214
You just think
they're fun.

432
00:17:18,281 --> 00:17:20,583
How did you know?

433
00:17:20,651 --> 00:17:21,951
Working in prison,
you learned criminals

434
00:17:22,019 --> 00:17:23,420
rarely target
random strangers,

435
00:17:23,487 --> 00:17:25,422
and you've got more money
than you know what to do with,

436
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:28,425
so anything that seems different
and fun's worth trying.

437
00:17:28,493 --> 00:17:29,759
And you?

438
00:17:29,827 --> 00:17:31,595
Not here in the states.

439
00:17:31,662 --> 00:17:33,597
Back home, I keep a few
for hunting 'roos.

440
00:17:33,665 --> 00:17:35,165
You hunt kangaroos?

441
00:17:36,601 --> 00:17:38,168
But they're so cute.

442
00:17:38,236 --> 00:17:40,104
They're also delicious.

443
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,574
You're screwing
with me.

444
00:17:43,642 --> 00:17:45,309
Totally.

445
00:17:45,377 --> 00:17:46,743
There's no calcification.

446
00:17:46,811 --> 00:17:49,546
Looks like we're both wrong.

447
00:17:49,614 --> 00:17:51,548
You don't need to stay.

448
00:17:51,616 --> 00:17:53,516
We won't have the results
until the morning.

449
00:17:53,584 --> 00:17:55,385
It's okay.
I'll stay.

450
00:17:55,452 --> 00:17:59,322
Go.

451
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:02,058
I'm sure your mother's ready
for a break by now, huh?

452
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,860
<i>Give the kids</i>
<i>a kiss for me.</i>

453
00:18:04,928 --> 00:18:08,964
You think it's the end of
the world, but you wanted kids.

454
00:18:09,032 --> 00:18:11,133
Oh, honey,
come on.

455
00:18:11,201 --> 00:18:14,836
I don't think
the world's coming to an end.

456
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,174
Look...

457
00:18:20,242 --> 00:18:24,412
You have a spare tire
in your car, right?

458
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,616
That's what those guns are.

459
00:18:27,684 --> 00:18:30,353
I mean, I hope to God
I never have to use one.

460
00:18:30,421 --> 00:18:32,155
But if we can wake up

461
00:18:32,222 --> 00:18:33,957
<i>and learn</i>
<i>that the entire bank system</i>

462
00:18:34,024 --> 00:18:35,993
<i>has gone bankrupt overnight,</i>

463
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:39,664
it just seems stupid
not to have a jack in the trunk.

464
00:18:39,732 --> 00:18:42,100
<i>Just in case.</i>

465
00:18:42,167 --> 00:18:44,168
And you've always--

466
00:18:44,235 --> 00:18:45,269
What's that from?

467
00:18:45,337 --> 00:18:47,871
I don't know.

468
00:18:47,939 --> 00:18:49,139
<i>You don't feel that?</i>

469
00:18:49,207 --> 00:18:50,173
No.

470
00:18:54,422 --> 00:18:55,589
He also spiked
a fever overnight.

471
00:18:56,551 --> 00:18:58,219
It could be TB.

472
00:18:58,286 --> 00:18:59,620
You want to say it.

473
00:18:59,688 --> 00:19:01,656
- Say what?
- There's no sign of atelectasis

474
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:03,557
or infiltrates
on the chest X-ray.

475
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,560
Yeah. It's med-speak
for she's an idiot.

476
00:19:05,628 --> 00:19:08,396
Systemic sclerosis can cause
lower extremity ulcers.

477
00:19:08,463 --> 00:19:09,831
It would have to be
pretty far along

478
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,399
because the first symptom
was just a few days ago.

479
00:19:11,466 --> 00:19:13,334
His paranoia started
at least a year ago.

480
00:19:13,401 --> 00:19:14,668
If he's paranoid.

481
00:19:17,205 --> 00:19:18,539
<i>So it's either not sclerosis</i>

482
00:19:18,607 --> 00:19:20,574
or it's extremely aggressive
sclerosis.

483
00:19:20,642 --> 00:19:23,410
We should biopsy the skin lesion
and start him on enoxaparin.

484
00:19:23,478 --> 00:19:24,545
Shouldn't we wait
for the biopsy results

485
00:19:24,612 --> 00:19:26,646
before we start treatment?

486
00:19:26,714 --> 00:19:27,813
Now's your chance.

487
00:19:27,881 --> 00:19:29,615
<i>She's leading with her chin.</i>

488
00:19:29,683 --> 00:19:31,283
I agree with her.

489
00:19:31,351 --> 00:19:33,452
No, you don't.

490
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,188
Which means
you're both idiots.

491
00:19:36,256 --> 00:19:38,023
<i>Get to work.</i>

492
00:19:43,395 --> 00:19:44,896
I know you don't think
I'm an idiot.

493
00:19:46,331 --> 00:19:47,932
Does it matter?

494
00:19:47,999 --> 00:19:49,033
If you're just looking
to amuse yourself

495
00:19:49,101 --> 00:19:50,835
at my expense,
then no.

496
00:19:50,903 --> 00:19:53,438
But if you feel the need
to manipulate me

497
00:19:53,505 --> 00:19:55,707
to make me feel useful,
then yes.

498
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,109
I thought
we'd gotten past that.

499
00:19:57,176 --> 00:19:59,144
If we hadn't gotten past that,
you wouldn't be here.

500
00:19:59,212 --> 00:20:01,780
But ability
isn't always enough.

501
00:20:01,848 --> 00:20:04,116
Just ask Yngwie Malmsteen.

502
00:20:04,184 --> 00:20:05,418
So this is you
trying to help me?

503
00:20:05,485 --> 00:20:07,086
No, this is me helping me.

504
00:20:07,154 --> 00:20:09,022
And amusing myself
at your expense.

505
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:11,058
Which brings us back
to, why do you care?

506
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,593
I deserve respect.

507
00:20:12,661 --> 00:20:13,828
I'm a good doctor.

508
00:20:13,896 --> 00:20:17,699
People respect you.
They just don't like you.

509
00:20:21,037 --> 00:20:23,038
<i>Where's your wife?</i>

510
00:20:23,105 --> 00:20:27,775
She just needed some time.

511
00:20:27,843 --> 00:20:30,544
Not a fan of guns
I take it.

512
00:20:30,612 --> 00:20:34,514
It's not the guns.
It's...

513
00:20:34,582 --> 00:20:36,849
I shouldn't have lied
about it.

514
00:20:36,917 --> 00:20:39,419
I'm guessing
it's a little of both.

515
00:20:39,486 --> 00:20:42,522
And a little of,
"Who the hell is this guy?"

516
00:20:44,092 --> 00:20:47,228
I'm not a nutcase.

517
00:20:47,296 --> 00:20:48,963
<i>I just want to do</i>
<i>everything I can</i>

518
00:20:49,031 --> 00:20:50,899
to protect my family.

519
00:20:50,967 --> 00:20:54,270
Don't worry.
I'm sure she understands.

520
00:20:59,143 --> 00:21:01,078
At first, I thought
it might be frostbite,

521
00:21:01,145 --> 00:21:05,815
but I haven't really been out
in the cold.

522
00:21:05,883 --> 00:21:08,017
And yet your first thought
was frostbite?

523
00:21:08,085 --> 00:21:11,153
Yeah, I guess I was just going
by how it looks.

524
00:21:11,221 --> 00:21:13,789
It looks absolutely nothing
like frostbite.

525
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:15,057
You serious?

526
00:21:15,124 --> 00:21:17,292
With some difficulty.

527
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,493
Then what is it?

528
00:21:18,561 --> 00:21:21,730
A sign that you need
to take a long vacation.

529
00:21:21,797 --> 00:21:23,365
At least a month.

530
00:21:23,432 --> 00:21:24,633
A vacation?

531
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:29,172
Wait, is this
like a bucket list thing?

532
00:21:29,239 --> 00:21:30,139
It's cancer.

533
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:31,207
It's silver.

534
00:21:31,275 --> 00:21:32,509
I'm guessing

535
00:21:32,577 --> 00:21:34,411
silver nitrate
mixed with petroleum jelly

536
00:21:34,479 --> 00:21:36,280
that your boss
put on the petty cash

537
00:21:36,347 --> 00:21:38,516
so he'd know who to have
arrested for stealing it.

538
00:21:41,587 --> 00:21:42,687
Damn.

539
00:21:42,755 --> 00:21:44,922
Yeah, damn.

540
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:48,192
It's diffused into your skin,

541
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,627
and the only way
to get rid of it

542
00:21:49,695 --> 00:21:51,095
is to get new skin.

543
00:21:51,163 --> 00:21:54,231
That normally happens
every 30 days.

544
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:57,868
So I hear that La Crosse,
Wisconsin has got

545
00:21:57,936 --> 00:22:00,037
the world's largest beer can.

546
00:22:03,241 --> 00:22:05,509
Here's the per diem schedules.

547
00:22:05,577 --> 00:22:07,144
These are supposed
to be in the computer files.

548
00:22:07,212 --> 00:22:08,346
Sorry. Since Claudine left,

549
00:22:08,413 --> 00:22:09,847
no one's been inputting
the numbers.

550
00:22:09,915 --> 00:22:11,516
I miss Claudine.

551
00:22:11,584 --> 00:22:13,251
She left
because of you.

552
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:14,720
I thought
that was Nadine.

553
00:22:14,787 --> 00:22:16,221
- Her too.
- Where are you going?

554
00:22:16,289 --> 00:22:17,790
You still have an hour left.

555
00:22:17,858 --> 00:22:21,627
Emergency page
takes precedence.

556
00:22:21,695 --> 00:22:23,796
- Can you--
- I don't know how to use the program.

557
00:22:23,864 --> 00:22:24,930
Then find someone
who does.

558
00:22:24,998 --> 00:22:26,065
I got to get
out of here.

559
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,777
Got your page.

560
00:22:38,845 --> 00:22:40,812
You're an ass.

561
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,914
Admit it.

562
00:22:42,982 --> 00:22:45,450
Let me down.

563
00:22:45,518 --> 00:22:48,386
After you admit it.

564
00:22:51,957 --> 00:22:53,324
You know,
I'm a little tired.

565
00:22:53,392 --> 00:22:54,993
I think I'm gonna--
all right, I admit it.

566
00:22:55,061 --> 00:22:57,062
Despite the fact
that I know

567
00:22:57,129 --> 00:22:58,863
there's a gun in here,
I'd never find it

568
00:22:58,931 --> 00:23:01,900
because you are more devious--

569
00:23:01,967 --> 00:23:04,169
- Clever.
- Devious.

570
00:23:05,638 --> 00:23:07,072
All right, fine,
clever.

571
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:10,910
More clever and you'll always be
one step ahead of me.

572
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:31,800
You're either preparing
to fight Pacquiao

573
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:35,203
or you're having
one heck of a bad day.

574
00:23:35,271 --> 00:23:37,973
- I'm Anita.
- Eric.

575
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,042
Nice to meet you.

576
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:42,211
And you can tell Taub

577
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:44,213
that he's gonna get
the same treatment

578
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,381
as this heavy bag
if he doesn't cut this crap out.

579
00:23:46,449 --> 00:23:49,351
Who's Taub?

580
00:23:49,419 --> 00:23:51,553
You know, I'm sure
you're a nice person

581
00:23:51,621 --> 00:23:53,389
and you have no idea
what you've gotten sucked into,

582
00:23:53,456 --> 00:23:55,857
but, really,
I'm not interested.

583
00:23:55,925 --> 00:23:58,893
Okay, and I'm sure
you're a nice person,

584
00:23:58,961 --> 00:24:00,929
but I just moved
from Atlanta,

585
00:24:00,996 --> 00:24:02,297
and it's my first time
at this gym,

586
00:24:02,364 --> 00:24:05,066
so definitely don't know
who this Taub guy is,

587
00:24:05,134 --> 00:24:07,068
but I already agree.
He's a jerk.

588
00:24:09,271 --> 00:24:10,805
Are you sure
you don't want to start over?

589
00:24:13,709 --> 00:24:15,343
Take your time.

590
00:24:15,411 --> 00:24:18,080
I'll be around.

591
00:24:26,623 --> 00:24:28,057
Taub, it's Foreman.

592
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:29,392
Hey, can't talk now.
Little busy.

593
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,328
What's going on?

594
00:24:34,166 --> 00:24:35,266
Need some droperidol
in here!

595
00:24:35,334 --> 00:24:36,501
I gotta go!

596
00:24:39,157 --> 00:24:42,259
He was hallucinating
he was being attacked by bears.

597
00:24:42,327 --> 00:24:43,461
Points again
to paranoia.

598
00:24:43,529 --> 00:24:44,429
I agree.

599
00:24:44,496 --> 00:24:45,830
Except for the "again".

600
00:24:45,898 --> 00:24:48,133
Acute onset points
to tularemia.

601
00:24:48,201 --> 00:24:50,335
Or it's been chronic, which
points to GAD autoimmunity.

602
00:24:50,403 --> 00:24:52,571
<i>Explains</i>
<i>the neurological impairment</i>

603
00:24:52,639 --> 00:24:53,572
as well
as the normal blood work.

604
00:24:53,639 --> 00:24:54,473
Tularemia doesn't always show up

605
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,807
in blood work either.

606
00:24:55,875 --> 00:24:57,108
<i>You know what else</i>

607
00:24:57,176 --> 00:24:57,809
<i>doesn't show up</i>
<i>in the blood work?</i>

608
00:24:57,877 --> 00:24:59,144
Nothing.

609
00:24:59,211 --> 00:25:00,512
This could be
all psychiatric.

610
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,613
<i>An untreated schizoid disorder</i>

611
00:25:02,681 --> 00:25:04,081
<i>he's finally lost</i>
<i>the ability to suppress.</i>

612
00:25:04,149 --> 00:25:07,384
Schizophrenia doesn't cause
skin ulcers or fevers.

613
00:25:07,452 --> 00:25:08,918
No, but digging delusions
out of your skin

614
00:25:08,986 --> 00:25:10,153
with dirty fingernails
could cause both.

615
00:25:10,221 --> 00:25:12,155
I don't think
he's a psych case.

616
00:25:12,222 --> 00:25:13,723
Because you're paranoid
about paranoia.

617
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,124
<i>Because his symptoms</i>

618
00:25:15,192 --> 00:25:16,325
point towards an infection

619
00:25:16,393 --> 00:25:17,893
that spread to his brain.

620
00:25:17,961 --> 00:25:19,995
I think we should treat
with high-dose, broad-spectrum--

621
00:25:20,063 --> 00:25:23,265
which will kill him
if it's a GAD autoimmunity.

622
00:25:28,438 --> 00:25:30,606
Treat for GAD.

623
00:25:30,673 --> 00:25:33,808
Corticosteroids
and IV immunoglobulin.

624
00:25:40,015 --> 00:25:41,248
I'm not paranoid.

625
00:25:41,316 --> 00:25:42,283
And they don't dislike me.

626
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:44,018
They don't even really know me.

627
00:25:44,085 --> 00:25:45,486
They tell you that?

628
00:25:45,553 --> 00:25:48,555
I didn't ask because
you wouldn't believe the answer.

629
00:25:48,623 --> 00:25:50,991
If it makes you feel better
to think that.

630
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:53,260
You're the one
everyone dislikes.

631
00:25:53,328 --> 00:25:55,162
You probably don't even think
it's GAD.

632
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,497
You're just agreeing with her
because you think

633
00:25:56,565 --> 00:25:58,500
it'll create more conflict
between us.

634
00:25:58,568 --> 00:26:00,468
There's only one way
to find out.

635
00:26:00,536 --> 00:26:02,003
Actually, there's two.

636
00:26:02,071 --> 00:26:04,205
We're still waiting
for that jell-o delivery.

637
00:26:04,273 --> 00:26:07,042
Let me know
how it goes.

638
00:27:00,064 --> 00:27:02,065
Gotcha!

639
00:27:03,901 --> 00:27:06,704
You poor dumb bastard.

640
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,757
Touche.

641
00:28:08,435 --> 00:28:09,835
Mm.

642
00:28:14,341 --> 00:28:16,943
God, this is exactly
what I needed.

643
00:28:17,011 --> 00:28:19,780
Tell me
about it.

644
00:28:22,317 --> 00:28:23,984
<i>Anita.</i>

645
00:28:24,052 --> 00:28:25,486
Oh, my God.
Who is that, your roommate?

646
00:28:25,554 --> 00:28:26,888
It's just you have to go.

647
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,056
Wait a minute,
what's the big deal?

648
00:28:28,124 --> 00:28:29,558
Please.
I'll explain later.

649
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:30,692
Just hurry up.
Please.

650
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,494
You have a boyfriend?

651
00:28:32,562 --> 00:28:33,795
No,
he's not my boyfriend.

652
00:28:35,031 --> 00:28:36,865
He's my husband.

653
00:28:36,933 --> 00:28:38,633
I'm really sorry.

654
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:45,405
<i>Hey! I thought you weren't</i>
<i>getting back till tomorrow.</i>

655
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:52,863
His fever's going
through the roof,

656
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:54,298
which means we were wrong
about GAD

657
00:28:54,366 --> 00:28:56,266
and the steroids kicked
the infection into high gear.

658
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:58,836
Or it's GAD, and we started
treatment too late.

659
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,704
- Increase the steroid dose.
- We can't.

660
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:02,473
If it's an infection,
we'll kill him for sure.

661
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:05,510
With neurological symptoms
progressing this fast,

662
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:06,511
he's dead either way.

663
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:08,146
If we increase the steroids,

664
00:29:08,214 --> 00:29:10,115
then either death comes slower,

665
00:29:10,183 --> 00:29:12,018
which means we were too late
with the GAD,

666
00:29:12,085 --> 00:29:13,386
or death comes faster,

667
00:29:13,454 --> 00:29:15,755
which means we were too stupid
with the infection.

668
00:29:15,823 --> 00:29:17,591
We were already stupid
with the infection,

669
00:29:17,659 --> 00:29:18,992
but it's not too late.

670
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,562
He's young, and he was
perfectly healthy two days ago.

671
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:24,866
He can fight this off
if we give him a chance.

672
00:29:28,004 --> 00:29:29,504
Fine.

673
00:29:29,572 --> 00:29:31,105
But a shotgun
is not gonna work.

674
00:29:31,173 --> 00:29:32,473
We need a sniper rifle.

675
00:29:32,541 --> 00:29:35,343
Start running DNA assays
for sporotrichosis,

676
00:29:35,411 --> 00:29:36,744
meningococcemia,

677
00:29:36,812 --> 00:29:39,347
and any other boggle-winning
words you can think of.

678
00:29:39,415 --> 00:29:41,216
You just said you wanted
to increase the steroids,

679
00:29:41,283 --> 00:29:43,551
and now you want to just--
- I changed my mind.

680
00:29:43,619 --> 00:29:45,653
- But--
Do what Park says.

681
00:29:54,196 --> 00:29:56,830
Well, you don't have a gun,

682
00:29:56,898 --> 00:29:59,999
but you do have
my sunglasses,

683
00:30:00,067 --> 00:30:02,501
my tennis racket--
I can't imagine why--

684
00:30:02,569 --> 00:30:04,070
Had to kill a mouse.

685
00:30:04,137 --> 00:30:06,639
It was really hard with
those stupid little sunglasses.

686
00:30:06,707 --> 00:30:09,041
And my money clip.

687
00:30:09,109 --> 00:30:10,376
<i>Was there any money in it?</i>

688
00:30:10,444 --> 00:30:11,577
Not anymore.

689
00:30:11,645 --> 00:30:13,813
Can I go to bed now?

690
00:30:13,881 --> 00:30:15,648
Or do you want
to do a cavity search?

691
00:30:15,716 --> 00:30:18,351
Lock up
on your way out.

692
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:19,953
This is ridiculous.

693
00:30:20,021 --> 00:30:22,289
Every moment we waste
looking for a phantom infection

694
00:30:22,357 --> 00:30:23,590
is time
we could be treating him.

695
00:30:23,658 --> 00:30:24,758
<i>For the wrong diagnosis.</i>

696
00:30:24,826 --> 00:30:26,694
If it was GAD,
he'd be having seizures.

697
00:30:26,762 --> 00:30:27,829
<i>If it was infection,</i>

698
00:30:27,896 --> 00:30:28,629
there would be
some sign of it

699
00:30:28,697 --> 00:30:29,797
in his blood or CNS.

700
00:30:29,865 --> 00:30:31,333
- Which there isn't.
- Yet.

701
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,169
I'm beginning to think we should
just go with House's idea.

702
00:30:34,237 --> 00:30:36,306
This was House's idea.
He said--

703
00:30:36,373 --> 00:30:38,107
no, I'm talking
about the jell-o.

704
00:30:38,175 --> 00:30:39,709
<i>At least it wouldn't be</i>
<i>so annoying to watch.</i>

705
00:30:41,245 --> 00:30:43,046
Taub, you got a minute?

706
00:30:46,417 --> 00:30:47,951
You're an ass.
You know that?

707
00:30:48,019 --> 00:30:49,219
What's the problem?

708
00:30:49,287 --> 00:30:52,055
Some cute young nurse
baked you cookies?

709
00:30:52,123 --> 00:30:54,691
No, some guy almost caught me
making out with his wife

710
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:56,627
in their living room.

711
00:30:56,694 --> 00:30:59,296
And how exactly
is that my fault?

712
00:30:59,364 --> 00:31:00,397
If you hadn't been
screwing with me

713
00:31:00,465 --> 00:31:01,632
and put the idea
in my head...

714
00:31:01,699 --> 00:31:03,033
So you don't date anyone
unless I put the idea

715
00:31:03,101 --> 00:31:04,101
in your head.

716
00:31:04,168 --> 00:31:05,402
You really do need
psychiatric help.

717
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:06,803
Unlike you,

718
00:31:06,871 --> 00:31:08,238
I don't need drama.

719
00:31:08,306 --> 00:31:09,839
I like my job,

720
00:31:09,907 --> 00:31:10,907
and I'm happy
with my life.

721
00:31:10,975 --> 00:31:12,542
You're so happy
with your life

722
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:14,110
you've got nothing
better to do at midnight

723
00:31:14,177 --> 00:31:16,145
than to come back into work
to yell at me?

724
00:31:16,212 --> 00:31:20,048
Stay out of my business.

725
00:31:22,918 --> 00:31:26,354
You're blaming the wrong guy.

726
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:29,958
Good for him.

727
00:31:31,694 --> 00:31:34,897
Married one's not a keeper,
but it's a start.

728
00:31:36,066 --> 00:31:37,366
You're an idiot.

729
00:31:47,077 --> 00:31:48,878
He has stridor
but no obstruction.

730
00:31:48,946 --> 00:31:50,313
He's anaphylaxing.
Get me a trach kit.

731
00:31:55,452 --> 00:31:57,053
Scalpel.

732
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:20,477
It's not working.
There's no breath sounds.

733
00:32:20,545 --> 00:32:21,878
It doesn't make any sense.

734
00:32:21,946 --> 00:32:23,747
His trachea's blocked
below the incision point.

735
00:32:23,815 --> 00:32:25,482
We need racemic epinephrine.
<i>We tried that already.</i>

736
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:26,383
We're gonna try again.

737
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:27,684
It's our only choice.

738
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:36,153
We got him breathing,
but barely.

739
00:32:36,221 --> 00:32:38,021
At least we know
tracheal edema

740
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:39,122
isn't from anything
we did

741
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:41,091
because we're not doing
anything.

742
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:42,526
<i>Which is a good thing,</i>
<i>because neither GAD</i>

743
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:44,628
<i>nor systemic infection</i>
<i>would cause anaphylaxis</i>

744
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:45,663
or tracheal edema.

745
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,398
And an allergic reaction

746
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,166
wouldn't get worse three days
after he was admitted.

747
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:52,769
So we've got nothing.

748
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:55,472
Unless he was
still being poisoned.

749
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,373
<i>By who?</i>

750
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:57,574
His wife wasn't even here

751
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,977
when he hallucinated.

752
00:33:00,045 --> 00:33:01,445
Good question.

753
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:03,548
Now we're the ones
being paranoid.

754
00:33:05,751 --> 00:33:08,019
What about
squamous cell carcinoma?

755
00:33:08,087 --> 00:33:09,921
<i>If it's only in his epithelium,</i>

756
00:33:09,989 --> 00:33:11,789
it wouldn't show up
in his chest X-ray.

757
00:33:11,857 --> 00:33:14,492
It is possible, but...

758
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,960
Wouldn't cause hallucinations.

759
00:33:16,028 --> 00:33:17,628
It could if you also have
paraneoplastic syndrome.

760
00:33:22,968 --> 00:33:24,002
Get a biopsy.

761
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,804
You think it's cancer?

762
00:33:25,872 --> 00:33:28,908
I think
you should get a biopsy.

763
00:33:39,486 --> 00:33:40,953
Admit it.

764
00:33:46,325 --> 00:33:48,861
<i>Two hours ago,</i>
<i>I found this in your closet</i>

765
00:33:48,929 --> 00:33:50,663
in a box
with your name on it.

766
00:33:50,731 --> 00:33:53,867
I knew you'd move it
somewhere outside your apartment

767
00:33:53,934 --> 00:33:56,436
until you were certain
I'd given up looking.

768
00:33:56,504 --> 00:34:00,006
So I had to convince you
that I'd given up looking.

769
00:34:00,074 --> 00:34:02,608
That's not a gun.

770
00:34:05,545 --> 00:34:10,882
Yes, it's a paperweight
with a handy storage compartment

771
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:15,153
for .45-caliber bullets.

772
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:17,522
- And that's not a bullet.
- Admit it.

773
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:19,624
I'm more clever
and more devious.

774
00:34:19,691 --> 00:34:20,992
You can even have it back.

775
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,860
It's not my problem
if you go back to prison.

776
00:34:22,928 --> 00:34:24,429
My problem is you thinking

777
00:34:24,496 --> 00:34:26,064
you're always one step
ahead of me.

778
00:34:26,131 --> 00:34:28,166
This proves nothing
because it's not a gun.

779
00:34:28,234 --> 00:34:29,968
It's a prop.

780
00:34:30,035 --> 00:34:32,103
From Dorothy Dietrich's
magic act.

781
00:34:32,171 --> 00:34:34,139
<i>Look it up.</i>

782
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:36,407
She's the only woman to ever do
the "catch a bullet" trick.

783
00:34:36,475 --> 00:34:39,143
I won this
off her prop master

784
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:40,277
in a poker game.

785
00:34:40,345 --> 00:34:41,979
House--
it's fake.

786
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:45,415
It's plugged.

787
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:48,351
Look for yourself.

788
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,053
Hey, hey, don't point

789
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:51,221
that thing at me.

790
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:52,889
It's not dangerous
because it's not a gun.

791
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:54,557
House, House,
just stop it.

792
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:57,527
Fine.

793
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:03,100
What the hell
are you doing?

794
00:35:03,168 --> 00:35:04,669
Pull the trigger.
Don't be insane.

795
00:35:04,737 --> 00:35:06,104
They're blanks.

796
00:35:06,172 --> 00:35:07,806
You pull the trigger,

797
00:35:07,873 --> 00:35:09,775
I drool a little fake blood,

798
00:35:09,842 --> 00:35:11,777
and then I spit out the bullet
that the audience thinks

799
00:35:11,844 --> 00:35:13,145
I caught in my teeth.
Go ahead.

800
00:35:13,212 --> 00:35:14,813
Shoot me.

801
00:35:14,881 --> 00:35:15,914
I'm not shooting you.

802
00:35:15,982 --> 00:35:17,783
All right.
I'll shoot you.

803
00:35:17,851 --> 00:35:20,920
Don't.
House, don't.

804
00:35:20,987 --> 00:35:23,322
Even if they are blanks,
people'll freak.

805
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:27,259
It's not real.

806
00:35:27,327 --> 00:35:31,363
Which means you didn't prove
that I have a gun.

807
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,663
Which means
you proved nothing.

808
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:36,167
Admit it.

809
00:35:43,477 --> 00:35:47,380
<i>Admit it.</i>

810
00:35:47,448 --> 00:35:49,850
- All right.
- All right, what?

811
00:35:53,288 --> 00:35:54,756
You win.

812
00:35:54,824 --> 00:35:57,593
And it feels good.

813
00:35:59,563 --> 00:36:03,132
Grr.

814
00:36:29,694 --> 00:36:31,596
You were wrong.

815
00:36:31,663 --> 00:36:33,398
Don't feel too bad.

816
00:36:33,465 --> 00:36:34,732
We all were.

817
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,134
His trachea wasn't swollen.

818
00:36:36,202 --> 00:36:38,536
It was blocked
by a pseudomembrane

819
00:36:38,604 --> 00:36:40,204
growing across it.

820
00:36:40,272 --> 00:36:42,673
It means he's not paranoid,
is an idiot,

821
00:36:42,741 --> 00:36:46,110
and was poisoned.

822
00:36:46,177 --> 00:36:47,111
What are you doing?

823
00:36:47,178 --> 00:36:48,712
Give me a machida scope.

824
00:36:50,581 --> 00:36:53,483
Hold his legs.
He's not gonna like this.

825
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:58,554
Because you're not gonna be able
to breathe.

826
00:36:58,622 --> 00:37:03,192
But I need to see
down your barrel.

827
00:37:04,962 --> 00:37:09,233
The good news is the poison
didn't come from your wife.

828
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,735
It came from a little bastard
of a bacterium

829
00:37:10,802 --> 00:37:14,105
whose crap
can cause chest pain,

830
00:37:14,173 --> 00:37:16,808
respiratory distress,
skin ulcers,

831
00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:19,778
the growth of pseudomembrane
across the airway,

832
00:37:19,845 --> 00:37:24,882
and, in very rare cases,
hallucinations.

833
00:37:31,956 --> 00:37:33,890
Call the CDC.

00:37:33,958 --> 00:37:35,625
<i>Tell them we need antitoxin</i>

835

You just getting in?

847
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:18,337

Cool.

How are you feeling?

850
00:38:23,576 --> 00:38:28,012
Not great.

00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,480
But better.

852
00:38:31,316 --> 00:38:34,384
The antitoxin is working.

853
00:38:34,452 --> 00:38:36,720
He'll be able to go home
in a few days.

I know, okay.

859
00:38:48,401 --> 00:38:50,369
It was for our own good,
but I don't care.

860
00:38:50,437 --> 00:38:52,739
I don't want to be lied to,

861
00:38:52,807 --> 00:38:54,341
and I can't live like that.

862
00:38:54,409 --> 00:38:56,176
I can't live

863
00:38:58,747 --> 00:39:01,048
