1
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,044
Whoo!

2
00:00:06,188 --> 00:00:08,363
All right, hold on.
I got to turn up here.

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,671
Whoo! Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

4
00:00:18,514 --> 00:00:19,864
How cool was that?

5
00:00:19,918 --> 00:00:21,881
That was way cool.

6
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:23,220
Oh.

7
00:00:26,567 --> 00:00:27,417
My turn.

8
00:00:27,567 --> 00:00:28,723
No, sorry, that's not allowed.

9
00:00:28,873 --> 00:00:32,062
I just signed 15 pages of forms,
saying you gotta ride
on the back of that thing.

10
00:00:32,146 --> 00:00:33,753
I don't see any lawyers around.

11
00:00:33,971 --> 00:00:35,076
You know that's not the point.

12
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:38,277
No, you just wanna keep
all the fun to yourself.

13
00:00:40,052 --> 00:00:41,506
Come on, Dad.

14
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:45,192
You go over 15,
we're pulling over.
All right, I mean it.

15
00:00:45,276 --> 00:00:47,009
- You're the best.
- All right, get on there.

16
00:00:47,623 --> 00:00:48,789
Put on your goggles.

17
00:00:50,597 --> 00:00:51,386
Ready?

18
00:00:51,928 --> 00:00:53,908
Got the clutch in?
All right, that's my boy.

19
00:00:53,908 --> 00:00:57,069
Whoo! Hoo-hoo!

20
00:00:57,787 --> 00:00:59,788
Whoo!

21
00:01:01,669 --> 00:01:03,472
Whoo!

22
00:01:08,528 --> 00:01:10,665
Adam, you're going too fast.
Slow it down.

23
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,233
I mean it.
You're going too fast.
Slow down!

24
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:18,559
Adam!

25
00:01:24,172 --> 00:01:25,545
Adam!

26
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,737
Let go of the throttle!

27
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:36,982
Adam! Adam! Adam!

28
00:01:38,687 --> 00:01:43,353
2x12 - Distractions

29
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:08,812
Original Airdate (FOX):  14 February-2006

30
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:11,800
What do you got?

31
00:02:11,862 --> 00:02:15,807
16-year-old, status post, ATV crash,
40% of burns on his body.

32
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:18,906
Nasotracheal intubation.
Start a bag of lactated Ringer's,
wide open.

33
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:19,765
Is he gonna be okay?

34
00:02:19,866 --> 00:02:22,058
We'll be with you when we can.
Get him out!

35
00:02:22,966 --> 00:02:24,354
Wait, wait, wait.

36
00:02:24,786 --> 00:02:25,828
I'll start fluids.

37
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:27,705
Let's go get him moved up.

38
00:02:43,064 --> 00:02:45,045
De-re-maki.

39
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:47,551
De-re-maki.

40
00:02:50,002 --> 00:02:50,965
Been looking for you.

41
00:02:51,266 --> 00:02:52,872
Been avoiding you.

42
00:02:53,021 --> 00:02:54,173
Burn unit can handle it.

43
00:02:54,278 --> 00:02:57,160
If they could handle it,
they wouldn't be asking for you.

44
00:02:59,624 --> 00:03:00,507
Is that a journal?

45
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:01,761
A friend wrote an article.

46
00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:02,915
In Hindi?

47
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:06,127
They have a cutting edge
neuroscience program in India.

48
00:03:06,435 --> 00:03:08,581
Says so right on the cover.

49
00:03:12,235 --> 00:03:14,788
This kid's heart rate's messed.

50
00:03:14,841 --> 00:03:17,242
Tachycardia can be
explained by the burn.

51
00:03:17,303 --> 00:03:19,458
I assume the burn unit knew that.

52
00:03:21,965 --> 00:03:23,477
His potassium's low.

53
00:03:23,581 --> 00:03:25,555
Which can also be
explained by the burn.

54
00:03:25,756 --> 00:03:28,306
Except I'm sure the burn unit's
pumping him with fluids,

55
00:03:28,348 --> 00:03:30,812
which means his potassium
should be going up, not down.

56
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:32,395
Could be amphetamines.

57
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:34,467
Or bacteria lunching on his heart.

58
00:03:34,551 --> 00:03:37,906
Or cardiomyopathy, or
some other very bad thing.

59
00:03:38,016 --> 00:03:39,615
He needs an EKG.

60
00:03:41,736 --> 00:03:43,062
Eww.

61
00:03:46,573 --> 00:03:49,847
Okay, no skin, no EKG.

62
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:51,841
Is he even going to survive the burn?

63
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:54,242
You got a date or something?

64
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:57,135
40% of his body.

65
00:03:57,241 --> 00:03:59,567
If the burns unit can
prevent an infection,

66
00:03:59,757 --> 00:04:03,645
his body will regenerate maybe 10%.
Surgeon's will do 20 or so grafts.

67
00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:06,964
Six months in this room,
he'll end up with a series of nasty scars.

68
00:04:07,432 --> 00:04:09,918
Maybe some pain,  but he'll live.

69
00:04:10,486 --> 00:04:15,735
Unless his heart shuts down, because
we can't figure out what's causing
the low potassium and tachycardia.

70
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,582
We need help from a Belgian Doc,
named Einthoven.

71
00:04:20,814 --> 00:04:21,851
He's dead.

72
00:04:22,153 --> 00:04:25,944
While he was alive,
he invented a little ditty
called the Galvanometer.

73
00:04:26,288 --> 00:04:27,062
Where do we get one?

74
00:04:27,144 --> 00:04:30,799
Go to any electronics store
that's been open since before 1905.

75
00:04:30,908 --> 00:04:33,755
There's a good chance they got one
in the corner in the basement.

76
00:04:36,322 --> 00:04:38,625
We need an audio/visual  setup for the lecture hall.

77
00:04:38,815 --> 00:04:40,522
- What for?
- For the lecture.

78
00:04:40,667 --> 00:04:43,277
- What lecture?
- Dr. Weber's lecture.

79
00:04:43,497 --> 00:04:47,206
- Who's Dr. Weber?
- Uh, neurologist, I think.

80
00:04:47,534 --> 00:04:49,128
The memo was from you.

81
00:04:55,841 --> 00:04:58,001
- Where's my assistant?
- She left.

82
00:04:58,085 --> 00:04:59,198
- When?
- Wednesday.

83
00:04:59,281 --> 00:05:02,743
- Seriously?
- The temp agency sent someone,
but she got lost.

84
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:05,820
Well, when she gets here,
fire her.

85
00:05:26,021 --> 00:05:27,832
Oh, yeah.

86
00:05:27,898 --> 00:05:29,440
Did you issue this memo?

87
00:05:29,657 --> 00:05:30,853
Look at that.

88
00:05:32,484 --> 00:05:33,681
Congratulations.

89
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:37,525
The patient that has been
in a coma for two years and
counting is still in a coma.

90
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,279
This is not my signature.

91
00:05:39,427 --> 00:05:42,476
I don't know
anything about this guy.
I'm supposed to introduce him?

92
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,875
Have lunch?

93
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,506
[Monitor bleeping]

94
00:05:45,681 --> 00:05:47,596
The  coma patient
has a migraine?

95
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,636
Oh, no, no, no.

96
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,023
No, I gave him medication
to prevent a migraine.

97
00:05:51,107 --> 00:05:54,882
That's a migraine.
Increased flow velocity
in his cerebral arteries.

98
00:05:54,966 --> 00:05:57,592
I did, subsequently,
give him nitroglycerin,
which could possibly--

99
00:05:57,676 --> 00:06:01,942
You induced
a migraine headache
in a coma patient?

100
00:06:02,026 --> 00:06:03,552
I gave him
a little headache.

101
00:06:03,717 --> 00:06:05,605
Similar to the one
you're giving me now.

102
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:08,293
Have you even read
an ethical guideline?

103
00:06:08,414 --> 00:06:13,684
Well,  it'd be wrong to try out
a new migraine prevention medication
on someone who can actually feel pain.

104
00:06:13,735 --> 00:06:14,931
Did you sign this?

105
00:06:15,033 --> 00:06:16,956
Uh...yeah.

106
00:06:18,172 --> 00:06:21,227
We can talk later about
the appropriate discipline.

107
00:06:25,024 --> 00:06:28,585
Because of the burn, we can't
perform any of our normal tests
to see what's wrong.

108
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:30,910
So we're going to
try a Galvanometer.

109
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:35,003
It picks up a pulse
in the wrists and the ankles.

110
00:06:35,487 --> 00:06:38,368
Hopefully it will tell us
why his heart rhythm is abnormal.

111
00:06:38,777 --> 00:06:40,229
What have I done to him. I--

112
00:06:40,385 --> 00:06:41,888
It was an accident.

113
00:06:42,798 --> 00:06:44,256
All right, so...

114
00:06:45,344 --> 00:06:48,864
he's got all these burns.
And now there's something
wrong with his heart?

115
00:06:48,948 --> 00:06:51,598
We're trying to figure out
if the two are somehow connected.

116
00:06:51,783 --> 00:06:53,764
Had  he been sick lately?

117
00:06:53,848 --> 00:06:54,880
No, nothing.

118
00:06:54,964 --> 00:06:57,676
Anything unusual
with his behavior?
Had he been tired a lot?

119
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:59,749
- Nothing.
- He was great. He was happy.

120
00:06:59,933 --> 00:07:02,345
He was just having
a great time and then--

121
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:06,228
If he was experimenting
with amphetamines or cocaine--

122
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,174
No.

123
00:07:08,026 --> 00:07:10,760
We gave him some pot
about a year ago to try.

124
00:07:10,844 --> 00:07:11,885
It was just once.

125
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:16,335
We thought if we took the mystery
out of drugs and alcohol,
the less he'd experiment.

126
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:18,260
We'll know more after the tests.

127
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:23,294
It looks like they're gonna
electrocute him.

128
00:07:24,842 --> 00:07:25,799
Plug it in.

129
00:07:27,686 --> 00:07:29,236
You plug it in.

130
00:07:29,898 --> 00:07:31,767
Fine. Gimme the cord.

131
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:39,905
Works.

132
00:07:42,251 --> 00:07:43,819
Prominent U-waves.

133
00:07:43,903 --> 00:07:45,248
No inverted T-wave.

134
00:07:45,393 --> 00:07:46,827
No ischemia.

135
00:07:46,975 --> 00:07:48,540
Q-wave normal.

136
00:07:49,485 --> 00:07:50,939
That's not good.

137
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,056
Chase, turn it off.

138
00:07:56,182 --> 00:07:57,161
Turn it off!

139
00:07:57,245 --> 00:07:58,975
- What's happening?
- What is that?

140
00:07:59,469 --> 00:08:01,122
He's seizing, get in here.

141
00:08:06,801 --> 00:08:08,531
Who electrocuted my patient?

142
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,413
- He had a seizure.
- He wasn't electrocuted.

143
00:08:10,497 --> 00:08:11,920
What does the seizure tell us?

144
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:13,366
Move.

145
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:14,537
What are you looking for?

146
00:08:14,622 --> 00:08:18,386
Same as you.
Love, acceptance.
Solid return on investments.

147
00:08:18,471 --> 00:08:20,020
Differential diagnosis.
Go.

148
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:22,049
Could be epilepsy,
or seizure disorder.

149
00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:23,622
Not with the tachycardia.

150
00:08:23,772 --> 00:08:25,536
It could be a virus in his brain.

151
00:08:25,619 --> 00:08:27,438
Specificity's impressive.

152
00:08:27,962 --> 00:08:29,563
Adrenoleukodystrophy.

153
00:08:29,647 --> 00:08:33,541
Could be M.S.,
seizures could be caused
by plaques and lesions on the brain.

154
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:36,148
Well, let's find out which.
Get him an MRI.

155
00:08:36,232 --> 00:08:37,866
No nuclear imaging.

156
00:08:39,874 --> 00:08:41,462
He wouldn't survive
the move to Radiology.

157
00:08:41,546 --> 00:08:43,687
MRI and CT scan are both out.

158
00:08:44,116 --> 00:08:48,789
Okay. Lumbar puncture'll tell us
if his proteins are elevated.
At least we can exclude M.S.

159
00:08:48,883 --> 00:08:50,828
Can't do a lumbar puncture either.

160
00:08:52,689 --> 00:08:54,595
You're cramping my exits.

161
00:08:54,772 --> 00:08:56,646
Don't tell me,
no skin on his spine.

162
00:08:56,752 --> 00:08:59,522
We'd be inserting
a needle into an area
that's teeming with bacteria.

163
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:02,273
If he doesn't have
a brain infection already,
we'd give him one for sure.

164
00:09:02,464 --> 00:09:04,539
There's no other way
to look at a brain.

165
00:09:06,196 --> 00:09:08,482
Transcranial Doppler Sonography.

166
00:09:08,566 --> 00:09:12,661
She said brain,
not pregnant woman's uterus.
They do sound alike.

167
00:09:12,745 --> 00:09:14,330
I used one to look at
a brain this morning.

168
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:17,041
Why didn't you take the patient
to Radiology, get an MRA?

169
00:09:17,192 --> 00:09:19,396
Obviously, I was
doing something illegal,

170
00:09:19,462 --> 00:09:21,741
and using nuclear imaging
would've raised questions.

171
00:09:21,792 --> 00:09:24,617
You're not gonna get
a diagnosis of M.S. from a sonogram.

172
00:09:24,701 --> 00:09:29,681
Not definitively, but patients with M.S.
have more reactive neurons
in their occipital cortex.

173
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,105
Okay, then?

174
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:43,359
Thank you for all
coming to today's lecture
by Dr. Phillip Weber,

175
00:09:43,674 --> 00:09:50,350
who is our guest today
at our hospital to talk
about headaches.

176
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:54,592
Dr. Weber is
at the Weber Center for Pain.
That makes sense.

177
00:09:55,206 --> 00:09:58,165
Weber-Weber, um.
So please welcome, Dr. Weber.

178
00:10:05,446 --> 00:10:08,926
Thank you, Doctor...Cuddy.

179
00:10:10,731 --> 00:10:14,674
I suppose I should tell you
a little bit more about myself.

180
00:10:15,086 --> 00:10:17,769
I went to school in Virginia,

181
00:10:18,632 --> 00:10:21,684
You've never to one of
these things in your life.
Who is this guy?

182
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,484
No idea.

183
00:10:24,585 --> 00:10:26,078
What's with the outfit?

184
00:10:26,803 --> 00:10:29,865
Sudden chills,
and light sensitivity.

185
00:10:30,011 --> 00:10:31,548
Inexplicable.

186
00:10:32,354 --> 00:10:35,771
I received my medical degree
at Johns Hopkins University,

187
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,944
where I studied under
Brightman and Gilmar.

188
00:10:39,275 --> 00:10:42,293
Hmm...he must be good.
You went to Hopkins

189
00:10:42,377 --> 00:10:44,058
and studied under
Brightman and Gilmar.

190
00:10:44,154 --> 00:10:45,715
Shh...

191
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:49,135
...helped me win
the Doyle internship
at the Mayo clinic.

192
00:10:49,219 --> 00:10:52,063
You were supposed to
get the Doyle internship.

193
00:10:54,681 --> 00:10:56,684
This guy's Von Lieberman?

194
00:10:56,837 --> 00:10:58,375
The guy got you
thrown out for cheating?

195
00:10:58,443 --> 00:11:00,319
The Dean threw me out.

196
00:11:00,403 --> 00:11:02,290
Von Lieberman just ratted on me.

197
00:11:02,357 --> 00:11:04,370
This guy's name is Weber,
not Von Lieberman.

198
00:11:04,464 --> 00:11:06,372
I call Weber Von Lieberman.

199
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:08,848
Way eviler. Shh...

200
00:11:09,038 --> 00:11:14,547
...and five HT Sub 1D receptors
have improved the acute
treatment of migraines.

201
00:11:15,116 --> 00:11:16,528
To this point...

202
00:11:16,878 --> 00:11:18,365
So what's the plan?

203
00:11:18,507 --> 00:11:21,384
You wanna wait 'til he bends over
and make a fart sound?

204
00:11:22,222 --> 00:11:24,519
I'm not here about the past.

205
00:11:24,569 --> 00:11:26,726
He's a bad scientist.

206
00:11:27,263 --> 00:11:30,645
Well, you cheated off him,
how bad can he be?

207
00:11:31,746 --> 00:11:33,735
He got the answer wrong.

208
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:43,226
Doug:
Are they trying to wake him up?

209
00:11:43,226 --> 00:11:45,393
They can't do that, right?
He'll be in too much pain.

210
00:11:45,477 --> 00:11:47,532
Don't worry, he's still under.

211
00:11:47,929 --> 00:11:50,983
But the brain never completely
sleeps, it's always working.

212
00:11:51,163 --> 00:11:54,962
Controlling your heart rate.
Breathing. Temperature.

213
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,908
Cameron:
The eyes respond
to visual stimuli.

214
00:11:57,992 --> 00:12:02,043
Blood flow increases
in certain areas of the brain and
we can track that with a sonogram.

215
00:12:02,584 --> 00:12:07,172
With M.S., blood vessels are
more reactive, so flow is faster.

216
00:12:07,256 --> 00:12:09,462
If Adam has an infection,

217
00:12:09,608 --> 00:12:11,932
there'd be swelling which
would constrict the arteries,

218
00:12:12,017 --> 00:12:13,931
and the flow would be slower.

219
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:17,815
Chase, near the subarachnoid space.

220
00:12:18,874 --> 00:12:21,743
[Monitor bleeping]

221
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:30,929
Data from control subjects were analyzed
with a two-way ANOVA with status
and side as within-subject factors.

222
00:12:32,142 --> 00:12:36,137
You stalked this guy for 20 years
just for the shot to humiliate him?

223
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:37,896
Shh. I'm trying to learn.

224
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,215
...vessels without significant rebound.

225
00:12:40,317 --> 00:12:42,353
He doesn't even know
what that means.

226
00:12:43,034 --> 00:12:44,535
You're going to
interrupt him, aren't you?

227
00:12:44,696 --> 00:12:46,071
If I have a question.

228
00:12:46,326 --> 00:12:47,950
And what's that
going to accomplish?

229
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:50,349
Why can't you just enjoy this?

230
00:12:50,454 --> 00:12:52,100
Why can't you just
be happy for me?

231
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:56,465
You have got to find
less debilitating outlets
than humiliating people.

232
00:12:56,566 --> 00:13:00,319
I hear bowling is
more fun than stalking.

233
00:13:00,688 --> 00:13:01,922
But I'm better at this.

234
00:13:02,134 --> 00:13:04,688
If P is less than point zero...

235
00:13:04,772 --> 00:13:07,366
Blow a ton of money
on a plasma TV.

236
00:13:08,745 --> 00:13:10,870
We found a subarachnoid bleed.

237
00:13:12,294 --> 00:13:14,642
Bleed in the head
isn't causing seizures.

238
00:13:14,796 --> 00:13:18,028
It could be. 10% with damage
to the cerebral cortex have seizures.

239
00:13:18,112 --> 00:13:19,673
Or bacterial meningitis.

240
00:13:19,773 --> 00:13:20,833
Viral encephalitis?

241
00:13:20,917 --> 00:13:21,948
There's no way
to tell without--

242
00:13:22,032 --> 00:13:23,403
Shut up!

243
00:13:24,544 --> 00:13:25,915
Excuse me?

244
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,205
Not you.

245
00:13:28,352 --> 00:13:31,884
If my lecture is interrupting
your meeting, I can wait.

246
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:33,874
[Says something in Hindi]

247
00:13:35,168 --> 00:13:38,146
As your people say in India.
Appreciate it.

248
00:13:38,232 --> 00:13:41,888
We'll figure out why later.
Um, fix the bleed, or he dies.

249
00:13:41,993 --> 00:13:43,492
Talk to you
in a couple of hours.

250
00:13:46,677 --> 00:13:48,485
De-re-maki.

251
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:00,169
I'm in the subarachnoid space.

252
00:14:01,712 --> 00:14:02,609
Can you get it?

253
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,940
I think so.

254
00:14:06,223 --> 00:14:08,250
Put the probe back where
it was so I can see the wire.

255
00:14:08,334 --> 00:14:10,058
- We're looking for the bleed--
- Look when I get there!

256
00:14:10,142 --> 00:14:12,920
I'm flying blind
without a contrast CT here.

257
00:14:22,884 --> 00:14:27,409
And with a p value of less than .001,

258
00:14:27,554 --> 00:14:34,171
we have strong statistical evidence that
this drug prevents migraine headaches
without daily administration.

259
00:14:34,231 --> 00:14:36,461
Uh, excuse me, Doctor.

260
00:14:36,525 --> 00:14:38,248
He knows this field
better than you do.

261
00:14:38,332 --> 00:14:40,521
It's always been
my understanding that, uh,

262
00:14:40,573 --> 00:14:44,462
unless you follow a daily regimen,
no drug can prevent a migraine.

263
00:14:44,562 --> 00:14:46,256
That's why they call it
a breakthrough.

264
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,323
That's why YOU call it
a breakthrough.

265
00:14:48,572 --> 00:14:54,300
No, the, uh, pharmaceutical company
sponsoring my clinical trials
also hails it as a breakthrough.

266
00:14:54,384 --> 00:14:57,151
I'm sure your wife
and lawyer do too.

267
00:14:58,389 --> 00:15:02,138
Is there anybody who doesn't
stand to make a fortune from it,
calling it a breakthrough?

268
00:15:02,246 --> 00:15:03,096
Who are you?

269
00:15:03,213 --> 00:15:05,978
Just a lunatic who
desperately needs a hobby.

270
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,961
How exactly do
these studies work?

271
00:15:08,045 --> 00:15:09,921
Do you give this drug
to a bunch of people and

272
00:15:10,006 --> 00:15:13,358
they don't get a migraine,
you go, voila, my drug works?

273
00:15:13,722 --> 00:15:15,404
Uh, excuse me, Miss?

274
00:15:15,691 --> 00:15:17,637
Uh,  do you have cancer?

275
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:22,302
Wow. Mango juice
prevents cancer.

276
00:15:22,572 --> 00:15:25,502
Perhaps I should've
taken my medication
before this lecture.

277
00:15:25,657 --> 00:15:27,861
[Roars with laughter]

278
00:15:27,945 --> 00:15:30,354
Dr. Weber:
We had a very
specific control group.

279
00:15:30,438 --> 00:15:32,320
Chronic migraine sufferers.

280
00:15:32,383 --> 00:15:34,276
I don't have time to go through
all the math right now,

281
00:15:34,345 --> 00:15:38,283
- but the incidence was dramatically--
- Sure, in India.

282
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:41,189
Two plus two
equals five there, right?

283
00:15:42,244 --> 00:15:43,439
Do I know you?

284
00:15:43,523 --> 00:15:45,661
I know your math skills.

285
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:47,338
They blow.

286
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:48,798
Touché.

287
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:50,769
You sound very familiar.

288
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:53,724
Why did you publish it
in an obscure journal in India?

289
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:58,418
Why not publish in Really Really
Cool Head Cases of South Philly?

290
00:15:58,521 --> 00:16:01,058
Neuroscience New Delhi
is a respected journal.

291
00:16:01,122 --> 00:16:04,814
Yeah, the guy running
Slurp 'N' Gulp tells me
it's one of the best.

292
00:16:04,893 --> 00:16:06,574
Get a hooker.
Anything.

293
00:16:06,798 --> 00:16:08,302
See, I'm thinking that

294
00:16:08,556 --> 00:16:13,285
publishing studies is
probably the easiest way
to get a pharmaceutical company
to give you a reach-around.

295
00:16:13,359 --> 00:16:17,585
And choosing a journal that
no one can actually read,
well, that's, that's shrewd.

296
00:16:17,694 --> 00:16:19,309
I know I know you.

297
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,671
Sure  you do.

298
00:16:20,899 --> 00:16:21,902
Dick.

299
00:16:22,053 --> 00:16:23,131
The name's Philip.

300
00:16:23,246 --> 00:16:24,628
Oh, my bad.

301
00:16:24,727 --> 00:16:26,286
Something to do
with your face.

302
00:16:26,348 --> 00:16:28,274
I always think
your name is Dick.

303
00:16:28,628 --> 00:16:29,897
House?

304
00:16:30,007 --> 00:16:31,241
Here.

305
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,629
Medical school was 20 years ago.

306
00:16:34,723 --> 00:16:36,415
Give it a rest, grow up.

307
00:16:36,487 --> 00:16:39,915
Yeah, you were
always the grown-up,
do the responsible thing.

308
00:16:40,062 --> 00:16:41,516
Tattletale.

309
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,716
- You cheated.
- I cheated then,
you're cheating now.

310
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,935
Your drug doesn't work.

311
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:49,246
Oh, yes, you would like to believe that,
because it plays right into your fantasy--

312
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:51,356
- I tested it.
- Oh, really?

313
00:16:51,853 --> 00:16:53,917
What are your parameters?
Where's your study?

314
00:16:57,274 --> 00:16:58,937
Room 2134.

315
00:16:59,147 --> 00:17:00,074
One patient?

316
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,756
The coma patient?

317
00:17:02,761 --> 00:17:04,463
You haven't changed a bit.

318
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:09,464
You took short cuts in med school,
you're taking short cuts now.

319
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:12,847
You cannot test this
on an abnormal brain.

320
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:16,881
That's so closed-minded.
He's not abnormal, he's special.

321
00:17:16,956 --> 00:17:20,844
Cerebral cortex atrophies
in coma patients.

322
00:17:22,424 --> 00:17:25,334
You need live,
conscious people.

323
00:17:28,661 --> 00:17:30,498
You don't know
everything, House.

324
00:17:35,307 --> 00:17:37,720
It's something that
disrupts brain function.

325
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:41,547
Plaques are perfect.
Interrupt neuronal communication.

326
00:17:41,653 --> 00:17:42,830
-  M.S.?
- No.

327
00:17:43,143 --> 00:17:47,498
M.S. is complicated.
I think this is more basic.
It's just tachycardia and seizures.

328
00:17:47,935 --> 00:17:50,804
How much longer
the burn unit guys gonna
keep him in that thing?

329
00:17:51,106 --> 00:17:53,711
Lecture's over. Let's go.
House wants to...

330
00:17:56,872 --> 00:17:58,374
Adam's waking up.

331
00:17:59,047 --> 00:18:00,807
Get the anesthesiologist
in here now.

332
00:18:00,891 --> 00:18:02,351
Cameron:
He's in pain.

333
00:18:03,973 --> 00:18:05,424
That's not pain.

334
00:18:06,569 --> 00:18:08,107
Need some help in here.

335
00:18:08,882 --> 00:18:12,035
[Gasps for air]

336
00:19:10,193 --> 00:19:12,031
Adam had an orgasm.

337
00:19:13,761 --> 00:19:14,775
What?

338
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,525
You mean while he was--

339
00:19:18,485 --> 00:19:19,836
Oh!

340
00:19:20,365 --> 00:19:21,788
God!

341
00:19:23,087 --> 00:19:24,321
What's wrong?

342
00:19:26,145 --> 00:19:28,180
I'm having a migraine.

343
00:19:28,557 --> 00:19:29,869
Are you okay?

344
00:19:30,194 --> 00:19:32,793
Uh, yes.

345
00:19:34,512 --> 00:19:36,384
I was right.

346
00:19:37,967 --> 00:19:39,380
Oh!

347
00:19:46,857 --> 00:19:48,820
We'll knock you out
for a couple of hours.

348
00:19:48,885 --> 00:19:50,729
No, I got work to do.

349
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,610
Just gimme sumatriptan
for the pain and verapamil
so it doesn't recur.

350
00:19:59,937 --> 00:20:03,646
I heard the patient had fun
in the hyperbaric chamber.

351
00:20:03,795 --> 00:20:04,729
Yeah.

352
00:20:04,835 --> 00:20:07,095
Gotta schedule me
some time in there.

353
00:20:10,205 --> 00:20:12,706
Weber's meds aren't
even legal in the U.S.

354
00:20:13,388 --> 00:20:14,853
It's legal in India.

355
00:20:16,669 --> 00:20:18,389
I was disoriented.

356
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:26,349
Um, moving around
is a bad idea.

357
00:20:26,699 --> 00:20:29,178
Hey, if you feel chest pain,
you need to let me know.

358
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:31,898
Verapamil can cause
congestive heart failure.

359
00:20:32,405 --> 00:20:34,949
Nothing can hurt my heart.

360
00:20:37,557 --> 00:20:40,133
Foreman:
Hey, you're gonna
feel some dizziness.

361
00:20:40,244 --> 00:20:42,348
Definitely gonna be constipated.

362
00:20:46,297 --> 00:20:50,804
Differential diagnosis
for getting off.

363
00:20:51,014 --> 00:20:52,081
Is he gonna be okay?

364
00:20:52,165 --> 00:20:54,523
No, something's seriously
wrong with him.

365
00:20:54,607 --> 00:21:00,023
Differential diagnosis
for ejaculation.

366
00:21:01,472 --> 00:21:03,008
Don't make me say it again.

367
00:21:03,113 --> 00:21:05,281
We're not stalling,
we just don't know.

368
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:06,850
Then guess.

369
00:21:07,506 --> 00:21:09,657
Could pain medication
cause an orgasm?

370
00:21:09,741 --> 00:21:10,467
I wish.

371
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,231
Maybe pain
caused the orgasm.

372
00:21:12,383 --> 00:21:16,169
You get a tattoo,
the brain releases endorphins
which create pleasure.

373
00:21:16,253 --> 00:21:18,611
Most people don't orgasm
from a needle prick.

374
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:20,270
Well, Chase has a point.

375
00:21:20,381 --> 00:21:24,369
The brain is like
a huge train station.
If the switches--

376
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:26,634
Ow.

377
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,386
You're the neurologist,
talk for me.

378
00:21:29,536 --> 00:21:33,539
If sensory information
got misinterpreted by
the medial forebrain bundle,

379
00:21:33,611 --> 00:21:36,548
it's possible
for bad to feel good
and good to feel bad.

380
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:40,307
He's a lucky kid.
Let's not fix him
until the burns heal.

381
00:21:40,391 --> 00:21:42,328
So what attacks
the medial forebrain bundle?

382
00:21:42,412 --> 00:21:44,751
Infective neuropathies.
Vasculitic neuropathies.

383
00:21:44,835 --> 00:21:47,133
Krabbe's disease,
metachromatic leukodystrophy.

384
00:21:47,217 --> 00:21:49,735
House:
All very bad things.

385
00:21:50,081 --> 00:21:52,567
No way to look for
any of them in his condition.

386
00:21:52,714 --> 00:21:53,913
Could be an infection.

387
00:21:53,975 --> 00:21:55,741
I said infection
about eight seconds ago.

388
00:21:55,825 --> 00:21:57,374
You listed some
brain infections.

389
00:21:57,825 --> 00:22:02,305
But what if it's just
a regular old infection
festering in the burned skin?

390
00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:04,994
Pus on his arm isn't causing
problems in the forebrain.

391
00:22:05,078 --> 00:22:10,307
He's on 20 different medications
to manage his pain, his heart,
how often he urinates.

392
00:22:10,391 --> 00:22:13,192
His brain is like a waiter
that's got too many--

393
00:22:13,276 --> 00:22:14,090
Hey, hey.

394
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,071
I do the metaphors.

395
00:22:18,023 --> 00:22:19,506
The brain is stressed.

396
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,521
An infection elsewhere
could put it over the edge.

397
00:22:21,581 --> 00:22:24,556
So we just wait for his burns
to heal to see if you're right?

398
00:22:25,084 --> 00:22:27,426
If you're wrong, he doesn't
have that kind of time.

399
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:31,751
Dominic Larrey.

400
00:22:32,132 --> 00:22:33,696
He another dead doctor?

401
00:22:34,179 --> 00:22:37,001
He was Napoleon's Surgeon in Chief.

402
00:22:37,085 --> 00:22:38,617
Cleaned a lot of battle wounds.

403
00:22:38,701 --> 00:22:39,932
By amputating legs.

404
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:42,170
And with bugs.

405
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,371
Cameron:
Maggots are implanted
directly into Adam's burns.

406
00:22:50,663 --> 00:22:53,595
Maggots--eat dead people. I--

407
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,508
Maggots eat dead flesh.
Only dead flesh.

408
00:22:57,697 --> 00:23:00,146
So they're perfectly suited to clean wounds.

409
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:05,135
They also kill the bacteria
that thrive in injured tissues.

410
00:23:34,793 --> 00:23:35,945
Ho!

411
00:23:42,617 --> 00:23:45,560
Dr. Jekyll, I presume, they found
a half-eaten sheep in the zoo.

412
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:47,275
The police want to
ask you a few questions.

413
00:23:47,358 --> 00:23:48,937
I need something to wash it down.

414
00:23:49,354 --> 00:23:52,987
Coffee? Bad idea.
You're better off with water!

415
00:23:53,161 --> 00:23:54,774
Coffee's closer.

416
00:23:56,604 --> 00:23:58,393
Foolproof plan, by the way.

417
00:23:58,477 --> 00:24:00,200
Either his meds would work,

418
00:24:00,349 --> 00:24:05,175
and you'd be in psychic pain,
because Von Evil is gonna be rich.

419
00:24:06,137 --> 00:24:10,144
Or they wouldn't, and
you get to be in agony all day.

420
00:24:10,921 --> 00:24:13,856
Perfect lose/lose situation.
Very you.

421
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,260
I had to prove--

422
00:24:15,344 --> 00:24:16,855
You proved nothing.

423
00:24:19,266 --> 00:24:20,187
Right.

424
00:24:20,732 --> 00:24:22,504
This isn't a migraine.

425
00:24:22,931 --> 00:24:27,863
Yeah, Dear New England Journal of Medicine,
I took this guy's drug,
and still got a headache.

426
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:31,456
Thus scientifically proving that my arch enemy is an idiot.

427
00:24:31,685 --> 00:24:32,850
You just wanted the pain.

428
00:24:32,934 --> 00:24:36,149
The meds are supposed
to prevent migraine.

429
00:24:36,733 --> 00:24:40,709
You get distracted by pain.
Leaves less room for the things
you don't wanna think about.

430
00:24:41,088 --> 00:24:44,467
Like the Flyers sucking,
or the price of gas, or,

431
00:24:44,761 --> 00:24:47,717
oh, the fact that you pushed
the love of your life out of your life.

432
00:24:47,827 --> 00:24:50,684
God, I wish
the pain would go away.

433
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,704
Next time you need to
get your mind off her,
stick a needle in your eye.

434
00:24:53,788 --> 00:24:56,257
It's less annoying to the rest of us
when you can still walk.

435
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:06,398
Did you sleep here?

436
00:25:10,238 --> 00:25:11,834
Lower.

437
00:25:12,421 --> 00:25:14,144
Do you want a pillow?

438
00:25:14,949 --> 00:25:17,132
Not softer, lower.

439
00:25:17,354 --> 00:25:19,845
The frequency of your voice is grating.

440
00:25:19,929 --> 00:25:21,626
You should've been better by now.

441
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:23,185
I'm super.

442
00:25:23,705 --> 00:25:24,882
The patient?

443
00:25:25,463 --> 00:25:27,264
The maggots did great for the burn.

444
00:25:27,523 --> 00:25:30,292
But the brainwaves are
still all over the map.

445
00:25:30,376 --> 00:25:34,597
Which means your regular old infection
isn't causing his brain dysfunction.

446
00:25:34,723 --> 00:25:38,966
Which means there's an underlying condition.
Which means we gotta get inside his head.

447
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,997
Do a lumbar puncture.

448
00:25:41,186 --> 00:25:43,370
We've already established
that we can't get a lumbar--

449
00:25:43,454 --> 00:25:45,491
C2, C3.

450
00:25:45,789 --> 00:25:48,320
No, no, no way.

451
00:25:48,496 --> 00:25:51,636
I only saw a cervical tap once,
and that guy got paralyzed.

452
00:25:51,873 --> 00:25:56,776
Ask the parents
if they prefer to have their son
in a wheelchair, or dead.

453
00:26:00,758 --> 00:26:03,430
Something's causing
his brain to lose control.

454
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:05,601
Eventually it will shut off.

455
00:26:05,685 --> 00:26:10,183
We need to do a lumbar puncture
to get some of the fluid in his spine
so we can test it.

456
00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:12,195
You need us to sign a consent?

457
00:26:12,424 --> 00:26:13,955
I have to warn you.

458
00:26:14,263 --> 00:26:17,771
There's a serious risk of
paralysis or death.

459
00:26:18,227 --> 00:26:20,058
Are you saying
we shouldn't do this?

460
00:26:20,723 --> 00:26:21,906
You have to do this.

461
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,938
Then why are you telling us
what can go wrong?

462
00:26:24,022 --> 00:26:25,126
I just think you should know.

463
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:28,912
Either you're cruel or this clipboard
is a way for you to cover your ass
in case you cripple our son.

464
00:26:29,018 --> 00:26:31,370
- This isn't his fault--
- No, it's not, it's yours.

465
00:26:31,454 --> 00:26:32,960
That's what you
keep telling me.

466
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:37,259
My son is lying in there
half dead. I am just trying to
find a way to get through this.

467
00:26:38,127 --> 00:26:40,753
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, I know.

468
00:27:00,222 --> 00:27:01,129
Needle.

469
00:27:16,753 --> 00:27:19,007
- It's not going in.
- Don't force it.

470
00:27:19,709 --> 00:27:20,898
I'm going one space higher.

471
00:27:20,982 --> 00:27:23,572
It's too close to his brain stem,
it'll herniate.

472
00:27:24,503 --> 00:27:26,484
- You're gonna paralyze him.
- Not helping.

473
00:27:26,568 --> 00:27:27,693
[Monitars start beeping]

474
00:27:27,757 --> 00:27:29,500
His blood pressure's spiking.
Stop.

475
00:27:29,584 --> 00:27:30,278
I can get it.

476
00:27:30,346 --> 00:27:33,093
He's 180 over 120.
He's gonna stroke.

477
00:27:34,676 --> 00:27:36,949
I'm in the space.
Gimme the vial.

478
00:27:46,266 --> 00:27:50,026
[Monitars stops beeping
and go back to normal]

479
00:27:54,629 --> 00:27:57,108
He doesn't have M.S.
or an infection.

480
00:27:59,108 --> 00:28:01,204
His proteins aren't elevated?

481
00:28:01,467 --> 00:28:04,362
Wrong protein.
IgM, not IgG.

482
00:28:04,491 --> 00:28:06,821
Elevation was probably
caused by the bleeding.

483
00:28:08,721 --> 00:28:12,917
What if there was tingling
in his extremities prior
to the crash?

484
00:28:13,332 --> 00:28:14,940
How can you still be on M.S.?

485
00:28:15,024 --> 00:28:16,591
You gotta be on something.

486
00:28:17,507 --> 00:28:21,265
Something's interrupting
his neurons' chit-chat.
Like lesions.

487
00:28:21,391 --> 00:28:23,029
We can't scan for them.

488
00:28:23,172 --> 00:28:26,170
Only test we can do we just did,
and it was negative.

489
00:28:26,446 --> 00:28:28,469
He has no tingling,
no numbness.

490
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:31,072
You read his history.
Parents didn't say anything about--

491
00:28:31,156 --> 00:28:32,729
What about Adam?

492
00:28:34,111 --> 00:28:37,331
We can't look into his brain,
but you want us to read his mind?

493
00:28:38,977 --> 00:28:40,333
Good point.

494
00:28:49,805 --> 00:28:52,357
Yeah, you can finish
the sponge bath in a minute.

495
00:28:52,441 --> 00:28:54,258
They're just redoing his dressings.

496
00:28:54,376 --> 00:28:55,859
He's out, he's fine.

497
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:59,415
I didn't page you to put him out,
I paged you to wake him up.

498
00:28:59,816 --> 00:29:01,969
Why are these lights
so damn bright?

499
00:29:02,823 --> 00:29:04,110
Thank you.

500
00:29:04,266 --> 00:29:06,135
Come on, I need to talk to him.

501
00:29:06,329 --> 00:29:09,102
House, you can't
wake up a burn victim
to play 20 Questions.

502
00:29:09,162 --> 00:29:11,049
- It's torture.
- He won't remember.

503
00:29:11,133 --> 00:29:12,894
He's gonna be
in extraordinary pain--

504
00:29:12,978 --> 00:29:15,686
God, you're good.
You're putting me to sleep.

505
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:21,043
I know he's gonna be in pain,
I know you disapprove,
I'm his attending, wake him up.

506
00:29:38,195 --> 00:29:41,729
Mmm...Oh, my God.

507
00:29:41,829 --> 00:29:43,221
I'm Dr. House.

508
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:44,489
It hurts!

509
00:29:44,718 --> 00:29:46,668
It's gonna get a lot worse,
so answer fast.

510
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:51,111
Before the accident,
did you experience any numbness
or any tingling in your fingers?

511
00:29:51,554 --> 00:29:53,813
You got burnt, it's healing,
I need an answer.

512
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:55,172
Ow! It really hurts!

513
00:29:55,238 --> 00:29:57,492
Any tingling in your arms or legs?

514
00:29:57,576 --> 00:29:58,813
Do something! I can't--

515
00:29:58,875 --> 00:30:01,751
Adam, you gotta listen to me.
Did you feel anything?

516
00:30:03,328 --> 00:30:08,931
I pissed my pants
and then I don't...remember--

517
00:30:10,812 --> 00:30:14,194
Ahh! Ahhhh!

518
00:30:47,776 --> 00:30:49,008
Is he okay?

519
00:30:49,092 --> 00:30:50,932
Get everyone in my office.

520
00:30:51,776 --> 00:30:52,921
Where are you going?

521
00:30:53,611 --> 00:30:55,613
Kid's screaming
gave me a headache.

522
00:30:55,784 --> 00:30:57,409
I gotta take an aspirin.

523
00:31:56,512 --> 00:31:57,637
House.

524
00:31:58,165 --> 00:32:00,041
You okay?
We've been waiting for you.

525
00:32:04,446 --> 00:32:06,783
I'm hallucinating.

526
00:32:09,578 --> 00:32:12,262
Hallucinations with migraines
are pretty uncommon.

527
00:32:13,481 --> 00:32:15,003
What'd you see?

528
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,154
I saw music.

529
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,517
Sensory deception
makes no sense.

530
00:32:20,586 --> 00:32:21,884
Shh...

531
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:28,000
You took something.
[Sounds hollow]

532
00:32:28,116 --> 00:32:31,050
The kid's fighting for his life.

533
00:32:35,654 --> 00:32:37,737
<i># Get miles away #</i>

534
00:32:38,298 --> 00:32:40,844
<i># Get miles away #</i>

535
00:32:41,146 --> 00:32:43,603
<i># Get miles away #</i>

536
00:32:43,997 --> 00:32:46,660
<i># Get miles away #</i>

537
00:32:46,946 --> 00:32:49,628
<i># Get miles away #</i>

538
00:32:49,937 --> 00:32:52,593
<i># Get miles away #</i>

539
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,583
<i># Get miles #</i>

540
00:32:58,278 --> 00:32:59,347
Hey, you find him?

541
00:32:59,447 --> 00:33:01,394
He was hallucinating
in the locker room.

542
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:03,107
He okay?

543
00:33:03,226 --> 00:33:04,990
He's feeling no pain,
he's high.

544
00:33:05,052 --> 00:33:06,387
Vicodin high?

545
00:33:06,471 --> 00:33:08,936
Past that.
He's seeing sounds.

546
00:33:09,322 --> 00:33:10,585
Took something.

547
00:33:13,892 --> 00:33:16,487
Why is it so dark in here?
Beautiful day outside.

548
00:33:16,579 --> 00:33:19,099
Open the shades.
Let the sunshine in.

549
00:33:19,242 --> 00:33:20,866
It's nighttime.

550
00:33:22,554 --> 00:33:23,929
It's still Tuesday, right?

551
00:33:23,996 --> 00:33:25,109
You look better.

552
00:33:25,947 --> 00:33:26,966
I took something.

553
00:33:27,237 --> 00:33:28,698
Mind if I ask what?

554
00:33:29,021 --> 00:33:32,007
Uh, little of this,
little of that.

555
00:33:32,354 --> 00:33:34,151
I know what's wrong
with our patient.

556
00:33:34,336 --> 00:33:35,879
He's depressed.

557
00:33:36,031 --> 00:33:37,685
- He told you that
when you woke him up?
- No,

558
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,528
he told me he pissed his pants
and blacked out.

559
00:33:39,612 --> 00:33:41,222
That's not a diagnostic
of depression.

560
00:33:41,322 --> 00:33:42,666
Lack of appetite.
Isolating yourself--

561
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:46,105
Uncontrollable urination
and blacking out are
good predictors of what?

562
00:33:46,189 --> 00:33:46,808
Seizure.

563
00:33:46,906 --> 00:33:50,760
Which means the seizure he had
when you tested his heart was
at least his second seizure.

564
00:33:50,844 --> 00:33:53,692
So what?
Depression and seizures
aren't correlated.

565
00:33:53,776 --> 00:33:55,829
No, but you know what is?

566
00:33:56,169 --> 00:33:58,787
Depression and
anti-depression medicine.

567
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:00,271
Tox screen was clean.

568
00:34:00,626 --> 00:34:03,944
Yeah, but you know how much crap
he's got in his system for
dealing with those burns.

569
00:34:04,028 --> 00:34:07,913
The guy could have the Spanish Armada
floating through his bloodstream,
we wouldn't know about it,

570
00:34:08,098 --> 00:34:09,585
'til they started firing cannons.

571
00:34:09,669 --> 00:34:13,350
Antidepressants have been
known to cause seizures in kids,
but not orgasms.

572
00:34:13,434 --> 00:34:14,561
This is a brain in trouble.

573
00:34:14,645 --> 00:34:17,579
This is a brain with
too much serotonin.

574
00:34:17,663 --> 00:34:21,483
Serotonin affects mood,
appetite. It doesn't cause
a brain to shut down.

575
00:34:21,548 --> 00:34:26,032
Antidepressants fake brains into
thinking they have more serotonin
than they actually do.

576
00:34:26,116 --> 00:34:29,723
Every 10 million or so cases,
it sets off a chain reaction.

577
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:32,617
It produces too much,
enough to fry itself.

578
00:34:32,683 --> 00:34:35,036
If Adam has
Serotonin Storm,
it's deadly.

579
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,255
But treatable.
Cyproheptadine.

580
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:39,047
Unless he doesn't have
Serotonin Storm.

581
00:34:39,106 --> 00:34:41,434
He could just as easily have
too much dopamine as serotonin.

582
00:34:41,518 --> 00:34:44,276
But if it's dopamine,
the cyproheptadine will kill him.

583
00:34:45,348 --> 00:34:46,118
Where are you going?

584
00:34:46,202 --> 00:34:48,343
I'm gonna
talk to the kid again.
Seems nice.

585
00:34:48,438 --> 00:34:49,389
You can't.

586
00:34:50,106 --> 00:34:51,620
Why? Did he say
he doesn't like me?

587
00:34:51,725 --> 00:34:54,188
The anesthesiologist told
the parents what you did.

588
00:34:54,966 --> 00:34:56,953
Everyone's a tattletale.

589
00:35:03,395 --> 00:35:05,332
Is your son depressed?

590
00:35:06,887 --> 00:35:08,178
No, who are you?

591
00:35:08,262 --> 00:35:09,374
I'm Dr. House.

592
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:10,334
Oh, you're the idiot who--

593
00:35:10,418 --> 00:35:12,380
I heard him screaming
all the way down the hallway.

594
00:35:12,464 --> 00:35:14,943
If I didn't wake him up,
I wouldn't have learned
what caused the crash.

595
00:35:15,229 --> 00:35:16,663
I think he had a seizure.

596
00:35:19,524 --> 00:35:21,928
Th-this wasn't my fault?

597
00:35:23,343 --> 00:35:26,434
Well, if he hadn't had
the brain problem,
he wouldn't have the burns.

598
00:35:26,536 --> 00:35:29,739
On the other hand,
if you hadn't put him on the ATV,
he also wouldn't have the burns.

599
00:35:29,823 --> 00:35:32,173
You can debate
your personal responsibility
after I leave.

600
00:35:32,257 --> 00:35:33,505
I need to wake him up again.

601
00:35:33,645 --> 00:35:35,825
I need to know if he's
taking anti-depressants.

602
00:35:35,825 --> 00:35:36,974
He's not.

603
00:35:37,852 --> 00:35:39,353
He's the happiest kid I know.

604
00:35:39,412 --> 00:35:40,975
But you don't know, do you?

605
00:35:43,835 --> 00:35:44,843
He's my son.

606
00:35:44,948 --> 00:35:47,253
Mmm, that's sort of my point.

607
00:35:47,495 --> 00:35:49,800
At 16, they'll tell
anyone anything.

608
00:35:49,884 --> 00:35:51,063
Except their parents.

609
00:35:51,147 --> 00:35:52,609
Adam talks to us about everything.

610
00:35:52,715 --> 00:35:54,922
Yeah, I know about
the pot and the cocaine.

611
00:35:55,006 --> 00:35:57,654
- There was never cocaine--
- You sure?

612
00:35:57,983 --> 00:35:59,664
You having him followed?

613
00:35:59,976 --> 00:36:02,535
He told us when
he got drunk at a party.

614
00:36:02,604 --> 00:36:04,516
He told us when
he started having sex.

615
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,323
16, way to go.

616
00:36:06,407 --> 00:36:07,864
He told us when
he cheated on a math test.

617
00:36:07,975 --> 00:36:10,243
He told us when
his girlfriend cheated on him.

618
00:36:10,318 --> 00:36:11,977
He doesn't hide
anything from us.

619
00:36:12,061 --> 00:36:14,612
- But if he was depressed?
- He'd tell us.

620
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:17,825
We don't judge.
He's not depressed,
we're sure.

621
00:36:18,165 --> 00:36:20,402
"Bet his life on it" sure?

622
00:36:22,017 --> 00:36:23,464
Just hypothetically.

623
00:36:25,236 --> 00:36:26,403
Yeah.

624
00:36:29,745 --> 00:36:31,504
Okay.

625
00:36:33,928 --> 00:36:35,422
Kid's happy.

626
00:36:36,315 --> 00:36:38,360
Happy, happy, happy.

627
00:36:38,491 --> 00:36:41,512
Then we're back to
where we started,
seizure disorders.

628
00:36:42,029 --> 00:36:44,979
Seizure disorders aren't
causing orgasms.

629
00:36:45,063 --> 00:36:46,654
Vascular malformations.

630
00:36:46,982 --> 00:36:48,752
Would've seen it
on the sonogram.

631
00:36:48,854 --> 00:36:50,521
Hepatic encephalopathy?

632
00:36:51,041 --> 00:36:53,296
Liver enzyme tests were normal.

633
00:36:59,336 --> 00:37:00,322
Where are you going?

634
00:37:00,406 --> 00:37:01,876
Take a leak.

635
00:37:09,823 --> 00:37:10,798
What are you doing?

636
00:37:10,882 --> 00:37:12,052
Can't come in here.

637
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:12,914
You're not sterile.

638
00:37:12,998 --> 00:37:14,173
Don't touch our son,
we told you.

639
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:17,054
Seriously,
millions of bacteria,
microbes on you.

640
00:37:17,158 --> 00:37:18,199
He'll die of sepsis.

641
00:37:18,347 --> 00:37:19,850
If you go in there...

642
00:37:23,974 --> 00:37:25,488
I think he's gonna wake him up again.

643
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:27,014
I know he is.

644
00:37:28,928 --> 00:37:30,776
House, you can't do this.

645
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:33,969
Oh, if I had a nickel
for every time I've heard that.

646
00:37:34,261 --> 00:37:36,334
Relax. They gonna sue us?

647
00:37:36,562 --> 00:37:38,677
If I'm right,
I save his life.

648
00:37:38,776 --> 00:37:41,900
If I'm wrong,
he's dead no matter what I do.

649
00:37:41,984 --> 00:37:44,097
Either way, how much
have I really hurt them?

650
00:37:44,912 --> 00:37:46,471
Leave him alone!

651
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:48,473
You're not sterile.
You wanna kill the kid?

652
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:49,859
Give me the syringe.

653
00:37:49,926 --> 00:37:53,209
- No pain, no gain.
- Hey, you gotta stop this.

654
00:37:57,004 --> 00:37:58,313
You're right.

655
00:37:59,495 --> 00:38:02,011
- He's not depressed.
- Yeah, sure.

656
00:38:02,286 --> 00:38:04,814
I'm not letting you go
until you give me that syringe.

657
00:38:04,959 --> 00:38:06,565
What's that on his wrist?

658
00:38:08,047 --> 00:38:09,112
A burn.

659
00:38:09,262 --> 00:38:11,498
- Why on his wrist?
- Why not on his wrist?

660
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:15,523
His back, his torso,
everything's a mess.
His forearms are clean.

661
00:38:15,733 --> 00:38:16,814
Except right there.

662
00:38:16,897 --> 00:38:18,092
So what?

663
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:20,621
It's a perfect circle.

664
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,657
So a drop of burning gasoline
fell on his wrist.
A screw from the ATV.

665
00:38:25,726 --> 00:38:27,031
Maybe.

666
00:38:36,945 --> 00:38:38,445
Why are you torturing him?

667
00:38:38,511 --> 00:38:40,088
Does your son smoke?

668
00:38:41,205 --> 00:38:42,547
I'd kill him.

669
00:38:44,642 --> 00:38:47,361
So he talked to you
about sex, crack.

670
00:38:47,445 --> 00:38:49,289
Anything except cigarettes.

671
00:38:50,285 --> 00:38:52,733
He has a cigarette burn
on his wrist.

672
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:57,100
Also a fading nicotine stain
between two fingers.

673
00:38:57,399 --> 00:39:00,596
Bad news, you son has
a filthy, unhealthy habit.

674
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,065
Good news,
he's trying to quit.

675
00:39:03,122 --> 00:39:05,317
Bad news,
the quitting's killing him.

676
00:39:05,401 --> 00:39:07,031
Good news,
I can cure him.

677
00:39:07,114 --> 00:39:08,358
Bad news...

678
00:39:09,668 --> 00:39:11,308
nope, that's the end of it.

679
00:39:12,022 --> 00:39:13,735
Quitting smoking can kill?

680
00:39:13,987 --> 00:39:16,301
No-smoke meds are
anti-depressants.

681
00:39:16,404 --> 00:39:18,510
The crappy ones
you get over the Internet.

682
00:39:18,615 --> 00:39:21,222
They're loaded with
whatever anti-depressants
they can get cheap.

683
00:39:21,326 --> 00:39:24,586
Since Mommy and Daddy
obviously didn't take him
to a pediatrician...

684
00:39:28,007 --> 00:39:30,670
Sorry, I was wrong
about him being depressed.

685
00:39:31,568 --> 00:39:32,711
Treat him.

686
00:39:51,035 --> 00:39:52,502
Cuddy:
Hey.

687
00:39:53,321 --> 00:39:56,034
Did you drop acid?

688
00:39:57,146 --> 00:39:58,644
Why would I do that?

689
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,019
To annoy me.

690
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,470
Or maybe because
you're miserable.

691
00:40:02,554 --> 00:40:06,085
Or because you
wanna self-destruct.

692
00:40:06,245 --> 00:40:07,428
Pick one.

693
00:40:08,028 --> 00:40:14,468
How 'bout because LSD acts
on serotonin receptors in the brain,
which can stop a migraine in its tracks.

694
00:40:15,394 --> 00:40:17,735
I'm just saying
it's also a possibility.

695
00:40:17,944 --> 00:40:20,634
- How did you know--
- Cameron is worried about you.

696
00:40:21,433 --> 00:40:25,113
I told her that
LSD lasts up to 12 hours.
If you were functional,
she must be wrong.

697
00:40:25,197 --> 00:40:30,381
Either that, or I also took
a whole bunch of anti-depressants,
which short-circuited the LSD.

698
00:40:30,524 --> 00:40:32,103
I'm just saying
that would also explain it.

699
00:40:32,289 --> 00:40:34,712
Thank you for
ruining my clinical trials.

700
00:40:34,712 --> 00:40:36,778
Pharmaceutical company's
shutting me down.

701
00:40:36,837 --> 00:40:37,868
You're kidding, really?

702
00:40:37,952 --> 00:40:38,919
How could that surprise you?

703
00:40:39,028 --> 00:40:41,325
You sent them an email
complaining about my math.

704
00:40:41,409 --> 00:40:42,826
Telling them about your stunt.

705
00:40:42,978 --> 00:40:45,184
I didn't know
people actually read emails.

706
00:40:45,268 --> 00:40:47,072
Delete button is
so conveniently located--

707
00:40:47,156 --> 00:40:47,931
So what's next?

708
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,449
You gonna follow me
my whole life, torture me?

709
00:40:50,516 --> 00:40:51,475
Why would I do that?

710
00:40:51,579 --> 00:40:53,092
You waited 20 years to do this.

711
00:40:53,157 --> 00:40:55,488
What's next?
Break up my marriage?

712
00:40:56,528 --> 00:40:58,946
No. We're even.

713
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:00,231
Right.

714
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:04,553
Oh, thanks for
setting me up.

715
00:41:07,813 --> 00:41:11,190
Eye for an eye,
LSD, and antidepressants,

716
00:41:11,982 --> 00:41:13,860
everything in balance.

717
00:41:13,944 --> 00:41:18,654
Buddhists call it Karma,
Christians call it the Golden Rule,
Jews call it...

718
00:41:20,549 --> 00:41:21,242
I don't know.

719
00:41:21,569 --> 00:41:23,993
Rabbi Hillel said
something poignant.

720
00:41:25,324 --> 00:41:28,122
Universe always
settles the score.

721
00:41:28,535 --> 00:41:29,644
Does it?

722
00:41:30,515 --> 00:41:31,396
No.

723
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:34,568
But it should.

724
00:41:42,046 --> 00:41:45,385
Do you think you'll ever
be able to look at him
and not blame me?

725
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:50,676
Yeah. Will you?

726
00:42:19,607 --> 00:42:21,125
[Knocking on the door]

727
00:42:41,848 --> 00:42:43,265
I'm Paula.

728
00:42:43,633 --> 00:42:44,944
Hey, Paula.

729
00:42:45,326 --> 00:42:46,582
How you doing?

730
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:50,755
You work over at the college?
Or are you full time over at--

731
00:42:50,811 --> 00:42:53,005
I'm looking
for a distraction.

732
00:42:53,852 --> 00:42:56,711
You don't need to talk
to do that, do you?

733
00:43:04,049 --> 00:43:05,704
