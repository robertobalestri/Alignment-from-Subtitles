1
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:07,407
Previously on ER.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,109
Well, grandma?, if
that is all you think of me

3
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:10,476
then you can keep your money.

4
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:11,512
As you wish, John.

5
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:12,813
Cancer's back.

6
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,148
Your bone marrow...
failed to match

7
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:17,183
the last two
potential donors.

8
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:19,152
I don't want any more chemo.

9
00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:22,222
Gather all
the charts and the tape.

10
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:23,456
The tape?

11
00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:25,626
We frequently tape
laparoscopic procedures.

12
00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:27,327
Don't pull
so hard with the babcock.

13
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,662
You'll tear
the gastric artery.

14
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,531
‐ I'm not pulling.
‐ Oh, son of a bitch!

15
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:31,632
He's lost too
much blood. We've got to open.

16
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:33,433
We're losin' him.

17
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:34,535
Dr.Morgenstern, it's
been three minutes!

18
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:36,036
He's dying. Move!

19
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:46,346
Cubs fan, huh?

20
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,413
Please don't touch that.

21
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:48,582
Right. Sorry.

22
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:52,352
Before I
make any decisions

23
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,555
regarding your loan
application, Dr. Carter

24
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:56,690
I have to
clarify a few points.

25
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,291
Yeah?

26
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:01,862
You only included
one tax return, 1996

27
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:05,265
listing your income
as a surgical resident

28
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:07,834
with an annual
salary of $28,000?

29
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:10,470
Yeah, before taxes.

30
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:11,672
We'll need
your other returns

31
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:13,707
from previous years.

32
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,577
There aren't any. Before
that, I was a med student.

33
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,211
No summer jobs?

34
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:22,649
Well, I, uh, crewed
in the Whitbread in 1990.

35
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:24,250
Where was that?

36
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:26,887
Cape Town, Freemantle.

37
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,855
Capsized between
Sydney and Auckland.

38
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:32,358
It's a yacht race.

39
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:34,127
And you earned...?

40
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,429
Ah, a few thousand..

41
00:01:36,462 --> 00:01:40,433
...but after living expenses..

42
00:01:40,466 --> 00:01:42,435
I, uh, I spent more than I made.

43
00:01:42,468 --> 00:01:43,537
You're a resident

44
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,672
in emergency medicine now.

45
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:47,207
Is that correct?

46
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,374
Yeah.

47
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:49,776
When I shifted from surgery

48
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,246
I agreed to do so without pay

49
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:56,349
but I'm gonna ask for a
paycheck next year for sure.

50
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:58,919
I would hope so.

51
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,621
What about this trust fund?

52
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:03,890
The holdings are in
my grandfather's name

53
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:07,260
and I am no longer
drawing funds from it.

54
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,662
Would your grandfather
be willing to cosign

55
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:10,163
for your loan?

56
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:11,732
You know, I‐I want my
application to be judged

57
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:13,366
on its own merits.

58
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:14,768
On its own merits,
I'm gonna have to reject it.

59
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,202
Why?

60
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:17,538
'I think you should
either talk'

61
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:19,239
to your grandfather
or acquaint yourself

62
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:20,541
with the ingredients
of a peanut butter

63
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:22,442
and jelly sandwich.

64
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:24,611
Peter.

65
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,547
Oh, Dr. Morgenstern.

66
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,915
I, um, I
looked over your report

67
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:31,618
for the Morbidity and
Mortality conference.

68
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:35,288
It...it was quite evenhanded.

69
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,924
Well, I just
charted what happened.

70
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:41,361
Sometimes these things can
become so "he said, she said"

71
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:42,629
but there's
no need for that.

72
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:43,864
No, no.

73
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:45,365
Contact the journals.

74
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:47,300
Lizzie and I just did
an aortobifemoral bypass

75
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,334
in two hours, 20 minutes.

76
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,571
Well, that's wonderful, Robert.

77
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:52,472
So, is M&M still on,
or can I buy Lizzie

78
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:53,707
'a well‐earned five egg omelet?'

79
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,509
No, it's still on.

80
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,911
Huh, looks like you're not out
of the hot seat yet, uh, Peter?

81
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:59,646
'Will Anspaugh
be joining us?'

82
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,716
No. He requested that I
messenger the meeting notes

83
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:03,817
over to his house.

84
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,686
‐ Is the funeral today?
‐ Yeah.

85
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:08,288
I sent flowers
from the department.

86
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:12,258
Well, looks like
a cruller and a Coke

87
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:13,827
is all we have time for.

88
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,195
My treat.

89
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:24,004
♪ 'Tis a gift to be simple
'tis a gift to be free ♪

90
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:29,943
♪ 'Tis a gift to come

91
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:35,348

93
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:41,782
Hey, Mark?
I'm going to a surgical M&M.

94
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:42,916
Can you
cover for an hour?

95
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,518
Sure. No
problem. What's going on?

96
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:46,086
It's the
Swanson laparoscopy.

97
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,521
Oh, right,
Peter's case.

98
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:49,422
No, it's
actually Dr. Morgenstern.

99
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,692
Right. Well, have fun.
I will hold down the fort.

100
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:52,826
Thank you.

101
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:53,960
‐ I thought you said..
‐ Hi!

102
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:55,495
I thought you
said he was the best.

103
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:57,097
He is. He
rolled over my med school loan

104
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,032
into some kind of
Sallie Mae, Fannie Mae

105
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:00,501
Ellie Mae, whatever.

106
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:01,702
All I
know is I don't have to eat

107
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:02,736
every meal out of a can anymore.

108
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,004
'Hey, Carter'

109
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,606
you catch
that Sox game last night?

110
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,640
Missed it.

111
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:08,341
Center fielder, pop fly

112
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:10,110
catching a few z's. Pay up.

113
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,712
I'm a little short
right now. Can I get you?

114
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:13,814
Yeah, sure. I know
you're good for it.

115
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:17,751
Hey, I had an aunt who made a
killing selling Tupperware.

116
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:18,952
Tupperware.

117
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,821
They're those
plastic storage things‐‐

118
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:22,455
Oh, I know what
Tupperware is, Anna.

119
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,790
How about, uh, Amway?

120
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:24,991
You're really
enjoying this, aren't you?

121
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:26,793
Yeah, a little.

122
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:27,961
Heads up, doctors.

123
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,996
'Carter, you're up.'

124
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,032
This day keeps getting
better and better, doesn't it?

125
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:33,934
Alright, Grabarsky,
who you got?

126
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:36,970
Mike Lembreaux hasn't grasped
the know‐when‐to‐say‐when thing.

127
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,004
'Fell over a curb.'

128
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:39,706
Uh, curbs, huh, Mr. Lembreaux?

129
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,041
Maybe we should
have those removed.

130
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,676
His wrist
looks pretty bad.

131
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:43,744
From the smell of things

132
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:46,112
we can skip
the pain medication.

133
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:48,715
Let's go check out
that wrist, Mr. Lembreaux.

134
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:51,952
I wanted to eulogize
him somehow, but I, uh..

135
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,858
I never felt comfortable
in his mother's church.

136
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:59,359
So austere.

137
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:02,729
No pomp and ceremony

138
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:06,099
just...silent judgment.

139
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:11,437
I thought the silence
was for contemplation.

140
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:15,075
It's just...well.

141
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,477
You could imagine how
her Quaker parents felt

142
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:19,880
when she brought
home a west point man.

143
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,852
Well, you ended up
getting married.

144
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,020
Yeah.

145
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:30,490
The hawk and the dove.

146
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:34,995
Long time ago.

147
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:45,138
Scotty...wanted you to
have the stuff in this box.

148
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:50,677
Green Day.

149
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:55,481
Surprised he didn't
burn a hole through this one.

150
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:00,854
What?

151
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:02,923
"Soap Opera Digest."

152
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:08,629
I knew he was getting those
future plots from somewhere.

153
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:11,932
Finally, let's remember
the most important aspect of M&M

154
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:14,167
is not to linger
on our missteps

155
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,503
but to analyze
every case as a teaching tool.

156
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:20,073
Dr. Benton.

157
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:30,817
Thank you.

158
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:32,018
Probably gonna to need
a reduction.

159
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:33,219
I'm thinking open reduction

160
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:34,821
and internal
fixation in the OR.

161
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:36,222
Not so fast. We don't need
surgery anymore..

162
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:37,658
'Go away!'

163
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:38,692
'Yeah, I
got my real'

164
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:39,860
ones knocked out..

165
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:41,161
‐ Please help him.
‐ In Joliet.

166
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:42,195
‐ He can't breathe!
‐ 'Hey, hey, hey.'

167
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,630
He can't breathe.

168
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:44,931
Hey, I'm just showing
him a thing or two.

169
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,499
Keep breathing
on the nebulizer.

170
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:48,001
Hey, Mr. Lembreaux, why
don't you leave this kid‐‐

171
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,570
Get him out of here!
Will you get him out of here?

172
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:50,604
Put your teeth
back in your mouth.

173
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:51,705
Hey, I got
a talking right.

174
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:52,739
Can talk to anybody I want.

175
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:54,074
Deep breaths, alright?

176
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:55,208
You can't
tell me what to do.

177
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:57,143
You better leave
me alone before I...

178
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:59,045
Hey, hey, hey!

179
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:01,181
Guys, get some
soft restraints!

180
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:02,716
Leave me alone!

181
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:03,750
Leave me alone!

182
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:06,119
Stop it! Leave me alone.

183
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,187
Please help him!

184
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,022
Okay, buddy.
Here we go.

185
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:10,557
Come on, buddy,
you're gonna be fine.

186
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:11,958
He's cyanotic.
I'm going to intubate him.

187
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,126
His right
wrist, it might be broken.

188
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,194
John, I'm going to intubate him.

189
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:16,697
Give me 40 of ketamine.

190
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:17,731
What the
hell are you doing bringing

191
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:18,832
a psycho in here with a kid?

192
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,534
Sorry. I didn't realize.

193
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:22,603
The boy is
a critical asthma patient.

194
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:24,938
Nobody gives a damn
about pedes. 5.0 ET Tube.

195
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,039
I'm really sorry.

196
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:27,908
Give me suction.

197
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:28,975
Dr. Morgenstern's attempt

198
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,777
to control the hemorrhage

199
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:32,245
by midline incision was futile.

200
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,247
Variceal bleeding
obscured the operative field.

201
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,149
‐ We were getting it in control.
‐ Okay?

202
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,084
'It was difficult to find
the bleeding site.'

203
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:39,586
What did you do next?

204
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,787
Called for additional suction.

205
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:42,823
After which, you decided
to change course

206
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:43,957
and open the chest.

207
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,559
And who made that incision?

208
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:49,930
I did.

209
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:50,964
Dr. Morgenstern
allowed you

210
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,298
to crack the chest?

211
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:53,600
‐ Well, not exactly.
‐ Well, actually..

212
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:54,635
...I didn't feel it was..

213
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:56,937
'Gentlemen?
One at a time.'

214
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,071
Dr. Benton?

215
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:02,342
I, uh, I took over the surgery.

216
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,677
'What do you mean take over?'

217
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,778
How could you take over?

218
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:06,913
In the, uh, heat of the moment

219
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:08,715
Dr. Benton became agitated.

220
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:09,783
'Dr. Benton?'

221
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,687
I pushed him aside.

222
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,721
'Peter, what
was your justification'

223
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:16,022
for such an action?

224
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,624
‐ The man was bleeding out.
‐ 'And?'

225
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:19,760
Actually, the
midline incision was adequate.

226
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:21,728
‐ It was the varices.
‐ No.

227
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:23,630
The man needed
to be cracked immediately.

228
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:25,999
And that justifies committing
battery on your superior?

229
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,334
The man was dying. What would
you do? Stood there and watched?

230
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:30,604
I would have assisted the
attending in saving his life.

231
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:32,272
Okay, after three minutes
of arterial bleeding

232
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,741
and profound shock,
cross‐clamping the aorta

233
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:36,276
was the only alternative.

234
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,378
No, Peter, I don't think
it was the only alternative.

235
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,213
No. It was
the only alternative. If we‐‐

236
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,247
'Alright, gentlemen.'

237
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:43,183
I think it best to adjourn

238
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:45,886
and convene the Resident
Review Committee at 12:30

239
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,087
'to discuss the situation.'

240
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,689
I agree. Dr. Morgenstern?

241
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:50,323
Um, yes.

242
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,258
I‐I think that
would be for the best.

243
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:56,630
Hey, what do you have here?

244
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:58,298
28‐year‐old woman,
18 weeks pregnant

245
00:09:58,331 --> 00:09:59,833
found unconscious
at the scene.

246
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:01,735
GCS 11,
multiple lacs, vitals stable.

247
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,169
Let's go.

248
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:05,205
Chicago Reproductive
Center was, was bombed.

249
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:06,807
The abortion
clinic on Riverside?

250
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,209
Oh, they also do prenatal
care and family planning.

251
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:11,177
They're still extricating
people from the rubble.

252
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:12,879
Blowing up
clinics. Bastards!

253
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:13,980
‐ How many have we got?
‐ No idea.

254
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:15,982
It's complete chaos down there.

255
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:17,884
Got a 17‐year‐old,
second trimester.

256
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:19,219
Complains of chest
and abdominal pain

257
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:20,253
shortness of breath.

258
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,222
BP's real low 80/50

259
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:24,124
pulse 120, resps 24.

260
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:25,759
You're going to be okay,
sweetie. You're at a hospital.

261
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:26,927
They're gonna
take care of you, Zoe.

262
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,128
‐ Donny?
‐ No, I'm right here.

263
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:29,395
‐ What's her name?
‐ Zoe Kearney.

264
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:30,430
A wall fell on her.

265
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,698
How far along is she?

266
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:32,733
Six months, give or take.

267
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:34,134
Clear trauma one!

268
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:35,869
No, we cannot
release patient information

269
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:37,370
over the phone.

270
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:40,741
The hospital has no
official comment at this time.

271
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:42,342
Dr. Weaver, it's the
Trib on line three.

272
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,410
They want to know if any
abortion docs were killed.

273
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:46,079
They're called
"gynecologists," Jerry

274
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:47,147
we don't have any information.

275
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,882
A van load of protesters

276
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:50,350
with minor injuries
just came in.

277
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:51,384
Triage them,
leave them in chairs.

278
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,119
We're swamped with criticals.

279
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,955
Nurse, please, there's
something wrong with my ears.

280
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,322
They're ringing and
there's no one helping me.

281
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:57,390
We're really
busy but someone will

282
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,092
get to you as soon as they can.

283
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,727
No, please! I've been in
a bombing for God's sake!

284
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:02,729
I know. We'll get you
a room as soon as we can.

285
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,300
Hey, you should have
somebody look at that.

286
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,369
‐ What?
‐ 'Your head.'

287
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:11,772
‐ 32 French.
‐ Urine dip's negative.

288
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:14,975
‐ Blood gas?
‐ PO2 89, PCO2 25.

289
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,377
Ph 7.29 on ten liters.

290
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,712
Oral alignment okay.

291
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:20,246
Crit's down to 27.

292
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,817
Fetal heart rate 140, no
contractions. Mom's 110/60.

293
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,186
‐ Where's my boyfriend?
‐ He's outside.

294
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:28,354
‐ Is he okay?
‐ He's fine. You just relax.

295
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:29,389
Do you still want the blood?

296
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:30,891
Hang a unit of packed red cells.

297
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:32,325
Alright, let's get her to CT.

298
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,160
Come on,
let's go. Got it?

299
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:35,261
'Yeah.'

300
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,730
Send her blood to radiology.

301
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:37,764
Where is
she going? What's goin' on?

302
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:38,799
Taking her up to CT.

303
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:39,833
Alright, what's on the scope?

304
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,101
Sinus tach at 120.

305
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:42,435
Let OB
know where we're going.

306
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:44,905
I'm right here,
Zoe. I'm right behind you, okay?

307
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:47,007
Was she in for an
abortion or prenatal care?

308
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,042
Um, she's
18‐19 weeks.

309
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,777
Kind of late
for an ab, don't you think?

310
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:52,913
We've got
fetal heart tones 145.

311
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:54,147
Okay, CBC.

312
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,381
'Type and
cross for four units'

313
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:56,517
and cath a urine.

314
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,052
Pulse Ox 98, BP 90/70.

315
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:00,253
Good cap refill.

316
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:01,955
Also get a chest.

317
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:03,223
Uh, shield her abdomen and let's

318
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:04,891
'prep her for a pelvic.'

319
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:06,092
I've got her clinic chart.

320
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:08,361
Brianna Thomas,
18‐week pregnant nullip.

321
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,430
In for an elective
suction extraction.

322
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:11,765
An abortion?

323
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:14,300
Yeah, looks
like they didn't finish.

324
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:16,537
BP's dropped,
80/50. Pulse 110.

325
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,072
She's hemorrhaging.
We need to complete the ab.

326
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:21,274
'Grab a
gyn tray. Grab a tray.'

327
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:22,509
We need to evacuate

328
00:12:22,543 --> 00:12:24,077
the uterus.

329
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,379
Now, doctor.

330
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,215
I can't.

331
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,885
Speculum. Betadine!

332
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,220
Set suction on high
and get me a size..

333
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,255
'...a size‐14 cannula.'

334
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:36,322
Let's go!

335
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:38,024
Second liter's in.

336
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:40,226
'Hang a
third and repeat a crit.'

337
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:47,333
Hey Anna, can I,
uh, speak to you for a moment?

338
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:49,503
Sure.

339
00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:51,505
Alright Kerry,
you want some coffee?

340
00:12:51,538 --> 00:12:52,873
'No, thanks.'

341
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:59,412
So what happened
in that trauma today?

342
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,515
I'm sorry. I froze.

343
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:02,583
Can't happen.

344
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:04,317
I couldn't
complete the abortion.

345
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,986
‐ Why not?
‐ I don't know.

346
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:09,122
The fetus was
so far...along and..

347
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:10,423
Well, what
about Brianna Thomas?

348
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,092
She was your patient
and she was hemorrhaging.

349
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,460
I don't know.
I didn't ex..

350
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,129
The baby had
a chance, you know?

351
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,398
Look, there are plenty
of patients and procedures

352
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:20,133
that we
might find distasteful.

353
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,468
Distasteful?
Come on, Kerry.

354
00:13:22,503 --> 00:13:23,504
I'm not squeamish.

355
00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:25,005
It just felt wrong.

356
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:26,940
We can't allow
our feelings to dictate

357
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,341
the standard
of care that we give people.

358
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:29,375
And I don't.

359
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:30,544
But you did, because of your

360
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:31,845
moral objection to abortion.

361
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:33,547
I don't have a moral objection.

362
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,049
Well, something
happened in there today.

363
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:40,987
I'm his son, Burke.
He lives with me and my family.

364
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:42,589
How long has he
been wetting the bed?

365
00:13:42,623 --> 00:13:44,157
I don't know. Maybe two days.

366
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,626
Smelled pretty bad.

367
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,027
Oh, he's
had urine infections before.

368
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,328
Right.

369
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:50,396
Temp's 102 and
he looks dehydrated.

370
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,533
We tried to get him
to eat or drink something

371
00:13:52,566 --> 00:13:54,000
but he won't.

372
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:55,536
Alright, let's start
a line of normal saline.

373
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:57,337
Give him 500cc bolus

374
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:00,541
CBC, chem 20, blood cultures
times two. Urine C and S.

375
00:14:00,574 --> 00:14:02,308
'Got it.'

376
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,410
Uh, I don't think that's
really all necessary, doctor.

377
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:06,112
'Before, they
just gave him antibiotics.'

378
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:07,147
'It cleared it all up.'

379
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,015
We need to do a full evaluation.

380
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:11,552
Look if you're worried about
being sued I'll sign something.

381
00:14:11,585 --> 00:14:13,453
Got nothing
to do with being sued.

382
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:15,922
So you're gonna poke
him and prod and test him

383
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:17,123
and then
thousands of dollars later

384
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:18,391
you'll give him
the antibiotics.

385
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:19,560
And send him
on his way, am I right?

386
00:14:19,593 --> 00:14:20,961
Why don't you
go back and have a seat

387
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:22,462
while we work on your dad?

388
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:24,064
Unbe‐friggin'‐lievable.

389
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:25,431
Chuny, you
want grab a blood gasket

390
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:26,967
to show
Mr. Newton here to chairs?

391
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,469
I can show myself.

392
00:14:29,503 --> 00:14:31,337
He's a charmer.

393
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:34,474
When's the last time
anyone bathed this guy?

394
00:14:34,508 --> 00:14:36,242
From the looks of these bedsores

395
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:39,012
'about the
same time they turned him.'

396
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,314
So much for honor thy father.

397
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:43,383
'No, I don't understand
your argument, David.'

398
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,151
'The decision
has been made.'

399
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:47,654
Dr. Benton allowed his emotions
to get a little out of hand.

400
00:14:47,688 --> 00:14:49,322
Other than that,
he's a good resident.

401
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:51,024
Who committed
battery on his attending.

402
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,693
It is a shame.
Peter's a good surgeon

403
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,427
But you can't let
something like this stand.

404
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,662
'Like you said, Dr. Weaver'

405
00:14:55,696 --> 00:14:57,397
the decision
has already been made.

406
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,365
Unless you have
a problem with it, David.

407
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:03,236
No.

408
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:04,270
'Deborah, would
you ask Dr. Benton'

409
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:06,139
to come in, please?

410
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:22,422
'Dr. Benton, we have
reviewed Dr. Swanson's chart'

411
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,024
'and the autopsy.'

412
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:25,559
Well, I thought
the autopsy was inconclusive

413
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,661
due to
the state of the body.

414
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:30,731
This committee feels the matter
warrants further investigation.

415
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,132
Well, I don't know
what to say.

416
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:33,534
I mean, everything
I saw and did

417
00:15:33,567 --> 00:15:35,335
is right here
in this report.

418
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:37,237
'Chart aside,
you pushed an attending.'

419
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,304
You're being
taken out of the rotation

420
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:39,973
pending a
formal inquiry.

421
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,278
You're suspending me?

422
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:47,247
'Until Dr. Anspaugh
returns and a full'

423
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,415
investigation can take place.

424
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:53,620
Well, uh...just how long
before I can return to my job?

425
00:15:53,654 --> 00:15:55,756
'We don't know yet.'

426
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:56,990
This is effective...?

427
00:15:57,023 --> 00:15:58,458
'Immediately.'

428
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:12,105
She threw 3 PVC's,
unifocal, no R‐on‐T.

429
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,273
Should I give her lidocaine?

430
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:14,775
'Three? No.
Let's observe.'

431
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,476
'Her chest tube
stopped draining.'

432
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,111
300ccs.

433
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,613
Resps are
a little high at 26.

434
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,281
Zoe, we looked at your CT.

435
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,316
There's no
evidence of organ damage.

436
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:26,019
We still want to admit
you for observation though.

437
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:28,288
‐ For how long?
‐ Oh, we're not quite sure.

438
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,756
'It's kind
of hard to breathe.'

439
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,758
‐ Pulse ox always 94?
‐ No. It's down.

440
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:34,127
I'm fine.
What what about the baby?

441
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,562
You have
fetal heart tones

442
00:16:35,596 --> 00:16:38,231
which means
that the baby is alive.

443
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:40,366
As for kicking,
you're going to have to tell me.

444
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,802
We should
name him Lucky, huh?

445
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,570
Her. I have a feeling.

446
00:16:43,604 --> 00:16:44,805
'You want
to see him or her?'

447
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,206
We're gonna do an ultrasound.

448
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:47,641
Yeah, cool.

449
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:51,311
‐ Zoe, what's wrong?
‐ BP's down to 60 palp.

450
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,345
‐ 'Tell me what's wrong.'
‐ Are you in pain?

451
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:54,047
Pulse ox 90.

452
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,583
She's bradying down. Let's
go, hon. Hang on. Step back.

453
00:16:56,617 --> 00:16:58,151
‐ Pulse is 40.
'‐ She's fine.'

454
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,485
‐ You got to give us room‐‐
‐ She's fine.

455
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,721
‐ To work here, Donny.
‐ Oh, no, oh, no.

456
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:03,056
‐ Oh, no, no.
‐ Pulmonary embolus?

457
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:05,592
Probably. Repeat
a gas, .5 atropine.

458
00:17:05,626 --> 00:17:06,793
Damn.

459
00:17:06,827 --> 00:17:08,394
Alright, start CPR.

460
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:13,199
This one
is almost to the bone.

461
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:15,201
I've seen all I need to see.

462
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:16,603
I'll put this
paper work through.

463
00:17:16,637 --> 00:17:18,238
Hopefully, we'll get Mr. Newton

464
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:20,240
into an extended care
facility by the end of the day.

465
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:21,274
I'd appreciate it.

466
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:22,743
I just need you to sign this

467
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:25,445
and I'll run it down to the
courthouse this afternoon.

468
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:27,581
Thank you for taking
care of this so so quickly.

469
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:29,716
I wish I could say
it was my pleasure.

470
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,218
But you see how people treat
their own parents, you know?

471
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:33,319
Yeah.

472
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:37,724
Hey, hey.
Dr. Carter, what gives?

473
00:17:37,758 --> 00:17:39,392
I've been
sitting here forever.

474
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:42,495
Your father exhibited
textbook signs of neglect.

475
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:43,764
That's crazy.

476
00:17:43,797 --> 00:17:44,831
He hasn't been
bathed for weeks.

477
00:17:44,865 --> 00:17:46,199
He's covered in feces.

478
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,735
He's got
bedsores to the bone.

479
00:17:48,769 --> 00:17:50,136
I've recommended
that he be placed

480
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,471
in an adult care facility.

481
00:17:51,505 --> 00:17:52,839
Oh, you don't have any say here.

482
00:17:52,873 --> 00:17:54,508
‐ I have power of attorney.
‐ Not anymore.

483
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,677
The hospital has claimed
temporary guardianship.

484
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,244
Really? Who's
going to pay for that?

485
00:17:58,278 --> 00:17:59,479
I'm in charge
of the Medicare.

486
00:17:59,513 --> 00:18:00,881
His Medicare
payments will be transferred

487
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:02,516
to the facility
he's placed in.

488
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,556
Expect to hear
from my lawyer.

489
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,725
Look forward to it.

490
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,360
Feels like
there's something in there.

491
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:15,662
With all that
glass flying around

492
00:18:15,696 --> 00:18:16,863
after the explosion

493
00:18:16,897 --> 00:18:19,132
I didn't want
to take a chance.

494
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:20,534
No. You did the right thing.

495
00:18:21,868 --> 00:18:23,436
It's so sad.

496
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:25,438
These extremists..

497
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:28,742
...blowing up
buildings with people inside.

498
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:29,910
Yeah, it's pretty stupid

499
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:31,912
if the idea's
to save lives, huh?

500
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:34,214
Exactly.

501
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:37,483
I marched
with Dr. King in the '60s.

502
00:18:37,518 --> 00:18:40,153
I thought the world would
learn something from him.

503
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:42,288
Yeah.

504
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:45,892
Would you, uh, put your
chin up here for me, please?

505
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:52,265
Must be
hard on you as a doctor

506
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:53,834
and, of course,
a young woman

507
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:56,336
to know that for
every life you save

508
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:59,573
they're taking one
away in that clinic.

509
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:03,209
I, uh, I don't think
about it like that.

510
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:05,546
I don't think
a lot of people do.

511
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:08,481
It's like
that old poem about the Nazis.

512
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:11,718
You know, first,
they came for the Jews

513
00:19:11,752 --> 00:19:12,919
then for whoever

514
00:19:12,953 --> 00:19:14,621
and when
they came to take me‐‐

515
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:16,923
Doctors who
perform abortions aren't Nazis.

516
00:19:16,957 --> 00:19:18,725
Of course not.

517
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:21,828
But if you sit around while
they're taking the children

518
00:19:21,862 --> 00:19:23,730
then who's next?

519
00:19:25,866 --> 00:19:28,334
Alright, I see
something in there.

520
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:31,271
Oh, I knew I
wasn't crazy.

521
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:32,673
Okay, hold real still for me.

522
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:37,844
‐ I got it.
‐ Oh.

523
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,815
Okay. You're all set.

524
00:19:43,984 --> 00:19:46,920
If you have any discomfort,
you can take some ibuprofen.

525
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:48,922
Use these
drops four times a day

526
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:51,558
and, uh, come back
tomorrow for a recheck.

527
00:19:51,592 --> 00:19:52,926
‐ Thank you.
‐ Mm.

528
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,461
Um, this is some
information on our group.

529
00:19:55,495 --> 00:19:58,364
We hold rescue strategy
meetings every Wednesday.

530
00:19:58,398 --> 00:20:00,466
‐ The address is on the back.
‐ No, thanks.

531
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,435
Okay.

532
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:03,637
Oh, can't forget this.

533
00:20:11,812 --> 00:20:13,880
Hey, Miss Martinez.

534
00:20:13,914 --> 00:20:16,316
You forgot this.

535
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:17,518
I thought we felt the same.

536
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:18,719
No, we don't.

537
00:20:18,752 --> 00:20:20,353
You're not
a peaceful protester.

538
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:21,822
That sign is a call to arms.

539
00:20:21,855 --> 00:20:23,657
The bomber probably
saw it or one just like it.

540
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,726
It's reality, doctor.

541
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:27,561
If it upsets you,
then it's done its job.

542
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:30,396
The only job it's done
is to encourage violence

543
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,898
and yes, that upsets me.

544
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:34,735
She was okay before this.

545
00:20:34,768 --> 00:20:37,037
She was, uh, she was
fine, she was talking.

546
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,705
'She had
a clot in her lung.'

547
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:41,374
'It deprived
her brain of oxygen.'

548
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:42,576
'There's no
way anyone could have'

549
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:43,610
'predicted it'd
would happen.'

550
00:20:43,644 --> 00:20:44,845
'Are you sure?'

551
00:20:44,878 --> 00:20:46,780
We're going to do
an EEG. and a brain scan

552
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:49,616
to confirm it.

553
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:53,019
Um, so, she's in a coma?

554
00:20:53,053 --> 00:20:54,588
It's like
a coma, yeah.

555
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:56,990
Yes.

556
00:20:57,023 --> 00:20:59,359
Uh, um...
people come out of comas.

557
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:00,393
Not when the brain

558
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,362
'has been deprived of oxygen'

559
00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:04,297
'as long as Zoe's has, no.'

560
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:09,435
What about the baby?

561
00:21:12,973 --> 00:21:14,608
Baby appears to be fine.

562
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,979
Can you save her?

563
00:21:19,012 --> 00:21:20,914
Probably.
I think so, yeah.

564
00:21:22,516 --> 00:21:25,351
And it's a girl?

565
00:21:25,385 --> 00:21:26,452
Yes.

566
00:21:32,025 --> 00:21:33,459
You hear that, Zoe?

567
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:38,832
You were right.

568
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:40,366
It's a girl.

569
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:44,938
Wanted to talk
to you before I left.

570
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:48,108
‐ Aren't you on till 7:00?
‐ No. I've been suspended.

571
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:49,643
You're not serious?

572
00:21:49,676 --> 00:21:51,578
Yeah, well, I
wish I wasn't, you know‐‐

573
00:21:51,612 --> 00:21:52,713
Need help here now!

574
00:21:52,746 --> 00:21:54,480
Look, I'll call you later, okay?

575
00:21:54,515 --> 00:21:55,949
‐ What have we got?
‐ She's my trainee.

576
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:57,851
She got crushed
underneath some unstable debris

577
00:21:57,884 --> 00:21:59,520
during an extrication
at the reproductive center.

578
00:21:59,553 --> 00:22:01,087
Thought we took care
of the clinic traumas.

579
00:22:01,121 --> 00:22:02,623
People were trapped
underneath the rubble.

580
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:04,691
BP's 60 palp,
pulse 150 and thready.

581
00:22:04,725 --> 00:22:07,360
IV's infiltrated.
Poor cap refill.

582
00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:08,662
Dr. Corday.

583
00:22:08,695 --> 00:22:10,864
Oh my God, Allison.
Clear trauma one!

584
00:22:10,897 --> 00:22:12,633
‐ EBL on scene?
‐ Half a liter.

585
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,868
I hope you didn't mess up
my beautiful fibular graft.

586
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:19,940
48‐year‐old custodian

587
00:22:19,973 --> 00:22:21,742
multiple deep lacs to
the left chest and back.

588
00:22:21,775 --> 00:22:23,043
'Lost a liter at the scene.'

589
00:22:23,076 --> 00:22:24,110
BP's 70/30.

590
00:22:24,144 --> 00:22:25,679
Pulse thready at 144.

591
00:22:25,712 --> 00:22:27,113
Sir, are you with us?

592
00:22:27,147 --> 00:22:28,615
‐ Peter.
‐ I'm on my way home.

593
00:22:28,649 --> 00:22:29,983
Very funny. Let's go.

594
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:31,785
Mark, I'm not joking.
I've been suspended.

595
00:22:31,818 --> 00:22:32,919
'Not by me you haven't.'

596
00:22:32,953 --> 00:22:34,087
Come on. I need you.

597
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:39,392
Alright, let's
get six units O‐neg.

598
00:22:39,425 --> 00:22:41,394
Call the trauma team.
Tell them we're on our way.

599
00:22:44,698 --> 00:22:46,132
Alright, let's roll him.

600
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:47,868
Open pneumothorax.
Let's tube him.

601
00:22:47,901 --> 00:22:50,036
Ah, damn it! We got a pumper!

602
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,638
‐ No pulse!
‐ Alright.

603
00:22:51,672 --> 00:22:53,073
‐ Start CPR.
‐ We need to crack him.

604
00:22:53,106 --> 00:22:54,608
Thoracotomy tray. Let's move.

605
00:22:54,641 --> 00:22:56,577
‐ Cricoid pressure.
‐ Here's your 10 blade.

606
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:58,779
7.5 ET Tube. Let's go.

607
00:23:00,947 --> 00:23:02,716
‐ 'Suction.'
‐ Alright, there it is.

608
00:23:02,749 --> 00:23:05,652
Traumatic aortic
dissection and rupture.

609
00:23:05,686 --> 00:23:07,053
I'm in. Hyperventilate him.

610
00:23:07,087 --> 00:23:08,689
Could you get the Statinsky in?

611
00:23:08,722 --> 00:23:11,157
No. I'm sticking
my finger in.

612
00:23:11,191 --> 00:23:12,959
Don't let go, Peter,
you stopped the bleeding.

613
00:23:12,993 --> 00:23:15,629
Alright. I'm
holding CPR. Carotid pulse?

614
00:23:15,662 --> 00:23:17,564
Faint.

615
00:23:17,598 --> 00:23:19,900
Hey, pump in more O‐neg.
Let's get him upstairs.

616
00:23:19,933 --> 00:23:22,736
Malik, you're gonna stay
with us, keep bagging him.

617
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:27,173
Let's go,
people! Go, go, go!

618
00:23:27,207 --> 00:23:28,609
Alert the bypass team.

619
00:23:28,642 --> 00:23:29,910
You set
the pace, Peter.

620
00:23:29,943 --> 00:23:31,845
‐ We're following you.
‐ Watch that IV!

621
00:23:31,878 --> 00:23:33,780
Call the OR,
and tell them we're coming up!

622
00:23:33,814 --> 00:23:35,616
Dr. Benton,
I thought you understood..

623
00:23:35,649 --> 00:23:38,084
Not now. He's tamponading
an aortic tear with his finger.

624
00:23:38,118 --> 00:23:39,219
Come on, people,
don't jostle the gurney.

625
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:40,721
Alright, well, carry on.

626
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:43,590
Alright, hit five.

627
00:23:43,624 --> 00:23:45,491
We need four units
O‐neg on the infuser.

628
00:23:45,526 --> 00:23:46,560
What's up, Lizzie?

629
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:47,594
Decreased
breath sounds

630
00:23:47,628 --> 00:23:49,029
hyper‐resonant, hemopneumo.

631
00:23:49,062 --> 00:23:51,064
I've got the chest tube.

632
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:52,633
Can we
give her morphine?

633
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:55,569
‐ Check the BP first.
‐ It hurts.

634
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:57,604
You've got multiple
rib fractures. Try not to talk.

635
00:23:57,638 --> 00:23:59,005
Now, where have
I heard that before?

636
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,942
Thoraseal's filling.

637
00:24:01,975 --> 00:24:03,510
We need
an abdominal CT.

638
00:24:03,544 --> 00:24:05,245
She's unstable
do a peritoneal lavage.

639
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:07,047
Type and cross
for eight and spin a crit.

640
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,182
Pulse ox is down, 90.
Here's the O‐neg.

641
00:24:10,517 --> 00:24:11,752
You want me to do it?

642
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:12,786
No.

643
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:14,521
You do it.

644
00:24:14,555 --> 00:24:15,689
Okay.

645
00:24:25,932 --> 00:24:29,169
‐ Hey.
‐ Uh, hi.

646
00:24:29,202 --> 00:24:31,104
I, uh,
I'm sorry to wake you up.

647
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:33,106
I was just resting my eyes.

648
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:35,509
I brought you some
orange juice and a sandwich.

649
00:24:35,542 --> 00:24:37,611
I figured
you might be hungry.

650
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:39,913
Thanks.

651
00:24:39,946 --> 00:24:41,515
You feeling okay?

652
00:24:41,548 --> 00:24:43,617
Fine, considering.

653
00:24:44,885 --> 00:24:46,687
‐ Were you my doctor?
‐ Oh, no.

654
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,955
That was, uh...Dr. Weaver.

655
00:24:48,989 --> 00:24:52,225
Two docs
no waiting, huh?

656
00:24:52,258 --> 00:24:53,560
My boyfriend
brought by my clothes

657
00:24:53,594 --> 00:24:55,095
so I'll let you
have your bed back.

658
00:24:55,128 --> 00:24:56,963
Are you sure you're
feeling well enough to go home?

659
00:24:56,997 --> 00:24:58,164
Yeah, like I said, I'm fine.

660
00:24:58,198 --> 00:25:00,300
I'd I'd just rather be at home.

661
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:01,868
So if you don't
mind giving me some privacy

662
00:25:01,902 --> 00:25:03,103
I'm going to get changed.

663
00:25:03,136 --> 00:25:06,840
Okay. Sure.

664
00:25:06,873 --> 00:25:09,543
Sorry.

665
00:25:09,576 --> 00:25:11,277
Doctor?

666
00:25:11,311 --> 00:25:13,580
Doctor?

667
00:25:14,648 --> 00:25:15,849
Hi, Mr. Newton.

668
00:25:15,882 --> 00:25:17,250
How are you feeling?

669
00:25:17,283 --> 00:25:18,985
I'm tired.

670
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:22,823
That's from the dehydration,
malnutrition mostly.

671
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:25,025
Where‐where's..

672
00:25:25,058 --> 00:25:26,259
...where's Burke?

673
00:25:26,292 --> 00:25:28,161
He left.

674
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:30,330
He deals with the..

675
00:25:30,363 --> 00:25:31,998
...the paperwork.

676
00:25:32,032 --> 00:25:35,636
Your son is no longer
your guardian, Mr. Newton.

677
00:25:35,669 --> 00:25:38,171
For the time being...I am.

678
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:41,341
But why? What?

679
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:43,677
'The elder abuse unit
is filing paperwork'

680
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:44,878
'to put you into a home.'

681
00:25:46,847 --> 00:25:50,617
But...I have a home.

682
00:25:50,651 --> 00:25:53,654
You have some very serious
medical problems resulting

683
00:25:53,687 --> 00:25:56,690
from what we believe has
been some very serious neglect.

684
00:25:56,723 --> 00:25:59,860
I'm 86 years old.

685
00:26:00,961 --> 00:26:04,865
I've slept in the same bed..

686
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:06,800
...for 70 years.

687
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:09,903
I'm...just trying to help you.

688
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:17,611
I want to die in my own bed.

689
00:26:21,114 --> 00:26:22,248
You're not
sterile. Go scrub.

690
00:26:22,282 --> 00:26:23,850
Not letting go.

691
00:26:23,884 --> 00:26:26,119
Get ten
units packed cells. Let's move.

692
00:26:26,152 --> 00:26:27,654
Okay, people,
on my count.

693
00:26:27,688 --> 00:26:30,023
One, two, three.

694
00:26:30,056 --> 00:26:31,224
Alright, let's
get this gurney out.

695
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:32,759
Alright, Mark,
help me roll him.

696
00:26:32,793 --> 00:26:35,696
Alright.

697
00:26:35,729 --> 00:26:36,830
Open an instrument tray.

698
00:26:36,863 --> 00:26:37,964
No one's
gloved and gowned.

699
00:26:37,998 --> 00:26:39,265
Come on. Just do it.

700
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:41,301
Get gloves, gowns,
masks and caps in here, now.

701
00:26:41,334 --> 00:26:43,269
Ah. Okay, ten blade.

702
00:26:43,303 --> 00:26:44,871
‐ Get him a mask.
‐ Let's move.

703
00:26:44,905 --> 00:26:46,940
Tonsil sucker.

704
00:26:46,973 --> 00:26:50,410
Alright, I'm going
to mobilize the aorta. Metz.

705
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:52,345
Let's move.
Let's move. Come on.

706
00:26:52,378 --> 00:26:53,914
What's going on?

707
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:55,381
Peter's got his hand
on this man's aorta.

708
00:26:55,415 --> 00:26:57,183
Potts clamp.

709
00:26:57,217 --> 00:27:00,386
I'm going to
do a revised clamp and run.

710
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,657
Got a second Potts.

711
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:06,426
Stand by. Got it.

712
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:09,262
Okay, you
can take your finger out now.

713
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:10,797
Set up the bovie.

714
00:27:10,831 --> 00:27:12,232
Pulse is stronger.

715
00:27:12,265 --> 00:27:14,267
Okay, let's go for a BP.

716
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,770
3‐0 prolene on a
vascular needle, here we go.

717
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:18,271
Suction, please.
Somebody hoover that.

718
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:20,140
Systolic's up to 80.

719
00:27:20,173 --> 00:27:21,407
Terrific.

720
00:27:21,441 --> 00:27:24,110
Okay. We can take over now.

721
00:27:24,144 --> 00:27:26,012
Bovie, please.

722
00:27:29,415 --> 00:27:31,417
A 3‐0, please.
Keep them coming.

723
00:27:31,451 --> 00:27:33,453
'Retractor and bovie.'

724
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:35,121
'4 x 4 on
a sponge stick, please.'

725
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,224
'Cut that.'

726
00:27:38,258 --> 00:27:39,826
Good, good, good.

727
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,028
'3‐0. Keep them coming.'

728
00:27:42,062 --> 00:27:44,731
'This is looking
very good, very good.'

729
00:27:50,871 --> 00:27:52,939
Oh, sweet Jesus.

730
00:27:52,973 --> 00:27:54,908
There's got to be
some other kind of test.

731
00:27:54,941 --> 00:27:58,411
‐ My angel. Sweetheart.
‐ What's he doing here?

732
00:27:58,444 --> 00:27:59,946
He was with her
when the clinic was bombed.

733
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,214
I bet he was.

734
00:28:01,247 --> 00:28:02,315
We were getting
a prenatal checkup.

735
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:03,349
You killed my daughter.

736
00:28:03,383 --> 00:28:04,384
I hope you're proud of yourself.

737
00:28:04,417 --> 00:28:05,819
Miles!

738
00:28:05,852 --> 00:28:07,120
If she stayed
with the two of you

739
00:28:07,153 --> 00:28:08,454
she would have killed
herself a long time ago.

740
00:28:08,488 --> 00:28:09,489
Everybody everybody
needs to calm down.

741
00:28:09,523 --> 00:28:11,124
He needs to get the hell

742
00:28:11,157 --> 00:28:13,193
out of my daughter's room,
that's what needs to happen.

743
00:28:13,226 --> 00:28:15,495
I love her.

744
00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:17,263
You guys treated her like crap.

745
00:28:17,297 --> 00:28:18,799
I'm calling an OB Consult.

746
00:28:18,832 --> 00:28:20,466
Why don't you come with me..

747
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,268
...and give
them some time alone?

748
00:28:22,302 --> 00:28:24,370
Alright? Come on.

749
00:28:24,404 --> 00:28:25,906
Here we go. Come on.

750
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,218
'She's been
in asystole for 20 minutes.'

751
00:28:38,251 --> 00:28:39,820
‐ 'Let's call it.'
‐ Another seven of epi.

752
00:28:39,853 --> 00:28:41,254
She's already had ten, Lizzie.

753
00:28:41,287 --> 00:28:43,023
And we got a response,
seven more.

754
00:28:43,056 --> 00:28:44,324
Two agonal beats.
It's not a response.

755
00:28:44,357 --> 00:28:45,391
Let's start an epinephrine drip.

756
00:28:45,425 --> 00:28:46,893
Why don't we also give her

757
00:28:46,927 --> 00:28:48,394
a heart transplant
while we're at it?

758
00:28:48,428 --> 00:28:49,796
Why don't you just
stop being such a prick?

759
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,464
Get me two units
of packed cells!

760
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:55,101
Thank you.
Dr. Weaver?

761
00:28:55,135 --> 00:28:57,003
Yes.

762
00:28:57,037 --> 00:28:58,805
I just wanted to say
thanks for all you've done

763
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:01,875
for me today,
the abortion and all.

764
00:29:01,908 --> 00:29:03,544
Right. You're welcome.

765
00:29:03,577 --> 00:29:06,312
It's got to be the most
memorable one I ever got.

766
00:29:06,346 --> 00:29:07,981
You've had others?

767
00:29:08,014 --> 00:29:09,916
A few.

768
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,918
I really thought Earl
would want this baby.

769
00:29:11,952 --> 00:29:13,386
Like it would help
him get serious about us

770
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:15,388
but when he found out
he hit the roof.

771
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:16,557
You know
our clinic can advise you

772
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,792
on methods of family planning.

773
00:29:18,825 --> 00:29:21,027
Earl doesn't like that stuff,
and those pills make me fat.

774
00:29:21,061 --> 00:29:22,529
Still, there are
preferable forms

775
00:29:22,563 --> 00:29:24,565
of birth control than abortion.

776
00:29:24,598 --> 00:29:26,432
Why are you being
such a bitch?

777
00:29:26,466 --> 00:29:28,401
Because you're
being irresponsible.

778
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:31,071
More likely it's 'cause
you don't get any yourself.

779
00:29:33,239 --> 00:29:35,241
'And it's a very
difficult decision.'

780
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:37,844
'Neither of which
will bring Zoe back.'

781
00:29:37,878 --> 00:29:41,081
'That's true, but if the
decision is to keep the baby'

782
00:29:41,114 --> 00:29:42,883
'then you really
have two options.'

783
00:29:42,916 --> 00:29:45,451
'The first is that we
perform an emergency C‐section.'

784
00:29:45,485 --> 00:29:47,320
'We deliver
a very premature baby'

785
00:29:47,353 --> 00:29:51,191
and then we take Zoe
off the respirator.

786
00:29:51,224 --> 00:29:52,358
That means the baby
would have to go

787
00:29:52,392 --> 00:29:54,260
in an incubator, right?

788
00:29:54,294 --> 00:29:55,896
That's right.

789
00:29:55,929 --> 00:29:58,498
Probably months
of intensive care.

790
00:29:58,532 --> 00:30:00,066
What's the
other option?

791
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,167
The other
option is that we

792
00:30:01,201 --> 00:30:02,936
keep Zoe on life support

793
00:30:02,969 --> 00:30:05,405
until we can deliver
the baby full term.

794
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,909
And what
do you recommend?

795
00:30:08,942 --> 00:30:11,277
I'd recommend
the later delivery.

796
00:30:11,311 --> 00:30:13,079
So..

797
00:30:13,113 --> 00:30:15,381
you're suggesting
that our daughter..

798
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:19,385
...be made into
a human incubator

799
00:30:19,419 --> 00:30:22,589
even though
she has no chance of recovery.

800
00:30:22,623 --> 00:30:24,024
It's the baby's best chance.

801
00:30:24,057 --> 00:30:26,492
I don't want to
see Zoe left lying there

802
00:30:26,527 --> 00:30:30,063
like some...kind of vessel.

803
00:30:30,096 --> 00:30:31,264
She wanted this baby

804
00:30:31,297 --> 00:30:33,033
more than
anything in the world.

805
00:30:33,066 --> 00:30:35,569
You have no say
in this matter.

806
00:30:35,602 --> 00:30:37,070
I'm the baby's father.

807
00:30:37,103 --> 00:30:39,072
I'm Zoe's father.

808
00:30:39,105 --> 00:30:40,273
And you and she are minors.

809
00:30:40,306 --> 00:30:42,643
The decision..

810
00:30:42,676 --> 00:30:44,978
..is mine and her mother's.

811
00:30:45,011 --> 00:30:46,613
They can't
do this, can they?

812
00:30:51,518 --> 00:30:53,887
I'm sorry it took us
so long to get to you.

813
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,388
Oh, I understand.

814
00:30:55,421 --> 00:30:56,923
I was just
really freaked out.

815
00:30:56,957 --> 00:30:58,158
It's not every day
the waiting room

816
00:30:58,191 --> 00:30:59,492
you're sitting
in explodes.

817
00:30:59,526 --> 00:31:01,461
Yeah, understandable.

818
00:31:01,494 --> 00:31:02,529
Okay, you're all set.

819
00:31:02,563 --> 00:31:04,197
Just keep it elevated and dry

820
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,999
and come back in two
days for a recheck, okay?

821
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:07,300
Okay, yeah.

822
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:09,670
Uh, you left
your insurance form blank.

823
00:31:09,703 --> 00:31:12,205
Yeah, I left
my card at home.

824
00:31:12,238 --> 00:31:13,373
Is there someone you
can call to come and get it?

825
00:31:13,406 --> 00:31:15,141
Uh, no, I'll pay cash.

826
00:31:15,175 --> 00:31:16,309
Oh, that's not necessary.

827
00:31:16,342 --> 00:31:17,578
Your insurance
will cover this.

828
00:31:17,611 --> 00:31:19,445
No, I know, I know.
I just, I, um

829
00:31:19,479 --> 00:31:22,649
I don't want my husband to
know that I‐I was at the clinic.

830
00:31:22,683 --> 00:31:24,618
Oh.

831
00:31:24,651 --> 00:31:26,452
Yeah, I thought
I was too old

832
00:31:26,486 --> 00:31:28,121
for this kind of
thing to happen.

833
00:31:28,154 --> 00:31:30,657
Then I started to puke
up corn flakes every morning

834
00:31:30,691 --> 00:31:33,126
and now I have to
find a new clinic

835
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:35,662
preferably one
that is not ticking.

836
00:31:35,696 --> 00:31:37,598
So you haven't had
the abortion yet.

837
00:31:37,631 --> 00:31:38,632
No.

838
00:31:38,665 --> 00:31:40,433
And if my husband finds out

839
00:31:40,466 --> 00:31:42,402
he just
won't have the heart.

840
00:31:42,435 --> 00:31:44,404
Our youngest
daughter's in college.

841
00:31:44,437 --> 00:31:46,206
He put all four
kids through college.

842
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:48,942
He worked five years
past his retirement

843
00:31:48,975 --> 00:31:52,178
to be able to
pay for it, and..

844
00:31:52,212 --> 00:31:54,515
I've never kept anything
from him before but..

845
00:31:54,548 --> 00:31:56,583
What if you told him
what you just told me?

846
00:31:56,617 --> 00:32:00,621
I can't. I'd love to,
but...I can't.

847
00:32:02,756 --> 00:32:05,025
‐ Anyway, what do I owe you?
‐ Don't worry about it.

848
00:32:05,058 --> 00:32:06,993
Just bring me
your card tomorrow morning.

849
00:32:07,027 --> 00:32:10,230
I could leave a license
or something as collateral.

850
00:32:10,263 --> 00:32:11,732
It's alright.
I trust you.

851
00:32:11,765 --> 00:32:12,966
Thanks.

852
00:32:12,999 --> 00:32:14,200
Oh, and if..

853
00:32:14,234 --> 00:32:16,402
...uh, anybody asks..

854
00:32:16,436 --> 00:32:18,539
...you can get a laceration
like that from a dog bite.

855
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,311
Hey, Shirley,
have you seen Dr. Corday?

856
00:32:25,345 --> 00:32:26,479
She's still in OR Three

857
00:32:26,513 --> 00:32:27,714
with that
paramedic, Beaumont.

858
00:32:27,748 --> 00:32:30,116
Okay, thanks.

859
00:32:35,488 --> 00:32:38,759
Hey. She made it, huh?

860
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:40,326
Mm‐hmm.

861
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,129
What's wrong? You okay?

862
00:32:43,163 --> 00:32:44,565
Yeah.

863
00:32:44,598 --> 00:32:48,602
It was,
uh...it was scary.

864
00:32:48,635 --> 00:32:50,370
You can
put them back together

865
00:32:50,403 --> 00:32:53,540
but, uh, you can't
keep them that way.

866
00:33:04,417 --> 00:33:06,553
'Scotty always had such..'

867
00:33:06,587 --> 00:33:09,322
'...great school spirit.'

868
00:33:09,355 --> 00:33:13,026
I think I can speak
for the whole team when I say

869
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:15,128
we're really
going to miss him.

870
00:33:23,069 --> 00:33:25,539
I was going to sing a hymn

871
00:33:25,572 --> 00:33:29,242
but as I'm sitting
here thinking of Scott..

872
00:33:29,275 --> 00:33:31,812
...here's a song that he loved..

873
00:33:31,845 --> 00:33:34,147
..and it'll
always remind me of him.

874

Hey, Zadro. Fancy seeing
you on the surgical floor.

881
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:10,784
'Cause I just wanted to tell you

882
00:34:10,817 --> 00:34:13,119
we all appreciate what
you did for Allison.

883
00:34:13,153 --> 00:34:14,621
Yeah, well, she's a fighter.

884
00:34:14,655 --> 00:34:16,823
With a damn good
guardian angel.

885
00:34:18,692 --> 00:34:20,460
Um, Lizzie, I, uh..

886
00:34:20,493 --> 00:34:22,262
I just
wanted to apologize

887
00:34:22,295 --> 00:34:25,098
for, uh, the way I spoke
during the Beaumont surgery.

888
00:34:25,131 --> 00:34:26,533
I know that she
means a lot to you

889
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:29,335
and I, uh, just hope
you'll forgive me.

890
00:34:29,369 --> 00:34:30,504
Of course.

891
00:34:30,537 --> 00:34:32,272
It's been a
crazy day for all of us.

892
00:34:32,305 --> 00:34:35,475
Um, I, uh, I get
off in about an hour.

893
00:34:35,509 --> 00:34:38,545
You want to, uh, get
a drink, uh, decompress?

894
00:34:38,579 --> 00:34:40,380
Look, I'm knackered.

895
00:34:40,413 --> 00:34:42,248
Uh, any other day.

896
00:34:42,282 --> 00:34:44,551
‐ Okay?
‐ Look, I understand. Look, um..

897
00:34:44,585 --> 00:34:46,553
...If you change your
mind, you have my home number.

898
00:34:46,587 --> 00:34:48,088
Yes, I do.

899
00:34:52,826 --> 00:34:55,629
David?

900
00:34:55,662 --> 00:34:57,864
I forgot what
this place was all about.

901
00:34:57,898 --> 00:35:01,367
The teamwork,
the well‐oiled machine.

902
00:35:01,401 --> 00:35:02,636
What?

903
00:35:04,771 --> 00:35:10,176
I've let the situation
get...completely out of hand.

904
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:12,212
I told myself
the varices were too friable

905
00:35:12,245 --> 00:35:16,216
that my field was obscured,
that I‐I was protecting

906
00:35:16,249 --> 00:35:18,284
Dr. Swanson's dignity.

907
00:35:18,318 --> 00:35:20,353
I wasn't.

908
00:35:20,386 --> 00:35:24,190
I was covering my own ass.

909
00:35:24,224 --> 00:35:27,694
Look, if you make a mistake
that's all that it is.

910
00:35:27,728 --> 00:35:29,362
No.

911
00:35:29,395 --> 00:35:32,332
No. It's more than that.

912
00:35:32,365 --> 00:35:33,634
What are you watching?

913
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:39,272
What am I not watching?
That's the question.

914
00:35:41,975 --> 00:35:44,611
This is the tape of
Swanson's laparoscopy.

915
00:35:44,645 --> 00:35:46,346
Where did you get it?

916
00:35:46,379 --> 00:35:50,283
I...I took it...
right after the surgery.

917
00:35:50,316 --> 00:35:54,387
I've been too chicken
to look at it.

918
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:58,291
I guess I thought we
could avoid a confrontation.

919
00:35:58,324 --> 00:36:00,861
A resident can take
a note in his file.

920
00:36:00,894 --> 00:36:04,297
Right? Peter's got
so much less to lose.

921
00:36:07,433 --> 00:36:09,469
I could toss this
right now.

922
00:36:09,503 --> 00:36:11,972
No one would
be the wiser.

923
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:13,373
You wouldn't
have called me up here

924
00:36:13,406 --> 00:36:16,476
if that's what you
were going to do.

925
00:36:36,897 --> 00:36:41,434
Jeanie...I wondered
where you'd gotten to.

926
00:36:41,467 --> 00:36:42,603
I'm just
sitting in here.

927
00:36:42,636 --> 00:36:45,539
It's very peaceful.

928
00:36:45,572 --> 00:36:47,841
Yes, it is.

929
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:54,515
When, uh, Scotty was
going through the worst of it

930
00:36:54,548 --> 00:37:00,486
I went into
his room, found his journal.

931
00:37:00,521 --> 00:37:03,957
I know I shouldn't
have looked at it

932
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:07,761
but I wanted
to understand him.

933
00:37:07,794 --> 00:37:11,598
The way you and...
his mother seemed to.

934
00:37:11,632 --> 00:37:13,366
He loved you very much.

935
00:37:17,604 --> 00:37:21,642
He said, "Jeanie just gets it.

936
00:37:21,675 --> 00:37:24,811
"I don't have to
explain anything to her

937
00:37:24,845 --> 00:37:26,780
because she already knows."

938
00:37:28,549 --> 00:37:29,950
That's very sweet.

939
00:37:31,618 --> 00:37:32,953
I remember when he told me

940
00:37:32,986 --> 00:37:34,821
about what he wanted
to be when he grew up.

941
00:37:36,623 --> 00:37:39,259
Some kind of rock 'n' roll
star probably.

942
00:37:40,894 --> 00:37:42,929
He wanted to join the army.

943
00:37:46,332 --> 00:37:47,801
He did?

944
00:37:47,834 --> 00:37:49,002
Mm‐hmm.

945
00:38:01,748 --> 00:38:02,783
I paged OB.

946
00:38:02,816 --> 00:38:03,817
Going to
send somebody down here

947
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:05,485
to discuss your options.

948
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:07,888
We've decided
to keep the baby

949
00:38:07,921 --> 00:38:11,391
and wait until
it's closer to term.

950
00:38:11,424 --> 00:38:13,459
Good. I'm glad.
Donny will be glad, too.

951
00:38:13,493 --> 00:38:15,361
This is no longer any
of Donny's business.

952
00:38:18,431 --> 00:38:19,933
Maybe if you give it
a little more time.

953
00:38:19,966 --> 00:38:22,503
I've contacted
our attorney.

954
00:38:22,536 --> 00:38:25,872
My wife and I are
filing for sole custody.

955
00:38:25,906 --> 00:38:28,709
Is this to teach
Donny a lesson?

956
00:38:28,742 --> 00:38:30,577
Nothing could teach Donny
the lesson he deserves.

957
00:38:30,611 --> 00:38:31,978
I've seen
a lot of parents

958
00:38:32,012 --> 00:38:33,680
twice his age who
weren't responsible enough

959
00:38:33,714 --> 00:38:35,048
to seek prenatal care.

960
00:38:35,081 --> 00:38:37,083
Responsible?

961
00:38:37,117 --> 00:38:39,352
Getting a
16‐year‐old girl pregnant

962
00:38:39,385 --> 00:38:41,087
forcing her to leave
home, drop out of school...

963
00:38:41,121 --> 00:38:42,488
‐ 'Please, Miles.'
‐ No.

964
00:38:42,523 --> 00:38:43,590
The doctor
seems to fancy himself

965
00:38:43,624 --> 00:38:44,691
an expert on our family.

966
00:38:44,725 --> 00:38:47,561
‐ I don't. It's..
‐ Hmpf.

967
00:38:47,594 --> 00:38:50,063
Just what's...
best for the child.

968
00:38:50,096 --> 00:38:51,765
We let Donny
into our lives once

969
00:38:51,798 --> 00:38:53,433
and he took
our daughter away.

970
00:38:53,466 --> 00:38:55,435
He's not going to
take our granddaughter.

971
00:38:58,438 --> 00:38:59,840
I don't want to go.

972
00:38:59,873 --> 00:39:00,974
Everything will
be fine, Mr. Newton

973
00:39:01,007 --> 00:39:02,609
but this really is for the best.

974
00:39:02,643 --> 00:39:03,944
I'm not so sure
this is for the best.

975
00:39:03,977 --> 00:39:05,746
You filed and signed
a legal report.

976
00:39:05,779 --> 00:39:07,514
You can't just
rescind that on a whim.

977
00:39:07,548 --> 00:39:09,382
I want to go home.
I want to go home.

978
00:39:09,415 --> 00:39:10,450
There. If you're not
going to listen

979
00:39:10,483 --> 00:39:11,718
to me at least listen to him.

980
00:39:11,752 --> 00:39:13,520
Someone in an abusive
situation can't always

981
00:39:13,554 --> 00:39:15,421
'determine the
best course of action.'

982
00:39:15,455 --> 00:39:17,023
'You're not talking
about a hypothetical here.'

983
00:39:17,057 --> 00:39:18,825
You're talking about
an adult human being

984
00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:20,426
who's making a
decision to go home.

985
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,728
According to
your own report he was

986
00:39:21,762 --> 00:39:22,929
non compos mentis on admission.

987
00:39:22,963 --> 00:39:24,765
He was severely dehydrated.

988
00:39:24,798 --> 00:39:27,067
Once we ran some fluids in him
he's become perfectly lucid.

989
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,169
Mr. Newton, I know you're scared

990
00:39:29,202 --> 00:39:31,071
'but I'm scared about
what's going to happen to you'

991
00:39:31,104 --> 00:39:32,172
if you're
not taken care of.

992
00:39:32,205 --> 00:39:33,507
I'm fine.

993
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,842
Doctor, Dr. Carter, call Burke

994
00:39:35,876 --> 00:39:37,611
he'll, he'll explain.

995
00:39:37,644 --> 00:39:39,846
Don't force me
to get the police involved

996
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,047
and press formal charges

997
00:39:41,081 --> 00:39:43,517
against your
son and daughter‐in‐law.

998
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:46,987
Can she do this?
Please...don't let her.

999
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:49,790
'Don't let her do that, doctor.
Doctor, don't let her do that.'

1000
00:39:49,823 --> 00:39:51,525
I‐I'm...sorry.

1001
00:39:51,558 --> 00:39:53,594
'I want to go home!'

1002
00:39:53,627 --> 00:39:54,861
Thank you.

1003
00:39:54,895 --> 00:39:56,663
Uh, Kerry?

1004
00:39:56,697 --> 00:39:58,431
Anna.

1005
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,066
What happened
today, it really threw me

1006
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,134
and it's been on my mind.

1007
00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:02,736
I wanted to talk
to you about it.

1008
00:40:02,769 --> 00:40:06,106
Same here. I...I should
have explained myself better

1009
00:40:06,139 --> 00:40:08,041
instead of
flying off the handle.

1010
00:40:08,074 --> 00:40:12,112
‐ No. You were right.
‐ No. Just let me explain.

1011
00:40:12,145 --> 00:40:13,747
I did some overseas work

1012
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:17,117
in Africa, where
abortion is illegal

1013
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:20,554
and I‐I saw
15‐year‐old girls

1014
00:40:20,587 --> 00:40:24,057
in septic shock
from botched procedures

1015
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:26,627
and there was
nothing we could do.

1016
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:27,928
I've made
it a priority

1017
00:40:27,961 --> 00:40:30,997
to be the best doctor
I can be and to support

1018
00:40:31,031 --> 00:40:32,999
all my patients' choices.

1019
00:40:33,033 --> 00:40:35,001
If you would have asked me
when I got up this morning

1020
00:40:35,035 --> 00:40:37,838
I would have...I would
have said the same thing

1021
00:40:37,871 --> 00:40:39,806
but in this case, she
was so far along, and‐‐

1022
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,542
And what if
another Brianna Thomas

1023
00:40:41,575 --> 00:40:42,843
comes through those doors?

1024
00:40:44,978 --> 00:40:46,246
I'd love to be able to tell you

1025
00:40:46,279 --> 00:40:49,716
that if the same case
came in tomorrow

1026
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,084
I'd be able
to do the procedure

1027
00:40:51,117 --> 00:40:54,721
without a second
thought, but I don't know.

1028
00:41:01,127 --> 00:41:02,729
‐ Peter, I'm glad I caught you.
‐ Dr. Morgenstern.

1029
00:41:02,763 --> 00:41:05,065
I was on my way
to your apartment.

1030
00:41:05,098 --> 00:41:07,200
Listen, um, I'm
sorry about that surgery

1031
00:41:07,233 --> 00:41:08,602
but I already
had my hand in it.

1032
00:41:08,635 --> 00:41:10,170
No, no, no. You‐you
did the right thing.

1033
00:41:10,203 --> 00:41:11,672
You were
thinking on your feet.

1034
00:41:11,705 --> 00:41:13,940
That's not what I wanted
to talk to you about.

1035
00:41:13,974 --> 00:41:15,075
I wanted to let you know

1036
00:41:15,108 --> 00:41:16,777
that one
of my last two acts

1037
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:20,213
as chief of surgery,
is to rescind your suspension.

1038
00:41:22,048 --> 00:41:24,918
What do you mean?

1039
00:41:24,951 --> 00:41:28,622
That's Swanson's laparoscopy
in full living color.

1040
00:41:28,655 --> 00:41:30,657
The mistake wasn't yours.

1041
00:41:30,691 --> 00:41:33,293
I cut the gastric artery.

1042
00:41:33,326 --> 00:41:36,229
My last act as chief
will be to resign.

1043
00:41:39,299 --> 00:41:41,968
Uh...Dr. Morgenstern,
it was just one incident.

1044
00:41:42,002 --> 00:41:43,837
No.

1045
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:46,673
When I saw you
in that trauma today

1046
00:41:46,707 --> 00:41:48,241
the passion
that you exhibited.

1047
00:41:48,274 --> 00:41:51,077
It's been years
since I've felt that.

1048
00:41:51,111 --> 00:41:52,679
It might have
had something to do

1049
00:41:52,713 --> 00:41:55,081
with my heart attack,
the pressure

1050
00:41:55,115 --> 00:41:59,653
of feeling that I just
don't belong here anymore.

1051
00:41:59,686 --> 00:42:00,854
What do you mean?

1052
00:42:00,887 --> 00:42:03,223
You're a great surgeon.

1053
00:42:03,256 --> 00:42:06,727
You taught
me everything I know.

1054
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:10,030
I was a great
surgeon, but what happened..

1055
00:42:10,063 --> 00:42:12,132
...what I allowed to happen..

1056
00:42:12,165 --> 00:42:15,201
...it just proves that
I'm not a very great man.

1057
00:42:15,235 --> 00:42:17,638
That's what I
got to work on.

1058
00:42:23,109 --> 00:42:26,713
Here. You smell that?

1059
00:42:26,747 --> 00:42:27,881
What's that?

1060
00:42:27,914 --> 00:42:30,784
The smell of spring.

1061
00:42:30,817 --> 00:42:34,154
All green
and full of possibility.

1062
00:42:37,123 --> 00:42:39,860
Ramen delight.
You feeling suicidal?

1063
00:42:39,893 --> 00:42:42,763
No. I'm just...poor.

1064
00:42:42,796 --> 00:42:44,330
John Truman Carter poor?

1065
00:42:44,364 --> 00:42:46,933
It's a long story.

1066
00:42:46,967 --> 00:42:50,070
I've had a bit of a long week.

1067
00:42:50,103 --> 00:42:51,672
I overdid
it with a patient today.

1068
00:42:51,705 --> 00:42:54,274
Thought I was doing
what was best.

1069
00:42:54,307 --> 00:42:56,109
Better to overdo it
and be wrong sometimes

1070
00:42:56,142 --> 00:42:57,778
than not do anything at all.

1071
00:42:57,811 --> 00:42:59,145
Alright, I'll
tell you what.

1072
00:42:59,179 --> 00:43:01,147
Why don't you dump
that liquid sodium

1073
00:43:01,181 --> 00:43:03,216
and I'll take you out
and buy you a burger and a beer.

1074
00:43:03,249 --> 00:43:06,086
‐ I don't know.
‐ Come on. It's not an option.

1075
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:08,054
‐ Hey, guys.
‐ Hey, Jeanie.

1076
00:43:08,088 --> 00:43:09,089
Is it still raining outside?

1077
00:43:09,122 --> 00:43:10,256
No, it's not so bad.

1078
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:12,258
It's kind of nice, actually.

1079
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:26,673
‐ Peter.
‐ Hey. Uh, look.

1080
00:43:26,707 --> 00:43:28,642
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

1081
00:43:28,675 --> 00:43:29,910
Oh, come on in.
I'll turn the music down.

1082
00:43:40,854 --> 00:43:42,288
Um, let me take that.

1083
00:43:42,322 --> 00:43:44,090
Um, yeah.

1084
00:43:44,124 --> 00:43:45,726
Here, look,
you're soaking wet.

1085
00:43:45,759 --> 00:43:48,028
Uh, yeah. Cheap umbrella.

1086
00:43:48,061 --> 00:43:51,297
What possessed you
to come out in these elements?

1087
00:43:51,331 --> 00:43:54,868
My day, my week, my life.

1088
00:43:54,901 --> 00:43:56,369
I heard about Morgenstern.

1089
00:43:56,402 --> 00:43:58,238
I'm really sorry.

1090
00:44:03,143 --> 00:44:07,648
I lost my mentor
today. And the hospital?

1091
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:12,185
They lost a great surgeon.

1092
00:44:16,923 --> 00:44:19,159
You can, um..

1093
00:44:21,061 --> 00:44:22,896
...you can
be so close to somebody..

1094
00:44:25,098 --> 00:44:27,868
...and then they're gone..

1095
00:44:27,901 --> 00:44:30,270
...and you've never even
told them that you..

1096
00:44:30,303 --> 00:44:32,205
...you know how..

1097
00:44:33,439 --> 00:44:34,440
...well, you..

1098
00:44:34,474 --> 00:44:35,709
Hey, I'm sorry.

1099
00:44:35,742 --> 00:44:37,310
I'm...I'm babbling.

1100
00:44:37,343 --> 00:44:38,378
I'm not even making sense.

1101
00:44:38,411 --> 00:44:40,146
No, no, no. You are.

1102
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:41,381
You are. Go on.
