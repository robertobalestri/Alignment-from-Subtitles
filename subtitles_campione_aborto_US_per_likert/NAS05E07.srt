3
00:02:11,661 --> 00:02:13,231
<i>This can't be happening.</i>

4
00:02:13,316 --> 00:02:14,412
I can't believe they did it.

5
00:02:14,497 --> 00:02:16,025
- We knew this was coming.
- We have to do something.

6
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,193
Can we make some noise?

7
00:02:17,278 --> 00:02:19,412
- Can we go make some noise?
- That's enough!

8
00:02:20,326 --> 00:02:23,545
Right now,
you have a job to do here.

9
00:02:23,797 --> 00:02:26,100
You have patients
who need you here.

10
00:02:26,185 --> 00:02:28,787
So focus up
and get back to work.

11
00:02:30,888 --> 00:02:32,646
Now!

12
00:02:38,073 --> 00:02:39,904
Except for you.

13
00:02:43,893 --> 00:02:45,157
Do something.

14
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:46,685
As in what, Karen?

15
00:02:46,794 --> 00:02:48,451
Fix this.

16
00:02:48,726 --> 00:02:51,318
The Supreme Court
made a decision.

17
00:02:52,207 --> 00:02:55,387
What if I were to give you
all the resources

18
00:02:55,869 --> 00:02:57,771
this hospital has to offer,
carte blanche?

19
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,795
What if the only words to come
out of my mouth today were,

20
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,139
yes, and how much do you want?

21
00:03:04,186 --> 00:03:06,057
How can you help?

22
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,466
You have to cancel this tour.

23
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:14,644
- It's too late.
- They're already on their way.

24
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,154
What am I supposed to say
to a bunch of kids?

25
00:03:17,896 --> 00:03:19,638
Love denying people
their rights?

26
00:03:19,723 --> 00:03:20,959
Great, become a doctor.

27
00:03:21,044 --> 00:03:22,902
I know,
but these kids coming in,

28
00:03:22,987 --> 00:03:24,818
they're high performers
from at-risk communities

29
00:03:24,903 --> 00:03:26,014
that want to go into medicine.

30
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:27,277
Plus, they're coming from places

31
00:03:27,362 --> 00:03:29,063
most impacted by this ruling.

32
00:03:29,217 --> 00:03:31,396
So it's like Brantley said,
we got to just buckle down

33
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,875
and forget about what's
happening out there.

34
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,791
Right, forget about all
the women out there

35
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:37,097
with unwanted
or dangerous pregnancies,

36
00:03:37,181 --> 00:03:39,029
just forget about my own life.

37
00:03:39,766 --> 00:03:41,420
Your own life?

38
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,826
Yeah, it was a while ago.

39
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:46,795
I was addicted to Adderall.

40
00:03:47,278 --> 00:03:48,490
I mean, I couldn't be pregnant,

41
00:03:48,575 --> 00:03:50,303
and I really couldn't
be someone's mother.

42
00:03:53,851 --> 00:03:55,225
When was that?

43
00:03:56,026 --> 00:03:57,928
- It was a while ago.
- Why does it matter?

44
00:03:59,377 --> 00:04:01,428
Wasn't that while
we were together?

45
00:04:08,518 --> 00:04:10,225
This is where the tour starts?

46
00:04:14,065 --> 00:04:16,162
Dr. Wilder, thanks for coming.

47
00:04:16,406 --> 00:04:18,019
Of course.

48
00:04:18,353 --> 00:04:20,271
Hi, I'm Elizabeth Wilder.

49
00:04:20,355 --> 00:04:21,795
It's very nice
to meet you, Michelle.

50
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:23,185
Good to meet you.

51
00:04:24,507 --> 00:04:27,429
I assume Dr. Rao told you
about what we found

52
00:04:27,514 --> 00:04:29,514
in your cervical biopsy.

53
00:04:29,599 --> 00:04:31,389
Abnormal cells?

54
00:04:31,986 --> 00:04:33,225
That's right.

55
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:36,634
Now, unfortunately,
they are malignant,

56
00:04:36,719 --> 00:04:40,418
which tells us
that you have cervical cancer.

57
00:04:42,852 --> 00:04:44,205
Cancer?

58
00:04:44,336 --> 00:04:45,819
Based on the scans,

59
00:04:45,903 --> 00:04:49,254
the cancer
has already metastasized.

60
00:04:50,603 --> 00:04:52,173
There are no guarantees,
of course,

61
00:04:52,257 --> 00:04:54,219
but with aggressive
chemotherapy,

62
00:04:54,303 --> 00:04:56,829
your prognosis looks
very promising.

63
00:04:56,913 --> 00:04:58,091
Chemo?

64
00:04:58,175 --> 00:05:00,439
But won't that hurt my baby?

65
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:08,188
The chemical agents
in chemotherapy

66
00:05:08,272 --> 00:05:10,538
are called teratogenic.

67
00:05:10,622 --> 00:05:15,021
This means that they
will halt any pregnancy.

68
00:05:15,105 --> 00:05:16,675
Halt?

69
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:18,329
What do you mean?

70
00:05:18,413 --> 00:05:22,069
Your fetus will not survive.

71
00:05:32,601 --> 00:05:35,041
Michelle,
I cannot begin to imagine

72
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,390
what you are feeling right now.

73
00:05:36,474 --> 00:05:38,437
But my medical advice for you

74
00:05:38,521 --> 00:05:40,699
is that we schedule
a D and C this afternoon

75
00:05:40,783 --> 00:05:42,875
to start chemo
as soon as possible.

76
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,918
D and C?

77
00:05:45,936 --> 00:05:48,333
Dilation and curettage.

78
00:05:48,574 --> 00:05:50,884
It's a minor procedure
that removes the tissue

79
00:05:50,968 --> 00:05:52,406
from the inner lining
of the uterus.

80
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:55,974
- An abortion...
- Just say abortion.

81
00:05:58,004 --> 00:06:00,310
Yes, an abortion.

82
00:06:15,731 --> 00:06:18,045
Do you know what
I was doing this morning

83
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:19,881
before I came here
for what was supposed

84
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,068
to be a routine checkup?

85
00:06:22,391 --> 00:06:24,498
I was with my friends

86
00:06:25,045 --> 00:06:27,771
celebrating the end
of Roe v. Wade.

87
00:06:29,963 --> 00:06:32,896
I'm not having an abortion,
Dr. Wilder,

88
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:36,435
not today, not ever.

89
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,158
Yeah, hi,
this is Dr. Max Goodwin.

90
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,856
I'm calling
from New Amsterdam in New York.

91
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,640
Listen, I'm calling
about today's ruling.

92
00:06:52,724 --> 00:06:54,774
We have a lot of resources
to use however we can...

93
00:06:54,858 --> 00:06:57,428
To do something massive,
all right, something fast,

94
00:06:57,512 --> 00:06:59,865
something to help fix
what happened today.

95
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:02,853
So I'm listening.
How can I help?

96
00:07:02,938 --> 00:07:05,523
<i>Well, I just canceled over
half my clinic's appointments</i>

97
00:07:05,608 --> 00:07:06,829
<i>because we now live in a regime</i>

98
00:07:06,913 --> 00:07:08,353
<i>that mandates forced birth.</i>

99
00:07:08,437 --> 00:07:09,482
<i>Can you help with that?</i>

100
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,355
<i>The state's attorney
is gonna prosecute us</i>

101
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,489
<i>retroactively,
so we need a lawyer,</i>

102
00:07:13,638 --> 00:07:15,707
<i>one versed in Utah medical law,</i>

103
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:18,101
<i>the half dozen different
statutory definitions</i>

104
00:07:18,185 --> 00:07:20,607
<i>of fetal life currently under
debate in the legislature,</i>

105
00:07:20,692 --> 00:07:22,876
<i>and obviously, they got
to be Supreme Court ready.</i>

106
00:07:22,961 --> 00:07:25,197
<i>I've got a woman
with an ectopic pregnancy.</i>

107
00:07:25,322 --> 00:07:27,197
<i>It'll never come to term.</i>

108
00:07:27,353 --> 00:07:29,548
<i>If left untreated,
it'll likely kill her.</i>

109
00:07:29,632 --> 00:07:32,550
<i>And if I so much
as take an ultrasound,</i>

110
00:07:32,634 --> 00:07:34,466
<i>we could all go to jail.</i>

111
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,555
Max, most
of my patients can't miss

112
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,860
an afternoon of work,
let alone several days.

113
00:07:38,944 --> 00:07:40,993
Then there's child care,
the price of gas,

114
00:07:41,077 --> 00:07:43,670
<i>a hotel, not to mention,
my clinic is</i>

115
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:44,692
surrounded
on all sides

116
00:07:44,776 --> 00:07:48,083
by hundreds
of miles of red Texas.

117
00:07:48,518 --> 00:07:50,622
How close is your clinic
to Fort Hood?

118
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,524
The military base? Why?

119
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:59,404
There he is,
just the man I need to see.

120
00:07:59,488 --> 00:08:00,839
Sergeant Todd.

121
00:08:00,923 --> 00:08:02,798
- Dr. Goodwin.
- Tell me about Fort Hood.

122
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,408
Why? You gonna enlist?

123
00:08:04,492 --> 00:08:06,363
I'm gonna open
an abortion clinic.

124
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,513
- There's a choice!
- Just walk away!

125
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:13,614
Baby killer, murderer!

126
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:22,904
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Where are you going?

127
00:08:22,988 --> 00:08:24,428
- If you go in there...
- I need to get in there.

128
00:08:24,512 --> 00:08:25,690
You are going straight
to hell, bitch.

129
00:08:25,774 --> 00:08:26,724
- Stop it.
- You're a murderer.

130
00:08:26,809 --> 00:08:28,822
- A baby killer!
- I'm going to kill him.

131
00:08:28,907 --> 00:08:31,217
- No, no, no, no, no, wait.
- We need to de-escalate.

132
00:08:31,301 --> 00:08:32,524
See that?

133
00:08:32,608 --> 00:08:34,394
That's what abortion looks like.

134
00:08:34,478 --> 00:08:35,961
That's a dead baby.

135
00:08:36,045 --> 00:08:37,951
Show the world your face,
you murderer.

136
00:08:38,036 --> 00:08:39,686
- Sir, sir!
- Don't touch me.

137
00:08:39,771 --> 00:08:40,967
Don't you touch me.
Get away from me!

138
00:08:41,052 --> 00:08:43,447
- The police are on the way.
- Don't touch me.

139
00:08:43,531 --> 00:08:46,232
This is what
a baby killer looks like.

140
00:08:46,316 --> 00:08:48,235
- 6 feet of distance please.
- Get your hands off me.

141
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,568
Get back!

142
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,849
Okay, wait, Todd,
just hear me out.

143
00:09:05,933 --> 00:09:06,937
I rushed down here
because I thought you had

144
00:09:07,021 --> 00:09:07,968
something serious to discuss.

145
00:09:08,053 --> 00:09:09,449
Yeah, I am serious, okay?

146
00:09:09,545 --> 00:09:10,897
Fort Hood is on federal land,
which means that it's

147
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:12,420
not subject to state law.

148
00:09:12,504 --> 00:09:14,756
Or the crazy whims of
progressive medical directors.

149
00:09:14,841 --> 00:09:17,482
Military bases have always
been used in tough times,

150
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:20,045
emergency housing
for hurricane victims

151
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,787
or quarantine wards
during the pandemic.

152
00:09:21,872 --> 00:09:23,045
This is not that.

153
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,779
Okay, but if the military
can lease land

154
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:27,248
to freaking Starbucks
and Taco Bell,

155
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,850
then maybe they can lease it

156
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:31,740
to protect people's
right to have an abortion.

157
00:09:31,825 --> 00:09:33,943
The military exists
to defend the Constitution.

158
00:09:34,028 --> 00:09:36,123
Nowhere in the Constitution
does it state that a person

159
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,314
has a right to an abortion.

160
00:09:37,398 --> 00:09:39,256
Also nowhere
in the original Constitution

161
00:09:39,341 --> 00:09:42,115
does it state the right to
privacy or the right to vote,

162
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,795
but we can infer them
from the other things

163
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,248
that the Constitution does say.

164
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,150
- Really?
- There's no right to vote?

165
00:09:47,515 --> 00:09:49,021
Nowhere,
and I just looked it up,

166
00:09:49,106 --> 00:09:50,717
knowing that
we would have this exact fight,

167
00:09:50,802 --> 00:09:51,950
so kudos to me.

168
00:09:52,107 --> 00:09:53,244
- Great.
- Shall we?

169
00:09:53,328 --> 00:09:56,225
The military was created
to protect its citizens

170
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:59,389
against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

171
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:00,998
Now you're suggesting
the U.S. Supreme Court

172
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:01,975
is an enemy of the state?

173
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,756
No, Todd, I am
not suggesting that, all right?

174
00:10:04,841 --> 00:10:07,475
What I am suggesting is that
the United States government

175
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,614
is intruding
on the private lives

176
00:10:09,716 --> 00:10:12,607
of its American citizens.

177
00:10:17,656 --> 00:10:20,793
- You know I'm a libertarian?
- Oh, I do.

178
00:10:20,877 --> 00:10:22,920
Now you're deliberately
talking like a libertarian

179
00:10:23,005 --> 00:10:24,014
to get me to change my mind.

180
00:10:24,098 --> 00:10:27,428
Yes, I am because I know
that marching into a room full

181
00:10:27,513 --> 00:10:29,811
of military guys and making
a rights-based argument

182
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:31,139
that they should open
an abortion clinic

183
00:10:31,224 --> 00:10:33,489
on an Army base is just
the kind of contrarian thing

184
00:10:33,623 --> 00:10:35,903
that makes libertarians
like you get up in the morning.

185
00:10:38,035 --> 00:10:40,281
Fort Hood is a nonstarter.

186
00:10:40,653 --> 00:10:43,834
But we might find
a more sympathetic ear

187
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,607
at Joint Base Camp Bullis.

188
00:10:45,864 --> 00:10:47,341
- Bullis?
- Yeah.

189
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:50,842
I'll make some calls.

190
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,428
That man was
harassing a patient.

191
00:11:04,513 --> 00:11:07,491
I couldn't just ignore it.
So I stepped in to de-escalate.

192
00:11:07,764 --> 00:11:08,943
And then you clocked him.

193
00:11:09,028 --> 00:11:10,897
It was an accident. I don't...

194
00:11:10,982 --> 00:11:13,350
Dr. Frome, this man
wants to put you in jail

195
00:11:13,435 --> 00:11:14,673
and sue the hospital.

196
00:11:14,921 --> 00:11:16,326
He what?

197
00:11:16,411 --> 00:11:19,240
Luckily for you, our council
has managed to broker a deal,

198
00:11:19,325 --> 00:11:20,561
and he's agreed
to drop the charges.

199
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:22,193
- He has?
- On one condition.

200
00:11:22,278 --> 00:11:23,856
What condition? Anything.

201
00:11:24,239 --> 00:11:25,640
He wants an apology.

202
00:11:26,481 --> 00:11:28,552
- That's it?
- He wants an apology?

203
00:11:35,034 --> 00:11:36,950
I can't.

204
00:11:43,263 --> 00:11:46,951
And this is the operating room

205
00:11:47,036 --> 00:11:50,778
where we perform operations.

206
00:11:51,138 --> 00:11:54,362
And here we have Doctor...

207
00:11:56,857 --> 00:11:58,237
Winters.

208
00:11:58,321 --> 00:11:59,967
Yes, I'm so sorry.

209
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,369
Dr. Winters is an excellent...

210
00:12:07,705 --> 00:12:10,099
Anesthesiologist.

211
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,522
With whom you've worked
for many years.

212
00:12:14,607 --> 00:12:16,294
Of course.

213
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,517
All you, Dr. Winters.

214
00:12:21,605 --> 00:12:23,871
Thank you, Dr. Reynolds.

215
00:12:23,956 --> 00:12:26,005
Welcome to New Amsterdam.

216
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:28,575
We're so excited to have you.

217
00:12:29,028 --> 00:12:31,750
- I think we need to talk.
- About what?

218
00:12:32,036 --> 00:12:34,255
- About what?
- About what you told me.

219
00:12:34,341 --> 00:12:36,404
I don't really think
there's anything to talk about.

220
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,857
I got pregnant.
I got an abortion.

221
00:12:38,942 --> 00:12:41,153
It's definitely your choice
to make, but...

222
00:12:42,938 --> 00:12:44,115
But?

223
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,111
You didn't tell me?

224
00:12:46,572 --> 00:12:48,139
I mean, what,
did you think I was gonna be

225
00:12:48,224 --> 00:12:49,232
upset with you or something?

226
00:12:49,317 --> 00:12:50,615
Okay, this may blow your mind,

227
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,896
but I wasn't thinking
about your feelings

228
00:12:53,021 --> 00:12:54,115
very much at all.

229
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,967
Look, I'm not saying
my needs come before yours.

230
00:12:57,052 --> 00:12:59,944
I'm... I don't know,
Lauren, I'm just having

231
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,381
a very human reaction
to the fact

232
00:13:01,465 --> 00:13:03,383
that you and I conceived a baby.

233
00:13:03,467 --> 00:13:06,256
An embryo, one that neither
of us planned for or wanted.

234
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:09,041
No, no, no,
you didn't know what I did

235
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,913
and didn't want
because you didn't ask.

236
00:13:10,997 --> 00:13:13,306
Well, I took your dumping me
as a pretty clear indication.

237
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,916
But we were
still friends, Lauren.

238
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,790
We were seeing each other.
We almost had a child together.

239
00:13:17,874 --> 00:13:20,096
Isn't that something
that I'd have a right to know?

240
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,401
I mean,
wouldn't you think that that

241
00:13:21,485 --> 00:13:22,911
that would mean something to me?

242
00:13:22,996 --> 00:13:25,450
Right, so when you told me I
didn't fit into your life plan,

243
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,536
me having your baby
would have changed that?

244
00:13:27,621 --> 00:13:29,396
It's...

245
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:31,233
They're ready to move on.

246
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:39,302
Without chemo, she's gonna die.

247
00:13:39,495 --> 00:13:41,109
We just got to figure out
a way to get her

248
00:13:41,194 --> 00:13:43,200
through her second trimester.

249
00:13:43,285 --> 00:13:46,290
After that, we can administer
chemo with little risk

250
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:47,467
to the fetus.

251
00:13:47,643 --> 00:13:50,614
Okay,
so what about vaccine therapy?

252
00:13:50,795 --> 00:13:52,794
It won't work
for cervical cancer.

253
00:13:52,951 --> 00:13:54,872
Targeted radiation?

254
00:13:54,957 --> 00:13:56,353
Not targeted enough.

255
00:13:56,438 --> 00:13:59,802
It's the same problem,
the fetus will be compromised.

256
00:14:00,568 --> 00:14:02,269
Of all the days
to get this patient.

257
00:14:02,353 --> 00:14:04,441
It's like, are you kidding me?

258
00:14:05,966 --> 00:14:09,713
Dr. Rao, with all due respect,

259
00:14:09,969 --> 00:14:11,646
let's not let
our personal feelings

260
00:14:11,731 --> 00:14:12,954
get in the way
of helping our patient.

261
00:14:13,055 --> 00:14:14,798
Our patient
is getting in the way

262
00:14:14,883 --> 00:14:16,887
of helping our patient.

263
00:14:16,972 --> 00:14:20,632
She's asking for a choice,
just like we would.

264
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,744
Well, I can't think of any.

265
00:14:22,938 --> 00:14:24,271
Can you?

266
00:14:26,525 --> 00:14:28,048
I can think of one.

267
00:14:32,383 --> 00:14:33,794
Michelle,
we're gonna to try something.

268
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:36,146
It's not chemo.
It's not radiation.

269
00:14:36,231 --> 00:14:39,271
It's surgery,
an aggressive and risky one.

270
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,950
We're gonna resect several
of your organs

271
00:14:42,046 --> 00:14:43,180
to remove the growth.

272
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,833
Even if we get it all,

273
00:14:44,933 --> 00:14:47,983
and there is absolutely
no guarantee that we will,

274
00:14:48,184 --> 00:14:50,320
you're gonna be dealing
with lifelong consequences.

275
00:14:50,405 --> 00:14:52,932
In all likelihood, you will
have to wear a colostomy bag

276
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,825
for the rest of your life.

277
00:14:55,868 --> 00:14:57,763
Now, I really want to be clear

278
00:14:57,848 --> 00:15:00,071
that this is not
what I recommend.

279
00:15:00,156 --> 00:15:02,414
But it is the only option
that allows you

280
00:15:02,499 --> 00:15:04,156
to preserve your pregnancy
and gives you

281
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,607
a chance to survive.

282
00:15:09,985 --> 00:15:13,510
Thank you for hearing me.

283
00:15:24,479 --> 00:15:26,092
Todd, tell me something good.

284
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:27,329
It's a no-go.

285
00:15:27,414 --> 00:15:29,420
Why not?

286
00:15:29,701 --> 00:15:32,151
Gah, give me one good reason
that they'll rent space

287
00:15:32,236 --> 00:15:33,314
to a frickin' Applebee's,

288
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,230
but not
reproductive health services.

289
00:15:35,336 --> 00:15:36,862
Because one sells hot wings,

290
00:15:36,947 --> 00:15:38,474
and the other
is a logistical nightmare

291
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:40,519
and a massive security risk
to everyone on that base.

292
00:15:40,604 --> 00:15:43,044
Yeah, so you're telling me
that protecting pregnant people

293
00:15:43,129 --> 00:15:45,657
would be what,
difficult, maybe dangerous?

294
00:15:45,742 --> 00:15:46,790
- Yes.
- Yeah.

295
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:49,577
Kind of sounds like the thing
the military was made for.

296
00:15:50,184 --> 00:15:53,798
Max, this whole
federal land loophole...

297
00:15:53,897 --> 00:15:55,157
It isn't real.

298
00:15:55,294 --> 00:15:58,214
State land, federal land...
It's all just words.

299
00:15:58,493 --> 00:16:00,803
Texas is a conservative state.

300
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:03,743
That doesn't stop just because
somebody draws a border.

301
00:16:05,856 --> 00:16:08,446
But what about the border
that no one drew?

302
00:16:11,177 --> 00:16:13,226
You know, I could say cryptic
things and just leave too.

303
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,486
Thank you for your service.

304
00:16:14,571 --> 00:16:16,269
Love you, Todd!

305
00:16:23,674 --> 00:16:25,892
Oh, great.

306
00:16:26,782 --> 00:16:29,025
Brantley brought in
the big guns, huh?

307
00:16:29,332 --> 00:16:32,025
She wanted me
to talk some sense into you.

308
00:16:32,205 --> 00:16:33,425
I couldn't do it, Martin.

309
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:34,948
I couldn't apologize
to that guy.

310
00:16:35,033 --> 00:16:36,275
Look at him.

311
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,358
I know it would make
this whole thing go away,

312
00:16:38,443 --> 00:16:39,282
would make it so easy,

313
00:16:39,367 --> 00:16:41,079
but the way he was
treating that woman,

314
00:16:41,186 --> 00:16:42,962
the way he thought he could
treat another human being.

315
00:16:43,047 --> 00:16:44,661
I can't. I'm not gonna do it.

316
00:16:44,746 --> 00:16:47,095
I won't apologize.
You need to accept that.

317
00:16:48,227 --> 00:16:49,556
I do.

318
00:16:51,918 --> 00:16:55,907
And I'm proud of you.

319
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,111
You refused to back down
from something you believed in.

320
00:17:00,515 --> 00:17:04,243
That's the noble,
stubborn Iggy that I know.

321
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:06,196
Yeah?

322
00:17:07,992 --> 00:17:09,775
And now you need to apologize.

323
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,169
What?

324
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:13,033
We have children.

325
00:17:13,289 --> 00:17:15,947
And if one of their parents
lost their jobs

326
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,437
and gained a criminal record,
that would spell trouble

327
00:17:18,522 --> 00:17:19,548
even in the best of times.

328
00:17:19,633 --> 00:17:22,017
But now, with Roe overturned,
come on, Iggy,

329
00:17:22,106 --> 00:17:25,587
it's right there written
in Clarence Thomas's opinion

330
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:28,095
that the court should reconsider

331
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,939
outlawing gay marriage.

332
00:17:32,711 --> 00:17:36,144
We could be living
in a country that could take

333
00:17:36,229 --> 00:17:38,056
our children away from us.

334
00:17:38,772 --> 00:17:40,516
If we've got to
fight that fight,

335
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,439
and you have
a criminal record...

336
00:17:46,012 --> 00:17:48,728
We can't take our lives
for granted anymore.

337
00:17:51,058 --> 00:17:52,868
They're our kids.

338
00:17:54,201 --> 00:17:58,446
We've got to protect them
with everything we have.

339
00:18:02,203 --> 00:18:04,160
You're right.

340
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:11,009
I'll do it.

341
00:18:18,616 --> 00:18:20,055
Right, you know when
you get blood work done

342
00:18:20,139 --> 00:18:21,840
and someone sends
you the results?

343
00:18:21,924 --> 00:18:23,538
This is where the magic happens.

344
00:18:23,622 --> 00:18:24,939
You're up.

345
00:18:25,032 --> 00:18:26,759
I don't know
if I'd call it magic,

346
00:18:26,844 --> 00:18:28,993
but it is pretty special.

347
00:18:29,295 --> 00:18:32,227
Hey, everyone.
So this is a centrifuge.

348
00:18:32,327 --> 00:18:35,095
It allows platelets
and blood plasma to be isolated

349
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,095
from other blood components.

350
00:18:38,736 --> 00:18:40,860
I should have told you
because we're friends.

351
00:18:40,945 --> 00:18:41,985
Yeah.

352
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,725
Because it would
have made a difference.

353
00:18:44,096 --> 00:18:46,494
No, no, I don't buy
that for one second.

354
00:18:46,657 --> 00:18:48,749
This is really
about you wanting a say

355
00:18:48,834 --> 00:18:50,665
in what I do with my life.

356
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:51,767
Whoa, hold up.

357
00:18:51,852 --> 00:18:54,275
All I did was ask a question
about something

358
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,259
that had to do with me.

359
00:18:55,344 --> 00:18:57,350
It's what happens every time.

360
00:18:57,746 --> 00:18:59,794
Every time men, good men,

361
00:18:59,918 --> 00:19:01,900
have a conversation
about abortion,

362
00:19:02,104 --> 00:19:04,284
it's all women's rights
and, "We're your ally,"

363
00:19:04,369 --> 00:19:06,556
right up until the point
the abortion affects them.

364
00:19:06,641 --> 00:19:09,212
And that is what is
happening here, Floyd.

365
00:19:09,568 --> 00:19:12,204
Because we're not talking
about my abortion, are we?

366
00:19:12,696 --> 00:19:16,001
No, we're talking about how
you feel about my abortion.

367
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,495
We're suddenly,
but not surprisingly,

368
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,181
taking care of you.

369
00:19:28,327 --> 00:19:30,384
What were
your feelings about it?

370
00:19:33,221 --> 00:19:35,138
My feelings?

371
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:36,782
I didn't have any.

372
00:19:37,207 --> 00:19:38,665
It was not a big deal.

373
00:19:41,961 --> 00:19:43,798
If it wasn't a big deal,

374
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:46,689
why did it take you five years
to tell me about it?

375
00:19:53,546 --> 00:19:54,790
Hi.

376
00:19:54,962 --> 00:19:57,490
I showed them all
the bells and whistles.

377
00:19:57,652 --> 00:20:00,259
Do you all need more time, or...

378
00:20:06,103 --> 00:20:08,743
Gentle, gentle, easy.

379
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,598
Gravid uterus intact.

380
00:20:15,683 --> 00:20:17,509
No sign of tumor invasion.

381
00:20:17,788 --> 00:20:19,226
Suction.

382
00:20:19,311 --> 00:20:21,096
Richardson?

383
00:20:25,837 --> 00:20:29,281
Expansive tumor,
invading multiple organs.

384
00:20:29,366 --> 00:20:31,673
It's gonna be a wide incision.

385
00:20:36,262 --> 00:20:38,090
Scalpel.

386
00:20:41,135 --> 00:20:42,431
Scalpel.

387
00:20:48,007 --> 00:20:49,359
What?

388
00:20:49,444 --> 00:20:51,720
It's just that this is
a lot of hospital resources

389
00:20:51,805 --> 00:20:54,220
for something that can be
dealt with in a simpler way.

390
00:20:54,305 --> 00:20:56,142
And it's risky.

391
00:20:58,478 --> 00:20:59,767
Scalpel!

392
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:07,943
You cut now,
and that's her bladder.

393
00:21:08,028 --> 00:21:10,164
That's Foley catheter for the
rest of her life, Elizabeth.

394
00:21:10,388 --> 00:21:12,806
You cut her bowel,
and that's a colostomy bag.

395
00:21:13,487 --> 00:21:15,173
Are you sure
this woman's politics

396
00:21:15,258 --> 00:21:17,407
are worth
the physical sacrifice?

397
00:21:19,618 --> 00:21:20,751
All right, look.

398
00:21:20,836 --> 00:21:23,531
When a patient comes to me,
I don't see their beliefs.

399
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,695
I see their cancer.

400
00:21:26,247 --> 00:21:27,734
And I listen to what they need.

401
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:30,359
So you and this entire team
are gonna do what

402
00:21:30,444 --> 00:21:32,719
this patient needs you to do!

403
00:21:33,985 --> 00:21:36,075
Is that clear?

404
00:21:37,627 --> 00:21:39,410
Yes.

405
00:21:47,722 --> 00:21:51,091
When I said carte blanche,
Max, I wasn't expecting this.

406
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:53,095
Well, you told me
to take on the world.

407
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,154
- So why not start here?
- An old boat.

408
00:21:56,239 --> 00:21:58,113
Well, not just any boat, okay?

409
00:21:58,197 --> 00:22:01,769
The first in our fleet
because we are starting

410
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:07,013
our very own line
of floating abortion clinics.

411
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,567
Oh, you're serious.

412
00:22:11,652 --> 00:22:14,135
Yes, yes, do you know
where you can't gamble?

413
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,099
Hawaii. But guess where you can.

414
00:22:16,184 --> 00:22:18,787
In the federal waters just
off the coast of Hawaii.

415
00:22:18,872 --> 00:22:21,240
All right, they made it illegal
to get an abortion in Texas.

416
00:22:21,325 --> 00:22:22,852
Well then,
how about the Gulf of Mexico,

417
00:22:22,937 --> 00:22:24,157
federal waters?

418
00:22:24,339 --> 00:22:25,302
How would this all work?

419
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:27,372
All right,
so about 9 miles off the coast,

420
00:22:27,457 --> 00:22:29,435
we could run a floating clinic.

421
00:22:29,562 --> 00:22:31,872
And it would be perfectly legal.

422
00:22:31,957 --> 00:22:33,745
We wouldn't be violating
any state laws.

423
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,405
- And it would be safe?
- Yes.

424
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:37,138
All right, I spoke
to a doctor friend of mine

425
00:22:37,302 --> 00:22:38,313
who runs a hospital ship.

426
00:22:38,397 --> 00:22:39,488
He told me everything
I need to know

427
00:22:39,572 --> 00:22:41,317
to get it running
and down south.

428
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:42,709
And honestly,
it's not that different

429
00:22:42,793 --> 00:22:43,951
from running a clinic on land.

430
00:22:44,057 --> 00:22:45,224
How long would you need?

431
00:22:45,309 --> 00:22:46,724
I don't know, a few days.

432
00:22:46,809 --> 00:22:50,673
And then we get it down around
Florida and past Louisiana.

433
00:22:50,758 --> 00:22:52,544
And then it's a straight shot
to Galveston.

434
00:22:52,628 --> 00:22:54,111
I can't believe I'm saying it,

435
00:22:54,195 --> 00:22:56,732
but this could actually work.

436
00:22:56,817 --> 00:22:58,866
Did I hear you say Galveston?

437
00:22:59,061 --> 00:23:01,138
Yeah, that's right.

438
00:23:01,322 --> 00:23:03,893
There's no way this boat's
making it to Galveston.

439
00:23:03,978 --> 00:23:07,202
Truth be told, she can
barely make it to Jersey.

440
00:23:07,426 --> 00:23:11,563
Uh, I was told
she was seaworthy.

441
00:23:11,647 --> 00:23:13,505
Yeah, for a floating
nightclub maybe.

442
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,596
But I wouldn't advise
taking her out of the harbor

443
00:23:15,681 --> 00:23:17,349
unless you like swimming.

444
00:23:17,985 --> 00:23:20,107
So much for being a pirate.

445
00:23:25,034 --> 00:23:26,601
That's it.

446
00:23:27,585 --> 00:23:28,936
That's it, Karen.

447
00:23:29,036 --> 00:23:30,564
I keep trying to think
of all these legal ways

448
00:23:30,649 --> 00:23:32,388
around this decision,
when obviously,

449
00:23:32,473 --> 00:23:36,841
the only solution is
actually completely illegal.

450
00:23:56,459 --> 00:23:58,943
I am afraid for this country.

451
00:23:59,169 --> 00:24:01,075
I'm afraid
of what is gonna happen

452
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:02,903
if we don't start
listening to one another

453
00:24:02,987 --> 00:24:04,687
because I think that
that's the only thing

454
00:24:04,771 --> 00:24:06,811
that will break
this cycle of hate

455
00:24:06,896 --> 00:24:08,427
that's tearing us apart.

456
00:24:08,512 --> 00:24:11,997
Now, I'm sure for you,
abortion is cut and dry.

457
00:24:12,082 --> 00:24:13,138
It's murder.

458
00:24:13,223 --> 00:24:16,216
That is a concept
that is utterly alien to me.

459
00:24:17,068 --> 00:24:18,951
But I accept your right
to believe it.

460
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,746
- Where's my apology?
- I'm getting to it!

461
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:23,924
Because I believe in rights,
just like you.

462
00:24:24,008 --> 00:24:25,883
We get to bear arms.
We have the right to bear arms.

463
00:24:25,967 --> 00:24:27,361
You believe in that, right?
Don't you?

464
00:24:27,445 --> 00:24:28,716
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you do.

465
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,277
Would you want the government
to take that right away?

466
00:24:30,362 --> 00:24:30,935
No.

467
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,232
So then why would you take
that woman's rights away?

468
00:24:33,317 --> 00:24:35,186
Shouldn't people have rights
over their own body?

469
00:24:35,271 --> 00:24:36,873
Now, you say
that you believe the right

470
00:24:36,958 --> 00:24:38,263
to rail
against government overreach.

471
00:24:38,372 --> 00:24:39,765
But there
is only one group of people

472
00:24:39,849 --> 00:24:41,681
that had anything taken
away from them today,

473
00:24:41,765 --> 00:24:43,683
people who seek abortions.

474
00:24:43,767 --> 00:24:44,989
I know it's hard
for you to believe,

475
00:24:45,073 --> 00:24:47,435
but you had nothing
taken from you today.

476
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,217
You think it's okay
to walk up to a stranger

477
00:24:49,302 --> 00:24:50,473
and antagonize them?

478
00:24:50,557 --> 00:24:52,257
For what?
What world do you live in?

479
00:24:52,341 --> 00:24:53,824
What country do you live in?

480
00:24:53,908 --> 00:24:54,825
That's not the world
I want to live in.

481
00:24:54,909 --> 00:24:55,872
And you know what else?

482
00:24:55,957 --> 00:24:57,920
This is not an apology,
not anymore.

483
00:24:58,039 --> 00:24:59,123
- Iggy...
- No... and another thing.

484
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:00,656
I punched you
in the face on purpose.

485
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,962
I loved it.

486
00:25:02,046 --> 00:25:04,311
I would punch you
in the face again, gladly.

487
00:25:04,395 --> 00:25:07,011
I am standing up for rights,
even yours, you jerk.

488
00:25:07,095 --> 00:25:08,272
Iggy, Iggy...

489
00:25:08,356 --> 00:25:09,621
If that means
I'm committing a crime,

490
00:25:09,705 --> 00:25:10,888
then take me to jail.

491
00:25:10,973 --> 00:25:12,673
Iggy.

492
00:25:12,926 --> 00:25:14,580
Iggy.

493
00:25:15,583 --> 00:25:17,281
Well?

494
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,568
Uh...

495
00:25:21,042 --> 00:25:22,264
I apologize.

496
00:25:22,481 --> 00:25:23,656
I should not have hit you.

497
00:25:29,927 --> 00:25:31,357
Okay.

498
00:25:31,641 --> 00:25:34,251
All right, free to go.

499
00:25:40,935 --> 00:25:45,831
All right, so that is life
in medicine, I guess.

500
00:25:46,076 --> 00:25:47,881
I hope you guys learned a lot.

501
00:25:47,966 --> 00:25:49,401
And thank you for coming.

502
00:25:49,578 --> 00:25:51,404
Any questions?

503
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:55,712
Right... oh, that was rhetorical,

504
00:25:55,796 --> 00:25:57,513
but, yeah, okay, you.

505
00:25:57,797 --> 00:26:00,201
I'm kind of thinking
this huge thing

506
00:26:00,286 --> 00:26:02,544
happened today,
but like, you guys haven't

507
00:26:02,628 --> 00:26:04,110
said anything about it.

508
00:26:04,194 --> 00:26:06,675
You're acting like it
didn't even happen.

509
00:26:11,263 --> 00:26:13,365
Right. Um...

510
00:26:14,471 --> 00:26:15,912
uh. Thank you...

511
00:26:16,099 --> 00:26:19,349
- Kisha.
- Kisha.

512
00:26:26,536 --> 00:26:30,427
I've had two abortions.

513
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:35,380
I got my first
when I was in college.

514
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,466
I was 20.

515
00:26:37,968 --> 00:26:39,668
Someone slipped something
in my drink,

516
00:26:39,755 --> 00:26:41,800
and I woke up
in a stranger's bed

517
00:26:41,884 --> 00:26:45,122
with no memory
of what had happened to me.

518
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:49,872
And I got the second one
around five years ago.

519
00:26:51,852 --> 00:26:54,076
I was falling in love
with someone

520
00:26:54,985 --> 00:26:57,615
who would have made
an amazing father.

521
00:26:58,091 --> 00:27:00,810
But he told me that
I didn't fit into his future.

522
00:27:05,343 --> 00:27:10,479
Those were both
very difficult times for me.

523
00:27:12,654 --> 00:27:15,217
But deciding whether or not
to have an abortion,

524
00:27:15,302 --> 00:27:17,029
I mean, that was clear.

525
00:27:18,224 --> 00:27:20,926
And I was able to do the right,
responsible thing.

526
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:24,294
And I was able to get it
done safely and quickly.

527
00:27:25,005 --> 00:27:26,911
But you know what?

528
00:27:27,191 --> 00:27:30,328
The circumstances...
They shouldn't even matter.

529
00:27:30,622 --> 00:27:32,286
You should be able
to get an abortion

530
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:35,420
simply because you are pregnant
and you don't want to be.

531
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,529
I mean, that is
the very definition of choice.

532
00:27:41,572 --> 00:27:43,229
Dr. Reynolds and I...

533
00:27:43,427 --> 00:27:46,036
We became doctors
to help people.

534
00:27:46,776 --> 00:27:49,091
That's why we come
here every day.

535
00:27:50,695 --> 00:27:52,677
It's our strongest calling.

536
00:27:54,544 --> 00:27:56,888
Do you want to know
what I think about today's ruling?

537
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:04,138
You guys want to be doctors,
nurses, med techs.

538
00:28:05,732 --> 00:28:07,059
Well, then you
should really think

539
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:09,857
about getting into obstetrics
and gynecology

540
00:28:12,193 --> 00:28:16,505
because we really need you
now more than ever.

541
00:28:34,771 --> 00:28:36,216
How did it go?

542
00:28:36,525 --> 00:28:37,974
Were you able to get all of it?

543
00:28:38,435 --> 00:28:42,099
Michelle, we had
to pull out of your surgery.

544
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:45,882
The cancer progressed
further than the scan showed.

545
00:28:45,966 --> 00:28:48,755
I was not able to resect all
of the cancerous tissue.

546
00:28:49,392 --> 00:28:51,263
So what now?

547
00:28:54,322 --> 00:28:57,762
Well, now I recommend
that we look at other options.

548
00:28:57,846 --> 00:28:59,716
Abortion?

549
00:29:00,501 --> 00:29:03,374
To save your life, yes.

550
00:29:05,028 --> 00:29:08,033
Thank you for trying,
Dr. Wilder.

551
00:29:08,117 --> 00:29:10,511
But I think I need
to find another doctor.

552
00:29:12,643 --> 00:29:18,001
Michelle, can you try to
not make this about politics?

553
00:29:18,085 --> 00:29:19,959
This here is a medical decision.

554
00:29:20,043 --> 00:29:21,613
And that's it.

555
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:26,312
This isn't just politics,
Dr. Wilder, not to me.

556
00:29:26,536 --> 00:29:30,388
These are my beliefs,
my core, my values.

557
00:29:30,763 --> 00:29:33,433
You're asking me
to change who I am.

558
00:29:34,535 --> 00:29:36,495
To save your life.

559
00:29:36,794 --> 00:29:39,263
Would you kill someone
to save your life?

560
00:29:40,136 --> 00:29:42,228
It's not the same thing.

561
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:44,513
To me it is.

562
00:29:46,155 --> 00:29:48,302
Look, I know you're
just trying to help me.

563
00:29:48,791 --> 00:29:50,752
So here's how you
can change my mind.

564
00:29:51,008 --> 00:29:53,904
Tell me what
you believe in most,

565
00:29:54,034 --> 00:29:57,732
that thing at your core
that makes you you,

566
00:29:58,349 --> 00:30:00,129
and then betray it.

567
00:30:00,474 --> 00:30:04,716
Rip out who you are,
everything you think is right,

568
00:30:05,255 --> 00:30:07,919
and do it
for a medical decision.

569
00:30:08,185 --> 00:30:09,786
Can you do that?

570
00:30:10,049 --> 00:30:13,302
Because if you can,
I'll get the chemo.

571
00:30:21,103 --> 00:30:23,474
<i>Tell me there is
a cruise ship heading our way.</i>

572
00:30:23,612 --> 00:30:25,762
The one I found would have ended

573
00:30:25,847 --> 00:30:27,113
a little more like the Titanic.

574
00:30:27,197 --> 00:30:28,854
Well, we knew
it was a long shot.

575
00:30:28,938 --> 00:30:30,290
Yeah, but I have a better idea.

576
00:30:30,374 --> 00:30:32,815
Do me a favor.
Look out your window.

577
00:30:32,899 --> 00:30:33,990
Right across the street,

578
00:30:34,074 --> 00:30:35,165
you're gonna see
an old warehouse for sale.

579
00:30:35,249 --> 00:30:37,384
Okay, I don't see
any for sale sign.

580
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:38,864
Well,
that's because I bought it.

581
00:30:38,948 --> 00:30:40,299
- Max.
- Yeah.

582
00:30:40,383 --> 00:30:41,606
I mean, it's gotta go
through inspections

583
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:43,086
and everything,
but I put the offer in.

584
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:45,459
Point is, I can make it
an underground clinic.

585
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:47,350
All right, it'll be safe,
it'll be hidden,

586
00:30:47,434 --> 00:30:49,135
and it'll be run
by medical professionals.

587
00:30:49,219 --> 00:30:51,310
You're asking me
to do something illegal.

588
00:30:51,394 --> 00:30:53,357
Yes, yes,
it's the illegal thing,

589
00:30:53,441 --> 00:30:55,967
but it's the moral thing
to do, okay?

590
00:30:56,051 --> 00:30:58,046
You'll have our doctors
by your side.

591
00:30:58,131 --> 00:31:00,612
I will be by your side.
Just say the word.

592
00:31:02,579 --> 00:31:04,498
I'm not putting
other doctors at risk.

593
00:31:04,582 --> 00:31:05,934
<i>Don't ask me to.</i>

594
00:31:06,018 --> 00:31:08,241
All of these can go in those.

595
00:31:08,497 --> 00:31:12,028
Look, I got to go, Max.

596
00:31:12,193 --> 00:31:14,246
We're clearing the place out,
shutting it down.

597
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,378
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

598
00:31:15,462 --> 00:31:17,163
What about a whole floor
at New Amsterdam

599
00:31:17,247 --> 00:31:18,764
dedicated to helping
your patients?

600
00:31:18,849 --> 00:31:20,297
I don't think that's the option.

601
00:31:20,381 --> 00:31:22,080
I mean, you'd have
to relocate, but we have funds.

602
00:31:22,164 --> 00:31:23,908
We could fly your patients
up from Texas.

603
00:31:23,992 --> 00:31:25,685
Okay, what about new patients?

604
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:27,474
We'll figure it out.

605
00:31:31,044 --> 00:31:32,875
I'm not leaving
my community behind.

606
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:34,963
I can't. They know me here.

607
00:31:35,047 --> 00:31:36,935
They need me, especially now.

608
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:40,115
Look, I know you wanted to help.

609
00:31:40,645 --> 00:31:42,515
I wish you could have.

610
00:31:44,448 --> 00:31:49,062
<i>Orthopedics, dial 722,
orthopedics 722.</i>

611
00:31:57,286 --> 00:31:58,419
You're serious?

612
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,715
You just sent her home?

613
00:32:00,863 --> 00:32:03,939
You couldn't convince her
to even think about the chemo.

614
00:32:04,726 --> 00:32:06,926
It's not about convincing.

615
00:32:07,052 --> 00:32:08,884
It's about this woman's beliefs.

616
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:10,667
You mean her politics.

617
00:32:10,751 --> 00:32:12,848
Well, okay, politics, beliefs.

618
00:32:12,936 --> 00:32:14,462
For her, that's the same thing.

619
00:32:14,624 --> 00:32:18,630
And for me, it is too.
I'm no different.

620
00:32:18,715 --> 00:32:23,419
She asked me what it is that I
believe in enough to die for.

621
00:32:23,503 --> 00:32:26,746
And this is it,
the right to choose.

622
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,473
Because politics do matter.

623
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:32,910
We're both guilty,
or noble, or...

624
00:32:33,082 --> 00:32:35,260
Honestly,
I don't even know anymore.

625
00:32:35,384 --> 00:32:37,192
So that's it?

626
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,142
A fetus is going to grow
inside a mother

627
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,848
who won't be there to raise it.

628
00:32:42,131 --> 00:32:45,942
The cancer will kill her,
and there's nothing we can do.

629
00:32:47,263 --> 00:32:49,267
The cancer is not killing her.

630
00:32:49,352 --> 00:32:51,121
Politics are.

631
00:32:52,271 --> 00:32:54,200
I don't have the cure for that.

632
00:32:54,357 --> 00:32:55,926
Does anyone?

633
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,768
You're gonna do great.

634
00:33:11,121 --> 00:33:12,559
So?

635
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,942
Mission accomplished.

636
00:33:15,097 --> 00:33:17,591
It meant a lot to those kids,
hearing what you went through.

637
00:33:17,676 --> 00:33:19,649
I mean, you taught them more
about medicine and caring

638
00:33:19,733 --> 00:33:21,781
than a hundred hospital tours
could have.

639
00:33:21,865 --> 00:33:25,218
And I think I learned
a couple of things myself.

640
00:33:27,129 --> 00:33:28,746
Are we good?

641
00:33:30,291 --> 00:33:34,294
Yeah, yeah, we're good.

642
00:33:36,316 --> 00:33:37,838
Okay.

643
00:34:00,443 --> 00:34:02,981
Well, I got nowhere today.

644
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,981
In the summer of 1968,

645
00:34:07,066 --> 00:34:09,764
I was a junior
at Sarah Lawrence.

646
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:15,832
My best friend, Patty Me eh an,
got in trouble.

647
00:34:15,997 --> 00:34:19,762
She was 19, pre-law,
smarter than all of us,

648
00:34:19,903 --> 00:34:21,426
whole world ahead of her.

649
00:34:21,511 --> 00:34:22,879
She wanted many things,

650
00:34:22,964 --> 00:34:24,996
but being a mom at 19
wasn't one of them.

651
00:34:25,869 --> 00:34:28,223
Boy walked away, no surprise.

652
00:34:29,498 --> 00:34:31,434
So we found a place.

653
00:34:32,808 --> 00:34:36,481
It was all illegal then,
back of a salon.

654
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:42,293
As soon as we walked in,
I grabbed her hand.

655
00:34:44,038 --> 00:34:46,426
I remember the whirring
of this machine,

656
00:34:47,561 --> 00:34:49,737
mechanical, deafening.

657
00:34:51,693 --> 00:34:54,934
Something went wrong
with the procedure.

658
00:34:57,221 --> 00:34:59,223
There was so much blood, Max.

659
00:35:04,006 --> 00:35:06,317
They tried to remove me,
but Patty wouldn't let them,

660
00:35:06,449 --> 00:35:08,207
wouldn't let go of my hand.

661
00:35:09,362 --> 00:35:11,975
So I held on
with everything I had.

662
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,348
We both held on.

663
00:35:24,587 --> 00:35:27,528
After that,
I got into the fight.

664
00:35:29,509 --> 00:35:32,557
I went to every march,
every protest.

665
00:35:32,822 --> 00:35:36,958
Sneak out of my classes,
grab my homemade signs, and go.

666
00:35:38,153 --> 00:35:40,317
We fought and fought,

667
00:35:40,402 --> 00:35:44,465
and in 1973, we won.

668
00:35:52,329 --> 00:35:56,550
I can't believe
we're back here again.

669
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:14,418
How is this the world
that Luna has to grow up in?

670
00:36:20,718 --> 00:36:23,121
I'm sorry, Max.

671
00:36:23,464 --> 00:36:25,253
I shouldn't have
asked you to fix this.

672
00:36:25,572 --> 00:36:27,238
It wasn't fair.

673
00:36:27,522 --> 00:36:29,092
It wasn't realistic.

674
00:36:29,184 --> 00:36:31,273
What can one person do?

675
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:43,113
<i>Phlebotomist,
room 319 for a draw.</i>

676
00:36:43,197 --> 00:36:44,550
<i>Phlebotomy, room 319.</i>

677
00:36:44,634 --> 00:36:46,433
Well, I know
the kind of day I had.

678
00:36:46,518 --> 00:36:48,204
So I can only imagine
the kind of day

679
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,778
the OB/GYN department had.

680
00:36:49,863 --> 00:36:52,076
I've definitely
seen better ones.

681
00:36:54,582 --> 00:36:56,972
I want to train to do a D and C.

682
00:37:03,775 --> 00:37:05,244
Sorry if that was
out of left field.

683
00:37:05,329 --> 00:37:06,464
I'm just trying
to figure out some...

684
00:37:06,549 --> 00:37:10,246
Max, that was the only
good thing to happen all day.

685
00:37:19,816 --> 00:37:21,777
You did the right thing today.

686
00:37:21,862 --> 00:37:24,472
I feel like such a loser.

687
00:37:24,791 --> 00:37:26,665
You are not a loser.

688
00:37:27,031 --> 00:37:28,859
You're a parent
in the real world.

689
00:37:36,707 --> 00:37:38,930
Hey, Samira?

690
00:37:39,061 --> 00:37:40,718
Honey?

691
00:37:40,803 --> 00:37:42,068
Hi.

692
00:37:42,386 --> 00:37:43,613
What's happening here?

693
00:37:43,698 --> 00:37:45,402
Why are you not packed for camp?

694
00:37:45,487 --> 00:37:47,347
I'm not gonna go.

695
00:37:48,714 --> 00:37:50,440
It's okay to be nervous,
sweetheart.

696
00:37:50,525 --> 00:37:51,621
It's totally normal.

697
00:37:51,706 --> 00:37:53,449
The camp is in South Dakota.

698
00:37:53,534 --> 00:37:56,016
The abortion ban
happened there today.

699
00:37:59,449 --> 00:38:00,845
I'm not a little kid anymore.

700
00:38:00,998 --> 00:38:03,135
I know what's happening
in the world.

701
00:38:03,227 --> 00:38:05,136
So I'm not going.

702
00:38:05,459 --> 00:38:06,693
You're not?

703
00:38:06,891 --> 00:38:09,986
I know it's small, and
maybe nobody will even notice,

704
00:38:10,071 --> 00:38:12,464
but it's all I could do.

705
00:38:14,138 --> 00:38:17,514
Honey, that is not small.

706
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,623
I see it.

707
00:38:20,121 --> 00:38:21,385
I notice.

708
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:23,115
I'm so proud of you.

And when they finally reached
the other side of the bridge,

724
00:39:15,213 --> 00:39:16,810
Gus bolted.

725
00:39:17,015 --> 00:39:19,106
He leapt
between a giraffe's legs,

726
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:24,857
over an elephant's trunk,
and galloped out of sight.

727
00:39:25,252 --> 00:39:27,208
Are you so sad?

728
00:39:27,775 --> 00:39:29,519
Yeah, baby.

729
00:39:29,705 --> 00:39:32,529
Sorry, I thought I could do
a better job hiding it.

730
00:39:34,424 --> 00:39:36,341
Why are you sad?

731
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:42,373
Well, because
a sad thing happened today.

732
00:39:42,458 --> 00:39:44,985
Not just to me, to everybody.

733
00:39:45,279 --> 00:39:47,872
And I guess it made daddy
a little sad,

734
00:39:47,957 --> 00:39:53,107
and a little mad,
and a little frustrated.

735
00:39:54,279 --> 00:39:56,677
- Do you know frustrated?
- Monkey bars.

736
00:39:56,762 --> 00:39:58,332
Yeah.

737
00:39:58,614 --> 00:40:00,179
Yeah, it's like
when you get frustrated,

738
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:01,716
and you can't climb
the monkey bars.

739
00:40:01,801 --> 00:40:03,083
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

740
00:40:03,221 --> 00:40:05,706
I got frustrated today
because I wanted to make

741
00:40:05,791 --> 00:40:07,112

for you.

744
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:17,787

00:40:19,271 --> 00:40:21,623

00:40:43,059 --> 00:40:47,011
Elephant...
Honey, daddy's a little tired.

754
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:49,548
I don't know if it's a good
night for an elephant ride...

755
00:40:49,633 --> 00:40:51,277
