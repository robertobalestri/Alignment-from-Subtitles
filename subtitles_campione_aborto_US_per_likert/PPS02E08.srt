00:08:42,305 --> 00:08:44,603
CHARLOTTE:
Sean, this is Dr. Montgomery.

167
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,571
She's an OB/neonatal specialist.

168
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:50,167
- Would you mind if she examined Alena?
- No. No, please.

169
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,174
Uh, Alena, she just moaned.

170
00:08:54,317 --> 00:08:55,807
That's good, right?

171
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,750
She hasn't done that
since right after the accident.

172
00:08:59,555 --> 00:09:02,115
Moaning is a good sign
that she's starting to respond?

173
00:09:02,258 --> 00:09:04,419
I think it's just a sign of labor.

174
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,791
Sean, the neurologist told you,
she's non-responsive.

175
00:09:08,097 --> 00:09:10,657
I'm so sorry for your loss.

176
00:09:12,068 --> 00:09:14,002
She wants this baby so much.

177
00:09:14,503 --> 00:09:18,439
We found out she was pregnant
the day before the car accident.

178
00:09:18,574 --> 00:09:21,509
I think it was the happiest day
of her life.

179
00:09:22,178 --> 00:09:24,442
Every day I sit here
and remind her about that day

180
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,514
so she has something good
to think about.

181
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:27,877
ADDISON:
Baby's in a breech position.

182
00:09:28,017 --> 00:09:31,282
- Our OB tried ECV to turn the baby, but...
ADDISON: She's down too low.

183
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,581
I need to do a C-section.
Wanna book an OR?

184
00:09:33,723 --> 00:09:34,883
SEAN:
No.

185
00:09:35,024 --> 00:09:37,925
She needs to go through labor.
She needs to deliver this baby herself.

186
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,288
Sean, she can't.

187
00:09:39,428 --> 00:09:42,397
The breech position
puts the baby at risk for a prolapsed cord,

188
00:09:42,531 --> 00:09:44,362
which would cut off
the baby's oxygen supply.

189
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,992
The head could get trapped,
potentially causing brain injury or worse.

190
00:09:48,137 --> 00:09:50,162
Yeah, woman in Kentucky,
situation just like Alena,

191
00:09:50,306 --> 00:09:52,240
having the baby, it woke her.

192
00:09:52,575 --> 00:09:56,477
Alena needs to deliver this baby naturally,
on her own.

193
00:09:56,612 --> 00:09:57,977
She has to,

194
00:09:58,481 --> 00:10:00,711
or I am never gonna get her back.

195
00:10:01,384 --> 00:10:04,114
Alena is going to wake up.

196
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,382
And we're gonna be a family again.

197
00:10:19,602 --> 00:10:21,729
He's going to kill his own child.

198
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:25,068
He loves her. He's sat here every day.
He wants her back.

199
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,368
She's not waking up.
"Rip Van Winkle" is a fairy tale.

200
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:31,310
- Don't tell me you're going sentimental.
- Hardly. Just...

201
00:10:31,447 --> 00:10:32,573
I find him touching.

202
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,684
Great. You wanna comfort him
when he loses them both?

203
00:10:36,352 --> 00:10:38,445
There's really nothing you can do
to help her deliver naturally?

204
00:10:38,587 --> 00:10:41,920
No, and even if she could, the chances
of her coming out of that coma are...

205
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,253
- Almost none.
- I need to do a C-section.

206
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:47,260
I need to get the baby out now,
or both mom and baby could die.

207
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:50,092
We can't make him.
We can't force him to let us cut her open.

208
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,358
Look, maybe if you talk to him,
get to know him.

209
00:10:54,503 --> 00:10:56,562
He warms up to you,
and you help him understand...

210
00:10:56,706 --> 00:10:58,697
No, that's your job, Charlotte,
as chief of staff.

211
00:10:58,841 --> 00:11:00,832
My job, as consult,
is to get the baby out.

212
00:11:00,976 --> 00:11:03,069
- I have a practice to get back to.
- So do I.

213
00:11:07,216 --> 00:11:10,777
We have to work together
to help that family.

214
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,410
Yes, we do.

215
00:11:12,555 --> 00:11:14,648
I'll put her on terbutaline
to stop the contractions,

216
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,451
but that'll only get you through the day.

217
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:17,650
I'll consult Legal,

218
00:11:17,793 --> 00:11:20,956
see if there's any way we can override
the father and do the C without consent.

219
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,724
Okay.

220
00:11:23,032 --> 00:11:24,897
Okay.

221
00:11:27,036 --> 00:11:29,527
VIOLET: She was dying.
She had Wegener's Disease.

222
00:11:29,672 --> 00:11:31,902
She was dying,
but the pain was under control.

223
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,032
You know as well as I do
that can fluctuate.

224
00:11:34,176 --> 00:11:36,872
I know that he hated her.
And I know that from you.

225
00:11:37,012 --> 00:11:39,276
Then you also know that
he chose to stay in the marriage.

226
00:11:39,415 --> 00:11:42,145
He could've left, and he didn't.
Why now?

227
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:46,015
She was gonna die in, what, six weeks?
Three months?

228
00:11:46,155 --> 00:11:49,386
You think after years and years and years
of this marriage,

229
00:11:49,525 --> 00:11:50,890
he would shoot her now?

230
00:11:51,026 --> 00:11:53,221
They had a volatile relationship.
All right?

231
00:11:53,362 --> 00:11:57,662
Now, you may have seen his side,
but I saw hers, and she...

232
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,926
She was not suicidal.

233
00:11:59,068 --> 00:12:01,866
- Well, Doug was not homicidal.
- Except for the gun in his hand.

234
00:12:02,872 --> 00:12:04,499
- I don't think it was like that.
- Well,

235
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,699
the cops are gonna want a statement
from both of us.

236
00:12:06,842 --> 00:12:10,278
And I'm gonna tell the truth.

237
00:12:10,413 --> 00:12:13,746
Well, if Doug gives me permission
to talk to them, so am I.

238
00:12:14,517 --> 00:12:17,486
The actual truth,
or the truth that you wanna believe?

239
00:12:22,925 --> 00:12:28,591
NAOMl: No. No. It's...
No, it's fantastic. I'm serious.

240
00:12:28,731 --> 00:12:31,564
- What's going on?
- I like her, Pete.

241
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,497
I went down
to the Venice Family Clinic today

242
00:12:33,636 --> 00:12:34,864
to offer my services.

243
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:38,269
Turns out they have a huge overflow
of patients, but not enough exam rooms.

244
00:12:38,407 --> 00:12:40,534
But with Naomi's help,
we found some room here.

245
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:45,704
- Here? At Oceanside Wellness?
- When the clinic has too many patients,

246
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,180
- I'll see them here.
- Addison's always talking about how,

247
00:12:48,317 --> 00:12:49,682
with Charlotte's practice opening,

248
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:52,549
we need to expand our
community outreach and raise our profile.

249
00:12:52,922 --> 00:12:57,052
Meg is the perfect liaison.
Plus, she's willing to let Dell shadow.

250
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,661
Oceanside Wellness
gets to generate possible future income,

251
00:12:59,795 --> 00:13:01,990
and I get to avoid going stir-crazy.
Everyone wins.

252
00:13:02,131 --> 00:13:03,564
Yay.

253
00:13:04,233 --> 00:13:05,598
What?

254
00:13:05,734 --> 00:13:07,395
Nothing.
It's great. You'll be great here.

255
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:10,437
- Welcome aboard, Meg.
- Thank you.

256
00:13:12,608 --> 00:13:14,303
You have the face.

257
00:13:14,443 --> 00:13:17,207
- I don't have the face.
- You told me to find an opportunity.

258
00:13:17,346 --> 00:13:20,008
I did. Welcome aboard.

259
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:24,814
All right, I have to go find Dell
and get set up.

260
00:13:24,954 --> 00:13:26,717
- See you later?
- Yeah.

261
00:13:35,698 --> 00:13:37,359
Sorry.

262
00:13:42,538 --> 00:13:44,403
Is it always this slow?

263
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,906
Only when someone stops it.

264
00:13:53,616 --> 00:13:54,776
We're not moving, are we?

265
00:13:55,818 --> 00:13:57,513
No, we're not.

266
00:14:00,022 --> 00:14:01,990
Are you okay?
You're not claustrophobic, are you?

267
00:14:02,124 --> 00:14:05,116
No, just impatient and in a bad mood.

268
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,319
Anything I can do?

269
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,063
It's an occupational hazard.

270
00:14:12,201 --> 00:14:13,463
I'm a therapist.

271
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,536
And to be honest, I'm a bit nervous.

272
00:14:15,671 --> 00:14:18,367
Interviewing for a new job,
you know, so...

273
00:14:18,507 --> 00:14:20,771
- On the fourth floor?
- Yes. You work there?

274
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:24,275
- Uh, no. I pushed 5, remember?
- Right.

275
00:14:25,681 --> 00:14:28,149
- Well, if you need to talk, if there's...
- I'm a shrink too.

276
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,444
I think I can handle it.

277
00:14:32,821 --> 00:14:35,221
Oh, I'm Sh...

278
00:14:35,658 --> 00:14:36,784
I'm Sheldon Wallace.

279
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,418
Have a nice day.

280
00:14:44,266 --> 00:14:46,359
This is all yours for the day.

281
00:14:47,102 --> 00:14:49,662
- Is there anything else you need?
- No, this is perfect.

282
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:50,863
Better than I'm used to.

283
00:14:51,006 --> 00:14:53,736
Can I just say, Dr. Porter, that
I'm very excited to be working with you.

284
00:14:53,876 --> 00:14:55,503
- Meg, please.
- Meg. L...

285
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:58,545
I was blown away by the work you did
for the women of the Fulani tribe.

286
00:14:58,681 --> 00:14:59,739
I read an article on it.

287
00:14:59,882 --> 00:15:01,543
I just know I'm gonna learn so much
working with you.

288
00:15:01,684 --> 00:15:03,379
Well, I bet you could teach me
a few things too.

289
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,487
- I'm just starting.
- Well, here at Oceanside,

290
00:15:05,621 --> 00:15:08,522
I'm just starting too.
I need someone to clue me in.

291
00:15:09,224 --> 00:15:12,955
- Candy stash under the microwave.
- See? That's critical information.

292
00:15:13,362 --> 00:15:16,160
Well, Dell, it looks like
our first patient together is Renee Olsen.

293
00:15:16,298 --> 00:15:18,027
Okay.

294
00:15:21,804 --> 00:15:23,669
- Renee Olsen?
- Yes.

295
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,602
Hi.

296
00:15:25,741 --> 00:15:27,641
- I'm Dell Parker.
- Hi.

297
00:15:27,776 --> 00:15:32,679
Um, I was referred to Dr. Porter
for, um, termination.

298
00:15:33,048 --> 00:15:34,483
- I'm sorry?
- Termination.

299
00:15:34,483 --> 00:15:35,245
- I'm sorry?
- Termination.

300
00:15:35,417 --> 00:15:36,645
Abortion?

301
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:40,549
Oh, no, there must be some mistake.
We don't do those here.

302
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:44,625
Um, but they said... I wrote it down.
- Dr. Meg Porter

303
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,991
for abortion services,
Oceanside Wellness Group.

304
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:49,154
Am I in the right place?

305
00:15:51,066 --> 00:15:53,296
It's not like I don't want her here.
I just don't...

306
00:15:53,435 --> 00:15:55,733
- Want her here.
- She just did it. She didn't ask me.

307
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:56,963
Welcome to my world.

308
00:15:57,106 --> 00:15:59,836
I guess it's better than her
going and getting a job with Charlotte.

309
00:15:59,975 --> 00:16:02,842
When you're working with somebody
that you love you gotta be respectful.

310
00:16:02,978 --> 00:16:04,309
You gotta communicate.

311
00:16:04,446 --> 00:16:06,812
That worked so well for you and Naomi
you got divorced?

312
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:08,473
It's not like she went behind my back.

313
00:16:08,617 --> 00:16:09,982
- She...
- Went behind your back.

314
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:11,746
- Stop finishing my sentences.
SAM: Okay.

315
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,912
You know, she's a good doctor.
She's gonna be fine.

316
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,616
Hey, did anybody know
Meg was gonna be doing abortions?

317
00:16:17,092 --> 00:16:19,083
- No.
DELL: I know I'm not a partner,

318
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,163
and you might be okay with this.
I wanna go on the record saying I'm not.

319
00:16:22,297 --> 00:16:24,231
- Not okay with what?
- Meg working here.

320
00:16:24,366 --> 00:16:27,096
Oh, yeah. Nai told me.
Pro bono clinic, I think it's great.

321
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,101
- She's doing abortions.
- And?

322
00:16:31,273 --> 00:16:33,298
Oh, wait,
you men have a problem with it?

323
00:16:33,442 --> 00:16:34,909
No, not as men.

324
00:16:35,044 --> 00:16:36,739
- We respect the choice, but...
- I don't.

325
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:38,574
Um, I'm not commenting.

326
00:16:38,714 --> 00:16:40,545
- We just didn't know.
NAOMl: You didn't know what?

327
00:16:40,683 --> 00:16:42,981
- Meg's doing abortions here.
- She's what?

328
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:45,183
If only because of the way
this practice is set up...

329

00:26:06,781 --> 00:26:12,048
Well, I fertilize eggs every day,
and I believe that life begins at conception.

- So, what, it's murder?
- I believe what I believe.

495

- Well, you don't do what I do.

you might be in the mood for a drink

500

I'm sorry.

Whatever you want. I'll do the time.

Just go home.

510
00:27:47,182 --> 00:27:50,982
I needed time to think.

511
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:52,950
So I thought in my hotel room

512
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:56,785
with the crisp white sheets
and the travel-size toiletries.

513
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,359
- You didn't have to do that.
- I need to know what this is.

What we're doing here, because when
I'm in your bed, everything's fine.

515
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:06,329
But at your office, I was the enemy.

516

- You're not the enemy.
- You have two modes.

517

Off and on.

518
00:28:10,572 --> 00:28:14,372
And when you're off, Peter,
you get cold.

519

You're closed, you're shut down.

520
00:28:16,378 --> 00:28:18,580
It's like you're punishing me
for something that I didn't do.

521
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,979
It's like you're punishing me
for something that I didn't do.

522
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,776
You never used to be like this.

523
00:28:21,916 --> 00:28:23,747
The man I knew...

524
00:28:23,885 --> 00:28:26,479
We used to share everything.

525
00:28:29,257 --> 00:28:30,383
So, what happened?

00:28:30,725 --> 00:28:33,353
What happened to you

What you do for people is good.

528
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,126

00:28:49,077 --> 00:28:50,408
You're not the enemy.

Good morning.

532
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:06,023
So the district attorney's gonna
subpoena Karen's medical records.

00:29:07,762 --> 00:29:09,320
Great.

Doug acted out of mercy. You treated him.

You're vested in how he behaves,
but sometimes even the best therapists

can't stop somebody
from going down the wrong road.

00:29:31,052 --> 00:29:34,283
Hey. You are a great therapist.

539
00:29:35,924 --> 00:29:39,325
If Doug had listened to your advice
and gotten out of that marriage,

540
00:29:39,461 --> 00:29:41,361
we wouldn't be in this situation.

- Good morning.
- Not so good.

543

- Are you okay?
- I was up all night trying to figure this out.

544

I cannot get the image of Doug
with that gun in his hand out of my head.

- So then you do think it's possible that...?
- No.

Oh, please, bother me.

00:30:47,195 --> 00:30:50,255
So Doug Adams killed his wife.

560
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:52,832
You probably don't have a lot of patients
who've done that.

561
00:30:52,967 --> 00:30:55,731
- I deal with murderers every day.
- Well, that's the thing.

How do I know if it's murder
or assisted suicide?

563
00:30:58,673 --> 00:31:02,769
Doug has had no difficulty with impulsivity
or anger control his entire life.

564
00:31:02,911 --> 00:31:05,141
He was submissive to his wife.

565
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:09,239
I've never found any indication
that he was remotely violent.

566
00:31:09,384 --> 00:31:12,820
In fact, I would be hard-pressed
to concoct a scenario

in which he had the temerity
to strike out against his wife,

unless she instructed him.

569
00:31:17,859 --> 00:31:19,986
- So they didn't have a good marriage?
- He could have divorced her.

570
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,494
We talked about it. He chose to stay
to take care of her.

571
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:25,724
You don't think he got scared to leave
and took the easy way out?

572
00:31:25,867 --> 00:31:29,303
Killing Karen
would never be the easy way out for him.

00:36:14,689 --> 00:36:17,749
I guarantee you she was already worried
about people out there judging her,

662
00:36:17,892 --> 00:36:19,723
only to have you
make her feel ashamed.

663
00:36:19,861 --> 00:36:21,886
But we are medical professionals.

664
00:36:22,029 --> 00:36:23,826
It is part of our job to support her

665
00:36:23,965 --> 00:36:26,695

the hardest choice imaginable.

666
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:40,843
- You're not allowed down here, Sean.
- I know. Look, I just... I can't...

667
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:44,340
I made her laugh.

668
00:36:44,485 --> 00:36:47,545
I made her laugh,
and she looked away from the road, and...

669
00:36:50,024 --> 00:36:52,686
I caused it.
I was responsible for her coma.

670
00:36:52,827 --> 00:36:55,955
I don't wanna be responsible
for her staying like this.

671
00:36:56,097 --> 00:36:58,224
Please. I know what the judge said.

672
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,225
But...

673
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:03,695
I need a miracle here.

674
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:06,764
I'm asking for a miracle.

675
00:37:06,908 --> 00:37:09,706
You were not responsible for this.
This is out of your hands.

676
00:37:09,844 --> 00:37:12,642
You have to stop punishing yourself.

677
00:37:12,947 --> 00:37:16,075
Sean, you didn't make
that accident happen,

678
00:37:16,217 --> 00:37:18,310
and you don't make miracles happen.

679
00:37:18,452 --> 00:37:19,714
But I do.

680
00:37:19,854 --> 00:37:23,255
I'm about to go in there
and deliver your miracle, Sean.

681
00:37:23,624 --> 00:37:26,718
And I know that this isn't the path
that you sought out,

682
00:37:26,861 --> 00:37:29,955
or the one that you and Alena
saw for yourselves.

683
00:37:30,097 --> 00:37:31,155
But this is your baby.

684
00:37:32,033 --> 00:37:33,159
The baby that Alena wanted,

685
00:37:33,301 --> 00:37:35,326
and the one
that she would want you to raise.

686
00:37:35,469 --> 00:37:39,462
So I'm gonna go in that OR,
and I'm gonna bring out that miracle.

687
00:37:53,387 --> 00:37:55,787
Did you talk to the DA? What'd he say?

688
00:37:56,223 --> 00:37:59,989
You know, I didn't talk to him yet.
I wanted to talk to you more.

689
00:38:01,228 --> 00:38:04,129
I was worried about you, here.

690
00:38:04,265 --> 00:38:08,201
Thinking about what you did,
what you had to do.

691
00:38:10,771 --> 00:38:12,204
It must've been awful.

692
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:16,699
- It was.
- To do that to someone you loved.

693
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:21,412
And to have her ask for that.

694
00:38:21,749 --> 00:38:23,614
For her to ask you to use a gun.

695
00:38:23,851 --> 00:38:25,910
She was just...

696
00:38:26,854 --> 00:38:29,652
She was in so much pain.
She wanted it to end.

697
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:31,587
But a gun?

698
00:38:31,759 --> 00:38:33,920
Karen wanted it to be quick.

699
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:37,963
She was afraid
that something else wouldn't work.

700
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,200
- She was just in so much pain, and...
- I know, I know.

701
00:38:42,336 --> 00:38:44,804
I know all about her pain, Doug.

702
00:38:45,339 --> 00:38:46,465

Yeah, unapologetically.

Do you think it makes a difference why
a woman would want to have an abortion?

710
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:17,737
- Like rape or...
- I think it matters why it bothers you.

- Well, if you're against it

that's one thing.

I refused to even learn
how to perform the procedure

in medical school. I couldn't. I just...

716
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,052
I couldn't.

717
00:39:37,191 --> 00:39:40,422

Did your child's mother?

721
00:39:51,572 --> 00:39:54,700
Uh, did she consider
having an abortion?

722
00:39:58,712 --> 00:40:00,339
You tried to talk her into getting one.

723
00:40:04,185 --> 00:40:05,550
Yeah.

724
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,221
And now you look
into your daughter's beautiful face,

725
00:40:09,356 --> 00:40:10,448
and you feel guilty.

726
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:20,362
We went to the clinic,
and she wouldn't get out of the car.

727
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,526
And I yelled at her.

728
00:40:24,105 --> 00:40:27,905
I yelled at her.
And, you know, now I just...

729
00:40:29,877 --> 00:40:32,311
I just can't believe I yelled at her.

Then I think you are not against

It's hard to feel that way
when I'm in here.

She made you feel awful
every day of your life.

that by helping her,

the pain would go away.

00:41:40,047 --> 00:41:42,072
Just let it go.

750
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:46,481
She kept yelling at me.

751
00:41:47,154 --> 00:41:49,748
For me to do things for her.

752
00:41:51,292 --> 00:41:54,625
She would say things to hurt me.

753
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,890
She would lie in that bed
and throw things at me,

754
00:41:58,032 --> 00:42:00,398
and call me an idiot and a weakling,

755
00:42:00,534 --> 00:42:02,729
and tell me everything I was doing
was wrong,

756
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:06,271
when all I wanted to do was help her.

757
00:42:06,407 --> 00:42:09,035
And the more she would yell,
the more she would bleed.

758
00:42:09,176 --> 00:42:12,942
And there was blood everywhere.
And I couldn't take her.

759
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,344
And I couldn't take the blood, and...

760
00:42:15,482 --> 00:42:17,507
And I stopped feeling sorry for her.

761
00:42:17,651 --> 00:42:18,552
And all I thought about
was that I should have left her.

762
00:42:18,552 --> 00:42:20,213
And all I thought about
was that I should have left her.

763
00:42:20,354 --> 00:42:22,754
I couldn't leave her now.
I couldn't just walk out the door.

764
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:24,551
But I couldn't stay.

765
00:42:24,692 --> 00:42:29,095
I couldn't hear her yell anymore.

766
00:42:29,396 --> 00:42:31,387
I couldn't hear it.

767
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:34,430
So I took the gun,

768
00:42:35,102 --> 00:42:37,229

00:48:15,909 --> 00:48:17,240
Did anyone get hurt?

833
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:19,502
Yes.

834
00:48:19,913 --> 00:48:22,973
So you have your answer, don't you?

835
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:29,880
I'm...

836
00:48:30,023 --> 00:48:31,820
I'm Violet.

837
00:48:32,359 --> 00:48:33,917
Violet Turner.

838
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,101
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

839
00:48:45,772 --> 00:48:48,764
You asked what happened to me
between then and now.

840
00:48:53,146 --> 00:48:56,479
I have a dead wife that I hated.

841
00:48:57,584 --> 00:48:59,108
Hated.

842
00:48:59,252 --> 00:49:01,447
Until the moment she was gone.

843
00:49:03,223 --> 00:49:05,987
And if I could

844
00:49:07,227 --> 00:49:11,129
take back the hate...

845
00:49:14,568 --> 00:49:15,592
But I can't.

846
00:49:16,837 --> 00:49:19,499
And it killed a piece of me.

847
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:24,772
There is a piece of me
that no longer exists because of her.

848
00:49:24,911 --> 00:49:28,244
- So when you feel threatened...?
- There are very few women that I trust.

849
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:32,375
You trust the women here.
Naomi, Violet, Addison.

850
00:49:32,519 --> 00:49:34,419
- They're family.
- And I'm not?

851
00:49:38,125 --> 00:49:40,184
I'm trying, Meg.

852
00:49:41,595 --> 00:49:43,460
I'm doing the best I can, okay?

853
00:49:44,364 --> 00:49:45,956
Okay.

854
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:52,168
He's going to prison
for a very, very, very long time.

855
00:49:52,305 --> 00:49:53,636
Yeah.

856
00:49:53,774 --> 00:49:55,605
Poor Karen.

857
00:49:56,643 --> 00:49:59,840
I feel so guilty
that I ever believed in him.

858
00:50:00,881 --> 00:50:03,475
Are you at all religious?

859
00:50:04,184 --> 00:50:05,811
No.

860
00:50:05,952 --> 00:50:07,419
Well,

861
00:50:07,988 --> 00:50:09,888
in church,

862
00:50:10,524 --> 00:50:12,116
when someone dies,

863
00:50:14,728 --> 00:50:18,789
we light a candle to remember them.

864
00:50:40,053 --> 00:50:41,179
What are we doing?

865
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,485
Trying to forgive ourselves.

866
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:50,323
Can I get in on that?

867
00:51:22,763 --> 00:51:25,061
A baby died today.

868
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:48,219
Hey, you.

869
00:51:51,057 --> 00:51:52,854
Long day?

870
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:55,354
Let me make you something to eat.
You must be starving.

871
00:51:55,495 --> 00:51:57,725
Addison, you took care of me.

872
00:51:58,598 --> 00:52:00,657
Now let me take care of you.

873
00:52:08,308 --> 00:52:10,208
I'm fine.

874
00:52:13,446 --> 00:52:16,006
I made a miracle today.

875
00:52:18,852 --> 00:52:20,945
I'm fine.

876
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:26,256
I'm fine.
