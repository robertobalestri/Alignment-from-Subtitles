1
00:00:13,709 --> 00:00:15,450
Whoa.

2
00:00:15,493 --> 00:00:18,844
I don't think I've seen
the ED this quiet since...

3
00:00:18,888 --> 00:00:21,064
I don't think I've ever seen
the ED this quiet.

4
00:00:21,108 --> 00:00:22,370
- Could be the new moon.

5
00:00:22,413 --> 00:00:24,763
- Or because NYU's
on spring break.

6
00:00:24,807 --> 00:00:26,591
- I'd say I hope it stays
like this for you,

7
00:00:26,635 --> 00:00:28,158
but I know you're a masochist.

8
00:00:28,202 --> 00:00:31,074
- Uh, no, not anymore.
I've changed.

9
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:33,120
- Mm.

10
00:01:33,745 --> 00:01:35,356
- Incoming!

11
00:01:37,575 --> 00:01:40,578
32-year-old woman,
restrained passenger in MVA.

12
00:01:40,622 --> 00:01:41,927
A van hit an embankment.

13
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:44,147
02 sats in the 80s
and dropping.

14
00:01:44,191 --> 00:01:45,235
- Okay, she may need
to be tubed.

15
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:46,280
I'll get an airway box.

16
00:01:46,323 --> 00:01:48,238
Casey,
draw up etomidate and sux.

17
00:01:48,282 --> 00:01:51,285
- We got this.
One, two, three.

18
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:56,420
- Okay,
let's bag her with 100% O-2.

19
00:01:56,464 --> 00:01:57,682
- Looks like
a class two airway.

20
00:01:57,726 --> 00:01:58,814
- Incoming!

21
00:01:58,857 --> 00:02:00,859
- Okay,
use a rapid sequence technique.

22
00:02:00,903 --> 00:02:02,209
Casey, when you finish,

23
00:02:02,252 --> 00:02:03,862
get a 12 lead EKG
and a stat portable chest.

24
00:02:03,906 --> 00:02:05,473
- You got it.

25
00:02:05,516 --> 00:02:07,388
- Restrained passenger in MVA.
- Man, I was good and asleep

26
00:02:07,431 --> 00:02:09,607
and then all of a sudden, boom!

27
00:02:09,651 --> 00:02:12,915
Glass was flying everywhere
and whatnot.

28
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:14,351
- Let's get her to bay 27.
- God bless...

29
00:02:14,395 --> 00:02:17,180
just trying to get
an early start

30
00:02:17,224 --> 00:02:18,529
back home to Alabama.

31
00:02:18,573 --> 00:02:19,617
- Okay, ma'am.

32
00:02:19,661 --> 00:02:20,792
- We were at this
church convention.

33
00:02:20,836 --> 00:02:22,925
- Ma'am.
- Oh, no, excuse me.

34
00:02:22,968 --> 00:02:24,274
- Ma'am.
- I am not a ma'am.

35
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:26,842
I am a Miss.
Miss Verdene.

36
00:02:26,885 --> 00:02:28,670
- Miss Verdene, well,
I am Dr. Bloom,

37
00:02:28,713 --> 00:02:29,975
and this here is
Nurse Brunstetter.

38
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:31,803
And they're gonna take care
of your lacerations.

39
00:02:31,847 --> 00:02:32,804
- Okay, thank you.

40
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:34,458
- Okay, let's expose the skin,

41
00:02:34,502 --> 00:02:36,373
irrigate the wounds,
and set up a suture tray.

42
00:02:36,417 --> 00:02:37,853
- Yeah.

43
00:02:37,896 --> 00:02:39,594
- This is Kaye Henry,
restrained driver of the van.

44
00:02:39,637 --> 00:02:41,335
Airbag deployed resulting
in chemical burns

45
00:02:41,378 --> 00:02:42,771
and a bleeding nose.

46
00:02:42,814 --> 00:02:44,947
- We're from Holy Gethsemane
Christian Fellowship.

47
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,862
Everybody from our group
has insurance.

48
00:02:46,905 --> 00:02:48,559
- That's okay.
- No, we can pay.

49
00:02:48,603 --> 00:02:50,822
- Well, today, I am fixing
broken noses for free.

50
00:02:50,866 --> 00:02:52,084
Bay 24.

51
00:02:52,128 --> 00:02:54,261
- 40-year-old woman
in respiratory arrest.

52
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:55,784
- Seriously?
Let me guess.

53
00:02:55,827 --> 00:02:57,394
Restrained passenger in MVA.

54
00:02:57,438 --> 00:02:59,527
- Please, somebody help her!

55
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:01,833
Can someone please help
with her leg?

56
00:03:01,877 --> 00:03:04,227
Please, please, someone.

57
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:05,533
Please, please,
don't let her die.

58
00:03:05,576 --> 00:03:07,752
Mariana?
Mariana, bay 26.

59
00:03:07,796 --> 00:03:09,624
Pneumothorax,
let's place a chest tube.

60
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:12,496
- Someone, please, please,
help her.

61
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,455
Please don't let her die.
Lottie's got babies at home.

62
00:03:14,498 --> 00:03:15,891
- All right.
All right.

63
00:03:15,934 --> 00:03:17,240
- Why's it so hard?
- Okay, ladies, I need for you

64
00:03:17,284 --> 00:03:18,850
both to breathe for me, okay?

65
00:03:20,896 --> 00:03:23,507
- Turan, compartment syndrome.

66
00:03:23,551 --> 00:03:26,858
Measure lower right extremity
for anterior pressure.

67
00:03:26,902 --> 00:03:29,034
- I'm not getting a good seal.

68
00:03:29,078 --> 00:03:31,036
- Mariana,
angle the tube posteriorly

69
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,429
for better blood evacuation.

70
00:03:32,473 --> 00:03:33,604
- Yes.

71
00:03:33,648 --> 00:03:34,866
- Okay, Nurse Jackson.
- I'm right here.

72
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,259
- Nurse Jackson,
let's get this going.

73
00:03:36,303 --> 00:03:37,391
Where's my cane?

74
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:38,914
All right, how you feeling,
Kaye?

75
00:03:38,957 --> 00:03:39,958
- Okay.
- Good?

76
00:03:40,002 --> 00:03:40,959
- Yeah.

77
00:03:41,003 --> 00:03:41,960
- Okay,
keep that--that's right.

78
00:03:42,004 --> 00:03:43,005
That's right.

79
00:03:43,048 --> 00:03:44,398
- Chest pressure's equalizing.

80
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:46,574
- Great.
- Bloom, leg pressure's 40.

81
00:03:46,617 --> 00:03:48,793
- Okay, do a fasciotomy
using the two incision

82
00:03:48,837 --> 00:03:49,881
four compartment technique.

83
00:03:49,925 --> 00:03:51,622
I need my cane.
- Ow, it hurts.

84
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,015
- All right, Kaye.

85
00:03:53,058 --> 00:03:54,799
First time you've broken
a bone?

86
00:03:54,843 --> 00:03:56,366
- Yeah.
- All right.

87
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,716
- This is gonna hurt,
hopefully not too much.

88
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,717
- Okay.

89
00:03:59,761 --> 00:04:01,980
- Auntie Kaye.
- Chante!

90
00:04:02,024 --> 00:04:03,373
That's my niece.
- Kaye.

91
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:04,374
You need to relax.
- I need to get to her.

92
00:04:04,418 --> 00:04:05,723
- Auntie Kaye, where are you?

93
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:06,942
- Restrained passenger
in the MVA.

94
00:04:06,985 --> 00:04:08,900
She has chest bruising
from the seatbelt.

95
00:04:08,944 --> 00:04:10,685
- My chest really hurts.

96
00:04:10,728 --> 00:04:12,034
- Okay, we're gonna take a look
at that.

97
00:04:12,077 --> 00:04:13,905
Let's move Chante to a side bay

98
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:16,038
and get chest x-rays,
both PA and lateral.

99
00:04:16,081 --> 00:04:17,300
- Okay.

100
00:04:17,344 --> 00:04:18,432
- She's been sick
the last few days.

101
00:04:18,475 --> 00:04:20,303
Nausea, vomiting.
- Kaye, I got her.

102
00:04:20,347 --> 00:04:21,739
I promise.

103
00:04:21,783 --> 00:04:22,784
The best way for you
to take care of her right now

104
00:04:22,827 --> 00:04:24,046
is to take care of yourself.

105
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:25,917
All right?
You need to rest.

106
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:28,311
- Alfreeda Watson,
54-year-old...

107
00:04:28,355 --> 00:04:29,617
Restrained passenger
in MVA.

108
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,879
- Got it.
- Her leg was trapped

109
00:04:30,922 --> 00:04:32,228
under the seat in front of her.

110
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,535
- Okay, Ms. Watson,
does your--does your leg hurt?

111
00:04:34,578 --> 00:04:35,797
- Well, it ain't childbirth,

112
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,929
but I 'spose it does
ache a touch.

113
00:04:37,973 --> 00:04:39,366
Now, I'm not one to complain,

114
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:41,498
but I think that New York is
tired of all us ladies

115
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:42,630
here from Alabama.

116
00:04:42,673 --> 00:04:43,805
- Uh, bay 28.

117
00:04:43,848 --> 00:04:46,721
Let's get some x-rays
and page Kapoor.

118
00:04:46,764 --> 00:04:47,939
Looks like nerve damage.
- Dr. Bloom?

119
00:04:47,983 --> 00:04:49,027
Dr. Bloom.
- Yes?

120
00:04:49,071 --> 00:04:50,246
Yes?

121
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:54,468
- Your nurse cut
my blouse--brand new blouse

122
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:55,599
clean off of me.

123
00:04:55,643 --> 00:04:57,035
- And I've apologized
several times.

124
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:58,994
- Okay, Miss Verdene--
- It was a final call sale.

125
00:04:59,037 --> 00:05:01,605
Now, what are they gonna do
about that?

126
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:02,911
They're stitching up my face.

127
00:05:02,954 --> 00:05:04,042
They're gonna stitch up
my shirt.

128
00:05:04,086 --> 00:05:05,348
- Uh, Brunstetter,
what have you got?

129
00:05:05,392 --> 00:05:07,132
- Sister Mary Joseph node.

130
00:05:07,176 --> 00:05:08,786
- Good find.
Okay, let's page Sharpe.

131
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,353
- Bloom,
pressure's bottoming out!

132
00:05:10,397 --> 00:05:11,485
- I'm gonna be right back.
- What?

133
00:05:11,528 --> 00:05:13,400
- Someone, I need my cane.

134
00:05:13,443 --> 00:05:15,402
- Restrained passenger,
hit her head during an MVA.

135
00:05:15,445 --> 00:05:16,968
- And this fool done put
an ice pack on it.

136
00:05:17,012 --> 00:05:18,970
- You're in pain.
- But the damn thing leaked.

137
00:05:19,014 --> 00:05:20,885
It's full of all kinds
of fake-ass chemicals.

138
00:05:20,929 --> 00:05:22,191
- Okay,
we're gonna irrigate your head,

139
00:05:22,234 --> 00:05:23,540
make sure all the chemicals
are washed away.

140
00:05:23,584 --> 00:05:24,889
- Irrigate?
Oh, no, ma'am.

141
00:05:24,933 --> 00:05:26,543
This is not wet and wild hair.
- Brunstetter!

142
00:05:26,587 --> 00:05:27,805
- Okay, this is
Nurse Brunstetter,

143
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:28,850
and they're gonna take
great care of you.

144
00:05:28,893 --> 00:05:29,851
- Bloom.
- Ooh.

145
00:05:29,894 --> 00:05:31,113
I can't wait
to get back home.

146
00:05:31,156 --> 00:05:32,375
- Take a look at this.

147
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:34,812
She's hemodynamically unstable.

148
00:05:34,856 --> 00:05:36,814
- SVT.
We need to cardiovert her.

149
00:05:36,858 --> 00:05:38,381
Come on.

150
00:05:38,425 --> 00:05:41,123
- She's in defib.
Charged.

151
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,646
- Clear.

152
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,866
- Go again,
increase to 150 joules.

153
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:46,128
- Charged.
- Clear.

154
00:05:47,695 --> 00:05:50,480
- We have sinus rhythm.
- Back to normal rhythm.

155
00:05:50,524 --> 00:05:52,830
- Blood pressure's rising.

156
00:05:52,874 --> 00:05:55,006
- All right,
vitals are stabilizing.

157
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,487
- Casey, pull up the portable
chest X-ray that you did.

158
00:06:00,534 --> 00:06:01,970
- What are you thinking?

159
00:06:02,013 --> 00:06:04,755
- EKG is showing low voltage
in the lateral leads.

160
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,193
Cardiac tamponade,
probably from that right there

161
00:06:08,237 --> 00:06:09,194
on the chest X-ray.

162
00:06:09,238 --> 00:06:10,805
- What?
- There's a shadow.

163
00:06:10,848 --> 00:06:11,936
- Contusion?

164
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,503
- It's more like a mass.

165
00:06:13,547 --> 00:06:14,983
Let's put Zoll Padz
on her chest

166
00:06:15,026 --> 00:06:16,637
to shock her heart
back to a regular rhythm

167
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,856
next time it goes off
and page Reynolds.

168
00:07:06,948 --> 00:07:08,906
- If one were more
conspiratorially minded,

169
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:11,474
one might think that you were
actually trying to avoid me.

170
00:07:11,518 --> 00:07:13,389
Uh-uh.

171
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,478
- Rough night?
- You could say that again.

172
00:07:15,522 --> 00:07:18,307
- Well, surely not because
of this adorable munchkin.

173
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:21,310
- Yeah, well, to her credit,
it does take commitment

174
00:07:21,353 --> 00:07:23,747
to sustain six straight hours
of screaming.

175
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,357
- Well, like her father,

176
00:07:25,401 --> 00:07:26,489
it would appear that
she's only content

177
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:27,534
inside a hospital.

178
00:07:27,577 --> 00:07:29,361
- Yeah, cruel, cruel irony.

179
00:07:29,405 --> 00:07:30,362
- Let me help.

180
00:07:30,406 --> 00:07:31,494
I mean, after work,

181
00:07:31,538 --> 00:07:32,669
I could take her
for a couple of hours,

182
00:07:32,713 --> 00:07:34,062
give you some me time.

183
00:07:34,105 --> 00:07:35,498
- That's very kind,
but I couldn't ask that of you.

184
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:36,847
- What if I insisted?

185
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:38,240
- Yeah, thanks anyways,

186
00:07:38,283 --> 00:07:39,676
but we kind of got
a whole system going.

187
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,592
So we're good...
for the most part.

188
00:07:46,727 --> 00:07:49,425
- You're right,
looks like a mass.

189
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,471
Well, based on the size,
she's had it for a while.

190
00:07:51,514 --> 00:07:52,907
Any of these women know
her health history?

191
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,865
- Not that I can figure out.
- Where'd you want me?

192
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:56,563
- Sister Mary Joseph node
in bay 29.

193
00:07:56,606 --> 00:07:57,738
- Let's take her up.

194
00:07:57,781 --> 00:07:59,609
- Dr. Bloom, point me.

195
00:07:59,653 --> 00:08:01,959
- Uh, bay 28, nerve damage.

196
00:08:03,744 --> 00:08:06,703
- Okay, Ms. Watson,
I'm Dr. Kapoor.

197
00:08:06,747 --> 00:08:09,445
I realize it might not
look this way now,

198
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,753
but you ladies really were
lucky,

199
00:08:12,796 --> 00:08:15,407
considering that there were
so many of you in the van.

200
00:08:15,451 --> 00:08:16,887
- So because I'm a black woman,
I must be

201
00:08:16,931 --> 00:08:19,368
with all the other black women
you got up in here?

202
00:08:20,543 --> 00:08:22,676
- No, that--not--that's not
what I...

203
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:23,894
what I meant was--

204
00:08:23,938 --> 00:08:26,418
- Relax, I'm with them.

205
00:08:26,462 --> 00:08:28,420
But you should see your face.

206
00:08:28,464 --> 00:08:29,813
It's like you caught
a spirit or something.

207
00:08:29,857 --> 00:08:31,685
- Is that a bad thing?

208
00:08:31,728 --> 00:08:33,600
- Depends on what you say
about my foot.

209
00:08:35,689 --> 00:08:38,039
- Well,
your foot is not broken,

210
00:08:38,082 --> 00:08:40,302
but the swelling is troubling.

211
00:08:40,345 --> 00:08:41,738
- Yeah, well,
that's nothing new.

212
00:08:41,782 --> 00:08:44,088
As long as I can walk
my fields, I'm fine enough.

213
00:08:44,132 --> 00:08:45,394
- You're a farmer?

214
00:08:45,437 --> 00:08:47,352
- Fourth generation, soybeans,

215
00:08:47,396 --> 00:08:49,093
when the foot isn't giving me
the blues.

216
00:08:49,137 --> 00:08:51,661
- Have you seen a doctor
about this?

217
00:08:51,705 --> 00:08:53,097
- You doctors want
so much out of pocket,

218
00:08:53,141 --> 00:08:54,795
and I make too much
for Medicaid.

219
00:08:54,838 --> 00:08:58,712
So I figure I just ride it out
until I qualify for Medicare.

220
00:08:58,755 --> 00:09:01,062
- Unfortunately, riding it out
is not an option.

221
00:09:01,105 --> 00:09:03,804
I need to ask a colleague
to evaluate it further.

222
00:09:03,847 --> 00:09:05,632
Have a good day.

223
00:09:11,463 --> 00:09:13,465
- I know you.
What's your name?

224
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:14,466
- Dr. Sharpe.

225
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,773
- No, no, that isn't it.

226
00:09:16,817 --> 00:09:17,992
Dr. Helen.

227
00:09:18,035 --> 00:09:20,516
You come on
after my stories sometimes.

228
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,952
Don't play.
- Okay, yes.

229
00:09:21,996 --> 00:09:24,781
I knew it, Dr. Helen.

230
00:09:24,825 --> 00:09:26,087
Fancy cancer doctor.

231
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,393
Oh, wait.

232
00:09:28,437 --> 00:09:30,352
Are you here
because I got cancer?

233
00:09:30,395 --> 00:09:31,745
- Verdene,
you don't have cancer.

234
00:09:31,788 --> 00:09:33,094
- Miss Verdene.

235
00:09:33,137 --> 00:09:35,139
- Miss Verdene,
you don't have cancer.

236
00:09:35,183 --> 00:09:36,967
- You gonna swear
on them chunky earrings

237
00:09:37,011 --> 00:09:38,360
you love wearing?

238
00:09:38,403 --> 00:09:40,405
- No, they're not that big,
are they?

239
00:09:42,712 --> 00:09:44,801
Miss Verdene, may I?

240
00:09:44,845 --> 00:09:47,412
This reddish lump...
- Mm-hmm.

241
00:09:47,456 --> 00:09:49,501
- Next to your belly button
is rather concerning.

242
00:09:49,545 --> 00:09:51,547
It indicates an infection
in your lymph nodes.

243
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,855
- So what's that mean?
Antibiotics, a cream?

244
00:09:54,898 --> 00:09:56,334
- I'm afraid it's not
that simple.

245
00:09:56,378 --> 00:09:57,988
The infection's being
complicated by your diabetes.

246
00:09:58,032 --> 00:10:01,818
- I got diabetes too?
Talk about buzzard luck.

247
00:10:01,862 --> 00:10:04,386
My father lost a foot to sugar.

248
00:10:04,429 --> 00:10:06,518
- When was your last checkup?

249
00:10:06,562 --> 00:10:09,652
- Well, they closed
the nearest hospital to me.

250
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:11,480
Take me at least an hour
to get to one.

251
00:10:11,523 --> 00:10:13,656
Now, who got time to drive
to two hours

252
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,051
round trip on top
of an appointment?

253
00:10:17,094 --> 00:10:19,444
- Hmm.

254
00:10:23,187 --> 00:10:25,668
Miss Verdene.

255
00:10:25,712 --> 00:10:27,583
I'm gonna go get my colleague
to come and see you.

256
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,889
- Why?

257
00:10:28,932 --> 00:10:30,455
- I think you just had
a seizure.

258
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:35,069
Vijay.
- Oh, good.

259
00:10:35,112 --> 00:10:37,898
I have a black female,
54, farmer, dry sense of humor,

260
00:10:37,941 --> 00:10:40,552
presenting asymptomatic
lower extremity edema.

261
00:10:40,596 --> 00:10:42,554
- Black female, 52,
restaurant worker,

262
00:10:42,598 --> 00:10:43,686
cutting fashion sense,

263
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,079
presenting
with petit mal seizures

264
00:10:45,122 --> 00:10:46,515
and untreated diabetes.

265
00:10:46,558 --> 00:10:49,126
- Okay.

266
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,998
- All right, I'm gonna need
a sternotomy tray,

267
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,869
a sternal saw,
and hand me the echo.

268
00:10:52,913 --> 00:10:56,960
- ♪ Feel discouraged

269
00:10:57,004 --> 00:10:58,832
- What is that?

270
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,529
- No idea what she's singing.

271
00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:01,878
- ♪ Should the shadows

272
00:11:01,922 --> 00:11:04,664
- She's induced,
spontaneous respiration.

273
00:11:05,926 --> 00:11:08,189
- ♪ Why should my heart

274
00:11:08,232 --> 00:11:10,713
- Forceps and chest tube,
pass it on the tray.

275
00:11:10,757 --> 00:11:12,628
- Turn up her meds.

276
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,805
- ♪ And long for heaven

277
00:11:15,849 --> 00:11:18,068
♪ And home

278
00:11:18,112 --> 00:11:20,157

00:11:20,201 --> 00:11:22,899
- You have those suture boots?
- Yeah, X-ray detectable.

280
00:11:22,943 --> 00:11:24,727
- Oh,
she was almost to the bridge.

281
00:11:26,381 --> 00:11:28,078
- You're interested in learning
to become a surgeon today,

282
00:11:28,122 --> 00:11:29,471
Dr. Duke?

283
00:11:29,514 --> 00:11:32,082
- She was singing--
- Get your head in the game.

284
00:11:32,126 --> 00:11:34,171
Ten blade, please.
Thank you.

285
00:11:34,215 --> 00:11:36,608
- We are ecstatic
to be considered

286
00:11:36,652 --> 00:11:37,697
as adoption candidates.

287
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,220
Believe me.

288
00:11:39,263 --> 00:11:41,570
It's just that to come
in--for us to in come tomorrow,

289
00:11:41,613 --> 00:11:43,224
I don't know my--um,

290
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:45,052
I don't know
my husband's schedule, really,

291
00:11:45,095 --> 00:11:46,749
and I don't wanna spring
anything on him--

292
00:11:46,793 --> 00:11:48,272
on his schedule, I mean.

293
00:11:51,014 --> 00:11:53,234
Oh, I see.

294
00:11:53,277 --> 00:11:54,844
I see.

295
00:11:54,888 --> 00:11:56,237
No.
No, no, no, no.

296
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,934
No, if tomorrow at 4:00 is
the only time you have,

297
00:11:57,978 --> 00:12:00,110
then we will make it work
on our end.

298
00:12:00,154 --> 00:12:02,591
Right.

299
00:12:02,634 --> 00:12:04,201
Yes, thank you.

300
00:12:04,245 --> 00:12:06,160
No, we look forward
to meeting you.

301
00:12:06,203 --> 00:12:07,770
Okay.

302
00:12:12,035 --> 00:12:14,298
Well done, Iggy.

303
00:12:14,342 --> 00:12:16,692
Hi, Chante,
I'm Doctor Frome.

304
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,780
I work here at the hospital.

305
00:12:17,824 --> 00:12:19,651
- Is it finally my X-ray time?

306
00:12:19,695 --> 00:12:23,264
- No, it is not
finally your X-ray time,

307
00:12:23,307 --> 00:12:26,093
because I have one
or two questions

308
00:12:26,136 --> 00:12:28,225
that I'd like to ask you first,
if that's okay with you.

309
00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:30,227
- Where's your white coat?

310
00:12:30,271 --> 00:12:32,708
- The white coat, um,
I don't know.

311
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,275
You know, I haven't worn
that thing in a long time,

312
00:12:34,318 --> 00:12:36,190
because I find that it makes
people feel more comfortable

313
00:12:36,233 --> 00:12:37,931
when I don't wear it.

314
00:12:37,974 --> 00:12:41,804
Plus, if I'm being honest,
I'm a super messy eater.

315
00:12:41,848 --> 00:12:43,327
So lame.

316
00:12:43,371 --> 00:12:44,764
- You're crazy.

317
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:46,287
- You're definitely not
the first person

318
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,288
to tell me that.

319
00:12:47,331 --> 00:12:48,768
- So when's the X-ray?

320
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:50,160
- Well, Chante,

321
00:12:50,204 --> 00:12:53,642
um, we can't give you an X-ray,

322
00:12:53,685 --> 00:12:55,775
because you are pregnant.

323
00:12:57,037 --> 00:12:59,082
We give a blood test to women
who don't know

324
00:12:59,126 --> 00:13:01,781
if they're pregnant
before we give them an X-ray.

325
00:13:03,173 --> 00:13:05,828
Because an X-ray can harm
the fetus.

326
00:13:07,177 --> 00:13:09,310
Do you understand what it means
to be pregnant?

327
00:13:09,353 --> 00:13:12,008
- I have a baby in me?

328
00:13:12,052 --> 00:13:13,793
Am I in trouble?

329
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:15,229
- No, you're not in trouble.

330
00:13:15,272 --> 00:13:16,839
No,
you're not in trouble at all.

331
00:13:16,883 --> 00:13:20,190
Um, did you know
that you were pregnant?

332
00:13:20,234 --> 00:13:23,106
- Maybe.
- Did you plan this?

333
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:29,156
Um, was the sex consensual?
Did you want to have sex?

334
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:31,593
- Who doesn't wanna have sex?

335
00:13:31,636 --> 00:13:34,291
I like sex.
Do you like sex?

336
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:37,686
- Do I like sex?
Um, sure.

337
00:13:37,729 --> 00:13:40,776
- Sex is great.
Wow.

338
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,865
Yeah, okay.

339
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:44,736
- Okay, yeah.
That's healthy.

340
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,390
There's nothing wrong
with liking sex.

341
00:13:46,434 --> 00:13:49,741
I just need to make sure
that nobody did anything to you

342
00:13:49,785 --> 00:13:51,265
that you didn't want.

343
00:13:51,308 --> 00:13:52,657
- I wanted to,

344
00:13:52,701 --> 00:13:54,224
and my boyfriend was
a scaredy-cat.

345
00:13:54,268 --> 00:13:55,747
He forgot the condom.

346
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:58,272
- Yeah,
condom's pretty important.

347
00:13:58,315 --> 00:13:59,795
Let me ask you this.

348
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,929
Do you have a plan
with your pregnancy?

349
00:14:04,365 --> 00:14:06,062
- I want an abortion.

350
00:14:09,109 --> 00:14:11,633
- Do you understand
what that means?

351
00:14:11,676 --> 00:14:14,854
- I don't wanna--I don't wanna
have a baby.

352
00:14:18,118 --> 00:14:20,337
- Sorry
for the impromptu music.

353
00:14:20,381 --> 00:14:22,078
My mom used to sing
"His Eye is on the Sparrow",

354
00:14:22,122 --> 00:14:23,601
like, every Sunday.

355
00:14:23,645 --> 00:14:26,996
Yeah, after church, it was
laundry, singing, and folding.

356
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,432
- Angle that light for me.

357
00:14:28,476 --> 00:14:31,131
- She was choir section leader
before she got sick.

358
00:14:31,174 --> 00:14:34,090
The altos, music, church,
it meant a lot to her.

359
00:14:34,134 --> 00:14:36,049
- Dr. Duke, I am fully aware
of the relationship

360
00:14:36,092 --> 00:14:37,920
between black women and church.

361
00:14:37,964 --> 00:14:39,661
They're everywhere
but the pulpit.

362
00:14:39,704 --> 00:14:41,358
My mom doesn't let me
miss a Sunday,

363
00:14:41,402 --> 00:14:42,925
but that's on Sunday.

364
00:14:42,969 --> 00:14:44,274
- Can I have
the cardioplegic solution

365
00:14:44,318 --> 00:14:45,972
sent down?

366
00:14:49,062 --> 00:14:51,368
- Ah, damn it.
- What's wrong?

367
00:14:51,412 --> 00:14:53,153
- The mass causing
the tamponade has grown

368
00:14:53,196 --> 00:14:54,284
through the chamber wall.

369
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:55,720
Where is the echo I asked for?

370
00:14:55,764 --> 00:14:57,026
- On its way
from Hastings' surgery.

371
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,375
- Get it here now.

372
00:14:58,419 --> 00:14:59,942
- Can you do a resection
to remove it?

373
00:14:59,986 --> 00:15:01,074
- The way it's positioned
posteriorly,

374
00:15:01,117 --> 00:15:02,814
I have to remove the heart
entirely

375
00:15:02,858 --> 00:15:03,946
and then resect the mass.

376
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,817
- And then put the heart
back in?

377
00:15:05,861 --> 00:15:08,472
- Prep the SCS bath
on the back table.

378
00:15:15,175 --> 00:15:17,307
Ms. Henry, I'm Dr. Goodwin.

379
00:15:17,351 --> 00:15:20,180
I just wanted you to know
that everyone in your group

380
00:15:20,223 --> 00:15:23,313
has stabilized except
for Tamala Robeson.

381
00:15:23,357 --> 00:15:25,750
- Her family's so worried.
How is--

382
00:15:25,794 --> 00:15:26,969
- Whoop, you okay?
- I'm fine.

383
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:28,144
- Why don't we take a seat?
- I'm fine.

384
00:15:28,188 --> 00:15:29,624
- Why don't we have a seat?

385
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:30,973
- No, I'm fine, really.
- Why don't we have a seat?

386
00:15:31,017 --> 00:15:32,148
- Tell me about Tamala.

387
00:15:32,192 --> 00:15:33,976
- There was a complication.

388
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,456
During surgery,
we found a tumor,

389
00:15:35,499 --> 00:15:37,066
and it was there
long before the crash,

390
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:40,374
but it has penetrated
her heart.

391
00:15:40,417 --> 00:15:41,375
So there's a number of things
we can do,

392
00:15:41,418 --> 00:15:42,811
but I need you to understand

393
00:15:42,854 --> 00:15:47,033
that your friend is facing
a very high-risk operation.

394
00:15:47,076 --> 00:15:50,819
- Well, it's covered.
Anything she needs is covered.

395
00:15:50,862 --> 00:15:53,953
I organized our trip.
It's all right here.

396
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:55,128
Look.

397
00:15:55,171 --> 00:15:56,999
When we rented the van,

398
00:15:57,043 --> 00:15:59,306
we paid for the personal injury
insurance.

399
00:15:59,349 --> 00:16:01,003
I've read the policy,
there's no limit.

400
00:16:01,047 --> 00:16:05,094
So she's entitled to
the best care you can offer.

401
00:16:05,138 --> 00:16:07,053
- Hmm.
- The very best.

402
00:16:07,096 --> 00:16:10,360
And I made everyone pay
the extra $7.50

403
00:16:10,404 --> 00:16:11,361
for the insurance.

404
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:12,928
They carried on a while, but--

405
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,321
- Well, I'm sure
they're thanking you now.

406
00:16:17,063 --> 00:16:21,763
- Dr. Goodwin, would you be
open to praying with me?

407
00:16:23,112 --> 00:16:26,942
- Um, I'm not really the most

408
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,162
prayerful of guys.

409
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,820
Sure.

410
00:16:40,564 --> 00:16:44,438
- Heavenly father
from whom all blessings flow.

411
00:16:44,481 --> 00:16:48,094
It was your will to work
through this accident.

412
00:16:48,137 --> 00:16:50,009
Bless the hands
of these surgeons

413
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:51,923
as they do your work.

414
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:55,536
We are your instruments, Lord,
prayerful or not.

415
00:16:55,579 --> 00:16:58,365
Bless us and show us the way.

416
00:17:02,499 --> 00:17:04,806
Lucky the accident happened
so close to us.

417
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:05,937
- Mm.

418
00:17:05,981 --> 00:17:07,852
Some are calling it
an act of God.

419
00:17:07,896 --> 00:17:08,940
- What do you think?

420
00:17:08,984 --> 00:17:10,855
- Well, I know is that

421
00:17:10,899 --> 00:17:12,161
half these women came in
with a host

422
00:17:12,205 --> 00:17:13,858
of preexisting conditions,

423
00:17:13,902 --> 00:17:16,383
diabetes, cervical cancer,
hypertension.

424
00:17:16,426 --> 00:17:18,559
And then they crash
right when they need care most.

425
00:17:18,602 --> 00:17:20,300
I don't know.
I'm a cynic.

426
00:17:20,343 --> 00:17:23,564
I mean, maybe it was
divine intervention.

427
00:17:23,607 --> 00:17:25,522
- Yeah.

428
00:17:25,566 --> 00:17:28,221
Maybe there was
an intervention.

429
00:17:28,264 --> 00:17:30,266
I just don't know
if it was divine.

430
00:17:51,418 --> 00:17:52,723
- Is there an update?

431
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:54,464
- Uh, no update.

432
00:17:54,508 --> 00:17:58,599
I just, uh...do you mind
if I sit?

433
00:18:01,906 --> 00:18:06,607
Um...I met this woman once,

434
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:09,914
and the amazing thing
about her was that

435
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:14,397
she loved her friends...
more than anything.

436
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:18,488
And her friends were
in trouble,

437
00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:19,707
through no fault of their own.

438
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,752
They couldn't get the care
that they needed.

439
00:18:21,796 --> 00:18:26,496
So she decided that she was
gonna help her friends...

440
00:18:27,932 --> 00:18:29,717
No matter what.

441
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:35,723
So she did something dangerous.

442
00:18:35,766 --> 00:18:38,465
And I would never tell you
her name,

443
00:18:38,508 --> 00:18:42,425
because I don't wanna
get her in trouble.

444
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:47,735
Because I respect her.

445
00:18:47,778 --> 00:18:50,564
- I expect
she appreciates that.

446
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:57,440
- But I do have a question
for her.

447
00:19:00,008 --> 00:19:03,316
How did things get so bad

448
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:05,056
that the only way she saw
to save her friends

449
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,755
was to crash their van?

450
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:18,418
- Perhaps it's what
this woman saw.

451
00:19:18,461 --> 00:19:22,857
She had a friend who used to
love going for walks.

452
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:26,730
Now she can't breathe.

453
00:19:26,774 --> 00:19:29,690
One's in and out
of a wheelchair,

454
00:19:29,733 --> 00:19:31,822
another died too early.

455
00:19:34,085 --> 00:19:37,828
This woman sees it all,
sees her friends at church,

456
00:19:37,872 --> 00:19:41,571
praying for the hospitals
to return,

457
00:19:41,615 --> 00:19:44,618
for money to buy medicine,

458
00:19:44,661 --> 00:19:48,709
for deliverance slow to come.

459
00:19:48,752 --> 00:19:52,191
So maybe she prays
for something different,

460
00:19:52,234 --> 00:19:56,673
for the strength to act,

461
00:19:56,717 --> 00:19:59,633
for a sign,

462
00:19:59,676 --> 00:20:01,504
and she gets nothing.

463
00:20:04,072 --> 00:20:08,729
Until a nice young man
at a van rental office

464
00:20:08,772 --> 00:20:13,603
offers to sell her supplemental
injury insurance.

465
00:20:15,997 --> 00:20:20,828
You spend your life wondering
what salvation will cost,

466
00:20:20,871 --> 00:20:25,659
and the answer turns out to be
$7.50.

467
00:20:27,095 --> 00:20:32,970
All I had to do was
one scary thing...

468
00:20:33,014 --> 00:20:36,235
And all our prayers were
answered.

469
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:40,064
"So do not fear,
for I am with you.

470
00:20:40,108 --> 00:20:44,765
"Do not be dismayed,
for I am your God.

471
00:20:44,808 --> 00:20:48,986
"I will strengthen
and help you.

472
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:53,904
I will uphold you
with my righteous right hand."

473
00:20:55,819 --> 00:20:58,169
- Meaning God will see you
through?

474
00:20:58,213 --> 00:21:00,215
- Meaning sometimes

475
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,436
you wait for the right hand
of God,

476
00:21:03,479 --> 00:21:07,004
but sometimes the hand is you.

477
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,751
- So me losing my concentration
is me having a seizure?

478
00:21:14,795 --> 00:21:15,970
- In some cases.

479
00:21:16,013 --> 00:21:18,494
Petit mal seizures present
in different ways.

480
00:21:18,538 --> 00:21:20,496
- And this is
from the diabetes too?

481
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,846
- Uncontrolled diabetes
puts you at a high risk

482
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,631
for strokes and other diseases.

483
00:21:24,674 --> 00:21:26,981
You should not drive until
you get this under control.

484
00:21:27,024 --> 00:21:28,765
- Well, if I can't drive,
how am I supposed to get

485
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:29,897
to a doctor for help?

486
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,941
- A church member
can't drive you?

487
00:21:30,985 --> 00:21:32,508
- An hour each way?

488
00:21:32,552 --> 00:21:33,901
- Perhaps family?

489
00:21:33,944 --> 00:21:37,296
- No one I can rely on.
I'm always bailing them out.

490
00:21:39,776 --> 00:21:41,038
- So what am I dying of?

491
00:21:42,997 --> 00:21:44,564
- Miss Alfreeda,
you're not dying.

492
00:21:44,607 --> 00:21:46,174
- Tell that to your face.

493
00:21:48,219 --> 00:21:50,004
- The swelling in your leg,

494
00:21:50,047 --> 00:21:52,789
we thought that it might be
cancer or a blood disorder,

495
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:53,834
but it's neither.

496
00:21:53,877 --> 00:21:55,879
It's your kidneys.
They're failing.

497
00:21:55,923 --> 00:21:57,272
- So I am dying.

498
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:00,580
- Well, your GFR is 16,

499
00:22:00,623 --> 00:22:02,930
which means that the creatinine
isn't clearing

500
00:22:02,973 --> 00:22:04,018
from your kidney,

501
00:22:04,061 --> 00:22:05,802
which means you need
a new kidney.

502
00:22:05,846 --> 00:22:07,717
- Well, it's a good thing
I brought a spare.

503
00:22:09,284 --> 00:22:12,722
- Well, you did bring a vanload
of potential donors.

504
00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:15,116
- You want me to take a kidney
from one of my church members?

505
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:17,727
- A blood relative
would be better, though.

506
00:22:17,771 --> 00:22:19,120
Do you have any family?

507
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:23,690
- No, I don't have any family
here.

508
00:22:23,733 --> 00:22:26,693
- Stop telling tales.
I'm her much younger sister.

509
00:22:26,736 --> 00:22:29,609
- Right.
I forgot about her.

510
00:22:29,652 --> 00:22:31,001
- See--you see how she is?

511
00:22:31,045 --> 00:22:32,307
I was gonna do
the Christian thing

512
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,004
and offer up one of my kidneys,

513
00:22:34,048 --> 00:22:36,050
but I ain't doing it now
unless she asks

514
00:22:36,093 --> 00:22:37,138
for once in her life.
- Nobody is asking you

515
00:22:37,181 --> 00:22:38,269
for anything.

516
00:22:38,313 --> 00:22:39,662
- Like, when I helped you keep

517
00:22:39,706 --> 00:22:41,142
Mom and Daddy's farm last year.

518
00:22:41,185 --> 00:22:42,665
Go ahead, tell the truth.
Shame the devil.

519
00:22:42,709 --> 00:22:44,275
- You know what?
That's right, baby sister.

520
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:46,930
Go on, keep Christ
in your heart and your kidney,

521
00:22:46,974 --> 00:22:48,715
because I don't want nothing
from you.

522
00:22:52,849 --> 00:22:54,851
- We'll have only two hours
for this.

523
00:22:54,895 --> 00:22:56,549
Why is that, Dr. Duke?

524
00:22:56,592 --> 00:22:58,638
- Because we're harvesting
the patient's own heart.

525
00:22:58,681 --> 00:23:00,335
After two hours,
the organ will degrade

526
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,684
beyond viability.

527
00:23:01,728 --> 00:23:03,033
- And the mass?

528
00:23:03,077 --> 00:23:06,210
- Is presenting posterior
as a left atrial mass.

529
00:23:06,254 --> 00:23:07,821
- And I can resect it
with clean margins

530
00:23:07,864 --> 00:23:10,345
in about 45 minutes,
maybe another 45

531
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,868
to restructure
the heart muscle.

532
00:23:11,912 --> 00:23:13,043
- That leaves you
with 30 minutes

533
00:23:13,087 --> 00:23:15,219
to sew it back in
and warm the trunk.

534
00:23:15,263 --> 00:23:16,873
Is there enough time for that?

535
00:23:16,917 --> 00:23:18,788
- Sitting about
4 degrees Celsius.

536
00:23:18,832 --> 00:23:21,008
- Okay.

537
00:23:21,051 --> 00:23:22,270
All right,
ladies and gentlemen,

538
00:23:22,313 --> 00:23:24,054
listen up.

539
00:23:24,098 --> 00:23:28,189
Now this may be
an atypical surgery for us,

540
00:23:28,232 --> 00:23:31,235
but what is typical is
our efficiency

541
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:33,324
and our precision.

542
00:23:33,368 --> 00:23:35,892
So use them today,

543
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,981
and we may have a chance
to save a life.

544
00:23:38,025 --> 00:23:39,722
Okay?

545
00:23:39,766 --> 00:23:41,071
Let's get after it.

546
00:23:41,115 --> 00:23:42,812
- You're fully on bypass.

547
00:23:42,856 --> 00:23:44,901
- SVC partial dissection
complete.

548
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,079
- Transecting
the ascending aorta.

549
00:23:52,343 --> 00:23:54,607
- Pulmonary artery clamped
and dissected.

550
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,609
- Aortic cross-clamp off.

551
00:23:56,652 --> 00:23:58,219
- Removing the heart.

552
00:23:58,262 --> 00:24:00,221
- Resection tray
right behind you.

553
00:24:00,264 --> 00:24:01,657
- Heart is on the move.

554
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:10,144
Start the clock.

555
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:23,070
- Pregnant?
Chante, you pregnant?

556
00:24:23,113 --> 00:24:24,811
- Yes, ma'am.

557
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,640
- Is it Mario?

558
00:24:27,683 --> 00:24:28,945
What'd I tell you
about messing around

559
00:24:28,989 --> 00:24:30,773
with that fast-ass boy?

560
00:24:30,817 --> 00:24:32,253
The baby.

561
00:24:32,296 --> 00:24:35,299
Is the baby okay?
What with the accident...

562
00:24:35,343 --> 00:24:39,086
- The fetus is totally unharmed
as far as we can tell.

563
00:24:39,129 --> 00:24:42,219
Thank you, Jesus.

564
00:24:42,263 --> 00:24:43,830
Okay.

565
00:24:45,396 --> 00:24:47,442
Okay.

566
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,792
We're gonna figure this out.

567
00:24:49,836 --> 00:24:52,491
- I don't wanna be a mommy.

568
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:55,058
- Oh, baby.

569
00:24:55,102 --> 00:24:57,408
I know it may seem scary
right now,

570
00:24:57,452 --> 00:25:00,063
but Auntie Kaye will be
right here.

571
00:25:00,107 --> 00:25:01,848
I took care of you, didn't I?

572
00:25:01,891 --> 00:25:03,153
We'll get through this.

573
00:25:03,197 --> 00:25:05,460
- Ms. Henry.

574
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,723
Chante has expressed
more than not wanting

575
00:25:07,767 --> 00:25:08,898
to be a mother.

576
00:25:08,942 --> 00:25:10,421
- Meaning?

577
00:25:10,465 --> 00:25:12,162
- Well, why don't we let Chante
take this opportunity

578
00:25:12,206 --> 00:25:14,338
to share her feelings?

579
00:25:16,732 --> 00:25:18,517
- I want an abortion.

580
00:25:23,391 --> 00:25:25,741
- Did you put her up to this?

581
00:25:25,785 --> 00:25:27,830
- No, but she is
clearly articulating

582
00:25:27,874 --> 00:25:30,267
her choice to end
this pregnancy.

583
00:25:30,311 --> 00:25:32,182
- Then she should have
clearly articulated

584
00:25:32,226 --> 00:25:33,967
that I am her legal guardian,

585
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:36,012
and I am in charge
of her decisions,

586
00:25:36,056 --> 00:25:37,536
including her medical ones.

587
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:38,928
- Okay.

588
00:25:38,972 --> 00:25:40,495
I--you need to know
that I'm just here

589
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,802
in support of Chante
and what she wants.

590
00:25:42,845 --> 00:25:45,021
And it seems like
this pregnancy

591
00:25:45,065 --> 00:25:46,501
would be a burden.

592
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,459
- Because you think we couldn't
care for this baby?

593
00:25:48,503 --> 00:25:49,939
- That's not what I'm saying--

594
00:25:49,983 --> 00:25:52,376
- We are more than capable
of taking care of our own.

595
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:55,205
Every child born
into this family is loved

596
00:25:55,249 --> 00:25:57,730
and extremely well
taken care of.

597
00:25:57,773 --> 00:26:00,167
Chante's child will be
no different.

598
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:02,256
- But is that what's best
for Chante?

599
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:04,867
- Based on what,
your 45 minutes of knowing her?

600
00:26:04,911 --> 00:26:06,129
- No.

601
00:26:06,173 --> 00:26:07,827
- Folks always want you
to make a choice,

602
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,350
then look at you funny
when you don't make the choice

603
00:26:09,393 --> 00:26:10,830
they wanted you to make.

604
00:26:10,873 --> 00:26:14,137
One side shakes their heads,
saying you're oppressed,

605
00:26:14,181 --> 00:26:16,096
the other filled
with so called "Christians"

606
00:26:16,139 --> 00:26:17,358
who don't give a damn
as soon as the baby

607
00:26:17,401 --> 00:26:19,186
gets pushed out.

608
00:26:19,229 --> 00:26:21,231
But let's be clear.

609
00:26:21,275 --> 00:26:23,494
This black family right here

610
00:26:23,538 --> 00:26:26,846
ain't being co-opted
for anyone's crusade.

611
00:26:28,935 --> 00:26:31,154
- Oh, Max!

612
00:26:32,286 --> 00:26:34,767
What about if I got you
a food service?

613
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:36,029
- Don't need it.

614
00:26:36,072 --> 00:26:37,160
- It would take the pressure
off of cooking.

615
00:26:37,204 --> 00:26:38,988
- Luna's still bottle feeding,
so...

616
00:26:39,032 --> 00:26:40,337
- Not for the baby, for you.

617
00:26:40,381 --> 00:26:41,817
- Oh.
- Be my treat.

618
00:26:41,861 --> 00:26:43,166
- Yeah, I'm good.

619
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:44,472
I eat most of my meals
at the hospital anyway.

620
00:26:44,515 --> 00:26:45,429
Have you tried
the pretzel and hummus combo?

621
00:26:45,473 --> 00:26:47,431
It's very--
- Max.

622
00:26:47,475 --> 00:26:48,955
- I'm good.

623
00:26:48,998 --> 00:26:50,521
- Why won't you let me
help you?

624
00:26:50,565 --> 00:26:51,827
- You know what?
How 'bout this?

625
00:26:51,871 --> 00:26:53,786
When I need your help,
I'll ask for it.

626
00:26:53,829 --> 00:26:56,832
- Speech therapist
to distro four.

627
00:26:56,876 --> 00:26:59,487
Speech therapist
to distro four.

628
00:27:02,316 --> 00:27:04,274
- How's our group?

629
00:27:04,318 --> 00:27:07,495
- Most are recovering,
and we've got aftercare plans

630
00:27:07,538 --> 00:27:09,236
for the noncritical ladies--

631
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,977
- Are you the medical director?

632
00:27:12,152 --> 00:27:14,545
- Is this about
my unpaid parking tickets?

633
00:27:14,589 --> 00:27:17,113
- We're following up
on the accident on the FDR.

634
00:27:17,157 --> 00:27:19,333
I'm Detective Grove.
This is Detective Vasquez.

635
00:27:19,376 --> 00:27:22,466
- Oh, why don't we discuss
this outside?

636
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,990
- We'd like to have
a conversation with the driver,

637
00:27:24,033 --> 00:27:25,295
Kaye Henry.

638
00:27:25,339 --> 00:27:26,819
- Well, she's recovering.

639
00:27:26,862 --> 00:27:28,821
- If she's awake and conscious,
we wanna talk to her.

640
00:27:28,864 --> 00:27:30,431
- And if she isn't, we'll wait.

641
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:47,100
- Kaye, the police are here
to speak to you.

642
00:27:48,971 --> 00:27:51,278
You understand there will be
repercussions

643
00:27:51,321 --> 00:27:54,107
if they find out the crash
was intentional.

644
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:56,109
- And the only option is
to tell the truth.

645
00:27:56,152 --> 00:27:58,459
So what are you saying?

646
00:27:58,502 --> 00:28:01,027
- That I don't want you
to go to jail

647
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:03,986
or your friends to lose
their insurance.

648
00:28:06,902 --> 00:28:09,035
- But they didn't do
anything wrong.

649
00:28:09,078 --> 00:28:10,863
They don't even know
what I did.

650
00:28:10,906 --> 00:28:13,169
- It doesn't matter.

651
00:28:13,213 --> 00:28:16,129
Deliberate actions negate
the policy you purchased.

652
00:28:22,222 --> 00:28:24,050
- For a while there,

653
00:28:24,093 --> 00:28:26,530
I really thought I was doing
God's will.

654
00:28:28,184 --> 00:28:32,319
But this and Chante...

655
00:28:33,537 --> 00:28:36,671
I was all wrong.

656
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:43,025
Now it's time to do right,
Dr. Goodwin.

657
00:28:43,069 --> 00:28:46,507
This isn't in my hands,
never was.

658
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,683
- Kaye, what are you gonna
tell the police?

659
00:29:09,225 --> 00:29:12,925
- I continue to be thrilled
that I am an only child.

660
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,188
- What do you mean?

661
00:29:15,231 --> 00:29:17,016
- Verdene and Alfreeda letting
decades old personal drama

662
00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:18,365
get in the way of their health.

663
00:29:18,408 --> 00:29:20,584
- Will it kill Alfreeda to ask?
It's a kidney.

664
00:29:27,287 --> 00:29:28,941
- But why offer someone
something

665
00:29:28,984 --> 00:29:30,420
and then make them ask for it?

666
00:29:30,464 --> 00:29:31,987
- Asking isn't such a big deal.

667
00:29:32,031 --> 00:29:33,989
- So it makes perfect sense
that Alfreeda could die

668
00:29:34,033 --> 00:29:35,425
while Verdene keeps
her kidney hostage,

669
00:29:35,469 --> 00:29:36,992
waiting for her to ask for it?

670
00:29:37,036 --> 00:29:37,993
- It's about respect.

671
00:29:38,037 --> 00:29:39,125
Verdene has sacrificed

672
00:29:39,168 --> 00:29:40,387
her own health,
swooping in to help

673
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,954
her entire family,
never getting

674
00:29:41,997 --> 00:29:43,216
a word of praise.

675
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:44,652
- I'm sure no one ask her
to be their savior.

676
00:29:44,695 --> 00:29:45,914
She's doing it
for the attention.

677
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:47,220
- That's not true.
- Of course it is.

678
00:29:47,263 --> 00:29:48,351
She's gotta be the bride
at every wedding

679
00:29:48,395 --> 00:29:49,483
and the corpse
at every funeral.

680
00:29:49,526 --> 00:29:51,528
- Come on,
show her some R-E-S-P-E-C-T.

681
00:29:51,572 --> 00:29:52,573
Respect.

682
00:29:52,616 --> 00:29:55,402
- Respect is earned,
not demanded.

683
00:30:22,777 --> 00:30:24,779
- Hi, Chante.
- Hi.

684
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:28,435
- So Chante, I brought
Dr. Bloom here with me,

685
00:30:28,478 --> 00:30:31,220
because I thought
you might feel more comfortable

686
00:30:31,264 --> 00:30:33,092
speaking with a female doctor.

687
00:30:33,135 --> 00:30:36,095
I also wanted to tell you that
we went around the hospital

688
00:30:36,138 --> 00:30:37,487
and we spoke to some lawyers
here.

689
00:30:37,531 --> 00:30:40,490
- And if you want to have
an abortion, then you can.

690
00:30:40,534 --> 00:30:42,753
- Yeah.
- But Kaye said no.

691
00:30:42,797 --> 00:30:46,018
- Yes, I know,
but as your guardian,

692
00:30:46,061 --> 00:30:48,107
she is there to support you
whenever you can't

693
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,325
make a decision on your own.

694
00:30:49,369 --> 00:30:50,500
But in this case,

695
00:30:50,544 --> 00:30:52,241
I think it's very clear
that you can.

696
00:30:52,285 --> 00:30:53,547
- And as you're
only nine weeks,

697
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,810
it is still legally
your choice to make.

698
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:59,683
- I don't want Kaye mad at me.

699
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,513
- Chante, you know,
I had to make a choice too

700
00:31:03,557 --> 00:31:05,776
when I was your age.

701
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:10,129
Doing what was right for me,
it helped me make that choice.

702
00:31:10,172 --> 00:31:14,002
Didn't make it any easier,
but it did make it clearer.

703
00:31:14,046 --> 00:31:16,309
Do you wanna have an abortion?

704
00:31:16,352 --> 00:31:18,224
- Yeah.

705
00:31:18,267 --> 00:31:20,530
- Okay.

706
00:31:23,446 --> 00:31:25,274
Now, look, since you're
under guardianship,

707
00:31:25,318 --> 00:31:27,407
we just need to ask you
a few more questions.

708
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:28,669
- More questions?

709
00:31:28,712 --> 00:31:29,670
- Just to make sure
that you have

710
00:31:29,713 --> 00:31:31,150
thought everything through.

711
00:31:31,193 --> 00:31:33,804
Like, after the abortion,
what's your plan?

712
00:31:33,848 --> 00:31:35,719
- My plan?

713
00:31:35,763 --> 00:31:39,332
- Your relationship with Kaye,
um...

714
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:40,681
it may change.

715
00:31:48,297 --> 00:31:50,517
- Like, if she's mad

716
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,128
and doesn't want me
to live with her no more?

717
00:31:53,172 --> 00:31:57,698
- Not living with Kaye is
a possibility.

718
00:31:57,741 --> 00:31:59,352
Something that you have
to think about.

719
00:31:59,395 --> 00:32:01,702
- And I can't lose Kaye.

720
00:32:01,745 --> 00:32:04,574
I can't lose Kaye.

721
00:32:04,618 --> 00:32:06,750
- Which is why we need a plan.

722
00:32:06,794 --> 00:32:08,622
- I don't need a plan.

723
00:32:08,665 --> 00:32:11,364
I don't need a plan.

724
00:32:11,407 --> 00:32:14,541
I need just Kaye.

725
00:32:22,244 --> 00:32:24,855
- Uh, excuse me, Detective,
where you taking her?

726
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:26,901
- The precinct.
It's none of your concern.

727
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,729
- Uh, you're taking a patient
out of my hospital.

728
00:32:28,772 --> 00:32:30,861
I'm very concerned.
Kaye, what did you say?

729
00:32:30,905 --> 00:32:32,863
- Nothing,
just that she lost her way.

730
00:32:32,907 --> 00:32:34,735
So now we go to the precinct.

731
00:32:41,437 --> 00:32:43,744
- I'm attaching the aorta.
- You have 45 seconds.

732
00:32:43,787 --> 00:32:45,876
- Still have to do
the pulmonary vein.

733
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,182
Duke, I need those hands.

734
00:32:47,226 --> 00:32:48,531
- Target core temp
is 37 Celsius.

735
00:32:48,575 --> 00:32:50,229
- Sir?
- That's the pulmonary vein.

736
00:32:50,272 --> 00:32:52,405
Right there.
Use your 6-0 Prolene stitch.

737
00:32:52,448 --> 00:32:53,754
Don't back wall the vein, stat.

738
00:32:53,797 --> 00:32:55,234
- Give me a 6-0 Prolene
on a stick tie.

739
00:32:55,277 --> 00:32:57,758
- Idle breathing looks good.

740
00:32:59,194 --> 00:33:00,456
- She's normalizing.

741
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,502
- You have five seconds,
but they're flicking by.

742
00:33:04,634 --> 00:33:06,767
- Vitals are stable.

743
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:08,464
- Ah, the boot should be wider

744
00:33:08,508 --> 00:33:09,683
- Time.

745
00:33:09,726 --> 00:33:10,858
Time, Dr. Reynolds.
- I hear you.

746
00:33:10,901 --> 00:33:13,774
Almost there.
- Full shocks, holding.

747
00:33:13,817 --> 00:33:16,124
Detractor number two.
- Clamps.

748
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:20,520
Duke.
- Done.

749
00:33:20,563 --> 00:33:22,130
- Charging.

750
00:33:22,174 --> 00:33:23,697
Clear.

751
00:33:30,443 --> 00:33:33,576
Got a heartbeat.
- I got a pulse.

752
00:33:37,493 --> 00:33:38,581
Dr. Reynolds.

753
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,933
- The brainwaves aren't
picking up.

754
00:33:47,677 --> 00:33:49,853
Brain's warming too slowly.

755
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,553
- Does that mean
she has brain damage?

756
00:33:53,596 --> 00:33:56,469
- We won't know
until she wakes up.

757
00:34:01,604 --> 00:34:02,823
- A little help here.

758
00:34:02,866 --> 00:34:03,780
- Get her to bay 24.

759
00:34:03,824 --> 00:34:05,260
What happened?

760
00:34:05,304 --> 00:34:06,609
- We were driving away
and she just started seizing.

761
00:34:06,653 --> 00:34:07,915
- Casey, do a finger stick.
- What's going on?

762
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:09,656
- We need ten units of insulin.

763
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:12,441
- Blood glucose at 550.

764
00:34:13,964 --> 00:34:16,402
- I need ten units of insulin,
subq.

765
00:34:23,452 --> 00:34:24,671
- Is she okay?

766
00:34:24,714 --> 00:34:26,412
- Kaye's a brittle diabetic.

767
00:34:26,455 --> 00:34:28,544
- Brittle?
- It's a form of diabetes.

768
00:34:28,588 --> 00:34:31,634
It manifests with dramatic
spiking of blood sugar levels.

769
00:34:31,678 --> 00:34:34,289
- Could that have caused
the accident?

770
00:34:38,902 --> 00:34:41,253
- Very well could have.

771
00:34:53,526 --> 00:34:55,484
- How are you feeling,
Miss Verdene?

772
00:34:55,528 --> 00:34:57,834
- Well, it ain't childbirth.

773
00:34:57,878 --> 00:34:59,706
How long till you know
if I'm a match?

774
00:34:59,749 --> 00:35:01,664
- Could be as soon as tomorrow.

775
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:05,842
- You can say thank you now.

776
00:35:05,886 --> 00:35:07,714
- I could.

777
00:35:10,412 --> 00:35:12,675
Fine.

778
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:14,329
Thank you.

779
00:35:14,373 --> 00:35:16,897
- Now, was that so hard?

780
00:35:20,814 --> 00:35:22,207
- Well done, Vijay.

781
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:24,209
Acting out their ridiculous
feud in front of them.

782
00:35:24,252 --> 00:35:26,689
- Who was acting?

783
00:35:26,733 --> 00:35:29,039
- You weren't really upset,
were you?

784
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:30,998
- Talk to my hand.

785
00:35:38,571 --> 00:35:40,790
- Um, hi.

786
00:35:40,834 --> 00:35:41,922
- Hi.

787
00:35:41,965 --> 00:35:44,272
- I should learn to accept
a blessing

788
00:35:44,316 --> 00:35:45,882
when it's offered to me, right?

789
00:35:45,926 --> 00:35:49,495
And to be, you know,
less of a jerk.

790
00:35:53,542 --> 00:35:55,414
- Well, it's about time.

791
00:36:02,551 --> 00:36:05,293
Oh, and some other ideas
I've been noodling:

792
00:36:05,337 --> 00:36:06,555
a diaper service.

793
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:08,078
Or what about a CSA?

794
00:36:08,122 --> 00:36:09,863
Or how would you feel about
your very own car service?

795
00:36:09,906 --> 00:36:13,736
- It all sounds great.
Surprise me.

796
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:16,652
- Okay.

797
00:36:16,696 --> 00:36:19,394
- Auntie Kaye!

798
00:36:19,438 --> 00:36:21,744
- Chante.

799
00:36:22,919 --> 00:36:24,617
You're about to squeeze me
in half.

800
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,401
- I don't wanna lose you.

801
00:36:26,445 --> 00:36:28,490
- I'm not going anywhere.

802
00:36:28,534 --> 00:36:30,275
- Don't go, don't go.
- I'm right here.

803
00:36:32,799 --> 00:36:35,367
- The court is restoring
Chante's right

804
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:36,846
to make this medical choice.

805
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:41,024
And, um...she hasn't made
a decision yet,

806
00:36:41,068 --> 00:36:43,026
because she's a little bit
scared of how

807
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,550
it might affect
your relationship.

808
00:36:44,593 --> 00:36:47,814
- Auntie Kaye,
will you still love me?

809
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:52,384
- Always.

810
00:36:52,427 --> 00:36:53,994
But you're blocking a blessing,
Chante.

811
00:36:54,037 --> 00:36:56,301
- No, I'm not.
God's with me.

812
00:36:56,344 --> 00:36:57,606
- God is with you?

813
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:59,956
- I prayed no baby.

814
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,958
God crashed the van here.

815
00:37:02,002 --> 00:37:05,048
The doctor said "no baby," see?

816
00:37:07,747 --> 00:37:09,401
- I crashed the van.

817
00:37:10,402 --> 00:37:13,622
It was me.
God had nothing to do with it.

818
00:37:13,666 --> 00:37:15,711
- God's in you.

819
00:37:18,888 --> 00:37:21,978
- Is God in me?

820
00:37:22,022 --> 00:37:25,330
No.
No, that's not--

821
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:33,120
I don't know.

822
00:37:33,163 --> 00:37:34,774
I don't know.

823
00:37:36,863 --> 00:37:38,604
I hope so.

824
00:37:38,647 --> 00:37:40,649

Auntie Kaye.

826
00:37:53,749 --> 00:37:55,882
- Still no change?

827
00:37:58,624 --> 00:37:59,842
- No.

828
00:38:01,061 --> 00:38:03,585
Tamala kind of reminds me
of my mom too.
