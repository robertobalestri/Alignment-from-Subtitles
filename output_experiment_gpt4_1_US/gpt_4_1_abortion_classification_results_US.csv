CM,1,1,CMS01E01,No,
CM,1,2,CMS01E02,Yes,"The episode centers around a 14-year-old girl, Erika, who gives birth alone, abandons her baby, and nearly dies from blood loss and complications related to childbirth. The dialogue repeatedly references her being a child, unready for pregnancy, and the trauma and consequences of her situation. There are implicit references to unwanted pregnancy, lack of support, and the desperate circumstances leading to unsafe birth and abandonment. While abortion or pregnancy termination is not explicitly discussed, the entire storyline strongly implies themes of unwanted pregnancy, lack of options, and the consequences thereof, which are closely related to the topic of abortion."

CM,1,10,CMS01E10,No,
CM,1,11,CMS01E11,No,
CM,1,12,CMS01E12,Yes,"There is an explicit reference to abortion or pregnancy termination in the following exchange: A character says, 'my parents, they thought I should terminate. 'Cause, you know, ""A baby needs a father."" But no, no, I just--I couldn't. So here we are...' This directly mentions the option of pregnancy termination (abortion) and the character's decision not to go through with it."
CM,1,13,CMS01E13,No,
CM,1,14,CMS01E14,No,
CM,1,15,CMS01E15,Yes,"There is an explicit discussion of a surrogate mother who is desperate not to deliver a baby prematurely because she needs the money from carrying to term, and is pressured to consider early delivery due to a medical emergency. She says, 'I can't have this baby! It's not due for another two months.' The episode discusses her options, the risks to her life, and the legal/contractual implications if the baby is delivered early. While abortion or pregnancy termination is not directly mentioned, the storyline revolves around the decision of whether to end a pregnancy early (premature delivery) due to health risks, and the consequences thereof. The themes of unwanted pregnancy, discussing options, and seeking a procedure (early delivery) are present, so the topic is at least implied."
CM,1,16,CMS01E16,No,
CM,1,17,CMS01E17,No,
CM,1,18,CMS01E18,No,
CM,2,1,CMS02E01,No,

CM,2,6,CMS02E06,No,
CM,2,7,CMS02E07,No,
CM,2,8,CMS02E08,Yes,"The topic of pregnancy and its complications is explicitly discussed. April discovers she is pregnant, and there is an extended conversation about her needing to take a medication for multi-drug resistant TB that could cause neural tube defects in the fetus. April discusses the risks to the pregnancy, her fears about harming the baby, and her struggle over whether to take the medication or not. The dialogue includes considering the possibility of harm to the fetus and the risk of both mother and baby dying if the medication is not taken. These discussions strongly imply consideration of pregnancy termination as a possible outcome, or at least the risk thereof, and the weighing of options in a high-risk pregnancy scenario."
CM,2,9,CMS02E09,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is explicitly discussed in the conversation between April and Tate. When April's fetal ultrasound shows a low measurement and possible risk to the baby's health, Tate says, 'Look. You're 12 weeks. If we're considering...' and April cuts him off, 'We're not.' Tate continues, 'April, it's not what I want either, but if your health is in question, the quality of life of our baby is threatened, I... We need to understand this gets riskier, more complicated after 14 weeks.' April responds, 'Tate, I am Catholic.' Tate says, 'April, it's my baby, too. Don't I at least get to discuss this?' April insists, 'We are not terminating this pregnancy.' This is a direct and explicit reference to abortion/pregnancy termination."
CM,2,10,CMS02E10,Yes,"There is an explicit reference to considering pregnancy termination in the following exchange: 'If it was up to you, there wouldn't even be a baby.' 'April, I told you I'm sorry. The only reason I wanted to consider terminating was I thought the baby would have no quality of life. I didn't want to put you... Us through that.' This directly mentions the option of terminating a pregnancy, which is an explicit reference to abortion or pregnancy termination."
CM,2,11,CMS02E11,Yes,"There is a conversation between April and Tate where Tate expresses concern about April working while pregnant, and specifically mentions 'the baby' and her having TB. April responds by saying 'Pregnant women can work' and 'I'm so sick of you bringing up this work thing.' While the conversation is about working while pregnant and not about abortion explicitly, the concern about the health and safety of the pregnancy, and the repeated arguments about whether she should continue working, could implicitly suggest consideration of pregnancy outcomes or options. Since the instructions say to answer Yes if there is any doubt and to include implicit references, the answer is Yes."
CM,2,12,CMS02E12,No,
CM,2,13,CMS02E13,No,
CM,2,14,CMS02E14,No,
CM,2,15,CMS02E15,Yes,The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is explicitly mentioned in the subtitles. April is told she will need a D&C (dilation and curettage) after her ultrasound reveals there is no fetal heartbeat. The D&C is a procedure to remove the contents of the uterus after a miscarriage or for pregnancy termination. The conversation about scheduling the procedure and April's emotional response further confirm that pregnancy loss and termination are directly addressed.
CM,2,16,CMS02E16,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is explicitly mentioned in the subtitles. There is a scene where a doctor discusses with the parents of a pregnant, vegetative patient (Teresa) that 'termination will be a painless procedure.' The parents respond that they do not want a termination and want to keep the baby, but the doctor explains the high risks of continuing the pregnancy. The conversation directly addresses the option of pregnancy termination, making the reference explicit."
CM,2,17,CMS02E17,Yes,"There is an explicit reference to a miscarriage in the conversation between April and Tate: 'I know that you blame me for the miscarriage. April... No, admit it. No matter how many times you're told that my working had nothing to do with it, you just... You won't let it go.' While the word 'abortion' or 'pregnancy termination' is not used, a miscarriage is a form of pregnancy loss, and discussions of blame and work-related causes can sometimes be associated with broader conversations about pregnancy termination or loss. Given the instruction to answer Yes if there is any doubt, and to include implicit references, the topic is present."
CM,2,18,CMS02E18,No,
CM,2,19,CMS02E19,No,
CM,2,20,CMS02E20,No,
CM,2,21,CMS02E21,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is explicitly mentioned and discussed in the case of Gayle Parks, who is 21 weeks pregnant and in heart failure. The doctors recommend 'the safest choice in cases like this is to take the load off of your system and terminate the pregnancy.' The family discusses this option, and the ethical dilemma of risking the mother's life to continue the pregnancy is a central plot point. The episode contains explicit references to pregnancy termination as a medical option."
CM,2,22,CMS02E22,No,
CM,2,23,CMS02E23,Yes,"There is an implicit reference to pregnancy and potentially pregnancy termination. Christina reveals 'I'm pregnant. We didn't mean it to happen. We thought we were being careful. We were going to get married after graduation. Nobody knows.' While abortion or pregnancy termination is not explicitly discussed, the context of an unplanned pregnancy, secrecy, and distress in a hospital setting strongly implies that the topic could be discussed or considered, especially given the prompt's instruction to answer Yes if there is any doubt."
CM,3,1,CMS03E01,No,
CM,3,2,CMS03E02,No,
CM,3,3,CMS03E03,No,
CM,3,4,CMS03E04,No,
CM,3,5,CMS03E05,No,
CM,3,6,CMS03E06,No,
CM,3,7,CMS03E07,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is implied in the storyline involving LeAnn Crawford. She is a young woman who never planned on getting pregnant, is struggling with drug addiction, and expresses regret about her situation. The dialogue includes her saying 'I never planned on getting pregnant. You know? Whatever.' and the medical staff discussing options and outcomes for her and her baby. While abortion is not mentioned explicitly, the context of unwanted pregnancy, regret, and the discussion of 'options' and 'wishes' around pregnancy and motherhood strongly imply the topic is present."
CM,3,8,CMS03E08,No,
CM,3,9,CMS03E09,No,
CM,3,10,CMS03E10,Yes,"The episode contains an explicit storyline involving a 14-year-old girl, Lindsay, who is married to an adult and has suffered a miscarriage. She is found to have a malignant tumor and is presented with treatment options, including chemotherapy and, in a worst-case scenario, a hysterectomy. Lindsay ultimately chooses to have a hysterectomy, explicitly stating she does not want to bring a child into her current situation. The discussion of her agency, her desire to avoid future pregnancies, and the irreversible nature of the procedure all strongly imply the topic of pregnancy termination and unwanted pregnancy. Additionally, the D&C procedure performed to remove 'products from her prior miscarriage' can sometimes be associated with abortion care, further supporting the presence of this topic."
CM,3,11,CMS03E11,No,
CM,3,12,CMS03E12,No,
CM,3,13,CMS03E13,No,
CM,3,14,CMS03E14,Yes,"There is an implicit reference to pregnancy loss and the psychological aftermath: a woman named Joanna Harris, who previously lost a baby at 22 weeks (which could have been a miscarriage or a medically-indicated termination), abducts a baby from the hospital. The dialogue discusses her 'birth trauma,' 'overwhelming fear of never being able to carry a baby to term,' and her actions being driven by this loss. While abortion or pregnancy termination is not explicitly mentioned, the themes of pregnancy loss and its consequences are present, which can include or imply termination depending on context. Given the instruction to answer Yes if there is any doubt, the answer is Yes."
CM,3,15,CMS03E15,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is implied during the discussion about the conjoined twins, Lily and Dot. The medical team debates whether to perform a risky surgery to try to save both twins or to separate them immediately, which would result in the death of one (Lily) to save the other (Dot). The dialogue includes explicit lines such as 'Are we actually discussing terminating Lily's life?' and 'Let's save the one child.' This discussion about intentionally ending the life of one twin to save the other constitutes an implicit reference to pregnancy termination or abortion, as it involves making a decision to end a life for medical reasons."
CM,3,16,CMS03E16,No,
CM,3,17,CMS03E17,No,
CM,3,18,CMS03E18,No,
CM,3,19,CMS03E19,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is explicitly discussed in the case of Tracy Herman, a 21-weeks pregnant woman with a heart defect. The doctors recommend pregnancy termination before surgery due to the risk to her life, and there is an extended discussion about the risks, the patient's wishes, and the medical options, including the ethical and emotional aspects of terminating the pregnancy. The terms 'terminate' and 'emergency hysterectomy' (which would end the pregnancy) are used, and the storyline revolves around the decision and its consequences."
CM,3,20,CMS03E20,No,
CM,4,1,CMS04E01,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is implied in the conversation between Ethan and April regarding Emily's pregnancy. Ethan says, 'Emily can't have this baby,' and lists reasons such as her instability, history of drug abuse, and inability to care for a child. This discussion about whether Emily should continue the pregnancy, and the explicit statement that 'Emily can't have this baby,' strongly suggests the topic of pregnancy termination is being considered, even if not stated outright."
CM,4,2,CMS04E02,No,
CM,4,3,CMS04E03,Yes,"The episode features a storyline involving a woman with an ectopic pregnancy. The medical team discusses the necessity of surgically removing the fetus to save the mother's life, and the woman initially refuses surgery due to her religious beliefs. There are explicit references to the loss of the fetus, the impossibility of its survival, and the ethical and medical dilemmas surrounding the termination of the pregnancy. This is a clear mention and implication of pregnancy termination/abortion."
CM,4,4,CMS04E04,Yes,"There are several references to pregnancy and related issues in the subtitles. Most explicitly, in the final scene, Bernie says to Ethan: 'We start dating, we shouldn't, and I get her pregnant.' He then says, 'I'm gonna take care of her. And our baby.' Earlier, there are discussions about healthy eating 'for the baby,' and a character's wife is described as pregnant. However, there is no explicit or implicit mention of abortion, pregnancy termination, unwanted pregnancy, or discussing options for termination. The pregnancy is acknowledged and accepted, and the characters discuss taking care of the baby. There is no indication of considering or seeking an abortion or pregnancy termination. However, since the instructions say to answer 'Yes' if there is any doubt, and there is a brief mention of an unplanned pregnancy ('we shouldn't, and I get her pregnant'), there is a slight implication of an unplanned pregnancy, though not of abortion or termination. Therefore, per instructions, the answer is 'Yes'."
CM,4,5,CMS04E05,No,
CM,4,6,CMS04E06,No,
CM,4,7,CMS04E07,No,
CM,4,8,CMS04E08,No,
CM,4,9,CMS04E09,No,
CM,4,10,CMS04E10,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is implied in the storyline involving Ivy Davis, who is 30 weeks pregnant with a pre-existing aneurysm. The medical team discusses the risks of her continuing the pregnancy and the urgency of a C-section. While the episode does not explicitly mention abortion or pregnancy termination, the discussion of medical risks to the mother and the need to deliver the baby early due to life-threatening complications is closely related to the topic. Additionally, there are discussions about unwanted pregnancy and the emotional aftermath of losing a spouse while pregnant, which can also be considered implicit references."
CM,4,11,CMS04E11,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is explicitly discussed in the context of a surrogate pregnancy with twins, where the medical team recommends 'selective reduction' (terminating one fetus to save the other). The surrogate and the intended parents debate whether to proceed with the procedure, and the legal and ethical implications are discussed at length. The terms 'procedure,' 'selective reduction,' and 'lose him' are used, all directly referring to pregnancy termination."
CM,4,12,CMS04E12,Yes,"The episode contains an explicit storyline about Barbara, a 21-weeks-pregnant woman with Down syndrome and a congenital heart defect. The medical team discusses the risks of surgery to her and the fetus, and whether to proceed with a procedure that may result in the loss of the pregnancy. There are explicit conversations about the risk that 'the baby might die,' 'if it does, your baby is too small to survive on its own,' and 'they're gonna kill my baby!' These discussions directly address the possibility of pregnancy termination as a consequence of medical intervention, and the ethical and legal decision-making around it."
CM,4,13,CMS04E13,No,
CM,4,14,CMS04E14,No,
CM,4,15,CMS04E15,No,
CM,4,16,CMS04E16,No,
CM,4,17,CMS04E17,No,
CM,4,18,CMS04E18,Yes,"The topic of abortion and pregnancy termination is explicitly discussed in the subtitles. A 17-year-old girl, Jenny, is revealed to have taken mifepristone (an abortion pill) after an unwanted pregnancy, without parental knowledge. The medical staff discuss her incomplete abortion, the need for the follow-up medication (misoprostol), and later a D&C procedure due to retained tissue. The episode also addresses legal and ethical issues around minors, parental consent, and confidentiality in abortion care."
CM,4,19,CMS04E19,No,
CM,4,20,CMS04E20,No,
CM,4,21,CMS04E21,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is implied in the storyline involving Desiree, who is pregnant with stage four cancer. She and her husband discuss options regarding her treatment, which could harm the fetus, and her refusal of treatment to protect the pregnancy. The medical team discusses the risks to the fetus if surgery is performed, and the possibility of her becoming 'one human incubator' if she does not have surgery. The situation centers around the difficult choice between continuing the pregnancy at the expense of the mother's health or pursuing treatment that could terminate the pregnancy, which is an implicit reference to pregnancy termination."
CM,4,22,CMS04E22,No,
CM,5,1,CMS05E01,Yes,"There are several references to pregnancy and potential pregnancy. One character says 'I'm late. Late? My period.' and later, 'It's negative. I'm not pregnant.' This storyline implies concern about a possible unwanted pregnancy and the consideration of options, which can implicitly include abortion or pregnancy termination even if not explicitly stated. Given the instructions to answer Yes if there is any doubt or implicit reference, the answer is Yes."
CM,5,2,CMS05E02,No,
CM,5,3,CMS05E03,No,

CM,5,14,CMS05E14,No,
CM,5,15,CMS05E15,No,
CM,5,16,CMS05E16,Yes,"There are several references to fertility treatments, hormone therapy, and inseminating eggs, as well as discussions about whether eggs fertilized or not. While there is no explicit mention of abortion or pregnancy termination, the discussion of fertility options, hormone therapy, and the emotional reactions to the results of insemination could implicitly involve conversations about pregnancy, reproductive choices, and possibly the consideration of termination in other contexts. Given the instruction to answer Yes if there is any doubt, the answer is Yes."
CM,5,17,CMS05E17,Yes,"The episode contains multiple references to IVF (in vitro fertilization), failed egg fertilization, and the emotional and physical toll of fertility treatments. There are discussions about inseminating eggs, none of them fertilizing, starting another cycle, and the desire for a baby. While abortion or pregnancy termination is not explicitly mentioned, the context of unwanted or unsuccessful pregnancies, fertility struggles, and making difficult reproductive decisions are present, which can implicitly relate to the broader topic of pregnancy termination and reproductive choices."
CM,5,18,CMS05E18,No,
CM,5,19,CMS05E19,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is explicitly mentioned and discussed in the case of Marcie Burton, who is 19 weeks pregnant and experiencing complications. The medical team discusses the possibility of terminating the pregnancy as the safest option, and later, during surgery, they state 'We need to terminate the pregnancy' and proceed with a hysterotomy. The episode also involves discussions about the risks of continuing the pregnancy and the patient's wishes regarding her baby, all of which are directly related to pregnancy termination."

CM,6,3,CMS06E03,No,
CM,6,4,CMS06E04,No,
CM,6,5,CMS06E05,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is implied in the scene where Anna discovers she is pregnant after seeking birth control. The doctor discusses her options and suggests looping in her parents, and says she will get Anna some information. This strongly suggests that the topic of pregnancy options, including abortion, is being considered, even if not stated explicitly."
CM,6,6,CMS06E06,Yes,"The topic of pregnancy and its termination is both explicitly and implicitly referenced. Anna, a 15-year-old, is revealed to be pregnant after her father finds evidence (likely a pregnancy test or related items). Later, Anna experiences bleeding and is taken to the hospital, where she is told she had a 'chemical pregnancy,' which is described as an early miscarriage where the fertilized egg does not fully implant. The episode discusses her pregnancy, her fear of telling her mother, and the emotional impact. The discussion of options, the fear, and the medical explanation of a chemical pregnancy all touch on themes of unwanted pregnancy and its resolution, which can be considered an implicit reference to pregnancy termination."
CM,6,7,CMS06E07,No,
CM,6,8,CMS06E08,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is implied in several places. First, there is mention of a 'chemical pregnancy' and a 'pregnancy scare' involving a teenage girl, Anna. Later, it is revealed that Anna 'got pregnant' and it was a 'chemical pregnancy,' which often refers to a very early miscarriage, but the context involves secrecy, distress, and discussion of options, which can be associated with unwanted pregnancy and the consideration of termination. Additionally, Maggie shares that she became pregnant as a teenager and 'agreed to put the baby up for adoption,' which, while not abortion, is related to pregnancy options and unwanted pregnancy. The combination of these references—especially the secrecy, stress, and discussion of a 'chemical pregnancy'—suggests the topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is at least implied."
CM,6,9,CMS06E09,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is implied in the storyline involving Tionne, who is a pregnant woman experiencing complications and financial hardship. There is also a scene where DCFS (Department of Children and Family Services) is involved, and Maggie discusses having given her baby up for adoption as a teenager. Tionne is shown considering giving her baby up for adoption, expressing doubts about her ability to care for him, and discussing her options with Maggie. While abortion is not explicitly mentioned, the episode deals with themes of unwanted pregnancy, crisis pregnancy, and a woman considering her options, which implicitly includes the topic of pregnancy termination."

CM,7,12,CMS07E12,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is implied in the storyline involving Lisa Backman, a pregnant woman who is 34 weeks along and experiencing medical complications. The doctors discuss the risks of her anemia, a possible placental abruption, and the need for an urgent C-section. They explicitly mention the risk of hemorrhage and the possibility that she could die if she refuses a blood transfusion. While the episode does not explicitly mention abortion or pregnancy termination, the medical discussions about the risks to the mother and fetus, the need to discuss options, and the potential for maternal death due to refusal of treatment all implicitly touch on the topic of pregnancy termination as a possible outcome. Given the instructions to answer 'Yes' if there is any doubt, the answer is Yes."

CM,7,18,CMS07E18,No,
CM,7,19,CMS07E19,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is explicitly discussed in the subplot involving Ingrid, a surrogate. Ingrid reveals that when a genetic panel suggested the baby might have spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), the intended parents decided to terminate the pregnancy, but Ingrid chose not to go through with the termination and carried the baby to term. The intended mother later expresses regret about the decision to terminate. These conversations directly reference pregnancy termination and the decision-making process around it."
CM,7,20,CMS07E20,No,
CM,7,21,CMS07E21,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is implied in the storyline involving Kat, the 22-year-old single pregnant woman. While the episode focuses on her medical emergency (acute fatty liver of pregnancy) and the need for an early C-section, there is discussion of difficult choices regarding her pregnancy, including the risks to both mother and baby, and the need to deliver early to save her life. The dialogue about 'not liking the choices,' 'the only cure is to deliver,' and the weighing of risks to mother and child implicitly touches on themes often associated with pregnancy termination decisions, even though abortion is not explicitly mentioned. Given the instruction to answer 'Yes' if there is any doubt and to include implicit references, the answer is Yes."

CM,8,1,CMS08E01,No,
CM,8,2,CMS08E02,No,
CM,8,3,CMS08E03,Yes,"The topic of pregnancy and related medical care is explicitly mentioned multiple times (e.g., Liza is 12 weeks pregnant, seeking care for vomiting, and discussing genetic testing). There is also an implicit reference to pregnancy options and potential pregnancy termination: Liza is given referrals for OB-GYN and genetic counseling, which often includes discussion of options such as termination, especially when genetic testing is offered. Additionally, the script includes a patient expressing concern about her drug use during pregnancy and fear of her baby being taken away, which can relate to discussions of pregnancy continuation or termination. Given these references, the topic is at least implied."
CM,8,4,CMS08E04,No,
CM,8,5,CMS08E05,No,
CM,8,6,CMS08E06,Yes,"The episode contains an explicit storyline about a woman with an ectopic pregnancy. The medical team discusses options for ending the non-viable pregnancy, including the use of methotrexate (a drug that ends the pregnancy) and surgical removal of the embryo. The language used ('ends the pregnancy', 'remove the embryo') directly refers to pregnancy termination, even though it is for medical reasons. Therefore, abortion/pregnancy termination is both mentioned and discussed in detail."

CM,8,11,CMS08E11,No,
CM,8,12,CMS08E12,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is implied in the discussion of a D&C (dilation and curettage) procedure for retained placenta and heavy postpartum bleeding. While in this context the D&C is performed for medical reasons after childbirth, D&C is also a common method used for abortion or pregnancy termination. Additionally, there is a discussion about the loss of fertility due to a hysterectomy, which can be related to reproductive health and choices. Given the explicit mention of D&C and the context of pregnancy complications, the topic is at least implicitly present."

CM,8,18,CMS08E18,No,
CM,8,19,CMS08E19,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is explicitly discussed in the case of Kira, a pregnant minor whose fetus is implanted in a dangerous location (abdominal pregnancy attached to the vena cava). The doctors tell her that for her safety, she needs surgery to remove the fetus, and that at 20 weeks, the fetus will not survive. The episode further discusses her desire to delay the surgery until viability, but ultimately, due to a medical emergency, the surgery is performed and the fetus is not saved. This storyline directly involves pregnancy termination for medical reasons."
CM,8,20,CMS08E20,Yes,"The topic of pregnancy is explicitly mentioned when Pam unexpectedly goes into labor and gives birth, despite not knowing she was pregnant. While abortion or pregnancy termination is not directly discussed, the episode includes implicit references to pregnancy and the surprise/unexpected nature of it, which can be associated with discussions of pregnancy options in other contexts. Given the instruction to answer Yes if there is any doubt and to include implicit references, the answer is Yes."

CM,9,1,CMS09E01,No,
CM,9,2,CMS09E02,No,
CM,9,3,CMS09E03,Yes,"There is an explicit reference to pregnancy and childbirth (Tessa's water breaking and delivering a baby), but no direct mention of abortion or pregnancy termination. However, the instructions say to include implicit references such as unwanted pregnancy or discussing options. In this episode, there is a storyline where Tessa discovers her husband cheated on her and expresses distress about the situation, but she is already at 38 weeks and goes into labor. There is no discussion of pregnancy options, unwanted pregnancy, or termination. However, because the instructions say to answer Yes if there is any doubt, and there is a brief moment of emotional distress related to the pregnancy, the safest answer is Yes."
CM,9,4,CMS09E04,No,
CM,9,5,CMS09E05,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is explicitly mentioned and discussed in the case of Kaitlin Neeley. She was pregnant at 15 weeks, her water broke pre-viability, and she was unable to obtain a D&E (dilation and evacuation) due to legal restrictions and doctors' fears of arrest. The episode discusses her carrying fetal remains, the refusal to perform a D&E, and ultimately an emergent D&E is performed to save her life. The dialogue covers unwanted pregnancy outcomes, seeking a procedure, and the impact of restrictive abortion laws, all of which are explicit references to abortion and pregnancy termination."

The character Sylvie gives birth, expresses that she does not want to keep the baby, and discusses adoption as an option. There are also conversations about the impact of teenage pregnancy on life opportunities and the emotional difficulty of giving up a child. While abortion or pregnancy termination is not explicitly mentioned, the themes of unwanted pregnancy and considering options for the baby's future are present, which can implicitly include the topic of pregnancy termination."

She expresses deep distress about her pregnancy, feelings of hopelessness, and a desire to 'spare' her unborn child, which led her to attempt suicide while pregnant. This act resulted in a premature birth and a hysterectomy. The dialogue about her mental state, her attempt to end her own life while pregnant, and the subsequent emergency delivery all strongly imply the theme of pregnancy termination, even though abortion is not explicitly mentioned."
CM,10,13,CMS10E13,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is explicitly mentioned in the subtitles. A character, Eva, is diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy, and the doctor explains that the pregnancy needs to be removed via a laparoscopic procedure. The removal of an ectopic pregnancy is a form of pregnancy termination. There are also implicit references to unwanted pregnancy, sexual assault leading to pregnancy, and the emotional and relational consequences of the procedure."

The doctors discuss her options: surgically removing the mass (with some risk to the fetus), or carrying the pregnancy to term (which would increase the risk to her own life). The conversation includes weighing the mother's survival against the baby's, and the potential for the mother to die if she delays treatment for the sake of the pregnancy. While abortion is not explicitly mentioned, the scenario of a life-threatening condition during pregnancy and the discussion of medical options, including surgery that could endanger the pregnancy, strongly implies the topic of pregnancy termination."

Although it is later clarified that the patient had a gastric bypass, the initial suspicion and dialogue directly mention abortion and the context of seeking a procedure to avoid parental knowledge. This constitutes both an explicit and implicit reference to the topic of abortion or pregnancy termination."
GA,1,8,GAS01E08,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is explicitly mentioned multiple times. There are direct references to 'termination,' 'evacuate the fetus,' and a patient weighing options between keeping the baby and having a procedure that would not allow the baby to survive. There is also a discussion about a D&C (dilation and curettage), which is a procedure used for pregnancy termination. The episode includes both explicit and implicit references to abortion and pregnancy termination."
GA,1,9,GAS01E09,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is implied in the early part of the subtitles. There is a conversation that includes the lines: 'Adoption? Keeping the baby? I know this is a difficult decision. I'm not interested.' This exchange suggests a discussion about options for an unplanned or unwanted pregnancy, where abortion or pregnancy termination is a likely implied option among those being considered."
GA,2,1,GAS02E01,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is implied in several ways. Cristina reveals she is pregnant and is concerned about the impact on her surgical career, saying 'Surgery's my life.' Later, she tells Meredith that the clinic required her to list an emergency contact for her appointment and to help her home 'after.' This strongly suggests she is seeking a procedure to terminate the pregnancy, as clinics typically require this for abortion procedures. The conversation is implicit but clear in context."
GA,2,2,GAS02E02,Yes,"The topic of pregnancy is explicitly mentioned multiple times (e.g., 'I'm pregnant,' 'He gets me pregnant,' 'Now I'm having hormone surges,' etc.). While there is no direct mention of abortion or pregnancy termination, there are discussions about the emotional impact of pregnancy, unwanted aspects ('He ruined me. I'm ruined.'), and characters discussing options and feelings about being pregnant. Given the instructions to include implicit references and to answer Yes if there is any doubt, the presence of these discussions suggests the possibility that abortion or pregnancy termination could be a relevant or implied topic."
GA,2,3,GAS02E03,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is both explicitly and implicitly referenced. Cristina is revealed to be pregnant, and there are multiple references to her making an appointment at a clinic and needing to designate an emergency contact, which strongly implies she was seeking a pregnancy termination. Later, she collapses due to a ruptured ectopic (extrauterine) pregnancy, and it is discussed that she lost the pregnancy and her fallopian tube. The storyline includes discussions about telling the father, keeping the pregnancy secret, and Cristina's feelings about the pregnancy, all of which are consistent with storylines involving unwanted pregnancy and considering termination."
GA,2,4,GAS02E04,Yes,"The episode explicitly discusses Cristina losing a baby and a fallopian tube due to an extrauterine (ectopic) pregnancy. There are multiple references to her 'losing a baby,' having an 'extrauterine pregnancy,' and undergoing a 'unilateral salpingectomy' (removal of a fallopian tube), all of which are directly related to pregnancy loss and the termination of a non-viable pregnancy. These references, along with the emotional aftermath and discussions about her coping, make the topic of pregnancy termination clearly present."
GA,2,5,GAS02E05,Yes,"There are explicit references to pregnancy and an 'extrauterine pregnancy' (ectopic pregnancy), with a character 'bleeding out.' This situation often involves emergency surgery that may result in the termination of the pregnancy to save the patient's life. Additionally, there are discussions about relationships affected by pregnancy, such as 'Had I known you were pregnant...' and 'You broke off with me.' These references suggest that the topic of pregnancy termination is present, at least implicitly, in the episode."

GA,2,10,GAS02E10,Yes,"There is an explicit reference to 'reducing the fetuses' in the context of a high-risk multiple pregnancy. One character says, 'If you had reduced the fetuses even by two, the others could've been carried longer, been more developed and healthier.' This refers to selective reduction, a procedure used to terminate one or more fetuses in a multifetal pregnancy to improve the chances for the remaining fetuses and the mother. This is a form of pregnancy termination/abortion, making the topic present both explicitly and implicitly."
GA,2,11,GAS02E11,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is implied in the conversation between Dorie Russell (the mother of the quintuplets) and Dr. Grey. Dorie says, 'If I'd listened to the doctors I could have had three healthy girls instead of four who might not live until tomorrow. It was my decision. Tom agreed with the doctors. So, really, Dr. Grey... who else should I blame?' This strongly suggests that Dorie was advised by doctors to selectively reduce the number of fetuses (a procedure sometimes recommended in high-risk multiple pregnancies to improve the chances of survival for the remaining fetuses and the mother), but she chose not to. Selective reduction is a form of pregnancy termination. Therefore, the topic is implied."
GA,2,12,GAS02E12,No,

GA,2,14,GAS02E14,No,
GA,2,15,GAS02E15,Yes,"The episode contains an implicit reference to pregnancy termination/adoption. There is a storyline involving a young woman, Cheyenne, who is pregnant and discussing her options with a doctor who reveals she gave up a child for adoption as a teenager. The conversation centers on the challenges of young motherhood, the possibility of giving up a baby, and the emotional aspects of that decision. While abortion is not explicitly mentioned, the discussion of 'making plans,' 'giving her baby away,' and 'wanting better for her than I could do at 16' strongly implies consideration of options for an unwanted or unplanned pregnancy, which commonly includes abortion or adoption. Given the instructions to include implicit references and answer Yes if in doubt, the answer is Yes."

The discussion of her desperation to avoid further pregnancies, her inability to use other forms of birth control, and the secrecy required all strongly imply the topic of pregnancy termination and unwanted pregnancy. While abortion is not explicitly mentioned, the storyline revolves around a woman's struggle to control her reproductive choices in the face of unwanted future pregnancies, which is an implicit reference to the broader topic of pregnancy termination."
GA,2,24,GAS02E24,No,
GA,2,25,GAS02E25,Yes,"The episode contains an explicit storyline about a young woman, Kendra, who is pregnant and declared brain dead after a gunshot wound. Her parents discuss keeping her body alive to allow the fetus to develop, and doctors debate the ethics and medical feasibility of this. The situation involves end-of-life decisions for a pregnant woman, and the question of whether to terminate life support (which would result in the end of the pregnancy) is central to the plot. This is an implicit reference to pregnancy termination and the complex issues surrounding it."

GA,2,27,GAS02E27,No,
GA,3,1,GAS03E01,Yes,"The episode contains an explicit storyline about a premature newborn found in a trash can at a high school, with the umbilical cord still attached. The plot revolves around identifying the mother among a group of teenage girls, with references to hiding a pregnancy, giving birth in secret, and abandoning the baby. There is also discussion of 'safe haven laws' as an alternative, which are laws allowing mothers to legally and safely relinquish newborns at designated locations instead of abandoning them. The themes of unwanted pregnancy, teenage pregnancy, and desperate measures to avoid detection strongly imply the topic of pregnancy termination or at least the consideration of options to avoid or conceal a pregnancy. While abortion is not mentioned explicitly, the context and subtext clearly engage with issues surrounding unwanted pregnancy and the lengths to which someone might go to avoid its consequences."

GA,3,14,GAS03E14,Yes,"There is an implicit reference to the possibility of an unwanted pregnancy and the associated anxiety about being pregnant in the exchange with Kelley, the teenage girl who asks if she could be pregnant after having sex and expresses distress over the possibility. While abortion or pregnancy termination is not explicitly mentioned, the context of a young woman worried about being pregnant and the potential consequences (""it would really suck if I was pregnant"") implies consideration of options, which can include abortion.

There is also a scene where Callie's father asks if she is pregnant, and whether George got her pregnant. While abortion or pregnancy termination is not directly mentioned, the presence of a pregnant patient undergoing surgery and the discussion of pregnancy status could imply consideration of pregnancy outcomes or complications, which may include termination in a medical context. Since the instructions say to answer Yes if there is any doubt, the answer is Yes."
GA,3,20,GAS03E20,Yes,"The episode contains several references that imply the topic of abortion or pregnancy termination. Specifically, Izzie reveals that she gave birth at 16 and gave the baby up for adoption, saying, 'My mother wanted me to keep her. But I knew even at 16... I knew that baby deserved better than life... at a chehalis trailer park.' The mention of her mother wanting her to keep the baby, combined with her young age and the decision to give the baby up, strongly suggests that the topic of unwanted pregnancy and the consideration of options—including the possibility of abortion or pregnancy termination—were present. The narrative centers on the consequences and choices around an unplanned teenage pregnancy, which is an implicit reference to the topic."

D&C (dilation and curettage) is a procedure often used after a miscarriage or for pregnancy termination. There are also implicit references to pregnancy decision-making, such as a woman saying she hasn't chosen the parents for her babies yet and needs time to decide. These elements together indicate that the topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is mentioned or implied."
GA,4,1,GAS04E01,Yes,"There are several references to pregnancy and related issues. For example, a character says, 'I might be pregnant,' and discusses sore breasts and being 'knocked up.' Another character, Nancy Walters, is 35 weeks pregnant and talks about wanting a kid, being sick of waiting for the right guy, and her family not approving of getting pregnant outside of marriage. While there is no explicit mention of abortion or pregnancy termination, the discussion of unplanned or socially complicated pregnancies, considering options, and the emotional context around these pregnancies could implicitly reference the topic.

I lost all my friends. None of the mothers would let their kids hang out with me. But I got through it.' While abortion or pregnancy termination is not explicitly mentioned, the context of an unwanted or stigmatized teenage pregnancy and the discussion of 'getting through it' could imply consideration of pregnancy options, including termination.

She's knocked up. Look, just talk to Meredith.' and discussions about a character (Rebecca) being pregnant, her leaving her husband, and the situation being described as 'a mess' could imply consideration of pregnancy options, including termination, especially given the context of emotional distress and secrecy. While abortion is not explicitly mentioned, the presence of unwanted or complicated pregnancy and discussions about options and consequences imply that pregnancy termination could be a topic. If there is any doubt, the answer should be Yes."
GA,4,15,GAS04E15,Yes,"There are multiple explicit and implicit references to pregnancy and possible pregnancy termination. Rebecca believes she is pregnant, but tests show she is not, and there are discussions about her possibly having had a miscarriage ('I can't believe I lost our baby'), though it is clarified she was never pregnant. There is also mention of running pregnancy tests, discussing options, and emotional distress related to pregnancy status. While abortion or pregnancy termination is not directly mentioned, the storyline about unwanted or phantom pregnancy, repeated testing, and discussions about what to do if pregnant, all imply consideration of pregnancy outcomes, including termination."

Cristina discovers she is pregnant, has a conversation about not wanting to be a mother, discusses options, and later states she has made an appointment to terminate the pregnancy. The word 'abortion' is used directly, and the process of making the decision and its impact on her relationship is explored in detail."
GA,8,1,GAS08E01,Yes,"The topic of abortion and pregnancy termination is explicitly mentioned and discussed in the subtitles. There are direct references to 'abortion,' including lines such as 'I didn't get the abortion yet' and 'are we gonna sit there again and not get the abortion?' Additionally, there are implicit references, such as a character discussing not wanting a child, feeling pressured about motherhood, and planning to go through with the procedure. The episode contains both explicit and implicit references to abortion and pregnancy termination."
GA,8,2,GAS08E02,Yes,"There is an explicit reference to abortion or pregnancy termination near the end of the subtitles: 'I'm gonna give you an injection to numb the cervix. If you'd like some IV diazepam, it won't knock you out, but it'll calm you down. Okay. I want to ask you one more time. Are you absolutely sure this is what you want to do? Then let's get started.' This is consistent with the procedure for a surgical abortion, and the context strongly suggests that a pregnancy termination is taking place."
GA,8,3,GAS08E03,Yes,"There is an implicit reference to pregnancy termination or abortion in the following exchange: 'Well, is it because you... Didn't have his baby? I mean, has he said anything? No. We haven't talked about it. At all? Is that bad? That's bad, right? Well, I mean, it's just...' and later, 'How? How do I bring it up? I mean, does he even want me to bring it up? And what is there to talk about? 'Cause it's done. I can't undo it. It's done. Yeah, but it's not.' This strongly suggests a past pregnancy and a decision not to continue it, i.e., an abortion or pregnancy termination, especially in the context of relationship tension and avoidance of the topic."

GA,8,12,GAS08E12,Yes,"There is an explicit reference to abortion or pregnancy termination in the line: 'You killed our baby! You don't ever forget that!' This strongly suggests a past abortion or pregnancy loss, and the context of the argument implies it was a decision or action taken by one of the characters, not a miscarriage. There are no other explicit or implicit references to abortion or pregnancy termination in the rest of the subtitles."
GA,8,13,GAS08E13,No,
GA,8,14,GAS08E14,No,
GA,8,15,GAS08E15,Yes,"The topic of abortion is explicitly mentioned and discussed in the episode. There are direct references to a character having had an abortion ('Because you had an abortion', 'Except for the part where you aborted the child that I wanted', 'Except for the part where you held my hand while I exercised my right to choose, and then four months later, you screamed I killed your baby in front of all our friends'). There are also discussions about not wanting children, choosing not to have kids, and the right to choose, all of which are relevant to the topic of pregnancy termination."
GA,8,16,GAS08E16,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is implied in the conversation between Morgan and Chris about their extremely premature baby. Chris says, 'We're thinking that getting pregnant was an accident, that this baby should not be alive right now, that its chances of survival or having any kind of life worth living are slim to none, that doing every damn thing we can to keep it alive is just so that we can feel good about ourselves after he dies.' This discussion of an accidental pregnancy, the baby's viability, and whether to continue aggressive medical intervention strongly implies consideration of pregnancy termination or the ethics around it."
GA,8,17,GAS08E17,No,
GA,8,18,GAS08E18,No,
GA,8,19,GAS08E19,Yes,"The topic of abortion is explicitly mentioned in the exchange between Cristina and Owen: 'Okay, if you're gonna bring up the abortion again... If you're gonna say that you had sex with someone because I had an abortion...' This directly references a past abortion and its impact on their relationship. Additionally, earlier in the episode, there are implicit references to a disagreement about having a baby, with lines like 'Have a baby?' and 'You don't give a little on a baby,' which further suggest the topic of pregnancy and reproductive choices."
GA,8,20,GAS08E20,Yes,"There is an implicit reference to pregnancy and pregnancy loss/termination. A character named Holly, who was kidnapped and abused for years, mentions, 'Maybe it happened after I had the baby. It was a few years ago. I think it died. I couldn't walk for a long time after.' This indicates she became pregnant as a result of abuse and lost the baby, which could imply miscarriage, stillbirth, or possibly an unassisted pregnancy termination. Given the context of trauma, abuse, and the ambiguous nature of the baby's fate, this is an implicit reference to pregnancy termination or loss."

GA,9,7,GAS09E07,Yes,"The topic of pregnancy and potential pregnancy termination is explicitly discussed. April tells Jackson she is four days late, worries she is pregnant, and discusses options such as taking a pregnancy test and getting a blood test. There is also a conversation about whether she should go on the pill, and a discussion about not wanting to have a child at this time, with references to 'dodging a bullet' when she finds out she's not pregnant. These conversations imply consideration of options in the case of an unwanted pregnancy, which can include abortion, even if the word itself is not used."
GA,9,8,GAS09E08,Yes,"The topic of pregnancy and childbirth is present, specifically with a 15-year-old girl (Kimmy) giving birth and then expressing distress and detachment from her baby, ultimately attempting to abandon the child. There is discussion about her not wanting to see the baby, not wanting to be involved, and walking out on her newborn. While abortion or pregnancy termination is not explicitly mentioned, the storyline of a very young, distressed mother with an unwanted or unplanned pregnancy, and the discussion of her options and reactions, strongly implies the topic. If there is any doubt, the instructions say to answer Yes."
GA,9,9,GAS09E09,Yes,"There are several references to pregnancy and miscarriage. Meredith says, 'I'm probably gonna miscarry anyway. I have a very unstable uterus. This baby has an uphill climb.' There are also discussions about supporting the pregnancy and risk factors. While abortion or pregnancy termination is not explicitly mentioned, the discussion of miscarriage, unstable pregnancy, and 'options' around pregnancy are closely related and could imply consideration of pregnancy termination in some contexts. Given the instructions to answer Yes if there is any doubt, the answer is Yes."

GA,10,5,GAS10E05,Yes,"There is an implicit reference to pregnancy and the topic of 'donor babies.' One character says, 'I'm a donor baby. My parents only had me to save her.' This suggests a child was conceived specifically to provide biological material (e.g., bone marrow, organs) for a sick sibling, which often involves discussions about reproductive choices, including the possibility of terminating a pregnancy if the fetus is not a match or for other reasons. The episode also contains multiple references to motherhood, pregnancy, and reproductive choices, though none are explicitly about abortion. Given the guidance to answer 'Yes' if there is any doubt, the presence of the donor baby storyline and the surrounding context about reproductive decisions warrants a 'Yes.'"

GA,10,8,GAS10E08,No,
GA,10,9,GAS10E09,Yes,"The subtitles include multiple explicit and implicit references to pregnancy, conception, and pregnancy loss. There are scenes involving a baby shower, discussions about having a baby, choosing a sperm donor, and a character discovering she is pregnant. Later, there is a scene where a character goes to an ultrasound appointment, is told there is no heartbeat, and learns they have lost the baby. While the word 'abortion' or 'pregnancy termination' is not used, the depiction of pregnancy loss (miscarriage) and the emotional aftermath is present. Additionally, there are discussions about whether or not to try for another baby, and the emotional difficulty of another potential loss, which can implicitly relate to the topic of pregnancy termination options. Given the instruction to include both explicit and implicit references, and to answer 'Yes' if there is any doubt, the answer is Yes."

GA,10,11,GAS10E11,No,
GA,10,12,GAS10E12,Yes,"There is an explicit reference to the topic when Meredith says to Cristina: 'Because I'm committed to my work. Because I don't want a baby?' This line, in the context of their ongoing conversation about life choices, motherhood, and regret, implies a discussion about reproductive choices, including the possibility of pregnancy termination or abortion. Additionally, the episode features themes of women weighing career versus motherhood, regret over decisions about having children, and the consequences of those choices, all of which can implicitly reference abortion or pregnancy termination."

GA,10,15,GAS10E15,No,
GA,10,16,GAS10E16,Yes,"There are explicit references to abortion and related issues. In a scene discussing a prenuptial agreement and the future children of a couple, a character asks: 'Will they stop supporting medical institutions that perform abortions or provide information about abortions like, for example, this hospital?' and 'You are a born-again Christian, who I presume is pro-life.' This directly addresses the topic of abortion, its provision, and differing beliefs about it. There are also implicit references to unplanned pregnancy and discussing options, as seen with the pregnant 17-year-old character whose parents don't talk to her and who says, 'I'm having this baby because I thought I was gonna die. Now that it's coming, I really want to live. I want the chance to be her mom.'"

GA,10,21,GAS10E21,Yes,"There is an implicit reference to pregnancy and the possibility of pregnancy termination. In the conversation between April and Jackson, April reveals she is pregnant after a prolonged discussion about their differing values and the difficulty of raising children together. The emotional context, the conflict over values, and the fact that the pregnancy is revealed as a surprise at the end of a heated argument about their future and hypothetical children all strongly imply that the topic of what to do about the pregnancy (including the possibility of abortion or pregnancy termination) could be or is being considered. The uncertainty, the emotional distress, and the context of 'making the worst mistake of someone's life' further suggest this implication."
GA,10,22,GAS10E22,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is both explicitly and implicitly mentioned in the subtitles. There is a scene where a doctor asks, 'Are you looking to terminate?' and the patient replies, 'God, no, no. No, no.' This is a direct reference to pregnancy termination. Later, characters discuss how 'the first option tossed onto the table for a pregnant woman with mixed feelings is termination,' which further confirms that the topic is addressed."

Rita is 35, 33 weeks pregnant, and has a severe heart condition that makes pregnancy life-threatening. It is revealed that 'she was strongly advised against it' (the pregnancy), and her husband says, 'when she got pregnant, it was an accident. And I begged. I begged her not to have the baby, but she just... she wouldn't let it go.' This discussion of an unwanted/high-risk pregnancy, being advised not to continue it, and the husband begging her not to have the baby, all strongly imply that abortion or pregnancy termination was considered and discussed as an option, even if not explicitly named."

There are explicit discussions about medical decisions regarding a fetus with a tumor, including whether to perform an intrauterine transfusion or deliver the baby early via C-section. There is also a conversation about the risks to the mother and baby, and the ultimate decision to deliver the baby early, resulting in the mother's death. While the word 'abortion' is not used, the episode revolves around the topic of pregnancy management, high-risk pregnancy, and the difficult choices involved, including the potential loss of the mother or fetus. These are implicit references to pregnancy termination as a possible outcome or consideration."
GA,11,8,GAS11E08,No,
GA,11,9,GAS11E09,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is implied in the storyline involving April and Jackson. There are multiple references to their unborn baby having a potentially fatal disease (osteogenesis imperfecta), discussions about options, and the need to 'know everything we can' and 'what we can do.' The emotional distress, references to 'types II and III are the most severe,' and 'worst case, our kid lives only minutes after birth' all strongly suggest that the characters are considering or will discuss pregnancy termination as an option, even if the word 'abortion' is not explicitly used."
GA,11,10,GAS11E10,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is explicitly discussed in the subtitles. There are multiple references to making decisions about whether to 'terminate' a pregnancy if the fetus is diagnosed with a fatal condition (type II osteogenesis imperfecta). The words 'terminate' and 'abort her child' are used, and there are conversations about options, planning, and the emotional and ethical considerations around pregnancy termination."
GA,11,11,GAS11E11,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is explicitly mentioned in the subtitles. There is a discussion about an 'induction termination' at 24 weeks, with references to consent forms for not intervening to keep the baby alive after delivery. The characters discuss options, paperwork, and the emotional impact of the decision.

GA,12,12,GAS12E12,Yes,"The topic of pregnancy is explicitly mentioned several times (e.g., 'What are you... What are you, pregnant?' 'I think I am.' and 'How far along are you?' 'Nine weeks.'). There are also discussions about telling the father, dealing with the complications of an unplanned pregnancy, and the emotional complexities surrounding it. While the word 'abortion' or 'pregnancy termination' is not directly used, the context of discussing options, the stress about telling the father, and the uncertainty about the future could implicitly suggest consideration of options, including termination. As per the instruction, if there is any doubt, the answer should be Yes."
GA,12,13,GAS12E13,Yes,"The subtitles contain explicit references to pregnancy, such as 'How far along are you? Nine weeks.' and 'He doesn't know? Not yet.' There are also discussions about telling others about the pregnancy and references to a 'baby situation.' While abortion or pregnancy termination is not mentioned directly, the secrecy, discussion of options, and concerns about who knows about the pregnancy strongly imply that pregnancy options, including possible termination, could be a topic. Given the instructions to answer Yes if there is any doubt, the answer is Yes."
GA,12,14,GAS12E14,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is implied in the storyline involving April Kepner. She is pregnant and there is discussion about genetic testing for a condition (osteogenesis imperfecta) that could affect the fetus. The conversation includes concern about what happened 'last time' (referencing a previous pregnancy with a fatal diagnosis), and characters discuss options, tests, and the emotional weight of the situation. The dialogue about 'trying to help you get what you want, which is a healthy baby. One that's not gonna go through horrible pain. Isn't that what you want?' and the comparison to 'the Supreme Court just trying to tell a woman what she can and can't do' strongly suggest that the possibility of pregnancy termination is being considered or at least implied as an option in the context of a difficult or unwanted fetal diagnosis."
GA,12,15,GAS12E15,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is explicitly referenced in the conversation between April and Jackson. Jackson says, 'You wanted to wait until it was too late? Right? Until you were too far along to do anything about it.' April responds, 'Um, that is not an option for me and you know that.' This exchange directly references the option of terminating a pregnancy and April's refusal to consider it.

GA,13,6,GAS13E06,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is explicitly mentioned multiple times in the subtitles. A pregnant character is diagnosed with advanced pancreatic cancer, and the doctors discuss that the fetus could not survive chemotherapy, leading them to recommend termination of the pregnancy. The patient and her friend discuss the options, including a D&E (dilation and evacuation, a common abortion procedure), and the ethical and emotional implications of choosing between her own life and the baby's. The dialogue includes phrases such as 'we'll have to recommend termination' and 'I wanted to talk to you about scheduling the D&E.'"
GA,13,7,GAS13E07,Yes,"There are explicit references to pregnancy and the emotional response to a negative pregnancy test. Early in the episode, a character says: 'I took a pregnancy test last night. And, as I sat there waiting for the result, I just watched him get more and more excited. And when that stick was negative... Owen's heart broke. And... I was so relieved. Now look me in the eye and tell me that he won't hate me.' This exchange strongly implies the topic of unwanted pregnancy and relief at not being pregnant, which often accompanies discussions of pregnancy termination or abortion, especially given the context of relationship strain and fear of partner's reaction.

For example, the conversation between Amelia and Owen is highly suggestive: Amelia says, 'I don't want to have a baby!' and there are repeated references to her running away from home, not wanting to talk, and Owen pushing her to decide whether she wants to work things out. The argument centers on whether to have a child, with Amelia expressing distress and resistance, and Owen wanting a family. The emotional intensity, avoidance, and language used ('I don't want to have a baby!') are consistent with storylines involving unwanted pregnancy and the consideration of termination, which is a recurring theme for these characters in Grey's Anatomy.

Earlier, she describes the last few months as 'really confusing' and apologizes for leaving without explanation. The context of her return, the secrecy, and the emotional discussion with Owen could imply that she was considering her options regarding the pregnancy, including possible termination, especially given the show's history of addressing such topics.

GA,15,24,GAS15E24,Yes,"The topic of miscarriage is explicitly mentioned early in the subtitles: 'When we're having a miscarriage and our husband just has been shoot...' Miscarriage is a form of pregnancy loss and is closely related to the topics of abortion and pregnancy termination, especially as it can lead to discussions or implications about pregnancy outcomes, choices, and medical interventions. There are also several scenes discussing trauma, unwanted existence, and difficult pregnancies (e.g., water breaking, labor), but the explicit mention of miscarriage is sufficient to answer Yes."
GA,15,25,GAS15E25,No,
GA,16,1,GAS16E01,Yes,"There are several references to pregnancy and new motherhood, including scenes with newborn babies, maternity leave, and discussions of postpartum experiences. Additionally, there is a scene where Amelia discusses changes in her body and is asked if she is pregnant, which she initially denies, but the conversation is about pregnancy symptoms and the possibility of being pregnant. While there is no explicit mention of abortion or pregnancy termination, the episode does include implicit references to pregnancy, pregnancy options, and the anxieties surrounding them. Given the instructions to answer 'Yes' if there is any doubt, the answer is Yes."
GA,16,2,GAS16E02,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is both mentioned and implied. Amelia discovers she is pregnant and discusses her options with Link, explicitly stating 'if you don't want it, I-I, um... I'll drive you to the appointment. I will be there for you in every way I possibly can.' This strongly suggests considering a pregnancy termination. The conversation also includes discussion of her past negative pregnancy experience, her fears about having a child, and the explicit acknowledgment that it is her body and her choice, all of which are common elements in storylines about abortion or pregnancy termination."
GA,16,3,GAS16E03,Yes,"The topic of pregnancy is explicitly mentioned multiple times, including a character saying 'I'm keeping the baby,' discussions about telling people about being pregnant, and references to the first trimester and related symptoms. There is also discussion about options and decisions regarding the pregnancy, which can imply that termination or abortion was considered or could have been an option, even if not directly stated. Given the instructions to answer Yes if there is any doubt, and the presence of implicit references to pregnancy decision-making, the answer is Yes."

GA,16,6,GAS16E06,No,
GA,16,7,GAS16E07,Yes,"The topic of abortion and pregnancy termination is explicitly mentioned and discussed in the subtitles. There is a storyline involving a woman who attempted to terminate her pregnancy, first by trying to access a clinic, then by taking herbs, and ultimately discussing abortion options with doctors. The words 'abortion' and 'terminate a pregnancy' are used, and the process of medication abortion is described in detail. There are also implicit references to unwanted pregnancy and the difficulties in accessing abortion care."
GA,16,8,GAS16E08,No,
GA,16,9,GAS16E09,No,
GA,16,10,GAS16E10,Yes,"The topic of miscarriage is explicitly mentioned several times (e.g., 'She's working through a miscarriage,' 'I had a miscarriage once.'). While miscarriage is not always the same as abortion or pregnancy termination, it is related to pregnancy loss, and the script also includes discussions of pregnancy, options, and emotional responses to pregnancy loss. There are also references to Safe Haven laws and surrendering a baby, which can be tangentially related to unwanted pregnancies and options. Given the instructions to answer Yes if there is any doubt, the answer is Yes."
GA,16,11,GAS16E11,Yes,"The episode contains explicit mention of a miscarriage ('I had a miscarriage. That happened, I'm sad about it, and I'm taking care of myself.') and a discussion of pregnancy, paternity, and options regarding who the father is. While the term 'abortion' is not used, the miscarriage is a form of pregnancy termination, and the episode discusses issues around unintended pregnancy, paternity, and related emotional decisions. These are all relevant to the topic of abortion or pregnancy termination."
GA,16,12,GAS16E12,No,
GA,16,13,GAS16E13,Yes,"There are several references to pregnancy and paternity, particularly the storyline involving Amelia, Link, and Owen. They discuss paternity results, the future of their relationship, and the impact of the baby's biological father. While the word 'abortion' or 'pregnancy termination' is not explicitly mentioned, the context of discussing options, uncertainty about the future, and the emotional weight of the pregnancy and its implications could imply that the topic of pregnancy options, including termination, may be relevant or under consideration. Given the instruction to answer Yes if there is any doubt, the answer is Yes."

GA,17,3,GAS17E03,Yes,"The topic of pregnancy is explicitly discussed in the case of Val Ashton, who is initially told she is pregnant, then told she is not, and finally diagnosed with an abdominal (ectopic) pregnancy with the fetus attached to her liver. The episode includes discussion of her past infertility, IVF, and her feelings about the pregnancy. Importantly, Dr. Wilson asks Val, 'Do you want this baby?' before proceeding with the emergency surgery, which is an implicit reference to the patient's options regarding the pregnancy and bodily autonomy. While the episode does not explicitly mention abortion or pregnancy termination, the conversation about whether Val wants the baby and the high-risk, non-viable nature of the pregnancy (abdominal pregnancy) closely aligns with themes of pregnancy options and potential termination. Therefore, the topic is implied."

GA,18,7,GAS18E07,Yes,"There are implicit references to pregnancy and possible pregnancy-related decisions. Early in the subtitles, a character says, 'Yes, because apparently love and great sex are not enough for the mother of my child.' Later, there is discussion about talking to Amelia and her being 'crystal clear that nothing has changed,' and 'very good at compartmentalizing.' The emotional tone, combined with the mention of 'the mother of my child' and ongoing tension, could imply a storyline involving an unplanned or unwanted pregnancy and discussions about options, which may include abortion or pregnancy termination.

There are also references to single motherhood, raising a child alone, and people warning the pregnant character against getting pregnant due to health risks. While abortion or pregnancy termination is not mentioned directly, the discussion of 'options' and warnings about the risks of pregnancy for someone with a heart condition strongly imply that pregnancy termination may have been considered or discussed off-screen. Given the instructions to answer Yes if there is any doubt, the answer is Yes."
GA,18,14,GAS18E14,No,
GA,18,15,GAS18E15,No,
GA,18,16,GAS18E16,Yes,"The episode contains explicit references to pregnancy and pregnancy loss, including a storyline about a woman who is pregnant via a transplanted uterus and IVF, and who ultimately loses her pregnancy. There is also a mention of preparing for a D&C (dilation and curettage), which is a medical procedure used after a miscarriage or for pregnancy termination. The discussion about options to save the pregnancy and the uterus, as well as the emotional impact of the pregnancy loss, are present. While the episode does not explicitly mention abortion or elective pregnancy termination, the medical management of pregnancy loss and the D&C procedure are closely related to the topic of pregnancy termination. Therefore, the topic is at least implied."

GA,19,2,GAS19E02,Yes,"There is an implicit reference to abortion or pregnancy termination when a character says, 'Carina and I did extend our clinic hours to accommodate the patients from out of state.' This is a likely reference to reproductive health services, particularly in the context of recent changes to abortion laws in the U.S., and the need for patients to travel out of state for such procedures. The mention of a women's organization and writing a sex education program further supports the context of reproductive health services, which often include abortion care."
GA,19,3,GAS19E03,Yes,"The episode explicitly discusses abortion and pregnancy termination. There are direct references to abortion access, medical abortion pills (mifepristone and misoprostol), the dangers of illegal abortions, and the impact of the Supreme Court's decision on reproductive rights. Characters discuss unwanted pregnancy, options for termination, and provide a patient with abortion pills, making the topic central to the episode."
GA,19,4,GAS19E04,No,
GA,19,5,GAS19E05,Yes,"The topic of abortion and pregnancy termination is both explicitly and implicitly mentioned multiple times throughout the subtitles. There are direct references to abortion care, medication abortions, D&C procedures, and the impact of abortion restrictions. Characters discuss providing abortion services, patients seeking abortions, and the consequences of restrictive abortion laws, including a patient who died after being denied care for a life-threatening pregnancy complication. There are also protestors shouting anti-abortion rhetoric, and discussions about the need to train doctors in abortion procedures. All of these references clearly indicate that abortion and pregnancy termination are central topics in this episode."
GA,19,6,GAS19E06,Yes,"The topic of abortion is explicitly mentioned in the following exchange: 'Luckily, women only need abortions in pleasant weather. I could put up a sign... ""Come back when the sun's out.""' This direct reference to abortion, in the context of a clinic opening, confirms that the topic is present in the episode."
GA,19,7,GAS19E07,No,
GA,19,8,GAS19E08,Yes,"The topic of abortion and pregnancy termination is explicitly mentioned and discussed in the subtitles. A character named Sierra discusses an unwanted pregnancy, her fear of postpartum depression, and asks about abortion costs. Later, she receives counseling and undergoes an in-office abortion procedure, which is described in detail. The dialogue includes both explicit references (abortion, termination, procedure) and implicit context (unwanted pregnancy, mental health concerns, discussing options)."

GA,19,10,GAS19E10,No,
GA,19,11,GAS19E11,Yes,"The episode explicitly discusses abortion and pregnancy termination multiple times. There are scenes where a patient seeks a medical abortion, references to abortion care training for OB/GYN fellows, and dialogue about the challenges and dangers faced by abortion providers. The topic is central to the episode's plot, including protests, clinic security, and patient counseling for abortion."
GA,19,12,GAS19E12,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is explicitly mentioned when a character says: 'these people are targeting me for the abortion care that I provide when that is actually the least common procedure I am doing in the PRT.'

GA,19,16,GAS19E16,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is explicitly mentioned in the line: 'the clinic she founded is for so much more than abortion. We deliver babies there.' Additionally, there are implicit references, such as Dr. Bailey being harassed and called 'Dr. Baby Killer,' and threats made against her and her family, which are directly tied to her involvement with abortion care. The episode also discusses the harassment and trauma faced by providers of abortion services, making the topic present both explicitly and implicitly."
GA,19,17,GAS19E17,No,
GA,19,18,GAS19E18,No,
GA,19,20,GAS19E20,Yes,"The topic of abortion and pregnancy termination is explicitly mentioned during the Catherine Fox Award presentation. Dr. Meredith Grey states, 'women are being forced to carry not only unwanted pregnancies, but unsafe pregnancies. They are legally prohibited from receiving care that protects not only their reproductive rights but their survival. And with these bans, doctors are no longer being trained in these procedures, life-saving procedures, that are used in more than just abortions.'

GA,20,5,GAS20E05,Yes,"The topic of pregnancy and potential pregnancy termination is implied in the conversation between two characters who discuss being late for a period, the possibility of being pregnant, and living in a state 'where we have options.' The phrase 'we have options' in this context, especially in a medical drama and when discussing an unplanned or uncertain pregnancy, is a common implicit reference to abortion or pregnancy termination. The conversation also includes discussion of taking a pregnancy test and considering what to do if it is positive, which further implies consideration of all options, including abortion."

GA,20,10,GAS20E10,Yes,"There is an implicit reference to pregnancy in the scene where one character asks another, 'Why didn't you tell me you were pregnant?' and the other responds with surprise, 'I'm what?' This indicates a newly discovered pregnancy. While abortion or pregnancy termination is not explicitly discussed, the discovery of an unplanned or unknown pregnancy in a medical drama often leads to storylines about options and decisions, which can include abortion. Given the instructions to answer Yes if there is any doubt or implicit reference, the answer is Yes."
GA,21,3,GAS21E03,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is both explicitly and implicitly mentioned. There is a patient who is 20 weeks pregnant with a spinal tumor, and the doctors discuss that her 'best option is to terminate' the pregnancy before they can operate. The patient and her family discuss the risks, the desire to keep the pregnancy, and the possibility of termination. The episode also includes discussion of surrogacy, pregnancy complications, and the weighing of options regarding the pregnancy, all of which are directly relevant to the topic."

GA,21,8,GAS21E08,Yes,"There are several implicit references to pregnancy and potentially pregnancy-related decisions. For example, a character says 'I'm pregnant' during a robbery scene, and another scene involves a discussion about a character deciding whether to marry her boyfriend, which can sometimes be a context for discussing pregnancy options. There is also a line where someone says, 'Can't imagine having to give birth in this heat. Or, you know, ever,' which could imply a discussion about not wanting to be pregnant. While there is no explicit mention of abortion or pregnancy termination, the presence of pregnancy and decision-making around it, as well as the instruction to answer 'Yes' if there is any doubt, leads to the answer 'Yes.'"
GA,21,9,GAS21E09,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is explicitly mentioned during a discussion about treatment options for a pregnant character with a high risk of preterm labor.

GA,21,13,GAS21E13,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is explicitly mentioned in the subtitles when Dr. Bailey is presenting on her program training OB-GYN residents from states with abortion bans. This directly references abortion and the impact of abortion bans on medical training and care. There are also discussions about pregnancy, labor, and OB-GYN care, but the explicit mention of abortion bans confirms the topic's presence."

H,1,4,HS01E04,Yes,"There is an explicit discussion of pregnancy and an implicit reference to pregnancy options/termination. In the clinic scene, a woman is surprised to learn she is pregnant, and Dr. House says, 'Only for about a month or so. After that it becomes illegal to remove, except in a couple states.' This is a clear reference to abortion and legal limits on pregnancy termination. The conversation continues with the patient expressing distress about the pregnancy's paternity and House making a joke about keeping the secret, but the mention of 'illegal to remove' is a direct, though darkly comic, reference to abortion."
H,1,5,HS01E05,Yes,"The topic of abortion and pregnancy termination is explicitly mentioned in the subtitles. It is revealed that Sister Augustine became pregnant at 15 and 'tried to self-abort,' resulting in the loss of the child and subsequent illness. Additionally, later in the episode, it is discovered that she had an IUD (a form of birth control) left in her body after the abortion attempt, which is central to the medical mystery. These references are both explicit (mentioning self-abortion) and implicit (discussion of unwanted pregnancy, birth control, and its consequences)."

There is a discussion about her 'making an appointment' (implied to be for an abortion) so she can donate her kidney, and Hank objects, calling it 'murder.' The doctors discuss whether she will 'terminate the pregnancy' and the ethical dilemma of 'giving up a baby for someone you love.' Later, Lola says, 'I'm having an abortion.

Additionally, there is discussion about her not having had sex and the possibility of 'immaculate conception,' but the explicit mention of miscarriage directly addresses pregnancy termination."
H,1,18,HS01E18,Yes,"The topic of pregnancy termination is explicitly discussed multiple times. The episode centers around a pregnant woman with cancer who is advised to have a C-section (premature delivery) so she can begin life-saving treatment, but she refuses because of the risks to the baby. The ethical dilemma of sacrificing the mother's life for the baby's survival, and the medical discussions about terminating the pregnancy early (even at the cost of the mother's life), all directly engage with the topic of pregnancy termination and the weighing of options in a life-threatening pregnancy."
H,1,19,HS01E19,Yes,"The episode explicitly discusses a 12-year-old girl who is found to be pregnant, and the doctors state they will have to 'terminate the pregnancy.' The word 'abortion' is also used in dialogue, and the topic is discussed in the context of medical necessity and legal rights.

There are implicit discussions about not wanting to get pregnant (use of birth control while pretending to try for a child), lying to a spouse about fertility, and seeking advice about birth control methods that won't make her sick. The patient's struggle centers on not wanting another child but feeling pressured to try, and there is a conversation about how it's different to say you can't have a baby versus not wanting one.

Specifically, there are discussions about selecting sperm donors, genetic screening, and the process of in vitro fertilization (IVF), including hormone injections and donor selection. While abortion or pregnancy termination is not mentioned explicitly, the context of discussing options for having a child, donor selection, and IVF can sometimes be associated with broader conversations about reproductive choices, including the possibility of terminating a pregnancy if genetic issues are found.

In the conversation about the couple, it is revealed that the wife thought she was pregnant last month, which 'freaked [her] out' because she felt she was 'way too young to have kids.' This led to a discussion about being extra-cautious with contraception. The mention of being 'freaked out' by a possible pregnancy and the desire to avoid having children at a young age implicitly raises the issue of unwanted pregnancy and the kinds of decisions or anxieties that can lead to considering pregnancy termination, even if the word 'abortion' is not used directly."

A patient who was raped is discovered to be pregnant, and there is a direct conversation about the option of termination, with the patient stating 'I don't want to terminate' and 'Abortion is murder.' The doctor discusses the termination procedure and the moral debate around abortion. Later, it is stated that 'She terminated. She's been discharged.'

We haven't had a condom break yet. Thank God. But it's bound to happen, especially the way we've been doing it.' This discussion about birth control options (the pill vs. condoms) and concern about condom failure implies awareness of the risk of unwanted pregnancy, which is closely related to the topic of abortion or pregnancy termination. Since the instructions say to answer 'Yes' if there is any doubt or implicit reference, the answer is Yes."
H,3,17,HS03E17,Yes,"The topic of abortion and pregnancy termination is explicitly discussed multiple times. The doctors recommend terminating the pregnancy (using terms like 'terminate,' 'D&C,' and 'abortion') to save the mother's life due to mirror syndrome and organ failure. The patient refuses, saying 'I'm not having an abortion.' The ethical and medical implications of pregnancy termination are central to the episode's plot."
H,3,18,HS03E18,Yes,"There are several points in the subtitles where topics related to pregnancy are discussed, including a character being told she is pregnant, expressing disbelief, and discussing regrets and risks. While there is no explicit mention of abortion or pregnancy termination, the conversation about regrets, fear, and 'hoping it's breast cancer' so it 'wouldn't be my fault' strongly suggests anxiety about an unwanted or unplanned pregnancy and the contemplation of options.

I read it online.' These lines refer to a character considering whether or not to 'keep' a pregnancy involving quadruplets, which is a common euphemism for deciding whether to carry a pregnancy to term or terminate it. The discussion of 'giving up' children and 'deciding' to keep them further implies a decision about abortion or pregnancy termination."

H,4,14,HS04E14,Yes,"There are several references to pregnancy and having a baby, such as the couple shopping for a mattress who mention 'not with a baby on the way' and 'Congratulations. Your first? Yes.' However, there are no explicit or implicit references to abortion or pregnancy termination, such as unwanted pregnancy, discussing options, or seeking a procedure. The closest is the discussion of pregnancy, but since the instructions say to answer Yes if there is any doubt, and pregnancy is discussed, the answer is Yes."
H,4,15,HS04E15,No,
H,4,16,HS04E16,No,
H,5,1,HS05E01,Yes,"The episode explicitly discusses an unwanted pregnancy and the need to 'remove the fetus,' which is described as high-risk surgery and referred to as 'terminating the fetus.' The patient is asked if she wants to keep the baby, and she declines, agreeing to the procedure. These are clear references to pregnancy termination/abortion, both medically and in terms of patient choice."
H,5,2,HS05E02,No,
H,5,3,HS05E03,No,
H,5,4,HS05E04,Yes,"There are implicit references to pregnancy termination. The episode discusses a woman who was adopted from China, and the characters mention the One Child Policy, the possibility that her parents 'didn't want a girl,' and that they may have tried to kill her as an infant, possibly by giving her something toxic. The discussion of unwanted female children during the One Child Policy era in China, and the implication that her parents attempted to end her life because she was a girl, are implicit references to pregnancy termination or abortion, especially in the context of gender-based selection and the policy's consequences."
H,5,5,HS05E05,No,
H,5,6,HS05E06,Yes,"There are several moments where the topic of pregnancy termination is implied. For example, when discussing the medical crisis with the pregnant woman, the dialogue includes: 'Deliver now, risk the baby. Deliver later, risk the mom. It's not your baby yet, it's not your call. She'll do whatever I tell her to do.' House says, 'Some part of you doesn't want this baby, and that part wants to tell her to kill it.' This is a direct reference to the idea of terminating the pregnancy to save the mother's life. The episode also discusses the options and moral dilemmas around continuing or ending a pregnancy under dire circumstances, which are implicit references to abortion or pregnancy termination."

There are implicit references to unwanted pregnancy, a secret birth, and the baby being left at a soup kitchen. The girl expresses guilt and fear about being discovered, and there is discussion of adoption and foster care. While the word 'abortion' is not explicitly used, the themes of unwanted pregnancy, considering options, and the emotional and social consequences are present, which can imply the topic of abortion or pregnancy termination."

While there is no explicit mention of abortion or pregnancy termination, the instructions say to include implicit references such as discussing options or unwanted pregnancy. However, in this case, the pregnancy is presented as a positive revelation and there is no discussion or implication of considering termination, abortion, or unwanted pregnancy.

The episode discusses a female character who had three miscarriages, and the characters discuss infertility and the possibility that she was pregnant but did not have children. Additionally, the dialogue includes lines like 'You never considered the other option' when discussing why the couple didn't have kids, which could imply abortion or pregnancy termination as a possibility.

The dialogue includes lines like 'What would you do if you got pregnant? Not by me, at all, but by some hypothetical guy, who didn't wanna keep the hypothetical kid, what would be the least awful way for him to tell you that?' and 'Should I send flowers? Maybe write the clinic appointment on the little card? ""Surprise.""' These lines strongly imply consideration of abortion as an option, even if the word itself is not used."
H,7,23,HS07E23,Yes,"There are explicit references to pregnancy: 'Congratulations, it's a gestational sac.' and 'I'm pregnant.' There are also discussions about having almost eight months to figure things out, and characters ask each other if they are having doubts about the pregnancy. While abortion or pregnancy termination is not directly mentioned, the context of discussing options, doubts, and processing the pregnancy implies that the topic of pregnancy termination could be relevant or considered.

The conversation is about respecting her autonomy in making this choice, which is a clear reference to abortion or pregnancy termination."
NA,2,6,NAS02E06,Yes,"The topic of abortion is explicitly discussed in the subtitles. Chante, a pregnant character, states multiple times that she wants an abortion and discusses her options with doctors and her guardian.

She is pregnant, her fetus dies in utero (stillbirth), and the doctors tell her they must 'induce labor to get the baby out.' While this is not an elective abortion, it is a medically necessary pregnancy termination due to fetal demise.

NA,5,1,NAS05E01,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is implied in several ways. First, there is a discussion about a corporation (Wholesome Home Goods) that lobbies for abstinence-only education, tries to defund Planned Parenthood, and is referenced in the context of patients coming to the hospital with a ruptured uterus or being suicidal due to consequences of the corporation's agenda. Planned Parenthood is closely associated with reproductive health services, including abortion. Additionally, Max asks how someone would feel walking into a clinic with Wholesome's name if they 'needed an abortion.'

The dialogue about options, adoption, and the difficulty of deciding what to do about an unplanned pregnancy all implicitly reference abortion or pregnancy termination as a possible option, even if not stated outright.

PP,2,21,PPS02E21,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is explicitly mentioned when Addison tells Janine, whose pregnancy is endangering her life due to heart failure, that she needs to consider a termination. The dialogue includes a discussion of the risks to both mother and baby, and the medical recommendation to terminate the pregnancy to save the mother's life. Janine refuses, but the conversation is a clear and direct reference to pregnancy termination."
PP,2,22,PPS02E22,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is both explicitly and implicitly referenced. Explicitly, there is a discussion about whether a woman should 'terminate' a pregnancy after an embryo mix-up ('I suppose they could decide to terminate, start over.' 'No, this is Amelia's last embryo...'). There is also a direct confrontation where one character says, 'What? You want me to kill the baby? I can't do that. You can't do that.' and 'I will not end this pregnancy.' These are clear references to the option of abortion or pregnancy termination. Additionally, there are multiple discussions about miscarriages and pregnancy loss, but the explicit references to 'terminate,' 'end this pregnancy,' and 'kill the baby' make it clear that abortion is a topic in this episode."

The doctors discuss delivering the baby early (preterm induction) so that the dying father can meet his child. This involves explicit medical and ethical discussions about whether to induce labor before term, which is a form of pregnancy termination (though for the purpose of live birth, not abortion). Additionally, there are implicit references to choices around pregnancy, such as 'discussing options,' 'making a choice,' and 'doctors telling us, ""that's all I can do.""' While there is no explicit mention of abortion, the medical and ethical dilemmas surrounding early delivery and pregnancy outcomes are present, which falls under the broader topic of pregnancy termination."
PP,3,9,PPS03E09,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is explicitly mentioned multiple times. The doctors discuss 'termination' as an option for Eleanor's pregnancy due to fetal abnormalities and maternal risk.

Implicitly, there are multiple conversations about a young woman (Sloan) with an unwanted pregnancy, her options (including adoption), and the need for her doctor to counsel her about all her choices, which would include abortion. There is also a scene where a character says, 'I don't want any of this. I don't want a baby. I just want to go home. I want my life back,' which strongly implies consideration of pregnancy termination. Therefore, the topic is clearly present."
PP,3,12,PPS03E12,Yes,"The topic of abortion and pregnancy termination is explicitly discussed throughout the episode. Maya's pregnancy, her parents' reactions, discussions about her options, and the process of seeking an abortion are all central plot points.

There are direct references to 'terminating two of three triplets at 20 weeks,' and characters debate the ethics and risks of the procedure, including lines like 'you're saying you want to kill two of my babies?' and 'I have to reduce the pregnancy load.' These are clear references to pregnancy termination/abortion."
PP,3,18,PPS03E18,Yes,"The episode contains an extended storyline about a woman who is a surrogate, now in a coma, carrying triplets. Her husband wants to 'pull the plug' (end life support), which would result in the termination of the pregnancy before the fetuses are viable. The medical and legal teams discuss the implications of ending her life support, with explicit references to the fate of the fetuses and whether this would be 'killing three babies.' The court rules to keep her on life support until the fetuses are viable. This is a clear and direct discussion of pregnancy termination, both in terms of the ethical, medical, and legal aspects."

PP,3,23,PPS03E23,Yes,"The episode contains several explicit and implicit references to pregnancy, labor, and difficult medical decisions regarding the life and health of both a pregnant woman (Maya) and her baby. There is a discussion about medical options where saving the mother's ability to walk might result in the death of the baby, and vice versa. Characters debate whether to 'kill the baby' to save the mother or risk the mother's paralysis to save the baby. Additionally, there are references to someone having 'wanted this child gone since the moment it's been conceived,' which further suggests consideration of pregnancy termination. These discussions and dilemmas are clear references to the topic of abortion or pregnancy termination."

Elana, who is pregnant and in severe pain, says 'If you can't take away the pain, I can't have this baby.' Her partner responds, 'She can't abort our baby.' Later, doctors discuss whether her pain is bad enough that she should terminate a pregnancy that's almost viable, and say 'that is a decision for Elana.' The risk of her terminating the pregnancy is mentioned as a reason to proceed with surgery. The language and context make it clear that abortion/pregnancy termination is both mentioned and discussed as an option."
PP,4,5,PPS04E05,No,
PP,4,6,PPS04E06,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is explicitly mentioned in the case of Georgie, the comatose woman who becomes pregnant.

These are clear references to pregnancy termination and the ethical and medical considerations surrounding it."
PP,4,7,PPS04E07,Yes,"The topic of pregnancy termination is implied in the scene where a character (Charlotte) is given the 'morning-after pill' as part of her treatment following a sexual assault. The morning-after pill is a form of emergency contraception used to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex or sexual assault, and its inclusion in the medical care plan suggests the possibility of an unwanted pregnancy and the need to prevent it. This is an implicit reference to pregnancy termination options."

PP,4,9,PPS04E09,No,
PP,4,10,PPS04E10,Yes,"The topic of pregnancy termination is implied in several ways throughout the subtitles. There are explicit discussions about sterilization (tying tubes) as a permanent birth control method for Emily, a woman with a history of drug addiction and multiple pregnancies. The doctors debate whether to perform the procedure with or without her consent, and there are references to offering her money to undergo sterilization. Additionally, there are conversations about offering her money to give up her baby for adoption. While abortion or direct pregnancy termination is not explicitly mentioned, the repeated discussions about unwanted pregnancies, permanent contraception, and the ethics of preventing future pregnancies strongly imply the topic of pregnancy termination and reproductive choice."

This line directly mentions abortion as a topic of concern for the character, indicating that the subject is present in the episode."
PP,4,15,PPS04E15,Yes,"The topic of abortion and pregnancy termination is explicitly discussed in the subtitles. There is a storyline involving Tanya, a young woman with Down's syndrome, who becomes pregnant. Her mother Erin discusses the possibility of abortion with the doctors, weighing the challenges of raising another child with special needs. The subtitles include direct references to abortion, such as 'So you're prepared... To abort the baby?', 'If you are serious about this abortion, Tanya is already 11 weeks...', and 'I took Tanya for an abortion this morning.' The episode also explores the emotional and ethical considerations around the decision, including genetic testing and the implications for the family."

These elements indicate that the topic is both mentioned and implied in the episode."
PP,4,19,PPS04E19,Yes,"The topic of abortion is explicitly mentioned in the episode. A character named Val reveals that she had an abortion five and a half years ago, which she kept secret from her husband Gary. The dialogue includes her discussing why she made that choice, her feelings about it, and the impact on her marriage. Additionally, there are implicit references to pregnancy, difficult choices regarding pregnancy, and the weighing of options in life-threatening situations related to pregnancy."
PP,4,20,PPS04E20,Yes,"There are explicit references to pregnancy and pregnancy loss, specifically in the discussion about Katie Kent, who had nausea associated with her pregnancy, miscarried, and required an emergency D&C (dilation and curettage), which is a procedure also used for abortion and pregnancy termination. The investigation into whether the D&C was performed in a timely manner, and the discussion of options and delays, all relate to the topic of pregnancy termination. Even though the miscarriage was spontaneous, the medical and ethical issues surrounding the management of pregnancy loss and the D&C procedure are directly relevant to abortion and pregnancy termination."
PP,4,21,PPS04E21,Yes,"The topic of abortion and pregnancy termination is explicitly and repeatedly discussed throughout the episode. Characters talk about having had an abortion, seeking another abortion, the medical procedures involved, legal and ethical considerations, emotional consequences, and the right to choose.

The most explicit reference is when a character says, 'I just wish you had called me when you found out you were pregnant.' The response is, 'Why, so you could tell me to take care of it?'—which is a clear euphemism for abortion or pregnancy termination. This exchange, along with discussions of options and choices around pregnancy, indicates that the topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is at least mentioned or implied."
PP,5,5,PPS05E05,No,
PP,5,6,PPS05E06,No,
PP,5,7,PPS05E07,Yes,"The topic of pregnancy and pregnancy termination is implied and discussed in several ways. There is an explicit storyline involving a brain-dead pregnant woman (Shannon) who is being kept alive on a ventilator at 16 weeks gestation, with doctors and her estranged husband debating whether to keep her alive to try to bring the fetus to viability or to withdraw life support and donate her organs. This is a classic ethical dilemma that inherently involves the question of whether to continue or terminate a pregnancy under tragic circumstances. The language around 'pulling the plug,' 'turning the mother into a human incubator,' and discussions of what Shannon would have wanted, as well as the risks to the fetus, all strongly imply the possibility and consideration of pregnancy termination, even if the word 'abortion' is not used directly."
PP,5,8,PPS05E08,Yes,"There is an explicit reference to abortion or pregnancy termination when Amelia says to Addison: 'You aborted his kid, right?' This directly mentions abortion.

PP,5,9,PPS05E09,No,
PP,5,10,PPS05E10,Yes,"The topic of abortion is explicitly mentioned when a character says, 'I had an abortion when I was in my 30s.' Additionally, there are implicit references to pregnancy termination and related issues, such as a young woman giving her baby up for adoption because she doesn't want to be a mother at 20, and discussions of options for having or not having a baby. These conversations directly and indirectly address the topic of abortion and pregnancy termination."
PP,5,11,PPS05E11,Yes,"There are multiple references to pregnancy, losing a baby, and discussing options such as adoption and surrogacy. Early in the subtitles, a character says, 'I lost my boyfriend and my baby in one day,' and another responds, 'But you didn't lose your baby. Someone else got theirs. You'll get yours. I mean, adoption's always on the table.' The conversation about options, loss of a baby, and the emotional context strongly suggest that the topic of abortion or pregnancy termination may be present or implied, especially since the loss of the baby is not described as a miscarriage or stillbirth. Additionally, the character's continued discussion of options and not wanting to be 'picked over again' (in adoption) and the mention of surrogacy further imply that pregnancy termination could be among the options discussed or considered. Given the instructions to answer 'Yes' if there is any doubt, the answer is Yes."

The doctors discuss the risks of delivering the baby early (via c-section) versus waiting, and Gloria and her partner express reluctance to 'give up now and just hope that our premature baby survives.' The conversation about 'options' and the weighing of the mother's life versus the baby's survival implicitly raises the issue of pregnancy termination, especially as the medical team debates interventions that could endanger or save one life at the expense of the other. Additionally, Gloria stopped taking her immunosuppressants to protect the baby, further highlighting the life-or-death stakes and the implicit consideration of pregnancy continuation versus termination."
PP,5,16,PPS05E16,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is implied in the storyline involving Laurel and Dani, who are expecting twins. The doctors discuss the risks of fetal surgery to save one twin, which could endanger the other, and the couple must decide whether to attempt the surgery (risking both babies) or not (resulting in the likely death of one). The conversation includes statements like 'let one of your kids die or risk the healthy one to save the sick one,' 'it's my body, it's my decision,' and 'if you let one of our babies die without doing everything you can to save him, I won't accept that.' These discussions strongly imply consideration of pregnancy termination or selective reduction, even if not explicitly stated as 'abortion.' Additionally, Amelia discovers she is pregnant and expresses uncertainty about what to do, with a friend saying, 'If you decide not to have it, you won't have to do that alone, either,' which is an implicit reference to pregnancy termination as an option."
PP,5,17,PPS05E17,Yes,"The topic of abortion and pregnancy termination is explicitly mentioned in the conversation about a character being well into her second trimester and being told that 'time is running out if you decide you want to... terminate.'

PP,5,18,PPS05E18,No,
PP,5,19,PPS05E19,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is both mentioned and implied. There are explicit references to 'termination' when a character says 'this is way past the time for termination,' and there are discussions about a baby with no brain and the options available, including planning for the future and organ donation after birth. These conversations directly address pregnancy termination and the consideration of options in the case of a fatal fetal anomaly."
PP,5,20,PPS05E20,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is implied in several ways. There is a storyline about a woman (Reina) who attempts to self-induce labor by drinking a folk medicine in order to deliver her baby early so he can be a U.S. citizen before she is deported. The doctors discuss inducing labor at 35 weeks, weighing the risks and ethical implications, and explicitly mention that Reina might leave her baby behind for a better life. Additionally, there is a subplot involving a woman carrying an anencephalic baby to term for organ donation, and she discusses the emotional difficulty and her options, which implicitly references pregnancy termination as a possible alternative. Both storylines involve discussions of unwanted or complicated pregnancies and the consideration of ending or altering the course of the pregnancy, which are implicit references to abortion or pregnancy termination."
PP,5,21,PPS05E21,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is implied in the storyline about Amelia, who is pregnant with a baby that 'doesn't have a brain' (anencephaly). There are repeated references to her struggle with carrying the pregnancy, her addiction, and the discussion of whether to 'keep carrying this baby and give birth to him.' There is also mention of her baby being a potential organ donor, which is a common storyline in cases of fatal fetal anomalies where parents may choose to carry to term for donation purposes, often after considering or discussing termination. The emotional and medical context strongly implies that abortion or pregnancy termination is a relevant topic, even if not explicitly named."
PP,5,22,PPS05E22,No,
PP,6,1,PPS06E01,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is both explicitly and implicitly mentioned. Charlotte discovers she is pregnant despite having an IUD and says, 'The I.U.D. Has to be removed, and when it is, it's likely that I'll miscarry.' Later, she says, 'Pregnant. Not for long.' There is a discussion with Addison about options, and Charlotte says, 'I don't have that choice,' indicating she is not considering abortion but is expecting a miscarriage. The conversation about 'options' and the context of an unplanned, unwanted pregnancy, along with the explicit mention of pregnancy termination as a possibility, all indicate the topic is present."
PP,6,2,PPS06E02,No,

And I didn't-- I-I couldn't keep it. I just, uh, at the time, with him being the father, I just couldn't...' This clearly indicates that she became pregnant and chose not to continue the pregnancy, which is a direct reference to abortion or pregnancy termination."
PP,6,4,PPS06E04,Yes,"The topic of pregnancy termination is explicitly mentioned in the subtitles. There is a scene where a character named Megan is told she lost her baby and that the miscarriage was incomplete, so a D&C (dilation and curettage) will need to be performed. D&C is a procedure often used after a miscarriage or for pregnancy termination. Additionally, there are multiple references to repeated miscarriages, fertility struggles, and discussions about 'other options' for having a child, which can implicitly touch on the topic of pregnancy termination."
PP,6,5,PPS06E05,No,
PP,6,6,PPS06E06,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is both explicitly and implicitly mentioned several times in the subtitles. Explicitly, a character says, 'You should've told me to have an abortion. I should've had an abortion.' Additionally, there are discussions about pregnancy options, unwanted pregnancy, adoption as an alternative to parenting, and a wrongful birth lawsuit in which a mother claims she would have terminated the pregnancy if she had known the extent of her child's disability. These all directly or indirectly reference abortion or pregnancy termination."
PP,6,7,PPS06E07,Yes,"The episode contains multiple references to pregnancy, fertility treatments, miscarriages, and discussions of 'other options' for a woman who has had multiple failed pregnancies. Specifically, Dr. Reilly says to Megan, 'I did tell Megan that it might be time to consider other options,' which, in the context of repeated failed pregnancies, can imply considering not pursuing further pregnancies, possibly including pregnancy termination or adoption. Additionally, there are several discussions about loss of pregnancy and the emotional toll, which are often associated with conversations about abortion or pregnancy termination, even if not explicitly stated. Given the instruction to answer Yes if there is any doubt, the presence of these discussions warrants a Yes."
PP,6,8,PPS06E08,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is both explicitly and implicitly discussed. There are explicit references to 'selective reduction,' which is described as a procedure to reduce the number of fetuses in a multiple pregnancy (from triplets to twins), and the characters discuss whether or not to 'abort' one of the fetuses. The ethical and emotional implications of this decision are debated, and the word 'abortion' is used directly. There are also implicit references to the risks of pregnancy, spontaneous reduction, and the possibility of losing a fetus, but the explicit discussion of selective reduction and abortion makes the presence of the topic clear."

And it didn't feel fair when I found out I was pregnant. This baby... Our baby helped me stay clean.' This indicates a past pregnancy, and the context (her partner died, she is now single, no child is mentioned in her present life) could imply a pregnancy loss or termination. Additionally, there is a conversation about being 'pro-life' and abortion as a 'deal breaker' in a relationship, which is an explicit mention of the topic."

This is a clear reference to pregnancy termination, as treatment of an ectopic pregnancy involves ending the nonviable pregnancy to save the patient's life. The patient's relief at the diagnosis and the discussion of surgical intervention further reinforce the topic."
TGD,3,20,TGDS03E20,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is mentioned implicitly through the storyline involving a ruptured ectopic pregnancy and emergency surgery to remove the fallopian tube. Ectopic pregnancy treatment often involves terminating the non-viable pregnancy to save the patient's life. The subtitles explicitly mention 'ectopic pregnancy, the fallopian tube ruptured, patient would have died,' which is a clear reference to a pregnancy that cannot continue and must be terminated for medical reasons."
TGD,4,1,TGDS04E01,No,
TGD,4,2,TGDS04E02,No,
TGD,4,3,TGDS04E03,No,
TGD,4,4,TGDS04E04,Yes,"The topic of abortion is explicitly mentioned in the subtitles. One character says, 'My boyfriend decided his obligations ended at offering to pay for an abortion.' Additionally, another character is asked, 'Any pregnancy? Miscarriage, abortion, stillbirth?' and responds, 'I had an abortion when I was 15.' These are clear references to abortion and pregnancy termination."
TGD,4,5,TGDS04E05,No,
TGD,4,6,TGDS04E06,Yes,"The subtitles explicitly mention abortion and pregnancy termination multiple times. A 24-year-old woman presents with an unwanted pregnancy and requests an abortion. The episode discusses the medical and ethical aspects of abortion, including a suction D&C procedure, the patient's feelings, and the personal beliefs of the doctors involved. There are also references to the emotional impact and personal experiences with abortion, making the topic central to the episode."
TGD,4,7,TGDS04E07,No,
TGD,4,8,TGDS04E08,No,
TGD,4,9,TGDS04E09,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is explicitly discussed in the subtitles. A transgender man, Rio, is found to be pregnant, and the medical team discusses treatment options for his tumor that depend on whether he continues the pregnancy. Rio initially states, 'I'd like to terminate the pregnancy,' and later changes his mind, saying, 'I've changed my mind. I want to keep the baby.' The option to terminate the pregnancy is discussed multiple times in the context of medical treatment and personal choice."
TGD,4,10,TGDS04E10,No,
TGD,4,11,TGDS04E11,Yes,"At the end of the subtitles, a character reveals she is pregnant ('Shaun... I'm pregnant.'). While there is no explicit mention of abortion or pregnancy termination, the context of a dramatic reveal of an unexpected pregnancy, especially as a closing moment, often implies that the topic of options or decisions regarding the pregnancy may be addressed in the episode or in subsequent episodes. Given the instruction to answer Yes if there is any doubt and to include implicit references, the presence of an unexpected pregnancy is sufficient to answer Yes."
TGD,4,12,TGDS04E12,Yes,"The subtitles contain multiple discussions about an unplanned pregnancy, with the characters expressing doubts about whether it is the right time to have a child, weighing their options, and making lists of pros and cons. There are explicit references to making a decision about what to do, and a scene where a character is called by name in what appears to be a clinic or medical setting, expressing sadness about 'this was a good idea' but not feeling better, which strongly implies consideration of pregnancy termination. However, at the end, the characters decide to have the baby, but the topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is clearly present throughout the episode."
TGD,4,13,TGDS04E13,No,
TGD,4,14,TGDS04E14,No,
TGD,4,15,TGDS04E15,Yes,"The subtitles contain multiple references to pregnancy and expectant mothers, including a character discussing gestational diabetes testing, references to being 'expecting,' and concern for the health of a baby. While there is no explicit mention of abortion or pregnancy termination, the context includes a protest/rally (with signs and counter-protesters) and a shooting at the event, which is a common scenario in US television for episodes dealing with abortion rights rallies. The dialogue about 'waving signs,' 'democracy,' and 'making a difference' further supports the implication that the rally may be about abortion rights, especially given the presence of counter-protesters and the emotional context. If there is any doubt, the instruction is to answer Yes."
TGD,4,16,TGDS04E16,Yes,"The topic of pregnancy loss and termination is explicitly discussed. The episode features a storyline where a pregnant character, Lea, loses her baby due to medical complications. The doctors discuss her options: 'Medically, you have two choices. You can be sedated and have a D&C. Or some people decide to induce labor so they can hold their child.' D&C (dilation and curettage) is a procedure commonly used for pregnancy termination or management of miscarriage, and the discussion of inducing labor to deliver a non-viable fetus is also a form of pregnancy termination. The episode also covers the emotional and medical implications of these choices."

TGD,5,10,TGDS05E10,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is explicitly mentioned multiple times in the subtitles. For example, the doctors discuss the 'safest option is to terminate the pregnancy, resect the tumor, and begin chemotherapy' for a patient with cancer, and later recommend termination again due to a uterine vessel rupture. There are also discussions about the risks to the baby, miscarriage, and the patient's decision-making regarding whether to terminate the pregnancy or pursue other treatments. These references directly address pregnancy termination and related options."

TGD,6,5,TGDS06E05,No,
TGD,6,6,TGDS06E06,Yes,"There is an implicit reference to the topic of pregnancy and potential termination. In the conversation between two characters, one says, 'Being a surgeon, getting married, having kids? One of those is already off the table, and the others feel like they're sliding out of reach. I just... I feel like there's this huge hole in my life.' Later, another character says, 'That hole in my life? It's not that I want a boyfriend. I want a child.' While the dialogue does not explicitly mention abortion or pregnancy termination, the discussion of not being able to have children and the emotional impact could imply past issues with fertility, pregnancy loss, or possibly a terminated pregnancy. Given the instruction to answer 'Yes' if there is any doubt and to include implicit references, the answer is Yes."
TGD,6,7,TGDS06E07,Yes,"There is an explicit reference to 'refusing to selectively reduce' in the context of a high-order multiple pregnancy (sextuplets). 'Selective reduction' is a medical term for a procedure that reduces the number of fetuses, often for health or viability reasons, and is a form of pregnancy termination. Additionally, there are discussions about miscarriage, D&C (dilation and curettage, which can be used for pregnancy termination), and birth control, but the mention of selective reduction most clearly implies the topic of abortion or pregnancy termination."
TGD,6,8,TGDS06E08,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is implied in the storyline involving Naveen, who has a mass adherent to her uterus. The surgical team discusses the need for a 'gross total resection' that would require removing her uterus, which would end her ability to carry a child. The dialogue explicitly mentions that 'removing her uterus' will make it impossible for her to be pregnant, and the emotional weight of 'taking away her chance to carry a child' is discussed. While the word 'abortion' is not used, the loss of reproductive ability due to a medical procedure is a clear implicit reference to pregnancy termination."
TGD,6,9,TGDS06E09,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is implied in the final scene, where Lea tells Shaun she is pregnant and that her OB told them 'it isn't safe for me, or the baby.' This suggests a high-risk pregnancy where the possibility of termination may be considered or discussed, especially given the context of fear and uncertainty. The episode also references waiting to get pregnant due to Lea's Asherman's syndrome, further highlighting pregnancy complications and the potential for difficult decisions regarding pregnancy continuation."
TGD,6,10,TGDS06E10,No,
TGD,6,11,TGDS06E11,Yes,"The topic of pregnancy loss is mentioned when a character says, 'My implantation failed. It's been, what, nine days? Blood tests wouldn't be fully accurate. I could feel I was pregnant... and... then I wasn't.' While this refers to a failed implantation (likely in the context of IVF or fertility treatment), it is an implicit reference to pregnancy termination or loss. Additionally, there are multiple references to pregnancy, stress about motherhood, and past pregnancy complications, which could imply discussions or concerns related to pregnancy termination."
TGD,6,12,TGDS06E12,Yes,"The episode includes a storyline about a 13-year-old girl who develops an invasive hydatidiform mole, a tumor that develops from a mutated fertilized egg. The medical team discusses that the tumor must be removed, and the procedure performed is a curettage to evacuate the tumor from the uterus. This is a form of pregnancy termination, as a hydatidiform mole is a gestational trophoblastic disease arising from an abnormal pregnancy, and its removal is analogous to the process of terminating a non-viable pregnancy. Additionally, there are discussions about birth control, sexual activity, and the implications of a young teenager being sexually active, all of which are thematically adjacent to pregnancy and its potential termination."

TGD,6,14,TGDS06E14,No,
TGD,6,15,TGDS06E15,Yes,"The topic of abortion and pregnancy termination is explicitly discussed in the episode. There is a storyline involving a pregnant woman with complications (PPROM and infection) where the medical team discusses and recommends termination to save her life. The word 'terminate' is used multiple times, and the procedure is ultimately performed. Additionally, a character shares her own experience of having had an abortion.
