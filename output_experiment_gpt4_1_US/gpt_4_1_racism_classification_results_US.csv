CM,1,4,CMS01E04,Yes,"There are explicit references to racism and racial prejudice in the subtitles. For example, Mrs. Kovach says to Dr. Choi, 'The Orientals make the best doctors. It's their math skills,' which is a clear racial stereotype and microaggression. Later, it's revealed that Mrs. Kovach is part African-American, and there is discussion about 'the bigotry.' These moments directly address racial prejudice and stereotypes, making the topic present in the episode."
CM,1,5,CMS01E05,No,
CM,1,6,CMS01E06,Yes,"The episode includes both explicit and implicit references to racism, racial discrimination, and prejudice. Explicitly, the storyline involving Maria Gonzalez and her brother Miguel, who are undocumented immigrants from Mexico, addresses systemic inequalities and discrimination. Maria is deported (repatriated) by the hospital due to her undocumented status and lack of insurance, despite being in critical condition. This reflects systemic discrimination against immigrants, particularly those from Latin America. Additionally, the involvement of Homeland Security and the way the siblings are treated as stowaways further highlights issues of racial and ethnic prejudice. While there are no racial slurs or overtly racist remarks, the narrative clearly depicts the challenges and prejudices faced by undocumented immigrants, which are rooted in racial and ethnic discrimination."

CM,2,4,CMS02E04,Yes,"There is an implicit reference to racial prejudice when Mr. Hall, a patient, says to Dr. Choi, 'You're Chinese. I saw the Great Wall.' This comment reduces Dr. Choi to his ethnicity and makes an assumption based on his appearance, which is a form of racial microaggression and prejudice."

CM,2,9,CMS02E09,Yes,"There are explicit references to racism and racial prejudice in the subtitles. For example, the character Ricky Wade uses racial slurs such as 'towelhead' and makes derogatory comments about his opponent, Cyrus Hammad, referring to him as 'Arab' in a negative context. There are also implications of anti-Muslim sentiment ('the crowd, they cheered for blood. They wanted to see the Muslim boy get killed.') and a discussion about experiencing bias due to having a non-Western last name ('Not many families with the last name Choi where I grew up. Know the type all too well.'). These references indicate both explicit and implicit racism and racial prejudice."

CM,3,1,CMS03E01,Yes,"There are implicit references to systemic inequalities and the impact of violence in certain neighborhoods, which often correlate with racial and socioeconomic disparities. For example, the discussion about Mr. Jameson, who was shot and cannot safely return home because 'there's guys hanging around waiting to pop him again' in Garfield Park, and Maggie's comment, 'Treat 'em and street 'em is fine for people who live on your street. Not his,' suggest awareness of systemic issues that disproportionately affect marginalized communities, often along racial lines. Additionally, the conversation about lacking access to dental care due to financial hardship also hints at systemic inequalities that can be tied to race and ethnicity in many contexts."

CM,3,3,CMS03E03,No,
CM,3,4,CMS03E04,No,
CM,3,5,CMS03E05,Yes,"The topic of racism, racial discrimination, or racial prejudice is implied and mentioned in several ways. Most explicitly, Abena and her aunt, who are immigrants from Ghana, express concern that they are not receiving the best medical care because of their immigrant status and lack of insurance, which points to perceived or experienced systemic discrimination. Additionally, the dialogue discusses the HIV/AIDS stigma Abena likely faced 'growing up in Africa,' referencing HIV-related stigma and discrimination. There is also a scene where a character is asked to put on a mask before touching her niece, and the aunt questions if this is because her niece is 'contagious,' which can be read as an implicit reference to how people with certain illnesses (often racialized or associated with particular groups) are treated. These elements together indicate the presence of racial prejudice and discrimination, both systemic and interpersonal."
CM,3,6,CMS03E06,Yes,"The episode includes a storyline about a woman from North Carolina who, as a teenager, was sterilized without her knowledge or consent as part of a court order, reflecting the real-life history of forced sterilizations that disproportionately targeted poor women and women of color, especially in the American South. The subtitles explicitly mention that, up until 1973 in North Carolina, women could be sterilized without their knowledge or consent, and the character's mother describes the judge 'who practically ran the county' making the decision. This is a clear reference to systemic racism and eugenics policies that were racially and socioeconomically motivated. The discussion about poverty and lack of access to healthcare further implies systemic inequalities. Therefore, both explicit and implicit references to racial discrimination and systemic prejudice are present."

CM,3,10,CMS03E10,No,
CM,3,11,CMS03E11,No,
CM,3,12,CMS03E12,Yes,"There are implicit references to systemic inequalities and prejudice that often have racial or ethnic dimensions, even if not stated explicitly. For example, the storyline about the hospital allegedly prioritizing insured patients over indigent (uninsured) ones, and the ambulance driver saying 'Look around. The TV. The pizza? Everyone knows this room's just a ploy to get us to bring in paying customers.' This reflects systemic discrimination that, in the US context, disproportionately affects racial minorities. Additionally, the discussion around foster care and the challenges faced by homeless, underage, and pregnant girls alludes to broader systemic inequalities, which are often intertwined with racial and ethnic prejudice. While there are no explicit mentions of race or racial slurs, the presence of these systemic issues and their implications suggest that the topic is at least implied."

CM,4,4,CMS04E04,Yes,"The episode contains multiple explicit and implicit references to racism, racial prejudice, and discrimination. Explicitly, a white patient seeking opioids complains about a Latino patient, using derogatory language ('some hombre that probably can't even speak the language', 'Mexican or whatever'), and claims he is receiving preferential treatment despite being an immigrant. Implicitly, the storyline involving undocumented immigrants (Linda and Manny) highlights systemic discrimination: Linda is denied access to life-saving medical care due to her immigration status, and Manny refuses to donate stem cells out of fear of deportation. Ultimately, Manny is arrested by ICE at the hospital, and the narrative discusses the fear and barriers immigrants face in accessing healthcare, which are rooted in systemic racial and ethnic prejudice."

CM,4,15,CMS04E15,Yes,"There are explicit references to racism and racial prejudice in the subtitles. The driver of the truck expresses white supremacist views, saying, 'They're trying to deny our heritage... All this mixing, they wanna eliminate us. 'Us'? The white race. But before cancer takes me, I'm taking some of them. Was hoping for 20, but the day's not over yet.' Additionally, a patient makes a racist comment to a Black nurse ('One of those bossy blacks, aren't you?'), and there is a discussion about organ donation where a character refuses to donate her daughter's organs because she can't ensure they won't go to 'some racist like the man who did this.' There are also references to the deeper impact of racism on the characters' decisions and experiences."

CM,5,3,CMS05E03,No,
CM,5,4,CMS05E04,Yes,"There is an explicit reference to racism and racial prejudice in the scene where a conspiracy theory is spreading online, blaming the outbreak on 'MS-13 El Salvadoran plot to get revenge on America' and implicating 'Mama Garcia' because of her ethnicity and proximity to the outbreak. This is a clear example of racial scapegoating and prejudice being discussed or depicted in the episode."
CM,5,5,CMS05E05,No,
CM,5,6,CMS05E06,Yes,"There are implicit references to racial prejudice and systemic inequality. For example, Jacinta, a young woman, is attacked and refuses police help because she is 'illegal,' but it is later revealed she was born in Indiana and lied about her status to avoid police, suggesting fear of law enforcement due to racial profiling or immigration-related discrimination. The episode also depicts microaggressions and mistrust between patients and medical staff, which can be influenced by racial or ethnic biases, though not always stated explicitly. Additionally, the storyline involving gang initiation and foster care touches on systemic issues that disproportionately affect racial minorities. These elements imply the presence of racial prejudice and discrimination."

CM,5,14,CMS05E14,No,
CM,5,15,CMS05E15,Yes,"There are implicit references to racial prejudice and systemic inequalities. For example, Siana Fredericks, a pregnant woman experiencing a sickle cell crisis, refuses care from anyone but her trusted OB, stating, 'I've had too many doctors accuse me of using my pain as an excuse to get high.' This reflects a well-documented pattern of racial bias in healthcare, particularly toward Black patients with sickle cell disease, who are often undertreated for pain due to prejudiced assumptions about drug-seeking behavior. Additionally, the episode features a Black male prisoner who is subjected to a botched execution and then receives medical care only to be returned for another execution, touching on themes of systemic injustice and the dehumanization of incarcerated individuals, which can be tied to racial disparities in the criminal justice system. While there are no explicit mentions of race or racism, these storylines strongly imply the presence of racial prejudice and systemic discrimination."

CM,6,1,CMS06E01,Yes,"There are explicit and implicit references to racism and racial prejudice in the subtitles. For example, Mr. Lieu recounts an incident where a woman in a parking lot yelled at him and his daughter, 'You brought COVID here! It's your fault! Go back where you're from!'—a clear instance of anti-Asian racism and xenophobia. Additionally, April and Ethan discuss how many of their patients are dying at twice the rate due to discrimination, poverty, and terrible health care, referencing systemic racial inequalities and the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on marginalized communities."
CM,6,2,CMS06E02,Yes,"The episode contains several explicit and implicit references to racism, racial discrimination, and systemic inequalities. The storyline involving Aisha Barnes, a Black pregnant woman incarcerated for a minor parole violation (a broken taillight), highlights issues of racial bias and the disproportionate impact of the criminal justice system on people of color. Her complaints of illness are ignored in jail, and she is shackled during medical care, reflecting systemic mistreatment. The dialogue between Dr. Manning and Dr. Douglas about the difference in treatment between themselves and Aisha ('We both assault an officer. She gets separated from her baby, I get a slap on the wrist. I wonder what the difference is.') directly points to racial disparities. The episode also references the challenges of compassionate release and the lack of compassion in the justice system, which disproportionately affects people of color. These elements collectively indicate the presence of racism and racial prejudice, both explicitly and implicitly."
CM,6,3,CMS06E03,No,
CM,6,4,CMS06E04,No,
CM,6,5,CMS06E05,Yes,"There are both explicit and implicit references to race and racial bias in the episode. Explicitly, April discusses how clinical trial exclusion criteria disproportionately affect black patients, stating that only 3% of participants are black despite black people being 30% more likely to die from heart failure, and that 'biases like this' are to blame. There is also a discussion about how black men often have higher serum creatinine, which can unfairly exclude them from trials. Additionally, Maggie reflects on the unique burdens of being a black woman, referencing the 'necessary armor' and expectations placed on her due to her race and gender. These moments directly address systemic inequalities and the lived experience of racial bias."

CM,6,8,CMS06E08,No,
CM,6,9,CMS06E09,No,
CM,6,10,CMS06E10,Yes,"There is an implicit reference to racism or racial prejudice when Crockett Marcel reveals his birth name is Darioush Jahanbani and that his parents changed his and his sister's names to make it easier for them in school. This suggests they anticipated or experienced discrimination or prejudice based on their ethnic-sounding names, which is a form of racial or ethnic bias. Additionally, the episode includes a character named Arash Mehti, who is depicted as an immigrant whose father 'gave up everything to come to America,' and there is tension around cultural expectations and assimilation, which can also imply experiences of racial or ethnic prejudice, even if not explicitly discussed."
CM,6,11,CMS06E11,No,
CM,6,12,CMS06E12,No,
CM,6,13,CMS06E13,Yes,"There are implicit references to systemic racial and socioeconomic inequalities. For example, Jake's mother is described as low-income, struggling to keep food on the table, and working an overnight custodial shift, leaving her children alone. The hospital executive, Ms. Goodwin, offers financial assistance and a day-shift custodial job to help her, which highlights systemic barriers often faced by people of color and marginalized communities. While race is not explicitly mentioned, the combination of low-income status, single motherhood, and custodial work are often associated with racialized systemic inequalities in the U.S. Additionally, the episode features characters with names and roles (e.g., Ms. Goodwin, Maggie, Vanessa) that may suggest racial diversity, and the narrative explores issues of access, support, and bias that are frequently linked to racial and socioeconomic discrimination."
CM,6,14,CMS06E14,No,
CM,6,15,CMS06E15,No,
CM,6,16,CMS06E16,Yes,"There is an explicit reference to racism and racial prejudice near the end of the subtitles. Ms. Goodwin says to Dr. Choi, 'when I saw you get shot this morning, I immediately thought, ""hate crime."" And I've since learned that wasn't the case.' This directly references the possibility of a racially motivated attack, indicating that the topic of racism and racial prejudice is both mentioned and considered within the episode. Additionally, there are implicit references to systemic bias and concerns about fairness in hiring and advancement (e.g., Vanessa not wanting anyone to know Maggie is her mother to avoid assumptions about favoritism), but the explicit mention of a potential hate crime is sufficient."
CM,7,1,CMS07E01,Yes,"There are explicit references to racial health disparities and systemic inequalities. For example, the dialogue about sickle cell disease notes that less than 50% of kids get screened, while kids with cystic fibrosis (a disease more common among white patients) get more comprehensive care. A character explicitly states, 'most CF patients are white,' highlighting racial disparities in healthcare. Additionally, there are implicit references to stereotypes and social issues, such as gang involvement and homelessness, which often intersect with race in the context of urban settings. These elements suggest the presence of racial prejudice and systemic racism."
CM,7,2,CMS07E02,No,
CM,7,3,CMS07E03,No,
CM,7,4,CMS07E04,Yes,"There are explicit references to racial bias and systemic racism in psychiatry. Dr. Charles states that African Americans, particularly males, are misdiagnosed with schizophrenia far more than whites, and are perceived as dangerous, leading to higher medication doses and inappropriate treatment. This is a direct discussion of racial prejudice and systemic inequality in healthcare. Additionally, the episode touches on issues of policing and mental health, with implications about the risks faced by Black individuals when police are called to mental health crises."

CM,7,10,CMS07E10,No,
CM,7,11,CMS07E11,Yes,"There are implicit references to racial prejudice and potential systemic inequalities. For example, the scene with Dylan, Carmen, and Terrell involves a Black family, and Terrell expresses distrust toward Dylan, a former police officer, referencing a past arrest: 'Yeah, and you arrested me!... You watched them put them cuffs on me.' This exchange suggests a history of strained relationships between Black men and law enforcement, which is a common theme in discussions of racial bias and systemic racism. Additionally, the family's financial struggles and hesitation to seek medical care for their son ('money's tight') can be read as an implicit reference to socioeconomic and potentially racial disparities in healthcare access. While there are no explicit discussions of racism, the context and subtext imply its presence."
CM,7,12,CMS07E12,No,
CM,7,13,CMS07E13,No,
CM,7,14,CMS07E14,Yes,"There is an implicit reference to systemic inequalities related to race and education. In the subplot about Terrell, a Black male character, it is revealed that he likely has undiagnosed dyslexia, which went unnoticed due to lack of school funding and support. The dialogue ('our school? They didn't have the funding for that kind of thing') and the context (a Black man dropping out, feeling 'stupid,' and not receiving help) suggest systemic educational disparities that disproportionately affect communities of color. While racism is not explicitly mentioned, the depiction of structural barriers and their impact on a Black character's life implies racial inequality and the effects of systemic racism."

CM,7,19,CMS07E19,Yes,"The topic of racism is explicitly mentioned and discussed in the storyline involving Luis Pena and the protest against the relocation of a metal shredding facility from a white affluent neighborhood to a lower income (implied to be a community of color) neighborhood. The term 'environmental racism' is used directly, and the conversation centers on systemic inequalities and discrimination based on race and socioeconomic status."

CM,8,7,CMS08E07,No,
CM,8,8,CMS08E08,Yes,"There are several implicit references to systemic inequalities and racial/ethnic prejudice throughout the episode. The storyline involving Gloria, who is likely undocumented, highlights fear of the police and lack of trust in the system due to her immigration status—issues often tied to racial and ethnic discrimination. Dr. Cuevas reveals she is a DACA recipient, discussing the precariousness of her status and the need to keep it secret, which reflects experiences of discrimination and marginalization faced by immigrants, many of whom are people of color. Additionally, the storyline about Buddy, the homeless patient, addresses systemic neglect and disparities in healthcare access, which often disproportionately affect racial and ethnic minorities. The episode also touches on the skepticism about whether the system will protect marginalized individuals equally. These elements together suggest the presence of racial prejudice and systemic discrimination, even if not always explicitly labeled as such."
CM,8,9,CMS08E09,No,
CM,8,10,CMS08E10,No,
CM,8,11,CMS08E11,Yes,"The episode contains explicit and implicit references to racism and racial prejudice. Aaron, a young Black man, is immediately suspected of a robbery based on a vague description ('male, Black, average height, medium build, hoodie'), which is acknowledged by the characters as being applicable to many people and leading to bias ('they've already made up their minds'). Aaron himself expresses distrust in the system, stating that people like him 'gonna get blamed for it' regardless of the truth, referencing systemic racial bias and the presumption of guilt for Black individuals. The episode also discusses the impact of systemic issues, such as the foster care system and criminal justice, on people of color. These elements indicate both explicit and implicit depictions of racial prejudice and systemic inequality."
CM,8,12,CMS08E12,Yes,"There is an implicit reference to racial prejudice in the interaction between Daniel and Liliana. When Daniel introduces Liliana as a singer to another character who recognizes her as 'housekeeping,' Liliana later questions Daniel about whether he did this so the man wouldn't just think she was a housekeeper. This exchange implies an awareness of racial or ethnic stereotyping and the potential for prejudice based on her job and possibly her background. The scene suggests the presence of implicit bias and the discomfort it causes, which falls under the broader topic of racial prejudice."

CM,8,16,CMS08E16,Yes,"The subtitles include several references that suggest the presence of racism, racial discrimination, or prejudice, both explicitly and implicitly. The discussion of Dr. Cuevas' undocumented immigration status and DACA renewal highlights systemic issues affecting immigrants, many of whom are racial or ethnic minorities. The storyline involving Maria and her family, who are Spanish-speaking and face barriers in healthcare access, language, and insurance coverage, implies systemic inequalities and potential discrimination based on ethnicity and immigration status. The family's fear of hospitals and the insurance company's refusal to cover care at a better-equipped hospital further suggest disparities that disproportionately affect minority and immigrant communities. These elements collectively indicate the presence of racial or ethnic prejudice and systemic discrimination."

The storyline involving Luis Obrador and the group of Venezuelan migrants includes dialogue about their immigration status, with one character (Wade Martin) overhearing that Luis 'might be here illegally' and wanting to press charges, expressing concern about how it might affect his insurance. Wade later expresses resentment about resources being allocated to migrants, referencing his daughter's school gym being used as a shelter and feeling that 'nobody's looking out for us.' These moments reflect xenophobia and implicit racial/ethnic bias against migrants, which are forms of racial prejudice and discrimination. Additionally, the mention of a 'coyote' and the focus on migrants' health and legal status further imply systemic issues related to race and ethnicity."

For example, there is a scene involving a Chinese-speaking patient, Mrs. Lu, where the doctors struggle to communicate due to language barriers, and it is revealed she is undocumented and fears deportation ('no... jail', 'You're illegal'). This highlights issues of systemic inequality and discrimination faced by immigrants. Additionally, there is a brief exchange where Cristina, who is Korean, is asked to translate for a Chinese patient, and she points out the assumption based on her ethnicity.

The mention of a Black version of a doll and the specific reference to her Afro and collectibility touches on racial representation and stereotypes in toys. While the episode does not feature overt racism or racial prejudice, this exchange acknowledges racial difference and the history of racialized marketing in American culture, which can be considered an implicit reference to race and its social implications."

The medical team struggles to understand and respect the family's cultural and spiritual beliefs regarding illness and healing, and there are moments where the family's traditions are dismissed or misunderstood (e.g., 'Spare me the white-girl, cultural-divide love,' and the need to contact Social Services to explain Hmong beliefs). The dialogue highlights cultural bias and the challenges of navigating systemic healthcare practices that may not accommodate non-Western traditions, which can be considered a form of racial or ethnic prejudice."

While the nickname is not a racial slur, its use in reference to a Black character can carry problematic and racially insensitive connotations, especially considering the historical context. Additionally, there are subtle references to cultural backgrounds, such as Dr. Burke mentioning his mother owns a restaurant in Alabama (he is also a Black character), and a comment about Meredith being a 'WASP' (White Anglo-Saxon Protestant), which is a reference to ethnicity and class. While there is no explicit discussion of racism or racial prejudice, these elements suggest that race and racial identity are present and, in the case of the nickname, potentially problematic."

The Chief's niece, Camille, is a Black character, and her storyline involves family dynamics and medical care, though no explicit racial discrimination is shown. The use of 'Nazi' as a nickname for a strict doctor is also problematic, though not directly racial.

This categorization of colleagues by race and gender is an explicit mention of race and could be interpreted as racial bias or prejudice.

While there is no direct mention of racism or discrimination in this excerpt, the explicit mention of being 'young, gifted and black' in a context about recognition and achievement in a competitive environment suggests an awareness of race as a meaningful aspect, potentially alluding to racial prejudice or the need to stand out as a minority."

There is also a discussion about a child not eating American food and a doctor making nsima, a staple in East African countries, to help her feel more comfortable, which touches on cultural differences and potential microaggressions. Additionally, there are references to the adoption process for an African child and the scrutiny involved, which can imply systemic inequalities.

This language exoticizes and reduces African children to their illnesses, which is a form of racial stereotyping and prejudice.

It is revealed that the foundation that funds the award co-owns the hospital where she works, making her ineligible to win due to a conflict of interest. The language used ('window dressing,' 'used her,' 'she was never going to win that damn thing for a second') and the context of her being a highly qualified candidate who is denied recognition due to institutional politics strongly suggest themes of systemic bias and discrimination, which are often intertwined with race and ethnicity in professional settings.

Aliyah's father, Dakhir Hamed, is identified as a member of a minority community and is told by Jess's parents to 'keep your damn daughter away from our little girl,' which is an explicit act of prejudice. The use of names and the context suggests Aliyah is likely from a Muslim or Middle Eastern background, and her family is depicted as outsiders who 'came to this country.' There is also a scene where Jess's mother refers to Aliyah as a 'terrible influence,' and the parents plan to send Jess to a conversion camp, which is an example of systemic discrimination against LGBTQ+ youth. Additionally, there are discussions about bullying based on appearance, disability, and other differences, as well as a reference to a rumor about a doctor stabbing a 'white supremacist,' which further suggests the presence of racial or ideological prejudice.

Additionally, later in the episode, Dr. Shepherd is quick to believe Edwards lied about her illness based on the word of another doctor, and Dr. Webber questions why it was so easy to doubt Edwards' integrity, which can be read as an implicit reference to racial bias in professional settings."

Dillard University is a historically Black university, and the dismissive tone suggests a stereotype or bias against the quality of education at HBCUs, which is often rooted in racial prejudice. Additionally, the follow-up conversation ('She said, ""She's from Dillard,"" like it's a welding school.') and the character's response ('I might be from Dillard, but I am here now!... and I am a dark freaking horse!') further highlight that this is about more than just academic rivalry, but about implicit bias regarding race and educational background."

GA,13,10,GAS13E10,Yes,"While the subtitles do not explicitly mention racism or racial prejudice, there are several implicit references to systemic inequalities that disproportionately affect people of color. The episode depicts the harsh treatment of incarcerated pregnant women, the lack of adequate medical care and resources in the prison system, and the use of restraints on a woman in labor. These are all issues that, in reality, are deeply intertwined with racial disparities and systemic racism in the criminal justice and healthcare systems. The dialogue about state resource allocation, the dehumanizing treatment of inmates, and the lack of empathy from authorities all suggest the presence of systemic prejudice, which often has a racial component, even if not directly named in this episode. If there is any doubt, the answer is Yes."

GA,14,1,GAS14E01,Yes,"There are implicit references to racial discrimination and systemic inequalities. For example, in the case of Beau Martinez, his parent says, 'They treat him like he's a drug addict or something. That's not my kid.' This suggests that Beau, likely a person of color based on his surname, is being stereotyped and denied adequate pain management, which is a documented form of racial bias in healthcare. Additionally, Megan discusses her adopted son Farouk, a Syrian refugee, and the difficulties in bringing him to the U.S. due to immigration laws, touching on systemic barriers faced by people from certain racial or ethnic backgrounds. These examples indicate that issues of racial prejudice and systemic discrimination are present, even if not discussed explicitly."
GA,14,2,GAS14E02,No,
GA,14,3,GAS14E03,Yes,"There is an explicit reference to race and racial dynamics when Miranda Bailey, a Black woman and the hospital chief, is told by Dr. Webber, 'But you embarrassed that old white man. Now, you need to let me go back in there and fix it my way in my own time.' This line directly references the racial identity of Harper Avery and the implications of a Black woman challenging a powerful white man in a position of authority. The episode also features subtle power dynamics and microaggressions, such as Harper Avery's dismissive language toward women in leadership ('That's the problem when women are in charge. It's always personal.'), which, while primarily sexist, can intersect with racial prejudice given the context. These elements suggest that issues of race and racial prejudice are present in the episode."
GA,14,4,GAS14E04,No,
GA,14,5,GAS14E05,Yes,"There are several implicit references to race and ethnicity throughout the episode. For example, there is a scene where a female patient named Sana refuses to be touched by men, which may suggest cultural or religious differences often associated with Middle Eastern backgrounds. There are also references to 'Iraqi allies' and 'Iraqi woman' as a shooter, and the way some characters talk about the Iraqi suspects and victims could be interpreted as reflecting racial or ethnic bias, especially when one character assumes the male Iraqi was the shooter when it was actually a woman. Additionally, the episode is set in a military context in Iraq, and the depiction of local Iraqis as shooters or victims, as well as the American soldiers' attitudes toward them, may imply racial or ethnic stereotyping or prejudice. While there are no explicit discussions of racism, the context and some character interactions suggest implicit racial and cultural biases."

GA,14,7,GAS14E07,No,
GA,14,8,GAS14E08,No,
GA,14,9,GAS14E09,Yes,"The episode explicitly addresses issues related to racism, racial discrimination, and prejudice through the storyline of Dr. Bello, who is a 'Dreamer' under DACA and faces deportation by ICE. The episode discusses the fear and consequences of being undocumented, the threat of deportation for minor infractions, and the impact of immigration enforcement on individuals who have lived in the U.S. since childhood. It also touches on systemic inequalities and the emotional toll of immigration policies on people of color and immigrants. These themes are central to the episode and clearly imply racial and ethnic prejudice and discrimination."
GA,14,10,GAS14E10,Yes,"The episode explicitly addresses racism, racial prejudice, and systemic bias. A Black 12-year-old boy is shot by police while entering his own home, and characters discuss racial profiling, bias in policing, and the need to give Black children 'the talk' about how to survive encounters with law enforcement. There are direct references to the different treatment of 'white kids versus brown kids,' and a character describes his own experience being stopped and handcuffed by police for 'fitting the description.' The episode explores both explicit and implicit forms of racial discrimination and prejudice."
GA,14,11,GAS14E11,Yes,"There are implicit references to race and the challenges faced by people of color, particularly women of color, in the medical field. For example, Miranda Bailey states, '63% of women who die suddenly from coronary heart disease had no previous symptoms, and women of color are at a far greater risk. So if I were consulting on the patient you describe, I would take into consideration statistics that would never even occur to people who look like you.' This highlights systemic inequalities and the unique risks and biases faced by women of color in healthcare. Additionally, Miranda describes herself as 'a sci-fi-loving African-American woman in her 40s,' and the episode explores how she must fight harder to be taken seriously, which can be read as an implicit reference to racial and gender bias in medicine."
GA,14,12,GAS14E12,Yes,"There are several implicit references to systemic racial inequalities and disparities in this episode. For example, the discussion about the United States having a maternal mortality rate six times higher than Italy's, and the focus on why 'our maternity mortality rate' is so high, is a reference to a real-world issue that disproportionately affects Black women and women of color in the U.S. The episode also features diverse characters (e.g., Kimmie Park, a young Asian girl) and touches on issues of bias and representation in medicine (e.g., the gender-affirming surgery storyline and mention of cisgender privilege). While there are no explicit mentions of racism or racial slurs, the systemic inequalities and disparities in healthcare outcomes, especially around maternal mortality, are well-known to be linked to racial bias and discrimination. Therefore, the topic is implied."

GA,14,20,GAS14E20,Yes,"The episode contains an extensive storyline about Dr. Harper Avery, a prominent figure, having sexually harassed multiple women and then using his power and money to silence them and bar them from working at his hospitals or winning his foundation's awards. While the primary focus is on sexual harassment and abuse of power, there are also references to systemic discrimination, as the women were not only harassed but also had their careers crippled due to their gender and the actions of a powerful white male in medicine. The dialogue about how these women were treated, silenced, and excluded from opportunities at Harper Avery hospitals and awards implies systemic bias and discrimination. Additionally, there are references to a foster care experience, but no explicit or implicit racial prejudice is described in that context. However, due to the clear presence of systemic discrimination and the intersectionality of gender and power (and possible race, given the context of medicine), the answer is Yes."
GA,14,21,GAS14E21,Yes,"There is an explicit reference to race and systemic inequality when Jackson says, 'There's no way a powerful black woman is gonna take the fall for a rich old white guy that couldn't keep his damn hands to himself.' This directly addresses racial dynamics and the injustice of a Black woman being scapegoated for the actions of a white man. Additionally, the episode discusses issues of systemic discrimination, power imbalances, and the impact of institutional abuse, which are often intertwined with issues of race and gender in professional settings."

She's smart, you're funny, you're, you're hitting it off. And then she says the One Thing, right, the one, uh, slightly racist thing.'

GA,15,23,GAS15E23,Yes,"The subtitles include an explicit discussion of a family detained and separated at the U.S. border, with references to being 'caged like animals.' The storyline addresses the difficulties faced by immigrants seeking asylum, systemic barriers to healthcare (such as being denied insurance due to income despite low-wage work), and the threat of deportation. There is also mention of how seeking asylum can result in children being jailed with their parents, contrasting with the treatment of citizens. These elements directly and implicitly address issues of racial discrimination, systemic inequality, and prejudice based on ethnicity and immigration status."
GA,15,24,GAS15E24,No,
GA,15,25,GAS15E25,Yes,"There is an implicit reference to racial privilege and systemic inequality in the conversation between Maggie and Jackson. Maggie points out that Jackson missed out on 'the opportunity to learn consequences due to your privilege,' and contrasts her own experiences with financial aid, student loans, and worrying about affording college with Jackson's privileged background. This discussion of privilege, financial hardship, and the differences in their life experiences is an implicit reference to issues of race and systemic inequality, especially given that Maggie and Jackson are both Black characters and Jackson is also wealthy. While the episode does not explicitly mention racism or racial discrimination, the conversation implies awareness of racial and socioeconomic disparities."

Additionally, the episode discusses issues like disparities in healthcare access ('the rich live 10 to 15 years longer than the poor'), which often have racial dimensions in the U.S. While there are no explicit racial slurs or direct discussions of race, the mention of institutionalized discrimination and systemic issues in healthcare implies the presence of racial prejudice or racism."

GA,17,1,GAS17E01,Yes,"There are both explicit and implicit references to racism and racial disparities in the subtitles. Explicitly, a character says, 'I tried explaining to my grandma how this is impacting Black folks more severely,' which references the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on Black communities—a systemic racial inequality. Additionally, a patient says, 'I don't want a Chinese doctor,' which is an explicit example of racial prejudice and discrimination. These examples confirm that issues of racism, racial discrimination, or racial prejudice are present in the episode."
GA,17,2,GAS17E02,Yes,"There is an explicit reference to racial disparities in healthcare when Catherine and Maggie discuss that 'too many of them are black and brown, and not enough people seem to care.' This statement directly addresses systemic racial inequalities and the disproportionate impact on patients of color. Additionally, the conversation acknowledges frustration with the lack of access to healthcare, which is often tied to systemic racism. These references indicate that the topic of racism and racial discrimination is present in the episode."
GA,17,3,GAS17E03,Yes,"There is an explicit mention of racial disparities in COVID-19 outcomes: one character says, '53 people. That's how many have died on my watch since this thing started. 53. And most of them have been Black women, so that means... The same thing's happening here. Everywhere.' This directly references systemic racial inequalities in healthcare and the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on Black women, which is a clear reference to racial discrimination and systemic racism."
GA,17,4,GAS17E04,Yes,"There are both explicit and implicit references to racism and racial bias in these subtitles. Explicitly, there is a scene where a character, Dr. Kim, is asked 'Where are you from?' by a patient, and another character points out that the question is about his ethnicity, not his medical specialty, highlighting a common microaggression faced by Asian-Americans. Later, there is a discussion about a misdiagnosis involving an Asian-American patient, where it's pointed out that the standard of care is centered around white patients, and that right-sided diverticulitis is much more common in patients of Asian descent. The conversation addresses the need for equity rather than equality in medicine and acknowledges the presence of biases, including those related to race. There are also references to the Japanese-American internment camps, with characters sharing family histories of being interned during WWII, which is an explicit reference to historical racial discrimination. These elements clearly indicate that the episode addresses racism, racial prejudice, and systemic inequalities."
GA,17,5,GAS17E05,Yes,"The episode contains explicit discussions of racism and systemic racial inequality, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Characters discuss how half of their COVID patients are Black and brown in a city that is only 7% Black, and they talk about how pre-existing conditions are often blamed on individuals rather than acknowledging that these conditions are 'manmade' due to systemic racism. They mention being pushed into frontline jobs, living in overcrowded situations, and being surrounded by environmental hazards, all of which are linked to systemic racism. The phrase 'existing while Black' and the statement 'systemic racism is the root of the whole damn thing' are direct references to racial prejudice and discrimination. Additionally, there are references to microaggressions and prejudice in education, such as guidance counselors suggesting Black students attend less prestigious schools and the reaction of 'very proper' (white) ladies to a Black scholarship recipient. These elements make the presence of racism and racial prejudice both explicit and implicit throughout the episode."
GA,17,6,GAS17E06,Yes,"The episode contains an explicit discussion of systemic racism and racial disparities. Maggie delivers a monologue about how Black girls are more vulnerable to being taken, are seen as less innocent, and are hypersexualized in the media. She also points out that COVID is killing Black people at a much higher rate and that if it were affecting white people at the same rate, there would be a stronger response. These are direct references to racial prejudice, systemic inequality, and the experience of racism. Additionally, there are implicit references to the criminal justice system's treatment of Black women (Jada's mother being arrested during a traumatic event), and the episode highlights the emotional toll of these injustices."
GA,17,7,GAS17E07,No,
GA,17,8,GAS17E08,Yes,"There is an implicit reference to racism in the conversation about escaping to the woods, where a character says, 'Trees are not racist. Trees do not politicize a disease...' This line suggests an awareness of racism and racialized responses to the pandemic in the outside world, even if not directly discussed in detail. Additionally, the episode features characters of diverse backgrounds, but the explicit mention of racism is in that line, indicating the topic is at least acknowledged."
GA,17,9,GAS17E09,No,
GA,17,10,GAS17E10,No,
GA,17,11,GAS17E11,Yes,"There are implicit references to systemic inequalities and racial disparities, particularly in the discussion about hotel rooms for COVID quarantine. Dr. Ortiz mentions that 'the whole system... is not designed to help the people that actually need it. Especially when they look like us.' This suggests an awareness of racial or ethnic disparities in access to healthcare and support, implying racial prejudice or systemic racism. Additionally, the conversation about low-income neighborhoods and access to resources further implies systemic inequalities that often have racial dimensions."
GA,17,12,GAS17E12,Yes,"The episode contains multiple explicit and implicit references to racism, racial discrimination, and racial prejudice. There are scenes involving protests with chants like 'No justice! No peace!' and 'Equality right now!', which are directly associated with anti-racism movements. Characters discuss the dangers of protesting, particularly for Black individuals, and there is a tense scene where a Black character is pulled over by police and subjected to an extended search, highlighting racial profiling and the fear associated with police encounters. There are also discussions about systemic racism in medicine, such as the Black maternal mortality rate and racial bias in medical training. The episode references historical civil rights protests, including the March on Washington and the fight against apartheid, and characters reflect on the scars—literal and metaphorical—of fighting for racial equality. All these elements indicate that the topic of racism and racial prejudice is both mentioned and implied throughout the episode."
GA,17,13,GAS17E13,Yes,"There are several implicit and explicit references to race and the experiences of Black women. For example, a character says, 'It's something that we're taught as women, as Black women. And I'm guilty of it.' This line explicitly references the unique pressures faced by Black women, which can be tied to systemic inequalities and societal expectations rooted in racial and gender bias. Additionally, there are mentions of protests and teachers being 'scared to say anything' when discussing them, which, given the context of 2021 and the mention of protests, likely alludes to racial justice protests (e.g., Black Lives Matter). These elements suggest that issues of race, racism, and racial prejudice are present in the episode."
GA,17,14,GAS17E14,Yes,"There are explicit references to racism, racial discrimination, and systemic racial inequities in medicine. For example, Jackson says, 'You know how many people of color we've already lost since the pandemic started? The system keeps diminishing and erasing us. T-They're literally letting people just die in the streets, and we can do something about it.' He also states, 'White supremacy is woven into the fabric of this country, and that means medicine, too. People that look like us should not have to be gaslit, shamed, and ignored when they're just going to the doctor, constantly having to prove that their lives have any value.' These statements directly address racial prejudice, systemic racism, and the impact of white supremacy on healthcare. The episode also discusses the need for 'real racial equity in medicine' and the desire to 'reallocate every penny that we have to equity in medicine... Women's health, trans health, racial equity.'"
GA,17,15,GAS17E15,Yes,"There are both explicit and implicit references to racism, racial discrimination, and racial prejudice in these subtitles. Explicitly, there is a discussion about Indigenous communities facing disproportionate impacts from COVID, lack of PPE, and less access to healthcare and running water, which points to systemic inequalities. The mention of body bags being sent instead of PPE to tribal clinics is a reference to neglect and systemic racism. There is also a direct line, 'Well, good luck finding any racism,' which, though sarcastic, references the existence of racism. Additionally, a character reflects on being the only white man to survive a COVID ward and acknowledges injustice caused by 'people who look like me,' expressing a desire to be an ally and address systemic racism. The episode also highlights microaggressions and the challenges faced by Indigenous patients in big hospitals, further implying racial bias and discrimination."
GA,17,16,GAS17E16,Yes,"There are explicit references to racism and racial inequity. For example, a character mentions that another left to 'fight racial inequity and make the world a better place.' Later, a character says, 'Anyway, I have spent the last few weeks worrying about how to get back to normal, but look where normal got us. Sexism, racism, inequality, substandard care. What has just happened, we should never want to go back to that.' These lines directly mention racism and racial inequality as issues being addressed or discussed in the episode."
GA,17,17,GAS17E17,Yes,"There are implicit references to race and racial experience. For example, in the wedding scene, Maggie's family expresses a desire for a larger, more traditional wedding with extended family, which can be read as referencing cultural expectations and family traditions that may have racial or ethnic significance. More explicitly, in a group therapy scene, a character says, 'my boyfriend, my, um, child's father... he is not one of us. And I am so glad that he does not have to go through life like that. Um, but... sometimes, there's a part of me that wishes he got it. You know, just, uh... really got it. I feel lonely in it.' This strongly implies the speaker is talking about the experience of being a racial minority and the isolation that can come from having a partner who does not share that experience. Additionally, there are references to a character sending money to family in Manila, which, while not directly about racism, highlights the presence of immigrant and ethnic minority characters and their experiences. No explicit racism or slurs are present, but the episode does touch on racial identity and the lived experience of being a minority."
GA,18,1,GAS18E01,No,
GA,18,2,GAS18E02,Yes,"The episode explicitly discusses systemic racial bias in medicine, specifically the use of race-based adjustments in the eGFR formula that disadvantages Black patients seeking kidney transplants. Characters discuss how these medical assumptions and formulas are rooted in racist ideas about Black people's bodies, leading to real-world discrimination and health disparities. The storyline follows a Black patient, Rashida, who is denied a transplant due to this biased formula, and the doctors' efforts to challenge and correct this injustice. This is a clear depiction of racism and racial prejudice, both in individual experiences and systemic structures."

GA,18,5,GAS18E05,No,
GA,18,6,GAS18E06,Yes,"There is an explicit reference to the colonization and land theft experienced by Native Americans, as discussed by Zola and Meredith ('Thanksgiving isn't really a holiday we should celebrate. There's no actual evidence Native Americans were even invited to a feast. I think they cared more about being colonized and having their land stolen than mashed potatoes.'). This directly addresses historical racism and prejudice against Native Americans. Additionally, there are implicit references to societal inequalities, such as the discussion about women not being given permission to talk about what they want or need, and the struggles of a family dealing with medical bills and lack of support, which can be tied to systemic issues, though not explicitly racial in those cases. The Native American reference is sufficient for a 'Yes' answer."

Dr. Webber recounts a story about a patient who felt comforted seeing a surgeon who shared his racial background, highlighting the significance of racial identity and representation in medicine. This suggests an awareness of racial dynamics and the importance of diversity, which is often rooted in a history of underrepresentation and discrimination."

A character named Alice Tom is assaulted at a bus stop, and it is stated that the attacker was 'using racial slurs and yelling at her to go back to where she's from.' The attack is described as a hate crime. Later, there is a conversation about the experience of being seen as foreign in America, referencing historical events such as the Japanese American internment and the Watsonville Riots, as well as being wrongly blamed for COVID. These are clear and direct discussions and depictions of racism and racial prejudice."
GA,18,19,GAS18E19,Yes,"There is an explicit reference to prejudice and discrimination based on sexual orientation in the blood donation scene. A character is excluded from donating blood due to being a sexually active gay man, and this is discussed as 'prejudice' and 'disgusting.' While this is not racial prejudice, it is a form of discrimination based on identity. Additionally, there are references to a character being 'the Spanish woman,' but this is not developed into a clear instance of racial bias. Since the instructions say to include all forms of prejudice based on race or ethnicity and to answer 'Yes' if there is any doubt, and since the episode contains explicit discussion of systemic discrimination (albeit not racial), the answer is Yes."
GA,18,20,GAS18E20,No,
GA,19,1,GAS19E01,Yes,"There is an explicit reference to racism and racial disparities when Dr. Jules Millin recognizes Dr. Pierce for her article about 'racial disparities in outcomes after bypass surgery.'

For example, the episode discusses how zip codes are a key determinant of longevity, which often reflects racial and socioeconomic segregation and its impact on health outcomes. Additionally, the storyline involving the incarcerated patient, Mr. Jiménez, highlights neglect and lack of adequate healthcare in the prison system, which disproportionately affects people of color due to systemic racism. The mention that his punishment 'was supposed to be time, not death,' and that he was ignored when he got sick, further implies systemic inequities. While there are no explicit discussions of race or racial slurs, these elements suggest the presence of racial prejudice and systemic discrimination."
GA,20,7,GAS20E07,Yes,"There are implicit references to racial disparities in maternal health outcomes, particularly with the storyline of Lauren's preeclampsia and her husband's fear that 'Lauren was not gonna be another statistic.' The phrase 'another statistic' in the context of a Black family (as suggested by the names and casting in the likely show this is from) alludes to the well-documented higher rates of maternal mortality and complications among Black women in the US, often due to systemic racism and bias in healthcare. Additionally, Simone's reflection that her mother died in childbirth at the same hospital, and her concern that 'someone missed something,' further implies the ongoing issue of Black women not being listened to or adequately cared for in medical settings. These are implicit but clear references to racial prejudice and systemic inequality."
GA,20,8,GAS20E08,Yes,"There are implicit references to racial prejudice and microaggressions. For example, one character mentions 'awkward stares and the microaggressions' and describes families feeling so unsafe in Texas that they consider putting a bulletproof vest on their trans son to see a doctor, indicating a hostile environment for marginalized groups. While this is primarily about transphobia, the mention of microaggressions and hostile environments in the context of marginalized identities can also be linked to racial prejudice, as the term 'microaggressions' is frequently associated with both racial and other forms of bias. Additionally, the episode includes diverse character names and some subtle references to bias in professional settings, though not overtly racial. Given the instruction to answer 'Yes' if there is any doubt, the presence of microaggressions and discussion of prejudice against marginalized groups is sufficient."

GA,21,5,GAS21E05,Yes,"The episode contains several implicit and explicit references to racial discrimination and systemic inequalities. The storyline involving Zayne Johnson, a Black hospital worker with sickle cell disease, highlights issues of healthcare inequity: he cannot access a new gene therapy cure because his insurance won't cover it and the treatment is prohibitively expensive. The dialogue references the systemic barriers faced by people with sickle cell (a disease that disproportionately affects Black people), including stigmas, misunderstandings, and being seen as 'a code or a cost' by the system. Characters discuss how the system 'doesn't care if you suffer or even if you live or die,' and that seeking treatment with sickle cell is 'a minefield of stigmas and misunderstandings.' These are clear references to systemic racial inequities and prejudice in healthcare."

GA,21,10,GAS21E10,Yes,"There are implicit references to racial prejudice and systemic inequality in the storyline involving Evynn and Tasha. They mention being rejected by two hospitals, with the implication that their case was not given fair consideration and that Evynn's medical credentials were questioned, making her feel 'lesser' and 'small.' This suggests bias or discrimination, possibly intersecting with race, especially as the show often addresses such themes. Additionally, the characters Dr. Ndugu and Dr. Bailey, both Black, are present in leadership roles, and the show is known for addressing racial issues, though no explicit slurs or overt racism are present in these subtitles. The narrative of having to 'take care of ourselves because no one else cares as much' also hints at systemic mistrust, often rooted in experiences of racial bias in healthcare."

H,1,1,HS01E01,Yes,"There are both explicit and implicit references to race and racial prejudice in the subtitles. Explicitly, there is a conversation where Dr. Foreman, a Black doctor, discusses his juvenile record and the implications of being hired because of it. He references 'centuries of slavery, decades of civil rights marches,' and questions whether it's 'kind of disgusting' that he gets a top job because of his delinquency, which is a clear allusion to racial history and prejudice. Later, House says, 'You hired a black guy because he had a juvenile record. No. It wasn't a racial thing. I didn't see a black guy. I just saw a doctor with a juvenile record.' This exchange directly addresses issues of race, hiring biases, and the perception of racial discrimination. There are also implicit references to systemic inequalities, such as the discussion about low-wage workers needing to work while sick, which can be tied to broader social and racial disparities."

This exchange acknowledges the character's Black identity and references the possibility of racial factors affecting the situation, even if only to dismiss it. This constitutes an implicit mention of race and potential racial prejudice or discrimination, satisfying the criteria for a 'Yes' answer."
H,1,8,HS01E08,Yes,"There are two notable implicit references to race and racial prejudice. First, a character says 'This is gonna be a racial thing, isn't it?' when discussing why another character is assumed to be a drug user, suggesting awareness of racial stereotyping or bias. Second, when identifying the poisoned students on the bus, one is referred to as 'the Asian kid,' which is a reduction of identity to race and could be seen as a microaggression or stereotype. These moments indicate the presence of racial topics, even if not the main focus of the episode."

H,1,15,HS01E15,Yes,"There are implicit references to prejudice and discrimination related to sexuality, which are often intertwined with issues of masculinity and, in some contexts, racial or ethnic stereotypes (e.g., the mobster's fear of being perceived as gay, the overreaction to rumors about being a 'homo,' and the concern about reputation in prison and in the mob). Additionally, there are mentions of 'sensitivity training' and staff making inappropriate comments about the patient being a 'crackhead or a homo,' which suggests a workplace culture that may also be insensitive to other forms of prejudice, including racial prejudice. While there are no explicit mentions of racism or racial discrimination, the presence of microaggressions, stereotypes, and discussions about prejudice (even if centered on sexuality) indicate that the episode touches on themes of bias and discrimination. If there is any doubt, the answer should be 'Yes.'"
H,1,16,HS01E16,No,
H,1,17,HS01E17,Yes,"The topic of racism and racial prejudice is explicitly mentioned and discussed multiple times in the subtitles. The senator refers to being told he doesn't have a chance because he's black and doesn't 'have the right nose.' There are references to the challenges of being a black politician, such as not being given the benefit of the doubt, not being cut a second chance, and the pressure of being a role model for the race. There's also a pointed remark about the White House not being called that 'because of the paint job,' which is an implicit reference to racial exclusion. These elements clearly indicate the presence of discussions about racism and racial prejudice."
H,1,18,HS01E18,No,
H,1,19,HS01E19,Yes,"There is an implicit reference to racial stereotyping and prejudice in the scene where House interviews a candidate with a tattoo of an Asian letter. House sarcastically mocks the candidate's 'nonconformity' and makes a stereotypical comment about 'Asian kids who don't leave the library for 20-hour stretches,' implying a racial stereotype about Asian students and academic pressure. Additionally, the conversation about reviewing résumés for 'Asian names' further suggests racial bias in hiring practices. These instances indicate the presence of racial prejudice and stereotyping, even if presented in a satirical or critical manner."

H,1,21,HS01E21,No,
H,1,22,HS01E22,Yes,"There are implicit references to racism and racial prejudice in the subtitles. For example, House refers to Dr. Foreman as 'Dr. Mandingo' and tells him to go ask the wife if she's been 'messin' around,' and later says, 'Dr. Mandingo, you're needed at the plantation house.' These are racially charged references: 'Mandingo' is a term historically associated with racist stereotypes of Black men, and 'plantation house' evokes imagery of slavery in the American South. These comments are played as jokes but are rooted in racial stereotypes and microaggressions. Additionally, there is a line where Foreman jokes about being tired from 'stealing cars,' referencing a stereotype about Black people and crime. These examples indicate the presence of racial prejudice and microaggressions, even if not the main theme of the episode."
H,2,1,HS02E01,Yes,"There are explicit references to racism and racial prejudice in the subtitles. For example, there is a discussion about the racial disparity in death penalty sentencing ('Black defendants are 10 times more likely to get a death sentence than whites'), and jokes about being kept down by 'The Man.' There are also implicit references, such as characters discussing their backgrounds, being judged for being 'black' or from the 'inner city,' and exchanges about stereotypes and assumptions based on race (e.g., 'How a brother like you go from gang banging to wearing that white coat?'). These elements indicate the presence of both explicit and implicit references to racism and racial prejudice."
H,2,2,HS02E02,No,
H,2,3,HS02E03,Yes,"There are multiple explicit and implicit references to racism, racial prejudice, and discrimination in these subtitles.

There is also the use of the term 'Oreo' as a racial slur, and a character's suspicion about being prescribed a 'racist drug.' These references show both explicit and implicit engagement with issues of racism and racial prejudice."
H,2,4,HS02E04,No,
H,2,5,HS02E05,Yes,"There are both explicit and implicit references to race and racial bias in the subtitles. Explicitly, the patient's race is mentioned as a diagnostic factor: 'He's black. I'm assuming he's not just really dirty, but is of African descent, which means he'd have a lower white count.' This line both references the patient's race and uses a potentially insensitive joke. Additionally, the patient's grandfather is noted to have served 'in an all-black tank battalion under Patton,' referencing historical racial segregation in the military. There are also implicit references to socioeconomic status and assumptions about the patient's background, such as the father's concern about his son accepting things from 'rich friends' and wanting him to 'remember who he is, where he came from.' The father's belief that claiming a better job title would lead to better treatment for his son ('The better my job, the better my son gets treated') suggests an awareness of bias, potentially including racial or class-based discrimination. These elements together indicate that the topic of racism, racial discrimination, or racial prejudice is present or implied in the episode."
H,2,6,HS02E06,No,
H,2,7,HS02E07,Yes,"There are several implicit and explicit references to prejudice and discrimination, particularly around sexual orientation and HIV/AIDS, which often intersect with issues of stigma and social bias similar to racial prejudice. The most direct reference to bigotry is when House accuses Kalvin's father of being a bigot for throwing his son out, referencing the difficulty of 'bragging to your hunting buddies that your son knows all the words to The Wiz,' which is a coded reference to both race and sexuality (The Wiz being a musical with a predominantly Black cast). While the primary focus is on homophobia and HIV stigma, the mention of 'brothers on the down-low' and the dialogue about condom use among Black men ('Brothers on the down-low got to') brings in racialized stereotypes and implicit racial dynamics. Additionally, there are references to systemic issues, such as the hospital's legal department potentially blaming a female doctor for contracting HIV by assuming she's a 'drug user or tramp,' which, while more about gender, can overlap with racialized assumptions in healthcare. Given these implicit references and the guideline to answer 'Yes' if there is any doubt, the answer is Yes."
H,2,8,HS02E08,No,
H,2,9,HS02E09,Yes,"There are several implicit and explicit references to race and racial prejudice in the subtitles. Most notably, there is a conversation about why Dr. Foreman, a Black doctor, was chosen to be in charge, with a character sarcastically suggesting it was because 'she wanted someone black.' Additionally, House refers to Foreman as 'Blackpoleon Blackaparte,' a play on Napoleon Bonaparte that highlights Foreman's race in a mocking way. These references indicate the presence of racial dynamics and bias in the workplace, even if not always overtly hostile. There is also a brief mention of sickle cell disease and the stereotype that it only affects Black people, which is corrected but still brings up racial assumptions in medicine."

H,2,14,HS02E14,Yes,"There is an explicit discussion about organ transplant criteria, where one character sarcastically brings up racial disparities in life expectancy and suggests that African-Americans die younger and would be deprioritized for transplants. This is a direct reference to systemic racial inequalities in healthcare and resource allocation, and the conversation uses the word 'racist' to challenge the fairness of such criteria.

H,2,20,HS02E20,Yes,"There are several implicit references to racism and racial prejudice. The character Foreman, who is Black, is accused of having 'repressed black anger' by House, which is a racially charged stereotype. There is also a discussion about Foreman not liking cops, and House questions whether it's due to his race. Additionally, Foreman is treated with suspicion and his motives are questioned in a way that suggests racial bias. These interactions imply the presence of racial prejudice and stereotypes, even though the topic is not discussed explicitly."
H,2,21,HS02E21,Yes,"There are both explicit and implicit references to race and racial disparities. For example, House explicitly states, 'Foreman's black,' and discusses how certain diseases affect black people more than whites, listing conditions like lupus, gout, glaucoma, etc. There is also a joke where House refers to himself as 'Honky,' which is a racial term. Additionally, the dynamic between Foreman (a Black doctor) and his colleagues, as well as the mention of 'Dr. Bling' as a pet name, could be interpreted as referencing racial stereotypes or microaggressions. The episode also explores how race may affect medical diagnosis and treatment, which touches on systemic inequalities."
H,2,22,HS02E22,No,
H,2,23,HS02E23,Yes,"There are several implicit references to race and racial identity in the subtitles. For example, Leona is described as looking 'just like you, got the same 'fro,' and there is a discussion about whether she is 'a light-skinned black chick or a dark-skinned white chick.' The mention of her experiences after Hurricane Katrina, including losing her home and living on the streets, alludes to systemic inequalities that disproportionately affected Black communities. There are also references to genetic background and ethnicity in the sperm donor conversation, including a joke about 'the Jewish number.' Additionally, the line 'I think the Germans had a similar theory about 60 years ago' refers to eugenics and racial purity, which is a direct reference to racism. While there are no explicit acts of racial discrimination or slurs, the episode contains multiple implicit references to race, racial identity, and systemic issues."

He was curious. He wasn't doing anything his peers weren't doing. His peers at Tuskegee and Willowbrook?' The mention of Tuskegee is a direct reference to the infamous Tuskegee Syphilis Study, a notorious case of racial discrimination and medical racism against Black men in the United States. The dialogue draws a parallel between the character's actions and those historical examples of racist medical abuse, thus bringing up the topic of racism and racial prejudice, both explicitly and implicitly."
H,3,4,HS03E04,Yes,"There is an explicit reference to race and social privilege in the following exchange: 'See, skinny, socially-privileged white people get to draw this neat little circle. Everyone inside the circle is normal. Everyone outside the circle should be beaten, broken and reset, so they can be brought into the circle. Failing that, they should be institutionalized, or worse, pitied.' This dialogue directly discusses racial and social privilege, the concept of 'normalcy,' and the marginalization of those outside the dominant group, which is an implicit commentary on systemic prejudice and discrimination. While the main plot is not about racism, this exchange is a clear reference to racial and social bias."
H,3,5,HS03E05,Yes,"The subtitles contain explicit references to racism and racial prejudice. There is a discussion about the challenges faced by an interracial couple, including a character stating, 'Everybody thinks they're so liberal, but I see how they look at us. White and black, especially black.' Another character describes his father as a 'drunk, pill-popping racist' who broke his arm for dating a black girl. There are also jokes and comments about interracial dating, racial stereotypes, and cultural differences. Additionally, there is a scene where a character suggests he is being targeted by police because he is Latino. These references indicate the presence of both explicit and implicit racism and racial prejudice in the episode."
H,3,6,HS03E06,Yes,"There is an explicit reference to racism in the following exchange: 'The only people you can still make fun of. And Christians. Oh, and black people.' This line directly mentions black people as a group that is still subject to ridicule, which is an explicit acknowledgment of racial prejudice. Additionally, the opening joke refers to a 'sister from Brooklyn,' which may implicitly invoke racial or ethnic stereotypes, though it is not as direct as the aforementioned line."
H,3,7,HS03E07,Yes,"There is an explicit reference to racism and systemic discrimination in the story told by a character about a 'buraku' doctor in Japan. The character explains that the buraku are 'untouchables,' historically discriminated against because their ancestors were slaughterers and gravediggers, and that this doctor was not accepted by the staff due to his background. This is a clear mention of racial/ethnic prejudice and systemic inequality."
H,3,8,HS03E08,No,
H,3,9,HS03E09,No,
H,3,10,HS03E10,Yes,"While there are no explicit discussions of racism or racial discrimination, there are multiple implicit references to prejudice and discrimination based on physical difference, specifically dwarfism. The episode repeatedly depicts characters making jokes, puns, and insensitive comments about dwarfism, such as 'Delightful. Usually we just get the elf jokes this time of year,' 'What flavor dwarfs are you guys?' and 'You want her to overcome adversity. Yes. Then why stop at height? Poke a stick in her eye. Imagine how interesting she'll be then.' These exchanges highlight the experience of being treated as different or lesser due to physical characteristics, which parallels the experience of racial prejudice and discrimination. Additionally, the patient and her mother discuss being used to 'people's idiocy' and being treated as 'freaks,' which further implies a broader theme of prejudice based on inherent traits, including but not limited to race or ethnicity."
H,3,11,HS03E11,No,
H,3,12,HS03E12,No,
H,3,13,HS03E13,Yes,"The episode contains both explicit and implicit references to racism and prejudice. The Romany (Gypsy) family faces suspicion, stereotyping, and mistrust from others, and there are discussions about historical and systemic discrimination against Romany people, including references to laws and experimentation. The family's reluctance to trust doctors is directly linked to past abuses against their ethnic group. There is also a scene where a character uses the slur 'gyp,' which is a derogatory term derived from 'Gypsy.' Additionally, the episode draws parallels to other historical instances of racial discrimination, such as the Tuskegee experiments and Rosa Parks, further highlighting the theme of racial prejudice."
H,3,14,HS03E14,Yes,"There are explicit references to ethnic and religious prejudice in the subtitles. For example, a character says, 'That's one of them Jew names. Ashkenazis are a higher-risk group. ... They killed our Lord. You're gonna trust them?' This is a direct expression of antisemitic stereotypes and prejudice. Additionally, there are implicit references to prejudice and stereotypes regarding gender identity (e.g., 'Tranny nurse is more interesting,' 'The nurse used to be a man. She's not anymore? But we can't talk about that.') While these are more related to transphobia than racism, the explicit antisemitic comments clearly indicate the presence of racial or ethnic prejudice."

H,3,19,HS03E19,Yes,"There is an explicit reference to racism and racial prejudice when Jasper says, 'He said I smelled like a monkey.' The phrase 'smelled like a monkey' is a well-known racial slur and stereotype, particularly when directed at people of African descent, though it can be used more broadly as a racist insult. The context involves a child being insulted and then getting into a fight as a result. This is a clear instance of racial prejudice being mentioned in the episode."
H,3,20,HS03E20,Yes,"There are both explicit and implicit references to racism and racial prejudice in the subtitles. Explicitly, a character says, 'You figure she's a minority, she must be stoned?' in response to an assumption about drug use, directly acknowledging racial bias. Implicitly, the dialogue discusses characters who 'got out of the projects' and the idea that 'the system's not set up for people like me,' referencing systemic inequalities faced by people of color. The character Foreman describes feeling like he doesn't belong and fears being 'sent back,' which alludes to the experience of minorities in predominantly white spaces. The episode also explores stereotypes and prejudices about drug use, criminality, and social mobility associated with race."
H,3,21,HS03E21,Yes,"There is an explicit reference to race and racial disparities in the context of bone marrow donation. The dialogue states: 'They're African American. It makes it nearly impossible to find a full match.' This directly references the difficulty African American patients face in finding bone marrow donors, which is a real-world issue rooted in systemic inequalities and underrepresentation in donor registries. This is an explicit mention of systemic racial disparities in healthcare."

H,3,23,HS03E23,No,
H,3,24,HS03E24,Yes,"There are several implicit references to race and ethnicity, particularly in the depiction of the Cuban couple as refugees from a 'dirt-poor country in the tropics.' There are comments about Castro, Cuba, and the assumption that infectious diseases and parasites are likely causes of illness because of the patient's origin. The line 'Foreman's not the only chocolate-covered cherry in the box' is a racialized joke referencing Foreman's race (he is Black). There are also subtle microaggressions and stereotypes about immigrants, such as questioning the husband's skills and emphasizing their struggle to reach the U.S. for medical care. These elements suggest the presence of racial and ethnic prejudice, both in dialogue and in the framing of the characters."
H,4,1,HS04E01,No,
H,4,2,HS04E02,Yes,"There are implicit references to racial prejudice and discrimination. For example, the phrase 'Just entered Indian Country' is a military slang term with a problematic history, referencing Native American lands as hostile territory, which perpetuates negative stereotypes. Additionally, a character mentions, 'According to the state of New Jersey, medical schools in my country suffer from not being from this country,' which implies discrimination against foreign medical graduates, often rooted in racial or ethnic bias. There is also a pointed remark, 'You're wearing a ring from Brigham Young. Or did your folks just do the lawns?' which is a microaggression implying a stereotype about Latino or immigrant labor. These instances suggest the presence of racial prejudice or discrimination, even if not the central topic."
H,4,3,HS04E03,No,
H,4,4,HS04E04,Yes,"There are several explicit and implicit references to race and racial dynamics in the subtitles. For example, House says, 'Take Bosley and the other visible minority to the funeral home. The rest of you young, white people, the world is your oyster.' This is a direct reference to race and the concept of 'visible minority.' Later, House says, 'Well, I can't ask the black guy or one of the chicks to do it. That would be insensitive.' This acknowledges racial and gender-based sensitivity in assigning tasks, implying awareness of potential discrimination or prejudice. These lines, along with the use of 'visible minority' and references to someone's race or ethnicity in the context of workplace dynamics, suggest the presence of racial topics, even if used satirically or as social commentary."
H,4,5,HS04E05,Yes,"There is an implicit reference to race and racial identity when a character says, 'A black Mormon could help that way. There's no reason for you to want to be there.' This line references the character's race (black) and religion (Mormon) in a context that suggests her identity is unusual or noteworthy in the given situation, which implies awareness of racial difference and possibly stereotype. While there are no explicit discussions of racism or discrimination, this reference to race in a context of motivation and belonging is an implicit nod to racial identity and potential prejudice."
H,4,6,HS04E06,Yes,"There is an implicit reference to racism in the line: 'Someone thought black people made excellent farm implements.'

Explicitly, there's a scene where a character says to another, 'Kutner, you're sort of Asian, right? Get it translated,' which is an example of a microaggression and racial stereotyping. Implicitly, the storyline involving the Chinese birth parents refusing to acknowledge their daughter, the references to China's One Child Policy and the possible attempted infanticide of a girl due to gender, and the discussion about being adopted by a white family and feeling like an outsider all touch on issues of racial discrimination, prejudice, and systemic inequality. Additionally, the phrase 'that's the third time we've passed that colonial with the cross burning out front' is an allusion to racist hate crimes (cross burning being associated with the Ku Klux Klan)."
H,5,5,HS05E05,No,

He specifically says, 'The most common cause of anhedonia is schizophrenia. Sure, in white folk. They're black? They're liars.' This exchange implies an assumption about race and honesty, and then reveals that the family changed their name from 'Jamal Hammoud' to 'Jerry Harmon' due to anti-Arab prejudice after the US invaded Iraq. The need to hide their ethnic identity to avoid discrimination is a clear reference to racial/ethnic prejudice."

You're not athletic. Run to the end of the hall and back, I'll time you.' This is followed by a discussion referencing Sandy Koufax and the Holocaust, which further invokes Jewish identity and stereotypes about Jewish athleticism. These lines suggest the presence of racial/ethnic prejudice, even if framed as humor or banter."
H,5,18,HS05E18,No,
H,5,19,HS05E19,No,
H,5,20,HS05E20,Yes,"There are several implicit references to issues of race and ethnicity, particularly in the discussion about Kutner's background. Kutner was adopted and changed his name from Lawrence Choudhary to Lawrence Kutner, and House suggests he was conflicted about his identity and heritage, saying 'It's hard to still be Lawrence Choudhary when everyone sees you as Lawrence Kutner.' The dialogue explores the challenges of maintaining one's ethnic identity in a predominantly white environment and the pressure to assimilate, which are themes related to racial prejudice and systemic issues. There is also mention of the 'rainbow coalition missing Brown and Bi,' which references racial and ethnic diversity among the team. These elements suggest the presence of racial identity struggles and the implications of racial bias, even if not overtly stated as racism or discrimination."
H,5,21,HS05E21,No,
H,5,22,HS05E22,Yes,"There are implicit references to racial or ethnic prejudice in the subtitles. For example, the line 'a whole new generation of hot girls have been abused by their stepfathers' is a problematic stereotype, and the joke about the NAACP award ('Cuddy doesn't actually want you in charge. She just wants to avoid a lawsuit and to win an NAACP award.') references racial issues in a dismissive way. Additionally, the scene where immigration officials detain Chase and say 'Illegals only' touches on issues of discrimination based on nationality or ethnicity. While there are no explicit discussions of racism, these moments suggest the presence of racial or ethnic prejudice."
H,5,23,HS05E23,No,
H,5,24,HS05E24,No,
H,6,1,HS06E01,Yes,"There are both explicit and implicit references to race and racial issues. Explicitly, there is a line: 'Thought you'd be a little more sensitive on the slavery issue. You can't keep me. And he's black.' This directly references race and the history of slavery. Additionally, there are implicit references: Alvie introduces himself as 'the Puerto Rican version' of a Woody Allen character, and later raps about being a 'manic Hispanic' and how 'the doctors think I'm lazy.' These lines touch on racial and ethnic identity and stereotypes. The episode also features a diverse cast of characters, some of whom discuss or are depicted in ways that reference their racial or ethnic backgrounds."
H,6,2,HS06E02,No,
H,6,3,HS06E03,Yes,"The subtitles contain multiple explicit and implicit references to racism, racial prejudice, and ethnic violence. The central plot involves President Dibala, who is accused of planning genocide against the Sitibi people, an ethnic group. There are references to ethnic slurs ('cockroach'), discussion of mass killings, and the use of youth militias to torture and kill Sitibi people. The dialogue includes characters describing systemic violence, ethnic cleansing, and the targeting of people based on their ethnicity. Additionally, there are references to historical events like Rwanda, which further imply racial/ethnic prejudice and discrimination."
H,6,4,HS06E04,No,
H,6,5,HS06E05,No,
H,6,6,HS06E06,No,
H,6,7,HS06E07,Yes,"There are several references that imply the topic of racism or racial prejudice. The most explicit is the discussion about 'the dead African dictator' and 'Dibala,' which refers to a storyline in which a character (Chase) killed an African leader (Dibala) while he was a patient, and the aftermath involves guilt and moral debate. The dialogue references 'the full horror of his homicide,' 'no one is going to bail us out,' and 'the big, bad, evil climate that allowed it to happen,' which allude to systemic issues and possibly racialized violence. There is also a mention of 'Idi Amin Jr.' and the phrase 'murder,' which further implies racial and political context. Additionally, the mention that 'no transplant committee will say this openly, they'll never grant an organ to someone working in your profession' hints at discrimination, though in this context it's about being a porn actor, not race. However, the storyline about Dibala and the references to an African dictator, murder, and the resulting guilt and moral debate are strong enough to say that the topic of racism or racial prejudice is present or implied."

H,6,19,HS06E19,No,
H,6,20,HS06E20,Yes,"The episode explicitly addresses issues of prejudice and discrimination related to sexual orientation, particularly through the depiction of conversion therapy, which is a form of systemic and institutionalized discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals. While the main focus is on homophobia and the protagonist's struggle with his identity, there are also implicit references to societal and familial pressures to conform to heteronormative expectations. Although the episode does not directly mention racism or racial prejudice, the presence of conversion therapy and the associated discrimination are parallel forms of prejudice and systemic inequality based on identity. Given the instruction to answer 'Yes' if there is any doubt and to include implicit references, the answer is Yes."
H,6,21,HS06E21,Yes,"There is an implicit reference to racial prejudice and systemic discrimination in the subplot involving Juan Alvarez (Alvie), who is Puerto Rican. Despite Puerto Ricans being U.S. citizens, Alvie faces immigration issues and is not believed by authorities, requiring him to prove his citizenship at a special hearing. He explicitly states, 'You know that Puerto Ricans are US citizens, right?... People like that don't listen to people like me.' This dialogue suggests experiences of racial/ethnic bias and systemic barriers, even though no explicit racial slurs or overt racism are present."
H,6,22,HS06E22,No,
H,7,1,HS07E01,No,
H,7,2,HS07E02,Yes,"The episode includes a medical diagnosis of sickle cell trait, a condition that disproportionately affects people of African descent, which is an implicit reference to race. Although there is no explicit discussion of racism or racial prejudice, the presence of sickle cell trait as a plot point can be seen as an implicit reference to race and racialized health disparities. Additionally, the episode explores issues of bias and favoritism (though not specifically racial), but the sickle cell trait storyline is enough to warrant a 'Yes' answer."
H,7,3,HS07E03,Yes,"There is an explicit reference to racial prejudice when a character says 'She hates Jews' after a go-kart incident. This is a direct mention of antisemitism, which is a form of racial or ethnic prejudice. Additionally, there is a brief mention of a maid being 'probably illegal,' which could be interpreted as a microaggression or stereotype based on ethnicity or immigration status, though this is less explicit. The explicit antisemitic remark is sufficient to answer Yes."
H,7,4,HS07E04,No,
H,7,5,HS07E05,Yes,"There are explicit references to race and racial stereotypes in the subtitles. For example, House makes a comment: 'I knew about the Jew, the black and the croc hunter. But when did we get our Asian persuasion on?' and follows it with 'Well, I just wasted a perfectly good racial epithet.' This is a direct, albeit flippant, mention of racial and ethnic identities and the use of racial epithets. Additionally, there is a moment where Foreman, a Black character, is told 'You want me to hire a white girl?' in the context of hiring decisions, which touches on race and potential racial bias in employment. These references, both explicit and implicit, indicate that the topic of racism, racial discrimination, or racial prejudice is present in the episode."
H,7,6,HS07E06,Yes,"The subtitles contain both explicit and implicit references to racism, racial prejudice, and discrimination. The political campaign ad at the beginning uses anti-immigrant rhetoric targeting 'illegal immigrants' and specifically mentions a candidate named John Moreno, implying Latino heritage. The discussion about Latino voters, the significance of the opponent's name being 'Moreno,' and the line 'Black guy campaigning for the opposition? Does Obama know about this? I tried calling him on the Brother Hotline. He didn't pick up.' are explicit references to race and racial identity. The ad and subsequent dialogue play on racial stereotypes and political strategies that exploit racial and ethnic divisions, which are clear examples of racial prejudice and the use of race as a political weapon."
H,7,7,HS07E07,Yes,"The episode explicitly references racism and racial discrimination in several ways. The plot involves a Dutch slave ship, and there is discussion about diseases affecting only the African slaves and not the white crew, with lines such as 'It say only African men sick' and 'The disease doesn't have to be racist, it could be classist.' There is also a sarcastic, racially charged joke about the slaves mowing the speaker's ancestors' lawns. The episode discusses historical systemic inequalities, such as the conditions on slave ships, and diseases disproportionately affecting enslaved Africans due to their treatment. These references, both explicit and implicit, indicate that the topic of racism and racial prejudice is present."
H,7,8,HS07E08,No,
H,7,9,HS07E09,Yes,"There are explicit references to race and racism in the dialogue. For example, one character says, 'That's 'cause I'm black,' in response to not being chosen as the face of the hospital, and another says, 'You seem pretty calm for a guy who's surrounded by racists. 80% of the Princeton population is white. Some are racist, some aren't.' These lines directly address issues of race, racial demographics, and the experience of being a minority in a predominantly white environment, clearly invoking the topic of racism and racial prejudice."

H,7,13,HS07E13,Yes,"There is an implicit reference to race and systemic inequality when a character says, 'Don't you think it's time you people stop looking to the white man to solve all your problems?' This line directly references racial dynamics and stereotypes, implying issues of race, dependency, and possibly prejudice. Additionally, there is a discussion about using connections to get into a prestigious preschool, which can also be read as an implicit reference to systemic inequalities that often have racial dimensions, though this is less explicit. The first example is sufficient to answer Yes."

H,7,17,HS07E17,No,
H,7,18,HS07E18,Yes,"There is an implicit reference to race and racial stereotypes in the exchange: 'This is where a lesser man would make a ""black guy skiing"" joke.' This line acknowledges the existence of racial stereotypes and jokes about Black people and skiing, which is an implicit reference to racial prejudice. No other explicit or implicit references to racism or racial discrimination are present, but this mention is sufficient."
H,7,19,HS07E19,No,
H,7,20,HS07E20,Yes,"There is an implicit reference to racial prejudice in the exchange: 'Can't be easy trying to succeed in a white man's world.' This line acknowledges the existence of systemic racial barriers and bias, particularly as experienced by a Black character (Foreman) in a predominantly white professional environment. The conversation directly references the challenges faced due to race, which constitutes an implicit mention of racism or racial prejudice."

H,7,22,HS07E22,No,
H,7,23,HS07E23,No,
H,8,1,HS08E01,Yes,"There are implicit references to racism and racial prejudice in the episode. For example, there are mentions of prison gangs with Nazi affiliations ('crazy, roided out Nazi bitches', 'swastikas'), and a character ironically claims to be 'a black, gay gypsy' in response to a discussion about ethnicity and identity. The presence of swastikas and Nazi references in a prison context strongly implies the existence of racialized prison gangs and the associated prejudice and discrimination. Additionally, the dialogue includes subtle references to racial and social stereotypes (e.g., 'low lifestyle' as a medical assumption), and the prison environment depicted is one where systemic inequalities and racial dynamics are often present, even if not made explicit in every line."
H,8,2,HS08E02,Yes,"There are several implicit and explicit references to race and potential racial prejudice. For example, House makes a joke about the new team member's ethnicity ('I have no idea what flavor you are, so I thought I'd just cover the spread. My mom's Filipino, Dad's Korean.'), which is a direct reference to her racial background and stereotypes. Additionally, House refers to someone as 'Kato' and 'Black Beauty,' which are both potentially racially charged nicknames. There is also discussion about the character's parents and cultural expectations, which can be tied to experiences of ethnic or racial identity. These references suggest that race and potentially racial prejudice are present or implied in the episode."
H,8,3,HS08E03,No,
H,8,4,HS08E04,Yes,"There are several implicit and explicit references to race and racism in the subtitles. For example, there is a sarcastic remark about moving a company to China 'because I'm craving egg foo yung,' which plays on a Chinese food stereotype. There's also a discussion about child labor in Filipino factories, referencing a '10-year-old cousin' working in an American factory in Cebu City, and the statement that 'the Filipino factories suck worse,' which touches on global labor exploitation often tied to race and ethnicity. Additionally, a character says, 'We only help rich white guys?' and another refers to 'racists and rapists in prison,' indicating the presence of racial issues. There's also a scene where a character corrects a 'drunk, racist frat guy' about the term 'conjoined twin' versus 'Siamese,' referencing both a racial slur and stereotype. These examples show that the episode contains both explicit and implicit references to racism, racial prejudice, and discrimination."
H,8,5,HS08E05,No,
H,8,6,HS08E06,Yes,"There are several implicit and explicit references to race and racial prejudice. For example, there is a line where a character jokes about prison and says, 'when I have an angry black guy waiting for me to drop the soap right here,' which is an explicit reference to racial stereotypes about black men and prison. Additionally, there are microaggressions and stereotypes present in the dialogue, such as the mention of 'Park's tiger mom and dad,' which references an Asian stereotype. These references indicate that the topics of racism, racial discrimination, or racial prejudice are present or implied in the episode."

H,8,22,HS08E22,Yes,"There is an explicit racial reference in the line: 'Just a tiny white lie. No offence. Especially since from what I hear nothing black is tiny. Except your penis, I guess.' This is a racially charged joke referencing stereotypes about Black men and penis size, which constitutes an explicit mention of racial prejudice and stereotyping."
NA,1,1,NAS01E01,Yes,"There are explicit and implicit references to race and racial prejudice. For example, Dr. Goodwin jokes with Dr. Reynolds about Yale secret societies and says 'the one that took a poor black kid,' directly referencing Reynolds' race and background. Later, Reynolds breaks off a relationship with Lauren, saying 'Because you're not black,' and explains his desire for black children and the cultural context of black athletes dating white women, which touches on issues of racial identity, community expectations, and interracial relationships. Additionally, there are references to patients from Liberia and Chiapas, and the challenges faced by undocumented immigrants, which can imply systemic inequalities based on ethnicity and nationality."
NA,1,2,NAS01E02,No,
NA,1,3,NAS01E03,Yes,"There are implicit references to systemic inequalities and racial disparities, particularly in the storyline involving Janelle, a pregnant incarcerated woman. The discussion about her fear of her baby being taken away and placed in foster care, and the solution to keep incarcerated mothers with their newborns, highlights issues of systemic discrimination that disproportionately affect women of color. Additionally, Dr. Reynolds explicitly discusses the underrepresentation of women and women of color in surgical positions, noting that statistics for women of color 'don't exist,' and states his intention to hire women of color first to address this inequity. These elements suggest the presence of racial prejudice and systemic inequality, even though racism is not discussed explicitly."
NA,1,4,NAS01E04,No,
NA,1,5,NAS01E05,Yes,"The subtitles contain multiple explicit and implicit references to racism, racial discrimination, and racial prejudice. Explicitly, a character says, 'stop the police from shooting black boys trying to get to school on time,' directly referencing systemic racism and police violence against Black youth. Another character discusses 'the dangers of walking around in brown skin,' and notes, 'it's a lesson we learn early,' highlighting the lived experience of racial minorities in the U.S. There are also implicit references, such as microaggressions from security staff and the focus on how the shooting victims are treated by police and hospital staff. The episode addresses systemic inequalities, trauma from racialized violence, and the impact of race on safety and health outcomes."
NA,1,6,NAS01E06,Yes,"There are implicit references to racial prejudice and discrimination. For example, one character discusses how their parents avoid visiting their family, which consists of 'two gay dads and their Muslim kids,' and says, 'The truth would be a good start. ""The truth""? That two gay dads and their Muslim kids aren't worthy of love?' This implies the grandparents' rejection is due to both homophobia and Islamophobia, which are forms of prejudice based on sexual orientation and religion/ethnicity. Additionally, there are references to a character being brought back from Bangladesh and concerns about whether the grandparents will accept her and her brothers, which may imply issues of racial or ethnic bias. There is also a scene in the Corrections Ward where a guard refers to the inmates as 'these scum' and 'these bastards,' and the context of the Corrections Ward (often disproportionately affecting people of color) could imply systemic racial prejudice, though this is less explicit."

NA,1,10,NAS01E10,No,
NA,1,11,NAS01E11,Yes,"There are explicit references to racism and racial prejudice in the episode. The most direct example is Dr. Reynolds' story about being arrested on election night despite being a doctor and showing his hospital badge, and how not even his Morehouse College license plate or Yale Med School bumper sticker could save him from being treated as a suspect. He describes being ashamed of the incident and how it was used against him in a profile meant to celebrate a Black doctor, highlighting the prejudice and extra scrutiny faced by African-Americans. Additionally, a character comments, 'It's just so typical. It's like if you're African-American and you're exemplary, they're always looking for a catch,' which directly addresses racial bias and stereotyping. These references make the presence of racism and racial prejudice explicit in the episode."
NA,1,12,NAS01E12,Yes,"There are several implicit references to racism, racial discrimination, and systemic inequality throughout the episode. The discussion about clinical trial candidates needing to be 'as diverse as the country we're aiming to treat' and the comment 'The country I'm trying to treat isn't Finland' suggest awareness of racial and ethnic diversity and the need to include underrepresented groups. The storyline involving Polynesian refugees and the lack of translators for Tuvaluan highlights systemic barriers faced by ethnic minorities. Most explicitly, the depiction of Puerto Rican and other migrant workers being exploited at a vineyard—forced to live in poor conditions, treated 'like animals,' paid 'nothing,' and exposed to health hazards—strongly implies racial and ethnic discrimination and systemic inequality. These workers' experiences reflect real-world patterns of racialized labor exploitation. Therefore, the topic of racism and racial prejudice is clearly present."
NA,1,13,NAS01E13,No,
NA,1,14,NAS01E14,Yes,"There is an explicit mention of racism and racial prejudice in the conversation with Mustafa, the Iraqi interpreter. He describes how, after coming to the US, people looked at him 'like I was a terrorist,' and some even said it to his face. This is a clear depiction of racial prejudice and discrimination based on his ethnicity and perceived background. The episode also touches on themes of not belonging and being treated as an outsider due to race or ethnicity."

NA,2,1,NAS02E01,Yes,"The topic of racism and racial prejudice is explicitly discussed in the episode. There is a conversation about how doctors prescribe pain medication differently based on race, with white patients receiving high grade opioids and black patients often being told to 'tough it out' and given Tylenol, highlighting systemic racial bias in healthcare. Additionally, there are references to discrimination against transgender patients in healthcare, and some dialogue touches on challenges faced by people from marginalized backgrounds (e.g., an intern mentioning it's easier to study at the hospital than in his own neighborhood, which may imply socioeconomic and possibly racial disparities)."
NA,2,2,NAS02E02,Yes,"There are both explicit and implicit references to the topic of racism, racial discrimination, or racial prejudice in these subtitles. Explicitly, there is a discussion about teaching 'The Autobiography of Malcolm X' in a prison classroom, which is described as 'a searing portrait of race in America.' The warden's reaction and censorship of the book further allude to institutional control over discussions of race. Implicitly, the presentation about zip codes and life expectancy in Washington, D.C., references systemic inequalities that are often tied to race and socioeconomic status in the U.S. Additionally, the discussion about inmates lacking educational opportunities and the barriers they face can be seen as touching on systemic racial disparities in the criminal justice and education systems."
NA,2,3,NAS02E03,No,
NA,2,4,NAS02E04,Yes,"There are both explicit and implicit references to racism, racial discrimination, and systemic inequalities throughout the episode. Explicitly, the dialogue discusses mistrust of the medical system among African American men, referencing historical abuses such as the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment and Henrietta Lacks, and the reluctance to trust a 'white guy in the back, handing out pills.' Implicitly, the episode addresses racial health disparities, such as higher rates of hypertension and cardiac disease among African American men, and systemic issues like the city's lead contamination disproportionately affecting a neighborhood, which is a form of environmental racism. The episode also explores microaggressions and the need for culturally competent care."
NA,2,5,NAS02E05,No,
NA,2,6,NAS02E06,Yes,"The episode contains both explicit and implicit references to racism, racial discrimination, and systemic inequalities. Explicitly, there is a moment where a Black female patient calls out a doctor for assuming she was with the other Black women, highlighting the issue of racial profiling. Implicitly, the episode discusses systemic healthcare disparities affecting Black women from Alabama, including lack of access to hospitals, unaffordable healthcare, and preexisting conditions going untreated due to socioeconomic and geographic barriers—issues that disproportionately affect communities of color. There are also references to the historical and cultural relationship between Black women and the church, and a character explicitly states, 'This black family right here ain't being co-opted for anyone's crusade,' pushing back against stereotypes and outside narratives. The episode explores how systemic neglect and lack of resources lead to desperate actions, further implying the impact of racial and social inequities."
NA,2,7,NAS02E07,No,
NA,2,8,NAS02E08,No,
NA,2,9,NAS02E09,Yes,"The subtitles contain several implicit references to systemic racial discrimination and prejudice. The episode focuses heavily on the treatment of female inmates at Rikers Island, a real-life jail known for its disproportionate incarceration of people of color. The storyline highlights inadequate healthcare, neglect (e.g., withholding pap smears and mammograms as punishment), and the consequences of minor offenses (e.g., a woman incarcerated for marijuana possession facing life-threatening medical neglect). These are well-documented aspects of systemic racism in the U.S. criminal justice and healthcare systems. Additionally, the dialogue about how many patients from Rikers have preventable conditions and the lack of resources further implies racial and socioeconomic disparities, as does the mention of trauma and the cycle of incarceration. While there are no explicit racial slurs or direct discussions of race, the context and setting strongly suggest racial discrimination is a core theme."

NA,2,14,NAS02E14,Yes,"The episode explicitly discusses racism, racial prejudice, and microaggressions. A major plotline involves a 13-year-old Black boy, Cephas, whose health issues are linked to the stress of experiencing racism and microaggressions, such as being denied books by a librarian, being given unwanted nicknames, being told he speaks good English, and being singled out in class because of his ethnicity. The episode also addresses systemic issues, such as the lack of a diagnostic code for racism in medical billing, and characters discuss the impact of racism and microaggressions in both personal and institutional contexts."
NA,2,15,NAS02E15,No,
NA,2,16,NAS02E16,Yes,"There are explicit references to racism and racial prejudice in the episode. The character George Whitney is identified as a white nationalist and a white supremacist who committed a terror attack at a Middle Eastern street fair, targeting people based on their ethnicity. The medical staff discuss treating him despite his racist actions, and there is a conversation about not judging patients, but also frustration at having to save the life of someone who tried to kill others for racist reasons. Additionally, there is a historical reference to Bessie Smith dying after being refused service at an all-white hospital, highlighting systemic racial discrimination in healthcare.

NA,3,4,NAS03E04,Yes,"There are several explicit and implicit references to racism, racial discrimination, and racial prejudice in the episode. Explicitly, there is a conversation about the presence of police officers in the hospital, where a Black character recounts being stopped and handcuffed by police while in medical scrubs, and discusses how the presence of police makes people of color, undocumented individuals, and the homeless feel less safe. The dialogue references systemic issues, microaggressions, and the differing impact of police presence on marginalized groups. Additionally, there is a discussion about Korean mourning customs and adoption, touching on issues of ethnic identity and cultural assimilation. These elements together indicate that the topics of racism, racial discrimination, or racial prejudice are present in the episode."
NA,3,5,NAS03E05,Yes,"The topic of racism and racial prejudice is explicitly mentioned and implied in several parts of the episode. Most notably, Rose Castillo, a Filipina character, describes being attacked by 'two white guys' who blamed her for 'bringing the virus to America,' which is a clear reference to anti-Asian hate crimes and racial scapegoating during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, Dr. Kao recounts her own experience of being spat on and shoved in the street during the pandemic, stating 'it was happening to so many of us,' further referencing widespread racial discrimination against Asians. There is also a conversation between a mother and daughter about feeling different due to their skin color, with the daughter saying, 'I've always looked different from the entire family. I've always felt like an outsider,' and the mother responding, 'That's the world saying that, not me, not your family. I've never treated you different.' This dialogue addresses the experience of racial difference and societal prejudice. These examples make the presence of racism and racial prejudice clear in the episode."
NA,3,6,NAS03E06,Yes,"The episode explicitly and repeatedly discusses racism, racial discrimination, and systemic inequalities. Characters talk about ending systemic racism in the hospital, cite health disparities affecting Latinx, Indigenous, and Black women, discuss pay inequities for Black doctors, and refer to microaggressions and stereotypes (e.g., being called 'sister girl,' assumptions about language, being mistaken for a nanny or translator, and being called racial slurs). The episode also addresses the concept of intersectionality, white savior complex, and reparations. There are both explicit and implicit references throughout the subtitles."
NA,3,7,NAS03E07,Yes,"The episode contains explicit and implicit references to discrimination based on sexual orientation and HIV status, which are closely related to broader themes of prejudice and systemic inequality. Specifically, there are discussions about the historical and ongoing exclusion of gay men from donating blood, described as a 'very discriminatory regulation' and 'hate.' The show references how gay men were treated 'like lepers' during the AIDS crisis, and how the healthcare system failed them. Additionally, there are mentions of undocumented and uninsured patients receiving care, which can imply issues of systemic inequity that often intersect with race and ethnicity. While the primary focus is on homophobia and HIV-related stigma, the language and context also touch on broader systems of discrimination and prejudice, which often include racism. Given the presence of these themes and the instruction to answer 'Yes' if there is any doubt, the answer is Yes."
NA,3,8,NAS03E08,Yes,"The episode explicitly discusses racial bias and systemic racism in healthcare, particularly in the context of Black mothers and childbirth. There are references to medical calculators penalizing Black women, higher maternal mortality rates for Black and Latina mothers, and the acknowledgment that these outcomes are due to how people are treated because of their race, not their biology. The dialogue also addresses the impact of racism on patient care and the need to change racist protocols. These are clear and direct references to racism and racial prejudice."
NA,3,9,NAS03E09,Yes,"There are explicit references to racism and racial prejudice in the episode. For example, a white family falsely reports a shooting as a 'drive-by' by a Black or Latino person, which is later revealed to be a cover-up for their own daughter's accidental shooting. The mother references Black Lives Matter protests as the reason for buying a gun, and a character directly calls out the racial profiling and the harm caused by filing a false police report based on race. The dialogue addresses issues of racial bias, profiling, and the impact of systemic racism, making the topic of racism both mentioned and implied."
NA,3,10,NAS03E10,Yes,"The episode contains explicit references to racism and systemic discrimination, particularly regarding the treatment of Native Americans. Professor Munsee discusses the erasure and destruction of her people by colonizers, the impact of the hospital's name (New Amsterdam) as a symbol of that history, and the lack of Native American representation among hospital staff. The episode also addresses broader issues of systemic inequality, such as the barriers Native American students face in pursuing medical careers, and microaggressions (e.g., the difficulty in identifying Native American staff, and a guidance counselor steering a Native student away from medical school). These elements clearly indicate the presence of racism, racial discrimination, and prejudice, both historically and in contemporary contexts."
NA,3,11,NAS03E11,No,
NA,3,12,NAS03E12,No,
NA,3,13,NAS03E13,Yes,"There are explicit references to racism, racial discrimination, and historical medical abuses against Black people in the vaccine distribution storyline. Characters mention Tuskegee, Henrietta Lacks, antebellum, sickle cell anemia screenings, forced sterilization, and night doctors—events and practices that reflect systemic racism and medical exploitation of Black communities. The dialogue addresses mistrust in the healthcare system rooted in these racist histories. Additionally, there is a reference to 'a traditional marriage, a Black family,' which, while not overtly discriminatory, invokes racial identity and cultural expectations. These elements indicate both explicit and implicit engagement with the topic of racism and racial prejudice."
NA,3,14,NAS03E14,Yes,"There are several implicit references to racial and ethnic prejudice and systemic inequalities. For example, Leyla Shinwari, a foreign-trained doctor from Pakistan, faces barriers to obtaining a residency due to her medical school not having 'international standing,' and the fact that she has to redo her residency despite her experience is described as 'offensive.' There is also discussion of her working in refugee camps, and the implication that her background is undervalued. Additionally, there are references to family members from Tehran and issues of cultural and ethnic identity, such as a character's father returning to Iran for a 'ready-made Persian wife.' The clinic's struggles are linked to Brexit and the loss of international staff and funding, which can be seen as referencing systemic issues affecting immigrants and minorities. These elements together suggest the presence of racial and ethnic prejudice and systemic discrimination, even if not always explicitly labeled as such."
NA,4,1,NAS04E01,Yes,"There are a few implicit references to racial issues. First, Dr. Reynolds is introduced to Dr. Lyn Malvo and her husband Claude, which could suggest an interracial or complex relationship dynamic, though not explicitly racial. More notably, in the conversation with Brandon Dover, he describes how 'nobody cared about my education. As long as I could ball. Not the school, not the coaches. I was their meal ticket. It's always been that way, even throughout college. Nobody wanted to hear about my... dyslexia. Couldn't even get it diagnosed.' This reflects the systemic issue where Black athletes, particularly in the U.S., are valued for their athletic abilities over their academic or personal development, a form of systemic racial bias and exploitation. The mention of being a 'meal ticket' and the lack of support for his learning disability are indicative of racialized stereotypes and neglect. Additionally, the episode includes a reference to the 'Order of the Star of Ghana' awarded to Dr. Wilder, which, while not negative, is a reference to race/ethnicity. There are also song lyrics and casual dialogue referencing 'white' and 'sunny yellow,' which could be interpreted as color references, though not overtly racial. Given the implicit references to systemic inequalities and stereotypes, the answer is Yes."
NA,4,2,NAS04E02,No,
NA,4,3,NAS04E03,Yes,"There are several implicit references to systemic inequality and racial bias. For example, Imani Moore, a first-generation immigrant, discusses how surgical site infections are nine times higher in impoverished countries, highlighting global health disparities. She also faces barriers to advancing her medical innovation due to lack of generational wealth and the influence of a powerful corporation (NovaCo) that could block her from attending medical school, which alludes to systemic inequalities that disproportionately affect people from marginalized backgrounds. Additionally, Leyla, who trained in Kashmir, references her experience performing medical procedures in war-torn conditions, implicitly touching on issues of global inequality and the challenges faced by medical professionals from less privileged regions. While there are no explicit discussions of racism or racial slurs, these storylines clearly imply issues of racial and systemic discrimination."
NA,4,4,NAS04E04,Yes,"The episode explicitly addresses issues of racism, racial prejudice, and systemic inequality. Examples include: (1) A biracial child taking skin lightening pills due to struggles with her racial identity and experiences of being racially excluded and gaslit at a dance tournament; (2) Discussion of how being the only person of color in a white family and community affects her; (3) Dialogue about how women of color are labeled 'crazy or difficult' for disruptive behavior, while white men are praised; (4) Reference to redlining and its impact on the neighborhood's lack of investment and food deserts; (5) A character's efforts to address systemic racism and bias in the hospital, and the backlash from others who claim it alienates white patients. These are clear and direct references to racism, racial discrimination, and prejudice, both individual and systemic."
NA,4,5,NAS04E05,Yes,"There are several implicit and explicit references to racism, racial discrimination, and prejudice in these subtitles. The conversation about the Lenapehoking plaque being replaced and the comment about 'whitewashing' are direct references to the erasure of Indigenous history and culture, which is a form of systemic racism. The subplot involving the Burmese harp (saung-gauk) and the patient's experience as a refugee also touches on cultural looting, displacement, and the trauma of colonialism, which are deeply tied to racial and ethnic discrimination. Additionally, there is a mention of the Black Lives Matter mural and the importance of representation for marginalized groups in the hospital. These elements together indicate that the episode addresses issues of racism and racial prejudice, both explicitly and implicitly."
NA,4,6,NAS04E06,Yes,"There is an explicit reference to race in the line 'Strong and black like your woman,' which is a play on the phrase 'strong and black' (often used for coffee) and references a Black woman. This line invokes racial identity in a stereotypical or potentially objectifying way. While the rest of the subtitles do not contain further explicit or implicit references to racism or racial prejudice, this line alone is enough to warrant a Yes."
NA,4,7,NAS04E07,Yes,"There are several implicit references to systemic racial inequalities and discrimination. For example, the discussion about private ambulance companies only picking up insured patients, leaving the uninsured, homeless, and poor (who are disproportionately people of color) for the public hospital, is an allusion to systemic inequalities and racialized healthcare disparities. Additionally, the mention of the NYPD's quota system leading to the mass incarceration of Black and brown people is a direct reference to systemic racism. The sickle cell screening program, which is particularly relevant to Black patients, being cut due to funding and not reinstated, also suggests racial disparities in healthcare access. These references indicate that the episode addresses issues of racism and racial prejudice, even if not always explicitly."
NA,4,8,NAS04E08,Yes,"There is an explicit reference to race and racial dynamics when Dr. Sharpe tells Dr. Kao, 'As a woman of color, do you realize the rarefied air you are in?' This acknowledges the underrepresentation of people of color in positions of power at top medical institutions, and implies the existence of systemic racial inequalities. Additionally, the phrase 'she's been pitting me against Baptiste playing us off each other. A real ""there can only be one"" vibe.' could be interpreted as an allusion to the 'tokenism' often experienced by minorities in professional settings, though this is less explicit. These references suggest that the episode touches on issues of race and racial prejudice, both explicitly and implicitly."
NA,4,9,NAS04E09,Yes,"The episode explicitly addresses issues of racial and ethnic discrimination, particularly through the experiences of undocumented immigrants facing ICE raids and the threat of deportation. The fear and trauma experienced by these characters, the discussion of sanctuary and protection, and the references to being targeted due to immigration status all point to systemic prejudice and discrimination based on ethnicity and national origin. Additionally, there are references to a Nigerian trans man who experienced violence in his home country, which also touches on intersectional discrimination. The episode implicitly and explicitly deals with themes of racial and ethnic prejudice, systemic inequality, and the marginalization of vulnerable groups."
NA,4,10,NAS04E10,Yes,"There are implicit references to racial prejudice and systemic bias. In particular, a character mentions that when the dean saw an application from a doctor who trained in Pakistan at a hospital he never heard of, he stopped reading, implying bias against foreign-trained (and likely non-white) doctors. The same conversation discusses the need for a large donation to secure a residency spot, suggesting systemic barriers for international or minority candidates. Additionally, the mention of Vivien Thomas, a Black medical pioneer, as a hero and the gifting of his stethoscope could be seen as a nod to overcoming racial barriers in medicine. While there are no explicit racial slurs or overt acts of racism, these elements suggest the presence of racial prejudice and systemic inequality."

NA,4,13,NAS04E13,Yes,"There is an explicit reference to racism when Helen confronts her mother about her father, saying, 'And then you spent the next 30 years telling me that he abandoned us, that he's a racist, that he didn't love me. That lie shaped my entire future...' This indicates that accusations of racism and its impact on family dynamics are a topic in the episode. Additionally, the mention of being the only deaf kid in a hearing family and the challenges faced could implicitly touch on prejudice or feeling like an outsider, though this is more about ableism than racism. The explicit mention, however, is sufficient to answer Yes."

NA,4,17,NAS04E17,Yes,"There is an explicit reference to racial discrimination and systemic inequality in the conversation about hysterectomies being overperformed for decades on people who 'look like me,' which implies racial bias in medical treatment. Additionally, the subplot about Leyla's refugee status and the challenges she faces with immigration due to new laws and lack of legal aid implicitly references systemic discrimination that disproportionately affects people from certain racial or ethnic backgrounds. Both of these are clear indications of the presence of topics related to racism and racial prejudice."
NA,4,18,NAS04E18,Yes,"There are both explicit and implicit references to issues of race and potential racial discrimination. Specifically, the episode discusses a character whose refugee status is being revoked and who may be sent back to Pakistan, which can imply issues of racial or ethnic discrimination in immigration systems. Additionally, there are references to medical billing and insurance challenges that disproportionately affect people of color and immigrants, such as the character Mr. Azad (a name of South Asian origin) being overcharged and facing barriers to care. While the episode does not use racial slurs or overtly discuss racism, these storylines suggest the presence of systemic inequalities and potential racial prejudice."

The backs of your ancestors, that's where. Sugar plantations. Colonial slavery.' This directly addresses the exploitation and racial oppression that funded the estate, acknowledging the impact of colonialism and slavery on their family history.

The characters note that 89% of participants were Caucasian, and they discuss how this non-diverse participant pool does not reflect the general population or the hospital's patient population. They raise concerns that the drug may not be safe or effective for people who are not white, referencing historical medical bias and systemic inequalities in healthcare. The episode also depicts efforts to correct this by expanding the trial to include underrepresented groups, such as Native American, African American, Asian, Latinx, and Middle Eastern populations. These discussions and actions directly address issues of racial bias and systemic discrimination in medicine."

The storyline involves the identification and tracking of babies by race, which implicitly references racial categorization and the potential for bias or differential treatment. Additionally, there is a joke referencing 'Kunta Kinte' and 'Roots,' which alludes to African-American history and identity.

Additionally, the discussion of aid work in Africa and references to living conditions (e.g., 'living under a veil in a clay hut') invoke stereotypes and highlight global inequalities.

For example, the discussion of the victim's criminal record, the reference to the neighborhood cops being 'jerks' growing up, and the concern about public perception when 'a cop shoots an unarmed kid' all echo common themes in real-world conversations about police shootings of young men of color. The mention of 'the whole world is watching you, maybe even against you' and the way the shooting is being 'twisted' in the papers further suggest the racialized scrutiny and controversy that often surrounds such incidents.

This is an example of discrimination based on a neurological condition, which, while not racial, is a form of prejudice. However, since the instructions say to include both explicit and implicit references and to answer Yes if there is any doubt, and since there are multiple references to the ethnicity of patients (e.g., 'Caucasian male') but no explicit or implicit mention of racism, racial discrimination, or racial prejudice, the closest relevant content is the discrimination based on autism.

These lines suggest awareness of racial and gender bias in the workplace, and how being a Black woman makes it more difficult to be taken seriously or to seek justice.

These elements directly address issues of racial, ethnic, and cultural prejudice, as well as the intersection of systemic and interpersonal discrimination related to race, ethnicity, and cultural practices."

The dialogue discusses adoption, deportation, and cultural differences, such as respect for elders and cultural practices. Esther's statement about 'those people' turning Madeline against her culture and herself, and the reference to sacrifices made by both her birth and adoptive families, touch on issues of identity, belonging, and the impact of systemic issues like deportation, which often have racial and ethnic dimensions. Additionally, the mention of Cameroon and the cultural expectations around names and respect further highlight racial and ethnic themes.

Discussions between Mr. Song and his daughter Emily reference being seen as 'different,' 'outsiders,' and 'the world sees us as other.' Mr. Song mentions selling hammers to 'people who hate me' and keeping his head down as a survival strategy, reflecting experiences of racial prejudice and microaggressions.

This dialogue directly addresses the unique difficulties and systemic barriers faced by people of color, particularly Black women, in medicine, which implies the presence of racial prejudice and discrimination.

Another character, Kevin, is bullied and abused in a group home due to his dyslexia, with the abuse taking the form of a 'game' where he is set up to fail and then physically hurt. While this is primarily ableism, the mention of the group home, the lack of foster families willing to take in teenagers with a history of running away, and the systemic challenges faced by Kevin may also imply systemic inequalities often associated with race and class, though not stated outright. Additionally, the episode includes discussions of microaggressions and sexism in the workplace, which, while not racial, are related forms of prejudice.

Additionally, another character mentions that it took days to convince doctors she wasn't an addict during a sickle cell crisis, which may imply racial bias in medical treatment, as Black patients with sickle cell disease often face skepticism and undertreatment due to racial prejudice."

We're shutting our doors. Given the political unrest and the quality of health care available in Nigeria, you might want to reconsider.' This is an example of leveraging her immigrant status in a way that suggests systemic bias and power imbalance. Additionally, when Dr. Conrad Hawkins meets Dr. Devon Pravesh, he makes a pointed comment: 'What are you into? White, black? Brown? Men? ... Were you affirmative action at Harvard?' This directly references race and implies a stereotype about Dr. Pravesh's qualifications, which is an example of racial microaggression and prejudice."

TR,1,3,TRS01E03,Yes,"The episode explicitly addresses issues of racial and ethnic discrimination through the storyline of Louisa Rodriguez, an undocumented immigrant from El Salvador. Louisa fears deportation and is denied access to charitable medical care because she is not a U.S. citizen, reflecting systemic inequalities and prejudice against immigrants. The hospital administration debates her value in financial terms and attempts to transfer her to avoid costs, showing institutional bias. The involvement of immigration authorities (ICE) and the discussion of her undocumented status further highlight the challenges faced by people of certain ethnic backgrounds in accessing healthcare and being treated equitably."

The dialogue includes the phrase 'Damn oyibo savior complex,' where 'oyibo' is a Nigerian term for a white person, suggesting awareness of racial dynamics and savior complexes. Additionally, Dr. Okafor discusses the lack of healthcare access in her community and references her uncle's death in Nigeria due to inadequate medical resources, highlighting global and local disparities that often have racial and ethnic dimensions. The episode also touches on the closure of local clinics in underserved (often minority) communities for profit reasons, which is an example of systemic inequality.

There is also a significant subplot involving the Indian-American character Devon Pravesh and his family, which discusses issues of class, caste, and immigrant experience, including assumptions and microaggressions about his family's background ('Folks hear the accent and assume that he's beneath them'). The episode also touches on broader systemic inequalities, such as the illegal dumping of homeless patients by hospitals, which can disproportionately affect marginalized racial and socioeconomic groups.

Dr. AJ Austin, a Black cardiothoracic surgeon, is introduced with emphasis on his exceptional skill, which can sometimes be a marker for discussing underrepresentation or bias in medicine. There are also references to ex-cons being hired by Claudia, and the group of her supporters (Felix, Mambo, Raq) are coded as people of color and former criminals, which touches on racialized stereotypes and systemic barriers to employment. Claudia is described as 'uninsured,' and there is concern about her being 'turfed' from the hospital, which can reflect systemic healthcare disparities that disproportionately affect racial minorities. The dialogue about raising money for an expensive drug for an uninsured patient, and the involvement of police and ex-cons in the fundraising, further hints at systemic inequalities. Additionally, Dr. Austin's monologue about his background—being adopted by parents who 'look like Chow Yun-Fat' and 'Mary J. Blige,' and being 'left-for-dead'—touches on issues of racial identity, adoption, and feeling discarded by society. While there are no explicit mentions of racism or racial slurs, the episode contains implicit references to racial prejudice, stereotypes, and systemic discrimination."

Notably, Dr. AJ Austin refers to Micah as 'the brother' and comments on 'the cast of Deliverance assisting,' which could be interpreted as a reference to the racial makeup or stereotypes of the surgical team. The use of 'the brother' is a colloquial term often used to refer to a Black man, and the 'Deliverance' comment alludes to rural white stereotypes. While these are not overt acts of racism or discrimination, they do invoke racial identity and stereotypes, suggesting the presence of racial dynamics in the episode."
TR,2,1,TRS02E01,Yes,"There are a few implicit references to race and racial identity. The line 'Are you willing to lay your head next to mine as Bell lowers a steel blade to the back of our beautiful ebony necks?' references the character's Black identity, and the use of 'ebony' in this context may allude to the risks Black professionals face in high-stakes environments, which can be read as a subtle nod to systemic or workplace bias. Additionally, there are brief references to characters' ethnic backgrounds (e.g., 'half Asian girl' when describing Phoebe).

There are also discussions about being on a billboard as a black doctor, and a character is told he is only 'filling a quota.' The episode also depicts microaggressions and systemic bias, such as skepticism about the competence of doctors of color and threats from racist characters.

This dialogue directly addresses anti-Asian racism and xenophobia related to COVID-19.

There is a conversation between two Black surgeons (Cain and another character) about being 'discounted' regardless of their talent, referencing the racial barriers and discrimination they face in the medical field. The phrase 'system that's been rigged against us' and the discussion of 'systemic racism' further make the topic explicit. Additionally, Devon shares a story about his father dying in an under-resourced public hospital in a 'poor brown neighborhood,' pointing to systemic racial inequalities in healthcare.

This conversation alludes to the real-world issue of racial and socioeconomic disparities in healthcare access and outcomes. Additionally, there is a brief exchange where one character refers to another as 'brother,' which, in context, may be a nod to shared experiences as people of color in the medical system. There are also references to immigration issues affecting Dr. Mina, which can intersect with racial and ethnic discrimination. While there are no explicit mentions of racism or racial slurs, the episode does touch on themes of systemic inequality and bias."

There is also a discussion about the lack of Nigerian surgeons and the crumbling healthcare system in Nigeria, which is linked to the 'brain drain' phenomenon often exacerbated by global inequalities and immigration policies. Additionally, there is a storyline involving a patient with sickle cell disease, a condition that disproportionately affects people of African descent, and the narrative acknowledges the historical and ongoing medical challenges faced by such patients. While there are no explicit racial slurs or overt acts of racial prejudice, the episode addresses systemic issues and the lived experiences of characters of color, which are relevant to the topics of racism and racial discrimination."
TR,4,10,TRS04E10,Yes,"The episode contains several explicit and implicit references to race and racial issues. There are discussions about setting up marriages between Indian Americans, which touches on ethnic community dynamics. The sickle cell storyline explicitly references sickle cell anemia as a 'predominantly African American disease' and discusses the under-served population, historical medical exploitation (Tuskegee syphilis experiment, Henrietta Lacks), and systemic inequalities in healthcare. Characters from Nigeria and India are depicted, and the challenges faced by immigrants (visa expiration, returning to Nigeria) are mentioned. These elements together suggest the presence of race-related topics, including systemic inequalities and the impact of race on medical treatment and opportunities."
TR,4,11,TRS04E11,Yes,"There are several implicit references to race and ethnicity in the episode. Sammie is a Chinese girl adopted by a white American family, and there is discussion about her not picking up English quickly, her biological parents, and ultimately her adoptive parents considering relinquishing her due to the challenges of her care. These elements touch on issues of transracial adoption, cultural adjustment, and potentially racialized expectations or biases. Additionally, there is a patient with sickle cell disease (Rose Williams), a condition that disproportionately affects Black people, and her care is discussed. There are also references to Dr. Sutton being Indian and her father's expectations, which touch on cultural and possibly racial stereotypes. While there are no explicit discussions of racism or racial prejudice, the episode contains implicit references to race, ethnicity, and related challenges."

TR,5,4,TRS05E04,Yes,"The topic of racism, racial discrimination, or racial prejudice is both explicitly mentioned and depicted in the episode. There is a scene where two Black characters are pulled over by a police officer, and one of them directly calls out the racial profiling ('all you see is two Black men in a car that's a little too nice, so it must be stolen, right?'), referencing the stereotype that Black men in nice cars are assumed to be criminals. The phrase 'driving-while-Black' is used, and the aftermath includes questioning by other officers, with a character stating, 'if we were white, we'd never be hands on the hood for a damn taillight.' These are clear references to racial bias and systemic racism in policing. Additionally, there is a discussion about the impact of these experiences and the idea of 'excellence as revenge' in the face of ignorance, further exploring the theme of racial prejudice."
TR,5,5,TRS05E05,Yes,"There is an explicit reference to systemic inequality and privilege in the following exchange: 'And what was your punishment? There was none. Because the white coat is a shield. So you got away with it.' This dialogue acknowledges that certain individuals (in this case, a doctor) are protected from consequences due to their position and status, which can be interpreted as a parallel to discussions of privilege and systemic inequality, often present in conversations about racism and discrimination. Additionally, the episode features a Black doctor (Dr. Austin, 'Raptor') and a patient named Ethan who is also Black, but there are no explicit racial slurs, stereotypes, or direct discussions of racial bias. However, the reference to privilege and lack of accountability for those in power is an implicit nod to systemic issues, which can include racial dimensions. Given the instruction to answer 'Yes' if there is any doubt, the answer is Yes."

TR,6,2,TRS06E02,Yes,"There are both explicit and implicit references to racism and racial prejudice in the subtitles. Explicitly, during the polling station scene, a character says 'I'm not your brother. Go back to where you came from,' which is a racially charged phrase often used to express xenophobia or racism, especially towards people perceived as immigrants or minorities. The response, 'Came from Atlanta, gringo. Where are you from?' further highlights racial and ethnic tensions. Additionally, the mention of 'Proud Boy' (a group associated with far-right and racist ideologies) and the discussion of Georgia's new voting laws, which have been widely criticized for disproportionately affecting minority voters, are implicit references to systemic racial discrimination and prejudice."
TR,6,3,TRS06E03,Yes,"There are implicit references to systemic inequalities and potential racial or socioeconomic prejudice. Specifically, when the hospital staff discuss how private hospitals like Yates divert gunshot wound victims (who are assumed to be poor and uninsured) to public hospitals, while accepting better-insured blunt trauma victims. This highlights a form of systemic discrimination that often disproportionately affects racial minorities and the poor, even if race is not explicitly mentioned. The discussion about assumptions regarding patients' insurance status and the allocation of resources based on those assumptions suggests implicit bias and systemic inequity, which are closely tied to issues of racial and socioeconomic prejudice."

For example, the episode discusses the poor quality of prison healthcare and how prisoners are not 'top priority,' which often disproportionately affects people of color in the U.S. Additionally, there is a storyline about a character being wrongfully convicted based on DNA evidence, which touches on issues of wrongful convictions that are often linked to racial bias in the justice system. While race is not explicitly mentioned, these themes are strongly associated with racial discrimination and systemic racism."
