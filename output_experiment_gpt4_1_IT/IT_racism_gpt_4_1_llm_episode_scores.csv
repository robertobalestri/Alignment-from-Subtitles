Braccialetti Rossi,2,2,Braccialetti RossiS02E02,-2,"The episode contains a scene in which a character (Chicco) is subjected to repeated ethnic stereotyping and microaggressions by other characters, who conflate his Filipino identity with being Chinese and make jokes about Asian names and martial arts. These comments are presented as banter and are not meaningfully challenged or critiqued by the narrative or other characters. The episode does not provide any narrative framing that signals these behaviors are problematic, nor does it offer counter-examples or critical engagement with the issue. The racialized dynamics are normalized as part of everyday interactions, and the affected character's attempts to correct the misidentification are dismissed. The rest of the episode does not address racism or racial identity in other contexts, and the overall tone suggests indifference or acceptance of such bias.","I did not assign a -3 because, while the episode does present racially discriminatory attitudes and microaggressions, it does not go so far as to explicitly endorse or reward these behaviors. The characters making the comments are not overtly portrayed as positive role models, and the narrative does not actively legitimize racial hierarchies or present racism as justified or desirable. The discrimination is normalized, but not explicitly validated.","I did not assign a -1 because the episode does not merely minimize or omit racial issues; it actively includes and normalizes racialized jokes and stereotypes without critique. The problematic content is not reframed as accidental or isolated, nor is there any narrative attempt to downplay structural causes—rather, the episode treats these microaggressions as unremarkable, indicating a deeper normalization of racial inequality.",OK,"There are implicit references to racial prejudice and stereotyping. In one scene, a character named Chicco is assumed to be Chinese, and other characters make jokes about his name and background, conflating 'Filippino' with 'Chinese' and making stereotypical comments about Asian names and martial arts ('Chin-Chan-Pai, Cheung-Ful, Cheung-Cherin...'). The character has to correct them, saying he is Filipino, not Chinese, but the others dismiss the distinction ('Filippino-cinese sempre asiatico sei'). This exchange relies on racial and ethnic stereotypes and demonstrates microaggressions and ignorance about Asian identities, which are forms of racial prejudice."
Braccialetti Rossi,2,5,Braccialetti RossiS02E05,0,"The episode contains a single, brief instance of racial stereotyping: a Filipino boy is described as 'tutto cicciottello' and compared to 'Kung Fu Panda,' invoking physical and cultural stereotypes. However, this is not thematized, discussed, or challenged by the narrative or other characters. The rest of the episode is devoid of explicit or implicit engagement with race or racism; there are no other references to racial identity, discrimination, or dynamics. Thus, the dominant representational stance is one of implicit presence without clear positioning: the theme appears in a minor way, but is neither endorsed, normalized, nor critically addressed.","I did not assign -1 because the episode does not systematically minimize or omit racial issues that would plausibly be relevant; the single instance is not reframed or downplayed, but simply left unaddressed. Nor does the episode present diversity as merely cosmetic or consistently reframe racial tensions as about other factors.","I did not assign +1 because, aside from the isolated stereotype, there is no acknowledgment, recognition, or exploration of racial dynamics, bias, or discrimination. The episode does not show awareness or concern about racial issues, nor does it feature authentic experiences of minoritized groups or hint at structural dimensions.",OK,"There is an implicit reference to race and possible racial stereotyping in the conversation about 'il ragazzo filippino, tutto cicciottello. Con quel faccione sembra Kung Fu Panda.' This description of a Filipino boy using physical stereotypes and comparing him to a cartoon character with Asian features suggests the presence of racial stereotyping and potentially racial prejudice. While the rest of the episode does not contain explicit discussions of racism or racial discrimination, this instance is enough to warrant a 'Yes' answer."
Crimini bianchi,1,7,Crimini bianchiS01E07,-2,"The episode contains explicit and implicit instances of racial prejudice and systemic discrimination, particularly in the way some characters speak about and interact with immigrants and people of color. For example, there are derogatory remarks about Nigerian and Albanian patients, and the undocumented status of immigrant patients is treated as a bureaucratic inconvenience rather than a human rights issue. These attitudes are presented as ordinary and go largely unchallenged within the narrative. While there is some empathy shown towards Manuela and her daughter Alicia, the overall framing normalizes the marginalization and hardships faced by foreign workers, with little critical engagement or narrative challenge to the prejudices expressed. The episode does not endorse racism outright (-3), but it does present racialized dynamics as unremarkable and fails to problematize or critique them, fitting the description of -2: normalization of racial inequality.","I did not assign -3 because, although there are explicit racist statements and prejudices, the episode does not actively endorse or reward discriminatory attitudes. The racist remarks are not celebrated or presented as virtuous, and there is some narrative sympathy for the immigrant characters. The narrative does not frame racial hierarchies as justified or desirable, but rather leaves them unexamined.","I did not assign -1 because the episode does not simply minimize or omit racial issues; instead, it presents racialized dynamics and prejudices as routine and unremarkable, without narrative critique or challenge. The prejudices expressed are not reframed as misunderstandings or isolated incidents, but are shown as part of the everyday environment, with little to no acknowledgment of their problematic nature.",OK,"There are explicit references to racism and racial prejudice in the subtitles. For example, a character refers to 'le nigeriane che dalla mattina alla sera ti rompono i coglioni per un po' di cortisone... per sbiancarsi la pelle' and makes derogatory comments about Albanians. There is also discussion about undocumented immigrants not being registered as patients, and the hardships faced by foreign workers like Manuela and her daughter Alicia. These elements indicate both explicit and implicit racial prejudice and systemic discrimination."
Crimini bianchi,1,9,Crimini bianchiS01E09,+1,"The episode acknowledges the presence of racial dynamics, particularly through the storyline involving Tuia and her Chinese-Italian family. There are explicit references to the Chinese community's reluctance to 'mischiarsi con noi' (mix with us), the challenges Tuia faces as a member of an immigrant community, and the violence she experiences from her own family to 'save face.' The narrative depicts microaggressions, cultural barriers, and the difficulties of living 'da stranieri' (as foreigners) in Italy. However, while these issues are recognized and depicted, the episode does not offer a sustained or deeply analytical critique of racism as a systemic or institutional problem. The structural and cultural challenges are acknowledged, but not explored in depth or with a transformative lens.","I did not assign a 0 because the episode goes beyond mere implicit presence or ambivalence. It directly references racial discrimination, cultural barriers, and the lived experiences of ethnic minorities in Italy. The dialogue includes explicit mentions of discrimination and the challenges faced by immigrants, indicating a clear recognition of racial dynamics.","I did not assign a +2 because, while the episode recognizes and depicts racial issues, it does not critically engage with the broader causes, consequences, or systemic nature of racial inequality. The narrative does not center the voices of marginalized groups in a way that invites sustained reflection or critique of institutional racism. The exploration of race remains largely at the level of individual experience and interpersonal dynamics, rather than offering a deeper or more analytical engagement.",OK,"There are both explicit and implicit references to racism and racial prejudice. Explicitly, there are discussions about the Chinese community not wanting to 'mischiarsi con noi' (mix with us), and the difficulties Tuia faces as a member of the Chinese community in Italy, including her reluctance to seek medical help and the violence she experiences from her own family to 'save face' in the community. There are also comments about living 'da stranieri' (as foreigners) in Italy, and the episode explores the challenges and microaggressions faced by immigrants and ethnic minorities. The mention of 'discriminazioni razziali' (racial discrimination) in a joking context further suggests the presence of the theme."
Cuori,1,12,CuoriS01E12,+1,"The episode contains a brief but explicit reference to prejudice based on origins in the exchange: 'Tu non vali meno di nessuno dei tuoi colleghi, nonostante tutto.' 'Nonostante cosa? Le mie origini, eh?' This indicates that the character perceives their background (potentially ethnic or racial) as a factor in how they are viewed. However, this theme is not developed further: the episode does not explore systemic or structural racism, nor does it offer a sustained critique or deep engagement with racial dynamics. The rest of the episode focuses on professional, personal, and medical storylines without returning to the topic. Thus, the dominant stance is one of recognition that racial or ethnic bias exists, but without critical analysis or transformative framing.","I did not assign a 0 because the episode does not merely present ambiguous or implicit racial dynamics; it includes an explicit acknowledgment of prejudice based on origin. Nor is the theme minimized or omitted (-1), as the character directly names the issue.","I did not assign a +2 because the episode does not critically engage with racism as a social problem, examine its causes or consequences, or invite reflection on structural or institutional dimensions. The reference to prejudice is brief and not thematized in the narrative as a whole, nor are multiple perspectives or deeper analyses presented.",OK,"There is an implicit reference to racial or ethnic prejudice in the following exchange: 'Tu non vali meno di nessuno dei tuoi colleghi, nonostante tutto.' 'Nonostante cosa? Le mie origini, eh?' This suggests that the character feels or is made to feel that their background or origins (potentially ethnic or racial) are a factor in how they are perceived or treated, which implies the presence of prejudice or discrimination based on origin, which can include race or ethnicity."
Cuori,2,12,CuoriS02E12,0,"The episode contains a single, brief reference to race: 'Oddio, ma se era nera lo sa sta cosa. Anche lei sarà tutta affezionata a quella bambina.' This line acknowledges the child's Black identity, but does so in a context where her race is otherwise irrelevant to the plot. The mention is not explored, critiqued, or thematized further. There are no explicit acts of racism, nor is there any narrative framing that signals a clear position on racial issues. The rest of the episode focuses on medical, personal, and relational dramas without engaging with race or racism. Thus, the theme of racism is implicitly present, but not addressed or positioned, fitting the definition for a score of 0.","I did not assign -1 because the episode does not systematically minimize or omit racial issues that would plausibly be relevant in its context. The one mention of race is offhand and not reframed as accidental or isolated, nor is there evidence of the episode downplaying structural causes or consistently attributing disparities to individual factors. The episode simply does not engage with race beyond the single ambiguous remark.","I did not assign +1 because, aside from the single line referencing the child's race, there is no acknowledgment or exploration of racial dynamics, bias, or discrimination. The episode does not recognize or thematize race as shaping experiences or relationships, nor does it provide authentic perspectives from minoritized groups. The narrative remains neutral and non-committal regarding racial issues.",OK,"There is an implicit reference to race and possible racial prejudice in the line: 'Oddio, ma se era nera lo sa sta cosa. Anche lei sarà tutta affezionata a quella bambina.' This suggests the child in question is Black ('nera'), and the way it is mentioned in the context of concern or surprise could imply underlying assumptions or biases about race. While there are no explicit acts of racism or discrimination described, the mention of the child's race in a context where it is otherwise irrelevant suggests an implicit reference to racial difference, which could be tied to prejudice or stereotyping."
Doc Nelle tue mani,1,8,Doc Nelle tue maniS01E08,+2,"The episode critically engages with racial inequality and racism through multiple narrative threads. The storyline involving Nureddin, a Libyan migrant, and the explicit recounting of human trafficking, torture, and exploitation in Libya foregrounds the realities of racialized violence and systemic discrimination faced by migrants. The episode also references assumptions about ethnicity, skin color, and diseases more common in 'Africa mediterranea,' highlighting both implicit and explicit biases. The narrative does not merely acknowledge these issues but examines their causes and consequences, gives voice to affected characters (notably the Ethiopian doctor sharing his motivation rooted in witnessing preventable deaths), and holds perpetrators accountable (the trafficker faces the prospect of justice). The episode invites reflection on how race and migration shape access to safety, health, and justice, and incorporates institutional and historical contexts. However, the engagement, while critical and multi-perspective, remains within the framework of medical drama and personal stories, without fully centering a transformative or systemic critique.","A score of +1 would be insufficient because the episode goes beyond mere recognition or surface acknowledgment of racial dynamics. It explicitly addresses racism, discrimination, and their impacts, and provides narrative space for affected individuals to articulate their experiences and perspectives. The episode also problematizes the indifference or complicity of bystanders and explores the moral dilemmas faced by those who have suffered racialized violence.","A score of +3 would require a sustained, analytical, or transformative framing of race and racism, with the narrative actively promoting structural critique, exploring intersectionality in depth, or outlining pathways to equity and reconciliation. While the episode is critical and reflective, its engagement is primarily at the level of individual stories and institutional accountability within the hospital context. It does not fully develop a broader, systemic analysis or propose transformative solutions, nor does it consistently center marginalized voices as authoritative throughout the narrative.",OK,"There are several implicit and explicit references to racism, racial prejudice, and discrimination. For example, the patient Nureddin is noted as being originally from Libya, and there is discussion about diseases more common in people from 'Africa mediterranea.' There is also a significant storyline involving a character who was a victim of human trafficking and torture in Libya, which includes references to the mistreatment of migrants and their families. Additionally, there are subtle references to assumptions about ethnicity and background (e.g., 'Tu sei nato qui! Tu non sei niente.' and the discussion of abbronzatura/skin color as a clue to someone's origins). These elements together suggest the presence of racial prejudice, discrimination, and the consequences of systemic inequalities."
Doc Nelle tue mani,2,10,Doc Nelle tue maniS02E10,+1,"The episode references the death of an 'Ethiopian girl' (Nazinet) from Covid, repeatedly specifying her ethnicity and mentioning the Ethiopian community. The narrative explores the protagonist's guilt and psychological distress related to her death, and characters discuss going to the Ethiopian community for information. However, there are no explicit discussions of racism, prejudice, or systemic inequality. The girl's ethnicity is made visible and relevant, and her status as an outsider is implied, but the episode does not critically engage with racial dynamics or analyze broader social implications. The presence of race is acknowledged and shapes the narrative, but it is not deeply explored or problematized.","I did not assign a score of 0 because the episode does not merely leave racial dynamics implicit or ambiguous; it explicitly references the Ethiopian girl's identity, her community, and the impact of her death on the protagonist. There is clear acknowledgment that race and ethnicity are relevant to the story, even if not deeply analyzed.","I did not assign a score of +2 because the episode does not critically engage with racism as a social problem, nor does it analyze causes, consequences, or systemic issues related to racial inequality. There is no explicit critique of bias or discrimination, and the narrative does not center the perspectives or experiences of minoritized groups. The engagement with race remains at the level of acknowledgment rather than critical analysis.",OK,"There is an explicit reference to a 'ragazza etiope' (Ethiopian girl) who died of Covid, and discussion about the protagonist's guilt and panic attacks relating to her. The show also mentions going to the Ethiopian community to ask about her, and references to her family being happy about a marriage arrangement. While the subtitles do not contain direct discussions of racism or racial prejudice, the fact that the girl's ethnicity is repeatedly specified, her being an outsider in the context, and the need to approach the Ethiopian community for information, all suggest that issues of race and possibly racial prejudice are present or at least implied. Additionally, if there is any doubt, the instruction is to answer Yes."
Doc Nelle tue mani,3,3,Doc Nelle Tue ManiS03E03,+1,"The episode contains a notable scene where Lin, a character with an East Asian name, is subjected to microaggressions and stereotypical assumptions about her ethnicity ('Sei cinese o sei giapponese?', 'Sei stupido come sembri o fai finta?'). These remarks are presented as inappropriate and are immediately challenged by Lin herself ('Basta!'), with the narrative moving on without validating the discriminatory behavior. However, the episode does not deeply explore the implications of these racialized comments, nor does it offer a sustained critique or analysis of racism as a systemic issue. The rest of the episode focuses primarily on gender dynamics and professional struggles, with no further engagement with race or racism. Thus, the episode recognizes the presence of racial dynamics and bias, but does not critically engage with them.",I did not assign a 0 because the episode does not merely present racial dynamics without positioning; it includes a clear instance of racial bias that is recognized and briefly challenged within the narrative. The microaggression is not left entirely ambiguous or unaddressed.,"I did not assign a +2 because the episode does not explicitly address racism as a social problem, nor does it examine causes, consequences, or contradictions related to racial discrimination. There is no narrative accountability, sustained critique, or invitation to reflect on broader racial issues. The engagement remains at the level of individual interaction rather than structural analysis.",OK,"There is an implicit reference to racial prejudice in the exchange with Lin, a character with an East Asian name. She is asked, 'Sei cinese o sei giapponese?' ('Are you Chinese or Japanese?') and 'Sei stupido come sembri o fai finta?'

Doc Nelle tue mani,3,9,Doc Nelle Tue ManiS03E09,0,"The episode contains a single, brief exchange that references a racial stereotype ('Ti vuoi trasferire qui tipo operaia di una fabbrica cinese?'), which is immediately acknowledged as a stereotype and reciprocated with another stereotype about wealth. The characters themselves call out the use of stereotypes ('Stereotipi uno pari'), signaling some self-awareness. However, this is the only moment in the episode where race or racism is even implicitly referenced. The rest of the episode does not engage with racial themes, either in terms of character arcs, narrative conflict, or broader social commentary.

Stereotipi due pari.'). This line acknowledges a common racial stereotype in a joking, reciprocal manner, but the topic of racism is not further developed, thematized, or critically engaged with elsewhere in the episode. The rest of the narrative focuses on labor, technology, medical diagnostics, and interpersonal relationships, without any significant engagement with race or racism. Thus, the theme is present implicitly and briefly, but the episode does not take a clear position or provide interpretative framing regarding racism.","I did not assign -1 because the episode does not systematically minimize or omit racial issues that would plausibly be relevant in its context; rather, race is almost entirely absent except for one brief, joking reference. There is no evidence of reframing or downplaying racial dynamics, nor is there a pattern of treating diversity as merely cosmetic.","I did not assign +1 because, aside from the single stereotype joke, there is no recognition, acknowledgment, or exploration of racial dynamics, bias, or discrimination.

Doc Nelle tue mani,3,11,Doc Nelle Tue ManiS03E11,+1,"The episode contains a brief but clear instance of racial stereotyping and microaggression when a character refers to Lin Wang as 'la cinesina' ('the little Chinese girl'), followed by the defensive phrase 'Non ho niente contro i cinesi' ('I have nothing against the Chinese'). This exchange acknowledges the presence of racialized attitudes and hints at everyday bias, but the narrative does not deeply explore or critique these dynamics. Lin herself is not shown to react to the comment, and the moment is not thematized or problematized further. The rest of the episode does not engage with race or racism in any explicit or analytical way. Thus, the dominant stance is one of recognition: the episode acknowledges racial dynamics exist, but does not critically engage or analyze them.","I did not assign a 0 because the episode does not leave the racial content entirely ambiguous or implicit; the microaggression is recognizable and the character's defensiveness signals some awareness of racial bias. Nor is it minimized or reframed as something else (-1), as the moment is presented as a casual, everyday occurrence, not explained away or ignored.

Doc Nelle tue mani,3,13,Doc Nelle Tue ManiS03E13,+1,"The episode recognizes and represents racial and cultural dynamics, particularly through the storyline of Lin and Yu, sisters from a Chinese family in Italy. The narrative addresses issues such as parental disapproval of cross-cultural relationships, pressure to conform to family and cultural expectations, and the challenges faced by children of immigrants.

L allieva,1,6,L allievaS01E06,+2,"The episode critically engages with racial inequality by centering the murder of a Somali activist in Italy, explicitly referencing her identity as a Black woman, her activism, and the dangers she faces as a minority.

The episode acknowledges both explicit and implicit racial dynamics, such as prejudice, stereotyping (e.g., assumptions about prostitution), and the challenges faced by minoritized individuals. Characters discuss ethnic identity (Mursi, Somali), cultural practices, and the impact of activism. The narrative supports the victim's perspective, problematizes her treatment, and invites reflection on broader racial and institutional issues, though it stops short of offering a sustained, transformative analysis or centering marginalized voices as fully authoritative.","A +1 would be insufficient because the episode does more than merely acknowledge racial dynamics or hint at bias; it explicitly addresses racism, the risks faced by activists, and the structural context (arms trade, European involvement, prejudice against immigrants). The narrative holds certain characters accountable and encourages reflection on systemic issues, moving beyond surface-level recognition.","A +3 is not warranted because, while the episode is explicit and critical in its engagement, it does not provide a sustained analytical or transformative framing of race and racism.

The episode explores the impact of these dynamics on Valerio's mental health and relationships, and also depicts the struggle of his lover, Domenico, who is unable to openly acknowledge their relationship due to fear of societal judgment. The narrative voice and supporting characters show empathy and understanding toward Valerio, and the episode invites viewers to reflect on the causes and consequences of discrimination.

There are explicit references to racism and prejudice, such as the use of a racial slur ('Un negro volevi dire?'), microaggressions ('Africa'), and the depiction of migrant labor exploitation, fear of authorities, and lack of documentation. The narrative does not simply present these issues as background or incidental; it foregrounds the structural and systemic barriers faced by characters like Rosaria (a Latin American caregiver) and Mamadou (a Senegalese worker), including their precarious legal status, economic vulnerability, and exposure to discrimination. The episode also includes moments where characters challenge bias (e.g., confronting derogatory language, advocating for fair treatment, and supporting migrant characters' rights to care and dignity). The narrative voice and character interactions invite viewers to reflect on how race and migration shape access, power, and perception, and it incorporates institutional and historical contexts (e.g., references to permits, labor exploitation, and the impact of migration on family life). While the episode is not didactic or wholly centered on anti-racist transformation, its dominant stance is one of critical engagement with racial inequality.","A lower score (such as +1) would be appropriate if the episode merely acknowledged racial dynamics or depicted bias without deeper exploration. However, this episode goes further: it not only recognizes the presence of racism and systemic barriers but also examines their causes and consequences, holds characters accountable for prejudice, and gives narrative space to the perspectives and struggles of affected individuals. The engagement is more than surface-level or incidental.","A higher score (+3) would require the episode to offer a sustained, explicit, and transformative analysis of race and racism, centering marginalized voices as authoritative, and actively promoting pathways to equity or reconciliation. While this episode is critically engaged and empathetic, it does not fully center the voices of marginalized characters as narrative authorities, nor does it provide an in-depth analytical or transformative framework for understanding or overcoming racism. The focus remains primarily on the challenges and responses within the existing system, rather than on broader social transformation.",OK,"There are multiple explicit and implicit references to racism, racial prejudice, and discrimination in these subtitles. For example, there is a scene where a character is referred to with the racial slur 'negro' in a derogatory context ('Un negro volevi dire?'), and there are discussions about migrant workers, their exploitation, and difficulties with permits and integration (e.g., references to 'permesso di soggiorno', 'badante', and characters from Senegal and Venezuela). There are also microaggressions and stereotypes, such as calling someone 'Africa' in a dismissive way and questioning the work and status of migrant characters. The narrative includes systemic inequalities (migrant labor, lack of documentation, fear of authorities) and direct experiences of racial bias and prejudice."
Terapia d urgenza,1,12,Terapia d urgenzaS01E12,-1,"The episode contains several references to race and ethnicity, including a racial slur ('Cercare l'acqua per i negretti') and multiple mentions of characters with Mexican or African connections. However, these references are either presented in a casual, offhand, or stereotypical manner and are not critically engaged by the narrative or other characters. The storyline involving a couple returning from Uganda and the subsequent outbreak of a disease (peste bubonica) subtly invokes stereotypes about Africa and contagion, but these associations are not interrogated or problematized. The episode does not overtly endorse racism or normalize racial inequality as natural, but it tends to minimize or sideline the racial dimensions of the situations it depicts, treating them as incidental or as background rather than as meaningful or problematic. There is little to no acknowledgment of structural or systemic racial issues, and moments that could invite reflection on prejudice or bias are left unaddressed.","I did not assign -2 because, while there are stereotypical or problematic references (e.g., the slur and disease associations), the episode does not portray racialized dynamics as entirely ordinary or unproblematic, nor does it present discriminatory language or attitudes as fully normalized or accepted by the narrative. The problematic elements are present but not so pervasive or uncritically embedded as to suggest normalization of racial inequality throughout the episode.","I did not assign 0 because the episode does not merely include implicit racial dynamics without clear positioning; it actively minimizes or reframes racial issues when they arise, such as treating the slur as a joke and not addressing the implications of associating Africa with disease. There is a consistent pattern of omission or minimization rather than simple ambivalence or lack of positioning.",OK,"There are both explicit and implicit references to race and potential racial prejudice. Explicitly, the phrase 'Cercare l'acqua per i negretti' ('Looking for water for the little negroes') is used, which is a racial slur and stereotype about Africans, and is followed by a dismissive tone. There are also references to a child with a Mexican mother and a character returning from Mexico, which could imply issues of ethnicity or prejudice, though not overtly discriminatory in context. Additionally, the storyline involving a couple returning from Uganda and the mention of diseases 'arriving from Africa' could implicitly invoke stereotypes or prejudices about Africans and disease, especially given the historical context of associating Africa with contagion. These elements together indicate the presence of racial references and possible prejudice."
Terapia d urgenza,1,16,Terapia d urgenzaS01E16,+1,"The episode features multiple explicit and implicit references to racism, prejudice, and discrimination, particularly against Black and immigrant characters (e.g., use of the slur 'negro', suspicion of a Black man with a 'cool bag' from Burundi, associating him with a bomb, and a woman expressing fear of contracting HIV from an 'arabo e negro' man). These attitudes are voiced by several characters and are depicted as part of the everyday environment. However, the narrative does not endorse these views; instead, it provides some narrative pushback: other characters challenge or correct the racist statements (e.g., a nurse asks a woman to apologize to the Black man, and a doctor rebuffs the idea that all immigrants are diseased). The episode acknowledges the presence of racism and bias, and there are moments of empathy and attempts to humanize the immigrant character Omar. Yet, the engagement remains mostly at the level of recognition and surface correction, without a sustained or deep critique of systemic racism or a transformative narrative arc. The dominant stance is thus recognition of racial dynamics, with some acknowledgment and limited challenge, but not a thorough critical engagement.","I did not assign a 0 because the episode does not remain ambivalent or neutral: it clearly acknowledges the presence of racism and racial prejudice, and some characters explicitly challenge or correct such attitudes. The theme is not merely implicit or left to interpretation; it is actively present and addressed, albeit not deeply.","I did not assign a +2 because, while the episode recognizes and occasionally challenges racist attitudes, it does not offer a sustained or explicit critique of racism as a systemic or institutional problem. There is little exploration of structural causes or consequences, and the narrative does not center the voices or experiences of marginalized characters in a way that would constitute critical engagement. The episode stops short of inviting deeper reflection or providing multiple perspectives on racial issues.",OK,"There are multiple explicit and implicit references to racism, racial prejudice, and discrimination in these subtitles. For example, the use of the racial slur 'negro' and derogatory comments about a person from Burundi with a 'cool bag' in the metro, associating him with a bomb, and questioning why he can afford something an Italian cannot. There are also scenes where a woman expresses fear of having contracted HIV from an 'arabo e negro' (Arab and Black) man, implying that he is more likely to be diseased, and complains about immigrants being treated in hospitals despite not paying taxes. Additionally, there are discussions about 'extracomunitari' (non-EU immigrants) needing to adapt to Italian rules, and the difficulties they face in finding work, with some characters expressing resentment or making generalizations about immigrants. These examples clearly indicate the presence of racism, prejudice, and discrimination based on race or ethnicity."
