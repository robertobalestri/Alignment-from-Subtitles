Braccialetti Rossi,2,2,Braccialetti RossiS02E02,Yes,"There are implicit references to racial prejudice and stereotyping. In one scene, a character named Chicco is assumed to be Chinese, and other characters make jokes about his name and background, conflating 'Filippino' with 'Chinese' and making stereotypical comments about Asian names and martial arts ('Chin-Chan-Pai, Cheung-Ful, Cheung-Cherin...'). The character has to correct them, saying he is Filipino, not Chinese, but the others dismiss the distinction ('Filippino-cinese sempre asiatico sei'). This exchange relies on racial and ethnic stereotypes and demonstrates microaggressions and ignorance about Asian identities, which are forms of racial prejudice."

Braccialetti Rossi,2,5,Braccialetti RossiS02E05,Yes,"There is an implicit reference to race and possible racial stereotyping in the conversation about 'il ragazzo filippino, tutto cicciottello. Con quel faccione sembra Kung Fu Panda.' This description of a Filipino boy using physical stereotypes and comparing him to a cartoon character with Asian features suggests the presence of racial stereotyping and potentially racial prejudice. While the rest of the episode does not contain explicit discussions of racism or racial discrimination, this instance is enough to warrant a 'Yes' answer."

Crimini bianchi,1,7,Crimini bianchiS01E07,Yes,"There are explicit references to racism and racial prejudice in the subtitles. For example, a character refers to 'le nigeriane che dalla mattina alla sera ti rompono i coglioni per un po' di cortisone... per sbiancarsi la pelle' and makes derogatory comments about Albanians. There is also discussion about undocumented immigrants not being registered as patients, and the hardships faced by foreign workers like Manuela and her daughter Alicia. These elements indicate both explicit and implicit racial prejudice and systemic discrimination."
Crimini bianchi,1,8,Crimini bianchiS01E08,No,
Crimini bianchi,1,9,Crimini bianchiS01E09,Yes,"There are both explicit and implicit references to racism and racial prejudice. Explicitly, there are discussions about the Chinese community not wanting to 'mischiarsi con noi' (mix with us), and the difficulties Tuia faces as a member of the Chinese community in Italy, including her reluctance to seek medical help and the violence she experiences from her own family to 'save face' in the community. There are also comments about living 'da stranieri' (as foreigners) in Italy, and the episode explores the challenges and microaggressions faced by immigrants and ethnic minorities. The mention of 'discriminazioni razziali' (racial discrimination) in a joking context further suggests the presence of the theme."

Cuori,1,12,CuoriS01E12,Yes,"There is an implicit reference to racial or ethnic prejudice in the following exchange: 'Tu non vali meno di nessuno dei tuoi colleghi, nonostante tutto.' 'Nonostante cosa? Le mie origini, eh?' This suggests that the character feels or is made to feel that their background or origins (potentially ethnic or racial) are a factor in how they are perceived or treated, which implies the presence of prejudice or discrimination based on origin, which can include race or ethnicity."

Cuori,2,12,CuoriS02E12,Yes,"There is an implicit reference to race and possible racial prejudice in the line: 'Oddio, ma se era nera lo sa sta cosa. Anche lei sarà tutta affezionata a quella bambina.' This suggests the child in question is Black ('nera'), and the way it is mentioned in the context of concern or surprise could imply underlying assumptions or biases about race. While there are no explicit acts of racism or discrimination described, the mention of the child's race in a context where it is otherwise irrelevant suggests an implicit reference to racial difference, which could be tied to prejudice or stereotyping."

Doc Nelle tue mani,1,8,Doc Nelle tue maniS01E08,Yes,"There are several implicit and explicit references to racism, racial prejudice, and discrimination. For example, the patient Nureddin is noted as being originally from Libya, and there is discussion about diseases more common in people from 'Africa mediterranea.' There is also a significant storyline involving a character who was a victim of human trafficking and torture in Libya, which includes references to the mistreatment of migrants and their families. Additionally, there are subtle references to assumptions about ethnicity and background (e.g., 'Tu sei nato qui! Tu non sei niente.' and the discussion of abbronzatura/skin color as a clue to someone's origins). These elements together suggest the presence of racial prejudice, discrimination, and the consequences of systemic inequalities."

Doc Nelle tue mani,2,10,Doc Nelle tue maniS02E10,Yes,"There is an explicit reference to a 'ragazza etiope' (Ethiopian girl) who died of Covid, and discussion about the protagonist's guilt and panic attacks relating to her. The show also mentions going to the Ethiopian community to ask about her, and references to her family being happy about a marriage arrangement. While the subtitles do not contain direct discussions of racism or racial prejudice, the fact that the girl's ethnicity is repeatedly specified, her being an outsider in the context, and the need to approach the Ethiopian community for information, all suggest that issues of race and possibly racial prejudice are present or at least implied. Additionally, if there is any doubt, the instruction is to answer Yes."

Doc Nelle tue mani,3,3,Doc Nelle Tue ManiS03E03,Yes,"There is an implicit reference to racial prejudice in the exchange with Lin, a character with an East Asian name. She is asked, 'Sei cinese o sei giapponese?' ('Are you Chinese or Japanese?') and 'Sei stupido come sembri o fai finta?' ('Are you as stupid as you seem or are you pretending?'), which are microaggressions and stereotypical assumptions based on her ethnicity. This suggests the presence of racial prejudice, even if not the main focus of the episode."

Doc Nelle tue mani,3,8,Doc Nelle Tue ManiS03E08,No,
Doc Nelle tue mani,3,9,Doc Nelle Tue ManiS03E09,Yes,"There is an implicit reference to racial stereotyping and microaggressions in the exchange: 'Ti vuoi trasferire qui tipo operaia di una fabbrica cinese ? - No, chiedo al papi gli ""sghei"" per comprare tutta la baracca. - Scusa. Stereotipi uno pari.' This dialogue references a stereotype about Chinese people working in factories, which is acknowledged as a stereotype by the characters themselves. This constitutes an implicit mention of racial prejudice."
Doc Nelle tue mani,3,10,Doc Nelle Tue ManiS03E10,Yes,"There is an implicit reference to racial stereotypes in the following exchange: 'Io pensavo che i cinesi si somigliassero tutti. Stereotipi due pari.' This line acknowledges and jokes about a common racial stereotype regarding people of Chinese descent. Even though it is presented in a somewhat self-aware and reciprocal manner, it still constitutes an implicit mention of racial prejudice."
Doc Nelle tue mani,3,11,Doc Nelle Tue ManiS03E11,Yes,"There is an implicit reference to racial prejudice when a character refers to another as 'la cinesina' ('the little Chinese girl'), which is a diminutive and potentially derogatory way to refer to someone of Chinese descent. The same character then says, 'Non ho niente contro i cinesi' ('I have nothing against the Chinese'), which is often a phrase used to preface or excuse prejudiced attitudes. These lines suggest the presence of racial stereotyping and microaggressions."
Doc Nelle tue mani,3,12,Doc Nelle Tue ManiS03E12,No,
Doc Nelle tue mani,3,13,Doc Nelle Tue ManiS03E13,Yes,"The episode includes implicit references to racial prejudice and cultural expectations. The storyline involving Lin and Yu, who are from a Chinese family in Italy, highlights issues such as the father's disapproval of Yu's relationship with a non-Chinese boyfriend and the pressure on Lin to fulfill family expectations. There are discussions about hiding relationships due to cultural/familial expectations, and the difficulties of being accepted for choices that diverge from traditional norms. While there are no explicit racial slurs or overt acts of racism, the narrative clearly addresses themes of cultural bias, family pressure based on ethnicity, and the challenges faced by children of immigrants, which are forms of racial or ethnic prejudice."

L allieva,1,6,L allievaS01E06,Yes,"The episode explicitly references race and ethnicity multiple times. The victim is described as a 'donna somala' (Somali woman) and 'razza nera' (Black race), and there are discussions of African ethnic groups (Mursi), cultural practices (tribal scars), and the experiences of African immigrants and activists. The plot centers on the murder of a Somali activist in Italy, with references to her being a minority, her activism against warlords, and her efforts to expose European companies' involvement in arms trafficking in Africa. There are also implicit references to prejudice and potential bias, such as the suggestion that the protagonist may face prejudice due to her associations, and the description of the victim as a prostitute, which can intersect with racialized stereotypes. The episode thus contains both explicit and implicit references to race, ethnicity, and potential racial prejudice or discrimination."

L allieva,1,8,L allievaS01E08,No,
L allieva,1,9,L allievaS01E09,Yes,"There are implicit references to racial or ethnic identity, particularly in the interactions involving Toshiro and Yukino, who are Japanese. For example, there is a comment about 'i giapponesi hanno un rapporto molto intimo', which, while not overtly negative, generalizes about Japanese people and could be considered a stereotype. Additionally, Toshiro is referred to as 'il cugino strano', which, in context, could be interpreted as othering based on his ethnicity. There are also moments where language barriers are highlighted ('Davvero? Non parli italiano? In inglese, bene.'), which may imply a sense of exclusion. While there are no explicit discussions of racism or racial discrimination, these subtle references and stereotypes suggest the presence of implicit racial prejudice."
L allieva,1,10,L allievaS01E10,No,
L allieva,1,11,L allievaS01E11,Yes,"While the episode does not explicitly discuss racism or racial prejudice, it contains multiple explicit and implicit references to prejudice and discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation, particularly in the storyline of Valerio, a transgender character. Valerio faces rejection, attempts to be expelled from his home by his father and brother, is described as being disdained and mocked by neighbors, and is the target of violent messages on social media. There are also references to the shame and fear experienced by Valerio's lover, and the impact of societal prejudice on their relationship. These elements constitute clear depictions of prejudice and discrimination based on identity, which, by the user's instruction, should be treated as relevant to the question."
L allieva,2,1,L allievaS02E01,Yes,"There are several references that touch on race and ethnicity. Explicitly, during the forensic analysis, the phrase 'madre di razza negroide' is used, which is an outdated and potentially offensive term for describing someone of African descent. The discussion of the victim being of mixed race ('padre europeo e madre egiziana o etiope') also brings up racial identity. Additionally, there are implicit references to nationality and ethnicity, such as the grandmother's comments about all the girlfriends being 'straniere' (foreigners) and not being able to have a conversation with them, which hints at prejudice or bias toward foreigners. There are also comments about physical appearance tied to nationality (e.g., 'bionda, una giraffona, bella però, eh?'). While there are no overt acts of racial discrimination or slurs, the language and some attitudes suggest the presence of racial and ethnic bias."

L allieva,2,5,L allievaS02E05,No,
L allieva,2,6,L allievaS02E06,Yes,"There are both explicit and implicit references to racism and racial prejudice in the episode. The victim, Hamid Najim, is described as a young Libyan man and a Muslim. There are discussions about his status as an 'extracomunitario' (foreigner), and it is mentioned that sometimes foreign detainees have undiagnosed health issues. The investigation reveals that Hamid was falsely accused and imprisoned, and his girlfriend claims that nobody believed her when she said he was innocent, suggesting systemic bias. The murderer, Fulvio Loi, is described as having killed Hamid due to 'angherie, disprezzo, agli insulti' (abuse, contempt, insults) that he directed at Hamid, and the narration explicitly calls Loi a 'pazzo razzista' (crazy racist). There is also a line in Neapolitan dialect: 'Sti marrucchini tenono tutto quanto la faccio qua' (These Moroccans do everything here), which is a prejudiced, stereotypical comment. The episode clearly deals with issues of racial prejudice, discrimination, and bias, both at the individual and systemic level."
L allieva,2,7,L allievaS02E07,No,
L allieva,2,8,L allievaS02E08,Yes,"There are several implicit references to racial prejudice and stereotyping in the subtitles. The suspects of the crime are repeatedly referred to as 'cittadini dell'est' (Eastern European citizens) and 'di origine rom' (of Romani origin), and there is a discussion about cultural stereotypes (e.g., 'loro non portano neanche l'argento perché ossidando si diventa nero e per la loro cultura porta sfortuna'). The identification of suspects based on their ethnicity and the mention of their cultural practices suggest racial profiling and bias. Additionally, the episode touches on systemic issues, such as people 'like us' having to work harder because they lack important connections, which can be read as a reference to social inequalities that often intersect with race and ethnicity."
L allieva,2,9,L allievaS02E09,Yes,"The episode includes multiple references to racial prejudice and intolerance. There is a direct mention of a 'cena e vento contro l'intoleranza razziale' (dinner/event against racial intolerance), indicating the topic is addressed explicitly. Additionally, the episode discusses a character named Matthew who is described as helping marginalized people, and there are implications that he was targeted and ultimately killed because he was helping mendicants (who are often from marginalized or minority groups), and this angered their 'sfruttatori' (exploiters). The narrative also references 'giustizieri' (vigilantes) and 'ronde del servizio d'ordine cittadino' (citizen patrols), which in Italian context often have connotations of targeting immigrants or minorities. The episode thus explicitly and implicitly addresses issues of racial prejudice, discrimination, and intolerance."
L allieva,2,10,L allievaS02E10,Yes,"There are implicit references to racism and systemic issues related to race and ethnicity. Specifically, the subplot involving Nur, a child from Aleppo whose father is a Syrian asylum seeker in Italy, touches on the experiences of refugees and asylum seekers—groups often subject to racial and ethnic prejudice, discrimination, and systemic barriers. The discussion of the father's status as a 'richiedente asilo' (asylum seeker), the involvement of centers of 'accoglienza' (reception centers), and the need for help from authorities to locate him allude to the broader context of migration, integration, and the challenges faced by people of certain ethnic backgrounds in Italy. While there are no explicit mentions of racial slurs or overt acts of racism, the inclusion of these themes implies the presence of racial and ethnic issues."

L allieva,3,1,L allievaS03E01,Yes,"There are implicit references to abuse of power and sexual abuse by a male choreographer (Marchelier) towards his young female ballet students, but there are no explicit or implicit references to racism, racial discrimination, or racial prejudice in the subtitles. However, the instructions say to answer Yes if there is any doubt. There is a brief mention of a 'giro del mondo, prima tappa Africa' (world tour, first stop Africa), but this is not presented in a prejudiced or stereotyped way. There is also a line where a character refers to 'riti tribali' (tribal rites) in a metaphorical context about marriage, which could be considered as an implicit use of a racialized stereotype, albeit not directed at any character or group. Given the instruction to answer Yes if there is any doubt, the use of 'riti tribali' as a metaphor could be interpreted as an implicit reference to racial or ethnic stereotypes."
L allieva,3,2,L allievaS03E02,No,
L allieva,3,3,L allievaS03E03,Yes,"There are several references that suggest the presence of racism or racial prejudice in the episode. Most notably, the character Rocita is called 'una scimmia' (a monkey), which, depending on context, can be a racial slur or a dehumanizing term, especially if directed at a person of color or someone from a marginalized group. Additionally, the investigation into Aiko Okusada's murder involves her being a Japanese woman in Italy, and there is explicit mention that Mattucci, a suspect, 'non fa altro che scrivere e inveire contro i giapponesi' (does nothing but write and rant against the Japanese) on social media, indicating explicit racial prejudice. The episode also references the Bororo indigenous people in Brazil, and while these references are not overtly prejudiced, the use of terms like 'primitivo' (primitive) and the exoticization of their customs may imply subtle stereotypes or microaggressions. Overall, both explicit and implicit references to racial prejudice and stereotypes are present."

L allieva,3,9,L allievaS03E09,Yes,"There is an explicit reference to race and ethnicity in the scene where a new identification protocol is demonstrated: 'Maschio africano. Sì. Precisamente della Nigeria. Più precisamente ancora della zona di Lagos. Ma ha sostato diverso tempo in Libia. Il software lo riconosce dal tipo di sabbia sotto le unghie.' This scene involves identifying an unidentified victim as an African male from Nigeria, with further details about his migration route. The context—using forensic technology to identify likely migrants—implicitly references issues of migration, ethnicity, and potentially the systemic challenges faced by African migrants in Europe. While there are no overt acts of racism or racial prejudice depicted in the subtitles, the presence of a Nigerian migrant victim and the discussion of his background can be seen as an implicit reference to broader issues of race, ethnicity, and possibly the marginalization or vulnerability of such individuals."

La dottoressa Gio,1,1,La dottoressa GioS01E01,Yes,"There are implicit references to racial prejudice and microaggressions. For example, when a new nurse of color is introduced, a character says, 'Forse è perché non vi aspettavate un'infermiera di colore.' ('Maybe it's because you didn't expect a nurse of color.') Another character refers to her as 'bel cioccolatino' ('nice little chocolate'), which is a racially charged comment. Additionally, there are comments about 'extracomunitari che manco ce l'hanno' (referring to non-EU immigrants lacking health cards), which implies systemic bias and possible discrimination. These elements suggest the presence of racial prejudice and microaggressions, even if not the main focus of the episode."
La dottoressa Gio,1,2,La dottoressa GioS01E02,Yes,"There are several explicit and implicit references to racism and racial prejudice in the subtitles. For example, a character jokes about the possibility of a child being born 'cinese' (Chinese) or 'nero come me, che è anche peggio' (black like me, which is even worse), which is an explicit reference to racial prejudice and negative stereotypes about black people. Later, during a dance class, a character says 'lo sanno tutti che voi neri avete il ritmo nel sangue' (everyone knows you blacks have rhythm in your blood), which is a racial stereotype. These references, both in dialogue and in the attitudes of the characters, indicate the presence of racism and racial prejudice in the episode."
La dottoressa Gio,1,3,La dottoressa GioS01E03,Yes,"There are multiple explicit and implicit references to racism, racial discrimination, and prejudice throughout the episode. The use of terms like 'zingaro', 'zingarello', 'zingarella', and 'razza' (race), as well as discussions about 'tribù', and negative stereotypes about Roma people (e.g., 'sono gente povera', 'vivono, viaggiano per le fiere', 'sono una razza a parte'), indicate both societal and interpersonal prejudice. Characters experience and discuss exclusion, threats, and violence based on ethnicity (e.g., 'suo padre cacciato me con pietre', 'sono venuto di nascosto. Mio padre non voleva che stavo con una zingara e ha pure dato dei soldi suoi per non farmela più incontrare'). There are also microaggressions and derogatory remarks from other characters (e.g., 'gentaglia', 'ladri', 'quella zoccoletta', 'non porterà mai un nome da zingaro'). The episode depicts systemic and interpersonal discrimination, including the challenges faced by Roma people in accessing services and being accepted by the majority population."
La dottoressa Gio,1,4,La dottoressa GioS01E04,Yes,"There is an explicit reference to racism and racial prejudice in the scene where a patient says 'Non mi faccio toccare da una negra' ('I don't let a black woman touch me'), and further states, 'a me la gente di colore mi ha sempre fatto impressione' ('people of color have always made an impression on me'). This is a clear example of racial prejudice and discrimination. Additionally, there is a later conversation where a character worries if her partner will want a child 'da me', and when questioned, she says 'Martina, non dirmi che sei diventata razzista pure tu, eh?', which, while not an explicit act of racism, shows awareness and concern about racial issues. These scenes directly address and imply the presence of racism and racial prejudice."
La dottoressa Gio,1,5,La dottoressa GioS01E05,Yes,"There are multiple explicit and implicit references to racism, racial prejudice, and discrimination throughout the subtitles. Examples include: (1) the use of the racial slur 'negra' by a character referring to herself, (2) a conversation questioning whether 'extracomunitari' (foreigners, often used in Italy to refer to non-EU immigrants) should be allowed to work as nurses, with complaints about job competition and language, (3) microaggressions and stereotypical comments about skin color and language skills, (4) a landlord's hesitation about renting to a Black woman, (5) the backstory of Martina's mother being ashamed of having a Black daughter and abandoning her, (6) explicit discussion of the difficulties faced by Martina as a mixed-race child, and (7) the mother's monologue about the social stigma of having a child with a Black man and being the only white woman in Africa. These elements clearly indicate the presence of racism, racial prejudice, and discrimination as both explicit and implicit themes in the episode."

Notably, there is a scene where a woman and her husband, described as 'araba' (Arab), request to be seen by a female doctor due to cultural reasons. The attending male doctor refuses, stating 'qui siamo in Italia, per cui sono loro che si devono adeguare alla nostra,' which dismisses their cultural needs and implies a lack of accommodation for ethnic or cultural differences. Additionally, there are other minor references to characters' ethnic backgrounds (e.g., a doctor from Hanoi, a 'cinesino'), and some dialogue that could be interpreted as microaggressions or cultural insensitivity. While there are no explicit mentions of racism or racial slurs, the episode does contain situations where ethnic or cultural differences are met with prejudice or lack of understanding."

Notably, there is a scene where a character says 'prima che arrivi a alzare la negra', which is a racial slur in Italian. This is an explicit use of a racial epithet, indicating the presence of racism or racial prejudice in the episode. Additionally, there are scenes involving a patient who is a detained, HIV-positive woman, and some staff express discomfort and make potentially prejudiced remarks about her condition, which may also reflect implicit bias or discrimination."

The most direct example is when a baby is born with darker skin, and a character says, 'mio fratello è niguru ma questo non può essere figlio suo eh così occhio e croce mi sa di no,' and later, 'Ma questo non è il mio cugino, è tutto nero.' These comments reference the baby's skin color and imply suspicion and othering based on race. Additionally, the story of Johnny, 'salvato da quelli arrivati coi barconi,' references African migrants, and the term 'niguru' is a racialized term in Italian. These elements, along with the reactions of the family, indicate both explicit and implicit racial prejudice."

For example, the character Nadim, who is implied to be of non-Italian origin, is involved in a storyline about a secret relationship and an unplanned pregnancy with an Italian girl, Aurora. The secrecy, the difficulties they face, and the reactions of adults (such as the disbelief that Aurora could have a relationship with someone outside her social circle) can be read as touching on themes of prejudice or bias related to ethnicity or immigration status. Additionally, the subplot involving Collia, a Russian child whose adoption is revoked, includes the threat of being sent back to a Russian orphanage, which may imply systemic inequalities or challenges faced by foreign-born children in the Italian system.

There is also a moment where someone asks if Amal has a residence permit, implying suspicion towards foreigners. These exchanges reflect xenophobia and racialized prejudice against immigrants or people perceived as outsiders.

(2) There are discussions about immigrants (e.g., Erion from Albania, a Senegalese patient) and their difficulties, including working illegally, fear of authorities, and being at risk of being sent back to their country. (3) There are microaggressions and stereotypical assumptions about foreigners, such as the comment about someone from Senegal possibly not understanding the danger of a chemical because 'magari lo scambia per la bandiera dei pirati.' (4) The episode also discusses systemic issues, such as the threat of losing a work permit or being reported to the police if the immigrant does not cooperate, and the general suspicion and extra scrutiny towards non-Italian characters.

There is also a discussion about whether the cooperatives are 'oneste' or 'disoneste' (honest or dishonest), and a character points out that some workers are afraid to ask for help or sick leave for fear of being fired and losing their right to stay.

There are also depictions of systemic barriers and challenges faced by these children and their families in accessing care, as well as moments where staff question or resist helping them because they are not Italian. These elements together suggest the presence of racial and cultural prejudice, both implicit and explicit."
Medicina generale,1,13,Medicina generaleS01E13,Yes,"The episode contains several implicit references to issues of race, ethnicity, and systemic inequality. The storyline involves Italian doctors traveling to Mumbai, India, where they interact with local people and street children. There are discussions about poverty, being considered a 'third world country,' and the challenges faced by Indian children (e.g., lack of access to healthcare, child labor, exploitation). There's also a scene where an Indian character expresses resentment about how their country is perceived and treated by outsiders, mentioning the desire for respect and being tired of being seen as 'third world.' Additionally, there are cultural microaggressions and stereotypes, such as comments about food, hygiene, and the way of life in India. The plot involving the street child being 'owned' or exploited by an adult further highlights systemic inequalities often tied to race and ethnicity.

This highlights issues related to immigration, legal status, and the precarious situation of foreigners, which are often tied to racial or ethnic discrimination.

('In black people, sarcoidosis is more acute and severe with more frequent extra-thoracic involvement at onset.') While these are medical observations, the explicit mention of race as a negative prognostic factor and the focus on racial differences in disease presentation bring up the topic of race and could be seen as touching on systemic inequalities or biases in medicine.

This suggests a focus on a specific ethnic group (immigrant children) for a medical screening, which may imply systemic assumptions or biases about race/ethnicity and disease. Additionally, there is a question to a patient about whether he has been 'a lungo fuori dall'Italia? In Europa, dell'Est, Oriente, Africa?' in the context of a suspected disease, which can reflect implicit bias or stereotype associating certain illnesses with foreign or non-Italian populations.

There are also dismissive and dehumanizing comments about him ('un bel sedativo per il barbone?', 'Ma che puzza, ma che è, un tarantolato?'), and his treatment by both staff and others is notably different and less compassionate, which suggests prejudice based on his ethnicity and social status. Additionally, there is a discussion about not being 'classista' (classist), which, while not explicitly racial, is often intertwined with ethnic and racial prejudice, especially regarding immigrants or marginalized groups.

More significantly, there is an extended subplot involving a 'campo nomadi' (Roma camp), where the characters discuss that 'la maggior parte delle persone a cui ci rivolgiamo non sa neanche leggere' (most of the people we target can't even read), and the medical team visits a marginalized community living in poor hygienic conditions. These scenes imply systemic discrimination and social exclusion based on ethnicity (Roma people), and the way the characters talk about and interact with this group suggests awareness of their marginalized status. The repeated mention of illiteracy and poor living conditions among the Roma, as well as the need to 'acquistare la loro fiducia' (gain/buy their trust), further implies social and racial prejudice."

The dialogue reflects systemic inequalities and prejudice, such as the suspicion that the family is neglectful, the fear of children being removed, and the marginalization of their community. The use of 'Zingarello' (a diminutive of 'Zingaro,' which can be a pejorative term for Roma people) is also an explicit indicator.

There is a conversation between two women from Eastern Europe about their experiences in Italy, with one saying 'l'Italia è il paese di tutte le possibilità. Ma si può rimanere fregati pure qua, vero?' (Italy is a land of opportunity, but you can still get screwed here), suggesting awareness of systemic difficulties faced by immigrants. The episode also discusses the challenges faced by these women, such as being alone, lacking support, and struggling with bureaucracy, which can be linked to systemic inequalities and the marginalization of ethnic minorities.
