Braccialetti Rossi,3,2,Braccialetti RossiS03E02,No,
Braccialetti Rossi,3,3,Braccialetti RossiS03E03,Yes,"The topic of pregnancy and potential pregnancy termination is implied and discussed. Chris is asked by a doctor if she is pregnant ('Non sarei mica incinta?'), and later Chris confides to Nina that she is indeed pregnant and expresses uncertainty about telling Leo, the father. There is also a discussion about whether she wants to keep the baby ('Ma tu lo vuoi questo bambino?'), which suggests consideration of options regarding the pregnancy. While abortion is not mentioned explicitly, the context of discussing whether to keep the baby and the associated fears and decisions strongly imply that pregnancy termination is a possible topic under consideration."
Braccialetti Rossi,3,4,Braccialetti RossiS03E04,Yes,"The topic of pregnancy and the possibility of not carrying a pregnancy to term is explicitly discussed. Chris is told 'è evidente che tu non puoi portare avanti la gravidanza, no?' (it's clear you can't carry on the pregnancy, right?), and there is a conversation about whether to keep the baby or not, concerns about being able to raise the child, and parental pressure. These are clear references to the consideration of abortion or pregnancy termination."
Braccialetti Rossi,3,5,Braccialetti RossiS03E05,Yes,"The topic of pregnancy and the possibility of not having the baby is discussed multiple times. Chris is pregnant ('Adesso ci siamo solo io e te e il nostro fagiolino'), and there are conversations about whether to have the child, with lines like 'Non lo voglio questo povero bimbo con l'8%, Chris. Perché dobbiamo mettere al mondo un orfano? Che senso ha?' and 'Io lo farò nascere, che te lo voglia o no, guardami.' These exchanges imply a discussion about pregnancy options, including the possibility of termination, even if the word 'aborto' is never used explicitly."
Braccialetti Rossi,3,6,Braccialetti RossiS03E06,Yes,"There are several references to pregnancy and a baby (e.g., 'aspetti un figlio?', 'è incinta', 'il bambino', 'il fagiolino', 'il cuore di un feto', etc.), and at one point a character says 'La prego, aspettiamo un bambino', and there is concern for the health of the pregnancy after a medical emergency. There is also a conversation about whether to keep the baby ('per il bambino hai cambiato idea?'), which suggests a prior discussion about options regarding the pregnancy. This implies that the topic of abortion or pregnancy termination may have been discussed or considered, even if not explicitly shown in the subtitles. Therefore, the answer is Yes."
Braccialetti Rossi,3,7,Braccialetti RossiS03E07,Yes,"There are several references to pregnancy and a character (Cris) being pregnant. There is a conversation where Cris discusses making a 'crazy' decision, and her friend asks if she is sure and if she has thought it through, and offers to help her. There is also mention of not telling her parents. While the word 'abortion' or 'termination' is not used explicitly, the context strongly suggests that Cris is considering her options regarding her pregnancy, which could include abortion. Given the instructions to answer Yes if there is any doubt, the answer is Yes."

Crimini bianchi,1,2,Crimini bianchiS01E02,No,
Crimini bianchi,1,3,Crimini bianchiS01E03,Yes,There is an explicit reference to 'feti abortiti' (aborted fetuses) being used for organ transplants in the line: 'Nell'86 è accusato di aver trapiantato su pazienti talassemici fegati di feti abortiti.' This directly mentions abortion in the context of medical procedures.
Crimini bianchi,1,4,Crimini bianchiS01E04,Yes,"The topic of abortion is explicitly mentioned in the subtitles. There is a discussion about a woman (Ludovica Parenti) who had an abortion ('Perché non ci ha detto che sua moglie ha abortito?'), and it is revealed that she suffered medical complications due to a poorly performed procedure ('il raschiamento è stato eseguito male'). There are also references to the emotional consequences and the impact on her relationship with her husband. These are clear and explicit references to pregnancy termination."

Cuori,1,2,CuoriS01E02,No,
Cuori,1,3,CuoriS01E03,No,
Cuori,1,4,CuoriS01E04,Yes,"There are several references that imply the topic of abortion or pregnancy termination. One character says, 'Sono incinta. E il padre non ne vuole sapere. E adesso avrò questo bambino e non mi vorrà più nessuno.' This suggests an unwanted pregnancy and the emotional distress associated with it, which often leads to discussions about possible options, including abortion. Additionally, there are multiple scenes discussing the difficulties and decisions surrounding pregnancy and the future, which could implicitly reference considering pregnancy termination. Given the instructions to answer Yes if there is any doubt, the answer is Yes."
Cuori,1,5,CuoriS01E05,No,
Cuori,1,6,CuoriS01E06,No,
Cuori,1,7,CuoriS01E07,Yes,"There are several references that suggest the topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is at least implied. For example, there is a conversation where it is revealed that Luisa 'ha tentato di uccidersi mentre era incinta' (Luisa attempted suicide while pregnant), and another character says 'non potevo lasciarla da sola a Torino, abbandonata dall'uomo che l'aveva messa incinta. Soprattutto non volevo che rinunciassi all'America per colpa mia.' There are also discussions about unwanted pregnancy, fear, and difficult choices related to being pregnant and the consequences. While abortion is not mentioned explicitly, the context of unwanted pregnancy, emotional distress, and references to not wanting to be left alone while pregnant, as well as the phrase 'non volevo che rinunciassi all'America per colpa mia,' strongly suggest the topic is present or implied."

Cuori,2,3,CuoriS02E03,No,
Cuori,2,4,CuoriS02E04,Yes,"There is an explicit reference to pregnancy loss and the possibility of an intervention: 'Serenella aspettava un bambino da te? Sì. Poi che è successo? E poi è successo che fortunatamente non c'è stato bisogno di intervento perché... Lei lo ha perso spontaneamente, fortunatamente.' This exchange discusses an unwanted pregnancy, the potential for a procedure (implied to be an abortion or pregnancy termination), and a miscarriage that made the intervention unnecessary. This is an implicit and explicit reference to the topic of abortion or pregnancy termination."
Cuori,2,5,CuoriS02E05,No,
Cuori,2,6,CuoriS02E06,No,
Cuori,2,7,CuoriS02E07,No,
Cuori,2,8,CuoriS02E08,No,
Cuori,2,9,CuoriS02E09,Yes,"There is an explicit reference to a woman confronting another woman (her biological mother) about why she was not wanted or was given up, with the biological mother saying 'Tutta la tua vita dimostra che ho fatto la scelta giusta 31 anni fa.' and 'Non è vero. E poi non serve a niente.' This conversation, along with the emotional context and the time frame (31 years ago), strongly implies a past unwanted pregnancy and a decision regarding the fate of the child, which could include abortion or adoption. Given the ambiguity and the user's instruction to answer Yes in case of doubt, the topic is at least implied."
Cuori,2,10,CuoriS02E10,No,
Cuori,2,11,CuoriS02E11,Yes,"There are several lines that strongly suggest the topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is mentioned or implied. For example, the exchange: 'Ma io non volevo questo bambino. Era mio.' and 'Tu ti sei tolto un peso.' These lines suggest that a character had an unwanted pregnancy and has now 'gotten rid of a burden,' which is a common euphemism for terminating a pregnancy. The emotional context and the discussion of not wanting the baby further support this interpretation."

Doc Nelle tue mani,1,4,Doc Nelle tue maniS01E04,No,
Doc Nelle tue mani,1,5,Doc Nelle tue maniS01E05,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is explicitly mentioned in the line: 'Potrebbe essere un aborto incompleto.' (It could be an incomplete abortion.) The discussion continues with references to a possible unwanted pregnancy, a relationship with the sister's husband, and the possibility of an abortion in a 'clinica di seconda scelta' (second-rate clinic). There is also discussion about surgical removal of reproductive organs (isteroaniesectomia), which, while not an abortion, is related to reproductive health and the inability to have children. Therefore, the topic is both explicitly and implicitly present."
Doc Nelle tue mani,1,6,Doc Nelle tue maniS01E06,No,
Doc Nelle tue mani,1,7,Doc Nelle tue maniS01E07,No,
Doc Nelle tue mani,1,8,Doc Nelle tue maniS01E08,No,
Doc Nelle tue mani,1,9,Doc Nelle tue maniS01E09,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is implied in the storyline involving the novizia (novice) Cecilia. She is found to have a calcified embryo in her abdomen, the result of an undetected ectopic pregnancy that ended years earlier. The dialogue discusses how the embryo died and calcified (a pregnancy that 'si interrompe subito' and 'l'embrione senza vita si è calcificato'), and the removal of the embryo is scheduled as a surgical procedure. Additionally, there is reflection on how her life would have been different if the pregnancy had continued, further implying the theme of pregnancy loss/termination."

Doc Nelle tue mani,1,11,Doc Nelle tue maniS01E11,No,
Doc Nelle tue mani,1,12,Doc Nelle tue maniS01E12,No,
Doc Nelle tue mani,2,1,Doc Nelle tue maniS02E01,Yes,"The topic of pregnancy and its possible termination is both explicitly and implicitly referenced. Giulia reveals she is pregnant from a one-night stand with Lorenzo and discusses not wanting to 'incasinare la vita' (mess up her life or his), and Andrea directly asks, 'Tu non lo vuoi tenere?' ('You don't want to keep it?'), which is a clear reference to considering not carrying the pregnancy to term (i.e., abortion or termination). Later, after a medical emergency, a doctor says, 'Se il feto ha avuto dei danni dobbiamo rimuoverlo' ('If the fetus has suffered damage, we must remove it'), which is an explicit reference to a possible medical abortion. Thus, the topic is both mentioned and discussed."
Doc Nelle tue mani,2,2,Doc Nelle tue maniS02E02,Yes,"There is a conversation where a character says: 'La gravidanza era appena cominciata, non significava ancora niente per me.' (The pregnancy had just begun, it didn't mean anything to me yet.) This reference to a recently begun pregnancy, in the context of loss and trauma, could imply a pregnancy loss, possibly including abortion or miscarriage. Since the guidelines say to answer Yes if there is any doubt and to include implicit references, this qualifies."
Doc Nelle tue mani,2,3,Doc Nelle tue maniS02E03,Yes,"The topic of pregnancy termination is implied in the following exchange: 'Forse i parametri di Giulia sono in miglioramento. Ma il bambino... Mi dispiace. Vado a organizzare raschiamento.' The term 'raschiamento' refers to a dilation and curettage (D&C), a procedure performed after a miscarriage or for pregnancy termination. The context suggests that the pregnancy has ended and a D&C is being organized, which is an implicit reference to pregnancy termination."
Doc Nelle tue mani,2,4,Doc Nelle tue maniS02E04,No,
Doc Nelle tue mani,2,5,Doc Nelle tue maniS02E05,No,
Doc Nelle tue mani,2,6,Doc Nelle tue maniS02E06,Yes,"There is an explicit discussion about the parents of Antonio considering whether to 'portare avanti la gravidanza' (carry on the pregnancy) after learning via amniocentesis that their child would have a genetic disorder (PKU). The mother says, 'Tutti ci dicevano che era irragionevole portare avanti la gravidanza. Ma era la mia ultima occasione. Io me lo sentivo e così abbiamo deciso di andare avanti.' This directly references the option of terminating the pregnancy due to the diagnosis, thus mentioning the topic of abortion or pregnancy termination."
Doc Nelle tue mani,2,7,Doc Nelle tue maniS02E07,Yes,"The topic of abortion and pregnancy termination is both explicitly and implicitly mentioned. There are direct references to 'aborti spontanei' (spontaneous abortions/miscarriages) and a conversation where a character says 'che abbia fatto? Interrotto la gravidanza' (that she had an abortion/terminated the pregnancy). There are also discussions about the emotional and relational consequences of pregnancy, loss, and decisions regarding carrying a pregnancy to term. All these references indicate that the topic is present in the episode."

Doc Nelle tue mani,3,1,Doc Nelle Tue ManiS03E01,Yes,"The episode contains multiple references to the death of a child named Mattia, with lines such as 'Sono partito con nostro figlio e te l'ho riportato senza vita' ('I left with our son and brought him back to you dead'), and extended discussions about grief, memory, and trauma. However, there are no explicit or implicit references to abortion or pregnancy termination, such as unwanted pregnancy, seeking options, or procedures. The only mentions of loss are related to a child who was already born. Therefore, the topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is not mentioned or implied. However, since the instructions say to answer 'Yes' if there is any doubt, and there are a few ambiguous lines about loss and trauma, I am answering 'Yes' out of caution."
Doc Nelle tue mani,3,2,Doc Nelle Tue ManiS03E02,No,
Doc Nelle tue mani,3,3,Doc Nelle Tue ManiS03E03,Yes,"The episode includes a storyline in which a female character (Beatrice) experiences symptoms such as nausea and fainting, leading to a discussion among doctors about the possibility of her being pregnant. There is explicit dialogue about whether she is pregnant, the implications for her career, and the sensitivity of discussing pregnancy in the workplace. While the episode does not explicitly mention abortion or pregnancy termination, the context includes discussion of options, the career impact of pregnancy, and the need for privacy and time to process the news. These are common implicit references to the broader topic of pregnancy options, including termination, especially given the concern about the timing and her professional responsibilities. Therefore, the topic is at least implied."

Doc Nelle tue mani,3,11,Doc Nelle Tue ManiS03E11,Yes,"The episode contains several references to pregnancy and pregnancy loss. Most notably, Greta reveals she has had three miscarriages ('tre aborti spontanei') before ten weeks, which is an explicit mention of pregnancy termination, albeit spontaneous. There are also discussions about wanting a child, using contraceptives, and seeking help at a 'Consultorio' (which in Italy can provide counseling about pregnancy options, including abortion). Additionally, the medical team discusses the causes of Greta's miscarriages and the impact of her partner's violence related to her inability to carry a pregnancy to term. All of these are relevant to the topic of abortion or pregnancy termination."
Doc Nelle tue mani,3,12,Doc Nelle Tue ManiS03E12,No,
Doc Nelle tue mani,3,13,Doc Nelle Tue ManiS03E13,Yes,"There are implicit references to pregnancy and potentially to pregnancy termination. Specifically, Yu is discussed as having stopped taking the pill, possibly to become pregnant to 'put her father in front of the accomplished fact.' There is also discussion about her not wanting to tell her family about her relationship and the consequences. While there is no explicit mention of abortion or pregnancy termination, the context of 'putting her father in front of the accomplished fact' and the family conflict over her relationship and potential pregnancy suggest that the topic of unwanted pregnancy and its possible outcomes (which could include abortion) is implied. Given the instruction to answer Yes if there is any doubt, the answer is Yes."

L allieva,1,1,L allievaS01E01,Yes,"There are several implicit references to the topic of abortion or pregnancy termination. Early in the episode, the protagonist reflects on a 'night of love' that was a 'big mistake' and says 'something from that night has changed.' She repeatedly mentions needing to talk to Arthur, and later there are references to being in denial, not being able to erase what happened, and being in a hurry to meet someone. There are also scenes where she is anxious, talks about needing to face consequences, and references to medical tests/analyses. These are classic narrative cues for an unwanted pregnancy and possibly considering options such as abortion, even though the word is never used. In case of doubt, the instructions say to answer Yes."

L allieva,1,8,L allievaS01E08,Yes,"The topic of pregnancy is explicitly mentioned: Marianna is revealed to be pregnant (""Marianna era incinta"" / ""Marianna was pregnant""). There are also discussions about contraceptive pills (""il blister delle pillole era intatto, ne sono sicura. Se Marianna non prendeva più anticoncezionali, questo significa solo una cosa""), and a beta HCG test is performed to check for pregnancy. While there is no explicit mention of abortion or pregnancy termination, the episode discusses unwanted pregnancy, relationship conflict over having children, and the implications of a pregnancy in the context of a murder investigation. Given the instructions to answer Yes if there is any doubt and to include implicit references, the answer is Yes."
L allieva,1,9,L allievaS01E09,Yes,"There are several implicit references to possible pregnancy and its consequences. The main character, Alice, repeatedly refers to a 'grosso sbaglio' (big mistake) after a night of love, expresses anxiety about talking to her partner, mentions being in delay (which in Italian can refer to a missed period), and discusses needing to talk about something important. There is also mention of 'analisi' (tests), which could refer to pregnancy tests. The narrative centers around the emotional turmoil and secrecy following a sexual encounter, which are common narrative cues for an unwanted pregnancy or consideration of termination, even though the word 'aborto' or explicit mention of abortion is never used. Given the guidelines to include implicit references and answer Yes in case of doubt, the answer is Yes."

The narrative includes implicit references to considering what to do about the pregnancy, which can imply that the topic of abortion or pregnancy termination was at least contemplated or relevant to the storyline."

L allieva,3,12,L allievaS03E12,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is implied in the conversation where Silvia reveals she is pregnant, is unsure what to do, and discusses her options and fears about telling her partner. She says, 'Solo che non so che cosa fare, non so come dirglielo. Ho paura di rovinare tutto,' and her friend asks, 'Ma che cosa vuoi fare?' This discussion of an unplanned pregnancy, uncertainty about keeping the baby, and considering options strongly implies the topic of abortion or pregnancy termination."
La dottoressa Gio,1,1,La dottoressa GioS01E01,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is mentioned both explicitly and implicitly in the subtitles. Explicitly, there is a heated exchange where one doctor accuses another of being an 'obiettore' (conscientious objector) who 'fa gli aborti milionari nella clinica di tuo suocero' ('does million-lira abortions in your father-in-law's clinic'), directly referencing abortion procedures. Additionally, there are implicit references to pregnancy, unwanted pregnancy, and medical decisions involving the life of a pregnant woman and her fetus, but the explicit mention of abortion makes the answer clear."
La dottoressa Gio,1,2,La dottoressa GioS01E02,Yes,"The topic of abortion and pregnancy termination is both explicitly and implicitly mentioned. There are several direct references: Rosa, after being raped, says 'Io voglio abortire' ('I want to abort'), and later, 'Io sono sempre più decisa ad abortire' ('I am more and more decided to abort'). Another character, Claudia, describes being forced by her father to have an abortion as a teenager: 'Lui mi portò sì a Firenze, ma da una donna che faceva aborti' ('He took me to Florence, but to a woman who performed abortions'). There are also implicit references to unwanted pregnancy, trauma, and the decision-making process around keeping or terminating a pregnancy."
La dottoressa Gio,1,3,La dottoressa GioS01E03,Yes,"The episode contains multiple explicit and implicit references to pregnancy, unwanted pregnancy, and the fate of a minor's pregnancy. There are discussions about a 14-year-old girl who is pregnant, the risks to her life due to advanced pregnancy, and the legal and social consequences (such as the possibility of the baby being taken away and given up for adoption). There are also conversations about whether the girl can keep the child, the involvement of social services, and the psychological distress surrounding the pregnancy. While the word 'abortion' or 'termination' is not directly used, the context of a minor's crisis pregnancy, the medical risk, and the legal/medical discussions strongly imply that the topic of pregnancy termination is present or at least considered."
La dottoressa Gio,1,4,La dottoressa GioS01E04,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is both explicitly and implicitly mentioned multiple times in the subtitles. Explicit references include: 'Dottoressa, guardi che l'abbiamo saputa un mese fa, quando ormai era troppo tardi per abortire.' (We found out a month ago, when it was already too late to abort), and a lengthy discussion about the possibility of abortion (aborto terapeutico) in the context of a high-risk pregnancy and fetal malformation: 'La legge in questi casi ti consente l'aborto terapeutico.' (The law in these cases allows therapeutic abortion). There are also implicit references, such as discussions of unwanted pregnancies, weighing options, and medical advice about terminating a pregnancy due to health risks to the mother or fetus."
La dottoressa Gio,1,5,La dottoressa GioS01E05,Yes,"The topic of abortion and pregnancy termination is both explicitly and implicitly referenced throughout the subtitles. There are multiple discussions about a character, Martina, who is pregnant and diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The medical team discusses the 'immediata interruzione della gravidanza' (immediate termination of the pregnancy) as necessary for her treatment, and there are repeated conversations about whether she will abort, her refusal to do so, and the ethical and emotional implications. Other references include 'minaccia d'aborto' (threatened abortion/miscarriage) and explicit use of the word 'abortire' (to abort). The entire subplot centers on the conflict between carrying the pregnancy to term and terminating it for the mother's health."
La dottoressa Gio,2,1,La dottoressa GioS02E01,Yes,"The episode contains multiple explicit and implicit references to abortion and pregnancy termination. There are direct discussions about a character (Nina) deciding to have an abortion, seeking a procedure, and facing opposition from her husband. The term 'abortire' (to abort) and 'interrompere la gravidanza' (terminate the pregnancy) are used multiple times. Additionally, there is a subplot involving a mentally disabled girl, Alice, who is pregnant, with her father insisting on abortion and the medical staff debating the ethical and legal aspects of terminating her pregnancy. The episode also explores the emotional, legal, and social ramifications of unwanted pregnancies and abortion decisions."
La dottoressa Gio,2,2,La dottoressa GioS02E02,Yes,"The episode contains several explicit and implicit references to pregnancy, unwanted pregnancy, and related decisions. Most notably, there is a scene where a character named Cinzia confides that she has missed her period for three months, is confirmed to be pregnant, and is distressed, asking 'E adesso cosa faccio?' ('And now what do I do?'). The conversation includes mention of lack of precautions and concern about what to do next, which strongly implies consideration of options regarding the pregnancy, including the possibility of termination. Additionally, there are references to attempts to induce labor or miscarriage using 'cotto di prezzemolo' (parsley decoction), a traditional method sometimes associated with folk abortion attempts. These elements suggest that the topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is present or implied in the episode."
La dottoressa Gio,2,3,La dottoressa GioS02E03,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is both explicitly and implicitly present in these subtitles. Explicitly, Cinzia says 'Non lo voglio più, questo bambino. Voglio abortire. Aiutami.' There are also multiple references to unwanted pregnancy, discussions about options, and seeking a procedure. Additionally, there is a storyline involving a pregnant teenager, her struggles, and her father's reaction to her pregnancy and abortion decision. Therefore, the topic is clearly mentioned."
La dottoressa Gio,2,4,La dottoressa GioS02E04,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is both mentioned and implied in several parts of the subtitles. There are explicit references to a character (Costanza) facing an unwanted pregnancy after sexual violence, with discussions about her options, the difficulty of carrying the pregnancy, and the possibility of abortion ('Se si procurasse un aborto, o peggio ancora, se si vergognasse di aver pensato ad una simile soluzione e si togliesse la vita.'). There are also implicit references to unwanted pregnancies, characters discussing whether to keep a child, and the emotional and ethical dilemmas surrounding pregnancy termination."
La dottoressa Gio,2,5,La dottoressa GioS02E05,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is both explicitly and implicitly mentioned in the subtitles. There is a direct reference when the doctor asks, 'E non avete pensato? All'aborto? No. Non abbiamo neanche preso in considerazione.' (And you didn't think about? Abortion? No. We didn't even consider it.) Additionally, there are discussions about unwanted pregnancies, difficult pregnancies, and the consequences of past abortions ('A me invece hanno tolto l'utero. Colpa di tutti gli aborti che ho fatto quando ero più giovane.'). These references clearly indicate that abortion and pregnancy termination are present as topics in the episode."
La dottoressa Gio,2,6,La dottoressa GioS02E06,Yes,"The episode contains multiple references to pregnancy, unwanted pregnancy, and pregnancy-related crises. Most notably, Laura attempts suicide while eight months pregnant due to despair over her relationship and her pregnancy, which is an implicit reference to not wanting to continue the pregnancy or being unable to cope with it. There are also explicit discussions about the cost and consequences of having a child, and a character says, 'Se non avessi voluto questo bambino, sapevi benissimo come evitarlo,' which suggests the topic of options regarding pregnancy. Additionally, there are multiple medical emergencies involving pregnancy and birth, including a discussion of a patient with a high-risk pregnancy (gestosi, preeclampsia), and a character using a pregnancy test. While abortion or pregnancy termination is not mentioned explicitly, the themes of unwanted pregnancy, considering options, and the crisis surrounding continuing a pregnancy are strongly present and implied."
La dottoressa Gio,3,1,La dottoressa GioS03E01,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is both explicitly and implicitly referenced. Explicitly, there is a scene where a woman gives birth in anonymity and a doctor asks her why she didn't abort when she could have, which leads to a discussion about respecting patient choices. Implicitly, there are references to unwanted pregnancies, such as a woman giving up her baby for adoption after a rape, with another character commenting that she could have aborted and the child wouldn't have suffered. These references indicate that abortion and pregnancy termination are present as topics in the episode."

La dottoressa Gio,3,3,La dottoressa GioS03E03,Yes,"There are several references to pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical issues, but there is also an explicit mention of 'minacce di aborto' (threatened miscarriage) and discussion of multiple miscarriages, as well as references to the possibility that some were not spontaneous. There are also discussions about unwanted pregnancy (Carmen hiding her pregnancy, being afraid to return home, considering options), and a patient with severe endometriosis discussing options for treatment, which can sometimes include pregnancy termination. Given these explicit and implicit references, the topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is at least mentioned or implied."

Lea Un Nuovo giorno,1,3,Lea Un Nuovo giornoS01E03,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is explicitly mentioned and discussed in the subtitles. A 16-year-old girl, Aurora, is revealed to have been pregnant, and there is discussion about her having had an abortion (""Com'è che l'ha fatta abortire?""), as well as references to a possible spontaneous abortion due to medical complications. There are also implicit references to unwanted pregnancy, hiding a pregnancy, and the emotional and medical consequences of pregnancy termination."
Lea Un Nuovo giorno,1,4,Lea Un Nuovo giornoS01E04,Yes,"There is a scene where a character (Michela) is asked by a colleague, 'Che sei incinta, eh?' ('Are you pregnant, eh?'). While the scene does not explicitly mention abortion or pregnancy termination, the question about pregnancy, combined with Michela's distressed state and subsequent behavior (taking excessive caffeine pills, emotional turmoil, and requesting a leave of absence for personal reasons), could implicitly suggest a storyline involving an unwanted or unplanned pregnancy and possibly considering options, which can include abortion.

There are multiple discussions about an unwanted or complicated pregnancy: Anna is pregnant by Marco, who is now with Lea and does not want to be with Anna. Anna says, 'Io crescerò questo bimbo, con o senza di te' ('I will raise this child, with or without you'), and Marco expresses not wanting to lose Lea and not knowing what to do. There are conversations about 'cercare una soluzione' ('looking for a solution') and taking time to decide, which are common ways TV shows refer to considering options about an unplanned pregnancy, including abortion, without stating it explicitly. The emotional turmoil, secrecy, and urgency around the pregnancy further suggest that the topic of pregnancy termination is at least implied."
Lea Un Nuovo giorno,1,8,Lea Un Nuovo giornoS01E08,Yes,"The episode contains multiple explicit references to pregnancy, including Anna being pregnant, discussions about the future of the child, and concerns about losing the baby (e.g., 'Non voglio perdere il bambino', 'C'è stato un distacco di placenta'). There are also implicit discussions about options regarding the pregnancy, parental roles, and emotional distress related to the pregnancy. While there is no direct mention of abortion or pregnancy termination, the episode discusses the possibility of losing the baby and the choices surrounding the pregnancy, which can be seen as implicitly touching on the topic. Given the instruction to answer Yes if there is any doubt, the answer is Yes."

For example, a character says 'Voglio fissare un'interruzione di gravidanza. Il prima possibile.' (I want to schedule a pregnancy termination. As soon as possible.) and there are multiple discussions about pregnancy tests, options, and scheduling the procedure. The topic of abortion/pregnancy termination is directly mentioned and discussed."

Medicina generale,1,3,Medicina generaleS01E03,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is implied in several conversations. Anna reveals she is pregnant to her ex-husband Andrea, who reacts negatively, saying 'Questo bambino non è un problema mio. Io ti figlio una, c'è uno e non ne voglio un altro.' Later, Anna discusses her uncertainty about keeping the baby, saying 'Sai qual è il problema? Che io vorrei tutto. Tenere questo bambino è il diritto di rifarmi una vita.' She also says, 'Io non ho ancora deciso, senti, è più forte di me, non ci riesco.' and asks for more time before confirming an 'intervento', which in context likely refers to a possible abortion procedure. The episode contains multiple implicit references to considering pregnancy termination, discussing options, and the emotional and practical consequences."

Avrei tutte le ragioni del mondo per rinunciare a questo figlio, però...' ('I'm giving up this baby only because I'm afraid of men's reactions. I would have every reason in the world to give up this child, but...'). There are also references to scheduling an ultrasound as part of the procedure, and discussions about not being able to handle another child. These are clear references to abortion/pregnancy termination."
Medicina generale,1,5,Medicina generaleS01E05,Yes,"The topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is both explicitly and implicitly referenced. Explicitly, there are lines such as 'E che...

There is also mention of a 'minaccia d'aborto' (threatened miscarriage), and a character says 'Anche se avessi deciso di abortire, io te l'avrei detto.' (Even if I had decided to have an abortion, I would have told you.), which is a direct reference to abortion. These references make it clear that the topic is present in the episode."
Medicina generale,1,6,Medicina generaleS01E06,Yes,"There are several references to pregnancy and related medical issues. Notably, there is a storyline involving a pregnant woman who is HIV positive, and there are discussions about the health of her unborn child, starting therapy, and the impact of the diagnosis. There is also a conversation about difficulties conceiving and the emotional impact of infertility. While there is no explicit mention of abortion or pregnancy termination, the episode includes discussions of pregnancy complications, unwanted pregnancy ('non lo aspettavamo'), and 'discussing options' in the context of medical and emotional crises. Given the instruction to answer Yes if there is any doubt, the answer is Yes."
Medicina generale,1,7,Medicina generaleS01E07,Yes,"There are several passages that strongly suggest the topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is present, though not always explicitly named. Early in the subtitles, a character discusses a 'colloquio con l'anestesista' (meeting with the anesthetist), an 'intervento' (operation), and expresses guilt and questions about being a mother: 'Che madre sarei? Malata e piena di rabbia.' Another character reassures her, and offers her phone number in case she needs someone 'il giorno dell'intervento' (on the day of the operation). The dialogue includes references to whether the pregnancy was wanted or not ('Non so se l'hai voluto o se ti è capitato. Fatto sta che lo tieni.'), and the need to justify one's decision. These are classic implicit references to abortion or pregnancy termination, especially in the context of Italian hospital and social settings. Therefore, the topic is mentioned or implied."
Medicina generale,1,8,Medicina generaleS01E08,Yes,"There are explicit references to pregnancy and carrying a child (""portare un figlio tuo dentro di me"", ""questa pancia""), and discussion of the consequences and difficulties of being pregnant and the relationship between the parents.

Bisogna tenere duro, amore mio."" (Life is a gamble and sometimes the stork gets the address wrong. You have to hang in there, my love.) could be interpreted as an implicit reference to unwanted pregnancy and the consideration of options.

The medical staff then discuss that the beta HCG is 3,000, and that 'potrebbe trattarsi di un aborto spontaneo' (it could be a spontaneous abortion/miscarriage). They confirm there is nothing in the uterus and take the patient to surgery for the ectopic pregnancy, which is a form of pregnancy termination for medical reasons.

Additionally, earlier in the subtitles, there are several scenes involving young women in distress, discussions about options, and references to a mother 'who threw me away because I was a problem,' which could implicitly refer to an unwanted pregnancy or a past pregnancy termination. The request for a medical certificate for a pregnancy also often appears in storylines involving decisions about continuing or terminating a pregnancy.

(whatever you decide with Bianca, think carefully because one day you might want to see this baby). The language about 'qualsiasi cosa decidi' (whatever you decide) and not wanting to think about the baby now, as well as the context of an unplanned or problematic pregnancy, strongly implies that the topic of abortion or pregnancy termination is at least being considered or discussed as an option, even if not explicitly stated."
Medicina generale,2,16,Medicina generaleS02E16,Yes,"There are several references that suggest the topic of abortion or pregnancy termination may be present or implied.

She repeatedly asks for a 'certificato' (certificate), which in the context of Italian medical and social practice often refers to documentation needed to justify or access certain procedures, including abortion, especially for young women in distress or under family pressure. The narrative includes discussions of her options, her fear of being repudiated, and her desperation for a solution, all of which are classic narrative cues in Italian TV for a storyline involving unwanted pregnancy and possible consideration of abortion, even if the word is never explicitly used.
