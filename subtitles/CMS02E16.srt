1
00:00:00,773 --> 00:00:02,834
Incoming, peds in respiratory distress.

2
00:00:02,859 --> 00:00:04,926
- 30 seconds out.
- We got this.

3
00:00:06,742 --> 00:00:08,329
Hey, love.

4
00:00:08,781 --> 00:00:10,123
What are you doing here?

5
00:00:10,148 --> 00:00:12,194
Aren't you supposed to be
home taking care of yourself?

6
00:00:12,219 --> 00:00:13,685
I don't wanna stay at home.

7
00:00:13,687 --> 00:00:15,888
Just can't stop thinking about things.

8
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,090
I'd rather be here, busy.

9
00:00:18,092 --> 00:00:19,258
You sure?

10
00:00:21,328 --> 00:00:22,594
Since we lost the baby,

11
00:00:22,596 --> 00:00:25,030
things with me and
Tate are just different.

12
00:00:25,032 --> 00:00:26,732
I need to work.

13
00:00:26,734 --> 00:00:28,867
All right, well, you tell
me if you need anything.

14
00:00:28,869 --> 00:00:31,503
- Okay? You got this?
- Mm-hmm.

15
00:00:31,505 --> 00:00:33,205
You're going to Treatment 2.

16
00:00:33,207 --> 00:00:34,706
Emergency landing at O'Hare.

17
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:36,742
7-year-old girl collapsed mid-flight.

18
00:00:36,744 --> 00:00:39,244
Acute shortness of breath
started on the plane.

19
00:00:39,246 --> 00:00:42,047
One albuterol and one
racemic epi given en route.

20
00:00:42,049 --> 00:00:44,016
- Sats?
- Uh, low 90s.

21
00:00:44,018 --> 00:00:46,038
Meds didn't do much.

22
00:00:46,187 --> 00:00:48,382
All right, gently.

23
00:00:48,722 --> 00:00:50,222
One, two, three.

24
00:00:50,224 --> 00:00:51,757
Mommy?

25
00:00:54,495 --> 00:00:56,295
She's just telling her
daughter to be calm.

26
00:00:56,297 --> 00:00:57,896
We speak English.

27
00:00:57,898 --> 00:00:59,631
Lungs sound congested...
rhonchi throughout.

28
00:00:59,633 --> 00:01:01,667
Let's get a chest X-ray. I'm Dr. Choi.

29
00:01:01,669 --> 00:01:03,368
I'm gonna be taking
care of your daughter.

30
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:05,103
- Where are you traveling from?
- Ecuador.

31
00:01:05,105 --> 00:01:07,105
All right, has your daughter
ingested any drugs? Alcohol?

32
00:01:07,107 --> 00:01:08,740
- Anything we should be aware of?
- No.

33
00:01:08,742 --> 00:01:10,108
Any medical issues
we should be aware of?

34
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,743
She can never get enough air.

35
00:01:11,745 --> 00:01:13,345
Her lips are always blue.

36
00:01:13,347 --> 00:01:15,314
Her whole life, the
doctor in my village...

37
00:01:15,316 --> 00:01:16,648
she says she can't help.

38
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,984
We were going to Minneapolis
to see a heart doctor.

39
00:01:18,986 --> 00:01:20,152
Definitely volume overloaded.

40
00:01:20,154 --> 00:01:21,920
Let's get five milligrams of Lasix IV.

41
00:01:21,922 --> 00:01:24,271
BP, 108 over 82.

42
00:01:24,758 --> 00:01:27,025
- Heart rate, 110.
- Could be a pulmonary issue,

43
00:01:27,027 --> 00:01:28,794
or any number of
congenital heart defects.

44
00:01:28,796 --> 00:01:30,896
Let's get an EKG, and call CT.

45
00:01:30,898 --> 00:01:32,831
We're gonna do everything
we can for your daughter.

46
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:34,214
Thank you.

47
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:38,565
- Incoming. Dr. Manning?
- Yep.

48
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:41,273
Teresa Azen, 25.

49
00:01:41,275 --> 00:01:43,008
Persistent vegetative state.

50
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,943
Brought in by her
long-term care facility

51
00:01:44,945 --> 00:01:46,812
after blood was discovered in her urine.

52
00:01:46,814 --> 00:01:50,515
Now let's get vitals, a
temp, CBC, CMP, UA with C&S.

53
00:01:50,517 --> 00:01:52,050
Could just be a UTI,

54
00:01:52,052 --> 00:01:53,852
but let's look at her
kidneys with an ultrasound

55
00:01:53,854 --> 00:01:55,954
- to rule out hydro from a stone.
- Got it.

56
00:01:55,956 --> 00:01:58,990
All right, on my count, one, two, three.

57
00:02:01,028 --> 00:02:03,053
- Brain injury?
- Car crash.

58
00:02:05,566 --> 00:02:06,798
Teresa, I'm Dr. Manning.

59
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,300
I'm gonna take good care of you, okay?

60
00:02:11,443 --> 00:02:13,176
G-tube looks good.

61
00:02:15,476 --> 00:02:17,331
Temp, 100.6.

62
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,623
Unresponsive.

63
00:02:32,626 --> 00:02:35,239
No kidney stones. Let's
look at the bladder.

64
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:41,800
How long did you say she was
in a vegetative state for?

65
00:02:41,802 --> 00:02:43,302
Five years.

66
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:49,093
We need to call the police.
This woman is pregnant.

67
00:02:54,468 --> 00:02:58,850
<font color="#007700">Synced and corrected by Aaronnmb</font>
www.addic7ed.com

68
00:03:01,937 --> 00:03:03,374
There's vaginal trauma,

69
00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:05,483
which explains the blood in the urine.

70
00:03:05,841 --> 00:03:07,351
Thank you.

71
00:03:08,544 --> 00:03:11,125
- Is this our victim?
- Yeah.

72
00:03:11,847 --> 00:03:14,281
It's awful. You ever
see anything like this?

73
00:03:14,283 --> 00:03:16,653
- I wish I could say I hadn't.
- Okay, let's lift.

74
00:03:16,678 --> 00:03:18,850
One, two, three.

75
00:03:19,213 --> 00:03:20,686
So helpless.

76
00:03:22,358 --> 00:03:23,891
We're looking into all of the employees

77
00:03:23,893 --> 00:03:25,364
at Teresa's facility.

78
00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:27,818
We're checking visitor
logs, security footage.

79
00:03:27,843 --> 00:03:29,443
We'll find out who had access to her

80
00:03:29,445 --> 00:03:30,593
and to her floor.

81
00:03:30,618 --> 00:03:32,513
But the rape kit's only
supposed to reveal DNA

82
00:03:32,515 --> 00:03:34,214
for the past five days.

83
00:03:34,216 --> 00:03:36,783
- How is this gonna help?
- I hate to say this,

84
00:03:36,785 --> 00:03:39,386
but the likelihood
in a case like this...

85
00:03:39,388 --> 00:03:42,089
is that the offender's been
assaulting her regularly,

86
00:03:42,091 --> 00:03:44,091
maybe even daily.

87
00:03:45,361 --> 00:03:49,029
Hey, Teresa's parents are here.

88
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:50,476
Okay.

89
00:03:56,005 --> 00:03:57,585
David and Angela Azen,

90
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,765
this is Detective
Lindsay and Dr. Manning.

91
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,750
I am so sorry for what
happened to your daughter.

92
00:04:04,246 --> 00:04:06,480
How could someone do this to her?

93
00:04:06,482 --> 00:04:08,682
Are you gonna catch this monster?

94
00:04:08,684 --> 00:04:11,351
Yes, we've already
opened an investigation,

95
00:04:11,353 --> 00:04:15,346
and finding whoever did this
is a top priority for us.

96
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,990
I just want you to know,

97
00:04:16,992 --> 00:04:20,501
we are gonna give your
daughter the best possible care.

98
00:04:21,297 --> 00:04:24,498
Why don't you go spend some
time with your daughter?

99
00:04:35,044 --> 00:04:37,017
We have 18 patients on this floor,

100
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:40,157
all suffering from
serious mental illnesses.

101
00:04:40,816 --> 00:04:43,650
Since age 13, Henry has been battling

102
00:04:43,652 --> 00:04:47,754
anorexia nervosa coupled with
borderline personality disorder.

103
00:04:47,756 --> 00:04:50,123
Evelyn struggles with schizophrenia,

104
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:53,160
auditory hallucinations, paranoia.

105
00:04:53,162 --> 00:04:54,995
We have her on a new anti-psychotic,

106
00:04:54,997 --> 00:04:57,698
hoping that'll curb
her violent tendencies.

107
00:04:59,468 --> 00:05:00,500
Patients might be here

108
00:05:00,502 --> 00:05:02,903
anywhere from six weeks to six months.

109
00:05:02,905 --> 00:05:04,938
You're not listening!

110
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,574
You don't belong here. Get out!

111
00:05:07,576 --> 00:05:10,077
- Get out!
- That's enough, Tom.

112
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:12,871
Why don't we go work
on your art project?

113
00:05:16,165 --> 00:05:17,643
Who are you?

114
00:05:18,153 --> 00:05:21,822
Uh, I'm Dr. Reese. I'm
visiting from Chicago Med.

115
00:05:21,824 --> 00:05:23,490
He's right.

116
00:05:23,492 --> 00:05:25,383
I don't belong here.

117
00:05:25,717 --> 00:05:28,173
All the doctors think I'm crazy,

118
00:05:28,198 --> 00:05:29,896
but I'm not.

119
00:05:29,898 --> 00:05:32,579
Dr. Reese, we're moving on.

120
00:05:33,204 --> 00:05:34,821
She's the worst.

121
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,174
Hey, just so you know,

122
00:05:41,176 --> 00:05:43,977
"crazy" is a word I never use.

123
00:05:47,241 --> 00:05:49,916
And we've got Ms.
Perreira... post op day two.

124
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:52,719
We removed her chest tube
and wires this morning.

125
00:05:52,721 --> 00:05:55,656
She is tolerating a
diet, and looking good.

126
00:05:55,658 --> 00:05:57,257
She's on a solid dose of morphine.

127
00:05:57,259 --> 00:05:59,192
Ah. And what about consults?

128
00:05:59,194 --> 00:06:01,928
Uh, we have two in the MICU,
one for an aortic valve,

129
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,530
and the other for a potential bypass.

130
00:06:03,532 --> 00:06:05,299
All right. Let's go
have a look, everybody.

131
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:07,134
Uh, just a moment. Uh, one more thing...

132
00:06:07,136 --> 00:06:09,402
more of a question, really.

133
00:06:10,572 --> 00:06:13,507
What does a Jewish pirate say?

134
00:06:16,178 --> 00:06:18,245
I beg your pardon, Dr. Latham?

135
00:06:18,247 --> 00:06:21,754
Ah, what does a Jewish pirate say?

136
00:06:23,752 --> 00:06:25,485
Ahoy vey.

137
00:06:27,323 --> 00:06:29,730
Get it? Ahoy vey.

138
00:06:32,828 --> 00:06:34,728
All right, that's a...

139
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,463
that is a good one, Dr. Latham.

140
00:06:36,465 --> 00:06:39,300
Jewish humor. Long tradition.

141
00:06:39,668 --> 00:06:41,777
Shall we move on to the MICU?

142
00:06:45,441 --> 00:06:47,874
So I take it that your TMS
treatments are going well.

143
00:06:47,876 --> 00:06:51,266
Yes, I've been picking up
on all sorts of subtleties

144
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,979
in the way people communicate.

145
00:06:52,981 --> 00:06:54,915
For instance, it never dawned on me

146
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,747
the profound purpose
behind sharing a joke.

147
00:06:57,772 --> 00:07:00,928
Oh, uh, well, what is it?

148
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,256
Camaraderie, Dr. Rhodes.

149
00:07:03,258 --> 00:07:04,458
Camaraderie.

150
00:07:06,795 --> 00:07:09,329
Hey, check out what I got you.

151
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,653
Mousse de Maracujá.

152
00:07:14,737 --> 00:07:16,336
Your favorite.

153
00:07:16,338 --> 00:07:17,838
When I was, like, eight.

154
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,774
Well, still, I thought it
might make you feel better.

155
00:07:30,652 --> 00:07:32,332
He's trying, April.

156
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:35,989
No one knows what to say.

157
00:07:37,593 --> 00:07:39,371
There's nothing to say.

158
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,905
- How were rounds at the youth hospital?
- Brutal.

159
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,746
I'm sure there's a more
clinical term, but...

160
00:07:48,748 --> 00:07:50,013
I hear ya.

161
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:52,194
It's really hard to
see so many teenagers

162
00:07:52,219 --> 00:07:53,507
suffering from psychological trauma.

163
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:55,642
Yeah, younger patients are the hardest.

164
00:07:55,644 --> 00:07:58,979
Very tough to draw a line
between an actual disorder

165
00:07:58,981 --> 00:08:00,847
and good old-fashioned adolescence.

166
00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:02,749
How do you learn to make that call?

167
00:08:02,751 --> 00:08:05,174
Tourist asks a New Yorker,

168
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,259
"How do you get to Carnegie Hall?"

169
00:08:08,134 --> 00:08:09,526
Practice.

170
00:08:13,032 --> 00:08:14,599
Hi.

171
00:08:14,624 --> 00:08:18,394
So Teresa is approximately ten
weeks along in her pregnancy.

172
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:20,133
Oh, God.

173
00:08:20,135 --> 00:08:24,185
Fortunately, termination
will be a painless procedure.

174
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,005
Wait, termination?

175
00:08:27,464 --> 00:08:29,199
We don't want that.

176
00:08:29,224 --> 00:08:30,924
We wanna keep the baby.

177
00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:32,382
I'm sorry.

178
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,658
I thought, given the circumstances...

179
00:08:34,683 --> 00:08:36,742
Mr. and Mrs. Azen,

180
00:08:36,743 --> 00:08:39,410
nothing has to be decided today.

181
00:08:39,412 --> 00:08:41,579
No, we've made up our mind.

182
00:08:41,581 --> 00:08:44,015
It is terrible what
happened to our daughter,

183
00:08:44,017 --> 00:08:46,741
but even if it came from a rape,

184
00:08:46,766 --> 00:08:48,820
the baby's still part of Teresa.

185
00:08:48,822 --> 00:08:51,155
The only part we have left.

186
00:08:51,157 --> 00:08:53,791
Yes, and I can understand that,

187
00:08:53,793 --> 00:08:55,660
but in your daughter's condition,

188
00:08:55,662 --> 00:08:57,128
I have to tell you,

189
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:01,358
taking this pregnancy to term
would be extremely difficult.

190
00:09:01,868 --> 00:09:03,468
Why? Her brain has been injured,

191
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,699
- but her body's healthy.
- No.

192
00:09:05,905 --> 00:09:09,173
At five years in a persistent
vegetative state, it's not.

193
00:09:09,175 --> 00:09:11,943
This is a high risk situation
for pulmonary embolism,

194
00:09:11,945 --> 00:09:14,846
sepsis, colonic obstruction,
respiratory failure.

195
00:09:14,848 --> 00:09:16,614
But those are just risks, right?

196
00:09:16,616 --> 00:09:17,749
It could all work out.

197
00:09:17,751 --> 00:09:20,484
They are extremely high risks.

198
00:09:20,509 --> 00:09:22,653
If you have your daughter go
through with this pregnancy,

199
00:09:22,655 --> 00:09:26,243
there is a chance that
she will not survive.

200
00:09:26,726 --> 00:09:29,055
She's hardly living as it is.

201
00:09:29,763 --> 00:09:34,198
If she dies giving birth,
maybe that's a merciful outcome.

202
00:09:36,155 --> 00:09:38,288
Sometimes, I've wished for that.

203
00:09:40,707 --> 00:09:43,074
There is another issue to consider.

204
00:09:43,076 --> 00:09:45,276
Given the abuse your
daughter has undergone,

205
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:48,766
do you believe that she would
want to keep this pregnancy?

206
00:09:49,961 --> 00:09:51,812
In any case,

207
00:09:52,152 --> 00:09:55,052
you are Teresa's guardians,

208
00:09:55,054 --> 00:09:57,688
and therefore speak on her behalf.

209
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,924
Your wishes will be honored.

210
00:10:04,531 --> 00:10:07,598
So based on the echo and the CT scans,

211
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,568
your daughter is suffering from
a congenital heart condition

212
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:13,805
known as Tetralogy of Fallot.

213
00:10:13,807 --> 00:10:15,306
It's a condition that puts

214
00:10:15,308 --> 00:10:17,074
a significant amount
of stress on the heart,

215
00:10:17,076 --> 00:10:19,444
and it's something that needs
to be addressed surgically.

216
00:10:19,446 --> 00:10:21,345
I can pay. I bought travel insurance.

217
00:10:21,347 --> 00:10:24,325
It's an emergency surgery.
We would operate regardless.

218
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,217
We'll take your daughter
to the pediatric ICU,

219
00:10:26,219 --> 00:10:27,885
and get her ready.

220
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,957
Are you all right? I know this is a lot.

221
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,226
- I'm fine.
- Mommy?

222
00:10:42,101 --> 00:10:44,550
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, you sure you're okay?

223
00:10:44,575 --> 00:10:46,337
- Maybe I should take a look at you.
- No, no.

224
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:48,039
I haven't had anything to eat...

225
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,041
no sleep. I'll be okay.

226
00:10:51,578 --> 00:10:54,812
Hey, April, so sorry
to hear about the baby.

227
00:10:54,814 --> 00:10:57,867
- How you holding up?
- It's okay. I'm okay.

228
00:11:10,516 --> 00:11:12,179
T-2. Talk to me, Cesar.

229
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:13,570
Suicide attempt.

230
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:15,405
15-year-old female from County Psych.

231
00:11:15,407 --> 00:11:17,307
She swallowed bleach, sodium hydroxide,

232
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:18,688
and some sort of rust remover.

233
00:11:18,713 --> 00:11:20,377
Hydrofluoric acid.

234
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:22,579
Okay, call toxicology,
get an NG tube in her,

235
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:24,070
push an amp of calcium gluconate,

236
00:11:24,095 --> 00:11:25,468
and hang a magnesium drip.

237
00:11:25,493 --> 00:11:26,547
Watch for V-tach,

238
00:11:26,548 --> 00:11:27,761
- and get a psych consult.
- Got it.

239
00:11:27,786 --> 00:11:29,519
You have to get Dr. Reese for me.

240
00:11:29,521 --> 00:11:31,140
I need to talk to her.

241
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,537
I wasn't trying to commit suicide.

242
00:11:38,562 --> 00:11:40,195
I was trying to see you.

243
00:11:40,197 --> 00:11:42,163
Do you believe it's
okay to hurt yourself?

244
00:11:42,165 --> 00:11:43,932
How else could I get to you?

245
00:11:43,934 --> 00:11:45,967
It's not like I can
ask for a phone call.

246
00:11:45,969 --> 00:11:48,870
Nancy, you... you could
have seriously hurt

247
00:11:48,872 --> 00:11:50,505
or even killed yourself.

248
00:11:50,507 --> 00:11:52,907
You have to help me get out of there.

249
00:11:52,909 --> 00:11:55,744
They locked me up after I
got in a fight with my mom,

250
00:11:55,746 --> 00:11:57,979
but she's bipolar... has been for years.

251
00:11:57,981 --> 00:12:00,782
Hey, I'm sorry, but I'm...
I'm not your psychiatrist.

252
00:12:00,784 --> 00:12:02,584
My mom came at me with a hammer

253
00:12:02,586 --> 00:12:04,452
while I was sleeping.

254
00:12:04,454 --> 00:12:06,454
I was trying to defend myself.

255
00:12:06,479 --> 00:12:08,062
That doesn't make me crazy.

256
00:12:08,091 --> 00:12:10,492
No. If that were the situation,

257
00:12:10,494 --> 00:12:12,527
it would be reasonable
to defend yourself.

258
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:13,836
See?

259
00:12:14,831 --> 00:12:17,086
You're the only one who said that.

260
00:12:17,467 --> 00:12:19,400
All the other doctors
think I'm psychotic,

261
00:12:19,402 --> 00:12:21,861
but my mom's the one who's crazy.

262
00:12:22,272 --> 00:12:23,947
Dr. Reese?

263
00:12:24,107 --> 00:12:26,096
Could I speak to you for a second?

264
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,376
I'll be right back.

265
00:12:33,316 --> 00:12:35,583
Yeah, could... could you,
uh... could you fill me in?

266
00:12:35,585 --> 00:12:38,286
I understand that you
ran into Nancy on...

267
00:12:38,288 --> 00:12:40,255
- on rounds this morning?
- Yes.

268
00:12:40,257 --> 00:12:43,024
Uh-huh. Could you have said anything

269
00:12:43,026 --> 00:12:44,359
to make her think it was a good idea

270
00:12:44,361 --> 00:12:45,927
to come over here and... and see you?

271
00:12:45,929 --> 00:12:49,497
All I said was "crazy"
isn't a word I ever use.

272
00:12:49,499 --> 00:12:52,801
Huh. Gotta be very careful

273
00:12:52,803 --> 00:12:55,103
the way we talk to
younger psych patients.

274
00:12:55,105 --> 00:12:57,739
You know, they're much more
vulnerable to mixed messages.

275
00:12:57,741 --> 00:13:00,642
She seems to think that
you're some sort of ally.

276
00:13:00,644 --> 00:13:02,328
I am.

277
00:13:02,353 --> 00:13:03,486
Aren't we all?

278
00:13:03,511 --> 00:13:05,544
To get her the right
treatment, of course,

279
00:13:05,569 --> 00:13:07,626
but this is a young woman

280
00:13:07,651 --> 00:13:10,538
who purposefully drank
extremely toxic chemicals.

281
00:13:10,547 --> 00:13:12,647
I mean, Nancy's been diagnosed with

282
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:14,983
borderline personality disorder.

283
00:13:14,985 --> 00:13:17,452
She has severe bouts
of manic depression.

284
00:13:17,454 --> 00:13:20,922
Uncontrollable hysteria,
paranoid delusions.

285
00:13:20,924 --> 00:13:22,691
People who suffer from these disorders

286
00:13:22,693 --> 00:13:25,627
can be very persuasive,
very manipulative,

287
00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:27,362
and a danger to themselves,

288
00:13:27,364 --> 00:13:29,130
so we just... we have to be careful.

289
00:13:29,132 --> 00:13:31,733
We wouldn't wanna put her in a position

290
00:13:31,735 --> 00:13:33,972
where she wanted to harm herself again.

291
00:13:38,608 --> 00:13:40,108
Ms. Cespedes?

292
00:13:42,612 --> 00:13:44,579
Can I get your signature
on this consent?

293
00:13:44,581 --> 00:13:46,564
This gives us permission to operate.

294
00:13:55,492 --> 00:13:57,025
Ms. Cespedes, you don't look well to me.

295
00:13:57,027 --> 00:13:58,793
You could've picked up
a virus while traveling.

296
00:13:58,795 --> 00:14:01,111
May I please check your pulse?

297
00:14:01,398 --> 00:14:03,932
- Is everything all right?
- I told you I'm fine.

298
00:14:03,934 --> 00:14:05,100
Please.

299
00:14:05,102 --> 00:14:06,701
Let's go back to the
Emergency Department,

300
00:14:06,703 --> 00:14:08,303
and let me take a look at you.

301
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:11,296
Just show me where the
bathroom is, please.

302
00:14:11,942 --> 00:14:13,164
Yeah.

303
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:14,700
Follow me.

304
00:14:25,622 --> 00:14:28,389
Hey. Her parents here?

305
00:14:28,391 --> 00:14:30,825
No, making calls outside...

306
00:14:30,827 --> 00:14:33,561
- Looking for a new care facility.
- Mm.

307
00:14:33,563 --> 00:14:35,230
Did you hear they wanna
keep the pregnancy?

308
00:14:35,232 --> 00:14:36,915
Mm-hmm.

309
00:14:37,033 --> 00:14:39,868
When you can't talk, you
don't get to say nothing.

310
00:14:40,403 --> 00:14:42,904
Yeah, well, I don't think
it's the right thing.

311
00:14:42,906 --> 00:14:44,506
Mm.

312
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:45,854
Maggie?

313
00:14:48,845 --> 00:14:50,712
- Did you see that?
- Mm-hmm.

314
00:14:50,714 --> 00:14:53,515
I know PVS patients do
that, and it's just a reflex,

315
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:56,718
but didn't it seem like
there was more going on?

316
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,721
Ah, wishful thinking.

317
00:15:00,891 --> 00:15:03,158
Teresa, can you hear me?

318
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,094
If you can hear me,
please open your eyes.

319
00:15:15,038 --> 00:15:17,605
Teresa, if you can hear me,

320
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,364
squeeze my hand.

321
00:15:26,183 --> 00:15:29,324
In my time at the vent
farm, I've seen this a lot...

322
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,910
blinking, spasms,

323
00:15:31,935 --> 00:15:34,238
sudden jerks of movement.

324
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:37,225
Never ends up meaning
what you want it to.

325
00:15:43,599 --> 00:15:45,666
Let's get a CT brain.

326
00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:49,166
- On a five-year coma patient?
- Just in case.

327
00:15:58,014 --> 00:16:00,014
Hey, Sarah,

328
00:16:00,016 --> 00:16:01,649
you, uh... you got a second?

329
00:16:01,651 --> 00:16:03,952
- Hm?
- I heard that, uh,

330
00:16:03,954 --> 00:16:06,020
most of the psych residents get therapy.

331
00:16:06,022 --> 00:16:07,538
Yeah.

332
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:10,562
- Have you tried it?
- Uh-huh.

333
00:16:10,861 --> 00:16:13,161
Um, I'm... I'm sorry. Can we talk later?

334
00:16:13,163 --> 00:16:15,029
Sure. Yeah.

335
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,733
How's she doing?

336
00:16:18,735 --> 00:16:20,301
Well, we've flushed her pretty good.

337
00:16:20,303 --> 00:16:21,603
She'll be medically cleared soon,

338
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,771
and will have to go back
to the psych hospital.

339
00:16:25,108 --> 00:16:28,576
- You buy her story?
- I don't know.

340
00:16:28,578 --> 00:16:30,311
She's on a six-month psych hold.

341
00:16:30,313 --> 00:16:32,647
Does she seems like she requires
that much time locked up?

342
00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:36,003
Don't ask me. Psych's way too spongy.

343
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:38,519
In med school, my head-shrink
professor took us to the mall,

344
00:16:38,521 --> 00:16:41,723
and asked us to point out people
we thought were mentally ill.

345
00:16:41,725 --> 00:16:43,800
- No one could agree.
- Hm.

346
00:16:44,217 --> 00:16:46,761
That is when I knew I
wanted to be an ED doc.

347
00:16:46,763 --> 00:16:49,230
- Much clearer business.
- Yeah.

348
00:16:49,232 --> 00:16:50,798
I wish there was a way to evaluate Nancy

349
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,567
like an ED doc.

350
00:16:52,569 --> 00:16:54,168
Well, maybe there is.

351
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:57,071
Like I tell my residents,
always go back to the history.

352
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,963
Mommy?

353
00:17:03,613 --> 00:17:05,252
Mommy?

354
00:17:05,415 --> 00:17:06,915
Where's my mommy?

355
00:17:06,917 --> 00:17:08,580
Hey, Bruna, she's out in
the waiting room right now.

356
00:17:08,605 --> 00:17:09,627
I need her.

357
00:17:09,652 --> 00:17:10,885
You're gonna be okay, sweetheart.

358
00:17:10,887 --> 00:17:12,921
We're gonna take very good care of you.

359
00:17:12,923 --> 00:17:15,971
Marty, uh, now might be a good
time to start the sedation.

360
00:17:15,996 --> 00:17:17,792
Please, I want my mommy.

361
00:17:17,794 --> 00:17:19,327
Hold on, Marty.

362
00:17:21,264 --> 00:17:22,864
I would want my mom too

363
00:17:22,866 --> 00:17:25,840
if I were in a new
place with new people.

364
00:17:35,078 --> 00:17:36,872
You know what?

365
00:17:36,897 --> 00:17:39,180
Everyone here has one job,

366
00:17:39,205 --> 00:17:41,449
and that is to make you feel better.

367
00:17:41,785 --> 00:17:43,584
And by the time we're finished,

368
00:17:43,586 --> 00:17:45,253
you won't have trouble breathing.

369
00:17:45,255 --> 00:17:47,522
You won't faint on airplanes.

370
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,726
You'll be a healthy little girl.

371
00:17:49,993 --> 00:17:51,559
How does that sound to you?

372
00:17:51,561 --> 00:17:54,202
- You can really fix me?
- Yes.

373
00:17:54,819 --> 00:17:57,165
Now I need you to do something for me.

374
00:17:57,167 --> 00:17:59,634
- Can you count to 100?
- In Spanish?

375
00:17:59,636 --> 00:18:02,370
Mm-hmm. And by the time you're finished,

376
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,305
your mother will be right next to you.

377
00:18:04,307 --> 00:18:06,029
I promise.

378
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,308
Uno...

379
00:18:09,646 --> 00:18:11,113
dos...

380
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,613
tres...

381
00:18:21,758 --> 00:18:23,624
- Hey, April.
- Is she still in there?

382
00:18:23,626 --> 00:18:25,026
Says she's okay, but keeps vomiting.

383
00:18:25,028 --> 00:18:26,995
Won't open the door,
so I called maintenance.

384
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,990
Zulmira...

385
00:18:30,496 --> 00:18:31,828
Zulmira, open the door, please.

386
00:18:31,901 --> 00:18:34,248
Hold on. I got this.

387
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,826
Just give me a minute.

388
00:18:39,187 --> 00:18:40,686
Stay away.

389
00:18:44,014 --> 00:18:47,115
It was the only way I
could get her to America.

390
00:18:47,117 --> 00:18:48,816
- April, what's going on?
- I'll be fine.

391
00:18:52,689 --> 00:18:55,323
She just needed a good hospital.

392
00:18:55,325 --> 00:18:56,838
Okay, uh...

393
00:18:56,863 --> 00:18:58,064
she's overdosing!

394
00:18:59,481 --> 00:19:01,914
- How do you know?
- She's a drug mule.

395
00:19:10,332 --> 00:19:12,486
Blood glucose is good,
but tachycardic as hell.

396
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,978
BP's 150 over 110. Heart rate, 150.

397
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,646
There's still two
packets in your stomach.

398
00:19:16,648 --> 00:19:18,248
One of them appears to be leaking.

399
00:19:18,273 --> 00:19:20,596
We need to know. Is it cocaine?

400
00:19:20,987 --> 00:19:22,292
Just so we can help you.

401
00:19:25,761 --> 00:19:26,826
Yes.

402
00:19:26,851 --> 00:19:29,002
Okay, we need to get these
out now before they burst.

403
00:19:29,027 --> 00:19:30,947
Let's get an EGD scope and
70 milligrams of ketamine.

404
00:19:30,972 --> 00:19:33,315
- You can't take it out.
- You'll die of an overdose

405
00:19:33,331 --> 00:19:34,898
if any more cocaine
leaks into your intestine.

406
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,588
- Can you give me medicine?
- No, we need to remove them.

407
00:19:37,613 --> 00:19:39,572
Would you give it to the police?

408
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:42,812
We'll explain the situation to them.

409
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:44,747
No, I can't go to prison in my country.

410
00:19:44,749 --> 00:19:46,215
They'll kill me.

411
00:19:46,217 --> 00:19:48,933
Bruna needs me. She
will starve without me.

412
00:19:50,164 --> 00:19:52,281
Tell Goodwin we need a court
order to remove the drug packets.

413
00:19:52,306 --> 00:19:53,809
She'll be dead by the
time it's approved.

414
00:19:53,834 --> 00:19:55,609
Call PD. Maybe they can
bring a warrant in time.

415
00:19:55,634 --> 00:19:57,982
Please, just leave me alone.

416
00:19:58,007 --> 00:20:01,551
Zulmera, if you don't let us
remove those packets, you will die.

417
00:20:04,327 --> 00:20:06,928
I-I can't go to prison.

418
00:20:09,871 --> 00:20:12,138
Do you want Bruna to
wake up from surgery

419
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,492
and learn that her mother has died?

420
00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:17,531
You can't help her in
any way if you're dead.

421
00:20:18,421 --> 00:20:21,122
Let us keep you alive, please.

422
00:20:23,251 --> 00:20:24,750
- Okay.
- All right, come on, let's go.

423
00:20:24,752 --> 00:20:25,993
Yeah.

424
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,500
You think there's any
chance of brain activity?

425
00:20:40,502 --> 00:20:41,868
I don't see how.

426
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,903
A lot of brain volume loss and atrophy.

427
00:20:43,905 --> 00:20:46,339
This is not the healthy
brain of a 25-year-old.

428
00:20:46,341 --> 00:20:47,540
But even with some atrophy,

429
00:20:47,542 --> 00:20:49,533
couldn't there still be consciousness?

430
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:51,846
What was her Glasgow Coma score?

431
00:20:52,114 --> 00:20:53,752
There was no response.

432
00:20:53,937 --> 00:20:56,549
Yeah, this woman is in a
persistent vegetative state...

433
00:20:56,551 --> 00:20:58,852
my guess, for the rest of her life.

434
00:20:58,854 --> 00:21:01,454
But I'm almost sure I
saw something in her eyes,

435
00:21:01,456 --> 00:21:04,334
like she was aware of us
talking about her or something.

436
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:08,107
Maybe you want that so
much, you're projecting?

437
00:21:08,503 --> 00:21:10,737
I... I don't know.

438
00:21:10,762 --> 00:21:13,095
I do feel terrible for her.

439
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,920
She's pregnant.

440
00:21:15,103 --> 00:21:17,437
She was sexually assaulted
at her care facility,

441
00:21:17,439 --> 00:21:18,859
and her parents wanna keep the baby.

442
00:21:18,884 --> 00:21:20,187
I just...

443
00:21:20,783 --> 00:21:22,616
if I could somehow
get through to Teresa,

444
00:21:22,641 --> 00:21:25,342
she might finally have a
say in what happens to her.

445
00:21:25,447 --> 00:21:27,288
I'm sorry, Natalie.

446
00:21:28,024 --> 00:21:30,684
You know what, I want
a neurology consult.

447
00:21:30,686 --> 00:21:32,552
Have Abrams take a look.

448
00:21:34,368 --> 00:21:36,489
Dr. Charles, do you have a minute?

449
00:21:36,491 --> 00:21:37,899
I do.

450
00:21:39,861 --> 00:21:41,961
In order to get a more complete history,

451
00:21:41,963 --> 00:21:43,518
I contacted the officer

452
00:21:43,543 --> 00:21:45,901
who arrested Nancy and her mother.

453
00:21:45,956 --> 00:21:47,057
He sent me his report.

454
00:21:47,082 --> 00:21:49,291
It said they often get
called to Nancy's house

455
00:21:49,316 --> 00:21:51,938
on domestic disputes
involving the mother.

456
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,840
She's been in and out
of jail for assault.

457
00:21:53,842 --> 00:21:55,809
In fact, she is at County right now.

458
00:21:55,811 --> 00:21:57,343
Please take a look.

459
00:21:57,345 --> 00:21:59,646
This could just mean that, you know,

460
00:21:59,648 --> 00:22:01,781
mental illness runs
in... in Nancy's family,

461
00:22:01,783 --> 00:22:04,284
and she and her mom suffer
from the same disorder.

462
00:22:04,286 --> 00:22:05,506
Or it could mean that

463
00:22:05,531 --> 00:22:08,499
Nancy was wrongfully committed
by an unstable mother.

464
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,190
The one thing we know for sure...

465
00:22:10,192 --> 00:22:13,693
it was her mother's testimony
that got Nancy committed,

466
00:22:13,695 --> 00:22:16,730
and her mother's an unreliable witness.

467
00:22:19,534 --> 00:22:21,134
We have a seven-year-old female,

468
00:22:21,136 --> 00:22:23,837
here for reconstruction
of Tetralogy of Fallot.

469
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:26,806
Once we are in the chest and
on bypass, we will relieve

470
00:22:26,808 --> 00:22:29,809
the right ventricular
outflow tract stenosis.

471
00:22:29,811 --> 00:22:31,377
Scalpel?

472
00:22:33,925 --> 00:22:36,316
I want you to observe as I
start at the sternal notch

473
00:22:36,318 --> 00:22:39,357
and cut to the xiphoid.

474
00:22:49,073 --> 00:22:50,506
Dr. Latham?

475
00:22:54,035 --> 00:22:56,269
Dr. Latham, is everything okay?

476
00:22:56,271 --> 00:22:58,538
Yes, yes, Dr. Rhodes.

477
00:23:03,145 --> 00:23:04,878
All right, I got it.

478
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,700
Okay, one left.

479
00:23:08,452 --> 00:23:10,586
She'll be waking soon. Dose
her again with ketamine?

480
00:23:10,611 --> 00:23:12,546
No, let's just finish this.

481
00:23:24,933 --> 00:23:27,267
- Okay.
- Go ahead, Jeff.

482
00:23:29,738 --> 00:23:31,437
Almost there.

483
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,623
All right, I got it.

484
00:23:37,648 --> 00:23:39,419
Okay, pulling it out.

485
00:23:42,915 --> 00:23:44,747
I think it burst in her esophagus.

486
00:23:44,772 --> 00:23:46,917
Give her 20 more of labetalol,
and start an esmolol drip.

487
00:23:46,942 --> 00:23:48,232
Jeff, get the crash cart ready,

488
00:23:48,257 --> 00:23:49,552
- and give me the nitro.
- Got it.

489
00:23:50,897 --> 00:23:52,731
Just lie back. Stay calm.

490
00:23:55,373 --> 00:23:57,206
She's having a
cocaine-induced heart attack.

491
00:23:59,544 --> 00:24:01,544
Giver her two of Versed IV.

492
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,756
Open your mouth, open your mouth.

493
00:24:03,781 --> 00:24:05,599
I'm gonna spray nitroglycerin
under your tongue.

494
00:24:05,624 --> 00:24:06,943
It'll make you feel better.

495
00:24:13,856 --> 00:24:15,819
ST segments are improving.

496
00:24:16,181 --> 00:24:17,915
Does your chest still hurt?

497
00:24:17,937 --> 00:24:19,366
No.

498
00:24:20,202 --> 00:24:23,150
- Sats are good.
- Okay, heart rate, 120s.

499
00:24:23,175 --> 00:24:26,030
She's out and stable.

500
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,928
Okay, what's the call?

501
00:24:31,184 --> 00:24:34,147
We don't have a choice.
We got to report it.

502
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:36,335
Look, this was the only way
she could get her daughter

503
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,100
the operation she needed.

504
00:24:39,826 --> 00:24:42,393
Why can't we destroy
it? Who would that harm?

505
00:24:42,395 --> 00:24:45,162
Smuggling cocaine is a serious crime.

506
00:24:46,122 --> 00:24:48,098
If she made it to her dealers,

507
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:51,379
people would've been
harmed, possibly kids.

508
00:24:51,404 --> 00:24:53,137
She can't just get away with that.

509
00:24:53,139 --> 00:24:55,673
She hasn't. Look at her.

510
00:24:55,675 --> 00:24:57,908
Five minutes ago, her
heart wasn't beating.

511
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,215
- April...
- No.

512
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,956
She wasn't trying to deliver
it. She was trying to flush it.

513
00:25:01,981 --> 00:25:03,347
To destroy evidence.

514
00:25:03,349 --> 00:25:05,790
As of now, it's a victimless crime.

515
00:25:06,209 --> 00:25:08,375
She is a good mother,

516
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,087
who did the only thing she knew how

517
00:25:10,089 --> 00:25:11,751
to help her daughter.

518
00:25:12,158 --> 00:25:14,422
If we destroy this packet,

519
00:25:15,033 --> 00:25:16,770
we'll be committing a crime.

520
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,310
We don't have a choice.

521
00:25:20,335 --> 00:25:21,661
He's right.

522
00:25:24,604 --> 00:25:26,247
Sorry.

523
00:25:34,018 --> 00:25:35,227
- Dr. Manning.
- Yes.

524
00:25:35,252 --> 00:25:37,837
Where are we with Teresa's treatment?

525
00:25:37,862 --> 00:25:39,495
I'd like to run a few more blood tests

526
00:25:39,497 --> 00:25:41,464
to rule out any potential infection,

527
00:25:41,466 --> 00:25:43,599
and I'd also like to look
into physical therapy.

528
00:25:43,601 --> 00:25:46,602
Are there any medical
issues you're still treating?

529
00:25:46,604 --> 00:25:48,404
No, um,

530
00:25:48,406 --> 00:25:50,406
we've treated the vaginal bleeding.

531
00:25:50,408 --> 00:25:52,341
Then it's time to discharge her.

532
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:54,543
Her parents have found
a new care facility,

533
00:25:54,545 --> 00:25:56,612
and they're eager to get
their daughter settled in.

534
00:25:56,614 --> 00:25:58,381
How do we know Teresa will be safe?

535
00:25:58,383 --> 00:26:01,150
How do we know she
won't get abused again?

536
00:26:01,152 --> 00:26:03,619
She has suffered so much. I just...

537
00:26:03,621 --> 00:26:05,354
Just what?

538
00:26:06,956 --> 00:26:08,612
What can you do?

539
00:26:08,781 --> 00:26:10,065
We all wish we could do more,

540
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:11,817
but our job is to treat the ailment

541
00:26:11,842 --> 00:26:13,862
that brought the patient in,

542
00:26:13,887 --> 00:26:15,454
and that's all.

543
00:26:20,953 --> 00:26:23,767
It's time to give her
back to her parents.

544
00:26:26,887 --> 00:26:29,320
We've finished the repair,
and now coming off bypass.

545
00:26:29,345 --> 00:26:30,912
We're off bypass.

546
00:26:30,937 --> 00:26:33,736
At the end of any surgery,
when the patient has been...

547
00:26:33,761 --> 00:26:36,244
Pulmonary artery pressure is 50.

548
00:26:36,877 --> 00:26:39,010
- Coming up to 70.
- And the left ventricular?

549
00:26:39,012 --> 00:26:40,445
100.

550
00:26:40,447 --> 00:26:43,147
Well, let's not get
excited. She'll ride it out.

551
00:26:43,149 --> 00:26:45,234
It's dropping... 80.

552
00:26:45,259 --> 00:26:46,592
Should we put her back on bypass?

553
00:26:46,633 --> 00:26:48,119
Uh... uh, we... we...
I think we should...

554
00:26:48,121 --> 00:26:50,555
- we... we... should, uh...
- She's throwing PVCs.

555
00:26:50,557 --> 00:26:51,856
75.

556
00:26:51,858 --> 00:26:53,531
Pulmonary hypertension's getting worse.

557
00:26:53,556 --> 00:26:54,822
Your graft has to be stenotic.

558
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:56,813
Bypass, Dr. Latham. We
need to fix the graft.

559
00:26:56,863 --> 00:26:59,468
We could try a, uh... uh,
pul-pulmonary vasodilator.

560
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:01,910
Vasodilator's not gonna do it.
We need to open her back up.

561
00:27:01,935 --> 00:27:03,162
Blood pressure's dropping rapidly.

562
00:27:03,187 --> 00:27:04,646
- We're losing her.
- Dr. Latham...

563
00:27:04,671 --> 00:27:07,305
- She's peri-arrest.
- Dr. Latham...

564
00:27:11,414 --> 00:27:13,213
Step away, Dr. Latham.

565
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:15,487
Step away.

566
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:19,261
Marty, re-dose of heparin.
Let's get her back on bypass.

567
00:27:19,286 --> 00:27:21,119
I'm reopening the heart.

568
00:27:36,263 --> 00:27:37,976
There you are.

569
00:27:38,211 --> 00:27:39,544
Hey, how 'bout we, um...

570
00:27:39,546 --> 00:27:41,705
how 'bout we hang out after work?

571
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:44,430
Yeah, maybe go get some of your
favorite fries or something.

572
00:27:44,455 --> 00:27:46,930
Noah, please. I get it, but...

573
00:27:46,955 --> 00:27:49,020
just give me some space, okay?

574
00:27:57,097 --> 00:27:58,663
So I understand that you believe that

575
00:27:58,665 --> 00:28:00,198
you've been wrongfully committed.

576
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,334
Is that right?

577
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:03,467
- Yes, definitely.
- Mm-hmm.

578
00:28:03,492 --> 00:28:06,334
Ever been hospitalized before, Nancy?

579
00:28:06,506 --> 00:28:09,073
Besides for the night my mom
attacked me with a hammer?

580
00:28:09,075 --> 00:28:10,922
- No.
- Huh.

581
00:28:10,947 --> 00:28:13,281
You wanna tell me a
little bit about your mom?

582
00:28:13,306 --> 00:28:15,266
I would. Finally.

583
00:28:15,789 --> 00:28:18,035
Hi, Nancy. How are you?

584
00:28:20,654 --> 00:28:21,853
Okay.

585
00:28:21,855 --> 00:28:23,655
I'm Dr. Baker, Nancy's psychiatrist.

586
00:28:23,657 --> 00:28:25,423
Dan Charles. Nice to meet you.

587
00:28:25,425 --> 00:28:27,659
This is Dr. Halstead, and
I think you know Dr. Reese.

588
00:28:27,661 --> 00:28:30,762
Yes, I'm glad to see our
girl here is in good hands.

589
00:28:30,764 --> 00:28:33,031
- When will she be discharged?
- Oh, she's clear.

590
00:28:33,033 --> 00:28:34,632
We just need to remove the NG tube,

591
00:28:34,634 --> 00:28:36,200
and she'll be ready to go.

592
00:28:36,202 --> 00:28:37,268
Good.

593
00:28:38,672 --> 00:28:40,738
Do you mind? Could I
get a quick word outside?

594
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,435
Of course.

595
00:28:46,146 --> 00:28:47,779
Are you aware that Nancy's mother has

596
00:28:47,781 --> 00:28:49,286
an extensive arrest record?

597
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:50,948
No, I wasn't.

598
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:52,035
Why?

599
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,351
Well, it seems that she
might've been committed

600
00:28:54,354 --> 00:28:57,255
largely based on her
mother's version of events.

601
00:28:57,257 --> 00:28:58,523
Dr. Charles, Nancy was committed

602
00:28:58,525 --> 00:29:00,925
because I deemed her a
threat to herself and others.

603
00:29:00,927 --> 00:29:02,960
I... I was just wondering

604
00:29:02,962 --> 00:29:05,797
if you thought that there
was any chance that, uh,

605
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:08,499
your assessment might've been colored by

606
00:29:08,501 --> 00:29:10,935
a potentially unreliable
history given by the mother.

607
00:29:10,937 --> 00:29:13,237
My assessment was colored
by 20 years of experience

608
00:29:13,239 --> 00:29:14,730
in adolescent psychiatry.

609
00:29:14,755 --> 00:29:17,208
And quite frankly, I don't
appreciate being second-guessed

610
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:19,677
by a doctor who's only known
my patient for one afternoon.

611
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,546
I just saw the potential
for a biased narrative,

612
00:29:21,548 --> 00:29:23,581
and I wanted to make sure
you had all the facts.

613
00:29:23,583 --> 00:29:25,249
A biased narrative.

614
00:29:25,251 --> 00:29:26,984
As Nancy's court-appointed doctor,

615
00:29:26,986 --> 00:29:30,071
I'd advise you to worry about
your own patients, Dr. Charles.

616
00:29:33,426 --> 00:29:36,330
Hey, are you discharging her?

617
00:29:36,496 --> 00:29:38,696
I just finished the paperwork now.

618
00:29:42,669 --> 00:29:44,822
- Dr. Manning.
- Yes.

619
00:29:45,004 --> 00:29:47,537
Your coma patient... given the...

620
00:29:47,709 --> 00:29:50,209
abysmal treatment she
received at that facility,

621
00:29:50,234 --> 00:29:51,834
I couldn't help but
wonder what other ways

622
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:53,388
they might've failed her,

623
00:29:53,413 --> 00:29:55,980
- so I reviewed her history.
- Did you find anything?

624
00:29:55,982 --> 00:29:57,882
I'm afraid not, but I
do have one question.

625
00:29:57,884 --> 00:30:00,551
What time of day did you
perform that neuro exam?

626
00:30:00,553 --> 00:30:02,006
Morning. Why?

627
00:30:02,031 --> 00:30:04,222
Well, sometimes,
traumatic brain injuries

628
00:30:04,224 --> 00:30:05,556
result in a patient developing

629
00:30:05,558 --> 00:30:07,592
irregular sleep/wake circadian cycles,

630
00:30:07,594 --> 00:30:10,714
so it's possible
Teresa's become nocturnal.

631
00:30:10,739 --> 00:30:12,511
I suggest we try that test again.

632
00:30:12,536 --> 00:30:13,968
Great.

633
00:30:15,702 --> 00:30:17,422
Mr. and Mrs. Azen...

634
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:20,071
this is Dr. Abrams,
Chief of Neurosurgery.

635
00:30:20,073 --> 00:30:23,218
Do you mind if we perform one
more test on your daughter?

636
00:30:23,343 --> 00:30:25,878
Well, the EMTs from her new
facility are on their way.

637
00:30:25,903 --> 00:30:27,804
It should just take a moment.

638
00:30:31,581 --> 00:30:35,398
Teresa, if you can hear
me, please open your eyes.

639
00:30:38,525 --> 00:30:40,291
I've asked her that a million times.

640
00:30:40,293 --> 00:30:43,127
I know. Just bear with me a moment.

641
00:30:44,864 --> 00:30:47,098
Teresa, if you can hear me,

642
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,116
please move your eyes side to side.

643
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,091
I'm sorry.

644
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:57,275
I finished Teresa's discharge.

645
00:30:57,277 --> 00:30:58,755
As soon as her transportation arrives...

646
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,079
Hold on.

647
00:31:00,104 --> 00:31:02,474
There's a condition called

648
00:31:02,499 --> 00:31:04,247
locked-in syndrome.

649
00:31:04,417 --> 00:31:06,384
If your daughter has
it, she'd be conscious,

650
00:31:06,386 --> 00:31:09,020
but she wouldn't be able to
move her eyes side to side.

651
00:31:09,045 --> 00:31:11,122
She could, however, move them...

652
00:31:11,424 --> 00:31:12,957
well, let's see.

653
00:31:14,594 --> 00:31:16,119
Teresa...

654
00:31:16,144 --> 00:31:18,773
I need you to move your eyes
up and down for me, please.

655
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:20,398
Up and down.

656
00:31:22,068 --> 00:31:23,691
Did you see that?

657
00:31:23,716 --> 00:31:25,473
What was that?

658
00:31:26,105 --> 00:31:28,039
Teresa, if you can hear me,

659
00:31:28,041 --> 00:31:31,442
please move your eyes up and down again.

660
00:31:37,383 --> 00:31:38,850
Oh, my God.

661
00:31:49,786 --> 00:31:51,053
I don't understand.

662
00:31:51,055 --> 00:31:53,298
How did you wake her from the coma?

663
00:31:53,323 --> 00:31:54,589
I didn't.

664
00:31:54,614 --> 00:31:57,426
Uh, I don't believe
she ever was in a coma.

665
00:31:57,451 --> 00:31:58,838
What?

666
00:31:58,863 --> 00:32:00,497
We need more tests to be certain,

667
00:32:00,522 --> 00:32:03,252
but it's my opinion
that her accident caused

668
00:32:03,277 --> 00:32:04,668
a stroke to the brain stem,

669
00:32:04,693 --> 00:32:06,426
which included the basilar artery.

670
00:32:06,428 --> 00:32:07,660
What does that mean?

671
00:32:07,662 --> 00:32:09,963
The stroke left her
completely paralyzed,

672
00:32:09,965 --> 00:32:11,397
but still conscious.

673
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:13,032
Locked-in syndrome...

674
00:32:13,034 --> 00:32:14,923
she's awake,

675
00:32:14,948 --> 00:32:17,126
but locked in her body.

676
00:32:17,639 --> 00:32:19,915
All these years?

677
00:32:20,509 --> 00:32:23,424
She's always been awake?

678
00:32:23,979 --> 00:32:25,479
Yes.

679
00:32:25,814 --> 00:32:28,745
She heard everything we said...

680
00:32:30,018 --> 00:32:31,718
I said.

681
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,721
And she was conscious...

682
00:32:33,922 --> 00:32:36,890
while some monster assaulted her?

683
00:32:36,892 --> 00:32:39,392
Oh, my poor baby.

684
00:32:41,029 --> 00:32:44,297
I know, it's so terrible. I'm so sorry.

685
00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:46,331
But at least you haven't lost her.

686
00:32:47,202 --> 00:32:49,425
It's possible

687
00:32:49,571 --> 00:32:53,039
that some of her paralysis
is the result of spasticity,

688
00:32:53,041 --> 00:32:55,074
and it's therefore treatable

689
00:32:55,076 --> 00:32:57,310
with muscle relaxants
and physical therapy.

690
00:32:57,312 --> 00:32:59,373
Wait, will she get better?

691
00:32:59,581 --> 00:33:01,014
She'll never be fully functional,

692
00:33:01,016 --> 00:33:03,724
but she should regain some movement.

693
00:33:04,419 --> 00:33:07,644
We can also order an
infrared eye-tracking device

694
00:33:07,669 --> 00:33:10,295
that'll allow Teresa to
communicate through a computer.

695
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,240
- Communicate?
- Yeah.

696
00:33:12,265 --> 00:33:14,460
And she'll be able to put
together words and sentences.

697
00:33:14,462 --> 00:33:16,095
You'll be able to have a conversation

698
00:33:16,097 --> 00:33:18,052
with your daughter again.

699
00:33:18,266 --> 00:33:20,373
A conversation?

700
00:33:21,752 --> 00:33:23,752
With my little girl?

701
00:33:23,872 --> 00:33:25,638
Thank you.

702
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,154
We'll give you time alone
with your daughter now.

703
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,563
Thank you.

704
00:33:39,719 --> 00:33:41,329
Sarah?

705
00:33:41,354 --> 00:33:43,056
Th-they're telling me to get dressed.

706
00:33:43,058 --> 00:33:45,491
- They're sending me back.
- I know. I'm sorry.

707
00:33:45,493 --> 00:33:47,743
Sarah, please,

708
00:33:47,878 --> 00:33:50,538
- help me.
- I tried. I did,

709
00:33:50,563 --> 00:33:53,257
but Dr. Baker has
conservatorship over you.

710
00:33:53,282 --> 00:33:54,548
According to the courts,

711
00:33:54,573 --> 00:33:56,563
she has to be the one
to change the diagnosis,

712
00:33:56,588 --> 00:33:58,242
and we couldn't change her mind.

713
00:34:00,112 --> 00:34:03,213
Hey, I'm not giving up,

714
00:34:03,215 --> 00:34:05,938
and you can't either. Stay strong.

715
00:34:05,963 --> 00:34:08,196
We'll figure something else out.

716
00:34:09,288 --> 00:34:10,829
Okay?

717
00:34:16,309 --> 00:34:17,709
Give me a second.

718
00:34:19,987 --> 00:34:22,766
Dr. Charles, I know I don't
have any definitive proof,

719
00:34:22,768 --> 00:34:24,067
but she is sane. I know it.

720
00:34:24,069 --> 00:34:25,636
- We can't let her go back.
- Slow down, Dr. Reese.

721
00:34:25,638 --> 00:34:27,631
Dr. Baker just doesn't want to admit

722
00:34:27,656 --> 00:34:28,997
that she misdiagnosed her.

723
00:34:29,022 --> 00:34:31,089
You know what, I happen
to agree with you.

724
00:34:31,114 --> 00:34:32,376
I'm filing an appeal.

725
00:34:32,378 --> 00:34:34,244
You... you don't think
she's mentally ill?

726
00:34:34,246 --> 00:34:36,146
Can't be positive, but either way,

727
00:34:36,148 --> 00:34:38,115
she should not be locked
up on a long-term hold

728
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:40,263
based solely on her mother's testimony.

729
00:34:40,288 --> 00:34:42,408
- Need some help!
- Treatment 1.

730
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:48,088
- What happened?
- Give me some pressure.

731
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:49,930
Must've grabbed the
scalpel from the cart.

732
00:34:49,955 --> 00:34:52,078
Tourniquet her arm,
and give me a hemostat.

733
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:56,235
- It's tied.
- I-I'm not crazy, Sarah.

734
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,594
I-I'm not.

735
00:35:17,223 --> 00:35:19,314
Surgery turned out well today.

736
00:35:19,339 --> 00:35:21,272
Thanks to you, Dr. Rhodes.

737
00:35:23,474 --> 00:35:24,739
It's been a long day, Dr. Latham.

738
00:35:24,764 --> 00:35:26,200
How 'bout a drink?

739
00:35:33,684 --> 00:35:35,644
Señorita Cespedes...

740
00:35:41,833 --> 00:35:43,403
Gracias.

741
00:35:46,403 --> 00:35:48,332
We need to talk to Goodwin.

742
00:35:55,311 --> 00:35:59,324
Trafficking of cocaine is a felony.

743
00:35:59,482 --> 00:36:03,351
That means calling the DEA, Homeland,

744
00:36:03,353 --> 00:36:04,652
the whole nine yards.

745
00:36:04,677 --> 00:36:07,136
All that over one packet?

746
00:36:07,324 --> 00:36:10,613
Well, if the evidence is just this one,

747
00:36:10,638 --> 00:36:14,925
that doesn't demonstrate
intent to traffic and sell.

748
00:36:16,533 --> 00:36:17,999
Were there more?

749
00:36:19,702 --> 00:36:20,972
No.

750
00:36:21,705 --> 00:36:23,871
The one packet is all we found.

751
00:36:25,675 --> 00:36:27,203
That's correct.

752
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:31,109
Dr. Choi?

753
00:36:32,415 --> 00:36:34,234
Anything to add?

754
00:36:36,219 --> 00:36:38,085
Dr. Choi...

755
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:44,091
No.

756
00:36:47,964 --> 00:36:49,684
Then that's that.

757
00:37:02,812 --> 00:37:04,512
Thank you, Dr. Choi.

758
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,390
Do not put me in that position again...

759
00:37:09,419 --> 00:37:11,018
either of you.

760
00:37:15,759 --> 00:37:18,073
I don't know that I helped Zulmera.

761
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:21,229
She still has to deal with the
people whose drugs she lost.

762
00:37:21,231 --> 00:37:23,397
Ah, she is a resourceful woman.

763
00:37:23,399 --> 00:37:25,766
- She's gonna do what she needs
- to take care of that little girl.

764
00:37:25,768 --> 00:37:28,197
I had to at least try to help her.

765
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:31,369
If I had a child, I
would've done the same thing.

766
00:37:32,008 --> 00:37:33,369
I know.

767
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:36,572
Thank you.

768
00:37:37,709 --> 00:37:39,872
And thank you for earlier...

769
00:37:40,617 --> 00:37:42,416
about the baby.

770
00:37:49,859 --> 00:37:51,455
It's my fault.

771
00:37:52,245 --> 00:37:53,978
Why'd you say that?

772
00:37:54,003 --> 00:37:56,049
I gave her false hope.

773
00:37:56,432 --> 00:37:59,206
I told her I believed she was
stable when she clearly isn't.

774
00:37:59,231 --> 00:38:01,602
Uh, I'm not sure I agree.

775
00:38:01,604 --> 00:38:04,972
I mean, just made her
case a little tougher,

776
00:38:04,974 --> 00:38:07,041
but I'm still gonna file the appeal.

777
00:38:08,193 --> 00:38:09,325
Why would you do that

778
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:11,384
when she just tried to kill herself?

779
00:38:11,409 --> 00:38:14,376
Losing hope is not a
sign of mental illness.

780
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:16,317
It's a sign of being human.

781
00:38:16,319 --> 00:38:19,353
I mean, the poor girl... she
has a violent, unstable mother,

782
00:38:19,355 --> 00:38:21,322
and her fate is in the
hands of this psychiatrist

783
00:38:21,324 --> 00:38:23,369
who doesn't believe a word she says.

784
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,927
I mean, given those odds,
I can absolutely understand

785
00:38:25,952 --> 00:38:27,939
why she'd fall into despair.

786
00:38:48,818 --> 00:38:51,218
Had to prove me wrong, didn't ya?

787
00:38:56,158 --> 00:38:58,332
Looks like you're gonna get your wish.

788
00:38:58,739 --> 00:39:00,956
She will have a say in her future.

789
00:39:08,452 --> 00:39:11,520
Dr. Latham, you decide
on that drink after all?

790
00:39:14,928 --> 00:39:17,723
Maimonides... 12th century
rabbi and physician.

791
00:39:17,748 --> 00:39:21,106
He said that the risk
of a wrong decision

792
00:39:21,131 --> 00:39:23,951
is preferable to the
terror of indecision.

793
00:39:25,234 --> 00:39:26,934
I have never had a moment like today

794
00:39:26,959 --> 00:39:29,093
before I started my TMS treatments.

795
00:39:29,095 --> 00:39:31,695
I wouldn't worry. I
doubt it'll happen again.

796
00:39:31,697 --> 00:39:32,740
Hm.

797
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,966
That girl was more than
just a surgical challenge.

798
00:39:35,968 --> 00:39:38,990
She became a human being to me.

799
00:39:39,205 --> 00:39:41,006
I lost my detachment.

800
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:43,100
I cannot afford that.

801
00:39:43,809 --> 00:39:46,576
I'm ending my treatments,
at least for the time being.

802
00:39:48,547 --> 00:39:51,045
Well, I'm sorry that you feel like
you have to make that decision,

803
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:52,880
but I trust your judgement.

804
00:39:53,319 --> 00:39:54,685
Hm.

805
00:39:56,922 --> 00:39:58,355
When you started your fellowship,

806
00:39:58,357 --> 00:40:01,177
I told you that you
were not my first choice.

807
00:40:03,396 --> 00:40:05,295
After working with
you these last months,

808
00:40:05,297 --> 00:40:07,698
I would like to say
that I cannot imagine

809
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:11,727
a finer surgeon or person
than you, Dr. Rhodes.

810
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,406
Thank you.

811
00:40:17,974 --> 00:40:20,992
- Well, let's leave it at that.
- Yeah.

812
00:40:21,557 --> 00:40:23,587
I would like a drink.

813
00:40:23,612 --> 00:40:26,078
Scotch for me... neat.

814
00:40:26,285 --> 00:40:28,985
And another for my friend.

815
00:40:52,278 --> 00:40:53,688
Hey.

816
00:40:54,513 --> 00:40:56,516
Look, I'm... I'm sorry.

817
00:40:56,615 --> 00:40:59,743
Okay, I... I... I
don't know what to say.

818
00:40:59,768 --> 00:41:02,696
I got no clue what you're going through,

819
00:41:03,089 --> 00:41:04,806
but I wish I could help.
