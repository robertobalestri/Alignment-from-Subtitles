1
00:00:02,309 --> 00:00:04,938
E.R.

2
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:06,455
Previously on E. R.

3
00:00:06,456 --> 00:00:07,646
What are you doing?

4
00:00:07,647 --> 00:00:11,321
I think the grease from the meat dripped
on the coals and caught on fire.

5
00:00:11,356 --> 00:00:14,229
- Yeah, that's what the water's bottle's for.
- You didn't tell me that. 

6
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:19,981
And I'm not going to be doing my dying in your
cramped, thin-walled second floor walkup.

7
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:24,739
If anybody starts asking questions,
don't expect me to lie for you.

8
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,540
Is there anything else you wanna tell me, Carter?

9
00:00:26,575 --> 00:00:27,952
I made a mistake. I'm sorry.

10
00:00:27,953 --> 00:00:30,915
Then you're suspended.
Sign out the patients and go home.

11
00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:33,928
- Robert, let's not-
- Right now, Kerry. Right now.

12
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:39,014
E. R. 6x18 "MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN"

13
00:00:42,607 --> 00:00:44,730
Luka! What is that,
Croatian for "lucky"?

14
00:00:44,942 --> 00:00:46,271
No, Luke.

15
00:00:46,444 --> 00:00:48,021
- You sure?
- Yeah.

16
00:00:48,195 --> 00:00:52,275
- What's the matter? You're dragging.
- I worked four shifts in three days.

17
00:00:52,491 --> 00:00:56,903
We are 200 charts behind in coding.
I haven't done one QA.

18
00:00:57,078 --> 00:01:01,206
Pull yourself together. Prove your mettle
and I'll anoint you temporary chief.

19
00:01:01,415 --> 00:01:05,827
Or not. There's a hole in the schedule.
I gave you the midnight shift.

20
00:01:06,044 --> 00:01:08,286
- Tonight?
- Or tomorrow morning.

21
00:01:08,505 --> 00:01:11,209
- I'm not doing this.
- Luka, listen to me.

22
00:01:11,382 --> 00:01:14,087
This is important.
No truer words have ever been spoken.

23
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,545
The last four letters in "American"
are "I can."

24
00:01:18,138 --> 00:01:19,549
Put it another way.

25
00:01:19,764 --> 00:01:22,967
Cover this and I'll owe you.
Don't, and you're fired.

26
00:01:23,184 --> 00:01:26,138
- When is Kerry coming back?
- Who says she is?

27
00:01:27,813 --> 00:01:31,098
- I'm running across the street-
- Get me a doughnut?

28
00:01:31,275 --> 00:01:34,857
Sixteen-year-old driver, MVA,
crashed into a guardrail.

29
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,612
- Need help?
- I've got it.

30
00:01:36,779 --> 00:01:38,653
- And the car?
- It's still there.

31
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:40,773
- They'll take it away, right?
- We'll see.

32
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,029
BP is 130/85. Pulse 110.
Complains of abdominal pain.

33
00:01:46,204 --> 00:01:47,912
- Do you have neck pain?
- No.

34
00:01:48,123 --> 00:01:50,448
I'll take this off. Don't move.

35
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:53,620
I've had my license two weeks.
This is the first time he let me drive it.

36
00:01:53,794 --> 00:01:55,122
- Any pain here?
- No.

37
00:01:55,296 --> 00:01:57,418
- Look at me. Look at the nurse.
- I'm okay.

38
00:01:57,589 --> 00:01:59,997
- Can I use the phone?
- Soon as the doctor's done.

39
00:02:00,175 --> 00:02:04,006
Neck is clear. Roll away from me.
We'll get you off this board.

40
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,304
- Pulse ox 99.
- Did the airbag deploy?

41
00:02:07,473 --> 00:02:10,142
It's a '65 Mustang,
no airbag, just has a seat belt.

42
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:12,597
- No shoulder strap?
- No. He'll kill me.

43
00:02:12,811 --> 00:02:15,847
I'm sure your father
is more concerned about you.

44
00:02:16,064 --> 00:02:20,974
- You don't know my father.
- Chest is clear. Does this hurt?

45
00:02:21,152 --> 00:02:24,187
- Here?
- I think the belt caught me there.

46
00:02:24,404 --> 00:02:28,781
It's a good thing you were wearing it.
CBC, chest x-ray...

47
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,862
...abdominal CT
and a surgical consult.

48
00:02:32,078 --> 00:02:34,948
- Hit the brakes. I can't believe this.
- Insurance will pay.

49
00:02:35,164 --> 00:02:37,999
- They can't fix a classic.
- They can.

50
00:02:38,834 --> 00:02:42,997
Eli, look at me.
We call them accidents for a reason.

51
00:02:43,171 --> 00:02:45,922
You might think this is a big deal,
but it'll be okay.

52
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:47,507
Really.

53
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:52,509
Can I get some extra napkins
and more water, please?

54
00:02:53,221 --> 00:02:57,053
- Morning, ladies.
- No offense, but you look like hell.

55
00:02:57,266 --> 00:03:00,053
If you haven't noticed, we're short.

56
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:03,186
- Yeah, it's been pretty quiet.
- For you maybe.

57
00:03:03,355 --> 00:03:07,020
- Come on, Kate. You gotta finish.
- So you got them into daycare?

58
00:03:07,567 --> 00:03:10,521
Yeah. They usually
don't take them this early.

59
00:03:10,695 --> 00:03:12,853
They're just advanced
for their age.

60
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:17,158
I couldn't afford a nanny anymore.
Sweetie? A couple bites.

61
00:03:17,367 --> 00:03:19,407
- I don't blame her.
- What?

62
00:03:19,578 --> 00:03:21,985
- What is that?
- Rice cereal. She likes it.

63
00:03:22,205 --> 00:03:25,905
- Yeah, I can see.
- She's mad because I fed Tess first.

64
00:03:26,167 --> 00:03:29,582
- Come on, Kate, we're gonna be late.
- Here, let me try.

65
00:03:29,795 --> 00:03:32,416
Good luck.
This one's gonna give me gray hair.

66
00:03:32,631 --> 00:03:35,121
- Just wait till she's 14.
- Oh, yeah.

67
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:38,377
- Oh, how gorgeous!
- Oh, thank you.

68
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:40,053
- Girls?
- Yeah.

69
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:43,049
Oh, they look like angels.

70
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:45,388
Yeah, looks can be deceiving.

71
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,262
I don't believe that. No, I don't.

72
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:55,433
You don't give your mommy and daddy
any trouble, do you? Beautiful family.

73
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,775
- Yes, it is. Aidan, please.
- Quit it.

74
00:04:53,952 --> 00:04:56,739
- He pushed me.
- Wyatt, stop. Wyatt!

75
00:04:56,954 --> 00:04:59,706
Wait. Are these all your children?

76
00:04:59,915 --> 00:05:01,374
- Yes.
- No wonder you collapsed.

77
00:05:01,542 --> 00:05:04,542
BP's a little low at 95/70,
tachy at 120.

78
00:05:04,753 --> 00:05:08,584
- Wyatt, come here!
- A candy bar's stuck. I can get it.

79
00:05:08,756 --> 00:05:10,583
- Come here.
- Babysitting?

80
00:05:10,758 --> 00:05:13,379
LOC at a grocery store.
Couldn't leave them.

81
00:05:13,928 --> 00:05:15,303
Here, try this.

82
00:05:15,512 --> 00:05:17,339
- Say thank you, Wyatt.
- Thanks.

83
00:05:17,514 --> 00:05:21,463
- You're welcome. Where we going?
- Exam 2. Abrasion to the temple.

84
00:05:21,684 --> 00:05:24,092
- I think I hit my head on a shelf.
- Mommy, mommy.

85
00:05:24,312 --> 00:05:26,185
- Have you fainted before?
- No.

86
00:05:26,397 --> 00:05:31,023
- I was feeling dizzy. I'm just tired.
- She vomited and has double vision.

87
00:05:31,234 --> 00:05:32,776
Mouth and lips are dry.

88
00:05:32,986 --> 00:05:36,022
- Is that bad?
- Probably just dehydration.

89
00:05:37,281 --> 00:05:41,610
- I think his diaper's leaking.
- I'm sorry. He pulls at it sometimes.

90
00:05:41,785 --> 00:05:44,241
- I got two.
- You have to share.

91
00:05:44,454 --> 00:05:46,826
- These are mine.
- Share it with him.

92
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,412
Your dad's nurse is on the phone.

93
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:52,081
- Okay. You got this?
- I think so.

94
00:05:52,294 --> 00:05:54,038
- Here. You wanna get down?
- Yeah.

95
00:05:54,213 --> 00:05:58,376
- Tech support was gonna fix this.
- I paged them twice.

96
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:00,501
- Which line?
- Two.

97
00:06:00,718 --> 00:06:04,585
- I can't get labs.
- Usually Dr. Weaver yells at them.

98
00:06:04,805 --> 00:06:06,714
Don't worry about what he says.

99
00:06:06,932 --> 00:06:09,174
Mark, do you know where
the extra T-sheets are?

100
00:06:09,351 --> 00:06:11,723
There's no abdominal pain
or shortness of breath.

101
00:06:11,895 --> 00:06:13,223
It's Kerry's system.

102
00:06:13,396 --> 00:06:19,019
- How long's the suspension gonna last?
- Grab a general adult form.

103
00:06:19,193 --> 00:06:21,766
Listen, I understand that, of course.

104
00:06:21,987 --> 00:06:25,153
No one is questioning
your qualifications.

105
00:06:25,323 --> 00:06:27,648
He is? Let me speak to him.

106
00:06:27,826 --> 00:06:30,696
- Call for surgical consult?
- Trauma Two.

107
00:06:30,912 --> 00:06:35,952
Tell him I wanna speak to him.
Tell him that I said to knock it off.

108
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:39,785
I'm sorry, Mrs. Fredriksson.
Just bear with me, okay?

109
00:06:40,003 --> 00:06:44,498
I'll be home tonight and we'll
straighten this out. Thank you.

110
00:06:44,674 --> 00:06:46,333
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, fine.

111
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:51,384
- We're out of the general forms.
- Go back to the old charts.

112
00:06:51,596 --> 00:06:55,012
Do we have a forwarding
address for Lucy?

113
00:06:55,183 --> 00:06:58,100
- She got something?
- The Matching Program.

114
00:06:58,311 --> 00:07:00,350
They forgot to pull her application.

115
00:07:00,562 --> 00:07:03,598
Yeah, so some hospital thinks
she'll work for them next year.

116
00:07:03,815 --> 00:07:06,686
- Call them.
- Should we send it to her mom?

117
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,646
- I don't know.
- What should I do with it?

118
00:07:09,821 --> 00:07:12,146
- I'll take care of it.
- Carter, are you sure-?

119
00:07:12,364 --> 00:07:14,855
- No, I got it.
- All right.

120
00:07:21,331 --> 00:07:22,659
He's so cute.

121
00:07:22,832 --> 00:07:25,667
- I can do that. You don't have to.
- It's not a problem.

122
00:07:25,876 --> 00:07:29,327
I feel a lot better already.
Ian, put that down.

123
00:07:29,546 --> 00:07:34,706
- Come here, please. I said, come here.
- Four kids under 8. That's ambitious.

124
00:07:34,926 --> 00:07:36,965
Five, the baby's home.

125
00:07:37,136 --> 00:07:40,256
I asked you to please stop, didn't I?
Stop that.

126
00:07:40,472 --> 00:07:44,683
You're just exhausted.
But we're still gonna do a head CT.

127
00:07:44,851 --> 00:07:48,302
- That's enough.
- And I'm giving you some saline.

128
00:07:48,521 --> 00:07:51,605
- What's a CT?
- It's a picture of your brain.

129
00:07:51,816 --> 00:07:55,184
A volunteer down in Pedes
agreed to watch the kids.

130
00:07:55,402 --> 00:07:57,691
- I don't wanna be any trouble.
- It's no trouble.

131
00:07:57,863 --> 00:07:59,191
You kids wanna go play?

132
00:07:59,406 --> 00:08:01,813
- No.
- We've got Nintendo.

133
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:03,361
"Super Smash Bros. "?

134
00:08:03,576 --> 00:08:06,742
I don't know.
They got something with a gorilla.

135
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:09,705
- Wyatt, hold Emily's hand.
- Okay.

136
00:08:09,915 --> 00:08:11,706
- Follow your brother.
- Bye.

137
00:08:11,917 --> 00:08:14,288
Okay, guitar. I need the guitar.

138
00:08:14,502 --> 00:08:18,630
- Thank you.
- We're gonna have a lot of fun.

139
00:08:20,257 --> 00:08:22,546
Okay, here you go.

140
00:08:23,343 --> 00:08:24,921
Let's go.

141
00:08:26,513 --> 00:08:30,012
- How do you do it?
- One day at a time.

142
00:08:30,183 --> 00:08:32,969
- Good bowel sounds. Any nausea?
- No.

143
00:08:33,686 --> 00:08:37,268
- There's no guarding or rebound.
- There was before.

144
00:08:37,439 --> 00:08:38,933
Eli, what happened?

145
00:08:39,482 --> 00:08:41,190
- I had an accident.
- With the car?

146
00:08:41,401 --> 00:08:43,393
- I lost control-
- How fast were you going?

147
00:08:43,569 --> 00:08:45,941
- I don't know!
- It's okay. Don't worry about it.

148
00:08:46,155 --> 00:08:47,697
- The car is bad.
- No big deal.

149
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:51,200
- I'm Dr. Finch.
- What's wrong with him?

150
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:55,027
We may need to perform exploratory
surgery to rule out internal injury.

151
00:08:55,246 --> 00:08:57,369
- Oh, God...
- That's not necessary.

152
00:08:57,581 --> 00:09:00,072
- You don't know?
- We'll observe him.

153
00:09:00,292 --> 00:09:03,044
Let's keep him NPO
and check his CBC every six hours.

154
00:09:03,253 --> 00:09:06,419
- Sure. You have a minute?
- Yep.

155
00:09:08,174 --> 00:09:10,925
I'll do whatever it takes to replace it.
I promise.

156
00:09:11,135 --> 00:09:14,420
I don't care about the car.
I can get another.

157
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:19,927
- He has a lap belt injury.
- Let's wait on the CT.

158
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:24,389
CT is only 20 percent sensitive.
You should explore him.

159
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,644
- No peritoneal signs.
- He did.

160
00:09:26,815 --> 00:09:30,860
You asked for a surgical opinion.
I've given you one.

161
00:09:31,069 --> 00:09:32,978
Let me know what the CT shows.

162
00:09:33,196 --> 00:09:36,031
- ICON is positive. She's pregnant.
- The woman with the kids?

163
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,534
Yeah, eight weeks.
There's ketones in her urine.

164
00:09:40,744 --> 00:09:43,828
No time to eat.
I guess this wasn't planned.

165
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:45,830
Maybe she wants a softball team.

166
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,710
- She already go to CT?
- Five minutes ago.

167
00:09:48,876 --> 00:09:52,576
Call Radiology and talk to her
about her diet.

168
00:09:52,796 --> 00:09:55,334
Carol, do we have
any Materna vitamins?

169
00:09:55,549 --> 00:09:59,416
Try drug lockup.
Can you sign for central-line kits?

170
00:09:59,636 --> 00:10:01,545
- Sure. Where?
- Right there.

171
00:10:01,721 --> 00:10:04,675
Now sign out three cases
and put two and initial.

172
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:07,381
It's a game I play.
I need two, so I ask for three.

173
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:11,224
- So every time-
- Don't ask, Mark. I get what I need.

174
00:10:11,438 --> 00:10:12,896
Okay, whatever it takes.

175
00:10:13,106 --> 00:10:15,893
Thanks. Maybe I'll have you sign off
on crash carts too.

176
00:10:16,067 --> 00:10:17,940
Bring it on. I'm easy.

177
00:10:19,695 --> 00:10:23,443
Hey, Carol.
Can you give a dose of Levaquin?

178
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:26,942
- Sure.
- Did the girls settle in?

179
00:10:27,118 --> 00:10:29,739
- They seem to like it?
- I don't know. They're babies.

180
00:10:29,954 --> 00:10:34,081
I'd worry about the staff.
"The Hathaway twins hit daycare. "

181
00:10:34,249 --> 00:10:38,199
- Ross. Their last name is Ross.
- Right.

182
00:10:39,462 --> 00:10:42,997
- Sorry.
- No, don't worry. They're fine.

183
00:10:43,174 --> 00:10:46,589
Good. Good.
And run in a liter of saline.

184
00:10:46,802 --> 00:10:48,510
Okay.

185
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,763
- Mr. Simpson?
- Yes.

186
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:56,887
Dr. Kovac.
You experience some chest pain?

187
00:10:57,103 --> 00:10:59,428
It's not really pain. It feels tight.

188
00:10:59,605 --> 00:11:02,226
- How long does it last?
- Few seconds.

189
00:11:02,441 --> 00:11:04,896
I think I'm having anxiety attacks.

190
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,683
I can't breathe,
my heart starts pounding.

191
00:11:07,904 --> 00:11:10,359
- History of heart disease?
- No.

192
00:11:10,573 --> 00:11:14,985
- What brings it on?
- I'm going through a bad divorce.

193
00:11:15,827 --> 00:11:18,863
I see. Does the pain move
anywhere else?

194
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,119
I got aches and pains all over.

195
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:25,453
She gets up every morning thinking
how she can screw with me.

196
00:11:25,628 --> 00:11:29,956
Okay, let's get a 12-lead EKG
and draw cardiac labs.

197
00:11:30,132 --> 00:11:32,966
- You married, doc?
- No.

198
00:11:33,134 --> 00:11:37,001
Stay that way.
It's not enough she bankrupts me...

199
00:11:37,221 --> 00:11:40,305
- ... she's putting me in the grave.
- We'll see what we can do.

200
00:11:40,516 --> 00:11:42,259
Yeah.

201
00:11:42,476 --> 00:11:44,018
Yeah.

202
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,848
There.

203
00:11:49,023 --> 00:11:50,850
Looks like a good heartbeat.

204
00:11:52,484 --> 00:11:57,774
By the time one gets to sleep,
another one's hungry or needs changing.

205
00:11:57,989 --> 00:12:01,239
Or somebody's into something
he shouldn't be.

206
00:12:01,743 --> 00:12:03,071
Do you have any help?

207
00:12:03,286 --> 00:12:07,413
My husband works a lot.
You should see our grocery bill.

208
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:12,375
Well, you have to take
better care of yourself.

209
00:12:12,585 --> 00:12:17,496
You're malnourished.
You have to eat more and take vitamins.

210
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,922
Did you know you were pregnant?

211
00:12:27,098 --> 00:12:29,304
How long have you known?

212
00:12:29,809 --> 00:12:31,267
I don't know.

213
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:37,977
Have you told your husband?

214
00:12:38,733 --> 00:12:40,061
No.

215
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:49,690
- And you were fasting?
- No! I don't have time to eat.

216
00:12:49,868 --> 00:12:54,446
You weren't starving yourself
to induce a miscarriage, were you?

217
00:12:57,041 --> 00:13:01,667
We both wanted a big family.
I just thought I'd get a break.

218
00:13:02,462 --> 00:13:04,502
Your body protects the fetus first.

219
00:13:04,714 --> 00:13:08,628
But you're putting your
own heart and kidneys at risk.

220
00:13:14,223 --> 00:13:16,215
Were you trying to terminate?

221
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:25,187
There are safer ways to do that.

222
00:13:29,486 --> 00:13:31,727
Have you considered an abortion?

223
00:13:32,906 --> 00:13:36,155
I can't have another baby right now.
I just can't.

224
00:13:42,914 --> 00:13:46,698
- Another Webril.
- Poor guy slips, breaks his neck.

225
00:13:46,918 --> 00:13:50,286
This woman falls down concrete steps
and cracks her wrist.

226
00:13:50,504 --> 00:13:53,209
The benefits of alcohol consumption.

227
00:13:53,424 --> 00:13:55,332
I could do with a margarita.

228
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:58,670
I don't remember the last time
I had a drink.

229
00:13:58,887 --> 00:14:02,754
It's the "no caffeine"
I couldn't deal with.

230
00:14:02,974 --> 00:14:06,805
- Thanks, Mark.
- Three-inch roll.

231
00:14:07,477 --> 00:14:09,351
I'm thinking of weaning them.

232
00:14:09,521 --> 00:14:13,055
It's been six months. I don't know
how much longer I can deal.

233
00:14:13,274 --> 00:14:17,437
- I can't believe you've lasted this long.
- So I'm not a terrible mother?

234
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:22,442
If you planned on being
the perfect parent, fail now...

235
00:14:22,657 --> 00:14:24,531
...while they can't remember.

236
00:14:25,452 --> 00:14:27,408
Another three-inch.

237
00:14:30,122 --> 00:14:32,079
You okay?

238
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:38,329
- They deserve a father, Mark.
- Doug's been seeing them.

239
00:14:39,964 --> 00:14:45,836
He asked me to move to Seattle again.
And I think he's serious this time.

240
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:48,920
What did you tell him?

241
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:53,974
- Do you have a second?
- Go ahead. I got this.

242
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:55,893
Okay.

243
00:14:59,314 --> 00:15:02,730
- What's up?
- She was starving herself to miscarry.

244
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:05,979
- "Supermom"?
- I may have talked her into an abortion.

245
00:15:06,195 --> 00:15:09,231
- She didn't ask for one?
- She's scared.

246
00:15:09,448 --> 00:15:11,156
Come here.

247
00:15:12,117 --> 00:15:16,992
- She doesn't want her husband to know.
- Refer her to the GYN clinic.

248
00:15:17,205 --> 00:15:21,665
I offered to arrange things
for her upstairs. Today.

249
00:15:21,834 --> 00:15:25,831
- What's the rush?
- This might be her only opportunity.

250
00:15:26,004 --> 00:15:30,215
- She can't get out of the house?
- She needed me to make it happen.

251
00:15:30,425 --> 00:15:33,461
She's not in a state
to make her own decision?

252
00:15:33,845 --> 00:15:38,008
- No, she just needed a push.
- And you pushed her?

253
00:15:39,683 --> 00:15:42,553
- I don't know.
- Did you give her options?

254
00:15:42,727 --> 00:15:47,768
Yes. The husband won't let her adopt
out. It's gonna push her over the edge.

255
00:15:47,982 --> 00:15:50,733
If she's gone to this much trouble
to avoid an abortion...

256
00:15:50,901 --> 00:15:53,937
...there's a part of her
that has a problem with it.

257
00:15:54,863 --> 00:15:56,274
Or her husband does.

258
00:15:57,282 --> 00:16:00,366
- Can GYN even do it?
- I haven't asked them.

259
00:16:00,535 --> 00:16:03,452
All right. Talk to them.
It might not even be possible.

260
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:10,459
- Thank you.
- Be careful, Abby. Make sure.

261
00:16:14,505 --> 00:16:19,167
- Your surgical consult is here.
- And who might that be?

262
00:16:19,384 --> 00:16:23,880
- How about a clue?
- Dr. Romano?

263
00:16:24,097 --> 00:16:26,504
Okay. See?

264
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,175
Need a doctor to take a look?

265
00:16:38,067 --> 00:16:41,187
Don't worry about me.
I'm getting some Lasix.

266
00:16:43,155 --> 00:16:46,275
- Belt injury?
- CT is clear. But he's guarding.

267
00:16:46,492 --> 00:16:50,571
You know, just discussing a patient.

268
00:16:50,787 --> 00:16:52,578
I could use a discussion.

269
00:16:52,789 --> 00:16:56,240
- Maybe I should see the patient.
- Good idea.

270
00:16:58,961 --> 00:17:03,918
Eli, Mr. Emerson, this is Dr. Benton.
He's a surgeon.

271
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,415
- How's your belly?
- A little sore.

272
00:17:06,634 --> 00:17:09,385
- Does this hurt?
- Only when you press hard.

273
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:11,006
- Any back pain?
- No.

274
00:17:11,221 --> 00:17:14,507
- His white count is up.
- Was the other surgeon wrong?

275
00:17:15,225 --> 00:17:17,632
- What other surgeon?
- Dr. Corday.

276
00:17:17,811 --> 00:17:20,052
Could you give us a second?

277
00:17:23,816 --> 00:17:27,599
- Elizabeth saw him?
- I didn't get a chance to tell you.

278
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:31,484
I disagreed with her.
I wanted a second opinion.

279
00:17:31,656 --> 00:17:35,025
His belly is fairly benign.
No back or flank pain.

280
00:17:35,242 --> 00:17:38,693
- He could have a bowel leak.
- There's no fever.

281
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:43,827
Delay can raise mortality
from five to 65 percent.

282
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,242
Okay. I'll do an ex-lap, okay?

283
00:17:47,336 --> 00:17:49,080
Thank you, Peter.

284
00:17:49,755 --> 00:17:54,167
- One, two, three.
- Oh, God! Watch my back, would you?

285
00:17:54,342 --> 00:17:56,134
How far did you fall?

286
00:17:56,344 --> 00:17:59,013
- Six, eight feet.
- Coworkers said four.

287
00:17:59,222 --> 00:18:03,219
Four, my ass! I felt a pop.
I think I blew out a disk.

288
00:18:03,434 --> 00:18:05,675
Complains of leg weakness, LOC.

289
00:18:05,894 --> 00:18:08,599
I passed out. Everything went black.

290
00:18:08,813 --> 00:18:11,269
BP's 110/70. Pulse 81.

291
00:18:11,482 --> 00:18:13,142
- Is that bad?
- That's normal.

292
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,648
Press on my hands with your feet.

293
00:18:17,655 --> 00:18:19,197
Jeez!

294
00:18:19,406 --> 00:18:21,648
- That hurt?
- Yeah! What do you think?

295
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:26,534
Does your employer cover
on-the-job injury?

296
00:18:26,704 --> 00:18:29,574
- He better.
- I'm gonna press down.

297
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:33,040
Tell me if it increases
the pain in your back.

298
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:36,246
- Oh, stop, stop!
- Pain is MU.

299
00:18:36,463 --> 00:18:39,878
- What's that?
- We're gonna check it all out.

300
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:44,004
Better get a CBC
and a lumbar-spine series.

301
00:18:44,219 --> 00:18:46,757
- What exactly is MU?
- Made-up.

302
00:18:46,972 --> 00:18:49,297
- You think he's faking?
- Oh, yeah.

303
00:18:50,683 --> 00:18:54,017
Hey. So is it anxiety attacks?

304
00:18:54,228 --> 00:18:57,561
I'm not sure.
But your cardiac enzymes are normal.

305
00:18:57,773 --> 00:19:00,311
And I'm not seeing
irregularities on the EKG.

306
00:19:01,526 --> 00:19:05,476
- I didn't think it was my heart.
- You might be stressed.

307
00:19:05,655 --> 00:19:07,398
I could've told you that.

308
00:19:07,573 --> 00:19:10,360
I still need to monitor you
for six hours to eight hours.

309
00:19:10,826 --> 00:19:12,450
You said everything was okay.

310
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:15,573
Heart damage may not
show up right away.

311
00:19:15,747 --> 00:19:18,783
The way you came in,
I wanna make sure.

312
00:19:19,584 --> 00:19:22,750
I just got myself all worked up.

313
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,661
You see, she's...

314
00:19:25,881 --> 00:19:28,253
She's driving me crazy.

315
00:19:28,425 --> 00:19:31,959
I never wanted a divorce.

316
00:19:34,096 --> 00:19:38,176
- Hell...
- Mr. Simpson. Mr. Simpson.

317
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:42,430
Every time. I'm sorry.
It just hits me.

318
00:19:42,604 --> 00:19:46,222
I don't know what I'm doing.
I'm sorry.

319
00:19:46,441 --> 00:19:50,105
- No, don't worry. It's okay.
- Every day...

320
00:19:50,277 --> 00:19:54,820
Every day another damn letter
or phone call from her lawyer.

321
00:19:56,074 --> 00:19:58,315
More threats, more demands.

322
00:20:02,955 --> 00:20:07,616
I don't know what I did wrong.
I love my son.

323
00:20:08,585 --> 00:20:10,743
I loved her, I still do.

324
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:13,874
I understand.

325
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:18,592
I'm sorry.

326
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:21,675
It's not your problem.

327
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:27,051
Maybe I can get a clinical
psychologist to talk to you.

328
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:29,593
Clinical psychologist?

329
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:33,558
That worse than the ordinary kind?

330
00:20:36,317 --> 00:20:37,646
Hi.

331
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:41,230
I checked on your kids.
They're having a great time.

332
00:20:41,447 --> 00:20:42,645
They need to eat.

333
00:20:42,865 --> 00:20:47,692
They're eating now.
Kids don't complain about hospital food.

334
00:20:52,582 --> 00:20:54,539
You sure this is what you want?

335
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:59,034
No, it's not what I want.
It's what I need.

336
00:21:00,297 --> 00:21:02,834
Okay. I worked it out with GYN.

337
00:21:03,007 --> 00:21:06,376
There's a doctor who can
squeeze you in now.

338
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,342
Take me up before I change my mind.

339
00:21:11,181 --> 00:21:14,052
Yeah. Well, the thing is...

340
00:21:14,351 --> 00:21:17,684
...I'd hate for you to change
your mind later on.

341
00:21:18,229 --> 00:21:19,688
No, I know.

342
00:21:20,022 --> 00:21:23,023
I meant... Forget it.

343
00:21:23,192 --> 00:21:24,437
No, tell me.

344
00:21:27,863 --> 00:21:32,524
I feel like such a hypocrite.
I know that this is so wrong.

345
00:21:32,742 --> 00:21:36,276
I keep telling myself I'm doing
this for my family.

346
00:21:37,871 --> 00:21:39,994
Maybe you better take more time.

347
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:44,623
My husband is a good man
but he'd never understand.

348
00:21:46,796 --> 00:21:51,623
It's better if he doesn't know.
Let's just get it over with.

349
00:21:54,052 --> 00:21:55,380
Okay.

350
00:21:55,929 --> 00:21:57,672
Thank you.

351
00:21:59,807 --> 00:22:01,515
This isn't easy to do alone.

352
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:06,058
An hour of continuous nebs
should do it.

353
00:22:06,271 --> 00:22:08,596
- It's that nurse.
- Now what?

354
00:22:08,815 --> 00:22:11,769
- Your dad made racial slurs.
- She's Swedish.

355
00:22:11,984 --> 00:22:16,278
- Maybe he called her a meatball.
- Say I'm on my way.

356
00:22:16,488 --> 00:22:20,023
I put the shoulder back in.
Check the films.

357
00:22:20,242 --> 00:22:22,448
- Does he have an orthopedist?
- Give it to Ortho.

358
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,902
- You leaving?
- I've been on since 5:30.

359
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:27,404
Can you take Exam 6?

360
00:22:27,623 --> 00:22:29,283
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

361
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,417
- Pull these.
- You have a critical value.

362
00:22:32,628 --> 00:22:35,083
White count's 150,000: leukemia.

363
00:22:35,255 --> 00:22:36,417
- Who?
- Fazio.

364
00:22:36,631 --> 00:22:38,873
- Workers' comp guy?
- What?

365
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:42,258
He fell off a ladder.
Look, 95% blasts.

366
00:22:42,469 --> 00:22:44,676
- Get a Hema-Onc consult.
- Where's Carol?

367
00:22:44,888 --> 00:22:45,967
- Upstairs.
- Again?

368
00:22:46,181 --> 00:22:47,924
- She's on break.
- Again?

369
00:22:48,099 --> 00:22:51,302
- Are you a hall monitor?
- I need an NG tube.

370
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:53,677
- So do it.
- You let this go on?

371
00:22:53,896 --> 00:22:56,138
- Let her be.
- The chief wouldn't.

372
00:22:56,357 --> 00:22:58,894
You try raising two children.

373
00:22:59,109 --> 00:23:00,603
Why should I suffer?

374
00:23:00,777 --> 00:23:03,564
- Quit whining. I'll do it.
- Thanks.

375
00:23:04,739 --> 00:23:06,815
- Where's my MVA?
- Cleo's?

376
00:23:07,033 --> 00:23:08,740
- Yes.
- Benton took him.

377
00:23:08,951 --> 00:23:10,659
- Benton?
- Yeah.

378
00:23:14,831 --> 00:23:16,954
Hey. How are you feeling?

379
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:20,624
Something's wrong.
I'm having back spasms.

380
00:23:20,795 --> 00:23:23,083
The x-ray shows no fractures.

381
00:23:23,255 --> 00:23:27,299
- But I still have pain.
- I'm sure you do.

382
00:23:27,509 --> 00:23:31,838
- I can't work like this.
- You're not going to work.

383
00:23:32,054 --> 00:23:33,762
Yeah? For how long?

384
00:23:35,057 --> 00:23:37,808
You have acute
myelogenous leukemia.

385
00:23:38,727 --> 00:23:41,728
Leukemia? You mean like the cancer?

386
00:23:42,063 --> 00:23:47,401
- Yes. And it can cause bone pain.
- Come on. Get out of here!

387
00:23:47,568 --> 00:23:50,106
- I fell down!
- It's in your blood.

388
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,107
Hematology will admit you...

389
00:23:53,281 --> 00:23:55,772
- ... and start chemo.
- Wait a second.

390
00:23:56,284 --> 00:23:58,442
- I'm sorry.
- We need you now.

391
00:23:58,661 --> 00:24:00,072
- I'll be back.
- Doc!

392
00:24:00,246 --> 00:24:01,704
I'll be right back.

393
00:24:03,999 --> 00:24:06,406
- Push. 2 epi.
- What is it?

394
00:24:06,626 --> 00:24:10,540
- Ten-year-old in shock.
- No response to albuterol.

395
00:24:10,755 --> 00:24:14,206
- Allergies?
- Peanuts. Pressure's dropping.

396
00:24:14,425 --> 00:24:16,631
Draw 75 ketamine, 75 sux.

397
00:24:16,802 --> 00:24:19,838
- Pulse ox 82.
- Start rapid induction.

398
00:24:20,055 --> 00:24:21,383
No, I've got it.

399
00:24:21,556 --> 00:24:22,884
BP is 60 palp.

400
00:24:26,852 --> 00:24:29,141
- Come on. Let's go.
- Hold on.

401
00:24:29,772 --> 00:24:33,520
- You want cricoid pressure?
- I can't pass it.

402
00:24:33,733 --> 00:24:38,027
Set up for fiber-optic intubation.
50 mg of Solu-Medrol.

403
00:24:38,237 --> 00:24:39,945
- Okay, out of the way.
- I've got it.

404
00:24:40,156 --> 00:24:41,863
- You've done one?
- Two.

405
00:24:46,328 --> 00:24:50,325
- Keep gentle tension.
- I know. I'm feeding it in.

406
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:53,908
- There's the epiglottis.
- What are you doing?

407
00:24:54,085 --> 00:24:56,291
- Keep going.
- I can't see.

408
00:24:56,462 --> 00:24:58,371
- Pulse ox 78.
- Bag her.

409
00:24:58,547 --> 00:25:01,084
- I just need to-
- I said, get out.

410
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:04,834
- What? I almost had it.
- I'm taking over.

411
00:25:05,011 --> 00:25:06,339
John!

412
00:25:06,512 --> 00:25:09,596
- Up to 82.
- All right. Let's go again.

413
00:25:13,393 --> 00:25:17,889
- Thank you. He'll be better tomorrow.
- He couldn't be worse.

414
00:25:18,064 --> 00:25:20,056
Is she gone?

415
00:25:22,651 --> 00:25:24,809
Yeah, okay? She's gone.

416
00:25:24,987 --> 00:25:27,738
- We'll be lucky if she returns.
- Says you.

417
00:25:27,906 --> 00:25:30,823
We need her.
Someone has to be here.

418
00:25:31,034 --> 00:25:33,405
Not if I went to the hospice.

419
00:25:33,577 --> 00:25:36,282
You'd be surrounded by strangers.

420
00:25:36,497 --> 00:25:38,904
No stranger than Nurse Von B low.

421
00:25:39,082 --> 00:25:43,494
And look at this room.
It's like a damn hospital!

422
00:25:43,711 --> 00:25:46,831
- How much is this costing?
- Don't worry.

423
00:25:47,048 --> 00:25:50,796
- What the hell is that?
- A portable toilet.

424
00:25:50,968 --> 00:25:56,044
- You got me a Johnny-on-the-spot?
- It's just for convenience.

425
00:25:56,264 --> 00:26:00,890
I am not taking a dump
in your living room, Mark!

426
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:06,059
I am not an invalid!
I can still make it to the bathroom!

427
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:09,148
Dad. Sit down. Come on, sit down.

428
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:13,895
- Sit and relax.
- This is what I didn't want happening.

429
00:26:14,071 --> 00:26:16,313
- Relax.
- I won't use it.

430
00:26:16,532 --> 00:26:21,442
I'll get your albuterol, okay?
I'll take it back, all right?

431
00:26:21,661 --> 00:26:23,950
Here. Just take a few puffs.

432
00:26:25,164 --> 00:26:27,737
Nice and easy. Calm down.

433
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:35,164
- Where is he?
- The suit.

434
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:41,001
- Mr. Parker? I'm Abby.
- Hi. You're taking care of my wife?

435
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:44,968
Yes. She was a little dehydrated
and tired.

436
00:26:45,182 --> 00:26:46,889
She came by ambulance.

437
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,718
It's standard when patients
lose consciousness.

438
00:26:51,145 --> 00:26:52,473
- God.
- It's okay.

439
00:26:52,688 --> 00:26:55,357
Mostly, she just needs to rest.

440
00:26:56,191 --> 00:26:58,943
She overdoes it.
She does too much.

441
00:26:59,444 --> 00:27:04,236
- You should get her some help at home.
- Yeah. Can I see her?

442
00:27:05,032 --> 00:27:09,077
- She went upstairs for tests.
- What kind of tests?

443
00:27:09,536 --> 00:27:13,284
She was anemic.
We checked her heart and blood.

444
00:27:13,456 --> 00:27:16,825
- Let's find your kids.
- Okay.

445
00:27:17,043 --> 00:27:22,285
- But she only needs rest.
- She does. We're being thorough.

446
00:27:22,464 --> 00:27:25,334
- I should be there.
- That'd be difficult.

447
00:27:26,343 --> 00:27:29,343
- What's all this?
- I've got an ex-lap.

448
00:27:29,554 --> 00:27:34,464
- Were you going to call me?
- I didn't know I needed permission.

449
00:27:34,683 --> 00:27:38,016
Did your friend tell you
I'd examined the patient?

450
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:43,977
- Dr. Finch advised me of your opinion.
- I bet she did.

451
00:27:44,192 --> 00:27:48,023
- I made my assessment.
- That boy is asymptomatic...

452
00:27:48,237 --> 00:27:51,985
- ... except for a bruise.
- His white count rose.

453
00:27:52,449 --> 00:27:56,695
- She should've called me.
- You'd made up your mind.

454
00:27:56,911 --> 00:27:59,117
I was observing him.

455
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:03,161
She may not be as comfortable
with me as you...

456
00:28:03,333 --> 00:28:06,619
...but I might have changed my mind.

457
00:28:06,836 --> 00:28:08,461
Maybe.

458
00:28:10,923 --> 00:28:12,252
Stop scrubbing.

459
00:28:12,758 --> 00:28:15,047
- What?
- You heard me, I said stop.

460
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:19,719
- I'm operating on him.
- No, you're not. I am.

461
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,222
- I'm ready.
- Sorry to have wasted your time.

462
00:28:24,435 --> 00:28:27,685
It's my prerogative
to schedule cases...

463
00:28:27,896 --> 00:28:30,932
...especially ones I've seen first.

464
00:28:31,149 --> 00:28:35,894
- You mean you're pulling rank on me?
- Absolutely.

465
00:28:36,696 --> 00:28:38,024
- Carter?
- Yeah.

466
00:28:38,197 --> 00:28:41,648
Dan Shine.
You sent me a patient for a biopsy.

467
00:28:41,867 --> 00:28:44,109
- How'd it go?
- His bone marrow is normal.

468
00:28:45,579 --> 00:28:49,991
- No. He had 95% blasts.
- Someone else did. He's normal.

469
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:51,239
What?

470
00:28:51,417 --> 00:28:56,328
They mixed up records.
Do you have a patient named Simpson?

471
00:28:58,173 --> 00:29:01,542
- Can you find Dr. Kovac?
- Just a second.

472
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:03,799
No, now!

473
00:29:06,013 --> 00:29:09,595
- Did you talk to him?
- You might want to go up.

474
00:29:09,808 --> 00:29:12,928
I stuck him,
then told him we were wrong.

475
00:29:13,144 --> 00:29:16,098
That he wouldn't die.
He wants to sue.

476
00:29:16,314 --> 00:29:17,891
I'm sure he did.

477
00:29:18,107 --> 00:29:20,514
Excuse me? They took my wife up.

478
00:29:20,734 --> 00:29:24,814
I wanted to see if she was back.
The name's Parker.

479
00:29:26,489 --> 00:29:27,983
Gynecology Clinic.

480
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:32,066
Wait. Gynecology Clinic?
I thought she was anemic.

481
00:29:32,286 --> 00:29:36,746
I didn't take care of her.
You can wait right over there.

482
00:29:36,915 --> 00:29:39,584
- Call me if you find Simpson.
- Yeah.

483
00:29:42,712 --> 00:29:45,547
- Excuse me, what's your name?
- Abby.

484
00:29:45,756 --> 00:29:50,583
Abby, yeah. It says "GYN"
by my wife's name. Is that right?

485
00:29:50,761 --> 00:29:54,094
Why don't you have a seat?
I'll check.

486
00:29:54,264 --> 00:29:57,549
- Is there something wrong?
- No, she's fine.

487
00:29:57,725 --> 00:30:01,224
Why is she in Gynecology?
Is she pregnant?

488
00:30:01,437 --> 00:30:02,979
You should wait.

489
00:30:03,188 --> 00:30:07,896
I don't want to wait anymore!
Tell me what's wrong with her.

490
00:30:08,109 --> 00:30:10,434
- I can't.
- Why?

491
00:30:10,611 --> 00:30:13,280
Medical information is private.

492
00:30:13,489 --> 00:30:16,110
It's my wife. What can't I know?

493
00:30:16,325 --> 00:30:18,862
- Mr. Parker-
- Is she having an abortion?

494
00:30:24,248 --> 00:30:26,656
- Is she?
- I can't say.

495
00:30:28,335 --> 00:30:30,126
What floor is Gynecology on?

496
00:30:31,463 --> 00:30:34,380
- What floor is Gynecology on?!
- Ninth.

497
00:30:39,386 --> 00:30:42,008
- You needed me, Carter?
- Yeah.

498
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:51,471
- You're sure it's not another mistake?
- We double-checked.

499
00:30:55,317 --> 00:30:57,309
How long?

500
00:30:58,111 --> 00:31:02,607
- It's hard for me to say.
- Ballpark, best guess.

501
00:31:03,824 --> 00:31:05,900
With a bone-marrow transplant...

502
00:31:06,076 --> 00:31:09,777
...there's a 60 percent survival rate
at five years.

503
00:31:11,581 --> 00:31:13,621
Without one?

504
00:31:13,833 --> 00:31:18,293
Chemotherapy alone?
About half of that.

505
00:31:19,922 --> 00:31:22,839
We'll do what we can
to find a match.

506
00:31:23,008 --> 00:31:25,925
Type your family: brothers, sisters-

507
00:31:26,136 --> 00:31:27,962
I don't have any brothers or sisters.

508
00:31:29,514 --> 00:31:33,511
- Are your parents living?
- I have an uncle.

509
00:31:33,726 --> 00:31:35,350
That's good.

510
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:36,847
And your son.

511
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,764
He's only 8.

512
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,224
Probably the best chance.

513
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:49,568
I should call my wife.

514
00:31:53,618 --> 00:31:55,112
Yeah.

515
00:31:58,456 --> 00:32:02,535
- You called for a consult?
- Yeah. Abdominal pain.

516
00:32:02,751 --> 00:32:06,285
- A hot appy.
- Didn't bring them to the O.R. yourself?

517
00:32:06,504 --> 00:32:10,502
- Temp's 101.
- I just closed Eli Emerson's belly.

518
00:32:10,716 --> 00:32:14,251
- I thought Peter was-
- No, he was my consult.

519
00:32:14,428 --> 00:32:17,512
- There's no perforation.
- What a relief.

520
00:32:18,473 --> 00:32:22,387
- Pity I had to cut him open.
- Better to know than regret it later.

521
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,935
Yes.

522
00:32:25,521 --> 00:32:28,094
You may have special access
to Peter...

523
00:32:28,315 --> 00:32:32,443
...but from now on,
come to me if you have a problem.

524
00:32:32,652 --> 00:32:35,225
Obviously you agreed with him.

525
00:32:35,446 --> 00:32:38,233
- "Yes, Elizabeth," will do.
- Do you want this?

526
00:32:38,908 --> 00:32:41,030
- Which room?
- Four.

527
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:47,487
- Hey, what's going on?
- They took all my stuff.

528
00:32:47,707 --> 00:32:49,995
The city swept his street.

529
00:32:50,209 --> 00:32:55,630
- When was your last drink?
- I tried to get up on a dumpster.

530
00:32:55,797 --> 00:32:59,083
- They pushed me down.
- How much have you had?

531
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:03,167
They took my pillows.
I had a tarp for rain.

532
00:33:03,387 --> 00:33:05,546
- Have you eaten?
- No money.

533
00:33:05,764 --> 00:33:09,133
Let's get a banana bag.
CBC and blood alcohol.

534
00:33:09,351 --> 00:33:11,178
- Did you hit your head?
- What?

535
00:33:11,394 --> 00:33:14,597
- Did you hit your head?
- Hold still, Pablo.

536
00:33:14,814 --> 00:33:16,273
- Let me go.
- Hold still.

537
00:33:16,482 --> 00:33:18,391
No.

538
00:33:18,776 --> 00:33:21,776
- Soft restraints.
- It's okay.

539
00:33:22,487 --> 00:33:26,235
- Call Security.
- It was an accident. Pablo, be still.

540
00:33:26,449 --> 00:33:27,777
- What's that?
- Haldol.

541
00:33:27,951 --> 00:33:29,943
- What? No!
- Let me go.

542
00:33:30,161 --> 00:33:32,367
- Carter, what are you doing?
- No. Carter.

543
00:33:33,622 --> 00:33:35,496
- What's wrong?
- He's violent.

544
00:33:35,707 --> 00:33:39,325
It was an accident.
They don't come any gentler.

545
00:33:39,544 --> 00:33:41,869
- Are you going to help?
- No!

546
00:33:42,088 --> 00:33:44,246
All right, fine.
Call me when he calms down.

547
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:59,930
- You got any four-by-fours in here?
- Let me check.

548
00:34:00,145 --> 00:34:03,728
- Xeroform, Adaptic...
- If not, in the suture room.

549
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:07,475
Hold on, I'm still looking.
Here we go.

550
00:34:10,029 --> 00:34:12,816
- What's going on?
- What, with Pablo?

551
00:34:13,032 --> 00:34:17,159
Your overreaction to Pablo.
Or am I now overreacting?

552
00:34:17,327 --> 00:34:21,159
I was being careful.
Maybe it was a bad call.

553
00:34:21,372 --> 00:34:24,041
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

554
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,951
I know what it's like
to have life change.

555
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:31,289
A year ago I was living with Doug.

556
00:34:31,506 --> 00:34:35,254
Now I'm living alone with two babies.
Go figure.

557
00:34:35,468 --> 00:34:39,216
- Yeah.
- It takes a while to deal with it...

558
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:41,469
...to get used to it.

559
00:34:42,266 --> 00:34:45,100
You still need to get used to it.

560
00:34:47,186 --> 00:34:50,769
- Lucy matched.
- Oh, God. Where?

561
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:54,308
Here. Got a spot in Psych.

562
00:34:55,277 --> 00:34:56,854
Go figure.

563
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:02,151
There's always gonna be something.

564
00:35:04,952 --> 00:35:07,869
Well, what are you gonna do?

565
00:35:09,081 --> 00:35:10,954
Go back to work.

566
00:35:15,711 --> 00:35:18,629
- She's not really Swedish.
- What?

567
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:22,919
Fredriksson. She's married to a Swede.
She's Dutch.

568
00:35:23,135 --> 00:35:26,883
- So you did talk to her.
- No, I didn't talk.

569
00:35:27,096 --> 00:35:29,421
She yapped and yapped.

570
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:34,385
Finally, about halfway through
watching Rosie O 'Donnell...

571
00:35:34,603 --> 00:35:38,268
...I said to stick her thumb
in her dike and shut up.

572
00:35:38,481 --> 00:35:41,268
- You didn't.
- Sure, I did.

573
00:35:41,734 --> 00:35:44,307
To stick her thumb in her dike?

574
00:35:44,528 --> 00:35:49,237
She got what I meant.
And it worked. Not another word.

575
00:35:49,408 --> 00:35:52,077
- What is this?
- Meatloaf.

576
00:35:53,036 --> 00:35:55,906
The only recipe of Mom's
I remember.

577
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,701
- Where's the egg?
- What egg?

578
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:02,121
Your mom cooked it with an egg.

579
00:36:02,336 --> 00:36:04,375
You'd get a sliver per slice.

580
00:36:05,922 --> 00:36:07,297
I forgot.

581
00:36:12,094 --> 00:36:16,091
I never much liked the egg,
always ate around it.

582
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,927
Okay.

583
00:36:27,024 --> 00:36:32,444
- Work was pretty decent today.
- That's good.

584
00:36:36,157 --> 00:36:37,781
So anything happen here?

585
00:36:39,952 --> 00:36:41,861
Like what?

586
00:36:42,037 --> 00:36:44,991
I don't know.
Maybe you and she did something.

587
00:36:45,206 --> 00:36:47,662
What the hell would we do?
Play Parcheesi?

588
00:36:48,709 --> 00:36:51,200
Dad, forget it. Okay?

589
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,993
I was just making conversation.

590
00:36:56,424 --> 00:36:59,544
Yeah, okay. Whatever.

591
00:37:03,973 --> 00:37:06,261
Your mom served it with peas.

592
00:37:06,475 --> 00:37:09,048
Not with string beans.

593
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:12,970
Yeah. I guess so.

594
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,484
- Hey, Abby.
- Hey.

595
00:37:21,488 --> 00:37:23,112
How's she doing?

596
00:37:23,406 --> 00:37:27,653
- Pretty well. She's gonna be okay.
- That's good.

597
00:37:27,827 --> 00:37:32,619
I want to apologize.
I let my emotions get the best of me.

598
00:37:32,831 --> 00:37:34,409
Of course.

599
00:37:34,583 --> 00:37:37,156
Lynn let herself get rundown.

600
00:37:37,335 --> 00:37:39,375
She just got depressed.

601
00:37:40,338 --> 00:37:42,081
I guess I didn't see.

602
00:37:42,298 --> 00:37:44,670
It's easy for that to happen.

603
00:37:45,676 --> 00:37:49,839
She's resting now.
I'm gonna check on my kids.

604
00:37:50,055 --> 00:37:51,679
Sure.

605
00:38:00,189 --> 00:38:02,940
- Hi, how are you doing?
- I'm okay.

606
00:38:03,149 --> 00:38:07,692
- I saw your husband.
- He was upset, but he's better now.

607
00:38:07,904 --> 00:38:10,145
He forgave me.

608
00:38:11,865 --> 00:38:16,028
- He forgave you?
- We all make mistakes sometimes.

609
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:20,497
What you did today
was a mistake?

610
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:23,704
He didn't call it that.
Just a moment of weakness.

611
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:30,246
- Well, what do you think?
- He talked to a doctor. I'll be fine.

612
00:38:30,465 --> 00:38:34,961
- We'll be able to try again soon.
- For another baby?

613
00:38:35,178 --> 00:38:37,882
Ken's a wonderful father.

614
00:38:38,055 --> 00:38:42,348
We both love kids.
We've always wanted a big family.

615
00:38:44,686 --> 00:38:46,678
Kids are great.

616
00:38:49,023 --> 00:38:52,771
- Why don't you rest, okay?
- Thanks.

617
00:39:05,662 --> 00:39:09,790
- Look at Kate's hat. She's so cute.
- Isn't that Tess?

618
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Nope. Tess is the one eating the hat.

619
00:39:13,211 --> 00:39:15,618
- Hey, Luka. You off?
- No.

620
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:18,543
Heading out to meet a trauma. You?

621
00:39:18,757 --> 00:39:22,422
- After I pick up the girls.
- Isn't that adorable?

622
00:39:22,636 --> 00:39:24,295
Yeah. Very beautiful.

623
00:39:25,471 --> 00:39:27,464
- See you.
- Bye.

624
00:39:28,266 --> 00:39:31,681
- Has anyone seen Benton?
- I think he crashed.

625
00:39:31,894 --> 00:39:34,384
- Oh, God! Dr. Kovac...
- What?

626
00:39:34,604 --> 00:39:38,269
- He had two children. Two, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

627
00:39:44,738 --> 00:39:48,818
- Hey.
- Hey. Where are the girls?

628
00:39:49,034 --> 00:39:53,612
I'm on my way up to get them.
How much longer are you on?

629
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:57,079
If Romano has his way,
probably forever.

630
00:39:58,334 --> 00:40:02,117
Luka, I just realized,
looking at those pictures...

631
00:40:02,337 --> 00:40:05,788
I've never seen
any pictures of your children.

632
00:40:05,965 --> 00:40:09,416
- You want to see one?
- That'd be great.

633
00:40:19,185 --> 00:40:22,601
Jasna. That was her birthday party.

634
00:40:22,813 --> 00:40:24,142
She was 4.

635
00:40:24,815 --> 00:40:29,607
- She's beautiful. So is your wife.
- Yeah, she was.

636
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,115
- Can I see your son?
- I don't have any.

637
00:40:35,741 --> 00:40:38,528
You don't have any now, or at all?

638
00:40:38,744 --> 00:40:40,452
I'm lucky to have this.

639
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:43,947
No, to see Marco...

640
00:40:44,124 --> 00:40:48,037
...I just have to close my eyes
and he's there.

641
00:40:49,211 --> 00:40:53,624
Usually with chocolate ice cream
on his face and hands.

642
00:40:57,719 --> 00:41:02,297
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no. Thank you for asking.

643
00:41:06,018 --> 00:41:08,888
Oh, here I go. Back to work.

644
00:41:09,646 --> 00:41:11,934
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

645
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:23,898
- What is it?
- It's me.

646
00:41:24,826 --> 00:41:26,569
Cleo.

647
00:41:27,186 --> 00:41:30,073
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. Lie down.

648
00:41:30,247 --> 00:41:35,372
- I thought you were going home.
- Maybe later.

649
00:41:37,378 --> 00:41:39,834
This is okay for now.

650
00:42:05,445 --> 00:42:08,647
Dr. John. I thought the dog got in.

651
00:42:08,864 --> 00:42:11,022
No, it's just me, Corrine.

652
00:42:12,075 --> 00:42:14,151
- Couldn't sleep?
- No.

653
00:42:15,912 --> 00:42:19,530
- You want me to make something?
- I'm fine. Thanks.

654
00:42:20,291 --> 00:42:21,951
Okay.

655
00:42:22,543 --> 00:42:24,416
- Good night.
- Good night.

656
00:42:37,556 --> 00:42:38,884
Mark!

657
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:41,849
Mark!

658
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:44,474
- Dad?
- Mark!

659
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:46,223
Just a second.

660
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:52,316
- What's wrong?
- I told you this would get in the way.

661
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:53,814
What happened?

662
00:42:53,987 --> 00:42:58,649
I was trying to go to the bathroom.
I got tangled up in these.

663
00:42:58,866 --> 00:43:01,737
- Damn!
- I should've moved this stuff.

664
00:43:03,204 --> 00:43:07,070
I should be able to go to
the bathroom by myself.

665
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:10,493
It's my fault.
I didn't leave a lamp on.

666
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:13,580
I tried. But I got tangled up...

667
00:43:16,757 --> 00:43:18,749
It's no big deal, Dad.

668
00:43:19,926 --> 00:43:22,002
My pajamas are soaked!

669
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:23,963
Well, don't worry.

670
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:27,465
I haven't wet the bed
since I was 5!

671
00:43:30,894 --> 00:43:35,805
All right. Just sit down here, okay?
I'll put the shower on.

672
00:43:37,275 --> 00:43:40,229
You shouldn't have to do this, Mark.

673
00:43:42,446 --> 00:43:45,945
Think how many times
you did this for me when I was little.

674
00:43:46,158 --> 00:43:48,399
Well, I'm a grown man.

675
00:43:49,452 --> 00:43:51,409
Whoa, wait, wait.

676
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:58,538
This isn't right, Mark.

677
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:04,456
- It just isn't right.
- I know, Dad.

678
00:44:04,716 --> 00:44:06,340
I know.

679
00:44:09,303 --> 00:44:11,628
Let's just rest for a minute.
