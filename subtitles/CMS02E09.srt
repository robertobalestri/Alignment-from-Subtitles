1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:02,040
- April.
- Huh?

2
00:00:02,074 --> 00:00:04,109
- Cutting board?
- Corner cabinet

3
00:00:04,143 --> 00:00:05,143
by the lazy Susan.

4
00:00:05,177 --> 00:00:06,845
- Yeah.
- And you still haven't

5
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,047
weighed in on the paint choices
that I asked you about.

6
00:00:09,081 --> 00:00:11,049
Uh, what room is that for again?

7
00:00:11,083 --> 00:00:13,184
The den. Come on, Tate.

8
00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:14,786
I've been working
on this remodel for weeks.

9
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,488
I know. I know. I'm sorry, babe.

10
00:00:16,522 --> 00:00:19,791
I love that you're
making my house our house.

11
00:00:19,825 --> 00:00:22,127
I love that we set a date
for the wedding.

12
00:00:22,161 --> 00:00:24,129
- But I'm driving you crazy.
- Yep.

13
00:00:24,163 --> 00:00:25,463
You know what?

14
00:00:25,498 --> 00:00:28,800
Stuck in a house on TB leave...
I get it.

15
00:00:28,834 --> 00:00:30,535
I mean, I've been trying to keep busy,

16
00:00:30,569 --> 00:00:34,606
'cause when I'm not,
I can't help but worry.

17
00:00:35,574 --> 00:00:37,475
First ultrasound today.

18
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,344
Yeah.

19
00:00:39,378 --> 00:00:41,279
It's gonna be perfect.

20
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,430
Are you crazy? Where's your jacket?

21
00:00:59,465 --> 00:01:02,400
Don't need it.
I love the crisp winter air.

22
00:01:02,434 --> 00:01:04,235
Yeah, right. I can see your goose bumps.

23
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:07,105
Oh, you mean my pilomotor reflex?

24
00:01:07,139 --> 00:01:09,507
Oh, good God.

25
00:01:09,542 --> 00:01:11,576
Anyway, this weather is balmy.

26
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,344
Do you remember that February

27
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:15,246
when you and Jeff and me and Lisa

28
00:01:15,281 --> 00:01:17,182
we rented that cabin at Lake Mendota?

29
00:01:17,216 --> 00:01:18,583
- Yes.
- And then we got hammered

30
00:01:18,617 --> 00:01:20,585
on that box of wine
we found in the pantry.

31
00:01:20,619 --> 00:01:22,387
Which led to the hot tub.

32
00:01:22,421 --> 00:01:23,621
Which led to you sneaking a peek.

33
00:01:23,656 --> 00:01:27,192
I did not! Did you?

34
00:01:27,226 --> 00:01:29,360
No. Course not.

35
00:01:30,963 --> 00:01:32,397
You're terrible.

36
00:01:32,431 --> 00:01:34,365
Ugh!

37
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,534
Seems like a lifetime ago.

38
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:39,237
How'd we lose touch for so long?

39
00:01:39,271 --> 00:01:40,638
I'm not sure.

40
00:01:44,944 --> 00:01:46,945
Life of a med student. Lunch'll wait.

41
00:01:50,482 --> 00:01:53,251
Ricky Wade, GCS 15, vitals stable.

42
00:01:53,285 --> 00:01:54,619
You're going to Treatment 4, Dr. Choi.

43
00:01:54,653 --> 00:01:56,254
Trauma to the left ear with hematoma,

44
00:01:56,288 --> 00:01:57,889
multiple dislocated fingers,

45
00:01:57,923 --> 00:01:59,490
expanding hematoma
of the anterior thigh.

46
00:01:59,525 --> 00:02:01,159
Refused the board and collar.

47
00:02:01,193 --> 00:02:02,427
I'm not a cripple. I could'a walked.

48
00:02:02,461 --> 00:02:03,880
I know. MMA. Feel no pain, right?

49
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,663
Any loss of consciousness? Dizziness?

50
00:02:05,698 --> 00:02:07,565
Hell no. That bitch barely connected.

51
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,900
Cage doc called the fight.

52
00:02:08,934 --> 00:02:10,001
Said it was a freakin' bloodbath.

53
00:02:10,035 --> 00:02:11,302
All right. Let's get an IV in him,

54
00:02:11,337 --> 00:02:12,303
then a gram of Ancef.

55
00:02:12,338 --> 00:02:14,305
The opponent?

56
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,940
Yep. You're going to Treatment 3.

57
00:02:15,975 --> 00:02:18,676
- Thanks.
- Cyrus Hammad. GCS 15.

58
00:02:18,711 --> 00:02:20,178
Significant swelling to his left eye

59
00:02:20,212 --> 00:02:21,412
and bruising on the right flank.

60
00:02:21,447 --> 00:02:22,513
No loss of consciousness,

61
00:02:22,548 --> 00:02:24,415
but the fight doc wanted
to have him looked at anyway.

62
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,650
You're lucky that doc stopped the fight.

63
00:02:25,684 --> 00:02:27,452
I would've pounded you into a living...

64
00:02:27,486 --> 00:02:30,922
Hey! Not in the cage anymore,
huh? Give it a rest.

65
00:02:30,956 --> 00:02:32,657
History and physical
and a detailed neuro exam.

66
00:02:32,691 --> 00:02:34,292
Got it. I'll shout if I need you.

67
00:02:34,326 --> 00:02:35,627
Yeah.

68
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,264
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

69
00:02:39,298 --> 00:02:40,965
I'm looking for my brother,
Cyrus Hammad.

70
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,967
Cheating-ass punks.

71
00:02:43,002 --> 00:02:44,669
What did you do? Grease some palms?

72
00:02:44,703 --> 00:02:46,271
You know your bro was
getting his ass beat.

73
00:02:46,305 --> 00:02:47,538
I'm gonna need security in the ED.

74
00:02:47,573 --> 00:02:49,307
Dr. Choi! Stop him!

75
00:02:49,341 --> 00:02:53,211
Come on! Come on! Come on!

76
00:02:53,245 --> 00:02:54,379
Chill out!

77
00:02:54,413 --> 00:02:56,281
Walk away.

78
00:02:56,315 --> 00:02:57,749
You okay? Yeah.

79
00:02:59,811 --> 00:03:06,660
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

80
00:03:07,568 --> 00:03:10,815
It's swollen. Let's get
some ice on his thigh and hands.

81
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:13,782
Had that A-rab eating mat
in the first round.

82
00:03:13,817 --> 00:03:15,617
Should'a stomped him into oblivion.

83
00:03:15,652 --> 00:03:17,686
You've got a lot of blood
in your ear, Mr. Wade.

84
00:03:17,721 --> 00:03:19,455
I need to release the pressure
around the cartilage

85
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:20,522
or it will cauliflower.

86
00:03:20,557 --> 00:03:21,718
Skip the lido.

87
00:03:22,237 --> 00:03:24,339
Last thing I need's
a mile-long hospital bill.

88
00:03:24,373 --> 00:03:26,975
You're gonna feel it. You sure?

89
00:03:28,077 --> 00:03:29,644
Suit yourself.

90
00:03:35,551 --> 00:03:37,418
Damn it, that hurts like a mother.

91
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,221
Bastard was all about cheap shots.

92
00:03:40,255 --> 00:03:42,676
Towel head. What do you expect?

93
00:03:46,095 --> 00:03:47,428
Gonna put a dressing on the ear

94
00:03:47,463 --> 00:03:49,364
and get a CT head and face.

95
00:03:49,398 --> 00:03:51,032
Also some X-rays of the hands.

96
00:03:59,119 --> 00:04:00,579
What have we got?

97
00:04:00,614 --> 00:04:02,481
Moderate swelling in his left orbit,

98
00:04:02,516 --> 00:04:03,516
probable fracture.

99
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:06,485
Inbreds. Always go
for the low-hanging fruit.

100
00:04:07,128 --> 00:04:08,307
Elbow strike?

101
00:04:08,454 --> 00:04:09,821
Hammerfist.

102
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:12,524
Sounds bad. I know.
But it was a legal shot.

103
00:04:15,595 --> 00:04:17,095
May have a couple fractured ribs.

104
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,431
CT orbits and facial bones to start,

105
00:04:19,465 --> 00:04:20,765
chest X-ray for the ribs?

106
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,778
Thanks.

107
00:04:25,805 --> 00:04:27,439
I should hit up Rasheed.

108
00:04:27,473 --> 00:04:28,907
Get these jackasses in the parking lot,

109
00:04:28,941 --> 00:04:30,208
show them how the towel heads do it.

110
00:04:30,243 --> 00:04:32,110
Aamir, let it go.

111
00:04:32,145 --> 00:04:33,818
This is why you fight, Cyrus.

112
00:04:33,843 --> 00:04:35,244
Not anymore.

113
00:04:35,481 --> 00:04:37,048
You can't control ignorance,

114
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,810
only how you react.

115
00:04:39,252 --> 00:04:41,716
Surah Al shura verse 40.

116
00:04:59,572 --> 00:05:01,139
Scans may take a while.

117
00:05:01,174 --> 00:05:03,178
Moving around's gonna hurt like hell.

118
00:05:03,212 --> 00:05:04,585
How's a bit of morphine sound?

119
00:05:04,619 --> 00:05:05,757
Like heaven.

120
00:05:13,151 --> 00:05:16,154
Findings showed that people
with higher confidence tend

121
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:18,223
to use open, expansive postures.

122
00:05:18,257 --> 00:05:21,059
Sure. Runner crosses the finish line,

123
00:05:21,093 --> 00:05:22,312
throw their hands up in victory.

124
00:05:22,347 --> 00:05:25,823
Exactly. Conversely,
those who are timid or defensive

125
00:05:25,857 --> 00:05:27,209
make themselves small.

126
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,289
They'll slouch in their seats,

127
00:05:28,303 --> 00:05:29,603
cross their arms, their legs,

128
00:05:29,638 --> 00:05:32,273
and actually what is really cool
is, um...

129
00:05:32,307 --> 00:05:33,908
Hey. How you guys doing?

130
00:05:33,942 --> 00:05:35,576
- Good, good.
- So far, so good.

131
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,978
You know, just another day.

132
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:43,250
Um, so, dinner tonight? Our usual spot?

133
00:05:43,285 --> 00:05:45,386
- You got it.
- Good.

134
00:05:46,688 --> 00:05:48,389
Bye.

135
00:05:50,992 --> 00:05:52,560
I will catch you guys later.

136
00:05:56,421 --> 00:05:58,122
Crossed arms.

137
00:05:58,147 --> 00:05:59,781
- What?
- Crossed arms.

138
00:06:01,536 --> 00:06:03,938
Sorry. Hey, Daniel?

139
00:06:03,972 --> 00:06:07,675
I need you to evaluate
a potential organ recipient

140
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:11,330
to see if she's a candidate
for transplant.

141
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:15,146
Her name's Meghan Scott.
LVAD. Still in SICU.

142
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,812
I know it's delicate,

143
00:06:16,847 --> 00:06:20,351
but if you could get it back
to me by the end of the day?

144
00:06:20,385 --> 00:06:21,533
I will do my very best.

145
00:06:21,567 --> 00:06:22,723
Thank you.

146
00:06:23,988 --> 00:06:26,089
Yeah. For two at 8:00 p.m.

147
00:06:26,251 --> 00:06:28,152
Great. Thank you.

148
00:06:29,428 --> 00:06:31,328
Look at you, all smiles.

149
00:06:31,363 --> 00:06:32,388
Hot date?

150
00:06:32,422 --> 00:06:34,498
- Surprise date.
- Oh, shh.

151
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:36,617
I'm taking Nina to this
French restaurant on Monroe,

152
00:06:36,652 --> 00:06:38,536
- Cochon Volant Brasserie.
- Nice.

153
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,838
<i>Actually, it's Cochon Volant Brasserie.</i>

154
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:42,967
Dr. Stohl.

155
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:44,810
Personally, I prefer Alinea.

156
00:06:44,844 --> 00:06:47,879
It's American molecular
gastronomy at its finest.

157
00:06:47,914 --> 00:06:50,032
Highly ranked on the S.Pelligrino list.

158
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,448
Didn't realize you were back
from your sabbatical already.

159
00:06:52,483 --> 00:06:53,716
Or that you spoke French.

160
00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:55,251
Enough to get by.

161
00:06:58,589 --> 00:07:00,189
Something I can do for you, Dr. Stohl?

162
00:07:00,823 --> 00:07:02,658
My "sabbatical" was

163
00:07:02,693 --> 00:07:05,394
a World Health Organization assignment.

164
00:07:05,429 --> 00:07:08,397
I advised nongovernmental
emergency medical teams

165
00:07:08,432 --> 00:07:12,635
on how best to respond and treat SODs.

166
00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:14,829
Sudden Onset Disasters.

167
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:17,740
We should sit down and talk about it.

168
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,842
Sure. Sounds great.

169
00:07:24,114 --> 00:07:25,648
Who is that?

170
00:07:25,682 --> 00:07:27,650
The troll.

171
00:07:27,684 --> 00:07:30,219
Our beloved Chief of Emergency Medicine.

172
00:07:30,254 --> 00:07:31,521
Okay.

173
00:07:31,555 --> 00:07:33,556
Talk about sudden onset disasters.

174
00:07:34,484 --> 00:07:36,652
I've been sober almost three years.

175
00:07:37,151 --> 00:07:38,895
It's... it's not been easy.

176
00:07:38,929 --> 00:07:41,531
Temptation never really goes away.

177
00:07:41,565 --> 00:07:43,399
But you've done it, Mom.

178
00:07:43,433 --> 00:07:45,568
Um, you been going to meetings?

179
00:07:45,602 --> 00:07:48,387
Alcoholics Anonymous? I tried,

180
00:07:48,412 --> 00:07:51,440
but the endless talk
about hitting rock bottom...

181
00:07:51,475 --> 00:07:53,776
I know it's supposed to be cathartic,

182
00:07:53,811 --> 00:07:56,962
but it just put me
in a worse mental space.

183
00:07:57,881 --> 00:08:00,391
So, no meetings, no therapy.

184
00:08:00,425 --> 00:08:02,778
Um, any relapses?

185
00:08:03,731 --> 00:08:06,789
Wow. Well, it's remarkable that
you've been able to stay sober.

186
00:08:06,823 --> 00:08:07,930
Congratulations.

187
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:09,389
Thank you.

188
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:11,928
I... I started meditating

189
00:08:11,962 --> 00:08:15,672
and setting small, achievable goals,

190
00:08:15,725 --> 00:08:17,460
and of course, Bria.

191
00:08:18,562 --> 00:08:21,897
The crew Mom used to hang with...

192
00:08:21,932 --> 00:08:24,400
I helped her see they were
bad influences.

193
00:08:24,434 --> 00:08:25,701
She dropped them all.

194
00:08:25,735 --> 00:08:28,132
No more bars, nightlife.

195
00:08:29,072 --> 00:08:32,007
She's a homebody now.

196
00:08:32,042 --> 00:08:35,144
It's senior year. Must be nice
to have Mom home more.

197
00:08:35,178 --> 00:08:37,980
- Is college in the picture?
- Yes.

198
00:08:38,014 --> 00:08:39,849
But not right away.

199
00:08:39,883 --> 00:08:42,818
We've agreed I'd
take a year off before applying.

200
00:08:48,005 --> 00:08:49,339
I'm sorry.

201
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:51,026
A bit parched.

202
00:08:56,066 --> 00:08:59,807
I just... I just want this to be over.

203
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,836
It's just important
that you understand that...

204
00:09:03,607 --> 00:09:06,309
this would be a life-changing
event, the surgery,

205
00:09:06,334 --> 00:09:09,736
and could really shake up
your and Bria's routine,

206
00:09:09,761 --> 00:09:12,329
so it's very important that you...

207
00:09:12,354 --> 00:09:14,322
you have a postsurgical plan in place.

208
00:09:14,584 --> 00:09:17,119
I plan to keep doing
what I've been doing.

209
00:09:17,154 --> 00:09:19,021
Going solo has worked.

210
00:09:20,157 --> 00:09:22,191
I need to make sure it keeps working.

211
00:09:28,888 --> 00:09:30,723
What's the status
with the room change, Maggie?

212
00:09:30,757 --> 00:09:32,791
These guys next-door
to each other are like napalm.

213
00:09:32,826 --> 00:09:34,727
I'm working on it, Dr. Choi.

214
00:09:34,761 --> 00:09:36,395
Thanks.

215
00:09:43,676 --> 00:09:45,393
Hey, man. Where you headed?

216
00:09:46,339 --> 00:09:48,107
To grab a pop.

217
00:09:48,141 --> 00:09:50,851
Vending machine's
in the waiting room, that way.

218
00:09:51,564 --> 00:09:53,198
So that's how it's gonna be?

219
00:09:55,115 --> 00:09:56,379
Whatever.

220
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,615
Hey, don't let those ass-wipes
get to you.

221
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:08,585
Just trying to be tough guys.

222
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,377
No, Jeff.

223
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,674
It goes deeper.

224
00:10:13,824 --> 00:10:17,054
Not many families with the
last name Choi where I grew up.

225
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:18,780
Know the type all too well.

226
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,245
Dr. Manning, you're going to Trauma 3.

227
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,872
- Got it.
- Ted Baylor. 21-year-old male.

228
00:10:27,897 --> 00:10:29,231
Friends found him in his dorm room

229
00:10:29,256 --> 00:10:31,357
hooked up to the Xbox and unresponsive.

230
00:10:31,383 --> 00:10:33,885
Gave him fluids and oxygen in the field.

231
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:36,287
- Glucose level?
- Blood sugar's 800.

232
00:10:36,322 --> 00:10:37,222
That's sky-high.

233
00:10:37,256 --> 00:10:38,890
See the train kept rolling without me.

234
00:10:38,924 --> 00:10:41,226
Yep. Welcome back. We missed you.

235
00:10:42,895 --> 00:10:44,596
All right. On my count.

236
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,498
One, two, three.

237
00:10:48,701 --> 00:10:50,735
Mr. Baylor? Mr. Baylor?

238
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,360
- He's out. Sternal?
- Yep.

239
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:55,979
There he is.

240
00:10:56,014 --> 00:10:57,948
Mr. Baylor, do you know where you are?

241
00:10:57,982 --> 00:10:59,016
Hospital.

242
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,493
Okay. He's able to speak
and protect his airway.

243
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,154
Good breath sounds. Lungs are clear.

244
00:11:04,189 --> 00:11:05,956
Maintaining oxygen saturation.

245
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,157
All right, let's keep him on the O2,

246
00:11:07,192 --> 00:11:08,292
bolus another liter of fluid,

247
00:11:08,326 --> 00:11:09,393
and start an insulin drip.

248
00:11:09,427 --> 00:11:10,728
Labs?

249
00:11:10,762 --> 00:11:12,096
What do you think?

250
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,098
Likely diabetic ketoacidosis,

251
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,133
so, CBC, CMP, VBG,

252
00:11:16,167 --> 00:11:19,169
hemoglobin, A1-C, and another Accu-Chek.

253
00:11:19,204 --> 00:11:22,139
For cardiac, troponin and an EKG.

254
00:11:22,173 --> 00:11:23,774
Nice job.

255
00:11:26,711 --> 00:11:28,112
Help! Help!

256
00:11:28,137 --> 00:11:29,170
Something's wrong!

257
00:11:29,195 --> 00:11:31,062
I got it. What happened?

258
00:11:33,013 --> 00:11:34,046
What happened?

259
00:11:34,071 --> 00:11:36,072
He was talking,
and then his eyes rolled back.

260
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:37,988
I... I don't...

261
00:11:38,022 --> 00:11:39,311
Get a right away.

262
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:40,831
Got a pulse,
but he can't protect his airway.

263
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,166
We need to intubate. Draw up meds.

264
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,159
20 of etomidate, 100 of sux.

265
00:11:44,803 --> 00:11:47,238
- Is he gonna be okay?
- We'll see.

266
00:11:52,644 --> 00:11:54,311
Hold the meds.

267
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,433
Don't need them. No gag reflex.

268
00:11:57,315 --> 00:11:59,250
I'm in. Bag him.

269
00:11:59,284 --> 00:12:01,685
Let's get an OG tube down
to decompress his stomach.

270
00:12:03,655 --> 00:12:05,589
- Pupil's blown.
- Must have a head bleed.

271
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:07,791
Page neurosurgery.
We need a stat head CT.

272
00:12:24,394 --> 00:12:25,595
Hi.

273
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:27,622
Dr. Manning, I presume?

274
00:12:27,657 --> 00:12:29,432
I know. Corny.

275
00:12:29,466 --> 00:12:32,902
A little. But making jokes?
Feeling better?

276
00:12:33,395 --> 00:12:34,362
Compared to before?

277
00:12:34,396 --> 00:12:37,401
I mean, it still feels
like I got hit by a truck.

278
00:12:37,761 --> 00:12:39,128
What happened?

279
00:12:39,162 --> 00:12:41,130
Your body wasn't producing
enough insulin

280
00:12:41,164 --> 00:12:42,765
to control your blood sugar,

281
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:44,800
so it spiked and it knocked you out.

282
00:12:44,835 --> 00:12:47,136
- Is it diabetes?
- Yes.

283
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:48,337
Ugh.

284
00:12:48,371 --> 00:12:50,005
But the crisis period is over.

285
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,812
Your blood sugar levels are improving.

286
00:12:55,846 --> 00:12:57,219
You okay?

287
00:12:57,681 --> 00:12:59,649
It's just a little tender.

288
00:12:59,674 --> 00:13:01,375
Do you mind if I take a look?

289
00:13:07,157 --> 00:13:08,691
Oh!

290
00:13:08,725 --> 00:13:10,159
Pain scale, one to ten?

291
00:13:10,193 --> 00:13:11,360
12.

292
00:13:11,394 --> 00:13:12,704
Okay.

293
00:13:13,463 --> 00:13:14,997
How long has your stomach been hurting?

294
00:13:15,031 --> 00:13:16,432
A few days.

295
00:13:16,466 --> 00:13:18,033
I mean, it's winter break.

296
00:13:18,068 --> 00:13:22,438
Just more cheap beer and pizza
than usual.

297
00:13:22,472 --> 00:13:24,006
I figured it was just indigestion.

298
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,775
Is it the diabetes?

299
00:13:26,903 --> 00:13:28,035
No.

300
00:13:29,412 --> 00:13:30,946
Gallstones.

301
00:13:32,622 --> 00:13:34,784
I would like to run
some additional blood tests

302
00:13:34,818 --> 00:13:36,152
and get an MRCP,

303
00:13:36,186 --> 00:13:38,252
a more detailed scan
of your stomach, okay?

304
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:39,886
- Mm-hmm.
- Is there anyone

305
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,154
I can call for you?

306
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:42,455
No. My dad's on his way.

307
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:43,489
All right.

308
00:13:43,524 --> 00:13:45,104
He had them.

309
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:47,505
Gallstones.

310
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:50,129
They're a fat person's problem,
aren't they?

311
00:13:50,388 --> 00:13:52,565
They are often tied to obesity.

312
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,300
Diabetes as well.

313
00:13:54,335 --> 00:13:56,135
But, you know, with lifestyle changes,

314
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,837
these things are manageable.

315
00:13:57,871 --> 00:14:00,907
You mean like diet and exercise?

316
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:02,275
You're only 21.

317
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:03,576
It'd be easier than you think.

318
00:14:04,252 --> 00:14:05,478
I'll be back shortly.

319
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:31,537
Massive hemorrhaging in his brain.

320
00:14:31,572 --> 00:14:33,973
Trying to get the swelling
under control.

321
00:14:34,008 --> 00:14:35,792
Decompressive craniectomy.

322
00:14:35,817 --> 00:14:37,985
Opening up the skull
should relieve the pressure.

323
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,377
Yeah, but right before
they put him under,

324
00:14:39,402 --> 00:14:41,136
he had a Cushing's reflex.

325
00:14:41,415 --> 00:14:42,615
Dropped his heart rate,

326
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,585
and his BP went through the roof.

327
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:46,686
Hang in, man.

328
00:14:57,318 --> 00:14:59,152
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

329
00:15:01,702 --> 00:15:03,039
All right, I'll check.

330
00:15:03,564 --> 00:15:05,132
Sure. Uh-huh.

331
00:15:07,368 --> 00:15:08,976
Everything okay?

332
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,972
Yeah. Why wouldn't it be?

333
00:15:12,006 --> 00:15:14,541
So, uh... so, Meghan Scott.

334
00:15:14,575 --> 00:15:17,239
I got to say I have some reservations.

335
00:15:17,912 --> 00:15:20,313
But she's three years sober
and committed to staying clean.

336
00:15:20,348 --> 00:15:22,949
Yeah. Without a plan
or strategy to avoid relapse.

337
00:15:22,984 --> 00:15:25,952
Addiction is never conquered.
Only managed.

338
00:15:25,987 --> 00:15:28,321
But she's got a support system
in her daughter.

339
00:15:28,356 --> 00:15:29,656
Bria's involved.

340
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:30,857
Maybe too involved.

341
00:15:30,891 --> 00:15:32,525
I mean, by delaying college,

342
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,728
she is valuating
her mother's life over her own,

343
00:15:34,762 --> 00:15:36,896
and as admirable as that may seem,

344
00:15:36,931 --> 00:15:38,331
it just doesn't tend to last.

345
00:15:38,366 --> 00:15:40,533
Meghan's sick. It makes sense

346
00:15:40,568 --> 00:15:41,735
that she'd want to take care of her.

347
00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:45,905
There's a very fine line
between a healthy support system

348
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,574
and an unhealthy dependence.

349
00:15:47,608 --> 00:15:50,243
I mean, did you see
during the evaluation

350
00:15:50,277 --> 00:15:53,913
Meghan needed her daughter's
help to reach a glass of water

351
00:15:53,948 --> 00:15:56,880
that was literally
right in front of her?

352
00:15:57,644 --> 00:15:59,512
Look, it's a gut-wrenching process,

353
00:15:59,537 --> 00:16:01,738
and we just have to remember

354
00:16:01,763 --> 00:16:04,998
that we give Meghan a heart,

355
00:16:05,023 --> 00:16:07,325
we could be denying one
to somebody who is

356
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,751
just as deserving

357
00:16:09,063 --> 00:16:11,331
and might have
a better chance of success.

358
00:16:11,365 --> 00:16:14,279
So Meghan's a no?

359
00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:15,945
No, I didn't say that.

360
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:17,067
I just...

361
00:16:18,626 --> 00:16:20,527
I just want to sit with it
a little longer.

362
00:16:21,802 --> 00:16:23,015
Okay.

363
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:27,436
That gallbladder's really inflamed.

364
00:16:27,471 --> 00:16:28,637
It's full of stones.

365
00:16:28,672 --> 00:16:29,972
But it doesn't look
like any have dropped

366
00:16:30,006 --> 00:16:31,073
into the common bile duct.

367
00:16:31,108 --> 00:16:33,275
Oh, but it's only a matter
of time before one does

368
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:34,543
and causes a major obstruction.

369
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:35,478
Right.

370
00:16:35,512 --> 00:16:37,713
Well, play it safe,
remove the gallbladder?

371
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:39,648
Yes, except his latest labs.

372
00:16:39,683 --> 00:16:42,451
Calcium's low.
Amylase, lipase, white cells

373
00:16:42,486 --> 00:16:43,749
are all through the roof.

374
00:16:44,454 --> 00:16:46,555
Gallstone pancreatitis. Man.

375
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,469
The swelling is really bad.

376
00:16:51,575 --> 00:16:54,443
Right now I think we should
up his IV fluids

377
00:16:54,468 --> 00:16:56,602
and start a course of IV nutrition.

378
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:58,100
Should buy him a few days,

379
00:16:58,135 --> 00:16:59,502
give his pancreas time to cool off.

380
00:16:59,536 --> 00:17:00,683
Good idea. Good.

381
00:17:02,345 --> 00:17:04,046
What does this mean?

382
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,749
His pupils are nonreactive?

383
00:17:09,452 --> 00:17:11,286
The bleeding in Cyrus's brain

384
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,155
has caused significant injury.

385
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:15,736
Despite the surgeon's best efforts,

386
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:19,661
Cyrus has slipped into
a persistent vegetative state.

387
00:17:19,695 --> 00:17:21,363
A coma?

388
00:17:26,202 --> 00:17:29,004
But he can wake up, no?

389
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:30,305
It's possible?

390
00:17:33,042 --> 00:17:35,410
I'm sorry, but it's
more likely he stays like this

391
00:17:35,445 --> 00:17:37,212
or devolves to brain death.

392
00:17:38,408 --> 00:17:39,976
That referee...

393
00:17:40,056 --> 00:17:41,723
he should've stopped the fight earlier.

394
00:17:41,748 --> 00:17:42,614
Cyrus was dominant.

395
00:17:42,892 --> 00:17:45,633
The crowd... they cheered for blood.

396
00:17:46,597 --> 00:17:49,352
They wanted to see
the Muslim boy get killed.

397
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,907
- Hey.
- Hey.

398
00:18:07,942 --> 00:18:10,944
Oh! All bundled up?

399
00:18:10,978 --> 00:18:13,947
You... you realize
your pilomotor reflex is

400
00:18:13,981 --> 00:18:15,482
the first step towards frostbite?

401
00:18:15,516 --> 00:18:16,616
Yeah. Something like that.

402
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:19,088
So you know, I've been sitting
on this for a while now,

403
00:18:19,122 --> 00:18:21,655
and, uh, it might sound silly,

404
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:24,924
but I believe if couples are
good travel partners,

405
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:28,795
then they have what it takes
to have a future.

406
00:18:29,617 --> 00:18:30,817
So what do you think?

407
00:18:30,852 --> 00:18:34,354
New Orleans? Drinks, food, music.

408
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,465
I...

409
00:18:40,499 --> 00:18:43,501
"I sometimes imagine
it was the other way around:

410
00:18:43,535 --> 00:18:46,229
that Lisa was your wife
and Natalie was mine."

411
00:18:47,105 --> 00:18:48,406
What are you talking about?

412
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,140
I said that to Jeff.

413
00:18:50,742 --> 00:18:51,843
That's why we all lost touch.

414
00:18:51,877 --> 00:18:53,711
He didn't want us to hang out anymore.

415
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,427
I don't understand.

416
00:18:56,849 --> 00:18:59,150
Right when Lisa and I
started to go sideways,

417
00:18:59,184 --> 00:19:01,419
you and Jeff met me out at Twin Anchors

418
00:19:01,453 --> 00:19:02,529
for moral support.

419
00:19:02,564 --> 00:19:03,723
Yeah. I remember.

420
00:19:04,325 --> 00:19:06,293
You were up at the bar ordering a round,

421
00:19:06,327 --> 00:19:08,295
and I was looking at you,
and I just said it.

422
00:19:08,329 --> 00:19:09,579
Why?

423
00:19:10,465 --> 00:19:12,432
'Cause my marriage was falling apart

424
00:19:12,467 --> 00:19:13,267
and I was a little bit drunk,

425
00:19:13,301 --> 00:19:15,707
and right at that moment, it was true.

426
00:19:16,671 --> 00:19:19,172
Jeff, of course, flipped out,

427
00:19:19,207 --> 00:19:20,641
and I mean, if you weren't there,

428
00:19:20,675 --> 00:19:21,942
it might've gotten ugly.

429
00:19:21,976 --> 00:19:23,683
And you're just telling me this now?

430
00:19:23,724 --> 00:19:25,425
I know. I should've told you
this morning when you asked.

431
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:26,731
This morning?

432
00:19:27,382 --> 00:19:29,349
How about when you showed up
as a med student?

433
00:19:29,374 --> 00:19:31,074
Or before we slept together,

434
00:19:31,099 --> 00:19:33,092
or before I let you into my life?

435
00:19:33,921 --> 00:19:35,589
Unbelievable.

436
00:19:44,048 --> 00:19:45,148
Hi.

437
00:19:45,183 --> 00:19:46,717
Setting up grocery delivery.

438
00:19:46,751 --> 00:19:48,318
Farewell, supermarket temptations.

439
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,886
Well, that's a good first step.

440
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:51,021
- Mm-hmm.
- You know there's some great

441
00:19:51,055 --> 00:19:52,356
apps for tracking calories too.

442
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:54,391
That's way down the line. I mean,

443
00:19:54,425 --> 00:19:57,160
after I get a handle on GMOs, gluten,

444
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:58,929
organic versus farm-fresh.

445
00:19:58,963 --> 00:20:01,398
I... it's why I like fast food.
It's simple.

446
00:20:01,432 --> 00:20:02,733
You know what? Why don't I page

447
00:20:02,767 --> 00:20:04,034
the hospital's nutritionist,

448
00:20:04,068 --> 00:20:05,335
have her come in for a consult?

449
00:20:07,638 --> 00:20:09,206
You okay?

450
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,073
I've just been feeling

451
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:12,275
a little bit short of breath, and...

452
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,211
Just come on now?

453
00:20:14,245 --> 00:20:16,296
A couple minutes ago.

454
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:19,042
Is it a reaction to all the meds, or...

455
00:20:19,067 --> 00:20:21,135
No. They're just sparking
your immune system.

456
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,161
It shouldn't affect your breathing.

457
00:20:23,454 --> 00:20:25,188
Sit up for me?

458
00:20:31,495 --> 00:20:34,130
Lungs are clear.
Is the extra oxygen helping?

459
00:20:34,155 --> 00:20:35,922
No, not really.

460
00:20:35,947 --> 00:20:38,206
Will? Will, I need a hand.

461
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:41,091
Stat portable chest X-ray.

462
00:20:41,145 --> 00:20:42,745
- What's going on?
- Blood sugar's normal.

463
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:45,104
White cells, amylase, lipase...
they're all down.

464
00:20:45,129 --> 00:20:47,197
Everything's good,
except now he can't breathe.

465
00:20:47,222 --> 00:20:48,322
What's happening?

466
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:51,216
Your blood pressure
and oxygen levels keep dropping,

467
00:20:51,241 --> 00:20:52,909
so we're gonna take a chest X-ray

468
00:20:52,934 --> 00:20:54,501
to try to figure out why.

469
00:21:00,077 --> 00:21:01,945
Mass in the lung.

470
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,334
I'm hearing a rub.

471
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:09,635
It wasn't there before.

472
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:10,970
All right. Let's get an echo.

473
00:21:11,004 --> 00:21:12,037
I can't breathe.

474
00:21:12,072 --> 00:21:14,673
O2 keeps dropping.
Switching to a full face mask.

475
00:21:20,747 --> 00:21:22,848
Pericardial effusion.

476
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:23,882
What does that mean?

477
00:21:23,917 --> 00:21:24,817
Keep this on.

478
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:26,619
There's fluid built up
around your heart.

479
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:27,987
It's constricting it from beating.

480
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:29,655
Bolus another liter of fluid.

481
00:21:29,689 --> 00:21:31,538
Get 125mg Solu-Medrol IV

482
00:21:31,572 --> 00:21:32,992
and a Levophed drip. Yes, Doctor.

483
00:21:33,026 --> 00:21:34,326
Page Dr. Rhodes. We need

484
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:35,872
to tap this fluid off his heart.

485
00:21:36,696 --> 00:21:38,297
Five minutes ago he was getting better,

486
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:39,898
and now he's sicker
than when he came in.

487
00:22:05,594 --> 00:22:07,061
Okay.

488
00:22:13,608 --> 00:22:15,876
So the fluid's from acute pericarditis.

489
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,878
Stemming from the mass in his lungs.

490
00:22:17,912 --> 00:22:18,945
Drain's a temporary fix,

491
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,248
but his heart is really struggling.

492
00:22:21,282 --> 00:22:24,017
CT chest will show
exactly what we're dealing with.

493
00:22:25,286 --> 00:22:26,787
He presented with hyperglycemia

494
00:22:26,821 --> 00:22:28,755
and gallstone pancreatitis.

495
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:32,014
There was absolutely no evidence
of a heart problem.

496
00:22:32,794 --> 00:22:34,928
My time with Dr. Downey, now Dr. Latham

497
00:22:34,962 --> 00:22:36,763
the one constant:

498
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:39,399
cardiac events can strike
without warning.

499
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,770
Thought he was on the mend.

500
00:22:43,805 --> 00:22:45,772
So did I.

501
00:22:45,807 --> 00:22:48,275
Look. About earlier...

502
00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:49,776
- Dr. Manning?
- Yeah?

503
00:22:49,811 --> 00:22:51,812
Ted's father has arrived.

504
00:22:51,846 --> 00:22:52,879
I can fill him in.

505
00:22:52,914 --> 00:22:54,781
No. I'll do it.

506
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,054
Hi. Dr. Manning.

507
00:23:16,003 --> 00:23:17,904
Okay.

508
00:23:17,939 --> 00:23:19,339
Hard part's done.

509
00:23:19,373 --> 00:23:20,841
Big muscle bleeder down deep.

510
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,776
Stick tying it now.

511
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:33,067
The A-rab,

512
00:23:34,055 --> 00:23:35,858
Cyrus.

513
00:23:37,024 --> 00:23:39,993
You wheeled him out of here,
but he never came back.

514
00:23:40,027 --> 00:23:41,723
What happened?

515
00:23:43,836 --> 00:23:44,836
Turn for the worse.

516
00:23:45,611 --> 00:23:47,934
He knew the risk
when he stepped inside the cage.

517
00:23:49,275 --> 00:23:50,971
It's the cost of doing business.

518
00:23:53,908 --> 00:23:55,876
Shower and change the dressing
every day.

519
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,978
It'll take at least two
to three weeks to heal.

520
00:24:00,715 --> 00:24:02,449
Pack the wound.

521
00:24:03,885 --> 00:24:05,786
Get him out of here.

522
00:24:07,421 --> 00:24:09,456
<i>Bulky, swollen lymph nodes</i>

523
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,892
<i>and a clear primary mass</i>

524
00:24:11,926 --> 00:24:13,860
in the right lower lobe of the lung.

525
00:24:13,895 --> 00:24:16,029
Non-small cell lung cancer?

526
00:24:16,063 --> 00:24:18,064
The biopsy results are pending,

527
00:24:18,099 --> 00:24:21,434
but I'm almost certain
they'll confirm it.

528
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:24,838
I'm gonna talk to Dr. Latham
about surgical options.

529
00:24:24,872 --> 00:24:26,840
All right. I'll consult with oncology,

530
00:24:26,874 --> 00:24:27,908
get their opinion as well.

531
00:24:27,942 --> 00:24:29,376
Yeah.

532
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:31,044
Hey. Sorry, Nat.

533
00:24:31,078 --> 00:24:32,879
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

534
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:36,817
Hey, Dr. Charles.

535
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:39,052
Um, speak with you a second?

536
00:24:39,086 --> 00:24:40,720
- What's up?
- Yeah, so, my...

537
00:24:40,755 --> 00:24:41,922
my heart patient Meghan Scott...

538
00:24:41,956 --> 00:24:43,723
I hadn't heard anything,

539
00:24:43,758 --> 00:24:46,893
so is there something going on
with the transplant eval?

540
00:24:46,928 --> 00:24:48,395
Well, I know you know
that we're not supposed

541
00:24:48,429 --> 00:24:50,697
to be talking about this,
but unofficially,

542
00:24:50,731 --> 00:24:53,433
her history of addiction
makes her very high risk.

543
00:24:53,467 --> 00:24:55,035
Wh... I understand her history,

544
00:24:55,069 --> 00:24:58,705
but we're talking about her future here.

545
00:24:58,739 --> 00:25:00,622
Well, her future's precisely the issue.

546
00:25:01,943 --> 00:25:03,410
I'm sorry, Dr. Rhodes, but the...

547
00:25:03,444 --> 00:25:04,845
the clearance process...
it's unforgiving.

548
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:06,513
No, no, no, no.
Dr. Charles, you spent what?

549
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:08,882
All of an hour with her?

550
00:25:08,916 --> 00:25:10,550
I've known Meghan and her daughter Bria

551
00:25:10,585 --> 00:25:11,585
for months now.

552
00:25:11,619 --> 00:25:13,920
You've known her
within a controlled environment.

553
00:25:13,955 --> 00:25:15,222
The invasive surgery,

554
00:25:15,256 --> 00:25:17,424
the powerful opiates
for pain management,

555
00:25:17,458 --> 00:25:19,092
the rigorous medication schedule,

556
00:25:19,126 --> 00:25:20,026
the constant check-ups

557
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:22,062
to make sure she's
not rejecting the organ.

558
00:25:22,096 --> 00:25:24,231
So you're gonna seal her fate
with a checklist, then?

559
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,700
She doesn't get a heart, she dies.

560
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:28,935
She's looking at six months,
maybe a year.

561
00:25:29,312 --> 00:25:31,856
Do you honestly think
that I don't know that?

562
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,876
Someone's got to make the tough
decisions here, Dr. Rhodes.

563
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,944
I'd thank you to let me do my job.

564
00:25:46,153 --> 00:25:48,822
Amniotic fluid level looks okay.

565
00:25:48,856 --> 00:25:51,591
Same with nuchal translucency.

566
00:25:51,626 --> 00:25:54,794
Fetal heart rate is 180,
nice and strong.

567
00:25:54,829 --> 00:25:56,997
Aw, yeah, that's a boy.

568
00:25:57,031 --> 00:26:00,133
What's up, little man? Already
looking like a linebacker.

569
00:26:00,167 --> 00:26:03,536
Um, she looks like a scientist to me.

570
00:26:06,274 --> 00:26:08,541
Dr. Lee? Something wrong?

571
00:26:10,177 --> 00:26:13,013
At 12 weeks,
optimal crown chin length is

572
00:26:13,047 --> 00:26:14,147
26 millimeters.

573
00:26:14,181 --> 00:26:15,982
Your fetal measurement is 23.

574
00:26:16,017 --> 00:26:18,285
Is that still within the normal range?

575
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:19,920
Yes, but on the low end.

576
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:21,187
Something we need to keep an eye on.

577
00:26:21,573 --> 00:26:23,924
Low measurement... what does it mean?

578
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:26,159
The main concern is anencephaly,

579
00:26:26,193 --> 00:26:28,862
a neural tube defect
that can cause the brain

580
00:26:28,896 --> 00:26:30,254
to develop abnormally.

581
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:33,533
Is it because of my TB meds?

582
00:26:33,567 --> 00:26:36,236
Possibly. We can't really know for sure.

583
00:26:44,249 --> 00:26:46,070
TShe said the TB meds could

584
00:26:46,095 --> 00:26:47,665
possibly be affecting the baby.

585
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:48,657
That doesn't mean...

586
00:26:48,697 --> 00:26:50,093
I know.

587
00:26:51,053 --> 00:26:52,357
But what if they are?

588
00:26:53,702 --> 00:26:55,269
You can't stop taking them.

589
00:26:55,304 --> 00:26:59,046
So, where does that leave us?

590
00:26:59,475 --> 00:27:01,948
Look. You're 12 weeks.

591
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,978
If we're considering...

592
00:27:04,012 --> 00:27:05,035
We're not.

593
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,076
April,

594
00:27:06,101 --> 00:27:07,753
it's not what I want either,

595
00:27:07,983 --> 00:27:09,984
but if your health is in question,

596
00:27:10,018 --> 00:27:12,520
the quality of life of our baby
is threatened, I...

597
00:27:13,388 --> 00:27:15,623
we need to understand

598
00:27:15,657 --> 00:27:18,359
this gets riskier, more complicated

599
00:27:18,393 --> 00:27:19,994
after 14 weeks.

600
00:27:20,028 --> 00:27:22,630
Tate, I am Catholic.

601
00:27:22,664 --> 00:27:24,565
April, it's my baby too.

602
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,400
Don't I at least get to discuss this?

603
00:27:26,435 --> 00:27:29,337
We are not terminating this pregnancy.

604
00:27:36,545 --> 00:27:39,247
So how long would I have
to do chemo for?

605
00:27:39,281 --> 00:27:41,382
That's up to the oncologist.

606
00:27:41,416 --> 00:27:44,385
Generally, it's given in cycles
between one and four weeks long

607
00:27:44,419 --> 00:27:45,686
followed by a period of rest.

608
00:27:45,721 --> 00:27:47,688
How many cycles?

609
00:27:47,723 --> 00:27:50,691
One average, four to six.

610
00:27:50,726 --> 00:27:53,661
What about side effects?
The Internet lists thousands.

611
00:27:53,695 --> 00:27:55,997
It all depends on how Ted's body reacts.

612
00:27:56,031 --> 00:27:58,533
But yes, the side effects can add up.

613
00:27:58,567 --> 00:28:01,402
And because of the
gallstone pancreatitis,

614
00:28:01,436 --> 00:28:03,371
they may even be exacerbated.

615
00:28:04,501 --> 00:28:06,607
Well, all of this sounds awful.

616
00:28:06,642 --> 00:28:09,343
Um, what am I looking at with surgery?

617
00:28:09,378 --> 00:28:11,512
Removal of the mass via thoracotomy.

618
00:28:11,547 --> 00:28:15,016
I'll open your chest
and peel away the growth

619
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:16,684
from whatever it's attached to.

620
00:28:16,932 --> 00:28:19,620
But my pancreatitis...
a few... a few hours ago

621
00:28:19,655 --> 00:28:21,422
it was too dicey
for gallbladder surgery.

622
00:28:21,456 --> 00:28:23,024
How is it okay with all of this?

623
00:28:23,058 --> 00:28:25,092
Your cardiac function is compromised.

624
00:28:25,427 --> 00:28:28,363
Preventing heart failure has
to be our chief concern.

625
00:28:29,097 --> 00:28:30,731
Dad, I don't know what I'm gonna do.

626
00:28:30,766 --> 00:28:33,434
I feel like if I make the wrong
decision right now

627
00:28:33,468 --> 00:28:35,844
I'm gonna... I'm gonna die.

628
00:28:36,352 --> 00:28:38,152
Do you need an answer right now?

629
00:28:38,177 --> 00:28:42,080
Ted, look, I understand
this is all overwhelming,

630
00:28:42,143 --> 00:28:43,510
but you're very sick.

631
00:28:43,745 --> 00:28:45,746
The sooner we start fighting back...

632
00:28:45,781 --> 00:28:47,615
Emergency radiation.

633
00:28:47,649 --> 00:28:51,385
Yeah, a single dose intended
only to stabilize

634
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,486
the mass in your lung.

635
00:28:52,521 --> 00:28:55,156
It'll give the pancreatitis
a few more days to heal,

636
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:57,158
and it'll give you and your dad
more time

637
00:28:57,192 --> 00:28:58,726
to decide on a treatment.

638
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,728
And if I still choose surgery after,

639
00:29:00,762 --> 00:29:02,396
it'll be safer, right?

640
00:29:02,431 --> 00:29:03,831
Theoretically, yes.

641
00:29:03,865 --> 00:29:06,834
When can I do it? The radiation.

642
00:29:06,868 --> 00:29:10,571
Today. I will set it up
with the radiation oncologist.

643
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:18,779
You gonna just stand there staring,

644
00:29:18,814 --> 00:29:19,973
or are you gonna come in?

645
00:29:20,007 --> 00:29:23,316
I can't get this frickin'
coffee ring off of...

646
00:29:24,686 --> 00:29:26,028
what's on your mind?

647
00:29:26,475 --> 00:29:28,276
I know you have reservations,

648
00:29:28,301 --> 00:29:29,601
but I've been reading

649
00:29:29,626 --> 00:29:31,894
about how others have managed addiction

650
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,680
in unorthodox ways.

651
00:29:34,663 --> 00:29:37,431
There's meditation.
Meghan already does that.

652
00:29:37,466 --> 00:29:39,367
Predicting your weak spots.

653
00:29:39,401 --> 00:29:42,503
She's cut off friends
that were bad influences.

654
00:29:42,537 --> 00:29:43,804
The problem with these techniques is

655
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:45,673
that they're all solo endeavors.

656
00:29:45,707 --> 00:29:48,348
What Meghan needs is the support
of a sober community.

657
00:29:48,373 --> 00:29:50,441
But she's been successful without one.

658
00:29:50,646 --> 00:29:51,846
And she's got Bria,

659
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,648
all the reason in the world
to stay sober.

660
00:29:53,682 --> 00:29:55,216
Won't be enough.

661
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:58,152
I've been treating addiction
for over 20 years.

662
00:29:58,186 --> 00:30:02,657
And trust me. I know of what I speak.

663
00:30:03,081 --> 00:30:06,794
My brother lost his battle with
addiction about 14 years ago.

664
00:30:08,764 --> 00:30:10,206
I am sorry.

665
00:30:10,699 --> 00:30:13,834
I want Meghan to succeed
just as badly as you do.

666
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:17,490
But I look at her, and I...

667
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,393
I see my little brother.

668
00:30:21,276 --> 00:30:24,330
He tried to do it solo too.
It just doesn't work.

669
00:30:25,681 --> 00:30:27,682
And I can't in good conscience
recommend her

670
00:30:27,716 --> 00:30:29,152
to the Transplant Committee

671
00:30:29,444 --> 00:30:33,014
without one good, solid, clinical reason

672
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,274
that might give her a chance to succeed.

673
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:39,035
I've been looking for it.
Just... I just can't find it.

674
00:30:42,698 --> 00:30:44,332
Okay.

675
00:30:53,909 --> 00:30:56,811
Hey. Okay to discharge
the asthmatic in Treatment 2?

676
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,849
Yeah. Prednisone and albuterol
scrips are with the clerk.

677
00:31:03,552 --> 00:31:05,519
They've been going
for the last several hours,

678
00:31:05,554 --> 00:31:07,221
trading places.

679
00:31:08,623 --> 00:31:10,691
They believe prayer can bring him out.

680
00:31:19,554 --> 00:31:21,454
What are you doing over here?

681
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:23,175
I just, um...

682
00:31:24,573 --> 00:31:25,706
I'm not sure.

683
00:31:25,741 --> 00:31:27,308
You've been discharged. Go home.

684
00:31:27,342 --> 00:31:29,210
You're showing your face around here?

685
00:31:31,313 --> 00:31:32,880
Is he gonna wake up?

686
00:31:32,914 --> 00:31:35,816
Like you care.
You did this to him. Murderer!

687
00:31:35,851 --> 00:31:38,486
It's not my fault.
We b... we both wanted to win.

688
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,654
- Go home, Ricky.
- God will punish you.

689
00:31:40,689 --> 00:31:41,655
You will burn in hell!

690
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:43,290
Aamir!

691
00:31:44,593 --> 00:31:46,260
Enough.

692
00:31:58,974 --> 00:32:00,741
Come.

693
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:03,611
Pray with us.

694
00:32:06,615 --> 00:32:08,716
I'm s...

695
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:12,224
I'm sorry.

696
00:32:33,575 --> 00:32:35,609
- Dr. Halstead, a moment.
- Yeah?

697
00:32:35,644 --> 00:32:37,611
Dr. Manning's patient Ted Baylor...

698
00:32:37,646 --> 00:32:39,613
I understand surgery was proposed,

699
00:32:39,648 --> 00:32:41,816
but that radiation will be tried first.

700
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:43,684
As a short-term measure.

701
00:32:43,718 --> 00:32:45,619
Yeah, well, it's the size of the mass

702
00:32:45,654 --> 00:32:46,387
that's killing him.

703
00:32:46,421 --> 00:32:47,855
Radiation only stalls its growth.

704
00:32:47,889 --> 00:32:49,390
It doesn't... doesn't shrink it.

705
00:32:49,424 --> 00:32:51,058
Well, Dr. Manning's opinion and mine

706
00:32:51,092 --> 00:32:53,446
is that radiation is
a much safer option right now.

707
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:57,575
Well, you're the attending.
Keep me posted.

708
00:33:04,739 --> 00:33:08,642
Hey, Daniel, I haven't gotten
your report on Meghan Scott.

709
00:33:08,677 --> 00:33:09,810
How's it going?

710
00:33:09,845 --> 00:33:12,313
Still dotting the Is, crossing the Ts.

711
00:33:12,347 --> 00:33:14,582
You know, I know
these evaluations are difficult,

712
00:33:14,616 --> 00:33:17,017
but if you're looking for
something and not finding it,

713
00:33:17,052 --> 00:33:18,722
maybe it's not there.

714
00:33:19,754 --> 00:33:21,322
I said I'd have it for you
before the end of the day,

715
00:33:21,356 --> 00:33:22,475
and I will.

716
00:33:25,093 --> 00:33:26,827
Okay.

717
00:33:31,066 --> 00:33:32,833
From now on, clean nutrition,

718
00:33:32,868 --> 00:33:34,001
lots of cardio,

719
00:33:34,035 --> 00:33:35,836
diet and exercise.

720
00:33:35,871 --> 00:33:36,871
My dad, too.

721
00:33:36,905 --> 00:33:39,373
That's the enthusiasm
I was hoping to hear.

722
00:33:39,407 --> 00:33:41,108
I'm getting a second chance.

723
00:33:41,142 --> 00:33:43,010
I'm not wasting a day of it.

724
00:33:43,044 --> 00:33:45,012
Good for you.

725
00:33:46,748 --> 00:33:48,082
Okay, let's do this.

726
00:33:57,306 --> 00:33:59,207
Natalie, hey.

727
00:34:01,637 --> 00:34:04,482
I am so sorry that I didn't
say something sooner.

728
00:34:05,066 --> 00:34:07,101
I was afraid I'd lose you.

729
00:34:09,137 --> 00:34:11,005
Say something, please.

730
00:34:13,475 --> 00:34:17,199
I was terrified to move on from Jeff.

731
00:34:17,512 --> 00:34:19,747
Even more afraid
to get involved with you,

732
00:34:19,781 --> 00:34:22,262
my husband's best friend.

733
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,765
And yet I thought there is no one

734
00:34:24,986 --> 00:34:27,922
Jeff would approve of me being
in a relationship with

735
00:34:27,956 --> 00:34:29,123
more than you.

736
00:34:29,157 --> 00:34:30,724
And you let me think that.

737
00:34:30,759 --> 00:34:32,826
He's coding! I need help!

738
00:34:32,861 --> 00:34:34,762
- What happened?
- He just dropped.

739
00:34:34,796 --> 00:34:35,829
Take over compressions.

740
00:34:35,864 --> 00:34:37,831
- Got it. I got it. I got it.
- No pulse. V fib.

741
00:34:37,866 --> 00:34:39,500
- Charge 200.
- Charging.

742
00:34:42,103 --> 00:34:43,737
Hold compressions.

743
00:34:43,772 --> 00:34:45,139
Clear.

744
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:48,676
Resume compressions.

745
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,844
Another milligram epi. Charge to 300.

746
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,947
Charging.

747
00:34:52,981 --> 00:34:53,948
Hold compressions.

748
00:34:53,982 --> 00:34:55,482
Clear.

749
00:35:01,056 --> 00:35:02,756
Asystole.

750
00:35:06,347 --> 00:35:07,948
You gonna call it?

751
00:35:10,865 --> 00:35:13,601
Time of death 17:32.

752
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:48,838
He was dead before
the first alarm even went off.

753
00:35:48,872 --> 00:35:51,173
C.O.D. tumor lysis syndrome.

754
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:52,475
No way.

755
00:35:52,509 --> 00:35:55,544
You know, the radiation was
supposed to stabilize the mass.

756
00:35:55,579 --> 00:35:57,546
Instead it caused it to burst.

757
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,485
I might as well have just
given Ted a lethal injection,

758
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:04,487
because that is essentially
what happened.

759
00:36:04,521 --> 00:36:06,856
Natalie, this is not on you.

760
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:09,258
There are no predictors
for tumor lysis syndrome.

761
00:36:09,293 --> 00:36:11,160
It is monumentally rare...

762
00:36:11,194 --> 00:36:12,561
even more so in young people.

763
00:36:12,596 --> 00:36:14,563
And the few times that it does occur,

764
00:36:14,598 --> 00:36:16,932
overwhelmingly,
it's a reaction to chemo,

765
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:18,401
not radiation.

766
00:36:18,435 --> 00:36:20,202
It still feels like I missed something.

767
00:36:20,237 --> 00:36:21,604
Well, you didn't.

768
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:24,940
No doctor sees gallstone
pancreatitis with diabetes

769
00:36:24,975 --> 00:36:26,509
and thinks volatile
cancerous chest mass.

770
00:36:26,543 --> 00:36:28,153
And yet here it is.

771
00:36:36,586 --> 00:36:38,487
Ted's death is not your fault.

772
00:36:53,737 --> 00:36:56,005
You just get good news or bad news?

773
00:36:58,075 --> 00:36:59,865
My coma patient...

774
00:36:59,964 --> 00:37:02,599
this morning,
he mentioned a Qur'an verse:

775
00:37:02,946 --> 00:37:05,474
Surah Al shura 40.

776
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:09,318
"The recompense of an evil deed

777
00:37:09,353 --> 00:37:12,059
"can only be an evil equal to it;

778
00:37:13,317 --> 00:37:17,819
"but whoever pardons
and makes reconciliation,

779
00:37:18,628 --> 00:37:20,529
their reward is due from God."

780
00:37:25,035 --> 00:37:28,070
In the psych world,
it's called complementarity.

781
00:37:29,606 --> 00:37:31,474
You know, kindness begets kindness.

782
00:37:31,508 --> 00:37:33,439
Hostility, hostility.

783
00:37:34,644 --> 00:37:35,848
Yeah.

784
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:39,360
An hour ago, those two hated each other,

785
00:37:40,016 --> 00:37:42,451
but then his father extends a hand.

786
00:37:42,486 --> 00:37:44,620
Dr. Charles calls it
"flipping the script."

787
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:48,591
Don't know if I could've done it.

788
00:37:49,253 --> 00:37:51,921
Yeah. Not many people can.

789
00:38:22,692 --> 00:38:25,024
Okay, what is with you?

790
00:38:26,029 --> 00:38:28,130
No invitation to sit down?

791
00:38:28,165 --> 00:38:29,565
Usually I can't sneak past you.

792
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,333
I'm just a little preoccupied.

793
00:38:31,368 --> 00:38:35,004
I... I got to figure something out
fast, and I'm at a roadblock,

794
00:38:35,038 --> 00:38:36,338
and I can't find my way around it.

795
00:38:36,373 --> 00:38:38,474
Okay. I... I will leave you to it.

796
00:38:41,578 --> 00:38:43,262
Hey, uh,

797
00:38:43,747 --> 00:38:46,015
if you're going through hell,
keep going.

798
00:38:46,049 --> 00:38:47,716
Isn't that what you always taught me?

799
00:38:47,751 --> 00:38:50,486
Well, technically it was
Winston Churchill, but...

800
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,422
Well, still, it's never let me down.

801
00:38:53,457 --> 00:38:54,557
Hm.

802
00:38:54,591 --> 00:38:56,158
Good.

803
00:39:07,571 --> 00:39:09,572
Mom.

804
00:39:11,475 --> 00:39:12,708
You're recommending Meghan

805
00:39:12,742 --> 00:39:14,710
to the hospital's Transplant Committee.

806
00:39:14,744 --> 00:39:17,413
- Uh-huh.
- Well, what happened?

807
00:39:17,447 --> 00:39:20,516
Well, if you must know,

808
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,117
a member of my junior staff

809
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:24,620
drew my attention to the fact that, um,

810
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:27,723
I was so focused on her risk factors

811
00:39:27,757 --> 00:39:29,859
that I was blind
to the one personality trait

812
00:39:29,893 --> 00:39:33,462
that my late brother did not have.

813
00:39:33,497 --> 00:39:34,763
What?

814
00:39:34,798 --> 00:39:36,532
Grit.

815
00:39:36,566 --> 00:39:41,470
One's ability to persevere
in the face of obstacles...

816
00:39:41,505 --> 00:39:43,138
a clean clinical reason.

817
00:39:43,173 --> 00:39:45,074
I mean, the stressors are still there,

818
00:39:45,108 --> 00:39:47,076
as are significant future challenges,

819
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:49,578
but I like to think
that the determination

820
00:39:49,613 --> 00:39:51,881
that's kept her clean
the past three years

821
00:39:51,915 --> 00:39:54,550
is gonna help her go the distance.

822
00:39:54,584 --> 00:39:56,008
Mm-hmm.

823
00:39:58,374 --> 00:40:01,076
Hey, what made you think of grit?

824
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,794
Fatherhood.

825
00:40:13,436 --> 00:40:15,471
Rough one today, huh?

826
00:40:16,606 --> 00:40:17,673
To say the least.

827
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:18,874
Well, not to pile on,

828
00:40:18,909 --> 00:40:23,029
but Dr. Stohl just informed me
that he'd like to use you case

829
00:40:23,063 --> 00:40:25,781
for the next
Morbidity and Mortality Review,

830
00:40:25,815 --> 00:40:27,516
trace your steps.

831
00:40:27,551 --> 00:40:30,119
An M&M? Oh, my God.

832
00:40:30,153 --> 00:40:33,422
Well, it's not an inquisition.
It's just a learning tool

833
00:40:33,456 --> 00:40:34,657
for the medical staff.

834
00:40:34,691 --> 00:40:36,792
You tell Dr. Stohl that?

835
00:40:38,495 --> 00:40:39,862
Okay, night.

836
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:41,664
All righty. Good night.

837
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:57,680
What now?

838
00:40:57,714 --> 00:40:59,448
Can't kick me out of here too.

839
00:40:59,482 --> 00:41:01,517
I'm not here to do that.

840
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:04,687
I was thinking

841
00:41:04,721 --> 00:41:06,632
we got off to a rough start.

842
00:41:07,591 --> 00:41:09,458
Let me make it up to you.

843
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,815
Two beers. My tab.
