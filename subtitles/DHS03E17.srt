1
00:00:02,702 --> 00:00:05,500
Hey. Thanks.

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,473
No, no, no... Here.

3
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:10,602
You got this whole thing
wrong, Em.

4
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:14,238
It's the rock star that's
supposed to be late, not
the rock-star photographer.

5
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:17,442
Sorry. Morning sickness.
Touch the belly.

6
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:19,644
It's the first time
I've been asked to do that.

7
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,209
Come on. It's good luck.

8
00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:22,777
Okay.

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,624
Hit the Kinos behind the drop.

10
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:32,728
So what do you think?

11
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,563
I think people
aren't gonna get it.

12
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:37,865
Come on.
"All-American Rejects."

13
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:42,636
Juxtaposing a classic image
of Americana with
modern pop culture youth.

14
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:44,938
Oh, yeah.

15
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:47,411
Everyone loves
a good juxtaposition.

16
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,175
My fans were born in the '90s.

17
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:52,810
You know what?
You do this picture,
you'll gain 40 years of fans.

18
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:54,513
Yeah?
Yeah.

19
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:56,919
I love the Rockwell thing.
I thought so.

20
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,888
Okay. Kill the house lights.
Let's go!

21
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:09,032
Hang on. Hey, who's in charge
of the backdrop?

22
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:10,694
Naomi?
Yeah?

23
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:12,761
What's wrong with it?

24
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:15,438
Well, the words are
completely jumbled.

25
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,139
What, you can read that?

26
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:20,736
Of course.

27
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:23,446
You okay?
No. Oh, God.

28
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:25,507
I could be having a...

29
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:27,943
What's the mnemonic?

30
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,024
"F" is for face.
Is my smile crooked?

31
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,358
What are you doing?

32
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:37,055
"A" is for arms.

33
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,222
Arms.

34
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:39,595
You should really sit down.

35
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,156
Can someone
get her some water?

36
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:42,724
"S" is speech.

37
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:44,633
I'm slurring? I'm slurring?

38
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:49,871
"F-A-S-T."

39
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,271
"T" is for time.

40
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:56,839
Hurry. Somebody, call 911.
Tell them I'm having a stroke.

41
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,389
Hi. I'm Dr. House.

42
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:43,395
My boss says you're important.

43
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,320
Personally I don't get
what's so hard about

44
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:47,366
making Scarlett Johansson
look pretty.

45
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:48,923
Arms out in front of you.

46
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,266
Palms up like
you're holding a pizza.

47
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,203
Close your eyes.

48
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:57,639
It's so easy you should
consider a career change.

49
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,234
Probably make
a lot more money.

50
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,746
Dr. Mackman tell you
the clot was clear?

51
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:02,974
Yes.

52
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,044
And he said that you
and the fetus are fine?

53
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:06,210
Yeah.

54
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,445
He didn't mention
your pronator drift?

55
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:11,350
What's that mean?

56
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:13,517
Means Mackman is an idiot.

57
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,518
May I?
Yeah.

58
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:17,323
So,

59
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:20,596
you take thousands
of photos of someone,

60
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,965
but only one has to look good.

61
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,333
Kind of the opposite
of my business.

62
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:25,803
It's not about looking good.

63
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:26,964
People are always
hiding things.

64
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,498
I just keep shooting
until I can see what's
really inside them.

65
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:32,502
My eyes okay?

66
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:33,807
Eyes are gorgeous.

67
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,014
The vessels don't look so hot.

68
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:38,776
Microaneurysms predict
further strokes.

69
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:40,011
This is gonna happen again?

70
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:42,611
Unless I can figure out
the underlying cause.

71
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,452
Puff up your cheeks.

72
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:49,591
You should be able to
keep the air in. Means there's
weakness around the mouth.

73
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,493
So where'd you learn
to self-diagnose a stroke?

74
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:56,228
Oh, my baby's biological
father is a neurologist.

75
00:03:56,302 --> 00:04:00,033
He once told me the FAST
mnemonic could
save my life one day. So...

76
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:01,596
Interesting pet name.

77
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:04,968
Most people go with
"husband" or "pookie."

78
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:06,636
He's gay.

79
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,510
Just a sperm donor.
So when you...

80
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,310
You turned him
for a night?

81
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,146
Just straight for one date?

82
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,083
Okay.

83
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:18,084
He took a magazine and a cup
into my bathroom.

84
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:20,022
A man after my own heart.

85
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,993
Different magazine obviously.

86
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:24,925
I'm rescinding Mackman's
discharge order.

87
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,125
My lackeys will be in
to do some tests,

88
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,135
take some more blood
and empty your catheter bag.

89
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:38,738
Not a moment you'll
want to cherish.

90
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,043
This is definitely different.

91
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,278
It looks almost like...

92
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,181
He's caring.

93
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,527
Find anything else
in the patient's folder?
Like a diagnosis?

94
00:04:57,597 --> 00:05:00,998
Urinalysis revealed
excessive protein
and red blood cells.

95
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,729
Chem panel showed
a creatinine level over 2.5.

96
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:07,364
So first she strokes,
now her kidneys
are shutting down. Why?

97
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,271
Ultrasound showed
no tumors or stones.

98
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:12,072
No signs of fetal distress.
No urinary tract obstructions.

99
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,840
BP is fine. No pre-eclampsia.

100
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:16,279
Any of you guys
ever been to the Galápagos?

101
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:17,646
Was our patient there?

102
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:19,742
Dengue fever, avian pox,
even West Nile.

103
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:20,911
No.

104
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,648
I'm looking for
a vacation spot.

105
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:23,916
That mean we get vacation?

106
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,584
How would that differ
from your current status?

107
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:27,956
You're gonna do what? Relax?

108
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:29,255
Visiting family.

109
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,694
My uncle's a giant turtle.

110
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:32,856
What if the kidney failure
came first?

111
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:35,423
Kidneys could've
caused the stroke
not the other way around.

112
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,526
Kidneys don't often
get stuck in the brain.

113
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:38,934
I'm saying it threw a clot.

114
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,031
Early symptoms
of kidney failure are nausea,
vomiting, ankle swelling.

115
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,700
She would've mistaken it
for morning sickness.

116
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:46,108
Heart's way more likely
to throw a clot than a kidney.

117
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,307
Echo was normal.
The history indicates
no sign of cardiac problems.

118
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,543
No, but if one were to read
the history closely,

119
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:53,881
one would notice
that she had six cases
of strep.

120
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:57,013
In her throat.
That's the one about
10 inches above her heart.

121
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,718
Let me rephrase,
six cases of untreated strep.

122
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:01,191
She was
prescribed antibiotics.

123
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,454
No one takes them all.

124
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:05,691
They stop when they
start feeling better.
All strep is untreated strep.

125
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,392
What happens when
strep goes untreated?

126
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:08,695
Leads to rheumatic fever.

127
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,099
Which leads to... Cameron?

128
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:11,329
Mitral valve stenosis.

129
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:14,396
Which is a thickening
in the valve of the... Kidney?

130
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:15,566
No.

131
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:17,233
The kidney doesn't have
a mitral valve.

132
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,403
We'll go look at her heart.

133
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:22,580
Be easy to find.

134
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:26,175
It's the big red pumping thing
about 10 inches
below her throat.

135
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:28,451
That was weird.

136
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,650
He was the way he always is.

137
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,190
Which is weird.

138
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:35,394
Very still, Emma.
Sorry.

139
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:36,689
No problem.

140
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:39,789
He caught us with your hand
up my shirt. He's gotta have
a reaction to that.

141
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,333
You think that's what
the vacation is?

142
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,425
Yes.

143
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:45,960
The pain of losing you
is obviously forcing him away.

144
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:47,437
Coronal slice appears normal.

145
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,668
There's no way House
just lets this slide.

146
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,300
He's gotta be
planning something.

147
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:53,470
Maybe he just
doesn't give a crap.

148
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:54,808
Sagittal slice is clean.

149
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,473
You think he just
stumbled into that closet?

150
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:58,779
He knew we were there
and he wanted us to know
that he knew.

151
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:00,580
Or you wanted him to know.

152
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:03,713
Now he does and you're annoyed
because he doesn't care.

153
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,215
Right there.

154
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:08,385
Trans-axial slice.
Calcified mitral valve.
Barely.

155
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,190
That's not big enough
to throw a clot.

156
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,561
Obviously it is,
because it did.

157
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:13,997
House was right.

158
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:17,298
A valve in your heart
is narrowed.

159
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,134
It caused the clot
which lead to your stroke,

160
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:23,767
and the reduced circulation
caused the problem
with your kidneys.

161
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,470
And this will fix it?

162
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:28,878
The balloon will
force the valve back open
and you'll be fine.

163
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,540
EMMA: Can we do this without
a sedative?

164
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,585
It's very mild.
There really is no risk
to the fetus.

165
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:36,281
We'll monitor your baby's
heart rate separately.

166
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:39,722
We won't allow it to
decrease anywhere
near dangerous levels.

167
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:44,055
Thank you.

168
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,222
You're both gonna be fine.

169
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:49,691
Go ahead, Dr. Cameron.

170
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,498
Listen to that heartbeat.
It sounds so...

171
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:57,975
Start threading the catheter.

172
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:10,077
No, I don't want a layover
in Frankfurt, Taipei,
Singapore or London, Ontario.

173
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,522
That's why I asked
for a direct flight to
Phnom Penh.

174
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:15,959
How hard is it to not land?
Does it matter what I answer?

175
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:18,457
Well, then fine.
I'd be delighted to hold.

176
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:20,590
What's new?
Can you tell Cuddy
to stop interfering?

177
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,894
It's her job. What's new?

178
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:23,401
Good news is
Emma's heart is fixed.

179
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:26,802
Bad news is it's not her
underlying problem.
Her kidneys are still failing.

180
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,841
You're vacationing
in Cambodia?

181
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,933
You gonna unwind
in the Killing Fields?
Nope.

182
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,841
Gonna catch me
a fish this big.

183
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:35,437
Mekong giant catfish.
Weighs over 600 pounds.

184
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,039
Aren't those catfish
critically endangered?

185
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:38,811
That's why it's my last chance
to catch one.

186
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:40,079
<i>All of our operators</i>
<i>are currently...</i>

187
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:43,315
If the mitral valve had been
properly fixed the kidney
should be getting better,

188
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:45,983
which leads us to
the conclusion that you
screwed up the procedure.

189
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:47,423
Or you screwed up
the diagnosis.

190
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:49,188
The mitral valve thickening
was so insignificant

191
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,389
it probably wasn't the cause
of the kidneys or the stroke.

192
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:52,692
Probably never would've
been a problem.

193
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:55,393
She needs dialysis
and we need a new theory.

194
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:57,299
CHASE: There are only
a few possibilities.

195
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,531
Patient's pregnant,
could be pre-eclampsia.

196
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:00,936
We eliminated it
before because...

197
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:03,339
Re-check for proteinuria
and low platelets. What else?

198
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:04,501
Hypoperfusion.

199
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:07,978
The fetus is basically
a parasite stealing nutrients,
minerals, blood.

200
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,139
Put her on telemetry.

201
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,512
Or the pregnancy
is irrelevant.

202
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,313
Could be infection,
sepsis, HUSITTP.

203
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,377
CHASE: A cholesterol embolism
is just as likely.

204
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:18,855
Tiny particles of cholesterol
rain down, clog up the small
vessels of the kidneys.

205
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:21,120
Get a smear and ultrasound
her vessels for plaque.

206
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:22,854
That's it.
Has to be one of those five.

207
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:27,161
You know what would be
even better? If we'd narrow it
all the way down to one.

208
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:29,931
<i>Thank you for holding.</i>

209
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:32,596
<i>We are experiencing</i>
<i>extremely high call volume.</i>

210
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:34,799
<i>Thank you for your patience.</i>

211
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:41,974
She's 0 for five.

212
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:47,386
Either the differential
was wrong or she's faking it.

213
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:49,648
Kidney failure has to be
precipitated by...

214
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,189
One of the five
we've already ruled out.

215
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,782
The body only has so many ways
of screwing with the kidneys.

216
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:55,451
The labs must be wrong.
We did the labs.

217
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,155
No one else had access.

218
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:58,753
That's not quite true.

219
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:09,668
You put all your patients
through this many tests
or just the important ones?

220
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,277
We wanted to explore
all possibilities.

221
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:17,805
And?

222
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,849
We've eliminated
all the possibilities.

223
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,115
You telling me I'm dying
and you have no idea why?

224
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,214
Your body is
functioning properly.

225
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,849
So why are my kidneys failing?

226
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,591
The other body isn't.

227
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:34,527
There's something wrong
with the fetus.

228
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:47,609
Welcome to the world
of maternal mirror syndrome.

229
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,643
Mom's body is like

230
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:53,881
an intricate
German metro system.

231
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:55,784
All the trains run on time.

232
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:59,985
When she gets pregnant,
it's like a new station
opening in Düsseldorf.

233
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,887
Bunch or rookies
running things.
Bound to be mistakes.

234
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:05,226
Kids play on the tracks,
get electrocuted.

235
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:07,731
Before you know it,
the trains are backed up
all the way to Berlin

236
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,893
and you've got
a bunch of angry Germans
with nowhere to go.

237
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,834
And we all know
that ain't good for the Jews.

238
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:13,166
Who are the Jews
in this metaphor?

239
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,207
A few things can happen
to a fetus in distress.

240
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:17,538
It can become a miscarriage,
stillbirth,

241
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,875
a very sick baby
or on rare occasion
a time bomb

242
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,145
that kills mom
while it's dying.

243
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:26,275
Good news is,
we fix the fetus,
mom gets better.

244
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,445
It's the diagnostic equivalent
of a two-for-one sale.

245
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,786
I have read the outcome
of mirror syndrome
is almost always unfavorable.

246
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,724
"Unfavorable."
Is that doctor speak
for "dead baby"?

247
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:37,559
You think she'll be less upset
if you phrase it nicely?

248
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,825
We can tell her the truth,
that she'll be fine

249
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:43,665
as soon as we diagnose
a person who weighs
about one pound.

250
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:47,433
Can't touch it,
can't ask where it hurts,
can't see it.

251
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:51,442
If only there existed
giant machines that could
look through human skin.

252
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,035
Mirror syndrome
has a limited number
of known causes.

253
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:56,775
Tachyarrhythmia, fetal anemia,
placental chorioangioma.

254
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:59,044
All of which are fixable.

255
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:00,881
Which would be
un-unfavorable, right?

256
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:02,716
Could also be trisomy 13.

257
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:05,586
Ebstein's anomaly,
an aneurysm of Galen's vein.

258
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:09,287
And Dr. Storm Cloud
rained all over
the differential

259
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:11,192
and killed
the beautiful little baby.

260
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:14,460
Heart's easiest to see,
easiest to fix.
So let's start there.

261
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:17,058
When you did Mom's MRI,
did you get a look
at the fetus's heart?

262
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:20,537
It was in the range
but blurry. The fetus
was moving all over the place.

263
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,403
So we need another scan.
Yeah.

264
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:25,137
We'll just ask the fetus
to lie very, very still.

265
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:27,975
No need. I'm going to
paralyze it.

266
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:33,117
You wanna paralyze
Emma Sloan's baby?

267
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:35,179
Let me guess. Cameron?

268
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,313
Cameron and Chase
both had their concerns.

269
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:39,050
No, Cameron had concerns.

270
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,183
Chase just agreed with her

271
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,251
because he didn't want to lose
his all-access pass
to her love rug.

272
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,591
They're sleeping together?

273
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:47,928
If by "sleeping together"
you mean having sex
in the janitor's closet.

274
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,126
Here?

275
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:51,769
No, the janitor's closet
at the local high school.

276
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:53,634
Go, Tiger Cats!

277
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,669
Do you have one of those
camera phones? 'Cause I got
a MySpace account.

278
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:58,835
I will deal with them
after I deal with you.

279
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:00,538
Oh, come on.
Let's gossip some more.

280
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,274
I'm sure she's into bondage.

281
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:04,714
Paralyzing a one-pound baby
risks damaging...

282
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:08,220
Not paralyzing the thing
risks not getting
a clean MRI of its heart,

283
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:12,246
which we need to
save its life, which we need
to do to save Emma's life.

284
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:14,682
You're gonna need to
get her consent.

285
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,455
Well, that shouldn't be
too hard.

286
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:19,020
"Sign here or you
and your baby both die."

287
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,656
I'm going with you.

288
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,963
Oh, good.

289
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:28,830
You said sedation was risky.
This sounds insane.

290
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:31,877
The injection goes into
the umbilical cord.

291
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:33,309
The baby won't feel a thing.

292
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,210
Fetus.

293
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:39,851
I'm lowering expectations.
It works here and on dates.

294
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,546
The benefits outweigh
the risks

295
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,418
and the paralytic will
wear off in an hour, okay?

296
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:48,658
Must be easier to hear
you might die
than your baby might die.

297
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:52,191
But if there's anyone
I would trust to save my baby,

298
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,757
it would be Dr. House.

299
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:00,571
Fetus.

300
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,433
Hold this.

301
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:33,662
Dr. Cameron.
The MRI results back?

302
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:35,263
The fetus's heart
is structurally sound.

303
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,502
The problem's
with the bladder.
It's four times normal size.

304
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:38,565
Let me see.

305
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,612
The bladder's so engorged
it's taking up
the whole torso,

306
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,146
squeezing
all the other organs.

307
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,613
There's no room
for the lungs to develop.

308
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:45,547
The baby has a lower
urinary tract obstruction.

309
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,279
We can fix that
by inserting a shunt.

310
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:48,513
I'll give Emma the news.

311
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:50,418
Are you taking over the case?

312
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:53,014
House won't care.
He has his diagnosis.

313
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:55,916
Doctor Cameron.

314
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:01,027
Dating Chase can only end
in one of two ways.

315
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,124
House told you?

316
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:04,533
You get married
and live happily ever after,

317
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:07,401
or somebody gets hurt
and you two
can't work together,

318
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:08,804
and I have to fire somebody.

319
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:11,274
I would hate to see
my personal life become
such a burden to you.

320
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:12,401
I'm telling you this
for your own good.

321
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:15,345
I assume you're gonna have
this same conversation
with Chase for his own good.

322
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,110
Chase isn't the one
that's gonna get hurt here.

323
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:36,864
There's only room for one
but I could skooch over.

324
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,995
My social life
is my social life.

325
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:40,368
Couldn't agree more.

326
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,772
What goes on in the privacy
of a janitor's closet
is nobody's business except...

327
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:45,810
She told me to end it.
Is that what you want?

328
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:47,675
I was actually hoping
she'd fire one of you.

329
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:48,974
What are you doing?

330
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,447
Trying to avoid
altitude sickness.

331
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:52,211
Couldn't score a direct flight
to Cambodia,

332
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:55,742
so I've decided to scale
Argentina's infamous
Mount Aconcagua.

333
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:57,584
Perfect except for the fact
that you can't walk.

334
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:00,853
There's a tribe of
Mocoví Indians who actually
carry the elders up...

335
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:02,257
You're insane.

336
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:03,955
I'm an insane genius.

337
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:06,361
I set the chamber
for low pressure
instead of high.

338
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,798
Thinner air builds up
the extra red blood cells,

339
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:10,164
creates new capillaries.

340
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:13,534
Few more days in here,
I can save myself six weeks
at base camp.

341
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:14,902
Where's my MRI?

342
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:20,075
There's a blockage
in the urinary tract.

343
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,136
Simple terms,
your baby can't pee.

344
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:24,808
His bladder is swollen
and it's crushing his lungs.

345
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:26,214
Can you fix it?

346
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,947
We can insert a small tube
in the baby's bladder

347
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:31,080
that makes the urine
come out straight through
his belly

348
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,885
for the duration
of the pregnancy.

349
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,155
The bladder decompresses
and the lungs will be able to
develop normally.

350
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:38,958
When the baby gets better,
you should get better.

351
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:41,158
First we just have to
do a test

352
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:44,066
to determine whether
the baby's kidneys
are functioning properly.

353
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,797
And what if they're not?

354
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:49,671
If they're already
too damaged, then there's
really nothing we can do.

355
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:52,905
If this doesn't work out
you can always try again.

356
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:58,973
I miscarried twice
when I was married.

357
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:03,276
After the divorce,
I tried in vitro like
four times before this.

358
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:08,052
I'm 42. Maybe it's
just not meant to be.

359
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:17,368
What are you doing?

360
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,901
You're trying to be me,
so I thought
I'd try to be you.

361
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,462
You don't have
the cleavage for it.

362
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,235
But I have a much tighter ass.

363
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:26,835
Think every day should be
naked Thursday
or is that an oxymoron?

364
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,272
Let me see the results
from the bladder tap.

365
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:32,112
They aren't back yet.

366
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:33,549
They're gonna be inconclusive.

367
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,280
You think my diagnosis
is wrong?

368
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,879
Fetus doesn't pee,
amniotic fluid should be low.

369
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:39,116
Mom's level is fine.

370
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:40,317
Doesn't mean I'm wrong.

371
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,223
Could just mean
we caught the obstruction
early.

372
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:44,057
Either way your test
will be inconclusive.

373
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:47,189
The urine you've collected
has been sitting in that
fetus's bladder for weeks.

374
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:50,793
As my pappy always said,
"Stale pee is useless pee."

375
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:52,427
Fine. I'll do another tap.

376
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:53,596
Just as useless.

377
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:57,137
Old urine drops down
from the kidney
right after the first tap

378
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,267
'cause it's so backed up.

379
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:00,868
Bladder tap number three
will give you
the freshest pee.

380
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:03,642
That's when you'll find out
if this fetus has even
a fighting chance.

381
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:04,977
Thank you.

382
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,082
I'll run two more taps.

383
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:10,087
Since when does
the Dean of Medicine
run bladder taps?

384
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:11,520
She's an important patient.

385
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,957
Because she takes pictures
or because she's you?

386
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:19,219
Woman in her 40s, single,

387
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:23,431
using a turkey baster
as a last gasp at motherhood.

388
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:28,328
Maybe you want to
make sure she succeeds
so you'll still have hope.

389
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:32,141
You can't be a good doctor
if you're not objective.

390
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:34,478
It's your file.
I don't want it.

391
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:36,639
Then why did you just
say all that stuff?

392
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:38,114
To humiliate you.

393
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:40,481
You're taking the case back.
I don't want it.

394
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:42,543
Your diagnosis is right.
I want to go on vacation.

395
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,249
You can go on vacation
after you've cured her.

396
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:51,756
CHASE: Good news.

397
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,924
The fetus's urine
had appropriate levels
of protein and electrolytes,

398
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,934
so its kidneys aren't damaged.

399
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,035
Oh, wow.

400
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,029
We're gonna put the shunt in.

401
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:03,938
Your baby's lungs
should have more room to grow

402
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:06,409
and your symptoms
should go away.

403
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,372
But he'll still need surgery,
after he's born?

404
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:11,973
That's when we'll
remove the blockage
in the ureter.

405
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:15,611
You'll be the only mother
on the planet who appreciates
the value of a wet diaper.

406
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:17,348
Hey, could you hand me that?

407
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:18,855
I'm keeping
a visual memory book

408
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:22,451
of this entire surreal process
and this is the best part
of the story so far.

409
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:24,325
Yeah. Sure.
Thanks.

410
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:27,798
When'd you take this?

411
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:29,424
She did the
second bladder tap.

412
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:31,660
You should keep it.

413
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:34,467
Oh, I see her all day at work.
I don't need it.

414
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:37,971
Maybe you want to see her
after work.

415
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:40,476
I'm right, right?

416
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:44,272
I saw the way you look at her.

417
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:54,653
Thanks.

418
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:07,264
The shunt is
in the right position.

419
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:09,204
Bladder is starting
to decompress.

420
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:10,434
No infection.

421
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,443
Did House say anything else?
About us?

422
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:19,416
I thought you didn't
care about his reaction.
Trying to make him jealous?

423
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:20,746
I like my job.

424
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:22,810
He can't fire you
just because we're together.

425
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:26,016
We're not "together,"
and House can do
whatever he wants.

426
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:31,854
How's my baby?
Doing just fine, Emma.

427
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:32,954
So are you.

428
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:34,191
My stomach's killing me.

429
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:36,862
That's not her stomach.

430
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,565
Can you open your eyes, Emma?
I just need to take a look.

431
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,008
What is it?

432
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,271
Emma's jaundiced.
Her liver's shutting down.

433
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:55,117
Figures.
Just booked my trip
to Johnston Strait.

434
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:58,213
I thought you were
climbing Mount Whatever
in Argentina.

435
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,986
Apparently I'd have to live
with the Mocoví Indians
for 20 years

436
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:02,856
before they'd consider me
an elder.

437
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:06,386
Decided to go kayaking
with orca instead.
No legs required.

438
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:09,696
Can't leave yet.
Liver failure puts her case
back into the unsolved pile.

439
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,965
Increased AST, ALT
and her bilirubin's
off the charts.

440
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,100
Even fetuses lie.

441
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:22,775
We diagnosed a lower
urinary tract obstruction
because we saw one.

442
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:26,243
What if that's not
the whole story?

443
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:29,985
What if the little bugger
is hiding something?

444
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:32,989
The real reason
for the mirror syndrome.

445
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,524
Have we looked under its bed?

446
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:36,754
We checked its diary?

447
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:38,489
If it's not GU,
could be the heart.

448
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:39,791
Hypoplastic
left heart syndrome.

449
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:41,526
There were no
structural problems.
The lungs.

450
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,431
We won't be able to
get a good look
until they develop.

451
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:45,493
It'll be weeks...
She's not gonna last weeks.

452
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,832
What do you want to do?

453
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:49,965
Maternal mirror syndrome
has one sure fire cure.

454
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:51,901
Deliver the fetus.

455
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,343
That's not viable at 21 weeks.
You'll kill the baby.

456
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:56,643
Fetus.
Semantics
make you feel better?

457
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:57,739
Pretend it's not a person?

458
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,875
Can it play catch? Can it eat?

459
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:01,919
Can it take pretty pictures?

460
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,187
Who wants to tell her?

461
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:15,122
The swollen bladder
was not the only problem.

462
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:20,069
We can't leave it inside you.
We have to terminate.

463
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:22,038
Well, can't you deliver him?

464
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:25,270
Put him on a respiratory
machine till you
figure out what's wrong?

465
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,574
We can. And it won't matter.

466
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:32,581
The fetus is still at least
two weeks away
from being viable.

467
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:36,549
Well, I'll suffer through this
for two more weeks then.

468
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:42,323
You're on dialysis
for your kidneys.
Your kidneys can wait.

469
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:45,728
They don't make dialysis
for your liver.

470
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,898
You're not gonna make it
two more days.

471
00:22:57,075 --> 00:22:59,236
I'm not gonna let you
kill my baby.

472
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,405
It's killing you.

473
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:05,074
I'm not having an abortion.

474
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:08,518
It's not a baby. It's a tumor.

475
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:15,859
I understand
dying for a cause.

476
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:20,193
Sacrificing your life so
your child might live. But
that's not the choice here.

477
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:25,865
Either it dies
or you both die.

478
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:28,972
Or you fix him
and we both live.

479
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,564
I can't fix it.

480
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:36,843
I'm scheduling a D&C.

481
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,177
I won't consent.

482
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:44,078
So I guess
you have two days
to figure it out.

483
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:55,762
Her kidneys are
almost irreparable.

484
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:59,065
She's developed severe DIC.
You have to force her
to terminate.

485
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:01,833
Did you give corticosteroids
to speed up the baby's
lung development?

486
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:05,604
No. I dropped an anvil
on its chest to prevent
lung development.

487
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:09,042
I'm trying to extinguish
the human race
one fetus at a time.

488
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,947
Give the lungs more time
to expand so you can
see inside them.

489
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:13,211
See if they're the problem.

490
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,185
My real patient is dying.

491
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:18,780
Very quickly. Like I wouldn't
advise her to buy
any green bananas.

492
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:21,018
The fetus is nothing more
than a parasite at this point.

493
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:22,559
Removing it
is an instant cure.

494
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,390
You're not gonna get Emma
to see it that way.

495
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:25,589
She's probably already
named the baby,

496
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:27,723
read him books,
had conversations with him.

497
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,461
See, you get it.
She'll listen to you.
No.

498
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:34,767
If you let this woman refuse
to terminate, you're helping
her commit suicide.

499
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,308
As her doctor
my recommendation is
against suicide.

500
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:38,808
If the baby had a doctor,

501
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:42,870
I think she would recommend
exhausting all possibilities
before taking its life.

502
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:44,006
Then she'd be an idiot.

503
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:45,777
Too bad she's your boss!

504
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:49,517
What if our original
assumption is wrong?

505
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:50,850
It isn't.

506
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:52,651
If we assume
she doesn't have
mirror syndrome,

507
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:55,192
then terminating her pregnancy
isn't gonna
help her liver at all.

508
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,353
We eliminated
all other possibilities.

509
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:59,761
The fetus is hydropic
and in distress.

510
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,925
Emma's kidneys and liver
are failing.
The diagnosis is solid.

511
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:05,901
Wow! The ass-kisser
won't agree with you.

512
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:07,836
You must be even wronger
than I thought.

513
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:08,998
Fine.

514
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:11,973
Let's assume she had
mirror syndrome

515
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:14,841
but we fixed it when we fixed
the baby's bladder.

516
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:18,849
That means that
her failing liver would be
completely unrelated.

517
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:22,409
If it is, we can fix it and
we don't have to terminate.

518
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:25,479
So her theory is
that our patient's
liver problems

519
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:27,718
were just a giant coincidence.

520
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:29,123
It's not a surprising
coincidence.

521
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,355
Pregnant women
can develop liver problems.

522
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:35,263
If this is the case,
we can actually
do something here.

523
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,961
Don't you guys
think that's worth exploring?

524
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:41,164
Acute fatty liver of pregnancy
would have the same symptoms.

525
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:43,673
Thank you.
Brownnoser.

526
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:47,803
Viral hepatitis,
HELLP syndrome.
Oh, look.

527
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:52,041
Sticking up
for your girlfriend.
Who says chivalry's dead?

528
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,845
He's not joking?

529
00:25:56,187 --> 00:26:00,783
Be patient. She's going
through all of us. She'll get
that jungle fever eventually.

530
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:03,919
I'm not going through anyone.
You love him?

531
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:07,021
This can probably wait until
after you biopsy Emma's liver,
right?

532
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:09,032
We can't.
Her platelets are too low.

533
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,729
Once we pierce her liver,
it'll be next to impossible
to stop the bleeding.

534
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:14,237
Come in from above.

535
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:17,336
Instead of going straight in
through her abdomen,

536
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,808
go in through the veins
in her neck.

537
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:21,778
Transjugular hepatic biopsy.

538
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:25,714
If the liver starts to bleed,
it'll bleed right back
into her own veins.

539
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,392
Why don't you start
your vacation now?

540
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:47,999
Threading the guide wire
through the right
internal jugular vein.

541
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:50,667
So, the sleep lab...

542
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:53,367
You and Cameron not sleeping.

543
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,977
How serious is it?

544
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:57,207
It's nothing.

545
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,750
She's only doing it
to make House jealous.

546
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:02,082
Then why are you doing it?
You kidding?

547
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:05,122
You're approaching
the inferior vena cava.
Slow down.

548
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:08,148
You better not hurt her.

549
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,420
She already has a big brother.
She does?

550
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:13,464
You obviously care
very deeply about her.

551
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:16,227
I'm not protecting her.
I'm protecting myself.

552
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:18,967
A heartbroken,
lovesick Cameron

553
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:21,665
would be even more unbearable
than she is now.

554
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:23,999
You're through
the hepatic vein.

555
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:25,565
(MACHINE BEEPING)
I'm firing the needle.

556
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:29,007
Heart rate and BP spiking.
Get that out of her.

557
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,881
Fetus's heart rate
just dropped to 50.

558
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:36,018
We've got contractions.
Pre-term labor.

559
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,951
Start a terbutaline drip!

560
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,766
We were able to control
the pre-term labor
with tocolytics.

561
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,768
The contractions
have subsided for now.

562
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:54,805
And the liver biopsy
was negative. This is
definitely mirror syndrome.

563
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:55,862
Her baby's doing this to her.

564
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:56,964
We're out of options.

565
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:59,738
Did the biopsy cause
the pre-term labor
or did it happen on its own?

566
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:01,039
It doesn't make a difference.

567
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:02,545
Pre-term labor
can be a new symptom.

568
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:05,276
New information gives us
new theories.
Isn't that how it works?

569
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,374
Not in this case.

570
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:10,012
Her body's trying to do
what you refuse to, get the
baby out and save itself.

571
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:12,352
Patient's transaminases
are 10 times normal.

572
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:14,289
Her liver is on the verge
of shutting down completely.

573
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,485
A torch test could...

574
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,391
We don't have time
for more tests.

575
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:19,623
We have to terminate
or she'll die.

576
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:22,759
Then let's work faster.

577
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:26,035
Medicine doesn't work faster
just because you
hope real hard.

578
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:28,163
But it could help to see
what the baby's been hiding.

579
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:31,231
The only organ we haven't
been able to look inside
is its lungs.

580
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:32,401
The problem must be in there.

581
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:35,344
We haven't been able to
see inside because
they're underdeveloped.

582
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:38,280
We've already got her
on corticosteroids, but it'll
take weeks for them...

583
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:41,341
Then let's drown them
in corticosteroids,
multiple courses.

584
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:42,511
Speed up their development.

585
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:45,522
Giving the baby more than one
course will suppress
adrenal gland function.

586
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:48,821
Have long-term adverse effects
on fetal organ development.

587
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,986
Worse than death?
Emma's already on tocolytics.

588
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,962
The combination could put her
into pulmonary edema.

589
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:54,362
You'll just kill her faster.

590
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:56,866
It's the only chance we have
to see inside those lungs.

591
00:28:56,935 --> 00:29:01,099
We're just gonna have to
make the baby better faster
than we make Emma worse.

592
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:03,774
Come on! This is the kind
of thing House does every day.

593
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:06,572
House thought we should
terminate six hours ago.

594
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:11,280
I'll do it myself.

595
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:18,614
Anybody gonna stop her?

596
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,248
Stopping the madness
is her job.

597
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:22,793
Somebody's got to be
Cuddy's Cuddy.

598
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,028
Nurse!

599
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:41,576
Pulmonary edema?
Who tattled?
It doesn't matter.

600
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,681
There's a reason we don't give
multiple courses
of corticosteroids.

601
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:46,239
Gee, thanks.

602
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:47,579
It's time to terminate.

603
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:48,812
That's not what she wants.

604
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:50,115
Look at her.

605
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:54,522
She didn't want to be
an incubator for a dead baby,
but that's what you've done.

606
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:57,356
Either get me a laryngoscope
or get out!

607
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:43,231
You were right.

608
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:44,866
You were all right.

609
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:47,434
Now the mom's lungs
are shutting down.

610
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:51,474
She's dying faster
than the baby's lungs
are developing.

611
00:30:51,716 --> 00:30:53,513
I had to stop
the corticosteroids.

612
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:55,314
Have you spoken to the family?

613
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:57,752
The only family she's got
is that baby.

614
00:30:57,822 --> 00:30:59,346
Well, he's biased.

615
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,459
What do you think
House would do?

616
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:03,892
House wants to terminate.

617
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,186
I mean if he didn't.

618
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:09,062
If he shared my position,
what do you think he would do?

619
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:11,158
He wouldn't share your pain.

620
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:13,369
He'd be objective.

621
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:14,564
Right.

622
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,236
He would prioritize
his problems.

623
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:19,503
He'd terminate.

624
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:22,637
He wouldn't be afraid
of screwing with her lungs
if there was a bigger issue.

625
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,738
There is no bigger issue.

626
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:25,783
She needs her lungs.
Not right now.

627
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,750
She's already on a respirator.

628
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:29,218
The machine is
breathing for her.

629
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:30,879
I can do whatever
I want to her lungs.

630
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:33,924
If you're playing catch in
the living room and you break
your mother's vase,

631
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:36,460
you may as well
keep playing catch.
The vase is already broken.

632
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:40,088
Yeah, except that room
can't breathe
without that vase.

633
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:42,564
I'm putting her back on
corticosteroids.

634
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:46,669
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

635
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,374
It worked.
What worked?

636
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:53,205
I got the baby's lungs
to expand.

637
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:55,109
We should be able to figure...
Cab's on its way.

638
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:57,170
I have to finish packing.

639
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:00,947
I have a whole new
appreciation for what you do.

640
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:03,419
How hard it is to believe
when everyone around you

641
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:04,477
is telling you
that you're wrong.

642
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:06,455
Helps to know they're idiots.

643
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:09,091
Do you think I'm an idiot?

644
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,388
You're not objective.

645
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:14,764
But you're not an idiot.

646
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:20,103
These lungs are still
two weeks away
from being viable.

647
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:21,729
But big enough
for a diagnosis.

648
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:23,398
These tissue buds are new.

649
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:25,942
Could indicate
bronchopulmonary sequestration

650
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,875
or diaphragmatic eventration.

651
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,847
I was thinking bronchogenic
cyst or bronchial atresia.

652
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:32,712
Could be lung lesions, CCAM.

653
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:33,876
What about...

654
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:42,785
Move.

655
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,222
Thought you
started your vacation.

656
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:50,324
Somebody had to save
our boss's rotundous ass.

657
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:52,665
Latest MRI of the Sloan fetus.

658
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:55,001
Small buds in the lungs
could indicate...
Thanks.

659
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:56,700
Got the multiple choice
all worked out.

660
00:32:56,774 --> 00:33:00,005
Question is, how do we pick
between A, B, C, D,
and none of the above?

661
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:02,512
Portable MRI is in her room.
We could get a current image.

662
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,572
The fetal lungs are so tiny
the MRI won't give us
the detail we need.

663
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:09,780
What would we do
if this patient were
not just a tadpole?

664
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:11,321
Say it was an actual person.

665
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:12,720
He is a person.

666
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,451
Thanks for playing along.

667
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:16,288
Pretend it's
a one-pound adult.

668
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:19,091
Forget the mom,
forget the womb, the placenta.

669
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,688
How would we get a better look
at what's in the lungs?

670
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:22,994
Transesophageal echo.

671
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:24,364
Can't access his esophagus.

672
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:26,096
High resolution CT
could give us a clearer...

673
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,730
Too much radiation
for a one-pound person.

674
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:32,109
You can't just shoot
everything down, Chase.

675
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,474
You're not me. Collaborate.

676
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:38,009
A ventilation perfusion scan
would be next.

677
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:41,848
How do we get a fetus
to breathe in
a radioactive isotope, idiot?

678
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:44,178
If it were really a person
and we had no other options

679
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:45,916
we'd do an
exploratory surgery.

680
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:48,390
Cut into its chest
and have a look around.

681
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:49,756
Let's do that.

682
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:53,362
You're the one who insists
we treat it like a person.

683
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:55,422
I'll put it back
when I'm done.

684
00:33:58,703 --> 00:33:59,965
Me again.

685
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,734
It's your friendly
neighborhood belly squirter.

686
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:05,033
We're gonna do
open fetal surgery.

687
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:08,078
Open the uterus,
cut out the fetus
so we can look around.

688
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:12,640
I know you can't talk so
I need you to look petrified
if you consent.

689
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,810
The umbilical cord
won't be cut.

690
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:18,720
During surgery, your body
will basically serve as
the baby's heartllung machine.

691
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:21,224
We find what's wrong
and we fix it.

692
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:22,350
If we can.

693
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:25,760
Don't lower expectations
if you want them
to do something.

694
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,957
She should know
what she's facing.

695
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,328
This is incredibly dangerous.

696
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,372
It risks both your lives.

697
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:37,634
The only reason why
we're suggesting

698
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:40,404
it is because there's
nothing else we can do.

699
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:05,495
You all here
for the fetal surgery?

700
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:07,694
'Cause we're
way over capacity.

701
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:09,769
Mind each other's
personal space.

702
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:12,139
There are sharp implements
in the room.

703
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,541
Like this one.

704
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:23,384
Uterus is fully exposed.

705
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:33,729
And we're in.

706
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,925
Start draining
the amniotic fluid.

707
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:41,232
Have you never sucked beer
out of the bottom of a keg?

708
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,569
Where'd you go to college?
Give me that.

709
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,136
Affix the pulse ox
to the palm.

710
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,036
House?

711
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:22,101
Sorry.

712
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:25,338
Just realized
I forgot to TiVo <i>Alien.</i>

713
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:35,483
Fetal heart rate good.
Stats are stable.

714
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,424
Position him for the incision.

715
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:46,269
I see three well-defined
lesions.

716
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:49,636
It's definitely CCAM.
I should be able to
resect them.

717
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,765
(MONITOR BEEPING)

718
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:54,407
It's the mom. She's in V-fib.

719
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:57,310
Charging.

720
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,242
Clear!
I'm clear.

721
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:05,822
Looks like asystole.
Paddling isn't
going to do anything.

722
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,290
It's fine V-fib.
I'm going again. Clear!

723
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,125
We're gonna lose them both.
Clamp!

724
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,491
The surgery's not
doing this to her.
The fetus is.

725
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,125
Step away, House.
I'm going again.

726
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:21,660
The only way to save her
is to cut away the anchor
holding her down.

727
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:24,367
You keep going,
you're gonna get electrocuted.

728
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:26,933
Clear!

729
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:29,905
Going again. Clear!

730
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:32,814
(MONITOR BEEPING)

731
00:37:33,117 --> 00:37:35,551
Heart rate's returning
to normal.

732
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:40,316
Continue with the lobectomy.

733
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:53,235
So my kidneys, liver and lungs
are all fine just like that?

734
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,736
Just like that.
That's amazing.

735
00:37:57,975 --> 00:38:01,843
What's amazing
is how blonde your
baby's hair is.

736
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:05,512
My baby?

737
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:07,778
The thing in your belly
that tried to kill you.

738
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:10,150
You've never called him
a baby before.

739
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:17,925
Any pain?

740
00:38:17,995 --> 00:38:19,622
Nothing I can't deal with.

741
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:22,257
You can only get out of bed
to pee, pooh or shower.

742
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:25,666
And absolutely no sex.
So stop flirting with me.

743
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:28,463
Sorry.

744
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:34,308
So this really worked?
He'll be normal?

745
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:38,777
Well, if you call
being born twice normal.

746
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:45,552
Hey, thank you.

747
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:52,354
Don't thank me.
I would've killed the kid.

748
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:04,033
Wanna grab a bite?
In a minute.

749
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:06,201
Emma asked me to
bring up her camera.

750
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:07,744
I'll walk with you.

751
00:39:10,214 --> 00:39:12,409
When'd she take
this picture of you?

752
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:15,518
You look so...

753
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,248
I'm smiling.

754
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:19,948
I have a nice smile.

755
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,322
No, I've never
seen you like this.

756
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,158
She got you to glow.

757
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:27,926
What were you doing?

758
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:30,634
What did she say to you?

759
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:33,536
I always glow.

760
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:46,842
House.

761
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:49,481
Need you to take
a look at something.

762
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:51,919
I'm off the clock.
Just open it.

763
00:39:57,962 --> 00:39:59,987
A first-class ticket
to Vancouver Island.

764
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,931
Shoot! The wrong envelope.

765
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:09,806
I think it's great.
Yeah.

766
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:12,908
Who doesn't like Canadians?
It's big.

767
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:16,378
You're trying to have a life.
You're trying to
enjoy yourself.

768
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:18,312
You didn't need to apologize.

769
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:19,713
I'm not. I told you why I...

770
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:20,944
Screwed up.

771
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:23,111
I saved a life.
I saved two lives.

772
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:24,313
You

773
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:28,985
let your maternal instinct
get the best of you
and nearly kill two people.

774
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:31,721
Case like this, you terminate,
mom lives 10 times out of 10.

775
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:32,854
You do what you did

776
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,922
mom and baby both die
9.9 times out of 10.

777
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,764
Sometimes point one
is bigger than 9.9.

778
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:40,804
No, it's smaller.

779
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:44,671
Exactly 9.8 smaller.
Always is. Always will be.

780
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:48,044
Well, not for Emma.
And not for her son.

781
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:52,349
Now go away and be happy.
