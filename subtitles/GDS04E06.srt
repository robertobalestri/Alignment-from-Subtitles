Previously on The Good Doctor..."

2
00:00:01,813 --> 00:00:04,743
The aneurysm caused his
back pain. Dr. Wolke missed it.

3
00:00:04,767 --> 00:00:06,144
I screwed up.

4
00:00:06,168 --> 00:00:07,769
Compressions.

5
00:00:10,899 --> 00:00:12,033
Dr. Wolke.

6
00:00:13,108 --> 00:00:14,108
He's dead.

7
00:00:14,741 --> 00:00:16,277
Take as much time as you need.

8
00:00:17,925 --> 00:00:20,204
The virus has
damaged your mother's lungs.

9
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:22,172
We're doing everything
we can to help her.

10
00:00:23,431 --> 00:00:26,109
120 joules.

11
00:00:26,133 --> 00:00:28,412
I've got hydroxychloroquine,
ribavirin...

12
00:00:28,436 --> 00:00:29,847
I'm twice the size of SJ General.

13
00:00:29,871 --> 00:00:31,882
I should have twice the amount of tests.

14
00:01:19,153 --> 00:01:21,465
Oh, my God, what happened?

15
00:01:21,489 --> 00:01:22,633
Is he okay?

16
00:01:22,657 --> 00:01:23,901
I'm a doctor. What happened?

17
00:01:23,925 --> 00:01:25,769
I don't know. He was running. I honked.

18
00:01:25,793 --> 00:01:27,531
All of a sudden,
he was in front of my car.

19
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,642
Pedestrian versus car,
GCS five at scene.

20
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:33,042
Rigid abdomen with active bleeding.

21
00:01:33,066 --> 00:01:34,630
Flail chest with pneumo.

22
00:01:38,172 --> 00:01:39,439
He needs an ex lap. Now.

23
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,955
We've got a massive hemoperitoneum.

24
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:47,785
I need two large suctions and
lap pads in all four quadrants.

25
00:01:51,352 --> 00:01:52,996
There's a grade-three liver laceration

26
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,364
in right lateral segments.

27
00:01:54,388 --> 00:01:55,799
Liver stitch, number 1 chromic

28
00:01:55,823 --> 00:01:58,004
on a blunt needle and a combat gauze.

29
00:02:06,734 --> 00:02:08,712
What were you doing
on your bike at that hour?

30
00:02:08,736 --> 00:02:10,020
Heading into work.

31
00:02:10,044 --> 00:02:12,816
Trying to prep for my budget
meeting with Glassman.

32
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,852
Mobilize the liver to check for
any associated diaphragm injury.

33
00:02:15,876 --> 00:02:17,487
It's the other side of town.

34
00:02:17,511 --> 00:02:19,317
I was taking the scenic route.

35
00:02:20,047 --> 00:02:21,124
BP's dropping.

36
00:02:21,148 --> 00:02:23,879
He's got another bleed. Add
more lap pads and run the bowel.

37
00:02:25,753 --> 00:02:27,464
There's a perforation
near the terminal ileum.

38
00:02:27,488 --> 00:02:30,912
Ah. Something tore
through the intestinal wall.

39
00:02:34,695 --> 00:02:36,208
It's shrapnel.

40
00:02:36,731 --> 00:02:38,008
From the accident?

41
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:39,242
The coat's eroded.

42
00:02:39,266 --> 00:02:41,005
It looks like it's
been in there a while.

43
00:02:42,336 --> 00:02:44,842
It must have gotten dislodged
in the accident.

45
00:03:00,021 --> 00:03:02,766
How does Asher seem to you?

46
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,368
He seems fine.

47
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:07,604
Too fine for someone who's
just lost their first patient.

48
00:03:07,628 --> 00:03:10,073
I don't have time to worry
about people being too fine.

49
00:03:10,097 --> 00:03:11,908
- He's faking it.
- Good.

50
00:03:11,932 --> 00:03:13,510
The brain releases serotonin
when you smile,

51
00:03:13,534 --> 00:03:15,912
even if you're miserable.
I feel better already.

52
00:03:15,936 --> 00:03:17,714
Denial is not a proven strategy

53
00:03:17,738 --> 00:03:19,282
for psychological health.

54
00:03:19,306 --> 00:03:21,879
Dwelling on things you can't
change doesn't help either.

55
00:03:33,487 --> 00:03:35,065
24-year-old woman came into the ER

56
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:36,900
complaining of abdominal
pain and headaches,

57
00:03:36,924 --> 00:03:38,935
and, surprise, she's pregnant.

58
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,303
Apparently not a happy surprise.

59
00:03:40,327 --> 00:03:41,732
She wants an abortion.

60
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:43,818
Well, what's wrong with her?

61
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,710
I assume you haven't recently
learned the value of sharing,

62
00:03:46,734 --> 00:03:48,211
which makes me think
there's another reason

63
00:03:48,235 --> 00:03:50,247
you're unloading this
onto the surgical department.

64
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,249
She has a congenital IgA deficiency

65
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:53,984
and a history of severe infections.

66
00:03:54,008 --> 00:03:55,285
She'll need IV antibiotics

67
00:03:55,309 --> 00:03:57,421
and close post-surgical observation.

68
00:03:57,445 --> 00:04:00,157
I figured one of your newbies
may as well learn something.

Lea's birthday is tomorrow.

74
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,905
There are many cute frogs

75
00:04:14,929 --> 00:04:16,440
and many romantic songs.

76
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,394
I can't decide.

77
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:24,347
It is my first gift as her boyfriend.

78
00:04:24,371 --> 00:04:27,484
It needs to be... awesome.

79
00:04:27,508 --> 00:04:29,019
Well, then, maybe singing frogs,

80
00:04:29,043 --> 00:04:31,782
however cute, might be a mistake.

81
00:04:32,947 --> 00:04:35,926
Try something more personal or romantic.

82
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,595
And find a resident who
hasn't done a suction D&C

83
00:04:38,619 --> 00:04:40,130
and teach them.

84
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:42,032
Oh. No, n... no.

85
00:04:42,056 --> 00:04:44,045
I'll do it myself.

86
00:04:44,558 --> 00:04:46,470
I'm not going to teach anymore.

87
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,705
I'm a good surgeon. I'll do surgery.

88
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:51,708
Dr. Murphy, part of your
job as a surgeon is to teach.

89
00:04:51,732 --> 00:04:53,677
You can't opt out
because it's difficult.

90
00:04:53,701 --> 00:04:56,546
I am opting out because I'm bad at it.

91
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,148
Well, you can't opt out for any reason.

92
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:01,852
But I may have given you too
much responsibility too soon,

93
00:05:01,876 --> 00:05:04,187
so I will supervise your supervision

94
00:05:04,211 --> 00:05:05,889
until you get the hang of it.

95
00:05:05,913 --> 00:05:07,311
Pick someone.

96
00:05:07,335 --> 00:05:08,859
Did you two lose something?

97
00:05:10,068 --> 00:05:11,256
Our patient.

98
00:05:11,585 --> 00:05:13,029
Rose Babcock.

99
00:05:13,053 --> 00:05:15,799
She's post-op from repair
of a distal radius fracture.

100
00:05:15,823 --> 00:05:17,734
60s. White hair.

101
00:05:17,758 --> 00:05:19,970
Looks at you like she's
staring into your soul.

102
00:05:19,994 --> 00:05:21,004
Does she have a limp?

103
00:05:21,028 --> 00:05:22,096
No.

104
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,197
Well, I think she does now.

105
00:05:24,665 --> 00:05:26,910
Uh, Ms. Babcock,
did you fall down again?

106
00:05:26,934 --> 00:05:28,245
Oh, no, I'm fine.

107
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:31,748
But... But there's a
poor man in room 318

108
00:05:31,772 --> 00:05:33,636
who's in a lot of pain.

109
00:05:34,798 --> 00:05:36,153
Let's get you back in bed.

110
00:05:36,177 --> 00:05:37,177
Ah.

111
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:41,733
Yep.

112
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,529
Apply a new Tegaderm,
not antibiotic ointment.

113
00:05:51,358 --> 00:05:52,903
They breathe.

114
00:05:52,927 --> 00:05:54,905
Don't make us handcuff you to the bed,
Rose.

115
00:05:54,929 --> 00:05:56,106
We charge extra for that.

116
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,035
Dry the skin more so it'll stick.

117
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,178
You're doing just fine, dear.

118
00:06:03,537 --> 00:06:05,048
Heart rate's spiking in the 130s.

119
00:06:05,072 --> 00:06:07,017
BP 162 over 95.

120
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,252
Are you feeling any
pressure in your chest?

121
00:06:09,276 --> 00:06:11,841
No, it's just anxiety.

122
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:14,552
Not mine. It's one of yours.

123
00:06:18,118 --> 00:06:20,697
We're gonna pretend,
since it's happening in your chest,

124
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:22,365
that it's yours.

125
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:24,301
20 milligrams IV labetalol.

126
00:06:24,325 --> 00:06:25,402
I'm fine.

127
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:26,770
I'm an empath.

128
00:06:26,794 --> 00:06:29,306
I can feel what other
people are feeling,

129
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:32,862
and one of you is very stressed out.

130
00:06:35,469 --> 00:06:36,866
Olivia, stay where you are.

131
00:06:37,338 --> 00:06:39,577
And one milligram of Ativan.

132
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,904
Keep away from me!

133
00:07:00,928 --> 00:07:02,572
No! Step back!

134
00:07:02,596 --> 00:07:04,441
Sir, you were in an accident.

135
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:06,109
We're taking care of you.

136
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:08,445
Stop. Stop it! Now!

137
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,013
Get away from me!

138
00:07:10,037 --> 00:07:12,293
I need you to hold
him down while I administer Haldol.

139
00:07:12,773 --> 00:07:14,017
Sir, please just...

140
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,486
I'm warning you. This
room is being cleared.

141
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,199
No one is gonna hurt you.

142
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,523
Ben.

143
00:07:20,547 --> 00:07:21,869
Huh?

144
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,079
You're having a flashback.

145
00:07:27,154 --> 00:07:29,001
You're not in Afghanistan.

146
00:07:30,691 --> 00:07:32,213
You're in the hospital.

147
00:07:33,193 --> 00:07:34,423
Look around.

148
00:07:35,396 --> 00:07:36,550
What do you see?

149
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,468
Zoe?

150
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,655
Yeah. Yeah, baby, it's me.

151
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,390
Zoe, I... I couldn't sleep.

152
00:07:53,414 --> 00:07:56,195
I... I went for a run, and I...

153
00:07:57,084 --> 00:07:58,322
I heard an explosion.

154
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:03,661
And I don't... I don't
know what happened after that.

155
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:06,136
You were hit by a car.

156
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,124
We had to do surgery,
but you're gonna be okay.

157
00:08:09,496 --> 00:08:10,974
It's okay.

158
00:08:10,998 --> 00:08:12,042
Take him back to his room,

159
00:08:12,066 --> 00:08:13,812
make sure he didn't open his wound.

160
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:16,674
I'm sorry.

161
00:08:32,252 --> 00:08:33,465
Dr. Murphy?

162
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,039
Rose is not your patient.

163
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,951
She was teaching me about her gift.

164
00:08:44,975 --> 00:08:48,154
She says the basis
of empathy is curiosity,

165
00:08:48,178 --> 00:08:50,656
which I find curious because...

166
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,259
I'm curious about the job
you're supposed to be doing.

167
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,877
Who are you leading through the D&C?

168
00:08:55,678 --> 00:08:56,840
None of them.

169
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,809
The only one who hasn't
done one does not want to,

170
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,168
so I will.

171
00:09:02,192 --> 00:09:03,469
Which resident?

172
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:07,140
Wanting to is
irrelevant. It's their job.

173
00:09:07,164 --> 00:09:11,244
Wanting to is irrelevant. It's your job.

174
00:09:11,268 --> 00:09:12,678
I'm a Christian.

175
00:09:12,702 --> 00:09:15,356
Performing an abortion
goes against my beliefs.

176
00:09:15,705 --> 00:09:16,705
Okay.

177
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:22,688
You may encounter a situation one day

178
00:09:22,712 --> 00:09:24,991
where this procedure
could save a woman's life.

179
00:09:25,015 --> 00:09:26,459
Then I hope someone else can...

180
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:29,462
And it's my job to make sure
you can perform all surgeries,

181
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,497
including abortions.

182
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,585
So where does that leave us?

183
00:09:38,962 --> 00:09:40,339
I'll do the surgery.

184
00:09:40,363 --> 00:09:41,674
I've only done one.

185
00:09:41,698 --> 00:09:43,342
I'm sure there's a
lot I still can learn.

186
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:49,115
Dr. Murphy, you have a new student.

187
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:51,484
Get her started running
pre-surgery assessments.

188
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,052
Thank you, Olivia.

189
00:09:53,076 --> 00:09:55,104
That's the kind of
ambition I like to see.

190
00:09:57,214 --> 00:09:59,125
He did three tours.

191
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:00,827
He came home after he was injured

192
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:03,196
in some kind of explosion.

193
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,422
I don't really know what happened.

194
00:10:05,446 --> 00:10:07,949
Some... He's tried to tell
me about it several times,

195
00:10:07,973 --> 00:10:09,869
but he just... He breaks down.

196
00:10:09,893 --> 00:10:12,171
When was he diagnosed with PTSD?

197
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:13,831
Two years ago.

198
00:10:14,731 --> 00:10:17,209
But he hasn't been the
same since he got back.

199
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:22,673
At first, he was moody, irritable.

200
00:10:23,273 --> 00:10:25,300
Little things would set him off.

201
00:10:26,176 --> 00:10:27,553
Then the insomnia started.

202
00:10:29,613 --> 00:10:31,932
His mind is just... It's never at rest.

203
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,427
Nights are the worst, you know?

204
00:10:34,451 --> 00:10:35,853
He, um...

205
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:38,431
He gets these terrible nightmares.

206
00:10:39,623 --> 00:10:41,167
Flashbacks.

207
00:10:41,191 --> 00:10:44,403
Just... We can't sleep in
the same room anymore.

208
00:10:48,098 --> 00:10:50,209
Make sure he stays off his feet.

209
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,995
Would you like us to
arrange a psych consult?

210
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:55,205
We've been down that road.

211
00:10:56,373 --> 00:11:00,294
Talk therapy, group therapy,
exposure therapy...

212
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:02,880
endless medications.

213
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,424
Let us know if you change your mind.

214
00:11:49,492 --> 00:11:52,271
♪ Keep diggin' up dirt ♪

215
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:53,996
♪ Keep diggin' up dirt ♪

216
00:11:58,907 --> 00:12:01,415
Jillian, I need those stats
on elective surgeries

217
00:12:01,442 --> 00:12:03,106
for my budget meeting.

218
00:12:03,146 --> 00:12:04,357
And a coffee.

219
00:12:06,749 --> 00:12:07,927
Jillian?

220
00:12:09,586 --> 00:12:12,223
She's not there. I
need approval for this.

221
00:12:15,024 --> 00:12:16,102
And this.

222
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,523
You said I couldn't give her the frogs.

223
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:23,309
Oh, you can't give her this either.

224
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:24,643
You don't know what it is.

225
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:25,878
I know it would mean more

226
00:12:25,902 --> 00:12:27,572
if you had to leave
the building to get it.

227
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:34,120
I would like to do the
suction D&C surgery.

228
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,271
I assume your religious convictions

229
00:12:36,295 --> 00:12:38,224
haven't changed in the last few hours.

230
00:12:38,248 --> 00:12:39,725
No.

231
00:12:39,749 --> 00:12:42,094
But I believe I was put in
this program for a reason.

232
00:12:42,118 --> 00:12:43,362
So, if you think it's important for me

233
00:12:43,386 --> 00:12:45,598
to learn how to do an abortion,

234
00:12:45,622 --> 00:12:46,883
then I should learn.

235
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,771
Take Jordan to the skills
lab. Run the surgery steps.

236
00:12:52,795 --> 00:12:54,740
You two will handle the D&C yourselves.

237
00:12:54,764 --> 00:12:56,559
With you.

238
00:12:57,533 --> 00:13:00,179
How are you going to
supervise my supervision

239
00:13:00,203 --> 00:13:01,447
if you're not there?

240
00:13:01,471 --> 00:13:03,782
I will help you prep
and debrief afterwards.

241
00:13:03,806 --> 00:13:06,352
But this patient doesn't
need a gallery of strangers

242
00:13:06,376 --> 00:13:08,587
standing around,
gawking at her most private experience.

243
00:13:08,611 --> 00:13:10,055
Sorry to interrupt.

244
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,557
Ben woke up complaining of pain.

245
00:13:11,581 --> 00:13:13,125
Did you check the incision?

246
00:13:13,149 --> 00:13:14,577
The pain is in his arm.

247
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,665
Now test external
rotation of the shoulder.

248
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,400
We're almost done.

249
00:13:21,424 --> 00:13:23,044
Can you describe the pain?

250
00:13:23,259 --> 00:13:24,462
Aah!

251
00:13:26,329 --> 00:13:27,806
We'll call it a 10.

252
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:30,276
It's been hurting for years,
but, aah, this is...

253
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,610
This is something else.

254
00:13:31,634 --> 00:13:33,763
How did you injure your shoulder before?

255
00:13:36,806 --> 00:13:38,059
I was in a...

256
00:13:40,109 --> 00:13:43,106
I was in a convoy in Kandahar,

257
00:13:43,613 --> 00:13:44,732
and there was a...

258
00:13:48,251 --> 00:13:51,297
I dislocated my...

259
00:13:51,321 --> 00:13:53,616
You don't need to discuss it with us.

260
00:13:54,624 --> 00:13:55,901
What did you find?

261
00:13:55,925 --> 00:13:58,470
Swelling, sensitivity to touch,
discoloration.

262
00:13:58,494 --> 00:14:00,606
- Could be CRPS.
- What is that?

263
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,308
Well, it appears the car accident

264
00:14:02,332 --> 00:14:04,677
aggravated a prior injury.

265
00:14:04,701 --> 00:14:07,012
You've developed complex
regional pain syndrome.

266
00:14:07,036 --> 00:14:09,448
We'll start you on
Gabapentin and Dilaudid.

267
00:14:09,472 --> 00:14:12,651
Opioids make me a little insane.

268
00:14:12,675 --> 00:14:14,920
We could do a stellate ganglion block.

269
00:14:14,944 --> 00:14:17,656
It's an injection of
anesthetic near the spine

270
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,458
that blocks the pain signals,

271
00:14:19,482 --> 00:14:21,769
and could also help the PTSD.

272
00:14:23,219 --> 00:14:25,931
I've been treated for PTSD for years.

273
00:14:25,955 --> 00:14:27,132
Why haven't I heard about this?

274
00:14:27,156 --> 00:14:29,501
It's experimental, but promising.

275
00:14:29,525 --> 00:14:31,170
The procedure comes with risks:

276
00:14:31,194 --> 00:14:33,772
Vascular injury, infection,
major hematoma.

277
00:14:33,796 --> 00:14:36,659
Dr. Lim, I've been taking a
risk every time I go to sleep.

278
00:14:39,802 --> 00:14:41,447
I want to do it.

279
00:14:41,471 --> 00:14:44,149
Stellate block is an accepted
procedure for treatment of pain.

280
00:14:44,173 --> 00:14:45,718
Which you wouldn't have suggested

281
00:14:45,742 --> 00:14:47,386
if the patient didn't also
have a mental health condition.

282
00:14:48,811 --> 00:14:50,222
I hear Jordan's back on the D&C,

283
00:14:50,246 --> 00:14:52,057
in spite of her righteous indignation.

284
00:14:52,081 --> 00:14:53,459
Is something chirping?

285
00:14:53,483 --> 00:14:55,027
I think you're being unfair.

286
00:14:55,051 --> 00:14:56,495
Well, if anyone's being unfair, it's me.

287
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:58,281
I told Jordan to do it.

288
00:14:58,388 --> 00:14:59,725
I told her.

289
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:02,149
We make decisions that are
hard to live with all the time.

290
00:15:02,173 --> 00:15:03,235
We make them anyway.

291
00:15:03,259 --> 00:15:05,170
And I told her pissing off the Chief

292
00:15:05,194 --> 00:15:07,373
was a very bad way
to start your residency.

293
00:15:07,397 --> 00:15:08,707
Glad to hear you're still moonlighting

294
00:15:08,731 --> 00:15:10,843
as surgical department camp counselor,

295
00:15:10,867 --> 00:15:12,978
but I don't mean you
were being unfair to Jordan.

296
00:15:13,002 --> 00:15:14,346
You're being unfair to the patient.

297
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:17,082
She's facing an emotionally
fraught procedure.

298
00:15:17,106 --> 00:15:19,017
She needs the support of her doctors.

299
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,788
And who she's getting is a rookie
who thinks she's committing murder.

300
00:15:22,345 --> 00:15:23,623
And Shaun.

301
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:28,628
I have a point.

302
00:15:30,853 --> 00:15:32,831
I'll lead Jordan through the D&C myself.

303
00:15:32,855 --> 00:15:34,032
You're happy.

304
00:15:34,056 --> 00:15:35,834
Dr. Murphy will be happy.

305
00:15:35,858 --> 00:15:37,569
My cup runneth over.

306
00:15:37,593 --> 00:15:40,139
Now get whatever's in that
box out of my department.

307
00:15:49,972 --> 00:15:51,359
Morning sickness.

308
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,585
Nurse Ella's.

309
00:15:53,609 --> 00:15:56,054
Rose claims she can feel her pregnancy.

310
00:15:56,078 --> 00:15:57,956
She was right about the guy in Room 318.

311
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,652
He had a clot in his ankle.

312
00:15:59,676 --> 00:16:01,693
I'm sure she picked up
on some subtle clues,

313
00:16:01,717 --> 00:16:04,163
like the guy moaning
and grasping his ankle.

314
00:16:04,987 --> 00:16:08,292
Get a CT to rule out
abdominal injury from her fall.

315
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:12,571
We're going to insert
a thin needle into your neck

316
00:16:12,595 --> 00:16:14,373
so we can inject the anesthetic.

317
00:16:14,397 --> 00:16:15,800
It may sting a bit.

318
00:16:21,504 --> 00:16:23,882
Use an in-plane approach
to place the needle

319
00:16:23,906 --> 00:16:26,310
between the C6 tubercle
and carotid artery.

320
00:16:49,866 --> 00:16:51,878
You might feel some discomfort.

321
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:12,657
_

322
00:17:21,964 --> 00:17:23,075
What's wrong?

323
00:17:23,366 --> 00:17:24,443
Zoe's hurt.

324
00:17:24,467 --> 00:17:25,544
I'm okay.

325
00:17:25,568 --> 00:17:26,945
Get some ice.

326
00:17:26,969 --> 00:17:27,980
Let me take a look.

327
00:17:28,004 --> 00:17:29,181
What happened?

328
00:17:29,205 --> 00:17:30,349
I hit her.

329
00:17:30,373 --> 00:17:31,483
I was laying next to him.

330
00:17:31,507 --> 00:17:33,151
I know I shouldn't,

331
00:17:33,175 --> 00:17:35,521
but the shot just made
his pain feel so much better.

332
00:17:35,545 --> 00:17:36,714
- I thought...
- Zo.

333
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,550
You didn't do anything wrong.

334
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,361
There was a noise in the hall.

335
00:17:42,385 --> 00:17:43,779
- I lashed out.
- I know.

336
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,640
I didn't mean to.

337
00:17:45,988 --> 00:17:47,183
I'm sorry.

338
00:17:53,696 --> 00:17:55,407
Nothing's broken.

339
00:17:55,431 --> 00:17:57,075
I can get you something
for the swelling.

340
00:17:57,099 --> 00:17:59,528
No. I'm okay. I'm gonna go home,
get cleaned up.

341
00:18:01,938 --> 00:18:03,282
I just need some time.

342
00:18:06,075 --> 00:18:07,411
I love you.

343
00:18:20,787 --> 00:18:22,831
I think we can help Ben.

344
00:18:22,855 --> 00:18:24,566
There have been some promising results

345
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:27,336
using Vagal Nerve
Stimulation to treat PTSD.

346
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,671
His scarring would make it impossible

347
00:18:28,695 --> 00:18:31,340
to expose and find the
nerve without damaging it.

348
00:18:31,364 --> 00:18:34,610
Those scars are the
reason that we need to try.

349
00:18:34,634 --> 00:18:37,913
Imagine reliving your worst
nightmare over and over again.

350
00:18:37,937 --> 00:18:39,248
Why doesn't anyone around here

351
00:18:39,272 --> 00:18:40,683
want to do the job they were hired for?

352
00:18:40,707 --> 00:18:42,217
What Ben needs is psychological help.

353
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:43,452
I've ordered a consult.

354
00:18:43,476 --> 00:18:45,547
Leave it to the people
who are trained to do it.

355
00:18:47,246 --> 00:18:48,624
It sets a bad precedent
to force a resident

356
00:18:48,648 --> 00:18:50,359
to do a procedure they're
not comfortable with.

357
00:18:50,383 --> 00:18:52,594
Wow. Does anyone around
here not have an opinion

358
00:18:52,618 --> 00:18:54,635
about who should do that damn abortion?

359
00:18:54,659 --> 00:18:57,261
Jordan had a choice, and in my opinion,
she made the right one.

360
00:18:57,285 --> 00:18:59,368
It's not a true choice if
you're coerced by your boss.

361
00:18:59,393 --> 00:19:01,688
I asked her to do her job.

362
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:04,373
You took an opportunity from
a resident who wants to learn

363
00:19:04,397 --> 00:19:06,108
in favor of one who doesn't.

364
00:19:06,132 --> 00:19:08,377
Is this song and dance about
Jordan doing the procedure

365
00:19:08,401 --> 00:19:10,322
or your niece not doing it?

366
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,181
Neither.

367
00:19:12,205 --> 00:19:15,082
There's a misconception that
Olivia came to St. Bonaventure

368
00:19:15,106 --> 00:19:16,452
because of me.

369
00:19:16,476 --> 00:19:18,872
She's here because of your reputation.

370
00:19:19,178 --> 00:19:20,589
The great Dr. Lim,

371
00:19:20,613 --> 00:19:24,044
a master class in technique,
professionalism, empathy.

372
00:19:25,184 --> 00:19:27,214
Lately, it doesn't seem like
that reputation holds up.

373
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:36,105
I'm giving you an
antibiotic to prevent infection.

374
00:19:36,129 --> 00:19:38,507
The vacuum aspiration
will take about 15 minutes,

375
00:19:38,531 --> 00:19:40,644
and you'll be numbed
with a local anesthetic.

376
00:19:41,334 --> 00:19:43,746
Conscious sedation is also an option,

377
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:46,525
but you will need someone
to drive you home afterwards.

378
00:19:50,209 --> 00:19:51,947
Do you have any questions for me?

379
00:19:57,216 --> 00:19:58,216
I'm scared.

380
00:20:09,362 --> 00:20:12,259
Are you certain you wanna
go ahead with the abortion?

381
00:20:20,073 --> 00:20:21,073
Yes.

382
00:20:24,343 --> 00:20:26,106
Then you don't have to be scared.

383
00:20:27,413 --> 00:20:29,484
You're the making the
right decision for you.

384
00:20:36,489 --> 00:20:38,994
Give her another 400
micrograms of misoprostol.

385
00:20:39,258 --> 00:20:40,746
I'll be back for the procedure.

386
00:20:42,528 --> 00:20:43,872
This doesn't work.

387
00:20:43,896 --> 00:20:45,741
I need these numbers
in spreadsheet format.

388
00:20:45,765 --> 00:20:47,252
- Thank you.
- Oh, excuse me.

389
00:20:51,337 --> 00:20:52,714
Dr. Park?

390
00:20:52,738 --> 00:20:54,301
Rose's CT was normal.

391
00:20:54,574 --> 00:20:56,636
Get an upper GI barium study.

392
00:20:57,777 --> 00:20:59,830
First quarter supply
costs you requested.

393
00:20:59,866 --> 00:21:01,975
Also,
one of your first-years seems upset.

394
00:21:02,448 --> 00:21:04,519
He's been in the stairwell for a while.

395
00:21:07,887 --> 00:21:09,357
Everything okay in here?

396
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:13,612
I just needed some quiet.

397
00:21:16,295 --> 00:21:19,408
Surgeons come into the
stairwell for two reasons,

398
00:21:19,432 --> 00:21:21,411
fire drills or doctor trauma.

399
00:21:22,201 --> 00:21:23,538
You having a fire drill?

400
00:21:25,898 --> 00:21:28,210
I just wish we had a more
effective treatment for Ben.

401
00:21:29,308 --> 00:21:32,547
His head's so messed up,
and we can't help him.

402
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,762
I don't think this is about Ben.

403
00:21:50,163 --> 00:21:51,942
Have you ever lost a patient

404
00:21:52,732 --> 00:21:54,486
you knew you could have saved?

405
00:22:00,106 --> 00:22:02,118
When COVID was at its worst,

406
00:22:02,808 --> 00:22:05,539
we had to cancel all
non-urgent procedures.

407
00:22:06,445 --> 00:22:09,125
A young mom with a heart condition was

408
00:22:10,449 --> 00:22:11,962
more urgent than I thought.

409
00:22:13,586 --> 00:22:16,383
And she died waiting for
me to put her on the schedule.

410
00:22:23,296 --> 00:22:24,891
How do you get past that?

411
00:22:27,366 --> 00:22:29,479
You get past it because that's the job.

412
00:22:32,138 --> 00:22:34,401
You will always remember it.

413
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:38,446
And you will eventually
stop reliving it.

414
00:22:40,513 --> 00:22:42,117
How can you be so sure?

415
00:22:44,951 --> 00:22:47,455
Because if you don't,
you can't be a surgeon.

416
00:22:50,489 --> 00:22:52,460
And I'm pretty sure you're a surgeon.

417
00:22:59,298 --> 00:23:00,677
I should get back to work.

418
00:23:13,813 --> 00:23:15,275
Insert the speculum.

419
00:23:24,357 --> 00:23:26,161
Now dilate the cervix.

420
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:34,502
Begin suction.

421
00:23:48,914 --> 00:23:51,645
Begin gentle suction in the uterus.

422
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,402
Is anything wrong?

423
00:24:00,293 --> 00:24:01,703
You're okay.

424
00:24:01,727 --> 00:24:03,823
Dr. Allen, I can take it from here.

425
00:24:10,603 --> 00:24:12,414
Don't worry. We're almost done.

426
00:24:12,438 --> 00:24:13,792
You're gonna be just fine.

427
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:19,928
You have no idea what that
woman was going through,

428
00:24:19,966 --> 00:24:21,089
and you made it worse for her.

429
00:24:21,113 --> 00:24:22,245
I know. I didn't...

430
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,913
You had an opportunity to opt out
before you walked into that room,

431
00:24:24,943 --> 00:24:26,330
but you agreed to do the procedure,

432
00:24:26,366 --> 00:24:28,096
you took on an
obligation to that patient,

433
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,364
and you failed her.

434
00:24:29,388 --> 00:24:30,799
If you ever do anything like that again,

435
00:24:30,823 --> 00:24:32,686
I will have you removed from my program.

436
00:24:32,912 --> 00:24:34,870
Maybe you should be
cleaning bedpans for a while.

437
00:24:34,894 --> 00:24:37,315
Hopefully there's no
moral objection to that.

438
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:48,410
Why are there adult toys on my desk?

439
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,986
I've heard good things about the Llama,

440
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:53,288
but online reviews
aren't always accurate.

441
00:24:53,312 --> 00:24:54,833
Do you have a favorite?

442
00:24:57,183 --> 00:24:58,894
They're for Lea.

443
00:24:58,918 --> 00:25:01,163
Which one do you like the most, Claire?

444
00:25:01,873 --> 00:25:02,873
Uh...

445
00:25:04,657 --> 00:25:06,052
Uh...

446
00:25:06,459 --> 00:25:09,346
Evidence suggests that trauma
changes the way the brain works.

447
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:12,107
An over active amygdala can
heighten someone's response

448
00:25:12,131 --> 00:25:15,110
to emotional stimuli, including fear.

449
00:25:15,134 --> 00:25:18,347
I think we should consider
amygdala ablation for Ben.

450
00:25:18,371 --> 00:25:20,482
That's crazy.

451
00:25:20,506 --> 00:25:22,818
And completely outside
the scope of our care.

452
00:25:22,842 --> 00:25:24,109
We're s...

453
00:25:25,177 --> 00:25:26,355
Oh.

454
00:25:28,881 --> 00:25:30,192
We're surgeons.

455
00:25:30,216 --> 00:25:32,160
We fix physiological problems,
not mental ones.

456
00:25:32,184 --> 00:25:34,129
It is a physiological problem.

457
00:25:34,153 --> 00:25:35,991
His brain isn't functioning properly.

458
00:25:36,022 --> 00:25:37,999
If it was a tumor that was
causing these reactions,

459
00:25:38,023 --> 00:25:39,668
you wouldn't hesitate to remove it.

460
00:25:39,692 --> 00:25:41,203
But there is no tumor.

461
00:25:41,227 --> 00:25:43,772
You're talking about
inflicting damage on his brain.

462
00:25:43,796 --> 00:25:46,274
He could suffer a stroke
or come out in a coma

463
00:25:46,298 --> 00:25:47,976
or not come out at all.

464
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,345
If you use a stereotactic laser approach

465
00:25:50,369 --> 00:25:52,114
rather than an open craniotomy,

466
00:25:52,138 --> 00:25:53,315
you would greatly reduce the risks.

467
00:25:53,339 --> 00:25:54,983
This is not your case!

468
00:25:55,007 --> 00:25:56,287
You cannot jump into this one

469
00:25:56,311 --> 00:25:58,387
because you don't want to
do the one assigned to you,

470
00:25:58,411 --> 00:26:00,917
which is to teach,
which you've made my problem

471
00:26:00,941 --> 00:26:03,558
just like you made Lea's
birthday gifts my problem.

472
00:26:03,582 --> 00:26:06,196
You need to grow up and
accept some responsibility.

473
00:26:31,577 --> 00:26:33,890
I was diagnosed with PTSD last year.

474
00:26:36,248 --> 00:26:38,853
I kept it mainly private.

475
00:26:40,453 --> 00:26:42,315
Melendez really helped me through it.

476
00:26:44,023 --> 00:26:47,821
It was nice to have a friend to lean on.

477
00:26:49,228 --> 00:26:50,824
So if you need one...

478
00:27:05,544 --> 00:27:07,257
I feel

479
00:27:08,447 --> 00:27:09,717
off.

480
00:27:11,984 --> 00:27:13,221
Disconnected.

481
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,724
Like I can't catch my breath.

482
00:27:19,492 --> 00:27:20,492
But

483
00:27:22,127 --> 00:27:23,273
it comes with the job.

484
00:27:24,163 --> 00:27:25,441
I'll get over it.

485
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,081
It's Ben.

486
00:27:37,309 --> 00:27:38,453
Ben.

487
00:27:38,477 --> 00:27:39,873
No one is gonna hurt you.

488
00:27:42,448 --> 00:27:43,960
You're having a flashback.

489
00:27:49,955 --> 00:27:51,259
I know where I am.

490
00:27:53,792 --> 00:27:55,170
Every day since I came home,

491
00:27:55,194 --> 00:27:57,473
I've felt like there's
a monster chasing me.

492
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:59,434
I try to outrun it

493
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,231
but I end up hurting
the one I love the most.

494
00:28:07,339 --> 00:28:09,017
I'm a threat to everyone around me.

495
00:28:09,041 --> 00:28:11,279
No, Ben, you just need help.

496
00:28:12,778 --> 00:28:14,073
Nothing helps.

497
00:28:15,514 --> 00:28:17,526
I can't smile. I can't laugh.

498
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:19,579
I can't feel anything but pain.

499
00:28:23,355 --> 00:28:25,335
I make everyone around me

500
00:28:26,959 --> 00:28:27,959
suffer.

501
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:35,646
Ben.

502
00:28:36,835 --> 00:28:38,336
There's a surgery that may help.

503
00:29:01,055 --> 00:29:05,135
I would like to scrub in on
the amygdala ablation surgery.

504
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:07,537
Rose said you're feeling
overwhelmed and need...

505
00:29:07,561 --> 00:29:10,140
I don't wanna hear any more
things that woman has said.

506
00:29:10,164 --> 00:29:12,108
Your job is to supervise your residents.

507
00:29:12,132 --> 00:29:14,444
Why are you here instead of doing that?

508
00:29:14,468 --> 00:29:17,280
You said you were going
to supervise my supervision,

509
00:29:17,304 --> 00:29:19,849
but you didn't. You took over my case.

510
00:29:19,873 --> 00:29:22,957
I don't know what I was
supposed to learn or how.

511
00:29:25,826 --> 00:29:26,961
Scrub in.

512
00:29:31,518 --> 00:29:34,664
Dr. Murphy,
walk Asher through the probe placement

513
00:29:34,688 --> 00:29:36,971
and trajectory to the amygdala.

514
00:29:39,193 --> 00:29:41,851
I will supervise your supervision.

515
00:29:43,697 --> 00:29:45,408
Okay, insert the probe

516
00:29:45,432 --> 00:29:47,982
perpendicular to the cortical surface.

517
00:30:01,749 --> 00:30:03,727
Stop! You're off course.

518
00:30:03,751 --> 00:30:05,328
On the current trajectory,

519
00:30:05,352 --> 00:30:07,409
you will penetrate a
branch of the choroidal artery

520
00:30:07,454 --> 00:30:09,165
and cause a hemorrhage.
Step away from the probe.

521
00:30:09,189 --> 00:30:11,839
Your job is to teach,

522
00:30:12,092 --> 00:30:13,524
not take over.

523
00:30:21,802 --> 00:30:25,882
Adjust the probe one
millimeter inferiorly.

524
00:30:25,906 --> 00:30:28,564
Avoid the temporal horn on your right.

525
00:30:29,743 --> 00:30:32,527
I can't see it on the image guidance.

526
00:30:35,582 --> 00:30:37,699
Tell Asher what you see.

527
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:49,739
It should point toward your
six o'clock on the Y axis.

528
00:30:49,763 --> 00:30:51,713
You have to feel it.

529
00:30:54,587 --> 00:30:55,717
The...

530
00:30:57,171 --> 00:31:01,391
The tissue plane along
the parenchyma is smooth.

531
00:31:01,431 --> 00:31:03,975
It should feel like gliding.

532
00:31:13,353 --> 00:31:15,445
You've reached the amygdala.

533
00:31:17,991 --> 00:31:20,950
Ready to begin thermal laser ablation.

534
00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:28,278
Rose's upper GI and labs were normal.

535
00:31:28,302 --> 00:31:29,946
Should we keep her
another day to observe?

536
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:31,748
No. If she's stable,
let's send her home.

537
00:31:31,772 --> 00:31:34,021
- Okay, I'll have Olivia...
- Open your mouth.

538
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,940
Pardon me?

539
00:31:36,703 --> 00:31:38,509
Open your mouth.

540
00:31:42,883 --> 00:31:44,640
- I can, uh...
- Shut your mouth.

541
00:31:47,187 --> 00:31:49,032
- There's this rat.
- A mouse.

542
00:31:49,056 --> 00:31:50,778
A little dead mouse in the garage,

543
00:31:50,802 --> 00:31:52,905
and the big, strong man
is afraid to get it out.

544
00:31:52,929 --> 00:31:54,471
Not afraid, disgusted.

545
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:56,172
Neither of us wanna deal with it,

546
00:31:56,196 --> 00:31:59,088
so we are settling it in the
only responsible way, a bet.

547
00:31:59,116 --> 00:32:01,177
A dare. A series of dares, actually.

548
00:32:01,201 --> 00:32:02,712
Whoever wusses out first has to...

549
00:32:02,736 --> 00:32:05,119
Take those things out of your mouth.

550
00:32:05,672 --> 00:32:06,950
I will discharge Rose.

551
00:32:06,974 --> 00:32:08,351
You two, go home.

552
00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:10,153
- We were just...
- Being idiots at work,

553
00:32:10,177 --> 00:32:11,968
while people are sick and dying.

554
00:32:11,992 --> 00:32:13,419
Go home.

555
00:32:20,154 --> 00:32:23,137
All your tests are normal.
We're discharging you.

556
00:32:25,058 --> 00:32:26,870
Right, because you're psychic.

557
00:32:26,894 --> 00:32:29,672
I'm an empath, not a psychic.

558
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:32,242
Whatever the case,
I would suggest you take it easy.

559
00:32:32,266 --> 00:32:33,710
No drinking, no heavy lifting...

560
00:32:33,734 --> 00:32:35,149
You have to let it out, dear.

561
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,413
It was you.

562
00:32:37,437 --> 00:32:40,029
You made my heart rate spike.

563
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,074
You're about to implode.

564
00:32:46,413 --> 00:32:48,725
There's nothing wrong with you... or me.

565
00:32:51,852 --> 00:32:53,292
Code blue!

566
00:33:31,101 --> 00:33:32,245
Yeah?

567
00:33:35,673 --> 00:33:38,685
Dr. Lim,
my behavior yesterday was inexcusable

568
00:33:38,709 --> 00:33:40,546
and unprofessional.

569
00:33:41,578 --> 00:33:44,257
I let you down. I let the patient down.

570
00:33:44,281 --> 00:33:47,661
I am deeply sorry.

571
00:33:47,685 --> 00:33:49,597
And I promise it will not happen again.

572
00:33:51,422 --> 00:33:54,435
You let your personal judgment
get in the way of doing your job.

573
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,064
You're right. That is inexcusable.

574
00:34:01,732 --> 00:34:05,321
You said I had no idea what
the patient was going through.

575
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:09,075
The truth is I kinda do.

576
00:34:12,443 --> 00:34:16,249
Scared, alone,
afraid of anyone finding out.

577
00:34:19,483 --> 00:34:22,228
I chose my career over motherhood,

578
00:34:22,252 --> 00:34:23,923
over my faith.

579
00:34:25,589 --> 00:34:27,051
But I don't regret it.

580
00:34:30,728 --> 00:34:34,474
And I know God forgave me
because I get to be here,

581
00:34:34,498 --> 00:34:37,812
living my dream of being a doctor.

582
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,945
But I purposely try
not to think about it.

583
00:34:54,251 --> 00:34:55,538
You're off scut duty.

584
00:34:55,753 --> 00:34:56,730
That's not why I...

585
00:34:56,754 --> 00:34:57,820
Take it.

586
00:35:05,549 --> 00:35:07,508
My name is Benjamin Alan Harris.

587
00:35:08,432 --> 00:35:12,471
I'm in St. Bonaventure
Hospital in San Jose.

588
00:35:13,337 --> 00:35:15,915
Language and memory appear to be intact,

589
00:35:15,939 --> 00:35:18,084
and your motor function is normal.

590
00:35:18,108 --> 00:35:19,937
But that doesn't mean
it worked, does it?

591
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:20,987
No.

592
00:35:21,011 --> 00:35:23,423
We'll have to do an fMRI
to see how you respond

593
00:35:23,447 --> 00:35:25,358
to fear-inducing stimuli.

594
00:35:25,382 --> 00:35:27,194
But we'll let you rest for now.

595
00:35:28,077 --> 00:35:30,197
I'm not gonna rest
until I know I'm better.

596
00:35:32,956 --> 00:35:34,868
I want you to know
how I got these scars.

597
00:35:34,892 --> 00:35:36,302
No. Not now.

598
00:35:36,326 --> 00:35:37,871
Just give yourself time.

599
00:35:37,895 --> 00:35:40,916
I was in a convoy in Kandahar.

600
00:35:42,399 --> 00:35:45,779
I was in a Husky,
the big vehicle at the front.

601
00:35:45,803 --> 00:35:47,847
Ben, you don't have to do this.

602
00:35:47,871 --> 00:35:49,258
Ronnie was driving.

603
00:35:49,706 --> 00:35:51,344
He was telling me a story,

604
00:35:51,809 --> 00:35:54,120
something about a goat at the base,

605
00:35:54,144 --> 00:35:56,432
or maybe it was a
chicken. I don't know. But...

606
00:35:58,582 --> 00:35:59,810
We were laughing.

607
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:08,194
Then the world was on fire.

608
00:36:17,434 --> 00:36:19,080
It's the Husky's job

609
00:36:21,105 --> 00:36:23,084
to spot IEDs.

610
00:36:28,946 --> 00:36:30,341
And I missed one.

611
00:36:35,552 --> 00:36:37,223
I can't see their faces.

612
00:36:39,923 --> 00:36:40,923
Just

613
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:45,564
bodies everywhere.

614
00:36:50,934 --> 00:36:52,405
Dying alone,

615
00:36:53,537 --> 00:36:55,074
without their families.

616
00:36:56,807 --> 00:36:58,786
All I could do was hold their hand.

617
00:37:10,487 --> 00:37:11,799
Are you okay, Ben?

618
00:37:47,691 --> 00:37:51,104
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

619
00:37:51,128 --> 00:37:55,642
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

620
00:37:55,666 --> 00:38:00,647
♪ Happy birthday, dear Lea ♪

621
00:38:00,671 --> 00:38:01,681
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

622
00:38:01,705 --> 00:38:02,982
Fun day.

623
00:38:05,976 --> 00:38:06,976
What do you need?

624
00:38:07,711 --> 00:38:09,231
We have a diagnosis.

625
00:38:24,228 --> 00:38:26,123
I thought I felt someone here.

626
00:38:28,565 --> 00:38:30,461
You've had a long day.

627
00:38:33,337 --> 00:38:35,949
You have Prinzmetal's Angina, Rose.

628
00:38:35,973 --> 00:38:38,260
A heart condition.
But it's very treatable.

629
00:38:39,042 --> 00:38:41,287
It explains all your symptoms,

630
00:38:41,311 --> 00:38:43,223
and it's exacerbated by stress,

631
00:38:43,247 --> 00:38:45,309
which is likely what
caused your heart attack.

632
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:49,963
You need to stop seeking
out other people's pain.

633
00:38:49,987 --> 00:38:52,024
It's literally killing you.

634
00:38:55,392 --> 00:38:57,003
You're the Chief of Surgery.

635
00:38:57,027 --> 00:38:59,406
You could have sent
somebody else to tell me this.

636
00:39:00,264 --> 00:39:01,541
Sure.

637
00:39:01,565 --> 00:39:03,536
But then I'd miss my chance to gloat.

638
00:39:04,601 --> 00:39:06,455
You're here because you're hurting

639
00:39:07,371 --> 00:39:09,208
and you don't know where else to go.

640
00:39:12,075 --> 00:39:14,213
Go ahead. Use your magic.

641
00:39:14,911 --> 00:39:17,007
Tell me what's wrong with me.

642
00:39:18,415 --> 00:39:21,303
How do I stop feeling like this?

643
00:39:22,252 --> 00:39:24,197
It doesn't work that way.

644
00:39:24,221 --> 00:39:26,016
I don't have a magic wand.

645
00:39:27,891 --> 00:39:29,979
I can only hold up a mirror,

646
00:39:31,028 --> 00:39:32,606
make you slow down,

647
00:39:33,263 --> 00:39:34,674
look at the parts of yourself

648
00:39:34,698 --> 00:39:37,027
that you've been trying to ignore

649
00:39:37,467 --> 00:39:40,489
because you're afraid if you
look too closely, you'll break.

650
00:39:44,975 --> 00:39:46,912
Maybe you will. I don't know.

651
00:39:47,477 --> 00:39:49,582
Maybe breaking is the point.

652
00:39:54,451 --> 00:39:56,429
You can't outrun your pain, Dr. Lim.

653
00:39:56,453 --> 00:39:58,965
If you keep trying, it's gonna kill you.

654
00:41:16,199 --> 00:41:18,678
Time of death, 12:34.

655
00:41:18,702 --> 00:41:21,180
Time of death, 7:13.

656
00:41:21,204 --> 00:41:23,850
Time of death, 2:25.

657
00:41:23,874 --> 00:41:27,120
Time of death, 2100 hours.

658
00:41:27,144 --> 00:41:29,489
- Time of death...
- Time of death, 4:26.

659
00:41:29,513 --> 00:41:32,392
- Time of death...
- Time of death, 7:13.

660
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,726
- Time of death...
- ...4:26.

661
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:35,980
- ...8:55.
- Time of death...
