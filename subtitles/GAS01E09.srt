00:00:03,888 --> 00:00:07,551
<i>[Meredith] You know how when you were
a kid and you believed in fairy tales?</i>

2
00:00:07,625 --> 00:00:09,320
<i>[- Nellie McKay: David]</i>

3
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:15,161
<i>That fantasy of what your life would be.</i>

4
00:00:15,233 --> 00:00:17,463
<i>White dress, Prince Charming,</i>

5
00:00:17,535 --> 00:00:21,369
<i>who'd carry you away
to a castle on a hill.</i>

6
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,772
<i>You'd lie in bed at night
and close your eyes,</i>

7
00:00:24,843 --> 00:00:27,437
<i>and you had complete and utter faith.</i>

8
00:00:27,512 --> 00:00:29,503
[Sighs]

9
00:00:29,581 --> 00:00:33,039
Eight hours, 16 ounces of chocolate
and 32 cupcakes,

10
00:00:33,118 --> 00:00:35,052
and they still don't taste right.

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,712
No, these are good.

12
00:00:36,788 --> 00:00:38,517
Martha Stewart would be proud.

13
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:39,955
Yeah, look where it got her.

14
00:00:40,024 --> 00:00:44,120
<i>[Meredith] Santa Claus,
the Tooth Fairy, Prince Charming,</i>

15
00:00:44,195 --> 00:00:46,129
<i>they were so close, you taste them.</i>

16
00:00:46,197 --> 00:00:48,961
There's something missing,
some specific ingredient.

17
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:50,625
Why can't I remember?

18
00:00:50,702 --> 00:00:52,670
<i>But eventually, you grow up.</i>

19
00:00:52,737 --> 00:00:56,673
<i>One day you open your eyes,
and the fairy tale disappears.</i>

20
00:00:56,741 --> 00:00:59,141
Look, just call her.
Call your mother and ask.

21
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:02,179
<i>Most people turn to the things
and people they can trust.</i>

22
00:01:02,247 --> 00:01:03,908
I don't want to call my mother.

23
00:01:06,985 --> 00:01:09,510
So let's go sleep at your house tonight.

24
00:01:09,587 --> 00:01:11,054
What?

25
00:01:11,122 --> 00:01:12,987
Why are we always sleeping at my house?

26
00:01:13,057 --> 00:01:15,457
- Do you even have one?
- One what?

27
00:01:15,527 --> 00:01:17,893
A house. With a closet.

28
00:01:17,962 --> 00:01:21,489
With your stuff in it.
Your personal stuff.

29
00:01:21,566 --> 00:01:23,500
Do you even have one of those?

30
00:01:24,669 --> 00:01:26,102
Mmm.

31
00:01:26,171 --> 00:01:27,638
Good morning.

32
00:01:27,705 --> 00:01:30,139
- [George] Hey. You guys want a cupcake?
- Oh, no.

33
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:31,766
Izzie made them.

34
00:01:31,843 --> 00:01:33,105
I like it here.

35
00:01:33,178 --> 00:01:36,545
You said yourself,
you liked having your things around,

36
00:01:36,614 --> 00:01:38,275
sleeping in your own bed.

37
00:01:38,349 --> 00:01:39,976
You're like a health nut.

38
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,882
You eat muesli every morning.

39
00:01:44,155 --> 00:01:46,146
No, I don't.

40
00:01:46,224 --> 00:01:48,249
OK, the muesli thing, you do.

41
00:01:48,326 --> 00:01:49,884
The last seven days, at least.

42
00:01:49,961 --> 00:01:51,553
Oh, come on.

43
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:54,257
I haven't been here for a whole week.

44
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,866
- Have I?
- See?

45
00:01:57,936 --> 00:02:00,200
Even they think it's weird.

46
00:02:00,271 --> 00:02:02,432
<i>[Meredith] But the thing is,</i>

47
00:02:02,507 --> 00:02:05,806
<i>it's hard to let go
of that fairy tale entirely.</i>

48
00:02:05,877 --> 00:02:09,608
<i>Almost everyone still
has that smallest bit of hope,</i>

49
00:02:09,681 --> 00:02:13,117
<i>of faith, that one day
they'll open their eyes</i>

50
00:02:14,252 --> 00:02:16,880
<i>and it will all come true.</i>

51
00:02:23,828 --> 00:02:25,261
[Door opens]

52
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,161
So I've checked the schedule.

53
00:02:27,232 --> 00:02:29,757
I start ENT On the 9th.
It's a light rotation.

54
00:02:29,834 --> 00:02:31,563
Can you get me in then?

55
00:02:31,636 --> 00:02:33,797
Oh, I'm afraid not.

56
00:02:33,872 --> 00:02:36,739
We have openings on the 16th.

57
00:02:36,808 --> 00:02:41,074
There are other options
besides termination, you know?

58
00:02:41,145 --> 00:02:43,010
Adoption,

59
00:02:43,081 --> 00:02:45,413
keeping the baby.

60
00:02:45,483 --> 00:02:47,474
You think it over. Call me back.

61
00:02:47,552 --> 00:02:49,452
- I'm here...
- Put me down for the 16th.

62
00:02:49,521 --> 00:02:51,682
I'll confirm after
I rearrange my schedule.

63
00:02:52,824 --> 00:02:54,587
I know this is a difficult decision.

64
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:56,923
- You know the talking part?
- Mm.

65
00:02:56,995 --> 00:02:59,156
I'm not interested.

66
00:03:00,899 --> 00:03:03,834
So, Devo, you just
had a root canal, correct?

67
00:03:03,902 --> 00:03:04,960
Yeah.

68
00:03:05,036 --> 00:03:07,231
I couldn't stop bleeding after,
literally.

69
00:03:07,305 --> 00:03:10,035
Now I'm stuck with you guys.

70
00:03:10,108 --> 00:03:11,166
Give me the bullet.

71
00:03:11,242 --> 00:03:14,211
17-year-old female hospitalized
for excessive bleeding,

72
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:17,180
post root canal.
Also a significant new heart murmur

73
00:03:17,248 --> 00:03:20,308
associated with fever.
Now afebrile on antibiotics.

74
00:03:20,385 --> 00:03:22,319
If I'm gonna die,
page my mom and dad?

75
00:03:22,387 --> 00:03:24,480
You're not dying.
Where are your parents?

76
00:03:24,556 --> 00:03:27,923
In the cafeteria.
My freak father likes hospital food.

77
00:03:27,992 --> 00:03:32,156
[Burke] You're in excellent hands.
Dr. Karev is gonna run some labs.

78
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:35,825
And I'll see you with your parents
in a little while.

79
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,925
Add a bleeding time to the coags.

80
00:03:39,003 --> 00:03:42,769
So, what kind of name is Devo, anyway?

81
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,435
'80s rocker.
My parents did too much blow.

82
00:03:46,511 --> 00:03:48,672
I call myself Esther.

83
00:03:48,746 --> 00:03:50,680
Nice skirt. What are you, Amish?

84
00:03:50,748 --> 00:03:53,478
Get a life. Haven't you
ever seen an Orthodox Jew?

85
00:03:56,988 --> 00:04:00,048
This guy belongs in Psych.
What are you doing turfing him here?

86
00:04:00,124 --> 00:04:03,787
My gift to you. Had a seizure two
days ago and another one this morning.

87
00:04:03,861 --> 00:04:07,763
What are you talking about?
It says, "He talks to dead people,

88
00:04:07,832 --> 00:04:10,665
family thinks he's dangerous.
They had him committed."

89
00:04:10,735 --> 00:04:12,327
That's Psych, not Neuro.

90
00:04:12,403 --> 00:04:13,870
Didn't you go to med school?

91
00:04:13,938 --> 00:04:17,032
Yes, unlike the correspondence
school you attended...

92
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:20,703
- Oh, that would be Stanford, right?
- I learned not to jump to conclusions.

93
00:04:20,778 --> 00:04:23,576
Sorry, ladies. We can't take
him back until he's cleared.

94
00:04:23,648 --> 00:04:25,115
You're dumping him on us?

95
00:04:25,183 --> 00:04:27,014
He thinks his seizures are visions.

96
00:04:27,085 --> 00:04:29,383
Hello! They're not seizures.
I'm psychic.

97
00:04:29,454 --> 00:04:32,014
[Cristina] Of course you are,
and I'm a chicken.

98
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:34,149
Hey, genius.

99
00:04:36,094 --> 00:04:39,359
OK, Mr. Duff.
We're gonna start our workup now.

100
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,024
Work me up, work me down, waste of time.

101
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,534
Well, humor us.
Can you grip my fingers, please?

102
00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:52,771
Cristina.

103
00:04:52,844 --> 00:04:54,641
Mr. Duff?

104
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:57,044
Mr. Duff, are you OK?

105
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,009
[Breathes deeply] Someone...

106
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:03,980
Someone what?

107
00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:05,647
Someone's gonna check out.

108
00:05:05,723 --> 00:05:06,951
Bye-bye.

109
00:05:07,025 --> 00:05:08,185
Oh, man, he's nuts.

110
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:09,624
I'm dizzy, not deaf, lady.

111
00:05:09,694 --> 00:05:12,185
Someone on the fourth floor
is gonna die.

112
00:05:12,263 --> 00:05:16,029
<i>[Man over PA] Code blue,
fourth floor. Code blue, fourth floor.</i>

115
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,167

Fourth floor, dead guy.

119

The psychic predicted
the fourth floor dead guy.

120
00:06:10,822 --> 00:06:13,518
I need someone to cover me
on the 16th. You in?

121
00:06:14,392 --> 00:06:16,417
I'm thinking about letting my hair grow.

122
00:06:16,494 --> 00:06:19,793
And maybe I won't shave.
Go for the stubble effect.

123
00:06:19,864 --> 00:06:21,559
What do you think?

124
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:24,396
The 16th, George.
Can you cover me or not?

125
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:27,029
Uh, yeah. I guess. Why?

126
00:06:27,105 --> 00:06:29,835
It's none of your business.

127
00:06:29,907 --> 00:06:32,501
A thank-you would be nice.

128
00:06:32,577 --> 00:06:35,045
It's just that I hardly know
anything about you.

129
00:06:35,113 --> 00:06:36,910
I'm from New York. I like ferry boats.

130
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:39,609
Enough with the ferry boats.
What about your friends?

131
00:06:39,684 --> 00:06:43,017
- I'm a surgeon. I don't have friends.
- Everybody has friends.

132
00:06:43,087 --> 00:06:45,021
I mean, who do you hang out with?

133
00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:48,149
What do you do on your days off?
These are important questions.

134
00:06:48,226 --> 00:06:49,784
Ah, important for who?

135
00:06:49,861 --> 00:06:52,659
We're having sex every night.
I think I deserve details.

136
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:56,166
- You have more details than most.
- This is going somewhere weird.

137
00:06:56,234 --> 00:07:00,034
I want facts, and until I get them,
my pants are staying on.

138
00:07:00,104 --> 00:07:02,334
Or you could just roll with it.

139
00:07:02,406 --> 00:07:04,340

140
00:07:04,408 --> 00:07:06,000

Your daughter needs
a valve replacement.

149
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,361
Tests indicate von Willebrand's disease,

150
00:07:30,434 --> 00:07:33,301
which explains excessive
bleeding after the root canal.

151
00:07:33,371 --> 00:07:34,360
And that means?

152
00:07:34,438 --> 00:07:38,272
Devo can't take the blood thinners
to maintain a mechanical heart valve.

153
00:07:38,342 --> 00:07:40,640
We're suggesting
a porcine valve instead.

154
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:43,612
Porcine? As in pig?

155
00:07:43,681 --> 00:07:46,445
It's the standard of care
for someone in this situation.

156
00:07:46,517 --> 00:07:49,042
Pig, huh?

157
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,485
It's the other white meat.

158
00:07:50,555 --> 00:07:54,082
I don't care what you have
to do. Save my daughter's life.

I don't.

175
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:38,192
OK, Mr. Walker. Does that hurt?

176
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:41,204
I can't feel anything
until you get to my thigh.

177
00:08:41,272 --> 00:08:43,502
Try wiggling your toes.

178
00:08:44,675 --> 00:08:46,336
Are they moving?

179
00:08:47,345 --> 00:08:49,438
- No.
- Damn.

180
00:08:49,513 --> 00:08:51,606
I could about ten minutes ago.

181
00:08:51,682 --> 00:08:55,209
Well, your spine x-rays look clear.
You fell rock climbing?

182
00:08:55,286 --> 00:08:58,380
In Snohomish. Just a small drop.
I was belayed.

183
00:08:58,456 --> 00:09:01,220
My wife and boys are on the way.

184
00:09:01,292 --> 00:09:02,884
What's wrong with me, anyway?

185
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,484
Hold your legs up.

186
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,562
- Should I be scared now?
- Just try and relax.

187
00:09:11,636 --> 00:09:14,264
Nurse, I need a stat MRI.

188
00:09:14,338 --> 00:09:17,398
Send an intern with him.
Make it Meredith Grey.

189
00:09:17,475 --> 00:09:19,409
Mm-hmm.

190
00:09:19,477 --> 00:09:21,604
[Karev] Ew. Thick, short neck.

191
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:23,874
That isn't good. It's hard to intubate.

192
00:09:23,948 --> 00:09:26,576
- You want me to do that?
- He's my patient. I'm fine.

193
00:09:26,651 --> 00:09:29,085
I just can't see anything yet. Suction.

194
00:09:31,088 --> 00:09:32,749
Don't break any teeth.

195
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:34,586
I know... Don't you think I know?

196
00:09:38,396 --> 00:09:39,988
Pulse ox down 87 percent.

197
00:09:40,064 --> 00:09:41,622
Bag him.

198
00:09:42,733 --> 00:09:44,394
Sure you don't want me to do that?

199
00:09:44,468 --> 00:09:45,833
No, damn it! Tube.

200
00:09:45,903 --> 00:09:47,598
<i>[Rapid beeping]</i>

201
00:09:49,774 --> 00:09:51,867
[Grunting]

202
00:09:51,943 --> 00:09:53,274
There.

203
00:09:53,344 --> 00:09:55,005
Huh. Got it.

204
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:02,351
It's in the esophagus. Don't you
know an esophagus from a trachea?

205
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,411
[George] Anatomy
is messed up in here.

206
00:10:04,488 --> 00:10:06,649
You trying to kill
this patient, O'Malley?

207
00:10:08,426 --> 00:10:10,894
Maybe we can send you
to practice on mannequins.

208
00:10:10,962 --> 00:10:14,295
No, it's just I haven't done this much.

209
00:10:14,365 --> 00:10:17,801
But when I have, it's... it's been good.

210
00:10:19,537 --> 00:10:21,198
It's just l-I haven't...

211
00:10:21,272 --> 00:10:23,706
Let's review the concepts.

212
00:10:23,774 --> 00:10:26,072
Never take your eyes away.

213
00:10:26,143 --> 00:10:28,509
Always, always
know you can follow through.

214
00:10:29,347 --> 00:10:32,612
Don't ever follow through
on one of my patients, O'Malley.

215
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:47,798
Botox would do wonders
for all those frown lines.

216
00:10:47,865 --> 00:10:49,833
OK. Shut up.

217
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,629
You allowed to talk to me like that?

218
00:10:51,702 --> 00:10:53,260
[Hisses]

219
00:10:53,337 --> 00:10:56,272
God, you're hot...
in a Mrs. Livingston kind of way.

220
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,035
See here?

221
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:01,010
These are spikes in your temporal lobe.

222
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:03,808
It means you have epilepsy.
Not visions. Seizures.

223
00:11:03,881 --> 00:11:06,714
You think I'm epileptic?
That is so not right.

224
00:11:06,784 --> 00:11:09,947
I'm gonna order an MRI so I can
take a closer look at your brain.

225
00:11:10,021 --> 00:11:11,886
Yeah, there's no way...

226
00:11:16,727 --> 00:11:18,058
Mr. Duff?

227
00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:20,757
Mr. Duff, can you see me?
Can you hear me?

228
00:11:20,831 --> 00:11:21,889
Stay with me.

229
00:11:21,966 --> 00:11:24,935
I wouldn't have picked you
for the mommy track, Nurse Betty.

230
00:11:29,807 --> 00:11:30,831
See?

231
00:11:33,878 --> 00:11:36,176
I told you I know things.

232
00:11:36,247 --> 00:11:39,045
This pregnancy thing,
you can't run away from it.

233
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,426
Dr. Bailey, I want off the psychic case.

234
00:11:49,493 --> 00:11:51,518
I'll take whatever you got.
Can I switch?

235
00:11:51,595 --> 00:11:53,324
Ask nicely.

236
00:11:53,397 --> 00:11:56,628
Uh, well, this is me doing nicely.

237
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,466
Look, I know the type. These guys want
everybody to think they're a sideshow.

238
00:12:00,538 --> 00:12:03,166
- Let me take him.
- I don't do switches.

239
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,265
I'll do your post-op notes for a month.

240
00:12:06,343 --> 00:12:08,368
Fine. I can accept that.

241
00:12:08,446 --> 00:12:10,073
Izzie, you get Psych guy.

242
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:12,081
Yang. This is your lucky day.

243
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:14,049
You get to be with me on breast cancer.

244
00:12:14,118 --> 00:12:17,986
There's spotting. You'll need
to do a pelvic. She's pregnant.

245
00:12:29,233 --> 00:12:31,201
See? This.

246
00:12:31,268 --> 00:12:32,929
The guy's films are clear.

247
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:36,404
There's no reason I can see
for his creeping paralysis.

248
00:12:36,474 --> 00:12:38,339
It's just so surprising.

249
00:12:38,409 --> 00:12:42,607
I expected an intrusion into the spinal
space or bony spur in the pulposus.

250
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,942
Well, you were wrong.

251
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:46,175
You don't always get
what you expect, do you?

252
00:12:48,285 --> 00:12:49,946
What is your problem?

253
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,612
Give me something to go on.

254
00:12:51,689 --> 00:12:54,624
Anything. What are
your grandparents' names?

255
00:12:54,692 --> 00:12:56,785
- I don't have them.
- Where'd you grow up?

256
00:12:56,861 --> 00:12:58,624
Your favorite flavor of ice cream?

257
00:12:58,696 --> 00:13:00,891
Where'd you spend
your summer vacations?

258
00:13:00,965 --> 00:13:02,933
Lighten up.

259
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,025
Oh, don't you tell me to lighten up.

260
00:13:05,102 --> 00:13:07,730
I'll lighten up when I...

261
00:13:07,805 --> 00:13:10,035
...feel light.

262
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:15,611
Don't we have treatment options? L-I
mean, aren't there always alternatives?

263
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:18,147
With this stage of invasive carcinoma,

264
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:21,878
surgery, chemo, radiation
and drug therapy are your only options.

265
00:13:21,952 --> 00:13:23,886
Can I wait until the end
of my pregnancy?

266
00:13:23,954 --> 00:13:27,549
The pregnancy hormones will likely
speed the growth of the cancer.

267
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,092
And the baby?

268
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,891
None of these treatments
will allow the baby to survive.

269
00:13:32,963 --> 00:13:37,423
Mr. And Mrs. Glass,
I understand how difficult this is.

270
00:13:37,501 --> 00:13:39,833
No disrespect, but like hell, you do.

271
00:13:41,138 --> 00:13:44,972
You're going to have to make a decision
as to how you want to proceed.

272
00:13:45,042 --> 00:13:47,033
You mean my baby's life or my own?

273
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,008
Yes.

274
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:59,654
We'll have to evacuate the fetus.

275
00:14:02,293 --> 00:14:04,523
[Exhales]

276
00:14:07,064 --> 00:14:08,725
[Derek] Any changes, Mr. Walker?

277
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:10,790
[Mr. Walker] I can't move
my legs at all.

278
00:14:10,868 --> 00:14:12,665
He was moving his legs
when he came in.

279
00:14:12,736 --> 00:14:15,296
- What's wrong with him?
- I don't know.

280
00:14:15,372 --> 00:14:19,103
The paralysis is moving quickly,
and nothing in the MRI to explain it.

281
00:14:19,176 --> 00:14:22,771
- Has Tommy been under stress lately?
- You know what's making me stressed?

282
00:14:22,846 --> 00:14:25,314
Being in here
and not being able to move.

283
00:14:25,382 --> 00:14:27,043
Dr. Grey.

284
00:14:27,985 --> 00:14:29,714
Emotional trauma can be converted

285
00:14:29,787 --> 00:14:31,982
- into something physical?
- Possible.

286
00:14:32,056 --> 00:14:34,081
Like hysterical numbness or paralysis.

287
00:14:34,158 --> 00:14:38,117
Maybe there is no physiological reason,
and he's having a conversion reaction.

288
00:14:38,195 --> 00:14:40,993
- It's psychosomatic?
- It is not in your head, man.

289
00:14:41,065 --> 00:14:43,556
- I believe you.
- [Izzie] Mr. Duff, please.

290
00:14:46,003 --> 00:14:47,265
Who was that?

291
00:14:47,338 --> 00:14:49,670
Psych sent him down. He has visions.

292
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,970
Is that it? Am I crazy?

293
00:14:52,042 --> 00:14:54,135
No. No.

294
00:14:54,211 --> 00:14:57,339
I'm gonna order a higher-level MRI.

295
00:14:57,414 --> 00:14:59,507
We're gonna figure this out.

296
00:15:04,121 --> 00:15:06,089
You know how important this is to me!

297
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:07,817
This is about saving your life.

298
00:15:07,891 --> 00:15:10,382
You're not respecting it, or me.

299
00:15:10,461 --> 00:15:14,124
You're letting them put a pig,
a freaking non-kosher, traif mammal,

300
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:16,894
into my chest, into my heart!

301
00:15:16,967 --> 00:15:18,559
The very essence of my being!

302
00:15:18,636 --> 00:15:20,661
It's a porcine valve, actually.

303
00:15:20,738 --> 00:15:24,196
I don't care what it is. If you give
me a pig part, I might as well be dead.

304
00:15:24,275 --> 00:15:26,334
[Man] This Orthodox thing
was a mistake.

305
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:29,846
What was wrong with being
Reform like everyone else?

306
00:15:29,913 --> 00:15:32,347
You guys don't even
light candles Friday nights.

307
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,577
You don't know
all the Passover plagues.

308
00:15:34,652 --> 00:15:37,018
Boils, vermin, pestilence.
Even I know that.

309
00:15:38,922 --> 00:15:40,446
Miss Friedman,

310
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:43,152
I appreciate your extreme
religious convictions.

311
00:15:43,227 --> 00:15:44,956
Fire, hail...

312
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:47,793
Simply put,
without this procedure, you will die.

313
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:52,861
You're hotshot doctors.
You'll come up with something else.

314
00:15:52,936 --> 00:15:55,996
As long as it doesn't answer
to Wilbur and say "oink,"

315
00:15:56,073 --> 00:15:57,973
I don't care what it is.

316
00:16:08,185 --> 00:16:09,618
Your nostrils are flaring.

317
00:16:09,687 --> 00:16:10,711
They are not.

318
00:16:10,788 --> 00:16:12,119
You're into me. I can tell.

319
00:16:12,189 --> 00:16:14,282
"Dr. Small and Angry"
was a hot appetizer,

320
00:16:14,358 --> 00:16:17,054
but you, doc, are a smorgasbord of lust.

321
00:16:17,127 --> 00:16:19,220
Mr. Duff, you're pressing your luck.

322
00:16:19,296 --> 00:16:21,628
Would you press it for me?

323
00:16:21,699 --> 00:16:23,599
I hope you're not claustrophobic.

324
00:16:26,337 --> 00:16:28,032
You're staring at me. Stop it.

325
00:16:28,105 --> 00:16:31,199
I'm looking at you, sweetheart,
but it's the strangest thing.

326
00:16:31,275 --> 00:16:33,402
I'm hungry for a chocolate cupcake.

327
00:16:33,477 --> 00:16:36,310
- What did you say?
- A chocolate cupcake.

328
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:39,781
One of those fudgey things with
the white squiggle on the frosting.

329
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,044
Could you oblige?

330
00:16:42,886 --> 00:16:45,377
What, do I still have
some chocolate on my face

331
00:16:45,456 --> 00:16:47,117
or in my hair or something?

332
00:16:47,191 --> 00:16:49,216
- What are you talking about?
- You.

333
00:16:49,293 --> 00:16:51,557
I know the drill, so keep it up.

334
00:16:51,628 --> 00:16:56,031
Next you'll be reading my cards,
telling me my dead uncle is in the room.

335
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,864
- Is he?
- I don't have a dead uncle.

336
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:02,231
I'm watching you.

337
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:08,608
[Sniffs]

338
00:17:10,748 --> 00:17:12,340
[Whistling]

339
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:17,379
- If that's turkey, can I have some?
- It's soggy.

340
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:21,948
- It'll kill you. Solve everything.
- I am good at intubations.

341
00:17:22,025 --> 00:17:25,324
Why does everything in a hospital
smell like a hospital?

342
00:17:25,396 --> 00:17:28,160
Don't be so hard on yourself.
Everybody makes mistakes.

343
00:17:28,232 --> 00:17:29,563
I'm good at a lot of things.

344
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:32,158
I'm gonna tell you something.
You need to get laid.

She's single.
She's got red hair. Go ask her out.

347

- I intubated an esophagus.
- Dude, you're tweaking.

348
00:17:40,878 --> 00:17:44,678
- Maybe you should go see that psychic.
- Mr. Duff is not a psychic!

357

361

Well, not really, but it felt like it.

00:18:33,464 --> 00:18:36,900
It was like,
"Screw this. I want my life back."

Then one awesome night on the beach

I should have these labs back
in a couple hours.

You're 47 years old,

so statistically you have
a good probability of survival.

Forego treatment, chances are you
won't see your baby go to kindergarten,

it's gonna blow, we fix it, right?

516
00:26:54,664 --> 00:26:57,827
Can you tell me I'll survive
if I go through with this?

517
00:26:58,835 --> 00:27:02,737
Having the procedure does not
necessarily improve the outcome.

518
00:27:02,806 --> 00:27:05,274
You have quite the bedside manner.
You know that?

519
00:27:06,643 --> 00:27:10,477
My mom died of breast cancer
when she was in her 40s.

520
00:27:10,547 --> 00:27:12,014
I have that cancer gene.

521
00:27:12,082 --> 00:27:15,916
My chances are pretty much lose-Iose,
whichever way you look at it,

522
00:27:15,986 --> 00:27:17,283
except for the baby.

523
00:27:17,354 --> 00:27:19,049
We're keeping it.

524
00:27:20,957 --> 00:27:22,549
I'll call down a Psych consult.

525
00:27:22,625 --> 00:27:26,391
Don't bother.
I am going to get fat and happy

526
00:27:26,463 --> 00:27:28,431
instead of skinny and bald.

527
00:27:28,498 --> 00:27:30,591
- I'm at the end...
- If you want to live...

528
00:27:30,667 --> 00:27:33,534
Honey, that's what I'm doing.

529
00:27:47,117 --> 00:27:50,917
Look, if you think you're gonna get any,
think again.

530
00:27:50,987 --> 00:27:53,285
I'm not in the mood.

531
00:27:53,356 --> 00:27:56,291
- I'm not in the mood, either.
- Good.

532
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:01,929
What do you want?

533
00:28:01,998 --> 00:28:04,364
Nothing. I just
haven't seen you all day.

534
00:28:07,637 --> 00:28:09,628
So I'm working.

535
00:28:15,478 --> 00:28:18,641
I've never done
a bovine replacement before.

536
00:28:18,715 --> 00:28:20,478
I don't know what I'm doing.

537
00:28:21,918 --> 00:28:25,513
Look it up, research it
and get someone to assist you.

[Scoffs]

539
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:29,017
It's not that easy.

540
00:28:29,092 --> 00:28:32,255
This is a problem
that has a solution, Burke.

541
00:28:32,328 --> 00:28:34,489
There are a lot of problems that don't.

542

<i>[Monitor beeping]</i>

543
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:42,738
Third thoracic laminae. Nothing.

544
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:45,172
I think I see the dura pulsating here.

545
00:28:45,241 --> 00:28:48,870
- No, it's not. Keep looking.
- We have been at this for four hours.

546
00:28:48,945 --> 00:28:52,210
Maybe he just injured his spinal cord,
and there's nothing to fix.

547
00:28:52,282 --> 00:28:55,809
Grey, when you read your books,
make sure you reference them correctly.

548
00:28:55,885 --> 00:28:58,547
Progressive paralysis
implies a pressure lesion.

549
00:28:58,621 --> 00:29:00,179
My books got me here...

550

00:29:02,058 --> 00:29:05,221

552
00:29:05,295 --> 00:29:06,489
What is it?

I'm pushing 70 milligrams Diazoxide.

- Damage to the nervous system?

- We're in trouble?
- We've got to find the clot.

557
00:29:19,843 --> 00:29:22,073
I can see the cord below the dura.

558
00:29:22,145 --> 00:29:24,113
Focus, Grey. We're gonna find the clot.

559
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:27,513
It's there. Cleanup, please.

560
00:29:27,584 --> 00:29:30,246
BP's still up. Heart rate's at 44.

Get on those bleeders.

Dr. O'Malley?
Our patient's pulse ox is dropping.

00:29:46,136 --> 00:29:48,263
She's agonal. She needs to be intubated.

566
00:29:48,338 --> 00:29:50,203
Is there anyone else who can do this?

567
00:29:50,273 --> 00:29:55,040
- You're here. I could find someone.
- No, that's... I got it.

How long would it take
to get a cow valve?

Oh, about 60 minutes by messenger.

Thank you very much, sir.

582
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,384
This doesn't get you any points, Karev.

I'm the only one
with points around here, OK?

Oh, by the way,

- Is he gonna be OK?
- I think so.

But you don't know that.

601
00:32:02,939 --> 00:32:05,100
We stopped the paralysis from advancing.

602
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:08,405
You don't know if the paralysis
he already has will be permanent.

603
00:32:08,478 --> 00:32:09,672
No.

604
00:32:09,746 --> 00:32:11,907

Some people
would call this a relationship.

Come on. We all know he's crazy.

00:37:08,878 --> 00:37:10,812
You said you didn't believe in that.

673
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,649
I grew up in a trailer park.

674
00:37:15,718 --> 00:37:19,051
I waited tables, which was
supposed to put me through college,

675
00:37:19,121 --> 00:37:22,648
but my mother was always calling these

677
00:37:26,462 --> 00:37:29,590

so I had to use my money to pay them.

678

When I turned 18,
I left and never went back.

saying things to me,

things he couldn't possibly
know anything about.

681
00:37:39,508 --> 00:37:42,773
So I just wonder.

682
00:37:46,048 --> 00:37:48,482
Do you have sensation anywhere else?

683
00:37:48,551 --> 00:37:51,247
Some feeling in my stomach
and feet, I guess.

684
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:54,050
- Bladder and bowels?
- Not so good still.

00:38:09,038 --> 00:38:12,030

that I wasn't making it up.

689
00:38:16,045 --> 00:38:18,707
Well, I'll come back tomorrow, then.

690
00:38:18,781 --> 00:38:20,976
[Mr. Walker] I wanted
to show you something.

691
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:23,951
I wasn't sure it would last,
but now look.

692
00:38:27,323 --> 00:38:29,154
I know it's hardly anything, but...

693
00:38:29,225 --> 00:38:31,591
No, it's something.

694
00:38:33,029 --> 00:38:34,462
It's something really big.

695
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:36,054
<i>[- Tegan and Sara: Fix You Up]</i>

696
00:38:40,236 --> 00:38:45,003
<i>[Meredith] At the end
of the day, faith is a funny thing.</i>

697
00:38:46,542 --> 00:38:50,000
<i>It turns up when
you don't really expect it.</i>

698
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,515
Mr. Duff, you're still with us.

699
00:38:55,685 --> 00:38:57,380
For your recipe...

700
00:38:59,989 --> 00:39:03,356
...one tablespoon coconut extract.

701
00:39:05,227 --> 00:39:09,425
<i>[Meredith] It's like one day
you realize that the fairy tale</i>

702
00:39:09,498 --> 00:39:12,990
<i>may be slightly different
than you dreamed.</i>

703
00:39:19,475 --> 00:39:21,636
[Car alarm beeping]

704
00:39:21,711 --> 00:39:23,702
Where are we going?

705
00:39:25,414 --> 00:39:26,881
Trust me.

706
00:39:32,221 --> 00:39:34,951
<i>[Meredith] The castle, well...</i>

707
00:39:35,024 --> 00:39:37,891
<i>... it may not be a castle.</i>

708
00:39:53,576 --> 00:39:56,670
Does it beat or moo?

709
00:39:56,746 --> 00:40:00,739
<i>And it's not so important
that it's happy ever after.</i>

710
00:40:02,284 --> 00:40:05,117
<i>Just that it's happy right now.</i>

711
00:40:20,169 --> 00:40:21,761
<i>[Ringing]</i>

712
00:40:21,837 --> 00:40:24,806
Mom. It's me. Cricket.

713
00:40:24,874 --> 00:40:26,569
<i>[Meredith] See, once in a while,</i>

714
00:40:26,642 --> 00:40:29,702
<i>once in a blue moon,
people will surprise you.</i>

715
00:40:29,779 --> 00:40:32,145
I've been thinking about you a lot too.

716
00:40:35,417 --> 00:40:36,748
Where are we?

717
00:40:36,819 --> 00:40:39,219
Shh, shh. I'm gonna tell you.

718
00:40:39,288 --> 00:40:40,312
All right.

719
00:40:40,389 --> 00:40:42,254
My mother's maiden name, Maloney.

720
00:40:42,324 --> 00:40:43,655
I have four sisters.

721
00:40:43,726 --> 00:40:46,923
I have, uh, nine nieces.

722
00:40:46,996 --> 00:40:48,554
Five nephews.

723
00:40:48,631 --> 00:40:51,930
I like coffee ice cream,
single-malt scotch,

724
00:40:52,001 --> 00:40:54,993
occasionally a good cigar.
I like to fly-fish.

725
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:57,538
I cheat when I do the
crossword puzzle on Sunday.

726
00:40:57,606 --> 00:40:59,665
And I never dance in public.

727
00:40:59,742 --> 00:41:03,007
<i>Um, favorite novel, The Sun Also Rises.</i>

728
00:41:03,078 --> 00:41:04,807
Favorite band, The Clash.

729
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,145
My favorite color is blue.
I don't like light blue. Indigo.

730
00:41:08,217 --> 00:41:09,912
The scar right here on my forehead,

731
00:41:09,985 --> 00:41:13,011
that's why I don't ride
motorcycles anymore.

732
00:41:13,088 --> 00:41:15,079
And I live in that trailer.

733
00:41:17,693 --> 00:41:20,127
All this land is mine.

734
00:41:20,196 --> 00:41:22,687
I have no idea
what I'm gonna do with it.

735
00:41:22,765 --> 00:41:24,255
So that's it.

736
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:26,267
That's all you've earned for now.

737
00:41:26,335 --> 00:41:28,860
The rest you're just...

738
00:41:28,938 --> 00:41:31,304
...just gonna have to take on faith.

739
00:41:42,351 --> 00:41:46,048
<i>[Meredith] And once in a while...</i>

740
00:41:46,121 --> 00:41:49,318
<i>... people may even take
your breath away.</i>
