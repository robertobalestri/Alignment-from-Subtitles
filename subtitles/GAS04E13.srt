1
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:07,410
great surgeons aren't
made, they're born.

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:13,540
It takes gestation,incubation,
sacrifice... a lot of sacrifice.

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,800
But after all the blood and guts
and gooey stuff is washed away,

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,360
that surgeon you become?

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,670
Totally worth it.

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,470
welcome back.

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,060
Uh,I am not back.

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,470
I am here for a surgery.

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,740
I know.

10
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,930
Uh,chart,labs,uh,security key card
and key to the doctors' lounge.

11
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:34,440
Oh,look.

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:35,800
Theysed my old picture.

13
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:37,590
it's like I never left.

14
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,450
Addie,you're back.

15
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:40,660
I am not back.

16
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,950
Oh,you're back.

17
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:46,170
You're gonna smell the stink and sweat
of surgery,and you're gonna be back.

18
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,520
See?Nothing ever
changes around here.

19
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:49,910
Things change.

20
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:50,760
Welcome back.

21
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:52,470
I am not back!

22
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,340
well,I just had no idea that
sunrise yoga would be so intense.

23
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:58,210
Told ya.

24
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:02,870
dr. Hahn,I have the 3-d,uh,ultrasounds
and the fetal M.R.I.S for today's patient.

25
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:04,550
Have you decided
who's gonna scrub in?

26
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:06,840
Because I diagnosed the mother
when she came into the clinic,so...

27
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,330
films.

28
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,070
my first day.

29
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:19,020
My clinical trial.

30
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,560
My baby,all grown up.

31
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,330
You know,nobody cares about your
clinical trial or your sick,sick,

32
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,460
terminal patients,who'd
probably rather be left for dead.

33
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,040
- You're just jealous.
- Well,yeah.

34
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,900
Anyone can come up
with a clinical trial.

35
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,330
I could come up with
a clinical trial.

36
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:30,930
jealous.

37
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:33,360
Not that it would matter,' cause
hahn wouldn't sign off on it.

38
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,810
You know she won't even talk to me?

39
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,410
She always enjoyed talking to me.

40
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,200
Really,about what?

41
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,270
Her hopes,her dreams,then we
would braid each other's hair.

42
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,910
Well,at least I'm not
living in the clinic.

43
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,970
Hey,I like the clinic.

44
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,010
The clinic is my happy place.

45
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,420
Will you use your sparkle pager to
get me in on hahn's surgery today?

46
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,410
Oh,cristina,I can't even
think about the sparkle pager

47
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,370
because my clinical
trial starts today.

48
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,450
Sparkle pager stealer!

49
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,490
Thank you.

50
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,120
Okay,the both of you need to just
take a moment and dig down deep,

51
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,370
and you'll discover when you
do you're truly happy for me

52
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,010
hthat I have found
my@ath to medical history.

53
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,290
I'm not happy for me.

54
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,300
Oh,me neither.

55
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,880
His karnofsky score is
still 80,and his C.B.C.

56
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,350
And liver enzymes are good.

57
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,510
Well,that's better than expected.

58
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,080
I know.

59
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,050
Better doesn't mean good.

60
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,290
I don't want you getting emotionally
involved with these patients.

61
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,720
I don't want you
getting your hopes up.

62
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,110
My hopes are not up.

63
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,650
All right,then,dr.
Grey,let's do this.

64
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,720
Okay. Good.

65
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,050
Chart please.

66
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,520
Come here,you.

67
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,400
it's,uh...

68
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,020
wow,it's great to see you guys.

69
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,780
How's L.A.?

70
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,260
Oh,it's great.It's fun.

71
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,900
You know,it's the
sun and,uh,surfing.

72
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,290
- It's...
- you surf?

73
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,160
No,I-I don't surf,but...

74
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,760
So anyway,hey,look,I
hugged you there.

75
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,970
Did you see that I hugged you?

76
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,480
You stole my husband
from me,I hugged you.

77
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,220
I...I've grown.

78
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,130
I have,and,uh,I can be happy
for the happy couple,right?

79
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,130
I'm all L.A.

80
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,970
And,like... whew...one with myself.

81
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,040
So I feel really...

82
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:02,540
yeah.

83
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:04,880
- Okay.
- Yeah.

84
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,420
Well,I'm gonna go save a life now.

85
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,740
Okay.

86
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,340
Really,great... great
to see you,really.

87
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,500
Cheers.Happy couple?

88
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,020
See you after rounds..

89
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,710
There she is.

90
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,760
Just coming in to check
on my patient's skin flap.

91
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,140
Well,amazing,right?

92
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:27,220
I pulled a couple of stem
cells from the baby in utero,

93
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,430
six weeks later,I have
grown skin,like god.

94
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,620
Nice.

95
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,840
What do you say we lock that door
and tear one off for old time's sake?

96
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,750
This place is exactly the same.

97
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,500
You are exactly the same.

98
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,840
Except now I grow
skin for babies...

99
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,220
like god.Come on.I'm horny.

100
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,980
The nurses have shut me down.

101
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,090
Thanks for my skin flap.

102
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,790
That a euphemism?

103
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,060
Nope.

104
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,770
I am so coding.

105
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:56,790
Coding hard.

106
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:57,440
What is that?

107
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,230
Is that complaining?

108
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,060
'Cause if you're gonna
complain, just do it to my face.

109
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,850
Fine.There's nothing
to do down here.

110
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,210
Can we please go to
the pit or sothing?

111
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,720
you're down here to learn
patient care bedside manner

112
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,240
and a whole host of things
you cannot learn in the pit,

113
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,930
so suck it up.

114
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:14,840
dr. Stevens.

115
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,180
What seems to be
your problem today?

116
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,630
We,um...

117
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,680
my wife thinks she may be pregnant.

118
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,200
Okay,uh,we'll get you a test...

119
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,110
Excuse me,won't you?

120
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,530
What is wrong with you people?

121
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:29,590
And what is that smell?

122
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,740
Is that...

123
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:32,880
is that scotch?

124
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,450
It's seeping out of leo's pores.

125
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,660
You're hungover?

126
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,860
You're all hungover?

127
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,420
Don't blame us.Blame o'malley.

128
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,080
George?

129
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,390
He and lexie grey had a party.

130
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,840
George had a party?

131
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:48,080
Okay,people,you're about to
experience medical history,

132
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,110
medical greatness,medical majesty.

133
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,840
You're about to experience the
beginning of something extraordinary.

134
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,750
Take in the moment.

135
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,340
Okay,dr. Grey,did you warn
the interns on what to expect?

136
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,750
I told them to expect greatness.

137
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,040
Yes,in addition to
all the greatness,

138
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:06,140
the patient may be
inappropriately emotional,

139
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:08,490
which means he's
aggressive,uh,abusive.

140
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,570
Don't take it personally,okay?

141
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:10,170
Don't engage.

142
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,460
Just realize it's the
tumor talking,okay?

143
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,410
mr. Robinson,mrs.Robinson,

144
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,510
dr. Grey and I want to say
once again how grateful we are

145
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,730
that you've decided to
participate in our clinical trial.

146
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,610
I know it's a very
hard decision to make.

147
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,120
But it is a chance,right?

148
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,630
It's,like,our only chance?

149
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,220
well,if the surgery doesn't
kill me,the tumor will.

150
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,740
What have I got to lose,right?

151
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,400
well,as we discussed,the treatment
has never been tested on humans before.

152
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,900
We're going to inject a
live vus into the tumor.

153
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,310
And since we can't we take the tumor out,
our hope is to reduce thtumor from within.

154
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,350
dr. O'malley.

155
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,880
Over the past month,mr. Robinson
has experienced worsening vision loss

156
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,510
and increasingly severe headaches.

157
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:49,210
That in c... yes?

158
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,470
Nice,huh?

159
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,550
First thing I noticed
about her...hell of an ass.

160
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,700
You like a nice piece of ass,kid?

161
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,510
Admittedly,she could do
with a little more on top.

162
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,940
He's also started picking
out new husbands for me.

163
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,810
Was anyone talking to you?!

164
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,810
It's the tumor talking.

165
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,730
Yeah,it's just the tumor talking.

166
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,580
So you single or what?

167
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,890
dr. Montgomery.

168
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,450
dr. Karev.

169
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,250
- We're hugging?
- Yep.

170
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,780
I hug now.

171
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,250
It's what I do,so...

172
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,720
so you're my guy,huh?

173
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:32,230
You think I'd let anyone
else in on a case like this?

174
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,810
Uh,I'll catch up
with you in a second.

175
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,290
Okay.

176
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,880
you,uh,you don't own a phone?

177
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,970
I needed to see you I-in person.

178
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,060
I have a really huge case today.

179
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,550
I wish I could hang
out,I really do,

180
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,650
- but I...
- I'm pregnant.

181
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,270
didn't mean to blurt it.

182
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,750
I'm sorry I blurted it,but I
c... you never have time to talk,

183
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,660
so I-I kinda had no
choice but to blurt.

184
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,780
Are you keeping it or are
you having an abortion?

185
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,770
I have a really big case.

189
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,190
Ectopia cordis...

190
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,050
the baby's heart is growing
outside of its body in utero.

191
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,280
Less than 200 cases
have ever been reported.

192
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:29,750
Only a handful have survived.

193
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,690
I was on one of these
cases ten years ago.

194
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,760
The baby squeezed its own
heart in utero and died.

195
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:37,640
He squeezed his own heart
with his tiny,little hands?

196
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:40,460
Richard,you said there's a
possibility of a diaphragmatic hernia?

197
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,860
Yeah.

198
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,680
You and I have got a lot of
work to do on this little guy.

199
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,700
You up for it?

200
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,490
Always.

201
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:51,620
What about my work?

202
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,890
I grew an amazing flap
of the baby's own skin.

203
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,820
Pretend all you want, but
I know you're impressed.

204
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,610
you are going to...

205
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,890
what's up,dr.o'malley?

206
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:04,900
You.

207
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,590
o'malley's in the house.

208
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,850
Hey,you paged me?

209
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,180
O'malley,'sup,party dude?

210
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,840
Want to know what I
did last night,george?

211
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:17,840
I googled recipes.

212
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,870
I spent the night
with a search engine.

213
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:24,460
Oh,but that was just...
it was so spontaneous.I...

214
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,830
think you'd want to
hang out with interns.

215
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,060
- Code.
- Code.

216
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:29,400
what is that?

217
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:32,570
Oh,it's just something we
came... well,he came up with.

218
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,010
He coded.

219
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,000
- you coded.
- You coded.

220
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,150
It was really funny after
seven or eight shots.

221
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,250
you coded.

222
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,220
Um,so we're all set for tonight.

223
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,080
Tonight?

224
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,350
What's tonight?

225
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:50,750
the interns,we're... we're just having
a little darts tournament thing at joe'S.

226
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,230
Oh,my god.I love darts.

227
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,620
Oh,do you wanna...
do you wanna come?

228
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,440
Yeah,absolutely.Yay.

229
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,630
ya so coded.

230
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:07,000
You know,I thought,I don't know,
that it would be weird coming back,

231
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:13,960
but I gotta say,I find it strangely
comforting that everything is the same here.

232
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,660
Okay,in L.A.,People say
things,but in seattle,

233
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,650
there's this strange culture of
wordlessness wherein I am supposed to suss

234
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:29,150
what one is feeling by the slight raise
of an eyebrow or the beginnings of a frown.

235
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,380
There any chance you want to tell
me what's going on with you,miranda?

236
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,340
Just...

237
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:37,290
just a lot has
changed since you left.

238
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38,170
- Just a lot.
- Oh,come on.

239
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:41,030
Name one thing that has
changed in this hospital.

240
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,330
The clinic is
actually making money.

241
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,240
The chief's wife left him.

242
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:48,630
Derek and meredith
broke up and I...

243
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,970
J... derek and meredith broke up?

244
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,110
Uh,like I said,a lot
of things have changed.

245
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:00,430
Nikki jones,25-year-old
female, 35 weeks pregnant.

246
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,430
Six weeks ago,she was
diagnosed with ectopia cordis.

247
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,960
which,as you know,means
that your baby's heart

248
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,760
is currently growing on
the outside of his body.

249
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:11,800
Which doesn't get any less
bizarre the more times I hear it.

250
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,250
Not bizarre,baby.

251
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,120
Just unique.

252
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,920
Our son is one of a kind...
wearing his heart on his sleeve.

253
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,180
This surgery is going to
take place in two O.R.S.

254
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,870
It'll...it will work like a dance.

255
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,600
dr. Karev and i will
begin with the delivery.

256
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,000
And I'll stay behind to
close your incision,nikki.

257
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,510
While I bring your baby to O.R.Two.

258
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,380
Where I'll work on
your baby's heart.

259
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,990
And I'll attend to your
baby's intestinal problem.

260
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,550
What intestinal problem?

261
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,740
We've detected there might be a
slight defect on your baby's diaphragm.

262
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,940
We just want to be prepared
for every contingency.

263
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:49,060
I just wish I could keep him
inside me,keep him protected.

264
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:55,020
he's protected no matter
what, by us,by our love.

265
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,190
Something about that guy makes
me just want to punch him out.

266
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:02,370
And yet you didn't, for
which I amrateful,karev.

267
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,180
hippies...

268
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,540
annoying,huh?

269
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,620
Go away.

270
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,660
How great is she?

271
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:14,500
She's great.

272
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,210
Did I tell you?

273
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,120
You told me.

274
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,170
Did she tell you?

275
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:17,970
Tell me what?

276
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,360
Anything,everything.

277
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,620
does she know you're divorced?

278
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,380
- You're divorced?
- Yeah.

279
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,080
Which,as it turns out...

280
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,320
was the best thing that
could've happened,really.

281
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,070
no kidding?

282
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,080
- Are you headed...
- yeah.

283
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,090
- All right,I'll walk with you.
- Okay.

284
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,690
All right,well,you know...

285
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,650
so it seems like there's been a lot
of change,even since the last checkup.

286
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,810
His behavior's been
getting more erratic?

287
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,590
That's a nice way of putting it.

288
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,320
Well,you've been
incredibly strong,jennifer.

289
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,570
This is...

290
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,660
you've been incrediblytrong.

291
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:53,950
you know,if you
really want to help,

292
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:56,520
dr. Grey,you could
bring some single men by.

293
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:58,830
Phillip...

294
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,440
please stop.

295
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:03,440
Jennifer,we're in a hospital
full of eligible doctors,

296
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,430
and you're a waitress
with no prospects

297
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,940
who needs to learn how to use her ass to
catch a new guy before I bite the dust!

298
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:15,410
It's just the tumor talking.

299
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,850
It's just the tumor talking.

300
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:21,390
It is.It's just the tumor talking.

301
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:31,660
and he's laughing again,because the idea
of me with another man is just hilarious.

302
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,800
No,no,it's not.

303
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,330
I-I just can't see.

304
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,580
What?What can't you see?

305
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,310
I-I...anything.

306
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,920
I'm blind.

307
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,310
No response to light.

308
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:56,040
If I remember correctly,you're
a good-looking guy,right?

309
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:02,780
You know,just 'cause I'm blind doesn't mean
you can ignore me,you sick,twisted bastard!

310
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:06,690
Playing games with people's lives,
slicing open people's brains...

311
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,020
mr. Robinson,I'M...

312
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:15,740
I'm sorry,but I believe it's possible
the tumor is infiltrating the optic nerve.

313
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:19,940
We should consider moving the
surgery, maybe even doing it today.

314
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,860
what about you,dr. Grey?

315
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,740
You're a sexy little thing.

316
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:31,640
You think,uh,dr. Shepherd here
is attractive enough for my wife?

317
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:41,570
jennifer...

318
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,560
this isn't easy,I know.

319
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:46,470
My husband is probably
gonna die today.

320
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,270
We're moving up the
surgery,and he might die,

321
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,500
and all he can do is try
to fix me up with other men.

322
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:56,480
And I know,I know it's the
tumor talking,but if he dies,

323
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:00,970
my last memory is going to be
of him calling me a piece of ass.

324
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:07,620
I'm not involved and
my hopes are not up.

325
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,290
I'm having trouble finding
a heartbeat on an ultrasound.

326
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,320
That's what happens,dr. Guzman,
when you've had scotch for dinner.

327
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,240
It's hard to follow the basics.

328
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,830
Oh,rebecc hi.

329
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,740
Um,I really didn't
want an ultrasound.

330
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,380
I just wanted to get something
for the morning sickness.

331
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,060
It's really bad.

332
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,220
So y're pregnant?

333
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,070
Yeah.

334
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,810
Just like five weeks or so.

335
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,450
Uh,yeah,an ultrasound can be
pretty hard to read this early on,

336
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,170
so let's just take a blood sample,

337
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,110
and,uh,make sure
everything's on track.

338
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:42,380
Okay.

339
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,440
dr. Stevens...

340
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,920
do you know when dr. Karev
will be out of surgery?

341
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,400
I just wanted to say hi.

342
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,840
Um,I,uh,I-I don't know
that he's gone in yet.

343
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:55,730
You broke up with meredith grey?

344
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,350
Well,we're doing a clinical trial
together if that makes you feel better.

345
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:01,980
Derek,I hugged her... hugged her... and
you're not even together with her anymore?

346
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,750
What the hell happened?

347
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,020
Okay,fine.

348
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,670
Tell me about the clinical trial.

349
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,860
Well,if it doesn't go well,
I'm killing people f sport.

350
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,790
When I walk into an
O.R.,I'm an expert.

351
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,530
I can stop a bleed,I
can remove a clot.

352
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:16,590
I'm the expert.

353
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,810
But in a clinical triaL...

354
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,960
I'm experimenting, just
groping around in the dark,

355
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,180
hoping to do the right thing.

356
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,520
She wants greatness from me.

357
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,720
She's expecting greatness.

358
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,560
Okay,seriously,derek,what
are you doing?

359
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,770
I'm seeing somebody else.

360
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,700
She's lovely.

361
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,360
She's really lovely.

362
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,740
Hey.

363
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,760
- You came.
- Yeah.

364
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,060
Y-you have to stop paging me.

365
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,400
I can't deal with this right now.

366
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:49,960
All right?

367
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:50,880
I have a really big case today

368
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:52,680
- and I just can't deal with...
- I am just as scared .

369
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,210
- and confused about this as you are
- I'm not scared.

370
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,880
I'm just...

371
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,430
look,y-you don't want me,okay?

372
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,600
This...this is not a
thing you want me for.

373
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,680
I won't be good at it.

374
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,960
I...I'm...I'm not father material.

375
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,140
I mean...

376
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,140
you have a husband.

377
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,500
He doesn't have to know
that it's mine,okay?

378
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:09,620
No.No,it's not okay.

379
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:14,170
Alex,I'm just asking you to
get over yourself for one minute

380
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:17,190
and talk to me so we can
figure this thing out...

381
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,800
together.

382
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,760
I have to go.

383
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:29,750
I'm gonna be making the
incision from here to here,

384
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,060
- and...
- excuse me.

385
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:33,460
What you said before about
further complications...

386
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,410
no,we can't think like that.

387
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:37,210
There's nothing
else wrong with him.

388
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,240
Our intention is to
have a healthy baby.

389
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,810
He'll be strong
and happy anhealthy.

390
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,300
Don't you understand what
we're trying to tell you?

391
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,100
I mean,chances are your baby's gonna need a
hell of a lot more than just heart surgery.

392
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,110
dr. Karev.

393
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,320
Chances are he won'T.

394
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:53,150
You can't cross your fingers or close
your eyes and hope this will all go awaY.

395
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,430
dr. Karev.

396
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,110
He's not prepared.

397
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,730
I was trying to prepare him.

398
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,570
They're having a baby,and that
baby is gonna be all screwed up

399
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,820
because he's coming into a world
where his parents are unprepared.

400
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,450
They want to talk
about loving each other,

401
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,930
as if... as if that
has anything to do

402
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,480
with having the ability to
raise a baby... a sick baby.

403
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,240
He's not prepared.

404
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,660
I was trying to prepare him.

405
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:19,650
Karev,right now you're feeling all
your feelings right out in the open.

406
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:22,960
Do me a favor and
stuff them back in.

407
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,970
Interesting advice.

408
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,610
Don't start with me.

409
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,260
she's no longer
allowed in my apartment,

410
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,120
so no more tea parties or wine
parties or whatever you two have.

411
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:41,340
What?What are you talking about?

412
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,040
She's completely unfair
and she refuses to teache.

413
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,560
Okay,I got in at mass gen,
I got in at johns hopkins.

414
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,030
I could have gone anywhere,
and she won't teach me!

415
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,490
All right,look,erica...
she's a really good listener.

416
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:54,180
She's...she comes
off harsh at first...

417
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,300
But she's got a really good heart.

418
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:59,650
So just tell her how you feel,okay?

419
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,540
tell her how I feel?

420
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,110
Well,I don't speak girl.

421
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,590
Sorry about that.

422
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,640
Did I mention I live with yang now?

423
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,900
What?Why are you
looking at me like that?

424
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:18,200
Callie...

425
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:19,890
Are you speaking the...

426
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,310
vagina monologues now?

427
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,080
What?

428
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,060
I'm all for it,okay?

429
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,190
I think it's fantastic.

430
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,720
Erica... I mean,she seems great.

431
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,130
I really do like her,actually.

432
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,910
I do,and...but are you?

433
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:35,910
you want to know if erica
and i are a-a-a couple?

434
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:38,330
Because I defended her to yang?

435
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:42,130
Because you seem like a
couple, a really happy couple.

436
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,260
okay,that'S...

437
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,460
that's...that's just...

438
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,360
that's...that's insane
is...is...is what it is.

439
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,510
I'm...I-I-I
like penis.

440
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:54,810
I mean,I'a huge,huge fan of penis.

441
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,010
Hilarious.

442
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:58,090
You've been living in
los angeles way too long.

443
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,410
way too long.

444
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,390
Hilari...

445
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,610
george.

446
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:05,750
George.

447
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,900
George.

448
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,350
Hey,listen.

449
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,390
I am just the messenger,

450
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,340
but you should know that people are prepared
to drop out of the tournament tonight.

451
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:17,190
Nobody wants to get drunk and
play darts with their boss.

452
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,070
You want me to take
back the invitation?

453
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:21,640
I'm just the messenger.

454
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,200
Y... what's that about?

455
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:30,630
More special plans with
your special friends?

456
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,150
I would like us to talk today.

457
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:35,370
I would like us to talk because...

458
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:39,090
I care and I,uh,want to know things

459
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,400
and I-I-I have 15 minutes
to hear about your feelings.

460
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,380
So...

461
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,500
alex...

462
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,300
alex,you look thoughtful.

463
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:50,700
I'm verynterested to hear... I
mean,uh,what are your thoughts?

464
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,070
no.

465
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,570
Uh,izzie,uh,your
thoughts,your feelings?

466
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:56,530
Honestly?

467
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,150
I'm a little worried
about my friend alex here

468
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:02,780
because his jane doe girlfriend keeps showing
up like something out of "fatal attraction.

469
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:05,330
"Her name is rebecca pope,
and she's not my girlfriend.

470
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,940
Really?You guys haven'T...

471
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,710
had sex...

472
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,890
at all recently?

473
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,760
She's married,okay?

474
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:12,530
She has a husband.

475
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,850
Well,does it hurt that
y... she's married?

476
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,930
I mean,does that hurt
your... your heart?

477
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:17,990
What's the matter with you?

478
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,640
I'm tryingo talk girl.

479
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,230
Well...ya coded.

480
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,250
right?

481
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,930
what?It's a new slang.

482
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,140
Everybody's saying it.

483
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:33,080
the way you just said
that, that was you coding.

484
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,210
whatever.

485
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:40,060
Unlike meredith with her
trials and petri dishes,

486
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,010
and cristina,who has to practice
talking like a human being...

487
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,280
I actually care abt patient care.

488
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,250
I need the sparkle pager.

489
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,700
She's not giving you
the sparkle pager.

490
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,700
Well,you know what?I
can't talk girl.

491
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,530
And I shouldn't have to talk girl
'cause I diagnosed the patient.

492
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,470
I need the pager.

493
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:55,860
you can't have the sparkle pager.

494
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,770
No,give it to me.

495
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,890
Give it to me.

496
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:03,470
anyone,uh,anyone ever think
you two were a-a couple?

497
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,850
No,because we screw boys
like whores on tequila.

498
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,400
And then we either try to
marry them or drown ourselves.

499
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:15,770
well,um,make hahn let me scrub
in, or i'm making you move out.

500
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,560
- What?You...
- desperate times.

501
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:22,370
I'm sorry that took so long.

502
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,200
Congratulations.

503
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,390
You're pregnant.

504
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,650
You're sure?

505
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,870
It's a big day for pregnant ladies.

506
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,200
Pregnant ladies everywhere I turn.

507
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:29,810
It's weird.

508
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:31,580
So I'm only supposed to
give you a couple of these,

509
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,610
but this is,like,a month's
supply of prenatal vitamins...

510
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:35,920
- samples,they're free.
- No,I...

511
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:38,930
we need to schedule an abortion.

512
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,630
O-okay.

513
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,680
uh,I'm sorry.I...

514
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,890
I'm sorry.I'm so sorry.

515
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,210
I-I don't mean to intrude,but...

516
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:56,500
you might want to sit with this for a
few days before you make your decision.

517
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:59,380
There's no decision to make.

518
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:00,920
I'm H.I.V.

519
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,140
Positive,and the condom broke.

520
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,810
Oh,I-I got tested already,
and,um,I will again s...

521
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:12,680
in,um,six months,but,uh,so
far I'm fine.

522
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,720
So...

523
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,260
please I just...I-I...

524
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,530
I want to get this over with.

525
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:21,560
Is there any chance that we
can take care of it today?

526
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:22,840
Yeah.

527
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,990
Let me,uh...

528
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,300
let me see what I can set up.

529
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,450
- Here.
- All righT.

530
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,170
- Torres.
- Hey.

531
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:43,440
Uh,do me a... do me a...do me a
favor and,uh,put yang on your surgery.

532
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,030
Only if you buy drinks
at joe's tonight.

533
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,540
Done.

534
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:05,100
dr. Montgomery,will
you do me a favor?

535
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:06,270
Can you talk to my patient?

536
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,880
I don't work here anymore,stevens.

537
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,150
She's pregnant and H.I.V.

538
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:11,330
Positive,and she thinks she
has to terminate the pregnancy.

539
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:12,040
She doesn'T.

540
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:14,840
I know,but she doesn't, and
it's not my area of expertise.

541
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,090
I don't work here anymore,stevens.

542
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,890
If I worked here,I would be performing
surgery after surgery after surgery.

543
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,360
I might even be back with,uh,my
husband,who is apparently on the market,

544
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:28,200
and I'm not saying that I want
to get back with my husband.

545
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,470
It's just that things were
simpler with him than the messy,

546
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:35,410
messy single life I am currently living,
which was not my point,by the way.

547
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,220
My point was...

548
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,530
that I no longer work here,

549
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:42,130
which means you need to pull your
face out of the potato chip trough

550
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,130
and go tend to your
patients yourself.

551
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,050
- I know,but...
- you're a fighter,stevens.

552
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,290
What happened?

553
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,540
I lost a lot of fights.

554
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:50,970
Well,time to get backP.

555
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,110
Go.

556
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,450
Be the change you want
to see in the world.

557
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,880
Did you just quote gandhi to me?

558
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:06,930
It's,uh,time to take her to
the O.R. I'm not an idiot.

559
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:09,250
We heard you.

560
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,700
It could be bad,

561
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:15,500
and there's always a whole lot
of bad to focus on if you want to.

562
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,420
But there's hope,too,right?

563
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:22,110
There's always hope,too.

564
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:27,850
Jennifer?

565
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,690
No,it's dr. Shepherd.

566
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,640
I hate this...

567
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:34,300
not being able to see.

568
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:36,140
I just want to see jennifer.

569
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,370
Phillip,this is an
extremely risky operation.

570
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,690
You still may have
a few weeks to live.

571
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,900
You could spend that
time with jennifer.

572
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:47,910
You don't have to do
this surgery today.

573
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,510
I'm trying to fix jennifer up.

574
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:55,500
I don't want to leave her alone.

575
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:59,340
It's the one thing about all
this I really can't stand.

576
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,840
I just want her to be
all right when I'm gone.

577
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,710
You need to tell her that.

578
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,960
Before you go into surgery,

579
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,990
you need to remember
this conversation,

580
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:14,060
and you need to tell her that.

581
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:22,440
I only have five minutes
because we moved a surgery up.

582
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,600
But I did want tcome here and say that
obviously,he doesn't know me at all.

583
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,680
I'm not the one who's
emotionally involved.

584
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,770
He's the one who's
emotionally involved.

585
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:31,790
He""?"

586
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:34,710
Derek...told me not
to get my hopes up.

587
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:38,610
Anybody who knows me knows I'm
not a hopeful person to begin with.

588
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,340
Right.

589
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,880
I came up with this clinical trial.

590
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:41,990
It's my baby.

591
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:44,240
Does he honestly think
that I've just walked into

592
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,710
this thi with no understanding
of how hard it will be?

593
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:47,740
Seriously.

594
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,230
No wonder we didn't work out.

595
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:51,580
Because he told you not
to get your hopes up.

596
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,670
Exactly.

597
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,450
I gotta go.

598
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:54,820
Surgery's about to start.

599
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,850
The surgery with no hope?

600
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,670
Shut up.

601
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:05,100
so who's the new mystery
woman that derek's dating?

602
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,530
Who's the unlucky mcrebound?

603
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:11,810
what?

604
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,030
Oh,is the... the whole
"mc" thing over now?

605
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,330
I mean,surely things haven't
changed that much around here.

606
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,680
Addison,the woman standing
immediately to your right,

607
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,320
the one handing you the
surgical instruments...

608
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:30,660
Six dates,heavy petting,
lots of tongue...good guy.

609
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,070
Scalpel?

610
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:38,370
we can have the baby?

611
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,300
You're saying we can have
the baby... a healthy baby.

612
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,170
With the proper prenatal treatment,

613
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:46,050
the risks to your baby
are substantially reduced.

614
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,610
I haven't found you an O.B.

615
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:49,410
Yet,and I think the process
might prove really difficult...

616
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:50,270
it doesn't matter.

617
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:50,890
We'll figure it out.

618
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,130
We can figure anything out.

619
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:54,630
Uh,I can't believe this.

620
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,650
- Thank you.
- No.

621
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,190
No.

622
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:59,000
Do not thank her.

623
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:01,240
I asked you to do one thing.

624
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,870
I-I asked you to
schedule an abortion.

625
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,190
- Sarah...
- no.

626
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,250
She just walks in here and gets
your hopes up,and that's not okay.

627
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:13,060
I was diagnosed at 19,and I
have learned how to deal with it.

628
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,960
But I will not put
that onto a baby.

629
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:20,940
I cannot bring a baby into this world
who could possibly have this disease.

630
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,950
I won'T.Now...

631
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:26,730
could you please just
schedule the abortion?

632
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,100
And do me a favor.

633
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,360
Don't come back.

634
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:31,860
I'd like a different doctor.

635
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,320
whats up?

636
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,930
remember what we talked about?

637
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,410
jennifer.

638
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,100
Jenn?

639
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,980
Jennifer!

640
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:08,960
I-I don't want to leave you alone.

641
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:11,060
I-I want you to meet someone.

642
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,080
I want you to
promise me you'll try.

643
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:19,120
'Cause...I can't...I can't do this
thinking I'm leaving you alone.

644
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,540
Okay?

645
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,720
Okay.

646
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,260
Okay.

647
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,170
Maybe I'll make it.

648
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:32,000
I-I hope I'll make it.

649
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,200
just a little bit further.

650
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,620
Good.Keep him flat.

651
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,420
The placenta looks good.

652
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,050
- You okay to close,dr. Bailey?
- Yes.

653
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,280
Membrane's intact.

654
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,050
Oh,no.

655
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,550
She's hemorrhaging.

656
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:23,600
Oh,no.

657
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,470
This blood is coming
a little bit too fast.

658
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,500
hey,I need another
set of hands over here.

659
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,940
*******

660
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,290
Where's montgomery?

661
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:48,480
The mom is in distress.

662
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,500
They're still trying to close.

663
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,450
Okay,get the baby to hahn.

664
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,880
Addie knows what she's doing.

665
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,510
I think I've been
hiding in the clinic.

666
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,470
Yeah?Okay.

667
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,680
- Listen,izzie...
- I lost the contest.

668
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:00,700
I couldn't hack cardio.

669
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,590
I performed C.P.R.On a deer.

670
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,230
Izzie...

671
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,420
I think I've been hiding.

672
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:05,960
I... you can't come play
darts with us tonight.

673
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:06,560
What?

674
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:07,630
I-I shouldn't have to say this.

675
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,490
You should get this.

676
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:09,290
Get what?

677
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,480
You're...you're not
an intern anymore.

678
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,250
And,you know,I'm not a resident.

679
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:16,430
And that sucks,but I'm
trying to make the best of it.

680
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:20,320
I'm trying to,you know,I'm trying to
stop complaining and embrace what I have.

681
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,340
And what I have is new friends
who don't want to get drunk

682
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:24,940
and play darts with their boss.

683
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:25,810
I'm their boss.

684
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,170
Yes.Yeah.

685
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,760
You're their boss.

686
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:31,600
You're in charge,and
you should get that.

687
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:33,920
I gotta do something.

688
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,200
Get in here.

689
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,160
I thought I made myself clear.

690
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,920
You did.Iidn'T.

691
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:45,720
Get in here.

692
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,790
Listen and learn.

693
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:49,670
I knew it.

694
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,920
You disapprove.

695
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,250
You're here to push some
kind of agenda,right?

696
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,620
No.No.

697
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,880
Listen...

698
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:59,020
if you want to have an abortion
because you want to have an abortion,

699
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:01,860
then that's between you and
whatever god you believe in.

700
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,460
But if you want to have an
abortion because you think

701
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,600
that's what medicine
is telling you to do,

702
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:07,450
then that's between you and me.

703
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,800
I was ineffectual.

704
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,700
I was unclear.

705
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:13,260
I've been on my heels
a little bit lately,

706
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:16,690
and I was unclear,so
just listen,okay?

707
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:20,140
I wasn't telling you there is some
chance your baby might not be born sick.

708
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:24,340
I was telling you there
is a 98% chance your baby

709
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,110
could be born perfectly healthy...

710
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:27,880
a 98% chance.

711
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,550
There's a higher chance of your
baby being born with down syndrome

712
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:33,460
than there is of you passing
H.I.V. On to your child.

713
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,710
I don'T...

714
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,560
I just... I-I can't...

715
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:39,360
I know you gave up on having
children a long time ago,

716
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:43,110
and I understand that it's difficult
to readjust your thinking so quickly,

717
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,590
but,sarah,if you take
your meds responsibly,

718
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:50,600
there's no reason why you can't
have a beautiful,healthy baby.

719
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,630
This is your chance...

720
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,930
if you want it.

721
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,590
This is your chance to be a mom.

722
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,870
A 98% chance?

723
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:03,570
A 98% chance.

724
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,540
Thank you.

725
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,400
We are on the clock here,dr. Karev.

726
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:25,500
We need montgomery now.

727
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:26,130
And she's coming.

728
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:26,990
She'll be here.

729
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:29,340
Heart rate's down to the
60s.He's bradychardic.

730
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,450
Damn it.We could lose him.

731
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,040
Tell me what to do.

732
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,010
massage the heart.

733
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,930
gently.

734
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:49,090
I can feel it getting stronger.

735
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:52,500
Heart rate's back up to the 140s.

736
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,600
I pushed 60cc of bolused N.S.****

737
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:56,300
Good job,karev.

738
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,760
You can step back now.

739
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:08,720
And now...

740
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:12,660
all right,the moment of truth.

741
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:16,710
Injecting the virus into the tumor.

742
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:20,640
All right,we're doing this one
stage repair to prevent infection.

743
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,760
Ready for the skin graft.

744
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,580
complete heart block.

745
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,730
The injection went
into the intra-arterial.

746
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,110
Okay,push one of atropine.

747
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,640
Not responding.

748
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:36,550
Push another one.

749
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,770
Oh,come on.

750
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,170
need another set
of hands over here.

751
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,000
okay,there we go.

752
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,730
Okay,it's controlled right?

753
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:46,820
Yeah,it's controlled.

754
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,220
I got it.I got it.Go.

755
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,440
look at that...

756
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:57,200
beating inside his chest
for the very first time.

757
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:00,650
And god admired his
amazing skin flap...

758
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,880
and he saw that it was good.

759
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:03,980
How is he?

760
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:08,600
I was able to reduce the heart almost
all the way into the pericardial space.

761
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,130
no intestines in there,
no diaphragmatic hernia?

762
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,360
no anything.

763
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:13,850
His heart's in.It's beating.

764
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,030
patient number one...
treatment failed.

765
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:29,610
Call it,dr. Grey.

766
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:33,100
Time of death...1933.

767
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,140
The parents were right.

768
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:45,520
The baby... no
further complications.

769
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:48,850
Good,good,and mom's okay,too.

770
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:53,970
You seem sad...

771
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:55,540
miranda.

772
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,840
we're not gonna do this.

773
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:07,720
I can't share.

774
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:09,500
I can't catch up with you.

775
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,240
I can't talk.

776
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:17,380
'Cause if I did,if I
told you tucker moved out,

777
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:23,590
if I told you I haven't
slept alone in 12 years,

778
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:28,890
if I told you that my heart
hurt so much sometimes,

779
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,470
I want to rip it from my chest
with my own little hands...

780
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,430
I would fall apart.

781
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,300
And I don't have
time to fall apart.

782
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:41,670
And not that I'm not
happy to see you...I am...

783
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:45,450
but I wish that you would go home

784
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:52,170
so thehoice to talk and
fall apart would go away.

785
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:18,650
i got my hopes up.

786
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,790
Yeah,me,too.

787
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:22,890
- dr. Shepherd.
- Yes.

788
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:29,210
It was a pleasure
working with you today.

789
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:36,480
dr. Grey.

790
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,620
I do miss some of this.

791
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,960
I could put the
paperwork through tonight.

792
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,100
You could start work tomorrow.

793
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:01,820
I...needed to come back...

794
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:04,850
to see that it was right to leave.

795
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,650
You need to fill my position.

796
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,800
I was gandhi,dr. Montgomery.

797
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:14,850
I was so freakin' gandhi,
I kicked gandhi's ass.

798
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:19,900
it's an L.A.Thing.

799
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,770
Aren't you gonna be
late for your party?

800
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:33,890
I'm gonna blow 'em off.

801
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,920
I'd rather hang
out with you anyway.

802
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,660
George,I get it.

803
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,280
I don't have to
like it,but I get it.

804
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:42,070
So go.

805
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,590
Go "code" or whatever.

806
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:48,680
you know,whenever anyone,uh,
says something really funny,

807
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:51,510
and I'm laughing,I always
look around to see if,

808
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:52,920
uh,you think it's funny,too.

809
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:55,660
Even...even when you're not
there, I still look around.

810
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,570
Go.

811
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:42,590
I bet you wish you'd taken
the stairs right about now.

812
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:48,260
giving birth may be all
intense and magical and stuff,

813
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:49,710
but the act itself?

814
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,930
It's not exactly pleasant.

815
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:54,590
but it's also a beginning...

816
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,340
of something incredible..

817
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,160
I am.I am very,very funny.

818
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,090
You wouldn't believe what she...
you wouldn't believe what she...

819
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:00,850
wait,wait,wait.

820
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:01,610
Hang on,hang on...

821
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,340
that was some really funny...

822
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,150
You've got a hair

823
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,260
that's caught...

824
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:08,920
caught in your lip gloss.

825
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,150
Something new...

826
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:11,520
sorry.

827
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:12,390
You were saying?

828
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:13,890
No,really,I'm just very funny.

829
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:14,580
Funny,hmm?

830
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:15,950
Yes,it turns out I am.

831
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:16,980
- Apparently.
- Yep.

832
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:19,230
Any of you ladies want to dance?

833
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:23,180
For the thousandth
time,the answer is no,mark.

834
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:24,410
- Beat it,sloan.
- I'll dance with you.

835
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,150
Something unpredictable...

836
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,490
dr. Montgomery.

837
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,550
dr. Hahn.

838
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,590
Yang.

839
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:35,920
Yang?

840
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,920
Okay,is it... is
it 'cause I'm asian?

841
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:39,020
Is that your problem?

842
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,350
You don't like asian people?

843
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:41,270
Excuse me?

844
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:42,870
Why won't you teach me?

845
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,060
You're not without skill,
you're not without talent...

846
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,980
so stop seeking my approval.

847
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,870
I am not gonna tell you what
a good little girl you are.

848
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:58,370
It's not my job,and frankly, it
doesn't make you any better at yours.

849
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:06,970
Jeez.

850
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:09,560
Little hard on her,don't you think?

851
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:13,100
I think she reminds me of me.

852
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,660
Something true...

853
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:21,140
she's pretty,huh?

854
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,320
She's betiful.

855
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,400
Something worth loving...

856
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,580
wanna get outta here?

857
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,240
Like you wouldn't believe.

858
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,760
Something worth missing...

859
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:53,270
dr. Stevens,labs for rebecca pope.

860
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:54,800
Thanks very much.

861
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:58,090
No,this...

862
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:58,700
this can't be right.

863
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:00,210
Are you sure this is right?

864
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,850
hey,you leaving already?

865
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,620

aromatherapy candles,I'm very zen...

867
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:19,410
but I...want to kick your ass so
badly right now,it is killing me.

868
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:20,440
Excuse me?

869
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:22,320
I'm talking about derek...

870
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:26,190

871
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,090
Are you letting him get away?

872
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:30,680
