176
00:09:10,996 --> 00:09:13,692
O'Malley, George. Look,
it's just a simple blood test.

177
00:09:13,765 --> 00:09:15,232
Here you go.

178
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,528
Thank you.

179
00:09:18,403 --> 00:09:20,268
[Sighing]

180
00:09:23,108 --> 00:09:25,201
Franklin, Jordan.
I need these back ASAP.

181
00:09:25,277 --> 00:09:27,006
What a shocker.

182
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:29,070
Hey, what did you get,
something good?

183
00:09:29,147 --> 00:09:31,707
Syphilis? That's not surgical.
Who has syphilis?

184
00:09:34,319 --> 00:09:36,378
Excuse us. Sorry.

185
00:09:38,357 --> 00:09:40,450
- You have syphilis?
- Shh!

186
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:50,601
- I don't know how this happened.
- Of course you do.

187
00:09:50,669 --> 00:09:52,569
Olivia must really be getting around.

188
00:09:52,638 --> 00:09:53,866
She's not like that.

189
00:09:53,939 --> 00:09:55,634
It's a new millennium, George.

190
00:09:55,707 --> 00:09:59,165
The only people who aren't like that
are the Amish and, apparently, you.

191
00:09:59,244 --> 00:10:02,077
You don't know.
Maybe I've been sleeping around.

192
00:10:02,147 --> 00:10:03,705
Maybe I got ladies.

193
00:10:05,117 --> 00:10:06,243
Shut up.

194
00:10:06,318 --> 00:10:08,809
- What am I gonna do?
- It's no biggie.

195
00:10:08,887 --> 00:10:11,913
- Penicillin'll knock it out.
- What am I gonna do about Olivia?

196
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,855
For starters,
stop sleeping with her,

197
00:10:13,926 --> 00:10:15,826
unless you want that thing to fall off.

198
00:10:15,894 --> 00:10:18,886
[George] OK, that is twice
that you have trash-talked

199
00:10:18,964 --> 00:10:21,262
the girl that I could
one day potentially...

200
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,824
Well, not love,
but like a whole lot.

201
00:10:23,902 --> 00:10:25,893
If she gave it to you,
you have to tell her.

202
00:10:25,971 --> 00:10:27,233
Three.

203
00:10:27,306 --> 00:10:29,206
Fine.
She didn't give it to you.

204
00:10:29,274 --> 00:10:31,105
She was a virgin when you met.

205
00:10:31,176 --> 00:10:33,906
You still have to tell her
so she can get tested.

206
00:10:33,979 --> 00:10:35,241
Oh, yeah?

207
00:10:35,314 --> 00:10:37,475
How am I gonna tell her?

208
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:39,483
"Uh, hey, Olivia. How you doing?

209
00:10:39,551 --> 00:10:42,042
By the way, I got the syph.
How about you?"

210
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,417
Maybe not quite like that.

211
00:10:43,488 --> 00:10:45,513
No, it's good advice,
really good advice.

212
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:46,579
Thank you very much.

213
00:10:46,658 --> 00:10:48,649
[Richard] Retract here.

214
00:10:49,795 --> 00:10:51,695
Oh! This just isn't holding.

215
00:10:51,763 --> 00:10:54,061
Give me a bigger retractor, please.

216
00:10:54,132 --> 00:10:56,692
[Woman] Sorry, doctor.

217
00:10:56,768 --> 00:10:58,292
[Richard] It wasn't you.

218
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:00,895
[Clearing throat]

219
00:11:00,973 --> 00:11:03,032
Dr. Bailey,
you can finish this.

220
00:11:03,108 --> 00:11:07,135
Uh, thank you, chief.
I appreciate the opportunity.

221
00:11:07,212 --> 00:11:08,406
I'll just...

222
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:22,456
[Alex] I gotta say, George,

223
00:11:22,527 --> 00:11:24,620
I didn't think you had it in you.

224
00:11:24,696 --> 00:11:26,493
It's always the quiet ones.

225
00:11:26,565 --> 00:11:28,760
- So who's the woman?
- None of your business.

226
00:11:28,834 --> 00:11:30,028
Oh, come on.

227
00:11:30,102 --> 00:11:32,229
Who gave you the cooties
on the playground?

228
00:11:32,304 --> 00:11:34,864
You must have had something
like this before, right?

229
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,636
I never talk about my penis
with other men.

230
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:43,138
I don't n... either, normally.

231
00:11:47,119 --> 00:11:48,552
We better get Burke.

232
00:11:53,392 --> 00:11:54,859
[Knocking on door]

233
00:11:54,926 --> 00:11:57,622
Mr. Franklin?

234
00:11:57,696 --> 00:12:00,221
You have a condition
known as ascites.

235
00:12:00,298 --> 00:12:01,993
Oh, my God.
I knew it was terrible.

236
00:12:02,067 --> 00:12:04,797
It just means there's fluid
in the peritoneal cavity.

237
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,269
The abdomen.

238
00:12:06,338 --> 00:12:08,533
The swelling is pressing
against your lungs,

239
00:12:08,607 --> 00:12:10,871
which is why you're having
trouble breathing.

240
00:12:10,942 --> 00:12:12,910
It looks like
a symptom of liver disease.

241
00:12:12,978 --> 00:12:15,469
And it all comes together.

242
00:12:15,547 --> 00:12:17,640
Alice, not now.

243
00:12:17,716 --> 00:12:20,685
Is there something we should know?

244
00:12:22,187 --> 00:12:23,882
I drink a bit.

245
00:12:23,955 --> 00:12:26,355
That's the understatement of the year.

246
00:12:26,425 --> 00:12:28,620
- That's enough out of you.
- Hey!

247
00:12:28,693 --> 00:12:29,990
I'm only here for Mom,

248
00:12:30,062 --> 00:12:32,428
to make sure you don't pull
any of your usual crap.

249
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,192
There's definitely a growth
protruding into the bladder,

250
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,897
but look at the edges.

251
00:12:39,971 --> 00:12:43,134
- I don't think it's a tumor.
- Kind of shaped like an ovary.

252
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,540
That the answer you're
gonna give your patient?

253
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,578
This's one of my oldest friends.

254
00:12:47,646 --> 00:12:50,206
- You might want to take this seriously.
- I'm sorry.

255
00:12:50,282 --> 00:12:51,909
You better be.

256
00:12:51,983 --> 00:12:54,042
I got the rest of the labs back.

257
00:12:54,119 --> 00:12:56,849
They did a chromosome analysis
of the tissue.

258
00:12:56,922 --> 00:12:59,447
You won't believe this.

259
00:13:04,062 --> 00:13:06,053
Bill has an ovary?

260
00:13:14,106 --> 00:13:17,564
Um, according to his daughter,
Mr. Franklin is a heavy drinker.

261
00:13:17,642 --> 00:13:20,304
Six to eight drinks a day,
an alcoholic by any standard.

262
00:13:20,378 --> 00:13:22,312
- Protocol?
- Schedule a paracentesis.

263
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,369
Reason?

264
00:13:23,448 --> 00:13:25,473
Draining the fluid'll relieve pressure.

265
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,245
Good, but don't schedule it. Do it.

266
00:13:27,319 --> 00:13:29,549
You want us to do the procedure?

267
00:13:29,621 --> 00:13:31,987
- You've seen one, right?
- Absolutely.

268
00:13:32,057 --> 00:13:33,581
Well, now do one.

269
00:13:35,494 --> 00:13:37,359
I've never seen one.

270
00:13:37,429 --> 00:13:38,953
You're about to.

271
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,258
Oh, my God.

272
00:13:40,332 --> 00:13:42,391
God, an ovary.

273
00:13:42,467 --> 00:13:45,163
It gives new meaning
to the term "metrosexual."

274
00:13:46,805 --> 00:13:48,272
- Hi, George.
- Olivia.

275
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,898
What am I, invisible?

276
00:13:49,975 --> 00:13:51,408
Alex.

277
00:13:51,476 --> 00:13:54,036
You go ahead.
I'll catch up with you later.

278
00:14:03,188 --> 00:14:05,281
About time
I got you alone today.

279
00:14:09,995 --> 00:14:12,054
- Olivia...
- What time is your shift done?

280
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,620
Because mine's over at 8,

281
00:14:13,698 --> 00:14:15,723
and I thought maybe
you could come over.

282
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,199
I need to tell you something.

283
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:20,796
What's wrong?
Are you breaking up with me?

284
00:14:20,872 --> 00:14:24,035
What? No.
Oh, no. Really, no.

285
00:14:24,109 --> 00:14:26,600
It's just...

286
00:14:26,912 --> 00:14:31,406
OK, you're the only person
that I've been with in a long time.

287
00:14:31,483 --> 00:14:34,680
I mean, not unusually long
or anything, you know?

288
00:14:34,753 --> 00:14:37,085
Just a normal amount of long time.

289
00:14:37,155 --> 00:14:40,613
But it wouldn't matter to me if
you've been with someone else.

290
00:14:40,692 --> 00:14:41,989
Maybe you have?

291
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:46,019
I'm not accusing you of anything
or, you know, judging you

292
00:14:46,097 --> 00:14:49,999
or handing out scarlet letters
or anything, you know?

293
00:14:50,068 --> 00:14:51,933
You're a woman, you know?

294
00:14:52,003 --> 00:14:53,368
A very attractive woman.

295
00:14:53,438 --> 00:14:55,633
Of course you've been
with other men.

296
00:14:55,707 --> 00:14:58,870
Not that you've been with a lot of men,
like you're a prostitute...

297
00:14:58,944 --> 00:15:01,174
- A prostitute?
- No! Not a...

298
00:15:01,246 --> 00:15:03,407
Not a prostitute. Wha?

299
00:15:03,481 --> 00:15:06,712
No, the opposite
of a prostitute, a lady.

300
00:15:06,785 --> 00:15:08,116
You're very ladylike.

301
00:15:08,186 --> 00:15:10,381
I mean, you're very bendy, but...

302
00:15:10,455 --> 00:15:13,356
- George, breathe.
- OK.

303
00:15:13,425 --> 00:15:16,121
It's just...
OK, here's the thing.

304
00:15:16,194 --> 00:15:18,287
I really like you, Olivia.

305
00:15:18,363 --> 00:15:20,024
I like you a lot.

306
00:15:20,098 --> 00:15:22,191
Well, I like you too.

307
00:15:26,071 --> 00:15:27,698
I have syphilis.

308
00:15:44,155 --> 00:15:47,181
That could have gone better.

309
00:15:53,865 --> 00:15:55,162
[Knocking on door]

310
00:16:02,741 --> 00:16:04,834
You dropped a retractor.

311
00:16:04,909 --> 00:16:06,069
Fine.

312
00:16:07,345 --> 00:16:09,540
A few weeks ago, I was operating,

313
00:16:09,614 --> 00:16:12,105
and the vision in
my right eye became blurry.

314
00:16:12,183 --> 00:16:14,879
After a few hours, it was fine.
It's come back again.

315
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:17,820
- Did you have it checked out?
- The examination was normal.

316
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:21,120
My ophthalmologist tells me
I'm just getting older.

317
00:16:21,192 --> 00:16:24,559
But you know what a decline
in my visual acuity can mean.

318
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:26,290
I'll set up some tests.

319
00:16:26,364 --> 00:16:28,696
Shep,

320
00:16:28,767 --> 00:16:31,565
I know how the rumor mill
runs around here.

321
00:16:31,636 --> 00:16:33,797
Let's just keep this to ourselves.

322
00:16:33,872 --> 00:16:35,806
Absolutely.

323
00:16:35,874 --> 00:16:38,035
Yeah.

324
00:16:42,981 --> 00:16:45,176
[George] Do you think
she's talking about me?

325
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,047
She's absolutely talking about you.

326
00:16:47,118 --> 00:16:49,313
[Alex] Dude, that's a good thing.

327
00:16:49,387 --> 00:16:50,786
[George] No. No, it's not.

328
00:16:50,855 --> 00:16:52,117
Georgie, get a clue.

329
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:55,091
Syphilis is the best thing
that ever happened to you.

330
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,094
In their eyes, you're a player.

331
00:17:00,398 --> 00:17:01,763
[Cristina] Hey, syph-boy.

332
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:02,891
You told her?

333
00:17:02,967 --> 00:17:04,025
Just Cristina.

334
00:17:04,102 --> 00:17:05,399
[Alex] "Syph-boy."

335
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,903
It's got a nice ring to it,

336
00:17:06,971 --> 00:17:08,836
kind of like Superboy,
only diseased.

337
00:17:08,907 --> 00:17:11,637
[Cristina] Izzie didn't say a word.
Here, the only thing

338
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:13,871
that spreads faster
than disease is gossip.

339
00:17:13,945 --> 00:17:16,846
That's not true. Just 'cause Izzie
can't keep her mouth shut

340
00:17:16,915 --> 00:17:18,576
doesn't mean everyone knows.

341
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,982
How are you feeling?
Sorry about the syphilis.

342
00:17:21,052 --> 00:17:23,816
Everyone in this hospital knows?

343
00:17:25,156 --> 00:17:27,590
Knows you're a player.

344
00:17:27,659 --> 00:17:29,627
- You're disturbed.
- True.

345
00:17:29,694 --> 00:17:32,754
Everybody's got a secret.
Be glad yours is out in the open.

346
00:17:32,831 --> 00:17:34,526
Oh, yeah, Alex?
What's yours?

347
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:36,567
You show me yours,
and I'll show you mine.

348
00:17:39,771 --> 00:17:44,105
I bet you've got some seriously
kinky skeletons in your closet.

349
00:17:44,175 --> 00:17:46,735
What's in my closet
is none of your business.

350
00:17:46,811 --> 00:17:49,644
Well, I don't have any secrets.
My life is boring.

351
00:17:49,714 --> 00:17:52,182
Everybody's got something to hide.

352
00:18:00,658 --> 00:18:02,592
Well, the mass we found
is not a tumor.

353
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,025
Well, that's good, right?

354
00:18:04,095 --> 00:18:06,063
Anything's got to be
better than cancer.

355
00:18:06,131 --> 00:18:08,122
That's where it gets a little tricky.

356
00:18:08,199 --> 00:18:10,099
The chromosomal tests have revealed

357
00:18:10,168 --> 00:18:12,966
that your body contains DNA
from two different embryos

358
00:18:13,037 --> 00:18:16,302
that merged in the womb at the
very beginning of development.

359
00:18:16,374 --> 00:18:18,239
In rare cases such as yours,

360
00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:21,107
the condition can produce
gonadal hermaphroditism.

361
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:23,374
I'm hearing scary words
here, Preston,

362
00:18:23,448 --> 00:18:25,416
you know, pay-cable kind of words.

363
00:18:25,483 --> 00:18:28,748
In English, the mass
in your bladder is an ovary.

364
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,048
Huh?

365
00:18:30,121 --> 00:18:32,351
Don't worry.
We're gonna remove it.

366
00:18:32,424 --> 00:18:35,757
We have an excellent
gynecological surgeon on staff.

367
00:18:35,827 --> 00:18:39,024
You're telling me
I'm a guy with an ovary?

368
00:18:39,097 --> 00:18:42,066
It's simply a quirk of nature, man.

369
00:18:44,402 --> 00:18:46,529
[Exhaling]

370
00:18:46,604 --> 00:18:49,232
What am I gonna tell Holly?

371
00:18:49,307 --> 00:18:51,366
That you're gonna be fine.

372
00:18:51,443 --> 00:18:53,070
I'm still a man, right?

373
00:18:53,144 --> 00:18:55,578
A man's man, a Kappa man.

374
00:18:55,647 --> 00:18:59,105
I mean...
you know, my sex life.

375
00:18:59,184 --> 00:19:01,175
You been having any problems?

376
00:19:01,252 --> 00:19:04,585
[Laughs] Was it my very pregnant wife
that gave it away?

377
00:19:04,656 --> 00:19:06,214
[Both laughing]

378
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:09,749
Come on, man, don't worry.
You never knew it was there.

379
00:19:09,828 --> 00:19:12,092
You won't miss it when it's gone.

380
00:19:14,265 --> 00:19:16,426
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

381
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:18,366
It's a shot of penicillin, George.

382
00:19:18,436 --> 00:19:20,233
Be grateful I'm even doing this.

383
00:19:20,305 --> 00:19:22,239
I've seen more of you
than I ever wanted.

384
00:19:22,307 --> 00:19:24,241
I'll be fighting nightmares for a week.

385
00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:25,469
Know what? Forget this.

386
00:19:25,543 --> 00:19:27,408
Do you want to get rid
of the syph or not?

387
00:19:27,479 --> 00:19:28,912
Just shut up and drop 'em.

388
00:19:31,316 --> 00:19:32,977
I cannot believe this.

389
00:19:33,051 --> 00:19:35,349
Meredith, go away!

390
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:38,480
Oh, George. Thought you
could use some moral support.

391
00:19:38,556 --> 00:19:40,387
No.
No moral support.

392
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:41,982
I'm indisposed here.

393
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,460
George, it's not a big deal.

394
00:19:44,529 --> 00:19:46,554
And you have a cute butt.

395
00:19:46,631 --> 00:19:49,532
[Alex] I have a cute butt too.
You want to see?

396
00:19:49,601 --> 00:19:51,831
Oh, get out.
You're doing it wrong.

397
00:19:51,903 --> 00:19:53,837
- Be my guest.
- What? Alex.

398
00:19:53,905 --> 00:19:55,429
Alex.

399
00:19:55,507 --> 00:19:56,633
Wha?

400
00:19:58,476 --> 00:19:59,738
Hey!

401
00:19:59,811 --> 00:20:01,711
[Izzie] What are we doing here?

402
00:20:01,779 --> 00:20:03,337
Breaking George's spirit.

403
00:20:03,414 --> 00:20:06,542
- Curing George's syph.
- I don't like needles.

404
00:20:06,618 --> 00:20:08,779
[Meredith] Good thing
you became a doctor.

405
00:20:08,853 --> 00:20:09,979
Other side.

406
00:20:10,054 --> 00:20:11,453
- [Cristina] Izzie?
- Yeah?

407
00:20:11,523 --> 00:20:14,651
Mr. Franklin's procedure's been
scheduled for after lunch...

408
00:20:14,726 --> 00:20:16,318
Oh, what are we doing?

409
00:20:16,394 --> 00:20:20,160
We're saving George from a future
of festering sores and insanity.

410
00:20:20,231 --> 00:20:21,892
- Oh, cute butt.
- Told you.

411
00:20:21,966 --> 00:20:23,866
It is cute, like a baby's.

412
00:20:27,372 --> 00:20:29,636
You know, I have spent
hours, days, years,

413
00:20:29,707 --> 00:20:34,440
imagining myself half-naked
in a room with three women.

414
00:20:35,747 --> 00:20:37,942
The reality is so much better.

415
00:20:38,016 --> 00:20:39,984
I think he's gonna cry.

416
00:20:40,051 --> 00:20:41,177
[All laughing]

417
00:20:41,252 --> 00:20:43,982
<i>Hi. It's Ms. Henry again.</i>

418
00:20:44,055 --> 00:20:46,546
<i>- Is this a better time?
- Sorry about this morning.</i>

419
00:20:46,624 --> 00:20:49,320
I wasn't alone and...
What were you calling about?

420
00:20:49,394 --> 00:20:51,021
<i>I just wanted to remind you</i>

421
00:20:51,095 --> 00:20:53,222
that tonight's our
monthly family dinner.

422
00:20:53,298 --> 00:20:56,199
You know, you haven't been
to any of our family functions.

423
00:20:56,267 --> 00:20:57,894
You have to understand.

424
00:20:57,969 --> 00:21:01,302
I'm a surgical intern,
so my time isn't my own.

425
00:21:01,372 --> 00:21:03,840
Our residents really respond
to these events.

426
00:21:03,908 --> 00:21:06,399
They always enjoy themselves,
which is so rare.

427
00:21:06,477 --> 00:21:09,446
<i>I think it's important you attend.</i>

428
00:21:09,514 --> 00:21:11,141
I'll be there.

429
00:21:11,215 --> 00:21:15,117
I'll try to be there.
I'll definitely try.

430
00:21:15,186 --> 00:21:17,211
I've cleared some time
for your MRI.

431
00:21:17,288 --> 00:21:18,619
Good.
Let's get going.

432
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:19,714
OK.

433
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:22,817
Uh, sorry to bother you
with this, chief.

434
00:21:22,894 --> 00:21:25,192
We've got kind of a situation.

435
00:21:25,263 --> 00:21:26,890
What now?

436
00:21:26,965 --> 00:21:29,661
Three interns, four residents

437
00:21:29,734 --> 00:21:32,498
and six nurses on this surgical floor

438
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:36,006
have been diagnosed with... syphilis.

439
00:21:36,074 --> 00:21:40,670
[Woman] There are over
70,000 new cases every year.

440
00:21:40,745 --> 00:21:45,341
Undiagnosed, syphilis can lead to
blindness, insanity and death.

441
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:48,112
If you are having unprotected sex

442
00:21:48,186 --> 00:21:51,781
with another member
of the staff, get tested.

443
00:21:51,856 --> 00:21:54,586
This is not a request.

444
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:56,593
[All laughing]

445
00:21:56,661 --> 00:21:58,458
[Sighing]

446
00:21:58,529 --> 00:22:02,556
Patricia will now give you
a safe-sex demonstration.

447
00:22:02,634 --> 00:22:04,898
[Laughing continues]

448
00:22:04,969 --> 00:22:06,630
When the time is right,

449
00:22:06,704 --> 00:22:09,639
and, gentlemen, you'll all
know when that time is,

450
00:22:09,707 --> 00:22:13,643
carefully open the condom packet

451
00:22:13,711 --> 00:22:15,941
and roll it onto the banana.

452
00:22:16,014 --> 00:22:18,448
We should try and get down
to do the MRI now.

453
00:22:18,516 --> 00:22:20,177
This isn't really a good time.

454
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:22,845
If you want to do this
without anybody else knowing,

455
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,182
you should do it now.

456
00:22:24,255 --> 00:22:28,021
[Patricia] Open communication
is essential to a healthy relationship.

457
00:22:28,092 --> 00:22:30,117
In a responsible relationship...

458
00:22:30,194 --> 00:22:32,822
- [Meredith] Poor George.
- [Cristina] Yeah.

459
00:22:32,897 --> 00:22:35,695
You know, I think he
really likes Typhoid Mary.

460
00:22:35,767 --> 00:22:38,031
Well, not many
budding relationships

461
00:22:38,102 --> 00:22:40,297
survive a good dose of VD.

462
00:22:40,371 --> 00:22:42,601
Yeah.

463
00:22:42,674 --> 00:22:44,835
[Patricia] When the banana
is finished...

464
00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:46,501
Yeah.

465
00:22:46,577 --> 00:22:50,445
...gently peel off the condom
and dispose of it properly.

466
00:22:50,515 --> 00:22:54,508
With every fresh banana,
always use a fresh condom.

467
00:22:54,585 --> 00:22:55,847
[Laughter]

468
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,115
<i>[- Nellie McKay : The Dog Song]</i>

469
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,292
[Elevator dings]

470
00:23:23,314 --> 00:23:24,941
[Sighing]

471
00:23:25,016 --> 00:23:27,746
You're avoiding me.

472
00:23:27,819 --> 00:23:31,152
I'm busy, at work.
L-I'm working.

473
00:23:32,423 --> 00:23:34,789
Why are you in this line?

474
00:23:34,859 --> 00:23:36,827
It's the syphilis line.

475
00:23:36,894 --> 00:23:38,885
You don't need to be in this line.

476
00:23:38,963 --> 00:23:41,056
I don't?

477
00:23:41,132 --> 00:23:42,963
There's no one else.

478
00:23:44,902 --> 00:23:47,598
That surprises you?

479
00:23:47,672 --> 00:23:49,572
Nothing surprises me.

480
00:23:51,709 --> 00:23:53,870
Do I need to be in this line?

481
00:23:55,813 --> 00:23:57,110
No.

482
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,409
- OK.
- OK.

483
00:24:01,486 --> 00:24:03,113
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

484
00:24:03,187 --> 00:24:05,553
- Mr. Franklin is prepped and ready.
- Excellent.

485
00:24:05,623 --> 00:24:06,783
God, look at this line.

486
00:24:06,858 --> 00:24:09,019
Well, at least we don't
have to stand in line.

487
00:24:09,093 --> 00:24:11,027
That's the one good thing
about the fact

488
00:24:11,095 --> 00:24:13,290
- neither of us is getting any, right?
- Yeah.

489
00:24:14,465 --> 00:24:17,457
Mr. Franklin, we've given you
a local anesthetic,

490
00:24:17,535 --> 00:24:19,696
but you might feel some pressure.

491
00:24:23,574 --> 00:24:26,407
OK. I'm ready.

492
00:24:26,477 --> 00:24:29,310
- Grab the skin.
- OK.

493
00:24:32,483 --> 00:24:34,747
I'm in the peritoneal cavity.

494
00:24:39,624 --> 00:24:42,184
That fluid is bloody.
Is it supposed to be bloody?

495
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,057
You've done this before, right?

496
00:24:44,128 --> 00:24:46,028
Of course.
Millions of times.

497
00:24:46,097 --> 00:24:48,156
You're doing great, Mr. Franklin.

498
00:24:50,001 --> 00:24:51,366
OK. Wait, wait.

499
00:24:53,337 --> 00:24:54,668
OK, go.

500
00:25:00,211 --> 00:25:01,303
[Cristina] Good.

501
00:25:01,379 --> 00:25:03,040
[Sighing]

502
00:25:03,114 --> 00:25:06,242
Now all we have to do is wait.

503
00:25:08,486 --> 00:25:11,080
- You see that right there?
- Mm-hmm.

504
00:25:11,155 --> 00:25:14,591
It's a tumor, and it's
pressing against your optic nerve.

505
00:25:14,659 --> 00:25:15,990
Is it operable?

506
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,357
Oh, definitely.

507
00:25:17,428 --> 00:25:20,329
It does have its risks.

508
00:25:20,398 --> 00:25:22,730
You mean I could lose my sight?

509
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,792
Just what I need, a syphilis
outbreak and a tumor.

510
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:27,269
It's probably unrelated.

511
00:25:29,207 --> 00:25:32,267
All right, Derek, let's see
how good you really are.

512
00:25:32,343 --> 00:25:34,811
All right. I'll put a team together.

513
00:25:34,879 --> 00:25:36,005
All my people only.

514
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,275
And I still want this
kept under wraps.

515
00:25:38,349 --> 00:25:40,647
The vultures will be
circling soon enough.

516
00:25:40,718 --> 00:25:42,117
Aren't I one of the vultures?

517
00:25:42,186 --> 00:25:44,313
Why do you think I want
to keep an eye on you?

518
00:25:44,388 --> 00:25:46,720
Get going.
We're doing this tonight.

519
00:25:46,791 --> 00:25:47,917
Right.

520
00:25:50,428 --> 00:25:52,692
[Clearing throat]

521
00:25:52,763 --> 00:25:54,390
[Meredith] You paged.

522
00:25:54,465 --> 00:25:57,263
Yeah, I need you to help me out
on something for the chief.

523
00:25:57,335 --> 00:26:01,135
- Can you keep a secret?
- Better than you think.

524
00:26:01,205 --> 00:26:04,697
How much fluid can one body hold?

525
00:26:04,775 --> 00:26:06,072
Shh!

526
00:26:06,143 --> 00:26:09,306
There's a lot of fluid
in there, Mr. Franklin,

527
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,143
but we're almost finished.

528
00:26:11,215 --> 00:26:15,447
[Sighing] Mr. Franklin,
are you sleeping?

529
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:17,714
Mr. Franklin?

530
00:26:17,788 --> 00:26:19,380
- He has no pulse.
- What?

531
00:26:19,457 --> 00:26:20,788
[Izzie] He has no pulse!

533
00:26:37,275 --> 00:26:39,334
How could he die like that
with no warning?

534
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:41,207
There was blood when it first went in.

535
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,873
What if it's our fault?
What if we did something wrong?

536
00:26:43,948 --> 00:26:46,746
We didn't do anything wrong.
We did a textbook procedure.

537
00:26:46,817 --> 00:26:48,444
[Clearing throat]

538
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:51,249
I checked your chart.
You did everything by the book.

539
00:26:51,322 --> 00:26:53,882
He died on our watch.
We must have missed something.

540
00:26:53,958 --> 00:26:55,983
There was no history
of heart problems.

541
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,721
His death wasn't your fault.

542
00:26:57,795 --> 00:26:58,921
When's the autopsy?

543
00:26:58,996 --> 00:27:00,623
There isn't gonna be an autopsy.

544
00:27:00,698 --> 00:27:03,189
What? How are we supposed
to know the cause of death?

545
00:27:03,267 --> 00:27:05,565
It's going down
as cardiopulmonary arrest

546

547
00:27:07,471 --> 00:27:09,166
But an autopsy would...

548
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,232
The family decided
they didn't want an autopsy.

549
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:14,710
- But, Dr. Bailey...
- They don't want an autopsy.

550
00:27:14,779 --> 00:27:16,110

Uh, tell the chief I'll be there.

00:27:36,067 --> 00:27:38,035
Just let me know
when and where. I'm in.

- It's a complicated surgery.

I end a fellow surgeon's career,
my mentor's career.

562
00:27:50,081 --> 00:27:51,605
Oh, no, I'm not nervous.

563
00:27:53,317 --> 00:27:55,046
- So just for the record...
- Mm-hm.

564
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:57,815
...you'd tell me if I need
to get tested, right?

565
00:27:57,888 --> 00:28:00,448
- You think I have syphilis?
- No, I don't.

566
00:28:00,524 --> 00:28:03,288
It's just... We never made
any rules or anything.

567
00:28:03,361 --> 00:28:05,761
I mean, we never said,
"We have rules,"

568
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,991
and I wouldn't hold it against you.

569
00:28:08,065 --> 00:28:10,533
When would I have time
to go out and get syphilis?

570
00:28:10,601 --> 00:28:12,330
You're a handful enough as it is,

You see?
There's nothing to worry about.

574
00:28:19,377 --> 00:28:22,346
Maybe we should, you know,
make some rules, I mean.

575
00:28:22,413 --> 00:28:23,778
We should.

00:28:23,848 --> 00:28:26,578

- Bill should know his wife's cheating.

for certain what killed him?

- You sure?

- Good.

'Cause you're a bad liar!

696
00:34:18,402 --> 00:34:20,097

We've wanted a child for a long time.

704

Why do you want to
take this away from him?

Does he know
you've been cheating on him?

706
00:34:47,998 --> 00:34:49,329
This is between Bill and me.

707
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,836
The man has a right to know
that this isn't his child.

708

Please, just let this go.
Why can't you let this go?

709

Bill is my best friend. That's why.

710
00:34:58,041 --> 00:35:00,202
If you were his friend,
you wouldn't do this.

711
00:35:00,277 --> 00:35:01,710
Please! Tell him the truth!

712
00:35:01,779 --> 00:35:05,510
Why? I'm not gonna ruin my life,
because you think this is wrong.

713

What about his life?

714
00:35:07,618 --> 00:35:09,483
What about this child's life?

715
00:35:09,553 --> 00:35:12,044
What Bill doesn't know won't hurt him.

716
00:35:14,925 --> 00:35:17,189
Fine.

717
00:35:17,261 --> 00:35:20,355
Maybe his friend
wouldn't tell him the truth.

718
00:35:20,431 --> 00:35:22,058
But I'm also his doctor,

719
00:35:22,132 --> 00:35:25,101
and his doctor is not
going to lie to him.

720
00:35:30,541 --> 00:35:32,600
[Meredith] I know,
but something came up,

721
00:35:32,676 --> 00:35:34,541
an important surgery,
and I couldn't.

722
00:35:34,611 --> 00:35:36,772
Sorry you couldn't
be there for your mother.

723

Ms. Henry, if my mother were lucid,
she would understand.

00:35:40,584 --> 00:35:43,883
She's a surgeon.
She's done this countless times.

And besides, she doesn't even
know who I am, anyway, so...

gets off from work.

She isn't traveling.

736

She isn't writing a book.

She isn't anything.

738
00:36:22,459 --> 00:36:24,723

Why?

740
00:36:27,064 --> 00:36:29,931
She has Alzheimer's.

741
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,991
How advanced?

742
00:36:32,069 --> 00:36:33,058
[Meredith] Very.

743
00:36:33,136 --> 00:36:34,330
She's in a home,

744
00:36:34,404 --> 00:36:37,771
and I'm the only one
who even knows she's sick.

745

It's over 600 grams,

and there's some kind of
grainy material in it.

764

- We want to run some tests.
- Oh, now you want to run tests?

You're an intern.

781
00:38:46,036 --> 00:38:47,367
We know what killed him.

782
00:38:47,437 --> 00:38:49,371
[Cristina] He had a blood condition

783
00:38:49,439 --> 00:38:50,963
known as hemachromatosis.

784
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:53,339
The disease causes
an excess amount of iron

785
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:54,672
to build up in the body,

786
00:38:54,745 --> 00:38:56,940
and that's what caused
the heart failure,

787
00:38:57,014 --> 00:38:58,743
not the paracentesis.

788
00:38:58,815 --> 00:39:02,444
But I thought he was always
so sick 'cause of the drinking.

789
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:04,316
And you never let him forget it.

790
00:39:04,388 --> 00:39:05,719
- Or me.
- Mom...

791
00:39:05,789 --> 00:39:08,781
There's something else.
The disease is genetic.

792
00:39:08,859 --> 00:39:11,657
- You think Alice could have it?
- A blood test will tell us.

793
00:39:11,728 --> 00:39:14,026
If you have it,
we'll have caught it to treat it,

794
00:39:14,097 --> 00:39:16,463
