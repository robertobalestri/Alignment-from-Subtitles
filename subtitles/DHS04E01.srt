00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,500
<i>(Ben)</i>
Oh, come on!
We're gonna be late!

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,400
Episode four
never comes to the big screen.

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,000
This is
the pre-lucas-ized version,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,600
<i>remember?</i>

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,100
<i>None of that greedo</i>
shooting first crap.

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,100
Go without me.

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,300
<i>What are you talking about?</i>
You love star wars.

8
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,000
Don't you?

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,400
Ben.

10
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,100
<i>Since when?</i>

11
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,400
Since just before i started
pretending i loved it.

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,200
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,300
I was just
trying to be supportive.

14
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,900
Fine.
I'll go alone.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,200
<i>Baby, i'm sorry.</i>
Me too.

16
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,200
I'm so woozy
i can hardly think.

17
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,300
We'll hang out at home.

18
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,500
No, you should go.

19
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,000
Did you
just feel something?

20
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,100
Feel?

21
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,200
<i>Like what?</i>

22
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,300
Is there an earthquake?

23
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,300
<i>In new jersey?</i>

24
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,400
<i>Oh, god.</i>
What?

25
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,400
I think i'm, like,
hallucinating.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Call 911.

27
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,400
<i>26-year-old female,</i>

28
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,100
xxx

29
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,300
she was pulled
out of the rubble

30
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,300
after six hours.

31
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,500
Two surgeries for
multiple fractures and burns.

32
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,800
I'm thinking the broken bones
are a response

33
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,100
to the building
falling on her head.

34
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,700
And the fever?

35
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,700
<i>She's the only</i>
collapse victim

36
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,700
whose body temperature...

37
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,700
put her on antipyrectics.

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,600
I can't take the case.
I don't have a team.

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,200
So hire a team.

40
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,800
What for?
I don't have a case.

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,900
Have you even
interviewed anybody?

42
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,800
You test drive a car
before you buy it.

43
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,200
You have sex
before you get married,

44
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,500
i can't hire a team
based on a ten-minute interview.

45
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,700
What if i don't like
having sex with them?

46
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,100
You've spent
the last two weeks

47
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,600
doing absolutely nothing.

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,300
Concert is over.

49
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,300
In what twisted universe

50
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,000
does mastering
eddie van halen's

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,800
two-handed arpeggio
technique

52
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,400
count as absolutely nothing?

53
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,300
Take the case
or you will spend the next month

54
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,100
helping the collapse team
change bandages.

55
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,400
I diagnose her.
Alone.

56
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,900
By the end of the day,
you go away for a week.

57
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:04,800
Done.

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,900
It's not gonna work.

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,100
If he solves the case,
we cure the girl.

60
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,500
And prove
he doesn't need a team.

61
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,900
He's not
gonna solve the case.

62
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,000
Not that fast.
Why not.

63
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,700
Because he needs a team!
And this'll prove to him...

64
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,800
you wanna change his mind
about something,

65
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,300
you need
a more convincing argument

66
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,100
than "you promised."

67
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,600
Fever.

68
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,600
Non-responsive to antibiotics
and antipyretics.

69
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,300
Fluctuating consciousness.

70
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:36,900
Go!

71
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,600
<i>(leon)</i>
You talking to me?

72
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,600
Yes.

73
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,600
Imagine that the roof
of the storage closet

74
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,800
<i>collapses on your</i>

75
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,200
favorite floor buffer.

76
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,700
Which then starts overheating.

77
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,200
Why would i have
a favorite floor buffer?

78
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,000
Okay.

79
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,500
Maybe the electrical works
got banged up in there

80
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,700
from stuff falling on it.

81
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,100
Hmm, interesting.

82
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,700
Brain damage leading
to hypothalamic dysregulation.

83
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,500
Nah.

84
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,500
If you're brought in
covered in rubble,

85
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,700
it's all about
the mri's.

86
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,600
We'd have seen that.

87
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,400
Come on!

88
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,300
You gotta earn that fiver.

89
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,400
Or stuff
leaked in the holes,

90
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,200
messing it up.

91
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,100
Lacerations leave
multiple portals for infection.

92
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,500
Bacterial would have
responded to the antibiotics.

93
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,600
Too high for viral.

94
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,500
Parasites or fungus
is possible.

95
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,900
Or maybe lupus.

96
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,700
My grandma has lupus.

97
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,300
Okay, autoimmune.

98
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,600
<i>I'll run a lupus panel.</i>

99
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,100
Infection fits best.

100
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,800
Complete history
would be helpful.

101
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,900
Which leads to the worst
part of the job.

102
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,400
Dealing with
the floor buffer's family.

103
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,400
We talked
every couple of weeks,

104
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,600
but ben would know
better than l...

105
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,300
no farms,
no travel anywhere weird.

106
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,600
You get that, dr. Buffer?

107
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,300
No travel, no farm.

108
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,800
The file says she was sick
before the building collapsed.

109
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,000
<i>(ben)</i>
I figured
it was just a cold.

110
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,200
Why, do you think's related?

111
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,800
Her being sick
and her being sick?

112
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,100
Often is.

113
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,900
She was unconscious
when i found her.

114
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,900
We'd been fighting.

115
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,600
I just want to...

116
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,500
just tell me
she's gonna be okay.

117
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,500
I'm not even sure
you're gonna be okay.

118
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,000
We're gonna
make her all better.

119
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,900
Showoff.

120
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,100
You oughta be nicer
to people.

121
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,000
Where are we going?

122
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,300
You know how the laughter

123
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,900
of little children
is infectious?

124
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,500
Well, parasites and fungi
are even more so.

125
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,800
We're gonna find out
which one is making

126
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,800
her brain bubble over.

127
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,800
Where, the building?

128
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,400
Epa's doing that job
for us.

129
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,400
They say it's clean.

130
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,700
Which means we're making
a pilgrimage

131
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,000
to castle blackberry.

132
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,000
Her name's bradbury.

133
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,500
I should ask them for keys.

134
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,300
No need.

135
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm sure we can find
a large rock somewhere.

136
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,600
I'm not breaking in
to somebody's house.

137
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,200
I got principles.

138
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,500
I got some loose change here
says you don't.

139
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,600
I'm not doing this.

140
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,700
For less than a 50.

141
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,100
Where's the restaurant?

142
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,900
What restaurant?

143
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,600
The one you said you were
taking me to for lunch.

144
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,200
Oh, uh,
this one's homier.

145
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,000
Dibs on the cold pizza.

146
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,600
I'm sure it looked easier
on youtube.

147
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,700
Oops!

148
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,400
Yeah, you don't
need a team.

149
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,100
You can't even get arrested
without company.

150
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:58,900
You're right.

151
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,200
Only one solution.

152
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,100
Never replace them.
Ever.

153
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,200
Do you need help?

154
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,300
Yeah, yeah, patronize
the poor cripple.

155
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,000
Ow.

156
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,200
Let me get that.

157
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:10,900
I got it.

158
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,500
Will you... let me...
just let me get it.

159
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,500
I'll check the bedroom.

160
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,200
Some interesting mold
on the windowsill here!

161
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,100
It's gonna
take me a while.

162
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,500
<i>I'll cover the bathroom.</i>

163
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,600
She had a secret diary.

164
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,300
Is there any other kind?

165
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,700
What are you doing?

166
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,300
There's a sale
on liquid tide.

167
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,600
If you're broke,

168
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,500
i can lend you a tiny bit
of the money i owe you.

169
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,500
No, no, i wouldn't put you
in that position.

170
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
What does the diary say?

171
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,000
It's basically a list
of her sexual encounters.

172
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,400
<i>Boys, girls,</i>

173
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,900
vibrating appliances.

174
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,100
If it was, you'd be quoting,
not summarizing.

175
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,600
This is a parade
of sad banalities.

176
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,000
<i>"I can hardly get out of bed.</i>

177
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,100
Feeling blue."

178
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,300
Then, three months ago,

179
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,500
<i>turns into a parade</i>
of happy banalities.

180
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,900
"Starting to turn the corner.

181
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,400
Job's looking up."

182
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,700
We can stop swabbing.

183
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,100
Her clichés
are getting healthier.

184
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,100
Or she's less depressed.

185
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,200
Aren't there pills
that do that?

186
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,600
Antidepressants
don't cause fever.

187
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,200
<i>Not on their own.</i>

188
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,400
<i>But the e.r. Didn't know</i>

189
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,600
she was on m.a.o.
Inhibitors,

190
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,000
so they gave her demerol.

191
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,800
It's a nasty combo.

192
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,500
So all you have to do
is convince this kid

193
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,300
that his girlfriend
had a secret doctor,

194
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,700
and a secret stash,

195
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,200
and a secret life.

196
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,000
It's been a while
since a patient

197
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,200
took a swing at you.

198
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,000
Can i watch?

199
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,300
I only have to convince
the mother.

200
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,500
Actually...

201
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,500
i don't have
to convince anyone.

202
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,300
This it total crap.

203
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,000
If she was seeing
a psychiatrist, i'd know.

204
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,500
If she was on drugs,
i'd know.

205
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,000
Mrs. Bradbury,
please sign the form

206
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,400
so we can
start the dialysis.

207
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,500
But why antidepressants?
I don't understand!

208
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,300
Mrs. Bradbury,
please sign the forms

209
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,500
so we can
start the dialysis.

210
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,300
Stop saying that.

211
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,500
Dr. Buffer,
what is going on?

212
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,800
What aren't you telling us?

213
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,100
He's a janitor?

214
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,300
More significantly,
a blabbermouth.

215
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,700
House, shut up!

216
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,400
I am very sorry
how dr. House handled this.

217
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,400
It is completely unforgivable.

218
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,900
Except if he's right.

219
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
Dialysis will filter
her blood.

220
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,800
There's nothing to filter.

221
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,400
Save her life.

222
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,900
She wasn't depressed.

223
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,300
I'm miserable around ben.

224
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,200
Not me. I like ben.

225
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,800
February 12th.

226
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,200
Either she's depressed,

227
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,500
or she just
thinks you're a jerk.

228
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,500
Neither suggests
that you should be the one

229
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,000
directing
her medical treatment.

230
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,200
Does the diary say

231
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,800
my daughter's taking
these drugs?

232
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,900
No, but medically...

233
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,300
did you find drugs
in their home?

234
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,500
She's probably hiding them
in her purse.

235
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,000
I thought it would be rude
to go searching

236
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,300
under 1,000 tons of rubble.

237
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,700
This was months ago.

238
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,400
We were in a fight.

239
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,500
It doesn't mean
she's depressed.

240
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,700
And it doesn't mean
she doesn't love me.

241
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,500
Fine, maybe the diary
proves nothing.

242
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,200
On the other hand,
half the country's

243
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,800
<i>on antidepressants.</i>

244
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,400
And it fits her symptoms
perfectly.

245
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,400
No ring
on your daughter's finger

246
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,300
means you make
the decisions.

247
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,500
I'm not sure
that i know her

248
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,800
well enough anymore.

249
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,100
You really
wanna risk her life

250
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,600
<i>on how well he knows her?</i>

251
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,900
Wilson, you idiot.

252
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,100
<i>(electronically masked voice)</i>
Listen carefully,

253
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,300
<i>and no one</i>
will get hurt.

254
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,900
<i>You must follow</i>
these instructions.

255
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,600
Any attempt to contact
the f.b.i.

256
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,100
Or other
law enforcement agencies

257
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,400
or... cutty...

258
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,900
will be met with...

259
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,000
and a large coke.

260
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
No ice.

261
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,100
Give it back.

262
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,400
What happened?

263
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,100
<i>Did someone...</i>

264
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,100
kidnap your guitar?

265
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,900
A $12,000
1967 flying v?

266
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:17,800
Or something?

267
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,700
Where'd you hide it?

268
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,500
I'm flattered you would
consider me

269
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,400
this bold
and brilliant.

270
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,000
No, 'cause it takes a crl...

271
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,400
it takes
a criminal mastermind

272
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,300
to pull off a heist
from an unlocked,

273
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,700
unguarded room
down the hall.

274
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,500
What do you want?

275
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,200
Me? Nothing.

276
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,800
<i>But i'm sure the kidnapper</i>

277
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,400
wants what
every kidnapper wants.

278
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,800
To see you interview
five to seven

279
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,400
well-qualified
fellowship candidates.

280
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,100
I don't need a team.

281
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,000
You were bouncing ideas
off a janitor.

282
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,300
And solved the case!

283
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,900
Hi. I'm dr. Cuddy.

284
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,700
If you can hear
what i'm saying,

285
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,600
blink once.

286
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,800
You can't talk right now.

287
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,000
You have a tube
down your throat.

288
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,100
And try not to move
your head.

289
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,100
You've been
in a terrible accident.

290
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,600
<i>But it looks like</i>
you will have

291
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,900
<i>no permanent injuries.</i>

292
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,500
You've had a bad fever,
but it's gone now.

293
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,000
I've been here
the whole time, honey, okay?

294
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,600
This is very important.

295
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,500
I need you

296
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,300
to blink one for yes,
twice for no.

297
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,700
Were you seeing
a psychiatrist?

298
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,400
Were you on
m.a.o. Inhibitors?

299
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,600
The antidepressant.

300
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,300
Megan, it's okay.

301
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,300
It doesn't matter, okay?
I love you.

302
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,800
Honey?
Honey, what's wrong?

303
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,200
Megan, are you all right?

304
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,700
What's happening?
Are we upsetting her?

305
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,900
Heart is beating too fast.

306
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,100
Get the family out of here.

307
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,600
Megan? Megan?

308
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,100
Charging to 200.
Meg, meg.

309
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:44,800
Megan.

310
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,500
Clear!

311
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,700
We shocked her back
into sinus rhythm,

312
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,000
but she's still tachycardic.

313
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,500
Fascinating.

314
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,700
Equally fascinating is...

315
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,000
why are you here?

316
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,800
I was gonna leave you alone
if you won the bet.

317
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,100
But you lost.

318
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,300
I explained the fever.

319
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,800
Which is all
we were talking about.

320
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,100
She confirmed
the antidepressants.

321
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,900
Go bet
with someone else

322
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,000
if you want
to explain the heart problems.

323
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,500
She confirmed them by winking.

324
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,500
Maybe there was a cute guy
across the room.

325
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,800
She got better
when i treated her.

326
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,200
Even i'm not that cute.

327
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,300
Two unrelated symptoms,

328
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,200
just a coincidence.

329
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,800
Or you're grasping at straws
to avoid admitting

330
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,000
you can't do this
on your own.

331
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,300
Fine, what explains
the fever

332
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,600
<i>and persistent tachycardia?</i>

333
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,700
Could be anything.
Endocarditis.

334
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,400
Nope.
Fever, no infection.

335
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,600
Um...

336
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,900
keep going,
you're doing great.

337
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,400
You win.

338
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,300
I don't believe you.

339
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,300
I'm not gonna
play this game.

340
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,400
Just give me
the damn resumes.

341
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,200
And my guitar.

342
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,600
I don't have it.

343
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,800
<i>Although</i>
i did hear some...

344
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,200
plangent strumming
from under that couch earlier.

345
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,400
Wow.

346
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,700
This kidnapper
isn't just bold,

347
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,700
he's diabolical.

348
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,400
I guess he realized

349
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,000
he probably shouldn't
give it back to you

350
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
until after
you've had the interviews.

351
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,400
Huh, you didn't
write anything.

352
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,300
So what you're saying is,
you didn't find

353
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,900
that one big explanation...

354
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,600
'cause there isn't one.

355
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,200
Clever.

356
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,400
Well, let's just say...

357
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,000
your antidepressant theory
does explain the fever.

358
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,900
<i>What about the heart?</i>

359
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,600
And don't say
a building fell on her.

360
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,400
Okay... [coughs]

361
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,900
A structure collapsed...

362
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,200
shut up.
Come on, it fits.

363
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,200
Crushed musculature
releases potassium,

364
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,100
<i>causes v-tac...</i>

365
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,800
you'd think
she'd get crushed syndrome

366
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,200
after she was crushed,
not two days later.

367
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,600
Microvascular occlusions.

368
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,500
Takes that long
for the blood to reperfuse.

369
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,100
She'd have a baggy heart.

370
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,800
Echo it to confirm.

371
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,100
Is crush syndrome
good or bad?

372
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,100
Does it sound good?

373
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,800
I mean, compared
to the other things it could be.

374
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,100
There are no other things
it could be.

375
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,400
Then why are you testing her?

376
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,900
Excellent question.

377
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,500
What... what is it?

378
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,400
The heart's fine.

379
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,200
Why is she sweating?
Her fever's back.

380
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,500
Why would her fever be back?

381
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,600
I can't say.

382
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,700
You don't know?

383
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,300
I know,

384
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,200
i just can't say.

385
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,700
'Cause you'll hit me.

386
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,900
Let's discuss this
in front of witnesses.

387
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,000
The dt's?

388
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,500
So she's an alcoholic now?

389
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,900
Her first fever
was from the medication

390
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,700
for her depression.

391
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,600
Or you're wrong.

392
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,200
The second fever was from
the self-medication

393
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,100
for depression.

394
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,000
This is insane.

395
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You don't think
i would have noticed her

396
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,300
being constantly drunk?

397
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,000
You were practically
living with sylvia plath.

398
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,900
You didn't notice that.

399
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,100
Tone it down
or i will hit you.

400
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,000
Fine, i'll do
liver enzyme tests.

401
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,700
<i>(cuddy)</i>
Liver enzymes
can also be elevated

402
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,500
from musculoskeletal trauma.

403
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,400
They'd be there
whether she had

404
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,400
a drinking problem or not.

405
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,600
<i>They don't know that.</i>

406
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,600
Just pretend to confirm.

407
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,900
What's the treatment?

408
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,000
She's not an alcoholic.

409
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,600
Hair of the dog,
iv alcohol.

410
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,200
Taper it off
after a few days.

411
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,200
She's sick and traumatized
and half-dead.

412
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,000
You wanna make her drunk.

413
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,700
Just do it.

414
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,200
You can't do this.

415
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,700
We lived together,
we were gonna have kids.

416
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,800
You barely even know her.

417
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,700
Apparently, neither did you.

418
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,700
<i>Hello?</i>

419
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,500
Hi, could i speak
to trevor... kaufman?

420
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,100
<i>Yo yo, it's trev.</i>
What up?

421
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,400
This is
dr. Gregory house.

422
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,600
Can you come in tomorrow
to interview?

423
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,400
<i>House?</i>
Are you serious?

424
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,700
<i>Awesome!</i>

425
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,300
<i>[Whispering]</i>
Hey, dude, i got
the house interview!

426
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,600
<i>(second man)</i>
Oh, look at me!

427
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,100
<i>I got the house interview!</i>

428
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:27,900
<i>(trevor)</i>
Dude, shut up!
I'm on the phone!

429
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,600
<i>Shut up!</i>
I'm so cool!

430
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,900
<i>Give me the phone back.</i>
Give me the phone back!

431
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,900
I got a page.

432
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,300
No, you didn't.

433
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,700
They called a code.

434
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,700
No, they didn't.

435
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,600
You got a page,
but not from us.

436
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,600
<i>Did you ever see</i>
raid on entebbe?

437
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,300
Yeah, in the end,
they release the hostages.

438
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,600
<i>How's that</i>
working for you?

439
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,800
The ugandans played fair.

440
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,400
They didn't move the hostages
on the israelis.

441
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,200
Once again,
i am in awe

442
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,000
<i>of the kidnapper's</i>
tactical brilliance.

443
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,200
<i>What is el fuego del amor</i>

444
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,600
<i>and why</i>
do you need ten of them?

445
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,200
It's a telanovela.
I'm learning spanish.

446
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,100
Say adios.

447
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,800
Are you erasing my tivo?

448
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,900
House,
not the season finale.

449
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,700
E
with terrorists.

450
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,400
<i>I smoke them</i>
out of their hidey-holes.

451
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,400
Do you know
what terrorists do

452
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,500
when you don't negotiate?

453
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,800
They terrorize.

454
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,600
Bring it on.

455
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,000
Fever's down.

456
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,300
Sweating has abated.
Heart's working fine.

457
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I guess house was right.
Again.

458
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,100
That's good news, right?

459
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,200
It is good news.

460
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,700
So what does this mean,
she's an alcoholic?

461
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,300
There's no other explanation?

462
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,900
No, sorry.

463
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,300
It doesn't make any sense.

464
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,000
Dr. Cuddy...

465
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,500
she's doing this thing
with her mouth again.

466
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,300
It's been on and off
for the last couple hours.

467
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,800
<i>Is she trying to talk?</i>

468
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,000
<i>(cuddy)</i>
No.

469
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,900
I think she's screaming.

470
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,200
Morning!

471
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:31,910
Uh-huh.

472
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,770
Where did you come from?

473
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:36,410
Apes, if you believe the democrats.

474
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,880
I heard you were there when i was proven right.

475
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:39,970
The alcohol treatment took away

476
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,300
the heart and fever problems.

477
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:43,960
Yes, i was also there when you were proven wrong.

478
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:46,900
She'd been silently screaming for two hours.

479
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:49,120
Amylase and lipase are through the roof.

480
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:50,960
She has pancreatitis.

481
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,870
Iv alcohol can cause pancreatitis.

482
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,440
Okay.

483
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:04,700
You're not gonna argue with me?

484
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:05,970
Nope.

485
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,110
You think i'm right? Nope.

486
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,040
Why not?

487
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,780
Nope.

488
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,050
It's not really a yes or no question.

489
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,060
Which is why i'm not answering it.

490
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,710
If it's not the iv alcohol,

491
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,640
it's gotta be...

492
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,760
not interested.

493
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:25,060
If i'm wrong, she's gonna die.

494
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:25,590
Are you sure

495
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,680
you're still dean of medicine.

496
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,630
I'm not interested in arguing because i'm not interested

497
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,820
in enabling you.

498
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:33,730
You need someone to bounce ideas off of.

499
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,970
You need a team.

500
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,000
Don't follow me.

501
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,060
M.a.o. Inhibitor caused the fever.

502
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,780
Alcohol caused the pancreatitis.

503
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:51,140
Alcohol withdrawal caused the v-tach.

504
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,060
Le."????

505
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,270
<i>(cuddy) you're wrong.</i>

506
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,790
Well, who are you gonna believe?

507
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,470
A classic toy or a woman who,

508
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,120
if she had any confidence in her ideas,

509
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:02,620
wouldn't feel the need to distract you

510
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,130
with a water bra?

511
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,860
Are you really just gonna treat the pancreatitis?

512
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,350
Are you here to enable me?

513
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,010
I don't want her to die because you're stubborn.

514
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,740
Wow, so you can enable and rationalize

515
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:14,200
at the same time.

516
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,550
Guess you are still dean of medicine.

517
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:17,430
If you're right, then this guy,

518
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,120
who's not an ass, who's not a workaholic,

519
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,940
<i>who's not a sociopath,</i>

520
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,930
has somehow missed both her depression

521
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,920
and severe alcoholism.

522
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,380
Yes, imagine that, a couple with secrets.

523
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,470
Why would she lie?

524
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:33,660
<i>Okay, alcoholism you don't wanna advertise.</i>

525
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:35,160
But...

526
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,530
if you're right, there'd be an abnormality

527
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:42,530
on the pancreas.

528
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,010
At least do an mri to confirm.

529
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:09,220
Oh, my god.

530
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,450
This guy means business.

531
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,340
<i>Or guys.</i>

532
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:14,420
????

533
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:15,990
Could be multiple guys.

534
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:19,120
Or a gal. Who knows?

535
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,260
All i can say is, this reeks of boldness.

536
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:27,600
I am not hiring a team.

537
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,670
You ever tighten a guitar string

538
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:32,210
really, really slowly?

539
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,910
Past the point it can handle the strain?

540
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,870
It makes this weird sound.

541
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:41,580
Almost like a scream.

542
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,190
<i>I thought this was gonna be fun.</i>

543
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,540
I messed with you, you messed with me.

544
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,300
Eventually, you give in.

545
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,550
But you've shown a startling lack of humor,

546
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,070
which got me thinking.

547
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:06,940
Oh, god.

548
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,250
<i>What's the real reason</i>

549
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,380
<i>you won't hire a team?</i>

550
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,140
I told you, i don't need a team.

551
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,160
Then hire three people

552
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,260
and let 'em sit on their asses.

553
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,140
That wouldn't be right.

554
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,150
Three years ago, you hired a team.

555
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,030
<i>What's changed?</i>

556
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,550
I have become a man of principle.

557
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,340
I've gotten smarter.

558
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,410
What answer will make socrates shut up?

559
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,680
What's changed is,

560
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,150
????

561
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:26,320
<i>You connected with a team.</i>

562
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:28,010
You worked with a team.

563
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,530
And you lost a team.

564
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:31,900
Damn.

565
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,070
<i>There's no abnormalities in her pancreas.</i>

566
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:36,040
You fall in love, you get married.

567
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,510
50% chance it'll end in misery.

568
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,410
Hiring employees can be even tougher.

569
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:42,140
Because you know, eventually,

570
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,160
they're gonna leave.

571
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,430
There's increased t2 signal on her hepatic capsule.

572
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:48,990
If you know what i mean.

573
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,180
You got hurt.

574
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:53,650
Get over it.

575
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,050
Now, if you'll excuse me,

576
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,660
my patient is about to start bleeding

577
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:01,480
out of her mouth and anus.

578
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:14,390
Internal bleeding.

579
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,900
Not anymore.

580
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:17,710
Now it's all over the place.

581
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,870
Why are you here?

582
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,820
That's my patient down there.

583
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:24,530
You're here because i'm here.

584
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,400
I am done enabling you.

585
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,450
I know.

586
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:39,500
The alcohol didn't cause the pancreatitis,

587
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:40,380
the internal bleeding did.

588
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,220
The question is, what caused the internal bleeding?

589
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:43,360
I hate myself.

590
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,330
You do know that the patient

591
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,410
had a building land on her.

592
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:46,290
Four days ago.

593
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,780
Bleeding can start at any time.

594
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:49,100
It's bleeding from five different sites.

595
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,110
You think they synchronized their watches?

596
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:53,060
She got warfarin after her hip surgery.

597
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:55,460
It's designed to mess with bleeding patterns.

598
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,230
Fever, heart, and bleeding.

599
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,180
Three problems,

600
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,930
three completely different explanations.

601
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:01,550
She must be the unluckiest woman

602
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:02,150
in the world.

603
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,100
I only cling to this crazy theory

604
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,160
because it's been proven right

605
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:06,270
every step of the way.

606
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,490
Each treatment worked.

607
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:09,720
Yes, she looks perfectly healthy.

608
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,520
<i>This much bleeding</i>

609
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:13,110
is a symptom of something more.

610
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:15,280
And you need a team because you're wrong

611
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:18,560
and you're gonna kill this woman.

612
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,800
If i had a team, this patient would be dead.

613
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,540
Because they'd be here instead of me

614
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,680
and they wouldn't notice the size

615
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,550
of this woman's uterus.

616
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:39,750
Hi!

617
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,220
How's it going?

618
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:42,590
Mind if i observe?

619
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,380
Got a big room up top window

620
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,290
just for that.

621
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,140
Oh, stop that.

622
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:49,780
You wanna look at vaginas,

623
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,490
<i>there are websites for that.</i>

624
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:53,710
Think i'm made of money?

625
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:56,170
Can you get him out of here?

626
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:58,690
Enlarged uterus.

627
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,790
Means that she was recently pregnant.

628
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,180
<i>She's a good liar, but i doubt she could</i>

629
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:05,390
hide a baby from her boyfriend.

630
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,260
Scraping in the uterus

631
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,410
indicates that she had an abortion.

632
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,430
But nothing in her medical history.

633
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,010
Only one reason to hide an abortion.

634
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,960
Boyfriend wants babies, she doesn't.

635
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:18,990
She's bleeding everywhere.

636
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,450
Unless the guy was performing an abortion

637
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:22,130
with a shotgun...

638
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,130
stop enabling him!

639
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:26,360
It's not the abortion, it's what she did after.

640
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:28,080
The boyfriend would have noticed condoms.

641
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,980
He would notice abstinence.

642
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,690
He would not notice the pill.

643
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:37,650
Which means, i don't need a team!

644
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:45,240
Hey, where's your mother-in-common-law?

645
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,040
Dr. House, this is doug mcmurtry.

646
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:50,860
His girlfriend was working with megan when...

647
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:53,220
she's dead?

648
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,890
She passed this morning.

649
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:59,060
Well, then why are you still here?

650
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,350
I need the old lady's consent

651
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,700
to do some treatment.

652
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,380
What'd you find out?

653
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:06,360
I wish i could tell you,

654
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,920
but since you're not legally related...

655
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:10,770
did you find out?

656
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:17,790
Your girlfriend had an abortion.

657
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,100
See why i didn't tell you?

658
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:25,390
I'd be insane to also tell you

659
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:28,430
that she's on the pill.

660
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:30,880
No, she's not.

661
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:31,840
If they'd known she was on it,

662
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,080
they wouldn't have given her a blood thinner

663
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,300
after her hip surgery.

664
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:37,660
The combination caused the bleeding.

665
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:40,060
It's good news. It's treatable.

666
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,490
Just give her tamoxifen.

667
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:42,510
Which is normally a breast cancer...

668
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:43,930
it's not true.

669
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,840
'Cause, uh, we wanna have kids.

670
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,880
Huh.

671
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,350
See, i already did the blood tests.

672
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,680
And either she lied to you,

673
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,940
or her blood lied to us.

674
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:10,750
Tell megan i'm glad she's gonna be okay.

675
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:20,330
How are you doing?

676
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,500
I got cancer.

677
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,720
You're on an oncology ward.

678
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,320
Everybody's got cancer.

679
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,510
You want sympathy, you wanna try

680
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:29,690
the "hardly anything wrong with m

681
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:32,380
in fact, why don't i take you there right now?

682
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:33,920
How sick are you?

683
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,230
Can you walk?

684
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,220
Are you a doctor?

685
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:37,450
Admitted today.

686
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,510
First day of a five day chemo course.

687
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:40,470
Yeah, you can walk.

688
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:41,850
Come on, let's go.

689
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:44,560
Does dr. Wilson know you're here?

690
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,830
Well, if he didn't, this would be really stupid.

691
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:52,210
'Cause then he wouldn't know where his patient was.

692
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,170
No, the room upstairs is bigger.

693
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:55,110
It's got cable.

694
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,850
Better looking sponge bath nurses.

695
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:57,550
Oh.

696
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:58,590
If you feel sick,

697
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:00,890
you call me directly, not Dr. Wilson.

698
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:04,440
He's getting his last set of hormone shots.

699
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[Beeping]

700
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:16,380
You put her on tamoxifen? 
An antl-cancer drug?

701
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,930
It blocks estrogen receptors.

702
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,640
Does it also block breathing

703
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:21,090
and kidney function?

704
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:23,030
She's crashing.

705
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,730
Doesn't mean i was wrong.

706
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:28,850
R. Martin.

707
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,160
We're bringing his patient 
over now, thanks.

708
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,800
Anybody here a doctor?

709
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,780
Kidney failure,

710
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,790
spiking fever, breathing difficulties.

711
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:41,260
Any theories?

712
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,410
Am i in an m. Night shyamalan movie?

713
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:49,600
You're house, right?

714
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:53,880
Okay, i assume you know me
 because i once insulted you,

715
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,940
your patient, or your relatives.

716
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,180
If that's so, i apologize.

717
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:58,500
I was drunk that day.

718
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:01,080
Patient initially presented with crush injuries.

719
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:03,520
I know you because Dr. Cuddy 
issued a memo.

720
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:08,670
Telling to cooperate fully with me?

721
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,000
Nope.

722
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,540
I figured that was a long shot.

723
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:16,390
Anybody here not get that memo?

724
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:27,540
<i>Fungal infection.</i>

725
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:30,030
Don't you have a patient?

726
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,180
She shot herself in the leg while high on meth.

727
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:34,550
Wouldn't hurt her to be in pain for a little while.

728
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,920
Fungal infection would be in her eyes by now.

729
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:37,960
Haemophylus.

730
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:40,480
Doesn't explain the remitting fever.

731
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:41,580
<i>You've heard...</i>

732
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,740
that i've got a job opening, right?

733
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,730
I just care about people.

734
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:48,010
Acute respiratory distress syndrome.

735
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:50,080
A.r.d.s. Doesn't explain anything.

736
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,040
<i>Except the breathing.</i>

737
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:53,040
If you care about people, 
you're not getting the job.

738
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:56,650
I was lying. Crush syndrome.

739
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,540
Doesn't explain the breathing.

740
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,120
What was the problem with A.R.D.S?

741
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:02,300
Only explained the breathing.

742
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:03,210
And the crush syndrome?

743
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:05,490
It didn't explain the breathing.

744
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,130
You a fan of symmetry?

745
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:08,390
Sure.

746
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,940
Weird.

747
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,930
'Cause your eyes are lopsided.

748
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,580
And by eyes, i mean breasts.

749
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:20,120
A.r.d.s. And crush syndrome,

750
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:21,670
both reactions to severe trauma.

751
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,040
Why can't she have both?

752
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:25,480
Because...

753
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,250
because then there's nothing we could do.

754
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,260
Boy, you remind me of someone.

755
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,670
Send me your resume.

756
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:37,820
I'll put it on top of the pile

757
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,910
that i'm never gonna look at.

758
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:50,400
I couldn't leave.

759
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,370
You don't seem like the type of person

760
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:55,100
who would give up on giving up.

761
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,740
I love her.

762
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,030
You love somebody.

763
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:01,310
Someone who didn't drink, 
who wanted to have babies.

764
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,790
And wasn't miserable.

765
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,310
I know she lied, but...

766
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,380
what are you doing?

767
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,370
Why are you saying these things to him?

768
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,580
The woman you love doesn't exist.

769
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:13,970
This woman is dying.

770
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,210
<i>She has acute respiratory</i>

771
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,550
distress syndrome and crush syndrome.

772
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,450
Her body's basically giving up.

773
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,360
<i>We can keep her on</i>

774
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:23,410
supportive dialysis and hope for the best.

775
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:30,880
Never mind.

776
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,350
She has a lump on her arm.

777
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:35,460
Does that mean you're wrong?

778
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,200
That would be good news for you guys.

779
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:41,390
We'll know after the biopsy.

780
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:47,620
Which patient is that?

781
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,710
Megan... house's patient.

782
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:51,460
Yep.

783
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,880
Didn't you get my memo?

784
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:53,740
Sure.

785
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:55,780
Got both memos.

786
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:58,050
Both.

787
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:01,500
And the second memo said to 
ignore the first memo?

788
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,940
Yep.

789
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,730
Seemed odd.

790
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:08,360
Did an mri and... of course you did.

791
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:10,080
What'd you find?

792
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,250
<i>It's kind of freaky.</i>

793
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:14,580
She's got growths all over the place.

794
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,320
She's got tumors?

795
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,800
Not exactly.

796
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,370
The growths are 
eosinophilic granulomas.

797
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:27,870
They are usually from allergic reactions.

798
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:29,300
I'm putting her on steroids.

799
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,460
Allergy to what? 
She doesn't have allergies.

800
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:33,710
We don't know.

801
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,530
<i>Unfortunately,</i>

802
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:35,970
the only drug she's had enough of

803
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,420
to have this kind of 
reaction is cephalosporin.

804
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,900
And why is that unfortunate?

805
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,700
Because she was on it two months ago.

806
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,610
That's what you mean, right?

807
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,870
She took it for strep throat,

808
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,280
<i>so she can't be allergic to it.</i>

809
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,480
It would seem so.

810
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,690
What is this hospital doing to her?

811
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:49,960
She has had three

812
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:52,000
separate medical disasters.

813
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,170
<i>And now she's dying</i>

814
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:57,310
of an allergy she can't possibly have!

815
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,630
Mr. Lee, i just have to check...

816
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:27,670
sam?

817
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,660
Are you okay?

818
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,140
What are you doing here?

819
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:38,570
I was taking a nap.

820
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:41,600
Where's my patient?

821
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,910
<i>You stole my patient.</i>

822
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,760
You kidnapped my guitar.

823
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:48,970
Give him back.

824
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:50,630
Only when you give her back.

825
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,150
It's a she?

826
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:54,020
Well, it's certainly not a dude.

827
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,290
It's a guitar! You took a human being!

828
00:36:57,610 --> 00:37:00,120
Now who doesn't have a sense of humor?

829
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,970
I'm monitoring the guy remotely.

830
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:02,870
What are you, listening

831
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:05,230
for the distant sound of screaming?

832
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,700
The nurses know to call me.

833
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,350
They don't know who he is!

834
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,050
His name's right there on the chart.

835
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,460
Now go away. I'm working.

836
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:12,750
They give him the wrong meds,

837
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,890
who the hell knows what's gonna happen?

838
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,660
<i>House!</i>

839
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:24,580
Bad things would happen.

840
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,910
He's in room 318.

841
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,850
What are you... what are you giving megan?

842
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:47,140
Megan? Nothing.

843
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:49,380
Nothing? What's going on?

844
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:50,310
What's wrong with her?

845
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:52,310
Her? Nothing.

846
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:53,960
Then why are you giving her drugs?

847
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,580
Just some amphetamines to wake her up.

848
00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:00,550
Everything could be explained 
by her lying to you.

849
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,080
The antidepressants, the drinking, the pill.

850
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,110
Until now.

851
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:07,570
Now she's allergic to something

852
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,850
the chart says she's not allergic to.

853
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:10,800
<i>That's not her lying,</i>

854
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,060
that's the chart lying.

855
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,030
Which doesn't make s.

856
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:21,570
Do you know liz masters?

857
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:22,080
No.

858
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,630
????

859
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,020
That was her boyfriend who you met 
outside the morgue.

860
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:29,880
Mm. This is her chart.

861
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,410
<i>She's on m.a.o. Inhibitors for depression.</i>

862
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,540
<i>She's on the pill.</i>

863
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,870
<i>She had an abortion a month ago.</i>

864
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:39,640
And she's allergic to cephalosporin.

865
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:40,440
What's going on here?

866
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:43,080
What, are you saying this isn't megan?

867
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,800
Yes.

868
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:56,230
Ben.

869
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:57,780
<i>(ben) since when?</i>

870
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:59,420
Since right before i began pretending

871
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,320
i loved it.

872
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,970
She's the same size as megan,

873
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,860
same build, h cosameair lor.

874
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,960
They were both horribly injured.

875
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:06,860
Unrecognizably.

876
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:08,930
Emt teams do not second guess

877
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,380
family members' identifications

878
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:12,470
at accident scenes.

879
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,220
<i>No.</i>

880
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:17,700
Liz died yesterday. This isn't liz.

881
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,890
I know megan.

882
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:23,160
I know her hair.

883
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:24,970
<i>I know her hands.</i>

884
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,610
I know her smell. Oh.

885
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:33,300
What's your name?

886
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:39,420
Liz...

887
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:43,120
oh, god!

888
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:54,310
Your girlfriend never lied to you.

889
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:49,880
I did it all by myself, mommy.

890
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,650
You talking to me?

891
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,970
Go away.

892
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:06,790
I did it all by myself, mommy.

893
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,480
How'd you know it was me?

894
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:09,890
There's a scent given off

895
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,860
by wounded, feral cats.

896
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:13,510
You were wrong.

897
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:15,910
I got everything right.

898
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,270
Just treated the wrong...

899
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,930
they had a good relationship.

900
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:20,140
He couldn't even identify her.

901
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:22,190
And you were wrong about needing a team.

902
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:23,790
She almost died.

903
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,220
So i almost need a team.

904
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:29,640
You were content with your 
"people are idiots" theory.

905
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:31,590
But cameron would never have 
accepted that

906
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:35,140
this guy knew nothing about the 
love of his life.

907
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,710
And as soon as you claimed it 
was multiple conditions,

908
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:40,170
foreman would have done anything 
to prove you wrong.

909
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:43,840
And then chase would have done 
anything to prove you right.

910
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:44,780
Any one of them

911
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:47,480
would have solved this days ago.

912
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,830
Hire a team.

913
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,020
I don't care how you do it.

914
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:57,140
Just do it.

915
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:04,080
<i>(house) sometimes, i am wrong.</i>

916
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:08,300
T for observation.

For reading people in situations.

918
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:13,420

This will be the longest job interview of your life.

00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:19,350
I will test you in ways that you will often

921
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:23,300
consider unfair, demeaning, and illegal.

922
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:27,420
And you will often be right.

923
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:30,070
Look to your left.

924
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,840
Now look to your right.

925
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:35,890
By the end of six weeks,

926
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,660
one of you will be gone.

927
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:42,100

928
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:45,200
