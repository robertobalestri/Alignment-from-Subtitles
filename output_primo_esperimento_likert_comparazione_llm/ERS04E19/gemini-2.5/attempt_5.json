    "detailed_evaluation": "The episode tackles the theme of abortion primarily through the aftermath of a clinic bombing, presenting various scenarios and viewpoints. \n\n1.  **Condemnation of Anti-Abortion Violence:** The narrative strongly condemns the bombing ('Blowing up clinics. Bastards!'). A protester's rhetoric linking abortion to genocide is explicitly rejected by Carol Hathaway as inciting violence ('That sign is a call to arms... The only job it's done is to encourage violence'). This frames extreme anti-abortion positions negatively.\n\n2.  **Prioritization of Patient Life/Health:** Dr. Weaver insists Dr. Del Amico complete an emergency abortion on Brianna Thomas, who is hemorrhaging post-procedure ('Your patient was hemorrhaging. Complete the AB... We need to evacuate the uterus. Now, doctor.'). This prioritizes the pregnant patient's immediate survival, a stance consistent with moderate pro-choice perspectives where medical necessity is a key factor.\n\n3.  **Acknowledging Complexity and Personal Conflict:** Dr. Del Amico's initial hesitation ('I couldn't complete the abortion... The fetus was so far along... The baby had a chance... It just felt wrong.') introduces personal conflict regarding a later-term procedure. However, she later contextualizes this, citing experiences with unsafe illegal abortions and reaffirming her professional commitment to patient choice, though admitting the specific case was difficult ('I've made it a priority to be the best doctor I can be... and to support all my patients' choices'). This acknowledges the emotional/moral complexity without adopting a pro-life stance.\n\n4.  **Empathy for Patient Circumstances:** Mark Greene shows empathy towards an older woman seeking a secret abortion due to complex family/financial reasons, helping her maintain confidentiality. This highlights the difficult personal contexts influencing abortion decisions, aligning with a pro-choice focus on individual circumstances.\n\n5.  **Nuance/Critique:** Carol critiques Brianna Thomas's reliance on abortion ('There are preferable forms of birth control than abortion... you're being irresponsible'). This specific interaction introduces a critique of perceived irresponsibility but doesn't condemn abortion itself.\n\n6.  **Fetal Viability vs. Patient Autonomy:** The case of Zoe Kearney (brain-dead at 6 months pregnant with a viable fetus) explores the status of the fetus but in the unique context of maternal brain death. The conflict is between the parents (wary of making Zoe an 'incubator') and the boyfriend (emphasizing Zoe's wish for the baby), and ultimately parental rights dominate the immediate decision. While highlighting fetal viability, it's a distinct scenario from a typical abortion decision.\n\nOverall, the episode condemns anti-abortion violence, prioritizes the pregnant patient's life in emergencies, shows empathy for complex personal reasons for seeking abortion, and acknowledges the emotional difficulty for both patients and providers. While not unequivocally affirming abortion in all circumstances (showcasing Dr. Del Amico's conflict and Carol's specific critique), the narrative leans towards supporting reproductive healthcare access and patient autonomy, especially contrasting it with dangerous extremism. Therefore, it aligns best with a 'Moderately Pro-Choice' position.",
