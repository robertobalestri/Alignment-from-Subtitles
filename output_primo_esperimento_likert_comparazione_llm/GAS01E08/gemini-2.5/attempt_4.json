    "detailed_evaluation": "The provided text primarily addresses the theme of abortion through the character Cristina Yang's actions and brief phone conversation. She explicitly states her decision to have an abortion ('I made my decision, and I made my appointment. I'll be there on the 16th.') and indicates resistance to external counseling ('I'm not coming in for a counseling session. I know all my options.'). This portrays a stance centered on individual autonomy and decisive personal choice. The narrative does not delve into the ethical considerations of fetal moral status, nor does it present any counterarguments or perspectives advocating against abortion (pro-life viewpoints). The context frames Cristina's decision as a secret she is keeping, aligning with the episode's broader theme of hidden truths, rather than presenting it as an ethical dilemma to be debated within the narrative itself. No other character engages with the topic of abortion. Given that the only perspective shown is one of resolute personal choice without internal conflict or external moral debate presented within the text, the dominant position clearly leans towards validating the individual's right to choose. Fetal considerations are entirely absent, and the focus is solely on Cristina's agency. Therefore, the text aligns with a 'Strongly Pro-Choice' framing.",
