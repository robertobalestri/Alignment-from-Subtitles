    "detailed_evaluation": "The episode's dialogues do not prominently feature the theme of abortion. While there are discussions about medical procedures, personal secrets, and ethical dilemmas, the topic of abortion is not directly addressed. The dominant themes revolve around personal relationships, medical ethics, and professional challenges rather than abortion. Therefore, the text does not align strongly with either pro-life or pro-choice positions on the abortion discourse scale.",
