The character Sonja is faced with a critical health crisis where the medical team acknowledges the serious risks she faces if she continues the pregnancy, and they strongly recommend termination for her safety. The medical team's acknowledgment of Sonja's desire to save her baby reflects an understanding of the emotional turmoil involved, as they present the decision as a necessary but painful option. This context indicates a balanced approach, emphasizing the motherâ€™s health while also recognizing the attachment to the fetus. On the scale provided, this aligns closely with a score of 0 (Neutral / Balanced), as it presents multiple angles without clearly favoring one side of the abortion debate over the other.",
