    "detailed_evaluation": "The episode's dialogues primarily revolve around workplace dynamics, personal grief, and medical diagnoses, with only a brief segment addressing abortion directly. The dominant position on abortion is expressed by the medical team's clinical and pragmatic approach to terminating an ectopic pregnancy to save the patient's life, framed as a medical necessity rather than an ethical debate. The patient's autonomy is respected, but the narrative does not deeply engage with broader pro-choice or pro-life arguments. The tone is neutral to moderately pro-choice, as the decision is presented as medically justified without overt moral judgment.",
