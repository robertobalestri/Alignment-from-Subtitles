    "detailed_evaluation": "The episode includes discussions on issues related to women's rights, such as feminism and sexual harassment, but does not directly engage with the topic of abortion. The closest reference to a pregnancy-related decision is the discussion about a woman's ectopic pregnancy and the medical necessity to remove it, highlighting her autonomy in accepting the procedure quickly. The woman states that she has no boyfriend or husband and is constantly on the road due to work, suggesting she prefers focusing on her career but does not express strong feelings about abortion in general. Her stance leans towards prioritizing her well-being and not pursuing motherhood, which resonates subtly with a pro-choice perspective by validating individual decisions based on personal life circumstances. The characters support her decision due to medical imperative rather than social or ethical discussion, which places this dialogue slightly leaning towards pro-choice but not overtly stating support for abortion rights.",
