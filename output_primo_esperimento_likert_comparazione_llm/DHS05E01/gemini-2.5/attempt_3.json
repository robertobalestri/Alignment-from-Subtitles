    "detailed_evaluation": "The episode features a storyline involving an ectopic pregnancy located dangerously in the patient's intestine, posing a severe, life-threatening risk. The primary discussion around terminating the pregnancy occurs between Dr. House and Dr. Hadley ('Thirteen'). House takes a pragmatic, medically focused stance, stating the fetus must be removed ('Yank the fetus') to save the patient's life, dismissing the possibility of saving the fetus as a 'fantasy' due to the high surgical risks. Thirteen briefly raises the question of the patient's potential desire ('What if she wants to keep the baby?') and the patient's agency ('She's a 37-year-old woman who deserves...'), introducing a moment considering the patient's perspective beyond pure medical necessity. However, this is quickly overridden by House's insistence on the medical reality and, crucially, by the patient's own immediate and unambiguous decision. When informed, the patient ('Lou') decisively chooses termination ('Remove the fetus. Absolutely.'), citing her life circumstances (single, demanding job). The narrative does not delve into the moral status of the fetus; the abortion is framed predominantly as a necessary medical intervention to save the pregnant person's life, coupled with the patient's clear and unchallenged choice based on her personal situation. While Thirteen introduces a choice-based element, the overwhelming weight is on medical necessity and the patient's pragmatic decision. Therefore, the dominant discourse aligns with prioritizing the pregnant individual's life and respecting her choice in a critical situation, positioning it strongly towards the pro-choice end of the spectrum within this specific, life-threatening context.",
