    "detailed_evaluation": "The episode primarily deals with an ectopic pregnancy discovered in the patient, Lou, implanted dangerously on her intestine. The discussion around resolving this pregnancy is heavily framed by its immediate life-threatening nature. Dr. House diagnoses the condition and matter-of-factly recommends terminating the pregnancy ('Yank the fetus'), dismissing potential alternatives like transplantation as 'fantasy' due to the high surgical risks involved even in termination. His focus is purely on the medical necessity and the patient's survival, treating the fetus as the source of the medical problem to be removed. The patient herself, upon learning of the pregnancy and its location, immediately consents to the removal ('Remove the fetus. Absolutely. Where do I sign?'), explicitly citing her demanding career, constant travel, and lack of a partner as reasons why she cannot support a child. This clearly aligns her personal circumstances and choice with the medically indicated course of action. Dr. Hadley (Thirteen) briefly introduces a counter-perspective, asking 'What if she wants to keep the baby?' and mentioning that 'Fetuses have been transplanted before,' suggesting a moment of consideration for the potential life or the patient's potential desire. However, this perspective is quickly shut down by House based on the extreme medical risks and the patientâ€™s subsequent unambiguous decision. The narrative does not delve deeply into the moral status of the fetus; the overwhelming focus is on the severe medical risk to the patient and her own clearly expressed wishes based on her life context. Therefore, the dominant position favors the termination of the pregnancy, primarily driven by medical necessity and strongly supported by the patient's autonomy and personal circumstances. Fetal considerations are acknowledged but do not override the decision given the specific, perilous context. This aligns most closely with a Moderately Pro-Choice stance.",
