    "detailed_evaluation": "The dialogues from the episode present a complex narrative concerning the theme of abortion, viewed primarily through the lens of a character contemplating the procedure. The character expresses a strong emotional conflict, revealing that she does not want to be a mother and ties this sentiment to her identity as a surgeon, emphasizing her career over motherhood. This internal struggle aligns more closely with a pro-choice perspective, as the character desires the autonomy to make decisions about her own body and future. The dialogue surrounding her decision is treated with gravity and urgency, indicating the importance of her choice. Overall, although there are moments of contemplating the implications of her decision, the dominant position leans towards validating her right to choose, reflecting a pro-choice stance, rather than a pro-life one. Given this context, the score is +2, indicating a strong pro-choice orientation.",
