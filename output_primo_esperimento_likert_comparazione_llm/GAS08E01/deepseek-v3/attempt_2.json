    "detailed_evaluation": "The episode's dialogues contain only a brief and ambiguous reference to abortion, which does not allow for a comprehensive evaluation of the dominant position on abortion within the text. The mention of abortion is not explored in depth, nor does it present a clear stance or argument from any character. Therefore, the text does not align strongly with any position on the abortion discourse scale.",
