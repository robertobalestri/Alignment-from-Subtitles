    "detailed_evaluation": "The episode's dialogues provide a complex look at various personal and professional challenges among the characters, but they do include direct reference to a planned abortion. A character expresses a clear desire not to become a mother, preferring her surgical career over having a child, highlighting her autonomy and decision-making in personal matters. While there are emotional complexities around this decision, the character is set on proceeding with the abortion. Another character is resistant to her decision but ultimately does not alter the course of action. This interaction leans towards a pro-choice perspective, as the episode gives significant weight to the character's personal choice and autonomy over her body, despite the potential relational conflict it causes. The lack of overriding fetal moral considerations, and the emphasis on individual choice and autonomy in this dialogue, suggests a stance that is more pro-choice.",
