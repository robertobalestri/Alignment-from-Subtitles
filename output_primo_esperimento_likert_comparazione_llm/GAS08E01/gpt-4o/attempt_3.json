    "detailed_evaluation": "The text contains a brief dialogue towards its end where a character mentions having an abortion. This suggests that there is some level of attention given to the individual's autonomy and choice regarding pregnancy. The conversation indicates that despite the character's emotional distress, her desire to remain in her surgical career strongly motivates her decision to proceed with the abortion. The dialogue does not delve deeply into the moral considerations regarding fetal life, focusing more on the individual's personal and professional conflicts. It is also evident that there is support from another character for this decision. However, the overarching narrative doesn't focus heavily on the broader socio-political debate of abortion rights but rather on personal context. Given these elements, the score is placed on the Moderately Pro-Choice side.",
