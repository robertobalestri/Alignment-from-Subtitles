    "detailed_evaluation": "The dialogue text primarily centers on a conversation between Dr. House and a patient who has been raped and discovers she is pregnant. The patient initially expresses a strong pro-life stance, stating 'Abortion is murder' and 'Every life is sacred.' This aligns with the -3 end of the scale. However, Dr. House actively challenges this viewpoint, arguing pragmatically and focusing entirely on the patient's extreme circumstances and well-being. He dismisses the 'sacred life' argument as a 'bumper sticker' and meaningless in the face of reality ('What about Hitler?', 'Father of your child, is his life sacred to you?'). He explicitly states that termination is the logical course ('It's a life, and... you should end it') and frames the patient's adherence to her belief as 'throwing your life away.' While House acknowledges her belief ('True. It's a life...'), his arguments consistently prioritize the patient's autonomy, future, and the devastating context of the pregnancy's origin (rape) over the moral status of the fetus. The conversation is structured as a debate where House attempts to dismantle the patient's absolute moral stance in favor of a practical, context-dependent decision focused on her welfare. Crucially, the narrative resolution reveals the patient 'terminated.' This outcome, coupled with the dominance of House's arguments prioritizing the patient's well-being and choice within the dialogue, indicates the text's dominant position leans strongly towards pro-choice, specifically validating abortion as a necessary option given the traumatic circumstances. Fetal considerations are voiced by the patient but are ultimately subordinated by House's arguments and the final reported action. The focus is squarely on the pregnant individual's dire situation and the legitimacy of her choice to terminate.",
