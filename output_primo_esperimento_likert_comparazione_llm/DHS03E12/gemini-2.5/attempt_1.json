    "detailed_evaluation": "The dialogue text presents a complex engagement with the theme of abortion, primarily centered around a patient who becomes pregnant as a result of rape. Initially, the patient expresses a strong pro-life stance, stating 'Abortion is murder' and 'Every life is sacred,' grounding her opposition in absolute moral terms. This aligns with the descriptions for scores -2 or -3 on the scale. However, the dominant interaction on the topic occurs between her and Dr. House. House directly challenges her absolute stance, arguing pragmatically and focusing on her specific traumatic circumstances and future well-being. He counters her 'every life is sacred' claim, points out the difficulty of drawing lines, and explicitly advises her to terminate ('It's a life, and... you should end it'). He frames her decision to keep the baby as 'throwing your life away' based on beliefs that don't 'make sense' in this context. While the patient's initial pro-life view is given significant weight and presented as a genuine moral conflict, the narrative momentum, driven by House's sustained arguments and perspective, leans towards contextual justification for abortion. Crucially, the episode concludes with the information that the patient 'terminated.' This outcome validates the arguments prioritizing the pregnant individual's autonomy and well-being within the specific, extreme context presented, even though the dialogue acknowledges the patient's conflicting moral beliefs about fetal life. The text does not present abortion as unequivocally right in all cases (+3) or strongly prioritize autonomy over fetal considerations universally (+2), but it heavily emphasizes the personal, emotional, and social factors influencing the decision in this difficult scenario, ultimately aligning with the patient choosing termination after extensive dialogue challenging her initial stance. Therefore, the dominant position within the text leans moderately towards pro-choice.",
