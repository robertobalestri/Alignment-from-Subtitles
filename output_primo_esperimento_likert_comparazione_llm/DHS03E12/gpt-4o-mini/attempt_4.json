    "detailed_evaluation": "The dialogues provided present a conflicted and complex discussion regarding abortion, primarily through the interaction between House and a patient who has been raped and is faced with the decision of whether to terminate the pregnancy. Throughout the conversation, the patient expresses her desire to keep the baby, stating, 'Abortion is murder,' and reflects on the sanctity of life, which points towards a pro-life stance. House, on the other hand, challenges her views by discussing the implications of the moral arguments surrounding pregnancy and termination, illustrating a more cynical and analytical perspective. The back-and-forth highlights a struggle between personal autonomy and moral dilemmas surrounding the unborn child's life. While there is a recognition of the complexity of the situation, and some context is given to the emotional toll it takes on the patient, the overall tone leans towards portraying abortion as a serious moral issue rather than an unequivocal right. Therefore, this text largely emphasizes the pro-life arguments while acknowledging the painful circumstances surrounding its discussion, thereby reflecting a stance that could be classified as 'Moderately Pro-Life' with a score of -1.",
