    "detailed_evaluation": "The provided dialogues from the Grey's Anatomy episode primarily address abortion through the storyline of Dr. Cristina Yang. Initially, Cristina is revealed to be pregnant and is seeking an abortion, indicated by her needing an emergency contact to confirm a 'clinic appointment' and her firm declaration to Meredith that the father, Dr. Burke, 'will never know' and 'it's over.' This setup frames the decision as a personal one, emphasizing Cristina's autonomy and privacy. The conversation between Meredith and Cristina focuses on practicalities (telling the father for financial reasons) rather than moral or ethical debates about the fetus's status. \n\nHowever, the narrative takes a turn when Cristina collapses due to a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. This is a life-threatening medical emergency where the pregnancy is non-viable and located outside the uterus (in the fallopian tube). The subsequent surgery, performed by Dr. Addison Shepherd, is medically necessary to save Cristina's life and results in the removal of the damaged tube and the termination of the pregnancy. \n\nTherefore, while Cristina *intended* to have an elective abortion, the actual termination depicted is a non-elective, emergency procedure required due to a specific, dangerous medical condition. The dialogues surrounding this event focus entirely on Cristina's health crisis, the surgical intervention, and her recovery. There is no discussion of the moral status of the fetus, nor are any pro-life viewpoints presented by any character. The dominant focus remains squarely on the pregnant individual's experience, bodily integrity, and survival. \n\nThe overall framing implicitly supports reproductive autonomy by presenting Cristina's initial intention without judgment and centering the narrative on her perspective. The resolution via medical necessity further underscores the importance of the pregnant person's life and well-being. The complete absence of debate regarding fetal rights or moral status, combined with the focus on Cristina's autonomy and health, places the dominant position strongly towards pro-choice.",
