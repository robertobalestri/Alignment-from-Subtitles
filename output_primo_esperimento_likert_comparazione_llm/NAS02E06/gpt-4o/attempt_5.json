    "detailed_evaluation": "The episode includes a scene where a young character, Chante, discovers she is pregnant and expresses a clear desire to have an abortion. Dr. Frome and Dr. Bloom support Chante's autonomy, advising her that she has the legal right to make the decision despite her legal guardian's wishes to the contrary. The conversation around Chante’s pregnancy focuses more on her personal choice and autonomy rather than the fetus’s moral or ethical value. There is acknowledgment of familial and social support, but her choice is foregrounded. The dialogue suggests a pro-choice stance, leaning towards supporting the individual's decision-making power regarding abortion when considering her personal circumstances. Other dialogues also show empathetic support towards individual autonomy, aligning with a moderately pro-choice perspective.",
