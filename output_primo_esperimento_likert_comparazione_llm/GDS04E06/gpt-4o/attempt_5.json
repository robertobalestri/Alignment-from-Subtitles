    "detailed_evaluation": "The episode of 'The Good Doctor' presents a complex and multi-layered view of abortion. Various characters express differing views, with one explicitly stating a religious objection to performing abortions. This character displays a struggle between personal beliefs and professional responsibilities, highlighting the tension between private morals and medical duties. Another character takes over the procedure due to the first character's reluctance and inexperience, indicating institutional prioritization of patient care over personal beliefs in urgent cases. Another character empathically reassures a patient seeking an abortion, supporting her decision and emphasizing the importance of personal choice. Overall, while the moral value of the fetus is acknowledged through a character's objection, the narrative gives more attention to the medical and personal autonomy aspects, ultimately supporting the pregnant individualâ€™s right to choose. This places the episode closer to a pro-choice stance.",
