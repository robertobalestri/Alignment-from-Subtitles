    "detailed_evaluation": "The episode features a range of perspectives on abortion, but the dominant narrative supports the pregnant individual's autonomy in making the decision. The characters engage in discussions that acknowledge the moral and emotional complexities of abortion, but ultimately, the text leans toward validating the individual's choice. Dr. Lim's insistence that residents must be trained to perform abortions, regardless of personal beliefs, underscores the institutional support for reproductive rights. Additionally, the portrayal of the patient's fear and the reassurance she receives from her doctors further emphasizes the pro-choice orientation of the text. While there are dissenting voices, such as the resident's religious objections, these are presented as individual conflicts rather than overarching moral imperatives.",
