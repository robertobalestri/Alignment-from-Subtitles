    "detailed_evaluation": "In this episode of 'The Good Doctor,' there are various perspectives surrounding the topic of abortion. One character, Jordan, expresses strong personal discomfort regarding performing an abortion due to her religious beliefs, indicating a pro-life stance. However, another character insists on the importance of teaching the procedure and respecting the patient's decision, which aligns more with a pro-choice viewpoint. The patient herself expresses a clear desire to have an abortion, emphasizing her autonomy and the emotional complexities surrounding her decision. Throughout the dialogues, while there is a recognition of both the moral and personal aspects of the situation, the dominant tone ultimately leans towards supporting the pregnant individual's choice over presenting strong pro-life arguments. This indicates a moderately pro-choice stance overall.",
