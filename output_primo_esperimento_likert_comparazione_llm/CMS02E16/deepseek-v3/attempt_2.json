    "detailed_evaluation": "The episode presents a complex and nuanced view on abortion, primarily through the case of Teresa Azen, a woman in a persistent vegetative state who is discovered to be pregnant due to sexual assault. Her parents decide to keep the pregnancy despite the high medical risks to Teresa, citing the baby as 'the only part we have left' of their daughter. The medical team, while acknowledging the parents' wishes, emphasizes the severe risks to Teresa's health and survival, suggesting termination as a medically advisable option. This scenario highlights the tension between pro-life and pro-choice perspectives, with the parents leaning towards a pro-life stance (valuing the potential life of the fetus) and the medical team advocating for a pro-choice consideration (prioritizing Teresa's health and well-being). The narrative does not definitively side with either perspective but presents both arguments with empathy and depth, acknowledging the emotional, ethical, and medical complexities involved. Other subplots in the episode, such as the struggles of other patients and their families, further underscore themes of autonomy, care, and difficult decisions in medical contexts, but the Teresa storyline is the most directly relevant to the abortion discourse. Overall, the episode maintains a balanced approach, giving weight to both the moral considerations of fetal life and the rights and health of the pregnant individual.",
