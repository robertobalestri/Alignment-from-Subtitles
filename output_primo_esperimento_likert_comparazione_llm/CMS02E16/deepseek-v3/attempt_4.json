    "detailed_evaluation": "The episode presents a complex and nuanced view on abortion, primarily through the storyline of Teresa Azen, a woman in a persistent vegetative state who is discovered to be pregnant due to sexual assault. Her parents decide to keep the pregnancy despite the high medical risks, emphasizing the baby as 'the only part we have left' of their daughter. This narrative leans towards a pro-life perspective, as it highlights the moral value of the fetus and the parents' emotional attachment to it, even in extreme circumstances. However, the medical professionals express concerns about the risks to Teresa's health, acknowledging the pregnant individual's well-being, which introduces some pro-choice considerations. The overall narrative, however, is dominated by the parents' decision to preserve the pregnancy, aligning more closely with a pro-life stance.",
