    "detailed_evaluation": "The episode presents a complex and nuanced view on abortion, primarily through the storyline of Teresa Azen, a woman in a persistent vegetative state who is discovered to be pregnant due to sexual assault. Her parents decide to keep the pregnancy despite the high medical risks, emphasizing the baby as 'the only part we have left' of their daughter. This narrative leans towards a pro-life perspective, as it highlights the moral and emotional value placed on the fetus, even in extremely difficult circumstances. However, the medical professionals express concerns about the risks to Teresa's health, introducing some pro-choice considerations regarding the pregnant individual's well-being. The overall narrative, however, is dominated by the parents' decision to prioritize the fetus's life, aligning more closely with a pro-life stance.",
