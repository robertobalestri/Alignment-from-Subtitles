    "detailed_evaluation": "The episode presents a complex scenario involving Teresa, a patient initially believed to be in a Persistent Vegetative State (PVS) who becomes pregnant due to rape. The core conflict surrounding abortion arises between Teresa's parents and Dr. Manning. The parents adopt a strong pro-life stance, wishing to keep the baby despite the rape, viewing the fetus as the 'only part' of their daughter they have left ('the baby's still part of Teresa. The only part we have left.'). The father even controversially suggests Teresa dying in childbirth might be a 'merciful outcome', heavily prioritizing the continuation of the pregnancy over Teresa's precarious health. This perspective emphasizes the value of the potential life, linking it directly to their daughter. Conversely, Dr. Manning initially presents termination as a straightforward option ('Fortunately, termination will be a painless procedure.') and strongly emphasizes the extreme medical risks Teresa would face carrying the pregnancy to term ('extremely high risks... there is a chance that she will not survive'), prioritizing the patient's physical well-being. She also questions whether Teresa would want the pregnancy given the rape ('do you believe that she would want to keep this pregnancy?'), focusing on bodily autonomy and context. The hospital administrator, Goodwin, acknowledges the ethical dilemma regarding Teresa's likely wishes but defers to the parents' legal guardianship initially ('Your wishes will be honored.'). The narrative does not definitively champion either side within the abortion debate itself. Instead, the plot's resolution hinges on discovering Teresa has locked-in syndrome and is conscious, shifting the focus towards enabling her to communicate her *own* decision via technology. Dr. Manning notes, 'Looks like you're gonna get your wish. She will have a say in her future.' While strong pro-life arguments (from the parents) and strong pro-choice considerations (from Dr. Manning, focusing on health risks and autonomy after rape) are both given significant weight and screen time, the dominant trajectory of the narrative is towards restoring the patient's agency to make her own choice, thereby validating the importance of individual autonomy in the decision. However, because it presents both the parents' desire to preserve potential life and the medical/autonomy concerns so forcefully without reaching a conclusion on the abortion itself, the text primarily functions as an exploration of the conflict's complexity rather than advocating a specific outcome. This positions it as Neutral/Balanced.",
