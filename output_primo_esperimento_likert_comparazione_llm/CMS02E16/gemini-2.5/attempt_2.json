    "detailed_evaluation": "The episode primarily centers on the case of Teresa Azen, a woman in a persistent vegetative state (later revealed to be locked-in syndrome) who is discovered to be pregnant as a result of rape. The core conflict regarding abortion arises between Teresa's parents and Dr. Manning.\n\nTeresa's parents explicitly state their desire to keep the baby, viewing it as 'part of Teresa' and 'the only part we have left,' despite the pregnancy resulting from rape and the significant medical risks Dr. Manning outlines (pulmonary embolism, sepsis, death). They even suggest that Teresa dying in childbirth might be a 'merciful outcome.' This represents a strong pro-life stance, prioritizing the continuation of the pregnancy even at the potential cost of Teresa's life and without her consent.\n\nDr. Manning, conversely, initially assumes termination would be the desired path given the circumstances and presents it as a 'painless procedure.' She strongly emphasizes the extreme medical risks to Teresa, advocating for the consideration of the pregnant individual's well-being. Her later focus shifts to Teresa's potential autonomy, wishing Teresa could 'have a say,' especially after suspecting and confirming Teresa is conscious (locked-in syndrome). This perspective aligns more with pro-choice principles, focusing on the pregnant person's health, safety, and bodily autonomy.\n\nNurse Maggie Lockwood also implicitly questions the parents' decision by noting Teresa's inability to consent ('When you can't talk, you don't get to say nothing').\n\nThe hospital administration, represented by Ms. Goodwin, ultimately respects the parents' decision as legal guardians, highlighting the legal framework but not taking an ethical stance itself.\n\nThe dominant position *driving the plot's conflict* is the parents' decision to continue the pregnancy. Their emotionally charged, pro-life reasoning is clearly articulated and forms the basis of the ethical dilemma presented. However, the narrative gives significant weight to Dr. Manning's counterarguments focusing on medical risk and patient autonomy. The eventual revelation of Teresa's consciousness serves to underscore the importance of her own voice, implicitly validating the pro-choice emphasis on individual autonomy. \n\nConsidering the scale, the parents' view leans towards -2 or -3. Dr. Manning's view leans towards +1 or +2. The text presents both but the *action* taken (honoring the parents' wish initially) and the *catalyst* for the conflict stems from the parents' pro-life stance. The narrative doesn't fully endorse this, heavily featuring the risks and ethical issues raised by Dr. Manning. Therefore, the text emphasizes the fetus's value (through the parents) but devotes significant attention to the individual's extreme medical considerations and potential lack of autonomy (through Dr. Manning). Exceptions (like risk to life) are presented as ethically burdensome but are initially overridden by the guardians' decision. This complexity places the dominant discourse driving the conflict at 'Moderately Pro-Life' within the text's presented scenario, as the pro-life decision holds sway until the plot twist, despite strong counter-narratives.",
