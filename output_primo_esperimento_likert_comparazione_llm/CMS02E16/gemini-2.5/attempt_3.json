    "detailed_evaluation": "The episode centers on a deeply complex ethical dilemma: the pregnancy of Teresa, a woman in a persistent vegetative state (later revealed to be locked-in syndrome) resulting from rape. The primary conflict arises between the parents, who wish to keep the baby, viewing it as the only part of Teresa they have left, and Dr. Manning, who highlights the extreme medical risks to Teresa and questions whether Teresa herself would want to continue the pregnancy given the circumstances of its conception. \n\nThe parents' stance is strongly pro-life, bordering on -3 initially, as they prioritize the fetus's connection to Teresa even over Teresa's potential survival, suggesting her death in childbirth might be 'merciful'. They see the fetus as intrinsically valuable because it is 'part of Teresa'.\n\nHowever, Dr. Manning consistently raises points aligned with a pro-choice perspective, focusing on Teresa's medical well-being (+1/+2 concerns) and crucially, her potential autonomy and wishes, asking if Teresa would want this given the abuse (+2 concern). The narrative doesn't dismiss the parents' grief or their view of the fetus, legally honoring their guardianship initially. \n\nYet, the medical risks are heavily emphasized, and the ethical weight of forcing a rape victim (even one presumed unconscious) to carry a high-risk pregnancy is palpable. The discovery that Teresa is conscious (locked-in) dramatically shifts the focus. The resolution isn't the termination itself, but the eventual possibility for Teresa to communicate her *own* decision. This outcome implicitly validates the principle of bodily autonomy and the pregnant individual's right to choose, even if that choice isn't made within the episode's timeframe. \n\nThe dominant position isn't a strong advocacy for abortion per se, but rather a critical examination of an imposed pro-life decision under horrific circumstances, ultimately leaning towards the primacy of the pregnant person's context, health, and eventual agency. It acknowledges the fetus's value *to the parents* but foregrounds the devastating situation and medical risks for the mother, culminating in the restoration of her potential voice. Therefore, the narrative leans moderately towards prioritizing the individual's circumstances and autonomy.",
