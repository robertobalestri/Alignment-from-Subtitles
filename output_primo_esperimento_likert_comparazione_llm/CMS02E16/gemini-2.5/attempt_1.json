    "detailed_evaluation": "The dialogue presents a complex and emotionally charged scenario involving abortion centered around Teresa, a woman in a presumed persistent vegetative state (PVS) who was raped and became pregnant. Initially, Dr. Manning suggests termination as a straightforward procedure, reflecting a perspective where context (rape, PVS) justifies abortion (+1/+2 leaning). However, Teresa's parents strongly oppose this, expressing a pro-life stance rooted in viewing the fetus as the 'only part of Teresa' they have left, even acknowledging the horrific circumstances of conception and the severe risks to Teresa's life. Their willingness to potentially sacrifice Teresa's life for the fetus ('If she dies giving birth, maybe that's a merciful outcome') represents an extreme pro-life viewpoint (approaching -3 for their specific stance). The medical staff (Dr. Manning, Goodwin) consistently raise concerns about the high medical risks to Teresa and implicitly question the ethics of forcing the pregnancy, bringing in elements of maternal health and autonomy (+1). The narrative takes a significant turn upon discovering Teresa is conscious (Locked-In Syndrome). This revelation shifts the focus dramatically towards her potential agency. Dr. Manning's comment, 'Looks like you're gonna get your wish. She will have a say in her future,' underscores the paramount importance of Teresa's own decision-making capacity, now that it's potentially restorable. While the parents' strong pro-life arguments are given significant weight and drive the conflict for much of the plot, the narrative resolution firmly centers on the pregnant individual's potential autonomy. The text doesn't dismiss the moral value placed on the fetus by the parents but ultimately validates the importance of the pregnant person's choice, especially given the extreme medical risks and traumatic circumstances. The ending emphasizes personal autonomy and contextual factors over the absolute moral status of the fetus, aligning the dominant narrative position with a moderately pro-choice stance.",
