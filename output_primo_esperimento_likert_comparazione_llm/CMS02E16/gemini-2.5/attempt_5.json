    "detailed_evaluation": "The episode introduces the theme of abortion through the character Teresa Azen, who is initially believed to be in a persistent vegetative state and is discovered to be pregnant as a result of rape. The initial conflict arises between Dr. Manning, who implicitly suggests termination as a practical and perhaps compassionate option given the circumstances and medical risks, and Teresa's parents, who adamantly wish to keep the baby, viewing it as the only remaining part of their daughter. The parents' position represents a strong pro-life stance (-2 to -3), driven by grief and overriding concerns about the horrific circumstances of conception and significant medical risks to Teresa outlined by Dr. Manning. Dr. Manning's arguments focus on the extreme medical dangers to Teresa (+1) and question whether Teresa herself would want to continue the pregnancy given the rape, highlighting the importance of bodily autonomy (+2). Nurse Maggie implicitly supports Dr. Manning's concerns (+1). The narrative dramatically shifts with the discovery that Teresa is not vegetative but has locked-in syndrome, meaning she is conscious. This revelation reframes the entire ethical dilemma. The final relevant dialogue explicitly states that Teresa 'will have a say in her future.' This narrative turn decisively pivots the focus from the parents' wishes (pro-life) to Teresa's own agency and autonomy (pro-choice principle). While the parents' pro-life viewpoint is strongly voiced and drives the initial plot, the narrative resolution strongly validates the principle that the pregnant individual's choice is paramount, especially once her consciousness and potential ability to communicate are established. The text doesn't show the final decision but frames the restoration of Teresa's agency as the key ethical factor, subordinating the parents' earlier decision. Therefore, the dominant position conveyed by the narrative structure and resolution aligns with strongly valuing the individual's autonomy.",
