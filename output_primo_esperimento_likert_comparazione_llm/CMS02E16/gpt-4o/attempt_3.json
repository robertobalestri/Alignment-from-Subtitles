    "detailed_evaluation": "The episode addresses abortion primarily through the subplot involving Teresa, a woman in a persistent vegetative state who is found to be pregnant as a result of sexual assault. The discussions regarding abortion occur mainly between medical professionals and Teresa's parents. Initially, there's an assumption by Dr. Manning that termination is the likely choice given Teresa's condition and the circumstances of the pregnancy. However, Teresa's parents express a desire to keep the baby despite knowing that it resulted from rape, showing they place significant value on fetal life and its connection to their daughter. The medical staff presents high medical risks associated with carrying the pregnancy to term, but the parents are willing to accept these risks, which underscores their strong pro-life stance. Despite the logical and emotional arguments for termination (medical risks to Teresa and the fetus being a product of assault), the parents' decision to proceed with the pregnancy highlights a dominant pro-life position with ethical implications centered around the unborn child and its connection to Teresa. However, with the revelation of Teresa's awareness (locked-in syndrome), the situation adds complexity, as Teresa may potentially express her own wishes, which adds a layer to the discourse about bodily autonomy and consent, although it remains undeveloped within the episode. Overall, while the episode incorporates multiple perspectives, the prevailing sentiment aligns closely with a pro-life stance, valuing the fetus's connection to Teresa despite acknowledging emotional and medical factors.",
