    "detailed_evaluation": "The episode touches on the theme of abortion primarily through the subplot involving Teresa, a woman in a persistent vegetative state who was impregnated as a result of sexual assault. Her parents express a wish to keep the baby, viewing it as the only part of their daughter they have left. The medical professionals, however, provide a strong argument against continuing the pregnancy, citing high medical risks and the ethical dilemma regarding Teresa's lack of consent. While Teresa's parents want to keep the fetus, the medical staff articulate the dangers and ethical concerns of proceeding with the pregnancy in her condition. The episode showcases a spectrum of views but ultimately leans towards respecting individual autonomy and the complexities of the situation, noting the medical risks and lack of consent from Teresa, which puts more weight on the pro-choice arguments. However, it does not dismiss the emotional and familial motivations of the parents.",
