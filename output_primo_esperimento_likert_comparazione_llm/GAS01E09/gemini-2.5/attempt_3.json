    "detailed_evaluation": "The episode presents two significant plotlines involving pregnancy and potential termination, offering different perspectives and contexts. \n1. Cristina Yang actively seeks an abortion ('termination'). Her approach is pragmatic and focused on her own life, career ('light rotation', rearranging schedule), and autonomy ('I'm not interested' in talking). The narrative presents her decision straightforwardly, without imposing external moral judgment or significant internal conflict upon her. While a scheduler mentions alternatives like adoption, this is presented briefly as standard options rather than a forceful pro-life argument. Cristina's determination and focus on her choice dominate her narrative arc regarding this issue.\n2. Mrs. Glass, a 47-year-old woman with advanced cancer discovered during pregnancy, faces a stark choice: terminate the pregnancy ('evacuate the fetus') to undergo life-saving cancer treatment, or forgo treatment and keep the baby. Initially, the decision is made to terminate for medical reasons. However, Mrs. Glass ultimately changes her mind, deciding to keep the baby, framing it as her way of 'living' and finding meaning despite her grim prognosis. The narrative presents her reasoning with empathy and respects her autonomy in making this choice, even though it goes against medical advice aimed at her own survival. Cristina, representing a more pragmatic/medical viewpoint, struggles to understand this decision.\n\nOverall Assessment: The text does not present a single, unified stance. It avoids overt moralizing from a narrative perspective. Cristina's storyline clearly aligns with a pro-choice framework, emphasizing bodily autonomy and personal life circumstances without requiring justification. Mrs. Glass's storyline presents a complex ethical dilemma where abortion is medically indicated but ultimately rejected by the patient exercising her autonomy. While this results in a 'pro-life' outcome for the fetus, it's framed through the lens of the mother's personal choice and acceptance of her own mortality, rather than an overriding moral imperative about fetal rights imposed by the text. The dominant theme across both narratives is the individual's right to choose based on their complex personal, medical, and emotional circumstances. Because the narrative validates Cristina's straightforward choice for abortion and frames Mrs. Glass's choice against it primarily as an act of personal agency in a tragic situation, the overall leaning slightly favors the pro-choice emphasis on individual autonomy over external moral imperatives. It acknowledges the gravity and complexity (especially in Mrs. Glass's case) but leans towards validating the individual's decision-making authority.",
