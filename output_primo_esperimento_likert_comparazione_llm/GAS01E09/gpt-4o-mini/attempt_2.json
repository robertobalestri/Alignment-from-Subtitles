    "detailed_evaluation": "The dialogues present a complex situation involving the decision about pregnancy and cancer treatment. A character is faced with the reality of having cancer while being pregnant, and they are considering the implications of their decision on both their own life and the life of the fetus. The character's strong insistence on keeping the baby despite having cancer, coupled with a rejection of medical advice that suggests terminating the pregnancy for their health, shows a fundamentally pro-life stance. However, the dialogue does acknowledge the difficulties of that decision, hinting at the emotional turmoil involved. Still, the dominant position within the text argues in favor of preserving potential life and portrays abortion as an undesirable option when faced with alternative methods like treatment postponement. Therefore, the overall evaluation suggests a score leaning towards pro-life, particularly emphasizing the moral weight placed on the fetus's existence over the individual's health considerations.",
