    "detailed_evaluation": "Throughout the episode, multiple positions on abortion are represented. Initially, there is a proposal of alternative options to abortion, such as keeping the baby or adoption, suggesting a more pro-life stance. However, the dialogue focuses heavily on personal autonomy, as seen in the character who insists on scheduling the termination procedure, despite acknowledgment of its difficulty. Another narrative involves a character with breast cancer who is advised that treatment will not allow the baby to survive, highlighting a life-and-death scenario that the character ultimately decides against medical advice to prioritize the baby, representing a potential pro-life decision. Yet, significant screen time and importance are given to her autonomy, with her choice respected in the narrative. Overall, the text highlights the complexity and individual agency in such decisions rather than framing one side as overwhelmingly correct. Therefore, the dominant position leans towards supporting personal choice while acknowledging other factors, placing the episode in a moderately pro-choice perspective.",
