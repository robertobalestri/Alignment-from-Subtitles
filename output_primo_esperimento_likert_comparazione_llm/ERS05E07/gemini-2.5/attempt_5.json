    "detailed_evaluation": "The episode presents a specific, emotionally charged scenario involving abortion rather than a broad debate. The central conflict regarding abortion occurs when Carol Hathaway discovers a patient, Maria Jones, may have faked severe pain to get an ultrasound, potentially to determine the fetus's sex before deciding whether to abort, having had two previous abortions after two live births (boys). Carol reacts with intense moral outrage, confronting Maria physically and verbally ('She's had two boys and two abortions. Are you getting rid of this child...?'). Maria defends her autonomy ('It's my baby and I'll do what I want'). Dr. Greene intervenes, telling Carol to let Maria go, upholding Maria's autonomy to leave but not validating her potential reasons. The narrative focus is heavily on Carol's visceral negative reaction and the ethically questionable context (potential gender selection, deception) surrounding Maria's potential choice. While Maria's right to choose is ultimately not physically impeded, the emotional weight and framing of the scene strongly highlight the perceived moral wrongness of *this specific* potential abortion, emphasizing the value of the fetus over the patient's stated (and potentially frivolous) reasons. Carol's own concurrent infertility struggles implicitly add weight to her perspective within the narrative. This focus on the disturbing context of the choice and the strong negative emotional reaction from a main character, while acknowledging the patient's autonomy exists, aligns the dominant position more closely with a moderately pro-life perspective.",
