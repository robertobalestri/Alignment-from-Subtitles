    "detailed_evaluation": "The episode predominantly addresses abortion through a single, specific, and ethically charged storyline involving the character Maria Jones. Maria fakes symptoms of a potential ectopic pregnancy to obtain an ultrasound, seemingly to determine the sex of the fetus, having previously had two boys and two abortions. When confronted by Carol Hathaway, Maria asserts her autonomy ('It's my baby and I'll do what I want'), implying she may abort based on the sex, especially after remarking 'Girls are trouble anyhow' upon learning it might be a girl. Carol's reaction is visceral and condemnatory; she physically confronts Maria, questions her decision ('Are you getting rid of this child...?'), and expresses outrage after Maria leaves ('What's the matter with you?!'). \n\nThe narrative frames this specific instance of abortion consideration—sex selection achieved through deception—in a strongly negative light. While Maria voices a pro-choice stance ('I'll do what I want'), her manipulative actions and seemingly callous motivation undermine this perspective within the story's context. Carol's emotional outburst dominates the scene, emphasizing the perceived moral wrongness of Maria's potential decision and actions, highlighting the value of the potential life in contrast to the reason for considering termination. The episode doesn't engage in a broad debate on abortion rights or fetal moral status in general, but focuses narrowly on this problematic scenario. The dominant position presented through Carol's reaction and the negative portrayal of Maria's choices leans towards a condemnation of *this specific* use of abortion, emphasizing the moral burden and ethical dubiousness of the choice under these circumstances, rather than supporting the individual's autonomy in this case. This aligns most closely with a moderately pro-life stance, where certain contexts make the choice ethically questionable or unacceptable, and the individual's reasons are scrutinized negatively.",
