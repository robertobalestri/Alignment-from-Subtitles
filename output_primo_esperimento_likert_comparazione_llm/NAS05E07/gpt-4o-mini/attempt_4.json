    "detailed_evaluation": "The dialogues in this episode of 'New Amsterdam' present a complex interplay of perspectives surrounding abortion, ultimately leaning towards a pro-choice stance. Characters articulate both the emotional ramifications of pregnancy and the serious health risks posed by maintaining a pregnancy in the case of medical emergencies like cancer. The text acknowledges the societal and personal choices surrounding abortion, emphasizing autonomy and the right to choose. This is particularly evident in statements advocating for choice and the necessity of abortion in certain medical contexts. While there are pro-life sentiments expressed through individual characters, the overarching narrative strongly supports reproductive rights and the concept of choice as fundamental. This indicates a significant focus on individuals' rights, particularly in the context of medical considerations, personal beliefs, and women's health. Therefore, the evaluation aligns the text closely with a pro-choice stance.",
