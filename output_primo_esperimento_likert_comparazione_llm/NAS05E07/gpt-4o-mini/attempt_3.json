    "detailed_evaluation": "The episode 'Maybe Tomorrow' of *New Amsterdam* presents a multifaceted discussion about abortion, reflecting a range of perspectives. Characters express deep concerns about the implications of the Supreme Court's decision on abortion rights, emphasizing both the emotional turmoil of individuals facing unwanted pregnancies and the ethical dilemmas involved. There are moments where abortion is framed as a medical necessity under dire conditions, such as when a patient with cervical cancer is told that chemotherapy will terminate her pregnancy. The episode includes dialogues that suggest abortion can be a responsible choice made by individuals in complex situations. Specifically, a character recounts personal experiences with abortion, emphasizing autonomy and the importance of choice regardless of circumstances. Additionally, there are strong affirmations of the right to choose, particularly with plans for underground clinics to provide reproductive health services. Health care professionals firmly stand against societal and legal restrictions, advocating for patient rights and autonomy. While some characters express the emotional implications of abortion on relationships, the overarching narrative maintains a pro-choice perspective, focusing on individual rights and medical choices rather than solely moral arguments regarding the fetus. Thus, the dominant position within this text decidedly aligns towards a 'Strongly Pro-Choice' viewpoint.",
