    "detailed_evaluation": "The dialogues from this episode of 'New Amsterdam' present a complex discussion surrounding the theme of abortion, showcasing a spectrum of viewpoints. Key moments include characters expressing strong frustrations over the Supreme Court's ruling affecting women's rights, illustrating the perspective that abortion is a necessary medical procedure and a fundamental right. For instance, Dr. Wilder discusses a patient's life-threatening cancer diagnosis and the imperative of making a decision about her pregnancy, emphasizing the complexities of choice under dire circumstances. Other characters confront the moral and ethical implications head-on, suggesting that personal autonomy should govern medical decisions. Importantly, the narrative champions the idea that individuals should have the unfettered right to choose an abortion, framing it within the context of individual rights and dignity. Given this strong advocacy and the repeated affirmations about the importance of choice—especially amid oppressive legal and societal contexts—the overall position is decidedly pro-choice.",
