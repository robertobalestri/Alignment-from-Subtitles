    "detailed_evaluation": "The episode engages directly and extensively with the theme of abortion, triggered by the explicit mention of the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The narrative predominantly frames this event negatively, with main characters expressing shock and a desire to 'fix' the situation. Multiple plotlines reinforce a pro-choice perspective:\n\n1.  **Max Goodwin's Actions:** Max spends the episode actively trying to circumvent abortion bans, seeking ways to provide access through federal land loopholes, a floating clinic, and even suggesting an illegal underground clinic. His dialogue and actions consistently prioritize access to abortion as a necessary response to the ruling, highlighting the dangers faced by women (e.g., ectopic pregnancies, lack of resources).\n2.  **Lauren Bloom's Narrative:** Lauren shares her personal history of two abortions, one following a sexual assault and another due to personal circumstances and relationship dynamics. She strongly defends the right to choose for any reason ('simply because you are pregnant and you don't want to be'), framing it as a fundamental aspect of autonomy and responsibility. Her conflict with Floyd Reynolds further emphasizes the woman's perspective and criticizes male centering in abortion discussions.\n3.  **Michelle's Medical Case:** While presenting a character with strong pro-life beliefs facing a life-threatening cancer requiring abortion, the narrative ultimately frames her refusal as tragic and driven by 'politics' rather than purely medical necessity. Dr. Wilder, representing the medical establishment within the show, recommends abortion, attempts an alternative surgery out of respect for Michelle's wishes but ultimately returns to the abortion recommendation as the life-saving measure. Wilder explicitly states her own core belief is the 'right to choose,' and Michelle's potential death is portrayed as a consequence of her stance.\n4.  **Supporting Characters:** Karen Brantley's story about a dangerous pre-Roe illegal abortion underscores the negative consequences of restricted access. Iggy Frome's confrontation with an aggressive anti-abortion protester validates standing up against harassment and defending bodily autonomy rights.\n\nOverall, the episode consistently portrays the need for abortion access, validates the reasons women seek abortions, and frames opposition negativelyâ€”either as aggressive harassment (protester), politically driven tragedy (Michelle), or a dangerous historical reality (Karen's friend). The overwhelming narrative weight, character focus, and emotional appeals support the pregnant individual's autonomy and the framing of abortion as a right and necessary healthcare. Fetal moral status, while acknowledged through Michelle's perspective, is consistently subordinated to the pregnant individual's life, health, and autonomy within the episode's dominant ethical and narrative framework.",
