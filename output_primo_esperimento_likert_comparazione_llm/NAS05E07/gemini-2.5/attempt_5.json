    "detailed_evaluation": "The episode is explicitly set on the day the Roe v. Wade decision is overturned, immediately establishing a context of crisis and loss of rights from the perspective of the hospital staff. The dominant narrative strongly aligns with a pro-choice stance.\n\nMultiple plotlines reinforce this: \n1. Max Goodwin actively seeks ways to counteract the ruling, attempting to establish abortion services on federal land, via a floating clinic, and even suggesting an illegal underground clinic. His motivation is framed as protecting rights and providing essential care.\n2. Dr. Lauren Bloom reveals her past abortions, justifying them based on her circumstances (addiction, relationship status) and later explicitly stating that abortion should be available 'simply because you are pregnant and you don't want to be,' defining it as the essence of choice.\n3. Dr. Wilder faces a patient, Michelle, who refuses a medically necessary abortion for cancer treatment due to her pro-life beliefs, which she equates with her core identity. While Wilder respects Michelle's autonomy ('I listen to what they need'), the narrative frames Michelle's choice as tragic and life-threatening, ultimately stating 'Politics are' killing her, not the cancer. This presents the pro-life stance, through this character, as leading to a negative outcome.\n4. Dr. Iggy Frome confronts an aggressive anti-abortion protestor, initially apologizing for punching him under duress but later feeling pride in standing up for the patient's rights and against the protestor's harassment. His internal conflict and final stance reinforce the idea that protecting access is a moral imperative.\n5. Karen Brantley shares a personal story about her friend's dangerous illegal abortion pre-Roe, highlighting the negative consequences of abortion bans.\n\nThe dialogue frequently uses terms like 'rights,' 'autonomy,' 'choice,' and frames the overturning of Roe v. Wade as forcing doctors and patients into impossible situations ('forced birth,' 'logistical nightmare,' 'massive security risk'). While Michelle's pro-life perspective is presented as a deeply held belief, it is depicted as being in direct conflict with her survival, and the narrative empathy lies more with the doctors trying to provide care and the individuals seeking abortions. The fetus's moral status is central only to Michelle's viewpoint; for most other characters and the overarching plot, the pregnant person's health, rights, autonomy, and circumstances take precedence. The overall tone is one of advocating for abortion access and viewing restrictions as harmful.",
