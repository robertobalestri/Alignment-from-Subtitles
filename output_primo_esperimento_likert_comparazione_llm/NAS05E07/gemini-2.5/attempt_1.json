    "detailed_evaluation": "The episode, set on the day Roe v. Wade is overturned, overwhelmingly frames the issue from a pro-choice perspective. The narrative presents the Supreme Court ruling as a crisis, prompting the main characters (Max, Karen, Wilder, Lauren, Iggy) to react with urgency and dismay, seeking ways to preserve abortion access. \n\nMultiple pro-choice arguments are highlighted:\n1.  **Bodily Autonomy:** Lauren Bloom forcefully articulates this, sharing her own abortion experiences (due to rape, addiction, and personal choice) and stating abortion should be available simply because someone doesn't want to be pregnant. Dr. Wilder ultimately identifies 'the right to choose' as her own core belief.\n2.  **Medical Necessity & Safety:** The dangers of restricted access are shown through Max's calls to clinics (untreated ectopic pregnancies, legal threats), Karen Brantley's harrowing story of a dangerous pre-Roe illegal abortion, and Dr. Wilder's initial recommendation for Michelle to have an abortion to survive cancer.\n3.  **Negative Consequences of Bans:** The episode portrays the immediate negative impact on healthcare providers and patients in affected states. Michelle's storyline, while respecting her pro-life conviction, culminates in a tragic outcome attributed by Dr. Wilder not just to cancer, but to 'politics' preventing life-saving care.\n4.  **Social Justice & Broader Rights:** The episode mentions the disproportionate impact on certain communities and links the abortion ruling to potential threats against other rights, such as gay marriage (via Iggy and Martin's conversation).\n\nThe primary pro-life viewpoint is embodied by Michelle, the pregnant patient with cancer. Her stance is presented as a deeply held core belief ('These are my beliefs, my core, my values'), equating abortion with murder, even at the cost of her own life. Dr. Wilder respects Michelle's autonomy by attempting a risky alternative surgery. However, the narrative frames Michelle's ultimate refusal of life-saving chemo and impending death as a tragedy directly resulting from her beliefs within the new legal context. Anti-abortion protestors are depicted negatively as aggressive harassers. Floyd Reynolds introduces a brief conflict regarding a partner's feelings/right to know but ultimately seems to accept Lauren's stance on autonomy.\n\nOverall, while acknowledging the existence and depth of pro-life beliefs through Michelle, the episode's narrative drive, character motivations, plot resolutions (or lack thereof, highlighting tragedy), and emotional weight strongly advocate for abortion access as a necessary right and frame its restriction as dangerous and morally problematic. The protagonists are clearly aligned with ensuring access, and their efforts dominate the episode's focus.",
