    "detailed_evaluation": "This episode of 'New Amsterdam' strongly leans towards a pro-choice perspective, illustrating the challenges faced by individuals seeking abortions post the overturn of Roe v. Wade. Several characters express frustration and dismay over the Supreme Court's decision, aiming to find ways to provide abortion services despite legal restrictions. The episode highlights personal autonomy and the right to choose, as seen in the character's emphasis on reproductive freedom, and recounts personal experiences with abortion that underline its significance as a choice. Some characters express their beliefs strongly, in opposition to the legal restrictions, further reinforcing the storyline's overall pro-choice stance. Conversely, the pro-life viewpoint is minimally recognized and portrayed as a barrier to necessary medical interventions. This depiction subordinates the moral worth of the fetus to the autonomy and rights of the individual. The overarching narrative is one of resistance against the Supreme Court's ruling, and a determination to preserve the right to abortion as a fundamental aspect of reproductive rights.",
