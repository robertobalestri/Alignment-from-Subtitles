    "detailed_evaluation": "The episode 'Maybe Tomorrow' from *New Amsterdam* Season 05, Episode 07, primarily focuses on the repercussions following the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The dialogues reflect a strong pro-choice stance. Characters express significant concern over the rights lost due to the ruling, and the storyline includes attempts to counteract its effects, such as the idea of providing abortion services on federal land or through underground clinics. The plight of one patient, Michelle, highlights the conflict between personal beliefs against abortion and severe medical need, presenting an ethical dilemma. However, the narrative strongly emphasizes individuals' autonomy and the moral imperative to support reproductive freedom, framing the curtailment of these rights as an injustice. While there are some acknowledgements of differing beliefs, the episode prominently advocates for the right to choose, making this the dominant position.",
