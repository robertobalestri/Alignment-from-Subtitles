    "detailed_evaluation": "The episode presents a complex and multifaceted view on abortion, with characters expressing a range of opinions and emotions. The dominant position, however, leans strongly towards pro-choice, as evidenced by the following key points: 1) The narrative strongly critiques the overturning of Roe v. Wade, framing it as a loss of rights and a dangerous precedent. 2) Characters like Dr. Wilder and Dr. Goodwin advocate for abortion access, emphasizing the importance of individual choice and the medical necessity of abortion in certain cases. 3) The episode highlights the real-world consequences of abortion bans, such as the inability to treat ectopic pregnancies or life-threatening conditions. 4) Personal stories, like Kisha's, are used to humanize the pro-choice stance, emphasizing the importance of safe and accessible abortion services. 5) The episode also critiques the pro-life position, particularly through the confrontation with the protestor, who is portrayed as antagonistic and unreasonable. While the episode does include a character (Michelle) who is personally opposed to abortion, her stance is presented as a personal belief rather than a normative position, and the narrative ultimately underscores the importance of choice, even in her case. The overall tone and messaging of the episode align most closely with the 'Strongly Pro-Choice' (+2) category on the scale.",
