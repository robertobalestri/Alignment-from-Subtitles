    "detailed_evaluation": "The episode presents a complex and multifaceted view on abortion, with characters expressing a range of opinions and emotions. The dominant position, however, leans strongly towards pro-choice, as evidenced by the portrayal of the challenges and dangers faced by individuals seeking abortions, the emotional and medical justifications for the procedure, and the critique of the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. The narrative emphasizes the importance of individual autonomy, the right to choose, and the medical necessity of abortion in certain cases. While there are characters who oppose abortion on moral or political grounds, their perspectives are often challenged or portrayed as obstacles to the well-being and rights of others. The episode also highlights the societal and personal consequences of restricting access to abortion, reinforcing the pro-choice stance.",
