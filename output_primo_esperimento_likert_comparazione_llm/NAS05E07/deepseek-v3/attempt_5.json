    "detailed_evaluation": "The episode presents a complex and multifaceted view on abortion, with characters expressing a range of opinions and emotions. The dominant position, however, leans strongly towards pro-choice, as evidenced by the portrayal of the challenges and dangers faced by individuals seeking abortions, the emotional and ethical dilemmas of medical professionals, and the explicit advocacy for reproductive rights. The narrative emphasizes the importance of individual autonomy, the right to choose, and the societal and personal consequences of restricting abortion access. While there are moments where pro-life perspectives are presented (e.g., Michelle's refusal to abort due to her beliefs), these are framed within the broader context of the episode's pro-choice stance, which is reinforced by the characters' actions and the overall narrative arc.",
