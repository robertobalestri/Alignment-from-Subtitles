    "detailed_evaluation": "The dialogue excerpts provided contain a significant subplot involving Dr. Cristina Yang discovering she is pregnant. Her immediate reaction and subsequent conversations with Meredith Grey focus entirely on the negative impact the pregnancy would have on her surgical career ('You know what happens to pregnant interns. I'm not switching to the vagina squad... Surgery's my life.'). The narrative frames her consideration of abortion primarily through the lens of professional ambition and personal autonomy. When Cristina later asks Meredith to be her 'emergency contact person' for a clinic appointment, implying she has decided to terminate the pregnancy, Meredith accepts this role without expressing judgment or presenting alternative viewpoints. There are no characters or dialogue lines within this text that articulate a 'pro-life' stance, argue for the moral status of the fetus, or question Cristina's implied decision on ethical grounds related to fetal life. The focus remains consistently on the pregnant individual's circumstances, choices, and the perceived necessity of abortion to maintain her life path and career. This framing strongly subordinates fetal considerations to the pregnant person's autonomy and well-being.",
