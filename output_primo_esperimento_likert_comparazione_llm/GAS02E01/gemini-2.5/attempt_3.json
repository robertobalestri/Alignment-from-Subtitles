    "detailed_evaluation": "The theme of abortion is introduced through the character Cristina Yang, who reveals she is pregnant. Her immediate reaction and subsequent dialogue focus entirely on the potential negative impact on her surgical career ('Look, you know what happens to pregnant interns... I'm not switching to the vagina squad... I'm too talented. Surgery's my life.'). The narrative frames the pregnancy primarily as an obstacle to her personal and professional goals. There is no discussion presented from any character regarding the moral status of the fetus, the sanctity of potential life, or any ethical arguments against abortion. The dialogue centers on Cristina's perspective, her autonomy, and her internal conflict (though she keeps much of it private). The episode culminates with Cristina informing Meredith that she has scheduled an appointment at a clinic (strongly implying an abortion) and has designated Meredith as her required emergency contact person ('You're my \"person.\"'). This act portrays the decision to terminate the pregnancy as a practical step taken by Cristina based on her life circumstances and priorities. The dominant position within the text strongly foregrounds the pregnant individual's autonomy, career considerations, and personal choice, with fetal considerations being entirely absent from the discourse. This aligns with a 'Strongly Pro-Choice' stance, where abortion is presented as a legitimate exercise of reproductive freedom based on the individual's well-being and life context.",
