was try to live a normal life,

when he takes the stand,

56
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,041
maybe he won't blame Pete

I wouldn't have said
I was coming if I wasn't.

I actually keep my word.

71
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:09,125
I-I didn't know
you were married.

72
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:10,291
I'm not.

73
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,667

00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:30,166
Deb, I know you think, uh...

77
00:03:32,792 --> 00:03:34,959
There's lots to say.

78
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
But I'm sober now six months,

79
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,125

that this is not easy, okay?

81
00:03:42,834 --> 00:03:45,041
But I need for us--
I need--

82
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,667
you need?

83
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:49,500
I needed to go to
my third grade dance recital

84
00:03:49,542 --> 00:03:51,834
instead of sitting in a bar,
eating pretzels.

85
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:54,458
I needed to not walk around
on eggshells all the time

86
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,083
because mom and I never knew

87
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:58,250
which version of you
we were gonna get.

88
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:00,458
That must have been very hard
for you.
Yeah, you know,
that wasn't the hard part.

89
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,041
Getting a job at 17 to support
us because he just left--

90
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,667
that was hard.

91
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:06,875
You told me to go.

92
00:04:06,917 --> 00:04:08,709
I was a 17-year-old kid.

93
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,375
Your kid. You're the father.

94
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,667
Ed, do you have any regrets
about those days?

95
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:15,083
Oh, of course.

96
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,834
But I thought
it would be better for her--
to have no parents?

97
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:18,917
Your mother was there.

98
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,417
No. After you left,
she just sat there

99
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:24,709
and stared out a window,
broken.

100
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,875
And I never, never stopped
loving her or you.

101
00:04:27,917 --> 00:04:30,041
You destroyed our lives.

102
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:34,291
You ruined my childhood,
and that is not love.

103
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,041
And now suddenly
because you want to change,

104
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,542
because you're sorry, which by
the way, you haven't even said,

105
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,625
two words you've
never said--"I'm sorry"--

106
00:04:40,667 --> 00:04:42,333
does not mean
I'm gonna forgive you.

107
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,500
I don't forgive you

108
00:04:44,542 --> 00:04:47,041
and I will never--oh.

109
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:49,667
What is it? What's wrong?
Oh, my--
I think my water broke.

110
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:51,041
Well, c-can I help?

111
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,041
No, you can just get
the hell out of my life.

112
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,583
Get out. Just go.

113
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:07,583
It's okay. It's okay.

114
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,125
Everything looks good,

115
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,709
but you're only 5 centimeters
dilated.

116
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,709
So what happens now?

117
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,583
Well, Jim, our e.M.T.,

118
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:18,041
is going to transport you
to the hospital in style.

119
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:21,041
And I paged your regular o.B.
They'll meet you over there.

120
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,166
Ready?

121
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:24,375
Yeah. Okay, Jim,
it's just you and me.

122
00:05:24,417 --> 00:05:25,959
Though you'll probably
leave me, too,

123
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,041
just like all the other men
in my life.

124
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,291
Debra, I really think

125
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:30,542
your father wants to be there
for you.

126
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:32,041
I'm in enough pain already.

127
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,500
I don't need him
bringing me more, but thanks.

128
00:05:40,667 --> 00:05:42,750
You okay?

129
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:45,208
I just want to stay here.

130
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,208
It's safe in here.

131
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,709
If I go back to my office,
I will spend hours learning

132
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,792
about the rules
of conjugal visits in prison.

133
00:05:51,834 --> 00:05:53,041
Prison.

134
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:56,041
My husband could go to prison.

135
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,583
How crazy is that?

136
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,542
You want me to take
the afternoon off? We could--

137
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:00,959
we could what?

138
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,792
I don't know. Get drunk.

139
00:06:02,834 --> 00:06:04,667
It's not a terrible idea, except
I have to go to court later.

140
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:06,250
Distract me
with something else.

141
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,667
I could tap-dance for you.

142
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:10,458
Say the word.
I will slap two tacks

143
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,834
on the bottom of these shoes
right now.

144
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:15,542
- Three years.
- Mrs. Sobel's dance academy.

145
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,542
Yeah, I do a mean shuffle.

146
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:20,458
No? Oh. Oh. I know.

147
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,041
Medical instruments.
Puppet show.

148
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,625
I'm hungry.

149
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:27,834
Hey. How is your love life?
Distract me with that.

150
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:30,458
My husband
might go to prison.

151
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,375
Okay.

152
00:06:33,417 --> 00:06:34,709
I don't know.

153
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,583
I mean, I'm just--he's...

154
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,709
I don't know.
What--what don't you know?

155
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,542

156
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,041
Hey, ed.

157
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,625
What are
you still doing here?

158
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:52,041
Um, I don't know
where to go.

159
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,166
What about the hospital?

160
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,166
She doesn't want me around.

161
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,208
Your biggest regret is that

162
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,375
the last time she told you
to leave, you listened.

163
00:07:00,417 --> 00:07:03,041
No matter how old she gets
or even when Debra's a mother,

164
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,041
you will still be her father.

165
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:09,000
I don't know. You know,
I mean, what's the point?

166
00:07:10,667 --> 00:07:13,333
How many times did you try
to get sober?

167
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:15,291
Really try?

168
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,500
Uh, just now.

169
00:07:17,542 --> 00:07:21,125
Eh, one foot in the grave.
It's crazy.

170
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,625
It's inspiring.

171
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:24,750
I think most people your age
would just drink till the end.

172
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:27,291
I don't want to meet my maker
with booze on my breath

173
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:30,458
and destroyed lives
on my resume.

174
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:35,041
It sounds like you know
what you have to do then.

175
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,041
I'm sorry
to interrupt.

176
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,500
Oh. No, it's okay.

177
00:07:37,542 --> 00:07:38,750
I have to go.

178
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,000
Thank you.

179
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,375
I mean,

180
00:07:44,417 --> 00:07:46,291
seriously,
I'm like Michael Phelps.

181
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:50,875
Roberta?

182
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:52,375
Where is your husband,
Violet?

183
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:54,542
Pete's not here? He--he was
gonna meet you at your office.

184
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,041
He never showed.

185
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,709
I called the house. I've been
calling his cell repeatedly.

186
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,458
Please rise.

187
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,583
The honorable judge Hansen
presiding.

188
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,333
Are we missing someone?

189
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:11,959
Your honor, I'd like to request
a short recess. My client--

190
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,083
is absent. Why?

191
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,542
We don't know yet,

192
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:15,834
but I'm sure there's
a perfectly logical explanation.

193
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,959
Your honor,
I-I know he's coming.

194
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,959
I'm sorry, but the defendant
failed to appear,

195
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,500
so bail is forfeited.

196
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:26,041
I'm ordering a warrant
for the arrest of Pete Wilder.

197
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,709
Well, something must've
happened. Maybe he got a flat.

198
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,208
Well, he could've called.
There's no reception
in the canyon.

199
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,542
How do--how do you not show up
for court?

200
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,542
You don't go missing
on the first day of your trial.

201
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,500
He's--he's--he's missing.
Well, should you call
the police?

202
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:39,125
You think I should call
the police?

203
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,417
Is it police-calling time?

204
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,583
She cannot call the police.

205
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,250
I just mean
that in their eyes,

206
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,667
he's just some fugitive
who jumped bail.

207
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:47,750
Oh, my god.
Violet.

208
00:08:47,792 --> 00:08:49,875
Oh, my god. I'm an idiot.
I'm an idiot.
Violet.

209
00:08:49,917 --> 00:08:52,000
He jumped bail and ran.
He ran. He ran.
No. No. No. No. No.
No. No. No. No.

210
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,458
Violet,
that is not what I meant.

211
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,041
Charlotte, help me out here,
please.
Well, he coulda run.

212
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,041
Charlotte!
I'm being honest with her.

213
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,333
He ran. He ran.
No.

214
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,667
He ran.
Violet--

215
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:02,333
damn it! Ugh! A couple weeks
ago, we were out for a walk,

216
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,000
and Lucas saw a plane,
and he pointed up to it,

217
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,625
and Pete said, "let's go.

218
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:10,041
"We can all fly to central
america, the three of us.

219
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,750
We can stay together
and help people."

220
00:09:11,792 --> 00:09:13,625
I thought it was a fantasy.

221
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:15,625
It probably was!
No, it isn't,
because right about now,

222
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:18,041
Pete is enjoying the in-flight
movie on his way to El Salvador.

223
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,083
He--he gave up. He gave up.

224
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,041
I can't believe
he would do that.

225
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:22,834
This morning
he sent me a text.

226
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,625
"Whatever happens,
know that I love you."

227
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,625
Well, Pete did grow up
with a mother in jail.

228
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:31,709
He knows firsthand
how hard it is

229
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,250
to be a kid
on the other side of the bars.

230
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:36,709
So you think he's protecting
Lucas. Are you kidding me?

231
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,709
Pete was looking out for Pete.

232
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,166
My husband is weak

233
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,709
and selfish and a coward,

234
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,000
and I will never forgive him
for this.

235
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,750

Yeah, it vibrated,
like, ten times.

00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,917
Megan Stewart.

260
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:24,041
You know how my patients get
in the first trimester.

261
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,959
Mm. She does have a husband,
right?

262
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,417
Well, he's away on business,
so until he gets back,

263
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:29,792
I guess I'm her husband.

264
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:36,583
That's Megan. Mm. Huh?

265
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:39,250
Hey, Megan.
What's going on?

266
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,625
My husband
might go to prison.

267
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:45,542
Okay.

268
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,041
I don't know.

269
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,125
I mean, I'm just--
he's...

270
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,583
I don't know.

271
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,041
What--what don't you know?

272
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,333
I don't know.

273
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:57,041
I don't--okay. He...

274
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,583
I definitely made
the right choice.

275
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,792
He makes me very happy.

276
00:12:00,834 --> 00:12:03,208
I am really, really happy.

277
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,709
But?

278
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,500
Have you seen him?

279
00:12:07,542 --> 00:12:08,625
T-Today?

280
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:10,792
No, I mean,
have you laid eyes on him?

281
00:12:10,834 --> 00:12:13,375
He's a-attractive.
Is that what you mean?

282
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:14,792
He's not "attractive."

283
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,375
He is Zeus.

284
00:12:16,417 --> 00:12:18,458
He's Thor.
He's Beckham.

285
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,875
You're--you're mixing up your
mythologies and soccer players.

286
00:12:20,917 --> 00:12:23,625
Okay, he's flypaper
and women are the flies.

287
00:12:23,667 --> 00:12:26,041
Sam is not flypaper?

288
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,500
Yeah, but Sam doesn't spend
his days

289
00:12:27,542 --> 00:12:30,375
putting the pretty flies' legs
up in stirrups.

290
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,667
Okay.

291
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:33,625
Thank you.

292
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:35,417
Good. Good.
Oh, I'm very glad.

293
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:39,041
I'm glad that my humiliating
insecurity is giving you joy.

294
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:41,500
I mean, Sam's patients are
worried about their hearts,

295
00:12:41,542 --> 00:12:42,834
Derek's are
generally brain-damaged,

296
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:45,041
but Jake's are in love
with him

297
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,625
because he can give them
a gift

298
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:49,208
that not even their own husbands
can give them.

299
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,917
The man makes babies,

300
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:55,291
and he's kind and gentle
and compassionate,

301
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,834
and he looks like that.

302
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:59,041
What's funny?

303
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,250
Apparently, my inner workings.

304
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,542
Well, are you done?

305
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,458
I need Addison.

306
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,750
Debra diamanti, 39 weeks.

307
00:13:09,792 --> 00:13:11,542
Contractions are regular
and four minutes apart.

308
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,959
Okay, Debra. I'm Dr. Reilly.
Let's, uh, let's have a look.

309
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,667
Uh, wait. Where's my o.B.?
He was supposed to meet me here.

310
00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:19,083
Dr. Myer got held up at cedars,
delivering another baby,

311
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,875
so you're in luck.
You have me today.
Don't worry.

312
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:23,583
I'm the best labor and delivery
nurse at St. ambrose.

313
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:26,125
Dr. Reilly's just someone they
yell at when the pain gets bad.

314
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,500
Okay, I'm gonna take a look.
All right?

315
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:30,583
Okay.

316
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,291
Okay, you're
at about 5 centimeters.

317
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,709
Looks like you have
a little bit of time.

318
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,041
Oh. Oh! Oh!
This totally sucks.

319
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:41,041
Ooh, and it hurts. Ooh!

320
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:43,125
Ooh. My best friend, who was
supposed to be here, is in cabo.

321
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:46,000
Bitch. I told her not to go.

322
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,417
Due dates aren't written
in stone.

323
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,917
But did she listen? No.

324
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:52,583
Ohh. You know she's drinking
a Mai Tai, right?

325
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,166
Or screwing some lifeguard.

326
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,750
Or catching an s.T.D.

327
00:13:55,792 --> 00:13:58,625
Is there anyone else
we can call? Any family?

328
00:13:58,667 --> 00:14:01,041
Oh.

329
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,125
Nope.

330
00:14:05,792 --> 00:14:07,166
Are you okay?

331
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,083
Can you just get on
with it?

332
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:12,166
All right. Try to relax.
This shouldn't take long.

333
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,750
The last time
you poked around down there

334
00:14:21,792 --> 00:14:23,333
was after I was raped.

335
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,667
It's weird, uncomfortable.

336
00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:29,041
Can you talk about something?

337
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,458
How's Henry?

338
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,542
Uh, well, Jake said that
he took his first few steps.

339
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,041
Of course,
I don't believe him.

340
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,166
Mm.
I mean, he is an overachiever
like his mother, but--

341
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:39,208
stop.

342
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,625
Do you want me to stop the--

343
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:44,917
talking. Stop talking
and get this over with.

344
00:14:46,917 --> 00:14:49,250
If I'm still at 5 centimeters,
I might have to kill you.

345
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:50,500
You're at 7.

346
00:14:50,542 --> 00:14:51,625
Where the hell is Stephanie?

347
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:53,625
I paged her.
I'm sure she's coming.

348
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:54,834
Ooh.

349
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,583
As for the pain,
this should help.

350
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:58,208
No--no--no needles.
No, I hate needles.

351
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,583
Well, most people do,

352
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:02,291
but, Debra, this will last
for, like, two seconds.

353
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,041
The pain of labor could last
for another couple hours.

354
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,417
No, it's not about the pain.
It--they conjure an image.

355
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,500
It's a memory.

356
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:14,041
My dad is a drunk
and a bastard,

357
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:17,041
and my whole childhood
was spent in the E.R.,

358
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,458
waiting while he would
get treated for dehydration

359
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,041
with I.V.S and needles,

360
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,542
and I just can't think
about that right now.

361
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:24,625
I can't,

362
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:27,709
'cause I'm about
to be a mother,

363
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,500
And he was
the worst father in the world,

364
00:15:29,542 --> 00:15:31,041
and what if I'm like him?

365
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,041
All right. Listen to me.
Listen to me.
No.

366
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,041
Listen to me, okay?
Are you listening?

367
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,834
You'll be a great mother.

368
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,667
And you will make mistakes.
Every parent does.

369
00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:40,625
But you can do this,
because this right here,

370
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:42,834
this is the most beautiful thing
in the whole world,

371
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,667
and yes, there is a little bit
of pain, but it's temporary.

372
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:47,291
All right?
And when it's all over,

373
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,625
I'm gonna hand you your baby,
and you will experience

374
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:52,667
a joy the likes of which
you've never felt.

375
00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:55,083
And that's why I do this--
for that moment, your moment.

376
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:57,458
So I need you to trust me,

377
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,917
to put your faith in me
just a little while longer.

378
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,250
I will take care of you.

379
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,542
Okay?

380
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,041
Okay.

381
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,625
Good.

382
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,417
Go ahead
and roll over on your side.

383
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,000
Okay.

384
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:14,291
Okay.

385
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:17,291
Good. Close your eyes. Count
to 50 as loud as you want.

386
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,542
Yell even.

387
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:21,583
Okay. One. Oh. Two.

388
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:25,041
Three. Four...
There was an emergency.

389
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,041
Five, six...
Something's happened
to her father.

390
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,333
All right.
Don't tell her. Not yet.

391
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,959
Seven, eight...

392
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,709
Pete should've stayed.
You stay and fight.

393
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,083
That's what you do.

394
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,041
Yeah, well, what if you can't?
What if you're losing yourself?

395
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,917
I mean, isn't it better
to just run for the hills?

396
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:40,875
Are we still talking
about Pete?

397
00:16:42,792 --> 00:16:44,500
I'm not me.

398
00:16:44,542 --> 00:16:48,041
Need a little help
following here.

399
00:16:49,792 --> 00:16:51,917
I got up at 5:00.

400
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:53,542
I do that
when you stay over.

401
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:54,625
I am not stunning
in the morning.

402
00:16:54,667 --> 00:16:56,375
I'm kind of a hot mess,

403
00:16:56,417 --> 00:16:58,166
but when you see me,
I'm all made up,

404
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,709
you know, because I'm trying
to be all I can be,

405
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,458
but I'm failing miserably

406
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,250
because--i just used
an army slogan to make my point.

407
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,000
Forget it. I-I-I don't know
what I'm saying.

408
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,625
No. No. Keep--keep talking.

409
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:09,041
One of us
will figure it out.

410
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,792
I check my phone a lot.

411
00:17:11,834 --> 00:17:13,583
I'm--i'm--i'm--i'm, like,
willing it to buzz,

412
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,583
because it might be you,

413
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:18,000
and then when it is you, I get
this feeling in my stomach.

414
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,542
It's, like, um,
it could be butterflies,

415
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:21,458
but it hurts, like, pain.

416
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,041
I mean, actual physical pain,

417
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:27,250
like--like an ulcer or a tumor,
but it's not.

418
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:28,458
It's you.

419
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,542
Did you just refer to me
as cancer?

420
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:33,041
I can't focus,
I-I forget to eat,

421
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,583
I'm insecure, I'm jealous.

422
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,792
I mean, I more closely resemble
my 14-year-old self

423
00:17:36,834 --> 00:17:39,041
than the woman I have come
to recognize as me,

424
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,291
which is what I meant

425
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:44,291
when I said I'm not me,
and...

426
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,166
Which is also what I meant
when I,

427
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:49,583
yes, maybe accidentally
referred to you as...

428
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,291
Cancer.

429
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:55,625
Oh, my god. This conversation
was a bad idea. I gotta go.

430
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:05,875
♪♪♪

431
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,417
Uh, okay.

432
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:26,500
I got one. Uh, what did
the zero say to the eight?

433
00:18:26,542 --> 00:18:27,875
Nice belt.

434
00:18:27,917 --> 00:18:29,333
That joke wasn't funny.

435
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,333
Mason thought it was funny.

436
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,083
No, dad, I really didn't.

437
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,667
Why are
you really laughing?

438
00:18:33,709 --> 00:18:35,250
Earthquake!

439
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:36,542
Triangle of life!

440
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,333
Mase, it's over already.

441
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,625
Triangle of life?
What is that?

442
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:43,542
They did a unit on earthquake
preparedness last week,

443
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,500
and we now have
enough bottled water

444
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,542
to get us through
the apocalypse.

445
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,291
Clean water is very important.

446
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,667
So is getting to school on time.
Come on.

447
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,083
Uh...

448
00:18:57,125 --> 00:19:00,542
I have, uh, something to say,

449
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,041
but do not get excited.

450
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,959
I will not get excited.

451
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,500
Wait. You're not saying
"don't freak out"?

452
00:19:07,542 --> 00:19:09,750
Does that mean
it's a good thing?

453
00:19:09,792 --> 00:19:11,000
You're pregnant?

454
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,250
Oh, my god.

455
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,542
Oh, my god! Oh, my god.
Wait. Are you pregnant?

456
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,709
I said, do not get excited.
Oh. Oh. Oh. Okay. Okay.

457
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,041
But you're pregnant?

458
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,500
I have an I.U.D.

459
00:19:21,542 --> 00:19:23,041
I know. I know.
Which means you have, like,

460
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:26,000
a 1% chance
of getting pregnant,

461
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,917
which means that if you are,
maybe it was meant to be?

462
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,709
The I.U.D. Has to be removed,

463
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,750
and when it is, it's likely
that I'll miscarry.

464
00:19:32,792 --> 00:19:34,625
You might not.

465
00:19:34,667 --> 00:19:37,417
And we might have a little--
a little baby girl,

466
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:39,125
a little towheaded Charlie.

467
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:40,542
Were you ever
a natural blonde?

468
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,834
I'm gonna go see Addison later.

469
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,625
In the meantime,
not a word to anyone.

470
00:19:44,667 --> 00:19:46,959
Pregnant.

471
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,417
Not for long.

472
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,625
Hi.

473
00:19:58,917 --> 00:20:00,583
Sorry I couldn't make it
this morning.

474
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,208
Hope she saved me some cake.

475
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,375
Since when do you eat cake?

476
00:20:03,417 --> 00:20:05,667
Ugh. I'm gonna kill Cooper.

477
00:20:05,709 --> 00:20:07,709
They're for you.

478
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:10,583
Wait. Wait.

479
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,667
Why would you
be getting flowers today?

480
00:20:12,709 --> 00:20:14,583
Did I miss something or...

481
00:20:15,792 --> 00:20:17,792
How far along are you?

482
00:20:17,834 --> 00:20:19,333
A couple months,
give or take.

483
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,583
This is the downside
of your kind of I.U.D.

484
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:24,041
Is irregular periods.

485
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,500
That
and an unplanned pregnancy.

486
00:20:25,542 --> 00:20:27,500
Anyway,
this should take care of it.

487
00:20:27,542 --> 00:20:28,583
Well, not necessarily.

488
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,834
I am very good at my job.

489
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:34,000
Well, no need to be
an overachiever today.

490
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,458
Well, if I can't help myself

491
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,458
from being the best,

492
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,792
you do have options.

493
00:20:40,834 --> 00:20:42,041
No, I don't.

494
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,417
You know, there's
a common misconception

495
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,583
that being pro-choice
means you relish the opportunity

496
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:49,041
to run into an alley
with a hanger.

497
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,500
I believe
in a woman's right to choose,

498
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:52,083
but I don't have that choice.

499
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,500
All right, well, go ahead

500
00:20:53,542 --> 00:20:55,041
and put your feet up
in the stirrups.

501
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:58,291
You can lean back
and use this to--
yeah. I know the drill.

502
00:20:58,333 --> 00:20:59,625
I thought
you didn't want kids.

503
00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:01,291
I don't.

504
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,208
I got Mason,

505
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,041
and I love him,

506
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,625
but I don't want kids.

507
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:10,041
The only thing is I'm not 16
or single

508
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:13,083
or without means.

509
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,458
I can't justify.

510
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:18,875
You need to not be great
at your job today

511
00:21:18,917 --> 00:21:21,041
because I don't have options.

512
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,667
Are you okay?

513
00:21:22,709 --> 00:21:26,041
Can you just get on with it?

514
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,458
It's gonna be okay.

515
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,041
I appreciate you trying to
make me feel better, Cooper.

516
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:35,542
And no one wants good news
more than me.

517
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:37,500
Charlotte's pregnant.
Oh, my god!

518
00:21:37,542 --> 00:21:39,041
That's amazing.

519
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:41,667
Wow. She'd kill you
for telling me.

520
00:21:41,709 --> 00:21:43,125
You know, she has an I.U.D.,
so she doesn't think

521
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:45,750
the pregnancy's
gonna be viable, but, um...

522
00:21:45,792 --> 00:21:47,458
So why are you happy?

523
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,250

00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:51,041
What?

525
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:54,500
My swimmers--they beat
the big, bad I.U.D., man.

526
00:21:54,542 --> 00:21:56,709
Oh.

527
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,166
I mean,

528
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:01,500
seriously,
I'm like Michael Phelps.

I thought she was coming over
for a play date.

She was,
but Natasha got jealous,

537
00:22:19,792 --> 00:22:23,208

So I can play alone.

Today I removed a hard piece

That could be
what's causing the bleeding.

A year.

578
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,959
Wow.

579
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,917
You people saved my life,

580
00:24:15,959 --> 00:24:19,000
and I'm grateful every day,

581
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:22,542
'cause the man I loved
wasn't so lucky,

582
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:25,250
and I don't know why I get
to be here and he doesn't,

583
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:28,542
but, um, all I know is,

584
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:33,041
one day at a time, you carried
me through my grief,

585
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:36,500
and you carried me through
my pregnancy and my...

586
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:42,500
I stayed sober this year,

587
00:24:42,542 --> 00:24:44,250
for 365 days,

588
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:47,667
and that is no small miracle.

589
00:24:47,709 --> 00:24:50,834
And I can't take credit for it.

590
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:55,083
These steps, these rooms,
you people...

591
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:58,000
You carried me through.

592
00:25:06,834 --> 00:25:09,709
That was an earthquake, right?
I'm not delirious with joy.

593
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,500
That was maybe both.

594
00:25:11,542 --> 00:25:12,583
I'm so proud of you.

595
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:16,166
You want some cake?

596
00:25:16,208 --> 00:25:18,208
Uh, yes, but I have
a physical with Sam,

597
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,166
and if my sugar is up,
I have to listen to him

598
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:21,959
and his perfect form
lecture me about it,

599
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,250
so, I um, I just--
I gotta run.

600
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:25,375
Yeah.

601
00:25:25,417 --> 00:25:26,583
Okay.

602
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:28,000
Bye.

603
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:32,625
Hey, ed.

604
00:25:32,667 --> 00:25:34,208
Hey, you.

605
00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:37,542
Oh, don't look at me
like a doctor.

606
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:39,333
I can't drink.
I can't smoke.

607
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:40,875
The only joy I get is

608
00:25:40,917 --> 00:25:43,667
when somebody has a birthday
around here, and I can eat cake.

609
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,041
Ed, I don't judge.

610
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:48,125
Hey. When is your appointment
with Dr. Turner?

611
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:50,625
What appointment?

612
00:25:52,458 --> 00:25:53,500
I'm scared.

613
00:25:55,208 --> 00:25:57,291
I don't think I can do this.

614
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:00,583
It's too late, Amelia.

615
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:03,041
No.

616
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:06,083
For Ryan, for my baby,

617
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:07,834
it's too late.

618
00:26:07,875 --> 00:26:09,709
We're still here, ed.

619
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:14,500
I want it noted for the record
that I resisted cake today.

620
00:26:14,542 --> 00:26:17,083
Well, I didn't say "never."
I just said "in moderation."

621
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:19,667
Yeah, I'm too old to moderate.
It's all or nothing.

622
00:26:19,709 --> 00:26:22,291
I spent the weekend in Chicago
eating skinless chicken breast.

623
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:23,583
I-I was miserable,

624
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:26,041
except for the company.
It was...

625
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:27,709
Breathe in.

626
00:26:28,709 --> 00:26:30,208
Ah, the ex.

627
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,709
Does she have a name?

628
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,834
Because I think
if you're seeing your ex,

629
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:35,333
she's not really your ex.

630
00:26:35,375 --> 00:26:36,542
Laura.

631
00:26:36,583 --> 00:26:39,291
Laura. Well, you must be
pretty happy with Laura

632
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:41,542
'cause your blood pressure's
never been this low.

633
00:26:41,583 --> 00:26:43,041
Yeah, well, I wish
I could see her more.

634
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:44,750
I mean, I see her.

635
00:26:44,792 --> 00:26:47,041
We meet in a new
and exciting city every month.

636
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:48,917
We have three marvelous days
at the four seasons

637
00:26:48,959 --> 00:26:51,041
and go back to our lives,

638
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:53,041
and it works. There's no fear
of failure this way.

639
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:55,041
There's nothing to fight about.
We don't get sick of each other.

640
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:57,542
It's, you know, it's...
It's perfect.

641
00:26:57,583 --> 00:26:59,208
Except you wish
you could see her more.

642
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,917
Well, if I did,
it might not work.

643
00:27:01,959 --> 00:27:03,792
If you don't try for real,
you can't know.

644
00:27:03,834 --> 00:27:05,542
We did try for real.

645
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:07,917
We were married
and subsequently divorced.

646
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:13,000
And the idea of two strikes
gives me pause.

647
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:19,041
Look, Sam, I'm sorry. I-I don't
want to bug you about Addison.

648
00:27:19,083 --> 00:27:20,333
But a--

649
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:21,959
are you okay?

650
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
They're for you.

651
00:27:25,917 --> 00:27:27,500
Wait. Wait. Why would you be
getting flowers today?

652
00:27:27,542 --> 00:27:30,041
Did I miss something or...

653
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:31,166
Who are they from?

654
00:27:31,208 --> 00:27:33,750
Oh, my ex Laura.
I should have her move here.

655
00:27:33,792 --> 00:27:36,041
You know, maybe it could work
this time.
What happened last time?

656
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:39,041
Well, I wanted children,
and she didn't and...

657
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:40,625
You don't want 'em anymore?

658
00:27:40,667 --> 00:27:42,041
Well, when you're young,

659
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:43,792
there are certain things
you think are deal breakers

660
00:27:43,834 --> 00:27:46,291
because you don't know
how elusive love is,

661
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:49,750
but later, what you want--
well, it changes.

662
00:27:49,792 --> 00:27:51,959
Not always.

663
00:27:53,625 --> 00:27:56,000
Stopping to smell the roses?

664
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:03,375
Did you hear?

665
00:28:03,417 --> 00:28:04,583
I don't buy it.

666
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:06,041
Pete didn't run.

667
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:07,583
Pete doesn't run
from the tough stuff.

668
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:10,083
I mean,
he risked his medical license,

669
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:13,125
his freedom, and his family
to help Troy find peace.

670
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:15,250
And--and Troy wasn't
the only one he did it for.

671
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:17,792
When my friend Michelle
didn't want to end her days

672
00:28:17,834 --> 00:28:19,208
twitching and incoherent
from huntington's,

673
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:21,041
I didn't have that strength.

674
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:24,542
I ran. I escaped. I-I...
I couldn't get high fast enough.

675
00:28:24,583 --> 00:28:26,125
Well, Amelia, w--

676
00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:28,542
well, part of your recovery is
about taking responsibility

677
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:30,208
for your failures.

678
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,625
This last year, you've shown
tremendous strength.

679
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:35,625
Tremendous. And I won't let you
undervalue your accomplishments

680
00:28:35,667 --> 00:28:37,417
and the pride you should feel.

681
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:38,667
No, not ever,

682
00:28:38,709 --> 00:28:39,583
but especially not today.

683
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:42,917
I mean,
why would you go there?

684
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:49,500
You need to live
a very, very long time.

685
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:54,041
I never would've made it here.

686
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:56,291
And it is gonna take
the rest of my life

687
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:58,625
for me
to make it up to you, so...

688
00:28:58,667 --> 00:29:01,166
You need to live a long time.

689
00:29:05,291 --> 00:29:07,834
Violet?

690
00:29:07,875 --> 00:29:10,667
Sheldon,
I'm glad I found you.

691
00:29:10,709 --> 00:29:13,250
Oh, did we have plans?
No, I have your blood results.

Don't tell me my cholesterol
is back up again.

I've been doing everything
you told me to.

00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,041
Hey.

700
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:55,250
Mm.

701
00:29:58,041 --> 00:29:59,709
Ha ha.

702
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,041
We have an earthquake,

703
00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:02,875
and the first thing
you grab is the juice.

704
00:30:02,917 --> 00:30:05,333
I was trying to save
the pancakes from the juice.

705
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:06,375
Okay.

706
00:30:06,417 --> 00:30:08,000
Mm.

707
00:30:08,041 --> 00:30:11,041
I wasn't sure how I was gonna be
first night at your place.

708
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:13,458
I usually toss and turn
and stare at the ceiling.

709
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,458
You looked so peaceful.

710
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,000
You have
a really good mattress.

711
00:30:17,542 --> 00:30:19,500
And it was
a really good night.

712
00:30:27,083 --> 00:30:29,208
Look, Sam, I'm sorry. I don't
want to bug you about Addison.

713
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,500
But a-are you okay?

714
00:30:30,542 --> 00:30:32,792
I'm fine. Yeah.

715
00:30:32,834 --> 00:30:33,917
All right.

716
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:36,417
Sam.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

717
00:30:36,458 --> 00:30:37,625
Well, it sucks when you're
not the one they choose.

718
00:30:37,667 --> 00:30:39,041
Well, sometimes you're...

719
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:40,709
A little too late.

720
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:43,959
I don't know. Maybe we weren't
meant to be together.

721
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,291
Either you're a very good liar,

722
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:48,083
or psychologically,
you're very healthy.

723
00:30:48,125 --> 00:30:51,041
Well, it looks like we both
got our checkups today.

724
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:52,166
All right. Hop down.

725
00:30:53,417 --> 00:30:54,750
Let's go.

726
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:01,709
Perhaps a doctor
with smaller hands...

727
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:05,625
Hey. Good luck today.

728
00:31:05,667 --> 00:31:07,208
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

729
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:09,542
- What?
- Oh, come on, Sam.

730
00:31:09,583 --> 00:31:12,041
Could you just admit it?
We all know. Everyone knows.

731
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:14,542
- You all know what?
- If he doesn't want to talk about it--

732
00:31:14,583 --> 00:31:16,041
we talk about
everything here.

733
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:18,959
Maybe we shouldn't.
I gotta go. I'm on call.

734
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,041
Sam, everyone knows about
you and Stephanie.

735
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:22,625
I don't know.
Who--who's Stephanie?

736
00:31:22,667 --> 00:31:23,959
A labor and delivery nurse.

737
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,041
She's great.
Stole her from u.C.L.A.

738
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:29,625
Come on.
Just nod your head.

739
00:31:29,667 --> 00:31:32,041
Have you seen a car
in his driveway?

740
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:34,041
What am I, neighborhood watch?
This is none of our business.

741
00:31:34,083 --> 00:31:37,041
C--i just--i need
a little vicarious thrill, okay?

742
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:38,709
Especially now.
Cooper.

743
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,625
Sorry.

744
00:31:39,667 --> 00:31:41,041
Would you
deny me that?

745
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:43,917
You know what?
You're being a baby.

746
00:31:43,959 --> 00:31:46,583
I am the only adult
at this table right now.

747
00:31:46,625 --> 00:31:48,792
I'm an adult.
I'm perpetually in the dark,

748
00:31:48,834 --> 00:31:51,750
but I'm very much an adult.

749
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:55,417
Hey.
Can I...

750
00:31:55,458 --> 00:31:57,000
Sure. Sure. What's up?

751
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:01,291
I'm sorry...

752
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:02,625
About earlier with Cooper.

753
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:05,709
If you're trying
to keep your life private

754
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,667
out of respect for me, you know,
you don't need to do that.

755
00:32:07,709 --> 00:32:09,041
Oh, no, Addison.

756
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:11,625
Um, I proposed, you said no,

757
00:32:11,667 --> 00:32:14,959
and you were right.
I mean, what did you call it?

758
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,333
My hail Mary pass?

759
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:18,500
No, my--my timing was off.

760
00:32:18,542 --> 00:32:20,083
Or our timing.

761
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:23,041
Whatever.

762
00:32:23,083 --> 00:32:24,500
But I'm fine.

763
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:27,041
You sure?

764
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:29,959
Because all--all I want is
for you to be happy.

765
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:33,000
I am happy.

766
00:32:34,917 --> 00:32:36,375
Really.

767
00:32:36,417 --> 00:32:39,458
I mean, I don't want Pete
to have to serve time.

768
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,917
I really don't, but, you know,
he did end a man's life.

769
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:43,750
But still, you can see
why he did it.

770
00:32:43,792 --> 00:32:45,667
Yes. But he risked too much.
All right?

771
00:32:45,709 --> 00:32:48,125
The man's got a wife,
he's got a little kid, and--

772
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:50,500
it's easier to take chances
when you're single.

773
00:32:50,542 --> 00:32:52,750
So it sucks you met me, huh?

774
00:32:52,792 --> 00:32:55,583
Oh, about that. Uh...

775
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:57,875
I think that
we have been outed.

776
00:32:57,917 --> 00:33:00,542
Good. When a guy doesn't
tell his friends,

777
00:33:00,583 --> 00:33:03,333
you don't know
where you stand.

778
00:33:03,375 --> 00:33:06,041
Oh, I'm sorry. I did--

779
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:07,291
I like you.

780
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:09,041
I like you a lot.

781
00:33:09,083 --> 00:33:11,583
All right, the only reason...

782
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:13,000
Doctors at the practice--

783
00:33:13,041 --> 00:33:14,500
we're always talking about
everything,

784
00:33:14,542 --> 00:33:16,500
and I guess--

785
00:33:16,542 --> 00:33:20,291
I don't know, I guess I just--
I don't wanna share you.

786
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:23,875
Well, if we are outed,
I can do this now.

787
00:33:27,625 --> 00:33:29,041
All right.

788
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,709
Excuse me, sir?

789
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,000
Me?

790
00:33:35,041 --> 00:33:36,041
Yes, sir.
What's--what's your name?

791
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:37,291
Ed.

792
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:38,709
Okay, ed, are you
feeling all right?

793
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:42,000
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm here
to see my daughter Debra.

794
00:33:42,041 --> 00:33:43,959
She's having a baby.
Okay, you don't--
you don't look well.

795
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,333
Uh, ed, do you mind
if I check you out?

796
00:33:46,375 --> 00:33:48,875
No, I don't have time.
I need to find my kid.

797
00:33:48,917 --> 00:33:50,667
See, I gotta tell her
what a nice--uhh!

798
00:33:50,709 --> 00:33:52,041
Oh!
Whoa. Whoa.

799
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:53,750
Whoa. Okay.

800
00:33:53,792 --> 00:33:56,208
Okay. Easy.

801
00:33:58,917 --> 00:34:00,417
I'm gonna need a--

802
00:34:00,458 --> 00:34:01,667
crash cart!
Yeah.

803
00:34:01,709 --> 00:34:02,667
Got it!
We need some help over here!

804
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:03,959
All right. Hold on.

805
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:12,208
I have to see my daughter.

806
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,583
Well, you just had
a cardiac event.

807
00:34:14,625 --> 00:34:16,291
Is that
what they call it now?

808
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:19,041
It sounds like
a bar mitzvah.

809
00:34:19,083 --> 00:34:22,583
That's not funny. I've got to
unclog your coronary artery,

810
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:24,875
then monitor
your heart function,

811
00:34:24,917 --> 00:34:28,500
then you have to rest,
then maybe you can see her.

812
00:34:28,542 --> 00:34:30,875
I'm not gonna die.

813
00:34:30,917 --> 00:34:32,041
I mean, eventually, sure,

814
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:35,458
but let me ask you something,
doc.

815
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,041
This cardiac event of mine--

816
00:34:38,083 --> 00:34:42,208
if I was taking a shower
or watching TV,

817
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,458
playing poker at the commerce,

818
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,375
I'd be dead now, right?

819
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,375
Yeah.

820
00:34:51,792 --> 00:34:56,834
I never believed
in a higher power before today.

821
00:34:56,875 --> 00:35:01,709
But today, I was visited
by his emissaries.

822
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:04,458
I didn't want to go
to my meeting this morning,

823
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,083
but they were using jackhammers
outside of my house,

824
00:35:07,125 --> 00:35:08,625
and I couldn't sleep.

825
00:35:08,667 --> 00:35:13,834
Then this sweet kid at a.A.
Gave this nice little speech.

826
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:15,875
Gave me a kick in my behind.

827
00:35:15,917 --> 00:35:20,041
And this shrink
made me realize,

828
00:35:20,083 --> 00:35:24,041
I couldn't move on
until I made things right,

829
00:35:24,083 --> 00:35:27,709
and I came to see my daughter.

830
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,000
Then I ran into you...

831
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,375
A heart guy
on a maternity ward,

832
00:35:35,417 --> 00:35:40,333
because you were flirting
with a pretty nurse.

833
00:35:41,709 --> 00:35:45,583
I had a cardiac event
in front of you,

834
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:48,542
and that's why I lived.

835
00:35:50,166 --> 00:35:52,041
Do you believe
in a higher power?

836
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:54,542
I believe in god.

837
00:35:56,750 --> 00:36:00,625
He all but came down
and told us,

838
00:36:00,667 --> 00:36:03,041
it's not my time.

839
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:05,041
Not yet.

840
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:08,834
I have something left to do

841
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,542
and I need to do it.

842
00:36:24,542 --> 00:36:27,041
Hey. So...

843
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:29,000
We're okay, you and me.

844
00:36:29,041 --> 00:36:31,834
You said we were okay
two months ago.

845
00:36:31,875 --> 00:36:33,959
Yeah, I was lying.
I lied... two months ago.

846
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,208
But now--
now we're really okay.

847
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:39,041
Okay.

848
00:36:39,083 --> 00:36:40,125
Good.

849
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:41,583
All right.

850
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,041
