00:00:03,291 --> 00:00:05,083
♪ Ohhh ohhh ohhh ♪

2
00:00:06,959 --> 00:00:09,500
All righty.

3
00:00:11,542 --> 00:00:13,875
Juice.

4
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:26,041
Okay.

5
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:27,333
Boom.

6
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:29,041
Boom. Whoa.

7
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:32,041
Sam, could you
just reset for us?

8
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:34,875
Uh, just reset?

9
00:00:34,917 --> 00:00:37,041
Make it look like
you never touched your plate.

10
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:39,959
Oh, right. Okay. O-Okay.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,667
Reset.

12
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:46,375
Okay.
Still learning the lingo.

13
00:00:46,417 --> 00:00:48,542
Like, uh, like this?

14
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:49,750
You are a natural.

15
00:00:49,792 --> 00:00:50,959
Okay. Excellent.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,041
Eat at will.

17
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:53,875
Will do.

18
00:00:58,542 --> 00:00:59,917
Wait. Okay, wait.

19
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:01,083
Are you sure you don't
want to start filming

20
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:03,083
until after I see
my first patient?

21
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:05,041
If we're gonna sell
this pilot to the network,

22
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:07,083
it's gonna have to be
the medicine you want

23
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:08,709
with the personal they want.

24
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,041
That they want. Right.
Okay.

25
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:11,375
All right,

26
00:01:11,417 --> 00:01:15,000
as long as the medicine
is the focal point.

27
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:19,667
Oh, Lakers
season opener tonight.

28
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:21,041
You a sports fan?

29
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:22,250
Pretend we're not here.

30
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,041
Oh, sorry.

31
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:30,917
Uh, keep going?

32
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,041
Right.

33
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:38,500
Hi. Welcome to s--
wait. I'm sorry.

34
00:01:38,542 --> 00:01:40,709
Uh, should I have
some folders or something so--

35
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,917
files, make me look a little bit
more professional or--

36
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:46,208
No offense, but, uh,
no one's gonna care.

37
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,625
You're handsome

38
00:01:47,667 --> 00:01:49,291
and you have a stethoscope
hanging around your neck.

39
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:50,500
Okay. Okay.

40
00:01:50,542 --> 00:01:51,709
Whenever you're ready.

41
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,041
Great.

42
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:55,458
Okay.

43
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,583
Hi, welcome to...
Seaside health and wellness,

44
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:02,792
the practice that I started
15 years ago.

45
00:02:02,834 --> 00:02:05,375
We emphasize
collaborative medicine here.

46
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:08,959
I have the pleasure of working
with some of the most caring

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,709
and talented doctors
in their field.

48
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,041
Here's one right here.

49
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:13,291
Hey, Sam.

50
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:17,041
Funny running into you here...
In the hallway.

51
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,750
This is, uh, uh, uh,
Dr. Sheldon Wallace.

52
00:02:19,792 --> 00:02:21,750
He's one of two
of our therapists.

53
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:23,041
Why don't you tell us

54
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,875
a little bit about yourself,
Dr. Wallace?

55
00:02:25,917 --> 00:02:27,041
Um, I...

56
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:28,291
Mm-hmm.

57
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:30,000
Here we have, uh,
Jake Reilly's office.

58
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:32,041
I.v.f. Specialist.

59
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:33,709
He's also dating
your ex, right?

60
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,208
He is board certified

61
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,041
in obstetrics
and general surgery,

62
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,417
which is very rare.

63
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:42,041
Is that your friend
Dr. Wilder's office,

64
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:44,959
uh, your friend
who recently passed away?

65
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:49,041
Yes, that was, uh...
Pete's office.

66
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:50,917
He's, uh...

67
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,542
We miss him.

68
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,166
Here we have two
state-of-the-art exam rooms.

69
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:59,291
We have a family practice feel

70
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:03,041
without compromising
on cutting-edge technology.

71
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:09,667
She's gorgeous.

72
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:12,208
Can't be easy having to work
side by side with your ex.

73
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,041
Moving on, over here
we have the conference room,

74
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,250
which is,
uh, where we take care

75
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:20,041
of all
official practice business,

76
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,667
like naps.

77
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:25,625
I'm just kidding.
We don't nap in there.

78
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:28,750
Our pediatrician--
Dr. Cooper Freedman.

79
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,041
Hi. Hi.

80
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:33,041
Um, hi. Uh, i--let me
apologize up front.

81
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,041
I don't watch much
reality television.

82
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,041
I, uh, I don't see
the value in it,

83
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,583
but no offense,
of course.

84
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:39,959
Not offended.

85
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,375
No, I just, you know,
I prefer my entertainment

86
00:03:41,417 --> 00:03:43,083
to be
a little more poignant.

87
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,041
I'm sure he forgot
to tack on

88
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,458
the, uh, no offense--

89
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,083
I saw that really
powerful documentary

90
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:51,166
about the meningitis epidemic
in Africa

91
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:54,166
and about the struggle
to properly immunize children.
Africa.

92
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,583
- Did you see that?
- I did not--

93
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,000
'cause that is, like,
a passion of mine. I felt--

94
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:58,083
I shot that documentary.

95
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,291
Oh?

96
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,917
Well, part of it.
My company produced it.

97
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,667
I'm really glad
you liked it.

98
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:05,041
It's real--
it's really good work...

99
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,291
Yeah.

100
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,166
And poignant...
Poignant.

101
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,041
I think.

102
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,291
I'm gonna...
Do some work.

103
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:12,500
Okay.

104
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:13,709
Good luck.

105
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,959
That's Dr. Freedman.

106
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,041
Oh, and here we have
Dr. Charlotte king.

107
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:21,875
She is a urologist,
a sexologist,

108
00:04:21,917 --> 00:04:23,542
and, uh, my boss--
everybody's boss--

109
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,500
over at St. ambrose.

110
00:04:25,542 --> 00:04:27,125
Now let me be clear.

111
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,917
Now is not a good time
for you to be in my hospital,

112
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:32,709
but Sam asked, so you have
access to whatever you need.

113
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,291
But get in somebody's way,

114
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,667
and I will use that camera
for a shot put.

115
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,041
Nice to meet you.

116
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,875
Ha ha.

117
00:04:39,917 --> 00:04:43,417
Okay, that's all you need
to know about Charlotte king.

118
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:46,208
She's also pregnant...

119
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,959
With triplets,

120
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
which should be interesting.

121
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,375
One cream. One sugar.

122
00:04:54,417 --> 00:04:57,041
I'm sure america's sitting
on the edges of their seat

123
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,041
right now.

124
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,750
Hey.

125
00:05:00,792 --> 00:05:04,750
Cut.
She didn't sign the waiver.

126
00:05:04,792 --> 00:05:06,041
Your ass so stacks up

127
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,667
with the entire
Kardashian family.

128
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:09,041
Oh, let me guess.

129
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,667
Reality TV
is beneath you, too.

130
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:12,083
I'm just the only one
willing to say so

131
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,875
by not signing the waiver.

132
00:05:13,917 --> 00:05:15,500
I mean,
do you watch this stuff?

133
00:05:15,542 --> 00:05:17,709
"My super sweet bitchteen"?

134
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,917
"Pimp my kayak"?

135
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:21,083
Look, I did not
seek this out, all right?

136
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,041
One of my patients
is a network exec.

137
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,291
She started calling,
wouldn't stop, so I said,

138
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,291
"why not?
I can be a role model."

139
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:28,709
Just promise to give me
the heads-up

140
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,208
before the sex tape
gets leaked.

141
00:05:31,542 --> 00:05:33,583
Hey, sweetie man.

142
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,792
Mama.

143
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,500
Oh, Sam.

144
00:05:36,542 --> 00:05:37,917
It's good to see you.

145
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:39,291
Oh, my. Look at you.

146
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,208
Excellent. Mm. Mm. Mm.

147
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,583
You're looking good, baby.
I'm trying.

148
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:46,000
What's happening?

149
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:47,041
A woman likes
a little attention,

150
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,583
but do they have to be
all up in my face?

151
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,583
Mama, I told you they were
gonna be filming.

152
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,000
How's my makeup?

153
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:54,041
How's your make--
your m--you look beauti--

154
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,959
doesn't my mother
look beautiful?

155
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,458
Yes, she does.

156
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,041
Where's, uh,
Raymond and Jillian?

157
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,208
They're in the lobby.

158
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,333
Okay.

159
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:02,750
I so appreciate this, Sam.

160
00:06:02,792 --> 00:06:05,041
Stop, stop. He's your boss
and an old friend.

161
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,834
Anything I can do to help.

162
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,041
Oh.

163
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,208
Ms. Bennett.

164
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,333
Addison.

165
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:13,875
Hi. I, uh...

166
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:16,000
I had--i had no idea
you were gonna be here.

167
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:19,583
Well, I-I figured Sam
would let you know.

168
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:22,041
Oh.
Yeah, he, uh...

169
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,041
He--we aren't--
he didn't.

170
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:27,041
We don't, uh...

171
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,041
I speak with my son
quite a bit.

172
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:32,041
Right. Of course,
of course, so...

173
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:36,375
Well, it's so good
to see you, and, um...

174
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:38,500
I look forward to seeing
more of you while you're here.

175
00:06:38,542 --> 00:06:40,041
I'm sure I'm gonna
see you more before you go.

176
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:44,208
I mean, I'm not...
D-Demanding it.

177
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:50,834
So I'm gonna... go.

178
00:06:54,917 --> 00:06:56,667
What happened to that camera
that was following you around?

179
00:06:56,709 --> 00:06:58,250
Oh, I told 'em
to wait outside.

180
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:01,291
Well, Jillian was hoping
that she could tell her friends

181
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:02,500
that when she came out
to Hollywood

182
00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:03,709
and she got on a TV show.

183
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,333
No, that's what you
were hoping for.

184
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:09,041
Well, we could
make that happen.

185
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,333
Look at him, Jillian--

186
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,041
sharp suit, it fits him well.

187
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,208
I remember when you used to
visit the print shop.

188
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,458
You'd get so worked up
chasing Corinne around

189
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,041
that you had to wheeze
into an inhaler.

190
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,291
Right.

191
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:21,417
How is she?

192
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,959
She's good.
She's good.

193
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,917
Corinne is, uh,
you know, she's--

194
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,041
she's good.

195
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,667
We're proud of you.

196
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:30,041
Mm. Well...

197
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,625
All right, you just relax.

198
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:33,417
I'm gonna start
this E.K.G.

199
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:36,041
Uh, mom said you were
at the emergency room

200
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,500
a few weeks ago.

201
00:07:37,542 --> 00:07:39,667
Yeah, I was working
a few hours on the press.

202
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,041
I took a step back,

203
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,792
next thing I remember,
I was in the hospital.

204
00:07:42,834 --> 00:07:44,166
He didn't tell 'em
that he can hardly get

205
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,166
to the top of the stairs
without taking a break,

206
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:49,041
and it's been getting worse.

207
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,333
Any chest pains?

208
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:52,166
I'm 73 years old.
I got pain everywhere.

209
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,667
Okay.

210
00:07:54,917 --> 00:07:57,500
All right.
What do we got here?

211
00:07:57,542 --> 00:07:58,917
Huh.

212
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:01,041
Wh-what is it?

213
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,458
Uh, well, Raymond's E.K.G.

214
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,917
Is showing some
nonspecific abnormalities.

215
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:07,041
I'd like to get you
over to St. ambrose,

216
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,542
have them run
a couple of more tests.

217
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,500
All right? We're gonna
get to the bottom of this.

218
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:13,083
So they should be finishing up
with Raymond's tests

219
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,709
in about an hour.

220
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,917
I ordered a, uh, a chest C.T.
and an echocardiogram.

221
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:19,208
Which camera
should I be focusing on?

222
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,625
Just look at me.

223
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,208
Just--okay.

224
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,041
You seem really tight
with your mom.

225
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:28,709
Uh, yes. Uh...
She's always been there.

226
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,709
So was my mom, and I still
haven't amassed

227
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,291
the requisite hours of therapy
to move past it.

228
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:37,041
Uh, well, I just--
I admire her for, uh,

229
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,625
for all that she's done.

230
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:41,041
Like?

231
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,041
Well, she raised me.

232
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,583
Half a million people
just reached for their remotes.

233
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:48,792
Give me something
to work with, Sam.

234
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,041
You're a doctor
raised by a single mom.

235
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,333
Oh, see, that right there.

236
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:57,041
I hate that term,
"single mom."

237
00:08:57,083 --> 00:09:00,000
It implies that she, uh,
that she was something less

238
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,750
or that I missed out
on something,

239
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:03,333
and I...

240
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,041
I mean, my mother spent
way more time with me

241
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:08,208
than some kids that had a father
and a stay-at-home mom.

242
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,250
Uh, you know, she never missed
a parent-teacher meeting.

243
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:14,041
She told me she loved me
every day.

244
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,375
She popped me
in the back of my head

245
00:09:16,417 --> 00:09:20,041
whenever I needed to be popped
in the back of my head.

246
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,041
My, uh, my high school
superlatives

247
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:25,709
were class nicest
and most likely to succeed.

248
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,417
I won the Morris Grant
my second year at Georgetown,

249
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:31,667
after my mother somehow managed
to pay for the first.

250
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:33,083
I am one of

251
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:36,041
the best cardiothoracic surgeons
in the country,

252
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,375
and I'm a black man.

253
00:09:38,417 --> 00:09:41,041
So...

254
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,250
Now you know.

255
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,667
Now I know what?

256
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:48,250
Why I hate the term
"single mom."

257
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:51,041
A girl went missing
from the E.R. a few days ago.

258
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,834
There has been
a 24-hour presence here

259
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,333
ever since.

260
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:58,834
Uh, Dr. Freedman
and--and, uh, Dr. Turner

261
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,542
have been spearheading
the efforts.

262
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:01,959
Are you getting all this?

263
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,333
This is amazing.

264
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,500
Most of these people have taken
sick days to be here today.

265
00:10:05,542 --> 00:10:07,500
We launch search parties
twice a day.

266
00:10:07,542 --> 00:10:10,041
What is everyone's
connection to the little girl?

267
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,709
Uh, Sarah's my patient.

268
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,041
I've been counseling the parents
since her disappearance.

269
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:17,083
She went missing
from my E.R.

270
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,083
Uh, you should really talk
to the parents.

271
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,500
Um, we're trying to utilize,

272
00:10:20,542 --> 00:10:22,667
um, all the press
as much as possible.

273
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:26,875
Um, they are, uh, doing a-a show
about my colleague, Dr. Bennett.

274
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,792
How are you
holding it together?

275
00:10:28,834 --> 00:10:31,458
We're trying
not to think about that.

276
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,500
We want to be strong
for Sarah,

277
00:10:33,542 --> 00:10:35,041
wherever she is.

278
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,291
Don't give up, baby.

279
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,041
We're gonna find you.

280
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,917
So I've looked over
the results.

281
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:42,500
I-I should let you all
have some time.

282
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:44,041
Oh, no. You don't
have to leave, Dee.

283
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:46,041
No, they might as well
both hear

284
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:49,709
since they're gonna stop me
from enjoying myself at home

285
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:53,041
and at work.

286
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,083
Okay.

287
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,166
Well, you have
pulmonary hypertension.

288
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,834
You're throwing blood clots
into the arteries of your lungs,

289
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,875
which is raising
your blood pressure

290
00:11:00,917 --> 00:11:02,709
to a very dangerous level.

291
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,041
That's why he fainted?

292
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,000
Well, that's why
he's been having the chest pains

293
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:09,166
and why climbing stairs
feels like mount Everest.

294
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,792
What can you do?

295
00:11:10,834 --> 00:11:13,000
Well, we'll put you on
some anticoagulants,

296
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,208
which will prevent
new clots from forming.

297
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,834
Then I'll insert
a vascular umbrella

298
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,917
which will catch
the existing clots,

299
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:23,208
and hopefully prevent them
from, uh, breaking away.

300
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,750
This, hopefully,
will solve the problem.

301
00:11:25,792 --> 00:11:27,041
What if it doesn't?

302
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,333
Well, if we don't lower
your blood pressure,

303
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:33,041
your heart will overwork itself
until it fails.

304
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:36,875
This is critical.

305
00:11:36,917 --> 00:11:39,000
Um... is there, uh, uh,

306
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:41,959
oh, where's the uh,
uh, restroom?

307
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,542
Oh, right this way.

308
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,333
It's, uh, to the right.

309
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:54,041
It's over here.

310
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,959
He needs me
to be strong.

311
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,125
You will be, okay?

312
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,542
The bathroom's right here.
I'm gonna head back.

313
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:02,500
Jillian, you have
a great marriage.

314
00:12:02,542 --> 00:12:04,834
This is just
another challenge.

315
00:12:22,917 --> 00:12:24,041
Are we gonna talk about
the elephant in the room?

316
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,250
Not if I don't see one.

317
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,458
Your mother and Raymond--

318
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,667
I'm not talking
about them.

319
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:28,875
Sam, i--

320
00:12:28,917 --> 00:12:30,500
look...

321
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:33,041
Now if you want to talk
about educating kids

322
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,625
on heart health

323
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:38,458
or cutting-edge techniques
to repair congenital defects,

324
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,041
I'm your man.

325
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:44,083
But my mother's personal life
is none of your business.

326
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,041
I was glad
I got to visit

327
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,125
with Corinne today.

328
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,291
She looks good.

329
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,917
She smiled.

330
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:02,041
I didn't think I would ever
see that again.

331
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,709
Sam...

332
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,208
You did good for her.

333
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,041
You did everything
that you could.

334
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:09,750
Is that why
she won't see me?

335
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:14,000
I don't want to talk
about this, if that's okay.

336
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:21,750
Isn't that enough?

337
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:27,041
Give me this.
You have high blood pressure.

338
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:30,041
How many times do I
have to tell you--cut back?

339
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,792
We don't have to talk
about Corinne.

340
00:13:32,834 --> 00:13:36,000
But you have no call
to be nasty to me.

341
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:45,125
What you're doing
is not right, with Raymond.

342
00:13:48,542 --> 00:13:49,792
I saw you two.

343
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,500
I thought I taught you

344
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,041
not to speak on things
you don't know about.

345
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,917
He is married. He's your b-boss.
Jillian is your friend, and--

346
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,458
Sam, enough.

347
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,542
It's not right,
and you know it.

348
00:14:08,792 --> 00:14:14,041
I have worked side by side
with that man for a long time.

349
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:16,166
Things happen,

350
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,792
things you wish never did,

351
00:14:17,834 --> 00:14:20,000
but that's
for me to deal with,

352
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,667
next time you think about
keeping something to yourself

353
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:26,625
so you don't disrespect
your mother,

354
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:28,417
you should follow through
with it.

355
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,667
Thank you for dinner,

356
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:34,667
but I am not hungry.

357
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:43,041
Of course Sam has the perfect
relationship with his mother,

358
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,959
because Sam
is the perfect man.

359
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,834
I mean, he's like
a living, breathing

360
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,583
"men's health" magazine,

361
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,375
like "how to have
the perfect waist,"

362
00:14:51,417 --> 00:14:54,959
"how to make women swoon
over your bald head."

363
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,500
Hey, what is--what is he
getting paid for this?

364
00:14:59,542 --> 00:15:01,792
Nothing yet.
It's just a pilot.

365
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,000
Pilot, right.

366
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,291
But if it, uh, gets picked up,

367
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,583
he gets like $20,000
or $30,000?

368
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,041
Yeah...

369
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:09,709
An episode.

370
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,834
An episode?

371
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:15,000
For just doing what he already
normally does, he get...

372
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,250
That is insane.

373
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,875
I mean, I...

374
00:15:18,917 --> 00:15:20,250
I googled it last night--

375
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,417
the cost of raising
a child in L.A.--

376
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,041
half a million dollars.

377
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,208
And I already have one.

378
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:30,041
I'm having three more,
all at once.

379
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,208
You ever thought of, uh,
doing a show

380
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,959
about a pediatrician?

381
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,458
...is at the end
of the bar.

382
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,041
Is she still drinking?

383
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,125
Come on.

384
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,750
What was she wearing?

385
00:15:58,792 --> 00:15:59,959
It's not a hospital,
it's a zoo.

386
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,500
If I don't have
a detective in my ear,

387
00:16:01,542 --> 00:16:02,917
I got a camera in my face.

388
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,709
Oh, who invited rules magee?

389
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,041
I did.

390
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,041
Just be nice, Cooper.

391
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:08,250
James has been doing
a lot for Sarah.

392
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,875
Hey there.

393
00:16:09,917 --> 00:16:11,041
When I left the hospital,
the detectives were still there.

394
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,458
- Did they have anything?
- Nothing.

395
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,166
They're still interviewing
employees and patients

396
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,041
who may have had access.
And that's a tall order

397
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,083
given the volume
in the E.R. that night.

398
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,500
I mean,
how are Ron and Dana?

399
00:16:19,542 --> 00:16:21,083
Oh, a mess.
It's a roller coaster.

400
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,709
They were at each other's
throats before.

401
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,041
Even solid couples find it
hard to stay together

402
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,500
in the face of something
like this.

403
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:28,667
I just...
Wish I could do more.

404
00:16:28,709 --> 00:16:30,542
Short of finding Sarah...

405
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,291
Yes.

406
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:41,291
I like it. I do.

407
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,583
Okay, you look ridiculous.

408
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,000
They want me
to look ridiculous

409
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,291
so I give up
and sign the waiver.

410
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,041
What they don't know is that

411
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:49,041
I have a freakishly strong
left arm.

412
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,041
And now you sound ridiculous.

413
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:55,333
I haven't eaten enough hot dogs
to justify being at a barbecue.

414
00:16:56,875 --> 00:17:00,375
Ugh. Sam's mom hates me.

415
00:17:00,417 --> 00:17:02,959
She doesn't hate you.

416
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,625
Oh, yes, she does.
She always has.

417
00:17:04,667 --> 00:17:05,834
It doesn't help
that at graduation dinner,

418
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,625
bizzy got drunk and asked her

419
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:10,667
if "amistad" was an accurate
portrayal of slavery.

420
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,959
What--what did she say?

421
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,709
"I'll ask my slave friends."

422
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,250
I'm feeling pretty good
considering

423
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,291
you stuck something in my chest
a few days ago.

424
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:39,041
I told you
it was a simple procedure.

425
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:42,375
You're not gonna
cross Mark those steaks?

426
00:17:42,417 --> 00:17:45,583
No. It doesn't make the steaks
taste any better.

427
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:49,500
Mm. Well, something to be said
for a good-looking steak.

428
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:54,291
It's complicated.

429
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:55,709
It's not complicated
to keep the vows

430
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,875
that you made to your wife.

431
00:17:57,917 --> 00:18:01,458
It's not some fling.

432
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,458
I love Dee.

433
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,542
I don't care.

434
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,041
You think that makes me
feel any better

435
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:11,959
that you're having an affair
with my mother?

436
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:16,291
Okay... now I don't want
to embarrass her

437
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,709
and I don't want
to embarrass your wife.

438
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,709
That's the only reason
I'm not asking you

439
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,083
to get the hell outta
my house,

440
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,542
but you should get outta
of my face right now...

441
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:29,458
Just get outta my face.
Get outta my face.

442
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:39,041
Paparazzi after you again?

443
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,417
I'm sure you couldn't wait
to mug for the cameras.

444
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,041
I strike you
as that kind of guy?

445
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,083
You're an E.R. doc.

446
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:46,500
You probably drive
a tiny foreign sports car

447
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,750
or a Jeep with no doors
and a surfboard out the back,

448
00:18:49,792 --> 00:18:53,166
and tops on your bucket list
is to complete an ironman.

449
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:55,917
I only buy American, there
aren't many waves in Tennessee,

450
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:58,875
and I finished
my first ironman last year.

451
00:18:58,917 --> 00:19:02,709
You are wrong... a lot.

452
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,709
Hey, man.
You get enough to eat?

453
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,041
Yeah, stuffed.

454
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,291
All right.

455
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:16,709
Hey, Sam, why are you, uh,
why are you doing this?

456
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,709
Oh, this wasn't my idea.
It's the producer.

457
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,291
She said
she just needed an event

458
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,125
to get everybody together
in the same place.

459
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,083
No, why are you doing this,

460
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,291
the--the whole
reality show thing?

461
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,500
It doesn't really
seem like you.

462
00:19:30,542 --> 00:19:32,083
Uh...

463
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:35,542
Patients come to me
with misinformation every day.

464
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,208
This just gives me
an opportunity

465
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:41,125
to debunk unhealthy myths
that cost people their lives.

466
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,500
You know that sounds rehearsed,
right?

467
00:19:43,542 --> 00:19:45,083
Help! Someone help him!

468
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:46,917
Sam.
Raymond.

469
00:19:46,959 --> 00:19:49,125
Let's go. Let's get this.
Raymond, can you hear me?

470
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:51,834
Don't go anywhere.
Don't you go anywhere.

471
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,834
Sam, how are you feeling
right now?

472
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:56,583
Get away! Get away
or get out!

473
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,458
Sam, talk to me.

474
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,208
Charging to 360.

475
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,542
All right.
Clear.

476
00:20:03,917 --> 00:20:05,458
Oh, damn it.

477
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,041
All right,
he's still in fib.

478
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,875
We need to get him stabilized
and get him in the O.R.

479
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,250
And get rid of these clots.

480
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:11,959
I can't believe
we're getting this.

481
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Clear.

482
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,792
Come on. Come on. Come on.

483
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,583
Sinus.

484
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,041
All right. He's back.

485
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,583
Will he be okay?

486
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:28,709
I don't know. Let's go.
Come on. Get him outta here.

487
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:36,041
Sam, please, just save--
just save him. Save him.

488
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,291
All right.

489
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:38,709
- You got it?
- Yeah, yeah.

490
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,166
We cut together
some footage from the surgery.

491
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:49,250
Can you just take us through
what went wrong?

492
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,000
Yeah.

493
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,875
Okay, I had already...

494
00:20:52,917 --> 00:20:56,417
Already removed
the major obstruction.

495
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,208
Uh, I saw an opportunity

496
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,041
to get some of the other
accumulated blood clots.

497
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,291
What did you say there?

498
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:06,834
That I needed a differential
v.Q. Scan, uh, post-surgery.

499
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:10,417
I was concerned about
Raymond's lung function,

500
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:11,834
uh, going forward.

501
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:14,125
At this point,
we were ready to close.

502
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:16,625
Okay, here is when he started
to bleed into his chest.

503
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:19,542
The anticoagulants
had made it difficult

504
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,625
for his blood to clot.

505
00:21:21,667 --> 00:21:22,959
Uh, I don't know.

506
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,875
I guess maybe I kept him
open too long.

507
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:27,875
I thought I could do more.

508
00:21:27,917 --> 00:21:30,041
What did the doctor
say there?

509
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,041
That if we didn't stop
the bleeding,

510
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,709
Raymond would die.

511
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,083
And what were you thinking?

512
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:38,291
Uh, that if I didn't stop
the bleeding,

513
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:41,166
Raymond would die.

514
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:43,583
Medicine is a science,
but it's also personal.

515
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,750
As doctors, we want to believe

516
00:21:45,792 --> 00:21:47,375
that no matter
who's on that table,

517
00:21:47,417 --> 00:21:50,291
we provide the same care,
but it's just not true.

518
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,041
I'm not saying that,
as doctors,

519
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:54,083
we don't provide
quality care to everyone,

520
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:57,041
but maybe with--
with some patients,

521
00:21:57,083 --> 00:22:01,166
we--we do a little more,
we--we fight a little harder.

522
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:02,500
And in those cases,

523
00:22:02,542 --> 00:22:05,041
when we don't get
the--the results we want,

524
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:07,125
it hurts.

525
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:09,917
But when we do, it's, uh...

526
00:22:09,959 --> 00:22:14,000
It's tough
to beat that feeling.

527
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,917
You need a new lung,
Raymond.

528
00:22:18,959 --> 00:22:21,000
You can get him
on the list, right?

529
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:22,417
I-Isn't there a list?

530
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:24,583
Yes, but people usually
end up dying

531
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,792
waiting for a match, and that's
over the course of years.

532
00:22:26,834 --> 00:22:28,417
Raymond doesn't have
that kind of time.

533
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:30,375
We'll find it.
We'll find a lung.

534
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:31,917
No, he'll be fine.

535
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:33,083
We should start considering

536
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:35,083
living related donor
transplant.

537
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:37,625
We take a lobe
from a relative,

538
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:40,041
and then replace
the damaged lung with that.

539
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:43,000
We should get as many people
tested as we can.

540
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:44,375
Who do you ask
for a lung?

541
00:22:44,417 --> 00:22:46,625
I know you and Jillian
don't have any children.

542
00:22:46,667 --> 00:22:49,041
How about siblings,
nieces, nephews?

543
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:51,417
No, no, no.

544
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:53,458
I guess that's it.

545
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,041
I just go home
and wait to die.

546
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,458
You are not giving up.

547
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,000
Oh, what choice do I have?

548
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:00,041
We need to pray.

549
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:03,417
Pray?

550
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:06,041
You want me to get down
on my knees

551
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:08,041
and pray for a miracle?

552
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:10,792
You tell me
why I should do that

553
00:23:10,834 --> 00:23:13,291
when you both know
there's another option.

554
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:15,041
Sam...

555
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:17,375
You need to get tested.

556
00:23:17,417 --> 00:23:18,917
If you're a match,

557
00:23:18,959 --> 00:23:22,959
you can save
your father's life.

558
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:33,208
Sam is level-headed.

559
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,583
Sam has a...

560
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:38,041
An above-average
sense of humor.

561
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:40,875
Interesting fact, Sam--

562
00:23:40,917 --> 00:23:42,041
Forget the camera,

563
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:44,291
lose the cards,
and just talk.

564
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:47,041
What do you think
when you think of Sam Bennett?

565
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:48,709
Uh...

566
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,542
Uh, honesty.

567
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:52,417
Can you elaborate?

568
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:55,041
Well, the...

569
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:56,875
The truth means a lot to Sam,

570
00:23:56,917 --> 00:23:59,750
maybe... more than
anything else.

571
00:23:59,792 --> 00:24:02,875
And, um, that's
an admirable quality

572
00:24:02,917 --> 00:24:05,041
for a doctor,
for anyone, really.

573
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:07,041
And, uh...

574
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:09,542
Sam has a rigid set
of beliefs,

575
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:12,041
and his honesty--
the honesty he inspires--

576
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:14,834
allows him to
stick to those beliefs,

577
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:16,750
and I...

578
00:24:16,792 --> 00:24:19,709
I admire that about him.

579
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,083
You know, his passion to help

580
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:23,667
and his passion for the truth.

581
00:24:23,709 --> 00:24:26,041
Yeah.

582
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:27,625
You knew?

583
00:24:28,959 --> 00:24:31,917
That Sam is your son

584
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:36,041
or that you've been having
an affair for 40 years?

585
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:37,792
How was I gonna say anything

586
00:24:37,834 --> 00:24:39,917
when she gave you
something I couldn't?

587
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:42,875
Jillian, I'm so sorry.
I never meant for it to--

588
00:24:42,917 --> 00:24:45,458
meant for--for it to happen,
to hurt me, what?

589
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,500
Sam. No, sweetie.

590
00:24:47,542 --> 00:24:49,041
Sweetie, let... come back.

591
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:50,125
Mom.

592
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:52,041
Sw--just, sweet--
come here, Sam.

593
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:53,917
I don't owe you
any courtesies right now.
Please.

594
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:55,041
Sam.

595
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:56,125
You lied to me.

596
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:58,291
What's the right way
to tell your children

597
00:24:58,333 --> 00:25:01,750
that their father's married
to another woman?

598
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:04,041
Sam.

599
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:05,125
Move.

600
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:06,750
Move!

601
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:10,125
Okay, t-t-tell me what--

602
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:11,750
tell me what you said.
W--

603
00:25:11,792 --> 00:25:14,000
tell me what you said
about my father.

604
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:15,041
Sam--

605
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:16,166
tell me what you said!

606
00:25:16,208 --> 00:25:18,041
I-I said that--
that he walked out on us

607
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,792
and that I didn't know
where he was,

608
00:25:19,834 --> 00:25:21,542
and if he wanted to be here,
he would be here.

609
00:25:21,583 --> 00:25:23,083
He would be here.
You lied.
W--

610
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:24,959
no! You lied!

611
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I lied. As a parent,
you make decisions.

612
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:31,041
Why did you even
bring him here?

613
00:25:31,083 --> 00:25:32,667
Because Jillian wanted
the best,

614
00:25:32,709 --> 00:25:35,208
and--and I couldn't tell her
why that was a bad idea.

615
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:37,041
You're sleeping
with her husband,

616
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:39,041
now you're worried
about her feelings?

617
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:41,625
You should've been giving me
the same consideration.

618
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:44,041
Clearly,
I have made mistakes.

619
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:46,458
This isn't
a perfect situation,

620
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,667
but, Sam, there's
no bad people here, just...

621
00:25:48,709 --> 00:25:51,041
Ah!
Just people that made
bad choices.

622
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:53,667
And he's supported us
when we needed support.

623
00:25:53,709 --> 00:25:56,041
What--what--what did you say?
What is that supposed to mean?

624
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:59,250
There were times...

625
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,375
You had your heart set
on Georgetown--

626
00:26:01,417 --> 00:26:03,166
no. No.

627
00:26:03,208 --> 00:26:05,166
I never asked anything
from anyone--

628
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:06,875
not you,
especially not him.

629
00:26:06,917 --> 00:26:08,041
I'm sorry.

630
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:10,291
Will you stop saying
you're sorry?!

631
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:13,000
That's not good enough...

632
00:26:13,041 --> 00:26:14,917
And you know it.

633
00:26:14,959 --> 00:26:17,917
Oh. Get out of my face.

634
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,417
Sam and I didn't care much for
one another in the beginning.

635
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:26,625
I thought he was arrogant,

636
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:28,041
and he thought I was a bitch.

637
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:31,250
Turns out only one
of those things is true.

638
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:34,250
I learned along the way
that if you didn't like Sam,

639
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:37,041
it probably meant there was
something wrong with you.

640
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,834
For 40 years,

641
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:43,500
he, uh, he was
my mother's boss,

642
00:26:43,542 --> 00:26:46,417
and... you know,
I liked him, sure.

643
00:26:46,458 --> 00:26:48,250
But now...

644
00:26:48,291 --> 00:26:50,500
But now he's
suppose to have some...

645
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:53,041
Special significance?

to be upset,

But, Sam, you are who you are
no matter who your father is.

654
00:27:14,625 --> 00:27:17,250
And the choices that they made,
they don't define you.

And maybe
when the shock wears off,

No, don't do that.

Don't. You don't

You can be angry.

You can keep looking at me

but you need
to say something.

677
00:28:26,291 --> 00:28:28,166
Why?

678
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:34,333
In the beginning,
I asked myself that a lot.

679
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:39,041
Why... was I sleeping
with a married man?

680
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:41,667
Why did I fall in love
with him?

681
00:28:41,709 --> 00:28:43,667
Why won't he leave her?

682
00:28:43,709 --> 00:28:46,709
Do I want him to?

683
00:28:49,458 --> 00:28:51,166
After you were born,
I told him

684
00:28:51,208 --> 00:28:53,083
that if he wanted
to be in your life,

685
00:28:53,125 --> 00:28:56,000
it was gonna be
as your father.

686
00:28:56,041 --> 00:28:59,291
We had to be a family.

687
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:02,041
But it was a different time
back then.

688
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:06,041
Divorce was a big deal.

689
00:29:06,083 --> 00:29:09,041
Even if you were cheating
on your wife,

690
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:11,041
you stayed.

691
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:14,041
It was the noble thing
to do.

692
00:29:14,083 --> 00:29:16,208
He did the noble thing.

693
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:19,875
So I moved on.

694
00:29:19,917 --> 00:29:22,625
I started seeing
other people.

695
00:29:22,667 --> 00:29:27,792
But I never
stopped thinking about him...

696
00:29:30,166 --> 00:29:35,041
The way he would look at me
from across the shop...

697
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:37,333
That feeling.

698
00:29:40,917 --> 00:29:43,750
And then there was Corinne.

699
00:29:43,792 --> 00:29:46,041
I had this family.

700
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:48,458
It wasn't perfect
by anybody else's standards,

701
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,875
but it was beautiful,

702
00:29:50,917 --> 00:29:53,500
so beautiful.

703
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:56,041
I don't know when I...

704
00:29:56,083 --> 00:29:58,041
Decided he was gonna be
the only man in my life,

705
00:29:58,083 --> 00:30:01,333
but I must have.

706
00:30:03,417 --> 00:30:06,083
After a while, you stop
asking yourself why

707
00:30:06,125 --> 00:30:11,709
because there is no answer
that makes sense.

708
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,875
It's just...

709
00:30:13,917 --> 00:30:16,291
It is. It's...

710
00:30:16,333 --> 00:30:19,500
It's just the life
you have.

711
00:30:23,709 --> 00:30:27,041
It's not fair.

712
00:30:27,083 --> 00:30:29,166
You made all the sacrifices.

713
00:30:29,208 --> 00:30:32,709
No, he gave me you
and Corinne,

714
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:35,500
and he never got to love
you guys the way that I did.

715
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,041
That was his choice.

716
00:30:37,083 --> 00:30:39,500
It doesn't mean
it was easy.

717
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:44,542
You shoulda told me.

718
00:30:50,792 --> 00:30:53,041
Remember when we used
to go over to Raymond's

719
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:56,000
for those barbecues
on Memorial Day?

720
00:30:57,875 --> 00:30:59,208
One time he introduced you

721
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:03,166
to this friend of his
who was a doctor.

722
00:31:03,208 --> 00:31:06,333
You asked him so many questions
that at one point,

723
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:09,208
he locked himself
in the bathroom.

724
00:31:10,417 --> 00:31:11,792
A few days later,

725
00:31:11,834 --> 00:31:15,041
I gave you that yellow and blue
toy stethoscope.

726
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:18,667
And Corinne had the most
well-monitored heart

727
00:31:18,709 --> 00:31:20,041
in the world.

728
00:31:22,083 --> 00:31:25,000
I didn't give you that, Sam.

729
00:31:27,792 --> 00:31:31,709
Every time you played with it,
I wanted to tell you...

730
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,458
Where it was from.

731
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,000
I'm sorry.

732
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:38,709
I know it's not enough.

733
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:41,750
But I am so sorry.

734
00:31:55,875 --> 00:31:58,000
I'll go make us
something to eat.

735
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:12,041
We were pretty sure
you were awol.

736
00:32:12,083 --> 00:32:14,041
Well, I made a commitment to--
to shoot this thing, so--

737
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:17,875
I'm sorry about, uh,
your camera, by the way.

738
00:32:17,917 --> 00:32:19,041
Don't sweat it.

739
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:21,417
We budget for a busted one
on every shoot.

740
00:32:21,458 --> 00:32:23,208
Did you just get a physical?

741
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,625
Uh, no.

742
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:27,458
Give blood?

743
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,875
It's my job to play dumb.

744
00:32:28,917 --> 00:32:30,041
Oh, right.

745
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:33,417
Uh, yes, I, uh, I, uh,
got tested

746
00:32:33,458 --> 00:32:36,417
to see if I could be
a donor for Raymond.

747
00:32:36,458 --> 00:32:39,041
How did you come
to that decision?

748
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:40,083
I don't know. I just--

749
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,917
I came to work
and I got tested.

750
00:32:42,959 --> 00:32:45,625
What are you gonna do
if you're a match?

751
00:32:48,083 --> 00:32:50,000
I don't know.

752
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,792
I don't know.

753
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,750
What made you
change your mind?

754
00:32:57,792 --> 00:32:59,250
This isn't about me.

755
00:32:59,291 --> 00:33:02,583
Sam was there for me
when I really just...

756
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:06,041
Needed somebody
to let me breathe.

757
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:10,250
Jared Watson, Rachel zucker,
ed diamanti.

758
00:33:10,291 --> 00:33:12,041
Who are those people?

759
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:14,750
Sam saved them,
all of them.

760
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:16,125
Not to mention the nine months

761
00:33:16,166 --> 00:33:17,959
that he was able to give
Pete Wilder.

762
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I mean, I'm sure that Sam
signed up for all of this

763
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:24,208
because he thought, deep down,
that he was doing good.

764
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:26,625
And I'm sure that
you all are salivating

765
00:33:26,667 --> 00:33:30,166
because his life went from Oprah
to springer overnight, but...

766
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:32,625
Sam's a great doctor.

767
00:33:32,667 --> 00:33:34,041
And he has spent
his entire career

768
00:33:34,083 --> 00:33:35,375
building a reputation.

769
00:33:35,417 --> 00:33:37,125
He does not deserve
to lose that

770
00:33:37,166 --> 00:33:38,959
when all he did
was get blindsided

771
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,041
by a truckload of suck.

772
00:33:41,083 --> 00:33:43,125
He deserves better.

773
00:33:43,166 --> 00:33:46,166
I wanted you to know that.

774
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:12,041
I would be here
without you.

775
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:16,041
You have nothing to do
with the man that I've become.

776
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:18,709
If you've laid awake
at night

777
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:21,000
proud of how I've turned out,

778
00:34:21,041 --> 00:34:22,166
you shouldn't have.

779
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:26,041
I am who I am
because of my mother.

780
00:34:26,083 --> 00:34:29,250
She raised a doctor,
a father,

781
00:34:29,291 --> 00:34:31,917
a grandfather,

782
00:34:31,959 --> 00:34:34,041
a brother who would do
anything for his sister.

783
00:34:34,083 --> 00:34:36,667
My mother raised a man...

784
00:34:36,709 --> 00:34:38,667
A real man.

785
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:40,917
So...

786
00:34:40,959 --> 00:34:43,291
I would be here
without you.

787
00:34:46,625 --> 00:34:48,417
I got tested.

788
00:34:48,458 --> 00:34:49,667
I'm a match.

789
00:34:49,709 --> 00:34:53,917
And I could donate
part of my lobe to you

790
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:56,750
and I will
if that's what you want,

791
00:34:56,792 --> 00:34:58,750
because no matter how little
I know you,

792
00:34:58,792 --> 00:35:02,333
that's the kind of man
my mother raised.

793
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,458
You were so excited
when you got the lead

794
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,041
in that fourth grade play.

795
00:35:20,083 --> 00:35:22,041
Dee didn't want me to come,
but I snuck in anyway,

796
00:35:22,083 --> 00:35:23,709
and I stood in the back

797
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:26,000
and I just smiled.

798
00:35:28,083 --> 00:35:30,041
It was hard not to...

799
00:35:30,083 --> 00:35:33,291
Cheer or wave.

800
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:34,917
Hard not to let anybody know

801
00:35:34,959 --> 00:35:39,166
why I was just
standing there... smiling.

802
00:35:42,625 --> 00:35:46,291
I saw Dee
on the front row with Corinne,

803
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:48,083
and I wondered
what it would be like

804
00:35:48,125 --> 00:35:53,333
if my place in life was sitting
next to them watching you.

805
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:57,417
But that's...
Not the life I chose.

806
00:36:01,083 --> 00:36:03,750
I'm not asking you
for sympathy.

807
00:36:03,792 --> 00:36:08,542
And I won't let you take
a piece of yourself to save me.

808
00:36:10,041 --> 00:36:13,917
But you can't take away
how proud I am of you...

809
00:36:13,959 --> 00:36:17,542
Or how proud I am

810
00:36:17,583 --> 00:36:20,000
of who you turned out
to be...

811
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,208
Even if it's in spite of me.

812
00:36:27,667 --> 00:36:30,041
I'm ready to go.

813
00:36:32,083 --> 00:36:34,583
I should go home.

814
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:44,166
Oh.

815
00:36:44,208 --> 00:36:45,583
Sam.

816
00:36:45,625 --> 00:36:47,041
Hey.

817
00:36:47,083 --> 00:36:50,000
I wanted to thank you
for everything you've done

818
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,458
for Raymond.

819
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,041
And I wanted to apologize.

820
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:55,208
You don't have to
apologize to me.

821
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:58,542
Oh, I put you on the spot.
I asked you to get tested.

822
00:36:58,583 --> 00:36:59,959
I shouldn't have done that.

823
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,041
No, you were just trying
to save your husband.

824
00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:05,041
I am not
the only victim here.

825
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:09,834
Um...

826
00:37:09,875 --> 00:37:12,709
I made the choice
to stay.

827
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:15,709
I made the choice
to not hate Dee.

828
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:19,125
I made the choice
not to lose my husband.

829
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:24,458
That might make me a fool,
but...

830
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,250
I'm not a victim.

831
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:31,000
I'm gonna be
taking Raymond home.

832
00:37:36,625 --> 00:37:38,834
Hey, listen,

833
00:37:38,875 --> 00:37:41,041
I-I know this is Sam's thing,
but, uh, I-I was wondering

834
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:45,041
if you had any contacts
with any national news programs.

835
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:47,750
It's, uh, it--it's--
it's Sarah.

836
00:37:47,792 --> 00:37:50,041
We--we got a-a ton
of local coverage,

837
00:37:50,083 --> 00:37:52,500
but it's starting to wane,
and that--that sucks.

838
00:37:52,542 --> 00:37:54,500
The community is losing steam,

839
00:37:54,542 --> 00:37:56,291
and I thought making this
a national story

840
00:37:56,333 --> 00:37:58,542
would give us the--the boost
we need.

841
00:37:58,583 --> 00:38:01,583
I'll make a few calls.

842
00:38:01,625 --> 00:38:03,917
You're really invested
in this case.

843
00:38:03,959 --> 00:38:06,041
Well, how could I not be?

844
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:08,750
I mean, Ron and Dana, their--
their little girl is missing.

845
00:38:08,792 --> 00:38:13,125
I'm with them every day.
I see what it's doing to them.

846
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:16,792
We saw you
in your husband's office.

847
00:38:19,125 --> 00:38:20,709
W--

848
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:23,542
I eat breakfast there.

849
00:38:23,583 --> 00:38:26,792
Not all the time.
Just when I need...

850
00:38:28,291 --> 00:38:31,875
Pete had this... favorite set
of sheets that I hated,

851
00:38:31,917 --> 00:38:35,667
and now I can't sleep
without them.

852
00:38:35,709 --> 00:38:38,458
I wear his sweater at home.

853
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,041
I mean,
I'd wear it all the time

854
00:38:40,083 --> 00:38:41,500
except I'm afraid
that people would think

855
00:38:41,542 --> 00:38:45,500
I was the freak who wears
her dead husband's clothes.

856
00:38:48,208 --> 00:38:50,041
I know that Pete
is not coming back.

857
00:38:50,083 --> 00:38:52,959
I know that every day...

858
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,291
I am getting closer to knowing
who I am without him.

859
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,375
But Ron and Dana, they're--

860
00:38:57,417 --> 00:38:59,834
I mean,
they're--they're stuck.

861
00:38:59,875 --> 00:39:01,917
They're stuck in this place
where they don't know.

862
00:39:01,959 --> 00:39:07,041
And they can't move forward
until they do.

863
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:09,500
Do you think Sarah
is alive?

864
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:13,625
I hope so.

865
00:39:13,667 --> 00:39:15,542

00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:16,041
I'm never gonna let her
out of my sight.

885
00:40:16,083 --> 00:40:20,041
We're gonna be
a family again.

886
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:22,041
Yeah.

887
00:40:22,083 --> 00:40:25,000
♪ What's left here
is a fragile love ♪

888
00:40:25,041 --> 00:40:27,250
How did you sleep last night?

889
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:28,917
Uh, I didn't.

890
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:31,041
Why not?

891
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:33,000
Are you for real?

892
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:38,041
Why is it that
whenever you can't sleep

893
00:40:38,083 --> 00:40:41,041
you always manage
to come across these channels

894
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:44,041
that you never knew existed?

895
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:47,750
I was watching this show
last night about this guy

896
00:40:47,792 --> 00:40:51,667
that gets dropped in the middle
of the Sahara,

897
00:40:51,709 --> 00:40:54,041
and all they leave him with
is, uh,

898
00:40:54,083 --> 00:40:58,750
like, some rope, some flint,
and some kidney beans

899
00:40:58,792 --> 00:41:00,375
or whatever.

900
00:41:00,417 --> 00:41:02,208
And, uh...

901
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:05,291
And he has to survive.

902
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:08,000
And I'm watching this show,
and--and I'm thinking,

903
00:41:08,041 --> 00:41:09,458
ah...

904
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,917
Just how cool
that must be...

905
00:41:12,959 --> 00:41:14,083
To have to do that,

906
00:41:14,125 --> 00:41:16,583
to--to just lose yourself.

907
00:41:19,583 --> 00:41:22,750
You know
I've never left the country?

908
00:41:22,792 --> 00:41:26,041
Never surprised anyone.

909
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:28,041
I haven't found my one yet.

910
00:41:28,083 --> 00:41:31,792
I mean, I'm not sure
I've really tried.

911
00:41:31,834 --> 00:41:35,041
And I mean, like,
really, really tried...

912
00:41:35,083 --> 00:41:37,041
You know?

913
00:41:37,083 --> 00:41:40,834
My identity has always been
my kid,

914
00:41:40,875 --> 00:41:43,041
my grandkid,

915
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:46,041
my mother, Corinne,

916
00:41:46,083 --> 00:41:49,083
and my friends.

917
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:52,709
You know, it's been enough
up until now.

918
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:55,125
But...

919
00:41:55,166 --> 00:41:58,500
What's next?

920
00:41:58,542 --> 00:42:00,375
I mean, I thought
it would be this thing,

921
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:05,125
you know, this show, net--
network pilot thing.

922
00:42:05,166 --> 00:42:08,250
I thought that was...

923
00:42:08,291 --> 00:42:12,041
What I was looking for,
but...

924
00:42:12,083 --> 00:42:14,000
I don't know.

925
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:18,792
I don't really know...

926
00:42:18,834 --> 00:42:22,166
What I'm looking for.
