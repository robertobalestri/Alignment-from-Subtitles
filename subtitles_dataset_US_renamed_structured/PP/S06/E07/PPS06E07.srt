00:00:08,083 --> 00:00:10,041
Addison?
Sweetheart, open the door.

3
00:00:10,083 --> 00:00:11,583
No, I'm fine. Thanks.

4
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:13,166
Open the door
so we can talk.

5
00:00:13,208 --> 00:00:14,583
Oh.

6
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:16,959
Talking.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,041
Talking is so overrated.

8
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:21,083
No, it's okay. I'm fine.
Thanks. Go away.

9
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:23,375
We can, uh, you know,
talk later.

10
00:00:23,417 --> 00:00:26,041
Addison, I don't--i don't want
you to feel embarrassed.

11
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:28,041
No, it's okay.
Clearly, I had it coming.

12
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:30,041
I did the same thing to Sam
when he proposed to me,

13
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:32,208
so karmically, you know,
I mean, Karma...

14
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,041
Is so awesome.

15
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:36,667
I-I didn't say no.

16
00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:39,041
You didn't say anything,
which is... fine.

17
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:41,166
It's fine. It's fine.
It's fine. It's fine.

18
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,458
Because now i'm...

19
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,834
Locked in the bathroom
like a crazy person,

20
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:47,625
which I'm sure makes me
so attractive to you.

21
00:00:47,667 --> 00:00:51,208
You want me so badly right now,
I'm betting.

22
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,333
I love you.

23
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:54,792
I love you--the brilliant,

24
00:00:54,834 --> 00:00:56,208
the stunning, the bitchy,

25
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,709
the crazy in the morning,
in the afternoon, 3:00 P.M.--

26
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,583
okay, just stop.
Don't say anymore.

27
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:02,875
All right? 'Cause you say
these nice things,

28
00:01:02,917 --> 00:01:05,041
and it just makes me
more in love with you

29
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:07,041
and that just makes me
want to marry you more,

30
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:09,041
which isn't helping,
because I just proposed to you,

31
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:11,000
and you didn't say yes.

32
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:14,041
Or no. I-I didn't say no.

33
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:16,709
Baby, just open the door,
please.

34
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,500
I am in this. All right?

35
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:27,083
No questions,
no reservations.

36
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:29,041
Do you not want
to get married?
It's not that.

37
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:30,917
It's just--
it's a big step.

38
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:33,625
The biggest step. And I...

39
00:01:33,667 --> 00:01:35,041
I want us to be ready.

40
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:36,458
So that's a no?

41
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,875
It's not a no.
It's just a...

42
00:01:38,917 --> 00:01:40,041
Not right now.

43
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:44,208
You're gonna lock yourself
in the bathroom again.

44
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,041
Okay, well, I'm gonna be
right outside here,

45
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:48,709
on the other side of the door.

46
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,750
Right here. I'm not--
I'm not going anywhere.

47
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,500
I'm gonna be right here.

48
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:11,083
So what's new?

49
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:13,792
That was pretty big,
don't you think?

50
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:17,500
I don't want to talk about it.
Not with you.

51
00:02:17,542 --> 00:02:19,709
I don't think that's true.

52
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,500
I mean, you're here,
in our spot.

53
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:23,583
You know if you come,
I'll show up.

54
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,709
Don't give me the look.

55
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,542
I'm only here
because you want me to be here.

56
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,500
It's been a while
since we caught up.

57
00:02:30,542 --> 00:02:32,750
I've been busy.

58
00:02:32,792 --> 00:02:34,125
I know.

59
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:36,208
It's good.

60
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,709
You're happy.

61
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:42,000
I want you to be happy.

62
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:45,125
I want you
to forget about me.

63
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:48,333
That's never gonna happen.

64
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:02,709
So here is the thing--

65
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:07,041
I didn't say no.
I'm still thinking about it.

66
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:08,083
What did I say?

67
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:09,583
To never mention it again.

68
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,792
To never mention it again.

69
00:03:11,834 --> 00:03:13,333
Addison--
never mention it again.

70
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:16,125
Please, sweetie.
Everything's normal.

71
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:18,000
It never happened.

72
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,041
Okay. So what's the thing?

73
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,208
Oh, Mildred,
the social worker.

74
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,792
I told her about
our status change.

75
00:03:23,834 --> 00:03:24,792
What?

76
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:26,792
The move, that you moved in.

77
00:03:26,834 --> 00:03:29,667
So she needs to meet with you
before the hearing,

78
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,667
because until Henry is
officially mine,

79
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:33,667
you know, by law, I have
to update her every time--

80
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:36,250
a new guy moves in?

81
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:37,375
Of course I will meet
with Mildred.

82
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:39,000
Yeah?
You're okay with that?

83
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,417
Hey. I love Henry.
I love you. I'm okay.

84
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:42,625
Are we okay?

85
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:45,166
Absolutely. You love Henry.

86
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:46,792
You love me.

87
00:03:46,834 --> 00:03:48,875
I love you.

88
00:03:48,917 --> 00:03:50,458
We're good.

89
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,041
Have either of you
been sleeping?

90
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,917
Not me.

91
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,458
Not since Sarah went missing.

92
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,041
But Dana...

93
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,000
The pills help, I think.

94
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,125
Dana?

95
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,625
Yeah.

96
00:04:18,667 --> 00:04:20,500
They do.

97
00:04:20,542 --> 00:04:23,667
They help me.
And when I sleep,

98
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:25,542
Sarah's there, smiling.

99
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:28,709
Sometimes
I can even hear her.

100
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:32,125
Well, it's been about
six weeks,

101
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,667
and I wonder if...

102
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:37,667
Perhaps we should consider
weaning you off the pills.

103
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:39,875
I don't think
that's a good idea.

104
00:04:39,917 --> 00:04:42,041
I'm worried that she's becoming
too dependent on them.

105
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,125
So what?
What's wrong with that?

106
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:45,417
This medication
can be addictive.

107
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:46,792
It's not meant
for long-term use,

108
00:04:46,834 --> 00:04:49,000
and I think it's having
a-a numbing effect on Dana.

109
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,959
That's the point.
You want her to feel this?

110
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,667
She can't feel this,

111
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,542
because I'm feeling this,

112
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,041
and I gotta tell you,

113
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,291
that if one of us didn't need
to be conscious,

114
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,041
if one of us didn't need
to talk to the cops

115
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,709
or make a public plea,
if we could both be numb--

116
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,041
I would be taking anything
to not feel this.

117
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,041
You can't take away her pills.

118
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,333
Ron--
no. No. No.

119
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,750
She falls asleep,
and for a couple of hours,

120
00:05:08,792 --> 00:05:11,166
it's okay.

121
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:15,166
But then she wakes up,
and...

122
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:18,709
This nightmare that we're living
is back.

123
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,041
She starts to scream

124
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,792
because we don't know
where our baby is.

125
00:05:23,834 --> 00:05:25,333
I cry.

126
00:05:26,792 --> 00:05:30,667
When I wake up, it hits me
again, and I cry.

127
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,750
He holds me.

128
00:05:37,542 --> 00:05:40,709
He's been good to me.

129
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,291
He's there.

130
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:46,583
So you're leaning
on each other.

131
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,333
In the face of this tragedy,

132
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:53,000
your reconciliation, it...

133
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,792
It's a positive.

134
00:05:59,834 --> 00:06:01,208
I can't believe it.
You're sure?

135
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,041
I'm sure.

136
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:04,750
Well, maybe fifth time's
the charm.

137
00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:06,750
Oh, it's early yet,
but I'm confident.

138
00:06:06,792 --> 00:06:08,750
Just remember to take it easy
and stay calm.

139
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:10,625
That's--that's so important.
And you call me

140
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:12,166
if you're worried about
anything, all right?

141
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,792
Oh, I can't wait
to call Danny.

142
00:06:13,834 --> 00:06:15,667
He's at a conference
in Hong Kong,

143
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,750
but he's gonna be
so thrilled.

144
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:19,792
Thank you, Dr. Reilly.
Sure.

145
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:26,458
Uh, Megan, you remember
Dr. Montgomery.

146
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,625
Of course.

147
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:29,291
Um, your boyfriend's
a genius.

148
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,583
Mm.
I'm pregnant again.

149
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:32,667
Congratulations.

150
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:34,792
Thanks again, Dr. Reilly.

151
00:06:34,834 --> 00:06:36,542
Sure.

152
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,792
Now listen,
I-I did tell Megan

153
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:42,834
that it might be time
to consider other options.

154
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,000
Ahem.

155
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,667
I did, but she begged me

156
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:49,583
to try at least one more time,
so...

157
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:50,792
Addison.

158
00:06:50,834 --> 00:06:52,875
Mm?
I did not say anything.

159
00:06:52,917 --> 00:06:54,041
We agreed to disagree.

160
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,041
Your patient...

161
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,458
Your practice,

162
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,208
your prerogative.

163
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:12,500
Ah.

164
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,750
Dr. Shepherd.

165
00:07:16,792 --> 00:07:17,875
Dr. Peterson.

166
00:07:17,917 --> 00:07:19,458
So glad you could join me.

167
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,709
Oh. That's yours?

168
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,208
I forgot my orange soda.

169
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,667
You can only get it in
the vending machine up on four.

170
00:07:28,667 --> 00:07:30,834
Busy day?
About normal.

171
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:33,041
Me? I had 12 patients--

172
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,041
all emergent,
all within a half-hour.

173
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,500
It was crazy.

174
00:07:36,542 --> 00:07:38,667
Reminded me of when I used to
wait tables back in the day.

175
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:39,875
Mm.

176
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,041
This is nice.

177
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,542
What is?
You and I
having lunch together.

178
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:47,875
Not together.

179
00:07:47,917 --> 00:07:49,500
You are eating lunch.

180
00:07:49,542 --> 00:07:51,959
I'm eating lunch. We happen to
be doing that at the same table,

181
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,333
so, you know, not a date.

182
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,291
Of course it's not a date.

183
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,166
If it were,
you'd be enjoying yourself.

184
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,083
We'd be having
a picnic on the beach--

185
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:01,291
I don't like sand in my food.

186
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,000
Which is why the mountains
are ideal.

187
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,875
We could have dinner
in front of the fireplace

188
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,083
at some historic lodge--

189
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:08,333
air is too thin
in the mountains.

190
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:09,542
Hard to breathe.
Doesn't sound like much fun.

191
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:13,041
Not compared to
the happiest place on earth.

192
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,625
How about Disneyland?

193
00:08:14,667 --> 00:08:15,750
How about we eat
at the same table,

194
00:08:15,792 --> 00:08:18,000
not together, in silence?

195
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,792
Um, you should know--
dude, silence.

196
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:24,500
Right. Don't call me "dude."

197
00:08:24,542 --> 00:08:26,041
And there's ketchup
on your face.

198
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,792
What, tomorrow? I thought
it would take Mildred

199
00:08:37,834 --> 00:08:39,709
at least a week
to set the appointment up.

200
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,083
It's fine.
I know what to say.
So what are you gonna say

201
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,333
when she asks you
about you and Henry?

202
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,125
I'll explain that I only
give him glass and knives

203
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:48,041
to play with when I leave him
alone for hours on end.
Jake.

204
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,375
Stop worrying.

205
00:08:49,417 --> 00:08:52,041
Isn't that Angela?

206
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,583
Hi!

207
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,542
Hey, honey. Wow.
What a nice surprise.

208
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,583
Yeah. Addison, hi.
Hi.

209
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,041
Now wait a second.

210
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,041
Shouldn't you, uh,
shouldn't you be studying?

211
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:03,166
Dean's list every semester.

212
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:06,041
Are you seeing, um...
Yes. My boyfriend wanted
to see it, so...

213
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,041
Oh, Ethan's here?
No. I moved on.

214
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,375
What'd he do?

215
00:09:09,417 --> 00:09:11,208
It's less of what did
and more of what he was--

216
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,375
a total jerk, you know,
stupid frat boy.

217
00:09:14,417 --> 00:09:15,625
I'm way too good for that.

218
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:16,667
Yeah, you are.

219
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:17,792
Hey. Baby.

220
00:09:17,834 --> 00:09:19,709
Hey.

221
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,250
Hi. I'm--I'm Addison.

222
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:26,000
Addison, yes.
I'm Eli Wilson.

223
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,792
Yeah. This is Jake.

224
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:29,917
How you doing?

225
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:32,041
Dr. Jake Reilly,
Angela's father.

226
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,709
Of course. Angela's told me
so much about you.

227
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,041
I'm in awe of m.D.S.

228
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:39,041
I'm a doctor, but I'm a phd.
It's not the same.

229
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,041
No.

230
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,834
So you teach?

231
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,375
Human sexuality.

232
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,542
That's where we met,
in class.

233
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,542
Human sexuality class?

234
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,625
I see.

235
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:52,417
Hey, Eli.
The movie's about to start.

236
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,041
Uh, it was great to meet you,

237
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,709
and, uh, you are even
more beautiful than ange said.

238
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,250
Oh.

239
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:59,625
See you later.

240
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,041
Wow.

241
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,542
Not a word.

242
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,291
Not a single word.

243
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:14,250
I mean, what the hell is
she thinking?

244
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:17,709
That he's handsome,
sophisticated, a doctor.

245
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,041
He's not a doctor.
He's a teacher.

246
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,583
I was a teacher.

247
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,583
You know what I mean.

248
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:24,917
She's a grown woman.

249
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,500
No. No, she's not.

250
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,083
She's a little girl clunking
around in her daddy's shoes,

251
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,959
pretending to go off to work.

252
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,041
You need to let her
make her own mistakes,

253
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,291
take her own path.

254
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,333
I'm worried about her.
This is...

255
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,667
This is bad.

256
00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:39,125
Well, it could be worse.
How?

257
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:41,291
She could be a drug addict,

258
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,000
like her mom.

259
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,375
He's 50?
Seriously?

260
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:51,500
I could date him,

261
00:10:51,542 --> 00:10:52,667
except he's a little old
for me.

262
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:54,625
It's a disaster
in the making.

263
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:55,959
You don't know that.

264
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,709
I mean, if Angela was 40,
and the guy was near 70--

265
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,792
we'd think maybe she was
after his money.

266
00:10:59,834 --> 00:11:01,583
It's a phase.
It's never gonna work.

267
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,083
Well, of course
it's never gonna work.

268
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,333
How can you be
in a meaningful relationship

269
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,041
with someone who's more
than twice your age?

270
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:10,500
Except that the maturity is part
of what attracts her to him.

271
00:11:10,542 --> 00:11:11,792
Well, she should date
a grad student then.

272
00:11:11,834 --> 00:11:14,834
Jake must be
blowing a gasket.

273
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,542
Why is he blowing a gasket?

274
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,750
And more importantly,
why are we whispering?

275
00:11:18,792 --> 00:11:22,500
Jake's daughter is dating
a man way too old for her.

276
00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:24,041
Oh.

277
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,041
You do know
that Jake isn't here, right?

278
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,166
Sam, Angela's 20.
She's a woman.

279
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,792
- 20's not a woman.
- Maya's 19, and she's a mother.

280
00:11:32,834 --> 00:11:35,000
Giving birth
does not imply maturity.

281
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,041
Fathering a child
certainly doesn't.

282
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,041
Oh, you can't generalize.
You know, 70 degrees in may

283
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,583
doesn't seem quite as warm
as 70 in December.

284
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:44,041
See, I like what you did there
with the may and December.

285
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,959
I'm saying that every 20
is different,

286
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,417
and your transition from boy
to man, form girl to woman,

287
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,875
depends on
individual circumstance

288
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,041
and life experience.

289
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:52,583
He's her professor.

290
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:53,625
Oh.

291
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:55,792
Well, then forget it.
There's definitely a...

292
00:11:55,834 --> 00:11:57,542
Questionable power dynamic
there.

293
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:01,583
Mm. Sometimes the student has
the power.

294
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:02,834
Mm.

295
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,709
Did you sleep
with a professor?

296
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,875
Not so much a as...

297
00:12:07,917 --> 00:12:09,417
Three.

298
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,834
Three? When did you study?

299
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,458
Oh.
Was one of them a woman?

300
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,083
Look, I was fairly troubled
in college.

301
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:17,208
It was a dark time for me.

302
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,000
So exploring
my sexual boundaries

303
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,458
was a way of taking back
my sexuality.

304
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,500
And one of them was a woman?

305
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:23,792
Look, no parent
wants to think

306
00:12:23,834 --> 00:12:25,041
of one of their contemporaries

307
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,417
as helping their child explore
sexual boundaries.

308
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,083
There's something wrong
with this professor guy.

309
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,500
He needs to find a playmate
his own age.

310
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:33,125
Yeah, well, Angela seems
pretty taken with him,

311
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:35,041
and Jake's gonna
have lunch with her today

312
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,125
and--and talk about it.

313
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:38,667
He--he thinks it'll be okay.

314
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,667
Yeah, he's dreaming.

315
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:42,834
Mm-hmm.

316
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,083
I understand
you have a child?

317
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,625
I do. Angela.

318
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:48,667
Her mother passed away
quite a while ago.

319
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:50,250
Angela's in college,

320
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:53,333
and we're very close.
We, uh, we talk all the time,

321
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,250
you know, about--
about everything.

322
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,041
I'm sure
you think so.

323
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,208
Excuse me?

324
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,500
I have five children.

325
00:12:59,542 --> 00:13:01,041
They share the trivial stuff

326
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,625
just to throw you off the scent
of the really bad stuff.

327
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:05,250
Yeah, well,
I-I gather as much,

328
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,500
but even with all the hell
they put you through,

329
00:13:07,542 --> 00:13:09,041
uh, you know, I adore kids.

330
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,583
I love Henry as though
he were my own,

331
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,083
and, you know, I do have
experience in this, uh,

332
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,959
I mean, even though ange
hasn't lived with me

333
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,291
for quite some time,

334
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:19,041
parenthood is a lot like, uh,
riding a bike, right?

335
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,500
No. When you make a mistake
riding a bike,

336
00:13:21,542 --> 00:13:23,750
you fall,
you break your own neck.

337
00:13:23,792 --> 00:13:25,542
When parenting a child, failure
can be harder to notice

338
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,041
and impossible to fix.

339
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,000
Okay. But the odds are better
for Henry

340
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,333
because he has Addison and me
sharing the responsibilities.

341
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,000
And you both work.

342
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:35,709
Right. Um, but one of us is
always there for Henry.

343
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,750
I mean,
he's never left alone.

344
00:13:37,792 --> 00:13:41,583
There's a home inspection
component to this.

345
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,208
I'd like to come by
in a day or two.

346
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,375
Please have the child present.
Absolutely.

347
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:50,834
What, uh,

348
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,166
what is that?

349
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,166
I need to send your fingerprints
electronically

350
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,291
to the department of justice.
Part of the background check.

351
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:57,542
Place your finger
on the scanner.

352
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:00,000
Please try not to move.

353
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,041
Dr. Reilly,
is there a problem?

354
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,709
No.

355
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,667
No, of course not.

356
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:20,041
Hey. How'd it go?

357
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,417
Mildred's a little scary.

358
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:23,041
Well, I told you
what she was like.

359
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,375
Yeah, I wish
you would've told me

360
00:14:24,417 --> 00:14:25,792
about the, uh,
fingerprinting, too.

361
00:14:25,834 --> 00:14:27,750
Oh, I thought I did.

362
00:14:27,792 --> 00:14:30,875
Why? You got a record
that I should know about?

363
00:14:30,917 --> 00:14:33,250
Jake.
It's gonna sound
a lot worse than it is.

364
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:36,625
Okay. Start talking right now,
'cause I'm freaking out.

365
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:40,041
It was a long time ago.
Lily's--

366
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,583
Lily started using again,

367
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:44,000
and her dirtbag dealer
came over to the house,

368
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:47,041
our house, so I went outside
to tell him to go away.

369
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,083
He refused, and things got
a little out of hand,

370
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,458
so there was a fight.

371
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,667
I was protecting
my--my wife and child.

372
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:54,625
Okay. So you hit him.
That doesn't sound so bad.

373
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:57,375
Well, that wouldn't be so bad,
but I beat the crap out of him,

374
00:14:57,417 --> 00:15:00,041
the cops came,
and I was arrested.

375
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,417
Did you go to jail?

376
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,041
Just for a night.
But I got out on bail.

377
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,834
I was sentenced to probation,
did some community service.

378
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,375
The thing is,
when you're arrested,

379
00:15:08,417 --> 00:15:10,417
they take your prints
and they stay in the system,

380
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:13,667
so if Mildred
runs my prints...

381
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:15,041
Henry's my son.

382
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:18,250
This adoption is
everything to me.

383
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:19,917
Addison, this dealer
was an animal

384
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:21,959
with a rap sheet longer than
"war and peace."

385
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,542
Okay? The judge--
he understood my side.

386
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:27,959
So if Mildred reads my file,
she's gonna understand, too.

387
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,875
It's gonna be okay.
I promise.

388
00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:38,333
So...

389
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:39,917
How's school?

390
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:41,458
That's not
what you wanna ask.

391
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,041
I was easing into it.

392
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:46,041
Don't.

393
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,542
All right, look, I'm sure Eli is
a very nice man.

394
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:51,417
Actually, you know what?
I'm not sure.

395
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,041
I think this is
a very bad idea.

396
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,250
I don't need your permission.

397
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,333
You used to trust me.
I believe I've earned the right,

398
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:00,834
as your father, who loves you,
to at least state my opinion.

399
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:03,709
It would be different
if he weren't your professor.

400
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,333
For one semester.

401
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,000
Then he won't be
my professor anymore.

402
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,333
But we both know
that's not what this is about.

403
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,458
You don't like
how old he is.

404
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,583
No, I don't. He's my age.

405
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:15,709
Someday I'll be your age.

406
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,792
And then,
if you still want to,

407
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:18,709
you can date him
in the nursing home.

408
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,709
So if he was ten years younger
than you, that would be okay?

409
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,542
I mean, what's the cutoff?

410
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,041
39? 28?

411
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,375
Listen, sweetheart, you're--
you're on--

412
00:16:26,417 --> 00:16:27,750
you're on different planes.

413
00:16:27,792 --> 00:16:29,750
All right? He's got 30 years
more experience.

414
00:16:29,792 --> 00:16:33,291
You're into your what,
second real relationship? Hmm?

415
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:34,333
He'll hurt you.

416
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,750
Ethan hurt me.
He was my age.

417
00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:39,583
What looks right on paper
isn't always right.

418
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,959
You married a drug
addict and you were happy.

419
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,959
I'm trying to protect you.

420
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,041
I don't need protection.

421
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,125
I'm an adult.

422
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:46,542
Not if you have to say it.

423
00:16:48,542 --> 00:16:50,375
I love you, dad,

424
00:16:50,417 --> 00:16:53,792
but I also love Eli.

425
00:16:53,834 --> 00:16:57,000
So don't make me choose, because
you're not gonna like my choice.

426
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,125
You think that social worker
will find out?

427
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,709
I don't know.

428
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:18,041
I thought you were
gonna kill that guy.

429
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,542
I would've done anything
to protect you and ange.

430
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,208
I still would,
if it matters.

431
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,959
It does matter.

432
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,166
You need to suck it up.

433
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,250
Don't--don't tell me
to ease up on Eli.

434
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:34,291
I'm telling you to be there for
our daughter because I can't.

435
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:35,625
So hey, whatever that means.

436
00:17:35,667 --> 00:17:37,375
Lily--
no. No.

437
00:17:37,417 --> 00:17:40,625
You push too hard the other way,
she will marry him.

438
00:17:40,667 --> 00:17:42,667
You know that, right?

439
00:17:50,834 --> 00:17:54,583
Dr. Shepherd, we have to stop
meeting like this.

440
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,208
Don't get too excited,
Dr. Peterson.

441
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,208
I'm just signing off
on a consult.

442
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,333
Do you think
you could call me James

443
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:01,709
and I could call you Amelia?

444
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,083
Nope.

445
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:06,583
Okay, well, that'll make
my next question tougher.

446
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,208
You know, Billy's
on north canyon?

447
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,250
I'm there every Friday night.
Really, really good fries.

448
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,917
Anyway, you should come.

449
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:16,750
How many times are you
gonna ask me out on a date?

450
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:19,291
I wasn't. I was just saying,
I eat dinner there,

451
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,041
and you could
eat dinner there,

452
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,709
and if we happen to be
doing that

453
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:26,083
at the same table,
so be it.

454
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:30,083
And we don't have to talk
at all.

455
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,625
Think about it.

456
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:35,959
You know,

457
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,709
really, really good fries
are hard to come by.

458
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,500
Mm.
No more mentions of Sarah.

459
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,959
It's been a while. She went
missing from the E.R.,

460
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,375
what...
Six weeks ago.

461
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:50,500
And three days.

462
00:18:50,542 --> 00:18:52,250
I hope
that she's still alive.

463
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:54,041
They found Elizabeth smart
after nine months.

464
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,375
Well,
that's the exception.

465
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:56,959
The odds of finding
a missing child

466
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,542
drop exponentially
after the first couple of days.

467
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,166
Her parents--i don't--

468
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,542
I don't know how you live
through something like that.

469
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:05,083
I guess at some point,
you gotta move on, right?

470
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:08,041
And when exactly is that,
would you say?

471
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,041
I'm asking. Seriously,
weeks? Months?

472
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,792
When is it okay
to move on with your life?

473
00:19:12,834 --> 00:19:14,041
Never.
It's not that simple.

474
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,542
Letting go takes time.

475
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,083
You're plagued with memories
and betrayal

476
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,625
and guilt.
You know,
after Angela's mother died,

477
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:23,542
I think it took me a year
to smile again.

478
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:26,291
As for letting go, I think
that just depends on the person.

479
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,750
Yeah. In this situation,
there's no body,

480
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,291
and therefore no closure.
Exactly.

481
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,834
It's all speculation.
So if Sarah's alive

482
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,583
and comes back after Ron
and Dana have given up,

483
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:35,834
they'll never forgive
themselves.

484
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,041
But if she's dead,

485
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,834
and they don't move on,

486
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:43,041
they could spend decades
just waiting.

487
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:46,000
I... I don't know
how to counsel them.

488
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:54,458
So lunch didn't go so great.

489
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,542
Well, what did you think,

490
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,458
once you told her
that you didn't approve,

491
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,041
that Angela would just end it?

492
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,041
She likes him.

493
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,333
Apparently, she loves him.

494
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:07,041
I mean, what the hell does
she see in the guy anyway?

495
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,583
I'm not sure I can answer that
without getting in trouble.

496
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,333
All right, I'm sure the guy
has his positive attributes,

497
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:12,875
and if he weren't the lech
after my daughter,

498
00:20:12,917 --> 00:20:14,959
I might even see them.
This--this can't go on.

499
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,583
Well, it can
if they want it to.

500
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,125
I mean, honey, there's really
nothing that you can do.

501
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,667
I can call the university
and have him fired.

502
00:20:19,709 --> 00:20:22,041
Well, that will all but ensure
that she marries the guy.

503
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:25,625
Look, Angela's a smart girl.
She's gonna figure it out.

504
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:27,458
But I tell you what, she's gonna
get there a lot faster

505
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,709
if the two of you make peace.

506
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,875
What? No.

507
00:20:29,917 --> 00:20:32,041
Yes. You need to suck it up

508
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,250
and invite them over
for dinner.

509
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,041
Oh, no.

510
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,625
Megan's in the E.R.

511
00:20:46,542 --> 00:20:48,041
I'm so happy you're here.

512
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,500
I started cramping and I kept
trying to stay calm

513
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:52,834
and tell myself all the stuff
you always say,

514
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:53,875
but it wasn't working.

515
00:20:53,917 --> 00:20:55,041
Something is definitely wrong.

516
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:57,625
No, Megan, you know that
mild cramping is normal

517
00:20:57,667 --> 00:20:58,959
after fertility treatments.

518
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,041
I know. But this--

519
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,291
your beta h.C.G. Is fine.

520
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,250
Your os is closed.
There's no bleeding.

521
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:05,041
There's no discharge.

522
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,041
It's too early to see anything
on the ultrasound,

523
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,041
but your--
your tests were normal.

524
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,917
You're scared.
That--that's all.

525
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,750
Oh.

526
00:21:15,792 --> 00:21:18,667
Oh, god.
Uh, I'm that person.

527
00:21:18,709 --> 00:21:21,709
I'm the crazy patient
who freaks out every 15 minutes

528
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,125
and pulls you away
from your life.

529
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:24,417
I'm so sorry.

530
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:25,750
Come on now.
No need to apologize.

531
00:21:25,792 --> 00:21:29,375
No, I do. I'm so embarrassed.
Oh.

532
00:21:29,417 --> 00:21:31,875
I'm not this fragile person.
Really, I'm not.

533
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:33,667
It's just--

534
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:37,000
Danny's away, and this is
our fifth time trying.

535
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,583
And no matter
how hard I try to relax,

536
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:42,667
I'm just... waiting.

537
00:21:42,709 --> 00:21:43,875
For what?

538
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:48,000
To lose the pregnancy.

539
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,959
Last time I made it 12 weeks,

540
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,667
which was a big improvement
over four,

541
00:21:52,709 --> 00:21:56,041
but nine months--
that's an eternity.

542
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:59,250
And after so many...

543
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:01,500
Failures...

544
00:22:01,542 --> 00:22:03,542
I just feel like
the odds are against me.

545
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:06,583
No, Megan, we--we talked
about this. Right?

546
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:07,917
With every roll of the dice,

547
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:10,792
your chances of this one
sticking actually improve.

548
00:22:12,667 --> 00:22:13,709
Really?

549
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,750
Yes.

550
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:16,542
You have to be patient

551
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:19,000
and have a little faith.

552
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:21,750
And not be hysterical.

553
00:22:21,792 --> 00:22:23,500
That would help, too.

554
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,208
Okay. Now there's
no medical reason

555
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,500
why I shouldn't
discharge you.

556
00:22:26,542 --> 00:22:30,083
I-I'm not ready to--
I-I just feel better

557
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:32,500
here in the hospital.
Is that crazy?

558
00:22:32,542 --> 00:22:34,834
No. The hospital's
a safe place to be.

559
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:37,750
Would you mind--i mean, I know
you're busy and everything,

560
00:22:37,792 --> 00:22:40,250
but could you stay just--
just for a little while?

561
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:42,000
Just until I'm sure
that everything's okay?

562
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:49,458
Hey, babe.

563
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,250
Hey.
I'm sorry I'm late.

564
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:52,625
You were late two hours ago,

565
00:22:52,667 --> 00:22:54,166
but you're in time
for leftovers.

566
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,583
I was at the hospital
with Megan.

567
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:57,583
What, did she miscarry again?

568
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:59,000
No. Nothing's wrong
with her medically.

569
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:01,041
She was scared, though,
thought she was losing her baby,

570
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:04,417
so I stayed with her.

571
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:06,709
You were paged
over six hours ago.

572
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,291
Yeah, well, fear
isn't like pain, honey.

573
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:11,291
You can't just medicate someone
and leave in five minutes.

574
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:14,041
Well, yeah, you also can't
sign up for nine months of this.

575
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:16,375
That's what I do,
especially in Megan's case,

576
00:23:16,417 --> 00:23:18,625
with her husband gone
as much as he is.

577
00:23:18,667 --> 00:23:20,417
She needs the extra support.

578
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:23,000
I think that the level
of doctoring that Megan needs

579
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:25,083
is bordering
on unreasonable.

580
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:27,250
That's not fair.
She's making up excuses
to see you.

581
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:29,041
She thought
something was wrong.
Well, something's
definitely wrong.

582
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:31,625
Part of it's in her head
and part of it's on you.

583
00:23:31,667 --> 00:23:33,041
What the hell does that mean?

584
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:36,083
Okay, you seriously cannot see
how you are complicit in this?

585
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:39,417
You are so kind and so available
that you make it easy

586
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:40,667
for patients
to take advantage of you.

587
00:23:40,709 --> 00:23:41,959
Look, if I can't be there
for my patients,

588
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,333
if I can't give them
all that I got,

589
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:44,750
then I might as well
give up medicine.

590
00:23:44,792 --> 00:23:47,041
Okay, but you cannot be there
for all of them all the time.

591
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:49,125
You've got to set boundaries
because they won't.

592
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:51,625
Stop. Stop trying to tell me
how to practice medicine,

593
00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:53,041
how to run my life,

594
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:54,667
because I was doing just fine
before you came along.

595
00:23:54,709 --> 00:23:57,041
But I am here now,
and the choices that you make--

596
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:58,959
they affect our life.

597
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:00,834
I mean, how is it
that you can commit

598
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:03,041
to these women you barely know
and you can't commit to me?

599
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:04,458
I'm a fertility specialist.

600
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,542
The women that come to me--
when they get pregnant,

601
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:08,625
it's my job to see them
through the nine months,

602
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:11,041
and I won't stop doing that,
no matter how jealous

603
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:12,500
or insecure or crazy you get.

604
00:24:12,542 --> 00:24:14,041
W--
this is not about me.

605
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:16,041
Really?
Because everything else is.

606
00:24:27,709 --> 00:24:29,792
Nice job pissing off
the entire world.

607
00:24:29,834 --> 00:24:31,917
No, just the women.

608
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:33,792
Really? You gonna grab Eli

609
00:24:33,834 --> 00:24:35,041
and take him
to a cigar bar then?

610
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:37,041
Look, I got it from ange,
I got it from Addison.

611
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:38,500
I don't need it from you.

612
00:24:38,542 --> 00:24:39,750
Well, Addison's right.

613
00:24:39,792 --> 00:24:42,041
Balance, boundaries--
those things matter.

614
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:43,875
You always gave too much
at the office.

615
00:24:43,917 --> 00:24:45,750
Look, you cannot blame
the drugs on me.
I know.

616
00:24:45,792 --> 00:24:48,000
Okay, 'cause I was there
all the time,

617
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:51,542
until I couldn't watch you
destroy yourself anymore.

618
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:53,959
I know.

619
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,500
But what I'm saying is,

620
00:24:55,542 --> 00:24:58,333
you don't have to avoid
going home anymore.

621
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:00,834
There's no more drugs
in your life,

622
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:02,709
no more terror,

623
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,417
no more me.

624
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:08,041
It's just the woman
who loves you, her kid,

625
00:25:08,083 --> 00:25:10,625
and our kid.

626
00:25:10,667 --> 00:25:13,792
There's nothing in your way
except you.

627
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:24,041
You look like crap.

628
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:26,750
Thanks.

629
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:28,000
I just meant--

630
00:25:28,041 --> 00:25:30,125
no, I feel like crap,
so it's fitting.

631
00:25:30,166 --> 00:25:33,834
You know, one of the many things
that I've learned this past year

632
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:36,417
is to be a very good listener.

633
00:25:36,458 --> 00:25:38,041
I appreciate it,
but the elevator ride is

634
00:25:38,083 --> 00:25:40,375
way too short
for what I've got going on.

635
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,750
Jake.

636
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,458
Dr. Shepherd.

637
00:25:59,834 --> 00:26:01,333
See you.

638
00:26:07,709 --> 00:26:10,834
You know, one of the many things
I've learned over the past year

639
00:26:10,875 --> 00:26:13,166
since I joined the practice
is that apparently,

640
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:15,041
everyone else's business
is mine,

641
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:17,041
so I'm just gonna say it--

642
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:19,875
James is a good guy.

643
00:26:19,917 --> 00:26:21,208
Okay.

644
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:24,583
Amelia, my daughter is dating
her college professor,

645
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:26,041
and while I wish
she wasn't dating at all,

646
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:28,750
if she has to be, then, well,

647
00:26:28,792 --> 00:26:30,834
I think someone like James is
a pretty good catch.

648
00:26:30,875 --> 00:26:32,291
Well, why don't
you date him then?

649
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:33,834
I'm spoken for.
I don't think of him
like that.

650
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:36,500
Yes, you do.
It's pretty obvious.

651
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:39,542
It's just--everything's good
now, you know, and I don't--

652
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:41,041
you did all that work,

653
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:43,041
you've come so far,
don't...

654
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:45,959
Don't walk away
from an opportunity.

655
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:49,041
You deserve to be happy.

656
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:50,500
Be happy, Amelia.

657
00:27:02,208 --> 00:27:03,875
This was a brilliant idea.

658
00:27:03,917 --> 00:27:06,667
I'm so glad
I listened to you.

659
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:08,041
Angela's your daughter

660
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:09,709
and is the most important thing
in the world.

661
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,542
You and I can resume fighting
after dinner,

662
00:27:11,583 --> 00:27:14,667
but in the meantime,
let's just make the best of it.

663
00:27:14,709 --> 00:27:16,000
Shall we?

664
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:30,500
Thanks again for having us over.

665
00:27:30,542 --> 00:27:32,667
Yes, thank you.
No, we're just happy

666
00:27:32,709 --> 00:27:35,917
that you could make it on
such short notice, right, honey?

667
00:27:35,959 --> 00:27:38,000
Yes, very happy.

668
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:43,834
Um, so, Eli,

669
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:47,917
Angela tells me that you're
a big basketball fan, huh?

670
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:49,625
And so is Jake.

671
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:51,000
Oh, is that right?

672
00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:52,709
Well, we should catch
a Lakers game sometime.

673
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,709
I think they have a real shot
at winning it all this year.

674
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,041
You know,
I like Oklahoma city.

675
00:27:56,083 --> 00:27:59,709
They're young, fresh,
no baggage.

676
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:03,583
Hmm. But the, uh, Lakers have
the veterans and the experience.

677
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:06,291
That's important
for a balanced team.

678
00:28:06,333 --> 00:28:07,792
Balance is overrated.

679
00:28:07,834 --> 00:28:08,625
I think the rookies

680
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:10,750
are doing fine on their own.
Dad.

681
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:15,000
You know, excuse me.

682
00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:23,250
No. Uh...

683
00:28:23,291 --> 00:28:25,500
Let them go.

684
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:33,583
Look, uh,

685
00:28:33,625 --> 00:28:35,750
I know what
you're thinking.

686
00:28:35,792 --> 00:28:39,375
Oh,
I doubt that very much.

687
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:43,875
Angela's very special to me.

688
00:28:43,917 --> 00:28:45,917
Sure.

689
00:28:45,959 --> 00:28:47,375
Lovely young woman
who adores you,

690
00:28:47,417 --> 00:28:50,583
who thinks every word out of
your mouth is witty and clever

691
00:28:50,625 --> 00:28:51,917
because she probably
doesn't know

692
00:28:51,959 --> 00:28:53,667
you've been using
those same, old tired lines

693
00:28:53,709 --> 00:28:56,291
on women your age for decades.

694
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:58,583
Yeah, that's gotta be nice.

695
00:28:58,625 --> 00:29:00,041
I wasn't looking
for an ego boost.

696
00:29:00,083 --> 00:29:01,917
Then what are

she was in diapers.

Look, I understand
your reservations.

700

She's your daughter.
You're protecting her.

701
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:14,041
But I'm not a bad guy.

702
00:29:14,083 --> 00:29:19,041
Okay, I was married
to a woman my age for 20 years.

703
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:20,625
It didn't work out.

704
00:29:20,667 --> 00:29:23,208
So now you've decided to use
the female student population

705
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:24,750
as your own
personal dating pool?

706
00:29:24,792 --> 00:29:27,709
I have never
dated a student before.

707
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:31,875

and curious--

710
00:29:35,959 --> 00:29:38,792
I know her attributes.
I raised her.

711
00:29:39,959 --> 00:29:41,041

712
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:43,875
Yeah, well, that's too bad.

713

00:29:55,792 --> 00:29:57,291
Or what?

718
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:59,667
You don't want to find out.

719
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:11,875
What? I didn't lose my temper.

720
00:30:11,917 --> 00:30:14,166
Semantics. That was
a very thinly veiled threat.

721
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:15,166
Oh, I meant it.

722
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:17,959
I know.
Pretty sure he does, too.

723
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,041
Would you want me to give ange
away at their wedding?

724
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:22,166
Well, I think there's another
wedding to consider before hers.

725
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:25,750
I told you, I don't want
to discuss that with you.

Look, babe, I...
I get it.

727
00:30:29,625 --> 00:30:32,208
It's hard to let go.

728
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:34,291
It's still easier than
the alternative.

00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,041
All right,
I'm being your father.

876
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:39,959
I love you, but I don't
like Eli, not for you.

877
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,834
Tell me Eli misunderstood.

878
00:37:41,875 --> 00:37:43,542
Tell me you didn't say
those things to my boyfriend.

879
00:37:43,583 --> 00:37:45,333
Look, it's my job
to keep you safe.

880
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:47,959
By threatening his life?

881
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,709
Is this a bad time?

882
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:01,750
I am so sorry. I-I'll do
anything to make it right.

883
00:38:01,792 --> 00:38:04,041
I-I'll call Mildred.

884
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:07,750
Please, just...

885
00:38:07,792 --> 00:38:10,291
Say something.

886
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:12,000
It's going to be fine.

887
00:38:15,083 --> 00:38:17,041
I know you're mad,
and you should be,

888
00:38:17,083 --> 00:38:18,959
and you were right about Megan,
about Angela,

889
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,250
about everything.

890
00:38:21,291 --> 00:38:23,667
I'm sorry, truly.

891
00:38:23,709 --> 00:38:25,875
I fully accept
all of your apologies,

892
00:38:25,917 --> 00:38:28,041
but I truly believe that
everything is going to be fine,

893
00:38:28,083 --> 00:38:31,041
because Henry is my son,
and you are the love of my life,

894
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:33,542
and we're supposed to be
a family,

895
00:38:33,583 --> 00:38:35,500
and Mildred will see that.

896
00:38:35,542 --> 00:38:38,667
