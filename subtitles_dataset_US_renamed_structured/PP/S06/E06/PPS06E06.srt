00:00:03,291 --> 00:00:05,083
♪ Ohhh ohhh ohhh ♪

2
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:15,000
Hello.

3
00:00:16,667 --> 00:00:18,125
Oh.

4
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,750
What I'm saying is,

5
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:26,041
open adoptions are negotiable.

6
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:27,750
It's just a matter of deciding

7
00:00:27,792 --> 00:00:29,792
what makes
each of you comfortable.

8
00:00:29,834 --> 00:00:32,041
Well, whatever judi needs...
I'm gonna be really busy
with school, so...

9
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:33,041
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:34,333
I'm sorry. Go ahead.

11
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:36,208
No, I was
just going to say,

12
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,041
I am so grateful to you,
judi,

13
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:40,166
so whatever you need
to feel comfortable...

14
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:42,542
I feel comfortable.
I-I mean, it's...

15
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:44,333
Um...

16
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:46,542
I don't know. I'm sorry.

17
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:49,667
Mildred, is there
some sort of model for this?

18
00:00:49,709 --> 00:00:51,542
I mean, what do people
usually do?

19
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:55,041
I-I want judi to be
a part of Henry's life

20
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:56,834
if she wants to be.

21
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:58,917
Um, I'd like him to know
where he comes from.

22
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:02,000
But, uh, maybe some guidelines
would be helpful.

23
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:03,208
Sure.

24
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,333
A common setup is
weekly photos, monthly visits.

25
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:09,875
Judi?

26
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:12,917
Sure.

27
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:14,709
Yeah, okay.

28
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:19,625
This is an open adoption.

29
00:01:19,667 --> 00:01:21,083
I have to be open,
and I don't feel open.

30
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:23,709
I feel like I wanna...

31
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,500
Take Henry and run.

32
00:01:25,542 --> 00:01:27,041
I mean,
what if she hates me?

33
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:28,667
What if she thinks
I'm doing a terrible job?

34
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:30,750
That's not gonna happen.
Yeah? Well, then
why did she come now?

35
00:01:30,792 --> 00:01:32,041
I mean, no visits
in eight months.

36
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:33,709
No replies
to any of my e-mails.

37
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:34,667
Why now?

38
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:36,041
Well, maybe it's taken her
this long

39
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:37,208
to wrap her head
around all this.

40
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,750
I mean, she did have a baby
and give him away.

41
00:01:39,792 --> 00:01:42,333
Oh, so you're saying
not everything's about me?

42
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:44,083
A little bit,
that's what I'm saying.

43
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:45,625
But only if it makes you
feel better.

44
00:01:45,667 --> 00:01:48,208
It does.

45
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,083
Thank you.

46
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:52,333
Okay, Henry.

47
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:55,458
Let's go meet
the lady who made you.

48
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,750
Hmm?

49
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:04,041
Judi.

50
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:07,083
Hi. Um, I-I brought a...

51
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:10,375
Wow.

52
00:02:10,417 --> 00:02:13,041
He is advanced in all milestones
except peekaboo,

53
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:14,458
but we'll get there.

54
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,500
And he loves, uh, tigger
and mashed carrots.

55
00:02:16,542 --> 00:02:19,041
I mean, well,
all things orange.

56
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:21,542
He's so big.

57
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:22,500
Yeah, not too big,
though.

58
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:24,041
I mean, he's a fat baby,

59
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:25,709
but in a healthy
fat baby way,

60
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,875
not in a bad fat baby way.

61
00:02:26,917 --> 00:02:30,250
You know, he's good.
I'm doing a good job.

62
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:32,291
I'm...

63
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:33,750
Talking too much.

64
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:36,125
Um...

65
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:38,625
Would you mind
if I held him?

66
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,125
Of course.

67
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:42,792
Um...

68
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,417
Hi. Hi.

69
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:50,625
Hi, Henry.

70
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:52,166
Hey, remember me?

71
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,041
I'm...

72
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:55,625
I'm judi.

73
00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:58,542
Yeah. Hi.

74
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:06,000
Yeah.

75
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,792
Okay, Henry.
Look over here.

76
00:03:07,834 --> 00:03:09,792
Look at tigger.
Wave to tigger, honey.

77
00:03:09,834 --> 00:03:11,041
That's a good boy.

78
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,792
Oh, honey, I gotta get
a new memory card.

79
00:03:12,834 --> 00:03:14,834
It'll just take a minute.
Okay.

80
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:18,542
Oh. Did you, um,
want to give him the bunny?

81
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:19,709
What?

82
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,750
I noticed you brought
the stuffed animal.

83
00:03:20,792 --> 00:03:22,000
Did you want to give it
to him?

84
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:25,458
Oh, yeah. Um... no.

85
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,250
It kinda seems like
he's got everything he needs.

86
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,625
Thank you for saying that.
I was, um...

87
00:03:31,667 --> 00:03:35,375
I was really nervous
before you got here.

88
00:03:35,417 --> 00:03:39,458
Why? Um, you're the most
together person I've ever met.

89
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,041
I... I just think
you wanting to see him,

90
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:44,792
it just, um...
It surprised me, you know?

91
00:03:44,834 --> 00:03:48,041
I mean, you haven't shown
much interest until now.

92
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,792
I mean, I sent you photos,
you didn't reply.

93
00:03:49,834 --> 00:03:51,667
And you haven't scheduled
any visits until now.

94
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:53,583
I'm just...
I don't know.

95
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:57,166
I'm just wondering what...
What changed.

96
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:59,583
I don't open
most of your e-mails.

97
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:02,083
It's not that
I'm not interested, but, um,

98
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,291
I don't know. It--
it's been hard.

99
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:07,041
Oh. Oh.

100
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,667
You know that thing

101
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:10,041
where you're afraid
you forgot something?

102
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,417
I-I mean,
you do other stuff,

103
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:15,667
but all you can think about
is that you forgot something.

104
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:16,875
Yeah. I hate that feeling.

105
00:04:16,917 --> 00:04:18,709
Since I gave Henry
to you,

106
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,750
I-I feel like that...

107
00:04:20,792 --> 00:04:21,959
All the time.

108
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,667
I mean, e-except now.

109
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:26,041
Just seeing him

110
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,500
and how well he's doing...

111
00:04:27,542 --> 00:04:30,667
I don't know.
The feeling's gone right now.

112
00:04:32,667 --> 00:04:34,709
Well, I can
send you photos every day,

113
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,125
and you really can schedule
monthly visits.

114
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,667
I'm still open to that.

115
00:04:38,709 --> 00:04:41,041
Yeah.
That would be cool.

116
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,834
But, um, I was hoping,

117
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,667
if it's not too much
or whatever,

118
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:47,709
maybe I could see Henry
again sooner?

119
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,417
Like tomorrow?

120
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,000
Sure.

121
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,667
Wait.

122
00:04:56,709 --> 00:04:58,041
So she hasn't visited
in eight months,

123
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,041
and now she wants to visit
two days in a row?

124
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,792
It's too much,
and she knows it.

125
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:03,083
Is judi regretting

126
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,667
her decision to put Henry
up for adoption?

127
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:06,500
I didn't get that impression.

128
00:05:06,542 --> 00:05:07,750
Well, maybe seeing
that her child's well cared for

129
00:05:07,792 --> 00:05:09,250
will actually help her
move on.

130
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:10,500
The point of open adoption

131
00:05:10,542 --> 00:05:11,542
is not for the birth mother
to move on.

132
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:12,792
The point is
to have the birth mother

133
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:14,083
involved in the child's life,

134
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:16,291
which... can be
a powerful thing.

135
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,500
It's a douchey thing.

136
00:05:17,542 --> 00:05:18,750
Cooper.

137
00:05:18,792 --> 00:05:19,959
You don't give a kid up

138
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,542
and then hang around
confusing everybody.

139
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:23,166
I mean, I can't imagine
what that would've been like.

140
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,333
Just because
you can't imagine it

141
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,041
doesn't mean
that it's an invalid choice.

142
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:30,542
Is anybody else here
adopted that they know of?

143
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:33,041
No? Okay. Then I get more say
than any of you people.

144
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,542
And I say it's douchey.

145
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:35,750
Addison, move to Burbank.

146
00:05:35,792 --> 00:05:37,041
Sell the house, disappear.

147
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:38,500
Henry doesn't need
this kind of confusion.

148
00:05:38,542 --> 00:05:40,709
Judi's presence
could be beneficial to Henry.

149
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,041
If he knows her,
he won't have fantasies

150
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:46,041
that his birth mother is a spy
or a queen or a supermodel.

151
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,000
Those sound like
your fantasies.

152
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:51,041
The point is, if we remove
the element of mystery,

153
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,041
Henry won't have any illusions
that judi would've made him

154
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:55,083
a better life
than the one he has now.

155
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:56,750
What if the birth mother
is a bad influence?

156
00:05:56,792 --> 00:05:58,000
Well,
that's relatively rare.

157
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,333
These women tend to be
selfless,

158
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:00,834
envisioning a future
for their baby

159
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,667
that they are
unable to provide.

160
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:05,250
They also tend to have goals
that are incompatible

161
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:08,041
with premature parenthood.

162
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,333
Premature parenthood?
Is that a thing?

163
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,250
It is now.
Oh.

164
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,000
The arrangement can be
good for everyone involved,

165
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,041
provided adequate boundaries
are set.

166
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,417
Oh,
that can be tough, though.

167
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:18,625
If judi's around all the time,

168
00:06:18,667 --> 00:06:20,166
she might start weighing in
on parenting decisions.

169
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,417
It's not about weighing
in on parenting decisions.

170
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:24,041
It's about making sure

171
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,000
that everyone
in the adoption triad is...

172
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,208
Addison.

173
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,041
Sweetheart.

174
00:06:33,834 --> 00:06:36,583
I'm his mom.

175
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,542
I just want to be his mom.

176
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:45,250
Dr. Carlsmith,
I'm Dr. Peterson.

177
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:47,291
I understand you're having
some abdominal discomfort.

178
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,041
In the right upper quadrant.

179
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,583
Start an I.V.

180
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,041
It could be a few things.

181
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,667
It could be,
but it's not.

182
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:55,458
I have gastric cancer.

183
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,041
Okay.

184
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,959
Let me see what's going on.

185
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,542
Where'd you go to school?

186
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,083
U.s.c. Residency
and fellowship.

187
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,417
Med school at Stanford.
Thank goodness.

188
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,667
I was afraid you'd say
one of those quack schools.

189
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:11,208
My first day,
my first E.R. rotation,

190
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,041
a woman in labor
presented in frank breech.

191
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,750
I had just read your paper

192
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:16,125
on the external cephalic
version technique.

193
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:18,709
Mm.
The description was so clear,
I performed it flawlessly.

194
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,667
Hmm.

195
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:21,208
I saved her life
and then the baby's.

196
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,667
Sounds like you got lucky.

197
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,417
With your help.
Ohh!

198
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:26,458
Fentanyl, 50 I.V.

199
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,083
And let's get
an abdominal C.T.

200
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,333
Vivian, is there someone
we can call for you,

201
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,667
someone who can be here
with you?

202
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:34,792
No, no.
No need to call anyone.

203
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:37,750
I don't want to be
a bother.

204
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:40,500
Okay, just give me a call
when she's at 7 centimeters.

205
00:07:40,542 --> 00:07:42,041
Now we take it all
for granted,

206
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,959
but at the time,
there was no treatment.

207
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,792
She's the one who actually
came up with the idea

208
00:07:45,834 --> 00:07:47,709
to put the temporary plug
in the fetal trachea.

209
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,166
Are you talking about
Dr. Vivian carlsmith?

210
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,458
Yeah.

211
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,667
She's in the E.R.

212
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:54,542
I'm going to admit you.

213
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:58,250
Oh, I've already spent too much
of my life in hospitals.

214
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,250
Yeah, but we have
really good pudding.

215
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:01,458
Vivian.

216
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,333
Addison.
Sorry, Addison.

217
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:04,500
The chart didn't indicate
you're her doctor.

218
00:08:04,542 --> 00:08:07,792
Oh! No, I'm not.

219
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:09,792
She's my friend,
my mentor.

220
00:08:09,834 --> 00:08:12,375
Oh, that word
makes me feel old.

221
00:08:12,417 --> 00:08:14,041
Oh, no. She taught me
everything I know.

222
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,166
Why are you in the E.R.?

223
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:16,417
What are you doing in L.A.?

224
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:17,750
I'm fine.

225
00:08:17,792 --> 00:08:20,750
U.c.l.a. Hired me as a part
of their guest lecture series.

226
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,709
And I thought you were still
in Seattle

227
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,333
with Derek and Richard.

228
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:25,792
Yeah, well, I took a page
out of your book

229
00:08:25,834 --> 00:08:28,041
and decided to move
to a warmer climate.

230
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:29,709
Mm.
I just, you know,

231
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,625
didn't wait until I retired,
that's all.

232
00:08:31,667 --> 00:08:33,750
The pupil surpasses
the teacher.

233
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:35,083
Oh.

234
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,083
Can you give her something?

235
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,500
Already did.
Another 50 fentanyl I.V.

236
00:08:39,542 --> 00:08:41,375
Okay, Vivian,
what's going on?

237
00:08:41,417 --> 00:08:43,041
You tell me.

238
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,667
Acute abdominal pain,

239
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:46,041
nausea, bloating--

240
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,875
you want me to play
find the diagnosis now?

241
00:08:48,917 --> 00:08:50,041
Mm.

242
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,625
All right, fine. Uh...

243
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:52,625
Choleocystitis?

244
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:53,834
Pancreatitis?

245
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,834
Wrong,
but in fairness,

246
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,333
I left something out.

247
00:08:57,375 --> 00:09:00,125
Family history
of c-h-1 mutation.

248
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,625
Gastrocarcinoma.

249
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:09,959
You always were
my smartest student.

250
00:09:13,917 --> 00:09:15,250
This can't be right.

251
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:17,625
When's the last time
you saw her?

252
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:20,792
Too... long ago.

253
00:09:20,834 --> 00:09:22,000
What's your treatment plan?

254
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,250
I ordered an abdominal C.T.

255
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,709
And I'll admit her
for pain management.

256
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,000
Good. That's good.

257
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,500
But my fear
is that her symptoms mean

258
00:09:27,542 --> 00:09:29,041
the cancer has metastasized
to the liver.

259
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,667
It's an easy diagnosis to miss,

260
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:32,875
and it's almost never caught
in time.

261
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:34,667
She said she didn't want
to be a bother,

262
00:09:34,709 --> 00:09:36,166
but she really should have
family here.

263
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,667
All she had was a sister,
and she died years ago.

264
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:39,583
There's no one left.

265
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,333
Dr. Peterson!

266
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:44,041
What happened?

267
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,709
She was upstairs in p.T.

268
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,959
She tried to walk
and she fell, hit her head.

269
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,250
Mommy, it hurts.

270
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,750
I know, baby. I know.
It's gonna be okay.

271
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:53,041
What's your name, sweetie?

272
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,667
Gwen.
I'm Dr. James,

273
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:57,041
and we're gonna fix that
right up, okay? I promise.

274
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,041
You did this.

275
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,709
This is your fault.

276
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,458
I-I'm sorry?

277
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,625
You don't even recognize me,
do you?

278
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:06,917
Sean patruchi.

279
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,500
Eight years ago...
Right.

280
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:10,041
In utero surgery--

281
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,542
spina bifida. I'm sorry.
It just took me a minute.

282
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,542
You said my baby
would be okay,

283
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,500
promised me
she'd have a good life.

284
00:10:15,542 --> 00:10:16,667
You lied.

285
00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:18,458
Listen to me.
I can see you're upset--

286
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,041
don't patronize me.

287
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,750
I have been through hell
since Gwen was born.

288
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:24,750
You were my doctor.
You should've...

289
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:27,542
You should've told me
to have an abortion.

290
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,917
I should've had
an abortion.

291
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,333
Well, what about
family names?

292
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:50,291
If there's a girl,
I like Marjorie.

293
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,250
Yeah, but--

294
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:53,250
but Marjorie's
not a family name.

295
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,041
That's the name
of your horse.

296
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,041
Whom I loved more than
either of my brothers.

297
00:10:58,166 --> 00:10:59,333
Any good grandparent names?

298
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,041
Walter, Miriam, Irving,
and Rivka?

299
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,291
It's too waspy, though,
right?

300
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:03,417
Mm.

301
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:04,333
I feel bad for Addison.

302
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,959
It cannot be easy

303
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,959
with Henry's birth mom
coming around all the time.

304
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,333
It's hard enough for us
to make parenting decisions,

305
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:12,208
and we chose each other.

306
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,500
Right?

307
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:15,041
I mean, if you make
the honorable decision

308
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,041
to give up your child
so they can have a better life,

309
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:20,041
then you need to back off
and let them have that life.

310
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,041
That's a little harsh.

311
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,041
Everybody's needs
are different.

312
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,583
Okay, you're right,

313
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,583
but, like, I've imagined what it
would be like if, you know,

314
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:30,041
one day my birth mother
just knocked on the door...

315
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,625
You are curious about her.

316
00:11:32,667 --> 00:11:34,166
Well, yeah,
of course I am,

317
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:37,166
but nobody gives up a child
unless they're in crisis.

318
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:40,417
So who am I to go
and... try and find her?

319
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,041
I mean, what if that made
her life worse?

320
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,041
I've had an amazing life,
and she's responsible,

321
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:48,208
so I want my birth mother
to have a good life, too.

322
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,375
You were adopted?

323
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:52,250
Yeah.

324
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:55,041
Yeah, I w--i was.

325
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:57,375
The woman
who gave birth to me

326
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:58,417
couldn't take care of me--

327
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:02,291
well, I-I know
what adopted is.

328
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,250
What's her name?

329
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,875
I don't know. I don't know
anything about her.

330
00:12:06,917 --> 00:12:08,250
Nothing?

331
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:09,417
Nope.

332
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,875
I don't want to be late
for school. Are you ready?

333
00:12:13,917 --> 00:12:16,208
Yeah.

334
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,083
Let's go.

335
00:12:23,917 --> 00:12:25,709
He's beautiful.

336
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,250
He's perfect, right?

337
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,041
I know you went
back and forth about it,

338
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:33,417
but I always suspected
you'd decide to have children.

339
00:12:34,917 --> 00:12:37,834
You didn't go for that
natural birth malarkey, did you?

340
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,083
Actually,
I didn't deliver.

341
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,041
I mean, technically, I did,
I guess.

342
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,458
I was the o.B. On the case.

343
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,041
But the birth mother--judi--

344
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,333
is the one who actually
pushed him out.

345
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,834
I... I adopted Henry.

346
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,083
You did?

347
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:53,041
Yes, I did. Actually, judi
came to visit us yesterday.

348
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:56,291
Wait. The birth mother
visited you?

349
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,250
Why?

350
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:58,750
I don't know.

351
00:12:58,792 --> 00:12:59,959
I mean, I hadn't heard
from her in months.

352
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,041
I thought I would,
but I didn't.

353
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,333
And then yesterday,
she wanted to visit.

354
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,333
It w--i--it was...
It was actually okay.

355
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:06,875
I don't understand.

356
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:08,375
She wanted to see Henry,
and you let her?

357
00:13:08,417 --> 00:13:10,417
Yeah, it's part of
our adoption agreement.

358
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:15,166
To hold a child
you gave up...

359
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:16,917
Are you okay?

360
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,917
To know
your baby is safe...

361
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,000
Vivian, are you all right?

362
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,166
I can't. I...

363
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,959
I've never told anyone.

364
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,375
Well, you can tell me.

365
00:13:28,417 --> 00:13:30,000
What is it?

366
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:35,458
In 1954, I had a baby.

367
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,250
I was 15.

368
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:41,041
I never got to hold her.

369
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:43,792
The nuns gave her
to a catholic family.

370
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,375
I had a baby,

371
00:13:47,417 --> 00:13:50,333
and they took her away
from me.

372
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:58,000
Sam, when is your TV show
gonna be on the air?

373
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,041
Oh, it's just a pilot, so...

374
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,417
They have to decide on...
Things.

375
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:05,375
Damn. I was excited to start
calling you the situation.

376
00:14:06,542 --> 00:14:07,917
Excuse me.

377
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:09,792
I'm looking for
a Dr. Addison Forbes Montgomery.

378
00:14:09,834 --> 00:14:11,333
Oh, that's me.

379
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:14,166
You've been served.

380
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:21,458
What is it?

381
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,834
I'm being sued
by my former patient--

382
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,375
Sean patruchi--

383
00:14:25,417 --> 00:14:28,041
for wrongful birth
of her daughter.

384
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,375
What does that mean?

385
00:14:29,417 --> 00:14:31,041
It means the patient believes
her baby shouldn't exist.

386
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,041
Yeah, but she's not a baby.
Gwen is 7 years old.

387
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:34,417
What's wrong with her?

388
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,208
When Sean was pregnant,
I diagnosed Gwen, her baby,

389
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,417
with spina bifida.

390
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:39,959
I gave her options
and I recommended fetal surgery.

391
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,375
Well, it was a cutting-edge
procedure at the time.

392
00:14:41,417 --> 00:14:43,166
It's not a surprise
if that wasn't a success.

393
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,959
No, it worked.

394
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,417
She just hit her head in p.T.
She's starting to walk.

395
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:48,709
That's a miracle.

396
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,041
Apparently
not miracle enough.

397
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,792
No, I ran into Sean
yesterday in the E.R.

398
00:14:51,834 --> 00:14:53,041
She flipped out on me

399
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,250
and she said she wanted
a normal life for her daughter

400
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:56,709
and because she didn't get it,

401
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,458
she thinks I should've
advised her to abort.

402
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,000
Well, some parents
are not equipped

403
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,625
to care for
a less-than-perfect child.

404
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,041
I've read lots of blogs

405
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,041
by moms whose babies
are less than perfect.

406
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,208
The majority believe that
parenting a special needs child

407
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,875
is--is a blessing.

408
00:15:08,917 --> 00:15:11,166
All of us are less than perfect.
People just want guarantees.

409
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,375
That's why they have
the genetic screening

410
00:15:12,417 --> 00:15:13,875
and the prenatal testing.

411
00:15:13,917 --> 00:15:15,500
Those tests are done
before birth,

412
00:15:15,542 --> 00:15:17,041
and sometimes
even before conception.

413
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,792
This child is 7 years old?

414
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,041
You know,
none of this is new.

415
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,208
I mean, the ancient romans

416
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,041
left their disabled kids out
for the wolves to eat.

417
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,667
Oh.

418
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:26,291
What?
I said the blessing thing.

419
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,041
Who cares
if a kid can't walk?

420
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:29,417
Neither can Stephen Hawking
or Itzhak perlman.

421
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,417
Never stopped them
from being an overachiever.

422
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,333
How does a mother say
her own child's life

423
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,041
is not worth living?

424
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,417
I mean, how do you say that
about any life?

425
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,333
It would be one thing
if I had done something wrong

426
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:39,917
or made a mistake,
but I didn't.

427
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:41,291
I helped her.

428
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,125
You did.
You gave her a child.

429
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,000
It's not your fault she
can't handle being a mother.

430
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,041
Wee! Yeah.

431
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,041
You're having a swing,
aren't you?

432
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,542
Wee.

433
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,166
Oh, Henry.

434
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,375
Look at him smiling.

435
00:15:58,417 --> 00:16:00,041
Addison.

436
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:03,041
My god.

437
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,000
Hi.

438
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,250
Hi.

439
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,917
Um, I hope you don't mind,
but I-I brought someone.

440
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:12,291
Addison, Jake, this is Donna.

441
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:13,250
She's my, um--

442
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:14,750
I'm Henry's grandmother.

443
00:16:21,834 --> 00:16:23,083
God, judi. He looks
exactly like you.

444
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:25,083
Just exactly like you.

445
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:27,291
It's like going back
in time.

446
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,041
I hope this is okay.

447
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,625
Maybe I should've mentioned--

448
00:16:30,667 --> 00:16:31,792
You definitely
should've mentioned--

449
00:16:31,834 --> 00:16:34,083
no, no, it's okay.
I mean... I'm fine.

450
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,792
I'm just a little surprised,
that's all.

451
00:16:35,834 --> 00:16:37,333
Sweetie,
that makes two of us.

452
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,792
Believe me, I never thought
I'd be the mother

453
00:16:38,834 --> 00:16:40,542
who didn't know
her kid was pregnant.

454
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,041
We didn't talk
for almost a year

455
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,750
because she didn't like
my boyfriend.

456
00:16:43,792 --> 00:16:45,083
That wasn't why.
Mom.

457
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,333
Please.

458
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:47,583
You two, you're adults.

459
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:50,125
You think a kid should
disappear from her mom's life

460
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,375
and fail to mention
she'd had a baby

461
00:16:51,417 --> 00:16:52,625
because of a disagreement?

462
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:55,208
It was more
than a disagreement.

463
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:58,625
Would you mind?

464
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:00,500
Could I hold my grandson?

465
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,041
Hi.

466
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,667
Judi, is this why
you wanted to see Henry

467
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:13,041
after such a long time,

468
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,542
because you wanted
your mother to meet him?

469
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,750
No, no.

470
00:17:16,792 --> 00:17:18,041
Or yes.

471
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,166
I don't know.

472
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,166
Look, I wanted to see him.

473
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,625
Every day,
I wanted to see him.

474
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,041
But after mom and I made up
and I told her,

475
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,166
I guess how bad she wanted
to see him

476
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,333
gave me the courage
to call.

477
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:33,041
I wish
you could've come to me.

478
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,291
If you had just told me...

479
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:42,625
Gin.

480
00:17:42,667 --> 00:17:43,583
Are you cheating?

481
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:46,709
In my day, E.R. docs
were better losers.

482
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,041
Your deal.

483
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,500
You said best of three,

484
00:17:49,542 --> 00:17:51,208
then we could talk about
your test results.

485
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,500
Another hand.

486
00:17:53,542 --> 00:17:55,583
The cancer has spread...

487
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,709
To your liver.

488
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,917
We need to talk about--
we don't, actually.

489
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:02,667
You're going to tell me
the cancer is stage iv,

490
00:18:02,709 --> 00:18:05,041
which means
I should die soon, right?

491
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,792
Yes.

492
00:18:06,834 --> 00:18:08,959
But I've been a doctor
longer than you've been alive.

493
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,500
And I know sometimes,
greater forces are at work.

494
00:18:12,542 --> 00:18:14,500
Are you talking about faith?

495
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:15,959
I'm saying,
I'm a crotchety old broad

496
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,041
and I don't accept
your diagnosis.

497
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,834
I'm not even
your patient anymore.

498
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,917
Don't you have traumas
to deal with?

499
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:24,500
It's my day off, and i'm
partial to crotchety old broads.

500
00:18:24,542 --> 00:18:26,542
Then deal, and let's
make it interesting.

501
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:29,291
A buck a point.

502
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,458
Don't do it.

503
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,583
Do what?

504
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:46,542
You're going to stare
at Henry

505
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,917
so that he can
make you feel better.

506
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:50,041
He's a baby. Babies need
to be checked on.

507
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,667
He's a sleeping baby,

508
00:18:51,709 --> 00:18:55,041
and sleeping babies
need to be left alone.

509
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:59,125
All right.

510
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,041
Okay, so which thing is it?

511
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,458
Because no person
in your situation

512
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,542
would be able to sleep
right now.

513
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,083
Did you see how Donna
went after judi

514
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:06,542
right in front of us?

515
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:09,333
And then she--she referred to
herself as Henry's grandmother.

516
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:10,542
It doesn't matter
what she calls herself.

517
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,041
You're his mother.
You're damn right I am.

518
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,709
And I would do anything
for my boy.

519
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,959
I'd walk through fire.

520
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,166
I would give up all my limbs--
every limb.

521
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:21,166
And why,
why the hell didn't...

522
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,917
I stay in better touch
with Vivian?

523
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:25,542
It wouldn't change
her diagnosis.

524
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:26,792
You don't know that.

525
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:28,625
Wait. You can cure cancer?
That--that's awesome.

526
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,583
Oh, shut up.
Everyone just wants me to be--

527
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,709
why...

528
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,750
Is this happening to me?

529
00:19:34,792 --> 00:19:37,291
I mean, why is all of this
happening to me?

530
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:40,041
My--my lawyer says that
we can't win in court

531
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,542
so I should go into mediation

532
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:42,750
and act contrite
so we can settle.

533
00:19:42,792 --> 00:19:44,542
She can't even speak
in mediation.

534
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,000
Not that she would get
a word in edgewise.

535
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,625
Okay, but no, I just--

536
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:48,875
it's too much, Jake. Okay?

537
00:19:48,917 --> 00:19:50,583
I can't lose my son
and I can't have Vivian die

538
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,792
and I cannot settle
for millions

539
00:19:52,834 --> 00:19:55,000
when I haven't done
anything wrong.

540
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:57,000
You will not lose your son,

541
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,750
Vivian will die someday--
we all will--

542
00:19:58,792 --> 00:20:01,041
and you didn't
do anything wrong.

543
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:03,625
But as doctors, we have
a tendency to go in fighting,

544
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:06,417
and if we just opened ourselves
up to hearing the other side,

545
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,417
then the--the amount of money
in lawsuits,

546
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,417
the level of hostility,
it--it might all change.

547
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,750
I didn't do anything wrong.

548
00:20:12,792 --> 00:20:14,667
No, you didn't,
but regardless,

549
00:20:14,709 --> 00:20:16,583
if there were a way
to make Gwen's life easier,

550
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:19,041
wouldn't you do it?

551
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,417
Because you're not just
a doctor, Addison.

552
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,458
You're a mother, a mother
who would walk through fire

553
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,917
and give up her limbs.

554
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:28,834
But maybe, just maybe,
so is Sean.

555
00:20:33,417 --> 00:20:34,625
You lost?

556
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:35,792
E.R.'s on the first floor.

557
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:37,625
Actually,
I was looking for you.

558
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:39,041
I have
a 74-year-old patient,

559
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,834
stage iv gastric cancer.

560
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:43,250
She's been on fentanyl,
but it's not enough.

561
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,083
What do you think about
spinal cord stimulation

562
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,583
or intrathecal pain pumps?

563
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,625
I think they're both terrific
options for pain management.

564
00:20:48,667 --> 00:20:49,583
Great. Well--

565
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,041
but not for
a 74-year-old woman

566
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,834
with stage iv gastric cancer.

567
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,583
Surgically implanting
a device at this point,

568
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,041
it's too invasive.

569
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:57,667
She might not survive
the procedure.

570
00:20:57,709 --> 00:21:01,750
Yeah, I figured
it was a long shot.

571
00:21:01,792 --> 00:21:03,208
This a relative of yours?

572
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,750
Never met her
before yesterday,

573
00:21:04,792 --> 00:21:06,500
but she's just
one of those patients.

574
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:07,875
I don't know.

575
00:21:07,917 --> 00:21:10,250
I just wanted to help.
Anyway, thanks.

576
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,709
How long does she have?

577
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,333
Could be hours.
Could be weeks.

578
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,542
Maybe a month.
Not more.

579
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,583
But she doesn't have
an advanced directive,

580
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,375
won't consider hospice.

581
00:21:31,417 --> 00:21:32,875
You know her, so I figured

582
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:35,709
maybe you could get her
to stop being so stubborn.

583
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,709
Sorry.

584
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,291
Um... I need
to talk to you

585
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,792
if that's all right.

586
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:44,792
I'll catch up with you later.

587
00:21:44,834 --> 00:21:47,041
James.

588
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:48,750
Thanks.

589
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:02,625
It is not all right.

590
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:04,041
You can't do this.
What?

591
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:05,709
You can't show up
at my work.

592
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,000
You cannot ambush me
with your mother.

593
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:10,333
You are not a child.
You made a choice.

594
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:14,333
And I will always be grateful,
but you have to stop now.

595
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,625
Stop ambushing me

596
00:22:16,667 --> 00:22:17,834
or I will disappear.

597
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:20,041
I will pack up Henry,
and I will move,

598
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:21,333
and I swear to god,

599
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:24,792
you will never even see
a picture of my son.

600
00:22:26,542 --> 00:22:27,709
I'm sorry.

601
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,375
I'm really sorry. I d--

602
00:22:29,417 --> 00:22:31,709
I didn't realize...

603
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,750
I was just
coming here to say

604
00:22:33,792 --> 00:22:37,041
that I can't
see Henry anymore.

605
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:40,417
It's too hard
and it hurts too much.

606
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:41,834
So...

607
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:44,417
I just--
I wanted to say thank you.

608
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:45,667
You're a great mom.

609
00:22:45,709 --> 00:22:48,041
You're a great person.

610
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:51,458
And...
And I'm sorry.

611
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,041
I won't bother you again.

612
00:23:06,417 --> 00:23:07,625
My job as mediator is
to facilitate a conversation

613
00:23:07,667 --> 00:23:08,875
between the two of you.

614
00:23:08,917 --> 00:23:10,458
I'll start with questions,
okay?

615
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,041
Addison, how many in utero
spina bifida surgeries

616
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:14,458
do you do in a year?

617
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,375
A handful.
Five, sometimes more.

618
00:23:17,417 --> 00:23:20,000
Please explain to Sean why you
believed, with your treatment,

619
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:22,041
Gwen would be able to walk.

620
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:26,041
By repairing the spinal column
while the fetus is gestating,

621
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:28,041
you increase the likelihood
of muscle tone developing

622
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:29,792
in the lower extremities.

623
00:23:29,834 --> 00:23:31,041
And judging by Gwen's chart,

624
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:33,041
it looks like
she's starting to walk.

625
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:35,166
She hoists herself up
out of her wheelchair

626
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:36,834
with her arms,

627
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:38,041
hovers for five minutes,

628
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,375
and falls back
into her chair exhausted.

629
00:23:40,417 --> 00:23:43,041
I don't know what that is,
but it's not walking.

630
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:44,041
Sean, by suing Addison

631
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:45,417
for the wrongful birth of
your child,

632
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,041
you're saying that
if you had understood

633
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:50,291
Gwen would never be
completely ambulatory,

634
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:52,041
you would have terminated
your pregnancy.

635
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:53,917
Is that correct?

636
00:23:53,959 --> 00:23:55,875
It's not just the walking.

637
00:23:55,917 --> 00:23:58,041
Gwen will never have
a normal life

638
00:23:58,083 --> 00:23:59,458
because you lied to me.

639
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,041
I did my job.

640
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:02,208
You're not happy with the way
your life turned out,

641
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,041
and you're looking
for someone to blame.

642
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:05,041
You are to blame.

643
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:07,500
You didn't prepare us
for this reality.

644
00:24:07,542 --> 00:24:09,041
I know you didn't prepare us

645
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:11,041
because my husband left
before Gwen was 2.

646
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:14,500
He wasn't prepared.
I wasn't prepared.

647
00:24:14,542 --> 00:24:17,125
And now I have spent
every day of my life

648
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:19,166
since Gwen was born
caring for her,

649
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:22,000
feeding her, clothing her,
wiping her.

650
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:25,041
And I will spend every day
of my life doing that

651
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:27,041
until I die or she dies.

652
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:29,500
You begged me to save
your daughter, and I did.

653
00:24:29,542 --> 00:24:31,041
Taking care of your child,

654
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:33,291
dealing with pain
and disappointment,

655
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:35,500
being afraid every second,
every day--

656
00:24:35,542 --> 00:24:37,041
that is motherhood.

657
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:39,041
I didn't think it was my job
to explain that to you,

658
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:40,959
but clearly,
you don't have a clue,

659
00:24:41,041 --> 00:24:42,458
because no mother
could come here and do this.

660
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,959
No mother could ever say that
her child shouldn't exist.

661
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,750
You will not
call me a bad mother.

662
00:24:47,792 --> 00:24:50,291
You will not
make me into a villain

663
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:52,542
because you are the one
who is heartless.

664
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:55,041
And when I take your ass
to court,

665
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:57,792
the jury will agree.

666
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:12,792
You're a dear.

667
00:25:12,834 --> 00:25:14,083
How's your pain level
today?

668
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:16,125
How was mediation?

669
00:25:16,166 --> 00:25:17,917
You're deflecting.

670
00:25:17,959 --> 00:25:19,041
In fact, I am.

671
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:24,041
Well, I attempted to
play nice and hold my tongue,

672
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:25,625
but the truth is,
I didn't make a mistake,

673
00:25:25,667 --> 00:25:27,041
and the woman who's suing me
is a bitch,

674
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:28,458
and I don't feel like
listening to her

675
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,000
complain about
her life anymore.

676
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:32,792
Why is it nowadays
everyone thinks

677
00:25:32,834 --> 00:25:35,834
people need to understand
their emotions?

678
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:39,041
Everyone has so many feelings.
It's absurd.

679
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:40,834
Aw.

680
00:25:40,875 --> 00:25:43,041
I've worked my whole life
to become a great doctor,

681
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,000
and now my reputation's
being threatened.

682
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:46,375
And what's even worse,

683
00:25:46,417 --> 00:25:48,375
there's only a few people
who do what I do.

684
00:25:48,417 --> 00:25:50,041
So if I can't
practice medicine,

685
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:52,375
there will
literally be babies...

686
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:54,625
That won't get saved.

687
00:25:54,667 --> 00:25:56,667
I know
that sounds egotistical--

688
00:25:56,709 --> 00:26:00,041
oh, don't you ever backpedal
your ego with me, missy.

689
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:01,333
You're my student.

690
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:04,875
You deserve every bit
of that pride.

691
00:26:04,917 --> 00:26:07,000
Vivian...

692
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:13,417
It's time to put
your affairs in order.

693
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:15,166
You know that, right?

694
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:17,041
Did judi end up
coming back?

695
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:19,417
You're deflecting again.

696
00:26:20,834 --> 00:26:22,709
Yes, she did, and she brought
a surprise guest--

697
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,709
her mother.

698
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,041
That must have been
uncomfortable.

699
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:29,041
I think
it was harder for judi.

700
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:33,083
I don't think her mother
approves of her giving Henry up.

701
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:35,125
Mothers try to protect
their children.

702
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:37,250
But sometimes in the process,

703
00:26:37,291 --> 00:26:40,041
they do a lot of damage.

704
00:26:40,083 --> 00:26:42,375
What did your mother do?

705
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:46,083
Before you leave
the maternity home,

706
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:51,041
they let you hold your baby
for 30 minutes to say good-bye.

707
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:54,041
Everything I'd know
about my daughter,

708
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:56,041
everything she'd know
about me...

709
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:58,667
Would come
in that 30 minutes.

710
00:26:58,709 --> 00:27:00,208
I practiced
what I'd say to her

711
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:04,041
while I crocheted
a pair of baby booties.

712
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:07,250
But... before
they brought her in,

713
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:11,750
my mother showed up
to take me home.

714
00:27:11,792 --> 00:27:16,041
And when sister Jo
brought my baby...

715
00:27:16,083 --> 00:27:18,750
My mother
sent them both away.

716
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:25,041
I wanted to hold my baby.

717
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:27,542
I wanted to be her mother.

718
00:27:27,583 --> 00:27:29,709
But what kind of life

719
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:32,959
would I have been able
to give her anyway?

720
00:27:34,083 --> 00:27:36,041
Medicine...

721
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:38,959
That became my life's work,

722
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,041
and looking after
a few special students,

723
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:43,417
like you.

724
00:27:45,458 --> 00:27:48,041
Did you ever forgive
your mother?

725
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,417
She did what she thought
was best for me.

726
00:27:50,458 --> 00:27:53,125
The truth is,
I had to thank her.

727
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:56,041
I was the only female surgeon
in my class.

728
00:27:56,083 --> 00:27:59,083
The male residents
just tortured me.

729
00:28:00,458 --> 00:28:03,041
But it rolled off
my back.

730
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:06,041
After your mother
calls you a whore,

731
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:08,041
nothing else hurts.

732
00:28:08,083 --> 00:28:10,834
Oh, where did you find...

733
00:28:10,875 --> 00:28:12,041
The strength?

734
00:28:12,083 --> 00:28:14,834
We're women, honey.

735
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:17,041
The strength finds us.

736
00:28:26,667 --> 00:28:28,041
What are you doing here?

737
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:29,125
I just want to talk.

738
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:32,041
I am done talking to you.

739
00:28:34,917 --> 00:28:37,041
She's a fighter.

740
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:40,000
She's been working on
taking her first step

741
00:28:40,041 --> 00:28:41,333
for over a year.

742
00:28:41,375 --> 00:28:44,041
Sean, there's no way
you would've terminated.

743
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:46,417
I went back
and looked at your chart.

744
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:47,917
You'd been trying for years.

745
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:49,375
Three rounds of I.V.F.
With no luck

746
00:28:49,417 --> 00:28:51,083
until you and your husband
quit trying,

747
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:52,291
and then
the miracle happened.

748
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:53,709
You got pregnant.

749
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:57,000
There's no way
you would've had an abortion.

750
00:28:57,041 --> 00:28:58,041
Do you have kids?
Yes.

751
00:28:58,083 --> 00:28:59,250
Do they have special needs?

752
00:28:59,291 --> 00:29:00,875
No, but--

753
00:29:00,917 --> 00:29:02,041
you're a wealthy doctor
with a perfect child.

754
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:03,625
You don't get to judge me.

755
00:29:03,667 --> 00:29:05,041
But you are judging me.

756
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:06,083
You're putting my life
on trial.

757
00:29:06,125 --> 00:29:08,667
You're trying to
take me down for money

758
00:29:08,709 --> 00:29:10,291
when you know
I didn't make a mistake.

759
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:12,041
What do you want from me?

760
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,041
I have to take care of her.

761
00:29:14,083 --> 00:29:15,875
I got laid off.

762
00:29:15,917 --> 00:29:18,709
The hospital where I work
cut the social worker staff,

763
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,709
and I got laid off.

764
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:23,041
Something has gotta give for me
to be able to make ends meet,

765
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:25,125
and it cannot be
her medical care

766
00:29:25,166 --> 00:29:27,041
or rent or food.

767
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:30,667
Look at her.

768
00:29:30,709 --> 00:29:32,709
She's amazing.

769
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:35,917
And of course I don't
regret having her.

770
00:29:35,959 --> 00:29:38,542
What else can I do?

771
00:29:40,542 --> 00:29:43,041
Someday Gwen's gonna find out
where that money came from,

772
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:44,917
and it will destroy her.

773
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:47,500
Look, mommy. Look!

774
00:29:47,542 --> 00:29:49,041
I'm walking, mommy.

775
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:51,542
You are, baby!
You are.

776
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:55,041
I am so proud of you.

777
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:03,542
Oh, my god.
That is better than sex.

778
00:30:03,583 --> 00:30:06,000
Okay, I'm gonna pretend
you didn't say that.

779
00:30:06,041 --> 00:30:07,542
Okay.

780
00:30:07,583 --> 00:30:08,500
I figured it out.

781
00:30:08,542 --> 00:30:10,250
Remember that time
we went sailing

782
00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:11,750
and you didn't get seasick?

783
00:30:11,792 --> 00:30:12,959
Mm-hmm.

784
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,333
And on the beach,
found this Rose quartz?

785
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:15,500
Mm-hmm.

786
00:30:15,542 --> 00:30:16,917
It's basically treasure.

787
00:30:16,959 --> 00:30:20,041
Your parents are pirates.

788
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:21,125
Jewish pirates?

789
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:22,583
Maybe not even Jewish.

790
00:30:22,625 --> 00:30:25,041
I was adopted through
a Jewish agency.

791
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:26,542
I'm Jewish.

792
00:30:26,583 --> 00:30:27,500
But if we found
your real parents,

793
00:30:27,542 --> 00:30:29,041
we could vacationing
on their--

794
00:30:29,083 --> 00:30:30,583
okay, I gr--i grew up
with my real parents.

795
00:30:30,625 --> 00:30:32,542
I think what you meant
is they're my biological--
you have more.

796
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:34,750
I mean, how could you
not want to meet them?

797
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:36,750
Okay, Mason.

798
00:30:36,792 --> 00:30:40,375
Some questions, even when they
come from just being curious,

799
00:30:40,417 --> 00:30:41,917
they can be hurtful.

800
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:44,000
You need to think about
the person you're asking

801
00:30:44,041 --> 00:30:46,083
and how it might
affect 'em.

802
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:48,959
I'm sorry, dad.
I wasn't trying to be mean.

803
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,417
I know, sweetie.

804
00:30:50,458 --> 00:30:52,500
It's just, all those years
I spent with mom

805
00:30:52,542 --> 00:30:53,959
and nobody else.

806
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,959
I wondered about you.

807
00:30:57,041 --> 00:31:00,041
I get that. I do.

808
00:31:00,083 --> 00:31:02,333
And it's not like I haven't
wondered about my birth mother.

809
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:03,583
Of course I have.

810
00:31:03,625 --> 00:31:05,583
I even made up
a life for her, too.

811
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:07,250
She's happily married,
she's got three kids,

812
00:31:07,291 --> 00:31:10,250
she teaches third grade
in a suburb of Dayton.

813
00:31:10,291 --> 00:31:13,208
Look, there's a lot of people
who were adopted

814
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:14,667
who want to find
their biological parents.

815
00:31:14,709 --> 00:31:16,208
It just...

816
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:18,417
It was never me.

817
00:31:18,458 --> 00:31:20,750
To me, my parents are the ones
who checked my homework

818
00:31:20,792 --> 00:31:22,250
and stayed up with me
when I was sick

819
00:31:22,291 --> 00:31:23,750
and made me feel like

820
00:31:23,792 --> 00:31:26,375
I was the most important thing
in the world to them.

821
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:28,041
They're my family,

822
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:30,000
like Charlotte
is family to you.

823
00:31:30,041 --> 00:31:33,250
Blood doesn't make a family.
Love does.

824
00:31:34,917 --> 00:31:37,375
That makes sense.

825
00:31:37,417 --> 00:31:39,166
But can we still
get the triplets

826
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:41,667
their own pirate hats?

827
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:50,625
Vitals aren't so good,
are they?

828
00:31:50,667 --> 00:31:51,834
They're fine.

829
00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:54,041
You need to become
a better liar.

830
00:31:55,542 --> 00:31:57,041
Do you have a wife?

831
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:58,583
I haven't found
the lucky girl yet.

832
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:01,500
If only I were
40 years younger.

833
00:32:01,542 --> 00:32:03,625
I was a real beauty
back then.

834
00:32:03,667 --> 00:32:04,542
You still are.

835
00:32:04,583 --> 00:32:06,417
No flirting
with the patients.

836
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:08,250
Don't listen to her.

837
00:32:08,291 --> 00:32:09,750
I'm not easily discouraged.

838
00:32:09,792 --> 00:32:12,000
I'll check on you later,
okay?

839
00:32:13,667 --> 00:32:15,417
Did you find the stationery?

840
00:32:15,458 --> 00:32:17,041
Mission accomplished.

841
00:32:17,083 --> 00:32:20,083
I need you
to write me a letter.

842
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:22,250
Okay.

843
00:32:22,291 --> 00:32:23,834
Use your best penmanship.

844
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:25,959
Make it legible.

845
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,542
All right.
No messy doctor scribble.

846
00:32:30,583 --> 00:32:35,041

Hey.

Um...
What are you doing here?

916
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,917
I'm not really sure,
exactly.

917
00:35:43,959 --> 00:35:46,041
I read, uh,
when you adopt a baby,

918
00:35:46,083 --> 00:35:48,959
you're supposed to give
the birth mother something.

919
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,458
Not... that I could ever

920
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,917
give you anything that compares
to what you gave me.

921
00:35:53,959 --> 00:35:56,333
But I, um...

922
00:35:56,375 --> 00:36:00,000
I got you this.

923
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:10,375
I mean, I don't even...
Do you even like gold?

924
00:36:10,417 --> 00:36:12,041
Uh, should I have
gotten you silver?

925
00:36:12,083 --> 00:36:14,041
No. I like it.

926
00:36:14,083 --> 00:36:17,291
I-I do.

927
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:20,041
Please don't stop
seeing Henry.

928
00:36:20,083 --> 00:36:22,834
Henry shouldn't be
around me.

929
00:36:22,875 --> 00:36:25,208
When he's old enough
to understand what I did,

930
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,500
he'll hate me.

931
00:36:26,542 --> 00:36:27,709
No, he won't.
He couldn't.

932
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,583
What you did was put
his welfare above your own,

933
00:36:29,625 --> 00:36:31,959
because that's
what a mother does.

934
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,834
I'm not his mother.
You are.

935
00:36:33,875 --> 00:36:35,375
No, that's what
I'm trying to say.

936
00:36:35,417 --> 00:36:37,458
We both are.

937
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,458
You, Henry, and I,
we're connected now.

938
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,041
We're family.

939
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:44,041
And I get that it's hard,

940
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:45,542
and if you need a break,
that's okay.

941
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:46,750
Or if it's just too much,
that's okay.

942
00:36:46,792 --> 00:36:48,125
But you need to know,

943
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:49,458
you have to know,

944
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:53,458
that you will always
be welcome in his home,

945
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,125
in our home.

946
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:01,250
Um...

947
00:37:01,291 --> 00:37:03,417
My break
is in ten minutes...

948
00:37:03,458 --> 00:37:07,250
And the blueberry pie here
is really good.

949
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:10,041
Maybe if you ordered
two pieces, we could--

950
00:37:10,083 --> 00:37:12,583
I'd love that.

951
00:37:19,834 --> 00:37:21,000
I'm glad you both
reconsidered mediation.

952
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:23,041
I think if you try to truly
listen to one another--

953
00:37:23,083 --> 00:37:25,041
I want to settle.

954
00:37:25,083 --> 00:37:26,166
What?

955
00:37:26,208 --> 00:37:27,291
Let's stop all this.

956
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:29,041
Pick a number,
and I'll pay it.

957
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:30,000
But why would you--

958
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:31,583
Gwen needs to be
taken care of.

959
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:33,208
What you've been through--
I can't change what happened,

960
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,917
but I can help.

961
00:37:34,959 --> 00:37:36,667
Let me help.

962
00:37:36,709 --> 00:37:38,041
I can't.

963
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:39,834
No, it's okay.
Talk to your lawyer,

964
00:37:39,875 --> 00:37:41,041
and I'll make it work.

965
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:42,834
No, you don't understand.

966
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,917
You were right.

967
00:37:49,375 --> 00:37:51,834
Gwen can never think
I didn't want her.

968
00:37:51,875 --> 00:37:53,834
And if go th--

969
00:37:57,583 --> 00:38:00,041
You didn't do anything wrong.

970
00:38:00,083 --> 00:38:03,041
I can't take your money.

971
00:38:21,083 --> 00:38:24,041
When?

972
00:38:24,083 --> 00:38:25,333
About an hour ago.

973
00:38:25,375 --> 00:38:27,333
I texted you.

974
00:38:30,834 --> 00:38:34,375
I was in mediation.

975
00:38:34,417 --> 00:38:36,208
I'm sorry, Addison.

976
00:38:38,041 --> 00:38:40,250
Thank you.

977
00:38:40,291 --> 00:38:42,500
She had that light
inside of her that...

978
00:38:42,542 --> 00:38:44,542
Made you want to catch
every word she said.

979
00:38:45,834 --> 00:38:47,000
My grandmother had that.

980
00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:48,625
She used to wake up
every morning

981
00:38:48,667 --> 00:38:51,917
and wave up at the sky
and say good morning to the sun,

982
00:38:51,959 --> 00:38:54,542
fed the rabbits table scraps.

983
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:57,959
Drove my grandfather nuts
'cause they tore up the garden.

984
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,250
She died of cancer, too.

985
00:39:01,291 --> 00:39:02,959
I wish I'd gotten to spend

986
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,625
more time with my grandmother
when she was dying.

987
00:39:05,667 --> 00:39:07,041

Good. Uh...

1048
00:41:46,125 --> 00:41:48,834
You know,
she invited me inside,

1049
00:41:48,875 --> 00:41:51,125
and we talked about Vivian.

1050
00:41:51,166 --> 00:41:54,625
She's led a full...

1051
00:41:54,667 --> 00:41:58,041

1052
00:41:58,083 --> 00:42:00,792

on my face or something?

1056
00:42:12,792 --> 00:42:14,041
What?

1057
00:42:14,083 --> 00:42:16,333
I love you.

1058
00:42:16,375 --> 00:42:19,083

I want to say that to.
