14

We're practically kin.

and I suspect you think
you don't want this job

18
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:14,291
because you're a u.S.C. Hotshot
at a level one trauma center,

19
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:18,041
and St. ambrose is,
relatively speaking, a...

20
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:20,917

21
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:23,041

At a level one trauma center,

22

24

150
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:29,041

more x-rays, but...

151
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,875

Look, I-I get that

153
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,083

my residency five years ago.

154

at St. ambrose.

155
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,041
We don't need a skeletal series.
I know this family.

156
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,875
I've been taking care of Sarah
since she was born.

157
00:06:44,917 --> 00:06:46,166
So you're probably
not objective.

158
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:47,500
She's had three injuries
in two months.

159
00:06:47,542 --> 00:06:49,083
Sounds a lot like abuse
to me.

160
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,583
No, it's not.

161
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,417
I've been taking care of kids
for 20 years.

162
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,709
If there was something wrong
here, I would know it.

163
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,834
Look, she's a kid,
and she fell down.

164
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,500
I mean, didn't you ever
play outside?

165
00:06:58,542 --> 00:07:00,041
I used to come home
with scrapes and bruises.

166
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:02,125

my parents of neglect.

167
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,333
You were lucky to grow up
in such idyllic times.

168
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:07,500
Look, the protocols are
rigid and clear for a reason.

169
00:07:07,542 --> 00:07:09,083
Any suspicion, you file
a report with d.C.F.S.

170
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,667
They come in, evaluate,
and decide.

171
00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:13,083
That way,
no mistakes are made.

172
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:14,667
And as soon as you file
that report,

173
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:17,041
you subject this family
to unwarranted scrutiny.

174
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,417
It's my job.

175
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:22,041
Hey. Okay. Okay, look.
I'm sorry, I...

176
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:24,625
I'm attached to this family.
I probably overreacted.

177
00:07:24,667 --> 00:07:25,917
Let me make a call.
Okay?

178
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:28,333
I-I've been down this road.
I can expedite it.

179
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,542
We need the bed,
and I appreciate it.

180
00:07:40,917 --> 00:07:43,250
It's time to get him
back into his own bed.

181
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,375
Thank you, Clara.
I'm sorry I was late.

182
00:07:45,417 --> 00:07:47,583
When you let him sleep
in your bed,

183
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:50,458
it makes it impossible for me
to put him to sleep in his own.

184
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,667
He needs structure,

185
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:54,583
perhaps even more now
that his father--

186
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,041
what he needs in the wake
of his father's death

187
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,875
is psychologically debatable.

188
00:07:57,917 --> 00:07:59,917
Thank you, Clara.

189
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:02,458
Your opinion is noted,
and I will consider it.

190
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,500
Good night.

191
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,333
Oh, come on.

192
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,667
Clara?

193
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,083
Yes?

194
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,917
I'm sorry
I took a tone with you.

195
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:26,917
I really do appreciate
your input.

196
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:28,709
I know you've been here
a lot more since Pete,

197
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,000
and I-I do appreciate--
you've been paged back to work,
haven't you?

198
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,959
You're only
at 4 centimeters, Pam,

199
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,375
so it's gonna be
a while yet.

200
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:38,917
Crap.

201
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:40,208
Maybe this time we'll get
the girl you always wanted.

202
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,583
Not a chance.
Your sperm is totally sexist.

203
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,959
My. Reiter,
your X-ray is clear.

204
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,417
Yeah, I'm better now.
My legs have stopped tingling.

205
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,750
See? Everything works.

206
00:08:48,792 --> 00:08:50,375
Until it doesn't, right?
Am I missing something here?

207
00:08:50,417 --> 00:08:51,583
Addison Montgomery.

208
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:52,792
James Peterson.

209
00:08:52,834 --> 00:08:54,125
Welcome, Dr. Peterson.

210
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,333
What you're missing is
that Todd here tends to develop

211
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:59,041
sympathetic symptoms with
each of his wife's pregnancies.

212
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,333
This is our fourth.
The first one, he got rashes.

213
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:04,041
Itched like crazy.
Second kid, abdominal cramps.

214
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:06,458
Worse than my labor pains. You
should've heard the man scream.

215
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,041
And the third one
was fainting spells.

216
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,625
I had to pick him up
off the l&amp;D floor.

217
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:12,583
Scalp lac, 14 stitches.

218
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,625
You're gonna have to stay down
here just a little while longer.

219
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:17,667
It's crazy tonight. But I'll get
you upstairs as soon as I can.

220
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:19,917
All the previous symptoms--
they just got better?

221
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:23,000
Soon as the babies came.
I call it fun with crazy.

222
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,166
I'd still like to get
a neuro consult.

223
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:28,041
He's fine. He's a pain
in my ass, but he's fine.

224
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:30,083
It'd make me feel better
to have the consult.

225
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,041
And it gives me an excuse
to keep checking on you, too.

226
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,583
Mm. Careful, Todd.

227
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,792
I might leave here with a baby
and a new husband.

228
00:09:35,834 --> 00:09:38,083
What are you doing here?

229
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,041
I told dad I could
stay home alone.

230
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,375
He's yours?
Yep.

231
00:09:41,417 --> 00:09:42,583
What happened to hildy?

232
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,583
She's fine. Got rear-ended.

233
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,083
No one in L.A. can drive
in the rain.

234
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,291
Kid's got a point.

235
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,750
Are you Dr. Peterson?

236
00:09:48,792 --> 00:09:49,959
Yeah, but "James" is fine.

237
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,333
Dr. Shepherd. Neurosurgery.

238
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,959
You wanted a consult
on this... Todd reiter?

239
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,041
Transient weakness.
His symptoms have resolved.

240
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,625
Have him make an appointment
to see me later this week.

241
00:09:57,667 --> 00:10:00,041
On exam, he had a symmetrical
increase in his reflexes.

242
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,041
Impressive...

243
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,917
And nondiagnostic, that could be
any one of a thousand things.

244
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:06,959
Which is why I will see him
for follow-up in my office.

245
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,792
I really think he needs--
send him home.

246
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,709
I need a C.T.
of the cervical spine.

247
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,875
But she just said--

248
00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:17,041
and I said, get the C.T.

249
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,458
Okay.

250
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,959
It's game time, baby.

251
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,041
Karen.
Uh, that's him.

252
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,000
Oh. Dr. Peterson?

253
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,709
Sheldon Wallace.
You paged me about, uh...

254
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,291
Nick Calhoun, curtain 2.

255
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,041
Yeah, did he, uh...

256
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:38,959
He has a history of depression,
and, uh, I wasn't sure if, uh...

257
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,333
Attempted suicide?

258
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,291
No, he's just having an adverse
reaction to some new meds.

259
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,250
Nausea, vomiting.

260
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:47,083
He got dehydrated
and nearly passed out.

261
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,875
I'll leave you two.

262
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,709
Where you headed, the prom?

263
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,000
How you feeling?

264
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,750
Better now.

265
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:02,041
I-I don't have to stop
the treatment, do I?

266
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:04,333
Please, I'll--I'll try to be
better about staying hydrated.

267
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,500
Adverse reactions are common
when starting new drugs.

268
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:09,125
It may simply be about
altering the dosage.

269
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:11,000
Good, okay,

270
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:13,792
'cause I feel like
they're working.

271
00:11:13,834 --> 00:11:16,375
And your sexual urges,
your...

272
00:11:16,417 --> 00:11:18,083
Your thoughts of children
and your goddaughter?

273
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,208
Less.

274
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,041
I feel like
they're happening less,

275
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:24,417
and I feel like I'm getting
more control over them.

276
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:27,834
Maybe if I can just
keep taking the drugs, you know?

277
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,250
Maybe...

278
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:33,041
Well, maybe I could
end up normal.

279
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,250
It's all about progress,
Nick,

280
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,792
and you're making progress.

281
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,041
Thank you, Dr. Wallace.

282
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,041
Ooh.

283
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:47,041
Crap. Why does this hurt more
than the other three?

284
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,458
Or did I just forget again?

285
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,041
Well, it's hard to say,
but every labor is different.

286
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,041
At least for Todd.
Funny, Pam. Very funny.

287
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,041
You almost broke my hand
on that last one.

288
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:57,041
Oh, I don't feel sorry for you.

289
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,542
Hi. I'm Stephanie.
I'm your nurse.

290
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:01,041
Stephanie.
Welcome to the party.

291
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,041
Any halfway decent party
has snacks.

292
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,083
Darling, who of the two of us

293
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,041
actually needs medical attention
right now?

294
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,041
You, sweetie.
You do all the hard work.

295
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:11,041
If it weren't for you--
yeah, enough sucking up.
We need to focus.

296
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:13,417
Don't tell them the baby's sex.
They like to be surprised.

297
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,041
Ohh. How many years
have you been together?

298
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,291
Feels like... a century?

299
00:12:17,542 --> 00:12:19,291
15 years of wedded bliss.

300
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:20,917
How long has it been now
for you and Dr. Bennett?

301
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,375
Oh! No. No, uh...

302
00:12:23,417 --> 00:12:24,500
Sam and I aren't together
anymore.

303
00:12:24,542 --> 00:12:25,875
I'm seeing someone else.

304
00:12:25,917 --> 00:12:28,041
And so is he.
Mm.

305
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,041
Is she as pretty as you?

306
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,583
Prettier.

307
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,166
Thank you.

308
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:35,709
Oh! I...

309
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,333
I can't--i can't believe
I brought this up.

310
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,417
I-I-I'm... in labor.

311
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,291
You can't listen to anything
that I say, just ask Todd.

312
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,083
Way to stick your foot in it,
baby.

313
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,417
It's fine, really.
It's fine.

314
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,041
Oh, here comes another one.

315
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,709
Hand, Todd.

316
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,041
Ooh.

317
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:53,041
I'm sorry it took so long
to get a bed.

318
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,959
Not again.

319
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,041
Please.

320
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,959
Megan, i'm--I'm sorry.
You...

321
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,041
You lost the baby.

322
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,041
Oh, but we made it
to 12 weeks.

323
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,208
I know.

324
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,458
I told people.

325
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,583
There are gifts.

326
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:15,041
Megan, the miscarriage
was incomplete.

327
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:17,250
I'm going to have to
perform a d&amp;C

328
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,625
once an O.R. opens up.
All right?

329
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:25,000
Daddy's out of town.

330
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:29,166
When can we try again?

331
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:33,125
Let's take things
one step at a time. Okay?

332
00:13:38,709 --> 00:13:40,041
Excuse me.

333
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:42,625
I'm looking for Sarah Nelson.
She's a 7-year-old.

334
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:44,041
Curtain 1.

335
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,083
Are you the--
the new E.R. attending?

336
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,000
Yeah.
You're from d.C.F.S., right?

337
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:51,417
No. Uh, Dr. Turner.
Psychiatry.

338
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,375
Vi, Sarah's this way.

339
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:55,041
Psychiatry?

340
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:56,750
We agreed that d.C.F.S.
Would be called.

341
00:13:56,792 --> 00:13:58,125
No, we agreed that I would
make a call,

342
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:01,041
and Dr. Turner's more than
qualified to evaluate Sarah.

343
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,208
That's not the protocol.
Really hung up
on the protocol, huh

344
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,750
what's going on?

345
00:14:04,792 --> 00:14:06,917
Your pediatrician seems to have
trouble with the rules,

346
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,041
and, well, the truth.
Whoa. Easy there, junior.

347
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,834
Look, d.C.F.S. Could take hours.
Let me help you out with Sarah.

348
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:14,834
James, we're slammed. Violet's
a terrific psychiatrist.

349
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:17,166
Why does my kid need a shrink?
She broke her arm.

350
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:19,041
The latest in a long line
of questionable injuries.

351
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:22,250
You think I hurt my daughter?
Ron, don't worry about him
right now, okay?

352
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:23,750
There are protocols
for a reason.

353
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:26,750
- Sarah?
- Honey, are you okay?

354
00:14:26,792 --> 00:14:27,959
You okay?

355
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,458
Mommy, I'm getting a cast
on my arm.

356
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,041
Why is everybody so mad?

357
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,208
It's okay, baby. It's okay.

358
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,041
Can I take her home
after the cast?

359
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,375
Sarah's with me this weekend.

360
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,583
If you can't keep her safe,

361
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,250
then she is not gonna
be with you anymore.

362
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:42,667
I am suing you
for sole custody!
No! I wanna be with daddy, too!

363
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:44,750
Let's--let's discuss this
somewhere else.
You're not taking my daughter
away from me.

364
00:14:44,792 --> 00:14:46,333
I will do whatever it takes
to protect my baby.

365
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,041
Mommy, daddy, stop fighting!

366
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:51,041
Enough!
Everybody out of here now.

367
00:14:55,834 --> 00:14:57,709
Sorry it got
so crazy before.

368
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,917
It's okay.

369
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,000
Hey, I like your raincoat.

370
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:04,041
Purple's my favorite color.

371
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,792
Daddy bought that for me.

372
00:15:06,834 --> 00:15:10,041
You love your daddy a lot,
don't you?

373
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,458
And my mommy.

374
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,500
And they love you, too.

375
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:17,041
But sometimes they get mad
and yell?

376
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,458
They yell a lot.

377
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,834
At you?

378
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:23,041
Well...

379
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,333
Mommy did once.

380
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,333
How come?

381
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,750
I colored on the wall
in my room.

382
00:15:30,542 --> 00:15:32,542
What about your daddy?

383
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:37,041
When I'm not careful
and I hurt myself,

384
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:39,625
he says it makes him worry,

385
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:41,250
and he doesn't want
to worry.

386
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:44,417
So most of the time
when they yell,

387
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:47,834
it's at each other?

388
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,041
Yeah.

389
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,125
Has it always
been like that?

390
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,959
Just since daddy was bad.

391
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,083
Mommy won't forgive him.

392
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,500
How do you feel
when they fight?

393
00:16:04,417 --> 00:16:06,583
I wanna run away.

394
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:14,291
Damn, Sheldon.
You look like James Bond.

395
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:15,583
Yeah? Which one?

396
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,166
I was always partial
to Sean Connery.

397
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:20,041
Lytes within normal limits.
Liver enzymes look good.

398
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,041
Time to send him home.
Yeah, actually,

399
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,458
I would like to observe him for
a while. I adjusted his meds.

400
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,041
I wanna make sure that he
doesn't have another reaction.

401
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,792
We need the bed.

402
00:16:26,834 --> 00:16:28,041
Well, he's in
a very fragile state.

403
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,625
You know, he just needs
a few more hours.

404
00:16:29,667 --> 00:16:31,041
A few more hours won't make
any difference for him.

405
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,083
What does that mean?

406
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,709
I saw the chart.
I know what you prescribed.

407
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,041
Your patient can't be helped.
He's a sexual deviant.

408
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:39,166
No, he's a man afflicted
with certain... urges.

409
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,583
What's the difference?

410
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,291
So you think I should just
ignore his suffering, huh?

411
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,041
Send him on his way?
I think you should lock him up
and throw away the key.

412
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,208
Wow.

413
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,750
I guess you missed that day
in medical school

414
00:16:46,792 --> 00:16:48,041
when they discussed

415
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,500
how a physician is supposed
to heal his patients.

416
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:51,917
The ones we can,

417
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:54,041
but we also have an obligation
to society at large.

418
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,709
You know the rate
of recidivism.

419
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,417
Recidivism implies
a first offense,

420
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,041
which my patient
has not committed.

421
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,583
He tell you that?

422
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:01,834
He hasn't done anything.

423
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:04,041
Even if that's true,
we both know he will,

424
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,375
and I don't want him
infecting my E.R.

425
00:17:05,417 --> 00:17:09,000
Discharge him. The bed should
go to someone who matters.

426
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,542
Is Sarah okay?

427
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:11,750
Yeah. Yeah.

428
00:17:11,792 --> 00:17:14,041
But in order to complete
my evaluation,

429
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,667
I would like to speak
to both of you separately.

430
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:18,333
Is that really necessary?
You don't want
d.C.F.S. Involved.

431
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:21,667
Oh, my god.
This is all your fault, Ron.
Of course it is,

432
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:23,458
'cause you've never done
anything wrong in our marriage.

433
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,125
You're the one who couldn't
keep it in your pants.

434
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:28,458
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
I'm sorry, baby.
Everything's fine.

435
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,667
- Mommy's not mad at you.
- Come on.

436
00:17:30,709 --> 00:17:34,000
I guess you're starting with me.

437
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:53,458
What's going on in here?

438
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,000
I read
this really creepy story

439
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,041
where live people
got buried in the walls,

440
00:17:57,083 --> 00:18:01,041
so I'm listening to see
if anyone's in there.
Oh.

441
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:04,041
Um... it's pretty busy
around here,

442
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,000
so I doubt anybody could
get buried in a wall

443
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,917
without being noticed.

444
00:18:07,959 --> 00:18:09,333
Maybe we should just go back
to the desk?

445
00:18:11,709 --> 00:18:13,458
What happens if
you and Charlotte break up?

446
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,333
What?

447
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:18,041
That mom and dad...

448
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,291
Uh, they broke up,

449
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:22,041
and she said she was gonna
take the little girl with her.

450
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:24,542
Um, what if you and Charlotte
are like that?

451
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,500
I-I love you
'cause you're my dad,

452
00:18:26,542 --> 00:18:28,417
but I-I love Charlotte,
too.

453
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,041
And what about the babies?
What's gonna happen to them?

454
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,625
Okay, l-listen to me.

455
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:34,917
Charlotte and I have already
been through so much,

456
00:18:34,959 --> 00:18:37,041
the kind of stuff that a lot of
couples don't make it through,

457
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,250
but we did.

458
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:39,709
We made it through,

459
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,291
and we came out even stronger
and even more in love.

460
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:43,709
And you know what
that means?

461
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,041
It means we are badass.

462
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,709
We are
a badass family unit--

463
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,750
you and me and the triplets
and Charlotte,

464
00:18:50,792 --> 00:18:53,166
and nothing's gonna
change that.

465
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:56,917
Okay?
Yeah.

466
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,083
Um, we can go back
to the desk.

467
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,500

Sorry. You're just terrific,

You're one of the best

and I do not say that lightly.

Thank you.

480
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,125
Yeah. You know, I-I hope
it wasn't awkward

481
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,083
when Pam was talking
about Sam.

482
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,500
No. No. No, everybody has
a past, right?

483

Right. Yes.

You know, we are totally
in the past, Sam and me.

485
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,333
Totally. You know,
that's where it's gonna stay.

486
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,417
I mean, we've been friends
for 20 years.

487
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,083
You know, it'd be nice
to get that back.

488
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:42,917
Really?

489
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:44,041
I-I didn't--i didn't know you'd
known each other that long.

490
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,291
Oh, yeah. We went
to med school together.

491
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,041
Anyway, you're terrific,

492
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,083
and I'm glad things
aren't gonna be awkward

493
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,333
between us since we're gonna
see each other all the time.

494
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:51,875
Yeah, I'd like to be
on your rotation.

495
00:19:51,917 --> 00:19:53,375
You get
some interesting cases.

496
00:19:53,417 --> 00:19:55,041
Oh, no, no.

497
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,125
No, I meant 'cause you're
dating my next door neighbor.

498
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,041
I'm sorry?

499
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,041
Yeah, he didn't...

500
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:03,333
Um...

501
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:06,750
What--what exactly
did Sam tell you about me?

502
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:09,417
Absolutely nothing.

503
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,750
♪ Stage rise ♪

504
00:20:11,792 --> 00:20:13,041
I messed up,

505
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:16,250
and in the most cliche
and pedestrian way possible.

506
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,583
I screwed my assistant.

507
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:19,792
And you told Dana about it?

508
00:20:19,834 --> 00:20:21,375
That was my second mistake.

509
00:20:21,417 --> 00:20:23,041
So she threw me out.

510
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,375
Did you try counseling?

511
00:20:24,417 --> 00:20:26,500
Dana prefers
to focus her energy

512
00:20:26,542 --> 00:20:28,792
on staying angry at me.

513
00:20:28,834 --> 00:20:30,291
Well, infidelity can be a very
difficult thing to work through.

514
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,583
I was hoping that we could
shield Sarah from all--

515
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:35,917
you're not shielding her. You're
fighting right in front of her.

516
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:37,041
I'm fighting for her.

517
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,667
Dana keeps changing the days
I get Sarah.

518
00:20:39,709 --> 00:20:41,458
She forgets to tell me
about school events.

519
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,208
It's like she's actively trying
to keep Sarah away from me.

520
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,542
And Sarah...

521
00:20:47,917 --> 00:20:50,041

00:26:55,375 --> 00:26:57,041
I love you!
Is he gonna be okay?

694
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:59,125
Todd!

695
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:05,709
Hey. What's going on?

696
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,959
Little girl. Cooper's patient.
She's missing.

697
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:25,709
You okay?

698
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:29,500
Yeah. Yeah, I just...

699
00:27:29,542 --> 00:27:32,083
I wanted to
check up on you. Hmm.

700
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:34,250
How you feeling?

701
00:27:34,291 --> 00:27:36,750
I'm good.

702
00:27:36,792 --> 00:27:38,000
Can I go home?

703
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:44,083
Yeah. Yeah, I have your, uh,
discharge papers for you.

704
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:46,125
Here you go.

705
00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:53,834
So they can't find
that little girl?

706
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:57,500
I heard all the noise.

707
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:59,000
No.

708
00:28:00,834 --> 00:28:04,000
No, she's still missing.

709
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,500
Look...

710
00:28:09,542 --> 00:28:10,792
I'm sorry.

711
00:28:10,834 --> 00:28:14,041
All right? I was worried.

712
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:16,208
But it doesn't mean
the medication isn't working.

713
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:17,959
You know, and it--and it doesn't
mean that I-I don't--

714
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,041
it's okay. I get it.

715
00:28:22,083 --> 00:28:23,875
I would've thought
it was me, too.

716
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,792
I'll see you next week.

717
00:28:31,834 --> 00:28:35,041
Yeah.

718
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:36,875
Todd's gonna make it, right?

719
00:28:36,917 --> 00:28:38,458
Hang in there, Pam.

720
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,041
I feel dizzy.

721
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:41,542
B.p.'s only 70 palp.

722
00:28:41,583 --> 00:28:44,417
That spinal bolus must've
bottomed out her pressure.

723
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:46,041
Give her--
ephedrine, 5 milligrams.

724
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:48,583
Slow I.V. Push. Going in.

725
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:50,041
I'll run in a fluid bolus.

726
00:28:50,083 --> 00:28:51,875
We can get this baby
out now.

727
00:28:51,917 --> 00:28:54,375
Need an extra set of hands?
Yeah. There's blood everywhere.

728
00:28:54,417 --> 00:28:56,041
Must've been
a uterine artery laceration.

729
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:57,208
Okay, suction.

730
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:58,583
Oh vicryl.

731
00:28:58,625 --> 00:29:00,875
I'm gonna hand-tie
the vessel.

732
00:29:00,917 --> 00:29:02,417
Pressure's still down.

733
00:29:02,458 --> 00:29:03,875
Come on, baby. Breathe.

734
00:29:03,917 --> 00:29:06,000
Okay, got it.
Bleeding has stopped.

735
00:29:06,041 --> 00:29:07,083
Pam's pressure's coming up.

736
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:09,041
What's happening?

737
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:10,792
Come on, breathe. Breathe.

738
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:12,291
What's wrong? Is my baby okay?

739
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:16,041
That's a girl! Good girl!

740
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:17,041
A girl?

741
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:18,917
We have a girl?

742
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:30,500
I got it.

743
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,500
It's okay. Come on.

744
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,792
Hey.

745
00:29:55,834 --> 00:29:57,041
Yeah.

746
00:29:57,083 --> 00:29:58,166
You okay?

747
00:29:58,208 --> 00:30:00,667
Yeah. You guys have
a lot more channels here

748
00:30:00,709 --> 00:30:02,000
than we do at home.

749
00:30:04,166 --> 00:30:06,125
Come here.

750
00:30:08,291 --> 00:30:10,333
- Mm.
- What--what's wrong?

751
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:12,917
Can't a father
give a son a hug?

752
00:30:14,083 --> 00:30:15,875
I can't breathe.

753
00:30:22,709 --> 00:30:25,500
Something happened,
didn't it?

754
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:30,542
My... patient,
that little girl--

755
00:30:30,583 --> 00:30:33,709
she, um... is missing
from the E.R.

756
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:37,041
You want me to help
look for her?

757
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,959
We can look together.

758
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:51,417
Oh, Stephanie.
I've been looking for you.

759
00:30:51,458 --> 00:30:53,709
I'm busy.
Whoa. Wait. Hold up.
Steph, wait.

760
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,041
Let me explain myself.

761
00:30:55,083 --> 00:30:56,333
Okay.
Give it your best shot.

762
00:30:56,375 --> 00:31:00,000
All right. Uh...

763
00:31:03,083 --> 00:31:05,250
Ugh. Save it, Sam.
I'm working.
S-Stephanie.

764
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:10,959
Hey. D--um, thank you
for your help with Pam.

765
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,041
Did an O.R. open up
for Megan?

766
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:13,166
I'm headed over there now.

767
00:31:13,208 --> 00:31:14,458
Jake, how many more times

768
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,667
are you gonna let her
go through this?

769
00:31:15,709 --> 00:31:17,041
I mean, you saw her.
She's devastated.

770
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,875
And every time,
it's just gonna get worse.

771
00:31:18,917 --> 00:31:21,041
You don't know Megan,
all right? I do.

772
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:23,041
Megan and Danny have been trying
to get pregnant for years.

773
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:25,250
Met with every fertility doctor
across the country,

774
00:31:25,291 --> 00:31:27,125
who all said
it was a long shot.

775
00:31:27,166 --> 00:31:28,667
I told them
I like a long shot,

776
00:31:28,709 --> 00:31:30,500
so they moved here
because of me.

777
00:31:30,542 --> 00:31:32,208
Yeah, but some women
just can't get pregnant.

778
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:33,625
Not if you give up on them.

779
00:31:33,667 --> 00:31:35,375
I don't give up on my patients,
but this is insane

780
00:31:35,417 --> 00:31:38,041
because you are
playing the odds way too far

781
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:39,709
in favor of doing
more damage than good,

782
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,792
and your patient is the one
who will suffer.

783
00:31:41,834 --> 00:31:43,875
Look, Addison, you may
be very good at what you do,

784
00:31:43,917 --> 00:31:45,667
but I am excellent
at what I do--

785
00:31:45,709 --> 00:31:47,375
one of the best
in the country.

786
00:31:47,417 --> 00:31:48,834
I didn't ask you
for your opinion,

787
00:31:48,875 --> 00:31:50,667
and I don't want it.

788
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,667
How they doing?

789
00:32:06,709 --> 00:32:08,208
How would you be?

790
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:10,542
I just gave Dana a sedative,
but Ron didn't want one.

791
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:12,083
He wants to stay clear.

792
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:14,291
I'm putting a g.P.S. On Mason
for reals.

793
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:18,041
I know. I just called the nanny
three times, checking on Lucas.

794
00:32:19,959 --> 00:32:21,625
This new guy's a douche.

795
00:32:21,667 --> 00:32:22,834
He's just doing his job.

796
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:24,250
Well, Pete did it better.

797
00:32:25,709 --> 00:32:28,041
You okay?

798
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:30,208
Well, I'm the one
who told Charlotte

799
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:32,125
to hire his replacement.

800
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:35,041
I can't very well
get mad at her for doing it.

801
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:37,041
But now, I mean, I...

802
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:39,000
Seeing him here,
right in front of me...

803
00:32:42,083 --> 00:32:43,959
He should be Pete.

804
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,291
Hey. Any news about
the missing girl?

805
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:48,500
No. Security's still
searching the building.

806
00:32:48,542 --> 00:32:50,709
Hey, I heard you made
a pretty slick diagnosis.

807
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,333
What are you talking about?

808
00:32:52,375 --> 00:32:53,542
The epidural abscess

809
00:32:53,583 --> 00:32:55,875
with progressed
neurological symptoms?

810
00:32:55,917 --> 00:32:57,041
James told me,
in a couple hours,

811
00:32:57,083 --> 00:32:58,750
the patient would've never
walk again.

812
00:32:58,792 --> 00:33:01,792
Sounds like
a one-in-a-million catch.

813
00:33:01,834 --> 00:33:04,750
Dr. King,
may I talk to you?

814
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:23,500
It stopped raining.
That's good.

815
00:33:23,542 --> 00:33:24,792
What difference does it make?

816
00:33:24,834 --> 00:33:27,083
Maybe Sarah got scared
by the thunder.

817
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:30,041
You know, she could--
she could be hiding. Right?

818
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:31,083
She could, yeah.

819
00:33:32,417 --> 00:33:33,834
That's--t-that's Sarah's.

820
00:33:33,875 --> 00:33:36,083
I'm sorry, ma'am,
it's--it's evidence.

821
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:37,500
It needs to be processed.

822
00:33:37,542 --> 00:33:38,917
Where did you find it?

823
00:33:38,959 --> 00:33:40,709
It was on a bench out front.

824
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,959
You--
I don't understand.

825
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,500
You found it outside?
W-What about Sarah?

826
00:33:43,542 --> 00:33:47,041
I'm sorry. She's not here.

827
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:50,250
Security's turned the case over
to the police.

828
00:33:50,291 --> 00:33:52,959
As of now,
Sarah is a missing person.

829
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,542
No.

830
00:33:55,583 --> 00:33:56,792
Oh...

831
00:33:58,166 --> 00:33:59,375
Oh!

832
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:03,333
Oh, my god!

833
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:06,000
Oh, my god.

834
00:34:07,166 --> 00:34:10,583
Oh, my god. Where is she?

835
00:34:23,542 --> 00:34:24,750
Hell of a night.

836
00:34:26,542 --> 00:34:28,166
You did good.

837
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:32,208
I think I pissed off
a few people.

838
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,083
The, uh...

839
00:34:34,125 --> 00:34:36,041
Doctor you replaced--

840
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:38,375
he pissed off people, too.

841
00:34:38,417 --> 00:34:39,917
I never held it
against him.

842
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,834
Can't stop thinking
about that kid...

843
00:34:47,875 --> 00:34:49,709
And the parents.

844
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,417
Yeah.

845
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,250
You're what, 12, 13 weeks?

846
00:34:57,875 --> 00:34:59,041
How'd the hell
did you know that?

847
00:34:59,083 --> 00:35:01,792
I'm a really good doctor.

848
00:35:01,834 --> 00:35:03,250
Plus you yakked
on my shoes.

849
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:18,041
I'm not the jealous type.

850
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:20,083
I know women who say that

851
00:35:20,125 --> 00:35:23,041
usually end up torching
their boyfriend's cars,

852
00:35:23,083 --> 00:35:26,041
but, really, I'm not.
I just don't like be played.

853
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:27,542
I'm not playing you.

854
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:29,667
That's--that's not what
I'm doing, Stephanie.

855
00:35:29,709 --> 00:35:31,125
Addison.

856
00:35:31,166 --> 00:35:33,750
You dated her.

857
00:35:33,792 --> 00:35:35,041
I did.

858
00:35:35,083 --> 00:35:36,333
You live next door to her.

859
00:35:36,375 --> 00:35:38,792
I do.

860
00:35:38,834 --> 00:35:42,041
And, uh, apparently
you're trying to get back

861
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:45,250
to being the besties you were
for years.

862
00:35:45,291 --> 00:35:47,500
How did you think that would
make me feel when I found out?

863
00:35:47,542 --> 00:35:49,542
Honestly, I didn't think it
would matter because it's over.

864
00:35:49,583 --> 00:35:52,041
How recently?
Four months.

865
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:54,041
Well, why did it end?

866
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:55,750
Sam?

867
00:35:58,333 --> 00:36:01,041
I proposed
to her, and she turned me down.

868
00:36:01,083 --> 00:36:02,250
Oh, damn.
But wait. Wait, wait, wait.

869
