♪ Ohhh ohhh ohhh ♪

2
00:00:07,125 --> 00:00:10,834
I am 407 days sober.

3
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:13,041
I debated whether or not
I should say the exact number

4
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:14,917
or just rough it,
but I figured,

5
00:00:14,959 --> 00:00:17,583
I've earned every day so...

6
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:20,375
My friend Charlotte
was 8 weeks pregnant

7
00:00:20,417 --> 00:00:22,417
when I celebrated a year.

8
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:23,959
I use her to keep track.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,959
If she were here,
she would probably say,

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,333
"glad somebody's getting
something useful

11
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:28,875
out of this pregnancy."

12
00:00:28,917 --> 00:00:32,875
S-Sounds less awful
if you know her.

13
00:00:32,917 --> 00:00:36,125
I'm doing okay
in my second year.

14
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:38,041
I got
this great new apartment.

15
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:39,625
Been there a couple of months.

16
00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:41,667
I'm really trying
to make it a home.

17
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:44,417
It's been a while
since I've been on my own,

18
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:46,834
but I'm adjusting.

19
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:48,041
Ew.

20
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:50,667
It's nice to have
my own kitchen,

21
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:52,667
be able to cook
whatever I want.

22
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:57,166
And I started
working out again,

23
00:00:57,208 --> 00:01:00,458
which is good,
you know...

24
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,625
And healthy.

25
00:01:02,667 --> 00:01:06,083
Year two is a challenge,

26
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:08,291
but I'm ready.

27
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:09,917
And it's all about growth,

28
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:13,041
and I've set myself up
to grow.

29
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:16,917
I'm good.

30
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:19,250
I'm really good.

31
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:34,959
Holla.

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,667
"Holla"?
Good weekend?

33
00:01:36,709 --> 00:01:39,125
Didn't leave my apartment.
Unpacked.

34
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:41,083
You've been there
three months.

35
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:42,291
I'm methodical.

36
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:43,500
You should be out there,

37
00:01:43,542 --> 00:01:45,083
doing things
that make me feel old.

38
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:47,041
She did greet us
with a holla.

39
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:48,125
Thank you, Coop.

40
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:50,041
Have you met
any of your neighbors?

41
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:52,041
I'm focused on my recovery.

42
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:53,250
Well, socialization

43
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:55,041
is an important part
of your recovery.

44
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:56,125
Have you considered dating?

45
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:58,458
So I can see how quickly
I make dudes my age

46
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,166
sprint
in the other direction?

47
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:01,917
Aw.
Oh, come on.
We're all doctors.

48
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:04,041
We're doctors with friends
who don't scare easily.

49
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:05,291
Mm-hmm.

50
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,041
Would you be open to dating
someone we all vetted?

51
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:08,792
If I say no,
it'll be a thing, right?

52
00:02:08,834 --> 00:02:10,041
Yes.
Oh, yeah. Yes.

53
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:11,083
Fine.

54
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:14,291
Just don't
make me regret it.

55
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,041
It was great, right?

56
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:17,125
Don't answer.

57
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:19,458
I already know.

58
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,291
Did you like your steak?

59
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:22,667
You don't already know?

60
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:25,250
So you liked it?

61
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,917
Almost as much
as you ordering it for me.

62
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:29,750
Was that sarcasm?

63
00:02:29,792 --> 00:02:32,041
You'd tell me
if that was sarcasm, right?

64
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:33,500
Thanks.

65
00:02:33,542 --> 00:02:36,041
Could we split this,
please?

66
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:37,375
Yeah.

67
00:02:37,417 --> 00:02:39,000
You're really interested
in this?

68
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:40,500
You cut
into people's brains.

69
00:02:40,542 --> 00:02:41,709
If that's not interesting,

70
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,500
then what's the hope
for the rest of us?

71
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,917
Something wrong?

72
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,834
Nah.

73
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,041
Are you sure?

74
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,041
Yeah.

75
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,041
She just thinks
when she says "jump,"

76
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:59,959
I should say, "how high?"

77
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,041
She?

78
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:03,041
My ex-wife.

79
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:08,583
You know, it was perfect,

80
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:10,667
and then all of a sudden,
it wasn't.

81
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:12,875
She doesn't think
I deserve an explanation.

82
00:03:12,917 --> 00:03:16,333
But... she still tells me
she loves me when she drinks.

83
00:03:17,917 --> 00:03:19,458
I'm gonna cry.

84
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,834
Ahh.

85
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:30,959
Uh...

86
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,041
Mm.

87
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:39,667
Uh...

88
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:41,667
Should we split the check?
We should split the check,
yeah.

89
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,500
I mean, are--were you guys
also part of the team

90
00:03:44,542 --> 00:03:45,917
that vetted Sarah Palin?

91
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,041
I'm so sorry.

92
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,500
I thought George
was over her.

93
00:03:48,542 --> 00:03:52,375
And I thought Marshall was
a good old-fashioned Texas boy.

94
00:03:52,417 --> 00:03:53,583
What are we
talking about?

95
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,000
Amelia's awful dates.

96
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,083
Oh, you're dating.
Oh, that--that's good.

97
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:58,041
Yeah, no. That's over.

98
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,333
Oh, come on. Bad dates are
kind of a necessary evil.

99
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,041
I dated a poet once.

100
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,667
He was a really,
really bad poet.

101
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:06,041
Turns out the odds of
finding a-a poe or a frost

102
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,709
are like
a million to one.

103
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,500
Dating Edgar Allan poe
would probably be a drag.

104
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,041
I mean, if I had to imagine.

105
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,208
I mean, finding someone
shouldn't feel like a job.

106
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,750
My parents met at a dance.

107
00:04:15,792 --> 00:04:17,458
They both walked in,
saw each other across the room,

108
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,875
that was it.

109
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:20,291
Yeah, but that was
a different time.

110
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,709
Okay, miss "I met my guy
at the grocery."

111
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,083
Oh,
I went out with a guy

112
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:26,125
who said he knew
the best brunch spot in L.A.

113
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,834
Well, he wasn't lying.

114
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:30,291
The rub was, it was
being served by his cult.

115
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,083
Ohh.

116
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,291
I'll do you one better.

117
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:34,500
Imagine you're having
a lovely time,

118
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:35,709
and then
at the end of the night,

119
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,834
your date is engaged
to someone else.

120
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,041
Oh.

121
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,834
I never thanked you
for that dinner.

122
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,041
You're welcome.

123
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,208
Okay, all of this is just
making my couch

124
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,041
seem that much more
appealing.

125
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,500
Who are you gonna meet
on your couch?

126
00:04:46,542 --> 00:04:48,166
Oh, I met Cooper
on my couch.

127
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,375
Or was I in bed?

128
00:04:49,417 --> 00:04:51,041
Uh, you met Cooper
on a sex site.

129
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,041
I mean, it was probably
the bedroom, I would guess.

130
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,041
I'm not trolling the Internet
for dates.

131
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:59,083
I've seen what's out there.
Alone is better.

132
00:05:00,792 --> 00:05:02,750
I guess my agent
can submit me

133
00:05:02,792 --> 00:05:04,458
for bride of Frankenstein
now.

134
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,834
I get that she's a monster.

135
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,250
But I always thought
she was too good for him.

136
00:05:10,417 --> 00:05:12,041
Been in anything
I may have seen?

137
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,166
Hmm. Ever been to
the linden boulevard church

138
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:15,709
in Albuquerque?

139
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,041
Can't say that I have.

140
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,291
I know
I'm starting out here

141
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,709
about ten years too late,

142
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,542
but this is the only thing
I've always wanted.

143
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,917
And I just keep
coming back to it.

144
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,291
After college, I had loans,
and my mom got sick.

145
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,500
I stayed with her
till she passed.

146
00:05:30,542 --> 00:05:33,417
Six months ago,
I decided to get in the car

147
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,208
and just drive.

148
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,583
Doesn't work out,
at least I tried.

149
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:40,166
And I got to smell the ocean
every morning along the way.

150
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,000
Not so bad, right?

151
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,000
You paged me, Dr. Peterson?

152
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:46,208
She refuses
to call me James.

153
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,166
This is kaye,
new onset seizure.

154
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:51,375
I was at an audition--
my first real audition--

155
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:53,917
and the only thing I remember
is hearing my name.

156
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:55,959
I'm not holding my breath
for a callback.

157
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,333
Presented with a classic
tonic-clonic seizure.

158
00:05:58,375 --> 00:05:59,667
I stabilized her with
10 milligrams of lorazepam.

159
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:02,041
Small lac secondary
to the fall.

160
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,250
Ordered tests
on the usual suspects.

161
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:05,875
Any previous history
of seizures?

162
00:06:05,917 --> 00:06:07,333
Recent headaches,

163
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,250
dizziness,
visual changes,

164
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,542
numbness, or weakness?

165
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:11,750
Nothing.

166
00:06:11,792 --> 00:06:14,333
New meds?
Drug or alcohol history?

167
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,542
Damn it.

168
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,458
Another 10 milligrams
of lorazepam.

169
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,875
Protect her airway.

170
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,542
Pulse ox is dropping.

171
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,542
She's not breathing.
We may need to tube her.

172
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,458
Wait.
Just give it a sec.

173
00:06:34,834 --> 00:06:37,083
Let's get a C.T.
see what's up.

174
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,959
Keep me in the loop?

175
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:45,166
Dr. Shepherd.

176
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:46,500
It's Friday.

177
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,083
What do you kids
want for dinner?

178
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,667
French fries! French fries!

179
00:06:52,709 --> 00:06:54,041
They want French fries,

180
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,458
and you don't want
to break the bank.

181
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,166
So why not turn that tired
sack of potatoes

182
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,583
into something your kids
actually want

183
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,625
with the e-z cut
American fry maker?

184
00:07:01,667 --> 00:07:03,625
Adjust the blade settings,
and snap!

185
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:04,834
Traditional cut...

186
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,083
Shoestring...

187
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,917
Even restaurant-quality
steak fries...

188
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,500
Really, really good fries.

189
00:07:10,542 --> 00:07:12,458
You know Billy's
on north canon?

190
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,041
I'm there every Friday night.
Really, really good fries.

191
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,250
When's the last time
you had really,

192
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:19,250
really good
homemade fries?

193
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,500
Really, really good fries
are hard to come by.

194
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:29,333
Really, really good fries.

195
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:30,542
I prefer steak fries,

196
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,333
but I guess these will do.

197
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:40,041
Just be careful
with the ketchup.

198
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,333
"Speed"?

199
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:43,041
Yeah. Every woman I know prefers
"speed" over "die hard."

200
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,792
Of course they do,
because "speed's" about Keanu

201
00:07:45,834 --> 00:07:47,166
doing everything that he can
to protect Sandy.

202
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:49,041
Every girl wants that.

203
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,041
You have
such pretty eyes.

204
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,458
Abandoning
the subtle flirtation thing.

205
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,667
And smart...

206
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:55,917
Stop.
And challenging.

207
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,041
Are you always
this aggressive?

208
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,792
I'm a douchey E.R. doc,
remember?

209
00:07:58,834 --> 00:08:00,667
Does it work?
You're here.

210
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:01,959
That does not answer my--

211
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,041
only you can answer
that question.

212
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,250
Why did you come?

213
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:07,333
I wanted to discuss kaye.

214
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:08,792
Our stable patient
whose test results

215
00:08:08,834 --> 00:08:10,500
won't be complete
until the morning?

216
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:12,542
Why did you come?

217
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,917
What would you say
if I told you

218
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,750
that my TV told me to?

219
00:08:17,792 --> 00:08:19,500
Does that happen often?

220
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:21,291
Mm. First time.

221
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,709
What time is it?

222
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,208
I don't know.

223
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,208
Well, you didn't look
at your watch.

224
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,083
Oh, my god.

225
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,208
It is almost midnight.
I gotta go.

226
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,792
That's why I didn't want you
to know what time it was.

227
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,041
Please express my gratitude
to your television.

228
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,834
Mm. Oh, uh, your jacket.

229
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,625
No. Keep it.

230
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:58,041
That way, you have to
talk to me again.

231
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:01,041
And if you don't, I'll have you
arrested for theft.

232
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:06,291
The valet probably
wants to go, so...

233
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:21,166
Okay.

234
00:09:34,709 --> 00:09:36,667
When a girl lets a guy
buy her dinner,

235
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:39,166
she has certain expectations.

236
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,875
What are you talking about?

237
00:09:40,917 --> 00:09:43,875
"Really, really good fries
are hard to come by."

238
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,041
You were in my head.

239
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,000
You went out with James?

240
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,542
Being alone wasn't terrible.

241
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:50,959
I-I was nesting.

242
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,041
I was making progress
on my apartment...

243
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,041
Sort of.

244
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,834
Now all I can think about

245
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,625
is mixed-message James
not kissing me.

246
00:09:57,667 --> 00:09:59,667
I mean, I am not the girl
who sits around

247
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:00,959
trying to unmix messages.

248
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,041
I mix them.

249
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,333
I think I follow that.

250
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,083
Look, this...

251
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,917
This part of the relationship
happens only once.

252
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,709
There is no relationship.

253
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,709
Okay, what I'm trying
to say is,

254
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,667
let the attraction
percolate.

255
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:14,333
Play hard to get?

256
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,542
I didn't say that.

257
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,000
But it does work.

258
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,041
Yeah.

259
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,166
I'm not doing that.

260
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:23,375
Kaye has no trauma

261
00:10:23,417 --> 00:10:25,291
or family history
of epilepsy.

262
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,917
Tox screen is negative.
Not drugs.

263
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:29,542
Electrolytes?

264
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,709
Normal.

265
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,333
Do you have plans
tonight?

266
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,291
I do.

267
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,917
Well, when you have time,

268
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,291
I'd love to take you to
my favorite Italian place.

269
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,542
Yeah. I'm pretty busy
until next week.

270
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,583
Kaye is new to L.A.?

271
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,500
Uh, Albuquerque, new Mexico.

272
00:10:47,542 --> 00:10:49,500
Hmm. The desert.

273
00:10:49,542 --> 00:10:51,667
Environmental?

274
00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:53,583
Fungus. A-A fungal infection,
maybe?

275
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:56,083
Titers are high
for cocci meningitis.

276
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,625
Okay.

277
00:10:57,667 --> 00:11:00,709
Well, now all we have to do
is find the lesions

278
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,917
and...

279
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:05,041
Found one.

280
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,792
Right here
in the cortical area.

281
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:08,709
I'll schedule a biopsy
for tomorrow.

282
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,291
You're gonna do
brain surgery?

283
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,709
Well, a biopsy will confirm
the diagnosis.

284
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,917
You're gonna cut into her head

285
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:15,041
when we could treat her
with antifungals

286
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,500
and keep a close eye on her?

287
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:20,208
My way is faster
and definitive.

288
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,417
It'll also take her
out of auditions

289
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:23,500
for longer
than she can afford.

290
00:11:23,542 --> 00:11:25,417
All signs point to
a fungal infection,

291
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,583
which, if you don't mind
me saying,

292
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:28,834
was a magnificent catch.

293
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,750
Okay. Don't try
to suck up to me

294
00:11:30,792 --> 00:11:32,333
just so that I'll do
what you want.

295
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,041
I wasn't. It was magnificent.

296
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,250
Uh-huh.

297
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:36,667
But I was hoping
getting my way

298
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:38,041
would be an unintended benefit
of stating the truth.

299
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,500
We can schedule
a follow-up C.T. in a month.

300
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:46,458
She stays
on the anticonvulsants,

301
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,375
and we schedule a follow-up
in a week.

302
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:53,000
Are you really busy tonight
or are you playing hard to get?

303
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:56,834
Well, I... Have
a lot on my plate right now.

304
00:11:56,875 --> 00:12:01,333
If next week is the soonest
I can see you, okay, but...

305
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:05,041
I was really hoping to spend
some time with you before then.

306
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:08,000
How did you score a table
overlooking the kitchen?

307
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,083
I took care
of the chef's daughter

308
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,291
a few months ago.

309
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,208
High fever, vomiting.

310
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,709
My intern diagnosed the flu,
was about to send her home,

311
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,041
but I had a feeling.

312
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,875
We did a spinal tap--

313
00:12:19,917 --> 00:12:21,250
bacterial meningitis.

314
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:24,458
I saved her.

315
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,792
Well... this is me.

316
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:36,500
Thank you for dinner.
That was really lovely.

317
00:12:36,542 --> 00:12:38,917
I had a wonderful time.

318
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,000
Me, too.

319
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,250
Get home safely.

320
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,083
Yeah.

321
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:53,583
Okay.

322
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,041
But it doesn't make sense.

323
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,041
I'm hot.
I would kiss me.

324
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:00,375
Wouldn't you kiss me?

325
00:13:00,417 --> 00:13:01,875
Absolutely.
I would, yes.

326
00:13:01,917 --> 00:13:04,041
I didn't ask for this.
He pursued me.

327
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,458
Would not let it go.

328
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,250
Finally I gave in,
this is what I get.

329
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,458
You can't let it
upset you.

330
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,792
I'm not upset. I'm pissed.

331
00:13:10,834 --> 00:13:12,875
Maybe he's just
not that into you.

332
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,125
I've always wanted
to say that.

333
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:17,041
Maybe now is not the right time,
Addison.

334
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,500
I got waxed.
Like "waxed" waxed.

335
00:13:19,542 --> 00:13:21,083
I spent a small fortune
on new underwear and heels,

336
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,709
both of which are
supremely uncomfortable,

337
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,041
and for what?

338
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,792
Oh, the things we do.
Women.

339
00:13:27,834 --> 00:13:30,041
I mean, why, when we could be
on our couch in sweats,

340
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,875
vegging out to a marathon
of "bitch snapped"?

341
00:13:32,917 --> 00:13:34,083
Because you like him.

342
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,041
I want to do something
that justifies

343
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,083
the pain I'm inflicting
upon myself.

344
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,458
Do you think he's--

345
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,667
he's not gay.

346
00:13:39,709 --> 00:13:40,792
Maybe he got over
a really bad break-up

347
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:42,375
and he wants to go slowly.
Mm.

348
00:13:42,417 --> 00:13:44,041
Is that really a thing,
going slowly?

349
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,375
I mean, doesn't that
only happen in the movies?

350
00:13:45,417 --> 00:13:47,041
I'm done. I'm j--I'm done.

351
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,625
No, you cannot quit.

352
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:50,625
And you can't put
all your eggs in one basket.

353
00:13:50,667 --> 00:13:52,041
The quest to find somebody

354
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,208
to spend your life with
is not easy.

355
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,041
You need time and fortitude.

356
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,417
Do you hear yourself?

357
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:59,125
I-I was just looking to get
out of my apartment.

358
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:01,041
Okay. Well...

359
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,583
Then staying in that vein,
humor me a little longer.

360
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:03,917
Are you free tonight?

361
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:05,291
No, really.

362
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,041
I mean, you could stay home...

363
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:09,083
And wonder why
James isn't kissing you...

364
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,709
Or...

365
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,041
Ah.

366
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:13,500
Ortho surgeon.

367
00:14:13,542 --> 00:14:15,959
Totally single.
Great conversationalist.

368
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:17,792
Mm.
Definitely not a sociopath.

369
00:14:17,834 --> 00:14:20,375
Want me to see
if he's free tonight?

370
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,083
Well, you're already waxed.

371
00:14:27,417 --> 00:14:29,375
Mm. Okay.

372
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,250
James.

373
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:34,625
You look beautiful.
Date?

374
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:37,125
Yeah. I, uh, actually
was on my way out.

375
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,458
Cool.

376
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,125
I can't stay but a minute.
Middle of my shift.

377
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,667
It's just...

378
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:46,709
The anticipation
was killing me.

379
00:15:12,917 --> 00:15:15,000
Enjoy your date.

380
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,834
Gone?

381
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,417
Like--like completely gone?

382
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,041
There's no trace
of the lesion.

383
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,125
The antifungals
were effective.

384
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,959
So no more falling
on my face at auditions

385
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,333
in the literal sense?

386
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:36,542
There is no reason to suspect

387
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:37,959
that you'll have
another seizure.

388
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,125
I'd already called my dad

389
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,041
and told him that I
might have to come home.

390
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:44,208
Thank you.

391
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,041
Both of you.

392
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,458
Oh, if I leave now,

393
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,542
I can still make it
to my class across town.

394
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,333
Thanks.

395
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,041
Did you ever have
that much energy?

396
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:58,166
Yep.

397
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,500
I know I should wait
until tonight,

398
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:00,959
but now that
the patient's gone...

399
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You can totally kiss me.

400
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:09,041
Condoms--

401
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,291
ribbed, glow-in-the-dark,
tingling?

402
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:14,041
Which is usually the sensation
that sends you to the doctor.

403
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,500
Slow down. Back it up.

404
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:17,083
I'm seeing someone.

405
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,291
James.

406
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,500
You know?
Of course you know.

407
00:16:19,542 --> 00:16:20,709
Doesn't matter.

408
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,083
What matters is,
I went to buy condoms today,

409
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,458
and there are, like,
a billion choices,

410
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,000
and I don't want to insult him
by not buying magnums

411
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,375
or buying them
and making him think

412
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:30,375
that my previous boyfriends
are the Lakers.

413
00:16:30,417 --> 00:16:32,083
Well, since when
are you shy about sex?

414
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,583
I--I'm not. I just
don't want to offend James.

415
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,041
Ah, that's crap.
I think this is about you

416
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,125
gettin' back in the saddle
after a year.

417
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:40,041
I don't know. Maybe.

418
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,917
You doin'
what you need to do?

419
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,417
I'm here talking to you.

420
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:44,917
That's not what I mean.

421
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,083
I am getting to meetings.

422
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,083
You know why I'm asking.
I know why you're asking.

423
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,500
When you meet someone new,

424
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:51,500
sometimes sobriety
takes a backseat.

425
00:16:51,542 --> 00:16:53,041
You start cutting corners,
and then...

426
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,834
You slip. I get it.

427
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,291
Last time you had sex,
you woke up to--

428
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:58,750
a dead Ryan.

429
00:16:58,792 --> 00:17:01,709
Yes... I remember.

430
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,125
But it's not gonna be
a thing.

431
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:05,250
You sure?

432
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:08,125
I'm sure. I'm ready.

433
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,083
I just need that push.

434
00:17:13,917 --> 00:17:17,000
Oh.

435
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,000
Ahh.

436
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,041
Ribbed,

437
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,667
glow-in the dark,
tingling.

438
00:17:29,709 --> 00:17:31,875
They call this one
"the soldier."

439
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:33,041
Huh.

440
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,250
Trial and error.

441
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,291
Find out what works
for you,

442
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:37,583
and have fun doing it.

443
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:42,750
Oh. Just in case.

444
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:52,041
Hey.

445
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,291
Wow.

446
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,208
Yeah?

447
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,041
Please.

448
00:18:25,792 --> 00:18:27,083
Hey.

449
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,750
Wow.

450
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,709
Do you have a condom?

451
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,792
I didn't want to be
presumptuous.

452
00:18:43,834 --> 00:18:45,041
I have some.

453
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,792
I think.

454
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:55,041
You are so gorgeous.

455
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:01,208
You are so gorgeous.

456
00:19:20,542 --> 00:19:22,041
What's wrong?

457
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,208
Sorry. Uh...

458
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,000
Can you not touch me?

459
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:32,208
Are you--

460
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,000
You're here.

461
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,834
Yeah.

462
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,041
I got this thing

463
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,041
where I can't let a date
end in tears, so...

464
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,875
I was gonna
make you breakfast, but...

465
00:20:02,917 --> 00:20:06,959
You only have
salsa, ice cream, and bread.

466
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,875
Bon appetit.

467
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:15,041
I owe you an explanation.

468
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,500
You don't.

469
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:22,458
I like you.

470
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,917
And last night,
I wanted to.

471
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,709
I mean,
I've got enough condoms

472
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,166
to supply a frat house.

473
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:34,125
I thought I was ready.

474
00:20:35,709 --> 00:20:39,500
But then when you started
taking off my dress...

475
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:46,458
I haven't had sex with someone
who mattered in a long time.

476
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,500
And now I'm sober,

477
00:20:49,542 --> 00:20:51,041
and I'm in a good place,

478
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,709
but in some ways
I'm still a mess.

479
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:58,041
So...

480
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,208
I'm giving you an out.

481
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:23,041
What do you want
on your toast,

482
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,041
salsa or ice cream?

483
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:29,208
What are you lookin' at?

484
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,041
You.

485
00:22:32,834 --> 00:22:34,959
No, what are you
looking at?

486
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,834
I have a freckle.

487
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:40,041
What about it?

488
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:43,041
It looks like Indiana.

489
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:45,625
Can I kiss it?

490
00:22:45,667 --> 00:22:48,792
Mm. You're going to anyway.

491
00:22:56,667 --> 00:23:01,333
I see a few more down here
that require my attention.

492
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:05,417
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

493
00:23:13,917 --> 00:23:16,083
What are you thinking about?

494
00:23:17,834 --> 00:23:20,041
I don't know.

495
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:22,333
Don't know or won't say?

496
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:28,083
I'm not
thinking about anything.

497
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:33,000
And that's good.

498
00:23:50,667 --> 00:23:53,000
Why don't you drink?

499
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:57,083
You don't really--

500
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:58,291
I do.

501
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:00,458
Really.

502
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:06,250
I'm an alcoholic.

503
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:09,959
And I used to do oxy.

504
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,041
I fell in love,

505
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:15,709
I thought, with an addict.

506
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:18,041
Mm.

507
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:22,333
I don't know why I said
"I thought."

508
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:24,375
I mean...

509
00:24:24,417 --> 00:24:27,375
I do.

510
00:24:27,417 --> 00:24:30,458
It's because
I'm not sure anymore

511
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,959
if I was actually
in love with him, but...

512
00:24:34,166 --> 00:24:36,041
To say that I wasn't
feels cold

513
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:38,166
because...

514
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:40,417
He's gone.

515
00:24:43,417 --> 00:24:45,375
I woke up
from this amazing high

516
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,000
to find him dead.

517
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:52,041
And it didn't feel fair

518
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:54,000
when I found out
I was pregnant.

519
00:24:56,458 --> 00:24:59,709
This baby...

520
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,375
Our baby
helped me stay clean.

521
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:05,083
Maybe it would've
gotten him clean

522
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:07,000
and we could've...

523
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,041
I don't know about
being in love with him

524
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:20,041
because that time
in my life...

525
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:22,000
The drugs...

526
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,375
I lived it, but...

527
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:32,208
It doesn't feel like
my life.

528
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:35,041
You loved him.

529
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:39,041
We were sober together
for, like, five minutes.

530
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:41,834
If it felt like love,
then it was.

531
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:44,041
Don't let the perspective
you have now

532
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:46,166
diminish the feelings
you had then.

533
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:48,667
That wouldn't be fair.

534
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:55,041
Have you ever
been in love?

535
00:25:55,083 --> 00:25:58,041
Couple times.

536
00:25:58,083 --> 00:26:00,041
Not counting Halle Berry.

537
00:26:02,542 --> 00:26:04,834
What happened?

538
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:06,000
With Halle?

539
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:07,041
Mm-hmm.

540
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:08,166
I knew
I wanted to see

541
00:26:08,208 --> 00:26:10,041
more than
dickson county, Tennessee.

542
00:26:12,542 --> 00:26:14,709
I'd like to see it.

543
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,667
When you got an hour,
I'll show you.

544
00:26:30,375 --> 00:26:34,041
Something just doesn't
sit right.

545
00:26:34,083 --> 00:26:36,834
It doesn't bother you that
there was only one lesion?

546
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:38,041
Kaye?

547
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:39,041
Yeah.

548
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:40,458
It would bother me
if she were presenting

549
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,875
with more lesions
or more seizures,

550
00:26:41,917 --> 00:26:43,750
but she's not.

551
00:26:45,709 --> 00:26:46,875
I don't know.

552
00:26:46,917 --> 00:26:49,458
Her titers were high,
but not incredibly.

553
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,750
Amelia, you did great
for kaye.

554
00:26:57,083 --> 00:27:00,041
She's halfway to an Oscar
as we speak.

555
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:02,417
Take the victory.

556
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:03,667
Mm.

557
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:07,875
This is
a public service announcement

558
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,875
from the American soci--

559
00:27:09,917 --> 00:27:11,250
Throws it out of bounds,
and that's gonna--

560
00:27:11,291 --> 00:27:13,041
With happy dog
dog chow--

561
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:14,709
Listen,
the conservatives can say...

562
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:17,041
Not this windbag again,
please.

563
00:27:17,083 --> 00:27:19,500
How do you keep up with
what's going on in the world?

564
00:27:19,542 --> 00:27:21,083
I read the paper.

565
00:27:21,125 --> 00:27:23,667
Mm. Smarty-pants
probably has a subscription

566
00:27:23,709 --> 00:27:25,041
to the "times."

567
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:26,291
The "journal."

568
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:29,041
I prefer objectivity
in my news.

569
00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:30,375
You're calling out

570
00:27:30,417 --> 00:27:32,333
one of the most esteemed
news publications in the world

571
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:34,000
for a lack of objectivity?

572
00:27:34,041 --> 00:27:35,166
How can it be objective

573
00:27:35,208 --> 00:27:37,959
if all of its reporters
are progressives?

574
00:27:40,375 --> 00:27:42,583
Who did you vote for?

575
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:45,417
In the last presidential...

576
00:27:45,458 --> 00:27:47,417
Who did you vote for?

577
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:48,834
It's called a secret ballot,

578
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,709
and it's the foundation
of our democracy.

579
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,041
You're a republican.

580
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:53,625
Because I wouldn't tell you
who I voted for?

581
00:27:53,667 --> 00:27:55,208
Because you ended
a sentence with

582
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:56,959
"foundation of our democracy."

583
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,291
I'm a conservative.

584
00:27:58,333 --> 00:27:59,834
Just say you're a republican.
No.

585
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:01,375
Why?
Because you really,
really want me to.

586
00:28:01,417 --> 00:28:02,834
I'm in bed with a republican.

587
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:04,041
I'm pretty sure
it's not the first time.

588
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:06,041
Just think back to
the best sex you've ever had.

589
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:07,542
Not funny.

590
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:08,625
Deal breaker?
Abortion?

591
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:10,750
Pro-life.
The death penalty?

592
00:28:10,792 --> 00:28:12,625
This is the sexiest
pillow talk ever.

593
00:28:12,667 --> 00:28:14,834
Don't try to avoid it.

594
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:16,041
The Bible says
"an eye for an eye."

595
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:17,458
Ohh!

596
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,041
All right, that logic
drives me crazy!

597
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:21,417
You just said
that your for life,

598
00:28:21,458 --> 00:28:22,625
but you're for
the death penalty?

599
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:24,834
I am for life--
innocent life.

600
00:28:24,875 --> 00:28:27,041
Whose job is it to judge
innocence and guilt?

601
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:29,041
Does the person who took
Sarah Nelson deserve to live?

602
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:30,417
Doesn't the Bible also say
something about

603
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:32,000
turn the other cheek

604
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:33,542
and god's the only one who can
judge and stuff like that?

605
00:28:33,583 --> 00:28:34,750
Wouldn't have pegged you

606
00:28:34,792 --> 00:28:35,959
as someone who would
quote scripture.

607
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,041
I did not quote scripture.
I paraphrased.

608
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:38,417
And everybody knows
that stuff.

609
00:28:38,458 --> 00:28:39,667

Hey. Your parents
get in all right?

655
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,166
At the hotel now.

656
00:30:47,208 --> 00:30:49,583
I just wanted to check in
with you about tonight.

657
00:30:49,625 --> 00:30:52,000
5:00 because they're
on east coast time.

658
00:30:52,041 --> 00:30:53,417
That chain restaurant
in the mall

659
00:30:53,458 --> 00:30:55,166
because they're allergic
to new experiences.

660
00:30:55,208 --> 00:30:57,667
I mean, you're sure
this is something

661
00:30:57,709 --> 00:30:59,041
you're ready to do?

662
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:01,291
I... it's not like they'll
never be in L.A. again.

663
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:02,625
Look, if you've
changed your mind

664
00:31:02,667 --> 00:31:04,041
and you don't want me
to meet them--

665
00:31:04,083 --> 00:31:05,750
no, no, no,
it's not that. It's--

666
00:31:05,792 --> 00:31:07,583
what is it?

667
00:31:07,625 --> 00:31:08,792
I dreamt last night

668
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:10,375
that the ceiling
in the restaurant collapsed.

669
00:31:10,417 --> 00:31:11,792
Everyone was all right,

670
00:31:11,834 --> 00:31:13,041
but... I don't know.

671
00:31:13,083 --> 00:31:15,000
Meeting the folks
is a big deal.

672
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:17,041
Is this you freaking out?

673
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,417
No.

674
00:31:18,458 --> 00:31:20,000
Yeah.

675
00:31:20,041 --> 00:31:21,041
Sort of.
I think it is.

676
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:22,834
I'm your girlfriend,

677
00:31:22,875 --> 00:31:26,375
and I am totally excited
to meet your parents.

678
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:33,583
I wanted them
to experience L.A.

679
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,583
He took us
to one of those restaurants

680
00:31:35,625 --> 00:31:37,583
where they don't cook
the food.

681
00:31:37,625 --> 00:31:39,041
For my money,

682
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:41,625
you can't beat a restaurant
with an unlimited salad bar.

683
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:43,041
Well, I wish
they would put a limit

684
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:44,208
on these cheese biscuits.

685
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:46,083
I am not gonna fit
into my scrubs tomorrow.

686
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:48,208
That's a good one,
Amelia.

687
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:50,667
You know,
I was not expecting

688
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:52,041
to like you as much as I do.

689
00:31:52,083 --> 00:31:54,166
Mom.
No, I didn't mean it
like that.

690
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:56,041
I just always envisioned
that you would

691
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:58,000
settle down
somewhere near us

692
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:01,667
and marry a local gal.

693
00:32:01,709 --> 00:32:03,917
Oh, let's, uh,

694
00:32:03,959 --> 00:32:05,959
let's toast to new friends.

695
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,041
New friends.
Hear, hear.

696
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:08,125
New friends.

697
00:32:08,166 --> 00:32:09,750
So, Amelia, do you have
any siblings?

698
00:32:09,792 --> 00:32:11,458
Three sisters, one brother.

699
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,959
All doctors.

700
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,458
Oh. Did your mother work?

701
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,208
Yeah, she was a nurse
in the Navy for 25 years.

702
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,250
Huh.
That's probably where y'all
got the idea to be doctors.

703
00:32:19,291 --> 00:32:20,458
Mm.

704
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,875
I teach English.

705
00:32:21,917 --> 00:32:24,834
No idea where he got
an aptitude for science.

706
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:26,041
But I couldn't be prouder.

707
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:28,917
Ah, I just direct traffic
in the E.R.

708
00:32:28,959 --> 00:32:30,041
Amelia's the genius
at the table.

709
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:31,125
He's being modest.

710
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:32,542
The night we met,
he caught something I missed,

711
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:33,875
saved a man's life.

712
00:32:33,917 --> 00:32:35,041
Well, I'm not
the least bit surprised,

713
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:37,250
but then I might be
a teeny bit biased.

714
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:41,000
It is cool seeing the three
of you together as a family.

715
00:32:41,041 --> 00:32:42,750
You guys...
Get along really well.

716
00:32:42,792 --> 00:32:44,000
It's nice.

717
00:32:44,041 --> 00:32:46,041
Well, that is so sweet
of you to say, hon.

718
00:32:46,083 --> 00:32:47,583
You know, I think
it might have to do

719
00:32:47,625 --> 00:32:49,041
with the fact
that I was able

720
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:51,041
to be at home
when he was growing up.

721
00:32:51,083 --> 00:32:53,125
What kind of surgery
do you practice?

722
00:32:53,166 --> 00:32:54,333
I'm a neurosurgeon.
Oh.

723
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:55,750
Amelia.

724
00:32:55,792 --> 00:32:58,041
Your job sounds as hard
as... rocket science.

725
00:32:59,208 --> 00:33:01,750
Is that something you could
ever do part-time?

726
00:33:01,792 --> 00:33:03,041
Mom,
we talked about this.

727
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:04,959
Why would I do
the thing I love part-time?

728
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,750
Well, I was thinking, if you
ever want to have children...

729
00:33:07,792 --> 00:33:08,959
I won't quit working.

730
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,500
Amelia,
you don't have to answer.

731
00:33:10,542 --> 00:33:12,000
Mom, now is not the time.

732
00:33:12,041 --> 00:33:14,125
I am just making
polite conversation.

733
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:15,333
It's okay.
I can answer.

734
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:16,959
She promised
not to interrogate you.

735
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,375
Well, it's not
an interrogation.
You see?

736
00:33:19,417 --> 00:33:22,000
I just want to make sure
that you're taken care of.

737
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,375
Mom, not the place,
not the time,

738
00:33:24,417 --> 00:33:26,000
not your business.

739
00:33:26,041 --> 00:33:27,333
Let's move on.

740
00:33:28,792 --> 00:33:31,041
Well, I'm gonna have
the chicken parmesan.

741
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:32,125
Ooh, that does sound good.

742
00:33:32,166 --> 00:33:33,333
It's always good.

743
00:33:33,375 --> 00:33:35,583
How about I get
the francaise, this one?

744
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:37,208
It has that mushrooms
and zucchini.

745
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:39,041
I like zucchini.

746
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:40,959
I'd say it went
pretty well.

747
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,917
You mean once I kept
my mouth shut.

748
00:33:42,959 --> 00:33:44,875
Well, she promised to play nice,
but you know how mothers are.

749
00:33:44,917 --> 00:33:46,792
I wasn't talking about her.
I was talking about you.

750
00:33:46,834 --> 00:33:48,166
You cut me off.

751
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:49,583
I stopped her from asking you

752
00:33:49,625 --> 00:33:51,041
about things
we haven't discussed yet.

753
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:52,208
It was like you didn't think

754
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:53,875
that I had ideas
about my own life.

755
00:33:53,917 --> 00:33:55,583
Or you didn't trust me
to talk to your mother.

756
00:33:55,625 --> 00:33:57,041
I'm sorry if that's
the way it came across.

757
00:33:57,083 --> 00:33:58,375
It's just my mother
I don't trust.

758
00:33:58,417 --> 00:34:00,709
You know what? I will not
be treated like a little child

759
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:02,458
who needs to be silenced,
all right?

760
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,250
This is not working.

761
00:34:04,291 --> 00:34:06,834
What are you talking about?

762
00:34:06,875 --> 00:34:08,208
Wait. Are you breaking up
with me?

763
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:10,000
You need to go.

764
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:12,000
I'm not going anywhere. We're
just having an argument here.

765
00:34:12,041 --> 00:34:13,041
Go.

766
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:14,166
No.

767
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:15,709
Fine.

768
00:34:17,625 --> 00:34:18,834
Amelia.

769
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:34,041
Are you awake?

770
00:34:34,083 --> 00:34:36,458
I'm awake.

771
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,041
I might be hallucinating,
but I'm awake.

772
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:40,417
I don't want to bother you.

773
00:34:40,458 --> 00:34:41,875
I've been laying here
for weeks.

774
00:34:41,917 --> 00:34:44,041
Everything's a bother.

775
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:45,667
You look like
death warmed over.

776
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:47,583
Thanks, Heidi Klum.

777
00:34:47,625 --> 00:34:49,000
Mm. I got a headache

778
00:34:49,041 --> 00:34:51,000
that would put Godzilla
in a fetal position.

779
00:34:51,041 --> 00:34:53,959
I don't know if it's noon
or a quarter to midnight

780
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,458
or, well, 1976.

781
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,083
It's 2:00 A.M.

782
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:00,417
What the hell
are you doing here?

783
00:35:00,458 --> 00:35:02,041
I couldn't fall asleep
in the on-call room.

784
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:03,083
You on call?

785
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:04,875
No. I...

786
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:08,417
James and I had a fight.

787
00:35:08,458 --> 00:35:10,417
He's still at my apartment,

788
00:35:10,458 --> 00:35:12,041
which, in an act
of sheer freakin' brilliance,

789
00:35:12,083 --> 00:35:13,291
I stormed out of.

790
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,041
Who storms out
of their own apartment?

791
00:35:16,083 --> 00:35:18,083
Ugh. I'm so embarrassed.

792
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:21,041
I mean, I-I was just trying
to stand up for myself,

793
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:22,417
and now...

794
00:35:22,458 --> 00:35:24,417
Oh, god.
I'm so humiliated.

795
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:26,166
I can't go back.

796
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:29,000
I just--i wanted...

797
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,542
I just need to sit
with someone.

798
00:35:32,583 --> 00:35:35,041
Sit.

799
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:06,166
Hey.
Hey.

800
00:36:06,208 --> 00:36:07,375
Late night with James?

801
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:09,041
Mm. Something like that.

802
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:11,000
So it's going well?

803
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:13,000
Things are fine.

804
00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:14,166
Why do I get the feeling

805
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,792
there's something
you're not telling me?

806
00:36:15,834 --> 00:36:18,041
Why don't you get the feeling
that I don't want to talk?

807
00:36:18,083 --> 00:36:20,125
I don't need a shrink.

808
00:36:20,166 --> 00:36:22,291
I didn't need
a matchmaker either,

809
00:36:22,333 --> 00:36:25,125
but that did not stop you
from shoving dates in my face

810
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:27,000
in some quest for true love

811
00:36:27,041 --> 00:36:30,041
that I did not even remotely
hint at being interested in.

812
00:36:32,417 --> 00:36:34,417
Just let it go.

813
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:37,542
Sorry.

814
00:36:38,792 --> 00:36:40,041
Oh.

815
00:36:40,083 --> 00:36:42,583
No. Uh...

816
00:36:42,625 --> 00:36:45,041
I'm sorry.

817
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:46,542
I didn't get
much sleep last night.

818
00:36:46,583 --> 00:36:48,166
No, you're right.

819
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:49,625
You are right.

820
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:52,041
I've been spending a lot of time
on my couch alone, too.

821
00:36:53,291 --> 00:36:55,000
And the thing is...

822
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:59,250
I'm not a young woman.

823
00:36:59,291 --> 00:37:03,041
I mean, I know,
I still got it, but...

824
00:37:03,083 --> 00:37:05,458
I'm not young.

825
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,041
So sometimes I think

826
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:10,041
maybe...

827
00:37:10,083 --> 00:37:14,041
I will spend
the rest of my life alone.

828
00:37:19,333 --> 00:37:22,208
I have to go the hospital.

829
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:30,875
Violet, you can call me.

830
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:35,333
We can hang out in the couch
in sweats together.

831
00:37:43,792 --> 00:37:45,500
I got the page.

832
00:37:45,542 --> 00:37:46,709
What happened?

833
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:48,041
Another seizure.

834
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:50,041
I know. I'm taking her for
a C.T. to see what happened.

835
00:37:50,083 --> 00:37:51,959
I thought you said
the lesions were gone.

836
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,041
They were.

837
00:37:53,083 --> 00:37:55,083
We'll figure this out,
kaye. We will.

838
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:57,500
Please. I can't...
What's wrong with me?

839
00:37:57,542 --> 00:37:59,041
I'll take it from here.

840
00:37:59,083 --> 00:38:01,834
Glad you're okay.
I was worried.

841
00:38:12,041 --> 00:38:14,000
You okay?

842
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:17,583
Do I deserve someone?

843
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:18,792
Amelia, of course.

844
00:38:18,834 --> 00:38:20,333
I mean, why--
why do you--

845
00:38:20,375 --> 00:38:23,500
because I don't know
if James and I can't work

846
00:38:23,542 --> 00:38:26,375
or if don't want us to.

847
00:38:26,417 --> 00:38:29,083
I mean, at the end of the day,
I'm a recovering addict

848
00:38:29,125 --> 00:38:31,041
with a dump truck
full of baggage, right?

849
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:33,458
And the worst tragedy
that has ever struck James

850
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,750
is having to put down
his golden retriever.

851
00:38:35,792 --> 00:38:37,333
You're not giving him
any credit.

852
00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:39,291
He's an E.R. doctor, right?
He's--he's seen things.

853
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:42,083
Sure.
Other people's tragedies.

854
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:43,709
That does not
prepare someone

855
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:46,417
to live with crazy
day in and day out.

856
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:50,208
He's a republican.

857
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:56,834
Do you even vote?

858
00:38:56,875 --> 00:38:58,041
That is not the point.

859
00:38:58,083 --> 00:38:59,583
I don't think
you're seeing the point.

860
00:38:59,625 --> 00:39:02,250
You've been so strong
this past year.

861
00:39:02,291 --> 00:39:03,792
And there's no doubt
in my mind

862
00:39:03,834 --> 00:39:05,166
that if you wanted to
work through this, you could.

863
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:07,000
But what you're not seeing,

864
00:39:07,041 --> 00:39:11,000
and what I didn't really see
until recently is,

865
00:39:11,041 --> 00:39:13,041
none of it matters.

866
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:15,583
The petty things
that we argue about

867
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:18,000
and wish we could change
about the other person, it...

868
00:39:19,875 --> 00:39:22,792
You want to know
the only thing that matters?

869
00:39:22,834 --> 00:39:26,041
If someone will hold your hand
when you have cancer.

870
00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:28,041
Sheldon--

871
00:39:28,083 --> 00:39:29,583
it's prostate,
and I'm fine.

872
00:39:29,625 --> 00:39:33,875
Well... I hope
I'm gonna be fine.

873
00:39:33,917 --> 00:39:36,041
But I...
I've never been happier

874
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:39,792
because I've found someone
who'll hold my hand.

875
00:39:39,834 --> 00:39:42,458
And trust me,
that is...

876
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,750

Kaye.

the--the titers that--
that aren't that high--

900
00:40:47,959 --> 00:40:51,125
it's her heart.
There's something in her heart.

901
00:40:51,166 --> 00:40:53,959
She could be throwing emboli
that are causing her to seize.

Echo confirmed

a tumor in the left atrium
of her heart.

905
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:00,583
What does that mean?

906
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,583
As the tumor broke apart,
you threw emboli,

907
00:41:02,625 --> 00:41:03,709
and one went to your brain.

908
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:04,917
That's what caused
the lesion.

909
00:41:04,959 --> 00:41:06,166
And subsequently,
the seizures.

910
00:41:06,208 --> 00:41:08,000
Lifesaving catch,
Dr. Shepherd.

911
00:41:08,041 --> 00:41:09,041
You're in good hands.

Dr. Bennett's gonna
get the tumor.
