And since he's not returning
any of your calls

00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,041
or showing up
for his appointments,

91
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,458
clearly he doesn't.

92
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,709
But that's my fault.
I need to win back his trust.

93
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,041
Look, you thought he took

00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,083
What are they?

107
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,667
Well, if I choose
door number one,

radical prostatectomy.

109
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,583
It comes complete
with the possibility

110
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,500
of incontinence
and impotence.

111
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:11,709
Door number two
is active surveillance,

112
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,083
where we watch and wait

113
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,750
while the cancer cells that
are already in my prostate

114
00:05:15,792 --> 00:05:17,667
perhaps take up
residence elsewhere,

115
00:05:17,709 --> 00:05:19,583
maybe my lungs or my liver.

116
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,542
And then
there's door number three--

117
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:25,208
toxic levels of radiation
beamed into my manhood

127

129
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:48,000
You've made up your mind

130

not to make up your mind
about cancer.

131
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,709

you'd like to not talk about

133
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,667

00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:44,041
And when you didn't call,
I was afraid--

181
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,500
what,
I took a little girl?

182
00:08:47,834 --> 00:08:49,875
When you first came to see me,
you were suicidal.

183
00:08:49,917 --> 00:08:52,834
Yes, and you helped me
through that, and I'm grateful.

184
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:55,458
But after that night
at the E.R.--

185
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,667
that was a mistake.

186
00:08:56,709 --> 00:08:58,750
I rushed to judgment,
and that was wrong.

187
00:08:58,792 --> 00:09:00,041
I didn't take
that little girl.

188
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,667
I know. I know.

189
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:04,291
And... I want to continue
to help you.

190
00:09:08,792 --> 00:09:11,750
Actually, um...

191
00:09:11,792 --> 00:09:13,458
I'm doing pretty well.

192
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,625
Good. Good.
What's been going on?

193
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:17,250
I got a promotion at work.

194
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,208
Been finishing some projects
around the house.

195
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,083
And the, uh, the urges?

196
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,375
I'm managing them.

197
00:09:22,417 --> 00:09:25,625
I'm working the checklist,
avoiding triggers.

198
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:27,667
And i'm--I'm keeping busy
with a new friend.

199
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:29,083
Well, that sounds like
a positive step.

200
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:30,875
Yeah.
Did you meet him at work?

201
00:09:30,917 --> 00:09:32,166
It's her, actually.

202
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,875
Oh.

203
00:09:33,917 --> 00:09:35,417
What's her name?

204
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:38,041
Alyssa.

205
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,834
Is--is she a colleague?

206
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,625
No. No,
she's just a friend,

207
00:09:41,667 --> 00:09:44,709
but she's... she's great.

208
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,250
We're into a lot
of the same music

209
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:49,667
and TV shows,
and she understands me,

210
00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:52,750
you know? And--and she's kind
and so pretty.

211
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:56,041
And... I don't know.
I've n--

212
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:59,041
I've never felt
this way before.

213
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:03,542
It's just nice to connect
with somebody, you know?

214
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:06,041
So it's romantic, then?

215
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,625
I want it to be.

216
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:12,417
I get the feeling
she does, too.

217
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:16,709
Nick, I have to ask you...

218
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,750
How old is she?

219
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:28,291
He said she was 25,
but... he hesitated.

220
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:29,542
That doesn't mean
he was lying.

221
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,166
No, no. His demeanor.
He was excited.

222
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,583
Almost euphoric.

223
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:33,583
Euphoria isn't uncommon

224
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,250
when the s.S.R.I.S
start to work

225
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:36,500
and the depression lifts.

226
00:10:36,542 --> 00:10:38,375
He was acting
like a schoolboy in love.

227
00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:40,291
So you're afraid he's in love
with a little girl?

228
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,458
I'm afraid he's in love
with Sarah Nelson.

229
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,333
Wow. That's quite a leap.

230
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:45,542
Aw, come on, Diane.

231
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,333
You saw him in the E.R.
after she disappeared.

232
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,083
How could he
have taken her?
I don't know,

233
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,166
but I do not believe
that he would be this excited

234
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,375
about having a relationship
with an age-appropriate woman.

235
00:10:53,417 --> 00:10:56,375
You're an excellent therapist,
but there are some things

236
00:10:56,417 --> 00:10:58,291
that make even the psychiatric
community uncomfortable.

237
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,041
Oh, this has
nothing to do

238
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,208
with finding pedophilia
to be repugnant or--

239
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,583
okay, then maybe
it's cognitive dissonance.

240
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:05,834
What?

241
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,083
You effectively accused him
of taking Sarah,

242
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,166
and you were wrong.

243
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,375
Obviously, the guilt you feel

244
00:11:10,417 --> 00:11:13,166
over destroying
the trust with a patient--

245
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,041
it's overwhelming.
Wait.

246
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,959
You're saying that I concocted
this scenario where he took her

247
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,375
to assuage my guilt about
accusing him in the first place?

248
00:11:21,417 --> 00:11:23,375
I don't know. Did you?

249
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:25,500
I wouldn't do that.

250
00:11:25,542 --> 00:11:27,375
Sheldon, your patient
was suicidal

251
00:11:27,417 --> 00:11:29,208
and just came back
into therapy.

252
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,959
Your willingness to accuse him
without any evidence--

253
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,041
it worries me.

254
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,208
A little girl's life
is at stake.

255
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:38,500
I think this is
about your life.

256
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:52,583
Mark twain.

257
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,959
You're the tuxedo guy
from the E.R.

258
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,041
Oh.

259
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:00,291
Oh, you're
the chocolate girl... woman.

260
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,041
I didn't recognize you.

261
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:05,041
I had a wig on
at the hospital,

262
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,917
out in public,
and listen,

263
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,166
I was really rude
the other day.

264
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,875
No, it's fine.
I understand.

265
00:12:09,917 --> 00:12:11,083
No, it's just, you know,

266
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,166
I've bonded with people
in this situation before,

267
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,458
not here, but in chemo,

268
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:19,041
and one day you show up,
and... she doesn't.

269
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,250
And you really want
to tell yourself

270
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:22,166
that she's in remission

271
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,834
and she's taking
that trip to Paris

272
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,291
that she's
always dreamed of.

273
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:28,041
But since you broke your own
rules and got friendly,

274
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,208
you're friends.

275
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:33,041
So her husband calls you
and tells you that she died.

276
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,041
Well, I'm sorry.

277
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,959
Me, too.

278
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,333
So we can chitchat,

279
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:41,083
'cause it's weird to sit here
and not say anything,

280
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:44,959
but it doesn't go
beyond that, okay?

281
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,041
Nice weather,
don't you think?

282
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,333
Beautiful.

283
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:51,333
Miranda?

284
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:52,291
See ya.

285
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,250
Yeah.

286
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,917
Hold still.

287
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:08,333
Got a minute?

288
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,375
No.

289
00:13:10,417 --> 00:13:12,041
I came to apologize.

290
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,792
The cops made an arrest
last night.

291
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,458
The guy who took Sarah Nelson
from the E.R.?

292
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,583
It wasn't your patient.

293
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,375
They found Sarah?

294
00:13:18,417 --> 00:13:20,041
Not yet, but they say
it's only a matter of time.

295
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,166
Who was it?

296
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,166
Contract worker
on the janitorial staff.

297
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,375
Since he wasn't
an actual hospital employee,

298
00:13:25,417 --> 00:13:27,125
it took a while
to connect the dots.

299
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:29,041
He's a registered
sex offender.

300
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,375
They're sure it's him?
Sounds like it.

301
00:13:31,417 --> 00:13:34,333
I heard from a paramedic.
He heard from a cop buddy.

302
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:35,583
I was a jerk.

303
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:39,250
I was out of line,
and I'm sorry.

304
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,625
No hard feelings?

305
00:13:41,667 --> 00:13:45,000
James, thank you.
Thank you.

306
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,709
You have to write
"whole cumin"?

307
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,417
I need whole cumin.

308
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:59,375
Yeah, but why not
just write "cumin"?

309
00:13:59,417 --> 00:14:00,917
You afraid you're gonna
get to the spice aisle

310
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,041
and see "cumin" on the list,
and accidentally buy it ground?

311
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,834
Well, I don't need ground cumin,
I need whole cumin...

312
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,709
Which is why I'm writing
"whole cumin."

313
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,417
Miranda?

314
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,417
I thought about
canceling today,

315
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:26,375
'cause I'm good.
Really good.

316
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:27,667
Well, why didn't you?

317
00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:30,625
You know things about me
that no one else does.

318
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:32,458
So sharing my happiness
with anyone else,

319
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,041
they don't...

320
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,250
Understand what it took
for you to get there?

321
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,959
Exactly. But you get it.

322
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,959
What do you do?

323
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,208
Guess.

324
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,000
Oh, come... I'm really
bad at guessing.

325
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,166
You can't be bad at guessing.
It's not a skill.

326
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,083
Just say random things.

327
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,583
Okay. Musician?

328
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:52,625
Yeah. I play
and teach violin.

329
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:53,709
How'd you guess that?

330
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,417
You had a violin
on your keychain.

331
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,208
I saw it in your hand
at the E.R.

332
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,375
That was ages ago.

333
00:14:58,417 --> 00:15:00,375
We didn't even know
each other then.

334
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:01,458
Well, paying attention
to detail

335
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,834
is an important part
of my job.

336
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,208
Which is?

337
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,875
Psychiatrist.

338
00:15:05,917 --> 00:15:08,000
Oh.

339
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,917
You take naps
on your couch?

340
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:11,291
You know, lately I do.

341
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,792
My oncologist told me
I'd be exhausted, but, uh...

342
00:15:13,834 --> 00:15:15,417
It's like kindergarten,
right?

343
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:16,583
Well, I keep waiting
for someone

344
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,458
to bring me
milk and cookies.

345
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,458
Miranda?

346
00:15:31,792 --> 00:15:33,041
Hold still.

347
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,959
I was thinking about
what you said last week

348
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,750
about discontinuing therapy,
since you feel okay.

349
00:15:37,792 --> 00:15:41,041
I don't want to.
I like coming here.

350
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:43,250
It's just...
When I feel good,

351
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:45,875
I can't help but wonder
if it's a crutch.

352
00:15:45,917 --> 00:15:47,291
Well, you know, a lot of people
have more difficulty

353
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,542
handling happiness
than trouble.

354
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,542
They feel they haven't
earned it.

355
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,083
Oh, I-I get that.

356
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:55,750
I mean, right now
I have everything

357
00:15:55,792 --> 00:15:57,709
a normal person
could ever want, you know?

358
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,041
But...

359
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:03,041
Given where we started,

360
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,917
do I deserve it?

361
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:08,375
Divorced, then briefly
back together,

362
00:16:08,417 --> 00:16:10,750
but it...
It's done now.

363
00:16:10,792 --> 00:16:13,583
Mine asked me for a divorce
in an e-mail.

364
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:16,458
I take it
you don't miss him, then?

365
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,959
Just sleeping
next to him.

366
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,333
He had a bad back,

367
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,041
and he slept on his side
facing out,

368
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,166
and I'd sleep
with my back next to his.

369
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:28,792
Not quite touching,
but close enough to feel warm.

370
00:16:28,834 --> 00:16:30,667
That part was nice.

371
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,208
I don't miss my ex.

372
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:39,041
She couldn't ever be...
Still.

373
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,166
It felt like we always had to
be busy doing something,

374
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,834
or she'd get bored.

375
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:48,041
It's better to have someone
you can just be alone with.

376
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,667
Yeah.

377
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,291
Miranda?

It hasn't happened yet.

386
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:22,041
We're...
We're taking it slow,

387
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:25,166
you know, physically.

388
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:26,250
Which is okay, I guess.

389
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,041
Well, there's no timetable.

390
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:29,583
I mean, it's up to you
and Alyssa

391
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,041
and your respective
comfort level.

392
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,125
I'm nervous.

393
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:35,667
I mean, I want to,
you know...

394
00:17:35,709 --> 00:17:37,041
Get closer to her.

395
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:40,291
But liking someone and being
attracted to them is one thing,

396
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,375
but...

397
00:17:42,417 --> 00:17:45,458
Sex just takes it

♪ I was coming for you ♪

399
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:50,041
Intimacy comes
in many forms, Nick.

400
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:53,166
And our culture pressures people
to believe that sex

401
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,208
is the ultimate expression
of love,

402
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,583
but that's not always
the case.

403
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:59,166
And waiting until it's right
and taking it slow,

404
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:02,250
you know, that's...
That's healthy.

You have the most boring
sock collection in the world.

409
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:22,083
I made a decision
not to let cancer change me,

410
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,333
not even my socks.

411
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,208
What does your shrink
say about that?

412
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,709
Every shrink has a shrink.

413
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,333
We don't talk
about my socks.

414
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,542
Here's something
I've never understood--

415
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:34,208
why do all psychiatrists
take off the month of August?

416
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,917
There must be a rash
of suicides then.

417
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:38,458
People can't just
put their issues on hold.

418
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,583
Cancer's not gonna
go away for a month.

419
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,041
You still need
to discuss it.

420
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:44,542
I take my vacation
in may.

421
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,166
And as for my cancer,

422
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,125
I don't really discuss it
with my therapist.

423
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:50,542
So who do you talk to,
then?

424
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,959
Honestly? You.

425
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,917
I don't want my colleagues
to know what's going on.

426
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:57,750
I don't want them
to start looking at me

427
00:18:57,792 --> 00:18:59,583
like I'm just cancer guy.

428
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,333
You understand.

429
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,375
Yeah, I do.

430
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,583
You know,
every beginning violin student

431
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:10,000
learns to play
"twinkle, twinkle, little star."

432
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:12,792
And at first, it's awful.

433
00:19:12,834 --> 00:19:15,834
And they play it over
and over and over

434
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:18,291
till I don't think I can
listen one more time,

435
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,166
and then it clicks.

436
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,834
The finger placement,
the pressure on the bow.

437
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,291
One day it's noise, and then
the next day, it's music.

438
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,417
I love that moment.

439
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,291
I'm really gonna miss that.

440
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,417
You don't teach violin
anymore?

441
00:19:33,834 --> 00:19:37,166
My cancer has metastasized.
It's in my brain.

442
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,834
So the radiation is just...

443
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:42,750
I promised my niece I would go
to her college graduation.

444
00:19:42,792 --> 00:19:44,917
So I'm holding on
as long as I can,

445
00:19:44,959 --> 00:19:48,041
but this is just delaying
the inevitable.

446
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:50,417
I'm terminal, Sheldon,

447
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,375
So you should probably

448
00:19:52,417 --> 00:19:55,583
find someone else to talk to.

449
00:19:56,834 --> 00:19:58,000
Miranda?

450
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,792
Hold still.

451
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,917
Ugh. How am I gonna
sign payroll next week?

452
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,834
Need one of those astronaut pens
that writes upside-down.

453
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:30,166
Makes your head hurt, too.

454
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,417
Mason tried laying like this
on the sofa at home.

455
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,208
Oh. How long
did you make it?

456
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,500
Ten minutes,

457
00:20:35,542 --> 00:20:37,083
then I thought my brains
were gonna explode.

458
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,500
Dad only made it five.

459
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:41,083
Well, clearly,
the man is weak.

460
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:43,417
I'm gonna go
to the vending machine.

461
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:44,667
You guys want anything?

462
00:20:44,709 --> 00:20:46,125
Mnh-mnh.
No, thank you.

463
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,041
Hey.

464
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,542
Come right back.

465
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:57,458
How are you holding up?

466
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,333
Ugh. How do you think?

467
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,166
I'm already jumping
out of my skin,

468
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:02,458
it hasn't been that long.

469
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,041
I got two more months laying
here like a sack of potatoes.

470
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,041
If I even think
about getting up to pee,

471
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,417
there's a whole chorus
of "hold still,"

472
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:10,041
like the world's
gonna come to an end

473
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,083
if I move half an inch.

474
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:14,041
It's no fun, Sheldon,
staying in one spot,

475
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,625
contemplating every bad thing
that could happen

476
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:19,542
on a continuous loop.
It's...

477
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:22,041
Oh, it's no fun.

478
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:24,709
I get that. I do.

479
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,041
Sheldon...

480
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:29,041
You have an abundance
of empathy,

481
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,750
but how could you possibly
imagine what this is like?

482
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,041
Well, this morning...

483
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,542
Well, every morning
for the past few weeks,

484
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,625
i-i--I've been going...

485
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,291
To the gym, and I use
a stationary bike,

486
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,250
and you know,
you just don't get anywhere,

487
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:49,917
no matter how hard
you pedal.

488
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:51,083
And I'm not losing
any weight.

489
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:52,750
I mean, look at me.

490
00:21:52,792 --> 00:21:55,000
So you do understand.

491
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:58,083
You're right. I have no idea
what this is like.

492
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:01,041
But you're
the strongest person I know.

493
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:03,834
And just being around you,
I...

494
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:08,000
I think it gives me
strength, too.

495
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:18,166
You're late.

496
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:22,041
Yeah. Traffic.

497
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:25,291
So I was thinking of trying
this lunch place down the street

498
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:27,417
that has salads with
really motivational names,

499
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:31,250
like "you can conquer anything"
and "it's never too late."

500
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:34,750
Let me know
if it's any good.

501
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,083
Miranda?

502
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:57,041
Hold still.

503
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:59,041
Why didn't you go to lunch
with Miranda?

504
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:02,041
Our friendship doesn't go
outside that room.

505
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:03,041
That's the rule.

506
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:05,125
I think it's already
outside that room,

507
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:07,000
and you know it.

508
00:23:09,917 --> 00:23:11,041
She told me
she's terminal.

509
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:13,041
Aha.

510
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:15,041
What "aha"?

511
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:17,041
Not everyone
has the strength of character

512
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:18,792
to go through this
with someone.

513
00:23:18,834 --> 00:23:21,041
At least that's what
we discussed with Laura.

514
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:23,500
Well, I'm not Laura.
Laura was selfish.

515
00:23:23,542 --> 00:23:25,041
Or scared.

516
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:27,041
Getting closer to someone
who's sick is terrifying.

517
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:28,375
No, it's not
the same thing.

518
00:23:28,417 --> 00:23:30,375
Laura and I
have a 20-year history.

519
00:23:30,417 --> 00:23:33,041
I met Miranda
seven weeks ago.

520
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:35,291
We spend five minutes a day
together five days a week,

521
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:38,291
and our--our friendship
is, uh...

522
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,875
Three hours old.

523
00:23:39,917 --> 00:23:42,041
And yet, the experiences
you're sharing--

524
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:44,875
that creates a deeper bond
than you would normally have

525
00:23:44,917 --> 00:23:46,959
with someone you've known
for three hours.

526
00:23:49,542 --> 00:23:51,709
I like her.

527
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,083
But I...

528
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:57,417
I can't take the next step.

529
00:23:57,458 --> 00:23:59,083
Why?

530
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:01,208
What are you afraid of?

531
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:06,000
Everything.

532
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:11,333
How are Ron and Dana?

533
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:13,250
Imaginations
are running wild.

534
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:14,792
How could they not?

535
00:24:14,834 --> 00:24:15,959
The guy in custody
had their daughter

536
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
for how many days
before he was arrested?

537
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:19,583
54.

538
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,291
I mean, if you think about what
could have happened to her...

539
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:22,500
I don't wanna.

540
00:24:22,542 --> 00:24:23,750
Well, people are stronger
than you think.

541
00:24:23,792 --> 00:24:25,500
And kids can survive
most anything

542
00:24:25,542 --> 00:24:27,792
if they get
the right kind of help.
Well, to be helped,

543
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:30,041
Sarah has to
actually be found,

544
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:31,667
you know, alive.

545
00:24:31,709 --> 00:24:33,041
And who's to say
the guy in custody

546
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:34,291
is even the one
who took Sarah?

547
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:36,125
The guy did it before.
As far as I'm concerned,

548
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:38,041
he should be tortured whether
it helps find Sarah or not.

549
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:39,458
Oh, my god.
I'm serious.

550
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,083
You know what? I got Mason,
I got two on the way,

551
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:42,250
I have a baby
in the nicu

552
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:43,792
who's never done anything
to anybody.

553
00:24:43,834 --> 00:24:45,583
I have no sympathy
for a pedophile. I'm sorry.

554
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:47,917
I like vigilante Coop.
Where'd he come from?

555
00:24:47,959 --> 00:24:50,166
Vigilante Coop is just a guy
who put a bid in on a house

556
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:52,291
and then he checked
the sex offender registry.

557
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:54,625
You know how many live
within a 5-mile radius

558
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:56,959
of our dream house?
Six.

559
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,959
And those are just the ones
that are registered.

560
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,625
Four blocks away,
there's a guy that did time

561
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:02,625
for sexual penetration
with a--
oh, stop. Stop, Coop.

562
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,583
No, Cooper's right.

563
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:07,041
It seems like there are
more of them right now,

564
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:10,750
but that's because people think
it's okay to talk about it.

565
00:25:10,792 --> 00:25:12,417
They have a disease,
they want our support,

566
00:25:12,458 --> 00:25:14,125
they want our help,
they want us to tell them

567
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:15,709
that god
didn't make them wrong.

568
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:18,041
But I mean,
how can we do that?

569
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,875
There's some maladies that
are simply contrary to nature,

570
00:25:20,917 --> 00:25:22,041
and there are some people

571
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:24,041
that no loving god
would put on this earth

572
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:25,667
unless it was to demonstrate
to the rest of us

573
00:25:25,709 --> 00:25:28,041
that there was a limit
to humanity

574
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:30,000
and Patience
and compassion...

575
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:34,333
Which further justifies
my utter lack of faith.

576
00:25:34,375 --> 00:25:35,959
The only life
some people deserve

577
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,166
is a life sentence.

578
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:39,875
And yet,
we help them live freely,

579
00:25:39,917 --> 00:25:41,458
and while we do that,

580
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,250
we're supposed to be able
to sleep at night.

581
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:57,542
Nick, are you all right?

582
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:02,041
You know how
you imagine something, and...

583
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:04,417
In the beginning
it feels amazing,

584
00:26:04,458 --> 00:26:07,917
but then slowly,
the reality sets in.

585
00:26:07,959 --> 00:26:10,041
It just isn't
what you planned.

586
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:11,291
Is this about Alyssa?

587
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:13,792
I thought it was love.

588
00:26:13,834 --> 00:26:18,041
But real love...
That's supposed to grow,

589
00:26:18,083 --> 00:26:22,041
right, over time?

590
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:24,417
One hopes.

591
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:28,041
Well, it's not growing
for me.

592
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:31,458
She just doesn't seem happy,
no matter what I do.

593
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:37,041
Maybe this wasn't
meant to be.

594
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:39,542
Every relationship
is exciting at the start.

595
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:41,542
The person you're with
is a blank canvas,

596
00:26:41,583 --> 00:26:43,542
and everything is new.

597
00:26:43,583 --> 00:26:45,417
Of course, the novelty fades,
and sometimes

598
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:47,542
you have to give
that relationship time,

599
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:49,041
you know,
to--to really know--

600
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:51,500
maybe love just isn't
in the cards for me.

601
00:26:51,542 --> 00:26:54,667
Nick, you're a young man.

602
00:26:54,709 --> 00:26:57,000
The search
for the right woman...

603
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,792
Alyssa's not her.

604
00:27:02,834 --> 00:27:08,875
And, uh...
I don't wanna hurt her, but...

605
00:27:08,917 --> 00:27:11,000
I think I have to end it.

606
00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:48,375
♪♪♪

607
00:28:02,792 --> 00:28:04,041
The Sarah Nelson case.

608
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:05,709
I think you might have
the wrong man in custody.

609
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,000
Why would you say that?

610
00:28:07,041 --> 00:28:08,834
What do you have
on your suspect?

611
00:28:08,875 --> 00:28:10,542
Well, he's a registered
sex offender.

612
00:28:10,583 --> 00:28:12,583
Did it at least
once before.

613
00:28:12,625 --> 00:28:15,041
Same type--
blonde, blue eyes...

614
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:17,333
They all have a type.

615
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:20,458
Four witnesses put him
in the emergency room

616
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,375
mopping floors minutes
before the girl went missing.

617
00:28:23,417 --> 00:28:25,792
And that was ten minutes
after his shift was over.

618
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:27,041
That's evidence?

619
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:28,750
Been a cop 30 years,
shelley.

620
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:31,250
He's a lowlife,
through and through.

621
00:28:31,291 --> 00:28:33,250
Yeah, but...
But he hasn't confessed.

622
00:28:33,291 --> 00:28:34,583
Why would he?

623
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:37,208
We got him on felony possession
of child pornography

624
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,041
and parole violation.

625
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:40,166
He's not gonna add life
on top of that

626
00:28:40,208 --> 00:28:42,458
just to help us
with our investigation.

627
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,041
All right.

628
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:45,667
All right.

629
00:28:45,709 --> 00:28:47,041
I'm breaking protocol,

630
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:48,041
I'm breaking probably
the law,

631
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:49,458
and I'm risking my...

632
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,875
I'm risking my license
by saying this,

633
00:28:51,917 --> 00:28:54,500
but I count you
as a friend, Joe.

634
00:28:56,458 --> 00:28:57,875
All right.

635
00:28:57,917 --> 00:28:59,667
I had a patient who was
at the hospital that night,

636
00:28:59,709 --> 00:29:01,041
and... I think
he took Sarah.

637
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:03,083
He has a history
of sexual urges toward children.

638
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:05,041
Has he said anything
about the girl?
No, no, no.

639
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:07,000
He's too smart.
You know, he knows the rules.

640
00:29:07,041 --> 00:29:08,417
But he was in love
with someone,

641
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:10,500
and now he's having mood swings
because it went bad,

642
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:12,291
and I think
if that someone is Sarah,

643
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,041
he could be getting ready
to hurt her.

644
00:29:14,083 --> 00:29:16,041
You're not giving me anything
to go on here, shelley.

645
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:18,208
I can't bust down the door
to a guy's house

646
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,417
without probable cause.

647
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:21,291
Joe, come on.
I-I just have a feeling.

648
00:29:21,333 --> 00:29:22,625
A feeling?

649
00:29:22,667 --> 00:29:24,417
Now I know you're a shrink,
but come on.

650
00:29:24,458 --> 00:29:27,083
She's out there.
He could have her. He...

651
00:29:27,125 --> 00:29:28,458
You have to do something.

652
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,041
Look, the best we can hope now
is to find her body

653
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:34,083
so that the parents
have something to Bury.

654
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:37,375
You can't give up on her.

655
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,375
I'm sorry, shelley.
There's nothing I can do.

656
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,500
Nick. Hey.

657
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,917
Thanks for
coming back so soon.

658
00:29:56,959 --> 00:29:58,500
I-I have to leave town
next week,

659
00:29:58,542 --> 00:30:00,166
I wanted to make sure
we didn't miss an appointment.

660
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:02,041
No problem.
Okay.

661
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:04,792
So did you... did you have
any trouble getting here?

662
00:30:04,834 --> 00:30:07,583
'Cause traffic can be heavy
this time of day.

663
00:30:07,625 --> 00:30:09,834
No. No trouble at all.

664
00:30:14,542 --> 00:30:15,750
Well, why don't you wait
in my office?

665
00:30:15,792 --> 00:30:17,375
And I'll, uh,
I'll be right there.

666
00:30:17,417 --> 00:30:18,333
Sure.

667
00:30:18,375 --> 00:30:20,000
Okay.

668
00:30:25,625 --> 00:30:28,375
Could you please make this call
in 15 minutes?

669
00:30:28,417 --> 00:30:32,041
Okay. It's important.
Thank you.

670
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:41,041
How's it going
with Alyssa?

671
00:30:41,083 --> 00:30:43,041
Oh, the same.

672
00:30:43,083 --> 00:30:44,792
So you didn't end it?

673
00:30:44,834 --> 00:30:46,709
Not yet.

674
00:30:50,125 --> 00:30:53,041
I'm sorry, but that couple
in the lobby--

675
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:55,166
this is
highly unprofessional,

676
00:30:55,208 --> 00:30:57,125
but I am...
I'm distracted.

677
00:30:57,166 --> 00:30:58,375
Why?

678
00:30:58,417 --> 00:30:59,959
Well, they were the parents

679
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,792
of that little girl that went
missing from the E.R.

680
00:31:02,834 --> 00:31:04,250
"Were"?
What?

681
00:31:04,291 --> 00:31:06,125
You said they "were"
the parents

682
00:31:06,166 --> 00:31:08,667
of that missing girl,
but...

683
00:31:08,709 --> 00:31:11,166
They're still her parents.
Well, not if she's dead.

684
00:31:11,208 --> 00:31:13,458
Well, yeah,
but maybe she's okay.

685
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,125
Maybe she's doing
even better.

686
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:16,125
How do you figure?

687
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,417
I was there that night.

688
00:31:18,458 --> 00:31:19,875
Those parents are awful.

689
00:31:19,917 --> 00:31:22,041
Fighting like that
in front of her?

690
00:31:22,083 --> 00:31:24,750
That's... that's no way
for a kid to live.

691
00:31:24,792 --> 00:31:27,291
Kids need to be loved.

692
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:29,041
Yes, they do.
Yeah.

693
00:31:29,083 --> 00:31:31,166
They absolutely do.

694
00:31:31,208 --> 00:31:33,208
So you think maybe
she's still alive?

695
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,208
Sarah?

696
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:36,458
Yes.

697
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:40,000
I do.
I think she's okay.

698
00:31:41,834 --> 00:31:44,083
I can't sit home anymore
and just wait.

699
00:31:44,125 --> 00:31:45,291
I can't do it.

700
00:31:45,333 --> 00:31:47,417
Well, I can't pretend
that we never had a kid.

701
00:31:47,458 --> 00:31:48,417
That's not what I'm doing.

702
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:49,917
Dana, this isn't helping.

703
00:31:49,959 --> 00:31:51,375
Please, why don't you
tell me what's going on?

704
00:31:51,417 --> 00:31:53,250
We have to pay the mortgage.
We have to eat.

705
00:31:53,291 --> 00:31:56,000
He went back to work.
Our baby is missing,

706
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:58,041
and he is treating it
like it's a regular day.

707
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,625
Right, but we have
discussed this.

708
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:02,333
Even though two people
share the same loss,

709
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:05,208
they may not experience or deal
with grief the same way.

710
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:07,041
Exactly.
And for a few hours a day

711
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:08,417
when I'm in court,
I can forget.

712
00:32:08,458 --> 00:32:12,667
Well, I can't, and I won't.

713
00:32:12,709 --> 00:32:16,041
Dana, she's dead.

714
00:32:16,083 --> 00:32:19,250
What's wrong with you?
How could you say that?

715
00:32:19,291 --> 00:32:20,709
I just needed
to say it out loud.

716
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:23,542
I... can't walk around
on eggshells anymore

717
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:26,041
and pretend to hope.
I... I'm not hopeful.

718
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:27,458
Dr. Turner,
you are a mother.

719
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,208
You tell him he is wrong.

720
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:32,041
Well, we just...
We don't know.

721
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:35,041
I know.

722
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:37,083
A mother knows.

723
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:39,291
Sarah is alive.

724
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:41,375
I feel like there's something
you're not telling me.

725
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:43,125
What are you talking about?

726
00:32:43,166 --> 00:32:44,750
Your depression.

727
00:32:44,792 --> 00:32:46,959
I'm not depressed.

728
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,083
I just said my relationship
isn't working.

729
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:50,375
Well, you came to me
in the beginning

730
00:32:50,417 --> 00:32:51,667
because you wanted help,

731
00:32:51,709 --> 00:32:54,000
because you don't like
what you are.

732
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:56,333
What I am?

733
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:59,041
You said
that's not my fault.

734
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:00,041
The urges
aren't your fault,

735
00:33:00,083 --> 00:33:01,667
but acting on them
would be.

736
00:33:01,709 --> 00:33:04,959
You'd be responsible
for that.

737
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,750
Are you accusing me
of something?

738
00:33:06,792 --> 00:33:08,375
No. No, I'm just
asking you to be honest,

739
00:33:08,417 --> 00:33:10,291
because our deal,
after I saved your life,

740
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:12,125
was... no more secrets.

741
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:13,417
I didn't ask you
to save my life.

742
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:15,333
You took a bottle of pills
and came to my office, Nick--

743
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:17,041
a doctor's office.

744
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:18,291
What did you think
would happen?

745
00:33:18,333 --> 00:33:21,041
I thought I wouldn't be alone
when I died.

746
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:22,125
You know,
the terms that we discussed

747
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,625
for my continuing
to help you--

748
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:26,291
the only requirement
was your honesty.

749
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:28,000
I've been honest.

750
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:32,333
Who's Alyssa?

751
00:33:32,375 --> 00:33:34,333
The woman I've been seeing.

752
00:33:34,375 --> 00:33:35,583
Where's she from?

753
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:36,834
Here.

754
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:38,041
What does she do?

755
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:40,083
She's, um... a waitress.

756
00:33:40,125 --> 00:33:43,083
I don't have to keep
answering these questions.

757
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:44,208
Where does she live, Nick?

758
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:46,750
Venice.

759
00:33:46,792 --> 00:33:48,041
Do you have a photograph?

760
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:49,333
No.
Not even on your phone?

761
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:52,000
What color are her eyes?
Are they blue?

762
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:54,125
And her hair blonde, too,
like Sarah?

763
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:57,041
Because there is no Alyssa.
It's only Sarah,

764
00:33:57,083 --> 00:33:58,041
and you took her.

765
00:33:58,083 --> 00:34:00,709
And that's how you know
she's still alive.

766
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:03,792
Sarah is dead, okay?

767
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:05,542
And you keep encouraging her
to hope, Dr. Turner.

768
00:34:05,583 --> 00:34:08,166
It's gonna kill her.
I don't know that, Ron.

769
00:34:08,208 --> 00:34:10,125
You don't know that.
They have the guy
in custody.

770
00:34:10,166 --> 00:34:12,208
That's what the detective said.
He's the guy.

771
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,041
And if they didn't find Sarah
after a couple of days,

772
00:34:14,083 --> 00:34:16,000
the odds that they were
ever gonna find her alive--

773
00:34:16,041 --> 00:34:18,291
the detective doesn't know
our baby. He doesn't know us.

774
00:34:18,333 --> 00:34:21,041
It is just a job to him.
He is on to the next case.

775
00:34:21,083 --> 00:34:23,250
We are the ones who are
supposed to keep caring.

776
00:34:23,291 --> 00:34:25,500
I'm the only one caring!

777
00:34:25,542 --> 00:34:27,250
Dana, Ron cares. He cares.

778
00:34:27,291 --> 00:34:28,291
Of course I care!

779
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:30,417
Do you even know what it means
if she's alive?

780
00:34:30,458 --> 00:34:32,166
Do you know
what that means,

781
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:35,000
what he must have done
to her?

782
00:34:35,041 --> 00:34:37,458
All those nights that you
sat there taking pills,

783
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,291
I was awake
staring at the wall,

784
00:34:39,333 --> 00:34:41,709
and I couldn't stop
imagining...

785
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:45,041
In your dreams, you could hear
Sarah asking to bake cupcakes.

786
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,709
But all I could hear
was her screaming...

787
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:51,083
Screaming
for daddy to come save her.

788
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:53,834
I need to think
that she's dead, Dana,

789
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:56,041
because otherwise...

790
00:34:56,083 --> 00:34:57,709
Oh, my god,
I can't even...

791
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:00,041
You are wrong.

792
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:01,417
Her parents fought
and she ran away,

793
00:35:01,458 --> 00:35:02,875
and when you left
the E.R. that night,

794
00:35:02,917 --> 00:35:04,250
you found her outside,
didn't you?

795
00:35:04,291 --> 00:35:06,041
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

796
00:35:06,083 --> 00:35:09,250
She was upset, scared,
probably hiding from the rain.

797
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:10,458
I mean, what did you do?
Did you charm her?

798
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,625
Did you buy her something?

799
00:35:11,667 --> 00:35:13,041
How did you get her
to go home with you?

800
00:35:13,083 --> 00:35:15,041
You're crazy.
I get it, Nick. I do.

801
00:35:15,083 --> 00:35:16,208
You wanted to give her
a better life.

802
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,500
I mean, that's it,
isn't it?

803
00:35:17,542 --> 00:35:19,125
Why would I keep coming here
if I took her?

804
00:35:19,166 --> 00:35:20,709
That doesn't make any sense.

805
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,291
Because you want to tell me.

806
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:24,542
Just like you wanted
to share your joy with me,

807
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:25,750
and now you want to confess,

808
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:28,041
because the urges,
they got to be too much.

809
00:35:28,083 --> 00:35:29,959
You couldn't stop yourself.

810
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,291
You never thought
you could help me.
But she doesn't love you.

811
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:33,792
How could she?
She's a child.

812
00:35:33,834 --> 00:35:35,291
And she doesn't want
to be with you.

813
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,041
And maybe you haven't been
able to be a man with her.

814
00:35:37,083 --> 00:35:38,250
Maybe you couldn't perform,

815
00:35:38,291 --> 00:35:40,083
and maybe that's
why you're depressed.

816
00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:41,083
God, you're guessing!

817
00:35:41,125 --> 00:35:44,041
You're... you're guessing.

818
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:46,041
You're making this up
as you go along.

819
00:35:46,083 --> 00:35:49,125
You think you're so smart,
but you don't know anything.

820
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:52,041
You're powerless.

821
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:55,083
You are powerless
and weak.

822
00:35:55,125 --> 00:35:57,041
Where is she?

823
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:59,041
I have no idea.

824
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:00,166
Where is she?!

825
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:02,125
I can't help you.

826
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,041
He's acutely suicidal
and combative.
What the hell?

827
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:11,709
He's paranoid
and externalizing,

828
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:14,041
so expect accusations
of persecution.
What are you talking about?

829
00:36:14,083 --> 00:36:16,625
Now he is sleep-deprived,
so we'll need one-on-ones

830
00:36:16,667 --> 00:36:18,083
until he can be
heavily sedated.

831
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:20,333
Sedated? No, I'm not suicidal.
I'm totally--I'm fine.

832
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:22,083
I'll follow up directly
with the intake doctor.

833
00:36:22,125 --> 00:36:24,709
We're putting you on
a 5150 psych hold, okay?

834
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,333
It's for your own safety.

835
00:36:26,375 --> 00:36:30,583
No, no, you can't do this.
I haven't done anything!

836
00:36:30,625 --> 00:36:33,041
It's gonna be okay, Nick.

837
00:36:39,083 --> 00:36:40,166
Shelley, I just did a double.
I'm going home.

838
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:41,375
My patient, Nick Calhoun,
has Sarah.

839
00:36:41,417 --> 00:36:43,208
He took her and he has her
at his house.

840
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:45,041
So what changed
since this morning, huh?

841
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:46,333
You get some proof?

842
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:47,583
No, I'm telling you
I know.

843
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:49,417
How? Did you see her
at his house?

844
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:52,041
Did he tell you
that he has her?

845
00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:55,875
Yes. He told me.
Nick confessed.

846
00:36:58,709 --> 00:36:59,667
You know where he is?

847
00:36:59,709 --> 00:37:00,917
He's 5150.

848
00:37:00,959 --> 00:37:01,959
You had him committed?

849
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,583
He was in danger
of hurting himself.

850
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:05,792
Or someone else.
Yes.

851
00:37:05,834 --> 00:37:08,291
That's probable cause.
Let's go.

852
00:37:08,333 --> 00:37:10,250
Okay.

853
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:20,667
Living room clear!

854
00:37:22,208 --> 00:37:23,709
Kitchen clear!

855
00:37:25,458 --> 00:37:26,667
Bedroom clear!

856
00:37:26,709 --> 00:37:28,041
Shelley?

857
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:31,250
She's here. She...
She has to be here.

858
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:34,000
There's a basement.

859
00:38:02,709 --> 00:38:06,166
She's
under there. Find the lights.

860
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:12,709
Hi, Sarah.

861
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,250
My name is Sheldon.
I'm here with the police.

862
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:18,041
And we're--we're gonna
take you home, okay?

863
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:21,291
Is he...
Is he coming back?

864
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:24,667
No. No, sweetie.
You're--you're safe now.

865
00:38:24,709 --> 00:38:29,041
Where's my mommy?

866
00:38:29,083 --> 00:38:31,041
They'll be here soon.

867
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:32,291
Your mommy and daddy
are on the way.

868
00:38:32,333 --> 00:38:33,250
It's gonna take
a little while.

869
00:38:33,291 --> 00:38:35,166
So you...
You wanna come out?

870
00:38:35,208 --> 00:38:36,125
No.

871
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:39,542
Okay.
Okay. That's okay.

872
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:41,500
You're not gonna
leave me, are you?

873
00:38:41,542 --> 00:38:44,500
No. No, I'm gonna wait
right here.

874
00:38:44,542 --> 00:38:46,000
I'll tell you what--

875
00:38:46,041 --> 00:38:48,333
I'll--I'll just put my hand
right here,

876
00:38:48,375 --> 00:38:52,041

I was bad. I ran away.

No, no. That's--that's okay.

881
00:39:02,291 --> 00:39:05,291
I'm scared. I want
my mommy to sing to me.
