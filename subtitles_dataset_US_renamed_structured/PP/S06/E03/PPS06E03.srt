168
00:06:22,834 --> 00:06:25,417

to give me a p.S.A. Test

169
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,250

of my life.

Sheldon.

174

Now it doesn't necessarily mean
you have prostate cancer, but--

175
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,583

179
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:52,834

180

181
00:06:54,834 --> 00:06:57,792
Adam, you came to see me because
you know you have a problem.

182
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:01,041
So let's talk about it.
How does the anger start?

183
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,750
Is there anything specific
that sets it off?

184
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,917
Honestly...

185
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,500
It feels random.

186
00:07:07,542 --> 00:07:10,458
Like, last week,
my wife wouldn't shut up

187
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,041
about the drapes
in the dining room.

188
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,041
I mean, who cares about drapes
in a dining room?

189
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,917
So...

190
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,542
I snapped at her.

191
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:20,709
I mean, look,
I apologized immediately.

192
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,500
You know, I mean,
I know I was being an ass.

193
00:07:23,542 --> 00:07:25,041
And then there's
this guy at work.

194
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,500
He always takes
the last cold soda.

195
00:07:26,542 --> 00:07:28,208
Doesn't put anything
back in the fridge.

196
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,709
All he's gotta do is just pick
it up and just put it in there.

197
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,917
Does he know
how you feel about this?

198
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:34,875
Well, he does now.
I threw a can at him.

199
00:07:34,917 --> 00:07:39,166
Look, I-I know that
what I did was wrong, but--

200
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,667
it's all right to feel
whatever you feel.

201
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:44,000
It is not all right to behave
however you want to behave.

202
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:46,667
Okay, so a-are there
some tricks I can use?

203
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:50,041
Like, my brother Ricky--he tried
hypnosis to quit smoking.

204
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,917
Well, anger
doesn't really work that way.

205
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,291
It's not a habit.

206
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,000
So in order to help you,

207
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,542
we really need to know
the underlying causes.

208
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,250
Some people get angry
when they feel

209
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:59,667
they haven't gotten
what they deserve.

210
00:07:59,709 --> 00:08:02,542
For others, it comes
from fear or vulnerability.

211
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:05,333
Guilt can also be a trigger.

212
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,250
Um...

213
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:15,291
What are the rules here?

214
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:19,000
I need to know
if I can trust you.

215
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,583
A-Anything you say
is protected

216
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,500
by the doctor/patient
relationship.

217
00:08:22,542 --> 00:08:24,750
Anything?
Well,
there are two exceptions--

218
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:26,041
if you've ever abused a child

219
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,375
or if you are planning
to commit a crime.

220
00:08:28,417 --> 00:08:31,041
So if it was...

221
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,208
In the past--

222
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,041
it stays between us.

223
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,500
I don't know.
I don't think that I can.

224
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:40,000
You can tell me, Adam.
It's okay.

225
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,792
What is it? What happened?

226
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:50,166
11 years ago, I shot someone.

227
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,000
Okay?

228
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,542
I shot someone.

229
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:59,750
Our daughter, Jenny,
she was 21,

230
00:08:59,792 --> 00:09:02,792
just finished college, and she
was backpacking across Europe,

231
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:04,750
and she had one more week.

232
00:09:04,792 --> 00:09:06,542
So I called, left a message.

233
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,041
You know, what do you say
to a voice mail?

234
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:11,125
So I, uh,
I told her to call me,

235
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:14,041
and, uh, she did...

236
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,625
From the Moulin Rouge.

237
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:18,000
And she was so excited,

238
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,667
just going on and on,

239
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:21,667
and when she said,
"how are you?"

240
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:24,667
I couldn't tell her.
I-I couldn't do it.

241
00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:26,083
So I said--
and this just came out--

242
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:28,208
I said,
"Tracey was in the shower."

243
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,583
I mean, she's just a kid,

244
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:34,417
and those four words--
"your mother is dead"...

245
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,417
They were gonna
change her life forever,

246
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:41,083
so if I could give her
one more week...

247
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,000
Why not?

248
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Who did you shoot?

249
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,333
I don't know his name.

250
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,083
I was 18.

251
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,709
A stupid kid.

252
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,083
I mean, you gotta understand,

253
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,625
back then, it was just me
and my baby brother growing up.

254
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:06,291
We had two different dads
who we never met.

255
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,250
Our mom--she bailed.

256
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:09,625
We had nothing.

257
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:12,542
I mean, what would you do if you
saw your baby brother hungry,

258
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,458
crying, cold?

259
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,750
Tell me what happened.

260
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,583
Um...

261
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,083
It was, uh...

262
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,959
It was super bowl.

263
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,375
A guy came out of this
fancy Italian joint on pico.

264
00:10:31,417 --> 00:10:33,375
Look, Ricky was 13.

265
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:35,875
He was all bones, no coat.

266
00:10:35,917 --> 00:10:38,917
He didn't deserve that.

267
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,000
So I got a gun. I wasn't
planning on shooting it.

268
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:45,291
It was just to...

269
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:49,750
Look, I just needed to get us
some money, some food.

270
00:10:49,792 --> 00:10:51,125
So it was a robbery?

271
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:56,125
If I could go back
and change it...

272
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,291
But the guy--
he wouldn't give me his money.

273
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:03,875
He lunged at me, and I panicked,
and the gun went off.

274
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,291
And then I ran.

275
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,041
What happened
to the guy you shot?

276
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:13,166
I don't know

277
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,208
and I don't need to know.

278
00:11:18,834 --> 00:11:21,750
Dress the wound,
then get an X-ray.

279
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,333
Hi.

280
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:27,834
Hi.

281
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,083
I know you said you didn't
have time to have lunch

282
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,041
with me today, but I wanted
to make sure that you ate.

283
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,041
Thanks.

284
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,792
Sandwich
with a side of broccoli--

285
00:11:33,834 --> 00:11:35,166
jammed with nutrients--

286
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:38,000
and also two kinds of soup--
lentils and chicken noodle.

287
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,208
Lentils are great. They got
iron, they got folic acid,

288
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,542
they got protein,
and, you know,

289
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,208
chicken soup has sustained
my people for centuries.

290
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,000
Thank you.
There's also a plum,

291
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,333
which I don't know about
the nutritional value,

292
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:49,041
but in a symbolic
point of view,

293
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,458
you know that the cooplettes are
the size of plums right now?

294
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,625
Now that you could tell with you
since you're barely showing.

295
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:55,041
Where's the on-call
oral surgeon?

296
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,667
We paged Dr. Walker twice.

297
00:11:56,709 --> 00:11:57,875
Well, then page him again

298
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,250
and get this guy
an abdominal C.T.

299
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:00,834
Ask me how I know that.

300
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,208
What?

301
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,500
How the cooplettes are
the size of plums.

302
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:06,458
Honey, i--

303
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,041
how do you know that?

304
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,667
There's an app for it.
I downloaded it this morning.

305
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:13,041
Sends you all sorts of
information about the babies,

306
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,375
about what to expect.

307
00:12:14,417 --> 00:12:16,291
In two weeks, they're gonna be
the size of avocados.

308
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,709
Oh, then you'll bring me
some guacamole.

309
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,792
I'm really busy here, Coop.
Yeah, I know.

310
00:12:20,834 --> 00:12:22,291
You've been pulling
shifts at the E.R. for months.

311
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,500
Just hire someone.

312
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:24,917
I can't hire just anyone.

313
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,500
It takes time to find
the right person.

314
00:12:26,542 --> 00:12:28,041
Well, I think you're being
overly picky,

315
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,041
and you can't keep this up,

316
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,375
especially now.

317
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:36,041
The plums need you
off your feet.

318
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,667
I have to go.

319
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,458
I brought you an iced tea
from downstairs.

320
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,041
Thank you.

321
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,458
So how's it feel
being back at work?

322
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,250
Ah, work keeps me busy.

323
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,208
It's helpful to feel helpful,
you know?

324
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,250
Yeah.

325
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,542
My patient had an important
breakthrough today.

326
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,333
It's a--it's a tricky one.

327
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:03,875
He did something
when he was younger.

328
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:05,208
He shot a man.
He fled the scene.

329
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,041
He doesn't know what happened.
Does he want to know?

330
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,208
He says he doesn't,

331
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,458
but the guilt is
eating him alive.

332
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,959
I mean, maybe he does want
to know, but--but his denial--

333
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,709
no. No. You're a psychiatrist,
not a detective.

334
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,458
Well, no, I didn't say--
you didn't have to.

335
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,041
Your patient didn't ask you
to research this,

336
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,542
and going behind his back is
a betrayal of his trust,

337
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:22,959
and without that trust,

338
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,041
the patient can no longer
engage in therapy,

339
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,375
and--and you can't help him.

340
00:13:25,417 --> 00:13:26,750
But what if the man
is still alive?

341
00:13:26,792 --> 00:13:28,250
I mean, if it's good news,

342
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,166
I could tell him, and a huge
burden would be lifted.

343
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,625
Yeah, what if it
isn't good news?

344
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:33,542
What if your patient is,
in fact, a murderer? What then?

345
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,083
You--you think you're gonna be
able to keep this to yourself?

346
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,917
Of course.
No, I'm not so sure.

347
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,959
If his victim is dead,
you're gonna judge him.

348
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,875
You're gonna know that
your patient is a murderer,

349
00:13:40,917 --> 00:13:42,250
and it's gonna color
how you feel about him.

350
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,041
It's a pandora's box, Violet,

351
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,041
and, you know,
it's not yours to open.

352
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,417
Leave it alone.

353
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:51,375
Hey.

354
00:13:51,417 --> 00:13:53,083
What's with the smile?

355
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,417
Lydia riggins.

356
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,542
18 months--that's how long
we've been trying.

357
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,000
And now she's pregnant.

358
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,208
Congratulations.

359
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,625
You okay?

360
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:02,959
You sure?

361
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,083
You don't really seem okay.

362
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:06,208
You're right.

363
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,083
I'm--i don't know.

364
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,208
I don't mean to be not okay.
I'm sorry.

365
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:14,041
Look, a friend died, and it's--
it's a lot to deal with.

366
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:16,792
Well, I will be fine.

367
00:14:16,834 --> 00:14:19,000
People die all the time,
you know?

368
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,125
I've lost my mom,

369
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:23,041
Pete, and now Mark.

370
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,041
It's what it is.

371
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,542
It seems like more.

372
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,041
No.

373
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,875
I gotta head
to the birthing suite.

374
00:14:29,917 --> 00:14:32,208
You are not the only one
who brings life into the world.

375
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,125
Well, if you want to talk...

376
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:38,750
You know, I think
you actually might be a Saint.

377
00:14:38,792 --> 00:14:41,208
Thank you.

378
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:50,583
It's a teakettle.

379
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:53,291
Doesn't telling me defeat
the purpose of wrapping it?

380
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,291
Yeah. I guess.

381
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,291
We thought it'd be
a perfect housewarming gift.

382
00:14:57,333 --> 00:15:00,041
Oh, I love it.
Thank you.

383
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,250
Hey, can I ask you something?

384
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:03,792
Yeah,
it comes in other colors.

385
00:15:03,834 --> 00:15:06,041
I mean, I said we should get
red, and Charlotte was like, no.

386
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,041
No. No. No. I-I love
the kettle. It's perfect.

387
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,667
Oh.
I--

388
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:14,041
uh, supposed there's someone,
and you want to help them,

389
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,250
but they claim
that they don't want your help.

390
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,542
Oh, is it--is it Addison?

391
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:19,709
No.

392
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,041
No? Sam? Is it Sam?

393
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,041
No. No. You don't know them,
Cooper.

394
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,041
Oh, it's a patient.

395
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,333
Okay, you know what?
Forget I asked.

396
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:27,417
How are you,

397
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:30,667
you,
of the mighty olympian sperm?

398
00:15:30,709 --> 00:15:33,041
Ah. Gold, silver...

399
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,917
And bronze.

400
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,333
Um, I'd be better if I saw

401
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,083
the mother of my soon-to-be
children a little bit more.

402
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,083
She's picking up all sorts
of shifts in the E.R.,

403
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:44,041
and she's just--she's running
herself into the ground.

404
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,667
Well, sometimes work can be

405
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:47,083
the best way
to occupy your mind.

406
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:50,041
From something bad.
This is a good th--i mean--

407
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:53,125
Coop. In a year, she's gone
from not being a mother

408
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:56,041
to being a mother
of a 9 year old and 3 babies.

409
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:58,041
That would be a nightmare
for a normal woman,

410
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,250
and she's Charlotte.
I know.

411
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,291
She'll come around.

412
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:05,208
There's a reason they give us
nine months, you know?

413
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,041
...As tragedy struck
tonight in west L.A.

414
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:13,458
43-year-old Kevin glanville
left a super bowl party early

415
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,041
and was shot and killed

416
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,041
outside the four-star pierro's
on pico boulevard.

417
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,458
Police officers believe
the motive was robbery.

418
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,458
At this point,
there are no suspects,

419
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,291
but the search continues
for any witnesses.

420
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,291
Glanville is survived
by his wife Elyse

421
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,291
and their two children,
Brady and Lena,

422
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:30,041
ages 7 and 4.

423
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:38,750
You know, there's so much
to take care of--

424
00:16:38,792 --> 00:16:41,333
the bills, the insurance.

425
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,375
I forgot to cancel
his BlackBerry,

426
00:16:44,417 --> 00:16:45,625
and about a week ago,

427
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:47,750
there was a call from a number
I didn't recognize,

428
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:50,208
so I called back.

429
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,041
She said she loved him.

430
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:57,208
My husband.

431
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:01,041
Two years he'd been seeing her.

432
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:05,375
I'm mourning his loss,

433
00:17:05,417 --> 00:17:07,041
but I hate him.

434
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:11,041
My husband is in the ground,

435
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:13,166
covered in dirt,

436
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:15,959
and...

437
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,250
I hate him.

438
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:27,208
Chai tea latte.

439
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,166
Aw. You always remember.

440
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,625
Thank you.

441
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:33,792
You know, you--you don't
have to do this now.

442
00:17:33,834 --> 00:17:35,792
No point in putting it off.

443
00:17:35,834 --> 00:17:37,667
Wonder what saw palmetto is.

444
00:17:37,709 --> 00:17:38,917
Damned if I know.

445
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:40,625
I was talking to one
of Pete's patients earlier.

446
00:17:40,667 --> 00:17:43,792
She asked me what she should do
if she runs out of milk thistle.

447
00:17:43,834 --> 00:17:45,041
What did you tell her?

448
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:47,709
Try whole foods.

449
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,458
You holding up okay?

450
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,500
You know what they say about
grief having five stages?

451
00:17:51,542 --> 00:17:53,917
There's way more.

452
00:17:53,959 --> 00:17:55,500
How about you?

453
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:57,375
I'm a...

454
00:17:57,417 --> 00:17:59,458
Cheater.

455
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,000
You cheated on Jake?

456
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:04,041
Mm. Not physically,
but emotionally.

457
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,417
Who's the lucky guy?

458
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,500
Mark Sloan.

459
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:09,041
I mean, we hadn't spoken
in months,

460
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:11,500
but I can't--
I can't stop crying,

461
00:18:11,542 --> 00:18:13,250
you know, and that feels like
cheating on Jake.

462
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,458
Addison, there is room
to mourn somebody you loved

463
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,041
and still be in love
with somebody else.

464
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:20,041
Yeah, well, it feels very
crowded inside of me right now.

465
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,625
Well, maybe talking to Jake
would help.

466
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,458
I have a history, Violet,

467
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,625
and not just I dated some guys
and made some mistakes.

468
00:18:25,667 --> 00:18:27,834
I mean, I have a history.

469
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,750
Jake doesn't know
a lot of things,

470
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:32,041
and i-i-i--
if open that door, then--

471
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,291
Addison, anyone you enter
into a relationship with

472
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,333
is gonna have a history.

473
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,041
You are your past.

474
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,291
Own it.

475
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:45,583
Hey, sexy.

476
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:50,750
That's Dr. Bennett to you.

477
00:18:50,792 --> 00:18:52,667
You want to grab food
tonight?

478
00:18:52,709 --> 00:18:54,959
Oh, I can't tonight.
I'm sorry.

479
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Oh.

480
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,333
Oh? What, oh?

481
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:00,667
It's your night with
the other women in the harem.

482
00:19:00,709 --> 00:19:02,041
What?

483
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,583
Well, it's not like I really
know anything about you.

484
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,542
Oh, come on, Stephanie.

485
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,750
So it's just a date
with an old flame then?

486
00:19:09,709 --> 00:19:11,750
You know what? Yeah,
that's exactly what it is.

487
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,709
Sam, that was a joke.

488
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,792
Not a good one, obviously.

489
00:19:15,834 --> 00:19:17,333
Yeah, right.

490
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,041
Come on. I was kidding.

491
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:20,542
All right, I gotta
get back to the office.

492
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,583
I have to say,

493
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:27,041
since, uh, telling you
about what happened,

494
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,583
I'm just starting
to feel better.

495
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,542
I mean, I know what I did
was wrong,

496
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:35,417
but just saying it out loud,
I feel so...

497
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:36,834
Relieved.

498
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,041
I mean, if I'd known
that could've happened,

499
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,417
I would've brought it up
much sooner.

500
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:43,750
Dr. Turner?

501
00:19:43,792 --> 00:19:45,625
Are you all right?

502
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:46,750
Yeah.

503
00:19:46,792 --> 00:19:48,917
It's...

504
00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:51,625
I'm--i'm--I'm just not feeling
that well all of a sudden.

505
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:52,625
Do you mind if we cut
our session short?

506
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:55,000
Yeah. Um, could I make
an appointment

507
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:56,542
for the same time tomorrow?
Sure.

508
00:19:56,583 --> 00:20:00,041
I just feel like I'm really
starting to get somewhere.

509
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,000
I-I hope you feel better.

510
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,000
You don't belong
back at work yet.

511
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,458
You lost your husband.

512
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,542
You can't achieve closure with
the problems in your marriage,

513
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:14,041
so instead, you go digging
around in your patient's past.

514
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,792
Well, maybe knowing the truth
could bring him closure.

515
00:20:15,834 --> 00:20:18,041
Maybe I should tell him.
It's not your place,
and if you do tell him,

516
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,041
he's gonna have to live with
the fact that he's a murderer

517
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,667
for the rest of his life.
Well,
he always was a murderer.

518
00:20:21,709 --> 00:20:23,166
His ignorance
didn't change that.

519
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:24,625
The only difference is,
if he knows for sure,

520
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:26,834
maybe he could do something
about it.

521
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,041
You came to me
because you screwed up.

522
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,792
I know!

523
00:20:31,834 --> 00:20:34,041
I know.
I did the wrong thing,

524
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,083
and now I need you
to help me to fix it.

525
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:39,375
I--if I don't tell him,
I don't know what to say.

526
00:20:39,417 --> 00:20:42,041
What do I say?
Help me, Sheldon.

527
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,041
I know you're right.
I know.

he is screwed.

530

533

Refer him to another therapist.

534

You have to stop
seeing this patient,

535
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,750

Violet.

536
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,625
Two doctors say
she's brain-dead,

537

a third says, "miracles happen.
Don't give up."

538

what the percentage is.

539

It's small. Miniscule, even.

540
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,125
But if I take her off
life support,

541
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:33,125
what if she's
in that small percentage?

542
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,792
What if the next day,
she would've opened her eyes?

543
00:21:35,834 --> 00:21:37,500
You hear about it all the time.

544
00:21:37,542 --> 00:21:39,375
People just wake up.

545
00:21:39,417 --> 00:21:41,667
And she's such a fighter.

546
00:21:41,709 --> 00:21:45,125
We went on this cleanse once
for three weeks.

547
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:46,792
Day two, she comes home

548
00:21:46,834 --> 00:21:49,709
and catches me scarfing down
a box of cookies.

549
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,792
I mean, literally inhaling them.

550
00:21:52,834 --> 00:21:54,542
I was so done.

551
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:56,667
But she saw it through.

552
00:21:56,709 --> 00:22:02,041
She never gives up on anything,

553
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:04,917
so how can I give up on her?

554
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,166
There you are.

555
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:20,834
Just listening to the sounds
of the real ocean

556
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:23,709

from the baby monitor.

Yeah, but you clearly didn't
want to talk about him.

Okay.

maybe you should do
this one differently.

705
00:29:38,959 --> 00:29:40,041
Are you doing it differently?

706
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:41,250
I'm--

707
00:29:45,959 --> 00:29:47,458
all right.

708
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:55,542
Charlotte.

709
00:29:55,583 --> 00:29:57,542
Charlotte.

710
00:29:57,583 --> 00:29:59,041
What? What?

711
00:29:59,083 --> 00:30:00,250
What are you doing here?

712
00:30:00,291 --> 00:30:02,583
No, I get to ask the questions
in this particular situation.

713
00:30:02,625 --> 00:30:04,583
My pregnant wife
doesn't come home?

714
00:30:04,625 --> 00:30:06,291
Oh, you knew I was working.

715
00:30:06,333 --> 00:30:08,875
Yes, I did, which is why
when you didn't answer my texts,

716
00:30:08,917 --> 00:30:10,792
I called the admit desk
every hour

717
00:30:10,834 --> 00:30:12,166
to make sure
someone had seen you alive.

718
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:15,083
Only half an hour ago,
nobody could find you,

719
00:30:15,125 --> 00:30:18,125
so I made them search,
and then I ran over here,

720
00:30:18,166 --> 00:30:20,000
wondering if you were dead.

721
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:21,583
What? What is it?

722
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:24,041
It's my feet. It's just
these damn shoes. I'm fine.

723
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:26,208
You're not fine. Charlotte!

724
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:28,333
You are not fine.

725
00:30:28,375 --> 00:30:30,041
Do you know that Pete
went running,

726
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:31,291
and no one could find him,
and he was dead,

727
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:33,041
that you were here
late one night

728
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:35,208
and somebody attacked you
in your own office?

729
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,208
And I'm supposed to
protect you.

730
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:40,375
I'm supposed to protect
our children. That is my job.

731
00:30:40,417 --> 00:30:43,083
And I can't do it
if you're not gonna let me.

732
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:46,041
You are not fine,

733
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:47,834
so I'm not fine.

734
00:30:53,834 --> 00:30:57,333
Okay, look, I know you don't
want to talk about this anymore,

735
00:30:57,375 --> 00:30:59,125
and if you don't want to get
the biopsy done here,

736
00:30:59,166 --> 00:31:00,458
there are other doctors
I can refer you to.

737
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,583
My father had
prostate cancer.

738
00:31:04,792 --> 00:31:07,125
Yeah, I know.
Your, uh,

739
00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:09,000
your family history
was one of the reasons

740
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:10,792
why I-I ran the test.

741
00:31:10,834 --> 00:31:12,041
But that doesn't
necessarily--

742
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:13,625
my father had
prostate cancer.

743
00:31:13,667 --> 00:31:16,041
I mean, that's not what
he died from. It changed him.

744
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:17,792
From the moment
he was diagnosed,

745
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:20,041
my father was
a dead man walking.

746
00:31:20,083 --> 00:31:22,250
And he mourned his death
for years.

747
00:31:22,291 --> 00:31:24,041
He gave up.

748
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:27,166
It was the most depressing thing
I'd ever seen, and...

749
00:31:27,208 --> 00:31:28,375
I don't want that
to happen to me.

750
00:31:28,417 --> 00:31:30,583
It won't.
You don't know that.

751
00:31:30,625 --> 00:31:32,250
I do know that.
No, you don't.

752
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:36,208
I guess I never saw it before.

753
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:38,583
I mean, Ricky's doing great.

754
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:39,875
I'm doing great.

755
00:31:39,917 --> 00:31:42,083
I went to computer school,
changed my life.

756
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:46,041
It's different. I mean, I'm not
the same guy I was before.

757
00:31:46,083 --> 00:31:49,250
But you're obviously still
carrying around what you did.

758
00:31:49,291 --> 00:31:52,208
Sure, but, you know, i'm
starting to feel so much better.

759
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:54,709
Well, it's a little soon
for that. Don't you think?

760
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,208
But you said that--

761
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,291
I mean, have you ever really

762
00:31:57,333 --> 00:31:59,291
thought about
the man that you shot?

763
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:01,333
What if he had a family?

764
00:32:01,375 --> 00:32:03,041
What if he had a son?

765
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:05,709
A son who doesn't understand
why his father left

766
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,250
and is never coming home.

767
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:10,917
You may have ruined a family,
Adam.

768
00:32:10,959 --> 00:32:13,208
What kind of person can walk
around with that for ten years

769
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:16,834
and feel okay?

770
00:32:16,875 --> 00:32:19,291
Oh, god. I'm sorry.

771
00:32:21,333 --> 00:32:23,291
Oh, god. I'm so sorry.

772
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,834
I'm so sorry, Adam.
I'm so sorry.

773
00:32:33,875 --> 00:32:35,625
That was unprofessional.
I apologize.

774
00:32:35,667 --> 00:32:37,041
No. No.
No, you were right.

775
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:38,917
You're right.
No, I wasn't. I wasn't.

776
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:40,792
If I'm a murderer,
I gotta know.

777
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:42,250
No, you don't have to.

778
00:32:42,291 --> 00:32:45,125
There is a reason that
you never tried to find out.

779
00:32:45,166 --> 00:32:47,667
Okay? This is my stuff.
I'm going through something,

780
00:32:47,709 --> 00:32:49,458
and i--and I lost sight of...

781
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,458
I let my needs
blend with yours,

782
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,166
and--and that was wrong.

783
00:32:53,208 --> 00:32:55,166
I was wrong.

784
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:57,125
Adam, I-I need you to see
a new therapist.

785
00:32:57,166 --> 00:32:58,917
What?

786
00:32:58,959 --> 00:33:01,041
I-I-I will--I'll give you some
names, people I recommend,

787
00:33:01,083 --> 00:33:03,583
but I cannot see you anymore.
I'm not helping you.

788
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:05,041
Nobody can help me.

789
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:07,917
If I killed him,
I mean, what do I do?

790
00:33:07,959 --> 00:33:09,291
What can I do?

791
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:10,750
You are already doing it.

792
00:33:10,792 --> 00:33:14,166
You are living your life
differently, better.

793
00:33:14,208 --> 00:33:16,041
You are living your amends,

794
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:18,208
being a better person,

795
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:21,041
and that will set you free.

796
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:29,083
Last month...

797
00:33:29,125 --> 00:33:31,041
Alice passed.

798
00:33:32,875 --> 00:33:34,625
She was my whole world.

799
00:33:34,667 --> 00:33:36,750
I didn't know what to do.

800
00:33:36,792 --> 00:33:39,041
For 50 years,
this woman took care of me,

801
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:41,375
and then suddenly...

802
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:47,333
Anyway, I, uh...

803
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:48,625
I called Jimmy,

804
00:33:48,667 --> 00:33:53,125
and the first thing
he said to me was...

805
00:33:53,166 --> 00:33:55,041
"I really love you, dad,

806
00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:57,959
and I'll be there tonight."

807
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,333
He hadn't said he loved me
since he was a little boy.

808
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:04,667
And over the past month,
we've gotten closer.

809
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,208
I mean, he has become

810
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:10,750
a phenomenal young man.

811
00:34:10,792 --> 00:34:14,792
I know I'm supposed to be
grieving, but, uh...

812
00:34:14,834 --> 00:34:16,542
I got my son back.

813
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:19,000
And maybe I shouldn't say it,
but...

814
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:22,458
I'm happy.

815
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,041
I'm happy.

816
00:34:32,834 --> 00:34:34,792
Hey.

817
00:34:34,834 --> 00:34:36,041
I brought this for you.

818
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:38,625
You, uh, you drink tea,
not coffee, right?

819
00:34:38,667 --> 00:34:40,000
Yeah. Thanks.

820
00:34:40,041 --> 00:34:42,959
How are you?
Are you, uh, you okay?

821
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:47,250
Hey.

822
00:34:47,291 --> 00:34:48,834
What are you,
uh, what are you doing here?

823
00:34:48,875 --> 00:34:50,792
What am I doing
here? What are you doing here?

824
00:34:50,834 --> 00:34:52,458
I told you I needed
to change times.
And I told you I couldn't.

825
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,709
This is
supposed to be my time.

826
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:55,041
Hello? Guys?

827
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:56,959
What's going on here?

828
00:35:02,792 --> 00:35:05,709
I believe I owe you this

829
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:09,041
for the babysitting club
that you organized.

830
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:10,083
What are you talking about?

831
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:11,959
Sam and Jake outed you.

832
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,458
I have to admit,
I thought it was a little odd

833
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,750
that everyone
kept bringing me tea.

834
00:35:14,792 --> 00:35:16,959
I said, "bring her tea
or something."

835
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,750
I did not think
they would be so literal.

836
00:35:18,792 --> 00:35:20,625
Sheldon brought me iced tea.

837
00:35:20,667 --> 00:35:23,041
Unfortunately, I hate iced tea.

838
00:35:23,083 --> 00:35:24,000
Violet.

839
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:29,875
In the beginning,
everyone's there.

840
00:35:29,917 --> 00:35:31,917
But people forget.

841
00:35:31,959 --> 00:35:34,083
You know, life goes on,

842
00:35:34,125 --> 00:35:35,750
or it goes on
for everyone else

843
00:35:35,792 --> 00:35:37,917
even if it's not going on
for you.

844
00:35:39,375 --> 00:35:40,709
I just wanted to make sure
that--

845
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,417
thank you.

846
00:36:10,041 --> 00:36:11,834
I miss Pete.

847
00:36:11,875 --> 00:36:15,750
I know.

848
00:36:15,792 --> 00:36:19,583
Everything is changing.

849
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:21,000
I know.

850
00:36:23,875 --> 00:36:26,959
So I hired
a new E.R. doc today.

851
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,709
Really?

852
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:31,041
And in an effort

853
00:36:31,083 --> 00:36:34,667
to be slightly less...

854
00:36:34,709 --> 00:36:35,875
Difficult,
here's the deal--

855
00:36:35,917 --> 00:36:40,000
I will allow you to talk
to my belly once--

856
00:36:40,041 --> 00:36:42,959
once a day.

857
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Okay?

858
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:49,375
Don't be weird.
I won't.

859
00:36:49,417 --> 00:36:51,667
And don't massage the belly
or rub it or kiss it

860
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,458
like I'm some kind of host
or something.

861
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,792
Okay.

862
00:36:54,834 --> 00:36:56,458
I swear to god,
if you sing, i--
Charlotte.

863
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:06,000
Hi.

864
00:37:06,041 --> 00:37:07,792
I cannot wait
to meet you guys.

865
00:37:07,834 --> 00:37:11,792
Know that your dad will always
be there for you no matter what

866
00:37:11,834 --> 00:37:16,041
and please know you will always,
always, always be loved.

867
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:20,250
I said no kissing.

868
00:37:20,291 --> 00:37:21,625
All right, I'm here.

869
00:37:21,667 --> 00:37:23,709
What's so important that you had
to see me in person?

870
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,083
You want a drink?

871
00:37:25,125 --> 00:37:27,500
No. I want to know why
you were such an ass yesterday.

872
00:37:27,542 --> 00:37:28,500
I'm sorry.

873
00:37:28,542 --> 00:37:30,083
I'm sorry.

874
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:31,709
All right?

875
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,208
My relationships--
I've--I've screwed them all up.

876
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:37,000
You know, I got in my own way,
and, you know,

877
00:37:37,041 --> 00:37:38,667
I don't want to be the guy
that you're talking about

878
00:37:38,709 --> 00:37:40,166
when you're in bed
