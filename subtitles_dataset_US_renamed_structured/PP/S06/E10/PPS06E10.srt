♪ Ohhh ohhh ohhh ♪

2
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:08,709
Damn it.

3
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:19,208
Even though I won't be back
in my office until I give birth,

4
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,583
I'm still running things here.

5
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:22,208
So y'all need to come up
with five ways

6
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,208
to improve
the patient experience.

7
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,667
'Cause I'm here to tell you,
it sucks.

8
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:28,041
That's it.

9
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:34,333
Did Addison say this is okay?

10
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:37,333
She said I had to say in this
position for 48 hours straight.

11
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:39,250
Well, this is not bed rest.

12
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:41,709
This is running a hospital
from a bed.

13
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,291
Potato. Po-tah-to.

14
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:44,709
How's my girl?

15
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,875
This is an hour ago.

16
00:01:47,917 --> 00:01:49,750
She's so tiny.

17
00:01:49,792 --> 00:01:51,917
Small but mighty,
like her mama.

18
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:54,959
I think she's getting tired
of "baby king-Freedman"

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,542
on the side
of her Incubator.

20
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,208
She tell you that?
Mm-hmm.

21
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,041
I can't name her
until I meet her.

22
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:02,458
You'll meet her soon.
I promise.

23
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,041
I still like mathilda.

24
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,709
You're joking, right?

25
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,333
I'm gonna put it
on the board.

26
00:02:10,834 --> 00:02:12,250
Don't worry, baby.

27
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:16,000
He'll call you mathilda
over my cold dead body.

28
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,542
I wonder if there's asbestos
under there.

29
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:22,083
Not good for the babies

30
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:23,792
or any other patient
in this place.

31
00:02:23,834 --> 00:02:26,083
Lord, I'd sell my soul
for arms long enough

32
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:27,667
to scratch those toes.

33
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:29,041
Boy, do I need a pedicure.

34
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,041
Charlotte, tell Sheldon
he has to Nick.

35
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,750
Nick the pedophile?

36
00:02:32,792 --> 00:02:33,959
His name is Nick Calhoun.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,750
Who cares what his name is?

38
00:02:35,792 --> 00:02:37,291
You're talking about a man
who took a 7 year old

39
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:39,417
from my hospital and did
god knows what to her.

40
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:41,333
That is the Nick
you're referring to, right?

41
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:42,959
Why on earth
would you visit him?

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,166
He called me, depressed. He'd
been in solitary confinement.

43
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:48,291
Excuse me, Dr. King.
I need to place another I.V.

44
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,583
Get on with it then.

45
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:51,041
I haven't decided
what to do.

46
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,041
Sheldon, he reached out to you.
You have to see him.

47
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,959
Well, now that he's been
incarcerated,

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,041
I'm not exactly sure
if he's still my patient

49
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,750
or what my obligation is--

50
00:02:58,792 --> 00:03:00,333
your only obligation is
to you.

51
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:01,625
Ow!

52
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:03,709
Have you done this before?

53
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,750
Stephanie.

54
00:03:04,792 --> 00:03:06,542
Go. Now.

55
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,375
And don't come back.

56
00:03:08,417 --> 00:03:10,583
Where the hell we'd find her?

57
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,625
She can't restart an I.V.
My 9 year old could do that.

58
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:14,834
You know, when I went
to see Katie,

59
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,834
I thought it was about her,
but really, it helped me.

60
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:19,041
How would visiting
Nick the pedophile help Sheldon?

61
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:20,792
Can you stop
calling him that?

62
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:22,041
The guy who took
Sarah Nelson?

63
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:24,875
Uh, sorry.
Not my conversation.

64
00:03:24,917 --> 00:03:26,834
Okay, look,
we are supposed to help.

65
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,667
I tried to help him
and I failed.

66
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,125
No, he failed.

67
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,750
Now he deserves to rot, alone.

68
00:03:32,792 --> 00:03:35,125
All done.

69
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,417
Do you know...

70
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:38,792
How is Sarah?

71
00:03:38,834 --> 00:03:40,542
Well, I recommended
a pediatric psychiatrist,

72
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,458
one who specializes
in sexual trauma.

73
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,417
Her parents are
cautiously optimistic.

74
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:46,625
I'm glad.

75
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:49,375
I'd like to castrate
Nick the pedophile,

76
00:03:49,417 --> 00:03:51,417
but I'm glad.

77
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:56,208
I like her.

78
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,291
Charlotte, I'm your doctor.

79
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,917
You have to listen to me.

80
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:02,709
To stop the labor,
we need to keep you supine

81
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:06,000
with your legs 30 degrees
over your head.

82
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,458
It's called trendelenburg.

83
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,417
Dr. Trendelenburg would've had

84
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,458
a lot of fans
during the Spanish inquisition.

85
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,041
Sadistic bastard.

86
00:04:21,542 --> 00:04:24,041
Yes, Dr. King?
It's bad enough
I'm living upside down.

87
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,959
Can't I get a decent pillow?

88
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:28,875
Tough day?

89
00:04:28,917 --> 00:04:30,041
Oh, what tipped you off?

90
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,667
Well, two weeks in bed is
a long time.

91
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:32,750
That's nothing compared

92
00:04:32,792 --> 00:04:34,041
to the six weeks
I still have coming.

93
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,834
How was school today, buddy?

94
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,041
It was fine.

95
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:39,417
Oh, can I go get a snack
before I start my homework?

96
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:40,959
Sure.

97
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:47,250
So much for today's
mother-son quality time.

98
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,041
He talking to you?

99
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:52,041
Uh, some. You know,
he's processing everything.

100
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,750
Ooh!

101
00:04:53,792 --> 00:04:55,291
Lucas loves
having him stay with us.

102
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:56,959
I'm afraid he's gonna demand
an older brother

103
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,041
after you guys come home.

104
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,458
Mm.

105
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,542
I can't get Cooper
to leave the nicu at night.

106
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,667
He looks like
death on toast.

107
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:07,750
You know,
not that I'm one to talk.

108
00:05:07,792 --> 00:05:10,291
Well, you're in a period
of transition,

109
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,792
and the stress related--

110
00:05:11,834 --> 00:05:13,542
stop.
I don't need a shrink.

111
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:14,750
Right.

112
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:15,917
I need for my daughter
to get stronger.

113
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,792
I need to keep these buns
in the oven.

114
00:05:17,834 --> 00:05:20,375
But I don't need a shrink.

115
00:05:20,417 --> 00:05:23,041
Of course, being able to pee
in the toilet would be nice.

116
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,333
Yeah. Well,
I can't help you there,

117
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:29,625
but if you ever find yourself
on the verge of losing it,

118
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:31,000
distraction works well.

119
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,375
Some people count to ten,

120
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:34,417
and taking really deep breaths
can help.

121
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:37,333
I know it sounds lame,
but it works.

122
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:40,166
These... are good, too.

123
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,542
Stress balls.

124
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,792
Squeeze them instead of
biting somebody's head off.

125
00:05:47,834 --> 00:05:50,000
It's almost as good
as talking to a shrink.

126
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,041
Can I get you anything else?

127
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,667
These are plenty.

128
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,875
Hang in there, mama.

129
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:21,667
How long does it take to find
a damn pillow?

130
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:27,041
She's got
her daddy's hands.

131
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,291
Pulse ox has improved.

132
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:29,709
Her heart rate is stable.

133
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,375
I'm gonna
teach you piano first

134
00:06:31,417 --> 00:06:33,041
because then guitar's
gonna be a snap.

135
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,834
She's triggering the vent
all by herself.

136
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,834
Wait. What?
She's breathing on her own?

137
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,041
Yeah. I can take her
off the ventilator now.

138
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,792
Is it--is it okay? Really?

139
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:42,625
Yeah. She's ready.
I mean, we don't have to
rush it, right?

140
00:06:42,667 --> 00:06:44,792
Oh, I'm done.

141
00:06:44,834 --> 00:06:46,208
Wow. Okay.
What's--what's next?

142
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,583
Kangaroo care.

143
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,166
I-I get to hold her?

144
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,041
Yeah. Unbutton your shirt
and sit down.

145
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,583
Whoa. It sounds so different
when Charlotte says it.

146
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:53,917
Skin-to-skin contact

147
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:56,041
has been known
to improve oxygen saturation,

148
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,500
respiration,

149
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:58,792
heart rate.

150
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:02,125
Here we go.

151
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,291
I'm ready.

152
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,458
Okay, sweetie.

153
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,083
There.
Okay.

154
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:09,834
Hi, sweetie.

155
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,250
Okay.

156
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:12,500
I'm daddy.

157
00:07:12,542 --> 00:07:13,834
You got her?

158
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,041
Yeah.

159
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,208
Oh, my goodness.

160
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,834
Oxygenation's improving.

161
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:22,750
Look at that.
It's like magic.

162
00:07:22,792 --> 00:07:23,959
Oh, here.

163
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,750
Okay.

164
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:29,208
Say, "hello, mama."

165
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,500
Hello, mama.

166
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,625
The ball is thrown away...

167
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:35,041
We've got
better news for you tomorrow.

168
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,750
What'd she do?

169
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,375
What, steal your man?
Run over your dog?

170
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:44,458
Damn, girl.

171
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,125
You fight dirty.

172
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,917
No hair pulling?

173
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,750
- Huh.
- Is that your baby daddy?!

174
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:52,583
Huh.

175
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:55,583
So this is what it feels like
when your brain cells die.

176
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,709
Oh, hell, no.
Oh, no, you didn't!

177
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,458
Oh.

178
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:14,166
You only have to
press it once.

179
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,417
What's going on out there?

180
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:18,583
Work, which I should
be getting back to.

181
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,750
Hey, do you like your job?

182
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,542
Is this a trick question?

183
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,583
No.
Then yes.

184
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,625
I mean, I know some people
think that nurses are

185
00:08:26,667 --> 00:08:29,750
just frustrated doctors,
but I like being more hands-on.

186
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:31,125
Then it's your lucky day.

187
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,917
I'm making you
my private nurse.

188
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:35,709
No one else here knows their ass
from a hole in the ground.

189
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,375
I'm the floor manager,
Dr. King.

190
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:38,709
I can't cater
to just one patient.

191
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,750
You can now.

192
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:41,583
Figure it out.

193
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,417
Off the vent.
Oh, my god.

194
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:47,583
Hi.
Hi.

195
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:48,834
Let's see.

196
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,667
I haven't seen you
around here much.

197
00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:51,542
I-I've been busy.

198
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,041
Okay. I'll, uh...

199
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,041
Okay. Take care. Yeah.
Yeah.

200
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:03,583
Okay, uh, I'm gonna...

201
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,000
Sam, thank you so much.
Yep.

202
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,625
You should go, too, Coop.
Home.
Mm.

203
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:08,834
She'll be okay without you
for one night.

204
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:12,208
I'll go get some clothes,
I guess.

205
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,709
Damn it.

206
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,208
Contraction.

207
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,834
I think it was, um,
just the one.

208
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,375
No, you've been having
contractions

209
00:09:29,417 --> 00:09:31,166
every three minutes.
That was just pressure.

210
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,458
I don't think
it's actually a contraction.
Okay.

211
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,417
Look, we've got you
on tocolytics

212
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:36,792
and we've put you
in trendelenburg.

213
00:09:36,834 --> 00:09:39,291
I mean, we could--we could add
a magnesium drip.

214
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,709
It's not standard treatment
anymore, but it's worth a try.

215
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,041
It will provide
neural protection

216
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,583
and it might stop
the contractions.

217
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,625
Might? You said 48 hours.

218
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:49,250
That's all I had to go
without a contraction

219
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,709
to be able to lay flat.

220
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,875
That was my big prize--
not standing up,

221
00:09:52,917 --> 00:09:55,625
not getting to use
the actual toilet,

222
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:57,542
not seeing my baby.

223
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,625
Laying flat...

224
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:02,041
I was living for that.

225
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,625
I only needed 16 more hours.

226
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:10,750
I did not sign up for this.

227
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,500
Okay.

228
00:10:47,542 --> 00:10:48,709
Looks like good news.

229
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,500
This is all just a bad dream,

230
00:10:50,542 --> 00:10:52,542
and I'll be home for Christmas
with three healthy babies?

231
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:57,583
No, but you have stopped having
contractions for two days,

232
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,792
so you get to lie flat.

233
00:10:59,834 --> 00:11:00,875
Ohh, great.

234
00:11:00,917 --> 00:11:03,583
How's that feel?

235
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:06,417
Ah. Still not the angle I want
to see Christmas from.

236
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:07,500
Mm.

237
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,083
It was gonna be great.

238
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,709
I was gonna sit my fat ass
on the couch

239
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,917
with three babies cooking
in my enormous belly...

240
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,750
While I drank
virgin eggnog.

241
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:18,500
I'm sorry, Charlotte.

242
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:20,083
I am gonna keep you
on the magnesium drip

243
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,291
because it seems to be helping,
but if you have

244
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:25,125
any other contractions, I gotta
put you back on trendelenburg.

245
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,041
You're lurking.
What do you want?

246
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,834
I'm here
on behalf of the board.

247
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,375
Uh, we thought maybe,

248
00:11:34,417 --> 00:11:36,333
um, given your condition,
maybe--

249
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:37,750
spit it out, Lisa.

250
00:11:37,792 --> 00:11:40,041
How do you feel about
passing along

251
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,667
some of
your chief of staff duties,

252
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:44,041
just
for the foreseeable future?

253
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,041
I have compiled a list
of candidates here.

254
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,166
Have you?

255
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:50,041
Well, thanks,
but there's no need.

256
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:52,625
Uh, well, the board is just
thinking of your health.

257
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:54,583
Really?
That's what they were thinking

258
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:57,417
when they sent a mid-level
human resources manager

259
00:11:57,458 --> 00:12:00,041
to relieve me of my duties?

260
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:04,000
You want to know what
the scariest thing in the world

261
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:06,041
is to an H.R. department?
A pregnant woman.

262
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,709
Juries love pregnant women.

263
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,041
They especially love
when we have twins,

264
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:12,250
and oh, my,
do they adore triplets.

265
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,458
You see, right now,
it seems to me like

266
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,667
my employers are trying
to fire a pregnant woman,

267
00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:19,709
and if that's the case,
I will sue you and them

268
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,041
and the whole hospital.

269
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,041
And the only one
who will still be here

270
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,834
in the foreseeable future

271
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:28,667
is a very rich me.

272
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:46,875
You're sitting at the bar,
alone.

273
00:12:46,917 --> 00:12:48,917
I sidle up next to you,

274
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,041
order a Martini.

275
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:54,041
I'm in thigh-high black boots

276
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:57,959
and a silk slip
that's not quite

277
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,041
long enough to be decent.

278
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,083
Lips?

279
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,458
Cherry red.

280
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,709
Oh, I love this one.

281
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,000
Mm, you never heard
this one.

282
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,625
We don't know each other.

283
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:08,625
We don't?

284
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:09,709
Nope.

285
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,041
I touch your hand,

286
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,083
ask you for a light.

287
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,583
But I drop my cigarette,
and when

288
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,041
I lean over to get it,

289
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:22,291
the slip rides up
just enough for you to see

290
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,750
that I am not wearing

291
00:13:24,792 --> 00:13:26,583
any--
oh, you're killing me.

292
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,667
What if my wife catches us?

293
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,959
Well, is she hot?
Maybe we can all--

294
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,542
oh, I gotta go.
Wait. What?

295
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,083
Wait. Wait. Wait. No, I h--

296
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,250
i--you can't leave me hanging
like this.

297
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,875
Female orgasms bring on
uterine contractions.

298
00:13:40,917 --> 00:13:42,792
No.
You want two more preemies?

299
00:13:42,834 --> 00:13:45,041
Oh, that's not true.
Please tell me that's not true.

300
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,041
Well, if I can't finish,
neither can you.

301
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,125
I love you.

302
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,041
I love you.

303
00:13:56,792 --> 00:13:59,583
Drip.

304
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,750
Drip.

305
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:03,041
Drip.

306
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,041
Where the hell's that idiot
from engineering?

307
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,792
I put in a request to fix
the faucet yesterday

308
00:14:07,834 --> 00:14:09,333
and the day before.

309
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:10,709
He's fired.

310
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,333
When I get out of here,
everyone's fired.

311
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,333
Oh, a pillow can muffle
a gunshot,

312
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,000
but not that damn drip?

313
00:14:25,792 --> 00:14:28,959
8:07. Here she comes.

314
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,750
Look... at... her.

315
00:14:31,792 --> 00:14:34,000
You just know
her name's Ashley.

316
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,542
Enjoy those perky boobs
while you can, missy.

317
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,041
Before you know it,
you'll need a push-up bra

318
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,834
to keep those girls
at attention.

319
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,250
Ow!

320
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:42,750
Oh.

321
00:14:42,792 --> 00:14:43,834
No.

322
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,792
That's not a contraction.

323
00:14:45,834 --> 00:14:48,000
Gas. That's all.

324
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,083
Just gas.

325
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:53,792
Who'd they bribe to escape this
hellhole with a healthy baby?

326
00:14:53,834 --> 00:14:55,041
Ow!

327
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:58,041
Son of a bitch,
that felt like a contraction.

328
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,875
No. Don't go there.

329
00:14:59,917 --> 00:15:02,208
It's probably just--ah! Oh.

330
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,875
Okay.

331
00:15:03,917 --> 00:15:06,208
That's four. This is bad.

332
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,709
Very bad.

333
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,792
If this keeps up, Addison'll
put me back upside down,

334
00:15:10,834 --> 00:15:12,834
and candy striper Ashley
will steal my husband,

335
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,667
and the happy family will take
Mason and my baby,

336
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:17,667
and the faucet
will just keep dripping.

337
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,959
Addison doesn't have to know.

338
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,750
That should do it.

339
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,625
Hey.

340
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:44,875
Come give me a hug.

341
00:15:46,667 --> 00:15:48,250
Mm.

342
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,709
Mm.

343
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,458
What happened to your shirt?

344
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,375
I ripped it during recess.

345
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,625
Is that a bite Mark?

346
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:01,875
Who did this to you?

347
00:16:01,917 --> 00:16:03,542
Just this kid at school.
Okay?

348
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,875
He's bigger than me,
beat me up.

349
00:16:05,917 --> 00:16:07,000
Well, you all right?
Does it hurt?

350
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:08,041
I'm fine.

351
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:11,583
What's his name?

352
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,041
Neal segal.

353
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:17,083
Go ask Stephanie
to clean that up. Okay?

354
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,083
Think you can beat up
on my kid?

355
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:25,458
Think again, Neal segal.

356
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,750
Let's just find your parents.

357
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:36,583
What's wrong?

358
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,417
Get this tray away from me.

359
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:39,792
The only thing worse
than trying to get it down

360
00:16:39,834 --> 00:16:41,709
is waiting for it
to come back up.

361
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,041
I can't wait to see

362
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,125
the Christmas buffet
you put out.

363
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:46,709
Ugh. How do people
eat this stuff?

364
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,333
Yeah. Too bad one of us
doesn't have control

365
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,375
over the quality of food
in this place.

366
00:16:50,417 --> 00:16:52,625
Hey. How you feeling?
Steph.

367
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:54,000
Hi.

368
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,792
Same as I was when you
asked me an hour ago.

369
00:16:55,834 --> 00:16:58,041
This one giving you
a hard time?

370
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,750
Oh, it's nothing
I can't handle.

371
00:16:59,792 --> 00:17:02,125
Yeah, well, at least you can
stick her with needles.

372
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:10,041
Oh, needles.

373
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,750
Okay. Well, I'll let you
get your rest.

374
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:18,041
Tell me something--

375
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,750
you still into Sam?

376
00:17:19,792 --> 00:17:21,792
That's none
of your damn business.

377
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:23,041
Well, the least you can do is
entertain me.

378
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,750
No, I may be
your Beck-and-call girl,

379
00:17:24,792 --> 00:17:26,041
but I'm not
your social director,

380
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,166
and I definitely
don't have to talk to you

381
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,417
about my personal life.

382
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:29,959
So you are still into Sam.

383
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,166
Oh.

384
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:36,000
Your I.V. Bag emptied faster
than I expected.

385
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,375
Really?

386
00:17:37,417 --> 00:17:40,000
Yeah. At the flow rate I set,
there should be plenty left.

387
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:41,875
You gonna give Sam
another chance?

388
00:17:47,709 --> 00:17:50,041
Your brother wants to have
a party when you come home,

389
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,625
with balloons and streamers

390
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:54,458
and a clown.

391
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,166
Although honestly,
clowns are a little creepy.

392
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,917
If you need a break,
I'm here.

393
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:02,667
No, I'm good. Thanks.

394
00:18:02,709 --> 00:18:05,625
Her pulse ox is
a little lower than normal.

395
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,375
On these little ones,
it can vary quite a bit.

396
00:18:08,417 --> 00:18:11,291
Yeah. But her heart rate's
been creeping up.

397
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:14,041
I don't think you have
anything to worry about.

398
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:17,041
Doctor parents are always
a little overanxious.

399
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,875
Mm.

400
00:18:18,917 --> 00:18:22,417
She's got rhinorrhea

401
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:24,625
and intercostal muscle
retractions when she breathes.

402
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:26,083
I'll make a note
in her chart.

403
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,625
No, she needs a chest X-ray,
and she needs arterial blood gas

404
00:18:28,667 --> 00:18:30,834
and nasal washings.
I will let
the attending know--

405
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,458
okay, you're not listening
to me.

406
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,625
I'm not waiting
for the attending.

407
00:18:33,667 --> 00:18:34,917
I'm a doctor, I'm her father,

408
00:18:34,959 --> 00:18:36,834
and I'm telling you
to go get tests.

409
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,875
You go get
the damn tests. Now.

410
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,250
...Alabama
versus Tennessee.

411
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,709
Whoo! First down, bama.

412
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,417
Roll tide's gonna stampede
all over rocky top.

413
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,375
Alabama's the crimson tide,

414
00:19:19,417 --> 00:19:20,625
but their mascot's
an elephant.

415
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:21,917
Make any sense to you?

416
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:24,041
That's what volunteer fans
always latch on to

417
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,417
when they're getting
their butts kicked.

418
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,166
Maybe you guys should
just turn it over now.

419
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,792
Too much excitement might not
be good for the babies.

420
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:32,333
These babies are fine. They got
southern blood in their veins.

421
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,500
The first one's
off the ventilator.

422
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:37,041
That's great news,
Charlotte.

423
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,208
So you've been adjusting
your magnesium drip?

424
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,208
Yes, I have,

425
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,000
and it stopped the contractions.

426
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,375
And you know how I knew
that would happen?

427
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:46,834
Because I'm a doctor
and the chief of staff.

428
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,041
No, now you are a patient,
Charlotte.

429
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,041
You can't self-medicate,
Charlotte. It's dangerous.

430
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,458
It's Addison's fault.

431
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,041
She's the one who left an addict
with access to drugs.

432
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:58,041
Magnesium is not a narcotic.
Nice try.

433
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,000
But since you clearly
cannot be trusted...

434
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,458
I am locking the pump.

435
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,041
Tennessee's defense

436
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,041
is gonna have to tighten up
against the pass

437
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:09,792
or this could be
a long game.

438
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,959
I already suspect the worst.
Is it the worst?

439
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,375
Chest x-rays show an infiltrate
on her lungs.

440
00:20:16,417 --> 00:20:18,041
Yeah. The labs?

441
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,750
R.s.v. Pneumonia.

442
00:20:19,792 --> 00:20:22,041
We're gonna have to put her
back on the ventilator.

443
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,125
I so wanted to be wrong.

444
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,417
All right,
I can't tell Charlotte.

445
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,041
She's already in hell.

446
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,041
There's no treatment
for this virus,

447
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:31,083
and w-with a baby so small...

448
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,083
We're not--
with a compromised immune
system. She could just--

449
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:33,667
we're not there yet.

450
00:20:33,709 --> 00:20:35,083
All right, we'll put her
back on the ventilator.

451
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:37,083
We'll watch her.

452
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,875
We're not there yet.

453
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:47,458
Are you all right?

454
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,000
Why did you tattle
to Addison?

455
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,667
That's--that's why
you called me in?

456
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,208
'Cause I thought you actually
needed something.

457
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,500
I do. I need to know
why you ratted me out

458
00:20:56,542 --> 00:20:58,041
about the magnesium drip.

459
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,417
'Cause it was
for your own good.

460
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,750
I'm thirsty.
I need some water.

461
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,834
What are you, 5?

462
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:29,625
It's not my job to jump
whenever you're bored.

463
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:31,583
Get me another nurse.
No.

464
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:34,041
You're fired.
No, I'm not.

465
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:36,125
You are definitely fired.

466
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:38,125
Oh, yeah?
You kick me to the curb,

467
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,125
there'll be nobody else
to take care of you.

468
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,041
Every other nurse out there
would sooner quit

469
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,709
than walk in this room.
Okay?

470
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,041
I get that you're uncomfortable,
I get that you're scared,

471
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:48,000
but you're not the first woman
to have a high-risk pregnancy,

472
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:49,750
so there is no need for you

473
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:51,917
to be such a monumental
pain in the ass

474
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:53,250
and make it impossible

475
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,041
for anybody
to feel compassion for you.

476
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:58,667
Now I am trying my very best
not to smother you with a pillow

477
00:21:58,709 --> 00:22:00,041
every time I walk
in this room,

478
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,041
but you are seriously
trying my Patience.

479
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,583
So please,

480
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:06,333
for your health, for the health
of your unborn children,

481
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,792
do not even think about pressing
that call button again

482
00:22:08,834 --> 00:22:11,458
unless you're in labor
or you're dying.

483
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:20,000
I completely agree.

484
00:22:21,417 --> 00:22:22,583
Yes.

485
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:26,041
I assure you,
it's under control.

486
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:28,542
What's wrong?

487
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,500
If you were paying attention
to our son,

488
00:22:31,542 --> 00:22:34,041
you might've noticed
the bite Mark on his arm.

489
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:35,000
Somebody bit him?

490
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:37,542
Is he okay? What happened?

491
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:39,250
He's fine. Apparently,
Mason was picking on

492
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,458
a kid in his class--
Neal segal.

493
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,041
Oh, come on.
Mason's a good kid.

494
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:44,834
There's gotta be more
to the story than that.

495
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:46,625
The principal said Mason was
provoking Neal.

496
00:22:46,667 --> 00:22:48,542
That's why he bit Mason.

497
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:50,834
Well, biting's not okay.
Well, neither is bullying.

498
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:53,000
Taunting a kid is
just asking for trouble,

499
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:54,041
and if it happens again,

500
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:55,750
the principal's threatened
to suspend him.

501
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:57,333
I will go down to the school.
I will talk to the principal.

502
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,959
No,
you need to talk to Mason.

503
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
We need to cut him
some slack.

504
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:04,041
He is scared and stressed about
what's going on here.

505
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:06,041
You need to quit making excuses.
We have to punish him.

506
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:08,166
He needs stability.
He needs nurturing.

507
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:12,375
What he needs is a clear sense
of right and wrong,

508
00:23:12,417 --> 00:23:15,041
and if his father's too much
of a wuss to teach it to him,

509
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:17,041
then I'll do it,
just like I do everything else.

510
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:19,041
Really?

511
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:21,041
Well, I'm sorry I've been
in the nicu 24 hours a day,

512
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:22,917
trying to keep
our daughter alive

513
00:23:22,959 --> 00:23:25,709
and watching Sam put her back
on a ventilator and--

514
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,083
wait.

515
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:28,834
What the hell are
you talking about?

516
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:30,041
She...

517
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:33,041
She has r.S.V. Pneumonia.

518
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:35,041
Since when?

519
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,041
I noticed something
this morning.

520
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,041
I had them run the tests.

521
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:40,083
Why didn't you tell me?

522
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:42,041
I've been trying
to protect you, Charlotte.

523
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:44,417
Like you're trying
to protect Mason?

524
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:46,041
You are such an idiot,
Cooper.

525
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:48,041
You are not the only one
trying to keep

526
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:49,041
this family together,
Charlotte.

527
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:51,041
No, I am the only one
stuck in this bed...

528
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:53,667
Oh!
Every damn day.
Just get the hell out.

529
00:23:53,709 --> 00:23:55,333
Yeah. Gladly.

530
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:03,333
♪ beep, beep, back it up,

baby laughed for the first time,

556
00:25:09,166 --> 00:25:11,792
"its laugh broke
into a thousand pieces,

557
00:25:11,834 --> 00:25:14,375
"and they all went
skipping about,

558
00:25:14,417 --> 00:25:17,959
and that was the beginning
of fairies."

559
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,333
You're gonna laugh for me
one day.

560
00:25:23,208 --> 00:25:26,041
You have to.

561
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:30,333
Surprise!

562
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:33,250
It's your
nonshower shower!

563
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:34,834
Why aren't you with my baby,
Addison?

564
00:25:34,875 --> 00:25:37,625
Because Cooper is. Hey,
I thought of a good baby name.

565
00:25:37,667 --> 00:25:39,375
What do you think of olive?

566
00:25:39,417 --> 00:25:41,166
I think
it's a Martini ingredient.

567
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:42,625
Why didn't you bring
Mason by today?

568
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:44,166
He didn't want to come,
and Cooper said it was okay.

569
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:46,667
Well, screw, Cooper.
If I want to see my damn kid,

570
00:25:46,709 --> 00:25:48,583
that's my god-given right.
You want a cupcake?

571
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:50,000
Do I look like
I want a cupcake?

572
00:25:50,041 --> 00:25:51,333
So that's a no then?

573
00:25:51,375 --> 00:25:52,834
Yes, it's a no.
I don't want your cupcakes

574
00:25:52,875 --> 00:25:54,667
or your flowers
or your presents.

575
00:25:54,709 --> 00:25:58,667
What part of "I don't want
a shower" was unclear, Amelia?

576
00:25:58,709 --> 00:26:00,333
We thought that
this would cheer you up.

577
00:26:00,375 --> 00:26:01,458
You know
what would cheer me up?

578
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,583
If you got your asses
out of my room.

579
00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:04,709
Mmm. That's not gonna happen.

580
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,250
Hey, Charlotte,

581
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:07,625
for patients who are on bed rest

582
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:10,041
in the same room
for an extended period of time,

583
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:11,500
it's natural they develop
a kind of cabin fever...
One, two, three,
four, five, six,

584
00:26:11,542 --> 00:26:13,000
seven, eight, nine, ten.

585
00:26:13,041 --> 00:26:15,166
And on top of that, you want
to see your baby girl...

586
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:16,834
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

587
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,375
It's hard for persons
used to being in control...

588
00:26:18,417 --> 00:26:20,500
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

589
00:26:20,542 --> 00:26:23,000
...take care of things
and them.

590
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:24,208
Smell that.

591
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,375
Which one's a trapezoid?

592
00:26:27,417 --> 00:26:28,583
It's a square at an angle?

593
00:26:28,625 --> 00:26:30,917
No. No. Wait. That's a rhombus.

594
00:26:30,959 --> 00:26:32,291
All those years
in school,

595
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:34,625
and the only thing I remember
is that cinema class.

596
00:26:34,667 --> 00:26:37,208
By the way,
Elsa didn't love Rick.

597
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,291
Love story, my ass.

598
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:41,208
Every good romance
ends in death.

599
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,875
Without a plane crash,
consumption,

600
00:26:42,917 --> 00:26:44,291
or third-degree burns,

601
00:26:44,333 --> 00:26:46,083
two people can't just stand
the test of time.

602
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:48,083
Mama.

603
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:50,458
Didn't you hear me?

604
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,208
I heard you didn't want
to see me.

605
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:54,959
I didn't want to get yelled at.
Neal bit me.

606
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,208
Because you provoked him.

607
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,750
And when you push someone
too far, well--

608
00:26:58,792 --> 00:27:00,500
someday I'll show you
"the burning bed,"

609
00:27:00,542 --> 00:27:02,208
and then you'll understand.

610
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,542
I never did it before.

611
00:27:03,583 --> 00:27:05,041
That's not the same
as never doing it at all.

612
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:07,333
Everyone hates Neal.
He's weird.

613
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,667
Well, that's even worse.

614
00:27:08,709 --> 00:27:11,542
You want to be a sheep?
Follow the herd?

615
00:27:11,583 --> 00:27:13,041
Or do you want to be a man?

616
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:15,333
The kind of person
who sticks up for others?

617
00:27:15,375 --> 00:27:18,333
Not only did you bully a kid,

618
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:22,125
which is horrible and cruel
and never okay,

619
00:27:22,166 --> 00:27:24,959
but you lied to me.

620
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,917
Did you apologize to Neal?
No.

621
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:29,041
Well, you have to.
Why are you being so mean?

622
00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:30,333
Why are you being
so selfish?

623
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:32,166
I'm the one stuck
in this bed.

624
00:27:32,208 --> 00:27:33,959
Your dad's racing between me

625
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,291
and your baby sister
in the nicu.

626
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:38,083
And instead of being helpful,
you're just acting out.

627
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:40,083
What the hell's wrong
with you?
Are you finished?

628
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:42,667
Don't you get fresh with me.

629
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:46,959
We still have to discuss
your punishment.

630
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,041
Dad already did. No TV
or video games for a week.

631
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:51,792
Not a week. A month.

632
00:27:51,834 --> 00:27:55,208
And you will apologize to Neal
and to his parents.

633
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:58,166
That's not fair.
Well, life isn't fair.
Get used to it.

634
00:27:58,208 --> 00:28:00,291
I hate you! I hate you!

635
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,333
I hate me, too.

636
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,375
I got your page.
What's going on?

637
00:28:13,417 --> 00:28:14,750
Well, sats are dropping.

638
00:28:14,792 --> 00:28:16,041
B.p. And heart rate
are unstable.

639
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:18,208
What's her chest X-ray
look like?

640
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:19,250
Worse. Diffuse infiltrate.

641
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:21,041
I haven't told Cooper yet.

642
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:22,458
I want to present him
with all the options.

643
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,333
If we oxygenate the blood
outside the body,

644
00:28:25,375 --> 00:28:26,417
there's a chance that--

645
00:28:26,458 --> 00:28:28,125
no. Ecmo's too dangerous
and invasive.

646
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:30,041
Well, then what other option
do we have?

647
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,834
I don't know, but ecmo you can't
even do until 34 weeks.

648
00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:33,041
She's still too young.

649
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:34,417
Plus, there's no guarantee
of survival,

650
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:36,750
and then you run the risk

651
00:28:36,792 --> 00:28:38,875
of bleeding, infection,
clotting, strokes.

652
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:40,542
Well, pneumonia presents
just as big a threat.

653
00:28:40,583 --> 00:28:42,375
The ectopia cordis
and the prematurity--

654
00:28:42,417 --> 00:28:44,166
I mean, she's--

655
00:28:44,208 --> 00:28:45,250
she's already looking
at such a hard life.

656
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:47,083
I-I just...

657
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:48,417
I don't know if such
an aggressive approach

658
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:49,583
is what's best for her.

659
00:28:49,625 --> 00:28:51,083
Well, it's not for her.

660
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:53,208
We'd be doing this
for Cooper and Charlotte.

661
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,709
Do what for us?

662
00:28:57,834 --> 00:29:01,083
It's a long shot,
but...

663
00:29:01,125 --> 00:29:04,458
They think that ecmo is
our best option.

664
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,375
How long would she be
on bypass?

665
00:29:06,417 --> 00:29:09,041
A week.

666
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:10,291
And blood thinners.

667
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:11,667
So Amelia would do
an ultrasound

668
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:14,208
every day to make sure
there's not a brain bleed.

669
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:16,166
And if the ecmo
doesn't work?

670
00:29:16,208 --> 00:29:19,750
Well, then our--our daughter
will die.

671
00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:30,208
I thought we'd have this magical
first Christmas with Mason.

672
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:33,083
Mm, buy the biggest tree
on the lot,

673
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:35,333
drink hot chocolate,

674
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:37,458
lie around in our p.J.S
on Christmas morning,

675
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:41,959
come up with names
for our girls.

676
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,917
Just be a family.

677
00:29:45,792 --> 00:29:47,375
But now?

678
00:29:49,291 --> 00:29:50,500
I know.

679
00:29:50,542 --> 00:29:53,125
No, you don't.

680
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,375
You've held her

681
00:29:59,417 --> 00:30:01,166
and you've kissed her head

682
00:30:01,208 --> 00:30:04,166
and you've talked to her.

683
00:30:04,208 --> 00:30:05,834
She knows her daddy.

684
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:09,500
But me?

685
00:30:11,417 --> 00:30:14,792
Our daughter may die before
I ever get to meet her.

686
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:45,750
Pump is primed.
Venous catheter's in.

687
00:30:45,792 --> 00:30:47,625
Okay.
I got some bleeding here.

688
00:30:47,667 --> 00:30:49,000
What bleeding? What's wrong?

689
00:30:49,041 --> 00:30:51,709
Nothing's wrong, Coop.
We got this, okay?

690
00:30:54,667 --> 00:30:57,583
Hello, precious girl.

691
00:30:57,625 --> 00:30:59,291
This is your mama.

692
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:02,041
Sorry you don't have
a name yet.

693
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:04,667
I want so much to be with you
right now,

694
00:31:04,709 --> 00:31:07,041
hold your little hand,

695
00:31:07,083 --> 00:31:08,750
tell you everything's
gonna be okay.

696
00:31:08,792 --> 00:31:10,834
And let you know

697
00:31:10,875 --> 00:31:12,041
you are blessed.

698
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:16,041
It may not seem like it,
but you are.

699
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:19,041
I should be praying.

700
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:21,875
Right now,
I don't even know how.

701

Maybe we should have a Christmas
tree up all year round.

All right, guys, hold up
your hot chocolate mugs.

889
00:40:10,959 --> 00:40:13,917
I want sissy to see what
her first Christmas was like.

890
00:40:13,959 --> 00:40:15,917
Yeah,
we gotta name that baby

with "sissy" forever.

All right, but I'm not budging
on Marjorie.

Yeah.

899
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:35,041
We gotta do something.
I'll get a nurse.

00:40:35,083 --> 00:40:37,041
Mase!
Wait. Let him go.

901
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:39,875
I don't think they'll answer
the call button anymore.

902
00:40:39,917 --> 00:40:43,208
Oh, my god.
I can leave the room.

903

I need to go to the nicu.
I need to see her.

914
00:41:03,959 --> 00:41:05,917
You're in labor.
No. No. No. You gotta go to
delivery, recovery,

915
00:41:05,959 --> 00:41:08,917
and then the nicu.
These two ain't coming
this second.
