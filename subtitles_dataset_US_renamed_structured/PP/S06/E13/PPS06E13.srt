00:00:08,083 --> 00:00:09,333
Okay.
I want to say something wise.

3
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:12,917
I want to have some wisdom.

4
00:00:12,959 --> 00:00:15,041
I mean...

5
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:16,375
I've been here before.

6
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:19,333
I've done this already.

7
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:20,750
The first time you get married--

8
00:00:20,792 --> 00:00:25,041
I mean, had this very large
fairy tale wedding.

9
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:27,375
You know, with the music
and the flowers

10
00:00:27,417 --> 00:00:29,959
and the dress.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,458
I was young and marrying the guy
that everyone said was

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,750
the perfect man.

13
00:00:36,792 --> 00:00:39,041
And he was.

14
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:42,834
Derek was perfect.

15
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:45,041
Turns out, he just...

16
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:46,959
Wasn't perfect for me.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,250
And even though I made
my fair share of mistakes,

18
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:51,458
I definitely...

19
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,667
Was not innocent.

20
00:00:53,709 --> 00:00:59,041
I was really angry at him
for messing up my fairy tale.

21
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:01,041
And...

22
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:02,667
For taking my 30s

23
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:05,291
and for being happy
with someone else

24
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:10,000
and for making me feel
like a failure.

25
00:01:11,834 --> 00:01:13,583
And it took me
a really long time

26
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:16,250
to get over that.

27
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:19,834
And I made a lot of mistakes

28
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:21,709
with a lot of men,

29
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,000
trying to get over that.

30
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:28,625
But...

31
00:01:28,667 --> 00:01:33,291
Then slowly, over time,

32
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:36,709
everything changes,

33
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,709
and you're no longer
this young thing

34
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:42,041
and you don't believe
in fairy tales

35
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:46,709
and "perfect" isn't
in your vocabulary.

36
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:54,333
And then suddenly,

37
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:58,333
here is this man.

38
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,583
Addison.
I can't do it. I can't.

39
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:11,041
People are waiting.
Jake is waiting.

40
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:13,083
I just said that I can't do it,
not like this.

41
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:14,500
Okay. All right. Hey.

42
00:02:14,542 --> 00:02:16,583
Addison, Addison,
stop pacing, okay? Look at me.

43
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:18,083
Deep breaths.

44
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:21,667
You can do this.
You wanna do this.

45
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:23,500
You love Jake
and you are ready.

46
00:02:23,542 --> 00:02:25,125
And the preacher guy
is gonna leave

47
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:26,959
- because we only paid him for two hours.
- Amelia.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,375
Problem solved!

49
00:02:28,417 --> 00:02:30,041
- I'm here.
- Oh!

50
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,375
I'm so sorry. Sorry.
I'm so sorry.

51
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:32,792
The plane was late

52
00:02:32,834 --> 00:02:35,917
and was circling
for some ridiculous reason.
Oh!

53
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:37,500
And I was freaking out.
I was--i was trying to--
aw!

54
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:39,500
I was trying to call you

Cell phone,

56
00:02:40,834 --> 00:02:42,291
and I thought the stewardess
was gonna freak out.

57
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,041
I thought the air Marshall
was gonna take me down.

to get to the honeymoon

179
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,333
a little bit early.

180
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,041
Should I send the photographer
down there

181
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:35,458
to get photos of that?

182
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,542
Yes.
Yes.

183
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:47,000
Mmm.
Mmm.

184
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,875
Okay. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.
Wait. Wait. Wait.

185
00:07:48,917 --> 00:07:51,041
Okay. Ahem. We should stop.
We should stop. We should stop.

186
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,083
Right?

187
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:55,000
We should stop.

188
00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:03,041
Last Sunday, I woke up
and I had a lot of energy,

189
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,458
so I went for a run.

190
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,125
Then I went home
and did some baking.

191
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,041
There's this really good

192
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:10,375
double chocolate
peanut butter chip brownie thing

193
00:08:10,417 --> 00:08:12,041
that I've been working on.

194
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,333
It's... crazy.

195
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,959
And, um, then...

196
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,041
I watched a movie,

197
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:21,291
did some laundry, and, uh...

198
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:24,750
It wasn't until
I went to bed that

199
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:27,041
I realized it was the day.

200
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,125
The 6-year anniversary.

201
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:32,417
How'd that make you feel?

202
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:35,500
Um, a little bit guilty,

203
00:08:35,542 --> 00:08:39,375
'cause it doesn't feel right
that I should just forget them.

204
00:08:39,417 --> 00:08:42,333
Then I felt relieved.

205
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:46,041
I was just relieved.
I'm relieved.

206
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:49,125
Tell me your truth.

207
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,166
My parents
and boyfriend died

208
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:54,208
in a car accident
that I survived.

209
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,041
Say it again.

210
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,250
My parents
and boyfriend died

211
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:01,041
in a car accident
that I survived.

212
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:04,125
Do you remember how long it
took you to come up with that?

213
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,375
How long it took you
to say it out loud?

214
00:09:06,417 --> 00:09:08,417
They died. I survived.

215
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:10,083
You survived.

216
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:16,375
Holly, our time is up,
but I...

217
00:09:16,417 --> 00:09:19,041
Wanna tell you something
that's very good.

218
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,250
Okay.

219
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,792
I think we're done here.

220
00:09:21,834 --> 00:09:23,709
What?

221
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,709
Well, you've been coming
to see me for five years,

222
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,041
sometimes more than
once a week.

223
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,875
Now you're off your meds.

224
00:09:30,917 --> 00:09:32,875
You moved out
of your aunt's house.

225
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:34,500
You have an apartment
and a job now.

226
00:09:34,542 --> 00:09:36,083
You're applying
to cooking schools.

227
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:38,709
Yeah, but, um,
does that mean that i--

228
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,875
Holly, last month, you visited
your boyfriend's parents.

229
00:09:41,917 --> 00:09:44,041
You were able
to sit and talk with them

230
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,041
for the first time
since he died.

231
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,166
That's the final step
on your goal list.

232
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:51,625
And listening to you now,
I...

233
00:09:51,667 --> 00:09:54,041
I think it's time.

234
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,417
I think you're ready
to graduate.

235
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:59,125
I think you can do this
on your own.

236
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,500
Great.

237
00:10:02,542 --> 00:10:04,333
Great.

238
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,500
Hey!

239
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:10,041
Right on time
as usual, huh?

240
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,417
Mm, punctuality's important...

241
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,041
Especially now.
Especially now.

242
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,083
I knew you were gonna
make a joke,

243
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,750
but I-I wanted
to beat you to it.

244
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,083
Hey. Miranda!

245
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:22,125
Miranda.
Roll her on her side.

246
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,542
I got her airway.

247
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,333
Someone call the paramedics.
I need 10 of lorazepam.

248
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,041
She hasn't seized before.

249
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,125
We're gonna take care of her,
Sheldon.

250
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,000
You okay?

251
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:39,917
I knew it was stage iv.
It was always stage iv.

252
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:43,083
So this was inevitable,
but...

253
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:46,959
Knowing it isn't the same
as... knowing it.

254
00:10:48,792 --> 00:10:51,709
She's really dying now.

255
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,750
It's open.

256
00:10:53,792 --> 00:10:55,041
Hey.

257
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:58,583
I come bearing shrimp chow fun
and fortune cookies.

258
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,375
Wow.

259
00:11:01,417 --> 00:11:02,583
You have no idea, okay?

260
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,041
I have to feed
all three of 'em.

261
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,959
By the time I get
to the last one,

262
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,500
the first one is hungry
and crying again,

263
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,041
and they've started--

264
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,291
they've started this crazy
synchronized pooping.

265
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,709
No, no. I swear to god.
I think they gave a signal.

266
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,083
One of them poops...
Cooper...

267
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,959
And then
the other one poops...
I feel like you need to...

268
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,375
And the other one poops.
Sit down
and take a breath, okay?

269
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:23,834
They're evil
and they're working together,

270
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,166
and... I think
Caroline's the ringleader.

271
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,625
I hate them, Violet.

272
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:30,834
You don't hate them.

273
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,333
No, I love them.
They're my kids.

274
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,041
But how do people do this?
I mean, for years

275
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,125
I've been yammering on
to exhausted parents

276
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,667
about what a miracle time
this is.

277
00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:39,041
I'm surprised
no one's decked me.

278
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:40,875
It is a miracle.

279
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:42,250
You've been waitin'
your whole life for this.
I know.

280
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,250
And I told Charlotte I would
stay at home and raise them,

281
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:45,792
but now...

282
00:11:45,834 --> 00:11:48,834
But I can't handle it
and I'm about to snap, Violet.

283
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,208
So what do I do?
What am I supposed to do?

284
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,333
You know what to do.

285
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,000
You're gonna tell me
to talk to Charlotte.

286
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,583
Your father's
finally learning.

287
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,583
You didn't have to
take a cab.

288
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,583
Oh, you were working.
You know...

289
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:07,917
Well, I would've
come and gotten you

290
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:09,208
and take the day off,
had I known you were coming.

291
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,417
This is very momentous.

292
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:11,625
You haven't visited
in two years,

293
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:13,041
and now I got you twice
in three months?

294
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,709
Well, I-I have to be
in San Francisco tomorrow

295
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,250
and I thought, you know,
why not...

296
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:17,458
Stop off and have
a little detour?

297
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,709
Well, good!
So... yeah.

298
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,208
Come on. Now listen.
Do you want to do a late lunch

299
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,458
or can you wait till dinner?

300
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,208
'Cause Jake makes a steak
so rare

301
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,667
you can still
talk to the cow.

302
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,500
Oh, hey. You okay?

303
00:12:29,542 --> 00:12:30,875
Yeah.

304
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,834
Uh, yeah. It's...
Don't mention food.

305
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,041
Are you queasy?

306
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,250
Yeah. It's probably...
The--the flight.

307
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,041
It was really bumpy,
you know?

308
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:40,333
Yeah? I was gonna say. You're
not pregnant, are you?

309
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,625
Oh, my...
What?

310
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:44,959
Is that...

311
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,125
Are you?

312
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,959
Yes.

313
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,709
Oh!
I'm still trying
to get used to the idea,

314
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,083
so please don't tell anybody.

315
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,917
But fife must be thrilled,
right?

316
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:58,083
Yeah.

317
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,208
Oh, Nai! A baby!

318
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,041
Yeah.
Oh!
Congratulations.

319
00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:10,959
Okay, Nai, everything
looks great. Heartbeat's strong.

320
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,959
Look, you can see it.

321
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,041
Okay.

322
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,000
You gotta start talking.

323
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,458
Something--
something's wrong.

324
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,083
What? No, I'm happy.

325
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:25,375
I'm--i am. I'm really happy
about the... the baby.

326
00:13:25,417 --> 00:13:27,041
It's...

327
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,583
It's--you know,
it's just that, uh,

328
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:29,917
fife and I aren't--
aren't doing well.

329
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:31,750
We're not...

330
00:13:31,792 --> 00:13:33,542
It's kind of not working.

331
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,166
I thought everything was good.
You didn't say anything.

332
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:36,375
Well, you were
getting married.

333
00:13:36,417 --> 00:13:37,959
You know, it's...

334
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,917
It's that fife works a lot,
and he--and he travels a lot.

335
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:43,583
He's a good guy. He is.

336
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,500
He's--he's--he's just
a researcher first.

337
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:47,000
You know, he's married
to his work.

338
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,709
Well, are you two
in counseling?

339
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,750
Addie, fife doesn't
live with me anymore.

340
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,834
We're done.

341
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,166
Oh. I-I...

342
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,500
I just thought
with the baby...

343
00:13:56,542 --> 00:13:58,417
Well, you know,
things happen. Huh?

344
00:13:58,458 --> 00:13:59,834
Lucky me.

345
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,041
Every relationship's wrong

346
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,542
unless it's the right one,
right?

347
00:14:04,542 --> 00:14:06,041
Um...

348
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,083
What about, uh, you and Sam?

349
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,041
What?

350
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,291
W-Well, we never
talked about it.

351
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,083
W-Why did you you guys
break up?

352
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,500
Oh.

353
00:14:15,542 --> 00:14:17,875
Nai, um...

354
00:14:17,917 --> 00:14:19,667
W-Well, Sam--
he didn't want kids.

355
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:21,208
You know, which was sad
and frustrating.

356
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,625
But in the end, it was great
because I have Jake,

357
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:26,750
and Jake loves kids.
He loves Henry.

358
00:14:26,792 --> 00:14:30,458
So it all turned out
the way it was supposed to.

359
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,834
Yeah.

360
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:34,125
Hey, I am here for you,
all right?

361
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,959
No matter what.

362
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
We'll figure this out.
Okay. Yeah.

363
00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:44,667
What happened?

364
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:47,333
Hey. You're okay. All right.

365
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:50,041
Miranda,
you had a seizure.

366
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:52,041
Oh. That's new.

367
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,500
Amelia had you admitted.

368
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:55,166
She says you need
to be monitored.

369
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,917
Mm. I need to be
on a beach somewhere,

370
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,166
drinking something
with an umbrella in it.

371
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:00,583
The scans show that y--

372
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:03,792
the scans show that
I'm dying of cancer. Yep.

373
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,166
I need you to stay for
observation, at least overnight.

374
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,458
Oh, I don't really think
that's necessary.

375
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,250
Miranda.

376
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:12,333
Please.

377
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:16,875
Okay, I'll stay one night.

378
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:18,583
Good.

379
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,875
Can I get you anything?

380
00:15:20,917 --> 00:15:22,959
A cure for cancer
would be nice.

381
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,125
No, you--you are not
dropping out of school.

382
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,333
I'm just taking
a semester off.

383
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:36,041
Okay. Can we--can we talk
about this for a minute?

384
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,709
Just...

385
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,458
Why?

386
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,291
I wanna go to Europe.
Rome.

387
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,041
Okay, I'll send you there
this summer.

388
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,250
It'll be my treat.

389
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,041
Or--or what about
studying abroad?

390
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,041
Eli is teaching there
next semester,

391
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,291
and he asked me to come.

392
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,542
I'm going.

393
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,417
You're making a mistake.

394
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:56,250
I love him.

395
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:57,875
Another mistake.

396
00:15:57,917 --> 00:15:59,542
I don't need your permission.
I just wanted you to know.

397
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,583
Look, Angela...

398
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,250
Oh, hi. I'm sorry.

399
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:10,041
I just walked past
your receptionist.

400
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,542
I'm interrupting you.

401
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,000
You're in the middle
of a million things, I'm sure.

402
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:16,083
I'm really--
Holly, Holly,
tell me what's wrong.

403
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,500
I, um, I-I got in.

404
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:21,250
I got accepted
to le cordon bleu in Paris.

405
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,500
I got into

406
00:16:22,542 --> 00:16:24,375
the best cooking school
in the world.

407
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:26,041
Holly! Congratulations!

408
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:30,041
No, it's no congratulations.
I can't go. It's in Paris.

409
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:32,500
This is what you wanted.
This is your dream.

410
00:16:32,542 --> 00:16:35,000
It's a big change,
it is out of your comfort zone,

411
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,166
but you can handle it.

412
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,583
What if something goes wrong?

413
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,375
We've talked about
you being ready.

414
00:16:39,417 --> 00:16:41,917
Uh, well, there's
a 9-hour time difference

415
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,917
between there and here.

416
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:46,709
And it's a whole continent
and an ocean away.

417
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,959
Okay, it is far, but--

418
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,792
no, it's an entire continent
and an ocean

419
00:16:50,834 --> 00:16:52,375
away from you.

420
00:16:52,417 --> 00:16:54,291
Oh, Holly.

421
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:57,500
You told me that if I ever
needed you, you would be there.

422
00:16:57,542 --> 00:16:59,625
So what if
something happens,

423
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:02,500
and I need you
and I'm in Paris?

424
00:17:02,542 --> 00:17:05,125
It doesn't...
Logically make sense.

425
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,792
It doesn't work.

426
00:17:09,667 --> 00:17:12,625
I'm not going.
I'm not leaving therapy.

427
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:14,250
I'm not ready.

428
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:20,959
I must say, I have missed
this kitchen.

429
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,583
This feels like home.

430
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,041
Aw, you should stay.

431
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,250
I'm serious.

432
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:26,875
Mmm, this is amazing.
What is this?

433
00:17:26,917 --> 00:17:29,041
Kale pasta salad,
with homemade pasta.

434
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,583
Wow.
My patient Holly made it.

435
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,125
Mmm.
You have a mental patient
who makes you food?

436
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:33,250
Charlotte.

437
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,041
I'm sorry.

438
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:38,208
I'm cranky and tired 'cause
copper's cranky and tired.

439
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,208
Man gets to stay home all day,
swimming in babies.

440
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,375
You think he'd be happy.
But no, he's moody as hell.

441
00:17:43,417 --> 00:17:45,000
My boobs are gonna explode.
I gotta go pump.

442
00:17:46,542 --> 00:17:49,041
Things have certainly
changed around here.

443
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,834
You know, your mental patient's
very talented.

444
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,041
She should be a chef.

445
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,250
She got accepted
to the cordon bleu...

446
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,041
Mm!
But she's not gonna go.

447
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,667
She's afraid to leave therapy.
She's afraid to leave me.

448
00:17:57,709 --> 00:18:00,041
You know, maybe I misjudged.

449
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,250
I'm gonna let her
keep coming in.

450
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,875
Oh. Hey. Hey, everybody.

451
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,041
Hi.

452
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,500
Hey. Yeah.
It's na--Naomi.

453
00:18:06,542 --> 00:18:08,458
I didn't know you were...
Are you--what are you...

454
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,333
Uh, no, yeah,
I'm just coming through

455
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:12,542
and I was visiting Addie.
Oh.

456
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,875
Yeah.
That's great. That's great.

457
00:18:14,917 --> 00:18:16,750
Ha!

458
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:18,709
Oops. Sorry.

459
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,333
Did you...
Sorry. No, I...

460
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,041
Sam?

461
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,917
Yeah? Nah, nah.

462
00:18:26,959 --> 00:18:28,750
I'm not that thir--thirsty.

463
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:37,750
Girl, holy crap.
That's...

464
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:39,041
That's really good.

465
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,625
Right?
Mm-hmm.

466
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:43,333
So good. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

467
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,000
You're 13 weeks pregnant,
aren't you?

468
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,250
W-What?

469
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,125
Yeah, you should know. You just
did the ultrasound today.

470
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:54,291
I mean exactly 13 weeks,

471
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,458
because that's when
I got married.

472
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,166
13 weeks ago.

473
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,291
Naomi?

474
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,083
It just happened.

475
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,875
Oh!

476
00:19:08,917 --> 00:19:10,250
It just happened.

477
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,041
I don't know--i don't even know
why it happened.

478
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:14,250
We're divorced. We're--
we're good. We've got closure.

479
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,291
But it--we just saw each other,
and...

480
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,041
Oh, god.
I don't know. It's Sam.

481
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,375
You know. It's--it's Sam.

482
00:19:19,417 --> 00:19:20,834
Okay, my brain is exploding.

483
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,083
What, and you think mine isn't?

484
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,709
When are you gonna
tell him?

485
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,291
I'm not gonna
tell him anything.

486
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,917
Nai, you have to!

487
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:29,041
The baby's gonna come out
looking exactly like a tiny Sam.

488
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,417
He is with Stephanie.

489
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:32,041
And the reason
you two didn't work out

490
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,041
is because he doesn't want
any more kids, right?

491
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,208
So why would I tell him?

492
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,500
Because he's Sam.

493
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:39,166
I mean, you didn't just have
a one-night stand

494
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:40,375
with some random guy.

495
00:19:40,417 --> 00:19:42,333
You chose to sleep with Sam.

496
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,333
And maybe the reason why the two
of you ended up in bed together

497
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:47,041
is because...
It still means something.

498
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,625
No.

499
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:52,250
No. Sam--Sam walked out
on our marriage.

500
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,750
He walked out. He just quit.

501
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:56,125
He--he decided he was done.
He didn't fight for us.

502
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,917
He just blew us up. I...

503
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,208
And there's a history
with... us.

504
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,000
You know, I...

505
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,041
It can't mean anything.

506
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,375
It can't. And I-I can't
sit around hoping that it does.

507
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:10,667
I'm sorry.

508
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,458
You are in love with him,
Naomi.

509
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,875
You know,
it's--it's getting late,

510
00:20:13,917 --> 00:20:15,041
and I have
an early flight tomorrow,

511
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,458
so I gotta--
I gotta go to bed.

512
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,291
Naomi.
Leave it alone, Addison.

513
00:20:28,917 --> 00:20:31,375
I can feel you staring
at me.

514
00:20:31,417 --> 00:20:32,792
No, I'm not.

515
00:20:32,834 --> 00:20:35,041
Look, Addison, whatever
it is you're dying to say

516
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:38,041
and think you can't say,
just say it.

517
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:43,375
Okay. Naomi slept with Sam
on our wedding night,

518
00:20:43,417 --> 00:20:46,250
and now she's pregnant
with Sam's baby.

519
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:48,834
You can't tell Sam.

520
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:51,041
I don't want to tell Sam.
Why can't I tell Sam?

521
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,834
Because it's none of
your business. All right?

522
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,250
Fine.

523
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,375
Ahem.

524
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:02,500
Hi.

525
00:21:02,542 --> 00:21:03,709
When I first moved to L.A.,

526
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,917
Sam told me that
he blew apart his marriage

527
00:21:05,959 --> 00:21:07,041
and he never understood why.

528
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,250
I still don't think
he understands why.

529
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:10,333
But now I think
that the reason why

530
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:12,959
Sam's never been able to make it
work with another woman

531
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:15,458
is because he'll always
be in love with Naomi.

532
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,041
And then me,
with my cheater past,

533
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,250
I just jumped in there

534
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:20,500
and started dating
my best friend's ex-husband.

535
00:21:20,542 --> 00:21:22,041
And then I hurt her,
I hurt him.

536
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:24,083
And you know what?
He's not happy with Stephanie.

537
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,333
And she left fife.

538
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,625
And so how is it fair
that I get to be happy,

539
00:21:27,667 --> 00:21:31,875
all married to you,
hot Saint man?

540
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:33,041
And they're gonna
be miserable

541
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,792
because she's got
such pride,

542
00:21:35,834 --> 00:21:37,041
and he's got such...

543
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,291
Prejudice?

544
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,000
You realize this isn't
a Jane Austen novel, right?

545
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:42,041
Oh, shut up.

546
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,625
You shut up. Get in here.

547
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,083
Hey.

548
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,667
Addison?
Do you love Stephanie?

549
00:22:01,709 --> 00:22:03,041
What?

550
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:05,291
Do you... love Stephanie?

551
00:22:06,834 --> 00:22:08,166
I mean, I don't...
That's none of y--

552
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:10,041
I don't see how that's any of
y--of your--uh, your business.

553
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:11,291
No, it's not.
It's really not.

554
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:14,583
But Nai...
She's my business.

555
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,792
Oh.

556
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:19,583
Look...

557
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:21,792
Okay, what happened between
Nai and me...

558
00:22:21,834 --> 00:22:24,000
We were confused.
It was a mistake.

559
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:26,000
It happened once.
End of story

560
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:27,291
okay,
I'm gonna say a thing,

561
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:29,291
and you can take it
or leave it, whatever.

562
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:31,291
Naomi and fife
never got married.

563
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:33,583
They are no longer together.

564
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:36,083
And...
That is all I'm gonna say.

565
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:38,959
I've already said
way too much.

566
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,041
Okay, I'm gonna say
one more thing.

567
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:43,583
She is in love with you.
Naomi is still in love with you.

568
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:46,208
And I am... 72% certain

569
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:50,458
that I did the right thing
in telling you this information.

570
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,250
Hi.

571
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:00,917
Why are you out of bed?

572
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:02,041
I'm going home.

573
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:04,375
No, you--you haven't
been discharged.

574
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:07,041
I know. That's why I'm filling
out this fancy form

575
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:11,041
that says I'm leaving against
medical advice.

576
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:14,000
Miranda. Miranda.

577
00:23:15,667 --> 00:23:17,792
I know how you feel
about hospitals,

578
00:23:17,834 --> 00:23:20,041
but... you should stay.

579
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:21,250
I'd be here with you.

580
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:24,041
You know, every--
every single day.

581
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:26,041
You know if I stay here,

582
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:27,667
they're gonna send in
oncologists

583
00:23:27,709 --> 00:23:30,083
and radiation therapists
and surgeons.

584
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:33,583
And that no matter what they do,
the tumor inside my brain

585
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:36,500
is still gonna destroy
my ability to talk and walk

586
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:38,792
and go to the bathroom.

587
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,792
Before you know it,
I'm gonna be throwing up

588
00:23:40,834 --> 00:23:42,667
and wearing diapers,

589
00:23:42,709 --> 00:23:46,041
and I'm not gonna remember
your name.

590
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:47,417
I'm gonna be in so much pain,

591
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:49,041
they're gonna ply me
with morphine,

592
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:52,417
which will make me numb,
and that will make me drool.

593
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:53,834
And there's so much more--

594
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:57,041
a thousand other
horrible indignities

595
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:59,083
I just haven't
thought of yet.

596
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:02,750
So I don't really wanna spend
my last days here.

597
00:24:02,792 --> 00:24:04,333
Can you...

598
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:06,542
Understand that?

599
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:08,542
Okay.

600
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:10,542
Okay. I'll--I'll take you home.
I'll take care of you.

601
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:12,542
No. I don't want you
to take care of me, Sheldon.

602
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:15,959
I don't you changing
my diapers.

603
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Okay.

604
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:20,542
If you need to, we--we can
get you a private nurse.

605
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:22,000
Look, you've come
this far with me,

606
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:23,375
and I really appreciate that.

607
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:29,792
But this is the last leg
of a really long journey.

608
00:24:29,834 --> 00:24:32,166
And the good part is over now
and the bad part is starting,

609
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:36,000
and I don't want you with me.
I don't want you to see this.

610
00:24:37,834 --> 00:24:40,000
No.

611
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:43,041
I want you to walk away

612
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:44,333
and not look back.

613
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:48,375
I-I want you to go
while I can...

614
00:24:48,417 --> 00:24:49,917
Still remember how much...

615
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:52,583
I love you.

616
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:56,083
If you care about me at all,

617
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:58,041
you will do this for me.

618
00:24:58,083 --> 00:25:00,458
Please.

619
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,125
Just go.

620
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:06,834
Just walk away,
Sheldon. Just go.

621
00:25:08,417 --> 00:25:11,041
Fine, then I'll walk away.

622
00:25:26,667 --> 00:25:28,583
Oh, thank god. Mom's home.

623
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:32,166
How are my babies?

624
00:25:32,208 --> 00:25:33,583
Shh!
Shh!

625
00:25:33,625 --> 00:25:35,750
They're asleep.
Lower you voice.

626
00:25:35,792 --> 00:25:38,417
Lord, am I beat.

627
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:42,000
I forget how being
on, uh, your feet all day

628
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,583
can really take it
out of ya.

629
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:44,792
You barely finish up
with one patient

630
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:46,041
before another one needs ya.

631
00:25:49,667 --> 00:25:51,458
We need to hire a nanny.

632
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,000
What? No.

633
00:25:54,041 --> 00:25:55,959
No?

634
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,166
The deal was you'd stay home
with the kids

635
00:25:57,208 --> 00:25:58,667
and I'd go back to work.

636
00:25:58,709 --> 00:26:01,083
I'm not changing things just
'cause you had a rough day.

637
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:02,667
Ah.

638
00:26:04,417 --> 00:26:05,625
Run.

639
00:26:09,625 --> 00:26:11,166
You see this shirt?

640
00:26:11,208 --> 00:26:13,667
I don't know
if these stains are

641
00:26:13,709 --> 00:26:16,208
vomit or breast milk anymore

642
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,417
because I've been wearing it
for five days.

643
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:19,625
Five.

644
00:26:19,667 --> 00:26:20,834
I know that to be true

645
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:22,041
because I haven't had a shower
in five days.

646
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:24,458
I'm pretty sure last night
I fell asleep in closet,

647
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,625
looking for diapers.
And I don't know how

648
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:28,041
to have a conversation
with adults anymore unless it's

649
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:29,709
the other sleepy-deprived moms
in the park.

650
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,875
And by the way,
after I bond with them

651
00:26:31,917 --> 00:26:33,291
over the psychosis that comes

652
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:35,834
with being your child's
primary caregiver,

653
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:37,208
I'll eventually have sex
with one of them

654
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,750
because they're, you know,
on the same feeding schedule.

655
00:26:39,792 --> 00:26:43,041
Is that what you want, me having
sex with moms in the park?

656
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:45,458
Because that's where
this is headed.

657
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,875
We need to hire a nanny.

658
00:26:57,291 --> 00:26:58,750
You wanna watch a movie?

659
00:26:58,792 --> 00:27:01,291
Uh, sure.

660
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:05,041
Or we can go to a movie.

661
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:06,500
Uh... Whatever
you want to do.

662
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:09,000
Sam, why am I here?

663
00:27:11,083 --> 00:27:12,500
We're--we're...
We're hanging out.

664
00:27:12,542 --> 00:27:15,166
Yet you haven't heard
a word I've said.

665
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:21,542
I'm sorry. You're right.

666
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,333
Uh...

667
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:27,709
I haven't heard a word
you've said because, uh...

668
00:27:30,792 --> 00:27:32,041
I'm trying to figure out

669
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:35,125
how I'm gonna say
what I need to say to you.

670
00:27:35,166 --> 00:27:38,166
Then just say it.
Whatever it is, just say it.

671
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:43,375
Okay. Well, when we...

672
00:27:43,417 --> 00:27:48,041
The first time
we got together, uh...

673
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:51,166
You broke up with me.
You--you said I was a mess.

674
00:27:51,208 --> 00:27:54,041
And, uh, I didn't see it.

675
00:27:54,083 --> 00:27:56,041
Well, I guess you don't
see things until...

676
00:27:56,083 --> 00:27:58,625
You're ready to see them.

677
00:27:58,667 --> 00:28:01,041
But you said I was a mess,

678
00:28:01,083 --> 00:28:02,583
and you were right.

679
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:05,125
But now i--
okay, stop.

680
00:28:05,166 --> 00:28:07,041
Just, um...

681
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:08,166
Just stop.

682
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,208
Okay.

683
00:28:14,375 --> 00:28:15,792
I'm gonna go now

684
00:28:15,834 --> 00:28:19,083
because I do not want you to
see me cry.

685
00:28:22,417 --> 00:28:24,000
I'm so sorry, Stephanie.
I don't...

686
00:28:24,041 --> 00:28:25,792
I'm sorry.
Sam, you're a good guy,

687
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:28,125
but let me give you
a little advice.

688
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:30,458
The next time you try to get
a second chance with a woman,

689
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,166
you better mean it,

690
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:34,667
because we're not
as tough as we look, okay?

691
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:40,041
And I liked her--
your ex-wife.

692
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:43,041
When I met her,
I liked her.

693
00:28:43,083 --> 00:28:44,250
Crap.

694
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:47,250
And now I'm crying.

695
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:49,041
And now you're gonna come over
here and comfort me,

696
00:28:49,083 --> 00:28:51,750
and I-I hate you.

697
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:02,375
So I've been working
on shellfish,

698
00:29:02,417 --> 00:29:04,041
and um, people think
that it's easy to do,

699
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:05,625
but people actually don't really
know what they're talking about

700
00:29:05,667 --> 00:29:07,125
'cause it's difficult to do.

701
00:29:07,166 --> 00:29:10,208
There are a lot of things
that you have to know about.
Holly. Holly.

702
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,000
This is gonna be
our last session.

703
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:13,166
If you call the office,

704
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:15,041
the receptionist is not gonna
allow you to book another one.

705
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:17,041
Why?
Because you don't need me
anymore.

706
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:18,750
You're in such a good place.

707
00:29:18,792 --> 00:29:20,208
You're talking about recipes
and not feelings.

708
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:22,041
That doesn't mean
that I'm ready to graduate.

709
00:29:22,083 --> 00:29:23,458
You are.

710
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,041
I... I've been coming
here for almost six years,

711
00:29:26,083 --> 00:29:28,834
and I'm supposed to just...
Stop?

712
00:29:28,875 --> 00:29:30,875
Yeah, because you're ready
to stop.

713
00:29:30,917 --> 00:29:32,959
How do you know?
You have to trust me.

714
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:34,333
I do trust you.

715
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:36,625
That's why I'm saying
I have to stay here with you.

716
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:38,041
Okay, why did you get
that acceptance letter

717
00:29:38,083 --> 00:29:39,250
from le cordon bleu?

718
00:29:39,291 --> 00:29:41,333
What?

719
00:29:41,375 --> 00:29:43,625
I applied and I got in.

720
00:29:43,667 --> 00:29:45,959
Right. You applied.

721
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,333
Cooking school is not something
that just happened to you.

722
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:51,875
It's not an accident taking
people away in your life.

723
00:29:51,917 --> 00:29:53,166
You chose it.

724
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,166
You want to go.

725
00:29:55,208 --> 00:29:58,041
And I'm afraid that you being
able to come back here,

726
00:29:58,083 --> 00:29:59,959
even though we both know that
you don't need it anymore,

727
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
is holding you back.

728
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,041
I'm scared.

729
00:30:12,083 --> 00:30:14,041
I know you are.

730
00:30:14,083 --> 00:30:15,250
New things are scary.

731
00:30:15,291 --> 00:30:18,125
Anything worth having
is scary.

732
00:30:18,166 --> 00:30:19,917
What if I don't like it?

733
00:30:19,959 --> 00:30:21,709
Well, you'll only know
if you try.

734
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,792
So I'm just some bird that
you're kicking out of the nest?

735
00:30:28,458 --> 00:30:31,375
You're like some bird.

736
00:30:31,417 --> 00:30:34,041
And, Holly,

737
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:36,208
you're ready to fly.

738
00:30:41,083 --> 00:30:42,583
Hey, guys.

739
00:30:45,834 --> 00:30:47,041
What's wrong?

740
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:49,917
Uh, nothin'.

741
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:51,375
I'm good.

742
00:30:51,417 --> 00:30:53,041
Hey, Sheldon, you got anything
in your shrink playbook

743
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:54,834
to help me convince Angela

744
00:30:54,875 --> 00:30:57,125
that dropping out of college
and moving to Rome

745
00:30:57,166 --> 00:31:00,625
with a guy 30 years older
than she is, is a bad idea?

746
00:31:00,667 --> 00:31:02,834
There really aren't any tricks
to convincing someone

747
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:05,041
that they're not in love.

748
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:07,166
It's a remarkable emotion,

749
00:31:07,208 --> 00:31:10,041
impervious to logic and...

750
00:31:10,083 --> 00:31:12,125
Turning the most measured people
into risk-takers

751
00:31:12,166 --> 00:31:15,000
willing to do anything
to maintain the feeling.

752
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:16,375
I mean...

753
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:19,125
Is there anything greater
than being in love?

754
00:31:19,166 --> 00:31:21,583
And I'm not saying that you
should give her your blessing.

755
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:23,542
I'm--I'm just saying
there's nothing you can do

756
00:31:23,583 --> 00:31:26,750
to stop her or to...

757
00:31:26,792 --> 00:31:29,875
To--to--to--to make her see...

758
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:35,625
Sheldon?

759
00:31:35,667 --> 00:31:37,041
I'm...

760
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:38,417
I'm madly in love,

761
00:31:38,458 --> 00:31:41,250
and, uh...

762
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:43,083
I quit.

763
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:44,333
I-I quit.

764
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:50,041
Did he just quit his job?

765
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:51,792
He's right.
I'm going for it.

766
00:31:51,834 --> 00:31:53,458
Sorry. See you later.

767
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:09,959
I knew you'd be here.

768
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,041
I love being outside.

769
00:32:12,083 --> 00:32:14,834
It's so beautiful outside.

770
00:32:14,875 --> 00:32:16,041
You know, I could stand here

771
00:32:16,083 --> 00:32:17,709
and make small talk about
the grass and the trees,

772
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:20,750
but I won't because
I'm too mad at you.

773
00:32:20,792 --> 00:32:23,291
I'm furious at you.

774
00:32:23,333 --> 00:32:25,041
You don't get to tell me
to walk away,

775
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:26,125
and you don't get to tell me

776
00:32:26,166 --> 00:32:27,917
that this is your journey
and not mine.

777
00:32:27,959 --> 00:32:29,208
I'm on this road.

778
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:32,333
I've been on this road
for 56 years, all by myself,

779
00:32:32,375 --> 00:32:34,625
and then you showed up
on my road.

780
00:32:34,667 --> 00:32:35,917
And that day
and every day since

781
00:32:35,959 --> 00:32:37,041
have been the greatest days
of my life,

782
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:39,500
so I am not leaving you.

783
00:32:39,542 --> 00:32:42,583
And i'm--I'm happy to change
diapers and to wipe drool

784
00:32:42,625 --> 00:32:46,041
and to hold your hand, 'cause
I want to take care of you.

785
00:32:46,083 --> 00:32:48,250
I'm honored
to take care of you.

786
00:32:48,291 --> 00:32:52,792
Your last days will be precious,
and I'll Cherish them.

787
00:32:52,834 --> 00:32:54,875
And if you're too far gone
to remember my name,

788
00:32:54,917 --> 00:32:56,959
then I'll remind you.
But you deserve to be loved,

789
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,333
right up until
your very last moment.

790
00:32:59,375 --> 00:33:01,834
You deserve to be
surrounded by love.

791
00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:04,041
You deserve you have the face
of the man who loves you

792
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:05,542
be the last thing
that you see.

793
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:08,041
And I deserve the chance to
love you for as long as I can

794
00:33:08,083 --> 00:33:11,041
or as hard as I can.
So I am not walking away.

795
00:33:11,083 --> 00:33:14,000
Sheldon--
no, I'm not walking away.
I'm on this road.

796
00:33:14,041 --> 00:33:16,041
We are on this road together.

797
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:18,333
I'm not walking away.
Okay.

798
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:20,125
What?
Okay.

799
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:22,083
You're right. I'm wrong.

800
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,000

801
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:36,834

802

891

892
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:35,458
I had a little chat
with Addison, by the way.

893
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,709
She told me
some interesting things.

894

Go home, Sam.
Why didn't you tell me
you and fife broke up?

895
00:37:41,333 --> 00:37:43,834
I-I am not gonna have
this conversation here.
Why didn't you tell me

896
00:37:43,875 --> 00:37:45,417
You have a girlfriend.

I'm staying
and i'm--I'm fighting for you.

903
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:06,417
Now I know I blew us up,

904
00:38:06,458 --> 00:38:08,834
and then I went out
in the world to see if

905
00:38:08,875 --> 00:38:12,041
I could find
something better.

906
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:15,000
But... there isn't
anything better.

907
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:19,792

to wanna be with me now

918

I'm having your baby.
