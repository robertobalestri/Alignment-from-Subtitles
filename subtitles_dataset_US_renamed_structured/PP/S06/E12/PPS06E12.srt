Good morning, Georgia.

00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,709
So it's a big day.
It's a big, big day.

4
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,417
Um, your sisters are coming.

5
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:17,500
So I won't be around
as much as usual

6
00:00:17,542 --> 00:00:19,208
because I'm gonna be
helping your mama.

7
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,041
But I'm gonna make sure that
your aunts and uncles stop by

8
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:23,834
to see you.

9
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:27,417
So if you need anything,

10
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:29,583
you know, just ask, okay?

11
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,000
The babies are okay?

12
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:38,250
I got the nicu on standby.

13
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:40,041
Babies are fine.
Nobody needs to worry.

14
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:41,166
You know,
they're still premature.

15
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,583
Yeah, but multiples
usually are.

16
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:43,792
I mean, they're healthy enough
for delivery now.

17
00:00:43,834 --> 00:00:45,667
They're just not in any rush,
you know?

18
00:00:45,709 --> 00:00:48,041
We don't want to hurry things
along with early babies.

19
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:50,375
So how long?
 Well, she's at 4 centimeters now,

20
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:52,166
and she can't push
until she's at 10,

21
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:53,875
could be in labor
for another day.

22
00:00:53,917 --> 00:00:55,041

23
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:56,166

No, do not put Zoe
on the board.

00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:05,083
Wait.
Don't cross out Hannah.

30
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:06,375

"Hannah and her sisters"?

32
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:09,041

Woody Allen fans in preschool?

34
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:13,250

37
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,792

genetic material.

174
00:06:03,917 --> 00:06:05,250

counteroffers?

The seller doesn't want
any more money,

178
00:06:10,834 --> 00:06:12,166
but another family put in
the same offer.

179
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:14,542
She wants to meet both families
and then decide.

180
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,959

181
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,041

like my death,

00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,375
because they want
to do it now,

183
00:06:19,417 --> 00:06:21,000
but I can't do it now
because Charlotte's in labor.

184
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,166
But if we don't do it now,
we're not gonna have a place

185
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,000
for this enormous family
to live.

186
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:25,667
This is called
a lose-lose.

187
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:27,041
If I'm not there
for the birth of my babies,

188
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,166
Charlotte's gonna string me up
by my toes in the living room.

189
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,583
Our living room
isn't big enough.

190
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,000
Which is why
we need a house, Mason!

191
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,250
Dad, take a deep breath.

192
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,208
You're 10. How'd you get
so sensible?

193
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,500
Is the house near here?

194
00:06:44,542 --> 00:06:46,458
It's not far.

195
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:49,250
All right. Well,
let's go win the house,

196
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:52,875
then we'll go to the hospital
and surprise mama.

197
00:06:52,917 --> 00:06:55,041
Okay, if she yells at me...

198
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,709
I'm blaming you.

199
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,208
You know, you...

200
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,291
You are one lucky lady,
you know that?

201
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,709
You've got your entire life
ahead of you.

202
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:11,500
One big blank slate.

203
00:07:11,542 --> 00:07:13,625
I mean,
I'm kind of envious of you.

204
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,250
You're brave, fearless.

205
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:19,750
I mean, you probably know what
it took me years to figure out.

206
00:07:19,792 --> 00:07:21,917
You gotta live your life
to the fullest.

207
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:24,041
You can't be afraid
to make mistakes.

208
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,041
And I'm trying to do that now.

209
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,625
I...

210
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:29,041
I just hope
it's not too late.

211
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:36,000
Okay.

212
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,125
Good talk.

213
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,333
Thanks.

214
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:41,667
Hey.

215
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:43,083
Did Charlotte have
the babies?

216
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,875
Not even close.

217
00:07:44,917 --> 00:07:46,041
She must be pissed.

218
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,667
You have no idea.

219
00:07:47,709 --> 00:07:48,875
I've been
walking the halls with her,

220
00:07:48,917 --> 00:07:50,041
trying to move
the labor along.

221
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,333
You're hanging out
with her?

222
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,250
Of course.
She's my friend.

223
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,125
Oh.

224
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,917
I just figured being around her
would be hard for you,

225
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,041
because of your history.

226
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,333
Oh.

227
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,041
No.

228
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,875
No, I'm fine.
It's--it's okay.

229
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,041
Good.
Mm.

230
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,291
I'm glad. That's good.

231
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,333
What?

232
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,542
Nothing. I was just--

233
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:13,166
I'm glad to hear
you're doing fine.

234
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,500
So then...

235
00:08:17,542 --> 00:08:18,709
Do you ever think about--

236
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,166
I mean, not right now, but...

237
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,041
Do you want to have kids?

238
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:26,333
Dr. Peterson, you've got
a head lac in curtain two.

239
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:27,542
Be right there.

240
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:28,750
Keep me posted
about Charlotte?

241
00:08:28,792 --> 00:08:31,000
Sure. Yeah.

242
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:38,041
I have never once
heard him say "quiet."

243
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,083
It's always "taciturn."

244
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,417
I caught him reading

245
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,667
a dictionary
in his office once.

246
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:45,750
An expansive vocabulary is
the bedrock of sagacity.

247
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:49,041
Yes, but if you actually
want people to understand you,

248
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,041
you might have to
dumb it down a bit.

249
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,041
Ooh. I like her,
Sheldon.

250
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,417
Where'd you two meet?

251
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,041
At a vending machine.

252
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,625
She was having trouble
with a chocolate bar,

253
00:08:58,667 --> 00:09:00,834
and I assisted her.

254
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,041
That's true.

255
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:06,375
He was very chivalrous
with some loose change.

256
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,375
Thank you.

257
00:09:09,417 --> 00:09:11,000
Oh, looks delicious.

258
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,792
Tell me
what I want to hear.

259
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:16,834
I know this has been
unpleasant for you,

260
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,041
but you are
in the home stretch,

261
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,625
and you've been...
A real trooper

262
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:23,041
these last several months.

263
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,166
I've been a trooper?

264
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,375
Honestly, no.

265
00:09:25,417 --> 00:09:27,000
But I just wanted to say
something nice to you.

266
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,291
You're at 6 centimeters.

267
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:31,041
Ugh. I hate you.

268
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,375
Hey.

269
00:09:32,417 --> 00:09:34,166
Shouldn't you
be getting Henry ready?

270
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,041
I can't leave yet.

271
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:39,041
It's today?

272
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,208
Henry's adoption hearing?

273
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,792
Well, get the hell out.

274
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:44,000
Charlotte--

275
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,417
don't "Charlotte" me.

276
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,208
First of all, Cooper's spawn
aren't actually coming out

277
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,041
until Henry's
college graduation--

278
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,041
Charlotte, you are
having your babies.

279
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,041
You are legally having
your own baby today, too.

280
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:55,750
So go on. Shoo.

281
00:09:55,792 --> 00:09:57,667
All right, but if your labor
starts to progress

282
00:09:57,709 --> 00:09:58,875
more rapidly--

283
00:09:58,917 --> 00:10:00,709
I'll have Jake.

284
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,041
You didn't think you were
both leaving, did you?

285
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,083
Of course not.
I'm just gonna--

286
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:07,291
I'm gonna walk Addison out.

287
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:14,875
So no swings or ice cream
or pictures with the judge.

288
00:10:14,917 --> 00:10:17,458
Well, we'll get the bailiff to
take pictures with the judge,

289
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,041
and there will be swings
and ice cream, just later.

290
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:23,083
Listen, you have no idea
how badly I wanted to be there,

291
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,709
but we can't--
we can't leave Charlotte

292
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,083
with some poor,
unsuspecting doctor.

293
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,375
She'll eat 'em alive.

294
00:10:27,417 --> 00:10:29,166
I know. I just--
I don't know.

295
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,500
I was just really
looking forward to celebrating.

296
00:10:31,542 --> 00:10:33,583
Well, listen,
you and Henry and I

297
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,709
have the rest of our lives
to celebrate.

298
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,375
Your job right now
is to go to court

299
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:39,500
and bring back our son.

300
00:10:39,542 --> 00:10:41,041
Jake...

301
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,792
You just said "our son."

302
00:10:42,834 --> 00:10:43,959
Damn right, I did.

303
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,959
Mm.

304
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,083
Go.

305
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,125
Okay. Okay.

306
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:51,166
Thank you. Mm.

307
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:55,917
I shouldn't be surprised
by his question.

308
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:57,375
I'm a woman.

309
00:10:57,417 --> 00:11:00,000
I have the plumbing.

310
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,375
I love kids.

311
00:11:03,834 --> 00:11:06,709
But what if my body
only makes brainless babies?

312
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,542
I couldn't
live through that again.

313
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:17,125
And even if I was lucky enough
to have a healthy child,

314
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,000
I know things now.

315
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,959
It doesn't matter

316
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,917
how fiercely you love someone.

317
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:25,750
It's not enough.

318
00:11:25,792 --> 00:11:28,041
The world can be terrifying,

319
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,875
and bad things happen that
you're powerless to prevent.

320
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,583
I'm done.

321
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:38,333
I don't want to have
any more babies.

322
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,166
Ugh.

323
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,375
They are unbelievable.

324
00:11:45,417 --> 00:11:46,792
Treating my uterus

325
00:11:46,834 --> 00:11:49,000
like it's some kind
of airport v.I.P. Lounge.

326
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,542
So let's see
what's going on.

327
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:53,583
Oh, I need some
good news, Jake.

328
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:56,041
All right.

329
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,667
And you're at 7 centimeters.

330
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:00,041
Oh, nice.
We're getting closer.

331
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,959
Closer my ass.
Come on. I'm desperate.

332
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,041
Can't you charm 'em out
or somethin'?

333
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,792
They're girls.
Girls like you.

334
00:12:06,834 --> 00:12:08,375
Just get down there and say
whatever it is you say to women

335
00:12:08,417 --> 00:12:10,041
that gets 'em all
in a tizzy.

336
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,667
Your boyfriend's lurking.

337
00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:17,875
Oh, go.

338
00:12:17,917 --> 00:12:19,959
But be back
in 15 minutes.

339
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:24,166
Underneath
that awful exterior,

340
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,875
you really are just a softie,
aren't you?

341
00:12:26,917 --> 00:12:28,208
Shh.

342
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,000
If they hear
you, they'll never mind me.

343
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:34,834
Okay.

344
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:37,041
Look... I need you
on your best behavior, okay?

345
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,041
Look interested,
pay attention,

346
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:41,458
and if the nice lady asks you
any questions at all, you--

347
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,875
no eye rolling,
grunting, or nodding.

348
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,041
Use my words. I got this.

349
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,083
Okay, I know you got it.

350
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,208
It's just--
I really want to win, okay?

351
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,625
We are gonna win.

352
00:12:52,667 --> 00:12:54,792
We're so much better
than the other family.

353
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,041
Oh, I forgot.

354
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,250
What?

355
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:00,542
You need to...

356
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,792
Ohh, mother of god.

357
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,250
This is a bad one.

358
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:25,125
This is, uh, the double platinum
of contractions.

359
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,333
Otherwise,
I'd come help you.

360
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:29,000
I'm sorry.
I should be helping you.

361
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,375
I just--
I needed a place to hide.

362
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:33,041
I can't be crying
in the middle of the hospital.

363
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:36,333
Oh, it's my hospital.
You can do whatever the...

364
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,709
Oh! You can do whatever
you damn well please.

365
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,917
Oh.

366
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:41,917
It should be over
in the next millennium,

367
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:44,792
and I'll ask you
what's wrong.

368
00:13:44,834 --> 00:13:46,792
Oh, don't worry about me.
I'm fine. I'm okay.

369
00:13:46,834 --> 00:13:48,166
I just--i just can't...

370
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:53,166
I just can't stop crying.

371
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:56,792
Why won't it stop?

372
00:13:56,834 --> 00:14:00,250
I've been asking my uterus
that same thing, sister.

373
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,792
Aah!

374
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,542
Hello there, young man.

375
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:11,959
You must be Henry.

376
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,917
He is, your honor.

377
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:15,625
And this is
Dr. Addison Forbes Montgomery,

378
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:17,250
the adoptive parent.

379
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,041
Oh, I see you work at
St. ambrose, Dr. Montgomery.

380
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,834
That's right.

381
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,792
But not so much that it would
be a problem for Henry.

382
00:14:25,834 --> 00:14:28,166
I--sorry. I'm...
I'm a little nervous.

383
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,417
No need.

384
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:33,375
Birth mother signed away
parental rights.

385
00:14:33,417 --> 00:14:36,000
Home visits completed.

386
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,375
What's going on?

387
00:14:41,417 --> 00:14:42,792
Your honor?

388
00:14:42,834 --> 00:14:44,458
Your social worker
Mildred clemons

389
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,041
just faxed this letter.

390
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,959
It seems
she has some concerns.

391
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,875
Wh-what concerns?
I don't understand.

392
00:14:49,917 --> 00:14:51,041
I'm sorry, Dr. Montgomery.

393
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,083
I can't finalize
Henry's adoption today.

394
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,083
I'm ordering
further evaluation.

395
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:58,500
We'll set another court date,
and I'll make a ruling then.

396
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:02,417
Wh-wh-what does that mean?
What just happened?

397
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:03,625
I don't know.

398
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:05,625
Normally this hearing
is a formality.

399
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:07,834
Did something happen
with Mildred?

400
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,917
No, I haven't seen her
in months.

401
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:12,041
Was there anything unusual
about her last visit?

402
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:15,583
No, no. She--she just
met with...

403
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:16,792
Jake.

404
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:18,041
Okay.

405
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,291
I'll talk to the judge

406
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,917
and try and find out
exactly what's going on

407
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,041
and how we should proceed.

408
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,458
Wait, wait.
Is there a chance--

409
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,625
I mean, could I...

410
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:27,667
Could I lose Henry?

411
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:36,709
Try not to grow up
too fast, okay?

412
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,667
Because little girls
who grow up too fast

413
00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:41,250
end up running off with
their college professors,

414
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:44,458
which you and I both know
is entirely inappropriate.

415
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,041
And we also know that

416
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,041
cutting off communication
with your father

417
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,417
because he showed
a little concern

418
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:53,458
over your emotional well-being
is, well...

419
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,458
Let's just say
I'll be recommending

420
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,041
a good private school
to your mom and dad--

421
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:02,083
one with only female teachers,
possibly a convent.

422
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,250
It really is
such an amazing home.

423
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,333
I just want whoever
lives here next

424
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,333
to Cherish this place
like we did,

425
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,750
respect its history.

426
00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:11,875
Yeah.
History's
my favorite subject.

427
00:16:11,917 --> 00:16:14,041
Do you know what started
world war I?

428
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,375
Uh...

429
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:19,792
The assassination
of archduke ferdinand.

430
00:16:19,834 --> 00:16:22,166
And his wife Sophie.
Oh.

431
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:23,750
You are so darling.

432
00:16:23,792 --> 00:16:25,542
Hello?

433
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,166
Yoo-hoo.
Hi.

434
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:29,792
Dan and Darlene meyer.

435
00:16:29,834 --> 00:16:31,041
I know we're early,

436
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,417
but we got a call to serve food
at the mission later,

437
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,834
and we just didn't want
to miss this opportunity.

438
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,000
We love this house.
Ohh.

439
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:38,917
Well, this is Dr. Freedman
and his son Mason.

440
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,208
Hi. Cooper Freedman.
Hi.

441
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,834
Hi, Mason.
Hi.

442
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,625
They're the other family
that's bidding on the house.

443
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:45,083
Nice to meet you...
Oh.

444
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,792
And your pie.

445
00:16:46,834 --> 00:16:48,375
Apple pie?

446
00:16:48,417 --> 00:16:49,417
Mm-hmm.

447
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:50,625
Yeah, well...

448
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:53,041
It's not blueberry,
but, you know...

449
00:16:54,667 --> 00:16:56,417
Um...

450
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,208
So you're a doctor?

451
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,166
Yes. Dr. Freedman.

452
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,291
Pediatrician.
Mm.

453
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:05,458
I just love helping children.
It's a calling, really.

454
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,375
Yeah, I was--i was premed.

455
00:17:07,417 --> 00:17:08,583
Oh.

456
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,000
Yeah, but then I met Dan

457
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:11,667
when we were volunteering
at a women's shelter.

458
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:13,959
And I don't know.

459
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,542
Four years of medical school
and internship, residency--

460
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,250
it just felt like
it would take too long

461
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:20,458
to actually make a difference
in the world.
Mm.

462
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,542
You know?
Yeah.

463
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,041
Well, that is so lovely.

464
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,250
Walter and I like to go

465
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,208
to children's hospital
on the weekends

466
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,458
and visit with the kids.

467
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,041
So inspiring.

468
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,959
We help out
with their annual fund-raiser.
Mm-hmm.

469
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,041
Oh. Oh!

470
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,458
You are
that Dan and Darlene meyer?

471
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,667
That's us.
Guilty.

472
00:17:37,709 --> 00:17:39,792
Oh. I have seen your names
on the program.

473
00:17:39,834 --> 00:17:41,041

- Yeah.

Well... Who would
like a piece of pie?

476
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,667
- Thank you. Oh, I would.
- Yes.

477
00:17:47,709 --> 00:17:51,709
You know the one good thing
about dying of cancer?

478
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,250
I don't have to worry
about sunscreen anymore.

479
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,834

480

00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,917
to get a present
for the cooplets,

540
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:37,792
and, um, the owner
of the bookstore

541
00:20:37,834 --> 00:20:39,250
was this
very attractive man.

542
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:41,041
And, uh, he recognized me
from my book.

543
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,875
Okay. I wrote a book.

544
00:20:42,917 --> 00:20:44,583
I don't get recognized
very much, but, uh,

545
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:45,792
it never gets old.

546
00:20:45,834 --> 00:20:47,291
Right? So he recognized me,

547
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:50,458
and then he flirted with me.

548
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,875
Uh-oh.

549
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,625
And i--
I flirted--

550
00:20:53,667 --> 00:20:55,041
I flirted back a little.

551
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,375
And then he asked me

552
00:20:56,417 --> 00:20:59,000
what happened
to the guy in the book.

553
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,291
Pete.

554
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:01,875
And, Sam...

555
00:21:01,917 --> 00:21:04,959
I forgot all about him.

556
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,417
For the three or four minutes
I was flirting with this guy,

557
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,542
I just--i forgot
Pete ever existed.

558
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:10,959
I forgot he was dead.

559
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,542
I-I forgot--i forgot him.

560
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,250
Well, that's normal.
Right?

561
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,041
Isn't that a normal step
in the grieving process?

562
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:18,667
Yeah. Yeah.
But it was just so...

563
00:21:18,709 --> 00:21:19,959
I mean, look,

564
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,125
Charlotte is having
her babies today,

565
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:22,542
and I was so happy
for her.

566
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,041
I am. I'm so happy
for her and Cooper.

567
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,250
Mm-hmm.

568
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:26,667
But then I go
to this bookstore,

569
00:21:26,709 --> 00:21:29,291
and I see my book about
this super awesome time

570
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:31,959
when a lady cut my baby
out of my belly.

571
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,041
And then I remember
Pete is dead.

572
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:35,333
And then I see you
and Stephanie,

573
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:37,000
and you guys
are so sweet together.

574
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,917
And then Sheldon
has found Miranda,

575
00:21:38,959 --> 00:21:40,291
and she's just lovely
with him.

576
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,959
And then Addison and Jake,
and it--everybody's living.

577
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,667
And I just keep having
these waves

578
00:21:44,709 --> 00:21:46,959
where I start to cry
and I can't stop.

579
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And--and so I was
at this bookstore

580
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,375
with this attractive man.

581
00:21:50,417 --> 00:21:53,667
And I had this moment, Sam,
where I just...

582
00:21:53,709 --> 00:21:56,250
I just knew...

583
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:59,333
I'm never gonna have
another child.

584
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:01,792
My whole experience
of having a child

585
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:03,166
is Katie stealing my baby.

586
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:05,041
I'm never
gonna get married again.

587
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:08,208
My entire experience
of marriage was Pete,

588
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,208
and that was so... I mean,
some of it was good,

589
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,417
but most of it
was pretty painful.

590
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:15,417
So that entire part
of my life, it's...

591
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:16,625
It's done.

592
00:22:16,667 --> 00:22:18,041
And I want to forget him.

593
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:20,041
I was angry
that I remembered him.

594
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:23,542
Because when I remember him,
it feels like I'm dying, too.

595
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:25,709
So this is it.

596
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,834

This is who I am.

Jake was trying

00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:45,166
He's a good man. He would
never hurt anyone, Mildred.

he threatened to kill.

much-older college professor,

666

and he...
He just got upset.

667
00:24:54,792 --> 00:24:58,041
He was a good deal more
than upset.

If this was an issue,

669

why didn't you
say something sooner?

670

Seeing you with Henry

671
00:25:05,834 --> 00:25:08,041
is what we dream about
when we place children,

672
00:25:08,083 --> 00:25:10,041
so I approved the adoption.

673
00:25:10,083 --> 00:25:11,291
But after meeting Dr. Reilly,

674
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:14,041
I thought I could get past
my concerns.

675
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:15,834
I have to be dispassionate

676
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:17,709
and consider
what's best for the child.

677
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,041
I am what's best
for Henry.

678
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:20,834
And if Henry were living
with you alone,

679
00:25:20,875 --> 00:25:23,625
I wouldn't have
an objection.

680
00:25:23,667 --> 00:25:26,041
Please.

681
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:27,291
I can't lose my son.

682
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:29,041
I'm sorry, Dr. Montgomery.

683
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:31,542
I've already made
my recommendation.

684
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:34,208
Now it's up to the judge.

685
00:25:46,667 --> 00:25:47,959
"And the brave prince

686
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,125
"married the beautiful
fairy Princess,

687
00:25:49,166 --> 00:25:51,834
and together, they lived
happily ever after."

688
00:25:53,083 --> 00:25:54,667
I know.

689
00:25:54,709 --> 00:25:56,250
I should've read the blue one
about the trains.

690
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,333
Fairy tales are just...

691
00:25:59,375 --> 00:26:02,041
Well, they're just stupid,
you know?

692
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:04,166
And people should not
read them to their children.

693
00:26:04,208 --> 00:26:06,625
It sets them up
for false expectations.

694
00:26:06,667 --> 00:26:10,041
It makes them think
that happily ever after

695
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:11,250
is the end of the story.

696
00:26:11,291 --> 00:26:13,417
It's not like that,
you know?

697
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:16,083
Real relationship stories...

698
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:17,917
Are messy.

699
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:21,041
Real relationship stories
sometimes have a dead prince

700
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:25,417
and a grieving Princess
who sobs in public.

701
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:28,166
And they don't end.

702
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:30,041
Sam says there's no ending,

703
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:32,000
and I choose to believe him

704
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:35,959
because a dead prince
can't be the ending.

705
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:45,333
God, you are so tiny.

706
00:26:45,375 --> 00:26:49,625

what I'm talking about.

you never have a dead prince.

00:27:12,959 --> 00:27:15,500
Oh, I can't. I need Coop.
Amelia...

718
00:27:15,542 --> 00:27:16,709
I know.

719
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:17,917
They're coming.
I know.

720
00:27:19,083 --> 00:27:21,000
Oh, where the freakin' hell
is my husband?

721
00:27:21,041 --> 00:27:22,166
I'll find him.

722
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:24,792
Oh.

723
00:27:24,834 --> 00:27:27,125
Right from that first day,
I knew that Darlene

724
00:27:27,166 --> 00:27:29,792
was the woman I wanted to
spend the rest of my life with.

725
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:32,542
Dr. Freedman,
where did you meet your wife?

726
00:27:32,583 --> 00:27:34,125
Wasn't it on a web site?

727
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:35,750
No.

728
00:27:35,792 --> 00:27:37,083
No, we met
at St. ambrose hospital,

729
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:39,333
where she is chief of staff.

730
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:41,125
Hmm,
that can't be easy.

731
00:27:41,166 --> 00:27:43,000
There's so much bureaucracy
in the practice of medicine.

732
00:27:43,041 --> 00:27:44,750
Yeah, and price gouging.

733
00:27:44,792 --> 00:27:46,041
Price gouging?

734
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:47,291
Well, I'm sorry, Dr. Freedman.

735
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:49,041
Most people can't afford
any kind of medical care.

736
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:51,208
Well, I treat my patients
regardless.

737
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:53,208
But you don't practice
for free, right?

738
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,500
Well, I save children.

739
00:27:54,542 --> 00:27:56,125
Uh, would you like

740
00:27:56,166 --> 00:27:57,542
to hear about the schools
in the neighborhood?

741
00:27:57,583 --> 00:27:59,834
Amelia.

742
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:02,000
Okay. We're on our way.
We gotta go.

743
00:28:02,041 --> 00:28:03,125
But we're totally winning.

744
00:28:03,166 --> 00:28:04,542
Sorry.

745
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:06,625
Um, look, I...

746
00:28:06,667 --> 00:28:08,959
Really want to buy this house
for my wife as a surprise

747
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,041
because I love it,
she would love it.

748
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:13,125
And she's been through so much
and she really deserves it.

749
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:15,417
And Mason and my girls, they
could have a happy life here.

750
00:28:15,458 --> 00:28:17,542
But as much as I want to live
in this amazing house,

751
00:28:17,583 --> 00:28:19,041
I cannot be here right now,

752
00:28:19,083 --> 00:28:22,458
um, because my wife
is in labor with triplets,

753
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,583
and I have to be there
with her, okay?

754
00:28:24,625 --> 00:28:26,375
So I mean,
family is everything.

755
00:28:26,417 --> 00:28:28,375
If we end up living
in a tent by the stream,

756
00:28:28,417 --> 00:28:30,959
as long as we're together,
it's gonna be fine.

757
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,917
So it was nice to meet you...
But we gotta go.

758
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,542
Hey there. You feel like
having some babies?

759
00:28:41,583 --> 00:28:43,959
No. Not without Cooper.
He's on his way.

760
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,041
So how'd it go?

761
00:28:45,083 --> 00:28:46,959
Was it, uh,
was it amazing?

762
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,041
It was fine.

763
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:50,000
You don't look like
it was fine.

764
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:51,625
Well, I have two babies
to deliver,

765
00:28:51,667 --> 00:28:53,917
so if you could move...

766
00:28:53,959 --> 00:28:56,583
Okay.

767
00:28:56,625 --> 00:28:59,041
Oh, yeah. These babies aren't
waiting for their daddy.

768
00:28:59,083 --> 00:29:00,542
I need Cooper.
Well, you're gonna feel better

769
00:29:00,583 --> 00:29:02,041
once you start pushing,
Charlotte.

770
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:03,041
No, I can't do it
without him.

771
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:05,709
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
Totally explain.

772
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,083
Shut the hell up
and hold my hand.

773
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:08,375
Thank god.
My hand is numb.

774
00:29:08,417 --> 00:29:10,625
All righty. Here we go.
Give me a push.

775
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:12,125
Aah!

776
00:29:13,875 --> 00:29:15,417
Charlotte's delivering, huh?

777
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:17,208
Finally.

778
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:21,041
She's been running Stephanie
ragged all day.

779
00:29:23,291 --> 00:29:25,542
So you and Stephanie
are back on, huh?

780
00:29:25,583 --> 00:29:26,750
Yeah.

781
00:29:26,792 --> 00:29:30,041
Yeah. Well, good.
Good for you.

782
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:31,667
I'm seeing someone, too.

783
00:29:31,709 --> 00:29:33,083
Her name is Miranda.

784
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:35,041
Oh, that's great, Sheldon.

785
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:36,125
Yeah.

786
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:38,250
All right.

787
00:29:38,291 --> 00:29:40,959
I met her at radiation.

788
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,417
I did
eight weeks of treatment.

789
00:29:42,458 --> 00:29:43,834
Now I gotta wait
another six months

790
00:29:43,875 --> 00:29:46,333
before I know if it works,
but, uh...

791
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:48,875
I'm hopeful.

792
00:29:48,917 --> 00:29:50,875
How you feeling?

793
00:29:50,917 --> 00:29:54,000
Pretty good for a guy whose
prostate glows in the dark.

794
00:29:57,625 --> 00:29:59,500
Well, I'm glad
you got treatment.

795
00:29:59,542 --> 00:30:01,500
Yeah, I have a friend
who was a real pain in the ass

796
00:30:01,542 --> 00:30:03,041
about it.

797
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:06,542
So anyway, uh...

798
00:30:06,583 --> 00:30:08,000
Thank you.

799
00:30:12,083 --> 00:30:14,000
Ohh.

800
00:30:14,041 --> 00:30:15,250
Okay, Charlotte,
I need you to push.

801
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:19,500
Good.
Almost there.

802
00:30:19,542 --> 00:30:21,000
Get them out!

803
00:30:21,041 --> 00:30:22,041
You're so close.

804
00:30:22,083 --> 00:30:23,458
Oh, don't tell me I'm close

805
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,792
when I still got
two babies inside me.

806
00:30:25,834 --> 00:30:27,875
All right, Charlotte,
I need you to keep pushing.

807
00:30:27,917 --> 00:30:29,333
Now focus.

808
00:30:29,375 --> 00:30:32,750
Aah!

809
00:30:32,792 --> 00:30:34,750
Good.

810
00:30:37,166 --> 00:30:39,041
Ohh. Ohh.

811
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:43,542
She's crying.

812
00:30:43,583 --> 00:30:46,041
She's okay?

813
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:47,208
She's perfect.

814
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,125
If this is, uh,

815
00:30:59,166 --> 00:31:00,875
if this is too hard
for you...

816
00:31:00,917 --> 00:31:02,417
No.

817
00:31:02,458 --> 00:31:03,792
It's amazing.

818
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:06,125
Aah!

819
00:31:06,166 --> 00:31:07,208
Ohh!

820
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:09,166
Something's not right.

821
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:10,375
Addison, talk to me.

822
00:31:10,417 --> 00:31:11,458
I can't feel the head.

823
00:31:13,083 --> 00:31:14,375
Is she in breech?

824
00:31:14,417 --> 00:31:16,583
No, she's not upside down.
She's sideways.

825
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:18,041
Can you just do
a c-section?

826
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:19,750
It is an option,
but I still feel like

827
00:31:19,792 --> 00:31:21,875
I can deliver vaginally.

828
00:31:21,917 --> 00:31:23,458
There are significant risks.
The baby is transverse.

829
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,250
Yeah, but there's risks
with any procedure,

830
00:31:25,291 --> 00:31:26,875
including c-section.

831
00:31:26,917 --> 00:31:28,041
Look, Charlotte, your body's
been through enough trauma

832
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:29,250
and so have the babies.

833
00:31:29,291 --> 00:31:30,458
I still think I can deliver

834
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,041
by doing
an internal podalic version.

835
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:33,333
What the hell is that?

836
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:34,750
She rotates the baby
until she can grab a foot,

837
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:36,417
and then she delivers her
as a breech.

838
00:31:36,458 --> 00:31:38,792
Wait. Is that... I mean,
can you even do that?

839
00:31:38,834 --> 00:31:40,375
Yes, Cooper. I can do it.
And is it safe?

840
00:31:40,417 --> 00:31:42,166
Cooper, you know they couldn't
be in better hands.

841
00:31:42,208 --> 00:31:44,291
Charlotte, it's easier
on your body than surgery

842
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:47,291
and it won't take very long,
but it's gonna hurt like hell.

843
00:31:47,333 --> 00:31:49,208
Okay. Just get on with it.

844
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,625
Yeah? All right.
Let's get her ready.

845
00:31:50,667 --> 00:31:51,834
Okay.
I'll stabilize her legs.

846
00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:53,458
Okay, now you can't push
until I tell you,

847
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,041
but you can scream.

848
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:56,041
And you can squeeze.

849
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:57,834
All right?
So on the count of three.

850
00:31:57,875 --> 00:31:59,041
Mm-hmm.

851
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,041
One, two, three.

852
00:32:01,083 --> 00:32:02,041
Squeeze.

853
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,166
Oh, god!

854
00:32:06,208 --> 00:32:09,041
Ohh!

855
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,041
Aah!

856
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:15,333
Aah!
Almost there.

857
00:32:15,375 --> 00:32:16,458
Almost there.

858
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,041
I can't. It's too much.

859
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:19,500
Okay, listen to me.
Listen to me.

860
00:32:19,542 --> 00:32:21,041
You can do this, okay?
You can.

861
00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:22,959
I just want it to be over.
It's about to be over.

862
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,959
You are so strong.

863
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,125
Our girls are gonna be
just like you.

864
00:32:26,166 --> 00:32:27,709
So come on. You gotta
do this right now.

865
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,083
Your little girl
wants to meet you, okay?

866
00:32:29,125 --> 00:32:30,875
Okay. Okay. I've got
the baby turned.

867
00:32:30,917 --> 00:32:32,250
Just give me a push now.

868
00:32:32,291 --> 00:32:34,333
Aah!

869
00:32:34,375 --> 00:32:36,083
Good. All right. Stop.
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.

870
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:38,333
No more pushing.
No more pushing.
Is that good?

871
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:40,542
She's got the body, okay?
But the head is still inside.

872
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:41,875
Just give her a minute,
okay?

873
00:32:41,917 --> 00:32:43,250
Please. I'm so exhausted.

874
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:45,792
I know. I know you are,
but you're almost there.

875
00:32:45,834 --> 00:32:47,750
Just a few more seconds.

876
00:32:47,792 --> 00:32:49,041
Okay, now. Push.

877
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:51,083
Aah!

878
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:54,041
Okay. Okay. Good.
I got her.

879
00:32:55,291 --> 00:32:57,041
Oh, god.

880
00:32:57,083 --> 00:32:58,875
Hi.

881
00:32:58,917 --> 00:32:59,875
Hi, baby.

882
00:32:59,917 --> 00:33:01,125
Let me see you.

883
00:33:01,166 --> 00:33:02,709
You want to cut
the cord, Cooper?
Yeah.

884
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,875
Hey, she's got your eyes.

885
00:33:04,917 --> 00:33:07,125
Hi, sweetheart.

886
00:33:07,166 --> 00:33:08,333
Hi. Hi.

887
00:33:08,375 --> 00:33:09,750
Hi, baby girl.

888
00:33:11,083 --> 00:33:12,458
Okay.

889
00:33:14,417 --> 00:33:15,542
Okay.
Let me take her away now.

890
00:33:15,583 --> 00:33:17,166
Oh.
There we go.

891
00:33:17,208 --> 00:33:18,375
She wants her mama.

892
00:33:18,417 --> 00:33:19,834
You got her?

893
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:21,041
Got her.

894
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:34,417
Hey.

895
00:33:34,458 --> 00:33:36,750
So what happened in court?

896
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:40,125
Mildred happened.

897
00:33:40,166 --> 00:33:43,333
At the last minute,
she decided she couldn't...

898
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:48,834
She doesn't feel right
about the adoption.

899
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:51,041
What? I-I thought the hearing
was just a formality.

900
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:52,583
Not anymore.

901
00:33:52,625 --> 00:33:54,250
The judge decided he wanted
to do further evaluation,

902
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:57,208
and then
he's going to decide...

903
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:59,542
Whether or not
I get to keep my son.

904
00:33:59,583 --> 00:34:02,834
I-I don't understand.
Why would she...

905
00:34:04,458 --> 00:34:06,583
Oh, god. No.

906
00:34:06,625 --> 00:34:08,417
It's--it's me? My arrest.

907
00:34:08,458 --> 00:34:10,041
And the thing with Angela.

908
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:12,041
Oh, Addison.

909
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:14,959
I'm so...

910
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,625
I'm so sorry. Hey.

911
00:34:17,667 --> 00:34:19,583
Don't. Okay? I just--
right now, I-I can't.

912
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:22,250
I just--i know that this is--
this is not your fault.

913
00:34:22,291 --> 00:34:24,291
I know that, but...

914
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:28,625
The judge could take Henry
from me, and...

915
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:30,709
I can't.

916
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:41,250
Charlotte had the babies.

917
00:34:41,291 --> 00:34:43,458
That's great.
Is everybody okay?

918
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,583
They're amazing.

919
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:48,834
They're perfect.

920
00:34:48,875 --> 00:34:50,667
Hey, hey, hey. Wh-what's--
what's going on?

921
00:34:50,709 --> 00:34:52,291
Yes.
What?

922
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:55,583
The answer to your question
is yes, I want babies.

923
00:34:55,625 --> 00:34:57,083
I want a lot of babies.

924
00:34:57,125 --> 00:34:59,208
And I'm really scared
to want babies,

925
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:01,667
so I-I told myself
that I didn't, but I do.

926
00:35:03,542 --> 00:35:06,208
Because it's a miracle.

927
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:08,041
And I really...

928
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:09,834
I really a need miracle.

929
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:13,417
So, yes, someday I want
to have babies with you.

930
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:15,083
Someday.

931
00:35:16,667 --> 00:35:18,500
If we get that far.

932
00:35:18,542 --> 00:35:20,041
We'll get that far.

933
00:35:28,291 --> 00:35:29,625
You came back
for your basket.

934
00:35:29,667 --> 00:35:30,834
I came back for my basket.

935
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:32,000
I'm glad.

936
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:36,542
Oh...

937
00:35:38,542 --> 00:35:39,709
Wow.

938
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,041
I added some extra books--
uh, no charge--

939
00:35:41,083 --> 00:35:42,291
just to fill it out
a little bit.

940
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:44,667
And then there's some books
every child should have,

941
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:46,166
so I threw those in, too.

942
00:35:46,208 --> 00:35:49,041
You--you didn't have to--
it's--it's beautiful. Thanks.

943
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:50,792
I felt bad.

944
00:35:50,834 --> 00:35:52,458
I made you feel sad,
and I didn't mean to.

945
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,917
No, no, no,
it wasn't you.

946
00:35:53,959 --> 00:35:55,125
It was just...

947
00:35:55,166 --> 00:35:56,750
It was me.

948
00:35:58,041 --> 00:35:59,166
Okay.

949
00:35:59,208 --> 00:36:02,750
You were actually
being really kind.

950
00:36:02,792 --> 00:36:05,166
So would you like to get
a cup of coffee sometime

951
00:36:05,208 --> 00:36:06,750
or--or a drink?

952
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,375
I can't go out with you.

953
00:36:10,417 --> 00:36:11,709
I don't want to.

954
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,041
Okay.

955
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:14,417
I mean, no, it's not you.
I mean, you're lovely.

956
00:36:14,458 --> 00:36:16,041
And I think if I was gonna
go out with anybody,

957
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:17,583
it would probably be you,
but--

958
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:19,041
but?

959
00:36:19,083 --> 00:36:22,208
But i'm--
I'm trying to be okay

960
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:25,041
with just me right now.

961
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:26,959
And I don't wanna
mess that up

962
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,041
or cloud it or--
I understand.

963
00:36:29,083 --> 00:36:30,083
You do?

964
00:36:30,125 --> 00:36:31,417
I read your book five times.

965
00:36:33,083 --> 00:36:36,041
And you're a very good writer,
so I understand perfectly.

966
00:36:36,083 --> 00:36:37,875
We'll be friends.

967
00:36:39,083 --> 00:36:40,208
All right.

968
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:42,041
Yeah, we'll be friends.

969
00:36:43,458 --> 00:36:45,875
And thank you.

970
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:54,041
You know what?

971
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:56,959
I'm gonna write another book.
I just decided.

972
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,667
And you helped me decide,
so thank you.

973
00:36:58,709 --> 00:37:00,041
Well, congratulations.

974
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:02,208
What are you gonna call it?
What?

975
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,375
The book.
What's its title?

976
00:37:04,417 --> 00:37:06,542
Oh. Uh, I don't know yet.

977
00:37:06,583 --> 00:37:10,542
It's, uh,
it's a work in progress.

978
00:37:10,583 --> 00:37:11,834
Well, good luck.

979
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:21,083
Thank you.

980
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:23,083
Judge Harris, my name
is Dr. Jake Reilly.

981
00:37:23,125 --> 00:37:24,291
I'm engaged to--

982
00:37:24,333 --> 00:37:26,041
Dr. Addison Forbes Montgomery.

983
00:37:26,083 --> 00:37:27,875
I know who you are.

984
00:37:27,917 --> 00:37:29,458
And I know why you're here.

985
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,291
But I haven't made
my decision.

986
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:34,792
You can't decide what's best
for Henry without the facts.

987
00:37:34,834 --> 00:37:37,041
I have them,
in a nice big red file.

988
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:40,625
That's not the whole story.

989
00:37:40,667 --> 00:37:43,333
You can only get that
from me.

990
00:37:45,667 --> 00:37:46,875
30 seconds.

991
00:37:46,917 --> 00:37:50,500
Lily, my wife, my--
my late wife, was an addict.

992
00:37:50,542 --> 00:37:53,875
She had a daughter--Angela--
who became our daughter.

993
00:37:53,917 --> 00:37:57,250
Lily's dealer was
as close to the devil as...

994
00:37:57,291 --> 00:37:59,291
He would kill for money.
He would--

995
00:37:59,333 --> 00:38:01,041
he would kill for nothing.

996
00:38:01,083 --> 00:38:03,208
And I had to protect
my family,

997
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:05,834
my... my child.

998
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:07,625
And all these years later?

999
00:38:07,667 --> 00:38:10,041
I'm still protecting
my child.

1000
00:38:10,083 --> 00:38:13,041
When you have a kid,
it's--it's for life.

1001
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:14,750
Doesn't matter
how old they are.

1002
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:17,125
I was trying
to protect Angela,

1003
00:38:17,166 --> 00:38:20,667
and I would do the same
for Henry.

1004
00:38:20,709 --> 00:38:23,500
Consider yourself heard.

1005
00:38:26,291 --> 00:38:28,875
I'll leave her.

1006
00:38:28,917 --> 00:38:31,458
Addison loves that baby.
She...

1007
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,250
She loves Henry more than
anything in the world,

1008
00:38:33,291 --> 00:38:35,083
and I love her
maybe even more than that,

1009
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:37,041
so if you're going to
break them apart,

1010
00:38:37,083 --> 00:38:38,458
then I'll leave her.

1011
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,041
I'll walk away.

1012
00:38:40,083 --> 00:38:42,041
But they
need to be together.

1013
00:38:42,083 --> 00:38:44,041

Oh!

1041
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:47,667

What house?

1044
00:39:50,083 --> 00:39:52,041
The perfect house.
Dad wanted to surprise you,

1045
00:39:52,083 --> 00:39:54,041
but he didn't think
we would get it.

1046
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:55,667
So we had to beat
the other couple

1047
00:39:55,709 --> 00:39:58,250
even though they were perfect,
and it's ours.

1048
00:39:58,291 --> 00:40:00,041
Oh, my god.
I bought a house.

1049
00:40:00,083 --> 00:40:01,458
We got a house.

1050
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,250
I am sorry to break up
the party,

1051
00:40:03,291 --> 00:40:06,417
but we've gotta take the babies
back to the nursery now.

1052
00:40:06,458 --> 00:40:08,041
Oh, can't we have 'em
just a little longer?

1053
00:40:08,083 --> 00:40:10,834
Preemies need to be monitored.

1054
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:13,375
And you'll see them again
first thing in the morning.

1055
00:40:13,417 --> 00:40:15,041
They need to sleep right now,

1056
00:40:15,083 --> 00:40:17,458
as do I.

1057
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:21,166
We bought a house.

1058
00:40:21,208 --> 00:40:22,583
Well done, daddy.

1059
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:26,208
Well, this has been
a good day.

1060
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:30,417
Your mom and dad
officially have four kids.

1061
00:40:30,458 --> 00:40:33,041
I only want one.

1062
00:40:33,083 --> 00:40:35,625
I only want Henry.

1063
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:39,041
I can't blame Mildred for
wanting what's best for Henry.

1064
00:40:39,083 --> 00:40:41,458
We're both
on the same side there.

1065
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,291
But she's wrong

1066
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:46,834
about Jake.

1067
00:40:46,875 --> 00:40:49,834
Jake is...

1068
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:53,458
The best man
I've ever known.

1069
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,083
He...

1070
00:40:55,125 --> 00:40:57,417
Is the man of my dreams.

1071
00:40:57,458 --> 00:41:00,917
Oh, yes, little one. Yeah.
