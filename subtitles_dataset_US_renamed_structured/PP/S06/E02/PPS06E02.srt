I am so glad
you guys are here.

24
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:40,542
And thank you for hosting.

25
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:42,083
Oh, of course.

26
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:44,041
I would've done it at my place,
but, uh,

27
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:46,291
the realtor has a bunch of
people lined up to see the house

28
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:47,917
since I dropped the price, so...

29
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:50,083
Yeah, should you... I mean,
are you sure you don't wanna

30
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:51,709
just, you know... take a minute

31
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,417
before you make, uh,
any big changes?

32
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:54,667
I mean, just take a second
to take a deep breath.

33
00:01:54,709 --> 00:01:57,041
No, no, no. Lucas and I need
to move forward.

34
00:01:57,083 --> 00:02:00,542
And I'm gonna look at some
houses tomorrow, so...

35
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,291
Well...
It's a good turnout.

36
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,667
Yeah.
Yes.

37
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:06,917
Yeah.
Yeah.

38
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:09,333
I think Pete would've
liked it.

39
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:12,917
I mean, who knows, right?

40
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,500
This is what
the will said he wanted.

41
00:02:15,542 --> 00:02:18,667
Yeah, he went to
a funeral once in Bali, I guess,

42
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:20,166
and the whole village
came out to celebrate.

43
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,375
You know, like, dressed up
like it was a party,

44
00:02:22,417 --> 00:02:24,041
told stories and sang and...

45
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:25,959
Wait, wait.
Are we gonna have to sing?

46
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:28,041
- The--he did request singing, yes.
- Mm-hmm.

47
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:29,125
Mm-hmm.
That's why we have
the karaoke machine.

48
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:30,750
Perhaps you could
get it started?

49
00:02:30,792 --> 00:02:33,375
Ohh. Right.
I'm gonna need a few drinks.

50
00:02:33,417 --> 00:02:34,625
Yes.
Would you like one?

51
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:37,041
No. No, no, but I have
something for you.

52
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:38,208
Uh... yeah.

53
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,959
Um...

54
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:46,166
Pete got this in India
a few years ago.

55
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,917
He was, uh, there working
with a spiritual leader

56
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,417
who--who hugs people.
That's her thing.

57
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,333
She's hugged, like,
30 million followers.

58
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:53,500
She must be exhausted.

59
00:02:53,542 --> 00:02:55,500
And this..

60
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,959
Is for you.

61
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:03,041
Oh.
Wear it in good health.

62
00:03:07,792 --> 00:03:10,000
I'll be--I'll be right back.

63
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,166
Oh. He woke up?

64
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:15,750
Yeah, he was just hanging out
in his crib, gummin' a rattle.

65
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:17,250
Aw. Does he need
his diaper changed?

66
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:18,625
Uh, already took care of it.

67
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:21,041
Ohh. Good.
Does that feel good?

68
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,834
I thought you said
Violet would be sad.

69
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,125
She is sad.

70
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:27,458
There's many different ways
to honor someone's memory.

71
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,750
Yeah, but... this is weird.

72
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,041
Yeah.

73
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:34,041
I mean, not as weird
as watching the cremation.

74
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,667
And the kids couldn't
be more bored.

75
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:37,458
Why don't I take them
to your place for a while?

76
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,875
I don't do too well

77
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:41,041
in situations where people
are feeling one way

78
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:42,458
and pretending to feel another.

79
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,375
I tend to say
inappropriate things.

80
00:03:44,417 --> 00:03:45,583
And shoot up.

81
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:48,000
So...

82
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,083
If anybody has any drugs...

83
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:51,083
Okay, yeah.
Told you.

84
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,667
Inappropriate things.
Yeah, go--go take 'em.

85
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:53,875
All right, I'm just gonna get
Henry's bottle.

86
00:03:53,917 --> 00:03:58,000
Karaoke? For real?

87
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,667
So then I joined
this running group,

88
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:07,834
figuring that would be a great
way to meet people, but...

89
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,041
But?

90
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,792
Um, I look around and...

91
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:14,333
And I see all these people--

92
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,917
at work, in my neighborhood.

93
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,291
I mean, they just...

94
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:22,417
I--they just seem like
average Joes,

95
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:23,625
you know?
Yeah.

96
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:24,834
They don't seem to have
superpowers

97
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,041
or anything like that.

98
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:29,500
But, um, they're happy.

99
00:04:29,542 --> 00:04:30,750
And I think,

100
00:04:30,792 --> 00:04:33,291
how do they do it,
you know?

101
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,208
What's the secret?

102
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,667
Well, there's no secret,
Nick.

103
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,291
And some people are
more naturally disposed to have

104
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,208
a positive outlook.

105
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,333
But happiness can
also be derived

106
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:43,959
from intentional activities,
you know,

107
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,250
volunteering and maintaining
close relationships.

108
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:50,542
Well, that's easier said
than done.

109
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:56,041
Okay, that seems like a good
place to start our next session.

110
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,291
Oh, sorry.

111
00:04:57,333 --> 00:05:00,458
I'm, uh, I'm not gonna
be here next week.

112
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,583
Okay. No problem.
We can reschedule.

113
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:04,041
Actually, we can't.

114
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:06,000
I came to say good-bye.

115
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,959
I'm gonna kill myself.

116
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,417
You know what might
make people feel better?

117
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:27,000
Is if they knew there was
a trio of cooplets on the way.

118
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,834
If you wanna keep those hands,
get 'em off my uterus.

119
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,917
Hmm.

120
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:38,750
It's good to see
you've got an appetite.

121
00:05:38,792 --> 00:05:41,291
What I've got is a tapeworm.

122
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,500
Three of 'em, actually.

123
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:43,709
Come on, Charlotte.

124
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,959
Isn't it at least
a little bit fun

125
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,500
to be able to eat
whatever you want?

126
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:49,583
No. It's not fun.

127
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,834
It's disgusting.

128
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,208
I'm having a litter

129
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,959
like some kind of animal.

130
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,041
Oh.

131
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,417
These bloodsucking ticks

132
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,333
growing inside of me
have taken over my body,

133
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:00,542
so I'm just a host now.

134
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:01,875
This is only the beginning.

135
00:06:01,917 --> 00:06:04,333
These are the salad days before
I start waddling around

136
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:07,959
with a veritable
"wide load" sign across my gut.

137
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,125
Which, by the way,

138
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:10,667
is gonna be crisscrossed
with so many stretch marks

139
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:13,250
it'll look like a topo map
of yellowstone.

140
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:16,458
I mean,
a miracle pregnancy, my ass.

141
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,792
My big, fat,
ever-expanding ass.

142
00:06:19,834 --> 00:06:23,208
The car kept stalling out.

143
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,041
Janie and I, we were saving
every cent we had for the baby,

144
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,041
so I put off
getting a tune-up.

145
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,041
By the time
we got to the hospital,

146
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:31,709
the baby was already
coming out.

147
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,625
I was so rattled, I crashed into
the ambulance bay.

148
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,291
Yeah, but Dr. Wilder--

149
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,291
he acted like he saw
that kind of thing every day.

150
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,166
He smiled at Janie,

151
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:45,041
told her she'd have
a great story to tell our kid,

152
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:47,041
and delivered our little Maya
right there.

153
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,583
Your husband...

154
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:54,041
He made a big difference
in my family's life.

155
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,458
He was there for us
when we needed him.

156
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,667
And not just...

157
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:02,041
I'm so sorry for your loss.

158
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:07,041
I called him, you know,
the night before he died.

159
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,834
He sounded relaxed.

160
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,500
I would've been...

161
00:07:11,542 --> 00:07:13,750
Scared as hell of that trial,
but...

162
00:07:13,792 --> 00:07:15,083
Mm.

163
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:18,458
Pete kept on cracking jokes.

164
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,709
If I had known it was gonna be
the last conversation

165
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,959
I ever was gonna have
with him...

166
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,208
I don't know.
I would've said something else.

167
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,000
He knew he had your support.
I'm sure that meant a lot.

168
00:07:30,542 --> 00:07:34,041
He deserved better
than dying in a ditch.

169
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:37,041
I know you know this, but...

170
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,583
You know, anything you need,
anything.

171
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,041
I mean, you need me to stay
at the house,

172
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,542
you need us to take Lucas,
we can do it.

173
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:45,166
I-I never knew that... Pete
wanted this kind of celebration

174
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,375
until I read his will.

175
00:07:46,417 --> 00:07:49,542
I mean,
besides one conversation

176
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,041
where he said he wanted
to be cremated,

177
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,542
we never talked about death,

178
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,291
and we should've
talked about it.

179
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,291
It's a conversation
most people put off.

180
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,792
Maybe.

181
00:07:56,834 --> 00:08:00,709
But I'm a single parent now,
so I have to be prepared.

182
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,041
It would be great
if you could take Lucas.

183
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,709
Sure. No problem.
We can take him tonight.

184
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,625
No, I mean, if anything
happens to me,

185
00:08:08,667 --> 00:08:10,083
I want you to be
his guardian.

186
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:12,375
Oh.

187
00:08:12,417 --> 00:08:15,125
Wow.

188
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,208
Wow. You--
I know--

189
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,709
I know it's a lot
to ask for, but--but--

190
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,083
but they--they--
they get along great.

191
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,792
And--and don't you think
Mason would be happy

192
00:08:23,834 --> 00:08:25,917
to have a little brother?
I certainly hope so.

193
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,083
They could share a room

194
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:29,041
or you could live at my house,
wherever that would be.

195
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,500
Oh. Violet, you know what?

196
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:33,500
I don't wanna think about
you being dead. Not today.

197
00:08:33,542 --> 00:08:35,709
But you have to think about it.
I need you to think about it.

198
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,917
Okay?

199
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:38,709
And talk to Charlotte.

200
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,375
Okay?

201
00:08:40,417 --> 00:08:41,625
Okay.

202
00:08:44,834 --> 00:08:47,750
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Sheldon.
Wait, you're not coming?

203
00:08:47,792 --> 00:08:48,959
No, I am coming.

204
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,792
I-I just can't leave yet.

205
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:52,333
Sheldon,
we need a shrink here.

206
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,750
I mean,
Violet's keeping it together,

207
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:55,458
but who knows how long
that will last?

208
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,041
Yeah, well, I'll get there
as soon as I can.

209
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,000
Okay.

210
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,959
How long have you been
considering killing yourself?

211
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,208
Feels like forever.

212
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,208
I'm sorry I didn't
bring it up before.

213
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,250
I didn't think
you'd understand, but...

214
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,375
It really is for the best,
Dr. Wallace.

215
00:09:16,417 --> 00:09:18,041
What's your plan?

216
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,917
Pills seem easiest.

217
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,208
That way, I'll go to sleep
and...

218
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,041
It'll be over.

219
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:30,083
I've got two kinds
of sedatives.

220
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,041
Okay, Nick.

221
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,583
I think we should go
to the hospital.
No.

222
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:35,875
I cannot let you go home.

223
00:09:35,917 --> 00:09:37,375
I'm not going
to the hospital.

224
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:41,041
Ah, god, I'm sorry.

225
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,542
I didn't mean to yell. I...

226
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,041
What made you decide
that tonight's the night?

227
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:50,208
I mean...

228
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,250
Did something happen?

229
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,834
I think you want my help,
Nick.

230
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,917
I think that's why
you told me your plan.

231
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:59,000
But I can't give it unless
you're gonna be honest with me.

232
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,542
Triple grande latte
with one sugar.

233
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:11,709
That's Gail's order.

234
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,041
I see her getting coffee
most mornings.

235
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,709
Um...

236
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:19,250
Last week, she forgot
her wallet, so I paid,

237
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,083
and we got to talking.

238
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,875
She was...

239
00:10:22,917 --> 00:10:26,000
She was nice,
so I asked her out.

240
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,250
W-What did she say?

241
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,375
Yes.

242
00:10:32,417 --> 00:10:34,542
Can you believe that?

243
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,667
Um, well, we went out
to dinner

244
00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:41,125
and then back to her place,

245
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:44,583
and, um, next thing I knew,

246
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,625
our clothes were off.

247
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:53,041
And...

248
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:56,041
I've been so lonely.

249
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:59,291
But looking at Gail,

250
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,583
I felt nothing.

251
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:07,583
So...

252
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,625
I started thinking
about Stella,

253
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:12,917
her creamy shoulders

254
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,041
peeking out
from a tank top,

255
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:19,250
her smooth little Colt legs.

256
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,166
And then it was okay.

257
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:24,375
It's not unusual

258
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,625
for men to think about
other women during sex.

259
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:28,250
Stella's not a woman.

260
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,375
No. She...

261
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,583
She's my goddaughter.

262
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:39,000
She's 8.

263
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,250
Do you know how many times
I've peed since we've been here?

264
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,375
Five.

265
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:52,250
Five times.

266
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,667
God, I'd sell my soul for
a good old fashioned u.T.I.

267
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:58,166
I can bitch slap into submission
with some simple antibiotics.

268
00:11:59,917 --> 00:12:02,917
So, uh, Violet asked me
this thing.

269
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,041
This, um, funny thing.

270
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,667
Crazy, clearly,

271
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:09,417
given what we're, uh...

272
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:11,834
You know, she's grieving,

273
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,041
so you wanna give her
what she wants.

274
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,041
What'd she ask?

275
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:17,875
Um... if anything happens
to her,

276
00:12:17,917 --> 00:12:20,000
she asked if we would
take Lucas.

277
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,417
We have Mason...

278
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,041
Who is amazing.

279
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,041
About we're about to have
three more.

280
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,208
Yay, us!

281
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,250
And you wanna add
a fifth child

282
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,041
so what, we can field
our own volleyball team?

283
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,250
Okay, aren't you
a teensy bit flattered

284
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:38,458
that she recognizes what
an incredible mother you are?

285
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,917
Well, then let's not
stop there.

286
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,875
Hell, why not throw Henry
into the mix, too?

287
00:12:42,917 --> 00:12:44,667
Make it an even half-dozen,

288
00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:46,709
'cause when I said
I never wanted children,

289
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,834
what I really meant was,

290
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:52,041
"I want all the children."

291
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:58,041
I never talked about this
before... with anyone.

292
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:01,625
Nick, have you ever had
any sexual contact with Stella?
Never.

293
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:04,041
Any physical contact that could
be perceived as sexual

294
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,417
with any child?

295
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,291
No.

296
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:10,041
So you've never acted on
your desire for young girls?

297
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,542
No.

298
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,750
But I think about it.

299
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:16,583
A lot.

300
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:19,583
I have to drive past
this elementary school

301
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,041
on the way to work,

302
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,250
and I try to get down the street
as quickly as possible,

303
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:27,083
but... sometimes
the crossing guard stops me.

304
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:31,917
So... I sit there,

305
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:35,333
and I watch the kids walk past.

306
00:13:39,709 --> 00:13:44,917
Have you ever really looked
at an 8-year-old girl?

307
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,375
I mean...

308
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:53,041
My god.

309
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,000
They're so beautiful.

310
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,834
So innocent.

311
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:02,542
And their bodies are like
absolute perfection.

312
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,542
You think I'm disgusting,
don't you?

313
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:10,709
No. I'm not here
to judge you, Nick.

314
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,417
I'm just trying
to understand.

315
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:15,041
It's simple.
I'm a monster.

316
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:18,208
And no matter how hard I try,
I can't change the way I feel.

317
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,542
How--how do you control
these urges?

318
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:24,041
I go home and...

319
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,583
I, uh...

320
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,041
I release the tension.

321
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,417
You masturbate?

322
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:30,625
Yes.

323
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:32,834
That way,
no one gets hurt.

324
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:36,333
That's a good solution,
right?

325
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,792
My concern is that

326
00:14:37,834 --> 00:14:40,041
continual fantasizing about
sexual acts with young girls

327
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,417
can make that seem normal.

328
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:46,041
And once that taboo
is removed,

329
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:49,041
self-restraint can become
very difficult.

330
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,083
I know,

331
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:54,083
which is why the only solution
is for me to die.

332
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,041
I should be dead.

333
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:58,208
I was dead.

334
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,542
I was standing in my kitchen,
chopping garlic,

335
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:04,041
talking to my husband,
and then I started convulsing.

336
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,709
He calls 9-1-1,

337
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,500
and by the time
the paramedics got there,

338
00:15:07,542 --> 00:15:09,041
my heart had stopped.

339
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:13,625
They shocked me three times
and took me to the E.R., and...

340
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:16,166
Dr. Wilder.
He brought me back.

341
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:18,417
He did 20 minutes
of c.P.R.,

342
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,625
shocked me
three more times.

343
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:23,959
He didn't give up on me.
He just...

344
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,041
Wouldn't.

345
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,458
Your husband never gave up.

346
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,542
Excuse me, ladies,
but I need to steal Violet.

347
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,458
Her son's looking for her.
Oh. Sure.

348
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,875
Where's Lucas?

349
00:15:32,917 --> 00:15:35,041
I don't know, but I thought
you needed a break.

350
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,208
Hey.

351
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:43,667
Jake said I should give this
thing a test drive, so...

352
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:47,542
Sam...

353
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:50,417
I was planning on telling you
that Jake moved in.

354
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:51,625
Oh, that's fine.
That's fine.

355
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:53,291
This is actually
really good Espresso.

356
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:54,917
I-I didn't mean
to blindside you or--

357
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,041
it's okay. It's okay.

358
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:58,917
Did Jake tell you where
he got these beans?

359
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,417
No.
No?

360
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,625
Oh.

361
00:16:04,417 --> 00:16:05,583
Look, um...

362
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:10,792
There are no books on this.
I looked.

363
00:16:10,834 --> 00:16:12,166
What?

364
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,291
On how to stay friends
with your ex-wife's best friend

365
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:17,166
who rejected
your marriage proposal

366
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:18,792
after adopting a child...

367
00:16:18,834 --> 00:16:22,750
And then moving in
with your coworker.

368
00:16:22,792 --> 00:16:25,333
There are no books on it,
so...

369
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:30,041
I figured we could just stick to
small talk about the Espresso.

370
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:32,000
Oh.

371
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,625
Are we?

372
00:16:34,667 --> 00:16:35,834
Hmm?

373
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,000
Ever gonna be friends again?

374
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,041
The key to a good Espresso
is the quality of the grinder.

375
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,792
Oh.

376
00:16:45,834 --> 00:16:49,041
That is an interesting fact.

377
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,583
Grinder.

378
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,625
Our father died
two years ago.

379
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:54,917
It pretty much took the starch
out of mother,

380
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,000
so we figured she was
just grieving.

381
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,083
Um, she didn't tell us
about the pain.

382
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:02,083
By the time we noticed it,
well...

383
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:05,041
With pancreatic cancer,
there's not much you can do.

384
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,333
And she wanted to
die at home,

385
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:08,750
and she made us promise.

386
00:17:08,792 --> 00:17:11,041
But that last day,

387
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:15,792
her breathing got so labored,
and she looked so scared,

388
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,583
that I wanted to take her
to the hospital.

389
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:18,834
Yeah, we both did.

390
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,041
But Dr. Wilder,

391
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,458
he said we should honor
her wishes.

392
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,875
And when he came into the room,

393
00:17:24,917 --> 00:17:27,333
he had such a calming effect
on her.

394
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:30,041
So she got to die
in her own bed,

395
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,542
looking out at her garden,
surrounded by her children...

396
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,875
And dogs.

397
00:17:34,917 --> 00:17:36,500
And it was so peaceful.

398
00:17:36,542 --> 00:17:39,166
I will be grateful
for the rest of my life

399
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,792
that she didn't die alone.

400
00:17:57,709 --> 00:18:00,291
Are you gonna hurl?

401
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,583
What are you doing
out here?

402
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,625
Lucas wanted to watch
"the muppets" movie,

403
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:05,125
for, like, the billionth time.

404
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:09,041
What about you?

405
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,458
I...

406
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,333
Um...

407
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,083
It's getting hot in there.

408
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:22,625
Pete was nice.
It really sucks that he died.

409
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:24,625
Yeah.

410
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:26,959
It does.

411
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,250
He'll be okay, though.

412
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,458
My mom says when you die,

413
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,041
it's like going to
a big reunion.

414
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:40,750
You get to hang out
with everyone you really love.

415
00:18:40,792 --> 00:18:43,083
Oh, I bet my mom will introduce
Pete to my grandma.

416
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,583
Gram's really cool.

417
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:53,709
It's--it's lonely, though,
being left behind.

418
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:57,709
I-I felt lonely
when my mom died.

419
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,667
Are you lonely?

420
00:19:00,709 --> 00:19:03,917
Yeah.

421
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:06,583
You want some?

422
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,375
I was raised catholic.

423
00:19:20,417 --> 00:19:21,583
Did I tell you that?

424
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,000
Yeah.

425
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:26,959
Yeah, I was taught that
god never makes mistakes.

426
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,750
Well...

427
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,542
It's pretty clear
that's not true, huh?

428
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,375
He obviously had an off day
with me.

429
00:19:35,417 --> 00:19:38,041
Why couldn't I have been
a drug addict

430
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,166
or an alcoholic?

431
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,000
I mean, god.

432
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:43,375
My life would've been
so much different

433
00:19:43,417 --> 00:19:45,792
if the thing I couldn't
get enough of was booze.

434
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:48,208
I mean, I-I could join
a 12-step program.

435
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,458
People would actually
wanna hear my story.

436
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:56,250
They'd try to help me and say
how brave I was to come clean.

437
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,041
But they don't have
support groups

438
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,500
for people like me.

439
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,834
I can't tell anyone what I am.

440
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:06,041
But you told me,

441
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,375
and that's a good
first step.

442
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:10,959
And the fact that you haven't
acted on your impulses,

443
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,125
we can build on that.

444
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:15,375
Don't play me, Dr. Wallace.

445
00:20:15,417 --> 00:20:16,792
I'm not stupid.

446
00:20:16,834 --> 00:20:18,333
As a teenager,

447
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:21,959
I used to just hope
that I would outgrow this.

448
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,375
But...

449
00:20:23,417 --> 00:20:24,583
No.

450
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,041
That's never gonna happen.

451
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:30,041
Right? 'Cause there's
no magic pills that I can take

452
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,041
that make me stop fantasizing
about little girls.

453
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,417
There's no surgery

454
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:37,834
to remove this deviant part
of my brain, right?

455
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:42,166
Right?

456
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,000
No, there isn't.

457
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:47,375
Then what do we have
to talk about?

458
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:53,834
Did Pete even like karaoke?

459
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,500
I don't know. I never...

460
00:20:56,542 --> 00:20:59,208
Heard the man
so much as whistle.

461
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,208
You did not miss much.

462
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,458
I loved Pete.

463
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,250
We weren't in love,
we weren't soul mates,

464
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:09,041
but, you know, we fit together
for a while.

465
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:12,041
You know, that time that we had
where we...

466
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,959
Took care of Lucas.

467
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,041
Even for that short time
before Violet came back,

468
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:17,917
that's...
That's when I knew

469
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:19,667
that I could raise a child
on my own.

470
00:21:19,709 --> 00:21:21,917
Pete did that for me.

471
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:23,041
Mm.

472
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,041
I wish I could've
told him that.

473
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:28,333
You know, Violet asked me to be
Lucas' guardian

474
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,500
in case anything happens
to...

475
00:21:30,542 --> 00:21:32,375
Did you tell her about
the triplets?

476
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:33,583
In case you hadn't noticed,

477
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,041
Charlotte's a little scary
right now.

478
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,333
Yeah, I got that.

479
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:39,750
I mean, I'd love to say yes
for Violet,

480
00:21:39,792 --> 00:21:42,250
and for Pete.

481
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:44,583
I don't know
how to convince Charlotte.

482
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:48,792
Honestly, I don't know if
I should convince Charlotte.

483
00:21:48,834 --> 00:21:52,166
I mean,
with these babies coming,

484
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,333
my family has to be
my priority, right?

485
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,917
Yes.

486
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:00,834
Any advice on that?

487
00:22:02,792 --> 00:22:04,000
Have another drink.

488
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:10,041
I was in the kitchen last week.
Pete was reading the paper.

489
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:12,083
Travel section,
about Hawaii.

490
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:15,542
Said he was thinking about
taking Violet and Lucas there

491
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:16,792
once the trial was over,

492
00:22:16,834 --> 00:22:19,583
like he was certain
it was gonna go his way.

493
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:20,792
Hmm.

494
00:22:20,834 --> 00:22:23,291
Said he always wanted
to learn how to surf.

495
00:22:24,542 --> 00:22:25,709
Mm.

496
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,000
I told him, "hey, I, uh,
I have an extra board.

497
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:30,083
I can--i can teach you."

498
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,792
That's the last time
we spoke.

499
00:22:33,834 --> 00:22:38,583
Yeah, he was one of
the good ones.

500
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:42,375
After all the time he spent
making death easier for people,

501
00:22:42,417 --> 00:22:45,041
I wish somebody
could've done it for him.

502
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:48,000
Yeah. You know, I couldn't do
what he did.

503
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:50,166
I need to be around people
creating life,

504
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:52,375
helping them start a family.

505
00:22:52,417 --> 00:22:56,041
You know, no matter how hard
the journey is,

506
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,000
I've never once had a mother
tell me that it wasn't worth it

507
00:22:58,041 --> 00:22:59,625
once she held her child.

508
00:22:59,667 --> 00:23:02,458
Has Addison been talking
to you?

509
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,291
About what?

510
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:11,709
Do me a favor.

511
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,083
Don't tell me
any stories about Pete

512
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,625
or try to make me
feel better.

513
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:17,709
Hey. I just wanted a cookie.

514
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:25,041
That jacket looks good
on you.

515
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:26,583
Yeah.

516
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:28,041
I figured I'd get the motorcycle
to go with it next.

517
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,291
Ohh.

518
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:36,500
Uh, or perhaps a lighter.

519
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:38,834
Holy crap. I didn't know
that was in there.

520
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,375
Violet?

521
00:23:40,417 --> 00:23:44,083
I'm Aaron Colvin. I worked
with Pete in El Salvador.

522
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:45,500
Oh. Thank you for coming.

523
00:23:45,542 --> 00:23:46,709
I'm sure that would've
meant a lot to Pete.

524
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,041
I'm not so sure about that.

525
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:52,041
Pete and I,
we had a falling out

526
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:53,500
15 years ago.

527
00:23:53,542 --> 00:23:55,417
It ended in a fistfight.

528
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:59,959
For the life of me, I-I can't
remember what it was about.

529
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,083
I always figured our paths
would cross again

530
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:04,458
and we'd sit down
and have a beer

531
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,542
and laugh about it.

532
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:11,834
But now it's too late.

533
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:13,959
And I can't believe
I wasted all this time,

534
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,750
nursing some ridiculous,
ancient grudge that--

535
00:24:17,792 --> 00:24:19,000
could you please excuse me?

536
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:28,083
There's a lot that we don't know
about pedophilia,

537
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:30,333
about human sexuality
in general.

538
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:34,083
But what I can tell is that by
the time we're 8 or 9 years old,

539
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:35,291
we've been dealt a card,

540
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:37,041
and that determines
what turns us on.

541
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:39,375
And in the perfect world,

542
00:24:39,417 --> 00:24:43,041
satisfying those urges,
it doesn't hurt anybody.

543
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:45,500
I obviously don't live
in that world.

544
00:24:45,542 --> 00:24:48,750
I'm a freak.
You can't fix me.

545
00:24:48,792 --> 00:24:51,000
I can't cure your
sexual attraction to children.

546
00:24:51,041 --> 00:24:53,000
That's true.

547
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:54,792
But a lot of people have
inappropriate fantasies,

548
00:24:54,834 --> 00:24:58,625
and the problem only arises
when they try to act on them.

549
00:24:58,667 --> 00:25:00,875
We can work
on your impulse control.

550
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:03,041
It's not easy.
It's a lifelong struggle.

551
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:05,041
But we can protect
the people around you.

552
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:07,375
Wait.

553
00:25:07,417 --> 00:25:08,792
You're saying I can change?

554
00:25:08,834 --> 00:25:12,583
What I'm saying is,
there are things we can try.

555
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:14,375
Avoiding mood swings is key.

556
00:25:14,417 --> 00:25:17,041
And you're going to have to be
diligent about keeping busy,

557
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:21,041
about maintaining structure
in your life.

558
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:22,750
I can't believe it.

559
00:25:22,792 --> 00:25:25,041
You actually wanna help me?

560
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:27,208
I'm your doctor.
Nick? Nick?

561
00:25:28,458 --> 00:25:29,583
Nick, are you okay?

562
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,583
Nick, what did you do?
What did you take?

563
00:25:34,625 --> 00:25:36,041
Nick?

564
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:38,166
This is Dr. Sheldon Wallace.

565
00:25:38,208 --> 00:25:40,959
I need an ambulance
at 4000 ocean park.

566
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,625
It's a possible overdose.

567
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:45,583
I'm sorry.
I didn't wanna die alone.

568
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:51,583
Violet?

569
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:55,041
Are you all right?

570
00:25:55,083 --> 00:25:56,375
Violet, you've been up here
a while.

571
00:25:56,417 --> 00:25:58,917
I'm starting to get worried.

572
00:26:02,625 --> 00:26:04,834
Okay, I'm coming in.

573
00:26:06,458 --> 00:26:07,667
Hey.

574
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:10,667
Are you...

575
00:26:14,417 --> 00:26:16,041
Are you... getting high?

576
00:26:26,417 --> 00:26:28,917
Oh, my god.
You've got to be kidding me!

577
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:30,375
This is a really big tub.

578
00:26:30,417 --> 00:26:32,750
You guys cannot do this. I have
a--i have a kid downstairs.

579
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:34,625
Oh, come on. We all have kids,
and they're all next door.

580
00:26:34,667 --> 00:26:37,041
Get in the tub, Coop.
Come on!

581
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:39,542
You know you wanna do it.
Come on! Get in the tub.

582
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:41,041
You don't have to. I didn't.

583
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:42,709
You just give her a minute,
she'll forget she asked.

584
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,500
What, you're not high?
What are you doing up here?

585
00:26:44,542 --> 00:26:46,542
I didn't think
that she should be alone.

586
00:26:46,583 --> 00:26:47,875
My husband is dead.

587
00:26:47,917 --> 00:26:50,041
Yesterday, I pushed a button
and watched him burn,

588
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:51,458
so I get whatever I want
today.

589
00:26:54,291 --> 00:26:56,041
Come on, Cooper.

590
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:58,500
I really need someone
in the tub with me.

591
00:27:01,834 --> 00:27:03,500
No.

592
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:07,000
Would you like to go lay down
for a little while?

593
00:27:07,041 --> 00:27:09,709
Let's live here, in the tub.

594
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:15,333
Drugs are bad.

595
00:27:15,375 --> 00:27:16,875
Mm.

596
00:27:16,917 --> 00:27:18,041
Drugs are bad.

597
00:27:18,083 --> 00:27:19,667
They make my tongue feel
like cheese.

598
00:27:19,709 --> 00:27:22,375
Cheese? I wish we had
some cheese here.

599
00:27:22,417 --> 00:27:24,041
Addison?

600
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:25,250
Yes?
Addison?

601
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:26,458
What?
Addison?

602
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,792
Still here.
Cheese?

603
00:27:27,834 --> 00:27:29,041
Where does cheese come?
How do we get cheese?

604
00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:30,917
Is there a cheese man?

605
00:27:30,959 --> 00:27:33,667
Ohh!

606
00:27:33,709 --> 00:27:35,041
I think we need a cow.

607
00:27:35,083 --> 00:27:37,250
Oh, let's buy a cow.
Buy a cow!
I could totally buy a cow!

608
00:27:39,542 --> 00:27:41,792
Or... I could order
a pizza.

609
00:27:41,834 --> 00:27:44,625
I have a phone. We can.

610
00:27:50,458 --> 00:27:52,375
Charlotte's not gonna
let you get away with this

611
00:27:52,417 --> 00:27:53,583
much longer, Cooper.

612
00:27:53,625 --> 00:27:54,792
Charlotte's not
the boss of me, man.

613
00:27:54,834 --> 00:27:55,834
No.

614
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:57,041
Charlotte is the mother
of my triplets,

615
00:27:57,083 --> 00:27:58,792
but not the boss of me.
Triplets? What triplets?

616
00:28:00,542 --> 00:28:02,000
Hmm?

617
00:28:02,041 --> 00:28:03,041
Oh! Ohh!

618
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:05,000
Whoo!

619
00:28:05,041 --> 00:28:06,041
Okay.

620
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:07,792
Oh, my god. Okay.

621
00:28:07,834 --> 00:28:09,333
Okay.

622
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:11,041
Please don't be mad.
I'm sorry.

623
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:13,166
I know that is
the kind of thing

624
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:14,625
you're supposed to tell
your best friend,

625
00:28:14,667 --> 00:28:16,375
but Charlotte would not
let me tell you.

626
00:28:16,417 --> 00:28:19,000
I so wanted to tell you!
Triplets!

627
00:28:19,041 --> 00:28:22,125
And Addison only knows
because she is her doctor.

628
00:28:22,166 --> 00:28:24,166
Yeah.
And it felt really weird
to talk about babies

629
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:25,166
once I found out
Pete was dead.

630
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:26,375
Oh, yeah.

631
00:28:26,417 --> 00:28:29,041
And also,
I'm like...

632
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:31,041
I'm so happy.

633
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:34,208
And Charlotte is...
So not happy.

634
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:50,208
Oh. Hey, I-I think you have
the wrong house.

635
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,417
Hi. Oh, no, no, no, no.
No, he doesn't.

636
00:28:52,458 --> 00:28:53,834
Here you go.
Keep the change.

637
00:28:53,875 --> 00:28:55,041
Thank you.

638
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:56,375
Whoa, Addison,

639
00:28:56,417 --> 00:28:57,875
you've already got more than
enough food for everybody.

640
00:28:57,917 --> 00:29:00,542
Uh, no, this isn't for
the people downstairs.

641
00:29:00,583 --> 00:29:02,041
Who's it for?

642
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:04,083
Oh. Are you serious?

643
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:06,625
Cheese men. Cheese men.
Hey!

644
00:29:06,667 --> 00:29:08,208
Hee hee hee hee!

645
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:10,041
Okay, we are going
to need more pizzas.

646
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,625
People are downstairs,
trying to pay tribute to Pete,

647
00:29:13,667 --> 00:29:15,166
and you guys are up here
getting high?

648
00:29:15,208 --> 00:29:17,041
Lighten up, man.
Light up, Sam.

649
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:20,041
Oh, no, he's not gonna
do it. He's never done that.

650
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:21,500
- Is that true?
- Really?

651
00:29:21,542 --> 00:29:23,041
Like,
from a chicken thing?

652
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:24,041
No, I'm not chicken.

653
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:26,041
Mnh.
Bok bok bok.

654
00:29:26,083 --> 00:29:27,500
Did you just cluck at me?

655
00:29:27,542 --> 00:29:30,458
Bok bok bok.
See--see, that's why
don't do it.

656
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,834
It's got you guys acting
like idiots,

657
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:35,834
grown adults making
animal sounds.
Bok!

658
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:38,333
Not to mention it's illegal.
Not when medically prescribed
in the state of California.

659
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:40,041
I'm a doctor.

660
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:41,750
Violet, I prescribe you
marijuana.

661
00:29:41,792 --> 00:29:43,125
Cooper, I prescribe you
marijuana.

662
00:29:43,166 --> 00:29:45,542
Jake, shall I
prescribe you marijuana?

663
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:47,083
- I'm good, thanks.
- Besides,

664
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:49,041
nobody's gonna tell me what
I can do in my own damn house.

665
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:50,959
In my own damn house.

666
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,667
Oh. There either.
Doctor's order, Sam.

667
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:56,041
I'm sorry. I just care about
what I put into my body.

668
00:29:56,083 --> 00:29:58,041
I care about
my short-term memory.

669
00:29:58,083 --> 00:30:01,083
Marijuana abuse has also been
tied to cancer, brain damage,

670
00:30:01,125 --> 00:30:02,792
depression.
It's also been tied

671
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:04,709
to relieving symptoms
of all those things, Sam.

672
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,041
You're defending them
right now?

673
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:07,500
If you're such a fan,
how come you're not smoking?

674
00:30:07,542 --> 00:30:09,583
Because the one time
I smoked pot,

675
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:11,542
I felt like my lungs
were melting.

676
00:30:11,583 --> 00:30:13,333
And I got so paranoid

677
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:14,750
I hid in the closet
for three hours

678
00:30:14,792 --> 00:30:16,125
and I might've peed my pants.

679
00:30:17,792 --> 00:30:19,750
Jake?

680
00:30:19,792 --> 00:30:20,834
Not for me.

681
00:30:23,542 --> 00:30:25,291
You know,
it's Pete's ganja, Sam.

682
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:27,375
It's like a sign.

683
00:30:27,417 --> 00:30:29,375
I mean, Pete is the reason
we're all here.

684
00:30:29,417 --> 00:30:33,834
And we're all here,
and Pete is gone?

685
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:37,000
That's wrong. It--it's just
all kinds of wrong.

686
00:30:37,041 --> 00:30:40,041
I don't know.
It doesn't make any sense.

687
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:42,709
And it just feels bad.
And who wants to feel bad?

688
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,834
Who wants to feel
when feeling feels this bad?

689
00:30:46,875 --> 00:30:48,417
What he said.

690
00:30:48,458 --> 00:30:50,041
Violet?

691
00:30:52,041 --> 00:30:53,125
Do you want me to go downstairs

692
00:30:53,166 --> 00:30:56,041
and tell those people
to go home?

693
00:30:56,083 --> 00:30:57,375
I can do that.

694
00:30:57,417 --> 00:31:01,041
Can we just stay here
a little bit longer?

695
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:02,125
A little bit, all of us?

696
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:04,375
Then I'll go back to being
a widow.

697
00:31:04,417 --> 00:31:06,625
Whatever you want.

698
00:31:12,667 --> 00:31:16,417
He never ate the crust
off his pizza.

699
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:20,125
But he loved
chocolate chip mint ice cream.

700
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:23,583
And he couldn't parallel park
to save his life.

701
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:29,041
He had really awesome hair.

702
00:31:29,083 --> 00:31:31,166
Mm.

703
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,291
I'm alive.

704
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:53,500
Barely.

705
00:31:53,542 --> 00:31:55,166
The E.R. doc said
the acetaminophen level

706
00:31:55,208 --> 00:31:58,166
in your blood put you at risk
for liver failure.

707
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:02,041
Another few hours, your liver
might've completely shut down.

708
00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:05,250
I swallowed the whole bottle
before I came to see you.

709
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:10,000
Are you gonna
do that again, Nick?

710
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:14,625
I don't know.

711
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:18,041
I studied buddhism
for a while.

712
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:19,041
Not to convert.

713
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:20,208
I just wanted to understand

714
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:22,333
a religion whose goal
was to end suffering.

715
00:32:22,375 --> 00:32:25,083
You know
the interesting thing?

716
00:32:25,125 --> 00:32:27,458
Suffering is a great teacher,

717
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,458
because you never know
what you might become

718
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,208
after you work through it,

719
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:35,709
which is why every life
is worth saving.

720
00:32:37,542 --> 00:32:39,041
Even mine?

721
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:40,542
Yes.

722
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:44,542
Do you really think
you can help me?

723
00:32:44,583 --> 00:32:47,458
That's up to you.

724
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:52,041
But if we do work together, you
cannot keep any secrets from me.

725
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:54,959
I don't have
any more to keep.

726
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,333
Well, then I'll be back
in the morning.

727
00:33:12,125 --> 00:33:13,500
Hey.

728
00:33:13,542 --> 00:33:15,792
I have something
to say.

729
00:33:15,834 --> 00:33:19,917
Okay, I'm gonna say it,
and you're gonna listen.

730
00:33:19,959 --> 00:33:22,333
How can you do this
to Violet?

731
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,583
I mean, what kind of person

732
00:33:24,625 --> 00:33:27,208
would leave a little boy
parentless,

733
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:28,834
out in the street?

734
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:30,750
For crying out loud, Cooper.

735
00:33:30,792 --> 00:33:35,000
Of course we'll take Lucas
if something happens to Violet.

736
00:33:36,166 --> 00:33:37,750
We will?

737
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:40,041
My life as I know it
is over.

738
00:33:40,083 --> 00:33:43,709
We've already got four kids.
What's one more?

739
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,959
I'm gonna need some help
parenting that brood.

740
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,250
I'd prefer it
if you weren't stoned.

741
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,792
Oh, cake.

742
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:04,625
And Dr. Wilder was there for me
all through my cancer.

743
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:07,166
Nothing worked on the nausea
I had from the chemo

744
00:34:07,208 --> 00:34:09,333
until he tried acupuncture.

745
00:34:09,375 --> 00:34:10,959
Excuse me.

746
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,333
It's Derek.

747
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:15,417
He gave me my life back.

748
00:34:15,458 --> 00:34:17,041
I'm so grateful.

749
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:20,000
Stop crying.
My husband wanted a celebration.

750
00:34:20,041 --> 00:34:22,250
I'm sorry. I just...

751
00:34:25,417 --> 00:34:27,041
They, uh...

752
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:30,375
They took Mark Sloan
off life support.

753
00:34:31,625 --> 00:34:33,208
He's dead.

754
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:35,792
No, no, no. No. No.
No, we don't cry today.

755
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:39,041
We don't cry today.
This is not what Pete wanted.

756
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:40,792
Was I not clear?

757
00:34:40,834 --> 00:34:44,083
He wanted a party.
He wanted--he wanted singing.

This is what he wanted.
All right?

769
00:35:28,542 --> 00:35:31,166
This is all he wanted
those last months,

770
00:35:31,208 --> 00:35:34,041
just to have a good time.

771
00:35:34,083 --> 00:35:35,500
Why talk about your problems

772
00:35:35,542 --> 00:35:37,333
when you can pretend
they don't exist?

773
00:35:37,375 --> 00:35:39,583
Just enjoy yourself! Be happy!

774
00:35:39,625 --> 00:35:41,000
Which is ironic

775
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:44,166
because he was the angriest guy
I have ever known.

776
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:47,500
This--this man that you keep
talking about,

777
00:35:47,542 --> 00:35:49,750
"Mr. There when you need him,"
"Mr. Never give up,"

778
00:35:49,792 --> 00:35:50,875
that was not Pete.

779
00:35:50,917 --> 00:35:52,250
He did give up.

780
00:35:52,291 --> 00:35:56,291
He died before he could tell me
what went wrong in our marriage.

781
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:59,792
How dare he leave me
to raise Lucas on my own?!

782
00:35:59,834 --> 00:36:02,542
How dare he demand
that I throw him a party

783
00:36:02,583 --> 00:36:07,667
when all people wanna do
is scream and cry?!

784
00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:18,291
That selfish son of a bitch.

785
00:36:19,417 --> 00:36:20,709
What the hell happened
here tonight?

786
00:36:32,083 --> 00:36:35,041
Where were you?

787
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:37,625
I had a patient emergency.

788
00:36:37,667 --> 00:36:39,834
I'm sorry.

789
00:36:39,875 --> 00:36:41,375
What can I do for you?

790
00:36:41,417 --> 00:36:43,041
Bring my husband back.

791
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:47,458
If it were in my power,
you know I would.

792
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,000
Tell me everything's gonna
be all right.

793
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,125
Violet.

794
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:53,208
Just...

795
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:55,125
Just tell me.

796
00:36:55,166 --> 00:36:56,625
Please?

797
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:01,458
Everything's gonna
be all right.

798
00:37:04,083 --> 00:37:05,667
And even though

799
00:37:05,709 --> 00:37:07,291
your uncle Pete won't be around
when you grow up,

800
00:37:07,333 --> 00:37:09,917
he'll still
be watching out for you.

801
00:37:09,959 --> 00:37:12,625
Now you have
your very own guardian angel...

802
00:37:12,667 --> 00:37:14,625
Keeping you safe.

803
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:17,083
You do.

804
00:37:19,917 --> 00:37:23,250
I like the thought
of Pete looking out for him.

805
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:28,208
Thank you for, uh,
taking care of him today.

806
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:31,375
Of course.
You had your hands full.

807
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:33,417
Huh?

808
00:37:33,458 --> 00:37:35,583
I lied to you.

809
00:37:35,625 --> 00:37:36,792
About what?

810
00:37:36,834 --> 00:37:39,250
When I turned you down
to be my surrogate,

811
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:42,709
I told you it was because
you were newly sober

812
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:45,041
and you needed to figure out
who you are,

813
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:47,000
and that was part of it,
but...

814
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:51,041
I also didn't think you were
good enough.

815
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:53,041
Well, I can understand that.

816
00:37:53,083 --> 00:37:54,875
I was wrong.

817
00:37:54,917 --> 00:37:57,417
You are...

818
00:37:57,458 --> 00:37:59,333
Such a good thing
in my son's life.

819
00:37:59,375 --> 00:38:01,917
He loves you so much.

820
00:38:01,959 --> 00:38:05,208
And you love him.

821
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,041
