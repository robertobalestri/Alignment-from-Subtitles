00:00:03,291 --> 00:00:05,083
♪ Ohhh ohhh ohhh ♪

2
00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:10,500
Morning.

3
00:00:10,542 --> 00:00:13,500
It's day 182
of project cooplets.

4
00:00:13,542 --> 00:00:17,375
We're at 26 weeks. Multiples are
usually born around 32.

5
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:22,625
So I'm savoring every
last minute of this pregnancy.

6
00:00:22,667 --> 00:00:26,333
I mean, just look
at my gorgeous wife.

7
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:28,041
I know what you're thinking.

8
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:30,375
How did I get so lucky?

9
00:00:30,417 --> 00:00:32,041
I swear, I have no idea.

10
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:36,417
All I know is that this is what
I've wanted my entire life--

11
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:41,250
to take care of my pregnant wife
and a house full of kids.

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,875
Oh.

13
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:48,583
You know,
I'm really not much

14
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:51,041
of a morning person,
but there's so much to do now,

15
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:52,667
it's really all about
multitasking.

16
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:56,083
The babies are the size
of lettuce this week.

17
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:58,041
You know,
there is an app for that.

18
00:00:58,083 --> 00:00:59,667
Brain development has kicked
into high gear,

19
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:02,208
so it's important that Charlotte
get all the right nutrition.

20
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,083
And yeah, sometimes
when I give her her vitamins,

21
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:06,834
she throws them at me,
but I don't take it personally.

22
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:08,417
This is what I can do
to contribute

23
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:11,583
while she is doing all
the heavy lifting, literally.

24
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:16,667
Yes!

25
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:18,583
Breakfast is Charlotte's
least favorite meal,

26
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:21,667
so I like to give her
plenty of options.

27
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:22,500
Thanks for making
me pancakes, dad.

28
00:01:22,542 --> 00:01:26,458
You got it, mase.

29
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,208
Rise and shine, beautiful.

30
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,959
Time to get up.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,667
Enough
with the damn breakfast buffet.

32
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:38,917
It's too early.

33
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:40,083
I let you sleep
as long as I could.

34
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:41,750
No, Coop.

35
00:01:41,792 --> 00:01:44,208
My water just broke.
The babies are coming.

36
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,667
You knocked me up.

37
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:01,041
My guys prevailed.

38
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:05,041
Sweetie, we're having a baby,
you and me?

39
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,709
We're having a baby.

40
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,709
No, Cooper.

41
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,750
We're having three babies.

42
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,667
Three? Three babies.

43
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:17,041
That...

44
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,667
Is amazing. I'm--wow. Okay.

45
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:21,041
I can't react.
She--she doesn't want one.

46
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:22,917
She's definitely
not gonna want three.

47
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,041
But I'm totally excited.
You get that, right?

48
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:28,583
Wow.

49
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:29,959
That's one word for it.

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,041
I can think of a few others,
all four letters.

51
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:35,542
Are you okay?

52
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,500
No. You heard me, right?

53
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:39,041
Three babies.

54
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,709
I know when the night
of conception was.

55
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,750
We were in the shower,
and she did this thing...
No, I'm not all right.

56
00:02:42,792 --> 00:02:44,500
And then I did
this other thing...
This thing's supposed to be
99.9% effective.

57
00:02:44,542 --> 00:02:46,291
And I made sounds
come out of her...
Lucky me. I'm the 1%.

58
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,291
That you do not hear
in nature.
Ugh! You know how big
I'm gonna get...

59
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,709
I was the man.

60
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,959
How hard it's gonna be to take
care of three rug rats?

61
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,208
Okay. I know it's a lot
to take in.

62
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,917
Is it okay that
I'm a little bit excited?

63
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,500
As long as you don't expect
me to be.

64
00:02:58,542 --> 00:03:00,333
Ugh.

65
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:06,625
Okay.
This is gonna be awesome.

66
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:08,083
You've seen
plenty of ultrasounds.

67
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:09,750
Not when they're our kids

68
00:03:09,792 --> 00:03:11,166
and not when
they're the size of plums.

69
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:13,792
Oh, come on, Charlotte.
You know you're excited.

70
00:03:13,834 --> 00:03:15,667
All ultrasounds look the same.

71
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:18,041
They're like the sketches
of "america's most wanted."

72
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,041
You can't identify someone
from those.

73
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,041
All right.
There they are.

74
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:24,000
There's baby one,

75
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,583
baby two...

76
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:27,959
Oh, you see it, right?
Those are clearly our kids.

77
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,667
She has no idea
what she's talking about.

78
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:30,834
Hi, kids.

79
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,583
I made you.

80
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:33,792
This means I can't go
to the urology conference

81
00:03:33,834 --> 00:03:35,375
in Spain in October.

82
00:03:35,417 --> 00:03:37,792
We're not gonna be able to go
to Hawaii for Christmas.

83
00:03:37,834 --> 00:03:39,041
Oh, come on, Charlotte.
You're pregnant.

84
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,709
You're not terminally ill.

85
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,375
I'm gonna be a double-wide
with feet.

86
00:03:42,417 --> 00:03:44,041
More of you to love.

87
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,166
Look, all three look great.

88
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,709
You said with triplets,
one of 'em might not make it.

89
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,417
No, what I said was that
with multiples,

90
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:53,041
there's a 53% chance
of spontaneous reduction,

91
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:55,709
but since that usually happens
in the first trimester,

92
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,458
you are almost in the clear.

93
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,250
Yay for me.

94
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,500
Look, there are inherent risks
with carrying triplets to term.

95
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:04,041
We should go back to my office
and talk about it.

96
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,291
I have to get back
to the hospital.

97
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,625
No, what you need to do
is hire a new E.R. doc

98
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:10,208
and focus on the plums.

99
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,542
Sorry.

100
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:24,083
I'd, uh, just as soon
keep this to myself,

101
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:26,125
but since
that's not possible,

102
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,959
i'm, uh,

103
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,375
I'm pregnant...

104
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:31,709
With triplets.

105
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,792
Wow.
That's so wonderful.

106
00:04:32,834 --> 00:04:34,125
Congratulations!
That's so great. Yeah.

107
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,542
Okay, who already knew?

108
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:38,125
Time-out. If there's
a time and a place to lie,

109
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,625
it's right here and right now.

110
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:42,000
And don't you dare lie
to a pregnant woman.

111
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,000
Let's go, people.
Show of hands.

112
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:50,583
Ow!
Is it impossible for you
to keep your mouth shut?

113
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,917
You told Addison.
She's my doctor.

114
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,041
What's your excuse
for telling Violet?
Doesn't count.

115
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,875
Thanks, Coop.
You know what I mean.

116
00:04:56,917 --> 00:04:59,041
I'm sorry. I told Jake.
But only
so she could pick my brain

117
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,667
about pregnancy with multiples.

118
00:05:00,709 --> 00:05:02,792
I saw Cooper trolling
the Internet for baby names.

119
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:04,375
And not that you asked,

120
00:05:04,417 --> 00:05:07,041
but your kid will be pantsed
every day if you name him Otis.

121
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,125
And Coop was asking me

122
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,083
when Naomi started wearing
maternity clothes.

123
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,000
Mm.
You think I look fat?

124
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:14,041
No, you look beautiful.

125
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,083
Beautiful and fat,

126
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,583
but beautiful.

127
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,458
I may be the last one to know,

128
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,792
but this is fantastic news.

129
00:05:21,834 --> 00:05:25,083
Seriously. New life.
You--you must be so excited.

130
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,750
I'm excited about the odds
that my body might absorb

131
00:05:27,792 --> 00:05:29,917
at least one of these
freeloaders before birth.
That's terrible.

132
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,709
That's terrible.
That's Darwin.

133
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,959
Survival of the fittest.

134
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,125
You gonna find out the sex?

135
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,625
Well, the ultrasound
won't be definitive

136
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:37,041
until closer to 18 weeks.

137
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:38,625
If this technically wasn't
a high-risk pregnancy,

138
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:40,083
I wouldn't want to see
another ultrasound.

139
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,208
I mean, I want the mystery of
that. I want the anticipation.

140
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,542
I want to know
as soon as possible.

141
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:47,125
But I mean, it would be awesome
if it was a surprise, right?

142
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:49,041
I am pregnant with triplets.

143
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,125
That's surprise enough
for a lifetime.

144
00:05:53,792 --> 00:05:55,083
So we're having triplets.

145
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,667
Great.
Congratulations, man.

146
00:05:57,709 --> 00:06:01,041
I threw out almost everything
or donated it to charity.

147
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:04,542
But I still have
Pete's toothbrush.

148
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:07,041
I can't stop thinking
about babies...
I haven't touched it.

149
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:10,125
But babies are life, and Violet
wants to talk about death.
The bristles are all worn down
and there's even

150
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,750
that little stain of dried
toothpaste underneath it.
I need to focus.
I need to focus on death.

151
00:06:12,792 --> 00:06:14,375
And I just stare at it
every morning...

152
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:15,834
It sounds wrong, doesn't it?
In the bathroom.

153
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,375
I don't know.

154
00:06:17,417 --> 00:06:19,583
I mean, I know he's not actually
gonna come back to use it,

155
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:22,834
but it just makes me
feel better to see it there,

156
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,625
next to mine on a sink.

157
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:25,583
Whatever works, right?

158
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,041
That's right.

159
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,625
Don't you think--

160
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:30,458
I mean, shouldn't you be
talking to someone?

161
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,709
I'm talking to you.

162
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,667
Come--

163
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:35,041
I mean--i mean,
I have grief group,

164
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:37,458
which sort of helps.

165
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,709
I guess. I don't know.
Look, I mean,

166
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,500
Pete is dead, and, um...

167
00:06:44,834 --> 00:06:46,625
And that sucks.

168
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:49,000
It's gonna suck
until it doesn't.

169
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:52,041
Oh, I'm so sorry, vi.
Okay.

170
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,166
She's mourning the loss
of her husband,

171
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,375
and he was my friend.

172
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:59,917
I just can't go there right now.
I am in baby land.

173
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:01,875
I mean, I want to be doing
cartwheels, which is funny,

174
00:07:01,917 --> 00:07:04,333
'cause I've never done
a cartwheel in my whole life.

175
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:07,417
I need to stop this.
Okay, her husband is dead.

176
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,500
I cannot show her my baby glee.

177
00:07:09,542 --> 00:07:13,542
I need to smile and nod
and pretend I'm listening.

178
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,500
Okay.

179
00:07:16,542 --> 00:07:18,083
Thanks. Thanks, Cooper.

180
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,917
For what?
For listening.

181
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,458
All right.
All right.

182
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,500
I'm gonna be late
for my group.
Okay.

183
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:30,625
She thanked me for listening.

184
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:32,542
I wasn't listening.

185
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:34,583
I'm a bad friend.
I mean, she needs help.

186
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:38,291
She is suffering,
and i'm... just an ass.

187
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,542
I mean, go.
Go--go be with Violet.

188
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:43,542
Seriously, I'm good. Go.

189
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,041
Violet?

190
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,125
You're not in grief group.

191
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,000
Gabi, hi.

192
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:51,667
Uh, yeah, I was
checking on a patient.

193
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:53,041
Guess I lost track of time.

194
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,959
Oh, me, too.
I was visiting ally.

195
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,583
I didn't know
she was at St. ambrose.

196
00:07:56,625 --> 00:08:00,667
Yeah. This is like my second
home. I'm here every day.

197
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:02,458
You know, I read to her,
play music.

198
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,000
You know, just let her know
I love her.

199
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:05,709
That's really nice.

200
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:10,542
Well, if we go now,
we won't be too late.

201
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:13,125
Is it awful
that I wanna play hooky?

202
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,291
Oh, god. No.

203
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,500
It's hard, the work
that we do over there.

204
00:08:17,542 --> 00:08:20,333
Yeah, it's also hard to hear
over Kasey's sobbing.

205
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,583
That's terrible.
I'm sorry.

206
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,917
No, just the actual number of
tissues that she uses, you know,

207
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:28,208
like a whole box, really?

208
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,500
What about the rest of us?

209
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:30,750
Yeah,
but it's also that there's

210
00:08:30,792 --> 00:08:31,959
a kind of pecking order,
you know?

211
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,583
I mean, I know I'm entitled
to miss my girlfriend,

212
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:38,792
but her son was like,
what, 26 when he died?

213
00:08:38,834 --> 00:08:40,291
How do you compete
with that?

214
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:41,583
You play hooky.

215
00:08:44,834 --> 00:08:46,583
Do you want company?

216
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,000
Okay, everything looks good.

217
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,875
The first trimester tests
came back

218
00:08:49,917 --> 00:08:52,667
negative for trisomy 13 and 18,

219
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:54,166
which means it's unlikely
that the kids

220
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:56,041
will have
any chromosomal abnormalities.

221
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,333
We can go ahead and do an amnio
at 16 weeks to be sure.

222
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,834
Sounds great.

223
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,041
Right, char?

224
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,375
Fantastic. Are we done?

225
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,375
No. No. We have to discuss
your options.

226
00:09:05,417 --> 00:09:07,166
No, I know my options.

227
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,542
I'd like to hear the options.

228
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,667
With multiples,
there's a very high probability

229
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:15,792
of preterm delivery, resulting
in low birthweight infants,

230
00:09:15,834 --> 00:09:17,917
which are at risk.
I know what
they're at risk for.

231
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:19,792
A dead mother.
That's what they're at risk for,

232
00:09:19,834 --> 00:09:22,458
because I just may kill her
right now.

233
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,083
The problem is,
she's carrying my babies,

234
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,417
so I guess I should wait.

235
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,583
Ideally,
we want to get 32 weeks.

236
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,208
That gives the babies
the best chance.

237
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,583
Anything before 26 weeks,

238
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,041
and you're looking
at the possibility

239
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,208
of cognitive
and neurological impairments.

240
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,500
Great. Got it.

241
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:37,041
You did your job.

242
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:45,375
She has to understand the risks.
Can--can you talk to her?

243
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:47,500
Tell me
what we need to know.

244
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,458
Can't sleep?

245
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,041
Ah, bloodsucking ticks are
giving me heartburn.

246
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:09,125
Can't wait till
they keep me up kickboxing.

247
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,709
Anything I can do?

248
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,041
Hmm. Go back in time,

249
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,875
wear a condom.

250
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,959
So I was talking to Addison
this afternoon after you left.

251
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,333
And with triplets,
you're looking at a lot

252
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:25,583
of possible
obstetric complications.

253
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,792
Remember when you asked if there
was anything you could do?

254
00:10:28,834 --> 00:10:30,250
Stop talking.

255
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,542
You're at risk
for preterm labor,

256
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,041
premature ruptured membranes,

257
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,041
gestational diabetes,
preeclampsia,

258
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:38,500
and postpartum hemorrhaging,

259
00:10:38,542 --> 00:10:40,500
which means you could die,
Charlotte.

260
00:10:40,542 --> 00:10:43,041
Cooper, I'm a doctor.
I know what I'm at risk for.

261
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,375
Oh, my god. I take back
the whole killing her thing.
I know
the possible complications.

262
00:10:45,417 --> 00:10:47,125
Okay?
Quit being so dramatic.

263
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,375
Is it gone?

264
00:10:48,417 --> 00:10:50,333
Quit being so dramatic.

265
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:53,583
I think we need to talk about
selective reduction.

266
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:55,750
How many times do I have to say
I don't need to hear this?

267
00:10:55,792 --> 00:10:57,542
Reduction from triplets
to twins,

268
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,959
decreases the risk
of severe prematurity

269
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,917
and the risk
of losing the whole pregnancy

270
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,750
falls from 15% to 4%.

271
00:11:04,792 --> 00:11:06,083
I won't abort.

272
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:11,709
You were hoping that one of them
would be absorbed anyway.

273
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,750
What's the difference?

274
00:11:12,792 --> 00:11:14,709
Absorbed is
my higher power at work.

275
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,000
Abortion is
me making the call.

276
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:19,959
Selective reduction
isn't exactly abortion.

277
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,625
It's a shot to the heart
of a fetus

278
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:23,208
with potassium chloride.

279
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,041
You know how you pick?

280
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:28,041
Whichever one's closest.
That's who gets the needle.

281
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,917
I'm not doing that.

282
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,250
I have to pee.

283
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,333
Okay, that's horrible,

284
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,375
but if losing one means
you can save two,

285
00:11:47,417 --> 00:11:52,041
if losing one means Charlotte
would be okay? I don't know.

286
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,458
I don't know. I'm the dad,
so I should have a say,

287
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,834
but right now mom's doing
all the hard work.

288
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:03,458
It's Charlotte's body,
it's her life, it's her choice.

289
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,709
But I can't lose her and I don't
want to lose any of my babies.

290
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:12,500
So what the hell do I do?

291
00:12:12,542 --> 00:12:15,041
What do I do?

292
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:18,583
Cooper.

293
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:21,709
We told Mason he was
having three siblings.

294
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,709
Then Mason's having
three siblings.

295
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:46,667
Wow. They have
a lot of strollers here.

296
00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:49,125
Mm-hmm.
Yes. Oh. Here you go.
Look at this one.

297
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,875
No. Baby in the front
will be 3 miles away.

298
00:12:51,917 --> 00:12:53,458
I won't be able to see it.
Someone could snatch it

299
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,208
and I wouldn't know till,
like, an hour later.

300
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,542
Well, I-I can help.
She's insane. Right?
I mean, it's 3 feet.

301
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:00,041
Unless she's legally blind,
she'll be able to spot danger.
I mean I could walk,
like, in front

302
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,250
with one of the babies.
You're gonna make a hell
of a big brother.

303
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,083
Can I help you folks?

304
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:07,041
Yes. We are looking
for strollers, but, um,

305
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,917
there's a lot
to choose from.

306
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,500
We have some excellent models,

307
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:14,250
but the truth is, it's really
best to carry the baby

308
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:16,291
and hold them close.
I did that with mine.

309
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,458
Yeah, well, I'm pregnant
with triplets,

310
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,125
so how do I hold all three
at the same time?

311
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:24,250
Do you put one in a basket
on your head? Or--or maybe

312
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,041
with three it doesn't really
matter if I drop one

313
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,166
now and again,
'cause I've got spares.

314
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,041
Oh, good. She's making friends.
You don't really
mean that, right?

315
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,041
I'll bet this lady wishes
she called in sick today.
I can help with the babies.

316
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,291
I can carry one.
Thank you for your help.

317
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:36,166
Uh, we'll let you know
if we need anything. Thanks.

318
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,709
With my luck, she'll be waiting
for me in the breast pump aisle

319
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,083
so she can tell me how
she nursed all of her kids

320
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,083
until they're 27.

321
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:45,375
Ew! People really do that?
No.

322
00:13:45,417 --> 00:13:47,208
When you're pregnant,
everyone's got an opinion,

323
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,041
and they all
wanna offer advice.

324
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:51,041
Okay, does someone need
a hug? Three...

325
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,834
Two...
One.

326
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,208
Who's cranky?

327
00:13:57,417 --> 00:13:58,750
You can let go.
All right.

328
00:13:58,792 --> 00:14:01,291
You can stay.
Okay.

329
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:06,542
You didn't talk about Lucas
in group today. How's he doing?

330
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:09,291
He doesn't ask about Pete
anymore.

331
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,583
I'm worried that he won't
remember his dad,

332
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:14,041
but sometimes I think
that's better.

333
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:17,333
Sure. If you don't remember,
there's nothing to miss.

334
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:20,041
Maybe that's what I need--
amnesia.

335
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,458
Although I'm already
starting to forget things.

336
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,583
Like what?

337
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,375
Our first date,
ally and I went

338
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:29,041
to this hole-in-the-wall
restaurant in Mexico

339
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,834
while we were working
down there.

340
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,875
I was writing
for "national geographic."

341
00:14:32,917 --> 00:14:35,375
She was taking
the pictures.

342
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:37,875
I've been racking my brain
for the past three days,

343
00:14:37,917 --> 00:14:40,041
but I can't recall
the name of the place.

344
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,041
Ally would know.

345
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:45,166
But she hasn't
answered me in a while.

346
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:46,250
I am so sorry.

347
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:49,291
I can't imagine
how hard this is for you.

348
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:53,375
I keep hoping that
I can will her to wake up.

349
00:14:53,417 --> 00:14:56,834
None of the doctors can agree
as to when that might be.

350
00:14:56,875 --> 00:15:00,875
But as long
as a chance exists,

351
00:15:00,917 --> 00:15:03,041
I can't give up.

352
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,125
I won't.

353
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:11,208
They are beautiful!

354
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,917
Oh, my--I'm so excited
for you guys. This is amazing.

355
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:16,041
Amazing? I can't have
too much coffee.

356
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,667
I can't eat Sushi. I'm supposed
to watch my Mercury levels

357
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,875
and be on the lookout for
toxoplasma, listeria, e.Coli.

358
00:15:20,917 --> 00:15:22,500
Yeah, she should keep
complaining to Amelia...

359
00:15:22,542 --> 00:15:24,917
About pregnancy because
it must've been really fun

360
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,417
to go through the nine months

361
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,125
and then give birth to a baby
with no brain.

362
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:30,083
...and even herbal tea.
Herbal tea.

363
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,250
And then the damn shopping
has to get done

364
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:33,500
before they get here--

365
00:15:33,542 --> 00:15:35,083
the bottles, the diapers.

366
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,458
And what the hell's a layette?

367
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,083
I can't even go
to the store anymore, though,

368
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:41,333
because I'm so gassy and itchy--
my boobs, my bump.

369
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:45,125
I don't have time for this crap.
I have a job. Two jobs.

370
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,542
You know, if we threw you
a shower--

371
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,208
no.
Come on. Think about it.
It could be fun.

372
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,709
Charlotte hates showers.
Come on. Think about it.
It could be fun.

373
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,083
Mostly she hates the women
that have showers...
We can stuff our faces
with great food...

374
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:54,917
Because they're
all that woman...

375
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,709
You know, the ones that think
the world needs to stop

376
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,166
because they're pregnant,

377
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,041
like they're the first ones
to ever do that.

378
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,792
...sugary baked goods.

379
00:16:01,834 --> 00:16:05,000
I hate showers.
You know who has showers?

380
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,875
That woman--the one I hate,

381
00:16:06,917 --> 00:16:08,083
the one who thinks
the world's gotta stop

382
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,750
because she's having a baby.

383
00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:10,917
Like she's the first
one to ever do it.

384
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,291
Okay, first of all,
there is no danger

385
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,875
of you ever becoming
that woman.

386
00:16:14,917 --> 00:16:19,041
Second, you do realize that you
need everything in triplicate.

387
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,083
So if I throw you a shower,

388
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:21,333
you won't have to worry
about any of it.

389
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:22,709
I'll register for you,

390
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,875
and by the time the babies
are born,

391
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:25,125
you'll have
everything you need.

392
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:28,041
So you can be gassy
in the comfort of your own home.

393
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,166
So really,
you're just buying me stuff?

394
00:16:30,792 --> 00:16:32,041
Okay.

395
00:16:35,834 --> 00:16:38,125
What she meant to say was
"thank you."

396
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,917
20 minutes for you,
30 for me,

397
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,834
and ten minutes for
"American bake off."

398
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,792
Uh...
Okay, I'll give you five
in "bake off,"

399
00:16:48,834 --> 00:16:52,333
but my 30 is nonnegotiable.
I need every minute of it.

400
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:53,792
What are we talking about?

401
00:16:53,834 --> 00:16:56,000
Us, commiserating
about our lives

402
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:58,041
over corned beef
on marble rye.

403
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,083
Right. Lunch.

404
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:01,583
I totally forgot.

405
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:02,834
Did you forget?

406
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,041
Of course not.
You forgot.

407
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,667
I forgot.

408
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:07,250
And Addison's about to do
Charlotte's ultrasound

409
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,583
in, like, ten minutes.
I didn't tell you that?
No.

410
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,625
Oh, my god.
Please don't let her be mad.
It must have slipped
your mind.

411
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:13,667
I mean, I just can't handle that
right now.
Which is understandable...

412
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:15,125
I just want to see
my little sweet potatoes.
Given what you've got
going on.

413
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,625
You're not mad, are you?

414
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:17,875
I'm furious.

415
00:17:17,917 --> 00:17:19,625
Yeah, blow off
your wife's ultrasound

416
00:17:19,667 --> 00:17:21,500
and have lunch with me.

417
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:27,000
You know, if you still want one,
we can do an amnio.

418
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,041
No.

419
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:29,041
I realize that there are
associated risks,

420
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,959
but I do know
what I'm doing.

421
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,875
Oh, it doesn't matter. Even
if an amnio tells us each kid

422
00:17:33,917 --> 00:17:37,041
has two heads and is covered in
gills, they're still our babies

423
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:40,291
and they'll stay our babies.

424
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,583
Mm.

425
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:44,417
Hi, king-freedmans
or Freedman-kings.

426
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,041
Did you miss me?

427
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,291
Well, how could they miss you?
You talk to 'em every damn day.

428
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,166
Okay, so there's
baby number one.
I read in one
of the pregnancy books

429
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,208
that if you talk
to your children every day...
Two, you can see his hand...

430
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,417
They're more secure
and well-adjusted.
And then baby number three...

431
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,041
I don't know. At least
they'll know me right away.

432
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,041
Is hiding
behind the other two.

433
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,041
It is pretty crowded in there,

434
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:03,583
but your girls...

435
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,417
Look good.
Girls?

436
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,041
All three of 'em?
All three of 'em.

437
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:10,208
Girls are awesome!

438
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,125
Oh, my god!

439
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:13,959
Oh, man!
Oh!

440
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,333
What the hell am I gonna do
with three girls?

441
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:26,959
Charlotte?

442
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,333
You okay?

443
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:34,625
It's 7:00 P.M.

444
00:18:34,667 --> 00:18:36,125
I'm tired.

445
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,959
I'm always tired.

446
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,875
It's because
I don't sleep anymore.

447
00:18:40,917 --> 00:18:43,875
Everything's tight.
My socks are tight.

448
00:18:43,917 --> 00:18:45,041
My towels are tight.

449
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,041
The freaking mangoes are
making me miserable.

450
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,917
You'd never know because she's
so shy about her discontent.

451
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:52,041
Really keeps it all inside.

452
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,500
And i'm
doing this for girls.

453
00:18:54,542 --> 00:18:56,041
Why do they all
have to be girls?

454
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,125
Girls are awesome.

455
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,041
You were a girl.

456
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,500
Ah.

457
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:03,875
Girls...

458
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:07,291
Are silly and stupid.

459
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,041
When they turn 12,
we're giving them away

460
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,792
because 12-year-old girls make
Stalin look like Gandhi.

461
00:19:12,959 --> 00:19:15,917
Sure, they're disgustingly sweet
to their daddies,

462
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:20,041
but girls hate their mamas
from puberty to at least age 20.

463
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:24,166
Mm. The only thing that's worse
is when they become women.

464
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:28,041
Sure, they'll talk your ear off
about sisterhood

465
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,041
while simultaneously
stabbing you in the back

466
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:32,083
and sleeping with your husband.
Women are awful.

467
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,041
You're not awful.
You're perfect.

468
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:36,083
And you will raise them
to be just like you.

469
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,792
Mm.

470
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:39,709
And then hopefully,
they will each meet a man

471
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,834
as patient and selfless
as I am.

472
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,625
Although, I probably won't let
them date until they're 30

473
00:19:44,667 --> 00:19:46,834
because before I was selfless
and patient,

474
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,959
I was a man-whore who knocked
a woman up in a parking lot

475
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:52,667
and met my wife
on a sex site.

476
00:19:52,709 --> 00:19:55,959
I have my work cut out for me,
don't I?

477
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,041
Thanks for taking a look.

478
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,458
I know that ally's
on life support,

479
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,041
but what are the odds
that she--

480
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:04,000
no, there are no odds.
Ally has no cortical activity.

481
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,875
I'm gonna have a hard time
imagining

482
00:20:05,917 --> 00:20:08,125
any doctor saying otherwise.
I mean, she's brain-dead.

483
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:11,333
She's not waking up ever.
I'm sorry, Violet.

484
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,333
What are you doing?

485
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,959
Hey, gabi.
Uh, this is Dr. Shepherd.

486
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,041
She's a neurosurgeon
and a friend.

487
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,834
I didn't ask you
to get another opinion.

488
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,917
No, I realize that. But I just
thought that since she's here--

489
00:20:22,959 --> 00:20:26,000
get out, both of you.

490
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,166
All right,
what about this one?

491
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:37,917
There's a swimming pool
in the back,

492
00:20:37,959 --> 00:20:40,458
a 6-car garage,
and 8 bedrooms.

493
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,834
Okay. How much?

494
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:44,000
$15 million.

495
00:20:45,542 --> 00:20:46,667
Is--is that too much?

496
00:20:46,709 --> 00:20:49,000
No, not if we win
the lottery.

497
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,041
Okay, what about this one?
See, five bedrooms,

498
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:54,375
big backyard.

499
00:20:54,417 --> 00:20:57,041
We could build a tree house.

500
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:04,041
I thought I'd surprise Charlotte
with a house.

501
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:05,750
Who am I kidding?
This is Los Angeles.

502
00:21:05,792 --> 00:21:07,542
We can't afford a house
for this brood.

503
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:10,291
Maybe if all the kids
share rooms.

504
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,041
Will their friends
make fun of them

505
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,041
for not having their own space?
Maybe they won't have friends.

506
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,959
Maybe if we don't buy
the $15-million house

507
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,041
with the pool,
they'll be shunned.

508
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:21,834
It doesn't just happen
with the amish, right?

509
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:24,041
It kinda looks haunted.

510
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,041
Oh. Yeah.

511
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:27,959
Well, the good news is,
if you have to share your room

512
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,375
with a ghost, he won't
take up much space.

513
00:21:36,792 --> 00:21:38,041
Hey, when the babies come,

514
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:41,542
are you gonna like them
more than me?

515
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,458
Mason.

516
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,041
I mean, it happens.

517
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:47,041
People like babies.
Babies are cute.

518
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:48,583
I spend a lot of time
with babies,

519
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:50,333
and they can be
quite disgusting.

520
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,041
They got bald,
little pointy heads.

521
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,917
All they do is eat, sleep,
poop, and cry.

522
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:56,041
I mean, you're way more fun
that that.

523
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,041
Really?

524
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,083
Really. And besides,

525
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:01,625
we're gonna be the only dudes
in that house.

526
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:03,542
We gotta stick together.

527
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:05,041
Right?

528
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:07,917
Our survival depends on it.

529
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,041
Welcome, mommies and daddies,

530
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:21,041
to the incredible journey
of childbirth.

531
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:23,291
Let's start with
some breathing exercises.

532
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,166
Dads, prop up your wives

533
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:27,834
so they can focus
on their diaphragms.

534
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:29,208
Just like that.

535
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,041
Good. Get comfy.

536
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,291
Okay.

537
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:35,375
Now take a slow, deep inhale
through the nose.

538
00:22:36,709 --> 00:22:39,041
Followed by
a long, slow exhale

539
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:41,041
out through the mouth.

540
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:44,041
Like these people really
don't know how to breathe.

541
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:47,041
Breathe in love...

542
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:48,875
And breathe out fear.

543
00:22:48,917 --> 00:22:51,041
Ugh.
For crying out loud.

544
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:52,792
It's hard for me
to breathe in love

545
00:22:52,834 --> 00:22:54,375
when you're being
so negative.

546
00:22:54,417 --> 00:22:56,166
Showtime.

547
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,041
That's what
you're worried about?

548
00:22:58,083 --> 00:23:00,291
Once you bear down to push
an enormous head

549
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:02,458
through a not-quite-big-enough
opening

550
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,041
that no amount
of kegel exercises

551
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:05,875
will ever whip back
into shape,

552
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:07,041
you won't give a rat's ass

553
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:08,458
whether or not
you paid attention

554
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,834
during breathing exercises.

555
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:11,000
You're gonna be too busy
screaming for drugs

556
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:11,875
and wishing
that son of a bitch

557
00:23:11,917 --> 00:23:13,667
who knocked you up
had never been born.

558
00:23:13,709 --> 00:23:16,917
Ladies and gentlemen,
my fabulous wife.

559
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:19,667
You're all doing great. Another
five minutes of breathing,

560
00:23:19,709 --> 00:23:20,917
and we can move on
to some ball work.

561
00:23:20,959 --> 00:23:22,875
Which is what got us
here in the first place.

562
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:26,625
Good job.
Keep breathing.

563
00:23:26,667 --> 00:23:29,458
Yeah, this one--
think maybe a Turkey baster.

564
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,834
Oh. Missionary position.
Lights off,

565
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:34,000
blinds drawn, two minutes,
and done.

566
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:38,208
What about the creepy twins?

567
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:42,041
Oh. Sex swing
and a ball gag for sure.

568
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:44,041
Shh.
Are you two going to ruin

569
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:46,667
this beautiful experience
for everybody?

570
00:23:46,709 --> 00:23:48,709
Honey, lighten up.
That's it.

571
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:49,917

asked me if it was okay for her
to be having sex

588
00:24:31,834 --> 00:24:33,083
this far along
in her pregnancy.

589
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:34,875
How far along is she?

590
00:24:34,917 --> 00:24:37,041
Uh, like, you know,
second trimester-y.

591
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:39,083
Wait. Doesn't her o.B.
Have that covered?

592
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:40,792
I don't think she likes him,

593
00:24:40,834 --> 00:24:42,041
and apparently, she saw
this thing on the Internet

594
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:44,041
of this woman
who experienced sex

595
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:45,709
and then went into labor early,

596
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,333
and the baby wasn't
fully cooked.
Dude, it's sick.

597
00:24:47,375 --> 00:24:51,083
I hope that was her word
and not yours.

598
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:54,041
Did she, uh, did she experience
any discomfort?

599
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:56,041
Not that she mentioned.
Is it a high-risk pregnancy?

600
00:24:56,083 --> 00:24:57,208
It's...

601
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,041
Multiples. I think
it's multiples, so...

602
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:02,625
Oh, really? So, uh, when did
you and Charlotte have sex?

603
00:25:03,667 --> 00:25:05,291
Like a week ago.

604
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:06,792
What are you doing
trolling the Internet

605
00:25:06,834 --> 00:25:08,125
for medical advice anyway?
It's not my fault.

606
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:10,125
It's al Gore's fault
for inventing the Internet,

607
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:12,083
and all those people that
make it this horrible place

608
00:25:12,125 --> 00:25:15,166
where all my darkest fears are
so conveniently realized.

609
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:17,291
Charlotte is fine.
If anything was gonna go wrong,

610
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:20,166
it would've happened by now.
But since you are at 22 weeks,

611
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:22,041
you know, it might be a good
idea to keep it in your pants.

612
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:25,041
Yeah. Charlotte's not the one
to worry about.

613
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:27,542
Uh, you're already at what,
stage one daddy freak-out.

614
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:30,041
Just wait
until the babies come.
Stop it. I'm a pediatrician.

615
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:31,417
Yeah, who's worried
that he might induce labor

616
00:25:31,458 --> 00:25:32,959
with his little Cooper.

617
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,041
Okay.

618
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:36,750
I'm around kids all day.

619
00:25:36,792 --> 00:25:38,667
Charlotte runs the hospital.

620
00:25:38,709 --> 00:25:42,208
We're prepared.
No, you're
never fully prepared.

621
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,250
Plus, you're having three.
You're gonna be outnumbered.

622
00:25:44,291 --> 00:25:46,583
Dr. Cooper Freedman,
pediatrician.

623
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:48,041
No, it's different.

624
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:50,000
How?
It just is.

625
00:25:50,041 --> 00:25:51,041
That's deep.

626
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:53,041
Look, my advice?
Cancel the Internet.

627
00:25:53,083 --> 00:25:56,041
Okay. I make this, I'm gonna be
officially recognized

628
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:59,041
as the best,
most prepared father

629
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:01,750
in history of the world.

630
00:26:01,792 --> 00:26:03,917
Get it! Two out of three.
Two out of three.
All right. Try again.

631
00:26:03,959 --> 00:26:06,083
Two, one. Freedman!

632
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:19,834
It's been a long time
since I've made a new friend.

633
00:26:19,875 --> 00:26:23,041
You know, a real friend.

634
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:26,458
And I know by getting a consult
for ally, I overstepped,

635
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,834
but, um, I think of you
as a friend,

636
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:31,041
and I wanted to help.

637
00:26:31,083 --> 00:26:33,041
I'm sorry.

638
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:35,041
We are.

639
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:36,458
We are friends.

640
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,083
But you have to understand,
two doctors told me

641
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:42,083
the same thing that
your friend did months ago.

642
00:26:42,125 --> 00:26:44,041
But I...

643
00:26:44,083 --> 00:26:46,083
I couldn't hear it.

644
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:49,041
So I went to see a psychic--
which is insane, I know--

645
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:52,041
but she said
there was hope.

646
00:26:52,083 --> 00:26:54,041
I understand
wanting to hold on, I do,

647
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:57,125
but at a certain point...

648
00:26:57,166 --> 00:26:59,125
Was Pete
the love of your life?

649
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:05,041
Ally is.

650
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:09,000
I was married
to a wonderful man

651
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:10,125
for eight and a half years.

652
00:27:10,166 --> 00:27:11,917
He was my best friend.

653
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:16,250
And I didn't know that there
could be more until I met ally.

654
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:18,458
And that kind of love?

655
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,667
I can't even tell you
how she made me feel.

656
00:27:20,709 --> 00:27:24,041
But I felt that way every day
for ten years.

657
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:27,000
Every single day.

658
00:27:27,041 --> 00:27:29,041
And if I pull the plug,

659
00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:31,041
if--if she's gone,

660
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:33,667
really gone,

661
00:27:33,709 --> 00:27:37,834
I'm afraid that no one will
ever love me like that again.

662
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,208
And who thinks like that?

663
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:45,834
I mean, she's the one
lying there, stuck in limbo,

664
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:48,125
and I'm worried about me.

665
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:51,166
I'm a terrible person.

666
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:56,291
When Pete died,
I felt relieved.

667
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:58,333
I've never told that
to anybody,

668
00:27:58,375 --> 00:28:02,041
never said it out loud.

669
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:07,041
I mean, I miss him. I do. I miss
him all the time, every day.

670
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:09,375
But Pete was...

671
00:28:09,417 --> 00:28:12,041
Pete.

672
00:28:12,083 --> 00:28:15,208
He was complicated
and difficult,

673
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:18,041
and I tried for so long
to work out our issues,

674
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:20,041
and...

675
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:22,583
I mean, the thing was,
we don't have issues anymore.

676
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:24,166
You know, he won't fight,
he won't leave,

677
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:27,834
because Pete is--is...

678
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:29,041
Pete's dead.

679
00:28:31,166 --> 00:28:33,250
The argument is over.

680
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:38,834
So yeah, yeah, he--

681
00:28:38,875 --> 00:28:40,250
he was the love of my life,

682
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:42,250
and it--and it hurts
that he's gone,

683
00:28:42,291 --> 00:28:46,625
but I felt r-relief.

684
00:28:46,667 --> 00:28:48,208
I'm...

685
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:50,083
I'm relieved.

686
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:55,041
She is the love of my life,

687
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:58,041
and I don't feel relieved.

688
00:28:58,083 --> 00:29:01,083
I just want her back.

689
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,041
Isaac invited me

690
00:29:14,083 --> 00:29:16,041
to his brother's bar mitzvah
next month.

691
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:17,333
Can I go?

692
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:18,333
Sure.

693
00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:20,417
Am I gonna have
one of those?

694
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:22,250
Do you wanna be Jewish?

695
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:24,083
I don't know. Maybe.

696
00:29:24,125 --> 00:29:26,041
Well, that's cool if it's
something you wanna do.

697
00:29:26,083 --> 00:29:28,125
You can pave the way
for the triplets.

698
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:29,291
We're raising them Jewish?

699
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:31,542
Uh, I know we haven't talked
about it,

700
00:29:31,583 --> 00:29:33,500
but I was thinking... maybe.

701
00:29:33,542 --> 00:29:34,834
Well,
you don't go to temple.

702
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:37,041
But those traditions are
part of who I am,

703
00:29:37,083 --> 00:29:39,041
and that spiritual heritage is

704
00:29:39,083 --> 00:29:41,250
something I want
for the children.
Well, so do I,

705
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:43,041
which is why I think
they should be baptized.

706
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:45,500
W--
if they aren't baptized,
they won't go to heaven.

707
00:29:45,542 --> 00:29:47,875
I still have the gown
I was christened in...
Okay, I know I eat pork
and shellfish...

708
00:29:47,917 --> 00:29:49,667
And I don't feel
I need to go to Israel...
Beautiful lace dress
my grandmother made by hand.

709
00:29:49,709 --> 00:29:51,166
And I married a Christian,
so one could argue

710
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:53,166
that I should be flexible...
My mother
was baptized in it, too.

711
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,041
When it comes
to religious instruction.
So were my brothers.

712
00:29:55,083 --> 00:29:57,250
But baptism? No way.
I know it's somewhere safe
at mama's house.

713
00:29:57,291 --> 00:29:59,917
All my ancestors would roll over
in their graves.

714
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:01,959
My mom took me to church
sometimes,

715
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,750
like, for Christmas,
easter, too.

716
00:30:03,792 --> 00:30:05,792
Well, those services
are nice, right?

717
00:30:05,834 --> 00:30:07,083
I want the babies to wake up
on Christmas morning

718
00:30:07,125 --> 00:30:08,583
to presents
under a tree.

719
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:10,083
I want to hide
easter eggs.

720
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:12,166
Okay, I don't think we should
base our children's religion

721
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:15,083
on what the most entertaining
holidays are.

722
00:30:15,125 --> 00:30:17,041
Why not?
Because that is a battle
I would totally lose.

723
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:19,041
I mean, what's wrong
with being entertained?
I mean, nobody wants to fast
at yom kippur.

724
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:21,041
Isn't having fun important?
And you eat matzo
and you don't poop for a week.

725
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:23,041
Although christianity
isn't all fun and games.
Like playing video games.

726
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:24,792
The son of god gets nailed
to a cross...
Does either religion
have a holiday...

727
00:30:24,834 --> 00:30:26,125
And his father loved him.
Where you get to play
video games all day?

728
00:30:26,166 --> 00:30:28,041
How does that not give a kid
nightmares?

729
00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:29,125
Video game day.

730
00:30:29,166 --> 00:30:30,417
That would be so cool.

731
00:30:30,458 --> 00:30:32,041
Or we could expose them
to both religions.

732
00:30:32,083 --> 00:30:35,041
Let them decide.
Doesn't that seem confusing?

733
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:38,917
I'm not confused.
Two religions, twice the gifts.

734
00:30:38,959 --> 00:30:39,959
Think about it, Coop.

735
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
We got plenty of time.

736
00:30:47,667 --> 00:30:50,125
It's too soon! They're only
lettuce! They won't make it!

737
00:30:50,166 --> 00:30:52,083
It's gonna be okay, Charlotte.
It'll be okay.

738
00:30:52,125 --> 00:30:54,000
Dr. Montgomery's
five minutes out.

739
00:30:54,041 --> 00:30:55,458
We'll need a b.O.A. Kit
and an o.B. Bed.

740
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,166
And give her nifedipine,
10 milligrams.

741
00:30:57,208 --> 00:30:59,417
I'm only 26 weeks!
You gotta stop the labor!

742
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,208
Addison's gonna take care
of everything. Don't worry.

743
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:03,208
Is she gonna be okay?
She's gonna be fine. Okay?

744
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,041
You remember nurse Fiona? You go
to school with her daughter.

745
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:06,250
Okay, Amelia's gonna come
and pick you up.

746
00:31:06,291 --> 00:31:08,000
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

747
00:31:08,041 --> 00:31:09,166
Labor's not supposed to be
for another six weeks,

748
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:11,125
and I was gonna bring her
ice chips and rub her back

749
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:13,041
and all the babies
were gonna be healthy

750
00:31:13,083 --> 00:31:15,000
and Charlotte was
gonna be incredibly happy

751
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:16,166
because she would've known
that I would've done

752
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:19,041
everything I could to keep her
and the baby safe.

753
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:21,458
It wasn't supposed to
be like this.

754
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,458
Charlotte. Come on.

755
00:31:30,625 --> 00:31:32,709
I started
the tocolytics,

756
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:35,083
but she's still laboring.
Okay, Charlotte,
let's see what's going on here.

757
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:37,208
What? What is it?

758
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:39,625
One of the triplets is
presenting as a footling breach.

759
00:31:39,667 --> 00:31:41,500
We need to deliver right now.
The lungs
ar-aren't developed.

760
00:31:41,542 --> 00:31:43,792
We don't have a choice.
I need three resuscitation kits

761
00:31:43,834 --> 00:31:45,375
and three incubators.

762
00:31:45,417 --> 00:31:47,917
Let the nicu know they could be
getting up to 3 26-weekers.

763
00:31:47,959 --> 00:31:49,208
Okay, Charlotte, we're gonna
start delivering now.

764
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:51,375
Okay? You ready? Let's go.

765
00:31:53,291 --> 00:31:54,500
Good.

766
00:31:54,542 --> 00:31:57,709
Good. Good. There you go.

767
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:00,041
Aah!

768
00:32:00,083 --> 00:32:02,041
Aah.

769
00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:05,291
2.5 tube and a straight blade.

770
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:07,041
What's happening?
Addison's working on it.

771
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:09,041
- Addison?
- Charlotte, I'm going to examine you

772
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:11,125
to see if the remaining
membranes are intact, okay?

773
00:32:11,166 --> 00:32:13,333
Okay. Okay.
It's okay.

774
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:20,208
Is she breathing?
Why--why isn't she crying?

775
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:22,041
All right. Come on, kid.
Help me out here.

776
00:32:22,083 --> 00:32:23,625
Okay, the membranes are intact,
and if the meds

777
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:25,083
that Dr. Peterson gave you
worked, then--

778
00:32:25,125 --> 00:32:26,917
what? Then what?
The contractions
will stop.

779
00:32:26,959 --> 00:32:29,041
Until 32 weeks?

780
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:30,500
Because these babies
aren't ready to be delivered.

781
00:32:30,542 --> 00:32:32,291
I can stitch up your cervix.
What?

782
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:33,458
That'll delay delivery
for a few weeks,

783
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,291
give the other babies
a chance to mature.

784
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:36,500
Jake, is that safe?

785
00:32:36,542 --> 00:32:37,875
There are significant risks.

786
00:32:37,917 --> 00:32:40,375
Maternal morbidity in delayed
interval birth is about 30%.

787
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:42,291
Charlotte could die?

788
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:44,583
How is she?
She's got ectopia cordis.

789
00:32:44,625 --> 00:32:46,875
The chest wall hasn't developed
completely to cover the heart.

790
00:32:46,917 --> 00:32:48,583
She'll need surgery.

791
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:50,333
Oh, what do we do, Cooper?

792
00:32:50,375 --> 00:32:52,041
I just--i don't want
to lose these babies,

793
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:54,250
but I'm scared.
What do we do?

794
00:32:54,291 --> 00:32:55,917
Okay, look at me. Look at me.
Here's what's gonna happen--

Mason's the best thing

she might not make it,

871

Addison saying, "cognitive"

trying to keep

878

I need more time.
I'm just not...

881
00:37:00,667 --> 00:37:02,041

882

884
00:37:13,083 --> 00:37:16,041
Violet didn't get enough time

885
00:37:16,083 --> 00:37:18,250
My family needs me.

886
00:37:18,291 --> 00:37:19,625
Charlotte and Mason

887
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:21,625
and baby king-Freedman

888
00:37:21,667 --> 00:37:25,041
and the two heads of lettuce--
they all need me,

889
00:37:25,083 --> 00:37:28,000
because I'm the dad now.

890
00:37:28,041 --> 00:37:31,792
And so it's time to step up
and do my job,

891
00:37:31,834 --> 00:37:37,291
because being a dad is
the greatest gift in the world.

892
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:40,125
So...

893
00:37:40,166 --> 00:37:43,083

Hey. How's Charlotte?

895
00:37:45,542 --> 00:37:48,041
Good. Uh, she tolerated
the procedure well.

896
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:50,041
Contractions have stopped,
and she's sleeping.

897
00:37:50,083 --> 00:37:51,542
So are we out of the woods?
Not entirely.

898
00:37:51,583 --> 00:37:53,709
I had to put her into
trendelenburg.

899
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:56,333
It could prevent her
from going into labor again.

900
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:59,000
And how long does
she have to stay like that?
Probably until
she gives birth.

901
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:03,208
And in that position,

902
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:05,542
she's at risk for blood clots,
headaches?

903
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:07,291
Yeah.

904
00:38:07,333 --> 00:38:09,542
She's not gonna be able
to see her baby.

905
00:38:09,583 --> 00:38:12,083
Anyway, I'm sorry.

906
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:13,583
