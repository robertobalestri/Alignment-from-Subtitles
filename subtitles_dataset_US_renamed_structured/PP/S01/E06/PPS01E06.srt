Had a humerus fracture when
she was younger, from a fall.

- OK.
- Except, as I suspected,

170
00:10:00,735 --> 00:10:03,363
she actually had a spiral fracture
of her humerus.

171
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:06,964
Know how you get it ? Someone grabs
your arm and twists so hard it snaps.

172

- Someone hurt her on purpose.
- More fun facts.

- Maybe it's a kid at school.

- I talked to the school. It's not it.
- Not Marilyn.

- You're a genetic specialist, right ?
- Yes.

That it's better to know the truth.

00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:30,800

whether or not I'm dying.

00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:55,559
- Huntington's Disease ?
- It's a genetic disorder that causes...

A degeneration of the brain cells.

My grandmother had it.

And you think you might have it ?

230
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:21,689
If her mother had it, she has a
50-50 chance of inheriting the gene.

231
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:26,027
And if I have the gene, I have a 100%
chance of dying from the disease.

232

But you've never been tested ?

you could have Huntington's.

maybe I don't have the gene.

- Not everybody has that dream.

She acknowledges they exist

'cause they scream in her restaurants,
but that's it.

Look, not everybody is cut out for it.

279
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:04,984
It is incredibly hard for a woman
to admit that she doesn't want kids.

280
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:07,721
Because they're basically
admitting they're men ?

281
00:17:07,795 --> 00:17:10,457
OK, no. Just because
you've apparently moved in...

282

can be alone and be fulfilled. Very.

and I grabbed Tess' arm.

- It was an accident.
- Why didn't you just say that ?

298

Because. People like Dr. Freedman
get the wrong idea.

wrong idea ? You've had lots of injuries.

Don't piss Dell off.

317
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:31,803
He was weighing in on a case,
overstepping his bounds.

318

I need him to keep this place running.

319
00:19:33,941 --> 00:19:37,001
- That all you need him for ?
- What ? You heard I went on a date

320
00:19:37,077 --> 00:19:39,238
- and you take it out on Dell ?
- No.

321
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:42,179
- You got some kind of a thing going.
- There's no thing.

- Shush. It might be asleep.
- It ?

00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:12,372
You're enjoying this, aren't you ?
Seeing me tortured.

329
00:20:12,446 --> 00:20:14,710
It is satisfying.

330
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:20,608
Why did you come to my house
the other night ? Really ?

331
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:23,417
- I thought we could have fun.
- I'm not looking for fun.

332
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:27,153
Sam told me that you're
the marrying kind of woman.

333
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:29,593
- I am.
- I've been married.

334
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:32,597
I don't plan on ever going
down that road again, so...

335
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:36,363
If you want fun, I'm here.

336
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:40,202
- If you want more, I...
- I should look elsewhere.

337
00:20:40,274 --> 00:20:42,504
- Addison...
- [Charlotte] It's not working !

338
00:20:42,576 --> 00:20:43,804
I'm not sleeping !

339
00:20:45,646 --> 00:20:48,513
And still satisfying.

340
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:53,775
Go. Make it sleep.

341
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:09,264
Obviously you'll be expected
to testify, Dr. Freedman.

342
00:21:09,336 --> 00:21:12,100
- Now, tomorrow is the hearing.
- That's fast.

343
00:21:12,172 --> 00:21:14,197
We move fast. We have to.

344
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:17,038
If the judge decides
it's an unsafe home environment,

345
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,873
the girl will be in foster care.

346
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:21,039
- What about the mother ?
- What about her ?

347
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:24,413
If Tess gets taken away,
Marilyn shouldn't be alone. She has MS.

348
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:27,146
It's not our concern.
Our concern is the child.

349
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:31,156
I should say Tess is pretty insistent
that there's no abuse.

350
00:21:31,224 --> 00:21:35,160
Not unusual. The child protects
the parent, rationalizes the behavior.

351
00:21:35,228 --> 00:21:38,391
- If Tess is telling the truth ?
- That's why there's a judge.

352
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:40,762
The medical testimony carries weight,

353
00:21:40,834 --> 00:21:44,201
and I'm sure Dr. Freedman
did not make this call lightly.

354
00:21:49,576 --> 00:21:52,841
Angie, this is Dr. Violet Turner.

355
00:21:52,913 --> 00:21:55,074
- She's our psychiatrist.
- Hi.

356
00:21:56,183 --> 00:21:59,744
I thought you were just
going to tell me my test results.

357
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,148
Oh.

358
00:22:09,062 --> 00:22:11,223
Oh...

359
00:22:11,298 --> 00:22:15,166
I have it.
I really have it.

360
00:22:16,903 --> 00:22:19,929
But as of now, you have no symptoms.

361
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:23,170
You could go years before
you show any sign of illness.

362
00:22:23,276 --> 00:22:25,039
Illness ?

363
00:22:25,145 --> 00:22:29,013
You mean dementia ?
Violent rages ? Wetting myself ?

364
00:22:29,082 --> 00:22:33,382
A lot of the research they're doing with
repression proteins is very promising.

365
00:22:33,453 --> 00:22:37,014
- Hopefully, in time...
- No. I don't have time, Dr. Bennett.

366
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,955
Time is the one thing I don't have.

367
00:22:39,026 --> 00:22:42,359
I've got a great life,
an amazing husband, but no time.

368
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:44,397
Damn it. I am so out of time.

369
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:53,533
I know this is a lot to process,
but you're not alone.

370
00:22:53,607 --> 00:22:55,302
You have Ray.

371
00:22:55,375 --> 00:23:00,108
No. No. I knew what I was
getting into when I took that test.

372
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,671
- That stupid, stupid test !
- Angie.

373
00:23:02,749 --> 00:23:05,309
Why don't you stay ? We can talk.

374
00:23:05,419 --> 00:23:08,081
I can't. But thank you.

375
00:23:08,155 --> 00:23:10,919
All of you for trying to help.

376
00:23:10,991 --> 00:23:14,950
- But what about Ray ? What are you...
- Don't worry. I know what I have to do.

377
00:23:19,299 --> 00:23:21,267
- I'm begging you.
- Oh, no.

378
00:23:21,334 --> 00:23:26,101
I have tried acupuncture, massage,
pressure points, melatonin supplements,

379
00:23:26,173 --> 00:23:29,438
aromatherapy, sound therapy.
I can tell it's not working

380
00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:32,569
because she's still bitching at me !

381
00:23:32,646 --> 00:23:34,978
- Charlotte needs a shrink.
- Agreed.

382
00:23:35,048 --> 00:23:37,346
- In more ways than one...
- Squeeze her in.

383
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:39,385
- I...
- This is co-op medicine,

384
00:23:39,453 --> 00:23:43,412
and I am referring.
You need to co-op. Now.

385
00:23:48,295 --> 00:23:51,059
Ninety percent of sleep issues
are psychological.

386
00:23:51,131 --> 00:23:52,758
Fine. Shrink away.

387
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:56,599
When you sleep, do you toss and turn ?
Thrash around a lot ?

388
00:23:56,703 --> 00:23:59,866
- How would I know ? I'm asleep.
- Right. Yeah, I realize that.

389
00:23:59,973 --> 00:24:02,635
Well, that's where a partner
could be helpful.

390
00:24:02,709 --> 00:24:05,678
Uh... The last time you slept
with someone else...

391
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:07,940
Was years ago.

392
00:24:08,048 --> 00:24:10,983
- So you haven't had sex in...
- I have sex.

393
00:24:11,051 --> 00:24:13,178
- They just don't sleep over.
- Ever ?

394
00:24:13,253 --> 00:24:15,721
Are you asking because of my well-being,

395
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:18,917
or because you're thrilled
to find someone as alone as you ?

396
00:24:18,992 --> 00:24:21,153
Just because I don't want a child ?

397
00:24:21,228 --> 00:24:25,164
I'm fine.
I am better than fine, in fact.

398
00:24:25,232 --> 00:24:26,392
[Exhales]

399
00:24:29,236 --> 00:24:30,726
Let's just stay on you.

400
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:33,170
- [Elevator dings]
- Dr. Montgomery.

401
00:24:33,273 --> 00:24:36,765
- Hey. Ray, how are you ? How's Angie ?
- Gone.

402
00:24:36,843 --> 00:24:39,539
She's gone. Angie left me.

403
00:24:40,514 --> 00:24:45,178
I came home and I found her
packing a suitcase. And...

404
00:24:45,252 --> 00:24:48,983
She said that her appointment here
was like some kind of wake-up call.

405
00:24:49,723 --> 00:24:52,157
And then she just left.

406
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:54,424
And that's all she said ?

407
00:24:55,996 --> 00:24:58,260
- Ray, why don't you...
- I don't understand !

408
00:24:58,331 --> 00:25:01,994
She spends two minutes with you and
throws in the towel on our marriage ?

409
00:25:02,068 --> 00:25:05,526
- Ray, please, calm down.
- No, I want to know.

410
00:25:05,605 --> 00:25:08,472
What the hell did you say to my wife ?

411
00:25:12,712 --> 00:25:14,680
It smells like Christmas in here.

412
00:25:14,748 --> 00:25:18,184
It's an Ayurvedic sleep remedy
that might knock Charlotte out.

413
00:25:18,251 --> 00:25:20,617
- What did you get ?
- Intimacy issues.

414
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:24,646
Severe. She tries to alienate
anybody who might get close.

415
00:25:24,724 --> 00:25:26,351
Even people she asks for help.

416
00:25:26,426 --> 00:25:30,362
Sleep's triggered when you comfort
yourself into a self-sedated state.

417
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:34,161
People like Charlotte ? Chances are
nobody ever really nurtured her.

418
00:25:34,234 --> 00:25:36,794
Taught her how to self-soothe.

419
00:25:37,837 --> 00:25:40,704
Nurture her, Pete. Be kind.

420
00:25:42,409 --> 00:25:43,535
I...

421
00:25:44,144 --> 00:25:45,270
[sighs]

422
00:25:45,345 --> 00:25:49,805
- Do people have babies in this bed ?
- We change the sheets. Promise.

423
00:25:57,457 --> 00:26:00,017
Go ahead and close your eyes. Relax.

424
00:26:00,627 --> 00:26:02,527
You smile like an idiot.

425
00:26:02,596 --> 00:26:07,499
- I'm staying positive.
- [Sighs] Brother.

426
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:12,004
People need connection to stay healthy.
Positive connection with another human.

427
00:26:12,072 --> 00:26:16,441
I don't...
I don't need your pity positivity.

428
00:26:16,543 --> 00:26:20,604
I don't know what Violet told you,
but I connect. OK ?

429
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,204
Yeah ? When ?

430
00:26:22,282 --> 00:26:24,716
- None of your business.
- Business. Right.

431
00:26:24,784 --> 00:26:28,311
Maybe... I'm not the guy to help you.

432
00:26:28,388 --> 00:26:31,323
- Maybe you need someone...
- Who I can't irritate.

433
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,093
Find that man for me and I'll marry him.

434
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:42,929
[Exhales] My family
didn't believe in displays.

435
00:26:43,003 --> 00:26:44,937
Of affection ?

436
00:26:46,006 --> 00:26:47,132
[Exhales]

437
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:49,971
My mother...

438
00:26:50,043 --> 00:26:54,139
There was the occasional sloppy kind
that followed cocktails.

439
00:26:54,214 --> 00:26:55,875
And since then ?

440
00:26:58,885 --> 00:27:01,046
Who has time for that kind of thing ?

441
00:27:02,756 --> 00:27:05,190
I'm sorry, Charlotte.

442
00:27:09,462 --> 00:27:11,430
Do you want to try again ?

443
00:27:12,132 --> 00:27:14,032
Why not.

444
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,261
My hair's already shot.

445
00:27:23,043 --> 00:27:26,137
Can you drop this
at the lab for me ? Thanks.

446
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:30,282
Um... Marilyn Sullivan
called again.

447
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:32,978
Not allowed to speak to her
until after the hearing.

448
00:27:33,053 --> 00:27:36,989
Don't start, man. There's nothing vague
about the law. I suspect and...

449
00:27:37,057 --> 00:27:41,357
- Tess wears long sleeves a lot.
- What ?

450
00:27:41,428 --> 00:27:45,194
Even when it's, like, 95 degrees
outside. Down over her hands.

451
00:27:45,265 --> 00:27:48,291
- She ever look at you in the eye ?
- Not really. No.

452
00:27:48,368 --> 00:27:52,031
When she has appointments without
her mom, she's early, hangs out after

453
00:27:52,105 --> 00:27:55,006
- like she doesn't want to go home.
- Yeah, I've seen that.

454
00:27:55,075 --> 00:27:56,702
How do you know all this ?

455
00:27:56,776 --> 00:28:00,735
Uh, because I did the same thing
when I was in her situation.

456
00:28:02,315 --> 00:28:06,183
That's what you do.
I'll get the lab right on this.

457
00:28:13,126 --> 00:28:17,062
Fascinating. She's been here all night ?

458
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:21,499
- She snores.
- Asleep, she looks almost harmless.

459
00:28:21,568 --> 00:28:24,298
Mmm. Like a sleeping tiger.

460
00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:27,704
Shh. Don't wake the tiger.

461
00:28:27,774 --> 00:28:31,335
I have to go, um,
I gotta put my tie on for Tess' hearing.

462
00:28:35,448 --> 00:28:37,006
He needs you.

463
00:28:44,524 --> 00:28:47,288
He put her to sleep.
He actually did it.

464
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,191
Yeah.

465
00:28:49,262 --> 00:28:52,891
Angie's here. She finally
responded to our phone messages.

466
00:28:52,966 --> 00:28:55,526
Well, we got her to come back.
That's something.

467
00:28:55,635 --> 00:28:59,196
- Any ideas on what we say to her ?
- No.

468
00:28:59,272 --> 00:29:02,730
You said the baby making game
would be fun. I am not having fun.

469
00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:06,176
Oh, God. Me neither. Not with this one.

470
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:08,042
It's not fair.

471
00:29:09,816 --> 00:29:13,149
Good people should
get to have what they want.

472
00:29:13,219 --> 00:29:17,519
I was heading to the airport.
You said there was something with Ray ?

473
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,956
Ray came by to see us yesterday.

474
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:23,620
He was worried sick about you.
Not to mention confused and hurt.

475
00:29:23,696 --> 00:29:26,062
You didn't tell him, did you ?
You cannot tell him.

476
00:29:26,166 --> 00:29:29,624
Angie, he is your husband.
He deserves to know the truth.

477
00:29:29,702 --> 00:29:33,798
[Sighs] Let him think I left him.

478
00:29:33,873 --> 00:29:39,311
Let him hate me. Then he can move on,
find someone, be happy.

479
00:29:39,379 --> 00:29:41,142
He's happy with you.

480
00:29:41,214 --> 00:29:44,377
[Angie] But he's gonna...

481
00:29:44,484 --> 00:29:47,817
I'm going to get so sick.

482
00:29:47,887 --> 00:29:49,787
I'm going to die.

483
00:29:49,856 --> 00:29:52,416
- I don't want to die.
- Angie.

484
00:29:54,394 --> 00:29:57,659
You have a disease. And you will die.

485
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:59,163
That's the truth.

486
00:29:59,232 --> 00:30:03,328
Hiding it from Ray
is not going to change that.

487
00:30:03,403 --> 00:30:09,103
But the bigger truth, the better truth,
is that you are alive now.

488
00:30:09,843 --> 00:30:13,176
You're living. And you should get...

489
00:30:13,246 --> 00:30:17,808
You should get everything
that life has to offer.

490
00:30:19,986 --> 00:30:22,147
You should get what you want.

491
00:30:22,222 --> 00:30:27,319
You should get to have a child
and a family and Ray.

492
00:30:27,393 --> 00:30:31,921
Just because you're sick, doesn't
mean you don't get to live your life.

493
00:30:32,765 --> 00:30:34,255
Go home.

494
00:30:34,334 --> 00:30:39,271
Tell Ray the truth. Tell him
what the future is and let him decide.

495
00:30:40,406 --> 00:30:43,136
A person...

496
00:30:43,209 --> 00:30:45,336
...should get to have a whole life.

497
00:30:52,886 --> 00:30:56,652
Didn't Allan wear yellow ties ? Did you
bring me one of Allan's old ties ?

498
00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:00,550
I bought this tie for you.

499
00:31:00,627 --> 00:31:02,993
Today you become a man.

500
00:31:04,564 --> 00:31:06,259
Yeah.

501
00:31:17,844 --> 00:31:19,744
What are you going to say ?

502
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:23,811
- You shouldn't really be...
- What are you going to say ?

503
00:31:23,883 --> 00:31:26,784
I'll tell you
if you roll up your sleeves.

504
00:31:31,024 --> 00:31:33,322
So whatever.

505
00:31:33,393 --> 00:31:35,418
She hits me a little.

506
00:31:35,495 --> 00:31:37,019
But she's sorry.

507
00:31:37,096 --> 00:31:41,260
Afterward, I mean. She's really sorry.

508
00:31:41,334 --> 00:31:44,201
It's not like I couldn't hit her back,
look at her.

509
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:46,534
- Oh, Tess.
- But I don't need to hit her.

510
00:31:46,606 --> 00:31:48,972
She needs to hit someone.
Her life sucks !

511
00:31:49,075 --> 00:31:51,043
Tess, everyone has pain.

512
00:31:51,144 --> 00:31:54,079
So why can't this just be mine ?

513
00:32:04,357 --> 00:32:05,881
Um...

514
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,927
- What time is it ?
- It's about 12 :15.

515
00:32:09,996 --> 00:32:11,554
- Tomorrow ?
- Today.

516
00:32:11,664 --> 00:32:14,360
Well, yes, today is your tomorrow.

517
00:32:14,434 --> 00:32:16,197
Oh, my God.

518
00:32:18,538 --> 00:32:21,063
Oh, my God. This is... Oh, God !

519
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,573
Lt'll wash out.

520
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:25,272
I mixed you a tonic to take home.

521
00:32:25,378 --> 00:32:27,846
It should help you
fall asleep easily tonight.

522
00:32:27,914 --> 00:32:30,610
- I don't need your potions.
- Really ?

523
00:32:30,683 --> 00:32:35,245
- It kind of seemed like you did.
- Don't throw yourself a party.

524
00:32:35,355 --> 00:32:39,052
You don't have me figured out.
I said some things when I was loopy.

525
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:43,255
I probably just hit a wall.
I hit a wall and it happened to be here.

526
00:32:44,097 --> 00:32:45,724
OK.

527
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:54,004
Dr. Freedman, would you
explain to the court

528
00:32:54,107 --> 00:32:57,406
the injuries you've noticed on Tess
over the last year.

529
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:03,048
Sorry. Sorry.

530
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:05,413
Sorry. Thanks.

531
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:10,148
Over the last year...
Two lacerations, multiple contusions

532
00:33:10,223 --> 00:33:14,091
and abrasions,
plus the recent wrist fracture.

533
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:18,529
And, in your opinion, is there any way
that the injury could have occurred

534
00:33:18,631 --> 00:33:21,930
other than by the intentional twisting
of the child's arm ?

535
00:33:22,001 --> 00:33:24,970
[ ? Tom McRae : <i>Lord, How Long ?]</i>

536
00:33:30,877 --> 00:33:34,643
- No. There's not.
- Thank you very much, Dr. Freedman.

537
00:33:40,586 --> 00:33:43,487
Can I...
Can I just say one more thing ?

538
00:33:44,257 --> 00:33:46,817
- Sure.
- OK, um...

539
00:33:46,926 --> 00:33:50,020
[clears throat] I've known Tess

540
00:33:50,096 --> 00:33:54,396
for a little while now,
and she is a great kid. So tough.

541
00:33:54,467 --> 00:33:57,903
She doesn't let anybody see her cry.
I don't know if she does cry.

542
00:33:59,772 --> 00:34:03,003
But it doesn't matter how strong she is.

543
00:34:03,076 --> 00:34:06,375
Some things,
a kid should never have to take.

544
00:34:06,446 --> 00:34:07,970
Being hurt,

545
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:12,575
being hit by someone
who's supposed to love and protect you.

546
00:34:12,652 --> 00:34:15,712
You don't have to take that, Tess.
You can't take it.

547
00:34:17,156 --> 00:34:22,389
Because once you let yourself shut down
like that, you're not a kid anymore.

548
00:34:25,732 --> 00:34:28,565
Uh, I'm... OK. I'm done talking.

549
00:34:28,634 --> 00:34:31,603
You can return to the gallery.
Thank you, Dr. Freedman.

550
00:34:39,312 --> 00:34:43,180
- They're taking her away from me.
- I can't. Not now, Marilyn.

551
00:34:43,249 --> 00:34:46,082
It's not right ! I'm her mother !
I'm her mother !

552
00:34:46,152 --> 00:34:48,643
- Sam !
- Right. You're her mother.

553
00:34:50,823 --> 00:34:52,586
Don't tell me you believe them.

554
00:34:54,761 --> 00:34:57,525
I'm not evil. I made a mistake !

555
00:34:59,766 --> 00:35:01,734
I love my daughter.

556
00:35:22,421 --> 00:35:24,116
That kid...

557
00:35:26,259 --> 00:35:28,420
All she wants is her mom.

558
00:35:33,032 --> 00:35:35,000
I didn't want to see it.

559
00:35:37,403 --> 00:35:39,337
And I should have.

560
00:35:41,974 --> 00:35:43,601
I should have.

561
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:57,278
- Excuse me ?
- We don't have an appointment, but...

562
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:59,653
Please. Come in.

563
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:06,963
So, uh, the fertility tests,

564
00:36:07,033 --> 00:36:11,265
they came back fine for both of us,
so we can make a baby ?

565
00:36:11,337 --> 00:36:15,501
We want to share
what life I have left with a child.

566
00:36:15,575 --> 00:36:19,944
And we were wondering if
there was something you could do

567
00:36:20,046 --> 00:36:22,674
to make me pregnant
sooner rather than later.

568
00:36:22,748 --> 00:36:24,841
Because Angie doesn't have
a lot of time.

569
00:36:24,917 --> 00:36:28,284
I just want to make sure
that you understand...

570
00:36:28,354 --> 00:36:30,447
I understand.

571
00:36:31,023 --> 00:36:35,687
Angie will die sooner than we want.

572
00:36:36,329 --> 00:36:37,887
Angie will...

573
00:36:40,633 --> 00:36:46,594
But that's the future, and I don't care
what happens tomorrow or in a few years.

574
00:36:46,672 --> 00:36:49,368
We have this now. We have us now.

575
00:36:49,442 --> 00:36:53,208
There is still the risk
that the child will have the gene.

576
00:36:53,312 --> 00:36:55,007
We know.

577
00:36:55,081 --> 00:36:57,208
We're willing to take that chance.

578
00:36:57,283 --> 00:37:01,982
If everyone who had the gene was never
born, I never would have met Angie.

579
00:37:03,956 --> 00:37:06,117
- But I really...
- [Addison] Naomi.

580
00:37:06,225 --> 00:37:09,592
They want us to help them make a baby.

581
00:37:09,662 --> 00:37:12,187
A person gets to have her whole life.

582
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:15,565
A person gets to have her whole life.

583
00:37:31,617 --> 00:37:34,108
So you're a convert now ?

584
00:37:34,954 --> 00:37:37,320
Just covering my bases.

585
00:37:37,857 --> 00:37:41,020
Well, I am sure Pete
appreciates your gratitude.

586
00:37:41,127 --> 00:37:44,756
Pete doesn't need it. He congratulates
himself enough for all of us.

587
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,127
Ha.

588
00:37:46,198 --> 00:37:49,725
But, damn, the man
has good hands, doesn't he ?

589
00:37:55,308 --> 00:37:59,540
[ ? Matt Nathanson : <i>All We Are]</i>

590
00:38:01,681 --> 00:38:07,119
What would you be doing right now
if you were Angie ?

591
00:38:08,688 --> 00:38:10,849
You mean, if I knew...

592
00:38:10,923 --> 00:38:14,188
Knew how limited your time was.
If you knew.

593
00:38:18,364 --> 00:38:20,594
Pretty much what I'm doing right now.

594
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,361
Check you out, all Zen.

595
00:38:23,436 --> 00:38:26,200
Also known as margarita number two.

596
00:38:29,742 --> 00:38:35,009
I'd be on a plane to
somewhere spectacular with Maya.

597
00:38:36,816 --> 00:38:38,545
What about you ?

598
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:41,744
I...

599
00:38:43,889 --> 00:38:45,447
I don't know.

600
00:38:45,558 --> 00:38:50,257
I'm going for more serenity. Baby girl.

601
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:51,887
Thank you.

602
00:39:01,707 --> 00:39:03,140
Liar.

603
00:39:19,992 --> 00:39:22,552
- Where's your power tie ?
- Oh, I took it off.

604
00:39:22,628 --> 00:39:26,120
I didn't want to throw up on it.
I plan on throwing up tonight.

605
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:31,498
Cooper, because of you,

606
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:35,836
Tess knows that an adult saw her
and cared enough to protect her.

607
00:39:35,908 --> 00:39:38,809
How many times have
we met Marilyn Sullivan ?

608
00:39:38,878 --> 00:39:40,311
Did you ever think that...

609
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:43,542
That's why people who shouldn't
have children, shouldn't.

610
00:39:43,649 --> 00:39:47,983
And you count yourself among those
people. You're crazy. You would never...

611
00:39:48,054 --> 00:39:51,888
Well, who knows ? I don't think anybody
who had a child ever thought,

612
00:39:51,957 --> 00:39:54,517
"Oh, boy, now I have
something I can hit."

613
00:39:55,728 --> 00:40:00,688
Violet, you are the most caring,
generous person I know.

614
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,428
And the most neurotic,
the most self-involved...

615
00:40:03,502 --> 00:40:05,936
You're telling me
that if you met the right man

616
00:40:06,005 --> 00:40:10,635
and fell in love and he wanted to,
you wouldn't even consider it ?

617
00:40:12,745 --> 00:40:13,905
Oh...

618
00:40:13,979 --> 00:40:16,345
You would. You would.

619
00:40:18,651 --> 00:40:20,312
Hey.

620
00:40:20,953 --> 00:40:22,318
Um...

621
00:40:22,388 --> 00:40:26,119
Sam told me about
how you helped with Tess.

622
00:40:26,192 --> 00:40:28,558
If you ever want to talk
or need some help...

623
00:40:28,661 --> 00:40:30,356
I'm OK.

624
00:40:32,698 --> 00:40:35,758
You do a lot for the practice.

625
00:40:37,103 --> 00:40:39,071
You are the practice.

626
00:40:39,171 --> 00:40:42,868
You keep it running, the way you deal
with patients, the way you care.

627
00:40:42,942 --> 00:40:45,570
Your dream was what
started it in the first place.

628
00:40:45,644 --> 00:40:47,111
And Sam's.

629
00:40:47,179 --> 00:40:49,443
- And Sam's.
- Yeah.

630
00:40:51,584 --> 00:40:53,449
But I do it for you.

631
00:41:08,033 --> 00:41:12,367
Charlotte King says
you have good hands.

632
00:41:18,978 --> 00:41:20,673
What ?

633
00:41:31,824 --> 00:41:33,587
Oh. Uh...

634
00:41:33,692 --> 00:41:35,159
I...

635
00:41:35,227 --> 00:41:36,888
Well, OK.

636
00:41:36,962 --> 00:41:39,328
- It's OK. I was just...
- No, no, no.

637
00:41:39,431 --> 00:41:41,922
- Just, um...
- Having some fun ?

638
00:41:43,369 --> 00:41:44,336
No.

639
00:41:46,172 --> 00:41:47,935
I don't want fun.

640
00:41:48,007 --> 00:41:51,340
- A person should get what she wants.
- What does that mean ?

641
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:53,378
- Good night, Pete.
- What does that mean ?

642
00:41:53,479 --> 00:41:56,607
- You can't just kiss a person, and...
- Good night, Pete.

643
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:13,189
You're in it now, man.
