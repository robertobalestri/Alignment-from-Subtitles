What do you say
we just see how it goes ? Tonight.

He stood me up.

00:00:06,641 --> 00:00:09,075
You and me.
Friends with benefits. Tonight.

5
00:00:09,144 --> 00:00:10,406
What time should I come over ?

6
00:00:10,478 --> 00:00:14,005
You're not some random girl. With you
it doesn't mean nothing. It never will.

7
00:00:14,082 --> 00:00:15,709
All right. Get out.

8
00:00:15,784 --> 00:00:19,652
I am so sick and tired of being the only
person in this practice who thinks !

- No. Not yet, but, um... OK.

Hi. Good morning.

- Hi. Here you go.
- Naomi ?

15
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,018
Yeah. She just went...

16
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:53,417
- Is Naomi...
- What's up with everybody ?

17
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:56,150
Was there a car accident
or something ? What ?

18
00:00:59,995 --> 00:01:01,724
Or something.

19
00:01:03,465 --> 00:01:05,433
- Milk ?
- Oh, thanks.

20
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,802
- They're behind closed doors.
- Who ?

21
00:01:11,573 --> 00:01:13,336
The women.

22
00:01:15,276 --> 00:01:18,939
If they're going to talk about us,
we should talk about them.

23
00:01:19,014 --> 00:01:22,472
Yeah. Let's talk.

24
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,915
Let's talk smack.

25
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:29,918
- I need ten minutes with Naomi.
- I need Naomi first.

26
00:01:29,991 --> 00:01:31,549
- Naomi ?
- Nai ?

27
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:35,323
She slept with Cooper. She slept with
Pete. The cats out of bag, all that.

28
00:01:35,397 --> 00:01:38,127
- Didn't sleep with Pete.
- Didn't sleep with Cooper.

29
00:01:38,199 --> 00:01:39,564
[Both] How did you know that ?

30
00:01:39,668 --> 00:01:41,829
- There're no secrets around here.
- I know.

31
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:44,200
Oh, there are secrets.

32
00:01:44,272 --> 00:01:46,968
I mean, I didn't know.
Wow. Neither one of you ? Really ?

33
00:01:47,042 --> 00:01:48,009
I didn't know.

34
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:50,976
- That's all I'm saying.
- Pete literally stood me up.

35
00:01:51,046 --> 00:01:53,606
I don't get stood up. I'm Addison.

36
00:01:53,682 --> 00:01:56,014
Which means something...

37
00:01:56,084 --> 00:02:00,350
...in places where things
mean things. It was humiliating.

38
00:02:00,422 --> 00:02:02,322
Were you completely naked ?

39
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,018
Did you stand in front of him
like a peeled banana

40
00:02:05,093 --> 00:02:07,391
while he looked over your best parts ?

41
00:02:07,462 --> 00:02:11,626
Because I have good parts and Cooper
passed on them. I have good parts.

42
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,396
- Damn right, you do. And so do I.
- I like your breasts.

43
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:17,029
- You have a good ass.
- Thank you. I like it.

44
00:02:17,105 --> 00:02:22,338
Hey ! Hey, hey, hey. The point is, we
should not be having sex in the office.

45
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,901
Who's having sex in the office ?

46
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:27,743
No one. No one. That's the point.

47
00:02:27,816 --> 00:02:31,377
It gets complicated. You just...
You don't know where you stand.

48
00:02:31,486 --> 00:02:34,455
What do you think
they're saying about us ?

49
00:02:34,522 --> 00:02:37,958
- You know what ? Who cares ?
- Yeah. Who cares ?

50
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:49,765
The guys are still in the kitchen.

51
00:02:49,838 --> 00:02:51,738
How am I going to get coffee ?
I need it.

52
00:02:51,806 --> 00:02:55,071
- Can we skip the morning meeting ?
- No morning meeting today.

53
00:02:55,143 --> 00:02:57,236
- Thank you.
- Charlotte King is coming by

54
00:02:57,312 --> 00:03:00,406
to walk all of us through
the Safe Surrender program.

55
00:03:01,216 --> 00:03:03,377
- That's today.
- Yeah.

56
00:03:03,485 --> 00:03:06,010
I signed up with Pete.

57
00:03:06,087 --> 00:03:08,419
I am in control.

58
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,048
I work here.

59
00:03:11,426 --> 00:03:13,792
I'm moving on.

60
00:03:13,862 --> 00:03:16,296
But I'm getting my coffee
from downstairs.

61
00:03:16,364 --> 00:03:19,333
- Oh. Small non-fat chai latte.
- Frappuccino. Extra whip.

62
00:03:26,508 --> 00:03:28,669
- Blame the guy in front.
- Sorry ?

63
00:03:28,777 --> 00:03:31,473
The guy at the front
just ordered a coffee with, like,

64
00:03:31,546 --> 00:03:35,312
seven descriptive words in front of it.
Blame him if you're running late.

65
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:36,940
Oh, I work upstairs.

66
00:03:37,018 --> 00:03:40,579
I just have a meeting to get to.
Not a big deal.

67
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:42,849
Well, you can go in front of me.

68
00:03:42,957 --> 00:03:46,825
You look important. I'm guessing
this meeting won't go on without you.

69
00:03:48,163 --> 00:03:50,131
Thank you.

70
00:03:50,832 --> 00:03:53,062
- I'm Carl, by the way.
- Addison.

71
00:03:53,134 --> 00:03:55,159
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,199
[Elevator dings]

73
00:04:07,582 --> 00:04:09,675
- Hey. I...
- Stop me now if you had amnesia

74
00:04:09,751 --> 00:04:12,311
or you were bleeding to death in an ER.

75
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,786
- Addison, I...
- No ? Good. Here's the deal.

76
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:18,416
I take full responsibility for last
night. I was warned repeatedly.

77
00:04:18,493 --> 00:04:22,156
By you, and I should know by now that
when someone tells you who they are,

78
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,061
you should believe them.

79
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,293
I can work with you, but personally,

80
00:04:27,368 --> 00:04:30,735
you've been downgraded
to acquaintance, I'm moving on.

81
00:04:32,073 --> 00:04:34,041
Fair enough.

82
00:04:34,442 --> 00:04:36,171
- We have coffee here.
- Shut up.

83
00:04:36,244 --> 00:04:38,144
What is wrong with everybody ?

84
00:04:38,646 --> 00:04:40,511
OK, Safe Surrender rundown.

85
00:04:40,582 --> 00:04:43,483
Montgomery, you and Pete
are the go-to team.

86
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:47,883
Am I wrong ? That's what I have here.

87
00:04:47,956 --> 00:04:49,617
No, we volunteered last week.

88
00:04:49,691 --> 00:04:51,659
Good times. Happier times.

89
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,659
The cell phone. That's all they need ?

90
00:04:53,728 --> 00:04:57,687
Well, the next 48 hours, all calls
placed to the Safe Surrender hotline

91
00:04:57,799 --> 00:04:59,528
will be rerouted to that phone.

92
00:04:59,601 --> 00:05:02,866
Don't stray far from here
or from each other.

93
00:05:02,937 --> 00:05:04,427
- Fine.
- Calls are from women

94
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:07,804
- who want to give up their babies ?
- Most have given birth already

95
00:05:07,876 --> 00:05:10,003
and can't or don't want
to keep the babies.

96
00:05:10,078 --> 00:05:12,706
They call from school bathrooms,
friend's places.

97
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:16,011
Too scared to go to hospitals,
where they have to provide names.

98
00:05:16,084 --> 00:05:19,576
So we arrange for a place to meet,
they surrender the baby, then what ?

99
00:05:19,654 --> 00:05:22,555
Bring them back here.
Dr. Freedman can do the exams.

100
00:05:22,624 --> 00:05:25,525
- If the babies are healthy ?
- Then call social services.

101
00:05:25,593 --> 00:05:28,357
And most important :
Don't forget the bracelets.

102
00:05:28,429 --> 00:05:31,262
One to the mom,
one on the baby's wrist or ankle.

103
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:35,029
If birth mother changes her mind,
she has two weeks to reclaim the child.

104
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:38,561
The victory is when that baby
is placed with someone who wants them.

105
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,007
If it's the mom, all the better.
That's all I have time for.

106
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:44,044
Any questions, call me.

107
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:52,847
Nothing Charlotte likes better than
bossing people around, huh ? Glowing.

108
00:05:52,954 --> 00:05:55,718
Safe Surrender saves hundreds
of babies a year.

109
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,917
It's an amazing thing that she's doing.

110
00:06:02,964 --> 00:06:05,899
How did you feel about the homework
I gave you last week ?

111
00:06:05,967 --> 00:06:09,733
Well, I didn't think I was an "imagine
yourself on a warm beach" kind of guy.

112
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:12,931
- But ?
- Every time I started to feel anxious,

113
00:06:13,007 --> 00:06:15,441
I thought about the Mediterranean,
it worked.

114
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,741
Well, maybe you're ready
for some more homework.

115
00:06:18,813 --> 00:06:21,111
- Bring it on.
- Let's identify something

116
00:06:21,182 --> 00:06:26,620
that would have triggered you in the
past. Something you'd like to try again.

117
00:06:26,688 --> 00:06:30,351
Done. I met a woman today.

118
00:06:30,425 --> 00:06:33,588
We exchanged business cards.

119
00:06:33,661 --> 00:06:36,425
I think I'm ready to try dating again.

120
00:06:43,938 --> 00:06:46,406
- Hey.
- Hey. Hey.

121
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:52,573
- We didn't forget how. [chuckles]
- [Chuckles]

122
00:06:52,647 --> 00:06:54,342
I tell you that.

123
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:56,576
No, we did not.

124
00:06:56,651 --> 00:06:59,017
I think we...

125
00:06:59,087 --> 00:07:01,988
- Yeah, we didn't forget.
- Nah.

126
00:07:02,056 --> 00:07:03,182
Uh...

127
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,525
So...

128
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:08,027
Uh...

129
00:07:11,032 --> 00:07:12,795
...what do you think ?

130
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,368
- What do I think ?
- Yeah. I just...

131
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:18,132
...you know, you laid it on me.

132
00:07:18,206 --> 00:07:21,664
So that gives you the right
to speak first.

133
00:07:21,743 --> 00:07:23,506
- I laid it on you ?
- No. Well...

134
00:07:23,578 --> 00:07:26,706
Because I jumped you
and you were helpless to stop me or...

135
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:28,612
I didn't say that.

136
00:07:28,683 --> 00:07:30,981
I just... was this a slip-up ?

137
00:07:31,052 --> 00:07:33,282
Like, a one-time thing ?

138
00:07:33,354 --> 00:07:37,415
Or would you want more here ?

139
00:07:40,028 --> 00:07:44,556
I don't know, Sam. I don't know.
For once, I hadn't thought it through.

140
00:07:44,632 --> 00:07:46,497
- Well...
- You know, the practice,

141
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:48,933
we barely got through it
after the split.

142
00:07:49,037 --> 00:07:51,062
- I know.
- And Maya.

143
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:54,506
I mean, it's not...
not fair to Maya.

144
00:07:56,177 --> 00:07:58,338
We got divorced for a reason.

145
00:08:01,983 --> 00:08:04,451
So, um...

146
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:06,487
...I think it was just a slip-up.

147
00:08:06,554 --> 00:08:08,112
Yeah.

148
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:12,355
- I, uh, I thought that too.
- OK, good.

149
00:08:12,427 --> 00:08:14,861
- Yeah.
- Good. OK.

150
00:08:14,929 --> 00:08:15,896
OK.

151
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:23,034
Hey, there was a message
on your voice mail. Your priest called ?

152
00:08:23,104 --> 00:08:25,572
You have a priest ?

153
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,938
Had. We used to.

154
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:29,874
OK. Yeah, well, he wants to see you.

155
00:08:29,944 --> 00:08:32,310
- Me ?
- Both of you. Together.

156
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,746
As soon as possible.
It sounded serious.

157
00:08:34,816 --> 00:08:36,977
What did you do, commit a mortal sin ?

158
00:08:37,418 --> 00:08:39,545
- [Scoffs]
- [Chuckles]

159
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:44,085
[Church bells tolling]

160
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:47,127
- God's trying to tell us something.
- It's a coincidence.

161
00:08:47,195 --> 00:08:51,325
No. We have sex and then the day after,
our priest summons us ?

162
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:54,232
It's the fires of hell, Sam.
We had sex.

163
00:08:54,302 --> 00:08:57,931
Just don't mention we got a divorce.
I don't need a lecture.

164
00:08:58,005 --> 00:08:59,870
- Play it cool.
- Yeah, yeah. Cool.

165
00:08:59,941 --> 00:09:01,966
- Thank you so much for coming.
- Hey.

166
00:09:02,043 --> 00:09:04,568
- We had sex and we're divorced.
- Oh...

167
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:07,113
- Naomi.
- I'm sorry. He's our priest.

168
00:09:07,181 --> 00:09:10,810
- I can't lie to him.
- I'm going to let that go for now,

169
00:09:10,885 --> 00:09:13,251
I'm also going to overlook
you two have been

170
00:09:13,354 --> 00:09:16,255
Christmas and Easter-ing it
for the last ten years.

171
00:09:16,324 --> 00:09:18,224
I called about one of the nuns.

172
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:20,226
It's Sister Helen. She's sick.

173
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:23,661
Well, we don't know what it is.
She's 86. She hates hospitals.

174
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:25,255
I thought of you two.

175
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:29,497
Sam, this is your area. Naomi, having
a woman would make her comfortable.

176
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,094
Has she been ill for a while ?

177
00:09:31,172 --> 00:09:35,438
Sister Amy would know. The sisters have
been sequestered alone together.

178
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,444
- Sequestered ?
- For three weeks.

179
00:09:37,512 --> 00:09:41,972
St. Mary's is our motherhouse. We spend
the year on missions around the world,

180
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:44,916
so this is the one time of year
we get to see each other.

181
00:09:44,986 --> 00:09:48,683
This is the first I've been outside
these walls in the last three weeks.

182
00:09:48,756 --> 00:09:51,520
- All right. So, please.
- OK.

183
00:09:55,396 --> 00:09:57,557
- Father Mark ?
- I'm not supposed to enter.

184
00:09:57,665 --> 00:10:00,634
No one from outside the sisterhood.
But they need you.

185
00:10:00,735 --> 00:10:03,568
- You're good Catholics, doctors.
- Doctors, at least.

186
00:10:03,638 --> 00:10:05,765
Go on. I'll wait for you here.

187
00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:12,739
[Grunts]

188
00:10:12,847 --> 00:10:16,544
It's all right, Sister Helen.
She's a doctor. It's all right.

189
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:18,312
When did she start feeling bad ?

190
00:10:18,386 --> 00:10:21,753
A week or so ago she said she felt
like she was getting the flu.

191
00:10:21,856 --> 00:10:25,519
She's the one who doesn't complain
of aches and pains. So we noticed.

192
00:10:28,563 --> 00:10:30,121
Sam.

193
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:34,391
What's this ?

194
00:10:36,871 --> 00:10:39,635
[Exhales] It's definitely not the flu.

195
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:55,383
- Still don't want to talk, Cooper.
- But I want to talk.

196
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:58,458
Well, there's a world wide web
out there waiting for you.

197
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:00,720
You can find someone who will listen.

198
00:11:00,795 --> 00:11:04,253
I can just grab the peanut butter and...

199
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:09,629
Men. They're overrated.

200
00:11:09,704 --> 00:11:12,673
Dating is overrated. Sex, is...

201
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,298
Don't.

202
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,809
Don't say something
you're going to regret.

203
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:18,708
[Phone ringing]

204
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,144
Um...

205
00:11:20,248 --> 00:11:23,012
Hello. Addison Montgomery.

206
00:11:23,084 --> 00:11:25,917
Carl. Hi.

207
00:11:25,987 --> 00:11:28,547
Yes, I would love to have coffee.

208
00:11:28,656 --> 00:11:32,888
But I am on call for work today, so...

209
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,088
Are you sure ? OK.

210
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:39,530
Then, yes. I will see you later.

211
00:11:39,634 --> 00:11:41,067
Bye.

212
00:11:42,737 --> 00:11:44,864
- I have a date tonight.
- You don't...

213
00:11:44,939 --> 00:11:47,305
You don't want
to move too fast, Addison.

214
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:51,277
- Not with a guy you barely know.
- Unhand me, woman.

215
00:11:51,979 --> 00:11:53,844
I'm getting my date on.

216
00:11:56,217 --> 00:11:59,482
It would help if we could
precisely identify the rash.

217
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:02,317
- I don't have my derm atlas on me.
- Wait.

218
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,759
- Sister Virginia ? Could you...
- Oh, yes, of course.

219
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:07,088
Thank you.

220
00:12:08,296 --> 00:12:11,197
- Sister.
- OK. There we go.

221
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:17,226
I'm going to send it to Dell. See if
he can't find someone to identify it.

222
00:12:17,305 --> 00:12:18,272
OK.

223
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:22,000
- How she feeling ?
- We may need to get her to a hospital.

224
00:12:22,076 --> 00:12:24,340
We'll do everything we can
to keep her here,

225
00:12:24,412 --> 00:12:28,314
but we can't treat her until we know
what kind of an infection she has.

226
00:12:28,382 --> 00:12:32,341
We also need to check the other sisters
to see if it's contagious.

227
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:34,914
You ever seen a rash like this ?

228
00:12:34,989 --> 00:12:36,422
Can't say that I have.

229
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:40,324
I'm tracking down an infectious disease
specialist to get an answer.

230
00:12:40,394 --> 00:12:43,625
Um, I'm done with patients for the day
but I'll be back later.

231
00:12:43,698 --> 00:12:46,462
Ring me if we get a call.
I'll be down the street.

232
00:12:46,534 --> 00:12:48,900
- I've got a thing.
- A "thing" ?

233
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:50,596
- Yes.
- Well, don't drink.

234
00:12:50,671 --> 00:12:53,231
Friends don't let friends
drink and save babies.

235
00:12:56,844 --> 00:12:59,404
- I think Addison has a date tonight.
- Good for her.

236
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,812
She's getting back on the horse.

237
00:13:03,084 --> 00:13:05,450
- I'm about to have a date tonight.
- Really ?

238
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,352
Yeah. With CanUHandleMe441.

239
00:13:08,422 --> 00:13:11,084
- Oh.
- What ? I don't believe in dwelling.

240
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:13,888
I believe in getting back on the horse.

241
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:16,521
- Well, I'll leave you to it.
- He's a lucky guy.

242
00:13:16,597 --> 00:13:18,724
- Who is ?
- Addison's horse.

243
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:22,633
[Woman coughing]

244
00:13:22,703 --> 00:13:26,036
- You feel a little clammy.
- I'm fine.

245
00:13:26,107 --> 00:13:29,270
I spend most of the year
ministering to people in Uganda.

246
00:13:29,377 --> 00:13:32,403
You ought to see
what I'm exposed to there.

247
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,847
- I'll weather Sister Helen's cold.
- Sister Virginia, please.

248
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:42,419
Sister Helen's temperature is a 103.
Her resps 26.

249
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,515
And Sister Virginia's getting sick.

250
00:13:44,592 --> 00:13:47,652
And Dell still hasn't come up
with anything on that rash.

251
00:13:48,462 --> 00:13:51,431
All right. We should just get
Sister Helen to a hospital.

252
00:13:51,499 --> 00:13:55,663
- I'll call the ambulance.
- Already did. They're 20 minutes out.

253
00:13:55,736 --> 00:13:58,967
- We make a good team.
- Yeah, we do.

254
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:03,839
And then I moved to L.A.

255
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:06,436
- And lived happily ever after ?
- Yes.

256
00:14:06,514 --> 00:14:09,483
The life of Addison Montgomery
in ten minutes or less.

257
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:12,552
- Well, you can have 11 minutes.
- Don't need it.

258
00:14:12,653 --> 00:14:14,678
Here it goes :

259
00:14:14,755 --> 00:14:17,223
Never been married, never had kids.

260
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:20,260
Want to get married, want to have kids.

261
00:14:21,262 --> 00:14:24,425
A man without baggage. That is rare.

262
00:14:24,498 --> 00:14:28,662
Well, I have a little baggage
to confess.

263
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:32,227
I'm a...
a patient of Dr. Turner's.

264
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:37,267
I've been seeing her almost a year.
And I can say, without a doubt,

265
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:39,073
that she's made me a better man.

266
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:41,171
OK.

267
00:14:42,783 --> 00:14:45,513
OK. It's, um...

268
00:14:45,586 --> 00:14:47,247
It's refreshing

269
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:51,087
to meet someone who's
interested in being a better man.

270
00:14:51,158 --> 00:14:53,888
- Really ?
- Yes. Really.

271
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:56,327
- [Phone ringing]
- Oh.

272
00:14:56,397 --> 00:15:00,333
I have to take this. Excuse me. Hello ?

273
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:02,494
Her name is Darcy.

274
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,471
She said to wait, she'd meet us.

275
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,573
Darcy.

276
00:15:17,651 --> 00:15:19,516
It's a girl.

277
00:15:19,587 --> 00:15:22,681
She's not... She isn't crying.

278
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:25,520
- I can take a look at her.
- Are you bleeding ?

279
00:15:25,593 --> 00:15:28,460
- Let us take you to the clinic.
- No. Just take it and go.

280
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:30,156
My mom's upstairs sleeping.

281
00:15:30,231 --> 00:15:33,598
Your mother was here in the house
when you were...

282
00:15:33,701 --> 00:15:37,262
I crawled on the top bunk, played my
stereo to cover the contractions.

283
00:15:37,338 --> 00:15:40,034
- You cut the cord...
- I clipped it.

284
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:42,598
See ? With a barrette.

285
00:15:43,244 --> 00:15:45,508
You made the right decision by calling.

286
00:15:45,579 --> 00:15:48,275
Give me five minutes.
I'll do an exam quickly.

287
00:15:48,349 --> 00:15:50,442
Make sure there aren't any problems.

288
00:15:50,518 --> 00:15:54,181
Darcy ? It's a little late
to have friends over.

289
00:15:54,255 --> 00:15:57,122
Sorry, Mom. You have to go. Now.

290
00:15:57,191 --> 00:16:00,319
Take my card. And a bracelet.

291
00:16:00,394 --> 00:16:03,158
- Your daughter has a matching one.
- I... Just go !

292
00:16:03,264 --> 00:16:05,391
- In case you change your mind.
- I won't.

293
00:16:08,536 --> 00:16:09,901
[Coughing]

294
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:12,233
- Hey.
- Sam.

295
00:16:12,306 --> 00:16:15,673
- The ambulance is here.
- Sam. May I show him ? Please.

296
00:16:15,743 --> 00:16:18,007
I felt fine.

297
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:20,743
Oh.

298
00:16:23,284 --> 00:16:25,309
- Naomi.
- Yeah, I know. I see it.

299
00:16:25,386 --> 00:16:27,513
Not just Sister Helen and
Sister Virginia.

300
00:16:27,588 --> 00:16:29,488
- Sam.
- Hey ! No, no ! Don't come in !

301
00:16:29,557 --> 00:16:31,684
This building is a hot zone.
Lock it down.

302
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,250
Until we figure out what this is,
nobody in or out.

303
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:37,422
- I am not leaving them.
- Shut the door then. Shut the door.

304
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,408
[Sam] Saint Ambrose spoke to the CDC.

305
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:50,477
They said we were right to lock down

306
00:16:50,578 --> 00:16:53,809
until the hospitals can prep some
isolation units for them.

307
00:16:53,881 --> 00:16:55,849
Or us.

308
00:16:56,984 --> 00:16:58,508
What do they think this is ?

309
00:16:58,586 --> 00:17:03,285
Probably viral contagion.
Considering where these nuns have been.

310
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:06,884
Dell forwarded the pictures on to
an infectious disease specialist,

311
00:17:06,961 --> 00:17:09,486
- we'll know as soon as he hears back.
- All right.

312
00:17:09,563 --> 00:17:12,088
How long until the iso unit's prepped ?

313
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,929
- Six hours.
- OK.

314
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:15,934
Three more sisters have a fever,

315
00:17:16,003 --> 00:17:20,372
so that makes eight of the 12,
and I'm not feeling too good.

316
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:27,046
Still don't think
God's trying to tell us something ?

317
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:31,780
You don't think we're being punished
for what we did last night ?

318
00:17:32,653 --> 00:17:34,917
What, just because we may have some

319
00:17:34,989 --> 00:17:38,857
rare tropical, probably deadly disease ?

320
00:17:38,926 --> 00:17:41,622
The morning after we have sex ?

321
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:45,764
Well, if we are sick...

322
00:17:47,868 --> 00:17:49,733
I'm glad we got some.

323
00:17:51,205 --> 00:17:54,732
- How sentimental.
- That was a joke. I was joking.

324
00:17:54,808 --> 00:17:59,507
Yeah, I got to say, that kid did a
good job of giving birth on a bunk bed.

325
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,946
I did a primary check
and she's fine for now.

326
00:18:02,016 --> 00:18:04,109
Her lungs are good, heartbeat's strong.

327
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:06,880
Get Cooper to do
a well baby check tomorrow.

328
00:18:06,954 --> 00:18:10,082
- Or you can call him now.
- Cooper's, um...

329
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:13,218
...out on a date.

330
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:18,060
Oh, God. He's doing his
get back up on the horse thing.

331
00:18:18,165 --> 00:18:20,030
Addison is too. Right ?

332
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,467
You had your date ? How did it go ?

333
00:18:24,238 --> 00:18:28,265
It's OK, Violet. I know Carl's
your patient. He told me.

334
00:18:28,342 --> 00:18:30,207
Oh, good.

335
00:18:31,045 --> 00:18:32,205
Good.

336
00:18:33,681 --> 00:18:36,377
Baby blankets. We need baby blankets.

337
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,008
- [Phone ringing]
- Oh, hey.

338
00:18:38,085 --> 00:18:41,020
You know, that might be
the guy... the nun rash.

339
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:49,125
So you're dating one of Violet's
patients ? A psych patient ?

340
00:18:49,196 --> 00:18:52,063
This is L.A. You're weird
if you're not seeing a shrink.

341
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:54,498
You all done, kiddo ? Huh ?

342
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:57,502
OK. There you go. Good girl.

343
00:18:57,571 --> 00:19:00,506
You want me to call Social Services
to come pick up her up ?

344
00:19:00,574 --> 00:19:04,032
No, no, no. That's OK.,
I'll stay here tonight.

345
00:19:04,111 --> 00:19:06,079
- Are you serious ?
- Yeah, you know.

346
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:08,239
She should get to feel wanted.

347
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:11,443
At least for one night. Huh ?

348
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:13,042
Yeah.

349
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,216
Oh, yeah.
Little girl. That's a little baby.

350
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:22,057
[ ? lke & Tina Turner :
<i>Crazy 'Bout You Baby]</i>

351
00:19:28,802 --> 00:19:32,169
Seven and seven. More on the first
seven, less on the second.

352
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:50,022
Charlotte King, as I live and breathe.

353
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:53,184
- Oh, no you don't. That's saved.
- Big date ?

354
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:56,627
Not a date. Far from it.
I'm just meeting someone.

355
00:19:56,697 --> 00:19:59,962
Scoot. I don't want him to see you
and think you're here with me.

356
00:20:00,634 --> 00:20:02,397
What time did he say ?

357
00:20:04,605 --> 00:20:06,470
9 :00 p.m.

358
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,270
Mmm. I'm meeting someone at 9 :00, too.

359
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,469
[Exhales]

360
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:12,603
A blonde. Petite.

361
00:20:14,014 --> 00:20:16,278
- We met on the internet.
- What ?

362
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,045
- Huh ?
- No.

363
00:20:18,118 --> 00:20:19,278

364
00:20:20,621 --> 00:20:22,555
Oh, God.

365
00:20:22,623 --> 00:20:23,920
- Oh, my God.
- No. No, no.

366
00:20:23,991 --> 00:20:27,017
We should laugh about
the unfortunate coincidence.

367
00:20:27,094 --> 00:20:29,221
Let's be clear. This never happened.

368
00:20:33,467 --> 00:20:35,094
Or the opposite of laughing.

369
00:20:38,305 --> 00:20:40,569
Yes sir, I just got it.

370
00:20:40,641 --> 00:20:44,168
OK. I see. Yeah.
I'll call them right now.

371
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,844
Holy crap.

372
00:20:50,884 --> 00:20:54,217
A patient of yours is dating Addison ?

373
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:56,985
I'm not allowed to discuss it.
You know that.

374
00:20:57,057 --> 00:20:59,548
Yes you are. Our patients know
we share files.

375
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:02,390
- We don't if we don't have to.
- On a scale of one to ten,

376
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:05,226
- how bad is his thing ?
- Moving away, not talking.

377
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:06,664
Are we talking a three ?

378
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:10,829
Like, "I'm afraid of seagulls
and I'm considering hypnotherapy" ?

379
00:21:10,904 --> 00:21:14,203
- I'm closing the door in your face.
- Oh, it's bad, huh ?

380
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:19,041
- We're way beyond mommy issues here ?
- Ethics, Pete. Look it up.

381
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:23,016
Sam.

382
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:26,847
Tachycardic at 130. I can't get
a blood pressure. She's in septic shock.

383
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,354
We've gotta get her to a hospital.

384
00:21:29,423 --> 00:21:32,119
We got to get everybody
to a hospital. Dell called.

385
00:21:32,192 --> 00:21:34,490
- What is it ?
- It's typhoid.

386
00:21:41,935 --> 00:21:45,371
- How is Sister Virginia ?
- Well, she's still not responding.

387
00:21:45,439 --> 00:21:49,170
And her blood pressure is very unstable.

388
00:21:49,243 --> 00:21:53,680
Typhoid ? I didn't even... I thought
it disappeared in like the early 1900s.

389
00:21:53,747 --> 00:21:57,274
It's a common disease in
exactly the kind of Third World places

390
00:21:57,351 --> 00:22:01,913
where the sisters work, transmitted
through skin to skin contact or food.

391
00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:06,255
- One sister caught it on a mission ?
- No. And that's what's troubling.

392
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:09,489
The incubation period
is two weeks at the most.

393
00:22:09,596 --> 00:22:11,689
These sisters were sequestered longer.

394
00:22:11,765 --> 00:22:14,461
So how did they get exposed ?

395
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:17,264
Excuse me. Just one second.

396
00:22:21,942 --> 00:22:23,842
I spoke with Health Services.

397
00:22:23,911 --> 00:22:26,402
No other outbreaks
of typhus in this area.

398
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,210
And all the food in
the convent tested clean.

399
00:22:29,283 --> 00:22:30,841
So, if it's not the food...

400
00:22:31,652 --> 00:22:34,519
Somebody had to have contact
with an outside carrier.

401
00:22:34,588 --> 00:22:38,456
The sisters claim they've been isolated.
Nobody in, nobody out.

402
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:42,689
Sam, what are we saying here ?
That one of these nuns...

403
00:22:42,763 --> 00:22:44,731
We're saying that somebody's lying.

404
00:22:46,767 --> 00:22:50,328
You're not ready to date. You're
certainly not ready to quit therapy.

405
00:22:50,404 --> 00:22:52,429
I feel fine. I feel good.

406
00:22:52,506 --> 00:22:54,736
This is you going off your program.

407
00:22:55,776 --> 00:22:57,505
Hi.

408
00:22:57,577 --> 00:23:00,341
I'm just leaving some flowers
for Addison.

409
00:23:00,447 --> 00:23:04,611
She's sleeping, so,
make sure she gets these, OK ?

410
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:06,151
Thanks.

411
00:23:13,427 --> 00:23:14,394
Seizure ?

412
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:16,985
Addison's date was
with a patient of Violet's.

413
00:23:17,064 --> 00:23:20,033
- Now Violet seems worried.
- No way.

414
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,465
Awesome. What's his deal ?

415
00:23:22,502 --> 00:23:25,130
If it was nothing, she would say.
You know you'd say.

416
00:23:26,473 --> 00:23:28,498
Just a hint.
You don't have to tell us...

417
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:30,440
He calls himself "Trunk."

418
00:23:32,379 --> 00:23:34,244
OK.

419
00:23:34,314 --> 00:23:38,273
When I think "trunk" in relation to
a guy... not necessarily a bad thing.

420
00:23:38,352 --> 00:23:42,914
Elephants, trunks, very large...
Oh, is he freakishly large ?

421
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:46,050
- Is he hideously...
- I can't tell you !

422
00:23:48,328 --> 00:23:49,386
"Trunk."

423
00:23:56,203 --> 00:23:57,329
Aww.

424
00:23:57,404 --> 00:23:59,463
- Flowers.
- How you holding up ?

425
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:02,007
Good. A little hungry.

426
00:24:02,075 --> 00:24:05,704
A lot tired. And I can...

427
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:08,145
...can only find one shoe.

428
00:24:08,248 --> 00:24:12,617
Every time I try to put her down
she started screeching like a bat.

429
00:24:12,686 --> 00:24:13,846
Eee-eee-eee.

430
00:24:15,188 --> 00:24:17,952
OK, you realize I didn't
actually give birth.

431
00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:22,551
From your psych patient.
He just dropped them off.

432
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:25,120
That's so sweet.
Here, give me the card.

433
00:24:28,335 --> 00:24:32,499
Uh, the thing is, I think Carl
might have some problems.

434
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,876
- Everybody has problems.
- Violet said his nickname is Trunk.

435
00:24:36,943 --> 00:24:40,674
- I don't know what that means.
- I think it means...

436
00:24:41,948 --> 00:24:46,009
...he's not Addison Montgomery material.
That's all.

437
00:24:46,086 --> 00:24:50,182
No. You don't know what my material is.

438
00:24:50,257 --> 00:24:53,522
You've never even seen my material,
remember ?

439
00:24:53,593 --> 00:24:56,858
So, mind your own business.

440
00:24:58,131 --> 00:25:00,258
- Huh ? Huh ?
- [Baby grunts]

441
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:03,097
Oh. Eee-eee-eee.

442
00:25:06,706 --> 00:25:08,731
She isn't getting any better, is she ?

443
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:11,937
No, not yet. Her lungs are congested.

444
00:25:12,012 --> 00:25:13,775
Pressure's borderline.

445
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:17,749
I'm putting all the sisters on an
aggressive course of antibiotics.

446
00:25:17,818 --> 00:25:21,982
It's a dangerous disease, but the cure
rate is high for those with mild cases.

447
00:25:22,055 --> 00:25:24,023
Thank you, Sam.

448
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:28,190
Father... there you go...

449
00:25:28,261 --> 00:25:31,230
...Naomi's going to ask
the sisters some questions.

450
00:25:31,298 --> 00:25:32,731
Anything you need.

451
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,427
Is there anyone
you think we should speak to ?

452
00:25:35,502 --> 00:25:38,938
A sister that might have had contact
with a typhoid carrier

453
00:25:39,005 --> 00:25:40,939
in the time they were sequestered ?

454
00:25:41,007 --> 00:25:42,235
From the outside ?

455
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:46,439
Maybe a sister was meeting
with someone secretly.

456
00:25:46,513 --> 00:25:49,482
No, no. I can't imagine
someone would lie about that.

457
00:25:49,583 --> 00:25:52,882
Well, people keep secrets, Father.
Believe me.

458
00:25:55,922 --> 00:25:58,686
I got a page from the ER.
Dr. Violet Turner.

459
00:25:58,758 --> 00:26:02,626
Oh, hi. Yeah, you have a patient here.

460
00:26:02,696 --> 00:26:05,790
We were able to remove the foreign
body non-surgically.

461
00:26:05,866 --> 00:26:10,200
He's on pain meds now.
Seems to be resting comfortably.

462
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,700
- Is he going to be OK ?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

463
00:26:12,772 --> 00:26:17,266
Yeah, he's lucky
he didn't perforate his bowel.

464
00:26:18,178 --> 00:26:20,544
Just one question for you.

465
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:23,177
You got any idea whose shoe this is ?

466
00:26:29,489 --> 00:26:31,252
The circumstances of the birth,

467
00:26:31,358 --> 00:26:34,919
this is a very, very healthy baby.

468
00:26:35,028 --> 00:26:38,191
- Did you hear that ?
- I heard we had something to celebrate ?

469
00:26:38,298 --> 00:26:40,789
- You rescued a baby ?
- Yeah.

470
00:26:40,867 --> 00:26:42,425
What exactly happens

471
00:26:42,502 --> 00:26:46,598
once Social Services takes her ?

472
00:26:46,673 --> 00:26:48,231
It's out of our hands.

473
00:26:48,341 --> 00:26:52,004
She'll be placed in foster care while
they start the adoption process.

474
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:59,885
Come here, Batgirl. Yes.

475
00:26:59,953 --> 00:27:04,219
Time for a little stroll.
A little stroll around the office ? Yeah.

476
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:06,316
Batgirl ?

477
00:27:14,034 --> 00:27:17,333
Here's a question. Cotton balls
at St. Ambrose. Do you...

478
00:27:18,238 --> 00:27:20,934
Triple size. Hospital grade.

479
00:27:21,007 --> 00:27:22,872
Right. More cotton per ball.

480
00:27:26,913 --> 00:27:28,574
Goodbye, Dr. Freedman.

481
00:27:28,648 --> 00:27:30,206
Goodbye, CanUHandleMe.

482
00:27:37,524 --> 00:27:39,048
I didn't mean to take her shoe.

483
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:41,889
You took her shoe, Carl.
And you did what you always do.

484
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:46,893
- Yeah.
- You need to come back to therapy.

485
00:27:46,967 --> 00:27:48,935
This is not a good way to live, is it ?

486
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:50,435
No.

487
00:27:53,073 --> 00:27:55,041
One more thing.

488
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:57,974
Can you tell Addison I can't see her ?

489
00:27:58,044 --> 00:27:59,807
She's great, she's perfect.

490
00:28:00,847 --> 00:28:03,611
But I don't trust myself
around her shoes.

491
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,593
How do you give up your baby ?

492
00:28:15,662 --> 00:28:17,789
<i>[Naomi] How do you give up</i>
<i>your whole life ?</i>

493
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:20,128
Falling in love, a family, all of it,

494
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,361
just to go live in a convent ?

495
00:28:23,503 --> 00:28:25,164
That's why somebody's lying.

496
00:28:25,872 --> 00:28:28,636
This girl, Darcy ?

497
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:32,166
She carried her for nine months,
I've had her for one night,

498
00:28:32,245 --> 00:28:33,906
one night,

499
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:37,939
and the thought of her being thrown
into some foster home is killing me.

500
00:28:38,018 --> 00:28:41,454
You can't have this baby, Addison.

501
00:28:43,056 --> 00:28:45,115
I know.

502
00:28:46,126 --> 00:28:50,222
I named her. Batgirl.

503
00:28:50,297 --> 00:28:53,755
OK. You just can't have kids.

the world, but years ago.

can stay dormant for years.

she was just so graceful, smart.

I would ask her for pointers.

- Ask me again in two hours.
- Yes, ma'am.

676
00:40:39,605 --> 00:40:41,334
You heading out ?

677
00:40:43,509 --> 00:40:47,843
I don't think I can be
in this day any longer.

678
00:40:47,913 --> 00:40:51,144
- You shouldn't be alone tonight.
- I won't be.

[ ? Leona Naess : <i>Learning As We Go]</i>

680
00:40:57,857 --> 00:40:59,222
- Hey.
- I'm sorry,

681
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:02,454
- I know it's past neighbor time.
- No, come in. It's cold.

682
00:41:08,601 --> 00:41:11,092
Can I get you anything ?
Some tea or wine ?

683
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:12,728
Wine.

684
00:41:14,507 --> 00:41:18,443
I called Naomi, but, uh...

685
00:41:18,511 --> 00:41:20,376
...no one answered.

686
00:41:22,681 --> 00:41:24,706
You want to talk about it ?

687
00:41:26,652 --> 00:41:30,281
It was, um... a night.

688
00:41:30,356 --> 00:41:34,292
You know ? Just a night.

689
00:41:35,094 --> 00:41:39,258
And, like, I called Naomi

690
00:41:39,365 --> 00:41:43,734
and she wasn't home.
I just couldn't go home yet.

691
00:41:46,439 --> 00:41:47,872
Hey.

00:41:53,279 --> 00:41:55,372
