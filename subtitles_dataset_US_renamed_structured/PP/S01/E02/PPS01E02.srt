[ ? Frank Popp Ensemble : <i>Leave Me Alone]</i>

2
00:00:04,606 --> 00:00:06,836
[Addison] What are you people
doing in my house ?

3
00:00:06,908 --> 00:00:09,069
- Told you, it's a surprise.
- [Pete] For Sam.

4
00:00:09,177 --> 00:00:11,509
- You know about this ?
- Sadly, I do.

5
00:00:11,579 --> 00:00:14,742
[Addison] If it's a surprise for Sam,
why aren't you at Sam's house ?

6
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:17,579
- Put that down.
- That would totally ruin the surprise.

7
00:00:17,652 --> 00:00:21,179
- What are you doing ?
- Cooper thinks Sam's in a rut.

8
00:00:22,156 --> 00:00:24,852
Well, I am not in a rut, OK ?
In fact, I have plans.

9
00:00:24,926 --> 00:00:27,087
- You have plans ? With who ?
- With Naomi.

10
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:28,219
Oh.

11
00:00:28,296 --> 00:00:31,060
You invited Naomi here ?
No. Actually that's no good.

12
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:33,531
Well, it's good for me.
It's good for Naomi.

13
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:36,502
Naomi is my friend.
You people, I barely know.

14
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:39,506
The thing is, Naomi kind of
steps on the surprise.

15
00:00:39,574 --> 00:00:42,236
What kind of surprise is this ?

16
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,676
One named Ginger.

17
00:00:44,779 --> 00:00:46,906
- What ?
- I'm out of here.

18
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:49,506
She's about to ring the doorbell.

19
00:00:49,584 --> 00:00:51,415
Five minutes.

20
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:56,382
[Sam mumbling]

21
00:00:59,494 --> 00:01:01,462
Ah, OK.

22
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:08,033
- They can't stop us, buddy. Right ?
- [Doorbell rings]

23
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:14,174
[Barking]

24
00:01:16,177 --> 00:01:17,701
Sam ?

25
00:01:21,516 --> 00:01:23,814
[Violet] How do you know
how to find a stripper ?

26
00:01:23,885 --> 00:01:26,786
Ginger is not a stripper.
She's an entertainer.

27
00:01:26,854 --> 00:01:30,483
- What does that even mean ?
- I'm still trying to figure it out.

28
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:33,322
Sam is not like you, Cooper.
He's not interested in...

29
00:01:33,394 --> 00:01:34,918
I think Sam is.

30
00:01:42,537 --> 00:01:46,633
- Sam and a stripper. Who knew.
- Hey ! It's just getting good ! Could...

31
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:51,304
[Naomi] A stripper ?

32
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:00,745
- Oh, you like that ?
- You have something.

33
00:02:00,822 --> 00:02:05,725
- [Laughs] Thanks. You're sweet, too.
- No, you got something right here.

34
00:02:06,561 --> 00:02:08,119
- Huh ?
- Let me get a closer look.

35
00:02:09,063 --> 00:02:11,429
Uh, yeah.

36
00:02:19,707 --> 00:02:22,437
Hey, man. What were you thinking ?

37
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,410
It's a long, sad story.

38
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:27,539
Did she do the thing where she...
could be pneumonia.

39
00:02:27,615 --> 00:02:30,516
- Set them up with an X-ray.
- You're not fooling anybody.

40
00:02:30,585 --> 00:02:32,712
Who's up first ?

41
00:02:32,787 --> 00:02:36,621
Dave Walker called this morning,
complaining of headache and nausea.

42
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:38,852
- His wife left him.
- He's drinking again.

43
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,986
Got his son and mother living
with him. I'll check him out.

44
00:02:42,063 --> 00:02:45,123
- You do house calls too ?
- We. We all do house calls.

45
00:02:46,134 --> 00:02:47,795
- What ?
- Nothing.

46
00:02:47,869 --> 00:02:51,236
The O'Brien's bringing their baby
in again. Nine month-old girl.

47
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:53,136
She's been sick since birth.

48
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:57,303
- Is that the Dad...
- He's disconnected from this baby.

49
00:02:57,378 --> 00:03:00,541
- I tried to get him to see you, no go.
- Let me know if I can help.

50
00:03:00,615 --> 00:03:02,583
Want to help me ?

51
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,709
- What ?
- Anything else ?

52
00:03:05,553 --> 00:03:09,114
- You have two cases next week...
- Nobody ? Super.

53
00:03:10,725 --> 00:03:15,025
Pete, do you think acupuncture could
help with a patient that's presenting...

54
00:03:15,096 --> 00:03:18,224
Could you tell me...
did she do the triple-jointed thing ?

55
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:20,733
- I'll be leaving.
- Does it even occur to you

56
00:03:20,802 --> 00:03:23,270
to think of Naomi's feelings ?

57
00:03:25,807 --> 00:03:28,901
So wait. Do they know ?
[Gasps]

58
00:03:28,976 --> 00:03:31,740
- Does Naomi know ?
- Back to the triple-jointed thing.

59
00:03:31,846 --> 00:03:36,112
It looks like it hurts, but in the most
awesomest way. Look. Does she do this ?

60
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:40,379
Amber Johnson ?

61
00:03:40,455 --> 00:03:44,323
- Hey. Are you mad at me ?
- Amber Johnson ?

62
00:03:44,392 --> 00:03:47,555
Because it seemed like you
were mad at me. In the meeting.

63
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:49,926
I'm just looking out for Naomi.
Hey. Amber.

64
00:03:51,032 --> 00:03:52,590
See you next week, Thomas.

65
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:56,364
Addison is mad at me
because Cooper hired a stripper.

66
00:03:56,437 --> 00:03:59,600
I'm ignoring the stripper.
Today is a day for ignoring things.

67
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:01,868
I am all business today.

68
00:04:01,976 --> 00:04:04,740
- Who's my next patient ?
- This guy wants to talk to you.

69
00:04:04,846 --> 00:04:07,007
Sign, please.

70
00:04:10,885 --> 00:04:13,217
- Oh, no.
- It's a nice bike.

71
00:04:14,956 --> 00:04:15,923
No ? OK.

72
00:04:21,896 --> 00:04:23,921
[Cooper] Emily's gained weight. Good.

73
00:04:23,998 --> 00:04:26,899
- Has she been sleeping ?
- Better. Don't you think ?

74
00:04:26,968 --> 00:04:28,526
No. I don't, actually.

75
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:34,701
I said it was going to be a long haul
when she was born with these symptoms.

76
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,437
I just feel like when is she
going to catch a break ?

77
00:04:37,512 --> 00:04:40,845
Well... Here you go.

78
00:04:40,915 --> 00:04:44,783
Come here, Emily.
Look at that guy. Where's that guy ?

79
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:50,918
You know, just to be safe, I am going
to run a couple more blood tests.

80
00:04:51,025 --> 00:04:54,517
- She hates needles.
- If it was optional, I wouldn't do it.

81
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,866
OK ?

82
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:05,867
Did you know you have an office here ?

83
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,068
- It's right next door.
- I am asking because I am curious.

84
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:12,203
Not because I care. What's her name ?

85
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,770
- Whose name ?
- The girl.

86
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:16,476
The girl, Sam.

87
00:05:19,353 --> 00:05:20,513
Ginger.

88
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:23,647
- Her name is Ginger ?
- Hey, I did not name her.

89
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:26,784
I didn't hold her up to the moon
and do the Kunta Kinte thing.

90
00:05:26,861 --> 00:05:29,955
- This isn't <i>Roots.</i>
- Oh, you funny. You funny man.

91
00:05:30,031 --> 00:05:31,328
Her name is Ginger.

92
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:34,167
Did you sleep with Ginger ?

93
00:05:34,235 --> 00:05:36,567
And you're asking
because you're curious ?

94
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:38,002
Yeah.

95
00:05:38,072 --> 00:05:40,370
- Yes.
- Samuel !

96
00:05:40,441 --> 00:05:42,966
No. I didn't. [chuckles]

97
00:05:43,044 --> 00:05:46,172
I just wanted to see
what "curiosity" looked like.

98
00:05:46,247 --> 00:05:48,010
Looks an awful lot like jealousy.

99
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:51,607
- I am not jealous.
- Oh, yes, you are.

100
00:05:57,425 --> 00:06:00,986
If I want to see a stripper,
I'm going to see a stripper.

101
00:06:01,095 --> 00:06:04,929
Shoot. I'm grown.

102
00:06:06,267 --> 00:06:09,430
Trying to tell me. Come on, Dave.

103
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:11,767
I know you didn't go to work.

104
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:18,570
Dave probably gets to see strippers.
Probably got one right now.

105
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:22,809
I know he didn't make me come here
for nothing, Dave. Come on.

106
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,587
Dave !

107
00:06:29,023 --> 00:06:32,959
Dave ! Dave, open the door !

108
00:06:33,027 --> 00:06:35,962
Miss Walker, open up the door !

109
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,395
Op...

110
00:06:47,341 --> 00:06:49,707
- How long has he been like this ?
- I don't know.

111
00:06:49,777 --> 00:06:52,302
I just came downstairs and he was...
I don't know.

112
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,610
Miss Walker ? How long
has he been like this ?

113
00:06:54,682 --> 00:06:56,240
Grandma !

114
00:06:56,317 --> 00:07:00,253
Yes, this is Dr. Sam Bennett.
I need an ambulance immediately.

115
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:08,260
- [Sirens wailing]
- Dave, what happened in there ?

116
00:07:08,329 --> 00:07:13,289
I don't know. I had breakfast,
getting ready for work.

117
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:15,164
Next thing, I'm hugging the toilet.

118
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:18,397
- What's wrong with him ?
- At the hospital we'll figure it out.

119
00:07:18,472 --> 00:07:21,407
- But he's coming back ?
- Of course I am, Stevie.

120
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:26,571
I don't want you here by yourself.

121
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:29,172
I'm OK. My grandmother's here.

122
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,150
Yeah.

123
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:34,847
Fellas, would you mind taking the boy
and his grandmother with you ?

124
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:37,857
I'm worried about
leaving her in charge. All right.

125
00:07:41,062 --> 00:07:43,690
Do you want to talk about Sam's...

126
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:47,393
- Well, not Sam's... Clearly not...
- Oh, come on. Will you say it ?

127
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:51,097
Sam's stripper. Sam's stripper.
Say it. So what ?

128
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:55,806
So, I mean, Sam's single. I'm single.

129
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:59,505
- So single. And single people move on.
- Yeah.

130
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,276
Sorry, but looking at this
in my office all day...

131
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,318
- You bought a bike ?
- Custom-built.

132
00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:07,581
It's from Italy. And Allan is never
getting his hands on it.

133
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:11,522
- Ever. I don't care if it cost $6,000.
- Bought Allan a $6,000 bike ?

134
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:15,494
I ordered it last year.
It just arrived today. On his birthday.

135
00:08:15,563 --> 00:08:17,326
- Oh.
- Brutal.

136
00:08:17,398 --> 00:08:21,630
- Why don't you sell it ?
- Yeah. Yeah, maybe I will.

137
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:24,466
- Or give it away. Just...
- Great. Exactly.

138
00:08:24,572 --> 00:08:26,540
I'm going to give it away.

139
00:08:27,408 --> 00:08:31,902
Hey. Hey.
You will not give Allan that bike.

140
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:34,345
- I won't ?
- Will you be strong ?

141
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,208
Yeah.

142
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:41,043
Strong.

143
00:08:41,122 --> 00:08:44,421
I told my teacher there's probably
no way you could do it, but...

144
00:08:44,492 --> 00:08:46,756
- Do what ?
- Speak at my midwifery class.

145
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:50,319
I told my teacher about Naomi,
she called you a "primal life giver."

146
00:08:50,398 --> 00:08:54,334
- I think I have something that night.
- Come on. Do it.

147
00:08:54,402 --> 00:08:58,634
- It might give you a boost.
- I don't need boosting. I'm fine.

148
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:07,507
I'll do it. I love talking to midwiffs.

149
00:09:08,883 --> 00:09:11,443
Actually,
I think we're good on OBs, but...

150
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,387
Oh no, I'm actually a double-board
certified, neonatal surgeon.

151
00:09:15,456 --> 00:09:19,790
- Mmm...
- One of the best. In the world.

152
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:22,556
With a specialty in genetics.

153
00:09:24,098 --> 00:09:25,998
- DNA.
- Well, yeah, maybe.

154
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,432
You know, if someone drops out.

155
00:09:28,536 --> 00:09:33,599
You can't get more primal
and life-giving than DNA. Dell ?

156
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:36,837
Excuse me, do you still have time
for that consult ?

157
00:09:37,178 --> 00:09:39,078
- The little girl ?
- Yeah.

158
00:09:39,547 --> 00:09:42,914
- Please tell me I'm reading that wrong.
- Oh.

159
00:09:43,017 --> 00:09:45,076
Cooper asked for a second opinion.

160
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:48,121
But the genetic tests we ran
confirmed that

161
00:09:48,222 --> 00:09:52,921
Emily has a serious presentation
of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease.

162
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:56,421
- How do we cure it ?
- Well, there's a medication

163
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,760
to treat the symptoms,
but there is no cure.

164
00:10:00,768 --> 00:10:01,826
So, she's...

165
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:04,732
...not going to get better ?

166
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:07,229
Ever ?

167
00:10:07,308 --> 00:10:09,071
The drugs can give her five years.

168
00:10:09,176 --> 00:10:10,939
- Five years ? Five ?
- What ?

169
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:13,377
I'm sorry. I know this
is difficult to hear.

170
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:17,611
- And we will do everything that we can.
- Wait. You said that this was genetic.

171
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:20,482
- One of us made her sick ?
- You can't think like that.

172
00:10:20,588 --> 00:10:23,955
My sister's trying to get pregnant.
Could she have this too ?

173
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:28,085
We'll have to run some blood tests,
see which mutation you're carrying.

174
00:10:28,162 --> 00:10:29,925
It's important for your sister,

175
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:33,763
also for you, if and when
you decide you want other children.

176
00:10:33,868 --> 00:10:37,565
No. Emily. Emily is all we need.

177
00:10:44,345 --> 00:10:46,472
Excuse me. I'm looking
for a Dave Walker.

178
00:10:46,547 --> 00:10:49,311
He came in with vomiting
and severe dehydration.

179
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,018
He was released 15 minutes ago.

180
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,780
On whose orders ?

181
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:57,289
Don't release my patient
without calling me.

182
00:10:57,358 --> 00:10:59,519
Don't lecture me on medical etiquette.

183
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:02,426
Vitals were normal, we needed bays,
he wanted to leave.

184
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:05,465
- Probably had some 24 hour bug.
- It didn't look like a bug.

185
00:11:05,533 --> 00:11:08,866
He was unconscious when I found him,
said it was something he ate,

186
00:11:08,936 --> 00:11:11,427
but tested negative for E. Coli,
salmonella...

187
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:14,804
Still, 100 possibilities.
None which require hospital stays.

188
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:19,175
He was fine, Sam. Besides,
Grandma said she could handle it.

189
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,239
The same grandma who couldn't call 911 ?

190
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:26,545
That's why you don't
release my patients without calling me.

191
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:31,722
Any word back about the girl ?

192
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:34,658
Yeah, but the test results
don't make any sense.

193
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:37,788
Sometimes they can be hard to read.
Let me see.

194
00:11:41,936 --> 00:11:45,599
You see the...
This doesn't make any sense.

195
00:11:45,673 --> 00:11:48,403
Which mutation did the parents
pass on to Emily ?

196
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:50,773
- None.
- Well, how is that possible ?

197
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:53,977
Because they're not her parents.

198
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:03,389
Emily is ours. She's my baby.

199
00:12:03,457 --> 00:12:06,017
There's the chance
that this was human error...

200
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:09,220
...the hospital nursery
wristbands fell off, got mixed up.

201
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:11,526
[Addison] There is also the possibility

202
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:15,330
that someone may have
done this on purpose.

203
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:18,371
Are you accusing us ? I mean,
you think that we wanted this ?

204
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:21,806
Right now, you take care of Emily
and we'll find out what happened.

205
00:12:27,181 --> 00:12:30,810
Something's wrong with him. Tell him
his daughter is dying, he's cold.

206
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:33,546
Tell him he's not the father,
he gets defensive.

207
00:12:33,621 --> 00:12:35,748
People react
to terrible news differently.

208
00:12:35,823 --> 00:12:38,383
It's his child. Show some emotion.

209
00:12:38,492 --> 00:12:41,518
- Where did Beth give birth ?
- Saint Ambrose.

210
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:44,155
- Charlotte King's hospital.
- I'm going there.

211
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:47,200
You need to stay here and
just calm down. We'll go.

212
00:12:47,301 --> 00:12:48,632
Fine.

213
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:53,165
Where are those nursery records ?

214
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,801
There was no stolen baby reported.
Not in this hospital.

215
00:12:56,877 --> 00:12:58,242
Not while I was Chief.

216
00:12:58,345 --> 00:13:02,111
Well then, two sets of parents
went home with the wrong babies.

217
00:13:02,216 --> 00:13:06,380
I swear, do you all take some kind of
perverse pleasure in ruining my life ?

218
00:13:06,487 --> 00:13:09,456
There are switched babies out
there, but this is about us.

219
00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:12,083
This hospital has
the best nurses in the city.

220
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:15,253
Neonate spent a fortune on security.

221
00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:18,696
Did Saint Ambrose institute nap time
or do I still have a staff ?

222
00:13:18,766 --> 00:13:20,859
[Addison] Show us records
for other babies

223
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:23,630
that were in the nursery
the time Emily was there.

224
00:13:29,777 --> 00:13:32,109
Will someone just... Thank you.

225
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:40,142
There was only one other
African-American girl in the nursery.

226
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,154
Who is it ?

227
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:50,087
This hospital spent 124 years
building its reputation.

228
00:13:50,164 --> 00:13:52,928
I am not going to ruin that
by chatting with you.

229
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,367
- Can you just give us the name ?
- Not until I talk to our attorneys.

230
00:13:58,572 --> 00:14:02,338
Blood pressure 125 over 84.
That's normal.

231
00:14:03,277 --> 00:14:05,302
- I feel a lot better.
- OK.

232
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:08,143
Maybe a little shaky.
What do you think it was ?

233
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:09,806
Still not sure.

234
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:13,683
Just to be safe, why don't you clean
the kitchen, top to bottom.

235
00:14:13,787 --> 00:14:16,153
- It's not food that got him sick.
- Ma, please.

236
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:21,093
- Close the door, honey.
- [Stevie] I'll leave it open.

237
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:24,722
The next time Dad passes out no one's
got to break a window to get in.

238
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:27,358
Hey, Stevie. Is he OK ?

239
00:14:27,468 --> 00:14:30,835
Oh, he's just bullheaded like his dad.
What are you going to do ?

240
00:14:30,938 --> 00:14:33,771
- And your mom ?
- We're doing real good, doc.

241
00:14:34,408 --> 00:14:36,035
Things are good.

242
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:43,077
[Sam] What am I missing ?

243
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:46,415
Well, 90% of cases, it comes down
to history and environment.

244
00:14:46,487 --> 00:14:49,251
The environment's all messed up.
Dad's drinking,

245
00:14:49,323 --> 00:14:52,258
Grandma's got more than she
can handle, kid's acting out.

246
00:14:52,326 --> 00:14:54,487
Sounds a lot more serious
than a 24 hour flu.

247
00:14:54,595 --> 00:14:58,759
See, that's why I'm worried.
They've got enough to deal with as is.

248
00:14:58,832 --> 00:15:02,598
If David's got something serious,
I'm not sure how they hold it together.

249
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:05,832
- Hey, Coop !
- Hey. Ginger !

250
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:08,374
I didn't recognize you in...

251
00:15:08,442 --> 00:15:10,910
- I didn't recognize you. Hey.
- Hey.

252
00:15:12,513 --> 00:15:15,380
Tell me that is not the girl
from last night.

253
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:20,113
- Cooper's bringing them to work now ?
- That's it. He's just crossed the line.

254
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:25,117
- Sam just hugged a stripper.
- With Cooper, you know what you have.

255
00:15:25,192 --> 00:15:29,094
OK, now, let's all calm down.
Sam is not a dog. He never was.

256
00:15:29,163 --> 00:15:33,122
There could be a totally innocent
explanation for this.

257
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:36,293
What, for stripper hugging ?
Give me one. Give me one.

258
00:15:39,907 --> 00:15:42,137
Like she's here to see the real dog.

259
00:15:43,811 --> 00:15:46,371
Oh, would you look at him.

260
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:51,573
He's all, "I'm a doctor.
My touch heals."

261
00:15:55,522 --> 00:15:57,183
Can I talk to you ?

262
00:15:58,192 --> 00:16:00,217
- I spoke to our attorneys.
- And ?

263
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:02,854
Some days I really hate
the Hippocratic oath.

264
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:07,489
Here is the file
on the second African-American baby

265
00:16:07,568 --> 00:16:09,092
in the hospital nursery.

266
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:11,467
You're just giving it to us ?
Just like that ?

267
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:14,598
If you think I'm being nice,
read the name.

268
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:18,075
- Oh, God.
- What ?

269
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:22,411
- And my problem becomes your problem.
- Melinda and Duncan Stinson.

270
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:26,043
- You know them ?
- I got them pregnant.

271
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:34,353
[Duncan] What do you think
of your handiwork ?

272
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:35,894
[Naomi] Oh, she is so cute.

273
00:16:35,963 --> 00:16:39,228
If you tell me I've got more hormones
to take I'm going to scream.

274
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:44,134
No. It's just we need to run
some blood tests on all of you.

275
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:46,069
What's going on ?

276
00:16:47,808 --> 00:16:49,776
So how are you holding up ?

277
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:53,006
I'll be better
when we find out who did this.

278
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,540
- All your nurses check out ?
- One moved a few days later.

279
00:16:57,618 --> 00:16:59,586
But her record was impeccable.

280
00:16:59,653 --> 00:17:02,918
- Something happened in that nursery.
- You don't know that.

281
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,754
Doesn't stop you
from tossing the blame my way.

282
00:17:05,826 --> 00:17:08,659
I know that if one of my patients
was in this much pain,

283
00:17:08,729 --> 00:17:11,220
I would be busting my ass
looking for answers.

284
00:17:11,298 --> 00:17:12,788
Thank you.

285
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:16,563
I hadn't gotten my earful
of Oceanside arrogance today.

286
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:22,873
Look at him.

287
00:17:22,976 --> 00:17:28,243
How is that guy and the guy who hired
me a stripper the same person ?

288
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,579
He's Cooper.

289
00:17:32,486 --> 00:17:36,855
So this other couple, their baby
was born the same night ?

290
00:17:36,924 --> 00:17:38,414
That's right.

291
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:40,653
We're running blood tests on them now.

292
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:43,491
What if the other blood tests
come back positive ?

293
00:17:45,332 --> 00:17:47,266
This is the hard part.

294
00:17:48,936 --> 00:17:52,030
According to California law,

295
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:56,235
you would say goodbye to Emily

296
00:17:57,844 --> 00:17:59,903
and welcome a new child
into your lives.

297
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,710
That's ridiculous. OK ?

298
00:18:02,783 --> 00:18:05,650
The blood tests are not
going to come back positive.

299
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:08,244
- I don't care what blood tests say.
- Honey...

300
00:18:08,322 --> 00:18:11,348
No ! No ! I know Emily
is my daughter, OK ?

301
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:13,655
A mother can feel these things.

302
00:18:13,727 --> 00:18:16,218
That I don't love that other child.

303
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:18,764
I couldn't love another baby.

304
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:20,197
I love Emily.

305
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:27,396
Why don't we just wait for the results
of the blood tests and go from there ?

306
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:32,173
Emily's had a hard time,
now she has to adjust to a new family ?

307
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:33,803
The babies are young.

308
00:18:33,914 --> 00:18:37,179
Adoptions take place at this age all
the time. Kids are fine.

309
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,708
It's the parents I'm worried about.
They're the ones who grieve.

310
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:42,311
Greg O'Brien isn't grieving.

311
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:45,881
What is up with you and this case ?
Your emotional attachment is huge.

312
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:49,326
You're one to lecture about
unhealthy emotional attachments.

313
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:53,957
OK. That was a nice deflection.
But unlike you, I am detaching.

314
00:18:54,034 --> 00:18:56,468
You want to try it ? It's yours.

315
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:00,631
Light.

316
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:02,572
Why didn't Allan buy his own bike ?

317
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:06,510
On our third anniversary, you know,
we took that trip to Italy.

318
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:10,949
He took me to the town where they made
those because even as a child he had...

319
00:19:11,018 --> 00:19:13,782
...he'd wanted one.
So he saved up his money,

320
00:19:14,554 --> 00:19:18,251
but then his dad split on his mom.
So he had to use his savings

321
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:21,453
to pay rent and to keep his mom afloat.

322
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:23,496
He never got the bike.

323
00:19:25,032 --> 00:19:28,058
What ? What ?
Take the bike ! You love it.

324
00:19:28,135 --> 00:19:31,400
I loved it when I thought it was
a cool, sexy, get-me-laid bike,

325
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:34,235
not some sad, Allan-y,
<i>Cat's in the Cradle</i> bike.

326
00:19:39,613 --> 00:19:43,105
Hey ! Is that stripper
still in your office ?

327
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,014
Entertainer, not stripper. And yes.

328
00:19:46,086 --> 00:19:48,714
And she's been in there all day ? Why ?

329
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:53,084
- We're trying different techniques.
- Yeah. I'm sure you are.

330
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:58,096
You know what ? Naomi does not need
Ginger thrown in her face.

331
00:19:58,165 --> 00:20:00,190
Naomi is a big girl. She can handle it.

332
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:02,827
- Doesn't have to. That's why I'm here.
- [Ginger] Pete ?

333
00:20:02,903 --> 00:20:04,336
Is it supposed to feel tingly ?

334
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:07,703
"Pete. Is it supposed to feel..."
You know what ? Go.

335
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:11,335
Go do... Take care of your poor little
stripper girl and her "tingly."

336
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:14,574
Entertainer. Why are you
so angry at me ? Cooper's the one...

337
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:18,014
I am trying to take care of my friend !
Cooper is bad, you're worse.

338
00:20:18,085 --> 00:20:20,417
You know why ?
Because you're slippery. Yeah.

339
00:20:20,487 --> 00:20:24,048
You walk around pretending to be
soulful, but you don't take the heat.

340
00:20:24,157 --> 00:20:28,821
You just do whatever you want to do
and you evade. Evade, evade, evade.

341
00:20:34,201 --> 00:20:35,862
Do you need me to kiss you again ?

342
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:37,994
No !

343
00:20:39,172 --> 00:20:40,469
OK.

344
00:20:49,149 --> 00:20:50,776
You're back.

345
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:53,843
Nurses' schedules.

346
00:20:53,954 --> 00:20:55,421
Perinatal testing.

347
00:20:55,489 --> 00:20:57,389
Personnel files.

348
00:20:58,158 --> 00:21:00,922
- What did you find ?
- Not a damn thing.

349
00:21:01,027 --> 00:21:04,190
I have been through every one
of these backwards and forwards.

350
00:21:04,297 --> 00:21:07,266
You're so sure my hospital
ruined these people's lives ?

351
00:21:07,334 --> 00:21:08,665
Then help me prove it.

352
00:21:10,704 --> 00:21:14,572
Please, will someone hurry ?
Help ! Help me, please !

353
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:16,131
Sam ! Sam ! Front !

354
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:18,143
- Hey ! Hey ! Help !
- Please ! Hurry !

355
00:21:18,211 --> 00:21:20,111
Yeah. I got it.

356
00:21:22,249 --> 00:21:24,183
- Sam !
- Stevie, what's going on ?

357
00:21:24,251 --> 00:21:29,780
Whatever my dad had... [retching]
I got it worse. [moans]

358
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:40,088
I got home, Grandma made
Dad and me some sandwiches, then...

359
00:21:40,167 --> 00:21:41,725
...pukeville.

360
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,962
What did I tell you about that kitchen ?

361
00:21:44,037 --> 00:21:46,699
- It was just a sandwich.
- That could have killed him.

362
00:21:50,544 --> 00:21:53,012
- Where is your father ?
- At work.

363
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:57,379
- I didn't want to bother him with this.
- I understand you mean well,

364
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,476
but something you are doing
is making them sick.

365
00:22:00,554 --> 00:22:04,012
This is a family matter, doctor.
It doesn't concern you.

366
00:22:07,527 --> 00:22:10,985
Dell, can you hand carry
Stevie Walker's blood to the lab for me ?

367
00:22:11,064 --> 00:22:14,431
Put a rush on it. Have them screen
for ingestible poisons.

368
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:15,559
Yeah.

369
00:22:18,605 --> 00:22:19,697
Hey.

370
00:22:19,773 --> 00:22:23,834
I got the test back from the Stinson's.
The O'Brien baby is their baby.

371
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,879
And the Stinson baby
belongs to the O'Brien's.

372
00:22:26,947 --> 00:22:28,437
Yep.

373
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:33,043
How do you tell someone that their baby
was switched with another baby ?

374
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:34,279
Damn it.

375
00:22:36,656 --> 00:22:39,784
[Sobbing]

376
00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:49,266
That was the hardest thing
I've ever done.

377
00:22:49,336 --> 00:22:52,703
- You did everything right.
- And Dad doesn't shed a tear.

378
00:22:52,806 --> 00:22:56,765
- How's it going with Naomi ?
- Well, you know. So far, so good.

379
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:59,902
[Duncan] You know what you put
my wife through, put us through ?

380
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:04,474
And now you tell us that this other
baby, who we've never met, is sick ?

381
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:06,519
We did everything you asked us to do.

382
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,088
I know how hard you two
worked to get pregnant.

383
00:23:09,155 --> 00:23:12,522
Letdown after letdown...
the miscarriages, the hormones,

384
00:23:12,592 --> 00:23:14,526
how many shots I had to stick in her.

385
00:23:14,594 --> 00:23:16,755
She could hardly move,
she was so bruised !

386
00:23:17,631 --> 00:23:20,691
- I wish there was something I could do.
- There is something.

387
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:23,793
You can start by explaining
how you can live with yourself.

388
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:26,031
Taking money,
promising us a healthy baby.

389
00:23:26,139 --> 00:23:31,475
Duncan, I never promised you perfection.
I promised you a child.

390
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:34,104
My retirement ! Vacation pay ! Our future !

391
00:23:34,214 --> 00:23:37,877
- Spent it all to have our little girl !
- Duncan ! Please !

392
00:23:37,951 --> 00:23:42,479
I want my money back.
I want my damn money back !

393
00:23:42,555 --> 00:23:45,115
[Baby wailing]

394
00:23:48,662 --> 00:23:52,689
Your husband,
he has a right to be angry.

395
00:23:54,067 --> 00:23:55,534
So do you.

396
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:01,896
I could just take Sarah and go.
We could just go away.

397
00:24:04,678 --> 00:24:07,806
- No one would find us.
- Except you won't.

398
00:24:10,317 --> 00:24:13,753
Because Emily is your daughter.

399
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,152
And she is sick.

400
00:24:16,222 --> 00:24:19,487
And a mother never
leaves her child behind.

401
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:21,527
Not a strong mother.

402
00:24:24,664 --> 00:24:28,498
No. No. This isn't happening.
I'm not going to do it.

403
00:24:30,036 --> 00:24:31,469
Come on, baby.

404
00:24:39,212 --> 00:24:42,238
Hey. Stevie Walker's lab results.

405
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:47,646
- Coprine ?
- From the mushroom ?

406
00:24:48,521 --> 00:24:52,787
Ink cap mushrooms contain coprine.
It acts like a natural form of Antabuse.

407
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:55,623
Ingest the mushroom
and drink alcohol, you get...

408
00:24:55,695 --> 00:24:59,028
- Really, really sick.
- So someone's poisoning Stevie ?

409
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:07,639
Any luck ?

410
00:25:07,707 --> 00:25:09,971
I think we know when
the switch happened.

411
00:25:10,043 --> 00:25:14,605
We have baby Emily's hospital record
and baby Sarah's hospital records.

412
00:25:14,714 --> 00:25:17,080
And then on day two, they switch.

413
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:19,482
Emily becomes Sarah
and Sarah becomes Emily ?

414
00:25:19,552 --> 00:25:22,112
What about this nurse... left town ?

415
00:25:22,222 --> 00:25:25,191
No. She was in the ER of my hospital.
Laid out with the flu,

416
00:25:25,258 --> 00:25:28,694
- hooked up to an IV all night.
- So we're back to square one ?

417
00:25:29,763 --> 00:25:34,063
My patient is being poisoned
by his own dear sweet mother.

418
00:25:35,802 --> 00:25:38,362
She's dosing him with ink cap mushrooms,

419
00:25:39,105 --> 00:25:42,074
which means he's drinking... boom.
On the floor.

420
00:25:42,142 --> 00:25:44,508
- Baby switch.
- Poisoning ?

421
00:25:44,577 --> 00:25:46,875
For real ? Baby... Hi.

422
00:25:46,946 --> 00:25:51,781
You are not a member of this practice
so you have to go ahead and unhear that.

423
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:55,051
Wow. I thought I had a problem.

424
00:25:55,121 --> 00:25:58,284
We can help you with yours,
since we're not getting anywhere.

425
00:25:58,358 --> 00:26:01,919
I just... I don't know. I got to stop
the mother from hurting her son.

426
00:26:01,995 --> 00:26:06,295
Now she's also poisoning her grandson.
But I can't send her to jail, can I ?

427
00:26:06,366 --> 00:26:08,459
How could a parent do that to a child ?

428
00:26:11,571 --> 00:26:13,801
Let me see the visitors log again.

429
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,440
Yeah.

430
00:26:26,219 --> 00:26:29,780
The first two days, one person
was there constantly.

431
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,727
A parent did that to a child.

432
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:45,297
What you're doing is a crime.
You can't go around poisoning people.

433
00:26:45,371 --> 00:26:49,535
No. I only meant it for David.
I didn't know Stevie was drinking.

434
00:26:49,642 --> 00:26:52,133
So it's OK to poison your own son ?

435
00:26:52,212 --> 00:26:54,442
Every time he takes a drink,
he pays for it.

436
00:26:54,514 --> 00:26:57,039
That's how you teach my David a lesson.

437
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:59,084
You have to stop doing this. Now.

438
00:26:59,152 --> 00:27:02,485
No. My family, we're weak
when it comes to this.

439
00:27:02,555 --> 00:27:05,649
David's not weak, he's an alcoholic.

440
00:27:05,725 --> 00:27:11,027
And some old-world remedy will not
guarantee that he'll stop drinking.

441
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:15,033
- I'm a doctor and I'm telling you...
- What ? You ? [laughs]

442
00:27:15,101 --> 00:27:16,932
You're like all the other doctors.

443
00:27:17,003 --> 00:27:20,769
Oh, you make him go to a 12-step group,

444
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:24,367
but do you make him stop drinking ?
No ! So I did.

445
00:27:24,444 --> 00:27:29,177
Please. You can't tell David.
This will work.

446
00:27:29,249 --> 00:27:34,186
As David's doctor,
I can't let it happen. I'm sorry.

447
00:27:34,254 --> 00:27:37,018
Then you might as well have me arrested.

448
00:27:37,123 --> 00:27:40,286
Because I don't know how long I've got,

449
00:27:40,393 --> 00:27:43,760
and my family means everything.

450
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:47,061
If I don't protect them, who will ?

451
00:27:50,937 --> 00:27:55,374
[Addison] From birth your baby, your
biological baby... It was difficult.

452
00:27:55,441 --> 00:27:57,170
She had a neurological problem.

453
00:27:57,977 --> 00:27:59,501
She did ?

454
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:02,343
Your C-section caused
severe post labor pain,

455
00:28:02,448 --> 00:28:04,973
so you were sedated
for most of the first two days.

456
00:28:05,051 --> 00:28:08,179
You wouldn't have been aware
of how serious it was.

457
00:28:08,254 --> 00:28:10,484
But you were, Mr. Stinson.

458
00:28:11,491 --> 00:28:15,928
You were in the nursery 24-7. And then
when your daughter was two days old,

459
00:28:15,995 --> 00:28:18,759
she seized while you were holding her.

460
00:28:18,865 --> 00:28:21,356
What are you saying ?
What are you saying ? I'm...

461
00:28:21,434 --> 00:28:24,198
She's saying the next time
you were in the nursery alone,

462
00:28:24,304 --> 00:28:27,865
- is when the babies were switched.
- [Addison] You were the only one there.

463
00:28:27,941 --> 00:28:31,502
It would be easy to switch a
security bracelet 'cause she was small.

464
00:28:31,611 --> 00:28:34,876
- I'm not going to stand for this.
- You were that baby's father !

465
00:28:34,948 --> 00:28:39,715
Mr. Stinson, people's lives
have been altered. Your child's life.

466
00:28:39,819 --> 00:28:43,050
You were supposed to take care of her
and instead switched her

467
00:28:43,122 --> 00:28:44,953
because she was sick.

468
00:28:45,024 --> 00:28:48,391
I think this is your
opportunity to explain to us...

469
00:28:48,494 --> 00:28:50,462
No, you explain.

470
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:52,430
You explain !

471
00:28:52,498 --> 00:28:55,262
Three years and $250,000

472
00:28:55,335 --> 00:28:57,769
and all my wife's hopes and dreams !

473
00:28:58,871 --> 00:29:00,634
- Oh, my God.
- Melinda...

474
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:06,269
...this other family, they can have
more kids, healthy kids. You see ?

475
00:29:06,346 --> 00:29:08,712
[Melinda] Duncan.

476
00:29:11,017 --> 00:29:12,746
[Duncan] This isn't... I'm not a...

477
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,083
Melinda, honey.

478
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:21,485
How could you give my baby
to somebody else ?

479
00:29:22,762 --> 00:29:24,525
How could you ?

480
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:32,730
What switches in your brain
makes it OK to steal a child ?

481
00:29:32,805 --> 00:29:36,138
Adults are there to protect children,
to keep them from harm.

482
00:29:36,209 --> 00:29:37,836
You're angry at yourself.

483
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:41,437
What ? I'm talking about Duncan
Stinson. I'm angry about that.

484
00:29:41,514 --> 00:29:45,780
Right. Before that it was Greg O'Brien.
But it's really about you.

485
00:29:45,852 --> 00:29:49,754
Don't do the shrink thing, Violet.

486
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:55,727
You can't blame yourself for not being
able to make her better, Cooper.

487
00:29:59,532 --> 00:30:00,897
She's just a baby.

488
00:30:08,074 --> 00:30:10,907
We're here because you have
a problem with alcohol.

489
00:30:11,344 --> 00:30:14,006
A problem ? [laughs] No.

490
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,605
- I have a glass of wine or a beer.
- Dave.

491
00:30:16,683 --> 00:30:19,743
Once, twice a week, maybe I drink
more than I should. Tops.

492
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:21,844
We need to get you into treatment.

493
00:30:21,921 --> 00:30:25,687
Why ? Because I like beer ?
Come on. I don't need treatment.

- Dave.
- Sorry.

495
00:30:34,801 --> 00:30:39,295
Well, you should know that I figured out
why you've been getting sick.

496
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:50,340
You've developed an allergy to alcohol.

497
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:53,180
- What ? That's not possible.
- Well, it's rare.

498
00:30:53,286 --> 00:30:56,983
Yeah, it's really rare.
And it probably runs in the family.

499
00:30:57,056 --> 00:31:00,389
So, I mean, you've seen
what happens when you drink.

- That's going to happen every time.
- [Dave] So, what ?

501
00:31:04,597 --> 00:31:09,261
- I have to stop drinking ?
- Yeah, you do. That's my diagnosis.

502
00:31:09,335 --> 00:31:13,704
Now, if you continue to get sick...

503
00:31:13,773 --> 00:31:18,506
...then I'm going to have to consider
that it's something much more serious.
