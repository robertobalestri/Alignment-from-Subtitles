to Allan's message again ?

I have other messages.
From patients.

Those patients ask to pick up
Chinese and say they love you ?

What do you know about women

- I can drive you to school today.

Maya's staying at Sam's.
She asked to stay at Sam's.

31
00:02:04,526 --> 00:02:06,687
- She's growing up.
- I hate her.

- Sam's gonna be late.

- [Violet] He is running an errand.

and talk to you.

40

I don't believe in it.
But Violet says...

41
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:48,032
She thinks I'm not going to heal.
Which is so...

42
00:02:49,571 --> 00:02:52,506
Until I say this thing to you,
I'm not going to move on.

That's what she says. I don't know.

But I'm going to say it.
Just in case she's right.

You were a lousy wife and I hated you.

This is LA. LA is supposed to be full
of swimming pools and movie stars.

52
00:03:39,588 --> 00:03:42,489
LA is the place that you lured me to

53

with your champagne wishes
and caviar dreams.

54
00:03:45,894 --> 00:03:49,330
OK, first of all, you need
to start watching more current TV.

55

Second of all, it's just
a little rain. It'll pass.

It's not about the rain.

57

I mean, it is about the rain,
but I would be fine with the rain

a little more...

what you want. And you have.

I should fight for my right to be happy !

I never thought she'd say yes,
but here she is.

00:06:28,156 --> 00:06:31,023
- Here we are.
- That's wonderful.

Are you all right, Cathleen ?

106
00:06:40,068 --> 00:06:44,334
It's just... on our wedding night, we...

107
00:06:44,406 --> 00:06:46,465
- I couldn't even...
- What ?

108
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:51,539
We've been married for three weeks and
I haven't been able to do it even once.

109
00:06:51,613 --> 00:06:55,845
- Oh, sex. You couldn't...
- She's worried there's something wrong.

110
00:06:55,917 --> 00:06:58,249
There is something wrong with me.

111
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,288
My hoo-ha is broken.

112
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,791

- Like it was a waste of time.

I am good. I am brilliant.

118
00:07:17,505 --> 00:07:20,133
I had a patient trapped
for 19 years in a marriage.

119
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,073
But he's ready to ask for a divorce.

120
00:07:22,143 --> 00:07:24,407
I got him out of his rut.
He's ready to move on.

00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,454
Are you who told my husband to leave me ?

125
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:40,585
- Is this her ? Is this her ?
- Honey.

126
00:07:40,662 --> 00:07:43,563
Did you tell my husband to divorce me ?

127
00:07:43,632 --> 00:07:45,497
You do. You do rule.

128
00:07:47,435 --> 00:07:50,962
I don't mean to be a bother.
I had to bring Erin back. She's so blue.

129
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,098
- It's got to be hard.
- It's terrible.

130
00:07:53,174 --> 00:07:56,405
It's normal for kids
to feel a little down when they're sick.

131
00:07:56,478 --> 00:08:00,005
- It's really nothing to worry about.
- What ? No. She's blue.

132
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:01,207
Understood.

133
00:08:01,282 --> 00:08:02,772
- Light blue.
- OK.

134
00:08:04,085 --> 00:08:05,416
What ?

135
00:08:08,723 --> 00:08:11,487
- Cornflower...
- Blue. Right.

136
00:08:21,736 --> 00:08:25,001
Yeah. That's a pretty nasty bleed.

137
00:08:25,073 --> 00:08:27,837
- Doug, what happened ?
- I'll tell you what happened.

138
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:32,106
Mr. Midlife Crisis came home, dropped
his briefcase in the middle of the floor

139
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,647
and demanded a divorce.

140
00:08:33,715 --> 00:08:36,183
You're not leaving me.
No, sir. You made a vow.

141
00:08:36,251 --> 00:08:39,778
I need you to keep your head tilted,
please, Mrs. Adams.

142
00:08:39,854 --> 00:08:43,790
She got upset about... Then her nose
started bleeding and it wouldn't stop.

143
00:08:43,858 --> 00:08:47,350
You sure she didn't run
into anything... by mistake ?

144
00:08:47,429 --> 00:08:50,398
His mistake was telling me
I've been making his life hell.

145
00:08:50,465 --> 00:08:52,023
I did not say that.

146
00:08:53,468 --> 00:08:55,231
Not exactly.

147
00:08:55,303 --> 00:08:57,828
[Sam] Has your nose ever
spontaneously bled before ?

148
00:08:57,906 --> 00:09:00,841
- What are you thinking ?
- Probably mucosal irritation.

149
00:09:00,909 --> 00:09:03,673
It's not like life with Doug
has been a walk in the park.

150
00:09:03,745 --> 00:09:06,805
- [Sam] Keep your head tilted back.
- I'm doing the best I can !

151
00:09:06,881 --> 00:09:10,977
I think the best thing to do right now
is for everyone to stay calm.

152
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:21,561
Was she exposed to any water
from a well or a spring ?

153
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:22,789
No.

154
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:28,830
- How about antibiotics ?
- Nothing like that.

155
00:09:31,439 --> 00:09:34,101
Quiet for Mommy.
The doctor's thinking.

156
00:09:38,113 --> 00:09:39,273
Dental fillings ?

157
00:09:39,347 --> 00:09:42,373
Yes ! She went to the dentist.
Her first cavity.

158
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:45,942
Dental anesthesia can react
with the hemoglobin in the blood.

159
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,783
I've never seen it, but it happens.

160
00:09:47,889 --> 00:09:49,652
But she's going to be OK ?

161
00:09:49,724 --> 00:09:52,659
I'll give her a IV treatment
of methylene blue.

162
00:09:52,727 --> 00:09:54,388
She'll be nice and pink in no time.

163
00:09:54,462 --> 00:09:56,623
- That should do the trick.
- [Sighs]

164
00:09:57,365 --> 00:09:59,526
Um...

165
00:09:59,634 --> 00:10:02,364
- I got to take a picture.
- You totally do.

166
00:10:03,805 --> 00:10:07,036
Cathleen, I'm gonna ask
some questions about your sex life.

167
00:10:07,108 --> 00:10:10,737
And the more you can tell me about
previous partners, experiences...

168
00:10:10,812 --> 00:10:14,043
[chuckles] Oh, my God.
I don't have any previous experiences.

169
00:10:14,115 --> 00:10:18,552
- I mean, men. Before Geoffrey.
- I'm a virgin, Dr. Montgomery.

170
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,951
Oh.

171
00:10:20,021 --> 00:10:22,319
I know. No one waits this long.
It's weird.

172
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:25,689
Well, it's not weird.
It's just surprising.

173
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,524
I didn't want to give it up
in high school to some geek

174
00:10:28,596 --> 00:10:30,826
in the back of his dad's car, you know ?

175
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:34,562
In college, I kept thinking,
"He's coming. The one."

176
00:10:34,636 --> 00:10:36,968
And I wanted to wait for him.

177
00:10:37,038 --> 00:10:40,906
And then I thought, I've waited
this long, I should hold out.

178
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:44,934
I want it to mean something.
I wanted the fairy tale.

179
00:10:45,013 --> 00:10:48,141
I want it to be special and perfect.
I wanted...

180
00:10:48,216 --> 00:10:49,478
The magic.

181
00:10:51,085 --> 00:10:54,350
Exactly. Some magic.

182
00:10:56,357 --> 00:10:58,518
Let's take a look, OK ?

183
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:04,687
Alrighty.
This is going to be a little cold.

184
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:08,736
Ow !

185
00:11:08,837 --> 00:11:12,204
OK. I know it's a little uncomfortable.
Just try to relax, OK ?

186
00:11:12,273 --> 00:11:14,104
[Laughs] I am relaxed.

187
00:11:16,878 --> 00:11:17,970
Ow !

188
00:11:18,046 --> 00:11:21,743
[Sighs] You've had exams before this ?

189
00:11:21,816 --> 00:11:25,274
Oh, God. It's really broken.
It's broken, isn't it ?

190
00:11:25,353 --> 00:11:27,514
It's not the kind of thing that breaks.

191
00:11:27,622 --> 00:11:30,284
OK. I'm going to go really slow.

192
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:32,590
OK ?

193
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:36,824
Knocking at the door,
stopping in for a little visit.

194
00:11:36,898 --> 00:11:38,866
I'm knocking.

195
00:11:41,436 --> 00:11:45,497
- Knocking a little harder.
- Ow ! Ow, ow, ow !

196
00:11:45,573 --> 00:11:47,803
- [Sighs]
- And I'm done knocking.

197
00:11:47,876 --> 00:11:50,970
- I'm going to die a virgin.
- We're going to figure this out.

198
00:11:51,045 --> 00:11:56,176
Cathleen, we are going to get you
your wedding night. OK ?

199
00:11:56,251 --> 00:11:57,809
Let's do an ultrasound.

200
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:00,547
[ ? Chrisette Michele : <i>Good Girl]</i>

201
00:12:00,622 --> 00:12:02,055
She's 35 and she's never ?

202
00:12:02,123 --> 00:12:07,288
Nope. And the gates are closed.
Locked. Welded shut.

203
00:12:07,395 --> 00:12:10,523
Holding on to your virginity
for that long ? I think it's sad.

204
00:12:10,598 --> 00:12:13,158
It's not sad. It's sweet.

205
00:12:13,234 --> 00:12:16,965
Not being able to have sex with your
husband when you want to, that's sad.

206
00:12:17,038 --> 00:12:18,164
But the waiting ?

207
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:21,504
I mean, what's wrong
with wanting a little magic ?

208
00:12:21,576 --> 00:12:24,511
I lost my virginity when I was 17.
It was not magic.

209
00:12:24,579 --> 00:12:29,482
A lot of friction.
I got rug burns in bad places.

210
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,643
I didn't get the magic until Sam.

211
00:12:32,587 --> 00:12:36,023
I didn't even know
it could be magic until Sam.

212
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,957
I don't remember the last time
I had a little magic.

213
00:12:39,027 --> 00:12:41,928
[Muffled] I hear that. Mm.

214
00:12:43,531 --> 00:12:44,623
- [Laughs]
- What ?

215
00:12:44,699 --> 00:12:47,167
How can you eat that much sugar
in the morning ?

216
00:12:47,235 --> 00:12:49,396
Dell made it. I'm just being polite.

217
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:52,371
What's all this magic talk ?
First LA doesn't have it...

218
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,342
I don't know. The last time I was here
I just felt more...

219
00:12:57,245 --> 00:12:58,803
...magic-y.

220
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,317
- Well, yeah. You kissed Pete.
- I did not kiss Pete.

221
00:13:04,152 --> 00:13:07,383
Pete kissed me.
Which I did not ask for.

222
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,116
I don't even know if he's normal.

223
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:11,852
One minute he's hot,
the next minute he's arctic.

224
00:13:11,926 --> 00:13:15,384
I don't need that kind of damage,
no matter how fancy his lips are.

225
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:26,234
- You're talking about sex, aren't you ?
- We were talking about a patient.

226
00:13:26,841 --> 00:13:30,004
- Who can't have sex.
- Send them my way. I'll get them going.

227
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:33,445
This is a very serious issue.
This is a woman who has needs.

228
00:13:33,514 --> 00:13:37,575
Who has wants.
Who needs and wants magic in her life.

229
00:13:37,652 --> 00:13:42,214
This is not a dirty joke that you can
make your dirty jokes about. Dirty man.

230
00:13:44,258 --> 00:13:46,317
You don't know me at all.

231
00:13:46,394 --> 00:13:49,886
You think you do, but you don't.
So don't call me names.

232
00:13:55,403 --> 00:13:57,462
You should give him a pass this week.

233
00:13:57,538 --> 00:14:01,975
- Why ?
- You just... should.

234
00:14:04,846 --> 00:14:08,782
See what I mean ?
A club. A closed club.

235
00:14:09,984 --> 00:14:12,452
- [Addison sighs]
- [Naomi sighs]

236
00:14:13,921 --> 00:14:17,379
Did you see how upset she was ?

237
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,892
I went back on my vow
and now she's bleeding.

238
00:14:19,961 --> 00:14:21,861
- My words did that.
- No.

239
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:25,763
You don't control anything
except yourself.

240
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,165
You just told her the truth,
what you wanted.

241
00:14:28,236 --> 00:14:30,500
Right.

242
00:14:30,571 --> 00:14:33,699
You're right. So I tell her...

243
00:14:33,775 --> 00:14:37,267
Our work together has not been about
getting you to leave your wife.

244
00:14:37,345 --> 00:14:39,973
It's been about
getting you to say what you want.

245
00:14:40,048 --> 00:14:44,815
- Remember the goal posts, Doug.
- The goal posts.

246
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,985
[Gasps] Right. Right.

247
00:14:49,057 --> 00:14:51,582
[Laughing]

248
00:14:52,827 --> 00:14:55,921
So she lost some iron ? Big deal.

249
00:14:55,997 --> 00:14:58,522
I want a divorce.

250
00:14:59,801 --> 00:15:01,029
Yes, you do.

251
00:15:01,102 --> 00:15:04,071
- Karen, I...
- The bleeding got a lot worse.

252
00:15:04,138 --> 00:15:07,232
I checked her CBC.
Her hematocrit is less than 30.

253
00:15:07,308 --> 00:15:09,538
Less than 30 ? Are you sure ?

254
00:15:10,178 --> 00:15:13,079
- There's something wrong with her ?
- Yes !

255
00:15:13,147 --> 00:15:16,241
You picked a great time
to walk out, Doug. Just great.

256
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,883
It's called vaginismus.

257
00:15:20,955 --> 00:15:26,825
It's a condition that causes a constant,
involuntary muscle spasm.

258
00:15:26,894 --> 00:15:29,260
So you have a way to fix it, right ?
You can fix it ?

259
00:15:29,363 --> 00:15:32,196
Not that I'm not fine
the way things are. I'm fine.

260
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:35,235
I love you and I don't need to have sex
to know that I love you.

261
00:15:35,336 --> 00:15:38,203
- You can fix it ?
- Tell me you can fix it.

262
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:41,901
The ultrasound shows no physical
abnormalities, which is good.

263
00:15:41,976 --> 00:15:45,139
Surprisingly, this sort of thing
is fairly common,

264
00:15:45,213 --> 00:15:47,943
- especially on wedding nights.
- [Laughs]

265
00:15:48,015 --> 00:15:52,281
See, honey ? It's very common,
especially on wedding nights.

266
00:15:53,554 --> 00:15:54,885
So, what do we do ?

267
00:15:54,956 --> 00:16:00,326
Well, I would like to prescribe
a muscle relaxant for you, Cathleen.

268
00:16:00,394 --> 00:16:03,090
- Take it an hour before you...
- [Geoffrey] A pill ! Good.

269
00:16:03,164 --> 00:16:04,791
- A pill.
- I can do a pill.

270
00:16:04,866 --> 00:16:07,528
- And it'll work ?
- There have been case studies.

271
00:16:07,602 --> 00:16:10,162
Just give it your best shot.

272
00:16:16,477 --> 00:16:17,967
[Clears throat]

273
00:16:20,581 --> 00:16:23,948
At home. Give it your best shot at home.

274
00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:26,980
She needs to brush her teeth
before bed.

275
00:16:27,088 --> 00:16:29,318
- OK.
- Don't let her stay up past 9 :00.

276
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,357
OK.

277
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,926
She needs to do her homework
and show it to you.

278
00:16:32,994 --> 00:16:34,723
Do not let her get on the Internet.

279
00:16:34,795 --> 00:16:37,355
You don't have that thing
that blocks predators.

280
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:38,557
Good night, Naomi.

281
00:16:38,633 --> 00:16:41,101
Shuffling Maya back and forth
is not practical.

282
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:43,330
We're gonna be fine.
Maya's gonna be fine.

283
00:16:43,404 --> 00:16:47,033
- You and your head take the night off.
- It's just that she's a girl.

284
00:16:47,108 --> 00:16:49,599
Mothers know more
when it comes to girls !

285
00:16:49,677 --> 00:16:52,646
I'm shutting down for the night.
Unless you need anything ?

286
00:16:52,747 --> 00:16:55,841
No, uh... But, uh, here's... Uh...
Here's your cake carrier.

287
00:16:57,885 --> 00:17:00,115
- You ate the whole thing ?
- We.

288
00:17:00,188 --> 00:17:02,156
[Stammers] I didn't eat a whole cake.

289
00:17:02,256 --> 00:17:05,316
I... I wouldn't. I... I couldn't.

290
00:17:06,394 --> 00:17:09,295
- It was really good.
- Well, I'm glad you liked it.

291
00:17:11,766 --> 00:17:13,996
OK. OK, thank you.

292
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:22,666
[Elevator dings]

293
00:17:23,945 --> 00:17:27,312
- Still raining.
- Yeah. I see that.

294
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:33,487
I made you another one last night.

295
00:17:35,856 --> 00:17:38,518
I... I really shouldn't.

296
00:17:38,593 --> 00:17:41,721
[Whispering] This time
I baked chocolate chips inside.

297
00:17:41,796 --> 00:17:45,254
I can't. [chuckles] Thank you.

298
00:17:46,867 --> 00:17:50,701
You know what ? Maybe someone else
might want it. So, I'll just...

299
00:17:51,472 --> 00:17:52,598
Right.

300
00:17:52,673 --> 00:17:55,039
So the nasal packing
has held overnight.

301
00:17:55,109 --> 00:17:57,077
Looks like the bleeding has stopped.

302
00:17:57,178 --> 00:18:00,113
But I'd like to run a repeat CBC.

303
00:18:00,181 --> 00:18:02,945
We also need to rule out
the serious possibilities.

304
00:18:03,017 --> 00:18:04,951
Serious ? Like what ?

305
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:07,852
Let's not get ahead.
We'll have tests back today.

306
00:18:07,922 --> 00:18:12,086
It's probably benign. In either case,
we are here to support you

307
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:15,686
through the illness and separation,
whatever you need.

308
00:18:15,763 --> 00:18:19,460
I can't believe you're
honestly telling him to leave me. Now.

309
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:22,366
I'm not telling him to...

310
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:24,597
You're not still going ?
This is a crisis.

311
00:18:27,174 --> 00:18:30,803
- Karen doesn't want to live alone.
- What do you want, Doug ?

312
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:37,343
Thank you.
But Doug's coming home with me.

313
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:40,909
He won't be needing therapy anymore.
Will you, Doug ?

314
00:18:40,988 --> 00:18:43,081
No. No, I won't.

315
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:51,428
No sex ! Not even a little sex !

316
00:18:51,499 --> 00:18:54,434
- Really ? [stammering] Really ?
- [Door closes]

317
00:18:54,502 --> 00:18:57,767
- She took the pill, she...
- We tried. Oh, sister, how we tried !

318
00:18:57,838 --> 00:18:59,738
- Honey. It's OK.
- It's not OK.

319
00:18:59,807 --> 00:19:02,275
I need sex ! I need sex, Geoffrey.

320
00:19:02,343 --> 00:19:05,904
I have waited and waited and
I want to do it ! I want to do it now !

321
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,039
You don't need to get upset.

322
00:19:08,115 --> 00:19:11,573
- We have other things to connect us.
- You're a man, Geoffrey.

323
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:14,553
A big, strong, very hot man, which is...

324
00:19:17,224 --> 00:19:19,692
I hit the jackpot with you.

325
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,285
And we want kids. We want a family.

326
00:19:22,363 --> 00:19:25,332
Which is not gonna happen
because you're gonna leave me.

327
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:29,165
I'm not going to leave you.
I don't need sex.

328
00:19:30,604 --> 00:19:32,902
We don't lie to one another.

329
00:19:32,973 --> 00:19:36,306
We never have. Don't start now.

330
00:19:40,181 --> 00:19:42,547
Please, doctor. Please.

331
00:19:46,787 --> 00:19:50,621
[Laughs] Wish you could stop me from...

332
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:54,923
- Hello.
- Still can't get your virgin laid ?

333
00:19:54,995 --> 00:19:57,054
OK.

334
00:19:57,131 --> 00:19:59,224
Nothing I've tried has worked.

335
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,461
I mean, she just can't...

336
00:20:01,535 --> 00:20:04,402
She just can't. And she deserves...

337
00:20:04,472 --> 00:20:07,236
He's her guy. Her one.

338
00:20:07,308 --> 00:20:10,835
- A marriage without sex.
- [Pete] It happens all the time.

339
00:20:12,747 --> 00:20:14,715
Maybe it's psychological.

340
00:20:15,616 --> 00:20:17,379
- Can you see her ?
- Um...

341
00:20:18,452 --> 00:20:20,215
Actually, Pete should see her.

342
00:20:20,321 --> 00:20:21,413
- What ?
- What ?

343
00:20:21,489 --> 00:20:24,822
There are some very good studies
about guided actualization,

344
00:20:24,892 --> 00:20:26,757
- and that's his area.
- That's my area.

345
00:20:26,827 --> 00:20:30,194
Yeah... Eh...

346
00:20:33,601 --> 00:20:34,932
[Naomi] Want some cake ?

347
00:20:39,774 --> 00:20:44,268
Mmm... Sweet mother of chocolate.

348
00:20:44,345 --> 00:20:47,678
- I know.
- You're replacing sex with food.

349
00:20:47,748 --> 00:20:50,080
- [Muffled] Do you want some ?
- [Sighs]

350
00:20:50,151 --> 00:20:52,312
[Naomi] Come on. Come on.

351
00:20:54,088 --> 00:20:56,352
- Oh, man.
- Mm-hmm.

352
00:20:56,424 --> 00:20:57,948
- Mm.
- [Violet laughs]

353
00:21:11,238 --> 00:21:14,571
You see ?
They're getting happy over cake.

354
00:21:14,642 --> 00:21:17,475
I mean, if I could
get happy over cake...

355
00:21:18,379 --> 00:21:20,347
- Well, I wouldn't be a man.
- Exactly.

356
00:21:20,448 --> 00:21:24,214
- The secret to women.
- Like you know the secret to women.

357
00:21:24,285 --> 00:21:26,845
You are a child.
You can barely grow facial hair.

358
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:29,650
- You don't know about women.
- Figure out what they want

359
00:21:29,723 --> 00:21:32,487
- and give it to them.
- Yeah...

360
00:21:32,593 --> 00:21:34,060
Well, that's...

361
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:38,924
- You baked that cake ?
- [Chuckles]

362
00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:42,901
My grandmother baked that cake.
But Naomi doesn't need to know that.

363
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,666
Figure out what they want
and give it to them.

364
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:49,300
- It wasn't the fillings.
- Is Erin OK ? What happened ?

365
00:21:49,376 --> 00:21:52,243
- I don't know. They just got worse.
- Get an exam room.

366
00:21:52,913 --> 00:21:54,278
Do you want just one ?

367
00:22:04,124 --> 00:22:05,853
Here's everything I could find,

368
00:22:05,926 --> 00:22:09,293
and these came from the gyn
she had four years ago.

369
00:22:09,363 --> 00:22:10,728
Thank you.

370
00:22:11,932 --> 00:22:15,561
- Your patient who can't have sex ?
- My patient. Mind your own business.

371
00:22:15,636 --> 00:22:19,197
She's seeing if she can find anything
that's causing the vaginismus.

372
00:22:19,273 --> 00:22:20,831
- He asked.
- He snooped.

373
00:22:20,908 --> 00:22:22,876
- You don't want to try my thing ?
- What ?

374
00:22:22,943 --> 00:22:26,242
To creatively visualize
the parting of the Red Sea ?

375
00:22:26,313 --> 00:22:28,543
A gentle opening of a flower ?

376
00:22:28,616 --> 00:22:31,949
- No, this is medical.
- Maybe I can fix it.

377
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:34,579
Addison, the way we work
around here is with...

378
00:22:34,655 --> 00:22:37,624
- You utilize each other, I got it.
- We take it slow.

379
00:22:37,725 --> 00:22:41,092
Your solution is put her in surgery ?
This woman is not going to die.

380
00:22:41,161 --> 00:22:44,688
If it was you going without,
you'd be begging to go under the knife.

381
00:22:44,765 --> 00:22:47,325
My highly-skilled knife.

382
00:22:47,401 --> 00:22:51,462
I knew it was too much to hope for
a "double board certified surgeon"

383
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:53,973
- not to be the most arrogant...
- Arrogant ?

384
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:57,477
Me ? I am not the one
with a God complex here.

385
00:22:57,545 --> 00:23:02,414
You've got a God and a Buddha complex
all rolled up into one big, arrogant...

386
00:23:02,483 --> 00:23:06,146
I got this. Back off.

387
00:23:10,224 --> 00:23:11,350
Oh, come on.

388
00:23:11,425 --> 00:23:14,986
Naomi is this close to a diabetic coma
thanks to your cake, so...

389
00:23:15,095 --> 00:23:17,859
...you're way worse than I am.
- OK.

390
00:23:20,334 --> 00:23:22,700
Dr. Turner ?

391
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:24,670
- Karen.
- Stay out of my marriage.

392
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:28,105
I think you took care of that.
Doug said he's quitting therapy.

393
00:23:28,175 --> 00:23:31,235
I want to make sure it stays that way.
And if he shows up again...

394
00:23:31,312 --> 00:23:35,214
[cough, clears throat]

395
00:23:35,282 --> 00:23:38,046
I pay the bills.
You won't see a dime.

396
00:23:38,118 --> 00:23:41,087
I don't care about "the dime,"
and even if I did,

397
00:23:41,155 --> 00:23:44,921
why are you fighting for something
that makes you both so miserable ?

398
00:23:44,992 --> 00:23:48,120
You have no idea how my marriage
makes me feel, no idea who I am.

399
00:23:48,195 --> 00:23:53,428
You only have Doug's side of the story.
I'm the bitch and he's... He's...

400
00:23:54,568 --> 00:23:57,036
- I am not on anybody's side.
- Just stay away !

401
00:23:57,104 --> 00:23:58,537
- From...
- Did you ?

402
00:23:58,606 --> 00:24:00,665
[Coughing spasmodically]

403
00:24:02,576 --> 00:24:04,703
Karen ? Karen ?
We need some help !

404
00:24:07,715 --> 00:24:11,151
- [Pete] I hear you got blue girls.
- I ran labs. Nothing's turned up.

405
00:24:11,218 --> 00:24:16,781
It's driving me crazy. I give them IVs,
they turn pink and seem fine, and...

406
00:24:16,857 --> 00:24:18,950
Their mom insisted on taking them home.

407
00:24:19,026 --> 00:24:20,152
Want me to take a look ?

408
00:24:20,227 --> 00:24:23,162
I ordered blood chromatographs.
When those come back.

409
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:26,256
- The mom checked the house for toxins ?
- I gave her the list.

410
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:31,236
She said she's gonna go over it top to
bottom. Which is gonna take a while...

411
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,698
That's time we don't have.
I'm going over there to give her a hand.

412
00:24:38,545 --> 00:24:41,412
[Giggling, chattering]

413
00:24:44,184 --> 00:24:46,914
[Sighs] Yeah, there's...

414
00:24:46,987 --> 00:24:50,616
There's nothing here
from my list of contaminants, and...

415
00:24:50,691 --> 00:24:54,457
And the girls were no place else
today ? No friends' houses, no...

416
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:58,089
They were here all day.
With me. This was my great plan.

417
00:24:58,198 --> 00:25:01,099
I quit my job, fired the nanny.
Because I could do it better.

418
00:25:01,168 --> 00:25:05,867
You've childproofed, you buy organic,
you have biodegradable dryer sheets.

419
00:25:05,939 --> 00:25:07,770
OK, this is not negligence.

420
00:25:08,909 --> 00:25:11,776
Yeah, but
if something happens to them...

421
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:14,473
Their dad travels.
I can't call him up and say...

422
00:25:14,548 --> 00:25:17,073
We're watching.
The IV drug should hold them.

423
00:25:17,151 --> 00:25:21,315
We need to find what's doing this so the
exposure doesn't become more dangerous.

424
00:25:21,388 --> 00:25:24,118
We've gone through the house,
the yard, garage...

425
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:26,159
What do the girls say ?
Where were they ?

426
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,285
They don't talk. Not to me.

427
00:25:28,362 --> 00:25:30,125
Not to anyone over eight.

428
00:25:30,998 --> 00:25:32,522
[Girl] Mommy !

429
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,364
- Erin ?
- [Girl] What's the matter with Erin ?

430
00:25:36,437 --> 00:25:38,200
She's having a seizure.

431
00:25:38,305 --> 00:25:40,136
She'll be OK. She'll be OK.

432
00:25:42,076 --> 00:25:44,806
<i>[Monitor beeping]</i>

433
00:25:50,718 --> 00:25:53,346
I got your test results.

434
00:25:55,589 --> 00:25:58,149
You've got something
called Wegener's disease.

435
00:25:58,258 --> 00:26:00,624
It's a disease of the blood vessels

436
00:26:00,694 --> 00:26:03,629
that affects the ears,
nose, throat and kidneys.

437
00:26:03,697 --> 00:26:07,929
Does she...
Does she die from this ?

438
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:10,265
[Sam] It takes years
to progress to that stage.

439
00:26:10,337 --> 00:26:13,568
With treatment we should be
able to keep it at bay for a long time.

440
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,940
You were lucky. Some bleed out
internally before the disease is caught.

441
00:26:18,946 --> 00:26:22,780
- Lucky.
- I can't believe this.

442
00:26:38,932 --> 00:26:40,456
You should change.

443
00:26:40,534 --> 00:26:44,231
Sam, what would you have done
if it were Naomi ?

444
00:26:44,304 --> 00:26:47,330
If she had gotten sick
right before the divorce ?

445
00:26:47,407 --> 00:26:49,341
I would've stayed.

446
00:26:52,746 --> 00:26:55,647
- Vulvar vestibulitis.
- Shistikinitis.

447
00:26:56,784 --> 00:27:01,949
- I thought we were saying weird stuff.
- My virgin has vulvar vestibulitis.

448
00:27:02,055 --> 00:27:04,023
I went through her medical history.

449
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:07,685
She has inflammation probably caused
by chronic yeast infection

450
00:27:07,795 --> 00:27:11,287
which made her nerve endings
extraordinarily sensitive to pain

451
00:27:11,365 --> 00:27:14,425
which, in turn,
made any attempt to have sex...

452
00:27:14,501 --> 00:27:15,627
Ouch.

453
00:27:15,702 --> 00:27:18,000
That kind of pain
caused her muscles to lock up.

454
00:27:18,071 --> 00:27:22,235
I'm going to do injections of Lidocaine
and steroids in the sensitive areas.

455
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:25,335
- Then you're gonna send her to Pete.
- I can fix this myself.

456
00:27:25,412 --> 00:27:28,643
You fix the vulvar vestibulitis,
Pete can fix the vaginismus.

457
00:27:28,715 --> 00:27:32,242
The two of you will be able
to give this woman a normal sex life.

458
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:35,254
Why is everyone
always pushing Pete on me ?

459
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:38,621
Why are you pushing so hard against him ?
You want to belong here ?

460
00:27:38,692 --> 00:27:40,557
You want to feel part of this place ?

461
00:27:40,627 --> 00:27:43,460
You need to accept
that Pete is part of the solution.

462
00:27:44,965 --> 00:27:47,433
Wisdom coming from a cake fiend.

463
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:50,163
You know, I used to be good at stuff.

464
00:27:50,237 --> 00:27:52,603
I did. I was a good mother,
a good wife.

465
00:27:52,706 --> 00:27:55,573
- I was good at my job.
- You are still...

466
00:27:55,642 --> 00:27:56,802
No. No, I'm not.

467
00:27:56,910 --> 00:28:01,142
And cake... Well,
I just take all these feelings,

468
00:28:01,215 --> 00:28:06,380
the rage, the exhaustion,
the sexual frustration,

469
00:28:06,486 --> 00:28:09,512
the desire to run Sam down with my car,

470
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:13,924
the fact that my child now thinks
that her father is the good parent...

471
00:28:13,994 --> 00:28:17,555
I just take it all and I shove it down
as far as it will go

472
00:28:17,631 --> 00:28:21,533
and then I just put
some food on top of it. A lot of food.

473
00:28:21,602 --> 00:28:27,563
Maybe you should talk to Sam instead
of inhaling 4,000 calories a day.

474
00:28:27,641 --> 00:28:32,374
Look, I do an hour on the treadmill
every single night. I do Pilates.

475
00:28:32,446 --> 00:28:36,405
- I have earned this cake.
- Mmm. Dell cake.

476
00:28:36,483 --> 00:28:37,643
You know what ?

477
00:28:37,751 --> 00:28:40,914
You find your magic your way,
I'll find my magic mine.

478
00:28:40,988 --> 00:28:42,478
[Clears throat]

479
00:28:45,926 --> 00:28:49,259
Violet said that
I should cut Pete some slack.

480
00:28:49,329 --> 00:28:52,821
- Yeah, you should.
- The "why" is what I'm missing.

481
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,396
It's the anniversary
of his wife's death.

482
00:29:01,441 --> 00:29:04,103
- Is this going to hurt ?
- I'm sorry. It is.

483
00:29:04,177 --> 00:29:07,078
OK. OK.

484
00:29:07,147 --> 00:29:09,638
OK. Here we go.

485
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,386
[Whimpers]

486
00:29:13,453 --> 00:29:15,785
- [Gasps] How many more ?
- Four more.

487
00:29:15,856 --> 00:29:19,622
Four more.
I can do four more.

488
00:29:24,197 --> 00:29:26,961
I'm OK. I can do this. [shudders]

489
00:29:27,067 --> 00:29:28,796
- [Sighs]
- This is going to work ?

490
00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:31,429
She's going through this.
It's going to work ?

491
00:29:31,505 --> 00:29:34,269
It will solve the cause
of the vaginismus.

492
00:29:34,374 --> 00:29:36,535
And then I'll get my wedding night ?

493
00:29:45,052 --> 00:29:47,020
[Indistinct chattering]

494
00:29:53,827 --> 00:29:55,385
Just do it. Hey !

495
00:29:55,495 --> 00:29:58,464
I did a little research

496
00:29:58,565 --> 00:30:01,625
and I think my patient
should try your thing.

497
00:30:04,638 --> 00:30:06,162
You want my thing ?

498
00:30:06,239 --> 00:30:10,300
My patient. My patient needs your thing.

499
00:30:11,011 --> 00:30:14,970
What, no comments about my dirty talk ?
Why are you being so nice to me ?

500
00:30:15,082 --> 00:30:16,640
I'm not. I...

501
00:30:18,652 --> 00:30:20,620
Can you help or not ?

502
00:30:21,388 --> 00:30:22,753
I have an opening at 3 :00.

503
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,960
[Sighs]

504
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:36,501
She's toxic. Treatment's going
to have to be a lot more aggressive.

505
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:41,064
- But she'll pull through ?
- [Sighs]

506
00:30:41,708 --> 00:30:45,405
It would help if we knew what
we were dealing with, the contaminant.

507
00:30:49,483 --> 00:30:52,941
Girls. This is very, very serious.

508
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:57,889
Did you eat anything, touch anything
that you're not supposed to ?

509
00:30:57,958 --> 00:31:00,188
Mommy promises not to get mad.

510
00:31:02,429 --> 00:31:05,193
You would really help Erin if you tell.

511
00:31:07,167 --> 00:31:09,135
[Whispering indistinctly]

512
00:31:23,817 --> 00:31:24,943
Sam.

513
00:31:26,053 --> 00:31:28,920
You ordered these antibody studies
for Karen Adams ?

514
00:31:28,989 --> 00:31:30,513
- Room 1001 ?
- I did.

515
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:33,218
As Chief of Staff,
I can't sign off on this.

516
00:31:33,293 --> 00:31:36,956
- These studies are unnecessary.
- I had to confirm a diagnosis.

517
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:39,191
Since when has that been against policy ?

518
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:43,429
Since your patient, this Karen Adams,
was diagnosed with Wegener's disease

519
00:31:43,503 --> 00:31:45,403
at this hospital six months ago.

520
00:31:45,472 --> 00:31:48,703
How is that possible ?
She just started exhibiting symptoms.

521
00:31:48,775 --> 00:31:52,142
That's what she told you.
These records speak for themselves.

522
00:31:56,817 --> 00:31:58,978
[Sighing, murmuring]

523
00:31:59,052 --> 00:32:00,815
She knew.

524
00:32:00,921 --> 00:32:02,889
And she never told her husband.

525
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:12,398
<i>[Allan] Hi, babe. It's me.</i>
<i>I'm gonna be late.</i>

526
00:32:12,466 --> 00:32:17,096
<i>We should pick up some Chinese</i>
<i>and we'll eat in bed, OK ? Love you.</i>

527
00:32:19,139 --> 00:32:20,231
Cake.

528
00:32:21,875 --> 00:32:23,570
With everything he did to you.

529
00:32:23,643 --> 00:32:25,804
He isn't trying to be nervous.

530
00:32:25,879 --> 00:32:29,440
Hey ! Charlotte King just called.
Unnecessary tests on Karen Adams ?

531
00:32:29,516 --> 00:32:33,282
"Hey, Sam. How was your day, Sam ?"
Fine, thanks for asking.

532
00:32:33,353 --> 00:32:36,322
- Naomi ?
- It's called fiscal responsibility.

533
00:32:36,389 --> 00:32:39,290
- We have to pay the bills.
- I've got a patient who's lying

534
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:41,452
about her condition. It's not my fault.

535
00:32:41,528 --> 00:32:44,292
- It is not his fault.
- I was not trying to start a fight.

536
00:32:44,364 --> 00:32:49,097
I'm sorry, but I'm pissed. If we tell
Doug Karen's lying to him, he'd leave.

537
00:32:49,169 --> 00:32:53,037
We can't reveal her medical information
to anyone, including her husband,

538
00:32:53,106 --> 00:32:55,267
without her approval.
Confidentiality.

539
00:32:55,342 --> 00:32:57,173
- She's a patient.
- Your patient.

540
00:32:57,244 --> 00:32:59,974
Your patient is messing
with my patient's happiness.

541
00:33:00,046 --> 00:33:03,982
Three years of kick-ass therapy
down the drain with one swift diagnosis.

542
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:07,076
Maybe they'll work it out.
People do make marriages work.

543
00:33:07,154 --> 00:33:11,591
We're talking serious sacrifice.
She's got him where she wants him.

544
00:33:11,658 --> 00:33:14,923
They won't make it work.
She'll end up hating him.

545
00:33:14,995 --> 00:33:16,690
He'll hate himself for staying.

546
00:33:16,763 --> 00:33:18,924
After she's gone,
that's all he'll have.

547
00:33:19,032 --> 00:33:22,593
So, I think if you can find a way
to help your patient, you do it.

548
00:33:26,239 --> 00:33:29,333
The hospital sent over these results
on Erin Merring.

549
00:33:29,409 --> 00:33:32,071
I don't know how
these girls are getting exposed.

550
00:33:32,145 --> 00:33:35,410
- I can't even get them to talk to me.
- What are they into ?

551
00:33:35,482 --> 00:33:39,145
- Fluffy, pink... pinkness.
- OK, so go there too. Commit.

552
00:33:39,219 --> 00:33:41,847
- Give them what they want.
- Like you and your cake.

553
00:33:41,922 --> 00:33:43,412
They are women, Cooper.

554
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:45,958
- Tiny blue women, but still women.
- [Chuckles]

555
00:33:46,026 --> 00:33:47,152
Yeah... no.

556
00:33:47,227 --> 00:33:51,357
I didn't get in this 'cause I'm a clown.
I'm supposed to play with my patients ?

557
00:33:51,431 --> 00:33:54,594
I put a sticker on my stethoscope,
that's as far as I go.

558
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:59,331
And Erin's lying there getting sicker.

559
00:33:59,406 --> 00:34:01,533
Commit to the cake, man.

560
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:05,037
[Doorbell rings]

561
00:34:07,581 --> 00:34:10,015
Who wants to play ?

562
00:34:13,887 --> 00:34:16,253
- I'm... I'm nervous.
- Me, too.

563
00:34:16,323 --> 00:34:20,885
That's natural.
But Dr. Wilder knows what he's doing.

564
00:34:20,994 --> 00:34:25,761
Hi. Come on in. Make yourselves
comfortable. I'll be right there.

565
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:34,629
Flowers opening, rivers parting.

566
00:34:36,743 --> 00:34:39,507
This is you apologizing to me ?

567
00:34:43,783 --> 00:34:46,809
Well, I got to go give out
the old Pete special.

568
00:34:49,923 --> 00:34:51,254
OK. What ?

569
00:34:52,325 --> 00:34:54,850
- Nothing.
- We banter. It's what we do.

570
00:34:54,928 --> 00:34:56,156
[Sighs]

571
00:34:57,364 --> 00:35:02,927
It's just Naomi told me
what this week is. The anniversary.

572
00:35:04,604 --> 00:35:05,832
It's nothing.

573
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:17,841
- [Cooper] Where exactly are we going ?
- Our secret place !

574
00:35:17,917 --> 00:35:20,886
- Ooh, you have a secret place ?
- We have a magic castle.

575
00:35:20,987 --> 00:35:23,421
But first, we got
to get through the fortress.

576
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:25,458
The fence is the fortress.

577
00:35:25,525 --> 00:35:28,961
[Girls yelling]

578
00:35:29,029 --> 00:35:30,257
[Yells]

579
00:35:43,443 --> 00:35:45,741
- [Girl] Come on. Sit down.
- Ooh !

580
00:35:45,812 --> 00:35:48,940
- Awesome castle.
- Magic castle.

581
00:35:49,015 --> 00:35:51,916
It makes you see stars !

582
00:35:51,985 --> 00:35:53,213
See ?

583
00:35:56,022 --> 00:35:57,990
Wow, stars. Yeah.

584
00:35:58,058 --> 00:35:59,150
Whoa !

585
00:36:01,227 --> 00:36:04,390
[Birds chirping, bells chiming]

586
00:36:04,497 --> 00:36:06,522
The stars make me dizzy.

587
00:36:07,567 --> 00:36:09,865
- Me too !
- Me three !

588
00:36:11,571 --> 00:36:14,335
See the stars ?
How they go all funny ?

589
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:20,236
- [Coughing]
- The stars make you dizzy.

590
00:36:25,885 --> 00:36:27,113
[Girl coughs]

591
00:36:38,398 --> 00:36:43,893
Dr. Bennett.
I told you we don't need a therapist.

592
00:36:45,939 --> 00:36:48,100
You are not my patient.
I am here for Doug.

593
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:51,905
And I'm here for you, Karen.
Now, I have your medical records here.

594
00:36:51,978 --> 00:36:54,742
Would you like for me to
discuss them in front of Doug,

595
00:36:54,848 --> 00:36:57,214
or would you like Doug
to leave the room ?

596
00:36:57,283 --> 00:37:00,946
Because, as your doctor, I cannot
discuss what's in here in front of him

597
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:04,786
- without your permission.
- Why would I have to leave the room ?

598
00:37:04,891 --> 00:37:06,256
Karen ?

599
00:37:08,862 --> 00:37:10,625
This isn't fair. You can't do this.

600
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:12,960
I am not discussing
without your permission.

601
00:37:13,032 --> 00:37:15,193
[Violet] Doug can stay in here
with you and Sam,

602
00:37:15,301 --> 00:37:17,769
or he can come out in the hall
and talk to me.

603
00:37:18,938 --> 00:37:20,462
Karen ?

604
00:37:24,077 --> 00:37:28,036
So I knew I was sick before. So what ?
I didn't think you could take it.

605
00:37:28,114 --> 00:37:30,480
I thought you'd run
like the weakling you are,

606
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:32,141
so I didn't tell you.

607
00:37:32,252 --> 00:37:34,277
You knew you were sick
all this time ?

608
00:37:34,354 --> 00:37:38,586
I thought you were a weak, whiny
pain in the ass, but you surprised me.

609
00:37:38,658 --> 00:37:41,024
It proves that you're not weak,
you're strong.

610
00:37:41,127 --> 00:37:46,497
And I need you. I need your strength.
I want you to stay.

611
00:37:48,968 --> 00:37:50,799
What do you want, Doug ?

612
00:37:52,338 --> 00:37:55,068
You've been coming to see me
for 36 months.

613
00:37:55,141 --> 00:37:58,907
Thirty-six months and
thousands and thousands of dollars.

614
00:38:00,013 --> 00:38:01,776
You came and you worked.

615
00:38:03,016 --> 00:38:05,143
All so you could say what you want.

616
00:38:05,218 --> 00:38:08,483
You've earned yourself
a very expensive backbone.

617
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:12,051
Use it.

618
00:38:14,194 --> 00:38:15,957
What do you want ?

619
00:38:19,299 --> 00:38:21,665
- You promised.
- I'm talking to Doug.

620
00:38:25,205 --> 00:38:27,503
[Scoffs] What I want.

621
00:38:28,575 --> 00:38:30,236
What I want.

622
00:38:35,682 --> 00:38:37,741
I want to stay.

623
00:38:38,785 --> 00:38:41,083
- Doug, you...
- I want to stay ! All right ?

624
00:38:41,154 --> 00:38:44,487
End of discussion.
I'm staying with Karen.

625
00:38:45,558 --> 00:38:47,617
I'm staying with my wife.

626
00:38:54,801 --> 00:38:57,827
- [Elevator door dings]
- [Cathleen] Goodbye. Thanks.

627
00:38:57,904 --> 00:39:01,271
- [Pete] Take care.
- [Addison] Good luck tonight.

628
00:39:01,374 --> 00:39:04,104
- For what it's worth...
- Don't say anything nice.

629
00:39:04,177 --> 00:39:05,542
- I wasn't.
- You were.

630
00:39:05,612 --> 00:39:07,739
I don't need pity.
I don't need sympathy.

631
00:39:07,814 --> 00:39:09,304
I was going to say,

632
00:39:09,382 --> 00:39:13,716
whatever you did in there,
for Cathleen, I hope it works.

633
00:39:13,786 --> 00:39:16,050
They deserve to have a perfect night.

634
00:39:16,756 --> 00:39:18,621
Oh.

635
00:39:19,192 --> 00:39:20,750
I get a little...

636
00:39:21,761 --> 00:39:23,854
[stammers] I need...

637
00:39:26,299 --> 00:39:28,563
I'm a little lost here.

638
00:39:32,005 --> 00:39:36,305
My wife went to sleep beside me in bed
on a Tuesday night.

639
00:39:36,376 --> 00:39:40,745
On Wednesday morning, I woke up
and she was dead. It's one bad night.

640
00:39:40,847 --> 00:39:42,542
But...

641
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:48,282
...all our nights were bad.

642
00:39:49,289 --> 00:39:51,348
And we never had a perfect night.

643
00:39:53,493 --> 00:39:55,927
Not even our wedding night.

644
00:39:58,064 --> 00:39:59,793
Nothing's perfect.

645
00:40:01,134 --> 00:40:02,897
Nothing's ever perfect.

646
00:40:12,211 --> 00:40:15,180
That's the most he's ever
told anybody about his wife.

647
00:40:24,457 --> 00:40:29,121
The "castle" in your neighbor's yard
was full of toxic fumes

648
00:40:29,195 --> 00:40:31,254
from open bags of fertilizer.

649
00:40:31,331 --> 00:40:35,358
- That's what made them sick ?
- They were inhaling ammonium nitrate.

650
00:40:35,435 --> 00:40:38,871
First it turned them blue, then
it attacked their nervous systems.

651
00:40:39,505 --> 00:40:42,736
They play in the yard. I never thought
they'd get beyond the fence.

652
00:40:42,809 --> 00:40:46,301
Well, you know,
they kind of kick ass, so...

653
00:40:46,379 --> 00:40:50,941
- [laughs]
- Mom ? Can they sit in my bed ?

654
00:40:52,585 --> 00:40:54,450
Be gentle, OK ?

655
00:41:03,296 --> 00:41:04,820
[All whispering]

656
00:41:11,371 --> 00:41:13,202
- [Knock on door]
- [Door opens]

657
00:41:13,706 --> 00:41:17,039
[Sighs] I'm sorry.

658
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:20,440
[Stammers] I know how much you cared.

659
00:41:20,513 --> 00:41:24,005
- How hard you worked.
- You worked.

660
00:41:24,083 --> 00:41:26,017
You did most of it.

661
00:41:26,085 --> 00:41:29,646
I may not be in love with her,
but I owe her.

662
00:41:29,756 --> 00:41:32,623
No one should go through
what she's going through alone.

663
00:41:32,692 --> 00:41:34,956
- She doesn't have to be...
- I wanted to say,

664
00:41:35,028 --> 00:41:36,962
I still think we did something here.

665
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:40,466
I mean, before I met you,
things just happened to me.

666
00:41:40,533 --> 00:41:42,296
I made a choice today.

667
00:41:42,402 --> 00:41:45,963
But you're still picking what's safe,
what's familiar.

668
00:41:46,072 --> 00:41:48,768
Pain that won't even make her better.

669
00:41:48,841 --> 00:41:51,605
- What about what...
- What I want ?

670
00:41:51,711 --> 00:41:56,080
Is for you to be the therapist and me
to be the patient. It's my life.

671
00:41:56,182 --> 00:42:00,084
At least now I know
I've made my bed, nobody else.

672
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:06,754
You're right. It's your choice.

673
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,853
And you made it.

674
00:42:11,164 --> 00:42:14,622
- And that is something.
- Thanks.

676
00:42:31,984 --> 00:42:33,815
- It's not raining.
- Yeah.

677
00:42:33,886 --> 00:42:36,116
- Yippee.
- I'm starting to agree with you.

678
00:42:36,756 --> 00:42:38,314
- About the magic.
- Thank you.

679
00:42:38,391 --> 00:42:40,552
That... That's... Thank you.

680
00:42:40,626 --> 00:42:43,151
- OK. So just call me tonight, OK ?
- Mom.

681
00:42:43,229 --> 00:42:45,697
Will you just call me, OK ?

682
00:42:45,765 --> 00:42:48,063
- Will you make sure she calls me ?
- OK.

683
00:42:49,969 --> 00:42:51,436
Quiet down in there.

Double fudge with chocolate frosting.

685

You know what ?
Enough with the cake.

686
00:43:05,318 --> 00:43:07,786
I don't want your cake.
I don't need your cake.

687
00:43:07,854 --> 00:43:10,414
I didn't ask for your cake !
I'm all caked out !

688
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:13,254
You know whose cake I want ?
I want Sam's cake !

689
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:15,793
But Sam's not baking a cake for me !
Could you...

690
00:43:15,862 --> 00:43:17,295
Nai.

691
00:43:18,631 --> 00:43:21,896
Dell, she's going
off sugar for a while.

692
00:43:21,968 --> 00:43:24,232
I'm not gonna stop bringing you cake.

693
00:43:24,303 --> 00:43:26,032
- You !
- All right, Dell !

694
00:43:26,105 --> 00:43:28,972
- No more cake !
- This isn't "Maya likes Sam better."

695
00:43:29,041 --> 00:43:33,569
You're mad at me for bringing you here.
And this boy is baking cakes at me !

696
00:43:33,646 --> 00:43:35,477
We're going to get through this.

697
00:43:35,548 --> 00:43:36,810
- Yeah, we are ?
- Yes.

698
00:43:36,883 --> 00:43:38,612
We're all gonna get through this.

699
00:43:38,684 --> 00:43:42,051
- That's why you have us.
- We're gonna get through this together.

700
00:43:42,121 --> 00:43:44,555
Just when is something good
going to happen ?

701
00:43:44,624 --> 00:43:46,956
- When is there gonna be a little...
- Magic ?

702
00:43:47,026 --> 00:43:49,551
Yeah, that's the unending question.

[ ? Matthew Perryman Jones : <i>Save You]</i>

[Sighs] You drank all the orange juice.

705
00:44:07,914 --> 00:44:09,575
You hogged the covers.

706
00:44:09,649 --> 00:44:11,617
You put our dog to sleep.

707
00:44:13,586 --> 00:44:15,281
You never took my side.

708
00:44:16,222 --> 00:44:17,553
You were mean to me.

709
00:44:17,623 --> 00:44:19,989
You withheld sex ! You were cold !

710
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,828
