[ ? The Brand New Heavies :
<i>How We Do This]</i>

2
00:00:08,744 --> 00:00:10,473
- Morning, neighbor.
- Hey.

3
00:00:10,545 --> 00:00:12,513
You look fancy.

4
00:00:12,581 --> 00:00:15,812
I have to be on live TV this morning.

5
00:00:15,884 --> 00:00:19,650
I thought maybe you were dressed
for something later. A special event.

6
00:00:19,755 --> 00:00:21,985
I've never been on live TV.

7
00:00:22,057 --> 00:00:24,389
It's more of a get-together
than an event.

8
00:00:24,459 --> 00:00:27,292
I had a dream.
I was on camera and I was talking

9
00:00:27,362 --> 00:00:30,195
and all of my teeth fell out.

10
00:00:30,265 --> 00:00:34,759
OK, why has nobody, including you,
responded to my invitation tonight ?

11
00:00:34,836 --> 00:00:38,863
I've invited everyone from work
to my home over a week ago. A week.

12
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,636
Addison, I live three feet away
from your new home.

13
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,736
If you have a party, I'll be there
even if I don't want to be.

14
00:00:44,813 --> 00:00:48,579
- What a delightful acceptance.
- I have to be on live TV.

15
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,016
You want me to come with you ?
Moral support ?

16
00:00:51,086 --> 00:00:52,747
Yes. Yes.

17
00:00:52,821 --> 00:00:55,517
Well, all you have to do is invite me.

18
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,081
- I would like you to come.
- And I RSVP yes.

19
00:00:59,127 --> 00:01:01,425
Like any decent person would.

20
00:01:02,697 --> 00:01:04,528
Hey ! Hands out of the mouth.

21
00:01:07,936 --> 00:01:10,496
Now, you've been sick a lot
this year, right ?

22
00:01:10,572 --> 00:01:13,598
Now my exam didn't
turn up anything, medically.

23
00:01:13,675 --> 00:01:17,202
Now what else has changed this year ?
Job, home ?

24
00:01:17,279 --> 00:01:20,737
- I'm going bald.
- [Audience laughs]

25
00:01:20,816 --> 00:01:25,344
OK. See, now this is what
I'm talking about in my book.

26
00:01:25,854 --> 00:01:28,152
The whole mindlbody connection.

27
00:01:28,223 --> 00:01:30,657
Now your body is trying to talk to you.

28
00:01:30,725 --> 00:01:35,059
Trying to get you to pay attention
with what's going on up here.

29
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,066
Now hair loss or no, it's the head
that's messing with the machine.

30
00:01:39,134 --> 00:01:43,002
You think the ladies are lining up
to choose me over some guy with hair ?

31
00:01:43,805 --> 00:01:46,273
Louis, my man. Look at my head.

32
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:49,776
Bald is beautiful. Bald is sexy.

33
00:01:49,845 --> 00:01:51,608
- Virile men are bald.
- [Applause]

34
00:01:52,214 --> 00:01:54,273
The Arm & Hammer guy is bald.

35
00:01:55,517 --> 00:01:57,883
Louis, you're a bald man.

36
00:01:57,986 --> 00:02:00,614
- Come on. Say it.
- I'm a bald man.

37
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:05,422
- You are a strong, proud bald man.
- I'm a strong, proud bald m...

38
00:02:05,494 --> 00:02:09,863
- You are a strong, proud bald man !
- I am a strong, proud bald...

39
00:02:09,965 --> 00:02:12,832
One more time with fervor.
You are a strong, proud...

40
00:02:12,901 --> 00:02:14,926
I am a strong, proud bald man !

41
00:02:15,003 --> 00:02:18,461
Yes ! That's what I'm talking about !
Bald is beautiful.

42
00:02:24,846 --> 00:02:26,404
- How was the TV thing ?
- [Grunts]

43
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:29,780
- He was very inspiring.
- I'm a fraud.

44
00:02:29,851 --> 00:02:34,515
You were inspiring. Listening to
the patient, the mindlbody connection...

45
00:02:34,589 --> 00:02:36,614
You inspired me, OK ? Yeah.

46
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:38,659
Wasn't he inspiring on TV ?

47
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,921
The Arm & Hammer guy's
not bald by the way.

48
00:02:40,996 --> 00:02:44,864
- He is too. He's bald.
- Arm & Hammer guy definitely not bald.

49
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:46,491
- Yeah.
- [Addison] Everybody ?

50
00:02:46,568 --> 00:02:48,195
Mr. Clean's bald.

51
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,831
Hey, guys, I'm just trying
to get a head count for tonight.

52
00:02:52,807 --> 00:02:54,900
- What's tonight ?
- My party.

53
00:02:57,212 --> 00:03:00,511
- Is anybody coming ?
- Oops.

54
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:02,573
- I forgot.
- Yeah.

55
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:06,712
- I made plans to...
- I'm there. I RSVP'd.

56
00:03:07,455 --> 00:03:10,686
Hey. I'm sorry I'm late.
The Arm & Hammer guy's not bald.

57
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:13,125
I know. He's just an arm.

58
00:03:13,228 --> 00:03:15,389
And a hammer.

59
00:03:17,933 --> 00:03:19,491
OK. Today's cases ?

60
00:03:26,808 --> 00:03:29,368
- What's this ?
- Naomi's wall of miracles.

61
00:03:29,477 --> 00:03:31,843
This one here is my favorite, Jamie.

62
00:03:32,814 --> 00:03:34,782
The mother had hardly any eggs left.

63
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:37,784
You know, borderline FSH.
She had given up.

64
00:03:37,852 --> 00:03:43,313
But Naomi did her thing and pow.

65
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:46,625
I mean, she made every baby up there.

66
00:03:46,695 --> 00:03:48,458
I mean, she helped.

67
00:03:50,131 --> 00:03:52,622
Those are her miracles.

68
00:03:58,607 --> 00:04:00,541
Miracles.

69
00:04:01,643 --> 00:04:04,510
Wow. It's a beaut.

70
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:08,208
My first husband thought
engagement rings were too extravagant.

71
00:04:08,283 --> 00:04:11,912
So this is my one and only.
And this is him. This is my Stan.

72
00:04:11,987 --> 00:04:15,445
You should get back out there, Pete.
Find yourself a Stan.

73
00:04:16,324 --> 00:04:17,757
I'm out there.

74
00:04:17,826 --> 00:04:21,284
I'm not talking about the girls
you date. I'm talking about love.

75
00:04:21,363 --> 00:04:24,890
I'm talking about marriage.
Soul mates. Like us.

76
00:04:24,966 --> 00:04:28,527
- You worry too much, Sylvie.
- Stan's been falling asleep.

77
00:04:29,304 --> 00:04:32,671
- Falling asleep ?
- Tell the doctor, Stan.

78
00:04:32,741 --> 00:04:34,902
Sometimes I just go to sleep.

79
00:04:34,976 --> 00:04:36,739
[Sylvie] When I'm talking to him.

80
00:04:36,811 --> 00:04:40,178
In the middle of the day.
First time I thought he was dead.

81
00:04:40,248 --> 00:04:43,479
I always wake up in a couple of seconds.
It's no big deal.

82
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:47,817
But Sylvie has to go and drag me
to see the whacko doctor.

83
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:51,916
Stan ! He's a little more traditional
than I am, but he'll warm to you.

84
00:04:51,993 --> 00:04:55,360
Before you fall asleep
do you have dizziness or palpitations ?

85
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,797
- This is a waste of time.
- No. When he wakes up, he's good.

86
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,528
It's almost like it never happened.
You think...

87
00:05:03,204 --> 00:05:04,899
There he goes.

88
00:05:08,743 --> 00:05:10,210
- Come on.
- [Both] Aah...

89
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,509
No signs of infection.

90
00:05:14,616 --> 00:05:17,141
- You got a little swelling.
- What does that mean ?

91
00:05:17,218 --> 00:05:20,984
Combined with the lack of energy
and appetite, it could be mononucleosis.

92
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:22,647
Wait. The kissing disease ?

93
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:26,627
- Have you been kissing someone ?
- Gross. No.

94
00:05:26,728 --> 00:05:29,856
OK, there are plenty of other ways
to contract mono.

95
00:05:29,931 --> 00:05:31,956
I'll have to take some blood
to find out.

96
00:05:32,033 --> 00:05:34,729
- But I can still skateboard, right ?
- No.

97
00:05:34,803 --> 00:05:38,967
Not until you're better.
Until then, you get plenty of sleep.

98
00:05:40,008 --> 00:05:41,441
And no making out.

99
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:43,943
Like anybody would
want to kiss me anyway.

100
00:05:51,386 --> 00:05:53,547
I don't have a lot of domain
around here.

101
00:05:55,323 --> 00:06:00,090
- I'm stepping on your domain.
- Little bit. Can I help ?

102
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:04,687
I need me. The me file.

103
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,764
I... I would be one of Naomi's patients.

104
00:06:10,105 --> 00:06:11,970
Oh, OK. Yeah.

105
00:06:12,874 --> 00:06:14,034
Is everything OK ?

106
00:06:15,844 --> 00:06:18,005
- Lady problems ?
- Just give me the file.

107
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:20,047
Because I might be able to help.

108
00:06:20,648 --> 00:06:23,344
I'm, like, the hub,
in the Oceanside wheel.

109
00:06:23,418 --> 00:06:25,443
The file, Dell.

110
00:06:26,121 --> 00:06:27,281
OK.

111
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:39,758
Are you going to this Addison thing ?

112
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:42,635
- I'll go if you go ?
- You know what ?

113
00:06:42,704 --> 00:06:45,537
There comes a point
when you're done with new people.

114
00:06:45,607 --> 00:06:48,235
- Do I really need a new friend ?
- Not with me around.

115
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:51,073
I'm a lot of friend.
I'm two double patties of friend.

116
00:06:51,146 --> 00:06:53,842
- That's what I'm saying.
- That's what I'm saying.

117
00:06:53,915 --> 00:06:55,576
What ? What are we hiding from ?

118
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,948
- It's Cami.
- Cami ?

119
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:01,386
- The woman Allan dumped you for, Cami ?
- He didn't dump me.

120
00:07:01,456 --> 00:07:05,017
He just married her
right after he left me.

121
00:07:05,093 --> 00:07:07,323
What the hell is she doing with Naomi ?

122
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:10,290
Cami Davis is a patient here ?

123
00:07:10,865 --> 00:07:13,732
- You should ask Naomi.
- What is Cami Davis here for ?

124
00:07:13,802 --> 00:07:16,236
- You should ask Naomi.
- Fine. I will.

125
00:07:16,304 --> 00:07:17,669
OK, freak show ?

126
00:07:21,476 --> 00:07:24,843
Oh, my God. I'm pathetic.
I need to let this go.

127
00:07:25,847 --> 00:07:30,216
- I'm gonna let this go.
- [Both inhale and exhale deeply]

128
00:07:30,952 --> 00:07:33,420
- Who cares why Cami is here ?
- Yeah.

129
00:07:34,022 --> 00:07:36,456
[Mouthing]

130
00:07:36,524 --> 00:07:39,186
- Hey.
- You find what you were looking for ?

131
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,818
Kind of.

132
00:07:40,929 --> 00:07:43,830
Did I mention I'm a total whiz
at the female anatomy ?

133
00:07:43,898 --> 00:07:46,799
I'm acing my midwifery classes.

134
00:07:46,868 --> 00:07:50,634
- I got it all up here.
- Yeah, yeah. Keep it up there.

135
00:07:50,738 --> 00:07:53,002
Vulva !

136
00:07:53,074 --> 00:07:54,439
Labium majus !

137
00:07:55,443 --> 00:07:59,777
If that's flirting, you need new skills.
Could you run these labs for me ?

138
00:07:59,848 --> 00:08:01,372
[Elevator dings]

139
00:08:03,451 --> 00:08:06,147
Dr. Bennett. Dr. Sam Bennett ?

140
00:08:06,221 --> 00:08:08,951
- I'm Dr. Bennett. Whoa ! OK.
- Let's get you to a chair.

141
00:08:09,023 --> 00:08:10,786
- Right over here.
- [Addison] Easy.

142
00:08:10,859 --> 00:08:12,326
Have a seat. Nice and slow.

143
00:08:12,393 --> 00:08:14,122
There we... Whoa.

144
00:08:15,897 --> 00:08:18,457
Did you just walk
right out of the hospital ?

145
00:08:18,566 --> 00:08:21,433
- We had to get out of there.
- We ? You and ?

146
00:08:22,704 --> 00:08:24,001
Me and my baby.

147
00:08:26,241 --> 00:08:28,175
They were trying to kill us.

148
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:37,512
I saw you on TV.

149
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:41,746
Those things you said,
about listening to the patient,

150
00:08:41,823 --> 00:08:43,051
was that just TV crap ?

151
00:08:43,124 --> 00:08:45,490
No, I meant it.

152
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,790
Except for the Arm & Hammer part.

153
00:08:47,862 --> 00:08:50,228
So you said
the hospital is trying to kill you ?

154
00:08:50,298 --> 00:08:53,028
Everything they do just makes me sicker.

155
00:08:53,101 --> 00:08:55,262
- How far along are you ?
- Five months.

156
00:08:56,771 --> 00:08:59,239
I know I look thin,
but I'm eating, I am.

157
00:08:59,307 --> 00:09:01,673
I've always had stomach stuff,
this pain.

158
00:09:01,743 --> 00:09:04,211
But nobody can figure out what's wrong.

159
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:08,045
I'm doing what you said, listening
to my body, but nobody believes me.

160
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:10,709
Why don't you give me
your name and your hospital ?

161
00:09:10,818 --> 00:09:13,286
- I'll talk to your doctor.
- I can't.

162
00:09:13,354 --> 00:09:15,322
I can't give you that.

163
00:09:17,091 --> 00:09:19,924
You scratched your name
off your hospital bracelet ?

164
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,491
She won't give us
any of her information.

165
00:09:24,599 --> 00:09:27,500
- She's afraid we'll send her back.
- You're damn right.

166
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:31,060
- I'll get Dell to call the hospitals.
- She came here because of Sam.

167
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:33,300
She was inspired by Dr. Sam.

168
00:09:33,408 --> 00:09:37,242
Well, then she's going to want
to go back because Dr. Sam is an idiot.

169
00:09:37,312 --> 00:09:39,542
I'd like to run some tests.

170
00:09:39,614 --> 00:09:42,742
OK, fine. But just until we figure out
where she belongs.

171
00:09:42,817 --> 00:09:46,776
- You had to go on TV.
- Thank you, Sam.

172
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:51,884
- Does she seem a little...
- Did you RSVP to her thing ?

173
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,723
- Oh...
- Yeah.

174
00:09:53,828 --> 00:09:56,194
Damn floor got off balance.

175
00:09:56,297 --> 00:09:58,458
Were you dizzy
right before it happened ?

176
00:09:58,566 --> 00:10:00,295
Maybe a little.

177
00:10:00,368 --> 00:10:03,701
What's happening to him ?
Is he gonna have to go to the hospital ?

178
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:06,137
Stan, I'd like to run some basic tests.

179
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,869
We'll get an EKG, an MRI.
Let's see if we find anything.

180
00:10:15,249 --> 00:10:18,013
You fix Stan. Hear me ?

181
00:10:18,086 --> 00:10:20,316
Like I said, he's my one and only.

182
00:10:22,323 --> 00:10:25,815
Hey. I got a 70-year-old male
presenting with syncope.

183
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:27,258
These what you'd run ?

184
00:10:27,328 --> 00:10:30,195
OK. He's hypertensive, diabetic.

185
00:10:30,264 --> 00:10:33,028
Could be a TIA or an occult arrhythmia.

186
00:10:33,101 --> 00:10:34,398
I hope not.

187
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,731
- OK. Thanks.
- Yeah.

188
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,171
You should RSVP for Addison's thing.

189
00:10:40,241 --> 00:10:42,175
She's starting to get squirrelly.

190
00:10:42,243 --> 00:10:44,143
Yeah, I'm not sure.

191
00:10:45,013 --> 00:10:47,504
- She's getting to you.
- She is not.

192
00:10:49,017 --> 00:10:50,917
I'm not going there.

193
00:10:52,286 --> 00:10:54,447
She's definitely getting to you !

194
00:10:54,555 --> 00:10:56,113
So, he doesn't have mono ?

195
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:59,956
- Test came back negative.
- Oh, thank God. I'm going to call Dad.

196
00:11:02,597 --> 00:11:05,964
You don't seem happy. You were hoping
for a contagious disease ?

197
00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:10,197
I knew I didn't have it.
I know what's wrong with me.

198
00:11:10,271 --> 00:11:13,502
- What's that ?
- I'm in love.

199
00:11:14,776 --> 00:11:17,301
Is that awful ?
That's great, right ?

200
00:11:17,378 --> 00:11:20,711
Not when the person you're in love with
doesn't like you back.

201
00:11:20,782 --> 00:11:23,808
- Who is she ?
- Someone at the skate park.

202
00:11:23,885 --> 00:11:26,854
- Does she know you like her ?
- No.

203
00:11:26,921 --> 00:11:28,855
If I tell, it'll change everything.

204
00:11:28,923 --> 00:11:29,981
[ ? Thief : <i>Sunchild]</i>

205
00:11:30,058 --> 00:11:32,583
I don't know, man.
Don't you gotta go for it ?

206
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:35,220
Ask her to do something
or hang out or...

207
00:11:35,296 --> 00:11:38,322
I thought about it,
but I don't want to mess everything up.

208
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,664
I'm not saying it's going to be easy.
I mean, I know. I've...

209
00:11:41,736 --> 00:11:43,601
- I got to...
- What ?

210
00:11:45,506 --> 00:11:46,632
This girl I like,

211
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:50,837
I've been trying to get up the nerve
to say something for a long time.

212
00:11:50,912 --> 00:11:52,641
I mean a long time.

213
00:11:53,414 --> 00:11:55,245
- For real ?
- Yeah.

214
00:11:57,819 --> 00:12:00,583
I'll tell you what, a pact.

215
00:12:00,655 --> 00:12:04,785
I'll do it if you do it.
Let's spill our guts, see what happens.

216
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:11,057
- Pact.
- Boom.

217
00:12:22,977 --> 00:12:25,741
- Violet ?
- Why is Cami Davis here ?

218
00:12:25,813 --> 00:12:27,713
- Why was she seeing you ?
- Violet.

219
00:12:27,782 --> 00:12:30,751
I know. But why was she here ?

220
00:12:30,852 --> 00:12:33,821
- Do you really want to know ?
- OK, don't tell me.

221
00:12:33,888 --> 00:12:36,049
I will tell you
if you really want to know.

222
00:12:36,157 --> 00:12:39,422
No. No matter what I say.
No matter what I do.

223
00:12:39,494 --> 00:12:42,122
Don't tell me.
Because it's not smart.

224
00:12:42,196 --> 00:12:45,962
And it's unhealthy
and I should mind my own business.

225
00:12:46,067 --> 00:12:48,331
- Swear you won't tell me.
- I swear.

226
00:12:48,402 --> 00:12:50,165
OK.

227
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,113
Are you OK ?

228
00:13:02,183 --> 00:13:06,142
What if Stan doesn't
really want to marry me ?

229
00:13:06,254 --> 00:13:08,415
- Why would you think that ?
- Hear me out.

230
00:13:08,489 --> 00:13:11,253
These "attacks,"
what if they're caused by stress

231
00:13:11,325 --> 00:13:13,293
about getting hitched to me for life ?

232
00:13:13,394 --> 00:13:15,919
Sylvie, there are a lot
of possible reasons.

233
00:13:15,997 --> 00:13:18,830
They started right after he proposed.

234
00:13:21,002 --> 00:13:23,061
Hey. I just checked on our Jane Doe.

235
00:13:23,137 --> 00:13:25,002
Why are you checking on my patient ?

236
00:13:25,072 --> 00:13:28,439
- This is not midwiff school.
- She's having contractions.

237
00:13:28,543 --> 00:13:30,670
[Groaning] Is the baby OK ?

238
00:13:30,745 --> 00:13:33,908
The medication I'm giving you
will stop the contractions.

239
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:35,608
Just focus on your breathing.

240
00:13:35,683 --> 00:13:38,379
OK. Breathing.

241
00:13:39,353 --> 00:13:40,718
Here we go.

242
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:45,024
The fetal weight is low for five months.

243
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:47,026
But...

244
00:13:47,094 --> 00:13:51,656
...the heartbeat is present and strong.

245
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:56,203
- For now.
- Nobody thought I could get pregnant.

246
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,636
Not my doctors, my boyfriend.

247
00:13:58,706 --> 00:14:02,005
My body's been messed up my whole life.

248
00:14:02,076 --> 00:14:05,603
This baby ? It's a miracle.

249
00:14:08,783 --> 00:14:10,410
Total cliché, right ?

250
00:14:11,586 --> 00:14:14,851
No. No, I get it.

251
00:14:16,691 --> 00:14:18,716
I'll do whatever you say.

252
00:14:20,261 --> 00:14:22,729
I can't lose my baby.

253
00:14:23,898 --> 00:14:27,197
- I hear you have something of ours.
- [Naomi] She came here on her own.

254
00:14:27,268 --> 00:14:30,795
We called every hospital in the city
to find out where she came from.

255
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:32,998
- You know our Jane Doe ?
- Rebecca Hobart.

256
00:14:33,074 --> 00:14:36,305
I'm going to arrange transportation
back to Saint Ambrose.

257
00:14:36,377 --> 00:14:39,710
Rebecca wants to stay here.
We are keeping her.

258
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:42,874
Is that so ? I think your guest
left out more than her name.

259
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:46,078
- What do you mean ?
- Rebecca Hobart's a 51 l50.

260
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:48,417
- She's on involuntary hold ?
- That's right.

261
00:14:48,489 --> 00:14:52,755
The patient you are aiding and abetting ?
She's straight out of the psych ward.

262
00:14:58,566 --> 00:15:01,262
She doesn't seem crazy to me.

263
00:15:01,335 --> 00:15:03,269
She's very convincing.

264
00:15:03,337 --> 00:15:06,306
- Like all good Münchausen patients.
- Wait. Münchausen ?

265
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:09,035
She's making herself sick
for the attention ?

266
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,271
In and out of psych wards
since she was 18.

267
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:14,610
Joint pain, stomach problems,
all kinds of vague symptoms,

268
00:15:14,682 --> 00:15:16,377
but her tests don't back her up.

269
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:20,079
- But she wants to be treated here.
- Her mother is her medical guardian.

270
00:15:20,154 --> 00:15:24,386
Under state law, if her mother wants her
back at the hospital, Rebecca goes back.

271
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,358
Agreed. She goes.

272
00:15:27,528 --> 00:15:29,223
She's having contractions.

273
00:15:29,297 --> 00:15:32,266
You want to move her now,
make her lose the baby ? Be my guest.

274
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,769
Why would you light a fire
under Charlotte King's ass for a 51 l50 ?

275
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,536
- I ought to 51 l50 your skinny...
- Rebecca is not...

276
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,510
Have you talked to her ? I believe her.

277
00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:48,275
Münchausen. These people are
exceptional, spectacular liars.

278
00:15:48,349 --> 00:15:51,182
- Take it down a notch.
- People get angry. It's normal.

279
00:15:51,252 --> 00:15:53,948
- Sam is trying to help.
- Sam doesn't like conflict.

280
00:15:54,021 --> 00:15:55,579
Whoa, ladies. Off topic.

281
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:02,020
I think Violet should do
a psych eval on Rebecca.

282
00:16:02,096 --> 00:16:06,465
- The woman has a long history...
- Sam, do you agree with me ?

283
00:16:07,168 --> 00:16:09,295
Your next patient is in room two.

284
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:12,601
- Bless you, Dell.
- Addison. Addison.

285
00:16:13,341 --> 00:16:15,707
Why are you fighting so hard
for this woman ?

286
00:16:15,776 --> 00:16:17,869
Since when do you give up on people ?

287
00:16:17,945 --> 00:16:20,778
- I'm just trying to look out for you.
- Well, don't.

288
00:16:22,817 --> 00:16:25,650
Hey, Addison. I'm coming. OK ?

289
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,087
Don't tell me this is because
I forgot to RSVP to your party.

290
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,556
Can I ask Violet
to do the psych eval or not ?

291
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:34,885
Fine.

292
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:42,328
I don't need a shrink. This is why
I didn't tell you about the psych ward.

293
00:16:42,403 --> 00:16:45,566
I need you to be off your feet.
Your contractions just eased up.

294
00:16:45,673 --> 00:16:49,609
If no one can figure out what's wrong
with me, they'll keep saying I'm crazy.

295
00:16:49,677 --> 00:16:51,167
They'll take my baby away.

296
00:16:51,245 --> 00:16:54,271
We'll do everything we can
to keep that from happening.

297
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:56,407
But we need you to help us.
Now come on.

298
00:16:56,484 --> 00:16:57,644
Sit down.

299
00:17:01,756 --> 00:17:02,882
Talk.

300
00:17:08,562 --> 00:17:10,860
My first marriage was lonely.

301
00:17:10,931 --> 00:17:12,558
You know.

302
00:17:12,633 --> 00:17:16,763
I can't get stuck in another marriage
with a man who doesn't love me.

303
00:17:16,837 --> 00:17:18,998
You really believe
Stan doesn't love you ?

304
00:17:19,073 --> 00:17:21,633
Well, I'm not... I don't know.

305
00:17:23,511 --> 00:17:26,605
He could just be using me for the sex,
I suppose.

306
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,910
The sex ?

307
00:17:28,983 --> 00:17:30,883
We have damn good sex.

308
00:17:32,453 --> 00:17:35,013
Sylvie, your first marriage...

309
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,858
It has nothing to do with Stan.

310
00:17:37,925 --> 00:17:40,985
You know you can't let the past
hang over you like that.

311
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:43,692
Neither can you, kid.

312
00:17:44,899 --> 00:17:46,924
You're not as screwed up as I am.

313
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:52,637
- You deserve better.
- But be honest, Pete.

314
00:17:52,706 --> 00:17:58,201
The timing of these spells and
the proposal, pretty damning, isn't it ?

315
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:05,710
OK. I know I seem like this guy
that dates women from the Internet...

316
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:09,950
OK, I am this guy who dates women from
the Internet but that's only because...

317
00:18:10,024 --> 00:18:12,390
No, scrap that. No good. OK...

318
00:18:12,493 --> 00:18:16,452
You're beautiful
and you're funny and...

319
00:18:16,564 --> 00:18:20,864
You're annoying, but in a way that's
endearing when it's not driving me crazy

320
00:18:20,935 --> 00:18:25,895
and the point is...
The point is, I love you.

321
00:18:25,973 --> 00:18:27,907
I'm in love with you

322
00:18:27,975 --> 00:18:33,003
and... I have been forever.

323
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,809
I love you.

324
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,374
I love you.

325
00:18:44,425 --> 00:18:47,588
Were you just saying
"I love you" to your genitals ?

326
00:18:47,695 --> 00:18:49,754
No.

327
00:18:56,704 --> 00:18:58,535
[Door closing]

328
00:19:10,217 --> 00:19:12,048
Hey.

329
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:14,087
There's... I want to talk to you.

330
00:19:14,188 --> 00:19:16,679
Tell you something that I... uh...

331
00:19:18,025 --> 00:19:19,720
What are you doing ?

332
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:23,924
- That's Cami's urine sample.
- You're spying on Cami's pee ?

333
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,293
No.

334
00:19:26,767 --> 00:19:30,066
This Cami thing is eating at me. Right ?

335
00:19:30,137 --> 00:19:31,968
It's really all I can think about.

336
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:34,974
So, if I were a patient,
what would I tell myself ?

337
00:19:35,042 --> 00:19:38,500
That talking to yourself like
you're two people is a sign of insanity.

338
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:42,606
I would tell my patient that they need
to figure out a way to move on.

339
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:45,379
To get some information
so that they can move on.

340
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:48,512
And that relates
to Cami's bodily fluids how ?

341
00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:50,250
What if Cami's pregnant ?

342
00:19:50,324 --> 00:19:54,590
I mean, if I know that Cami is pregnant,
that would be a big step

343
00:19:54,662 --> 00:19:58,189
in really solidifying
that it's over between me and Allan.

344
00:19:58,265 --> 00:20:01,723
Do not steal that urine.

345
00:20:01,802 --> 00:20:03,770
- Right. OK.
- Yeah.

346
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:06,396
All right. What did you
want to talk to me about ?

347
00:20:06,473 --> 00:20:08,600
It would be better later.

348
00:20:08,676 --> 00:20:12,612
No, no, no. Just tell me now. I need
to focus on something other than Cami.

349
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,240
It's just...
You know, I made this pact,

350
00:20:15,316 --> 00:20:18,285
and there are some feelings that...

351
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,378
Violet !

352
00:20:21,455 --> 00:20:23,423
Step away from the pee-pee.

353
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:27,722
Right, right. Right.
I am removing myself from the situation.

354
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:33,857
That went perfectly.

355
00:20:33,934 --> 00:20:37,062
[Violet] Rebecca doesn't totally fit
the Münchausen profile.

356
00:20:37,137 --> 00:20:39,605
Do you think
I'm personalizing this case ?

357
00:20:39,673 --> 00:20:43,803
Like maybe I need to believe
in the happy miracle baby ?

358
00:20:43,877 --> 00:20:45,401
Well, instinct's a bitch.

359
00:20:45,479 --> 00:20:48,209
You only know if you can trust it
after the fact.

360
00:20:51,185 --> 00:20:54,450
OK, look. You and I don't
know each other that well.

361
00:20:54,521 --> 00:20:55,818
We're not friends.

362
00:20:55,889 --> 00:20:59,791
But you could share.

363
00:21:01,195 --> 00:21:02,560
I guess.

364
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:05,064
No. No, no, no. I don't want to...

365
00:21:05,132 --> 00:21:08,795
Yes. Yes. Let's... share.

366
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:09,995
Yeah ?

367
00:21:11,238 --> 00:21:13,001
God. It's just...

368
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,175
I have fertility issues.

369
00:21:19,246 --> 00:21:21,407
And Naomi... I don't know.

370
00:21:21,482 --> 00:21:26,249
And I'm all cranky about it
and I have a right to be. A right.

371
00:21:26,353 --> 00:21:29,049
I'm right... and all.

372
00:21:29,123 --> 00:21:30,886
I know. You know ?

373
00:21:33,594 --> 00:21:38,088
The sharing, it's...
It's not so good.

374
00:21:38,165 --> 00:21:39,598
No.

375
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:41,430
Hey, I don't even want kids.

376
00:21:41,535 --> 00:21:43,696
But the idea
of my ex's new wife having one ?

377
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:46,773
- It's making me nuts.
- It's better to know. Get through it.

378
00:21:46,874 --> 00:21:48,569
Naomi won't tell me anything.

379
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:51,008
Let me tell you something about Naomi.

380
00:21:51,111 --> 00:21:55,275
Don't let her tell you
what you can and cannot know.

381
00:21:55,349 --> 00:21:59,285
In fact, go look at the file yourself.

382
00:21:59,353 --> 00:22:00,911
Yeah.

383
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:05,755
I mean, you just wait
until Dell is away from his domain...

384
00:22:05,826 --> 00:22:07,760
...and then you go for it.

385
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:09,796
You go get your answers.

386
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,391
You're a little bit of a crazy,
you know that ?

387
00:22:15,469 --> 00:22:18,563
- Yeah.
- I like you.

388
00:22:24,211 --> 00:22:25,769
Michael, what happened ?

389
00:22:25,846 --> 00:22:29,077
- Why'd you tell me to do that ?
- Do what ?

390
00:22:29,149 --> 00:22:31,310
I knew I shouldn't have said anything.

391
00:22:31,418 --> 00:22:33,784
Michael, who did this to you ?

392
00:22:33,887 --> 00:22:36,219
- Brian.
- OK, who's Brian ?

393
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:39,919
He's the one I asked out.

394
00:22:39,993 --> 00:22:41,756
The one I love.

395
00:22:45,566 --> 00:22:48,899
Can you imagine being ten
and already knowing who you are ?

396
00:22:48,969 --> 00:22:51,199
Some kids know. They just know.

397
00:22:51,271 --> 00:22:55,367
This poor guy came out, got his heart
broken and his ass kicked in one day.

398
00:22:55,442 --> 00:22:56,909
I got to do something.

399
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:00,346
You should do what you're doing.

400
00:23:00,447 --> 00:23:03,416
You got to listen.
Stay on top of the situation.

401
00:23:03,484 --> 00:23:07,215
Kids like Michael are at high risk
for self-destructive behavior.

402
00:23:07,287 --> 00:23:11,246
That's usually when they're teenagers.
You think he might hurt himself now ?

403
00:23:11,358 --> 00:23:12,848
It happens.

404
00:23:12,926 --> 00:23:15,394
OK. OK.

405
00:23:15,462 --> 00:23:17,623
I'll talk to his parents. Thanks.

406
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:30,543
Hello, closure.

407
00:23:30,611 --> 00:23:33,705
I'm having them run an echo
to check for heart abnormalities

408
00:23:33,781 --> 00:23:37,717
and tests to rule out artery
obstructions and seizure activities.

409
00:23:37,785 --> 00:23:41,277
All these tests. You're not
doing this just for me, are you ?

410
00:23:41,355 --> 00:23:43,482
I know I'm pushing for an answer, but...

411
00:23:43,557 --> 00:23:45,718
As much as I adore you,
I wouldn't do that.

412
00:23:45,793 --> 00:23:48,557
I'm doing it for Stan,
the guy that called me a whacko.

413
00:23:48,629 --> 00:23:49,755
Pete.

414
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:52,355
Sylvie, this is Addison. She's our gyn.

415
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:54,366
- You're new.
- How do you do ?

416
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:57,369
Pete, if you get a moment later,

417
00:23:57,437 --> 00:24:02,670
I could use you for a consult
on my patient's nutritional status.

418
00:24:03,877 --> 00:24:06,175
At which time I'd like
an RSVP to my party.

419
00:24:06,246 --> 00:24:07,543
OK.

420
00:24:08,482 --> 00:24:11,042
Or you could RSVP now.

421
00:24:14,822 --> 00:24:17,916
- I'll wait.
- Or I could uninvite you.

422
00:24:27,434 --> 00:24:28,799
You like that one.

423
00:24:28,902 --> 00:24:31,837
Don't do that. Don't mother me.

424
00:24:31,905 --> 00:24:34,373
She reminds me a little of your Anna.

425
00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:39,274
My wife was nothing like Addison.

426
00:24:39,346 --> 00:24:43,510
Well, there are similarities,
but Addison is... tougher.

427
00:24:44,618 --> 00:24:47,985
Addison doesn't need...
she doesn't need.

428
00:24:48,055 --> 00:24:50,615
Which makes her seem perfect for you.

429
00:24:50,724 --> 00:24:52,885
Can we focus on Stan ?

430
00:24:57,664 --> 00:24:59,029
This is Cami Davis' file.

431
00:24:59,099 --> 00:25:02,364
Just... I got to know. Tell me.

432
00:25:02,436 --> 00:25:05,872
- I told you I wouldn't.
- But now I'm telling you to tell me.

433
00:25:05,939 --> 00:25:07,497
No. I swore I wouldn't.

434
00:25:07,574 --> 00:25:11,442
Well, just give me the file and then
you won't have to tell me anything.

435
00:25:11,511 --> 00:25:13,240
Don't make me hurt you.

436
00:25:17,951 --> 00:25:19,714
You're freaking out a little.

437
00:25:28,795 --> 00:25:30,228
I am freaking out a little.

438
00:25:30,297 --> 00:25:32,322
Michael's missing ?

439
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:36,165
We got home and he went to lie down.
But when I checked on him, he was gone.

440
00:25:36,236 --> 00:25:40,263
I thought maybe he went to go settle
the score with those kids who hit him.

441
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,865
I've left him a dozen messages.
I texted him.

442
00:25:42,943 --> 00:25:46,106
He usually calls right back.
Do we call the police ?

443
00:25:46,179 --> 00:25:49,740
No. Let me check the school again first.
Maybe I just missed him.

444
00:25:49,816 --> 00:25:52,080
- I'll check the skate park.
- Are you sure ?

445
00:25:52,152 --> 00:25:55,644
- You've got patients.
- Let's... Let's just find Michael.

446
00:25:58,325 --> 00:26:01,294
Come here ! I felt the baby moving.
You have to feel this.

447
00:26:06,934 --> 00:26:11,098
This is Mrs. Hobart, Rebecca's mother.
The ambulance is waiting downstairs.

448
00:26:11,171 --> 00:26:12,934
Get her out of here.

449
00:26:13,006 --> 00:26:17,340
- Mrs. Hobart, she's had a rough day.
- You have no idea.

450
00:26:17,411 --> 00:26:20,380
- You want to hear how Rebecca operates ?
- Shut up, Mom !

451
00:26:20,447 --> 00:26:23,109
- Let's just take this slow.
- She starves.

452
00:26:23,183 --> 00:26:25,811
Or she eats God knows what to get sick.

453
00:26:25,886 --> 00:26:29,822
She dupes a hospital into believing her
till they figure out what's going on.

454
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:32,620
- Get her out of here !
- That's enough.

455
00:26:32,693 --> 00:26:35,753
- OK, remember our breathing ?
- [Inhaling and exhaling slowly]

456
00:26:35,829 --> 00:26:38,992
Good. Good.

457
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:48,408
What ? What is it ?

458
00:26:56,984 --> 00:26:59,145
These labs show
you haven't eaten in days.

459
00:26:59,219 --> 00:27:00,846
She lied.

460
00:27:00,921 --> 00:27:03,754
- She has been making herself sick.
- What a shock.

461
00:27:03,824 --> 00:27:05,985
No, no, I did eat !

462
00:27:08,595 --> 00:27:11,530
I'll make sure
her contractions are gone.

463
00:27:12,532 --> 00:27:14,295
Then she's yours.

464
00:27:15,035 --> 00:27:18,061
I thought you believed me.

465
00:27:20,173 --> 00:27:21,504
I did.

466
00:27:23,143 --> 00:27:24,474
Oh, God.

467
00:27:32,486 --> 00:27:34,818
OK. I have Stan's labs.

468
00:27:36,123 --> 00:27:39,559
MRI looks good. Blood levels, good.

469
00:27:39,626 --> 00:27:43,187
- All the tests check out OK.
- Thank God.

470
00:27:44,731 --> 00:27:45,891
Right ?

471
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:51,301
Sylvie. You don't know... We don't know
that this has anything to do with you.

472
00:27:51,371 --> 00:27:54,397
Then find me another answer.

473
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:12,852
So much for being inspired, huh ?

474
00:28:22,102 --> 00:28:23,933
Oh, crap. Addison. Wait.

475
00:28:24,004 --> 00:28:25,494
Wait up !

476
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,403
Uh... We need a little bit more time
with your daughter.

477
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:32,603
- Sam.
- Dr. Bennett, this is...

478
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:36,740
You've been through hell. And maybe
your daughter is a master manipulator.

479
00:28:36,817 --> 00:28:40,275
But she risked a lot to come here

480
00:28:40,353 --> 00:28:43,117
because she thought we were different.

481
00:28:44,124 --> 00:28:45,557
And better.

482
00:28:46,493 --> 00:28:48,256
And I believe we are.

483
00:28:49,863 --> 00:28:52,627
We can figure out
what's wrong with your daughter.

484
00:28:52,699 --> 00:28:55,190
- We need a little more time.
- You think...

485
00:28:55,268 --> 00:28:58,931
- Sam, please don't indulge this.
- [Sam] We want to help your daughter.

486
00:28:59,005 --> 00:29:00,666
That's all we ask.

487
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:09,749
OK. One hour.

488
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:12,611
You get one more hour.

489
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,354
Brian ?

490
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:27,559
Do you know where Michael is ?

491
00:29:28,401 --> 00:29:30,096
Hey, hey, hey. Whoa.

492
00:29:30,837 --> 00:29:32,270
Where's Michael ?

493
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:34,102
- He's a freak.
- He's your friend.

494
00:29:34,207 --> 00:29:36,971
No, he's not ! I thought he was
until he said that stuff.

495
00:29:37,043 --> 00:29:40,103
- You hit him 'cause he said something ?
- He asked me on a date !

496
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,444
And I bet he wishes he didn't,
but he did.

497
00:29:42,516 --> 00:29:45,679
So, he's going
to have to live with that. Can you ?

498
00:29:45,752 --> 00:29:49,188
He can't just go around
saying stuff like that. Not here.

499
00:29:49,256 --> 00:29:52,089
- Michael's missing. I need to find him.
- He's what ?

500
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,320
- Do you know where he could be ?
- No.

501
00:29:54,427 --> 00:29:56,054
Hey, Brian ! Come on.

502
00:29:57,397 --> 00:30:01,356
There's a parking lot where we hang at.
There's a cool ramp that we skate on.

503
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:03,800
Maybe he'd go there.

504
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:06,236
I didn't mean to hit him so hard.

505
00:30:07,073 --> 00:30:09,701
- Tell him I'm sorry, OK ?
- Thanks.

506
00:30:09,776 --> 00:30:12,142
Sam, I appreciate
what you're trying to do,

507
00:30:12,212 --> 00:30:14,510
but what can we possibly find
in an hour ?

508
00:30:14,581 --> 00:30:17,209
Why did you make promises
you know we can't keep ?

509
00:30:17,284 --> 00:30:19,752
Because maybe we can. OK ?

510
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:24,688
Is there anything else we need to cover
before we can get our heads in the game ?

511
00:30:24,758 --> 00:30:29,320
I have a need.
I need to know why Cami is here.

512
00:30:29,429 --> 00:30:32,091
- You made me promise not to tell you...
- Spill.

513
00:30:36,069 --> 00:30:40,335
It's a bladder infection.
From having too much sex.

514
00:30:42,576 --> 00:30:45,340
Cami and Allan
have been having a lot of sex.

515
00:30:45,445 --> 00:30:47,072
Good. It's not cancer.

516
00:30:48,248 --> 00:30:50,978
I was just afraid it might be cancer.

517
00:30:51,051 --> 00:30:52,177
Well, it isn't.

518
00:30:52,252 --> 00:30:54,618
Good. Done.
Now... Rebecca.

519
00:31:02,295 --> 00:31:03,592
Michael.

520
00:31:10,437 --> 00:31:12,564
I was gonna run away.

521
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,173
But I don't have any money.

522
00:31:15,242 --> 00:31:17,540
Besides, running away is lame.

523
00:31:19,145 --> 00:31:22,808
- So then I thought I'd just jump.
- Michael.

524
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:25,783
Then jumping's even lamer
than running away.

525
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:27,918
I talked to Brian.

526
00:31:29,589 --> 00:31:31,955
He feels pretty bad.

527
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:35,425
Yeah, well, he doesn't love me back.

528
00:31:35,495 --> 00:31:37,053
No.

529
00:31:48,174 --> 00:31:50,267
Look, some kids are cool with it.

530
00:31:50,343 --> 00:31:53,005
Yeah, but I don't want
to hang out with them.

531
00:31:54,047 --> 00:31:56,174
I want to hang out with Brian.

532
00:31:59,786 --> 00:32:01,720
I wish I was somebody else.

533
00:32:02,689 --> 00:32:04,850
What are you talking about ?

534
00:32:05,725 --> 00:32:07,556
I wish I was you.

535
00:32:09,629 --> 00:32:11,460
- You're old.
- Yeah. I am old.

536
00:32:11,531 --> 00:32:14,398
I am elderly. But you're young.

537
00:32:14,467 --> 00:32:17,402
You will have a lot of chances
to fall in love again

538
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:20,439
with someone who's really into you,
big time.

539
00:32:21,441 --> 00:32:24,137
And me being so old and all, right ?
I'm done.

540
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:26,940
This one, this girl, this love ?

541
00:32:27,013 --> 00:32:29,481
That's probably it for me.

542
00:32:29,549 --> 00:32:32,040
And I didn't have the guts
to tell her how I felt.

543
00:32:32,118 --> 00:32:35,349
I looked at her, I just... I couldn't.

544
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,148
You told Brian.

545
00:32:39,926 --> 00:32:42,486
And you're a lot braver than I am.

546
00:32:45,231 --> 00:32:46,755
Damn.

547
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:48,960
You little punk.

548
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,601
I don't want to go home yet.

549
00:32:55,709 --> 00:32:57,734
We can hang out for a while.

550
00:32:58,378 --> 00:33:00,938
Then we need to tell your folks
you're OK.

551
00:33:08,221 --> 00:33:12,555
I don't know. I don't...
Nothing's jumping out at me.

552
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:14,388
You're the one who believed. Why ?

553
00:33:14,494 --> 00:33:17,054
Because I thought
she was telling the truth.

554
00:33:21,634 --> 00:33:24,660
Ignore the files.
Ignore all preconceptions

555
00:33:24,738 --> 00:33:26,569
and let's look at the facts

556
00:33:26,639 --> 00:33:30,131
as if everything Rebecca has told us
is the truth.

557
00:33:31,644 --> 00:33:34,943
Which would mean
that the hospital missed something.

558
00:33:35,014 --> 00:33:37,346
Then she's saddled
with a psych diagnosis.

559
00:33:37,417 --> 00:33:40,181
The doctors would assume
that her worsening symptoms

560
00:33:40,286 --> 00:33:42,720
are just signs of destructive behavior.

561
00:33:42,789 --> 00:33:45,656
That could indicate a worsening
of her real condition.

562
00:33:45,725 --> 00:33:48,694
So, what's the missing illness
that started it all ?

563
00:33:48,795 --> 00:33:52,094
One that makes her feel
stomach spasms and pain after she eats.

564
00:33:52,165 --> 00:33:54,929
Associated with occasional
joint pains and fevers.

565
00:33:55,001 --> 00:33:57,435
And comes and goes in cycles.

566
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:59,335
Did they ever get a GI camera study ?

567
00:33:59,406 --> 00:34:02,239
- I didn't see it in her records.
- [Violet] How'd that help ?

568
00:34:02,308 --> 00:34:05,277
The camera could get to places
in Rebecca's body

569
00:34:05,378 --> 00:34:09,007
that previous work-ups couldn't
have seen. It's a new procedure.

570
00:34:09,082 --> 00:34:11,846
If she had an occult form
of an autoimmune disease...

571
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:14,682
Affecting deep sections
of the intestines...

572
00:34:14,788 --> 00:34:18,690
- It would flare-up in times of stress.
- She wouldn't absorb nutrients.

573
00:34:18,758 --> 00:34:21,625
Explains why she says she eats,
but labs say she's not.

574
00:34:21,694 --> 00:34:23,423
So they could've missed it.

575
00:34:23,496 --> 00:34:26,226
- They definitely could've missed it.
- All right.

576
00:34:26,299 --> 00:34:28,961
I was playing tug of war
with the wheelchair.

577
00:34:29,035 --> 00:34:31,902
- Charlotte is stronger than she looks.
- They took her ?

578
00:34:31,971 --> 00:34:34,838
- Rebecca's gone ?
- She's gone.

579
00:34:40,146 --> 00:34:44,480
Do you know what this girl's mother will
say if she finds out I ran another test ?

580
00:34:44,551 --> 00:34:48,487
What will she say if the test could save
Rebecca's life ? Hers and the baby's.

581
00:34:49,055 --> 00:34:51,421
Y'all really want me to get fired,
don't you ?

582
00:34:51,524 --> 00:34:54,550
If you need a win
to get the hospital off your back,

583
00:34:54,627 --> 00:34:58,256
- take full credit for the fix.
- I don't care about the credit.

584
00:34:58,331 --> 00:35:01,300
OK, I do care about the credit.

585
00:35:02,969 --> 00:35:05,096
But I care about helping this girl more.

586
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:08,940
We'll set up for the camera study.

587
00:35:12,078 --> 00:35:13,443
All right.

588
00:35:14,047 --> 00:35:16,208
Something Sylvie said has me wondering.

589
00:35:16,316 --> 00:35:18,284
I spoke to you in confidence.

590
00:35:18,384 --> 00:35:20,318
I might know what's wrong with Stan.

591
00:35:20,386 --> 00:35:22,820
- You do ?
- You two have been having a lot of sex ?

592
00:35:22,889 --> 00:35:25,255
- A gentleman doesn't discuss...
- Yes.

593
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:26,586
Different positions ?

594
00:35:26,659 --> 00:35:31,221
I'm not going to stand here and
get the third degree from this pervert.

595
00:35:31,297 --> 00:35:33,162
Mostly one position.

596
00:35:33,233 --> 00:35:34,962
Because of his sciatica, I'm on top.

597
00:35:35,034 --> 00:35:39,528
- Hmm... Show me.
- Oh, for the love of... What ?

598
00:35:39,606 --> 00:35:41,073
Sylvie !

599
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:45,270
He holds me here.
Supporting me on account of my hip.

600
00:35:45,345 --> 00:35:48,473
OK. Good.

601
00:35:50,183 --> 00:35:52,708
This is where I draw the line. I...

602
00:35:59,859 --> 00:36:01,292
Stan, you OK ?

603
00:36:01,361 --> 00:36:04,694
Does that happen
every time you press there ?

604
00:36:04,764 --> 00:36:08,598
All that repetitive motion formed
a trigger point in the muscle,

605
00:36:08,668 --> 00:36:10,329
causing a painless migraine.

606
00:36:10,403 --> 00:36:12,371
You move the wrong way, you pass out.

607
00:36:12,438 --> 00:36:13,803
Painless migraine ?

608
00:36:13,873 --> 00:36:16,740
You get the neurological signs,
but never the headache.

609
00:36:16,809 --> 00:36:17,969
And that's all it was ?

610
00:36:18,044 --> 00:36:20,308
My intensive muscle therapy
should do it.

611
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:25,079
And we can treat that sciatica, so that
you can try some new sexual positions.

612
00:36:33,493 --> 00:36:35,825
- He loves me.
- I told you.

613
00:36:35,895 --> 00:36:38,955
Thank you, Pete.
You don't know how much this means.

614
00:36:40,233 --> 00:36:42,167
Or, yes you do.

615
00:36:42,235 --> 00:36:44,100
Now it's your turn.

616
00:37:06,626 --> 00:37:08,560
Why are you here ? In my practice ?

617
00:37:08,628 --> 00:37:11,256
Throwing your too-much-sex-itis
in my face ?

618
00:37:11,331 --> 00:37:12,491
You know about that ?

619
00:37:12,565 --> 00:37:15,534
There are a million other doctors
you could've gone to.

620
00:37:15,602 --> 00:37:19,265
Why did you come to the place
where I work ? Just to mess with me ?

621
00:37:19,339 --> 00:37:21,807
I just needed to pick up the results
of my labs.

622
00:37:21,874 --> 00:37:24,604
That still doesn't answer the question !
Why here ?

623
00:37:25,645 --> 00:37:28,478
He talks about you.
I mean, all of you.

624
00:37:28,548 --> 00:37:29,810
How good you are.

625
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:32,584
I wanted the best.

626
00:37:34,787 --> 00:37:36,277
You're here to scope me out.

627
00:37:39,225 --> 00:37:41,557
I shouldn't have come, I'm sorry.

628
00:37:41,628 --> 00:37:42,959
Cami.

629
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:44,822
Cami.

630
00:37:46,366 --> 00:37:49,802
You don't need to worry.
You're like two years old.

631
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:54,597
You're pretty,
you're the Barbie Dreamhouse.

632
00:37:54,674 --> 00:37:57,643
I am not your competition. Trust me.

633
00:37:58,845 --> 00:38:00,813
I wouldn't be so sure.

634
00:38:18,865 --> 00:38:20,423
We've got the results.

635
00:38:21,601 --> 00:38:25,093
- And ?
- You have Crohn's disease.

636
00:38:25,171 --> 00:38:28,004
You were eating
and it was making you sick.

637
00:38:28,074 --> 00:38:29,974
So you believe me ?

638
00:38:31,244 --> 00:38:33,678
- I believe you.
- You believe me.

639
00:38:33,746 --> 00:38:35,771
You believe me.

640
00:38:35,848 --> 00:38:39,306
The chances of your baby being healthy
are very good.

641
00:38:53,132 --> 00:38:54,497
I'm sorry.

642
00:38:57,403 --> 00:39:00,566
[Both crying]

643
00:39:08,214 --> 00:39:09,977
[Naomi] Hey. Hey.

644
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:14,019
- How did it go ? How's Rebecca ?
- Dr. Sam hasn't lost his touch.

645
00:39:14,087 --> 00:39:16,749
You ? I'm the one...

646
00:39:16,823 --> 00:39:20,987
Fine. Dr. Sam is a god. Today.

647
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:24,928
- Do you want some wine ?
- You guys are hanging out here ?

648
00:39:24,997 --> 00:39:28,364
Yeah, we have red and I can get
some white from the fridge.

649
00:39:30,403 --> 00:39:32,667
You know, no. Wait. No.

650
00:39:32,739 --> 00:39:36,175
I got food.
I bought a barbecue grill.

651
00:39:36,242 --> 00:39:38,574
I dragged bags of ice across the beach !

652
00:39:38,644 --> 00:39:42,740
And I invited all of you people and none
of you even bothered to RSVP

653
00:39:42,815 --> 00:39:45,306
because your lives
are so busy and great,

654
00:39:45,384 --> 00:39:49,411
and yet here you sit drinking wine
in the lobby like animals.

655
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:52,485
- We're coming.
- [Pete] Yeah.

656
00:39:52,558 --> 00:39:55,823
We were waiting for you guys
to get back from the hospital.

657
00:39:56,562 --> 00:39:57,722
Oh...

658
00:39:59,098 --> 00:40:00,793
I... Well then...

659
00:40:00,867 --> 00:40:03,131
[ ? The Thrills :
<i>There's Joy to be Found]</i>

660
00:40:06,773 --> 00:40:09,708
There's no way she's right.
He is not thinking about me.

661
00:40:09,776 --> 00:40:12,609
Of course he's thinking about you,
are you an idiot ?

662
00:40:12,678 --> 00:40:16,808
- You don't have to be mean about it.
- Well, you're hard to forget.

663
00:40:19,352 --> 00:40:20,512
Cooper.

664
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:24,386
What, I'm just saying, you are very
loud, you have a lot of curly hair...

665
00:40:31,764 --> 00:40:33,129
Boys.

666
00:40:38,404 --> 00:40:41,168
OK. You have been pissed off
at me all day.

667
00:40:42,241 --> 00:40:46,200
I was wrong about Rebecca. I'm sorry.

668
00:40:46,746 --> 00:40:50,580
Why'd you tell me that there was no hope
for me to ever have a baby ?

669
00:40:53,219 --> 00:40:57,315
- Because...
- I have two eggs left. Two.

670
00:41:00,193 --> 00:41:04,425
I looked at my chart. Why didn't you
tell me that my FSH was borderline ?

671
00:41:04,497 --> 00:41:06,260
It means there's still a chance.

672
00:41:06,332 --> 00:41:09,495
Didn't want you hanging on to something
that'll probably never happen.

673
00:41:09,602 --> 00:41:12,230
You need to stop protecting me.

674
00:41:12,305 --> 00:41:15,536
You don't get to decide
what I hang on to.

675
00:41:17,543 --> 00:41:20,876
What, and Sam with his mindlbody thing ?

676
00:41:20,947 --> 00:41:25,008
He inspired you to look again,
to ask for more ?

677
00:41:26,385 --> 00:41:27,750
That's his thing now.

678
00:41:28,855 --> 00:41:30,288
Yeah.

679
00:41:31,357 --> 00:41:35,623
It made me feel like... there's hope.

680
00:41:36,495 --> 00:41:38,360
That I'm not alone.

681
00:41:38,431 --> 00:41:40,194
You think you're alone ?

682
00:41:40,299 --> 00:41:41,766
Look around.

683
00:41:52,178 --> 00:41:54,408
Hey. What you all talking about ?

684
00:41:55,314 --> 00:41:57,782
Oh, a strong, proud bald man.

685
00:42:04,557 --> 00:42:08,220
- It really is just an arm and a hammer.
- Let it go, Sam.

686
00:42:08,294 --> 00:42:10,455
Please. Please.
