00:00:10,795 --> 00:00:11,887
Hey.

3
00:00:15,066 --> 00:00:17,432
- What ?
- You kissed me.

4
00:00:17,535 --> 00:00:19,833
And then you walked away.

5
00:00:19,904 --> 00:00:22,930
- Messes with your head, huh ?
- So it was a revenge kiss.

6
00:00:23,007 --> 00:00:24,838
No, no. Not intentionally.

7
00:00:24,909 --> 00:00:29,608
But then watching you
get all swirly since then ?

8
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,580
It's kind of gratifying.

00:00:41,692 --> 00:00:44,126
[Addison moans]

10
00:00:47,999 --> 00:00:49,660
I think we should stop kissing.

[Addison sighs]

12
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:55,296
Oh.

13
00:00:55,373 --> 00:00:57,705
I mean, come on. What are we, 12 ?

14
00:00:57,775 --> 00:01:01,404
No, we definitely are not.

15
00:01:02,513 --> 00:01:06,677
Which is why I do not

16
00:01:06,784 --> 00:01:11,881

in your acupuncture table.

17
00:01:13,224 --> 00:01:14,691
I want more.

18
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:18,126
What do you say we just see how it goes ?

19
00:01:19,764 --> 00:01:21,698
Tonight.

20
00:01:29,073 --> 00:01:30,631
I can work with that.

21
00:01:35,446 --> 00:01:38,472
We... were just talking about a case.

22
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:40,676
She needed a consult on the...

23
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,984
Locked in the Dell vault. All right ?

24
00:01:45,089 --> 00:01:47,182
Patients are here.

25
00:01:53,764 --> 00:01:57,097
- We are in the Dell vault.
- Locked in the Dell vault.

26
00:02:00,638 --> 00:02:03,266
Who keeps sticking bananas
in the refrigerator ?

27
00:02:03,341 --> 00:02:05,502
I... um, that would be me.

28
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:10,309
Bananas need the climate of the equator.
Never stick bananas in the refrigerator.

29
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:16,050
- Susan McCullough's on her way in.
- How'd she sound ?

30
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,250
I believe her exact words were,
"You guys better not screw this up."

31
00:02:20,324 --> 00:02:22,224
Blocking the toaster. Hello ?

32
00:02:22,293 --> 00:02:25,524
- That toast needs to happen now.
- Somebody needs to get...

33
00:02:25,596 --> 00:02:28,156
- Don't say it.
- I wasn't going to say "laid."

34
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,591
[Addison] So we're
inducing Susan today, right ?

35
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:34,934
Yes. It is very important to her
that we follow her labor plan.

36
00:02:35,006 --> 00:02:38,373
That's Pete's relaxation techniques,
the birthing tub...

37
00:02:38,476 --> 00:02:42,105
Honestly, not a big fan of the tub.
There's fluids in there.

38
00:02:42,179 --> 00:02:45,546
Blood, uterine tissue,
sometimes fecal matter.

39
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,676
OK. You made me think about it.

40
00:02:48,753 --> 00:02:51,313
They're big and wet
and difficult to work with.

41
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:53,652
They don't use
those things in hospitals.

42
00:02:53,724 --> 00:02:56,215
She's my patient.
We'll do it the way she wants.

43
00:02:56,294 --> 00:03:00,458
I'm not really comfortable
being a birth coach.

44
00:03:00,564 --> 00:03:03,727
- That's not what I do.
- Really ? Because...

45
00:03:03,801 --> 00:03:06,497
Susan was widowed
a few months into her pregnancy.

46
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:09,198
Her husband Jason was a cop.
He was killed on duty.

47
00:03:09,774 --> 00:03:11,298
Oh, that's...

48
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:15,243
She's had panic attacks and
that would be a problem during a birth.

49
00:03:15,313 --> 00:03:17,611
She doesn't have family,
so she's on her own.

50
00:03:17,682 --> 00:03:20,549
- I promised her we'd take care of her.
- OK. OK.

51
00:03:20,618 --> 00:03:23,178
I'll have Dell go ahead
and prepare the bath tub.

00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,808
<i>I'm afraid it might get worse.</i>
<i>A lot worse.</i>

59
00:03:51,882 --> 00:03:55,511
OK. I guess I can run over there
and check it out.

OK. Uh, I'm going to need
the lights dimmed.

And we can put

- Where's the music I asked for ?
- I have it.

00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:22,279
Why don't you relax ?
We'll get everything taken care of.

68
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,610
I know.
Got a plan and we're following it.

69
00:04:24,682 --> 00:04:27,583
As we discussed,
not everything is under our control.

70
00:04:27,651 --> 00:04:30,347
- Babies have plans of their own.
- I'm prepared.

71
00:04:30,421 --> 00:04:34,755
I wrote down all the contingencies.
Dr. Montgomery, it's baby day.

72
00:04:34,825 --> 00:04:39,319
Hi, Susan. As soon as Pete
does his relaxation therapy,

73
00:04:39,397 --> 00:04:41,729
- I will be back to...
- Administer the Pitocin

74
00:04:41,799 --> 00:04:44,131
after you remove
the prostaglandin insert.

75
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:47,261
- That's exactly right.
- OK. So let's do this.

- Dad, look at this.
- Oh, hey ! [groans]

- Hey, Malcolm, you got a game today ?
- Uh-huh.

- I caught a fly in the toilet !
- You did ? No way. Really ? Good work.

- I'm hanging in.

- It's about time. I'm so excited.

- Danny ! Give Mal back his mitt.

I moved some things. I like getting air.

I know going off schedule is something
that's hard for you to grasp...

101

I can grasp it just fine, thank you.

- Really.

- Where's he going ?
- House call.

105
00:06:13,858 --> 00:06:15,519
Whatever.

106
00:06:16,093 --> 00:06:18,186
We need to do something about Pete.

107
00:06:18,262 --> 00:06:20,526
Does he know
what he's doing with Addison ?

108
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:23,761
- What is he doing with Addison ?
- Oh, no. Did they ?

109
00:06:23,868 --> 00:06:27,565
- It's imminent.
- This is so none of my business.

110
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:29,401
It's none of my business, either.

111
00:06:29,507 --> 00:06:32,533
Listen, Pete already proved
he shouldn't date at work.

112
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:36,376
Maybe Addison decided to enjoy herself.
Men do it all the time.

113
00:06:36,447 --> 00:06:40,178
- Right. That's fine.
- It's empowering for women, actually.

114
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:42,116
Causal sex. It can be.

115
00:06:42,186 --> 00:06:44,484
As long as the boundaries are clear.

116
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:49,152
And I'm very, very good
with boundaries. Aren't I ?

117
00:06:49,226 --> 00:06:53,720
Not really, no.
But you're looking right through me.

118
00:06:53,797 --> 00:06:56,493
I'm guessing you're not
hearing a word I'm saying.

119
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:14,173

120
00:07:15,986 --> 00:07:17,146

It's him. Thanks for coming.

- Yeah.
- I'm so sorry.

Uh, are you OK ? Your leg...

125
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:49,416
I didn't call you here for me.
I called you here for him.

126
00:07:49,486 --> 00:07:50,646
For...

00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:00,089
- Sara, what's going on ?
- [Man] It's my leg.

00:08:03,968 --> 00:08:06,459
- What happened to you ?
- She shot me.

129
00:08:06,537 --> 00:08:08,437
You shot him ?

130
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,409
Not her. Me. I shot him.

131
00:08:14,011 --> 00:08:15,478
OK.

132
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,049
Fix him. You're a doctor, right ?

133
00:08:25,122 --> 00:08:27,613
She said you were a doctor.
You got to fix him.

134
00:08:27,691 --> 00:08:30,251

135
00:08:30,361 --> 00:08:33,853
Everyone else is fine. Except for her.
She's crazy ! She shot me !

136
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:36,695
It was an accident ! I'm sorry !
I said I was sorry !

137
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,099
OK, everybody. Let's be calm. Sara.

138
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:44,436
She wanted a doctor. You're the only one
I know that makes house calls.

139
00:08:44,508 --> 00:08:47,534
- After you called the police ?
- She didn't want the police.

140
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,545
Of course not. Because she's crazy !

142
00:08:55,486 --> 00:08:59,252
I'm Officer Kevin Nelson. I'm here
for Susan McCullough's delivery.

143
00:08:59,356 --> 00:09:02,416
- She expecting you ?
- No. I'm just here to support Susan.

144
00:09:02,493 --> 00:09:04,518
She said she didn't want anybody,

145
00:09:04,595 --> 00:09:07,826
but I wanted to come down
in case she changed her mind.

146
00:09:07,898 --> 00:09:09,957
- I'll let her know.
- Thank you.

00:09:10,034 --> 00:09:13,162
- You waiting to see a doctor ?
- I'm here to support a friend.

I'm a police officer. Kevin Nelson.

Addison Montgomery.

150
00:09:19,276 --> 00:09:21,972
Dr. Addison Montgomery.

151
00:09:22,046 --> 00:09:23,707
Nice to meet you, doctor.

152
00:09:28,252 --> 00:09:29,810
OK.

153
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:41,054
There's an Officer Kevin Nelson
here for you.

154
00:09:41,131 --> 00:09:42,393
Are you serious ?

155
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,790
Uh...

156
00:09:45,803 --> 00:09:47,464
He was Jason's partner.

157
00:09:48,972 --> 00:09:51,065
That's nice of him to come check on you.

158
00:09:51,141 --> 00:09:55,840
It is, but he's going to get emotional,
turn this into a memorial for Jason.

159
00:09:55,913 --> 00:09:58,973
I don't want that.
Jason wouldn't have wanted that.

160
00:09:59,049 --> 00:10:01,677
This should be about the baby.

161
00:10:01,752 --> 00:10:05,313
You just tell him I'm fine.
He can go back to work.

162
00:10:11,729 --> 00:10:13,458
- Are you OK ?
- Um...

163
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:18,630
Yeah, I just... I feel a little anxious.
He shouldn't be here.

164
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:22,730
I didn't want to think about it. God.

165
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,172
Remember the visualizations
we worked on ?

166
00:10:25,242 --> 00:10:27,870
Focus on those images.

167
00:10:27,945 --> 00:10:29,173
OK ?

168
00:10:29,747 --> 00:10:34,116
We're following the plan.
Everything's right on schedule.

169
00:10:37,788 --> 00:10:40,723
OK. I'm fine.

170
00:10:41,258 --> 00:10:42,418
Totally fine.

171
00:10:45,462 --> 00:10:49,558
When you have sex, when there's no
romantic entanglement, which is never...

172
00:10:49,633 --> 00:10:50,964
Yes, thank you.

173
00:10:51,034 --> 00:10:55,061
- Now I'm an emotional dwarf ?
- No, that's not what I'm talking about.

174
00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:59,439
Is it about that I said you needed to
get laid, which I didn't say verbally.

175
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:02,377
No, listen. Listen.
I've been thinking about this.

176
00:11:03,313 --> 00:11:07,750
When you do it, it's just
no-nonsense, uncomplicated sex, right ?

177
00:11:07,818 --> 00:11:10,981
Just simple, stress-reducing, fun.

178
00:11:11,054 --> 00:11:13,147
That's the idea.

179
00:11:13,223 --> 00:11:15,589
What, are you asking me
to have sex with you ?

180
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:18,127
Yeah. Why not ? You and me.

181
00:11:18,195 --> 00:11:21,426
Friends with benefits. Tonight.

182
00:11:21,498 --> 00:11:26,595
I mean, you're right. I am stressed out
and I just need some touch.

183
00:11:27,337 --> 00:11:31,068
And you're perfect because unemotional
sex is the only kind you have.

184
00:11:31,141 --> 00:11:32,802
Shh.

185
00:11:32,876 --> 00:11:35,003
- What time should I come over ?
- Really ?

186
00:11:35,078 --> 00:11:36,136
Really.

187
00:11:44,421 --> 00:11:47,754
- Cooper, can you take Sam's 11 :30 ?
- I'm getting laid tonight.

188
00:11:47,825 --> 00:11:50,123
Congratulations. What's her screen name ?

189
00:11:50,194 --> 00:11:52,059
No. Me and Violet.

190
00:11:52,896 --> 00:11:56,332
- What ?
- Friends with benefits. Her idea.

191
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,698
No strings. No expectations.
No downside.

192
00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:01,101
- That's smart ?
- Glass house, stone thrower.

193
00:12:01,171 --> 00:12:05,005
You remember the last time
you dated a doctor in this practice ?

194
00:12:05,075 --> 00:12:07,635
Now you and Addison
have this little weird thing.

195
00:12:07,744 --> 00:12:09,507
- I can make it work.
- Based on what ?

196
00:12:09,613 --> 00:12:12,138
"Addison you moved
here because I kissed you."

197
00:12:12,216 --> 00:12:14,548
"Pete, you fake doctor.
Your touch heals."

198
00:12:14,618 --> 00:12:18,384
You think things are going to be
the same after you've seen her naked ?

199
00:12:18,455 --> 00:12:22,118
I think things are gonna be better
because I will have seen her naked.

200
00:12:22,192 --> 00:12:25,161
I'm getting laid.

201
00:12:25,262 --> 00:12:27,730
[Whistling]

202
00:12:29,366 --> 00:12:30,924
Ashley, this is Dr. Bennett.

203
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:34,493
Things are busy today, so
she's going to be monitoring your case.

204
00:12:34,571 --> 00:12:37,096
Maybe mommy would like
some time alone.

205
00:12:37,975 --> 00:12:41,638
We can have someone watch your kids
if you want to stay with your wife.

206
00:12:41,712 --> 00:12:45,478
- I get queasy during these things.
- He'll be more trouble than good.

207
00:12:45,582 --> 00:12:49,040
- Take the boys to the lobby.
- What am I supposed to do with them ?

208
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:52,282
Well, I don't know, honey.
Just occupy them.

209
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:55,358
Come on, guys. Ready ?
Here you go. Let's go. Come on.

210
00:12:55,425 --> 00:12:57,689
- Bye, sweetie.
- [Boy screams]

211
00:12:57,761 --> 00:13:01,094
Naomi ? Addison ? We have a situation.

212
00:13:01,164 --> 00:13:06,124
I told them that Susan said no, but
then a bunch more of them showed up.

213
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:10,071
[Men murmuring]

214
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,107
What's going on ?

215
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:14,666
Susan doesn't want anybody in there,
but she's part of our family

216
00:13:14,745 --> 00:13:17,305
and we're not going
to leave one of our own alone.

217
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:20,214
The guys coming off shift,
they want to be here for her.

218
00:13:20,284 --> 00:13:23,549
Now I'm not comfortable
with this whole birthing myself,

219
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:26,453
but Keith here,
he's got two kids, another on the way.

220
00:13:26,523 --> 00:13:28,013
So he's good to go in.

221
00:13:28,091 --> 00:13:32,118
I don't think
Susan is going to change her mind.

222
00:13:32,195 --> 00:13:34,561
Susan, she's just a kid.

223
00:13:34,631 --> 00:13:37,600
Yeah, but she needs
to do this her own way.

224
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:42,770
All right.
Well, we'll wait here. We're staying.

225
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:46,635
How do you feel ?

226
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,678
How do you think ?
I feel like I got shot.

227
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:52,306
- [Knocking]
- We're closed !

228
00:13:58,855 --> 00:14:02,018
- [Groaning]
- Sorry. Sorry. Sorry about that.

229
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:06,084
It's been a while since
I've had to deal with a bullet wound.

230
00:14:06,163 --> 00:14:09,997
He's more of a mindlbody doctor.

231
00:14:10,067 --> 00:14:13,298
- Dr. Feel Good ?
- Yeah. Hi. Hello.

232
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:16,305
MindlBody ? I need a doctor.

233
00:14:16,373 --> 00:14:19,934
- Do you even know what you're doing ?
- I know exactly what I'm doing.

234
00:14:20,043 --> 00:14:22,876
- It's a good color, strong pulse.
- [Woman] I need a doctor !

235
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:24,504
I am a doctor.

236
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:28,311
The bullet missed the artery,
probably just nicked the muscle.

237
00:14:28,385 --> 00:14:30,853
I need a doctor for me.

238
00:14:33,724 --> 00:14:35,282
My water just broke.

239
00:14:41,498 --> 00:14:44,433
- What's taking so long ?
- OK. All right. Just take this.

240
00:14:44,501 --> 00:14:47,470
- Put it there and apply pressure.
- You're helping her ?

241
00:14:47,571 --> 00:14:50,233
Shut up ! It's a flesh wound.
You're gonna be fine.

242
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:52,434
OK, ma'am.
You're in labor, all right ?

243
00:14:52,509 --> 00:14:54,807
- Should try to get you to a hospital.
- No !

244
00:14:54,878 --> 00:14:57,506
OK. OK.
Well, then let me just call 911.

245
00:14:57,581 --> 00:15:00,641
No ! No cops ! No 911 !

246
00:15:00,717 --> 00:15:03,652
You're delivering this baby,
and you're doing it now !

247
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:07,320
OK.

248
00:15:07,391 --> 00:15:11,327
OK. OK, if you don't mind,
I'm just going to make one quick call.

249
00:15:11,395 --> 00:15:14,125
I said no cops !
Don't try anything ! I said no cops !

250
00:15:14,197 --> 00:15:17,894
I want to call a colleague so I can
give you the help that you need.

251
00:15:17,968 --> 00:15:19,526
Please.

252
00:15:22,906 --> 00:15:27,343
- You dial and you hand me the phone.
- OK. I'm dialing. You see ?

253
00:15:30,213 --> 00:15:31,305
All right.

254
00:15:31,715 --> 00:15:34,684
Don't try and take the gun,
that's how I got shot.

255
00:15:35,452 --> 00:15:36,885
- OK.
- OK.

256
00:15:37,654 --> 00:15:39,019
Hey, Naomi, it's Sam.

257
00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:43,355
I need your help.
I'm about to deliver a baby.

258
00:15:43,427 --> 00:15:46,294
- I thought you were on a house call ?
- I am. Well, I was.

259
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:50,629
But then I ran into a really nice lady
and she is in labor.

260
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:55,069
Uh, hold on, Sam.
Monitor Ashley Minnehan's contractions

261
00:15:55,172 --> 00:15:58,198
and tell me the second
she's dilated to four centimeters.

262
00:15:58,275 --> 00:15:59,606
Really ? A birth ?

263
00:15:59,676 --> 00:16:01,644
Bring me in
as soon as she's ready to go.

264
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,872
- Yeah. OK. Great.
- OK ? Understand ?

265
00:16:03,947 --> 00:16:05,107
- Yeah !
- All right.

266
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:06,443
Where are you ?

267
00:16:06,516 --> 00:16:09,542
I don't have time to talk.
So if we could just get to it...

268
00:16:09,619 --> 00:16:12,986
OK. Fine. Is she fully dilated ?

269
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:14,648
Just a minute.

270
00:16:18,495 --> 00:16:21,726
- I'm here to monitor your contractions.
- All right.

271
00:16:22,499 --> 00:16:25,400
Uh, any questions or concerns ?
Anything I can do to help ?

272
00:16:25,469 --> 00:16:29,735
Oh, no. Nah, I've done three of these.
I just say a little prayer and go.

273
00:16:29,806 --> 00:16:33,867
And you just sit there and catch
the baby like it's a football, OK ?

274
00:16:34,678 --> 00:16:35,702
Oh.

275
00:16:43,954 --> 00:16:48,118
Can I just say, it's a good thing that
Pete is getting me now because I am hot.

276
00:16:48,225 --> 00:16:50,557
I am on <i>fuego.</i>

277
00:16:50,627 --> 00:16:56,065
This place is crawling with cops and
the cute one over there is totally...

278
00:16:56,133 --> 00:16:57,395
What ?

279
00:16:57,467 --> 00:17:00,368
Sam just called. He's delivering a baby.

280
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:04,965
He is ? What's with all the births today ?
It's like Babypalooza.

281
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:07,134
How does he get into these things ?

282
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:09,906
- I should just mind my own business.
- About Sam ?

283
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:14,280
Yeah, about Sam.
And about you "on <i>fuego."</i>

284
00:17:14,351 --> 00:17:18,651
And Pete. You all just leap.

285
00:17:18,722 --> 00:17:21,213
And you are a thinker.

286
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,816
So what do you think ?

287
00:17:24,694 --> 00:17:28,061
About me and Pete ? Come on, Nai.

288
00:17:29,699 --> 00:17:31,564
You're my friend.

289
00:17:32,235 --> 00:17:34,931
OK. Fine.

290
00:17:35,005 --> 00:17:38,168
You say you want change
and you pick Pete ?

291
00:17:38,275 --> 00:17:42,939
What, a cute doctor boy with nice eyes ?
That's not change. That's your MO.

292
00:17:43,013 --> 00:17:45,573
You're just rushing into something new.

293
00:17:45,682 --> 00:17:47,115
I'm not.

294
00:17:47,184 --> 00:17:52,622
I'm making a decision, uh, to take
a chance on something that feels right.

295
00:17:52,689 --> 00:17:55,351
- Because you're afraid to be alone.
- What if I am ?

296
00:17:55,425 --> 00:17:58,986
Surprise, Naomi.
I'm susceptible to the human condition.

297
00:17:59,062 --> 00:18:01,530
Look, there are other men.

298
00:18:01,598 --> 00:18:04,965
There are men in uniform
that I can not be alone with right now.

299
00:18:05,068 --> 00:18:09,528
I did not pick Pete because I'm
desperate and lonely. Pete is my choice.

300
00:18:09,606 --> 00:18:11,335
[Sighing]

301
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:17,076
You asked.

302
00:18:17,147 --> 00:18:21,379
- [Moaning]
- Are you OK ?

303
00:18:21,451 --> 00:18:23,112
- The baby's coming now.
- What ?

304
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:26,713
- No. Are you sure ? I mean...
- It's coming.

305
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,348
You have to catch the baby.

306
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:32,354
OK.

307
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:36,390
No, no. I can't do this.
I have to call Naomi.

308
00:18:36,466 --> 00:18:38,627
Now would be a good time.

309
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:41,595
Naomi.

310
00:18:41,671 --> 00:18:44,105
Your contractions
are five minutes apart.

311
00:18:44,174 --> 00:18:46,904
So it won't be too much longer.

312
00:18:46,977 --> 00:18:48,342
I'm ready.

313
00:18:48,445 --> 00:18:51,903
You really are, Susan.
You are totally prepared for this.

314
00:18:51,982 --> 00:18:53,540
Oh, God.

315
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,753
Today. My son's birthday is today.

316
00:19:05,629 --> 00:19:08,291
- What are you doing ?
- Timing your contractions.

317
00:19:08,365 --> 00:19:10,856
- You've been having pain long ?
- Since I got up.

318
00:19:10,934 --> 00:19:12,367
What were you thinking ?

319
00:19:12,435 --> 00:19:15,598
That I need to rob a convenience store
because I have no money

320
00:19:15,705 --> 00:19:18,606
for diapers or food
or to put a roof over my baby's head !

321
00:19:18,675 --> 00:19:22,042
That's not a reason ! Normal people
don't hold up stores, Kelly !

322
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:27,372
Kelly ? So you two
didn't just meet today, did you ?

323
00:19:27,784 --> 00:19:31,845
- That's my baby you're delivering.
- [Groaning] OK, OK, OK.

324
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:37,226
- Dell.
- It just happened.

325
00:19:37,294 --> 00:19:39,854
That was the fastest delivery
I've ever seen !

326
00:19:39,963 --> 00:19:41,055
[Naomi] OK. All right.

327
00:19:41,131 --> 00:19:44,999
First, what we're going to do is,
we're going to cut the umbilical cord.

328
00:19:45,068 --> 00:19:48,401
All right. See, right here.
See ? About half an inch.

329
00:19:48,471 --> 00:19:51,736
There we go. Yeah.
And keep the baby low for me.

330
00:19:51,808 --> 00:19:56,245
- There you go. All right. There you go.
- How is she ?

331
00:19:56,313 --> 00:19:58,281
Oh, she's great. She's great.

332
00:19:58,381 --> 00:20:00,941
She's... Oh ! She's a boy.

333
00:20:02,585 --> 00:20:05,213
Congratulations. It's a boy !

334
00:20:06,523 --> 00:20:10,789
No ! You shove that boy back up there
and pull out a girl !

335
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,192
[Baby wailing]

336
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:18,623
One girl. Is that too much to ask ?

337
00:20:18,702 --> 00:20:21,603
Your ultrasound was quite a while ago

338
00:20:21,671 --> 00:20:24,504
and misinterpretations can happen
that early on.

339
00:20:24,574 --> 00:20:28,340
I bought a little pink dress with
some pink shoes for a little pink girl.

340
00:20:29,512 --> 00:20:32,845
And I'm not leaving
until I get some pinkness !

341
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,648
Kelly, I need you
to take slow, deep breaths.

342
00:20:39,723 --> 00:20:41,350
Babies take money, Damon !

343
00:20:41,424 --> 00:20:43,654
You think I wasn't going to turn you in ?

344
00:20:43,727 --> 00:20:46,890
You think I'd let you rob
the place I work and not turn you in ?

345
00:20:46,963 --> 00:20:48,988
- You owe me !
- You're crazy !

346
00:20:49,065 --> 00:20:52,831
I'm not crazy, I'm hormonal.
Tell him I'm hormonal.

347
00:20:52,936 --> 00:20:56,099
I think that, maybe,
there's a new word for what you are.

348
00:21:00,043 --> 00:21:02,511
I couldn't raise this baby on my own !

349
00:21:02,579 --> 00:21:05,605
You wouldn't give me any money,
so I had to come and take it !

350
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:09,618
- You left me with nothing !
- Why do you think I took this job ?

351
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:13,383
I told you
I'm going to take care of this baby.

352
00:21:14,657 --> 00:21:18,559
- But you left me.
- Yes, I left you !

353
00:21:18,628 --> 00:21:21,256
But I won't leave our baby. Let me help.

354
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:28,501
I have to just say,
it sounds like Damon's an OK guy,

355
00:21:28,571 --> 00:21:31,267
- so maybe you should...
- Stay back ! Stay back !

356
00:21:31,341 --> 00:21:34,902
- OK, everybody stop ! Just stop.
- [Groaning]

357
00:21:34,978 --> 00:21:39,745
We... are going to listen
to the lady with the gun.

358
00:21:39,816 --> 00:21:43,718
- I can't take it.
- Does everybody understand ?

359
00:21:43,787 --> 00:21:46,449
Keep taking those long,
slow, deep breaths, OK ?

360
00:21:46,523 --> 00:21:48,821
[Breathes deeply]

361
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:50,985
[Sam] There we go. There we go.

362
00:21:51,761 --> 00:21:54,093
Ashley Minnehan will not
bond with this baby.

363
00:21:54,164 --> 00:21:55,529
She was expecting a girl.

364
00:21:55,598 --> 00:21:58,362
And she's at risk
for postpartum depression.

365
00:21:58,435 --> 00:21:59,993
- Can you talk to her ?
- Sure.

366
00:22:00,103 --> 00:22:02,469
Let me make sure
Susan's ready for me to go.

367
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,308
- My place, 8 :00.
- Done.

368
00:22:13,383 --> 00:22:15,613
I can't raise four boys on my own.

369
00:22:15,685 --> 00:22:19,052
Well, you have your husband.
He can help.

370
00:22:19,122 --> 00:22:23,149
Yeah, sure. Yesterday he taught the boys
how to burp the national anthem.

371
00:22:23,226 --> 00:22:24,386
Not the right help.

372
00:22:24,461 --> 00:22:27,897
I'm the only one
who puts batteries in the smoke alarm.

373
00:22:27,964 --> 00:22:31,661
The one who puts the cover
on the swimming pool at night.

374
00:22:31,734 --> 00:22:34,032
Have you tried talking to Patrick ?

375
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:37,971
Oh, he says I'm just being silly
because nothing bad ever happens.

376
00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:41,772
But that's only because
I make sure nothing bad ever happens.

377
00:22:41,845 --> 00:22:44,712
Ashley, you are a great mom.

378
00:22:46,316 --> 00:22:50,616
The boys like him better than me
because he plays with them.

379
00:22:50,687 --> 00:22:55,750
I just wanted one girl,
so she could be mine.

380
00:22:56,759 --> 00:23:00,695
And then I wouldn't care so much
about having to do it all myself.

381
00:23:00,763 --> 00:23:03,926
Well, maybe you have another boy
for a reason.

382
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,833
Maybe it's because you're a great mom.

383
00:23:06,903 --> 00:23:09,667
And you're going to raise your boys
to be good men.

384
00:23:09,739 --> 00:23:12,071
And the world needs good men.

385
00:23:15,745 --> 00:23:17,838
I want a girl !

386
00:23:22,085 --> 00:23:23,211
Whoa.

387
00:23:23,286 --> 00:23:26,119
- I've been kind of a pain in the ass.
- No, you haven't.

388
00:23:26,189 --> 00:23:28,919
Yes I have. All my rules.

389
00:23:28,992 --> 00:23:32,155
But things work out better
when I don't let my mind wander.

390
00:23:32,228 --> 00:23:34,162
You have nothing to apologize for.

391
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,529
You can't really... I mean...

392
00:23:42,572 --> 00:23:45,063
There's no plan
for doing this alone, is there ?

393
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:51,909
Look, there's a room full of Jason's
friends from the force here for you.

394
00:23:51,981 --> 00:23:53,949
You could bring someone in.

395
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:57,019
They don't get how lonely it is
since he died.

396
00:23:58,254 --> 00:23:59,414
Probably not.

397
00:24:02,792 --> 00:24:05,556
I lost my wife a while ago.

398
00:24:06,596 --> 00:24:07,756
I'm sorry.

399
00:24:08,565 --> 00:24:10,089
It gets better.

400
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:16,262
Does it really get better ?
Or do you just bury it deeper ?

401
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:19,736
I don't know.

402
00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:21,936
Maybe it depends on how you left things.

403
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:25,711
They were good.

404
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:29,017
He was so excited about this baby.

405
00:24:31,354 --> 00:24:32,719
Hold on to that.

406
00:24:36,926 --> 00:24:38,086
Oh ! Oh !

407
00:24:38,161 --> 00:24:39,924
- Here comes another one !
- OK.

408
00:24:39,996 --> 00:24:41,224
Getting up ?

409
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:45,598
- OK. You're doing good.
- Breathe.

410
00:24:45,702 --> 00:24:48,193
[Kelly screams]

411
00:24:48,271 --> 00:24:51,638
That's it. That's it. That's good.
Just like that, Kelly. Thanks.

412
00:24:51,708 --> 00:24:53,403
Ow ! Oh, God !

413
00:24:53,476 --> 00:24:54,841
You may be fully dilated.

414
00:24:54,944 --> 00:24:56,605
- There you go.
- Is the baby OK ?

415
00:24:56,679 --> 00:24:58,704
Make it stop ! Make it stop, Dr. Phil !

416
00:24:58,781 --> 00:25:02,444
It's not Phil. It's "feel."
Feel. Like "feel good."

417
00:25:02,518 --> 00:25:04,748
- OK. Never mind.
- I want an epidural !

418
00:25:04,821 --> 00:25:08,188
Yeah, well,
we're in a convenience store, so...

419
00:25:08,291 --> 00:25:10,623
- Oh, God !
- She's in pain ! Do something !

420
00:25:10,693 --> 00:25:13,594
[Kelly breathing deeply]

421
00:25:13,663 --> 00:25:15,426
All right. Kelly, listen to me.

422
00:25:15,531 --> 00:25:19,467
All right, your mind
is a very powerful healing tool.

423
00:25:19,535 --> 00:25:24,666
So, if you can relax your mind,
you'll be able to relax your body.

424
00:25:24,741 --> 00:25:27,710
You understand what I'm saying ?
Try to relax your mind.

425
00:25:27,777 --> 00:25:31,235
I just wanted a home to raise my baby,
and now I ruined everything.

426
00:25:31,314 --> 00:25:33,942
- You're telling me to relax my mind ?
- Ow !

427
00:25:34,017 --> 00:25:35,746
[Groaning]

428
00:25:35,818 --> 00:25:36,944
Oh !

429
00:25:39,389 --> 00:25:42,483
OK. Good.
You're ready to start pushing.

430
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:43,923
Nice and easy.

431
00:25:46,929 --> 00:25:50,592
- I dropped it. I dropped the list.
- That's all right. We know what to do.

432
00:25:50,667 --> 00:25:53,500
I should have laminated it.
Why didn't I think of that ?

433
00:25:53,569 --> 00:25:56,868
- We don't need it.
- I need it. I need to get out of here.

434
00:25:56,939 --> 00:26:00,306
Susan, stay where you are.
Grab the handles if you need support.

435
00:26:00,376 --> 00:26:02,606
- Try to relax. Relax.
- No, I can't.

436
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:06,308
- I can't push.
- Yes, you can. The baby's coming.

437
00:26:06,382 --> 00:26:08,316
No ! Something's wrong, I can feel it.

438
00:26:08,384 --> 00:26:10,443
Nothing is wrong.
You're doing great.

439
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,181
Where the hell is Jason ?

440
00:26:13,356 --> 00:26:15,688
- You're in control. Just stay with it.
- No !

441
00:26:15,758 --> 00:26:18,124
He's supposed to be here !
Where is he ?

442
00:26:18,227 --> 00:26:20,195
[ ? Sia : <i>You Have Been Loved]</i>

443
00:26:20,296 --> 00:26:21,456
OK. Susan.

444
00:26:22,532 --> 00:26:26,593
Susan, this little baby is ready
to come right now. We are ready.

445
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:28,432
Just like you planned.

446
00:26:28,538 --> 00:26:30,301
No. No. He's...

447
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:35,768
Oh, my God !

448
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,248
- Try to breathe.
- My Jason.

449
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:44,049
He's dead ! He's dead !

Dead ! He's really dead !

451
00:26:49,992 --> 00:26:53,553
OK. Susan.
Susan, when you hyperventilate,

452
00:26:53,629 --> 00:26:55,597
you lower the baby's heart rate.

453
00:26:55,665 --> 00:26:59,431
If we don't start pushing now,
there's a chance you will lose the baby.

454
00:26:59,502 --> 00:27:02,369
- Do you understand ?
- I can't. I can't.

455
00:27:04,841 --> 00:27:07,708
I didn't want to be alone !

456
00:27:07,777 --> 00:27:09,802
This wasn't my choice !

457
00:27:10,713 --> 00:27:13,841
No, I chose Jason ! I didn't want this !

458
00:27:28,331 --> 00:27:31,198
Susan. Susan.
Susan, honey. Listen to me.

459
00:27:31,267 --> 00:27:34,566
You're not alone. OK ?

460
00:27:34,637 --> 00:27:38,198
I am right here with you. OK ?

461
00:27:39,842 --> 00:27:43,744
Now, you're not alone
and we're going to push.

462
00:27:43,813 --> 00:27:45,576
Just keep breathing.

463
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:48,576
Push.

Good. Good. You're doing great !

Now let's bring your son out here, OK ?
All right.

Oh, God ! Please, please,
please, please, please ! Oh, God !

470
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,264
- I can help.
- You stay back !

471
00:28:12,341 --> 00:28:15,902
- You want to kill me ? Then kill me !
- No, no. We don't have to go there.

472
00:28:16,012 --> 00:28:18,981
- We don't have to go there.
- I'm not gonna leave our baby !

473
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:21,242
Hey, man ! Sit down, sit down.

474
00:28:21,317 --> 00:28:25,014
Kelly. I've got news for you.

475
00:28:25,087 --> 00:28:28,250
You tried to rob
a convenience store today.

476
00:28:28,324 --> 00:28:31,816
When this is all done, you're going
to have to answer to the cops.

477
00:28:31,894 --> 00:28:37,059
And they're probably going to try
and take your baby away from you.

478
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:39,829
But I think that, maybe, you're lucky

479
00:28:39,902 --> 00:28:43,599
because your baby's father,

480
00:28:43,673 --> 00:28:47,439
he really wants
to take care of your child.

481
00:28:47,543 --> 00:28:48,805
No, he left me.

482
00:28:51,214 --> 00:28:56,652
If you want what's best for your baby,
you got to put down that gun.

483
00:28:58,788 --> 00:29:01,154
I can't. You'll call the cops.

484
00:29:01,224 --> 00:29:02,885
I'm not going to call the cops.

485
00:29:04,894 --> 00:29:06,862
You're going to have to trust me.

486
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:10,959
Can you trust me ?

487
00:29:13,736 --> 00:29:15,704
All right, put down the gun.

488
00:29:33,089 --> 00:29:35,853
OK. Now let's get this baby out.

489
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,628
- You didn't call the cops.
- No.

490
00:29:40,596 --> 00:29:42,154
I didn't call the cops.

491
00:29:45,101 --> 00:29:47,262
- All right.
- [Screaming]

492
00:29:50,206 --> 00:29:53,039
Time to see my new boy ?
How awesome is that ?

493
00:29:53,109 --> 00:29:54,371
Another little dude !

494
00:29:54,443 --> 00:29:57,207
He's with the nurse right now
getting cleaned up.

495
00:29:59,782 --> 00:30:01,943
Is something wrong ?

496
00:30:05,821 --> 00:30:10,656
- You need to grow up.
- I'm sorry ? You don't...

497
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:13,786
