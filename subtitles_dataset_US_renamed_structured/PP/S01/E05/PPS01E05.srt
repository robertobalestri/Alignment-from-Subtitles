[ ? Sergio Mendes & Brasil '66 :
<i>Mas Que Nada]</i>

2
00:00:03,038 --> 00:00:04,300
Hey.

3
00:00:04,373 --> 00:00:06,068
Hey.

4
00:00:16,752 --> 00:00:18,617
This isn't good.

5
00:00:18,687 --> 00:00:22,646
- You being here.
- You want me to take the stairs ?

6
00:00:22,758 --> 00:00:24,783
Working together. I...

7
00:00:25,761 --> 00:00:29,094
I can't focus. I can't think.

8
00:00:29,164 --> 00:00:31,997
- Really ?
- It's...

9
00:00:33,635 --> 00:00:35,159
...your red hair.

10
00:00:37,873 --> 00:00:41,331
- And your brain.
- I am very smart.

11
00:00:43,378 --> 00:00:47,144
I barely notice your incredible breasts.

12
00:00:47,249 --> 00:00:49,979
Or your cellulite-free thighs.

13
00:00:50,052 --> 00:00:52,714
Because your brain
is such an immense turn-on

14
00:00:52,788 --> 00:00:54,847
to a man as highly evolved
as I am.

15
00:00:55,357 --> 00:00:59,487
Yes. I can see
how I might turn you on.

16
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:17,342
Pete ? Pete is your dream guy ?

17
00:01:17,412 --> 00:01:19,676
Maya ! You're going to be late !

18
00:01:19,748 --> 00:01:22,683
Friend spent the night,
which I never do on a school night,

19
00:01:22,751 --> 00:01:24,616
but I'm trying to be the fun parent.

20
00:01:24,686 --> 00:01:28,816
He's not my dream guy, OK ?
I had a dream about him last night.

21
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,755
And the night before that.

22
00:01:30,826 --> 00:01:34,057
- And the night before that.
- OK. Maya !

23
00:01:34,129 --> 00:01:37,621
I can do dreams.
It's just these particular dreams...

24
00:01:37,699 --> 00:01:40,463
...making me incredibly...
- Do not sleep with Pete.

25
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:43,265
I don't want to sleep with Pete !
My head wants to !

26
00:01:43,338 --> 00:01:45,704
It's not your head
that wants to. Maya !

27
00:01:45,807 --> 00:01:48,332
I'm right here, Mom. God.

28
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,469
Hi, Auntie Addison. This is Ruby.

29
00:01:51,446 --> 00:01:54,540
You didn't... How long have you two
been standing there ?

30
00:01:54,616 --> 00:01:57,050
Why ? What are you guys talking about ?

31
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,882
- Shoes.
- Shoes.

32
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,593
Hey, Pete.

33
00:02:09,331 --> 00:02:11,390
You guys killed at the Millrose Games.

34
00:02:11,466 --> 00:02:13,730
I was hoping you could
take a look at Nic.

35
00:02:13,802 --> 00:02:16,737
Hey, Nic ! She's got a cold,
doesn't want to see a doctor,

36
00:02:16,805 --> 00:02:19,774
she's afraid taking something
will mess her up.

37
00:02:20,542 --> 00:02:22,908
My stride felt off,
I got nothing left at the end.

38
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:26,310
Nic, this is Pete Wilder, the doctor
who helped me with my back.

39
00:02:26,381 --> 00:02:29,612
I've seen you here. It's a chest cold.
I don't need a doctor.

40
00:02:29,684 --> 00:02:32,517
- Pete does holistic medicine.
- I can treat without meds.

41
00:02:32,587 --> 00:02:35,078
Stop by later today,
we'll see what's going on.

42
00:02:35,157 --> 00:02:37,921
OK. Want to race ?

43
00:02:37,993 --> 00:02:39,017
Uh...

44
00:02:39,094 --> 00:02:41,562
No. You go ahead.

45
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:48,860
OK. I think we all have a pretty full
day. So let's make this one quick, OK ?

46
00:02:48,937 --> 00:02:53,101
Let me mention quickly, that Dell is
doing his first solo Pap smear today.

47
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:55,642
- We should all be proud.
- [Cheering]

48
00:02:56,912 --> 00:02:59,608
It's just Pap smears. No big deal.

49
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:03,014
Don't choke, it might seem dark
and scary in there, but I think...

50
00:03:03,084 --> 00:03:07,453
Do not mock the midwife.
Next order of business.

51
00:03:07,522 --> 00:03:09,683
- Nicole Clemmons is coming in.
- The runner ?

52
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:14,660
Says she has a cold, but I heard
wheezing. I ordered pulmonary tests...

53
00:03:15,964 --> 00:03:17,226
Why do you look so...

54
00:03:18,967 --> 00:03:20,696
You look hot.

55
00:03:24,072 --> 00:03:26,905
I... do I ?

56
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:30,935
No, I mean you look hot.

57
00:03:31,012 --> 00:03:35,779
As in flushed, overheated.

58
00:03:40,155 --> 00:03:42,919
Um, the next order of business ?

59
00:03:51,967 --> 00:03:53,696
You're fantasizing about Pete ?

60
00:03:54,469 --> 00:03:57,996
- Naomi !
- She's a licensed professional.

61
00:03:58,073 --> 00:04:01,099
I do not need professional help.

62
00:04:19,294 --> 00:04:22,058
- William Jefferson Clinton.
- Huh ?

63
00:04:22,163 --> 00:04:26,429
It's 2010. Bill and Hillary
have grown apart.

64
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:29,766
It's nothing he did.
Just... it happens.

65
00:04:30,438 --> 00:04:33,601
We inexplicably run into each other
at the Lincoln Memorial

66
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:37,200
- and it's very late at night.
- Oh, my God.

67
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:41,716
He recognizes something in me,
something that makes him feel whole.

68
00:04:41,783 --> 00:04:45,241
Some talk about the Camp David Summit,

69
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:50,053
some chat about how we can't possibly
and the Secret Service is...

70
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:54,084
And the next thing you know, I have
a Presidential library in Little Rock,

71
00:04:54,195 --> 00:04:58,222
and there's a legendary picture of me
and Bill laughing

72
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,530
and sharing sections of the <i>Times</i>

73
00:05:00,602 --> 00:05:05,369
while our child plays
under the dinner table. And...

74
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:09,472
...orgasm.

75
00:05:10,211 --> 00:05:12,679
You're really over Allan, aren't you ?

76
00:05:12,747 --> 00:05:14,840
Oh, I got Bill now. Bill's all I need.

77
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:17,407
So you don't think about someone real ?

78
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:20,181
Oh, Bill's real. Bill is very real.

79
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:24,089
Not Pete real. Not in the office real.

80
00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:29,290
My point is : Whatever helps you
scratch the itch is fine.

81
00:05:29,864 --> 00:05:31,832
- Oh, I don't do that.
- What ?

82
00:05:31,933 --> 00:05:33,457
[Cell phone rings]

83
00:05:34,336 --> 00:05:35,894
Hello ?

84
00:05:38,006 --> 00:05:39,530
Uh-huh.

85
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:43,509
Yeah. OK. I will be right there.

86
00:05:45,413 --> 00:05:46,778
OK.

87
00:05:46,881 --> 00:05:49,247
I got to go. I'll see you later.

88
00:05:52,754 --> 00:05:54,585
She doesn't do that ?

89
00:05:56,858 --> 00:06:00,817
- If you have any pains, let me know.
- A patient of yours is in the ER...

90
00:06:00,895 --> 00:06:04,228
Beth Burton. Somebody broke
into her house. She said she's hurt.

91
00:06:04,299 --> 00:06:08,736
Her husband flew back from a business
trip. He'll meet you at the hospital.

92
00:06:13,608 --> 00:06:16,543
- Is she going to be OK, though ?
- It wasn't that bad.

93
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:18,169
The man...

94
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:21,737
I came down the stairs,
I saw him there.

95
00:06:21,816 --> 00:06:25,843
And he got spooked and took off. And I
tripped and fell onto the glass table.

96
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,480
Well, that's a pretty bad cut.

97
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,217
We're going to need a CT.

98
00:06:33,027 --> 00:06:35,962
I'll call your mom.
Go check on the kids, OK ?

99
00:06:36,364 --> 00:06:38,525
OK.

100
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:44,231
Pretty frightening.

101
00:06:45,173 --> 00:06:47,266
It could have been so much worse.

102
00:06:54,182 --> 00:06:56,514
Bill. Bill ?

103
00:06:56,584 --> 00:06:57,915
[Gasps]

104
00:06:57,986 --> 00:07:00,921
- Naomi cannot keep a secret.
- OK, OK, OK.

105
00:07:00,989 --> 00:07:02,547
First, who are you to talk ?

106
00:07:02,624 --> 00:07:06,754
Second of all, did you notice
who I wasn't talking about ?

107
00:07:07,595 --> 00:07:10,257
- Allan. Hey !
- I'm telling you.

108
00:07:10,331 --> 00:07:12,458
I am over the hump.

109
00:07:12,534 --> 00:07:15,230
Hey, were you expecting Allan ?
Because he's here.

110
00:07:15,303 --> 00:07:17,203
OK, that's not funny.

111
00:07:17,272 --> 00:07:19,365
You hear me talking about Allan

112
00:07:19,441 --> 00:07:22,308
and you want to mess me up,
Pap smear boy.

113
00:07:22,377 --> 00:07:27,076
No. He's here.
Allan's... in the lobby here.

114
00:07:33,354 --> 00:07:34,912
You tell him to get lost.

115
00:07:34,989 --> 00:07:37,753
It's like he has Spidey sense.
Every time you split up,

116
00:07:37,859 --> 00:07:40,623
- the exact moment you breathe again...
- Violet ?

117
00:07:43,965 --> 00:07:46,934
- Coop. Hey.
- Al. Hey.

118
00:07:48,636 --> 00:07:50,001
Do you have a minute ?

119
00:07:50,071 --> 00:07:52,631
- You have patients.
- I have patients.

120
00:07:52,707 --> 00:07:56,074
Right. Yeah, it's the middle
of the work day.

121
00:07:56,144 --> 00:07:58,442
I was just...

122
00:07:58,513 --> 00:08:02,950
I was thinking about you. And...

123
00:08:03,017 --> 00:08:05,918
Another time maybe.

124
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:12,121
- Good girl.
- Allan. I have a minute.

125
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:23,694
Maya ?

126
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:36,276
What's with the stealth call
and hiding ?

127
00:08:36,384 --> 00:08:39,444
- Aren't you supposed to be in school ?
- Did you tell my mom ?

128
00:08:39,521 --> 00:08:41,682
Not yet.

129
00:08:41,756 --> 00:08:45,055
- What's the emergency ?
- It's... We think...

130
00:08:45,126 --> 00:08:48,892
- I mean, I think that...
- Maya totally has a disease.

131
00:08:48,963 --> 00:08:52,865
A disease ? What kind of disease ?

132
00:08:52,934 --> 00:08:55,960
Tell her, Maya.

133
00:08:56,037 --> 00:08:59,200
I'm pretty sure I have gonorrhea.

134
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:20,919
Hey.

135
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:23,554
John went to fill out
some insurance forms.

136
00:09:23,631 --> 00:09:26,862
Your CTs are negative. How you doing ?

137
00:09:26,935 --> 00:09:28,800
- Cold.
- Yeah.

138
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,600
OK. Dr. Bennett ?

139
00:09:31,673 --> 00:09:33,538
Um...

140
00:09:33,608 --> 00:09:37,567
I saw something on the news
about this drug.

141
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:40,079
They said it worked for some
Katrina victims.

142
00:09:40,148 --> 00:09:44,278
- What kind of drug ?
- It makes you forget what happened.

143
00:09:44,352 --> 00:09:47,981
- Is it real ?
- I... I've never heard of it.

144
00:09:48,056 --> 00:09:52,891
What I went through,
I know wasn't that bad.

145
00:09:52,961 --> 00:09:55,725
But John's away on business a lot,

146
00:09:55,830 --> 00:10:00,392
and I'm just afraid I'll never get
another good night's sleep.

147
00:10:01,703 --> 00:10:03,864
OK. I'll look into it.

148
00:10:03,972 --> 00:10:07,271
Please. And don't tell John.

149
00:10:07,342 --> 00:10:10,573
I don't want him thinking he can
never leave me alone again.

150
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,675
Gonorrhea, that's the good STD, right ?

151
00:10:17,752 --> 00:10:20,516
- You just give me pills and it's gone ?
- No.

152
00:10:20,622 --> 00:10:22,783
I need to do a full pelvic exam.

153
00:10:22,857 --> 00:10:24,324
- But...
- There's no buts.

154
00:10:24,392 --> 00:10:27,088
I won't know if it's gonorrhea
until I check you out.

155
00:10:27,161 --> 00:10:30,130
And I also need to rule out Chlamydia.

156
00:10:30,231 --> 00:10:34,497
Besides,
if you're engaging in sex,

157
00:10:34,569 --> 00:10:38,061
you need regular checkups.
It's the responsible way to behave.

158
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:42,098
Although I don't expect you
to be responsible at 13, Maya !

159
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:47,079
Honey, look at me.

160
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:51,710
Are you... Are you OK ?

161
00:10:52,487 --> 00:10:54,250
Did you do this because a boy...

162
00:10:54,322 --> 00:10:56,483
Are you being pressured ? Because...

163
00:10:56,591 --> 00:10:58,616
I'm not a little kid.

164
00:11:04,699 --> 00:11:07,827
Mrs. Worth is here for her yearly.
This is the one I'm doing ?

165
00:11:07,902 --> 00:11:10,837
- It's Pap time. Get papping.
- You don't want to be there ?

166
00:11:10,905 --> 00:11:13,874
Just ask her if she wants
a female chaperone present

167
00:11:13,975 --> 00:11:17,411
before you lay a finger on her.
Relax. Patients can smell fear.

168
00:11:17,478 --> 00:11:20,811
Keep the speculum warm,
tell the patients what you're doing

169
00:11:20,882 --> 00:11:24,818
before you do it. And introduce
yourself. Doctors always forget that.

170
00:11:24,886 --> 00:11:27,980
I aced bedside manner.
I'll give a happy pap, no worries.

171
00:11:28,056 --> 00:11:30,786
- Good. Where's Sam ?
- He had to go to the hospital.

172
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:33,827
- Naomi's in the back ?
- I don't need help ?

173
00:11:33,928 --> 00:11:35,293
You're going to be fine.

174
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,328
I can do it myself.

175
00:11:39,801 --> 00:11:41,894
Hello, I'm Dell Parker.
I'll be doing...

176
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:44,494
No, get checked napkins,
the red and white kind.

177
00:11:44,572 --> 00:11:48,668
- They told me I was getting a nurse.
- I am. I have my nursing degree

178
00:11:48,743 --> 00:11:52,201
- and I'm about to be certified as...
- They sent me a boy nurse.

179
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,645
I know.

180
00:11:53,748 --> 00:11:57,809
Excuse me. I need to ask if you'd like
a female chaperone present for the exam ?

181
00:11:57,885 --> 00:12:01,150
No. Just do it. I got to pick up
my daughter from ballet.

182
00:12:01,222 --> 00:12:03,713
Right... OK.

183
00:12:04,525 --> 00:12:06,891
I don't know. He's like five years old.

184
00:12:06,961 --> 00:12:11,091
- Yeah.
- Let me just get this for you.

185
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:14,692
- OK. OK, OK, OK.
- He just dropped the thing.

186
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:16,031
OK. That happens.

187
00:12:16,104 --> 00:12:19,437
- The thing ! Yeah.
- OK. Let's do this.

188
00:12:19,507 --> 00:12:23,034
- You're not going to use that !
- No. A new one. I'm getting a new one.

189
00:12:23,111 --> 00:12:24,976
Getting a new one.

190
00:12:25,046 --> 00:12:27,776
OK, not a happy pap.
Not a happy pap.

191
00:12:29,684 --> 00:12:33,643
- [Monitor beeping]
- [Breathing heavily]

192
00:12:35,623 --> 00:12:39,457
It looks like you're working hard.
This pace should be a piece of cake.

193
00:12:39,527 --> 00:12:41,461
I got an audience.

194
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:44,725
Wanted to see Nicole Clemmons
run in person, once,

195
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:47,927
before she's on my Wheaties box.

196
00:12:48,002 --> 00:12:49,867
I've done some marathons.

197
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:53,395
Nicole, this is Dr. Charlotte King,
she does marathons.

198
00:12:56,711 --> 00:12:58,872
[Rapid beeping]

199
00:12:59,781 --> 00:13:02,614
- Uh, you should stop.
- I just got to push through.

200
00:13:02,683 --> 00:13:04,947
Bad idea. Get off.

201
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:05,986
Stop !

202
00:13:13,928 --> 00:13:17,694
They've been in there way too long.
They are not getting back together.

203
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:18,959
No.

204
00:13:23,905 --> 00:13:25,566
[Whispers] Good to see you.

205
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:30,368
Friends.

206
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,941
- What ?
- Allan. He just wants to be friends.

207
00:13:34,015 --> 00:13:37,143
- We're having coffee.
- [Sighs] Come on, Violet.

208
00:13:37,218 --> 00:13:39,948
Sometimes friends can mean just friends.

209
00:13:40,021 --> 00:13:42,649
- Look at me and Naomi.
- You two are so not friends.

210
00:13:42,723 --> 00:13:44,486
- You guys are...
- A corporation.

211
00:13:44,592 --> 00:13:47,561
We are handling a tough situation
with maturity.

212
00:13:47,662 --> 00:13:51,928
He apologized for hurting me.
He just misses our conversations.

213
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:55,765
Allan always blows in, he makes you feel
all good and then he hurts you worse

214
00:13:55,837 --> 00:13:57,304
and I pick up the pieces.

215
00:13:57,371 --> 00:14:00,738
Sorry to interrupt.
I need... Could I get...

216
00:14:00,842 --> 00:14:03,402
- I need to borrow you for a consult.
- Gladly.

217
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:06,203
Get help.

218
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,305
Hey... I...

219
00:14:08,983 --> 00:14:12,146
Allan wants to be friends.
That's healthy. We're moving on.

220
00:14:12,253 --> 00:14:15,222
If Cooper doesn't have to listen to it,
then neither do I.

221
00:14:15,323 --> 00:14:17,587
Now, I have this patient, Beth Burton,

222
00:14:17,658 --> 00:14:21,287
she interrupted a robbery in her home,
and she's interested in a drug

223
00:14:21,362 --> 00:14:24,525
- used on post-traumatic stress.
- Propranolol, beta blocker ?

224
00:14:24,599 --> 00:14:27,659
- So then it's for real ?
- Uh... It's controversial.

225
00:14:27,735 --> 00:14:28,997
But, yeah. It's real.

226
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:32,437
It blunts physical response to
the memory consolidation of trauma.

227
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,805
- So then you don't actually forget.
- It more, um...

228
00:14:35,877 --> 00:14:38,573
...lessens the fear and
panic when you do remember.

229
00:14:38,646 --> 00:14:41,342
Will you talk to her,
make sure she's a candidate ?

230
00:14:41,415 --> 00:14:44,179
- Yeah, sure.
- All right. Thank you.

231
00:14:44,252 --> 00:14:46,880
Hey, Sam ? Um...

232
00:14:46,954 --> 00:14:50,219
If I were to wear a skirt
to have coffee with Allan,

233
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,384
would that mean,
"I want to get with you ?"

234
00:14:53,427 --> 00:14:57,124
Not that I want that !
I'm asking because I don't.

235
00:14:58,165 --> 00:15:01,100
Little Maya ?
Little, sweet, innocent Maya.

236
00:15:01,168 --> 00:15:04,831
From the Christmas card. The onesie
with the pacifier and the drool !

237
00:15:04,906 --> 00:15:07,204
Sweet, innocent drool !

238
00:15:07,275 --> 00:15:09,334
- God knows where that's been.
- Why me ?

239
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:12,573
Why did Maya have to come to me ?

240
00:15:12,647 --> 00:15:17,516
Poor Naomi. I just ran
an STD test on her 13-year-old !

241
00:15:17,585 --> 00:15:18,677
How do I tell her that ?

242
00:15:18,753 --> 00:15:22,382
California has strict patient
confidentiality laws for minors.

243
00:15:22,456 --> 00:15:24,151
I know.

244
00:15:24,225 --> 00:15:27,388
But how can I keep something
like this from Sam and Naomi ?

245
00:15:27,461 --> 00:15:31,090
- She's everything to them.
- Maya doesn't need you to tell them.

246
00:15:31,165 --> 00:15:36,432
What she needs is someone she can trust.
Maya could use a friend right now.

247
00:15:36,504 --> 00:15:40,065
So you be her friend, Addison.
You give her what her parents can't.

248
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,401
Nicole, you have severe bronchospasm.

249
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:47,913
Your oxygen levels
are dropping when you run.

250
00:15:47,982 --> 00:15:50,473
You need inhaled steroids
and continuous nebs.

251
00:15:50,551 --> 00:15:53,714
I can't use those ! I have
national championships coming up !

252
00:15:53,821 --> 00:15:56,790
I know you want herbs,
but at this point you have no choice.

253
00:15:56,891 --> 00:15:59,223
You cannot compete
until you control this.

254
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:01,818
- What ?
- If you listen to Dr. Wilder,

255
00:16:01,896 --> 00:16:06,799
let him get you stabilized,
you will race again, but not yet.

256
00:16:06,867 --> 00:16:10,325
- This is an Olympic qualifying meet !
- The condition you're in ?

257
00:16:10,404 --> 00:16:14,568
If you run too hard, push too hard,
if you even walk too hard,

258
00:16:14,642 --> 00:16:16,132
you could die.

259
00:16:33,527 --> 00:16:35,085
- Here she is.
- Good morning.

260
00:16:35,196 --> 00:16:36,527
- Hey.
- Hey.

261
00:16:36,597 --> 00:16:38,258
- Just ask her.
- OK.

262
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:44,464
What did you mean the other day
when you said you..."don't do that ?"

263
00:16:44,538 --> 00:16:46,904
That... I don't do that.

264
00:16:46,974 --> 00:16:51,604
You don't...
You actually do not...

265
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:54,944
You physically,
actually, do not do that ?

266
00:16:55,016 --> 00:16:57,849
- I don't do that.
- I feel like she's speaking Czech.

267
00:16:57,918 --> 00:16:59,886
- Or Mandarin.
- I'm not a prude.

268
00:16:59,954 --> 00:17:02,320
It's just... I'm from Connecticut.

269
00:17:02,423 --> 00:17:05,688
And besides, for me,
sex is a two player game.

270
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,820
Solo doesn't cut it for me.
You know what I'm talking about.

271
00:17:08,896 --> 00:17:10,557
Showerhead massager.

272
00:17:11,265 --> 00:17:15,964
What about Maya ? I mean,
I would think as a mother...

273
00:17:16,037 --> 00:17:19,495
A mother with a very expensive
showerhead massager.

274
00:17:19,573 --> 00:17:22,940
First, self-pleasure
is a feminine right.

275
00:17:23,044 --> 00:17:26,013
As a single woman, sex cannot
always be a two-player game,

276
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,514
you get desperate
and play with the wrong guy.

277
00:17:28,582 --> 00:17:31,016
Pete. Pete is the wrong guy.

278
00:17:31,085 --> 00:17:34,452
Except in her fantasies, he's fine.
You know, do him in dreamland.

279
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:37,319
So you're saying,
to avoid having sex with Pete,

280
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:39,416
I need to have "sex" with Pete ?

281
00:17:39,493 --> 00:17:42,553
No, you need to have sex with yourself.

282
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,996
Pete is more just like
a helping hand.

283
00:17:45,066 --> 00:17:47,398
Please stop talking.

284
00:17:47,468 --> 00:17:51,029
- Uh... Beth Burton is here.
- Yes, I'm coming right away.

285
00:17:53,441 --> 00:17:56,604
- We were just...
- Ah. No. Don't... Don't explain.

286
00:17:56,677 --> 00:17:58,941
I don't... I...

287
00:18:00,514 --> 00:18:03,244
- He's going to tell Pete.
- He's going to tell Pete.

288
00:18:04,785 --> 00:18:06,343
Hey, um...

289
00:18:06,454 --> 00:18:10,322
How's, uh... How's Maya doing ?

290
00:18:10,391 --> 00:18:14,350
I mean, she seems so grown-up.
After the divorce and she...

291
00:18:14,462 --> 00:18:17,693
Actually, I think she kind of digs
having divorced parents.

292
00:18:17,765 --> 00:18:22,259
You know, like, two houses and double
the clothes, you know. She's good.

293
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,530
Right.

294
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:30,133
Hi.

295
00:18:30,511 --> 00:18:33,674
Are you watching ? Addison doesn't
think I can do this ? I can.

296
00:18:33,781 --> 00:18:37,342
I'm just observing.
You know, go. Do this.

297
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:38,782
OK.

298
00:18:38,853 --> 00:18:42,152
OK. So, what I'm going to do is...

299
00:18:43,023 --> 00:18:45,787
- What I'm going to do...
- You're cute.

300
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:49,227
- He's cute, right ?
- Let's just focus on the exam, OK ?

301
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:53,061
OK. So, sorry. I'm going
to tell you the names of the stuff.

302
00:18:53,134 --> 00:18:56,001
- Is he allowed to be this cute ?
- She allowed to ask me that ?

303
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,903
She is, but you're not allowed
to pay attention. Keep going.

304
00:18:58,973 --> 00:19:00,497
OK.

305
00:19:00,574 --> 00:19:04,135
No. This isn't going to work.
You're way too cute.

306
00:19:04,211 --> 00:19:08,944
[Stammering] No, no. I'm not. I'm not.
I'm ugly. I have moles in weird places.

307
00:19:09,016 --> 00:19:14,750
No. Uh-uh. I'd be having all these
thoughts about your eyes and stuff. No.

308
00:19:14,822 --> 00:19:16,380
No way you're touching me.

309
00:19:17,158 --> 00:19:19,649
Unless you want to touch me ?

310
00:19:19,727 --> 00:19:22,821
OK, Dell. I think
I can handle this one.

311
00:19:23,564 --> 00:19:25,998
I would like to try
some therapy sessions

312
00:19:26,066 --> 00:19:28,762
before we even consider
using the propranolol.

313
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:31,737
- Why can't we use the drug ?
- Even if you were to take it,

314
00:19:31,805 --> 00:19:33,966
it would involve
sessions with Violet.

315
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:36,771
I would walk you through
the details of the event

316
00:19:36,844 --> 00:19:39,176
after the drug has taken effect.

317
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:41,339
- All the details ?
- Right.

318
00:19:41,415 --> 00:19:44,976
- I... I can't do that.
- I know, it can be scary. But...

319
00:19:45,052 --> 00:19:48,544
No. No. I can't do that.

320
00:19:48,622 --> 00:19:49,714
No, wait. Beth.

321
00:19:56,964 --> 00:19:58,488
Hey.

322
00:20:00,134 --> 00:20:01,897
I got your test results back.

323
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:05,801
You don't have gonorrhea.

324
00:20:05,873 --> 00:20:09,309
Really ? Well, that's great.

325
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:12,345
But could I get some of those pills,
for the guy ?

326
00:20:12,446 --> 00:20:15,142
No. Absolutely not.
He has to see a doctor.

327
00:20:16,517 --> 00:20:19,213
Maya, can I ask...

328
00:20:19,286 --> 00:20:22,653
How long have you been having sex ?

329
00:20:24,892 --> 00:20:28,225
Well, I don't know. A year ?

330
00:20:30,864 --> 00:20:33,833
OK. A year.

331
00:20:33,934 --> 00:20:38,166
- And the boy ?
- Well, there's a couple of boys.

332
00:20:38,239 --> 00:20:40,935
A couple of boys ?
Not that I'm judging.

333
00:20:41,008 --> 00:20:43,704
Friends don't judge. Just...

334
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:49,781
It's just because you didn't get an STD
now doesn't mean you won't get one.

335
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:53,411
- Not to mention HIV, a pregnancy...
- I use condoms.

336
00:20:53,487 --> 00:20:57,014
They're not 100% effective
in preventing disease and pregnancy.

337
00:20:57,091 --> 00:21:01,528
- They're not ?
- Maya.

338
00:21:02,129 --> 00:21:04,427
Sex at your age...

339
00:21:04,498 --> 00:21:07,524
Hey. I didn't know
you were here already.

340
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:09,535
- She's not bugging you, is she ?
- No.

341
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:11,867
She's, uh... No.

342
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:14,806
I just... I just wanted
to say hi to Aunt Addison.

343
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:18,208
Well, say goodbye to Aunt Addison.
You've got violin. Come on.

344
00:21:21,548 --> 00:21:23,175
- Goodbye, Aunt Addison.
- Bye.

345
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:33,760
Beer ? Sudsy, relaxing beer ?

346
00:21:33,827 --> 00:21:37,319
Violet is having coffee
with Allan tonight.

347
00:21:37,398 --> 00:21:39,832
I deserve beer before
I wipe her off the floor.

348
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,164
I'm going to the track
to see Coach Mike.

349
00:21:42,236 --> 00:21:44,727
How'd he take
having to bench Nicole Clemmons ?

350
00:21:44,805 --> 00:21:48,070
He hasn't returned my calls.
She's the one I'm worried about,

351
00:21:48,142 --> 00:21:52,101
- if she can't race for a while.
- Maybe she doesn't know about beer.

352
00:21:52,179 --> 00:21:54,511
Have you told her about
our good friend beer ?

[Doorbell rings]

354
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:01,485
Hi.

355
00:22:01,555 --> 00:22:03,785
I left you a few messages.

356
00:22:03,857 --> 00:22:06,951
I was just on my way out
for the evening.

357
00:22:07,027 --> 00:22:10,087
I need to make sure you're OK.

358
00:22:10,164 --> 00:22:13,065
Something more happened, didn't it ?

359
00:22:13,133 --> 00:22:14,896
Than what you said.

360
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:22,706

[Man] Go ! Go !

364
00:22:34,121 --> 00:22:36,089
That's it ! Come on !

365
00:22:37,891 --> 00:22:39,654
He put his hand over my mouth

366
00:22:40,928 --> 00:22:43,988
and pushed against me
until I felt his gun.

367
00:22:44,064 --> 00:22:45,531
He had a gun ?

368
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,228
I told him just to take
what he wanted and to leave,

369
00:22:49,303 --> 00:22:51,794
but he shoved me down on the couch.

370
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,841
[Wavering] Please leave. Please leave.

371
00:22:55,909 --> 00:22:58,241
What did he do, Beth ?

372
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:00,343
[Pete] She...

373
00:23:00,414 --> 00:23:03,747
- She hasn't had any trouble breathing ?
- No.

374
00:23:03,817 --> 00:23:08,447
Look at her go.
You're a miracle worker, Pete.

375
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:11,190
I didn't do anything.

376
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:16,828
I kept calling and then I remembered
he wasn't home. I was all alone.

377
00:23:17,765 --> 00:23:20,256
It's not happening now. You're safe.

378
00:23:20,334 --> 00:23:23,428
I kicked him, hard !

379
00:23:23,504 --> 00:23:26,473
- He fell off me.
- You did ?

380
00:23:27,007 --> 00:23:32,274
I got up and he grabbed my hair
and I fell onto the table.

381
00:23:34,314 --> 00:23:35,542
My son...

382
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:39,284
I heard him wake up upstairs, crying.

383
00:23:39,353 --> 00:23:41,253
Beth ?

384
00:23:46,326 --> 00:23:47,588
That man hit you ?

385
00:23:52,499 --> 00:23:54,524
He touched you ?

386
00:23:58,405 --> 00:24:01,465
I've never seen her better.
She's about to break a record.

387
00:24:01,542 --> 00:24:03,908
- Tell her to stop.
- You kidding ? The record...

388
00:24:03,977 --> 00:24:05,342
She should stop.

389
00:24:06,113 --> 00:24:07,808
Nicole !

390
00:24:18,525 --> 00:24:22,256
He's barely said a word
since he found out. I thought, maybe,

391
00:24:22,329 --> 00:24:24,388
because he trusts you...

392
00:24:28,535 --> 00:24:30,662
It was right to tell the truth.

393
00:24:31,472 --> 00:24:35,340
It's just how he is.
He takes everything on himself.

394
00:24:35,409 --> 00:24:38,105
That man had his hands all over her.

395
00:24:38,178 --> 00:24:40,942
He touched her.
I should have been there.

396
00:24:41,048 --> 00:24:43,778
The thing you need to focus on
is your wife.

397
00:24:43,851 --> 00:24:45,318
I'm going to give notice.

398
00:24:45,385 --> 00:24:47,546
No more business trips, no more leaving.

399
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:49,417
- We're going to get a gun...
- No.

400
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:52,857
How are you ever going
to rest easy in our home ?

401
00:24:52,926 --> 00:24:55,952
- How are you ever going to feel safe ?
- Listen to me.

402
00:24:56,029 --> 00:24:59,521
OK, there's something that I can take
so I won't remember this.

403
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,661
- A drug. We do not need a gun.
- Let's go slow

404
00:25:03,737 --> 00:25:06,501
before we go to medication.

405
00:25:06,573 --> 00:25:08,871
Please. Nothing has changed.

406
00:25:08,942 --> 00:25:11,843
I don't want to feel it.
I want the drug.

Where's her family ?

408
00:25:21,388 --> 00:25:22,946
Out of the picture.

409
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:26,186
My wife and I,
we pretty much raised her.

410
00:25:28,061 --> 00:25:30,154
Excuse me. Can I talk to you ?

411
00:25:33,901 --> 00:25:37,166
What kind of snake oil
did you give that girl ?

412
00:25:37,237 --> 00:25:40,866
We found it in her bag.
She's alkaloid toxic.

413
00:25:40,941 --> 00:25:43,876
This isn't mine.

414
00:25:43,944 --> 00:25:47,072
- I'm not even sure what this is.
- Well, that's a damn shame,

415
00:25:47,147 --> 00:25:50,844
because she's your patient and
it may be what's about to kill her.

OK ? Work went late and so he came here.

- No, no. See this is what I was...

means you'll have farther to fall,

detail when this goes bad.

a relationship expert ?

I'm an expert on this relationship
because it's all I ever hear about.

It's typical for victims of
sexual assault to hide details,

was incredibly brave.

That you have the strength
to get through this. Without a pill.

496

What you're afraid of is not remembering
what happened to you that night,

you already did that.
And look. You're still standing.

What you are afraid of is not that
you're not strong enough to handle this.
