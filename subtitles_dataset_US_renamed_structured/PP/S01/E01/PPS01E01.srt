you deliver here.

- OK.

00:07:57,672 --> 00:08:01,733
OK. Let me see if I understand this.

137
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:05,302

know how many babies I deliver a day ?

- One patient, the entire day ?

143
00:08:20,862 --> 00:08:23,092
[Naomi] I told you.
We do things differently.

144
00:08:23,164 --> 00:08:27,260
This may be a big city, but this co-op
is about practicing small-town medicine.

145

Every patient is special
and gets our full attention.

146
00:08:30,238 --> 00:08:33,605
It's not about surgeries.
It's about connecting. I told you this.

147
00:08:33,675 --> 00:08:38,544
I know. I just... I didn't think it
would be one patient, the entire day ?

Get away.

- Pupil's blown. He's having a stroke.

163
00:09:25,727 --> 00:09:29,026
All right. He's had three rounds of epi
and a 200 lido bolus.

- Get out of my way. Hold CPR.

165
00:09:32,533 --> 00:09:35,866
- How long has he been down ?
- Uh... At least 20 minutes.

166
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,475
- I'm going to call it.
- What ?

167
00:09:42,543 --> 00:09:46,673
- What about the shockie things ?
- No point turning this into a show.

168
00:09:46,748 --> 00:09:48,409
No ! No ! Use the shockie things !

169
00:09:48,483 --> 00:09:51,714
- I'm sorry, he's gone.
- Time of death, 9 :42am.

170
00:09:54,355 --> 00:09:57,051
[Gasping] No.

171
00:09:57,125 --> 00:10:00,686
We were going to have a baby.
He was going to be a dad.

172
00:10:01,396 --> 00:10:03,887
[Sobbing]

173
00:10:08,636 --> 00:10:10,661
I want... I want his sperm.

174
00:10:12,807 --> 00:10:16,903
Uh... He didn't get a chance to make
his donation before he died.

175
00:10:16,978 --> 00:10:19,037
- You can take it from him now.
- [Both] What ?

176
00:10:19,113 --> 00:10:23,880
I want his sperm.
I want Ken's sperm now !

177
00:10:34,095 --> 00:10:37,121
[Violet] I get Naomi's mad.
Hell hath no fury and all that.

178
00:10:37,198 --> 00:10:40,497
I know the practice needs an ob-gyn,
but since when do we not vote ?

179
00:10:40,568 --> 00:10:42,900
I had sex with this woman last night.

180
00:10:42,971 --> 00:10:45,940
We started this practice
to be in charge of our own destiny.

181
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,736
Very real, you know, Internet sex.

182
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:50,937
But she wanted me to call her "Mama."

183
00:10:51,012 --> 00:10:54,709
But she promised
all this really freaky stuff.

184
00:10:54,782 --> 00:10:57,649
And I'm talking, like, stuff.

185
00:10:57,719 --> 00:11:00,017
OK. Ew ! That's it. I'm done.

186
00:11:00,088 --> 00:11:01,555
Come on. What ? Why ?

187
00:11:01,622 --> 00:11:04,785
Because you're a sex addict
or an Internet addict

188
00:11:04,892 --> 00:11:07,053
- or some freaky addict.
- You're a stalker.

189
00:11:07,161 --> 00:11:10,255
- Stalking your married ex-boyfriend.
- I am not.

190
00:11:10,331 --> 00:11:13,198
I'm... calling him occasionally.

191
00:11:13,267 --> 00:11:15,167
- Stalker.
- OK, that's it.

192
00:11:15,236 --> 00:11:17,670
I'm cutting you off.
You get no help from me.

193
00:11:17,739 --> 00:11:20,469
- You're getting no more help.
- I don't ask for your help.

194
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:23,408
- Oh, come on, stalker.
- I'm not a stalker !

195
00:11:24,545 --> 00:11:26,445
[Pager beeps]

196
00:11:26,514 --> 00:11:31,008
Hey. I just want to say
that I am really sorry.

197
00:11:31,085 --> 00:11:34,919
- About Naomi and the job. I...
- I got a 911 page.

198
00:11:38,359 --> 00:11:39,656
[Sighs]

199
00:11:39,727 --> 00:11:42,855
Don't mind her. She's not mad at you.
She's mad at me.

200
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,557
OK.

201
00:11:45,466 --> 00:11:48,799
Do you think there's something wrong
with having sex with a woman

202
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:52,533
who wants you to call her "Mama ?"

203
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:57,302
Oh, God, it just sounds so much worse
when I say it out loud.

204
00:11:57,812 --> 00:11:59,712
- There's a patient for you.
- Thank God.

205
00:11:59,814 --> 00:12:00,838
No, not him. You.

206
00:12:02,417 --> 00:12:04,248
I have a patient ?

207
00:12:10,792 --> 00:12:14,819
[Dell] This is Bill Henderson and his
daughter, Lucy. This is Dr. Montgomery.

208
00:12:14,896 --> 00:12:17,456
- She'll deliver your baby.
- [Groans]

209
00:12:17,532 --> 00:12:20,831
It hurts, doesn't it ? That's what
you get for getting pregnant !

210
00:12:20,902 --> 00:12:23,928
She hid it for months.
Suddenly it's "Daddy, I'm in labor."

211
00:12:24,005 --> 00:12:27,031
How about we get you
into the birthing suite ? Dell.

212
00:12:27,108 --> 00:12:29,542
- See if we have a chart.
- Can I get in on this ?

213
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,771
Don't have field experience
for training.

214
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:34,609
- How about you just find the chart ?
- [Shudders]

215
00:12:38,152 --> 00:12:39,983
Ken's sperm.

216
00:12:40,054 --> 00:12:43,717
You want us to take
Ken's sperm right out of...

217
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,622
Are you sure ?

218
00:12:46,327 --> 00:12:51,390
I'm sure. Ken would want it too.
I know he would.

219
00:12:51,466 --> 00:12:52,899
I mean, you can do it, right ?

220
00:12:52,967 --> 00:12:55,527
Look here. You're distressed,
I understand.

221
00:12:55,636 --> 00:12:59,970
Unless you have written consent, I won't
let you molest your husband's corpse.

222
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:03,204
Well, let's not use words
like "molest" or "corpse"

223
00:13:03,277 --> 00:13:06,178
about her loved one.
It's her boyfriend, not husband.

224
00:13:06,247 --> 00:13:08,215
Oh, well, fine.

225
00:13:08,282 --> 00:13:10,842
She wants sperm of a man
she has no legal rights to.

226
00:13:10,918 --> 00:13:14,217
- That makes it all better. No.
- What ?

227
00:13:14,989 --> 00:13:18,117
OK. Hey. Let's...
Can we stop, Charlotte, right ?

228
00:13:18,192 --> 00:13:21,355
You know my name, Sam.
Don't act like you don't.

229
00:13:21,429 --> 00:13:23,294
I'm chief of staff, and you know it.

230
00:13:23,364 --> 00:13:26,731
You and I,
we're on the same side here.

231
00:13:26,801 --> 00:13:28,769
I don't think this is a good idea.

232
00:13:28,836 --> 00:13:31,737
My patient died while visiting
a fertility specialist.

233
00:13:31,806 --> 00:13:35,742
- They were trying to have a baby.
- For the patient to enjoy while alive.

234
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:39,507
- Unless the girlfriend's a mantis.
- Did she call me an insect ?

235
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:43,846
- No. She didn't.
- I'm sorry. That was rude of me.

236
00:13:43,918 --> 00:13:46,887
I get my back up any time
you people in that practice of yours

237
00:13:46,988 --> 00:13:50,082
- try to bend rules in my hospital.
- We don't bend the rules.

238
00:13:50,158 --> 00:13:51,921
We just do things differently.

239
00:13:52,026 --> 00:13:55,587
You and I,
we can work on this together.

240
00:13:55,663 --> 00:13:58,757
We can figure this out.
Because I'm a good person,

241
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,858
[stammers] you're a good person.

242
00:14:00,935 --> 00:14:03,802
I mean, we can... right ?
We can... Together...

243
00:14:03,871 --> 00:14:06,601
- I did read your book, by the way.
- Oh. Great.

244
00:14:06,674 --> 00:14:09,199
I took issue with most of it.

245
00:14:13,881 --> 00:14:18,443
Now, I'm on her side. We want Ken's
sperm or you got a fight on your hands.

246
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:21,181
That man's swimmers
are staying where they are.

247
00:14:21,255 --> 00:14:23,553
You got a way to fight,
I'd like to see you try.

248
00:14:26,894 --> 00:14:29,385
I'm calling Naomi on you.

249
00:14:30,898 --> 00:14:33,560
Lucy Henderson,
my patient until she got pregnant.

250
00:14:33,634 --> 00:14:36,262
No previous medical problems.
It looks good.

251
00:14:36,337 --> 00:14:39,170
The dad is mad as hell.
I could use your help in there.

252
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,732
Oh, yeah, no.
That, down there, is not my area.

253
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:46,712
So when the baby comes out, I'd be happy
to examine it. Until then, Godspeed.

254
00:14:46,781 --> 00:14:49,113
- [Scoffs]
- Give me two secs to grab my kit.

255
00:14:49,183 --> 00:14:50,946
- I'll join you.
- For ?

256
00:14:51,052 --> 00:14:54,351
Read further in the chart,
she has a holistic birth plan.

257
00:14:54,422 --> 00:14:57,357
- Oh, my God. Are you kidding me ?
- Laboring moms love Pete.

258
00:14:58,059 --> 00:15:00,220
Hey, listen, um...

259
00:15:00,294 --> 00:15:04,560
...your moving here, it didn't have
anything to do with me kissing you ?

260
00:15:04,632 --> 00:15:06,793
- What ?
- It's OK. It's just that... well,

261
00:15:06,901 --> 00:15:09,870
- you should know, it was just a kiss.
- Wait. You think

262
00:15:09,971 --> 00:15:13,737
- I moved here because you kissed me ?
- It was a good kiss.

263
00:15:13,841 --> 00:15:18,005
- It was an excellent kiss. But...
- Stop talking ! All right ? [chuckles]

264
00:15:18,713 --> 00:15:20,874
I did not move here
because you kissed me.

265
00:15:20,948 --> 00:15:23,382
- OK.
- You are actually deranged enough

266
00:15:23,451 --> 00:15:27,547
to think that I would pick up my entire
life and move because of a kiss ?

267
00:15:27,622 --> 00:15:29,988
- Let me clear that up. I wouldn't.
- OK.

268
00:15:30,091 --> 00:15:35,028
Shut up. Just go in there and do
your little Eastern voodoo thing you do,

269
00:15:35,096 --> 00:15:38,964
and let's help that girl
have her baby in peace.

270
00:15:44,905 --> 00:15:47,271
What do you expect me to do ?
He was your patient.

271
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:51,141
My patient's dead. This is about your
patient who wants a dead man's sperm.

272
00:15:51,245 --> 00:15:53,270
- Besides, I got mad.
- You got mad ?

273
00:15:53,347 --> 00:15:54,712
- I got mad.
- You got mad ?

274
00:15:54,782 --> 00:15:57,546
Neither of us makes
good decisions when we're mad.

275
00:15:57,652 --> 00:16:00,348
Another doctor who can bill
is a very good decision.

276
00:16:00,421 --> 00:16:03,185
We agreed when we split
we would not let it affect work.

277
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:06,783
My work is fine. In fact,
watch me take care of my patient.

278
00:16:06,861 --> 00:16:10,297
Hey. Listen. We still have time, OK ?

279
00:16:10,364 --> 00:16:12,389
Get a good sample for at least 24 hours.

280
00:16:12,466 --> 00:16:15,401
I can't believe it.
He was so happy.

281
00:16:15,469 --> 00:16:17,994
I know, I know.

282
00:16:18,072 --> 00:16:22,634
I want his baby. I want to have
something of him, of us together.

283
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,610
- Please.
- All right.

284
00:16:27,481 --> 00:16:30,450
- Where are you going ?
- Hospital won't touch the body, I will.

285
00:16:30,518 --> 00:16:32,577
Lay a hand on him,
I'll have you arrested.

286
00:16:32,653 --> 00:16:37,818
I'm not a person who plays games, Naomi.
You know that. Now, please, step back.

287
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,763
- OK, now I'm mad.
- I told you.

288
00:16:52,106 --> 00:16:53,664
[Sighs]

289
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:00,805
- Hey.
- Hey. Where's Naomi ?

290
00:17:00,881 --> 00:17:03,975
- Had to get to the hospital.
- She gets to work at a hospital,

291
00:17:04,051 --> 00:17:06,212
but I don't.

292
00:17:07,221 --> 00:17:10,247
- [Addison sighs]
- [Clears throat]

293
00:17:10,324 --> 00:17:13,452
You know, I could help.
You know, with Lucy.

294
00:17:13,527 --> 00:17:17,156
Thanks. That's nice, but I'm good.

295
00:17:17,898 --> 00:17:20,196
- You don't take me seriously.
- What ?

296
00:17:20,267 --> 00:17:22,599
You think I'm some
dumb surfer boy, eye candy.

297
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:25,503
You have no respect
for me or my midwifery skills.

298
00:17:25,573 --> 00:17:28,201
I have total respect for you

299
00:17:28,275 --> 00:17:31,244
and your... midwifery skills ?

300
00:17:31,846 --> 00:17:34,610
- Is that even a word ? Midwifery ?
- It's a word.

301
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,979
It's definitely a word.

302
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,882
[Chuckles]

303
00:17:41,956 --> 00:17:44,516
[Woman counting quietly]

304
00:17:48,629 --> 00:17:49,687
Jenny ?

305
00:17:49,764 --> 00:17:54,030
She's been counting the tiles for over
an hour. Do you know this lady ?

306
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:57,694
Yes, I do.

307
00:17:58,973 --> 00:18:01,100
What the hell happened to her ?

308
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:14,720
- She had your card in her wallet.
- Well, thank you.

309
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:16,154
Thank you for calling me.

310
00:18:16,257 --> 00:18:18,555
My sister, she's got mental problems.

311
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:22,889
She's a good person,
but she's got mental problems.

312
00:18:22,963 --> 00:18:26,296
- It's why I called you before the cops.
- We don't need the police.

313
00:18:26,367 --> 00:18:28,267
- I can handle it.
- Can you do it quick ?

314
00:18:28,335 --> 00:18:31,031
She can't stay. She's obstructing
customer flow...

315
00:18:31,105 --> 00:18:33,972
If you give me some time,
I will take her out of your hair.

316
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:37,340
Can you do that for me, Paul ?
Can you do that ?

317
00:18:38,212 --> 00:18:39,839
- I guess.
- Thank you.

318
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,805
You're getting charged by the hour,
so you might as well hear me.

319
00:19:08,876 --> 00:19:10,969
- Inhale.
- [Sobs, breathes deeply]

320
00:19:11,045 --> 00:19:14,811
- Exhale. Focus on me. Exhale.
- [Exhales]

321
00:19:14,915 --> 00:19:17,281
Deep breaths. In. Out.

322
00:19:17,384 --> 00:19:20,148
- [Exhales]
- Good. Good. Much better.

323
00:19:20,254 --> 00:19:25,521
[Sighing] My dad. He's just mad.

324
00:19:25,593 --> 00:19:29,461
I want this baby.
I just... I screwed up.

325
00:19:30,831 --> 00:19:32,958
I'm such a screw-up.

326
00:19:33,033 --> 00:19:36,525
Hey. Lucy ? Listen.

327
00:19:36,604 --> 00:19:39,368
Everyone screws up once in a while.

328
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,536
And, in this room,
you get a free pass. OK ?

329
00:19:44,812 --> 00:19:46,336
OK.

330
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:53,752
These are Ken and Leslie's medical
records, including Ken's signature

331
00:19:53,821 --> 00:19:56,949
on a contract, with my office,
regarding his donation.

332
00:19:57,024 --> 00:19:59,083
Now, I think that is more than implied.

333
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:01,457
Live consent is different.

334
00:20:01,529 --> 00:20:04,692
- You're considering this ?
- It could be persuasive in court.

335
00:20:04,765 --> 00:20:08,098
You patient will sign something
indemnifying us from legal action ?

336
00:20:08,168 --> 00:20:10,329
She just wants her baby.

337
00:20:11,739 --> 00:20:15,231
Fine. You do the procedure,
you take possession of the sperm.

338
00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:16,537
Thank you for your help.

339
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,216
- Well done. Very badass.
- I know, right ?

340
00:20:23,284 --> 00:20:26,310
- Get away from me. It's good.
- [Laughs]

341
00:20:28,355 --> 00:20:30,516
- Are you Dr. Naomi Bennett ?
- I am.

342
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:32,957
Get that tramp's claws
off my husband's sperm,

343
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,187
or I'll sue so fast your head will spin.

344
00:20:35,262 --> 00:20:38,823
- Who are you ?
- I'm Ken Wilson's wife.

345
00:20:41,936 --> 00:20:46,373
Jenny ? You look very angry to me.

346
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,308
Did something happen to make
you feel out of control in the store ?

347
00:20:50,377 --> 00:20:54,404
OK. Well, we've been working on rage
directed toward your husband

348
00:20:54,481 --> 00:20:58,110
for leaving you. Are you angry ?

349
00:20:58,185 --> 00:21:01,154
That's OK. Feel the feelings.

350
00:21:01,221 --> 00:21:03,781
Get angry. Let's talk about
getting angry.

351
00:21:03,891 --> 00:21:07,952
- She's not answering.
- Yeah, I got that, Paul.

352
00:21:08,028 --> 00:21:11,486
What's the deal ? She gets upset so
she goes crazy with the counting ?

353
00:21:11,565 --> 00:21:14,796
Well, for many people, counting
establishes a sense of order.

354
00:21:14,868 --> 00:21:16,699
Oh, my God. When did my knees turn 80 ?

355
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:21,901
- We got kneepads on aisle eight.
- I'm not gonna be here much longer.

356
00:21:21,976 --> 00:21:24,342
Jenny and I are about
to have a breakthrough.

357
00:21:25,913 --> 00:21:29,349
Right, Jenny ?
Can you look up at me ?

358
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:30,940
Can you look into my eyes ?

359
00:21:31,752 --> 00:21:34,880
Come on, Jenny.
I know you can do this.

360
00:21:34,955 --> 00:21:36,923
- [Screams]
- [Paul] Whoa !

361
00:21:40,694 --> 00:21:42,787
- You OK ?
- Yes. I'm fine.

362
00:21:42,863 --> 00:21:44,330
- You sure ?
- Yes.

- OK, Lucy. You ready to push ?
- Please.

368
00:22:04,551 --> 00:22:07,918
Mr. Henderson, your daughter's
going to start pushing now.

369
00:22:08,022 --> 00:22:10,513
Would you like to come
and sit by her side ?

370
00:22:10,591 --> 00:22:12,616
- For what ?
- [Sighs]

371
00:22:12,693 --> 00:22:15,321
Why don't you squeeze my hand, OK ?
If you need to.

372
00:22:15,396 --> 00:22:16,556
OK.

373
00:22:18,932 --> 00:22:20,490
- OK.

00:22:20,601 --> 00:22:22,728
- Lucy, you ready ?
- [Lucy] Yeah.

375
00:22:22,803 --> 00:22:26,102
- OK, go ahead and push.
- [Grunting]

376
00:22:26,173 --> 00:22:27,470
Good. Push.

377
00:22:28,342 --> 00:22:31,106
Good. Good. Push.

381
00:22:39,353 --> 00:22:42,720
- She's short of breath with JVD.
- Isn't Eastern medicine your thing ?

382
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:45,020
I have a lot of things.
She's short of breath.

383
00:22:45,092 --> 00:22:47,754
Do you want to double check
or trust me ?

384
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,429
The baby's in distress. OK, Lucy,
don't push for right now, all right ?

385
00:22:56,503 --> 00:22:57,970
Just give me a minute, OK ?

386
00:22:58,038 --> 00:23:00,165
Dr. Montgomery, something's wrong.

387
00:23:01,108 --> 00:23:03,576
Lucy ? Lucy ? Lucy, wake up !

388
00:23:03,644 --> 00:23:06,204
Lucy, wake up ! Lucy ?
Get her on high-flow oxygen.

389
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,305
- Get an ambulance.
- Just held her hand.

390
00:23:08,382 --> 00:23:11,351
She's going into congestive
heart failure ! Ambulance !

391
00:23:11,452 --> 00:23:14,353
Lucy ? Honey ?
Her mom died. In childbirth.

392
00:23:14,421 --> 00:23:16,582
She died having Lucy.

393
00:23:21,228 --> 00:23:24,322
I'm applying pressure,
but the cord is compressed.

394
00:23:24,398 --> 00:23:25,558
She's going to be OK ?

395
00:23:25,632 --> 00:23:28,066
And Lucy's blood is flooding her lungs,

396
00:23:28,135 --> 00:23:31,969
and the umbilical cord is cutting off
the baby's blood supply.

397
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:34,564
- I called the ambulance.
- How long does it take ?

398
00:23:34,641 --> 00:23:36,609
Ten to 20 minutes in traffic.

399
00:23:37,211 --> 00:23:39,145
- We don't have 20 minutes.
- I know.

400
00:23:39,213 --> 00:23:41,977
- We're going to lose her and the baby.
- I know.

401
00:23:54,328 --> 00:23:56,489
Thought you might be hungry.

402
00:23:57,331 --> 00:23:59,697
You'll have to pay for it.
That and the ice pack.

403
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,530
- And the flip flops. But...
- Thanks.

404
00:24:02,603 --> 00:24:04,730
- You OK ?
- Yeah.

405
00:24:04,805 --> 00:24:07,501
It's just... Look, I know her.

406
00:24:07,574 --> 00:24:10,941
She's been coming to see me
for months, and I know her.

407
00:24:11,011 --> 00:24:14,947
She's not the type to...
She's gentle.

- Look, I'm sorry. But I don't think...

410
00:24:20,654 --> 00:24:23,088
I don't think you know
how to handle this.

411
00:24:23,157 --> 00:24:24,715
I do know how to handle this.

412
00:24:24,792 --> 00:24:28,319
There's something I'm not seeing.
Something she's not telling me.

413
00:24:28,395 --> 00:24:31,762
If she's not telling her shrink,
you must not be good at your job.

- Violet, we have to...
- Think of your sister. Please.

417
00:24:40,474 --> 00:24:44,171
- I'm working here, Cooper.
- Really ? It looks like you're shopping.

418
00:24:44,244 --> 00:24:47,805
It's a joke. Dell told me you were here.
I came to see if you need help.

419
00:24:47,881 --> 00:24:51,214
- You look like you could use some.
- No, I don't need any help.

You know what ? This ?

421
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:55,955
You drove all the way down here
to see if I was still mad at you.

422
00:24:56,023 --> 00:24:58,457
Who is the stalker now ?

423
00:24:58,525 --> 00:25:01,358
- Let's settle down.
- Sorry, I got to let them take her.

424
00:25:01,428 --> 00:25:04,659
- If she gets violent with you...
- She got violent with you ?

425
00:25:04,731 --> 00:25:07,825
- Come... Look at the pupils.
- Not now, Cooper.

426
00:25:08,235 --> 00:25:11,568
This is a psychiatric emergency.
I can stabilize her.

427
00:25:11,638 --> 00:25:14,573
Just give me a minute
and give me backup if I need it.

428
00:25:15,576 --> 00:25:17,134
I just feel...

429
00:25:17,945 --> 00:25:21,176
...if I knew how it started or
where she was when it happened.

430
00:25:21,248 --> 00:25:23,546
So how do you figure out
how it started ?

431
00:25:26,987 --> 00:25:29,217
You have security cameras, don't you ?

432
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:32,916
He wanted to "find himself."
Turns out he wanted to find me,

433
00:25:32,993 --> 00:25:36,554
only 15 years younger and half as
smart. Any idea what that's like ?

434
00:25:36,663 --> 00:25:40,121
- I think I can imagine.
- Like I don't feel my age, feel scared ?

00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,566
I feel it alone while
he's yanking it in a cup

436
00:25:42,669 --> 00:25:44,534

437
00:25:44,605 --> 00:25:47,267
I know this is unfair.
I understand. Believe me.

438
00:25:47,341 --> 00:25:50,071
- You know, I was with him 17 years.
- Maria,

439
00:25:50,143 --> 00:25:52,634
Ken really wanted Leslie
to have his baby.

440
00:25:52,713 --> 00:25:55,341
And Leslie wants Leslie
to have Ken's money.

441
00:25:55,415 --> 00:25:59,044
- I don't think that she would do that.
- I didn't think my husband'd dump me.

442
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:00,882
So there you go.

443
00:26:02,289 --> 00:26:05,224
If you want protection,
legal protection,

444
00:26:05,292 --> 00:26:07,852
I think Leslie would agree
to whatever you ask.

445
00:26:07,928 --> 00:26:10,954
I don't want protection.
I want Ken's sperm.

446
00:26:11,031 --> 00:26:12,862
- What ?
- For myself.

447
00:26:14,801 --> 00:26:17,736
Now we'll see who ends up alone, right ?

00:26:19,373 --> 00:26:21,671
Where the hell is the ambulance ?

449
00:26:21,742 --> 00:26:24,438
- You have to make a choice.
- Make a choice ?

450
00:26:25,612 --> 00:26:29,446
If I wait any longer for the ambulance,
I could lose them both.

451
00:26:29,516 --> 00:26:31,780
Or I get the baby out
and maybe save them.

452
00:26:31,852 --> 00:26:35,219
- Save them ! Of course.
- Maybe. Maybe save them.

453
00:26:35,289 --> 00:26:37,450
Dell, glove up.

454
00:26:37,524 --> 00:26:39,788
I need you to decompress the cord.
Come here.

455
00:26:42,296 --> 00:26:45,060
- Like this ?
- Yes, that's good. Steady pressure.

456
00:26:45,132 --> 00:26:46,099
OK.

457
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:51,633
[Exhales]

458
00:26:52,372 --> 00:26:56,206
I need to be in a hospital. There's
no way I can perform a C-section here.

459
00:26:56,276 --> 00:26:58,836
It's not sterile,
I don't have any equipment...

460
00:26:58,912 --> 00:27:00,539
- Addison.
...no extra blood,

461
00:27:00,614 --> 00:27:02,844
an epidural would take too long.

462
00:27:02,916 --> 00:27:06,249
She's a healthy 17-year-old.
No one could have foreseen this.

463
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,256
Know what happens when a scalpel
slices into a person without anesthesia ?

464
00:27:10,324 --> 00:27:12,087
- Addison...
- Shut up !

465
00:27:12,192 --> 00:27:16,060
I am trying to talk myself into this.
I can't when you keep Addisoning me.

466
00:27:16,129 --> 00:27:18,893
So just... [exhales] hold on.

467
00:27:29,609 --> 00:27:33,067
OK. Pete, take over for Dell.

468
00:27:33,146 --> 00:27:35,808
Dell, go find a surgical tray
from somewhere.

469
00:27:35,882 --> 00:27:38,350
She will feel every slice,
but we have to try.

470
00:27:38,418 --> 00:27:40,147
- Addison.
- I am going to scrub in,

471
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:43,189
find sterile drapes,
a local anesthetic to help the pain.

472
00:27:43,256 --> 00:27:45,622
- [Pete] Addison.
- Stop Addisoning me !

473
00:27:45,692 --> 00:27:48,627
I can treat her
so she won't feel any pain.

474
00:27:49,896 --> 00:27:52,456
The cameras show her on this aisle.

475
00:27:52,532 --> 00:27:55,092
She stopped, next thing,
she's looking at the floor.

476
00:27:55,202 --> 00:27:58,171
[Cooper] Maybe a camping accident ?
Something traumatic.

477
00:27:58,271 --> 00:28:02,037
Or maybe, you know,
this guy, he works here,

478
00:28:02,109 --> 00:28:05,476
he told me that marshmallow gets so hot
it sticks like napalm.

479
00:28:06,346 --> 00:28:10,840
- That's not that bad, I guess.
- [Cooper] Not bad enough for counting.

480
00:28:15,155 --> 00:28:16,816
They had a house at the lake.

481
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:20,553
[Pete] I stimulated the needles.
Lidocaine's in, pain receptors blocked.

482
00:28:20,627 --> 00:28:23,152
- She's ready.
- She's not going to feel anything ?

483
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:25,790
- I'm sure.
- If she wakes up screaming in pain...

484
00:28:25,866 --> 00:28:29,495
- I'm sure. I'm very good at what I do.
- Are you really, really sure ?

485

She was divorcing Ken's sperm.

She was with Ken for 17 years,
that should count for something.

He loved her.

He met her on a hiking trip in Sedona.

That I was questioning.

511

Instead of working on it,
you shut the door.

How are we to work on that ?

more rights than Leslie.

24 hours will pass, Ken won't be viable.

It says he was suffering from double

He was ten.

592
00:35:51,911 --> 00:35:54,345
Diagnosed with a Brainstem Glioma.

593
00:35:54,914 --> 00:35:57,610
[Violet] That something
they could've caught earlier ?

594
00:35:57,684 --> 00:35:59,379
No, they got it early.

595
00:35:59,452 --> 00:36:03,218
But, because of the location of the
tumor in the brain, it was inoperable.

596
00:36:03,289 --> 00:36:07,953
So Will started chemo and radiation
and they put him on a steroid

597
00:36:08,027 --> 00:36:10,587
to reduce the pressure in the brain
from the tumor.

598
00:36:14,033 --> 00:36:16,263
And the tumor responded, at first,

599
00:36:16,336 --> 00:36:20,705
and then Will developed kidney failure.

00:36:20,807 --> 00:36:23,935

00:41:34,453 --> 00:41:36,921
Why didn't you tell them I was coming ?

653
00:41:36,989 --> 00:41:37,956
Truth.

654
00:41:40,793 --> 00:41:43,819
All right. Fine.

655
00:41:43,896 --> 00:41:46,387
I need you here.

656
00:41:46,465 --> 00:41:50,026
OK ? I need you here because I'm tired,

657
00:41:50,102 --> 00:41:53,868
and I'm lonely,
and my best friend divorced me

658
00:41:53,973 --> 00:41:55,463
and I have no one.

659
00:41:56,542 --> 00:41:58,510
I need you here to be my someone.

660
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:03,305
All right, I shared. You satisfied ?

661
00:42:03,382 --> 00:42:06,146
- I'm gonna need a lot of cheesecake.
- [Elevator dings]

662
00:42:06,252 --> 00:42:07,742
OK.

663
00:42:15,962 --> 00:42:21,093
We want to see you in the conference
room, if that's OK. I mean now.

664
00:42:26,806 --> 00:42:30,572
- [Violet] We're a team. We're partners.
- [Sam] Can't just bring somebody in.

665
00:42:30,643 --> 00:42:33,203
- [Pete] Without asking.
- We're a democracy. We vote.

666
00:42:33,312 --> 00:42:36,042
- We vote, or it doesn't happen.
- You're right.

667
00:42:37,583 --> 00:42:40,143
We should have voted.

668
00:42:40,219 --> 00:42:41,846
I was wrong.

669
00:42:42,989 --> 00:42:45,924
Good. OK. Let's vote.

670
00:42:45,992 --> 00:42:49,155
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa !
Hold on a minute.

671
00:42:49,228 --> 00:42:54,393
Ah... I have been working here
less than 24 hours,

672
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:58,630
and in that time, I discovered
that I am not welcome here,

673
00:42:58,704 --> 00:43:01,468
I learned that I am
a one man gynie show,

674
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:04,998
and I performed crazy MacGyver surgery

675
00:43:05,077 --> 00:43:08,205
and Sam saw my booty ! [chuckles]

676
00:43:08,281 --> 00:43:12,115
So this has not been a great day
for me. This day kind of sucked.

677
00:43:12,184 --> 00:43:14,846
But you know what ? I had one patient.

678
00:43:14,921 --> 00:43:19,756
One patient. The entire day.
And I loved it.

679
00:43:19,825 --> 00:43:24,728
So you want me gone ? Too bad. I'm in.

680
00:43:24,797 --> 00:43:28,494
I'm putting my foot down.
My foot's down. It's down.

681
00:43:29,402 --> 00:43:32,132
I'm not going anywhere. So...

682
00:43:34,373 --> 00:43:36,341
...yeah.

683
00:43:36,442 --> 00:43:40,811
I thought I had a big finish, but...

684
00:43:42,281 --> 00:43:47,651
...I don't, so... I'm done.

685
00:43:53,326 --> 00:43:55,556
No. No !

686
00:43:55,628 --> 00:43:57,926
I do have a big finish.

687
00:44:00,166 --> 00:44:02,999
If I hadn't been here today,
if you'd had someone else,

688
00:44:03,069 --> 00:44:05,833
that girl would have died
delivering her baby.

689
00:44:05,938 --> 00:44:07,803
I saved her life.

690
00:44:07,873 --> 00:44:09,602
I saved your asses.

691
00:44:10,843 --> 00:44:13,812
I'm a world-class neonatal surgeon.

692
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,739
And I'm here to stay.

693
00:44:18,985 --> 00:44:21,545
Welcome to the new Oceanside Wellness.

694
00:44:21,654 --> 00:44:24,350
[ ? Swingfly :
<i>Something's Got Me Started]</i>

695
00:44:29,628 --> 00:44:31,789
That's why I didn't tell you
she was coming.
