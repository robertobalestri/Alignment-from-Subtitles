00:08:38,755 --> 00:08:42,418
It's not a problem. It's going
to bring in 20,000 dollars in two days.

167
00:08:42,492 --> 00:08:46,223
Everybody needs to leave Cooper alone.
Great idea. Godspeed.

168
00:08:48,598 --> 00:08:52,557
Hey. What were you up to last night ?
I called you, but got no answer.

169
00:08:52,635 --> 00:08:54,500
I crashed early.

170
00:08:56,172 --> 00:08:58,140
- Hey, Pete.
- Hey.

171
00:08:58,241 --> 00:09:00,573
Have fun at your class.

172
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:05,370
- "Have fun at your class."
- I'm being a friend.

173
00:09:05,448 --> 00:09:07,006
We are doing "friendship."

174
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,950
I'm your friend, and you've
never been that nice to me.

175
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:12,510
We're adjusting, all right ? It's just...

176
00:09:12,588 --> 00:09:16,024
Whenever we give each other
a hard time or we start to fight...

177
00:09:16,092 --> 00:09:17,354
I mean, that's when...

178
00:09:17,427 --> 00:09:19,987
That's when the two of you
get hot for each other.

179
00:09:20,063 --> 00:09:23,692
It's twisted. That's why
I don't know what to do about my cop.

180
00:09:23,766 --> 00:09:27,429
I think maybe he's interested,
but maybe I shouldn't inflict myself

181
00:09:27,503 --> 00:09:30,836
on a decent, unsuspecting
officer of the peace.

182
00:09:30,907 --> 00:09:32,772
Well, maybe that's what you need.

183
00:09:33,643 --> 00:09:37,010
My track record with men lately...
He's probably a crazy.

184
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,288
We checked your LH levels
and they're normal.

185
00:09:46,355 --> 00:09:49,188
- You're ovulating.
- Good. That's good, right ?

186
00:09:49,258 --> 00:09:52,227
We did find some fibroids,
so we should monitor them.

187
00:09:52,328 --> 00:09:55,889
I knew it. It's always me.
First my vagina was locked and now...

188
00:09:55,965 --> 00:09:57,626
Get your money back. I am a dud.

189
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,067
The fertility issue
doesn't lie with you.

190
00:10:01,137 --> 00:10:05,164
Geoffrey, we checked your sperm count
and, unfortunately, it was very low.

191
00:10:05,942 --> 00:10:07,603
How low ?

192
00:10:07,677 --> 00:10:10,771
There were no viable sperm
in your specimen.

193
00:10:10,847 --> 00:10:14,339
I'm sorry, Geoffrey. You're sterile.

194
00:10:26,329 --> 00:10:29,264
I know this isn't what you want to hear,
but there is hope.

195
00:10:29,332 --> 00:10:33,428
There are other options.
There's sperm donation, adoption.

196
00:10:33,503 --> 00:10:37,166
The main thing is you can have a child.
A family.

197
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,707
- No adoption.
- Wait.

198
00:10:38,774 --> 00:10:41,004
Don't know if we
should be ruling that out.

199
00:10:41,077 --> 00:10:42,806
We're going with a sperm donor.

200
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:47,009
You've always wanted to be pregnant,
you've always wanted a baby of your own.

201
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,916
Do we have to decide now ?
Is there a reason to rush ?

202
00:10:49,986 --> 00:10:54,753
Not to rush, but fertility does decline
every year for a woman

203
00:10:54,824 --> 00:10:56,451
after the age of 35.

204
00:10:56,526 --> 00:10:59,757
And the fibroids
could eventually interfere...

205
00:10:59,829 --> 00:11:02,992
Right. We get it.
We've got to go for it now.

206
00:11:04,233 --> 00:11:06,133
They said you're ovulating.

207
00:11:06,202 --> 00:11:08,932
Doesn't that mean
we're in the zone to try ?

208
00:11:09,005 --> 00:11:11,166
That's right. Yes.

209
00:11:12,308 --> 00:11:14,606
Are you sure you're OK with this ?

210
00:11:14,677 --> 00:11:19,171
Cathleen, I love you.
It's what you want. What I want.

211
00:11:21,784 --> 00:11:23,251
I'm sure.

212
00:11:25,121 --> 00:11:27,089
What's wrong with Dell's granddad ?

213
00:11:27,156 --> 00:11:29,681
It's just some minor bumps and bruises.

214
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:32,592
Dell's concerned
there might be some abuse going on,

215
00:11:32,662 --> 00:11:35,825
but Nate and Wendell are adamant
that that's not happening.

216
00:11:35,898 --> 00:11:40,232
Dell's grandfather is a war vet. He'd be
too proud to admit something like that.

217
00:11:40,303 --> 00:11:44,171
Where's the mom ? Dell's always
getting postcards from India and China.

218
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,505
Yeah, I asked him once.
He said that she was a rolling stone.

219
00:11:47,577 --> 00:11:49,875
[Naomi] She left Dell
with his grandparents.

220
00:11:49,946 --> 00:11:52,312
Wendell went in the home
after his wife died.

221
00:11:52,415 --> 00:11:54,576
You sure know a lot about Dell.

222
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:57,141
If Dell suspects something,
maybe you should.

223
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,121
I read a paper about elder abuse.
It's under-reported.

224
00:12:00,189 --> 00:12:04,023
I'll call the nursing home, see if
I can get a hold of his medical records.

225
00:12:05,394 --> 00:12:08,955
Hey, Sam.
Tell me what that was about, earlier.

226
00:12:09,699 --> 00:12:11,860
Oh, uh...

227
00:12:13,502 --> 00:12:16,938
I just think that it would be nice
if we kept this thing private.

228
00:12:17,006 --> 00:12:19,167
Well, somebody already found out, Sam.

229
00:12:19,242 --> 00:12:22,268
And, honestly,
I don't think it's that big of a deal.

230
00:12:22,345 --> 00:12:24,609
You afraid this is
gonna mean commitment ?

231
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:28,548
Because if you're ashamed
of having sex with your ex-wife, then...

232
00:12:28,618 --> 00:12:32,247
- Naomi, I got labs for your patient.
- Just leave it on my desk.

233
00:12:32,321 --> 00:12:33,583
Sorry.

234
00:12:34,991 --> 00:12:37,858
Jeez. They're really going at it lately.

235
00:12:37,927 --> 00:12:41,021
One minute they're grinning,
the next minute they're...

236
00:12:41,097 --> 00:12:44,066
- You think they're going at it ?
- Sex ?

237
00:12:45,001 --> 00:12:47,561
No. No. You think so ?

238
00:12:48,271 --> 00:12:50,239
As much as they argue ?

239
00:12:50,906 --> 00:12:52,601
Angry sex is hot.

240
00:12:57,713 --> 00:13:02,013
I called the nursing home and they sent
over Wendell and Nate's medical records.

241
00:13:02,084 --> 00:13:05,611
There have been a bunch of injury
reports in the past few months.

242
00:13:05,688 --> 00:13:09,124
- Minor scrapes, bruises.
- So I was right to be concerned.

243
00:13:09,191 --> 00:13:13,321
It's not proof of anything, but yeah,
you were right to be concerned.

244
00:13:15,665 --> 00:13:18,031
- I'm gonna check this out.
- I'll go with you.

245
00:13:18,134 --> 00:13:21,103
- I can handle this.
- Technically, they're my patients.

246
00:13:21,203 --> 00:13:24,570
Which means, legally,
I'm as obligated to them as anyone else.

247
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,870
- I told you, I don't...
- Dell, I'm going.

248
00:13:31,847 --> 00:13:34,543
All right.
Let's start by picking up our babies.

249
00:13:36,585 --> 00:13:38,519
But with two hands.

250
00:13:38,587 --> 00:13:41,852
My baby looks like Chucky.
Do you want to trade ?

251
00:13:41,924 --> 00:13:43,789
- No way.
- No trading babies.

252
00:13:43,859 --> 00:13:47,124
One thing we're trying to teach you
is to bond with your newborn.

253
00:13:47,196 --> 00:13:49,164
I don't want to bond with Chucky.

254
00:13:49,265 --> 00:13:53,429
These babies are gonna come into
your life and seem so small and fragile

255
00:13:53,536 --> 00:13:57,632
that you're going to be
afraid to touch them. Don't be.

256
00:13:57,707 --> 00:14:01,473
They need to be held and
they're a lot tougher than they look.

257
00:14:01,544 --> 00:14:04,308
I heard a baby can eat
half a cup of sand and be fine.

258
00:14:04,413 --> 00:14:05,971
That's not...

259
00:14:06,048 --> 00:14:08,380
What about that baby
that fell 11 stories ?

260
00:14:08,451 --> 00:14:11,614
Crawled away without a scratch.
You can't break a baby.

261
00:14:11,687 --> 00:14:15,748
Yeah, you can.
From 11 stories, totally breakable.

262
00:14:15,825 --> 00:14:18,123
- Who's your pediatrician ?
- You know what ?

263
00:14:18,194 --> 00:14:20,424
Why don't we start with the basics ?

264
00:14:20,496 --> 00:14:21,588
Um...

265
00:14:22,365 --> 00:14:26,199
Changing a diaper.
Who wants to give it a try ?

266
00:14:31,474 --> 00:14:33,908
- I'd like to try.
- Adam ! Our first volunteer.

267
00:14:33,976 --> 00:14:36,035
Let's do this ! Dr. Pete.

268
00:14:36,112 --> 00:14:39,081
OK, gentlemen, put your babies down.
Support the head.

269
00:14:39,181 --> 00:14:41,012
Next time support the head.

270
00:14:42,184 --> 00:14:45,017
He's probably with Nate or Arthur.
They play bingo.

271
00:14:45,087 --> 00:14:46,554
Where is everybody ?

272
00:14:51,127 --> 00:14:54,426
We're looking for Wendell in room 310.
Do you know where he is ?

273
00:14:54,497 --> 00:14:58,934
- If he's not in his room, I don't...
- We checked his room. He's not there.

274
00:14:59,001 --> 00:15:01,469
Aren't you supposed to be watching them ?

275
00:15:02,605 --> 00:15:06,905
They give me five an hour not to.
If you can do better...

276
00:15:09,912 --> 00:15:11,971
You think that guy was messing with us ?

277
00:15:12,047 --> 00:15:13,981
I should have given him a 20.

278
00:15:15,084 --> 00:15:17,143
[Distant shouting]

279
00:15:17,219 --> 00:15:18,652
You hear that ?

280
00:15:18,721 --> 00:15:20,689
Yeah, I hear it.

281
00:15:29,498 --> 00:15:30,795
Stick it to him !

282
00:15:40,176 --> 00:15:41,803
Come on ! Come on !

283
00:15:43,646 --> 00:15:47,207
Stop ! Stop !
You two are going to kill each other !

284
00:15:47,316 --> 00:15:48,874
Get him !

285
00:15:48,984 --> 00:15:51,077
- Pa Pa !
- Stay out of this !

286
00:15:51,153 --> 00:15:52,677
This is a championship match !

287
00:15:52,755 --> 00:15:55,315
Don't want him making excuses
when I kick his butt.

288
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:58,417
- First time for everything.
- Except you growing a pair.

289
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:05,492
Come on, get up ! Is that all you got ?

290
00:16:05,901 --> 00:16:09,132
Heart rate's down to 30.
I can barely feel his pulse. He's hurt.

291
00:16:09,205 --> 00:16:13,107
Sure he is ! Come on ! Get up,
you old geezer ! Get some more of this !

292
00:16:13,175 --> 00:16:17,134
No, no. Game over. He's really hurt.
We got to get him an ambulance.

293
00:16:17,246 --> 00:16:19,373
I need to get him to a hospital now !

294
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:23,977
Good first day, you guys.
Check your babies at the door.

295
00:16:25,187 --> 00:16:28,748
Guys, that was amazing !
I was wondering if there's any homework ?

296
00:16:28,858 --> 00:16:30,485
No. No, homework.

297
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:33,858
Your energy is great for this class.
And it's OK to be nervous.

298
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:36,090
It's normal for a first-time dad.

299
00:16:36,165 --> 00:16:39,328
Thanks, but I'm actually not a dad.
I'm just here for Jack.

300
00:16:39,401 --> 00:16:41,494
- Jack is your partner ?
- No. No.

301
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:44,334
He's a partner at the firm,
but I'm just his assistant.

302
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,967
- That's why I'm taking the class.
- Jack is your boss.

303
00:16:48,043 --> 00:16:50,978
- He sent his assistant.
- Second assistant, actually.

304
00:16:51,046 --> 00:16:54,140
But not for long...
thanks to this class.

305
00:16:54,216 --> 00:16:57,845
- You need to tell him to be here.
- No, no. I couldn't tell him that.

306
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,684
He'll destroy me. Or have me destroyed.

307
00:17:00,789 --> 00:17:04,054
The requirement for this class
is you're going to be a dad.

308
00:17:04,126 --> 00:17:08,153
So if your boss wants to take the class,
he has to attend himself.

309
00:17:16,272 --> 00:17:17,830
Hey. You're still here ?

310
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:21,239
Cathleen went back for one more look
at the sperm donor books.

311
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:24,279
She's hoping something will click.

312
00:17:25,047 --> 00:17:27,777
I'm going to give her this baby.

313
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:30,410
I believe you. You're determined.

314
00:17:32,221 --> 00:17:35,190
But why so determined ?

315
00:17:36,992 --> 00:17:39,756
Cathleen never asks for much.

316
00:17:39,828 --> 00:17:41,728
I promised her a happy life.

317
00:17:41,797 --> 00:17:44,231
You have to get over yourself
to do that.

318
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,064
Well, I wonder
how Cathleen would feel about that,

319
00:17:47,136 --> 00:17:50,469
you disregarding your own feelings
to give her what she wants.

320
00:17:53,275 --> 00:17:56,574
She doesn't talk about it,
but Cathleen was adopted.

321
00:17:56,645 --> 00:18:01,014
I mean, she's got great parents,
but I wanted to give her what I had.

322
00:18:01,116 --> 00:18:03,448
You know, my family.
They're crazy, but...

323
00:18:05,421 --> 00:18:08,788
She gets to have one person in her life
that looks like her.

324
00:18:08,857 --> 00:18:12,088
But what about what you want, Geoffrey ?

325
00:18:12,728 --> 00:18:17,563
I tell you what. Why don't you...
go home, get some sleep,

326
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:21,194
think about it
and then start over tomorrow ?

327
00:18:28,277 --> 00:18:30,245
<i>[Woman] Dr. Shaeford to OR Three.</i>

328
00:18:30,346 --> 00:18:33,907
- How is he ?
- Well, he had a heart attack.

329
00:18:34,016 --> 00:18:36,484
We're trying to re-open
his blocked vessels.

330
00:18:36,552 --> 00:18:39,646
I did that ? I did that to him ?

331
00:18:39,722 --> 00:18:43,988
Well, I'm sure it didn't help that you
decked him, but we can't say right now.

332
00:18:46,629 --> 00:18:48,392
I don't believe this.

333
00:18:48,464 --> 00:18:50,728
We didn't mean for anyone to get hurt.

334
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,962
- Then why did you hit each other ?
- We had to do something.

335
00:18:54,069 --> 00:18:58,506
The days there,
you can't tell one from another.

336
00:18:59,341 --> 00:19:02,310
Me, Nate, we were all going crazy.

337
00:19:02,411 --> 00:19:03,742
That part's obvious.

338
00:19:03,812 --> 00:19:06,144
Maybe your granddaddy needs a minute...

339
00:19:06,215 --> 00:19:10,879
I got it. I need you to swear, OK ?
No more of this.

340
00:19:11,987 --> 00:19:14,512
You think I don't know it's over ?

341
00:19:20,896 --> 00:19:22,329
Dell.

342
00:19:35,544 --> 00:19:37,910
- Old man fight club ?
- Oh, yeah.

343
00:19:39,114 --> 00:19:40,672
Wendell was the ringleader.

344
00:19:40,783 --> 00:19:45,015
Knocked the hell out of his friend
who's, actually, not doing too well now.

345
00:19:45,087 --> 00:19:48,386
It's amazing what people will do
to entertain themselves.

346
00:19:48,457 --> 00:19:50,118
- Come here.
- What ?

347
00:19:50,192 --> 00:19:51,454
Oh.

348
00:19:52,461 --> 00:19:55,157
- What are you doing ?
- Hmm.

349
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:58,791
I'm just entertaining myself.
And you. Trying, at least.

350
00:19:58,867 --> 00:19:59,993
- No.
- Come here.

351
00:20:00,069 --> 00:20:03,436
- Sam, no. No. No.
- What ?

352
00:20:08,377 --> 00:20:13,144
- I'm not going to be your secret lover.
- Oh, come on, Naomi.

353
00:20:14,183 --> 00:20:18,552
You're mad because I'm trying
to spice things up now that we're...

354
00:20:19,655 --> 00:20:21,384
...whatever we are.

355
00:20:21,457 --> 00:20:25,018
OK, everybody around here ?
They already went through our divorce.

356
00:20:25,127 --> 00:20:28,153
Do we really have to drag them
through every detail now ?

357
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,788
This is not about them.

358
00:20:29,865 --> 00:20:34,825
This is about things being different
the second time around.

359
00:20:34,903 --> 00:20:37,633
If there is a second time around.

360
00:20:39,908 --> 00:20:43,969
I need to know you're not
just going to give up this time.

361
00:20:44,046 --> 00:20:47,140
Forget it. I got to go.
I have to get... I have a patient.

362
00:20:47,216 --> 00:20:48,683
Listen. Wait.

363
00:20:50,652 --> 00:20:53,621
Naomi, your patient's here.

364
00:20:54,256 --> 00:20:55,917
- Right. I know.
- Yeah. Yeah.

365
00:20:56,825 --> 00:20:58,554
Oh, uh...

366
00:20:58,627 --> 00:21:02,358
I was looking over these medical reports
from the nursing home...

367
00:21:02,431 --> 00:21:04,126
What did you do to her ?

368
00:21:06,001 --> 00:21:08,526
- Excuse me ?
- You heard me. What did you do ?

369
00:21:08,604 --> 00:21:11,573
- I don't think it's your business.
- No, it is, OK ?

370
00:21:11,673 --> 00:21:14,699
No, it's not, Dell.
I know you're upset about Wendell...

371
00:21:14,777 --> 00:21:16,540
This has nothing to do with him.

372
00:21:16,612 --> 00:21:19,080
Every time she walks away from you
she's miserable,

373
00:21:19,148 --> 00:21:21,082
and I care about how she feels.
I care !

374
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:24,176
No, I know what you think,
but this isn't just a crush, OK ?

375
00:21:24,253 --> 00:21:27,416
Maybe after so many years
you just don't see it.

376
00:21:27,489 --> 00:21:30,515
You know how many women
think like that and look like that

377
00:21:30,592 --> 00:21:32,753
and laugh like that and care ?

378
00:21:32,861 --> 00:21:34,920
One. So far, I've met one.

379
00:21:34,997 --> 00:21:40,094
She's out of my league in every way,
but I don't care. She dazzles me.

380
00:21:40,169 --> 00:21:43,900
And I won't meet someone like her
when the "time is right"

381
00:21:43,972 --> 00:21:47,066
because I won't. I love her, OK ?

382
00:21:47,142 --> 00:21:50,305
And I guarantee you,
I wouldn't make her cry.

383
00:21:50,412 --> 00:21:55,748
OK, uh, Dell, I know that you're
under a lot of stress right now,

384
00:21:55,818 --> 00:22:00,050
so I'm going to pretend you didn't
just say those things about my wife.

385
00:22:03,158 --> 00:22:04,648
Ex-wife.

386
00:22:13,635 --> 00:22:17,765
I just wanted to let you know I'm going
to do my job, but I'm done with Dell.

387
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,502
- Hey, what happened ?
- Dell is a...

388
00:22:21,777 --> 00:22:24,803
- Dell's a child.
- Sam, will you cut him a break ?

389
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,905
Oh, you have no idea.

390
00:22:26,982 --> 00:22:29,143
I'm cutting him a break.

391
00:22:30,185 --> 00:22:32,449
A big damn break.

392
00:22:40,696 --> 00:22:44,154
We put a lock on the basement door.
They were taking bets.

393
00:22:44,233 --> 00:22:48,329
The winner would walk around
all puffed up. What a thing, huh.

394
00:22:48,403 --> 00:22:50,166
G-49.

395
00:22:57,446 --> 00:22:58,811
Hey, Pa Pa.

396
00:23:00,482 --> 00:23:02,006
[Woman] l-26.

397
00:23:02,084 --> 00:23:03,449
Nate ?

398
00:23:03,518 --> 00:23:05,452
Uh, the same.

399
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,045
The doctors put a pacemaker in.

400
00:23:09,024 --> 00:23:10,992
You shouldn't blame yourself.

401
00:23:11,093 --> 00:23:12,754
He didn't have to fight you.

402
00:23:13,896 --> 00:23:16,057
I should have known better.

403
00:23:22,237 --> 00:23:23,568
Hey.

404
00:23:23,639 --> 00:23:26,301
- Still no click.
- Where's Geoffrey ?

405
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:31,039
On his way. It's not like we haven't
gone over these guys a million times.

406
00:23:31,113 --> 00:23:33,240
- Hey.
- I think I've solved our problem.

407
00:23:33,315 --> 00:23:35,681
I found the perfect donor.

408
00:23:36,351 --> 00:23:39,718
- Mark.
- I'd like you to meet my brother.

409
00:23:39,821 --> 00:23:42,187
- Your brother ?
- Hey, yeah.

410
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:43,918
Let's make a kid.

411
00:23:47,596 --> 00:23:49,086
[Charlotte] So it's true.

412
00:23:51,133 --> 00:23:53,158
I had to see it for myself.

413
00:23:54,202 --> 00:23:57,262
You stole my dads.
You took my class roster.

414
00:23:57,339 --> 00:24:01,036
I just had to refund $27,000.
You know how that looks ?

415
00:24:01,109 --> 00:24:03,202
See how it feels to be someone's bitch ?

416
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:06,839
I see. This is a game to you.

417
00:24:06,949 --> 00:24:09,816
- It's not for you ? Come on.
- You know what ?

418
00:24:09,885 --> 00:24:12,376
We're off for tonight.
Game over.

419
00:24:15,857 --> 00:24:17,415
I know this is a little close.

420
00:24:17,492 --> 00:24:20,052
But Cathleen said herself,
she doesn't settle.

421
00:24:20,162 --> 00:24:24,496
- She has her idea of what she wants.
- And I'm the next best thing.

422
00:24:24,566 --> 00:24:26,932
Are you sure you're OK
with this, Mark ?

423
00:24:27,002 --> 00:24:28,936
I mean, you'd be making a child.

424
00:24:29,004 --> 00:24:32,963
I'm not having the baby.
I'm just gonna be doing the uncle thing.

425
00:24:33,075 --> 00:24:37,444
It sounds simple now, but sometimes
donations from family members can...

426
00:24:37,512 --> 00:24:40,481
- It gets complicated.
- Yeah.

427
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:43,450
- Mark's not complicated.
- No, I'm not complicated.

428
00:24:43,518 --> 00:24:46,248
I mean, he won't think twice about this.

429
00:24:46,321 --> 00:24:47,583
- You won't ?
- Nope.

430
00:24:47,656 --> 00:24:51,615
I probably have a few kids out there
I don't know about already.

431
00:24:51,693 --> 00:24:53,524
It's a joke.

432
00:24:54,696 --> 00:24:57,859
- It's probably a joke.
- This is good, right ?

433
00:24:57,966 --> 00:25:01,231
I mean, maybe not us, exactly, but,

434
00:25:01,303 --> 00:25:03,271
you know, I'll be in the mix.

435
00:25:04,272 --> 00:25:06,399
- Yes. It's just a little...
- I know.

436
00:25:06,475 --> 00:25:09,137
And we don't have to, at all.
It's just...

437
00:25:09,211 --> 00:25:11,543
No. I want to. You're right.

438
00:25:11,613 --> 00:25:14,878
You'll be in the mix,
and that's what matters.

439
00:25:19,354 --> 00:25:21,413
Hey, have you seen Dr. Montgomery ?

440
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:24,584
- Not lately. Did you ask at reception ?
- Yeah.

441
00:25:25,293 --> 00:25:27,784
- Hey.
- You're back.

442
00:25:27,863 --> 00:25:29,626
Yeah.

443
00:25:29,731 --> 00:25:32,700
And you met Pete. My friend.

444
00:25:32,801 --> 00:25:34,894
Yeah. Kevin Nelson. Hi.

445
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:38,736
I came to pick up
my medical report for work.

446
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,104
You know, they can just
e-mail that to you.

447
00:25:41,176 --> 00:25:42,666
[Addison clears throat]

448
00:25:46,948 --> 00:25:50,315
They can, kind of, e-mail you.

449
00:25:51,086 --> 00:25:53,850
OK... I thought I might see you, and...

450
00:25:55,891 --> 00:26:00,055
<i>[man on radio] Two-two-seven,</i>
<i>we need you on that call back on...</i>

451
00:26:00,996 --> 00:26:04,693
- I've got to take this.
- OK. It was nice to see you again.

452
00:26:14,109 --> 00:26:16,839
Please. Look, I won't be a disturbance.

453
00:26:16,912 --> 00:26:19,779
And if you can just talk into the mic.

454
00:26:20,782 --> 00:26:24,274
[Chuckling] Yeah. No. Sorry, dude.

455
00:26:24,352 --> 00:26:26,820
What am I supposed to tell Jack ?
He'll fire me !

456
00:26:26,888 --> 00:26:31,621
And after those prenatal classes with
his wife and decorating the nursery...

457
00:26:31,693 --> 00:26:33,593
- How about I tell him something ?
- No.

458
00:26:33,662 --> 00:26:36,426
Your wife is about to have a baby, Jack.

459
00:26:36,498 --> 00:26:40,594
So put down the BlackBerry,
stop sending Adam to do your dirty work

460
00:26:40,669 --> 00:26:42,933
and get over here. Got that, Jack-ass ?

461
00:26:48,677 --> 00:26:53,740
OK. Using a speculum, I'm going
to insert a catheter into your uterus

462
00:26:53,815 --> 00:26:56,648
where the sperm will be released.

463
00:26:56,718 --> 00:27:00,848
- Mark's stuff ? It was really OK ?
- Oh, yeah. It was excellent.

464
00:27:00,922 --> 00:27:02,787
Millions of little guys.

465
00:27:02,858 --> 00:27:07,090
So, with any luck,
the "stuff' will swim right to your egg

466
00:27:07,162 --> 00:27:10,325
and presto, you should have an embryo.

467
00:27:10,432 --> 00:27:11,456
Yay !

468
00:27:11,533 --> 00:27:16,266
All right. And here we go.

469
00:27:16,338 --> 00:27:17,600
No !

470
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:23,274
I can't have Mark inside me, this
brother sperm, traveling to my uterus.

471
00:27:23,345 --> 00:27:26,178
- I know.
- Honestly, I love your brother but...

472
00:27:26,248 --> 00:27:28,409
- He's kind of a jerk.
- He's kind of a jerk !

473
00:27:28,483 --> 00:27:31,452
- Why would you even suggest this ?
- I'm trying here, OK ?

474
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,286
Listen, both of you, this isn't
right for you. And that's OK.

475
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:39,258
I don't want anybody's baby but yours.
I'm sorry.

476
00:27:39,327 --> 00:27:43,764
So what do we do ?
Just give up ? Not have a kid ?

477
00:27:43,832 --> 00:27:46,665
I just can't do this. I can't.

478
00:27:46,735 --> 00:27:48,396
There's got to be another way.

479
00:27:49,471 --> 00:27:53,908
Please.
Please help us make our baby.

480
00:28:00,148 --> 00:28:02,514
I thought that
the brother was our solution.

481
00:28:02,617 --> 00:28:04,517
No, they were right. He's a jerk.

482
00:28:04,586 --> 00:28:07,612
I was momentarily attracted to him,
so he must be.

483
00:28:08,757 --> 00:28:10,725
The sweet brother can't make babies.

484
00:28:10,825 --> 00:28:13,191
What does that say
about natural selection ?

485
00:28:13,295 --> 00:28:14,592
What were his levels ?

486
00:28:14,663 --> 00:28:17,496
FSH and prolactin
were within normal limits.

487
00:28:17,566 --> 00:28:21,024
- How about testosterone ?
- Borderline. Borderline low.

488
00:28:21,102 --> 00:28:23,662
But not non-existent.
There might be a way.

489
00:28:23,738 --> 00:28:26,298
And if there is, we should find it.

490
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,541
Screw natural selection.

491
00:28:30,612 --> 00:28:34,378
Gentlemen, prepare
to have your lives transformed.

492
00:28:34,449 --> 00:28:37,213
I present to you : Diaper B. Gone.

493
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:40,485
I'm Jack Grossman.

494
00:28:40,589 --> 00:28:42,853
Which one of you jerks
called me a jackass ?

495
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:45,615
That would be me.

496
00:28:45,694 --> 00:28:49,562
Your name's Jack,
and you were acting like an ass.

497
00:28:49,631 --> 00:28:52,395
You don't know anything about me,

498
00:28:53,335 --> 00:28:58,238
my wife, my work, my life.

499
00:28:58,306 --> 00:29:00,672
- Nothing.
- He was just trying to help.

500
00:29:00,775 --> 00:29:04,609
I know that you pawned off a class
that could help save your baby's life.

501
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:07,204
- You think you're clever ?
- You're a tough guy.

502
00:29:07,282 --> 00:29:10,581
But the tough guy act ?
It's not gonna work with being a father.

503
00:29:10,652 --> 00:29:14,383
I'm doing this my way. My wife's gonna
stay home with our kid and I'm...

504
00:29:14,456 --> 00:29:17,687
- Your wife is not there to do your job.
- You can't check out.

505
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:19,226
You got to show up.

506
00:29:19,294 --> 00:29:23,424
In fact, you have got to screw things up
before you even have the first clue...

507
00:29:24,532 --> 00:29:28,298
How many of you guys have figured out
what it means to be a father ?

508
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:33,139
I don't know much,
but I know more than this guy.

509
00:29:34,643 --> 00:29:37,806
This kid is coming
whether you're ready for it or not.

510
00:29:37,879 --> 00:29:40,439
You think I don't know that ?

511
00:29:40,515 --> 00:29:42,642
You think it doesn't
keep me up at night ?

512
00:29:43,485 --> 00:29:48,047
All I want for that kid
is to be safe and to be happy.

513
00:29:48,156 --> 00:29:50,420
I'm doing everything
that I know how to do.

514
00:29:50,492 --> 00:29:53,359
I believe you. Now do more.

515
00:29:53,428 --> 00:29:57,797
You came here to yell at a pediatrician,
so don't tell me you don't care enough.

516
00:30:05,273 --> 00:30:06,604
I got this.

517
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,575
I'm not fired ?

518
00:30:11,179 --> 00:30:14,740
No. But there's no way
you're watching me do this.

519
00:30:17,352 --> 00:30:21,721
Well, come on, let's show this guy
how to rock this, right ? Come on !

520
00:30:21,823 --> 00:30:24,189
Hey, yeah. Show him how it's done.

521
00:30:27,495 --> 00:30:30,020
So did Officer Manly make a move ?

522
00:30:31,032 --> 00:30:32,897
[Sighing]

523
00:30:32,967 --> 00:30:38,132
- You really want to hear about this ?
- This is what friends do. Right ?

524
00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:41,106
No sex talk. That's off-limits.

525
00:30:41,176 --> 00:30:44,304
I don't usually talk about it.
I'm more of a "do it" guy.

526
00:30:44,379 --> 00:30:45,869
Yeah, good to know.

527
00:30:45,947 --> 00:30:49,815
And the officer
did not get a chance to "move."

528
00:30:50,752 --> 00:30:53,118
- My man choices lately...
- Have been me ?

529
00:30:53,188 --> 00:30:54,314
And Trunk.

530
00:30:57,459 --> 00:30:59,154
Say yes.

531
00:30:59,794 --> 00:31:00,920
It's that simple ?

532
00:31:00,995 --> 00:31:03,361
It's not your fault
there've been misfires.

533
00:31:03,465 --> 00:31:07,526
Dating is a numbers game. Get out there
as much as you can and see what works.

534
00:31:07,602 --> 00:31:09,832
Volume dating. That's your philosophy ?

535
00:31:09,904 --> 00:31:12,668
Most of the time you're not
gonna find the right fit.

536
00:31:12,774 --> 00:31:16,039
Sometimes it's the last person
you think who makes you happy.

537
00:31:17,312 --> 00:31:21,078
And, yeah, I'm out there.

538
00:31:23,051 --> 00:31:26,578
Good. Good advice. For us.

539
00:31:28,022 --> 00:31:31,389
I got to go take care of
Cathleen and Geoffrey.

540
00:31:34,462 --> 00:31:36,293
So we think we found something.

541
00:31:36,364 --> 00:31:39,527
It's a new procedure
called Testicular Sperm Extraction.

542
00:31:39,601 --> 00:31:42,365
- OK. What's that ?
- Sperm search and rescue.

543
00:31:42,437 --> 00:31:46,100
We go inside the testicle
to look for a few viable sperm

544
00:31:46,174 --> 00:31:49,143
which we implant
into Cathleen's eggs to make a child.

545
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:50,973
- You can do that ?
- Yes.

546
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:54,515
We use a surgical microscope
to isolate sperm producing tissue.

547
00:31:54,582 --> 00:31:57,244
If we find even one sperm,
we have a shot.

548
00:31:57,318 --> 00:32:00,947
This is so frigging cool !
It's like Rambo time.

549
00:32:02,023 --> 00:32:04,116
- Inside my testicles.
- Yes.

550
00:32:04,192 --> 00:32:05,284
Yeah.

551
00:32:11,466 --> 00:32:13,491
I know why you've been avoiding me.

552
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,694
- What ?
- It's...

553
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:20,967
I... [sighs] owe you an apology.

554
00:32:21,042 --> 00:32:23,408
- You do ?
- Yes.

555
00:32:23,478 --> 00:32:28,438
I was stupid to think we could have
unemotional sex, or attempted sex.

556
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:31,713
We care about each other.
We're friends.

557
00:32:31,786 --> 00:32:36,120
Friends with benefits never works.
I was wrong.

558
00:32:37,926 --> 00:32:39,894
- Thank you.
- So it was the sex ?

559
00:32:39,994 --> 00:32:42,895
- That's why you've been avoiding me ?
- It was the sex.

560
00:32:42,964 --> 00:32:45,899
Good. So we're good ?

561
00:32:45,967 --> 00:32:48,731
- We're good.
- Good.

562
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,307
OK, Geoffrey,

563
00:32:53,374 --> 00:32:58,744
once we get inside, you may feel
a slight pulling or discomfort.

564
00:32:58,847 --> 00:33:01,077
If it gets too bad we can stop.

565
00:33:01,149 --> 00:33:05,313
And then, if Dr. Montgomery locates
any sperm, I'll extract Cathleen's eggs.

566
00:33:06,087 --> 00:33:07,452
You can do this, honey.

567
00:33:08,389 --> 00:33:09,515
I love you, babe.

568
00:33:10,525 --> 00:33:12,390
OK. On three.

569
00:33:14,195 --> 00:33:18,495
One... two... three.

570
00:33:24,005 --> 00:33:27,099
OK. I'm going inside.

571
00:33:27,175 --> 00:33:29,735
Taking a look around.

572
00:33:29,844 --> 00:33:34,781
Trying to find that one swimmer.

573
00:33:36,084 --> 00:33:37,949
What if she doesn't find anything ?

574
00:33:38,019 --> 00:33:41,580
- What if there's nothing there ?
- I love you no matter what.

575
00:33:47,028 --> 00:33:48,859
What's going on ?

576
00:33:49,364 --> 00:33:51,389
The hospital just called.

577
00:33:51,466 --> 00:33:53,900
I've got to go get my... Wendell.

578
00:33:54,869 --> 00:33:56,427

579
00:34:05,647 --> 00:34:06,875

580
00:34:09,517 --> 00:34:11,212

Got it.

587
00:34:35,143 --> 00:34:37,976

- Hold on a minute. We're checking.

588
00:34:40,648 --> 00:34:41,910
Yeah. There you go.

It was shot.

00:34:54,996 --> 00:34:57,760
- It wasn't me ?
- No. No.

593
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,827
He was living on borrowed time.

594
00:35:03,204 --> 00:35:06,935
I'm sorry.
I know he was your friend.

595
00:35:07,909 --> 00:35:10,275
Nate lost his wife too.

596
00:35:10,378 --> 00:35:13,006
And then, he was at the home.

597
00:35:13,781 --> 00:35:16,648
You want to know why we fight ?
I'll tell you why.

598
00:35:16,718 --> 00:35:19,084
On those days, you wake up thinking,

599
00:35:19,187 --> 00:35:24,523
"Today something happens
besides this death march."

600
00:35:26,127 --> 00:35:29,426
Our lives, they change.

601
00:35:30,264 --> 00:35:32,232
Fair enough, we're old.

602
00:35:33,501 --> 00:35:35,264
But they don't have to be over.

603
00:35:36,871 --> 00:35:40,898

To fight.

605
00:35:44,545 --> 00:35:46,206
I hate bingo.

606
00:35:47,582 --> 00:35:49,447
So did Nate.

607

Your grandma, she was what I lived for.

00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:58,021
You'll see, when you're like me.

609
00:35:59,494 --> 00:36:02,588
You'll wish you'd fought more
your whole life.

610
00:36:02,664 --> 00:36:07,158
You'll miss caring
that much about anything.

611
00:36:47,408 --> 00:36:49,171
I think we just made a baby.

612
00:36:57,385 --> 00:36:59,717
Hey. You want to grab a bite ?

613
00:36:59,787 --> 00:37:02,312
I can come to your house.
Get a pizza, movie.

I'm hardly...

It's not a big thing.

Exactly. So don't be a freak.

00:37:39,861 --> 00:37:42,227
Right. You're right.

625
00:37:43,998 --> 00:37:45,090
Go.

00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,565
Don't stand her up.

627
00:37:55,977 --> 00:38:00,243
Relax. Give that one guy
a chance to settle in.

628
00:38:00,314 --> 00:38:02,407

- Yeah.

it's worth slugging it out.

00:40:13,948 --> 00:40:16,849
I don't have it all together, OK ?

663
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:19,746
But I'm not a kid.

664
00:40:21,555 --> 00:40:24,524
I'm a man who loves you.

665
00:40:24,625 --> 00:40:26,650
Who's going to fight for you.

666
00:40:39,774 --> 00:40:42,402
Hey. Have you seen Addison ? I need to...

667
00:41:00,394 --> 00:41:03,522
OK ? I don't care.

668
00:41:04,398 --> 00:41:06,229
Let everybody know.

669
00:41:11,906 --> 00:41:14,170
What was that ?

670
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:18,178
He's fighting for her.

671
00:41:20,281 --> 00:41:21,805
She's worth it.

672
00:41:34,061 --> 00:41:35,426
- Hello.
- Hi.

673
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:39,457
I am here to see Officer Nelson.
Kevin Nelson.

674
00:41:39,533 --> 00:41:42,502
- I'm a friend.
- Let's see if I can find him.

675
00:41:53,114 --> 00:41:55,207
[Rings doorbell]

676
00:41:59,186 --> 00:42:00,813
Addison ?
