00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:14,917
He's not talking to me.

3
00:00:14,959 --> 00:00:16,166
I'm not not talking.

4
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:18,417
He's barely talking.

5
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:21,375
I was married...
Long time ago.

6
00:00:21,417 --> 00:00:24,041
I told him,
but he seems to think

7
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:27,625
I didn't tell him
soon enough.
Well, that's...

8
00:00:27,667 --> 00:00:29,834
None of my business.

9
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:37,834
Hello.

10
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:39,375
Hello.

11
00:00:39,417 --> 00:00:40,834
Hello.

12
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:43,667
Oh, I thought
we were saying hello.

13
00:00:43,709 --> 00:00:45,625
We're not.

14
00:00:45,667 --> 00:00:47,166
Kitten.

15
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:49,875
My name is Addison.

16
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:53,041
I thought
we could have a drink.
It's 9:00 A.M.

17
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:56,041
Well,
I thought we could talk.
Are you dying?

18
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:59,208
What?
Do you have cancer,
renal failure, a brain tumor?

19
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,458
Are you you dying?
I came to see you.

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,834
Well, here I am.
You saw me.

21
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:06,875
So now you're leaving?

22
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:09,959
You are.

23
00:01:13,917 --> 00:01:17,208
I'm at the Carlyle.

24
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:23,917
Come on, Dr. Wilder.

25
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,917
It's not as bad as it looks.
The cancer has spread

26
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:28,041
from your abdomen
to your liver to your lungs,

27
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:29,458
and you've kept
your optimism.

28
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,041
My colon's good...

29
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:33,083
Like a teenage vegetarian.

30
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:35,500
Neil?

31
00:01:35,542 --> 00:01:38,208
All my tests are perfect.

32
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,041
The baby looks good.

33
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:43,041
And Dr. Montgomery assures me
it's a girl.

34
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:45,709
So you better revise
your list of names.

35
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,709
There's nothing wrong
with a girl named Doug.

36
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,083
Besides, doctors are wrong
all the time.

37
00:01:53,542 --> 00:01:57,041
All right, Pete, you know what
the blood has to tell you.

38
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:59,709
I need six weeks.

39
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,000
I need to be there.
I need to hold our little girl.

40
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:05,041
Well, it's like I said,
mind over matter.

41
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:09,041
Your attitude is great. There's
nothing more I could ask for.
Well, I'm asking.

42
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:12,041
I'm asking for more.
I know you can't save him,

43
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:14,041
but... I need you to tell me

44
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:17,041
he's gonna be alive
when she's born.

45
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:21,333
I need my little girl
to have a father.

46
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:28,041
She has taken a lover.

47
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:29,333
A lovah.

48
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,667
And he's old?
Good-lookin' old.

49
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:34,041
But from the way
she looked at him,

50
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:36,041
I'd say he's not
her lover anymore.

51
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:39,125
She never said anything
about a guy.

52
00:02:43,417 --> 00:02:46,709
I am not talking about it.

53
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,000
So, uh, everybody have
a good weekend?

54
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:51,625
Well, I did--good weekend.
It was very eventful.

55
00:02:51,667 --> 00:02:53,917
Got married.

56
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:56,917
Uh, I know what
you're gonna say.

57
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,959
Uh, it's--it's fast
and--and crazy--
whoa. Where'd you meet her?

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,500
I-I didn't. Uh...
I married Heather.

59
00:03:02,542 --> 00:03:05,041
I know what you want to say,
but I know what I'm doing,

60
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:07,333
and--and she's cleaned up,

61
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:10,041
and--and Betsey's really happy,
really happy.

62
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:13,000
So it's great. I had
a--i had a great weekend.

63
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:19,041
Where is my son?

64
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,792
Evan Dawson. I'm his mother,
Lynn jarvey.

65
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:24,625
I'm sorry. I don't--
my son was kidnapped.
You saw him.

66
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:32,417
You treated him here, and I
think you know where he is.

67
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:34,417
Uh, yes,
I did treat him...

68
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:36,041
A while ago,

69
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,417
and I don't--

70
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,417
it wasn't Evan, though.
Is it maybe Porter?

71
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:42,458
He may have told you that,
but that is my son.

72
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,000
His father kidnapped him,
and I want him back.
Wow. Um, I'm sorry.

73
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,458
I hired
a private investigator

74
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,458
who says you traced
his Insulin pump.

75
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,709
You called his pediatrician
from this office.

76
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,458
You knew he was kidnapped
before he was hospitalized.

77
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,458
Mrs. Jarvey,
let me assure you,

78
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,041
I treated your son,
and then he left.

79
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:03,041
I don't know anything
about a call.
I don't believe you.

80
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,709
You didn't believe
your son either.

81
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,041
From what I remember,
this boy told me

82
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,917
he was being abused
by his stepfather.

83
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,083
I'm assuming
that's your husband.
You may think that you're
helping my son,

84
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,709
but you don't know me
or my husband,

85
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,041
and I'm telling you,
this did not happen.

86
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,041
I am his mother.
I would know.

87
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:25,041
Evan is a 13-year-old boy
with severe diabetes

88
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,625
who got an infection

89
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:28,750
because he was living
in his father's car.

90
00:04:28,792 --> 00:04:32,083
Who knows
how they're living now?

91
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,458
Please, Dr. Freedman,
if you know something...

92
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,500
I don't want my son
to die.

93
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:40,000
I wish I could help.
I'm sorry.

94
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:52,458
Damn it.

95
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,041
Problem?

96
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,750
My patient is dying.

97
00:04:55,792 --> 00:04:58,750
His wife is due in six weeks,
and he's running out of time.

98
00:04:58,792 --> 00:05:01,750
Intra-abdominal sarcoma
with liver and lung mets.

99
00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:04,041
Well...

100
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:06,375
He has a few weeks
at best.

101
00:05:06,417 --> 00:05:09,083
What I thought.
Unless you want to try
something new.

102
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,375
What, prayer?
No.

103
00:05:11,417 --> 00:05:13,083
Better. Me.

104
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,458
Okay, sacrilegious, maybe.

105
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,458
But I've been working on
some new procedures

106
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,166
to inhibit tumor growth.

107
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:22,542
Maybe give your patient
enough time to meet his baby.
Neil delhom?

108
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:25,375
It's that bad? I just saw him
and Margaret in the lobby.
It's that bad.

109
00:05:25,417 --> 00:05:30,208
But I want to make it better.
I have read your protocols
on tumor inhibitors.

110
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,208
They're not without
side effects.
What kind of side effects
are we talking about?

111
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,000
They run the gamut,

112
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,000
but bottom line is,
your patient's dying.

113
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:42,166
I can give him a better
quality of life than death.

114
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,000
Going somewhere?

115
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:46,166
Out.

116
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,959
You may not
want to talk to me,

117
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,166
but I remember Evan Dawson
from a year ago

118
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,166
when I covered for you.
And?

119
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:56,208
And if you know where they are,
turn them in.

120
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:00,208
I don't and I handled it.
I gotta go.

121
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,583
Basically,
I put a radio transmitter

122
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,041
into your liver

123
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:06,959
and use a probe
to heat up the tumor

124
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,125
- and blast the cancer cells.
- Margaret.

125
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:12,125
I know this is a lot
to digest.

126
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:18,041
We spent two years
trying to have this baby--

127
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:21,458
hormones and needles
and doctors telling us,

128
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,542
"that's all I can do."

129
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,917
Now we're having the baby...

130
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:32,583
It's just not fair...

131
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:36,375
What's happening to Neil.

132
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:40,041
This...
This c--this can help?

133
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:43,250
All our preliminary studies
are excellent.

134
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:46,917
And you're recommending this?

135
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:49,250
I'm...

136
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,041
I'm concerned.

137
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:54,709
I-I want to throw everything
that we can at this,

138
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,041
but I also want whatever time
that you have to be... livable

139
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,875
for both of you.

140
00:07:00,917 --> 00:07:03,291
Pete?

141
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,333
Well, you asked for more time,

142
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,333
for your daughter
to have a father.

143
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,917
Dr. Fife...

144
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:16,125
He's your only shot.
I say take it.

145
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,333
It's cool.
We're studying robotics.

146
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,291
Wow. That's big-time.

147
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:28,250
Uh, the pump looks good.
It's clean.

148
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,834
You do have a slight fever,
though, so I'm just gonna--

149
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:33,333
I'm gonna take a little blood.
It might be an infection.
Okay.

150
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,917
How you feeling otherwise?
A little tired,
but mostly good.

151
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:39,000
You can have a taco on me.
You want me to get lost?

152
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,250
Kinda, yeah.

153
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:43,291
You just--
just give us a minute, bud.

154
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:50,500
So, um,
this isn't just a house call.

155
00:07:50,542 --> 00:07:52,041
No.

156
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:55,041
Uh, Lynn came to see me.

157
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:58,041
Does she know we're here?
Does she know we're in L.A.?
I don't think so,

158
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,583
but she hired
a private investigator.

159
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:02,333
She thinks I know something.
We have to leave.
We have to leave L.A.

160
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,333
I didn't say anything to her,
and I won't.

161
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:08,375
You don't have to run
on my account.

162
00:08:08,417 --> 00:08:12,542
We're settled, you know?
We're making a life.

163
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:15,333
Is she still with Ted?
Yes.

164
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:21,166
How can a woman choose
a man over her own son?

165
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:25,417
I don't... I...

166
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:28,041
So just be careful, frank.

167
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:32,291
I'll let you know if anything
comes back on these labs.

168
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:35,041
A marriage intervention?

169
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,750
That's why we're here?
Is there even such a thing?

170
00:08:37,792 --> 00:08:39,291
It's codependence, Pete.

171
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,291
Dell is facilitating
her addiction

172
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,333
by taking her back
every time she gets clean.

173
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,333
And there's a child
at stake.

174
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:48,333
I still can't believe it.
I mean, Dell is married.

175
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:51,333
Is he happy?
I-I think he's in denial.

176
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,417
He married the mother
of his child.

177
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,667
Couldn't that be a good thing?

178
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:58,250
Okay, I have a patient
who actually needs some help.

179
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:01,041
Pete, will you...

180
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,041
Keep an eye on Dr. Fife?

181
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,041
He worries me.
He worries me, too,

182
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,417
but I don't see
any other options.

183
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:12,417
So are you in?

184
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:17,041
Oh, there he is. Hey, hey.
Where were you?
Hi.

185
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:20,083
What? Uh, nowhere. I was just,
you know, doing a thing.
You ready to talk to Dell?

186
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:23,291
Oh, yeah, sure.
No time like the present.
Don't tell me
you're getting involved.

187
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:25,458
It's Dell.

188
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,667
Hi.

189
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:31,417
So I hear congratulations
are in order.

190
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,000
Wow.

191
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,458
Thanks.

192
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,208
Something you wanted?

193
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:40,208
Can we talk to you
for a minute?

194
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,458
Cooper Freedman?

195
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,625
Uh, yeah, hi.
I'm Dr. Freedman.
We have a warrant
for your arrest.

196
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:48,291
Please put your hands
behind your back, sir.
No, no, no.

197
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,959
There--there must be
a mistake, officer.
What's going on?

198
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,959
You have the right
to remain silent.

199
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,458
Anything you say can and will
be used against you...
I'm okay. I'm okay.

200
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,542
I'll call the lawyer.
I'll be right there.
...If you cannot
afford a lawyer,

201
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,959
one will be appointed to
represent you before any...

202
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:08,041
This is a printout
of all the calls

203
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:11,041
to Lynn jarvey's cell phone
in the past two hours.

204
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:14,041
The last one came from
a pay phone here in L.A.

205
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,834
From her son Evan.

206
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:18,041
He asked his mom
to stop looking for him

207
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,875
so you and his dad
wouldn't get into trouble.

208
00:10:20,917 --> 00:10:22,083
You've given
material assistance

209
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,125
to aid and abet
a kidnapper.

210
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:27,375
Carries a sentence in California
of 5 to 11 years.

211
00:10:27,417 --> 00:10:30,959
I'm not entirely sure what
it does to your medical license,

212
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,375
but I'm thinking
it can't be good.

213
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:36,542
I don't want you.

214
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:41,291
Tell me where her son is,
I let you go.

215
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:46,000
I think I'm gonna wait
for my lawyer.

216
00:10:55,792 --> 00:10:59,000
There's really evidence
in a box of tongue depressors?

217
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,083
All right,
so give me a call.

218
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,542
What do they want?

219
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:09,125
They think that Cooper
knows where this kid is,

220
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:12,125
that he's been in contact
with him.
This is ridiculous.
It's been a year.

221
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,750
Yes, but it's Cooper.

222
00:11:14,792 --> 00:11:17,041
Do you really think
they're wrong?

223
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:19,041
I don't know.

224
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:22,500
Uh, Cooper did know that
the boy was kidnapped

225
00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:25,041
when he was here last year.

226
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:28,000
He traced
the boy's Insulin pump.
And you knew about this?

227
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:31,041
Well, it was his patient,
so it's his call.
Doesn't mean he knows
where they are now.

228
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:33,542
Well, look, Charlotte is
with the lawyers right now.

229
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,041
They're gonna
work something out.

230
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:38,041
Cooper gave medical service
to a patient who needed it.

231
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,792
That's what
he's supposed to do.

232
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:43,041
What jury is gonna
convict him for that?

233
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:51,041
It's almost in place.

234
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,083
Grab that. Steady it.

235
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,125
You and Dr. Bennett
are from

236
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,041
the warm-and-fuzzy school
of medicine.

237
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:01,125
I'm from
the get-things-done school.

238
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:04,208
No reason you can't do both.
Is that why you took
my side over Naomi's?

239
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,709
Move to the left.

240
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,041
My left.

241
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,917
Actually, I was...

242
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,417
Concerned about what was
best for my patient.
And Naomi isn't.

243
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,417
I'm not putting words
in your mouth.

244
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,041
Just following the logic.

245
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,041
Dr. Bennett
cares about her patients,

246
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:22,083
but she sometimes cares more
about getting her way,

247
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,709
at least when it comes to me.
I hadn't noticed.

248
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,709
Yes, you did.

249
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:31,166
Now sit back
and watch science in action.

250
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,083
It's gonna be fine.

251
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:35,083
Just bail me out,
and my lawyer

252
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:38,125
is gonna figure out a way
to get me outta this.
They won't set bail

253
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:41,250
until after the grand jury
hearing tomorrow.

254
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:45,125
I'm sorry.

255
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:48,458
I'm not worried
about me being in jail.

256
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,041
It's Evan. He might have
a kidney infection.

257
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,250
You saw him and you lied?
Lower your voice.

258
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:56,041
Oh, it's okay when you lie?
You lying about your marriage

259
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:59,125
and me helping a patient,
it's completely different.

260
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:01,875
You're in jail, Cooper.
Give this kid up.

261
00:13:01,917 --> 00:13:05,625
I can't send Evan back to
his stepfather to get abused.

262
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:07,709
If he's sick,
he's gonna need antibiotics

263
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,583
before he winds up
needing to be hospitalized.
No.

264
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:13,000
I need you to pick up
his labs--

265
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:16,125
I am not committing a felony
to protect your patient.
I need you
to pick up his labs,

266
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:19,041
and I will get him
whatever he needs

267
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:22,375
as soon
as I get bailed out.

268
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:24,333
You owe me this.

269
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,875
Hi. You want to
close the door and sit down?

270
00:13:27,917 --> 00:13:31,041
An intervention?
We're really doing this?

271
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:35,166
Well, we were both there
when Heather took Betsey.

272
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:39,458
And we were there
when she came back on drugs.

273
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,583
We saw what that did to you.

274
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,291
So--so this, um,
this "marriage,"

275
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,291
this is part
of your pattern with Heather.

276
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:49,083
She--she gets you to trust her,
and then her addiction kicks in,

277
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,792
and then you get hurt.

278
00:13:50,834 --> 00:13:53,041
And I-I know
how difficult it's been

279
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:56,166
for you to balance working
and being a single father--
oh, oh, yeah.

280
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,166
Sometimes,
when we get overwhelmed,

281
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:01,041
we look for the easy answer.
Yeah.

282
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:04,041
Trust me. It hasn't been easy,
okay? We've been working on it.
Yeah, well,
you kept it secret.

283
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:07,041
Yeah, 'cause I knew
you wouldn't approve.
Okay.

284
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:10,125
Look, s-sometimes it's hard to
hear advice from other people.

285
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:13,208
Yeah, yeah.
It--it's scary. But--but you
at least need to listen.

286
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,500
Y-You think I should take
relationship advice

287
00:14:15,542 --> 00:14:18,667
from you, Violet, really,
about what's best for my child,

288
00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:21,542
about whether or not I should
be with someone that I love?

289
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:24,166
Dell--
i'm--I'm not sleeping
with my colleague's brother.

290
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:27,333
I'm not getting divorced
and--and leaving my job.

291
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,834
I married
my daughter's mother.

292

Now... I appreciate
that you care,

293
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,458
but I need to get home
to my wife.

294
00:14:39,834 --> 00:14:42,041
That went well.
Yeah. Yeah, that was--
that was good.

to get the captain to fire up
the old jet and come on out.

Well, uh...
I see you have changed.

I'm a whole new girl.
Does bizzy know you're here?

325
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:23,375
There was a point when you
liked spending time with me.
I told you the last time,
I'm done. I was finished.

326
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:26,125
And then you have the nerve
to come back--
that was just an argument.

327
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:29,125
No, that was me
getting away from you.
I can't imagine why

four of my nannies,

331

three maids,

Louise, the chef?

333

510
00:25:29,417 --> 00:25:31,375
So Dell told you
about that.

511
00:25:31,417 --> 00:25:33,041
Yeah, he told me.

512
00:25:33,083 --> 00:25:35,375
He didn't want to, but, um,
no secrets.

513
00:25:35,417 --> 00:25:39,041
It's part of the program.
I can't live that way.

514
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:41,000
That's good.

515
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:43,667
Look... I understand.

516
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:47,417
I'm the first one to tell you,
this is scary.

517
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:50,542
I mean, we were both worried
that it was too soon.

518
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:53,000
I know
I have to earn his trust.

519
00:25:53,041 --> 00:25:55,041
But I love him,

520
00:25:55,083 --> 00:25:56,834
and he loves me,

521
00:25:56,875 --> 00:25:59,125
and Betsey is happy.

522
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:02,834
And that's the most important
thing, isn't it?

523
00:26:04,417 --> 00:26:06,250
Well, um, i'm--
I'm not sure it is.

524
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:09,375
I mean, she's a child whose
family was broken apart.

525
00:26:09,417 --> 00:26:12,000
So of course she's happy
to see you together again.

526
00:26:12,041 --> 00:26:14,250
But you don't think I'm safe.

527
00:26:14,291 --> 00:26:17,250
I--i'm... I'm worried
about all of you.

528
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:19,041
I'm afraid, too.

529
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:22,375
Not a day goes by
that I don't think about using.

530
00:26:22,417 --> 00:26:26,041
But when I was in rehab,
I thought a lot about...

531
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:28,375
When Betsey was born.

532
00:26:28,417 --> 00:26:33,041
And I was clean, I was happy,
and we were a family.

533
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:35,125
When I'm with her
and when I'm with Dell,

534
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:37,041
I'm at my best.

535
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:39,041
I think I can do this.

536
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:41,667
I-I want to do this...

537
00:26:41,709 --> 00:26:44,000
Because they're
the best part of me.

538
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:50,041
Look, I have to get
to the meeting, so--

539
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:52,333
oh, of course, of course.
I'm, uh...

540
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:55,041
I'm sorry
to have bothered you, Heather.

541
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:57,125
All right, bye.

542
00:27:01,375 --> 00:27:03,208
Did you not understand
what was happening?

543
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:06,208
Did you not understand
that I had made a choice?

544
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,166
I understood

545
00:27:08,208 --> 00:27:10,500
that you chose
to break several laws,

546
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:12,375
putting yourself,
your girlfriend

547
00:27:12,417 --> 00:27:15,291
and this entire practice
at risk.
I confided in you, Addison.

548
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:18,583
I didn't ask for your help.
No. You were having
moral qualms,

549
00:27:18,625 --> 00:27:21,166
and I saw you coming down
on the wrong side of them.

550
00:27:21,208 --> 00:27:23,166
You gave Evan
to his abusive stepfather.

551
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:26,166
He was terrified. You put him
into the hands of his attacker.

552
00:27:26,208 --> 00:27:28,959
I have to trust that
the courts will sort it out.

553
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,709
It's not mine to do or yours,
either of yours.
Oh, you are not that naive.

554
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,667
They're not gonna get it,
the father goes to jail,

555
00:27:34,709 --> 00:27:37,458
and this kid gets beaten,
and our practice is okay.

556
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,333
Yay, us.
Cooper, enough.

557
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:42,542
Hey, are you in on this, Sam?
I'm not taking sides.

558
00:27:42,583 --> 00:27:45,709
Well, I did. I took a side.
So did I,
and I'd do it again.

559
00:28:01,834 --> 00:28:05,125
Addison, this--
we need you to deliver
Margaret delhom's baby

560
00:28:05,166 --> 00:28:07,417
before her husband dies.

561
00:28:07,458 --> 00:28:11,166
Uh, Gabriel fife.
Heard great things about you.
Yeah, uh, Addison Montgomery.
What happened?

562
00:28:11,208 --> 00:28:13,458
Dr. Fife tried
an experimental treatment.

563
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,041
It didn't work.
Neil doesn't have much time.

564
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:19,959
Margaret still has six weeks
left. I can't deliver yet.
Babies come in at 34 weeks
all the time.

565
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Do an amnio, check the lungs.

566
00:28:22,041 --> 00:28:24,000
If they're mature,
what's the problem?

567
00:28:24,041 --> 00:28:26,041
The problem, Dr. Fife,
is that human fetuses

568
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:30,041
are supposed to grow to 40 weeks
before we yank them out.
You yank them out?

569
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:33,041
You know, I thought the great
thing about being a doctor

570
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:35,834
was we could make things happen
that should happen.

571
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:39,583
Well... he's fun.

572
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:42,041
Are you really
on board with this?
I don't know.

573
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:44,041
Neil wants to meet
his daughter.

574
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:46,041
Margaret wants to be able
to tell that baby

575
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:48,041
that her father held her
and loved her.

576
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:50,166
And that baby,
she's gonna want to know it.

577
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:54,417
And I know all the reasons we
shouldn't deliver the baby now.

578
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:58,041
But I keep thinking about...
When Violet was attacked

579
00:28:58,083 --> 00:29:01,000
and how I didn't know
if I'd ever meet Lucas.

580
00:29:01,041 --> 00:29:03,917
I didn't know
if I'd ever meet my son.

581
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:06,208
And I know...

582
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:09,917
That I would've done anything
to meet him.

583
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:14,083
Easy.

584
00:29:17,125 --> 00:29:18,875
Jail sucked, Sam.

585
00:29:18,917 --> 00:29:22,083
It sucked,
and it was for nothing.

586
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:25,458
Well, coulda been worse.

587
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:30,041
It wasn't worse.

588
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:31,917
Well, that's good.

589
00:29:31,959 --> 00:29:33,125
Yeah.

590
00:29:33,166 --> 00:29:34,917
That's good.

591
00:29:34,959 --> 00:29:36,125
Ow.

592
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:38,959
Hello.

593
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,417
Evan?

594
00:29:40,458 --> 00:29:43,417
I know Evan says I stabbed him,
but I didn't.

595
00:29:43,458 --> 00:29:45,500
I told you,
I didn't hurt him.

596
00:29:45,542 --> 00:29:48,208
You left your son alone with his abuser?
 No.

597
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:51,250
Get out of my way.
No, you're not touching
my son.

598
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:53,875
Me? You're worried about me?
I told you.

599
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:56,792
You didn't believe me.
You didn't believe Evan.
I screwed up.
I screwed up, okay?

600
00:29:56,834 --> 00:29:58,792
But you're not touching him.
Just...

601
00:29:58,834 --> 00:30:01,458
I got this. Okay. I'm sorry.
Uh, I'm Dr. Sam Bennett.

602
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,458
I understand
how you must be feeling.

603
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,041
Let me just go in there
and give your son

604
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:08,041
the best medical treatment
he could get.

605
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:12,125
Okay? Please.
Just let me help your son.

606
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,667
Are they gonna let
my dad outta jail?

607
00:30:21,709 --> 00:30:24,959
Uh, I don't know. But right now,
I'm concerned about you.

608
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,041
Am I... gonna be okay?

609
00:30:27,083 --> 00:30:28,291
Absolutely.

610
00:30:29,625 --> 00:30:33,000
Dr. Bennett?

611
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:40,041
Get me 4-0 nylon,
1% lido with epi

612
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:42,250
and a suture kit.

613
00:30:44,834 --> 00:30:47,375
It's one thing coming after me.
I can tell you to back off.

614
00:30:47,417 --> 00:30:50,125
But going to my wife
is inexcusable.
I-I came to see you.

615
00:30:50,166 --> 00:30:53,041
Well, then you shoulda
walked away.
I am so sorry
if I upset her. I--

616
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:55,792
no, you upset me, all right?
I mean, maybe--maybe I hid it.

617
00:30:55,834 --> 00:30:57,792
Maybe I should've
let all of you know

618
00:30:57,834 --> 00:30:59,792
when we started seeing
each other, but I didn't,

619
00:30:59,834 --> 00:31:02,208
because I was trying to figure
out how I was feeling by myself.
I get that.

620
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,041
Everyone gave you space

621
00:31:04,083 --> 00:31:06,041
when you were trying
to figure out what you wanted.

622
00:31:06,083 --> 00:31:07,875
Besides Pete, no one
got in your business

623
00:31:07,917 --> 00:31:09,625
about the choices
you've been making about Lucas,

624
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:11,625
choices, by the way,
which we don't all support--

625
00:31:11,667 --> 00:31:13,875
you giving up your child.
But we, you know, we love you

626
00:31:13,917 --> 00:31:16,125
and we respect you,
and we know this has been tough,

627
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,125
and we're just trying
to be supportive.

628
00:31:18,166 --> 00:31:20,875
So if--if you don't like
what I did, it's fine. Okay?

629
00:31:20,917 --> 00:31:23,125
But respect it. If you can
respect Cooper for--for

630
00:31:23,166 --> 00:31:25,959
committing a crime and putting
his career on the line,

631
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,959
I would think
you could respect me.

632
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:32,542
You want me to tell Cooper?

633
00:31:32,583 --> 00:31:34,166
I will.

634
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:36,208
Give me a minute
to talk to Evan.
All right.

635
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:40,250
Now you said your stepfather
did this to you.

636
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:42,250
But your wounds
are all even, Evan,

637
00:31:42,291 --> 00:31:44,166
and they're superficial.

638
00:31:44,208 --> 00:31:46,583
They're called
intention marks.

639
00:31:46,625 --> 00:31:49,166
There's no way
he did this to you.

640
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:51,375
You did this to yourself.

641
00:31:51,417 --> 00:31:54,458
Why would you hurt yourself?

642
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,291
If I had proof...

643
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:03,041
That Ted hurt me...

644
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:07,208
They'd have to let my dad
outta jail.

645
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:10,208
You can't tell anyone.

646
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:12,041
Please.

647
00:32:12,083 --> 00:32:16,291
You want Ted to go to jail?
Let's find real evidence.

648
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:19,750
Tell me what he did to you.
Tell me everything.

649
00:32:19,792 --> 00:32:22,083
We'll take x-rays,
find proof.

650
00:32:22,125 --> 00:32:26,083
We will put
that son of a bitch in jail.

651
00:32:26,125 --> 00:32:29,875
You can tell me. Anything.

652
00:32:29,917 --> 00:32:31,458
I can't.

653
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,291
Why not?

654
00:32:33,333 --> 00:32:36,500
I didn't mean
for all this to happen.

655
00:32:36,542 --> 00:32:39,041
I just wanted Ted
to go away.

656
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:41,542
So I told my mom
Ted hit me.

657
00:32:41,583 --> 00:32:45,041
It was one lie
to keep my parents together.

658
00:32:45,083 --> 00:32:49,041
Only my dad believed me,
and she didn't.

659
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:51,500
So he took me away.

660
00:32:51,542 --> 00:32:55,250
And once I started,
I-I didn't know how to stop.

661
00:32:55,291 --> 00:32:58,709
So I kept lying and lying.

662
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:01,041
I didn't know
what else to do.

663
00:33:03,709 --> 00:33:06,792
I-I didn't know
what else to do.

664
00:33:12,208 --> 00:33:14,166
- Aah!
- That's good, Margaret.

665
00:33:14,208 --> 00:33:17,208
Okay, one more push. Ready?
On the count of three.
Good, good, good.

666
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:19,542
One, two... and three.
Push.
Push.

667
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:22,333
Push.

668
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,834
Okay. Great.
There she is.

669
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:34,125
Is she okay?

670
00:33:37,417 --> 00:33:39,583
She's perfect.

671
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,125
Evan's okay.

672
00:33:50,166 --> 00:33:53,458
Turns out, uh, his wounds
were superficial.

673
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:57,000
Intention wounds.

674
00:33:57,041 --> 00:33:58,458
He faked 'em, Cooper,

675
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,750
