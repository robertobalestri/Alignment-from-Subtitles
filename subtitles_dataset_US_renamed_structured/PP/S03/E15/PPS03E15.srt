00:00:03,291 --> 00:00:05,083
♪ Ohhh ohhh ohhh ♪

2
00:00:09,333 --> 00:00:11,709
This music, it's so...

3
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,083
Is that a review
or a contraction?

4
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:17,291
Both.

5
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:20,041
It's resonance therapy.

6
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:21,625
Combined with acupuncture,

7
00:00:21,667 --> 00:00:24,000
it's gonna get those
contractions under control

8
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:26,000
and make you feel
more comfortable.

9
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:29,041
Well, it's a good thing Matthew
couldn't make it today...

10
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:31,041
Because he would hate this.
It's soothing.

11
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:32,458
Okay.

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,458
You know, when Dr. Bennett
did the I.V.F.,

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,041
she let us bring in
our own c.D.
What'd you put on?

14
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:39,625
Well, the first time we just
picked all these songs

15
00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:41,625
that we used to love
in high school.

16
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,625
And then...
The second time

17
00:00:43,667 --> 00:00:46,250
we used this muzak that was
supposed to relax me,

18
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:49,000
but just made me feel
like I was having

19
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:51,375
a gynecological appointment
in an elevator.

20
00:00:51,417 --> 00:00:54,500
And then the third time,
we just picked every song

21
00:00:54,542 --> 00:00:57,625
that we could think of with
the word "luck" in the title.
And it worked.

22
00:00:57,667 --> 00:00:59,041
Ah.
You okay?

23
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:00,625
Don't worry.

24
00:01:00,667 --> 00:01:03,083
It's just--it's been like this
the past couple of mornings.

25
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:06,000
I think baby Langston does not
like breakfast burritos.

26
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:09,500
Okay. You start your torture,
and I'll just run a tune--ah!

27
00:01:09,542 --> 00:01:12,041
Ah! Ooh.
Okay, hang on.

28
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:13,709
Send Naomi in, please.

29
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,000
Sorry. It's not usually
this bad.

30
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:18,000
Mm.
Okay,
focus on your breathing.

31
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:19,875
Ooh.
Slow and deep.

32
00:01:19,917 --> 00:01:22,000
Shira, what's wrong?

33
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:24,250
Strengthening contractions,
a minute apart.
Oh!

34
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:26,834
Oh, this could be real labor.
At 25 weeks?

35
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:29,291
Can you make it stop?
Well, we can,

36
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:32,750
but we're gonna have to
get you to the hospital.
I'm all wet.

37
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:35,959
I think my water just broke.

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,041
It's blood.

39
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:43,500
Thanks.

40
00:01:43,542 --> 00:01:45,083
Hey.
Hey.

41
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:47,041
I was
just thinking about you.

42
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:49,709
Oh, yeah?
I'm trying to figure out
what to wear to Maya's wedding.

43
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,917
Oh.

44
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:53,041
Uh... whatever.

45
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:55,667
Sam, women don't do well
with "whatever."

46
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:59,875
Well,
what are you gonna wear?

47
00:01:59,917 --> 00:02:01,291
What?

48
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:04,000
Uh, I have a million things
to do to get ready,

49
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,458
and picking out a tie is not
high up on the list.

50
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,375
What is high on the list?

51
00:02:09,417 --> 00:02:11,375
I have to write a toast.

52
00:02:11,417 --> 00:02:14,000
Oh, I'm good at toasts.
Yeah, I know. I know that.

53
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:16,583
I-I knocked on your door
last night,

54
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:19,041
hoping that you could help...
But I-I wasn't home.

55
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:20,250
Yeah.

56
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:23,041
Look, you, uh, you don't
want this to be weird.

57
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,375
And--and I'm trying
to make this not weird.

58
00:02:25,417 --> 00:02:28,458
But, uh, you weren't--
you weren't home.

59
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,583
Yeah. I was... out.

60
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:36,125
Look, Sam,
I'm just gonna say this,

61
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:38,125
and hopefully,
you're gonna understand,

62
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:41,583
and it won't be weird
and...

63
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:43,542
I'm seeing someone.

64
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,000
Addison.

65
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,375
There's an ambulance downstairs.
We need you.

66
00:02:49,417 --> 00:02:51,208
It's an emergency.

67
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's a placental abruption.
This much blood, the placenta
could be completely detached.

68
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:01,834
It's gonna be hard
to control the hemorrhage

69
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:05,041
and get that baby out
fast enough.
Oh, no, please.
He's not ready yet.

70
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:08,041
We're gonna do everything we can
to keep the baby inside.

71
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:10,333
Do you have any terbutaline?
I don't know if we do.

72
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:13,875
The book says that he's
the size of a cucumber.
There's no terbutaline,
no magnesium sulfate.

73
00:03:13,917 --> 00:03:16,041
Can she make it?
I can already feel
the baby's head.

74
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:18,250
No, no, please.
This baby's coming now.

75
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:19,959
No!

76
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:30,041
We're gonna get you into surgery
and get your bleeding stopped.

77
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:32,041
Your husband's on his way.
The baby?

78
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,458
Dr. Montgomery's with him.
He was so small.
Will he be okay?

79
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,375
She's gonna do everything
she can for him.
But will he be okay?

80
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:41,291
I didn't feel... anything

81
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:44,917
'cause the doctor...
And I was counting...

82
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,291
They didn't Nick his brain
or anything, right?
You know, they go in
through the groin

83
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,291
for a hernia repair,
so I doubt it.

84
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:53,041
I just think ike has a little
bit of an anesthesia hangover.

85
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:56,166
Dr. Scott.
Hey. I'm so sorry, buddy.
They made me scrub in

86
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:59,041
on another surgery
right after yours.

87
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,667
Wasn't nearly as cool,
though.
So everything went okay here?

88
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:04,625
Yeah, absolutely.
I sutured in a mesh patch.

89
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:07,041
Gonna last him a lifetime.
Great. So how long is he
gonna be kinda...

90
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,834
Oh, he'll be himself
in an hour or so.
I am myself.

91
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,250
Listen, just let him,
uh, rest a while.

92
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:15,041
I'll swing by and check him.

93
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,959
You're gonna be outta here
before dinner.
Thank you.

94
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,667
Take care.

95
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:23,041
Oh, man, I'll tell you.
I jacked up my back.

96
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,041
I'm sorry to hear that.

97
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:27,875
Yeah, I was playing that,
uh, computer tennis game.

98
00:04:27,917 --> 00:04:30,083
I realize
it's a goofy injury.

99
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,083
But, you know,
the last few days

100
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,500
I've been, uh, eating
fistfuls of ibuprofen

101
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:36,750
just so I can stand up
in the O.R.

102
00:04:36,792 --> 00:04:38,750
Actually, man,
would you mind, uh,

103
00:04:38,792 --> 00:04:41,500
writing me a prescription
for a couple of oxy?

104
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:44,500
Oxy a little heavy
for a gaming injury?
Ah, it's just two or three,

105
00:04:44,542 --> 00:04:46,500
just to get me through
today and tomorrow.

106
00:04:46,542 --> 00:04:50,041
Then I'm gonna take
the weekend off and rest up.

107
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,667
Hey, listen, if--if--ow.

108
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:55,041
If it's a big deal,
don't worry about it.

109
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,166
I'll suck it up.

110
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,041
Hey.

111
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,041
Hey.

112
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:06,291
You want
to grab lunch later,

113
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:09,041
away from here?

114
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:12,250
I can do that.

115
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,291
Oh, hey. You know--

116
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,083
you know Charlotte king,
don't you?

117
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,500
Yeah.

118
00:05:18,542 --> 00:05:20,709
Yeah.

119
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,041
Oh, is he the doc that--

120
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,500
yeah.
Oh, I see.

121
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:28,500
I hope this isn't
gonna be a thing.
It's not a thing.

122
00:05:28,542 --> 00:05:31,291
Okay. Great.

123
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:34,375
I'll call you later.
Mm.

124
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,041
Problem with this?

125
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,500
Not a thing.

126
00:05:38,542 --> 00:05:42,166
You don't rsvp two days
before a wedding.

127
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,083
I'm sorry. My friends
have never done this.

128
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,834
You better watch that tone,
young--

129
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,083
all right. We're gonna
talk about this later.

130
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,083
I don't even care
if they come.

131
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:55,083
If it's gonna be
this big a deal--
enough about the wedding.

132
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:58,875
Well, if you're done,
she has an appointment.

133
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,875
You okay?

134
00:06:07,917 --> 00:06:10,875
He looks like his head
is about to pop off.
Don't tell anybody,
but around here,

135
00:06:10,917 --> 00:06:13,875
it always looks like your dad's
head's about to pop off.

136
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:17,750
I guess I should be happy
he's coming at all.
I'm sorry about your mom.

137
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:20,792
She's making me feel like
I'm doing something wrong.
Did you try
talking to her again?

138
00:06:20,834 --> 00:06:24,041
Well, you know, I-I know
how hard this is.

139
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,458
I mean, I remember.

140
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,500
You know, Heather and her mom,
they never got past it.

141
00:06:28,542 --> 00:06:32,417
But with your mom...
I think you should try again.
I don't think
my dad would like it.

142
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:36,500
He's mad at her.
Well, it's your wedding, Maya.

143
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,208
Does he really need
all of that?

144
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,291
He weighs less than 2 pounds,
so we need to keep him

145
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,500
under the lights to regulate
his body temperature.

146
00:06:45,542 --> 00:06:47,041
We're also trying to correct

147
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,041
a pretty serious
electrolyte imbalance

148
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,875
that's causing convulsions

149
00:06:50,917 --> 00:06:53,458
and exacerbating
a cerebral hemorrhage.
His brain is bleeding?

150
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,041
How can he have
so many problems?

151
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:59,041
25 weeks is just the cusp
of viability.

152
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,291
Addison, his abdomen
is distended.

153
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:04,208
Yeah, we did an X-ray.

154
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:08,000
He has
necrotizing enterocolitis.

155
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,333
I-I don't know
what that is.

156
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,041
It means that

157
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,834
not enough blood is getting
to his digestive tract.

158
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:19,834
His intestines are dying.
Is that something
you can fix?

159
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:22,250
He'd need surgery

160
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:26,125
to try to resect his bowel
and save some of the intestines.

161
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,709
Matthew.

162
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,041
So this surgery...
Can we do it now?

163
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:33,000
Uh, that's up to
Dr. Montgomery.

164
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,125
You need to understand

165
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:40,041
that it wouldn't be
just one surgery.

166
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,542
There would be a whole series
of surgeries.

167
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:46,041
And in between, he would need
to eat through a feeding tube

168
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:49,041
and breathe with the help
of a ventilator.

169
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,583
He'd be suffering.

170
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:53,458
And even if we did manage
to keep him alive,

171
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,333
it's unlikely that we could give
him any kind of normal life.

172
00:07:56,375 --> 00:08:00,083
You need to consider if... this
is something that you want.

173
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:03,375
What's our alternative?

174
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:08,792
Ending his life?

175
00:08:08,834 --> 00:08:10,500
Yes.

176
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:19,041
That's not a life--
shuttling back and forth

177
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:22,041
between the O.R. and nicu,
being kept alive by machines,

178
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,041
his system
overloaded with drugs.

179
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,542
He's their child,

180
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,709
and none of us can say
we know what's gonna happen.

181
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,041
Odds are you're right.
I am right.

182
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:33,083
There have been cases where
severe enterocolitis resolves.
So you're on the side
of miracles now?

183
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,083
I understand why they are,

184
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:38,333
and I'm not gonna
fault them for it.
I am not faulting them,
but...

185
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:39,959
That baby is suffering.

186
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,083
He's only
a couple of hours old,

187
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:44,250
and you can already see it
in his face.

188
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:47,208
You can hear it in his cries.
He's in pain.

189
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,250
Letting go is not giving up.
It would be them

190
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:53,667
putting the baby's best
interests ahead of their own.
Naomi?

191
00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:56,250
You know, kids don't come
with guarantees.

192
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,250
They come with problems.

193
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,875
These problems
can't be solved.

194
00:08:59,917 --> 00:09:01,875
A lot of problems
can't be solved.

195
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:04,000
You just... you learn
to live with it.

196
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:06,250
No one should have to live
with this.

197
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:09,041
No, we're not gonna tell
the coles what to do.

198
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:12,542
They have to decide
what they can live with.
But I'd have to do
the surgery,

199
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:15,166
so I need to decide
what I can live with.

200
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:20,375
Corinne... hey, what are you--
what are you doing here?

201
00:09:20,417 --> 00:09:23,208
Oh, I told Maya I'd pick
her up. She came in to do--

202
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,917
a prenatal appointment.
Yeah, I know.
I'm taking
my daughter-in-law-to-be

203
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,875
on a mini spa day--
massage, facials,

204
00:09:28,917 --> 00:09:31,917
and then a test run
for her makeup and hair.

205
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:34,834
Uh, i--
I'm just trying to
make this special for Maya.

206
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,917
I think the wedding
will be special enough.

207
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,667
Well, if we just go through
the motions,

208
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:42,250
do you really think
it will be?

209
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,834
I-I know this isn't what
you or Naomi wanted.

210
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,000
It's--it's not
what I wanted, either,

211
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,291
but it's
what's going to happen.

212
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:52,041
So I've made peace with it
as best I can,

213
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,041
and now I feel
we should make this

214
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:57,041
as positive an experience
as we can for the kids.

215
00:09:57,083 --> 00:10:00,208
So is Maya here?

216
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,208
It's not a thing,
but the guy's a surgeon.

217
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,875
Who's dating Charlotte.
That has nothing to do
with the fact

218
00:10:05,917 --> 00:10:07,875
that he hit me up
for a prescription.

219
00:10:07,917 --> 00:10:10,041
He barely knows me,
and he's asking me for narcotics

220
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:13,041
that would slow him down,
impair his judgment.
Well, look, look, look.
I am on antidepressants.

221
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,291
Sometimes it makes it hard
to focus, which is not ideal

222
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:18,041
when I'm in therapy.
Sam's on allergy meds.

223
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,750
When he ups his dose,
it knocks him out.

224
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:23,125
You just have to hope that
someone's gonna be responsible.

225
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:26,125
Do--do you have any reason to
think that Scott wouldn't be?
Nothing concrete,

226
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:28,375
but when he saw
that I was uncomfortable,

227
00:10:28,417 --> 00:10:32,041
he backed off fast,
and it felt practiced.
Well, he--I've heard
he's a good surgeon.

228
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,583
He seems like a good guy.
What, you've met him?

229
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,583
Oh, she had him to the house,
didn't she?

230
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:39,291
My god, she gives it up fast.
Cooper, y--

231
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:42,875
- what, what, am I wrong?
- He has not actually been to the house.

232
00:10:42,917 --> 00:10:45,166
He's just...
Picked her up there.

233
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,750
But I don't think
that they're--

234
00:10:47,792 --> 00:10:51,083
yeah, well, you're just
saying that to be nice.
But she is bringing him
to Maya's wedding.

235
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,041
He's her plus one.
I have the list.

236
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,417
I have all the lists--
caterers, deejays, florists.

237
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,375
I am knee-deep in wedding,

238
00:10:57,417 --> 00:11:00,458
and the sad part is, I have
never had one of my own.
That is sad, but back to me.

239
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,917
No one told me that plus one
was an option.

240
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,041
Cooper, the wedding
is in two days.

241
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:08,291
If you are thinking of
scaring up some random hoochie--
oh, no, I'm thinking about
inviting jordana Sampson.

242
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,375
Is she back in town?

243
00:11:10,417 --> 00:11:13,041
Mm-hmm.
Cooper, no.

244
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:16,041
She's not random
and she's not a hoochie.
I know, but she's--

245
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,083
exactly.

246
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,083
You didn't take that
personally, did you?

247
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,083
Is there a reason I should?
No, no.

248
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,041
Then I won't.
Me either.

249
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,583
It's
a professional disagreement.

250
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:28,166
Yes.

251
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:33,041
So... are you
still good with...

252
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,041
Yes. I think so.

253
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,625
I don't know.

254
00:11:36,667 --> 00:11:40,250
I told Sam this morning
that I was seeing someone.

255
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:43,041
I thought we weren't gonna--
no, we're not. It's just--

256
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,583
he came to my house last night.
I wasn't home.

257
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,583
I didn't want to lie to him.
You didn't tell him
it was me?

258
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,041
No, no.

259
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:53,041
You haven't told anyone,
have you, like Violet?

260
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:57,041
I... I wouldn't even know
what to say.

261
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:00,041
Because... this...

262
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,041
Mm-hmm.

263
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,291
With us...

264
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:04,500
Mm-hmm.

265
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:06,041
We're just...

266
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:09,041
Just getting through
what we're getting through.

267
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,375
Mm-hmm. We're just
helping each other...
Mm.

268
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:13,375
Helping each other feel good.

269
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:16,041
Really... really good.

270
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:20,750
Want to see
if that door locks?

271
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,041
Maya.
What are you doing here?

272
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,083
I want you
to come to my wedding.

273
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:36,417
Even though you're not proud
of me, I know you love me.

274
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,041
Of course I love you.

275
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:41,625
Do you think it would be better
if I didn't get married?
Yes.

276
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:45,041
I-I... I don't know.
It wouldn't.

277
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:49,083
I'm just trying to do
the right thing, but I need you.
You needed me
long before this,

278
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,625
but somehow, even though
I tried, I wasn't there for you.

279
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:53,625
And so for me to sit down

280
00:12:53,667 --> 00:12:55,625
in front of god
and everyone we know

281
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:57,500
for a formal, public reminder

282
00:12:57,542 --> 00:13:00,542
of how badly I screwed up
your life, i--
that's not
what my wedding is.

283
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,792
That's what
it would be to me.

284
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,750
The whole time we were
trying to get pregnant,

285
00:13:15,792 --> 00:13:18,458
Matthew kept telling me to
visualize what it would be like

286
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,458
when we were in the hospital,
when we were finally a family.
Yeah.

287
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,041
After a while,
I-I wanted to stop.

288
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,041
It's just too hard,
you know?

289
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,250
And it just felt like
it was never gonna happen.

290
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:31,041
But Matthew...
He kept promising it would.

291
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,125
He called the baby
"our dream deferred."

292
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:36,000
Oh, like the poem.

293
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,375
Langston Hughes.
Yeah.

294
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:39,542
We're English teachers.

295
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:45,166
Can i--can I hold him now?

296
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:48,417
Oh, we can't--
we can't take him out.

297
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:51,000
Even for a minute?
I'm sorry.

298
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,041
So how soon
can we do this surgery?

299
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,542
I told Matthew,

300
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,208
at the rate the baby's bowel
function is deteriorating,

301
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,917
you'd have to do
the operation today, right?

302
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:02,792
It's what they want
for their child,

303
00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:06,208
and I told them, if anybody
can help them here, it's you.

304
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,041
Dr. Montgomery...

305
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,208
Please.

306
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,375
I'll book an O.R.

307
00:14:15,417 --> 00:14:18,375
He was supposed to discharge ike
almost two hours ago.

308
00:14:18,417 --> 00:14:21,041
We kept paging him.
I'm really sorry.

309
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:24,041
I said Dr. Scott
was probably busy

310
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:27,041
sewing someone's brains
back in.
Well, there might have been
an emergency

311
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:30,041
where he was sewing
somebody's something back in.
Still--

312
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:33,375
no, i--he should not have left
you hanging. I'm really sorry.

313
00:14:33,417 --> 00:14:36,458
All right.
You're all set to go.
I hope that follow-up
is the only thing

314
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,583
that he's careless about.

315
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,417
I heard there was
a problem with your patient.

316
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:45,041
No. Actually, there's
a problem with your boyfriend.

317
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,834
He asked me for oxy
this morning, now he's M.I.A.

318
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:50,417
And you're assuming what?

319
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,875
He has a bad back.
Well, as his girlfriend,

320
00:14:52,917 --> 00:14:54,250
I'm sure
you're very sympathetic.

321
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:56,834
But as chief of staff
of the hospital where he works,

322
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,709
I think
you should be concerned

323
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,750
about how he's treating it...
If it's his back.

324
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:04,041
If you want to make
a formal complaint, do it.

325
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:07,166
That's what I thought.

326
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:12,834
Hey.

327
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,875
Hey.

328
00:15:14,917 --> 00:15:16,250
You working on the toast?

329
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:19,041
Trying.

330
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,041
Look, Sam,
about what I said--

331
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:24,041
we don't need to talk about it.
It's none of my business--
no, Sam--

332
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,041
Addison, please.
Not today, okay?

333
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:29,291
I-I c--i can barely
get through this.

334
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,709
What do you want to say?

335
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,750
I want to tell them stop,

336
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:35,750
you know,
and don't make this any worse.

337
00:15:35,792 --> 00:15:37,875
I just tried
to give that speech.

338
00:15:37,917 --> 00:15:40,542
A patient of Pete's
gave birth to a preemie--

339
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:44,542
25 weeks, just...
So many problems.

340
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:47,041
Best-case scenario,
it lives in the nicu

341
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:49,875
until I can't do
any more surgeries

342
00:15:49,917 --> 00:15:53,041
or give it any more drugs.
Are you and Pete in sync?

343
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,083
You said
it was Pete's patient, right?

344
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:57,041
Right. It is.

345
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:58,667
But we're not in sync.

346
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:00,750
I am a-about to go remove

347
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:02,667
most of the baby's
intestinal tract

348
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:04,959
because the parents
are hoping for a miracle,

349
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,542
and Pete doesn't want
to take that away from them,

350
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,542
and I couldn't say no.

351
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:12,542
So I gotta clear my schedule
and head back to the hospital.

352
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:16,041
Well, I get that--doing things
you don't want to do.

353
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,458
I'm supposed to make
this big speech

354
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,458
that makes everybody
feel good about the wedding...

355
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,792
Pretend like everything's okay.

356
00:16:23,834 --> 00:16:26,417
Sometimes
we have to pretend.

357
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,000
Eloping?

358
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:39,041
Oh. No, no. I'm just taking
the dress to get steamed.

359
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,041
It's--it's Maya's.

360
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,625
I figured.

361
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:45,834
Yeah. Well, you know,
it should be a pretty odd event.

362
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:49,417
You know, uh, Cooper's bringing
jordana Sampson.

363
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,125
She's back?

364
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:53,041
Oh, wow.
I know.

365
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,333
Y-You're not bringing
someone else are you,

366
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:57,041
a-a plus one?

367
00:16:57,083 --> 00:17:00,041
Uh, because among other things,
I'm the rsvp girl,

368
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,083
so, um, I'm just,
uh, making sure.

369
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,458
Nope. Just me. You?

370
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,000
Same.

371
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:10,000
I'll see you there.

372
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,667
Hey. You were supposed to
discharge ike Holden.

373
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:23,041
I had to come over here
just so they could go home.

374
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,041
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's my... my back.

375
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:27,041
It was killing me.

376
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,959
I-I laid down.
I guess I just went out.

377
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,458
Come on.
I know what you're thinking.

378
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,250
You think because I asked you
for a-a courtesy prescription,

379
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,291
what, you think now
i'm--I'm a drug addict

380
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,834
who crashed out here?
Tell me you haven't
taken anything.

381
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,667
I-I took one oxy.

382
00:17:41,709 --> 00:17:44,083
I don't have
any other surgeries scheduled.
Oh, that's the line?

383
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:46,041
As long as you're not
cutting someone open,

384
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,041
anything short of that,

385
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,375
it's okay that you
show up here like this?
Listen, I'm really sorry

386
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:53,000
that it bothers you that i'm
seeing your ex-girlfriend.
It bothers me

387
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:55,875
that you couldn't do your job
right now and you're still here.
I have never had
a single problem,

388
00:17:55,917 --> 00:17:59,375
in this hospital
or any other.
You want that to change?

389
00:17:59,417 --> 00:18:01,917
Are you threatening me?

390
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:07,041
I think you should go talk
to my colleague--Violet Turner.

391
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:09,667
She has a lot of experience
treating people with addiction--

392
00:18:09,709 --> 00:18:11,667
You want me to see a shrink?

393
00:18:11,709 --> 00:18:14,250
Convince her you don't have
a problem, I will lay off.

394
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:17,250
And if I don't?
We will let
this hospital sort it out.

395
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:18,875
You know,

396
00:18:18,917 --> 00:18:21,458
somehow I think Charlotte's
already decided about me.

397
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,041
Maybe, but I haven't.

398
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:30,917
How's it going?

399
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:35,041
Addison?

400
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,667
Addison?

401
00:18:36,709 --> 00:18:38,959
There are no clear margins.

402
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,291
The entire bowel
is involved?

403
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,959
There's nothing left
I can save.

404
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:47,959
Is there anything
you can do?

405
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,041
I can close him up.

406
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,667
But he survived
the surgery.
Yes, he survived, but--

407
00:18:58,709 --> 00:19:01,250
then there must be
something you can do.

408
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:04,000
Your baby doesn't have
a functioning digestive system.

409
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:06,041
So before
I could do anything,

410
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,041
I'd have to put
a central line in

411
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:11,333
through his stomach
to feed him.

412
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:14,083
And how long would he
have to have that?
Permanently.

413
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:17,041
And although I was able
to stop the cerebral bleed,

414
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,542
we have to assume
that there is

415
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:22,500
at least
moderate brain damage.
But you don't know that
for sure.

416
00:19:22,542 --> 00:19:25,041
No, I don't know that
for sure.

417
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,041
But it's more than likely
the case.

418
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,834
Just like the longer
we keep him on a respirator,

419
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,208
the more likely it is

420
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,041
that he'll have retinal failure
or that he'll go blind.

421
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:36,709
I'm not saying
there aren't miracles,

422
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,417
but at a certain point,
it's not fair to the baby--

423
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:43,000
to Langston--
to keep waiting for them.

424
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,375
What are the odds?

425
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:46,834
I want to know the odds.

426
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:51,542
Of a baby like Langston
living outside the nicu?

427
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:53,375
Less than 1%.

428
00:19:53,417 --> 00:19:56,125
But it could happen?

429
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,333
And it's our decision?

430
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:01,041
Uh, yeah, it is.

431
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:03,333
But he's in pain.

432
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,959
And with so little
to hope for, I'm sorry,

433
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I'm not comfortable
performing another surgery.

434
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:13,417
Are there other doctors
that we can get to help us?

435
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:16,583
Yes, you could find someone else
to put in a central line.

436
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,625
Then that's
what we'll do.

437
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,333
Will you please help us?

438
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,625
I'm sorry.

439
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:28,166
I understand if you want
to go a different way,

440
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:30,250
but I can't.

441
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:38,041
So are the--
are the drugs something new?

442
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,792
"The drugs".

443
00:20:39,834 --> 00:20:42,291
The drugs
are the occasional oxy

444
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:45,375
that I take
when my back flares up.

445
00:20:45,417 --> 00:20:48,709
You know what? Here you go.

446
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,375
Take 'em, toss 'em,
eat 'em.

447
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:52,875
Do whatever.

448
00:20:52,917 --> 00:20:55,709
That tell you
what you need to know?
Uh, well,

449
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,834
the fact that you are carrying
narcotics in your pocket

450
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:01,000
tells me that you may have
a more serious problem

451
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,625
than you're admitting.
It's funny how much you sound
like your buddy Cooper.

452
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:06,625
This has nothing to do
with him.
This has everything
to do with him.

453
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:08,500
He resents
my dating Charlotte.

454
00:21:08,542 --> 00:21:10,500
He can't seriously
call into question my judgment

455
00:21:10,542 --> 00:21:13,083
or my hand skills
or anything else that matters.

456
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:16,041
So he's trying to make me out
to be some kind of junkie,

457
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:19,041
and you're helping him.
I'm just asking questions,
trying to understand.

458
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,875
And I'm certainly
not forcing you to stay here.
No, Cooper is.

459
00:21:21,917 --> 00:21:24,875
You're free to leave.
I do that, he makes an issue
of it with Charlotte.

460
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:28,959
Does that worry you,
Charlotte knowing about this?
I'm not an addict!

461
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:39,959
Why are you so angry?

462
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,333
I don't know.

463
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:43,291
Well, maybe we can
keep talking,

464
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:46,041
find out
if there's something there.
I'm a good doctor.

465
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:48,917
Which is why you should also
stop seeing patients

466
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:52,291
until we get a handle on this,
whatever it is.
And how do I explain that,

467
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,959
to Charlotte,
to the doctors who refer me,

468
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,125
the patients
I already have scheduled?

469
00:21:57,166 --> 00:22:01,041
It will be easier than trying
to explain what happened

470
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:03,792
if you hurt someone.

471
00:22:05,834 --> 00:22:09,583
I can help you
if you want me to.

472
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,041
Okay.

473
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:21,000
Hey.

474
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:22,125
Hey.

475
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:25,041
I called you last night.
Oh, sorry.

476
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:28,291
No, no, no, I just was worried
about you after you walked out.

477
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:30,959
I'm okay.
Okay.

478
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,333
Well, for what it's worth,
I agree with you.

479
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:36,500
Enough is enough.

480
00:22:36,542 --> 00:22:39,041
Yeah.

481
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:41,333
Addison--
No. No, no.

482
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:44,375
- What?
- Not in my office.

483
00:22:44,417 --> 00:22:48,125
I was just trying
to be a friend.
Well, just, you know,
be a friend from there.

484
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:49,792
Will this help?

485
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:55,041
Hey, Sam,
you got a minute?

486
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,583
I wanted to talk to you
about the wedding.

487
00:22:57,625 --> 00:23:00,041
Uh, talk to Violet.
No, no,
it's not a Violet thing.

488
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:02,041
Not now.
No, now, Sam.

489
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:05,041
Look, I-I get that this
is hard for you, okay?

490
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:07,041
But it doesn't change the fact

491
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:09,208
that Maya's
gonna get married tomorrow,

492
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,834
and you signed the paper
so that she could,

493
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:14,834
and now you're making her
feel like crap about it.
I will be there at the wedding.
I will walk her down the aisle.

494
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:17,041
Okay, but showing up
and acting like this?

495
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:19,166
I mean, it's no better
than what Naomi's doing.

496
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:21,583
And someone has to be there
for her, to be happy for her,

497
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:25,208
to--to support her, and if
it's not either of you--
I'm trying.

498
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,250
Try harder.

499
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:33,291
Oh, hey.
Where you going?

500
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:36,417
I am going to pick up
Maya and dink's wedding rings.

501
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,417
It's just another thing
that I can check off

502
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:42,166
this list of errands I never
thought I would do for anybody.

503
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:43,792
Hey, uh, before you go...

504
00:23:43,834 --> 00:23:46,041
So should I be worried
about Scott or...

505
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:49,625
If I thought he was dangerous,
I would report him.

506
00:23:49,667 --> 00:23:51,792
That's all I'm gonna say.

507
00:23:54,792 --> 00:23:56,125
What?

508
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:58,041
Were you talking about me?

509
00:23:58,083 --> 00:23:59,125
No.
No.

510
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:01,041
You were talking about Scott.

511
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:03,333
Look, I am not gonna say
anything to either one of you.
And you shouldn't.

512
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,709
Unless of course you care
about the health and safety

513
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,083
of any of the patients
he might treat at the hospital

514
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:11,542
where he works,
cutting them open.
Which, roughly translated, means
"please, violate privilege

515
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:14,959
to give me some dirt
on my ex's new man."
I-I don't care
about you and him.

516
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,542
I do care that he's

517
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:18,959
probably smart enough not to
trigger Violet's duty to report,

518
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,375
which means he's gonna
have to hurt someone

519
00:24:21,417 --> 00:24:24,959
before anyone
takes action here.
I'm--I'm not getting
in the middle of this.

520
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,750
You know who needs
therapy here? You.

521
00:24:27,792 --> 00:24:30,125
Cooper Freedman.

522
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:32,125
Yeah, ike Holden
is my patient.

523
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:34,375
What happened?

524
00:24:34,417 --> 00:24:37,291
And who's doing
the surgery?

525
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:46,333
Sam.

526
00:24:49,625 --> 00:24:51,417
How's Maya doing?

527
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:54,041
How do you think
she's doing?

528
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:55,709
She's getting married
tomorrow,

529
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:58,041
and you're
not gonna be there.

530
00:24:58,083 --> 00:25:00,583
Where are you gonna be?

531
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:02,417
I'm going to...

532
00:25:02,458 --> 00:25:05,041
I'm going to napa...

533
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:07,041
With William.

534
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:09,417
Wow.
I don't expect you
to understand--

535
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:11,041
of course I understand.

536
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:13,417
You think I don't want
to do the same thing,

537
00:25:13,458 --> 00:25:16,083
just run away
from all this?

538
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:19,625
But I can't, because someone
has to be the adult here.

539
00:25:19,667 --> 00:25:21,625
And you left that to me.

540
00:25:21,667 --> 00:25:24,041
I didn't mean for this
to be like this, Sam.
Just like
you're not gonna mean

541
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:26,792
for Maya to start going
to Corinne with her problems

542
00:25:26,834 --> 00:25:28,166
or for Corinne to be

543
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:30,041
the one she wants around
when the baby comes,

544
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:32,250
and then in a little while
for Corinne to be the one

545
00:25:32,291 --> 00:25:34,375
she starts seeing
as her family.

546
00:25:34,417 --> 00:25:37,041
Because if you keep doing
what you're doing,

547
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:39,041
that's what's gonna happen.

548
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:43,583
So grow up. Do your job.
Be a mother.

549
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:56,458
Now what?

550
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,500
Tell me you are not
doing this surgery.

551
00:25:58,542 --> 00:26:00,250
Ike has significant ischemia.

552
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:02,166
If I don't restore
the blood supply, he could die.

553
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:04,917
Now I don't know what he's
told you, but this happens

554
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:06,709
in a small percentage
of hernia repairs.

555
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:09,917
I didn't do anything wrong.
You don't have to explain
the medicine to me.

556

Just tell me if you've
taken anything today.
You're kidding.

your ex-boyfriend has issues?

for a minute...

651
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:01,667

653
00:31:03,291 --> 00:31:04,875

654
00:31:04,917 --> 00:31:06,542
I mean, he could...

655
00:31:06,583 --> 00:31:08,333
He could get better.

656
00:31:08,375 --> 00:31:10,125
You're hurting him,

657
00:31:10,166 --> 00:31:12,125
and your job as a parent

658
00:31:12,166 --> 00:31:15,000
is to make sure
that nothing hurts him.

659
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:26,417
I love him.

660
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:30,000

your something new...

678
00:32:44,166 --> 00:32:46,792
I bought it
for your 16th birthday.

679
00:32:46,834 --> 00:32:49,750
I always wanted one
when I was a girl, so...

680
00:32:49,792 --> 00:32:53,041
"M.b." Maya Bennett.

681
00:32:53,083 --> 00:32:55,125
I hope
you'll keep the name...

682
00:32:55,166 --> 00:32:58,750

Seeing Maya
in this wedding dress,

724
00:38:03,709 --> 00:38:08,083
I'm struck by what a beautiful
and elegant young woman

725
00:38:08,125 --> 00:38:11,041
she has grown up to become.

726
00:38:11,083 --> 00:38:13,750
And I know
that moving forward,

727
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:16,709
this image of her
will stay with me,

728
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:19,458
the same
as another image of Maya

729
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,750
in a different
pretty white dress

730
00:38:21,792 --> 00:38:23,750
has stayed with me as well.

731
00:38:23,792 --> 00:38:26,542
The dress I'm talking about
was white,

732
00:38:26,583 --> 00:38:31,542
but it had red and blue
abc's all across the front.

733
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:34,458
I, uh, I remember,

734
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,458
I came home one evening

735
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,542
after a-a marathon
of kids' parties and whatnot,

736
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:42,083
and little miss Maya
was not quite ready

737
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:45,083
to take her little dress off
and get in the bath.

738
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:48,125
So we went to her room
and hung out on her floor,

739
00:38:48,166 --> 00:38:49,750
started talking.

740
00:38:49,792 --> 00:38:53,041
And out of nowhere, she told me
that when she grew up,

741
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:55,041
she wanted to marry me.

742
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:57,208
So, uh, I said, "why?"

743
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:59,208
I asked her, I said, "why me?"

744
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:01,875
And she looked up at me,

745
00:39:01,917 --> 00:39:03,750
and she said, "because, daddy,

746
00:39:03,792 --> 00:39:07,041
you are my anyway friend."

747
00:39:09,792 --> 00:39:12,750
Now at the time,
I didn't know what that meant.

748
00:39:12,792 --> 00:39:15,083
So Maya had to explain to me

749
00:39:15,125 --> 00:39:17,709
that an anyway friend

750
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,709
is the one person in your life

751
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:22,750
who, no matter what
they say or do,

752
00:39:22,792 --> 00:39:25,583
no matter what they've
been through with you,

753
00:39:25,625 --> 00:39:28,667
they love you anyway.

754
00:39:28,709 --> 00:39:33,750
So my sincerest hope
is that for Maya, dink,

755
00:39:33,792 --> 00:39:38,041
and for dink, Maya,
is that anyway friend.

756
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:40,041
Because no matter
how old you are

757
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:42,250
