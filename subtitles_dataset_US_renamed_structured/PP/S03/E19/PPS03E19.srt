00:00:03,291 --> 00:00:05,083
♪ Ohhh ohhh ohhh ♪

2
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:10,834
I'm here. I'm here.
You paged me.

3
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:14,375
Why do you have that baby
in my hospital?
It's Lucas. Pete's son.

4
00:00:14,417 --> 00:00:16,792
He had a child, remember?
You were there.

5
00:00:16,834 --> 00:00:20,542
Why do you have
that baby in my hospital?
Pete is taking over for Nai
while she is out of town.

6
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:23,542
You paged 9-1-1.
I was looking after Lucas.
Why do you have--

7
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:25,792
the nanny is meeting me here
any minute.

8
00:00:25,834 --> 00:00:28,542
Now come on. What is up?
Kayla Lindy,
the coma mama--

9
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:31,166
her husband's bringing in
the big guns.
Which big guns?

10
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:33,125
Dr. Geraldine Ginsberg.

11
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,667
Ahh.
He's flying in Ginsberg?

12
00:00:35,709 --> 00:00:38,542
He wants her to wake his wife
up from the coma.

13
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:41,333
You gonna keep playing mommy
or you gonna get in there?

14
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,333
- Okay. Here.
- Take the baby.

15
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:45,041
Take the baby, Charlotte.

16
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:47,125
Take the baby. Okay?

17
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:50,125
Yeah. The nanny will be here
in about ten minutes, okay?

18
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:52,625
Here you go.
Take it. Mm.

19
00:00:52,667 --> 00:00:55,667
Ooh. Be good.

20
00:00:55,709 --> 00:00:58,166
Hello.

21
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:00,875
I'm Charlotte.

22
00:01:00,917 --> 00:01:03,083
Please don't drool
on me.

23
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:05,875
And then drew got
a triple, slid into third

24
00:01:05,917 --> 00:01:08,875
and scraped the hell out of
his ankle, but you know drew.

25
00:01:08,917 --> 00:01:12,834
He didn't care. You'd have been
really proud of him. Hey.

26
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:16,041
So... Dr. Montgomery's here.

27
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:19,250
And Dr. Ginsberg will be here
any minute now.

28
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,792
I know you think
she can't hear me,

29
00:01:25,834 --> 00:01:27,834
but, uh...
Maybe she can.

30
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:30,834
A-And when Dr. Ginsberg
gets here and wakes her up,

31
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:32,834
I just want her to know
that...

32
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:34,959
I didn't give up on her.

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,875
Eddie,
I need to talk to you.

34
00:01:37,917 --> 00:01:40,083
Dr. Ginsberg is an extremely
accomplished neurosurgeon,

35
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:42,291
but Kayla has been...

36
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:44,291
She's been in a coma
for six weeks.

37
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:46,834
I just don't want you
to get your hopes up.

38
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:49,125
Did you know
Ginsberg revived a patient

39
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:51,834
who was comatose for 17 years?
I'll get my miracle.

40
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:55,125
We'll get our miracle.
I mean, she's gonna wake up.

41
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:57,834
I don't know why
you have to be so negative.
Eddie--

42
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:00,000
why can't you just believe?

43
00:02:01,917 --> 00:02:04,166
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:06,959
It's just, uh...

45
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:11,333
I unplugged
the love of my life,

46
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:13,041
and she didn't die.

47
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:15,542
She didn't die.

48
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:18,000
That's gotta mean something,
you know? And...

49
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:21,083
I'm Dr. Ginsberg.
This is my team.

50
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:22,917
Which one are you?
Oh. Hello.

51
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,458
Dr. Montgomery or Dr. King?
Dr. Montgomery.
Pleasure to meet you.

52
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,041
And this is Eddie Lindy,
Kayla's husband.

53
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:31,041
Thank you so much
for coming all this way.
I prefer that family members
wait outside

54
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,542
during the diagnostic process.

55
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,834
Dr. Ginsberg--
no, no, it's, uh,
that's fine.

56
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:37,208
Whatever it takes.

57
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,709
Okay, uh, patient is
Kayla Lindy, 32 years of age,

58
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,041
surrogate mother
pregnant with triplets.

59
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:44,583
During the pregnancy,

60
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,083
complications led to
a pulmonary--

61
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,917
I'm familiar with the file.

62
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,083
All right.

63
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:52,542
I'm gonna need a complete exam
along with a repeat e.E.G.,

64
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:55,083
an m.R.I. And a cerebral
blood flow study.

65
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,333
Come on. Go, people. Go.

66
00:02:57,375 --> 00:03:01,000
Oh, so nice of you
to join us, Dr. Shepherd.

67
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:03,000
I assume you didn't plan
on making a decision

68
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,417
without reviewing
the radionuclide cisternogram.

69
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:07,208
Amy?

70
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:11,041
Hey... Addie.

71
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,834
So long time no see.

72
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:15,000
You two know each other?

73
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:19,000
Yes. Uh, yes. I...
I was married to her brother.

74
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:20,208
Ah.

75
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,583
Don't worry.

76
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:32,041
Ginsberg is a beast,
but she's also a genius.

77
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,458
Amy, why didn't you tell me
you were coming?

78
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,458
What,
and spoil the surprise?

79
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,458
You knew I was here?
Your name is all over
Kayla's records.

80
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,792
Amy--

81
00:03:40,834 --> 00:03:42,041
uh, Amelia.

82
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:46,041
Derek is the only one
who calls me Amy these days.

83
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,041
Amelia...
But Derek didn't tell me

84
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,083
that you were
one of Ginsberg's fellows.

85
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,417
Shocker.

86
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,417
Did he, uh,
did he even tell you

87
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,417
that I went
into neurosurgery?

88
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,875
Is that
the Geraldine Ginsberg?

89
00:03:57,917 --> 00:03:59,917
My god.

90
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:02,625
Sam Bennett.
You stayed hot.

91
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:04,041
Amelia Shepherd?

92
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:07,041
Well, the last time I saw you,
you were, like, 14 years old.

93
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,667
What happened?
Now she is
a fancy neurosurgeon.

94
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:13,417
Oh! There you are.
Take your kid.
Oh.

95
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:15,458
Nanny was a no-show.
Oh, what is it?

96
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,542
I have to get to the office.
He spit up on me.

97
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:20,083
Oh.
I'm sending you
a dry cleaning bill.

98
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,083
Okay, apparently there are
a lot of things

99
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:25,875
that Derek does not say.
Oh, no, no, no.
He's--he's not mine.

100
00:04:25,917 --> 00:04:28,083
He's, uh,
he's my boyfriend's son.

101
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,542
Dr. Shepherd.

102
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,750
Uh, duty calls.
We will talk later.

103
00:04:31,792 --> 00:04:33,500
I missed you guys.

104
00:04:33,542 --> 00:04:35,333
See you later.

105
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,041
Hurricane Amelia
made good.

106
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:40,041
What kind of family is it

107
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,542
where the black sheep
ends up being a neurosurgeon?

108
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,083
Wow.

109
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:46,083
Huh? Oh, what? Huh?
How you doing, buddy?

110
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,125
Are you gonna be
a doctor, too?

111
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:50,125
Is that what you're
talking about? Huh?

112
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:53,125
Yeah, that's Sam.
That's Sam. I think you are.
You're so good with him.

113
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:56,125
Thank you. Listen, I gotta
get him back to the nanny.

114
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:59,125
Can you, um, tell Ginsberg
I'll be right back?
Mm-hmm. Yeah. All right.

115
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,125
Say bye-bye. Say bye-bye.

116
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:02,583
See you later, buddy?

117
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:05,000
Bye. Say bye-bye. Bye.
Okay.

118
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:14,667
If she can help her...

119
00:05:14,709 --> 00:05:16,667
I know it's asking a lot.

120
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:20,291
But... anything's possible,
right?

121
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,333
Wait. You know
this isn't your fault?

122
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,375
Look. Hey, look at me.

123
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:28,834
Look at me.

124
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:31,000
This is not your fault.

125
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:36,333
It is.

126
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:39,166
But thank you
for saying it isn't.

127
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:50,333
Oh, Charlotte. Good.
I'm glad you're here.

128
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,333
I-I can't do
the sex ed seminar

129
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:55,125
at the retirement home
tonight.
You are not bailing on me?

130
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,125
Uh, well, not by choice.

131
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:59,333
I have a patient.
We're doing an intervention.

132
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:03,041
It's a thing.
You know, I'm sorry.
Great. What am I supposed to do
about the male point of view?

133
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:05,041
Well, actually,
I have a pitch for that.

134
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,417
You know, uh,
what about Cooper?

135
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,166
No.

136
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,208
He's great with people.

137
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,208
He's great
with 5 year olds.
Come on, Charlotte.

138
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,208
You've been sitting on
your hands for a month now.

139
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,208
How do you expect
to win him back

140
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,208
if you don't just
reach out there?
Who said I wanted
to win him back?

141
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,125
You are never gonna have
what you really want

142
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:29,166
if you don't put yourself
out there and go for it.

143
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,709
You really do
give crappy advice.

144
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:35,333
No, actually,
I'm kinda... brilliant.

145
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:43,041
Application
for the fda approval

146
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:45,041
for the next stage
of my a.L.S. Study.

147
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:47,709
Naomi usually reviews the data
before we submit it,

148
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,041
but with her gone
and leaving you in charge,

149
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,834
it's your job now.

150
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:54,208
Oh, thanks.
Looks like a fun read.

151
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,208
Being in charge
is not my idea of fun.

152
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,000
I mean, I'm glad

153
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,041
that William finally told her
about his a.L.S.,

154
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,875
but I didn't know

155
00:07:01,917 --> 00:07:04,542
she was gonna run off
to Switzerland to be with him.

156
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,667
Any word from them?

157
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:08,667
I heard from Naomi
a few days ago.

158
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:11,125
I guess he hasn't seen
any improvement.

159
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:14,125
Did Naomi say when, uh,
they're planning on coming back?
No.

160
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:17,125
Then move that
to the top of the pile

161
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,125
so they have a reason to.

162
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,041
Come on, Charlotte.
Sex ed for seniors?

163
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:28,667
It's a little out of
my wheelhouse, don't you think?

164
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:31,542
Actually, they're not all that
different from horny teenagers.

165
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,959
They got too much time
on their hands,

166
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
minimal supervision,
almost zero regard

167
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,542
for the consequences
of reckless sexual behavior.

168
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,667
Grannies gone wild.
It's a real problem, Cooper.

169
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:44,583
S.t.d.s are spreading through
the elder care community

170
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,125
like a brush fire.

171
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,583
The women can't get pregnant.

172
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:50,333
The men are all hopped up
on p.D.E.5 inhibitors.

173
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:52,041
Everybody's
screwing everybody else.

174
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,542
Nobody's taking
any precautions.

175
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:56,875
As much fun as that sounds,
it's old people, Charlotte.

176
00:07:56,917 --> 00:07:58,792
I'm a pediatrician.

177
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,000
I need a man.

178
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,917
A male.

179
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,041
Oh.

180
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,291
The male residents
are often uncomfortable

181
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:14,291
broaching sexual matters
with female medical staff.
Why me?

182
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,959
I'm coming to you
as a physician,

183
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,959
a fellow partner
of this medical practice.

184
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,542
Put away your fear
of age spots. Help me out.

185
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:29,000
Kayla's repeat e.E.G.
Shows diffuse slowing

186
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:32,000
consistent with
a permanent vegetative state.

187
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,333
Surgery won't help.

188
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:36,041
Kayla is not
a viable candidate.

189
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,333
I'm sorry, Eddie.

190
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:40,333
There must--must be something
else you can at least try.

191
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:42,333
She can't just...
Stay like this.

192
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,542
I'm afraid I can't help.

193
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:48,834
What about cannulating
the aqueduct of sylvius?

194
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:52,875
Passing a stent
to drain the fluid buildup?
Dr. Shepherd.

195
00:08:52,917 --> 00:08:54,875
Her c.S.F. Studies show
a slowing of flow,

196
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:56,959
not a complete obstruction.
It could work.

197
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,583
You know how to wake her?
No, she doesn't.

198
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:01,208
She's referring to
an experimental procedure

199
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,208
that has shown
very little success,

200
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,375
and in your wife's case,
it will not work.
I assisted
in two of the procedures...

201
00:09:05,417 --> 00:09:08,125
Now is not the time
to bring it up.
So do it or don't, but don't
say that it can't work.

202
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:11,000
Amelia--
this procedure
is a bad idea.

203
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,792
If she thinks that
it can work, then we sh--
she is a teaching fellow who is
not qualified to make this call.

204
00:09:12,834 --> 00:09:14,792
I graduated top of my class
at Harvard.

205
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:17,041
I did my residency
at Johns Hopkins.

206
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:20,041
I have done dozens of procedures
in the third ventricle.

207
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:26,417
I am more than qualified.
That's why you hired me.
Well, clearly I made a mistake.
You're fired, Dr. Shepherd.

208
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,625
And it goes without saying

209
00:09:32,667 --> 00:09:35,709
that just because the risk
of pregnancy is gone,

210
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,208
the risk of contracting sexually
transmitted diseases isn't.

211
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,208
In fact,
in a place of this size,

212
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,583
where many of you are so...

213
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:51,041
So lucky to be enjoying
considerable leisure time...

214
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,417
Uh, e-exactly.

215
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:53,667
Yeah.

216
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:55,333
In a situation like this,

217
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,917
transmission rates can be
very high, which is why,

218
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:00,041
if you're
going to have intercourse,

219
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:03,041
we'd like to urge you to
flash back to high school

220
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,291
and start
using condoms again.

221
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,667
Alternatively, um...

222
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:16,083
There--there are many ways
to be intimate and safe

223
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:19,041
short of--
of actual penetration.

224
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,500
Can anyone name a way
to get pleasure

225
00:10:21,542 --> 00:10:23,667
without penetration?

226
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:34,000
I just feel so awful
for the husband.

227
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:36,000
You know,
he's--he's gonna have to

228
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:38,750
watch her wither away
hooked up to a feeding tube

229
00:10:38,792 --> 00:10:40,792
when it doesn't
have to be that way.

230
00:10:40,834 --> 00:10:44,125
It's a crime. I mean, it's
a crime of medical omission.

231
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,458
In fairness, even Derek said
that this isn't doable.

232
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,458
I e-mailed the scans,
and he said it's a no go.
Derek is just like Ginsberg.

233
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,333
I mean, if he hasn't seen it,
it ain't so. This is just new.

234
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,792
This is a cutting-edge
surgical procedure.

235
00:10:55,834 --> 00:10:57,959
The university of Wisconsin
did a study

236
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,041
on a series of 11 patients.

237
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,959
I've seen it.
I mean, I could do it.

238
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:08,041
I'm just saying...
I trained for it.

239
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,500
You do realize

240
00:11:09,542 --> 00:11:12,333
we're talking about a woman
with three babies inside her?

241
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:15,041
And you realize that Kayla has
a husband and two children?

242
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,041
Addie, what do you think?

243
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,750
I th--

244
00:11:18,792 --> 00:11:21,041
Oh. Could we pause
for a moment, please.

245
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,041
Here. I'll get it.
I'll get him.
Yeah?

246
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,375
Yeah.

247
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:33,333
I should get outta here
and go pick up Vanessa.

248
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,834
Vanessa?

249
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,583
His girlfriend.

250
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,041
Yeah.
Thank you.

251
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,625
Uh, all right.
I'll see you guys later.

252
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,500
See you.
Have fun. Have fun.

253
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,792
Okay, so you and Sam...

254
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,583
What is with the tension?

255
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,750
There's no tension.
I was sitting right here.

256
00:11:53,792 --> 00:11:57,000
I mean,
you barely looked at him.

257
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,000
There was a thing.

258
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,458
With you and Sam?
With me and Sam.

259
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,458
And Naomi did not
take it well.

260
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,458
And now I'm with Pete, and Sam
is with Vanessa, and it's fine.

261
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,041
It's very adult.
Sounds very messy.

262
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,458
No, it's not, actually.
It's great.

263
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,500
My life is working.

264
00:12:17,542 --> 00:12:19,000
Addison.

265
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,208
I mean, this is me
you're talking to.

266
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,917
I caught you with
my brother's best friend

267
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:27,667
and I kept your secret.

268
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:29,667
I mean, you can talk to me.

269
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:33,000
You used to trust me.

270
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,667
I chose Pete.

271
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:37,041
I choose Pete.
He's great. We're great.

272
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:40,041
And... I can't have kids,

273
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,500
and Pete has Lucas.

274
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:44,709
So that's sort of this...

275
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,709
Amazing icing on the cake.

276
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,250
Except for the fact that...

277
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,500
Pete's still in love
with Lucas' mother,

278
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:53,041
which is...

279
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:57,041
Oh, Addie.

280
00:12:57,083 --> 00:13:00,208
So anyway... cheers.

281
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,250
I missed you.

282
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,750
You know, you were always
a better sister

283
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:13,375
than the ones I had.

284
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:16,458
And you were way better
than my brother.

285
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,750
Are things okay
between you two?

286
00:13:18,792 --> 00:13:22,166
He's the golden child.

287
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,500
Everything's always okay
with him.

288
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,959
That was painful.

289
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,959
At least they took
some condoms.

290
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Ah, do you have any questions
or--or want some more condoms?

291
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:37,959
Actually,
I do have a question

292
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,333
for the gentleman,
if that's all right.

293
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,041
The gentleman.

294
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,125
Of course.

295
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,208
I'll be waiting.

296
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,000
Hello.

297
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:59,041
How c--how can I... help?

298
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,333
I don't really know
how to say this.

299
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,333
Uh, it's somewhat
embarrassing.

300
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,625
No, i'm--i'm--I'm a doctor.
I've heard it all.

301
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:08,041
Come...

302
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,125
Okay.

303
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:12,750
Well... Nora and I...

304
00:14:12,792 --> 00:14:15,083
We've been dating
for several months.

305
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:18,458
She's a really lovely woman,
really lovely.

306
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,041
And our, uh, our intimate time
has been very good

307
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:25,041
except lately, it's been
difficult for me to--

308
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,041
oh, you know,
as men get older,

309
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:30,041
it's, uh, it's very common
for them to have difficulty,

310
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:33,041
as you say, getting, um...
Trying to--

311
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,041
no, it's not that.
Oh.

312
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,375
I'm still able to perform.
Oh, good. Good, good, good.

313
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:40,375
It's just become uncomfortable.
My pelvis is sore.

314
00:14:40,417 --> 00:14:43,000
It doesn't want to move
the way it used to.

315
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:46,000
So I don't find myself
getting, uh, in the mood.

316
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:47,041
Oh.

317
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:50,041
So... I was hoping
you would have some pills

318
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,917
to help with libido.

319
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:53,166
Given your discomfort,

320
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,166
I think you should have
a complete exam

321
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:57,291
before we prescribe anything.

322
00:14:57,333 --> 00:15:00,500
And you can do that? I could
make an appointment with you,

323
00:15:00,542 --> 00:15:03,083
and you could check me out?
It's--it's my associate's
specialty not mine.

324
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:06,166
But I can bring her up to speed
on everything we talked about.

325
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,917
But you really--

326
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:10,917
you really should make
an ap-appointment to see her.

327
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,041
With a lady?

328
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,083
She's no lady.

329
00:15:20,542 --> 00:15:23,709
Y'all kept me up till
3:00 this morning.

330
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,709
Oh, oh, god. I'm sorry.
No, I'm just kidding.

331
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,709
Sorry, Sam.
I'm glad she's here.

332
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,208
I--me, too. It's nice.

333
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:34,041
I forgot... how much I like
having someone to talk to.

334
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,834
You can talk to me.

335
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,083
No, I can't.

336
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,041
It--

337
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,959
Sam, I can't.

338
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,458
I know. Oh, boy.

339
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,750
Amelia?

340
00:15:50,792 --> 00:15:54,041
Uh, Eddie wanted to hear
more about the surgery.

341
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:57,041
So we started talking,
and one thing led to another,

342
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,125
and, uh...

343
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,750
And what?

344
00:16:01,792 --> 00:16:04,125
And he asked me
to do the surgery.

345
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,041
And I said yes.

346
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,709
I can do the surgery
and save the babies.

347
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,333
I just need you in there
to keep an eye on them

348
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,583
and Sam to maintain
the cardiovascular function.

349
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,041
This can work.
It's reckless.

350
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,041
How--well, how--
how would this work?

351
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:25,333
Just for Eddie's sake, I want
to know how this would work.

352
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,333
Mm-hmm. I would relieve
the obstruction

353
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,041
by placing a stent
in the aqueduct,

354
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,041
and then
as the pressure drops,

355
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,291
the activity in the brain stem
will return,

356
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:36,041
and Kayla wakes up.
And if it works,
what state will she be in?

357
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,041
Will she
be able to function?

358
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:41,041
I don't know. But if we don't
do it, we will never know.

359
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,959
I'm against this.
I am, too.

360
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,959
Two neurosurgeons said no
to this, one being your mentor,

361
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,709
the other being your brother.
Derek looked at an e-mail
of a scan.

362
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,709
I mean, he--he didn't even
see the patient,

363
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,208
which ultimately
doesn't matter,

364
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,834
because Eddie Lindy made
a decision to save his wife.

365
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:58,500
He asked me to do it,
and I can do it.

366
00:16:58,542 --> 00:17:00,625
Now will you give me
privileges here?

367
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,417
Yes.

368
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,792
Great.

369
00:17:05,834 --> 00:17:07,875
I'll get you an O.R.
for tomorrow.

370
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:13,000
Addison, what are you
going to do to stop her?

371
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,208
Nothing.
Look, I was wrong.
I made a bad call.

372
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:18,208
Yeah, well...
I admit that. But we're both
on the same side with this.

373
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,208
We both want to give
those babies a chance.
What, do you really think
I can talk her out of it?

374
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,208
I couldn't talk you out of it.
I think you could try. I think
you could try talking to her.

375
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,208
Eddie wants this,
Amelia is set,

376
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,208
and she just got sanctioned
by the chief of staff.

377
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,583
You know her. You know
this is wrong. So stop her.

378
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,041
Have you reviewed
the application?

379
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,875
Not yet.
Overnight it to Naomi.

380
00:17:38,917 --> 00:17:41,041
Really? You don't think
she has enough on her plate?

381
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:44,083
Why are you
rolling around here

382
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:46,041
with this gigantic chip
on your shoulder?

383
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,041
You should've never told me
about William's a.L.S.

384
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,458
You know, I-I get it.

385
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,917
You're upset that your study
isn't going fast enough.

386
00:17:51,959 --> 00:17:54,709
I'll read the application,
I'll get--

387
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,834
this isn't about
the damn application.

388
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,041
I slept with Naomi.

389
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:03,834
And... then I told her
about William.

390
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,041
Y--

391
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,500
yeah, yeah.

392
00:18:06,542 --> 00:18:08,041
You told Naomi...

393
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:11,041
That William has a.L.S.?

394
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:14,083
Why?

395
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:16,500
I don't know.

396
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:18,959
I wanted more from her,

397
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,959
and I thought it was
the right thing to do

398
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,500
or that she'd be pissed at him
for withholding.

399
00:18:24,542 --> 00:18:26,875
I don't know.

400
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:28,917
Doesn't matter.

401
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:30,458
She's gone.

402
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:40,041
Prostate cancer?

403
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:44,041
I came in for loss of libido,
pain from arthritis.

404
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:46,041
Discovery
of prostate cancer

405
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,041
is often
an incidental finding.

406
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:50,041
You don't find it
if you don't look,

407
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,041
and then it's too late.

408
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,125
What is the treatment?

409
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:57,041
In your case, I recommend
radiation therapy--

410
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:58,583
either external

411
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:01,875
or with an implantable
radioactive seed.

412
00:19:01,917 --> 00:19:05,041
What about...

413
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:07,083
What about my Johnson?

414
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,500
Will it still work after?

415
00:19:09,542 --> 00:19:11,500
About half of all patients

416
00:19:11,542 --> 00:19:13,542
do experience
erectile difficulty

417
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:17,125
following radiation.
And there are no
alternative treatments?

418
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,583
Well, given your circumstances,
not that I recommend.

419
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,125
But there are things we can do
if impotence occurs

420
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,959
as a side effect
of the radiation--

421
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,166
injections, pumps--

422
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:29,125
if I don't have
the treatment...

423
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,166
How long do I have?

424
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:36,000
Four, maybe five years.

425
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,417
It's been lovely
talking to you.

426
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,041
Thank you for your time.

427
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:49,083
Mr. Schmitt.

428
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,667
He's a man,

429
00:19:50,709 --> 00:19:52,041
and you're talking about him
losing his manhood.
I get that.

430
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:54,166
No, you can't. You're a woman.
You couldn't possibly know

431
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,166
how something like that
would make him feel.

432
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,625
And you're a man,
so of course you do.

433
00:19:58,667 --> 00:20:00,166
Yes, that's right.

434
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:03,166
I mean, is the guy
even making the wrong decision?

435
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,166
Prostate cancer's
pretty slow growing. He's 80.

436
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:08,125
If he wants to live the life
he has left on his own terms

437
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,125
and not have to talk to you
about sex,

438
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:12,583
who are we to tell him no?
So I should just let him die?

439
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:15,625
Oh, come on.
That's not what I'm saying.
He's in
extraordinarily good health.

440
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:18,041
And this cancer's aggressive.
His gleason level's a 7.

441
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:21,041
And if he's made it to 80,

442
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,667
statistically, he's got a good
shot of making it to 100.

443
00:20:23,709 --> 00:20:25,709
Now he's got a woman
that he loves--

444
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,709
that he wants to be able
to love.

445
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,709
He doesn't want to be
emasculated, Charlotte.

446
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,041
Is it so hard for you
to see that?

447
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:35,166
Are we talking about Oscar
or we talking about you?

448
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:37,000
Excuse me?

449
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,250
Emasculation seems to be
your catch phrase for me.

450
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:41,250
I wasn't talking about you,
but truth?

451
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:43,709
Yeah, you like to be tougher
than everyone else,

452
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,917
and that makes
some people pull away.
I thought we were past this.

453
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:48,709
You brought it up.

454
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,000
I came to you for help.

455
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:54,750
Well, maybe that wasn't
such a good idea.
Clearly.

456
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:01,917
Dr. Shepherd.

457
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:05,041
Uh, this is
Angie and Simon McConnell.

458
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,125
They're the parents that
Kayla's surrogate for.

459
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,041
They wanted to meet you.

460
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:12,041
Well, i'd--I'd shake
your hands, but...

461
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,875
Dr. Montgomery told us
what's happening.

462
00:21:14,917 --> 00:21:16,875
Eddie doesn't want
to hear this,

463
00:21:16,917 --> 00:21:20,041
but our babies
are barely viable.

464
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,417
He's well aware.
We know
this is horrible to ask

465
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:25,917
after all that Kayla's
been through, but...

466
00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:28,500
Please don't do this.

467
00:21:28,542 --> 00:21:31,500
We are so close
to having our family.

468
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:36,000
Would you talk with me
outside for a minute?

469
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,375
You thought if I saw the parents
with their sad faces,

470
00:21:44,417 --> 00:21:45,959
what, I was just
gonna back down?

471
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,542
Look,
I'm doing the right thing.

472
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,542
Not for the babies.
The risk is too high.

473
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,542
The Addison Montgomery I know
would Wade through fire

474
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:52,333
for a patient.

475
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:54,333
She wouldn't whine about
the risks.

476
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:55,583
I mean, she'd go
all super woman on me

477
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,333
trying to convince me
to do the surgery.

478
00:21:57,375 --> 00:22:00,041
What is it? What, you're
settling in your personal life,

479
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:03,041
so now you're willing to settle
with your patients, too?
I am not settling, Amelia.

480
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:04,959
You have feelings
for someone else.

481
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,041
Pete has feelings
for his kid's mom.

482
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:10,041
You say it's great.
You don't seem great.
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

483
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:15,083
You seem sad, Addison.
And you should be.

484
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,166
Okay, what--you are way
out of line here.

485
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:19,166
You should want more...

486
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:23,458
More for yourself
and more for Kayla.

487
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:33,208
I can't decide
if it's worse

488
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,208
if she chooses William
and he dies

489
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,291
or if she chooses me
and he lives.

490
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:39,792
You don't want him
to die.
Right, right.

491
00:22:39,834 --> 00:22:43,625
'Cause then I gotta compete
with his ghost.
Yeah, but he lives, you gotta
compete with all that money.

492
00:22:43,667 --> 00:22:46,000
It's lose-lose either way,
right?
Yes, which is why
we're here. Move on.

493
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:47,667
Move on.

494
00:22:47,709 --> 00:22:49,667
Move on.

495
00:22:49,709 --> 00:22:52,041
♪ I'm a romantic ♪

496
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:53,625
♪ I am indecisive ♪

497
00:22:53,667 --> 00:22:56,750
Brings us back
to Cooper's dilemma.

498
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,750
Would you rather have
10 to 15 years of life

499
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:02,041
or four years of sex?

500
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:03,542
Sex.
Sex.
That's not the dilemma.

501
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:06,041
The dilemma is how do I continue
working with Charlotte king?

502
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:08,041
Maybe that's why we're here.

503
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:11,041
Maybe it's you
who needs to move on.
No, I already moved on
from Charlotte.

504
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:14,625
I just can't move away from her
and her emasculating ways.

505
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:16,166
Right, right,

506
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:18,166
'cause offering standard
medical treatment to a patient

507
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:20,041
is clearly emasculating.

508
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:22,041

allowed to defend her.

my sex ed seminar

turned up a patient
with prostate cancer.

And I think I could help him,

Cooper thinks
I don't understand men.

I think you know
he's wrong.

Yeah, well,
maybe that's your problem.

547
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:05,625
Things I tell you
are privileged?

548
00:25:05,667 --> 00:25:07,417
Of course.

00:25:12,417 --> 00:25:15,834
Addison's patient,
the one in the coma...

550

I left her husband
alone in the room.

551
00:25:18,959 --> 00:25:20,208
I knew he might...

552
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:22,917
End things.

553
00:25:22,959 --> 00:25:24,667
Why'd you do it?

554
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:30,041
Well, he was there...

555
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:34,000
Staring at a woman
who wouldn't wake up.

556
00:25:34,041 --> 00:25:36,041
It seemed so cruel.

557
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:38,166
I'm backing a surgery
to save her.

558
00:25:38,208 --> 00:25:42,041
Three babies are at risk.

559
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:46,041
I'm putting my faith
in some 20-year-old kid

560
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:47,792
because I...

561
00:25:47,834 --> 00:25:50,041
Because you wanted
forgiveness.

562
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:52,834
I want to believe
I didn't do the wrong thing

563
00:25:52,875 --> 00:25:54,250
for the wrong reasons.

564
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:56,041
Well, maybe

565
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:58,834
you did the wrong thing
for the right reason.

566
00:25:58,875 --> 00:26:01,000
This thing
with me and Cooper...

567
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:06,041
Why did you
push me back to him?

568
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:09,125
Because it's what you want.

569
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:21,625
Hey.
Hey.

570
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:23,625
When did I become the man

571
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:25,625
other men
tell their problems to?

572
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:28,500
Could you tell me that?
Maybe the question is,

573
00:26:28,542 --> 00:26:31,250
when did all the men I know
become women?

574
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:34,709
Because really, it's--
you know what? Amelia is
gonna operate on Kayla.

575
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:37,667
Okay.
And she thinks I'm settling.
I'm not settling.

576
00:26:37,709 --> 00:26:40,458
Are you mad?
Yes, I'm mad. I'm mad.

577
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,291
You want to tell me
what it's about?

578
00:26:46,583 --> 00:26:49,083
You said,
"I love you, Violet."

579
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:51,208
To me. You said it to me.

580
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:53,041
I--what? I said--

581
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:55,041
when you were sick
and you had a fever,

582
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:57,041
and I know
it shouldn't upset me.

583
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:59,291
But, you know, i'm--
I'm here babysitting...

584
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:02,041
Playing peekaboo
with your kid, you know?

585
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:04,417
And i--you said,
"I love you, Violet."
Yeah,
that was six weeks ago.

586
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:07,458
You been carrying this around
for six weeks?
I'm busy. I have a job.

587
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,250
I run a practice. I have
things to do--

588
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:12,166
I'm trying, okay?

589
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:15,166
I'm trying here, Pete,
and I just need to know if--

590
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:17,166
if you...
Don't want to do this.

591
00:27:17,208 --> 00:27:20,000
Then--then I won't get
too attached.

592
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:22,000
Babe, I will
always love Violet.

593
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:24,917
She's the mother
of my child.
Okay.

594
00:27:24,959 --> 00:27:27,166
Good. I'm glad
that we cleared that up
so--no--

595
00:27:27,208 --> 00:27:29,250
so I can get my--
okay, Addison, Addison.

596
00:27:29,291 --> 00:27:32,041
That doesn't mean
I don't love you.

597
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:33,667
Mm. I love you.

598
00:27:33,709 --> 00:27:35,709
I love you.

599
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:38,375
I'm not sitting around
waiting for Violet.

600
00:27:38,417 --> 00:27:42,291
I have moved on,
and I'm happy I've moved on.

601
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:43,166
Yeah?

602
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:45,959
Yeah.

603
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,750
Okay.

604
00:27:49,792 --> 00:27:51,000
Okay?

605
00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:52,291
Yeah.

606
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:53,208
Mm.

607
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,208
Mm.

608
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,208
Mm.

609
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:56,208
Mm.

610
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,583
Mm.

611
00:28:00,083 --> 00:28:02,041
Mm.

612
00:28:08,083 --> 00:28:11,333
Are you here to talk me
out of this again? Because--

613
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:14,000
I'm here for my patients.

614
00:28:16,917 --> 00:28:20,208
Ventriculoscope is in place...

615
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:24,208
And I'm moving down
to the aqueduct.

616
00:28:26,417 --> 00:28:29,875
So far, so good.

617
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,625
You're doing great.
Keep going.

618
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:36,667
All right.
I am in the aqueduct.

619
00:28:36,709 --> 00:28:38,792
Guide is in place.

620
00:28:38,834 --> 00:28:40,125
Preparing the stent.

621
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:43,375
Almost there.

622
00:28:43,417 --> 00:28:47,250
All right, heart rate's up
to 130. 140.

623
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:50,041
She's desaturating.
She's thrown another clot.

624
00:28:50,083 --> 00:28:52,250
I'm gonna keep going.

625
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:54,166
The babies
are in distress. Sam.

626
00:28:54,208 --> 00:28:56,917
All right. I'll need time
to remove the clot.

627
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:01,500
Fetal heart rates
are in the 80s.

628
00:29:01,542 --> 00:29:03,875
Let's prep the belly.
I'm cutting her open.

629
00:29:03,917 --> 00:29:06,166
Amelia, step back.
I can do this, Addison.

630
00:29:06,208 --> 00:29:09,166
Just give Sam a chance.
So long as the babies
are in there,

631
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:10,834
she's gonna
keep throwing clots,

632
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:12,458
and they will not survive
the procedure.

633
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,041
I need
to deliver the babies now.

634
00:29:14,083 --> 00:29:20,875
Amelia, step back.
Scalpel.

635
00:29:25,583 --> 00:29:27,041
Baby number one.

636
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:30,750
Call nicu. Get three vents
and a central line set up.

637
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:35,208
Baby number two. Come on.

638
00:29:36,583 --> 00:29:39,667
Why wasn't I paged?
I have a full team here.

639
00:29:39,709 --> 00:29:43,208
I'm an attending on this case.
You could've used me.

640
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:45,250
Number three.
Sam, you're clear to go.

641
00:29:45,291 --> 00:29:47,709
She's floppy.
No spontaneous respiration.

642
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,041
I can't feel a heartbeat.

643
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:52,500
Let me assist you.
I've got it.
Set up an intubation tray.

644
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:55,000
Let me help you.
We are here
because of you.

645
00:29:55,041 --> 00:29:58,041
This baby is like this
because of you.

646
00:29:58,083 --> 00:30:01,250
The best thing you can do
right now is back off.

647
00:30:01,291 --> 00:30:03,250
Give me an e.T. Tube.

648
00:30:03,291 --> 00:30:05,166
All right. Suction.
She's aspirated.

649
00:30:05,208 --> 00:30:07,166
Is she all right?

650
00:30:07,208 --> 00:30:09,667
Okay, I'm almost there.
Almost there. Got it.

651
00:30:09,709 --> 00:30:13,250
Okay. Hold c.P.R.

652
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:15,166
There's no pulse.
Resume c.P.R.

653
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:17,583
Okay.

654
00:30:21,834 --> 00:30:23,041
Come on.

655
00:30:24,333 --> 00:30:26,625
Come on.

656
00:30:26,667 --> 00:30:28,834
Come on, baby.
Hold on.

657
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:33,041
Good. We got a rhythm...
And a pulse.

658
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:35,041
All right.
Let's get her into nicu.

659
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,583
Call an ecmo unit. This baby
needs to be on bypass.

660
00:30:37,625 --> 00:30:41,291
Have the techs meet us
at the unit. Let's go.
Is she gonna be okay?

661
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:43,375
Sam, you got this?
Yeah.

662
00:30:44,834 --> 00:30:47,125
Apparently,
you've spoken to Dr. King.

663
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:48,375
Yes.

664
00:30:48,417 --> 00:30:49,834
I told her

665
00:30:49,875 --> 00:30:52,375
that you had the right
to refuse medical treatment,

666
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:54,375
which is true.
Thank you.

667
00:30:54,417 --> 00:30:56,583
But I also think
it's wrong.

668
00:30:56,625 --> 00:30:58,041
Impotence is not

669
00:30:58,083 --> 00:31:00,458
an inevitable side effect
of radiation.

670
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,375
She said I have
a 50/50 chance

671
00:31:03,417 --> 00:31:05,250
of losing function.

672
00:31:05,291 --> 00:31:08,166
And if you come down
on the wrong side of that,

673
00:31:08,208 --> 00:31:11,166
you still have
a woman that loves you.
But I won't be able
to love her back.

674
00:31:11,208 --> 00:31:14,166
Well, maybe not in the way
that you can now.

675
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:16,166
But with the help
of Dr. King...

676
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:17,959
It's not the same.

677
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,667
Well, you're right.
It would be different.

678
00:31:20,709 --> 00:31:24,458
But these options
that Dr. King mentioned,

679
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,834
they don't have to...

680
00:31:27,875 --> 00:31:30,041
They don't make you
less of a man.

681
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:33,625
You know what it's like
to get old?

682
00:31:33,667 --> 00:31:35,834
People start doing things
for you.

683
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:39,792
They stop letting you
do things for yourself...

684
00:31:39,834 --> 00:31:42,041
Like work a job, uh,

685
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:44,041
or live in a house

686
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:48,000
or drive your own car
down the street.

687
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:49,291
I lost my wife.

688
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:52,041
My kids
have lives of their own.

689
00:31:52,083 --> 00:31:53,834
I'm stuck here.

690
00:31:53,875 --> 00:31:58,041
But there's one thing that
I can still do for myself,

691
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:01,083
one thing that makes me
feel whole.

692
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:04,041
And I'm not about
to let that be taken away

693
00:32:04,083 --> 00:32:08,000
or--or have it made
uncomfortable or unnatural.

694
00:32:11,083 --> 00:32:14,041
Well, I admit I don't know
what it's like to get old.

695
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:17,834
And when it comes to sex,
I get that.

696
00:32:17,875 --> 00:32:19,417
And when...

697
00:32:19,458 --> 00:32:21,917
You can't do it...

698
00:32:21,959 --> 00:32:25,417
I mean, that is...

699
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:28,875
Look, it happens.
It happens to every guy.

700
00:32:28,917 --> 00:32:31,041
I...

701
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:33,041
I was with a woman I loved,

702
00:32:33,083 --> 00:32:35,834
and we were fighting a lot,

703
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:38,875
and, uh... I was stressed out,

704
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:44,000
and that made it
difficult... to perform.

705
00:32:46,083 --> 00:32:48,041
And it was humiliating.

706
00:32:48,083 --> 00:32:50,041
Oh... it was.

707
00:32:50,083 --> 00:32:52,000
And so I pushed her away

708
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:54,458
and I treated her badly

709
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,458
because I was feeling like
I was less of a man.

710
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,125
I was... I was wrong.

711
00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:02,333
I was just wrong.

712
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:04,500
Mr. Schmitt,
I can't promise you

713
00:33:04,542 --> 00:33:06,500
that there'll be
no side effects

714
00:33:06,542 --> 00:33:08,500
if you do this treatment.

715
00:33:08,542 --> 00:33:11,041
But I do know
that you'll be alive

716
00:33:11,083 --> 00:33:15,041
and you will get to continue
to love Nora

717
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:18,041
for a long time to come.

718
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:21,041
You will be
the man in her life.

719
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:23,750
And that's
the most important thing.

720
00:33:33,083 --> 00:33:34,166
Sam.

721
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:38,041
Almost there. 30cc syringe.

722
00:33:41,208 --> 00:33:45,333
And clots are dissolving.

723
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:47,458
Vitals are stabilizing.

724
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,834
The rest is up to you,
Dr. Shepherd.

725
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:55,041
I almost killed her, Sam.

726
00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:56,792
And those babies--

727
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:59,875
they're in Addison's hands.

728
00:33:59,917 --> 00:34:02,417
What am I doing?

729
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:06,041
You're a doing surgery
on a woman's brain...

730
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:08,041
A-A surgery you said
only you could do...

731
00:34:08,083 --> 00:34:10,041
A surgery you fought for.

732
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:12,333
Stop standing there and start
acting like a surgeon.

733
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:14,333
You sound like Addison.

734
00:34:14,375 --> 00:34:15,792
No, I sound like you

735
00:34:15,834 --> 00:34:18,125
before you started
losing confidence in yourself.

736
00:34:18,166 --> 00:34:19,583
Amelia, can you do this?

737
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:20,500
Can you wake this woman up

738
00:34:20,542 --> 00:34:22,500
and bring her back
to her family?

739
00:34:22,542 --> 00:34:25,417
Or were just spouting
a bunch of mess

740
00:34:25,458 --> 00:34:27,458
because you like to cut?

741
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:32,792
I can do this.

742
00:34:32,834 --> 00:34:35,417
Okay, then. Go.
We don't have all day.

743
00:34:35,458 --> 00:34:37,458
Adjust the scope. Set up
the catheter for the stent.

744
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,667
Let's show your brother
he's not the only Shepherd

745
00:34:39,709 --> 00:34:44,000
who can make magic.

746
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:45,417
Attagirl.

747
00:34:48,083 --> 00:34:49,834
It didn't work.

748
00:34:49,875 --> 00:34:51,500
You don't know that.

749
00:34:51,542 --> 00:34:53,000
The other patients

750
00:34:53,041 --> 00:34:55,041
were at least
marginally responsive by now.

751
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:57,041
I freaked out, Sam.

752
00:34:57,083 --> 00:34:58,458
Maybe I took too long.

753
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:01,041
Maybe I should've stopped.
Maybe Addison was--

754
00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:04,041
she's in pain.

Well, maybe you did

from your patient?

858
00:39:45,291 --> 00:39:47,875
The opposite.
Cooper got him to come in.

859
00:39:47,917 --> 00:39:50,583
He agreed to do treatment.

860
00:39:50,625 --> 00:39:53,125
Then he wouldn't even
have a drink with me.

861
00:39:53,166 --> 00:39:55,375
But you worked together
with good results. Right?

862
00:39:55,417 --> 00:39:57,875
I mean, it's a start.

863
00:39:57,917 --> 00:40:00,667
Stop getting my hopes up.

864
00:40:00,709 --> 00:40:05,417
How long did that man wait
for his wife to wake up?

865
00:40:05,458 --> 00:40:07,583
Ah, he'll come around.

866
00:40:07,625 --> 00:40:10,583
In the meantime,
you come have a drink with me.

867
00:40:10,625 --> 00:40:13,583
I mean, you and Cooper
might not be there yet,

868
00:40:13,625 --> 00:40:15,792
but you and I
can still be friends, right?

869
00:40:15,834 --> 00:40:17,583
Right?

870
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:20,917
Yes.

871
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,625
Ahh. Mmm.

872
00:40:24,667 --> 00:40:26,583
Hey.

873
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:28,208
Oh, there you are.

874
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:30,083
Oh.

875
00:40:30,125 --> 00:40:32,041
Thank you...

876
00:40:32,083 --> 00:40:35,041
For letting me
stay here tonight.

877
00:40:35,083 --> 00:40:37,834
Amelia is at my house,
and I just...

878
00:40:37,875 --> 00:40:41,041
Just wanted it to be...
Us tonight--

879
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:45,041
just you, me...
And Lucas.

880
00:40:45,083 --> 00:40:46,625
That sounds good to me.

881
00:40:46,667 --> 00:40:48,041
Hey.

882
00:40:48,083 --> 00:40:49,625

883
