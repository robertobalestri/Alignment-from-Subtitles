Previously on
"private practice"...

3
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:11,291
The three fetuses are just too
much for your body to handle.

4
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:14,166
They're 20 weeks. A few more,
and they'll be viable.
I can't lose my wife.

5
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:16,417
How long have you been sick?
I was diagnosed
eight years ago.

6
00:00:16,458 --> 00:00:17,917
Does Naomi know?
No.

7
00:00:17,959 --> 00:00:20,750
The sex didn't have to mean
we were a happy couple again,

8
00:00:20,792 --> 00:00:23,542
but it had to mean something.
That moment has passed.
We can move on with our lives.

9
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:25,542
- I don't want to see you.
- He has a right to be mad.

10
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:27,667
You told him
you couldn't be with him

11
00:00:27,709 --> 00:00:30,041
and you started
sleeping with me.
But you are not the ex-husband
of my best friend.

12
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:33,041
I was coming up here to tell you
what happened to me today,

13
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:37,542
but it seems like
all the real action is up here.

14
00:01:09,917 --> 00:01:11,458
He's still here.

15
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,458
I can't even imagine.

16
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,000
Your wife decides to be
a surrogate,

17
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:18,000
and she ends up in a coma,

18
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:20,000
pregnant with
someone else's triplets.

19
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:22,041
He won't go home.

20
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:25,166
He just sits there,
talking to her.

21
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:27,041
It's awful.

22
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:29,041
He loves her.
Addison...

23
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:32,041
I have to check
on the fetuses.
Addison, it's not my fault.

24
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:35,041
You could've kept
your mouth shut.

25
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:37,041
She saw us. She knew.

26
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:40,458
There was nothing to see.
Nothing happened. When you--
nothing happened, really?

27
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,959
So there's--there's nothing
for Naomi to be mad about?

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,959
We never--
she saw what she saw
because it was there.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,041
Now maybe you're afraid
to act on it, but it was there.

30
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:52,041
So what are you saying, that it
would be better if we had--

31
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:54,291
I mean, if you and I
had slept together,

32
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,959
you're saying it would be okay
that Naomi is mad?
Then at least
we could be together

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,959
instead of whatever this is.
Okay, I don't know
what she is to you,

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,041
but she is important to me.
She's my--she's everything.

35
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:05,291
So then what am I?

36
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:08,250
You... have a girlfriend,
and I have Pete.

37
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:10,875
So we are nothing.
I have to go.

38
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:16,000
Eddie.

39
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:20,917
You should eat something,
have some coffee.

40
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,750
We fought about it,
you know...

41
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:27,667
Her doing this

42
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:29,375
carrying these babies.

43
00:02:29,417 --> 00:02:33,041
I told her
I didn't want her to.

44
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:36,041
I told her that we could manage
without the extra money.

45
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:38,625
Eddie,
it's not your fault.

46
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:42,166
I was already working two jobs,
and we were just scraping.

47
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:46,041
She wanted to help.

48
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:49,041
She agreed to be
a surrogate, you know, not a--

49
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:50,834
an Incubator.
I'm so sorry.

50
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:53,041
You know, what--
what if she's aware?

51
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,583
I mean, what--what if
she's in pain?

52
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:57,041
Look at her.

53
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,208
Look at her.

54
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,041
She's in limbo,
i'm... in hell,

55
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,333
and my kids are a wreck,

56
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:07,041
and all of you just sit around
hovering and--and waiting

57
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:10,041
till you can empty her out
and throw her away.

58
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,041
It's not right.
Eddie, come with me, okay?

59
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:14,041
Let's get some food
or some coffee.

60
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,041
Just some fresh air.
No.

61
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,625
You need a break.

62
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:20,041
She wouldn't want this,
to be like this.

63
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:24,041
I want to pull the plug.

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I can do that, right?

65
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,667
He wouldn't just be
pulling the plug on Kayla.

66
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:41,500
What about the babies
she's carrying?
I understand the situation.

67
00:03:41,542 --> 00:03:44,458
And it doesn't horrify you?
The fetuses aren't viable
outside of the womb.

68
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,291
Eddie asked me to explain
the process to him,

69
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:50,083
not second-guess
his moral judgments.
Well, there are
two people down the hall

70
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,875
who are the parents
of those babies.

71
00:03:52,917 --> 00:03:55,083
They should have a say.
I'm sorry Kayla's in a coma.

72
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,667
But she's not in any pain,
and if you really think

73
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:00,041
it's somehow more humane
to euthanize her than to

74
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:03,417
keep her alive long enough
to bring three babies to term--
okay, the time to stop this

75
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:06,041
was before you convinced Kayla
to roll the dice.
You--

76
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,417
calm down, the both of you.
Now we are where we are.

77
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:10,417
Even though none of us
are comfortable

78
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,417
with what Eddie wants,
Addison is right.

79
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:15,625
We're obligated to honor it.

80
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:18,041
Kayla's only one of
the patients in that room.

81
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,834
There are three others,

82
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,834
and someone
needs to protect them.

83
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:25,041
I'm gonna
talk to Angie and Simon.

84
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:29,083
You'd be killing three babies.
How can you not understand that?
You killed my wife.

85
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:32,083
Do any of you
give a damn about that?
All right, could we all just
take this into the hall?

86
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,500
We asked Eddie
to talk outside.

87
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:38,625
He wouldn't leave Kayla.
I'm sorry. I would give anything
if this hadn't happened.

88
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:42,291
Kayla is a wonderful person.
She's given us everything.

89
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,917
But she wanted to do this,
Eddie.

90
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:47,792
She wanted to carry these
babies. You know she did.
She never wanted
to live like this.

91
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:49,166
Listen to that thing.

92
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,458
It shoves air into her
and it sucks it out.

93
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,041
She's hooked up to this,
this, a-all this crap.

94
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:57,041
That's not life.
I want her to have peace.

95
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,709
She will.
Now!

96
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:05,041
I mean, I knew it was time
to move out of Naomi's house,

97
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,709
but Betsey hates
the new apartment. I hate it.

98
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,709
The carpets are beige.
The walls are beige.

99
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,041
The neighborhood is beige.
My whole life is beige.

100
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,041
Uh-huh.
Do you ever feel like you're,

101
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,792
you know, like,
just treading water?

102
00:05:15,834 --> 00:05:18,500
Nothing's moving forward.
You're standing still.

103
00:05:18,542 --> 00:05:21,750
Everybody else--
no, I don't.
Here's some free advice.

104
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:24,500
Kindergarten's over.
Training wheels are off.

105
00:05:24,542 --> 00:05:27,041
Nobody's gonna catch you
if you fall.

106
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:29,500
If you don't like your life,
you do something about it.

107
00:05:29,542 --> 00:05:31,166
You reach down,

108
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,583
you pull one foot out of
the mud, then the other.

109
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,000
You walk away from it.
You can't walk, you crawl.

110
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,792
You do something. Join a gym.
Join a club. Join a cult.

111
00:05:38,834 --> 00:05:40,375
Do something, anything.

112
00:05:40,417 --> 00:05:42,625
What you don't do
is whine to me about it.

113
00:05:50,542 --> 00:05:52,083
What?

114
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,959
Addison is heartbroken
you won't speak with her.

115
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:57,208
I'm not gonna
talk about it.

116
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,041
If you want to talk about work,
that's fine.

117
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,750
Okay. Well, Lucas is sick.
The nanny just called.

118
00:06:02,792 --> 00:06:05,000
She's sick now, too,
so I gotta go.

119
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:08,250
I'll probably be out
a day or two.
Okay, whatever you need.

120
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,542
Pete.

121
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:13,125
I hope the little guy
feels better.

122
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,959
Thank you.

123
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:21,041
Okay, I-I-I know we should
talk about the kissing.

124
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,041
And I haven't been
avoiding you.

125
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,458
I haven't.
It's just that, uh...

126
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,041
I'm seeing William,
and i--

127
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:30,166
William's out of the country.
Switzerland, on business.

128
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:33,291
No, he's not. No.
We have a date tonight.

129
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:36,375
It's canceled.

130
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:38,291
He left? For how long?

131
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:41,458
He didn't say.
And he told you?

132
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,458
Wow.

133
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,667
That's great.

134
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:49,000
Yeah, that's just...

135
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,000
Great.

136
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,667
Naomi.

137
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:01,291
This is the money I owe you
for the buy-in on the practice.

138
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:04,917
I know I was kind of
a jerk about it at the time,

139
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,208
but thank you.
Thank you for floating me.
You sure you can afford it?

140
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,834
Yeah. I'm good. I've been
putting money aside.

141
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,333
Didn't want the debt
hanging over me.

142
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:16,458
I never made an issue of it.
Wasn't about the money.
Yeah, money's usually
about something else.

143
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,041
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing.

144
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,041
You lent me money.
I'm paying you back.

145
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:24,208
I'm trying to be a grown-up.
I feel good about it.
Is Violet back?

146
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,208
Because this whole
grown-up thing sounds like--

147
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,959
she's not back.
I'm growing up all on my own.

148
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,750
Take the check.

149
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:39,458
Is this the last thing
between us?

150
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,458
Don't make it
more than it is.

151
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,125
You're the one who said
money's not about money.

152
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:46,834
Sometimes it is.

153
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,250
What are you doing?

154
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,583
Charlotte,
this isn't the--

155
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,959
shut up, Sheldon.

156
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:18,625
How long till
the babies are viable?

157
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:22,041
Six, seven weeks.
Look, if you would
just give us that.

158
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,959
- No.
- Mr. Lindy.

159
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,041
I'm Charlotte king,
hospital chief of staff.

160
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,041
Thank you for coming.

161
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,500
Uh... I have
a medical power of attorney,

162
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:33,333
and I want to take my wife
off of life support.

163
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,834
She's carrying our babies.
Now I told you
what I want--

164
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:38,417
we got a lawyer.

165
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,041
Look...

166
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,750
We didn't want this
to become a legal thing,

167
00:08:42,792 --> 00:08:45,041
but now...
Maybe it has to.

168
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,041
- You don't have the right.
- Actually, Mr. Lindy,

169
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,041
a judge will have to
decide that.

170
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,208
I suggest you get
an attorney of your own.

171
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,041
But she's my wife.

172
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,041
I know that,
and I'm so sorry.

173
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:58,250
But as of right now, I need
everyone out of this room.

174
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,875
I'm not leaving.

175
00:08:59,917 --> 00:09:02,458
You are. Till this is legally
resolved, I have to act.

176
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,208
Essential medical personnel
only in this room.

177
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,208
I-I'm not leaving
my wife alone.

178
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,583
I'm not keeping my kids
from seeing their mother.

179
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:13,041
I really am sorry.

180
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:16,166
How did you
let this happen?

181
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,834
I want to
help him somehow.

182
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,834
Well, there's nothing
we can do.

183
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:30,834
It's a legal thing,
not medical. We're out of it.

184
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:34,250
It's just horrible. There are
no--no good options.
Sometimes, it's--

185
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,208
just let her go.
No. Nai.

186
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,208
Sam and I never meant to have
feelings for each other.

187
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,208
It just happened.

188
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,375
But it never went anywhere
because of you.

189
00:09:46,417 --> 00:09:49,125
- Please don't be mad at me.
- Mad?

190
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,750
Nai.

191
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:54,041
Did you ever love me?

192
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,458
Don't be ridiculous.

193
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,417
Was I second choice?
When did all this start?

194
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:59,417
When--when we were
in med school?
No.

195
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,750
Wh-when you were maid of honor
at my wedding?

196
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:03,667
It's not like that, Naomi.

197
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:06,667
It is like that.
I-I can't stop wondering.

198
00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:09,250
Everything is tainted
with this.

199
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:11,667
He--he is the father

200
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:14,041
of my child, Addison,
and there's a bond there,

201
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,250
and maybe I shouldn't
expect you to understand that.

202
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:20,041
But you don't get friendship?
That's why we backed off,
Naomi, friendship.

203
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,166
God, I...
I'm second-guessing

204
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:25,166
everything that has
ever happened between us.

205
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:29,041
I've lost every good memory
of our marriage...

206
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,041
And of our friendship.

207
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:34,500
No, no,
I am not mad.

208
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,875
You two have...

209
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:39,959
Broken my heart.

210
00:10:45,917 --> 00:10:47,250
Pete?

211
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,583
In the kitchen.

212
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,333
We left
his special blanket here.

213
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,333
I thought it would help
calm him down.

214
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,125
Oh. Are you sick?
Oh.

215
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,125
Aw, you have a fever.
Oh, yeah, stay away.

216
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:59,083
You don't want this.
Trust me.

217
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,125
I-I felt fine
a couple of hours ago.

218
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:04,041
Oh, you shouldn't have to take
care of him when you're sick.

219
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,041
Yeah, well, it doesn't work
that way. It's my job.

220
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,333
You know what?
Let me help.

221
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,959
I'll take care of him.
You guys have stuff here.

222
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,959
Just go upstairs
and go to sleep.
Are you sure?
He's got a fever.

223
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,542
He's gonna be cranky.

224
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,959
My house, my rules.
I'm a baby doctor.

225
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,542
We will be fine.
All right? Go to bed.

226
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,542
Thank you.

227
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:24,041
Huh?
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

228
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,166
Binge eating.

229
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,625
Oh, just shut up.

230
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:33,625
William leaving
gets you that upset?

231
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:36,041
No. There are a lot of things.
There are--

232
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:39,041
there are a lot of things
that are wrong at once.

233
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,041
Do you want
to talk about it?

234
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:44,041
No. What I want is for this
to make me feel better.

235
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,542
Put the chocolate down
and come here.
Oh, Gabriel--

236
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:49,000
chocolate down now.

237
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:56,208
What?

238
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,417
Come here.

239
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,417
Sit down.
No--

240
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,375
sit down.

241
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,125
Mm.

242
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,834
Now isn't that
better than chocolate?

243
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,834
So, um, why are you here
instead of Dr. Montgomery?

244
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,875
She has someone
sick at home.
The baby
just hit eight months.

245
00:12:46,917 --> 00:12:49,125
I was hoping she'd tell me
it was time to get off the couch

246
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,125
and just let the baby
come when it comes.

247
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,125
Bed rest is starting
to make me crazy.

248
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,917
Well, maybe I can tell you that
after I do the exam. Okay.

249
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:57,709
You're really young,
aren't you?

250
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,041
How long since you
got out of med school?

251
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,083
I'm not a doctor.
I'm a midwife.

252
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:05,041
Is she really unavailable?

253
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,417
Can we call her?

254
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:10,000
Okay. Yeah.

255
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:12,250
Just explain to her that
you have to check her cervix.

256
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,250
If it's dilated,
send her to the hospital.

257
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:16,667
If not, just check again
tomorrow, okay?

258
00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:20,041
No, I know all that. Uh, she
just wanted to consult you.

259
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,917
Can't we just reschedule?!
No offense.

260
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:27,667
Come on, baby.
Try to relax.

261
00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:31,875
Uh, Addison, uh,
is everything okay?
He's just been up all night.

262
00:13:31,917 --> 00:13:34,250
I can't... get him
to be comfortable.

263
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,083
I'm good with babies, Dell.

264
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,542
I am. It's my job
to be good with babies.

265
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,542
But I cannot
get him comfortable.

266
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,041
Huh? Come on.

267
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,041
Addison, Addison,
just--just hold him.

268
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,500
You know, talk softly to him,

269
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:49,166
let him feel your heartbeat
and smell your presence...
Yeah?

270
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:51,166
And, uh,
listen to your voice.

271
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:53,542
Just talk to him calmly,
smile at him, and just,

272
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,709
you know, keep doing that
till it works.

273
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,083
Sometimes with a sick baby,

274
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:59,083
it's not so much
about doing something

275
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,542
as being something.
Being something. Okay.

276
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:03,625
Okay. Thanks, Dell. Bye.

277
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,959
Wow. You're good.

278
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,959
Check whatever you need
to check.

279
00:14:16,792 --> 00:14:19,458
Thank you.

280
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:24,000
Am I not allowed
to sit in the hall now?

281
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,000
I know
you won't believe this,

282
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,375
but I hate this
as much as you do.

283
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:31,458
No... you don't.

284
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,250
You can't.

285
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:36,250
Have you talked to anyone?
Someone who could help you.

286
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,250
Help me what, fight them?

287
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,875
I've called three lawyers.

288
00:14:39,917 --> 00:14:42,875
All of 'em want money
that I don't have.

289
00:14:42,917 --> 00:14:46,542
They all say that it'll take
time that I don't have.

290
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:49,583
You won't even let me
be in there with my wife.

291
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:52,041
All of you say that Kayla...

292
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,000
Doesn't know
that I'm there.

293
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:59,792
But I know that she does.

294
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:07,417
This is an attorney
at a nonprofit aid group.

295
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:11,208
Tell 'em I referred you.

296
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:16,709
Why are you helping me?

297
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,250
Just call.

298
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,542
Sometimes you surprise me.

299
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,542
I have a role
at the hospital.

300
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:38,041
Doesn't mean
I don't feel for him.

301
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,959
So you want him
to pull the plug?

302
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,041
He's sitting there alone.
I know what that's like.

303
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,834
Yeah. Okay.

304
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,834
Don't look at me like that.

305
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:50,333
I have feelings just like
a real person, Sam.

306
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,959
He's alone. He has to
stare through a window

307
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,917
at someone who just isn't
there anymore.

308
00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:57,917
He needs it to be over.
At any cost?

309
00:15:57,959 --> 00:15:59,375
I'm not saying he's right.

310
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:02,875
I'm saying
he deserves to be heard.

311
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:15,125
You're saying I need
to keep lying here.

312
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:17,125
Probably for another
couple of days.

313
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:20,041
I'd like to come back tomorrow
and recheck you if that's okay.

314
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:23,750
Worst part is, I can't even
take care of my kid.

315
00:16:23,792 --> 00:16:26,875
Megan, she's 4.
She should be home any minute.

316
00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:29,375
I sent her to school
with a cough today,

317
00:16:29,417 --> 00:16:31,208
'cause if she was here,
I would've gotten up and...

318
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,792
She looked at me with
these eyes, said she was fine.

319
00:16:34,834 --> 00:16:36,792
Yeah, I know the look.
You have kids?

320
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:39,041
A daughter, 8.

321
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:42,375
I thought I could
do it all, you know--

322
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:44,542
mother, provider,
super woman.

323
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:48,041
But now I'm like
a sick kid on the couch.

324
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,375
I'm moving backwards.

325
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:54,917
Bye, Emma. Mommy!

326
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,917
Hey! Thanks, dena.
Hi, pumpkin.

327
00:16:57,959 --> 00:16:59,291
Oh.

328
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,959
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

329
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,667
You know, when I come back
to check you tomorrow,

330
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:09,166
I'll--I'll try and rope in
our pediatrician, okay?
Thank you.

331
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:19,041
Oh. You're missing
some buttons there, stud muffin.

332
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,834
They're not missing.
Oh, you like getting
your shirt ripped off?

333
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:25,041
I can't fight you right now.
I have to see a patient.
I'm not looking
for a rematch.

334
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:27,417
Your relationship's
none of my business.

335
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,834
Yeah, well, to be clear,
it's not a relationship.

336
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,375
It's just... sex.

337
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,041
None of my business.

338
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,667
No need to share.

339
00:17:34,709 --> 00:17:37,041
Sorry. I don't mean
to be insensitive.

340
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:39,041
I'm just having a good time.

341
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,500
I've never had
this much of a good time

342
00:17:41,542 --> 00:17:43,291
with a woman before.

343
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:46,500
Again, I'm oversharing,
so I'm just gonna go.

344
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,834
What?

345
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,250
You got something to say?

346
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:53,667
No. Nothing.

347
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,583
You don't happen to have
a needle and thread?

348
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:02,583
My shirt--some of the buttons
just fell off.
Uh, yeah.

349
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,041
Cheap shirt.

350
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,709
Here you go.

351
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,959
Thanks.

352
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,667
Mm-hmm.

353
00:18:10,709 --> 00:18:13,750
You want to talk about it?

354
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:17,125
Uh, no.
You want someone
to eat chocolate with?

355
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:20,041
Are you trying to be funny?
No. I think
talking is better.

356
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,959
But since you didn't
want to talk--

357
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,959
I like to work within
someone's comfort zone.
Oh. Well, okay.
Uh, chocolate's not helping.

358
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,041
- Must be bad.
- Yeah. Yeah.

359
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:32,041
And the worst part is,
the people I would normally

360
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,041
go to
to talk about it, I can't.

361
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:37,041
So...
Well, you and I
aren't that close,

362
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,458
but my door is always open.

363
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,333
Thank you.

364
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,583
Actually, most of the time,
it's closed.

365
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:46,333
My clients
seem to prefer it that way.

366
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,375
Well, look, since you
don't want to talk,

367
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:51,083
let me just ask you this--

368
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:53,083
is there something that might
make you feel better?

369
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,792
I mean, not talking,
not chocolate...

370
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:58,041
Uh, I don't know.
Um...

371
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:00,542
Well, I see something.

372
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,458
Um... it's fife.

373
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,583
Oh.
It's fife, okay?

374
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:07,583
And... I-i-i don't
even know how I feel about him,

375
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:10,375
but, uh, he
kissed me yesterday.

376
00:19:10,417 --> 00:19:13,041
And, uh, well, you asked
if there was something

377
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:16,000
that would
make me feel better--
so go with feeling better.

378
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:18,000
I-I couldn't.
I wouldn't even...

379
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:20,000
I-I don't even know
what I want, so--

380
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,041
what, intimacy is more wrong
than chocolate?

381
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,917
I mean, I think if it
makes you feel better--
yeah, but I-I wouldn't even
know what to do.

382
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:28,041
Because of the chair?
Uh, no,
because of everything.

383
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,041
But, uh, yeah, I-I guess
the chair does make it

384
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,834
a little more confusing.

385
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,041
Oh, god. This is humiliating.
I don't want to talk.

386
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:37,041
Talking is not good.

387
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:40,041
Okay, okay, I-I understand,
but in terms of the chair,

388
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,834
that particular impediment,
you should talk to Charlotte.

389
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:45,333
She knows a lot about sex.
I can't talk to Charlotte.

390
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,417
We--no, I-I took her job.

391
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,375
We have a mutual contempt.
I--

392
00:19:49,417 --> 00:19:51,375
but she knows a lot
about sex--

393
00:19:51,417 --> 00:19:53,458
a lot.

394
00:19:54,917 --> 00:19:58,041
And you deserve
to feel better.

395
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,000
So... thanks.

396
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:06,041
Okay, Lucas, I'm gonna extract
some mucus from your nose.

397
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,250
Yeah, you're gonna feel
a slight pinch,

398
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,750
but then you're gonna be able
to breathe, okay?

399
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:13,625
Here we go. No, Lucas.
I need you to stay still. Okay?

400
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:16,625
Oh, gosh. Okay. When you grown
up, you're gonna find out that

401
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:19,875
there's all sorts of things
that you can't fix, but then

402
00:20:19,917 --> 00:20:22,375
there are certain things
that you can fix, like this.

403
00:20:22,417 --> 00:20:24,792
And if you just let me, you're
gonna feel so much better.

404
00:20:24,834 --> 00:20:27,041
Okay? But I need you to...

405
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:30,208
Oh, Lucas, I don't want to kill
you. I just want your snot.

406
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,834
He won't be still.
His nose is stuffed up,

407
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,834
and he won't let me clear it.

408
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,834
He acts like I'm trying
to suck out his brain.

409
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,834
And he's been crying
since I've been alive.

410
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:41,709
Cooper, how do people do this?
Did you really bring me here
to do a bulb syringe?

411
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,083
Yes.

412
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,041
Oh, you're a doctor.

413

You're my friend.

an arrogant

415
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,667
and impatient doctor?

416
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:53,166
Bulb syringe.

417
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,542
Boop-boop-boop.

418
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,417
Yeah. Shh, shh.
Doo-doo-doo-do-do.

Okay.

420

No, no, no, no, no.
He hates me.

421
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:11,750
He's angry and sick. He threw up
on me. And nothing I do helps.

422
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:14,041
I--I've never felt so
ineffective. I don't like it.

423
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,709
Do you think it's because
I'm not his mother?

424
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,709
I mean,
do you think he knows,

425
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,083
like, I'm the wrong person
to be doing this?

426
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:24,041
The right person is the person
that's there for him.

427
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,417
Okay, you put him
in a lukewarm bath.

428
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:29,083
It's gonna feel good
on his skin.

429
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:32,291
It's gonna help calm him down.
I gotta go.

Uh, well, you know, she's...
She's never--

503
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:56,625
why not ask your colleague--
Dr. Fife?

504
00:24:56,667 --> 00:24:58,500
Go right to the source,
so to speak.

505
00:24:58,542 --> 00:25:00,041
Think he'd be embarrassed?

506
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,542
Are you gonna help
with my patient or not?

507
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:04,500
Sometimes when people
need help,

508
00:25:04,542 --> 00:25:07,166
they need to own it,
ask for it, be direct,

509
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:09,291
instead of
beating around the bush,

510
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:11,083
using intermediaries.

511
00:25:11,125 --> 00:25:15,083
I want to know about
having sex with Dr. Fife, okay?

512
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:16,917
Are you satisfied?

513
00:25:16,959 --> 00:25:20,041
Oh, yes. Maybe this will
help you get satisfied.

514
00:25:21,417 --> 00:25:26,041
It's, uh, all about
the mechanics...

515
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:29,125
And what the able-bodied person
has to do to make it work.

516
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:30,750
Hmm.

517
00:25:30,792 --> 00:25:32,792
That kind of thing.

518
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,875
Thank you.

519
00:25:38,917 --> 00:25:40,750
Naomi.

520
00:25:40,792 --> 00:25:43,959
The question is,
does he do it for you?

521
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,083
'Cause if he does,
the wheelchair doesn't matter.

522
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:54,333
Please calm down, Lucas.

523
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:58,375
Please. I know you feel awful,
but I'm here for you. I am.

524
00:25:58,417 --> 00:26:02,583
I have been here for you,
and I'm trying. I really am.

525
00:26:02,625 --> 00:26:04,041
I'm good with babies.

526
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:07,041
I have always
been good with babies.

527
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:10,250
I am a baby doctor
because I'm good with babies.

528
00:26:10,291 --> 00:26:11,917
Lucas.

529
00:26:11,959 --> 00:26:14,291
Maybe I'm not a mother,
but I wanted to be.

530
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:17,667
I did. I wanted to be a mother
more than you know. Lucas.

531
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:20,041
Come on, Lucas.

532
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:22,667
I want to be good,
and I want to understand.

533
00:26:22,709 --> 00:26:24,667
What do you want me to do?

534
00:26:24,709 --> 00:26:27,041
What can I do
to make you feel better?

535
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:30,333
Let me make you feel better.
Let me make you feel better.

536
00:26:30,375 --> 00:26:32,625
Yeah. Oh.

537
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:34,208
Oh, thank you.

538
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:37,125
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

539
00:26:37,166 --> 00:26:39,667
Thank you.

540
00:26:39,709 --> 00:26:42,041
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

541
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:45,417
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

542
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:48,875
Ah! Ow.

543
00:26:48,917 --> 00:26:51,458
Okay, I got Megan
settled upstairs.

544
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,542
Okay? I called 9-1-1.
The paramedics should be here--

545
00:26:54,583 --> 00:26:56,208
when?

546
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:59,417
Oh, Dell. I should've
been a better patient.

547
00:26:59,458 --> 00:27:02,417
I should've stayed
on the cou--ah! Ow!
Okay, okay, okay,
listen to me, listen to me.

548
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:05,500
I need you to push again
on three, okay?
Okay.

549
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:07,667
One, two, three.
Aah!

550
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,875
Aah!

551
00:27:09,917 --> 00:27:12,041
I can't. I can't.

552
00:27:12,083 --> 00:27:13,792
I can't push.
Okay, okay.

553
00:27:13,834 --> 00:27:16,041
Everything okay?

554
00:27:16,083 --> 00:27:18,542
Uh, the baby's crowning,
but, um...

555
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:21,041
But--but what?
But what?!

556
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:24,250
The b--the baby,
he's stuck.

557
00:27:24,291 --> 00:27:25,333
Oh!

558
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:27,458
Okay.
Ohh!

559
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,000
I heard from both lawyers
and all the doctors.

560
00:27:30,041 --> 00:27:32,917
And while I'm not eager
to make a legal ruling

561
00:27:32,959 --> 00:27:37,041
in what is clearly so intensely
personal a conflict,

562
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:41,041
apparently that is
the only way to settle this?

563
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:43,041
All right.

564
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:46,291
Although Mr. Lindy's
medical power of attorney

565
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:49,041
arguably exempts him
from culpability

566
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:51,083
under this state's
fetal homicide ban,

567
00:27:51,125 --> 00:27:53,083
the equities of the situation

568
00:27:53,125 --> 00:27:56,417
favor the preservation
of three potential lives.

569
00:27:56,458 --> 00:28:00,041
Given that the mother,
Kayla Lindy, isn't in pain

570
00:28:00,083 --> 00:28:02,750
and wouldn't suffer
an undue burden

571
00:28:02,792 --> 00:28:05,208
as a result of remaining
on life support--

572
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:09,083
what about our undue burden--
me, my kids?
Mr. Lindy.

573
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:11,542
Accordingly,
all reasonable efforts

574
00:28:11,583 --> 00:28:13,959
shall be made to continue
Mrs. Lindy's life

575
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,667
until such time
as the three fetuses

576
00:28:16,709 --> 00:28:19,125
are viable outside her body
as determined

577
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:22,959
by a competent
medical professional.

578
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,959
St. ambrose hospital
is hereby ordered

579
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,208
to keep
Kayla Lindy's room closed

580
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:31,959
to all except essential
medical personnel

581
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,375
until the delivery
of the fetuses.
You can't do that.

582
00:28:34,417 --> 00:28:36,542
You can't keep him
away from his wife

583
00:28:36,583 --> 00:28:40,041
for the next two
or three months.
What's clear, doctor, is this
is emotional and volatile.

584
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:42,041
And it is
this court's obligation

585
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:44,417
to protect the health
of those three fetuses.

586
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:52,417
Okay.

587
00:28:52,458 --> 00:28:54,417
Okay, what's happening?
Please tell me.

588
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:56,417
Okay, the--the baby's
shoulder's stuck.

589
00:28:56,458 --> 00:29:00,041
I'm--I'm gonna try
to shift the position. Okay?
Okay?

590
00:29:00,083 --> 00:29:01,500
Okay?
Here we go.

591
00:29:01,542 --> 00:29:04,166
Ow! Ow! Ugh! What the hell
is going on?!
Okay.

592
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:06,667
The baby's shoulder
won't clear the birth canal.

593
00:29:06,709 --> 00:29:09,041
But the paramedics,
they'll be here soon, right?
Yeah.

594
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:12,208
Right? It'll be okay.
The paramedics
aren't gonna get here in time

595
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,834
for you to deliver
at the hospital.
Well...

596
00:29:14,875 --> 00:29:16,458
Okay. Okay, what's next?

597
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,083
Listen, I'm gonna
get you through this.

598
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:20,875
Okay?
Okay.

599
00:29:20,917 --> 00:29:22,208
Okay.
Okay.

600
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:24,834
Oh, oh.

601
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:42,750
I'm sorry.

602
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:53,583
We almost never spent
a night apart.

603
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,625
Not for anything.

604
00:29:57,583 --> 00:29:59,458
And now...

605
00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:03,709
How I can I
not be with her now?

606
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:09,125
She knows how you feel,
Eddie.
Does she?

607
00:30:09,166 --> 00:30:11,125
Does she understand
why I'm not there,

608
00:30:11,166 --> 00:30:14,125
why I'm not with her?

609
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:20,083
I tried
talking to the judge.

610
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:23,375
She won't change her mind.

611
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:35,208
This is great information.
Useful.

612
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,333
You were not
supposed to see this.

613
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:39,500
I'm so sorry
that was on my desk.

614
00:30:39,542 --> 00:30:42,125
I'm--I'm very, very sorry.
And i'm... really humiliated.

615
00:30:42,166 --> 00:30:45,291
Can we just please pretend
like this never happened?

616
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:47,375
Are you kidding me?
I've never been propositioned

617
00:30:47,417 --> 00:30:49,000
with educational
literature before.

618
00:30:49,041 --> 00:30:51,709
It's kind of a turn on.

619
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:55,083
Naomi, if you had questions,
why didn't you just ask me?

620
00:30:55,125 --> 00:30:57,583
W-- I wasn't sure
what I wanted.

621
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:01,542
I'm not sure about anything.

622
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:04,041
I can't tell you
how you feel.

623
00:31:04,083 --> 00:31:07,041
But I can tell you
how I feel.

624
00:31:07,083 --> 00:31:09,583
I like you. I want you.

625
00:31:09,625 --> 00:31:12,458
I can have sex.

626
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,417
And if you're interested,

627
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:17,417
we can take a bottle of wine
back to my place,

628
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:20,208
make out like teenagers,
see what happens.

629
00:31:22,083 --> 00:31:23,542
It hurts.

630
00:31:23,583 --> 00:31:25,542
I know.
It's gonna be okay.

631
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:28,834
She didn't pick up.

632
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:31,041
Okay.

633
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,250
Okay.

634
00:31:37,291 --> 00:31:39,625
So, um...

635
00:31:39,667 --> 00:31:42,041
Yeah, uh... okay.

636
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:45,792
I want you to press down
just below her belly, hard.

637
00:31:45,834 --> 00:31:48,500
And I'll free the shoulder.
How?

638
00:31:48,542 --> 00:31:51,291
I'll force it free.
You might break
the clavicle.

639
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:53,291
Yeah, that's the idea.
You'll break what?

640
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:55,041
You--you--

641
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:57,709
you can't break my baby.
No, no,
no, no, sweetie. No.

642
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:01,041
Dell, you can't intentionally
fracture a clavicle.

643
00:32:01,083 --> 00:32:03,000
It's crazy.
Yeah, but it's a real thing.

644
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:04,750
It's called
a wood screw maneuver.

645
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:07,125
No, I-I know what it's called.
Have you ever performed one?

646
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:10,041
Well, I've seen it done. Look,
we have to get the baby out.

647
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:12,542
You--you want
to break my baby?

648
00:32:12,583 --> 00:32:15,083
I want to save him.

649
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:17,041
Let's do it.

650
00:32:17,083 --> 00:32:19,750
All right.
Okay.

651
00:32:19,792 --> 00:32:21,917
Listen to me.

652
00:32:21,959 --> 00:32:24,333
Everything's
going to be okay.

653
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:27,750
Your baby's
going to be fine.

654
00:32:27,792 --> 00:32:31,041
When I tell you to push,
I need you to push.

655
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:32,083
Okay.

656
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:34,208
Okay?

657
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:35,834
Ready?

658
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:37,750
Okay.

659
00:32:37,792 --> 00:32:39,375
Push.

660
00:32:44,709 --> 00:32:47,542
Oh. Oh.

661
00:32:47,583 --> 00:32:49,750
Come on, Milo.

662
00:32:49,792 --> 00:32:51,875
Oh, trust me, buddy.

663
00:32:51,917 --> 00:32:53,875
You don't not
want to catch this.

664
00:32:53,917 --> 00:32:55,166
Oh.

665
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:56,959
♪ Good-bye ♪

666
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,542

669
00:33:03,583 --> 00:33:05,750

Thanks.

671
00:33:09,208 --> 00:33:11,041
Oh.
I brought you some soup.

672
00:33:11,083 --> 00:33:13,375
Chicken noodle?
Nope.
Chicken and brown rice.

673
00:33:13,417 --> 00:33:15,375
It's better for you
than the noodles.

674
00:33:17,417 --> 00:33:21,041
So, uh, the judge ruled
in favor of Angie and Simon.

Here for another consult?

721
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:30,542
Actually, I was wondering if
you'd like to have dinner later.

722
00:35:30,583 --> 00:35:34,667
Dinner? The two of us?
You and me, like a date?

723
00:35:34,709 --> 00:35:36,667
Yeah, well, I thought
it'd be nice to--

724
00:35:36,709 --> 00:35:40,041
- we don't have to call it a date.
- We can call it an appetizer.

725
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:42,667
Guess what this guy
just did.

726
00:35:42,709 --> 00:35:46,333
He saved two lives in the field
with no equipment. No fear.

727
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:48,542
No whining?
No whining.

728
00:35:48,583 --> 00:35:51,083
Nice.

729
00:35:54,625 --> 00:35:58,583
You know what? Let's skip
straight to the entrée.

730
00:35:58,625 --> 00:36:00,500
Charlotte.
What?

731
00:36:00,542 --> 00:36:02,041
Probably,
I'm thinking too much.

732
00:36:02,083 --> 00:36:04,417
My mother always told me
I think too much.

733
00:36:04,458 --> 00:36:07,041
Paul Simon wrote a song
about that.
You want to or not?

734
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:09,834
Of course I want to,
but there's a, um,

735
00:36:09,875 --> 00:36:13,583
I'm not sure--you know,
when you--when you try to--

736
00:36:13,625 --> 00:36:15,583
good god, Sheldon.
Just say it.

737
00:36:15,625 --> 00:36:17,583
You're still in love
with him.

738
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:21,041
You're trying to Bury your
feelings with mindless sex and--
and?

739
00:36:21,083 --> 00:36:23,041
And it's a bad idea.

740
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:25,625
It's a bad idea
not to be lonely?

741
00:36:25,667 --> 00:36:27,333
No, but it's unhealthy
for you

742
00:36:27,375 --> 00:36:29,333
when what you really want
is him.

743
00:36:29,375 --> 00:36:31,375
You should talk to him.
I mean, I don't know

744
00:36:31,417 --> 00:36:34,041
if you and Cooper can
work out your problems--

745
00:36:34,083 --> 00:36:36,583
you know what?
Eat by yourself.

746
00:36:41,917 --> 00:36:43,667
Manual?

747
00:36:43,709 --> 00:36:46,458
We don't need
no stinkin' manual.

748
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,625
It was amazing.

749
00:36:48,667 --> 00:36:51,083
And I was out of practice.

750
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,041
I should go.

751
00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:03,208
What?

752
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,458
Oh.

753
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,625

What--what must you

756
00:37:10,667 --> 00:37:12,625
I mean, William's gone
for five minutes,

757
00:37:12,667 --> 00:37:15,083
and I just jump into bed
with you?
I'm not complaining.

758
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:18,667
No, this is not who I am. This
is not what I'm like, really.

759
00:37:18,709 --> 00:37:20,667
I mean, just to--
to be a cheater.

760
00:37:20,709 --> 00:37:23,917
I'm a cheat-y cheater,
and I hate cheaters.

00:37:23,959 --> 00:37:26,083
Hmm?

762
00:37:26,125 --> 00:37:29,500
I should end it.

763
00:37:29,542 --> 00:37:32,083
With William,
I should...

764
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:35,083
I should. I don't want
to be that kind of person.

Oh, what does--what does
William need with me anyway?

767
