00:00:07,166 --> 00:00:09,000
Eleanor Bergen.

3
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:12,625
23 weeks in, the o.B. Noticed
an abnormality with the baby.

4
00:00:12,667 --> 00:00:15,792
She's here today for
a 3-d ultrasound to follow up.

5
00:00:15,834 --> 00:00:18,417
Whoa.
I know.

6
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:22,125
Well, there's a buildup
of cerebrospinal fluid.
Doctors split
on what to do here.

7
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:25,458
Some say wait as long
as possible to take the baby,

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,667
then clear it once it's out.
Well, if the swelling continues,
the baby could have

9
00:00:28,709 --> 00:00:31,125
severe brain damage and possibly
rupture the mother's uterus.

10
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:34,125
Well, that's the other camp.
They say deliver the baby now.

11
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:37,667
23 weeks is way too soon.
Or terminate.

12
00:00:37,709 --> 00:00:40,875
Eleanor and her husband
didn't know what to do,

13
00:00:40,917 --> 00:00:43,875
so they called me, and I
called you to break the tie.

14
00:00:43,917 --> 00:00:45,875
That's the husband.
Hi, Ronald.

15
00:00:45,917 --> 00:00:48,667
This is the doctor
I was telling you about.
Hi, Addison Montgomery.

16
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:51,041
Thank you so much for coming.
My wife and I

17
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:53,041
a little freaked,
a lot freaked, actually.

18
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:54,917
We look at the scan,
at the baby's head...

19
00:00:54,959 --> 00:00:57,417
And she's in there praying
that you're not gonna tell us

20
00:00:57,458 --> 00:01:01,125
to give up.
Let's, uh, take a look
and we'll talk after, okay?

21
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:14,083
This is my wife...
Eleanor.

22
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:23,041
Well, maybe this is
my penance for pushing.

23
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,208
El...
I never thought I'd have
a child until I met Ron,

24
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,750
and then we just both thought,
why not?

25
00:01:28,792 --> 00:01:31,458
Why not try for everything?
So it was a year

26
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,041
of looking for an egg donor,
three cycles of I.V.F.

27
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:39,125
Now look. Just look.
What were we thinking?

28
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:40,875
Congenital hydrocephalus

29
00:01:40,917 --> 00:01:43,417
isn't necessarily correlated
with a mother's age.

30
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:47,125
"Necessarily" being
the operative word.
It's a waste of time
to feel guilty.

31
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:51,041
This is our baby.
This is our chance.
If Eleanor were to
stay here and be monitored,

32
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:53,750
would it be safe for her to
continue with the pregnancy?

33
00:01:53,792 --> 00:01:55,875
I wouldn't, but there
could be another option.

34
00:01:55,917 --> 00:01:58,041
I might be able to do
what's called

35
00:01:58,083 --> 00:01:59,959
an in-utero
intracranial septostomy.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Meaning I'd go in
through the uterus

37
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,542
and into the baby's brain,

38
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:06,458
create a hole
between the ventricles.

39
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,542
That would drain
some of the fluid

40
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:12,041
and relieve the pressure.
Brain surgery
while the baby's inside me?

41
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:14,083
Is that... safe?

42
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:18,125
He means, is it safe
for a woman my age?

43
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:19,959
Maya.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,959
I'm leaving now
if you want a ride to school.

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,333
I'll catch the bus.

46
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:26,583
All right. Sit near
the emergency exit.

47
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:29,083
Love you. Bye.

48
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,625
Oh...

49
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:44,125
What the hell is that?

50
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,959
Um... clothes and makeup.

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,333
And you were just gonna wait
until I left

52
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:52,041
so you could go to school
dressed like that?
This is how all girls dress.

53
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:54,583
Not this girl.
You have five seconds

54
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:57,750
to get upstairs, wash your face
and put on something decent.

55
00:02:57,792 --> 00:03:01,041
We'll discuss how long
you're grounded later.
You're ruining my life.

56
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:04,000
What did you say?
Excuse me. What did you say?

57
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:06,083
Nothing!

58
00:03:09,834 --> 00:03:11,458
She's 60 years old, Addison.

59
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,458
The risks of major surgery--
stroke, arrhythmia,

60
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,041
getting her off the ventilator--
they're all much higher.
It's still the best option.

61
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:20,041
For the baby, maybe.
But not for Eleanor.
If we try to string this out

62
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,041
and bring it closer
to viability,

63
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:25,041
it is not just the baby
that could be in trouble, Pete.

64
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:27,542
I mean, you saw the scan.

65
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:31,333
She's got, like, a little
time bomb in her uterus.
Then we should advise them
to terminate and try again.

66
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:34,542
And what are the odds
of that happening?
They could use a surrogate
or adopt.

67
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:37,041
You think somebody's gonna give
a 60-year-old woman a baby?

68
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,417
You think Eleanor's
too old to be a parent?

69
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:41,458
I think it's a little weird

70
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,625
to introduce your prom date
to your 80-year-old mother.

71
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:45,208
That's one of the downsides

72
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,208
of getting good
at fertility treatment.

73
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,208
Everyone thinks they should be
able to have their own baby,

74
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,291
even at 60.
I don't know.

75
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:55,291
Maybe this child
just wasn't meant to be.

76
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,917
Not my b--not our--
not Lucas.

77
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:01,041
A patient.
She's 60 and pregnant.
Oh.

78
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,041
Well, if she's happy sending
her husband out

79
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,500
for dentures and diapers,
then more power to her.

80
00:04:05,542 --> 00:04:07,583
Yeah, well,
the husband's 30.

81
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,083
Even more power to her.

82
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:12,000
Now wait a minute. When Pete
was dating younger woman,

83
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,333
you said it was disgusting.
Don't bring me into this.

84
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:17,333
No, I'm just pointing out that
Violet has a double standard.

85
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:20,542
There is a stigma attached
to dating older women,

86
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:23,709
so I figure if a guy does, he's
in it for the right reasons.

87
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:28,125
Oh, right. Lunch.

88
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:31,750
Uh... Pete, this is
my father, the captain.

89
00:04:31,792 --> 00:04:33,542
Nice to meet you.
Yeah.

90
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:36,000
And, uh, this is, uh...

91
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,333
Oh, hi. Sorry.

92
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:44,041
Not at all.

93
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:47,041
See?
It is disgusting.

94
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,792
Come on, let's go.

95
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:56,083
I almost killed
your child today.
Oh, so today she's my child.

96
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:59,166
No, you would've had to
Bury her body in secret

97
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:02,000
to keep me from going to jail.
Okay, what'd she do?

98
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,041
She tried to
sneak out of the house

99
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:07,041
dressed up like some
25-year-old I don't know what.

100
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,542
You remember when she
used to put on your lipstick--

101
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:13,083
Sam, she's not 4,
and this is not sweet.
Oh, come on now, Nai.

102
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:16,041
Don't "Nai" me. She was trying
to pull one over on me.

103
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,583
And then when I called her
on it, she stomped away

104
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:21,625
and slammed the door,
in my house.
You said you
almost killed her, right?

105
00:05:21,667 --> 00:05:23,625
I am not gonna let
our daughter turn into

106
00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:25,625
one of those snot-nosed
private school kids

107
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:28,625
who just thinks that they can
do whatever they want.
That is not Maya.

108
00:05:28,667 --> 00:05:31,625
Well, apparently,
we don't know Maya.
Well, try not to get
yourself all worked up.

109
00:05:31,667 --> 00:05:33,834
Sam, she is
hiding things from me,

110
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,917
which means
she doesn't trust me

111
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:38,417
or she is doing something
that she knows is wrong.

112
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:40,417
And you think this is
more than her

113
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:43,041
just putting on
some skimpy clothes?
I don't know.

114
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:46,041
I don't know, but I'm gonna
turn her room upside down

115
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:49,792
until I figure out
exactly what's going on.

116
00:05:49,834 --> 00:05:52,166
Well, uh, ruthie looks fine.
How are you doing?

117
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:55,250
Great.
Yeah, you got
these two little ones

118
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:58,041
and 4 others at home
under, what, 8,

119
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:00,959
and you're--
you're great, huh?
I'm very blessed.

120
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,750
Doesn't mean
you can't complain.

121
00:06:02,792 --> 00:06:06,000
Tell me you're exhausted.
Oh, I gave up on sleep
a long time ago.

122
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:08,500
I mean, you got
no time to yourself or...

123
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,208
It's, uh, shimmon.

124
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,166
Yeah, it's your husband?
He's not...

125
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,709
Interested.

126
00:06:20,792 --> 00:06:23,333
Oh, uh, okay.
Well, that, uh, that happens.

127
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,250
Some men feel awkward
with their wives

128
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:28,041
during or sometimes even after
pregnancy, but it passes.

129
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:31,041
Dr. Freedman, I shouldn't be
talking to you about this.

130
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,208
It's not proper.
If there's a problem--

131
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,333
it's not proper, and, uh,
I don't think you can help.

132
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,417
I need your help.

133
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,417
If you knew somebody
was admiring you,

134
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,041
specifically your ass,

135
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:47,041
would that
just be flattering,

136
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,375
or would that
get you aroused?

137
00:06:49,417 --> 00:06:51,000
Who's admiring my ass?

138
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,000
'Cause I think that would be
arousing, right?

139
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:55,000
Yeah.
To know that somebody
right near you

140
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,041
is thinking about you
sexually?

141
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,250
Wait, who are we
talking about, me or you?

142
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,333
W-We're talking about y-you,
right?

143
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,333
You asked me to help you
with something?

144
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,333
Oh, yeah. Um, a patient.

145
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,417
Two months postpartum,
and she's concerned

146
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,750
'cause her husband
is not interested in sex.

147
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:11,750
Oh, well, could be
depression, stress,

148
00:07:11,792 --> 00:07:13,125
performance anxiety.

149
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,041
Unless it's vascular disease,
hyperthyroidism,

150
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,625
iatrogenic impotence.

151
00:07:16,667 --> 00:07:18,834
Forget where
my office is, Coop,

152
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:21,083
the one with
all the marital aids

153
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:24,250
and books you sneak in
to look at during lunch?
No, I was just--

154
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:26,667
referring a patient to Violet
you should be referring to me

155
00:07:26,709 --> 00:07:30,875
because you're still mad
and petty.
Pettiness aside, there's no
reason to jump to physiology.

156
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,917
I mean, sex issues,
more often than not,

157
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,959
are rooted in
emotional dysfunctions.

158
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,166
Yes.
Actually, we're finding
more and more

159
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:41,166
that problems in the bedroom
stem from hormonal imbalances,

160
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:43,458
nerve problems, all kinds
of equipment failure.

161
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,375
Okay, you know what? I would
like to see her alone first.

162
00:07:46,417 --> 00:07:48,667
I thought we were
one big team here at o.W.G.

163
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:51,792
Or is that only when you want in
on other people's patients?

164
00:07:59,792 --> 00:08:01,917
So how exactly
do you see this working?

165
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:04,917
Having an awkward lunch
together every few days

166
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:07,500
that it takes you three
vodka tonics to get through

167
00:08:07,542 --> 00:08:10,542
and me a half a bottle of wine
at night to forget?

168
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,834
Addison, please.

169
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,542
I enjoyed
seeing your office.

170
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,750
Violet's ass
or the whole thing?

171
00:08:18,792 --> 00:08:22,125
I'd like
to see your house.

172
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:25,041
So we could sit there
and stare at each other,

173
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,417
see who blinks first
without even a waiter

174
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,041
to break the tension?

175
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,625
No.

176
00:08:32,542 --> 00:08:34,834
You working on
anything interesting?

177
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,208
I'm just...

178
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,041
I'm trying, Addison.

179
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:47,959
I might be doing an in-utero
intracranial septostomy.

180
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,166
Really?

181
00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:52,667
Trick there is getting
a good angle

182
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:55,000
on the foramen of monro.

183
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,166
Right.

184
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:59,041
And then finding the avascular
plane of the septum.

185
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,583
Yes. Yeah.

186
00:09:04,834 --> 00:09:06,792
So would you go

187
00:09:06,834 --> 00:09:10,917
to the contralateral
ventricle first?

188
00:09:15,917 --> 00:09:19,083
Mom.
What are you doing home?

189
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:29,000
I don't know
who you are...

190
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,208
But you should leave.

191
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,000
Yes, ma'am.

192
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,458
Mom?

193
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,041
Don't...

194
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,917
Talk.

195
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:45,250
One...

196
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:46,375
Two...

197
00:09:46,417 --> 00:09:48,375
Mom, what are you
gonna do?

198
00:09:48,417 --> 00:09:50,417
Three... four...

199
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,458
Mom,
why are you counting?

200
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,750
Five...

201
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:56,041
I am trying
to calm myself down.

202
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,917
Six...

203
00:09:57,959 --> 00:09:59,041
Seven...

204
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:01,041
It's not working.
Mom--

205
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,542
call your father.

206
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:05,500
Tell him to come here now
and save your life.

207
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:12,041
It's not the first time
shimmon hasn't been interested

208
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,750
after we've had a baby, but it's
lasting longer this time.

209
00:10:14,792 --> 00:10:16,667
And I started thinking...

210
00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:19,083
Does your husband f--
how often do you
and your husband...

211
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,375
Okay, well, other than
the lack of interest,

212
00:10:23,417 --> 00:10:26,125
have you noticed anything else
different about your husband?

213
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:28,458
Well, like what?
Is he emotionally distant?

214
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,709
Not at all.
Shimmon's wonderful.

215
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,542
Oh. Oh, good.
Well, have you noticed--

216
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:36,458
any physical changes?
Well, he hasn't been
sleeping well,

217
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,583
so he's always up poking around
the fridge with weird cravings.

218
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:42,250
And, well,
maybe I'm imagining it,

219
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:45,041
but up here...
Getting a little flabby?

220
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,792
It's the couvade.
What's that?

221
00:10:47,834 --> 00:10:49,583
Well, sometimes
a woman's pregnancy

222
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,583
causes changes
in her partner's hormones.

223
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,583
His testosterone gets
converted to estrogen.

224
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:56,166
It's a sympathetic reaction,
so his symptoms mimic yours.

225
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,583
But it's easily treatable--
cognitive behavioral therapy--

226
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,875
androgen supplementation.

227
00:11:00,917 --> 00:11:04,417
Either way, we can help you get
shimmon charged right back up.

228
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm sorry. Maybe I'm not
being clear.

229
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,166
That's not what I want at all.
I love my husband.

230
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:12,166
I love being intimate with him.

231
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,417
But I can't have him
charged back up.

232
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:17,500
I thought you wanted
help with your sex life.

233
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:20,291
We have six kids
who I adore.

234
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,041
But if I have to raise

235
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:25,583
or shimmon has to provide
for any more...

236
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,917
We can't use birth control,

237
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:31,208
but we can't have more kids.

238
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,208
So this couvade,

239
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:37,667
is there any way to
keep it going permanently?

240
00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:39,667
She wants you
to keep him tamed,

241
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:42,125
and you're okay
with that?
Well, people have

242
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,959
meaningful relationships
without having sex.

243
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,959
And yet, when they're not
having it,

244
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,333
it's usually a sign that
there's a problem, isn't it?

245
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,959
You asked me
to help, Cooper.
No, actually,
I asked Violet to help.

246
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,333
And I don't think that what
Rachel needs right now

247
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,333
is for you
to bring her back in

248
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:58,041
and start tossing around words
like "oral" and "anal."
Well, personally,

249
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,041
I don't think Rachel needs
to give up sex at all.

250
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,125
I mean, why should a woman

251
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,375
who's feeling something
not act on it?

252
00:12:04,417 --> 00:12:07,041
No matter how deeply
she tries to Bury her feelings,

253
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:09,166
eventually, they're gonna
come back, right?

254
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:11,792
I think we need to
convince her that it's okay

255
00:12:11,834 --> 00:12:15,041
to use birth control.
Well, I agree, but I don't
think she's going there.

256
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:18,000
I think we're missing
a major part of this equation.

257
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,417
Sex... guy involved.

258
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:23,166
Or at least
there's supposed to be.
You know, he's right.

259
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:26,250
We should get shimmon to help.
But if Rachel
won't talk to a man,

260
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:30,041
would shimmon
talk to a woman?

261
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:34,625
Well, then even if the buildup
of c.S.F. Is significant,

262
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:37,083
you can still get
complete resolution.
Ideally, yes.

263
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,041
Uh...

264
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:41,667
So...
I have a patient,

265
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:44,667
and, um, then I have to go
to the hospital after that.

266
00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:47,667
So thank you for lunch.

267
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:49,458
Okay.

268
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:55,250
Oh, hello.

269
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,667
Dr. Montgomery.

270
00:12:57,709 --> 00:12:59,458
W--captain.

271
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:04,208
Captain.

272
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,041
She was here

273
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:12,875
ditching school
on her back with some boy.
His name is dink.

274
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,875
You told me that you two
were just friends.
Wait a minute. Wait.

275
00:13:15,917 --> 00:13:18,041
What, what, you--
you knew about this dink?

276
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:21,000
Uh, not--not much.
I-I know that she likes him

277
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,000
and that he's in the band.

278
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,667
He's in a band, dad.

279
00:13:24,709 --> 00:13:28,041
You told me
he was in the band.

280
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,959
You two aren't...
Having sex?

281
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,583
No!
So you say. How are we
supposed to trust you, Maya,

282
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:36,583
when you go and you do
something like this

283
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:38,709
and you show
such poor judgment?

284
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,041
So having a boyfriend
counts as poor judgment?
Yes. Did I say you could have
a boyfriend?

285
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,166
Did I say
you could talk to boys?

286
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:47,333
Did I say you could even
be around a boy?
Okay, l--calm down.

287
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:50,041
All right, let's just try
to discuss this rationally.
That's fine with me.

288
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,291
Mom is the one that's
getting all worked up.

289
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,083
Maya.

290
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:57,041
Maybe if you had
a boyfriend...

291
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,834
What? I will--i-i will kill
this child, Sam.
Don't--no, she--

292
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:02,542
you--you better go upstairs
and pack a bag.

293
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:06,000
What?
Go upstairs and pack
a bag... Now.

294
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,542
Okay, don't worry.

295
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,583
All right? I-I got this.

296
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:19,583
Um, I'll bring her over to
my house for a couple of days.

297
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,041
You've been doing all
the parenting. It's my turn.

298
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,000
Thank you.
I-I-I got this.

299
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,125
Yeah,
you better have it, Sam.

300
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:29,542
This is our child.

301
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:32,875
What's bradycardia?
It means that the baby's
heart rate has slowed down.

302
00:14:32,917 --> 00:14:35,000
Nobody said anything
about the heart.

303
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:38,041
It's a side effect
of increased cranial pressure.

304
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:40,125
How dangerous is it?

305
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,500
Your baby isn't going
to make it to viability.

306
00:14:52,542 --> 00:14:55,792
We either need to perform
the septostomy

307
00:14:55,834 --> 00:14:58,417
or terminate the pregnancy.

308
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,875
I'm sorry.

309
00:15:00,917 --> 00:15:03,417
I'm worried about you.

310
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,500
Let's just worry
about the baby.

311
00:15:07,542 --> 00:15:11,166
How soon can you operate?

312
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:16,000

more often.

just take yes as an answer.

Look, I work two jobs
six days a week,

387
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,792

388
00:19:03,834 --> 00:19:05,792

389
00:19:05,834 --> 00:19:08,792
she juggles schools and doctors
and meals and birthdays--

390
00:19:08,834 --> 00:19:11,458
so many things,
I lose track.

391
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,709
Exactly, so at a certain point,
whether it's 7 or 9 or 12 kids,

392
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,041

you'll want to stop?

00:19:54,417 --> 00:19:56,208

405
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:59,208
Look, Addison--
just when you think
you know someone,

406
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,208
they go ahead
and do something nice.
Wait, what?

407
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,041
My father. He wants to
watch me do surgery.

408
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:08,000

00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,834
tennis match--

Hey, Pete.

414
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,792

Nothing is wrong with me.

418
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,709

did something normal.

419
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,583
Congratulations.

420
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:46,041
No, really. I, um...

421
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,625
I slept with someone.

422
00:20:48,667 --> 00:20:51,583
I didn't think I would,
but then I did.

423
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:56,000
And it was... normal. I didn't
even think I cared anymore,

424
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,834
but then I slept with
the captain, and it was

425
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,917
the most normal thing
I've done since the attack.

426
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:03,959
Did I just say his name out
loud? Because I was thinking it,

427
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,125
and then I just--
yeah, I said it out loud.
So all that about
getting your needs met--

428
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,125
no, no, no.
This was not about sex.

429
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:12,041
It was... it was good.

430
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,667
Except for the part

431
00:21:13,709 --> 00:21:16,041
where you committed adultery
with your friend's father.

432
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,000
We need a rabbi.

433
00:21:21,667 --> 00:21:24,625
She's 15 years old, all right?
She's becoming her own person.

434
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:26,417
We gotta give her room.

435
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,417
Room to what,
roll around on the couch

436
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:30,041
with some boy named dink?

437
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,041
Well, maybe we should
meet him, you know,

438
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,709
see what kind of a guy he is.
He's the kind of guy

439
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,375
who had his hands all over
your daughter's--
oh, hey, hey, hey.

440
00:21:37,417 --> 00:21:40,291
Hey, do you remember what you
were like when you were his age?

441
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:43,375
Oh, yeah, well, you're--
you're not a good example,

442
00:21:43,417 --> 00:21:45,041
but this dink person,

443
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:47,041
he looks like a scruffy
little hormone.

444
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:50,000
Okay, I will talk to her
about him.

445
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:51,917
Talking's good,
but yelling's fine, too.

446
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:54,083
She's gotta feel like
she can trust us.

447
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:56,750
She needs to know
that she cannot cross us.

448
00:21:56,792 --> 00:21:58,750
We've gotta
hold the line, Sam.

449
00:21:58,792 --> 00:22:01,041
Tough but fair.

450
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:04,041
All right, well,
when in doubt, you...

451
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,750
Channel me.

452
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:09,542
That's worked out well.

453
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:13,917
You need to talk her
out of it, Dr. Montgomery.

454
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:17,291
I know what we said,
but... when I look at you

455
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,917
and I think about
what they're about to do...

456
00:22:19,959 --> 00:22:21,583
We don't have to do this.

457
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:25,333
If you want to save the baby,
Eleanor has to have surgery.

458
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:28,917
I'm scared, too, Ronnie.

459
00:22:28,959 --> 00:22:30,291
But this our baby.

460
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:33,792
Okay, maybe it's not my egg,
but it's got your d.N.A.

461
00:22:33,834 --> 00:22:36,083
Honey, it's your child.

462
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:38,041
It's not that I don't
love it. I do.

463

I can't even think

466
00:22:45,792 --> 00:22:48,542
But you will.

467
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:50,750
We're never gonna have
the kind of time

468
00:22:50,792 --> 00:22:53,041
that other couples
have together.

469
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:57,125
And after I'm gone,
you're gonna have this...

470
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:59,625
To remember what we had

471
00:22:59,667 --> 00:23:02,542
and what we were together.

472
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:05,041
Look, I get that you want
what's best for Eleanor,

473
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:08,000
but if you do what's best
for the baby,

474
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:10,834
I think I can give you both.

475
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:14,166
Ronnie, please.

476
00:23:16,709 --> 00:23:19,166
Okay.

477
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:20,792
Okay.

478
00:23:29,667 --> 00:23:33,166
Violet slept
with Addison's father.

479
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:36,000
She...

480
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:38,083
I thought you'd want to know.

481
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,083
Why would she do that?

482
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:41,709
Why would she tell you?

483
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,709
Some people can talk to me.

484
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,083
Oh.

485
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:50,083
I'm trying to tell you things,
like you wanted.

486
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:52,625
Gossiping about
who's sleeping with whom

487
00:23:52,667 --> 00:23:55,417
is not want I wanted.

488
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:58,625
Where are we, Cooper,

489
00:23:58,667 --> 00:24:00,792
you and me?

490
00:24:02,667 --> 00:24:05,083
I don't know.

491
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,750
Okay, hold on, baby.

492
00:24:13,792 --> 00:24:15,542
Sit still.

493
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:18,375
I wish she could give
the baby a paralytic

494
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:20,000
to slow everything down.

495
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,000
Can't because of
Eleanor's age.

496
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:23,792
Well, you could. I would.

497
00:24:23,834 --> 00:24:26,959
I've learned...
Don't second guess her.

498
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,959
Well, I-I didn't mean to,
but that's nice.

499
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,333
You're--
you're being protective.

500
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:34,000
I can only imagine
what she's said about me.

501
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:35,375
She hasn't,

502
00:24:35,417 --> 00:24:38,000
not much anyway.

503
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:40,250
Are you two... close?

504
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:42,709
We are.

505
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,959
Um, not like that.
I'm with Violet.

506
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,250
Well, I was with vi--
well...

507
00:24:47,291 --> 00:24:50,375
We recently had a baby
together, so we're...

508
00:24:50,417 --> 00:24:53,208
Well, I don't know
what we are.

509
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:56,125
Well...
Okay, I'm in at...

510
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:58,583
2 millimeters.

511
00:24:58,625 --> 00:25:01,000
Get ready to inflate.

512
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:05,208
Okay, go.

513
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:07,208
You ever seen Addison

514
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,041
do surgery before?

515
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:11,500
Not since she was a kid.

516
00:25:11,542 --> 00:25:13,917
Uh, when she was 8 or 9,

517
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:16,834
she used to love to come to
the university with me.

518
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:19,917
She'd sit in the back of
my class cutting on a hot dog

519
00:25:19,959 --> 00:25:23,208
while my other students
worked on their cadavers.

520
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:26,667
She always wanted
to impress me.
With a hot dog?

521
00:25:26,709 --> 00:25:29,417
You ever try to take
the casing off in one piece?

522
00:25:29,458 --> 00:25:31,333
It's like separating

523
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:34,041
the dura
from the cerebral cortex.

524
00:25:34,083 --> 00:25:35,667
She's gotten good at it,

525
00:25:35,709 --> 00:25:38,000
clearly.

526
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:40,041
Damn it.

527
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:43,000
The opening's closing up.

528
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:46,375
Stay and visualize...
Then reinflate.

529
00:25:46,417 --> 00:25:48,166
Come on, Addie.

530
00:25:48,208 --> 00:25:50,667
She will.

531
00:25:50,709 --> 00:25:54,417
Okay, repositioning.

532
00:25:54,458 --> 00:25:56,083
Come on.

533
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:02,291
Okay. We're back in
at the original incision.

534
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:05,041
Inflate the balloon
to 3 millimeters...

535
00:26:05,083 --> 00:26:07,000
Now.

536
00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:08,792
Come on.

537
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:10,000
Hold.

538
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:13,041
Hold.

539
00:26:13,083 --> 00:26:15,083
Good.

540
00:26:15,125 --> 00:26:17,417
Got it. Camera.

541
00:26:17,458 --> 00:26:20,041
She's got it.

542
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:22,000
She's good.

543
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:24,834
Okay, let's prepare to close.

544
00:26:27,625 --> 00:26:30,041
It's a mitzvah, guys.

545
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:32,959
Married people
are supposed to be having sex.

546
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,959
Whether or not
they're trying to have kids?

547
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,625
Absolutely. Judaism is unique
among the major world religions

548
00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:40,125
in that it promotes sex
not just for procreation

549
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:41,959
but for pleasure.

550
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,834
You see? You should come
to shul more often.

551
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:47,041
You'd learn
all sorts of good things.

552
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:49,208
That's good. Sex is good.

553
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:52,083
But even if people are just
having sex for pleasure,

554
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:55,333
babies happen.
And you want to know
about birth control.

555
00:26:55,375 --> 00:26:57,959
You should read
the story of onan.

556
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,041
We're pretty down on anything
that has to do with

557
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:02,709
destruction of the seed.
Well, the pill doesn't
technically destroy any seed.

558
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:05,875
You're right. It--it's all
about interpretation.

559
00:27:05,917 --> 00:27:08,166
Depending upon how observant
they are, some Jews feel

560
00:27:08,208 --> 00:27:11,166
that if you've had
at least one boy and one girl,

561
00:27:11,208 --> 00:27:12,792
you've been fruitful enough.

562
00:27:12,834 --> 00:27:14,458
Others take a harder line.

563
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,041
So with the hard-liners,
is there any kind of loophole?

564
00:27:17,083 --> 00:27:19,166
Isn't there a mercy clause
in judaism

filled up the minivan

but still want to keep doing
those--those mitzvahs?

567

Look, rabbis have been
debating these rules

568

00:32:46,083 --> 00:32:49,083
I think it was--i think
it was really good for me.
That's good.

683
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:52,041
Good for you. But, you know,
telling people things,

684
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:54,083
telling the truth,
it's important.

685
00:32:54,125 --> 00:32:55,917
And that's a lesson

686
00:32:55,959 --> 00:32:57,917
that the women
in this room could learn.

687
00:32:57,959 --> 00:33:00,417
Are you done
with your lecture?

688
00:33:00,458 --> 00:33:03,333
'Cause it's not getting us
anywhere with the golds.
Yeah, it really
should not be this hard.

689
00:33:03,375 --> 00:33:06,041
Well, it's not. It's the one
time we have a magic pill.

690
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:08,792
Doesn't take a genius to pop
one of these every morning.

691
00:33:08,834 --> 00:33:11,291
Salt, water, little bit
of estrogen--

692
00:33:11,333 --> 00:33:14,125
if it didn't say "birth control"
on the side,

693
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:17,083
the golds would be fine
with it.

694
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:21,000
I think we should ask them
to come back in.

695
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:26,834
Ronnie.

696
00:33:26,875 --> 00:33:28,208
You're okay, El.

697
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:29,417
Oh.

698
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:32,208
You're okay.

699
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,208
Would you like
to see your baby?

700
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:36,000
Yeah.

701
00:33:37,834 --> 00:33:40,041
The head...

702
00:33:40,083 --> 00:33:42,083
It's perfect.

703
00:33:43,667 --> 00:33:47,417
I can't believe I almost...

704
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:49,667
I almost took this
away from us.
But you didn't.

705
00:33:49,709 --> 00:33:52,875
When things got hard,
you acted like a father.

706
00:33:56,709 --> 00:33:59,250
Addison?
I gotta go.

707
00:33:59,291 --> 00:34:01,041
Excuse me.

708
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:04,041
Addison, hey.

709
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:06,041
You want to talk about it?

710
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:07,875
No.

711
00:34:07,917 --> 00:34:10,417
Yes and no.

712
00:34:12,709 --> 00:34:16,000
My father
slept with Violet.

713
00:34:17,709 --> 00:34:19,250

00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:53,458
Hi, Dr. Bennett.
I'm dink--

00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,041
I know who you are.
You said you wanted
to meet him.

Get out of my house.

729
00:34:58,667 --> 00:35:01,041
Go upstairs and put on
some clothes.
Daddy--

730
00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:04,041
get your behind upstairs.

731
00:35:04,083 --> 00:35:06,500
Okay, everybody, this party's
over. Don't bother cleaning up.

00:35:06,542 --> 00:35:09,041

No.

738
00:35:47,166 --> 00:35:50,291
I think things happen
for a reason, Pete.

739
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:52,959
And sometimes
you don't see them coming.

740
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,333
Sometimes you don't think
they could come.

741
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:58,000
But they do.

742
00:35:58,041 --> 00:36:01,458
And I hope you're not upset,
because...

743
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,208
I'm not ashamed.

744
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:05,417
I'm hopeful, actually, and--

745
00:36:05,458 --> 00:36:07,709
stop talking, Violet.

746
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:10,792
You're talking as if I care,
as if it concerns me.

747
00:36:10,834 --> 00:36:13,041
But what you do--
I don't care anymore.

748
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:15,208
I'm done.

749
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:26,834
We have all sorts of ways to
help you--devices, counseling--

750
00:36:26,875 --> 00:36:29,542
if and when you decide
to avail yourselves of it.

751
00:36:29,583 --> 00:36:32,542
But ultimately, this isn't
a medical decision.

752
00:36:32,583 --> 00:36:35,792
It's a personal one.

753
00:36:35,834 --> 00:36:38,834
So that's it?

754
00:36:40,291 --> 00:36:42,583
Shayna.

755
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:50,041
Uh, Rachel.

756
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:53,959
Um, so Dr. Freedman told me
how exhausted you are.

757
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,041
I'll be okay.

758
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:57,959
Well, you're probably
just anemic.

759
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,959
It's very common
in young mothers.

760
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,333
Uh, this should help.
Is that...

761
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:05,041
Among other things, it treats
iron deficient anemia.

762
00:37:05,083 --> 00:37:08,041
So if you feel like
you need it,

763
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:10,959
that would be up to you.

764
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:35,834
Okay, guys. Let's go.
Are we ready?

765
00:37:35,875 --> 00:37:39,417
Come on.
Come on, come on.

766
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:41,542
Bye.
Bye.

767
00:37:45,458 --> 00:37:48,667
Sometimes you don't tell
the person you love something

768
00:37:48,709 --> 00:37:50,709
to protect 'em.

769
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:56,750
I have a question for you.

770
00:37:56,792 --> 00:37:58,750
When you
slept with my father,

771
00:37:58,792 --> 00:38:00,834
when you helped him
cheat on my mother,

772
00:38:00,875 --> 00:38:03,125
uh, what did you say to him
to make him

773
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:06,500
behave actually like
a human being?
Addison, he is a human being.

774
00:38:06,542 --> 00:38:10,667
Are you that gullible, lonely?
Is that it? What is it?
It wasn't like that.

775
00:38:10,709 --> 00:38:12,875
So then what was it like?
Tell me, because of

776
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:16,041
all the faceless, nameless women
he's rolled around with,

777
00:38:16,083 --> 00:38:19,000
you're the first one
I can actually ask.

778
00:38:19,041 --> 00:38:22,000
Okay, um, if you--
if you really want to know,

779
00:38:22,041 --> 00:38:25,458
it was, um...
It was wonderful.

780
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,458
No, i'm--I'm sorry
if--if that hurts you

781
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,667
or if it doesn't jibe
with how you see him,

782
00:38:29,709 --> 00:38:31,333
but he was kind and caring.

783
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:34,041
He was a real gentleman.
He helped me.

784
00:38:34,083 --> 00:38:36,542
He's the first person
in a long time

785
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:38,500
that made me feel normal.

786
00:38:38,542 --> 00:38:42,041
And maybe I was wrong for
doing it, maybe we both were,

787
00:38:42,083 --> 00:38:44,041
but he's not a bad person.

788
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:47,000
And I didn't mean
to hurt you, Addison--
well, but you did it anyway.

789
00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:49,417
Well, you told Pete.
Did you mean to hurt him?

790
00:38:49,458 --> 00:38:51,041
That's different.

791
00:38:51,083 --> 00:38:53,625
But you did it anyway.

792
00:38:57,125 --> 00:38:59,500
Get out.
But, daddy, I don't think--

793
00:38:59,542 --> 00:39:02,166
get out of this car,
go in the house

794
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:06,000
apologize to your mother
and mean it,

795
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:09,041
