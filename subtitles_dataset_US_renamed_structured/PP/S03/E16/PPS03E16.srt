You left your panties
at my house this morning.

00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:28,417
I was looking for these.

Violet.

10

She's been gone two weeks.
I killed all her houseplants.

Awfully into Violet.

No, she's not.

15
00:00:45,834 --> 00:00:47,834
It's just that Cooper's
on vacation with Violet.

16
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:51,667
And she can't admit
that she misses Cooper, so...

What are you doing?

18
00:00:53,542 --> 00:00:56,041
I'm waiting for Sam.
I'm gonna make him talk to me.

19
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:58,500
Make him?
Mm-hmm. For the past
couple of weeks,

20
00:00:58,542 --> 00:01:00,500
he's been avoiding
the office altogether,

21
00:01:00,542 --> 00:01:02,041
booking surgery after surgery.

22
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:04,041
Well... today we have
a patient together,

23
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:07,041
and he is
going to talk to me.
I know you don't want to hear me
say this again, but--

24
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:10,709
no, he has no right
to be mad at me, Pete.
He has a right to be mad.

25
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,917
You told him
you couldn't be with him

26
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:15,458
and you started sleeping
with me.
But you are not the ex-husband
of my best friend.

27
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,792
Look, you know,
it irritates me.

28
00:01:17,834 --> 00:01:20,917
I mean, doesn't it irritate you
that Violet went away?

29
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:22,917
She's not with some guy.
She's with, uh, Cooper,

and they--they're touching
monkeys, whatever they call it.

73
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:25,250
I can't do this. I can't.
You can. You can.
Just try and ground yourself.

107
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,792

111
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,458

Elvis?

118
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:34,500
Right.

119
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:37,500

you that physical soon enough.

120
00:05:37,542 --> 00:05:39,083
Did you bring the form?

121
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:42,041
Yes, I got it right here.
Excellent.

122

Yeah.

125
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:54,291

Could deliver at any time.

126
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,417
Has there been
any change with his heart?

127
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:59,750
Well, the doppler shows
no change in the anatomy.

128
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:03,125
There's transposition
of the great vessels.
You'll schedule
the heart surgery?

129
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:06,250
How soon?
Well, I'll do the first one
within a week of delivery.

130
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:09,458
And then we can figure out
the rest of the schedule

131
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,667
as the baby grows.

132
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:20,667
Let's just hope
the baby has your lungs, yeah?

133
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:23,125
Yeah.
All right, let's get you
into that physical,

134
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:26,333
check out that cough.

135
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,458

Not quite

138
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:36,208
What are you doing in here?
I'm updating the notes
on one of Violet's patients.

139
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,041
Plane crash survivor getting
over her fear of flying...

140
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,792
Until she had a meltdown

141
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:42,709
and was completely
re-traumatized under my care.

142
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,792
Like house-sitting for a friend
and killing their dog?

143
00:06:45,834 --> 00:06:49,291
Thank you. That--
that makes me feel better.
She's not back yet.

144
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,041
Who does that?

145
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,291
Drops everything on a moment's
notice and disappears?

146
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,166
We're really
talking about Cooper.

147
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,041
No.

148
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,250
I was under the impression
that you'd broken up.
We have.

149
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:02,208
We were doing just fine
hating each other

150
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,041
till Maya's wedding.

151
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,959
He followed me
into the bathroom.

152
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,667
Long story.

153
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:09,667
Well, maybe after
the long story,

154
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:12,208
Cooper's just trying
to figure things out.

155
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,250
Maybe he's just an ass.

156
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:19,041
So... this is the guy.

157
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:22,834
I'm the guy.
You know, I'd given up
on meeting someone.

158
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,834
That's why we harvested my eggs,
but then... Bam.

159
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,208

160
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,417
bursting through
the winter snow--

161
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:32,250
- outta nowhere.
- Henry sells rare Peruvian Lily seedlings online.

162
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:35,208
That's how we met.
Oh.

163
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,667
I googled all around,
but he was the only one

164
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:40,542
that would
ship them overnight.
Not many people understand
the differences in lilies.

165
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:43,041
Not the way may does.
It's fate.
We're like Henry and June.

166
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:44,667
But one month off.

167
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:46,041
Oh, ow.

168
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,291
Don't make me laugh.
It hurts when I laugh.

169
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:51,291
Okay, what hurts?
He flew all the way over here
to meet me,

170
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:54,041
so we could see
if we both lived up

171
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:57,500
to the e-mails and the pictures
and the phone calls.

172
00:07:57,542 --> 00:08:00,166
And we did. You did, Henry.

173
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:03,083
I thought I was
being gentle, but--
last night
was our first time.

174
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:06,041
Mm-hmm.
I have never had
so much pain.

175
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:09,709
I feel like i'm...
On fire.

176
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,208
Okay. All right. Okay. Well,
we will--we will take a look.

177
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,917
And, uh, we'll get you back
on your feet, so to speak.
Okay.

178
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,917
Hey.

179
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:20,291
Hey.

180
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,750
So, um...

181
00:08:22,792 --> 00:08:24,709
We're good?

182
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,917
Yeah, we are good.
No, no, no. I mean
about me and Pete.

183
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,917
Yeah, yeah.
I know what you mean.

184
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:33,041
Be-because I want to make sure
you know that it's different.

185
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,041
Me and Pete is different
than me and you

186
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,333
because you were married
to Naomi,

187
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:40,417
and she's my best friend.
Addison, I don't have to
talk about this.

188
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,083
It's water under the bridge.

189
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:44,375
Pete, glad you're here.
Take a look at this?

190
00:08:44,417 --> 00:08:46,667
Esau's got an infiltrate
on his lung

191
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:48,041
and a pleural effusion.

192
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:50,041
I think I'm gonna need
a consult.

193
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,667
You needed a consult
and you called Pete?

194
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:54,041
He did... call me.

195
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,041
All right, people, I'm good.
All right?

196
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,000
I don't think this is.

197
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:03,458
Right there.

198
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,000
What's going on?
This is Dr. Wilder.

199
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,625
He's a specialist
in infectious diseases.

200
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:10,375
I'd like you both
to put these on, please.
Elisha, if you could just come
over to this side of the room,

201
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:13,041
just for a moment.
You're scaring me.
What's wrong?

202
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:17,458
Esau has tuberculosis.
What? No, no, no. Other than
the cough, I-I feel fine.

203
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,667
I feel fine.
T.B. Doesn't always manifest
with anything more than a cough.

204
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:23,834
But it's serious.
No one gets t.B. Anymore.

205
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,834
Not here much,
but it's on the rise

206
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:28,041
in other parts of the world.
What--what about Elisha
and the baby?

207
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:30,041
What if they get it?
We can test her.

208
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:33,041
If she's positive,
we can go ahead and treat her.
The mask should protect her,

209
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:35,041
but in the meantime,
I'd like Sam

210
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:37,291
to check you into St. ambrose,
run some tests,

211
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,417
find out what strain you have

212
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:42,417
and get you started
on antibiotics.
Wait, i--if immigration
finds out I have t.B.,

213
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,041
what about my green card?

214
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,041
I need you to sign off on
my physical, to say I'm okay.
Esau...

215
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:50,250
No, his visa's expired.

216
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:53,083
If you don't send that form in,
they'll send him away.

217
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,959
Dr. Bennett, please.

218
00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:09,041
Okay. So the nurses
are finishing up on him.

219
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,041
Uh, then you can go in.

220
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,750
I put him on antibiotics

221
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:15,333
and took some cultures
to verify the strain.

222
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,041
And what about the form,
Dr. Bennett?

223
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,875
I have a legal obligation
to turn that form in,

224
00:10:20,917 --> 00:10:23,709
and I-I can't lie on it.
But he's gonna get deported.
We're supposed to be married.

225
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,709
I'm gonna have his baby
in a few weeks.

226
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,709
Can you hold off
on sending the form in?
I don't feel comfortable

227
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,000
withholding information
from the government.

228
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:34,000
If he doesn't have that form,
he's illegal and he can't work

229
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:36,041
and he could be deported
at any time.

230
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:39,041
I...

231
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:42,375
Okay, okay, um...

232
00:10:42,417 --> 00:10:46,125
W-We'll just go live
with his--his parents in Kenya.

233
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,041
Elisha, uh...

234
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,291
You can't leave the country.

235
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:53,667
If he's going,
I'm going with him.
He's talking about the baby.

236
00:10:53,709 --> 00:10:55,041
He needs surgeries

237
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,375
and extensive care
for the next few years.

238
00:10:57,417 --> 00:11:00,959
You won't have access to
the care that he needs in Kenya.

239
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,375
Oh.

240
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,583
I'll hold off
on--on sending in the forms.

241
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,792
We'll get him treated

242
00:11:10,834 --> 00:11:13,959
and we'll worry
about immigration later.
Thank you.

243
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Thank you.
Okay.

244
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:18,041
Okay.
Okay.

245
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:25,625
Thank you, Sam.
Yeah.

246
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,959
Hey, you.

247
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:31,000
I thought you were
at your office today.

248
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,542
Oh, hey. No, change of plans.
Oh.

249
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:37,792
Uh, uh, Vanessa hoyt,
this is Addison Montgomery.

250
00:11:37,834 --> 00:11:40,667
Vanessa hoyt
the, uh, perinatologist?

251
00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:42,041
And neonatologist.

252
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,583
I've heard a lot
about you, too. Good things.
From Sam?

253
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:48,041
Um, no. I didn't realize
the two of you knew each other.

254
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,792
I-I didn't realize you two
knew each other either. Yeah.

255
00:11:50,834 --> 00:11:53,166
Well, Sam asked me to consult
on a case last week,

256
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:56,000
and we just hit it off.

257
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,583
Well, that's nice...

258
00:11:57,625 --> 00:12:00,041
That he asked you to consult
on a case...

259
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,417
Yeah.

260
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:05,041
Involving a pregnant patient
from his practice.

261
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:08,625
So I have a minute
if you want to grab coffee?

262
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:12,041
Sure, sure. Let's go.
Okay. Nice to meet you.

263
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,041
Okay.

264
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,667
Hey.

265
00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:16,875
Hi.

266
00:12:16,917 --> 00:12:18,875
Thanks for fitting this
into your day.

267
00:12:18,917 --> 00:12:20,834
I thought may was having
an allergic reaction,

268
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:23,625
but I-I just can't
pin it down.
No worries.

269
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,041
Mm.

270
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:31,792
You seem... more relaxed
than I've seen you in a while.

271
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:35,208
Well, that's William.
Ah, love.

272
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,709
No, not--not love.

273
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,625
Well, maybe eventually love.

274
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:43,041
No, he's wooing me.

275
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,834
Well, I gotta hand it
to the guy. He's got class.

276
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:48,041
And it's good
to see you looking so happy.

277
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:52,417
You and Addison...

278
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:55,041
I didn't think
anybody knew about that.

279
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:58,208
Yeah, well, Addison told me.
What about you and Violet?

280
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,041
Violet's on vacation.
Well, don't you think
that could be good for Violet,

281
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:04,041
getting away from it all?
She's spent the last nine months
away from it all.

282
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,834
Oh.

283
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,709
Oh.

284
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,083
What is it?

285
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,333
The tests from your exam

286
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,667
show that you had
an allergic reaction.

287
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:18,083
And that's why I brought in
Dr. Wilder.
So what's she allergic to?

288
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:20,125
She's allergic
to your sperm.

289
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,125
My sperm?

290
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,792
Yes, it's a rare reaction
to a protein in the fluid.

291
00:13:24,834 --> 00:13:26,792
Which can lead to
an anaphylactic reaction

292
00:13:26,834 --> 00:13:29,041
the next time
she's exposed.

293
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,041
It's sort of like
a peanut allergy.

294
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,041
Once you have it,
the next time's usually worse.

295
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:35,709
But you can fix it, right?

296
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,083
Well... This type
of allergy is complicated.

297
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,083
I'm looking into
possible treatments,

298
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:43,667
but right now...
No, I can't.

299
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:46,333
We can't be allergic
to each other.

300
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:49,500
A-And what about kids? We both
want to have kids someday.

301
00:13:49,542 --> 00:13:52,500
And if I'm allergic
to his sperm--
that's--that's where
we can help.

302
00:13:52,542 --> 00:13:54,792
We can wash the sperm
and inseminate.

303
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,333
And if that doesn't solve
the problem,

304
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:00,041
then we can do in vitro
with your eggs.

305
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,625
So, uh, a baby someday.

306
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:07,041
But--but we can't be, um...
Intimate?

307
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:09,750
Y-Yes, you can be,
just safely.

308
00:14:09,792 --> 00:14:12,208
You need to make sure
you use a condom

309
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,583
until Dr. Wilder
can figure this out.

310
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:18,208
I just wanted everything
to be perfect.

311
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,041
Thank you.

312
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,834
Buenos dias!

313
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:28,583
Well, look who forgot
the s.P.F.

314
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:31,792
This is for you.

315
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,583
Costa Rica--
best coffee in the world.

316
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,583
I thought you were
touching monkeys.
That was the plan,

317
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,583
and then we went
to the airport,

318
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:44,000
and we said, "no plans--
Costa Rica."

319
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,041
White sand beaches,
fabulous music,

320
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,417
a steady stream of alcohol...

321
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:50,333
It was very zen.

322
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,834
Did you just say "zen"
to me?
It was relaxing, Charlotte.

323
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:56,834
Did you go to Central America
or did you join a cult?

324
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,375
Coop, you're back.

325
00:14:58,417 --> 00:15:00,709
Pete!

326
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,166
He's zen.

327
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:06,000
Mm. Best coffee
in the world. Mm-hmm.

328
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,917
Um, I actually came
to borrow a book from you.

329
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,291
Semen allergies.
I'll see what I have.

330
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,375
So... what about Violet?

331
00:15:13,417 --> 00:15:15,000
Is she zen, too?

332
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,375
Oh, Violet. Violet, uh,
she didn't come back.

333
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:20,041
She decided to stay.

334
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:24,208
She decided to stay?

335
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,917
I-I... she won't see her kid,
she won't get help,

336
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,083
and suddenly
she's a Costa Rican woman.

337
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,542
Ooh. Light just went on

my wine.
Addison--

340
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,959
oh, come on. He's dating
a neonatal specialist, Pete.

341
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,959

Hey, Sam.
Addison, what, uh--

377
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,375
uh, esau's tests came back.
It's m.D.R.

00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:40,041
I was wondering if you had
a number for Violet.

392
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,875
One of her patients--i need
to get her on a plane.

393
00:17:42,917 --> 00:17:45,834
I mean, Violet's patient,
not Violet.
No, sorry. She's trekking
in the rain forest,

394
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,834
next couple of weeks.

395
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:50,709

good or is she running away?

00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,917
No, no, no. It's good.
It's therapeutic.

397
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:55,041
Well,
I'm all for therapeutic--

398
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,792
and you covering her patients
has been very helpful.

399
00:17:57,834 --> 00:18:01,041
She doesn't have to worry
about them. She knows they're--
well, great, great.
No pressure there.

00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,041
Sorry. It's just, uh,
as I said,

401
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,041
there's one
I'm struggling with.

402
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,875
Mm-hmm.

403
00:18:06,917 --> 00:18:09,417
Well, day after day,

404
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:13,625
the sun... you know?

405
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:15,750
It's zen.

406
00:18:15,792 --> 00:18:19,125
Oh, I found zen... once.

407
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:22,458
It was the best couple hours
of my life.

408
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,041
How long does he have to be
in quarantine?

409
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,458
Up to six months.
We can't risk an outbreak.

410
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,458
They're gonna be devastated.

411
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,000
Always fun
to break people's hearts.

412
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,875
He's gone.

413
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:41,583
They're gone.

414
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,166
So I'm just gonna
drive up tomorrow.

415
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,792
I don't need to fly.

416
00:18:48,834 --> 00:18:51,792
I can have a good life
without ever leaving the ground.

417
00:18:51,834 --> 00:18:53,792
You wanted this, Natasha.

418
00:18:53,834 --> 00:18:55,542
What's the point?

419
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,542
We've been over the crash
a hundred times.

420
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:00,417
Then let's not talk
about the crash.

421
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,583
Let's talk about yesterday.
Okay? Talk me through it.

422
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:05,583
We'll see if we can figure out
what triggered you. Okay?

423
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,375
Okay.

424
00:19:07,417 --> 00:19:10,792
Um...

425
00:19:10,834 --> 00:19:13,000
We sat down.

426
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:15,375
And... then
the announcement came on,

427
00:19:15,417 --> 00:19:19,125
talking about
the emergency procedures.

428
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:22,417
And I was still okay.

429
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:25,041
Then what happened?

430
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:28,333
I mean, what started you
feeling anxious?

431
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,041
I don't know.

432
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:32,959
I just freaked out.

433
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,041
Think about what you were
thinking before that happened.

434
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:40,333
You know, you talked about
your sister and the wedding...

435
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,333
Natasha?

436
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,208
What happened?

437
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,834
It was you.

438
00:19:55,875 --> 00:20:00,208
You touched my arm
and told me to breathe

439
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,041
just like she did.

440
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,041
Like Violet?

441
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:08,083
No, the woman who sat
next to me in the crash.

442
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:13,375
The woman I killed.

443
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,000
Any luck in finding them?

444
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,000
I've called everyone
in Elisha's file.

445
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:28,417
No one's heard from them--
the grad school, nothing.

446
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:32,208
And esau
has no family here, so...
They could be anywhere,
infecting anyone.

447
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,834
We should've talked to Elisha
more after we told her

448
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:38,208
she couldn't take her baby
out of the country.
You're saying I scared her?

449
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,166
No, that's not
what I said, Sam.
All right.
Well, I'm calling immigration.

450
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:45,041
No, Sam. That is not our job.
We're not the police.
Leaving isolation
at the hospital

451
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:49,041
was irresponsible.
They're not going to knowingly
put anyone at risk.

452
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:52,083
Let me try
and find them, okay?
Now you're being irresponsible.

453
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,083
Oh, really?
I'm being irresponsible?

454
00:20:55,417 --> 00:20:58,041
What is that
supposed to mean?

455
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,917
Oh, this is about Vanessa.

456
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:01,375
She works on babies, Sam.

457
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:04,041
You're dating someone
you think will get to me.

458
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:06,500
All right, you're jealous.
And you know what?

459
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:11,041
You don't get to be jealous
because you made your choice.

460
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:13,333
Sam, don't call, okay?

461
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,625
Look, they're scared.
They're in trouble.

462
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:20,375
The last thing they need is
immigration coming down on them.

463
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,959
I looked out
and...

464
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,542
I saw the wing hit the ground.

465
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,917
And there was...

466
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:32,458
There was smoke...

467
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,542
And then fire...

468
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:39,166
And screaming.

469
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,166
I unbuckled my seat belt.

470
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:43,792
But the woman next to me,
she...

471
00:21:43,834 --> 00:21:46,000
She couldn't
get her belt undone.

472
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:49,750
And... she was screaming,

473
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:54,375
"help me. Please help me."

474
00:21:54,417 --> 00:21:57,333
But I just wanted to get out.

475
00:21:57,375 --> 00:22:00,250
I was so scared.

476
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:04,291
And I looked at her,
and she was scared.

477
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:06,959
But I ran.

478
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:10,041
I could hear her screaming,
and...

479
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:12,542
And I just ran away.

480
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:15,542
You didn't kill her.
The crash did.

481
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:19,041
If you had stayed,
you would've died, too.
I could've done more.

482
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:22,500
I was awful.
I killed that woman.

483
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:25,500
I can't
talk my way out of that.

484
00:22:25,542 --> 00:22:28,709
I can't breathe my way
past it.

485
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,000
Natasha--

486
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:33,458
no. Tell Violet
I'm done with therapy. I quit.

487
00:22:37,792 --> 00:22:39,750
I'm only saying,

488
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:42,166
if we can block the formation
of cicatricial tissue--

489
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:44,166
the neurons are spared
permanent damage,

490
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:46,667
and people like me
would be able to walk

491
00:22:46,709 --> 00:22:49,542
no matter how bad
the injury they sustained?

492
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:53,041
I read last month's
"new england journal," too.

493
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:57,125
I'll leave you to it.

494
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:58,375
Fife.

495
00:22:58,417 --> 00:23:00,333
I don't like
being patronized.

496
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:02,041
Even by our patron?

497
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:04,417
What do you
have against him?

498
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:06,417
Hey! What?

499
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:09,458
William white doesn't know you.
He just likes the idea of you.

500
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,625
You'd be like
a trophy in his case.

501
00:23:11,667 --> 00:23:14,041
That's what you'd do for him.

502
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:15,500
But since I read once,

503
00:23:15,542 --> 00:23:18,083
when you're fighting
for a girl you love,

504
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:20,417
you shouldn't put down
the competition

505
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:22,417
because it makes you
look insecure,

506
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:24,417
I'll bring it back to me.

507
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:26,875
Um... I know I'm abrasive.

508
00:23:26,917 --> 00:23:30,250
I know I'm snide.

509
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:32,583
But...

510
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:34,709
You make me a better person.

511
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:40,834
That's what you do...
For me.

512
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:57,709
You gonna eat it
or make love to it?

513
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,083
Bananas are amazing.

514
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:02,083
I will never look at one
the same way again.

515
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:06,041
Here. You can have this one.
I'll find another.

516
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:09,709
- Ooh! What's your problem?
- Cut the zen crap, Cooper.

517
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:13,709
You follow me into the bathroom
and then take off for two weeks.
I know. It was a mistake,
which is why I left.

518
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,917
But I'm not angry anymore.
Well, I am.

519
00:24:16,959 --> 00:24:19,291
The sex didn't have to mean
we were a happy couple again,

520
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:22,041
but it had to mean something.
It did.
It meant I was still angry.

521
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:24,500
I've been sitting on a beach
with a therapist

522
00:24:24,542 --> 00:24:26,083
working this out.

523
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:29,333
That moment has passed.
We can move on with our lives.

524
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:31,458
I forgive you.
You forgive me?

525
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,792
Yes. Ow! Ow!

526
00:24:35,834 --> 00:24:37,792
You need
to talk to somebody

527
00:24:37,834 --> 00:24:39,667
about your eating disorder.

528
00:24:39,709 --> 00:24:41,250
Shut up.

529
00:24:41,291 --> 00:24:43,041
Fife's in love with me.

530
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:45,041
Really?

531
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:47,375
Mm-hmm.
You're sure?

532
00:24:47,417 --> 00:24:49,875
Yeah, because he told me so.

533
00:24:49,917 --> 00:24:52,458
He said
I make him a better person.

534
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,041
Damn it.

535
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:56,041
Yeah.

536
00:24:56,083 --> 00:24:59,041
Jeez. How do you turn down
the guy in the wheelchair?

537
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:01,083
What? Oh, god. I don't--

538
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,041
I don't even notice
the wheelchair anymore.

539
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:06,041
I mean, but--but who...
Who does he think he is?

540
00:25:06,083 --> 00:25:09,000
How does get off loving me?
I mean, he is mean.

541
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:12,041
He is mean and he is sarcastic
and he's morally adrift.

542
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:14,041
He'd steal my d.N.A.
And clone me

543
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:16,041
if he could get away with it.

544
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:18,041
He--he is everything
that I hate.

545
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,792
No, he's not--he's not allowed
to--he's not allowed to love me.

546
00:25:20,834 --> 00:25:22,041
Oh.

547
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:24,291
What?

548
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:25,959
You like him.

549
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,834
No. I am dating William.

550
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:32,041
You like him a lot.

551
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:34,250
Oh, my god.

552
00:25:34,291 --> 00:25:36,041
I like him a lot.

553
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:39,041
Yes.

554
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:41,375
Uh, she can't breathe.

555
00:25:41,417 --> 00:25:43,792
She--she threw up, and, uh,
she started sweating.

556
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:46,792
Slow down.
Tell me what happened.
Uh, we used a condom.
I don't know.

557
00:25:46,834 --> 00:25:48,792
We thought we were being safe.

558
00:25:48,834 --> 00:25:51,333
- She almost stopped breathing in the ambulance.
- Epi's on board,

559
00:25:51,375 --> 00:25:53,792
but her pulse ox is dropping.

560
00:25:53,834 --> 00:25:55,792
I'm gonna intubate.
I can't believe...

561
00:25:55,834 --> 00:25:57,750
Don't talk. I need to listen.
Prep the tube,

562
00:25:57,792 --> 00:25:59,834
but give me one minute.
She may not have a minute.

563
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:02,667
May, I know you're scared...
Dr. Wilder!

564
00:26:02,709 --> 00:26:04,667
But it's making
your breathing worse.

565
00:26:04,709 --> 00:26:06,875
I need you to take
slow, deep breaths.

566
00:26:06,917 --> 00:26:10,041
Henry, come take her hand.
Slow, deep breaths.

567
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:12,792
Feel the air fill your lungs.
Good.

568
00:26:12,834 --> 00:26:14,709
Good. Just like that.

569
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:20,166
Good.

570
00:26:20,208 --> 00:26:22,083
Her airways are opening up.

571
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:23,792
What happened?

572
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:26,792
How could this happen
after we took every precaution?

573
00:26:26,834 --> 00:26:28,166
I don't know.

574
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:29,166
I don't know.

575
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:35,917
Hi.

576
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:40,208
Well, I don't know
if the condom broke or leaked.

577
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,834
It could've been too big.

578
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:44,625
People have a tendency
to buy 'em a little big.

579
00:26:44,667 --> 00:26:48,041
Anyway, there was
seminal fluid present.
It's not your fault, Henry.

580
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:50,041
But it is.
You're allergic to me.

581
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:53,458
We got unlucky. It broke.
How often does that happen?

582
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,041
We'll be fine.

583
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:57,333
I-I can't have sex
knowing that every time,

584
00:26:57,375 --> 00:26:59,750
something could go wrong
and I could kill you.

585
00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:01,417
Henry--
I love you.

586
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:05,041
I never thought I'd find
somebody who gets me.

587
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:08,041
I don't want to be alone,
but the thought of hurting you--

588
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:10,041
guys, guys,
let me find something.

589
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:14,333
The last thing I want
is for you to... forgo sex.

590
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:17,041
I will find a way. Okay?

591
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:28,375
I haven't been stood up
since...

592
00:27:28,417 --> 00:27:30,000
Oh, that's right. Ever.

593
00:27:30,041 --> 00:27:32,000
I'd like to thank you
for letting me experience

594
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:33,583
that unique humiliation

595
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:37,166
that I had somehow managed
to escape... until now.

596
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,959
I was supposed to meet you
back at your place.

597
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,083
You're just remembering this?

598
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:47,041
Vanessa, I'm so sorry.

599
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:50,041
I had a patient, and--and he'd
left the hospital.

600
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:51,959
I'm so sorry.

601
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I like you, Sam.

602
00:27:54,041 --> 00:27:56,166
I could really
see myself with you.

603
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:58,709
And a few years ago, I'd have
ignored this voice in my head

604
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,792
that says
you're not where I am.

605
00:28:00,834 --> 00:28:03,583
I'd try and make you feel
what I'm feeling.

606
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:06,625
I-I feel... I like you.

607
00:28:06,667 --> 00:28:08,583
Addison Montgomery.

608
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:11,166
My entire professional life,

609
00:28:11,208 --> 00:28:14,166
I have been riding
in the shadows of the reputation

610
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,792
of the famous
double board certified redhead.

611
00:28:16,834 --> 00:28:19,792
I am not gonna do it
in my personal life, too.
Ad-Addison and me--

612
00:28:19,834 --> 00:28:22,417
I don't want to know.

613
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:26,041
I'm a catch, Sam--

614
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:27,834
an honest-to-god catch.

615
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:31,792
But you're gonna have to
chase me to catch me.

616
00:28:31,834 --> 00:28:33,583
Vanessa--

617
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:44,375
Esau, are you all right?

618
00:28:44,417 --> 00:28:46,417
It's Elisha. She's in labor.
Okay, let's notify the o.B.

619
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:49,041
And get her upstairs
on a monitor.

620
00:28:49,083 --> 00:28:51,834
You're doing great, Elisha.
We were on our way
to her mom's

621
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:53,917
because I was scared
about immigration,

622
00:28:53,959 --> 00:28:56,041
but then
the contractions started.

623
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:59,500
Come on, we should get you
back to isolation.
No, no. I need to be with her.

624
00:28:59,542 --> 00:29:01,583
It's not safe
for either of them.

625
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:03,834
Come. Come with me. Esau.

626
00:29:09,417 --> 00:29:12,041
You gonna pull your hair out?

627
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,166
No, no.
Yeah, well... maybe.

628
00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:16,792
I'm not sure bald's
the right look for you.

629
00:29:16,834 --> 00:29:19,166
I'm just having a bad run.

630
00:29:19,208 --> 00:29:21,166
You, too?

631
00:29:21,208 --> 00:29:24,834
Cooper's back.
He's all zen.

632
00:29:26,083 --> 00:29:27,417
It bothers you?

633
00:29:27,458 --> 00:29:29,417
I beat him with a banana.

634
00:29:29,458 --> 00:29:32,041
You gonna shrink me
and tell me why?

635
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:33,667
He's past the anger.

636
00:29:33,709 --> 00:29:36,041
You're afraid it means
he's really over you.

637
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:38,041
You're pretty good
at this stuff.

638
00:29:38,083 --> 00:29:40,875
No.
No, I'm failing everybody.

639
00:29:40,917 --> 00:29:42,875
I try to help people,
and they run.

640
00:29:42,917 --> 00:29:44,667
Violet ran.
Her patient ran.

641
00:29:44,709 --> 00:29:46,667
Two means
you're failing everybody?

642
00:29:46,709 --> 00:29:49,041
Don't shrinks tell people

643
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:51,041
to avoid global statements
like that?

644
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:53,041
Yeah, well,
it feels like everybody.

645
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:55,125
Do you know how hard
I tried to help Violet?

646
00:29:55,166 --> 00:29:58,000
Maybe you didn't push too hard.
You didn't push hard enough.

647
00:29:58,041 --> 00:30:00,125
I can't force a patient
to continue therapy.

648
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:03,000
You can let her know
quitting's for losers.

649
00:30:03,041 --> 00:30:05,166
Nudge her
in the right direction.

650
00:30:05,208 --> 00:30:07,792
You can show her settling
is a coward's way out.

651
00:30:07,834 --> 00:30:11,458
Or you can sit here and pull
your hair out until you go bald.

652
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,041
Thank you.

653
00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:14,959
Whatever.

654
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,041
Pete...

655
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:22,083
You don't
have to find a cure.

656
00:30:22,125 --> 00:30:24,041
He broke up with me.

657
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:27,542
I just wanted
to let you know.

658
00:30:27,583 --> 00:30:30,709
I didn't want
to waste your time.
I'm so sorry, may. Here.

659
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:35,417
Oh.

660
00:30:36,792 --> 00:30:38,166
I can't stop crying.

661
00:30:38,208 --> 00:30:39,792
Well, I know it's hard,

662
00:30:39,834 --> 00:30:41,792
losing something
you felt was right,

663
00:30:41,834 --> 00:30:44,375
but sex...

664
00:30:44,417 --> 00:30:46,041
Is important.

665
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:48,041
And maybe it's better
to end it now

666
00:30:48,083 --> 00:30:50,000
before it got serious.

667
00:30:50,041 --> 00:30:52,041
I know I just met him,

668
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:54,041
and that may not
make sense to you,

669
00:30:54,083 --> 00:30:56,041
but... oh, he was the one.

670
00:30:56,083 --> 00:31:00,041
I've spent my whole life
waiting for someone like Henry.

671
00:31:00,083 --> 00:31:03,625
And now he's gone.

672
00:31:05,917 --> 00:31:08,792
But... oh,
he still has my heart.

673
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:11,166
And maybe he always will.

674
00:31:11,208 --> 00:31:14,041
You'll find someone else.
Just give it time.

675
00:31:14,083 --> 00:31:17,375
Do you really believe that?

676
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,792
I do.

677
00:31:19,834 --> 00:31:21,792
I'm sorry.

678
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:27,417
Tell Naomi to forget about
the eggs, too.

679
00:31:27,458 --> 00:31:29,750
I can't do it on my own.

680
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,250
After Henry...

681
00:31:31,291 --> 00:31:33,000
I'm done.

682
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:38,166
Elisha's labor
is progressing quickly.

683
00:31:38,208 --> 00:31:40,458
But the baby--
everything looks good so far.

684
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,458
I'll have a neonatal team
standing by.

685
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:46,333
I'll give you an update as soon
as the baby's born, okay?

686
00:31:50,458 --> 00:31:53,709
Is that esau ajawke?
Yes, it is.

687
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,041
I'm agent Jones with immigration
and customs enforcement.

688
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:59,041
I have an order here
to detain Mr. Ajawke.

689
00:32:06,083 --> 00:32:08,166
Addison.

690
00:32:08,208 --> 00:32:11,041
I told you not to call.
Well, I did
what I thought was right.

691
00:32:11,083 --> 00:32:13,041
How is
tearing them apart right?

692
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:16,041
She can't go to Kenya.
He can't stay here.
What do you want me to say?

693
00:32:16,083 --> 00:32:18,041
Sometimes love
doesn't always work out.

694
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:19,709
No, sometimes it doesn't.

695
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:22,709
Oh, come on now.
I'm trying to move on here.

696
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,291
I'm trying to be happy.

697
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:26,041
Yeah, well, good for you.

698
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:28,667
In the meantime, I have to
deliver Elisha's baby--

699
00:32:28,709 --> 00:32:31,083
a baby that esau
isn't even going to see.

700
00:32:31,125 --> 00:32:34,000
How are they
supposed to move on?

701
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:39,041
"On semen"?
A little light reading?

702
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:41,750
May almost died.

703
00:32:41,792 --> 00:32:44,709
Henry's condom broke
or leaked.

704
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,792
He left her.

705
00:32:46,834 --> 00:32:48,709
Oh, that's awful.

706
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,166
They were perfect.

707
00:32:50,208 --> 00:32:52,750
It makes you wonder if there's
some kind of message in it--

708
00:32:52,792 --> 00:32:54,750
biology telling them
they don't belong together.

709
00:32:54,792 --> 00:32:56,750
Well... I mean,
there are the people

710
00:32:56,792 --> 00:32:58,750
that are right
for you on paper,

711
00:32:58,792 --> 00:33:01,458
and then there are the people
that are just right.

712
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,000
Is it settling

713
00:33:03,041 --> 00:33:06,333
if you go with the person
who's right for you on paper?

714
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:08,291
Maybe there's nothing wrong
with settling...

715
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:11,333
With being wooed.
Sometimes the person
who's just right...

716
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:13,083
Doesn't want you.

717
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:17,375
Or they do,
and they are just... wrong.

718
00:33:17,417 --> 00:33:18,834
Yeah.

719
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,792
Are we gonna have--

720
00:33:23,834 --> 00:33:27,041
have this discussion? No, no.
No, okay.

721
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:30,291
Oh. God, I really wanted may
to get her guy.

722
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:32,417
Me, too.

723
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:50,542
I'm sorry.
This isn't something I do.

724
00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:53,542
I value your privacy and your
decision to not do therapy.

725
00:33:53,583 --> 00:33:56,041
Dr. Wallace--
no, I just
have something to say,

726
00:33:56,083 --> 00:33:57,542
and then I'll leave,

727
00:33:57,583 --> 00:34:00,041
and you can do
whatever feels right for you.

728
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:02,792
I wanted to be a surgeon.
Look, I d--i don't--

729
00:34:02,834 --> 00:34:05,250
medical school,
Stanford, 1986--

730
00:34:05,291 --> 00:34:09,375
E.R. rotation
during my internship.

731
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:14,041
My first night on call,
there was a bus accident.

732
00:34:14,083 --> 00:34:16,041
The place
was flooded with people,

733
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:18,583
and I was assigned this guy
whose leg was mangled,

734
00:34:18,625 --> 00:34:20,583
and--and he was in pain.

735
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:25,417
He was yelling
and screaming at me, and...

736
00:34:25,458 --> 00:34:29,041
I couldn't stop the bleeding.

737
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:31,792
I called for help,
and--and everyone was busy.

738
00:34:31,834 --> 00:34:35,041
And this guy, he--he started
kicking and yelling at me.

739
00:34:35,083 --> 00:34:37,041
And I let go
of the compression,

740
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:39,583
and he bled out.

741
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:42,709
And he kept yelling at me
until he was dead.

742
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,000
I faked illness
for the rest of the week,

743
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:49,458
and as soon as I could,
I switched to psychiatry.

744
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,041
See, I ran.

745
00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:53,667
My father was a surgeon.

746
00:34:53,709 --> 00:34:57,417
And that's all I ever wanted
was to make him proud.

747
00:34:57,458 --> 00:35:00,542
I haven't been through
a plane crash.

748
00:35:00,583 --> 00:35:02,458
But I know what it's like

749
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:06,041
not to push through
what you want to do.

750
00:35:06,083 --> 00:35:08,041
And y-you saved yourself,
Natasha.

751
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:11,959
That-that's not wrong.
No, it--it's human. It is.

752
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,083
And I don't want
to push you to be scared.

753
00:35:14,125 --> 00:35:16,083
I want to push you
past being scared

754
00:35:16,125 --> 00:35:18,959
so you can have what you want,
so you can have the life

755
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,959
you wanted to have
before the crash.

756
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,333
And I know I'm not Violet,
but I can help you.

757
00:35:23,375 --> 00:35:25,458
So just please...
Let me help you.

758
00:35:36,709 --> 00:35:39,625
We'll be heading out soon.
Mm-hmm.

759
00:35:41,208 --> 00:35:43,417
Copy that.

760
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:48,750
The ambulance arrived.
We're gonna be taking him now.

761
00:35:48,792 --> 00:35:51,166
Uh, I'm sorry. You can't.
The nurses just paged me.

762
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:53,542
His oxygen levels
have dropped.

763
00:35:53,583 --> 00:35:55,500
It's probably
due to the infection

764
00:35:55,542 --> 00:35:59,041
or the fluid that's collecting
in his lungs.
Is that right?

765
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:01,041
Look, if you take him now,

766
00:36:01,083 --> 00:36:04,166
you'll have a body on your hands
by the time you get there.

767
00:36:04,208 --> 00:36:07,542
Thank you.

768
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:11,166
Dr. Montgomery's
delivering your baby.

769
00:36:11,208 --> 00:36:13,792
If you want to see him,
put this mask on

770
00:36:13,834 --> 00:36:16,041
and start acting sicker.

771
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:18,166
I think you're lying.

772
00:36:18,208 --> 00:36:21,041
Are you sure?
Are you a doctor?

773
00:36:21,083 --> 00:36:23,750
You might want to step back.
He's very contagious.

774
00:36:23,792 --> 00:36:25,750
Wouldn't want
to put you at risk.

775
00:36:27,166 --> 00:36:29,125
We'll wait
till he's stable.

776
00:36:39,583 --> 00:36:42,166
Henry.

777
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:44,875
I asked Henry to come
because--
he can fix it, may.

778
00:36:44,917 --> 00:36:46,458
You--you can fix it?

779
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,458
I can try to fix it.

780
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,458
There are breakthroughs
being made

781
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,458
in desensitizing people
to this type of allergy.

782
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,041
Uh, desensitizing, how?

783
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:57,041
I would use injections
of Henry's seminal fluid.

784
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:59,583
Mm-hmm.
Expose you to small traces

785
00:36:59,625 --> 00:37:02,333
and build up
your immune response over time.

786
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:05,333
How much time?
It could take six months,
maybe a year.

787
00:37:05,375 --> 00:37:07,959
There's no guarantee
this will work.

788
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,333
Look, I told you
that it would be okay,

789
00:37:10,375 --> 00:37:12,083
you could move on.

790
00:37:12,125 --> 00:37:14,500
