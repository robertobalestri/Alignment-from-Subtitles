than a stomachache.

a hockey player, Oliver?

I'm Dr. Freedman.

00:03:52,834 --> 00:03:55,291

take this off so we--

89
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,959
uh, I can't.
My parents don't let me.

90
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:09,375
Oliver, um...

91
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:11,083
He eats things.

92
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,917

ice cream and too many cookies?

93
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:16,041
He ate part of his pillow
last night.
Well, it started out small,

94
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:18,041
you know, pieces of
the couch cushion,

95
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,709
um, stuffed animals.

96
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,041
It started after Kelly and I
got married last year.

97
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,041
I don't know
if it's the change or...

98
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,041
I think of Oliver
as my own.

99
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:29,709

along has set him off somehow.

106
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:50,500
I mean... it is great,
right?

107
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,125
She called me this morning.
She wants to see him again.

108
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:57,041
I told her I'd bring him
to the office tomorrow.

109
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,041
Is that okay with you?
You're his father.

110
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:02,000
You have to do
what you think is best.
Addison--

111
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:06,041
I'm not his mother.
Violet is.
Yeah, but you're always
putting him to bed,

112
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,875
you play with him, you feed him,
you give him a bath,

113
00:05:07,917 --> 00:05:11,041
you hold him when he cries.
You're not nobody to him.

114
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:13,625
Yes, but he's her child.

115
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:22,041

to be okay with this--

116
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:25,625

117
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:28,041

118
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:31,041
I don't even know
if Violet is ready.

119
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,041
But if she is,

120
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:36,125
I need you... to help me
be okay with it.

121
00:05:38,792 --> 00:05:40,500
I'm okay.

122
00:05:40,542 --> 00:05:42,583

00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,667
This is embarrassing.
If the guys in my unit knew

126
00:05:56,709 --> 00:05:58,834
I was being checked out
by a gynecologist,

127
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:01,041
they'd never let me
live it down.

128
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:03,041
You smacked your head
passing out on the toilet.

129
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:05,333
This isn't the embarrassing
part of the story.
The gyno gave you a referral.

130
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,417
I promise you,
I only do brains.

131
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,834
I'm fine, okay?
This is crazy.

132
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:11,834
I probably passed out
'cause of too much r&amp;R.

133
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,792
I talked my way
into three weeks

134
00:06:13,834 --> 00:06:16,041
to come back
and see the baby born.

135
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,125
I'm just used to living
like this.

136
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:21,000
Clean sheets, no gunfire--
it's not normal.
Has anything like this
ever happened before?

137
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:23,959
Sometimes I get dizzy.

138
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,542

are brutal.
Have you noticed
any visual changes?

139
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,709
Numbness or weakness?
Nope.

140
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,375

141
00:06:32,417 --> 00:06:34,875

142
00:06:34,917 --> 00:06:36,250
His head's fine.

143
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:39,041
See, honey, I told you.
Clean bill of health.

144
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:42,041
But your screening E.K.G. is
showing some subtle abnormality.

145
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,709
I don't understand.
You said his head was fine.

146
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,041
Oh, she's saying

147
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:49,709
that there might be
a problem with your heart.

148
00:06:53,542 --> 00:06:55,917
Hi. Oliver.

149
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,583
Am I a freak?

150
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,625
Do you think you're a freak?

151
00:07:02,667 --> 00:07:06,041
I ate part of a book once
in class.

152
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,041
No other kids do that.

153
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:11,041
So I got in big trouble
with the teacher.

154
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,083
You see what I mean?
It--it--
you know, when...

155
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,959
Kids eat like you do,

156
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,208
you know, weird stuff,

157
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,041
it's usually
something called pica.

158
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,750
Other kids do it, too?
Yeah.

159
00:07:22,792 --> 00:07:25,250
I mean, it's rare, but that
makes you pretty special.

160
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:28,041
So it's a thing?
You can cure him?

161
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,041
I can prescribe fiber
for the stomachache.

162
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:33,041
But pica can have
all sorts of causes.

163
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,959
Oliver...

164
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,667
Do you know
why you do this?

165
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:39,166
I don't know.

166
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:43,542
I just...
I can't stop.

167
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,000
Okay.

168
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,750
Oh, hey.

169
00:07:52,792 --> 00:07:55,917
What do you know about pica
in 10 year olds?

170
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:58,250
Well, if a kid's got
a mouth full of splinters,

171
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:02,041
and you're missing a box of
tongue depressors, it's pica.
It's not really that simple.

172
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,125
I mean, that kind of behavior
could be o.C.D.

173
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:07,375
Or a nutritional deficiency,
neurological or trauma response.

174
00:08:07,417 --> 00:08:10,625
I mean, sometimes,
we never figure it out.
Well, I'll give you
a head start.

175
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:12,625
The kid's got
a new stepfather.

176
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:14,625
The problem started
around the same time.

177
00:08:14,667 --> 00:08:17,625
The stepfather's solution is to
lock a hockey mask on his face.

178
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:20,709
I was gonna talk to Violet about
it, but it's her first day back.

179
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,041
I don't wanna...
Could you see him?
Sure, sure.
I'm happy to be second choice.

180
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,583
Thanks.

181
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:32,125
See ya.

182
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:38,959
You know, I'm glad
Sheldon is thorough,

183
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,166
but next time
I go out of town,

184
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:44,000
remind me to have someone
cover my patients

185
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:46,000
who takes
less copious notes.

186
00:08:51,417 --> 00:08:53,250
So...

187
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:59,166
So?

188
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,166
So what's up
with you and Charlotte?

189
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,208
I was asking about you.
You said "so."

190
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,667
Yeah,
which means "how are you?"
I'm good. Can't I be good?

191
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:09,041
Two months, no phone calls,
no e-mails, no postcards...

192
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,792
Now... you're good?

193
00:09:10,834 --> 00:09:12,208
I am.

194
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,041
I'm good.

195
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,083
You know,
i-i-i would be better

196
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,875

was sleeping with Addison

197
00:09:18,917 --> 00:09:21,083
before I came home.
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry
about that. I should've--

198
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:24,291
oh, wait. No phone calls,
no e-mails, no postcards.

199
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,250
Okay.

200
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,041
Okay. I'm sorry.

201
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,250
Thank you.

202
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:32,709
So what is up
with you and Charlotte?

203
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:36,375
I'm maintaining a mature,
professional distance.

204
00:09:36,417 --> 00:09:38,458
She wants to be friends.

205
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,208
And what do you want?

206
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,875
Life is sucky and hard.

207
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:49,041
Preaching to the choir,
baby.

208
00:09:51,542 --> 00:09:53,417
Oh, I'm glad you're back.

209
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,041
Mm.

210
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:58,041
Lucia... I know that
you're worried about Carl.

211
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,041
But if there is a problem
with his heart,

212
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,291
Dr. Bennett will find it.
I hope so.

213
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:05,208
He's the best.
No, I mean, I hope he will...

214
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,083
Find something wrong.

215
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,750
This is
his fourth tour of duty.

216
00:10:09,792 --> 00:10:11,041
When I hear on the news

217
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:14,041
that a roadside bomb went off
killing six,

218
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:17,083
I wonder if one of them
was Carl.

219
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,542
When officers come around,

220
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:21,417
I pray that
they don't stop by my house.

221
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:24,333
I just feel like
I'm waiting for him to die.

222
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:27,917
I'm not sure
what you're asking me to do.

223
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:31,125
If you could find something
or say there's something,

224
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:34,125
something that means he can't
go back to Iraq at all...

225
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:38,083
I love him.
Help me keep him alive.

226
00:10:43,917 --> 00:10:45,750
Hey.

227
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Are those, uh,
Carl's cardiac c.T.S?

228
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:57,834
So what, are you not
talking to me now either?

229
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,583
Because you know what? I really
can't handle that today, Sam.

230
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:03,041
So be a grown-up.
Use your words.
Vanessa and I broke up.

231
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:06,041
Oh. I'm sorry.

232
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,333
I am. I know that we didn't
always get along--

233
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:11,041
you hated her. You hated
that I was with her.

234
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,041
So don't say you're sorry.

235
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:15,041
It's a lie. You know it,
and I know it.

236
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:18,041
See... you want to have
your cake and eat it, too.

237
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:21,041
But you know what? You can't,
because I'm the cake.

238
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,625
And from here on out,
I'm taking the cake away.

239
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:26,041
No more cake for you.
I'm good cake, too.

240
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,750
Double chocolate, cream-filled

241
00:11:27,792 --> 00:11:29,792
with the little raspberries
on top.

242
00:11:29,834 --> 00:11:32,834
So no more cake for you.
So just shut up.

243
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,125
Okay.

244
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:37,041
Carl has a block in his l.A.D.
It's called a widowmaker.

245
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,041
We're lucky we found it.
Coulda killed him.

246
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:43,041
So what are you gonna do?
Well, he's a perfect candidate
for a stent.

247
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,166
After the procedure,
he should be good as new.

248
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:46,959
Maybe drug therapy
would work.

249
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,125
Wait. The kid's serving
in a war zone, Addison.

250
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,875
You want to slow down
his heart, his entire system?

251
00:11:51,917 --> 00:11:54,041
You know,
do you think he can perform

252
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:56,041
to the level he needs to
on--on beta-blockers?

253
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,250
Probably not.
He'd be discharged.

254
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:01,375
So you're saying you want me
to do something less effective

255
00:12:01,417 --> 00:12:04,500
so that they'll pull him
out of military service?
This is not about me, Sam.

256
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:07,625
Lucia's gonna have his baby.
She wants to keep him around.

257
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:11,041
Well, you can't always get
what you want.

258
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,041
Ugh.

259
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,041
I don't know.

260
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,875
Surgery sounds risky.

261
00:12:21,917 --> 00:12:24,041
But if I take the medication,
I can't go back?

262
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,583
I can't make
that determination,

263
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:28,291
but will it have an affect
on your performance? It might.

264
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,291
But, honey,
if you're sick, then--

265
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,875
look, I'm not sick.

266
00:12:32,917 --> 00:12:35,041
I'm not. I have a thing,
and Dr. Bennett can fix it.

267
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:37,625
I locate I.E.D.S, bombs.

268
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:41,083
I have people in my squad
who depend on me to stay alive.

269
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,667
I depend on you
to stay alive.

270
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:46,542
Your baby depends on you
to stay alive.

271
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:49,333
The army can replace you.
I can't.

272
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:56,542
Can you fix this with surgery,
make me as good as new?

273
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:59,125
I can.

274
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:04,709
I want the surgery.
I'm a soldier. It's what I do.

275
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,291
And I want to go back.

276
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,041
So how's it been
with your stepdad Scott,

277
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:14,000
you know,
since they got married?
He's pretty cool.

278
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:16,000
I've never had a dad before,

279
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:19,041
so we get to do
some stuff together, fun stuff.

280
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,709
But I think
he's a little freaked out

281
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,458
by this whole eating thing.
What about your mom?

282
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,125
She got me the mask.
Your mom got you the mask?

283
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,041
Yeah.

284
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,750
What do you think of it?

285
00:13:30,792 --> 00:13:32,750
Well, it's uncomfortable,

286
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:34,792
but it does
kinda help me stop.

287
00:13:34,834 --> 00:13:37,875

I'm not even thinking,

Mm.

433
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,792
You give him vitamins
and an hour of therapy,

434
00:20:15,834 --> 00:20:18,959
and then he goes home
and eats dirt. Literally dirt.

435
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,041
As I tried to explain to you
yesterday, we can work with him.

436
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,250
But there isn't always
a simple answer.

437
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,041
Now all we can do is work

438
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,834
to redirect his urges
to other things.

439
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:30,041
Straight out of
the flower bed--dirt.
I'm sorry.

440
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:33,250
Kelly, don't you think that
he wants to change this?

441
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:37,208
I think if he wanted to,
he would.

442
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:40,375
And I'm afraid this whole thing
is gonna be too much for Scott.

443
00:20:40,417 --> 00:20:42,041
He has been patient.

444
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,041
He has been a Saint
with all this.

445
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:46,041
But what I need from you,
you professionals,

446
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,792
is to do something.
So basically,
what you're saying is,

447
00:20:48,834 --> 00:20:50,792
you care more about keeping
your husband

448
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:52,834
than you do
about helping your child?
Cooper.

449
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,041
I just...

450
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,041
Want him to be normal.

451
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:59,333
Putting a mask on his face
does not make him feel normal.

452
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,959
I am trying to help him.
Are you?
Why don't we dial this back?

453
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,333
Look, I see a lot of kids
with a lot of issues,

454
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:06,667
and all I'm trying to say is,
Oliver is hurting.

455
00:21:06,709 --> 00:21:09,500
He is hurting in some way,
and you need to let me figure--

456
00:21:09,542 --> 00:21:13,125
you--you need to let Dr. Wallace
figure out what that is.

457
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:17,166
And however hard it is on you,
it is harder on him.

458
00:21:20,917 --> 00:21:23,333
That was unprofessional
in there.

459
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:25,333
She should be worried
about her son,

460
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:28,625
not her husband or herself.
Oh, and you think telling her
off is gonna make things better?

461
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:31,333
Look, you are agitated
about this patient

462
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,041
and about Charlotte.

463
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:36,000
Charlotte has nothing
to do with it.
Maybe, maybe not.

464
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:38,917
But something about her
still pushes your buttons.

465
00:21:38,959 --> 00:21:40,500
Button-pushing, we call it.

466
00:21:40,542 --> 00:21:42,500
Yeah. She told me
about last night.

467
00:21:42,542 --> 00:21:45,500
Oh, that is
so none of your business.

468
00:21:45,542 --> 00:21:48,291
When it affects our patient,
it is.

469
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:51,458
I'm not trying to fix something
because my life is broken.

470
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,875
My life is fine.
It's the patient that is broken.

471
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:55,208
Fix him.

472
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,417

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

473
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:04,083

just having a bottle.

474
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:07,709

If this too much for you--

475
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,542

477
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:14,125
It's not enough.

478
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,125
I mean, it would be one thing
if I was a bad mother,

479
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:21,333
if I was mean to my kid
or hit my kid.

480
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:24,041
But i'm...
Not a mother at all.

481
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:26,041
You are.

482
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:28,583

You saved Lucas' life.

487
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:43,417
And I am grateful for that,
really.

488
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:45,041
It's just that...

489
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:46,834
This...

490
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:49,250
You and Lucas,

491
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:52,041
you and Pete...

492
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:55,041
I mean, I expected a lot
of things when I came home,

493
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:58,458
but my son loving you
was not one of them.

494
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:09,417
I can't have kids.
Did you know that?

495
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:11,458
I've got, like, one egg left

496
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,041
or something horrible...
Like that,

497
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:16,041
and--and I'm okay with it.

498
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:19,000
I am. I had made... my peace.

499
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:22,000
I... Wasn't
one of those crazy women

500
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:25,792
who cried, you know,
every time she saw... a baby.

501
00:23:25,834 --> 00:23:27,792
I just shut it down.

502
00:23:27,834 --> 00:23:33,500
But then, uh...
Pete and I happened, and...

503
00:23:33,542 --> 00:23:35,625
That meant Lucas, too.

504
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:39,041
And it was so scary for me,
you know, to...

505
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:41,625
Allow myself to...

506
00:23:41,667 --> 00:23:45,250
Enjoy him, to... love him.

507
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:50,291
But when I did,
it was like...

508
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:53,041
It was like I was broken...

509
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:55,041
And Lucas fixed me.

510
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:58,208
And now I can't imagine
my life without him.

511
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,583

513

That you're back,
genuinely,

514
00:24:05,917 --> 00:24:09,208
because I...
I like you, Violet,

515
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,875
and what happened to you
was so...

516
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:16,291
But for me, it means--

517
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:18,917
i-i...

518
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:20,291

it's hard for me, too.

00:24:28,417 --> 00:24:30,500
I want to hate you
so badly.

521
00:24:30,542 --> 00:24:32,750
I want to punch you
in the face.

522
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:42,041
Well, I should go.
And you...

523
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:45,083
You're doing fine...
With him.

524
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:46,667
I know.

525
00:24:46,709 --> 00:24:48,375
Right?

526
00:24:48,417 --> 00:24:50,375
I mean, I wasn't sure
if I would.

527
00:24:50,417 --> 00:24:52,375
I-I've never been good
with kids--

528
00:24:52,417 --> 00:24:55,125
other people's kids--
but, uh...

529
00:24:55,166 --> 00:24:59,000
I'm good at taking care
of my son.

530
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:05,834
He'll pick you...

531
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:09,583
Because you're his mother,
you know.

532
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:12,959
In the end,
he'll pick you.

533
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,166
What are you talking about?

534
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:17,166
Babies get adopted
all the time.

535
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:18,625
They love
their adopted mothers.

536
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:21,625
They--they don't even think
about their birth mothers.

537
00:25:21,667 --> 00:25:25,125
I wasn't
talking about Lucas.

538
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:38,333
What happened?
Oh, my god. Scott and I
got in an argument.

539
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:41,041
It was over Oliver. He overheard
it. He got upset and he ran--
I found him in the garage.
He was looking white

540
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:43,542
and he was scared.
What's in the garage?

541
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:47,041
Everything--bug spray,
uh, uh, gardening stuff.
Oliver, can you
tell me what you ate?

542
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:49,125
Hey. Can you tell me
what you ate?

543
00:25:49,166 --> 00:25:51,125
I need a chem panel,
a tox screen,

544
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:53,583
and let's give him
50 of charcoal.
What--what is that?
What are you doing?

545
00:25:53,625 --> 00:25:56,041
They're going to pump
his stomach.
Oh!

546
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:58,166
Oliver. Hey, buddy,
you're gonna be okay.

547
00:25:58,208 --> 00:26:00,709
It's a routine surgery.

548
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:03,375
I'm coming back.

549
00:26:03,417 --> 00:26:05,667
Your wife really loves you.

550
00:26:05,709 --> 00:26:07,875
I mean, it's gotta be
hard on her,

551
00:26:07,917 --> 00:26:09,667
worrying about you
all the time.

552
00:26:09,709 --> 00:26:12,667
What, you think that I don't
worry about her, especially now?

553
00:26:12,709 --> 00:26:15,041
Hell, I know that
I should be here. I do.

554
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:17,041
A man
should be with his child.

555
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:19,291
But, you know, Lucia's gonna
be here when I get back,

556
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:22,458
and if I stay, I can't say
the same thing about my guys.
There are other guys

557
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,500
who can take your place
over there.

558
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:27,500
If everyone said that, who'd be
there fighting for us?
Well, I'm guessing your wife

559
00:26:27,542 --> 00:26:29,500
would rather
you were fighting for her.

560
00:26:29,542 --> 00:26:31,166
It's a girl thing.

561
00:26:31,208 --> 00:26:33,208
Well, you pull me
through this,

562
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:36,250
and I'll make sure
I fight for both.

563
00:26:38,667 --> 00:26:40,333
His vessels have calcified.

564
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:43,041
I don't know
if the stent's gonna hold.

565
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:46,542
I'm gonna open up his chest
and bypass the vessel.

566
00:26:46,583 --> 00:26:48,333
The stent should compress
and seal the tear.

567
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:50,291
You could wait,
see if it holds.

568
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:53,750
I mean, you convert to bypass,
he's not going back.

569
00:26:55,792 --> 00:26:57,875
All right, notify O.R.
I'm gonna bypass.

570
00:26:59,542 --> 00:27:02,041
So lawn furniture,
huh, Oliver?

571
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:04,750
You ate
some moldy lawn furniture.

572
00:27:04,792 --> 00:27:07,041
Just the cushions.

573
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:10,041
Oh, yeah. I know. I saw it
while it was coming up.

574
00:27:12,083 --> 00:27:14,333
Your throat's gonna be sore
for a little while,

575
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:17,333
but we'll run some tests,
we'll make sure you're okay,

576
00:27:17,375 --> 00:27:19,333
and then we'll get you home.
All right?

577
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:22,333
I'm just gonna eat
more stuff.

578
00:27:22,375 --> 00:27:24,333
Why don't you just
keep me here

579
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:27,750
and sew my mouth shut?
Hey, believe me. If I could
sew a kid's mouth shut,

580
00:27:27,792 --> 00:27:30,333
I would be
a really wealthy pediatrician.

581
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,458
You just worry
about getting better.

582
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,792
I'll figure this out.
I'm gonna get you some water.

583
00:27:44,417 --> 00:27:46,166
Oh...

584
00:27:50,125 --> 00:27:52,041
Hi.

585
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:54,333
Hey.

586
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:59,291
Um... Lucas isn't here.
The nanny went--

587
00:27:59,333 --> 00:28:00,834
oh, that's okay.

588
00:28:00,875 --> 00:28:02,792
I wanted to talk to you
about us.

589
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:07,041
Yeah?

590
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:10,500
Oh, not--i mean...
Not "us" us.

591
00:28:10,542 --> 00:28:14,166
I-I meant what we're gonna do
about Lucas.

592
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,959
What do you mean?

593
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,625
Uh, well, um,

594
00:28:17,667 --> 00:28:19,166
I ordered a crib online,

595
00:28:19,208 --> 00:28:21,166
and it should be here
on Thursday.

596
00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:23,542
And, uh, my house was
already childproofed.

597
00:28:23,583 --> 00:28:26,208
And I ordered, uh, diapers
and car seats and toys

598
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:29,208
and all that stuff.
You don't have to
buy him things, Violet.

599
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,375
Well, I mean,
I'm gonna need it.

600
00:28:31,417 --> 00:28:33,417
And I figured we could
work out a schedule,

601
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:35,417
and I could pay half of
the nanny bill,

602
00:28:35,458 --> 00:28:37,750
and I'm totally willing
to reimburse you

603
00:28:37,792 --> 00:28:40,250
for any back child care
or any other expenditures

604
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:42,667
that you may have--
w-w-wait--wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

605
00:28:42,709 --> 00:28:44,667
What are you talking about?

606
00:28:44,709 --> 00:28:48,250
W--look, I-I know this is not
gonna happen right away.

607
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:51,291
I know it's a process.

608
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:55,041
So I figured we could
transition Lucas very slowly.

609
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:58,792
Start out with daily visits,
then maybe an overnight,

610
00:28:58,834 --> 00:29:00,875
maybe one week with you,
one week with me--

611
00:29:00,917 --> 00:29:02,875
no.

612
00:29:02,917 --> 00:29:04,208
No?

613
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:07,041
You've been back
for two days.

614
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:09,291
Let's...
Take this slow.

615
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:12,041
You were recently thinking
about moving to New York,

616
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,500
for god sake--
right, I-I told you,
that was a crisis point.

617
00:29:14,542 --> 00:29:17,208
Which to me means I'm not
letting you have Lucas.

618
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,709
Okay, Pete, Pete, just--let's
just slow down, start again.

619
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:22,041
All I'm saying
is that I want to share--

620
00:29:22,083 --> 00:29:23,458
no.
What--

621
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,041
my son is not going to be
part of your therapy.

622
00:29:26,083 --> 00:29:28,041
I'm his father.
And I'm his mother.

623
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:29,875
Who gave him away.

624
00:29:29,917 --> 00:29:33,709
You showed up at my doorstep
and you gave him away.

625
00:29:35,333 --> 00:29:37,083
That was low, Pete.

626
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:40,083
You know what I've been through.
You know what I...

627
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:42,542
Y--you know me.

628
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:44,625
Come on, Pete.
You know me.

629
00:29:44,667 --> 00:29:46,625
I do know you,
but this isn't about you.

630
00:29:46,667 --> 00:29:49,041
I have to do
what's best for Lucas.

631
00:30:12,291 --> 00:30:14,917
So...

632
00:30:14,959 --> 00:30:17,792
Your son
is struggling with pica,

633
00:30:17,834 --> 00:30:20,792
and you have it, too,
and you didn't say anything,

634
00:30:20,834 --> 00:30:23,375
to him or to us.

635
00:30:23,417 --> 00:30:25,583
You lied.

636
00:30:29,333 --> 00:30:31,291
How long do you think
you've had it?

637
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:33,166
Since I was a kid.

638
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:36,041
But only
when I was nervous

639
00:30:36,083 --> 00:30:39,417
or when things
were really bad.

640
00:30:39,458 --> 00:30:41,417
But I got it under control.

641
00:30:41,458 --> 00:30:45,583
I just...
Made myself stop...

642
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:47,208
Until today.

643
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:50,625
With Oliver so sick,
it was just so stressful, i--
stressful for you?

644
00:30:50,667 --> 00:30:53,041
It's stressful for him.
He's 10 years old.

645
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:56,000
And he's feeling weird enough
about this problem,

646
00:30:56,041 --> 00:30:59,250
and he has impulses
he doesn't know how to control,

647
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:02,417
and instead of telling him
that you have it, too,

648
00:31:02,458 --> 00:31:04,417
you put a mask on him.

649
00:31:04,458 --> 00:31:06,667
Well, I thought
that would stop it.

650
00:31:06,709 --> 00:31:09,959
I wanted to spare him that.

651
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,125
But you lied to him,

652
00:31:12,166 --> 00:31:15,166
making it so he can
never trust you...

653
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:17,166
About anything.

654
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:27,208
When we opened you up,
your coronary arteries

655
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:30,041
were too calcified
to hold the stent.

656
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:32,041
Now if I hadn't
converted to a bypass,

657
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:34,667
you would've had
a heart attack.

658
00:31:34,709 --> 00:31:37,041
But now you're okay.

659
00:31:38,542 --> 00:31:40,625
So what's the recovery time?

660
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:47,417
I don't think you'll be able
to return to active duty.

661
00:31:51,834 --> 00:31:53,875
I know you're upset--

662
00:31:53,917 --> 00:31:57,041
I told you
that I didn't want this.

663
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:58,583
This isn't what I wanted.

664
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:01,250
You're alive, Carl. You've got
a wife who loves you,

665
00:32:01,291 --> 00:32:03,041
a child on the way.

666
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:06,125
This is not a bad outcome.

667
00:32:06,166 --> 00:32:08,834
This is
what most people want.

668
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:13,000
This... is what
most people fight for.

669
00:32:37,375 --> 00:32:39,375
It was hard for her.

670
00:32:39,417 --> 00:32:41,375
Lying to your kid
is what should be hard.

671
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:44,458
You want to be a parent,
you should not... do that.

672
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,750
You should not lie.

673
00:32:46,792 --> 00:32:48,667
No. No, you shouldn't.

674
00:32:48,709 --> 00:32:50,375
No parent should.

675
00:32:51,709 --> 00:32:53,792
And if they do
and if it leaves a Mark,

676
00:32:53,834 --> 00:32:56,792
if that kid or any kid
is troubled by some lie

677
00:32:56,834 --> 00:32:59,041
or something
that wasn't said,

678
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:02,750
then they're really gonna need
to talk about it eventually.

679
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:10,542
Why don't you come in
and sit down?

680
00:33:10,583 --> 00:33:12,583
Why don't we just talk?

681
00:33:16,667 --> 00:33:19,834
Nothing to talk about.

had lied to me,

759

Well, they had
had a kid before me.

764
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:32,458
His name was Andy.

765
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,041
And for eight years,
he was their son,

766
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:37,917
and then one day...

767
00:37:37,959 --> 00:37:40,750
Well, he was very, very sick
and he died.

768
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:43,041
And then a couple of
years later, they adopted me.

769
00:37:43,083 --> 00:37:45,041
But they never told me
about Andy.

770
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:48,041
And, you know, so I grew up
thinking I was the only one.

771
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:51,750

772
