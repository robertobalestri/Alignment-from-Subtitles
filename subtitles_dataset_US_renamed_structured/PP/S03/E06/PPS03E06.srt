Mm-hmm. Chloé. On sale.

Chloé's never on sale,
you lucky bitch.

00:00:15,834 --> 00:00:17,709
I love Chloé...

And bottega veneta...
And--

00:00:21,792 --> 00:00:24,041
hermès.
Oh, hermès.

00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:26,000
I'll miss hermès.

Ohh.

Everything's tender.

It's gone to my liver,
hasn't it?

13
00:00:32,834 --> 00:00:35,375
I don't know, but we knew that
that was a possibility.

14
00:00:35,417 --> 00:00:38,375
I'd like to readmit you to
the hospital, run some tests.

15
00:00:38,417 --> 00:00:40,583
I can't. I can't go
to the hospital.

16
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:43,792
Lillie, I know that--
that this is scary, but--

17
00:00:43,834 --> 00:00:46,041
I'm not scared. I have
stage iv ovarian cancer.

18
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:49,333
I've had
two courses of chemo,

19
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:52,542
three biopsies,
one hysterectomy.

20
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:54,667
I'm way beyond scared.

21
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:57,291
It's Milo.

22
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,000
I... can't leave him.

23
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:01,250
Your cat?

24
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:04,083
Lil-Lillie, I know that
you're attached,

25
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:07,041
but...

26
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:09,041
He's my world.

27
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:12,208
I spent my life working
to make my design studio a go.

28
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,625
And it did, and it was great,
but...

29
00:01:14,667 --> 00:01:17,166
I thought there'd be time
for everything else,

30
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:18,667
and there wasn't.

31
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:20,417
But I had Milo.

32
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:23,625
And now...
I can't leave him alone.

33
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:28,041
Well, um... okay.

34
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:31,500
I can find you
a cat Walker

35
00:01:31,542 --> 00:01:33,667
or a sitter

36
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:36,709
or, you know,
a... whatever.

37
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,250
I--you... you need
to get back to the hospital.

38
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:42,750
I need to make sure
that Milo's okay.

39
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:45,709
I need to find somebody
to look after him...

40
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,667
Somebody I can trust.

41
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:56,667
♪ And steady it with grace ♪

42
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:59,041
Dr. Bennett.

43
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:01,041
Our patients
are already here.

44
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:03,041
They're very excited
to start treatment.

45
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:05,917
I'm sorry.
Uh, do I know you?
Gabriel fife.

46
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,917
Dr. Fife,
director of the g.R.P.

47
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,917
Genetic research program.

48
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:11,750
Uh, where?
Here.

49
00:02:11,792 --> 00:02:14,875
We don't have a g.R.P.
William hired me
two weeks ago.

50
00:02:14,917 --> 00:02:17,875
You should keep up
with your office e-mails.
I didn't get an e-mail

51
00:02:17,917 --> 00:02:20,875
because I'm the one
who's in charge of hiring.
William thought
we'd be good together,

52
00:02:20,917 --> 00:02:22,709
professionally speaking.

53
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,917
I've designed a technique
that improves the success rate

54
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,917
for complex implantations
in various high-risk groups.
What techniques?
What high-risk groups?

55
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:29,917
Meet the donovans--
Curtis and Sally.

56
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:33,333
They're here
for embryo implantation.

57
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:35,625
We want to have
a dwarf baby.

58
00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:42,375
And we're going to
give it to them.

59
00:02:42,417 --> 00:02:44,375
Dr. Fife's
been a godsend.

60
00:02:44,417 --> 00:02:46,917
We've wanted children
for so long.

61
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,792
But a child like us.

62
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:51,500
Without selection,
there's about a 50% chance

63
00:02:51,542 --> 00:02:54,834
they'll have a dwarf baby,
but with embryo selection

64
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,834
and isolating
the f.G.F.R.3 mutation,

65
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,959
it's guaranteed.

66
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,709
You guaranteed it?

67
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,583
I know it's odd
to some people,

68
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:08,083
people who see this
as a deformity or a disability.

69
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,625
But it's us.
It's who we are.

70
00:03:10,667 --> 00:03:13,792
So when Dr. Fife told us
about you...

71
00:03:13,834 --> 00:03:16,875
We are so grateful
you're gonna give us a baby,

72
00:03:16,917 --> 00:03:19,041
our baby. Thank you.

73
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,875
I just need time to review.

74
00:03:21,917 --> 00:03:24,792
Dr. Fife, may I speak
with you outside, please?

75
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,583
I know we just met,

76
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,792
but I think
you need to be careful.

77
00:03:42,834 --> 00:03:44,792
You don't exactly
exude the confidence

78
00:03:44,834 --> 00:03:47,041
most people expect
from their doctor.

79
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,417
Confidence?
Just trying to be helpful.
No harm done.

80
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:52,834
Tell me. What can I do
to expedite this process?

81
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:56,000
Um, I just met you
five minutes ago...
Mm-hmm.

82
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,250
And I haven't agreed
to do any of this.

83
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:02,041
I am uncomfortable with
the idea of designer babies,

84
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,917
and frankly,
you say you work here,

85
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:06,375
but I believe
that you are mistaken.

86
00:04:06,417 --> 00:04:08,417
William white hired me
to do exactly this.

87
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:11,041
This is his practice.
This is my practice.

88
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,041
Then you ought to read
your e-mails.

89
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,834
I'll schedule the implantation
for tomorrow.

90
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:18,000
Nice meeting you.

91
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,041
There was no e-mail.

92
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,709
I don't think I can move.

93
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,041
I can't get off the table.

94
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:30,667
Barbara--
please. I'm tired.

95
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:32,250
I want to stay here.

96
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,250
Tell Dr. Turner
I can't talk today.

97
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,250
No, you need to see her.

98
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,291
That's how you're fighting
your depression.

99
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:41,291
And you are fighting it.
You got here.
Jimmy had to drag me.

100
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,291
It doesn't matter.
You got here.

101
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:46,458
- You did your biofeedback.
- I don't feel better.

102
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,250
Which is why it's important
for you to go upstairs,

103
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:52,000
so the therapies
can work in concert.

104
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,000
I know you're trying to help,

105
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:56,000
and I know
everyone's trying to help,

106
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:59,041
I just... I'm done.
I want to die.

107
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:02,041
I don't know why you people
won't just let me kill myself

108
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:06,291
so I can stop
feeling like this.

109
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,667
So I said to him,
"you do smell, bad."

110
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:14,667
You said that
to the patient?
Yeah, I'm saying
what I think.

111
00:05:14,709 --> 00:05:16,667
It's freeing.
I'm telling them what I think.

112
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:19,041
And you know what?
They like it.
Okay.

113
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:21,709
Hey, hey.
Anybody want a cat?
Whoa.

114
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,208
A temporary--
temporary cat.

115
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,041
Nice pussy.

116
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,208
Oh, don't be childish.
I'm talking about the cat.

117
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,709
It's not mine.
It's my patient's.
Okay.
Well, just be careful.

118
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,417
Single woman, living alone--
first it's one cat,

119
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,417
then you're staying home Friday
nights watching chick flicks.

120
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:37,375
Next thing you know,
you're living

121
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:40,375
with nine cats
and a bird.
It's not mine.

122
00:05:40,417 --> 00:05:43,041
Why is catwoman so sexy,
but a woman with cats--

123
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,834
so not.
I think
you should keep the cat.

124
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:47,041
I think
it's a perfect opportunity

125
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:50,375
for someone with commitment
issues to work through them.

126
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:53,750
I'm saying what I think.
It's freeing.

127
00:05:53,792 --> 00:05:57,000
Violet, I am glad that you're
feeling better. I am.

128
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,166
But, uh, I do not have
commitment issues.

129
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:02,417
Hey, Charlotte.
I bet, uh, you like cats.

130
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:05,041
I'm allergic. I just wanted
to give you ladies

131
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:08,041
a little "thanks for welcoming
me to the practice" gift.

132
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,875
I just got 'em.
Please. Not in front of the...

133
00:06:10,917 --> 00:06:12,333
Cat.

134
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,041
Cat sitters, L.A.

135
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,000
Cats don't need a sitter.

136
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:20,041
Haven't you ever had
a pet before?

137
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:23,041
Yeah, we had horses...
With trainers and riders.

138
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:26,041
Oh, and I had
a pet hermit crab once.

139
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:29,041
But the air filter was
very noisy, so I shut it off,

140
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,625
and he died.

141
00:06:31,667 --> 00:06:34,375
I'm escaping.
Escaping who?

142
00:06:34,417 --> 00:06:37,083
My new director
of genetic research.

143
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,625
Ooh. Impressive. You guys
are going high-tech.

144
00:06:39,667 --> 00:06:43,041
William is. He hired him...
Behind my back.

145
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:47,041
Wait. Aren't you
supposed to be in charge?
Yes, I am.

146
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,041
Is he good?

147
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,041
He's brilliant,
and--and he's know it.

148
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,041
And he's arrogant
and he's rude

149
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,250
and... he's in a wheelchair.

150
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,875
Oh.
And his patients
are little people.

151
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,500
Oh.
And they want to do
a selective implantation.

152
00:07:00,542 --> 00:07:02,041
They want a little baby.

153
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:05,291
I, uh, I guess that leaves you
with a small problem.

154
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:08,709
Don't act like
you weren't thinking it.

155
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,041
Well, you're in charge, Nai.
Yes, I am. I am.

156
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:16,041
And genetic selection
is a line that I won't cross.

157
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,083
There you have it.
You just stand tall.

158
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:24,125
I gotta go find Cooper.
He'll laugh with me.

159
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:28,542
Why is there a cat in here?

160
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,291
So if the snot turns green,

161
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:35,041
you're gonna have your mom
call me, right?

162
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,041
Yes. All right,
give me five.

163
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,333
Get outta here.

164
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,041
His fever spikes, call me,
but otherwise, he's fine.

165
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,458
All right, bye.

166
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,083
Problem?

167
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,083
Addison or Sam
giving you a hard time?

168
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,083
You need me
to beat somebody up--

169
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,875
an o.W.G. Smackdown?

170
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:52,083
No patients.

171
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,083
Oh, well,
they'll grow to like you.

172
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,083
You're an acquired taste.
I did.

173
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:59,041
No patients, Cooper.
No people patients.

174
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:02,041
It's been two weeks,
and my practice is bombing.

175
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,041
It's embarrassing.
Charlotte--

176
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:07,041
Cooper, you got a boatload
of little snotty-head kids.

177
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:10,041
Go doctor 'em while I figure out
what I'm doing wrong.

178
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,041
I watch her all the time.

179
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:15,625
I... I don't even keep a razor
in my bathroom because...

180
00:08:15,667 --> 00:08:17,125
I watch her,

181
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,333
but she stopped eating.

182
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,333
Barbara's never getting better,
is she?

183
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,333
Jimmy, depression is tough
to break,

184
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:26,041
and treatment is not fast.

185
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,041
Yeah, it's been over a year.

186
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:31,750
I mean, she nursed her father,
we canceled the wedding...

187
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:34,959
I love her, Pete.
I need her better.

188
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,333
Oh, hey. Are you going up
for your appointment?

189
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:41,750
No, i'm... I'm tired
of all the talking.

190
00:08:41,792 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm tired of all the pills.
Um, it's not working.
Barbara--

191
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,250
Jimmy...

192
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:49,166
Barbara made a decision.

193
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:51,166
What decision?
Dr. Turner has a way

194
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:55,041
for me to get better,
to feel happy again now.

195
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:59,250
I'm gonna do
electric shock therapy.

196
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:06,041
This is not the treatment
we agreed on.

197
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,041
Well, the treatment
we agreed on isn't working.

198
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:11,041
She needs a shock
to the system, literally.

199
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,041
What?
What are you doing?

200
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,875
My--my job.

201
00:09:14,917 --> 00:09:16,875
I'm adapting
to Barbara's situation.

202
00:09:16,917 --> 00:09:18,834
I'm altering course.

203
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,834
By sending electrical current
through our patient's brain

204
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,041
and inducing a seizure?

205
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,834
That's a last resort.

206
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,041
It's not "cuckoo's nest."

207
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:27,834
There's no holding her down,
frothing at the mouth.

208
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,834
She's not gonna feel a thing.

209
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,834
It is accepted treatment.
She is desperate.

210
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,834
She wants to be better,
she wants to be better now,

211
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,834
and I can give that to her.
E.C.T. Is not a magic bullet,
and this is not like you.

212
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:40,834
Well, I'm not like me.
You know, this is the new me.

213
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,041
Look, Violet, I know
the trial was rough on you.

214
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,041
You faced your attacker,
and that was--

215
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,166
freeing.
I'm free. I'm great.

216
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,083
But this is not about me.

217
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:52,125
This is about Barbara
and what she needs.

218
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:54,083
Pete,
we have tried everything.

219
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,959
We've tried antidepressants,
acupressure, biofeedback,

220
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,959
exercise therapy, talk therapy.

221
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,041
Nothing's working.
Slow and steady is not working.

222
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,041
Slow and steady takes time.

223
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:06,041
You're the one
that's always preaching that.
Well, maybe I was wrong.

224
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,709
People deserve more, faster.

225
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,667
I asked you to help,
and you did. And thank you.

226
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:14,083
And now if you don't mind,

227
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:19,000
I am taking my new vibrator
and heading home.

228
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,709
I want you
to press this button

229
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,041
whenever you have discomfort,
okay?
Lillie.

230
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:34,041
Dr. Montgomery,
this is Dr. Reynolds.

231
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,041
I'm Brian,
her new oncologist.

232
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:39,166
Addison. I did
the initial resection.

233
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,458
Morphine, huh?
The pain's worse?

234
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,875
Well, hopefully after the chemo,
it should start to subside.

235
00:10:45,917 --> 00:10:48,750
I'm actually
not recommending that.

236
00:10:48,792 --> 00:10:51,583
But if we can give her
a few more months, then...

237
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:55,166
I know you're a surgeon
and you like to fix things,

238
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,625
and Lillie told me
how good you are,

239
00:10:57,667 --> 00:11:00,458
but I think it might be time
to let go.

240
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,041
I think that's not
your call.

241
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,083
No, it's mine.

242
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:08,083
I'm sorry, Addison.
You did your best.

243
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,625
I'm grateful.
But he's right. I've decided.

244
00:11:10,667 --> 00:11:14,041
I think I was
holding on to my life.

245
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,542
But once you agreed
to take Milo,

246
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:19,583
there's no reason to anymore.

247
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:23,333
It's time.

248
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:26,792
Before you yell...

249
00:11:26,834 --> 00:11:28,834
I want to start
with an apology.

250
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:32,041
I wanted to be here yesterday
to introduce you to Dr. Fife,

251
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,125
but my jet was delayed.
We had a deal, William.

252
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:37,333
Hiring was my responsibility,
and you went around me.

253
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,792
You knew that I would object
to his research,

254
00:11:39,834 --> 00:11:41,959
his attitude
and ultimately, his hiring.

255
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,834
I was aware
that you might object

256
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:45,834
to some of his research, yes.
Okay, would object.

257
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:48,250
But he became available. There
were other people interested.

258
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,250
I had to make a decision.
Think of the potential.

259
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,417
Sickle cell, hemophilia,
cystic fibrosis--

260
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,041
his work has the ability

261
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:56,583
to change the face of medicine
as we know it.

262
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:59,667
That's what you and I wanted.
He has no moral center.

263
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:01,709
He supports eugenics.

264
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,458
He wants me to help him
design a baby.

265
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,458
That's what you do, Naomi,
when you weed out for disease.

266
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,583
You're afraid of the slippery
slope, but you're already on it.

267
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,583
Maybe, but I am not
skiing down it.

268
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:15,500
I'm not asking you
to accept him.

269
00:12:15,542 --> 00:12:19,625
I'm telling you...
Find a way to make it work.

270
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:28,166
So there'll be a sedative
running in the I.V.

271
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:30,917
And once I hit the switch,
the current will move

272
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,834
from the left cortex
to the right cortex,

273
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,333
inducing a seizure,

274
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:38,417
which we will monitor
on the e.E.G.

275
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,500
How long will it take?
It'll be over
in a few seconds.

276
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:42,500
And you're not gonna feel
a thing.

277
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:45,333
A few days of observation, I'll
send you home a new woman--

278
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,458
a happier one anyway.

279
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,375
You ready?

280
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,000
I love you.

281
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,667
Okay.

282
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,125
Is that it?

283
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,375
That's it.

284
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:36,041
Well... it looks like
I'm gonna have a cat

285
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,041
for longer than I thought.

286
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:41,291
Your patient...
Chose hospice.

287
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:46,041
She's refusing treatment
and she... is gonna die.

288
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,542
I'm sorry.

289
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,500
She's dying alone.

290
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:54,417
Do you have any chocolate?
We're all out downstairs. Hey.
Hey.

291
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,667
Yes, Sam. I ate it all. Do you
have any chocolate, please?

292
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,291
That's from Halloween.

293
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:06,250
Didn't go well?
Apparently I have the ability
to hire whoever I want.

294
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:09,333
So does he.
Doesn't mean you have to do
what fife's asking you to do.

295
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:12,041
It's still your practice.
Yeah, if he's being
such a jerk,

296
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:15,333
why don't you
just tell him off?
I can't. He's in that chair.

297
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,625
What? I-I know
it doesn't seem right,

298
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:21,166
- but telling off a man who's...
- It feels wrong. Can't.

299
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:24,458
Then I think you should go
to the little people.

300
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,417
No, I'm serious.
They're your patients now.

301
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:30,041
Talk them out of it.
If you think it's wrong,
then convince them.

302
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,667
You're right.

303
00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:34,000
I'll convince 'em.

304
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:42,041
- Go ahead. Take 'em.
- Thank you.

305
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,417
Charlotte.

306
00:14:55,417 --> 00:14:58,583
I understand you've joined
oceanside wellness.

307
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:01,583
Good for you.
It is... good for me.

308
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:04,250
It's allowed me to refocus
my priorities

309
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,000
on to patient care--

310
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,083
something my previous
administrative duties

311
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:10,041
prevented me from doing.

312
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:14,500
Well, it appears it all
worked out for the best.

313
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:19,375
Yes, I've got patients
lining up out the door.

314
00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:21,458
Congratulations
on all your success.

315
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,875
Hi. I was just
keeping Jimmy company

316
00:15:31,917 --> 00:15:33,875
while he waits for her
to wake up.

317
00:15:33,917 --> 00:15:36,083
He's getting coffee.
She's fine.

318
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,500
It went off without a hitch.

319
00:15:38,542 --> 00:15:40,250
Good. That's good.

320
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,250
Mm.

321
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:45,625
Hey. Hey, Barbara.
You're in the hospital.

322
00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:47,875
Everything went well.

323
00:15:47,917 --> 00:15:51,291
How are you feeling?
Oh, I have a headache.

324
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:56,125
But there's nothing pressing
down on my shoulders anymore.

325
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,041
I f--

326
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,208
I feel...

327
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,500
Lighter.

328
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,667
Hi.

329
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:10,583
Wow. Look at you.

330
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,500
Look at that smile.

331
00:16:12,542 --> 00:16:14,500
I missed that smile.

332
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,667
Barb?

333
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:21,583
I'm sorry.
Uh, do I know you?

334
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:30,542
Mild, temporary memory loss is
a common side effect of e.C.T.

335
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:33,750
Mild? She doesn't remember me.
She looked right through me.

336
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:36,625
The memory loss
should resolve in time.
And until then, what do I do?

337
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:38,750
Do I remind her of things

338
00:16:38,792 --> 00:16:42,625
or do I have to keep
my distance?
Look, I-I know
this is scary, Jimmy.

339
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:44,625
But don't expect her
to react to you

340
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:46,542
the way she has in the past.

341
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:49,041
But you can talk to her,
jog her memory.

342
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,000
That may help.

343
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,583
Okay, Violet.

344
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:59,125
Cards on the table--
how bad is this?

345
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:02,542
I don't know.
I don't know, Pete.

346
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:05,959
I mean, it's rare, but sometimes
the memory loss is permanent.

347
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,041
But she seemed good--
her attitude.

348
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,208
I mean, that's a good sign,
isn't it?

349
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,834
It is not a good sign.
That's his fiancée,

350
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,834
and you're saying
she might never remember him?

351
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:17,834
She's happy. That's good
for her. But what about him?

352
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:21,250
I told you
not to rush into this.
I will fix this, okay?

353
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:26,583
I will.

354
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:29,375
Once we start down the road
of choosing characteristics

355
00:17:29,417 --> 00:17:31,041
for our children,

356
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,959
I don't--i don't know
where that ends.

357
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,041
It's not something
that our practice does.

358
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,208
I do want to work with you.
I do.

359
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,667
But, um...

360
00:17:40,709 --> 00:17:43,041
Your daughter?

361
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,667
Uh, yeah.

362
00:17:44,709 --> 00:17:46,417
She's very pretty.

363
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,417
She looks
just like you.

364
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:49,875
Thank you.

365
00:17:49,917 --> 00:17:53,041
You know, I-I-I never really
see the resemblance, but, uh--

366
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,041
of course you don't.

367
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:58,083
You take it for granted--having
a child that looks like you.

368
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:01,041
But what if someone had told you
you couldn't have your daughter,

369
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,917
your own daughter,
who's like you in so many ways?

370
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:06,500
Even if you don't select
for dwarfism,

371
00:18:06,542 --> 00:18:09,333
your child will be
a part of you.

372
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,333
What do you see
when you look at me?

373
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:12,834
I...

374
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:15,333
It's a hard question for
a tall person to answer...

375
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,709
Because all you see
is the dwarf.

376
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,041
No. No, I don't.

377
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:23,041
When I look at Curtis, I see
an accountant, a husband,

378
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,667
and those things
are what our friends see.

379
00:18:25,709 --> 00:18:27,834
If we have a child
who's 5'10",

380
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:31,041
they'll look at him the way
other people look at us.

381
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,875
What if you had a 50/50 chance
of having a white baby?

382
00:18:33,917 --> 00:18:36,750
Would you want a white baby?
N--it's not the same thing.

383
00:18:36,792 --> 00:18:39,834
It is. You'd love
that white baby,

384
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:42,542
but every day, people would
question whether she was yours.

385
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:45,875
They'd whisper like they'll
whisper about our tall child.

386
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:48,875
Would you want that
for your child?
We're not asking you
to clone us.

387
00:18:48,917 --> 00:18:51,000
We're just asking
for what any other parent

388
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,000
would come in and ask for.

389
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:56,625
We want what you have.
How is that crossing a line?

390
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:05,917
You going to stand there
all day

391
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:09,250
or do you have
something to say?

392
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,000
In the wrong hands,

393
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:14,000
genetic engineering can have
terrible consequences.

394
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:17,792
So while you are here,
I'm gonna be the gatekeeper.

395
00:19:17,834 --> 00:19:20,417
That means I set the limits.

396
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,500
If there's gonna be
any slippery slope,

397
00:19:22,542 --> 00:19:26,542
I'm gonna be the one to decide
just how far we slide.

398
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,208
So you're in
with the donovans?

399
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,959
Yes.

400
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,041
Well... don't expect me
to thank you

401
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,750
for doing what's right.

402
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,917
He is just...
He's a little man.

403
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:43,917
I'm sorry. Wheelchair or no,
he is a little man.

404
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:45,709
Oh. What...

405
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,333
What is this?

406
00:19:48,834 --> 00:19:51,333
It's a Christmas angel.

407
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,792
You can take
your kitty caroling.

408
00:19:53,834 --> 00:19:55,041
We're outta here.

409
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,208
Um, th--
This isn't her cat.

410
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,041
This is, uh, for a temporary cat
she's taking care of.

411
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,625
So no caroling.
Okay.

412
00:20:02,667 --> 00:20:04,041
But thank you.

413
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,041
Okay, this place is insane,
all right?

414
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,041
We are in retail purgatory.

415
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:11,208
All because I'm trying to do
a good deed for my patient?

416
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,125
Let's... let's go over here.

458

Uh, what's the name
of your high school?

459
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:01,458
Monklands high.
Prom date?

460
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,041
Eddie Parker. Great prom.
Romance in venice.

461
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,000
Wow.
That--that's impressive.

462
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,000
I didn't think anyone
remembered their prom theme.

463
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:10,083
It was great.
We did it by this pool

464
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,083
with these giant
papier-mâché gondolas.

465
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:15,375
I think I remember because...

466
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:18,917
My dad told me
so many stories about venice.

467
00:22:18,959 --> 00:22:21,959
He went there with my mom
on their honeymoon.

468
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,375
Can you tell me
about his illness?

469
00:22:24,417 --> 00:22:27,375
He--he was just sick
for such a long time.

470
00:22:27,417 --> 00:22:31,083
And he tried to hang on
until...
Until the wedding?

471
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:34,041
What?

472
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:36,083
What wedding?

473
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:38,041
To Jimmy.

474
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:41,166
You and Jimmy
were going to get married.

475
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:43,041
I don't know.

476
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:47,000
I'm sorry. He--he seems like
a really nice guy.

477
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:50,000
I-I really wish
I could remember.

478
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:52,000
She remembers
nothing about Jimmy.

479
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:54,000
She remembers
everything else--everything.

480
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:56,834
Memory loss from e.C.T.
Is not that specific.

481
00:22:56,875 --> 00:23:00,041
Then what is it?
I think the e.C.T. Worked.
I think it unblocked her.

482
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:03,041
I think we got to the root
of her depression.

483
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:06,750
I think the problem is Jimmy.
Something happened with Jimmy,

484
00:23:06,792 --> 00:23:09,375
something so bad
that she blocked it out.

485
00:23:14,417 --> 00:23:16,041
Good morning, Nai.

486
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:17,166
Hey.

487
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:18,792
Oh, I hear you hired
a new doctor.

488
00:23:18,834 --> 00:23:20,458
Whatever.

489
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,625
I'm sorry. No, yes.
A-A doctor has been hired.

490
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:25,166
And he's great,

491
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:28,041
and everything's
going to be great.

492
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:31,041
If you could erase
bad memories,

493
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:33,250
do you think everything
in your life would better?

494
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:37,041
Yeah. There's some things
in my life I'd like to erase.
Yeah, wouldn't we all?

495
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:40,041
Oh, um... say the thing.

496
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:41,875
Oh. Okay.

497
00:23:41,917 --> 00:23:44,041
Violet is not ready
to come back.

498
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:47,625
Do not get your hopes up.
Do not push. Wait.

499
00:23:47,667 --> 00:23:50,542
But she's better.
She's freed or something.
Do--do you want me
to say the thing again?

500
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:52,125
Yeah.
Okay.

501
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:54,417
Violet is not ready
to come back.

502
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:58,041
Do not get your hopes up.
Do not push. Wait.

503
00:23:58,083 --> 00:23:59,500
Okay. Thanks.

504
00:23:59,542 --> 00:24:01,625
Okay. Anytime.

505
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:10,250
White may have hired you,

506
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:13,291
but you work for me,
and as long as you do,

507
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:16,208
you will not withhold
information from me.
Exactly what's the problem?

508
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,583
The embryos that have
the marker for dwarfism--

509
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:21,125
they have a mutation that
the other embryos don't have.

510
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:24,000
It's called v.H.L.
I know what it's called,
and children born with it

511
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:26,000
have a 40% chance
of developing cancer

512
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:28,709
by the time
that they're in their 20s.
It's a nonissue.

513
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:32,041
It's cancer.
And in 20 years,
if these children develop it,

514
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:35,041
my gene therapy treatments
will allow me to cure it.

515
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:38,500
No one can guarantee that.
I can. I did.

516
00:24:38,542 --> 00:24:40,500
What do you mean, you did?
I told the donovans.

517
00:24:40,542 --> 00:24:44,333
They want to go ahead
with the implantation.
They'd rather have a sick,
dwarf child

518
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:46,542
than a tall, healthy one?
Mm-hmm.

519
00:24:46,583 --> 00:24:50,333
The non-dwarf embryos
don't have the mutation.
I told you, it's a nonissue.

520
00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:52,333
Oh, you--i have been
walking around here

521
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:55,208
trying to be polite to you,
but that is it. I am done.

522
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:59,125
You are the most egotistical,
pushy, boorish little man

523
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:02,333
that I have ever met.
Good for you.

524
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:05,208
Excuse me?
You got over your fear
of the wheelchair.

525
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:08,125
That usually takes people
a few months,

526
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:11,125
but you? Less than a week.
I'm impressed.

527
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:14,041
Now if you can just get over
your fear of little people--
shut up!

528
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:17,917
Shut up, you stupid,
horrible, stupid... jerk!

529
00:25:17,959 --> 00:25:19,959
Oh! Okay,
that was kinda lame.

530
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,083
We're still doing
the implantation.

531
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:25,333
No! No, we are not.

532
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:27,333
Okay, we're gonna try
something different.

533
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:29,166
Um, hey, Jimmy,

534
00:25:29,208 --> 00:25:32,959
describe the last fight
you had with Barbara.
Our last fight?

535
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,458
We don't fight.
Well, come on.
All couples fight.

536
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,458
It doesn't have to be
a big thing.

537
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,166
It can be small even.

538
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:41,041
You were always so sad.

539
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:43,166
I-I didn't want
to upset you anymore.

540
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:46,875
Well, how--how about you,
Barbara?

541
00:25:46,917 --> 00:25:49,250
I-I don't want you
to think about Jimmy,

542
00:25:49,291 --> 00:25:53,125
but just describe the last fight
you had with anyone.
Um...

543
00:25:53,166 --> 00:25:55,583
Um, I don't know.

544
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:58,041
Well, like Violet said,
everyone fights.

545
00:25:58,083 --> 00:26:00,458
It's not that. It's just...

546
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:04,083
I'm sorry.
I know you want me to remember,

547
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:07,458
and I want to remember...
Good things.

548
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,166
But to start talking
about fights?

549
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:14,458
I... I've discovered peaches
and the smell of lavender.

550
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,458
And I'm just...

551
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,041
I'm so happy.

552
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:21,917
I don't want to go back.

553
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:24,458
Barbara... please.

554
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,041
You have to try.

555
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:29,041
We were in love.
You loved me.

556
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:30,834
I'm sorry.

557
00:26:30,875 --> 00:26:33,917
You seem so nice.

558
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,792
But...

559
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:44,792
Can I have some more jell-o?

560
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:49,041
So how did you
hear about me?

561
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:51,041
Uh, well, I-I saw you
at a seminar.

562
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:52,417
Great.

563
00:26:52,458 --> 00:26:55,250
There's really no need to be
nervous, Mr. Parker.

564
00:26:55,291 --> 00:26:57,250
Whatever issue you have,
we can talk about it openly.

565
00:26:57,291 --> 00:27:00,333
It's the only way
I'm gonna be able to help.

566
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:03,417
So... how can I help?

567
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:07,333
I love my girlfriend.

568
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:10,959
And I want her
to be happy...

569
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,500
Satisfied.

570
00:27:12,542 --> 00:27:14,000
I understand.

571
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:18,125
But I'm just
a little too quick on, um...

572
00:27:18,166 --> 00:27:20,792
Pulling the trigger?
Well, that's a common problem.

573
00:27:20,834 --> 00:27:24,291
There are many possible
explanations and treatments.

574
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:26,291
We will get
to the bottom of this.

575
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:28,041
And I can guarantee you,

576
00:27:28,083 --> 00:27:31,000
you and your girlfriend
will be satisfied.
Great. That--that's great.

577
00:27:31,041 --> 00:27:34,000
That--that's why I went
online in the first place.

578
00:27:34,041 --> 00:27:37,166
But the more I read,
the more freaked out I got,

579
00:27:37,208 --> 00:27:40,375
then someone in the chat room
suggested you, and, um--
I thought you said
you saw me at a seminar.

580
00:27:40,417 --> 00:27:43,166
Right. After the seminar,
I went to a chat room.

581
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:45,917
I wasn't supposed to mention
the chat room.

582
00:27:45,959 --> 00:27:49,041
Exactly what chat room
are we talking about?

583
00:27:51,417 --> 00:27:53,792
Uh, we don't allow animals
in here.

584
00:27:53,834 --> 00:27:55,333
I'm kidding.

585
00:27:55,375 --> 00:27:56,792
Oh.
I'm impressed.

586
00:27:56,834 --> 00:27:59,333
With this? It is
pretty fabulous, isn't it?

587
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:01,875
No, that you'd bring a cat
for a visit.

588
00:28:01,917 --> 00:28:03,792
It's very nice of you.
Oh.

589
00:28:03,834 --> 00:28:05,792
Maybe you're a cat person
after all.

590
00:28:05,834 --> 00:28:08,041
I know you think
you're paying me a compliment,

591
00:28:08,083 --> 00:28:10,083
but I don't think so.
No?

592
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:12,417
Oh, actually I was hoping
it would flatter you enough

593
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:14,417
that you'd have coffee
with me.

594
00:28:14,458 --> 00:28:16,417
You're asking me out
on a date

595
00:28:16,458 --> 00:28:20,041
as we walk to our
terminally ill patient's room?
I'm an oncologist.

596
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:22,417
I'm always walking to
a terminally ill patient's room.

597
00:28:22,458 --> 00:28:25,166
I ask where I can, when I can
or I'd never get to ask.

598
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:27,542
Yes, to coffee.

599
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:29,041
Okay.

600
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:30,667
Ah, you know what?

601
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,750
Can you just hold this
for a minute?
Sure.

602
00:28:33,792 --> 00:28:36,250
Hey, Milo.

603
00:28:36,291 --> 00:28:39,041
Hello, Milo.

604
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:42,333
There we go.
How's his hair?

605
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:44,041
Perfect.
Okay.

606
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:47,709
Okay, bud.

607
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:58,500
I'm sorry.

608
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:05,417
She's afraid.
Of course she's afraid.

609
00:29:05,458 --> 00:29:07,417
She's feeling good.
She's feeling better.

610
00:29:07,458 --> 00:29:10,041
She doesn't want to lose that.
So how do we break through?

611
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:12,250
We don't.
That's it?
She's blocked out Jimmy,

612
00:29:12,291 --> 00:29:14,250
you think there's
a big mystery about him,

613
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:16,709
and we just give her jell-o?
She found
a magic bullet, Pete.

614
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,291
And what about Jimmy?

615
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:20,291
If you're right about him,
he could be dangerous.

616
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:23,291
If not, then is it fair that he
suddenly becomes nobody to her?

617
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:25,291
I wish I could forget.
I wish I could...

618
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:28,083
Find everything bad that
happened to me and yank it out.

619
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:32,041
I can't. She can. I'm not
gonna take that away from her.
You're the one
that pushed her

620
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:34,333
to get the e.C.T., Violet,
and now she's damaged.
She's better.

621
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:36,041
I don't buy that.

622
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:39,041
And if you're not gonna get
to the truth, I will.
Pete, d--

623
00:29:39,083 --> 00:29:43,041
Barbara... we need to talk
about Jimmy.
Is something wrong?

624
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:45,125
Pete, let her rest.
What's wrong is your memory.

625
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:47,125
Now I know you've been through
a lot and you're feeling better,

626
00:29:47,166 --> 00:29:49,125
but e.C.T. Does not--
Pete--

627
00:29:49,166 --> 00:29:52,583
e.c.t. Does not completely erase
one person from your memory

628
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:54,333
and leave
everything else intact.

629
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:57,041
That's not the way it works.
Th-then...
I don't understand.

630
00:29:57,083 --> 00:29:59,375
If you're blocking Jimmy out,
there might be a reason--

631
00:29:59,417 --> 00:30:01,375
a real reason,
not an e.C.T. Reason--

632
00:30:01,417 --> 00:30:03,458
something he did.

633
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,250
Something that--that--
that you're burying.

634
00:30:06,291 --> 00:30:09,583
Something that--that you've
buried so deeply

635
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:11,125
during the past year

636
00:30:11,166 --> 00:30:14,041
that it might be hard
to talk about.

637
00:30:14,083 --> 00:30:16,333
If Jimmy did something
to you, if you're scared,

638
00:30:16,375 --> 00:30:18,333
we can help protect you.
You can tell us,

639
00:30:18,375 --> 00:30:20,458
and no matter how bad it is,
no matter how awful,

640
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,458
we'll make sure
he never hurts you again.

641
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:27,125
I'm sorry.

642
00:30:27,166 --> 00:30:29,417
Was there something funny
about that?

643
00:30:29,458 --> 00:30:32,125
No, the idea
that Jimmy is dangerous.

644
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,834
You know him. He's...

645
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:38,500
What?

646
00:30:40,667 --> 00:30:41,834
Nice.

647
00:30:41,875 --> 00:30:44,041
You remember Jimmy.

648
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:45,959
I-I woke up feeling better.

649
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,041
I smiled, and then I saw
Jimmy walk through that door,

650
00:30:49,083 --> 00:30:51,041
and I didn't want
to smile anymore.

651
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:53,041
I couldn't just tell him
to go away

652
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:54,291
after everything he's done.

653
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:56,291
But I remember
you telling me

654
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:59,375
that e.C.T.
Can cause memory loss,

655
00:30:59,417 --> 00:31:01,500
so I suddenly realized,
I could forget him.

656
00:31:01,542 --> 00:31:04,792
And then I wouldn't
have to hurt his feelings.

657
00:31:04,834 --> 00:31:07,583
Wouldn't it have been easier
to just tell him?

658
00:31:07,625 --> 00:31:09,166
You're--
you're engaged to him.

659
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:12,166
And for the life of me,
I-I can't figure out why.

660
00:31:12,208 --> 00:31:14,166
When I was depressed,
he--he seemed fine.

661
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:17,166
And he took care of me,
and I really appreciated that.

662
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,875
But after the e.C.T.,

663
00:31:18,917 --> 00:31:20,875
it's like the lights
in my head went on,

664
00:31:20,917 --> 00:31:23,000
and... what was I thinking?

665
00:31:23,041 --> 00:31:25,375
No wonder I was depressed
for such a long time.

666
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:27,375
Don't you think
your father's death

667
00:31:27,417 --> 00:31:29,375
might have had something
to do with that?

668
00:31:29,417 --> 00:31:31,417
Yes, of course.
He liked Jimmy so much.

669
00:31:31,458 --> 00:31:34,166
He used to tell me
all the time,

670
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:36,875
"Barbara, Jimmy--
he's such a nice boy.

671
00:31:36,917 --> 00:31:39,083
He wouldn't hurt a fly."

672
00:31:39,125 --> 00:31:42,583
Sometimes, i--ugh!
I want him to hurt a fly.

673
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:45,583
You get it. Jimmy's that guy--
that guy at the bar

674
00:31:45,625 --> 00:31:47,375
that you go home with
at 3:00 A.M.

675
00:31:47,417 --> 00:31:50,500
Because the guy you really
want to go home with

676
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:53,709
went home with somebody else.

677
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:57,166
Telling him--
it just seems cruel.

678
00:31:57,208 --> 00:31:59,208
I want to spare him.

679
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,625
Isn't this better?

680
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:12,458
I just told off a man
in a wheelchair,

681
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,083
and it felt so good.

682
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:19,041
I may be going to hell,
but I am taking him with me.

683
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:20,291
What's wrong?

684
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:22,041
Lillie died.

685
00:32:22,083 --> 00:32:23,959
I'm sorry.

686
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,959
Alone,
in a tiny room by herself

687
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,542
without family,
without friends...

688
00:32:29,583 --> 00:32:32,834
Addison,
you're not dying...

689
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:35,083
And you're not alone.

690
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:37,083
I know. I have you...

691
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:38,583
And Sam...

692
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:39,875
Yeah.

693
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:41,750
And this practice.

694
00:32:41,792 --> 00:32:46,041
But... god, I am alone.

695
00:32:46,083 --> 00:32:48,458
And I don't know if it's me

696
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,458
or if I have some bad Karma
because I'm a cheater,

697
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,458
but every man I meet,
it's either the wrong person

698
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,125
or the wrong time.

699
00:32:57,166 --> 00:32:59,125
Even the oncologist--
Lillie's oncologist.

700
00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:00,667
He asked me out.

701
00:33:00,709 --> 00:33:02,583
Brian Reynolds?
He's cute.

702
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:05,250
Yes. I said yes.

703
00:33:05,291 --> 00:33:06,959
But I can't, Nai.

704
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,375
I'm a mess.

705
00:33:08,417 --> 00:33:10,750
I'm too screwed up to date.

706
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:17,000
Ugh. And this damn cat
keeps staring at me.

707
00:33:19,959 --> 00:33:22,709
What the hell
were you thinking?

708
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,709
Hey, Dr. King.
I'm with a patient.

709
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,041
A real patient.

710
00:33:26,083 --> 00:33:28,375
Not like that guy you sent me,
the one with the...

711
00:33:28,417 --> 00:33:31,041
You met him in a chat room.

712
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:33,375
My mom doesn't let me
go into chat rooms.

713
00:33:33,417 --> 00:33:35,750
Your mom's right, unless you're
supervised by a grown-up.

714
00:33:35,792 --> 00:33:38,834
I'm a grown-up--
no, he isn't.

715
00:33:38,875 --> 00:33:42,625
I was trying to help.
Don't. I don't need
your pity patients.

716
00:33:42,667 --> 00:33:45,041
Your hesitation

717
00:33:45,083 --> 00:33:48,583
has nothing to do
with the second genetic lesion.

718
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:51,041
Let's call this
what it is.
Yes, let's.

719
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:52,625
Uh, which is what?

720
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:55,041
You won't do the implantation
because you think we're freaks.

721
00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:57,625
You're prejudiced
against little people.

722
00:33:57,667 --> 00:34:00,709
There is nothing I would rather
do than give you what you want,

723
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:04,000
but not like this.
But it's the only way
for us.

724
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:06,041
I understand
what you want--
look at you.

725
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:07,458
How can you
possibly understand

726
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,250
what it's like to be laughed at,
to never fit in?

727
00:34:10,291 --> 00:34:12,875
You're tall and beautiful
and successful.

728
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:15,750
I was fat.

729
00:34:15,792 --> 00:34:18,166
As a kid, I... I was fat.

730
00:34:18,208 --> 00:34:20,500
I don't mean to suggest
that it's comparable,

731
00:34:20,542 --> 00:34:23,166
but everyone has
their own scars to bear.

732
00:34:23,208 --> 00:34:25,166
We all have
our insecurities,

733
00:34:25,208 --> 00:34:27,166
and--and they're painful
and--and persistent,

734
00:34:27,208 --> 00:34:29,041
and they're ours.

735
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:32,792
I don't want to compare
painful anecdotes with you,

736
00:34:32,834 --> 00:34:35,792
I'm just saying, is in some
small way, I do understand.
A small way?

737
00:34:35,834 --> 00:34:38,583
Oh, you know it is really hard
to avoid using words

738
00:34:38,625 --> 00:34:41,458
like "big" and "small"
and "short" and "tall."

739
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,458
We try to say things nicely,

740
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,458
but you--you know,
the fact of the matter is,

741
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,041
I wasn't just fat.

742
00:34:47,083 --> 00:34:49,583
"Fat" is the nice word
for what I was.

743
00:34:49,625 --> 00:34:52,083
I was huge.
I was massive.

744
00:34:52,125 --> 00:34:54,542
Six summers of fat camp.

745
00:34:54,583 --> 00:34:58,250
My whole adolescence
being made fun of.

746
00:34:58,291 --> 00:35:01,709
I have heard every single joke--
"lard-o," and "fat ass"

747
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,959
and, uh, "dumbo"
and "elephant" and--

748
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,959
in our group of friends,

749
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,667
a tall child will be "lurch"
or "giant" or "Godzilla."

750
00:35:08,709 --> 00:35:12,250
But if he's healthy,
he'll survive it.

751
00:35:12,291 --> 00:35:15,041
I did. You did.

752
00:35:15,083 --> 00:35:18,834
But I cannot implant
a sick embryo.

753
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:20,834
No matter
what Dr. Fife promises you

754
00:35:20,875 --> 00:35:24,333
about future breakthroughs,
I cannot do it.

755
00:35:24,375 --> 00:35:28,875
But what I can do is help you
to have a healthy baby.

756
00:35:28,917 --> 00:35:31,375
And whether he is tall
or--or medium or small,

757
00:35:31,417 --> 00:35:34,542
when you hold him in your arms,
he will be yours.

758
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:36,750
And you'll love him.

759
00:35:36,792 --> 00:35:39,792
Isn't that
all that really matters?

760
00:35:39,834 --> 00:35:42,500
That's what I can give you.

761
00:35:48,917 --> 00:35:50,750
Are you Dr. Montgomery?

762
00:35:50,792 --> 00:35:52,667
The hospital told me
I'd find you here.

763
00:35:52,709 --> 00:35:55,583
I'm Iris.
Lillie's second cousin Iris.

764
00:35:55,625 --> 00:35:58,375
Oh, uh, yeah.
Please... come in.

765
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:02,834
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

766
00:36:02,875 --> 00:36:06,083
I didn't realize
that Lillie had any family.

767
00:36:06,125 --> 00:36:08,041
We weren't close.

768
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:11,166
But Lillie called me, asked me
to make the arrangements,

769
00:36:11,208 --> 00:36:13,000
wrap up the loose ends.

770
00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:15,542
Is there anything
that I can do

771
00:36:15,583 --> 00:36:17,792
or do you have
any questions?

772
00:36:17,834 --> 00:36:19,792
Lillie told me
how kind you were.

773
00:36:19,834 --> 00:36:22,500
She told me you offered
to care for Milo.

774
00:36:22,542 --> 00:36:25,834
She wanted me to thank you.
I was glad I could help.

775
00:36:25,875 --> 00:36:29,041
She didn't want to impose
on you any further.

776
00:36:29,083 --> 00:36:30,959
It wasn't her way.

777
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,375
I've come to take Milo
home with me.

778
00:36:54,709 --> 00:36:57,041
Ex-exactly what do you find
so funny?

779
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:59,041
I'm sorry.

780
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:02,041
It's the fact that I
dreamed up this huge trauma

781
00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:05,458
that turned out
to be niceness.

782
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,458
The fact that somebody could
dislike somebody else so much

783
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,834
that she'd pretend
not to remember him...

784
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:12,375
It's not funny.

785
00:37:12,417 --> 00:37:15,375
Oh, I wasn't, you know,
I wasn't gonna tell you this,

786
00:37:15,417 --> 00:37:17,375
but I actually--
I thought that...

787
00:37:17,417 --> 00:37:20,375
I thought that Jimmy
might have killed her father.

788
00:37:20,417 --> 00:37:23,083
Oh, it's sad, isn't it--

789
00:37:23,125 --> 00:37:26,375
the lengths we go to...
People?
Sad for Jimmy.

790
00:37:26,417 --> 00:37:29,875
Oh, poor, nice Jimmy.

791
00:37:29,917 --> 00:37:32,709
We have to tell him.
This isn't right.

792
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,709
You want to break his heart
more honestly?

793
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:38,250
'Cause either way, Barbara
doesn't want to be with him.

794
00:37:38,291 --> 00:37:41,000
Is that how it is for you
with me?

795
00:37:43,083 --> 00:37:45,542
No, don't answer that.

796
00:37:45,583 --> 00:37:48,041
Just don't say what you think,
for once.

797
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:49,709
I don't want to know.

798
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:52,041
Come on, Pete. We're just...

799
00:37:52,083 --> 00:37:54,458
We're laughing.

800
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,000
We're having fun.

801
00:38:00,417 --> 00:38:02,875
So... we lie to Jimmy.

802
00:38:02,917 --> 00:38:04,750
We lie to Jimmy.

803
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:11,834
You're
a very persuasive woman...

804
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:15,041
But not a particularly
far-sighted doctor.

805
00:38:15,083 --> 00:38:18,041
Science is about progress.

806
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:19,709
And ten years from now,

807
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:21,959
these kind of choices
will be commonplace,

808
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
with or without your approval.

809
00:38:24,041 --> 00:38:26,000
There are limits
to what we should do.

810
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:29,000
And I guess here,
you get to decide.

811
00:38:30,583 --> 00:38:32,000
You don't like me.

812
00:38:32,041 --> 00:38:35,375
No. No, I don't.

813
00:38:35,417 --> 00:38:37,041
I didn't like you either.

814
00:38:37,083 --> 00:38:38,792
You're beautiful,
gorgeous, really,

815
00:38:38,834 --> 00:38:41,041
and very,
very annoyingly tall.

816
00:38:41,083 --> 00:38:44,041
But the fact that you were
a big, giant fatty

817
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:46,917
makes me like you
just a little bit now.

818
00:38:46,959 --> 00:38:48,625
There are chinks
in that armor.

819
00:38:48,667 --> 00:38:50,917
Is that supposed to be
a compliment?

820
00:38:50,959 --> 00:38:52,500
Uh, actually, yes.

821
00:38:52,542 --> 00:38:54,750
But don't feel too good
about it.

822
00:38:54,792 --> 00:38:58,000
You got what you wanted today.

823
00:38:58,041 --> 00:39:01,000
But the donovans--they didn't
get what they wanted.

824
00:39:07,458 --> 00:39:09,417
And I'll call you
after I get the results

825
00:39:09,458 --> 00:39:10,917
of the C.T. urogram.

826
00:39:10,959 --> 00:39:12,041
Okay.

827
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:14,041
Hi.
See what I did there?

828
00:39:14,083 --> 00:39:16,041
I didn't barge in
and start yelling.

829
00:39:16,083 --> 00:39:18,041
I waited for you to finish

830
00:39:18,083 --> 00:39:20,041
because I respect you
professionally.
Well, yay for you.

831
00:39:20,083 --> 00:39:22,041
And that wasn't
a pity patient.

832
00:39:22,083 --> 00:39:24,625
That's what, in doctor circles,
is called a referral,

833
00:39:24,667 --> 00:39:27,625
the proper response to which is,
"thank you, Dr. Freedman,

834
00:39:27,667 --> 00:39:30,125
for referring me
this interesting case."
Oh, I'm sorry.
Thank you, Cooper.

835
00:39:30,166 --> 00:39:32,125
Thank you for making me feel
like a failure.

836
00:39:32,166 --> 00:39:35,000
It's not bad enough that
I failed at pacific wellcare.

837
00:39:35,041 --> 00:39:36,208
Now my boyfriend's

838
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,333
wrangling me patients
off a bondage chat room

839
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:41,333
because he doesn't believe
I can get them on my own.
Oh, you know what?
Shut up. Shut up.

840
00:39:41,375 --> 00:39:43,333
You can't reinvent yourself
overnight. It takes times.

841
00:39:43,375 --> 00:39:46,250
And you can't do this all on
your own, and you don't have to.

842
00:39:46,291 --> 00:39:49,667
You're part of a couple now.
We do things together.

843
00:39:49,709 --> 00:39:51,667
