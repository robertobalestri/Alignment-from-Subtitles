Sam's blocking me
from joining the practice.

5
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:18,291
Sam is not blocking you.
Oh, please.
Violet doesn't care right now

6
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:20,834
if you give the partnership
to Godzilla,

7
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:22,834
Addison would say it to my face,
and since I'm paying

8
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:25,041
what you owe,
you'd be a fool to block me.

9
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:27,375
That leaves Sam.
Everybody's really busy,
Charlotte.

10
00:00:27,417 --> 00:00:30,333
We just haven't had time
to discuss it.
You're my man on the inside.

11
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:33,041
Work your magic.

12
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:36,583
Want to play
python in the forest?

13
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:38,583
I'm gonna stand up
very slowly now.

14
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:40,125
Would you let go?

15
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:41,583
You really want me to?

16
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:44,041
No, Charlotte. Come on.
I'm really late.

17
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:46,166
Mm.

18
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:50,667
I want this, Cooper.
I want to join the practice.

19
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:54,041
♪ ...enough, and, baby,
yeah, yeah, yeah ♪

20
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:56,250
I have to go.

21
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:59,250
You feel sick now,
but you get on the stand

22
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:01,250
and just look straight
at the prosecutor--

23
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:03,250
only at him.
That's what I did, okay?

24
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:05,250
Violet, you don't
have to do this

25
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:06,834
if you don't want to.

26
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:08,834
No, I do, I do.
I want to.

27
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:10,083
Okay.

28
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,000
Violet Turner.

29
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:30,208
Hey.

30
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,458
Sorry I'm late.

31
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:49,083
Please raise your right hand.

32
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:51,083
Do you solemnly swear
to tell the truth,

33
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:53,166
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

34
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:03,041
Dr. Turner...

35
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:06,166
It's customary to say "I do."

36
00:02:15,792 --> 00:02:18,333
I can't do this.

37
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,083
I...

38
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:23,291
I can't do it.

39
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:38,000
- Any word on the trial?
- No, not yet.

40
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:40,166
But Violet's on the stand
all day.

41
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:43,041
Oh, uh, I heard back
from Stan Parsons.

42
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:46,583
Ooh, and?
He is happy where he is.

43
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,041
Ugh! Stan really would've
fit in well here.

44
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:52,041
We could use
another ortho guy.
Yeah, well, we could use
any doctor at this point.

45
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:55,041
Look, what if--
just keep an open mind here--

46
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:58,333
what if we just...
Went with Charlotte?

47
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:01,709
You cannot seriously think
that she would fit in here.

48
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:06,083
She's skilled, she's connected,
she's a specialty we don't have.

49
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:08,625
Hey. Wh--

50
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:11,000
what happened?
Why are you back?

51
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:15,208
Wh--

52
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,041
she refused to testify.

53
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:20,041
Oh. Well, did you try
to talk to her about it?
I tried.

54
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,667
Well, she needs support,
Cooper. It's hard.

55
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:24,750
I know it's hard
and I am supporting her,

56
00:03:24,792 --> 00:03:26,750
but she won't talk to me
about it.

57
00:03:26,792 --> 00:03:29,750
She won't talk to me, either,
and she won't talk to Pete,

58
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,959
so looks like it's your turn.

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,959
Well, if she won't talk
to them,

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,208
she's not gonna talk to me.

61
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,208
What the hell
are you doing here?

62
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,875
No, they told us that
you'd left the practice.

63
00:03:41,917 --> 00:03:44,250
- They--they promised us that you'd left the practice.
- Okay.

64
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,250
You people lied to us!
Shh.

65
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:49,041
Zoe, you have this all wrong.
I do not work here anymore.

66
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,000
You screw up
our implantations,

67
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,834
and then you force us to carry
each other's babies--
Zoe, please, just...

68
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:56,041
I'm sorry. Just sit.
I have high blood pressure.

69
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:59,041
That's why you're here?
No.

70
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:02,250
No, the appointment's for me.
Our obstetrician--
thinks there might be
something wrong with the baby.

71
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,041
- Okay, which one?
- Mine.

72
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:07,083
Sorry. The--the baby
that I'm carrying, her son.

73
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:09,417
It gets a little confusing
sometimes.

74
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,875
Dr. Carey said that we needed
a consult--surgical--

75
00:04:11,917 --> 00:04:15,709
and the only one
he'd recommend was you.
Okay, uh, Amelia,
while you're here,

76
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,041
we'll go ahead and get
your blood pressure checked.

77
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,458
Zoe, why don't you
come on back?
Okay.

78
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,041
Okay. Hmm.

79
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,041
I'm sorry that I blew up.

80
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,041
I-I thought I was okay
with everything,

81
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,458
but it--it's been hard.

82
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,875
My pregnancy,
Amelia's pregnancy,

83
00:04:30,917 --> 00:04:35,041
and then seeing Naomi again,
I just...

84
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:38,625
Something is wrong, isn't it?
Give me a second.

85
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:42,125
Dr. Carey deflected
all my questions.
I won't do that.

86
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:46,542
Oh, my god.
What is it?

87
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:49,166
It's a teratoma.
It's a kind of tumor.

88
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,083
Sometimes when the stem cells
differentiate

89
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,083
into cartilage, bone or flesh,

90
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,709
they end up
where they don't belong.

91
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,709
And in this case,
the tumor is large enough,

92
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,041
that it's taking over
the baby's blood supply.

93
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,041
What I'd like to do
is operate,

94
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,166
try to separate the tumor
from the fetus.

95
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:07,041
And will that fix it?
Well, it's not that simple.

96
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,041
Sometimes it works.
Sometimes it doesn't work.

97
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:12,250
But without surgery,
the baby will die.

98
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,250
Well, this is Amelia's
last embryo, so i--

99
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:17,250
I have to tell you
that if I do the surgery,

100
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,250
I'll need to perforate
the uterus.

101
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:22,291
Sometimes that can affect your
ability to carry another child.

102
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,208
I know it's an awful choice.

103
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,291
You'll want to talk it over
with your husband, with Amelia.
Uh, no. Martin left.

104
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:31,291
He never liked it--the having
each other's baby thing.

105
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:35,166
And he--he didn't understand
the bond between Amelia and I.

106
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:37,166
It's--it's like...

107
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:41,125
Both babies
belong to both of us.

108
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:43,041
I can't do it.

109
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,125
Martin will come back,

110
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:48,041
and we--we've always wanted
a big family.

111
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:50,041
I just can't.

112
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:53,041
Well, then I'd recommend
terminating the pregnancy.

113
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:57,667
My god.
What will that do to Amelia?

114
00:05:57,709 --> 00:06:02,041
And i--if we do nothing,
it's gonna die in the womb?

115
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,333
Yes.

116
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,375
Then I think
I should let it

117
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:07,375
and get Amelia further along.

118
00:06:07,417 --> 00:06:10,375
I... I can't have her think
that I just gave up.

119
00:06:10,417 --> 00:06:13,041
I think that it's better
for her to think

120
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,625
that it's an act of god,
whenever it happens.

121
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:20,041
Zoe, this is Amelia's baby.
She has the right to know.
It's in my body,
and I'm your patient.

122
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,125
You can't tell her
without my permission.
Zoe--

123
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:25,000
you can't tell her.

124
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,583
You look like
somebody shredded you.

125
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,583
Did you talk to Violet again?

126
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,583
No, no. I just, uh...

127
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,834
Remind me never, ever
to go upstairs again.

128
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,834
No, I didn't talk to Violet.

129
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,834
I-I didn't know
what to say to her.

130
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,583
You--you gonna have
another run at her?
Nope. I'm done.

131
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:45,917
I tried. I pushed.
I... had no effect on her.

132
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:48,083
So if she wants to let
Katie walk...

133
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:51,709
Pete, Katie is not gonna
walk away from this.

134
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,709
No, but the defense
will line up experts

135
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,291
who will say she was crazy.
Yeah, well, wasn't she?

136
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,583
Not guilty by reason
of insanity is not guilty,

137
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,625
and Katie is guilty.

138
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:03,083
Six months in a nut farm,
some meds, a little therapy--

139
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:06,208
after what she did?
That's unacceptable.
You don't know
how long it's gonna be.

140
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,208
I mean, she--she--she could
be in there for years.
I got on the stand

141
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,667
and told them about the wound,
the blood,

142
00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:14,208
the baby gone,
thinking Violet was dead.

143
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,208
But unless Violet tells the jury
what it was like,

144
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,667
unless they hear it
from her--

145
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:22,875
but if--if Violet is gonna be
too traumatized...

146
00:07:22,917 --> 00:07:26,041
Then she'll just
keep being stuck.

147
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:28,250
She'll never be Violet.

148
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,208
And I'll still have a son

149
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,625
whose mother can't bring herself
to care about him.

150
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:37,125
She's missing everything...

151
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,125
The little sound he makes
when he smiles...

152
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:43,959
The way his eyes try to take in
the whole world at once.

153
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's just gonna take time,
Pete.
Well, she can have
as much as she wants.

154
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,917
I'm done.

155
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:56,583
Cooper put you up to this?
No. We're all concerned
for you, Violet.

156
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,583
Why does it matter
if I testify or not?

157
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:01,458
Why should I have to sit there
and relive it?

158
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,041
Why am I the only person who can
make sure Katie gets punished?
Well, it's not about Katie.
This is about you.

159
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,542
That's right. It's about me.
So sitting there for eight,

160
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:10,291
ten hours a day on the stand
with Katie staring at me?

161
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:13,750
That would be like living
through it all over again.
Aren't you doing that anyway?

162
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:16,959
And don't shrinks always say
it's good to--to talk?

163
00:08:18,542 --> 00:08:21,041
Well, what do shrinks know?

164
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,417
I know facing her
will be hard.

165
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:26,333
Being on the same planet
with her is hard.

166
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:29,333
All right. Well, we could
all chip in and get her

167
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,208
one of those guest trips
to the space station, one-way.

168
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,208
We could probably get a discount
if it's one-way, right?

169
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,041
Dr. Turner, there's someone
here to see you.
Who is it?

170
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:41,333
A Mr. Kent. He says to
tell you he's Katie's father.
Okay, uh,

171
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:44,792
could you give us
a second, please?

172
00:08:44,834 --> 00:08:47,041
All right, Violet.

173
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:50,125
Violet... if you had
a patient in this situation,

174
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:54,166
would you tell your patient
to face it or to run away?

175
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:56,166
All right,
you see that chair?

176
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:59,208
I'm gonna be sitting in it.

177
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,208
If you need help,
you look at me, you blink,

178
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,375
and I'll come riding
to the rescue, okay?

179
00:09:05,417 --> 00:09:08,542
You... you can still blink,
can't you?

180
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,333
Can you...

181
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:13,458
Okay.

182
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:21,083
When Dr. Wilder testified...

183
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:24,291
What he found--
to hear...

184
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,083
It's horrifying.

185
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:30,500
I-I can't apologize
to you enough. Just...

186
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:40,667
You helped her.

187
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:44,083
Well... if that were true,
we wouldn't be sitting here.

188
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:48,875
No. No, she couldn't
stop talking about you,

189
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:51,041
how you just knew.

190
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:54,041
You knew
that all she wanted

191
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,834
was to have her baby
and...

192
00:09:56,875 --> 00:10:01,125
Be not sick anymore.

193
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:04,125
She told me I was
going to be so proud of her.

194
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:08,083
She said, "you'll see, dad.
I'm gonna be just like mom."

195
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:14,542
If that jury
sends her to prison,

196
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:17,208
she'll disappear.

197
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,875
This illness
will eat her alive.

198
00:10:20,917 --> 00:10:23,041
Why are you here?

199
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:26,458
Katie wants to see you.
She wants to talk to you.

200
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,792
She says you're
the only person who understands.

201
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,917
Violet talked to you?
Yeah, I guess
she was just ready.

202
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,875
Yeah, but to you?
Look, do you want to hear
what she had to say or not?

203
00:10:47,917 --> 00:10:49,875
She doesn't want to testify

204
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:52,792
because she's terrified
of facing Katie.
That's the revelation?

205
00:10:52,834 --> 00:10:55,041
We were interrupted.
Katie's father showed up.

206
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:58,041
Why? What did he want?
I don't know.

207
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:01,041
But when he left, she went
and hid in the ladies room.

208
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:04,417
You got a minute?
Uh, yeah.
Just, uh, in one minute.

209
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,792
I was talking to Sam.

210
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:10,625
Oh, we're just in the middle
of a--
it'll only take a second.

211
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,959
I am a damn fine doctor with
an established patient base,

212
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,959
and as I made clear, I have
great ideas for expanding it.

213
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,959
I have the cash to buy in. I'm
chief of staff at St. ambrose,

214
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,959
so I can steer you so many heart
surgeries, you'll beg for mercy.

215
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,542
Why are you stalling?
Because I just don't think
you're--

216
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:29,083
you're the right fit here.

217
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,041
You know,
we're--we're all friends,

218
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:34,750
we--we respect each other,
we get along.
Uh-huh.
I guess that would be why

219
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:37,667
Naomi and Pete couldn't
get outta here fast enough.

220
00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:40,041
We need someone who is
great with patients,

221
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:43,041
someone who's great with staff,
someone's who calm--
oh, you want Naomi.

222
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,041
Okay, I-I don't want
to be mean,

223
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:48,000
but I just don't like you.

224
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,375
Oh.

225
00:11:52,417 --> 00:11:54,375
Well, good grief.

226
00:11:54,417 --> 00:11:57,375
What does that have to do
with anything?

227
00:11:57,417 --> 00:12:00,291
Excuse me.

228
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,875
I need to talk to you
about Amelia and Zoe.

229
00:12:02,917 --> 00:12:04,041
Okay.

230
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,041
This place is
a kindergarten.

231
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,041
If somebody's offering you
something you need,

232
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,083
don't you just grab at it

233
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,041
instead of whining about
your delicate feelings?

234
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,625
What on god's green earth

235
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:15,625
do feelings have to do
with anything?

236
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:18,041
It's good for you
or it isn't. Oh!

237
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:20,250
You agree with me?

238
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,041
Sure.

239
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,041
Something needs doing,
you just do it.

240
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,083
Otherwise, what good are you?

241
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:29,500
It's Amelia's baby.

242
00:12:29,542 --> 00:12:32,208
Ethically, it doesn't matter.
It's in Zoe's body.

243
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,250
Zoe's my patient.
I can't breach confidentiality.

244
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,875
I hate this. I hate that
this baby is sick.

245
00:12:37,917 --> 00:12:41,917
I hate that Zoe won't let me
even try to fix it...

246
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:43,125
That I'm lying to Amelia,

247
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,333
that Naomi's
caught up in this again.

248
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,417
We're all caught up in it.
If this baby dies,

249
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,041
then the settlement
goes out the window.

250
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,041
It's based on these two women

251
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,750
bringing these babies to term
and then switching.

252
00:12:53,792 --> 00:12:56,542
If that can't happen, then we're
facing a malpractice suit.

253
00:12:56,583 --> 00:13:00,792
So, no. Lying to Amelia
will only make it worse.
I know that. I tried to get
Zoe to change her mind.

254
00:13:00,834 --> 00:13:02,834
Look, Naomi knows them--

255
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,834
don't even think it.

256
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:08,333
You saw how hostile Zoe is.
Do not bring Naomi in.

257
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,917
I just meant to ask her--
if litigation starts again,

258
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,959
they smell that
Naomi's been involved--
they'll go after her first.

259
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,917
They'll go after her first.

260
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:20,125
So nobody knows what
Katie's father said to Violet

261
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,375
except Violet,
and she's not talking,

262
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:25,875
except to Sam,
and not about that.
I didn't get a babysitter
to talk about Violet.

263
00:13:25,917 --> 00:13:28,250
All right, what do you
want to talk about?
Anything but that.

264
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,709
Uh, well, we could talk about,
uh, Charlotte, my benefactor.

265
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,709
You upset
because she paid your way?
No. I love being emasculated.

266
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:37,041
Okay, no Violet talk
and no Charlotte talk.

267
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:40,583
You want to bet on the game?
If you lose,
do I collect from Charlotte?

268
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,041
If you could've
seen her face.

269
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:47,041
Who knew Charlotte
had feelings?
Cooper.

270
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:50,750
Thanks. That helps a lot.
You can't tell
your friend's girlfriend

271
00:13:50,792 --> 00:13:53,917
that you don't like her.
I know, I tried...
I tried to dodge her,

272
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:56,917
but she backed me into a corner
and kept on telling me

273
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,625
all the reasons why
we should hire her and--
we should hire her.

274
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:02,709
You don't actually
like her?
I like her check.

275
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,041
I like that hiring her
would make Cooper happy.

276
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:08,041
I like that we would be moving
forward in at least one area.

277
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:11,542
And I like her specialty.
It could be good for business.

278
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:14,250
Look, we have a problem.
She is our solution.

279
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,375
Ugh.

280
00:14:16,417 --> 00:14:18,750
All right, fine.
Let's just get it over with.

281
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:20,250
Addie?

282
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:23,041
Uh, hey, up here.

283
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,959
Oh, I'm interrupting.
Mnh-mnh.

284
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,959
Mnh-mnh. I was
just leaving, really.

285
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,834
Uh, Amelia came to see me
this afternoon.

286
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:32,667
I was surprised, too, given
what happened this morning,

287
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:36,041
but, um, she thinks there's
something wrong with the baby,

288
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,959
and she thinks that you and Zoe
are lying to her about it.

289
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,041
Okay, look, I know
I'm supposed to be out of this,

290
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:45,959
but she--she looks like
she's about ready to explode.

291
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,041
So... is she right?
Are you lying to her?

292
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,875
There is a problem.

293
00:14:50,917 --> 00:14:53,583
That we can't
tell you about.

294
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,834
Okay. How serious is it?
Nai.

295
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:59,041
Can it be corrected?
Is it--
oh, this is ridiculous.
We're playing 20 questions.

296
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,709
They were Naomi's patients,
all right?

297
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,208
Like it or not,
we are all in this together.

298
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,041
We either all sink
or we all swim.

299
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,041
It's a sacrococcygeal teratoma,

300
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:12,083
and it's on the baby
that Zoe's carrying.
Well, can't--can't that
be operated on?

301
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:15,041
I'd like to try,
but Zoe said no.
Well, that can't be
the end of it.

302
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:18,041
Well, look, I know you don't
want me involved--
not a good beginning
of a sentence.

303
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,125
Amelia came to me,
and I have to do something.

304
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,917
I mean, Zoe's mad,

305
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,709
but she was my patient,
and I do know her.

306
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,875
So get me into a room with her
and maybe I can get her

307
00:15:28,917 --> 00:15:31,041
to change her mind.

308
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:34,333
You--you guys
have to let me try.

309
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,000
Thank you for coming.

310
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:09,792
I'm on my meds.

311
00:16:09,834 --> 00:16:11,709
I'm myself.

312
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,917
I've heard that.

313
00:16:18,792 --> 00:16:20,750
So you wanted to see me?

314
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:23,083
I...

315
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,834
How are you?

316
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:33,041
Oh, d-Dr. Turner,
I am...

317
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,917
I'm--I'm so sorry.

318
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:39,917
Please... tell me you know it
wasn't me who did that to you.

319
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:41,917
Please tell me you know that.

320
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,208
Why?

321
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,208
So that I'll know
you understand

322
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,125
that I'm not a monster.

323
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:49,625
That's why you wanted
to see me?

324
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:52,208
That... and I want you
to testify.

325
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,041
When Dr. Wilder
was on the stand,

326
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:58,750
the jury looked at me
like I am a monster.
And you think my testimony
would counteract that?

327
00:16:58,792 --> 00:17:01,166
I think if you testify,
the jurors will know--

328
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:03,625
they will know
that I was crazy that night.

329
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:06,041
And you'll avoid prison.
I won't get help in prison.

330
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,041
I'll slip.
I'll be crazy again.

331
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,041
I-I don't ever want
to be crazy again.

332
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:13,000
I'm scared.
I'm scared of that...

333
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,625
That person--
that person who did that.

334
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,667
It's...

335
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:19,834
It's not about
avoiding punishment.

336
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:22,959
It's just...
I need--i need help.

337
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,125
I need someone on my side.

338
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:31,041
You--you--you--you--

339
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,208
you gutted me like a pig.

340
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,250
You ripped
my baby out of my body.

341
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:38,250
You left me there
to bleed to death,

342
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,834
and now I should be
on your side?

343
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:44,709
I should care
about how sorry you are?

344
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,709
I should give a damn
about what happens to you?

345
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,709
You made my life hell.
You made me crazy.

346
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:55,083
And now you want
a free pass from me?

347
00:17:57,625 --> 00:18:00,375
Please, Dr. Turner.

348
00:18:00,417 --> 00:18:02,667
Please!

349
00:18:02,709 --> 00:18:06,041
Dr. Turner, please!

350
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:16,667
Thank you
for agreeing to see me.

351
00:18:16,709 --> 00:18:18,667
I know how angry you are,

352
00:18:18,709 --> 00:18:21,625
and, uh, how much you blame me,
and rightfully so--
I don't want your apologies.

353
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,041
Dr. Montgomery said

354
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:26,083
that you had something
that you needed to say to me,

355
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:29,041
so why don't you just say it?
Amelia came to see me.

356
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,041
You told Amelia?

357
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,041
No, I told you I wouldn't.

358
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:36,041
Amelia came to me. She knows
you're hiding something.

359
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:39,625
She knows that there is
something wrong with the baby.
So now you want to atone

360
00:18:39,667 --> 00:18:42,875
by talking me into something
that I don't want to do?
Zoe, listen,
when all this happened,

361
00:18:42,917 --> 00:18:45,875
I did not want to talk you
into keeping the baby.

362
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:48,750
All I wanted was for you
to see things from all sides.

363
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:50,041
It was not about me.

364
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,041
This was so you could feel

365
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,458
as okay with what
was going to happen

366
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,041
as you possibly could
given what we did to you--

367
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:01,041
given what I did to you,
what I did to you.

368
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,917
I wasn't the one
who changed your mind.

369
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:05,875
It was Amelia
and it was you,

370
00:19:05,917 --> 00:19:07,875
knowing that it was
the best thing

371
00:19:07,917 --> 00:19:09,875
given the circumstances.

372
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:12,041
If the situation were
the other way around,

373
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:14,041
wouldn't you want
to know, Zoe?

374
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:17,083
Don't you see?
It is the other way around.

375
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:20,709
This is my baby, too.
They're both mine.

376
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,709
They're both hers.
If I tell her now--

377
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,709
tell her that I am going to
end this pregnancy--

378
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:28,417
it will be bad for her--
her blood pressure.

379
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,750
She's already at risk
for eclampsia.

380
00:19:30,792 --> 00:19:33,041
I may lose both babies.
We'll lose both.

381
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:38,083
Or I could do the surgery,
at least try.

382
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:46,917
Okay, if you're gonna choose
not to have the surgery,

383
00:19:46,959 --> 00:19:49,959
then you're gonna have to let
Addison end the pregnancy.

384
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,375
If you ever want to be pregnant
again, it is the safest choice.

385
00:19:52,417 --> 00:19:55,458
And that means...
Telling Amelia.
Okay, I'll tell her.

386
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,667
But you have to explain to her
why the surgery can't be done.

387
00:19:58,709 --> 00:20:01,041
You cannot put that on me.

388
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,375
About Charlotte...

389
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,959
She was in a bitch of a mood
when I got home last night.

390
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,959
Cooper, I'm sorry.
I don't want your apology.

391
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,041
Just make a decision
one way or another.

392
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,125
Is she in or is she out?
Come on.

393
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,750
We did. Yeah, we called her
this morning.

394
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:22,500
She... she didn't tell you?

395
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:26,041
Uh, no. I left early for rounds.
What is it, yes or no?

396
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:29,959
She's moving in to Pete's
old office right now.

397
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:36,458
You coulda called me.

398
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,041
Congratulations.

399
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,583
I wanted to surprise ya.

400
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,625
Uh, just anywhere
except for that one.

401
00:20:41,667 --> 00:20:44,041
It goes on the desk.

402
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:46,041
Wow.

403
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:47,458
This is, uh,

404
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,667
this is gonna be great.

405
00:20:49,709 --> 00:20:53,041
Wait till you see what I got
going on in here.

406
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,083
Um, is this what I think
it is?

407
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:58,208
Yes.

408
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,709
What is this for?

409
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,041
I mean, why is it here?

410
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,458
New job, new specialty.
Porn shop?

411
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,041
Sexual dysfunction.

412
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,458
You're a urologist.

413
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,125
That and now more. Look.
I hired a web designer.

414
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:15,125
You'll be able to click on
a condition, get information.

415
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,959
You can do
an e-mail consultation,

416
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,041
you can order stuff, you can
make an appointment to come in.
This didn't happen
since last night, right?

417
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:23,667
You been thinking about
this one for a while?
Yes.

418
00:21:23,709 --> 00:21:26,041
You didn't think
to mention this to me?

419
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,709
It just slipped your mind?
It's a work in progress.

420
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,041
And what do you call it? What,
is it, like, uh, genitology?

421
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,959
Can't-function-ology?
Sexology.

422
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,583
Is that what it's gonna say
on your business card--

423
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:38,041
Dr. Charlotte king,
sexologist?

424
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:41,166
Kinda sounds a little bit like
a hooker or a dominatrix.

425
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:43,166
You did not just call me
a hooker.

426
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:46,166
No, I said it sounds
a little bit like a hooker.
For god sakes, Cooper.

427
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:48,875
This is a legitimate
medical specialty.

428
00:21:48,917 --> 00:21:51,583
Really, this?

429
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,125
How old are you?

430
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:55,583
Some people
have trouble with sex.

431
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:58,041
They need a doctor's help.
I emphasize "doctor."

432
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,375
You know what?
Um, let's table this.

433
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,166
Violet Turner.

434
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:07,041
All right, pick a fist.

435
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:09,041
Come on. Pick a fist.

436
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:13,041
Oh, good. Yes. See? That means
you have to answer one question.

437
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:16,041
You still don't want
to talk to me?
No, it's--it's not that.

438
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:18,041
I'm just afraid
you're gonna pressure me

439
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:21,041
into doing something
I don't want to do.
Yeah, but Sam--
you talked to Sam.

440
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:23,041
No pressure.
I will not pressure you.

441
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:25,834
Promise.

442
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,500
Okay.

443
00:22:27,542 --> 00:22:29,542
What's the question?

444
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:33,125
Why... did Katie's father
come in to see you?

445
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:36,083
To tell me that
Katie wants to see me.

446
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:39,375
And did he really think
you were gonna go?
I did go.

447
00:22:39,417 --> 00:22:41,583
I thought that...

448
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:45,041
If I could face her--
just us--

449
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:47,041
then I could face her
in the court.

450
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:49,959
Why didn't you tell me?
I would've gone with you.

451
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,583
How'd it go?

452
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:54,750
I wanted to rip her lungs out,
but the deputy was there.

453
00:22:54,792 --> 00:22:58,166
Well, that's probably
a good thing... for Katie.
She wants to me testify.

454
00:22:58,208 --> 00:23:00,417
She wants me to say
that she's crazy.

455
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:04,083
And... what do you want?

456
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:08,458
Well, Dr. Turner thinks
she needs help.

457
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,041
But Violet wants her dead.

458
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:13,458
You can have conflicting
emotions about a person.

459
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,250
I speak from experience.

460
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:18,500
Yeah, but only one of us
can testify.

461
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:23,750
What should I do?

462
00:23:25,834 --> 00:23:29,458
Well, I think Dr. Turner's
the best psychiatrist I know.

463
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,000
But I want
what's best for Violet.

464
00:23:35,417 --> 00:23:38,375
The teratoma depletes
the baby's blood supply,

465
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,417
and the fetus can't develop
or thrive.

466
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:43,667
And the baby dies?

467
00:23:43,709 --> 00:23:46,083
Amelia, I wanted to tell you.
I was--
and is--

468
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:48,917
is there anything that we can do
except for the surgery?

469
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:51,083
I wish there were.

470
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:54,417
If I thought
that there was a way--
no, I understand. I do.

471
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:57,041
Okay.
I do.

472
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:58,917
Amelia.
Uh-huh.

473
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:01,000
Are you okay?
I'm okay.

474
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:03,041
I'm just--I'm a little
light-headed, I think.

475
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:06,750
I'm gonna go ahead and take
your blood pressure now, okay?
Okay.

476
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:11,083
When we--when we first found out
we had the wrong babies,

477
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:12,875
I was afraid.

478
00:24:12,917 --> 00:24:16,500
I was afraid that you wouldn't
try to make it work.

479
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:19,125
Thank you for trying.

480
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,333
So what do we do now?

481
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:26,125
I think termination
is best.

482
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:28,917
I want to be there.

483
00:24:28,959 --> 00:24:31,041
I--I'm sorry.
No.

484
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:33,667
I-I know--i know
this must be hard for you

485
00:24:33,709 --> 00:24:36,250
if you--if you feel--if you feel
anything like the...

486
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:39,000
Like the way that i--
that I feel...
Amelia.

487
00:24:39,041 --> 00:24:42,083
Her pulse is weak and thready.
Get 4 liters of oxygen going.
It's all right.
It's all right...

488
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:44,291
I'm gonna get an I.V. Pack.
You just breathe.

489
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:46,291
Okay, okay.
Okay, just breathe.
Okay? Breathe.

490
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:48,333
All right, lean back.
Lean back. Slow breaths.
I'm okay.

491
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:53,500
Is the baby okay?

492
00:24:53,542 --> 00:24:55,333
Yes.

493
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:58,333
You just had a transient rise
in blood pressure.

494
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:01,625
It slowed your heart down,
but you're okay now.
Oh, thank god.

495
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,542
I am such a mess.

496
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:05,542
You just need to avoid stress

Mm.

Of course she is.
I'll go get her.

Amelia's gotta be careful,

Yes.

And you felt it was safe for her
to stop taking her medications?

663
00:33:37,959 --> 00:33:41,208
She refused to take them.
She was afraid

664

that they would harm the baby

00:33:44,625 --> 00:33:47,834
that required medication?
I understood that she could
benefit from medication.

666
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:50,166
Did she understand
that she would benefit--
objection. Speculation.

667
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:53,041
Your honor, the witness
is not just a victim.

668
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:54,875
She was the defendant's
psychiatrist.

669
00:33:54,917 --> 00:33:57,417
She's an expert
in mental aberrations.

670
00:33:57,458 --> 00:33:59,834
I'll allow it.

671
00:33:59,875 --> 00:34:02,041
Were you aware that without
proper medication,

672
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:05,542
your patient would likely
lapse into a delusional state?

673
00:34:05,583 --> 00:34:08,625
L-Likely is not quite
the right word.
All right.

674
00:34:08,667 --> 00:34:11,000
Do you think it was possible
for her to become delusional?

675
00:34:11,041 --> 00:34:13,542
Your honor, counsel is trying
to blame the victim

676
00:34:13,583 --> 00:34:16,041
for not being clairvoyant.
I'll rephrase.

677
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:18,792
Dr. Turner,
in your expert opinion,

678
00:34:18,834 --> 00:34:22,834
on the night in question,
was the defendant delusional?

679
00:34:31,834 --> 00:34:33,166
Yes.

680
00:34:36,667 --> 00:34:39,250
Yes, she was.

681
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:04,041
Dr. Turner.

682
00:35:08,792 --> 00:35:11,041
I hate what you did to me.

683
00:35:11,083 --> 00:35:13,834
So do I.

684
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:17,083
So why?

685
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:19,417
Because you were right.

686
00:35:19,458 --> 00:35:22,917
It wasn't you that night.

687
00:35:22,959 --> 00:35:27,458
If I had said
you were just...

688
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,959
Evil...

689
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,375
It would be like denying
everything I do.

690
00:35:33,417 --> 00:35:35,375
More than anyone,

691
00:35:35,417 --> 00:35:39,041
I'm supposed to understand
that you weren't you.

692
00:35:39,083 --> 00:35:42,000
And I do understand.

693
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:46,792
Because I'm not me either.

694
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:52,166
I hope you get better.

695
00:35:53,792 --> 00:35:56,625
I hope you get better, too.

696
00:36:00,875 --> 00:36:02,750
Perfect.
You give her our baby,

697
00:36:02,792 --> 00:36:06,041
she walks away,
and there's nothing we can do.

698
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:09,041
God knows what she's
gonna do to him.
She's not gonna hurt
the baby, Martin.

699
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:13,417
She stole our baby.
How can you be this calm?
Calm? I just lost a baby.

700
00:36:13,458 --> 00:36:17,333
And we're gonna find her
and we're gonna get it back.
Martin, I wasn't talking
about that baby.

701
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:20,417
I was talking about the one
I was carrying.
Her baby.

702
00:36:20,458 --> 00:36:23,041
Hers. Mine. I-I know it's
hard for you to understand,

703
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:26,333
but when a child grows inside
you, you feel like it's yours.

704
00:36:26,375 --> 00:36:28,166
You're defending her?
I'm understanding her.

705
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:30,458
Martin--
what? What are you
gonna say now?

706
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,458
Because you know
the settlement's out the window.

707
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,375
This was never about that,
Martin, for either of us.

708
00:36:35,417 --> 00:36:38,417
Martin--
what? That's our baby.

709
00:36:38,458 --> 00:36:40,333
And we'll get him back.
We will.

710
00:36:40,375 --> 00:36:42,834
She's a good person, Martin.

711
00:36:42,875 --> 00:36:45,792
She'll look at him, and she'll
know the right thing to do.
How can you excuse her?

712
00:36:45,834 --> 00:36:47,792
You rush in here
after months of being away,

713
00:36:47,834 --> 00:36:49,792
and you're just happy
that I'm okay.

714
00:36:49,834 --> 00:36:52,125
But Amelia was there for me
through the hardest thing

715
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:54,125
that I have ever done.

716
00:36:54,166 --> 00:36:57,583
She tried to make me feel better
when her baby died.

717
00:36:57,625 --> 00:36:59,458
Martin, you're my husband,

718
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:03,291
and I love you, and I am
so glad that you're back,

719
00:37:03,333 --> 00:37:05,250
but she is my friend, okay?

720
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:07,041
And I know--

721
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:10,000
I know that that is gonna
mean something to her.

722
00:37:19,041 --> 00:37:21,625
Just watched Violet testify.
She did great.

723
00:37:21,667 --> 00:37:24,417
Calm, focused--
she just said what happened,

724
00:37:24,458 --> 00:37:27,458
that hell that happened
to her.

725
00:37:29,208 --> 00:37:31,166
And then she told the jury

726
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:34,625
that Katie was not
mentally responsible.

727
00:37:34,667 --> 00:37:37,291
I don't think
I coulda done that.

728
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,333
