00:00:03,291 --> 00:00:05,083
♪ Ohhh ohhh ohhh ♪

2
00:00:07,583 --> 00:00:11,083
Okay, are you ready
to roll, Mr. Hagen?

3
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:13,542
I think god's kind of
pissed off at me.

4
00:00:13,583 --> 00:00:16,625
I crashed the car.
Well, let's not worry
about the car.

5
00:00:16,667 --> 00:00:19,291
Let's just worry about
getting you put back together

6
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:22,333
in one piece.
Yeah, but... it's not
just the car.

7
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:24,667
I... I screwed up.

8
00:00:24,709 --> 00:00:26,667
Well, everybody screws up.
God knows that.

9
00:00:26,709 --> 00:00:29,959
You're gonna be fine. He put you
on my table, didn't he?

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,375
He must have some idea
what he's doing.

11
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:40,000
They page you a lot?

12
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:42,375
They page me when a helicopter
lands at my hospital.

13
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:45,375
Yeah, but if a helicopter
hadn't landed at your hospital,

14
00:00:45,417 --> 00:00:47,375
you wouldn't have found
some other reason

15
00:00:47,417 --> 00:00:50,375
to call it a night,
you know?
You think I faked
a helicopter landing

16
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:52,375
to bail on our date?
No, no, but--

17
00:00:52,417 --> 00:00:55,041
you want to bail on a date,
you fake a headache

18
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:57,208
not a 2-ton flying machine
that can be seen

19
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,375
from miles away.
Right, right.
I just wanted to make sure.

20
00:01:00,417 --> 00:01:02,041
Sheldon,
the insecurity thing?

21
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:04,166
You want me to stop
thinking about Cooper,

22
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:07,041
stop acting like him.
I'll wait.

23
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:09,917
Maybe you'll be done in
a few minutes and, uh... okay.

24
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:12,166
I need hand and wrist film,
please.

25
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:14,917
What have we got? Maya?

26
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:18,208
And Dell. M.V.A.
She's in labor. Uh,
we were on our way here,

27
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,375
and some guy blew through
a red light.
Good lord.

28
00:01:20,417 --> 00:01:22,375
Her contractions
are two minutes apart,

29
00:01:22,417 --> 00:01:24,375
pain at a seven,
maybe eight.
Sir, you need to sit down.

30
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,375
I'm fine, okay? Maya's--ow.
Sit down. He okay?

31
00:01:26,417 --> 00:01:28,959
So far, some lacerations,
probably a fractured wrist.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,041
We need a fetal doppler,
and where is radiology?
How you feeling, sweetheart?

33
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:35,417
I'm okay. The contractions
were pretty bad,

34
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:38,041
but it's much better now
with the epidural.

35
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:41,041
What epidural? Dell?

36
00:01:46,542 --> 00:01:50,041
Maya... how's that feel?

37
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:52,041
What?

38
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:54,250
I'll page neuro surg.

39
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:57,041
Call Amelia.
She doesn't work here.

40
00:01:57,083 --> 00:02:00,041
Call Amelia. Sam's in the O.R.
Nai's on her way.

41
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:02,583
She knows about the labor,
but nothing else.
Addison, did she break--

42
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:05,875
Dell, sit down. I need a C.T.
of her spine. Now, please.

43
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,792
Hey.

44
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:18,000
We don't have films yet.

45
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:20,000
But she's got
some distal sensory loss.
What?

46
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:22,000
She can't feel her legs.
She fractured her spine?

47
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,375
We don't know
what it means yet.
It means
she fractured her spine.

48
00:02:24,417 --> 00:02:27,458
Pete--
Charlotte, you are sweating
and you are not a sweaty girl.

49
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,667
Is Maya gonna be all right?
Naomi's gonna blow in
any minute

50
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:33,041
expecting contractions and heavy
breathing. Can we focus on that?

51
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:35,417
Now go. Sam's got a body open
in O.R. two.

52
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:38,291
I got another cardiac surgeon on
his way, but it's gonna take him

53
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:40,792
about a half an hour
to get here.
I got it.

54
00:02:40,834 --> 00:02:42,709
Hi.
Not now.

55
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,917
What do you mean, "not now"?
I called you, I texted you.

56
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,917
I tracked you down.
Jan in reception said

57
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,500
there was a helicopter here,
which I can't believe I missed.

58
00:02:49,542 --> 00:02:51,917
But I just need a moment
of your time.

59
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:53,917
I think we should
have dinner tomorrow night--
uh, no.

60
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:55,291
Sheldon.
Excuse me.

61
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,792
Cooper--can you just tell him
what's going on?

62
00:02:57,834 --> 00:03:00,041
I'd rather not, frankly.
What the hell?

63
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:02,041
Hey, Nai, Naomi.
Hey. Maya's in labor.

64
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,041
Yeah.
Oh, she's in labor.

65
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,625
Oh, and i'm--
I'm hyperventilating.

66
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:07,750
I think I'm a little bit
of a hypocrite,

67
00:03:07,792 --> 00:03:09,750
because I've been against this
from the get-go,

68
00:03:09,792 --> 00:03:11,750
but now all of a sudden,
I am just sieged

69
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,750
with the urge to just, like,
knit booties and coo.

70
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,750
I mean, I don't even knit.
So maybe I'm more sieged

71
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:18,750
with the urge to just go out
and by a bunch of booties.
Nai, Naomi--

72
00:03:18,792 --> 00:03:20,750
I think the universe
is actually giving me

73
00:03:20,792 --> 00:03:22,750
a little bit of
a-a break today.

74
00:03:22,792 --> 00:03:24,750
You know, Gabriel is giving
William the a.L.S. Treatment.

75
00:03:24,792 --> 00:03:26,750
William is taking
the a.L.S. Treatment.

76
00:03:26,792 --> 00:03:28,750
I j--i just feel like
it's my day.

77
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:31,750
The universe is gonna tolerate
just a little bit of hypocrisy

78
00:03:31,792 --> 00:03:35,166
from me and let me--
Naomi, Naomi.
Something has happened to Maya.

79
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,583
Oh, my god.

80
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,583
She's got
peripheral anesthesia,

81
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,792
possible fracture
at l-2 or 3.

82
00:03:44,834 --> 00:03:47,166
Okay. Well,
is the cord transected?
I don't know.

83
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:50,208
What about the baby?
I'm gonna do a c-section.
We're going in now.

84
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,250
The O.R.'s ready.
Naomi, I am so sorry.

85
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:55,000
Dell, you didn't do this.

86
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,375
Mom, I can't feel my legs.
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

87
00:03:57,417 --> 00:03:59,375
Mommy's here.
Where's daddy?

88
00:03:59,417 --> 00:04:02,166
Hang in there, Maya, okay? We're
gonna go have your baby now.

89
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,792
Let's go. Now.
Let's go.

90
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,875
Hey. You got nothing better
to do on a Friday night?

91
00:04:16,917 --> 00:04:19,875
I need you for a quick consult.
Can you step out for a sec?
It could be a while.

92
00:04:19,917 --> 00:04:21,875
This guy avulsed
his pulmonary artery,

93
00:04:21,917 --> 00:04:25,208
smashed his beemer,
smashed his rib cage.

94
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,041
He thinks
god's pissed off at him.

95
00:04:32,667 --> 00:04:34,625
That's the guy
that hit Maya and Dell--

96
00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:37,917
on Sam's table
under Sam's knife.
I know that.

97
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,917
Does Sam?
What am I supposed to do?

98
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,917
We can't duct tape
the guy closed.

99
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:44,083
Sam's gotta keep operating
till Mason gets here.

100
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:46,959
Well, you got a better idea?

101
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,041
C-sections are bad.

102
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,041
I wanted to have him
the regular way.

103
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,041
Oh, c-sections
are not bad.

104
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,041
They are fast
and they're safe.

105
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,041
Addison has done
a gajillion of these.

106
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,083
She could do this
in her sleep.
You just focus on the fact

107
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,667
that you're gonna see
your baby, Maya.

108
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:11,458
Okay. There we go.

109
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,500
You got
a nice-looking uterus, kid.

110
00:05:13,542 --> 00:05:16,041
Ew.
All right. Lap pad.

111
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,750
What happened?

112
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:27,083
Her pressure's dropping.
Open up her I.V.

113
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:30,709
Wh-why is
her pressure dropping?
I don't know.
Run the fluids wide open.

114
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,417
Maya. Maya!
B.P.'S down
to 80 over 30.

115
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,333
What--what-- what did you?
I tilted her uterus. I was
checking the baby's position.

116
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:39,291
Well, is she bleeding out?
I don't kn--Naomi,
you need to get out of here.

117
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,041
Dell, get her out of here.
Naomi--

118
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,291
do not touch me.
Uterus must have been
tamponading

119
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:46,041
the radicular artery.
I can't move the baby

120
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,917
or she'll bottom out.
Addison, her pressure
is dropping. You're losing her.

121
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:51,500
Naomi, you need to get out
of here or you shut up.

122
00:05:51,542 --> 00:05:54,333
The baby stays in.
We need to pack the wound.
Tachy at 140. We're
not picking up her pressure.

123
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:57,041
Okay, full pressors.
Pull the crash cart.
Maya, stay with me.

124
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,417
Baby, stay with me. Okay?
You stay with me.

125
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:08,667
How long can the baby
stay in once--
not very long.

126
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:14,000
Let's just wait and see
what Amelia has to say, okay?

127
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,125
I almost lost her.

128
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,625
I know.

129
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:23,125
I'm here.
I'm late. I'm late. I'm sorry.

130
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:27,500
But I got the camera,
so she can start pushing.

131
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:29,667
What?
Was it a false alarm?

132
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:31,875
What?

133
00:06:37,542 --> 00:06:40,041
I was just
gonna come find you.

134
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,667
I, uh, set up the drip
in Pete's office.

135
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:45,291
You can lie there and stare
at all those jars,

136
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:48,500
wonder what the hell
he does with 'em.
We're not going to do
the treatment.

137
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:52,583
You're gonna go to the hospital,
and I'm going to sun valley.

138
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,583
Naomi's daughter
was in a car accident.

139
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:57,500
She may have broken
her back.
What?

140
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,500
You mocked me
for having three assistants,

141
00:06:59,542 --> 00:07:01,667
but when you have
three assistants,

142
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:03,625
you know what's going on.

143
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:06,041
Valerie's the best one
of the lot.

144
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:09,041
You should use her
when I'm gone.
What are you--
what are you talking about?

145
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,750
The treatment won't work.
You know that.

146
00:07:11,792 --> 00:07:14,041
It's too late.

147
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:17,709
You couldn't tell that
to Naomi?

148
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,625
She needed something
to hope for.

149
00:07:20,667 --> 00:07:22,500
What's in sun valley?

150
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:26,041
A daughter
who doesn't like me

151
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:29,417
and who I don't understand.

152
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:32,333
And what, you're just
gonna go there to die?

153
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:40,083
You're not even
gonna say good-bye to her?

154
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:43,125
Tell her the--the drugs
are helping.

155
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:46,583
Tell her I'm resting,
that she shouldn't bother me.

156
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,166
And when Maya's
out of the woods,

157
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,917
tell her I left...

158
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,792
And I love her.

159
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,333
You love her, too,
don't you?

160
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:13,125
Be a better man
than you have been.

161
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:26,917
It's gonna be a long night.

162
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:29,500
I could stop by your house
and pick up some clothes.

163
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,500
Nah, I got some clothes
back in my office.

164
00:08:31,542 --> 00:08:34,083
I just haven't had a second
to put 'em on yet.

165
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,792
Thanks, though. You're sweet.
I'm not.

166
00:08:36,834 --> 00:08:40,500
But under the circumstances,
I'm willing to fake it.

167
00:08:40,542 --> 00:08:43,000
I gotta--
yeah.

168
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:46,834
Hi, guys.
Hey.

169
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,041
Hey.

170
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:50,333
Hey, uh, Lucas
is with Danielle,

171
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:53,125
the sitter from up the street
I told you about with the hair.

172
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,750
Anyway, she's at the house.

173
00:08:54,792 --> 00:08:56,750
She knows it's gonna be
a long night.
Okay.

174
00:08:56,792 --> 00:08:59,041
I would've told you earlier,
but with all the confusion--

175
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,667
I'm sorry.
You don't have to explain
anything to me, Pete.

176
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:04,041
I kinda do.

177
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,667
It's co-parenting.

178
00:09:05,709 --> 00:09:09,041
That's what we're doing.
I tell you where the kid is.

179
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:11,625
It's not a hardship.

180
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:13,208
Well, thank you.

181
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,917
I'm gonna go wait for Sam.

182
00:09:18,834 --> 00:09:20,792
See right there?
Fracture at l-2

183
00:09:20,834 --> 00:09:23,375
and then another chard of bone
here at l-3.

184
00:09:23,417 --> 00:09:25,375
The baby was stabilizing
the whole area,

185
00:09:25,417 --> 00:09:29,375
so when you shifted the uterus,
all hell broke loose.
So what are our options?

186
00:09:29,417 --> 00:09:31,875
Well, Nai, how about
you grab a cup of coffee,

187
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:35,041
and we can talk
about it a little--
just answer the question.

188
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:37,709
Nai, I think that Amelia
wants to brainstorm a little.

189
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,709
So it's--it's easier when
the mother's not here--
well, i-I'm sorry
if this is difficult for her.

190
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,041
Just stop managing me.
Spit it out.

191
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,041
Okay.

192
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,333
If we take out the baby,
the cord strokes out.

193
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,500
She's paralyzed from
the waist down for life.

194
00:09:50,542 --> 00:09:53,041
If I decompress the cord
anteriorly,

195
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,750
we could lose the baby.

196
00:09:54,792 --> 00:09:57,125
If I do a posterior approach,
we could lose the baby.

197
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,542
If I try to repair
the artery first, she could

198
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,959
bleed out on the table,
and I kill them both.

199
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Does anybody have
a preference?

200
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,500
That guy's blood won't clot
for love or money.

201
00:10:12,542 --> 00:10:14,500
Thank you.
Walk with me.

202
00:10:14,542 --> 00:10:16,500
Five minutes while they
put him on the pump,

203
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:19,041
then I want
to get out of here,

204
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,667
see how Maya's labor's
progressing.
Come on. Just walk.

205
00:10:21,709 --> 00:10:23,667
Okay. Thank you.
Drink this.

206
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:26,041
I'm good. You know there's
too much sugar in that stuff.

207
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:29,041
It's late at night,
you've been operating, just--
what is this?
You sound like my aunt.

208
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:32,709
Just drink
the crappy drink, Sam.
Okay, I'm gonna drink it.
Why are you being so weird?

209
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,083
Maya and Dell
were in a car accident

210
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,083
on their way
to the hospital.

211
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,083
Maya broke her l-2,
possibly l-3.

212
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:42,125
They're in the I.C.U.

213
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,458
Hypothermia?
 You lower the body temperature, you decrease metabolic demands

214
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,500
and you limit damage
to the spinal cord.

215
00:10:55,542 --> 00:10:58,041
Gives Dr. Shepherd
a lot more time to work

216
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:01,917
and maybe she's got a shot
at avoiding paralysis.
Yeah, but there's a baby
inside of her. Hypothermia?

217
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:04,417
It would kill the baby.
It may kill the baby.

218
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:07,583
It'll save the spinal cord.
It may
save the spinal cord.

219
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,834
So--so if--
if we save her child,

220
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:12,417
then we ensure that--
that she's paralyzed for life,

221
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:15,417
but if we kill the baby,
then--then she will walk again?

222
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:18,208
Is that what we're saying?

223
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,041
Is that
what we're saying?

224
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:23,041
Look, I'm not usually the glass-
half-full guy in the room,

225
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,417
but she's not gonna die.

226
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,583
I understand that's progress
from the initial diagnosis.

227
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:29,625
- But she may never walk again.
- A chair is not a death sentence.

228
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:33,041
I mean, people told me that
every day, and as much as it

229
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:36,375
made me want to smack 'em
in the face, they were right.
Save her legs.
I-I want her to walk again.

230
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:38,750
Wait. Wait.
What about the baby?

231
00:11:38,792 --> 00:11:41,208
That's a full-term child
that she's carrying.
I'm aware of that.

232
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,542
She wanted that child.
That child is hers.
I-I am aware of that, Sam.

233
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,208
You have wanted this child gone
since the moment

234
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,333
it's been conceived--
don't you--don't you dare.

235
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,041
This is your daughter
in this bed!
The moment it's been conceived!
What's the deal, Naomi?

236
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:54,041
Okay, stop it. Stop it.
Both of you.

237
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:56,125
Just take a breath.
Everyone, just...

238
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:08,041
Dink.

239
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:11,166
You're her husband...

240
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:14,041
The father of her child.

241
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:18,041
I don't, um...

242
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:20,834
I don't know how to...

243
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:24,166
I mean,
can't you save them both?

244
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,166
Why didn't I think of that?

245
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,458
Amelia.

246
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,709
I'm a kid. They don't teach you
how to choose between

247
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,709
your paralyzed wife
and your dying baby

248
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,125
in--in mathletes.

249
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:38,041
- I mean...
- It's okay.

250
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:43,291
You heard the man.

251
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:46,083
You're gonna
have to save 'em both.
How fast are you?

252
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,083
I'm fast, but...

253
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,709
This is a long shot.

254
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,083
If the baby's temp's
not down for too long...

255
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,959
It's not ideal, but...

256
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,333
You'd have to be
pretty damn fast.

257
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,750
Sam. I'm sorry.
I need you.

258
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:02,125
Patient's ready for bypass.

259
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:03,667
Okay.

260
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:06,875
Okay.

261
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,083
Sam.

262
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,291
Yeah.

263
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,792
Hey, I, uh...

264
00:13:15,834 --> 00:13:18,166
I-I just wanted to see
if you were okay.

265
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,166
I mean, obviously,
you're not okay,

266
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,792
but I...

267
00:13:22,834 --> 00:13:25,583
I don't know what i--
what I wanted. I...
Yeah.

268
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,583
I oughta head back inside.

269
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:30,000
Wait.

270
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,583
Could you just, uh,
stand here with me

271
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,542
for a minute?

272
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,709
Okay.

273
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,291
All right. I gotta...

274
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,458
Yeah.

275
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:10,542
Sam, they're waiting till
Maya's contractions stop

276
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:14,083
before they start
the hypothermia.

277
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,875
Part of me can't believe
I'm stuck in here.

278
00:14:18,917 --> 00:14:21,625
Part of me is relieved that I
got something to do with myself.

279
00:14:21,667 --> 00:14:23,125
Yeah.

280
00:14:26,792 --> 00:14:29,041
Hey, Sam, i--

281
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,875
is his hand moving?

282
00:14:30,917 --> 00:14:33,125
What?
His h--his hand is moving.

283
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,250
What are you talking--
whoa. Whoa. He's waking up.
Holy--

284
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,875
- get the hand away from the wound.
- Get me a lap.

285
00:14:37,917 --> 00:14:40,125
Get it away from the wound.
Push another .3
of etomidate.

286
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:43,041
That's what I'm doing.
Up the sux infusion.

287
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,583
There.
What the hell is going on here?
What was that?

288
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:49,792
Were you falling asleep?
Back off. The guy's a drunk.
His blood alcohol was .3.

289
00:14:49,834 --> 00:14:52,083
He's going through
the anesthesia

290
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,375
like it's iced tea.
So then...
Are you saying that...

291
00:14:54,417 --> 00:14:56,417
He's plastered
out of his mind.

292
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:59,333
How do you think
he crashed his car?

293
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,792
Is this the guy
that hit Maya?
Sam...

294
00:15:03,834 --> 00:15:07,625
Of course it is.

295
00:15:07,667 --> 00:15:10,291
I should've
figured it out myself.
Dr. Bennett, he's dropping
his cardiac output.

296
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,875
You've gotta
get back in there.

297
00:15:12,917 --> 00:15:15,917
Sam!

298
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:19,041
He almost killed
my daughter and her baby.

299
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,458
Pete,
she may never walk again.

300
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,959
He's gonna crash, Bennett.
 Sam, it's not the same guy.

301
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,041
The guy that hit Maya
didn't make it.

302
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,125
Charlotte was talking about it
in the waiting room.

303
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:32,542
It's L.A., right?
Car accident every four minutes.

304
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:35,917
Pete,
look at me in my face.

305
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,458
Are you lying?

306
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,709
No. I swear it.
It's not the same guy.

307
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:48,125
Bennett.
Shake it off.

308
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:58,125
Uh... Satinsky.

309
00:16:04,417 --> 00:16:07,583
You're damn right,
god's pissed off at you.

310
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,125
She called Dell.

311
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,375
Dell.

312
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:24,375
If I hadn't turned my back
on her when she was pregnant,

313
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:27,000
then she would've called me
when she went into labor.

314
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,208
She would've called me
to drive her to the hospital,

315
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,500
and we wouldn't be standing here
discussing whether

316
00:16:31,542 --> 00:16:35,000
she might die of hypothermia
or merely never walk again.

317
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:46,709
I know you didn't
crash the car, Dell.

318
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,709
All right? I know
you didn't crash the car.

319
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,834
I'm gonna go get some water.
Do you--do you want anything?

320
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,667
No. I'm fine. Thanks.

321
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:07,959
Stop beating yourself up...

322
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,583
Just for five minutes.
Can you do that?

323
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:14,792
Oh, god. William.

324
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:17,625
Well, he's fine.
Don't worry about him.
Uh, did you start
the treatment?

325
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:20,250
Yep, all good.
Yeah, and are you checking in?
How's he tolerating it?

326
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:23,375
Uh, no nausea, nothing.
He's off to a good start.

327

503
00:25:24,917 --> 00:25:28,375
It's Lucas
and my nostrils.
Yeah, well, it's in focus.

504
00:25:28,417 --> 00:25:30,458
I kinda like this one.

505
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,750
It looks like
he's gonna eat your face.
Or swab me.

506
00:25:33,792 --> 00:25:36,834
That kid can drool.
I'm telling you. Look at that.

507
00:25:36,875 --> 00:25:39,333
What's happening?

508
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:41,041
So far, so good.

509
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:43,417
Maya's temp is down.
Her pressure's holding.

510
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,417
Baby looks good
on the monitor.

511
00:25:45,458 --> 00:25:47,792
Amelia's about to get started,
so, uh...

512
00:25:47,834 --> 00:25:50,333
I'll keep you posted.

513
00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:52,709
Thank you.

514
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:10,709
Well, if we're looking

515
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,917
for a cheerier topic
of conversation...

516
00:26:12,959 --> 00:26:15,041
Yes. Yes, we are.

517
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:16,500
I'm, um...

518
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:18,500
Getting married.

519
00:26:18,542 --> 00:26:19,834
What?

520
00:26:19,875 --> 00:26:21,417
To whom?

521
00:26:21,458 --> 00:26:23,083
To Charlotte.
What?

522
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:25,041
Are you serious?
Yeah, got a ring,
popped the question.

523
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,208
You got a ring?
Yeah, you said,
"go get your girl."

524
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,208
I went ring shopping.
You said
"go get your girl"?

525
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,542
Well, I-I meant take her out
to dinner, not marry her.

526
00:26:31,583 --> 00:26:33,959
I was taking her to dinner.
Well, i-i--
I'm sorry, Sheldon.

527
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,125
But they are sort of
made for each other

528
00:26:36,166 --> 00:26:39,125
in a twisted kind of way,
but--but for dating--
you are not marrying her.

529
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:41,333
I kind of am.
Cooper--

530
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:44,250
I think "congratulations" is
what we're trying to say, right?

531
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:46,250
- Congratulations?
- It's fantastic, Cooper.

532
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:48,041
- Congratulations.
- Wow. Wow.

533
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:50,041
Just say it. Say the word.
Congratulations.

534
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:52,750
Dell. Sheldon. Even you, man.
Come on. Sorry.

535
00:26:52,792 --> 00:26:54,333
Just...

536
00:26:57,166 --> 00:26:59,083
Pete.

537
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:01,417
Okay. Maybe that was
a little too much to ask.

538
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:03,375
Dell, come on.
Give the man a hug.

539
00:27:03,417 --> 00:27:05,375
He's getting hitched
to a... difficult woman.

540
00:27:05,417 --> 00:27:06,792
Hey.

541
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:09,458
Dell.

542
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,959
Dell?

543
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,542
- Dell, wake up, sweetie.
- Wake up.

544
00:27:13,583 --> 00:27:16,041
Dell. Dell.
Dell?
Guys, he's unresponsive.

545
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,041
We have a patient down
in the O.R. waiting room.

546
00:27:20,083 --> 00:27:21,458
Send a crash cart.

547
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,041
We are not catching
a break today.

548
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:26,583
Hey, give me some mannitol.
He's bradying down.
He's got a bleed in his head.

549
00:27:26,625 --> 00:27:28,166
Think he's herniating?
Yep. Get me a twist drill.

550
00:27:28,208 --> 00:27:30,166
Burr holes?
I need to relieve
the pressure.

551
00:27:30,208 --> 00:27:32,000
Um, is he good?
Who are you?

552
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:34,542
I'm Marcel, his life partner.
Is he good?

553
00:27:34,583 --> 00:27:38,417
He's done this
plenty of times.
Maybe we call over to the O.R.,
s-see if Amelia can step out?

554
00:27:38,458 --> 00:27:41,709
No, no, no, no,
no, no. No stepping out. No.
His brain is exploding.

555
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:44,709
Yeah, and Maya's spine
is flapping in the breeze.
Could we get the backseat
drivers out of the room?

556
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:48,083
Y'all, shut up or get out.

557
00:27:50,417 --> 00:27:52,041
Nobody took a picture?
No.

558
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:55,375
Come on. There was a guy
drilling a hole in my head

559
00:27:55,417 --> 00:27:58,500
with six of you watching.
Nobody pulled out a cell phone?
You gonna make me sedate you?

560
00:27:58,542 --> 00:28:01,041
Get some sleep.
Hey.

561
00:28:01,083 --> 00:28:03,417
Cooper proposed to Charlotte.

562
00:28:03,458 --> 00:28:05,542
That's crazy.

563
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:07,583
- I know.
- O-oh.

564
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:10,083
Ow.
What "ow"?

565
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:12,041
Nothing,
just a killer headache.

566
00:28:12,083 --> 00:28:14,333
Well, they drilled
a hole in your head.

567
00:28:14,375 --> 00:28:17,041
Hands up...
Okay.

568
00:28:17,083 --> 00:28:20,000
Like this. Don't move.
Okay.

569
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:27,000
Oh, damn it.
What?

570
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:31,375
It's Dr. King. I need
a ventriculostomy setup

571
00:28:31,417 --> 00:28:33,375
and a head C.T.

572
00:28:33,417 --> 00:28:35,417
No, right now.

573
00:28:35,458 --> 00:28:37,333
Charlotte?

574
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:40,041
Yeah, there's a bleed
on the contralateral side.

575
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:42,041
The epidural pressure
was holding it back.

576
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:44,291
Now it's all over the place.
What does that mean?

577
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:47,041
It means you gotta crack
your patient open.

578
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:49,041
How much longer
you got in here?

579
00:28:49,083 --> 00:28:52,041
I don't know.
Maybe an hour.
Think you can do it after?

580
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:54,458
She's had a long night,
Charlotte. Page steiner.

581
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:58,000
Steiner's out of town. James
is covering. James missed it.
Well,
it's an honest mistake.

582
00:28:58,041 --> 00:29:00,709
I mean,
with a bleed like that--
it's Dell.

583
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:03,000
The patient's Dell.

584
00:29:04,834 --> 00:29:07,041
I'll be out
as soon as I can.

585
00:29:09,709 --> 00:29:12,208
This is a crap day.

586
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:16,250
It's another bleed.

587
00:29:16,291 --> 00:29:18,667
And it's expanding.
But we can get it.

588
00:29:18,709 --> 00:29:21,041
Just means we need to do
some more damage to your skull.

589
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:22,834
And Amelia's
almost done with Maya,

590
00:29:22,875 --> 00:29:24,500
so she can do the procedure.

591
00:29:24,542 --> 00:29:27,291
Says she'll get a kick
out of seeing your brain.

592
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:29,834
Meanwhile, I'm gonna get
the most attractive

593
00:29:29,875 --> 00:29:31,834
of our nurses
to come and shave your head.

594
00:29:31,875 --> 00:29:33,834
And you can work that buzz cut

595
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:37,417
for a few weeks
until that mop grows back.

596
00:29:37,458 --> 00:29:40,041
Um...

597
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:43,083
Betsey's at home
with a sitter named Andrea.

598
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:45,083
I want you
to bring her here.

599
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:47,834
Come on, Dell--
Violet.

600
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:50,083
- It's the middle of the night.
- Violet...

601
00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:52,041
Get Betsey.

602
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:54,458
I'll go.

603
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,959
So I got into
medical school.

604
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,125
You did?

605
00:30:09,166 --> 00:30:11,041
Yeah.

606
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:13,959
U.c.l.a. I got in.

607
00:30:16,417 --> 00:30:19,125
How are we doing, ladies?

608
00:30:19,166 --> 00:30:22,041
Cord's decompressed. I'm having
trouble placing the last graft.

609
00:30:22,083 --> 00:30:24,583
- What can we do to expedite matters?
- Is it the baby?

610
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:26,333
Yeah, bradycardic.
How bad?

611
00:30:26,375 --> 00:30:29,542
Pretty bad.
You gotta get out.

612
00:30:29,583 --> 00:30:32,375
Wow. You are just full of
good ideas, aren't you?
If the heart rate stays
that low much longer,

613
00:30:32,417 --> 00:30:34,583
we're gonna have a dead baby.
You move that baby
before I finish,

614
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:37,166
you slice her spine in half.
Amelia--

615
00:30:37,208 --> 00:30:39,333
is this supposed to be helping?
'Cause it's not.

616
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:44,417
I know Guinea pigs like carrots
and--and cucumbers.

617
00:30:44,458 --> 00:30:46,542
They're definitely crazy
about those.

618
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:48,542
You can give 'em those,
okay?

619
00:30:48,583 --> 00:30:51,041
But the pretzels just aren't
so good for 'em.

620
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:53,041
But that's nice
that you wanted to share.

621
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:55,041
It shows you were
thinking about him.

622
00:30:55,083 --> 00:30:58,417

pretty good.
