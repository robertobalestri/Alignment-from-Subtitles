♪ Ohhh ohhh ohhh ♪

2
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:37,041
Can I go to school now?

3
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:12,041
I'm very good
at accepting apologies, Mark.

4
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:16,041
I apologized
over the phone.
"Fine. I'll bring her
to L.A." is not an apology.

5
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:19,041
Wh-what is that?
That's just a shadow.
That's the baby.

6
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:21,458
Where's the a.T.M.?
A.V.M., sweetheart.

7
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,083
A.t.m. Is where
you get money.
You're not gonna see
the a.V.M. Here.

8
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:28,083
That's just a cluster
of blood vessels.
That aren't supposed
to be there,

9
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:31,750
and if you pop them,
I'm gonna die?
W--no.
Um, Sloan, it's just

10
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:34,333
a tangled cluster of
blood vessels under the baby.

11
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:36,291
I'm not gonna go
anywhere near them,

12
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:38,667
so I won't be popping them.

13
00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:41,041
I'm gonna go in,
uh, laparoscopically

14
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:44,917
and very carefully cut
one of the amniotic bands

15
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:48,041
from around the baby's legs.
And then he'll be okay?
He'll be able to walk?

16
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:50,208
Then he'll be perfect.
Well, that's what
you said last time.

17
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,709
That was my fault, Sloan.

18
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:56,041
I shoulda let her finish
the surgery the first time.
Now that is an apology.

19
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,500
What is that? What is
that thing right there?

20
00:01:58,542 --> 00:02:01,583
Is that something growing
out of his head?
That is a penis.

21
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:04,041
Sloan, you're gonna make
yourself crazy

22
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:06,041
trying to read the ultrasound.

23
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:08,500
Has her blood pressure
always been this high?

24
00:02:08,542 --> 00:02:11,000
Yeah, it's been going up.
She's scared.

25
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,333
So am I.

26
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:25,250
Mark Sloan, Pete Wilder.
Pete Wilder, Mark Sloan.

27
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,166
Hi, good to meet you.
Mm-hmm.

28
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:29,875
And this is Sloan,
Mark's daughter.
Sloan Sloan?

29
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:31,875
Sloan Riley.
She got her mom's
last name.

30
00:02:31,917 --> 00:02:34,583
Oh, okay. Well, Sloan,
Dr. Montgomery asked me

31
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:37,083
to help you try
to calm down a little.

32
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:39,583
She says you're nervous
about your surgery.
What is he, a pharmacist?

33
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:42,041
No, alternative medicine.
Dude, you are not putting
those needles in me.

34
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:45,291
Most people barely feel it.
Dude, you heard her. You're not
putting those needles in her.

35
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:48,000
Dude...
Pete is doing me a favor.

36
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:51,000
With respect, I didn't bring
my daughter down here

37
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,542
for witch doctoring.

38
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,041
With respect, really?
Mark.

39
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:56,166
What kind of medicine
do you practice?
Plastics.

40
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,750
What are you laughing at?

41
00:02:58,792 --> 00:03:01,709
Ah, nothing. Saving the world
one boob job at a time.

42
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,041
Hey, listen, pal--
okay, okay. Look, enough. Pete,
you're gonna do your thing.

43
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:07,166
Mark, you're gonna let Pete
do his thing.
No, I'm not gonna let Pete--

44
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,041
oh, yes, you are.
I'm in charge here.

45
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:12,583
And if you want me to do this
surgery again, then you're gonna

46
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:15,417
follow me out of this room
right now. Right now, Mark.

47
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,250
Right now. Let's go.

48
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:30,000
Hi, Dr. Cooper.
Hey, Cody.

49
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:32,417
Is your mom home?
Oh, she ran
to the post office.

50
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:35,041
She'll be home soon.
Could we wait inside?

51
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,625
My mom's a super good mom.

52
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:40,041
I know.
She's super nice.

53
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:43,458
I know. I've met her. You trying
to fix us up or something?

54
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,917
No. I just...

55
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,709
Okay, come in.

56
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:59,083
All right. Follow me.

57
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:02,125
Just be careful you don't
knock over any piles.

58
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,208
So, uh, your mom likes
to hold on to stuff, huh?
She's a super good mom.

59
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,291
I know. You said that.
I was thinking maybe

60
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:24,041
one of the reasons you wanted me
to come here was so I could see

61
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,041
- how much stuff she keeps.
- Cody.

62
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,667
Oh.

63
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:30,875
Oh, my god. Dr. Freedman,
what are y--what are you doing?

64
00:04:30,917 --> 00:04:32,709
The itching
was killing me, mom.

65
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,333
I was gonna go crazy.
Cody, I would've taken you
to the doctor.

66
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,542
I know, but...
Dr. Freedman,

67
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:41,041
I-I know what you
must be thinking.
No, I'm thinking that, uh,

68
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:44,041
we're gonna have to take Cody
to the hospital.
What? Why?

69
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,959
Well, he's got a-a skin
infection, a pretty bad one.
Oh, god.

70
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,041
Cody, you can't scratch that,
okay?

71
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,917
Do you want to take him in
your car, you can meet me there?
Yeah. Yes, thank you.

72
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,291
Mm-hmm.
Thanks so much.

73
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,583
See you there.

74
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,458
She's crazy cakes!
That's your diagnosis?

75
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,542
Crazy cakes. There is
broken crap piled everywhere.

76
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,542
And I'm not just
talking unsanitary.

77
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:05,041
I am talking insane.
Okay. Well, it sounds like
she's a hoarder.

78
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,500
That--that's an obsessive-
compulsive disorder, Coop.

79
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:09,041
Maybe it's genetic.

80
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,709
Maybe it was triggered
by a trauma or loss.

81
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,542
Or we could go
with crazy cakes.
If you had seen this place,
you would.

82
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,125
Okay. Well, I will
talk to her.

83
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,750
It's actually
a very hard disorder to treat.

84
00:05:18,792 --> 00:05:22,166
But, uh, I'll do the best
I can. How's the kid?
The kid is smart.
The kid is articulate.

85
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:24,166
I honestly thought maybe
he had called me there

86
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,750
as a cry for help so I could
see this, but he's got

87
00:05:26,792 --> 00:05:29,083
what I'm pretty sure is
a staph infection on his arm,

88
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:31,542
so maybe he just needed
that cast off.

89
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,542
I've got him at St. ambrose
for the arm,

90
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,291
and he is staying there
until that house is clean.
Well, that might take
some time.

91
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,125
Okay, but if it takes
too much time,

92
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:41,583
I'm calling
child protective services.
Thanks for the vote
of confidence.

93
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:44,917
Hey, Coop. How's it going
with Charlotte?
I can't forgive her.

94
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:47,041
I'm trying, but I just...

95
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,959
I can't seem to forgive her.

96
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,834
What is the matter with you?
Me? What's the matter
with you?

97
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,834
You're as wound up
as I've ever seen you.

98
00:05:57,875 --> 00:06:00,041
I am not the one

99
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,959
starting schoolyard fights
with other doctors.
You're wound up, Addie.
Just admit it.

100
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,041
Bizzy's a lesbian.
What?

101
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,250
My mother--she's a lesbian,

102
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,250
which means the captain
wasn't a cheater.

103
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,250
It was all a sham--
my whole childhood.

104
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:13,834
Everything I believed about
my dad, my mom, love, marriage--

105
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,834
it's all turned on its head.

106
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:19,208
So, yeah, I'm a little...
Wound up.
Wow.

107
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,417
Your turn.

108
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,041
Lexie dumped me.

109
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,417
Oh.

110
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:27,041
I asked her to raise
Sloan's baby with me.

111
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,583
Or, you know, raise it
with me and Sloan.

112
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:32,375
She's a little young for that,
don't you think?
Do not take her side.

113
00:06:32,417 --> 00:06:34,792
I'm sorry.
It sucks.

114
00:06:34,834 --> 00:06:36,083
Yeah.

115
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:39,041
Your thing sucks, too.

116
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,500
Bizzy's a lesbian?

117
00:06:40,542 --> 00:06:43,041
Thank you.

118
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:49,667
When did we get so--

119
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:51,375
old?

120
00:06:51,417 --> 00:06:53,291
I was gonna say sad.

121
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,792
When did we get so sad?

122
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,917
Don't you wish
we did heroin?

123
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,959
Addison Forbes Montgomery--
no, no, I mean,
don't you wish we did drugs,

124
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,041
drank too much,
shot something into our vein?

125
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:08,041
I mean, nothing, you know, that
would make you ruin your life

126
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,625
or kill you or make you
have to go to meetings

127
00:07:10,667 --> 00:07:13,041
and say, "hi, I'm Addison.
And I'm an alcoholic."

128
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,417
But just...

129
00:07:15,917 --> 00:07:17,875
You know, Nai--she eats.

130
00:07:17,917 --> 00:07:20,041
She puts food on top of it,

131
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,500
and that numbs the pain,

132
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:25,041
the malaise,
the--the--the sad.

133
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:28,041
I mean, she puts food on top
of it, and she feels good.

134
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,083
But I... I don't...

135
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,125
I have green juice.

136
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:34,125
I mean,
that's all I really like.

137
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:37,250
And green juice, I can't really
put that on top if it.

138
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,083
I want to put something
on top of it,

139
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,583
but I don't have anything.

140
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:44,583
Mark, what are you doing?
I'm telling you how I feel.

141
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:47,875
And I hear you.
Numb the pain.
What--

142
00:07:47,917 --> 00:07:51,709
numb the sad. Feel good.
Put something on top of it.

143
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,041
Mark, I said put something
on top of it,

144
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,667
not put you on top of me.

145
00:07:56,709 --> 00:08:00,959
My life is in ruins.
It's a mess.

146
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,041
I'm about to be
a grandfather,

147
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,709
and I'm alone.

148
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,542
I don't know of a lot
of surefire ways

149
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,750
to numb the pain,

150
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:13,417
but I do know one.

151
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:15,417
Now... do you want
to feel better

152
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,542

00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,625
I...

166
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:52,875
I can't
catch my breath.

167
00:08:52,917 --> 00:08:55,250
Well, we could call in
the dude with the needles...

168
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,250
To help calm you down.

169
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,208
Oh. I forgot
how much fun you were.

170
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,750
Yeah, well,
that's what happens...

171
00:09:08,792 --> 00:09:10,750
When you date children.

172
00:09:10,792 --> 00:09:13,041
You forget what it's like...
To be with a woman.
Hey.

173
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:15,041
Oh!

174
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,041
No being mean about Lexie.

175
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,583
Did you just spank me?

176
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,291
Oh, what, what, you want
to start something?
Maybe.

177
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,709
Come on. Bring it, sister.
I will, right now, Dr. Sloan.

178
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,500
Oh, I'll give you
more of the same.

179
00:09:25,542 --> 00:09:27,583
Really? Oh! My god.

180
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,709
Addi--aah.
Oh!

181
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,041
Sam, close the door!
Addison, this is
a place of business.

182
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:35,709
Uh, Sam, will you, uh, just
toss me that shirt there, buddy?

183
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,041
Sam, close the door.

184
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:43,041
Hey.
Oh, my god.

185
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,500
Sloan Sloan went right to sleep.
The needles worked wonders.

186
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:47,041
Thanks. Great job, dude.

187
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,959
Okay, then.

188
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,041
Too bad I joined
the other practice.

189
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,625
This place has perks.

190
00:09:53,667 --> 00:09:56,000
Sam, close the door!

191
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,875
I keep everything of Cody's

192
00:09:59,917 --> 00:10:01,875
because he might want it
someday.

193
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:03,625
Report cards, trophies.

194
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:05,625
Mm-hmm. Yeah, and there's
other stuff that,

195
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:08,041
you know, needs to be donated
to goodwill or somewhere.

196
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,041
Have you called anybody
about coming to pick it up?

197
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:13,458
You know what? I haven't
gone through all of it just yet.
Do you need help
doing that?

198
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,041
I know how overwhelming it could
be to be a single parent.

199
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,333
Well, it was easier
when his dad was alive,

200
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:22,000
but Cody and I are, uh,
we're okay now. We do fine.

201
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:25,041
When did he die?

202
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,917
Three years ago.

203
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm sorry. What happened?

204
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,333
I know that you want to help,

205
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:34,083
but honestly, I don't need...
Any help.

206
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:38,250
Cody and I are just fine.

207
00:10:43,834 --> 00:10:46,542
You get 30 seconds.
I'm sorry?

208
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:49,041
We are business partners,
so you get 30 seconds

209
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,083
to lecture me
on my business practices.

210
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,500
But if you start to lecture me
on something not related

211
00:10:53,542 --> 00:10:57,000
to my business practices, I will
walk away. Those are the rules.

212
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,834
Oh, so our friendship
has rules now?
No. We're not talking
as friends right now.

213
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:02,041
We're talking
as business partners.
Well, I want to talk
to my friend.

214
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:05,208
She doesn't want to talk
to you right now.
So now you're talking about
yourself in third person.

215
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,959
Hi. Did you sleep
with Mark Sloan

216
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
on the floor of your office?
Yep.

217
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,834
Sam--
and she's making up rules

218
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:14,208
and she's talking about herself
in third person.
Yes, I am, because I have

219
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,208
earned that right.
When you have gone through

220
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,625
what I've gone through with
my family, you have the right

221
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:22,375
to be a little eccentric
for a few weeks.

222
00:11:22,417 --> 00:11:24,166
You have the right
to refer to yourself

223
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:27,208
in the third person and have sex
on the floor of your office

224
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,375
and apply random rules to old
friendships. You have the right.

225
00:11:30,417 --> 00:11:32,875
Okay. All right, Sam.
You need to leave Addison alone

226
00:11:32,917 --> 00:11:34,792
because you're
making her scream.

227
00:11:34,834 --> 00:11:37,417
Addison, I am here for you
if you need me.

228
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:40,625
You see that?
That is a friend.
Okay.

229
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:43,834
Okay, you came to me and you
were upset, you were scared,

230
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,250
you were a little desperate,
and I turned you down.

231
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,792
Now I turned you down
because I am a good person.

232
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:51,667
Mark Sloan had you naked within
an hour of his arrival.

233
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:54,041
Now what does that
say to you?

234
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:58,041
Addison.
You broke the rules.
I'm walking away.

235
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,792
Relative Harmony?

236
00:12:07,834 --> 00:12:11,625
Well, as long as Betsey's
not with me, she seems fine.

237
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:13,041
She'll come around.

238
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,625
She hates me.

239
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:17,917
Maya hates me
for no discernible reason.

240
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:19,917
Try not to
take it personally.

241
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:21,917
Doughnuts help.

242
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:23,917
I'm not the one
who blew up the house.

243
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:25,917
I'm not the one
with the drug habit.

244
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:27,917
And I lost someone, too.

245
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:30,083
I went through
a trauma, too.

246
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,709
Dell, she's 7.

247
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,500
I know, I know.

248
00:12:33,542 --> 00:12:35,333
She's 7.

249
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,750
I know.

250
00:12:37,792 --> 00:12:39,750
Hoarding is a mental illness,
Cooper.

251
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:42,750
I can't just tell her
to snap out of it.
No, but you can get
a dump truck,

252
00:12:42,792 --> 00:12:46,417
back it up
and start shoveling.
Then she's just gonna start with
the behavior all over again.

253
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:50,041
I need some time to get
to the root of the problem.
He doesn't have time.
He's got staph eating his arm.

254
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,875
Which could happen in
a clean house. You know that.

255
00:12:52,917 --> 00:12:55,125
And you're treating it
at St. ambrose.
Yeah, and Charlotte's
gonna slice me

256
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:57,250
for using one of her
precious beds for someone

257
00:12:57,291 --> 00:13:00,041
that's not
on death's door, so--
for god sake, Cooper. A patient
needs a bed, admit him,

258
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,458
but don't keep blaming me for
everything. It's getting old.

259
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,875

throwing stuff

00:16:11,917 --> 00:16:13,375
These erasers--

331
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:16,875
they are all still good.

332
00:16:16,917 --> 00:16:18,667
This can be repaired.

333
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:22,542
How would your life be different
if you threw this out?

334
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:25,000
I need it.
Why?

335
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,583
Because you never know...

336
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,041
When you're gonna
need something.

337
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:31,083
And then if you throw it out,
you don't have it anymore.

338
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:34,500
I'm not crazy.
Maybe I'm a little eccentric.

339
00:16:34,542 --> 00:16:36,583
I know what people think.

340
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:39,000
But I'm not crazy.

341
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,625
Surgical time-out's complete.
Let's prep the belly.

342
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,000
Sam.

343
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,583
Is everything okay?
Everything is perfect,

344
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:56,083
'cause you can't
walk away from me in here.

345
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,041
Look who's making up
the rules now.

346
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,709
I am at work, Sam.

347
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,750
You're really
going to talk about

348
00:17:01,792 --> 00:17:04,125
my very, very personal life
while I'm at work?

349
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,458
No. No, no, no.
Hello, everyone.

350
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,959
I am going to talk to you
about dogs.

351
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:18,250
Where's my mom?
Why isn't she here?

352
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:20,250
She's on her way.
How you feelin'?

353
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:22,542
I want to go home.

354
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,333
Yeah, I bet.

355
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:27,250
Hey, um,
I have a question for you.

356
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:30,125
Do you have any family
around here,

357
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,750
any aunts, uncles?

358
00:17:31,792 --> 00:17:33,417
No, why?

359
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:36,583
Well, I'm working with your mom
on cleaning your house up,

360
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:39,000
and it'd be better

361
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:42,792
if you had someplace else
to stay for a while.
No, I need to be with her.
I take care of her.

362
00:17:42,834 --> 00:17:45,583
Well, would you like that
to be different?

363
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,875
You don't understand.

364
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:50,375
Sh-she needs help, Cody.

365
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:53,041
She needs more help
than you can give her.

366
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,875
And this separation
would only be temporary.

367
00:17:55,917 --> 00:17:59,250
You can't do that.
She'd be...

368
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:03,375
It'd be like when my dad
and my sister died.

369
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:06,000
Do you mind
if I ask you about that?

370
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,125
My dad had us weekends.

371
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,458
So they were divorced?

372
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,041
I was sick, so it was
just my sister that Friday.

373
00:18:20,792 --> 00:18:25,333
They ran off the road
in latigo canyon.

374
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:29,125
I have to stay with my mom.

375
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,959
And then you have
golden retrievers.

376
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,959
Now golden retrievers,
like labs,

377
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,041
whether they be blond
or chocolate,

378
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:39,041
they're people dogs. They're
all about pleasing you,

379
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,041
all about making you happy.

380
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,125
You can neglect them,
you can ignore them,

381
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:45,875
you can walk all over them,

382
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:49,041
but still, making you happy
is their first thought.
Snipping the first band.

383
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,041
Now I would be fine
if you took up with

384
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:53,667
a golden retriever or a lab--
heck, even a schnauzer.

385
00:18:53,709 --> 00:18:56,458
But Sloan?
Sloan is a dachshund.

386
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,917
Dachshunds like to eat poop

387
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:01,875
right up off the street--
other dogs' poop.

388
00:19:01,917 --> 00:19:03,875
They're more concerned
with their own needs

389
00:19:03,917 --> 00:19:06,458
than they are
with making you happy.

390
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,500
They're filthy and immoral--
immoral?
They're immoral dogs?

391
00:19:09,542 --> 00:19:11,875
The owners of dachshunds
are desperate--

392
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,500
desperate for affection.

393
00:19:13,542 --> 00:19:16,041
But it's the wrong kind
of affection,

394
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,917
the kind that makes you
always take care of them.
Oh, my god.

395
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:21,041
What happened?
The a.V.M. Just blew.

396
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,333
She's bleeding all over.
I can't see a thing.

397
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:26,041
Convert to open.
With the baby
still inside her?

398
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,834
Yes. 10-blade.

399
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,500
Was this my fault? I was
talking. W-We were talking.

400
00:19:40,542 --> 00:19:42,917
I'm capable of talking
and operating simultaneously.

401
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:45,041
You blew the a.V.M.?!

402
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,834
- Not on purpose.
- I already told him that.

403
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,875
Well, then
what the hell happened?!
Stop yelling at her.

404
00:19:49,917 --> 00:19:53,333
Don't yell.
 She lost a lot of blood, but she's gonna be okay.

405
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,875
And the baby?
I think he's gonna be fine.

406
00:19:55,917 --> 00:19:58,667
You think?
I hope. I'm sorry. The a.V.M.
Is very delicate, Mark.

407
00:19:58,709 --> 00:20:00,542
It's directly below
the dissection,

408
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:03,959
and it--it--it--
it just blew.
I need to see her.

409
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,458
Okay, look, Mark, she's gonna be
in bad shape when she wakes up.

410
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,750
She hemorrhaged.
I had to open her up.

411
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:10,750
She's gonna be much worse
than last time.

412
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:13,166
The last thing she needs
is to look up

413
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,875
and see you hovering,
terrified.
What do you expect me to do?

414
00:20:15,917 --> 00:20:19,000
Why don't we just take a walk?
We can just calm--
Naomi, don't talk to me like
I'm a child. I'm not a 12 year--

415
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,041
Mark, please,
just go with Naomi.

416
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,709
She knows
what she's talking about.
Fix this.

417
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:31,083
That baby has to be okay.

418
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,875
He will. He will.

419
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:37,166
I care about Mark Sloan.

420
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,709
I loved him once.
And he was our best friend.

421
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,709
And, yes, he's done
a lot of stupid things,

422
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,709
but he also let all of us
do a lot of stupid things.

423
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,041
He let us do
a lot of stupid things

424
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,792
and he never judged us.

425
00:20:48,834 --> 00:20:51,166
He's not just a dog, Sam.

426
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:56,041
Sure, he's got a screwed up
moral compass, but so do I.

427
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:58,208
He's a good man.

428
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:02,375
This baby's gotta be okay.

429
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:08,041
I didn't even know
he had a sister.

430
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:11,041
Yeah, and the fact that she
didn't even mention it...
Yeah.

431
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:13,500
It has to be the root
of the problem.

432
00:21:13,542 --> 00:21:16,000
Hey, where's Cody?
His mother took him home.

433
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:19,875
I'm calling d.C.F.S.
D.C.F.S. Is not
the answer--

434
00:21:19,917 --> 00:21:22,208
she snatched Cody out of
the hospital

435
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,959
and brought him back
to the house of horrors!
Why are you shouting at me?

436
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,125
Because you have no concern
at all for this boy.
The best thing for that child

437
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:30,000
would be to have a healthy
mother, and frankly,

438
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:32,500
the best thing for you would be
to stop displacing your anger.
What is that
supposed to mean?

439
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:34,375
You're angry at Charlotte.
You're angry at yourself.

440
00:21:34,417 --> 00:21:36,333
You keep lashing out
at everybody else

441
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,333
so you don't have to take
responsibility.

442
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:40,750
I am trying to help Cody.
By putting him
in foster care?

443
00:21:40,792 --> 00:21:42,750
By ripping him
away from his mother?

444
00:21:42,792 --> 00:21:44,875
By breaking his heart?
Get a grip, Cooper.

445
00:21:44,917 --> 00:21:48,041
Deal with your problems.
Why do you think
Charlotte lied to me?

446
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:50,458
No, no, Cooper. You gotta
talk to her about that.

447
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,041
I'm serious. I am out.

448
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,667
Oh, you're out? You're out.

449
00:21:53,709 --> 00:21:55,667
You don't get to be out!

450
00:21:55,709 --> 00:21:58,667
How many times--how many times
have I had to listen to you

451
00:21:58,709 --> 00:22:01,250
go on and on and on
about Allan

452
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:03,583
or Sheldon
or, oh, my god, Pete?

453
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:05,917
Pete this and Pete that,
Violet.

454
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:07,917
And look how well
that worked out.

455
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:11,625
Look how healthy I am.
Yay me. I am super normal.

456
00:22:11,667 --> 00:22:13,834
Point taken.
Thank you.

457
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:16,834
Talk to her... not me.

458
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:18,208
Work it out or not.

459
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:21,375
You love each other,
you don't--figure it out...

460
00:22:21,417 --> 00:22:24,083
With Charlotte.

461
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:27,625
I'm calling d.C.F.S.

462
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:36,500
Is there some reason why we are
eating in silence yet again?

463
00:22:36,542 --> 00:22:38,542
May I be excused?

464
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:41,125
Maya, why don't you just
tell me what's going on?

465
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:44,041
We can talk about it.

466
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:47,542
Can I be excused, too?
Betsey, Naomi went to
a lot of trouble--

467
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:50,542
thank you for breakfast.
May I be excused?

468
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:52,667
Sure, honey.

469
00:22:52,709 --> 00:22:55,000
Yeah.

470
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:59,959
Well, at least you know why
yours isn't speaking to you.

471
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,041
I didn't kill her mother,
you know?

472
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:03,792
I'm just gonna say it
to her, you know,

473
00:23:03,834 --> 00:23:06,542
'cause at some point,
you gotta grow up.
Dell, she's--

474
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:08,792
I know she's 7. I-I know.

475
00:23:08,834 --> 00:23:11,000
But I-I can't
feel like this every day.

476
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:14,208
You know, I can't keep being
treated like the enemy.
Well, maybe all she needs
is an apology.

477
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,667
What am I apologizing for?
I did the right thing.

478
00:23:16,709 --> 00:23:18,083
Heather's faced
was burned off.

479
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:20,458
You know, she burned
her face off getting high.

480
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,458
You really think I should've
let Betsey into that room?
Okay, you're in mourning,

481
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,000
and, uh, you are my friend,
and you've been through hell,

482
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:28,000
so I've been
really gentle with you.

483
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:30,792
But I think I am not gonna be
gentle with you anymore.

484
00:23:30,834 --> 00:23:32,792
I think I'm just gonna
tell you the truth

485
00:23:32,834 --> 00:23:35,166
because that's what I would
want you to do for me.

486
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:38,000
Are you okay with that,
if I'm not gentle anymore?

487
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,041
Yes.
Okay.

488
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:42,041
I think you should've
let her in that room.

489
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:44,875
I think you should've let her
say good-bye to her mother.

490
00:23:44,917 --> 00:23:47,875
I think Pete was right, and I
think you owe him an apology.

491
00:23:47,917 --> 00:23:50,834
And I think that Betsey
has a right to be pissed.

492
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:52,333
I would be pissed, too.

493
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:55,667
7 or 37, I would be pissed.

494
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:00,417
Mom?

495
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:02,959
Hey, Sloan. It's Addison.

496
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,083
Where am I?

497
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:08,041
You're in the hospital
in Los Angeles.

498
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:11,333
You just had surgery,
but everything is fine.

499
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:14,875
You and the baby are fine.
Where's my mom?
I want my mom.

500
00:24:14,917 --> 00:24:17,333
Well, Mark's here.
Your dad's here.

501
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:22,125
And he's gonna be here
in just a few minutes.
I don't want him.
I want my mommy.

502
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:26,375
I don't want any
of this. I don't want a baby.

503
00:24:26,417 --> 00:24:29,375
I just want to go home.
I want my life back.

504
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:32,250
I want to go home.

505
00:24:34,417 --> 00:24:36,792
I'm delirious.

506
00:24:36,834 --> 00:24:38,792
I am delirious
with exhaustion.
Mm.

507
00:24:38,834 --> 00:24:40,792
Lucas thought it was morning
at 2:00 A.M.

508
00:24:40,834 --> 00:24:43,041
And then again at 3:00 A.M.
and at 4:00,

509
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:45,041
and i'm--i feel like
I'm underwater.

510
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:47,041
See? That's what
I'm talking about.

511
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:49,083
You're a grown man,
and you're a wreck.

512
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:52,083
That's what you were
talking about to who?
To myself...

513
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:54,542
In my head.

514
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:57,083
Sloan Sloan--she's...

515
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:59,083
She's pretty simple,
you know, and young.

516
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:01,709
And her mom had her
when she was young.

517
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,959
And I don't think she's
even thought about adoption.

518
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,959
I don't think anybody's
counseled her.

519
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,959
And I think she feels trapped,

520
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,959
and I think it's
my responsibility as her doctor

521
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,083
to give her her options.
Well, of course it is.
What's the problem?

522
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:16,083
Mark. He really...
Wants this baby.

523
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:18,083
He wants
to raise it with her.

524
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:20,542
Are we talking about
the plastic surgeon?

525
00:25:20,583 --> 00:25:23,542
Oh, the contempt

526
00:25:23,583 --> 00:25:26,166
that seeps
from your every word--

527
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:29,792
do you have that for
every plastic surgeon or just,

528
00:25:29,834 --> 00:25:32,792
you know, ones that I sleep with
on the floor of my office?
I just--

529
00:25:32,834 --> 00:25:34,792
I don't think there's
anything to debate, Addison.

530
00:25:34,834 --> 00:25:36,792
You're her doctor,
she's a kid--
she's 18.

531
00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:38,792
Yeah, well, still,
it's your responsibility

532
00:25:38,834 --> 00:25:41,583
to counsel her,
give her the options.

533
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:44,000
Yeah.

534
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:47,000
Back in New York, you know,
Mark and I were together,

535
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:50,041
and, um...
I got pregnant.

536
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:53,166
And I told him about it,
and he was excited,

537
00:25:53,208 --> 00:25:56,792
and... I... wasn't,

538
00:25:56,834 --> 00:25:58,375
and I had an abortion.

539
00:25:58,417 --> 00:26:00,458
I didn't talk to him
about it first.

540
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:04,041
I made the decision
for both of us.

541
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:05,458
And he wanted it.

542
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,667
And he wants this one.

543
00:26:12,041 --> 00:26:15,041
One thing
can't inform the other.

544
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:18,500
Your loyalty to your friend
and your--your guilt

545
00:26:18,542 --> 00:26:21,250
or your remorse, it can't
inform your patient care.

546
00:26:21,291 --> 00:26:24,250
You gotta give her the options
and let her choose.

547
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,875
Maybe it'll go his way.

548
00:26:26,917 --> 00:26:28,917
And I'm sorry.

549
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:31,667
It sounds just awful.

550
00:26:31,709 --> 00:26:33,709
Thanks.

551
00:26:38,667 --> 00:26:41,333
Don't fall asleep on my head.
I'm up. I'm up.

552
00:26:43,917 --> 00:26:45,750
How's the baby?

553
00:26:45,792 --> 00:26:48,041
Heartbeat's holding strong.

554
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:50,458
I haven't
taken my eyes off it.

555
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,667
Good.

556
00:26:51,709 --> 00:26:53,834
That's, uh...

557
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:56,250
That's good.

558
00:26:58,667 --> 00:26:59,959
What?

559
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,041
This midlife crisis,
uh, you're having,

560
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:05,041
all this talk about
moving to L.A.--

561
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:07,917
whatever is--is going on
with you,

562
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,917
something worse is going on
with Addison.

563
00:27:09,959 --> 00:27:13,709
And I'm not about to let her
be your landing pad.

564
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:16,166
What the hell
do you care, Sam?

565
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:18,792
Well, she--she just spends
a lot of time, uh,

566
00:27:18,834 --> 00:27:21,083
trying to take care of
everyone at the practice,

567
00:27:21,125 --> 00:27:23,709
so, you know, I'm trying
to take care of her.

568
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,709
I'm saying, I like you, Mark,

569
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:28,500
but what you've been doing
around here,

570
00:27:28,542 --> 00:27:31,041
it's not you at your best.

571
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:34,041
And I ask again,
what the hell do you care?

572
00:27:34,083 --> 00:27:36,125
I just care.

573
00:27:42,583 --> 00:27:44,291
Hey.

574
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:45,917
Looking for me?

575
00:27:45,959 --> 00:27:48,959
Yeah. I wanted to let you know
I have a staff meeting tonight.

576
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,041
I'm not sure
when I'm gonna be home.

577
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:53,333
You lied.

578
00:27:53,375 --> 00:27:56,125
Why did you lie?
I just want to know why.

579
00:27:56,166 --> 00:28:00,208
I told you why.
No, y-you told me that there
are things you can't t--

580
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:04,166
I told you I didn't want
to go there.
Were you ever gonna marry me?
Was that a lie, too?

581
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:10,542
Oh, I cannot believe you have
the nerve to do this here.
What?

582
00:28:10,583 --> 00:28:14,000
Can you answer the question?
Can you not ask it?
I have answered it?!

583
00:28:21,625 --> 00:28:23,792
You, uh,
you seen Addison?

584
00:28:23,834 --> 00:28:26,375
No, not recently.
Not down here.

585
00:28:26,417 --> 00:28:28,000
Oh.

586
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:31,667
Your son?

587
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:32,792
Yeah.

588
00:28:32,834 --> 00:28:34,792
And you bring him
to work?

589
00:28:34,834 --> 00:28:38,041
Naomi is cool with that?

590
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:41,166
I'm sorry. I, uh,
I'm about to have a kid.

591
00:28:41,208 --> 00:28:44,166
Or my kid--my kid
is about to have a kid.

592
00:28:44,208 --> 00:28:46,208
And, uh, you can skip
the grandpa jokes,

593
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:49,166
because they have
all been made.

594
00:28:49,208 --> 00:28:50,875
Anyway...

595
00:28:50,917 --> 00:28:55,041
My kid, she's, uh...
She's young.

596
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:57,375
She's gonna need
a lot of help.

597
00:28:57,417 --> 00:29:00,041
So I think it's really great

598
00:29:00,083 --> 00:29:03,583
that you get to bring
your baby to work.

599
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:05,583
L.A.'s
a pretty liberal place.

600
00:29:05,625 --> 00:29:07,583
Naomi's
a pretty liberal boss.

601
00:29:07,625 --> 00:29:11,208
You know, I don't think
I've ever even held a baby.

602
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,041
I mean, obviously,
I held lots of kids

603
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:15,041
during my peds rotation
when I was a resident.

604
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:16,834
But I don't--i don't...

605
00:29:16,875 --> 00:29:19,834
I don't think I've ever
even held a baby.

606
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,333
Here.

607
00:29:28,375 --> 00:29:30,625
Go ahead.

608
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:32,041
Okay.

609
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:35,083
Just be gentle.
I just got him quiet.

610
00:29:38,917 --> 00:29:41,500
Hi.

611
00:29:41,542 --> 00:29:43,917
Ooh.

612
00:29:43,959 --> 00:29:46,417
Hello.

613
00:29:46,458 --> 00:29:49,917
Wow, you're cute.

614
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:55,583
Shh. It's okay.

615
00:29:58,583 --> 00:30:01,458
So have I got this straight?

616
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,458
You think my favorite hobby
is sitting around

617
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,166
dreaming up ways
to emasculate you?
You humiliated me

618
00:30:06,208 --> 00:30:08,792
when you bought me into
the practice without asking me.

619
00:30:08,834 --> 00:30:10,792
That made me less of a man.

620
00:30:10,834 --> 00:30:12,792
You made yourself
less of a man

621
00:30:12,834 --> 00:30:15,166
when you spent all the money
in your bank account.

622
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:17,709
You know what? Let's just...
Start over here.

623
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:20,709
No, no, no, no. This is good.
Get it all out. This is good.

624
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:23,083
Charlotte king
finally opens up. Come on.
What's that supposed to mean?

625
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:25,417
I mean, I am there for you
and there for you,

626
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:27,917
but all you want to do
is screw and not talk and--

627
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:30,041
all I want to do is screw?
All I want to do?

628
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:32,750
Oh, you are gonna
have to look in the mirror,

629
00:30:32,792 --> 00:30:35,041
because the pot is definitely
calling the kettle black.

630
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,041
Screw is all you know
how to do.

631
00:30:37,083 --> 00:30:39,041
No, no, no. No, I'm a person.

632
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:41,834
I'm a whole person
with feelings and friends

633
00:30:41,875 --> 00:30:45,333
and a practice full of patients,
and what do you have?
You.

634
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:48,375
Don't you say that like
it's an insult. Don't you dare.

635
00:30:48,417 --> 00:30:51,375
I am not a freak.
I'm not the freak, Charlotte.

636
00:30:51,417 --> 00:30:55,083
I'm not the freak that got fired
because I'm heartless.

637
00:30:55,125 --> 00:30:56,917
Charlotte--

638
00:30:56,959 --> 00:31:00,041
no, you're the freak
who needed me to bail you out,

639
00:31:00,083 --> 00:31:02,166
which is how I know
I'm not heartless.

640
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:05,166
The 50 grand I spent to buy your
ass a place in this practice

641
00:31:05,208 --> 00:31:07,625
proves I am not heartless.
And we're back
to the money again?

642
00:31:07,667 --> 00:31:10,834
You are such a bitch
that you can't--
I do what needs to be done.

643
00:31:10,875 --> 00:31:13,750
I do what needs to be done,
and you resent me.

644
00:31:13,792 --> 00:31:15,959
Why, 'cause I don't go
all crybaby every five seconds?

645
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,959
It's not about crying.
It's not about crying.

646
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,333
It's about being a person.

647
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:22,041
It's about being
a normal woman, for once.

648
00:31:22,083 --> 00:31:24,041
It's not my fault
you're not a man.

649
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:26,375
So don't tell me
I'm not a woman.

650
00:31:31,166 --> 00:31:34,041
I literally--i am full
of hatred right now.

651
00:31:34,083 --> 00:31:36,041
Oh, join the freakin' club.
W--

652
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:39,041
do you know how ridiculous it is
that you would take me aside--

653
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:41,000
could you answer one question?
You can't separate--
I have answered it.

654
00:31:43,667 --> 00:31:45,291
There's the heartbeat.

655
00:31:45,333 --> 00:31:48,875
And it's strong.

656
00:31:50,333 --> 00:31:53,792
So... I have to ask you this.

657
00:31:53,834 --> 00:31:57,375
Has anyone ever talked to you
about adoption?

658
00:31:57,417 --> 00:32:00,041
What, like when you pick
a family from the "pennysaver"?

659
00:32:00,083 --> 00:32:02,041
No. That's just in "juno."

660
00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:04,792
No, in real life,
there are agencies,

661
00:32:04,834 --> 00:32:08,041
and all they do
is screen families.

662
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:10,041
They find you safe,
wonderful families

663
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:13,041
who would love your baby
as much as you do.

664
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:16,041
There are agencies. In fact,
we have one at the practice.

665
00:32:16,083 --> 00:32:18,625
Don't tell Mark that we're
having this conversation,

666
00:32:18,667 --> 00:32:21,041
'cause I know that
he'd freak out, and, like,

667
00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:23,083
all my stuff
is still at his apartment.

668
00:32:23,125 --> 00:32:25,917
No, i'm--I'm your doctor,
so I can't tell anyone

669
00:32:25,959 --> 00:32:27,291
anything
that we're talking about.

670
00:32:27,333 --> 00:32:29,291
And--and for the record,

671
00:32:29,333 --> 00:32:32,041
I think that you could be
a great mom, Sloan,

672
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:34,041
and I know Mark would be
an amazing--

673
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:36,625
so these agencies...

674
00:32:36,667 --> 00:32:39,583
Like, what exactly do they do?

675
00:32:44,417 --> 00:32:46,750
We are breaking up.

676
00:32:46,792 --> 00:32:49,000
Coop, we're having a fight.

677
00:32:49,041 --> 00:32:52,750
No, we're done.

678
00:32:52,792 --> 00:32:54,125
I'm done.

679
00:32:54,166 --> 00:32:56,125
You don't get to be done.

680
00:32:56,166 --> 00:32:59,041
You don't get to decide
what happens to us.
Good-bye, Charlotte.

681
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:01,667
Okay, this...

682
00:33:01,709 --> 00:33:03,875
This is the problem
right here.

683
00:33:03,917 --> 00:33:06,667
You won't man up and face stuff.
You want to just cut and run.

684
00:33:06,709 --> 00:33:09,250
We're having a fight.
No, the problem is...

685
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:11,375
You are a sex toy
I found on the Internet.

686
00:33:11,417 --> 00:33:14,041
The problem is, you're just
a trashy little girl

687
00:33:14,083 --> 00:33:16,041
who's trying to please
her dead daddy,

688
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:19,709
and I shouldn't have
expected much from you.

689
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,917
My bad.

690
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:25,083
You act warm,
all cute, cuddly Cooper.

691
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:28,083
But the bitch of it is,
you're the one who's heartless,

692
00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:30,041
not me.

693
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:32,917
You. You're a mean, cold,
miserable bastard

694
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:35,500
who doesn't know a thing
about forgiveness.

695
00:33:35,542 --> 00:33:37,792

This doesn't make up

You didn't tell me
about your daughter.

720

You didn't tell me because
what happened was unthinkable.

721
00:35:01,458 --> 00:35:04,291
It's unbearable. But this
isn't working anymore, is it?

722
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:06,917
It's not working
to keep away whatever it is

723
00:35:06,959 --> 00:35:09,041
that's eating you
from the inside.

724
00:35:13,083 --> 00:35:16,667
Did you divorce your husband
or the other way around?

How old was your daughter?

726
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,542
How did you find out
they'd been killed?

727
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:22,542
Did you have to identify
the bodies?

728
00:35:22,583 --> 00:35:25,041
How did you tell Cody that his
father and his sister were dead?

729
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:26,875
I divorced him, okay?

730
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:28,583
I didn't love him anymore.

731
00:35:28,625 --> 00:35:31,083
He was a good husband
and a good father, but I...

732
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:33,083
I tossed him out
like a sack of garbage.

733
00:35:33,125 --> 00:35:35,583
And if I hadn't done that,
then my daughter

734
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:39,333
wouldn't have been in that car
in that place at that time.
You don't know that.

735
00:35:39,375 --> 00:35:41,375
I do know that.

736
00:35:42,959 --> 00:35:45,959
You want this gone?

737
00:35:54,542 --> 00:35:56,000
There.

738
00:35:58,125 --> 00:36:00,041
How about that?

739
00:36:00,083 --> 00:36:02,291
How about this?

740
00:36:10,792 --> 00:36:14,333
Maddy was 4 1/2.

741
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:17,542
She wanted to stay with Cody
because he was sick,

742
00:36:17,583 --> 00:36:20,542
but I made her go with her
father because I felt guilty

743
00:36:20,583 --> 00:36:25,041
because he only got them
on the weekends.

744
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:28,208
And he loved them
more than anything!

745
00:36:29,667 --> 00:36:31,625
He loved them,
and he loved me,

746
00:36:31,667 --> 00:36:33,959
and I didn't want him!

747
00:36:35,625 --> 00:36:38,542
No. No, they can't.

748
00:36:38,583 --> 00:36:41,667
No, they can't take Cody.

749
00:36:41,709 --> 00:36:44,166
They can't take him.
They can't take him.

750
00:36:44,208 --> 00:36:46,166
Hey, hey, hey.
Did you see what you did?

751
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:49,250
You threw stuff out.
Can you leave it out there?

752
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:52,000
Can you do that?
I think so.

753
00:36:53,458 --> 00:36:55,875
I'm Ellie farraday,
d.C.F.S.

754
00:36:55,917 --> 00:37:00,041
Hi, Ellie. We're just doing
a little housecleaning.

755
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:19,333
I'm sorry.

756
00:37:20,959 --> 00:37:23,917
For everything,
I'm sorry.

757
00:37:23,959 --> 00:37:27,000
That's quite a punch
you've got.

758
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:33,917
You coming?

759
00:37:33,959 --> 00:37:36,417
Oh, no. I'm just riding
up and down.

760
00:37:36,458 --> 00:37:38,917
Lucas likes the motion.
Yeah.

761
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:43,083
You like the motion.

762
00:37:46,792 --> 00:37:49,709
I don't care what Sam says.
This is ideal.

763
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:52,125
What did Sam say?

764
00:37:52,166 --> 00:37:54,625
Nothing.
Forget about Sam.

765
00:37:54,667 --> 00:37:56,875
This is ideal.

766
00:37:56,917 --> 00:37:58,417
Three parents--

767
00:37:58,458 --> 00:38:00,500
no one gets overwhelmed,

768
00:38:00,542 --> 00:38:03,500
everyone still gets
to have a life.
Mark--

769
00:38:03,542 --> 00:38:07,041
this is our second chance.
Don't you see it?

770
00:38:07,083 --> 00:38:09,041
What if there wasn't
a baby?

771
00:38:09,083 --> 00:38:10,750
Why? What happened?

772
00:38:10,792 --> 00:38:12,792
Nothing. Nothing happened.
The baby's fine.

773
00:38:12,834 --> 00:38:16,041
It's just, what...

774
00:38:16,083 --> 00:38:19,458
What if Sloan changed her mind
or there wasn't a baby,

775
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,333
would you still want
to move down here,

776
00:38:22,375 --> 00:38:24,959
join the practice,
be with me?

777
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,542
Because you keep asking,
and you paint a pretty picture.

778
00:38:28,583 --> 00:38:31,542
And I'm just lonely enough
and I'm just scared enough

779
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:35,875
and I'm just freaked out enough
that if you ask me again...

780
00:38:35,917 --> 00:38:38,125
I might say yes.

781
00:38:38,166 --> 00:38:42,375
So I'm asking you
not to ask me again

782
00:38:42,417 --> 00:38:44,125
if it's not about me.

783
00:38:44,166 --> 00:38:47,166
If you're just heartbroken
or in love with someone else

784
00:38:47,208 --> 00:38:50,166
or you just want me
to help you with a baby

785
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:53,166
that you may or may not
be able to raise...

786
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:55,792
Don't ask me.

787
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:58,083
Because I don't know...
Anything.

788
00:38:58,125 --> 00:39:01,709
I don't know...
Anything anymore,

789
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:05,500
except, I can't fall in love
with a man

790
00:39:05,542 --> 00:39:07,500
who's in love
with someone else.

791
00:39:07,542 --> 00:39:09,500
That much I know.
I can't do that again.

792
00:39:09,542 --> 00:39:12,500
So please, if you're still
in love with the grey girl,

793
00:39:12,542 --> 00:39:14,125
then go back to Seattle.

794
00:39:14,166 --> 00:39:18,041
But if you're not...

795
00:39:18,083 --> 00:39:22,750
I mean, if you're serious...

796
00:39:22,792 --> 00:39:25,834
And you want me...

797
00:39:25,875 --> 00:39:29,792
