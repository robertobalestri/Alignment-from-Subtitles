No, no, surgery.

Yeah, amazing, right?

I felt invincible.

make a decision about Naomi.

00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:36,458
If we're not gonna replace her,
I think we should

at least have a talk.
About buying out her shares?
Yeah.

14
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:41,458
I was thinking the same thing,
and I came up with a figure.

I was thinking about making
the suggestion today.
Perfect.

You know what? Even without
adding someone,

17
00:00:45,917 --> 00:00:48,750
we could still have another

Good. Yeah.
Let's get you to a room.

47
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:11,375
Welcome back.

48
00:02:11,417 --> 00:02:13,375
He doesn't even look at me.

49
00:02:13,417 --> 00:02:15,000
That is not true.

50
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:17,583
Okay, it feels like
you don't look at me.

51
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,709
It's just...

52
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,542
Ever since...

53
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:26,709
The rape.
It's okay to say it.

54
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,083
Sometimes that can help.

55
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:31,709
I think if you could
work on saying it--

56
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,041
I don't want to keep
bringing it up.

57
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:36,709
Collette, she's--
you think
if you don't bring it up,

58
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,083
I'm gonna forget
it happened?

59
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,125
That's the thing, Ty.
It's there. It happened.

60
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:43,125
And if you're not able to deal
with what collette went through,

61
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:47,959
then you and she aren't gonna be
able to move forward together.

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,166
Okay.

63
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:52,542
Well...
I'll see you next week.

64
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:56,333
Uh, Ty. Meet me
by the elevators.

65
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,542
I have to stop by
the ladies room.

66
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:00,834
Sure.

67
00:03:02,792 --> 00:03:04,625
I, um...

68
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:06,625
I-I took
a home pregnancy test.

69
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:09,041
You're pregnant? That's...

70
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,959
You guys have wanted that
for so long.

71
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,041
You're having feelings
about telling Ty?

72
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,166
No, it's just, um...

73
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm eight weeks.

74
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,583
Dr. Turner...

75
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:22,792
I don't know
who I'm pregnant by...

76
00:03:22,834 --> 00:03:25,041
My husband...

77
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:27,000
Or the man who raped me.

78
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:37,041
- She didn't even look at him.
- Nothing?

79
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,000
She looked through him.
She's having a hard time.

80
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,542
She's gonna come around.

81
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:43,917
So I have a patient who
doesn't know if she's pregnant

82
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:46,583
by her husband
or the man who raped her.

83
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:47,917
Oof.

84
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:50,291
Since when did you start
wearing ties to work?

85
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,917
What's the occasion?

86
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:53,500
No occasion. I wear ties.

87
00:03:53,542 --> 00:03:56,000
Occasion. It's volunteer
clinic day at the shelter.

88
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,208
And I've recruited Coop and Sam
to come down there with me.

89
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,417
So you didn't need me?

90
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:03,792
Oh, no, no, no.
I-I just figured that--

91
00:04:03,834 --> 00:04:06,250
I'm seeing patients, Addison.
I am fine.

92
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:09,917
So, uh, listen, by the way,
since we're all here.

93
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,917
There is something
we need to discuss.

94
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:14,709
Since we decided
not to replace Naomi,

95
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,041
uh, we need to buy out
her shares.

96
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,959
What do we need to do?

97
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,125
We each need to put in
$50,000 to the practice,

98
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:26,250
and then we'll be
equal partners.
50 grand?

99
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,041
- Check okay?
- Check is perfect.

100
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:31,458
I could do mine.
Good. Great.
Oh, come on, guys.

101
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,625
It's an investment
in our future.
Sure, whatever you need.

102
00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:38,709
It's fine.
All right, so if we can just get
checks by the end of the day,

103
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,041
I'll get
all the paperwork rolling.

104
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,667
Okay. I will write mine...
Right now.

105
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:02,041
Okeydoke,
we have, uh, tampons,

106
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:05,125
condoms and a sample
of birth control pills, so--

107
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:08,583
we hitched here about
a month ago from Portland. No.

108
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:11,041
I tried out Seattle
and Tacoma,

109
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:13,083
but I realized,
if you're gonna be homeless,

110
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,041
you might as well be warm.
Hey.

111
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,041
You know, it would be great

112
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,959
if, uh, you and Elliot
could get checkups more often.

113
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,083
There is medi-Cal.
Yeah, you--you need
documents and I.D.

114
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:26,291
Well, I could help you
track down your documents.

115
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:29,041
You know what? It's okay.
We'll make it.

116
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,041
Danielle, um,
how old are you?

117
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:34,083
15.
And there's no one,
no family?

118
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,917
Well, I-I got a mom.

119
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:38,041
She's out of the picture.

120
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:41,041
If I wanted to keep my baby,
I had to leave.

121
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:44,583
But we're good. You know,
I take care of us.

122
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:47,166
It's been hard...
But we're lucky.

123
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:50,375
You know, we have each other.

124
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,000
Well, sometimes...
Look, mom.

125
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:54,000
That's all that matters,
huh?

126
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,959
Huh?
He's had a runny nose
for weeks.

127
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,542
I mean,
I gave him cold medicine.

128
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,834
It just won't go away.
Well, he's got
a little fever.

129
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,041
Let me just have
our pediatrician take a look.

130
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:06,333
Okay.
Okay? Coop.

131
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,625
Oh.

132
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:10,625
Hi.
Danielle, this is,
uh, coo--Dr. Freedman.

133
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:12,625
Hi.
And this is Elliot. He's 2.

134
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:15,792
He's got a little runny nose
and it feels like a fever.
Can I take a look at you?

135
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:18,041
Come on now.

136
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:22,041
Hey, when we get done,
you want to go to the park?

137
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,417
Let me see here.

138
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:30,000
How long has he had this?
Oh, the rash?

139
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,375
Yeah.
Um, a few days, maybe.

140
00:06:32,417 --> 00:06:34,625
It's not something serious,
is it?

141
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:36,625
Um, we should--
we should probably

142
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:40,583
get him back to the practice,
do an E.K.G. now.

143
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:43,208
I was so sure
it was time.

144
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:47,000
It will be. You just--
you just have to wait.

145
00:06:48,417 --> 00:06:50,000
Hey, uh...

146
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,375
Your first patient back?

147
00:06:51,417 --> 00:06:53,041
Yeah. Uh, false alarm,
though.

148
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,625
Oh, hey, I-I heard
about Lucas, that he's yours.

149
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:57,041
Congratulations.

150
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,041
Hey, Dell.
Do you have a minute?

151
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,667
I need to get
a-a c.V.S. Test done.

152
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:03,834
Yeah, sure.

153
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,750
There. See?

154
00:07:08,792 --> 00:07:12,041
Tiny aneurysms
on his coronary arteries.

155
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,041
Blood vessels to his heart
are inflamed.

156
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:17,125
So it's kawasaki syndrome. It
explains the erythematous rash.

157
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,667
So this kid's homeless
with a heart condition.

158
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:22,291
So we treat it
with immunoglobulins.
It could help, but it's not
a definitive repair.

159
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:25,041
Yeah, but it's the first line
of treatment, right?

160
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:28,917
What?
I mean, his mother can't even
afford a place to live,

161
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:31,875
and now she's gonna have a son
that could continue to get sick.

162
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:34,667
I-i--I'm worried.
I-I would like to do more.
Like what?

163
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:37,542
I could fix it--
a bypass procedure.

164
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,709
Sam, I know
you just did surgery--

165
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,083
well, hey, wait, it was
an amazing surgery.

166
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,166
Yes,
but there's a process.

167
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,375
You can't just jump back
into surgery overnight.

168
00:07:46,417 --> 00:07:48,500
The boy has a heart problem,

169
00:07:48,542 --> 00:07:52,250
a heart problem that you and I
both know nobody else will touch

170
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:55,250
because there's no money in it.
Sam, you're jumping the gun
on this.

171
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:57,875
Maybe I am,
but... I mean, I look at her,

172
00:07:57,917 --> 00:08:00,959
and she should be in school
with Maya, and she's not.

173
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,041
She's not. She's alone,
and it's wrong.

174
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,291
Can we run her social,
get an address,

175
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,250
try to call the mother?

176
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:09,291
We don't know the situation.
She may be a runaway.

177
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,041
But she could've been
abused or molested.

178
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:13,709
Okay, we are not going to
put her in danger,

179
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,500
but she is a kid on the street,
in over her head

180
00:08:16,542 --> 00:08:19,041
with a sick baby.
Well, not everyone's rich
with a perfect life.

181
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:22,417
What does that mean?
I don't--it just means
we... I don't know.

182
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,625
Let's find the mom.

183
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:27,000
You guys...

184
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:34,041
What? Why are we here?
Did something--

185
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:38,625
i'm... pregnant, Ty.

186
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:40,834
And, um, there's--
you're pregnant?

187
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,667
So I'm gonna be
a father?

188
00:08:43,709 --> 00:08:46,583
Th-this is great. This--
this is what we wanted.

189
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,959
I know it's been awful.
I've been awful.

190
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,792
But it's like
a new start, baby.

191
00:08:52,834 --> 00:08:55,041
We ran a paternity test.

192
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:58,166
It turns out that
you're not the...

193
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,041
No.

194
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:03,125
No! It's his?

195
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,542
Ty, I-I know this is awful.

196
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,792
How soon can we abort?

197
00:09:07,834 --> 00:09:10,000
Mm.

198
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,750
Now she's not looking at me.
Now she's not talking.

199
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:15,208
Collette,
what are you thinking?

200
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,875
It--it--it's awful.
I know it is.

201
00:09:17,917 --> 00:09:21,625
But--but--but we've been trying
for so long to have a baby.

202
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:24,417
And--and this isn't how
I imagined it could happen,

203
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:26,917
but this could be our chance.
Our chance?

204
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,083
Yeah, babe...

205
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,583
You're thinking about
having him?

206
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,834
After that pig did--

207
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,583
you r--after he raped you?

208
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,917
Look, there, I said it.
He raped you!

209
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:43,667
And you want him inside you
for another nine months?

210
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:47,166
No.

211
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:05,417
Violet?

212
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:09,041
Oh, hey.
Naomi asked me to come
downstairs for a consult.

213
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,291
Do you mind watching Lucas?

214
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,917
Uh, I'm sorry.

215
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,917
I'm in the middle
of a situation.

216
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,917
That husband just found out

217
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,917
his wife is pregnant
by her rapist.

218
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,417
So i'm--I'm way behind
in patient notes.
You have time.

219
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,458
Lucas will not be insulted

220
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,417
if you do a little work
while he's visiting.

221
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,583
Naomi, if Violet asks,

222
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,583
I'm here to consult
on a case for you.

223
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,583
What am I an excuse for?

224
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,583
So I can leave
the baby with her.

225
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,583
Come on.
I have to do something.

226
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:50,000
I figured if I brought
Lucas to work,

227
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:53,000
she'd be forced to see him,
and maybe--
uh, I don't know that forcing
her to bond with the baby

228
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:56,000
is gonna be
such a good idea.
Look, I don't expect
a miracle,

229
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,083
but maybe if she just
got curious,

230
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:01,291
something to remind her
that she has a son with me.

231
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:04,041
Am I crazy?

232
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:09,000
Trust me. Chocolate cures
almost everything.

233
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:13,917
This place is nice.
You've done well.

234
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:16,709
Yeah, yeah, it's nice.
It's a little quiet.

235
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,083
Well, quiet's good.
No, no, yeah, quiet is fine.

236
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:20,709
Quiet is professional.

237
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,041
But it's... I don't know,
it's a little weird.

238
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,792
Everyone's always holed up
in their offices working,

239
00:11:25,834 --> 00:11:27,792
and I just kinda...
I feel like...

240
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:30,458
They treat me like--
The boss?

241
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,417
Exactly.

242
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,041
You're on my turf.

243
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,834
You have turf?

244
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,834
Work is turf. You've got Violet.
You've got Lucas.

245
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:41,125
I'm out of the picture,
and I'm dealing with it.

246
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,125
But you being here
at my work?

247
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:45,458
That is not part of
my program.

248
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,417
So I will ask you
to leave, please.
Sheldon.

249
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:51,750
Uh, it--it's okay.
I'll talk to you later.

250
00:11:51,792 --> 00:11:54,000
Turf?

251
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:01,041
I'm fine. Just working my way
through the grieving process.

252
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,041
Denial never lasts
very long with me.

253
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:05,792
The anger does,
but I'm past it.

254
00:12:05,834 --> 00:12:08,375
And frankly, I'm too busy
with work to be depressed,

255
00:12:08,417 --> 00:12:10,375
and as far
as acceptance goes...

256
00:12:10,417 --> 00:12:12,375
Well, screw acceptance.

257
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:16,000
But really,
I feel, um... fine.

258
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,792
You want to eat
some chocolate with me?

259
00:12:18,834 --> 00:12:20,000
Yeah.

260
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:34,000
Do you always
stuff your feelings with food?

261
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,458
Yes.

262
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,041
Interesting.

263
00:12:39,542 --> 00:12:42,417
I found the mother--
Danielle's mother.

264
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:45,625
That's... great.
I have got Sam
and Violet's check.

265
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:49,041
I can get yours, too,
and get it in the account.
Right now?

266
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,417
It's for the practice,
for our practice.

267
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:54,834
I need to get the checks by--
by the end of the day.

268
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:58,417
Right. Oh. Do you need
until later in the week?

269
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:02,125
A little later in the week?
A little later in the week.

270
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:04,750
What? What, Cooper?

271
00:13:04,792 --> 00:13:07,041
Not everyone has
a $30-million trust fund.

272
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,125
Oh.

273
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,875
Oh.

274
00:13:09,917 --> 00:13:11,291
Okay, i--okay--

275
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:14,000
no, no, no, it...
Forget it.

276
00:13:20,417 --> 00:13:23,125
That's a lot of tubes.

277
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:25,041
Are they hurting him?

278
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,875
No, no, the tubes
aren't hurting him.

279
00:13:27,917 --> 00:13:30,792
That's how he gets
his medicine.
He's never stayed
a night away from me.

280
00:13:30,834 --> 00:13:34,458
And if I'm not back
at the shelter by 8:00--
okay, you can stay in there
with him.

281
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,375
We'll get you all set up.
I'll speak to the nurses.

282
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:39,792
Okay.
Okay.

283
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:44,291
So we'll, uh, we'll see
what the--what the meds do.

284
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:47,583
I really think that surgery
would be a better option.

285
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:50,792
Not until the mom gets here.
I called her--the mom.

286
00:13:50,834 --> 00:13:53,000
She is on her way.
Okay.

287
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,000
Am I an ass...

288
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:57,291
A callous, oblivious ass?

289
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:59,417
What exactly
are we talking about here?
Cooper.

290
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:03,041
Cooper called you an ass?
He yelled at me about money.

291
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,959
Oh, that.
What? What?

292
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,834
Nothing. It's just...
You're a rich kid, Addison.

293
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:11,333
You grew up with money.
You never had to worry about it.

294
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,625
The rest of us,
it's not so easy.

295
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:16,208
But we're all doctors.
I mean, you backed me on this.

296
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,250
Yeah, because it's what
we need to do for the practice.

297
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,250
And it just so happens
that I could write the check.

298
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,875
So I am an ass.

299
00:14:24,917 --> 00:14:27,333
You could be
a little bit more sensitive.

300
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:30,375
Kind of like, because you're
this world-class surgeon,

301
00:14:30,417 --> 00:14:33,375
you don't see how telling me
I can't operate on this kid

302
00:14:33,417 --> 00:14:36,041
might be cutting my legs
from underneath me.
I didn't.

303
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,917
Well, you did.

304
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,333
Wh-what--what...

305
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:52,041
What... what's going on
right now?

306
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:55,000
Faucet drip was going on
all night.

307
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:57,917
It was driving me bonkers.
And so you decided
to tear up my bathroom?

308
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:00,041
New marble counters, hardwood
floors, recessed lighting.

309
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,917
Oh, you swept me off
my feet and dragged me here,

310
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,291
but don't expect me to live
in a manhole.

311
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,291
Bulldozing my bathroom
to avoid going to work

312
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,917
and dealing with your problems
is not cool.

313
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:13,208
This is so not cool.
What are you doing home
so early, Coop,

314
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,834
hangdog look?

315
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,834
Good. We're two peas
in a pod.

316
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,875
Now there's
dry rot that's a mess.

317
00:15:19,917 --> 00:15:23,458
Receipts are on the table.
You can write me a check.
For what?

318
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,500
To pay for all this.

319
00:15:25,542 --> 00:15:28,834
Damn it, Charlotte. You really
should not have done this.

320
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,041
Ah. Oh.

321
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,625
No contractions,
just like this morning.

322
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:37,667
Uh... but I feel it.

323
00:15:37,709 --> 00:15:41,041
No, no, no. It's all
right here, and she's due.

324
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:43,125
My daughter?
A week overdue.

325
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,333
And I'm about to
pick her up from school.

326
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:48,834
It'll happen
when it's supposed to, okay?
But what if something bad
happens when I get home,

327
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,834
like she ends up breeched

328
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,834
or I have her in the tub
and she drowns?
Kimmie, your baby
will be fine.

329
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,250
How can you be sure?
My husband's not around.

330
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:59,458
I have tons of questions
I need answered.

331
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,542
Hey, look! I paid
for the midwife experience,

332
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,667
and you haven't been around.

333
00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:08,583
Okay, okay. Let's, uh, let's
go over some of your questions.

334
00:16:19,709 --> 00:16:23,041
You just left Lucas
sitting there?

335
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,125
He hasn't cried.
But he's awake, Violet.

336
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:28,041
Didn't you want to pick him up
and play with him?

337
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:30,667
No, I'm working, Pete.
I'm at work, working.

338
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,083
You're his mother.

339
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:38,000
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

340
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,166
Violet.

341
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:05,250
Charlotte is taking out
her problems on my bathroom.

342
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,250
She needs to be stopped.

343
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,250
So I need to
hide this here before...

344
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:12,000
I just can't let her destroy
anything else.

345
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,166
Why are we staring
at the floor?

346
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:20,041
I've been trying for weeks to
get the blood out of the wood,

347
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,041
and nothing works.

348
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:25,834
I've tried every brand.
That's my fifth bottle.

349
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:29,542
So... if Charlotte was raped

350
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,542
and ended up getting pregnant
by her rapist

351
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,542
and decided to keep the baby,

352
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,834
that would be a deal breaker
for you, right?

353
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:38,792
Do not hypothetically
rape my girlfriend. I don't--
the couple--
the woman that was raped--

354
00:17:38,834 --> 00:17:40,792
she wants to keep her--
the rapist's baby.

355
00:17:40,834 --> 00:17:43,375
She wants to keep the baby?
Yeah. That's just crazy,
right?

356
00:17:43,417 --> 00:17:45,375
I think I'm gonna tell her
it's crazy.

357
00:17:45,417 --> 00:17:47,792
I mean, I know it's not my job
to make decisions for people,

358
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:49,667
but--you know, it's not fair.

359
00:17:49,709 --> 00:17:52,208
Pediatricians--
you get to diagnose,

360
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,417
you get to tell people
what to do.

361
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:57,625
I'm supposed to just sit back
and let people figure it out.
Help them
figure it out. Right.

362
00:17:57,667 --> 00:17:59,834
I mean, the point is,
it's wrong, right?

363
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,000
Right. I think.

364
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:09,041
Hey, did you actually
write Addison a check?

365
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,709
Violet.

366
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:23,333
Do you think it's working?

367
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:26,250
Yeah, maybe a little.

368
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:29,417
How could she look
at this face

369
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,041
and not melt?

370
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,834
She's not looking.
I'm--I'm out of ideas.

371
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:36,041
Was I not clear?

372
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,500
Sheldon--
I realize you're not
a trained therapist, Pete,

373
00:18:38,542 --> 00:18:40,959
but I would think that
a doctor such as yourself

374
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,709
would understand boundaries.
Uh, Sheldon.

375
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,125
No, Naomi, please. This is
my battle, not yours.

376
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:50,375
We're not battling, Sheldon.
Naomi's my friend--
no, no, no. My friend.
I call Naomi.

377
00:18:50,417 --> 00:18:53,542
What?
No, he gets the girl.
He gets the baby. I get you.

378
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:56,041
You're my friend.
Now get off our floor.

379
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,458
Pete, I'll--I'll just--
I'll see you later.

380
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,583
Go ahead and go, okay?
Yeah, but sh--

381
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,917
just go.

382
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:07,083
For the record, I may not be
fully over the anger part.

383
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,875
Maybe not.

384
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:16,041
Danielle.

385
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,291
Danielle.

386
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,291
Wait. What are you
doing here?

387
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,333
You look so thin.

388
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:25,041
I'm fine, mom.
Wait. Who called her?

389
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,083
Who called her?

390
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,417
Who--
Danielle, I called.

391
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:32,083
I looked and I looked for you,
but you were just gone.

392
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,041
Oh, he's beautiful.

393
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:36,417
He looks like you
when you were a baby.

394
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:39,041
Don't touch him.

395
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:41,500
Danielle, you can
come home now. I don't--

396
00:19:41,542 --> 00:19:43,917
you brought her here?
How could you do that?

397
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:45,959
Danielle, Danielle, she--
she was trying to help.

398
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,041
Help? She dragged me
to an abortion clinic.

399
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:50,041
And when I wouldn't do it,

400
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:53,166
she said I had to
give him up for adoption.

401
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:56,041
I don't want her here.
Danielle,
please don't do this.

402
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,041
Fine. Fine.
Please--

403
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:02,000
if she won't leave,
then I will.
Just stay. Just stay.

404
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,875
You told me so.

405
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,875
Let's just hope
we find 'em, okay?

406
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:12,875
Look, I'm sorry, Coop,
about the money.

407
00:20:12,917 --> 00:20:15,875
I mean, I wasn't trying
to be an ass, you know?

408
00:20:15,917 --> 00:20:19,000
And if--if you're not liquid,
I could front you the money.

409
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,125
It's not a problem. What?

410
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,041
I don't want your money.
But--

411
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,500
and I really don't want
to talk about it.

412
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,625
Shh, baby.

413
00:20:30,667 --> 00:20:33,166
- Danielle!
- Danielle.

414
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:36,083
How long's he been like this?
Over an hour. It's fine.
He's just--he's hungry, okay?

415
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:38,083
He always cries like this
when he's hungry.

416
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,500
We were just too loud inside.

417
00:20:40,542 --> 00:20:42,625
I was scared
I was gonna get kicked out.

418
00:20:42,667 --> 00:20:44,500
Come on.
Be a good boy, okay?

419
00:20:44,542 --> 00:20:46,709
I-I got some pudding
from the hospital.

420
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,166
I took it off the trays.
Do you think he'll take that?
Danielle, Danielle,
listen to me.

421
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,041
If there's something wrong
with him,

422
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,583
pudding is not going to help.
Can you let me check him?

423
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:57,041
Let me--let me just check him,
just real quick.
Okay?

424
00:20:57,083 --> 00:21:00,291
Okay? It's okay.
Shh, shh, shh.

425
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,542
Okay.
That's a good boy.

426
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,041
Shh.

427
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:06,250
It's okay.

428
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:08,625
Okay, call 9-1-1.

429
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:11,458
Lay him here. Come on.
It's okay.

430
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,458
- You're okay.
- Just stay with us, okay?

431
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,625
He never came home.

432
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:21,041
I haven't seen him
since he left here.

433
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:23,041
Well, he's working
through this.

434
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,041
He doesn't understand
why...

435
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,041
Why you would consider this.

436
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,709
I know. I love Ty.

437
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,417
We were summer camp counselors
together.

438
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:34,542
We were perfect, but...

439
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,041
But?

440
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,834
But I'm having a baby.

441
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,083
A-And you really think
that you're up

442
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,250
to putting yourself
through this?

443
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:48,041
Well... yeah.

444
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:50,041
Maybe.

445
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,291
What...
You don't think I am?

446
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,917
Well, I know you want
to have a child,

447
00:21:54,959 --> 00:21:58,041
but do you understand
what life is gonna be like,

448
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,041
seeing that baby every day?

449
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:03,875
Every time you see it,
it's gonna be like a recording

450
00:22:03,917 --> 00:22:06,709
playing over and over
in your mind.

451
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:11,583
So you'll... remember
lying there feeling helpless.

452
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:14,041
You will remember him
standing over you

453
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,208
and touching you.

454
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:20,291
You will remember...
Screaming your lungs out,

455
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:22,291
screaming until you're hoarse,

456
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:24,083
hoping and praying

457
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:27,083
that somebody will come
and find you.

458
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:29,709
But nobody is coming.

459
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:33,083
And then comes
the unbearable pain.

460
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:36,709
And then you feel yourself
passing out,

461
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,750
but before you do, you wonder
if you'll ever wake up again,

462
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:41,750
and part of you hopes
that you never will.

463
00:22:41,792 --> 00:22:43,750
So all of that...

464
00:22:43,792 --> 00:22:47,583
All of that will be
staring at you every day.

465
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:51,583
Do you really think
that you can look at that?

466
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:57,500
Oh, my god.

467
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,000
Oh, my...

468
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:09,333
Oh, my god.

469
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:12,792
Oh, my god.

470
00:23:12,834 --> 00:23:14,792
Collette.

471
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:25,375
One of the aneurysms
must have ruptured.
This doesn't make any sense.

472
00:23:25,417 --> 00:23:28,375
That medicine that you gave me,
you said it would work.
We wanted it to work.

473
00:23:28,417 --> 00:23:31,041
The last thing we wanted to do,
Danielle, is put you and Elliot

474
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:34,792
through anything more
than we had to.
But you--
you can fix him, right?

475
00:23:34,834 --> 00:23:36,417
Well, there are a few things

476
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:39,834
we could do for Elliot,
one of which is bypass surgery.

477
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:42,667
That's where we take a vein that
goes around the damaged vessel.

478
00:23:42,709 --> 00:23:45,041
Or we could insert a stent.
What's a stent?

479
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:47,458
That's experimental
in kids his age.

480
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,250
We put a tiny tube in the vessel
to keep it open.

481
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:52,458
I mean, they--
they both sound good.

482
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,458
I...
What am I supposed to do?

483
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,834
Well, uh, bypass surgery.

484
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:02,000
It's the right treatment,
he needs it, and I'll do it.

485
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:06,291
I'll do the surgery.
That sounds good.

486
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:07,917
I trust you. You...

487
00:24:07,959 --> 00:24:10,125
All right.
Do the surgery.

488
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:12,709
Can I see Elliot?

489
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:16,041
Sure.
Sure, yeah.
I'll take you to him.

490
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:17,750
Okay.

491
00:24:17,792 --> 00:24:21,291
I know what you're gonna say,
but I couldn't stand there

492
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:23,458
and watch that girl
be so confused.

493
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,542
I can do this surgery.

494
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:27,917
It's your call.

495
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:35,083
Ty.

496
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:36,709
Thanks for seeing me.

497
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:39,375
I just wanted to come by
and say thank you.

498
00:24:39,417 --> 00:24:40,917
For?

499
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:42,917
For talking sense
into collette.

500
00:24:42,959 --> 00:24:44,959
She scheduled an abortion
for tomorrow.

501
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,750

She's sure?

502
00:24:47,792 --> 00:24:49,291
She is now.

503
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:51,375
I don't know
what you said to her--

504
00:24:51,417 --> 00:24:53,125
she wouldn't listen to me--

505
00:24:53,166 --> 00:24:54,792
but thank you.

506
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,959
Oh.
Violet. H-Hello.

507
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,709
Were you--were you
looking for me?
Pete, actually.

508
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:09,709
I just wanted to finish
a conversation we were having.

509
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,709
I had some final
choice words for him.

510
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,083
Uh, hey. I'm sorry.

511
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:16,542
Violet, I-I have a-a patient
in labor again,

512
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:18,542
and Betsey's waiting
for me at school,

513
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:22,041
and I can't find Pete,
so can, um, can you just...

514
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:24,917
Go ahead and... help?

515
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:26,041
Here.

516
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:28,041
Yeah, thanks. Okay.
Got him?

517
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:32,875
Okay. Uh, no, you can't go
into labor from burping, kimmie.

518
00:25:32,917 --> 00:25:35,166
So, Violet--

519
00:25:35,208 --> 00:25:37,834
it was good to see you.

520
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:44,291
Hey.

521
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:49,125
Oh, hi. Uh, thank you
for answering my page.

522
00:25:49,166 --> 00:25:52,166
Uh, he's getting prepped
for surgery right now.

523
00:25:52,208 --> 00:25:53,834
Okay.

524
00:25:53,875 --> 00:25:57,417
Danielle could... barely
take care of herself.

525
00:25:57,458 --> 00:25:59,417
I was always getting her
out of trouble.

526
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:02,417
You know, she has a real knack
for making mistakes.

527
00:26:02,458 --> 00:26:04,417
Yeah. Well, we all do.

528
00:26:04,458 --> 00:26:07,250
I know, but dragging
that poor boy around

529
00:26:07,291 --> 00:26:11,041
with no roof over their heads,
no safe place, I just--

530
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:14,792
I want better for my grandson.
I can afford better.

531
00:26:14,834 --> 00:26:17,792
I have spoken to my attorney,
and after the surgery,

532
00:26:17,834 --> 00:26:20,166
I'm gonna petition the court
for custody.

533
00:26:20,208 --> 00:26:24,583
He doesn't think
there'll be a problem.
Don't you?
Taking Elliot away from her?

534
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:27,667
She's a child.
I'm the mother.

535
00:26:27,709 --> 00:26:30,166
Okay...

536
00:26:30,208 --> 00:26:33,166
I'm gonna say something to you
which I've never said,

537
00:26:33,208 --> 00:26:34,834
well, to anyone before.

538
00:26:34,875 --> 00:26:36,834
And I apologize
for how it sounds,

539
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:39,291
but... you're an ass.

540
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:41,542
What?
You're a good person,

541
00:26:41,583 --> 00:26:43,542
a-and you're right,
you are a mother,

542
00:26:43,583 --> 00:26:46,125
but Danielle
is a mother now, too.

543
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:49,625
And I believe that you want
what's best for your daughter,

544
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:51,625
but sometimes,
even when we mean well,

545
00:26:51,667 --> 00:26:53,625
we end up hurting people.

546
00:26:53,667 --> 00:26:56,291
I'm just saying,
think about Danielle.

547
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:59,875
Think about what Danielle
thinks about you.

548
00:27:03,792 --> 00:27:05,750
Um, right now...

549
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:09,792
I have to think for her,
not about her.

550
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:16,542
You're not in labor.

551
00:27:16,583 --> 00:27:18,041
I feel contractions.

552
00:27:18,083 --> 00:27:20,458
Look, I was sure
I lost my mucus plug.

553
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,458
Yeah, maybe you should
check it again.

554
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,458
Y-You just need to go home,
kimmie, and be patient.
I can't,

555
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,750
because it's gonna happen,
and I'm gonna be there alone,

556
00:27:28,792 --> 00:27:30,750
and I'm not gonna know
what to do.

557
00:27:30,792 --> 00:27:32,750
I'm staying here
because I know.

558
00:27:32,792 --> 00:27:35,083
I don't care what you see
on that monitor.

559
00:27:35,125 --> 00:27:38,083
I know this baby is coming
today. I'm not leaving, Dell.

560
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:42,041
I'm having my baby.
Okay, uh, y-you can't force her
to come before she's ready.

561
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:44,125
You can't read a book
and know what's happening.

562
00:27:44,166 --> 00:27:46,750
I am trained. I am trained
to tell you what to do.

563
00:27:46,792 --> 00:27:48,750
And I can't sit here
and wait with you

564
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,750
and babysit you
until she comes, okay?

565
00:27:50,792 --> 00:27:53,291
I'm not your babysitter.
I'm your midwife.

566
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:55,291
And you're not
my only responsibility.

567
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:58,083
And if you can't be patient,
if you can't deal with waiting,

568
00:27:58,125 --> 00:28:00,875
then are you really gonna be
ready for her when she comes,

569
00:28:00,917 --> 00:28:02,709
when she's crying
and begging you to stay

570
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,709
and you've got a thousand
other things you gotta do,

571
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,041
like I've got a thousand
other things I've gotta do?

572
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:09,125
You're not
my only priority, okay?

573
00:28:09,166 --> 00:28:12,041
So you need to pull it together
and be patient.

574
00:28:12,083 --> 00:28:13,959
Take your little book
and go home

575
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,250
and don't come back
until it's really time!

576
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,041
Hey.

577
00:28:19,083 --> 00:28:21,166
Good luck.

578
00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:25,000

for thinking I can do this?

It doesn't matter
what I think.

581
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:30,542
You made your decision.
Surgeons step up, Sam.

582
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,542
They don't question.
They don't doubt.

583
00:28:32,583 --> 00:28:34,542
They don't let other people
decide for them

584
00:28:34,583 --> 00:28:37,166
what is right
or what is wrong.

585
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:40,542
Be a surgeon or don't be
a surgeon, but don't do this.

586
00:28:40,583 --> 00:28:44,750
Don't waver. You told Danielle
that you could do this.

587
00:28:44,792 --> 00:28:47,458
You need to do it. Now go.

Violet really doesn't
look at him, does she?

593
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,417
It's hard to watch.
Yeah, you could say that.

673

With what?

674
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,709
Danielle's mom wants to
help Danielle

675
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:32,000
by trying to get custody
of Elliot.

676
00:33:32,041 --> 00:33:34,583
I tried to tell her
to back off,

677
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:37,291
and then I went
to apologize for Cooper

678
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:39,792
and only made matters worse.

679
00:33:39,834 --> 00:33:43,083
Sam, you okay?
His vessels are so small.
Damn it. I can't connect 'em.

of the arteries apart.

682

I can't get the lumen open.

683
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,041
Sam, do you want me to call
somebody else in to take over?

684
00:33:56,083 --> 00:33:58,542
It is okay to step aside.

685

I know this is not

711
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:31,166
A therapist should be
a facilitator.

712

What my role is--
what I believe my role is--

713

is to help you decide
what you want.

714

Not to impose my views
on you.

715
00:35:40,417 --> 00:35:43,875
When you were here,
I crossed a line.

716
00:35:43,917 --> 00:35:45,083
No.

717
00:35:45,125 --> 00:35:47,041
You made me think.

718
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:49,083
But I was talking
about myself.

719
00:35:49,125 --> 00:35:52,500
I've had some things
happen to me,

720
00:35:52,542 --> 00:35:55,709
but they should never, ever,
impact my patients.

721
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:59,750
I don't know what you said,
but... this is all good.

722
00:35:59,792 --> 00:36:01,959
We're moving forward.

723
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,291
Well, if that's what you want,
if that's what you both want,

724
00:36:05,333 --> 00:36:07,041
then that's good.

725
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:10,417
I'm just afraid that
I haven't given collette

726
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:12,417
the chance to think
what she thinks,

727
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:15,417
to feel what she feels.

728
00:36:15,458 --> 00:36:18,750
So I'm asking you both
to wait a moment,

729
00:36:18,792 --> 00:36:21,125
to step back
and talk about this.

730
00:36:21,166 --> 00:36:22,834
No.

731
00:36:22,875 --> 00:36:25,333
Just--just to think,
just to be sure.

732
00:36:25,375 --> 00:36:29,041
Because there are some things
that you can't take back,

733
00:36:29,083 --> 00:36:31,000
and this
is one of those things.

734
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:39,041
I'm scared.

735
00:36:39,083 --> 00:36:41,417
Everything you said...

736
00:36:41,458 --> 00:36:43,041
That's how I feel.

737
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:45,875
But when you first came in,

738
00:36:45,917 --> 00:36:47,875
you were feeling
other things, too--

739
00:36:47,917 --> 00:36:51,375
joy... hope.

740
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,542
Let's put those things
into words, too,

741
00:36:53,583 --> 00:36:56,917
so you can move forward,
together.

742
00:37:15,625 --> 00:37:17,542
I hate this...

743
00:37:20,125 --> 00:37:22,709
That I couldn't protect you.

744
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:24,834
I know.

745
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:27,792
I know.

746
00:37:27,834 --> 00:37:30,208
But...

747
00:37:33,208 --> 00:37:36,208
What do you want to do?

748
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:46,291
I am a pregnant woman.
I am nine months pregnant.

749
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:49,208
Look in the book, Dell--
hormones out of whack,

750
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:52,041
emotions all over the place,
and so I'm freaked out.

751
00:37:52,083 --> 00:37:54,417
And you, the person who's
supposed to be my support,

752
00:37:54,458 --> 00:37:57,041
question me whether I know
what I'm ready for?

753
00:37:57,083 --> 00:38:00,041
I am ready for this.
This is everything that I want.

754
00:38:00,083 --> 00:38:02,417
The only one that
I'm worried about is you.

755
00:38:02,458 --> 00:38:04,417
You're right.
I-I was out of line

756
00:38:04,458 --> 00:38:06,041
and unprofessional.

757
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:09,208
I'm the one who needs to be
more patient, and I'm sorry.

758
