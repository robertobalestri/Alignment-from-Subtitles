00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:04,041
D-Dying...
In a pool of her own blood.

179
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:07,125
I mean, and her baby
just gone.

180
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:11,041
There are no words

181
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,667
to adequately convey

182
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:14,667
the horror
of what she went through

183
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:16,458
and what I witnessed.

184
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,125
The image of her
like that...

185
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,125
It still haunts my dreams,

186
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,875
and, uh...
And so does the guilt

187
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:26,875
of being powerless
to help her

188
00:08:26,917 --> 00:08:29,125
or help her find Lucas.

189
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:33,291
If that still terrorizes me,
I-I can't even imagine...

190
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,667
How it's affected Violet.

191
00:08:35,709 --> 00:08:39,041
And, uh, I have compassion
for her...

192
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,458
For my friend.

193
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,291
Whew.

194
00:08:49,542 --> 00:08:52,041
So what happened
when you opened the door

195
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,041
and Katie was
on the other side of it?

196
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,500
I already told you.
I was attacked.
Yeah, but what happened?

197
00:08:56,542 --> 00:08:58,500
What did Katie do?
How did you react?

198
00:08:58,542 --> 00:09:00,583
What were you feeling
during the attack?

199
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:03,500
I can't talk about
the attack anymore.
You've discussed it?

200
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:06,041
With whom?
I have worked through
the attack,

201
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,583
and now I want to focus on
getting back to my life.
We have talked about this.

202
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:11,417
I mean, I've told you that.
I--no. Just... no.

203
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:14,125
Violet,
you cannot shrink yourself.

204
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,834
I know that you want to have
control over this situation,

205
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,625
most likely because you didn't
have control over the attack.

206
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:22,250
I get it. But it's not gonna
help you get through this.

207
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:26,000
Now you've been seeing me
for some time now.

208
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,959
And I assume that you...

209
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,959
Came to me
because you want my help.

210
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,625
So let me help you.

211
00:09:32,667 --> 00:09:34,792
Okay?

212
00:09:36,834 --> 00:09:38,333
Okay.

213
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:41,583
So... what happened
when you opened the door?

214
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,750
Katie jabbed a needle
into my arm.

215
00:09:46,792 --> 00:09:49,041
And then?

216
00:09:51,834 --> 00:09:54,041
Sometimes p.T.S.D.

217
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,792
Causes flashbacks
or intense fear,

218
00:09:55,834 --> 00:09:58,667
hypervigilance, numbness
or avoidance.

219
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:02,041
Have you treated
Violet Turner for p.T.S.D.?

220
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,583
Counseled her?

221
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,583
Well, I'm her friend,
her ex-boyfriend,

222
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,583
and... it's a funny story,
actually.

223
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,000
I...

224
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,250
I was almost Lucas' father.

225
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:14,792
Excuse me. How exactly
is that possible?

226
00:10:14,834 --> 00:10:17,041
Well, Violet and I
were dating

227
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,041
when she started sleeping
with Pete.

228
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,834
Uh, which is to say, uh...

229
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:24,625
Not that she's promiscuous.
She's not.

230
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:26,041
It's just that she, um...

231
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,625
Well, it was a confusing time
for all of us, I think.

232
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:30,542
And, um... my point was

233
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:33,041
that none of us knew
who the father was

234
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:35,417
until a few weeks
after Lucas was born,

235
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:38,542
so I naturally became
very attached to him.

236
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:41,041
Dr. Turner didn't know
Dr. Wilder was the father

237
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,333
when she turned the child
over to him?

238
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:46,083
Not definitively, no.

239
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,542
Back to the question. Have you
ever treated Violet Turner?

240
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,542
No. Given our history,

241
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,291
being her therapist
would be a breach of ethics.

242
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,875
So given her behavior,

243
00:10:54,917 --> 00:10:56,875
her inability
to connect with her son

244
00:10:56,917 --> 00:10:58,375
after the attack,

245
00:10:58,417 --> 00:11:00,792
do you believe
that Violet Turner

246
00:11:00,834 --> 00:11:02,709
suffers from p.T.S.D.?

247
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,250
Objection. Dr. Wallace is not
called as an expert witness

248
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:08,250
nor as Dr. Turner's
psychiatrist.

249
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:10,709
You don't
have to answer that.

250
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:17,542
I suspect Violet suffers
from p.T.S.D.

251
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:27,250
Hey. Thank you
so much for coming.

252
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:30,125
Oh, god. I wouldn't have
missed this for the world.

253
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,917
Oh, I'm just so sorry.
I'm so sorry

254
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,917
that you have to
go through all this.

255
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,500
And, uh, I hope
this isn't my fault.

256
00:11:37,542 --> 00:11:41,792
When you were gone and you
couldn't be there for Lucas...

257
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,208
I...

258
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,417
I encouraged Addison
to be there.

259
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,709
Thank you.

260
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,208
Thank you.

261
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,709
We're gonna fight this.

262
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,125
We're gonna fight, and you're
gonna get your son back.

263
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,000
Okay.
Absolutely.

264
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,000
All right?
All right.

265
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,750
We call Dr. Amelia Shepherd
to the stand.

266
00:12:02,792 --> 00:12:05,333
P.t.s.d. Causes identifiable
neural correlates.

267
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:08,041
Uh, and we can see them clearly
in an m.E.G. Scan.

268
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,083
Here we see that Violet has

269
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:13,542
high abnormal activity
in the temporal lobes

270
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,208
as well as atrophy
in the hippocampus.

271
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,834
Both are consistent
with p.T.S.D.

272
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:19,041
Can you interpret
these findings?

273
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,750
There is evidence that p.T.S.D.
Is a physical disease.

274
00:12:21,792 --> 00:12:23,417
Which means?
It's treatable.

275
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:26,041
Talk therapy,
antianxiety drugs?

276
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,750
Both are traditional routes.

277
00:12:27,792 --> 00:12:30,000
Personally, I would treat it
with beta-blockers.

278
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,166
P.t.s.d. Manifests with
a host of physical symptoms--

279
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:35,041
rapid heart rate,
shortness of breath.

280
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:37,041
Take away the physical response
from the memories,

281
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:40,041
and you've taken away
the condition.

282
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:43,041
So what you're saying is,
Dr. Turner could be treated

283
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,041
as easily as prescribing
a heart medication?

284
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:48,041
That's what I'm saying.
This is a physical ailment.

285
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,041
War vets, victims of abuse,

286
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,458
people who have been in
accidents--they all get it.

287
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,208
We're not trying to take
their kids away from them.

288
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,792
Give the woman
back her child.

289
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,041
Pete--

290
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:07,500
okay, you...
Are not welcome here anymore.

291
00:13:07,542 --> 00:13:09,041
Whoa. First, screw you,

292
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,041
and second,
this is not your house.

293
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,291
This is Addison's house.
Come on.
Amelia--

294
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,291
look, look, we have to go
pick up Lucas anyway.

295
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,625
Let's just stay
at your house tonight.
No. Pack and leave.

296
00:13:17,667 --> 00:13:20,834
Pete, let's just--
I was called to testify, I got
on the stand, I told the truth.

297
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,834
You've been out of
medical school for five minutes.
Okay--

298
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,500
you come to my custody hearing,
a custody hearing for my son...
Who do you think--what?

299
00:13:25,542 --> 00:13:28,041
Okay, you guys--
I am a board certified
neurosurgeon.

300
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,500
And you start spouting some
psuedo-scientific crap--

301
00:13:30,542 --> 00:13:33,834
You know what? I'll be
at my house if you need me.
Addie, what are you doing?
I mean, you are letting him--

302
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:36,750
it's his child.

303
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:38,750
Yeah?
Well, the way he's acting,

304
00:13:38,792 --> 00:13:41,333
maybe he's the one
with p.T.S.D.

305
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,583
When you say "abandonment"--

306
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,041
that's what it was.

307
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,875
Violet abandoned our child.

308
00:13:46,917 --> 00:13:49,041
That's a strong word,
"abandonment."

309
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,875
Another strong word is "hate."

310
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:52,875
Have you ever hated anyone,
Dr. Wilder?

311
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:54,542
Not that I know of.

312
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,667
You were married, correct?

313
00:13:56,709 --> 00:13:57,709
Yes.

314
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,709
What happened to your wife?

315
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,667
She died.

316
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:03,583
How did you feel
about her death?

317
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:07,041
Did you ever say
that you hated your wife

318
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:10,125
and you felt nothing
about her death?

319
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:13,750
Yes.

320
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:20,041
I don't care who she's been
to you in the past.

321
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,709
Today Violet is your enemy,

322
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,709
and we're fighting
for Lucas' life.

323
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,125
Now do you want to win this
or not?

324
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:29,500
- Violet Turner's a great mother.
- It doesn't give you pause

325
00:14:29,542 --> 00:14:32,333
that Violet
gave her baby away to Pete?

326
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,333
Violet knew her limits
and asked for help.

327
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,333
She did more for her child
than most mothers do.

328
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,625
She coulda kept her child,
hired a nanny, spent her days

329
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:40,917
locked in her room
with the vapors like my mother,

330
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,750
but she didn't.
Do you think--

331
00:14:42,792 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm not finished. She handed
Lucas over to his father

332
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,000
out of love for her child.

333
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,041
Now she's spending
all her time

334
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:51,041
apologizing for taking care
of herself.

335
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,625
As far as I'm concerned,

336
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:55,000
she doesn't have to apologize
to anyone for anything.

337
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:57,083
She's getting on with her life
the best way she can.

338
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,041
She's ready to spend time
with her son.

339
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,542
I don't see why
we aren't all supporting her.

340
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:05,041
So Violet talks to you about
wanting to be with Lucas,

341
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:08,000
shows you photos of him,
talks about milestones?
Milestones? God, no.

342
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,792
Violet and I are friends 'cause
she isn't that kind of mother.

343
00:15:10,834 --> 00:15:13,750
I hate babies. So does she.

344
00:15:13,792 --> 00:15:17,542
I mean... we don't like
other people's babies.

345
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,041
But she likes Lucas.

346
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:22,792
She does. She loves him.

347
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:33,041
Violet hates babies.
That's a nice one.

348
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,041
Really?

349
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,583
After what you said,

350
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:40,667
you're coming to discuss
my testimony?

351
00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:42,166
She was counting on us.

352
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,166
At least
I tried to be loyal.

353
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,667
I know I messed it up,
but you didn't even try.

354
00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:49,583
So don't you come and try
to push your guilt on to me.

355
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:51,583
I'm not taking any of it.

356
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:54,834
Why don't you stuff it
where the sun don't shine?

357
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,959
Do you think
Addison Montgomery

358
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
is a good influence
in Lucas' life?

359
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,500
I need a verbal answer,
Dr. Bennett.

360
00:16:04,542 --> 00:16:07,625
I-I don't know.
Have you seen her with Lucas?

361
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:08,834
Yes.

362
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:11,500
Have you seen her feeding him
and bathing him,

363
00:16:11,542 --> 00:16:13,625
playing with him?
Yes.

364
00:16:13,667 --> 00:16:15,750
Does she seem comfortable?

365
00:16:15,792 --> 00:16:17,542
Enough.

366
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,542
Dr. Bennett, can you think
of any reasons

367
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,291
why Addison Montgomery

368
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:27,834
might not be
a good influence on Lucas...

369
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:32,041
Or reasons why
Violet Turner would be?

370
00:16:33,917 --> 00:16:35,041
Dr. Bennett,

371
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:39,667
she asks, you respond.

372
00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:41,625
Right.

373
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,792
You know what, your honor?
We're done here.

374
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,875
Sam.

375
00:16:49,917 --> 00:16:52,000
Sam, what was that?

376
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:55,041
They asked me questions,
and I answered.
That was it? That was
all you had to give?

377
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,041
You know
this was important to me.
I couldn't.

378
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,041
You should've gotten up there--
I-I wanted to...

379
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:01,125
Well, why not?
And I-I couldn't.

380
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,542
B-Because of me? Because you--
I'm in love with Addison.

381
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,542
I love her, and at the same
time, I hate her.

382
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,709
Seeing her with Pete
is killing me.

383
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,709
Last night,
I was out on my deck,

384
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,083
and I could hear all three
of them next door.

385
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:15,083
And Lucas was laughing, and if
I had gotten up on the stand

386
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,083
and said
what I wanted to say...

387
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:19,083
I want to tear them apart.

388
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,542
I want to take that baby
away from them.

389
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,041
But it's for
the wrong reasons.

390
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,041
So I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

391
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:28,041
But I-I need to be able
to look myself in the mirror

392
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,041
and know that I'm a good man.

393
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:33,041
I'm trying to be a good man.

394
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,625
So I said nothing...

395
00:17:35,667 --> 00:17:39,333
Because if I had said
what I wanted to say,

396
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:42,333
I wouldn't have been
testifying for you.

397
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:45,041
I would've been testifying
for me.

398
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:47,041
Dr. Turner,

399
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:50,333
if you win, if partial custody
is granted to you,

400
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:54,041
what do you
look forward to with Lucas?

401
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:57,417
What are you
looking forward to?

402
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,333
I...

403
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,583
I can't wait
to watch him sleep again.

404
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:04,875
After he was born, uh,
b-before I gave him to Pete,

405
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,875
I used to watch him sleep,
and he just...

406
00:18:06,917 --> 00:18:08,917
He looked so peaceful.

407
00:18:08,959 --> 00:18:10,709
And, uh...

408
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,375
Well, now he's trying to walk
and form words

409
00:18:13,417 --> 00:18:16,917
and, um... and I want to be
a part of all that.

410
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,667
I don't wanna...

411
00:18:18,709 --> 00:18:21,375
I don't wanna miss
anything else.

412
00:18:21,417 --> 00:18:23,792
Do you want to take
a minute...

413
00:18:23,834 --> 00:18:25,709
Get some water?

414
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,000
No, I'm okay.

415
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,166
So you're glad you had Lucas.

416
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,875
'Cause you did think about
aborting him, didn't you?

417
00:18:32,917 --> 00:18:36,041
Just like you aborted a number
of other babies, right?

418
00:18:42,792 --> 00:18:44,041
Me. That's me.

419
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,750
Here. Me.

420
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,667
What if I lose?

421
00:18:49,709 --> 00:18:51,041
We're not gonna lose.
We.

422
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:53,041
What if I lose?

423
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,041
"We. We."
What if we lose?
What if we lose?

424
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,041
It's not losing anyway,
all right?

425
00:18:57,083 --> 00:19:00,041
Violet is Lucas' mom. It's not
like she's gonna hurt him.

426
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:03,041
It's not like I said she was
gonna drown him in the bathtub.

427
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,834
You know what?
It's past his bedtime.

428
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,917
He should've been asleep,
like, a half-hour ago.

429
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:09,083
I'm gonna put him down, okay?

430
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:12,083
It's just--we don't need her,
this. We don't need this.
Can you, uh,
get the door, please?

431
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:14,083
Yeah.
All right. Ready?
Say good night.

432
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:15,875
Good night.
Say night-night.

433
00:19:15,917 --> 00:19:18,000
Night, big man.
Night-night, daddy.

434
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:26,709
I went to your house first,
but you weren't there.

435
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,875
So I figured,
I mean, Addison's, it--

436
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,041
I mean, I know it's late
and my lawyer would...

437
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:34,750
Be upset if she
knew that I was here, but--
what?

438
00:19:34,792 --> 00:19:37,250
H-How did we get here,
Pete?

439
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,500
I mean, here, in court.

440
00:19:39,542 --> 00:19:42,041
You sued me.
I know that, but isn't...

441
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,709
Isn't there a more civil way
of doing this?

442
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,709
Your lawyer knows all these
personal things about everyone.

443
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,834
So does yours.
Well, that's why I'm asking,
how did we get here?

444
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,917
Violet, you put Lucas
in my arms

445
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,083
and made me solely responsible
for his well-being.

446
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:58,083
I have to do what I think
is right for him.
Really?

447
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:01,291
Because it feels like...

448
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,291
The way--
the way you look at me,

449
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:06,542
it feels like punishment,
like you are punishing me.
That's not my intention.

450
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:09,041
Well, Sam said a thing.

451
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:12,041
He said that he loves Addison,
but that he hates Addison.

452
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,834
So it makes it hard
for him to...

453
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:17,750
Look, clearly, you hate me.

454
00:20:17,792 --> 00:20:22,000
But are--are you
doing all this because...

455
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:27,583
Are you still
in love with me?

456
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,792
Violet.

457
00:20:37,834 --> 00:20:40,583
Leave me alone.
Hey, hey, come on. Come here.

458
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:43,041
Hey, what the hell
was that?
What?

459
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,041
Fellas, keep it together.
That's good advice.

460
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:48,542
No, screw that. Do you have
any idea what you just did?
You don't understand.

461
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,542
That's crap, Cooper.
I have a daughter, okay?

462
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,959
That's crap.
Where is she?

463
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Inside. Hey, maybe we should
give her a minute?

464
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,166
You okay?

465
00:21:02,917 --> 00:21:05,834
You want me to fire Cooper?

466
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,834
'Cause I can.
I'll fire Charlotte.

467
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:10,041
I been looking for a reason
to fire Charlotte.

468
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,041
Say the word,
and I will.

469
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,375
Who knew?

470
00:21:16,417 --> 00:21:20,250
Who knew that everyone thought
I was such a horrible person?

471
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:23,041
What'll happen if I lose?

472
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:26,000
I can't
go through this again.

473
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,709
What would you tell
a patient

474
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,000
if she were
going through this?

475
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,959
I don't know.

476
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,208
Come on. Yeah, you do.

477
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,458
Yeah, you do.

478
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:50,458
I'm still in love with Pete.

479
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,625
Don't tell anyone. Okay?

480
00:21:55,667 --> 00:21:58,417
Okay.

481
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,291
Okay, let's go back.

482
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,041
Let's go back.

483
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:05,041
At what point during the attack
did your mind drift to Lucas?

484
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:08,000
Why is this significant?
Because we've recounted this
numerous times,

485
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:10,000
and at no point
have you mentioned your baby,

486
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,959
not once, and I want
to talk about him.

487
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,542
Okay, so let's go back.

488
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:16,041
You're on the floor--
well, blood was pouring
out of my body

489
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:19,917
and I was ruining the rug.
I don't know.
Stick with me, Violet.

490
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:24,959
Just stay with me.

491
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:29,333
Do you know how much
I begged her not to do it?

492
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:33,000
Do what?

493
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:37,375
To cut him out of me.

494
00:22:44,417 --> 00:22:47,166
Nai, do you mind
if I sit?

495
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
What am I gonna say, no?

496
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:03,041
How did we get here?

497
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:05,041
How did we
let it get this bad?

498
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:14,000
I don't know.

499
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:22,041
You like playing house
with my son, Addison?
Violet--

500
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:24,583
there are two people
who knew about my abortions,

501
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:27,041
and I am sure Naomi
was not the one who told.

502
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:29,041
I--
you want to fight dirty?
Let's fight dirty.

503
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:31,041
But you started it.

504
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:33,792
Remember that
when you're on the stand.

505
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:39,041
Do you believe

506
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:41,750
that Violet Turner
is a fit mother?

507
00:23:41,792 --> 00:23:45,041
Please answer the question.

508
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:46,417
No, I do not believe

509
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,834
that Violet Turner
is a fit mother.

510
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:51,041
She's made no contact
with the baby.

511
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:53,041
I've tried to fill that void.

512
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:55,458
I know I'm not his mother.
I didn't, uh...

513
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,083
It was not my intention to,
but it just sort of happened,

514
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:01,375
and, um...
I-I'm glad that it did.

515
00:24:01,417 --> 00:24:04,458
He's a very special
little boy.

516
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,875
Well, I commend you,
Dr. Montgomery.

517
00:24:06,917 --> 00:24:09,291
Not many women would take on
the responsibility

518
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:11,166
of raising
another woman's child.

519
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:13,041
No further questions.

520
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:15,041
Would you call yourself

521
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:17,041
an honest person,
Dr. Montgomery?

522
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:19,250
Yes, I would.
You were married, right?

523
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:22,041
Yes, I was.
I'm--I'm divorced now.

524
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:25,041
And why did
your marriage dissolve?
Objection.

525
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:27,333
Why is Dr. Montgomery's
marriage relevant?
Well?

526
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:29,333
It goes to her credibility,
your honor.

527
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:32,041
Answer, Dr. Montgomery.

528
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:35,834
I, uh... had an affair,
and my husband left me.

529
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:38,834
And who did you
have an affair with?

530
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:40,834
He was
my husband's best friend.

531
00:24:40,875 --> 00:24:43,834
Didn't you also have an affair
with your patient's husband,

532
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:47,083
a, uh...
Dr. Noah Barnes, I believe--

533
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:49,041
we never slept together.

534
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:51,041
Okay,
so you've been dishonest,

535
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:54,041
broken your vows when it
served you, haven't you?

536
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:56,041
Which begs the question,

537
00:24:56,083 --> 00:24:59,875
how much trust can we put in
your credibility here today?

538
00:24:59,917 --> 00:25:02,667
Objection. Seriously,
this is abusive.
All right, moving on.

539
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,917
Why don't you have children,
Dr. Montgomery?

540
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:10,959
I can't.

541
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,959
Did you ever
want to have children?

542
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,041
Yes, I tried,
but I was not able to.

543
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:18,667
So would you lie on the stand
to keep Lucas,

544
00:25:18,709 --> 00:25:21,875
to protect your
one last chance at motherhood?

545
00:25:21,917 --> 00:25:23,500
Objection.

546
00:25:23,542 --> 00:25:25,041
No, I want to answer.

547
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:28,041
You're right. I'm a cheater
and a husband stealer,

548
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:30,041
and on top of all that,
I'm barren.

549
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:33,041
So good times. I...

550
00:25:33,083 --> 00:25:35,500
I never wanted
any of this to happen.

551
00:25:35,542 --> 00:25:37,917
I never
wanted to hurt Violet.

552
00:25:37,959 --> 00:25:40,166
Yes, she's a mess.
I'm a mess, too.

553
00:25:40,208 --> 00:25:43,709
I... I'm here for Lucas.

554
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,083
He's a baby, so he can't
speak for himself.

555
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:48,083
But I'm pretty sure
if he could,

556
00:25:48,125 --> 00:25:51,083
he'd say that he wanted
to feel loved and safe

557
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:54,750
and have cereal for dinner.

558
00:25:54,792 --> 00:25:57,041
I just want Lucas
to be happy.

559
00:25:57,083 --> 00:25:59,041
So if that means
you tearing me apart

560
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:01,709
and making me look like the most
horrible person on earth,

561
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,625
then please,
go ahead and do it,

562
00:26:03,667 --> 00:26:05,125
because...

563
00:26:05,166 --> 00:26:08,041
Lucas is worth it... to me.

564
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:10,041
So...

565
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:14,625
Next question... Ms. Gibson?

566
00:26:14,667 --> 00:26:17,000
Are you still in love with me?

567
00:26:21,166 --> 00:26:24,834
I'm sorry...

568
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:28,250
Everything that's happening
has hurt you.

569
00:26:28,291 --> 00:26:31,291
But I can't let you hurt Lucas
the way you hurt me.

570
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:34,166
I have to protect him.
You--you didn't answer
the question.

571
00:26:34,208 --> 00:26:36,291
What do you expect from me?
I don't know.

572
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:38,291
I-I mean,
we made a baby together.

573
00:26:38,333 --> 00:26:41,041
I mean, the least we could
offer each other is honesty.

574
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:42,667
Honest? Fine. I'm done.

575
00:26:42,709 --> 00:26:45,041
I have moved on.
I'm over you.

576
00:26:45,083 --> 00:26:48,041
I wish you well. Best of luck
in all your future endeavors.

577
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:49,417
You've ripped my heart out

578
00:26:49,458 --> 00:26:51,792
and you walked away
from our child.

579
00:26:51,834 --> 00:26:55,208
I have moved on.
I don't love you.

580
00:26:57,875 --> 00:27:01,250
You want me to be honest?

581
00:27:01,291 --> 00:27:04,041
Honesty isn't nice.

582
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:17,041
You were fantastic
on the stand today.

583
00:27:17,083 --> 00:27:20,417
If that doesn't win it
for us, I don't know...

584
00:27:20,458 --> 00:27:22,041
Is the baby asleep?

585
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:24,041
What?
Is Lucas asleep?

586
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:26,041
Yeah, he went down fine.

587
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:31,709
How did your lawyers know
about Violet's abortions?

588
00:27:35,083 --> 00:27:37,458
Answer me.

589
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,917
I had to do something
to help us win.

590
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:42,458
I don't even know what to say to you.
 Wh--

591
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,959
Pete, I don't know.
Addison,
why don't you start--

592
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,041
I don't know.
It's like you--you have done

593
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:49,583
some horrible things during
this trial, but I told myself

594
00:27:49,625 --> 00:27:51,959
it's because, you know, you're
worried and you're scared.

595
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,750
But now--now it's like
you've shut down Pete

596
00:27:54,792 --> 00:27:57,041
and become this
cold, hard, mean--
you know what?
Mind your own business.

597
00:27:57,083 --> 00:27:59,041
Mind my own business?
Yeah, stay outta this.

598
00:27:59,083 --> 00:28:01,166
This is my business.
You made it my business

599
00:28:01,208 --> 00:28:03,333
when you put your son
in my arms.

600
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:06,041
If I didn't love that kid,
I'd sit back

601
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:09,041
and I'd watch you and Violet
tear each other to shreds.

602
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:12,000
But I do love him, and that is
who I am concerned about here.
And I'm not?

603
00:28:12,041 --> 00:28:14,542
You better think about
what you're gonna say to him

604
00:28:14,583 --> 00:28:17,542
when he asks you one day, "why
did you do this to my mother?"

605
00:28:17,583 --> 00:28:19,542
And what are you gonna say?

606
00:28:19,583 --> 00:28:22,041
I hope you're gonna have
something good to say, Pete,

607
00:28:22,083 --> 00:28:25,000
or else otherwise, he's gonna--
what, what,
he's gonna hate me?

608
00:28:25,041 --> 00:28:28,792
No, he is gonna be ashamed
of you, like I am right now.

609
00:28:28,834 --> 00:28:30,125
Pete...

610
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,792
Why are we here?

611
00:28:31,834 --> 00:28:34,291
I mean, all we ever wanted
since Lucas was born

612
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:36,291
was for Violet to be
a part of his life.

613
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:39,000
How many times did she walk out
of a room that he was in?

614
00:28:39,041 --> 00:28:41,041
How many times did she walk
around him or by him

615
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:43,208
or pretend
that Lucas didn't exist?

616
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,417
And every time, you and I,
we'd run into a corner

617
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:47,542
and have
a hushed conversation,

618
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:50,041
hoping and praying that she
would just look at him.
Exactly. That's--

619
00:28:50,083 --> 00:28:52,000
okay, but she did.
She looked at him.

620
00:28:52,041 --> 00:28:55,041
You know, Violet did
what we all asked of her,

621
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:58,041
and instead of supporting her
or breathing a sigh of relief,

622
00:28:58,083 --> 00:28:59,750
because, yeah,
it's about time...

623
00:28:59,792 --> 00:29:01,041
We're in court, you know,

624
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:04,041
telling her, "no, Violet, you
can't be a mother to your son."

625
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:06,166
It's a little hypocritical,
don't you think?

626
00:29:06,208 --> 00:29:07,959
Cooper, she's not ready.

627
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,041
Deep down,
I think you know that.

628
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:12,041
Do you believe

629
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:15,000
that Violet Turner
is a fit mother?

630
00:29:22,875 --> 00:29:24,083
Dr. Freedman?

631
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:28,875
Answer the question,
Dr. Freedman.

632
00:29:30,834 --> 00:29:33,333
No, I don't.

633
00:29:35,333 --> 00:29:38,041
Violet...

634
00:29:38,083 --> 00:29:39,458
Violet, I should've...

635
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,458
I should've told you
how I was feeling.

636
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,041
I didn't because I wanted
to be there for you.

637
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:46,458
I was going to be there
for you, and I got up there

638
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,458
and I realized
that this is about Lucas.

639
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,417
But I shoulda talked
to you first. I'm sorry.

640
00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:03,041
All right, I'm gonna give you
five minutes.

641
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:04,750
You've got five minutes

642
00:30:04,792 --> 00:30:07,750
to sulk about what everybody
said about you in there.

643
00:30:07,792 --> 00:30:09,750
You got five minutes
to cry and scream

644
00:30:09,792 --> 00:30:12,625
and to call them every single
bad name in the book.
Nai--

645
00:30:12,667 --> 00:30:14,625
then when those five minutes
are up,

646
00:30:14,667 --> 00:30:17,041
you're gonna walk
back into that courtroom

647
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:19,041
and you're gonna fight
for your son.
I can't. I can't.

648
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:21,542
I'm sorry,
but the clock's ticking.
Damn it, Naomi.

649
00:30:21,583 --> 00:30:24,083
You know, maybe he's
better off without me, okay?

650
00:30:24,125 --> 00:30:26,792
Maybe I am a terrible mother.
Well, that does not mean
that you quit.

651
00:30:26,834 --> 00:30:29,125
Yes, there will be times
when you let your child down.

652
00:30:29,166 --> 00:30:31,125
There will be times
when you do the wrong thing.

653
00:30:31,166 --> 00:30:34,041
There will be times when you
are a horrible mother.

654
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:36,041
But that does not mean
that you quit.

655
00:30:36,083 --> 00:30:38,041
It means
that you fight harder.

656
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:40,041
I mean, that's--
that's what I shoulda done.

657
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:43,041
So go back in there
and fight.

658
00:30:43,083 --> 00:30:45,041
Fight for the both of us.

659
00:30:45,083 --> 00:30:48,041
Stick with me, Violet.

660
00:30:48,083 --> 00:30:51,083
Do you know how much
I begged her not to do it?
Do what?

661
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:54,125
To cut him out of me.

662
00:30:54,166 --> 00:30:56,709
I begged and I begged
and I begged.

663
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:59,083
And when--when I knew
she was gonna do it,

664
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:01,166
I-I told my baby...

665
00:31:01,208 --> 00:31:03,500
I told Lucas

666
00:31:03,542 --> 00:31:07,041
that mommy was very... sorry

667
00:31:07,083 --> 00:31:09,083
for letting this happen.

668
00:31:09,125 --> 00:31:11,500
And, um...

669
00:31:11,542 --> 00:31:13,917
And then I...
And then I let her.

670
00:31:13,959 --> 00:31:15,500
Let her what?

671
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:18,166
I told Katie
how to cut him out of me--

672
00:31:18,208 --> 00:31:21,166
where to cut, how deep
the incision should be,

673
00:31:21,208 --> 00:31:23,333
how to see through the blood.

674
00:31:23,375 --> 00:31:25,041
I helped her.

675
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:27,500
I helped her take my baby
away from me.

676
00:31:27,542 --> 00:31:31,041
Violet... listen to me.

677
00:31:31,083 --> 00:31:33,166
♪♪♪

678
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:36,458
What could've happened
to Lucas

679
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,208
had Katie
made the incision incorrectly?

680
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:41,208
She--she could've cut him.

681
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:45,750
And what could've happened
to Lucas if she cut too deep?

682
00:31:45,792 --> 00:31:47,875
She could've cut him.

683
00:31:47,917 --> 00:31:49,125
That's right.

so did you have any doubts

before the attack?
Every woman has doubts
about becoming a mother.

Yes, I had normal amount
of uncertainty

714
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:05,291
about becoming a mother.
Why didn't you do
a paternity test?

715
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:07,291
Until I understood
what motherhood meant to me,

716
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:09,875
I couldn't consider
the feelings of a partner,

717

the best option.
And after he was born?

Let's get this straight.
Lucas was not born.

719
00:33:14,834 --> 00:33:16,542
He was ripped from my body.

720
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:19,667
And afterwards, I was fighting
for my life and my sanity,

721
