Hey, vi,
you left your door open.
Call 9-1-1.

14
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:59,166
She's hypotensive
with massive blood loss.

15
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:01,250
Respiratory rate is 8.
Elevate her legs.
I'm calling them.

Pete.
Call them.

17
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:06,375
She's still alive, but I can
barely palpate her pulse.

18
00:01:06,417 --> 00:01:09,041
Pete, where is the baby?

19
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:12,000
I don't know.

20
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:13,375
This is Dr. Naomi Bennett.

21
00:01:13,417 --> 00:01:15,667
I-I need an ambulance

00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:29,041
I got an O.R. standing by.
Montgomery's on her way.
I'm here.

26
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:31,458
Set up a central line. We need
blood. What's her blood type?

27
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,834
Does anybody know
her blood type?
C.B.C., chem-7,
cross and type times 4.

28
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:37,083
Set up a rapid infuser.
Where's the baby?

29
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:39,208
We don't know.
There was a placenta

30
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,208
and--and the cord was cut,
but there wasn't...

31
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,291
Okay, I got this, Pete.
I should know her blood type.

32
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:45,291
Pete, I'm taking over,
all right? Stay here.

33
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:48,041
Cooper, a little help.
I-I was there. I was there
and I heard a noise.

34
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:51,041
I was right at her door,
and I left.
Okay, Nai,
let's go. Come on.

35
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:53,041
Can somebody get her
a trauma gown, please?
You gotta use o-neg.

36
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:56,041
Pete, just let me--
let me do my job.
She's lost so much blood.

37
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,458
Okay, just wait here.
No, no, I gotta be
in here with her.

38
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,667
No, Dr. Wilder. Look at me.
We don't have time for this.

39
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:03,667
I don't have time
to convince you

40
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:06,458
to let me do
what I know how to do.

41
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,000
There is no time. Wait here.
Cooper.
Pete.

42
00:02:12,834 --> 00:02:15,041
We have a kitchen!

43
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:17,041
At work,
we have a-a kitchen.

44
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:18,500
It's nice.

45
00:02:18,542 --> 00:02:20,500
At my last office,
I had a, um,

46
00:02:20,542 --> 00:02:22,500
I had a mini fridge
wedged under my desk.

47
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:24,500
That's where I kept
the urine samples.

48
00:02:24,542 --> 00:02:26,333
This is fancy.

49
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,959
What do you think
about Sam and Naomi?

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,333
They seem nice.

51
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:32,333
I mean,
I like 'em 'cause they,

52
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,375
you know, hired me.

53
00:02:34,417 --> 00:02:36,375
Why? What do you think?

54
00:02:36,417 --> 00:02:38,375
They're happy.

55
00:02:38,417 --> 00:02:40,375
They're--
they're happy people.

56
00:02:40,417 --> 00:02:42,959
They're happy people
in love with each other.

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,834
It's creepy.

58
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:47,291
Do you think it's real,
the love?

59
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,542
Oh, it's real.
Oh, my god. Oh, I'm just--
I was--I'm sorry, Sam.

60
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:53,709
I think what she meant to say
was thank you for our jobs.

61
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,709
If he's trying to get you
to work here, say yes.

62
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,041
It's fancy.
We have a kitchen.
No, I'm just--

63
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:01,417
I have my own practice
in Beverly Hills--

64
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:03,792
infectious disease.
I--I'm Violet.
This is, uh--

65
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:06,041
Cooper Freedman. Hi.
Hi. Pete Wilder.

66
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:08,083
This is Pete, the friend
I told you about.

67
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:09,667
Oh, yes. Pete.
Right.

68
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:12,041
Oh, yes. What?
What am I missing?

69
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:15,125
I'm a patient. I'm...
Supposed to be a patient of--

70
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:18,125
oh.
Sam wants me to speak
with Violet about my wife.

71
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:20,250
Oh. Divorced?

72
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:22,542
Dead.
She died four days ago.

73
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,041
Hey.

74
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:25,959
Hey.
I came up with a name.

75
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,125
Oceanside wellness.

76
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,542
That's good, right?

77
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:32,458
Yeah.
What?

78
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,750
What happened?
Um, someone...

79
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:39,667
Took Violet's baby.

80
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:42,166
They cut her
and took her baby.
Katie. It had to be Katie.

81
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,500
Violet's patient?
I'm going in there.

82
00:03:44,542 --> 00:03:46,208
No, no. Come on.
I'm family.

83
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,208
We're all family here,
all right? Addison's got this.

84
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,000
She--she said she wanted to be
with me. She said she loved me.

85
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:54,000
She said...
We should get you
cleaned up.

86
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,208
What?
Blood, man.
You're covered in blood.

87
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,792
All right, come on.
Come on. Right this way.

88
00:03:59,834 --> 00:04:01,166
Daddy?
Yeah.

89
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,917
Someone got hurt?

90
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,000
Uh, yeah, yeah.
Someone got hurt.

91
00:04:08,834 --> 00:04:11,041
Sam says you're great.

92
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:14,208
Well, he doesn't really know me,
but, uh, but I am. I'm great.

93
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,250
Well, he's great, too--Sam.

94
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,250
You're gonna like
working for him.

95
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,333
And, well,
these offices are nice.

96
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,041
They're big.

97
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:25,041
I'm stalling.

98
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:29,041
Therapy is hard
for some people.
It's not hard.
It's just artificial.

99
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,500
Sitting down and telling
your innermost thoughts

100
00:04:31,542 --> 00:04:35,041
to someone you don't know?
Did you tell
all your innermost thoughts

101
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,834
to someone you do know?

102
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,834
Did you do that
with your wife?

103
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,834
Because that's what we're here
to talk about, right?

104
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,834
Look, I'm not here for me.

105
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,834
I'm here because it's easier

106
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,834
than having Sam and Naomi
be all over me

107
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,875
because they can't get
the fact that I'm coping.

108
00:04:48,917 --> 00:04:51,250
My wife died, and it's awful,
and I'm coping.

109
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,166
Do you want to tell me
about her?
No. I...

110
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,792
Her name's Anna.

111
00:04:55,834 --> 00:04:57,166
It was.

112
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,083
She died of an aneurysm
in her sleep.

113
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:02,959
So she didn't have any pain.
There was no suffering.

114
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Look, I...

115
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,458
I respect what you do,

116
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,458
and I get
that Sam and Naomi think

117
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,041
that I'm not showing
the right emotion

118
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:13,083
or I'm in denial
or I'm not talking enough,

119
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,542
but I'm a private person.

120
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:17,667
It's not that I'm not feeling
this, that I don't miss her.

121
00:05:17,709 --> 00:05:19,667
Uh, maybe I'm not
displaying my emotions,

122
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:21,792
but I'm feeling this
in my own way.

123
00:05:21,834 --> 00:05:23,792
I understand that. I-I do.

124
00:05:23,834 --> 00:05:26,333
But, um, I still think,
as a professional,

125
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:29,041
talking about those feelings
will help.

126
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:32,500
I just... don't really
have anything else to say.

127
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:34,041
I... this--

128
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,625
what happened is horrible.

129
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:40,041
But I'll get through it
in time...

130
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:42,500
On my own.

131
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:46,041
You say she had
a mental illness, the attacker?

132
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,625
Yes. Katie. Katie Kent.

133
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:50,500
Is someone out
looking for the baby?
We put out an--

134
00:05:50,542 --> 00:05:53,417
it's been almost two hours.
We put out an Amber alert.
Everyone is looking.

135
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:56,333
Have you checked her apartment?
She's cleared out.
Everyone is looking, sir.

136
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:59,208
You were at the crime scene?
Yes, I told the other officer.
I found her.

137
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,542
Maybe if you'd put
something on TV--
sir, what is your relationship
to the victim?

138
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,542
Violet! Her name is Violet!
Pete--

139
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,542
the guy is standing her
asking me questions,

140
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:09,041
and the woman is out--
Just let him do his job.

141
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,333
Sir, your relationship
to... Violet.
He's her boyfriend.

142
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:14,583
I was seeing a patient upstairs
and I-I heard.

143
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,125
I'm sorry.
I should've called.
And who are you?

144
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,542
I'm the baby's father.

145
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:22,041
Uh, well, kind--
kind of the baby's father.

146
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,959
Maybe the father. So is he.
We're both--
we're the baby's father.

147
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,375
It's a long story.

148
00:06:26,417 --> 00:06:29,458
It's... just wear a condom.
Tell your friends.

149
00:06:50,834 --> 00:06:52,625
There's a waiting room...

150
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:55,250
With chairs.

151
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,375
I had to call
Violet's parents.

152
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:04,041
Those people are...
Okay, yes, they are worried.

153
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,000
But they're on vacation
in London.

154
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,500
They didn't even contemplate
getting on an airplane to L.A.

155
00:07:08,542 --> 00:07:10,500
They didn't even
think about it.

156
00:07:10,542 --> 00:07:13,041
She was raised by wolves,
by intellectual, snooty wolves.

157
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:16,041
I'm basically--i mean,
I'm her immediate family.

158
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,417
You're not gonna check it?

159
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:23,417
Nobody wants me treating
their kid in this state.

160
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:26,667
The answering service
will refer whoever's on call.

161
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:32,458
You know, I was right there.
I was at the door.

162
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,500
And you called,
and--and i-i--
I called because I got fired.

163
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:38,500
No--
I called because you're
my boyfriend, and I needed you.

164
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:40,875
No, I'm not blaming you.
I'm not saying--

165
00:07:40,917 --> 00:07:43,875
it's not your fault. It's
my fault. I coulda stopped it.
You didn't know.

166
00:07:43,917 --> 00:07:46,041
I coulda walked--
I could've saved her.
You don't know that either.

167
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,041
If she had
had the baby yesterday

168
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,250
like she was supposed to...

169
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:53,291
She doesn't do anything
like she's supposed to.
Yeah, she's a real bitch
that way.

170
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:54,917
Just making a point.

171
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,458
Which is?

172
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,750
She's not to blame.
I'm not to blame.

173
00:07:58,792 --> 00:08:00,792
You're not to blame.

174
00:08:00,834 --> 00:08:02,583
The only person
who deserves blame

175
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:05,041
is that woman who attacked her
and took her baby.

176
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,250
You're not a superhero, Coop.

177
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:10,542
No, I'm her family.

178
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:16,417
Just take my hand
and breathe.

179
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,834
All right, everyone.

180
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:27,041
We treat her like
a multiple stab wound victim--

181
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,041
control the bleeding,
repair any organ damage,

182
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:31,083
and we get out
as fast as we can.

183
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:34,959
Nai, scrub in. I need
all the hands I can get.

184
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,041
Nai.

185
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,041
I was going over to her house

186
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:40,625
to tell her
that I was leaving the practice.

187
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:42,458
We've worked together

188
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,542
every single day
for the past nine years--

189
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,041
she's gonna be okay.

190
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,125
Are you sure?

191
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,041
No.

192
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,417
I.V. Tech
to room 321.

193
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,959
I.v. Tech to room 321.

194
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,333
Hey, did you hear anything?

195
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,000
No.
No.

196
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,041
Violet wanted
to have Katie committed.

197
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:16,083
She knew.
And I made fun of her.
We made fun of her.

198
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:19,709
She knew something was wrong,
and I talked her out of it.
We talked her out of it.

199
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,417
I should've--
I should've just let--

200
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,417
we. We. We.
It is we, not you.

201
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,834
We are in love with Violet.

202
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:28,041
We are the possible fathers
of that baby.

203
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:30,041
We are worried.
We are scared.

204
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,041
We ignored her concerns
about Katie.

205
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:35,542
We, not you, you smug,
arrogant bastard.
But I'm the one she chose.

206
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:39,208
Come on.

207
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,542
All right. All right.
I'm okay.

208
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:49,000
How does something
like this happen?

209
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,709
I don't know.

210
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:59,500
I don't know.
I don't know.

211
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,583
- How's she doing?
- Pressure's 60 over 40.

212
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,041
She's losing blood faster than
I can transfuse it in.

213
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,375
Oh, god. What did
she use, a hatchet?

214
00:10:29,417 --> 00:10:31,875
There. Got it.

215
00:10:31,917 --> 00:10:35,000
Addison, her pressure's
not coming up.

216
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,542
Damn it. She is bleeding
from everywhere.

217
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,792
Nai, we're gonna have to
extend the incision

218
00:10:39,834 --> 00:10:41,125
to make it vertical.

219
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:44,041
We gotta see what else
is bleeding and tie it off.

220
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,667
- Scalpel.
- Addison.

221
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:48,000
What?
They need answers.
Pete, Sheldon--

222
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:51,041
- I-I need to be able to tell them something.
- Addison!

223
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:54,667
It's not the liver edge. It's
one of the mesenteric arteries.

224
00:10:54,709 --> 00:10:56,917
All right. Clamp.

225
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,041
We're all here, Violet,
pulling for you.

226
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,625
Just thought
you should know.
She can't hear you, Dell.

227
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,417
It's gonna be okay.
Everything's going to be okay.

228
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,417
Dell, stop talking!
I can't hear myself think.

229
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:14,834
Addison...
He's just trying to help.

230
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,750
You just--you keep talking
to her, Dell. Go ahead.

231
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,709
Um...

232
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,709
I-I got Betsey back,

233
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,291
which was maybe
the hardest thing I've done.

234
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:30,041
Before Betsey,
I didn't really have a family.

235
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,834
You guys...

236
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:35,875
You're my family.

237
00:11:35,917 --> 00:11:37,875
You're my family, Violet.

238
00:11:37,917 --> 00:11:40,875
So... I'm sitting here
selfishly telling you...

239
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:42,792
Not to die.

240
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,000
Okay?

241
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:53,125
So I just got off the phone
with Leo brinkman.

242
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:55,750
He has to push back
his start date?

243
00:11:55,792 --> 00:11:57,458
No, he got sued.

244
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,542
- Yeah, apparently he likes to touch his patients' feet...
- Ooh!

245
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,417
- For sexual reasons.
- Great.

246
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,792
Ooh. Shoulda gone
into podiatry.
That's not funny.

247
00:12:04,834 --> 00:12:08,041
It's a little funny.
But it's awful.
We're still short one.

248
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,166
D-Does anybody know
a good dermatologist?

249
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,041
Well,
I actually was thinking,

250
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,041
maybe we could give
his slot to Pete.

251
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,208
I thought he was
infectious disease.

252
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,583
It's even better.
He's got a great practice.

253
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,583
I like it.
It's something we don't have,

254
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:23,041
- and he does critical care-- that's two for one.
- I know.

255
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,041
But we can't--i mean,
he can't work here

256
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:28,041
- '- cause he's a patient, so we can't hire him.
- Wait, wait.

257
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,792
He goes to you once because I
make him, now he's off-limits?

258
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:34,041
Actually, yes. I had a session
with him, so he's a patient.
Even if he says he's fine?

259
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,375
He says he's fine.
I don't believe him.

260
00:12:36,417 --> 00:12:38,500
You don't believe him,

261
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:41,417
otherwise you wouldn't have
sent him to me.
Obviously he's not fine.
His wife just died.

262
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,834
- Is he a good doctor?
- He's a great doctor.

263
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,041
Look, let's say Coop keels over
from a heart attack...
Ooh.

264
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,709
And I give him c.P.R.

265
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,083
Does that mean we have to fire
him because he's "my patient"?

266
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,875
Um, Sam, could you not put
things like that out there.

267
00:12:52,917 --> 00:12:55,041
The universe has
a perverse sense of humor.
We cannot hire him.

268
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,041
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Is this an issue

269
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,083
because he's a patient
or there's a problem?

270
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:02,041
Wait, you know Pete.
Yeah, I-I-I do.

271
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,250
But if he can't suit up,
we can't use him.

272
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:07,917
That's the issue.
Okay, we need a new partner--
a good doctor,

273
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:09,917
and someone that we
get along with personally.

274
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:12,083
Pete is both.
Look, there is
something there, okay?

275
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,083
I mean, he sat with me,
he said all the right things,

276
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:18,041
he knew all the right answers,
but there's something there.

277
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:20,458
And until I know what it is,

278
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,458
until he's ready to face
what it is,

279
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,291
trust me, you don't want him
working here.

280
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,458
I hate this.

281
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,458
I hate it. I should--
I should be doing something.

282
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,458
I should be out looking
for Katie or the baby or--

283
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,500
that's not your job.

284
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,000
What if she dies?

285
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,917
I had a patient...

286
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:59,417
An old woman, a southern woman,
southern baptist.

287
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:02,291
Strongest woman I ever met.

288
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:05,583
And they were having a party
for her 90th birthday,

289
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,583
only she was having
chest pains,

290
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,583
so they took her
to the hospital.

291
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:12,583
A minivan t-boned her car
on the way there.

292
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:17,333
She lost her husband,
two sons, a grandchild.

293
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,333
Her heart was fine.

294
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:22,375
It was, uh, indigestion.

295
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:31,542
Is there a point or are you
just spouting random crap?

296
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,542
She came to me
because everyone was worried

297
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:36,750
that she was so devastated,
she wouldn't be able to go on.

298
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:39,750
So I-I asked her.
I asked her how she was coping.

299
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:43,750
And she said to me,
"son, god will provide."

300
00:14:43,792 --> 00:14:45,750
That's it?

301
00:14:45,792 --> 00:14:47,959
She loses everything.
"God will provide"?

302
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,041
My point was...
We should have a little faith.

303
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,917
Do you?

304
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,041
Have faith?

305
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,917
No.

306
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,834
But I'm pretending I do.

307
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,417
Vascular clamp.

308
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,041
Okay, bovie here.

309
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,041
The bleeding's not slowing.

310
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:17,041
I know. Every time
I sew up one bleeder,

311
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,041
another one appears.

312
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,041
She's lost so much blood.
I don't--

313
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:24,041
I don't think she can take
much more.

314
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,208
Take out her uterus.

315
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,041
A hysterectomy?

316
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,041
To save her life.
No.

317
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,250
I can embolize
the uterine arteries,

318
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:35,041
block the blood supply
and stop the bleeding.
She could die while you're
prepping her for the procedure.

319
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:37,709
Do the hysterectomy.
What if the baby's
gone for good, Nai?

320
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,709
Violet wakes up,
her baby's gone,

321
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,041
and she can't have
another child?
We'll find the baby.

322
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:44,041
Okay, life isn't always
that simple and easy, Nai.

323
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:47,333
Babies don't always get found.

324
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:50,041
There isn't always
a happy ending.
Yeah, things don't always
have a happy ending,

325
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,709
but she would be alive,
Addison. She would be alive.
I'm embolizing.

326
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,208
Whoa. What about Violet?

327
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,041
What about
what she would want?

328
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,041
Hold these.

329
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,250
Apply pressure to the uterus.
Don't move.

330
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:04,166
Dell, keep talking to her.

331
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,000
- I need a decision.
- You save Violet.

332
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:11,250
You do whatever you have to do,
but you save Violet.

333
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:14,875
Is--is it really
and either/or?
If you save her uterus,
she could still have kids.

334
00:16:14,917 --> 00:16:17,041
Yes.
But she could die.

335
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,583
Yes.
If you take out her uterus--

336
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:21,375
Violet lives, which is
the goal here. Violet lives.

337
00:16:21,417 --> 00:16:25,041
Stop talking over me.
I'm trying to understand this.

338
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,375
This is big. This--
I need a decision. Pete?

339
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:29,250
Save Violet.
Sheldon?

340
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:32,041
No, she chose me. He doesn't
have--he doesn't have a--

341
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:35,834
I was going to agree
with you. Save Violet.

342
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:38,417
Cooper?

343
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,417
Wait, no. What are you
asking him for?

344
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:44,041
Because he's... her Cooper.
To Violet, he's her Cooper.

345
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:47,917
He's her best friend.
Cooper?

346
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:50,709
Yeah, o--you know,
we don't have time for this?

347
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:54,375
Cooper!
What would Violet want?

348
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:57,166
She'd want you to try
to save her uterus.

349
00:16:57,208 --> 00:17:00,417
She'd want you to at least
give her a shot

350
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,083
at whatever she wants.

351
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,500
No, no.
No, no, you guys love her.
I know her.

352
00:17:04,542 --> 00:17:07,959
I know every food she likes.
I know every thought

353
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,959
she's ever had about a guy,
including the two of you.

354
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,542
I know... Violet.

355
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,500
This is what she'd want.

356
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,041
I'm gonna embolize.

357
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,125
Addison...

358
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,542
Damn it.
You know what, Cooper?

359
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,041
Hey, Pete--
I am not on call!

360
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,834
I'm gonna take
someone's head off right now!

361
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:32,041
I'm glad you came back.

362
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,125
According to Sam,
I didn't have a choice.

363
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,583
You know about the job?
I have my own practice.

364
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,625
But in light
of what's happened,

365
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:42,166
yeah, working with friends...
Seems good--

366
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,166
seemed good--
but not to you.

367
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:46,417
Well, no, no, I think working
with friends could be great,

368
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:49,208
however--
you can't figure me out.

369
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,834
My emotions don't fit
into one of your boxes,

370
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,208
so you think there must be
something wrong with me.

371
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,583
I don't have any boxes.
I'm just here to help you.

372
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,041
And what we're doing now--

373
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,917
talking about the job
instead of your wife's death--

374
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:03,667
well, that's just another way

375
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:06,500
of you avoiding dealing
with something profound.
I told you about my wife.

376
00:18:06,542 --> 00:18:10,792
Yes, you told me what she died
of and that it wasn't painful.
And I told you
what I'm feeling--

377
00:18:10,834 --> 00:18:13,542
actually, you--you told me
that you were feeling,

378
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:16,041
not what you were feeling.

379
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:19,041
You're holding things in,
and when you do that,

380
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,125
what happens is,
eventually it festers

381
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,875
and it explodes.

382
00:18:23,917 --> 00:18:25,959
It's like one of
your infectious diseases.

383
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:29,125
Sometimes you leave it alone.
You let the body heal itself.

384
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:32,083
But your job is to figure out
when to take action

385
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,083
in order to prevent
further damage.

386
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,083
Well, that's my job, too.

387
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:39,083
And I look at you, and, uh,
I can't see leaving this alone.

388
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:42,083
I think we need to attack this
for your own sake--

389
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:45,375
not for me or Sam, for you.
Are you married?
Have you ever been married?

390
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:48,375
I don't think
that's the issue.
But it is. I--I'm sure
you went to school,

391
00:18:48,417 --> 00:18:50,000
and you learned all about

392
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:52,041
the brain and medications,
people's feelings.

393
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,542
But if you haven't been married,
if you haven't had

394
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,792
a relationship like that,
you're not qualified

395
00:18:56,834 --> 00:19:00,375
to sit there and tell me
anything about it.
I don't--i don't want
to tell you anything.

396
00:19:00,417 --> 00:19:02,041
I just want to listen.
And judge.

397
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:05,041
I'm not judging you.
But you are.
You're judging my grief.

398
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:07,333
And you know what?

399
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:11,000
I don't think
you're qualified.

400
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,709
Cooper Freedman.
You paged me five times.

401
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,917
Am I the only pediatrician
in Los Angeles?

402
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:20,500
I am not on call.

403
00:19:20,542 --> 00:19:23,333
You're the only pediatrician
she wants.

404
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:28,125
Call security now.

405
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,083
I heard about Violet
on the news.

406
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,041
They say she's alive.

407
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:38,041
Is she alive?

408
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,125
Oh, I had my baby.

409
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:43,041
He's beautiful, isn't he?

410
00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:50,709
When Violet's better,

411
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,250
I want her to see my baby.

412
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,166
She's gonna be so surprised.

413
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:58,542
Everyone thought it was a girl,
but I had a boy.

414
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:02,125
And, um, is he healthy?
What did the doctor say?

415
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:04,875
The doctor
who delivered him?

416
00:20:04,917 --> 00:20:08,000
Um... he's fine.
He's perfect.

417
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,375
I just ask 'cause he--
he looks a little pale.

418
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:14,166
Um, do you mind
if I check him out?
Um...

419
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,125
Pete.

420
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:21,125
Hey, Pete.
Um, Katie had her baby.

421
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,959
Isn't that great? Um...

422
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,625
Does he look slightly pale
to you?

423
00:20:26,667 --> 00:20:29,792
Yes, he does.
Could indicate hemolysis.

424
00:20:29,834 --> 00:20:31,792
You should check him out.
Yeah.

425
00:20:31,834 --> 00:20:33,583
What does that mean,
hemolysis?

426
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,583
It's a breakdown
of the red blood cells.

427
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,583
It happens in newborns.

428
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:40,583
They used to die from it,
but it's very treatable now.

429
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:45,041
Well, he--he cries if
anyone else touches him, so--

430
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:48,041
well, Katie, Cooper just wants
to help. Look, I know you.

431
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:51,041
I know how much you wanted
to have this baby,

432
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:55,000
how--how much you want it
to be healthy.

433
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:57,041
Katie, look at me.

434
00:20:57,083 --> 00:21:00,959
You need to let Cooper
make sure. It's gonna be fine.

435
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,041
Just--just have
a little faith.

436
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,041
Okay.

437
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,542
You... be careful.
Hold his head.

438
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:21,625
Hi there, little guy.
Let's check you out.

439
00:21:21,667 --> 00:21:23,250
Katie.

440
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:26,291
I got him. I got him.

441
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,542
I got him. Okay.
No, that's my baby.

442
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,959
No, that's my baby.
You're taking my baby!
No.

443
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,041
No!
It's not your baby!

444
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,875
You're stealing my baby!
That's my baby!

445
00:21:35,917 --> 00:21:38,166
They're stealing my baby!
No. No!

446
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,875
No.
I gotta stop Addison.

447
00:21:40,917 --> 00:21:43,875
Pete. Pete.

448
00:21:43,917 --> 00:21:45,041
Pete.

449
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:47,500
Give me my baby, please.

450
00:21:47,542 --> 00:21:50,959
Please give me my baby.
Please.

451
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:56,000
Inserting the catheter
into the uterine artery.

452
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:57,959
Addison, we have the baby.

453
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,750
I was wrong.
Stop the embolization.

454
00:22:00,792 --> 00:22:03,458
Just take out her uterus. Do
whatever you can to save her.
You have the baby?

455
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,041
Katie showed up in the waiting
room. Pete's got him.
Thank god.

456
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:09,041
Addison, stop.
It's too late, Coop.
I've already started.

457
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:11,709
Is it working?
It's the baby.
We need you, Coop.

458
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,625
There was bruising on
the abdomen. I checked his crit.

459
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,375
He's markedly anemic,
going into shock.

460
00:22:16,417 --> 00:22:19,041
I think his spleen may be torn
from being cut out.
Did you get an ultrasound?

461
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:21,792
- There's free fluid in the abdomen.
- He needs surgery now.

462
00:22:21,834 --> 00:22:24,041
I'm gonna go look.
You--you can't
just leave Violet.

463
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:27,375
I'm almost done. You've done
this before. You can close.
I've done this before
in medical school.

464
00:22:27,417 --> 00:22:29,500
I'll be right back, Nai.
Cooper, can get the baby,
Addison.

465
00:22:29,542 --> 00:22:32,041
Cooper is not
a neonatal surgeon. I am.

466
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:34,166
I have a peds surgeon
standing by.

467
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:37,083
Not as good as I am.
Clear an O.R.
Addison, stop.

468
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:41,750
Let another doctor do this.
I can save them both, Nai.
I can save them both.

469
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:54,125
Coop?

470
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:56,583
If I had answered
one of those pages...

471
00:22:56,625 --> 00:23:00,709
Oh, my god.
How much time did I waste?

472
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,000
How long was she waiting?

473
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:09,041
Hey, how'd it go?

474
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:11,333
Ooh. Not good?

475
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:14,166
You know, you don't have to
listen to Violet.
Well, maybe you should
see her some more.

476
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:16,792
No, Sam. I'm done.
That woman...

477
00:23:16,834 --> 00:23:18,208
I'm sorry.

478
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,417
I don't want to trash
your new colleague.

479
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:22,041
It's okay. I'm sorry.

480
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:24,041
What are you doing, spying?

481
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:26,583
Uh, yeah.
Oh, my...

482
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:30,041
I forgot
how big Maya got.

483
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:33,041
Oh, she's starting
kindergarten this fall.

484
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:34,458
I'm a lucky guy.

485
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,000
Yeah.

486
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:38,000
No. I mean it.

487
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,792
I'm... a lucky guy.

488
00:23:40,834 --> 00:23:43,166
It's luck that Naomi
was my lab partner,

489
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:46,166
luck that she went out with me
for that first time,

490
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:49,208
luck that she said yes
when I proposed.

491
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,667
I'm just lucky
that Maya's healthy

492
00:23:51,709 --> 00:23:54,041
and that we're happy

493
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:57,250
and that we have
this life...

494
00:23:59,542 --> 00:24:01,041
When you're--

495
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:03,041
yeah.

496
00:24:06,792 --> 00:24:11,208
I'm a lucky guy.
It's just luck.

497
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,959
She's the love of your life.

498
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,333
That's not luck.

499
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:19,333
That's... something else.

500
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:22,583
Yeah, but you know
what I'm trying to say.

501
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:25,917
I'm gonna be fine, Sam.
I am.

502
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,959
Hey, Pete.

503
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,291
You're standing there so long.
You think she wouldn't see you?

504
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:35,291
She wants you to come in. She
wants us to take turns reading.
All right.

505
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:37,875
Do you have a patient?
No, no, I'm good.

506
00:24:37,917 --> 00:24:40,000
Okay.
Uh, do you want to wait?

507
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:42,458
No, we'll talk later.
I'm fine.
All right.

508
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,709
Hey, Maya.

509
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,083
What's up with you?

510
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,917
Okay, one more suture.

511
00:24:58,083 --> 00:25:00,041
Pulse ox is dropping.
Check her probe.

512
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:01,959
The probe's fine.

513
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,542
But she's tachy
at 130. 140.

514
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:07,041
What's going on?
Is she--is she bleeding?
I don't know.

515
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:08,750
She's in v-fib.

516
00:25:08,792 --> 00:25:11,750
Crash cart.
Paddles charged to 200.

517
00:25:11,792 --> 00:25:14,291
Epi and lido. Let's go.
Charge.

518
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:16,917
Clear.

519
00:25:16,959 --> 00:25:20,041
Anything?
No pulse.
She's still in fib.

520
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:22,041
What the hell
is going on?

521
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:23,500
I don't know.

522
00:25:23,542 --> 00:25:27,125
Unresponsive... v-fib...
Bleeding...

523
00:25:27,166 --> 00:25:30,959
Electrolytes...

524
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,125
Turn her on her side.

525
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:36,041
Give me a 60cc syringe
and a spinal needle.

526
00:25:55,875 --> 00:25:57,583
Got it.

527
00:25:57,625 --> 00:26:00,000
Turn her on her back.
Paddles. 360.

528
00:26:00,041 --> 00:26:02,041
Clear.

529
00:26:05,834 --> 00:26:07,458
She's got a rhythm.

530
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,041
And a pulse.

531
00:26:09,083 --> 00:26:12,709
Pulse ox is coming up.
86. 90. 92.

532
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,709
I did it.

533
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:17,625
I did it.

534
00:26:17,667 --> 00:26:20,625
I did it.

535
00:26:20,667 --> 00:26:22,709
Dell, get Addison.

536
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:26,083
Get Addison now.

537
00:26:30,959 --> 00:26:32,625
So what have we got?

538
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:34,041
Grade 4 splenic laceration.

539
00:26:34,083 --> 00:26:36,041
I'm trying to preserve
the spleen.

540
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:38,041
Vascular clamp.

541
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:40,041
And the argon.

542
00:26:40,083 --> 00:26:42,542
Right there.

543
00:26:42,583 --> 00:26:44,625
Naomi says you need
to come back, now.

544
00:26:44,667 --> 00:26:48,417
Now. Violet is bleeding
from her nose and mouth.

545
00:26:48,458 --> 00:26:50,417
It won't stop.
She's not clotting?
Damn.

546
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:53,041
Naomi said now.
I hear you, Dell.

547
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:55,125
I can finish.

548
00:26:55,166 --> 00:26:56,291
Addison.

549
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:59,291
Okay, let me just clamp this.
Got it.

550
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:01,375
Cauterize
any remaining bleeders, gently,

551
00:27:01,417 --> 00:27:04,291
but wait for me to come back
to set the vicryl mesh.

552
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:08,166
Do not kill this baby
while I am gone.

553
00:27:08,208 --> 00:27:09,375
Addison...

554
00:27:09,417 --> 00:27:11,000
Not now.

555
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:12,375
What's happening?

556
00:27:12,417 --> 00:27:14,792
Not now.

557
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:17,041
I know. I know.

558
00:27:17,083 --> 00:27:19,375
I should...
Try to have a little faith.

559
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,083
What's her fibrinogen level?

560
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:30,041
It's less than 100.

561
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:32,875
She's not responding
to platelets, f.F.P.

562
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:35,583
- Prepare antithrombin.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

563
00:27:35,625 --> 00:27:38,375
She's not clotting, and you want
to give her an anticoagulant?
Addison--

564
00:27:38,417 --> 00:27:40,000
with all the blood loss,

565
00:27:40,041 --> 00:27:41,917
her coagulation system
is working overtime.

566
00:27:41,959 --> 00:27:43,291
Hopefully
with the anticoagulant,

567
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:45,291
it will stop the cascade,
and her own clotting

568
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:47,792
will start up again.
Or it will kill her.

569
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:50,041
It's her only shot.

570
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:52,917
Prepare the antithrombin.
I have to get back to the baby.

571
00:27:52,959 --> 00:27:56,041
You can administer
the a.T.3.
Addison, you better
be right about this.

572
00:27:56,083 --> 00:27:58,458
If she dies--
do it, Nai.

573
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,125
We had a fight...

574
00:28:17,166 --> 00:28:19,166
The night before she died.

575
00:28:19,208 --> 00:28:22,166
Well, we had a fight
almost every night,

576
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:27,041
but the night before she died
was our worst fight.

577
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:29,166
She said things...

578
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:35,333
We said things
that you can't take back.

579
00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:37,583
I woke up the next morning.

580
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:40,041
The alarm went off.
I--her alarm went off.

581
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:42,166
I was still pissed.

582
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:44,834
I turned it off...

583
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:50,250
And she was just laying there
ignoring me.

584
00:28:50,291 --> 00:28:52,250
And it pissed me off.

585
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:55,250
I went to the bathroom.
I brushed my teeth.

586
00:28:55,291 --> 00:28:58,625
I was trying to get her
to talk to me,

587
00:28:58,667 --> 00:29:01,667
and... she was
just laying there.

588
00:29:01,709 --> 00:29:06,917
So I called her a bitch.

589
00:29:06,959 --> 00:29:08,917
I called her a bitch,

590
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:14,000
and still,
she just lay there, silent.

591
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:17,250
So I ripped the covers off...

592
00:29:17,291 --> 00:29:20,250
I ripped the covers off
to make her get out of bed

593
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:22,291
and talk to me.

594
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:25,041
She wouldn't talk to me...

595
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:26,750
Because she was dead.

596
00:29:26,792 --> 00:29:30,125
Five minutes,
I argued with my wife,

597
00:29:30,166 --> 00:29:33,625
and she was laying there,
dead...

598
00:29:33,667 --> 00:29:37,208
And...

599
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,250
I didn't know it.

600
00:29:43,458 --> 00:29:46,875
Well, you--you just said
the most important thing, Pete.

601
00:29:46,917 --> 00:29:48,875
You didn't know.

602
00:29:48,917 --> 00:29:51,041
Your anger, it--
it didn't kill your wife.

603
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:53,709
It didn't change anything.

604
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,458
People fight.

605
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,917
I hated my wife.

606
00:30:00,291 --> 00:30:02,500
See? That's the thing.

607
00:30:05,083 --> 00:30:08,875
I hated her.

608
00:30:08,917 --> 00:30:11,875
And I don't know
what that says about me.

609
00:30:11,917 --> 00:30:14,875
I don't know what that says
about what kind of man I am,

610
00:30:14,917 --> 00:30:18,041
what kind of husband I am.

611
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:20,083
Was.

612
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:22,083
But I hated my wife.

613
00:30:22,125 --> 00:30:24,083
So if you want to know why

614
00:30:24,125 --> 00:30:27,083
I didn't want to come
and talk to you about it...

615
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:30,166
It's because my wife is dead,

616
00:30:30,208 --> 00:30:34,000
and all I can think is...

617
00:30:36,959 --> 00:30:38,959

Charlotte had a peds surgeon
right there.

It's Violet's baby.

I'm good at.

672
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:15,792
I am good at surgery.

771
00:40:09,834 --> 00:40:11,792

changing specialties.
Oh.

772
00:40:11,834 --> 00:40:13,166

773
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:15,875
different ways
for the body to heal itself.

774
00:40:15,917 --> 00:40:19,166
So now that we're...
Just colleagues,

775
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:21,166
can I still ask you
how you are?

776
00:40:21,208 --> 00:40:23,166
Uh, better, I think.

777
00:40:23,208 --> 00:40:25,000
I don't know.

778
00:40:25,041 --> 00:40:28,166
You know, you asked me
what kind of a man you are.

779
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:32,041
Do you want to know
what I think?

780

that married the wrong person.

Maybe she married
the wrong person.

for all that--love, marriage.
