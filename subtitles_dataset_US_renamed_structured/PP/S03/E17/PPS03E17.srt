I had a dream last night
about peaches.

35
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,542
Yeah, big,
succulent southern peaches

36
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:31,750
that went rotten and were all
filled with maggots.

37
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:33,917

Drew's report on Afghanistan.
I told him I'd proof it.

41
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:49,041
Junior high

I didn't care so much.

43
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,500
I was too interested

Well, really just Eddie.
Is Eddie here?

45
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:59,959
No, he went home

uh, could just give me

a couple of minutes alone
with Kayla?
What is it?

54
00:02:17,792 --> 00:02:19,750
Relax, honey.
Let's give 'em their space.

55
00:02:19,792 --> 00:02:22,667
It's just, you know, i'm
so worried about our babies.

56
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:25,041
It's okay.
They can stay.

57
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:26,709
Okay, uh... Kayla,

58
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,709
I had a look at your
repeat scans this morning.

59
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,333
And, uh, the blood clot's not
resolving. It's gotten worse.

60
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:35,709
So what do we do?
Angie, listen.

61
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,041
I'm sorry.
The problem is that
the multiple pregnancies

62
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:41,500
are putting too much pressure
on your veins.

63
00:02:41,542 --> 00:02:44,375
So even with the heparin, you're
continuing to form new clots.

64
00:02:44,417 --> 00:02:46,625
So what happens?
What do you do?

65
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,625
The pregnancy,
or the--the three fetuses,

66
00:02:48,667 --> 00:02:50,959
are just too much
for your body to handle.

67
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,041
So I need to
alleviate the pressure

68
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,750
as soon as possible.

69
00:02:54,792 --> 00:02:56,750
The safest way to do that

70
00:02:56,792 --> 00:02:58,750
would be to reduce
the pregnancy to one.

71
00:02:58,792 --> 00:03:00,750
So you're--
you're saying

72
00:03:00,792 --> 00:03:03,041
you want to kill
two of my babies?

73
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:05,583
If she wasn't a surrogate,
if these were her babies,

74
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:08,625
would you be giving
the same advice?
Yes.

75
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:11,959
They're 20 weeks. A few more,
and they'll be viable.
Kayla doesn't have
a few more weeks.

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
If we wait, she could die.

77
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:26,667
Watching YouTube again?

78
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:28,542
Actually, fife was just
bringing us up to date

79
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,542
on his
a.L.S. Antibiotic trial.

80
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:32,750
These preliminary
results are astounding.

81
00:03:32,792 --> 00:03:35,542
I say we get the human trials up
and running, full steam ahead.
Outstanding.

82
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:38,583
I'll start to put together
a larger subject group.
Wait. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

83
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:41,000
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

84
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:43,000
The safety trials
and the dosing studies are good,

85
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:45,083
but we still need
to get approval

86
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,375
before starting
phase III trials.
That could take months.

87
00:03:47,417 --> 00:03:49,667
There are patients out there
who need this now.

88
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:52,041
This is too important
to wait.
I seem to recall being asked
to be a moral compass here,

89
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,583
a check on the slippery slope
of science.

90
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,583
We're going downslope
too fast.
Tell you what,
I'll take you to dinner,

91
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:00,917
lay out my protocol, the steps
I'd take. I'll win you over.

92
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,834
Actually,
I have dinner plans.

93
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:06,041
I would gladly sacrifice
our date in the name of science.
Now you can't say no.

94
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:07,750
It's settled.

95
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,500
Oh.

96
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:13,500
Damn it.

97
00:04:13,542 --> 00:04:16,458
I'll get it.
I'll get it.

98
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,709
Okay, I'm just gonna
clean this off

99
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,709
so I can get
a good look at it.

100
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,250
It shouldn't hurt.

101
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,458
Thank you so much
for squeezing us in.

102
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,834
Our pediatrician back home never
let anyone just squeeze in.

103
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,291
Well, you're in luck.
You're not gonna need stitches.

104
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,750
Just a few of these bandages
and some antibiotic ointment

105
00:04:34,792 --> 00:04:36,750
will take good care of that.

106
00:04:36,792 --> 00:04:38,959
You won't even have a scar.

107
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,500
Oh. You okay?

108
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:43,542
I am.

109
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,500
But Eli doesn't believe you.

110
00:04:45,542 --> 00:04:47,709
Eli?

111
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,792
Eli is, uh, Maggie's friend.

112
00:04:49,834 --> 00:04:51,583
She's got
a great imagination.

113
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,041
Okay.
Well, not to worry, Eli.

114
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:57,000
Uh, Maggie will be
just fine. I promise.

115
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:01,917
He believes you.
He's just sad.

116
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:04,542
He thinks it was his fault.
Oh, why is that?

117
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:07,125
Eli kept saying that we should
make some new friends here...
Mm-hmm.

118
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,500
That he's tired
of just eating lunch with me.

119
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:11,041
He kept bugging me,

120
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:14,041
so I went over to these
two girls in my gym class,

121
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,583
and I introduced him.

122
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,875
But they were very rude.

123
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:20,041
You introduced Eli?

124
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:24,959
It's always the smart kids
who get picked on, you know?

125
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,417
Hey, you got a minute?

126
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,041
Uh, sure.

127
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,542
Uh, I wouldn't bother you,
but with Violet being gone--

128
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,834
you need a psych consult.
Yeah, I get it.

129
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,375
Um, 11-year-old girl

130
00:05:35,417 --> 00:05:37,917
came in with an abrasion
on her forehead,

131
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:40,917
and then she had me talk
to her imaginary friend.

132
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:43,542
Seems a little old
for that.
Maybe. Maybe not.

133
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:47,041
You know, studies have shown
that children

134
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,709
with imaginary friends
excel academically.
At 11?

135
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,709
The girl just moved here.
She's scared, shy.

136
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,041
I'm worried that she's using
the imaginary friend

137
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,041
to ostracize herself.

138
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:59,041
Maybe she could use some help
figuring out how to fit in.

139
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:02,125
Sure. Sure. I have
a cancellation at, uh, 2:00.

140
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,792
Okay.

141
00:06:03,834 --> 00:06:06,583
You know, this thing
with Charlotte, I, uh...

142
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,750
I don't want it to be
uncomfortable between us.

143
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:12,041
I mean, if there's a problem,
we should talk about it.

144
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:15,417
Sheldon, I know Charlotte,
and she's, um...

145
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,750
Forget it.
No, no, no.
No, no. What? What?

146
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:20,041
No, i--
no, no, no. What?
No, no. Come on. What?

147
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,583
Guy-to-guy, man-to-man?

148
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:26,041
She's using you, man.
She's using you to get to me.

149
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,625
And I hate watching her
yank your chain.

150
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:32,709
We're having no problems
in the chain yanking department.

151
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,792
Did it ever occur to you
that maybe she likes me?

152
00:06:35,834 --> 00:06:37,083
No.

153
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:42,500
I hate my life.
Join the club.

154
00:06:42,542 --> 00:06:45,500
I'm about to terminate
two of three triplets

155
00:06:45,542 --> 00:06:48,041
at 20 weeks.

156
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:51,041
Oh, Addie. I'm sorry.
Is there nothing you can do?

157
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:55,041
Nothing I can do.

158
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,041
So...

159
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,625
Tell me why
you hate your life.

160
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:02,917
Well, my current lover
wants me to go to dinner

161
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:05,834
with the man who wants to be
my future lover.

162
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,834
I am a whore.
William's making you
go to dinner with fife?

163
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,417
Well...

164
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:13,417
It's not exactly
walking the streets, Nai.

165
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:14,875
The--the two of them

166
00:07:14,917 --> 00:07:17,041
are ganging up on me
on this drug protocol.

167
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:20,041
Only with fife, it doesn't feel
like a drug protocol dinner.

168
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,709
It feels, uh... dirty.

169
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,875
You know, good dirty.
But i--

170
00:07:25,917 --> 00:07:27,667
William is amazing.

171
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:29,959
Why can't I just be happy
with what I have?

172
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,917
A woman this morning
mistook me for Lucas' mother.

173
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:36,083
Oh.
Nai, I don't want to be
a mother.

174
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:39,083
Yes, you do.
No, I don't want
to be a mother,

175
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,667
and I'm certainly not gonna
fall in love with Pete's kid.
Yes, you are.

176
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:44,792
He's in love with Violet.

177
00:07:44,834 --> 00:07:47,125
Yeah, well, Violet--for many
reasons--is not available,

178
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,375
and you are,
and you like him.

179
00:07:49,417 --> 00:07:51,250
I do... a lot.

180
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:54,291
So then is there any reason why
you and Pete can't be together

181
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,917
and be happy and maybe be
a little family?

182
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:02,041
What?

183
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,542
Oh.

184
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,542
Is that the new girlfriend?

185
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:08,125
Yep. That's her.
He likes her.

186
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:10,333
Yep.
He likes her.

187
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:13,583
- I'm happy he's happy.
- Here they come.

188
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:20,041
Hey, Sam.
Addison. Vanessa, this is
Dr. Naomi Bennett, my ex-wife.

189
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,291
Hi. Pleasure.
Hi. Nice to meet you.

190
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:25,125
Checking up on Sam?
 Actually, I'm here to see you.

191
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:28,792
About Kayla Lindy. I was asked
for a second opinion.

192
00:08:28,834 --> 00:08:32,291
Kayla called you?
No. Uh, Angie and Simon did.

193
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,625
They think you're wrong.

194
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,208
Kayla, I know
what we're asking.

195
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,250
But we're asking.

196
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:47,041
She says it's safe.
And she says it isn't.

197
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,959
They've waited
so long for these babies.

198
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,792
And we could use the money,
with the kids' college--

199
00:08:52,834 --> 00:08:56,834
baby, I don't care
about the money.
Kayla, I know what you want,
what you all want,

200
00:08:56,875 --> 00:09:00,041
but you cannot
risk your life for this.
But these babies,

201
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,625
they're alive,
and we're so close.

202
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,417
They're not our babies.

203
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:07,041
Look, all due respect,
I can't lose my wife.

204
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,375
We agreed to do this,

205
00:09:08,417 --> 00:09:10,417
but we have a family of our own
to think about here.

206
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:13,417
All right. Let me reassure you,
we would get the best surgeon,

207
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:16,500
and I think this is an outcome
that will be good for everyone.

208
00:09:16,542 --> 00:09:18,792
I understand
what you're all weighing,

209
00:09:18,834 --> 00:09:21,291
but my concern is for Kayla,
and my unequivocal opinion

210
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:24,208
is that this is not
the right course.

211
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,250
I just finished my meeting
with Maggie,

212
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,875
and I think you're right
to be concerned.

213
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:35,250
She's ostracizing herself?
The problem's
bigger than that,

214
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,250
and it's not
a social problem.

215
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,792
I'm afraid
she's schizophrenic.

216
00:09:38,834 --> 00:09:41,417
She's 11
with an imaginary friend.

217
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,875
That's ridiculous.
It's not that she has
a friend.

218
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,875
It's that she thinks
he's real.

219
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:47,917
I mean, an 11 year old
knows the difference

220
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:49,959
between what's real
and what isn't real.

221
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,959
And this girl, I mean, Eli is
more real to her than you or me.

222
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,750
And she's isolating.
I'm seeing signs of paranoia.

223
00:09:55,792 --> 00:09:58,750
She told me that Eli
didn't trust you.
Don't you think
if she was schizophrenic,

224
00:09:58,792 --> 00:10:01,750
her parents would've seen
more signs?
Well, it's hard
for anyone to see it.

225
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:03,750
And she may be
just at the beginning,

226
00:10:03,792 --> 00:10:06,041
which is why we need
to address this fast.

227
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:09,041
I'm gonna prescribe
antipsychotics.
Whoa. Her brain
is still developing.

228
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:12,041
We have a window here.
She's going to hit puberty.

229
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:15,041
The odds are that this is
gonna be exponentially worse.

230
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,875
But when we start
these antipsychotics early,

231
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:18,875
about 20% of these kids
are able to function

232
00:10:18,917 --> 00:10:20,959
and have a fairly normal life.

233
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Without it,
she doesn't have a chance.
She had a normal life.
She moved to a new town.

234
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,000
Now you're gonna put her
on a medication

235
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,250
that's gonna alter her brain
forever. It's too fast.

236
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:32,041
Maggie doesn't have a choice.
Eli is talking to her.

237
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:35,125
You came to me for help.
So let me help her.

238
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:42,250
Dr. Montgomery... I know
what you must think of me.

239
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,041
But I can't have children.

240
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,500
I wanted to.

241
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:48,375
I went through years
of vitamins and supplements,

242
00:10:48,417 --> 00:10:51,250
I.v.f.,
miscarriage after miscarriage.

243
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:54,458
People who can't
have children...

244
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,959
There are other options.

245
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,750
This is my other option.

246
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:02,000
Those babies she's carrying...

247
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,750
I've already named them.

248
00:11:03,792 --> 00:11:06,375
I've already bonded with them,
all of them.

249
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:09,375
And I know that you look at me
with judgmental eyes

250
00:11:09,417 --> 00:11:13,166
when I push Kayla
to keep going.

251
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,959
But she's my last chance.

252
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,208
I understand how you feel.
I do.

253
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,500
But I can't support this
because it's what I want

254
00:11:20,542 --> 00:11:22,041
or it's what you want.

255
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,417
I have to do
what is right for Kayla.

256
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,458
Schizophrenia?

257
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,166
No.
Maggie's a good kid.

258
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:37,375
She makes good grades.
She loves to read.

259
00:11:37,417 --> 00:11:40,333
I mean, tell 'em about the types
of things that she paints.

260
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:43,333
Uh, the colors, the swirls--
it's beautiful.

261
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:46,041
This is not a condemnation
of your daughter.

262
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,041
She has
a physiological disorder.

263
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,041
She invented a friend
to talk to.

264
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:53,458
She has trouble getting along
with other kids sometimes.

265
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,458
That doesn't make her crazy.

266
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,166
It makes her different.

267
00:11:57,208 --> 00:12:00,333
It makes her smart.
It's a coping mechanism.

268
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:04,500
Isn't that
what you guys call it?
Yes, if she were doing this,
but she's not.

269
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:06,458
Eli is not her creation.

270
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,500
What do you think?

271
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:11,041
I think your daughter
is struggling with something,

272
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:13,041
and that's why I went
to Dr. Wallace.

273
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:16,041
And he's the expert.
I know this isn't
what you want to hear.

274
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,667
But this is not about a social
adjustment after a move.

275
00:12:18,709 --> 00:12:21,166
Your daughter
needs to be treated,

276
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,250
because what you think of now
as her quirks

277
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:26,375
could very rapidly
become destructive.
No. They don't know
what they're talking about.

278
00:12:26,417 --> 00:12:29,166
Joe, please--
no. You want
to call my daughter crazy

279
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,375
and lock her up somewhere?

280
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,417
No. I don't buy it.
Let's go.

281
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:37,625
Mr. Roberts, please--
thank you for your time.

282
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm sorry.

283
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,250
You looking for something?

284
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:05,250
Sorry.

285
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:08,041
It's an impressive collection
you have here.

286
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,041
Thanks. Is there something
you wanted?

287
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,041
You got me thinking
this morning,

288
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,333
at the discussion
of the a.L.S. Trials.

289
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,333
I've read about
alternative treatments

290
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,959
being used to slow the rate
of muscular deterioration.

291
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,750
Valine, leucine, isoleucine.

292
00:13:20,792 --> 00:13:23,291
Good. You are up
on the literature.
The results are inconclusive.

293
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,583
Would you be interested
in studying it further

294
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:28,083
as an adjunct to fife's work?

295
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,750
One group gets his protocol,
one control group, of course,

296
00:13:30,792 --> 00:13:33,041
and a third group
gets amino acids.

297
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:36,417
This... came to you
this morning?

298
00:13:39,542 --> 00:13:42,166
Looks like
I loosened it up for you.

299
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,208
Think about it, Dr. Wilder.

300
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,208
I will think about it.

301
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,000
You want to shake on it?
I want you
to hold out your hand.

302
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,041
Why is that?
You couldn't hold the mug
this morning,

303
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,750
you couldn't open the jar now,

304
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:57,041
and you're here
asking for my help.

305
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,041
How long have you been sick?

306
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:03,834
I was diagnosed
eight years ago.

307
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:07,583
It was in remission
till last spring.

308
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,500
I'm sorry.

309
00:14:11,542 --> 00:14:12,959
Does Naomi know?

310
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,959
No. I don't intend to let
whatever it is we have

311
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:17,542
be colored by pity.

312
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:20,875
I'm enjoying it.
I think I'm entitled.
And what about her?

313
00:14:20,917 --> 00:14:23,417
I'd ask that you respect
my wishes. You're a doctor.

314
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:26,375
You should understand,
it's up to the patient

315
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:30,333
to decide when and how
to disclose things like this.
I'm not your doctor.

316
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,375
No, but you work
by certain standards

317
00:14:32,417 --> 00:14:34,375
or Naomi wouldn't have
hired you.

318
00:14:34,417 --> 00:14:36,417
Think about the study, Pete.

319
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,000
I can use
all the help I can get.

320
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,166
Forget everything
that's happened

321
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:49,041
or hasn't happened
between us.

322
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:52,500
What I'm about to say to you
is strictly professional

323
00:14:52,542 --> 00:14:54,291
as a physician
and your business partner.

324
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,375
Okay.

325
00:14:55,417 --> 00:14:58,041
Your girlfriend sucks.

326
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:01,458
Is that your professional
and medical opinion?

327
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,041
She's interfering
with my patient,

328
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,917
contradicting
my medical advice

329
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,917
and putting Kayla's life
at risk.
Vanessa was asked
for a second opinion.

330
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:10,041
She's a very good doctor.
Not as good as I am.

331
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:13,625
What? You want me to pretend
that I'm not amazing?

332
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:16,166
Because we both know that I am.
Look, just ask her to back off.

333
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,875
Well, I'm afraid
I can't do that.
Why not?

334
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,917
Because I'm doing
Kayla's surgery.

335
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,667
Pushing through
to the inferior vena cava.

336

00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:58,041
to place yourself
in a maternal role,

508
00:23:58,083 --> 00:24:01,625
which could be raising feelings
of rejection for you.

509
00:24:01,667 --> 00:24:04,291
As well, you likely project Pete
into the role of your father,

510
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:06,291
Sam into the role
of a forbidden connection,

511
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:08,291
which confuses your feelings
for either man.

512
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:10,041
It becomes hard to see past

513
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:12,041
the deep-rooted
psychosexual implications

514
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:14,750
of what you're going through.
What?

515
00:24:14,792 --> 00:24:18,041
You have mommy issues.
What do I do?

516
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:21,041
Well, since I know you're not
gonna come to my office

517
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:23,500
and since I also now know
that I don't like

518
00:24:23,542 --> 00:24:25,500
being trapped between floors
with tall redheads...

519
00:24:25,542 --> 00:24:28,041
I'd say, um...
What?

520
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:30,041
You see the problem.
That's half the battle.

521
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:32,041
It's up to you to choose...

522
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:34,041
To make the right choices,
to attempt to be happy,

523
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:36,041
to be loved, to be whole...

524
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:38,458
Without drama
and without hurting anyone.

525
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,709
Yeah, but how do I do that?
Addison, I'm telling you...

526
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:46,667
It's time
to grow the hell up. Okay?

527
00:24:46,709 --> 00:24:47,709
Okay.

528
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,792
Okay.

529
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:58,333
What happened to your eye?

530
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,625
Cyndy, hey.
Uh, come in.

531
00:25:03,667 --> 00:25:05,625
Have a seat.

532
00:25:05,667 --> 00:25:07,625
Please.
I'm glad you came back.

533
00:25:07,667 --> 00:25:10,166
Uh...

534
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:12,625
I'm sorry if yesterday,

535
00:25:12,667 --> 00:25:16,333
you felt, um... pushed.

536
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:19,500
No. I just, um...

537
00:25:19,542 --> 00:25:22,208
I'm sorry. Your--your lip.
Are you--are you okay?

538
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,792
I had a basketball game.
It's a competitive league.

539
00:25:24,834 --> 00:25:26,041
Oh.

540
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:28,458
Did you bring Maggie in?

541
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,041
No. I...
I shouldn't even be here.

542
00:25:31,083 --> 00:25:34,166
Joe doesn't know
that I came.

543
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,166
I used to think he was right.

544
00:25:36,208 --> 00:25:38,542
You know, she's just different
than the other kids.

545
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:39,792
Mm-hmm.

546
00:25:39,834 --> 00:25:42,542
But over the past year,
it's gotten worse.

547
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:44,583
Not just since the move.

548
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:47,667
Even before.

549
00:25:47,709 --> 00:25:51,041
I came home from...
Work once,

550
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:53,166
and I found her...

551
00:25:53,208 --> 00:25:54,625
Sitting on my bed,

552
00:25:54,667 --> 00:25:57,041
just...
Staring at the window.

553
00:25:57,083 --> 00:25:59,083
So I went and I made dinner

554
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:03,667
and I did some laundry,
and...

555
00:26:03,709 --> 00:26:08,667
When I came back
two hours later...

556
00:26:08,709 --> 00:26:11,500
She hadn't moved an inch.

557
00:26:11,542 --> 00:26:13,500
Maggie is, um,

558
00:26:13,542 --> 00:26:15,500
she's slipping away from me.

559
00:26:15,542 --> 00:26:18,583
And Joe refuses to see it.

560
00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:20,792
But I'm there every day.

561
00:26:20,834 --> 00:26:22,166
Mm-hmm.

562
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:26,667
And I'm afraid
that Dr. Wallace may be right.

563
00:26:29,709 --> 00:26:32,041
And I don't know
what to do.

564
00:26:34,792 --> 00:26:37,709
You have a look
on your face.

565
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,542
Addison.

566
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:42,250
We had... no, it wasn't
even really a fight.

567
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:44,250
I don't know what it was.

568
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:46,250
Pete, you know
what I'm gonna say.

569
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:48,333
Just give her
the benefit of the doubt.

570
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:51,125
What? I'm biased.
She's my best friend.

571
00:26:51,166 --> 00:26:54,250
Good morning.
Hey, I thought you were out of
the office with meetings today.

572
00:26:54,291 --> 00:26:56,625
Well, I wanted to see you,
hear about last night.

573
00:26:56,667 --> 00:26:58,625
Make sure you didn't
hold a grudge

574
00:26:58,667 --> 00:27:01,583
for me sticking you
with fife.
Oh.

575
00:27:01,625 --> 00:27:05,041
He behaved himself, I hope.
Let's just say that he was,
um, persistent.

576
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:07,000
Well, good. Good.

577
00:27:07,041 --> 00:27:09,542
I'll see you later.
Okay.

578
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:11,917
Dr. Wilder.

579
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:17,583
You like him.

580
00:27:17,625 --> 00:27:20,792
William? Yeah.
Yeah, we're dating.

581
00:27:20,834 --> 00:27:23,583
How well do you know him?

582
00:27:23,625 --> 00:27:27,083
Well enough. Why?

583
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:29,583
Oh, no reason.
I was just wondering.

584
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,959
Hey.

585
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,709
Hey.

586
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:40,375
Look...

587
00:27:40,417 --> 00:27:42,166
About last night...

588
00:27:44,792 --> 00:27:47,834
Did you talk to Pete yet?
Not yet, no. I--

589
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:50,041
Addie. I need to...

590
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:52,291
Uh... what?

591
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:55,583
Uh, n--uh, Sam and I were
just discussing a case.

592
00:27:55,625 --> 00:27:57,166
Okay.

593
00:27:57,208 --> 00:28:00,291
Addie, I-I want to
talk to you about some, uh,

594
00:28:00,333 --> 00:28:02,542
william/fife stuff, so...

595
00:28:02,583 --> 00:28:04,041
Sure.

596
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:05,500
Addison...

597
00:28:05,542 --> 00:28:08,333
It's about Kayla.

598
00:28:09,834 --> 00:28:11,333
She--she was talking,

599
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:14,041
then she--she just, uh,
started gasping for air.

600
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:16,375
Looks like a small clot
moved into her lung.
I thought you said

601
00:28:16,417 --> 00:28:18,667
you were able to block
the clots from moving.
I was.

602
00:28:18,709 --> 00:28:21,417
This means she's forming
other clots above the umbrella.

603
00:28:21,458 --> 00:28:24,000
Is she gonna be okay?
I'm gonna remove the stress
on her system now.

604
00:28:24,041 --> 00:28:27,041
Prep an O.R. I have to reduce
the pregnancy load.

605
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:31,041
You didn't answer my question.
Is she gonna be okay?
I'm gonna do
everything I can.

606
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:33,875
Tell me more about Eli.

607
00:28:33,917 --> 00:28:36,375
What kind of things
do you two do together?

608
00:28:36,417 --> 00:28:37,834
Lots of stuff.

609
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:40,125
Sometimes Eli wants to play
on the computer

610
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:42,542
and sometimes we go for hikes.
I don't like this.

611
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:45,667
We should be in there
with her.
Just let him talk to her.

612
00:28:45,709 --> 00:28:48,667
Do you go with other friends?
 He's gonna get her confused,

613
00:28:48,709 --> 00:28:51,083
make her say
what he wants us to hear.
No, no.
No one has an agenda.

614
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:53,625
We're just trying
to help your daughter.
Well, that sounds like fun.

615
00:28:53,667 --> 00:28:56,041
Most of the time.

616
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:58,083
What about the other times?

617
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:02,000
I don't know.

618
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:04,500
Is it stuff
you don't like to do?

619
00:29:06,542 --> 00:29:08,458
Who gets to decide
what you do?

620
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,875
Eli.

621
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:13,500
I try not to listen,
but...

622
00:29:13,542 --> 00:29:15,792
He doesn't like it
when I ignore him.

623
00:29:15,834 --> 00:29:18,542
What things does Eli say?

624
00:29:22,792 --> 00:29:25,041
Is he talking to you now?

625
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:26,709
He's angry.

626
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:29,709
He doesn't want me to tell you
about the bad stuff.

627
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:32,542
Maggie, I know this is hard.

628
00:29:32,583 --> 00:29:36,333
But you can tell me.
I won't let him hurt you.

629
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:42,709
Eli didn't like me
spending time with munchie.

630
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,500
Who's munchie?

631
00:29:44,542 --> 00:29:46,625
My cat.

632
00:29:46,667 --> 00:29:49,500
Eli was jealous.

633
00:29:49,542 --> 00:29:52,083
He wanted munchie
to go away.

634
00:29:56,041 --> 00:29:59,041
He told me that munchie wanted
to go into the lake.

635
00:29:59,083 --> 00:30:02,041
So I took him to the one
behind our house.

636
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:05,709
And then he told me
to just hold him there,

637
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,500
underwater.

638
00:30:07,542 --> 00:30:12,375
And he fought,
and he scratched...

639
00:30:12,417 --> 00:30:16,000
But I did
what Eli told me...

640
00:30:17,709 --> 00:30:19,208
Until...

641
00:30:22,333 --> 00:30:24,291
He stopped moving.

642
00:30:24,333 --> 00:30:27,625
Oh, my god.
I thought it ran away.
She's upset.

643
00:30:27,667 --> 00:30:30,583
He is upsetting her.
I want this stopped now!

644
00:30:30,625 --> 00:30:32,583
Joe, this isn't gonna stop,
not unless we help her.

645
00:30:32,625 --> 00:30:36,792
I am not locking up my daughter.
I want this stopped!

646
00:30:52,667 --> 00:30:55,834
I wanted to help them.
I believed I was right.

647
00:30:55,875 --> 00:30:58,166
So please spare me
the condescending

648
00:30:58,208 --> 00:31:01,041
"we all make bad calls" speech.
I've heard it before.
That's not
what I was gonna say.

649
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:02,542
I was gonna say
that you screwed up.

650
00:31:02,583 --> 00:31:05,375
You screwed up royally, and now
I have to clean up your mess.

651
00:31:05,417 --> 00:31:08,041
So you can scrub in with me
if you want,

652
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:11,166
but in my O.R., you will shut up
and do as your told.
Okay, that felt personal.

653
00:31:11,208 --> 00:31:14,792
It wasn't.
Are you really mad at me
or Sam?

654
00:31:14,834 --> 00:31:16,834
Maybe before I was
really mad at Sam.

655
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,625
But now that
my patient might die

656
00:31:19,667 --> 00:31:21,041
because of your bad call,

657
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:23,792
I'm really mad at you.

658
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:31,875
And how are you
on this fine day, Dr. Wilder?

659
00:31:31,917 --> 00:31:33,917
Let me ask you a question.

660
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:36,041
Before yesterday, before...

661
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:38,083
William gave you
the green light,

662
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:41,041
were you gonna proceed
more cautiously?
This is not me
being reckless.

663
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:43,375
The man who signs our paychecks
is comfortable

664
00:31:43,417 --> 00:31:45,417
there are no issues here.

665
00:31:47,709 --> 00:31:50,250
If you knew that William
had his own agenda

666
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:52,500
that had nothing to do
with yours

667
00:31:52,542 --> 00:31:54,500
and that's why he has you
moving fast,

668
00:31:54,542 --> 00:31:57,291
would that change anything?
What agenda?

669
00:31:57,333 --> 00:32:00,542
Just do it right, okay?

670
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:03,000
What agenda?

671
00:32:05,041 --> 00:32:09,000
He needs the treatment
for himself.

672
00:32:11,083 --> 00:32:12,000
Hmm.

673
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:16,208
Does Naomi know?

674
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:19,875
No.
Why are you telling me this?

675
00:32:19,917 --> 00:32:21,834
Because this should be
done right.

676
00:32:21,875 --> 00:32:23,041
Whatever your agenda is,

677
00:32:23,083 --> 00:32:26,083
I'm counting on you
to do the right thing.

678
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:32,041
You're angry.

I am not scared.

681
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:39,750
Seeing this happen
to a child you love is scary,

682
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:42,750
and knowing what someone
you love is capable of is scary.

683
00:32:42,792 --> 00:32:44,166
What's scary is you.

684
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:47,041
You want to lock up
a little girl,

685
00:32:47,083 --> 00:32:50,083
take her away from us
a-and make her different.

686
00:32:50,125 --> 00:32:54,041
No one is talking about
taking her away.
Yeah, that's what
you say now.

687
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:56,458
And then you put drugs in her
and you lock her up

688
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,458
and you don't let us
see her again.

689
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,125
And I won't allow that.
No, I won't!
Joe--

690
00:33:01,166 --> 00:33:02,458
no!

691
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,500
Who did they take away
from you, Joe?

692
00:33:06,625 --> 00:33:08,959
Joe?

693
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:14,041
My sister.

694
00:33:14,083 --> 00:33:17,041
But I... I thought
your sister died.

695
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:20,166
Joe, what happened
to your sister?

696
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:24,000
She started, uh,
hearing voices.

697
00:33:24,041 --> 00:33:26,834
God was talking to her.

698
00:33:26,875 --> 00:33:29,041
My parents took her
to the doctors.

699
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:31,583
And... they took her away.

700
00:33:31,625 --> 00:33:34,542
They locked her up
and they called her crazy,

701
00:33:34,583 --> 00:33:36,333
and she killed herself.

702
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:40,333
Oh, honey.

703
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:42,417
Why didn't you tell me?

704
00:33:42,458 --> 00:33:44,417
Because it's my fault
that Maggie's sick.

705
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:48,041
It's in my family.
It's in my blood.

706
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:50,375
And if they'd
just let her be,

707
00:33:50,417 --> 00:33:52,041
it would've been fine.

708
00:33:53,792 --> 00:33:56,041
I'm sorry for what happened.

709
00:33:56,083 --> 00:33:58,125
But treatment has evolved.

710
00:33:58,166 --> 00:34:00,959
They don't just lock up
people with this disease

711
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,125
and throw away the key.

712
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:04,417
We can find medications
and work therapeutically,

713
00:34:04,458 --> 00:34:06,417
and you'll be right there
with her

714
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:09,041
- every step of the way.
- You can't ignore it.

715
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:11,041
You can't pretend
it's not happening.

716
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:13,375
If you accept it,
it can get better.

717
00:34:13,417 --> 00:34:15,917
She can get better.

720

She's throwing another clot,
a big one.

721
00:34:28,834 --> 00:34:31,041
All right.
Raise the oxygen to 100.

722
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:32,917
We need to get her
off the table, into I.C.U.

723
00:34:32,959 --> 00:34:34,709
I've lost her pulse.
She's in fib. Crash cart.

724
00:34:38,959 --> 00:34:41,917
Uh, I wanted to talk to you
about the drug protocol.

725
00:34:41,959 --> 00:34:44,041
I was just thinking
about that, actually.

726
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:48,625
I was, um, I was just sitting
here thinking about Maya.

727
00:34:48,667 --> 00:34:50,625
And I was thinking about
what you said,

728
00:34:50,667 --> 00:34:53,041
about how horrible
this disease is

729
00:34:53,083 --> 00:34:57,041
and how could I
let someone suffer.

730
00:34:57,083 --> 00:35:00,583
And if that were somebody
that I loved...

731
00:35:00,625 --> 00:35:03,917
I looked over your protocol
top to bottom,

732
00:35:03,959 --> 00:35:06,041
and it looks good.

733
00:35:06,083 --> 00:35:09,333
So if you and William
are okay with it,

734
00:35:09,375 --> 00:35:11,000
I'm in.

735
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:16,041
I thought you'd be
appreciative.

736
00:35:16,083 --> 00:35:17,834
I am, uh, but, uh,

737
00:35:17,875 --> 00:35:19,917
I also considered
your argument.

738
00:35:19,959 --> 00:35:22,041
And while I appreciate
the green light,

739
00:35:22,083 --> 00:35:25,041
I-I don't know that what
William and I want is right,

740
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:28,041

The right way.

741

749
00:36:11,834 --> 00:36:13,959

Eddie, uh...

757

The clot went into her lung,
and her heart stopped.

758
00:36:56,083 --> 00:37:00,041
It took us five minutes
to get it started beating again.

759
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:02,417
But her brain
was without oxygen.

760
