97
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,750

99
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,542

you don't see this?

100
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:31,291
I mean, you are enabling her.
Are we gonna have
that fight again?

101
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:34,041
You should've been happy
that we broke up.

102
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,041
You should've been helping me
dump her stuff out.

103
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,500
Instead... you're letting her
get between us.
She's not between us.

104
00:04:38,542 --> 00:04:40,250

107
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,291

Oh, thanks a lot, big sister.
Thank you, doctor.

112
00:05:04,417 --> 00:05:06,917
You're welcome, sir.

113
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:09,709
We have leukemia.
We're not stupid.
Fair enough.

114
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,750
Well, your mom and dad are up
in the birthing suite,

115
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:15,083
and they said they'd be down
in a minute.

116
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,667
How long do you think
till they start our chemo?

117
00:05:17,709 --> 00:05:19,959
Well, uh, we have to
check the cord blood

118
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,291
and count the cells--
hey. Can I talk to you
for a second?

119
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:28,000
Yeah. All right.
I will be right back.

120
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,583
So--
Hello, Dr. Montgomery.

121
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,917
Do you need a consult or...

122
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:38,583
No? It's a little
shtick I'm doing with the girls.

123
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:41,041
I don't have to...
The cord blood
is a perfect match,

124
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,041
but the cell volume's low,
really low.

125
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:46,000
I had the lab run it twice,

126
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,583
after everything we've done,
but...

127
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:54,041
There's only enough
to save one.

128
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,875
Why can't you

129
00:05:55,917 --> 00:05:57,875
split the blood
between the two of 'em?

130
00:05:57,917 --> 00:06:00,417
Well, if you give them
less than they need,

131
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,333
they'll reject the graft.
We had a baby.

132
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,333
We had a baby
to save their lives,

133
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,959
and it worked.

134
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,041
And now what?
What we're saying is,

135
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:12,250
we can only give one of them
the cord blood.

136
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,875
No.

137
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:16,834
I won't do that.

138
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,458
Renee--

139
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,125
I won't choose to let
one child live and another die.

140
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:22,959
I won't!

141
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,959
Okay, we could delay
the transplant.

142
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,166
We could try
another round of chemo.
The chemo isn't working.

143
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:31,041
I'll have another baby.
It took over a year

144
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,041
to get the embryos
with the right h.L.A.

145
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,291
The girls just don't have
that kind of time. I'm sorry.

146
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,709
We can't do this.

147
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,500
Live with the idea
that we, what,

148
00:06:40,542 --> 00:06:42,834
loved one more,
let one die?

149
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:45,875
I... I mean,
what do you suggest,

150
00:06:45,917 --> 00:06:48,083
we flip a coin?

151
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,083
I mean, how else
do we choose?

152
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:53,208
Try to figure out
which one's more deserving,

153
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,500
which one's gonna live
a better life?

154
00:06:55,542 --> 00:06:59,417
I mean,
they're 8 years old!

155
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,834
Renee...

156
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:05,250
If we do nothing,
they're both gonna die.

157
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:09,917
It would be easier
to live with that.

158
00:07:15,917 --> 00:07:17,834
You're 15 years old.
I thought we were catholic.

159
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:20,208
Oh, you're really gonna try
to use religion against me now?

160
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,917
Because as I recall,

161
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:23,959
the church
promotes abstinence.

162
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,041
That's no sex before marriage.

163
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:28,417
I made a mistake.
A lot of people make it.

164
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:31,542
Dink and I...
We're trying to make it right.

165
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:35,000
And the baby should have
a mother and a father.
Fine.

166
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:37,709
I will not kill dink.
The baby will have a father.

167
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,041
But you're gonna stay in school.
You're gonna have a life.

168
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,083
Your mother and I
will provide for you.

169
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:45,083
Dink isn't... he doesn't
have to take care of you.

170
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,083
He doesn't have to.
He wants to.

171
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:50,041
He loves me.
We're m.F.E.O., dad.

172
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:53,458
You're what?
Made for each other.

173
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,041
Ugh. No.

174
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,041
I need one of you
to sign a form

175
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:59,041
to let us do it.
A form?

176
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:02,041
Well... That is not
going to be happening.

177
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,667
You're not listening.

178
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:06,458
I love him, daddy.
I'm having his baby.

179
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,291
I'm going to marry him.

180
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:11,000
No, you are not.

181
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,041
Okay.

182
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:19,041
She is mad at me.

183
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,041
She's the one
who's 15 years old, pregnant

184
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:24,041
and wants to get married,
her mother won't speak to her,

185
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,041
but I'm the bad guy.
Well, like it or not, Sam,

186
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:29,083
in seven months' time, one of
these is coming out of her.

187
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,083
Huh? Yeah.
There you go, buddy.

188
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,917
Hey, buddy.

189
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:35,333
Man, it's hard to believe
they all start out like this.

190
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,333
He gonna be okay?
Yeah, aside from the fact

191
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,417
that his parents
don't want to see him.

192
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:43,041
It's like
they blame him for...

193
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,667
Not being savior enough.

194
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:47,667
He was all they could talk about
for the last nine months,

195
00:08:47,709 --> 00:08:50,667
and now they just want him
for spare parts.
They really have to choose
which girl to save?

196
00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:52,417
I know. It's awful.

197
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,417
Right now they're willing
to let both girls die

198
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:56,041
when they could save one.

199
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,041
I mean,
how's that make sense--

200
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,041
to have a cure
and not use it?

201
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,667
Parents can be
pretty screwed up sometimes.

202
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,458
Mm.

203
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,041
Nai is gonna come around, Sam.

204
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,458
Ooh.

205
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,041
There we go.

206
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:13,500
You guys are gonna
get through this.

207
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,875
Well, Sam,
w-why don't you, um...

208
00:09:22,917 --> 00:09:25,041
Tell Naomi
what you need from her?

209
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:27,583
And that way,
she can hear it from you.

210
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:28,792
Okay.

211
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:32,375
I know, uh,
that this marriage is crazy.

212
00:09:32,417 --> 00:09:35,208
But it's either that
or adoption.
No.

213
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,208
Maya could move in
with one of us,

214
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:40,375
and--and we could help
raise the baby--
no.

215
00:09:40,417 --> 00:09:42,375
Or we could
pay for everything

216
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:45,000
and--and help her live
as--as normally as possible.

217
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:47,041
No, Sam. No. No.

218
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:49,041
I am sorry.

219
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,709
I am doing the best that I can,
but I'm not like you.

220
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,709
I can't hold her hand
through this process.
I'm not holding her hand.

221
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,041
Sam, you are treating
this marriage like it is

222
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,041
a real possibility.
I didn't say that.
Did I s--

223
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:01,625
did I say that?
I don't think he said that.

224
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:04,625
I-I didn't hear it
that way.

225
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:06,917
Uh, I know
an unwanted pregnancy

226
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,458
can wreak havoc
with a relationship.

227
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:14,959
Uh, but--but you two
can get through this

228
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,041
without tearing
each other apart.

229
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,041
You wanted me to come up.
I came up.

230
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:25,792
Please. You can't even sit here
and talk about the issue...

231
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:27,792
This baby is coming.
I don't like it.

232
00:10:27,834 --> 00:10:30,000
You don't like it.
But it's coming.

233
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,250
All the choices are bad.
I know that.

234
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,792
But we can't Bury our heads
in the sand,

235
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:38,041
and you can't sit there
and say "no" to every sug--

236
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,041
that's not an option.
You know what?
Right now, I'm sorry.

237
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:44,667
Right now, you know what?
That is all that I have.

238
00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:47,959
Great. That helped.

239
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,041
Well, you know,
these things take time.

240
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,583
Absolutely, absolutely.

241
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:58,208
I think that was
a-a good start.

242
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,041
"For till
that was finished"...

243
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:03,041
She's drawn her line
in the sand.

244
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:06,041
There's nothing to do.

245
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,500
Hey, you two...

246
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:10,500
You have hung together
through this from the beginning.

247
00:11:10,542 --> 00:11:12,583
Don't let this
get between you.

248
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:15,166
It's an impossible choice.
No one could make it.

249
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,208
The thing is...

250
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,041
I can.

251
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,208
We all say
we love our kids equally,

252
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:29,083
and I love my girls,
both of 'em.

253
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,667
But put a gun to my head...

254
00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:33,375
And I could.

255
00:11:33,417 --> 00:11:35,375
I could choose.

256
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,250
What does that say
about me, hmm?

257
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:43,625
What kind of man
does that make me?

258
00:11:54,792 --> 00:11:56,000
Honey.

259
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,917
I love Niki
with all of my heart,

260
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,041
and if I could give my life
to save hers, I would.

261
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,041
You know that.

262
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:09,500
Just--i can't
watch them both die.

263
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:13,166
This isn't fair, Renee.
It's not fair for any of us.
No!

264
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:16,166
Give the cord blood to Kelli
before she gets worse.

265
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:18,000
No. I won't allow it.

266
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,500
Either they both get it
or neither.

267
00:12:20,542 --> 00:12:22,041
Renee--
no!

268
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,667
You're going to hell.

269
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,166
She's probably right.

270
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,041
I've been
doing the same thing...

271
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:44,250
E-Ever since dink mentioned
the word "marriage."

272
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:48,333
Doesn't take a doctor
to diagnose my headache.

273
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,041
Corinne Davis.
Sam Bennett.

274
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,917
Please have a seat.

275
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:53,917
Is Maya's mother
going to join us?

276
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:57,041
Uh, no. She--she--
she's tied up.

277
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,458
Oh.

278
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,417
Okay. Well, um...

279
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:05,041
I--it's just me on...
On our end, so...

280
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:09,041
I-I know this is
all awkward and awful.

281
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,041
But she's lovely,
your daughter...

282
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,875
And funny.

283
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,041
I-I do love
seeing them together.

284
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:17,041
You know Maya?

285
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,125
All the time
she spends at our house.

286
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,041
Huh.

287
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,041
They came to me
after you said no,

288
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,583
and we talked.

289
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:28,083
And, um, I have
a guesthouse in the back.

290
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:31,792
It's not huge,
but they could move in there.

291
00:13:31,834 --> 00:13:33,542
I-I work during the week,

292
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:36,166
so we're gonna have to figure
out some kind of day care.

293
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:39,000
But I-I come home early,
so I could help.

294
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,041
And dink--he'll come home
after school

295
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:43,417
or after his band practice
or something,

296
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:46,208
and--and, um, I don't know
Maya's schedule,

297
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,625
but between the three of us

298
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:50,625
and--and you and your--
well, Maya's mother,

299
00:13:50,667 --> 00:13:52,625
and whatever
you're willing to do,

300
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:56,000
I think that we can try
to help them...

301
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:57,959
Make this work.

302
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,834
So then,
you're behind this?

303
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:03,041
You're behind 2
15 year olds getting married

304
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,000
and playing house?

305
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,834
I know it's crazy.

306
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,834
I-I'm just trying
to figure it out

307
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:12,083
for myself, too, you know,
and...

308
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,875
M-Maybe it's crazy
that it's crazy, you know?

309
00:14:14,917 --> 00:14:17,250
I mean, we try and teach
our kids responsibility

310
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:22,041
and--and that family
is important.

311
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,458
I mean,
for most of history,

312
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,041
this is
when kids got married.

313
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:30,041
And--and in some parts
of the country, it still is.

314
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,667
Okay. Excuse me.

315
00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:33,750
Uh, I don't--
I don't know your son,

316
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:35,458
hardly at all.

317
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,458
But my daughter?
She's just a little girl.

318
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,750
And she doesn't need
a husband.

319
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:43,041
She certainly doesn't need
a house.

320
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:46,125
Uh, what she does need
is a high school education.

321
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:49,250
And she's going to get one.
That's exactly what I'm saying.

322
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:51,250
If she gets married,

323
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,667
she'll have someone else
to think about,

324
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:57,667
and her choices
will be limited.
Or she'll have someone who
supports her in those choices.

325
00:14:57,709 --> 00:14:59,875
Look, I know
that you are against this,

326
00:14:59,917 --> 00:15:02,250
but if you don't sign
these papers,

327
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:04,375
what happens then?

328
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:08,291
What happens if they run off
or--or worse?

329
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:12,166
Look, this isn't what I wanted
for my kid either.

330
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:15,709
But I would rather have them
close by,

331
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,709
right or wrong,

332
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:22,959
so we could pick up the pieces
no matter what happens.

333
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,625
Oh, thank god you're here.

334
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:29,041
You gotta help her.

335
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,417
What's happening?
Can someone take Kelli
out of the room, please?

336
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,709
I don't want to leave her.
It's okay, baby.

337
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,041
Just go with the nurse.
Okay, she's septic.

338
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,458
I need a c.B.C.
And a chem panel times two.

339
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,625
We're gonna set up
a central line.
What's wrong with her?

340
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:45,041
She has an infection.
She may have relapsed.
Oh, god.

Oh, my god.

Renee.

00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:52,041

This is all your fault.
I didn't make this happen.

I got dying twins.

I've got
a pregnant teenage daughter

Family trumps patients.

the dying twins' father

352
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,458

I had a book here.

Jane Austen?
You're actually reading that?
Yes.

and I love her for it.

510
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:53,041
But maybe
it would've been better

511

were to have been there.

512
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:57,333
I think
Sam's just pointing out

513
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:59,750
that two parents
could be better than one.

514
00:23:59,792 --> 00:24:01,417
Naomi...

515
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:04,041
I-I think that Sam
just wants you to think about

516
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:05,750
what the alternatives are.

517
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:12,041
I don't like it, Nai.

518
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:15,041
But...

519
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:18,583
They say
that they're m.F.E.O.

520
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,542
M-M.f.e.o.?
Oh, god.

521
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:23,959
Made for each other.
And, no, they are not, Sam.

522
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,041
They are not.

523
00:24:28,917 --> 00:24:31,875
Look, I know you want
to talk about this more,

524
00:24:31,917 --> 00:24:34,542
but I just can't.
I can't. I'm sorry.

525
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:36,667
I wish I could,
but I can't.

526
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:38,041
Okay. Well...

527
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:40,667
Dink's mother is coming back
this afternoon.

528
00:24:40,709 --> 00:24:42,750
If you can't, you can't.

529
00:24:42,792 --> 00:24:44,750
But I'm gonna have to make
some decisions

530
00:24:44,792 --> 00:24:47,333
for the both of us.

531
00:24:54,417 --> 00:24:56,375
There's no way!
I won't let this happen.

532
00:24:56,417 --> 00:24:58,208
No, you'll just watch
both girls die!

533
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:01,083
Okay. All right. Stop! Stop.
This is awful. I know it is,
whoa, whoa.

534
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,166
But you need
to take care of this for them.

535
00:25:03,208 --> 00:25:06,041
We should let Niki die?
No, you should let
one of them live.

536
00:25:06,083 --> 00:25:09,166
You should give the cord blood
to Niki because she's weak

537
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:11,500
and she needs it. You should
give it to Kelli

538
00:25:11,542 --> 00:25:13,709
so you don't lose her, too.
I don't know.

539
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:17,291
I don't know which one's best,
which you can live with.
I can't choose between
one child and another.

540
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:18,917
You already have.

541
00:25:18,959 --> 00:25:22,333
You had a baby yesterday.
You haven't even looked at him.

542
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:25,583
I want to love him.

543
00:25:27,709 --> 00:25:29,875
I just...

544
00:25:29,917 --> 00:25:34,041
I feel like
he's gonna replace them.

545
00:25:34,083 --> 00:25:37,667
I can't face that.

546
00:25:37,709 --> 00:25:40,041
No one
wants to face this.

547
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:41,792
But we have to.

548
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:52,333
Uh, can you come with me
to the exam room?

549
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:54,125
You need a consult?

550
00:25:54,166 --> 00:25:57,041
No. Maya's there.

551
00:25:57,083 --> 00:26:01,458
Maya, are you okay?
Dell said you were okay.

552
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,709
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just...

553
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:06,041
Show him.
Yep.

554
00:26:08,291 --> 00:26:09,625
Okay.

555
00:26:09,667 --> 00:26:12,208
Um... here's the heart.

556
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:14,417
It's beating strong.

557
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:16,041
And the head.

558
00:26:19,667 --> 00:26:22,000
It's pretty cool, huh?

559
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:31,750
What are you doing?

560
00:26:31,792 --> 00:26:33,667
Uh...

561
00:26:33,709 --> 00:26:35,875
Trying not to eat
the chocolate.

562
00:26:35,917 --> 00:26:38,917
How's that going for you?

563
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:40,917
Not good,
but if I eat it,

564
00:26:40,959 --> 00:26:42,917
I'm gonna have to run
for 5 miles

565
00:26:42,959 --> 00:26:44,542
on the treadmill tonight,

566
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:48,041
and I don't, uh, I don't think
I have 5 miles in me.
It's just one chocolate.

567
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:49,834
No,
it's the gateway chocolate.

568
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:51,834
I eat one, I eat them all.

569
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:53,834
It's just food, Nai.
It's not a solution.

570
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:55,250
But it's what I can do.

571
00:26:55,291 --> 00:26:58,000
Everything else, um...

572
00:26:59,542 --> 00:27:03,041
It's like I'm 13.

573
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:08,000
Yeah, I know that I am
a calm, rational person

574
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:10,000
with many graduate degrees.

575
00:27:10,041 --> 00:27:11,709
I run my own business,

576
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:15,458
and I am a strong,
smart adult.

577
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,458
And, uh, yet, I have
a 15-year-old daughter

578
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,291
who was supposed to have
a life.

579
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:23,083
And, uh...

580
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:26,458
The only way I can cope
with that is this.

581
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,458
Which is what I did
when I was 13.

582
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,458
It was always just me
and the chocolate,

583
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,041
me and the food.

584
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:34,041
And, uh, I know
it's ridiculous, and...

585
00:27:34,083 --> 00:27:37,041
I know that I am burying
my head in the sand,

586
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:40,083
but it's...
What I can do.

587
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:42,417
I can do this.
I can do this chocolate.

588
00:27:42,458 --> 00:27:45,041
I can, um... I'm in charge
of this chocolate

589
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:46,417
and my battle with food.

590
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:48,291
This I can do.

591
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:52,041
I can't do Maya
and babies and marriage.

592
00:27:53,458 --> 00:27:56,041
I know you can't.

593
00:27:56,083 --> 00:27:58,041
But you... pulling out,

594
00:27:58,083 --> 00:28:01,083
you're leaving Sam to
figure this out on his own.

595
00:28:01,125 --> 00:28:03,583
And I'm there,
and I'm trying to help,

596
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:07,417
but... I'm not...

597
00:28:07,458 --> 00:28:10,083
Even sure
how you feel about that.

598
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:12,041
Feel about what?

599
00:28:12,083 --> 00:28:14,458
Me and Sam...
Having these conversations.

600
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,041
I mean, it's just
a little weird, you know.

601
00:28:17,083 --> 00:28:20,041
I mean, we live next door
to each other, we sit and talk,

602
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:22,041
and, uh... I don't know.
It's...

603
00:28:22,083 --> 00:28:24,041
It's like--
it's--it's like...

604
00:28:24,083 --> 00:28:28,000
Sam and I are the couple.

605
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:37,417
Oh, that's funny, right?

606
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:40,792
What, you and Sam?

607
00:28:40,834 --> 00:28:44,083
Yeah, it's funny. Yeah.

608
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:46,208
Thank you for that,

609
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,625
for making me laugh.

610
00:28:48,667 --> 00:28:51,583
I needed that.
Oh, my god. You and Sam.

611
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:55,208
Oh, god. That is just wrong
on so many levels.

612
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:57,250
Oh!

613
00:28:57,291 --> 00:29:00,333
It's like, first you sleep with
your husband's best friend

614
00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:02,917
and then you sleep with
your best friend's husband.

615
00:29:02,959 --> 00:29:04,917
Oh, my god.

616
00:29:04,959 --> 00:29:07,166
You--you--you would be
the worst person ever.

617
00:29:07,208 --> 00:29:09,917
You would need
these chocolates.

618
00:29:09,959 --> 00:29:12,041
Yeah. Nuh.

619
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,041
Uh-huh.

620
00:29:14,083 --> 00:29:16,458
Mm.

621
00:29:29,542 --> 00:29:32,625
I can't do this.

622
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:34,709
I can't break their hearts.

623
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,250
You do it.

624
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:45,041
Let me?

625
00:29:56,792 --> 00:29:58,750
Are mom and dad
still fighting?

626
00:29:58,792 --> 00:30:01,542
No, no. No.

627
00:30:01,583 --> 00:30:03,458
Is something wrong
with Trevor?

628
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,375
No. He's fine.
Trevor's fine.

629
00:30:06,417 --> 00:30:08,250
But here's the thing--

630
00:30:08,291 --> 00:30:10,250
we were all hoping
that Trevor's blood

631
00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:14,041
was gonna help you both
get better.
We're not
going to get better?

632
00:30:14,083 --> 00:30:17,458
Well, Niki is too sick to have
the treatment right now.

633
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,709
Well, I'm feeling better,
though.

634
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:23,041
I know, and that's good.

635
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:27,041
But your body's too weak
for the blood to help you.

636
00:30:27,083 --> 00:30:29,959
And so we need to give it
to Kelli.

637
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:38,542
How long till I get it?

638
00:30:38,583 --> 00:30:41,834
Well, that's the thing,
sweetie.

639
00:30:41,875 --> 00:30:44,417
There just isn't enough
for both of you.

640
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:52,542
I can share
so we can both get it.

641
00:30:52,583 --> 00:30:55,542
I know. I wish that was
the way that it works.

642
00:30:55,583 --> 00:30:57,041
But it doesn't.

643
00:30:58,834 --> 00:31:01,041
But...

644
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:04,083
If we both don't get it...

645
00:31:06,083 --> 00:31:08,625
I don't want it.
I don't want it.

646
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:11,583
We do everything together,
everything the same.

647
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:21,959
But you have to get better.

648
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,834
It's lucky.

649
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:25,458
So you'll get better.

650
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,834
Okay?

651
00:31:50,625 --> 00:31:53,583
Naomi.
Mom... you came.

652
00:31:53,625 --> 00:31:56,041
Yeah, I came.

653
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:59,041
I'm... so glad
to finally meet you.

654
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,166
I'm, uh, sorry
that I was late.

655
00:32:01,208 --> 00:32:03,083
Well, i'm--I'm here.

656
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:05,542
Boy,
I-I know that this

657
00:32:05,583 --> 00:32:08,083
has been hard on all of us.

658
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:11,041
They've put us in
a difficult situation.

659
00:32:11,083 --> 00:32:15,208
I know that we all feel
a little... scared.

660
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:17,417
But we are all
in the same position, so--

661
00:32:17,458 --> 00:32:20,125
excuse me. No, we are--
we are not,

662
00:32:20,166 --> 00:32:21,875
uh, in the same position.

663
00:32:21,917 --> 00:32:24,041
Your son can walk away,
and, uh,

664
00:32:24,083 --> 00:32:26,834
my daughter is stuck with this
in her belly for nine months.

665
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:29,125
I think that you're
missing the point here.

666
00:32:29,166 --> 00:32:31,458
My son is not walking away.

667
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,834
You're missing my point.
He could.

668
00:32:33,875 --> 00:32:35,583
Mom--
Mrs. Bennett,

669
00:32:35,625 --> 00:32:37,333
I...

670
00:32:37,375 --> 00:32:40,917
Dr. Bennett, ma'am...

671
00:32:43,417 --> 00:32:45,417
I don't want to walk away.

672
00:32:48,083 --> 00:32:51,667
I appreciate that.
I do.

673
00:32:51,709 --> 00:32:54,000
But, um, this idea...

674
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:56,375
This marriage...

675
00:32:56,417 --> 00:32:58,375
I said
that I would...

676
00:32:58,417 --> 00:33:00,959
Sign the consent.

677
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,333
We all...

678
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:05,333
All of us had
a really good talk.

679
00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:09,125
You weren't here,
so... we decided.

680
00:33:09,166 --> 00:33:11,041
Mom...

681
00:33:11,083 --> 00:33:15,208
I want you to understand.

682
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:18,625
I want you
to support all of this.

683
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,333
I guess that's not
for me to say.

684
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:31,041
His name is Fillmore.

685
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:35,166
Dink--it's just...
Just a nickname...

686
00:33:35,208 --> 00:33:37,000
Ma'am.

687
00:33:53,875 --> 00:33:55,834
Jerry.

688
00:33:55,875 --> 00:33:58,208
Hey.

689
00:33:58,250 --> 00:33:59,834
Um...

690
00:33:59,875 --> 00:34:02,375
Niki needs you.

691
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:13,417
Daddy.

692
00:34:13,458 --> 00:34:16,667
I am so sorry, baby.

693
00:34:16,709 --> 00:34:18,917
Come here.

694
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:32,333
I wanted Niki to spend
some time with her brother.

695
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:05,041
I tried.

696
00:35:05,083 --> 00:35:10,041
I tried to engage,
but... I was too late.

697
00:35:10,083 --> 00:35:12,750
And now I...

698
00:35:12,792 --> 00:35:14,750
Y-You know, I used to--

699
00:35:14,792 --> 00:35:17,125
I used to think of myself
as a good person.

700
00:35:17,166 --> 00:35:20,208
You know, I was--i was
a good friend, a good mother

701
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,542
and a good ex-wife.

702
00:35:22,583 --> 00:35:26,000
But something happened,
and now I...

703
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:28,667
You know, I didn't get it.

704
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:31,792
What you went through
with Lucas and walking away,

705
00:35:31,834 --> 00:35:33,792
I didn't get it.

706
00:35:33,834 --> 00:35:36,750
And I know Maya's not like that,
but I get it now.

707
00:35:36,792 --> 00:35:41,250
I do. I'm sorry.

708
00:35:41,291 --> 00:35:43,250
You don't get it.

709
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:45,458
You don't...

710
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,458
I didn't
walk away from my child

711
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,458
because I couldn't
deal with him

712
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,291
or because I wanted
to control what he did.

713
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:54,125
For me,
walking away was

714
00:35:54,166 --> 00:35:56,500
the... most awful thing
in my life.

715
00:35:56,542 --> 00:35:59,834
But I-I made a choice...

716
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:04,834
Because I thought it was
in my child's best interest.

717
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:08,208
I was just...

718
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:11,625
Too damaged to do anything
but hurt Lucas.

719
00:36:11,667 --> 00:36:15,041
So I walked away...

720
00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:21,417
Not to avoid him
or to...

721
00:36:21,458 --> 00:36:23,417
Control him,

722
00:36:23,458 --> 00:36:26,041
but to save him.

723
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:29,041
But, Nai, you just...

724
00:36:29,083 --> 00:36:31,041
You didn't get your way.

725
00:36:31,083 --> 00:36:33,041
So you want to walk away

726
00:36:33,083 --> 00:36:36,875
to avoid figuring out
what comes next.

727
00:36:36,917 --> 00:36:39,041
I didn't get my way.

728
00:36:39,083 --> 00:36:41,125
You didn't get your way.

729
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:43,375
I didn't get my way.

730
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:51,458
So what do I do now?

731
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,458
I don't know.

732
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,458
If I had the answer
on how to be a mother,

733
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,000
I'd be doing it myself.

734
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:17,166
If I tell you something,
you can't tell anyone else.

735
00:37:17,208 --> 00:37:19,625
You're my shrink.
Those are the rules, right?

736
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:21,625
Actually,
I'm not your therapist

737
00:37:21,667 --> 00:37:23,041
or your psychiatrist.

738
00:37:23,083 --> 00:37:27,041
As I recall, we talked once,
just briefly.

739
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:29,041
Are you gonna tell anyone
or not?

740
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:31,500
Well, unless you
killed someone, I...

741
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:38,041
If I can help, I'll help.

742
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:40,041
I do have an office.

743
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:41,959
I like someone... a lot.

744
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,250
And my dating life in L.A.
has been a little... crazy.

745
00:37:45,291 --> 00:37:46,875
It's been awful and hard.

746
00:37:46,917 --> 00:37:48,875
And suddenly I meet someone
who's easy,

747
00:37:48,917 --> 00:37:50,250
and it's not hard work.

748
00:37:50,291 --> 00:37:52,250
And there's not
that awkward dance

749
00:37:52,291 --> 00:37:53,875
of "getting to know you."

750
00:37:53,917 --> 00:37:56,875
It's like... it's like
picking up on the 60th date.

751
00:37:56,917 --> 00:37:58,834
It's like what I've
been looking for

752
00:37:58,875 --> 00:38:01,500
has been right in front of me
the whole time.

753
00:38:01,542 --> 00:38:04,041
Well, it sounds... perfect.
It could be.

754
00:38:04,083 --> 00:38:07,625
But... seeing him...

755
00:38:07,667 --> 00:38:09,542
Would hurt a friend.

756
00:38:09,583 --> 00:38:12,500
You care about this friend?

757
00:38:12,542 --> 00:38:16,000
She's my closest friend.

758
00:38:16,041 --> 00:38:17,875
Ah.

759
00:38:17,917 --> 00:38:19,458
Yes, well...

760
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,667
That could be a problem.

761
00:38:21,709 --> 00:38:23,333
That's not
a helpful response.

762
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:25,959
When someone like you
poses a problem like this,

763
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,959
I-I think you know
what you want

764
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,542
and that you want it,

765
00:38:29,583 --> 00:38:32,542
and you're looking for me to
tell you that it's all right

766
00:38:32,583 --> 00:38:34,667
to do what you want.
And is it?

767
00:38:34,709 --> 00:38:36,458
I think friendship
is important.

768
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,333
And lord knows, this friend,
this woman you're talking about,

769
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:41,375
I don't want to see her

770
00:38:41,417 --> 00:38:43,542

anything else right now.

771
00:38:43,583 --> 00:38:46,208
But... if this
is really it, right,

772
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:48,333

773
00:38:48,375 --> 00:38:51,834
I don't know
that I could walk away.

774
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:03,041
You want to live here, you want
to be friends with Violet--

775
00:39:03,083 --> 00:39:04,417
that is your business,

776
00:39:04,458 --> 00:39:06,834
and I will not
make it about me.

777
00:39:06,875 --> 00:39:09,917
