1
00:00:03,291 --> 00:00:05,083
♪ Ohhh ohhh ohhh ♪

2
00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:16,917
Okay, people.
It's not a beach party.

3
00:00:16,959 --> 00:00:18,291
Let's go now.

4
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:20,333
You have
full hospital privileges.

5
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:21,959
Transplant team's
standing by.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,333
Sarah's sister's inside.
How much time do we have?

7
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:26,959
She'll go into full
renal failure within 72 hours

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,333
without the sister's kidney.

9
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:31,333
It's not a perfect match,
but the next best thing.

10
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:33,333
D--oh, hi.
Hi. Come on.

11
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:35,959
Oh, I don't get my kidney
until I dish?

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,333
That's right.

13
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:39,333
Uh, Seattle grace
is merging with mercy west,

14
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:42,333
which means half the doctors
in the city are out of a job.

15
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,333
I'm getting a divorce,
which means I'm a single mom.

16
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:46,959
Stevens has cancer.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,333
Meredith and Derek got married
on a post-it note.

18
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:52,333
And George O'Malley is dead,
but you knew that already.

19
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:55,375
Um, I don't sleep much anymore
because I lay awake at night

20
00:00:55,417 --> 00:00:57,375
and wonder
where all the joy is.

21
00:00:57,417 --> 00:00:59,000
During the day,

22
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:02,000
I realize that the joy
packed its bags and left.

23
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:05,041
The glasses of the world
are half-empty.
But... you're an attending.

24
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:07,041
I am an attending.
How are you?

25
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:08,875
I--
Dr. Bailey.

26
00:01:08,917 --> 00:01:11,583
Ah, this is our chief
of staff, Dr. Charlotte king.

27
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:13,583
Oh, I appreciate
the professional courtesy.

28
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:16,041
I hear you have a nice
little hospital here.
We're small but efficient.

29
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:18,583
You came to the best place
to get the job done...
Mm.

30
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:21,208
Right this time.

31
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,041
The donor's a single mom
with three small children

32
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:26,458
and an ex-husband
who likes to hit things.

33
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,625
Jumping on a plane
out of state's not an option.

34
00:01:29,667 --> 00:01:32,875
Otherwise, Seattle grace would
have been the obvious choice,

35
00:01:32,917 --> 00:01:35,041
cutting-edge teaching hospital
and all.

36
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:37,625
Here at St. ambrose, you'll find
the doctors don't need teaching.

37
00:01:37,667 --> 00:01:39,625
They already know
what they're doing.

38
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:41,625
Excuse me.

39
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:44,041
Sorry about that.
She's a little, uh...

40
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:47,250
I don't have to like her.
I just need her O.R.

41
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:50,417
Dr. Bailey. Well, well, well.
Look at you.

42
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:52,417
Why are we looking at me?

43
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:56,041
No, I just meant that...
I didn't mean...

44
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,458
Hello.

45
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,250
What are we waiting for?
Where's my kidney?

46
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:09,959
Bailey's here.

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,917
Sam's agreed to be
internist to both sisters.

48
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,333
Emily, this is Dr. Bailey.
She'll be performing

49
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:17,542
the transplant.
I'm ready.

50
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:19,375
Okay, well, first
we'll take you through

51
00:02:19,417 --> 00:02:21,375
the pre-surgery protocol.
You already have my file.

52
00:02:21,417 --> 00:02:24,750
I was tested as a partial match
three years ago.

53
00:02:24,792 --> 00:02:27,041
Sarah needs my kidney now.
Your sister's stabilized.

54
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:30,125
If we do this tomorrow,
we should be fine.
Sarah fought to stay alive
for three excruciating years

55
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:32,667
while you waited
to find a match.

56
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:35,291
Now somebody screwed up,
and she's dying.

57
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:38,041
She's done waiting.
I'm done waiting.
Sarah's gone through
a tremendous amount

58
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:40,041
of physical trauma
in the last 24 hours.

59
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,959
She just got off
an air ambulance.

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,959
Her system was fragile
even before she had

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,709
the failed organ transplant.

62
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,333
Now, hey, I'm the first
to admit, we made mistakes.

63
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,959
But we will not rush her
into another surgery

64
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,625
before we've got a whole slew
of tests telling us

65
00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:55,625
that she's strong enough
to handle it.

66
00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:59,041
We do this right,
or we don't do it at all.

67
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:01,041
Yes, i'm... I'm sorry.

68
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:04,000
It's just...
It's my sister.

69
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:09,667
Well, I'm going to fix this.

70
00:03:14,917 --> 00:03:16,583
Welcome back.

71
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:19,792
Oh, thank you, Sheldon.

72
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:24,125
How are ya?
No, no, not therapeutically.

73
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,750
I mean just as friends.

74
00:03:25,792 --> 00:03:27,750
You know, when someone
comes back to work,

75
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:30,125
it's a friendly question,
you know, so...

76
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,375
Well, letting that go.

77
00:03:32,417 --> 00:03:34,667
How's the baby?
You found a good nanny?

78
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:38,875
I gave him to Pete.
What?

79
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:42,041
I gave the baby to Pete.
To babysit? To--to visit?
To--to what?

80
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:44,083
To live. To be.

81
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,166
To... I...

82
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:49,041
Gave him to Pete.
Lucas could be my son.

83
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:52,041
I know.
He is your son,
and you gave him to Pete?

84
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:55,041
You gave him to Pete?
It was...
For the best.

85
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:56,917
It's for the best?
I-I have no words.

86
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,041
There are no words.
Words are not enough!

87
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:02,041
Sheldon, Sheldon,
this is my first day back.

88
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,291
I am...
Doing the best I can.

89
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:07,667
Could you just go?

90
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:09,500
Can you go?

91
00:04:09,542 --> 00:04:11,667
Well, i--
can you just--

92
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:15,208
'cause it would really help
if you would just...

93
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,125
Luke is living with you?

94
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,333
Shh.
Lucas is trying to sleep.

95
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,041
So...

96
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,500
So Violet just
gave him to you?

97
00:04:29,542 --> 00:04:31,625
What's going on, Pete,
with Violet?

98
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:33,875
She's working on things.

99
00:04:33,917 --> 00:04:38,083
Don't worry, Sheldon.
Lucas is fine.

100
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,083
Okay. Everything looks good.

101
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:48,125
Now we're gonna let Teresa
take a blood sample from you.

102
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:51,458
Uh, my blood type is a-b,
I'm r-h positive,

103
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,041
and I'm a scorpio.

104
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,709
What more do you need
to know?
Probably nothing.

105
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,542
But why don't you let us
do our job

106
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:01,667
so Dr. Bailey can do hers?
Is she good--Dr. Bailey?

107
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:04,667
Because after what happened
in Seattle--
Dr. Bailey
is one of the best.

108
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:07,458
She seems
a little, um... cold.

109
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,875
She's a surgeon.

110
00:05:09,917 --> 00:05:13,458
Uh, you want her to be quick,
decisive, and she's both.

111
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,041
She's good. You have
nothing to worry about.

112
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,166
I have three kids
to worry about.

113
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:22,291
Uh, Sarah saved us...
All of us.

114
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:25,291
I married a bad guy,
and I couldn't get out.

115
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:28,000
I just... watched my life

116
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:30,166
turn into
this terrible place.

117
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:32,625
Then Sarah flew in.

118
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:36,041
She took care of the kids,
stayed with us for six months

119
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,041
and made sure
we were all safe.

120
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:41,041
My babies don't have a dad.
They don't have grandparents.

121
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:44,041
They have me
and they have Sarah.

122
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,041
We need her.

123
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:50,083
You're giving up an organ.
We don't take that lightly.

124
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,750
Okay.

125
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,542
Oh, hey.

126
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,834
You're good with her.

127
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,834
Thanks.
How's the sister?

128
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:03,041
Oh, she's stable for now.

129
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:05,041
And you're comfortable
with this match?

130
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,166
It wasn't a good match
three years ago,

131
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,792
but with all the progress
in anti-rejection drugs,

132
00:06:09,834 --> 00:06:11,333
we'll make it work.

133
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:13,333
Hey, it's all we got.

134
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,583
Okay.

135
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,959
How are those
anxiety attacks?

136
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Asthma.
Right.

137
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,709
It was asthma.

138
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:29,041
Ryan's driving me crazy.

139
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,041
I keep telling him
that it takes time

140
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,667
to build a new immune system
from scratch, but--

141
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:36,667
but he's 16, and he's living
in suburban jail.

142
00:06:36,709 --> 00:06:39,166
Not that
it's not beautiful.

143
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,166
My man.

144
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,583
Do you know how many things
you can't do

145
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,583
while your mother
is watching every second?

146
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,250
Yeah, 2,563.

147
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:55,250
Two years, Coop.
Almost two years in a bubble.

148
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,417
Yeah, with digital cable

149
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:00,291
and Wi-Fi, dvr, DVD.

150
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:03,625
There are a lot of people
that would call that heaven.

151
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:06,667
You want me to grow up
to be a eunuch?

152
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:09,750
Spill it.
Homecoming, tomorrow.

153
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:14,041
Kelli's going, I'm not,
and Francis Stokes is.
She'd kiss a guy
named Francis?

154
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,250
Okay, look, you're gonna
get outta here.

155
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,250
It's not like the old days,
when being born

156
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,333
without an immune system
meant you have to stay

157
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,083
in a place like this forever.

158
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,917
You are getting better,

159
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:26,041
but we gotta be
really careful with scids.

160
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:29,417
And, you know, I know that this
kissing stuff feels important--
Coop, I know 16
was a long time ago,

161
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,834
but you have a girlfriend.
You have sex.

162
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:34,542
I have talk and talk.

163
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:38,041
And talk is starting to get
really... old,

164
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,750
like you.

165
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,792
That's funny. You know, talk can
actually be hard to come by.

166
00:07:42,834 --> 00:07:45,291
I think my girlfriend could
take some lessons from yours.

167
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:48,041
Ry.

168
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,542
Hey, ry.
How's the bubble boy?

169
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:53,000
She won't be
my girlfriend for long.

170
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:56,125
Isn't there something more
you can do to get me outta here?

171
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,959
I feel like I'm in a spa.

172
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,959
When will the waiter come by
with champagne?

173
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,959
Addison... uh, Dr. Bailey.
How are you?
Naomi. Right.

174
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,375
Uh, I thought
you left the practice.
Uh, I did.

175
00:08:08,417 --> 00:08:12,083
Naomi went downstairs
to run a different practice.

176
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,625
I, uh, I tried
to call you, twice.

177
00:08:14,667 --> 00:08:18,291
I know. I'm sorry.
I've just been crazy busy.

178
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:22,041
I just came up to,
you know, welcome Violet back.

179
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,542
Thought the two of you
were best friends.

180
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,542
We were. We are.
Uh, I just...

181
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:31,041
Oh, Cooper, Cooper, uh,
this is, uh, Dr. Bailey,

182
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,041
my friend from Seattle.
Oh, hey, wow. Wow.

183
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,041
You're shorter than--
than I thought.

184
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,500
I mean, given what Sam says,
and Addison, about...

185
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:40,083
That's--it's a compliment.
Um...

186
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,083
I have twins waiting.

187
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:44,125
Hope he's better with kids
than adults.

188
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:45,834
Mm.

189
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,875
Oh, Violet.

190
00:08:47,917 --> 00:08:49,583
Our therapist. Dr. Bailey.

191
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,959
Oh, hi.

192
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,792
Well, I...

193
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,166
Wait. So is she the one
you said had the baby

194
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,792
and then...
Yeah.

195
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:01,792
She's back at work?
Mm-hmm.

196
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:03,792
Oh, if that
had happened to me,

197
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,792
I'd be spending my time
in a padded room.

198
00:09:05,834 --> 00:09:07,417
Oh, is that the father?

199
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:10,208
Yeah. Well, one of 'em.
T-There's another one?

200
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,208
It's complicated.
This place
is better than a telenovela.

201
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,083
It's not a telenovela.

202
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,041
Addison?
Dr. Montgomery.

203
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,083
Morgan.
Is everything okay?

204
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:25,667
What's--what's wrong?
Did you do it?
Did you sleep with my husband?

205
00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:27,208
Uh, ahem.

206
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,834
Morgan, let's, uh--
uh, I k--he says you didn't.

207
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:32,041
And I-I just want to believe
you didn't,

208
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,667
you being my doctor and all,

209
00:09:34,709 --> 00:09:37,000
but then I found myself
outside your building.

210
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:40,000
And I knew if I didn't
ask you... tell me.
Morgan, no.

211
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:42,625
I promise you, nothing like
that ever happened.

212
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:45,458
He's telling you the truth.

213
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,250
I-I-I believe you.

214
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:49,917
I'm sorry.

215
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:53,041
I have to go.

216
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:58,041
Go ahead.
Get it off your chest.
I have nothing to say.

217
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,667
He was a heart surgeon.
She was my patient.

218
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:02,542
It's none of my business.

219
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,542
There was no sex at all.
Nothing.

220
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,458
Okay, well, we--we--
we went to first base.

221
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,041
Maybe second.

222
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,542
Se--somewhere between
first and second base--

223
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,041
I do not want to know
about your bases or your balls.

224
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:18,458
It's none of my business.
Miranda, it's you. It's me.
I know you.

225
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,333
I know you have something
to say.

226
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,542
Excuse me.
We got Emily's tests back.

227
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,500
Oh, good.
Bad.

228
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:29,709
Why? What happened?
Emily can't donate her kidney.

229
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:35,750
Excuse me. Emily, could I
speak with you for a moment?

230
00:10:35,792 --> 00:10:37,875
Told you they'd find out.

231
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:40,041
Wait. So you're aware of--
of Emily's status?

232
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:42,458
She's my sister. She knows
everything about me.

233
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,083
So it was only your doctors you
were keeping the secret from--

234
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,083
the fact that you're
h.I.V. Positive?

235
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,500
Doesn't matter.
The transplant needs to happen.

236
00:10:50,542 --> 00:10:54,041
You said it yourself,
Dr. Bailey. I'm out of time.

237
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,375
I'd rather get a.I.D.S.
Than die.

238
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:05,625
I can't believe they lied.

239
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:08,083
Well, can you blame 'em?

240
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,083
Can you put Sarah
back on dialysis?

241
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,709
No, no. We're at the end
of the line.

242
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,709
I called
the national kidney registry,

243
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,709
but, you know, she's been
waiting three years for a match.

244
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,083
They don't have one.
What about a cadaver donor?

245
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,291
No match. Nothing close.

246
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:25,834
We just hope someone dies
between now and the morning

247
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,709
or we...

248
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,750
Give Sarah Emily's kidney.

249
00:11:30,792 --> 00:11:32,959
Yeah.

250
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,125
You can't transplant
an h.I.V.-Infected organ.

251
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,125
If you put h.I.V.
Into her body

252
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,125
and then bombard
her immune system

253
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,750
with anti-rejection drugs,

254
00:11:42,792 --> 00:11:45,041
she's not just looking
at living with h.I.V.

255
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,041
She could develop
full-blown a.I.D.S.

256
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,041
Before she even leaves
the hospital.

257
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,041
She could. Or she could
live with h.I.V.

258
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,041
For the rest of her life
and be fine.

259
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:56,041
What about Emily?
She's already been compromised.

260
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,041
I mean, is there data
that tells us

261
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,625
what losing a kidney does
to someone with h.I.V.?

262
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:03,041
What part of "there is no time"
do you not understand?

263
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:05,166
What part of "illegal"
do you not understand?

264
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:07,166
Oh, the laws were created
years ago,

265
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,792
back when h.I.V.
Was a death sentence.

266
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:11,458
They're outdated.
Out--

267
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,041
it's not relevant. A.I.D.S.
Is treatable now, okay?

268
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:17,041
Death isn't.
You are playing god.

269
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:21,417
I'm a surgeon.
It's how we pass the time.
Dr. Bailey, we both want
to save your patient.

270
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:24,041
But you can't expect me
to back you on this.

271
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm putting my foot down. Okay?
My--my--my foot is down.

272
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,792
Your foot is down?
Your foot is down?

273
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:32,166
Oh, oh, no. You better
pick that foot up

274
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:34,500
and use it
to walk away from me.

275
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,291
You're
the infectious disease guy.

276
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:41,041
You gotta help me out here.
There's gotta be something.

277
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,041
He's not ready yet.
It's one dance.

278
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:46,041
And then his girl's gonna
be there with some other guy.

279
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,834
Lisa Baxter--she was
my lab partner in chem,

280
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,625
which was great,
because normally a guy like me

281
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:54,041
would not have a chance
with a girl like Lisa.

282
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,625
But, you know, I made her laugh,
so we got to talk.

283
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:58,625
And she realized
my inherent charms.

284
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:01,667
Anyway... I get up the nerve
to ask her to winter formal,

285
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:04,500
and she says yes right before
my parents tell me

286
00:13:04,542 --> 00:13:07,500
that we're going to des moines
to my cousin ira's bar mitzvah.
My heart's breaking, Coop.

287
00:13:07,542 --> 00:13:10,041
Okay, well, that was it.
By the time I got back,

288
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,166
she was dating this beefy guy
named Ted,

289
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,917
and I never got my shot.
Are we doing this
for you or for him?

290
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,125
Oh, don't grow up on me now,
Pete. His count's borderline.

291
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:20,083
You boost people all the time.
You know it could help.

292
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:22,083
And if his numbers
are normal...

293
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,125
Come on. Let's let the kid
get the girl.

294
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,083
Violet.

295
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,959
I am unimaginably sorry

296
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,542
about what happened
to you, Violet.

297
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:47,542
And I'm sorry you and Pete
aren't working out,

298
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:51,000
but... you gave away a child
that wasn't yours to give.

299
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,583
I mean, i-it could be,
but--but we don't know.

300
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,083
And I need to know.

301
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,125
I need to know, Violet,
if he's my son.

302
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:05,291
I want you to agree
to a paternity test.

303
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,125
Okay.

304
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,083
What?

305
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,709
Fine.

306
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,375
Whatever. Do it.

307
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:21,667
So what do we think,

308
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:23,333
corsage or no corsage?

309
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,041
No corsage.

310
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,166
I kinda like the idea
of pinning it on. You know...

311
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,792
Yeah, we know...
Romeo.

312
00:14:29,834 --> 00:14:32,125
And I'm done.
I'm gonna be good?

313
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:35,166
Well, we'll see. Your c-d-4
has to be above 200.

314
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:39,041
So what do you think,
kiss her while we're dancing

315
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,250
or wait
and take her outside after?

316
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,959
What?

317
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,041
Look, I... I want him
to be happy.

318
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:50,333
He's kept
such a good attitude.

319
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,000
I thought it would be
easier this time

320
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:55,041
because I'd been through it.

321
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,375
That was stupid.

322
00:14:57,417 --> 00:15:01,000
The idea of losing your child
doesn't get easier.

323
00:15:04,834 --> 00:15:07,041
You have kids?

324
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,041
Yes.

325
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,041
Then you know...

326
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,250
That feeling.

327
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:17,375
She's getting worse.

328
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,375
We've contacted
every donor list.

329
00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:21,375
Hopefully we'll find
another match.

330
00:15:21,417 --> 00:15:23,000
And when they don't?

331
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,375
Let's cross that bridge...

332
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,041
Are you okay?

333
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,458
I've spent
the past 12 hours

334
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,750
thinking about death.

335
00:15:37,792 --> 00:15:39,750
Sarah dying tomorrow,

336
00:15:39,792 --> 00:15:42,041
Emily's h.I.V.
Turning into a.I.D.S.

337
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,667
And her dying

338
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,667
and leaving her three babies
with no one,

339
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:47,750
someone dying
so I can have a kidney.

340
00:15:47,792 --> 00:15:49,750
I've been sitting in the E.R.

341
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:54,542
Just hoping some 24 year old
on a motorcycle with no helmet

342
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,542
bites it on the freeway

343
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:59,250
and by some miracle
is a match.

344
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,375
I'm sick
of thinking about death.

345
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,667
I want a paternity test.

346
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:15,667
Have you talked to Violet?

347
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:18,041
I have her consent, yeah.
Okay, what about Pete?

348
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,542
What about me what?

349
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:24,041
I want Addison to perform
a paternity test on Lucas.
No.

350
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:27,000
How soon can you do this?
I said no.

351
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:30,041
Uh, guys, guys, let's just
take a deep breath.
If I take any more breaths,
I'm gonna hyperventilate.

352
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:32,500
Just do the test.
Addison, you can't do this.
You don't have--

353
00:16:32,542 --> 00:16:35,041
then I'll get someone else.
I want to know.

354
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:38,041
Well, I know. I look at him
and I already know.
You want me
to diagnose that, Pete?

355
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:40,417
It's denial.
You asked me
to take care of them.

356
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,834
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
 That's what I've been doing.

357
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:46,041
When she was with you. I didn't
say you could raise my child.
He's not your child!

358
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,917
I will get a lawyer
if I have to.

359
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:49,709
- I have the mother's consent.
- Don't do it.

360
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,625
All right, guys, guys.
It doesn't have to--
do the test.

361
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:55,625
Sheldon, please.
We don't have to go this far.

362
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:57,667
I hate this day.

363
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,917
I'm sorry
about your patient.

364
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,625
I figured I'd pour you
a glass more than half-full.

365
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:11,542
When did you become
an optimist?

366
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:15,542
I'm not. I just saw
that you were brooding.

367
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:18,041
Oh. Not brooding.

368
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:20,625
Just checking out
the local scenery.

369
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:24,041
Am not.
I do not check out scenery.

370
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:26,583
I think it's great.
You're single. He's single.

371
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,583
I mean, you know,
there were sparks.

372
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,333
Just tell me something.

373
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:33,625
Just tell me how come
all anybody thinks about is sex?

374
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:35,625
Why is that
all you doctors do,

375
00:17:35,667 --> 00:17:38,333
sleep with each other?
I did not sleep with Noah.

376
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:41,375
Okay, look, maybe I thought
about sleeping with him,

377
00:17:41,417 --> 00:17:43,834
but I didn't do it. I did
the right thing this time.

378
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,834
I did not sleep with him. I
tried to fire her as a patient.

379
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:49,041
I stopped things with Noah
before they went too far.

380
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,041
For the record,
in case you're wondering.

381
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,792
I wasn't.
Okay, you know, you think
you're doing me a favor

382
00:17:53,834 --> 00:17:56,792
by not saying anything, but it's
written all over your face.

383
00:17:56,834 --> 00:18:01,291
So you might as well just say it
before your head explodes.
Husband's best friend,
patient's husband--

384
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,625
where I come from, that's
called a bad track record.

it was a moment, Cooper,
a moment.

Good. Good.

446
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:46,583

449
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,208
I just hope it helps,
you know?

450
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:58,041
I hope you and Noah...
Get--put this behind you.

451

but you can kiss the girl.

457
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:26,667

00:21:28,542 --> 00:21:31,041

460
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,041

What?

461
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:36,333
Wait.

462
00:21:38,709 --> 00:21:40,125
What?
Your mom has a fever.

463
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:43,125
You're burning up.
You could have the flu.

464
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:45,709
I'm sorry, ry.
I'm so sorry.

465
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,041
I thought it was a headache.
No!

466
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:51,041
His numbers are there.
His system's compromised.

467
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:54,041
I'm fine. I feel fine.
Ryan, there'll be
other dances.

468
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:58,333
I asked you for a consult,

469
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:01,458
not to make decisions
without consulting me.
You're trying so hard
to be his friend,

470
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,375
you've lost sight
of what's best for him.
Having a life
is what's best for him,

471
00:22:04,417 --> 00:22:06,917
and seeing that girl
is what's best for him.
And what's best
for his mother,

472
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:09,291
risking her son's life
so he can get kissed?

473
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:12,709
That's her kid, Cooper. Can you
imagine what she goes through?
Look, Pete, I know
you're a dad now

474
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,709
and it's a big, bad world
out there,

475
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,709
but you want to tell me
what's going on here?

476
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,917
Sheldon wants
a paternity test.

477
00:22:19,959 --> 00:22:21,959
Violet said yes.

478
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:30,500
Her "t" waves are peaked.
Potassium's too high.

479
00:22:30,542 --> 00:22:34,917
Her organs
are shutting down.

480
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:38,709
Okay, uh, let's increase
her morphine.

481
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:44,000
No.

482
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:49,959
Bailey, look at me.
You can't.

483
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,333
Sh-she's dying.

484
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:53,959
There isn't another kidney
to transplant.

485
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,959
Okay, just no more waiting.

486
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,041
Just... they both know
the risks.

487
00:22:58,083 --> 00:23:00,208
You think Charlotte king
is gonna let you do

488
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,959
an illegal surgery?
I've dealt with tougher chiefs
than Charlotte king.

489
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,542
What, so that's it?
You--you feel guilty,

490
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:08,959
so you're just gonna forget
what everybody else has to say,

491
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,750
forget about the law,
forget--
I don't have time for this.

492
00:23:11,792 --> 00:23:13,750
Yeah, walk away, Bailey.
Just walk away.

493
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:15,792
You--you know what?
No, you're--you're right.

494
00:23:15,834 --> 00:23:18,208
When I first got here, I was
guilty about what happened.

495
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,208
But I was acting as a doctor,

496
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,375
a surgeon,
'cause that's my job...
Oh.

497
00:23:22,417 --> 00:23:26,041
To cut through the bull
and save the patient.
Please don't pull
the surgeon card.

498
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:28,041
We're all doctors
around here.

499
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:30,041
It's a personality thing.
Okay, yeah.

500
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:33,792
I-I've seen you long enough
to see that you're good,

501
00:23:33,834 --> 00:23:36,166
but you hang back,
you watch, you decide.

502
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:38,166
I act.

503
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:41,834
I don't stand outside a room
watching my life pass me by,

504
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:46,000
and I won't stand by
and watch this patient die.

505
00:23:50,542 --> 00:23:52,041
This isn't about lawsuits

506
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:54,041
or red tape
or hospital bureaucracy.

507
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:57,041
This is about a girl
who came to us for help,

508
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:59,083
and we couldn't give it.

509
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:03,208
And now we're telling her
to just die quietly.

510
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,208
Seattle grace
is on the hook here

511
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,959
if this girl dies.

512
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,333
The law is antiquated here,
and you know it.

513
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:12,250
The question is,
are you a by-the-book chief

514
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:15,291
or a do-what's-right chief?
This usually work for you,

515
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:17,917
this kind of
blatant manipulation?
Usually.

516
00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:19,709
Yeah, me, too.

517
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,875
This is the right thing to do,
the human thing.

518
00:24:22,917 --> 00:24:26,041
I'll talk to some staff, see if
I can get a team together.

519
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:28,041
What the hell, right?

520
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:31,000
What are they gonna do, drag us
off to jail for saving lives?

521
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:33,083
They might.

522
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:36,375
Addison was wrong
about you.

523
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:44,166
What are you doing?
You just gonna let Sheldon

524
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:47,041
go ahead and have
a paternity test?
Yes.

525
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:49,750
You gave the baby to Pete.
You can't just--

526
00:24:49,792 --> 00:24:52,041
I can. I did. It's done.

527
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:55,083
No, we have to talk about this.
We're gonna talk about this.
Don't, don't, don't,
don't touch me.

528
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:57,291
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

529
00:24:57,333 --> 00:25:00,792
I cannot let you just toss
your child to the wind.
Okay, well, what do
you want from me?

530
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:03,709
I want you to care, Violet.
This is your child.

531
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,709
Don't you think
I want to care?

532
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,500
Don't you think I would
give anything to care,

533
00:25:08,542 --> 00:25:11,917
to have a feeling, to be happy,
sad, angry, anything?

534
00:25:11,959 --> 00:25:13,291
I...

535
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:17,583
I can't feel anything,
Cooper.

536
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:19,959
Do you know
what that's like?

537
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,959
It's like not being able
to taste.

538
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,041
It's like remembering
what food is like.

539
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:27,041
Like you can smell chocolate,
but you can't taste it.

540
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:30,041
You can't get the sensation
when it's on your tongue.

541
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:31,750
I want to care.

542
00:25:31,792 --> 00:25:35,041
I want to be a person
who cares about her son.

543
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:38,041
But my insides are dead.

544
00:25:38,083 --> 00:25:41,000
I am rotting
from the inside out.

545
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:43,375
And I wish
there was some pill,

546
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:45,959
there was something
to fix this,

547
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,959
but there isn't.

548
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,875
All I have is my work.

549
00:25:50,917 --> 00:25:54,041

All the way home,
I kept trying to figure out

577
00:27:20,208 --> 00:27:23,250
why I don't feel better.
Did you, uh, you want
to go into my office?

Oh, where you

that knowing your husband
had stayed faithful

582
00:27:32,709 --> 00:27:34,667
would--would be a relief,

583
00:27:34,709 --> 00:27:36,166
but I feel worse.

584
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:38,166
I feel worse
because if it was sex,

585
00:27:38,208 --> 00:27:40,375
he could get over sex.

586
00:27:40,417 --> 00:27:44,083
Sex is biological.
Sex is carnal.

587
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:47,166
Sex is... forgivable.

588
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:50,208
But I see
what this did to him,

589
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:53,125
and I see the look
in your eyes,

590
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:56,959
and I keep thinking,
if it wasn't sex...

591
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,417
Did you...

592
00:28:00,458 --> 00:28:03,041

have sex? What does it matter
if he thinks about you?

596
00:28:11,208 --> 00:28:13,750
He thinks about you.

597
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:16,208
No matter what he says,
no matter what he does...

598
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:19,041
For the rest of our marriage,

599
00:28:19,083 --> 00:28:21,041
you're gonna be there
in my head.

600
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:24,000
I'm gonna be wondering
if he's thinking about you.

601
00:28:24,041 --> 00:28:26,041
You said nothing happened.

602
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:29,875
It's a lie,
and you know it.

603
00:28:34,208 --> 00:28:37,000
I know Dr. King
asked for your help,

604
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:39,000
but I just want to reiterate,

605
00:28:39,041 --> 00:28:41,166
there could be
negative ramifications

606
00:28:41,208 --> 00:28:43,333
if you assist
in this operation.

607
00:28:43,375 --> 00:28:46,375
So if any one of you
want to back out,

608
00:28:46,417 --> 00:28:49,083
now would be the time.

609
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:55,500
I'm sorry.

610
00:28:55,542 --> 00:28:58,834
I won't tell anyone,
but I can't do this.

611
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:06,875
We'll do it without him.
I can only back you
so far.

612
00:29:06,917 --> 00:29:09,917
Without a proper team,
it's a no go.

613
00:29:09,959 --> 00:29:12,417
Uh, she has a full team.

614
00:29:12,458 --> 00:29:15,041
I did a surgical residency.

615
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:19,000
I didn't always
stand by and watch.

616
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:23,875
Okay, we're losing time.
Let's scrub in.

00:29:26,583 --> 00:29:28,542

618

No.

620
00:29:32,291 --> 00:29:35,041

621
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:37,041

622
00:29:37,083 --> 00:29:39,834
I mean, you're probably right

Oh, my god.

626
00:29:45,542 --> 00:29:47,667

and get a cooling blanket.

677
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,583
Come on.
Pulse ox is 88.
Get him on a high-flow mask.

678
00:31:48,625 --> 00:31:51,792
Ryan. Ryan, come on.
Stay with us, Ryan. Hey!

679
00:31:51,834 --> 00:31:55,000
It's okay.
Best night of my life.

680
00:31:55,041 --> 00:31:58,208
Pressure's dropping. Let's set
him up for a central line.

681
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:01,709
We gotta get him
into an iso room.
On my count. One, two, three.

682
00:32:05,083 --> 00:32:08,041
We're gonna
put you under now.

683
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:10,417
Take good care of her, okay?
How about you tell us

684
00:32:10,458 --> 00:32:13,125
about those beautiful babies
of yours,

685
00:32:13,166 --> 00:32:15,291
and we'll take care
of the rest?

686
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,208
Um...

687
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:20,458
Uh, Lily--
she's the oldest.

688
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:25,667
She's got the biggest eyes
you've ever...

689
00:32:25,709 --> 00:32:28,625
Okay, everybody.

690
00:32:28,667 --> 00:32:30,667
Let's do this.

691
00:32:33,083 --> 00:32:35,875
You're still here.

692
00:32:35,917 --> 00:32:38,250
Yeah. Waiting to hear
from Bailey.

693
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:41,250
I think she's gonna need
a ride back from the hospital.

694
00:32:41,291 --> 00:32:43,750
Oh.
You look like I feel.

695
00:32:43,792 --> 00:32:45,959
Oh, it's been
that kind of day.

696
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,542
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
I got it. I got it.

697
00:32:48,583 --> 00:32:51,000
- I got it. I got it.
- Okay.

698
00:32:51,041 --> 00:32:53,458
Must be nice to be a baby.

699
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,166
Haven't made any mistakes,

700
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:57,041
had any fights...

701
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,667
Said anything
you can't take back.

702
00:33:00,709 --> 00:33:06,041
No, everything's ahead
for you...

703
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:08,917
Best friends, hmm?

704
00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:10,875
First love.

705
00:33:10,917 --> 00:33:13,041
First kiss.

706
00:33:14,291 --> 00:33:17,792
Mm. Right now...
All I want to do

707
00:33:17,834 --> 00:33:20,166
is take my son,
drive down to Mexico

708
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:22,166
and get away
from all this.

709
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:25,041
It's tough to do
the right thing.

710
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:28,041
It's tough to do
the right thing.

711
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:42,041
What's wrong?

712
00:33:42,083 --> 00:33:44,041
Is everything okay?

713
00:33:44,083 --> 00:33:46,583
I couldn't sleep.
I-I couldn't... be alone.

714
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:48,583
I had to get
out of that house.

715
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:51,041
Look, you may not get it,
'cause, um,

716
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:53,041
well, you're a mother
and, um...

717
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:54,542
You love your kid.

718
00:33:54,583 --> 00:33:57,041
And you're--you're good,

719
00:33:57,083 --> 00:33:59,041
so you may not get it.

720
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:01,208
But, um, you know,
you know me,

721
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:04,750
and you haven't tried to...

722
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:06,750
I need a friend.

723
00:34:06,792 --> 00:34:10,208
I just--i need a friend
who will let me sit

724
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:14,125
and maybe drink
and not talk about anything.

725
00:34:14,166 --> 00:34:16,041
Do you get that?

726
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:18,959
I do.

727
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,792
I get it.

728
00:34:21,834 --> 00:34:23,333
More suction.

729
00:34:23,375 --> 00:34:25,375
I need to see
what I'm doing.

730
00:34:25,417 --> 00:34:29,166
All right,
retract the rectus muscle.

731
00:34:29,208 --> 00:34:32,625
I'm placing the kidney.

732
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:42,041
Okay.

733
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:47,041
All right, her blood pressure's
dropping. 90 over 60.

734
00:34:47,083 --> 00:34:50,291
She's throwing p.V.C.S?
What the hell?
All right.

735
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:53,291
Her neck veins are distended.
It's pericardial tamponade.

736
00:34:53,333 --> 00:34:56,041
You need a pericardial window
to drain the fluid

737
00:34:56,083 --> 00:34:57,583
from around her heart.

738
00:34:57,625 --> 00:34:59,625
All right, someone page
a cardiothoracic surgeon.

739
00:34:59,667 --> 00:35:01,792
No, there's no time.
Betadine.

740
00:35:01,834 --> 00:35:06,041
Give me a 15 blade
and a Metz.
What--what are you doing?
We need a surgeon.

741
00:35:06,083 --> 00:35:08,834
I've done this before.
I can do this. 15 blade.
Are you out of your mind?

742
00:35:08,875 --> 00:35:11,208
Give me the scalpel!

743
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:13,959
2-inch vertical incision...

744
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,083
Subxiphoid.

745
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:19,959
Okay.

746
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,709
Peel the peritoneum...

747
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:23,917
Off the diaphragm.

748
00:35:23,959 --> 00:35:25,959
Okay. 11 blade.

749
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,917
Extend the incision.

750
00:35:31,959 --> 00:35:33,375
Pressure?

751
00:35:33,417 --> 00:35:37,333
70 over 50 and dropping.

752
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:43,291
Damn it.
Well, keep doing
what you're doing.

753
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:44,667
Okay.

754
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:47,000
Okay, I can feel the heart.
Got it.

755
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:50,041
All right, poole suction.

756
00:35:50,083 --> 00:35:52,041
I got this. Come on.

757
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:54,792
Come on now.

758
00:35:54,834 --> 00:35:56,667
Pressure's rising.

759
00:35:56,709 --> 00:35:58,041
80.

760
00:35:58,083 --> 00:36:00,750
90.

761
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:03,875
I got it. I got it.

762
00:36:03,917 --> 00:36:05,709
Good. Okay.

763
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:09,291
Why don't you go ahead
and connect that kidney?

764
00:36:19,667 --> 00:36:22,834
What the hell
just happened in there?

765
00:36:22,875 --> 00:36:25,041
I did a surgical residency
in cardiothoracic.

766
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:27,291
Well, haven't you ever--

767
00:36:27,333 --> 00:36:30,291
I don't talk about why.
Why is nobody's business.

768
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:33,291
You are an infuriating...

769
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:37,083
Tiny... little woman.

770
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:39,375
Excuse me.

771
00:36:41,625 --> 00:36:43,625
I'm gonna kiss you.

772
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:49,000
Okay.

773
00:37:00,792 --> 00:37:03,750
I--I'm sorry.

774
00:37:03,792 --> 00:37:05,667
I'm sorry.

775
00:37:05,709 --> 00:37:10,125
You think you have
everything all figured out.

776
00:37:10,166 --> 00:37:12,583
But you don't know anything,
do you?

777
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:20,834
Uh...

778
00:37:27,291 --> 00:37:29,250
So these
two psychiatrists meet

779
00:37:29,291 --> 00:37:32,041
at their
20th college reunion, right?

780
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:35,083
Uh...

781
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:37,583
When I'm anxious,
sometimes I, uh...

782
00:37:37,625 --> 00:37:40,417
It's not
a very funny joke, really,

783
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:43,041
although the punch line
always makes me laugh.

784
00:37:43,083 --> 00:37:45,000
It's a freudian slip.

785
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:51,041
Look,
however this turns out--

786
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:52,709
we'll have the answer.

787
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,625
Yes.

a cardiothoracic surgeon?

you have feelings.
