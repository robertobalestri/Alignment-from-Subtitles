no.

if you want to

tell me why she's coming.

You can ask her yourself.

Where are you going?
Just wanted to make sure
you showed up.

00:01:53,709 --> 00:01:55,083

you can't just...

Bizzy's here.
What is going on?

22
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:03,625
Ask your mother.

23
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:10,500
You cut your hair.

24
00:02:10,542 --> 00:02:14,458

So, um...

27
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:20,542
The captain was here,

28
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:22,542
but he left us
to chat, bizzy.

29
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:24,542
It was a dreadful flight--

30
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:26,083
dreadful staff,
dreadful food.

31
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,041
I'm gonna make a complaint
to Wilson.

32
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:29,542
Right.

33
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,041
I cannot believe
you moved to this place,

34
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:33,583
but here I am,

35
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:35,041
yes, about that.

36
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:37,583
I was surprised that you
actually came to visit. Uh--

37
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:40,625
Addison, don't push.

38
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:42,792
You know, short hair
isn't for everyone.

39
00:02:42,834 --> 00:02:45,250
Some people look older
with it.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,291
And the geraniums bloomed.

41
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,834
They're absolutely gorgeous.

42
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,834
I think we'll win first place
this year at new haven.

43
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:01,083
The silvermans' tulips
were...

44
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,542
You could cut
the tension with a knife,

45
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,542
but they're smiling,
they're drinking,

46
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:08,667
they're chatting
about flowers.

47
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:11,667
Hmm. Trust me, they are not
chatting about flowers.

48
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:14,333
They are speaking wasp.

49
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,542
We learn it
at an early age.

50
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:19,125
What are they saying?
See? Now that's the thing.

51
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,583
Usually I know,

52
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:24,542
but this time,
I have no idea.

53
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:27,792
Maybe I'm crazy. I mean,
maybe everything is fine,

54
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:30,959
which would be creepy
because nothing is ever fine.

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,166
Oh, here she comes.
Ah, Mrs. Montgomery.

56
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:36,041
Now, Samuel, how many times
have I told you

57
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,750
to call me bizzy?

58
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:41,458
Yes, Mrs. Montgom--
bizzy. Ma'am.

59
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:45,208
What is that?

60
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,041
Milo. I've decided to
give up men and get a cat.

61
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,625
Don't say that.
That's so sad.

62
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:53,417
People will believe you.

63
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:56,041
And you'll have to
lock it up or something.

64
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:59,917
Well, if your father and I
are gonna be staying here...
Stay here?

65
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:02,625
Let me just
get that for you.

66
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:06,375
So, bizzy, uh, what brings
you here to L.A.?

67
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,041
Excuse me.

68
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,041
Huh.

69
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,667
Yes.

70
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:16,959
Sam?
It's Dell.

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,959
Dell,
what happened?

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,208
I-I don't know. The house,
it just exploded.

73
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,083
It had to have been a gas leak.
I don't know.
It's okay.

74
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:26,041
24-year-old female,
extensive second-

75
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,083
and third-degree burns,
possible inhalation injury.

76
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:33,041
B.p.'s 100 over 60.
Pulse 130.

77
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,291
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

78
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,458
On my count. Ready?
One, two, three.

79
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,041
One, two, three.
I need high-flow 0-2.
I'm gonna need a blood gas

80
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,041
and a carboxyhemoglobin.
We're on it, Cooper.

81
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,041
I-I tried to get 'em
both out, but--but the flames--

82
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,250
I could hear Heather screaming,
but I couldn't see anything,

83
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:49,166
so I got Betsey. By the time
I got to Heather, she...

84
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,709
I-I could--i-i couldn't
get them both.
Dell, you did
all the right things.

85
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,041
Let's get a liter
of lactated ringers.
Hey, do you mind? You're
interfering with our protocol.

86
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,875
Okay, guys.
You have to let my team work.

87
00:04:57,917 --> 00:05:00,458
- They do this every day.
- It's not Dell every day.

88
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,041
I know that.
Now step back, both of you.
I-I need to be
with both of them.

89
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:06,041
What do i--
Pete, go with Heather.
You go with your daughter.

90
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:09,375
Okay, let's move.
I'll get you an update as soon
as I can, Dell. Let's go.

91
00:05:09,417 --> 00:05:11,959
Please don't let her die.

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,959
Get out of the way now.

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Let's go,
let's go, let's go!

94
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,417
Okay, Heather.

95
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,417
No! Betsey!
Heather, you're--

96
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,417
where's Betsey?!
You need to keep
the mask on.

97
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,417
No!
Heather, you need
to keep the mask on.

98
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:32,041
Where's Betsey?!
Betsey is alive.
She's unconscious.

99
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,417
Aah!
She's in the E.R.
Cooper is working on her.

100
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:37,291
Dell is with her. Now you need
to keep the mask on.

101
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,834
She's got second-
and third-degree burns

102
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:42,041
over 60% of her body.

103
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:45,083
Her lungs have sustained
severe inhalation injuries.
We should have
an ecmo unit standing by.

104
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,834
I've already ordered it.
Let's give her morphine.

105
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,291
Do you know her well?
I used to work
with her husband.

106
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,500
What's the prognosis?
In my experience,

107
00:05:52,542 --> 00:05:55,875
30% chance of survival.

108
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:03,834
Dell, I'm so sorry.

109
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:07,041
Is there anything--
anything we can do?
I--I'm supposed to deliver
the Higgins baby.

110
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:10,000
They're gonna
be waiting for me.
I-I already
took care of it.

111
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:13,166
The on-call doctor
is gonna deliver. It's fine.
Okay.

112
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,166
Did I give my insurance card?

113
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,333
They're gonna--
they're gonna need it.

114
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:21,166
Dell, I'll--I'll make sure they
have all the information, okay?

115
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,625
Hey.

116
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:26,750
Hey, Dell, I took a look
at Betsey's C.T. scan.

117
00:06:26,792 --> 00:06:28,792
She has a moderate
brain contusion

118
00:06:28,834 --> 00:06:31,041
and she also has
carbon monoxide poisoning.

119
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:34,208
Now most people
wake up in a few hours,

120
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:38,291
but because she's so small,
it's gonna take a little longer.

121
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:44,875
Heather--how is she?
I don't have an update
on Heather from Pete yet.

122
00:06:44,917 --> 00:06:48,041
But they know
what caused the explosion.

123
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:50,417
Okay.
Maybe we should go outside.

124
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:53,250
Just say it.
Um...

125
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:55,166
Heather was cooking meth.

126
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,125
They think it was ether.

127
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,208
Dell, we've got Heather
stabilized.

128
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,041
She's asking for you. I know
you don't want to leave Betsey,

129
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,875
but it...

130
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:17,542
Heather.

131
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,917
Don't try to speak.

132
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,291
Can you hear me?

133
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:25,291
Can you understand me?

134
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,000
Good.

135
00:07:30,792 --> 00:07:34,750
I hope you die, bitch.

136
00:07:34,792 --> 00:07:37,792
You almost killed
my daughter.

137
00:07:37,834 --> 00:07:41,041
I hope you die
a miserable...

138
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:44,667
Painful, agonizing death.

139
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:59,375
You're almost there,
Heather. Almost there.

140
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:01,917
After this, we're gonna
test your lung function.

141
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:06,000
Help us decide
our next move, okay?
He hates me. He wants me to die.
Just let me die.

142
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:08,041
Heather, listen to me.
You can't give up.

143
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:10,000
Dell doesn't want you to die.

144
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,000
He's upset
and he's worried about Betsey.

145
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:14,000
But you gotta fight, okay?
You gotta fight.

146
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,041
Give me more drugs. Please.
Just make it stop!

147
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,583
Okay, Heather.
Oh!

148
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:22,333
- He said that?
- He's upset.

149
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:25,333
It's his way of dealing
with a tragic situation.
To tell somebody

150
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:28,000
who's fighting for their life
you want them to die?

151
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:31,125
I don't care what she did.
That's crossing a line.
He couldn't have meant it.

152
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:35,125
Do you guys think he knew that
Heather was doing drugs again?

153
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,041
I got you all coffee.

154
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,834
I'm gonna go check
on Heather.

155
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,125
I didn't know about the drugs.

156
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:51,166
I wouldn't have put Betsey
in danger like that if I knew...

157
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,041
Since you
were all wondering.

158
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,041
Dell, no o--
no one thought--

159
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,041
it's cold in here.
She hates the cold.

160
00:08:57,083 --> 00:09:00,792
You know, she's always asking
for more blankets at night.

161
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:08,041
She needs another blanket.
Okay, you know what, Dell?

162
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:10,625
Why don't--we're gonna go
and talk to a nurse

163
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:13,000
and see if we can
get some more, okay?

164
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,417
God, can you believe
all this?

165
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,583
I know.

166
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,041
I feel terrible.

167
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,041
I-I feel like I really
should've pushed him harder.

168
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,041
I should've made him
really think

Nai, there's nothing
you could've done differently,

171
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:32,458
nothing anyone
could've done differently.
Well, maybe you're right.
I don't know.

172
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,834
Hey, wait. Let--let--let's just
have a 1-minute mental break.
Sure. Maya?

173
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:40,583
Same--hating me and loving
pink or rink or dink.

174
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,500
Whatever his name is.
Bizzy?

175
00:09:42,542 --> 00:09:44,458
The same--
cocktails, cold smiles--

176
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,041
you know, maternal.

177
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,291
Something's going on, but--

178
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,083
Bizzy.

179
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,041
Yes.

180
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:56,041
I will pick up some more
on the way home.

181
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,041
Bye.
Crisis?

00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,291
More gin.
Oh, I'm sorry.

Susan? What...

186
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:13,542
Oh, what are you doing here?
Hi.

187
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,709
Oh, my god. You look great.
You look...

188
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,709
How long has it been?
You look exactly the same.
Oh, about eight years,
and I look a mess.

189
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,750
You have your mother's skin.

190
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:22,750
Oh.
So how is it?

191
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:24,125
She's driving me crazy.
Mm.

192
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:27,709
He is driving me crazy. I don't
know how you work for them.

193
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,333
Remember to breathe
and many cocktails.

194

What are you doing here?

195
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,000
You know bizzy's rule--
wherever she goes, I go.
Susan, why is she here?

196
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:40,041
I have no idea.
She didn't tell you?
You really don't know?

197
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:42,458
Let's go face the dragon?

198
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,291

201
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:51,875
Susan.

202
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:54,333
I brought the documents
for the Houston charity ball.

203
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:57,000
Hello, captain.

204
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:07,750
Who wants... a drink?

205
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,166
Excuse me.

206
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,959
You're turning down drinks?

207
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,125
Good night, Addison.

208
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,542
Did something happen
with Dell?
No, no.

209
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:30,125
Susan--she runs the family
office. Do you remember her?

210
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:33,041
I like her. I mean, she's close
in age to me, you know,

211
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,041
and she would
do things for me.

212
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:37,041
She would deal
with my mother for me.

213
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:41,041
A-A-Anyway, she's been working
for us for 20 years.

214
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,375
She's like one of the family.
She shows up here and...

215
00:11:43,417 --> 00:11:45,041
And what is it?

216
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,375
I think the captain's
sleeping with her.

217
00:11:47,417 --> 00:11:49,375
I think that's why
he sent for bizzy,

218
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,041
because anywhere bizzy goes,
Susan goes, too.

219
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,041
He invited his wife out

220
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:56,583
so that she would bring
his mistress?

221
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,875
That's my father.
And my mother trusts her.

222
00:11:58,917 --> 00:12:00,917
I mean,
she lives on the estate.

223
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,875
You know,
and now he does this? Ugh.

224
00:12:02,917 --> 00:12:05,417
I mean,
right under bizzy's nose.

225
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,291
And now they're here in
my house. Uh, I need a drink.

226
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,500
No, no, no, you don't.
Oh, I do.

227
00:12:10,542 --> 00:12:13,041
What you need to--you need to
tell those people to leave

228
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,458
instead of putting up
with their lies.

229

230
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:21,500
Sam, I can't tell the captain
and bizzy to leave.

And bizzy.

340
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:39,625
to have your heart broken,

341
00:18:39,667 --> 00:18:43,166
to... be lonely.

342
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:46,917
Is that how you feel now?
Okay, we're not talking about
me. We're talking about her.

343
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,917
Actually, we're not talking
about her.

344
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:51,709
We're talking about your father,
which is interesting.

345
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,291
You had
this traumatic experience

346
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,917
involving your mother--
it wasn't traumatic.

347
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:58,166
Okay.
You suck as a therapist.

348
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,625
Okay.

349
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:02,291
Why am I here?

350
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,917
I don't know why I'm here.
Why am I here?

351
00:19:04,959 --> 00:19:06,917
Uh, maybe because
I'm a stranger.

352
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:09,959
You can talk to me,
tell me... your feelings.

353
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,750
I'm neutral. I'm Switzerland.

354
00:19:12,792 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm just here to listen.

355
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,667
It wasn't traumatic.

356
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:29,375
Addison,
I'm here to help you...

357
00:19:29,417 --> 00:19:31,375
And to talk
and to let you talk,

358
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:34,750
but I'm not sure you're focusing
on the right things here.

359
00:19:34,792 --> 00:19:36,583
And I'm sure that I am.

360
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,792
Then why didn't you
get off the elevator

361
00:19:38,834 --> 00:19:42,041
when you saw your mother?

362
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:45,166
You might be right about
your mother and your father.

363
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,166
And far be it from me

364
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:49,208
to question
what should make you angry.

365
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:53,041
But... you haven't talked
to either one of them.

366
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,041
And your point is?

367
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:58,500
Well, maybe you need
to get off the elevator.

368
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:04,041
Are you sure it's okay
for her to have ice cream?

369
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,583
Yeah. Wouldn't hurt for you
to get some food, too.

370
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:08,583
I just want
to start over.

371
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,417
I just want to get as far away
from this day as possible.

372
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,834
Get her home,
not that we have a home.
Come stay with me.
My home is yours.

373
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:16,166
You know that.
As long as you need.
You guys, good news.

374
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,208
Betsey's neurological exam
is completely normal.

375
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,375
She shows no evidence of
any kind of ongoing problems.

376
00:20:21,417 --> 00:20:23,250
7 year olds
are resilient as hell.

377
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:25,875
So I would like to keep her
another day to monitor her,

378
00:20:25,917 --> 00:20:29,041
just as a precaution, but she's
officially out of the woods.

379
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:31,667
That is great,
which means you can eat.

380
00:20:31,709 --> 00:20:34,041
So I'm gonna go
to the cafeteria.

381
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:37,875
I'm gonna get you some food,
and no arguments.
Okay. Thank you.

382
00:20:37,917 --> 00:20:39,542
You're welcome.

383
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,041
Uh, w-where's my daughter?

384
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,959
She's with Dr. Wilder.

385
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,291
Betsey, I want you
to be prepared.

386
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:56,458
Your mom is all bandaged up
to keep her wounds clean.

387
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,333
So don't be scared, okay?

388
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,041
You ready?

389
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,208
Betsey.

390
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,625
Dell.

391
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:05,875
- Unh-unh!
- Betsey?

392
00:21:05,917 --> 00:21:07,041
Daddy!

393
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,458
Betsey.
Daddy!

394
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,458
Bring her back.

395
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,834
Oh, Mrs. Montgomery.

396
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,125
What are you doing here?

397
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:23,041
I'm waiting for Addison.
Addison is not here
this morning.

398
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,125
She actually, uh, went to--
she's here.

399
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:26,750
She knows I'm here.

400
00:21:26,792 --> 00:21:28,291
Oh.

401
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,333
Have you talked with her?

402
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,041
Not yet.

403
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,709
Have you?

404
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,083
No, no.

405
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,250
I have not talked with her.

406
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:39,792
Hey, Sam. I'm--I'm sorry
to interrupt.

407
00:21:39,834 --> 00:21:43,041
I'm gonna go back
to the hospital now.
Violet,
this is Addison's mother--

408
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,959
Mrs. Montgomery.

409
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,333
Hello.

410
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:50,375
I'm sorry.
I have to go now.

411
00:21:50,417 --> 00:21:53,083
And what do you do here at my
daughter's practice, Violet?

412
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:56,041
I-i--I'm a psychiatrist.

413
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,959
Interesting.
Yeah.

414
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,041
Have you met my husband--
the captain?

415
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:03,709
Um... I...

416
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,959
Yeah, uh, once or twice.

417
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Did you meet him once
or did you meet him twice?

418
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:13,500
Twice.

419
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:17,041
Yes, I believe twice.

420
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,709
I was hoping
we could do some shopping today

421
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,542
and then have lunch.

422
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:42,166
What are you doing?
What's going on?

423
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:44,750
Okay, that was a mistake.

424
00:22:44,792 --> 00:22:46,625
Mother, I'm just...

425
00:22:46,667 --> 00:22:48,750
I'm so sorry

426
00:22:48,792 --> 00:22:51,959
about what happened,
about what he did to you.

427
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,959
Who did what to me?
Look, I know, I know.
We don't talk.

428
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,959
We chat about, uh, flowers

429
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,041
and pretend that
he's not... cheating on you.

430
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:03,333
But let's not do that anymore.
Let's face it.

431
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:06,542
I'll face it with you.

432
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:08,542
You've gotta be lonely
and--and alone and--

433
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:11,291
Addison,
this is not your concern.

434
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:14,041
It's not my...
You're my mother.

435
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:15,667
Exactly.

436
00:23:15,709 --> 00:23:18,083
Let's not discuss
these things.

437
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:19,625
No, we have to.

438
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:25,041
You're wrong...
About your father.

439
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:28,208
I'm wrong. Bizzy, don't...

440
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:32,583
He drove you
to kiss another woman.

441
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:39,000
Susan... has been with me
for 20 years.

442
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:40,375
Yes, I know.

443
00:23:40,417 --> 00:23:43,542
She's worked with us for ages,
which is why it's--

444
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:48,125
Susan has been with me
for 20 years.

445
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:54,041
So, uh...

446
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:56,917
Shopping and then lunch?

447
00:23:56,959 --> 00:23:59,083
Mother...

448
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:01,417
Sit down.

449
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:17,709
There was one girl
in boarding school

450
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,500
when I was 14.

451
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:22,500
And then there was the one
in Switzerland on holiday

452
00:24:22,542 --> 00:24:25,041
when I was 17,
but those don't count.

453
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:28,583
It was cold,
and we were girls.

454
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:30,542
But...

455
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:34,333
Then I met Susan.

456
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:35,959
And the captain?

457
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
What about him?
Does he know?

458
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:40,125
We don't discuss it,

459
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:42,041
but, yes, he knows.

460
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:45,000
I think he's always known.

461
00:24:49,208 --> 00:24:52,000
Did you ever love him?

462
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:57,542
Oh, my... bizzy,
why did you marry him?

463
00:24:57,583 --> 00:25:00,041
We're from Connecticut.

464
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,583
My father
is a Bradford Forbes.

465
00:25:02,625 --> 00:25:05,750
Okay, so...
Let me get this straight.

466
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:08,500
You were the cheating whore,
not dad?

467
00:25:08,542 --> 00:25:10,041
I'm gonna go.

468
00:25:10,083 --> 00:25:12,041
If you're gonna talk like that,
I'll go.

469
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:14,959
You have no idea
how difficult it was.

470
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,917
Oh, come on, bizzy.
How hard could it have been?

471
00:25:17,959 --> 00:25:19,917
I mean,
nothing was expected of you.

472
00:25:19,959 --> 00:25:21,917
All you had to was
order the housekeeper around,

473
00:25:21,959 --> 00:25:23,333
run your charities

474
00:25:23,375 --> 00:25:26,041
and screw your husband
every Wednesday night.

475
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:29,041
How complicated is that?

476
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:30,625
You have no idea.

477
00:25:30,667 --> 00:25:32,750
You don't know me.

478
00:25:32,792 --> 00:25:35,041
You don't know me.
You don't know anything.

479
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:37,667
You don't know
one single thing about me.

480
00:25:37,709 --> 00:25:39,667
I could have done things.

481
00:25:39,709 --> 00:25:42,041
I could have... been things.

482
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:44,875
But I'm a Forbes.

483
00:25:44,917 --> 00:25:48,041
So I got married because that
was what I was supposed to do.

484
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:51,041
And I chose your father
because he asked

485
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:53,041
and he was nice

486
00:25:53,083 --> 00:25:56,458
and he seemed like
he wouldn't suffocate me.

487
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:01,041
And by the time I realized
my mistake, I had children.

488
00:26:01,083 --> 00:26:03,792
So I made a life.

489
00:26:03,834 --> 00:26:06,667
I did what I could
with what I had.

490
00:26:06,709 --> 00:26:09,667
And I may not have been
in love with your father,

491
00:26:09,709 --> 00:26:11,041
but I loved him.

492
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:13,250
I do love him.

493
00:26:13,291 --> 00:26:15,250
And I loved you
and your brother.

494
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:18,041
And so instead of doing
what I wanted to,

495
00:26:18,083 --> 00:26:22,041
which was run
or slit my wrists,

496
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:25,250
I threw birthday parties
and I smiled

497
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:27,500
and I kept my mouth shut.

498
00:26:27,542 --> 00:26:29,542
And I raised you
and your brother,

499
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:32,041
and you both
turned out brilliantly.

500
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:33,500
Susan was for me.

501
00:26:33,542 --> 00:26:36,500
Susan was the one thing
that was for me.

502
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:39,041
My children
took everything else.

503
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:42,834
And I'm sorry,
but until you have a child,

504
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:46,083
you have no idea
what it's like to be a mother.

505
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:48,041
You have no idea

506
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:51,875
the sacrifices a woman makes
when she has children.

507
00:26:51,917 --> 00:26:56,709
So don't you dare judge me.

508
00:27:03,917 --> 00:27:06,000
What the hell
were you thinking?

509
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:09,709
Naomi had to call me
to calm Dell down.
He can decide
whatever he wants for himself,

510
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:14,041
but that little girl
wants her mother.
That is not yours to say.
You made it worse and--

511
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:16,333
don't you dare lecture me
about making things worse.

512
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:19,500
- You don't get to lecture me.
- Dell... stop!

513
00:27:19,542 --> 00:27:21,750
Dell!

514
00:27:21,792 --> 00:27:23,917
You want to hit me? Fine.
Get off!

515
00:27:23,959 --> 00:27:25,917
But there's a woman in there
who you loved,

516
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:27,917
the mother of your child,
her child,

517
00:27:27,959 --> 00:27:29,917
who desperately
wants to see her.

518
00:27:29,959 --> 00:27:32,291
Yeah, you're pissed.
You have a right to be pissed.

519
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:34,291
But if you don't make peace
with this, Dell,

520
00:27:34,333 --> 00:27:36,333
if you don't make peace
with it now,

521
00:27:36,375 --> 00:27:39,792
you're never gonna get another
chance, and it will eat at you.
Get off!

522
00:27:39,834 --> 00:27:42,792
Dell, let Betsey see
her mother before she dies.
Stay away from me!

523
00:27:42,834 --> 00:27:45,750
Just stay the hell
away from my family!

524
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:50,917
You want to tell me
this isn't personal?
You know,
maybe you can condone

525
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:52,917
keeping a child
away from their mother,

526
00:27:52,959 --> 00:27:55,000
maybe that makes sense to you.
Not to me.

527
00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:56,375
Heather made a mistake,

528
00:27:56,417 --> 00:27:59,000
but if that child
doesn't get to say good-bye,

529
00:27:59,041 --> 00:28:01,667
you tell me what it does
to that kid.

530
00:28:31,792 --> 00:28:34,000
Drink before you speak.

531
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:41,625
She's very upset.

532
00:28:41,667 --> 00:28:44,667
Is she? I'm sorry.
That's so sad.

533
00:28:44,709 --> 00:28:46,750
Drink some more.

534
00:28:48,417 --> 00:28:50,875
Just give me
one good reason

535
00:28:50,917 --> 00:28:54,041
why my entire childhood
was a lie--one good reason.

536
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:56,667
We were trying to protect
you and Archer.

537
00:28:56,709 --> 00:28:59,041
Really? Because I'm a cheater,
Archer's a cheater.

538
00:28:59,083 --> 00:29:01,125
We're all
these awesome cheaters.

539
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:04,041
So, you know, that's a bunch
of crap--protecting us.

540
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:06,583
I want a good reason.

541
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:10,000
She's the love of my life.

542
00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:12,417
We've been married
for 40 years--

543
00:29:12,458 --> 00:29:14,875
40 years.

544
00:29:14,917 --> 00:29:18,875
My entire adult life,
she has been at my side.

545
00:29:18,917 --> 00:29:21,208
I love her.
She's my best friend.

546
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:25,875
She's my... everything.

547
00:29:25,917 --> 00:29:29,041
It's not her fault,
you know? She didn't know.

548
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:31,750
We didn't know.

549
00:29:31,792 --> 00:29:34,709
And when we did...

550
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:37,291
She's the love of my life.
It's complicated.

551
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:41,875
Love is complicated.

552
00:29:41,917 --> 00:29:44,625
Being a lesbian
is not a choice.

553
00:29:44,667 --> 00:29:46,959
She's not going to change
her mind.

554
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,041
Hell, she's practically screwing
Susan right under your nose.

555
00:29:50,083 --> 00:29:51,542
The mouth on you...

556
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:54,375
You know...
She sleeps with one woman.

557
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:56,458
I sleep with all the rest.
So what?!

558
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,458
And that's good enough
for you?

559
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,041
My entire life,

560
00:30:00,083 --> 00:30:03,000
I thought she was
this poor, pathetic woman.

561
00:30:03,041 --> 00:30:05,959
I thought it was my job
to cover for you.

562
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,959
And it made me hate you.

563
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,333
I mean,
don't you understand?

564
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:11,125
I hated the wrong parent.

565
00:30:11,166 --> 00:30:14,041
I--my cheating? I thought
I got it from you.

566
00:30:14,083 --> 00:30:17,041
But now I know that you're
the poor, pathetic one,

567
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:20,041
because you love her,
and she loves someone else.

568
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:21,667
But you stay.

569
00:30:21,709 --> 00:30:25,041
This is like some pathetic,
sad, afterschool special,

570
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:26,834
which is just awful,

571
00:30:26,875 --> 00:30:29,291
because now--
now I hate you both.

572
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:35,625
Eaglets.

573
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:38,834

I'm sorry.

It's okay.

621
00:32:53,083 --> 00:32:54,458
You people need to leave.

622
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,750
Leave this house.
Leave this city. Go home.

623
00:32:57,792 --> 00:33:01,041
Samuel, you have no right
to interfere in this.
It--it--it's okay.

624
00:33:01,083 --> 00:33:02,500
No, it is not okay.

625
00:33:02,542 --> 00:33:04,750
Addison is over at my house
right now,

626
00:33:04,792 --> 00:33:09,041
and I don't know what happened,
but you people did it.

627
00:33:09,083 --> 00:33:12,041
Sam. I don't think
I've seen you since you--

628
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:14,166
you were an awkward
med student.

629
00:33:14,208 --> 00:33:17,041
All due respect,
this isn't about you.

630
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:18,792
No, it's about them.

631
00:33:18,834 --> 00:33:20,917
It's their family.

632
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:24,083
I'm sure you care about Addison,
but so do I, so do they.

633
00:33:24,125 --> 00:33:27,542
They're not just gonna run out
because Addison is--is upset.

634
00:33:27,583 --> 00:33:31,166
And I will not let...
This destroy them.

635
00:33:31,208 --> 00:33:33,000
Well, she's my family, too.

636
00:33:33,041 --> 00:33:35,542
And I think I know her
better right now.

637
00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:38,166
So I'm not asking. I'm telling
you, you need to leave.

638
00:33:38,208 --> 00:33:40,583
Now if Addison wants to
make things right,

639
00:33:40,625 --> 00:33:43,041
then that's up to her.

640
00:33:43,083 --> 00:33:45,208
But you are not
going to push her.
Sam--

641
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,834
look...

642
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:51,625
If you care about Addison,

643
00:33:51,667 --> 00:33:54,417
and I believe that you do,

644
00:33:54,458 --> 00:33:57,000
leave.

645
00:33:58,458 --> 00:34:00,041
Come back to bed, Coop.

646
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:02,041
I gotta get back
to the hospital.

647
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:04,125
You shouldn't be embarrassed.

648
00:34:04,166 --> 00:34:06,417
Things have been
really stressful lately.

649
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:08,041
Dell's family--

650
00:34:08,083 --> 00:34:11,125
oh, is it time
for the sexology advice?

651
00:34:11,166 --> 00:34:14,125
"Impotence happens to all men.
It's usually just stress.

652
00:34:14,166 --> 00:34:17,166
Maybe we can cuddle instead."
Cooper...

653
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:19,792
You neglected to tell me
that you were married before.

654
00:34:19,834 --> 00:34:22,041
That's the problem.
Cooper--

655
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:24,083
oh, shut up, okay?

656
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:26,250
Shut up.

657
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:35,500
I hate you!

658
00:34:42,542 --> 00:34:44,500
She's just upset right now.

659
00:34:44,542 --> 00:34:46,500
Well, I'm upset, too, okay?
She hates me.

660
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:50,041
I'm--I'm not the one who
almost killed her, you know.

661
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:52,834
I'm tired, Violet.
I'm exhausted.

662
00:34:52,875 --> 00:34:55,208
I'm just trying
to protect her.
And you are protecting her.
I know that.

663
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,959
You're protecting her from
seeing something horrible.

664
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,208
But maybe you're protecting her
from the wrong things, Dell.

665
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:04,083
I mean, my life is a mess.
You know that.

666
00:35:04,125 --> 00:35:06,083
And--and you're--
you're probably right.

667
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:08,291
I don't always make
the best choices.

668
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:12,542
But, um, you know, I've
always made them with, uh...

669
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:17,041
With Lucas...

670
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:20,083
With Lucas in mind,
to protect him.

671
00:35:20,125 --> 00:35:23,083
And, you know, maybe I'm right,
but maybe...

672
00:35:23,125 --> 00:35:26,333
I-I just know that if Heather
could, she would take away

673
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:29,041
all the hurt that she has
caused you and Betsey,

674
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:32,041
every last bit of it, Dell.

675
00:35:32,083 --> 00:35:34,041
I found a pipe last night--

676
00:35:34,083 --> 00:35:37,375
last night--
and I confronted her about it.

677
00:35:37,417 --> 00:35:40,375
And she said it wasn't hers,
that she had a friend over.

678
00:35:40,417 --> 00:35:42,375
You know,
and I knew she was lying.

679
00:35:42,417 --> 00:35:44,375
I mean,
I knew she was lying.

680
00:35:44,417 --> 00:35:46,041
But I wanted and I needed

681
00:35:46,083 --> 00:35:48,333
to believe
that she wasn't using again,

682
00:35:48,375 --> 00:35:50,750
that she wouldn't do that
to me or to Betsey,

683
00:35:50,792 --> 00:35:53,125
that she loved us enough
to stay clean.
