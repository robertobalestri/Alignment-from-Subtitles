♪ Ohhh ohhh ohhh ♪

2
00:00:11,959 --> 00:00:13,917
Keep doing the exercises

3
00:00:13,959 --> 00:00:16,917
and take three
of the supplements a day.

4
00:00:16,959 --> 00:00:18,917
It really should help
your back.

5
00:00:18,959 --> 00:00:21,834
Yeah, I'm gonna be back
in the office today.

6
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:24,125
Okay, great. Bye.

7
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:27,125
You're going back to work?
Well, we talked about this.

8
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:30,250
It's been a month. You said
you were ready. But if--
oh, no, no. Right, right.

9
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:33,625
You're right. You're right.
You should go back to work.

10
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:36,041
Hey, I put down the new rug.
Oh, good.

11
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:39,041
Do you like it? 'Cause I can
get something else.
It's fine.

12
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:42,667
I just didn't know
if you'd like it.
It's fine. It's fine.
It's for covering blood.

13
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:45,583
It doesn't have to match
the drapes.

14
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:50,333
You want to hold him?

15
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:53,166
He's fed, changed
and burped--happy.

16
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:56,041
It's the perfect time.

17
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:58,041
Well, you--you've got him.

18
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:00,041
Violet--

19
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:05,041
Okay, breathe in and out.

20
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:07,583
Shh, shh, shh.
Remember what we said?

21
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,583
This time, you're just gonna
breathe in and out.

22
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:12,583
You're just gonna
stand there and wait. Shh.
I can't. I can't. I can't.

23
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:14,792
No--yes, you're just gonna
stand there and wait

24
00:01:14,834 --> 00:01:16,583
until I open the door.

25
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:18,667
- Breathe in and out.
- Do not go in--

26
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:21,041
The closet.

27
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:28,917
I told you,
don't ring the bell.

28
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:30,500
Oh, oh. Did I wake him?

29
00:01:30,542 --> 00:01:31,709
No.

30
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,834
She's in the closet again.

31
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:36,083
Don't worry. I'm handling it.
Yeah, no, no. I can--
I can see that.

32
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:39,709
Look, this really isn't
a good time.
Could I at least say hello
to Violet and the baby?

33
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,041
You know, since I might be
his father.

34
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:44,458
I'm sorry, but this really
isn't a good time.

35
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,041
Well--

36
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:50,875
That was Sheldon.

37
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:57,291
The rug is stained.

38
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:59,709
Well, better coffee
than blood, huh?

39
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,750
You know what?

40
00:02:01,792 --> 00:02:04,041
I'm not gonna go back
to work yet.

41
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:06,917
You're not ready.
You're looking at me
like I have crazy head.

42
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:09,125
And I don't. I don't have
crazy head. I'm fine.

43
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:12,041
Go back to work.
You haven't been out
of the house.

44
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:14,166
You don't answer the door.
I'm--I'm fine.

45
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:16,375
You never want
to hold the baby.

46
00:02:22,792 --> 00:02:24,917
Well, give me the baby.

47
00:02:26,792 --> 00:02:28,917
Pete, give me the baby.

48
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,291
All right, Pete, you--you--

49
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,291
you are
understandably concerned

50
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:44,041
because you're not sure
of what's going on,

51
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:46,041
so I'm gonna explain it
to you.

52
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,417
I am suffering from
panic attacks, sleeplessness,

53
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:51,083
agoraphobia and fear--all within
the windows of behavior

54
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:53,041
one expects
from trauma victims.

55
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,041
However i--I'm not
cognitively altered,

56
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:57,375
I am not utilizing unhealthy
outlets for my feelings,

57
00:02:57,417 --> 00:02:59,375
such as drugs
or inappropriate behaviors.

58
00:02:59,417 --> 00:03:01,375
I am aware of my condition

59
00:03:01,417 --> 00:03:05,083
and feel a normal amount
of concern for my well-being.

60
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:07,041
I display few signs
of improvement,

61
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:09,250
but--but I also display
no signs of disintegration.

62
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:12,041
I have the number
of two therapists,

63
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,458
the housekeeper is coming by,

64
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,041
and the baby can fit
in the closet with me.

65
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:18,125
More importantly,

66
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:20,125
I am a Harvard-educated
medical professional

67
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,125
with 14 years
of clinical experience

68
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:23,750
of trauma and depression.

69
00:03:23,792 --> 00:03:26,333
So believe me
when I am telling you

70
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:29,000
that I do not have
crazy head.

71
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:32,542
Now I'm holding the baby.
Go to work. We'll be fine.

72
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,583
Watch out...

73
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,792
Morning.

74
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:50,500
Morning.

75
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,625
Good shoes.

76
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:56,000
Thanks.

77
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,583
Yours, too.

78
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,000
Oh, can you...
Oh, yeah, yeah.

79
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,208
Press 4? Thanks.
How's it going there?

80
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,834
It's great.

81
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:07,834
It's really great.
I redecorated.

82
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,667
Oh. Good.

83
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:11,667
How's it going up there?

84
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,208
Fine.
Yeah?

85
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:18,333
Hey, what ever happened
with that guy?
What guy?

86
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:21,041
The--the heart guy.
The one you really liked,

87
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,041
but he was married
and his wife was your patient.

88
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,041
What was his name?
Noah.

89
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,750
Yeah, Noah. Noah.
What happened?

90
00:04:26,792 --> 00:04:28,125
You never told me.

91
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,500
Nothing. I, uh,
did the right thing.

92
00:04:30,542 --> 00:04:33,291
Good. That's--that's good.

93
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:37,291
Okay. Well...

94
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:41,542
I'll see you later.

95
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,041
Because, Sam, it is time.

96
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,667
Time for what?
 Cooper thinks we should hire a new doctor.

97
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:52,583
I think
it's time we move on.
I just don't want
to rush into anything.

98
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,333
When we find--
if we find someone,

99
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:58,709
I want it to be
the right person.
Addison, explain to the man that
married his college sweetheart

100
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,583
that the best way to get over
a breakup is to move fast,

101
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,750
throw yourself
into a relationship.

102
00:05:03,792 --> 00:05:05,792
I mean, drunken,
impulsive rebound hiring.

103
00:05:05,834 --> 00:05:08,250
Naomi is gone, man.
You gotta let it go.

104
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,458
What is wrong
with you two?

105
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,542
What?
We made a pact.

106
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:15,542
Addison and I
are ignoring our problems.
We are not going to talk

107
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:18,041
or think about
our problems anymore.

108
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:21,041
Nothing even close to thinking
or talking about our problems.

109
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,166
We're gonna be strong.
Strong.

110
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,208
In denial, but strong.
Strong.

111
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,834
Yeah, well, that's, um,
you know... stupid.

112
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:30,291
You need to talk about stuff.
 Really?

113
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,291
Mm-hmm.
Okay, well,
how's Violet, Coop?

114
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,709
Good.
She's good.
Is she?

115
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,625
Uh-huh.
Leave me alone.

116
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:39,291
I've sent stuff. I've sent
brownies and flowers

117
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,166
and some very thoughtfully
worded e-mails.

118
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,166
I will get to Violet's.
I'm giving her some space.

119
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:46,583
Oh, okay, you know what?
I gotta get to the E.R.

120
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:49,583
You two don't talk about me
while I'm gone, okay?

121
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,709
It's rude.

122
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:59,333
Oh, you waited for me.

123
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:02,125
I like dating
the chief of staff.

124
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:05,166
I get special service.
What do you got for me?

125
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:08,125
One of my patients put
a marble in his nose?
Not exactly.

126
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,041
11 year old's dad
threw her across the room,

127
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,041
probably broke her arm.

128
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,041
Mom looked like
she was in a prizefight.

129
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:17,041
Dad won the first round,
but mom threw the knockout.

130
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:20,166
Fun times.
Wait a minute.
The larsens? My larsens?

131
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:23,125
Tammy and her parents?

132
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:27,500
Page Sam... and Addison.
Michelle's pregnant.

133
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:33,041
Dad?

134
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,583
I stabbed him.

135
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:39,000
I stabbed my husband.

136
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:50,375
We're gonna get you
in a cast later.

137
00:06:50,417 --> 00:06:52,375
You can have
everybody sign it.

138
00:06:52,417 --> 00:06:55,875
You're just
gonna have to be prepared

139
00:06:55,917 --> 00:06:57,875
for a little bit
of itching, okay?

140
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,250
All right.
You want to talk about it?

141
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:02,500
No. I can't.

142
00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:05,041
All right. Okay.

143
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,041
I know it feels that way,

144
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,041
but, um,
you gotta believe me.

145
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:12,625
There's a lot of people
that want to help you.

146
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:15,834
Okay. Well, maybe later.
All right?

147
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,834
You still playing soccer?

148
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:20,458
Yeah. Starting fullback.

149
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,417
Oh, yeah? Starting fullback.
That's, uh...

150
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:26,250
Yeah, see, I don't know
anything about soccer.

151
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,750
You could ask me
about basketball.

152
00:07:28,792 --> 00:07:31,041
I'm good with the basketball.
Invented by a doctor,

153
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,750
probably to get
more patients,

154
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:34,792
'cause, you know,
basketball injuries.

155
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:37,083
Is my dad gonna be okay?

156
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:40,083
Dr. Bennett's taking care
of him. He's in good hands.

157
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:43,041
Okay, so crits are stable.
Fast scan is negative.

158
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,041
He's got some bruising
behind his left ear,

159
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:47,041
so we'll also need
a head C.T.

160
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,250
Thanks, man.

161
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:51,041
Sam...
It looks okay?

162
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,583
Uh, you've got a stab wound
to your abdomen.

163
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:56,041
If you ask me, you're lucky
that's all you got.

164
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:58,375
What about Tammy
and--and Michelle?

165
00:07:58,417 --> 00:08:00,041
Is the baby okay?

166
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,000
Oh, so you're worried
about them now?

167
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:06,041
A little bit late for that,
don't you think?

168
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:09,041
So he says, "she's not dead.
She's just

169
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:12,500
electroencephalographically
challenged."

170
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:14,750
So it looks like everybody
is settling in.

171
00:08:14,792 --> 00:08:16,291
Yes. Thank you,
Dr. Bennett.

172
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,959
It's good to be here.

173
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,959
Okay. Well, if you, uh,
need anything,

174
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,834
just let me know.

175
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,333
My door is always open.

176
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,500
Interesting dynamic.

177
00:08:28,834 --> 00:08:31,750
Even a group of top-notch,
Einstein-type professionals

178
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:33,750
feel the urge
to get out of the room

179
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:35,125
when the boss comes in.

180
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,125
Oh, well... they'll warm up

181
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:40,041
once we all get to know
each other.
Yeah.

182
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:43,125
So have you had the chance
to see Violet and Luke?

183
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:46,041
Pete's been telling me
it's a bad time, politely,

184
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:49,041
as he blocks the door
and refuses to let me pass.

185
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,041
H-Has he said anything
to you?

186
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:55,041
Um, they're... kinda
not talking to me up there.

187
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,041
But, uh, Addison and I
actually had

188
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,041
a real conversation
this morning,

189
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:03,041
so hopefully things will
get back to normal soon.

190
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,667
What?

191
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:06,125
Nothing, nothing.

192
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,125
It's just--well,
another interesting dynamic.

193
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:11,125
You being my new boss,
I'm hesitant to point out

194
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:14,166
that it... it might not
be that easy.

195
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:21,041
Heartbeat looks normal
for 10 weeks.

196
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,041
No evidence of bleeding
from the trauma.

197
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,208
So the baby's okay?

198
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,208
Looks fine.

199
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,291
Michelle, does this kind
of thing happen often,

200
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,083
Darren hitting Tammy,

201
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:33,083
hitting you?

202
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,458
It was an accident.

203
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,458
I want to see my daughter.

204
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,041
Michelle, look, I know
this is hard to talk about,

205
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:42,041
but you stabbed your husband.

206
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,041
Now if you were
protecting Tammy,

207
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,875
if this was self-defense--
god, you're making us
sound like...

208
00:09:47,917 --> 00:09:51,667
It was not like that.
Darren didn't do anything.
You don't
have to make excuses.

209
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:53,500
I was cooking...

210
00:09:53,542 --> 00:09:55,500
And Darren and I
started arguing.

211
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:57,750
Tammy tried to stop us,

212
00:09:57,792 --> 00:10:00,667
and she got in the way,
and Darren pushed her.

213
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:03,417
It was an accident,
but I got mad

214
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:07,125
and I overreacted
and I had a knife in my hand.

215
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:11,667
Please. I need to be with Tammy.
I need to make sure she's okay.
Okay, okay.

216
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:17,041
Michelle Larsen. We have
a warrant for your arrest.

217
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,625
What? No, no. No, officer.
Her husband hit her.

218
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:21,250
It was an accident.

219
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:24,041
Okay, Michelle. No, look, she
has a daughter who needs her.

220
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,125
She's pregnant.
She has a head contusion.

221
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:29,041
She needs medical care.
Then admit her upstairs
to the medical jail ward,

222
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,583
but her husband has a knife
wound, and she's under arrest.
Mom?

223
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,875
- Do not handcuff her in front of her daughter.
- What is happening?

224
00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:36,542
Tammy, it's okay.
She's traumatized enough.
Cooper, get her out of here.

225
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:37,875
No! I want to stay
with mom!
No, no, no. Tammy, Tammy--

226
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:40,041
everything's okay, sweetie.
I love you.
Mom!

227
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:42,000
I love you, sweetie.
I love you.
Tammy.

228
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,291
You want me to give up
a hospital bed

229
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:51,041
for a kid
with a broken arm?
She's 10 years old,
her dad hit her,

230
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:54,000
she just watched her mom
get hauled off by the cops.
All good material
for a country song,

231
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,041
but lousy
on a medical report.

232
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:58,041
You look like
day-old dishwater, Coop.

233
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,583
Why don't you go grab a shower,
get some rest?

234
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,500
You've done all you can here.
No, she's my patient,

235
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:04,500
and I should've known
what was going on.

236
00:11:04,542 --> 00:11:07,208
I could've stopped this.
When are you going to Violet's
to get your stuff?

237
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,208
Oh, Charlotte, come on.
Have you talked to her?

238
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,375
This is not about Violet,
okay?

239
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:14,083
I haven't shaved and my shirt's
a little wrinkled,

240
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:18,083
but beneath the depressed
hobo look, I am fine.
You're fine? You haven't seen
Violet since she got home.

241
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,083
You live with her
for six months,

242
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:23,166
now you won't even
pick up a clean shirt?

243
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:26,041
You won't talk about it.
Like you talk about
you getting fired?

244
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:29,333
I'm doing my job, Cooper--
the one I have left.

245
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:33,125
- My problems aren't getting in the way of that.
- I have a patient.

246
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,333
Echo is now
a grand old matriarch,

247
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,333
her crossed tusks
make her unmistakable.

248
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,542
Hello.
Violet, you're there.

249
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,250
Yeah. Well, that's how
the telephone works.

250
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,250
You call people.
They answer. You speak.

251
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:56,125
Right. Uh, look, I was just
calling to remind you

252
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,625
that if Lucas can't sleep,
give him the sheep toy.

253
00:11:58,667 --> 00:12:01,041
And he likes the rain sound,
but not the whale calls.

254
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:05,417
Uh, well, nobody likes
the whale calls. They're eerie.
You're checking up on me.

255
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,834
Yeah. I was hoping
you'd be out.

256
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:11,458
Well, Lucas is sleeping now,
so, uh, I better go.

257
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,166
You know what they say--
sleep while the baby sleeps.

258
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,166
The larsens?
My larsens?

259
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:24,208
Yeah. Well, my larsens now.

260
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,458
Well, when Michelle
came to me,

261
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,041
she and Darren wanted a sibling
so badly for Tammy.

262
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,041
When they finally got pregnant,
they seemed so--
so happy, I know.

263
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:37,041
Yeah.
Hey, listen, thanks for
coming with me today.

264
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,625
Yeah, well, you know,
I wanted to see Violet,

265
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:42,625
and this gives us
a chance to hang out.
Yeah.

266
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:45,625
Yeah. Things have been
a little awkward, you know?

267
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:47,625
Well, no.

268
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:49,709
It's just, uh...

269
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,667
It's nice to see you...
Outside of the office.

270
00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:54,041
Yeah.

271
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,875
Yeah.

272
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,917
No. Mnh-mnh.

273
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:04,041
Apparently...
There's a closet situation.

274
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,667
Violet.
Hey, it's me.

275
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:11,709
Uh, Nai and I are outside.

276
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,917
Okay.

277
00:13:18,417 --> 00:13:20,625
Hello?

278
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,041
Vi?

279
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,250
Could you--could you shut
the front door, please?

280
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,083
And--and lock it.

281
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:31,041
Both locks.

282
00:13:32,917 --> 00:13:34,792
It's closed and locked.
Okay.

283
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:38,542
Hey, you guys.

284
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:39,542
Hi.

285
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:42,041
It's so good
to see you. Hi.

286
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,625
Oh. Oh, my god,
you brought food. You're gods.

287
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:47,041
Hi.
Hi.

288
00:13:49,792 --> 00:13:51,083
Oh...

289
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,834
My god.

290
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,583
Hi.

291
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:59,917
Oh, look at these
tiny hands. Hi.

292
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:04,166
Oh, baby smell.
I love baby smell.

293
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,709
It's like heroin.

294
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:10,041
Aww.
Yes. This is making
my uterus hurt.

295
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,542
Oh.
Hello, sweetie.

296
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,041
Oh.
Hi.

297
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,208
Yeah.

298
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,333
He's adorable.

299
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:17,542
Yeah.

300
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,166
Hi, sweetie.

301
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:22,125
I get that you think
I'm a monster.

302
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:26,250
But the thing is, I swear, Sam,
it was an accident.

303
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:29,125
You get medical care from me.
You don't get sympathy.

304
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:32,041
I'm not looking for
your sympathy. I feel terrible.

305
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:34,375
It's not that.
I'm a good man.

306
00:14:34,417 --> 00:14:36,041
Stop talking.

307
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:39,333
You're a good man?

308
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:43,333
You like to hit women.
You like to hit children.

309
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,333
That doesn't make you good

310
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:48,375
and it sure as hell doesn't make
you a man, so stop talking.

311
00:14:48,417 --> 00:14:50,375
Okay, i'm--I'm a good man.

312
00:14:50,417 --> 00:14:53,375
And if you say one more word,
I might have to show you

313
00:14:53,417 --> 00:14:56,041
what this good man does
to people like you.

314
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,041
Dr. Bennett,
you might want to rein in

315
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,250
that charming bedside manner.

316
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,875
Trust me,
I was reining it in.

317
00:15:05,917 --> 00:15:07,250
He's seizing.

318
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:08,667
Darren?

319
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:11,917
I need suction
and an airway now.

320
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,000
Your incision
is healing well.

321
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:21,208
Just keep the area,
you know, clean and dry.
Okay.

322
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,542
Anything else?

323
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:26,542
No. Yes. Um...

324
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:30,041
You should probably get
some light exercise.

325
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,417
Just go walk around
the block or something.

326
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:35,041
You know, just get out.

327
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,542
Wow.

328
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,291
Your--your lips are moving,

329
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,291
but your words
sound just like Pete's.

330
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:44,125
You were in the closet,
Violet.

331
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,125
Look, i'm...

332
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,625
I'm doing
the best I can.

333
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:52,041
- No, I know you are. I do.
- Oh, look at that smile.

334
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,333
That's gas.

335
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,041
Sorry to tell you.

336
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:58,959
No, it is not gas.
This is a smile.

337
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,542
Yes, it is, 'cause you love
your auntie Nai, don't you?

338
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,041
Oh.

339
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,125
Oh, isn't he beautiful?

340
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:09,041
When Maya was little, I used
to just watch her breathe.

341
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,041
Isn't this the best?
Sure.

342
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,250
I am hogging the baby.
I'm sorry. Who wants him?

343
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:14,875
It's Addison's turn.

344
00:16:14,917 --> 00:16:16,542
Oh, go, go, go.
Yes.

345
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:19,041
But you're coming back
to me.
Hello, Lucas.

346
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,792
He did just smile.

347
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:23,000
He smiled.

348
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,917
Wow, this place
looks different.

349
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,375
Pete... I'm surprised
to see you here.

350
00:16:35,417 --> 00:16:37,375
Unless you're
my 2:15 appointment,

351
00:16:37,417 --> 00:16:39,000
in which case,

352
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,083
I'm glad you're finally dealing
with your kleptomania.

353
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,500
Well, that's funny.
You're a funny guy.

354
00:16:43,542 --> 00:16:45,917
Look, I need to talk to you
about Violet.

355
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:48,041
Are you sure
this is a good time?

356
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,041
Okay, I've been
a little overprotective.

357
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:53,291
You mean territorial.
Whatever psychological term
you want to use is fine.

358
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:56,041
I'm not here to argue
with you.
I told you when you
brought her home

359
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,500
from the hospital to her home,
that was a mistake.

360
00:16:58,542 --> 00:17:01,500
She wasn't ready
to face the trauma.
Going back to that house
is what Violet wanted.

361
00:17:01,542 --> 00:17:03,542
You try
telling her what to do.

362
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:06,458
I'd like to, but I haven't had
the chance. You're handling it.

363
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,583
I need your help.

364
00:17:11,417 --> 00:17:13,375
I'll stop by this afternoon.

365
00:17:13,417 --> 00:17:16,458
Thank you.
I was eyeing that apple.

366
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:31,417
The pressure in his brain
is still not coming down.

367
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,041
Continue the mannitol

368
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:36,166
and hyperventilate him
to a p.C.0.2 of 35.

369
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:40,208
Hey.
What happened?

370
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,208
Cerebral contusion.
He wouldn't stop seizing.

371
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,417
I had to induce
a barbiturate coma.

372
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:47,166
Neuro put
a pressure monitor in,

373
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:49,166
but I can't get
the pressure to come down.

374
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,792
So he may die?

375
00:17:50,834 --> 00:17:53,667
Yeah. Little bit of justice.
I'm just saying.

376
00:17:53,709 --> 00:17:56,792
Sam, if he dies...

377
00:17:56,834 --> 00:17:58,583
Michelle could be charged
with murder.

378
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,667
And what, Tammy has
a father who's dead

379
00:18:00,709 --> 00:18:02,583
and a mother in jail?

380
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:05,583
All right, well, now you're
just making me feel bad,

381
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,875
so stop it.

382
00:18:07,917 --> 00:18:09,959
Michelle, if you don't
tell the truth now,

383
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,333
you'll go to jail.

384
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:14,250
I am.
I just don't buy it.

385
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,500
You're still trying to
protect some image

386
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:19,041
that you have of your family
or of Darren.

387
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:20,625
It wasn't an accident,

388
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:22,625
and if he dies,

389
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:25,083
you will be charged
with manslaughter or worse.

390
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,083
You have to stop
protecting him,

391
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:30,041
if not for yourself,
then for your daughter.

392
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:32,291
Think about Tammy.
I am.

393
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,959
I am
thinking about my daughter.

394
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,709
Tammy, we have
some hard stuff...

395
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,667
To talk about.

396
00:18:44,709 --> 00:18:46,917
Your dad is in a coma.

397
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,041
From being stabbed?
He hit his head.

398
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,333
And Dr. Bennett's
taking care of him.

399
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,291
We're doing everything
that we can.

400
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,375
Look, I know
this is really hard

401
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:58,083
and I know you don't want
to talk about it,

402
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,250
and believe me,
I know what that's like.

403
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,583
But your mom's in trouble
with the police,

404
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:06,083
and I don't want her
to be in more trouble.

405
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,083
And this should not be
your responsibility,

406
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:10,917
but she says
that it's all her fault,

407
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:12,917
what happened, and...

408
00:19:12,959 --> 00:19:14,917
Well, I don't believe her.

409
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:19,750
And... if you told the police
what really happened...

410
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:23,834
Well...

411
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:27,041
I'm supposed to say
it was an accident.

412
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,333
But it wasn't?

413
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,709
No.

414
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,750
No.

415
00:19:33,792 --> 00:19:36,083
Tammy, look,
whatever your dad did--

416
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,041
it wasn't him.

417
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,208
I was cutting a cantaloupe,
and my dad came in.

418
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,500
He started singing
with the radio.

419
00:19:44,542 --> 00:19:46,041
He was being funny,

420
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:47,625
but I got so mad.

421
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:50,667
I don't know why.
It just comes over me.

422
00:19:50,709 --> 00:19:52,667
My dad could see
it was happening.

423
00:19:52,709 --> 00:19:55,959
He held me to calm me down,
but I bit him.

424
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,959
And he yelled for my mom,

425
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,333
and they both
tried to stop me.

426
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:04,667
I had the knife in my hand,
so I stabbed him.

427
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:10,333
And now he's gonna die.

428
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,000
I see
you have a new rug.

429
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:25,291
Pete tells me you're afraid
to leave the house.

430
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,500
I said that you could
come see the baby,

431
00:20:27,542 --> 00:20:31,083
not shrink my brain.
Your body language is telling me
that you're uncomfortable.

432
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,417
My vocal language is
telling you that I'm fine.

433
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:36,041
Really.
Could you be deflecting
right now?

434
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:39,625
Not very effectively.

435
00:20:39,667 --> 00:20:41,625
What do you want me
to say, Sheldon?

436
00:20:41,667 --> 00:20:45,083
I want you to talk about
how you're feeling.

437
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,709
Do you want to hold
the baby or not?

438
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,583
Yes.

439
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:52,875
I know what you're doing,
Violet. It's not gonna work.

440
00:20:52,917 --> 00:20:54,709
I'm not doing anything.

441
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,750
Look at this guy.

442
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:03,417
Do you mind watching him?

443
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:06,041
I could really use
a shower.

444
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,458
It's not gonna work,
Violet.

445
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,458
I'm a professional psychiatrist.

446
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,834
You're not gonna confuse me
with a baby.

447
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,959
And I think you have my ears.

448
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,667
I'm sorry about that.

449
00:21:20,709 --> 00:21:22,917
Yeah, I am.

450
00:21:22,959 --> 00:21:26,250
No. No, no. She told you?
No, no, she can't take

451
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,875
the blame for this, please.
Can you give us a moment,
please? Thank you.

452
00:21:28,917 --> 00:21:32,000
No, what are they
gonna do to her?
They're gonna try
to get her some help.

453
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,750
Don't you think we've tried?
Michelle, I understand
the urge to lie,

454
00:21:34,792 --> 00:21:37,750
to protect your family,
but we couldn't let you say

455
00:21:37,792 --> 00:21:40,750
that it was your fault
when it wasn't.
But it is.
It is my fault.

456
00:21:40,792 --> 00:21:42,959
I was on drugs
when I was pregnant with her,

457
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,917
for the first couple
of months,

458
00:21:44,959 --> 00:21:47,041
before I knew
I was carrying her.
Michelle--

459
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,583
you weren't there.
You don't know, but I know.

460
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:52,000
She had a.D.H.D.
Because of what I did,

461
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,875
and then these rages started.

462
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:55,959
She has them over nothing.

463
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,959
And someone told you
that her behavior

464
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,041
was related
to your drug use?

465
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,041
The school counselor said
that it's adolescence,

466
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:04,500
but I know what it is.

467
00:22:04,542 --> 00:22:08,083
I've read enough, and she's
been tested and tested and...

468
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:10,000
And there's nothing else.

469
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:12,208
It's me.

470
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,917
Michelle...

471
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:17,166
Look, I know
that you feel guilty

472
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:19,166
and that you feel hurt

473
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:22,166
and that you would do anything
to change what happened,

474
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,792
to change how you're feeling
right now.

475
00:22:24,834 --> 00:22:29,375
But sometimes... you just
have to push forward.

476
00:22:29,417 --> 00:22:33,000
Darren is the strong one.
I want to talk to him.

477
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:35,083
We've been through
all of this together,

478
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:37,542
and without him,
I can't do it. I can't.

479
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:40,041
He's in a coma,
and then...

480
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:43,583
Tammy's gonna be
taken away.

481
00:22:45,792 --> 00:22:48,750
I'm just losing
everyone I love.

482
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,959
We had a therapeutic
fencing match,

483
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,583
and I lost.

484
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:03,583
She distracted me
with the baby,

485
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:06,917
who is quite winning
and has my ears.
They're my ears.

486
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:10,583
What am I gonna do now?
Can I make an observation?

487
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:12,583
I don't know. Can you?

488
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:17,041
I know you're upset,
so I'm just gonna ignore that.

489
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:19,041
You told Violet
you were going to leave,

490
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:21,041
and you never did.

491
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:23,875
You know, you talk,
you send people over.

492
00:23:23,917 --> 00:23:25,250
Violet's smart.

493
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:28,041
She knows she doesn't
have to walk out that door

494
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:31,041
because you are always
gonna walk back in.

495
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:34,875
♪ You will never love
the way you know... ♪

496
00:23:34,917 --> 00:23:37,500
Definitely my ears.

497
00:23:37,542 --> 00:23:42,000
♪ You will never love
the way you show ♪

498
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:43,417
Hey.

499
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:46,041
There's a juvie officer here
that wants to take Tammy.

500
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:48,709
I need you to let me
keep her in the hospital

501
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,542
for another 48 hours.
You did not
just interrupt my dinner

502
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:55,041
to ask me to hide your patient
from the law?
Do you really think that
putting an 11-year-old girl

503
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:57,959
in jail
is the right thing to do?
She stabbed her father.

504
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,834
So let's help her. Let's not
throw her to the wolves

505
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:04,250
and just hope
they decide to raise her.
You're not social services.
You fixed her arm.

506
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:06,959
You did your job. Look, I feel
bad for the kid, too.
Do you?
Because I really can't tell,

507
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,041
because it's like

in a rage last night,

569
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:05,959
and her heart rate jumped
and her blood pressure spiked.
Uh-huh.

570
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,959
So I'm thinking--
so you're thinking
that it's more, um,

571
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,959
physiological
rather than psychological?
Yeah, but I
went through everything.

572
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,959
Uh, I was here all night,
went through everything.

573
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,333
Head C.T., tox screen--
yeah, they're both negative,

574
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:19,333
and the psych eval
is inconclusive.
Did you notice
if her pupils were dilated

575
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:22,583
when she got angry?
Yeah, yeah. It was like--
like she was on something

576
00:27:22,625 --> 00:27:25,583
or like there was some kind
of exaggerated fear response,

577
00:27:25,625 --> 00:27:27,125
but again, the C.T. scan...

578
00:27:27,166 --> 00:27:29,125
Hey, you okay?

579
00:27:29,166 --> 00:27:30,375

580
00:27:30,417 --> 00:27:32,000
Yeah, you seem sad.

581
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:34,041
Or you've seemed sad lately,
and I c--

582
00:27:34,083 --> 00:27:37,041

but I didn't--
I'm not.

583
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:39,792
I don't... I am sad.

584
00:27:39,834 --> 00:27:41,792
Okay.
But I can't talk about it.

585
00:27:41,834 --> 00:27:43,291
Okay. It's...

586
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:45,917

587
00:27:45,959 --> 00:27:47,291

00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:49,291

make sure I'm not crazy.

594
00:28:14,375 --> 00:28:17,750

you want to hold the baby?

595
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:20,375
Do I look like someone
who wants to hold a baby?

00:28:20,417 --> 00:28:22,542

No. No, I'm not.

00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:29,583

don't breast-feed.

600

602
00:28:33,583 --> 00:28:36,542

trying to make me feel

603
00:28:36,583 --> 00:28:39,041

isn't what I should feel,

604
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:40,542
if that makes any sense.

605
00:28:40,583 --> 00:28:43,083
No. No, Charlotte,
I'm not breast-feeding, okay?

606
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:45,709

is your business.

607
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:49,375
I only ask because you look
like you need a Martini,

608
00:28:49,417 --> 00:28:51,083

breast-feeding,

609
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:54,917

it's not your problem.

621
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:26,083

625
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:38,250
Yeah. I'm waiting on the results

I thought she was fine.

627
00:29:40,291 --> 00:29:42,667
No, for Tammy.

628
00:29:42,709 --> 00:29:45,500
Oh, but I thought that--

629
00:29:45,542 --> 00:29:48,208
Is everything okay?

630
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:52,250
I-I can't tell you everything
all the time, Nai.

631

645
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,583
Cooper apparently agrees.

646
00:30:37,625 --> 00:30:40,583

649
00:30:54,792 --> 00:30:56,792

650
00:30:56,834 --> 00:30:58,792

651
00:30:58,834 --> 00:31:00,875
He's the baby

652
00:31:00,917 --> 00:31:02,792
he's so perfect.

653
00:31:02,834 --> 00:31:07,625
And I-I look at him,
and I feel...

654
00:31:07,667 --> 00:31:09,834
Nothing.

655
00:31:09,875 --> 00:31:12,041
I can't...

656
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:14,542

657
00:31:14,583 --> 00:31:17,542
Ever since the...

658
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:21,041
I mean, there's this pressure
to be all "mommy,"

659
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:23,583

660

661
00:31:25,625 --> 00:31:28,583

I don't want to deal with him.

662

in the freezer.

663
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:33,166
Maybe thaw him out later

664
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:35,166
when I'm ready
to deal with him.

665
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:38,417
That's a--that's a horrible
thing to say, isn't it?
Yes.

666
00:31:38,458 --> 00:31:41,166
Oh.

667
00:31:41,208 --> 00:31:44,041
But the horrible things
they're...

668
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:48,041
Things that need to be said.

669
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:50,041
Can I ask you a question?

670
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:52,583
Shoot.
Where the hell is Cooper?

671
00:31:52,625 --> 00:31:55,583
He's busy saving a patient,

672
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:58,500
trying to make up for the fact
that he didn't save you.

673
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:00,875
What?

674
00:32:00,917 --> 00:32:04,041
Is he...
Blaming himself for--

675
00:32:04,083 --> 00:32:07,917
except for the part
he blames on me.

676
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:10,208
I called him that night.

677
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:14,000
I was the reason he didn't
walk in that door and save you.

678
00:32:25,667 --> 00:32:27,667
I guess you owe me.

679

00:32:33,083 --> 00:32:35,208
called an ectopic
pheochromocytoma.

681
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:38,542
It intermittently releases
an excess of adrenaline,

682
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:42,291
causing a rise in heart rate,
blood pressure,

683
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:47,458
all leading to fear, anger
and Tammy's sudden rages.

684
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,041
And, Michelle, nothing
that you did or do not do

685
00:32:50,083 --> 00:32:53,667
during pregnancy caused this.
But we found it,
which means we can fix it.

686
00:32:53,709 --> 00:32:56,875
Yeah, I can remove it
laparoscopically.
Without the need
for a large incision.

687
00:32:56,917 --> 00:32:59,792
Which means that all those moods
that you've been feeling,

688
00:32:59,834 --> 00:33:03,125
- they should stop.
- All this time, I've been blaming myself.

689
00:33:03,166 --> 00:33:05,250
I can't believe it.

690
00:33:05,291 --> 00:33:07,458
You're gonna be okay.

691
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,250
But dad isn't.

692
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:12,834
But you cannot feel guilty for
something you couldn't control.

693
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:14,834
But I do.

694
00:33:14,875 --> 00:33:17,709
And taking out this tumor,
it won't change that.

695
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:22,000
It won't change
the way I feel.

696
00:33:23,959 --> 00:33:26,917
I've tried steroids,
fluid restriction.

697
00:33:26,959 --> 00:33:29,041
Nothing's working.

698
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:31,041
Neuro says he's not
a surgical candidate.

699
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:33,500
I'm gonna take Tammy
into surgery now.
Okay.

700
00:33:33,542 --> 00:33:36,041
How's she doing?
She'll be fine.

701
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:38,917
Yeah, physically, but she
will not forgive herself,

702
00:33:38,959 --> 00:33:41,583
and nothing I said
was gonna get her...

703
00:33:41,625 --> 00:33:43,625
You guys think
that when we die,

704
00:33:43,667 --> 00:33:45,125
there's like a bookkeeper,

705
00:33:45,166 --> 00:33:47,125
and he tallies up
everything we did--

706
00:33:47,166 --> 00:33:49,625
all the lives we saved,
all the people we helped,

707
00:33:49,667 --> 00:33:52,750
and if we've done enough good
in the world,

708
00:33:52,792 --> 00:33:56,333
that it makes up for the times
that we just completely fail?
No. I don't think
anyone's keeping score.

709
00:33:56,375 --> 00:33:59,750
I think we do what we can,
we hope for the best,

and that's all
anybody can do, right?

we--we do what we can do

712
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:09,959
