00:00:03,291 --> 00:00:05,083
♪ Ohhh ohhh ohhh ♪

2
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:16,792
Oh, the--the range of movement
is amazing.

3
00:00:16,834 --> 00:00:18,917
You think that's good.
Hey, Pete.

4
00:00:18,959 --> 00:00:21,792
Go on. Toss it to Colin.
Come on. Don't be afraid
to put a little heat on it.

5
00:00:21,834 --> 00:00:24,041
I'm pretty good.

6
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:26,542
Nice catch.

7
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:29,542
I connected the arm directly
to Colin's nervous system.

8
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:32,625
The brain thinks "catch
the ball," and the hand does it.
The guys in my unit
would freak.

9
00:00:32,667 --> 00:00:34,792
Oh, were--were you
in Iraq?
Afghanistan.

10
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:36,041
Yeah.

11
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:38,375
Feel free
to use words

12
00:00:38,417 --> 00:00:40,834
like "genius"
or "brilliant" at will.

13
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:43,125
I don't have to
'cause you just did.

14
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:45,458
It was really nice
to meet you,

15
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,750
and, uh,
good luck with your arm.

16
00:00:47,792 --> 00:00:50,041
Ah.

17
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,000
You okay?
No, something--

18
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:55,625
oh, it burns.
Help him, or he's gonna
pull out the neuro connectors.

19
00:00:55,667 --> 00:00:56,875
Mm. Ah.

20
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:00,834
Ah.

21
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:03,166
You implanted a bolt
in his arm?
Osseous integration.

22
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:06,041
It's the only way
to carry the weight.
I know what it is.
It's also illegal.

23
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:09,000
In this country.
I sent him to Sweden.
Ah!

24
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:11,709
Ah! Mm.
Okay, it's infected.
He's burning up.

25
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,041
We've gotta get him
to the hospital.

26
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,709
Okay, well,
Maya's in your office.

27
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,625
She wouldn't even look at me
in the car on the way over here,

28
00:01:20,667 --> 00:01:23,709
and now you got Sam and Naomi
in the conference room.

29
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,208
Do you want to tell me
what's going on?
No, I can't, Dell.
I wish I could, but I can't.

30
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,208
Guys, um,
very pregnant woman

31
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,750
squatting up and down
in the hallway?
Not mine.

32
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:34,917
She's mine. Lynn McDonald. She's
committed to natural childbirth.

33
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:36,917
She's been in labor
for two days.

34
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:39,667
Her water finally broke
last night.
Ooh. This isn't working.

35
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:41,667
Do you have anything spicy
in the fridge?

36
00:01:41,709 --> 00:01:43,750
Like maybe--maybe
a Chimichanga, huh?

37
00:01:43,792 --> 00:01:46,834
That'll speed up
the labor, right?
Yeah, I'll order you something.

38
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:48,834
Yeah. Okay, baby, come out.

39
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:51,458
And come out.

40
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,500
And... come out.

41
00:01:53,542 --> 00:01:55,834
Well, let's go check out
your progress.
And come out.

42
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:59,959
Okay, Addison. What's this
important case that, uh...

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,667
Hey, Maya girl.
Hey.

44
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:04,500
What's up? Wait. Did you have
a half a day today?
No, no, no.

45
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:07,792
Was I supposed to--
no, no, no. I always keep
the half days in my calendar.

46
00:02:07,834 --> 00:02:11,000
I keep 'em
in my calendar, too.
It's not a half day.

47
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:14,500
Maya has something
that she needs to tell you.

48
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:21,959
I...

49
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:26,792
Um...

50
00:02:29,417 --> 00:02:31,917
I...

51
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:38,542
Maya's pregnant.

52
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:45,917
No, she's not.

53
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:47,792
How?

54
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,417
When did you start
having s--

55
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,834
wait. No. No, okay.
This is--this isn't possible.

56
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:55,500
We discussed this.
We discussed birth control.

57
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,208
Your--two doctors.

58
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,041
Both your parents are doctors.
How could you be pregnant?

59
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,792
How could this be happening?

60
00:03:01,834 --> 00:03:04,041
What were--
what were you thinking?

61
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,166
Hey, where you going?
Our daughter just told us

62
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:08,375
that--that--that
she is pregnant.

63
00:03:08,417 --> 00:03:10,375
We need to talk about this.
I can't.

64
00:03:10,417 --> 00:03:13,583
Mom--
Naomi, we are her parents.

65
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:16,417
I can't.

66
00:03:31,834 --> 00:03:34,041
Naomi walked away.

67
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:37,041
Our daughter is pregnant,
and Naomi walked away.
I know.

68
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:40,041
She's in shock.
She's dealing with it.
I'm supposed to just wait

69
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,166
until she decides
that she's ready?

70
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,875
We need to talk
to our daughter now.

71
00:03:44,917 --> 00:03:46,875
Sam, this isn't
the first time

72
00:03:46,917 --> 00:03:49,291
I've delivered
this kind of news.

73
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:53,041
People need time. Give...
Give Naomi some time.

74
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:55,041
Colin, you have
a severe infection.

75
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:56,875
How long
has it been hurting?

76
00:03:56,917 --> 00:04:00,917
A month. I thought
it was normal pain.

77
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,875
And I was afraid
that if it was the bolt,

78
00:04:03,917 --> 00:04:07,000
then I couldn't keep the arm.
Well, Dr. Wilder feels
the bolt should come out.

79
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:10,667
No. Can't we do
more antibiotics or something?
Well, what do you say,
Dr. Wilder?

80
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,667
You specialize
in infectious disease.

81
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:15,458
You know alternative treatments.
What are his options?

82
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,041
There has to be
something up your sleeve

83
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:21,250
since you have two of them.
There are
experimental protocols,

84
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:24,041
but the f.D.A. Hasn't completed
safety studies,

85
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,041
and there are reports
of severe side effects.

86
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:29,041
I'm sorry. The bolt is
the source of the infection,

87
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,125
and the safest thing to do
is remove it

88
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,625
before the infection spreads.

89
00:04:33,667 --> 00:04:36,208
Before I deployed,
I got engaged.

90
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,208
We wrote letters,
we planned the whole thing,

91
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,750
right down to the dance
that we're going to do,

92
00:04:40,792 --> 00:04:43,041
which requires me
to dip her to the floor.

93
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,959
Now I'm living up
to my part of this.

94
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm going to hold her
in my arms--both arms--

95
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,959
and I'm going to dance with her
the way I promised.

96
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,458
You came back alive.
You're healthy and alive.

97
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,458
I know you planned for more,
but I cannot treat you

98
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,291
in a way that will
jeopardize your health.
Dr. Wilder--

99
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:02,000
Colin, this infection
could kill you.

100
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:05,041
I know that's not
what your fiancée wants.

101
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:08,083
Why do they do this?

102
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,709
Why does the hospital
keep sending me samples?

103
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,583
It's like "gaslight,"
but with baby stuff.

104
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:17,875
"Gaslight"? Famous movie?

105
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:21,041
Never saw it.
Ingrid bergman.

106
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:24,041
Her husband
tries to drive her crazy.
Uh, when the petermans
get here,

107
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,208
will you put them
in exam room three?
I'm using exam room three.

108
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,959
Oh, actually room three
is for pediatrics.

109
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,875
And I have a 7 year old with
a urinary tract infection.

110
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:39,041
It's--it's about a marriage
that ends badly.

111
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,166
"Gaslight."

112
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,166
Marsha.

113
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,000
Hi. Violet Turner.

114
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:55,208
Uh, here's the situation--

115
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,458
I don't want
any more baby stuff.

116
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,333
So no diaper cream samples.

117
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,041
I've--I've called,
I've e-mailed,

118
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:05,000
I've mail-mailed
for the past six months,

119
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:07,625
but the hospital
just keeps sending it.
Most new mothers appreciate
our little freebies.

120
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:10,625
Well, I am not a new mother.
How old is your baby?

121
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:12,834
That's not what I meant.

122
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:15,875
I am not a new or an old
or any kind of mother.

123
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,125
I don't have a baby anymore.

124
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,041
Oh. Oh, my god.

125
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,041
I'm so sorry for your loss.

126
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,041
They're god's
littlest angels,

127
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,250
the ones we lose.

128
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:29,041
Could you just get
the form?

129
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,041
Of course.

130
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:34,417
I'm sorry, too,
for your loss.

131
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:36,417
Oh, no, no. It's just--
I-I was just--

132
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,834
no, no, no. You don't
have to explain. I-I get it.

133
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:41,667
I-i--
I lost my wife today.

134
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:43,041
Oh, my god.

135
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:46,041
A sentence you never think
you're gonna have to say,

136
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:49,041
you know, "I lost--
I lost my wife."

137
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,041
And, uh, every time
you say it,

138
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,166
you think you're not gonna
be able to breathe,

139
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,917
and it's like--it's like
somebody shot you or something.

140
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,917
And then i--and then I hear

141
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,041
that you lost your child--
your baby--and it's--

142
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:02,125
it, like, gives it
perspective, you know?

143
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:05,125
It--it's--it's--it helps me
to know you lost your child.

144
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:08,125
And I know that's
a horrible thing to say to you.

145
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:11,041
Um... my wife's dead,
and I've offended you,

146
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,041
and I'm sorry...

147
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,667
For your loss.

148
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:17,041
No, no. I'm--I'm sorry
for your loss.

149
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:20,291
They gave me this bag
with her... belongings.

150
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,041
It's...

151
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:24,041
It's funny.

152
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:27,041
I thought there'd be more
to take home.

153
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:30,041
Do you need...

154
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:33,125
Can I help you?
Is there anything I can do?

155
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,166
Uh, no. No, no.
I-I'm just waiting.

156
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,458
A friend's picking me up,
so...

157
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,041
Okay.

158
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,500
Well...

159
00:07:41,542 --> 00:07:43,500
It was nice to meet you.

160
00:07:43,542 --> 00:07:45,458
I'm Nathan pilsman.

161
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,041
Violet Turner.

162
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,041
It's nice to meet you,
Violet Turner.

163
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,375
Well, not nice,
but... it's nice.

164
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:03,083
You can't walk.

165
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,250
You're black.
What game are we playing?

166
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:08,750
The day
that you found out...

167
00:08:08,792 --> 00:08:11,583
When they told you that,
uh, your legs--

168
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,959
that you would--you would
never walk again,

169
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,625
that must have been
the worst day of your life.

170
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:19,500
How did you deal with it?

171
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:22,834
Why would you assume that
that was my worst day?

172
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,625
Losing my legs
changed my life,

173
00:08:25,667 --> 00:08:28,083
but, uh, it certainly
didn't ruin it.

174
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,333
There's a period
of adjustment,

175
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:34,041
but... you deal with it.

176
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:36,834
You're full of crap.

177
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:54,792
Naomi, what--what are you
doing here?

178
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,041
Mom, what are you doing?

179
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,750
What's going on?

180
00:09:00,792 --> 00:09:02,917
Naomi,
what is going on?

181
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,667
I need you to give Maya
an abortion.
What?

182
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:10,000
Nai.
Mom, no.
I don't want an abortion.

183
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:12,834
I don't care what you want.
But, mom--

184
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,667
give her an abortion.

185
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,041
I can't believe
I slapped her.

186
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:21,667
I hit my child.

187
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:23,208
You were upset, clearly.

188
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,250
It's not an easy thing
to deal with.

189
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:29,041
I know, I know, but I...
Well, I can't--i lost it.

190
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,792
But c-can you believe her?

191
00:09:31,834 --> 00:09:36,291
Can you believe her
saying no to me?

192
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,000
What?

193
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,000
You ordered her
to have an abortion.

194
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:43,000
So putting aside the fact that
you are personally against it--

195
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:46,041
you can't make someone
have an abortion, Nai.

196
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:49,709
No, no, no. This is--this--this
is not up for discussion.

197
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,709
I think it needs to be.
Well, you know what? If you're
not gonna do it, that's fine.

198
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:56,291
I will find another doctor
who will.
Okay, I don't even know
who I'm talking to right now.

199
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:59,041
This is not you.
It's the opposite of you.

200
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,667
You--you give people babies,

201
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:03,959
and whether or not I agree
with your stand on this issue,

202
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,917
this isn't you.
Don't do something now that you
will hate yourself for later.

203
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:11,083
Do you hate yourself
for your abortions?

204
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:12,917
Either of you?

205
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,083
No, I don't hate myself.
But I do think about it.

206
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:19,083
It stays with you even if you
do it for the right reasons,

207
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:22,250
and it is not a casual decision
that you can make for Maya.

208
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:26,041
This--this is my family.
You do not judge my family!

209
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,750
We're not judging.
You know that.
Look, this has hit you hard,

210
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:31,291
and that can make you change
what you believe--
stop it. Stop it.

211
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,291
Stop acting
like you understand,

212
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,750
because you don't.

213
00:10:34,792 --> 00:10:36,750
You don't.
This is my child.

214
00:10:36,792 --> 00:10:39,792
This is my child we are
talking about, my child...

215
00:10:39,834 --> 00:10:42,875
Who I've done everything in
my power to raise and protect.

216
00:10:42,917 --> 00:10:44,875
And now she's gone
and done something stupid--

217
00:10:44,917 --> 00:10:46,875
stupid--
that's gonna ruin her life,

218
00:10:46,917 --> 00:10:48,875
and I'm not
gonna let that happen.

219
00:10:48,917 --> 00:10:51,709
I am her mother.
I am her mother.
Naomi--

220
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,000
you have no right. You have
no moral high ground.

221
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,834
You walked away
from your child.

222
00:10:56,875 --> 00:11:00,000
If you can live with that,
I can live with this.

223
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:04,041
She's just upset. You--

224
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,709
I know.

225
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:09,041
Uh,
I know this is a bad time,

226
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:12,041
but my patient--i-i could
really use your help.

227
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:15,041
Yes. Please.
Tell me she needs surgery.

228
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,208
That I can do.

229
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,834
Oh, don't need your help
opening a door.

230
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,375
You're not very good
at taking help, are you?

231
00:11:27,417 --> 00:11:29,875
Oh, actually, I am. Your idea
about experimental protocols?

232
00:11:29,917 --> 00:11:31,458
I contacted my friend

233
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,041
at the f.D.A.,
got the info, went with it.

234
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:37,041
You're not taking out
Colin's bolt?
You might be afraid to take
a risk, but I'm not.

235
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,000
I assumed
Naomi brought you in

236
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,625
because you were
just as cutting-edge

237
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,333
as everyone else around here.

238
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:45,041
I didn't realize you were
the safe alternative.

239
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,041
All right, you know what?
You--hey. Hey. Hey.

240
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:50,041
You can't just say something
like that and roll away.

241
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:52,750
Can't hear you
over the noise of my chair.

242
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:54,875
Hey, Pete.

243
00:11:54,917 --> 00:11:56,417
Maya is pregnant.

244
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:59,000
Sam needs to drink.
You in?

245
00:12:02,542 --> 00:12:04,083
Oh!

246
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,083
Uh, Lynn's in a lot of pain.

247
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,083
She shows no sign
of fetal distress,

248
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:11,250
but her labor
isn't progressing.
I thought
after my water broke...

249
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:14,250
Well, I can give you oxytocin
to speed up the labor

250
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:17,041
and something for the pain.
My birth plan says no drugs.

251
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,375
Lynn has a birth plan.

252
00:12:18,417 --> 00:12:20,250
Oh, many pages...

253
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,875
And small font.
Yeah.

254
00:12:22,917 --> 00:12:25,667
I want to experience
my child's birth.
Uh, Lynn--

255
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:27,208
I did my homework, okay?

256
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,875
I-I understand
that there are procedures

257
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,917
that, you know,
may become necessary,

258
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,083
but except in a case
of extreme emergency,

259
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:37,500
you know, I want to be given
the opportunity to accept or--

260
00:12:37,542 --> 00:12:38,959
or refuse any procedure.

261
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,959
And as long as the baby's okay,
all right,

262
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,458
I want to have
a natural childbirth.

263
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,709
So to get the labor going,
I'm willing to try walking

264
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:51,041
or castor oil
or nipple stimulation--

265
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:52,959
well, it's
a little more involved.

266
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,417
If you fail to progress
in your labor,

267
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:58,417
you might want to consider
a c-section.
No. No.

268
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:01,417
Lynn, look, I know
this can be disappointing--
I've been in screaming pain
for hours.

269
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:04,542
I'm not--I'm not worried
about being disappointed.

270
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,583
You know, I-I married
a great guy.

271
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,875
You know,
I wanted to have kids.

272
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:14,375
He wasn't ready... ever.

273
00:13:14,417 --> 00:13:18,041
And... when the divorce
was final,

274
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:21,041
I decided to let loose.

275
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,458
You know,
having a baby alone,

276
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,458
being pregnant by some guy
that I met at the Tequila bar,

277
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,458
is not every girl's dream,

278
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,542
but this is
what's happening, okay?

279
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,500
And I am having this baby.

280
00:13:32,542 --> 00:13:34,500
So is it too much to ask

281
00:13:34,542 --> 00:13:37,083
that one thing
goes according to plan?

282
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,041
Naomi has lost her mind.

283
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:47,041
I don't even know
who she was today.
Do you want Maya
to have an abortion?

284
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,500
Well, that's the point.

285
00:13:48,542 --> 00:13:51,500
I'm a guy. It's--
it's--it's not my choice.

286
00:13:51,542 --> 00:13:53,500
Well, right, but do you
want her to--

287
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:57,041
do i--i want her to not
be pregnant in the first place.

288
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,125
I want her
to never have had sex.

289
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:01,208
I want her to live in a world

290
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,041
where there are chastity belts
and convents

291
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:08,375
and little boys
by the name of dink don't exist.

292
00:14:08,417 --> 00:14:10,834
That--that's what I want.

293
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:13,041
So don't ask me
if I want...

294
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:16,083
My baby girl
to have an abortion.

295
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,792

00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:09,375
It's like they're asleep.
I can't wake them up.

339
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,000
What is it?
What's happening?

340
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,000
Uh, a side effect
of the antibiotics

341
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,750
is neurotoxicity--
nerve damage.

342
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:22,875
Is this what Dr. Wilder
was afraid of?

343
00:16:22,917 --> 00:16:26,542
No. I'm gonna lower the dosage
on the antibiotic.

344
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,750
That should lessen
the effect.

345
00:16:28,792 --> 00:16:30,750
We'll give it a shot.

346
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,041
Oh.

347
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,625
Oh, god.

348
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:46,583
Oh, god! Oh!

349
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,834
Oh! Oh!

350
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:52,875
Oh! G--oh!

351
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,166
This is how today
should've gone down.

352
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,667
When we found out that
our daughter was pregnant,

353
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:08,583
we should've cried
on each other's shoulders,

354
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:11,583
we should've listened to what
our daughter had to say,

355
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,041
and then the two of us,

356
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:16,041
together, should have
discussed how to handle this.

357
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,792
That's not what happened.

358
00:17:17,834 --> 00:17:20,041
Talk to me.
Deal with this.

359
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,667
I don't want to talk about it.

360
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:26,041
And I am dealing with it.

361
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,667
Maybe not the way
you want me to, but...

362
00:17:28,709 --> 00:17:31,000
It's the only way I can.

363
00:17:37,834 --> 00:17:41,000
I'll do it.

364
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:43,166
I'll have the abortion.

365
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,041
Her.

366
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:58,917
Oh, yeah. That's grief.

367
00:17:58,959 --> 00:18:01,041
Definitely.

368
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,834
Dead husband? Dead kid?

369
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,792
It's dead kid.

370
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,041
It's her face.

371
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:10,959
She's got dead kid face...
Like you.

372
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,625
I'm sorry. That didn't
come out right.

373
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:15,625
No, it's okay.
It's all right.

374
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:17,834
What do you mean
about my face?

375
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,333
It's your eyes.

376
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,333
You--you've been someplace

377
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,333
that most people
have never been.

378
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:24,834
You've survived something

379
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,834
that no one would have
wanted to survive.

380
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,875
It's your eyes. It's...

381
00:18:28,917 --> 00:18:31,834
They're, I don't know,
empty.

382
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,834
Well, I mean,
that could be just...

383
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,834
Doesn't have to be
dead kid.

384
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,834
It could just be...

385
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,333
Bad life.

386
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:44,667
No, it's dead kid
or dead something.

387
00:18:44,709 --> 00:18:47,041
What about me?

388
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,333
Your face?

389
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:51,000
I mean,
I know you don't know me,

390
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,000
but do I look different?

391
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:57,625
You look like
you're in shock, Nathan.

392
00:18:59,417 --> 00:19:02,125
You look like
something bad happened.

393
00:19:06,917 --> 00:19:09,583
It's really nice of you
to sit here, you know,

394
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,583
but you don't--
you don't have to stay.

395
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,583
I'm sure that you have
someplace to be.

396
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:17,500
Uh... no, actually.
I don't.

397
00:19:17,542 --> 00:19:19,959
Okay.

398
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Okay.

399
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:28,041
Sorry.

400
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,542
I thought you'd be
at the gym.

401
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:33,041
I just came to get
the rest of my stuff.

402
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,417
Yeah, well, okay.

403
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:39,542
I bought the latex jumpsuit.

404
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:42,000
For me.
You bought it for me.

405
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,959
What, are you gonna have
some other woman wear it?

406
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,417
Well, so should I
give it to you

407
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,750
so you could wear it
for some other guy?

408
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:53,041
Cooper, we can do this.
We liked each other once.

409
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,834
Actually, we didn't.

410
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:57,000
We disliked each other,
and then we had sex,

411
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,000
and then we fell in love.

412
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:02,041
We never liked each other.

413
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:05,000
I guess you're right.

414
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:08,333
I think you should leave
the practice.

415
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,333
What?
I'll take out a loan.
I'll sell my car.

416
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:14,750
I'll do whatever it takes
to buy you out.
No.

417
00:20:14,792 --> 00:20:16,750
No?
No. I'm building a business.

418
00:20:16,792 --> 00:20:19,041
I don't care
if you were there first.

419
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:22,375
I belong there just as much as
you do. I'm not going anywhere.

420
00:20:22,417 --> 00:20:25,041
Useless, stupid love.

421
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,208
What?

422
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,041
Useless, stupid love!

423
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,000
Wasted time.

424
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:33,041
Just take your latex jumpsuit.
Find another woman.

425
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:36,041
Have a blast with it!
Oh, I c--
I will! I can't wait.

426
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:38,792
That's my towel you're wearing.
I want it back.

427
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,667
Oh, god! Oh, god!

428
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:44,250
You're doing great, Lynn.

429
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:47,041
Yeah. I feel great.

430
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:50,041
Uh, we--we could change
the music.

431
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,709
We haven't listened to
"chirping birds" yet.

432
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,709
I just wanted this
to be beautiful, you know?

433
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,083
All my books said

434
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:59,041
that the way a child
comes into the world

435
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:00,500
shapes them for life.

436
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:03,500
I just want to give him
the best chance

437
00:21:03,542 --> 00:21:05,500
that he can have, you know?
Mm-hmm.

438
00:21:05,542 --> 00:21:07,500
I-I don't want to shape him

439
00:21:07,542 --> 00:21:11,709
to be some angry
or--or scared...

440
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,083
Damn it.

441
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:14,917
Oh.

442
00:21:14,959 --> 00:21:18,125
I want him to have
a good life.

443
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,959
Okay, look... no matter
how today works out,

444
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,709
even if you decide
you can't take the pain,

445
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,041
you're still gonna have
plenty of opportunities

446
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:27,959
to shape your child's life.

447
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
So can I give you something
to help with the pain?

448
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:34,041
No. Just give me
the chirping birds.
Okay.

449
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:36,250
Yeah.

450
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:41,041
How many have you done?

451
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:45,041
More than I can count.

452
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:46,792
And they've all...

453
00:21:46,834 --> 00:21:48,041
They've turned out...

454
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:50,041
Well, "fine"
isn't the word I'd use,

455
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,458
but without complications.

456
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,291
My daughter's having
an abortion tomorrow.

457
00:21:56,333 --> 00:22:01,000
That in and of itself
is a complication.

458
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:04,625
Sam, is it weird
that it's me... doing it?

459
00:22:04,667 --> 00:22:06,625
No.
Would you prefer
that I get a--

460
00:22:06,667 --> 00:22:10,041
I'd understand if--
no, you do it.

461
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:13,041
You do it the best you have
ever done anything.

462
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,709
Do it like your life
depends on it.

463
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,166
It's Maya.

464
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:25,041
Oh. Oh. Ugh.

465
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:26,417
Colin, what happened?

466
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:29,041
Something's wrong.
I-I told 'em to call you. I--

467
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:31,041
I know you wanted to take
the bolt out.

468
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:34,125
You told me the antibiotics
were too risky, but I w--
this isn't even
the right dosage.

469
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:36,625
Dr. Fife lowered it. He--
it was--

470
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:39,000
he said
it was damaging my nerves

471
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:42,333
and he said that his arm
wouldn't work and--ohh.

472
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:45,041
Damn it.
The infection is spreading.

473
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:47,750
Get me a central line kit.

474
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:55,959
You have got to get
that bolt out.
I'll take it under advisement.

475
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,959
You--it--
this is his life,

476
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,458
and you are so concerned
with your invention.

477
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,834
It's what Colin wanted.

478
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:03,375
It's what you sold him.

479
00:23:03,417 --> 00:23:05,375
Naomi was right about you.

480
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:06,834
You're full of crap.

481
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:10,041
You don't want to fix his arm.
You want to fix your legs.

482
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:12,041
No. I already tried,
and I can't.

483
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:15,083
Okay, is that supposed to
make me feel sorry for you?

484
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:18,083
I'm not doing this for me.
I've accepted what I lost

485
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:21,166
and I'll accept it for Colin
as well, but not yet.
You just don't want to see it.

486
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:24,000
Maybe, and maybe there is
something out there

487
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:26,000
that we haven't
thought of yet.

488
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:29,041
Look, I'm not good at asking
for help, but I'm asking.

489
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:32,000
My patient wants to pick up
his life were it left off.

490
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:34,000
It may not be
what you would choose,

491
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:36,041
but it's what he chooses.

492
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:37,834
So do it for him.

493
00:23:51,542 --> 00:23:54,291
You did not just see that.

494
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:57,041
Isn't that what you
were wearing yesterday?

495
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:59,291
Uh, yeah. Just...
Helping out a friend.

496
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:02,542
Want me to loan you
something?
Did you move
all your stuff in here?

497
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:04,917
I sold my place.

498
00:24:04,959 --> 00:24:08,041
I know.
It was a rookie mistake.

499
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:11,125
Giving it all up for a guy,
moving into Cooper's apartment,

500
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:13,125
moving into the practice
where he worked.

501
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:16,125
I changed my life
to be with him.

502
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:18,500
I went all-in on forever.

503
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:21,000
Does Cooper know that?
No point now.

504
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:22,542
He wants me out.

505
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:25,792
He wants to pretend we didn't
happen, that I don't exist.

506
00:24:25,834 --> 00:24:30,959
Well, he thinks that's gonna
make him feel better.

507
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,500
But it won't.

508
00:24:32,542 --> 00:24:34,959
It'll just make him feel...

509
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,083
