00:00:03,291 --> 00:00:05,083
♪ Ohhh ohhh ohhh ♪

2
00:00:07,625 --> 00:00:09,583
You know
what gets on my nerves?

3
00:00:09,625 --> 00:00:13,041
Hmm?
 This assertion that we are supposed to pair up,

4
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:15,542
you know, that we
have to be in couples.

5
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:18,041
And love, marriage--you know,
marriage was invented

6
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:20,041
as a financial transaction,

7
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:22,041
and it does not
make you whole.

8
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,417
Yeah, and a lot of marriages
end in divorce.

9
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,750
Yes, most marriages
end in divorce.

10
00:00:26,792 --> 00:00:28,750
I'm divorced.
You're divorced.

11
00:00:28,792 --> 00:00:30,375
Marriage is stupid.

12
00:00:30,417 --> 00:00:32,750
My life is mine.
Right?

13
00:00:32,792 --> 00:00:34,750
It's a good life.
Right.

14
00:00:34,792 --> 00:00:37,041
Last night
I stayed home with my cat.

15
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:38,583
We ordered Sushi

16
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:41,041
and learned about the kombai
tribes of new Guinea.

17
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,583
Mm. Good times.

18
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:46,000
Oh, I need sex, Sam,
like I need water.

19
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:47,375
I'm in a desert.

20
00:00:47,417 --> 00:00:49,375
And it's not actually
the sex that I miss,

21
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:51,375
which I would be
very grateful for,

22
00:00:51,417 --> 00:00:53,166
let's be clear about that.

23
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:56,166
It's just that feeling,
you know, of being alive.

24
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:59,166
I mean, the flutter
that you get in your stomach

25
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:02,166
when you first kiss someone
and--and your lips part

26
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:04,041
your tongues--
ugh! Stop!

27
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:06,667
Just stop.

28
00:01:06,709 --> 00:01:08,709
Oh, I gotta sit.

29
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:13,041
Ahh.

30
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:16,792
Okay, I need it, too, but if
you tell anybody, I s--

31
00:01:16,834 --> 00:01:19,000
I won't.

32
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:27,709
What if you had said yes?

33
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,834
Yes to what?
In med school
when I asked you out

34
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:32,208
and--right.

35
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,959
Sam.

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,417
What if you had said yes?
Well, I mean, I couldn't.
I mean, Nai was--

37
00:01:37,458 --> 00:01:39,083
is--was my best friend,

38
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:42,083
and she had
a huge crush on you.
I know,
and so I asked her out

39
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:45,083
and then we got married,
and then we got divorced.

40
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:48,625
Derek asked you out. You got
married and you got divorced.

41
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:52,208
So I'm asking you now...
What if you had said yes?

42
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:56,208
Do you think that
we would've had a shot

43
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,917
at--at making it?

44
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,333
Me and you?

45
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:03,250
Me and you.

46
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:05,041
Help me!

47
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,125
Help me!

48
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:09,041
Over here.

49
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:13,083
What happened?

50
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:16,041
My wife...
All right, pulse
and respiratory rate are rapid.

51
00:02:17,542 --> 00:02:20,750
I have no signal
this deep in the canyon.
Okay.

52
00:02:20,792 --> 00:02:24,041
Use mine. All right,
tender on the right side.

53
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:26,250
He's losing a lot of blood.
My wife...

54
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:30,500
We're gonna call her
just as soon as we can, sir.
No. Our car crashed.

55
00:02:30,542 --> 00:02:33,542
I tried to get--get help.

56
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:36,625
Kara, she--
she's over there.

57
00:02:36,667 --> 00:02:39,041
Help my--help my wife.

58
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:07,375
Oh, thank god you came.

59
00:03:07,417 --> 00:03:10,041
Kara, my name's Addison.
I'm a doctor.

60
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:11,667
Where does it hurt?
Everywhere.

61
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:13,834
And--and we're stuck.

62
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:16,417
Can you--could you
get us out?

63
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:19,417
Where's--where's Jake? Did they
get him to the hospital?

64
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:21,417
Jake's with my friend Sam.
He's a doctor.

65
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:24,625
Uh, let's try to get you
out of this car, okay?
I can't. My a--

66
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:27,041
arm is stuck.

67
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,041
Okay. C-Can you--
can you feel your fingers?

68
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:36,041
I could--i could yes-yesterday.
Now they're--they're tingly.

69
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,875
I'm worried about the baby.

70
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:39,875
You've been here
since yesterday?

71
00:03:39,917 --> 00:03:43,041
Yeah, it was getting dark
when we crashed,

72
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,875
and Jake left before sunset.

73
00:03:44,917 --> 00:03:47,041
When he didn't come back,
I was afraid.

74
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,041
Thank god he made it out.

75
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:53,041
We found him about
50 feet up on the hill.

76
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:56,250
He was out there...
All night?

77
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:59,834
But... I thought you were here
to get me out.

78
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:02,250
It's just you and--
it's just you and your friend?

79
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:05,792
Okay, Kara--
You can't--
you can't get me out.

80
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:09,041
Kara, listen to me. Jake is
alive. Sam is helping him.

81
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:12,834
But I need
to check the baby. Okay?
Okay.

82
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,875
Now when's your due date?

83
00:04:14,917 --> 00:04:18,709
- Um...
- Today.

84
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,667
I'm due today.

85
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,917
Oh, uh, yeah. Hey, guys.
We close early on Saturdays.

86
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,917
Brendon got married
today, dude.

87
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:40,750
- Mazel tov, Brendon.
- Mazel tov!

88
00:04:40,792 --> 00:04:42,750
You know, you can't drink
in here, you guys.

89
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:44,917
You, uh... hey, your
wedding day's a big day.

90
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:48,041
You might not want to be
so drunk that you forget it.

91
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:51,125
I'm not drunk.
I have a problem.

92
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,959
It's my wedding night,
and Melissa and I,

93
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,041
tonight will be
the... first time.
Okay.
You're--you're virgins?

94
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,917
We figured it was important
to make the first time,

95
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:01,917
you know, special.
That's sweet.

96
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:05,041
Uh... I'm sorry.
Did you need something?

97
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,041
Well, I didn't want
to take a chance,

98
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:10,083
so I took these pills
right after we said "I do."

99
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,709
I was hoping they would
kick in by tonight,

100
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,709
and they did.

101
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:19,083
But it's--it's been up
for, like, three hours.

102
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,500
And my mother-in-law
tried to hug me--
oh. Oh.

103
00:05:21,542 --> 00:05:24,333
Okay, okay.
How many did you take?

104
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:27,375
Four, maybe five.

105
00:05:27,417 --> 00:05:28,583
Mm-hmm.

106
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:31,041
This is the sexology place,
right?

107
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,041
She's dehydrated. I'm afraid
of vascular collapse.

108
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,542
The baby's okay?
She says
she can feel movement,

109
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:38,041
but I can't angle in
to hear the fetal heartbeat.

110
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,041
I mean, there could be
a placental abruption.

111
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:43,000
I-I-I don't know.
How's he doing?
Broken rib, he's got
a deep gash to his thigh,

112
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,959
bleeding internally--he's bad.
I gotta get help fast.

113
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,959
You think you can
get outta here before dark?
If I run, maybe.

114
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,166
I mean, it took us
three hours to get in.
All right, I'll just go
back and forth between 'em,

115
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:56,208
try to keep them both stable
until you come back with help.

116
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,041
All right, I'll put
a pressure dressing on him

117
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:02,875
so he doesn't bleed out,
then I'll go.
Okay. Go fast, Sam.

118
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:08,125
Whoo.
Hello.

119
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:11,125
Which one of you
has the erection?

120
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:14,041
Priapism's no joke, fellas.
If I don't get that mast down,

121
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:17,208
this boat might never
sail again.
Well, you wanna walk
my plank, captain?

122
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,041
Hey.

123
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,417
What's your name?

124
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:21,834
Dan.

125
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,834
Well, Dan, let me tell you

126
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:26,041
the procedure
for reversing priapism.

127
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,041
First I take
a long-Gauge needle,

128
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,667
and I push it down
the head of the penis,

129
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:33,667
then I slowly draw out blood,
flush it with saline and repeat.

130
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:36,500
Still the man, Dan?
Now who has the erection?

131
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,417
Nice to meet you.
Follow me.

132
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:45,250
Aah! Oh, god.
Okay. Sorry. Sorry, man.

133
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:47,667
It's okay, it's okay.

134
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:51,041
As long as you're taking care
of Kara, it's okay.
Well, you both survived
a really horrible crash.

135
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:54,041
- The baby seems okay.
- I thought I could make it out.

136
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,792
I thought I could do it,
you know?

137
00:06:56,834 --> 00:07:00,375
All right. Addison will be back
to check up on you.

138
00:07:00,417 --> 00:07:02,208
What's wrong? What's wrong?

139
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,041
I-I can't breathe.

140
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:08,667
Damn it. You've got
a collapsed lung.

141
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:10,542
Okay, um...

142
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:13,500
Okay, i'm...

143
00:07:13,542 --> 00:07:16,125
All right, I'm gonna have to
make an incision in your chest

144
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:18,542
to relieve
some of this pressure.

145
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:21,041
This is gonna hurt.
Here we go.
Aah!

146
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:34,041
Okay. Stay with me, Jake.

147
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,041
Stay with me Jake.

148
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,000
Jake!

149
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,667
You need to drop 'em,
Brendon.
I can't.

150
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:44,667
We're dealing with
a ticking clock here.

151
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:46,959
The longer you wait,
the greater the chance

152
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,458
of permanent vascular
and neurological damage.

153
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,250
Do you want your Johnson
to fall off?

154
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:55,291
No.
Well, he's a virgin,
and it's his wedding night.

155
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:58,041
What's that have to do
with anything?
I think standing in front of
Maria sharapova

156
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,083
with a pitched tent

157
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:03,250
is a little like
cheating on his bride.
That is the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

158
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:06,250
I'm a physician, and we have
a tennis court reserved.
Okay, what if--
what if I came in,

159
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,959
if I was there,
sort of like a chaperone?

160
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,834
For his penis?

161
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:14,041
Fine.
Just get his pants off.

162
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,041
Uh, Charlotte...

163
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:20,041
I think you might want to,
uh, change your clothes.

164
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,500
Does that hurt?

165
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:24,041
Mm. No.

166
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,709
This is my fault...

167
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,709
The crash.

168
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,709
A bee flew in the car,
and I grabbed Jake's arm.

169
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,041
I didn't mean to.
It was an accident.

170
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:36,125
Ah! That hurts.

171
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:38,709
That's your rib.
It's probably broken.

172
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,750
That ought to make delivery
really fun, huh?

173
00:08:40,792 --> 00:08:44,125
Mm. Well, my vote
is for a c-section

174
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:45,959
in a hospital.

175
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,041
I second that vote.

176
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:50,041
Jake wanted a home birth.

177
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,041
I told him that's fine

178
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:55,125
as long as the baby
come outta him.
Ooh.

179
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,667
Addison!

180
00:08:56,709 --> 00:08:58,041
What--what happened?

181
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,458
Almost.
Collapsed lung.

182
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,000
Easy.
Oh!

183
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,792
There we go, there we go.
I had to improvise a chest tube.

184
00:09:04,834 --> 00:09:07,792
He's stable, but we have to keep
opening the tube

185
00:09:07,834 --> 00:09:10,333
- every half an hour...
- Or he'll arrest.

186
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,333
I brought him here

187
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:16,041
so you could watch both of 'em.
What's happening? Jake!

188
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:19,709
Jake!
Tell her...
Tell her I'm okay, please.

189
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,041
He's okay, Kara.
Oh.

190
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,083
Sam, it's gonna be dark soon.
I-I know, I know.

191
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:26,041
We had a hard enough time
finding the trail

192
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,875
during the daylight.
Yeah, well, the car
came from somewhere.

193
00:09:28,917 --> 00:09:31,875
I'm--I'm gonna try to find
the road. I'll be fine.

194
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:33,458
All right.

195
00:09:37,834 --> 00:09:39,375
What's happening?

196
00:09:39,417 --> 00:09:42,041
Nothing. It's just,
uh, Jake's having--
aah!

197
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,917
Aah!

198
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:46,417
Hit the brakes!

199
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,917
Sam!

200
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:59,875
Did he drop his drawers?
Gowned and waiting.

201
00:09:59,917 --> 00:10:01,250
Thank you.

202
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:04,709
Oh! You scared me.
You scared me.

203
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,500
I thought everybody had left.
Charlotte and I had
a late walk-in.

204
00:10:07,542 --> 00:10:10,041
What are you doing here?
I had some work to do.

205
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:13,041
It's Saturday night.
Well, it's not like there's
a lot happening at home.

206
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:16,041
- True.
- What did you do to him?

207
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,125
It's not our fault.
Don't lie to me.

208
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:21,125
Have a beer.
I don't want a beer.

209
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:23,542
Okay, everybody just calm down.
No, no. Don't tell me
to calm down.

210
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:26,333
This was supposed to be
the best night of my life,

211
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,333
and they've ruined it.
My wedding reception

212
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,959
is going on right now,
and there is no groom!

213
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,041
You know, you seem
very upset right now.

214
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:36,041
Maybe we can go somewhere
and have a talk?
Is it true
about... his thing?

215
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:39,000
It's not funny!
It's my wedding night.

216
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:42,500
Come on. I'll--I'll
take you to your husband.

217
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:44,041
Addison!

218
00:10:50,834 --> 00:10:52,041
Addison!

219
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,500
I'm okay. Kara?

220
00:10:53,542 --> 00:10:55,625
Are you all right?
I'm still here.

221
00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:57,083
Are you okay?
Yes.

222
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,959
Is she okay?
Yeah.

223
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,500
Okay, okay. Um...
You're--you're bleeding.

224
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:03,041
What?

225
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,041
Oh, I hit my head.
All right.

226
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:08,709
It's nothing. I'm okay.
Let me
take a look at it.

227
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,166
I can't open the door.
What?

228
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:14,083
I can't open the door.
Here, Sam. Help me.

229
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:17,291
The rock is blocking
the door.
Help me!

230
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,834
Okay. Okay.

231
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:23,834
Look, can you get out
that window?

232
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,542
No.

233
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:30,000
Sam.

234
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:35,750
If you can't get out,

235
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:38,041
I can't leave.

236
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,333
Jake--his tubing--
it'll clog...

237
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:43,125
And he will die.
What?

238
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:45,875
Okay.
What is it?

239
00:11:45,917 --> 00:11:47,875
Nothing. All right?
The, uh... Kara...

240
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:49,875
Trying to
figure this out.

241
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,875
We're gonna have to, uh,

242
00:11:51,917 --> 00:11:53,875
probably gonna have to
stay here through--

243
00:11:53,917 --> 00:11:55,959
wait out the night.

244
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,583
What?

245
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:06,792
Bourbon, neat.

246
00:12:06,834 --> 00:12:08,792
Can I get you a drink?

247
00:12:08,834 --> 00:12:10,792
Thanks,
but I've got one coming.

248
00:12:10,834 --> 00:12:12,166
Sorry
that took so long.

249
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,792
That bartender
was a total...

250
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:17,041
Pete. What are you
doing here?

251
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,792
Having a drink.
No, I can see that.
Why are you here?

252
00:12:19,834 --> 00:12:23,000
Just like you,
trying to have a little fun.
Maybe I should go.

253
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,583
N-No, no. Wait.
Thanks for the drink,
Shelly.

254
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,583
♪♪♪

255
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,792
Shelly?
She came up with that
on her own.

256
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:31,875
Hope I didn't ruin
your game.

257
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,917
Don't worry about it.
I wasn't that interested.

258
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,667
So you trying out
the single life?
I am single.

259
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:40,458
Right. Right. Of course.
What's that
supposed to mean?

260
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,208
Nothing. Nothing.
You and Violet--

261
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,208
oh, okay, stop.
I am not going there.

262
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,625
Tonight is about good booze
and single women, period.

263
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:48,625
On the prowl, are you?
You know...

264
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:51,625
Trying to prove a point?
Sheldon,
it's a big bar. I--

265
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:54,250
okay, but look,
we're colleagues now.

266
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:57,250
Aside from that thing
that once came between us,

267
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,250
there's no reason
why we can't be friends.

268
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,333
Maybe we would've been
friends

269
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:04,250
if not for that thing
we won't talk about.

270
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,458
I doubt it.

271
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,875
You stuck a needle
in his--
it's okay, baby.
It didn't hurt.

272
00:13:09,917 --> 00:13:11,291
She froze it first.

273
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,792
And so our next option
is to insert a shunt

274
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:16,166
to redirect the blood flow.
A shunt?

275
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:17,792
That sounds big.

276
00:13:17,834 --> 00:13:19,792
It is,
but it's what I got.

277
00:13:19,834 --> 00:13:22,709
Otherwise I'll have to
deglove the penis.

278
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,667
Deglove?
I make a circular incision
around the glands,

279
00:13:25,709 --> 00:13:28,041
roll back the skin
and squeeze out the blood.

280
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,166
Oh, god!

281
00:13:58,417 --> 00:14:00,458
Feeling better?

282
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,750
Yeah, a little.

283
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:06,041
So... how long
have you been pregnant?

284
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:14,208
This wasn't
supposed to happen.

285
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,250
When we made
our virginity pledge,

286
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,333
everyone made fun of us,

287
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:21,041
said we were freaks.

288
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,000
But we liked being different.

289
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:26,000
It was our way of saying what
we had together was special.

290
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,041
Well, the fact that you
couldn't keep your promise

291
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,667
is understandable.
No, no, no.
You don't get it.

292
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:33,667
We--we made a pledge.
It's a big commitment.
One that's difficult to keep.

293
00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:36,333
Yeah, that's what Jenny said
at my bachelorette party.

294
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,959
Who--who's Jenny?

295
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,750
My sister.

296
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:41,959
She and her friends
were telling stories

297
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,333
about their first time,
how much it hurt.

298
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:49,375
They said I should just do it,
just get it over with.

299
00:14:49,417 --> 00:14:52,500
That way, it would be great
when I was with Brendon.

300
00:14:52,542 --> 00:14:54,417
It's not Brendon's?

301
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:57,083
I thought if the wedding night
were close enough,

302
00:14:57,125 --> 00:15:00,041
Brendon would think it was.
Is that the kind
of marriage you want,

303
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,917
a relationship based on a lie?

304
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:04,625
You're gonna
have to tell him.

305
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,041
Okay, uh,
I'm gonna go get Jake.

306
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,041
That way I can help you
and him.

307
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:14,208
Will he make it
through the night?

308
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,709
Mm.

309
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,834
W--

310
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,125
y-yes. If the--
if the tube holds, yeah.

311
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:24,041
Good. That's good.

312
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,834
Okay.
Addison... ooh.

313
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,709
It hurts.
Something hurts.

314
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,125
Oh.

315
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,750
I think I'm bleeding.

316
00:15:37,709 --> 00:15:40,041
Ah!
It's not blood.

317
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:43,041
Your water broke.
You're in labor.

318
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,875
Oh.

319
00:15:44,917 --> 00:15:47,000
Ohh.

320
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,291
Oh, you've played before.

321
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,291
I lived for a while
on an army post.

322
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,125
There wasn't much
to do at night

323
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,875
except go to the bar,
drink and play darts.
You were in the army?

324
00:15:57,917 --> 00:16:00,458
National guard. I was called up
as a reserve doctor

325
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,000
when we invaded Iraq.

326
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:03,375
See any action?

327
00:16:03,417 --> 00:16:05,375
Stationed
at a veteran's hospital

328
00:16:05,417 --> 00:16:06,959
in landsthul, Germany.

329
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,959
I saw some action in Bosnia--
doctors without borders.

330
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,959
Had some pretty close calls
in the field.

331
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,959
I'm sure burning sage
in a war zone's

332
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,959
quite dangerous.
Okay, is there something
you want to say

333
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,792
about the type of medicine
I practice?
I think I just did.

334
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:23,250
Oh, look. You lose.

335
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,959
Let's go again.
I'll take your money
all night.

336
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,041
♪ baby, just lose control ♪

337
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:30,041
♪ girl, you know
what I want ♪

338
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:33,417
Uh, hey. You're way out
of your league on this one.
Hey.

339
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,709
We'll see about that.

340
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,792
Vodka, no ice.
Thank you.

341
00:16:44,542 --> 00:16:46,041
What are you doing?

342
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:48,041
Well, I'm hoping
that Violet gets Melissa

343
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,500
to come clean with Brendon.

344
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:51,417
She's pregnant
by someone else.

345
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,291
And Violet is involved why?

346
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:57,041
Because Brendon needs to know.
Violet should mind
her own business.

347
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,959
Charlotte.

348
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,083
It was just--

349
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,125
good. This is good.

350
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,500
This is gonna be good.
This is gonna be really good.

351
00:17:06,542 --> 00:17:09,166
What do you think
you're doing?
Talking to a patient.

352
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:11,333
She's not your patient.
Excuse me?

353
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,041
She's my patient's wife.

354
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:15,959
He came in for a stuck penis
not a relationship-ectomy.
Charlotte--

355
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,208
no one asked us
to insert ourselves

356
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,625
in their personal life.
Melissa is upset.

357
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:23,542
I am helping her
to figure out what--
no, you are doing nothing.

358
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:26,041
Charlotte--
no one is saying anything
to anyone.

359
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,000
It's my patient
and my penis.

360
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,041
Something's wrong.

361
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:36,417
That's funny.
Everything's wrong.

362
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:39,083
The force of the impact
shifted the baby.

363
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,000
He's in a breech position.

364
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:43,208
Well, what does that mean?
Is he okay?

365
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,208
It means that his legs
are pointing down.

366
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,583
I-I can't deliver him in this
position without turning him.

367
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,291
Don't move. Hold still.

368
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:53,875
I'm gonna try to flip
the baby. It's gonna hurt.

369
00:17:53,917 --> 00:17:55,625
Okay.

370
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:58,291
Okay.

371
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,041
Ohh!

372
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,917
Oh-oh!

373
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:05,041
Ah!

374
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,417
Oh!

375
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:10,041
Stop.

376
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,083
Did it... did it work?

377
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,959
I'm sorry.
Addison.

378
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,917
How are you doing?

379
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:22,291
The baby...
It's a footling breech.

380
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:25,625
I can't move him,
and he's coming.
How long?

381
00:18:25,667 --> 00:18:27,417
Soon.

382
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:30,041
And even if I do manage
to turn him,

383
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:33,291
I don't know if I can deliver
in this position.
We can't wait
till sunrise.

384
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:36,000
I know. I'm afraid we're gonna
lose all three of them.

385
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,375
What are you doing
with my tackle box?

386
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,000
I'm trying to give you

387
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,000
as much time as possible
while I'm gone.

388
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,041
The tubing's loose.

389
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,041
If I can sew it into your skin,

390
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:59,000
it won't
get pulled out of place.
Which would kill me?

391
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:01,041
I think it'll give you
more time.

392
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,875
You promise me you'll,
uh, come back, right,

393
00:19:03,917 --> 00:19:05,583
and bring help for Kara?

394
00:19:07,417 --> 00:19:09,000
I promise.

395
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:12,000
Let's get it over with then,
so you can go.

396
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,375
Okay, everyone.

397
00:19:16,417 --> 00:19:18,000
Visiting hours are over.

398
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:19,625
Let's go, Melissa.

399
00:19:19,667 --> 00:19:22,834
I want her to stay.
That's fine with me.

400
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,792
Okay. I'll be outside
if you need me.
Will you stay?

401
00:19:25,834 --> 00:19:28,417
Please,
so I don't freak out.

402
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:31,417
Great. Party
in procedure room one.

403
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,041
I know this might sound
a little forward,

404
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:37,041
but I-I saw you
from over there,

405
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:40,041
and--and I think you are...
Stunning.

406
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,083
You have this
unstoppable sex appeal.

407
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:46,000
You know, you're--you're like
the Niagara Falls of sexy.

408
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:49,083
Wow. That was... terrible.

409
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,041
Horrific.

410
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,625
Well, uh, I'm Sheldon.
Dawn.

411
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:55,208
Can I buy you a drink, dawn?
I'd like that.

412
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,542
Um, a Margarita.
A beer and a Margarita,
please?

413
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,750
While you're at it, I'll take
a bourbon straight up.

414
00:19:59,792 --> 00:20:02,041
Thanks, Sheldon.
Oh, you two know each other?

415
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,041
We're colleagues.
Doctors, actually.

416
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:07,834
Well, I'm a doctor.
Sheldon's a shrink.
A psychiatrist,

417
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:10,667
which means I have medical
training and emotional depth.

418
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,959
I bet you're very easy
to talk to.
Oh, he is. It's kinda like
talking to your dad.

419
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,041
Gee. Look what time
it is, Pete.

420
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:19,542
Shouldn't you be getting home
to your baby?
Oh, you have a baby?

421
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,000
Yeah, I'm a single parent.
And at his age...

422
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,709
Oh, I-I got it.
I got it.

423
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,041
No, Sheldon. I've got it.
I got it.

424
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,083
Sheldon, put your money away.
I got it.

425
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:31,083
I'm gonna let you two
work this out. Excuse me.
If you insist.

426
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:34,250
Great. Thank you.

427
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:38,041
Bringing up Lucas...
Low blow.
You drew first blood.

428
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,667
If you can't stand
the heat, get--
see, that's the difference
between you and me.

429
00:20:40,709 --> 00:20:43,041
This isn't a game to me.
I actually like this girl.

430
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,041
I think she's nice and funny
and smart.

431
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,709
And you'd take her home
just to prove a point.

432
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,166
Excuse me?
Well, if I'm allowed
to use the name,

433
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:53,166
I think you're still in love
with Violet.
Well, you know what I think?
I think you're projecting.

434
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:55,208
You're the shrink,
but I think maybe it's you

435
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,208
who's still hung up on her.
I am a shrink,
and clinically speaking,

436
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,458
we would call
what you just said an evasion.

437
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,834
In layman's terms,
you're a liar. You love her.

438
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:07,208
And when she comes around,
you'll regret this.

439
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,208
♪ ...Coming back
for more ♪

440
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,667
♪ just like the last time ♪

441
00:21:11,709 --> 00:21:14,625
The shunt's almost in.
Just a few more minutes.

442
00:21:14,667 --> 00:21:18,041
This is our wedding night,
and I've ruined it for you.

443
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,875
Don't say that.

444
00:21:19,917 --> 00:21:22,875
If this doesn't work,
we'll never be able to do it.

445
00:21:22,917 --> 00:21:24,500
It's not your fault.

446
00:21:24,542 --> 00:21:26,500
I just wanted you to think

447
00:21:26,542 --> 00:21:29,041
that I was some kind
of rock star in bed.

448
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:33,041
I wanted you to think
I was worth waiting for.

449
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:36,041
There's something
I need to tell you.

450
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,291
Maybe now is not the time.
Now is definitely
not the time.

451
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,250
I'm pregnant.

452
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:43,083
Wh--but...
We had a pledge.

453
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:47,041
We agreed... wait. You--
you did it with someone else?!

454
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,458
I have a sharp instrument
inside you. If you ever want

455
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,000
to use it again,
I suggest you stop squirming.
How could you?!

456
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:54,583
She made a mistake.
This marriage is over.

457
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:59,000
Brendon, we can talk
about this but--
everyone get out now.

458
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:01,542
Okay. All right.
Okay, let's go.

459
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:13,041
Hey.

460
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:16,041
So I, uh...

461
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:19,750
I sewed the tube in.
Uh, he's exhausted but stable.

462
00:22:19,792 --> 00:22:21,417
Okay.

463
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:24,041
How's the labor?

464
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:26,041
It's progressing quickly.

465
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:29,375
Okay.

466
00:22:29,417 --> 00:22:32,750
Okay, don't fall
or get hurt

467
00:22:32,792 --> 00:22:38,041
or do anything that might
cause you to die in this canyon.

468
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:41,041
You have to come back.
Okay. All right.

469
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:43,875
Okay. Be careful.

470
00:22:43,917 --> 00:22:45,583
I will be careful.

471
00:23:12,667 --> 00:23:14,667
Aah!
I feel something!

472
00:23:14,709 --> 00:23:17,250
Oh, my god.
I feel something.

473
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:19,458
What is it?

474
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,458
It's nothing.

475
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,458
Tell me. Just tell me.

476
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,041
It's bad enough without you
not saying things.

477
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:30,208
The baby's foot--it's come out
through the cervix.

478
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,834
His foot?

479
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:34,041
Oh, no. I can't--
I can't deliver him like this.

480
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:36,041
He'll die.
He's not fully engaged,

481
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:39,041
so I need to push him back up
through the birth canal

482
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:41,500
and try to invert him
from the inside.

483
00:23:41,542 --> 00:23:45,291
What? Are you kidding me?!
It's bad, but you can
do this, Kara, okay?

484
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:47,750
Just take a deep breath.

485
00:23:47,792 --> 00:23:50,125
I'm gonna be right here
with you, all right?

486
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:53,125
And we're both just...
We're both just gonna breathe.

487
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:56,041
Take a deep breath.

488
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:58,041
- Okay, ready?
- Uh-huh.

489
00:23:58,083 --> 00:24:01,834
Aah! No, no!

490
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:04,125
No, I can't! I can't!

491
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:08,250
Stop! Stop! Ow! Stop it!

492
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:10,750
Stop.
Kara, Kara,
don't give up on me.

493
00:24:10,792 --> 00:24:13,834
I need you to try.
No, no, no, no.

494
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:16,250
You can do it, baby.
You can do it.

495
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:20,041
No, I can't.
Oh, yes, you can. You're
the most stubborn woman I know.

496
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:23,041
It's not too hard for you.
We can do this.

497
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:25,041
No, I don't want to.
Please.

498
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:26,709
Kara, listen to me.

499
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,709
You know how most times...

500
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:31,709
You're the one who's always
in charge of us, right?

501
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,917
You decide where we eat,

502
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:35,917
what color
the baby's room's gonna be,

503
00:24:35,959 --> 00:24:38,750
where we're gonna go
on vacation.

504
00:24:38,792 --> 00:24:40,750
And it works
'cause I trust you

505
00:24:40,792 --> 00:24:43,750
and I know you want
what's best for us.

506
00:24:43,792 --> 00:24:46,500
Well, now it's my turn.

507
00:24:46,542 --> 00:24:48,500
I'm the one who's in charge.

508
00:24:48,542 --> 00:24:51,583
I'm in charge of us,
and I say you can do this.

509
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:54,041
So you have to do this.

510
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:56,041
It's my turn, okay?

511
00:24:56,083 --> 00:24:59,959
I know what's best.
You have to trust me.

512
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,041
Kara... you have to do this.

513
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:06,000
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

514
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:08,041
Just do it.
All right?

515
00:25:08,083 --> 00:25:10,959
Let's try again.
Okay? You ready?

516
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,542
Uh-huh.
Okay, here we go.

517
00:25:12,583 --> 00:25:15,750
Okay. Aah!

518
00:25:15,792 --> 00:25:18,000
Come on.
Oh, god!

519
00:25:18,041 --> 00:25:20,000
Come on.
A little bit more. Almost.

520
00:25:20,041 --> 00:25:22,041
Ow! God!

521
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:23,250
Ow!

522
00:25:23,291 --> 00:25:25,041
Yes!

523
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:26,041
Oh!

524
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:29,041
Wh-what just--what happened?
Did she do it?

525
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:31,583
We did it!

526
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:36,792
I love you, Kara.

527
00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:38,792
Oh, I love you, too.

528
00:25:45,458 --> 00:25:48,458
Hey, Melissa's in my office
crying her eyes out.

529
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,458
She says she won't leave
until she talks to Brendon.

530
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:56,041
He doesn't
want to speak to her.
Well, you're gonna have to
get him to change his mind.

531
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:58,083
I get it.

532
00:25:58,125 --> 00:26:00,500
You're a meddler.
You like to meddle.

533
00:26:00,542 --> 00:26:02,166
Meddling makes you happy.

534
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:04,291
But when it comes
to my patients,

535
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:08,041
I'd prefer you stayed away.
Okay, we use a team approach
here, Charlotte.

536
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:10,417
That means we share advice
or suggestions

537
00:26:10,458 --> 00:26:12,667
or anything
that might help the patient.

538
00:26:12,709 --> 00:26:14,667
Brendon came here
for a case of priapism.

539
00:26:14,709 --> 00:26:16,709
Now look where he's at.
Yeah, well, look where
they're both at.

540
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:19,709
They start the day,
their whole lives ahead of them,

541
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:23,250
happiness within their reach,
and... then it's shattered.

542
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:26,542
And who shattered it, Violet?
Who got her to open her yap?

543
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,834
I think you're afraid.

544
00:26:30,875 --> 00:26:33,834
I think you're afraid of
getting to know your patients.

545
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:38,041
So you put on
the tough southern girl act,

546
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:41,125
because to feel
what they're feeling...

547
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:43,291
Well, that would mean
feeling something.

548
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:46,417
Is this the part where I
break out the kleenex

549
00:26:46,458 --> 00:26:49,709
because you think my heart's
darker than Texas coal?

550
00:26:53,375 --> 00:26:56,750
You know, our patients come here
for healing, Charlotte.

551
00:26:56,792 --> 00:26:59,458
So... whether that means
a pill

552
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,041
or a bandage or a needle
or a conversation,

553
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:03,667
it's the same.

554
00:27:03,709 --> 00:27:07,291
We listen, and when we can,
we respond.

555
00:27:07,333 --> 00:27:09,250
That's what we do here.

556
00:27:09,291 --> 00:27:11,917
No. It's what you do here.

557
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,583
So, uh...

558
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:21,583
You just gonna
stand there all night?

559
00:27:21,625 --> 00:27:23,583
Is there something else
I should be doing?

560
00:27:23,625 --> 00:27:25,041
I think it's customary

561
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:27,709
for the guy
to make the first move.

562
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,709
Oh, I get it.
This is the move.

563
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:32,709
You do nothing while you wait
for me to come to you.

564
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:36,125
Well, it worked, didn't it?
Your, uh, friend Sheldon,
he doesn't play any games.

565
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:40,041
His approach is straight up.
And yet, here you are
talking to me.

566
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:44,333

00:29:03,667 --> 00:29:05,041
'cause here we do that.

594
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:08,083
We tell you things,
and sometimes it helps you.

595

Oh, for the love...

596
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,417
Anyway, here's the thing
I want to tell you.

597
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:17,667
I was married...

598
00:29:17,709 --> 00:29:20,041
Once.

599
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:23,250
I married the first man
I truly loved.

600
00:29:23,291 --> 00:29:27,625
Thought we had this whole
fairy-tale thing going on.

601
00:29:27,667 --> 00:29:29,625
It was.

602
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:32,500
He was... amazing.

603
00:29:32,542 --> 00:29:36,250
We were amazing.

604
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:39,041
And then he did something...

605
00:29:39,083 --> 00:29:42,041
Something stupid
and thoughtless...

606
00:29:42,083 --> 00:29:43,750
Something mean...

607
00:29:43,792 --> 00:29:47,041
The kind of something
I was not willing to forgive.

608
00:29:47,083 --> 00:29:48,709
So I left him.

609
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,750
I left him behind
and I went on

610
00:29:50,792 --> 00:29:53,917
and I live
this whole other life now.

611
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,291
And it's good.

612
00:29:55,333 --> 00:29:56,917
It's fine.

613
00:29:56,959 --> 00:29:59,458
I have a great guy,
I'm a doctor.

614
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,000
My life is damn near perfect.

615
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:04,500
But every once in a while,

616
00:30:04,542 --> 00:30:06,917
I think about that guy

617
00:30:06,959 --> 00:30:08,917
and the fairy-tale thing
we had

618
00:30:08,959 --> 00:30:11,500
and... I wonder
if we'd still be amazing

619
00:30:11,542 --> 00:30:15,083
if we were together now.

620
00:30:15,125 --> 00:30:18,041
And I'll never know...

621
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:20,041
'Cause the minute it got hard,

622
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:23,125
the minute it stopped being
a fairy tale...

623
00:30:23,166 --> 00:30:24,792
I cut and ran.

624
00:30:24,834 --> 00:30:28,750
Real life is hard.
Real stuff takes work.

625
00:30:28,792 --> 00:30:33,041
Real life is sometimes
thoughtless and mean.

626
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:35,583
But that doesn't
cancel out the love.

627
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,542
So if you don't love
this girl,

628
00:30:38,583 --> 00:30:41,291
walk away.

629
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:43,417
But if you look at her

630
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:46,959
and you know she's the one...

631
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,667
You owe it to yourself
to give her a second chance.

632
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:57,792
Lift your butt then push.
No! I can't move.

633
00:30:57,834 --> 00:31:01,458
The baby can't come out, Kara,
until you push. Now lift.
You can do it.
You can do it, baby.

634
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,333
I can't!

635
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:05,208
Kara, look at me.

636
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:07,291
Kara, look at me.

637
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:09,375
All right, we are both
trapped in this car.

638
00:31:09,417 --> 00:31:11,375
We are both scared--
terrified--all right?

639
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:15,041
But you have a guy outside
this car who is waiting for you.

640
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:17,041
You have a guy who loves you.

641
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:20,041
Now if you don't do what I
tell you to do, you will die.

642
00:31:20,083 --> 00:31:21,542
You will die on him.

643
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:23,542
Now if I die,
nobody's really gonna care.

644
00:31:23,583 --> 00:31:26,041
W--they'll care,
but they won't be broken.

645
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:29,041
If you die, you will break him.
Jake will be broken.

646
00:31:29,083 --> 00:31:31,041
Someone loves you.

647
00:31:31,083 --> 00:31:33,417
So we're not gonna sit here
and debate this.

648
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:37,041
When I tell you to push, you are
damn well going to push! Right?

649
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:39,041
So push!

650
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:41,000
Push!

651
00:31:41,041 --> 00:31:43,417
Good. All right. Good.

652
00:31:43,458 --> 00:31:45,834
Baby's out. The baby's out.

653
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:48,041
How is he?

654
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:52,041
Is he okay?
Is he okay?

655
00:31:52,083 --> 00:31:55,625
Oh... no. He can't be...
You have to help him.

656
00:31:55,667 --> 00:31:59,083
You have to help him.

657
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,375
Help him.

658
00:32:01,417 --> 00:32:03,291
You have to help him.

659
00:32:05,083 --> 00:32:07,125
Ah!

660
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:15,041
He's okay?
Well, first of all,

661
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:17,041
someone missed something
on the ultrasound,

662
00:32:17,083 --> 00:32:20,083
because he is a she.

663
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:22,834
And, yes...

664
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:25,542
She's okay. Yes.

665
00:32:25,583 --> 00:32:27,041
Yes.

666
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:28,542

667
00:32:28,583 --> 00:32:30,250
She's so beautiful.

668
00:32:31,792 --> 00:32:34,625

Ten fingers, ten toes.

669
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:38,458

Is he moving?

681
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:18,542
Sam.

682
00:33:18,583 --> 00:33:20,041
Sam!

683
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,041
Get the repelling team!

684
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:40,834
Sam! We had the baby.
But Jake--how's Jake?

685
00:33:40,875 --> 00:33:43,792
Tell me he's alive.
Tell me!

686
00:33:43,834 --> 00:33:46,041
He's still alive!
Oh!

687
00:33:46,083 --> 00:33:47,458
E.M.T.'S almost there.

688
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,583
We're gonna have to
pull him up in the helicopter.

689
00:33:50,625 --> 00:33:52,583
All right,
give me a backboard,

690
00:33:52,625 --> 00:33:56,041
I.v. Of normal saline
and 0-2 on a rebreather.
You got it.

691
00:33:56,083 --> 00:33:59,041
Way to hang in there.
We're gonna get you outta here.

692
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:08,208
All right, you're gonna
be in good hands, man.

693
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:10,208
- Well done.
- Careful. Careful.

694
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:12,583
Listen, I don't want--
I don't want to go, okay?

695
00:34:12,625 --> 00:34:14,583
I don't want to go--
she's right behind you.

696
00:34:14,625 --> 00:34:17,709
I don't want to go
without Kara.
She's gonna catch up with you
at the hospital.

697
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:21,041
Take care of Kara. Promise me.
Yes, I got you.
Good job, buddy.

698
00:34:21,083 --> 00:34:22,917
One, two, three.

699
00:34:22,959 --> 00:34:24,208
Hey.

700
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:26,625
Hey. Sam.
So they're gonna
have you guys outta here

701
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:28,625
in a couple of minutes.
How is he?

702
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:31,458
He lost a lot of blood, but I
think he's gonna be okay.
And the baby?

703
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,458
- Paramedics have her on 0-2.
- She's nice and pink.

704
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,250
You guys did good.
All right,
door's coming off now.

705
00:34:37,291 --> 00:34:40,208
Yeah.
We need you to stand clear.

706
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:44,000
Thank you.
Just, uh, thank you.
Oh, no. You don't have to--

707
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:46,250
I do. And I swear,
when we get outta here,

708
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:49,875
I am naming that baby Addison.

709
00:34:49,917 --> 00:34:52,959
That's good. That's good.
I'm bringing 'em in.

710
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,333
All right.

711
00:34:56,083 --> 00:34:58,041
Aah!

712
00:34:58,083 --> 00:35:00,041
Stop! Stop! Stop!

713
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:02,208
Hold up! Hold up!

714
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:04,959
- Sam! She's crashing.
- She's losing blood!

715
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,875
The pressure from the door
must have tamponaded the wound.
Get me an I.V.!

716
00:35:08,917 --> 00:35:11,583
She's crashing!
She's crashing!

717
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:20,125
Brendon, I know
you're still angry.

718
00:35:20,166 --> 00:35:23,041
Damn right, I'm angry.
I'm pissed...

719
00:35:23,083 --> 00:35:25,333
And humiliated.

720
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:27,041
I'm so sorry.

721
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:29,583
I never wanted
to see you again.

722
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:32,750
But?

723
00:35:38,083 --> 00:35:40,083
But...

724
00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:44,667
I-I look at you, and...

725
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:46,834
I'm not ready
to w-walk away.

726
00:35:48,917 --> 00:35:50,542
I love you.

727
00:35:51,959 --> 00:35:53,291
Brendon.

728
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:55,291
Oh!

729
00:35:55,333 --> 00:35:57,959
Keep off it
for a couple days.

730
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:10,333
What just happened here?
Guess he didn't want
to give up on her.

731
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:13,166
Now that was a long night.
Who's up for some food?

732
00:36:13,208 --> 00:36:16,834
My treat.
I'll go get my stuff.

733
00:36:18,542 --> 00:36:20,500
So that was
a good thing you did,

734
00:36:20,542 --> 00:36:23,041
convincing Brendon
to give her another chance.

735
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:26,375
Is there any privacy
in this office?

736
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:29,125
Does Cooper know
you were married?

737
00:36:29,166 --> 00:36:32,417
I wasn't.

738
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:34,417
Brendon and Melissa
are back together.

739
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:37,166
They're happy. That's all
that matters, right?

740
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:39,625
W-Why don't I believe you?

741
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:42,375
Let it go, Violet.
Were you lying?

742
00:36:42,417 --> 00:36:44,542
You know,
it's not actually morning,

743
00:36:44,583 --> 00:36:46,542
but I think I'm having pancakes.

744
00:36:46,583 --> 00:36:49,583
Yeah, I'm having
banana pancakes.
You know what?
O-On second thought, I think,

745
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:53,458
uh, I-I got a lot of work
to finish up, so...

746
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:05,208
Charge the paddles.

747
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:08,875
You heard me.
Charge the paddles.

748
00:37:08,917 --> 00:37:11,041
Addison,
it's been 20 minutes.
No.

749
00:37:14,208 --> 00:37:16,500
She's gone.
