00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:12,000
Radio call said her purse was
still hanging off her shoulder.

3
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:13,542
They found some plastic

4
00:00:13,583 --> 00:00:15,542
and an appointment card
for Dr. Montgomery.

5
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:17,542
Oh, my god. Lauren.

6
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:20,333
Lauren, it's Dr. Montgomery.
Can you hear me?

7
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:22,959
22-year-old pregnant female,
near drowning.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,583
Apneic and hypothermic
at the scene.

9
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,583
She's my patient--
Lauren woods, 33 weeks.

10
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:28,583
Can you tell me what happened,
Lauren, anything?

11
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:31,041
Coast guard fished her
out of Santa Monica bay.

12
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:33,542
Did anybody see anything?
Already in the water
when she was spotted.

13
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:36,166
Michael? Where's Michael?
Hold on, Lauren.
Hang in there.

14
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,041
She's in v-tach.
Get her in trauma surgery two.

15
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,041
All right, sounds like
classic v.S.D. Consistent with

16
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:46,041
a large defect between
the right and left ventricles.

17
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:48,542
This is new?
Never there before.

18
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:50,208
The stress from the accident

19
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,041
probably blew
the underlying defect open.

20
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:56,041
Pulse ox is dropping.
Her lungs collapsed.
Needs a chest tube.

21
00:00:56,083 --> 00:01:00,375
I got it.
All right, put her under.
Prep for an emergency c-section.

22
00:01:00,417 --> 00:01:02,208
The baby's
in severe distress.

23
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:09,208
Pressure's dropping.

24
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,792
She's throwing
multiple p.V.C.S
she's back in v-tach.
Crash cart.

25
00:01:11,834 --> 00:01:14,458
Lost her pressure.
All right. V-fib.
Charge to 200.

26
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,625
Addison, we gotta get
that baby outta there.
Almost.

27
00:01:17,667 --> 00:01:20,500
She's in cardiac arrest.
Addison, now.

28
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:24,500
All right, clear.

29
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:37,208
Hey.

30
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,041
Hey.

31
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:42,542
I guess you're going to
the St. ambrose thing tonight?

32
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:45,083
No choice.
William white's being honored.

33
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:47,667
He writes my checks. You?

34
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:49,291
Oh, no.

35
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:52,709
I used to like parties,
but now...

36
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,041
I don't know.
The big crowd...

37
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:58,041
Guess that's all
part of the crazy, huh?

38
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:00,041
Avoiding dull speeches,

39
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:02,041
big egos
and drunken colleagues?

40
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:03,750
Maybe not so crazy.

41
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,583
Are you being nice to me?

42
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,041
Maybe.

43
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:14,709
A little.

44
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:18,291
Morning.

45
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,166
Morning.

46
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:25,166
Did you get a chance to look
at the data I e-mailed you

47
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:29,083
on my, uh,
human cloning project?

48
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:30,542
Human cloning.

49
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:33,041
I've decided it's time
to clone people.

50
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:36,000
Yeah, well,
I'm trying to work.
Which is all
you've been doing lately.

51
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:41,750
It's easier here
than at home.

52
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:46,583
Home is lonely,
and, uh... work is good.

53
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,041
You know, I could help...

54
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,750
With work mostly.

55
00:02:53,792 --> 00:02:56,750
The emotional stuff--
I'm a little crippled.

56
00:03:01,792 --> 00:03:03,375
Thank you.

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,375
Naomi.

58
00:03:06,417 --> 00:03:07,875
I, uh, I...

59
00:03:07,917 --> 00:03:10,750
Um... I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting?

60
00:03:10,792 --> 00:03:12,041
Oh...
Yes.

61
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:14,667
No. No,
we were just working.

62
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:18,041
I just wanted to say thank you
in advance, for tonight.

63
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,000
I really do appreciate it.

64
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,750
Well, I am honored,
really.

65
00:03:22,792 --> 00:03:24,542
Sucking up to the boss.

66
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,750
No, I am presenting William
with his award

67
00:03:26,792 --> 00:03:29,041
at the ball tonight.
You're coming, right?

68
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,625
- Got my dancing shoes on.
- Good. Good.

69
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,625
Anyway, I just, uh...

70
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:40,667
Wanted to express
my gratitude.

71
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:44,375
I'm sure your speech
will be tremendous,

72
00:03:44,417 --> 00:03:47,041
impressive as always.

73
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,291
How's Lauren?

74
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:10,041
Uh, she's sedated,
in I.C.U.

75
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,458
Echo showed a persistent
v.S.D. In her heart.

76
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,875
She needs surgery, and I can't
do that until she's stable.

77
00:04:15,917 --> 00:04:19,875
How's the baby?
Her lungs aren't mature enough.
She's having a hard time.

78
00:04:19,917 --> 00:04:22,959
You were good in there
this morning.

79
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,041
Did you get in contact
with her husband?

80
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,709
I tried.

81
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,667
Okay, well, I'm gonna go
check up on Lauren

82
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:33,333
and then go back
to the practice.

83
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:35,625
Sam.

84
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:38,625
Can we just...
Will you talk to me?

85
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:44,000
I'll keep you posted
on Lauren.

86
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:47,959
"No" is not an option.

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,041
Addison's memo said
everybody goes to the ball.

88
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:52,041
All right, well, I'm gonna
go ahead and pull

89
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,542
the "wife died,
single parent card," so...

90
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:57,333
I'm out.
Oh, I was attacked.

91
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,875
Oh!
You may have read about it?
Yeah, it kinda gives me

92
00:04:59,917 --> 00:05:02,875
carte blanche
to ignore all memos.
No, no, no, no. People, you
know, life happens, we move on.

93
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:04,875
We use big,
gaudy events like this

94
00:05:04,917 --> 00:05:06,875
to move on with our lives.

95
00:05:06,917 --> 00:05:09,500
Me? Broke up
with my girlfriend.

96
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:12,500
Yeah.
Small potatoes, maybe,

97
00:05:12,542 --> 00:05:15,917
but I'm really looking forward
to getting out there and...

98
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:19,583
And forgetting about
the past.

99
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,583
You ever gonna grow up?
Oh, I hope not.

100
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:24,542
I'm feeling so much younger
and freer lately.

101
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,417
Yes. Hey, can you tell
Dell and Violet

102
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:29,333
that this thing tonight
is a command performance?

103
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,750
Oh, it is. We all go.
We're gonna brush our teeth,

104
00:05:31,792 --> 00:05:34,166
we're gonna
put on expensive clothes,

105
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,166
we're gonna go
to this fancy party,

106
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,500
and we're gonna have fun.

107
00:05:38,542 --> 00:05:40,291
We're gonna have fun, okay?

108
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,625
Yeah, so...

109
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:45,542
See you there.

110
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,000
Hey, Sam.

111
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:54,125
Sam. Are you okay?

112
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,750
No, I'm not okay.

113
00:05:56,792 --> 00:05:58,750
I have no idea how to plan

114
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:00,792
a pregnant
15 year old's wedding.

115
00:06:00,834 --> 00:06:04,041
There's no guidebook.
I checked.
Well, it's a wedding.

116
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,875
It's not traditional, I know,

117
00:06:05,917 --> 00:06:08,542
but hopefully it's
the only one she'll have.

118
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:12,875
She--she just wants it
to be special.
No, what she wants
is a fairy tale.

119
00:06:12,917 --> 00:06:15,792
And to be honest, I'm not
feeling very happily ever after.

120
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:17,333
Well, find a balance.

121
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:20,041
You know,
nice but not too big,

122
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,375
everything tasteful,
elegant, but...

123
00:06:22,417 --> 00:06:25,667
Appropriate.

124
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:27,458
What?
You're hired.

125
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,792
No, Sam--
look, Maya's gonna come over.
She's gonna drop some stuff off.

126
00:06:30,834 --> 00:06:33,458
You take a look at it, tell me
if you think it's appropriate.

127
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,500
Could you? Pl--
oh, thank you.

128
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:37,083
Thank you.

129
00:06:39,542 --> 00:06:41,583
Paige...

130
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:44,417
Says you've had a fever
for a couple of days.

131
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:47,583
Doesn't seem to be affecting
your texting fingers.

132
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:50,792
That's good.
Sorry.

133
00:06:50,834 --> 00:06:53,792
How's the new school?
It sucked for a while,
eating alone every day.

134
00:06:53,834 --> 00:06:57,041
But I have a lot
of friends now, so it's good.

135
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,583
Good. Friends are good.

136
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,583
You definitely have a fever.

137
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:04,542
And you look...
A little yellowish.

138
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,709
Let's look
at your glands.

139
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,291
I just need
to take a look.

140
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,750
Okay.

141
00:07:10,792 --> 00:07:12,375
Okay.

142
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,250
Oh.

143
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,250
How'd you get that?

144
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:23,291
Um, I don't know. It w--
it was just there.

145
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,291
It looks like a bite.

146
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:28,500
You got a wild little brother
I don't know about?

147
00:07:28,542 --> 00:07:30,458
It was probably
my curling iron.

148
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,500
I've burnt myself
with it before.

149
00:07:33,542 --> 00:07:36,542
Paige,
did somebody bite you?

150
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:39,500
No. I'd know
if someone bit me.

151
00:07:45,792 --> 00:07:47,750
The nurse said
she's coming to?

152
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:49,750
In and out.
Her sats are low.

153
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:52,250
I was just adjusting
her oxygen.

154
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:55,458
Lauren. Hey.

155
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,458
Your baby was born.
It's a girl.

156
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,125
Her lungs are weak,
but she's hanging in there.

157
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:04,291
I'm still working on her,
okay?

158
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:07,834
The pressure--
I can't breathe.
Okay.

159
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,625
Hi, Lauren.
I'm Dr. Bennett.

160
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:11,583
The reason
you're feeling pressure

161
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,625
is because your heart
isn't pumping like it should.

162
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:16,041
We discovered a hole
in between your two ventricles.

163
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:18,750
As soon as you get stronger,
I'll do surgery.

164
00:08:18,792 --> 00:08:21,000
We can fix this.
Is Michael here?

165
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:24,041
Has... he seen the baby?
We haven't found him yet.

166
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,041
The coast guard is still
searching the water.

167
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,041
Was... was he
in a boat with you?

168
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:31,041
Is that what happened?

169
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,041
Lauren?

170
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:34,375
No.

171
00:08:34,417 --> 00:08:37,709
He...

172
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,208
Left.

173
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:43,000
He told me he didn't love me
and he left.

174
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:46,333
How did you
end up in the water?

175
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:50,417
I thought that if I jumped,
the undertow would take me.

176
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:53,375
I wanted to die.
You shouldn't have saved me.

177
00:08:53,417 --> 00:08:56,750
I w--i want to die.

178
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:07,750
I don't want to feel better.

179
00:09:07,792 --> 00:09:11,041
I don't want surgery.
I don't want to be fixed.

180
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,250
What happened, Lauren?

181
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:18,208
W-What happened
with you and your husband?

182
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,083
That's just it.
I don't know.

183
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:26,583
We were gonna have a baby.
It was fine.

184
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:30,083
And then I came home,
and there was this note--

185
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:31,625
a note--

186
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:33,291
saying that he left.

187
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:36,375
Most of his things
were gone.

188
00:09:36,417 --> 00:09:38,792
And I don't know why.

189
00:09:38,834 --> 00:09:43,583
I waited for days for him
to come back or call.

190
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,291
I just felt empty.

191
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:50,250
I couldn't think.
I couldn't breathe.

192
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:54,709
And I just wanted it
to be over and done

193
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:58,709
so I wouldn't
feel that anymore...

194
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,041
And I wouldn't be alone.

195
00:10:02,792 --> 00:10:05,083
Well, you're--
you're not alone anymore.

196
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:07,041
You have a baby upstairs.

197
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,000
And I almost killed her.

198
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:15,625
You can't force me to have
this surgery, can you?

199
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:20,500
Uh, well, I-I think we'd all
like you to want it.

200
00:10:20,542 --> 00:10:22,542
Well, I don't.

201
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,625
Just tell them
that I refuse.

202
00:10:27,917 --> 00:10:30,917
A human bite?

203
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,917
She's denying it,
but she's got teeth marks

204
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,583
and her liver's tender,
she's got a yellowish pallor.
Well, it's certainly
a unique way

205
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:38,166
to transmit hep b.
And if the test confirms it,

206
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,792
we're gonna have to find out
who it is,

207
00:10:40,834 --> 00:10:43,792
'cause they're sick, too,
in more ways than one.
You think it's, like,
a sexual predator

208
00:10:43,834 --> 00:10:46,333
who likes biting young girls,
he's got her scared?

209
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,375
Maybe it's abuse.
What about her mother?

210
00:10:48,417 --> 00:10:50,875
I mean, biting her?
I doubt that.

211
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:53,667
Maybe it's some sort
of s&amp;M thing.

212
00:10:53,709 --> 00:10:55,041
She's 13 years old.

213
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,041
Who goes around
biting 13 year olds?

214
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,709
Try vampires.

215
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,542
Funny.
I'm serious.

216
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:05,333
Do you not live in america?
Do the words "twilight"

217
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:08,041
and "new moon"
mean nothing to you?
They're--they're fictional.

218
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,041
Not to teenage girls
who think

219
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:13,000
the bite of a vampire's
a sign of eternal love.

220
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:17,208
How could you let
some boy bite you?

221
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,208
I knew that you shouldn't
be hanging out

222
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,750
with that Amber and Ashley
and what's her name.
They didn't do anything.

223
00:11:21,792 --> 00:11:24,417
You have hepatitis.
You're in the hospital.

224
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,041
You're 13 years old.

225
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:29,667
Paige, I think we're gonna need
to know the name of the boy,

226
00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:32,667
because he may be sick, too.

227
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:36,417
You'll tell 'em
who it is, now.
Angie. Angie.

228
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,417
How could I have missed this?

229
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:41,959
Why don't you go
and grab a cup of coffee,

230
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,792
and let us talk to her?
Thanks.
It's okay.

231
00:11:44,834 --> 00:11:47,041
You don't understand.

232
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,041
He's my soul mate.

233
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,417
We're bound together
for all of eternity.

234
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:54,542
We love each other.
Well, that's nice,
but it shouldn't involve

235
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:57,208
biting so hard
that it draws blood.
Yeah.

236
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,667
It's just a sign
of what we are to each other.

237
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:02,500
And he's not sick, so you
don't need to do anything.

238
00:12:02,542 --> 00:12:05,291
He might not be sick now,
but he's carrying the disease,

239
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,208
and it could be
damaging his liver,

240
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,208
which is very serious.

241
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,208
If my mom knows who he is,

242
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,208
she'll never let me
see him again.

243
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,458
So if I get him to come in,

244
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,792
will you promise
not to tell my mom?
W--she should know.

245
00:12:18,834 --> 00:12:20,458
She can't.

246
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,542
So you promise...
Or I'm not telling.

247
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:30,583
You can't promise not to tell.
That kid bit her.

248
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,583
He drew blood. He got her sick.
Her labs are getting worse.
I know,
but it's her boyfriend,

249
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,625
and they were necking
in some perverse way.

250
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:37,125
It's sexual.
It's not violent.

251
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,834
It's like any other consensual
sex act a minor tells us about.

252
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:42,041
We are bound--
doctor-patient confidentiality.

253
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,041
Your dating habits aside...

254
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,750
Sucking blood is not sex.
Your lack
of dating habits aside,

255
00:12:46,792 --> 00:12:48,291
you heard what she said.

256
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,500
She thinks she's in love--
she's 13.

257
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:53,041
Bottom line is, it's sex.
It's not violence.

258
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:56,083
We can't do anything about it.
I'll make her the promise.

259
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:59,041
We'll get the kid in here.
I'll see if he's sick.

260
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,083
We'll figure it out
from there.

261
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,667
You know, we could always
seal his coffin,

262
00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:06,125
expose him to sunlight.

263
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:08,667
Without the surgery,
she will die.

264
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:11,041
Which is why you have to 51-50
her. Not having the surgery

265
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:14,041
is just another way for her
to attempt suicide.
Well, legally
and ethically speaking,

266
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:16,458
refusing treatment
isn't the same at all.

267
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,500
And she's depressed.
She's not crazy.

268
00:13:19,542 --> 00:13:21,667
She tried to kill herself
and her baby. That's not crazy?

269
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:24,291
No.
So she tries to kill herself,
fails,

270
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:27,291
but gets close enough that
she might actually get her wish?
She agreed to try
antidepressants.

271
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:30,291
That might help. Though I think
she probably only agreed to it

272
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:33,959
'cause she's hoping he'll
change his mind and come back.
Well, we can't wait for
the antidepressants to work.

273
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:37,709
She'll die.
We have to force the surgery.
No. Her depression
makes that a bad idea.

274
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,375
It doubles her risk
of dying on the table,

275
00:13:40,417 --> 00:13:42,917
and it's dicey enough
as it is.

276
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,041
All right, then I'll--
I'll go find Michael,

277
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:49,625
get him to come here.
What, you think it's that easy
to just make him love her?

278
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:52,417
His wife is dying.
He has a baby.

279
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,917
There could've been a thousand
reasons why he walked away.

280
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,834
I'm gonna go find him.
Good luck
trying to change his mind.

281
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,500
We've been calling,
leaving messages.

282
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:10,291
I know. I got them.

283
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:13,041
Your wife and child
are in the hospital.

284
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:16,083
Lauren's refusing to have
a surgery that could save her

285
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,542
because you're not there.

286
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:20,542
She said you left
out of the blue.
Ou-out of the blue?

287
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:23,041
Look, this didn't just happen.

288
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:26,041
I tr--i tried to get her
to see for a long time.

289
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,750
She just didn't...

290
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:31,750
She didn't want to see it.
She didn't want to listen.

291
00:14:31,792 --> 00:14:35,375
Then she got pregnant,
and I tried to make it work.

292
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:38,375
But I just--i... I can't.
What about the baby?

293
00:14:38,417 --> 00:14:41,041
I never wanted a baby.
She knew that.

294
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:45,583
And i-i--look, I tried to be
okay with that, but I'm not.

295
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,458
I don't love her anymore.

296
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,500
Okay, Michael, look,
can you just be there for her,

297
00:14:50,542 --> 00:14:54,250
just for now, just until
she's a little stronger?
Look, I'll support the baby.
I told her that.

298
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:57,583
But if i--if I go back,
she's just gonna do it again

299
00:14:57,625 --> 00:15:01,834
the next time I go,
and I'll never get away.

300
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,667
Look, what I did to Paige,
it's not a bad thing.

301
00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:15,458
It just signifies
that our souls are connected.

302
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,458
Yeah, but your viruses, too.

303
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,917
It's a health hazard.

304
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,583
So I do need to know...

305
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:23,542
If you've done this biting thing
with any other girls.

306
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:27,333
Of course not.
I'm just asking, you know,
doctor to patient, just us.

307
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,709
I don't mean
to embarrass you.

308
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,500
Look, you may not
understand this,

309
00:15:31,542 --> 00:15:33,750
but...

310
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:36,041
We're destined
for each other.

311
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:39,083
I would never betray that.

312
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:42,083
I've walked this earth
for 2,000 years,

313
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:44,834
searching for her.

314
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,041
Yeah.

315
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,834
Um, I've used
a lot of lines in my day.

316
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,208
I'm not buying that one.
Well, I'm not asking you to.

317
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,291
Okay, I'm gonna need to know
the names of all the girls

318
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,959
that you've done
this biting thing with.
Paige told me.
You can't tell anyone.

319
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,041
No, but I can tell her
what a little schmuck you are.
And you think
she'd believe you?

320
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:03,041
She and her friends love
all this vampire crap.

321
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:07,500
Tell me who else
you have bitten.
No offense, but bite me.

322
00:16:13,792 --> 00:16:15,750
Hey.
Hey.

323
00:16:15,792 --> 00:16:17,667
You have a minute?
You okay?

324
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:19,667
Ugh.
One of my patients

325
00:16:19,709 --> 00:16:22,667
has hung her entire
life's happiness on a man.

326
00:16:22,709 --> 00:16:25,375
He's gone,
and now she wants to die.

327
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,667
Well, she wouldn't be
the first person.

328
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:30,500
Why do women let men
do that to them,

329
00:16:30,542 --> 00:16:33,291
let 'em get inside their head
and make 'em crazy?

330
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:36,041
And they make us feel
really good when it's... good,

331
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,041
and then...
They make us want to

332
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:41,792
curl up in a little ball
and die when we can't have them.
We are talking about
your patient, right?

333
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,166
How's that speech going
for tonight?

334
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:46,041
Oh, ugh. William white--

335
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:48,583
I mean, how do you write
a speech about a billionaire?

336
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:51,959
You write about the man,
not the money.
Yeah, I know,
but it is William white.

337
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,500
You know, that's a man

338
00:16:53,542 --> 00:16:56,041
who could get into your head
and make you crazy.

339
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,375
You know--
you know what I think?
William white?

340
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,625
William white?

341
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:01,792
Ye--no.

342
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:06,458
All right, there...
There was a look.

343
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,750
Uh-huh.

344
00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:09,792
And a... moment.
Mm-hmm.

345
00:17:09,834 --> 00:17:12,667
And he touched my hand.
Oh! He likes you.

346
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:14,667
Oh...

347
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:16,750
All right, there was--
there was definitely something.

348
00:17:16,792 --> 00:17:18,542
But I just...

349
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:23,166
I can't decide whether
it was exciting or...

350
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,041
Sexual harassment-y or--

351
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:27,667
all the more reason
to go tonight, to find out.

352
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:30,041
I mean, that's what
these events are for.

353
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:33,041
And there's an open bar. I mean,
you get drunk, get lucky.
Yeah, but the idea of
getting dressed up

354
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,166
and--and pretending
to enjoy myself

355
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:38,208
with everything that's
going on, it's just--
oh, come on. It'll be fun.
We could both use it.

356
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,000
William white.

357
00:17:42,834 --> 00:17:44,291
William white.

358
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:48,375
Hey.
Your fever's down.

359
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:50,875
That's good.
How you feeling?
Great.

360
00:17:50,917 --> 00:17:53,375
Good.
I told you
Seth couldn't get sick.

361
00:17:53,417 --> 00:17:56,458
He's too strong. I must have
gotten this some other way.

362
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,625
Okay, um, Paige, there's
no good way to say this,

363
00:17:59,667 --> 00:18:01,417
so...

364
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:04,083
He's been biting other girls.

365
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,250
It doesn't work that way.

366
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:09,125
These other girls
could get sick.

367
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:13,125
He said they were your friends.
We need to know who they are.
Seth wouldn't do that.

368
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:16,041
My friends
wouldn't do that to me.
Well, Paige, he--

369
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,500
you don't get it.
Paige--

370
00:18:17,542 --> 00:18:20,083
stop trying to turn this
into something bad.

371
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,458
Oh, I gotta admit, Sam,
I'm lost.

372
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,458
This is all very pink.

373
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,041
Yeah, she wants, uh...
Pink candy almonds

374
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:36,667
with "Maya and dink forever"
stamped on them.

375
00:18:36,709 --> 00:18:38,625
So I'm trying to find...

376
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:40,417
So I guess the, uh,

377
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:43,041
the horse drawn carriage
is out?
Okay.

378
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:46,041
Wait. A hot air balloon...

379
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,583
Those are her ideas.

380
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,542
Hey.

381
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,667
Hey.
Hi.

382
00:18:54,709 --> 00:18:56,583
Wow, wedding stuff, huh?

383
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,875
Mm-hmm.
You need a hand?

384
00:18:58,917 --> 00:19:00,959
Uh, no. We're good.
We're good. Thanks.

385
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,083
What's up?

386
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,709
I just wanted to talk to you
about Lauren.

387
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,250
Did you talk to the husband?

388
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:11,250
Yeah, he doesn't want anything
to do with her or the baby.

389
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:15,000
Do you want me
to go with you to tell her?
We can't.

390
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,750
What,
you can't tell her?

391
00:19:16,792 --> 00:19:19,000
You think it's better
to give her false hope

392
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,500
that he's gonna show up?
If it gets her
into surgery, yeah.

393
00:19:21,542 --> 00:19:24,500
Oh, good. All right.
So then we lie to her,

394
00:19:24,542 --> 00:19:28,375
I fix her heart,
then we break it again.
But she'll be alive.
Unless you have a better idea.

395
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,375
I mean,
this way we have time

396
00:19:30,417 --> 00:19:32,375
for the antidepressants
to kick in.

397
00:19:32,417 --> 00:19:35,291
I mean, maybe he'll change
his mind and come around.

398
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,583
Oh, do you really think
that's gonna happen, Addison?

399
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:40,542
You really think that she should
wait around for that?

400
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:43,542
Violet, can you give us
a few minutes?

401
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,333
Yes.

Please tell me
how that is cheating.

413

You're scared.

418
00:20:22,417 --> 00:20:26,500
I am not scared, Sam.
You're scared because you know
that this could be real.

419
00:20:26,542 --> 00:20:28,041
Nothing's standing
between us.

420
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,041
I'm not married.
I don't live in Seattle.

She's my best friend.

00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:40,375
You divorced her, Sam.
I'm not willing to do that.
She--she would understand.

425
00:20:40,417 --> 00:20:43,375
If you were honest with her,
she would get over it.
Oh, what planet are you on?

426
00:20:43,417 --> 00:20:46,250
Y--she won't even forgive
her own child

427
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,625
for getting pregnant
by accident.

428
00:20:48,667 --> 00:20:50,625
You're planning a wedding

Not like I care.

Mm.

00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,208
I'm gonna go work the room.

456
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,417

not that much fun.

Tell me about it.
Now have a drink

458
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:20,041
and tell us what you
really think about him.
I meant what I said.

459
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:22,041
Right, after he forced me
down your throat?

460
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:24,041
Uh, figuratively speaking.

461
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:25,625
Or maybe you've forgiven him

462
00:22:25,667 --> 00:22:27,625
after you've realized
I'm not so bad.

463
00:22:27,667 --> 00:22:29,750

I'm not so bad.

And I'm on edge.

483
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:14,041
I'm uncomfortable in my skin,

484
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:16,625
and all I do is work all day.

485
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:19,583
All I do is mix sperm and ova
into petri dishes all day.

486
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:21,583
All I do
is make babies for people

487
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:24,083
who would do anything
to have a baby, you know,

488
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:26,083
people who are praying
to have a baby.

489
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:28,583
And my stupid child goes
and makes one in an instant,

490
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:30,583
and I just kinda
want to scream.

491
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:33,375
I want to scream because it's
just, like, it's crazy Karma.

492
00:23:33,417 --> 00:23:36,041
And I, uh... and it's like life
spanking me in the face.

493
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:38,041
And I'm just trying
to push through.

494
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,041
And, you know, I'm just
eating too much cake

495
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:42,041
and doing as well as I can,
you know?

496
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:44,458
And then you show up here today,
and--and you're my boss,

497
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,458
and--and I think
you're flirting with me,

498
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,917
which is--because if you're not
flirting with me,

499
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:51,750
then clearly I can add
delusional to my list of flaws,

500
00:23:51,792 --> 00:23:54,500
and, uh, also fired, because I
just said that out loud.

501
00:23:54,542 --> 00:23:56,208
But I'm just spending
so much time these days

502
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,667
keeping my mouth shut

00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:12,834
She wants to believe
in the fairy tale

679
00:32:12,875 --> 00:32:15,083
we've all been fed
as little girls

680
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:18,709
about knights and princes
and vampires.
Last time I checked, vampires
aren't from fairy tales.

681
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:21,208
They're from horror stories,
and this is health issue.

682
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:23,125
The bloodsucker
must be stopped,

683
00:32:23,166 --> 00:32:25,625
except Paige won't tell me
the names of her friends

684
00:32:25,667 --> 00:32:28,667
who have been biting ar--
you really don't get women
and heartbreak, Cooper.

685
00:32:28,709 --> 00:32:31,041
This girl's about to get
smacked upside the head

686
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:33,083
by the first
real one of her life.

687
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:35,083
Why don't I talk to her?

688
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:38,125
Pretty sure I know
where she's coming from.

689
00:32:42,625 --> 00:32:44,458
Hey.

690
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,750
The baby's doing better.
Lung function's improving.

691
00:32:47,792 --> 00:32:50,750
Lauren is still
refusing surgery.

692
00:32:50,792 --> 00:32:54,542
Well, we know those medications
don't work overnight.

693
00:32:54,583 --> 00:32:57,750
So...

694
00:32:57,792 --> 00:33:00,250
You and Sam...

695
00:33:00,291 --> 00:33:03,583
Is there something the rest
of us should know about?

696
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:06,166
Is there a problem
with the practice?

697
00:33:06,208 --> 00:33:08,041
Oh, no. No.

698
00:33:08,083 --> 00:33:10,041
There's--there's not
a problem, no.

699
00:33:10,083 --> 00:33:12,417
I've never seen you two
so hostile.

700
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:14,709
Is it the wedding?
It's nothing to worry about.

701
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:17,417
You know, I think I'm gonna take
the baby down to see Lauren,

702
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:20,041
show her that she has
something to live for.

703
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:22,166
I-I wouldn't recommend that.
Why not?

704
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:25,542
I... depression isn't
not understanding

705
00:33:25,583 --> 00:33:28,041
that you have something
to live for.

706
00:33:28,083 --> 00:33:30,041
It's knowing that
you should feel differently,

707
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:31,542
but it's so bad

708
00:33:31,583 --> 00:33:34,542
that all you want to do
is curl up and die.

709
00:33:34,583 --> 00:33:36,542
That's where she is.

710
00:33:36,583 --> 00:33:38,917
You think
she doesn't understand

711
00:33:38,959 --> 00:33:41,041
that she has
a beautiful baby up here?

712
00:33:41,083 --> 00:33:44,500
So what do we do?
We let her die?

713
00:33:44,542 --> 00:33:47,000
We wait. We hope.

714
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:49,083
We keep trying.

715
00:33:51,166 --> 00:33:54,333
I know
how it is, Paige, honestly.

716
00:33:54,375 --> 00:33:57,333
You love somebody. You want 'em
to love you back the same way.

717
00:33:57,375 --> 00:34:00,208
You think love
should be magic and perfect.

718
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,083
But real life
isn't like that.

719
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:04,542
You don't know him.

720
00:34:04,583 --> 00:34:06,250
I know guys like him.

721
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:09,458
I know he's biting
other girls besides you.

722
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,542
S-Seth would never
lie to me.

723
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:14,834
Men lie to us
all the time.

724
00:34:14,875 --> 00:34:17,166
And we lie to them.

725
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:20,667
Sometimes you do it to protect
yourself or the other person.

726
00:34:20,709 --> 00:34:23,792
Sometimes it's how you try
to get what you want.

727
00:34:23,834 --> 00:34:25,583
And sometimes
it's just easier.

728
00:34:25,625 --> 00:34:28,166
If you think love means
never lying to each other,

729
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:30,375
you're not ready for it.

730
00:34:30,417 --> 00:34:31,834
It's hard.

731
00:34:31,875 --> 00:34:34,458
I know it is.

732
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:38,583
You get bit.
You think it's for life.

733
00:34:40,542 --> 00:34:43,458
When you find out it isn't,
it hurts.

734
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,417
It leaves a scar.

735
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:49,083
But we need to figure out
who the other girls are, Paige.

736
00:34:49,125 --> 00:34:52,125
We can't help 'em
if we don't know who they are.

737
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:57,417
I don't
want to be alone again.

738
00:34:57,458 --> 00:34:59,250
I know.

739
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:03,041
Hey.

740
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:05,750
I need your advice, um...

741
00:35:05,792 --> 00:35:07,583
What, did somebody die?

742
00:35:07,625 --> 00:35:10,667
Uh, nope. Getting married.

743
00:35:10,709 --> 00:35:13,083
I'm--I'm helping Sam.

744
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:14,458
Oh.

745
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:18,333
I-I hope that's, uh...

746
00:35:18,375 --> 00:35:21,125
No, no, no, no, no, no.
It's--it's, um, it's good.

747
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:24,166
I'm, you know, glad he's not
going through it alone.

748
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:29,041
Um, that's--that's not what
the advice was about.

749
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:30,667
Um...

750
00:35:30,709 --> 00:35:31,875
William?

751
00:35:31,917 --> 00:35:34,959
I saw you two
on the dance floor last night.

752
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,667
Oh. Y--uh...

753
00:35:36,709 --> 00:35:38,500
Well, um,

754
00:35:38,542 --> 00:35:41,125
what--what--what exactly
did you see?

755
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:44,917
I saw my friend, who's been
going through a rough time,

756
00:35:44,959 --> 00:35:47,041
enjoying herself
in the company

757
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:49,041
of a charming, rich bachelor.

758
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:51,208
Do you like him?

759
00:35:53,583 --> 00:35:55,083
I don't know.

760
00:35:55,125 --> 00:35:57,500
I mean, I'm flattered.

761
00:35:57,542 --> 00:36:00,375
And I don't care
about the rich.
Doesn't hurt.

762
00:36:00,417 --> 00:36:02,291
No, it doesn't hurt,
but, uh...

763
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:03,750
I don't know.

764
00:36:03,792 --> 00:36:06,291
I mean, I-I-I thought
he was one thing,

765
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:10,667
and turns out maybe
he's, uh, more than that.

766
00:36:12,583 --> 00:36:15,000
Then maybe
that's what you need.

767
00:36:21,083 --> 00:36:22,709
Oh, Naomi.

768
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:25,959
You can tell me
to butt out, and I will.

769
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,792
But this wedding, it--

770
00:36:27,834 --> 00:36:30,041
look, it's all wrong.

771
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:33,125
But it is
only gonna happen once.

772
00:36:33,166 --> 00:36:37,709
And I would hate to see you
stuck... on the outside.

773
00:36:40,291 --> 00:36:43,458
She's in pulmonary edema.

774
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,834
Lauren, Lauren, listen to me.

775
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:47,834
I found Michael,
and he's not coming back.

776
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:49,792
You have to face the truth.

777
00:36:49,834 --> 00:36:53,583
You want him and you can't have
him, and I know that's awful.

778
00:36:53,625 --> 00:36:56,041
Lauren, we all lose things
that we love,

779
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:58,834
but we have to find a way
to move on.
I don't know
if I'm strong enough.

780
00:37:00,917 --> 00:37:03,375
Look, your baby
fought like hell to survive.

781
00:37:03,417 --> 00:37:06,875
She's one day old, and she found
the strength, and so can you.

782
00:37:06,917 --> 00:37:09,417
You have to do
the surgery, Lauren, now.

783
00:37:09,458 --> 00:37:11,417
Okay.

784
00:37:11,458 --> 00:37:13,875
All right, I'll get a team
to scrub in.

785
00:37:23,709 --> 00:37:26,000
There's someone here
to see you.

786
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:39,625
Oh, I'm so sorry.

787
00:37:39,667 --> 00:37:43,917
I'm sorry I hurt you.

788
00:37:52,083 --> 00:37:53,875
Hey.
Hey.

789
00:37:53,917 --> 00:37:55,500
You did good work.

790
00:37:55,542 --> 00:37:57,500
Yeah, the--the repair
went well.

791
00:37:57,542 --> 00:38:00,583
I'm, uh, I'm happy for her.

792
00:38:00,625 --> 00:38:01,792
Sam...

793
00:38:01,834 --> 00:38:04,333
Are we gonna get past this?

794
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:08,500
I'm trying, Addison.

795
00:38:19,375 --> 00:38:21,333
Hey.

796
00:38:21,375 --> 00:38:22,709
Hey.

797
00:38:24,792 --> 00:38:27,041
I'm just, uh,
picking out flowers

798
00:38:27,083 --> 00:38:28,750
and... linens.

799
00:38:28,792 --> 00:38:30,750
Who--who knew
that there were, like,

800
00:38:30,792 --> 00:38:34,000
ten different shades of pink?

801
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:47,625
No more than 50 guests.

802
00:38:47,667 --> 00:38:49,625
St. Mark's for the ceremony,

803
00:38:49,667 --> 00:38:53,709
and afterwards, a small,
tasteful reception.

804
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,709
Call Mark's gardens
for the flowers.

805
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,583
No taffeta or sequins
anywhere.

806
00:38:58,625 --> 00:39:01,208
Uh, Tasha at Renée Strauss
can pick out a dress

807
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:03,583
that is appropriate
and not ridiculously expensive.

808
00:39:03,625 --> 00:39:06,709
Palisades catering
can do a buffet.

809
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:08,291
And, uh...

810
00:39:08,333 --> 00:39:10,750
Sparkling cider
instead of champagne,

811
00:39:10,792 --> 00:39:13,291
seeing as the bride
is pregnant and...

812
00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:16,625
The groom is underage.

813
00:39:16,667 --> 00:39:18,500
Naomi--

814
00:39:18,542 --> 00:39:21,041
uh, that's all I can do.

815
00:39:21,083 --> 00:39:24,041
Okay? That's, uh, that's--
that's all I can do.

816
00:39:24,083 --> 00:39:26,375
Okay.

817
00:39:49,375 --> 00:39:53,000
Wow.

818
00:39:53,041 --> 00:39:55,000
I wish I could do that...

819
00:39:56,709 --> 00:40:01,041
Just some gesture that would
put me past all this.

820
00:40:01,083 --> 00:40:03,583
You could.

821
00:40:03,625 --> 00:40:05,625
I could.

822
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,709
But I can't.

823
00:40:24,709 --> 00:40:27,041
Heading out?

824
00:40:27,083 --> 00:40:28,709
Oh, yeah.

825
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:30,041
Uh, sorry.

826
00:40:30,083 --> 00:40:32,041
It's just been
one of those days.

827
00:40:32,083 --> 00:40:35,500
Well, maybe you should get
a glass of wine with me then.

828
00:40:35,542 --> 00:40:38,041
Oh, I don't...
I don't know. I--
