Oh, you're so sweet.

Yeah.

She's waiting for me
in my office

with her husband right now.

43
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:44,875
God. Why they'd even bother

44
00:01:44,917 --> 00:01:47,875
to do marriage counseling again
after last year...

45
00:01:47,917 --> 00:01:51,041
You know she calls that
poor sweet man the weasel?

46
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:53,041
Violet, she threw
a coffee cup at my head.

47
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:54,625
I have a scar.

48
00:01:54,667 --> 00:01:56,625
She's got anger issues.
Yeah.

49
00:01:56,667 --> 00:01:59,667
You know, I mean, deep,
unresolved anger issues.

50
00:01:59,709 --> 00:02:02,458
Oh! Look at you.

51
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,709
I know. Crazy, huh?

52
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,333
Your mom's on her way up.
You ready?
Oh, you were gonna
tell me something?

53
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:10,000
I'll tell you later.

54
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:16,041
Are you still, uh,
not talking to me?

55
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:18,583
Okay. I had sex
with Charlotte last night.

56
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:20,583
It was supposed
to be just dinner,

57
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:24,542
but it became dinner with sex.
I don't know what to do.

58
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:26,542
I had to do it, Violet.

59
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:29,041
I couldn't lie on the stand.
Come on, really?

60
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:32,083
I need to talk to you.
Talk to somebody else.

61
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:38,625
H-Hello?

62
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:41,583
Dr. Turner?

63
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:44,333
It is so good
to see you. Mm.

64
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:47,333
Oh. It's great
to see you, too, Claire.

65
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,959
Um...

66
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,125
Yeah.

67
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:54,208
She's happy.

68
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,041
Yes, I can see that.

69
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,583
No, I mean, really happy.

70
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,917
Irwin thinks
I have dementia.
Sweetie,
I don't think that.

71
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:02,083
It's just, you're usually
not a happy person,

72
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:03,709
and you changed,
just overnight.

73
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,208
Something's wrong.
Oh, just say it, irwin.

74
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,667
Come on, say it.
I was a bitch.

75
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:10,041
Right, Dr. Turner?

76
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,125
It's okay.
I was a huge bitch.

77
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:13,875
Right?

78
00:03:13,917 --> 00:03:16,959
But I am not anymore.
I'm feeling better.

79
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,792
And I'm doing charity work.

80
00:03:18,834 --> 00:03:20,458
That's--that's wonderful.

81
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,458
She gave away
all of our money...
Uh-huh.

82
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,458
To a church.
Didn't need it.

83
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,458
And now she's--well, we're
having a lot of sex now.
You think he'd be thrilled.

84
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,333
I am, I am. I...
It's not her.

85
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,959
You know my wife.

86
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,959
Well, uh, c-Claire,
how would you explain

87
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,333
this, uh, t-transformation?

88
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:39,959
I can feel him in my soul...

89
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,041
Inside me.

90
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:44,000
God.

91
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,625
I have found god.

92
00:03:45,667 --> 00:03:50,041
I have been touched
by the hand of god.

93
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:00,000
Stop staring at me
like I'm about to keel over.

94
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,375
I'm fine.

95
00:04:01,417 --> 00:04:04,000
I just--i just wish
you wouldn't be so stubborn.

96
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,792
You know,
you need to be resting.
I'll rest later.

97
00:04:06,834 --> 00:04:08,166
Hey, guys.
Pete.

98
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,166
William, good to see you.
How you feeling?

99
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:13,291
Oh, let's just say
I'm glad to be home.

100
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,333
Uh... if you'll excuse me,

101
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:17,959
I have some work to do
in my office.

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,875
Okay.

103
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:25,542
The flight from Switzerland
really took

104
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,709
a lot out of him.

105
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,250
Is there anything I can do?

106
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:32,875
Uh, I'm consulting with
some a-list specialists,

107
00:04:32,917 --> 00:04:35,291
see if there's something else
that we can try.

108
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,041
He has to keep fighting.

109
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:40,458
I can't let him give up,
not now.

110
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,041
Well, that's what you want.
What about what he wants?

111
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:48,083
I think
he's come back to die.

112
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,583
Thank you. Hello.
I'm Dr. Montgomery.

113
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:57,041
Hi, I'm George Walters.
This is my daughter Kim.

114
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:58,542
Hi, Kim. The E.R. doctor

115
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,542
says you're having
a lot of back pain.

116
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,542
It started
a few days ago.

117
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:04,875
It says here
you're at 30 weeks.

118
00:05:04,917 --> 00:05:07,125
You haven't had
any prenatal care?
We live on a farm.

119
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,875
It's difficult for us
to get into the city.
Okay.

120
00:05:09,917 --> 00:05:12,041
Uh, well, let's take
a look here.

121
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:17,458
Is my baby okay?
She's the appropriate size
for her dates.

122
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,041
She?

123
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,709
It's a girl?

124
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,500
Oh, y-yes.
I'm sorry. I--

125
00:05:22,542 --> 00:05:26,500
I'd appreciate it if you could
make it as quick as possible.

126
00:05:26,542 --> 00:05:28,709
I'd like to take
my daughter home.

127
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,709
Okay.

128
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,083
Weird how?

129
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,709
I don't know. Just weird.
You'll see.

130
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,333
Hi, I'm Dr. Bennett.

131
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:38,959
I'm a cardiothoracic
specialist.

132
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,333
I'd like to speak with you
about your scans.

133
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:44,208
Uh, if you'd like, your father
can wait in the lounge.

134
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm fine here.
Okay. Well...

135
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:49,000
Uh, what you have
is an aortic aneurysm.

136
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,375
Uh, it's an abnormal widening

137
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:53,834
of the large artery
in your abdomen.

138
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:57,041
We're going to need
to do surgery.
We're hoping to avoid it
until the baby's further along,

139
00:05:57,083 --> 00:06:00,041
but we will need to keep you
here under observation.

140
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:03,041
How long?
I don't know. Uh, we've ordered
some repeat ultrasounds.

141
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:05,041
And we're going to need
to review

142
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:08,750
your family medical history--
mother, father, siblings.

143
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:10,125
My mother's dead.

144
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,208
Why do you need all that?
It's standard.

145
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,959
A medical history helps point us
in the right direction

146
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,959
when we're trying
to evaluate a problem.

147
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,750
You and I can talk further

148
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:20,750
while your daughter's
undergoing the test.

149
00:06:20,792 --> 00:06:24,208
No, I'm going with her.

150
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:34,166
Didn't your mother teach you,
it's not polite to stare?

151
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:35,291
Gabriel...

152
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:38,375
I know you're upset
with the way we left things.

153
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,583
But William needed me.

154
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,041
Hey. I get it.

155
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:45,417
Any woman in your position
would've made the same choice.

156
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47,041
In this corner--

157
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,041
angry, sarcastic guy
in a wheelchair,

158
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,041
who,
obviously a dynamo in bed,

159
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,041
can't exactly
sweep you off your feet.

160
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,041
And in this corner,
you got old moneybags,

161
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,166
who, if you marry real quick,
well, let's just say,

162
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,166
you'd make for
an extremely attractive,

163
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:02,625
not to mention
wealthy widow.

164
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:08,667
I want you to try
the a.L.S. Protocol on William.

165
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:11,041
The one that still needs
f.D.A. Approval?

166
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:14,125
The one that would be completely
delegitimized if we use it?

167
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,917
Yes. Will you do it?

168
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,917
Wow. Amazing.

169
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:21,083
Little miss moral compass

170
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:24,083
is suddenly willing to blow off
everything she believes in.

171
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:28,041
Gabriel... I'm asking you
to think about it.

172
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,041
Okay?

173
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,834
Just think about it.

174
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,583
Hey.

175
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:39,041
So, uh, based on Kim's
repeat scan,

176
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,041
I recommend surgery now.

177
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,041
Oh, but the fetus
is only 30 weeks.

178
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:44,583
It's too risky.

179
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:47,792
Yeah, well, blowing
the aneurysm could be riskier.

180
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:49,792
Kim tested positive
for the gene

181
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:51,917
associated
with fibrillin disease?
Yeah, it explains
the aneurysm.

182
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,917
But it's
an autosomal dominant disease.

183
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:56,667
I mean, it's inherited from
the father. Is she adopted?

184
00:07:56,709 --> 00:08:00,083
Well, George never mentioned it
in his family history.

185
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:01,667
He doesn't have the disease.

186
00:08:01,709 --> 00:08:04,041
He's not her father.
He can't be.

187
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,792
Well, then who is he?

188
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:12,709
She says she feels god,

189
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,500
and it changed her.

190
00:08:14,542 --> 00:08:16,083
Just like that,
she changed?

191
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,709
Just like that.

192
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,083
People don't change.

193
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,750
Of course they do.

194
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,750
They modify. They adjust.

195
00:08:22,792 --> 00:08:25,333
But underneath,
we are who we are.

196
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,375
That's not true.

197
00:08:27,417 --> 00:08:29,709
I-I know it's not true.

198
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,709
My entire career is based on

199
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,750
helping people
become who they can be.

200
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:36,208
People do change.
I've seen it.

201
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,041
People just get better
at covering up their flaws.

202
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,166
There.

203
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,875
What is that?

204
00:08:42,917 --> 00:08:46,041
That... is Claire's god.

205
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,041
Don't you guys have
your own cereal downstairs?

206
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,041
Naomi doesn't let us

207
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:02,250
buy the kind
with marshmallows in it.

208
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,875
Hey. How do you get
someone to talk to you

209
00:09:04,917 --> 00:09:06,333
that won't talk to you?

210
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,959
Charlotte?
Uh, no, not this time.

211
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,834
Actually, we're doing okay.
It's Violet.

212
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:13,125
She's being...
I don't know, mean to me.

213
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:16,166
She's being mean to me,
and she's never mean to me.

214
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,041
And I said I was sorry.

215
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,041
Well, just, uh,
keep on keeping on.

216
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,041
Is that the best you can do?

217
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:25,291
'Cause I can get that
from a bumper sticker.
She's hurt, Cooper.

218
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,291
You can't expect her
to come around

219
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,291
as soon
as you apologize to her.

220
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:32,291
Because even if she understands
your explanation intellectually,

221
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:35,041
she, uh, still has to
accept it... emotionally.

222
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,667
And that takes time.

223
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:39,583
So keep on keepin' on.

224
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,375
Exactly.

225
00:09:41,417 --> 00:09:43,500
Okay.

226
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:46,041
Hey, uh, you want to hear
something pretty cool,

227
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,041
something I haven't told
anybody else?

228
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,959
I got into
u.C.L.A. Medical school.

229
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,959
- Oh, my god!
- Oh, oh, oh, okay.

230
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,041
That's fantastic.
Congratulations.

231
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:58,041
Yeah, I have no idea
how I'd pay for it, but--

232
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,333
hey.
Oh, I'm sorry I'm late.

233
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,542
I hope I didn't miss
all the fun.

234
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,959
No, we're
just getting started.
Hey, mom.

235
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,291
Hey. Thanks for
having me here, hon.

236
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:10,041
Wow. Three weeks to go.
Yeah.
Everything looks great.

237
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,458
Heart rate is strong.
Yeah?

238
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,125
Yeah.
Oh, I remember
my last month with you.

239
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,125
I was so nervous,
kept looking up

240
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,125
every possible obstetric
complication in the book.

241
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,583
I was driving your dad crazy.

242
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:24,458
It can be a little scary,
you know?

243
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,542
So do you have
any questions?

244
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,750
I'm fine.
You have a plan?

245
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:31,041
I've got it all worked out--
totally natural birth...

246
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:33,041
Dell's doing
the delivery here.
Uh-huh.

247
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:35,458
I do my squatting exercises
in the morning,

248
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,667
my relaxation techniques
in the afternoon.

249
00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:39,667
That's so I won't need
an epidural.

250
00:10:39,709 --> 00:10:41,250
Um, my bag is packed,

251
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:44,250
and dink made a mix cd
for my birthing music.

252
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,041
I'm so ready.

253
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,667
Wow.

254
00:10:47,709 --> 00:10:50,041
Wow. You've just--
you've thought of everything.

255
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,041
You don't have to worry
about me, mom.

256
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:55,041
You not being around
actually helped.

257
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,041
It gave me a chance
to grow up,

258
00:10:57,083 --> 00:11:00,000
figure things out
on my own.

259
00:11:01,792 --> 00:11:04,208
Thanks for doing
the consult, Sheldon.

260
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,583
Ordinarily, I'd ask Violet,
but things have been

261
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,041
a little weird
since the tri--

262
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,417
Sheldon?

263
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,417
I know, stopping elevators
is your thing,

264
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:14,417
but today, I...

265
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,834
I need to change things up
a little.

266
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,125
Wait. You need help...
From me?

267
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,417
Sheldon, you sent me a bill
last time.

268
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:24,417
When I asked for
elevator advice, you charged me.

269
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:27,625
All right. Well, I'm gonna send
you a bill, and I'm expensive.

270
00:11:27,667 --> 00:11:29,208
I have many
board certifications.

271
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,208
Only eight people in the world
do what I do.

272
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,000
I can give you a pap smear,
operate on your uterus

273
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:37,667
and perform surgery on your baby
before and after he's born.

274
00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:40,041
Are you gonna listen to me
or not?

275
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,417
All right. Spill it.

276
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:44,041
It's about Charlotte.
I've been giving her advice

277
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:47,667
on how to get back together
with Cooper, but the thing is,

278
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:51,000
I think about her, Addison.

279
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:53,375
When she's not around, I think
about the way she smiles,

280
00:11:53,417 --> 00:11:55,041
the way she looks at me.
I-I...

281
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:58,041
My god, I spend half my day
coming up with lame reasons

282
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,250
to go up and visit her.

283
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:03,208
D-Do you know how many times
I've borrowed stamps from her?

284
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,917
I don't even use stamps.
I pay my bills electronically.

285
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,625
Listen to me, Sheldon.

286
00:12:09,667 --> 00:12:11,625
You want her? Go get her.

287
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:13,625
You have to try.
If not, you're gonna spend

288
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:16,166
the rest of your life
kicking yourself

289
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:20,208
and wondering why you didn't
man up and go for it.

290
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,041
Thank you.

291
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:28,500
Do you have
the test results?

292
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:31,500
Can we go home now?
Actually, the results
were inconclusive.

293
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:35,041
We're gonna need her
for one more test.

294
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:37,417
You can stay here.
Why? I want to be with her.

295
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,750
We need her for radiology,
some x-rays.

296
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,750
You're not allowed
in the room.

297
00:12:41,792 --> 00:12:43,750
It's all right.
She'll be right back.

298
00:12:43,792 --> 00:12:47,083
I'll be waiting
for you here, Kim.

299
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,750
Appreciate it.

300
00:12:50,792 --> 00:12:53,333
God is in a brain tumor?

301
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,083
I'm sorry.
That sounds ridiculous.

302
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,667
Well, it's actually
a well-known phenomena.

303
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:01,125
The temporal lobe

304
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,834
contains the emotional engine
of our brains.

305
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,834
It's the center
of all of our feelings.

306
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:08,250
So anything--rage, lust,
anger, passion, bliss--

307
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,875
anything that stimulates
that part of the brain

308
00:13:10,917 --> 00:13:12,500
can elicit those feelings.

309
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,750
But they're not real.

310
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:16,750
They're just misdirected
neural impulses.

311
00:13:16,792 --> 00:13:19,125
They're...
Random short circuits.

312
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,041
You're wrong.

313
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,041
They are real.

314
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:26,709
I can feel it.
It's happiness.

315
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,041
I've never felt it before,
but...

316
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:32,000
It's like I-I had this giant
weight on my shoulders

317
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:34,041
and--and now
the weight is lifted.

318
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,000
That doesn't just happen,
that's not just...

319
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,792
Chemical reactions
in my brain.

320
00:13:37,834 --> 00:13:39,291
And you know what?

321
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:42,333
If it takes a magic bullet
in my head to do god's work,

322
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,750
then that's his plan.

323
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:50,041
It's a slow-growing tumor.

324
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,500
With surgery, your chance
of recovery is excellent.

325
00:13:52,542 --> 00:13:54,000
But without it...

326
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:00,417
What, you're saying this tumor's
gonna kill my wife?

327
00:14:03,792 --> 00:14:06,000
Without the surgery,
you will die.

328
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,041
I spent three years

329
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,041
in intensive therapy
with Dr. Turner,

330
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:18,458
and I didn't have
a happy bone in my body.

331
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,667
Now I've found god.
He's in me.

332
00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:26,291
If dying is god's plan,
then so be it.

333
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,959
I thought we were going
to radiology.
Uh, we are.

334
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,959
I just wanted you to consult
with one more doctor, Kim,

335
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,333
before we do your test.

336
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,917
Hi, Kim.
I'm Dr. Wallace.

337
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,834
Nothing?

338
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,917
Nothing? Did you--did you
check with n.I.H.?

339
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,166
Yeah, I know, I know.
I knew it was a long shot.

340
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,083
Thank you for trying,
Dr. Klein.

341
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,709
Okay.

342
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,250
What do I have to do,
Gabriel?

343
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:06,417
Do I have to beg?
Okay, I will beg.

344
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,500
What you're asking
is unethical and illegal.

345
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:11,208
The protocol is not approved.

346
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,291
If I give it to William,
it will never be.

347
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,583

348
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:18,041
No.

349
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,834
If you don't help him,
he is going to die.

350
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:28,333
Well, then I guess
he's going to die.

351
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,125
She's rational and oriented.

352
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,041
There's no evidence
of delusional thinking.

353
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,917
She's entirely capable

354
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,917
of making decisions
about her own treatment, so--
she can't decide.

355
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:48,500
She thinks she has
a personal pipeline to god.

356
00:15:48,542 --> 00:15:51,041
This woman was miserable
her entire life until now.

357
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,041
And you are telling her
to accept a treatment

358
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,041
that would bring
all that pain back,

359
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,667
to just live with it.

360
00:15:57,709 --> 00:15:59,917
I-I may not agree
with her decision,

361
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,959
but I certainly understand
her refusal

362
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,250
to let you do that to her.

363
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,291
Why would anyone choose
to feel worse?

364
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:09,458
Because without the surgery,
she will die.

365
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,041
And Claire understands that.

366
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,083
She believes
it's part of god's plan.

367
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:16,500
If god
is not gonna do his job,

368
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:21,041
I guess I'll have to do it
for him.

369
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:23,000
So you don't remember
your mother at all?

370
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:24,041
No.

371
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,041
Well, how old were you
when she died?

372
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,834
I'm not sure.

373
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,750
You keep looking at the door.

374
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:35,041
Are you afraid
your father's gonna come in?

375
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,458
Or hoping he'll come in?

376
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,542
Do you have plans
for your future?

377
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:45,041
Do you want
to go to college or...

378
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,542
My dad doesn't think
I need it.

379
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:50,750
Well, the two of you,
you're very close.

380
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:54,750
We have
a special relationship.

381
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,333
How so?

382
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:01,625
When's my dad gonna be back?

383
00:17:01,667 --> 00:17:04,667
Soon.

384
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:06,583
Kim,
this abnormality you have,

385
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,166
it's a condition
you inherit from a father--

386
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:12,166
only from a father--
and George doesn't have it.

387
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,166
My dad says
doctors don't know

388
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:17,959
what they're talking about
half the time.

389
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,458
Well, your father...

390
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,458
He seems to know everything.

391
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,792
Of course he does.

392
00:17:24,834 --> 00:17:26,834
He's my dad.

393
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,041
Her answers felt rehearsed,
you know, and planned.

394
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,000
And she's been
extremely isolated.

395
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,000
She doesn't watch TV
or use the Internet.

396
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:37,875
She can't even remember
the last time she left the farm.

397
00:17:37,917 --> 00:17:40,041
I think we should call
the police.

398
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,500
The police?
I'm not 100% sure, but I think
we may be witnessing

399
00:17:42,542 --> 00:17:44,500
a kidnapped girl
and her abductor.

400
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:46,458
What?

401
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,208
We're leaving.

402
00:17:51,959 --> 00:17:53,458
Kim, get out of bed.

403
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,250

We're going home.

404
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,875

You can't leave.
No, George. Whoa.

616

when you told Annie mersel,

617
00:27:34,542 --> 00:27:36,500
who I'm pretty sure
I was falling in love with,

618
00:27:36,542 --> 00:27:38,542
that I wasn't
the marrying kind because

619
00:27:38,583 --> 00:27:42,000
you couldn't picture us together
in 20 years, I forgave you.
Cooper--

puking in my new car,
puking in my old bed

621
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:46,834
or using the 1910 silver dollar
my grandfather gave me

622
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:50,583
for my bar mitzvah
to pay the pizza guy...

623
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:53,083

624
00:27:53,125 --> 00:27:54,709

625
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:57,208

they hurt each other...

626

627
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:01,917

628
00:28:01,959 --> 00:28:04,375

631
00:28:12,041 --> 00:28:15,041
You once told a woman
I had just started dating

632
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:18,041
that I have
a very small nightstick,

633
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:20,667
which was unforgivable
and also...

634
00:28:20,709 --> 00:28:22,166
A lie.

635
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:34,250

636
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,333
Mm.

637
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:40,041

639
00:28:42,041 --> 00:28:44,041

640
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:46,041
My baby?
She's doing great.

641
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:48,041
Kim, we spoke with the FBI.

642
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:50,041

your biological parents.

643
00:28:50,083 --> 00:28:52,166

He can't hurt you.

644
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:54,166
We have a police officer
stationed at the door.

645
00:28:54,208 --> 00:28:56,041
You are safe here.

646
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:57,792
No.

647
00:28:57,834 --> 00:29:00,959
You don't understand.

648
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,709
I need to see him.

649
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,625
I love him.

650
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:11,875
The procedure went well.

651
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:14,250
I'll probably send Claire home
in a few days.

652
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:16,041

We'll see.

653

are they--the damn doctors?

654
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:21,041

655
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:22,667
I'm sorry.

656
00:29:22,709 --> 00:29:24,291
I can't.

657
00:29:24,333 --> 00:29:26,083
Claire.

658
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:28,250
You lied to me, you bitch.

659
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:32,667
You pushed me to do this.
Now I have nothing. Nothing!

660
00:29:32,709 --> 00:29:34,959
You shoulda
let me die happy.

661
00:29:40,792 --> 00:29:42,750
He kidnapped her,
assaulted her

662
00:29:42,792 --> 00:29:44,750
and kept her
away from her real family,

663
00:29:44,792 --> 00:29:46,750
and she still
wants to see him?

664
00:29:46,792 --> 00:29:49,750
The police said George
held her captive for 15 years.

665
00:29:49,792 --> 00:29:51,792
He's been the only person
in her life,

666
00:29:51,834 --> 00:29:53,792
putting clothes on her back
and feeding her

667
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:55,792
and making all the decisions
in her life.

668
00:29:55,834 --> 00:29:57,792
To her,
he is her real family.

669
00:29:57,834 --> 00:29:59,792
It's the only love
she knows.

670
00:29:59,834 --> 00:30:02,500
Oh, it's just too perverse
to comprehend.

671
00:30:02,542 --> 00:30:05,041
Well, all Kim sees
is that he took care of her,

672
00:30:05,083 --> 00:30:06,542
protected her.

673
00:30:06,583 --> 00:30:08,542
Have they located her family,
her parents?

674
00:30:08,583 --> 00:30:10,250
I mean,
maybe when she sees them--

675
00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:12,250
she's been totally
cut off from the world.

676
00:30:12,291 --> 00:30:14,250
And over time,
that old love she knew

677
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:16,041
became vague, faded memories.

678
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:18,041
And eventually,
in order to survive,

679

I ran out on you...

691
00:30:47,041 --> 00:30:49,417
When I should've leaned in.

692
00:30:49,458 --> 00:30:53,625
I gave you my baby
and... I ran.

693
00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:55,625
And part of it's not my fault.

694
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:57,667
Part of it's
what happened to me,

695
00:30:57,709 --> 00:31:00,208
but there's this--
there's this other piece,

696
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,834
and...

697
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:04,166
You loved me.

698
00:31:04,208 --> 00:31:07,000
You loved me...

699
00:31:07,041 --> 00:31:11,041
And I should've
leaned into that.

700
00:31:11,083 --> 00:31:13,875
I should've let you
take care of me.

701
00:31:13,917 --> 00:31:16,208
But I didn't...

702
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:18,250

703
00:31:18,291 --> 00:31:20,041
Because I don't know how.

704
00:31:22,083 --> 00:31:24,041
You know, I'm that person.
I'm a shrink.

705
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:26,041
I take care of other people,

to share Lucas with me,

709
00:31:36,959 --> 00:31:38,917
of course you said no.

710
00:31:38,959 --> 00:31:40,917
I-I shouldn't have been hurt.

711

I shouldn't have taken you
to court.

712
00:31:43,041 --> 00:31:46,000
I lost my happiness,

713
00:31:46,041 --> 00:31:48,417

714
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:52,041
