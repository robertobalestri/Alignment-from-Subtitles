00:00:03,291 --> 00:00:05,083
♪ Ohhh ohhh ohhh ♪

2
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:10,625
I couldn't sleep.

3
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:13,750
I kept trying to tell myself
that it was from something

4
00:00:13,792 --> 00:00:15,500
other than Sam,
but, I mean, come on.

5
00:00:15,542 --> 00:00:18,709
How can I ignore the fact
that my bed is half empty?

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,041
It's like this space
that I can't occupy.

7
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:27,750
You know, it's his space.
Sam's space. He belongs there.

8
00:00:27,792 --> 00:00:31,625
Anyway, so I'm up, flipping
around through the channels,

9
00:00:31,667 --> 00:00:33,625
and I came across
this documentary.

10
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:36,667
What about?
The history of shin-kicking.

11
00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:39,959
I had no idea that
this existed as a sport.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,041
I mean, for 400 years

13
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,959
men have been kicking
each other in the shins.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,667
Like, professionally.

15
00:00:46,709 --> 00:00:49,625
What was so captivating
about it?

16
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:52,166
Ha, ha. I don't know. I--

17
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:53,709
uh...

18
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,750
I couldn't sleep.

19
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:26,000
You, uh, all right there?
Yeah.

20
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:28,542
No.

21
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:30,041
Sam and I broke up.

22
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:31,959
What?
I lost my boyfriend

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,709
and my baby in one day.

24
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:39,500
And I haven't
been sleeping much.

25
00:01:39,542 --> 00:01:42,333
I'm sorry about you and Sam.
Really. Uh...

26
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:45,625
But you didn't lose your baby.
Someone else got theirs.

27
00:01:45,667 --> 00:01:47,917
You'll get yours. I mean,
adoption's always on the table.

28
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:51,709
Well, I'm not really interested
in being picked over again.

29
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,208
Well, there's
always surrogacy.

30
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,709
I can get you a great donor egg
and a healthy surrogate.

31
00:01:57,583 --> 00:01:59,625
I'm tired.

32
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:01,375
All right, I know it's hard
to think about now,

33
00:02:01,417 --> 00:02:02,625
but you do have options.

34
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,750
Why not surrogacy?

35
00:02:06,792 --> 00:02:09,166
You get your baby and someone
else's boobs take the hit.

36
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:13,291
Heh. Because I've already jumped
through a thousand hoops.

37
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,291
I don't think I can make it
through a thousand more.

38
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,041
All right, tell me something.

39
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:18,542
Take my mind off this.

40
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:20,959
Well, I'm staying sober.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I don't miss Ryan any less,
but I'm sober.

42
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:28,375
He'd be proud of you.

43
00:02:28,417 --> 00:02:30,125
I'm proud of you.

44
00:02:35,417 --> 00:02:36,834
I overslept.

45
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:38,500
Turned your alarm off.

46
00:02:38,542 --> 00:02:40,417
Why?
You think I didn't hear you two

47
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,041
giggling with the TV on
past midnight?

48
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:44,041
The cartoon channel was playing
a pokémon marathon

49
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,291
that Mason
had never seen.

50
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,041
The rise of darkrai.

51
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,500
You had no business
keeping that boy up so late.

52
00:02:49,542 --> 00:02:52,750
He is off from school today.
You are not.

53
00:02:52,792 --> 00:02:54,792
Where's Mason?
He's in your office.

54
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:57,333
Did he eat?
Yep.

55
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:58,625
I can crack an egg.

56
00:02:58,667 --> 00:03:00,625
He's nervous about
his spelling bee.

57
00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:02,500
I promised to--
I quizzed him on the way in.

58
00:03:02,542 --> 00:03:04,625
His toothbrush
looked a little ragged,

59
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:05,917
so we stopped
and got a new one.

60
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:09,625
Erica will be by
in a little bit to pick him up.

61
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:12,458
Don't get used to it.

62
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,625
My partner and I
were following a car

63
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:16,750
that had just been involved
in an armed robbery.

64
00:03:16,792 --> 00:03:21,542
All of a sudden, the guy ditches
it, takes off. So I went.

65
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:24,166
I cornered him,
I drew my weapon,

66
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:27,000
and he made a move
for his waistband.

67
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:31,750
I saw a flash, I reacted,
I shot, and I killed him.

68
00:03:31,792 --> 00:03:35,041
And it turned out
he was unarmed, right?

69
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,625
Yeah. But the guy
just robbed a gas station.

70
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:41,417
With a gun. So I assumed that--
of course. Of course.

71
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,917
And now how do you feel?

72
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,500
Like I followed protocol.

73
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:47,875
That's not exactly
what I'm asking.

74
00:03:47,917 --> 00:03:51,041
What I'm asking is how you
feel about what happened.

75
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:53,625
Look, what I did?

76
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:55,041
It's part of the job.

77
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:58,125
Having to discharge your weapon
isn't usually part of the job.

78
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:02,917
Are you sleeping at night?

79
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,625
You know, I appreciate Joe,

80
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:08,458
you know, sending me
to somebody that he trusts.

81
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,667
But, um, I just--
I wanna get back to work.

82
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:16,750
That's tricky, getting back to
work after something like this.

83
00:04:16,792 --> 00:04:20,208
It can also put a lot
of stress on your home life.

84
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,041
How are things there?

85
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,834
You want me to say
that my home life sucks

86
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,959
because nobody else
gets me except other cops?

87
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,959
I wanna know how
you're handling it all.

88
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,583
Huh.

89
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:37,333
In my job, I see things.

90
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,458
Things that, um...

91
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,125
I can't describe them
to my wife.

92
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,542
And when I get home,

93
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:48,750
sometimes they're
still in my head.

94
00:04:48,792 --> 00:04:51,291
And you can't talk to anyone
at work about this, either?

95
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,667
You're not the first cop
I've dealt with.

96
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:55,709
I know what it's like.

97
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:59,000
So you can talk to me.

98
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,291
How you guys doing in here?

99
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:03,750
Give us a couple minutes?

100
00:05:03,792 --> 00:05:05,667
I'd love to, Shelly,
but I'm on the clock.

101
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:08,458
I gotta get this kid home,
so let's go.

102
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,792
Thanks, doc. Really.
Yeah.

103
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,041
Aaron and I were starting
to make progress.

104
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,041
Well, I appreciate you
stepping up here, Shelly.

105
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,083
These in-house counselors,

106
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,959
they're looking
to cover their own asses.

107
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm just not sure
he's ready to go back.

108
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,792
You don't get over
what he did in a week.

109
00:05:22,834 --> 00:05:24,125
He did his job.

110
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:27,750
No, he killed someone
in the course of doing his job.

111
00:05:27,792 --> 00:05:30,542
It's not the same thing.
A cop shoots an unarmed kid,

112
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:32,208
everyone
starts asking questions.

113
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,750
I'm less worried
about how it looks

114
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,041
than about where
his head's at.

115
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,291
Well, if you say so,
Shelly,

116
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,709
I'll make sure
he sees a therapist.

117
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,041
Heck, I'll even drive him
down here once a week,

118
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,625
after we restore him
to active duty.

119
00:05:43,667 --> 00:05:47,625
This ia investigation hasn't
wrapped, and they catch wind

120
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:49,959
of you not signing off
on this kid right away...

121
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,375
You get my drift?
I think so.

122
00:05:52,417 --> 00:05:54,375
You want me to say
it's all right for him

123
00:05:54,417 --> 00:05:56,542
to go back to work even though
I'm not comfortable with it.

124
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:59,250
I want you to help
the kid out.

125
00:06:11,417 --> 00:06:13,041
Dragon. D-r-a-g-o-n.

126
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,000
Dragon.
On fire.

127
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,250
Okay, Coop. Retrieval.
Okay, retrieval.

128
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,875
R-e-t-r-e-e--

129
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,792
Retrieval.
R-e-t-r-i-e-v-a-l.

130
00:06:26,834 --> 00:06:29,625
Gosh.
The new and undisputed

131
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:31,792
spelling champion
of the kitchen is Mason.

132
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,458
Milkshakes before noon?

133
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,041
It's a special flavor
Cooper made.

134
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:39,583
Marshmallow cream,
caramel syrup--

135
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:42,041
- No, no, no. Secret recipe.
- Secret recipe.

136
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,709
You've gotta try it.

137
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,250
Mm-hm.

138
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,041
It's sweet.
It's delicious.

139
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:55,417
- Delicious. D-e-l-i-s-h-o-o-s-h.
- Errh.

140
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:58,625
- Oh, my god! So sorry.
- Whoa.

141
00:06:58,667 --> 00:07:01,458
Aah.
Are you okay, mom?

142
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,709
Well, it looks like
she will keep her finger,

143
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,542
but your mom
might need stitches.

144
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:11,125
Stitches. S-t-i-t-c-h-e-s.
Stitches.

145
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:12,959
I'll do it.
You guys clean up.

146
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,333
Wah.

147
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,500
Sam wouldn't even smile
at me this morning.

148
00:07:20,542 --> 00:07:23,750
I saw him draw
his shades the other day.

149
00:07:23,792 --> 00:07:26,500
All of them.
Your lives are very intertwined.

150
00:07:26,542 --> 00:07:27,625
It's bound to be unpleasant.

151
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:30,041
Ugh. I just wish
I was sleeping.

152
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,208
When Pete first left,
I wasn't sleeping.

153
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,083
And then I started
sleeping sideways.

154
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,375
I don't know.
It was oddly comforting.

155
00:07:36,417 --> 00:07:38,041
What do you do
when the one person

156
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,250
who can make you
feel better

157
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:40,709
is the one person
who won't talk to you?

158
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,041
Hell if I know.
Unh. Unh.

159
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,500
You go to hell!
Ah, that must be my patient.

160
00:07:45,542 --> 00:07:48,041
- You're in the hospital.
- We're gonna take care of you.

161
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,125
Go to hell!
All of you go to hell!

162
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:53,041
I am not supposed to be here!
I have important people--

163
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:56,250
we found him on ocean Avenue. He
was yelling at a fire hydrant.

164
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:59,125
People are waiting to listen
to what I have to say.

165
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,500
That's enough.
It's okay, you can let him go.

166
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:03,667
Mr. Bauer. Sounds like
you're having a hard day.

167
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:06,500
I have a knife. I have
two knives. And I will stab

168
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:08,709
every person in here
who's looking at me right now.

169
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:12,083
I will stab you.
Mr. Bauer, you know better

170
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:15,083
than to talk that way.
You're scaring everybody.

171
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:18,041
What would your mother say if
she heard you talking that way?

172
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:21,000
Could I get ten milligrams
of haloperidol, please?

173
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,500
Don't you come near me.
Don't any of you come near me.

174
00:08:23,542 --> 00:08:25,542
I am the only one
that's gonna come near you.

175
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,834
Because I wanna help you.

176
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,583
Okay?

177
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:31,542
I know it's frustrating.

178
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,375
I know it's very confusing
being in here,

179
00:08:33,417 --> 00:08:35,041
but I'm gonna give you
some medicine

180
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,792
and you're gonna feel
much better soon.

181
00:08:36,834 --> 00:08:39,041
Okay?

182
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:42,208
Everybody else
is going back to work.

183
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,000
Here it is.

184
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,041
Can you do that yourself?

185
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,333
There you go.

186
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,542
Good. There you go.

187
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:54,750
Thank you. Thank you.

188
00:08:54,792 --> 00:08:56,667
Good job.

189
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:01,041
You're gonna feel
much better soon.

190
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,291
Good job.

191
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,417
Any weakness in your hand
before today?

192
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:10,542
It's just an old habit.

193
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,583
It's like a tick I picked up
in middle school.

194
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:16,625
And the glass? Seemed like
you couldn't grip it.

195
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:19,041
It was just wet.
It just slipped.

196
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,583
Have you been having
any headaches?

197
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,041
Dizziness?
I'm a single mom.

198
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,709
I work 50 hours a week.
I get headaches.

199
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:28,709
I'd be happy to check you out.
I appreciate it, but i--

200
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,291
you know,
I have my own doctor.

201
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:33,250
Who has probably never given
you a complete neuro workup.

202
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:35,041
We can get you over
to St. ambrose.

203
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,667
I could give you
an mri.

204
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:39,166
It would take an hour
or two, tops.

205
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,709
I don't have an hour.
You never know with these kind--

206
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,792
look, I know
it's what you do,

207
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:46,041
but I just don't like
being poked and prodded.

208
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:49,041
I didn't mean it like that.
No, it's cool.

209
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,000
Just let it go,
heh. Okay?

210
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:57,750
Done.
Great. Thank you.

211
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,458
Hi. Dr. Turner?
Hello.

212
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,500
I'm Scott Becker.

213
00:10:12,542 --> 00:10:14,667
I brought in the guy
you talked down yesterday.

214
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:17,500
Oh, yeah. Hi.
Hi.

215
00:10:17,542 --> 00:10:20,458
What you did for him, that was--
that was really impressive.

216
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,041
Thank you.

217
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,375
Yeah, I see a lot
of doctors here,

218
00:10:23,417 --> 00:10:27,583
but what you did was, um...

219
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,583
You're different.

220
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,458
I'm starting to sound
ridiculous,

221
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,500
so I was wondering
if you'd be interested

222
00:10:33,542 --> 00:10:36,041
in going out
with me sometime?

223
00:10:39,542 --> 00:10:42,500
That's very sweet.
That was a tiny bit patronizing.

224
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:44,583
Still, why don't you say yes?

225
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,041
I guarantee
you'll have a good time.

226
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,583
I am sure you're great,

227
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,667
but this is just not
the best time for me right now.

228
00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:52,709
But, um, thank you.
Really.

229
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,500
Hey, fellas.
Hey, Sam.

230
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:04,834
I heard about you and Addison.
I'm sorry, man.

231
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,583
Yeah.
You guys--?

232
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,000
We broke up.
Oh, man. You okay?

233
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,917
I'm fine. I'm fine.

234
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,792
It was amicable, adult.
It made sense.

235
00:11:14,834 --> 00:11:17,834
I had a dream last night
that I ran her over.

236
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:21,625
Flattened her.
Like in a cartoon.

237
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:24,041
That's adult.
You know, adult breakups

238
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,417
are myths perpetrated by women

239
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,625
so they can have their cake
and eat it too.

240
00:11:29,417 --> 00:11:33,583
The mature way to do things
is just untangle and move on.

241
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,542
Good luck selling your house
and finding a new job.

242
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:38,041
I've done this before, okay?
With Naomi.

243
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,375
She's my ex-wife.
She used to work here.

244
00:11:40,417 --> 00:11:41,417
How'd that work?

245
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:42,667
Got involved
with her best friend.

246
00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:43,875
Who? Addison?
Mm-hm.

247
00:11:43,917 --> 00:11:45,583
Oh, man, you are a glutton
for punishment.

248
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,625
The thing is we broke up over
a baby that doesn't even exist.

249
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:49,792
Is she even gonna have one?

250
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,333
- Mm-mm. You better ask her.
- Hey, hey, come on.

251
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:56,041
Right now this is a baby-free,
estrogen-free zone.

252
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:59,041
Look, I spent the whole weekend
just sitting around.

253
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:01,625
Sitting around.
We need to go out.

254
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:03,583
Let's go out.
It's not a bad idea.

255
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,500
Have some drinks.
Right. Some drinks.

256
00:12:05,542 --> 00:12:07,500
I won't talk about Violet.
Don't talk about Addison.

257
00:12:07,542 --> 00:12:09,041
You don't talk about babies.

258
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,667
Done.
All right. Bring it in.

259
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:17,250
I guess I'm just
a little bit excited.

260
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:21,500
Look, maybe the glass did
just slip out of Erica's hand,

261
00:12:21,542 --> 00:12:23,417
but she was flexing it earlier
as if it were weak.

262
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,709
And?
And when I tracked her eyes,

263
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,417
the right one was lagging
behind the left.

264
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,583
These are serious
neurological symptoms.

265
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:32,041
It could be a lacunar infarct,
onset of Ms.

266
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,583
Is there a reason

267
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,750
you're having this conversation
with me instead of her?

268
00:12:35,792 --> 00:12:38,250
I offered to do a workup.
She shot me down.

269
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:41,041
Maybe Cooper can convince her?

270
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,750
Telling Cooper
will only have him jump

271
00:12:42,792 --> 00:12:44,125
to the worst possible
conclusion.

272
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,667
So you just wanna turn
a blind eye to this

273
00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:47,667
and hope that nothing
serious is going on?

274
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:50,333
That's your call.
But if Erica strokes out

275
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,083
and drives Mason off the side
of the pch,

276
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,583
what do you think
you'll tell Cooper then?

277
00:12:56,792 --> 00:12:58,625
He shot and killed a man.
He's a good kid.

278
00:12:58,667 --> 00:12:59,834
I'm not making a value judgment,

279
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,709
I'm just saying he couldn't
possibly be ready

280
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,750
to go back to work.

281
00:13:02,792 --> 00:13:04,041
If every cop with PTSD
was benched,

282
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,959
there wouldn't be
any police left.

283
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,542
Well, strip all
of that away, okay?

284
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:10,041
Joe asking you the favor,
the fact Aaron is on the force,

285
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,083
what would you do?
I'd want him to get some help,

286
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,709
work through the trauma.

287
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:17,542
Exactly. You have an opportunity
to step up for Aaron

288
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,041
in a situation where he might
not be able

289
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,333
to step up for himself.

290
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,125
Or I could push the point,
keep him off the force,

291
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,375
and destroy his career.

292
00:13:23,417 --> 00:13:25,083
That's what your buddy
wants you to believe.

293
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,125
I've been around enough cops
to know he's right.

294
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:29,792
So you just check the box,
you put Aaron out on the street,

295
00:13:29,834 --> 00:13:31,583
and hope he's stable
enough to keep it together?

296
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,375
Joe said he'd make sure
he gets some help.

297
00:13:33,417 --> 00:13:36,458
Ah. Does the police department
seem like the kind of place

298
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,875
where therapy's encouraged?

299
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:40,583
Look, Violet, with all due
respect, I'm not being naive.

300
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,333
Okay? But I know Joe.

301
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:43,583
And I have to make a choice:

302
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,750
I trust him
or I put the kid in a position

303
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:48,208
where he could lose everything.
Shouldn't you be asking

304
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,625
if the kid loses more
by going back to work too soon?

305
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,041
Not gonna do this. It's lying.
Okay.

306
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,041
It is.
And I just busted Cooper's butt

307
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,041
over doing something like this.
Yeah, you did.

308
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,291
Not to mention that the
patient specifically said

309
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,625
she did not want this
to happen,

310
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:06,959
which makes it against
the law and unethical.

311
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,750
Why do I feel
like there's a "but" coming?

312
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:21,250
This is Dr. Charlotte king. I'm
chief of staff at St. ambrose.

313
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:26,041
We have a patient, Erica Warner,
who just arrived in our er.

314
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,750
She was seen in your clinic
a few months ago.

315
00:14:27,792 --> 00:14:30,542
We need her medical records.

316
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:31,792
No, not everything,

317
00:14:31,834 --> 00:14:36,834
just her most recent
head ct and mri would be useful.

318
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,542
She's in a medically induced
coma, no next of kin,

319
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:42,667
so you're gonna have to wait
on the consent forms.

320
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:45,041
Look, we can debate this
or we can do the right thing

321
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,083
and save this woman's life.

322
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:51,667
Courier's fine. Thank you.

323
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,291
I was completely clear,

324
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:05,250
completely clear with Addison
that I did not want a kid.

325
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:06,875
Were you expecting her
to give up?

326
00:15:06,917 --> 00:15:08,625
Hey. No Violet. No Addison.
No babies. Shh.

327
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:10,917
All right.
Look, Sam was a good soldier

328
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,375
and we just-- we know what
happens to the good soldiers.

329
00:15:13,417 --> 00:15:15,458
- Yeah. What?
- What's that?

330
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,917
- They-- uh--
- Ha-ha-ha.

331
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:19,458
They go missing.

332
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,458
Good soldiers go missing,

333
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,041
and then their brothers
have to go and get them.

334
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,750
I need another drink.
What is going on?

335
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:27,625
Yeah, like Sam needs
another office romance.

336
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:31,542
- Well, you know how-- hey. Ahem.
- Hey.

337
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,500
I've been looking for a drink,
she goes right to Jake.

338
00:15:33,542 --> 00:15:35,542
Can I get you anything?
No, I'm fine right now.

339
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:38,041
Well, if you need anything...

340
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:41,667
I-- no, I need something.

341
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:44,041
Impressive.
Actually, she was.

342
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,041
Oh.

343
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,709
For real?
Really? Really?

344
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,041
I gotta have a life outside of
work.

345
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,625
Apparently.

346
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:51,667
We need to hang out
with this guy more.

347
00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:54,458
Okay, okay. I'm a married man,
but I'm just saying,

348
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,792
that pretty young lady
over there just smiled at me.

349
00:15:56,834 --> 00:15:59,500
All right.
Oh, no, no.

350
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:02,083
- She's looking at Sam.
- Mm...

351
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,250
Oh.

352
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,917
Yes. She most definitely was.

353
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:07,375
Yes.

354
00:16:07,417 --> 00:16:08,792
I think I'm gonna
go over there.

355
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:11,375
Really?
Yeah. Why? Why not?

356
00:16:11,417 --> 00:16:13,500
You haven't picked up a girl
since middle school.

357
00:16:13,542 --> 00:16:17,041
Oh, come on. I'm sure
it's just like riding a bike.

358
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,500
Don't tell her you
just learned last year.

359
00:16:19,542 --> 00:16:21,583
My brothers, let's mock him
on the way out of battle,

360
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,166
not on the way in.
Okay.

361
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,041
Thank you. I think
I'm gonna be fine.

362
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,792
Go get them.

363
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,583
Who's gonna get
the next round?

364
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,625
I guess it's me.

365
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:45,041
Hi.
Hi.

366
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,959
You drinking bourbon?
Rye.

367
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,291
You drink rye on the rocks?
It's an old-fashioned.

368
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,834
Oh. Doesn't that usually have,
like, a cherry in it?

369
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,583
If you're a teenage girl

370
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:56,333
or you take pride
in sullying classic drinks.

371
00:16:56,375 --> 00:17:00,041
Maybe I'll try one.
Don't. They're serving swill.

372
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:04,625
I'm in from out of town on
a conference. Wanted to go out.

373
00:17:04,667 --> 00:17:06,458
And I'm already regretting it.

374
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,667
Yeah, this really
isn't my kind of place, either.

375
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:11,041
So, what kind
of place do you like?

376
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:14,041
Quiet. Good music.

377
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,750
And a great cocktail.

378
00:17:16,792 --> 00:17:18,875
Those places do exist
in L.A.

379
00:17:18,917 --> 00:17:21,000
Mm.
If you have time.

380
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,041
Well, how about my room?

381
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:27,041
It's quiet,
I have great music,

382
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,000
and I have a killer
bottle of bourbon.

383
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,875
Unless, of course, you're

384
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:33,834
a cherry-in-the-old-fashioned
kind of guy.

385
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:40,834
Are you really a doctor?
Yes, I am.

386
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,834
What kind?
I'm a heart surgeon.

387
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,500
Oh. The last guy I met

388
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:46,291
said he was a big
television producer.

389
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,041
Okay.
Turns out that he's the guy

390
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,875
who got the writers
their frappuccinos.

391
00:17:51,709 --> 00:17:53,625
So...
Well, I don't know.

392
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:55,083
How do you want me
to prove it?

393
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:57,417
How can I prove it
to you?

394
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:02,875
What muscle is this? Ha-ha-ha.
Ha, ha.

395
00:18:02,917 --> 00:18:06,041
Yes.
Well, that is the bicep brachii.

396
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,667
Good.
Mm-hm.

397
00:18:07,709 --> 00:18:10,417
There we have the
pectoralis major.

398
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:11,750
Uh-huh.

399
00:18:11,792 --> 00:18:16,458
And down there, we have
the transverse abdominis.

400
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,041
I could play
this game all night.

401
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:20,041
Right. Me too.

402
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,041
I mean, I actually know
all of the names

403
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:24,500
of all the muscles, so...

404
00:18:24,542 --> 00:18:26,542
That was too much, wasn't it?
Yeah.

405
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:29,041
I know, it felt weird
coming out of my mouth.

406
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:07,083
Wasn't that our floor?

407
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,041
Mm.

408
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:32,291
Whew. You're hot, you cook,
are you married?

409
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,500
No.
Ha, ha.

410
00:19:34,542 --> 00:19:36,208
You wanna get married,

411
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,792
or could we just pretend
it's our honeymoon all morning?

412
00:19:40,667 --> 00:19:42,583
I was kidding about the married.
Ha, ha.

413
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:43,959
Oh, no, I knew that.
I know.

414
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,166
I should probably
get going to work.

415
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,500
Do you wanna
hang out again?

416
00:19:47,542 --> 00:19:50,041
Yeah.

417
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:53,000
Yeah.

418
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,834
No.

419
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:58,208
So, what? You are married?

420
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,458
No, i'm-- I just...

421
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,458
I just got out of something.
Ahem.

422
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,792
And you're stuck on her?

423
00:20:05,834 --> 00:20:09,625
She is stuck in my head.
I'm not stuck.

424
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:13,000
You know, I'm not the guy that
just leaves without calling.

425
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:16,458
I mean, I always call.
I've always called.

426
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,583
But I just--
you seem really great.

427
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:25,041
And I just-- I kind
of wanna know,

428
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:28,458
you know, what would happen
if I decided to

429
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,083
do things different
than I've always done.

430
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:34,041
Because what I've always done

431
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,667
doesn't seem to work.

432
00:20:36,917 --> 00:20:39,500
Again, it's too much.

433
00:20:43,917 --> 00:20:46,917
I have something on my mind.

434
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:51,709
Me too.
You first.

435
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,500
No, you go.

436
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:58,542
Ahem. Am I like...? Um...

437
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:03,041
If I wasn't your husband
and you saw me at a bar,

438
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,083
would you hit on me?

439
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,542
Ow. I'm serious.

440
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:07,917
Let me guess.

441
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:11,083
The bachelors' night with
the boys got you all nostalgic?

442
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:15,959
I do not miss being a bachelor
and I love being married.

443
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,667
There was a lot of attention
being doled out,

444
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:19,500
and none of it
was coming my way.

445
00:21:19,542 --> 00:21:21,333
Do I not give you
enough attention?

446
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,709
That's not the point.

447
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,583
What is the point?

448
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,667
I'm not sure.

449
00:21:28,709 --> 00:21:30,750
Cooper, you are
a handsome man,

450
00:21:30,792 --> 00:21:32,792
and if you didn't have
a ring on your finger,

451
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:36,083
you'd have to beat
those hussies off with a stick.

452
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:41,375
Thank you.
Hmm.

453
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,041
Would you have sex
with me?

454
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:48,000
I am not one of those hussies.
Damn it.

455
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:53,125
You think we have enough space
in the loft?

456
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:54,458
What do you mean?

457
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,041
Mason's been spending
a lot of time there

458
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,583
and I was thinking
he may want it to be

459
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,667
more than just a weekend
thing at some point.

460
00:22:01,709 --> 00:22:05,041
I was looking on the Internet
and there are these partitions

461
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,583
we could install
in the living room maybe.

462
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,375
We could build Mason his own
man cave. He would love that.

463
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:18,000
So you're pretty into Mason
these days--

464
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:26,917
Are you feeling
like a hussy now?

465
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:29,208
Don't push your luck.

466
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:34,750
We've gotten threats.

467
00:22:34,792 --> 00:22:36,625
The stuff in the papers?

468
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:38,208
Everyone's trying
to twist this around

469
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,125
like Aaron's
some rogue cop.

470
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:41,667
That must be hard.
Yeah.

471
00:22:41,709 --> 00:22:45,041
We'll be fine.

472
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:47,542
Do you wanna know what he did
that day before the shooting?

473
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:50,583
He drove a kid from corner
to corner to find his mom

474
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:53,417
because she left in the middle
of the night to buy drugs.

475
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:55,542
That didn't make the papers.

476
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:58,041
He's a good man.

477
00:22:58,083 --> 00:23:01,250
He doesn't deserve this.
No, sissy. Can you, um...?

478
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:06,959
I need a moment alone
with Dr. Wallace, okay?

479
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,667
Okay.

480
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:23,875
So...

481
00:23:24,917 --> 00:23:26,792
What have you decided?

482
00:23:28,959 --> 00:23:31,458
I'm sorry. I don't think you're
ready to be back on the street.

483
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,291
I am ready.

484
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:38,041
I am. Please let me
get back to work.

485
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,500
It must feel like the whole
world is watching you,

486
00:23:40,542 --> 00:23:43,625
maybe even against you,
but you can't worry about sissy

487
00:23:43,667 --> 00:23:45,208
or Joe or anyone else.

488
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,542
You've had a major trauma,
and I think it's important

489
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:49,041
that we continue
to talk about it.

490
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:52,208
No, no, no.
You don't understand.

491
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:57,041
You know, growing up, the cops
in my neighborhood were jerks.

492
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:59,667
Just because they could be.

493
00:23:59,709 --> 00:24:02,458
You know? And I thought...

494
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:04,959
I thought I could be
a better cop.

495
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,542
A better person
than that.

496
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:12,291
See, I don't know how to sit
around my house.

497
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:15,041
I know how to be a cop.

498
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:17,750
Okay, I wanna get you to the
point where you can do your job

499
00:24:17,792 --> 00:24:20,125
and still have a healthy outlet
for your emotions.

500
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:22,166
How is that possible?

501
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:24,500
Without work to keep my focus,

502
00:24:24,542 --> 00:24:27,583
all I do is sit around
and I replay that night.

503
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:30,959
And, uh...

504
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,000
And what do you see?

505
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:42,458
I see his face.
That's natural.

506
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,458
You didn't have a choice.

507
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,250
It's okay to let yourself
off the hook, Aaron.

508
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:49,834
Is it?

509
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:53,000
You can talk to me.

510
00:24:57,959 --> 00:25:01,291
I see his face,
Dr. Wallace.

511
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:06,417
It was dark.
There was a shadow.

512
00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:09,625
I got spooked.

513
00:25:11,542 --> 00:25:15,166
And when I opened my eyes,
he was on the ground.

514
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:21,166
And I told the investigators
he reached, but, uh...

515
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:28,000
It's okay.

516
00:25:30,709 --> 00:25:32,709
I was scared.

517
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:37,792
I was scared.

518
00:25:37,834 --> 00:25:42,000
And now I can't get
his face out of my head.

519
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:46,000
I am sorry.

520
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:51,041
I am so, so sorry.

521
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:08,709
I just spent two hours
on the phone

522
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,375
trying to convince Aaron
not to quit.

523
00:26:10,417 --> 00:26:13,458
I said I needed more time
with him.

524
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,500
Shut the door.

525
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:22,291
I thought you'd do right
by him.

526
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:24,041
You thought
I'd rubber stamp him.

527
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,875
You knew that his story
was bogus.

528
00:26:30,583 --> 00:26:34,500
This guy Aaron shot?
He was 19 years old.

529
00:26:34,542 --> 00:26:36,250
But you probably read that,
right?

530
00:26:36,291 --> 00:26:37,667
You know what
you didn't read?

531
00:26:37,709 --> 00:26:40,291
The first time he comes
into the system, he's 11.

532
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:42,750
Beats up an old man
at a bus stop for $9.

533
00:26:42,792 --> 00:26:45,041
Nine bucks, Shelly.
Three years in juvie,

534
00:26:45,083 --> 00:26:48,041
where he distinguished himself
by his ability to make shanks.

535
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:49,500
He almost killed a kid
in there.

536
00:26:49,542 --> 00:26:51,542
Now six weeks after he finally
gets out,

537
00:26:51,583 --> 00:26:54,041
he robs a liquor store.
The list goes on.

538
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:56,041
You think that justifies
my lying to protect Aaron?

539
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:58,500
You think you're protecting him
by keeping him off the street?

540
00:26:58,542 --> 00:27:00,041
I'm telling you,

541
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:02,291
the only way this kid makes it
is by putting on his uniform

542
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:04,500
and getting back out there.
No, you are wrong, Joe.

543
00:27:04,542 --> 00:27:06,000
He is not doing well.

544
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:09,792
None of us are doing well,
Shelly. That's the joke.

545
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:16,542
It's a brutal job,
and we do the best we can.

546
00:27:16,583 --> 00:27:19,166
But if we were to stop
and think about what we do

547
00:27:19,208 --> 00:27:22,083
and why and try
to make some sense of it,

548
00:27:22,125 --> 00:27:24,542
you'd have a line of us
outside your door a mile long.

549
00:27:24,583 --> 00:27:27,875
Well, then maybe
I should have a line.

550
00:27:27,917 --> 00:27:30,917
Aaron doesn't go back
to work until I say so.

551
00:27:39,583 --> 00:27:42,709
What am I looking at?
A gliosarcoma.

552
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,709
Neuro docs
go their entire careers

553
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:45,917
without ever seeing
one of these,

554
00:27:45,959 --> 00:27:47,625
and I sniffed it out
while suturing a hand.

555
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:50,333
Well, congratulations.
What does it mean?

556
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:52,583
These things are nasty.
They are the only tumor

557
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:54,959
that can actually push out
of the brain through the skull.

558
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,583
If the cells come into contact
with any other part of the body,

559
00:27:57,625 --> 00:28:00,291
the tumor grows there,
making them nearly inoperable.

560
00:28:01,667 --> 00:28:02,875
How long?

561
00:28:04,125 --> 00:28:06,041
I'd need updated scans
to be sure,

562
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:07,333
but we're talking
a few months.

563
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:12,250
This specialist
gives her six to nine.

564
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:15,834
Is there anything
you can do?

565
00:28:19,667 --> 00:28:20,792
No.

566
00:28:37,667 --> 00:28:39,667
Hey.
Hey.

567
00:28:39,709 --> 00:28:40,583
I called you last night.

568
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:42,041
You left bonky bear
at your place.

569
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:43,250
I know. I saw.

570
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:45,458
I was out with, uh--
Jake and Cooper.

571
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,250
We were trying to get Sam's
mind off of Addison.

572
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:49,500
Mm. How did that go?

573
00:28:49,542 --> 00:28:51,667
It's Sam. I mean...
I know.

574
00:28:51,709 --> 00:28:54,709
Addison is not a bastion of
mental health these days either.

575
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,041
The next two people who get
together at this practice--

576
00:28:57,083 --> 00:28:59,166
should be fired
immediately.

577
00:29:01,834 --> 00:29:03,625
So how was it?
What do you mean?

578
00:29:03,667 --> 00:29:05,583
Last night.
The boys' night out.

579
00:29:05,625 --> 00:29:08,709
Oh. Oh, it was good.
Fun. Yeah.

580
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:12,458
What?
What did you think I meant?

581
00:29:13,667 --> 00:29:15,291
Nothing.

582
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:16,458
What did you do
last night?

583
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,959
Violet, that's--
no, no, no. What?

584
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,667
Were you with someone?

585
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Oh, god, you were with someone.

586
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,750
Oh, wow.

587
00:29:29,792 --> 00:29:32,041
Go ahead.

588
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:34,041
With what?
With your objection to me seeing

589
00:29:34,083 --> 00:29:35,542
other people
while we're separated.

590
00:29:35,583 --> 00:29:36,542
How old was she?

591
00:29:36,583 --> 00:29:37,709
Violet--
no, really.

592
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,834
Was she a waitress or a girl
that goes to the club--

593
00:29:39,875 --> 00:29:42,250
stop deflecting.
I'm not deflecting.

594
00:29:42,291 --> 00:29:45,458
Congratulations on your--
whatever it was.

595
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:48,917
So you're okay
if I see other people?

596
00:29:48,959 --> 00:29:51,250
We're separated, right?

597
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,750
Okay. I'll bring back
bonky bear tonight.

598
00:29:56,792 --> 00:29:58,083
Okay.

599
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:38,709
Did you know the guys
went out last night?

600
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,500
Really?

601
00:30:39,542 --> 00:30:42,041
So Sam could get
his mind off you.

602
00:30:42,083 --> 00:30:43,583
That's why
he didn't come home.

603
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:45,959
I was up all night again.

604
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,500
I did not hear the garage open,
I did not see the lights go on.

605
00:30:48,542 --> 00:30:50,709
I feel like Pete
is using this separation

606
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,583
to have the bachelor party
that he never had.

607
00:30:52,625 --> 00:30:56,709
You know, he wants
to sow his wild, old oats.

608
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:59,000
He told you that?
Yeah.

609
00:30:59,041 --> 00:31:01,917
I pretended not to care.
Do you?

610
00:31:04,083 --> 00:31:06,208
Well, I don't want to.
I mean, intellectually,

611
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:09,625
I understand where Pete
is coming from, but emotionally,

612
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:12,583
I haven't processed him
being with other women yet.

613
00:31:12,625 --> 00:31:14,166
Does he think our marriage
is over?

614
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:16,417
Maybe he has a different idea
of what separation is.

615
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,667
You know?
You prefer sleeping sideways.

616
00:31:18,709 --> 00:31:22,750
He prefers sowing
his wild, old oats.

617
00:31:22,792 --> 00:31:25,792
Look, a part of me hopes
that Sam moves on.

618
00:31:25,834 --> 00:31:28,000
You know? I mean, I wonder

619
00:31:28,041 --> 00:31:32,250
if I held him hostage, you know,
with all the baby stuff.

620
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:35,542
You're trying to be happy.
Maybe Pete is too.

621
00:31:39,417 --> 00:31:42,041
Hey. What's up?

622
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:43,667
I know about the tumor.

623
00:31:43,709 --> 00:31:45,083
What?
I know.

624
00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:48,208
How?
I just-- I know.

625
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:50,166
You've no idea
what you're talking about.

626
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:51,917
I do.

627
00:31:51,959 --> 00:31:55,709
You need help.
No, what I need

628
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:59,041
is time, and I'm not
gonna waste it

629
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,125
chasing some cure
that doesn't exist.

630
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:02,667
You have to tell Cooper.

631
00:32:04,166 --> 00:32:06,625
I don't have control
over this thing,

632
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:09,041
but I have control over
when I tell Mason

633
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:11,041
and destroy his childhood.

634
00:32:11,083 --> 00:32:12,750
He won't say anything.
He won't have to.

635
00:32:12,792 --> 00:32:14,208
He'll just look at him

636
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:16,875
like a kid whose mom
is dying and Mason will know.

637
00:32:16,917 --> 00:32:20,250
Look, I understand that.
I do.

638
00:32:20,291 --> 00:32:22,041
But you are family
to Cooper now.

639
00:32:22,083 --> 00:32:24,291
He needs time to prepare.
You need to listen to me.

640
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:25,834
You're gonna keep
your mouth shut.

641
00:32:25,875 --> 00:32:28,041
Because if you mention one word
of this to Cooper,

642
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:30,041
I will take my son
and disappear,

643
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:32,291
and Cooper will
never see him again.

644
00:32:45,083 --> 00:32:46,792
Nice.

645
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,333
Nice.

646
00:32:50,375 --> 00:32:52,500
Hey, come here. Ahem.

647
00:32:52,542 --> 00:32:54,041
Put your two fingers
over the seam

648
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:55,583
and let your wrist
roll over it.

649
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:57,583
Got it, dad.

650
00:32:57,625 --> 00:33:00,625
Teaching him the curve, huh?
Yeah.

651
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:04,000
Used to be enough to take
my mind off of things.

652
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:06,041
Yeah, well, silence
has a way of eating at you

653
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:08,125
until there's nothing left.

654
00:33:08,166 --> 00:33:09,875
I think what
you need to consider

655
00:33:09,917 --> 00:33:11,709
is whether you can keep
this one inside

656
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:14,625
and still be the man
and the cop that you wanna be.

657
00:33:14,667 --> 00:33:18,000
If I rat myself out,
I'll be letting everyone down.

658
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:21,166
Look, Joe would never
talk to me again.

659
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:23,709
Yeah, maybe.

660
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,583
My father
was a brilliant surgeon,

661
00:33:25,625 --> 00:33:26,625
one of the best in his field.

662
00:33:26,667 --> 00:33:29,583
And I wanted to be that too.
For him.

663
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:31,750
But I failed in the worst
possible way.

664
00:33:31,792 --> 00:33:33,583
Imagine trying
to be a world-class surgeon

665
00:33:33,625 --> 00:33:36,709
when you can't stomach
the sight of blood.

666
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:39,041
Coming to terms with the fact
I wasn't gonna be the person

667
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:43,542
he wanted me to be, it was hard,
I won't lie to you.

668
00:33:43,583 --> 00:33:46,041
But I'm better for it.

669
00:33:46,083 --> 00:33:48,959
Yeah, well, I wouldn't know
how to do that.

670
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,041
Well, I do. If I don't sign off
on your psych eval,

671
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:53,250
you're off the force.

672
00:33:53,291 --> 00:33:55,000
At least for a while.

673
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:59,125
It'll make getting back on very
difficult. Maybe impossible.

674
00:33:59,166 --> 00:34:01,834
But if I do it

675
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:03,959
it's not the best way.

676
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,333
Because at the end of the day,

677
00:34:05,375 --> 00:34:06,875
you're the one
who has to live with it.

678
00:34:17,709 --> 00:34:20,041
You still sulking?

679
00:34:20,083 --> 00:34:22,083
I'm not sulking.

680
00:34:22,125 --> 00:34:24,041
Too much energy.

681
00:34:24,083 --> 00:34:28,208
I am too far past exhaustion
to sulk.

682
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:31,000
Looks like sulking from here.
You know what you are?

683
00:34:31,041 --> 00:34:32,917
You're a peddler.

684
00:34:32,959 --> 00:34:35,792
A baby peddler. It is.
Is that right?

685
00:34:35,834 --> 00:34:39,667
And you're probably here to give
me some sort of pep talk where,

686
00:34:39,709 --> 00:34:42,041
to summarize, you'll tell me
to get back on the horse.

687
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:45,041
You're a peddler.
Ha, ha.

688
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,667
Are you getting back together
with Sam?

689
00:34:47,709 --> 00:34:49,834
Why would you ask that?

690
00:34:49,875 --> 00:34:52,542
Well, you gave Sam up
because you wanted a baby,

691
00:34:52,583 --> 00:34:54,083
and if you're not
getting back together,

692
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:57,208
then a baby is still
what you want.

693
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:58,834
Give me your hand.
What?

694
00:34:58,875 --> 00:35:01,041
Until you have a baby,
I consider you my patient.

695
00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:04,125
Give me your hand.
Okay.

696
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:10,041
I have heard every word
of this before.

697
00:35:10,083 --> 00:35:13,041
And I have told women when
it's time to throw in the towel.

698
00:35:13,083 --> 00:35:17,709
And you are not there yet.
You're not even close.

699
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,834
If you want this,
we can make this happen.

700
00:35:19,875 --> 00:35:22,709
I know you felt alone
in this before,

701
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,250
but you don't need
to feel that way anymore,

702
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:26,041
because you've got me.

703
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:28,834
I will always be there,
Addison.

704
00:35:31,834 --> 00:35:34,125
You say that
to all your patients?

705
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:37,709
Not all of it.

706
00:35:50,083 --> 00:35:55,333
I just almost
fell asleep.

707
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:11,500
You've got some balls.

708
00:36:11,542 --> 00:36:12,917
I came for Aaron.

709
00:36:12,959 --> 00:36:15,125
Well, you've already
done enough for him.

710
00:36:15,166 --> 00:36:17,166
He's giving himself up.
Know what that means?

711
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:19,792
If he's lucky enough
to somehow avoid prison,

712
00:36:19,834 --> 00:36:21,542
he loses his badge,
his pension,

713
00:36:21,583 --> 00:36:23,000
and everything
he's ever worked for.

714
00:36:23,041 --> 00:36:25,208
He'll be lucky to wind up
flipping burgers

715
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:28,750
at some fast-food joint.
You screwed him.

716
00:36:28,792 --> 00:36:31,041
And you screwed me.
We've been friends a long time.

717
00:36:31,083 --> 00:36:33,583
Not anymore. The next time
you need a cop, don't call me.

718
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:36,709
This is the right thing to do,
whether you see it now or not.

719
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:51,041
You stealing supplies?
Oh, hey.

720
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:53,333
What are you doing here?

721
00:36:53,375 --> 00:36:57,041
I-- ha, ha. I was gonna say that
I was here to see Mr. Bauer,

722
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:59,041
but really I was hoping
to find you.

723
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:01,458
That's very sweet.

724
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,458
I'm assuming you're
not being patronizing.

725
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,041
Mm-mm.

726
00:37:05,083 --> 00:37:07,625
Um, I was wondering,
is it too late

727
00:37:07,667 --> 00:37:09,041
for me to take you
up on your offer?

728
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:12,417
Um, I need to finish
stealing supplies

729
00:37:12,458 --> 00:37:14,917
for my rig
and take a shower.

730
00:37:14,959 --> 00:37:18,208
Give me an hour?
All right.

731
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:30,458
Will you help me
find a surrogate?

732
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,000
Absolutely.

733
00:37:36,959 --> 00:37:38,625
So they really called you "bus"?

734
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:43,291
Um, my brother is older,
and he and his friends

735
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:45,667
used to play tackle football
out behind our house,

736
00:37:45,709 --> 00:37:47,333
and I always wanted to play,

737
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:51,041
as the younger brother,
but, you know, my mom said,

738
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:54,417
"you're too young
and you're gonna get hurt."

739
00:37:54,458 --> 00:37:59,834
So one day I went,
I put a bucket over my head

740
00:37:59,875 --> 00:38:01,750
and I just ran out
on the field

741
00:38:01,792 --> 00:38:03,500
and I said,
"I'm gonna bus them.

742
00:38:03,542 --> 00:38:05,041
I'm gonna bus them up."
Ha, ha.

743
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:08,834
And so the name "bus"
was born.

744
00:38:08,875 --> 00:38:12,000
I broke my collarbone
that day.

745
00:38:12,041 --> 00:38:14,625
Needed to have surgery.

746
00:38:17,291 --> 00:38:18,834
How old are you?

747
00:38:29,542 --> 00:38:31,542
I'm 29.

748
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:52,542
- Comrade. C-o-m-r-a-d-e.
- Comrade.

749
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:58,041
Did I get it?
Sorry.

750
00:38:58,083 --> 00:39:00,166
Uh, yeah.
Knocked you out again.

751
00:39:01,917 --> 00:39:03,959
All right. I don't think
I can take any more tonight.

752
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,041
Why don't you get washed up

753
00:39:05,083 --> 00:39:07,250
and we'll watch a little TV,
okay?

754
00:39:10,667 --> 00:39:12,000
What's going on
with you?

755
00:39:12,041 --> 00:39:16,041
Usually you love to watch me
get thrashed by an 8-year-old.

756
00:39:16,083 --> 00:39:19,000
I'm just... I'm tired.

757
00:39:20,583 --> 00:39:22,709
Charlotte,
what's wrong?

758
00:39:26,041 --> 00:39:28,875
I love you.
So do I.

759
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,875
Hey. Tonight's my night.

760
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:49,458
Yes, I just--

761
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,500
could we go somewhere to talk?
Just you and me?

762
00:40:04,083 --> 00:40:06,000
Where's my dad?

763
00:40:06,041 --> 00:40:07,500
Uh...

764
00:40:07,542 --> 00:40:10,166
He'll be back in a minute. Um...

765
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:11,667
You want another word?

766
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:14,083
Sure.

767
00:40:14,125 --> 00:40:15,667
Uh...

768
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:23,166
The word is acceptable.

769
00:40:23,208 --> 00:40:28,542
Acceptable. A-c-c-e-p-t-a-b-l-e.

770
00:40:28,583 --> 00:40:30,542
Acceptable.

771
00:40:48,083 --> 00:40:51,041
How have you been?
Okay.

772
00:40:51,083 --> 00:40:52,917
You?

773
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,083
I haven't been sleeping.

774
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:01,709
Me either.

775
00:41:03,166 --> 00:41:07,709
I mean, the winner was literally
hobbled by the end.

776
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:11,500
And he did this all for 50 bucks
and a boot filled with beer.

777
00:41:11,542 --> 00:41:15,583
I mean, the guy is either
a glutton for punishment

778
00:41:15,625 --> 00:41:18,583
or he just really likes
drinking beer out of a boot.

779
00:41:18,625 --> 00:41:20,750
Which do you think it was?

780
00:41:20,792 --> 00:41:24,667
I don't know. Ha, ha. Both.

781
00:41:24,709 --> 00:41:28,542
I guess if you want something
badly enough,

782
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:32,000
then maybe getting your shins
pummeled is a fair price.

783
00:41:33,583 --> 00:41:35,667
I want a baby.

784
00:41:37,208 --> 00:41:39,458
I'm gonna have a baby.
