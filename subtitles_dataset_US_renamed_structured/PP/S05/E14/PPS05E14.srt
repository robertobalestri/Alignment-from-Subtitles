You took all those classes

Yes. Heh.

7
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:23,250
My textbooks that fall
cost as much as a small car.

8
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:26,250
But I wanted to graduate
in three and a half years,

9
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:28,041
and I was interested
in all of them.

10
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:30,166
It sounds overwhelming.

11
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:33,959

Corinne?

00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:48,041
Corinne,
it's your brother.

14
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:50,166
Sam.
What do they have her on?

15
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:52,000
She was deranged
when she came in.

16
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:53,458
Shrink's got her
loaded up.

17
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:01,458
So...

18
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:05,500
It was actually...
It's actually a physical book?

19
00:01:05,542 --> 00:01:07,917
Yeah, yeah, with every
student's face in it.

20
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:11,041
Like a phone book?
No computer?

21
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:14,041
That's right,
young man.

22
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:16,917
Yeah, it was great.

23
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:19,041
You could look up
the cute guy

24
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:21,875
in your comparative
literature class

25
00:01:21,917 --> 00:01:24,875
and call him
when you were drunk.

26
00:01:24,917 --> 00:01:27,000
What cute guy?
How cute?

27
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:30,458
Not as cute as you.

28
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,208
I'm not cute. I'm tough.
You're cute.

29
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,250
I'm a tough guy.

30
00:01:38,917 --> 00:01:41,875
Sorry I called.
No, no, I'm glad you called.

31
00:01:41,917 --> 00:01:43,875
I'm--

32
00:01:43,917 --> 00:01:46,500
I'm sorry I don't have
any words of wisdom. I--

33
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:49,041
yeah.

34
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:52,875
Gosh, you look so sad.
You look like a little boy.

35
00:01:52,917 --> 00:01:55,458
It's 20 years,
Addison.

36
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,667
Just picked up
and left.

37
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:58,875
No goodbye. No--

38
00:01:58,917 --> 00:02:01,125
she was just gone.
I know.

39
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:03,500
I mean, I don't know. I
know what you told me.

40
00:02:03,542 --> 00:02:05,959
No call, no letter.

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,166
I thought she was dead.

42
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:09,041
Yeah, but it's good news,
right?

43
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:11,458
That she's not.
That she's back now.

44
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,208
Corinne.

45
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,041
Can I get you
something?

46
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:18,750
Thirsty.

47
00:02:19,917 --> 00:02:22,041
Hi, Corinne.
Um--

48
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,500
I'm Sam's neighbor.

49
00:02:24,542 --> 00:02:26,959
And we work together also.
I'm Addison.

50
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:36,000
Here's your water,
Corinne.

51
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:44,000
Here are your meds.
Want to take these for me?

52
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:02,208
I'm not so sure.

53
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:06,750
Not so sure...?
That this is good news.

54
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,583
He won't stop
screaming.

55
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,834
I know babies cry,
but it's been like 14 hours.

56
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,583
He won't eat.
He can't sleep.

57
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:17,375
Hyperactive reflexes,
increased muscle tone.

58
00:03:17,417 --> 00:03:19,250
He's tachypneic.
Pulse ox is borderline.

59
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,041
- Can't you give him something?
- We will.

60
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,834
After we diagnose
what the problem is.

61
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,458
Eli's pretty small for ten days.

62
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,792
Was he premature?

63
00:03:26,834 --> 00:03:29,583
Mm-hm.
How many weeks?

64
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:32,375
Um, like two?
Are you asking me?

65
00:03:32,417 --> 00:03:35,041
No, sorry.
It's just the screaming.

66
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,041
I haven't slept.
Two weeks.

67
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,583
He came two weeks early.

68
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,333
He looks malnourished
and dehydrated.

69
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:43,041
Is he eating?
Are you breast feeding?

70
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:45,875
No. Um, uh--
he likes the bottle.

71
00:03:45,917 --> 00:03:47,291
Pumping or formula?
Formula.

72
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,583
And why is that?

73
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:50,875
What?

74
00:03:50,917 --> 00:03:54,041
Uh, most mothers try
to breast feed for a while.

75
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,583
Was he having trouble
latching?

76
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,875
Why does it matter?
Just help him.

77
00:03:59,667 --> 00:04:04,000
You look good for someone
who gave birth ten days ago.

78
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,083
This isn't your baby,
is it?

79
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,875
Okay, you need to explain
what's going on right now,

80
00:04:21,917 --> 00:04:24,125
or we're going to security.

81
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,333
Okay.

82
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:28,625
Wait.

83
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:30,041
Uh, his mom...

84
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:33,041
My mom.
She's a druggie.

85
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,917
So Eli is your brother?

86
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,250
She gave birth to him,

87
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:39,041
brought him home
and then left to score.

88
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,458
He was two days old.

89
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,208
But it's been over a week,
and she hasn't come back.

90
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,208
Did you try to find her?
No, but--

91
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,458
do you know if she's okay?
I never know if she's okay.

92
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,500
The first time she left me,
I was 8.

93
00:04:50,542 --> 00:04:52,792
I woke up one morning,
went downstairs

94
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,125
and there was no one.

95
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,041
The house was empty.

96
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,709
I didn't know what to do
and I was scared,

97
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,959
but I didn't wanna be alone,
so I toasted a frozen waffle

98
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,959
and I got dressed
and I went to school.

99
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,375
She came back
a few days later.

100
00:05:06,417 --> 00:05:09,041
She said
she got stuck at work.

101
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:12,750
But she worked in some office,
and it didn't make any sense.

102
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:18,375
But then she acted normal,
so I did too. I just...

103
00:05:18,417 --> 00:05:20,291
I didn't want it
to happen again.

104
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,500
- But it did?
- Of course.

105
00:05:22,542 --> 00:05:24,625
Sometimes she would tell me
that she was leaving,

106
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:27,959
other times
she'd just be gone.

107
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,750
Eventually,
when it got really bad,

108
00:05:30,792 --> 00:05:33,083
one of my teachers
figured it out.

109
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:38,333
And that was the first time
I was put in foster care.

110
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:39,834
After that...

111
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:44,291
It was just
a lot of back and forth.

112
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,834
Eli doesn't deserve that.

113
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:50,375
He should have someone
who can take care of him.

114
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,125
Always.

115
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,166
And that can be me.

116
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,417
Hey.

117
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,417
How are you feeling?
Hey.

118
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,834
Ten minutes into
my first session of chemo.

119
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:11,834
Probably better
than anyone else in here.

120
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,417
You got the right attitude.

121
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:17,041
Do you want to bring Mason in?
No.

122
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:20,041
I don't want him to see me.

123
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:23,000
Or anyone else in here.

124
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:25,041
It'd just be
too much for him.

125
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,417
Okay.

126
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:30,250
If that's what you want.
It's what I want.

127
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,667
He's my little boy.

128
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:35,166
I've been the only constant
in his life.

129
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:40,291
So if this is scary for me,
then for him...

130
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:47,208
It's what I want.

131
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:53,041
Blank-o-o-blank
blank-i-blank-blank.

132
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,417
Come on.

133
00:06:55,458 --> 00:07:01,208
I don't know, e?
I already said there's no e's.

134
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:05,542
Can I please see my mom now?
In a few minutes. She's resting.

135
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:08,500
I really just wanna see my mom.
I know.

136
00:07:08,542 --> 00:07:09,750
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, man.

137
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:11,542
Hey, Mason.

138
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,458
So...

139
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,667
How's your, uh...?

140
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,625
Give me a minute, okay?

141
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:23,667
I'll give you a hint.
There's a k in there.

142
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,041
Mason doesn't know
about his mother?

143
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,041
No, Erica won't...

144
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,041
Doesn't want me
to say anything, you know.

145
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,875
I've gone along,
because he's just a kid,

146
00:07:33,917 --> 00:07:35,917
he's not ready to deal
with his mother's death.

147
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:37,083
I'm not ready
to deal with it.

148
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:40,041
Yeah. Losing a parent.
I know how hard that is.

149
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,375
At least he has
you and Charlotte.

150
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:42,667
Yeah. Yeah.

151
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:45,417
Mason. I'll see you later.

152
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:51,500
All right. Any ideas?

153
00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:53,375
Why's my mom
resting so much?

154
00:07:53,417 --> 00:07:55,083
She's still really tired
from the accident.

155
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,166
The last time I saw her,
she didn't look tired.

156
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:58,458
She looked fine.

157
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,041
Yeah, but--
I know she wants to see me.

158
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,458
And I really wanna
see her.

159
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,667
Please.

160
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:09,125
We just have to give her
a little more time.

161
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:17,583
Hey, can I ask you a favor?
You can ask.

162
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,417
I want you to take me off
the surgical rotation

163
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,500
for a couple of days.

164
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:24,291
I'm researching gliosarcomas
and I have a few leads,

165
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,542
but I need more time.

166
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,041
Erica agreed
to do the chemo.

167
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,125
Beyond that, I don't think
she's holding out any hope.

168
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:32,792
Which is realistic.
But I'm not ready to give up.

169
00:08:32,834 --> 00:08:35,041
What does that mean?
It means I need to keep reading

170
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,333
and talking
to more docs and...

171
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,166
I don't know where you find
miracles these days,

172
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,458
but I would like to try.

173
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,625
Okay.

174
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,041
You were right.

175
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,458
Baby Eli has neonatal
abstinence syndrome.

176
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,417
We should start
a methadone taper.

177
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:56,000
Unfortunately,
there's more.

178
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:59,041
He's also got a congenital
cystic adenomatoid malformation.

179
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,792
It needs to be removed, or
his lungs will be compromised.

180
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:04,041
You can't do surgery.
He's too weak.

181
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,583
Waiting carries its own risks.

182
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:09,041
Any little virus or cold,
he could become oxygen-deprived.

183
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,750
Who makes this call?

184
00:09:10,792 --> 00:09:12,542
Well, is there a father
in the picture?

185
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,625
No, just the baby's sister,
Denise.

186
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:16,041
How old is she?
Nineteen.

187
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,041
And she also went through hell
with the mother,

188
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:21,041
but she's trying to do right
by her brother.

189
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,500
You think she's qualified
to make that kind of decision?

190
00:09:23,542 --> 00:09:25,208
She doesn't have to.

191
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,000
This is Eli's mother,
Melissa.

192
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:37,041
Did I leave to score drugs
right after Eli was born?

193
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,917
Yes, I did.
But I changed my mind.

194
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:42,208
Oh. So where were you?
Getting clean.

195
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,041
You went to rehab?
No. I did it myself.

196
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,041
She locked herself
in a motel room for eight days

197
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,041
and detoxed cold Turkey.

198
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,250
That would've been great before
she got her fetus addicted.

199
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,041
- Okay, Cooper.
- You're right.

200
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,458
But I got clean.

201
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,875
You've been clean for,
what, eight days?

202
00:09:55,917 --> 00:09:58,542
You've been an addict for--
don't tell me about addiction.

203
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:01,250
I am trying for Eli.
I am doing everything I can.

204
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:03,125
Because I am gonna be
a good mother to him.

205
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,291
- You walked out on him.
- No, I didn't.

206
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:09,250
I left him with Denise.
And I called over and over.

207
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:12,041
Only Denise never answered,
and she never called me back.

208
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,291
So Denise is lying?

209
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,291
She has issues.

210
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,834
With me, all right?
And I know why.

211
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,667
Lots of times, I wasn't
any kind of mother to her.

212
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:22,959
But this is not
the same thing. It isn't.

213
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,041
I went to get clean.

214
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,041
It was miserable.
I...

215
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:31,375
Day after day, shaking
and sweating and wanting to die,

216
00:10:31,417 --> 00:10:33,709
but I did it for Eli
because he is my second chance,

217
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,125
and I am not gonna
screw this up.

218
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,542
How did you find her?

219
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,166
I called
her cell phone.

220
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,500
Okay, so what? She left
her newborn to get high.

221
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:44,709
But she didn't get high.

222
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,458
She got clean,
and that means something.

223
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,500
You know how hard it is
to detox cold Turkey.

224
00:10:48,542 --> 00:10:50,959
Yeah. And it was admirable
she was able to do it.

225
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,750
Does that mean she's able
to take care of Eli?

226
00:10:53,792 --> 00:10:55,166
Denise is.
She's a kid.

227
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,542
Really? Does Denise
have an apartment, a job,

228
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,542
somebody to help?
There are plenty of single,

229
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,583
competent teenaged mothers
in the world.

230
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:04,041
With a sick baby?
Okay, guys. You know what?

231
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,750
We're not gonna solve this.
We gotta call dcfs.

232
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:08,333
Melissa's better
than the system.

233
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:09,709
Denise is better
than Melissa.

234
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:13,041
I am calling
social services.

235
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,625
Hey.

236
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:23,542
How do you feel
about New Zealand?

237
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:27,750
Anything farther than
the bathroom seems intimidating.

238
00:11:27,792 --> 00:11:29,417
Why?
There's a doctor there

239
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,667
who's doing experimental
treatments on gliosarcomas.

240
00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:33,959
They're called
intracranial microcapsules,

241
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,041
which basically just means
they're these--

242
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,041
no.

243
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,750
Thank you, but no.

244
00:11:39,792 --> 00:11:43,417
I can't get on a plane
and fly halfway around the world

245
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:46,041
for whatever that is.

246
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,583
It might be nothing.
But it might be something.

247
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,041
And the point is,
we won't know

248
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:52,041
until we get on the ground
and really start--

249
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,667
Amelia, I agreed to do chemo.
I'm fighting.

250
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:57,875
I don't wanna do anything
to sacrifice time with Mason.

251
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:00,417
Especially getting on a plane
to fly somewhere

252
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,250
for someone to do surgery
on my brain.

253
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,792
A surgery
that I might not wake up from.

254
00:12:04,834 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm sorry, I can't.

255
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,291
Three times.

256
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,625
Three times?
Ugh, I hate you.

257
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:37,041
Yes, well,
I would hate me too. Ha, ha.

258
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,333
Look at you.

259
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,625
You're all
"Violet got her groove back."

260
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:43,041
Yes.
Who would've thought

261
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,917
my groove was in this
20-something paramedic

262
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,041
with these abs carved out
of marble and this back...

263
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,208
Oh my god, his back.
It's just like you ordered him.

264
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:53,291
Like you called a catalog and
asked for those specifications.

265
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,667
I want that catalog.
I've never done this before.

266
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:59,250
It's just sex. It's just
pure, mind-numbing sex.

267
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:02,834
Maybe guys are right. Maybe
"no strings attached" works.

268
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,333
Eh, every time
I sleep with someone,

269
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,041
we wind up
in a pit of despair.

270
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:09,041
Ha-ha-ha.
Together. Stuck.

271
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,625
Stop.
I'm serious.

272
00:13:10,667 --> 00:13:14,917
All this makes me miss Sam.
You miss Sam or you miss sex?

273
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,333
Both. You know,
the irony has been

274
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,542
that the harder I tried
to have a baby,

275
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,041
the less I actually had sex.

276
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,375
It's been months.

277
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:25,083
Which is probably
why I threw myself at Jake.

278
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,041
What?
Heh, heh. In palm Springs.

279
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:32,458
I drank a bunch of martinis,
and I wind up in his bed.

280
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,583
Addison.
He turned me down.

281
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:37,667
You know, which I respect.
And hate.

282
00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:40,500
Ugh. I miss Sam.

283
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,959
Lazy.
What?

284
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,625
Lazy. It's lazy.
It's more than lazy.

285
00:13:51,667 --> 00:13:53,333
You know, it's infuriating.
Sheldon.

286
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,542
She's stoned, Sam.

287
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,333
She's not medicated,
not even diagnosed.

288
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:01,041
I understand the pressure
the prison shrinks are under.

289
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,375
But your sister
is just stoned on a cocktail

290
00:14:03,417 --> 00:14:05,166
of anti-psychotics
and sedatives

291
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:10,542
that would leave a circus animal
glassy-eyed and affect-less.

292
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:15,542
Okay, look, there might be
a silver lining here, okay?

293
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:18,000
We don't know what Corinne
is like under all those meds.

294
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,000
And once we get her off them,
you might actually

295
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,166
be able to find your sister
in there somewhere.

296
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,583
You wanna take her off her meds?
Yeah.

297
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,667
The prison guard said
she was deranged.

298
00:14:26,709 --> 00:14:29,375
Deranged
is not a diagnosis.

299
00:14:29,417 --> 00:14:31,417
I just wanna get her
off the meds long enough

300
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:36,792
to see what's going on with her.
Okay? Can we do that?

301
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,041
Please.

302
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:40,041
Okay.

303
00:14:45,834 --> 00:14:48,625
So Sheldon
took her off her meds?

304
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:50,750
Yeah. Temporarily.

305
00:14:50,792 --> 00:14:53,000
Well, did she...?

306
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:55,417
Is she any different?

307
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:59,041
Uh, not much. Not yet.

308
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,041
Apparently they had her
pretty zonked out.

309
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm gonna have to wait
for it all to wear off,

310
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,709
but Sheldon canceled
all his patients.

311
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,083
Said he would
spend the day with her.

312
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:11,250
Try to make a real diagnosis.
And then what?

313
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,041
I don't know.

314
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:18,834
Uh... I just...

315
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,250
I don't know.

316
00:15:21,917 --> 00:15:23,458
Did you call your family?
Your mom?

317
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:28,834
No. I've been taking this thing,
like, a minute at a time.

318
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,709
I mean, I can't look ahead.
I just...

319
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,500
I don't know.

320
00:15:38,542 --> 00:15:41,542
It's not your job anymore,
you know?

321
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:45,333
To take care of him.
To worry about him.

322
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,041
He's my friend.

323
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,709
He'll be your friend
again someday,

324
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,041
but right now
he's mostly just your ex.

325
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,709
I mean, you still want
a baby, right?

326
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,041
I know you needed a break,
but has anything changed?

327
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:58,917
No. I still want a baby.

328
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,041
Then right now,
Sam is your ex.

329
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:04,291
You try to pretend
he's your friend and, uh...

330
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,250
And what?
And you hurt worse.

331
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,083
I know he's having
a tough time right now,

332
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,959
but he has
other friends and...

333
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,291
And I would hate to see
you hurt worse.

334
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:21,083
I gotta go
to the hospital.

335
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,917
I'm-- I'm putting
my foot down.

336
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:29,458
We're staying on the bed
next time.

337
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,041
Why?

338
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:34,542
I'm gonna die
from rug burn, that's why.

339
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,792
Why do we have
to lie down at all?

340
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:37,959
You're trouble.

341
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:42,792
Oh. You kids
got a hall pass?

342
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:49,166
I'm the only one
you have to worry about.

343
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:00,709
Should I...?

344
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:04,083
Um, if I brought him
in earlier, would he be okay?

345
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:07,166
Oh. Denise,
it is not your fault.

346
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,000
I just want to protect him.

347
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,041
I know you do.

348
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,875
Why are you here?
She wants to be with her baby.

349
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:17,041
Honey, mommy's here, Eli,

350
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,041
and I am never
leaving again, ever.

351
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,542
Liar.
You're a liar.

352
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,250
You're gonna do to him
what you did to me.

353
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,375
He is gonna end up like I did,
no.

354
00:17:25,417 --> 00:17:27,250
Bouncing around,
scared and alone.

355
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:30,000
I am clean now, okay?
You can't do this here.

356
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:32,208
Oh, right.
Until Eli cries

357
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,667
or you have a bad day at work
or some guy dumps you,

358
00:17:34,709 --> 00:17:36,041
that's all
it's gonna take.

359
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,208
Look, I will not let you
hurt him.

360
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,041
You are damaged
and you are bad--

361
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:43,500
I have a problem, okay?
You need to go outside.

362
00:17:43,542 --> 00:17:45,625
For the first time,
I have a reason to fix it.

363
00:17:45,667 --> 00:17:47,166
Oh, so I wasn't worth it?

364
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:49,875
Oh, my god. What is it?

365
00:17:49,917 --> 00:17:51,834
Get Dr. Montgomery.
What is happening?

366
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,417
Sats are dropping.
What does that mean?

367
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:54,834
He's having trouble breathing.

368
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,041
- Intubate.
- Don't. Don't.

369
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:58,458
He's not getting air.
We have to.

370
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,041
Intubating will increase
air-trapping into the lungs.

371
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,834
We need to get him
to the or now.

372
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,291
Dr. Freedman said he's not
strong enough for surgery.

373
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:09,041
Let them do their job.
You don't know.

374
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:11,834
The surgery might kill him,
but not doing surgery will.

375
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:14,709
Enough!
Move out of the way. Now!

376
00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:25,875
"I don't wanna die."

377
00:18:25,917 --> 00:18:27,083
"But you must die!"

378
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:31,875
All right, time for all monsters
to get off the table.

379
00:18:31,917 --> 00:18:34,041
Dinner is ready.

380
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:35,333
I'm not hungry.

381
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:36,875
I just wanna see my mom.

382
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:39,709
I made you Mac and cheese.
That's your favorite, right?

383
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,083
Charlotte, I really just
wanna see my mom.

384
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,917
I know you do.

385
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:45,834
But visiting hours are over
for tonight.

386
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,583
But you're in charge there,
you can take me.

387
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:52,166
Your mom's still resting.
She's not this tired.

388
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:55,041
Everyone keeps saying that,
but she's never this tired.

389
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,875
Tell me what you think
of the Mac and cheese.

390
00:18:56,917 --> 00:19:00,583
This isn't right.
It's not how my mom makes it.

391
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,291
Well, there's macaroni
and there's cheese.

392
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:07,208
I don't want this.
I want to see my mom.

393
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:15,041
I know you're upset
and you've been through a lot,

394
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,875
and you're worried
about your mom.

395
00:19:16,917 --> 00:19:19,959
But that does not mean
that you can act like...

396
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,583
Mason?

397
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,834
Mason.

398
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,000
Mason!

399
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,792
Thank you. How's Eli?

400
00:19:50,834 --> 00:19:52,333
Addison's still working on him.

401
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:56,583
Isolated the main bronchus,
but hasn't done the lobectomy.

402
00:19:56,625 --> 00:20:00,291
But that kid's a fighter.
I think he'll do okay.

403
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:07,750
Hey, man, I know we disagree
about Melissa and Denise,

404
00:20:07,792 --> 00:20:10,041
but let's not let it
become a thing, okay?

405
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,458
It's not a thing.

406
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:15,875
You sure?
I was just... look.

407
00:20:15,917 --> 00:20:17,542
My mind's on Eli,
I'm walking down the hall,

408
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,542
and I see Violet making out
with her boyfriend.

409
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,792
Oh.

410
00:20:20,834 --> 00:20:23,333
It's annoying.
Yeah, well...

411
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:25,458
Yeah, well, heh, what?

412
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,875
I mean, you guys
are separated, right?

413
00:20:27,917 --> 00:20:29,583
Doesn't mean I wanna
see her fooling around

414
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:32,375
with someone I have to work with
in my workplace.

415
00:20:32,417 --> 00:20:36,083
Heh. You might not want to, but
isn't that the next step?

416
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:38,000
I mean, you move on,
she moves on.

417
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:41,417
Okay. Let's just say
you and Charlotte split up,

418
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,917
she starts dating
some hot male nurse.

419
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:45,291
Ha-ha-ha.
Would you be cool with that

420
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,333
just because you had
a few nights of fun?

421
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,583
I don't know how I would feel.
Ha-ha-ha. Yes, you do.

422
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,291
Ah, speak of the devil.
Hello?

423
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,083
I turned my back
for one second, Coop.

424
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,709
One second,
and he was gone.

425
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,917
- What?
- Mason.

426
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:04,083
What? Where are you?
He ran out the front door,

427
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,875
and now I'm out
looking for him.

428
00:21:05,917 --> 00:21:07,917
How long has he been gone,
how far did he get?

429
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:10,834
I'm trying to figure that out.
Okay, I'm calling the police.

430
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:13,542
Give me five minutes.
If I can't find him, I'll call.

431
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:16,041
Are you feeling better?

432
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:17,792
Clearer?

433
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:23,208
A little.

434
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:26,166
Corinne, have you ever been
formally diagnosed?

435
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:30,250
Schizophrenic.

436
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,500
Manic-depressive.

437
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:35,959
Paranoid delusions.

438
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,041
Every jail,
every nuthouse,

439
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:44,000
a different shrink
had a different idea.

440
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:48,750
I'm thirsty.

441
00:21:48,792 --> 00:21:51,583
You're just coming down
off the haloperidol.

442
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:54,208
Here, have some water.

443
00:21:56,417 --> 00:21:59,500
Yeah, Sam, come in.
Okay. Hey, Corinne.

444
00:21:59,542 --> 00:22:02,041
Corinne has given me permission
to include you

445
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:04,291
and disclose
what she's sharing.

446
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:08,000
Isn't that right, Corinne?
Mm-hm. Sure.

447
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,542
- Bathroom?
- Sure, sure.

448
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:19,834
It's out the door, down the hall
on the right. Okay? Easy.

449
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:23,000
Yeah. Thank you.

450
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:37,041
I was wondering
what you remember.

451
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:39,417
You grew up with Corinne.

452
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:42,000
For purposes of diagnosis.

453
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:46,333
What I remember.

454
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:52,041
Uh, okay.
I remember her being,

455
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:53,375
you know,
the life of the party.

456
00:22:53,417 --> 00:22:58,041
Until she was
the death of it.

457
00:22:58,083 --> 00:23:00,750
Can you explain that?
Uh, she was wild.

458
00:23:00,792 --> 00:23:04,041
She was wild.
She was funny, she was loud.

459
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:07,041
Always dancing on tables.

460
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:11,583
Until she would fall off
the tables. She, um...

461
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:14,375
She almost
burned the house down.

462
00:23:14,417 --> 00:23:17,041
Intentionally?
No, she was...

463
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:20,709
She said she was making popcorn.
The oil caught fire.

464
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:23,917
I remember her saying
she thought it looked cool,

465
00:23:23,959 --> 00:23:27,041
so instead of trying
to put the fire out,

466
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:30,750
she started fanning the flames
to make it bigger.

467
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,792
Luckily, I knew where
the fire extinguisher was.

468
00:23:34,834 --> 00:23:37,875
Was she drunk or high?
I never could tell.

469
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,917
You know, she was just...

470
00:23:39,959 --> 00:23:41,041
She was just wild.

471
00:23:43,542 --> 00:23:45,125
And then...

472
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,750
And then what?

473
00:23:49,792 --> 00:23:51,542
And then she would turn.

474
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:55,000
All of a sudden, she would think
the world was against her.

475
00:23:56,291 --> 00:23:58,125
I put out her fire,
like, literally.

476
00:23:58,166 --> 00:24:01,750
I stopped her from burning down
the house and...

477
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:04,041
And?
And she cried

478
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:07,208
for like three days straight.

479
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,917
She, uh...
She threatened suicide.

480
00:24:09,959 --> 00:24:13,291
She accused me
of hating her and...

481
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,792
Of wanting her dead.

482
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:22,291
She was not easy
to live with.

483
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,458
She's my sister
and I love her,

484
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:33,208
but when you say
that she's in there somewhere...

485
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:37,000
I don't know how I feel
about that.

486
00:24:40,917 --> 00:24:42,375
Look, it's been
a long day.

487
00:24:42,417 --> 00:24:44,792
Do you mind
if I just take her home,

488
00:24:44,834 --> 00:24:46,000
and we can continue
tomorrow?

489
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:48,041
Sure.
All right. Thanks.

490
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:49,625
I appreciate this.
Uh-huh.

491
00:24:58,625 --> 00:25:02,041
Coop, I found him.

492
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:25,291
You know, when I was
a little older than you are,

493
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:27,083
my cousins
used to go

494
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:30,041
hang out at the river
with their friends.

495
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:31,959
And I was
just desperate to go.

496
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,667
But every time I asked
my daddy, he said no.

497
00:25:35,709 --> 00:25:37,041
I wasn't old enough.

498
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:40,000
So one weekend
I snuck out.

499
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:44,667
Hitched a ride and went to see
what all the fuss was about.

500
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:48,041
And you know what?
My daddy was right.

501
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:49,375
It was just
a whole lot of...

502
00:25:50,709 --> 00:25:53,041
Well, big kid stuff.

503
00:25:53,083 --> 00:25:56,125
That I wasn't ready for.

504
00:25:56,166 --> 00:25:58,875
So, what I'm trying
to tell you is,

505
00:25:58,917 --> 00:26:01,917
sometimes, when
you really wanna do something--

506
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:03,750
is my mom dead?

507
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:09,041
Because no one's
letting me see her.

508
00:26:09,083 --> 00:26:11,667
When my Nana
went into the hospital,

509
00:26:13,083 --> 00:26:15,000
she never came out.

510
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:18,333
Oh, honey.

511
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,500
Hey.

512
00:26:37,542 --> 00:26:39,250
Oh, hey.

513
00:26:40,667 --> 00:26:44,041
What's up?
Nothing. I, uh...

514
00:26:44,083 --> 00:26:46,625
Well, I saved a baby today.

515
00:26:46,667 --> 00:26:49,333
Oh. Well, that's good,
you know.

516
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:52,041
I was at home, I couldn't sleep
and I saw your light on.

517
00:26:52,083 --> 00:26:56,041
I wanted to, you know,
make sure you were okay.

518
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,375
Where's Corinne?
She's asleep.

519
00:27:09,417 --> 00:27:10,792
Yeah?

520
00:27:20,083 --> 00:27:22,083
I'm sorry.
How did Charlotte lose Mason?

521
00:27:22,125 --> 00:27:23,875
Mason was very upset,

522
00:27:23,917 --> 00:27:26,125
and he just slipped out the door
when she wasn't looking.

523
00:27:26,166 --> 00:27:29,041
I need to see him.
Okay, Charlotte's bringing him.

524
00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:32,083
Now.
Mom!

525
00:27:34,625 --> 00:27:35,875
I thought you were dead.

526
00:27:35,917 --> 00:27:39,041
I'm not. Of course I'm not.

527
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:41,333
Are you gonna be okay?

528
00:27:41,375 --> 00:27:45,625
Yes, baby.
Mommy's gonna be just fine.

529
00:28:00,834 --> 00:28:04,542
Unh. Hey.

530
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:06,917
Hey.

531
00:28:06,959 --> 00:28:09,750
You don't have to leave,
you know.

532
00:28:09,792 --> 00:28:14,291
Nothing's changed, Sam.
I mean...

533
00:28:14,333 --> 00:28:18,250
Nothing's changed.
So... unh.

534
00:28:18,291 --> 00:28:20,667
I do have to go.

535
00:28:24,166 --> 00:28:26,041
Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to--

536
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:27,750
no, no, don't be sorry.

537
00:28:27,792 --> 00:28:32,041
I'm not sorry.
I just have to go.

538
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:34,250
I'm gonna check on you too.
I'm worried about you.

539
00:28:34,291 --> 00:28:37,875
I wish I could say
you didn't have to be,

540
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:42,583
but honestly,
I'm worried about me too.

541
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:10,041
You don't like me
very much.

542
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:13,041
Uh, well,
I don't really know you.

543
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:16,166
Only thing I know about you
is the first thing you did

544
00:29:16,208 --> 00:29:20,792
after your baby was born
was leave to get high, so...

545
00:29:20,834 --> 00:29:25,083
I was jonesing,
he was screaming. I...

546
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:27,875
I had to get away and drugs
are how I've always done that.

547
00:29:27,917 --> 00:29:31,041
And now
it's gonna be different?

548
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:34,625
How do I answer that?

549
00:29:34,667 --> 00:29:36,709
I wanna say yes.

550
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:41,417
That I would die before I hurt
Eli the way I hurt Denise.

551
00:29:41,458 --> 00:29:44,667
But you're gonna tell me
I'm an addict and addicts slip.

552
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:48,041
What do I say to that?
It's true.

553
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:50,250
But this time,

554
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:52,041
I'm gonna do everything I can
for that boy.

555
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:55,709
Do you have any idea how lucky
you are to have that choice?

556
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,667
Eli could have died
from the drugs you were doing

557
00:29:57,709 --> 00:29:59,041
when you were pregnant.

558
00:29:59,083 --> 00:30:01,041
His condition could have
killed him after he was born.

559
00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:03,041
Dcfs could have taken him
when you were gone.

560
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:05,375
You could have had
a bad reaction detoxing.

561
00:30:05,417 --> 00:30:09,542
Frankly, it is a miracle
you're both even here right now.

562
00:30:09,583 --> 00:30:10,792
And most parents...

563
00:30:12,417 --> 00:30:14,917
Believe me,
they don't get miracles.

564
00:30:14,959 --> 00:30:16,792
I know I screwed up.

565
00:30:16,834 --> 00:30:18,458
But I am making a choice.

566
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,291
And this time
I am choosing Eli.

567
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:21,625
Good. I hope so.

568
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:24,542
Being a parent,
a good parent,

569
00:30:24,583 --> 00:30:27,333
that is an all day,
every day job.

570
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:28,875
Every single day.

571
00:30:28,917 --> 00:30:32,041
I am not kidding myself.
I know it's going to be a fight.

572
00:30:32,083 --> 00:30:34,667
Every day,
like you said. And i'm...

573
00:30:36,083 --> 00:30:38,417
I'm gonna fight.
And what about Denise?

574
00:30:38,458 --> 00:30:41,583
Maybe-- I don't know.

575
00:30:41,625 --> 00:30:43,083
Maybe it's too late for us.
I don't know.

576
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:46,041
I hope that it's not,
but I learned on Denise.

577
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:48,917
And this time I'm gonna
do it right with Eli.

578
00:30:48,959 --> 00:30:50,291
I know
that I left once.

579
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:52,208
And I'm sure
there is a better way

580
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:55,083
to do what I had to do, but...

581
00:30:55,125 --> 00:30:57,625
At least this time, even though
I did the wrong thing,

582
00:30:57,667 --> 00:30:59,125
it was for the right reasons.

583
00:30:59,166 --> 00:31:01,000
It really was.

584
00:31:04,083 --> 00:31:08,125
I believe in second chances,
but I don't trust this woman.

585
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:10,000
She's been sober
for eight days.

586
00:31:10,041 --> 00:31:12,458
That's not enough time,
not by a long shot, right?

587
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,125
Maybe Melissa doesn't have
to raise Eli all by herself.

588
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:17,041
You know,
maybe she can ask for help.

589
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,166
Denise cares, right?

590
00:31:18,208 --> 00:31:20,041
She does, but, I mean,

591
00:31:20,083 --> 00:31:22,166
you should see
these two people together.

592
00:31:22,208 --> 00:31:24,333
Well, you should see
me and Pete together.

593
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:26,000
But kids are
an exception.

594
00:31:26,041 --> 00:31:28,542
If there's one thing that Pete
and I agree on, it's Lucas.

595
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:30,041
That's it? Just Lucas?

596
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:33,959
If you're asking me
if it's over, I don't know.

597
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,041
Back when we were together,
you know, Pete was an ass.

598
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:41,583
And now
that we're apart, he's...

599
00:31:41,625 --> 00:31:43,583
He's actually more of an ass.
You know, he--

600
00:31:43,625 --> 00:31:44,792
ha-ha-ha.

601
00:31:44,834 --> 00:31:47,041
No, he refuses
to let me be happy

602
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:49,417
with anybody else.
Okay, but seeing you with Scott.

603
00:31:49,458 --> 00:31:51,125
That has gotta be
weird for him.

604
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:54,834
What are you doing?
What do you mean?

605
00:31:54,875 --> 00:31:56,041
You're defending him.

606
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:57,625
No, I get
where he's coming from.

607
00:31:57,667 --> 00:31:59,166
From a place
where he wants me miserable.

608
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:01,667
No, he's hurt.
He's the one who wanted

609
00:32:01,709 --> 00:32:04,166
to see other people.
I hated the idea. I cried.

610
00:32:04,208 --> 00:32:07,041
I thought about it logically
and I thought, "Pete's right.

611
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:08,875
"He wants to be happy.
I wanna be happy.

612
00:32:08,917 --> 00:32:10,834
And neither of us
should interfere with that."

613
00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:12,959
Aren't you interfering
by being in a relationship

614
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,041
with somebody he works with?
The thing with Scott,

615
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:17,834
it's not a relationship.
It's sex.

616
00:32:17,875 --> 00:32:20,083
It's exactly the same thing
that he's doing.

617
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:23,667
The only difference is that
it's someone he sort of knows.

618
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:25,041
And sometimes sees.

619
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:29,917
But, Coop, it's...
It's not going anywhere.

620
00:32:29,959 --> 00:32:32,583
Well, maybe you should
tell Pete that.

621
00:32:50,208 --> 00:32:52,291
How long are you gonna
keep Mason in the dark?

622
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:57,500
Well, you saw how he reacted
when he thought I...

623
00:33:03,583 --> 00:33:04,917
I can't tell him.

624
00:33:07,083 --> 00:33:10,041
With all due respect,

625
00:33:10,083 --> 00:33:13,041
last night, Mason dumped dinner
on the floor,

626
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:16,041
ran out the door
and scared the hell out of me.

627
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:18,625
Because he is worried
about you.

628
00:33:18,667 --> 00:33:22,041
Now, he's smart
and he needs some answers,

629
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,417
and this is
only gonna get worse.

630
00:33:23,458 --> 00:33:26,000
If you don't tell him--

631
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:30,041
he's never gonna
forgive you.

632
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:32,917
And he'll hate
me and Cooper,

633
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:35,166
the only people
he'll have left.

634
00:33:36,417 --> 00:33:38,583
Erica, I know
why you're lying to him.

635
00:33:40,417 --> 00:33:42,750
But you're lying to him.

636
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:51,750
It's too much.

637
00:33:51,792 --> 00:33:54,125
I can't tell him.

638
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:56,583
Not yet.

639
00:33:59,834 --> 00:34:02,083
I just can't.

640
00:34:08,375 --> 00:34:12,750
I told you Eli was a fighter.
So is his mother.

641
00:34:12,792 --> 00:34:14,041
What is it
with you and Melissa?

642
00:34:14,083 --> 00:34:15,250
From the very get-go,

643
00:34:15,291 --> 00:34:18,125
you've just been on her side.
Violet abandoned Lucas.

644
00:34:18,166 --> 00:34:19,792
Is that really
what's bothering you?

645
00:34:19,834 --> 00:34:21,041
It was a big deal.

646
00:34:21,083 --> 00:34:23,166
Nothing to do with
who Violet's sleeping with.

647
00:34:23,208 --> 00:34:26,458
Look, when she walked out,
it was just me and Lucas.

648
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,625
And he couldn't talk yet,
but his eyes said it all.

649
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:32,000
"Where's mommy?
You're not my mommy."

650
00:34:32,041 --> 00:34:33,917
When Violet came back,
I was so angry at her,

651
00:34:33,959 --> 00:34:35,208
but she did come back.

652
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,875
And I gave her
another chance.

653
00:34:36,917 --> 00:34:40,041
And whatever I think about her,
she's an incredible mother.

654
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:42,250
Lucas would be
much worse off without her.

655
00:34:42,291 --> 00:34:43,959
Dr. Freedman.

656
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:46,834
I had to call.

657
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:49,041
I've spoken
with Melissa and Denise.

658
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:51,417
I'm aware of the situation.
There is no situation.

659
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:53,208
Unless Melissa
starts using again.

660
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:55,041
There's no way to know.

661
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:58,041
But Melissa did make a choice
to get clean for her child.

662
00:34:58,083 --> 00:35:01,166
Dr. Freedman, we've been
through this a lot of times.

663
00:35:01,208 --> 00:35:03,750
We like to keep a child
with its mother if possible.

664
00:35:03,792 --> 00:35:06,959
But if your instincts say
it's to Eli's detriment,

665
00:35:07,041 --> 00:35:08,458
then we can explore
other options.

666
00:35:10,792 --> 00:35:15,500
Mm-hm. Yeah.

667
00:35:15,542 --> 00:35:17,041
I need to talk to you.

668
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:18,500
Just a minute.

669
00:35:18,542 --> 00:35:20,542
No, I need to talk to you now.

670
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:22,375
Shainie, can I call back?

671
00:35:23,667 --> 00:35:26,041
Yeah. Thanks.
What's so important?

672
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:27,291
I have a lead

673
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,041
on a way to treat
Erica's gliosarcoma.

674
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:30,208
I have a lead.

675
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:31,917
If it involves
getting on a plane,

676
00:35:31,959 --> 00:35:33,875
Erica already said
she didn't wanna do that.

677
00:35:33,917 --> 00:35:36,333
This one involves
getting on a plane to Seattle.

678
00:35:36,375 --> 00:35:38,750
I think my brother Derek
can help us.

679
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:50,083
People can do awful things,
but they can also change.

680
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:53,291
You don't know my mother.
No, I don't.

681
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:55,125
But I do know
that being a parent is hard.

682
00:35:55,166 --> 00:35:57,375
And it is easy to make mistakes.

683
00:35:57,417 --> 00:36:01,250
Even when you're trying
to do the right thing.

684
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:03,125
Is that why
you're giving her Eli?

685
00:36:03,166 --> 00:36:05,375
Because you think
it's been hard for her?

686
00:36:05,417 --> 00:36:07,000
I think it's been hard
for your mom.

687
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:08,583
I think
it's been hard for you.

688
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:12,166
And it's sad.

689
00:36:13,667 --> 00:36:17,959
But hopefully it can be
a reminder to both of you,

690
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,041
that with Eli,
it has to be different.

691
00:36:21,083 --> 00:36:23,750
He's gonna need a lot of care
while he's recovering.

692
00:36:23,792 --> 00:36:29,000
Your mom's gonna need help
being a mom.

693
00:36:30,583 --> 00:36:32,417
I--

694
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:34,250
I know it must not
seem fair to you,

695
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:37,125
but you are a family.

696
00:36:37,166 --> 00:36:40,583
And you have to look out
for one another.

697
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:50,375
Hey.

698
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:52,542
Lucas wanted to know
if his truck could fly,

699
00:36:52,583 --> 00:36:55,041
and it can't,
so I got him a new one.

700
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:58,000
I thought he could leave it
at your house. No stairs.

701
00:37:04,417 --> 00:37:06,041
You know,
it's just sex.

702
00:37:06,083 --> 00:37:09,375
With Scott. It's just sex.
It's a distraction.

703
00:37:10,709 --> 00:37:13,625
I'm sorry.
I'm just not evolved enough

704
00:37:13,667 --> 00:37:15,041
to wanna hear
about your sex life.

705
00:37:15,083 --> 00:37:16,417
No. I wasn't gonna
give you details,

706
00:37:16,458 --> 00:37:18,291
I just wanted you to know
it wasn't serious.

707
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:21,041
Okay. I just...
I still don't like it.

708
00:37:21,083 --> 00:37:23,041
You walked away,
so you shouldn't care.

709
00:37:23,083 --> 00:37:25,625
I know I shouldn't care,
but I do.

710
00:37:25,667 --> 00:37:27,667
You do?

711
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:31,291
Yeah.

712
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:34,041
Well, maybe that means--

713
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:37,291
you don't have to interpret
my feelings, Violet. I just...

714
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:41,834
I care.

715
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,041
Is he really
gonna be okay?

716
00:37:50,083 --> 00:37:52,041
I resected the damaged part
of Eli's lung.

717
00:37:52,083 --> 00:37:54,542
In time, healthy tissue
will grow in its place.

718
00:37:55,792 --> 00:37:57,625
Thank you.

719
00:37:57,667 --> 00:37:59,417
You can do this,
Melissa.

720
00:37:59,458 --> 00:38:01,542
I know.
It's all about Eli now.

721
00:38:05,166 --> 00:38:07,083
Maybe not all.

722
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:16,166
I thought that you--
bailed?

723
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,083
Yeah.

724
00:38:21,291 --> 00:38:23,750
I'm...

725
00:38:23,792 --> 00:38:26,917
I'm so--
I know, mom. I know.

726
00:38:29,709 --> 00:38:31,208
I am sorry.

727
00:38:33,125 --> 00:38:37,542
Then do better
with Eli, okay?

728
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:40,333
Do better.

729
00:38:50,959 --> 00:38:53,959
Hey. How's it going
with your sister?

730
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,166
Pretty much the same.

731
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:58,041
It'll take a while
for the meds to wear off.

732
00:38:58,083 --> 00:38:59,750
- You took her off everything?
- No.

733
00:38:59,792 --> 00:39:01,625
No, I kept her
on a mild sedative,

734
00:39:01,667 --> 00:39:05,959
because we didn't know
what to expect when...

735
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,542
We just don't know
anything yet.

736
00:39:10,834 --> 00:39:14,041
Keep me updated, okay?
Thanks, Sheldon.

737
00:39:14,083 --> 00:39:15,750
You keep her at your house?

738
00:39:15,792 --> 00:39:18,333
No, no.
She's in my office.

739
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:22,542
Staring at the walls.
That's hard.

740
00:39:23,792 --> 00:39:26,000
Yeah, it's...
Hard.

741
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:33,417
Hey.
Hey.

742
00:39:43,917 --> 00:39:45,250
Okay.

743
00:39:45,291 --> 00:39:48,333
Should've seen that coming.
Didn't. Should've.

744
00:39:48,375 --> 00:39:50,625
Jake.
When you're, uh...

745
00:39:50,667 --> 00:39:53,834
When you're ready to meet
more surrogates, let me know.

746
00:39:57,792 --> 00:40:00,583
I know it's complicated
and it's scary,

747
00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:02,792
and we can't promise you
that this will work.

748
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:05,625
The one thing I can promise
is this gives you a little hope.

749
00:40:05,667 --> 00:40:07,041
Isn't that what we said
about chemo?

750
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:10,041
What we said about chemo
was it would buy you some time.

751
00:40:10,083 --> 00:40:13,291
You told us you didn't want
whatever time you had left

752
00:40:13,333 --> 00:40:15,834
ruined by what chemo does
to your body.

753
00:40:15,875 --> 00:40:17,291
But this surgery,

754
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:19,709
it has the potential to be
more than just a treatment.

755
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,458
We're not talking
about buying time,

756
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,875
we're talking
about curing you.

757
00:40:23,917 --> 00:40:26,417
I know you don't wanna
tell Mason

758
00:40:26,458 --> 00:40:28,208
that at some point
this tumor will kill you.

759
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:33,000
If you're open to this,
you may not have to.

760
00:40:51,667 --> 00:40:53,250
Hey.

761
00:40:55,917 --> 00:40:57,083
You hungry?

762
00:41:03,291 --> 00:41:04,875
It reminds me.

763
00:41:04,917 --> 00:41:10,500
Remember that house
we used to go to in the summers?

764
00:41:10,542 --> 00:41:13,250
It was in north Carolina.

765
00:41:13,291 --> 00:41:15,375
Right on the beach.

766
00:41:21,417 --> 00:41:23,750
Uh, yeah,
I remember.

767
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:31,000
Your house reminds me of that.

768
00:42:02,709 --> 00:42:06,083
I pushed myself
to the limit that semester.

769
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:09,041
Maybe even past the limit.

770
00:42:09,083 --> 00:42:13,083
I was stressed,
didn't sleep,

771
00:42:13,125 --> 00:42:16,041
got an incomplete in tennis,
had to take it over.

772
00:42:16,083 --> 00:42:18,208
And in retrospect?

773
00:42:20,208 --> 00:42:22,458
I loved every minute of it.
