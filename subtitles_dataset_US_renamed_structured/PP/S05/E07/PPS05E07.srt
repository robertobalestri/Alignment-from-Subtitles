What?

98
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:27,041
We had a disagreement about
punctuality and her lack of it,

99
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,792
and she elected to resign
from the hospital.

100
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,041

112
00:04:00,834 --> 00:04:03,917

rate of 26.

113
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:05,000
What happened?

114
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,625
Shannon iverson.
She's one of my patients.

115
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:08,625
Motor vehicle accident.
Severe blunt head trauma.

116
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:10,417
Absent corneal reflex.

117
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,041
She's carrying
a 16-week-old fetus.

118
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,041
Mom have any brain activity?

119
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,709
None. And she's not breathing
without the ventilator.

120
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,041
Okay, fetal heart rate
looks strong.

121
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,834
Looks like she's still carrying
a healthy baby boy.

122
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,250
Hey. Thanks for calling.
Is this Shannon?

123
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:25,917
You know her?

124
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,458
She's an organ donor, Jake.

125
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,709
Yeah,
my patient needs her heart.

126
00:04:38,542 --> 00:04:41,959
I worked with Shannon
and her husband for four years,

127
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,333
multiple rounds of I.V.F.
This baby is their miracle.

128
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:47,041
A 16-week-old miracle
who's not yet viable.

129
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,583
My patient has cardiomyopathy--

130
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,583
status 1A, desperately needs
a new heart.

131
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,583
So you do a risky transplant
on your patient.

132
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,041
If she's lucky,
she gets what, ten years?

133
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,959
This baby
can have a full life.

134
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,709
If it even survives.
The mother's brain-dead.

135
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,959
Can the baby make it?

136
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,500
It's a long shot.

137
00:05:00,542 --> 00:05:02,000
But it is possible?

138
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,291
It's possible, yes,
but it doesn't justify

139
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,041
turning the mother
into a human Incubator.

140
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:08,041
So what, you'd rather just
pull the plug on this woman?

141
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:09,750
Would I rather? No.

142
00:05:09,792 --> 00:05:11,875
But the reality is, she probably
won't survive long enough

143
00:05:11,917 --> 00:05:14,875
to bring the baby to viability,
and even if she does,

144
00:05:14,917 --> 00:05:16,542
the placental blood flow
and fetal oxygenation

145
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,041
might be compromised,

146
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,000
both of which are critically
important to the fetus.

147
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,333
She signed the donor card

148
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,834
so she could save
a lot of people with her organs.

149
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:26,417
And I know this woman wants
this baby more than anything.

150
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:27,917
Well, she's not gonna
be around to raise it.

151
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,709
But her husband can.

152
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,041
Well, where is he?

153
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,333
They're taking
some time apart.

154
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,333
Actually,
it's been about a year.

155
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,000
The stress
of the fertility treatments

156
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,625
was really hard on them,

157
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:41,709
so Doug took off, and Shannon's
been trying on her own.

158
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,000
Okay. So the husband's
not in the picture,

159
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,000
and she's--she's brain-dead.

160
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:46,208
Why are you fighting this?

161
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,959
The point is moot.

162
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,917
Without a family member to make
an affirmative decision,

163
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:52,041
the hospital has to rely on
the intent of the donor card.

164
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,667
In 24 hours,
we'll do a repeat e.E.G.,

165
00:05:54,709 --> 00:05:56,959
certify brain death,
and Shannon becomes a donor.

166
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,041
What if I find Doug?

167
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:00,000
You better do it fast.

168
00:06:09,834 --> 00:06:10,875
Hey.

169
00:06:10,917 --> 00:06:12,208
Hey.
Is everything all right?

170
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,000
Well, I drove Mason
to school this morning,

171
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,000
only we get there,
and no school.

172
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,041
There was no school?

173
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:20,041
Well, there's a school.
Open it is not.

174
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,750
She talks like Yoda
when she's stressed.

175
00:06:21,792 --> 00:06:23,333
Someone,
who shall rename nameless,

176
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,583
forgot to mention
it's teacher planning day.

177
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,041
So hang out
with Mason today I must.

178
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,417
I will pick him up
around 6:30.

179
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,041
At my place.

180
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,917
But it'll just be you
hanging out with him, right?

181
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:35,041
No Charlotte?

182
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:36,041
Right. Right.

183
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,583
Okay.

184
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:41,041
You ever built a fort
made out of tongue depressors?

185
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,000
No.

186
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,250
Mm-hmm.

187
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,667
I brought you the "o."

188
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,041
Thanks. I'm still digesting
the "v" and the "I."

189
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,000
Uh...

190
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,500
How's it feel, being back?

191
00:06:58,542 --> 00:07:01,625
Oh, it's a relief.
I really missed being here.

192
00:07:01,667 --> 00:07:04,041
And I had enough
of being at home.

193
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,542
Do you want
to talk about that?

194
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:08,125
No. I-I just want
to get back to work.

195
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,291
Okay.

196
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,041
So, uh,
one of the requirements

197
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,041
for, uh,
reinstating my license

198
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:16,834
is to have a period
of practice supervision.

199
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,750
Well, i'd--I'd be honored.

200
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:20,041
I mean,
if--if you're asking me.

201
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,041
I am.

202
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:24,041
You know, I've supervised
a few therapists before.

203
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,750
Just so you understand,
it's more of a formality.

204
00:07:25,792 --> 00:07:28,041
Just dotting the i's,
crossing the t's.

205
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,041
Actually, it's, uh,
a little bit more than that.

206
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:33,041
You know, it can be a valuable
experience for therapists

207
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,542
who want to
shake the rust off,

208
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:38,542
provided both parties
take it seriously, of course.

209
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,041
Of course.

210
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,000
It's gonna be fun.

211
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,542
Should we have the, uh, carnitas
or the al pastor?

212
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:51,083
Both. Then you can
have me again.

213
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,250
Hey, Amelia.

214
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,500
Hi. Uh...

215
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:57,709
What are you doing here?

216
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,083
We're getting tacos.

217
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,291
Uh, this is Mason. Mason,
this is Dr. Shepherd.

218
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,750
Nice to meet you.

219
00:08:03,792 --> 00:08:05,500
Hey.

220
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:07,542
Mason's my son.

221
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,041
How you doing, man?

222
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,625
We just washed our hands.

223
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:13,041
Whatever.

224
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,834
You doing okay?

225
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:20,041
Why wouldn't I be?

226
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,041
No, I just heard
that you quit your job

227
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,417
and you're hanging out
with some guy.

228
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,125
His name is Ryan
and he's great.

229
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,834
And did Ryan
quit his job, too?

230
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,291
Okay, don't start
getting all judgmental.

231
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,333
You knocked up some random chick
in a bar parking lot.

232
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:33,500
Hey.

233
00:08:33,542 --> 00:08:37,041
Really, Amelia?

234
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:40,291
Sorry.

235
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:41,959
Enjoy your tacos.

236
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,041
Yeah.

237
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,041
She doesn't really
seem like a doctor.

238
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,750
Yeah, I know.

239
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,417
Sam, you, uh, you paged me?

240
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,041
Yeah, just wanted you
to meet the schaeffers.

241
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:10,041
Dr. Reilly, this is Mike.
He's a med student.

242
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:13,041
Studies way more
than I ever did.

243
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,250
And here we have j.J.

244
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:15,917
He's gonna be a nurse.

245
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:17,166
Shut up.

246
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,000
And this...

247
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:21,083
I'm Lee Ann.

248
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,625
It's nice to meet you,
Dr. Reilly.

249
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:24,875
Same here.

250
00:09:24,917 --> 00:09:26,041
Are you
on the transplant team, too?

251
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,875
Do--do you think
we'll get the heart today?

252
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:29,375
I can't wait
to go back

253
00:09:29,417 --> 00:09:32,875
to taking care of my kids again.

254
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:34,417
Instead of the other way around.

255
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,709
Listen, great meeting you guys.
Um, if you'll excuse me,

256
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,041
I have to have a word
with Dr. Bennett

257
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,166
outside for a minute.

258
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,583
What the hell was that?

259
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,709
Well, I just thought it was
important for you to meet them.

260
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,041
Or maybe you just thought

261
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,542
you could guilt me
into changing my mind.

262
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,125
Jake, if Lee Ann
doesn't get that heart

263
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:56,041
in the next day or two, it's not
just her life that's destroyed.

264
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,625
Those kids--they need her.

265
00:09:57,667 --> 00:10:00,125
You know, I'm not
a first-year intern, Sam.

266
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,041
I'm your colleague
and your friend.

267
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,542
And that?

268
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:06,000
That was not cool.

269
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:14,041
Gentlemen, meet my son Mason.

270
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,667
Pleased to meet you.

271
00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:18,125
Clearly, he has his mother's
manners. Hey, I'm Pete.

272
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,500
I'm Sheldon.

273
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,250
Why are you all smiling at me?

274
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,583
Well, you're such a...

275
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:28,750
Mini Cooper.

276
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:30,291
Yeah, I know.

277
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,250
New hire?

278
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,709
Hi. I'm Mason.
Cooper's my dad.

279
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,875
Hello. I'm Addison.

280
00:10:35,917 --> 00:10:38,250
We went for tacos.
You want one?

281
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:41,250
Uh, yes,
that would be lovely.

282
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:43,500
Thank you.

283
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:46,041
Oh, yeah, and we bumped into

284
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,041
Amelia and... Ryan.

285
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,125
What's he like?

286
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,250
Handsome but shiftless.

287
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:52,667
Mason.

288
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:54,875
I don't even know what it means.
You said it in the car.

289
00:10:54,917 --> 00:10:56,291
Well, I shouldn't have.

290
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,208
So Amelia's skipping work,
she's hanging out with this guy.

291
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,959
You think she's, um...

292
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,208
Eating tacos again?

293
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,500
Eating tacos?

294
00:11:04,542 --> 00:11:06,959
You know, she has a history.

295
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,333
With tacos--
she doesn't digest them well.

296
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:12,041
Oh, right, right.
Yeah, uh, well,

297
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:13,792
um, I don't know,

298
00:11:13,834 --> 00:11:16,041
but I suspect that she is...

299
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,041
Drinking soda again.

300
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,500
Soda or margaritas?

301
00:11:20,542 --> 00:11:22,333
Because I think
we can say "margaritas."

302
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,291
Okay, well, fine.
She's drinking margaritas.

303
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,041
Are you sure?
Have you seen it?

304
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:29,083
Well, she looked
pretty hungover this morning.

305
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,041
But you didn't see
any taco usage?

306
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,625
Margaritas are bad enough,

307
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:34,375
but if it's tacos,
she could be in big trouble.

308
00:11:34,417 --> 00:11:36,375
I think tacos are good.

309
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:40,500
But, mm, that doctor kinda
looked like a druggie to me.

310
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,959
So your boyfriend
just blindsided me.

311
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,125
What are you talking about?

312
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,875
Paged me
to his patient's room

313
00:11:54,917 --> 00:11:56,208
so I could meet the woman
who needs a heart,

314
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,125
listen to her two boys
thank me for helping her.

315
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,834
Okay,
that doesn't sound like Sam.

316
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,834
Yeah, it surprised me, too.

317
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:04,166
Well, maybe you misunderstood
his intentions?

318
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,375
Oh, I doubt that.
Look, he wants Shannon's heart.

319
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:09,041
He's gonna do anything he can
to get it. Addison.

320
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,583
I'm sorry. I don't have time
to talk about this right now.

321
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:14,291
I've got something to do.

322
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,709
Two years
I worked on that case.

323
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,041
Two years of nights
and weekends

324
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,041
and "sorry, I can't make it
to dinner" excuses

325
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,458
to my family...

326
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,500
Then that bastard
screws me out of the trial

327
00:12:24,542 --> 00:12:26,250
because suddenly
it seemed winnable.

328
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:29,041
How'd that make you feel?

329
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,041
Pissed.

330
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,291
I was frustrated.

331
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,166
Well, it must have been
very painful

332
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,083
to have something you worked
so hard on get taken away.

333
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:37,667
And he took credit
for all of my work.

334
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:39,875
You know, I had that
happen to me once.

335
00:12:39,917 --> 00:12:41,959
It was, uh, a paper
that I'd written,

336
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,291
and my supervisor...

337
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,417
W-When I find myself
in a situation

338
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:51,417
where my professional space is
not being respected,

339
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:54,500
it's important for me
to re--

340
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,917
deep-breathing exercises
are an effective way

341
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,417
of handling unexpected stress.

342
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,041
Let's try one now, shall we?

343
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,417
Deep breath.

344
00:13:09,542 --> 00:13:10,291
Ready?

345
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,333
Bring it.

346
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,000
Oh, my god.

347
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,000
Amelia.

348
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:26,041
Hey, you're back.
You wanna join?

349
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,250
No.

350
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:29,250
Your loss.

351
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:33,291
We need to talk. Now.

352
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:36,250
I'll just...
Go get some more limes.

353
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:41,125
You don't want to talk.
You want to lecture,

354
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,166
and honestly,
I'm not in the mood.

355
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:45,709
It's a beautiful day,
most of which I have spent

356
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,959
having mind-blowing sex
with a guy who looks like

357
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,291
he walked off
a Calvin klein billboard.

358
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,792
I think you're in trouble,
Amelia.

359
00:13:52,834 --> 00:13:56,000
Well, if this is trouble,
you should try it.

360
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,834
I'm worried about you
and I love you,

361
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:02,709
and we are family, and family
looks out for each other.

362
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,000
We stopped being family
when you started sleeping

363
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:08,000
with my brother's best friend
while you were still married.

364
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:12,500
I'm not the enemy.
I'm just trying to help you.

365
00:14:12,542 --> 00:14:16,083
Well, consider yourself
off the hook.

366
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:19,375
Ryan, we're leaving.

367
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:25,875
Okay, what's happening?

368
00:14:25,917 --> 00:14:27,375
She dropped her sats.
Couldn't ventilate her.

369
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,166
All right, delayed breath sounds
on the right side.

370
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,125
I'm gonna put in a chest tube.
No offense, Dr. Reilly,

371
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:34,875
but when was the last time
you did that?

372
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:37,125
It's been a while.
We're just delaying
the inevitable here.

373
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:39,041
I spoke to her husband.
He's flying in from London.

374
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,041
What we need to do is keep her
alive until he gets here.

375
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,041
Tube's ready.

376
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,875
Wait. Wait. Wait.
This is insane.

377
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:46,875
Sam.
What's insane is you ambushing
me with Lee Ann and her family.

378
00:14:46,917 --> 00:14:48,792
Just wanted you to see
what the other side of this

379
00:14:48,834 --> 00:14:51,208
looks like.
What about
Shannon's husband's side, hmm?

380
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,667
What about his?

381
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:54,625
Okay.

382
00:15:04,542 --> 00:15:06,417
This woman is gone, Jake.

383
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:09,250
My patient is at the top
of the u.N.O.S. List,

384
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,709
waiting for her heart,

385
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,917
and you're just worried about
her husband's feelings.

386
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,041
All it's gonna do
is cost my patient her life.

387
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:18,458
Her husband doesn't have
that right, and neither do you.

388
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:27,834
So what kind of doctor
are you?

389
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,959
I'm a neurosurgeon.

390
00:15:32,542 --> 00:15:34,041
Seriously?

391
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,500
I could cut into your brain
right now for kicks.

392
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:38,667
In this hotel room? Wow.

393
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,417
What about you?

394
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:44,875
What's your story?

395
00:15:44,917 --> 00:15:46,208
Me? Okay.

396
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,333
I'm overprivileged,
overfunded,

397
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:51,250
undermotivated.

398
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:54,417
Kind of the opposite
of a doctor.

399
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:57,333
You're saying, you're
unemployed but you got bank.

400
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,333
I'm saying,
I'm the family disappointment,

401
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,917
but yeah, you could put it
that way, too.

402
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:06,375
I was the family disappointment
once upon a time.

403
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:08,125
Actually...

404
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:11,500
I think this week,
I probably am again.

405
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:17,542
I like you, Amelia.
I don't want to drag you down.

406
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:22,000
Into your unemployed,
overprivileged misery?

407
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,458
I'm a pillhead.

408
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,125
It's kind of all I do,

409
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,041
and I know I'm probably
gonna have to

410
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,709
do something about it
someday soon,

411
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:36,083
but the truth is, I haven't
got that much left to lose.

412
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,625
You're a doctor.

413
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:40,375
You've worked really hard
for that.

414
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:43,417
And you're smart
and beautiful.

415
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,500
And I like you enough
to tell you

416
00:16:45,542 --> 00:16:49,667
that you should probably go
to work or something, you know?

417
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:53,834
Because if you lose your job,

418
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:56,542
who's gonna write us refills?

419
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,750
Four pages of notes
on one session?

420
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:05,750
Really, Sheldon?

421
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:06,750
Feedback is an essential part

422
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:08,250
of re-immersion
into your practice.

423
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:09,583
Don't you think you're taking
this a little too seriously?

424
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,000
Maybe you're not taking it
seriously enough.

425
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,458
What does that mean?

426
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,750
Personal anecdotes,
talking about your own life--

427
00:17:14,792 --> 00:17:16,417
patients can do that
with their friends,

428
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,041
but you're a therapist.

429
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:20,375
It is effective.
It establishes rapport,

430
00:17:20,417 --> 00:17:23,208
trust.
Self-disclosure should only
be used as a last resort.

431
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,458
I cannot believe you are
judging my methodology.

432
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,625
Well, that's what I get
for even thinking

433
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:30,000
of asking you to monitor me.

434
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,667
No, that's what you get
for thinking I'd be an easy "a."

435
00:17:31,709 --> 00:17:34,125
There is a process
to reinstatement, Violet.

436
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,208
I'm following it.

437
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,041
A little too aggressively.

438
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,917
Hey, you came to me. I'm not
gonna sugarcoat my opinion.

439
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:41,041
Fine. I'm not
gonna sugarcoat mine.

440
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:46,917
Because we're friends, I'm going
to leave that out of my report!

441
00:17:55,959 --> 00:17:59,583
Ugh! I cannot be this bad
at this. Are you cheating?

442
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,208
Since when do we own that?

443
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,875
Match point.
 Since, uh, today, on the way home from work.

444
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,041
I thought you had
a staff meeting at the hospital.

445
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:09,041
Canceled.

446
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:11,041
Game, set, match.

447
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,208
Charlotte, Mason.

448
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,667
Mason, Charlotte.

449
00:18:15,709 --> 00:18:17,709
I saw your picture
in Cooper's office.

450
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,041
You're his wife, right?

451
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:20,500
I am indeed.

452
00:18:20,542 --> 00:18:22,625
Prettier in person.

453
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:24,667
Well, you got your daddy's gift
for smooth talk.

454
00:18:24,709 --> 00:18:26,417
That's for sure.

455
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:29,458
You wanna play?
Cooper kinda sucks.

456
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,667
Hey!
You're on.

457
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,291
Oh, nice.

458
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:50,041
Sorry I'm late.
I got held up at work.

459
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,041
But I really appreciate
your...

460
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,041
Mom.
It's been such a cool day.

461
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,709
Get your backpack.
But, mom--

462
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,583
get your backpack
and just wait for me outside.

463
00:19:08,792 --> 00:19:11,083
I ask one thing--keep your wife
away from my child.

464
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,750
I didn't know--

465
00:19:12,792 --> 00:19:15,291
it's not his fault.
I came home early.
I wasn't talking to you.

466
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:16,750
The last time I checked,
you were in my house.

467
00:19:16,792 --> 00:19:18,125
Not anymore.

468
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,041
Okay, let's not do this, okay?
Come--

No.

00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,542
He's using
this patient monitoring

531
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:56,041
to pick apart everything I do.

532
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,041
I'm sure
that's not what he means.

533
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:01,041
He's probably just--
oh, good. Yeah. No,
that's good. Take his side.

534
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:07,542
Did you tell him to back off?

535
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:09,583
I would like
to tell him that.

536
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:12,166
I would like to tell him
a lot of things.

537
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:14,625
And all I want to do is
be there for my patients

538
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:17,041
and do good work, both of which
I thought I was doing

539
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:18,834
when I wrote my book.

540
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,750
Every day since my suspension,
I've thought about what I did

541
00:22:20,792 --> 00:22:22,625
and how it affected everybody,
and I've...

542
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:26,041
Punished myself more than
the medical board ever could.

543
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:28,041
And now it is so close
to being over,

544
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:32,792
but I still can't get
my life back.

545
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:37,000
We had a life,

546
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:38,959
you know,

547
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,208
before?

548
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,875
And I just...

549
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:49,000
I just want it back.

550
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,041
I'm Dr. King.
I'm on call for the practice.

551
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:00,750
The silent alarm went off.

552
00:23:00,792 --> 00:23:03,542
I forgot to turn it off. You
know that happens all the time.

553
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:05,750
I told them who I am,
but they won't listen.

554
00:23:05,792 --> 00:23:07,750
She didn't have any I.D.,
so we need you to confirm

555
00:23:07,792 --> 00:23:09,834
whether she actually
works here.

556
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:11,041
This is Dr. Shepherd.

557
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:13,041
Just like I said.

558
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:16,417
I'm sorry for the trouble.
I can take it from here.

559
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:18,250
Sorry
for the misunderstanding.

560
00:23:25,959 --> 00:23:28,041
What'd you steal?

561
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:30,458
Spare me the drama,
Charlotte.

562
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,000
When I left the other day,

563
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:34,083
I grabbed my purse,
forgot my wallet.

564
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:38,000
What the hell are you doing?

565
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,041
Cut the crap and give me
your prescription pad.

566
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:43,417
I know that's
what you came here for.

567
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:50,041
It's mine.
I didn't do anything wrong.

568
00:23:52,667 --> 00:23:54,500
How many prescriptions
were you gonna write tonight?

569
00:23:54,542 --> 00:23:56,041
Screw you, Charlotte.

570
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:57,041
You're not going anywhere.

571
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:58,917
What's your plan?
You gonna call the cops?

572
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:00,041
'Cause I'm pretty sure
they were just here,

573
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:02,041
and you told them you'd
handle it, so handle it.

574
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:04,542
You don't see what's happening.

575
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:06,959
You can't.

576
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,250
Please.

577
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:10,041
Let me help you.

578
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:12,041
Get out of my way.

579
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:14,041
Stay out of my life.

580
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,458
It's worse than
I thought it was--

581
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,750
maybe, uh, maybe a lot worse.

582
00:24:28,792 --> 00:24:30,333
She could wind up dead,
Charlotte.

583
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:31,792
I just--i was trying
to protect her.

584
00:24:31,834 --> 00:24:34,041
If Amelia gets arrested, they're
gonna take away her license.

585
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:35,667
You could've called someone.
You should've called me.

586
00:24:35,709 --> 00:24:37,041
Okay, she said
she made a mistake.

587
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:38,917
The question is,
what do we do now?

588
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:40,959
I don't think there's
anything we can do.

589
00:24:41,041 --> 00:24:43,542
Until Amelia wants our help--
she isn't in any position
to ask for it, Violet.

590
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:44,917
It doesn't mean
she doesn't need it.

591
00:24:44,959 --> 00:24:47,291
So Amelia has had this problem
before?

592
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:49,083
She struggled for a long time.

593
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:51,083
Oh, come on. Let's just call it
what it is. She's an addict.

594
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:54,333
Right now she is in a bad place,
and she doesn't seem to care.

595
00:24:54,375 --> 00:24:55,625
So make her care.

596
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:57,750
Suspend her until she gets
serious about this.

597
00:24:57,792 --> 00:24:59,291
I'm willing to do
whatever it takes,

598
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:01,000
but first she needs to show up.
Or we go out and find her.

599
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,500
Do you have any idea how?

600
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:03,750
I have some friends
in the police department

601
00:25:03,792 --> 00:25:05,375
I can talk to, off the record.

602
00:25:05,417 --> 00:25:06,917
The problem is Amelia
doesn't want to be found.

603
00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:09,125
We just have to hope
she comes to her senses

604
00:25:09,166 --> 00:25:10,792
before something terrible
happens.

605
00:25:10,834 --> 00:25:14,166
Yes, if you do hear from her,
Juliette, could you call me?

606
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:15,375
Yes.

607
00:25:15,417 --> 00:25:17,041
Okay. Thank you.

608
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:19,166
I can't just sit around here
while Amelia's just--

609
00:25:19,208 --> 00:25:21,750
god knows where--do...

610
00:25:21,792 --> 00:25:23,709
Do you know I called
the morgue?

611
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,458
She might be more than
just missing, Pete.

612
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,041
She--she could be dead.

613
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:29,000
O-Okay, don't get ahead
of yourself, Sheldon.

614
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:30,834
Okay, I'm just gonna--I'm just
gonna keep making calls.

615
00:25:30,875 --> 00:25:33,166
Okay, yeah, of course. Okay.

616
00:25:33,208 --> 00:25:37,041
But can I-I actually came here
to talk to you about Violet.

617
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:39,333
She was up all night
working on her charting,

618
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:40,959
which, as you know,
is not her thing.

619
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,542
Yes, well,
even though it should be.

620
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:44,208
Well, I have a hard time
believing

621
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,792
it's gonna make her
a better therapist,

622
00:25:45,834 --> 00:25:47,667
but she is doing everything
she can to please you, so--

623
00:25:47,709 --> 00:25:50,041
Amelia's dropped off
the face of the earth, Pete.

624
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:52,041
Violet staying up
a little late

625
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:54,041
to fulfill what is, after all,
her professional responsibility,

626
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:56,834
doesn't seem all that important
in comparison.

627
00:25:56,875 --> 00:25:58,041
It's important to me.

628
00:25:58,083 --> 00:25:59,667
I'm surprised
to hear you say that,

629
00:25:59,709 --> 00:26:01,166
given your attitude of late.

630
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:04,917
She's my wife, Sheldon, and we
are working through... a lot.

631
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:07,041
I'm allowed
to be critical of her,

632
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:08,625
just the way she's allowed
to be critical of me.

633
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,000
It's a fair fight.

634
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:12,000
It might be a stupid fight,
but it's a fair one.

635
00:26:12,041 --> 00:26:14,375
But you--you are just using
this position of authority

636
00:26:14,417 --> 00:26:18,250
to push her around, and Violet
deserves better than that.

637
00:26:18,291 --> 00:26:19,875
Did Violet ask you
to come here?

638
00:26:19,917 --> 00:26:22,458
No.

639
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,667
Defending Violet
is a big step for you.

640
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:27,542
It's nice work.

641
00:26:37,959 --> 00:26:39,917
Hey.

642
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:43,041
I spit on a kid once.

643
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:45,917
I'm sorry. What?

644
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:49,041
This little 6 year old spit on
Mason on the playground.

645
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:51,875
He was only 3,
and she was a real...

646
00:26:51,917 --> 00:26:54,834
She was a bully, and I spit
right back at her.

647
00:26:54,875 --> 00:26:57,834
You spit on a 6 year old?

648
00:26:57,875 --> 00:26:59,834
One of the worst things
I've ever done.

649
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:02,875
And still, I don't regret it.

650
00:27:02,917 --> 00:27:04,834
I was protecting my son.

651
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:08,041
I was standing up for my son.

652
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,875
I think maybe that's
what your wife was thinking

653
00:27:11,917 --> 00:27:16,000
when she handed me that check
and asked me to leave town.

654
00:27:16,041 --> 00:27:19,000
I think she thought she was
standing up for you.

655
00:27:19,041 --> 00:27:21,000
It's messed up.

656
00:27:21,041 --> 00:27:22,917
But, um...

657
00:27:25,709 --> 00:27:27,667
She doesn't seem like
a monster.

658
00:27:27,709 --> 00:27:29,417
She's not.

659
00:27:33,166 --> 00:27:34,875
Okay.

660
00:27:34,917 --> 00:27:37,250
Can I say hi to Mason?

661
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:38,959
Yeah.

662
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:48,208
Uh, excuse me. I got a call
about my wife, Shannon iverson.

663
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,375
I'm Dr. Bennett.

664
00:27:52,417 --> 00:27:55,625
What happened?

665
00:27:55,667 --> 00:27:57,709
I mean, I know about
the accident, but...

666
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,041
Shannon's being kept alive
on a ventilator,

667
00:28:00,083 --> 00:28:02,041
and she...

668
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:05,959
I'm afraid there's not a lot of
hope for a meaningful recovery.

669
00:28:07,875 --> 00:28:09,417
And the baby?

670
00:28:09,458 --> 00:28:12,583
She's carrying a fetus
that's about 16 weeks old,

671
00:28:12,625 --> 00:28:15,041
which means that he can't
survive outside the womb.

672
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:16,250
And to keep him alive--

673
00:28:16,291 --> 00:28:18,959
it's a boy?

674
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Yes.

675
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,166
I'm sorry.

676
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:27,333
So, uh...

677
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:29,041
What happens next?

678
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:33,041
Well, Shannon signed
an organ donor card.

679
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:36,834
And we have a woman here
who's a match.

680
00:28:36,875 --> 00:28:38,875
She desperately needs a heart.

681
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:40,000
Doug.
Now I under--

682
00:28:43,375 --> 00:28:47,041
she didn't tell me
she kept going with the I.V.F.

683
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:49,375
Well, she--she knew
how hard it was on you,

684
00:28:49,417 --> 00:28:51,208
and I think she was
going to tell you

685
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:53,041
when she was certain
it would work.

686
00:28:53,083 --> 00:28:55,417
And it did. Dr. Bennett
told me about the baby.

687
00:28:55,458 --> 00:28:59,041
I also told him that the chances
of survival are--are remote.

688
00:28:59,083 --> 00:29:00,875
I'm not sure "remote"
is accurate.

689
00:29:00,917 --> 00:29:03,875
If we can get Shannon
to 25 or 26 weeks,

690
00:29:03,917 --> 00:29:05,208
then, uh...

691
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:07,709
Dr. Bennett told me that Shannon
was gonna donate her heart.

692
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:10,041
Doug, have you had a chance
to go in and--and see Shannon?

693
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:12,041
Uh, no. Not yet.

694
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,875
There's a neonatologist
and a neurosurgeon in there

695
00:29:13,917 --> 00:29:15,583
who can answer
some of your questions,

696
00:29:15,625 --> 00:29:18,834
and then we can--
we can talk again, all right?

697
00:29:27,709 --> 00:29:29,041
Where does it end with you?

698
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:31,458
I just told him that his wife
was a match for Lee Ann.

699
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,083
You took advantage
of the situation.

700
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:35,041
You would've done
the same thing.

701
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:36,875
I'm advocating for my patient.

702
00:29:36,917 --> 00:29:38,417
The only difference between
your patient and mine is

703
00:29:38,458 --> 00:29:42,000
that your patient's already dead
and mine doesn't have to be.

704
00:29:43,542 --> 00:29:45,917
You know that
we can hear you in there.

705
00:29:45,959 --> 00:29:48,041
Good. Maybe at least you'll get
both sides of the story.

706
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:50,041
Look, I'm not trying
to manipulate the man, okay?

707
00:29:50,083 --> 00:29:51,500
Lee Ann is
running out of time.

708
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:53,583
And that baby needs more time.
You understand that, right?

709
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,000
Okay, both of you
need to understand

710
00:29:55,041 --> 00:29:57,041
that you are not going
to manipulate me either, okay?

711
00:29:57,083 --> 00:29:59,000
Because I'm not gonna choose
between you.

712
00:29:59,041 --> 00:30:01,041
It doesn't matter what the two
of you want or what I want.

713
00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:03,166
It should've been about
what Shannon wanted.

714
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:07,750
Now it's about Doug and what he
wants. That is all that matters.

715
00:30:22,083 --> 00:30:24,000
Hey, look who's awake.

716
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:25,125
Mm-hmm.

717
00:30:25,166 --> 00:30:27,083
Who are you guys?

718
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:29,166
What are you doing here?

719
00:30:29,208 --> 00:30:32,041
We're here to thank the lady
with the 'scrips.

720
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:36,625
What are you doing, inviting
total strangers in here?

721
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:38,750
They're not strangers.
They're my friends.

722
00:30:38,792 --> 00:30:40,834
Well,
I don't want to them here.

723
00:30:42,834 --> 00:30:44,208
You heard her.

724
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,750
- The party's over.
- Are you serious?

725
00:30:45,792 --> 00:30:46,917
No.

726
00:30:46,959 --> 00:30:48,375
The party just started, man.

727
00:30:48,417 --> 00:30:51,125
The party's over. Get out.

728
00:30:51,166 --> 00:30:54,125
Oh, man.

729
00:31:04,083 --> 00:31:05,542
That was manly.

730
00:31:05,583 --> 00:31:07,041
I know how to clear a room.

731
00:31:08,417 --> 00:31:11,041
I'm sorry.
Sorry. I'm just--

732
00:31:11,083 --> 00:31:12,291
you're coming down.

733
00:31:21,166 --> 00:31:24,208
What are you doing?

734
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,041
Taking the edge off.

735
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:27,583
You ever smoked it?

736
00:31:27,625 --> 00:31:29,792
No.

737
00:31:29,834 --> 00:31:31,000
Trust me.

738
00:31:34,458 --> 00:31:36,166
This will make you happier

739
00:31:36,208 --> 00:31:39,667
than you ever imagined.

740
00:32:16,709 --> 00:32:19,417
After your hopes have been...

741
00:32:19,458 --> 00:32:23,041
Crushed so many times...

742
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:27,041
Something inside you dies.

743
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:29,959
At least it did with me.

744
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I couldn't hang on to the dream
of being a parent anymore.

745
00:32:35,959 --> 00:32:38,458
But Shannon--
she never let it go.

746
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,750
Maybe we should keep her alive.

747
00:32:44,792 --> 00:32:46,875
Having this baby was her dream.

748
00:32:46,917 --> 00:32:49,458
It was.

749
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,041
But the question now is,

750
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:53,583
is it your dream?

751
00:32:58,083 --> 00:33:01,041
How does it work?

752
00:33:01,083 --> 00:33:04,458
With her and with the baby?

753
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,750
Well, if we're...

754
00:33:06,792 --> 00:33:08,709
If we're fortunate,
we can keep Shannon alive

755
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,500
until the baby gets to term,

756
00:33:10,542 --> 00:33:13,041
but that's unlikely.

757
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:15,041
What's more likely is

758
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:18,083
that the baby will be born
prematurely,

759
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:21,041
maybe traumatically so,

760
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:24,417
which puts him at serious risk
for chronic lung problems,

761
00:33:24,458 --> 00:33:27,125
developmental issues,
blindness.

762
00:33:27,166 --> 00:33:28,834
I'm telling you this

763
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:31,625
because I want you to understand
what you'd be agreeing to.

764
00:33:31,667 --> 00:33:35,041
There's a chance the baby
would be fine, but...

765
00:33:35,083 --> 00:33:39,500
There's a greater chance
that he and you...

766
00:33:39,542 --> 00:33:41,667
Would have
some serious challenges.

767
00:33:44,667 --> 00:33:47,834
And knowing all of this,

768
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:50,375
if having this baby

769
00:33:50,417 --> 00:33:53,792
is still your dream...

770
00:33:53,834 --> 00:33:56,333
Then I will stop any doctor
coming through that door

771
00:33:56,375 --> 00:33:58,959
who wants to pull the plug.

772
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,333
But if you don't want this...

773
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:06,667
Shannon would have been
an amazing mum.

774
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:11,458
She can still do
something amazing.

775
00:34:15,041 --> 00:34:16,041
Either way...

776
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:19,834
It's up to you.

777
00:34:31,709 --> 00:34:35,041
So I finished all these files,

778
00:34:35,083 --> 00:34:36,625
and y--

779
00:34:36,667 --> 00:34:38,000
you okay?

780
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:42,041
I've called everyone
and everywhere I can think of,

781
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:44,250
but there's no Amelia.

782
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:46,417
I left her so many messages

783
00:34:46,458 --> 00:34:49,041
that her mailbox is full.

784
00:34:50,417 --> 00:34:51,625
I'm sorry.

785
00:34:51,667 --> 00:34:54,041
J--I'm just--

786
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:56,041
i'm--I'm sorry.

787
00:34:57,709 --> 00:35:00,834
I may have been a bit hard
on you about your casework.

788
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:03,709
And you know how worried I am
about Amelia.

789
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,875
And...

790
00:35:05,917 --> 00:35:08,041
The truth is, I was annoyed

791
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:12,500
about how you micromanaged
my overseeing of your patients

792
00:35:12,542 --> 00:35:14,041
while you were on suspension,

793
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:17,417
and it's possible that I was
using the peer review process

794
00:35:17,458 --> 00:35:20,834
to--to be petty and vengeful,

795
00:35:20,875 --> 00:35:22,250
which, if true,

796
00:35:22,291 --> 00:35:24,542
would be wrong.

797
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:28,166
And you just came to this
realization all by yourself?

798
00:35:28,208 --> 00:35:31,166
As a fellow therapist,
I think you can appreciate

799
00:35:31,208 --> 00:35:33,166
that sometimes
our most important insights

800
00:35:33,208 --> 00:35:38,000
about ourselves can come
from someone else.

801
00:35:38,041 --> 00:35:42,041
Anyway, I sent in my report
to the medical board.

802
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:44,291
Oh, yeah?
And what did you say?

803
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:46,166
That you're
an excellent therapist

804
00:35:46,208 --> 00:35:50,000
and you deserve
to be back at work.

805
00:36:11,083 --> 00:36:13,166
Let her go.

806
00:36:21,083 --> 00:36:22,125
Okay.

807
00:36:43,875 --> 00:36:45,458
Are you okay?

808
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,792
Fine.

809
00:36:46,834 --> 00:36:49,041
Why am I not convinced?

810
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:52,583
I'm just getting
everything in order.

811
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:55,041
All right,
before you do this,

812
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:57,875
let's talk about what happened
with Shannon.

813
00:36:57,917 --> 00:36:59,166
We don't have to.

814
00:36:59,208 --> 00:37:01,083
It's not like I think
you're gonna miss.

815
00:37:01,125 --> 00:37:05,041
It's just--
it would be nice...

816
00:37:05,083 --> 00:37:07,041
I just want some good juju
in here.

817
00:37:13,083 --> 00:37:14,750
All right.

818
00:37:22,083 --> 00:37:24,875
Shannon's lungs went to
a young dad who got cancer

819
00:37:24,917 --> 00:37:26,500
even though he never smoked.

820
00:37:26,542 --> 00:37:29,041
Her liver's being partitioned
between a woman here

821
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:31,041
and a soldier in Fresno.

822
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:33,250
I get it. It...

823
00:37:33,291 --> 00:37:35,291
That's all good news,
but, uh...

824
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:37,250
It still isn't easy.

825
00:37:37,291 --> 00:37:39,709
I know.

826
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,041
It used to be easier,

827
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:42,500
for me, anyway, you know,

828
00:37:42,542 --> 00:37:44,208
it was save the mom.

829
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:47,250
You just... save the mom.

830
00:37:47,291 --> 00:37:51,208
And now
when I think about babies,

831
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:55,500
it's not clear
or easy anymore.

832
00:37:55,542 --> 00:37:59,208
And I don't know
if that's better or worse.

833
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:01,083
It's just the way it is.

834
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:03,041
What we do--it's...

835
00:38:03,083 --> 00:38:04,875
It's personal.

836
00:38:04,917 --> 00:38:06,041
It can't be anything else.

837
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:09,041
So long
as it doesn't carry over.

838
00:38:09,083 --> 00:38:11,667
Look, Sam fought.

839
00:38:11,709 --> 00:38:13,125
I fought.

840
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:15,542
At the end of the day,

841
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:17,291
Doug had
all of the information.

842
00:38:17,333 --> 00:38:21,250
It was...
It was his call to make.

843
00:38:21,291 --> 00:38:23,583
So yes...

844
00:38:23,625 --> 00:38:25,000
It won't carry over.

845
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,583
Okay.

846
00:38:29,625 --> 00:38:32,125
Look, don't worry.

847
00:38:32,166 --> 00:38:34,208
There's good juju flowing.

848
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:47,542
Hey.

849
00:38:47,583 --> 00:38:49,000
Hi.

850
00:38:50,792 --> 00:38:52,375
Sheldon apologized.

851
00:38:52,417 --> 00:38:54,333
Well, that's good.

852
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:56,959
He doesn't usually do that.

853
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,750
Or at least
it takes him longer.

854
00:39:03,083 --> 00:39:04,583
Thank you.

855
00:39:10,166 --> 00:39:12,000
Thank you.

856
00:39:14,959 --> 00:39:17,709
Hey, do you wanna...

857
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:18,834
Um...

858
00:39:18,875 --> 00:39:21,041
I think "American bake off"
is on.

859
00:39:21,083 --> 00:39:23,792
You don't like
"American bake off."

860
00:39:23,834 --> 00:39:25,208

Yeah.

873
00:40:00,917 --> 00:40:03,041
Um, he's gonna try
to get out of flossing,

874
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:04,792
so make sure he does it.
Okay.

875

That's all he'll sleep on.
