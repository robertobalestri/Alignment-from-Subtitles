I... I know
you know that about me,

00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:11,834
but most people don't.

5
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:13,208
Professionally,
I'm very confident.

6
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,792
But personally...

7
00:00:15,834 --> 00:00:17,166
I spend a lot of time
worrying about

I like to think
it makes me more prepared.

I don't ever
want to be blindsided,

13
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:29,750

We've called him,
he's on his way,

19
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,875
but we can't wait.
It's too early.

20
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:44,625
We're not due
for another two weeks.

21
00:00:44,667 --> 00:00:45,834

know that.

00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:47,000

in the car.

I'm supposed to be sorry,

00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:34,125
Okay, did you tell Pete
about that?

I can't.
Violet.

Okay.

00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:48,333
Hi, Jake.
Good morning.

55
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,875
Hey.
Listen, I have a-a mother
who just delivered.

56
00:01:50,917 --> 00:01:52,417
She's worried
about her baby.

57
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:55,041
I think it's jaundice,
but I'd appreciate a consult.

58
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:56,875
I'm slammed at the moment.
Can it wait till this afternoon?

59
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:57,959
Whatever you can spare.

60
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,500
Hey, hey. It was,
uh, really great

61
00:02:00,542 --> 00:02:01,709
meeting Angela.

62
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,959
I had no idea you had
a stepdaughter.

63
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,041
I do.

64
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,250
Yeah?

65
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:08,250
Do you--do you--you get
to see her often?

66
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:10,542
Not often enough.
I miss her.

67
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:12,041
But, you know, it's--
it's cool.

68
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:14,041
She has a way of reminding me
what's important in life.

69
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,375
She seems like a great kid.

70
00:02:15,417 --> 00:02:18,125
Yeah, she thought
you were pretty neat, too.

71
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:19,542
Hey.

72
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:20,959
We were supposed to
go running this morning.

73
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,125
I'm sorry. I just wasn't
feeling up to it.

74
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:23,750
What happened?
That's not like you.

75
00:02:23,792 --> 00:02:24,959
I know.

76
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,291
Corinne?

77
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,542
Yeah, yeah.
But it's a good thing.

78
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,542
They're gonna take
way better care of her

79
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:31,750
than I ever could've.

80
00:02:31,792 --> 00:02:33,959
Well, that's true
if you just believe it.

81
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:36,959
So you want to go out
and grab a drink tonight?

82
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,333
Uh, maybe some other time.

83
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,750
It'll be good for you.

84
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,041
It'd be good for me.

85
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:42,083
Yeah.

86
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,291
Still enjoying
the nightlife, huh?

87
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:44,500
Eh, that's done.

88
00:02:44,542 --> 00:02:45,709
What happened?

89
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,375
Nothing.
Violet?

90
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,959
She's with Scott.

91
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,166
No, she's not. According to
the nurses, that's done.

92
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,125
How do you feel today,
Elise?

93
00:02:58,458 --> 00:02:59,917
You know, the last time
I was here,

94
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:01,208
we didn't get very far,

95
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,041
and I was hoping today, you'd
like to share a little more.

96
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,041
I know it's painful,

97
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:08,750
but I truly believe that
talking about it will help.

98
00:03:08,792 --> 00:03:10,041
You can't help me.

99
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,041
I'd like to try.

100
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:14,333
You want to know
how I feel today?

101
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:18,375
The same as every day.
I feel like I'm a monster.

102
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,208
I don't think
you're a monster.

103
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,834
I murdered
my two children.

104
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,083
What would you call me?

105
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:42,041
Hey.

106
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,625
Hey. I was just about
to page you.

107
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:45,041
I've got about another
15 minutes

108
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,709
before I head to the O.R.
for a c-section.

109
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,083
Bet I could do
an ultrasound.

110
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,500
Oh, uh, yeah.

111
00:03:50,542 --> 00:03:52,083
I'm way behind today.

112
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,291
I'll be quick.

113
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,291
I'll even warm up
the gel for you.

114
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:56,792
Another time.

115
00:03:56,834 --> 00:03:58,500
Amelia...
You really should do this.

116
00:03:58,542 --> 00:04:00,417
So I can see everything
that is wrong with my baby--

117
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,041
the horns sticking out
of its head...

118
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,041
Its long corkscrew tail?

119
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,041
I know that you're freaked out,
but part of it

120
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,667
is because none of this
is real for you yet.

121
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:11,041
But as soon as you see it
on the ultrasound

122
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,291
and you hear the heartbeat,
it's all gonna change for you.

123
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,542
It's gonna be real.

124
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,041
I'll do it tomorrow,
okay?

125
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:18,041
All right. You've got
about another five minutes

126
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,417
before those baggy sweaters
aren't gonna hide that bump.

127
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:23,041
Hey. This is a good thing.

128
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:26,041
Be happy.

129
00:04:29,792 --> 00:04:30,750
Hey.

130
00:04:30,792 --> 00:04:32,083
Good morning.

131
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,417
I'm starving.

132
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:34,834
Me, too.

133
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,041
Uh, you want to go to
the breakfast burrito place

134
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,417
down at the pier or...

135
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,417
It's a school day.
I don't want to be late.

136
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:40,834
Oh, okay.

137
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:43,041
I-It's just, I don't want
my mom to get mad at me.

138
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,041
Well, she's in the hospital.
I think she'd understand.

139
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,041
Um, I mean, I was thinking,
I could play hooky from work,

140
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:49,041
and we could
go do something fun.

141
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,041
Uh, uh, that's okay.
We could go fishing.

142
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,667
Hey, if I
eat some cereal fast,

143
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,041
could you drive me
so I'm not late for math?

144
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,500
Yeah, of course.

145
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:56,959
Cool.

146
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,750
Oh, hey, mase. I need a new
picture of you for my phone.

147
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,166
Okay.

148
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:12,709
Mm.

149
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,166
Here's something
you might want to see.

150
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,959
He's...

151
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,041
Going...

152
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,291
Going to school?

153
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,041
Mm-hmm.

154
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:29,291
Good.

155
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:33,041
I could have Coop
bring him by this afternoon.

156
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,041
What do you think?

157
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:36,083
No.

158
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,625
It might be good,
for both of you.

159
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:40,709
I said no.

160
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,291
Don't...

161
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,917
Argue...

162
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:45,959
With a dying woman.

163
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,333
Is it true?

164
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,041
Mr. Wilson.

165
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,208
Is it true?
I heard some shrink

166
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,041
in this practice is defending
that murdering bitch in court.

167
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,458
Whoa. W--slow down.
What?

168
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,041
The prosecutors just told me

169
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:08,041
that Elise's lawyers are
getting a-a Sheldon Wallace

170
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,458
to testify in her defense.

171
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,458
You're my doctor, too.

172
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,875
You gave us a family,

173
00:06:12,917 --> 00:06:14,041
and now you're helping
the woman who took it away?

174
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,458
Elise was on suicide watch.

175
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,583
I only asked Dr. Wallace
to talk to her.

176
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,375
Do you remember Josie?

177
00:06:19,417 --> 00:06:21,041
She had red hair and freckles.

178
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,792
She was 4.

179
00:06:22,834 --> 00:06:24,375
Max was 2.

180
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,041
Still in diapers.

181
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,917
They were awake.

182
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:31,041
They must have been
so scared.

183
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:35,041
My wife murdered
our children.

184
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:38,375
She should rot in jail.

185
00:06:38,417 --> 00:06:40,041
And you should be
ashamed of yourself

186
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,041
for helping her at all.

187
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,041
You're the one who asked me

188
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,250
to talk to Elise
in the first place.

189
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,458
She was in jail and suicidal.

190
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,667
I asked you to help
with her mental state,

191
00:06:50,709 --> 00:06:51,875
not to work to set her free.

192
00:06:51,917 --> 00:06:53,041
What Elise did
was horrific.

193
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,250
It was beyond horrific.

194
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,375
It is possible that she had
a psychotic episode,

195
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:58,500
brought on by an undiagnosed
postpartum depression.

196
00:06:58,542 --> 00:07:00,041
You might be right,
but you should've come to me

197
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,750
before you agreed
to help her out.

198
00:07:01,792 --> 00:07:04,500
I'm not trying to justify
what she did.

199
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:06,208
I'm trying to shed light
on what happened.

200
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,041
Right, and the effect of that
could be a court

201
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,458
setting that woman free.

202
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,834
Okay, postpartum

203
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,875
is a real thing, all right?

204
00:07:12,917 --> 00:07:15,041
Jake, 80% of mothers suffer
from some form of it.

205
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,834
Yeah, but they don't asphyxiate
their own children.

206
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:19,041
Sam, you know how brutal
mental illness can be.

207
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,083
This is
a kind of mental illness.

208
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:22,458
Look, guys,
this is about Elise.

209
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,041
Sheldon, you can help her
all you want,

210
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,417
just don't defend
what she did in court.

211
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,417
Yes, well, I'm sorry, Jake,
but she's my patient now.

212
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,709
Okay? You don't get
to make that call.

213
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,875
Hey, you okay?

214
00:07:42,917 --> 00:07:46,542
Uh... I'm fine. Yeah.

215
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,375
How much longer
does she have?

216
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:50,291
I don't know.

217
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,500
Days maybe, but...

218
00:07:52,542 --> 00:07:54,041
It's still, uh...

219
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,166
Too long.

220
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,750
I'm wearing down.

221
00:07:57,792 --> 00:08:00,083
Well, because...

222
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:01,375
She's not just a patient.

223
00:08:01,417 --> 00:08:02,750
She's in your life,

224
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:04,500
which means you can't get
any emotional distance.

225
00:08:04,542 --> 00:08:06,041
And without that,
you're not a doctor anymore.

226
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,667
You're...

227
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:09,709
Well...

228
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,917
You're family.

229
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,500
I should be able
to do this.

230
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:20,625
There's no right way
to do it.

231
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,792
Just...

232
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:24,917
Be there.

233
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:30,250
Cooper's with Mason.

234
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:35,083
And I...

235
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,917
I...

236
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:51,417
You want to tell me
what's going on?

237
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:58,041
Curt and Elise came to me
three years ago.

238
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:01,834
They already had
a little girl--Josie.

239
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:05,208
But they had trouble
conceiving again, so...

240
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,041
After two rounds of I.V.F.,
they had Max.

241
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:10,333
After another year,
they, uh...

242
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:16,208
They said they were ready
for a third.

243
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:20,041
That one took a little longer,
but, um...

244
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,041
Every time Elise
came into the office,

245
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,041
curt would come with her.

246
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,667
They'd bring the kids.

247
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:29,625
I remember, uh...

248
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:32,291
Elise seemed a little off.

249
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:35,041
But with two kids and--and more
fertility treatments,

250
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:37,458
I-I figured,
she was overwhelmed

251
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,041
and affected by the hormones,

252
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,041
but she said
she could handle it.

253
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,875
My job
is to give people babies,

254
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:47,000
not judge whether
they should be parents.

255
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:51,750
So I...

256
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,834
I helped Elise

257
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,458
to get pregnant again.

258
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,750
There's no way anyone
could've known

259
00:09:58,792 --> 00:10:00,458
what Elise was going to do.

260
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,041
But I was her doctor.

261
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,333
I mean, I could've...

262
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,291
I could've been
more tuned in,

263
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,500
could've asked more questions.

264
00:10:07,542 --> 00:10:09,917
But instead, I shot her up
with fertility drugs

265
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:11,625
and probably made
the problem worse.

266
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:13,875
Jake...

267
00:10:13,917 --> 00:10:15,625
You didn't cause this.

268
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:17,875
You have no idea the effect
that medication had on her.

269
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,875
Except I know
that I made it possible

270
00:10:19,917 --> 00:10:21,709
for her to have
another baby.

271
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,041
Because of me, this woman

272
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,959
who killed her two children

273
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
is about to have another.

274
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,500
All right, spelling.
You obviously nailed that.

275
00:10:34,542 --> 00:10:36,166
Yeah.

276
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:38,125
Math, you got 8 out of 10.

277
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:40,166
What about
the other 2 points?

278
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:42,125
Kidding.

279
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:43,750
Good job
on your history.

280
00:10:43,792 --> 00:10:46,041
And a drawing...

281
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,083
Do you like it?
Yeah.

282
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,500
You and your mom?

283
00:10:49,542 --> 00:10:51,583
Whenever I'm scared,
she lets me get in her bed.

284
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,166
Then I'm not scared anymore.

285
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,959
That's great.
That is a great drawing.

286
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,750
I was thinking maybe you could
help me find a frame for it,

287
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:02,083
and we can put it in her room
for when she comes home.

288
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,041
Mase...

289
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,792
We talked about this.
She's not--

290
00:11:05,834 --> 00:11:07,709
she's...
She's not coming home.

291
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,917
She's dying.

292
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,375
That's what you said
last time in Seattle,

293
00:11:10,417 --> 00:11:12,000
but then the doctors
fixed her.

294
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:13,917
Right, but, Mason...

295
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:18,041
They can't help
your mom there anymore.

296
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,875
Nobody can.

297
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,000
Somebody will.

298
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,542
Why are you back?

299
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:32,875
I want to be left alone.

300
00:11:32,917 --> 00:11:34,458
I want to try to help
with your defense,

301
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,041
but to do that,
you have to talk to me.

302
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,041
I don't deserve your help.

303
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,959
Elise, you have to get
beyond the self-condemnation

304
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,041
and open up.

305
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,250
Don't you want to understand
what happened?

306
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:57,875
Curt was out--out of town
on business that week.

307
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,834
Max had been sick.

308
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,542
He wouldn't stop crying.

309
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,000
I took him to the doctor.

310
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,500
I did everything
that they told me to do,

311
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:06,834
but he just...

312
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:09,375
He wouldn't stop.

313
00:12:09,417 --> 00:12:11,500
Josie was upset because...

314
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:14,000
I couldn't give her
the attention that she needed.

315
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,208
Neither of them would sleep.

316
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,166
It took them hours
to go down,

317
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,041
and then...

318
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:23,041
They would wake up
over and over at night.

319
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,041
I was exhausted.

320
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,667
It was like torture.

321
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:29,917
And then I realized...

322
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:31,709
That it was my fault.

323
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,709
I had to have
done something wrong.

324
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,041
My children were...

325
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,458
Upset and in pain...

326
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,417
Because I was a bad mother,

327
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,834
a terrible mother,

328
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:48,041
which made it even harder
to watch them suffering.

329
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,542
So...

330
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:59,041
I told them that we were
going to the park.

331
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:00,959
I got them dressed,

332
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,875
and I put the sand toys
in the back,

333
00:13:02,917 --> 00:13:05,875
and I... I...

334
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:08,041
I put them in their car seats.

335
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,458
And I started the car.

336
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,166
And then I told them
that I was going to go back

337
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,041
and get their snacks.

338
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Ohh.

339
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:28,709
The pain and the guilt
that you feel now

340
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,083
is a reaction...

341
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,917
To what you did.

342
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,041
It's a rational reaction.

343
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,250
But what happened to you,
what you experienced that night

344
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:40,709
was something
completely different.

345
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,041
I think you had
a psychotic episode,

346
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:45,375
the result of years of
untreated postpartum depression,

347
00:13:45,417 --> 00:13:47,000
compounded by
a hormonal imbalance.

348
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,291
You're not the same woman
you were that night.

349
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,291
That night,
you were not rational.

350
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,417
You have to understand that,
and I have to help your lawyers

351
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,291
help the court
understand that.

352
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:58,000
I don't deserve your help.
I don't deserve anything!

353
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,041
No, I killed them!

354
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,917
I killed my babies!

355
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,041
I killed them! Oh!

356
00:14:08,542 --> 00:14:10,291
Call 9-1-1!

357
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,041
So how's he seem to you?

358
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,125
He seems like a little boy

359
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,125
who doesn't want to accept
that his mother's gonna die.

360
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,458
We've been as honest with him
as we could be.

361
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,625
I know.
I thought we--
I thought he understood.

362
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:33,458
Kids Mason's age
can't process a tragedy.

363
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,458
They'll often resort
to magical thinking.

364
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,041
But he already
said good-bye to her.

365
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,750
He knows that Charlotte's
at the hospital with Erica.

366
00:14:38,792 --> 00:14:41,125
He knows Erica's still alive.

367
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:43,834
I just don't think I should let
him keep thinking there's hope.

368
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:46,458
I think you've done
everything you can do.

369
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,208
But...

370
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,041
If I didn't know that Erica
had already refused,

371
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,041
I would say,
take him to the hospital.

372
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,709
Let him see his mom.
Let her explain.

373
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,000
Right.
I-I mean, I tried.

374
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,875
Charlotte tried.
Erica won't budge.

375
00:14:57,917 --> 00:14:59,250
Well, maybe take him anyway.

376
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:02,000
You can explain to him that
he--he can't see his mom,

377
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,709
but at least
he'll be close to her.

378
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,041
Then what?

379
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,375
And then hope like hell
Erica changes her mind

380
00:15:06,417 --> 00:15:08,041
before it's too late.

381
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,500
Oh. Stop. Stop.

382
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,667
Hush. Your mouth's
leaking like a faucet.

383
00:15:20,917 --> 00:15:23,041
Who cares?

384
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,959
You want to be drooly, fine.
But it's freaking me out.

385
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,750
I can't handle it,
sister.

386
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,041
Okay. Okay.

387
00:15:40,542 --> 00:15:42,083
Okay.

388
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:47,041
Here we go.

389
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,750
I'm sorry.

390
00:15:48,792 --> 00:15:50,917
Don't worry about it.

391
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,000
I'm scared.

392
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:10,458
I am gonna be here with you
the whole time.

393
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,125
I am here.

394
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:13,875
You're here.

395
00:16:13,917 --> 00:16:17,375
I'm here.

396
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,750
What happened?

397
00:16:26,792 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm Dr. Montgomery,
Elise.

398
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:30,625
You had
an eclamptic seizure.

399
00:16:30,667 --> 00:16:32,500
My baby--w--
is she okay?

400
00:16:32,542 --> 00:16:34,083
I did an ultrasound,

401
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,709
and you're on a fetal monitor.

402
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,083
The baby's gonna be fine.

403
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,709
I put you on medication

404
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,083
to get your blood pressure
under control

405
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,291
and make sure you don't
have another seizure.

406
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,041
Just as soon
as you're stable,

407
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,709
we'll go ahead
and induce labor.

408
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,917
How soon?

409
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,792
Hopefully tomorrow.
Should be routine.

410
00:16:48,834 --> 00:16:52,041
You'll deliver vaginally
unless there's a complication.

411
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:54,041
You'll have a few moments
with your baby,

412
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:56,041
and then she'll be
turned over to your husband.

413
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,333
As soon as you recover,

414
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,583
you'll be discharged
back to county.

415
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,542
The first time,
I was so happy.

416
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:06,875
Curt and I wanted a family
so much.

417
00:17:06,917 --> 00:17:09,750
But they don't tell you.
It's so hard.

418
00:17:09,792 --> 00:17:12,333
Wanting to be a mom

419
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:15,041
and having a baby...

420
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,875
They're different.

421
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:23,041
My babies deserved
something more...

422
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,583
Someone better than me.

423
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:28,875
I tried my best,
but I...

424
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:30,583
I wasn't good.

425
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:34,041
I wasn't...
A good mother.

426
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,917
And then, i--
and then I became...

427
00:17:48,709 --> 00:17:50,041
What are you doing here
so late?

428
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,458
I was just, uh, signing off
on a patient discharge.

429
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,041
Well, i-I'd invite you
for a cup of coffee,

430
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,458
but I gotta get back
to the E.R. soon.

431
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,083
Oh, no, no, no, no. I just
stopped by to say hello.

432
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,500
So hello.

433
00:17:58,542 --> 00:18:00,041
Hi.

434
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,834
M-Maybe we could
have lunch tomorrow.

435
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:05,083
I-I mean, unless you're
doing something with Scott.

436
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,166
No.

437
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:07,583
Oh, okay.

438
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,625
Uh, i--it's no problem.
I get it.

439
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:11,041
No, no, no.

440
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:14,500
I meant, no, I don't have plans
with Scott, because...

441
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:16,542
Scott and I broke up.

442
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,458
Yeah, I know.

443
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,834
You do?

444
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,208
Then why...

445
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,291
I was just--i was try--

446
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,917
I don't know. I was...

447
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:29,250
Pete.

448
00:18:31,542 --> 00:18:33,083
Well, I, um...

449
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,500
I do have
a lot of pat--

450
00:18:34,542 --> 00:18:37,625
I have patients
all day tomorrow, so...

451
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:39,041
Some other time then.

452
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,458
Okay.

453
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,333
Okay.

454
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,625
Okay.

455
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,250
Addison,
are you home?

456
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,959
Yeah, up here.

457
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:08,291
Surprise.

458
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:11,250
What happened
to your office?

459
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,375
I got rid of everything

460
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:15,458
so you could fill it up.

461
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,500
I figured we could put
the crib right over there,

462
00:19:17,542 --> 00:19:20,083
the changing table
right under the window

463
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,083
so you get plenty of fresh air,
and these...

464
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,417
These are
all of my baby books--

465
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:27,041
everything from what
to name your baby to,

466
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,083
oh, what weird food object
your baby

467
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,125
is the same size as
each week.

468
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,041
Some of them--
some of them are highlighted.

469
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:35,041
Actually--actually,
all of them are highlighted.

470
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:37,041
That--a lot of people
don't like that.

471
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,500
But this is supposed to be
your nursery.

472
00:19:38,542 --> 00:19:40,417
Doesn't matter.

473
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:44,709
I don't think I am
ever gonna have a baby.

474
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,375
But the universe works
in amazing ways,

475
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:49,083
and you...

476
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,041
Are.

477
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:55,375
I'm sorry. All this is...
Wonderful, Addie.

478
00:19:55,417 --> 00:19:58,250
I just--
this is too fast.

479
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:01,500
And I'm not ready.

480
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,875
Okay.

481
00:20:07,917 --> 00:20:10,000
Where's my mom?

482
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,000
Right upstairs.

483
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,834
This isn't fair, buddy.

484
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:18,041
This is just--
it's nowhere near fair.

485
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,625
And I wish I could keep

486
00:20:19,667 --> 00:20:23,667
all the bad things
in the world away from you.

487
00:20:23,709 --> 00:20:25,166
But I can't.

488
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:28,041
I'm just so sorry
about that.

489
00:20:29,542 --> 00:20:31,709
Dad, if there's no cure,

490
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:35,125
how's my mom
gonna get better?

491
00:20:36,709 --> 00:20:39,041
I-I read this story once
about a grandma

492
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,709
who got sick.

493
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,417
And the entire family prayed,

494
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:45,709
and she got better.

495
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,458
Should we be doing that?

496
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,500
Does praying help?

497
00:20:49,542 --> 00:20:51,875
Sometimes, yeah.

498
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,917
Can you teach me?

499
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:57,458
Yeah, um...

500
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,875
Let's see.

501
00:20:58,917 --> 00:21:01,750
I think you start by folding
your hands together.

502
00:21:01,792 --> 00:21:03,500
You, too.

503
00:21:03,542 --> 00:21:05,083
Okay.

504
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,542
Um...

505
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:10,709
And then you just... talk

506
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:15,667
about your life
and about what you want.

507
00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:17,000
Aren't you supposed
to kneel?

508
00:21:18,792 --> 00:21:20,542
Uh, uh, I don't.

509
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,333
Then I won't.

510
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:24,375
Okay.

511
00:21:49,417 --> 00:21:51,083
Amen.

512
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:53,000
Amen.

513
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:54,083
Dad.

514
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,333
Mm-hmm.

515
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:57,375
Did I do it right? Do you
think god heard me?

516
00:21:57,417 --> 00:21:59,291
Yeah, I do.

517
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:08,375
Hey.

518
00:22:08,417 --> 00:22:09,792
Hey. Another session
with the crazy cat lady?

519
00:22:09,834 --> 00:22:11,166
Uh, no.
Combative schizophrenic.

520
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:12,583
Apparently, I look like
his mother,

521
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,000
and, uh, he hates his mother.

522
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,166
Took two nurses
and a security guard

523
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:17,792
to hold him while I pushed
the haloperidol.

524
00:22:17,834 --> 00:22:19,000
Coffee or tea?

525
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:21,083
Tea. Um, so, uh,

526
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:23,291
Pete and I ran into
each other last night.

527
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:24,917
Mm-hmm.

528
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:27,041
I think he wanted
to kiss me.

529
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:28,166
Did you let him?

530
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:29,917
No.
Violet.

531
00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:31,041
Oh, I wanted to,
believe me.

532
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,375
But?

533
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:33,792
Well, I just--
it seemed lazy after,

534
00:22:33,834 --> 00:22:35,041
you know,
everything we've been through.

535
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:36,417
Yeah.
Maybe you're right.

536
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:38,250
Every time
Sam and I'd have a fight,

537
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:39,875
he'd show up later

538
00:22:39,917 --> 00:22:41,625
all sexy,
smelling like cookies.

539
00:22:41,667 --> 00:22:42,959
And what would you do?

540
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,625
Oof. I fell for it,
every single time.

541
00:22:45,667 --> 00:22:47,250
Well, maybe
I'm overthinking this.

542
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:49,250
Mm. I don't know.
Didn't work for us.

543
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:52,250
Turns out, some problems
are too big for even...

544
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:54,291
Mind-blowing sex to solve.

545
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:02,750
Mm.

546
00:23:02,792 --> 00:23:04,667
Hey.

547
00:23:04,709 --> 00:23:06,208
Thank you.

548
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,250
You two doing okay?

549
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:10,250
I couldn't get him
to go home last night, but...

550
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:13,041
How's Erica doing?

551
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:15,083
It's almost over.

552
00:23:20,542 --> 00:23:22,667
Hey, sweetie.

553
00:23:22,709 --> 00:23:24,041
You want to head home
for a while,

554
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:25,375
maybe sleep
in your own bed?

555
00:23:25,417 --> 00:23:27,250
I think I kinda want
to stay here.

556
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:29,041
Is that okay?
Of course.

557
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:30,291
Oh, um...

558
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:32,667
I have something
for my mom.

559
00:23:32,709 --> 00:23:34,041
Uh, do you mind
giving it to her?

560
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:35,291
Sure.

561
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:37,458
I didn't get to frame it,
but, um, I was thinking,

562
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,041
maybe if she saw it,
she wouldn't feel so alone.

563
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:43,709
Well, that's real sweet.

564
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:47,625
Hey, uh, maybe I could
hang out with you for a while

565
00:23:47,667 --> 00:23:49,834
so your dad can go
take care of some things.

566
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:51,000
Okay.

567
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,458
You need
to go see Erica.

568
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,041
Now?

569
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:01,291
Now.

570
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:18,500
Hey.

571
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,667
Hi.

572
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:29,041
I'm so sorry you were alone
all those years,

573
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:31,291
raising Mason.

574
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:35,125
I wish I'd known. I wish
I'd been able to help.

575
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:37,333
But this kid
that you raised?

576
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:41,375
My god, Erica,
he's amazing.

577
00:24:41,417 --> 00:24:44,125
And you did that.

578
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:47,000
You.

579
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:56,500
And I am so grateful
you brought him to me.

580
00:25:07,166 --> 00:25:10,041
Thank you for that.

581
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:19,333
I'm so... glad you're...

582
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:23,583
His dad.

583
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,041
Come on, judi.
You're almost there.

584
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:30,041
Did you page me?

585
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:31,250
Yeah. I thought
you should see this.

586
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,667
What's happening?

587
00:25:33,709 --> 00:25:35,417
Just your
garden-variety miracle.

588
00:25:35,458 --> 00:25:36,625
Ah!

589
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:38,542
It's okay.
You can do this...

590
00:25:39,792 --> 00:25:41,250
Judi.

591
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:43,250
I'm just here
for moral support.

592
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,667
I'm having a--oh--
a boy.

593
00:25:45,709 --> 00:25:47,208
And he's almost here.
Push.

594
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,542
Good.

595
00:25:48,583 --> 00:25:49,875
There.

596
00:25:49,917 --> 00:25:51,041
Ohh.
There he is.

597
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:52,875
Good.

598
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:55,583
Ohh.

599
00:26:00,583 --> 00:26:02,041
He's perfect.

600
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:08,208
Can you believe I got to
do that seven times today?

601
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,917
He's beautiful.

602
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:11,208
And your baby
will be, too.

603
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:14,125
Shh.

604
00:26:16,917 --> 00:26:20,041
I just watched Addison
deliver a baby,

605
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:22,041
which is about the thousandth
time I've seen it,

606
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:24,250
but...

607
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,417
But what?

608
00:26:26,458 --> 00:26:29,166
But nothing. It...

609
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:30,792
It was surreal.

610
00:26:30,834 --> 00:26:32,709
Yeah, I remember watching
Maya being born.

611
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,041
It was--
it was magical.

612
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:37,834
I can understand why--
why Addison wants it so badly.

613
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:40,750
Mm. Well, not anymore.

614
00:26:40,792 --> 00:26:42,959
What do you mean?

615
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,625
She told me, she's given up
on having a baby.

616
00:26:46,667 --> 00:26:49,041
Elise's labor
is progressing quickly.

617
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:50,959
She should give birth
relatively soon.

618
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,875
She'll get to spend
a little time with the baby,

619
00:26:52,917 --> 00:26:54,667
and then--
the second my daughter
is born,

620
00:26:54,709 --> 00:26:55,875
you bring her to me.

621
00:26:55,917 --> 00:26:57,250
Are you sure
this is what you want?

622
00:26:57,291 --> 00:26:59,959
Look, I'm not defending Elise.
I'm not defending myself.

623
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,417
This never should've happened.

624
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:03,959
But you and Elise are about
to have another baby together.

625
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,291
You know, everyone is so
concerned with Elise's feelings.

626
00:27:07,333 --> 00:27:08,917
Well, what about mine?

627
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:10,917
What about
my right as a father

628
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:13,083
to watch my children
grow up?

629
00:27:13,125 --> 00:27:14,375
Curt...

630
00:27:14,417 --> 00:27:17,166
If Elise is set free
because of that shrink,

631
00:27:17,208 --> 00:27:18,500
I will sue you.

632
00:27:18,542 --> 00:27:20,000
I will sue all of you.

633
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:21,959
I'll ruin you.

634
00:27:26,083 --> 00:27:28,083
Elise,
on the count of three,

635
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:30,041
I need you to start
really bearing down, okay?

636
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:31,125
Mm-hmm.

637
00:27:31,166 --> 00:27:33,667
Okay. One, two, three.

638
00:27:33,709 --> 00:27:35,041
Push.

639
00:27:35,083 --> 00:27:37,667
Oh, it hurts.
I can't do it.

640
00:27:37,709 --> 00:27:39,500
Elise,
you have to keep going.

641
00:27:39,542 --> 00:27:41,083
No, I can't.

642
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:43,417
I can't.
I can't be a mother again.

643
00:27:43,458 --> 00:27:46,375
Elise, I need you
to look at me, okay?

644
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,959
I know that you're scared,

645
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,959
but your baby needs you
right now.

646
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,375
You can do this for her.
I know you can.

647
00:27:56,625 --> 00:27:59,041
So on my count.

648
00:27:59,083 --> 00:28:01,834
One, two, three.

649
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:03,041
Push.

650
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:05,041
Good. Good, Elise.
I can see the head.

651
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:08,083
I just need
one more big push.

652
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:10,834
Good.

653
00:28:10,875 --> 00:28:12,667
There she is.

654
00:28:12,709 --> 00:28:13,875
Ohh.

655
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:19,709
Look at your beautiful baby...
Elise.

656
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:24,041
Elise.

657
00:28:26,834 --> 00:28:28,792
Elise, do you want
to look at your daughter?

658
00:28:28,834 --> 00:28:30,000
She's--

659
00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:34,959
I'm sorry.

660
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,458
I'm so sorry.

661
00:28:38,709 --> 00:28:40,709
Do you want to name her?

662
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:45,917
Her father should do that.

663
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:50,667
Shh.

664
00:28:50,709 --> 00:28:52,709
Elise.

665
00:28:54,625 --> 00:28:55,917
You did a really good job.

666
00:29:16,917 --> 00:29:20,000
God, she's so beautiful.

667
00:29:22,083 --> 00:29:23,291
Hey.

668
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,667
She looks just Elise.

669
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:39,291
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

670
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:43,500
We were supposed to be
a family.

671
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,125
How could she do this to us?

672
00:29:47,166 --> 00:29:48,667
Yeah.

673
00:29:48,709 --> 00:29:50,458
I don't know if you can
ever forgive Elise,

674
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:54,709
but you have to try
not to... not to hate her.

675
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,291
At least right now,
because right now,

676
00:29:56,333 --> 00:29:59,000
she is
the mother of this...

677
00:29:59,041 --> 00:30:02,500
Beautiful new daughter
of yours.

678
00:30:02,542 --> 00:30:04,291
And this baby deserves
a fresh start,

679
00:30:04,333 --> 00:30:05,542
just like you do.

680
00:30:07,083 --> 00:30:10,083
It's okay. Shh.

681
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:11,750
How's Elise?

682
00:30:11,792 --> 00:30:13,291
She's doing okay
for a woman

683
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:15,250
who just had to
give up her baby.

684
00:30:15,291 --> 00:30:17,500
She couldn't even bring herself
to hold her.

685
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:28,750
Shh. Shh.

686
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:55,166
How did Elise's delivery go?

687
00:30:55,208 --> 00:30:57,792
It was rough,
but she got through it.

688
00:30:57,834 --> 00:30:59,834
Okay, good.
I'll check on her.

689
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:02,041
It's good that
she has you, Sheldon.

690
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:04,041
Hey, do you think--i mean,

691
00:31:04,083 --> 00:31:07,959
is it possible for her
to ever get past what she did?

692
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,041
I don't know, but I don't
plan to give up on her.

693
00:31:10,083 --> 00:31:12,750
How's Jake?

694
00:31:12,792 --> 00:31:14,542
Sounds like he might need
some help moving on, too.

695
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:17,625
Thanks.

696
00:31:19,166 --> 00:31:21,000
Hello.

697
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:29,542
Erica, it's Charlotte.

698
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:34,667
I brought you something.

699
00:31:34,709 --> 00:31:38,458
It's a... a drawing
Mason did.

700
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,667
It's the two of you together.

701
00:31:40,709 --> 00:31:42,041
It's really beautiful.

702
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:44,417
He wanted you to have it
in here.

703
00:31:47,041 --> 00:31:50,375
Okay, you just...
You try to relax.

704
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,041
Erica, I'm gonna
tell you something,

705
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:55,709
and I know it's not
quite fair to you,

706
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:58,792
but... Mason needs
to see you.

707
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:00,542
He won't be able
to move on otherwise,

708
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:02,041
and I know it's not
what you want,

709
00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:04,250
but it is the only thing
I can do for him,

710
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:07,458
and he has to come first now.

711
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:11,333
Our son needs to see you.

712
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:19,041
I'm gonna go get him.
You just--you hang in there.
