00:00:06,834 --> 00:00:09,917
Archer and I
were terrible sailors.

3
00:00:09,959 --> 00:00:13,333
Heh,
it broke the captain's heart.

4
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:14,834
Every time we'd tack,

5
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:17,542
that's when you turn
the sailboat across the wind,

6
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:19,750
the captain would yell out,
"ready about!"

7
00:00:19,792 --> 00:00:21,583
And Archer and I would go
and get ready.

8
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:22,959
And then "hard alee!"

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,208
Which is when you push
the tiller hard to the Lee side.

10
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,583
Anyway, if you do it right,

11
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:29,208
you pick up good wind
and everything's fine.

12
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,041
But if you do it wrong,
as we often did,

13
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:34,000
you'd wind up in irons.

14
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:35,542
What's "in irons"?

15
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:38,792
It's when you're
pointing straight at the wind.

16
00:00:38,834 --> 00:00:43,041
And you can try and fight,
but you are stuck.

17
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:48,458
Thank you for staying over.

18
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,458
This was fun.

19
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,000
Well, I thought so, heh.

20
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:54,417
I mean, I know that staying up
all night talking and not...

21
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:55,709
Doing it?
Right.

22
00:00:56,959 --> 00:00:58,041
It's fine.
It's not.

23
00:00:58,083 --> 00:00:59,875
It is fine.
It's not fine.

24
00:00:59,917 --> 00:01:02,083
I know you wanted to do it.
I just...

25
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:05,041
I'm not sure if I'm ready,
you know? I just...

26
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:09,041
I just got separated
and, you know, you are...

27
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:12,500
You are very...
What?

28
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:15,000
Young?

29
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:25,041
Violet, this is your issue,
it's not mine.

30
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:28,500
You're right, you're right,
you're right.

31
00:01:31,542 --> 00:01:34,750
Do you wanna stay a little
longer and eat some breakfast?

32
00:01:34,792 --> 00:01:36,000
Mm-hm.

33
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,208
You excited?

34
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:58,291
I am
cautiously optimistic.

35
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:00,041
Today you meet
the surrogate candidates?

36
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:02,375
- So I'm told.
- I have narrowed it down

37
00:02:02,417 --> 00:02:04,917
to a couple of women who I think
would be a good fit for her.

38
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,083
Oh. No. It's like when
the guy buys you a sweater.

39
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:09,667
It's fluffy, tight and low cut.

40
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:11,542
What women want
and what men think they want--

41
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:13,458
there are criteria
they have to meet.

42
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,750
They have given birth to their
child whom they are raising.

43
00:02:15,792 --> 00:02:17,250
Really want a car
with all that mileage?

44
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:19,291
We have to make sure that she's
gone

45
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:22,041
through a healthy pregnancy,
devoid of major complications.

46
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:23,750
Exactly.
It's also essential

47
00:02:23,792 --> 00:02:25,500
that the surrogate knows
how she's gonna feel

48
00:02:25,542 --> 00:02:27,709
- being pregnant and giving birth.
- Makes sense.

49
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,542
You don't want her to run away
with the baby.

50
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,291
Thank you.
Heh.

51
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,333
Thank you, Amelia.
Now I can worry about that.

52
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:35,166
We're going
through an agency.

53
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:36,500
Everything's aboveboard.

54
00:02:36,542 --> 00:02:39,000
There will be a contract.
It'll be fine.

55
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:40,542
You're right. Yeah.

56
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:43,041
Because so far getting pregnant,
ivf, adoption,

57
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:44,917
it's all gone so swimmingly.

58
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,834
I've been a smashing success
on all fronts. Heh.

59
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:53,917
Thanks.

60
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:55,333
Morning.

61
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:58,417
Violet?

62
00:03:00,542 --> 00:03:01,917
Good morning, heh.

63
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:04,083
Why are you grinning at me?
I'm happy to see you?

64
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,625
You've never said that
to me before.

65
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:08,542
Maybe I should change that.
Hmm.

66
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,125
Someone rung your bell
last night.

67
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,333
Charlotte,
nobody rang anything.

68
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,458
I'm not asking for details,
I'm just saying.

69
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,792
Whoever he is and whatever
he's doing, keep him around.

70
00:03:17,834 --> 00:03:19,917
It's a nice version of you.

71
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,792
Violet?

72
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:32,125
Joanna.
Help me.

73
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:34,041
- I need some help here.
- Stay with me.

74
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:37,166
I need an iv set-up
and a gurney.

75
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,041
- Right away.
- Can you hear me?

76
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,667
- She's diaphoretic.
- Joanna?

77
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:42,792
Can you tell us what happened?

78
00:03:42,834 --> 00:03:44,291
My baby.

79
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,041
- Are you pregnant, Joanna?
- It's okay.

80
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,500
Shh. Joanna? Stay with me.
It's okay.

81
00:03:50,542 --> 00:03:52,875
Joanna? Hey.

82
00:03:52,917 --> 00:03:55,125
Joanna. Joanna.

83
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,792
I never would have met Mason
if Erica wasn't sick.

84
00:04:03,834 --> 00:04:07,000
I never would have known I had
this amazing son out there.

85
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,041
But you do know.

86
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,041
So now we need to focus on
what we need to focus on.

87
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,875
She went to two specialists,
there was nothing they could do.

88
00:04:12,917 --> 00:04:15,333
If she doesn't wanna fight--
you're gonna let her give up?

89
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:17,083
Amelia is a world-class
neurosurgeon.

90
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:20,667
Erica knows that,
and she said no.

91
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:22,750
I can't kidnap her
and force her into an mri.

92
00:04:22,792 --> 00:04:24,291
One of the most annoying things
about you

93
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,834
is that you don't give up.

94
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,041
I don't know
what to do here.

95
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,250
This is Dr. King.

96
00:04:30,542 --> 00:04:33,041
Yeah, I'll be right there.
I gotta go.

97
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,166
What am I supposed to do?
Think of something.

98
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,458
Thirty-seven year old female.

99
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,250
Unconscious with blunt trauma
to the face and abdomen.

100
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,667
Wide-bore iv times two,

101
00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:44,709
- cross and hold four units.
- She's pregnant.

102
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,041
I need an ultrasound.

103
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,250
Brain scan and trauma panel.

104
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,500
Her husband did this.

105
00:04:48,542 --> 00:04:50,041
I met Joanna six months ago
in an airport.

106
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,500
She was afraid to go back
to New York

107
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:53,125
because he hit her
during an argument.

108
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:56,250
- There's blood in her belly.
- The baby looks 12 weeks old.

109
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,375
Get the police.
She told you that he hit her?

110
00:04:58,417 --> 00:05:01,041
- She didn't have to.
- What's going on?

111
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,291
Who's that?
Husband. You should not be here.

112
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,166
How did this happen?
She was beaten badly.

113
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,291
I need to be with her.
That's not gonna happen.

114
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,291
I don't understand.
You did this.

115
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,291
You don't have to play innocent.
What? No.

116
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,917
When you talked at the airport
and made her stay?

117
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,250
That was my wake-up call.

118
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,500
I got help,
and I've been doing the work.

119
00:05:17,542 --> 00:05:20,250
Anger management, therapy.
Jo and I are doing much better.

120
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,166
I swear to you,
this isn't... it wasn't me.

121
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:23,291
I need to be with her.

122
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,208
Hey.
Get your hands off of me.

123
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,709
You don't even know me.
Back up.

124
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,041
Dr. Wilder, that is enough.

125
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,041
Hey.
Hey.

126
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,000
I heard you guys
had quite a night out.

127
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:40,542
Ah. Sorry
you couldn't make it.

128
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:47,000
Yeah. I also heard it was,
uh, pretty successful?

129
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,417
Cooper?

130
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:51,583
Heh. He was very impressed.

131
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:54,041
Look, I'm not trying to have
everybody know about that.

132
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,417
Of course.
It was a one-time thing.

133
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,041
Oh, are you retiring
from the league of men

134
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,834
sleeping with
20-something supermodels?

135
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,333
Because if
there's a spot on the roster...

136
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:04,000
No, I'm just...
I'm looking for something real.

137
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,875
You know what I mean.
I feel the same.

138
00:06:05,917 --> 00:06:08,041
Hey, hey, hey.
What's going on, fellas?

139
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,041
What's happening?

140
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,750
- Everything good?
- Yes.

141
00:06:10,792 --> 00:06:12,333
We were discussing
where to meet

142
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,667
smart, beautiful,
eligible women

143
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:18,000
to take our minds off the smart,
beautiful, unavailable women.

144
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:19,875
- The million-dollar question.
- Mm-hm.

145
00:06:19,917 --> 00:06:22,041
If you can get beyond
the cheese factor,

146
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:23,333
I've always loved the gym.

147
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,375
Unlike a bar,
if you don't have any luck,

148
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:28,792
at least you're getting
a workout in.

149
00:06:28,834 --> 00:06:31,625
Well, I do enjoy multi-tasking.

150
00:06:38,917 --> 00:06:40,041
What's going on with Joanna?

151
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,375
She's unconscious.
Her blood pressure is down,

152
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:44,041
and she's bleeding
into her abdomen.

153
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,458
What does that mean?
Is the baby okay?

154
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,667
I couldn't find
the baby's heartbeat.

155
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:49,041
I'm so sorry.

156
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:52,458
But because of the trauma,
Joanna lost the baby.

157
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,083
Look, I know
that this is awful,

158
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:56,250
but we need to make a decision
right now.

159
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,667
There's a tear in Joanna's
uterine wall.

160
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,875
I might have to do
a hysterectomy to stabilize her.

161
00:07:00,917 --> 00:07:02,250
Do the hysterectomy.

162
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,709
If I stop the bleeding, I might
save her uterus and her life.

163
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,542
Might?
It's riskier, but I think--

164
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:09,250
do the hysterectomy.
You can't listen. He did this.

165
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:10,500
Shut the hell up.

166
00:07:10,542 --> 00:07:12,083
Watch it.
Please.

167
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,500
She can live without a uterus,
I can't live without Joanna.

168
00:07:14,542 --> 00:07:16,125
You're a liar.

169
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:19,959
He's her husband.
It's his decision to make.

170
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,208
Take her uterus out
and save her life.

171
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,250
He's the one who beat her.

172
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:35,166
You cannot let him decide
what's best for Joanna.

173
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,291
It's not up to me.
She's unconscious,

174
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,083
the law says
her husband gets to decide.

175
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,000
We don't know what happened.
She told me. David hit her.

176
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:43,583
Once that we know of,
six months ago.

177
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,083
If he hit her once,
he hit her again.

178
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,667
What do you think
else happened?

179
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:49,083
This is as hard for me
as it is for anyone else here,

180
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,792
but the police will sort it out,
sooner rather than later.

181
00:07:51,834 --> 00:07:53,709
Until that
or she regains consciousness,

182
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,041
we have to follow the law.

183
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,083
Unfortunately, that means
listening to David Gibson.

184
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:59,583
This is not the time
to cover your ass, Charlotte.

185
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:00,875
Really, Pete?

186
00:08:00,917 --> 00:08:03,041
Joanna wants kids, okay?
She told me she does.

187
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,917
Maybe that baby wasn't David's
or maybe he didn't want it,

188
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,083
but you cannot go in there

189
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,709
and take her chance for becoming
a mother. That lets him win.

190
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,083
This isn't any disagreement
Joanna and David had.

191
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,542
It's about saving Joanna.
And David isn't wrong.

192
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:17,125
Removing her uterus
might be the safest course.

193
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:20,000
Not to mention that if Addison
tries to save her uterus,

194
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,000
but Joanna dies and it turns out
David didn't do it,

195
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,750
it's not just gonna be my ass
that needs covering.

196
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:34,166
"Decidedly, I can't draw back.
But at least if I am killed,

197
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:36,709
I shall be killed
by a musketeer."

198
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,291
Heh, good job.

199
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,041
Can we read
another chapter?

200
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,083
Actually that's enough
for today.

201
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:44,333
You have a closet to clean.

202
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,250
All for one...
And one for all.

203
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,041
What's this?

204
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,041
I spoke to my lawyer,

205
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,667
and I got all the paperwork

206
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,625
to make sure that, uh,
I'll be Mason's legal guardian

207
00:09:05,667 --> 00:09:08,667
in the event of, uh...

208
00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:10,542
In the event of the situation
we're actually in.

209
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,125
Um, do we have
to deal with this now?

210
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,875
I wanna make sure
that there's no custody issues.

211
00:09:15,917 --> 00:09:18,458
Oh, come on, Cooper.
We don't deal with this, Mason,

212
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,208
he could end up
in the care of the state.

213
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,625
I, uh, will sign it later.
Later when?

214
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:28,000
Later.

215
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:36,041
I don't think
that you are preparing, Erica.

216
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:40,166
I am preparing. I brought him
to see you, didn't I?

217
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:43,000
I told you I was sick.
After Charlotte found out.

218
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,041
Look, come here.

219
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,709
If you were really preparing,

220
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,083
you would be
taking care of details.

221
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:56,125
Your will would be done. We'd be
talking about Mason's future.

222
00:09:56,166 --> 00:10:00,041
That's what you do
when you've accepted your fate.

223
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,875
But you're not there yet.

224
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:04,041
Acceptance is not a stage
that you have reached.

225
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:08,291
Which means
you have not given up.

226
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:12,333
I think you still have hope,
Erica.

227
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,291
Don't waste it.

228
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,291
Uh...

229
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:28,625
Is, uh, what's-her-name really
better than those other doctors?

230
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,709
It's better this way.
We doctor, they investigate.

231
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,667
Don't worry,
they'll find out what happened.

232
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:44,875
How'd it go?

233
00:10:44,917 --> 00:10:46,333
She's still sedated,
lost a lot of blood,

234
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,709
but she's gonna make it.
Thanks, Addison.

235
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,458
- How is she? How's Joanna?
- She's gonna be okay.

236
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,041
I was able
to control the bleeding

237
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,875
without having to perform
a hysterectomy.

238
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:59,041
Really? That's great.
What? I thought you said--

239
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,375
That's a good thing.
Just a second.

240
00:11:01,417 --> 00:11:04,041
I specifically told you
not to take that risk.

241
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:07,291
I don't-- you had no right.
You shouldn't have any rights.

242
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,041
Calm down.
I've done nothing wrong.

243
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,375
Because your wife is still
recovering from what you did,

244
00:11:12,417 --> 00:11:14,208
and she can't tell us
what happened.

245
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,417
As soon as Joanna's stable,
I'm moving her.

246
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:19,083
It's gonna take time.
Not when my lawyer's involved.

247
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,208
That's not necessary.
No, clearly it is.

248
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,083
I've been assaulted
by a doctor in this hospital.

249
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:25,041
I'm treated
like a criminal here.

250
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,500
We will transfer her
as soon as possible.

251
00:11:27,542 --> 00:11:29,417
Officer,
can you do anything?

252
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:30,750
As far as I understand it,

253
00:11:30,792 --> 00:11:32,458
you didn't witness
the first alleged attack.

254
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,041
Mrs. Gibson never filed a report
or a restraining order.

255
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:37,000
Mr. Gibson
has no history of violence.

256
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,625
And there are no witnesses
to account for what happened.

257
00:11:39,667 --> 00:11:41,667
You cannot allow him
to take her.

258
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:44,041
My department will continue
to investigate this,

259
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,417
but without evidence,

260
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,583
until the victim wakes up
and files a complaint,

261
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,166
my hands are tied.

262
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:04,041
I'm so sorry. I had an emergency
surgery. I'm Addison, heh.

263
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,041
Donna was just telling me
about her husband

264
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,709
who's stationed
on an aircraft carrier.

265
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,291
Oh, that's terrific.

266
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:12,917
He's a Navy pilot and we're
proud, but it's challenging.

267
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,834
We have two great kids,
10 and 6.

268
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:17,041
But they miss their dad,
and it's busy for me.

269
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:20,041
So, uh, being a surrogate
would...?

270
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,875
Will help out financially.

271
00:12:21,917 --> 00:12:24,250
Being a surrogate is noble,
but it's a business.

272
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,625
You're a professional,
Dr. Montgomery,

273
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:29,875
you must recognize that
I have a valuable skill set

274
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,875
that I wanna put to work
for you.

275
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,750
Hello.
Hey.

276
00:12:40,792 --> 00:12:43,083
How'd it go
with the surrogate?

277
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:46,208
She's very business-like.

278
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,125
Well, that's good, right?
Oh.

279
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,542
No, I mean, you want her

280
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,709
to carry the child and give it
to you, not be the mother.

281
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,041
That'll be your job.
Okay.

282
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:56,500
And your job is to tell me
everything's gonna be fine.

283
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,458
I'm gonna know the right
surrogate when I meet her.

284
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,333
I don't think it's about
finding the right one,

285
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:01,625
it's finding a good one.

286
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:05,041
Hey, um, do you know, um...?

287
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:08,667
Do you know this, um, young--?

288
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:11,667
This, uh, paramedic
named Scott?

289
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:14,125
Hot Scott?
Heh, yes.

290
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,375
Violet.
I know. It's so crazy.

291
00:13:16,417 --> 00:13:19,583
What? What's crazy?
He's young and, you know...

292
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:22,166
What the hell am I doing?
Are you having fun?

293
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,709
Yes.
Good.

294
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,750
Young is great.
Young is virile.

295
00:13:26,792 --> 00:13:28,166
Virile young buck.

296
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,500
Oh, Violet, gosh.
You like him, he likes you.

297
00:13:30,542 --> 00:13:34,083
Don't think about it and enjoy.
You deserve it. Hmm.

298
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:37,083
Sorry, doctors,
but Joanna Gibson? She's awake.

299
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,375
The gliosarcoma has grown
considerably

300
00:13:41,417 --> 00:13:43,375
since the last scans.
Because of its size

301
00:13:43,417 --> 00:13:45,792
and its proximity to
the intracranial blood supply,

302
00:13:45,834 --> 00:13:48,291
surgical intervention
is unlikely to succeed.

303
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:52,000
So the sky is blue,
and tacos taste great.

304
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,792
Tell me something
I don't already know.

305
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:56,083
Is this impossible to treat
or just impossible to cure?

306
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,792
The best we can do
is aggressive radiation therapy

307
00:13:58,834 --> 00:14:01,083
with combination chemotherapy
to slow the tumor's growth.

308
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,417
Maybe that could give Erica
six months or so,

309
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,375
depending on the efficacy
of the chemotherapy.

310
00:14:05,417 --> 00:14:07,041
Six months
of what kind of life?

311
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:09,041
Honestly? Rough.

312
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,709
Any time you do chemo,
there are side effects:

313
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,417
Fatigue, nausea, infection.

314
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:16,542
But the most important thing in
cancer treatment is buying time.

315
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:19,041
Because there's always progress
being made.

316
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:21,125
There's new trials, new drugs.
Come on, Cooper.

317
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:23,166
You really think they're gonna
have a cure for cancer

318
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:24,333
in six months?

319
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:28,709
Look, I came, I listened,
I'm done.

320
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,458
What did you do with Mason
on his last birthday?

321
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,208
What?
No, just tell me.

322
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,041
We did go-karts.
He loves driving.

323
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,417
He can't wait
to get his license.

324
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,083
And what's he wanna do
on his next birthday?

325
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,458
Screw you.

326
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,583
If you don't want to believe
in a miracle, that's fine.

327
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:52,917
But you could give Mason
one more birthday together,

328
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,709
one more summer vacation,
one more Christmas.

329
00:14:55,750 --> 00:15:01,041
And that's not much,
it's not enough,

330
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,834
but it would mean
everything to him.

331
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:33,750
Ugh, I feel like we're
two sides of a poetic debate.

332
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:35,041
I mean, which is better?

333
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:37,291
To have loved and lost
or to have never loved at all.

334
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,917
You don't have to fight
the memories.

335
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,041
Don't discount
the agony of regret.

336
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:44,083
I mean, if only I had said yes
when Amelia was interested...

337
00:15:45,542 --> 00:15:48,625
The imagination is a powerful
tool of self-torture.

338
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:52,458
Okay.
This isn't working for me.

339
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,667
Me neither.

340
00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:54,959
Hi.

341
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:59,041
Hi, i'm, uh, I'm Sam.

342
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,041
Hi, Sam.
Hey.

343
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,667
Are you done with that bike?

344
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:05,709
There's a time limit
on the cardio equipment.

345
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:09,792
Oh. Okay. Sorry.

346
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:16,000
David didn't want a baby.

347
00:16:17,792 --> 00:16:21,083
I thought it would help us
start over.

348
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:27,125
I planned this
special breakfast to tell him.

349
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:32,291
Poached eggs and orange juice
from the tree in my mom's...

350
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,083
My mom died.

351
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,041
Oh, I'm so sorry.

352
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:43,125
It's better. If she saw this,
if she knew her grandchild...

353
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:53,125
I was so excited
to be pregnant.

354
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,959
I just figured
he would be too.

355
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:03,000
But he wasn't.

356
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,959
It happened so fast.

357
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,291
I...

358
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,875
I got up to get him more food,

359
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:21,125
and when I turned around,
I saw his fist coming at me,

360
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:25,375
but it was in slow motion.
I, uh, couldn't move.

361
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,875
He killed our baby.

362
00:17:36,834 --> 00:17:39,041
Joanna, the police wanna
build a case against David,

363
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,625
but they're gonna need
your statement.

364
00:17:40,667 --> 00:17:44,083
I, uh, don't wanna do that.

365
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:46,834
Joanna, I will help you do it.

366
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:49,625
I will be with you
every step of the way.

367
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:50,709
I know you're scared,
but--

368
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,250
I'm not scared.
I am furious.

369
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:54,291
And I understand that but--

370
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:59,041
no, Violet, you can't.
He hit me.

371
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,875
He came at me,
and he punched me in the face.

372
00:18:01,917 --> 00:18:05,834
My husband
punched me in the face.

373
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:08,667
There was nothing I could do.
David needs to go to jail.

374
00:18:08,709 --> 00:18:11,542
No. He beat me.

375
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,250
And he killed my baby.

376
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:17,709
No. No.

377
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:23,041
No, I want him dead.
I, uh, want him to die.

378
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,875
Joanna...

379
00:18:24,917 --> 00:18:26,375
I wanna kill him.

380
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,125
I'm gonna kill him.

381
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:41,417
So she said she wanted
to kill David?

382
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:42,875
Who, Joanna?

383
00:18:42,917 --> 00:18:45,041
I hope that wasn't the statement
she gave the police.

384
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,750
She wouldn't talk to them.
She told me.

385
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,458
Did you tell the police?
Or David?

386
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,041
Confessing a plan
to murder someone

387
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,166
isn't protected by
doctor-patient confidentiality.

388
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,709
And if a therapist hears it,

389
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,500
she can be held liable
if she doesn't report it.

390
00:18:56,542 --> 00:18:58,500
There's a difference between
a threat and a plan.

391
00:18:58,542 --> 00:19:01,041
Joanna didn't tell the police
so she could kill him.

392
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,667
Come on, Charlotte.

393
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:04,542
She just heard
her husband killed her baby,

394
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,041
a baby he never wanted,

395
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,917
and tried to force her
to have a hysterectomy.

396
00:19:07,959 --> 00:19:10,041
She is allowed to have
an emotional response.

397
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,041
And she needs to feel the safety

398
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,041
to express that anger
to a therapist.

399
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,709
And now you have a legal
obligation to deal with it.

400
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,500
Wait a minute. Violet's
not technically her therapist.

401
00:19:18,542 --> 00:19:19,500
Your license was suspended

402
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:21,083
most of the time
you were talking to her.

403
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:24,041
She's not a formal patient.
I mean, there's no file--

404
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,750
Pete is right.
We're just friends.

405
00:19:25,792 --> 00:19:27,709
Friends do not have
a legal obligation, right?

406
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,625
No, Violet,
you can't have it both ways.

407
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:31,083
You do have your license
back now.

408
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,542
The moment you heard the threat,
you were a therapist.

409
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:36,041
Not hers.
Would a court see it that way?

410
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,709
I won't second-guess Violet

411
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,208
and say this guy
isn't a dirtbag criminal,

412
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,041
but if David's life
is really threatened,

413
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,291
we have
a moral obligation here.

414
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,542
Where is he, anyway?
I sent him home last night

415
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,041
before she regained
consciousness.

416
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,083
Say Violet does warn David,

417
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,083
and then he retaliates
against Joanna. What then?

418
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:54,959
Look, Violet, I'm on your side,
but how do we protect everyone?

419
00:19:58,667 --> 00:20:02,000
You have to go into this
with an open mind.

420
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,041
She's not right.

421
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,041
You haven't even met her yet.

422
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:10,625
I can feel the warmth
from her every pore.

423
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,125
It's nauseating me
all the way over here.

424
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,583
Have you secretly been giving
yourself hormone shots again?

425
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:17,041
Look, I'm gonna go in there,
I'm gonna ask June

426
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,959
what the best part
about being a surrogate is,

427
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,041
and she's gonna give me
some weird, hippy-dippy answer

428
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,458
about the magic of motherhood.

429
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,709
You have no idea
what she's gonna say.

430
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,041
Okay, fine. Let's go.

431
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:35,500
So, June, what was the best part
of your last experience?

432
00:20:35,542 --> 00:20:39,041
That's easy. The parents let me
keep the placenta,

433
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:44,667
and they came to my house to
help me Bury it in the garden.

434
00:20:46,667 --> 00:20:48,417
And we planted a tree there.

435
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:50,834
Hmm.

436
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,667
Okay, so what about church?

437
00:20:53,709 --> 00:20:57,041
Hmm. No, that's
too much commitment for me.

438
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,041
I know,
but the whole point

439
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,375
is to meet women
who want commitment.

440
00:21:00,417 --> 00:21:02,041
If only there was
some computer-based system

441
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:05,333
where eligible people from
all over the land could connect.

442
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:07,709
Online dating is the number one
way to meet women.

443
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,208
We're looking for women of more
depth than those cyber-honeys

444
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,667
you used to meet
on those sites.

445
00:21:11,709 --> 00:21:14,250
Heh, I met my wife
on one of those sites.

446
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,875
Yeah, but, I mean,
you knew her in real life.

447
00:21:16,917 --> 00:21:18,458
And hated her and she hated me.

448
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,834
But by going online

449
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,750
and stripping away
all the preconceived notions,

450
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:24,542
we were able to find out we were
actually very compatible.

451
00:21:26,542 --> 00:21:28,834
Portable X-ray to the er.

452
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:31,458
Portable X-ray to the er.

453
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,166
Where's my wife?
I released her.

454
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,375
I told you I wanted to take her
to another hospital.

455
00:21:40,417 --> 00:21:42,041
It was Joanna's request
to leave.

456
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,542
I never got a chance
to talk to her.

457
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:45,083
Not my problem.

458
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:48,834
This is not over.

459
00:21:51,542 --> 00:21:54,041
Yes, it is.
Now back the hell away from me

460
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:56,959
before I have your ass
dragged out of my hospital.

461
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:09,083
Your solution
was to bring Joanna home?

462
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:11,041
All she'd do
in the hospital is recover,

463
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:12,500
and I can take
better care of her here.

464
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,625
Yeah.
Better than the nursing staff?

465
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,417
What if there's a complication
or emergency?

466
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:19,959
I'll call the ambulance. There's
not gonna be an emergency.

467
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,166
And I can change a bandage.
I am a doctor, Pete.

468
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:26,500
I just...

469
00:22:26,542 --> 00:22:29,083
I need you to take Lucas
for a few days.

470
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:32,083
There are shelters where she'd
be safe. And you would be too.

471
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:33,083
A shelter is not ideal

472
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:34,750
for somebody
recovering from surgery.

473
00:22:34,792 --> 00:22:37,041
And this way I'll be able
to talk to her. Really talk.

474
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:39,250
You know, find out
if the threat is real.

475
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,875
She's protected because
he doesn't know where she is.

476
00:22:41,917 --> 00:22:44,250
He's protected because
I'm not leaving her side.

477
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:46,000
I'm protected
because both of them are.

478
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:49,458
I don't like you
putting yourself in the middle.

479
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,667
Well, there's a lot of decisions
I make that you might not like,

480
00:22:53,709 --> 00:22:55,667
but you don't really get a say
in them anymore.

481
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:58,208
But what you do get a say in

482
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:01,125
is whether Lucas
is in the middle of it too.

483
00:23:03,834 --> 00:23:05,542
Okay.
You give my truck.

484
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:08,041
- You wanna hold it, baby?
- Daddy's gonna take you, okay?

485
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:10,583
Okay, pal. Are you ready?

486
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:12,041
Up.
Do you want the truck?

487
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:14,041
- Yeah. Here.
- My truck?

488
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:18,083
Here it is. I love you.
Be good.

489
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:20,000
- Bye-bye.
- Here we go.

490
00:23:22,542 --> 00:23:23,917
Hey, Pete?

491
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,458
If you were me,
what would you have done?

492
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:31,041
The same thing.

493
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:33,000
Thank you.

494
00:23:36,709 --> 00:23:38,250
Bye-bye.

495
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:53,000
Hey, how's it going?
Fine.

496
00:23:57,583 --> 00:23:58,834
Are you mad at me?

497
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:00,625
Mad? No.

498
00:24:00,667 --> 00:24:02,625
I'm not trying to be a pain
about the surrogate stuff.

499
00:24:02,667 --> 00:24:05,041
You don't have
to apologize, all right?

500
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:06,250
But let's stop wasting time,

501
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:08,458
because your heart's
definitely not into this.

502
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:12,250
You'll find a flaw with anyone
who wants to do this for you.

503
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:14,041
That is not true.
It is.

504
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:16,500
And there's nothing wrong
with these surrogates.

505
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:18,458
They're all fine.
So what? I'm the problem?

506
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,291
You said it, not me.

507
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:26,291
Hey.

508
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:30,875
Um, I need to ask you
a question,

509
00:24:30,917 --> 00:24:32,583
and I want you to give me
an honest answer.

510
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:35,625
Um, whatever you say,
I won't tell Cooper.

511
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:39,583
Okay.
Um...

512
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:43,542
They give you these pamphlets
on the side effects of chemo.

513
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:47,875
You know, the hair loss,
nausea, vomiting, bleeding.

514
00:24:47,917 --> 00:24:52,000
Not specific, bleeding
from where. I've read them all.

515
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:54,500
What I wanna ask is, um,

516
00:24:56,083 --> 00:24:57,792
if you were in my shoes,

517
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:02,375
would you put yourself
through this?

518
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:03,750
Destroying
your quality of life

519
00:25:03,792 --> 00:25:08,041
for the chance at maybe
a few more painful months?

520
00:25:08,083 --> 00:25:11,083
Or would you spend
every possible healthy moment

521
00:25:11,125 --> 00:25:14,083
with the most important person
in your life?

522
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:29,000
I wouldn't.

523
00:25:31,083 --> 00:25:32,375
I wouldn't do the treatment.

524
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,792
Yeah.

525
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:59,250
No, no, no. Sam,
you can't put hair color: Bald.

526
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,583
Why not?
I shave my head.

527
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:03,458
No, no, no. You put
what color your hair would be

528
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,667
if it grew out, you know?

529
00:26:04,709 --> 00:26:06,458
And... what?

530
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,625
You put you're a grandpa on
the first line about yourself?

531
00:26:09,667 --> 00:26:10,875
Heh.
What, are you crazy?

532
00:26:10,917 --> 00:26:12,875
Well, I'm proud
to be a grandpa.

533
00:26:12,917 --> 00:26:14,166
No, listen,
you can be forthcoming,

534
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:16,083
but you can still be delicate
with the truth.

535
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:20,625
So bald is well-groomed and
grandpa is just a family man.

536
00:26:20,667 --> 00:26:22,166
Okay, the section
on physical attributes

537
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:23,667
is depressing
in present company,

538
00:26:23,709 --> 00:26:27,792
so I'm just gonna move on
to questions of substance.

539
00:26:27,834 --> 00:26:29,667
"What is your biggest flaw?"

540
00:26:29,709 --> 00:26:32,041
Too sensitive.

541
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:34,208
That's gold.
Yeah, well, maybe for you.

542
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,834
Your answer, prince charming?

543
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:37,208
Too passionate about my work.

544
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:40,208
Hmm. That's good.
Okay, yeah. No, you're good.

545
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:43,041
I see my sage advice
is being heeded.

546
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:46,208
Okay, Mr. Sage, what would be
Sam's ideal first date?

547
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:49,083
Well... excuse me.
Sure.

548
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:53,834
I used to start with, uh, this.

549
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:54,834
- Yeah.
- Ugh.

550
00:26:54,875 --> 00:26:57,125
No, no, no.
That's...

551
00:26:57,166 --> 00:27:00,041
Cooper, this is
a family practice. Please.

552
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:01,417
Whatever it is,
I need to see it.

553
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:03,834
They're writing
their online dating profiles.

554
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,875
What's wrong with that?

555
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:10,709
Nothing. But why is Sam
bothering to write anything?

556
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:13,083
He should just post
a shirtless picture of himself

557
00:27:13,125 --> 00:27:14,500
with "Dr. Bennett" above it.

558
00:27:14,542 --> 00:27:16,709
He'll have a thousand dates
in an hour.

559
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,291
And Sheldon,

560
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:20,750
it's not like he needs the rest
of you yahoos to tell him

561
00:27:20,792 --> 00:27:22,583
what a girl wants to hear.

562
00:27:27,417 --> 00:27:30,208
Well, maybe loved and lost
is better, man.

563
00:27:44,834 --> 00:27:46,083
I'm sorry.

564
00:27:46,125 --> 00:27:49,291
The last thing you need
is to be taking care of me.

565
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:50,291
It's fine.

566
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:52,417
You have Lucas to worry about.

567
00:27:52,458 --> 00:27:54,208
- Plus Pete.
- Lucas is doing fine.

568
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:58,709
And Pete and I, you know,
we're working through it.

569
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:02,375
It's a lot better.
There's less anger.

570
00:28:02,417 --> 00:28:04,417
So you don't have
to worry about it.

571
00:28:04,458 --> 00:28:06,333
Pull your shirt up.

572
00:28:10,834 --> 00:28:14,875
I read your book.
It made me feel like a failure.

573
00:28:14,917 --> 00:28:15,959
Why?

574
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,583
You went through
this terrible thing,

575
00:28:18,625 --> 00:28:21,166
and you overcame it. But I...

576
00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:25,500
I knew in my heart.

577
00:28:26,917 --> 00:28:29,458
I mean, hit me once,
shame on you, hit me twice...

578
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,667
But I went back to David anyway.

579
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:33,000
Well...

580
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:37,542
That was a mistake,
and you can correct it.

581
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:39,125
By going to the police?

582
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:43,041
I've seen those women
on the stand, in court.

583
00:28:43,083 --> 00:28:45,000
The victims.

584
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:48,000
I'm not a victim.

585
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:50,792
Being a victim
does not mean you're powerless.

586
00:28:50,834 --> 00:28:53,041
But I chose to be with him.

587
00:28:53,083 --> 00:28:56,458
I let him back in.
It's my fault.

588
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,583
You don't understand that,

589
00:28:58,625 --> 00:29:00,500
because what happened to you
wasn't your fault.

590
00:29:00,542 --> 00:29:03,917
It felt like it was.
It always does.

591
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:08,041
I have great faith
in people's capacity to change.

592
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:11,625
My patients. My husband.

593
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:17,041
And when they don't, I assume
that I did something wrong.

594
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:20,875
And sometimes I did.
But a lot of times I didn't.

595
00:29:20,917 --> 00:29:24,667
But I can't tell the difference
in my own life. No one can.

596
00:29:24,709 --> 00:29:29,125
It's understandable that
you would think he could change.

597
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:37,959
Joanna, we need to talk about
what you said.

598
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,458
About David.

599
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:43,041
Oh, Violet, no. No, please.

600
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:44,458
I, unh...

601
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:49,041
You really think I'm gonna
kill David? I was just upset.

602
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:52,458
I was frustrated and hurting.

603
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,041
You can understand that,
can't you?

604
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:55,083
Yes, yes, yes.

605
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:57,583
Of course I can.
But I also know that,

606
00:29:57,625 --> 00:30:00,000
you know, if a person
is pushed past

607
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:03,750
any reasonable limit, you--

608
00:30:03,792 --> 00:30:06,333
oh, Joanna.

609
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,709
I can't believe that you would
think that I would do that.

610
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:15,083
I mean, no matter what happened.
I just...

611
00:30:16,417 --> 00:30:19,291
I just wanna be somewhere
where I feel safe

612
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:20,709
and I don't have to be scared,

613
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,917
and I can start putting my life
back together again.

614
00:30:26,083 --> 00:30:27,291
You are.

615
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:44,500
How's the rent-a-womb search
going?

616
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:46,750
They're all wrong.

617
00:30:46,792 --> 00:30:49,542
And Jake thinks I'm being
unfair and judgmental,

618
00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:50,834
but it is a huge decision.

619
00:30:50,875 --> 00:30:52,500
You know?

620
00:30:52,542 --> 00:30:55,625
Finding someone
to carry my baby.

621
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:58,375
The first one was like
a breeding machine.

622
00:30:58,417 --> 00:31:01,041
The second one looked like
she just wandered off a commune.

623
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:04,000
I don't know.

624
00:31:04,041 --> 00:31:05,667
I could do it.
What?

625
00:31:05,709 --> 00:31:09,208
I'm the closest thing you have
to a sister.

626
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:10,750
And I can do this.

627
00:31:10,792 --> 00:31:13,041
Amelia.

628
00:31:13,083 --> 00:31:17,041
I know. I'm the anti-surrogate.

629
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,750
I'm an addict and I wouldn't
pass the psych eval,

630
00:31:19,792 --> 00:31:24,041
and it's semi-creepy
that I'm your ex-sister-in-law.

631
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:26,792
It would be a monumental failure
of your brilliant mind

632
00:31:26,834 --> 00:31:28,041
to pick me.

633
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:29,834
But I wanna do it.

634
00:31:31,291 --> 00:31:34,667
I wanna do this one
completely selfless thing.

635
00:31:34,709 --> 00:31:37,875
There are people
that we can't help.

636
00:31:37,917 --> 00:31:39,083
There are inoperable
brain tumors

637
00:31:39,125 --> 00:31:42,208
and kids who face
too much tragedy and...

638
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,500
And Ryan.

639
00:31:46,083 --> 00:31:47,458
Bringing a life
into this world,

640
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:51,208
it could be the thing
that I can do to make up for--

641
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:55,667
I can help you.
I wanna help you.

642
00:31:55,709 --> 00:31:59,458
Let me, Addie. Please.

643
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:04,041
I love you, Amelia,

644
00:32:04,083 --> 00:32:06,709
and I'm honored
that you've offered this,

645
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:10,041
but the most important thing
that you can do

646
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:14,041
now that you're sober,
is to figure out who you are.

647
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:18,083
And who you are,
can't be my surrogate.

648
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:33,250
Hi. Declaration of paternity.

649
00:32:33,291 --> 00:32:35,709
Application to amend
the birth certificate.

650
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,750
We can go to your lawyer
tomorrow to sign these.

651
00:32:37,792 --> 00:32:40,875
That should cover
your custody concerns.

652
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,000
This is acceptance.

653
00:32:43,583 --> 00:32:46,041
You won't try the treatment?
Even for Mason?

654
00:32:46,083 --> 00:32:48,125
Everything I do is for Mason.

655
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:49,667
Every single thing

656
00:32:49,709 --> 00:32:51,583
since the moment
I found out I was pregnant.

657
00:32:51,625 --> 00:32:52,792
I brought him here to meet you,

658
00:32:52,834 --> 00:32:55,041
which I wasn't gonna do
in a million years.

659
00:32:55,083 --> 00:32:57,500
I did it for him.

660
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:59,291
I'm changing
the birth certificate for him.

661
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:02,458
Erica. You have to fight.
I can't win.

662
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,250
I don't wanna fight if
there's not a chance I can win.

663
00:33:05,291 --> 00:33:07,041
There is.
There's always a chance.

664
00:33:07,083 --> 00:33:08,959
Even if at first
it just means buying time--

665
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,250
Cooper, please, stop it.

666
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:15,625
Now you need
to accept it. Okay?

667
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,500
He says he wants to see
the Grand Canyon.

668
00:33:25,542 --> 00:33:27,125
For his next birthday.

669
00:33:29,125 --> 00:33:30,792
Just so you know.

670
00:33:44,083 --> 00:33:46,000
Hey, hey.

671
00:33:49,709 --> 00:33:51,166
Now you're spoiling me.

672
00:33:51,208 --> 00:33:53,041
Please, you haven't
tasted the eggs yet.

673
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:54,125
You need anything else?

674
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:56,250
For you to get back
to your life.

675
00:33:56,291 --> 00:33:58,792
I'm fine.
I'm gonna get the paper.

676
00:33:58,834 --> 00:34:03,041
And, uh, you can eat,
then we'll, uh, plan the day.

677
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:05,959
Maybe we'll get you up
for, uh, a walk later.

678
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,041
Where is she?
I wanna talk to my wife.

679
00:34:08,083 --> 00:34:10,458
She's not here.
I love you so much. I'm sorry.

680
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,041
I don't want to see you,
David!

681
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:14,333
- Get out of my house.
- I just wanna talk to her.

682
00:34:14,375 --> 00:34:17,041
I'm not leaving without my wife.
No, I'm leaving you, David.

683
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:19,208
Please, don't say that.
You are a bastard

684
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:22,250
and a bully and a coward.
I don't love you.

685
00:34:22,291 --> 00:34:24,208
I could never love you again.

686
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:28,041
Shut up! Stop saying that.
This is your fault.

687
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:31,083
- Just leave.
- Leave her alone! Go!

688
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:33,875
You killed my baby! I'd never
love someone who did that!

689
00:34:33,917 --> 00:34:35,792
- Shut up!
- Shut up and go!

690
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:43,667
I hate you. I hate you.

691
00:34:43,709 --> 00:34:46,500
You bastard.
You killed my baby.

692
00:34:47,834 --> 00:34:51,291
I hate you. I hate you.

693
00:34:51,333 --> 00:34:55,083
I hate you. I hate you.
I hate you.

694
00:34:55,125 --> 00:34:57,500
- I hate you.
- Oh, my god.

695
00:34:57,542 --> 00:35:01,625
- I hate you.
- Joanna. Joanna. Joanna.

696
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:06,041
I hate you.
He's dead! You have to stop!

697
00:35:06,083 --> 00:35:09,000
Stop. Stop.

698
00:35:11,083 --> 00:35:12,500
Stop.

699
00:35:22,709 --> 00:35:26,000
I had to. I had to.
He didn't give me a choice.

700
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:33,041
I had to protect myself.
And you. I had to.

701
00:35:37,834 --> 00:35:40,625
You'll tell the police that,
right?

702
00:35:43,083 --> 00:35:45,959
I had to.

703
00:35:54,041 --> 00:35:55,500
Hey.

704
00:35:55,542 --> 00:35:57,083
Hey.

705
00:35:58,291 --> 00:36:02,667
So I was, uh, surprised
that you called.

706
00:36:02,709 --> 00:36:05,083
Thank you for coming.

707
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:07,500
Look, have a seat.

708
00:36:11,667 --> 00:36:13,959
I just wanna tell you,
you were right.

709
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,125
About what?

710
00:36:15,166 --> 00:36:17,083
There is something wrong
with me.

711
00:36:17,125 --> 00:36:18,208
Oh, no, Addison,

712
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,709
I didn't mean
to make you feel like--

713
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:22,041
no, it's not your fault.
It's just, um...

714
00:36:22,083 --> 00:36:26,375
I just need a break.
From all of it.

715
00:36:27,959 --> 00:36:29,041
You're giving up?

716
00:36:29,083 --> 00:36:31,500
No. I want a baby.
I will have a baby.

717
00:36:31,542 --> 00:36:33,500
I just...

718
00:36:33,542 --> 00:36:38,959
Right now, I just need
to be for a while.

719
00:36:40,083 --> 00:36:44,792
I need to focus on something
else, on anything else.

720
00:36:46,709 --> 00:36:51,000
Yeah. Yeah,
I think that's smart.

721
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:59,291
So you, uh, want some company?

722
00:37:00,709 --> 00:37:03,709
Yeah, I do.

723
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:16,458
I understand. I--

724
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:20,041
I go to the station,
I could call a lawyer.

725
00:37:20,083 --> 00:37:24,041
So when you woke up,
he was already dead?

726
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:32,041
Dr. Turner?
He was already dead.

727
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:35,041
So you didn't see
what actually happened

728
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:36,333
before she stabbed him?

729
00:37:38,917 --> 00:37:41,250
Well, it was self-defense.

730
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:46,917
He broke into my home.

731
00:37:46,959 --> 00:37:50,625
He attacked both of us.
It was self-defense.

732
00:37:50,667 --> 00:37:55,542
Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Violet.

733
00:37:58,083 --> 00:37:59,500
Are you all right?
Are you all right?

734
00:37:59,542 --> 00:38:01,041
Let me see.
Yeah. I'm okay.

735
00:38:01,083 --> 00:38:03,041
I just gotta move out
of this place, but yeah.

736
00:38:03,083 --> 00:38:06,542
What can I do?
What do you need?

737
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:10,417
Uh, can you just
keep taking care of Lucas?

738
00:38:10,458 --> 00:38:11,458
I'm just gonna clean up.

739
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,875
Of course. Of course.
Thank you.

740
00:38:29,083 --> 00:38:31,166
I tried to make her go
to treatment.

741
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:32,333
I know you did.

742
00:38:32,375 --> 00:38:36,458
I really tried.
I know.

743
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,000
No. It was...

744
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,458
If Erica wasn't sick,
I never would have met Mason.

745
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,041
So you keep saying.

746
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:49,000
No, Charlotte.

747
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:57,166
If Erica wasn't sick,
I never would have met Mason.

748
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,166
And you feel guilty

749
00:39:00,208 --> 00:39:03,458
because of how grateful you are
that this happened?

750
00:39:07,542 --> 00:39:09,333
Hey.

751
00:39:27,083 --> 00:39:28,959
Can I come in?

752
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,792
Yeah. What happened?
Did somebody hit you?

753
00:39:31,834 --> 00:39:34,000
I don't wanna talk about it.

754
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:39,583
Okay. All right. Let's, uh,
sit down. Let me take a look.

755
00:39:49,166 --> 00:39:51,000
Head's up.

756
00:39:57,083 --> 00:39:59,917
It's not broken but, man...

757
00:40:01,208 --> 00:40:04,500
Lie down.
Let me get you some ice.

758
00:40:04,542 --> 00:40:05,750
Here.

759
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:23,375
Hey. I'm here for you.

760
00:40:23,417 --> 00:40:28,083
Whatever it is,
whatever you need, I'm here.

761
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:47,333
Addison.
Yeah?

762
00:40:47,375 --> 00:40:50,000
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

763
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:53,041
Uh, heh...

764
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:55,542
What do you think
my biggest flaw is?

765
00:40:55,583 --> 00:40:57,333
What?

766
00:40:57,375 --> 00:41:00,542
It was just something
I'm thinking about.

767
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,542
Other than the fact that
you don't wanna have a baby?

768
00:41:02,583 --> 00:41:05,041
Uh-huh.
Um...

769
00:41:05,083 --> 00:41:08,041
Well, let's see.

770
00:41:08,083 --> 00:41:11,125
You know, you don't recognize
how great you truly are.

771
00:41:11,166 --> 00:41:13,375
I'm serious.
You're kind of the perfect man,

772
00:41:13,417 --> 00:41:15,709
but you just
judge yourself so harshly

773
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:18,458
and kind of hold yourself to
this impossibly high standard.

774
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:22,750
You gotta learn how
to just relax a little.

775
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,375
And for the record,
that is not your only flaw.

776
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:28,667
It's just your biggest.

777
00:41:38,542 --> 00:41:40,208
Addie.
Yes.

778
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:44,375
I took a chance
and guessed you were

779
00:41:44,417 --> 00:41:46,542
a "beer out of a bottle"
kind of girl.

780
00:41:46,583 --> 00:41:48,583
Sam, what were you gonna ask me?

781
00:41:48,625 --> 00:41:51,291
Uh... hey, man.

782
00:41:51,333 --> 00:41:52,583
Sam, you want a beer?

783
00:41:52,625 --> 00:41:55,542
No, no. I am good.

784
00:41:55,583 --> 00:41:57,000
I'll see you guys later.

785
00:41:57,041 --> 00:41:58,333
See you.
Yeah.

786
00:42:09,333 --> 00:42:12,041
Sometimes when we were stuck,
we'd stop for a minute to rest,

787
00:42:12,083 --> 00:42:14,041
regain our strength.

788
00:42:14,083 --> 00:42:18,458
You know, let the waves
take us for a while.

789
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:23,834
Even if we weren't going
anywhere, it was still sailing.
