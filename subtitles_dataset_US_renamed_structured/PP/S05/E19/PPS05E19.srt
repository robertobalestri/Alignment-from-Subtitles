♪ Ohhh ohhh ohhh ♪

2
00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:10,709
I'll never forget
the first time

3
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:14,083
in introduced myself
as Dr. Addison Montgomery.

4
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:17,041
I was a resident in New York,
and I got paged to the E.R.

5
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:19,041
I was prepared for anything--

6
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:21,792
emergency c-section,
breech baby, ectopic pregnancy--

7
00:00:21,834 --> 00:00:24,333
but it was just
a routine delivery.

8
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:26,208
Woman's third kid.

9
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,625
She pushed, she screamed,
she held her daughter.

10
00:00:28,667 --> 00:00:32,041
But... something changed in me

11
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:36,458
when I heard that woman
call me "Dr. Montgomery."

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,959
I felt like a superhero

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,208
who had taken on
another identity.

14
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,166
Honestly, I never thought
I'd feel that way again...

15
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:46,250
Until today.

16
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:48,667
I was sitting on the beach
in front of the house,

17
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:50,834
and this little girl
named June

18
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:54,667
came over to see
what was inside the basket.

19
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:57,041
I told her

20
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:59,041
his name was Henry.

21
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:01,500
And then she asked
who I was.

22
00:01:01,542 --> 00:01:05,333
And I said,
"I am Henry's mom."

23
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:15,458
Are you ready?

24
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,875
I guess so.

25
00:01:16,917 --> 00:01:18,041
Okay. Just relax.

26
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:20,041
We're gonna see something
in a second.

27
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:22,875
Do you wanna know
if it's a boy or a girl?

28
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:24,250
I need to know everything.

29
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:26,000
Okay.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,417
Oh, my god.

31
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:38,083
There it is.

32
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:40,208
There...

33
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,834
He is.

34
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:45,125
Oh.

35
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:48,583
Oh, he's beautiful.

36
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:53,458
Addison?

37
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:56,625
Addison?

38
00:01:56,667 --> 00:01:58,750
Addison.

39
00:01:58,792 --> 00:02:01,000
Addison?!

40
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,709
Your migraines are the result
of vascular spasm.

41
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,667
You should get some relief
with the sumatriptan.

42
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:11,291
So there's no way
it's a tumor?

43
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:12,792
You're sure?

44
00:02:12,834 --> 00:02:14,041
I'm sure.

45
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:16,500
Oh, thank you.

46
00:02:16,542 --> 00:02:18,709
And I'm sorry for being
so self-involved.

47
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,792
When are you due?

48
00:02:21,834 --> 00:02:23,458
A few months.

49
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,125
Oh, it must be
so exciting.

50
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:29,125
I can't wait
to have one of my own.

51
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:30,583
You're carrying high.

52
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,041
I think that means
you're having a boy.

53
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:33,250
Do you know?

54
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,500
I have another patient.

55
00:02:34,542 --> 00:02:36,625
Oh, sure. Good luck.

56
00:02:36,667 --> 00:02:37,834
You doin' all right?

57
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,083
I'm great.

58
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:47,000
Hello, Mr. Henry.

59
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,333
I have an appointment
with Cooper.

60
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,709
Give me that baby.

61
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:59,208
Hello.

62
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,166
I've gotta admit,
that little rug rat's

63
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:02,583
pretty cute.
Right?

64
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:05,041
I swear, it is impossible
to feel bad about anything

65
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:06,208
when I'm around him.

66
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,166
I just wish I could
share it with Amelia, but--

67
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:10,125
hey. Welcome back, Addison.

68
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,750
Thank you.
I-I'm not "back" back.

69
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,041
I'm just visiting.

70
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,667
Hey, there's the little man.

71
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:16,041
You, uh, you mind
if I hold him?

72
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,750
Sure. Oh, oh, oh, oh.

73
00:03:17,792 --> 00:03:19,125
Did you, uh,
get the basket I sent?

74
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,834
Yes, thank you.

75
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,583
I would've come over sooner,
but, you know,

76
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,458
- we doctors are carriers of all sorts of viruses, right?
- Oh, no

77
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,041
- of course.
- Come here, you.

78
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:28,041
Uh, is this...
Breast milk.

79
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,458
Okay. From?

80
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,875
From the milk bank, Sam.

81
00:03:30,917 --> 00:03:32,250
It's not like I was
trolling the streets

82
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:34,041
looking for lactating--

83
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,875
just--
just don't touch it, okay?

84
00:03:35,917 --> 00:03:37,375
Okay.
Don't worry about it.

85
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:39,750
So Amelia fired me as her o.B.,
and she's not speaking to me.

86
00:03:39,792 --> 00:03:41,000
Is she talking to anybody?

87
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,375
You know what?
We've all tried.

88
00:03:42,417 --> 00:03:44,083
But I think she needs
her space right now.

89
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,083
When she's ready,
she'll reach out.

90
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,291
Now I have to go back to work.

91
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:52,709
But you come see auntie vi
before you go, okay?

92
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,667
Is she getting
any prenatal care?

93
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:56,041
You know, I tried
to bring that up,

94
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,667
but she basically told me
to back off.

95
00:03:57,709 --> 00:03:59,500
I don't want
to sound insensitive,

96
00:03:59,542 --> 00:04:01,041
but are there any signs
that she's using again?

97
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,875
Mnh-mnh. I've been watching.
She seems clean.

98
00:04:02,917 --> 00:04:04,041
Yeah, she's living
in my home.

99
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,208
I think I would know
if she were.

100
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,625
Well, it's too bad
Sheldon's not around.

101
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:07,834
Maybe she'd talk to him.

102
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,041
Has anybody heard
from Sheldon?

103
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,041
Oh, we got a postcard
from him. He's in Aruba.

104
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,208
Aruba?
Aruba?

105
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,709
What's he doing there?

106
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,333
Apparently his
ex-wife left a guy at the altar,

107
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,041
but the honeymoon
was paid for.

108
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,041
So he is her plus one.

109
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,208
Oh.

110
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,041
It's nice to have
a plus one.

111
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,458
So, uh, Mason...

112
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,041
Wet our bed this morning.

113
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,959
Please no lectures.

114
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,083
I'm not ready to force him
to sleep in his own room yet.

115
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:35,041
When do you think
you will be?

116
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,542
I don't know,
but he won't even speak.

117
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:38,041
So the idea of exiling him
to his own room--

118
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:40,041
well, don't think of it
as exiling.

119
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,041
Think of it as not
giving him special treatment

120
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,041
for unwanted behavior.

121
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,542
It's like I said

122
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,041
when he first
stopped speaking,

123
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,333
y-you can't force him
to talk,

124
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,000
but he has to ask
for what he wants.

125
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,375
You know, treat him with
respect. Don't indulge him.

126
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:51,709
He may be a kid,

127
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,041
but he's a very smart kid.

128
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,041
Well, it feels like
he's not a kid anymore.

129
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,041
It feels like the moment
his mother died,

130
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,041
his childhood was over.
It was done.

131
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,959
He cries in his sleep
every night.

132
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,583
My son is in a kind of pain
that I've never experienced,

133
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,041
and there's nothing
I can do about it.

134
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:08,041
Well, you're in mourning,
too, Cooper--

135
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:11,041
for Erica, for the loss
of Mason's innocence,

136
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:13,583
for the toll that it's
taken on you and Charlotte.

137
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,166
Just...

138
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,166
Don't let
Mason's regression deepen,

139
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,250
because once kids start
disappearing into themselves...

140
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:23,041
Okay.
I won't push him on speaking.

141
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,959
And I will...

142
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,417
Dehydrate him every night
before he goes to sleep?

143
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,041
You're gonna get
those waterproof mattress covers

144
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,291
and you're gonna put it
on the bed.

145
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,709
And you're gonna put him
in that bed,

146
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,792
wearing those pajamas
that ring a little alarm

147
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,041
when the kid pees
to wake him up.

148
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:38,834
And then he'll start
speaking again?

149
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,500
Hang in there, Coop.

150
00:05:40,542 --> 00:05:43,041
It's gonna get better.

151
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,041
Look at those fingers.

152
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,917
Oh.

153
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,041
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

154
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,083
Hey, yourself.

155
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,291
I was--i was gonna head down
to the promenade

156
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,500
and grab a coffee.

157
00:05:51,542 --> 00:05:53,709
You wanna--you wanna
take Henry for a-a walk?

158
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,333
Oh, no, thanks. No.

159
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:59,041
We are just perfect

160
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,208
right where we are.

161
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,875
Huh?

162
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:04,625
See you later.
Oh.

163
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:06,625
All right, man.
Hi, little boy.

164
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:08,667
What first attracted you
to each other?

165
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:10,125
I--
oh, that's a great question.

166
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,875
Yeah, if we discuss what
first drew us to each other,

167
00:06:12,917 --> 00:06:14,875
that'll reinforce
our connection.

168
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:18,041
Violet, you--you are
obviously a very...

169
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,583
Talented therapist.

170
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,458
But in this room,
you're a patient.

171
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,875
You're right.
Right. You're right.

172
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:26,583
I'm--I'm sorry.

173
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,583
So...

174
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:29,917
Pete?

175
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:31,709
Well...

176
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,041
Violet is a fighter.

177
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,291
The way she fights
for her patients,

178
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,709
how passionate she is,

179
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,291
it was--it was hot.

180
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,709
It was hot?

181
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,583
No, I mean, it still is.

182
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,000
It--but...

183
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:44,166
We had a lot of fun

184
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:45,500
at the beginning.

185
00:06:45,542 --> 00:06:47,291
We did.

186
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,500
And now?

187
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,041
Uh...

188
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,041
We're here to...

189
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,458
Put our family back together,

190
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,542
to--to get our relationship
back to the way it was

191
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:03,959
at the beginning.

192
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,250
I mean, we're aware that
we can't go back, but...

193
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:08,875
Pete.

194
00:07:08,917 --> 00:07:10,041
Yeah.

195
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,500
You look upset.

196
00:07:11,542 --> 00:07:12,917
I'm not upset.

197
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:15,083
When Violet...
Corrected you just now,

198
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:17,041
you looked upset.

199
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,834
I-I didn't correct him,
did I?

200
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,208
Did I correct you?

201
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,041
I didn't notice.

202
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:24,750
You know, for two people
considering divorce,

203
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:27,875
this has been
a-an awfully polite session.

204
00:07:27,917 --> 00:07:29,500
Yeah, we're not
considering divorce

205
00:07:29,542 --> 00:07:32,208
so much as we're
considering reconciliation.

206
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,917
A-And since when is
being polite a bad thing?

207
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,041
Well,
we tried Dr. Perkins,

208
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,792
but you said
he was too intense.

209
00:07:40,834 --> 00:07:42,166
Then we went with your choice,
who wasn't even really a doctor.

210
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,583
Osteopathic medicine
is real medicine.

211
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,000
He was a real psychiatrist,
Violet.

212
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,041
We agreed
on whitehouse.

213
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,375
Can we please
just give him a shot?

214
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:48,792
Dr. Wilder!

215
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:50,000
What do you got?

216
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:51,041
Drea Spencer,
9-year-old female

217
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,375
found with
multiple stab wounds.

218
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:53,709
She's hypotensive.

219
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,917
Okay, let's get her
into bay one.

220
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,041
Crossmatch her times four.

221
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,333
Trauma panel--
chest and abdomen.

222
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:58,917
That's my sister!
You have to save her!

223
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:00,166
What's your name, sweetie?
Missy.

224
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,333
Missy, you should not
be in here.

225
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:02,959
No, no, no, I need
to see my sister.

226
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,500
All right, I got a page
about a stab victim.

227
00:08:04,542 --> 00:08:06,083
Yeah, we gotta get a handle
on this bleeding.

228
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,917
All right, I'll get
the central line started.

229
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,750
I told her I just needed
an extra half-hour

230
00:08:09,792 --> 00:08:11,125
to finish my algebra and then
we were gonna make cupcakes,

231
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,750
but when I went in to get her,
she wasn't in her room.

232
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:16,041
And I kept yelling her name
and looking for her.

233
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,417
And then I-I heard the sirens

234
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,417
and--and then the cars came
and stopped at the house.

235
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,041
Missy,
we should wait outside.

236
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,959
I didn't know she left
the house!

237
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,333
We lost her pulse.
Help her, please!

238
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:25,542
I need a thoracotomy tray.

239
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,041
Oh! Oh, my baby.

240
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,959
Oh, my god.
What happened?

241
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,291
Your daughter is suffering
from multiple stab wounds,

242
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,917
including one to the heart.

243
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:33,500
We need to get her to surgery
to repair it right now.

244
00:08:33,542 --> 00:08:35,917
We need to stem the blood flow.
She's about to bleed out.

245
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:37,041
Okay, just do
what you have to do.

246
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,083
Please, you gotta help her.

247
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,291
Violet.
Please.

248
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,917
Everybody out. Now.
It's okay. All right.

249
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,041
Let's go.

250
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,875
Missy.

251
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,583
Missy.

252
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:51,792
Come on. It's okay.
It's okay.

253
00:08:56,709 --> 00:08:58,041
Hey, um...

254
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:01,125
I actually think we don't
have time for this now so i--

255
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,458
mm.

256
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,875
Okay, maybe we do.

257
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,041
What did Violet say
about Mason and the peeing?

258
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,125
Your pillow talk
needs a little help.

259
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,125
I'm serious.
I wanna be...

260
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,291
Helpful, and if being in bed
with us is comforting,

261
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,917
I am all for it,

262
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:19,583
but I just don't want
to do the wrong thing.

263
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,583
She said that Mason needs
a little more tough love.

264
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,917
Mm. So what do we do?

265
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,917
Uh, we don't do anything.
Not yet.

266
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,917
Wait. What do you mean?

267
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,291
I mean, Violet's not wrong,
but I know Mason.

268
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:31,667
What he needs is time
and comfort.

269
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:33,041
He doesn't need
another challenge right now.

270
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,625
Is that really what
he needs

271
00:09:34,667 --> 00:09:37,166
or is that all you're
capable of giving him?

272
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,792
Okay, I have a patient
in 15 minutes.

273
00:09:38,834 --> 00:09:40,000
We can either spend that time

274
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,041
discussing regressive
bed-wetting

275
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,500
or we can get our ya-yas out.

276
00:09:42,542 --> 00:09:44,375
Up to you.

277
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,208
Take your pants off.

278
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,667
I'm going home.

279
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:57,750
Hey, there's a, uh,
beauty pageant on tonight.

280
00:09:57,792 --> 00:09:59,291
You want to come over
and make mean jokes

281
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,000
during the talent portion?

282
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,917
No, thanks.

283
00:10:06,917 --> 00:10:08,291
Look, are you taking
an iron supplement?

284
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:09,542
You look pale.

285
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:12,041
You don't want
gestational anemia.

286
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,333
Amelia...

287
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:17,917
I mean, there are no words
to describe how awful

288
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:21,417
and... unfair this is
to you.

289
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,041
And I get that, but...

290
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,709
I miss you.

291
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,709
I want you in my life.
I want you in Henry's life.

292
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,917
I-I want--

293
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:33,041
I understand what you want,
Addison.

294
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:35,583
I just don't care.

295
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,166
Somebody stabbed my baby.

296
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:49,583
How could that happen?

297
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,000
There's no logic to it.

298
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:54,709
You can't even begin to--
to rationalize it.

299
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,500
I can see what this is
doing to your wife.

300
00:10:56,542 --> 00:10:58,583
How do you think missy
is holding up?

301
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,041
What?

302
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,917
H-How do you think she's
doing with all of this?

303
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:04,041
Why does that matter?

304
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,625
Uh, well, there's, um...

305
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:08,083
Several very good doctors
looking after drea

306
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,166
and this is
a very traumatic event,

307
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:13,041
so I was thinking if you'd like
me to, I can speak to missy--

308
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,083
no.

309
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,959
Okay.

310
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,166
Can I ask you why?

311
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,291
I just...

312
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,625
Look, I don't need
another person

313
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:24,291
telling me she's careless
and has bad judgment

314
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,041
and--and is heading
in the wrong direction, okay?

315
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,291
That's not what I was gonna
talk to her about--

316
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,917
my baby girl is fighting
for her life,

317
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,125
and how missy feels
really isn't my primary concern.

318
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,041
I don't need a referendum
on my parenting.

319
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,041
I'm so sorry.

320
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,542
I can see how this is
upsetting you.

321
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,500
Please just leave us
the hell alone.

322
00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:44,041
How's the family holding up?

323
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,041
Mom's destroyed,
dad's furious.

324
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,458
And missy?

325
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,875
Uh, I don't know.
He won't let me talk to her.

326
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:49,041
She's probably
still in shock.

327
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,041
Maybe.

328
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:52,458
Violet?

329
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,041
Well, her--her affect
seemed a little off.

330
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,208
What do you mean?
She was upset.

331
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,625
Well, until she wasn't,
you know?

332
00:11:57,667 --> 00:11:59,041
She was crying
and then she stopped.

333
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:01,208
It was like a-a performance
that she turned off.

334
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,417
What I saw was a little girl
who was traumatized

335
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:06,083
by seeing her sister
near death.

336
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,083
Everybody reacts differently
to something like that.

337
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,583
I realize that, Pete,
but my instincts

338
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,208
are telling me that
something else is going on.

339
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,417
I...

340
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:15,041
I'm a shrink.
I do this for a living.

341
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,709
Yeah, and you do it
at home

342
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,875
and the grocery store,
the dry cleaners.

343
00:12:18,917 --> 00:12:21,500
Violet, you insert yourself
into people's lives.

344
00:12:21,542 --> 00:12:23,500
You think you know them better
than they know themselves.

345
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:25,917
Can't you just turn it off?

346
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:28,166
No, I can't.

347
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:30,291
And ignoring a problem

348
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,917
doesn't mean
that it's gonna go away.

349
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:35,000
And I think there's
a big problem here.

350
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:44,041
Sometimes I think I'm living
with 2 9 year olds.

351
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,500
Mason at least
is an actual kid.

352
00:12:47,542 --> 00:12:49,417
But Cooper, ahh...

353
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,417
He is just pitching a fit
because he doesn't want to do

354
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,834
what Violet thinks
he should do for Mason,

355
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:56,041
not to mention

356
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:59,041
what I think he should do.

357
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,625
I could use a meeting.

358
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:03,250
You want to come?

359
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:08,250
And listen to you share
about how difficult it is

360
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:09,834
to raise a child?

361
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,792
Sorry.

362
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:13,875
I didn't mean it like that.

363
00:13:13,917 --> 00:13:16,583
And what you're going through,
I know it must be--

364
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,458
no, you don't know.

365
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,959
You just don't.

366
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:27,959
Have you been going
to meetings?

367
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,458
You need to keep working
the steps--

368
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,000
skip the bill w. Crap.
I am not gonna use.

369
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,458
So you and Addison

370
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,750
and Violet can all check me
off your to-do lists

371
00:13:37,792 --> 00:13:39,041

I felt like I saw
a little something

Jake,

390
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,417
I was with Addison
for a long time.

391
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,542
I know her.

392
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,625
There was a vibe
going on.

393
00:14:24,667 --> 00:14:26,834
Tell me I'm wrong.

394
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:29,125
All right, look, we kissed
the day she got Henry.

395
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,875

Oh, look, man, you weren't
interested in her

400
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,667
when she wanted
to get pregnant.

401
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:40,041
Now all of a sudden,
she's got a baby,

402
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,625
and you're mad at me
because I kissed her?

403

406
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,250
All right, Henry,

00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:55,625
let's talk nannies.

408
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:58,667
Lisa has a degree
in early child development.

409
00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:00,041
Oh, but the way
she smacked her gum

410
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,041
the entire time
she talked with us

411
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,041
was a little disconcerting.

412
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,041
- Next.
- Keisha.

413
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,208
Premed, interested in peds.

414
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,667
She engaged you
without being condescending.

415
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:12,834
Definitely worth
a second interview.

416
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:17,500
Jake kissed Addison.

417
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,291
And that bothers you.

418
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,041
Well...

419
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,542
Addison and I, we--
we kissed that day, too.

420
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,041
So...

421
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,041
At the same time?

422
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,041
This isn't funny, man.

423
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,041
I'm sorry.

424
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,667
I know this isn't
what you want to hear,

425
00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:34,750
but you and Addison--nobody
can keep up with you two.

426
00:15:34,792 --> 00:15:37,041
You're on again, off again,
kissing, fighting,

427
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:39,083
babies, no babies, i--

428
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,041
so are you defending Jake?
Is that--

429
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,250
no, I'm just saying,
I can see

430
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:42,709
how he would think
Addison is fair game.

431
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,041
Look,

432
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:47,417
if you really want
to be with Addison,

433
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:50,542
get off your ass and tell Jake
to back the hell off.

434
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,709
I put something new
in your lunch today.

435
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,667
Moonpie.

436
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:00,583
It's pretty delicious.

437
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:03,250
It is for dessert
if you eat...

438
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,291
Your whole sandwich.

439
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:08,083
You can toss it
if you don't like it,

440
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,041
and we'll try something else.

441
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:12,000
Okay?

442
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,667
Mase...

443
00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:23,083
What are we gonna do
with you?

444
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,500
You're not talking to me.

445
00:16:24,542 --> 00:16:26,875
You're not talking
to your daddy.

446
00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:29,750
Your teachers say you won't
talk to anyone at school.

447
00:16:29,792 --> 00:16:33,709
You don't really want to go
through life like this, do you?

448
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,542
Look...

449
00:16:37,417 --> 00:16:39,333
I know you're hurtin'

450
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:43,208
in a way a kid never should.

451
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:47,291
I lost my daddy
as an adult,

452
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,375
and it nearly wrecked me.

453
00:16:49,417 --> 00:16:52,083
So this...

454
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:54,625
I can't imagine.

455
00:16:54,667 --> 00:16:58,166
I've tried to be the person
in your life

456
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:00,041
who always tells you
the whole truth,

457
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,166
even if it's hard.

458
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:04,834
And that's
what I'm doing now.

459
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,458
You can't not communicate.

460
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,125
It's gonna make it impossible
for anyone to help you.

461
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,875
So right here,

462
00:17:11,917 --> 00:17:13,583
right now,

463
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:16,250
you can say
whatever you want.

464
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:19,709
But you have to
say something.

465
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:29,583
I'm starting
to forget things.

466
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,667
Like what?

467
00:17:31,709 --> 00:17:34,041
The way my mom
packs lunch.

468
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:37,375
The kind of things
we'd talk about.

469
00:17:37,417 --> 00:17:39,166
It makes me sad.

470
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:44,417
I can see how that would.

471
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,917
We can talk about that.

472
00:17:46,959 --> 00:17:49,667
We can talk about anything.

473
00:17:49,709 --> 00:17:51,875
I don't want to.

474
00:17:51,917 --> 00:17:56,041
I know my mom wanted us
to talk about her.

475
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,667
And I know you and my dad
want things to be normal.

476
00:17:58,709 --> 00:18:01,417
But I don't feel normal.

477
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:05,000
And I don't want to talk.

478
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,542
No spontaneous breath.

479
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,041
That's consistent
with her e.E.G.

480
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,083
Drea is brain dead.

481
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:26,709
Amelia, are you--

482
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,041
I'll be fine.

483
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:29,667
Why don't you let me
tell the parents anyway?

484
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:32,041
This has nothing to do with
what's happening with me.

485
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,834
Amelia.

486
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,875
I'm gonna tell the parents.

487
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,709
What does that mean,
brain dead?

488
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,917
It means, she's not gonna
come out of this coma

489
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:52,959
and she can't breathe
on her own.

490
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,291
Brain death is more of
a--of a clinical determination.

491
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,291
The--the questions that
you're gonna be processing

492
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:01,333
are less medical
and more spiritual.

493
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,917
You mean, do we take
drea off the respirator?

494
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:05,542
And if so, when?

495
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:06,917
That's right.

496
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:08,792
Well, how long can she stay
like she is?

497
00:19:08,834 --> 00:19:11,125
We can keep her breathing
on the respirator indefinitely.

498
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,250
But she won't wake up,
and her body

499
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,875
will just continue
to deteriorate.

500
00:19:14,917 --> 00:19:16,041
Oh, god.

501
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,083
So there's no decision
to make.

502
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:20,750
Well, sometimes,
in situations like this,

503
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:24,750
a family will decide to donate
their loved one's organs.

504
00:19:24,792 --> 00:19:28,917
You mean, like, cut her open
and take everything out?

505
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,917
Missy, would you like
to take a walk?

506
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:32,041
No.

507
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,291
Yeah, you know, actually,

508
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,041
that--
that's a good suggestion.

509
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,291
No, I-I don't want
to miss any of this.

510
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,208
There's a--there's
a cafeteria downstairs.

511
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,917
No, I want to stay here.

512
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:41,291
You heard your mother.

513
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:51,208
Hey, I just, uh,
wanted to check in.

514
00:19:53,417 --> 00:19:55,750
Addison send you?

515
00:19:55,792 --> 00:19:57,959
No, but, uh, I know

516
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,458
you two aren't...

517
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,250
Look, I don't know if you've
picked another o.B. Yet or not,

518
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:06,041
but if you wanted to talk
about your options...

519
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,041
What options?

520
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,667
This is way past the time
for termination.

521
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,041
Well, there's still
a future to plan for.

522
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,333
My baby has no future.

523
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:16,125
But you do.

524
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,041
So what,
we're gonna hold hands

525
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:24,166
and talk about my feelings?

526
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:27,041
I'm sick to death
of people wanting

527
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,458
to discuss my feelings.

528
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,041
That's your business.
Not mine.

529
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,500
Thank you.

530
00:20:36,542 --> 00:20:38,041
But you're a doctor,

531
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,250
so you know you need
blood and urine tests.

532
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:43,250
Prenatal care is not
just about the baby.

533
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:46,041
I'm here about your health,
Amelia,

534
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,041
and...

535
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:51,291
I'm here about you,

536
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,333
because you do have a future.

537
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:59,000
Is it...

538
00:21:00,834 --> 00:21:02,959
The drugs I took...

539
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,750
Did I do this to my baby?

540
00:21:07,792 --> 00:21:10,041
Absolutely not.

541
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,417
Listen to me, this...

542
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:15,291
This was a bad spin
of the genetic wheel.

543
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,000
You didn't do anything wrong.

544
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,333
Hey, this is not
your fault.

545
00:21:41,917 --> 00:21:43,041
I know what happens

546
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,250
when they take someone
off of life support.

547
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:47,458
A lot of times,
they don't die right away.

548
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,125
They gag and struggle,

549
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:52,709
and it gets all messy.

550
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,375
Did what...

551
00:21:55,417 --> 00:21:57,333
Did what happened
to your sister

552
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:58,792
scare you?

553
00:22:00,709 --> 00:22:01,917
Well, it would scare me.

554
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:07,709
You know,
I was attacked once

555
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,375
and stabbed.

556
00:22:09,417 --> 00:22:11,375
Somebody cut my baby
out of me

557
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:15,125
and left me on the floor
of my house bleeding to death.

558
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:20,709
You know, sometimes, I...

559
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,625
Sometimes, I wonder what
the woman who attacked me felt

560
00:22:24,667 --> 00:22:27,583
when she was holding
that knife...

561
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:31,041
Coming toward me.

562
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:34,000
I mean, well,
she probably felt...

563
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:36,834
Powerful,

564
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:39,834
like she had all the control.

565
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:42,792
You know, like she could...

566
00:22:42,834 --> 00:22:45,834
Hurt you or kill you or...

567
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:51,208
Do anything she wanted.

568
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:58,834
But I could be wrong.

569
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,875
I mean, I-I had no idea
that I was walking into

570
00:23:02,917 --> 00:23:05,041
what is obviously a totally
dysfunctional relationship

571
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,667
between two people
who have no idea

572
00:23:06,709 --> 00:23:08,041
what the hell
they want from each other.

573
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:09,333
Maybe they're in love.

574
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:10,750
If she wants to be
kissing Sam,

575
00:23:10,792 --> 00:23:12,125
why is she kissing me?

576
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:14,917
Well, when we were going out, it
was a little different 'cause--

577
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:16,291
what?

578
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:18,291
You t--
you dated Addison, too?

579
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:19,917
You didn't know that?

580
00:23:19,959 --> 00:23:22,041
Man, is there any guy in this
practice she hasn't dated?

581
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:26,041
Just the three of us
to my knowledge.

582
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:28,375
All right, so if you were me,
what would you do?

583
00:23:28,417 --> 00:23:31,792
Well, Addison is, um...

584
00:23:31,834 --> 00:23:34,000
She's beautiful,
smart, funny,

585
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:36,291
but she's... complicated.

586
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:39,041
I couldn't make it work,
but if you can,

587
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:40,917
she's worth it.

588
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,917
Oh.

589
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:48,959
I didn't think we were
doing this till later,

590
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,250
but I like your ambition,
Dr. King.

591
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:52,917
Mason talked.

592
00:23:52,959 --> 00:23:56,041
What? That's--that...
How'd you get him to do that?

593
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:57,959
I told him silence wasn't
an option anymore,

594
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,542
that it was causing
more problems for all of us--
Charlotte.

595
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:02,417
Coop, it worked.

596
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:03,750
Well,
because you threatened him.

597
00:24:03,792 --> 00:24:05,041
I didn't threaten him.

598
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:06,333
You just said that you told him
that silence wasn't--

599
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:07,750
Coop, I thought
you'd be happy.

600
00:24:07,792 --> 00:24:10,041
- No, what I am is...
- Concerned

601
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:12,041
that Mason is not
getting enough time

602
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,250
to grieve the way
that he needs to.

603
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:15,041
I mean, all due respect
to Violet,

604
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:16,625
and frankly,
even less to you,

605
00:24:16,667 --> 00:24:18,625
I don't want anybody
making this about us.

606
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:21,583
It is about Mason
and what he needs.

607
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:23,166
You really think
this little of me?

608
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:26,166
Again, Charlotte,
not about you.

609
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:28,041
That's not a confession.

610
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:29,542
Well, if you had seen her
and heard her...

611
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:31,750
Did she actually tell you
that she killed her sister?

612
00:24:31,792 --> 00:24:33,041
No, not in so many words.

613
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:34,542
Then what
are we talking about?
My gut instinct.

614
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:36,166
I know I'm right on this.

Violet, no offense,

616
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:39,000
but you think you're right
about everything.

617
00:24:39,041 --> 00:24:40,166
That's not fair.

Uh, listen, okay, I'm sorry.

Jasmine, how can you
be this blind?

712
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:52,709
No, you're--
you're just upset.

713
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:55,041
Missy may have killed
our child.

714
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:57,709
Missy is our child.

715
00:29:05,291 --> 00:29:07,625
So, uh, night-light is on

716
00:29:07,667 --> 00:29:10,917
and we are
right down the hall.

717
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:12,709
Hey, I have
a light day tomorrow.

718
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,709
I was thinking I could
pick you up after school,

719
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:17,875
we could go the park
or something.

720
00:29:17,917 --> 00:29:22,542
Are you really sticking
with the no-talking thing?

721
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,917
Charlotte said you talked
to her this morning.

722
00:29:28,959 --> 00:29:30,333
How was that?

723
00:29:38,083 --> 00:29:40,542
I am frustrated because you
were condescending to me.

724
00:29:40,583 --> 00:29:42,125
You completely dismissed
my totally justified concerns...

725
00:29:42,166 --> 00:29:44,041
No, I just didn't agree.
About our patient.

726
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:45,667
I didn't dismiss it. I d--
no, dismissing is exactly
what you did.

727
00:29:45,709 --> 00:29:47,083
Oh, seriously, Violet?

728
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:48,875
Are you totally unaware
of how often you tell me

729
00:29:48,917 --> 00:29:51,208
what I think, what I feel,
why I do what I do?

730
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:53,041
I--she--she forced me to get
in touch with my family.

731
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:55,000
Which turned out to be
a very good thing.

732
00:29:55,041 --> 00:29:56,166
Or--but--but it wasn't
your call.

733
00:29:56,208 --> 00:29:57,375
Oh, come on, Pete.

734
00:29:57,417 --> 00:29:59,000
I am not Lucas.
I'm a grown man--

735
00:29:59,041 --> 00:30:00,166
well, and yet our toddler is
more in touch with his feelings

736
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:01,792
than you are and--and better
at articulating them.

737
00:30:01,834 --> 00:30:03,250
Okay, now that
is a low blow.

738
00:30:03,291 --> 00:30:04,709
Pete, you are
so emotionally cut off

739
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,709
and so unwilling to communicate
that I have no choice

740
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,959
but to analyze
and ascribe motive.

741
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,333
I don't even know
why our marriage is dying.

742
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:11,917
Honestly, Pete,
how did we get here?

743
00:30:11,959 --> 00:30:13,667
I don't know,
but I'm sure we'll discover

744
00:30:13,709 --> 00:30:15,458
that it was all my fault!

745
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:23,041
Why do you look so smug?

746
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:25,709
I'm just hopeful
for the two of you.

747
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:28,041
What you're reading as smug,
that's--that's hope.

748
00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:29,041
Were you not listening--

749
00:30:29,083 --> 00:30:30,709
I was listening.

750
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:33,291
And it--it was ugly.

751
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:35,166
But ugly can be honest.

752
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:38,041
Ugly can give the other person
a chance to change.

753
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:40,000
Ugly gives me hope.

754
00:30:40,041 --> 00:30:41,917
When it was all about
being polite,

755
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:44,667
your marriage
didn't stand a chance.

756
00:30:56,375 --> 00:31:00,000
I can't imagine your pain,
knowing what comes next.

757
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:02,750
But I do know this,

758
00:31:02,792 --> 00:31:05,458
you're not dealing with it.

759
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,125
Charlotte, I'm fine.

760
00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:09,000
That's crap.

761
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:11,041
Keeping everything
you're going through inside,

762
00:31:11,083 --> 00:31:13,041
shutting out
the people who love you,

763
00:31:13,083 --> 00:31:15,125
that's not dealing.

764
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:16,250
It's hiding.

765
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:19,875
You and I, we don't have
the luxury

766
00:31:19,917 --> 00:31:23,041
of ignoring our emotions,
hoping they'll just go away.

767
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:25,834
That bites people like us
in the ass.

768
00:31:25,875 --> 00:31:28,041
The only way you're gonna
get through this

769
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:29,458
is to let yourself feel

770
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,500
every heartbreaking,
gut-wrenching part of it.

771
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:40,792
You're right.

772
00:31:40,834 --> 00:31:44,041
I just haven't been ready.

773
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:46,917
You want to go
to a meeting?

774
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:52,750
Could we maybe sit here
for a minute instead?

775
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:56,291
Of course.

776
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:09,000
I'm just numb,
Charlotte.

777
00:32:10,959 --> 00:32:14,542
That's a start.

778
00:32:17,375 --> 00:32:19,875
Remember when we were
talking about the woman

779
00:32:19,917 --> 00:32:21,834
who attacked me,

780
00:32:21,875 --> 00:32:23,333
and you said
she probably did it

781
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:25,291
to feel more powerful?

782
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:26,500
At first I thought

783
00:32:26,542 --> 00:32:29,041
you were so smart
to figure that out,

784
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:32,625
but now I think
you're wrong.

785
00:32:32,667 --> 00:32:35,333
I think she was
probably jealous.

786
00:32:35,375 --> 00:32:37,417
I was having a baby,
and she wasn't.

787
00:32:37,458 --> 00:32:39,417
And she...

788
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:40,834
Lashed out.

789
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,667
And I don't think
she was thinking about

790
00:32:42,709 --> 00:32:45,250
what was gonna happen after,
to her or to me.

791
00:32:45,291 --> 00:32:48,625
She was...
She was just crazy.

792
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:52,000
Well, maybe--

793
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:54,917
come on, missy. Why else
would you stab someone?

794
00:32:54,959 --> 00:32:57,500
To know if you could
really do it.

795
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:59,792
Yeah. I don't think so.

796
00:32:59,834 --> 00:33:02,792
I mean, to actually put
a knife into someone else,

797
00:33:02,834 --> 00:33:04,250
it's...

798
00:33:04,291 --> 00:33:06,667
It's really too scary
for most sane people.

799
00:33:06,709 --> 00:33:08,667
It's only scary
for a minute.

800
00:33:08,709 --> 00:33:10,667
And then you push past that,

801
00:33:10,709 --> 00:33:13,458
and you're just...
You're...

802
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,500
In it, and...

803
00:33:15,542 --> 00:33:17,542
Well, maybe that's the way
it seems in movies

804
00:33:17,583 --> 00:33:20,709
or--or books that you've read,
but in--in real life--

805
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:21,917
no, no, no, no.

806
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:24,667
I'm talking about
in real life.

807
00:33:32,083 --> 00:33:35,625
I was the one
who stabbed drea.

808
00:33:35,667 --> 00:33:39,041
And it...
It wasn't that scary.

809
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:41,166
I mean, I knew I wanted to,

810
00:33:41,208 --> 00:33:44,500
to see what it was like.

811
00:33:44,542 --> 00:33:47,041
And it was...

812
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:50,125
It was the coolest thing
I have ever done.

813
00:33:50,166 --> 00:33:52,250
And I mean,
you're totally right,

814
00:33:52,291 --> 00:33:56,583
I didn't think about
what comes after.

815
00:33:56,625 --> 00:33:59,041
You have the right
to remain silent.
Wait. Wait.

816
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:01,041
Anything you say can and will
be used against you...
You--what?

817
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:03,125
In a court of law. You have
the right to have...
No, no, you said
you understood.

818
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,959
An attorney present
during questioning.
You need help, missy.

819
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,792
No, no, no, no.
You said you understood.

820
00:34:06,834 --> 00:34:09,792
Wait. No. Wait.
I thought you understood.

821
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,625
You okay?

822
00:34:19,417 --> 00:34:21,458
Oh.

823
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,166
Yeah, he wouldn't go down
last night, so...

824
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:26,583
Now that he's finally asleep,
I didn't want to move him.

825
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:29,000
He looks so peaceful.

826
00:34:29,041 --> 00:34:31,583
And my spine is actually
fused to this chair.

827
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:39,917
So I know
that you kissed Jake.

828
00:34:41,875 --> 00:34:43,792
I'm not gonna make
a big deal...
Sam.

829
00:34:43,834 --> 00:34:45,875
Out of it, but--

830
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,709
I'm sorry about that.
Truly, I am.

831
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:50,041
But...

832
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:52,709
Uh, you, me, Jake--
that seems like a lifetime ago.

833
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:55,875
I am just...

834
00:34:55,917 --> 00:34:58,625
Just consumed
with this little boy.

835
00:34:58,667 --> 00:35:03,000
And now I'm just
a sleep-deprived mom...

836
00:35:04,291 --> 00:35:07,333
In love with her child.

837
00:35:07,375 --> 00:35:09,875
Hmm?

838
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:20,959
Oh, sorry.

839
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,083
I'm Dr. Shepherd.

840
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:27,583
I did your daughter's
neuro exam.

841
00:35:33,083 --> 00:35:34,917
My wife
couldn't be here anymore.

842
00:35:34,959 --> 00:35:36,750
Maybe that's easier.

843
00:35:36,792 --> 00:35:38,667
Huh. There's no easy.

844
00:35:38,709 --> 00:35:40,583
There's...

845
00:35:40,625 --> 00:35:42,792
There's no good.

846
00:35:42,834 --> 00:35:45,041
My family's destroyed,

847
00:35:45,083 --> 00:35:46,500
and missy is responsible

848
00:35:46,542 --> 00:35:50,125
for my baby girl
being gone.

849
00:35:50,166 --> 00:35:52,542
How do I deal with that?
How...

850
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:55,333
How do I go on?

851
00:36:00,083 --> 00:36:02,000
I don't know.

852
00:36:03,834 --> 00:36:06,625
Drea's life
should count for more...

853
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:09,750
For something.

854
00:36:13,166 --> 00:36:17,583
Uh, Dr. Wilder
said something about...

855
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:20,375
Donating organs.

856
00:36:24,083 --> 00:36:28,000
You could do that.

857
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:30,750
She could do that.

858
00:36:30,792 --> 00:36:32,959
And that would matter.

859
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,125
Right?

860
00:36:38,083 --> 00:36:41,041
To a lot of people...

861
00:36:41,083 --> 00:36:43,834
That would matter
a great deal.

862
00:37:00,333 --> 00:37:02,375
You two got
all tangled up

863
00:37:02,417 --> 00:37:04,000
in here last session.

864
00:37:04,041 --> 00:37:06,333
I'd like to unpack that

865
00:37:06,375 --> 00:37:08,458
so we can understand

866
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,041
what you both really want
to communicate--

867
00:37:10,083 --> 00:37:12,083
I have something to say.

868
00:37:12,125 --> 00:37:14,875
You both think that
if we...

869
00:37:14,917 --> 00:37:17,041
Sit in our misery,
if we unpack it,

870
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:19,583
if we reexamine every fight
we've ever had,

871
00:37:19,625 --> 00:37:21,625
that that's gonna get us
someplace new, is that right?

872
00:37:21,667 --> 00:37:23,041
No, that's not exactly--

873
00:37:23,083 --> 00:37:24,625
uh, no, no, no,
it's not exact,

874
00:37:24,667 --> 00:37:27,041
but that's about right.

875
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:29,083
And I think the problem
that we're having

876
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:31,041
is that
I fundamentally disagree.

877
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:32,875
I-I want to have fun.

878
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,500
Yeah, I want to laugh.

879
00:37:34,542 --> 00:37:36,625
I wanna--i want us
to love each other,

880
00:37:36,667 --> 00:37:38,417
because we do
love each other.

881
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:41,000
And I think that is
more important

882
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:43,333
than unpacking all the crap

883
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:46,041
that we've
been lugging around.

884
00:37:46,083 --> 00:37:48,041
So... let's not unpack it.

885
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:49,750

993
00:41:46,834 --> 00:41:48,500
I mean, Sam knows I kissed
both him and Jake,

994
00:41:48,542 --> 00:41:50,041
and that's okay, too.

995
00:41:50,083 --> 00:41:52,959
