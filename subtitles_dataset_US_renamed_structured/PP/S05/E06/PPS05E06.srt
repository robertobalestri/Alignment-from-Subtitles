I've had this song
stuck in my head,

00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:09,709
like all day, all night.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,125
I mean, I slept
for six hours last night,

5
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:13,500
and the song underscored
the entire six hours.

6
00:00:13,542 --> 00:00:15,000
What's the song?

7
00:00:15,041 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm looking for
sperm donors, you know?

8
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:18,291
I mean, I fell asleep

9
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:21,083
reading medical histories,
files.

10
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:23,792
I mean, you'd think
I'd dream about that.

11
00:00:23,834 --> 00:00:25,041
I'd like to hear the song.

12
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:26,792
Can you sing the part
that's stuck in your head?

13
00:00:26,834 --> 00:00:28,959
I don't sing.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,667
I don't judge.

15
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:35,041

00:01:02,667 --> 00:01:03,875
In your mind,

24
00:01:03,917 --> 00:01:06,709
who trusted you

25
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,041
Your ex-husband?

26
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:10,166
Derek? No. Why would I be
thinking about my ex-husband?

27
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:12,041
You're choosing donors,
you're moving forward

28
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:15,208
into a bold new chapter.

29
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,583
Sometimes moving forward
makes us look back.

30
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:20,625
No, I'm not looking back.
All right?

31
00:01:20,667 --> 00:01:22,250
It was just a stupid song
in my head.

32
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:25,458
It's never
just a song in your head.

33
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:13,917
Mm.

34
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:15,458
Hi.

35
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,125
Morning.

36
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:19,291
I'm really sorry about this,

37
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:20,959
because if you are
as hungover as I am,

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,166
it sucks to wake up
this early,

39
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,709
but I gotta go to work,

40
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,792
which means
you've gotta get out.

41
00:02:25,834 --> 00:02:28,792
All right.

42
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:32,041
But, like...

43
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:33,792
Now.

44
00:02:34,834 --> 00:02:36,917
Because I'm late.

45
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,375
Right. Okay.

46
00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:58,750
The Ferrari 458 spyder,

47
00:02:58,792 --> 00:03:00,417
is powered by a 4.5-liter v8.

48
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:03,208
It can hit 62 miles an hour
in less than 3.5 seconds

49
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,709
and reach a top speed
of over 198 miles per hour.

50
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,750
Well, that sounds
really good.

51
00:03:08,792 --> 00:03:10,959
I'm more of a Porsche guy
myself, but--

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,417
Dr. Freedman,

53
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,458
porsches are not as cool
as ferraris.

54
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,959
- Oh.
- Ollie.

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,458
Ollie, can you take that Ferrari
out to the waiting room?

56
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,000
We need to talk
to Dr. Freedman.

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,041
Drive carefully.
It's a zoo out there.

58
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:25,250
Okay?

59
00:03:26,834 --> 00:03:29,041
Um... Well,
he's certainly high energy.

60
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,583
But his blood pressure's
normal,

61
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,834
and the tests came back negative
for any kind of thyroid issue.

62
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,834
So I can't find
any physical triggers

63
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,041
for hyperactivity.

64
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,625
So you think he's a.D.H.D.,
just like Brian?

65
00:03:38,667 --> 00:03:41,041
It could be.
Um, how is Brian?

66
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:42,500
He just got into Stanford.

67
00:03:42,542 --> 00:03:44,041
What?
Congratulations.

68
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,500
You gotta give him
a high-five for me.

69
00:03:45,542 --> 00:03:46,625
Although, he's 18.

70
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:47,792
He probably doesn't want
a high-five

71
00:03:47,834 --> 00:03:48,792
from his pediatrician.

72
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:50,917
Dr. Freedman,
if Ollie has it, too,

73
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:51,834
we would like to treat it

74
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,875
as early and as aggressively
as possible.

75
00:03:53,917 --> 00:03:55,417
I don't know. I mean,
the way he was

76
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,041
rattling those stats off
about that car,

77
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,792
it doesn't sound like a kid
who's having trouble focusing.

78
00:03:58,834 --> 00:04:00,375
And if he's
just a little bit hyper,

79
00:04:00,417 --> 00:04:02,625
you know, I was hyper
when I was a kid.

80
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:04,834
Respectfully, Dr. Freedman,

81
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,041
we've been
through this before.

82
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:07,667
A.d.h.d. Runs in the family,

83
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:09,792
and the medication
really helped Brian.
Mm-hmm.

84
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:11,792
Yeah, I mean, Brian was a little
bit older when we diagnosed him.

85
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:14,667
Ollie is having tantrums.
He's throwing fits.

86
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:16,041
Okay. I just don't want
to jump the gun.

87
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:18,041
But there are
some other tests we can run.

88
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,041
Uh, my associate,
who is a therapist,

89
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,917
Dr. Sheldon Wallace,
could probably see you today.

90
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,291
Great. Thank you.

91
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,041
Hey. Any progress?

92
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,750
Mm. Okay.

93
00:04:31,792 --> 00:04:34,417
I think...

94
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:37,041
I have it boiled down
to...

95
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:40,041
The classical musician
and the geologist.

96
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,125
Okay, I'm gonna go ahead
and rename them

97
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,667
soft and softer.

98
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:45,875
I'm sorry?

99
00:04:45,917 --> 00:04:47,041
The geologist--
that was the weird kid

100
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,458
who was always obsessed
with rocks

101
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,709
because he couldn't find
any friends.

102
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,917
Definitely didn't have
any girlfriends.

103
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,750
And the classical musician--

104
00:04:53,792 --> 00:04:55,083
no, musicians are hot.

105
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,041
No, rock stars are hot.

106
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:58,500
Classical musicians
are soft.

107
00:04:58,542 --> 00:05:01,083
You gotta find a donor
that's got a little more...

108
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:02,792
Testosterone.

109
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:04,041
Sam... look, i-i--

110
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:08,291
I've thrown out 48 donors
on medical history alone.

111
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,792
I mean, I've eliminated
all potential for heart disease,

112
00:05:10,834 --> 00:05:12,542
stroke, uh, dementia.

113
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,041
I mean, are you really--

114
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,875
are you really telling me
that I now need to consider

115
00:05:15,917 --> 00:05:17,375
potential testosterone levels?

116
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:18,917
I'm just saying, you're--

117
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:21,083
you're gonna be
an amazing mother, all right?

118
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:22,959
But this kid, you know,
is not gonna have a dad,

119
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,041
so it already is gonna have
enough soft, all right?

120
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,500
Having a donor that's got
a little bit more testosterone

121
00:05:27,542 --> 00:05:29,041
might not be
such a bad thing.

122
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,125
You know what? My--my f.S.H.
Is through the roof,

123
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:32,709
I'm a woman in my 40's.

124
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,291
I mean, there's a good chance
that even with

125
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,125
all these
crazy-making hormones I'm on

126
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,709
that I'm still
the eggless wonder.

127
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,709
I mean, I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

128
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,375
Addison. Addison.

129
00:05:41,417 --> 00:05:43,041
You always get
what you want.

130
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,041
Now is this something
that you really want?

131
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,083
Yes, I want this.

132
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,333
All right, then.

133
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,166
So pick some sperm,

134
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:54,208
just make sure it's got
some testosterone in it.

135
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,000
What game
are you playing?

136
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,041
"Drive."

137
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm about to get three stars
on every level.

138
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,041
Wow.
That's very impressive.

139
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:03,041
How are your grades
in school?

140
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:04,208
Bad.

141
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,041
I got a "b" in English.

142
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,458
Three stars!

143
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,000
A "b" is bad?

144
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:14,041
Tell Dr. Wallace
how hard it is for you

145
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,208
to do your homework alone.

146
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,834
Mom and dad always
help me on my homework

147
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,041
because it takes me
too long on my own.

148
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,000
And you can't sit still

149
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,000
during reading time
at school, right?

150
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,667
When can we go home?

151
00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:29,041
May I speak with Ollie
privately?

152
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,041
I don't see
why that's necessary.

153
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,041
He's 8, and he's
perfectly well-adjusted.

154
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,917
He doesn't need therapy.

155
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,041
Well, if he's
perfectly well-adjusted,

156
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,625
then why are you here?

157
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:39,041
He's hyperactive.

158
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:42,375
It would help me
to assess him

159
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:44,041
if I could have
a few moments with him.

160
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:46,041
He's a young boy.
You're a man we're just meeting.

161
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,542
We're not gonna leave him
alone with you.

162
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,875
Okay. I understand that.

163
00:06:50,917 --> 00:06:52,250
Why don't we make
an appointment

164
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,250
for him to take
some diagnostic tests?

165
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:57,500
And if you give me the name
and number of his teacher,

166
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,291
I'll speak with her and...

167
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:01,417
Have her complete
some diagnostic inventories,

168
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,417
and... we'll get back
to you.

169
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,083
We didn't have to
go through all of that

170
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,041
when Brian was diagnosed.

171
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,667
Our diagnostic approach
has changed in the last decade

172
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:12,041
as we've come to
better understand the disorder.

173
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,041
And most people think
that's a good thing.

174
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,458
Prescribing any drug
for a child

175
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,417
is not something
that should be taken lightly.

176
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:18,917
Okay.

177
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:20,417
Well, thank you
for your time

178
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:23,041
and your somewhat startling
condescension.

179
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,041
Mrs. Graham--

180
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,125
we are good parents.

181
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,959
Our oldest son
is headed to Stanford,

182
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,917
and Ollie is on
the honor roll at school,

183
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:31,125
and that's not because
we're running around

184
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,041
getting prescriptions for drugs
that our kids don't need.

185
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,583
So thank you...
I--

186
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:35,583
for your time.

187
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:36,875
Come, sweetie.

188
00:07:36,917 --> 00:07:38,000
But we'll be finding
a new doctor.

189
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,250
Thank you.

190
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,041
Dr. Turner.

191
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,083
Have a seat.

192
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,250
You're very smiley today.

193
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,000
I get really smiley
when I have good news.

194
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:57,542
For this reason,
I'm terrible at poker.

195
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,083
F-For me?
You have good news for me?

196
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:01,959
The board has agreed
to revisit your case.

197
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,542
Revisit? Wh-what do you mean?
What does that mean?

198
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,166
It means we have work to do,

199
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:07,917
because we've convinced them
that suspending you for a year

200
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,750
was not in the best interest
of your patients.

201
00:08:09,792 --> 00:08:11,333
It means we have a shot,
Dr. Turner,

202
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,166
at getting you back to work
sometime soon.

203
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,375
Hey, Jason, I want you
to call me Violet

204
00:08:16,417 --> 00:08:18,333
because I'm gonna give you
a hug right now,

205
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:21,041
and for that, I think we need
to be on a first-name basis.

206
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,291
Thank you.

207
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,583
You're welcome.

208
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:36,000
You're late.

209
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,709
I'm not feeling well.

210
00:08:44,917 --> 00:08:47,417
Amelia.

211
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,041
Yeah.

212
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,041
I heard about
your friend Michelle.

213
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,041
I'm very sorry
for your loss.

214
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,375
Thanks.

215
00:08:56,417 --> 00:09:00,041
But it's not an excuse for you
dropping the ball at work.

216
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,750
You've been late repeatedly,

217
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:03,333
your charts are a mess.

218
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,000
If you need
a leave of absence

219
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,166
while you mourn your friend,
all you have to do is ask me.

220
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,375
Charlotte, all I need is
for you to get off my back.

221
00:09:09,417 --> 00:09:11,125
Do you think
you can do that?

222
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,166
I have a job to do here,
and--

223
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,458
this isn't your job.

224
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,417
Harassing me is not your job.

225
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,041
Babysitting me,
checking up on me,

226
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,041
breathalyzing me,
it's not your job.

227
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,583
It's your damn hobby.

228
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,041
You know, seriously,
Charlotte, what i--

229
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:25,667
what is your problem
with me?

230
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,083
What is your damage?

231
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,041
Hey, baby,
guess who I ran into today.

232
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,083
Aah!

233
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,166
Oh, my god.

234
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,667
Who the hell is she?

235
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,083
I'm his damn wife,
you whore.

236
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,792
Charlie, wait.
Now let me explain.
Aah!

237
00:09:47,834 --> 00:09:50,041
You son of a bitch!
How could you do this?

238
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:52,333
- I'll kill you!
- Get off of him!

239
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,250
I'll kill you!

240
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,208
A decade before Ollie was born,

241
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,208
that's how long I've been
treating this family,

242
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,458
and five minutes with you,

243
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,500
and they're running
for the door.

244
00:10:07,542 --> 00:10:08,625
You shouldn't have sent them
to me

245
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:10,041
if all you're looking for
was a rubber stamp.

246
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,667
I was looking for a second
opinion about the meds,

247
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:13,417
not some kind of judgment
about their parenting.

248
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:16,625
I mean, granted, Rosie is
a bit of a tiger mom,

249
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:18,458
and that can be off-putting,
but it's not uncommon.

250
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,417
I don't think
I got the whole story.

251
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,291
Ollie is
a little bit hyperactive,

252
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,333
but he doesn't seem like
he can't focus.

253
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:25,875
And his answers
seemed coached...
Oh.

254
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:27,959
You know, to put it mildly.
The whole thing was odd.

255
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,041
What, parents coached a kid so
he could score a.D.H.D. Drugs?

256
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,041
So says Sheldon.

257
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,542
I mean,
these are good parents.

258
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,041
I've known them a long time.
They're good people.

259
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:37,041
Good people make
terrible decisions every day.

260
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,333
My field is pretty much
based on that.

261
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:39,875
It doesn't surprise me.

262
00:10:39,917 --> 00:10:42,041
The diagnosis of a.D.H.D.
Is epidemic in this country.

263
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,583
We all know the hysteria,
Pete.

264
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,041
But that doesn't mean
it's not real

265
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,542
and it doesn't mean that Ollie's
faking it or was coached.

266
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,500
Okay, maybe these kids
are unfocused

267
00:10:48,542 --> 00:10:50,542
because we're pumping them
full of caffeine and sugar

268
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:51,542
and preservatives.

269
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:52,917
We should look at diet
and exercise

270
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,667
before we just write 'em
a scrip for speed.

271
00:10:54,709 --> 00:10:56,166
A.d.h.d. Drugs can be
very effective,

272
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,625
but they have to be used
sparingly

273
00:10:57,667 --> 00:10:59,041
and only in clear-cut cases.

274
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,417
Okay, I just don't
see that here, Cooper.

275
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:01,667
Yeah,
and if Sheldon is right,

276
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:03,583
the parents are coaching
their kid to get drugs,

277
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:04,625
it's--it's child abuse.

278
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:06,417
I need sperm.

279
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:10,041
I need you to help me
choose sperm.

280
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,041
I have to pick a donor today
and...

281
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,375
Oh, for the love of god.
I need a consult.

282
00:11:14,417 --> 00:11:17,500
Can you all... just please
give me a consult?

283
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:18,500
A sperm consult?

284
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:19,417
Shut up.

285
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:22,625
Please just shut up
and help me.

286
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,125
What is this,
fantasy football?

287
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,959
Fantasy sperm ball.

288
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,583
Really?

289
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,417
Don't judge.
I needed help.

290
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:43,041
All right. I say,
go with the historian.

291
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,417
History's cool.

292
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:45,667
How is history cool?

293
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:47,417
You understand that the baby
isn't necessarily

294
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:48,792
going to be an historian?

295
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:50,750
Yes, but the historian
is Greek,

296
00:11:50,792 --> 00:11:52,625
and they have some good genes.

297
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:54,375
They never sunburn, the Greeks.
They only tan.

298
00:11:54,417 --> 00:11:56,250
So you're saying
I should choose a donor

299
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,667
based on the amount
of melanin in his skin?

300
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:00,875
I mean, you're pale as a ghost.
You want to spend

301
00:12:00,917 --> 00:12:03,000
your whole kid's life
worrying about melanoma...
I think that's valid.

302
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,166
I'd tend to agree.

303
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,041
All right.
Take down the Swede.

304
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,500
Yeah, sure. The Swede is gone.

305
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:10,667
Okay, I think the phd

306
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:12,041
is gonna be too intellectual.

307
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,583
What's wrong with intellectual?

308
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,041
Well, Addison is fun-loving.

309
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,709
She doesn't want to sit around
analyzing everything all day--

310
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,041
are we talking about Addison
or--

311
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,875
oh, come on, Sheldon. I'm not
talking in metaphors here.

312
00:12:19,917 --> 00:12:22,041
Not consciously, but you did
just describe your wife.

313
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,041
Okay.
Ooh.

314
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,875
Focus, people.
We are running out of time.

315
00:12:24,917 --> 00:12:26,500
Now come on. Let's do the pros
and cons of the pro athlete.

316
00:12:26,542 --> 00:12:28,250
Well, there--there are
no cons to a pro athlete.

317
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,709
Well, that depends
what sport he played

318
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,041
and how many times
he got hit in the head.

319
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,375
What, you think
his concussion rate

320
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:33,834
is directly related
to his spooge?

321
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,709
Can we please
not call it spooge?

322
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,625
You know, pro athletes generally
run high on testosterone.

323
00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:40,625
Mm-hmm.
 If you had a boy, it could be hard to handle.

324
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:42,125
Then you just
bring him to Cooper.

325
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,041
He'll dose him up on
some heavy pharmaceuticals...

326
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,542
You know what? You make this
so much less fun.

327
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,083
Where are the women
in this practice?

328
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,500
Where? Where are the women?

329
00:12:48,542 --> 00:12:50,041
Okay, Addison,
you're overthinking this.

330
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,458
Okay, what if you met some guy
at a bar,

331
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,917
and you accidentally
got pregnant?
I'm with Sam.

332
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,417
I mean, if you weren't.

333
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:55,875
Women get pregnant every day

334
00:12:55,917 --> 00:12:57,542
and give birth to babies
all the time

335
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,500
with guys who amount to
little more than sperm donors.

336
00:12:59,542 --> 00:13:01,041
Look at Cooper with this kid
he never knew about.

337
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,250
It's true. Although,
Erica kinda did hit

338
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,750
the sperm jackpot
with me.

339
00:13:04,792 --> 00:13:06,041
Mm. I vote for the activist,
for what it's worth.

340
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,208
Oh, yeah, they're
very level-headed.

341
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,458
Okay.

342
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,583
I vote for the Greek.

343
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:10,583
Okay.

344
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:11,542
I'd go with the phd.

345
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,542
But I might just be
shining a light

346
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,792
on my own narcissism.

347
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,458
Listen, you have a lot
of love to give,

348
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,041
and that's all
you should be focusing on.

349
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,917
The sperm is just...

350
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:25,000
Sperm.

351
00:13:42,834 --> 00:13:45,041
Excuse me.
This is not public property.

352
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,709
Get the hell off the deck.

353
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,625
Hey, you're home early.

354
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:50,041
Hey.

355
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,291
You're still here.
Yeah.

356
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,750
Well, you threw my clothes
at me this morning

357
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:55,750
and kicked me out,
which was, uh, actually...

358
00:13:55,792 --> 00:13:58,041
Strangely charming.

359
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,417
Uh, so I thought i'd--
what?

360
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:01,792
I don't know.

361
00:14:01,834 --> 00:14:03,166
Uh...

362
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:04,583
Get your phone number?

363
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:07,709
Also, i'm--I'm pretty sure
I left my wallet inside.

364
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,041
You have a name?

365
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,083
Ryan.

366
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,875
Ryan kerrigan.

367
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,333
Amelia Shepherd.

368
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,625
It's nice to meet you.

369
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:29,041
Nice to meet you, too.

370
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:34,291
You coming?

371
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:41,750
Ollie, come on! Stop!

372
00:14:41,792 --> 00:14:44,041
No! I don't want another doctor!
Ollie, please calm down!

373
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,041
Come on.
Ollie, stop.
It's all right.

374
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,041
Stop it.

375
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,041
Ollie, control your--
oh!

376
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,041
Oh, my god.
Ollie.

377
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,458
You hit your father.

378
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,834
I don't want
another doctor!
It's okay.

379
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,041
You don't need another doctor,
buddy. I'm here.

380
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,500
Okay, just breathe.
Just breathe. It's okay.

381
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:55,083
Any chance you want to give us
that prescription now?

382
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,500
Oh!

383
00:14:56,542 --> 00:14:59,250
I like you. You're fun.

384
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:00,917
You're fun.

385
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,041
I'm not fun.
I'm awesome.

386
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,208
You are awesome.

387
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,375
Could I ask you kind of
a personal question?

388
00:15:11,417 --> 00:15:12,583
Okay.

389
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,875
Where did we meet
last night?

390
00:15:14,917 --> 00:15:17,291
I have zero memory.

391
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:26,458
Yeah, you mix these
with a few drinks,

392
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,875
and memory sort of becomes
a thing of the past.

393
00:15:28,917 --> 00:15:30,083
Dude, you had party favors
in your pocket,

394
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:33,041
and you held out
this long?

395
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,500
So rude.

396
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:35,917
I want to make sure
you remembered my name.

397
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:38,750
What is my name?

398
00:15:38,792 --> 00:15:40,667
It's Ryan kerrigan.

399
00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:44,041
You passed.

400
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,959
You got a razor blade?

401
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,041
They're much better
if we chop them up.

402
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,750
Yeah.

403
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:52,041
Razor blade coming up.

404
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,417
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
it was this bad.

405
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,041
That was mild.

406
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,041
They get worse.

407
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,000
His mind is racing
all the time.

408
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,000
He barely sleeps.

409
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,041
Is he having, um, soda,

410
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,041
or any desserts
right before he goes to bed?

411
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,917
'Cause that could absolutely
interfere with sleep.

412
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:13,166
A little sugar
makes him do this?

413
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:15,959
I don't like soda
before bed.

414
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,041
I don't like to eat
so much anymore.

415
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:21,083
The medicine makes me feel
not hungry.

416
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,375
Oh, what--
what medicine?

417
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,458
Ollie, go to
the waiting room, okay?

418
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,166
Let us talk to Dr. Freedman.

419
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:29,166
Am I in trouble?
No.

420
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:30,333
No, Ollie,
you're not in trouble.

421
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,041
We just need to talk,
okay?

422
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:41,834
We had Brian's medication.

423
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,041
We just thought we would see
if it helped.

424
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,583
Oh, please don't look at me
that way, Dr. Freedman.

425
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,750
Was he having tantrums like this
before you started giving him

426
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:49,500
unprescribed amphetamines?

427
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:52,125
With a.D.H.D. Kids,
the drugs calm them.

428
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,041
So if his brain
is functioning normally,

429
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,041
of course he's amped up.

430
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,375
You're giving him speed.

431
00:16:56,417 --> 00:16:58,041
We thought
that it would help him.

432
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,041
You have to believe that.

433
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,417
And when you saw
that it wasn't?

434
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:03,041
We need him diagnosed so that he
can get extra time on his tests.

435
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:06,041
He needs the time.

436
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,542
Brian was a straight-a student
after his diagnosis,

437
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,792
but not before.

438
00:17:09,834 --> 00:17:11,458
Ollie's grades...

439
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,667
They're not
what they should be.

440
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:14,875
He's in third grade.

441
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:16,125
Dr. Freedman,
do you have any idea

442
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:18,041
what it's like out there
these days?

443
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:20,250
We're not wealthy people,
but we spent $12,000 a year

444
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:22,125
on tuition
for Ollie's preschool.

445
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,583
More for donations

446
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,041
so that the right grade school
would consider us.

447
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:29,542
We didn't go through that,
we didn't spend that much money

448
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,625
to have Ollie underperform
in grade school,

449
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:34,041
because then he won't get in
to the right high schools,

450
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:35,417
and we can forget about
the right college.

451
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,041
So you took
his brother's medicine,

452
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:39,041
you amped him up
so that I would diagnose him

453
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,417
so you could cheat
the school system?

454
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,041
You see a third grader.

455
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,083
But I am his mother,

456
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:47,417
and I see his entire future
in that report card.

457
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,417
You don't want to help us?
Fine.

458
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:52,750
But please, until you've
been there, don't judge us.

459
00:17:57,458 --> 00:18:00,792
And it's really
the strangest decision

460
00:18:00,834 --> 00:18:02,041
I've ever had to make.

461
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,083
You know, and i'm--I'm looking
at these baby pictures,

462
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,875
and, uh, these
family medical histories

463
00:18:06,917 --> 00:18:08,083
and personality assessments,

464
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,125
probably made
by the 21-year-old intern

465
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:14,083
who's Manning the desk
at the cryobank that night

466
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:16,083
when the 22-year-old
sperm donor

467
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:20,041
comes in to sell his sperm
for cash.

468
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,834
It's, uh, it's really
just disturbing is what it is.

469
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,709
I mean, the whole thing
is just so--
four.

470
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,709
What?

471
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,041
Four.

472
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:29,000
We got four.

473
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:32,041
Four eggs?

474
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,041
I made four eggs.

475
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,125
I mean, normally, I would
want eight or ten,

476
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:40,709
but, uh...
With my age, it's...

477
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,041
And your f.S.H. Levels,
I mean, this is--

478
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,667
I thought I was
the eggless wonder.

479
00:18:44,709 --> 00:18:47,041
Well, you are not
the eggless wonder.

480
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,166
Oh, my god.

481
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:50,959
Oh, my god. I've gotta, um...

482
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:54,000
I have to pick a donor,
right now.

483
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,166
No, no, no. Right now
I need to take these eggs

484
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:57,542
because you could start
ovulating any minute,

485
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:58,959
and I want to get them
before you do.

486
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,333
And then
you can pick a donor.

487
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:01,500
In fact, I have a friend
at the cryobank

488
00:19:01,542 --> 00:19:03,041
so we can get
a same-day delivery.

489
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,041
Oh, my god.

490
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:06,709
Oh, my gosh.

491
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,041
Uh... wait. You're gonna, um,

492
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,125
fertilize today?

493
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,000
Oh, i'm--
I'm knocking you out now.

494
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,291
Okay.

495
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:17,542
Okay?

496
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:20,375
Okay.

497
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,041
Why would any parents

498
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:31,291
want their kid saddled
with an a.D.H.D. Diagnosis?

499
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,834
Extended time
on standardized tests,

500
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,166
more attention from teachers.

501
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,417
So you get the kids
hopped up on drugs

502
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:38,041
to get 'em in
to a better college?

503
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,291
I think when they initially
started giving him the drugs,

504
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,041
they really thought
he had a.D.H.D.

505
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,083
I don't believe that
they would give--

506
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,291
those drugs are addictive,
Cooper.

507
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,291
They're not a toy.
Call the damn police.

508
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,041
Okay, I hear that.
I do.

509
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,083
But I don't really think
that the foster care system

510
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,834
is best for Ollie.

511
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,792
I guess I hear that, too.

512
00:19:52,834 --> 00:19:54,333
Dr. King, I hate
to bother you, but i--

513
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:55,333
you're not a bother.

514
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:56,458
I have a patient--
Kelly garrity.

515
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,041
She's Dr. Shepherd's patient,

516
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,041
and she's showing

517
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,417
an atypical preoperative
visual field defect.

518
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:02,125
If it turns out to be
a pituitary apoplexy,

519
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:04,041
she'll need emergency surgery
immediately.

520
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,834
Dr. Shepherd
went home sick and--

521
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,625
she what?
Amelia's sick?

522
00:20:07,667 --> 00:20:09,333
Cooper, I love you,
but go away.

523
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:13,041
And she told me to call her
if I needed her,

524
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:14,250
but she's not answering
her phone,

525
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:15,834
and I'm not sure what
the protocol is if she's not--

526
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,041
I'll find Dr. Shepherd.

527
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,375
You book an O.R.
just in case we need it.

528
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:21,166
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you.

529
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,583
So you hit it
on the cabinet?

530
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,041
I just... stood up
without looking.

531
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,291
It was stupid.
Knocked myself out.

532
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,041
Your husband called
the ambulance?

533
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,208
I guess so.

534
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,041
So where is he?

535
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,709
What's with the 20 questions,
Anderson?

536
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,208
Sorry.

537
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,083
I'm just sayin',
your bedside manner needs work.

538
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:43,000
But I learned from you.
Here, take a look.

539
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,792
There's no sign of a bleed,

540
00:20:44,834 --> 00:20:47,041
but the loss of conscious,
the pain, dizziness...

541
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,709
It's a concussion.
I got it.

542
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,000
And as you know,
rest is your best bet.

543
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,834
I don't think you need
to stay for observation

544
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,375
as long as your husband
can help you out,

545
00:20:54,417 --> 00:20:55,458
keep an eye on you.

546
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,041
Think you can rely on him
for that?

547
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,166
I'll be fine.

548
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:01,750
Can you write me something
for pain?

549
00:21:01,792 --> 00:21:02,750
Yeah, of course.

550
00:21:02,792 --> 00:21:04,333
Something strong.

551
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:05,917
Gonna need it.

552
00:21:05,959 --> 00:21:07,250
You got it.

553
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:56,041
Hey, is it
all right to come in?

554
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,041
Oh, absolutely. She's, uh,
she's already out, though.

555
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,041
That's okay.

556
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:01,917
I just want to sit with her.

557
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:08,041
So you got some eggs, huh?

558
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:10,041
Oh, yes, we did.

559
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:12,291
Four of 'em.

560
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:14,250
Wow.

561
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:18,041
That's great.

562
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:19,625
That's really great.

563
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:23,375
It's all just kinda...

564
00:22:23,417 --> 00:22:26,709
Halfway with you two,
isn't it?

565
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,041
What?

566
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:30,166
You showed up to hold her hand,
but, uh,

567
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:32,500
you waited
till she's already out.

568
00:22:32,542 --> 00:22:34,291
So she doesn't even know
you're here.

569
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:35,750
I was running late.

570
00:22:35,792 --> 00:22:37,458
Okay.

571
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,041
What are you trying
to say?

572
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:40,458
I already said it, Sam.

573
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,959
It's all halfway.

574
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,250
I mean, you're--
you're staying with her,

575
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:46,041
but you don't want to parent
with her.

576
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:48,041
It's one of the stranger plans
I've ever heard of.

577
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:49,542
I love her.
Oh, I get that.

578
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:51,041
Yeah, it's just bad timing.

579
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:52,250
I get that, too.

580
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,583
I think we can make it work.

581
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:00,208
Okay.

582
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,417
It's not halfway.

583
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:04,125
It's just...

584
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,041
It's halfway.

585
00:23:10,417 --> 00:23:12,417
I'm worried about
my marriage.

586
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:15,500
I'm worried about Amelia.

587
00:23:15,542 --> 00:23:17,291
Well, I'm not your therapist.
I'm your friend.

588
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:20,375
And that means I get to
talk about my stuff, too.

589
00:23:20,417 --> 00:23:23,041
Well, yeah, okay.
Okay, you go first.

590
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:29,375
I hardly ever hear
from her.

591
00:23:29,417 --> 00:23:31,417
Since Michelle died,
she's gone into hiding.

592
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:33,166
And i-I'm worried about her.

593
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:34,458
Worried how?

594
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,041
I'm worried about her
like I think about her

595
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:37,667
pretty much all the time,

596
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:40,291
and when I get a text message,
I will it to be from her,

597
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:42,417
and it never is, and I...

598
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:43,917
Want to check on her.

599
00:23:43,959 --> 00:23:45,959
You know, I want to check on her
about 15 times a day.

600
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,041
But I...

601
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:49,750
I don't know
who I am to her.

602
00:23:49,792 --> 00:23:51,291
I don't know
if I'm just a colleague

603
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:53,041
or a friend.

604
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:54,333
I...

605
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:56,542
I think about her all day

606
00:23:56,583 --> 00:24:00,625
and I'm pretty certain
that's not reciprocal.

607
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:03,917
All right.
Tell me about your marriage.

608
00:24:03,959 --> 00:24:06,041
Really? 'Cause I was just
gonna give you

609
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:08,500
some profound insight
on this whole Amelia thing.
I really don't want
to hear about it,

610
00:24:08,542 --> 00:24:09,875
so just--
you're
more comfortable listening.

611
00:24:09,917 --> 00:24:11,041
Is that it?
Pete, please. Can we--

612
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:12,291
o-o-okay, okay.

613
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:14,625
Uh, you know, I-I tried
to do what you told me.

614
00:24:14,667 --> 00:24:18,250
I tried to remember
all the reasons I married her.

615
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:20,250
But I'm overwhelmed
with this feeling of--

616
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:22,875
that--i-i don't know.
I-I don't trust her.

617
00:24:22,917 --> 00:24:24,041
And I don't know why.

618
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:26,000
And I don't know
how to talk to her about it

619
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:27,542
because everything
I think to say

620
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:29,041
sounds like an accusation.

621
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,750
That sucks.

622
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:35,834
Wow.
That's your insight?

623
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,417
Yeah.

624
00:24:42,542 --> 00:24:44,542
Dr. King, I have
an update on Kelly garrity.

625
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,041
The pituitary adenoma
is bleeding

626
00:24:46,083 --> 00:24:47,750
and the blood is compressing
the optical chiasm.

627
00:24:47,792 --> 00:24:49,375
Well,
how'd it start bleeding?

628
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:51,500
And how the hell
did Dr. Shepherd miss it?

629
00:24:51,542 --> 00:24:53,208
It's unpredictable. The problem
is, the nerve will die

630
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,417
if the blood compresses it
for too long.

631
00:24:54,458 --> 00:24:55,417
We have about 30 minutes

632
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:57,041
before she loses her vision
permanently.

633
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:58,417
Have you done
this surgery before?

634
00:24:58,458 --> 00:25:00,625
No, ma'am, but I have watched
several and assisted twice.

635
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:01,792
I feel confident
that given the opp--

636
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,083
shut up
and page Dr. Shepherd again,

637
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:05,542
then prep the patient,
get scrubbed, and stand by.

638
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:06,792
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you.

639
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:16,166
Hey there.

640
00:25:16,208 --> 00:25:18,208
Hey. Excuse me.

641
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,625
Anderson--
no.

642
00:25:19,667 --> 00:25:21,375
It still hurts.
Charlotte.

643
00:25:21,417 --> 00:25:22,500
It's called
post-concussion syndrome.

644
00:25:22,542 --> 00:25:23,917
Charlotte, it's been months.

645
00:25:23,959 --> 00:25:25,041
It's too long.
It's too many refills.

646
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:26,542
Please don't judge
my healing process.

647
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:27,583
I'm in pain.

648
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:29,041
I just need
some more painkillers.

649
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:30,542
It's really that simple.

650
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:32,041
Fine. I'll write you
something lighter.

651
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:33,458
Damn it, Anderson.

652
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,458
You think I don't know
what's best for me?

653
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,583
This stuff is addictive.

654
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:37,834
You think
I don't know that, too?

655
00:25:37,875 --> 00:25:39,583
Look at me. Do I look like
an addict to you?

656
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:41,041
Or do I look like a person

657
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:42,750
who's showing up for work
every day,

658
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:44,375
doing my job, despite
the staggering headaches

659
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,375
that people like you
are causing me?

660
00:25:46,417 --> 00:25:48,625
I bumped my head
again yesterday.

661
00:25:48,667 --> 00:25:50,625
Same cabinet, same spot.

662
00:25:50,667 --> 00:25:52,041
Hurt like hell.

663
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:54,333
It was stupid. I'm having
that cabinet removed this week.

664
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:56,375
Now just, please,
write the scrip for me.

665
00:25:56,417 --> 00:25:58,041
All right?

666
00:25:58,083 --> 00:26:00,709
This is the only thing
I can't do for myself.

00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,750
Please... don't die.

674
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:13,166
Please.

675
00:27:16,083 --> 00:27:17,542
Uh, patient 135

676
00:27:17,583 --> 00:27:18,959
suffered
from compulsive behavior

677
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,792
secondary to
borderline personality disorder.

678
00:27:21,834 --> 00:27:23,250
I saw her for three years,

679
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:26,583
during which time she went
from jobless, promiscuous,

680
00:27:26,625 --> 00:27:28,583
and sleeping
on her mother's sofa

681
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:30,709
to being gainfully employed,

682
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,709
abstinent from
her sexual compulsions,

683
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:35,875
and in a seemingly steady
relationship for about a year.

684
00:27:35,917 --> 00:27:37,291
Um...

685
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:39,375
I-I don't know
where she stands right now

686
00:27:39,417 --> 00:27:42,041
because we had to
abruptly end treatment.

687
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:43,792
Okay, uh, patient number--

688
00:27:43,834 --> 00:27:46,041
Violet, I have enough.

689
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:47,417
You do?

690
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:49,083
Yeah, I-I have
a veritable mountain here.

691
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,792
A bad attorney could make a case
for your reinstatement,

692
00:27:51,834 --> 00:27:53,750
and I'm not a bad attorney.
Are you sure?

693
00:27:53,792 --> 00:27:55,041
Yeah, between
the procedural mistakes

694
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:56,083
the board investigator made,

695
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:58,959
the documented burden suffered
by your abandoned patients,

696
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,041
yeah, I'm sure I have enough.

697
00:28:01,083 --> 00:28:03,625
I'm also sure the Sushi place
down the street

698
00:28:03,667 --> 00:28:06,792
has the best spicy tuna
you've ever tasted.

699
00:28:06,834 --> 00:28:08,000
Can I buy you dinner?

deep breaths

707
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,333

that you're confident.

You trained for this.

Thank you.

728
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:20,041
I gave him 15 minutes

729
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:21,834

732
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,625

So, uh, what happens
after 15 minutes?

tickle him till he laughs.

739
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,709

upset about something real,

740

00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:42,667
Uh...

884
00:35:42,709 --> 00:35:44,458
It's child abuse.

885
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,375
Not just giving him
the drugs,

886
00:35:46,417 --> 00:35:48,083
which is...

887
00:35:48,125 --> 00:35:50,041
You know, I should've called
child protective services--

888
00:35:50,083 --> 00:35:51,041
you what?

889
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:52,458
I said I should've.
I didn't,

890
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,041
because the hell Ollie
could suffer in that system

891
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:56,125
is worse than the hell he's
already suffering here.

892
00:35:56,166 --> 00:35:57,125
But...
Dr. Freedman--

893
00:35:57,166 --> 00:35:58,542
it is child abuse,

894
00:35:58,583 --> 00:36:00,041
the amount of pressure
you put on him.

895
00:36:00,083 --> 00:36:02,417
It's child abuse that he's
afraid to bring home a "b"

896
00:36:02,458 --> 00:36:04,041
in the third grade
because you're convinced

897
00:36:04,083 --> 00:36:06,041
it's gonna keep him
out of the Ivy leagues, that--

898
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:07,208
Dr. Freedman,
are you a parent?

899
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:08,917
Do you have any idea what kind
of pressure these kids--

900
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:10,750
I-I am.
I am a parent.

901
00:36:10,792 --> 00:36:13,041
And I feel...

902
00:36:14,083 --> 00:36:16,041
I look at my son,
and I want to right in advance

903
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:18,041
every wrong
that could ever come down

904
00:36:18,083 --> 00:36:20,041
and fall on him
in his entire life.

905
00:36:20,083 --> 00:36:22,041
And I can imagine that that's
what you think you're doing,

906
00:36:22,083 --> 00:36:23,709
because I believe
that you love your son.

907
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:25,041
But you know what?

908
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:28,000
People that hit their kids,
they love them, too.

909
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:30,041
And they think
that what they're doing

910
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:31,959
is for their kid's
best interest.

911
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,834
You're making him
afraid to fail.

912
00:36:33,875 --> 00:36:35,834
An 8 year old can't be
afraid to fail.

913
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:38,041
I mean, 'cause, you know,
life is...

914
00:36:38,083 --> 00:36:39,125
Full of failure.

915
00:36:39,166 --> 00:36:41,959
It's how we learn.

916
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,959
And all Ollie is learning
is that the way he is

917
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,959
is not enough
to live up to your standards.

918
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,041
That's...
That's wrong.

919
00:36:48,083 --> 00:36:49,000
It's abuse.

920
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:52,875
So here's what's gonna happen.

921
00:36:52,917 --> 00:36:55,875
You're gonna bring Ollie in
to see me every month

922
00:36:55,917 --> 00:36:57,458
for a checkup
and a blood test,

923
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,625
because I can't control
what kind of crap

924
00:36:59,667 --> 00:37:01,250
you pump into his mind,

925
00:37:01,291 --> 00:37:02,875
but if I catch you pumping
any more crap into his body,

926
00:37:02,917 --> 00:37:05,041
I'm gonna skip
child protective services,

927
00:37:05,083 --> 00:37:07,250
and I'm just gonna call
the damn police.

928
00:37:09,875 --> 00:37:13,041
Do we understand
each other?

929
00:37:13,083 --> 00:37:14,083
We do.

930
00:37:14,125 --> 00:37:15,917
All right.

931
00:37:15,959 --> 00:37:17,500
Uh...

932
00:37:17,542 --> 00:37:21,000
I will see
you and Ollie in a month.

933
00:37:28,667 --> 00:37:30,834
Amelia!

934
00:37:40,375 --> 00:37:43,041
Go away, Charlotte.

935
00:37:43,083 --> 00:37:45,709
You're taking drugs.

936
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:47,041
You're taking pills.

937
00:37:47,083 --> 00:37:49,583
That's why
you're blowing clean.

938
00:37:52,542 --> 00:37:54,083

939
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:55,542
If you don't watch out, I am
gonna hit you with a lawsuit

940
00:37:55,583 --> 00:37:57,041

Kelly garrity,

942
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:00,041

What?

944
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:03,500
Her tumor started bleeding.

945
00:38:03,542 --> 00:38:04,959
Frankly, we're lucky
she's alive,

946
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,709
'cause the resident
who had to do your surgery

947
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,041
sure as hell
coulda killed her.

948
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:09,667

you went home sick.

950
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:13,875
- You don't look sick, Amelia.
- You look high.

951
00:38:16,083 --> 00:38:17,625
Excuse me.

952
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:23,041
You want to sue me?

953
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:25,041
