00:00:06,875 --> 00:00:09,041
My mother always used to say,

3
00:00:09,083 --> 00:00:12,625
"people plan, and god laughs."

4
00:00:12,667 --> 00:00:16,041
Which is funny, because bizzy
didn't even believe in god.

5
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:18,041
Do you?

6
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:19,542
I...

7
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:22,542
I don't know.

8
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:26,125
I mean, the idea of something
bigger than me, uh, god

9
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:29,458
being in charge of my life
is somehow comforting, I guess.

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,625
But it's also unsettling.

11
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:34,875
I think, if there is a god,

12
00:00:34,917 --> 00:00:37,750
he doesn't want
to hurt us or judge us.

13
00:00:37,792 --> 00:00:41,208
Hurting and judging
are distinctly human traits.

14
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,250
It's a letter
from the medical board.

15
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:46,000
They're suspending my license.

16
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:47,750
They're coming after
the practice.

17
00:00:47,792 --> 00:00:49,625
- I met a guy.
- We'll have to tell

18
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:50,792
who we are sooner or later.

19
00:00:50,834 --> 00:00:52,417
I can't come to Fiji.
Why not?

20
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:54,000
What do you have
holding you here?

21
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:55,166
Look, I just slipped.

22
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:57,041
Starting now,
your surgical privileges

23
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:59,000
at this hospital are revoked.

24
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:00,625
If you run away again--
again?

25
00:01:00,667 --> 00:01:02,500
You dropped Lucas in my lap
and you ran!

26
00:01:02,542 --> 00:01:03,834
I'm going.

27
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:09,375
I missed you.

28
00:01:09,417 --> 00:01:10,667
I missed you too.

29
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:12,417
I'm still gonna want a baby,
Sam.

30
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:18,041
I wanna believe in a god who's--

31
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:21,667
who's like the kind of parent
I hope to be one day.

32
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:23,667
Accepting,

33
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:26,208
loving, forgiving, present.

34
00:01:27,542 --> 00:01:31,667
I mean, life's too hard
to believe in the other kind.

35
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:33,083
Don't you think?

36
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:17,792
Wow. That was, uh...

37
00:02:17,834 --> 00:02:19,041
Different.
Better.

38
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:21,542
Amazing.
That was amazing.

39
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:23,542
Why did we break up?

40
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:26,083
You really want me
to remind you?
No.

41
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:27,750
No, I don't. Ha, ha.

42
00:02:27,792 --> 00:02:29,750
Okay.

43
00:02:34,792 --> 00:02:36,000
Sam.
Mm. No, just ignore it.

44
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:37,125
Stop, stop.

45
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,041
No, Sam, it's the hospital.
I'm not on call.

46
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,166
Are you sure?
Yes.

47
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:42,458
Yeah? Oh.

48
00:02:45,792 --> 00:02:47,333
This is Dr. Bennett.

49
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,208
Okay. I'll be right there.

50
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,417
Take it off.

51
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:06,375
I'm gonna need another drink
for that.

52
00:03:06,417 --> 00:03:07,583
I can make that happen.

53
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:10,166
Bitch, get off the bar.
We're not in Vegas.

54
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:13,542
Hey. Whoa. Hey.
No need for name calling.

55
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:14,667
We can all be friends.

56
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,625
Come dance with me, sister.

57
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:20,000
Guys like
a little girl on girl.

58
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,166
See...

59
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,583
Now I see a need
for name calling...

60
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,208
Bitch.

61
00:03:35,792 --> 00:03:37,166
Son of a...

62
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,458
Y'all suck as a mosh pit.

63
00:03:45,667 --> 00:03:49,041
Attention, passengers
on flight 531 to New York,

64
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,625
we apologize
for the ongoing delay.

65
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:52,917
We're working to correct
an issue

66
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,667
with the hydraulics system

67
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:56,500
and will announce
a new departure time

68
00:03:56,542 --> 00:03:58,208
as soon as we have one.
Thank you.

69
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,375
Maybe the delay is a sign.

70
00:04:00,417 --> 00:04:02,458
No, it's not.
We made the right decision.

71
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,792
It's time to go home.

72
00:04:03,834 --> 00:04:05,208
Oh, really?

73
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,000
I don't know. I feel like

74
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,667
I should go back
to my mother's house.

75
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:10,291
- Come on, Jo.
- You don't throw away

76
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,083
12 years
of marriage over one fight.

77
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,625
Trust me.

78
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:17,500
You'll see.

79
00:04:17,542 --> 00:04:20,083
Okay? We'll...
We'll work it out

80
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,125
like we always do.

81
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:24,750
This time is different.
You know that.

82
00:04:24,792 --> 00:04:27,000
This time, I don't know
if we can fix it.

83
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,750
Damn it. Again.

84
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,875
- Sam.
- Not now.

85
00:04:38,917 --> 00:04:40,834
Sam, how long has he been down?

86
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,208
Forty-five minutes.

87
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,834
You have to call it.
No.

88
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:46,750
Sam, call it.

89
00:04:56,542 --> 00:04:58,000
Time of death...

90
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,959
Ten seventeen.

91
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:27,041
Thanks for coming in.
Duncan was on call

92
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:29,500
but he got stuck in the or
doing an aortic valve.

93
00:05:29,542 --> 00:05:31,125
No problem.
Uh, if you're good here

94
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:33,208
I was thinking about
heading back home. Hey.

95
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,583
I didn't know you were--

96
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,583
yeah. Uh, I have a mother--

97
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,542
with triplets,
went into early labor.

98
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:39,834
And they already
have twins,

99
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:41,375
so I'm going to retire

100
00:05:41,417 --> 00:05:42,542
on that family.
Hmm.

101
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:43,709
Did you deliver them yet?

102
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,041
No, no,
she hasn't dilated yet.

103
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,709
Okay,
so you're still waiting.

104
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,709
Because I was thinking,
I think I'm done for the night.

105
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,542
Yeah.
Well, good news.

106
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:55,333
Pete never showed up for his
shift, so, Sam, you can fill in.

107
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,041
You can keep Addison company
all night.

108
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,125
Okay.

109
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,792
As long as you
stop pretending

110
00:05:59,834 --> 00:06:01,583
that you two
aren't back together,

111
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,041
because you can't sell it,

112
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:04,583
and it's making me
uncomfortable.

113
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,583
Wait. What happened
to Pete now?

114
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:12,166
Oh, he's probably upset
because Violet went to New York.

115
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,667
What?

116
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:15,125
Yeah, I saw her
at the airport.

117
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,625
What were you doing
at the airport?

118
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:20,041
I was, uh,
saying goodbye to Nai.

119
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,041
Violet just left?
She didn't say anything?

120
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,750
To you. I'm sure she had
some things to say to Pete.

121
00:06:24,792 --> 00:06:26,041
Which is probably why
he's upset.

122
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,458
He could've been upset here.

123
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,041
Lord knows there are enough
people around to cheer him up.

124
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:32,041
Pete's hard to cheer up.
He can get really dark.

125
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:33,375
Maybe I should
go over there

126
00:06:33,417 --> 00:06:35,667
and see if I can get him
out for a drink.

127
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:38,041
Give him some time, take Lucas
out for ice cream or something.

128
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:39,792
Either way, have a ball.

129
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:42,500
I'll be here,
with Sam and Addison.

130
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:48,667
I need coffee.

131
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,875
Can I get you anything?
No, I'm fine.

132
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,500
God.

133
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,542
Thank you.

134
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,542
I'm sorry. I don't usually
melt down in public like this.

135
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,625
Oh, please.

136
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:29,709
Airports are like hospitals
or high school dances.

137
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,125
Somebody's crying somewhere.

138
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,709
I'm-- I'm Violet Turner.

139
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,375
Joanna Gibbs.

140
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,792
I heard you
talking to your husband.

141
00:07:41,834 --> 00:07:43,250
I'm so sorry.
I never eavesdrop.

142
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,000
What are you gonna do
in a place like this?

143
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:48,000
No, it's-- it's fine.
We're fine.

144
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,041
I'm sure.

145
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,125
And I keep telling myself
the same thing.

146
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:58,083
I wrote a book, and I'm going to
New York for this book tour,

147
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,083
but I left my son
and my husband at home.

148
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,041
And that's created
a little bit of...

149
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,542
Drama.

150
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,959
But I guess
that's what marriage is, right?

151
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,417
You fight, you work it out.

152
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,625
Rinse. Repeat.
Ha, ha.

153
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,041
Yeah,
sometimes it feels like that.

154
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,709
You just
have to remind yourself

155
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,542
it moves the relationship
forward.

156
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:21,291
Unless you're always fighting
about the same thing.

157
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:25,709
I'm a lawyer.
I work horrendous hours.

158
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,542
And David, my husband...

159
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:30,000
- He doesn't get it.
- Ahem.

160
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:33,542
No. He used to.

161
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:37,041
He's always been incredibly
supportive.

162
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:41,834
You know, most men put
their own careers first.

163
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:45,625
David held down two jobs
to pay for my law school.

164
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,750
And then he listened to me bitch
for eight years

165
00:08:48,792 --> 00:08:50,041
while I worked round-the-clock

166
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,542
trying to make partner
at the firm, heh.

167
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,000
And then when I finally did,

168
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:57,583
I think it meant as much to him
as it did to me.

169
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,458
You don't see that often
in husbands.

170
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,000
I know.

171
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,333
The problem is,

172
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:08,583
things haven't gotten
any easier at the firm,

173
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:11,500
and all of a sudden,
he's not like that.

174
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,291
I don't know.
Something in him changed.

175
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:20,250
I came out here to...

176
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,792
Get away, I guess.

177
00:09:22,834 --> 00:09:25,166
Well, sometimes distance
can give you

178
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:27,250
a little perspective
on a relationship.

179
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:28,667
Yeah.

180
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:32,125
When David flew out,
he was so apologetic.

181
00:09:33,542 --> 00:09:36,041
I know he's right.

182
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,583
In the heat of the moment,

183
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:41,041
you say or do things
you wouldn't...

184
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,834
When you say "do things"...

185
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,333
Wh--? What happened?

186
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:50,542
Last time we fought

187
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:54,792
David hit me.

188
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,333
Come on, Pete.
I know you're in there.

189
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,375
I saw your car out front.
Come on, man.

190
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:07,417
I also know that Violet

191
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:10,208
left for New York today
and that that sucks.

192
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,458
I brought some beer.

193
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,917
I thought I could come in,
and we could commiserate.

194
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:15,041
Or I could leave the beer,

195
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,250
and I'll take Lucas
out for a little bit.

196
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,542
Lucas?

197
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:22,875
Pete!

198
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,709
Look, man, I really do not
want to see your ass again,

199
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,208
but I am a little freaked out,
so I'm coming in, okay?

200
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,000
Pete, I'm coming in, okay?

201
00:10:36,917 --> 00:10:38,834
Pete. Pete.

202
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:49,125
All right.
326 las brisas. Come now.

203
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,959
Okay, stay with me, Pete.

204
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,959
No, it's his house.
His name is Pete Wilder.

205
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,959
I think it's a heart attack.
I got no pulse. I'm starting--

206
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,500
four, five, six.

207
00:10:58,542 --> 00:11:00,709
Okay, stay with me, Pete.
Ambulance is on the way.

208
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,000
Lucas?

209
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,041
Fifteen, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.

210
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,041
Lucas, come out here, buddy.

211
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,375
Twenty.

212
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,208
Lucas, I know it's scary,

213
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,792
but we're just taking care
of your dad, okay?

214
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:15,625
Hey.

215
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,333
You okay? I know it's scary,

216
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:19,500
but we're helping your dad,
okay?

217
00:11:19,542 --> 00:11:21,083
He's gonna be okay. I promise.

218
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,583
Come on, Pete. Come on, man.

219
00:11:31,834 --> 00:11:34,542
There he is,
my knight in shining armor.

220
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,458
You okay?

221
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,041
Fell down, need stitches,

222
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,959
didn't think I should drive.

223
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,542
Thank you for coming.

224
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,041
Yeah.

225
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,542
You didn't think
you should drive,

226
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:45,959
or the bartender
took your keys?

227
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,583
Tomato, tomato.

228
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:50,041
Amelia, y--
you're drunk.

229
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:52,000
Not quite.
I was on my way to being drunk

230
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:54,250
when all of the bleeding
interrupted my evening.

231
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,041
What happened to aa, huh?

232
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,041
My problem was with pills,
Sheldon, not booze.

233
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,875
Tomato, tomato.

234
00:11:59,917 --> 00:12:02,041
You tomatoed me back.
That's clever.

235
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,667
I like that. I like you.

236
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:05,834
Well, I like you too,
but I'm worried about you.

237
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:06,834
Oh, please don't be.

238
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,083
You're a drug addict
using a drug.

239
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,792
Just because
it comes in liquid form

240
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:11,375
doesn't mean
it's not a drug.

241
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:13,291
And addicts using drugs
have consequences.

242
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,291
For example, you need
stitches in your hand--

243
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:18,000
your Hopkins-trained
neurosurgeon hand.

244
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:21,291
And that-- that is a potentially
severe consequence, and i--

245
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:23,583
Amelia.

246
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,875
Relax, Sheldon. I'm not
trying to sleep with you.

247
00:12:25,917 --> 00:12:27,291
I needed you
to shut up so that

248
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:28,834
you could give me
a ride to the hospital

249
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,625
and I won't bleed to death
in the street.

250
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,041
Could you do that for me?

251
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,041
Yeah.

252
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,542
I'll lecture you more later.

253
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:45,750
I figured.

254
00:12:45,792 --> 00:12:47,750
Has he ever hit you before?

255
00:12:47,792 --> 00:12:49,000
No. Never. No.

256
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,959
His hours are getting
cut back at work.

257
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,667
Mine are getting worse,
so he's always home, stewing.

258
00:12:57,709 --> 00:12:59,458
I know it's a cliché,

259
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,750
but it really was at least
partially my fault.

260
00:13:03,792 --> 00:13:05,875
Do you really believe that?

261
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:11,375
We were supposed to go
for a run in the park...

262
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:13,917
And at the last minute, a client
wanted a conference call.

263
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,375
Not the first time
this happened.

264
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,291
But we just

265
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,750
fell into our same pattern.

266
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:21,458
He got mad.
I got defensive.

267
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,583
We ended up fighting
for so long

268
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:26,709
that I was going to miss
the call anyway,

269
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,709
So I texted my assistant
while he was talking.

270
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,750
I know it drives him crazy,
but I did it anyway.

271
00:13:34,792 --> 00:13:37,667
And he reacted...

272
00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:39,125
Badly.

273
00:13:40,917 --> 00:13:42,041
So you came out here.

274
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,125
See my mother.

275
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:47,709
And what does she have to say
about what happened?

276
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,417
She adores David.

277
00:13:51,792 --> 00:13:53,333
I couldn't bring myself
to tell her.

278
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:56,083
Do you have any good friends
in New York?

279
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,500
Great ones, actually.

280
00:13:57,542 --> 00:14:01,041
I have a group from college
and law school,

281
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,709
plus some great women
at work.

282
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,333
Have you told any of them
what happened?

283
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,000
You haven't told anyone.

284
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,834
Things like this

285
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,583
are not supposed to happen
to women like me.

286
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:26,625
- How's he doing?
- Pulse is thready.

287
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:28,625
Hasn't regained consciousness.
I'll take Lucas.

288
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:31,583
- Know how long he's been down?
- You get ahold of Violet?

289
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,000
I think she's in the air.

290
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:35,583
You give him antiarrhythmics?
We bolused him times 2.

291
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:39,041
All right, I need an EKG,
chem-20, enzymes, and a cbc.

292
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,542
He's on the monitors.
All right, give it to me.

293
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:44,041
He's having trouble breathing.
Need to control his airway.

294
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,041
- I'll intubate.
- I got the chart here.

295
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,458
All right, st elevation
in the anterior leads.

296
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,583
He's having an acute mi.
How's it coming, Coop?

297
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:53,250
- I can't visualize the cords.
- He's in v-fib.

298
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,792
All right. Almost there.
Almost there.

299
00:14:54,834 --> 00:14:56,458
Charge them to 360.

300
00:14:57,834 --> 00:14:59,458
Clear.

301
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,875
Cooper.

302
00:15:00,917 --> 00:15:02,041
You okay?
I'm all right.

303
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,375
- He's back in sinus.
- Get him to the cath lab

304
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:05,834
and open those blocked arteries.

305
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,250
- Go. Go, go, go.
- Come on. Come on. Let's go.

306
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,500
I'm okay.

307
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:13,667
This is very MacGyver of you.
Shut up.

308
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:16,709
You gonna fashion a bomb out of
nothing but your bra strap

309
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,041
and that suture kit?

310
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,291
Stop thinking about
my bra strap, Sheldon.

311
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,709
Yeah, actually, I was thinking
that the er would be

312
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,458
a more suitable place
for sutures.

313
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,542
Why don't we page Dr. Freud,

314
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,333
ask him why you talked about
my underwear?

315
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:28,959
Do you always use
sexual innuendo

316
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,625
to deflect potential conflict,
or is...

317
00:15:30,667 --> 00:15:33,250
No, not always.
Only with men.

318
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,291
Could you hold this?

319
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,041
Why aren't we in the er?

320
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:48,291
Because interns do sutures
in ers and interns suck.

321
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,041
But why else?

322
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,125
Amelia.

323
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,041
I don't want to run into
Charlotte, okay?

324
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,667
She'll start quoting
the aa big book at me

325
00:15:57,709 --> 00:15:59,041
and I am in no mood.

326
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:02,291
I see. So sexual innuendo
for men,

327
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:03,667
and with women, it's...

328
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:05,125
Avoidance.
Got it.

329
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:07,667
And you're planning to suture
your hand yourself?

330
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:09,375
Well, I was hoping
you could help.

331
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,542
I'm a shrink. I suck worse
than the interns. No.

332
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,041
In that case, yes,

333
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:21,583
I'm planning to suture
my own hand.

334
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,375
But you have to give me
the shot to numb it.

335
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:27,041
Can you handle that or is
my bra strap too distracting?

336
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,208
Oh.

337
00:16:32,667 --> 00:16:35,583
Hey.
Hey.

338
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:36,750
Where's Pete?

339
00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:40,041
They, uh, took him to, um...

340
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,709
The cath lab.

341
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,625
How's he doing?

342
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:46,834
Sam had to, uh, paddle him
to get his...

343
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:49,417
His rhythm back,
but, you know, fine.

344
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,625
How are you doing?
Are you okay?

345
00:16:51,667 --> 00:16:55,375
Uh, either Pete has
a really narrow trachea,

346
00:16:55,417 --> 00:16:59,709
or somebody handed me
the wrong size et tube

347
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,959
because I wasn't quite done
intubating him

348
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,667
when Sam yelled "clear."

349
00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:05,041
Oh.

350
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,208
And I got a little...
Oh, Coop.

351
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,625
I-- I'm just a little...
Spacey?

352
00:17:09,667 --> 00:17:11,041
Uh... yeah.
Tingly?

353
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,875
I remember my first year
residency,

354
00:17:16,917 --> 00:17:19,750
I scrubbed in on
an abdominal hysterectomy,

355
00:17:19,792 --> 00:17:22,041
and, uh, I was standing
down by the patient's knee

356
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,041
so I had to lean in
to get a better look.

357
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,583
Midway through,
her heart stopped.

358
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,375
I remember the attending

359
00:17:27,417 --> 00:17:29,458
grabbing the paddles,
calling "clear."

360
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,041
I lifted my hands up,

361
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:34,583
but my entire stomach
was still touching her legs.

362
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,041
Mommy.

363
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,375
When I got to the house

364
00:17:41,417 --> 00:17:43,917
he was under the dining room
table, hiding.

365
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:45,000
He saw?

366
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:53,792
Sweetie,
you're gonna be okay.

367
00:17:53,834 --> 00:17:56,041
We gotta figure out a way
to get in touch with Violet.

368
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,041
It's not like I didn't
want to tell somebody.

369
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:09,625
I-- I don't know how
to talk about it.

370
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:12,542
You're doing great.
Because you're a stranger.

371
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,792
But my mother, my friends--
I'd be too embarrassed.

372
00:18:15,792 --> 00:18:17,625
Everyone knows

373
00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:19,542
Joanna Gibbs, phi beta kappa,

374
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:22,041
order of the coif,
youngest partner at the firm.

375
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,834
If I tell them
what happened,

376
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:26,917
I'll just be Joanna Gibbs,
battered wife.

377
00:18:26,959 --> 00:18:28,959
Here he comes.

378
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,542
Go to the ladies' room.
What?

379
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:33,041
Go to the ladies' room.
I'll meet you there.

380
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,041
The coffee in here
smelled kind of grim

381
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,417
so I went to the terminal.

382
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:37,875
I got you a vanilla latte
in case--

383
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:39,834
I have to go to the bathroom.

384
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,000
Jo, are you all right?

385
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,041
Is she okay?

386
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,291
I don't know.

387
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,333
The vessel's tight.

388
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,583
Having runs of v-tach.

389
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,041
Lucas.

390
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,875
Having difficulty inserting
the stent.

391
00:19:07,917 --> 00:19:11,000
Lucas.
He's fine. He's with Addison.

392
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,166
Sam. Is his face...?

393
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,709
It's not good.

394
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,542
Muscle paralysis,
right side.

395
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:20,291
Either his heart was stopped
long enough

396
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,208
that he has brain damage
or there's a bleed.

397
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,834
We should page Amelia.
Let's pray this is reversible.

398
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,542
Get the neuro on call here now.

399
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,834
It should be Amelia.

400
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,583
We'll take whoever's closest.

401
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,583
The catheter dissected
his coronary artery.

402
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,625
He's bleeding into his chest.
Start compressions.

403
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:35,208
We lost his pulse.

404
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,041
We gotta get him to the or,
get him on bypass.

405
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,709
We're not gonna have time.

406
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,041
Just do it. Just do it. Go.

407
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,750
Sam, his eyes.

408
00:19:42,792 --> 00:19:45,125
There's just enough circulation
to perfuse his brain.

409
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:48,000
Don't stop.
I'm trying!

410
00:19:50,417 --> 00:19:52,041
Mm. Is that it?

411
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,542
Yep.

412
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,583
How are you? Y--? You okay?

413
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,375
Nothing will sober you up

414
00:19:58,417 --> 00:20:01,041
like repeatedly puncturing
your own flesh with sharp metal.

415
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,166
Oh, yeah.

416
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:05,041
I need a drink.
You wanna come?

417
00:20:12,834 --> 00:20:14,750
How about I take you
to a meeting instead?

418
00:20:14,792 --> 00:20:17,625
How about you stop sounding
exactly like Charlotte?

419
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,458
Are you on call?

420
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,417
Were you drinking
while you were on call?

421
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,417
God, Sheldon.
No, I'm not on call, but--

422
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,291
but they are
paging me anyway.

423
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:27,625
Amelia.

424
00:20:27,667 --> 00:20:29,250
What's going on?

425
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,083
Did Charlotte call you?

426
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,667
No, but I just got a page
from Sam.

427
00:20:33,709 --> 00:20:35,041
Why do you have Lucas?

428
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,083
You guys, what's going on?

429
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,333
Hi.

430
00:20:44,917 --> 00:20:46,500
Are you okay?

431
00:20:46,542 --> 00:20:49,041
David is not a violent man.

432
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,792
This was just a fluke.

433
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:54,083
But you left him
to go somewhere safe.

434
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:58,291
Do you have any reason
to doubt that instinct?

435
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,667
You don't understand
the relationship

436
00:21:01,709 --> 00:21:03,750
that David and I have.

437
00:21:03,792 --> 00:21:05,583
Maybe not.

438
00:21:07,792 --> 00:21:11,917
But I do know what it feels like
to be the victim of violence.

439
00:21:11,959 --> 00:21:14,875
I know how it feels when
the confidence and security

440
00:21:14,917 --> 00:21:17,542
that you thought you had
goes out the window.

441
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,834
And if you ever want
that back

442
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:24,291
that sense of control
over your own life,

443
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:28,041
you can't just not tell anyone
and pretend it didn't happen.

444
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:31,667
Nobody ever really gets
to control their life.

445
00:21:31,709 --> 00:21:33,041
You meet a guy,

446
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,542
you fall in love,

447
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:37,792
you make all these plans,
and then

448
00:21:37,834 --> 00:21:39,583
your husband's career
doesn't

449
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:42,125
work out
the way he thought it would.

450
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:46,000
He gets frustrated and angry
because who wouldn't?

451
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:51,041
I know how that sounds.

452
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:53,750
But marriage is complicated.

453
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:56,166
And you're not inside
this one.

454
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:58,667
You make sacrifices
to get through

455
00:21:58,709 --> 00:21:59,917
he hit you.
The hard times.

456
00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:01,667
That's not a sacrifice,
that's abuse.

457
00:22:01,709 --> 00:22:03,375
We have to stop.

458
00:22:03,417 --> 00:22:05,333
Because really,

459
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:07,834
what qualifies you to define
my relationship

460
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:09,000
and tell me what to do?

461
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:13,834
You seem like
a very nice person,

462
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,500
heh.

463
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,500
And I appreciate
your concern.

464
00:22:17,542 --> 00:22:19,583
I do.

465
00:22:21,542 --> 00:22:23,667
But this is just
none of your business.

466
00:22:25,959 --> 00:22:28,417
I have to-- I have to
get back to my husband.

467
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,000
Does Violet know?

468
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:35,333
She's on a plane
to New York.

469
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:37,208
I called, I e-mailed,
I texted.

470
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,542
I don't have good news.

471
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:40,417
Pete's pressure keeps
bottoming out.

472
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:43,041
Sam took him to the or
to put him on bypass.

473
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:44,250
What are you doing here?

474
00:22:45,667 --> 00:22:47,000
I got a page
that Sam needed me.

475
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:48,583
Is Pete having neuro
complications?

476
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:50,542
Slurred speech
and a facial droop.

477
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:52,208
Probably a cva.

478
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,625
Oh, god.

479
00:22:53,667 --> 00:22:55,041
Buddle's on his way.

480
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:56,750
Well, I'm here now.

481
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,333
What happened to your hand?

482
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:00,959
My hand's fine.

483
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,667
I'm gonna go talk to Sam.

484
00:23:02,709 --> 00:23:04,000
Amelia.

485
00:23:06,417 --> 00:23:07,583
What happened to her hand?

486
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:09,875
She cut it.
It needed some stitches.

487
00:23:09,917 --> 00:23:11,166
It's... it's fine.

488
00:23:14,834 --> 00:23:17,041
- What's happening?
- He's on bypass.

489
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:18,792
He's gonna need
a 4-vessel graft.

490
00:23:18,834 --> 00:23:20,417
- He may have a bleed.
- Why wait?

491
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:23,458
Dye. He had
two long sessions of cpr.

492
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,458
The high-peak pressure might

493
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,041
have ruptured
one of his vessels.

494
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:28,041
There. If I get in now,
I can clamp it.

495
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:30,709
He's already on bypass. I have
four arteries to graft first.

496
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,083
By the time you're done,

497
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:33,625
Pete'll be lucky
if he can drool.

498
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:35,917
Look, you take care
of your part, I'll do mine.

499
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:38,625
11-blade...
Prep for a left-side craniotomy.

500
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:41,041
Clear the fluoroscope.
I'm gonna need a craniotome,

501
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:43,250
- a joker, and some bone wax.
- Stop.

502
00:23:44,709 --> 00:23:47,041
Amelia, I said stop.

503
00:23:59,667 --> 00:24:01,875
You know,
we should switch seats.

504
00:24:01,917 --> 00:24:05,000
That's where I was sitting
for the Violet-Katie thing.

505
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:07,875
And?

506
00:24:07,917 --> 00:24:10,041
Well, that turned out okay,

507
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:11,875
so I should sit there again.

508
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:14,875
And this is where I was sitting
when Dell died.

509
00:24:14,917 --> 00:24:17,417
Oh, well, even more so.

510
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:19,333
I wasn't here
either of those times.

511
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:20,625
I was operating, so...

512
00:24:21,834 --> 00:24:24,583
No, okay, you can stay there,
but you and me.

513
00:24:30,792 --> 00:24:32,250
How do you think
Sam and Amelia are doing?

514
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:34,041
I think Sam and Amelia

515
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:36,041
are exactly who
I'd want in there, but...

516
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:37,583
But what?

517
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:39,917
Having everyone count on you
to save the life

518
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:41,542
of someone they love,

519
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:43,041
trying to set aside
your own feelings,

520
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:45,375
it's hard, that's all.

521
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:48,792
Hey, Lucas. You hungry?
Mm-hm.

522
00:24:48,834 --> 00:24:51,000
Yeah? Let's try to go find
something good to eat.

523
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:55,375
There we go.

524
00:24:55,417 --> 00:24:56,959
Call me if you hear anything,
okay?

525
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,959
Yeah.

526
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,500
- Any word from Violet?
- No.

527
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:05,959
But this says
her plane hasn't left.

528
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,792
I mean, she's still gotta be
at the airport, right?

529
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:11,834
Can I do anything?

530
00:25:13,166 --> 00:25:14,375
What're you doing?

531
00:25:14,417 --> 00:25:16,041
Pete's got an arterial bleed.

532
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:18,041
If I don't clamp--
buddle's ten minutes out.

533
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,583
He doesn't have ten minutes.
What's going on?

534
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:22,000
She cut her hand.

535
00:25:23,667 --> 00:25:25,583
But I'm fine.
Are you?

536
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:27,542
Charlotte, I'm fine.

537
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:29,542
You can say that--

538
00:25:29,583 --> 00:25:32,166
Whatever's going on between
you two, now is not the time.

539
00:25:32,208 --> 00:25:33,583
Amelia, can you cut?

540
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:37,041
It's my left hand.
I'm a righty.

541
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:38,291
Okay, then.

542
00:25:47,709 --> 00:25:51,041
I know this has been
a scary night.

543
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:53,375
And there's so many things
that have happened

544
00:25:53,417 --> 00:25:54,834
that you shouldn't have...

545
00:25:54,875 --> 00:25:57,250
Had to see. It's not fair.

546
00:25:59,417 --> 00:26:02,291
But you have your juice now.

547
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:05,917
So hopefully,
that's all that matters, huh?

548
00:26:05,959 --> 00:26:07,667
So your daddy's gonna be okay.

549
00:26:07,709 --> 00:26:11,041
He's got great doctors
working with him.

550
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:13,709
I think he's gonna be okay.

551
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:17,250
And your mommy is gonna be here
very soon, so that's good.

552
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:18,500
Right?

553
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,500
But you know what?

554
00:26:21,542 --> 00:26:23,583
Right now

555
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:25,959
I'm glad
that I'm here with you.

556
00:26:36,583 --> 00:26:39,709
Attention passengers
on flight 531 to New York.

557
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,959
The mechanical problem
has been resolved.

558
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,083
You should proceed
back to your gate.

559
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:46,250
Boarding will begin
in 15 minutes.

560
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:48,625
Thank you.

561
00:26:48,667 --> 00:26:50,875
Okay, you're right.
You did not ask my opinion,

562
00:26:50,917 --> 00:26:53,041
this is not my business,
but just-- don't do this.

563
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:54,500
Don't get on the plane.
What?

564
00:26:54,542 --> 00:26:56,709
I do know what it's like
to be in a complicated marriage,

565
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,250
but what's going on
is another thing.

566
00:26:58,291 --> 00:26:59,667
Jo, why is she--?

567
00:26:59,709 --> 00:27:02,333
And you're not ready to go home.
This is ridiculous.

568
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:04,500
If you can't talk to your mom
or friends, talk to me,

569
00:27:04,542 --> 00:27:06,041
but don't go.

570
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:08,041
Okay, we're done here.
We're done. Come on.

571
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:09,709
Excuse me,
are you Dr. Violet Turner?

572
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:12,000
I have an emergency call for you
from Dr. Freedman.

573
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:15,500
Coop?

574
00:27:18,083 --> 00:27:20,000
Oh, god.

575
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:24,792
Violet?

576
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:30,000
Full belly.

577
00:27:30,041 --> 00:27:31,959
That's good.

578
00:27:38,083 --> 00:27:40,625
I know he's scared,

579
00:27:40,667 --> 00:27:43,417
but he can't really understand
what's going on, can he?

580
00:27:43,458 --> 00:27:46,750
Well,
it's hard to tell.

581
00:27:46,792 --> 00:27:48,333
Kids absorb a lot.

582
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,625
And even if he doesn't realize
what's happening around him,

583
00:27:50,667 --> 00:27:52,667
Lucas feels the crisis.

584
00:27:54,667 --> 00:27:56,000
What'll it do to him?

585
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,917
Well, usually,
there's some regression

586
00:27:58,959 --> 00:28:01,500
in eating and toileting,

587
00:28:01,542 --> 00:28:03,375
and periods
where he can't be consoled.

588
00:28:03,417 --> 00:28:05,375
Is there anything else
that we should be doing?

589
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:07,375
We're doing it.
You're doing it.

590
00:28:07,417 --> 00:28:09,375
He needs to be around
familiar people,

591
00:28:09,417 --> 00:28:11,667
places and smells.

592
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:17,000
More than anything,
right now he... he needs Violet.

593
00:28:20,625 --> 00:28:23,625
What if Pete doesn't make it?
I mean...

594
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:28,625
It's a cataclysmic event
for a child.

595
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:31,458
One that we shouldn't even think
about unless we need to.

596
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:36,041
I didn't have a choice, did I?

597
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:38,458
I mean, Amelia was there.
It couldn't wait.

598
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,250
You did not have a choice.

599
00:28:41,291 --> 00:28:42,458
And, you know, hopefully,

600
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,250
if she had any doubt
that she could do it,

601
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:45,917
she wouldn't have
pushed so hard.

602
00:28:45,959 --> 00:28:48,792
Amelia never has any doubts.
That's what I'm worried about.

603
00:28:48,834 --> 00:28:51,709
But it's Pete.
You did not have a choice.

604
00:28:54,542 --> 00:28:57,041
What if one of us died?

605
00:28:57,083 --> 00:28:59,041
Are you seriously asking me
this right now?

606
00:28:59,083 --> 00:29:02,041
When I was 14 and my dad
had that heart attack,

607
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:04,667
it scared the hell out of me.
But the worst part

608
00:29:06,083 --> 00:29:08,500
was I remember being
in the hospital with my mom,

609
00:29:08,542 --> 00:29:09,583
and she kept saying--

610
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:12,917
not even to me,
she just kept repeating,

611
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,917
"I don't want
to be without him.

612
00:29:14,959 --> 00:29:16,458
I can't be without him."

613
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,542
And I just...

614
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:22,417
Haven't you ever
thought about it?

615
00:29:22,458 --> 00:29:24,041
Ever? Yes.

616
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:28,417
But at this moment it's not you
and me I'm worried about.

617
00:29:28,458 --> 00:29:31,500
Would you
get married again?

618
00:29:31,542 --> 00:29:33,750
Would you
not want me to?

619
00:29:33,792 --> 00:29:36,500
I don't know. I guess...

620
00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:40,041
I mean, I'd want you to be
happy, so...

621
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:41,208
You could get married again.

622
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:43,667
What about me?

623
00:29:43,709 --> 00:29:44,709
I'd want you
to be miserable

624
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,917
every day
for the rest of your life.

625
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:50,500
You asked.

626
00:29:50,542 --> 00:29:52,291
Hello.

627
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,792
Hey, Violet.
Whose phone is this?

628
00:29:55,834 --> 00:29:59,542
No, okay,
he's still in surgery.

629
00:29:59,583 --> 00:30:04,458
I will check myself right now,
okay? I'm checking.

630
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,083
Okay, he's ready to come off
pump. You done yet?

631
00:30:07,125 --> 00:30:08,750
Almost there.

632
00:30:08,792 --> 00:30:10,667
I gotta get him off
this pump now, Amelia.

633
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:13,542
The vessel's done,
but I still gotta close.

634
00:30:13,583 --> 00:30:15,500
- Just take him off.
- Okay.

635
00:30:15,542 --> 00:30:18,041
Arterial off.

636
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:21,041
Venous off.

637
00:30:31,542 --> 00:30:32,792
Okay.

638
00:30:32,834 --> 00:30:35,250
We got him back.
All right. Got him back.

639
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,000
Hey, guys. How's...?

640
00:30:39,417 --> 00:30:40,750
Lost his pressure again.

641
00:30:40,792 --> 00:30:42,709
- All right, he's in v-fib.
- Damn it.

642
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,917
Cooper, I need you to scrub in.

643
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:50,041
Pete's still in the or.
Cooper's checking on him.

644
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:51,750
I'm not gonna wait on Cooper.

645
00:30:51,792 --> 00:30:52,917
Hey, is he--?

646
00:30:52,959 --> 00:30:56,500
- He's fine, Violet. Go.
- Okay.

647
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:02,458
I'm not getting anything.

648
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,750
- What can I do?
- All right, charge again.

649
00:31:06,166 --> 00:31:07,792
- It's not working.
- Sam.

650
00:31:07,834 --> 00:31:09,750
Come here. Squeeze.

651
00:31:09,792 --> 00:31:12,792
Give me five cc's of epi,
one to 1,000.

652
00:31:12,834 --> 00:31:14,792
Come on. Don't be gentle.
Squeeze.

653
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:19,959
Violet.

654
00:31:34,709 --> 00:31:36,250
He's been in and out of
consciousness,

655
00:31:36,291 --> 00:31:37,792
but the grafts are holding.

656
00:31:37,834 --> 00:31:40,000
His cardiac output
is on target--

657
00:31:40,041 --> 00:31:42,041
and he's gonna be okay?

658
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:44,041
Yeah.

659
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:45,834
He's gonna be okay.

660
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:57,625
Recovery's gonna be tough,
but you know that.

661
00:31:57,667 --> 00:31:59,458
And in a couple of weeks,

662
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:03,083
when you get around to making
those thank-you baskets,

663
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:05,041
Sam only saved his life once.

664
00:32:05,083 --> 00:32:06,208
I saved it twice.

665
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:08,667
This is true.
Yep.

666
00:32:08,709 --> 00:32:10,875
Thank you. Both of you.
Mm-hm.

667
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:16,500
Ugh. What am I supposed to say
to him now, "I'm sorry"?

668
00:32:16,542 --> 00:32:19,709
It sounds so pathetic,
but I do want to apologize--

669
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,333
for what?

670
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:22,750
If I hadn't argued with him,
then left--

671
00:32:22,792 --> 00:32:24,083
oh, come on.

672
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:25,667
You did not cause this.

673
00:32:25,709 --> 00:32:28,458
Violet, you couldn't have
done anything to stop it.

674
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,875
It was bad luck.

675
00:32:29,917 --> 00:32:31,625
Yeah, go see him.
You'll feel better.

676
00:32:31,667 --> 00:32:33,041
Yeah.

677
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:39,500
Oh, don't be worried if he seems
a little, uh, euphoric.

678
00:32:39,542 --> 00:32:41,750
His hormones are still
a little bit scrambled

679
00:32:41,792 --> 00:32:43,667
from anesthesia and bypass.
Wait a minute.

680
00:32:43,709 --> 00:32:45,667
So you're saying Pete's
in there acting like Mr. Rogers,

681
00:32:45,709 --> 00:32:47,333
but with a zipper scar?
Ooh.

682
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:49,000
It'll wear off.

683
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:51,583
You better get in there.

684
00:33:18,458 --> 00:33:19,583
Hey.

685
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:25,041
Oh, my god.

686
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:27,000
Oh, you are beautiful.

687
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,041
Oh, and my chest hurts.

688
00:33:34,083 --> 00:33:35,959
Mm.

689
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,709
You had a heart attack.

690
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,917
Sam did a quadruple bypass.

691
00:33:40,959 --> 00:33:43,333
Then you had a brain bleed,
so Amelia had to get in there.

692
00:33:43,375 --> 00:33:44,959
Oh, that explains
the headache.

693
00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:52,041
Ah.

694
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:57,458
You know what? I know it sounds
odd, but honestly...

695
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,041
I think I'm okay.

696
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:01,333
Yeah, i--
I think that I can get up now.

697
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:03,625
Okay, okay. Maybe tomorrow.
Maybe tomorrow--

698
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:06,041
oh, okay, okay, okay.
Ha, ha.

699
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:09,041
Oh. Oh.

700
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:10,583
Huh.

701
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:12,041
I love you.

702
00:34:16,709 --> 00:34:18,625
What's wrong?

703
00:34:18,667 --> 00:34:21,041
Nothing.

704
00:34:21,083 --> 00:34:24,041
Nothing. Nothing's wrong.

705
00:34:24,083 --> 00:34:26,750
You're okay, and I'm here,
and...

706
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:30,625
We fought.

707
00:34:31,959 --> 00:34:33,625
And then I left...

708
00:34:33,667 --> 00:34:35,166
Again.

709
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:37,667
And it felt like I was going

710
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:40,500
to something this time,
not just away,

711
00:34:40,542 --> 00:34:42,458
but I know it probably didn't
feel that way to you.

712
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,750
And then Lucas...

713
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:49,625
If I hadn't gone, maybe none
of this would've happened.

714
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:51,709
Violet, stop.

715
00:34:53,083 --> 00:34:54,041
I'm okay.

716
00:34:55,458 --> 00:34:57,125
You're okay,
and Lucas is okay,

717
00:34:57,166 --> 00:34:58,792
and that's all that matters,
right?

718
00:35:00,792 --> 00:35:03,667
Hmm. You are so beautiful.

719
00:35:09,959 --> 00:35:12,625
Hey.

720
00:35:12,667 --> 00:35:13,583
Hey yourself.

721
00:35:14,709 --> 00:35:16,834
So good about Pete, right?

722
00:35:16,875 --> 00:35:19,041
You know, heart's better,
head's fine.

723
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:21,041
I mean, that leak turned
out to be pretty large,

724
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:22,625
but I clipped it.

725
00:35:22,667 --> 00:35:26,667
Rocked it is actually
what I did.

726
00:35:26,709 --> 00:35:28,583
Hey, uh...

727
00:35:28,625 --> 00:35:30,792
Thanks for, you know,

728
00:35:30,834 --> 00:35:32,500
saying that you were worried
about my hand.

729
00:35:32,542 --> 00:35:34,500
I appreciate that.

730
00:35:34,542 --> 00:35:36,291
You're not welcome, Amelia.

731
00:35:38,834 --> 00:35:40,583
Okay.

732
00:35:40,625 --> 00:35:41,959
What I mean by that is,

733
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,959
I will not enable you, and I
will not protect you anymore,

734
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,750
not ever again.

735
00:35:46,792 --> 00:35:48,166
It's a onetime deal.

736
00:35:48,208 --> 00:35:50,250
Until you get your
sobriety in hand--

737
00:35:50,291 --> 00:35:51,667
look, I am not a drunk.

738
00:35:51,709 --> 00:35:53,041
Charlotte,
I have never been a drunk.

739
00:35:53,083 --> 00:35:55,041
The fact that you're trying
to draw a distinction

740
00:35:55,083 --> 00:35:57,166
between booze and drugs
tells me you're in trouble.

741
00:35:57,208 --> 00:35:58,667
Because you know better.

742
00:35:58,709 --> 00:36:01,208
And you been around long enough
to see how this goes.

743
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:03,625
Alcoholics go out on pills,
they go crazy.

744
00:36:03,667 --> 00:36:05,125
Addicts go out on booze,

745
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:07,375
and they think they can
handle it, but they can't.

746
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:09,041
I am fine.
No, you're not.

747
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,333
The fact is, Amelia,

748
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:12,792
I care about you too much
to trust you right now.

749
00:36:12,834 --> 00:36:14,750
Your privileges
are still suspended.

750
00:36:14,792 --> 00:36:17,583
Next time someone pages you,
don't answer.

751
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:27,333
Okay, I swear to god,
if you start right now--

752
00:36:27,375 --> 00:36:29,542
I was just gonna offer you
a ride home.

753
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:33,542
I'd appreciate that.

754
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:54,166
What's wrong?
I'm mad at you.

755
00:36:54,208 --> 00:36:57,125
I couldn't be mad last night,
but now Pete's stable,

756
00:36:57,166 --> 00:37:00,250
now you've seen him,
so now I can be mad, and I am...

757
00:37:00,291 --> 00:37:01,542
Really mad.

758
00:37:01,583 --> 00:37:03,250
About what?
About you just picking up

759
00:37:03,291 --> 00:37:06,041
and leaving your husband
and your problems.

760
00:37:06,083 --> 00:37:08,709
It almost killed me
the last time you did it,

761
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,291
and you just did it again.

762
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:15,041
You're right.

763
00:37:15,083 --> 00:37:17,500
Okay, you do not get
to deal with losing your license

764
00:37:17,542 --> 00:37:18,792
by just getting on an airplane.

765
00:37:18,834 --> 00:37:20,625
And you can't
end an argument with Pete

766
00:37:20,667 --> 00:37:22,083
by just leaving town.
You're right.

767
00:37:22,125 --> 00:37:24,375
This is your life.
Stick around and fight for it.

768
00:37:24,417 --> 00:37:27,000
Wait, Cooper.
I said you're right.

769
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:31,000
And you need to get a new cell
phone with a better battery.

770
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:33,500
Hey.
Hey.

771
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:37,709
There's mama.
Oh. Hi, buddy.

772
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:40,291
Oh, I missed you so much.

773
00:37:40,333 --> 00:37:42,625
It has been a crazy night.

774
00:37:43,792 --> 00:37:45,709
He's been mostly sleeping,
but he did eat.

775
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:48,667
I mean, just cookies,
which I know isn't great, but--

776
00:37:48,709 --> 00:37:51,041
oh, it's fine.

777
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:52,583
Thank you, Addison.

778
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,125
All right.
You ready to go home?

779
00:37:57,166 --> 00:37:59,333
- Mm-hm.
- Just you and me?

780
00:37:59,375 --> 00:38:01,291
Turns out I'm not going away
after all.

781
00:38:03,083 --> 00:38:04,333
Uh-oh.

782
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,250
Hello.

783
00:38:07,291 --> 00:38:08,959
Hey.

784
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,417
Joanna, you're still here.

785
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:15,000
No. No, no, no.
I really want to talk to you.

786
00:38:26,625 --> 00:38:28,166
Life is hard.

787
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:34,917
It's hard and scary
and out of my control,

788
00:38:34,959 --> 00:38:36,583
and that part makes me
craziest--

789
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:39,041
the fact that I cannot control
the world

790
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:42,458
or what happens to the people
I love.

791
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,542
You know,
and the idea of me

792
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:48,375
having a kid, not being able
to control what happens...

793
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:54,750
Yeah, but every day
I deliver a baby.

794
00:38:54,792 --> 00:38:58,709
And every day I see
that moment of change.

795
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,417
You know,
that moment when every cell

796
00:39:00,458 --> 00:39:02,583
in a woman's body
is transformed.

797
00:39:02,625 --> 00:39:05,208
And whatever happens, whether
the baby is sick or healthy,

798
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:08,792
happy or unhappy, lives or dies,
whatever happens

799
00:39:10,375 --> 00:39:14,542
That woman will never be
just a woman again.

800
00:39:14,583 --> 00:39:18,041
She will always be a mother.

801
00:39:19,375 --> 00:39:21,208
She's transformed.

802
00:39:22,458 --> 00:39:27,625
And it's exhilarating
and terrifying and...

803
00:39:27,667 --> 00:39:29,250
I want that.

804
00:39:31,041 --> 00:39:32,834
I want it.

805
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:40,792
Sam hasn't changed his mind,
though.

806
00:39:40,834 --> 00:39:43,417
As much as I want it,
he doesn't want it.

807
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:47,250
But for today...

808
00:39:48,792 --> 00:39:51,375
For some reason, that's okay.

809
00:39:53,709 --> 00:39:57,667
Because I made an appointment
with a fertility specialist

810
00:39:57,709 --> 00:40:00,875
who is supposed to be amazing,
and...

811
00:40:02,458 --> 00:40:04,250
I went.

812
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:08,834
There's just one thing
that's weird

813
00:40:08,875 --> 00:40:12,959
and potentially complicated.

814
00:40:15,709 --> 00:40:18,667
People plan, and god laughs.

815
00:40:23,083 --> 00:40:25,083
Hello.
Ahem.

816
00:40:25,125 --> 00:40:26,834
Hello.

817
00:40:29,959 --> 00:40:31,375
You?

818
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,542
Well.

819
00:40:34,583 --> 00:40:36,542
Uh, this is a--
a nice surprise.

820
00:40:37,875 --> 00:40:40,750
I-- i'm, uh, I'm sorry.
I-- I had no idea.

821
00:40:40,792 --> 00:40:42,417
Well,
it was your choice to skip

822
00:40:42,458 --> 00:40:44,041
the preliminary consultation
in my office.

823
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:46,125
Everyone kept saying,
"fertility, Jake Reilly"

824
00:40:46,166 --> 00:40:48,875
like there was no other choice.
Well, that's flattering.

825
00:40:48,917 --> 00:40:50,834
But Jake Reilly is you?

826
00:40:50,875 --> 00:40:52,750
And you are...

827
00:40:53,583 --> 00:40:55,500
Addison Montgomery.

828
00:40:55,542 --> 00:40:58,709
Well, it's nice to meet you,
Addison, officially.

829
00:40:59,709 --> 00:41:02,750
Yeah. Um...

830
00:41:02,792 --> 00:41:07,166
I, uh... shouldn't you be
in Fiji or something?

831
00:41:07,208 --> 00:41:10,709
Well, i-- I was on the plane.
I got paged.

832
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,375
Turns out another
fertility genius

833
00:41:12,417 --> 00:41:16,083
had loaded up a patient with hcg
and nearly ruptured her ovaries.

834
00:41:16,125 --> 00:41:17,500
So I spent the night
in the hospital.

835
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:19,500
I'm here to watch her
for the next few days.

836
00:41:19,542 --> 00:41:23,166
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

837
00:41:23,208 --> 00:41:25,458
Yeah, it would've been
a great trip,

838
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,083
but, uh, you know,
sometimes you have

839
00:41:27,125 --> 00:41:29,000
more important things to do.

840
00:41:29,041 --> 00:41:31,041
I figured that was
the decision you made,

841
00:41:31,083 --> 00:41:33,458
and, uh, looks like I'm right.

842
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,291
Oh, no, no. Me being here?

843
00:41:35,333 --> 00:41:37,834
No, this has nothing to do with
why I didn't get on the plane.

844
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:38,917
Anyway, listen, the, uh,

845
00:41:38,959 --> 00:41:40,625
flirtation that we had,
that was fun.

846
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:42,583
I enjoyed that
probably as much as you did,

847
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:44,625
but, uh, I have no problem
leaving that in the past

848
00:41:44,667 --> 00:41:46,583
and simply taking care
of you as a patient--

849
00:41:46,625 --> 00:41:48,709
I don't think you understand.
Doesn't have to be awkward.

850
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:51,792
I have a boyfriend.
Will we be using his sperm?

851
00:41:53,083 --> 00:41:56,041
No, we will not
be using his sperm.

852
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:57,500
We won't be using
anyone's sperm.

853
00:41:57,542 --> 00:41:59,041
That's gonna make this hard.

854
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:01,917
We are not gonna
be doing anything.

855
00:42:01,959 --> 00:42:03,542
All right. Just--
just take a breath.

856
00:42:05,583 --> 00:42:09,125
It's okay.
Trust me, all right?

857
00:42:09,166 --> 00:42:10,834
I'm gonna give you a baby.

858
00:42:14,667 --> 00:42:16,625
So how do I deal with that?
