♪ Ohhh ohhh ohhh ♪

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,166
The last time I lived
with a man? Uh...

3
00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:13,041
It was with Derek
in a trailer in the woods.

4
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:18,917
Way deep in the woods,
like with woodland creatures.

5
00:00:18,959 --> 00:00:20,125
Okay?

6
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:22,041
The shower was about
the size of a toilet,

7
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,333
and I got poison Ivy on my...

8
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:28,667
Yeah, I got poison Ivy.

9
00:00:28,709 --> 00:00:32,792
Yeah,
it was a failed experiment

10
00:00:32,834 --> 00:00:34,250
in pushing my own boundaries.

11
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:44,000
But in some ways,
I'm proud of that chapter.

12
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:47,417
I fought for love.

13
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:51,041
I got poison Ivy on...

14
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:54,041
You know, I lost.

15
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:56,291
But I really fought.

16
00:00:56,333 --> 00:01:00,333
Are you afraid now
to lose again?

17
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:07,000
Wow.
Oh, that's good stuff.

18
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:10,041
Oh, that's good stuff.

19
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:12,041
I like living together.

20
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:14,291
I like it too.

21
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:17,041
All right. Come here.

22
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:20,834
No, Sam.
We have to go to work now.

23
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:22,458
Come on.
I'm the boss now.

24
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,000
No, you ain't the boss of me.

25
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:26,875
You...
I am too.

26
00:01:26,917 --> 00:01:29,041
I'm the boss. Now.

27
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:30,417
Wait. M-- okay.
Come on.

28
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:31,917
We have a business to run.

29
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,041
Where you going?

30
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:35,041
Sam. Aah!

31
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:38,041
I have to go to work.

32
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:39,500
Mm-mm.
Mm.

33
00:01:39,542 --> 00:01:40,709
Mm-mm.

34
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:44,625
What are you doing?

35
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:47,041
You are not the boss in here.

36
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:49,041
Oh. Okay.

37
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:51,291
I like...

38
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:54,208
I like not being
the boss in here.

39
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:04,083
Huh. Looks like Amelia's

40
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:05,625
housewarming party's
finally over.

41
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:06,792
Mm-hm.

42
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:13,041
Oh. Ha-ha-ha. Sam.

43
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,750
Tell us why you'd like to work
for oceanside wellness group.

44
00:02:23,792 --> 00:02:25,250
I saw the posting,
and to be frank,

45
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,125
I'm surprised to see
you guys are still open,

46
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:30,166
you know, given all the bad
press with the medical board.

47
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:33,458
Well, those accusations have
been somewhat exaggerated.

48
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,834
Somewhat?

49
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,917
Either they're investigating
you or they're not.

50
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,917
Okay, well, would you consider
yourself a team player?

51
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,041
Team player?

52
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:44,917
I'm not a big fan of sports,
if that's what you're asking.

53
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,041
Can you tell us why you
decided to become a doctor?

54
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,166
Well, back then,
we called it a career path.

55
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:52,750
Lawyer, doctor, or dentist.

56
00:02:52,792 --> 00:02:55,083
Who wants to have their hands
in someone's mouth?

57
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,917
Your resume is a bit
confusing.

58
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,709
What year did you graduate
medical school?

59
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,709
2006.
Fast-tracked it in 3.

60
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,041
My endocrinology residency,
did it in four.

61
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,375
This is really good coffee.

62
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:06,542
Do you make this
in-house or send out?

63
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,125
Uh, that's in-house.

64
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,250
That's good. That's a perk.
I like perks.

65
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:11,750
What's the parking sitch?

66
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:14,000
I hate dings.

67
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,667
Anyone here golf?
We'll be in touch.

68
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:19,041
Thanks for coming in.

69
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,125
We'll get back to you.

70
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,125
They can't all be that bad.

71
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,542
You wouldn't think so.

72
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,041
One asked if he could
bring his cat.

73
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:28,041
He sounds like a keeper.

74
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,250
I feel optimistic.

75
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,041
We've got a lot more people
to interview.

76
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,041
We'll find someone.

77
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,041
Morning, beautiful people.
Look who's here.

78
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,333
Well, isn't this
a nice surprise?

79
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:37,959
You're looking well.
Feeling well.

80
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,250
I'm ready to work.

81
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:40,792
Uh, no caffeine.
Stick with decaf.

82
00:03:40,834 --> 00:03:42,417
We agreed it was
a little early.

83
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:43,500
What can I say?

84
00:03:43,542 --> 00:03:45,208
I am sick
of daytime television.

85
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,709
Quadruple bypass
is no joke, Pete.

86
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,917
You sound
just like Violet.

87
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:50,458
She's right.
Thank you.

88
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,041
Well, maybe
you give it another week.

89
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,250
I'll ease into it.

90
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:54,875
Uh, okay.
Well, as long as

91
00:03:54,917 --> 00:03:56,917
you stick to the agreed-upon
rehab protocol.

92
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,875
You know, that graft site
is still healing.

93
00:03:58,917 --> 00:04:01,041
You don't want to
stress the suture line.

94
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,458
Just don't overexert yourself.

95
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,000
Got it? Okay.
Got it.

96
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:07,041
Are you already interviewing
for Naomi's job?

97
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,041
Oh, well, empty office
doesn't bring money in.

98
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,166
Don't worry.
We haven't found anybody yet.

99
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:12,500
No, no, it's not that.

100
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:14,458
I just thought maybe I could
help with the hiring.

101
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,959
I know I'm not
seeing patients yet,

102
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,041
but if you need somebody
to vet the resumes

103
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,083
or do a psych breakdown
or...

104
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,542
Lucas is with the babysitter,

105
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,625
and I'd kind of rather
be here than at home.

106
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:25,041
I don't have a problem.

107
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:27,125
You've been suspended
from seeing patients,

108
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,500
doesn't mean
you can't help out.

109
00:04:28,542 --> 00:04:31,125
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.

110
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,750
Great.
Great.

111
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:48,041
You're late, Dr. Freedman.

112
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:49,792
Try sneaking
a 32-inch television

113
00:04:49,834 --> 00:04:51,792
past the nurses' station.

114
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:53,458
Popcorn is for later.

115
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,875
What are we watching?

116
00:04:54,917 --> 00:04:57,041
No, wait. Let me guess.
Uh, the little mermaid.

117
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:58,375
We watched that already.

118
00:04:58,417 --> 00:05:00,041
Cartoons was last month's
theme.

119
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,291
This month,
it's all about the musical.

120
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,583
Right?
So tonight's feature...

121
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,041
You can tell them.

122
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:09,291
Oliver! It's a musical
with real live people.

123
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,709
And starving orphans.
It's very uplifting.

124
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,083
Dr. Freedman,
here are the labs.

125
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,166
Thank you.

126
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,750
I am going to talk
to your folks outside, okay?

127
00:05:20,792 --> 00:05:23,333
Do not eat my popcorn.

128
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,041
These are the results
from kerri's last blood smear.

129
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,041
It's not good, is it?
I knew it.

130
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,291
There's no weight gain.
Her face is still so pale.

131
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,709
Let him speak.

132
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,208
Her leukemia's back.

133
00:05:40,542 --> 00:05:44,583
But you said my bone marrow
was a good match.

134
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,500
It is. Um...

135
00:05:46,542 --> 00:05:48,875
Sometimes a good match
just doesn't work.

136
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,291
Okay.

137
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,041
So, what are our options?

138
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,625
There's only one.
It's a cord blood transfusion,

139
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:58,000
and quickly.

140
00:06:00,667 --> 00:06:03,250
When kerri was born, we...

141
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:04,625
Money was tight.

142
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:07,000
We weren't sure
we'd ever need it.

143
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,041
That wouldn't help. The genetic
marker for leukemia

144
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,000
is already in kerri's blood,

145
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,458
so we need the cord blood

146
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,000
from another child
who's a match.

147
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,875
Where do we get it?
Most hospitals,

148
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,041
including St. ambrose,

149
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,792
have a cord blood donor bank.
We'll start looking.

150
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:26,041
You two certainly
started your day off right.

151
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,417
And that's my cue to leave.

152
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:28,917
Ha, ha. Here.

153
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:30,083
Yeah, I got it.
See you.

154
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,709
He does know
I'm a grown-up, right?

155
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:35,709
We're just not used to having
neighbors with noises.

156
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,375
Noisy neighbors
who have parties at--

157
00:06:38,417 --> 00:06:40,000
when did I become
the nosy landlady?

158
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:42,375
Scary.
But it is still your place,

159
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:44,417
and that party was
just a little housewarming.

160
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,208
Not gonna be
a weekly occurrence.

161
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,250
Just be careful, you know,
with all the partying.

162
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,291
I'm not drinking,
if that is what you're asking.

163
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,041
Not a drop.
Mm-hm.

164
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,041
I was the happy,
sober hostess last night.

165
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,291
Scout's honor.

166
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,917
I believe you.
And what about that guy?

167
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,542
Javier?
Mm-hm.

168
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:01,667
He's a painter.

169
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:03,542
Ooh, an artist.
That's sexy.

170
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:06,709
He does houses, but you
should see his six-pack.

171
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,959
Javier.

172
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:11,250
Computer won't go any faster
with you hovering, Coop.

173
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,709
Making sure you have
kerri's information right.

174
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,208
I do, and if there's
a cord blood match,

175
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,959
we'll know in a second.

176
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,667
Search again.

177
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:22,291
Cooper--
somewhere in this country,

178
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,041
there's gotta be a match
for this girl.

179
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,041
Move over.
Let me search.

180
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:27,041
I've checked
the public donor banks.

181
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,667
I'm sorry,
but there's no match.

182
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:33,041
Check the private ones.

183
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,041
Come on, Charlotte.
You're chief of staff.

184
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,667
You have the authorization
to do it.

185
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:38,500
That cord blood
isn't for the public.

186
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:40,166
Families are saving it
in case they need it.

187
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:42,041
99% of cord blood
never gets used.

188
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,375
It just goes to waste.
And what about kerri?

189
00:07:44,417 --> 00:07:46,166
She will die without
this blood transfusion.

190
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:47,542
She's special to you.

191
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,875
But there are
a thousand kerris out there

192
00:07:49,917 --> 00:07:51,041
who want me
to break the rules.

193
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,834
I can't do that.

194
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,709
We have a cooperative
practice.

195
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,166
Nothing wrong
with a little cooperation.

196
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,667
So that would work for you?

197
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:03,000
I can make anything work
with the right people.

198
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:06,000
Okay, then.
Thank you for coming in.

199
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:08,458
You have our number.

200
00:08:09,792 --> 00:08:10,750
Who's next?

201
00:08:10,792 --> 00:08:12,041
Dr. Jake Reilly.

202
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:15,417
Jake Reilly, md.

203
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:18,208
You know what? I think i'm
gonna, uh, sit this one out.

204
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,291
Why? This guy
actually sounds pretty great.

205
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,542
Duke medical school,
time at Johns Hopkins.

206
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:23,959
Double board-certified

207
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,041
with a fellowship in
reproductive endocrinology.

208
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,500
I have a lot of work.
You guys can finish up. Huh?

209
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:29,917
No, no, no.
He's already here.

210
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:32,166
Let's just get this over with.
Sit down. Sit down.

211
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,875
Thank you.

212
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,458
Have we met before?

213
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,125
We absolutely have met before.

214
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,875
Um...

215
00:08:48,917 --> 00:08:50,417
I got it.
Intramural basketball.

216
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,750
Intramural hoops.
Yes, exactly.

217
00:08:52,792 --> 00:08:54,458
Wow.

218
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,041
A long time.
You know each other?

219
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:59,250
Yeah, uh,
undergrad at Georgetown.

220
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:01,208
You guys used to kick
our asses all the time.

221
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,041
- We did. I'm sorry about that.
- Ha-ha-ha.

222
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,041
I played field hockey
at Emerson.

223
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,125
Well, all right.

224
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,166
So, uh, it says here
that you

225
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:17,417
are double board-certified
in general surgery and ob-gyn.

226
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:20,500
They're fairly divergent
disciplines.

227
00:09:20,542 --> 00:09:23,208
What,
you just couldn't choose?

228
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,041
- Addison--
- Not at all.

229
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,709
Surgery is the hardest
of the specialties

230
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,041
in terms of pure skill.

231
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:30,041
I'm sure as a fellow surgeon,
you would agree.

232
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,458
But obstetrics, it's all about
caring for the patient.

233
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,208
And fertility in particular,
it, uh...

234
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,667
It requires
a hands-on approach,

235
00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:39,166
in a different way.

236
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,375
I could do both, so I did.

237
00:09:41,417 --> 00:09:45,041
Well, we're looking for
team players, not superstars.

238
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,583
Well, look no further, really.

239
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:49,166
I mean, I love
the team approach.

240
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,875
In fact, I'm really happy
to hear you say

241
00:09:50,917 --> 00:09:52,500
that you're not moving
away from it.

242
00:09:52,542 --> 00:09:53,917
What does that mean?

243
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:56,041
Frankly, I know about

244
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,625
your problems with
the medical board.

245
00:09:57,667 --> 00:09:59,041
Everyone does.

246
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:01,041
I understand the instinct
to hunker down

247
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,083
and play defense, but...

248
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:06,208
You already gave them
Dr. Turner as a scapegoat.

249
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,500
You don't need to do more.

250
00:10:07,542 --> 00:10:09,500
Unfortunately, the medical board
doesn't agree.

251
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,083
That might be because
they don't have

252
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:12,208
every side of the story.

253
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,458
What do you mean?

254
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,709
If I were you guys,

255
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,083
I would start to play
a little offense.

256
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,083
Okay, offense, defense.

257
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,041
You know, this is
a very real threat

258
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,875
that requires a real solution,
Dr. Reilly,

259
00:10:21,917 --> 00:10:24,041
not some sports clichés.

260
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,709
What I was going to say is
be smart.

261
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,000
I mean, you're all
under suspicion, right?

262
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,041
So take yourselves
out of the process.

263
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:33,041
Spend five minutes,

264
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:35,500
find out who left the board
most recently,

265
00:10:35,542 --> 00:10:37,709
because I guarantee
they're in the private sector

266
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,041
and they're for hire.

267
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,083
So you bring them on
as a consultant

268
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,000
and share with them
your success stories

269
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,583
on how you guys
work together,

270
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,041
how you share
patient information,

271
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,041
everything you're doing
that's bringing the board

272
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,375
on top of you right now.

273
00:10:49,417 --> 00:10:51,166
You give them all the ammo
you can find,

274
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,709
files, letters from patients,
pictures of healthy children,

275
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,333
anything you can find, and then
let them

276
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,333
sell it back
to their friends on the board.

277
00:10:58,375 --> 00:10:59,834
Everyone wins, right?

278
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:03,583
Oh, and the consultant's
also going to tell you

279
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:07,208
to change the name
of your practice, so...

280
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,000
You might start
thinking about that now.

281
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:16,959
Oh.

282
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:19,542
I'm so sorry.
You all right?

283
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,041
Yes.

284
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:22,375
You're Dr. Violet Turner,
right?

285
00:11:22,417 --> 00:11:24,375
Yes. Have we met?

286
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:27,291
Uh, no, actually.
But I've read your book.

287
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,083
Very impressive.

288
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,458
Yes, my book.

289
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,333
I always forget that
my picture's on the cover.

290
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,125
Well, you should be
very proud of it.

291
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,542
It takes a lot of courage

292
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,834
to put it all out there,
and you did.

293
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,041
And there's no telling
how many people you've helped.

294
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:42,625
Thank you.

295
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:43,875
Uh, Dr. Jake Reilly.

296
00:11:43,917 --> 00:11:45,250
I just interviewed
for a job here.

297
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,041
Yes. Yes,
I just read your resume.

298
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,625
Equally impressive.

299
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:52,000
Oh, thanks. Maybe you can
put in a good word for me.

300
00:11:59,834 --> 00:12:02,166
Hey. I know you guys
are busy interviewing,

301
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,458
but I just met one of
the candidates out there.

302
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,875
Dr. Jake Reilly.
Wow. What a good guy.

303
00:12:07,917 --> 00:12:11,875
Deep thinker. It really feels
like he'd be a good fit.

304
00:12:11,917 --> 00:12:13,333
I'm just saying.

305
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,667
- Hey, come on in.
- Have a seat.

306
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,208
Oh, hey, Addison.
Hmm?

307
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,834
Come with me.

308
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,792
What's wrong?
I'm gone for a month,

309
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:30,041
and you turn my office
into a storage closet?

310
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,709
I've been going through
this all day.

311
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,291
Half these boxes
aren't even mine.

312
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,041
How do you expect me
to see patients?

313
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,667
I know.
I'm sorry, Pete.

314
00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:39,041
Violet said you weren't gonna
be back for three weeks--

315
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:41,458
did she also tell you
that she put in shower bars

316
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,917
because she's afraid
I'll slip,

317
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,083
or that she lays out my
vitamins like I'm 10 years old,

318
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,208
or she checks that i'm
breathing every 15 minutes?

319
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,125
Pete.
Let me help you with that.

320
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:50,542
I can handle it.
Pete. Pete--

321
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:51,709
I can handle it.

322
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,041
Respectfully,
I run this place now.

323
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,208
If you pick these up
and tear your heart stitches

324
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,208
and bleed all over
the floor of my practice,

325
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,458
it's gonna piss me off.

326
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,041
You wanna come back
to work early?

327
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:06,333
Fine. But don't be
a complete idiot about it.

328
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:12,750
I will have these cleared out
by the end of the day.

329
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,000
Charlotte's
the chief of staff.

330
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,458
You can't expect her
to break the rules

331
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,041
just because she's your wife.
Sure I can.

332
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,875
You know if it was Pete
asking, you would do it.

333
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:28,083
Well,
Pete would never ask,

334
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,834
because that would involve
communicating with me.

335
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:34,750
You and Pete
are not speaking?

336
00:13:34,792 --> 00:13:38,333
Yes, we did at the beginning,
after the heart attack.

337
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:41,041
But, no, for the last few
weeks, he barely looks at me.

338
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,667
And then when he does,
he's never smiling.

339
00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:44,041
Hmm.

340
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,291
I don't know,
I'm beginning to think

341
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,166
that his early return to work
has less to do with work

342
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:48,625
and more with
getting away from me.

343
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:50,125
Yeah, probably.

344
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,542
Wow.
What?

345
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,208
I don't know. I guess I was
just kind of hoping for:

346
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,750
"Don't be crazy, Violet.
Your husband loves you."

347
00:13:58,792 --> 00:14:01,041
Of course he loves you,
but he also hates you.

348
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,208
I mean, he's been laying
on his ass for a month,

349
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,709
totally dependent on you.

350
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,208
Okay, so you're saying

351
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,083
that he's emasculated
by his condition

352
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,625
and he's projecting
that on me.

353
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:11,625
No, those are big shrinky
words I wouldn't use.

354
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:13,542
What I'm saying is...

355
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:18,417
Look, from what I hear,
this morning,

356
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,625
in front of all of
his colleagues,

357
00:14:20,667 --> 00:14:22,208
you pulled a chair
out for him,

358
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,291
and you told him what kind of
coffee he can drink.

359
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,667
I'm worried about him.

360
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:30,041
I know,
but you gotta ease up

361
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,583
on the Florence nightingale
routine,

362
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:34,041
because unless it comes
with a naughty nurse's outfit,

363
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,417
he's not gonna like it.

364
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,041
Hey.

365
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,041
Find anyone good?

366
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,875
Uh, yeah, a few.

367
00:14:47,917 --> 00:14:50,709
But front-runner
is still Jake Reilly.

368
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:52,959
You don't like him.

369
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,709
No.

370
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:01,041
Yes.
Jake is the Fiji guy.

371
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,417
I mean, almost-Fiji guy.

372
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,375
Oh, you mean
at the airport?

373
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:07,041
Yes.
Wow.

374
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,583
Yeah, so if you can find
anything on his resume

375
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:13,041
that is sketchy, shady,
or in any way questionable,

376
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,250
please tell me, because
I'm the only one in the office

377
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:16,500
who doesn't like this guy,

378
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:18,041
and I'm starting to
run out of excuses.

379
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,792
Okay. Well, uh...

380
00:15:20,834 --> 00:15:22,041
He is not a member

381
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:25,709
of the American society
for reproductive medicine.

382
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,041
You're not serious.

383
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,500
Naomi used to talk about it.
It's not on his resume.

384
00:15:29,542 --> 00:15:32,041
It's his only shortcoming.

385
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,333
Really?
I'm sorry.

386
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:35,667
Does Sam know?

387
00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:38,041
No, and I have
no intention of telling him.

388
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,959
We were broken up. All I did
was go to the airport.

389
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,709
I kissed him once.

390
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,542
Actually, more than once,
but I did not go to Fiji,

391
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,458
and that's what counts.

392
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,792
You know,
and Sam and I are great.

393
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,583
So why can't we hire him?

394
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,500
Dr. Freedman?

395
00:16:02,542 --> 00:16:04,333
Hey, sleepyhead.

396
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,709
All right.
You ready to watch this movie?

397
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,000
You okay?

398
00:16:12,417 --> 00:16:14,041
I'm a little tired.

399
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,792
Can we watch it tomorrow?

400
00:16:15,834 --> 00:16:17,792
You sure?

401
00:16:17,834 --> 00:16:19,291
Okay.

402
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:22,583
I can't watch it tomorrow,
but I can come Saturday.

403
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,917
Okay.
Okay?

404
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:28,458
Will I still be alive?

405
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,917
Bingo.

406
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,959
I know it's a lot to digest,

407
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,041
but kerri does not have
a lot of time.

408
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:26,417
This disease,
it's like a cancer?

409
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:29,208
Yeah. It is cancer,
but of the blood.

410
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,000
Oh, she's so young.

411
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,333
With all due respect,
Dr. Freedman,

412
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,041
what does this have to do
with us?

413
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,458
When each of your boys
was born,

414
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,041
you decided to keep and store
their cord blood.

415
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,041
And according to our database,
your oldest son, kip,

416
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,625
is a perfect match
for kerri.

417
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:45,041
Um, the cord blood bank,

418
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,375
it's supposed to be
confidential.

419
00:17:46,417 --> 00:17:48,625
Who gave you permission
to look at our records?

420
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,041
I'm gonna go shoot hoops.

421
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,458
Make sure you're home
for dinner.

422
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,041
Okay.

423
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,458
- Is that kip?
- That's Matt.

424
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,041
Kip died in a car accident
when he was 6.

425
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:01,667
But we've kept his cord blood
in case Matt ever needs it.

426
00:18:01,709 --> 00:18:04,500
- Oh. I'm sorry for your loss.
- Um...

427
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:07,458
- But Matt is a teenager now.
- So?

428
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,041
Well, at his age,

429
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:11,291
the odds that he would need
cord blood are miniscule.

430
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:14,208
It's easy to talk about odds
when you haven't lost a child.

431
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,125
And I can't imagine
how painful that's been.

432
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:21,417
But you do have the opportunity
to spare another family

433
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:24,333
the grief
that you've been through.

434
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:30,291
Here's my chip.
Thirty days sober.

435
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,000
Good for you.

436
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:36,250
So now there's no more excuses
why my name keeps disappearing

437
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,041
from the surgical rotation
every week.

438
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,750
I'll think about it.

439
00:18:39,792 --> 00:18:41,333
But you let me do
Pete's surgery,

440
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:42,750
and I saved his life.

441
00:18:42,792 --> 00:18:45,083
I told you,
it was a one-time exception.

442
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,583
Thank you.

443
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,000
Now it's time to get back
to saving yourself.

444
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,917
I haven't had a drink
in a month.

445
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:52,125
So you say.

446
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:54,709
What do you want me to do to
prove it, take a breathalyzer?

447
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,125
You want me to pee
in a cup?

448
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,500
You cut into a patient's head
after you'd been drinking.

449
00:18:58,542 --> 00:19:00,750
Both that patient and Pete
survived because of me.

450
00:19:00,792 --> 00:19:02,917
What if the next one's
not so lucky?

451
00:19:23,834 --> 00:19:25,583
Wow. What's that for?

452
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:26,917
You're doing a great job.

453
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:28,834
You're not throwing around
your authority.

454
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,959
You're not rubbing it
in anyone's face.

455
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
You're just being you...

456
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,834
And I like it.

457
00:19:36,834 --> 00:19:38,542
Thank you.
Mm-hm.

458
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,500
So are you just gonna
stare at that coffee

459
00:19:44,542 --> 00:19:45,709
or you gonna pour it?

460
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,000
Well, there's
all these studies

461
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,417
about caffeine
and getting pregnant.

462
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,041
And I've already had
two cups today,

463
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,750
so I guess
I'm just staring.

464
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:54,333
Okay.

465
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,417
Look, I'm gonna be...

466
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:59,208
I'm gonna be going
off birth control,

467
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,834
and, um, I mean,
I know the odds of me

468
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:05,250
getting pregnant by mistake
are roughly a cajillion to 1,

469
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,041
but I...

470
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,083
I'm gonna need you
to start wearing condoms.

471
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:12,750
You're serious?
I wanna have a baby,

472
00:20:12,792 --> 00:20:14,041
you don't wanna have a baby.

473
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,417
It means I can't use
your sperm, so, yeah.

474
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,083
I mean, come on,
you get it, Sam.

475
00:20:19,917 --> 00:20:21,709
Condoms?

476
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,250
There's a debate happening
inside my head.

477
00:20:34,542 --> 00:20:36,291
You wanna hear both sides?

478
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,041
Okay.

479
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,041
One side says
that you're hiding in here

480
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:41,875
because you're
avoiding me personally.

481
00:20:41,917 --> 00:20:44,000
And the other side says

482
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:47,000
that you're hiding in here
to avoid the entire world.

483
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:51,500
You know Charlotte still
has me benched from surgery?

484
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:55,041
Are you getting help?
Are you clean and sober?

485
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:57,041
Because Charlotte isn't
generally unreasonable--

486
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,792
Charlotte's a bitch, Sheldon.

487
00:20:58,834 --> 00:21:01,041
She's a bitch
and she's a control freak

488
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,041
and she's a turncoat.

489
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,542
A turncoat?
In aa,

490
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,750
the old-timers tell you to keep
your mouth shut at work.

491
00:21:05,792 --> 00:21:07,959
They tell you not to break
your anonymity to anyone,

492
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,041
especially if you are
a doctor or a lawyer

493
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,834
or a pilot
or anything where anyone

494
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,917
could use your admission
of addiction against you.

495
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:15,500
They tell you
to keep your mouth shut,

496
00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:17,333
even if you have been sober
for 20 years,

497
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,041
because people
don't understand.

498
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,041
I didn't listen.
I opened my mouth.

499
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,625
I opened my mouth

500
00:21:22,667 --> 00:21:24,458
because Charlotte needed me
to open my mouth.

501
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,500
After her rape,
she needed me.

502
00:21:27,917 --> 00:21:30,875
Look, one in ten people
is an alcoholic or an addict.

503
00:21:30,917 --> 00:21:32,792
And only one in ten
of those people

504
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:34,083
even tries to get help.

505
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,291
I have been sober for years,
and I am sober again.

506
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,667
But do I get any credit
from Charlotte? No.

507
00:21:38,709 --> 00:21:40,041
Because I made the mistake

508
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,917
of helping her
when she needed me,

509
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:44,041
and because I had a few drinks
over a month ago,

510
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:46,083
I am benched.
No credit, no gratitude.

511
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:48,709
So the answer to your debate,
Sheldon, is everyone.

512
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,917
I am in here
hiding from everyone.

513
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,500
So you're gonna feel
a little bit of warmth

514
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:08,834
as the medicine goes in.

515
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:10,208
That feels weird.

516
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:13,375
Yeah, it should go away
in just a minute.

517
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:15,542
I'm going to get better now?

518
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,041
Well, that is the idea.

519
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:18,750
Cooper.

520
00:22:18,792 --> 00:22:20,375
I saw your name
on the procedure list.

521
00:22:20,417 --> 00:22:22,041
What are you doing?

522
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:23,709
Giving kerri
a chance to live.

523
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,375
But where'd you
get the cord blood?

524
00:22:26,417 --> 00:22:29,709
Oh, a donor match came
through the registry.

525
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,041
Consent form's on your desk.

526
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,000
I'm glad it all worked out.

527
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:35,333
Amazing, right?

528
00:22:52,917 --> 00:22:54,250
There's a word for this,
you know,

529
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:56,208
you and I running
into one another.

530
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,458
Yeah, the word you're
looking for is "nerve."

531
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,834
The nerve of you
coming into my practice,

532
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:02,041
wasting my time,

533
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:04,166
when clearly,
you have ulterior motives.

534
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:05,166
Whoa. Hold on a second.

535
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:07,041
You think I came in
for a job interview

536
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:09,041
just to get you
to go out with me?

537
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:10,041
It's very convenient.

538
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:11,333
Actually, it is.

539
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:14,041
Your practice is already
affiliated with St. ambrose,

540
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:16,041
which is where I see
most of my patients,

541
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:18,083
not to mention, you're only
a 15-minute walk

542
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:19,208
from my house,

543
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,500
so you'll be helping me
to reduce my carbon footprint.

544
00:23:21,542 --> 00:23:22,875
Heh. That's rich.

545
00:23:22,917 --> 00:23:25,041
I hate to burst your bubble
over there, Dr. Montgomery,

546
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:26,291
but, uh, I'm a catch.

547
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:28,208
And so humble.
All I'm saying is

548
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,625
there are plenty of
beautiful, intelligent women

549
00:23:30,667 --> 00:23:32,041
I could be with
if I wanted to be.

550
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:33,834
Do you really think
I tracked you down,

551
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:35,208
pretended to be
interested in a job,

552
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,041
put myself through
the interview process,

553
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,166
just to get a date with you?

554
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:42,041
Though I will say,
having a friendly face

555
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:43,625
around here
is a selling point.

556
00:23:43,667 --> 00:23:44,625
Oh, we are not friends.

557
00:23:44,667 --> 00:23:46,458
I was talking about Sam.

558
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,083
Oh, it was
intramural basketball.

559
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:51,000
It's not like
you two climbed Everest.

560
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:54,041
Hey.
Hey.

561
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:55,458
How's it going
with the hiring?

562
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,125
Oh, well,
we found a guy we like.

563
00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:59,333
Amazing credentials,
a great work history.

564
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:00,834
And?

565
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:02,500
And Addison
doesn't like him.

566
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:05,000
Well, since when does she
make the final decisions?

567
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:08,041
I know there've been
changes around here,

568
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:10,125
but we're still
a cooperative practice, right?

569
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:12,250
Officially, no. Officially,

570
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:14,834
we all work for Addison and
answer to Addison.

571
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:17,041
We agreed to that
to keep the doors open,

572
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:18,959
for the medical board.
I mean,

573
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,041
we had to make changes
on paper, I get it.

574
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:23,458
But does that mean we don't
make decisions together anymore?

575
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,500
If that's what it means--
Pete, take it easy.

576
00:24:25,542 --> 00:24:27,083
No, are you guys
just gonna roll over

577
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:29,041
and let her push us around?

578
00:24:30,959 --> 00:24:32,041
It's just like
with the boxes.

579
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:33,959
She doesn't respect
any one of us.

580
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:37,250
Someone didn't get
enough sleep last night.

581
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:39,041
I don't think
sleep is the issue.

582
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:40,917
Well, he's had
major heart surgery.

583
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:42,917
There's no way
his body's 100 percent.

584
00:24:42,959 --> 00:24:44,917
I wasn't talking about
his physical health.

585
00:24:44,959 --> 00:24:46,875
It's only been a month
since his heart attack.

586
00:24:46,917 --> 00:24:48,667
Not only is he dealing
with mortality issues,

587
00:24:48,709 --> 00:24:50,542
but he's in emotional
overload.

588
00:24:50,583 --> 00:24:52,291
You know,
fear, depression, guilt,

589
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:53,917
they're all colliding.

590
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:55,625
No wonder he's so frustrated.

591
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:57,041
It's not just frustration.

592
00:24:57,083 --> 00:25:00,166
He's angry.
It's a typical response.

593
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:02,583
So, what do we do?
Cut the guy some slack,

594
00:25:02,625 --> 00:25:04,375
give him some space
to work out his issues,

595
00:25:04,417 --> 00:25:07,166
and in time,
he'll find his equilibrium.

596
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:16,625
Hey.
Hey. What's happening?

597
00:25:16,667 --> 00:25:19,417
What's the, uh, inside scoop
on the hiring situation?

598
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:24,166
Still doing interviews,
checking references.

599
00:25:24,208 --> 00:25:25,834
You know how
this process works.

600
00:25:25,875 --> 00:25:27,041
Yeah, don't sweat it.

601
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:29,458
You'll know
when you know, right?

602
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,667
Listen, I'm gonna go grab
a beer later on

603
00:25:32,709 --> 00:25:34,458
with some of the doctors
from the practice.

604
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,041
You want to join,
meet a few of them?

605
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:37,458
Sounds good.

606
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,291
Cool.
I'll check you later.

607
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:43,041
How dare you people
do this to us?

608
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,875
And you are?
Robert Weston.

609
00:25:44,917 --> 00:25:47,041
You used my son's cord blood
without my permission.

610
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:49,000
Uh, we have
your signed consent.

611
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:55,959
That's not my signature.

612
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,542
Well, there's been
a misunderstanding.

613
00:25:57,583 --> 00:26:00,291
I told Dr. Freedman that he
couldn't use kip's cord blood.

614
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:02,375
But after he left our house,
I was concerned,

615
00:26:02,417 --> 00:26:03,500
so I called the hospital.

616
00:26:03,542 --> 00:26:05,083
It turns out
you used it on a patient.

617
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:07,458
That is not your blood to take.
You need to believe me.

618
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,667
I'll deal with this
and Dr. Freedman.

619
00:26:09,709 --> 00:26:11,250
So will my lawyers.

620
00:26:18,709 --> 00:26:21,625
Hey.
We let you into our home,

621
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:23,041
listened to you
plead your case.

622
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:24,458
What did it get us?
I understand.

623
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,875
And what I did,

624
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:28,041
you have every right to think
I'm a terrible person.

625
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:29,834
If you knew kerri,
this beautiful little girl

626
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:31,625
whose life you saved,

627
00:26:31,667 --> 00:26:33,041
you would understand
why I did it.

628
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:35,083
You stole from us. You stole the
only thing

629
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:36,834
that was left
from our dead son.

630
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:39,667
And now,
you've given it away.

631
00:26:39,709 --> 00:26:42,500
We can never get that back.

632
00:26:54,917 --> 00:26:56,417
I was just about to call you.
Look at this.

633
00:26:56,458 --> 00:26:58,041
Kerri's blood count.

634
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:00,041
There is no evidence of any
abnormal white blood cells.

635
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:01,500
It's working.
How great is that?

636
00:27:01,542 --> 00:27:03,917
Did you really think
you'd get away with it?

637
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:07,917
Charlotte--
I checked my computer.

638
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:11,166
You used my password to access
our private blood bank?

639
00:27:11,208 --> 00:27:12,583
Will you let me explain this?

640
00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:14,166
Do you realize
what you've done?

641
00:27:14,208 --> 00:27:16,000
I saved this little girl's
life,

642
00:27:16,041 --> 00:27:18,000
which is the right thing to do--
don't you dare.

643
00:27:18,041 --> 00:27:19,500
I was not gonna sit
and watch her die.

644
00:27:19,542 --> 00:27:21,291
We've been through this,
Cooper.

645
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:23,041
You don't get to
make up the rules

646
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:25,041
every time
a patient needs your help.

647
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:27,375
We're all doctors.
We all love our patients.

648
00:27:27,417 --> 00:27:29,041
Charlotte, don't--
you broke the law,

649
00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:30,792
and you broke my trust.

650
00:27:30,834 --> 00:27:33,083
You're a doctor,
and you're an adult,

651
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:34,542
and you're my husband,

652
00:27:34,583 --> 00:27:36,125
and you didn't act like
any of those things

653
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:38,291
when you
made this decision.

654
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,125
You have no self-control,
and I am tired of it.

655
00:27:54,417 --> 00:27:56,792
So you're a dad, huh?
Good for you, Sam.

656
00:27:56,834 --> 00:27:58,333
Yeah.

657
00:27:58,375 --> 00:28:00,792
He's a granddad.
Man, can you believe that?

658
00:28:00,834 --> 00:28:03,041
What about you, any kids?

659
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:05,000
Never had the time
to make any.

660
00:28:05,041 --> 00:28:07,750
Me neither,
but we love to try.

661
00:28:07,792 --> 00:28:09,583
Wow. Someone's not
pacing themselves.

662
00:28:09,625 --> 00:28:11,041
Self-control's overrated.

663
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:13,041
I'll drink to that.

664
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:15,583
I like you. I like him.

665
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,417
Why haven't we hired him yet?

666
00:28:18,458 --> 00:28:19,417
You know why.

667
00:28:19,458 --> 00:28:20,959
We have to do
our due diligence

668
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,333
to the other applicants.
Yeah, right.

669
00:28:23,375 --> 00:28:25,041
You sound like a guy
in the know,

670
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:27,625
so, what do I gotta do
to get this guy on board?

671
00:28:27,667 --> 00:28:29,625
Well, I would start
with this guy's girlfriend.

672
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:31,875
Mm. All right.
That's it. You're cut off.

673
00:28:31,917 --> 00:28:33,875
Whoop. Aw!

674
00:28:33,917 --> 00:28:35,166
I have to take a leak.

675
00:28:35,208 --> 00:28:37,875
Addison.
Addison's your ticket.

676
00:28:41,834 --> 00:28:43,625
Dr. Montgomery
is your girlfriend?

677
00:28:43,667 --> 00:28:45,166
Yeah. Yeah, we don't have

678
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:48,041
a non-fraternization policy
at the office, so...

679
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:50,458
She seems great.

680
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,041
You're a lucky guy.

681
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:54,125
Thank you.
Thank you.

682
00:28:56,458 --> 00:28:57,834
I left messages
for the westons.

683
00:28:57,875 --> 00:28:59,250
I'm hoping to talk to them

684
00:28:59,291 --> 00:29:01,542
before I need to
bring this to the board.

685
00:29:01,583 --> 00:29:03,041
Yeah, I'll keep you informed.

686
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:04,208
Oh, hey,
you have a minute?

687
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,875
Oh. I have had it
up to here

688
00:29:05,917 --> 00:29:07,917
with doctors playing fast
and loose with the rules.

689
00:29:07,959 --> 00:29:09,291
I got surgeons
sticking scalpels

690
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:11,041
in people's brains
while drinking

691
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,208
and doctors
stealing cord blood,

692
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,208
so unless what you have to say
can change that,

693
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,709
now is not a good time.

694
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,166
I don't know anything
about cord blood,

695
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:18,667
but as far as
one particular surgeon

696
00:29:18,709 --> 00:29:21,041
who drank on duty, I...

697
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:23,417
Amelia is an excellent
surgeon.

698
00:29:23,458 --> 00:29:25,041
Her skill
is not in question.

699
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:27,291
No, I know.
Only her sobriety.

700
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:29,709
I'm not talking about this.
Then just listen.

701
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:32,041
Look, I know
what Amelia did was wrong.

702
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:33,959
But you care about her,
which means at some point,

703
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,917
you're gonna have to stop
punishing her

704
00:29:35,959 --> 00:29:37,041
and start forgiving her.

705
00:29:37,083 --> 00:29:39,208
I'm chief of staff.
I can't make exceptions

706
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,959
just because
I care about someone.

707
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,709
I'm not saying you should,
just do it by the book.

708
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,041
Let her take the test,

709
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:47,041
check to see
if she's still drinking.

710
00:29:47,083 --> 00:29:48,000
She's an addict, Sheldon.

711
00:29:49,291 --> 00:29:52,208
Maybe. But if this were
any other surgeon,

712
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:54,083
would you be holding her
to the same standard?

713
00:30:00,959 --> 00:30:02,000
Hey.

714
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:03,041
Hey.
Grr.

715
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:05,458
Ha-ha-ha.
Mwah.

716
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,542
You're late.

717
00:30:06,583 --> 00:30:08,041
Boys' night out
must have been fun.

718
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:10,458
Yeah, I wanted to make sure
Coop got home in one piece,

719
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,458
so I had the cab
drop him off first.

720
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,250
That drunk, huh?

721
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:16,542
Uh, yeah.
Ha-ha-ha.

722
00:30:16,583 --> 00:30:18,542
Yeah?
But he had a good time, though.

723
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:19,917
I had a good time.

724
00:30:19,959 --> 00:30:21,250
Jake had a good time too.

725
00:30:21,291 --> 00:30:22,709
Wait, Jake went?

726
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:26,041
Yeah, I invited him.
He's cool.

727
00:30:26,083 --> 00:30:28,041
I think that you're wrong
about him.

728
00:30:29,542 --> 00:30:31,917
I know that you don't think

729
00:30:31,959 --> 00:30:34,083
he's a good fit
for the practice,

730
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:37,333
but he's a good doctor.

731
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:39,917
He's a skilled doctor.

732
00:30:39,959 --> 00:30:43,709
And we all work
long, hard hours,

733
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:46,041
and to have someone around
that everybody likes

734
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:48,000
I think is a good thing.

735
00:30:48,041 --> 00:30:50,709
I know, I know
that you miss Naomi.

736
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,500
I miss Naomi too.

737
00:30:52,542 --> 00:30:55,583
But I think
that you're wrong about him.

738
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:57,083
Okay.
Okay.

739
00:30:57,125 --> 00:30:59,041
Can we stop now,
talking about Naomi and...?

740
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:00,458
Sure.

741
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,417
...Jake?

742
00:31:01,458 --> 00:31:03,625
Mm-hm.
Mm.

743
00:31:03,667 --> 00:31:06,000
Did you--?
Did you buy some condoms?

744
00:31:07,083 --> 00:31:09,041
You know
I don't like to wear those.

745
00:31:09,083 --> 00:31:12,250
I know, but this is not--
this is not about fashion, Sam.

746
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:14,166
Okay, okay.
I'll be careful.

747
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:16,041
I'll be careful.
I'll be real careful.

748
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:17,333
No, no. Come on.

749
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:18,667
We're not in high school

750
00:31:18,709 --> 00:31:22,834
in the back of my parents'
Mercedes, Sam.

751
00:31:25,458 --> 00:31:28,709
You know,
no glove, no love.

752
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:33,834
I'm serious.

753
00:31:45,083 --> 00:31:47,875
Hey. Wow.

754
00:31:47,917 --> 00:31:49,291
That's a lot of pills.

755
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:52,625
He's gonna have to take them
every day for a year.

756
00:31:52,667 --> 00:31:54,500
A year.

757
00:31:54,542 --> 00:31:57,041
Scary. The whole thing must be
terrifying to both of you.

758
00:31:57,083 --> 00:32:00,166
Uh, it's not terrifying,
Sheldon, it's, um...

759
00:32:01,417 --> 00:32:05,583
...life-altering,
wholly and completely.

760
00:32:05,625 --> 00:32:08,917
This kind of thing
changes everything.

761
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:12,041
Will you talk about
something else?

762
00:32:12,083 --> 00:32:13,208
Really?
The reason I came in

763
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,542
is to talk about Pete,

764
00:32:14,583 --> 00:32:16,208
and that I don't think
he's ready to be back.

765
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:18,041
Think you're saying
anything I don't know?

766
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:20,083
Think anything occupies my mind
right now except

767
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:22,291
that he should not be here?
Okay. Something else.

768
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:26,208
Uh, did you know that Sam
and Addison moved in together?

769
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:27,917
And she still wants
to have a baby?

770
00:32:27,959 --> 00:32:29,917
She thinks she's gonna
compartmentalize Sam

771
00:32:29,959 --> 00:32:32,041
and her pregnancy plans and--

772
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:34,041
okay, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait. Okay.

773
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:38,291
So she wants to have a baby,
but not with Sam,

774
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:39,667
who happens to be the guy

775
00:32:39,709 --> 00:32:41,083
she's living with
and sleeping with,

776
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,041
and he doesn't
want to have a baby,

777
00:32:43,083 --> 00:32:45,709
so she's gonna have one
with a sperm donor?

778
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:48,917
And she's gonna deal with ivf
and hormonal fluctuations,

779
00:32:48,959 --> 00:32:50,750
and at the same time,
take over the practice,

780
00:32:50,792 --> 00:32:52,458
so she's gonna
have to run this place

781
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,000
and handle all of us and...

782
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:56,667
How did you let this happen?

783
00:32:56,709 --> 00:32:58,041
Me?

784
00:32:58,083 --> 00:33:00,375
Well, I was home with Pete.
You couldn't have weighed in?

785
00:33:00,417 --> 00:33:01,625
You couldn't have advised

786
00:33:01,667 --> 00:33:03,083
against
this catastrophic decision

787
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:05,959
that's ultimately going to
affect everyone who works here?

788
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,709
No, this is a hazard
of our trade,

789
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,583
this thing where we always
think six steps ahead.

790
00:33:09,625 --> 00:33:11,083
I mean, our friends
make decisions,

791
00:33:11,125 --> 00:33:12,542
and we're shrinks,

792
00:33:12,583 --> 00:33:15,041
so our brains automatically
analyze those decisions

793
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:17,041
and project psychologically
based eventualities,

794
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:20,125
most of which come true,
and we can't control that.

795
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:22,959
But maybe we can control this,
or at least influence it.

796
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,959
The only thing we can control
is whether or not

797
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,792
we say what we're thinking
to our friends.

798
00:33:27,834 --> 00:33:30,750
And when we weigh in,
you know what happens?

799
00:33:30,792 --> 00:33:32,041
What happens is,

800
00:33:32,083 --> 00:33:34,041
they do
what they're gonna do anyway,

801
00:33:34,083 --> 00:33:36,583
because they're in love,
and because people are flawed,

802
00:33:36,625 --> 00:33:38,917
and because
human beings require pain

803
00:33:38,959 --> 00:33:40,333
in order to learn and grow--

804
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:42,834
so you don't think there's
anything we could say to help?

805
00:33:42,875 --> 00:33:44,083
When you say
every shrink thought

806
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:45,709
that you ever had out loud,

807
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:48,375
you become
the "I told you so" friend.

808
00:33:48,417 --> 00:33:50,208
Doesn't help anybody.

809
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:56,500
Excuse me.
Dr. Montgomery.

810
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:01,041
You don't want me
to join the practice

811
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:04,000
because Sam
is your boyfriend, right?

812
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:08,375
How did you--?
Who told you?

813
00:34:08,417 --> 00:34:09,625
It doesn't matter.

814
00:34:09,667 --> 00:34:11,458
Did...?

815
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,875
Did you say any--?

816
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:16,041
No, I didn't say
anything about Fiji.

817
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:17,667
Thank you.

818
00:34:17,709 --> 00:34:19,959
And just so you know,
when you invited me,

819
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,625
Sam and I,
we were broken up.

820
00:34:21,667 --> 00:34:25,083
Just forget it, okay?
That whole thing.

821
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:26,917
That whole thing?
This is awkward for me.

822
00:34:26,959 --> 00:34:28,291
You have to understand that.

823
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:30,041
I'm not using you
as a fertility doctor,

824
00:34:30,083 --> 00:34:32,083
despite the fact that
you're the best in the city.

825
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:34,834
That should tell you something.
Believe me when I say this.

826
00:34:34,875 --> 00:34:36,375
I like your practice
and the people in it,

827
00:34:36,417 --> 00:34:38,667
and that's all. And if you hire
me,

828
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:40,041
I will never,
ever hit on you.

829
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:42,000
I won't even look your way.

830
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:46,041
Oh, and, uh, I joined

831
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:48,041
the American society
for reproductive medicine,

832
00:34:48,083 --> 00:34:50,125
so you're fresh
out of excuses.

833
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:04,041
It's decaf.

834
00:35:04,083 --> 00:35:06,041
Great.

835
00:35:06,083 --> 00:35:08,083
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

836
00:35:08,125 --> 00:35:10,166
It's time for your meds.

837
00:35:14,709 --> 00:35:17,667
How are you?
Mm. Fine.

838
00:35:17,709 --> 00:35:19,041
I can see
that you're physically fine,

839
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:20,458
but I was just wondering,

840
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,083
how does it feel
to be back at work?

841
00:35:22,125 --> 00:35:23,667
Because I was
talking to Sheldon--

842
00:35:23,709 --> 00:35:25,041
you wanna know
how I feel?

843
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:26,500
You wanna know
how I honestly feel?

844
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:29,250
I feel like
I can't get away from you.

845
00:35:29,291 --> 00:35:31,333
I feel like
you're smothering me.

846
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:34,041
Isn't it enough that you're
my wife and my nursemaid?

847
00:35:34,083 --> 00:35:36,542
You wanna be my shrink?
Go home, Violet.

848
00:35:36,583 --> 00:35:39,041
Go home
and be a mother to our son,

849
00:35:39,083 --> 00:35:40,709
because I don't
want you here!

850
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,500
And you don't have patients!

851
00:35:42,542 --> 00:35:44,041
You don't have a license!

852
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:48,041
You have no business here,
Violet. Go home!

853
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,875
I know it must have been
difficult coming in here.

854
00:35:59,917 --> 00:36:01,125
You were certainly persistent.

855
00:36:01,166 --> 00:36:02,458
I thought
it might be helpful

856
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,291
to explain the new protocols
we've put in place

857
00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:06,750
to prevent this
from happening in the future.

858
00:36:06,792 --> 00:36:08,709
Is that supposed
to make us feel better,

859
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,583
you worked the kinks
out of the system?

860
00:36:10,625 --> 00:36:12,291
Uh, Robert,
let's just hear her out.

861
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:14,041
No. This was a mistake.

862
00:36:14,083 --> 00:36:15,417
Dr. King?

863
00:36:15,458 --> 00:36:18,792
Dr. King, I just wanted
to say thank you

864
00:36:18,834 --> 00:36:21,041
for everything
you've done for kerri.

865
00:36:21,083 --> 00:36:22,375
Do you have time to see her?

866
00:36:22,417 --> 00:36:24,041
Well, I was
showing the westons out.

867
00:36:24,083 --> 00:36:25,792
As soon as I'm done.

868
00:36:25,834 --> 00:36:27,041
You're the parents.

869
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:30,625
Oh, my god.

870
00:36:30,667 --> 00:36:32,250
I can't thank you enough.

871
00:36:33,875 --> 00:36:36,917
What you've done for my
family, for kerri--

872
00:36:36,959 --> 00:36:38,583
how is she?

873
00:36:38,625 --> 00:36:41,542
She's, uh...
She's getting better.

874
00:36:41,583 --> 00:36:44,625
I don't even remember
the last time I said that.

875
00:36:44,667 --> 00:36:47,041
You know, I'm sure
she'd love to meet you.

876
00:36:47,083 --> 00:36:49,709
Please. Come on.

877
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:58,041
How did you--?
Had nothing to do with me.

878
00:36:58,083 --> 00:37:00,208
I was just walking the westons
to the elevator.

879
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,166
They ran into each other.

880
00:37:05,166 --> 00:37:07,041
You know,
the elevator's actually--

881
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:08,458
you were wrong, Cooper.

882
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,709
Breaking into my computer,
stealing that cord blood.

883
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:14,750
Regardless of the outcome,
you were wrong.

884
00:37:16,041 --> 00:37:18,083
You better pray Matt Weston
never needs that blood,

885
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:20,083
because you're not god.

886
00:37:20,125 --> 00:37:22,083
It's not your job
to play god.

887
00:37:22,125 --> 00:37:23,375
Charlotte--

888
00:37:23,417 --> 00:37:25,291
I made this go away
because I love you.

889
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:27,667
But if you ever
screw with me again,

890
00:37:27,709 --> 00:37:29,917
if you ever
cross me like this,

891
00:37:29,959 --> 00:37:32,083
I'll report you to the cops

892
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:34,000
and let them throw
your sorry ass in jail.

893
00:37:46,959 --> 00:37:48,667
The fast one.

894
00:37:48,709 --> 00:37:50,667
Which one is faster,
truck or car?

895
00:37:50,709 --> 00:37:53,291
The truck...
Truck.

896
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:58,083
Yeah.

897
00:38:01,834 --> 00:38:03,208
So, um...

898
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:05,041
Vroom.

899
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:07,625
I don't know
what my job is anymore.

900
00:38:07,667 --> 00:38:10,041
As a doctor, your wife...

901
00:38:10,083 --> 00:38:11,291
I...

902
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:15,125
I don't know what my job is,
but you're right

903
00:38:15,166 --> 00:38:18,041
that, um,
I can't be your therapist.

904
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:22,917
So, that means that
you really need to get one.

905
00:38:22,959 --> 00:38:25,709
Because you were mean.

906
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,917
You were really mean.

907
00:38:27,959 --> 00:38:31,041
And I will be your wife,
and I will be your nursemaid,

908
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:34,917
as much as neither of us
likes it, but...

909
00:38:34,959 --> 00:38:37,291
I'm not gonna be
your punching bag.

910
00:38:37,333 --> 00:38:40,375
So you need someone
to talk to

911
00:38:41,709 --> 00:38:43,959
about whatever it is
you're going through.

912
00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:48,709
You need help.

913
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:57,208
Okay, buddy.
It's bedtime.

914
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:59,291
Want me to carry you?

915
00:38:59,333 --> 00:39:01,000
Night-night, daddy.

916
00:39:02,125 --> 00:39:03,709
Can you say night-night?

917
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:06,291
Night-night.
Night-night.

918
00:39:22,542 --> 00:39:23,834
What is that?

919
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:26,166
A breathalyzer.
Blow into it.

920
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:27,667
What?

921
00:39:27,709 --> 00:39:29,041
It was your idea.

922
00:39:29,083 --> 00:39:31,250
You wanna be on next week's
surgical rotation, right?

923
00:39:45,792 --> 00:39:47,917
You're back on the schedule.

924
00:39:49,291 --> 00:39:51,000
Thanks.

925
00:39:52,291 --> 00:39:55,041
You know, I was gonna go
to a meeting on my way home.

926
00:39:55,083 --> 00:39:56,667
Headed to one myself.

927
00:39:56,709 --> 00:39:59,041
There's one near ocean park.
If we left now, we could--

928
00:39:59,083 --> 00:40:00,917
thanks,
but I'd rather go solo.

929
00:40:12,291 --> 00:40:14,417
Hey, sorry I'm late.

930
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:15,583
Mm.

931
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:17,417
I picked up some dinner
on the way home.

932
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:19,792
Oh, good.
I'm starving.

933
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,083
Hey.
Hi.

934
00:40:22,709 --> 00:40:26,000
Um... so I hired Jake.

935
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:29,041
Really?

936
00:40:29,083 --> 00:40:30,375
Yeah.
I thought about it,

937
00:40:30,417 --> 00:40:33,208
and it's the right thing
to do.

938
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:35,750
Hmm. Oh, uh... ha, ha.

939
00:40:35,792 --> 00:40:38,041
I picked those up.

940
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:41,208
Mm-hm.

941
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,542
Sam.

942
00:40:42,583 --> 00:40:45,875
I thought about it, and
it's the right thing to do.

943
00:40:54,083 --> 00:40:56,667
Oh. Do you hear that?

944
00:40:56,709 --> 00:40:58,250
I don't hear a thing.

945
00:40:58,291 --> 00:41:00,750
I know.

946
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,083
No music.
Mm-mm.

947
00:41:02,125 --> 00:41:07,083
No party.
No hot guy stumbling home.

948
00:41:07,125 --> 00:41:09,500
Amelia must have had
a long day.

949
00:41:09,542 --> 00:41:11,709
Finally, some peace and quiet
for us tonight.

950
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:13,291
Mm.

951
00:41:13,333 --> 00:41:15,542
Hmm.
Mm, mm.

952
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:43,250
I cheated on Derek.

953
00:41:45,083 --> 00:41:47,041
That's why he moved
to the woods.

954
00:41:47,083 --> 00:41:49,041
I slept with his best friend,
he caught us,

955
00:41:49,083 --> 00:41:53,709
he physically removed me
from our apartment in Manhattan,

956
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:56,083
and he moved to the woods.

957
00:41:56,125 --> 00:41:58,083
But I didn't cheat on Sam.

958
00:41:58,125 --> 00:42:01,166
No, I met Jake
when Sam and I were broken up.

959
00:42:01,208 --> 00:42:02,667
So there's nothing to confess.

960
00:42:02,709 --> 00:42:04,625
There's no reason
to be scared.

961
00:42:04,667 --> 00:42:09,417
I don't wanna lose Sam,
but, no, I'm not scared.

962
00:42:09,458 --> 00:42:11,417
I'm...

963
00:42:11,458 --> 00:42:15,041
Wow. Okay, I may be
delusional, but, heh...

964
00:42:15,083 --> 00:42:17,166
I swear to god,

965
00:42:18,291 --> 00:42:22,208
for the first time
in a long time,

966
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:24,083
I'm happy.
