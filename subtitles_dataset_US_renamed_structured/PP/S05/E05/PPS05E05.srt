♪ Ohhh ohhh ohhh ♪

2
00:00:10,083 --> 00:00:11,834
There are basically five steps

3
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:13,500
to the ivf process.

4
00:00:13,542 --> 00:00:16,041
One, they stimulate
and monitor the development

5
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:18,917
of healthy eggs
in the ovaries.

6
00:00:18,959 --> 00:00:20,959
Two, they harvest the eggs.

7
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:24,000
Three, they select
and secure sperm.

8
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:28,041
Four, they combine the egg
and the sperm in a lab

9
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:31,041
and provide an appropriate
environment for fertilization

10
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:32,959
and early embryo growth.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,834
And five,
they select--

12
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:41,041
identify the best embryos
and transfer them to the uterus.

13
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,041
I'm at step one. Heh.

14
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:45,333
How are you feeling
about that?

15
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:49,000
I feel like...

16
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:50,125
Heh.

17
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:51,917
Like I'm at step one.

18
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:54,709
I got hormones.

19
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,625
Congratulations.
You pulled the trigger.

20
00:00:56,667 --> 00:00:58,000
It's not quite
congratulations yet

21
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:00,000
because I haven't pulled
the trigger,

22
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:02,500
because the shots
go in my ass.

23
00:01:02,542 --> 00:01:04,250
Sam can't pull the trigger?

24
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:05,875
I like to be sexy with Sam,

25
00:01:05,917 --> 00:01:08,083
and shots
that stimulate egg production?

26
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:09,083
Not sexy.

27
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:10,834
Enough said.

28
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:14,542
Okay.

29
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:20,166
And this stays between us,
right?

30
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:22,709
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

31
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:30,458
God, I miss Naomi.

32
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:39,041
What are you--?
What are you doing?

33
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:40,625
Just calm down.

34
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,875
Massaging the area
helps to absorb the hormones.

35
00:01:42,917 --> 00:01:46,083
I'm deriving absolutely
no pleasure from this

36
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:47,709
whatsoever.

37
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,000
Well, ahem, thank you.

38
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:55,041
Now it's congratulations.

39
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:57,041
Well, my fsh is really high.

40
00:01:57,083 --> 00:02:00,166
I don't know if I'll get any
good eggs out of it.

41
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:02,083
It's still congratulations.
There's no way to know

42
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:04,792
unless you try
and you're trying.

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,917
- It's not safe.
- No one should go up.

44
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:13,041
Wes. Wes.

45
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:14,875
No one is gonna do anything
to you, honey.

46
00:02:14,917 --> 00:02:16,542
You wanted to give them
your painting.

47
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:17,667
I'm not going up there.

48
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:19,333
I don't wanna be here, mom.
It's not safe.

49
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:21,792
No one should get in there.
Karen. Wes. Everything okay?

50
00:02:21,834 --> 00:02:23,333
He's refusing to take
his heart meds.

51
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,000
He's refusing
to take any meds.

52
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:27,792
Hey, Wes. Is this your painting
here? It's really beautiful.

53
00:02:27,834 --> 00:02:30,458
Is that this building, Wes?
Yeah. The elevators hear.

54
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,583
- They hear you.
- Right.

55
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:32,709
They want you to go in.

56
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,041
Know who would love
to see this?

57
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:36,166
I'm not going up.
Dr. Turner.

58
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:37,375
Dr. Turner, Wes.

59
00:02:37,417 --> 00:02:39,083
Why don't we both take
the stairs up--?

60
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,542
They hear you
and they watch you.

61
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:44,041
He needs to start seeing
her again. He's in trouble.

62
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:46,000
Everything's gonna be okay.
Why don't you--?

63
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,125
I can't go up there.
All right.

64
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,125
I can't be here.

65
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:49,500
I can't. I can't. I can't.

66
00:02:49,542 --> 00:02:51,333
Take that.

67
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,083
Ah!

68
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,542
I can't believe you have been
running around Italy

69
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:07,041
for six months.
I'm jealous.

70
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:08,583
Don't be jealous.
Just go.

71
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:11,750
And get the pizza in Naples.
It is insane.

72
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,542
And then head straight
to Rome,

73
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:16,166
buy a large box of condoms
and never leave.

74
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:19,583
Italian men are ridiculous.
And they're everywhere.

75
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:20,959
Italian men in Italy?

76
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,583
Just standing around
in Armani suits, eating gelato.

77
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:26,041
Waiting to get attacked
by a predatory American tourist.

78
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:30,417
Never a tourist.
There I am che Donna stupenda.

79
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:31,417
A hot piece of ass.

80
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:33,208
Ha-ha-ha.
Ha-ha-ha.

81
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,375
When did your symptoms
start?

82
00:03:38,417 --> 00:03:40,583
Couple months ago,
in ravello.

83
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:41,875
We can try meds.

84
00:03:41,917 --> 00:03:43,667
There are ways that
we can manage your symptoms.

85
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:45,166
Amelia, thanks to you,

86
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,166
I had a beautiful six months
in Italy,

87
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:50,208
which I wouldn't have had,
and I am grateful.

88
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,792
So grateful.

89
00:03:52,834 --> 00:03:56,500
But I'm not gonna die
a slow death from huntington's.

90
00:03:56,542 --> 00:03:59,041
I am not going the way
my mother did.

91
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,041
I'm not. You promised.
Michelle-- I know, but--

92
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,709
it's time, Amelia.

93
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:06,417
I mean, I've had great food,

94
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,500
great sex,

95
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:10,041
great love in my life.

96
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,291
And a great friend.

97
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:14,041
I'm happy.

98
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,291
And I'm ready.

99
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:19,917
I need you
to help me die.

100
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:32,500
All right, you wanna open it?

101
00:04:32,542 --> 00:04:35,250
All right. Open it up.

102
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,041
Hi. Hey, uncle Sam.
How you doing?

103
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,417
Hey, buddy.

104
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,834
Hey, have you ever, um,
baked anything?

105
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,542
Like tried to bake?
Because it's hard.

106
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,500
Really hard.

107
00:04:44,542 --> 00:04:45,750
I had no idea how hard it was.

108
00:04:45,792 --> 00:04:47,917
It's harder than med school.
Yeah.

109
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:50,000
We have a little 2-year-old
sous-chef here.

110
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,458
- I want candy.
- I...

111
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,250
Yes. You.
Why are you here?

112
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:57,083
It's Wes.
Do you remember him?

113
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,583
Patient, the painter.
I know Wes.

114
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,709
He's off his meds.

115
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,542
Psych meds or heart meds?
All of them.

116
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:04,166
He won't see Sheldon,
he won't listen to me.

117
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,875
You're the only one he trusts.

118
00:05:05,917 --> 00:05:08,041
I know that you can't talk
to him officially,

119
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:09,291
but--
damn it.

120
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,709
Unofficially,
I was thinking maybe--

121
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,583
yeah. I'll get a sitter.
All right.

122
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,041
Watch him for a minute?
Yeah.

123
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,834
What's happening,
buddy boy?

124
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:21,041
If you and Mason are gonna be
seeing each other,

125
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,500
we should set some rules.

126
00:05:23,542 --> 00:05:25,458
Ground rules. Okay.
Yeah.

127
00:05:30,834 --> 00:05:33,291
First, your wife--
yeah.

128
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:37,041
--Is not allowed to speak to
Mason or be anywhere near him.

129
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,000
Charlotte should never
have done what she did,

130
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,125
but she's sorry.

131
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:43,625
She's actually very different
once you get to know her.

132
00:05:43,667 --> 00:05:45,625
No, thanks.
Secondly,

133
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:48,250
I don't want you telling Mason
that you're his father.

134
00:05:49,542 --> 00:05:51,709
Ever?
For now.

135
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,625
Okay. If you wanna see Mason,
those are my conditions.

136
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:03,083
Beautiful. All of this is
so beautiful.

137
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,834
The colors.
The textures.

138
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:12,709
Everything around us.
It's life on a canvas.

139
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,041
Hey, Wes. It's me.

140
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:23,834
It's Dr. Turner.
Do you remember me?

141
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:29,291
You're not Dr. Turner.
Yes. Yes, I am.

142
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:34,709
Listen to me, Wes.

143
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,792
Do you remember when we
started working together

144
00:06:36,834 --> 00:06:38,875
and you were living in a box
on venice beach?

145
00:06:38,917 --> 00:06:40,041
Do you remember that?

146
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,500
And I used to come
visit you

147
00:06:41,542 --> 00:06:44,291
and we would talk about
how you were feeling.

148
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:48,250
About the voices in your head,
the ones that frightened you.

149
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,625
You're not Dr. Turner.

150
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:52,291
Remember what happened
after that?

151
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,375
You started taking medication

152
00:06:54,417 --> 00:06:57,458
and you kept coming to see me
and you got better.

153
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,041
And you didn't live
in a box anymore.

154
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,959
You had an apartment.
You paid rent.

155
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:04,959
The apartment
on third street.

156
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,750
Yes, the apartment
on third street.

157
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:10,000
And you had a show
in the local art gallery.

158
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,291
People loved my paintings.
They did.

159
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,542
You made beautiful paintings.

160
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,875
Don't you wanna get back
to that?

161
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:27,834
You are not Dr. Turner.

162
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:30,625
Wes.
The machines got Dr. Turner.

163
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:33,667
The machines took over her mind.
They made her leave me.

164
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:35,041
Wes.
The real Dr. Turner

165
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:38,417
would never have left me.
You're a machine.

166
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,000
And I'm not talking
to you anymore.

167
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,875
Michelle is 30,
her cag count is 43.

168
00:07:49,917 --> 00:07:52,500
She should've had a couple more
years before symptoms started.

169
00:07:52,542 --> 00:07:53,542
How advanced are they?

170
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:56,125
Tremors, rigidity,
seizures.

171
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,041
The younger the onset,
the faster they progress.

172
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,250
It's a daunting prospect,

173
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:01,166
but there are support groups
and therapy.

174
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,709
And she'll still have time where
she's lucid and functional.

175
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,000
But she doesn't want the time,
does she?

176
00:08:10,792 --> 00:08:12,208
She wants me to euthanize her.

177
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,542
Your friend Michelle,
is she a puppy?

178
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,083
Because unless
she's a puppy--

179
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,500
I promised her I would.

180
00:08:23,542 --> 00:08:26,166
It was the only way I could
stop her from killing herself

181
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,208
when she found out
she had the huntington's gene.

182
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,375
Wait, Amelia.

183
00:08:29,417 --> 00:08:31,041
The puppy thing
is kind of a good point.

184
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,125
Why are we more humane
in our treatment of animals--?

185
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,083
You're not considering this?
He did it.

186
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,500
Okay, okay, okay.

187
00:08:36,542 --> 00:08:38,041
One, when I tell you something,

188
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,542
just keep it to yourself,
okay?

189
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,041
And two,

190
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:44,125
my patient was in his seventies.
He was in excruciating pain

191
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:45,875
and he only had
a couple of weeks to live.

192
00:08:45,917 --> 00:08:48,458
What if you were seizing and
losing control of your muscles,

193
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,750
of your bowels,
of your mind?

194
00:08:49,792 --> 00:08:52,208
Would you want to stick around
for that?

195
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,959
You took an oath.

196
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,458
You think I would do less harm

197
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,625
by letting her die slowly
and painfully?

198
00:08:58,667 --> 00:09:00,667
I know you're sad.
I know you're scared,

199
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:02,542
I know you wanna help
your friend.

200
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,583
This is not how to do it.

201
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,667
Physician-assisted suicide
is legal

202
00:09:05,709 --> 00:09:07,542
in Washington
and in Oregon--

203
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,625
but in California,
we're talking about murder.

204
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:11,041
You got that, right?

205
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,208
You're talking
about committing a murder.

206
00:09:23,542 --> 00:09:25,041
I got one. What do I do?
What?

207
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,625
- What? Wait.
- Oh, reel it in.

208
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:28,083
Reel it in.

209
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,041
There you go. Nice and steady.
Oh, my god.

210
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,166
- Mason, you really got one.
- Steady.

211
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,792
- Yeah.
- There you go.

212
00:09:33,834 --> 00:09:36,291
Bring it up. Bring it up.
Yes.

213
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,458
Yeah.

214
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,667
Yeah.
Ha-ha-ha.

215
00:09:40,834 --> 00:09:42,458
Good job, man.

216
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,875
Check that out.
Look at that, man.

217
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:47,792
I'm hungry.
You want a hot dog?

218
00:09:47,834 --> 00:09:49,041
Sure.

219
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,709
Hot dog? Ha-ha-ha.
No thanks.

220
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,166
You're pretty good.
You wanna go again?

221
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:01,542
Are you dating my mom?

222
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:02,834
No, we're just friends.

223
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,333
Well, whenever my mom

224
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,041
has a friend that's a guy,

225
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,667
it usually means
that he's her boyfriend.

226
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:11,041
And her boyfriends
are kind of dumb.

227
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:14,709
Oh, well, it's a good thing
I'm not her boyfriend then, huh?

228
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,625
I mean, do you think
a dumb boyfriend

229
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:19,583
could do like this?

230
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,875
If it's all right,
I kind of wanna go find my mom.

231
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:27,625
Okay. Go ahead.

232
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:36,792
Hey.
Hey.

233
00:10:36,834 --> 00:10:38,750
So did you hear about
my former patient?

234
00:10:38,792 --> 00:10:41,166
My schizophrenic patient, Wes,
who because I was suspended

235
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,458
and forced to stop seeing him,
has stopped taking meds.

236
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,583
And is living
on the streets

237
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,458
talking to traffic lights.
I heard.

238
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,041
It's not okay.
It's not okay.

239
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,083
Okay.
I'm thinking about suing.

240
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,667
You're gonna sue a homeless guy?
The medical board.

241
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:55,291
And if I can't sue,
then I am gonna go to the press

242
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:58,041
and I am gonna bring attention
to this system.

243
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,041
To this process
that is so broken,

244
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,333
I don't even know
where to start fixing it.

245
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:03,959
Okay, are you angry at me?

246
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,542
Because you're actually
yelling at me.

247
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:08,125
No. Oh, no, Addison.
I just--

248
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,500
ever since Pete's
heart attack,

249
00:11:09,542 --> 00:11:11,625
I feel like I've been trying
to be the perfect wife

250
00:11:11,667 --> 00:11:14,417
and mother and not a doctor.

251
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:17,375
I haven't let myself realize
the effect that my suspension

252
00:11:17,417 --> 00:11:20,500
has had on my patients
whom I just abandoned.

253
00:11:20,542 --> 00:11:22,166
You didn't completely
abandon them.

254
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,208
No, I did. I did.

255
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,500
That's how it feels
to them.

256
00:11:24,542 --> 00:11:25,542
And it sucks.

257
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:32,041
Nai used to put food
on top of feelings.

258
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,333
Addison, I'm a therapist.

259
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,667
I don't eat for comfort.
That's not healthy.

260
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:36,792
It's disordered eating.

261
00:11:36,834 --> 00:11:38,500
Try a doughnut hole.
They help.

262
00:11:44,834 --> 00:11:46,208
They're good, right?

263
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:51,125
Hey. I got an idea about Wes.
You got a moment?

264
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:54,000
Yeah. I have nothing but.
How you doing? You good?

265
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm great.
I have doughnut holes.

266
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,458
Oh.

267
00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:04,250
You wanna lock my son up?
Not exactly.

268
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,166
We just wanna keep him
in a psych hold.

269
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:09,041
Because of Wes' pattern
of destructive behavior,

270
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,875
severe delusions
which result in him

271
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:12,208
not taking
his heart medication--

272
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,792
he could die.

273
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:15,625
We think we could get a judge
to sign off on the hold.

274
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:18,625
I had him committed before,
Dr. Turner. It makes it worse.

275
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:21,041
Being held down
and being strait-jacketed?

276
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,625
His paranoia
goes off the charts.

277
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:24,041
And then
when he goes off his meds,

278
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:27,375
which he always eventually does,
he trusts me less.

279
00:12:27,417 --> 00:12:30,583
I need him to trust me.
I'm his mom.

280
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,834
The only way I can be there for
him at all is if he trusts me.

281
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:38,208
I... I can't have him
committed.

282
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:43,500
I mean, he's still my boy.
He's in there.

283
00:12:43,542 --> 00:12:46,041
He's somewhere in there.
You know, in the cracks.

284
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,917
In the moments
where those voices get quiet,

285
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:50,959
he's my wonderful,
wonderful boy.

286
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:58,500
I won't allow you to hold Wes
against his will.

287
00:12:58,542 --> 00:13:01,041
And if you pursue this,

288
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,458
I will fight you.

289
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:16,625
How did you do it?

290
00:13:20,542 --> 00:13:21,709
Morphine.

291
00:13:22,542 --> 00:13:24,500
My patient was halfway there
on a cocktail

292
00:13:24,542 --> 00:13:25,709
of sedatives
and sleeping pills,

293
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,750
so it didn't take much.

294
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:29,291
What happened?

295
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,959
After you gave him
the drugs?

296
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,333
Well, at first
he was ecstatic.

297
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:37,709
Maybe because he was free
from the pain.

298
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,125
But after his body started
to shut down,

299
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:45,041
well, there was so much fear.

300
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,125
He said
it was what he wanted,

301
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,750
but I don't think
he was prepared for the...

302
00:13:49,792 --> 00:13:52,834
How terrifying
and lonely it was.

303
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,709
And what did you do?

304
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,041
I stayed with him
till it was over.

305
00:13:59,792 --> 00:14:02,542
It takes
an emotional toll on you.

306
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,125
Sometimes I wonder
if I gave him the morphine

307
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,750
because I was the one
who couldn't take it anymore.

308
00:14:09,792 --> 00:14:12,500
That if I had been
stronger for him,

309
00:14:12,542 --> 00:14:16,041
maybe he would've died in his
sleep, without any of that

310
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:21,041
regret or despair.

311
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:24,000
If you knew then
how you would feel now,

312
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,583
would it have stopped you?

313
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:31,166
No. But that was different.

314
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,834
And no matter
what Michelle says,

315
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:36,041
she has no idea what it's really
like to face death, believe me.

316
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:42,208
It's not gentle or sweet
or a relief.

317
00:14:43,792 --> 00:14:44,667
I gave her my word.

318
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:46,667
Then take it back.

319
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:48,750
Take back your word

320
00:14:48,792 --> 00:14:52,041
before you ruin your life
and your career.

321
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,041
Take it back.

322
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,208
So have you seen
Amelia?

323
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,667
I don't have her on GPS.

324
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:08,875
I'm just worried.

325
00:15:08,917 --> 00:15:10,041
So am I.

326
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,500
You don't think
she would actually--?

327
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:13,917
I don't know.
I don't...

328
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:16,500
I'm sick. I'm actually
worried a little sick.

329
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:18,583
I mean,
physically nauseous.

330
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:21,041
But I'm not her shrink,
I'm not her father.

331
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,041
That's the way you feel
about her? Fatherly?

332
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,041
You two have been spending
a lot of time together.

333
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,542
I don't know. I don't know
what I'm feeling. Except sick.

334
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:28,750
Hey.
Hey.

335
00:15:28,792 --> 00:15:30,917
How was fishing with the kid?
It was good.

336
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,542
He'd never been before, he did
great. He caught two fish.

337
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,083
Which he couldn't care
less about.

338
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,750
No, it wasn't good.
It was awkward.

339
00:15:37,792 --> 00:15:39,417
It was weird and awkward,

340
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:43,333
and it was like he didn't wanna
have anything to do with me

341
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,583
and I just don't get it.

342
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,709
Hi.
Hey.

343
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,709
Hey.
Hey.

344
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,542
What now?

345
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:58,583
Mason and I were getting
along great, until--

346
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,792
until what?

347
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:01,959
If you're having an issue
with him,

348
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,375
it has nothing to do
with me.

349
00:16:03,417 --> 00:16:06,041
I only talked to the mother.
We hung out and it was awkward

350
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,000
and it never was before.
If Erica hates you,

351
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:11,542
or us, that is gonna
influence Mason.

352
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:14,041
Coop, I understand you're going
through a rough patch.

353
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,083
If you think you can blame me
because an 8-year-old

354
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,875
doesn't want to share
a corn dog with you,

355
00:16:17,917 --> 00:16:20,000
you have another thing
coming.

356
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,625
Son of a bitch.

357
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:33,041
Excuse me.

358
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,041
Hey. Is everything okay?

359
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,750
No, I'm very definitely
not okay.

360
00:16:37,792 --> 00:16:41,041
If you try to do one thing,
one simple thing,

361
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,625
like rename the practice
and suddenly,

362
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:45,625
I'm in a blizzard of paperwork,
you know?

363
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:47,750
I got the building
management people,

364
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:49,041
I've got
the insurance company.

365
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,709
Oh, I've even got the guy

366
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:54,583
who paints our damn
parking spaces.

367
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:57,542
This is not
what I signed up for.

368
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,083
Heavy is the head.

369
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,667
Seriously?
Are you trying to piss me off?

370
00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:07,583
Because I'm looking for someone,
anyone, whose face I can just--

371
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:12,041
it's not your fault.
I'm sorry.

372
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,875
You have massive doses
of hormones

373
00:17:13,917 --> 00:17:15,041
coursing
through your veins,

374
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,792
your emotions are elevated,

375
00:17:16,834 --> 00:17:18,041
your filter is gone.

376
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,875
You feel like you've been hit
by a pms truck.

377
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:21,750
No kidding.
How do I make this stop?

378
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:23,208
Just breathe, okay?

379
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,625
And if you start to feel
like you wanna cry or scream

380
00:17:25,667 --> 00:17:28,542
or rip somebody's face off,
walk away.

381
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:31,417
Go someplace quiet.
Avoid emotional triggers, like--

382
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,041
Sam.
Hey.

383
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,208
Hey.
What's going on?

384
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,458
Just giving Addison
a pep talk

385
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,041
on how to get
through paperwork.

386
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:39,166
Hang in there.

387
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,500
You okay?
Yeah.

388
00:17:41,542 --> 00:17:45,500
Sweetie, I'm right there
with you.

389
00:17:45,542 --> 00:17:49,458
Ugh. I hate this thing
that's going on with Wes.

390
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,834
I feel so bad for his mother.
I feel bad for my moth--

391
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,834
I feel bad for all mothers
everywhere.

392
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,208
Did you know that Wes
was a perfectly normal kid

393
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,041
up until
he was Maya's age?

394
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:02,208
So you're worried
that Maya might have, um,

395
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,375
a schizophrenic break?

396
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:04,709
Yes, I am.

397
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,625
And I'm worried about
a million other things

398
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:10,500
because my baby girl's
living in New York City.

399
00:18:10,542 --> 00:18:11,625
She's a blessing.

400
00:18:11,667 --> 00:18:15,750
Maya is the biggest blessing
of my life,

401
00:18:15,792 --> 00:18:17,208
but sometimes,
I don't know...

402
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:21,333
Sometimes I just wonder
if not having the burden,

403
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:24,041
of the fear and the stress
of having a child,

404
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:27,000
maybe that's a blessing too.

405
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,250
You know what I mean?
Addie, where are you going?

406
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:35,500
Going for a walk.
Addie.

407
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,375
Addie.

408
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:40,709
Yeah, this is Dr. Bennett.

409
00:18:42,792 --> 00:18:44,792
Okay. I'll be right there.

410
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:50,875
So, what happens
after I'm gone?

411
00:18:50,917 --> 00:18:52,792
I call the police.

412
00:18:52,834 --> 00:18:54,709
I tell them I found you.

413
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,583
And they'll think
I took pills?

414
00:19:07,709 --> 00:19:10,083
Hold this.

415
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,125
Put some fingerprints on it.

416
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,041
Should I just take
the pills?

417
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:19,125
You could end up
in an irreversible coma

418
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,667
or with just really bad
liver damage.

419
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,542
I don't want to get you
in trouble.

420
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,000
I don't want you
to suffer.

421
00:19:52,917 --> 00:19:57,375
First, I'll inject a benzo
to relax you.

422
00:19:57,417 --> 00:19:59,792
Then a barbiturate.

423
00:19:59,834 --> 00:20:01,458
It'll put you under.

424
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:06,000
And finally,
potassium chloride.

425
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,792
It'll stop your heart.

426
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,291
Okay. I'm ready.

427
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:56,000
Thank you.

428
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:38,709
I love you.

429
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,792
I know.

430
00:21:45,792 --> 00:21:47,792
If you see my dad,

431
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:51,583
you tell him I said hi,
okay?

432
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:55,709
Maybe I'll fix him up
with my mom.

433
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,083
Why can't I breathe?

434
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:23,625
You could be having
an adverse reaction.

435
00:22:23,667 --> 00:22:25,208
I'm gonna keep going,
okay?

436
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:28,333
This barbiturate will depress
your central nervous system.

437
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:30,041
Amelia.

438
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:31,583
Should I keep going
or should I stop?

439
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:33,041
I don't know what that means.

440
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:34,709
Stop.
Okay.

441
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,041
Okay, I'm stopping.

442
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:37,125
It's okay, Michelle.

443
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:39,041
I'm gonna call 911.
Michelle?

444
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:41,417
It's okay. Michelle,
it's okay. I'm stopping.

445
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:48,542
No. Get away from me.

446
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:50,041
He had a psychotic episode

447
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:51,333
and collapsed on the street.

448
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:52,583
His mom called it in.

449
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:55,875
He was upset. He was ranting
at a kid on his cell phone

450
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:57,125
and then he just dropped.

451
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:58,875
They'll take over.
Can I get help?

452
00:22:58,917 --> 00:23:00,875
Okay, he's got
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

453
00:23:00,917 --> 00:23:03,041
It's gone unmedicated.
Probably arrhythmia.

454
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:04,834
He came in the ambulance.

455
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:07,792
Thinks the EKG and every other
machine was trying to kill him.

456
00:23:07,834 --> 00:23:09,959
Can't you hear?
Can't you hear it?

457
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,792
They're trying to send signals
into our brain.

458
00:23:11,834 --> 00:23:15,375
Let's 51, 50 him and 5
milligrams of haloperidol iv.

459
00:23:15,417 --> 00:23:17,667
- You gotta trust me.
- You're not my friend.

460
00:23:17,709 --> 00:23:19,041
You're trying to poison me!

461
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:21,208
Sweetie,
please let the doctors help you.

462
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,291
What are you doing to him?

463
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:24,041
Gonna put him on a psych hold.

464
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:27,625
Mom. Mom, make them stop.
Make them stop.

465
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:29,458
Don't let the machines
get me!

466
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,875
Haloperidol, 10 milligrams.
Stop! You're hurting him!

467
00:23:31,917 --> 00:23:34,375
- Get her out of here.
- No!

468
00:23:34,417 --> 00:23:35,625
All right.

469
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:38,834
Mom! Mom! Mom, don't leave me!

470
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:42,417
Don't let them
do this to me! Mom!

471
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:44,667
It's respiratory distress.
Secondary to benzo.

472
00:23:44,709 --> 00:23:47,542
Okay, I need point two
milligrams of flumazenil iv.

473
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:49,750
And 02 at 6 liters.
She got a hold of drugs, Pete.

474
00:23:49,792 --> 00:23:52,792
I don't know how. She did
this herself. I found her--

475
00:23:54,542 --> 00:23:56,291
she changed her mind.

476
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:58,041
She had a bad reaction
and she changed her mind.

477
00:23:58,083 --> 00:24:00,041
Pull an intubation tray.
Let me help.

478
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:01,583
No, Amelia,
it's time to step back.

479
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:02,917
Please, Pete.

480
00:24:02,959 --> 00:24:04,625
Amelia, it's time to go.
Go to the waiting room.

481
00:24:04,667 --> 00:24:06,583
I'll keep you updated.

482
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:58,083
So I've gotten to know
all of the guys here,

483
00:24:58,125 --> 00:25:00,667
but you women are harder
to crack. You're like a coven.

484
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:03,375
Oh, god.

485
00:25:03,417 --> 00:25:05,041
It's just the hormones.

486
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:06,375
Don't even pay
attention to me.

487
00:25:06,417 --> 00:25:09,000
I'm just being ridiculous.

488
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:10,709
I've heard that before.

489
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:14,166
I feel like my brain is broken.
And that.

490
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:16,166
I hate my boyfriend.
Heard that the most.

491
00:25:16,208 --> 00:25:18,625
Do you know he basically said
it's a blessing

492
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:19,959
that I can't have children?

493
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,500
Doesn't sound like Sam.

494
00:25:21,542 --> 00:25:23,166
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
That's what he said.

495
00:25:23,208 --> 00:25:25,875
"It's a blessing."
A blessing. Really?

496
00:25:25,917 --> 00:25:27,750
For whom is it a blessing?
Him?

497
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:29,458
Is that the only reason
that he's with me?

498
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,041
He thinks
I'll never get pregnant?

499
00:25:31,083 --> 00:25:32,166
Because I prefer to think

500
00:25:32,208 --> 00:25:33,834
that it's because
I'm awesome in the sack.

501
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:35,458
Addison. Addison,
listen to me. Okay?

502
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,041
I can't get myself zipped.

503
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:38,834
You're brave to do this,
okay?

504
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:41,041
It's a brave and wonderful thing
you're trying to do.

505
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:43,000
And all of the thoughts
and tears

506
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:46,417
and
"I hate my boyfriend" talk

507
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:48,375
is just the hormones, okay?

508
00:25:48,417 --> 00:25:50,750
But the fact of the matter is
you cannot do this alone.

509
00:25:50,792 --> 00:25:53,041
Of course I can.
Lots of women do.

510
00:25:53,083 --> 00:25:54,834
No, they don't.
Even single women.

511
00:25:54,875 --> 00:25:57,041
They have friends and family
and book clubs.

512
00:25:57,083 --> 00:25:59,417
You're afraid to tell

513
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:02,041
because you're trying to keep it
secret from your boyfriend.

514
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:03,583
What are you gonna
tell Sam

515
00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:05,083
if you get pregnant?

516
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:06,625
Or when you're
six months along?

517
00:26:06,667 --> 00:26:08,041
What are you gonna do
when the baby comes?

518
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:09,250
Hide it
in the liquor cabinet?

519
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:11,417
I've seen the road
you're heading down,

520
00:26:11,458 --> 00:26:13,041
and you're not gonna make it

521
00:26:13,083 --> 00:26:15,625
unless you have people
on your team.

522
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:24,792
Hey.
Hi.

523
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:27,875
Um, this isn't gonna--
I have to cancel.

524
00:26:27,917 --> 00:26:29,875
I'm sorry about
the late notice.

525
00:26:29,917 --> 00:26:33,041
What? Wait. Why? Why?
He had a meltdown.

526
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:35,500
Ten minutes ago.
Sorry I didn't call you sooner,

527
00:26:35,542 --> 00:26:37,917
but I was kind of busy trying
to talk him out of his bedroom.

528
00:26:37,959 --> 00:26:39,834
It's not me.

529
00:26:39,875 --> 00:26:41,750
Mason doesn't want
to spend time with you.

530
00:26:43,375 --> 00:26:45,041
Oh.

531
00:26:45,083 --> 00:26:46,083
Did he say why?

532
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:48,959
He's 8, who knows why?

533
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,500
But if he doesn't want to
spend time with you,

534
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:51,917
I can't force him.

535
00:26:51,959 --> 00:26:54,000
Maybe that would change
if he knew I was his father?

536
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:57,500
You say you want to be a dad,
but are you ready?

537
00:26:57,542 --> 00:26:59,750
I mean, I'm not talking
about buying him stuff

538
00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:01,583
or pulling a quarter
out of his ear.

539
00:27:01,625 --> 00:27:03,208
I'm talking about
have you thought about

540
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,250
making room in your life
for him?

541
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:08,542
Or your home? Have you talked
to your bitch of a wife about--

542
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:09,750
don't call her that.

543
00:27:09,792 --> 00:27:11,542
--How fatherhood
would change your lives?

544
00:27:11,583 --> 00:27:12,917
Yes, I have.
I really have.

545
00:27:12,959 --> 00:27:14,083
I get that
she scared you off.

546
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:15,709
I get that you think
that she's awful

547
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,667
and I must be awful
if i' married to her,

548
00:27:17,709 --> 00:27:18,917
but you really
don't know her.

549
00:27:18,959 --> 00:27:21,250
She's like a mama bear
when she's threatened,

550
00:27:21,291 --> 00:27:22,375
and you threatened her.

551
00:27:22,417 --> 00:27:24,542
Or she thought
you were threatening me,

552
00:27:24,583 --> 00:27:29,917
and so she, you know,
growled loudly and...

553
00:27:29,959 --> 00:27:31,375
Okay, the metaphor
wears thin,

554
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:33,542
but my point is
my wife loves me,

555
00:27:33,583 --> 00:27:36,417
and so she will love Mason
because I love him.

556
00:27:37,542 --> 00:27:40,041
He's my son.
And I love him.

557
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:42,166
And you were the one
who showed up in my life

558
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:45,041
to tell me that he exists
and I'm glad you did.

559
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:46,917
And maybe you wish
you could take that back now,

560
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:48,208
but you can't.

561
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,709
You wanted Mason
to have a father?

562
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,166
Now he does.

563
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:55,417
Now he does.

564
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:03,583
Hey. Have you seen Amelia?
Hey.

565
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:07,375
You okay?

566
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:12,750
You're worried about him.

567
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:14,041
Yeah, I'm just waiting
for Sam or anyone

568
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:16,834
to come and update me because
I'm not allowed in his room.

569
00:28:16,875 --> 00:28:20,041
That new lawyer is working
overtime to re-open my case,

570
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:22,625
so I am following the letter
of the law.

571
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:25,041
No contact
with my former patients,

572
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:27,458
but, um, yeah,
I'm worried about him.

573
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,583
I'm worried about
all of them.

574
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:31,667
It's gonna be okay,
Violet.

575
00:28:33,625 --> 00:28:35,458
How?
I don't know.

576
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,250
I don't know how,
I just...

577
00:28:39,709 --> 00:28:41,041
This is my favorite thing
about you.

578
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:42,625
When I get the crazy eyes?

579
00:28:42,667 --> 00:28:44,875
No. That--
that's pretty cute too,

580
00:28:44,917 --> 00:28:46,083
but my favorite thing
about you

581
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:47,792
is how much you care
about your patients.

582
00:28:47,834 --> 00:28:51,208
I'm glad
you're fighting the board.

583
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:54,041
I'm glad you're remembering
things you like about me.

584
00:29:01,792 --> 00:29:03,250
Amelia!

585
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:08,041
Amelia, open the door. I know
you're in there. I saw your car.

586
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:11,583
Amelia, open the door because
I'm not leaving until you do.

587
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:13,000
Amelia!

588
00:29:24,959 --> 00:29:26,542
Are you crazy?

589
00:29:26,583 --> 00:29:28,667
Are you actually
clinically insane?

590
00:29:28,709 --> 00:29:29,834
Did you really
do this thing?

591
00:29:29,875 --> 00:29:31,750
Because even I didn't think
you were stupid enough

592
00:29:31,792 --> 00:29:33,709
and crazy enough
to actually go through with it!

593
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,834
Do you get that you basically
confessed your crime to me

594
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:38,250
before you did it?

595
00:29:38,291 --> 00:29:40,542
Do you get that I could
and should call the police?

596
00:29:40,583 --> 00:29:43,417
And if that woman had died,
I would call the police.

597
00:29:43,458 --> 00:29:46,041
Because I am not gonna be
an accessory to murder.

598
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:47,667
What is wrong with you?

599
00:29:47,709 --> 00:29:49,500
Why are you
this self-destructive?

600
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,750
She didn't die?

601
00:29:56,083 --> 00:29:57,709
She's alive?

602
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,792
Yes.

603
00:29:59,834 --> 00:30:01,583
She's alive.

604
00:30:30,834 --> 00:30:32,709
You ready to go?

605
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,041
Yeah.

606
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:38,959
I got you.

607
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,375
You okay?

608
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:43,750
I'm sorry.

609
00:30:43,792 --> 00:30:45,041
I am so sorry.

610
00:30:45,083 --> 00:30:48,709
Do not apologize to me.
I mean it.

611
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:49,959
I was so sure
that I wanted to die,

612
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,917
but now I don't--
I don't know.

613
00:30:51,959 --> 00:30:54,959
I just-- I don't know
if I panicked or--

614
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,959
hey, you don't have to
figure it out today.

615
00:30:57,041 --> 00:30:59,250
Or tomorrow for that matter.

616
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:02,625
I know it's not easy
being alone.

617
00:31:02,667 --> 00:31:05,709
Your mom had you
and you--

618
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:10,000
you have me.
I will be there the whole way.

619
00:31:10,041 --> 00:31:11,458
You can even move in
if you want.

620
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,750
Oh, I couldn't do that
to you.

621
00:31:12,792 --> 00:31:14,125
You'd be helping me too.

622
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:15,583
I know it doesn't compare

623
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:18,458
to what you're going through,

624
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,041
but I struggle too.
Every day.

625
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:24,375
Pills?
Booze.

626
00:31:24,417 --> 00:31:27,000
I'm branching out.

627
00:31:28,208 --> 00:31:31,333
I didn't know.
I'm sorry.

628
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:33,375
You don't have to be sorry.

629
00:31:33,417 --> 00:31:35,041
So we're both screwed up,

630
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:37,417
but maybe we can be there
for each other.

631
00:31:37,458 --> 00:31:38,792
Like some kind of--

632
00:31:38,834 --> 00:31:40,709
like some kind of messed up
buddy system.

633
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:43,625
You know, I won't drink today
if you don't kill yourself.

634
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:49,458
Deal?

635
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,000
Deal.

636
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:03,875
We got his heart stabilized.
For now.

637
00:32:03,917 --> 00:32:05,375
How are you doing there,
Wes?

638
00:32:05,417 --> 00:32:06,667
He can't hear you.

639
00:32:06,709 --> 00:32:08,542
Not when he's like this.

640
00:32:08,583 --> 00:32:10,917
That's why he never could stay
on his meds.

641
00:32:10,959 --> 00:32:14,333
He said they made him feel like
he was 10 feet underwater.

642
00:32:14,375 --> 00:32:16,709
Working with Dr. Turner helped,

643
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:19,333
but I knew
it was just a matter of time.

644
00:32:20,542 --> 00:32:23,750
We should talk about
other options for Wes.

645
00:32:23,792 --> 00:32:25,500
What to do next.

646
00:32:25,542 --> 00:32:28,500
I think that you should legally
petition for a conservatorship.

647
00:32:28,542 --> 00:32:31,041
You'll be able to make
all of Wes' medical decisions.

648
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:33,083
Place him in a facility
for his own safety.

649
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:34,959
We already
went through this.

650
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,250
Hear me out.

651
00:32:36,291 --> 00:32:38,709
I'm not talking about
a temporary psych hold here.

652
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,750
I'm talking about something--
I said no.

653
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,709
I'm not gonna put my son
in some clinic

654
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:45,125
where they keep him locked
and drugged.

655
00:32:45,166 --> 00:32:47,500
I won't do that to him.

656
00:32:51,709 --> 00:32:56,041
Uh, my sister,
Corinne.

657
00:32:56,083 --> 00:32:58,083
She was a lot like Wes.

658
00:32:58,125 --> 00:33:00,834
She made a habit
of disappearing too.

659
00:33:00,875 --> 00:33:04,458
My mother would do everything
she could to keep her home,

660
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,500
but Corinne
would always find a way out.

661
00:33:08,542 --> 00:33:11,041
One day, she left

662
00:33:11,083 --> 00:33:12,417
and she never came back.

663
00:33:13,583 --> 00:33:15,000
That was a long time ago.

664
00:33:15,041 --> 00:33:18,792
I still don't know
if she's dead or alive.

665
00:33:18,834 --> 00:33:20,500
But I do know

666
00:33:20,542 --> 00:33:22,583
that my mother's
never been the same.

667
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:26,000
I've never been the same.

668
00:33:28,083 --> 00:33:29,417
I know that you love Wes,

669
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:32,125
and that you respect
his right to be free.

670
00:33:32,166 --> 00:33:37,500
But are you prepared for the day
that he walks out of your life

671
00:33:37,542 --> 00:33:38,917
and disappears forever?

672
00:33:38,959 --> 00:33:40,667
I don't...

673
00:33:41,959 --> 00:33:45,375
My son is an artist.

674
00:33:45,417 --> 00:33:47,041
He's a thinker.

675
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:52,583
He's funny and sharp
and he's passionate.

676
00:33:54,792 --> 00:33:56,583
Do you see that man,
Dr. Bennett?

677
00:33:57,917 --> 00:34:00,750
Do you see my son in this bed?

678
00:34:00,792 --> 00:34:03,041
If I keep him like this,

679
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:06,000
then he's already disappeared.

680
00:34:22,834 --> 00:34:25,083
Carlos, Carlos,
you have to leave.

681
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:27,041
My boyfriend's
gonna be home soon.

682
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:29,208
Carlos?
Heh, heh.

683
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:33,041
You know-- you know I have a
soft spot for the Latin lovers.

684
00:34:33,083 --> 00:34:34,500
You better watch it.
Oh!

685
00:34:34,542 --> 00:34:36,959
What's the matter?
What happened?

686
00:34:38,834 --> 00:34:40,291
What's up?

687
00:34:41,667 --> 00:34:44,041
I started...

688
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:48,166
I started ivf treatments
a couple of days ago.

689
00:34:48,208 --> 00:34:50,917
I am sore.

690
00:34:50,959 --> 00:34:52,041
Ivf.

691
00:34:52,083 --> 00:34:54,542
Jake's been giving them
to me.

692
00:34:54,583 --> 00:34:55,542
Jake?
Yeah,

693
00:34:55,583 --> 00:34:57,959
Jake's the only one
who knows.

694
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,417
I didn't want the entire office
gossiping about it.

695
00:35:01,458 --> 00:35:02,500
I'm sorry.

696
00:35:02,542 --> 00:35:05,417
No, no. It's okay.

697
00:35:05,458 --> 00:35:06,667
Huh.

698
00:35:07,625 --> 00:35:09,083
Um...

699
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,125
I don't want to have
another kid,

700
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:16,083
because I already
got mine through.

701
00:35:16,125 --> 00:35:18,959
What?
No, I was

702
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,625
terrified every single day

703
00:35:20,667 --> 00:35:24,458
of Maya's childhood,
but I got her through.

704
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:27,041
I mean, it was--
it was wonderful

705
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,792
and it was terrible.
Both equal parts.

706
00:35:28,834 --> 00:35:31,041
And it's definitely an
experience that you should have

707
00:35:31,083 --> 00:35:34,542
if that's what you want,
but...

708
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:38,250
I just don't know if
I have it in me to do it again.

709
00:35:38,291 --> 00:35:41,458
But that doesn't mean

710
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,041
that I don't support you.

711
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:46,750
That doesn't mean
that I don't love you.

712
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,417
And it doesn't mean that you
get to keep secrets from me.

713
00:35:55,583 --> 00:35:57,750
Okay?

714
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Okay.

715
00:36:05,625 --> 00:36:07,625
Hands off the ass.

716
00:36:07,667 --> 00:36:10,250
I'm sorry.

717
00:36:14,333 --> 00:36:18,709
Michelle! Get in here!
We're doing girls night in.

718
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:23,500
I got rocky road and a DVD
of the second twilight movie.

719
00:36:23,542 --> 00:36:26,000
The one with
all the hot werewolves.

720
00:36:26,041 --> 00:36:27,583
Michelle?

721
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:54,000
She had a degenerative disease
that was progressing rapidly.

722
00:36:55,667 --> 00:36:58,000
It was painful
and she was taking oxycontin.

723
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:02,041
Those bottles hold 30 pills.

724
00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:04,041
I found a bunch
on the bed beside her.

725
00:37:04,083 --> 00:37:07,083
If she got half of them down,
she didn't last long.

726
00:37:08,709 --> 00:37:10,834
You all right,
Dr. Shepherd?

727
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:13,500
You have someone
you can call?

728
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:16,667
I'm all right.

729
00:37:16,709 --> 00:37:19,583
You're sure?
No.

730
00:37:19,625 --> 00:37:22,583
I miss my friend.

731
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:25,500
So I'm not all right.

732
00:37:27,625 --> 00:37:29,917
But I will be.

733
00:37:34,041 --> 00:37:36,417
I'll be fine.

734
00:37:36,458 --> 00:37:37,667
All right.

735
00:38:02,792 --> 00:38:06,458
Are you sure you won't ride
in a taxi with me?

736
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:11,709
Cars aren't safe, mom.
Please don't ride in cars.

737
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,834
The night sky is much better
for you than cars.

738
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:16,500
Okay, honey.

739
00:38:17,709 --> 00:38:19,709
You're gonna need
some money.

740
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:21,542
Okay.

741
00:38:21,583 --> 00:38:23,041
Okay.

742
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:26,750
And I want you to have
my phone number

743
00:38:26,792 --> 00:38:29,000
and not lose it.

744
00:38:33,834 --> 00:38:36,709
Thanks for saving me.

745
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:39,083
You're my hero.

746
00:38:41,583 --> 00:38:43,917
You're mine.

747
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:06,125
You're still here.

748
00:39:06,166 --> 00:39:07,709
Yeah.

749
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:09,000
I thought
you might need a ride.

750
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,667
Thank you.

751
00:39:26,291 --> 00:39:27,583
I'll be in the kitchen
if you need me.

752
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:30,625
Okay, thanks for this.

753
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:32,709
Hey, Mason.

754
00:39:34,667 --> 00:39:37,500
So, uh, I had fun yesterday.

755
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:43,250
And I'd love to, you know,
keep hanging out if...

756
00:39:43,291 --> 00:39:45,750
If you don't like fishing,

757
00:39:45,792 --> 00:39:47,375
we can do something else,
you know?

758
00:39:47,417 --> 00:39:49,375
Whatever you want,
really.

759
00:39:49,417 --> 00:39:52,041
Uh...

760
00:39:52,083 --> 00:39:54,417
Are you my dad?

761
00:39:57,083 --> 00:39:58,792
I'm pretty sure you are.

762
00:39:58,834 --> 00:40:00,375
I look like you.

763
00:40:00,417 --> 00:40:03,542
And mom acts weird
when she talks about you.

764
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:07,917
How do you feel about that?

765
00:40:07,959 --> 00:40:10,041
I don't know.

766
00:40:10,083 --> 00:40:14,917
But if you're not gonna be
around, like all the other guys,

767
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:16,250
we can't be friends.

768
00:40:22,417 --> 00:40:23,625
He's your dad, Mason.

769
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:29,875
I am your dad.

770
00:40:31,792 --> 00:40:33,750
And, uh...

771
00:40:35,583 --> 00:40:36,542
I'm not going anywhere.

772
00:40:43,959 --> 00:40:47,667
So you want to watch
some Phineas and ferb?

773
00:40:47,709 --> 00:40:49,959
It's good.

774
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,709
Yeah.

775
00:41:14,542 --> 00:41:16,250
Step one is the hardest.

776
00:41:16,291 --> 00:41:21,291
I mean, they say that
kind of about everything.

777
00:41:21,333 --> 00:41:25,041
You know, it's like
when you watch a baby

778
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:26,750
take her first step.

779
00:41:26,792 --> 00:41:30,041
I mean, she's spent days
and weeks and months

780
00:41:30,083 --> 00:41:34,458
literally teaching her muscles
how to function.

781
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,041
But once they do,
it's never that hard again.

782
00:41:37,083 --> 00:41:40,667
Okay.
You are all set.

783
00:41:45,542 --> 00:41:47,625
Do you want to be
my fertility doctor?

784
00:41:47,667 --> 00:41:50,542
I mean, mine's fine,
she's great.

785
00:41:50,583 --> 00:41:52,625
But you're clearly
the better choice for me.

786
00:41:52,667 --> 00:41:55,750
I mean, that's assuming
that you would still take me on.

787
00:41:55,792 --> 00:41:57,125
I wouldn't blame you
if you didn't--

788
00:41:57,166 --> 00:42:00,041
yes.

789
00:42:00,083 --> 00:42:02,375
So, what muscle did you train

790
00:42:02,417 --> 00:42:05,041
in order to take this step?

791
00:42:05,083 --> 00:42:08,000
You'll laugh.

792
00:42:08,041 --> 00:42:10,458
I won't.

793
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,792
Hope.

794
00:42:12,834 --> 00:42:15,750
I had to learn

795
00:42:15,792 --> 00:42:19,291
to let myself hope.
