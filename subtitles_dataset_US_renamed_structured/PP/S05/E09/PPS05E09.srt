It's the best thing

I'm Amelia Shepherd.

6
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:54,417
I'm checking in.

7
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:02,583
Amelia's mom,

8
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:04,583
she's as good as it gets.

9
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:07,041
She is as good
as a mother gets.

10
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:10,500
And it's hard to fathom that
you can do everything right,

11
00:01:10,542 --> 00:01:13,792
and you still can't control
what happens to your kid.

12
00:01:13,834 --> 00:01:16,709
They could still end up
in staggering amount of pain,

13
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:20,125
in rehab,
fighting for their life.

14
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:23,667
It's just hard to wrap
your head around

15

you might be pregnant.

00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:29,041
Your recovery experience...

17
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:30,542
Is our top priority.

18
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:32,834
We provide a positive
and a nurturing environment

19
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:35,291
as you embark
on your addiction treatment.

20
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:36,750
You'll start in the detox wing,
and then we'll move you

21
00:01:36,792 --> 00:01:38,291
to a regular room,

22
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:39,750
and you'll be assigned
a therapist

23
00:01:39,792 --> 00:01:42,709
separate from group therapy,
which means every afternoon.

24
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:46,875
Amelia?

25
00:01:48,792 --> 00:01:49,709

Amelia, can you hear me?

27
00:01:53,917 --> 00:01:56,542

Okay?

30
00:02:00,542 --> 00:02:02,000
And if you're hiding
any other drugs,

31
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,959
now would be a good time
to hand them over.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000

37
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:44,125
He said "pancake."

38
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:45,709
Pancake? Really?

39
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,000
Yeah.

40
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,792
Well, it actually sounded
more like "pa-Kay,"

41
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:50,417
but he was definitely
going for pancake.

42
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:51,917
Pancake.

43
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:53,208
Good job, pal.

44
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,250
Yeah.

46
00:02:57,959 --> 00:02:59,000
yeah.

47
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,917
We talk about Lucas.

48
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:07,792

53
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,792
Oh, we're doing great.

54
00:03:16,834 --> 00:03:18,625
Yeah, as long as we don't
talk about pregnancy

55
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:20,250
or anything baby related.

56
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,333
All right, will you make sure
and tell me as soon as you know

57
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,458

00:03:43,917 --> 00:03:45,667
When did
the stomach pain start?

68
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:47,041
Just after dinner.

69
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,792
A few hours later,
the night attendant reported

70
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:50,041
he developed a fever.

71
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,041
All right, Toby.

72
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,041
You're all done.
Let's get you dressed.

73
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,250

74
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:56,834
Okay, I'm gonna step outside,

75
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,500
talk to Mr. Davies
for a second.

76
00:04:00,667 --> 00:04:02,166
Why didn't you call me, Jim?

77
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,875
I mean, the group home's only
a few miles from my house.

78
00:04:03,917 --> 00:04:05,041
I could've
just come right over.

79
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,667
Come on, Cooper.

80
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:08,667
I have 43 other kids
just like Toby.

81
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:10,458
If I called a doctor every time
one of 'em sneezed...

82
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,083
Look...

83
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,458
I wish I could do more.

84
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,917
I've placed him in nine
different foster homes

85
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:17,041
in those four years.

86
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,875
Nobody wants a sick kid.

87
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:20,125
Little guy deserves better.

88
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:22,417
So he was diagnosed
with the lupus four years ago,

89
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:23,417
and that could explain

90
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:24,959
the abdominal pain
and the fever,

91
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,917
but I'm gonna have to do some
more tests just to make sure.

92
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:29,041
Dr. Freedman,
I don't feel too good.

93
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,041
Give me those tissues.
Come here.

94
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,917
Have a seat.
You have a bloody nose, Toby.

95
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,041
Lean forward.

96
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,333
Lean forward. Here.

97
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,542
Okay, just hold that.
This will stop it.

98
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:39,917
Let me see.

99
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,250
Oh. Okay, okay. You're okay.

100
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:45,917
You're gonna be okay.

101
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,041
Just say it.

102
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,000
Either way, just say it.

103
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,250

Look, I, uh, I know
you're a doctor,

107
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,959
but i'm--I'm still going to
give you the speech,

108
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,333
because even though you know
this stuff intellectually,

109
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,709
you need to process it
emotionally.

110
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,041
You don't have to give me
the speech.

111
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,959
I do. So here it goes.

112
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,917
Something like 6%
of women your age

113
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:29,041
get pregnant using I.V.F.,
okay?

114

It's a--it's a small number.

115

But between your commitment
and my experience,

116

we can--
we can make this happen.

I miss my best friend
every day.

183
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,041
She was...

184
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,125
Stupid.

185
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:13,000
We--
we were stupid together.

186
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:18,041
The boyfriend...

187
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,000
He was a bad influence.

188
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:24,041
Was Ryan a bad influence?

189
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:27,000
No. He was...

190
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,208
No, Ryan was...

191
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:33,291
I think I was
the bad influence.

192
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,291
Amelia.

193
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,166
You have a visitor
at reception.

194
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,750
Dr. Sheldon Wallace.

195
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:44,041
Could you tell him
that I'm busy?

196
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:45,041
Of course.

197
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,375
Thanks.

198
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:52,041
Who's Sheldon?

199
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,125
He's a friend.

200
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:56,166
Then why won't you
let him in?

201
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:58,166
I said some things.

202
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,041
I, uh...

203
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,208
I hurt some people.

204
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,166
But they still come
to visit you.

205
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,333
No one comes to visit me.

206
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:09,000
You should let
your friends in.

207
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,542
You're my friend.

208
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,375
I'm 18.

209
00:09:14,417 --> 00:09:17,208
So?

210
00:09:21,417 --> 00:09:24,291
Hey, is that one of those
h.D... Thingies?

211
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,375
If by "thingie," you mean
supercool camera, then yes.

212
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:30,458
I'm gonna shoot
Mason's school play.

213
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,625
- Aww.
- Which isn't for three weeks.

214
00:09:32,667 --> 00:09:35,291
Hopefully Spielberg here can get
the camera working by then.

215
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,458
I will figure it out.

216
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,709
You're just going
with the basic equipment?

217
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,000
You're not bringing a tripod
or a boom mic?

218
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,000
Oh.

219
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,208
Boom mic.

220
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,291
Oh, Cooper.

221
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,291
Hold on.

222
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,500
Oh, Cooper. Cooper,
I'm just kidding. Oh.

223
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,041
You know, a lot of women don't
get pregnant the first time.

224
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,959
I know. You have told me
many times.

225
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,250
And I'm gonna keep
telling you that

226
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,458
until you look a little less--

227
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,208
less what?

228
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,041
Miserable? Desperate?

229
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,333
I was gonna say wistful.

230
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,041
Oh.

231
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,250
God.

232
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:13,417
Yeah, I am.
I am... wistful.

233
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,041
No need for that.

234
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,667
Even if you don't want
to try again yourself,

235
00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:18,291
there are other ways
to make a family.

236
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,041
Hell, maybe you'll get lucky,

237
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,041
find out Sam knocked
someone up ten years ago.

238
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,583
I'm getting used
to the little rug rat.

239
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,709
Mm.

240
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,000
You sound surprised.

241
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,500
Well, it wasn't exactly
how I planned it.

242
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:31,458
Well, when is life ever?

243
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,458
The point is,

244
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,000
you have choices.

245
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:38,417
Not all of us
can say that.

246
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,291
So you think you'll do it?

247
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:42,917
I mean, try again?

248
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,333
I don't know.

249
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:45,542
Yeah. I think I am--

250
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,083
I am.

251
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,667
You know, Sam...

252
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:50,750
Had this look of relief

253
00:10:50,792 --> 00:10:52,750
when it didn't take
the first time.

254
00:10:52,792 --> 00:10:54,750
Pete looks relieved
every time I leave the house.

255
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:56,208
Doesn't stop me
from coming home.

256
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,041
Wow.

257
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,041
That is dark.

258
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:04,041
Are you aware
of how dark that sounds?

259
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,333
For some reason, I'm vaguely
comfortable with the dark.

260
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,291
Okay.

261
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:11,041
I'll hold your hand.

262
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,625
If you want to do it,
and Sam doesn't want to,

263
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:15,834
I will.

264
00:11:17,417 --> 00:11:19,917
Thank you.

265
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:23,917
So what do you think?

266
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:26,792
Limited loss of wall function.
Cardiac output is great.

267
00:11:26,834 --> 00:11:28,041
I'm liking what I'm seeing,
Pete.

268
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,208
You sound surprised.

269
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,000
Well, your b.P.'S normal,

270
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:32,375
no dysrhythmias,

271
00:11:32,417 --> 00:11:34,750
your cognitive skills
post bypass--completely intact.

272
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:36,333
You are back, Pete.

273
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:39,041
Back to counting the ten years
I have left. Great.

274
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,333
Oh, no, no.
That's not where you're at.

275
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,333
I mean, there are tons of
bypass patients that live 20,

276
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,000
25 years past surgery.

277
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:47,000
And with these numbers, I don't
see why you can't either.

278
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,041
Save it, Sam. I'm a doctor.
I've read the literature.

279
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,208
Okay, but as a cardiologist,
I'm telling you,

280
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,208
don't go picking out
headstones.

281
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,208
All right, you've got a second
chance to live a long life.

282
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,875
Live it. All right?
You're lucky.

283
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,542
Thanks.

284
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,041
All right.

285
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,417
I got your message.

286
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:05,625
How bad is it?

287
00:12:05,667 --> 00:12:06,875
He's a lot worse off
than last week.

288
00:12:06,917 --> 00:12:08,458
His temperature keeps spiking,

289
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,083
and he's showing signs
of liver failure.

290
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,500
What happened?

291
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:13,000
Um...

292
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:15,000
I did a blood count,
I did a liver biopsy,

293
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,291
and, um...
The lupus has triggered

294
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:22,375
a disease called hemophagocytic
lymphohistiocytosis.

295
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:24,208
What does that mean?

296
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,041
It means that his immune cells
are attacking his own body.

297
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,917
It's very aggressive. He's
gonna need a round of chemo,

298
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,917
he's gonna need
a stem cell transplant,

299
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,875
he's gonna have to stay in
the hospital for several weeks.

300
00:12:32,917 --> 00:12:34,625
A stem cell transplant?
Yeah.

301
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:36,667
It's very serious,
and he could die.

302
00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:39,750
We need to find a stem cell
match as soon as possible.

303
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,291
This--this is, uh...

304
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,750
Well, okay, if it's
an insurance question,

305
00:12:42,792 --> 00:12:44,458
I've already
contacted medicaid.

306
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,625
But more importantly, Jim,

307
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:47,500
you need to find this kid
a foster family.

308
00:12:47,542 --> 00:12:48,750
He can't
go through this alone.

309
00:12:48,792 --> 00:12:50,291
We've gone over this, Cooper.

310
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,083
Look, I-I know.
Okay, he needs somebody.

311
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,458
I'm doing everything I can,
okay?

312
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,959
I'll be here
whenever I can.

313
00:12:58,542 --> 00:13:00,959
I need you to sign
some consent forms.

314
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:14,792
What are you doing?

315
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,458
Uh... I'm just spying
on my woman

316
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,458
and your wife.

317
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,709
What are they doing?

318
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,375
Well, if I had to guess,
I would say that Addison

319
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:24,542
is talking about doing
another round of I.V.F.

320
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:27,000
While Violet is...

321
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:29,041
I'm sorry, man,

322
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,375
but you are screwed.

323
00:13:31,417 --> 00:13:33,041
What? Why?

324
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:36,375
Violet doesn't
do anything halfway generally.

325
00:13:36,417 --> 00:13:38,375
And both of us are looking
for anything to distract us

326
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,667
from the vast morass
of emptiness

327
00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:43,375
our marriage has become,
so...

328
00:13:43,417 --> 00:13:45,208
My man...

329
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,542
Do you know how dark
you sound right now?

330
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:50,291
Look, my point is,
filling Addison's uterus

331
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,542
is gonna become like
an extreme sport with Violet.

332
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,041
Good luck with that.

333
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,041
Well, everything
you said makes total sense.

334
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,625
So you think--

335
00:13:58,667 --> 00:14:01,208
yes. I think you sound focused
and positive and energized,

336
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,500
and that means, for you, you're
making the right decision.

337
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,208
Okay.

338
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:07,583
Do you want me
to go with you?

339
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,333
No, no, i-I'll be okay.
Thank you...

340
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:10,333
Okay.

341
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,750
For offering.

342
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:14,709
Hey.
Hey.

343
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,083
So you're, uh--

344
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,750
on my way to see Jake.
Right.

345
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,750
Okay.

346
00:14:20,792 --> 00:14:22,041
Okay.

347
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,583
L-arginine increases
blood flow to the uterus,

348
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,542
folic acid, which is obvious,

349
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:31,542
paba, which is
a b-complex vitamin--

350
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,792
i-i-i know what that is.

351
00:14:33,834 --> 00:14:35,750
I'm no stranger
to vitamin therapies.

352
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,041
But you don't think,
in conjunction with metformin--

353
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,041
we use metformin for
polycystic ovary syndrome.

354
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:42,041
Yes, but it can also help
with Insulin resistance.

355
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,041
Which there's no evidence
you have.

356
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,750
Okay, but vitamin therapy,

357
00:14:45,792 --> 00:14:46,667
plus metformin,

358
00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:48,792
plus h.G.H. Shots--

359
00:14:48,834 --> 00:14:51,000
equals crazy.

360
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:53,041
Look, Addison, you don't need to
be doing all of this, all right?

361
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,250
At least not yet.

362
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:55,709
You have--you have
two frozen embryos left.

363
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,291
No, I want fresh eggs,
fresh sperm.

364
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,041
I'm taking one last shot
at this, Jake,

365
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,917
and I want
the best possible odds.

366
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,041
You want
the best possible odds?

367
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,083
Yes!

368
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,083
Relax.

369
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,333
I am relaxed!

370
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,208
Oh.

371
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,041
Ah!
Okay. Sorry.

372
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,208
Sorry.

373
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,458
Ow!
Done.

374
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,750
Why does this part
never get easier?

375
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,959
Is there anything
I can do to help or--

376
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,500
we're at the end
of the second week, Sam.

377
00:15:30,542 --> 00:15:31,959
You want to help now?

378
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,250
No, I know that you

379
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,041
and Addison
are doing this together.

380
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:37,041
Well, 'cause you don't
want to, right?

381
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:39,709
No. I mean, you don't
want to see

382
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,333
or hear or talk about

383
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,458
the most important thing
in her life right now--
Violet.

384
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,875
Why are you mad at me?

385
00:15:45,917 --> 00:15:47,875
Because I think when you're
in a committed relationship,

386
00:15:47,917 --> 00:15:50,041
putting your head in the sand
is complete and utter bull--

387
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,542
Violet.

388
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,250
Sam was just trying
to be nice.

389
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,750
Right.

390
00:15:55,792 --> 00:15:57,041
I'm sorry.

391
00:15:57,083 --> 00:16:00,792
I was projecting my own marriage
on to your love life.

392
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:03,041
So, uh, you and Pete...

393
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,917
We suck. We just--
we flat-out suck.

394
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:09,041
And when I think about
how we got here, I wish...

395
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,041
Well, I mean, I wish
a lot of things,

396
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,041
but mostly I wish

397
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:16,583
that we hadn't let it
get to this place,

398
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,166
because, you know, y--

399
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,166
you're angry
and then you're resentful,

400
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:22,166
and then things start to change
between the two of you,

401
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,875
and then before you realize it,
you are so far

402
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:27,041
from the couple
that you used to be,

403
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:30,750
you don't even know how to get
back there, or if you can.

404
00:16:30,792 --> 00:16:32,959
And that's just...

405
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,166
Yeah, you don't want that.

406
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,959
Violet, have you and Pete

407
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,917
ever tried
going to couples therapy?

408
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:39,959
Uh, no, no,
because that would require

409
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,375
actually speaking
to one another.

410
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:44,792
I don't want to leave.

411
00:16:44,834 --> 00:16:46,500
I like it here.

412
00:16:46,542 --> 00:16:48,792
Why can't my parents
be rich doctors

413
00:16:48,834 --> 00:16:50,792
so I can stay here longer?

414
00:16:50,834 --> 00:16:52,542
Or why can't I have
better insurance?

415
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,041
It's safe here.

416
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,917
But it's not real.

417
00:16:55,959 --> 00:16:57,375
I mean, staying sober here

418
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:58,834
is like...

419
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,667
Feeling happy at Disneyland.

420
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:02,583
It's easy.

421
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:05,041
You gotta go out there to see
what you really got here.

422
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,542
You know, for a girl
with all the answers,

423
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,834
you're awfully quiet
about your own crap.

424
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,750
Wow.

425
00:17:10,792 --> 00:17:11,750
Okay.

426
00:17:11,792 --> 00:17:14,583
You want to be mad?
Fine. Be mad.

427
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:15,792
I'm not mad.

428
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,875
I'm just saying, you do
an awful lot of preaching

429
00:17:17,917 --> 00:17:19,041
and not much sharing.

430
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,834
You know, just 'cause
you're a doctor

431
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,792
doesn't mean
you're not one of us.

432
00:17:24,792 --> 00:17:26,542
Okay.

433
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:27,750
Whatever.

434
00:17:27,792 --> 00:17:30,041
I think Hailey has
a point, Amelia.

435
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,166
You haven't been
opening up much.

436
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,667
I open up.

437
00:17:33,709 --> 00:17:35,000
Not to us.

438
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,792
You always have an opinion
about our stuff.

439
00:17:36,834 --> 00:17:38,458
Wow. What is this,
a group pile on?

440
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,458
You didn't kill Ryan.

441
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,834
Excuse me?

442
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:42,875
You didn't kill him.

443
00:17:42,917 --> 00:17:43,875
You might have wrote
the prescriptions,

444
00:17:43,917 --> 00:17:44,875
but he took the drugs
himself.

445
00:17:44,917 --> 00:17:46,041
Shut up, Hailey.

446
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,667
And that guilt?
That's gonna kill you.

447
00:17:47,709 --> 00:17:49,083
That's what killed
my best friend. It was guilt.

448
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:50,250
Because her mom was so freaked,
she had a breakdown

449
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:52,041
and her dad left...
Hailey.

450
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,875
So she was...
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

451
00:17:53,917 --> 00:17:56,000
You're a child,
and you need to shut up.

452
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,000
Amelia--

453
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,041
you didn't kill him.

454
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,041
Okay?
He took the drugs himself.

455
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,792
You didn't make him take them.
He took them himself.

456
00:18:02,834 --> 00:18:04,041
You gotta get that.

457
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,250
Before I leave here,
you have to get that,

458
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,166
'cause if you don't,
you're not gonna make it.

459
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,458
And I need you to make it.

460
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,041
I know you loved him.

461
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,041
And I know he loved you.

462
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:18,834
But he took
the drugs himself.

463
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,875
Okay.

464
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,333

I want a baby and Sam doesn't.
It's that simple.

506
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:14,000
Now we can talk about it,
we can talk around it,

507
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,041
we can say things like,

508
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,041
"we'll deal with it
when the time comes,"

509
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,041
but I don't know how we
get around the simple fact

510
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,041
that I'm in, and Sam's out.

511
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,041
Well, you took the first step
by bringing him here.

512
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,625
Sam, what do you think
about this?

513
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:27,083
Uh, well...

514
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:30,625
Honestly, I don't think
this is useful...

515
00:20:30,667 --> 00:20:32,041
For me, at least.

516
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,625
I don't want a baby,
and I don't know,

517
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:37,250
I've--I've never been
anything but honest about that.

518
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:39,041
So--

519
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,375
so what?

520
00:20:40,417 --> 00:20:42,250
So this isn't my problem.

521
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,583
It's--no, my problem
is that I feel like

522
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,583
you want to have a baby
so badly

523
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:49,208
that you're willing
to risk anything for it--

524
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:52,041
your health, uh, your sanity,

525
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,458
my sanity--
okay, if it had been...

526
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,458
Let--let me--

527
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,792
easier to--
if it had been easier,

528
00:20:55,834 --> 00:20:57,625
if I had gotten pregnant
immediately,

529
00:20:57,667 --> 00:20:58,875
would that have been better?

530
00:20:58,917 --> 00:20:59,875
If...

531
00:20:59,917 --> 00:21:01,125
No, but--
right.

532
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,959
Wait. No.
Listen to me.

533
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,125
I love you.

534
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:07,041
I love you. I support you.
I want you to be happy.

535
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,041
I want us
to have a life together.

536
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,875
The last thing I want to do
is give up because of a problem

537
00:21:11,917 --> 00:21:13,083
that we don't even have yet.

538
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:14,917
Yeah, but we are
going to have it, Sam, soon.

539
00:21:14,959 --> 00:21:16,250
There is going to be
a baby,

540
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,041
and even though I'm the one
doing all the feeding

541
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,041
and the waking up

542
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,250
and everything else there
is to do at the beginning,

543
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,250
it doesn't end there.
It starts there.

544
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:24,208
You know that.
You're a parent.
I--

545
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:27,041
you have to want to do it.

546
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:29,458
I do, more than anything.
You don't.

547
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,041
So I-I don't know
how it could work.

548
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,792
I don't know
how we could work.

549
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:33,917
Well, I want you.

550
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,083
So long as I don't have
a baby.

551
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,875
Well, I want you, Addison.

552
00:21:37,917 --> 00:21:39,041
That's what I want.

553
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:43,000
♪ I try to my best
to keep you here ♪

554
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,792
♪ but it's hard to hold
a shadow ♪

555
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:53,000
I'm glad you were willing
to see me.

556
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:56,375
Why don't you hate me?

557
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:01,500
After the things I said,
you should hate me.

558
00:22:01,542 --> 00:22:03,041
I don't know how to hate you.

559
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:04,792
I-I...

560
00:22:04,834 --> 00:22:07,000
I couldn't if I tried,
so...

561
00:22:09,959 --> 00:22:12,166
Where do I go from here?

562
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:14,291
What do you mean?

563
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,166
I mean, I built this life

564
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:18,166
with all of you,
with the practice,

565
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:20,333
and then I burned it down.

566
00:22:22,834 --> 00:22:25,083
So when I have to leave
this place, I...

567
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:27,125
I don't know
where I go from here.

568
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:32,041
I know I'm supposed
to try to make amends,

569
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:33,417
but I'm not there.
I'm not ready.

570
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:35,041
I don't know how
to face everyone.

571
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:39,125
And, I mean, honestly, Sheldon,
I can barely even look at you.

572
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:42,417
There's a sign
in back of you.

573
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:44,125
That seems
as good an answer

574
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:46,041
as any I could come up with.

575
00:22:52,417 --> 00:22:53,375
Hey, Charlotte.

576
00:22:53,417 --> 00:22:55,250
Do you have patients
this afternoon?

577
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,875
No. Why?

578
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,166
I need you to go
to Mason's school

579
00:22:58,208 --> 00:22:59,792
and save me a seat
at his play

580
00:22:59,834 --> 00:23:01,083
in--in the front row.

581
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:03,041
Sorry, Coop.
Can't do it.

582
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:05,208
Well, you have to. I just
got paged to the hospital.

583
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,041
Coop, I ate pizza with Mason.
I played video games with him.

584
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:10,125
I even helped the kid with
his long division homework,

585
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:13,083
but I draw the line
at sitting in the front row

586
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,667
of "James and the giant peach"

587
00:23:14,709 --> 00:23:16,041
with a child
that's not even mine.

588
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:18,041
I will meet you there.
I promise.

589
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:19,458
Why can't Erica
save you a seat?

590
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,083
Because she's working
backstage with the kids

591
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:22,917
on the costumes.
I'm begging you.

592
00:23:22,959 --> 00:23:25,166
My son. First play ever.

593
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:26,917
Fine.

594
00:23:26,959 --> 00:23:28,166
But you owe me.

595
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:29,709
Big-time.

596
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,041
Yeah.

597
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:36,041
Hey.

598
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:38,041
You look like 10 miles
of bad road.

599
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,000
Charlotte.

600
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:44,583
You do look a little peaked.

601
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:45,792
You okay?

602
00:23:45,834 --> 00:23:48,333
I'm fine.
I just skipped breakfast.

603
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:50,041
Hi. Did you see Amelia?
How's she doing?

604
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:51,959
She's making
some real progress.

605
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,959
- That's good news.
- It is,

606
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,750
especially since some people
don't respond well to therapy.

607
00:23:56,792 --> 00:23:59,083
Well, I hope all of
you do, because eventually,

608
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:01,583
she's gonna need us to join her
for a group therapy session.

609
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:04,333
She needs to make amends
and...

610
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:06,291
Addison!
Addison!

611
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:07,750
Oh, my god.
Addison, what's going on?

612
00:24:07,792 --> 00:24:09,834
All right. Don't move.
Get Jake, Sheldon.

613
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:11,500
Yeah, yeah. I'll...
Get Jake.

614
00:24:11,542 --> 00:24:13,208
No, I don't want
to do this!

615
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,500
What's going on?

616
00:24:14,542 --> 00:24:16,041
I need to sedate him
before we can

617
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:17,750
put in the central line
for the stem cell infusion.

618
00:24:17,792 --> 00:24:19,291
Toby hates needles.

619
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,709
Toby, did Dr. Berman explain
to you what she was doing?

620
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,125
Yes, but I'm scared

621
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:25,875
if she puts me to sleep,
I'll never wake up.

622
00:24:25,917 --> 00:24:27,667
I-I had the same feeling when
I had my appendix taken out.

623
00:24:27,709 --> 00:24:29,166
Okay? I was about your age.

624
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:31,041
Man, I was--
I don't want to die.

625
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:32,250
Hey, who said
you were gonna die?

626
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:33,250
You did.

627
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:35,500
I heard you tell Jim.

628
00:24:35,542 --> 00:24:36,792
No, I did--

629
00:24:36,834 --> 00:24:38,917
Toby,
I'm sorry you heard that,

630
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:41,041
but you didn't understand.
You are not gonna die.

631
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:45,250
Jim was asking me about
some risks and--and...

632
00:24:45,291 --> 00:24:47,041
You are not gonna die.

633
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:51,333
Will you stay with me?

634
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:55,709
Well, I-I could. I know,
uh, Jim wants to stay.

635
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:58,750
He has a million other kids
to take care of.

636
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,041
Um...

637
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,375
Maybe we'll both stay?

638
00:25:06,083 --> 00:25:10,166
Are we ready
to do this now?

639
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:11,959
Yeah. Okay? We're ready?

640
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,792
Yeah, we're ready.

641
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:23,083
Sam, what happened?
I heard Addison collapsed.

642
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:25,166
I don't know. It's some kind of
a side effect with the hormones.

643
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:27,000
You don't think
you should be in there?

644
00:25:27,041 --> 00:25:28,417
No. There's no room
for me in there.

645
00:25:28,458 --> 00:25:30,208
She doesn't want me
in there.

646
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:32,125
Violet's...
In there with her.

647
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:34,750
This is like her--
her project.

648
00:25:34,792 --> 00:25:37,208
Is she planning on raising
the baby with Addison, too?

649
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:39,041
That'd make my life a lot
easier. I'll just take Lucas...

650
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:40,542
That's not funny, man.

651
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:42,458
Dark humor's all I got.

652
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,041
No, it's not.

653
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:46,041
You got a kid
that you love,

654
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:48,875
you got a wife
that you love.

655
00:25:53,917 --> 00:25:55,875
You told me
I had another 25 years,

656
00:25:55,917 --> 00:25:58,041
and the first thing
I thought was,

657
00:25:58,083 --> 00:26:00,917
I might actually be able
to dance at my son's wedding.

658
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:02,834
It made me happy.

659
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:04,834
And then I thought...

660
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:09,291
That means I have
another 25 years with Violet.

661
00:26:12,291 --> 00:26:15,250
I don't know
if I want that.

662
00:26:18,083 --> 00:26:20,250
I'm sorry, man.

663
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:24,458
I won't leave.

664
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:28,500
I don't have it in me
to leave.

665
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:39,333
Hey.

666
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:41,333
Hey. Hey, buddy.

667
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:43,208
How'd it go?

668
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:45,500
He was terrific.
Missed his dad, though.

669
00:26:45,542 --> 00:26:46,500
We all did.

670
00:26:46,542 --> 00:26:49,542
Mason, I am...
Really, really sorry.

671
00:26:49,583 --> 00:26:51,458
You promised
you'd be there...

672
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,458
In the front row.

673
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,959
I know.
Something happened at work--

674
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,709
I forgot
my line to the seagull

675
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,125
'cause I couldn't find
your face.

676
00:26:57,166 --> 00:26:59,709
Oh, honey, you covered so well,
nobody even noticed.

677
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:03,041
Everyone noticed.
They all laughed at me.

678
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:04,083
Oh.

679
00:27:04,125 --> 00:27:05,333
Oh, buddy.

680
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:07,500
Should we go get
some pizza?

681
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:09,375
Just leave me alone,
Cooper.

682
00:27:09,417 --> 00:27:11,583
Oh. It's okay.

683
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:13,792
I'm sorry.

684
00:27:17,709 --> 00:27:21,333
So my abdomen filled
with fluid...

685
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:23,583
Secondary to
the fertility treatment?

686
00:27:23,625 --> 00:27:25,333
It's rare, but it--
it does happen.

687
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:27,041
You can still implant,
though, right?

688
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:28,375
Well, I need to aspirate
the fluid.

689
00:27:28,417 --> 00:27:29,875
You need to rest
for a couple of days,

690
00:27:29,917 --> 00:27:32,291
but then...
If you're ready to go again--

691
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:34,000
I will be.

692
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:41,166
You haven't gone in yet?

693
00:27:41,208 --> 00:27:43,083
Oh, no.
She's still talking to Jake.

694
00:27:43,125 --> 00:27:46,041
He says, uh,
she's gonna be fine

695
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:48,041
and that it was
a complication.

696
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,417
Well,
complications happen.

697
00:27:49,458 --> 00:27:51,000
Yeah. Yeah.

698
00:27:53,792 --> 00:27:55,333
So you can, uh,

699
00:27:55,375 --> 00:27:57,000
you can talk to her now.

700
00:27:57,041 --> 00:27:59,917
I'll let her get her rest.
She knows I'm here.

701
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:01,041
Sam--

702
00:28:01,083 --> 00:28:03,041
she knows I'm here.

703
00:28:08,792 --> 00:28:12,208
Addiction impacts
entire families.

704
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,709
Strong families
are essential components

705
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:16,375
of successful recovery plans.

706
00:28:16,417 --> 00:28:18,041
In this case...

707
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:21,041
Amelia has named all of you

708
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:22,458
as her family.

709
00:28:26,834 --> 00:28:28,583
I don't know...

710
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:31,875
How to apologize.

711
00:28:31,917 --> 00:28:34,417
I don't know how.

712
00:28:36,917 --> 00:28:40,041
I want to take back
everything I said.

713
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:42,625
I know I can't.

714
00:28:42,667 --> 00:28:46,417
I was sick
and I was scared

715
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:48,041
and I didn't mean...

716
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:54,417
I wanted to hurt you.

717
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:57,208
I was trying to hurt you.

718
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:59,500
And I think I succeeded.

719
00:29:01,041 --> 00:29:02,667
And if I could change that,

720
00:29:02,709 --> 00:29:04,667
if I could go back
and unsay--

721
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:07,208
if I could go back
and undo...

722
00:29:09,542 --> 00:29:11,041
The drugs, um,

723
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,458
some people think that
alcohol and drugs,

724
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,500
uh, bring out the truth.

725
00:29:16,542 --> 00:29:18,500
And maybe that's the case
with normal people.

726
00:29:18,542 --> 00:29:20,458
I don't know.

727
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,041
I won't ever know.

728
00:29:22,083 --> 00:29:24,000
But I know that with me...

729
00:29:25,583 --> 00:29:28,041
The drugs bring out lies.

730
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:29,750
They bring out hate

731
00:29:29,792 --> 00:29:33,208
and they bring our cruelty
and viciousness,

732
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:37,041
and those things
are not me.

733
00:29:37,083 --> 00:29:38,542
They're not the real me.

734
00:29:38,583 --> 00:29:43,458
The real me is the person that
you knew before the drugs.

735
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:47,500
The real me is the person
that is sitting here now.

736
00:29:47,542 --> 00:29:50,041
And I hope...

737
00:29:50,083 --> 00:29:52,333
That you believe me...

738
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:55,125
When I say how sorry I am.

739
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:00,333
But even if
you don't believe me,

740
00:30:00,375 --> 00:30:03,875
I have to say it anyway,
because...

741
00:30:03,917 --> 00:30:07,083
I want to live.

742
00:30:07,125 --> 00:30:10,709
The man I love died,
and I think that he would be...

743
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:14,125
I think that he would be
so pissed at me if I died, too,

744
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:16,250
so I'm saying I'm sorry

745
00:30:16,291 --> 00:30:21,000
and... I'm saying that
I hope you can forgive me.

746
00:30:21,041 --> 00:30:24,000
I hope I can forgive myself.

747
00:30:27,083 --> 00:30:29,583
I can't take it back,

748
00:30:29,625 --> 00:30:31,917
but I'm gonna try
to move forward

749
00:30:31,959 --> 00:30:35,709
and I'm going to try
to do better.

750
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:43,000
I'm gonna try to never hurt
any of you ever again.

751
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,583
Hey.

752
00:30:52,625 --> 00:30:54,041
Your mom said you were
doing your homework.

753
00:30:54,083 --> 00:30:55,542
You need any help?

754
00:30:55,583 --> 00:30:57,125
I can do it myself.

755
00:30:57,166 --> 00:30:58,583
All right.

756
00:30:58,625 --> 00:31:01,625
Uh, maybe when you're done,
we can go to the batting cages,

757
00:31:01,667 --> 00:31:03,208
take some swings?

758
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,000
This might take a while.

759
00:31:07,208 --> 00:31:09,417
Mason.

760
00:31:12,709 --> 00:31:15,250
I know you're mad at me
because I missed the play.

761
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,125
And I would love to tell you
that I'm never gonna miss

762
00:31:19,166 --> 00:31:22,166
another school play
or a soccer game, but...

763
00:31:22,208 --> 00:31:25,041
I'm a doctor for kids,
you know, like you.

764
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:27,041
And sometimes,
those kids need me

765
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:29,458
when they're really sick.

766
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,083
More than me?

767
00:31:33,083 --> 00:31:34,458
Sometimes.

768
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,041
But...

769
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:38,208
Look...

770
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,500
I know you must have
been scared

771
00:31:40,542 --> 00:31:42,000
up there on that stage,

772
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:44,041
but I knew you were safe.

773
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:45,500
I knew you were okay.

774
00:31:45,542 --> 00:31:47,625
But I wasn't so sure
about Toby.

775
00:31:47,667 --> 00:31:50,709
He needed a-a procedure
to save his life,

776
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:53,500
and unlike you, who's got your
mom and me and your friends,

777
00:31:53,542 --> 00:31:56,625
he doesn't have anybody.

778
00:31:56,667 --> 00:32:00,000
Do you understand?

779
00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:03,500
All right.

780
00:32:03,542 --> 00:32:05,291
I'll let you do your work.

781
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:07,542
I love you.

782
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,458
Pete and I,

783
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,917
it's just, we...

784
00:32:12,959 --> 00:32:15,291
We just coexist.

785
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,208
And intellectually,
I get it.

786
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,417
There are stages
to Pete's recovery

787
00:32:19,458 --> 00:32:21,291
that--that mirror
the stages of grief,

788
00:32:21,333 --> 00:32:24,208
and that can be very hard
for a couple to get through.

789
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:28,417
I have walked many patients
through this exact same thing,

790
00:32:28,458 --> 00:32:31,208
and I've seen it shred couples,
shred families.

791
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,458
But?

792
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,458
But I've also seen it
go the other way.

793
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,083
I-I've seen grief
bring families together.

794
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:40,959
That's the stage that i'm
waiting for...

795
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,041
The stage where we say,
"oh, my god that was hard,

796
00:32:44,083 --> 00:32:48,333
but--but we're better off
for it," you know?

797
00:32:48,375 --> 00:32:51,959
Or we love each other
so much more because we stuck.

798
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,709
That's what I'm waiting for.

799
00:32:55,083 --> 00:32:57,041
But I don't see any sign that

800
00:32:57,083 --> 00:32:59,750
that's what he's hoping for
or working toward.

801
00:32:59,792 --> 00:33:02,750
It's just...

802
00:33:02,792 --> 00:33:04,250
Oh, my god.

803
00:33:04,291 --> 00:33:06,709
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

804
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,000
What?

805
00:33:08,041 --> 00:33:10,125
I don't want you to do it.

806
00:33:10,166 --> 00:33:11,583
The embryo transfer--

807
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:13,667
I don't--i don't want you
to try again.

808
00:33:13,709 --> 00:33:14,667
I'm gonna go.

809
00:33:14,709 --> 00:33:15,625
Wait. Are you okay?

810
00:33:15,667 --> 00:33:17,959
Yes, yes. I just need
to talk to Pete.

811
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:21,834
Hear me out.

812
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:24,083
Um...

813
00:33:24,125 --> 00:33:26,083
Look, what happened to you,

814
00:33:26,125 --> 00:33:28,792
uh, it really--
it really scared me.

815
00:33:28,834 --> 00:33:30,333
And I know that--that--
that there was a complication

816
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,750
or--or whatever,

817
00:33:31,792 --> 00:33:34,083
but it really--it--
I was really scared.

818
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:37,041
So for you to try
to do it again,

819
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:39,542
I...

820
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:41,166
I love you.

821
00:33:41,208 --> 00:33:42,625
All right?
And I'm asking you, please--

822
00:33:42,667 --> 00:33:45,041
I already did it.

823
00:33:45,083 --> 00:33:47,792
This morning, Jake transferred
two of my frozen embryos.

824
00:33:47,834 --> 00:33:50,333
I was gonna tell you
tonight.

825
00:33:50,375 --> 00:33:52,667
But just so you know,

826
00:33:52,709 --> 00:33:54,041
Sam, this is it.

827
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:56,041
Okay? No more hormones,
no more I.V.F.,

828
00:33:56,083 --> 00:33:58,041
no more sperm donors.

829
00:33:58,083 --> 00:34:01,583
I'm either pregnant
or I'm not.

830
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,041
Okay.

831
00:34:13,667 --> 00:34:16,041
I don't want to be Anna.

832
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:17,041
What?

833
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:18,792
Your wife. Your first wife.

834
00:34:18,834 --> 00:34:20,667
You hated her, but you stuck.

835
00:34:20,709 --> 00:34:22,709
I don't want you to hate me
but stick anyway.

836
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:24,041
I don't--i don't--
I don't want to be Anna.

837
00:34:24,083 --> 00:34:25,709
And I know we took vows,

838
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,792
and I know you pride yourself
on sticking to your word.

839
00:34:27,834 --> 00:34:30,041
I know you'll stay, Pete.
You'll stay no matter what.

840
00:34:30,083 --> 00:34:32,500
But... I don't want that.

841
00:34:32,542 --> 00:34:35,792
That is no life for me
or for Lucas.

842
00:34:35,834 --> 00:34:37,792
And--and I know you are
more comfortable sticking

843
00:34:37,834 --> 00:34:39,792
than being the guy
who leaves,

844
00:34:39,834 --> 00:34:41,917
so, um...

845
00:34:41,959 --> 00:34:45,375
So I'll--I'll leave you.

846
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:47,000
If you can't do it

847
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:49,709
but that's really
what you want,

848
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,750
if you don't love me...

849
00:34:54,875 --> 00:34:57,709
If you don't love me anymore,

850
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,667
then ask me to leave...

851
00:34:59,709 --> 00:35:02,291
And I will.

852
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:04,625
I'll do that for you,

853
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:06,875
for us.

854
00:35:06,917 --> 00:35:08,125
And we'll...

855
00:35:10,583 --> 00:35:13,166
We'll figure out
how to make it okay for Lucas.

856
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:17,333
I do love you.
I still love you.

857
00:35:17,375 --> 00:35:19,667
But I don't want this
for us.

858
00:35:19,709 --> 00:35:21,041
So think about it.

859
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:22,917
Take a week.
Take--take your time.

860
00:35:22,959 --> 00:35:26,917
But... know that I mean it.

861
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:28,500
I'll let you out.

862
00:35:28,542 --> 00:35:30,792
I'll be the one
who leaves.

863
00:35:30,834 --> 00:35:32,166
Okay?

864
00:35:36,625 --> 00:35:39,208
Can you nod if it's okay?

865
00:35:51,917 --> 00:35:54,000
Okay.

866
00:36:33,208 --> 00:36:35,500
Sorry to bother you.

867
00:36:35,542 --> 00:36:36,875
It's no bother.

868
00:36:36,917 --> 00:36:38,667
Mason was hoping
to find Cooper.

869
00:36:38,709 --> 00:36:40,959
Ah, Cooper's at the hospital
right now.

870
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,250
He's there a lot.

871
00:36:42,291 --> 00:36:43,458
Well, he helps
a lot of kids there.

872
00:36:45,208 --> 00:36:47,166
Come on.
I was just heading over.

873
00:36:47,208 --> 00:36:49,458
I bet we could find him
together.

874
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:52,166
Say thank you.

875
00:36:52,208 --> 00:36:53,542
Thank you, Charlotte.

876
00:36:53,583 --> 00:36:55,083
You bet.

877
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:13,125
Did you think about it?

878
00:37:19,917 --> 00:37:23,041
I'm so sorry, Violet.

879
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:30,333
Okay.

880
00:37:43,542 --> 00:37:46,083
Hey. Hey, Toby.
How you feelin'?

881
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:48,667
I'm tired,
but less than yesterday.

882
00:37:48,709 --> 00:37:51,500
Getting stronger every day,
though, right, buddy?

883
00:37:51,542 --> 00:37:53,041
Okay. So this is great.

884
00:37:53,083 --> 00:37:56,041
Your t-cell count
is returning to normal.

885
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:59,041
Hey.

886
00:37:59,083 --> 00:38:02,041
Mason, come in.

887
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:05,041
I want to introduce you
to my son.

888
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:06,625
Mason, this is Toby.
