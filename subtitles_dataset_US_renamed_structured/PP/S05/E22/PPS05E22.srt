I'm done delivering.

54
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:20,542
I-I don't want to be
on this floor.

55
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:21,917
Okay.

56
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:23,500
And wrap his head
right away.

57
00:02:23,542 --> 00:02:25,041
I don't want to see it.

58
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:27,041

59
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:29,583

Before I can see him.

60
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:31,041
I-I don't want
to hear him cry.

61
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,875
Just--before he cries.

62
00:02:32,917 --> 00:02:34,542
Amelia...

63
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:37,291
Right.

64
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:39,625
A baby without a frontal lobe
can't cry.

65
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:43,917
I saw one once

66
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:45,917
when I was an intern.

67
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:49,166
They make this kind of
squeaking noise.

68
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,041
Brainless babies squeak.

69
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,709
I mean, it's the only way
you can describe

70
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,333
the noise they make,
but...

71
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,959
I mean, you'd think that
it would be awful,

72
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,542
but actually,
it's kinda...

73
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:03,500
Life will out, you know?

74
00:03:03,542 --> 00:03:07,000
I know.

75
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:10,041
Anyway...

76
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,583
Take him away
before he squeaks.

77
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,041
So Pete's just gonna admit

78
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:24,667
that he took his patient
off the ventilator?

79
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:26,041
Yep, he's convinced
he did the right thing.

80
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,667
It's gonna make it hard
for his lawyer.

81
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:29,417
What's going on? Is something
wrong with Pete?

82
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,041
No.
Amelia's in labor.

83
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,250
Oh, god.

84
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:33,959
Okay, i-I'm gonna go see--

85
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,041
Jake says we should
all stay here.

86
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:39,000
Well, he might need a consult.
Amelia made it clear that she
doesn't want you in there, so--

87
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,166
really, Sam?
Hey, hey.

88
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,041
Is she in labor?
Yeah.

89
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,208
Where's Coop?

90
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,834
He's with Violet.

91
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,208
Woman nearly broke down our door
at the crack of dawn,

92
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,000
wanting to scream
about Pete.
How is she?

93
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,834
How do you think
she is?

94
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:52,417
Terrified,
blaming everyone but Pete.

95
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,417
Jake...

96
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,834
Just give me a minute.

97
00:03:56,875 --> 00:04:00,041
Okay, first I want to say,
that as Amelia's doctor,

98
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,458
no one goes near her

99
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,083
unless you're sure
you can be supportive.

100
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,917
Why wouldn't
we be supportive?

101
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,500
Jake, what are you
talking about?

102
00:04:06,542 --> 00:04:09,709
Amelia wants to donate
her baby's organs.

103
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:13,917
How long have you
known about this?

104
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:16,041
Since she chose me
as her o.B.
That's murder.

105
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,333
Sam, please, do not get
religious on me here.

106
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:18,750
This has nothing to do
with religion.

107
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:20,917
The American academy
of pediatrics states...

108
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,083
I know what it states.

109
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,917
That a declaration of
brain death has to be made

110
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:25,500
before procuring the organs.

111
00:04:25,542 --> 00:04:28,041
And since there's no brain
in a child that's anencephalic--

112
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,667
and still medical ethicists
are split

113
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:32,083
on whether it's acceptable
to retrieve organs from them.

114
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,917
Why not just wait
till the baby dies?

115
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,750
Because by then,
it'll be too late.

116
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:37,125
The organs will deteriorate,

117
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,041
and they will no longer
be viable for transplant.

118
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,917
I need to go consult
our lawyer.

119
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:42,917
Charlotte,
Charlotte...

120
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:45,041
We're talking about
Amelia here.

121
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,458
I know it's Amelia,

122
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,291
which is why I'm not revoking
your privileges

123
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,959
and throwing you out of here.

124
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,917
This is a person I love.

125
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,709
I need to consult the lawyers
that represent this hospital

126
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,291
to see what they think,

127
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,000
because I think
this is killing a baby.

128
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,041
Calling the case
of Peter Wilder.

129
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,250
Counselors.

130
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,166
The state contends
that Dr. Wilder showed

131
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,083
reckless disregard both for
the life of his patient

132
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,500
and for the laws of this state
when he intentionally--

133
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:18,041
he pulled a Kevorkian?

134
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,709
My client followed
the instructions--
a Kevorkian? Are you serious?

135
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,709
Pete.
Dr. Wilder.

136
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,625
My patient did not want to be
kept alive by life support.
Stop talking.

137
00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:26,083
Your client killed a guy.
He doesn't look too sorry.

138
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,792
Your honor, if you--
I'm not sorry.

139
00:05:27,834 --> 00:05:29,709
Oh, Pete.
I am not sorry.

140
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,166
Good. You made this easy.
Bail is denied.

141
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:56,417
You have something to say

142
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,959
or are you
just gonna watch me?

143
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,125
'Cause this gown is backless,

144
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,125
so when I turn around
to go that way,

145
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:05,333
you're gonna get a really great
view of my maternity panties.

146
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,792
That was quite a bombshell
Jake dropped on us today

147
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:10,333
about you donating
the baby's organs.

148
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,125
I'm like that...

149
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:15,417
All bombshell-y.

150
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:19,041
I was wondering how you
came to your decision.

151
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,041
To my decision?

152
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,875
My decision to donate
the organs

153
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,625
of my brainless baby?

154
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,000
Amelia.

155
00:06:30,542 --> 00:06:33,041
I'm... having...

156
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,041
A contraction.

157
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:36,375
Is there...

158
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:38,417
Can I do anything?

159
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:39,583
It hurts.

160
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:43,709
Don't touch me.

161
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:56,917
Are you all right?

162
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,834
I'm fine.

163
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,291
Contractions come and go.

164
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,917
That's what happens
when you're having a baby,

165
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:05,041
even a unicorn baby.

166
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:06,417
A unicorn baby?

167
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,041
Well, that's an interesting
choice of words.

168
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,083
Sheldon, I'm doing
a thing here.

169
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,959
What do you want?

170
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,709
Sometimes people think they can
circumvent the grieving process

171
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,291
by focusing on
an external goal.

172
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,959
And... while concentrating

173
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,208
on the benefits
of organ donation

174
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,041
is a perfectly valid
short-term coping mechanism,

175
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,542
it can't replace the work
you need to do

176
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,542
to deal with your own
profound loss.

177
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,417
The work I need to do?

178
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:32,542
The...

179
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:36,166
Are you freakin' kidding me?

180
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:37,959
Look at me.

181
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,959
This is supposed to be
the happiest day of my life.

182
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,959
I'm having a baby.
I'm in labor.

183
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,917
Yay. I am dealing
with my loss, Sheldon.

184
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:49,041
I am swimming in it.

185
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,041
I just wanted to make sure
you thought this through.

186
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,875
I... I just want
to help you--

187
00:07:53,917 --> 00:07:56,000
no, you just don't want
to feel guilty.

188
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:59,000
Get out. Please.

189
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,959
How do you even declare
brain death

190
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,458
in an anencephalic child?

191
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,125
Lack of reflexes,
pupillary responses.

192
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,959
No. Those criteria
don't apply here.

193
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,291
They indicate an absence
of brain stem activity.

194
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,750
Amelia's baby has
a rudimentary brain stem.

195
00:08:17,792 --> 00:08:19,083
It'll never
gain consciousness.

196
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,333
Exactly.

197
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,750
There is zero chance
it will ever have

198
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,083
any kind of meaningful life.

199
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,041
Will you stop saying "it"?

200
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,709
Because the baby
will be alive.

201
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,583
It's not a life I'd want,
but it's not a life I'd kill.

202
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:33,083
Stop saying "it."
Say "he."

203
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,917
Say "him."

204
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:38,542
You have to kill him
to recover the organs.

205
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,125
Look, Sam, I need your help

206
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,166
to harvest the heart
and the lungs.

207
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:45,208
Amelia needs your help.

208
00:08:52,792 --> 00:08:56,041
I want to help,
and I-I don't know how.

209
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,542
Should I call Derek?

210
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,542
No, she expressly asked me
not to call her family.

211
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,208
She wants to do this
on her own.

212
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,834
Well, I have to do something.
I can't just--

213
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,834
I-I have to do something.
You want to help?

214
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,000
Sam is the best cardio guy
at St. ambrose.

215
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:10,000
Get him to harvest
the heart and lungs.

216
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,041
Do you need anything?

217
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,583
No.

218
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,792
I made my cell mate my bitch,
so I'm good.

219
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:27,000
Little prison humor.
Sorry.

220
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,041
Roberta's gonna appeal
the judge's decision.

221
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,500
She says you should get bail.

222
00:09:31,542 --> 00:09:33,667
She said that the judge
was prejudiced.

223
00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:35,208
That judge was an ass.

224
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,041
Hey, Pete, I'm freaking out
here, okay?

225
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,417
I'm freaking out. I--
okay, okay.

226
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:41,333
Hey.

227
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,041
I love you.

228
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:50,709
How's Lucas?

229
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,542
He's good.
He misses you.

230
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,917
I told him that you were
out of town for a while.

231
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,917
We shouldn't lie.

232
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,083
We shouldn't lie?

233
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,125
What should I tell him,
Pete?

234
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,709
Really, what?

235
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,417
Daddy's in jail because that's
where they put...

236
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:06,625
Accused murderers?

237
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:08,041
I did the right thing.

238
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,250
You did the right
thing by your patient.

239
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:11,750
You did not do the right thing
by our family.

240
00:10:11,792 --> 00:10:14,458
You did not do the right thing
by our son.

241
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,834
You need to cooperate.

242
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,959
I will not say
that I'm sorry.

243
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,375
Pete, I get
that you're not sorry.

244
00:10:23,417 --> 00:10:26,041
I don't need you to be sorry.
I need you to not be in prison.

245
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,041
So please say whatever
you have to say.

246
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,583
Cooperate.

247
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,375
Bail was denied entirely?

248
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:36,291
Yeah, entirely.
But they're appealing that,
right? They can appeal that.

249
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,709
They are.
Because it seems
a little extreme.

250
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,000
Well, he did kill someone.

251
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,875
S-Someone who wasn't
going to recover,

252
00:10:41,917 --> 00:10:43,542
someone who's partner
had asked him to--

253
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,959
Pete knew the law.
He broke the law.

254
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,166
And he put himself

255
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,500
and the hospital at risk
when he did it.

256
00:10:47,542 --> 00:10:49,667
This is not helpful.
Can we not--

257
00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:52,875
can we just not...
Debate it for once?

258
00:10:52,917 --> 00:10:54,041
This is a mistake.

259
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,041
Amelia's in a very bad place.

260
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:57,542
Did you just see her?

261
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,208
I couldn't stay away
even though it's just possible

262
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,125
that she hates me
enough to kill me.
Yeah, if I don't do it first.

263
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:04,083
I told you not to go see her
if you couldn't be supportive.

264
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,709
- I was supporting her.
- The argument is pointless.

265
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,834
The hospital still hasn't signed
off on the organ procurement.

266
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,125
And they shouldn't.

267
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,542
Do you know
how many babies die ever year

268
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,333
- waiting for organ transplants?
- Charlotte,

269
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,041
you have to fight here.

270
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,959
Who thinks this is
a good idea?

271
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,041
Who's against?

272
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,041
We know how Sam feels.

273
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,542
We're split
right down the middle.

274
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:26,333
Aren't we a microcosm
of the medical community?

275
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:29,208
I hate my job.

276
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,667
Sam, this organ procurement
has to be flawless.

277
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:43,583
Every surgery
has to be flawless.

278
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,125
I know. It's just...

279
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,041
It's her baby's heart.

280
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:51,375
It's a baby's heart,
and when we get one...

281
00:11:51,417 --> 00:11:53,041
Look, if it were me,

282
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,959
there's no one I'd rather have
holding the scalpel than you.

283
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,041
Well, it's a good thing
it isn't you, then, isn't it?
Oh, Sam.

284
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:01,542
Look, Amelia's situation
is tragic.

285
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:04,375
But just because her baby's
going to die

286
00:12:04,417 --> 00:12:06,166
doesn't mean that it's okay
for me to...

287
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,792
Rush the process.

288
00:12:07,834 --> 00:12:10,917
Sam, I know I'm asking you
to do the hard thing here,

289
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,041
but when people we love
need us,

290
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,834
sometimes
we have to compromise.

291
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,375
Today's lecture's
on compromise?

292
00:12:16,417 --> 00:12:18,583
Because I remember
the last one,

293
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,667
you said, uh,
if I wasn't all in,

294
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:22,250
then I had to just walk away.

295
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:24,166
So which one is it, Addison?

296
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,041
I know you saw
me and Jake,

297
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,500
and I probably owe you
an explanation--

298
00:12:27,542 --> 00:12:29,500
no, no, you don't
have to explain

299
00:12:29,542 --> 00:12:31,709
why you gave an ultimatum,

300
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,041
and when I couldn't answer
for five seconds,

301
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:38,041
you immediately moved on
to someone else.

302
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:41,208
That definitely, definitely
doesn't demand an explanation.

303
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,208
Your inability to answer,
Sam,

304
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,750
that was my answer.

305
00:12:44,792 --> 00:12:46,041
Look,
I don't want to talk--

306
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,542
I will recommend

you're a mother.

442
00:19:15,542 --> 00:19:18,041
We can't go in there
because we're mothers.

443
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,750

We're softer.

446
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,041

that you and I

447
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,417
both became mothers

448
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:36,041
without ever giving birth.

449
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:38,041

450
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,000
Not get to be a mother.

451
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,208

to cooperate?

452
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,041
No.
To tell me
to keep my mouth shut...

453
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,166
No.
Or better yet,
to tell me to apologize?

454
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:51,041

00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,417

any special lunches at school,

he brings home,

a 10-day-old boy

534
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:16,291
who was born blind, but could
see if he had new corneas.

535
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:18,458
I read this blog about

536
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,875
this 14-month-old kid
named Gideon in San Diego

537
00:23:21,917 --> 00:23:23,875
who's been on
a heart-lung machine for months

538
00:23:23,917 --> 00:23:26,250
because he needs
one tiny valve in his heart.

539
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:29,041
There's burned babies
who need skin.

540
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:30,834
There's infants
who need livers,

541
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:32,709
and toddlers
who need kidneys,

542
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,291
and there's even this one
4-month-old girl named Lulu

543
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:37,959
who needs
a multiple-organ transplant.

544
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:42,417
My baby...

545
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:44,667
Could save
all of those babies.

546
00:23:44,709 --> 00:23:47,417
He could be responsible
for kids leaving the hospital

547
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:49,875
and going home
and growing up

548
00:23:49,917 --> 00:23:52,250
and falling in love
and having sex

549
00:23:52,291 --> 00:23:53,875
and arguing
with their boyfriends

550
00:23:53,917 --> 00:23:56,125
and making mistakes
and living

551
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:59,125
and maybe not ruining
their lives with drugs.

552
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:01,875
What I'm asking you to do

553
00:24:01,917 --> 00:24:04,542
is unimaginable.

554
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:07,417
But it's also everything

555
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:10,083
those other mothers
could ever imagine.

556
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:15,333
I'm his mom.

557
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:18,250
And I'm asking you
to do this.

558
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,041
If I can get there,
why can't you?

559
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:36,041
I mean,
does it occur to you

560
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:37,875
that somebody else
might want some of those?

561
00:24:37,917 --> 00:24:41,166
No. I mean, the hand to
the mouth to the box, it's...

562
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:42,709
Any news--
babies, bail?

563
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,583
You think we'd be standing here
if there was any news?

564
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:47,125
Amelia's still in labor,
Pete's still in jail.

565
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:48,583
Oh, cookies
for breakfast?

566
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:50,041
It was his idea.

567
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:51,458
Hey.

568
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,166
Hey.

569
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:56,709
Is that yours, Addison?
No.

570
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,500
No, that's me.
Violet?

571
00:24:58,542 --> 00:25:01,583
Charlotte. Amelia's
6 centimeters dilated.

572
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,000
Baby's on the way.

Are you coming?

574
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:11,208
The hospital lawyers haven't
signed off on this yet.

575
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,834
I can still do
the delivery.

576
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:14,834
I'm just saying,
you can't harvest any organs

577
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:16,208
until we get
explicit permission.

578
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,625
Fine.

579
00:25:17,667 --> 00:25:19,041
So you're not
gonna do anything--

580
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:20,417
Charlotte, I heard you.

581
00:25:20,458 --> 00:25:22,542
Jake, I want to go in
with you.

582
00:25:22,583 --> 00:25:23,959
No.
Jake--

583
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,875

the answer is no.

584
00:25:25,917 --> 00:25:29,000
Sorry, Addison.

Aah!

589
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,041
Ah!

590
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:48,125
Oh, well, we should
call Violet,

591
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:50,000
let her know
what's going on.

592
00:25:50,041 --> 00:25:53,417
Yeah.

593
00:25:56,583 --> 00:25:58,041
You know,
women who use cocaine

594
00:25:58,083 --> 00:26:00,041
are at greater risk
than the rest of the population

595
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:02,041
for all sorts
of complications.

596
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:03,291

there's placental abruption,

597

and--and--and...

598
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,250
Why do you know that?

599
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:10,667
I did a lot of research

600
00:26:10,709 --> 00:26:12,375
after Amelia told me
she was pregnant.
Oh.

601
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:14,917
It was my way
of being supportive.

602
00:26:14,959 --> 00:26:17,458
Not that she wants
my support anymore.

603
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,041
Mm.

604
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:21,625
It was oxy.

605
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:23,041
What?

606
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:24,625
Amelia's drug of choice...

607
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:26,417
She was doing oxy,
not cocaine.

608
00:26:26,458 --> 00:26:27,709
So?

609
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:31,208
So maybe everything
will turn out all right.

610
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:36,041
Well, sure, because oxy's
like a prenatal vitamin.

00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:17,709
I sent her home.

900
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,083
Why?

901
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,917
Because after the kind of
day that I had--

902
00:40:20,959 --> 00:40:22,083
that we've had...

903
00:40:22,125 --> 00:40:23,834
Hi, baby.

904
00:40:23,875 --> 00:40:25,208
You want to see your kid.

905
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,875
Well, he's not your kid,
remember?

906
00:40:26,917 --> 00:40:29,041
Ooh, boy.
You are gonna make this

907
00:40:29,083 --> 00:40:31,041
as difficult as possible,
aren't you?

908
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:32,875
You know what?
We're both exhausted, Sam.

909
00:40:32,917 --> 00:40:34,041
It's been a really long day,

910
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:35,667
and I don't have the energy
to fight.

911
00:40:35,709 --> 00:40:36,875
Well, I do.
Sam--

912
00:40:36,917 --> 00:40:39,041
all right, I have the energy
to fight for you.

913
00:40:39,083 --> 00:40:41,125
I'm--I'm fighting for you
right now.

914
00:40:41,166 --> 00:40:42,458
What?

915
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,041
When you asked me if--
if I was all in,

916
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:45,458
I-I should've said yes,

917
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,291
so i'm--I'm saying yes now.

918
00:40:47,333 --> 00:40:49,041
Well, it's too late.
I love you.

919
00:40:49,083 --> 00:40:50,542
You know, I just told you,
it's too late.

920
00:40:50,583 --> 00:40:52,625
I'm in love with you.
It's not too late.
No--

921
00:40:52,667 --> 00:40:54,041
it's never too late.

922
00:40:54,083 --> 00:40:55,333
When you had the chance,
you didn't want me,

923
00:40:55,375 --> 00:40:56,542
you didn't want to have
a family,

924
00:40:56,583 --> 00:40:57,750
but then you see me
with Jake, and then--

925
00:40:57,792 --> 00:40:58,959
I don't care about Jake.

926
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,041
You've been with him,
what, two minutes?

927
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:01,208
Look, you were right.

928
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,959
I... I didn't want a baby.

929
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,291
And I don't.
I don't want a baby.

930
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:08,875
I want this baby.

931
00:41:08,917 --> 00:41:10,041
I want Henry.

932
00:41:10,083 --> 00:41:11,750
And... I want you

933
00:41:11,792 --> 00:41:14,166
and me and Henry
to be a family.

934
00:41:14,208 --> 00:41:16,709
I was afraid of that before.
I just--

935
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:18,750
I couldn't imagine
being a new father

936
00:41:18,792 --> 00:41:21,166
and having a whole new family.

937
00:41:21,208 --> 00:41:23,750
It was unimaginable,
but...

939
00:41:25,291 --> 00:41:27,875
But I can imagine it now.

940
00:41:27,917 --> 00:41:30,333
I can see it.

941
00:41:30,375 --> 00:41:31,917
So...

942
00:41:31,959 --> 00:41:33,291
I'm all in.

943
00:41:33,333 --> 00:41:35,250
I'm all in
and I'm fighting for you.

944
00:41:35,291 --> 00:41:38,041
Look...
I know that this is, uh--

945
00:41:38,083 --> 00:41:39,208
Sam, what are you doing?

946
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:40,917
Wait. Wait a minute.

947
00:41:40,959 --> 00:41:43,041
This is not,
as, uh, traditional,

948
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:44,291
but for now...

949
00:41:48,083 --> 00:41:50,834
Uh, Addison Forbes Montgomery,

950
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:53,041
I love you.

951
00:41:53,083 --> 00:41:55,208
Will you marry me?
