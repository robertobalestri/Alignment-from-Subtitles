1
00:00:03,291 --> 00:00:05,083
♪ Ohhh ohhh ohhh ♪

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,041
I was thinking
how I keep waiting

3
00:00:08,083 --> 00:00:10,917
for life to get easier.

4
00:00:10,959 --> 00:00:13,166
You know? Lower stakes.

5
00:00:13,208 --> 00:00:15,041
Less risk, more reward.
Easier.

6
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:20,667
And I was thinking
that maybe it doesn't.

7
00:00:20,709 --> 00:00:23,041
I was thinking that maybe
the struggle, the climb,

8
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:26,333
the one obstacle after another,
maybe

9
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:29,000
that's just life.

10
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:43,041
Done.
Done.

11
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:44,208
Eighty-eight seconds.

12
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,041
Hmm.

13
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:47,250
Can I call Cooper now?

14
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:49,375
You can call Cooper now.

15
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:56,041
Nights when Lucas
stays with Pete used to mean

16
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:58,041
a long, hot,
uninterrupted bath.

17
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:00,166
But this is so much better.
Yeah?

18
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:04,500
Well, I'm gonna take
a half day tomorrow.

19
00:01:04,542 --> 00:01:07,917
Yay! I'm gonna come home
for lunch, I'll see you then.

20
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:10,250
I was thinking maybe you'd
bring Lucas to the fire station.

21
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:12,959
That'd be the coolest place
he's ever been.

22
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:17,041
That's really sweet.

23
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:18,375
Oh...

24
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:22,041
That was really dismissive.

25
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:23,458
That's not how I meant it--

26
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,792
no? How--? No?
How did you mean it?

27
00:01:25,834 --> 00:01:31,834
Ow. Look, you make me happy,
Violet.

28
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:33,208
And I'm ready
for this to be more.

29
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:38,041
I want you to meet my friends.
I wanna get to know your son.

30
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:41,041
I want your toothbrush
in my bathroom.

31
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:43,041
I'm ready
for it to be real.

32
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:45,750
Is that what you want?

33
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:51,959
Is it Pete?
I-- Scott, i-- i--

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,709
I like you. I like this.
Yeah?

35
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,875
But my life is--
it's complicated.

36
00:01:58,917 --> 00:02:00,917
Everyone's life
is complicated.

37
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:05,667
The question is, do you want me
to be a part of yours?

38
00:02:08,417 --> 00:02:09,500
How you feeling now?

39
00:02:09,542 --> 00:02:10,542
Good.

40
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:13,667
Really good.
And I'm so grateful.

41
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:15,792
I was a zombie
and you woke me up.

42
00:02:15,834 --> 00:02:18,041
Well, the wrong medication
can make everything worse.

43
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:19,667
But now
that the fog has lifted,

44
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:22,250
we can work toward
a proper diagnosis.

45
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:24,709
Well, today, right now,
I feel normal.

46
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,750
I got up at 6,
I did a load of Sam's laundry,

47
00:02:27,792 --> 00:02:29,792
I alphabetized
his bookshelves.

48
00:02:29,834 --> 00:02:31,959
Heh. I don't know about you,

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,250
but I hate when people's books

50
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,583
are just randomly stuffed
in there.

51
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:37,083
You're looking for one,
you can't find it.

52
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:38,500
Okay.

53
00:02:38,542 --> 00:02:42,041
Then I went for a run,
and I looked at the ocean.

54
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:44,583
And I didn't just stare at it.
I really...

55
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:45,917
I really saw it.

56
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:47,500
Well, that's a lot
for a morning.

57
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:50,041
Yeah, well, I have 20 years
to make up for.

58
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:52,709
For myself
and for my brother.

59
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,041
I want us to be closer
but...

60
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,792
I don't know how to--

61
00:02:56,834 --> 00:03:00,041
you can always talk to me,
Corinne. Always.

62
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:02,291
I'm just not sure
where to start.

63
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,417
I mean, what to leave out.

64
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:06,041
There's a lot
that I am not proud of.

65
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,125
Well, that was your past

66
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,125
and perhaps as we get
more comfortable,

67
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:10,417
we can address that.

68
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,041
Why don't we focus on
what's happening now?

69
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,959
I'm ready to start over.

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,041
To have the kind of life
that everyone else has.

71
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,917
Well, that's something
to work toward.

72
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:21,542
Oh, that sounds
oddly patronizing.

73
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:22,834
No. Wait, wait.

74
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,875
You're saying
you don't think

75
00:03:24,917 --> 00:03:27,250
that she can get there or...?

76
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:30,792
It's important to understand
our limitations.

77
00:03:30,834 --> 00:03:32,041
That goes for all of us.

78
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,875
You're not listening.
I'm not crazy.

79
00:03:34,917 --> 00:03:39,000
This is me. I'm back now,
and there's nothing I can't do.

80
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,041
As Amy has told you,

81
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,792
gliosarcomas
are very aggressive tumors

82
00:03:47,834 --> 00:03:49,291
that don't respond well
to treatment.

83
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:50,291
And what's the plan?

84
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,083
We're gonna insert
vascular balloons

85
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,709
into your brain and bypass
the large blood vessel

86
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,250
that's infiltrated
by the tumor.

87
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,458
Our hope is to preserve

88
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,417
the healthy brain tissue
and remove the tumor.

89
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:00,417
What's the catch?

90
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,625
We only have 90 seconds
to do it.

91
00:04:03,667 --> 00:04:04,667
What?

92
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:06,166
After 90 seconds with no blood,

93
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,458
Erica's brain tissue
starts to die.

94
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,875
We'd be causing a stroke.

95
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,041
Ninety seconds.

96
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,041
Can you do that?

97
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,041
Not alone.
But working together--

98
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,291
they've done it
in the practice suite. Twice.

99
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,333
- Twice.
- Twice so far,

100
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:24,333
and we'll keep practicing.

101
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:25,542
Erica, I'm not gonna
lie to you,

102
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:26,667
this has never been done.

103
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:28,875
It's risky.
But I believe we can do it.

104
00:04:28,917 --> 00:04:31,208
Maybe you wanna take
a few more days to practice.

105
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,667
Try and get that number up.

106
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:34,125
Unfortunately,
time is critical.

107
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,041
We have to remove the tumor
before it's too big.

108
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,750
When?
Today.

109
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,333
You wanna try surgery on me

110
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:44,041
that's never been successful
today?

111
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,041
And if you fail,
my brain dies.

112
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,291
That's what we're saying?

113
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,542
You have
two world-class surgeons

114
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:53,750
telling you you have a chance.
Two days ago you had none.

115
00:04:53,792 --> 00:04:57,083
You have to take that chance.

116
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,583
I need a day.

117
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:01,333
I have a son who's stuck
watching TV with the nurse

118
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:06,709
with no idea what's happening,
so, ahem, I need a day.

119
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,000
Okay.

120
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,709
Book the or.
First thing tomorrow.

121
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:23,500
On my count. One, two...

122
00:05:23,542 --> 00:05:25,000
Dr. Bennett,
we were watching TV,

123
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,500
then Gloria
couldn't catch her breath.

124
00:05:26,542 --> 00:05:27,917
Sudden onset of dyspnea.

125
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:30,625
No associated chest pain
or palpitations. Tachy at 120.

126
00:05:30,667 --> 00:05:33,125
Cardiac panel, enzymes,
portable chest.

127
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,917
She's also
30 weeks pregnant.

128
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,792
What? She's pregnant?
She didn't wanna tell you.

129
00:05:37,834 --> 00:05:39,709
Because you knew
it wasn't supposed to happen.

130
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,917
I'm so sorry.

131
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,291
High flow O2, 100 percent.

132
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,041
Dr. Bennett.
What's going on?

133
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,917
She's in congestive
heart failure.

134
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,917
What are you doing here?
I'm the ivf doctor.

135
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:51,792
Dr. Reilly gave us our baby.
Wait, what were you thinking?

136
00:05:51,834 --> 00:05:54,083
You know how dangerous it is
for her to carry a baby now.

137
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:56,041
It was routine.
No contraindications.

138
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,792
Well, I gave her
a donor heart.

139
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:01,041
Started working with her
before I joined the practice.

140
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,458
She never mentioned
anything.

141
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,458
Don't you do physical
examinations on patients

142
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,041
before you knock them up?
I do a gynecological exam.

143
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,041
Gloria's was normal. She--

144
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,041
I expect my patients
to be forthright

145
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,041
with their health.
She wasn't.

146
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,583
Fine.
You can rely on whatever--

147
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:16,208
oh. Am I interrupting?
Yes.

148
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,834
No. Jake did ivf on one
of my heart transplant patients.

149
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,041
Not knowingly.

150
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,041
Well, that is either crazy
or irresponsible.

151
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:23,125
Could you please
back me up on this?

152
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,041
I just came in
to get a yogurt.

153
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,041
- No, no. Weigh in on this.
- Addie, no, no.

154
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,625
I helped out a patient
who lied

155
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:30,041
that she had
no preexisting conditions.

156
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:31,917
After he happened to miss

157
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,500
the zipper scar right down
the middle of her chest.

158
00:06:33,542 --> 00:06:35,375
I don't ask my patients
to disrobe entirely

159
00:06:35,417 --> 00:06:37,375
when I'm doing
a routine fertility evaluation.

160
00:06:37,417 --> 00:06:39,041
Do you? Want me to start?
Okay.

161
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,291
It doesn't matter
how we got here.

162
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,041
What matters
is keeping your patient alive

163
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,583
and giving the baby
a fighting chance.

164
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,458
She's 30 weeks.
That's viable.

165
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,500
We deliver now--

166
00:06:46,542 --> 00:06:47,875
we know
there's a big difference

167
00:06:47,917 --> 00:06:49,709
between viable and healthy.
We can't wait.

168
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,041
We need to give this baby
a chance.

169
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,041
Gloria could die.

170
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,667
She's persistently
hypotensive,

171
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:55,166
she could be rejecting
the donor heart.

172
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:56,667
It could be something else.

173
00:06:56,709 --> 00:06:58,458
That is a chance that
I don't think we should take.

174
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:01,291
Sam's right.

175
00:07:08,542 --> 00:07:10,041
You gonna eat that
or frame it?

176
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:12,917
It's a little thing called
attention to detail, my friend.

177
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,083
Oh, Violet, hello. Look.
Hey.

178
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,125
Hi.
Hello.

179
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,041
I'm sorry. I just need

180
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,166
to get that juice.
Whoops. Heh, heh.

181
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,250
Kind of in a rush.
Okay.

182
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,750
All right. See you.
Uh-huh.

183
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:34,583
That wasn't awkward at all.

184
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,750
You got it.

185
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,291
Come on, dad.

186
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,667
Charlotte throws harder
than you do.

187
00:07:47,709 --> 00:07:49,166
Come on.
Less chatty, more throwy.

188
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,917
You know what?
I think it's gonna rain again.

189
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,166
I think we should go.

190
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,041
We're not scared
of a little rain, are we?

191
00:07:57,083 --> 00:08:00,041
It's more the threat
of pneumonia and lightning.

192
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:03,041
Mas, I think you might be right.
Your dad might be a wuss.

193
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,583
Go long.

194
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:13,625
Mom, did you see that?

195
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,959
You all right?
Would you be?

196
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Mom, what's wrong?
Are you okay?

197
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:28,709
I'm not okay, honey.

198
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:33,083
I'm sick. And I'm sure
you've noticed that.

199
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:37,000
And I should have talked to you
about it before because

200
00:08:38,542 --> 00:08:39,709
I'm really sick.

201
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,959
What do you mean?

202
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:44,542
What's wrong with you?

203
00:08:46,834 --> 00:08:49,000
There's a tumor in her brain,
Mason.

204
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,834
Mom,

205
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,083
you're not gonna die,
are you?

206
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,625
I hope not.

207
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:09,208
I really, really hope not.

208
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,709
How long have you been sick?

209
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:17,041
A long time.

210
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,500
Why didn't you tell me?

211
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:21,750
Why didn't you tell me
you might die?

212
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,041
Mason. Mason.

213
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,417
We're doing everything
that we can.

214
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,041
She should have told me.

215
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:30,959
Mason.
Here, I'll go. I'll go.

216
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,041
Hey. What were
you doing before?

217
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,166
What do you mean?

218
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,166
With Corinne.
You were being patronizing.

219
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:51,542
And a little pessimistic.
No, Sam, I was being realistic.

220
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,125
Corinne's behavior felt--

221
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:56,083
her speech was pressured,
she was highly energized.

222
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,458
Her thoughts were expansive.

223
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,041
That's Corinne.
It's also hypomania.

224
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:03,041
All right, so...

225
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,417
So she's a bit manic.

226
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:07,875
Which could easily precede
full-blown mania and--

227
00:10:07,917 --> 00:10:10,125
that's a freight train.
At least she's not depressed.

228
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,542
If my gut is right,
that'll happen later.

229
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,041
What?
I'm not prepared

230
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,834
to confirm a diagnosis, Sam.

231
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,333
But it's very clear to me
that Corinne is sick.

232
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,959
Probably since
she was a teenager.

233
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,458
And the last two decades
have been a spiral of descent.

234
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,041
I didn't hear her say that.

235
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,375
I'm trained to listen to
what isn't said.

236
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:28,792
My sister being happy
isn't a disease, Sheldon.

237
00:10:28,834 --> 00:10:31,291
It-- look,
when Corinne left,

238
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,041
even when it was bad,

239
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:37,500
she was in my blood,
she was a huge part of my life.

240
00:10:37,542 --> 00:10:40,917
And when she walked out
that door,

241
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,291
a part of me died
and I buried it,

242
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:46,041
along with
all my memories of her.

243
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,750
But now...

244
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:52,709
I don't know.
I think that she is back.

245
00:10:53,792 --> 00:10:55,166
My sister is back.

246
00:10:56,834 --> 00:10:59,917
Well, Dr. Bennett thinks
you should have a c-section now.

247
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,166
It'll put the least amount
of strain on your heart.

248
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,041
It's too soon for the baby.

249
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,834
Do you really think
delivering at 30 weeks is ideal?

250
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,125
Look, you're not wrong.

251
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:11,166
It will put your baby at risk
for developmental problems.

252
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,417
But waiting
might not be an option.

253
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,041
We've been through
so much to--

254
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,041
to give up now
and just hope

255
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,750
that our premature baby
survives--

256
00:11:18,792 --> 00:11:20,166
We were wrong to deceive you,

257
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,208
but no matter
what Dr. Bennett says,

258
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,291
we won't do a c-section.

259
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:25,500
Not now.

260
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,208
Hey. Thanks.

261
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,875
Okay, remember I was telling you
about that sex I was having?

262
00:11:34,917 --> 00:11:36,875
That unattached, x-rated,
filthy, hot--

263
00:11:36,917 --> 00:11:38,208
yes, I remember.

264
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,166
I think
I may have screwed it up.

265
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,875
Scott said he wants more.

266
00:11:41,917 --> 00:11:43,542
What did you say?
Nothing.

267
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,667
What did he say?
I just rolled on top of him

268
00:11:46,709 --> 00:11:48,375
and shut him up.

269
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:50,792
Interesting strategy.

270
00:11:50,834 --> 00:11:52,875
I just--
I don't know what I want.

271
00:11:52,917 --> 00:11:54,041
Yeah, join the club.

272
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:56,250
I slept with Sam.
What?

273
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,625
I was all jazzed up
about saving that baby

274
00:11:58,667 --> 00:12:00,208
and he was all spun out
about Corinne.

275
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,417
One thing led to another...

276
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:02,458
Are you guys
getting back together?

277
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,917
No.

278
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:05,250
Because you wanna
throw yourself at Jake again?

279
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,375
No, no, definitely not.

280
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:08,041
All I get from that guy
is frostbite.

281
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,667
Ahem. What about--?

282
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:11,583
You know,
what about you and Pete?

283
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:14,667
Ah... when I think about going
back into that situation, i--

284
00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:17,041
no, he hasn't changed.
Nothing's changed, so no.

285
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,375
And as for Scott,

286
00:12:18,417 --> 00:12:20,625
look, look, I am a mother,
I have a full-time job.

287
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:23,041
I have no business getting
into a real relationship.

288
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:27,041
Do you like him? I mean,
apart from the filthy, hot sex?

289
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,709
He's good. He's kind.

290
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,458
He rubs my feet
when we watch TV.

291
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,875
There's nothing wrong
with having fun.

292
00:12:32,917 --> 00:12:34,041
If that's what
feels right for you,

293
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,458
then don't change a thing.

294
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,041
Chocolate malted.

295
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,083
And a coffee too please.
Regular.

296
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,667
Mmm.

297
00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:47,250
Thank you. Keep the change.

298
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,750
It's mom's favorite.

299
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:54,542
She's all right,
you know. Mom.

300
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,667
I was afraid to ask.

301
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,041
It's been so long,
I thought maybe--

302
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,625
no, no, no, she's fine.
She's healthy, retired.

303
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:03,709
She's got a companion
named James.

304
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:08,458
Our mother is getting--
no, no, no. They just--

305
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,750
they go out to dinners,
he fixes stuff around the house.

306
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:14,041
Ha, ha! Sure, he does.
Ugh.

307
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:16,959
Come on. That's nasty.

308
00:13:20,542 --> 00:13:23,583
Did she ever talk about me?

309
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:28,041
Yeah, yeah. Uh...

310
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,083
In the beginning.

311
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,041
But, you know,
then it got tough for her,

312
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,291
more than she could take.

313
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:36,041
After a while--
she forgot about me.

314
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:39,500
No. You were always there.

315
00:13:39,542 --> 00:13:41,291
For both of us.

316
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,333
We should call her.

317
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,125
I can't.

318
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,000
Not yet. I mean, you know,

319
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:53,000
this has already been a lot,
you know. I'm not ready, okay?

320
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,041
Okay. All right.

321
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:59,041
Mm.

322
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,667
Oh, no.

323
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:03,291
No, I still haven't
please.

324
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,041
Gotten over the PTSD

325
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,208
from the last time
you t-boned me.

326
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,709
No, it's been forever.

327
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,500
I'm a grown--
let it go. Come on.

328
00:14:09,542 --> 00:14:11,041
Come with me right now.

329
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,959
You're going.

330
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,875
Done.
Done.

331
00:14:20,917 --> 00:14:22,041
Ninety-two seconds.

332
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,125
Damn it.
Son of a bitch.

333
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,041
You did it five times straight
in under 90.

334
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,041
We don't practice
until you can do it right.

335
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:29,417
You practice
until you can't do it wrong.

336
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,166
Okay. Go again.

337
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,000
How's Erica?

338
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:41,250
Sleeping or trying to.

339
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:42,458
I don't know
how you'd fall asleep

340
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,458
the night before you...

341
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,500
I did this wrong.
I just-- I did it

342
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,875
all wrong.
How so?

343
00:14:51,917 --> 00:14:53,667
Dragging Erica up here

344
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:55,083
for some hail Mary surgery

345
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,417
that our friends
are gonna perform.

346
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,041
They don't even know
if they can pull off.

347
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:00,291
All I can do is pace around,

348
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:03,000
thinking through
every awful eventuality.

349
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,041
And my son is trapped
in a front-row seat

350
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,166
for whatever happens, and you?
You didn't ask for any of it

351
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,166
and you're trapped
in the middle of a horror show.

352
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,041
Coop, breathe.

353
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,875
No, I can't breathe, Charlotte.
That's--

354
00:15:12,917 --> 00:15:17,875
I can't breathe because I feel
like I screwed everything up,

355
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,250
in the worst possible way.

356
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,041
You didn't screw it up.

357
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:24,000
You did the best you could.

358
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,542
Tell me it's gonna be okay.

359
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,709
Coop.
I'm not asking for a fairy tale.

360
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,542
I'm just saying,
no matter what happens,

361
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:42,709
it's gonna be okay.

362
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,125
With worst case
and she dies,

363
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:45,291
I mean, it's gonna be okay.

364
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:46,917
Like we can do this,
we can raise this kid,

365
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,583
you can be a mother.

366
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:51,500
Just say it's gonna be okay.

367
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,291
Okay.

368
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,959
It's gonna be okay.

369
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,709
So they're gonna be coming

370
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,333
to take you to the or
in a couple minutes and, uh...

371
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,917
How you feeling?

372
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:23,166
Okay.

373
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:26,750
But they keep it
a little cold in here,

374
00:16:26,792 --> 00:16:28,834
don't you think, baby?

375
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,917
Mason, please don't be mad
at your mom right now.

376
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:36,125
No, he gets to be mad.

377
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:38,959
Mason, look at me.

378
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,291
You get to be mad.

379
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,083
You get to have
all of your feelings.

380
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:48,000
As long as you know, you have
to know, that I love you.

381
00:16:49,417 --> 00:16:50,834
Come here.

382
00:16:59,792 --> 00:17:03,166
I love you more than anything
in this whole stupid world. Heh.

383
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,875
And I always will,
from wherever I am.

384
00:17:05,917 --> 00:17:08,458
Even if you're mad at me.

385
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,041
You know that, don't you?

386
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,250
Now, I need you
to go with your dad.

387
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:23,625
Because I have to talk
to Charlotte for a second, okay?

388
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:27,000
You can eat as much junk food
as you want today.

389
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:31,875
It's okay.

390
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,041
What can I do for you?

391
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,917
Teach him
how to drive a stick.

392
00:17:46,959 --> 00:17:48,709
Before you ever let him drive
an automatic,

393
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,083
teach him
how to drive a stick

394
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,250
so then he'll never
be stranded, okay?

395
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,875
Okay.
Don't push him too hard

396
00:17:53,917 --> 00:17:55,250
on his grades.
He's smart like Cooper,

397
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:58,000
but he's too hard
on himself,

398
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,333
so don't add to that, okay?

399
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,083
Okay.
And talk about me.

400
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:06,083
You'll be his mom, but--
no.

401
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:07,834
You will always be his mama.

402
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:10,083
Whatever happens.

403
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:13,041
Always.
He needs a living mom.

404
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:17,125
He'll need you.
You get that?

405
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,750
Cooper's not enough.

406
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:22,500
He'll need you.

407
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:25,917
They're doing
the surgery today?

408
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:28,041
Okay. Well, yeah.

409
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:30,041
Call or text or do something

410
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,667
as soon as you know
anything, okay?

411
00:18:31,709 --> 00:18:34,542
All right. Love to everyone.

412
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,500
Wow, that was fast.

413
00:18:36,542 --> 00:18:39,041
How are Charlotte and Cooper
holding up?

414
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,208
Trying.

415
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:43,250
Oh, hey, do you have
plans tonight?

416
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,875
Do I have plans tonight?

417
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:49,083
Yeah. I was wondering if
I could come by and see Lucas.

418
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:52,917
If you're busy, then I'll--

419
00:18:52,959 --> 00:18:55,333
no, no, no. That's fine.
That's fine. Yes.

420
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,083
Hey. Do you have a second?

421
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:10,000
I'm kind of busy right now.

422
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:21,041
I'm sorry that
I didn't back you up with Sam.

423
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:24,041
Well, no surprise there,
right?

424
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:26,041
Look, you know what--

425
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,625
what happened with Sam
was a one-time thing.

426
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,625
And I am quite capable

427
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:32,041
of separating
my personal feelings

428
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,417
from my professional
opinions.

429
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,208
Gloria fought the odds
to become a mother.

430
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,417
You know, maybe unwisely,

431
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:38,041
but she's earned the right

432
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,333
to put the life of her baby
ahead of her own.

433
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,208
No matter what we think,
she has that right.

434
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,917
But Sam said--
Sam isn't her ivf specialist.

435
00:19:44,959 --> 00:19:46,208
All right?
And neither are you.

436
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,208
Anything else?

437
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,041
You can do this.

438
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:12,458
There's no margin for error.

439
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,041
There's no margin
for self-doubt.

440
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,583
You think I don't
know that?

441
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:20,709
I'll see you
in the or.

442
00:20:25,834 --> 00:20:27,917
The last time I operated
on a friend, I was out of it.

443
00:20:27,959 --> 00:20:30,417
It's a miracle
nothing went wrong.

444
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:33,291
I mean, what if my karmic
payback is now and Erica dies?

445
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,709
I know you're scared.
That's good.

446
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,875
Well, how is that different
from having self-doubt?

447
00:20:37,917 --> 00:20:40,041
You don't doubt your skills
as a surgeon.

448
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,000
I wouldn't let you
scrub in if you did.

449
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,583
I don't--
I don't see the difference--

450
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,709
after dad died,

451
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,041
any time
there was a loud noise,

452
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,500
like a gunshot,
you'd jump out of your skin.

453
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:53,875
You got ahold
of these firecrackers.

454
00:20:53,917 --> 00:20:56,041
I found you in the yard
and you were setting them off

455
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:59,709
one at a time
until you didn't jump anymore.

456
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,041
When you're scared,
you fight.

457
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,500
You face your fear
and you fight.

458
00:21:03,542 --> 00:21:04,500
And you fight to win.

459
00:21:04,542 --> 00:21:05,709
Your fight is much stronger

460
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,959
than any karmic payback.

461
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,333
You got this, Amy.

462
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:12,750
We got this.

463
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,750
Hey.
Whoa.

464
00:21:18,792 --> 00:21:20,208
I thought we'd have
stir-fry tonight.

465
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,250
This is adventurous.

466
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:23,667
When did you learn
how to cook?

467
00:21:23,709 --> 00:21:25,417
Couple years ago.

468
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,834
There's this dive on pico
in venice.

469
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,417
The chef took pity on me.

470
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:32,959
Let me watch in the kitchen
and eat the leftovers.

471
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,041
Wait. A couple years ago?
That-- you must mean...

472
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,959
Wait, how--?

473
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,291
How long you been here
in L.A.?

474
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,083
It's, um...

475
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,750
It's complicated.
Corinne.

476
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,208
How long you been here?

477
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,709
You know, there's a shelter
on Santa Monica.

478
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,083
I'm just gonna go--
wait. Don't-- don't--

479
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:57,041
don't avoid me.
Don't run away.

480
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,000
Just answer my question.

481
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:03,000
Five-- five-- five years.

482
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,041
Do you have any idea

483
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:13,625
what it's been like for me?

484
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:16,417
For mom? We--

485
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:19,583
we thought you were dead.

486
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:20,625
Do you get that?

487
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:25,333
Hey! We thought
you were dead!

488
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:27,583
After ten years,
we had a funeral for you.

489
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:29,750
Your name
was on a headstone.

490
00:22:29,792 --> 00:22:31,583
Sam, i--
don't. Stop.

491
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:34,750
Because I had to watch
our mother broken.

492
00:22:34,792 --> 00:22:37,041
She was destroyed.

493
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:40,041
And me? How could you
do that to me?

494
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:41,834
To us?

495
00:22:42,834 --> 00:22:45,041
It's not about you.
How could it be?

496
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:47,667
It's always been about you!

497
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:51,458
What happened
to my baby sister?

498
00:22:52,834 --> 00:22:55,041
You don't wanna know.

499
00:22:58,291 --> 00:23:00,667
You're right,
I don't wanna know.

500
00:23:01,792 --> 00:23:03,041
All this was so much easier

501
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:06,667
when we thought
you were dead.

502
00:23:17,709 --> 00:23:20,291
Last night, I was

503
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:23,667
laying down
in Sam's guest room

504
00:23:23,709 --> 00:23:26,583
and I was fantasizing
about an earthquake.

505
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:30,417
Not one that would hurt
anyone else.

506
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:34,417
Just enough to make
the piece of roof above my head

507
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:36,250
fall and crack
my skull open.

508
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:37,959
To what end?

509
00:23:39,959 --> 00:23:41,041
I'm not sure.

510
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:45,250
I don't know if I just wanted
the pain to stop

511
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:50,417
or if I wished I could finally
feel something real.

512
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:52,917
But then again, I don't--

513
00:23:52,959 --> 00:23:54,333
I don't even know
what's real.

514
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:56,208
All of it is.

515
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,041
Everything you feel.

516
00:23:58,083 --> 00:24:02,500
So I am a waste of skin.

517
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:05,041
Corinne.
For what I did to Sam,

518
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:07,000
to my mother,

519
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:10,041
I should be taken out
back and shot.

520
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:11,709
This is not your fault.

521
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,041
You're suffering
from a disorder.

522
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:15,458
It's called--
does it matter what it's called?

523
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,041
Because whatever
you think it is,

524
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:18,083
there's a drug for it.

525
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:20,041
And I'm pretty sure
I've taken it before

526
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,166
and it didn't work.

527
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:25,667
What's happening with you,

528
00:24:25,709 --> 00:24:28,041
what's been happening
all these years,

529
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:29,083
is bigger than you.

530
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:33,000
And every day a battle
is fought in your mind.

531
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:34,750
And with
repeated misdiagnoses,

532
00:24:34,792 --> 00:24:36,041
and the lack
of proper treatment,

533
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:39,250
and the instability
of your life,

534
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:40,917
all those things
have made it worse.

535
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:45,000
You're suffering
from bipolar disorder.

536
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:49,041
And right now,
you feel like you can't go on,

537
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:52,667
but I'm telling you--
I'm tired, Dr. Wallace.

538
00:24:52,709 --> 00:24:54,750
I'm so tired.

539
00:24:57,542 --> 00:25:01,000
Why'd this happen to me?
I was so smart.

540
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,792
I got a's in everything.

541
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,083
I could do everything.

542
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:09,750
My junior year in high school,
everyone wanted to be me.

543
00:25:09,792 --> 00:25:14,375
And then one day,
it was all gone.

544
00:25:14,417 --> 00:25:17,250
I can only imagine
how hard that would be.

545
00:25:18,792 --> 00:25:21,083
But the Corinne of yesterday

546
00:25:21,125 --> 00:25:23,500
did a load of laundry,
and organized some books

547
00:25:23,542 --> 00:25:25,542
and went on a run.

548
00:25:25,583 --> 00:25:29,041
And if you can
endure bottoms,

549
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:31,041
there will be tops
that will allow you

550
00:25:31,083 --> 00:25:33,041
to shine and to thrive.

551
00:25:33,083 --> 00:25:36,792
And with the proper medications,
and diet and sleep,

552
00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:41,959
we can try to turn down
the intensity of the swings

553
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,041
and help you achieve
your own normalcy.

554
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:47,750
But you have to be patient

555
00:25:47,792 --> 00:25:50,041
and you have to
let me help you.

556
00:25:53,667 --> 00:25:54,834
The graft is ready.

557
00:25:54,875 --> 00:25:56,542
Ready to inflate?

558
00:25:56,583 --> 00:25:58,959
Timer on. Ninety seconds.

559
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,041
- Ready?
- Ready.

560
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:01,917
One, two, three, go.

561
00:26:48,792 --> 00:26:49,959
- Done.
- It's in.

562
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:52,041
Eighty-five seconds!

563
00:26:52,083 --> 00:26:54,041
Sorry, 85 seconds.

564
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:55,875
New record. You did it.

565
00:26:55,917 --> 00:26:57,041
We did it.

566
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:58,083
We did it.

567
00:26:58,125 --> 00:27:00,375
Okay, good.
Moving on.

568
00:27:00,417 --> 00:27:02,083
Let's excise
the infiltrated vessels.

569
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:07,625
Uh, pressure's going
through the roof.

570
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:10,000
- The artery is non-pulsatile.
- She's thrown a clot.

571
00:27:10,041 --> 00:27:11,625
Damn it, she's stroking out.

572
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:15,458
You know what that is?

573
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,709
It's a brain.

574
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,000
It's your mama's brain.

575
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,583
And that is the tumor
growing inside it.

576
00:27:23,625 --> 00:27:26,709
So the doctors have to cut into
her head to get it out?

577
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,792
Mm-hm.

578
00:27:27,834 --> 00:27:30,000
So how are they gonna do it?

579
00:27:30,041 --> 00:27:32,875
Well, first they'll cut out
a section of her skull

580
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:36,041
and dissect the brain
so that they can see the tumor.

581
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:38,083
And they'll separate the tumor
from surrounding tissue

582
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:39,250
before removing it.

583
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:41,041
If everything
turns out right,

584
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:42,917
they'll close her up.

585
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:46,792
But what could go wrong?

586
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,500
There are risks
with any brain surgery.

587
00:27:51,542 --> 00:27:53,000
Your mom could
get a blood clot

588
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:55,041
or bleeding in the brain.

589
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:58,709
It might affect her speech,
her vision, her memory.

590
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:01,917
She might have a seizure
or a stroke.

591
00:28:01,959 --> 00:28:04,000
Or she could die
from the operation.

592
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:09,125
But that is why
we came to Seattle.

593
00:28:09,166 --> 00:28:11,500
We wanted your mama
to have the very best surgeons

594
00:28:11,542 --> 00:28:13,166
doing her operation.

595
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:17,333
You're telling me the truth?

596
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:18,542
This is all of it?

597
00:28:18,583 --> 00:28:21,375
Yes. This is all of it.

598
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:24,000
Thank you.

599
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,709
You're welcome.

600
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:40,583
Pressure's 179 over 105.

601
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:41,750
Shut the hell up. We know.

602
00:28:41,792 --> 00:28:42,792
The clot's jammed up

603
00:28:42,834 --> 00:28:44,041
against the proximal end
of the shunt.

604
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:45,041
I see it.

605
00:28:45,083 --> 00:28:47,041
I'm taking the shunt out.

606
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:48,458
Without it,
there's no blood supply.

607
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,083
We don't clear the clot,
she's dead. Do it.

608
00:28:50,125 --> 00:28:51,083
Microscissors.

609
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:52,166
Through the suture line.

610
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:55,000
Almost there.

611
00:28:57,208 --> 00:28:58,625
Got it.

612
00:28:58,667 --> 00:29:00,333
Pressure is--

613
00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:01,917
is what it is.

614
00:29:01,959 --> 00:29:04,500
Shunt's out now.

615
00:29:06,208 --> 00:29:08,041
That pretty much
cleared out the clot.

616
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:10,458
Good. Reinserting the shunt.

617
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:12,875
There.

618
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:16,583
The artery's pulsatile.

619
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:18,375
And pressure's coming down.

620
00:29:20,834 --> 00:29:22,500
Okay. Shall we continue?

621
00:29:22,542 --> 00:29:24,542
I need the graft

622
00:29:24,583 --> 00:29:26,875
and another microdriver.

623
00:29:26,917 --> 00:29:30,500
Just another five or six hours
to go. We're cruising now.

624
00:29:33,542 --> 00:29:35,542
That scared the crap out of me.
Yeah, me too.

625
00:29:37,083 --> 00:29:39,125
Corinne.

626
00:29:42,709 --> 00:29:45,041
Hey. Uh...

627
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:47,000
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

628
00:29:49,291 --> 00:29:53,083
Look, I just wanted
to apologize for this morning.

629
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,875
I didn't mean to yell.
Yes, you did.

630
00:29:55,917 --> 00:29:58,709
Because you are
the selfish one.

631
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:02,041
For the last 20 years,
everything in my head,

632
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:05,250
it's been big and bold.

633
00:30:05,291 --> 00:30:09,041
No whispers, just screams.

634
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:10,250
And I tried to deal with it.

635
00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:14,083
You know,
I felt responsible.

636
00:30:14,125 --> 00:30:16,291
I thought it was me.

637
00:30:16,333 --> 00:30:19,000
But you know what, Sam?
I'm sick.

638
00:30:19,041 --> 00:30:21,667
I'm the one
with bipolar disorder.

639
00:30:21,709 --> 00:30:23,875
So you can complain
all you want

640
00:30:23,917 --> 00:30:28,166
about how worried you were
and how worried mom was.

641
00:30:28,208 --> 00:30:31,375
And I feel bad about that,
I really do.

642
00:30:31,417 --> 00:30:35,291
But I was living it.

643
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,875
And I protected you
from the worst of it.

644
00:30:40,542 --> 00:30:44,333
While you were in med school,
I did my first stint in jail.

645
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:49,542
And while you were off
being a big, fancy doctor,

646
00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:51,709
I was eating garbage,

647
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,750
so I could have enough money
for drugs

648
00:30:53,792 --> 00:30:57,208
because that was the only way
to escape the pain.

649
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:02,917
And while you were having
a family and living in Malibu,

650
00:31:02,959 --> 00:31:05,250
I was selling my body

651
00:31:05,291 --> 00:31:08,000
just to survive.

652
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:13,208
So you missed me.

653
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:16,000
Poor you.

654
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:20,834
This isn't your journey,
it's mine.

655
00:31:20,875 --> 00:31:25,709
It is my pathetic life.

656
00:31:26,917 --> 00:31:29,041
And you might hate me.

657
00:31:29,083 --> 00:31:32,041
But guess what, Sam,
I hate me more.

658
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:36,417
And I can tell you
to go to hell.

659
00:31:36,458 --> 00:31:40,667
But having lived there
the past 20 years,

660
00:31:41,834 --> 00:31:44,625
I'm pretty sure
you can't handle it.

661
00:31:44,667 --> 00:31:47,875
And so screw you.

662
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:58,667
What happened?
She was fine

663
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:00,792
and then she just started
gasping for air again.

664
00:32:00,834 --> 00:32:02,000
Pulse ox is dropping.

665
00:32:02,041 --> 00:32:03,500
Up the nitro drip.

666
00:32:03,542 --> 00:32:04,917
Back 100 percent O2.

667
00:32:04,959 --> 00:32:06,041
Why is she
not getting better?

668
00:32:06,083 --> 00:32:07,083
I'm not sure.

669
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:09,291
We're gonna have to take you
to the cardio lab.

670
00:32:09,333 --> 00:32:11,041
We need to do
an endocardial biopsy.

671
00:32:11,083 --> 00:32:12,709
Figure out what's going on.

672
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,041
Is the procedure
safe for the baby?

673
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:16,667
The baby will be exposed
to radiation during the X-ray.

674
00:32:16,709 --> 00:32:18,667
The procedure could cause
precipitous labor.

675
00:32:18,709 --> 00:32:21,041
No. I'm not doing it.

676
00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:23,125
Gloria, listen to me.
She said no, Sam.

677
00:32:23,166 --> 00:32:25,500
She can't breathe. She'll die
if we don't do something.

678
00:32:25,542 --> 00:32:27,041
Give her another dose
of diuretics.

679
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:28,875
She's maxed out.
Put her on a pump.

680
00:32:28,917 --> 00:32:30,917
Jake, she is a year and a half
post-transplant.

681
00:32:30,959 --> 00:32:32,041
She's been doing fine.

682
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,875
I'm not just gonna
throw darts at a board.

683
00:32:33,917 --> 00:32:36,041
I have to figure out why
she's rejecting her heart now.

684
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:37,000
I know.

685
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:39,500
I'm sorry.

686
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,875
But I stopped taking
my immunosuppressant drugs

687
00:32:42,917 --> 00:32:44,125
when I got pregnant.

688
00:32:45,166 --> 00:32:46,333
Why would you do that?

689
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:47,917
They could hurt the baby.

690
00:32:47,959 --> 00:32:49,709
You shouldn't have done that.

691
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,041
Shouldn't have done
that on your own.

692
00:32:51,083 --> 00:32:52,083
Her water broke.

693
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:54,542
We gotta get her
into labor and delivery now.

694
00:32:54,583 --> 00:32:55,792
Move back there.

695
00:32:57,166 --> 00:32:58,667
Baby's coming too fast.

696
00:32:58,709 --> 00:33:00,041
Gloria,
I need you to stop pushing.

697
00:33:00,083 --> 00:33:02,041
I can't.
Try to slow your breathing.

698
00:33:02,083 --> 00:33:03,041
It hurts.

699
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:05,041
Gloria. You breathe with me.

700
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:06,041
Breathe with me.

701
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:07,041
Her pressure's dropping.

702
00:33:07,083 --> 00:33:08,041
Hurry up, Addison.

703
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,166
- What's going on?
- I'm losing her pulse.

704
00:33:11,208 --> 00:33:12,917
- Get ready to bag her.
- I'm on it.

705
00:33:12,959 --> 00:33:15,166
Get that baby out of there.

706
00:33:15,208 --> 00:33:16,375
Head's out.

707
00:33:16,417 --> 00:33:17,709
Anesthesia.

708
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,375
Thoracotomy tray.

709
00:33:19,417 --> 00:33:20,709
You're gonna crack open
her chest?

710
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:21,709
I have no choice.

711
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:22,917
Towel and cord clamp.

712
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:23,917
What do you need?

713
00:33:23,959 --> 00:33:24,917
Sternal saw.

714
00:33:24,959 --> 00:33:25,917
It's coming.

715
00:33:35,667 --> 00:33:36,875
All right. Spreader.

716
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,041
Addison, we're running
out of time.

717
00:33:40,083 --> 00:33:41,375
Got her. Scissors.

718
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:44,583
I can crank her open.

719
00:33:44,625 --> 00:33:46,083
Do it.

720
00:33:47,333 --> 00:33:49,125
- Damn it.
- What's going on?

721
00:33:49,166 --> 00:33:51,041
- Dissected her aorta.
- I need a cross-clamp.

722
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:52,750
Call perfusion for bypass.

723
00:33:52,792 --> 00:33:53,750
She's in fib.

724
00:33:53,792 --> 00:33:54,834
We're losing her.

725
00:33:54,875 --> 00:33:56,041
Almost there.

726
00:33:56,083 --> 00:33:57,542
Just give me a second.

727
00:33:57,583 --> 00:33:59,542
Erica.

728
00:33:59,583 --> 00:34:01,041
Erica.

729
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:03,792
It's Dr. Shepherd.
Can you hear me?

730
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:06,000
Mm. Hurts.

731
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:07,750
We'll get you something
for the pain.

732
00:34:07,792 --> 00:34:09,583
Can you wiggle
your toes for me?

733
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:13,750
And your fingers?
Both hands?

734
00:34:13,792 --> 00:34:15,792
Good. All right.

735
00:34:16,917 --> 00:34:19,250
We got the whole tumor.
All of it.

736
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:22,667
I lived? I'm alive?

737
00:34:22,709 --> 00:34:25,083
If this is heaven, sister,
I want my money back.

738
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:28,834
Ow. Hurt.

739
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:31,291
Pain medicine will kick in
in a second.

740
00:34:35,709 --> 00:34:38,709
Erica, Mason's looking
through the window.

741
00:34:39,917 --> 00:34:41,000
No. Don't raise your head.

742
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:45,083
Just wave. You can do it.

743
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:48,000
Lift your hand. Wave.

744
00:35:00,417 --> 00:35:01,792
Perfect.

745
00:35:01,834 --> 00:35:03,291
I'm alive.

746
00:35:15,083 --> 00:35:16,125
We did that.

747
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:18,417
We did that.
We gotta publish.

748
00:35:18,458 --> 00:35:19,917
Oh, hell, yeah, we do.

749
00:35:19,959 --> 00:35:21,125
If you ever think
about doing drugs again--

750
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:23,041
remember this?
I was gonna say call me.

751
00:35:23,083 --> 00:35:25,458
I'll fly down to Los Angeles
and knock some sense into you.

752
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,125
But, okay, remember this.
That doesn't work.

753
00:35:28,166 --> 00:35:30,041
Yeah, you can totally
kick my ass.

754
00:35:30,083 --> 00:35:31,250
Done.

755
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:35,583
I love you.

756
00:35:38,166 --> 00:35:40,333
She's so small,

757
00:35:40,375 --> 00:35:43,041
but she's perfect.

758
00:35:43,083 --> 00:35:46,709
Got ten little fingers
and ten little toes.

759
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,792
And her face looks

760
00:35:48,834 --> 00:35:51,834
just like you did
when you were younger.

761
00:35:53,959 --> 00:35:56,041
It's not a boy though,

762
00:35:56,083 --> 00:35:59,375
so I guess
we can't use the name Thomas.

763
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,959
We never really talked
about girls' names.

764
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,291
We should've talked
about girls' names.

765
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:10,750
She's gonna need
something strong.

766
00:36:10,792 --> 00:36:13,000
Like her mom.

767
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:24,083
We should've talked about
girls' names.

768
00:36:24,125 --> 00:36:26,458
We should've.

769
00:36:40,291 --> 00:36:41,667
What are you thinking about?

770
00:36:41,709 --> 00:36:43,709
Nothing.

771
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:46,709
Come on.

772
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:50,291
Um...

773
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:52,333
Well, I actually
was thinking

774
00:36:52,375 --> 00:36:53,333
about how bizarre
my life is.

775
00:36:53,375 --> 00:36:56,000
I live in a hotel.

776
00:36:56,041 --> 00:36:57,583
I...

777
00:36:57,625 --> 00:36:59,834
Uh...

778
00:36:59,875 --> 00:37:02,041
I'm having s-e-x
with a 29-year-old.

779
00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:06,166
And I had i-n-t-e-r-c-o-u-r-s-e
in an elevator.

780
00:37:06,208 --> 00:37:09,041
I know you did.
With an s-l-u-t.

781
00:37:10,458 --> 00:37:14,583
Yeah. These bars,
these women, it's not--

782
00:37:14,625 --> 00:37:16,041
they're not...

783
00:37:19,917 --> 00:37:21,625
You ever think a year ago,
we'd be--

784
00:37:21,667 --> 00:37:24,375
talking about having sex
with other people?

785
00:37:24,417 --> 00:37:26,542
No.

786
00:37:29,917 --> 00:37:32,750
Who are we?
I don't know.

787
00:37:41,542 --> 00:37:44,625
I love medicine!

788
00:37:47,709 --> 00:37:48,917
Seriously, I do.

789
00:37:48,959 --> 00:37:51,417
The whole medical field.
I'm in love with it.

790
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:53,625
I would marry it if I wasn't
already married to you.

791
00:37:53,667 --> 00:37:56,083
Well, I'm glad
I got to you first.

792
00:37:56,125 --> 00:37:57,959
Thank you.

793
00:38:00,583 --> 00:38:02,417
And thank you.

794
00:38:03,917 --> 00:38:05,834
I mean, you did not
sign up for this.

795
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:07,000
I love him.

796
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:09,458
Mason.

797
00:38:10,583 --> 00:38:12,041
I didn't think I could.

798
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:14,458
I mean, I didn't think
I would, but...

799
00:38:17,083 --> 00:38:19,000
When I thought
his mama might die...

800
00:38:21,792 --> 00:38:23,542
I love him.

801
00:38:26,333 --> 00:38:28,333
And I think it's--

802
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:32,792
I think it's because
I love you so damn much.

803
00:38:34,625 --> 00:38:36,166
I love you, Cooper.

804
00:38:36,208 --> 00:38:38,917
So damn much.
I love you.

805
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:49,333
I like you.

806
00:38:50,333 --> 00:38:52,333
You make me feel...

807
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:57,417
You have reminded me
that I can laugh

808
00:38:57,458 --> 00:39:00,000
and smile

809
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:02,041
and be fun

810
00:39:02,083 --> 00:39:05,583
and not think about anything
but being close to you.

811
00:39:05,625 --> 00:39:07,875
And that is

812
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,792
so, so nice.

813
00:39:13,125 --> 00:39:15,041
I don't want more.

814
00:39:15,083 --> 00:39:17,041
I don't have more.

815
00:39:18,417 --> 00:39:22,000
So it's either incredible,

816
00:39:22,959 --> 00:39:24,792
unattached,

817
00:39:25,917 --> 00:39:30,417
mind-numbing sex or nothing.

818
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,166
I'll take it.

819
00:39:51,709 --> 00:39:52,917
Tell me something.

820
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:57,041
Am I reading too much into

821
00:39:57,083 --> 00:39:58,166
all of this?

822
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:00,583
Into...?
You and me.

823
00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:04,041
The grocery store,
Fiji, palm Springs.

824
00:40:04,083 --> 00:40:07,041
Am I reading too much
into that?

825
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:10,500
Was it purely physical

826
00:40:12,083 --> 00:40:13,625
or is it--?

827
00:40:13,667 --> 00:40:15,458
Is there something
emotional here?

828
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:19,583
For me?
Yeah.

829
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,333
For you.

830
00:40:23,208 --> 00:40:25,625
It's not just physical.

831
00:40:30,083 --> 00:40:31,709
Okay.

832
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,792
I figured...

833
00:41:02,166 --> 00:41:04,291
I thought that
you left because of me.

834
00:41:05,291 --> 00:41:07,959
That time when I told mom

835
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,959
that I didn't want a party
for my birthday

836
00:41:13,083 --> 00:41:15,458
because I didn't want you
to ruin it

837
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:18,291
just like everything else.

838
00:41:18,333 --> 00:41:20,583
I turned around

839
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:25,583
and you were standing there
and I know that you heard me.

840
00:41:27,125 --> 00:41:29,041
And a week later,
you were gone.

841
00:41:29,083 --> 00:41:31,792
I didn't leave because of you,
Sam.

842
00:41:31,834 --> 00:41:35,291
I left because I was sick.

843
00:41:35,333 --> 00:41:38,125
You didn't cause this.

844
00:41:38,166 --> 00:41:41,000
You didn't make this happen.

845
00:41:55,125 --> 00:41:57,709
And you'd think that that would
be a depressing thought.

846
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:00,208
That there's no end
to all of the...

847
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:02,291
I don't know.
That it doesn't get easier,

848
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:03,542
that it just gets different.

849
00:42:03,583 --> 00:42:05,291
But it's not. It is not.

850
00:42:05,333 --> 00:42:09,041
It's the opposite of depressing.
There's a relief in it.

851
00:42:09,083 --> 00:42:11,917
Life is complex. There's nothing
simple or easy about it.

852
00:42:11,959 --> 00:42:15,458
So I can stop waiting
for it to--

853
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,125
I can stop waiting.

854
00:42:18,166 --> 00:42:21,125
And I can just

855
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:22,834
live.
