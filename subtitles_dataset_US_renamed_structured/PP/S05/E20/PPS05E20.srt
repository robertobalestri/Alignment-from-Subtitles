00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,417
born in this hospital
with us taking care of him.

178
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,583
And you weigh that against
reina taking him to a place

179
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,166
where it's gonna be tough
to find clean water--

180
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:12,542
believe me, I'm not arguing
against birth mothers

181
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,000
putting their babies
in a position

182
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,041
to have a better life.

183
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,667
That's why I have Henry.

184
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,542
It's just--it's not right
that we're discussing

185
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,375
delivering a baby prematurely

186
00:06:20,417 --> 00:06:22,417
so that he doesn't
live in poverty.

187
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:23,625
It's an awful choice.

188
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:25,417
It is, but, Addison,
I worked in El Salvador,

189
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,542
and I'm telling you,
in rural areas,

190
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,166
there is minimal access
to health care.

191
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,792
The infant mortality rate
is triple ours.

192
00:06:31,834 --> 00:06:33,041
Which is a tragedy,

193
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,041
but there's not a lot
we can do about that here.

194
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:36,625
We're in the business
of making sick people better

195
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:39,166
and delivering babies for women
who are ready to give birth.

196
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,166
Now right now, reina doesn't
fit in either box.

197
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:42,792
So either
we discharge her--

198
00:06:42,834 --> 00:06:45,041
- or deliver the baby right now.
- Despite the fact that

199
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,625
it's clearly
not what's best for the baby?

200
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:47,834
Isn't that reina's call?

201
00:06:55,542 --> 00:06:57,041
Hi.

202
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,041
Good to see you.

203
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,291
Good to see you.

204
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:00,583
Hey, Dr. Cooper.
Hey.

205
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:01,667
Mel.

206
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:05,041
So melody has been miserable
all week.

207
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:06,625
First it was her throat,

208
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:09,709
then she stopped eating,
now her ears hurt.

209
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,875
Okay, that's a lot
of symptoms.

210
00:07:10,917 --> 00:07:12,417
And we tried
the over-the-counter stuff,

211
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:14,041
but nothing worked.

212
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,959
She just seems
to be getting worse.
All right.

213
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,750
Well, Mel,
let's check you out.

214
00:07:17,792 --> 00:07:20,500
All right, I'll, uh,
I'll wait here.

215
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:23,959
I don't need you
to come in with me, mom.

216
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,875
I'm not a baby.

217
00:07:26,917 --> 00:07:28,041
You know what, Pam?

218
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,250
Why don't I check out Mel,

219
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:30,875
and if we do need you,
we'll come get you?

220
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,709
How are you feeling?

221
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,750
Tired.

222
00:07:40,792 --> 00:07:42,041
Huge.

223
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,542
Well, your weight gain
is right where it should be

224
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:46,083
for the third trimester.

225
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,542
Any problems,
any g.I. Or g.U. Complaints?

226
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,959
No,
everything feels normal...

227
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,083
Which just seems cruel.

228
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,667
Should I...

229
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,500
Is there anything
I should be doing

230
00:07:58,542 --> 00:08:02,125
to help my baby reach
the optimal birth weight...

231
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,375
For the transplants?

232
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:04,583
Well, you're doing it.

233
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,041
You're resting.
You're eating right.

234
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,750
If you keep taking care
of yourself,

235
00:08:07,792 --> 00:08:12,166
this, uh, this baby will be
able to help a lot of others.

236
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:16,125
And when it's time for me
to deliver?

237
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:18,125
Well, my hope is that you'll
deliver naturally at term,

238
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:21,041
but sometimes women
carrying anencephalic babies

239
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,041
don't always get
the signal from their bodies

240
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,208
to go into labor.

241
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,500
If that happens,
I'll induce,

242
00:08:26,542 --> 00:08:27,709
once the baby is born,
I'll--

243
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,041
I'll have you sign
the consent forms,

244
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:32,542
and then the transplant team
will take over.

245
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:36,959
Everybody at the practice
is looking at me now, you know?

246
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,333
Like they're afraid to
say anything to the crazy lady

247
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,583
who's carrying a baby
with no brain to term.

248
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:44,041
I'm sure they all want
to support you.

249
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,792
Maybe if you let them know
what the plan is, that...

250
00:08:46,834 --> 00:08:48,583
No.

251
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:49,834
I just...

252
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:53,208
I can't handle talking about
this with anyone but you.

253
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:55,792
Okay?

254
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:58,041
Okay.

255
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:08,041
Hey.
Hey.

256
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:10,000
Thank you for watching Henry.

257
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,875
I-I really appreciate it.

258
00:09:11,917 --> 00:09:13,166
Yeah, no problem.
Was he fussy?

259
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,792
No, it was fine.

260
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:17,083
Did he do that thing
where he stretches

261
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,625
and he looks like
a relaxed old man?

262
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:22,083
You know, honestly,
I didn't notice.

263
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:25,041
You did... offer
to watch him, Sam.

264
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,709
Yeah.

265
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,375
Well, you shouldn't have if it
was just gonna piss you off.

266
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:33,000
Sorry for the inconvenience.

267
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,875
You know your parents are just
looking out for you, right?

268
00:09:39,917 --> 00:09:42,625
By following me
everywhere I go?

269
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:44,041
That's what parents
are supposed to do.

270
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,041
All right.
Your ears look good.

271
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,583
Your glands are okay.

272
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,208
Open your mouth
and say "ahh."

273
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,458
Ahh.

274
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,750
You're 10 years old.

275
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:54,709
That means they got, like,
eight more years to hassle you.

276
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,625
All right, no fever,
no swelling, no redness.

277
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:00,917
If I didn't know better,
I would think maybe

278
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,417
somebody wants
to ditch school today.

279
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,709
You got a big test
or something?

280
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,917
Hey.

281
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,041
You've been coming to me
since you were 2 years old.

282
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,041
You know you can
tell me anything.

283
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,542
They won't listen to me,
Dr. Freedman.

284
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,875
I keep telling them,
but they don't believe me.

285
00:10:18,917 --> 00:10:20,959
What don't they believe?

286
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,083
Hey.

287
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,625
I can't help you unless you
tell me what's going on.

288
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:31,333
I'm a boy.

289
00:10:39,917 --> 00:10:41,041
Of course melody's parents
won't listen.

290
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,709
Who wants to hear that?

291
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,041
Look, parenting ain't easy,
all right? That's the job.

292
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:46,166
It's--it's how you handle it
that's the issue.

293
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:48,125
Well, denying melody's feelings
isn't the answer.

294
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,792
I mean, she says she's always
known she was a boy.

295
00:10:49,834 --> 00:10:51,250
Even as a toddler,
she felt like

296
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:52,500
she was trapped
in a girl's body.

297
00:10:52,542 --> 00:10:54,875
She used to line up to--
to go to the boys' bathroom.

298
00:10:54,917 --> 00:10:56,166
She wanted to play
on the boys' sports teams.

299
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,917
Well, isn't that just
being a tomboy?

300
00:10:57,959 --> 00:10:59,500
- Could be g.I.D.
- She's 10.

301
00:10:59,542 --> 00:11:01,417
You can't diagnose gender
identity disorder in a kid.

302
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,959
Her prefrontal cortex
isn't fully developed.

303
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,500
Well, that doesn't mean
she doesn't know how she feels.

304
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:07,542
No, but it might mean she
doesn't really understand it.

305
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,709
Look, when Maya was 8, she said
she wanted to be a fireman.

306
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,333
She grew out of it.

307
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,000
And melody probably will, too.

308
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,000
As soon as she hits puberty,
the hormones will kick in,

309
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,291
she'll start to develop,

310
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,542
and she'll want to be
around boys.

311
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:19,792
She won't want to be one.

312
00:11:19,834 --> 00:11:21,083
Well, it's a little bit
more complicated than that.

313
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,208
Kids with g.I.D. Experience
a disconnect between

314
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,709
their sex, which is anatomy,
and their gender,

315
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,583
which is emotions, behaviors,
and everything else.

316
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,125
And the longer they're forced
to live with the wrong gender,

317
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,667
the more damage is done.

318
00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:31,125
And the sooner they can
integrate their external body

319
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,375
with their internal image
of themselves,

320
00:11:33,417 --> 00:11:34,583
the better they do.

321
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,417
You're talking about melody
dressing up like a boy?

322
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:37,959
For a start.

323
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,959
Well, it's one thing if they
allow her to do that at home,

324
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,583
but once she steps foot
in school,

325
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:42,792
I mean, she's gonna
open herself up to ridicule,

326
00:11:42,834 --> 00:11:44,208
possibly bullying--

327
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,458
okay, so we're saying
she's screwed either way?

328
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,458
I mean,
she lives like a boy

329
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,875
and she risks getting

330
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:49,041
the crap kicked out of her
at school every day,

331
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,667
or she lives like a girl
and has to face

332
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,667
the angst and depression of
being caught in the wrong body?

333
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:54,166
Well, it's--
it's not just depression.

334
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,542
I mean, kids with true g.I.D.
Often hurt themselves.

335
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,041
They cut themselves,
they do drugs,

336
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,667
suicide rate is five times
the national average.

337
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:03,375
Okay, well, that means...
You have to talk to her

338
00:12:03,417 --> 00:12:05,208
and make a diagnosis.

339
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,458
And if it is g.I.D.,

340
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,834
we need to explain it
to the parents.

341
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,291
Well, that's assuming
they'll listen.

342
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,041
Well,

343
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,625
I just can't help thinking

344
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:16,041
that while I am obsessing over
whether or not my nanny

345
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,625
can work longer hours,

346
00:12:17,667 --> 00:12:21,500
this mother is trying
to keep her kid alive.

347
00:12:21,542 --> 00:12:24,375
You have
rich white lady guilt.

348
00:12:24,417 --> 00:12:26,625
Yes. No.

349
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:28,667
I--come on, Violet.
I have a mixed-race baby.

350
00:12:28,709 --> 00:12:31,041
I adopted him from a woman
with limited options.

351
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,458
It's not like I don't get it.
I know.

352
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,041
But it's hard.

353
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,500
You have $10,000 worth of
baby clothes in Henry's closet,

354
00:12:36,542 --> 00:12:39,083
and you have no way to help this
woman who's actually desperate.

355
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,041
Yes.

356
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,667
And you're
not comfortable inducing?

357
00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:44,041
I don't know.

358
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,542
It's not ideal, but I mean,

359
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,542
then neither is bringing
the baby back to El Salvador.

360
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,041
And when did Charlotte say
immigration is coming?

361
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,417
Uh, the next 24 hours.

362
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:51,875
Oh, I'm so sorry.

363
00:12:51,917 --> 00:12:53,709
Yeah.

364
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,417
Well, you can always take
Pete's strategy

365
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,041
and do nothing until
it blows up in your face.

366
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:00,333
What blew up in your face?

367
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:01,542
Nothing. Nothing yet.

368
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,542
No, he just wants to, uh,
do the whole,

369
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,083
you know,
"put down the baggage thing,"

370
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,625
and, uh, I am wary.

371
00:13:06,667 --> 00:13:08,875
Okay, what exactly does that
mean, put down the baggage?

372
00:13:08,917 --> 00:13:11,041
It means he wants to go
to dinner instead of therapy.

373
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,959
Are the two
mutually exclusive?

374
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,917
To him they are.

375
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,458
I--look, I...

376
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,667
I don't feel like
I can say no.

377
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:19,041
I don't even want to say no,

378
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,709
I just--i want us to work,

379
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,041
and I don't think that we can
get there on our own anymore

380
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,250
but...

381
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:28,583
But maybe I can use the dinner
to convince him to...

382
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:31,917
Go back to therapy.

383
00:13:38,792 --> 00:13:40,000
Hey, any chance you could pick
up Mason after school today?

384
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:41,250
Sure.

385
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:42,875
I have this, uh, patient--
melody, 10-year-old girl

386
00:13:42,917 --> 00:13:44,166
who thinks
she's a little boy.

387
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,542
Violet and I are gonna go over
and talk to the parents.

388
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,917
I cannot imagine
dealing with that as a parent.

389
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,583
Yeah, well, I wouldn't know
about that.

390
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:53,041
Oh, come on, Charlotte.
I apologized for saying that.

391
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,750
No, you've been talking to me
like you've apologized.

392
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,417
You've been saying
the things people say

393
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:57,625
after they've apologized.

394
00:13:57,667 --> 00:14:00,250
But the actual apology,
I never heard that.

395
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,041
God, please don't do this.

396
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:03,291
My son
is barely talking to me.

397
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,625
He doesn't listen
to a word I say.

398
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:06,125
He only responds to you.
I'm a little pissed off.

399
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,083
There's only child
in our family, Cooper.

400
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,792
So grow up
and get over it.

401
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,750
I'm worried about Amelia.

402
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,542
She's not seeing me
for prenatal care.

403
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,542
I don't even know if she's
getting any medical attention--

404
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,667
I've got it covered.

405
00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:27,583
Oh, so you're her o.B.?

406
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,250
I've got it covered,
Addison.

407
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:30,792
That's it?

408
00:14:30,834 --> 00:14:32,750
You're not gonna tell me
how she's doing physically,

409
00:14:32,792 --> 00:14:33,709
emotionally--

410
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,333
I am not discussing this
with you.

411
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,000
Okay, look, I respect that.
I do. I do.

412
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,542
I mean, Amelia's made it
very clear

413
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,542
that she doesn't want my help,
but I just--i love her,

414
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,041
and I-I want her to know
that if she needs me--

415
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,583
if you want to tell Amelia
something, tell her yourself.

416
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm not getting
in the middle of it.

417
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:55,709
¿Usted ha visitado
a Santa Ana?

418
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,041
Hace muchos anos.

419
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,083
Hey.

420
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,000
Hey.
How are you feeling?

421
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:04,041
Fine. But I'm running
out of time.

422
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,667
Reina was just telling me about
the village where she's from.

423
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:07,834
I helped set up a clinic
in that area years ago.

424
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:10,667
I know this clinic,
but it's just a building now.

425
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:12,625
When I was little,
the doctors left,

426
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:14,875
and it was hard for us
to get any medicines.

427
00:15:14,917 --> 00:15:16,208
Wait. What?

428
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,041
I spent a year down there.
We made so much progress.

429
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,625
But the crime
and the poverty

430
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:21,083
and the hurricanes--

431
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,625
you could not
do anything about that.

432
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:24,959
No one can.

433
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,667
If I could make a life
for my baby at home,

434
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:28,500
I would not have come here.

435
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:30,041
But I can't.

436
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,417
No, I know, reina,

437
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:34,041
and I can't imagine how hard
this is for you, truly.

438
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,500
But I do need you to understand
the risks your baby would face

439
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:37,709
if you had him now.

440
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,125
I do. I promise you.

441
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:43,250
But I want you
to understand the risk

442
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:45,083
if I don't have him now.

443
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,083
Hey.

444
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,291
You all right?

445
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,041
Ooh. I am trying so hard
not to be angry right now.

446
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,333
Uh-oh. Addison?

447
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,875
Huh. Who else?

448
00:16:04,917 --> 00:16:06,041
What now?

449
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,083
She drops by this morning,

450
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,959
asks me if I can
look after Henry.

451
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,041
Really?

452
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,375
Yeah, man.

453
00:16:11,417 --> 00:16:13,583
I mean, she didn't
"ask me" ask me,

454
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,041
but, you know,
the nanny was late,

455
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,583
she couldn't find
anybody else to cover.

456
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,750
What am I supposed
to say, no?

457
00:16:18,792 --> 00:16:20,709
It's just like
when you were together.

458
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,041
Y--

459
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,583
that's not funny, man.

460
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,750
I mean, I shouldn't even
be an option, right?

461
00:16:25,792 --> 00:16:27,041
I'm the ex.

462
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,083
That Henry is
a cute little baby, though.

463
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:32,542
And we circle back.

464
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:35,333
You know what? You're right.

465
00:16:36,542 --> 00:16:37,709
She wanted that baby.

466
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,041
She should handle him
on her own.

467
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,208
Hey... stop trying
to be the bad guy.

468
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,583
It's not really you.

469
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,125
Hey.

470
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:54,375
Hey.

471
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:57,083
Reina really put us
on the spot earlier, huh?

472
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,291
Yeah, well, I get it.

473
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,375
You know, she's a mother
advocating for her child.

474
00:17:00,417 --> 00:17:02,166
Oh, it's so frustrating.

475
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,625
You know, we opened a clinic
near where reina lived

476
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:05,208
in Santa Ana.

477
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,583
We staffed it,
we trained people,

478
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,166
and in a region that's
that deprived,

479
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,417
even the slightest changes
make a huge difference.

480
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,417
You know, a little access
to preventative care

481
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,166
and medicine, it's...
I know.

482
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:17,041
I left there thinking that
the problem was solved.

483
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,375
Is there any chance that
reina would want to stay here,

484
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:21,583
fight the deportation,
try to make a life?

485
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,041
I asked her that.
She said she tried.

486
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,375
She traveled all the way
up through Mexico,

487
00:17:24,417 --> 00:17:25,667
she snuck across the border,

488
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:26,959
immediately applied
for asylum,

489
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,208
but she lost her hearing
and her appeal.

490
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,667
So she's out of options.

491
00:17:29,709 --> 00:17:31,250
What if we sponsor her,

492
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,542
and do whatever it takes,
get her a job?

493
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,417
That's not really the way
the process works.

494
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,500
I just... I don't know.

495
00:17:37,542 --> 00:17:39,625
If I induce her, then i'm
gonna feel responsible for

496
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:41,625
a woman leaving her baby.

497
00:17:41,667 --> 00:17:43,500
This is not on you,
Addison.

498
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:51,834
Physically,
melody is fine.

499
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,041
She has no infections.

500
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:54,083
Her blood work came back
totally normal.

501
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:56,583
But emotionally,
I am a little concerned,

502
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:59,041
which is why I asked Dr. Turner
to join us.

503
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,291
We may have noticed
some things about your daughter

504
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,500
that might be
a little concerning

505
00:18:02,542 --> 00:18:03,792
or hard to understand--

506
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:05,291
what are you talking about?

507
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,917
We understand her just fine.

508
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:12,041
Well, melody feels like
she's a boy

509
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,750
trapped in a girl's body.

510
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:15,041
Not that again.

511
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,834
No, melody's
always loved make-believe.

512
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,917
From the time she was little,
she would always do these plays

513
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:20,291
where she was the cowboy,
the cowgirl, the horse.

514
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,291
She'd dress up,
do different voices.

515
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,500
I'm not sure
if this is make-believe.

516
00:18:24,542 --> 00:18:27,250
Sh-she may have something
called g.I.D.--

517
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,083
gender identity disorder.

518
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:32,125
Or she's just confused,
going through a stage.

519
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,041
Maybe. Maybe.

520
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:36,041
I-I won't really know until I
have a chance to speak with her

521
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,041
and to do that,
I need your permission.

522
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:41,500
Well, if she does have
this g.I.D...

523
00:18:41,542 --> 00:18:44,208
Is there anything
you can do to cure it?

524
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,709
Well, that wouldn't really
be our approach to this.

525
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,542
Therapy would be more about
helping melody adjust

526
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:51,750
to her new reality.

527
00:18:51,792 --> 00:18:53,291
And in addition to therapy,

528
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,041
there are hormone-blocking drugs
that could

529
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,917
stave off puberty for her

530
00:18:56,959 --> 00:18:58,917
so that she would have some time
to deal with these issues.

531
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:00,250
Well, Dr. Freedman, that--

532
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,125
This is a joke, right?

533
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,375
You want us to stop
our daughter from growing up

534
00:19:04,417 --> 00:19:06,166

some ridiculous story

What?

624
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:39,583
Last night we went out
and just...

625
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:43,458
Look, there's a time to talk
and there's a time to...

626
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,750
Not talk.

and I hope that you get
everything out of this

632
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:55,792
that you want,
but in my experience,

633
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:57,792
you know, you can use sex
to get back,

634
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:00,041
but once you're there, you end
up having the same problems

635
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:01,458

the first time.

636
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,041

you two are big boys,

641
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:10,041
you can make
your own decisions, but me,

642
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:13,208
I never go back
to the same well twice.

643
00:23:25,917 --> 00:23:28,375

to the hospital for her?

644
00:23:28,417 --> 00:23:30,583

and want to take her right now.

645
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:32,083
Said they have
their own medical facility

646
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:33,375
and can handle everything.

647
00:23:33,417 --> 00:23:34,583
Charlotte--

648
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:36,041
I am repeating not agreeing.

649
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,375
Addison, you know the official
position of this hospital

650
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:40,875
is that you can't induce
a woman early

651
00:23:40,917 --> 00:23:42,041
without medical indication.

652
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:43,458
I know. I know.
What's your position?

653
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,041
I think that no matter
what our lawyers,

654
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:48,041
or those agents,
or anyone else says,

655
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:49,333
you are her doctor.

656
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:58,041
Reina, I'm going to break
your water.

657
00:23:58,083 --> 00:24:00,583
And then I'm gonna put you
on an oxytocin I.V.

658
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:01,917
That will start your labor.

659
00:24:01,959 --> 00:24:03,959
It may take a couple of hours,

660
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,250

your son will be born.

663
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:22,458
He kicked.

664
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,333
My baby, he, um, he kicked
like any other baby,

665
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:26,000
like a normal baby.

666
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:28,792
Uh, maybe--maybe we should
do some more tests

667
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:30,375

I just--i haven't...

679
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:10,709
Stopped to think about
what it would be like...

680
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:14,834
What it would feel like when he
started moving inside me.

681
00:25:25,667 --> 00:25:27,583
Do you feel that?

682
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,041
Yes.

683
00:25:31,083 --> 00:25:32,458
I do.

684
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:37,792

685

686
00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:46,417
She took the bus.

687
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:47,375
And her parents?

688
00:25:47,417 --> 00:25:48,625
They think she's at school.

689
00:25:48,667 --> 00:25:49,875
We need to call them.

690
00:25:49,917 --> 00:25:51,208
I know.

691
00:25:53,083 --> 00:25:54,125

before we called 'em?

692

Cooper.

693
00:25:55,458 --> 00:25:56,625

694
00:25:56,667 --> 00:25:58,208
make a real diagnosis.

695
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,500

698
00:26:01,834 --> 00:26:03,041
They won't believe us
or her.

699
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:06,041
Well, talking to melody
behind their backs

700
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:07,917
is only gonna address
half the problem,

701
00:26:07,959 --> 00:26:09,375
and it might make things more
difficult for melody at home.

702
00:26:09,417 --> 00:26:11,709
Well, it's better
than nothing.

703
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,291
Melody is not Mason.

704
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:15,000
What is that
supposed to mean?

705
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:16,583
I think you are frustrated
that you can't help Mason

706
00:26:16,625 --> 00:26:18,041
with his grieving,

707
00:26:18,083 --> 00:26:19,667
and so you're pushing too hard
to save melody.

708
00:26:19,709 --> 00:26:21,625
Come on.
Hormone-blocking drugs?

709
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:23,417
It's a real option.
It's way down the line,
Cooper,

710
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:25,375
and it's not
the first thing you say

711
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,208
to two terrified parents
who are afraid to admit

712
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,458
that their daughter--

713
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,667
okay, I get that, Violet,
but these people

714
00:26:29,709 --> 00:26:31,375
have turned their backs
on their daughter,

715
00:26:31,417 --> 00:26:33,458
and the more they ignore
how she feels,

716
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,417
the more
she's gonna withdraw.

717
00:26:36,458 --> 00:26:38,291
We need to do something.

718
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:47,667
My mom and dad were fighting
about me last night.

719
00:26:47,709 --> 00:26:50,291
He said he wanted to know about
the pills that could help me.

720
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:52,458
But she wouldn't listen.

721
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,875
Then she started yelling.

722
00:26:56,542 --> 00:26:59,667
So if I take the pills,

723
00:26:59,709 --> 00:27:01,375
will I become a boy?

724
00:27:01,417 --> 00:27:03,041
Well, it's not
that simple, Mel.

725
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:05,500
The drugs won't turn you
into anything.

726
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:08,291
But they will stop you
from maturing into a woman

727
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:11,291
until you decide
who you are.

728
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:12,500
I know who I am.

729
00:27:12,542 --> 00:27:14,458
I-I know you think you do,

730
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,875
but sometimes,
things can be confusing.

731
00:27:16,917 --> 00:27:18,959
I'm not confused.

732
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,542
During the day,
I have to be a girl.

733
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,458
But at night,

734
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,750
when I close my eyes
and I dream...

735
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,792
I'm a boy...

736
00:27:31,834 --> 00:27:33,667
Doing boy things.

737
00:27:33,709 --> 00:27:35,709
And then when I wake up,

738
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:40,041
for a second, I'm still a boy.

739
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:41,792
But then my mom comes in

740
00:27:41,834 --> 00:27:44,166
and lays out clothes
for the day.

741
00:27:44,208 --> 00:27:47,125
It's usually a dress
or glittery shoes.

742
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:50,166
It's always the same.

743
00:27:50,208 --> 00:27:52,375
I refuse to wear it,

744
00:27:52,417 --> 00:27:54,291
she gets mad,

745
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:57,291
and we fight,
and I lose TV.

746
00:27:57,333 --> 00:28:02,041
She doesn't understand
how it makes me feel.

747
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:04,333
How does it make you feel?

748
00:28:04,375 --> 00:28:06,417
Wearing girl clothes,

749
00:28:06,458 --> 00:28:08,917
acting like a girl
at school...

750
00:28:10,667 --> 00:28:12,375
I hate it.

751
00:28:12,417 --> 00:28:14,250
It's like...

752
00:28:14,291 --> 00:28:18,458
I'm pretending all the time

753
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,041
and I can't stop.

754
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:22,834
No one will let me.

755
00:28:27,458 --> 00:28:29,583
It's okay to cry,
melody.

756
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:32,542
Even boys cry sometimes.

757
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:40,041
I'm sorry.
Are we interrupting?

758
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:41,834
Uh, could you just
give us a second?

759
00:28:41,875 --> 00:28:44,792
What's wrong with you?

760
00:28:44,834 --> 00:28:47,041
Nothing.
What's wrong with you?

761
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:49,208
My mom died.

762
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:52,333
I'm a boy
and nobody believes me.

763
00:28:54,875 --> 00:28:56,417
You want to come play?

764
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,291
Hey.
Do you have a second?

765
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:15,834
I have a delivery.
Can it wait?

766
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:17,083
Oh, yeah, yeah.
It's nothing really.

767
00:29:17,125 --> 00:29:18,834
I just... yeah, it's--
it's nothing.

768
00:29:18,875 --> 00:29:20,333
All right. Out with it.

769
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:23,041
Uh, I think Pete and I,
we did a bad thing.

770
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:24,500
A bad thing like?

771
00:29:24,542 --> 00:29:25,458
We had sex.

772
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,041
Ooh,
that's an interesting way

773
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:29,041
of convincing him
to go back to therapy.

774
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:31,125
No, I know, but, you know,
maybe it's a start.

775
00:29:31,166 --> 00:29:32,417
A start toward?

776
00:29:32,458 --> 00:29:33,709
Trying to fix things
Pete's way.

777
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,917
Acting from what I feel
instead of what I think.

778
00:29:35,959 --> 00:29:37,041
Can you do that?

779
00:29:37,083 --> 00:29:38,208
I can try.

780
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,417
Should you do that?

781
00:29:39,458 --> 00:29:41,041
Maybe not.

782
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:42,834
I did say it was a bad thing,
didn't I?

783
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:44,041
Oh.

784
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:45,333
It's so much easier
telling other people

785
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:47,333
what to do
with their lives.

786
00:29:47,375 --> 00:29:49,041
She's dilated,
plus-2 station.

787
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:51,041
I just need a big push.

788
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:52,417
I'm trying.

789
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:54,291
You're doing great.
Just bear down.

790
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:55,542
Come on.

791
00:29:55,583 --> 00:29:56,500
Okay, I've got the head.
Almost there.

792
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,083
Is he here?

793
00:30:00,125 --> 00:30:02,083
He's here.

794
00:30:03,542 --> 00:30:06,375
Is he okay?
Is everything okay?

795
00:30:06,417 --> 00:30:08,250
He's fine.

796
00:30:08,291 --> 00:30:10,041
He's a healthy,
beautiful boy.

797
00:30:11,291 --> 00:30:12,500
He's amazing.

798
00:30:16,792 --> 00:30:19,041
You want to hold him?

799
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:23,000
For as long as I can.

800
00:30:24,291 --> 00:30:28,041
Te quiero, cielito.

801
00:30:31,959 --> 00:30:33,417
Everything okay?

802
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:35,291
Great.

803
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,041
The immigration guy
is still hanging around?

804
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:42,458
You don't feel like she's ready
to be moved yet, do you?

805
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:47,917
Not today.

806
00:30:47,959 --> 00:30:49,500
I'll let him know.

807
00:30:51,208 --> 00:30:53,000
Thank you.

808
00:30:53,041 --> 00:30:54,542
I'm gonna give you two
some time.

809
00:30:54,583 --> 00:30:56,959
Thank you so much,
Dr. Montgomery.

810
00:31:04,709 --> 00:31:06,458
Reina, are you sure
you want to leave him here?

811
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,750
I mean--

812
00:31:07,792 --> 00:31:09,041
at home, I have no one.

813
00:31:09,083 --> 00:31:11,166
My parents are dead,

814
00:31:11,208 --> 00:31:13,542
and my brother, he left home
a long time ago.

815
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:15,750
And the baby's father is...

816
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:18,792
He disappeared.

817
00:31:18,834 --> 00:31:21,375
If I could go back...

818
00:31:21,417 --> 00:31:23,750
I love my baby, but...

819
00:31:23,792 --> 00:31:26,333
I would do my life
differently.

820
00:31:26,375 --> 00:31:28,417
But that is not possible,

821
00:31:28,458 --> 00:31:32,041
so... for me,
no looking back.

822
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:49,834
Hey.

823
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:52,250
Yes!

824
00:31:52,291 --> 00:31:54,917
Does melody know
you called her parents?

825
00:31:54,959 --> 00:31:56,834
I couldn't bring myself
to tell her.

826
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:58,083
Cooper.

827
00:31:58,125 --> 00:31:59,291
I didn't want to risk
her running away again.

828
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:01,542
No! So close.

829
00:32:01,583 --> 00:32:03,375
Okay, showtime.

830
00:32:03,417 --> 00:32:05,250
A second chance.
Fine.

831
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:06,709
We're here
to see Dr. Freedman.

832
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,041
Hi.

833
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:09,542
Where is she?

834
00:32:09,583 --> 00:32:10,500
She's, uh, playing.

835
00:32:10,542 --> 00:32:11,750
She's okay?

836
00:32:11,792 --> 00:32:13,291
She's fine. She's fine.

837
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:15,041
Good, because she and I
are gonna have a little talk.

838
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:17,500
Y-You know, you cannot
berate your daughter into

839
00:32:17,542 --> 00:32:19,041
changing her mind.

840
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:20,333
The only thing you can do
is support her

841
00:32:20,375 --> 00:32:22,333
and help her navigate
these feelings.

842
00:32:22,375 --> 00:32:23,875
She's just a child.

843
00:32:23,917 --> 00:32:25,125
Who feels that she's
trapped in the wrong body.

844
00:32:25,166 --> 00:32:26,625
And I know that sounds
crazy to you,

845
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:28,333
but I have spoken to her,

846
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:30,625
and she--well, she came
to us for help, and i--

847
00:32:30,667 --> 00:32:32,458
and I couldn't
not talk to her.

848
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,208
I just--i just couldn't.
But the important thing is,

849
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:36,709
now I believe that--
that she's not confused

850
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,083
and that
she's not imagining this.

851
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:40,041
Well, what are we
supposed to do?

852
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,250
Don't encourage them
Michael.

853
00:32:41,291 --> 00:32:42,959
Well, what if they're right?

854
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,250
We need to help her.

855
00:32:44,291 --> 00:32:45,542
I don't have to listen
to this anymore.

856
00:32:45,583 --> 00:32:47,041
Where is she?

857
00:32:47,083 --> 00:32:49,959
She's in here.

858
00:32:53,041 --> 00:32:55,291
Mel.

859
00:32:55,333 --> 00:32:57,333
Melody,
we're going home.

860
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,542
But I-I-I don't want to.

861
00:32:59,583 --> 00:33:01,166
I don't care
what you want.

862
00:33:01,208 --> 00:33:02,125
Don't yell at her.

863
00:33:02,166 --> 00:33:03,542
Uh, mase.

864
00:33:03,583 --> 00:33:04,792
Who is this?

865
00:33:04,834 --> 00:33:06,959
- Th-this is my son.
- And he's right.

866
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,834
Nothing's gonna be solved
by yelling.

867
00:33:11,208 --> 00:33:12,458
Dad, do something.

868
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,709
Come on!

869
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,000
Pam, Pam, Pam.

870
00:33:15,041 --> 00:33:16,500
Ow!

871
00:33:16,542 --> 00:33:18,041
I understand that you're angry
and frustrated and scared.

872
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:20,083
Melody is not happy, and you
don't know how to help her.

873
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:21,792
But we do.
We can help, okay?

874
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:23,041
We don't have to listen
to you.

875
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:24,083
No, you have to listen
to melody.

876
00:33:24,125 --> 00:33:25,750
Your job is to protect her

877
00:33:25,792 --> 00:33:28,583
and love her and help her,
no matter what.

878
00:33:28,625 --> 00:33:30,500
But first...

879
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:32,333
You have to try
to understand her.

880
00:33:32,375 --> 00:33:35,041
Don't you tell me
how to raise my daughter.

881
00:33:35,083 --> 00:33:36,041
You're hurting me!

882
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:37,291
Pam.

883
00:33:41,125 --> 00:33:43,583
This is my little girl.

884
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:46,000
Do you hear me?
She's my little girl!

885
00:33:48,375 --> 00:33:50,583
Don't cry, mommy.

886
00:33:55,458 --> 00:33:57,458
You don't
have to do this alone.

887
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,875
We can help you two understand
what's going on with melody

888
00:34:00,917 --> 00:34:03,458
and--and help her transition
to be the person

889
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,834
that she is inside.

890
00:34:08,166 --> 00:34:09,792
She's right.

891
00:34:11,375 --> 00:34:12,875
She's right.

892
00:34:19,083 --> 00:34:22,208
Violet, oh, I have
an amazing idea.

893
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:23,709
A-Act-actually, i--

894
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:27,083
no, no, no. Remember that place
in carmel that you love

895
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:28,250
with the cabins?

896
00:34:28,291 --> 00:34:30,375
Let's drive up there
with Lucas this weekend.

897
00:34:30,417 --> 00:34:32,208
Just the three of us.
We would love it--

898
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,417
Pete, no, no, Pete, Pete--
we could spend
some time together--

899
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:36,291
no, we're--
we're not gonna do that.

900
00:34:36,333 --> 00:34:39,375
I mean, what we've been
trying to do here,

901
00:34:39,417 --> 00:34:41,417
this whole
"put down the baggage

902
00:34:41,458 --> 00:34:43,625
and have fun and be us again,"
it's--

903
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:45,500
it's--it's seductive

904
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:48,250
and I can't say
I haven't...

905
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:49,458
I haven't loved it.

906
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,917
But going forward,
it's not gonna be enough.

907
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:55,291
You know, having sex
and talking about starting over,

908
00:34:55,333 --> 00:34:57,333
it's just not gonna be--
it's not gonna fix

909
00:34:57,375 --> 00:35:00,166
whatever's fundamentally
wrong with our relationship.

910
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:01,625
Violet, why do we have to
keep looking back?

911
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:03,542
Can't we just deal with
the now?

912
00:35:03,583 --> 00:35:06,417
Because we don't even know
what happened... Pete.

913
00:35:06,458 --> 00:35:09,417
We--we have to go back
and figure that out.

914
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:11,333
And we had just started
to scratch the surface

915
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:14,250
and...

916
00:35:14,291 --> 00:35:16,333
You need to do the work.

917
00:35:16,375 --> 00:35:18,875
We...

918
00:35:18,917 --> 00:35:22,667
We need to do the work.

919
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:30,083
I thought you understood.

920
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:31,542
I do. I do understand.

921
00:35:31,583 --> 00:35:34,250
And if you were to tell me that
you wanted to leave your baby

922
00:35:34,291 --> 00:35:35,709
because you weren't emotionally
prepared to raise him,

923
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,166
I would be the first one

924
00:35:37,208 --> 00:35:38,375
saying that you're doing
the right thing,

925
00:35:38,417 --> 00:35:40,041
but you do want to raise him.

926
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:42,000
And even though I admire

927
00:35:42,041 --> 00:35:44,041
your willingness
to sacrifice so that

928
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:45,250
he has a better chance
at life than you had,

929
00:35:45,291 --> 00:35:48,041
I just--i feel like
there has to be

930
00:35:48,083 --> 00:35:49,166
a better way.

931
00:35:49,208 --> 00:35:50,375
There is no other way.

932
00:35:50,417 --> 00:35:52,750
What--what if you
went back temporarily,

933
00:35:52,792 --> 00:35:54,041
and then you reapplied for--

934
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:56,333
it would take years
if it ever happened.

935
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:57,542
What if I went with you?

936
00:35:57,583 --> 00:35:59,125
What? Pete.

937
00:35:59,166 --> 00:36:02,375
I--I've spent time there.
I know my way around.

938
00:36:02,417 --> 00:36:05,417
I could help you and the baby
get settled, make a life.

939
00:36:05,458 --> 00:36:06,792
It would...

940
00:36:06,834 --> 00:36:08,375
How could you do that?

941
00:36:08,417 --> 00:36:10,375
You have a family

942
00:36:10,417 --> 00:36:12,041
and your life is here.

943
00:36:13,792 --> 00:36:15,041
Well, there's no other way,
is there?

944
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:39,417
Hi.
Hey.

945
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:41,041
What's going on?

946
00:36:41,083 --> 00:36:45,041
Um, i'm...

947
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:47,166
I'm gonna leave
for a while.

948
00:36:47,208 --> 00:36:49,375
What?

949
00:36:49,417 --> 00:36:51,208
Wh-where are you going?

950
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,792
El Salvador. There's a clinic
there I used to work--

951
00:36:53,834 --> 00:36:55,250
what the hell
are you talking about?

952
00:36:55,291 --> 00:36:58,041
I want to fix it.
I-I feel like--

953
00:36:58,083 --> 00:37:00,875
you should feel like you have
something to fix right here--

954
00:37:00,917 --> 00:37:03,667
us, our marriage.

955
00:37:03,709 --> 00:37:06,041
I'm standing
right in front of you, Pete.

956
00:37:06,083 --> 00:37:08,166
Your son is sleeping
right upstairs.

957
00:37:08,208 --> 00:37:11,083
You can't just run away.

958
00:37:11,125 --> 00:37:14,041
Please.

959
00:37:14,083 --> 00:37:16,333
Please do not do this.

960
00:37:22,083 --> 00:37:23,709
Hey, hey, Amelia.

961
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,875
Look, I know you hate me,

962
00:37:25,917 --> 00:37:27,875
but... this isn't the end
of the road for us.

963
00:37:27,917 --> 00:37:30,000
We're family and we always
will be. I just...

964
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:32,417
I just need you to know,
I think...

965
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,041
You're amazing.

966
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:35,417
You're stronger
than I could ever be.

967
00:37:35,458 --> 00:37:38,458
I don't know how
you're getting through this.

968
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,041
And I'm here for you
for whatever you need,

969
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:44,208
even if what you need
is someone to hate.

970
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:46,000
Dr. Montgomery,
we need you right away.

971
00:37:53,166 --> 00:37:54,709
What happened?

972
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:56,542
I came in to take reina
and the baby back to the room,

973
00:37:56,583 --> 00:37:57,834
but they were gone.

974
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,750
We searched the whole ward,
but...

975
00:37:59,792 --> 00:38:01,375
If she cut off the tags
or tried to take him out,

976
00:38:01,417 --> 00:38:02,834
the alarms would've sounded,
and there's nothing.

977
00:38:02,875 --> 00:38:05,542
Well, she's not stealing.
It's her baby.

978
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:08,542
But she shouldn't be
leaving yet, should she?

979
00:38:08,583 --> 00:38:10,083
She's the mother.

980
00:38:10,125 --> 00:38:12,291
It's her choice.

981
00:38:21,083 --> 00:38:22,750
Doctor, quint's map.

982
00:38:22,792 --> 00:38:24,125
How did you
come by it, lad?

983
00:38:24,166 --> 00:38:26,750
Why he gave it to me, sir,
when he sent me for help.

984
00:38:26,792 --> 00:38:28,083
He said that we'd share.

985
00:38:28,125 --> 00:38:30,125
Share what?

986
00:38:30,166 --> 00:38:32,458
You don't know?
Pirate treasure, man.

987
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,917
It's gold.

988
00:38:36,917 --> 00:38:38,250
Hey, fellas.

989
00:38:38,291 --> 00:38:39,166
Hey.
Hi.

990
00:38:41,291 --> 00:38:42,542
You want to join us?

991
00:38:42,583 --> 00:38:45,083
It's okay.
You two look comfortable.

992
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:46,667
Come on. Come watch.

993
00:38:48,208 --> 00:38:50,083
Well, all right then.

994
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:54,208
Master Roland,
you're a trump, young Hawkins.

995
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:56,834
Mark my words,
you will share.

996
00:39:01,458 --> 00:39:04,500
I really am sorry.

997
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:06,208
I know.

998
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:15,750
Hey, guys.
Sorry I'm a little late.

999
00:39:15,792 --> 00:39:19,166
Hope I didn't miss bath time.
