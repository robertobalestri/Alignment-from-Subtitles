00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:03,000

111
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,041

115
00:04:04,834 --> 00:04:06,458
And I tried to give him o-2,
but it didn't work,

116
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,667
and then he was gagging--

117
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:09,041
okay, okay, slow down.
Slow down, Roger.

118
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,583
I knew his cardiomyopathy

119

This can't be it.

120
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,250

121
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:15,834
Troy.
Hang in there, Troy.

122
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,500
How's his oxygenation?

123
00:04:17,542 --> 00:04:19,041
What's happening?
You gotta get outta here,
Roger.

124

125
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,041
Pressure's at 72 palp.
Troy? Nonresponsive.
Time to intubate him.

126
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,041
What? Why?
Because he's not
responding to meds.

127
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:27,041
We gotta get him on a ventilator
to help him breathe.

128
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,458
No, no, no, no.
No machines.

129
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,667
Troy and I
talked about this.

130
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:32,083
He does not want
to suffer anymore.

131
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:35,917
Troy... you are
everything to me.

132
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,959
I want you to stay with me,
but if you have to go,

133
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,041
I love you, baby.

134
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,083

I'm sorry. Who are you?

138
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,667
Troy's father.
What--what's wrong with him?

139
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:48,750
Troy is in end-stage
congestive heart failure.

140
00:04:48,792 --> 00:04:50,041
I'm afraid he doesn't have

141
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,709
Look, I know
this is overwhelming.

142
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,041
If there's something
we can do to help you--
there is.

143
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:57,166
Tell that man to stay
the hell away from my son.

144
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,333
You have no right--
he's my son.

145
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,959
You haven't seen him
in five years!
That's your fault!
You started--

146
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,458
That's enough.
Hey, easy, easy.

147
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,125
Yelling will not help Troy.

148
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,542
Now let's just
discuss this calmly.

149
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:18,083
I know this is an emotional time
for your family, but--

150
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,709
we're not a family.
I'm his partner.

151
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,375
Roger's his roommate.
Nothing more.

152
00:05:21,417 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm sorry, sir. How can you
say that when they've been--

153
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,500
okay, with--with all
due respect, Mr. Davis,

154
00:05:24,542 --> 00:05:26,792
I've watched your son struggle
with this disease

155
00:05:26,834 --> 00:05:28,041
for about three years,

156
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,917
and Roger has been by his side
the entire way.

157
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,375
I want you to do
everything you can

158
00:05:31,417 --> 00:05:33,041
to keep my son alive.

159
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,208
If that means putting him
on a ventilator, do it.

160
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,500
No, that is not
what Troy wants.

161
00:05:35,542 --> 00:05:36,917
I don't care!

162
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:38,208
This man has no legal right
to be here

163
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,709
or anywhere near my son.

164
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,500
Does Troy have
an advanced directive

165
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:43,417
or a living will
naming you as his proxy?

166
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,291
We kept meaning to, but we
thought we had more time.

167
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,709
I want him gone.

168
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,291
It might be better for Troy

169
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,083
if Roger were to stay--
no.

170
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,458
I'm sorry,
but you have to leave.

171
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,750
Oh, come on, Charlotte.

172
00:05:55,792 --> 00:05:56,959
They can't do this,
right?

173
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,125
Come on.
We'll get this sorted out.

174
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:00,041
All right? I promise.
We'll figure this out.

175
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,417
I don't know
when it started.

176
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:06,834
Things were just different.

177
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:09,041
Could you
be more specific?

178
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:13,208
Suddenly, he wanted sex
all the time.

179
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,834
Well, it's not uncommon

180
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,875
for people to have fluctuations
in their sex drive.

181
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:19,041
This wasn't
a fluctuation, Dr. Wallace.

182
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,000
I couldn't--i can't
control myself.

183
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:23,250
It was very uncomfortable
for me.

184
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:25,125
And I worry about my daughter.

185
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:26,959
He used...

186
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,041
To be different.

187
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,375
He was my favorite person
to do stuff with.

188
00:06:31,417 --> 00:06:35,041
He wasn't so...

189
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:37,041
It's okay.

190
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:41,166
He looks at me weird.

191
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:44,041
And he comes in
when I ask him not to.

192
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:46,041
Comes in where?

193
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:48,834
Into the bathroom...

194
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,834
When I'm showering.

195
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,667
I'm sorry.

196
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:56,375
I don't want to lie.

197
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:59,041
I have sexual feelings
about my daughter.

198
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,083
And I'm afraid

199
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:03,709
I can't control them.

200
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,542
Has he ever touched you,
Whitney?

201
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,709
No.

202
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:11,208
But now...

203
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,834
I'm scared.

204
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:15,917
The things you try
to do to me,

205
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:19,625
you want to do to... her?

206
00:07:19,667 --> 00:07:21,083
No.

207
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,959
I want you out of the house.

208
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,041
Lori, please.

209
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,125
Please what?
He's a monster.

210
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,417
Rich?

211
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:27,959
Are you okay?
Get the nurse.

212
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,041
Hurry.

213
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,041
Roger should be making
these decisions,

214
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,250
not Troy's estranged father.

215
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:34,500
They're in
a committed relationship.

216
00:07:34,542 --> 00:07:36,041
I'm not disagreeing,

217
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:38,041
but until the law changes,
he's not technically family.

218
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:41,000
So we're just gonna let
that bigot call the shots?

219
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:42,875
Look, it's taking every ounce
of restraint for me

220
00:07:42,917 --> 00:07:44,792
not to punch Troy's father
in the face.

221
00:07:44,834 --> 00:07:46,917
I've seen Roger and Troy
together, and they're a family.

222
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,041
But if something were
to happen to Maya,

223
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,792
as her father,
I would want to be heard.

224
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:51,000
Yeah, but you would also
want to honor her wishes.

225
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:52,375
Troy told Roger

226
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:54,375
that he never wanted to be
hooked up to a ventilator.

227
00:07:54,417 --> 00:07:56,125
Look, I spoke to
the hospital lawyers.

228
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,792
It doesn't matter how we feel
about it. The law is clear.

229
00:07:58,834 --> 00:08:00,583
Without a living will
or directive,

230
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,500
Troy's medical decisions
are made by next of kin,

231
00:08:02,542 --> 00:08:03,917
that is his father.

232
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:06,041
You need to get Troy
on a ventilator right now.

233
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,291
All right. All right.

234
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,125
Hey.

235
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,041
I wanted to come by sooner,

236
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,834
but I had a patient,
and, uh,

237
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,500
I just, uh...

238
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:21,959
I'm so sorry.

239
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,041
Don't say you're sorry.

240
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,709
I'm sick of everyone
saying they're sorry.

241
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,083
Anything else?

242
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,500
My patient, he--

243
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:32,000
he seized during the session--

244
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,000
leave the file.

245
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:41,166
I called you.

246
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,959
I was halfway
across the world--

247
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,542
so you didn't get
my message?
I got it.

248
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,875
I didn't realize how, uh...

249
00:08:51,917 --> 00:08:53,834
I didn't know
what you were going through.

250
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,208
I'm--I'm sorry.

251
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,583
There's that word again.
Amelia--

252
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:58,792
it's weird, right?

253
00:08:58,834 --> 00:09:00,792
That same word can apply
to so many things.

254
00:09:00,834 --> 00:09:03,041
Sorry I was late.
Sorry I didn't call you.

255
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,000
Sorry your baby
doesn't have a brain.

256
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:08,834
I was going through something,
and i--

257
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:11,208
go away. I'm busy
growing a brainless baby.

258
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,041
You know, i'm--it takes
most of the energy

259
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:17,500
I would otherwise waste
talking to people like you.

260
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:28,583
If Whitney is frightened
in her own home,

261
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,000
that's reason enough
to suspect abuse,

262
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,709
and we have to report rich
to d.C.F.S.

263
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,500
You didn't see
how torn up he was.
Uh, no, that's because

264
00:09:33,542 --> 00:09:34,917
I was
talking down a 12 year old

265
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,083
whose father
had violated her privacy.

266
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:38,041
The e.E.G. Showed a lesion
on his temporal lobe,

267
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,041
which is causing
subclinical seizures,

268
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,667
which manifest
as hypersexuality

269
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:43,500
and an inability
to control his impulses.

270
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:45,041
You're making excuses
for a pedophile?

271
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,792
He's not a pedophile. Rich never
laid a hand on Whitney.

272
00:09:47,834 --> 00:09:49,208
And there's been
no prior history

273
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,625
of this kind of behavior.

274
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:52,041
But now, right now,

275
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,417
rich admits to having
sexual feelings for Whitney.

276
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:54,709
Okay, a guy like that,

277
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,083
he doesn't get to be her dad,
Sheldon.

278
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,041
Sudden behavioral changes,
scarring on the temporal lobe,

279
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,041
this is a textbook case
of kluver-bucy syndrome.

280
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,291
You gonna report him?

281
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,542
We'd be accusing him
of child molestation

282
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:03,875
and potentially ruining
his life.

283
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:05,250
What about Whitney's life?

284
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:06,667
What, are we supposed to
just wait

285
00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:08,041
until rich takes the next step?

286
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,083
He won't
because I can fix him

287
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,125
by removing the lesion.

288
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,208
Can you guarantee that?

289
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,041
Okay, even if she could
stop his sexual urges,

290
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,750
how's this guy expect to ever
win back his daughter's trust?

291
00:10:16,792 --> 00:10:17,959
Is accusing him
of being a sex offender

292
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,041
a better way to rebuild
that trust?

293
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,333
All right, forget all that.

294
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,041
Whitney's safety has to be
the top priority.

295
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,125
Then let me help
this family.

296
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,250
I can do it.

297
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,458
Sarah called
and left a message

298
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,917
asking if you were okay.

299
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:29,500
She also reminded me

300
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:31,500
that "all my sons"
is coming to town next week

301
00:10:31,542 --> 00:10:33,542
and that we should buy tickets.

302
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:36,041
One day you--
Roger.

303
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:38,875
You know you're not supposed
to be here, right?

304
00:10:38,917 --> 00:10:40,250
Troy's dad went home.

305
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:43,583
And I snuck past
the nurses' station, so...

306
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,333
Are you gonna turn me in?

307
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,250
No.

308
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,792
Troy would hate this.

309
00:10:50,834 --> 00:10:52,917
All this fighting?

310
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,792
We met at a fight.

311
00:10:54,834 --> 00:10:57,041
Well, it was supposed
to be a wedding,

312
00:10:57,083 --> 00:11:00,166
but two of the girls from
the bridal party got into it.

313
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:03,291
I mean, hip checks, elbows--
I thought it was funny.

314
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,917
But Troy--

315
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,500
mortified.

316
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:08,750
He...

317
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:10,583
He blushed.

318
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:13,333
And I fell for him,
right there.

319
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,709
Is there any way
you can talk to Carl

320
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,083
to change his mind?

321
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,709
Troy's mom died
when he was really young,

322
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,709
and so he was really close
with his dad,

323
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,625
but he was afraid
to come out to him

324
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:26,417
until we got together,

325
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:29,542
and then he just didn't
want to hide me, so...

326
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,041
And his dad can't accept it.

327
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:33,625
He cut him off.
Still, Troy kept trying.

328
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:36,750
He wanted his dad
to understand that he was

329
00:11:36,792 --> 00:11:40,041
the same boy, the same man
that he once loved.

330
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:42,458
I mean, I called Carl
because I know

331
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,625
that Troy still loves his dad.

332
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:46,834
And Carl, I mean, he...

333
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:49,166
He has to love Troy, too,
right?

334
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,625
Maybe that's why
he can't let Troy go.

335
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:53,834
Yeah, well,
now it's too late.

336
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:56,166
And Troy...
This isn't what he wanted.

337
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,750
Hey, you know,
I'm worried.

338
00:11:58,792 --> 00:12:00,041
Amelia?

339
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,041
Yeah, Amelia.

340
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,250
Join the club.

341
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:03,458
No, we have to do something.

342
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,667
I've tried
talking to her.

343
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:05,875
She shut you down, too?

344
00:12:05,917 --> 00:12:07,041
Repeatedly.

345
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,458
That's not good.
She has to talk to someone.

346
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,625
I mean, this pregnancy
is rife with--it's tragic,

347
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:12,041
and given her past, i--

348
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,625
well, she's not talking
to us,

349
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:15,250
but Jake is helping her.

350
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,625
With what?

351
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:18,041
He's her o.B.

352
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,375
That's it?

353
00:12:19,417 --> 00:12:20,583
What do you want me
to say?

354
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,000
Well, if it's not me,
it should be you.

355
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,583
I mean, c--who's Jake?

356
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:26,458
Jake is who she chose.

357
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,375
The baby's fetal heart rate
is strong. That's--

358
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:32,083
that's good news.

359
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,000
Are you planning a slip?

360
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:37,250
My wife used to
play with one of those

361
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,041
when she was planning
a slip.

362
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,625
You don't plan a slip.

363
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:42,875
That's... that's why
they call it a slip.

364
00:12:42,917 --> 00:12:45,125
It's just...

365
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,625
You fall.

366
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:49,291
Sometimes.
Sometimes you fall.

367
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,041
My wife used to plan 'em.

368
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,625
I didn't know
you had a wife.

369
00:12:53,667 --> 00:12:56,875
Are you...
Planning a slip?

370
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,125
You still married?

371
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:01,667
No.
Are you planning a slip?

372
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:03,041
Divorced?

373
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,500
If you use drugs, your baby
can't be a donor.

374
00:13:04,542 --> 00:13:06,041
What happened
with your wife?

375
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,667
Did you hear me?

376
00:13:09,417 --> 00:13:11,500
What happened
with your wife?

377
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,875
Your baby's heart rate
is strong.

378
00:13:14,917 --> 00:13:17,083
Let's keep it that way.

379
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,125
Hey.

380
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,333
Hey.

381
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:24,542
You busy?

382
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,041
Yeah, I have a laceration
I have to repair.

383
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,875
Can it wait?
I really need some answers
about the house.

384
00:13:27,917 --> 00:13:29,542
Violet, whatever you want
is fine.

385
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:30,750
Pete, this is crazy.

386
00:13:30,792 --> 00:13:31,959
We have to find some time
to talk.

387
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,041
I'm in the middle
of a double shift.

388
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,125
Tomorrow.

389
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,333
I'm working then, too.

390
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:36,542
Are you the only
E.R. doctor in L.A.?

391
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:37,750
Come on.
There--there has to be

392
00:13:37,792 --> 00:13:39,041
some time for us
to have a meal.

393
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:40,125
Meet me for breakfast.

394
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,709
We can eat in that damn
cafeteria here if you want--

395
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,041
why?
What would that accomplish?

396
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:44,709
We're separated, Violet.

397
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,041
Clearly, what I think
doesn't matter.

398
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,291
I pay half the mortgage
on that house,

399
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,625
but I'm not allowed
to sleep in it.

400
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:50,542
I say,
"let's get back together,"

401
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,125
you say,
"no, let's do therapy."
Okay, you know what?

402
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,750
If you are mad at me, that's
fine, but this concerns Lucas...

403
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:55,208
Oh, are you kidding me?
So you have to deal.

404
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,166
The only thing I care about
is Lucas.

405
00:13:57,208 --> 00:14:00,375
I would see him every single day
if you would let me,

406
00:14:00,417 --> 00:14:03,041
but I have assigned times
when I get to be with my child.

407
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,709
And given everything
that's going on,

408
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,500
do you honestly think
I care about that house?

409
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:09,500
So sell it. Don't sell it.

410
00:14:09,542 --> 00:14:11,291
Just leave me out of it.

411
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,083
Hey,
is she talking to you?

412
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,792
What? Who?

413
00:14:15,834 --> 00:14:17,542
Amelia. Addison said
she's talking to you.

414
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,375
She's my patient,
and I'll tell you

415
00:14:19,417 --> 00:14:20,542
the same thing
I told Addison.

416
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:21,834
I can't disclose--

417
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,041
that's crap.
She's our colleague, okay?

418
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,041
She's our friend.
And she's my patient.

419
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,834
And we share information
at this practice.

420
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,625
Sometimes, when a patient's
health requires it.

421
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:30,041
And I would argue that our
patient's health is in danger.

422
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,250
And as a therapist--
look, Sheldon--

423
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,667
she's an addict, Jake.

424
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:34,041
Yeah, I was at the intervention.
I'm fully aware of that.

425
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,417
Then do something about it.

426
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,375
She's not talking to
her friends, she's shut down,

427
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:39,834
she's practically dissociative,
and you have a responsibility

428
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,834
to do everything you can
to help,

429
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,208
and that means helping her
stay clean.

430
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,834
And you think helping her
means I tell you

431
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,250
everything she confides in me?

432
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,667
I'm a shrink,
and I know her, so yes.

433
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:49,792
That's presumptuous.

434
00:14:49,834 --> 00:14:51,667
Get your ego out of it.
My ego?

435
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:53,041
It's not about my ego.

436
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,417
Oh, then let me help you
help her.

437
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:55,875
Sheldon, you're emotional
and you're overstepping

438
00:14:55,917 --> 00:14:57,875
so just back off.

439
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,166
Amelia. Amelia.

440
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:05,375
What?

441
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:06,583
If you want, I can talk
to rich and Lori alone,

442
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,000
go over the medical options--

443
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,375
did you somehow complete
your neurosurgery residency

444
00:15:09,417 --> 00:15:10,583
on your honeymoon?

445
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,000
You're about to pitch
a risky procedure

446
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:13,375
to a desperate couple,
okay?

447
00:15:13,417 --> 00:15:15,834
I'd like to make sure you have
your head in the right place.

448
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,041
26.

449
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,208
That's the number of surgeries

450
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,083
I have completed
since you left--

451
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,709
26 flawless surgeries--

452
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,834
and in each one, I was
a recovering addict

453
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,542
carrying the brainless baby
of her boyfriend who overdosed,

454
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,041
so don't even
for a second suggest

455
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:29,625
that I can't
compartmentalize.

456
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:32,667
It's the only way I survive.

457
00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:35,041
Pete refused
to talk to me.

458
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:37,542
He'd rather stay in the E.R.
stitching up bloody injuries

459
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,041
than spend time
talking to me.

460
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,500
Why are you so smiley?

461
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:44,500
I just...

462
00:15:44,542 --> 00:15:46,250
Uh, it used to be you
giving me advice

463
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:49,208
about my screwed up life,
and...

464
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,834
It's not a mess anymore.

465
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,625
I mean,
I have this amazing wife,

466
00:15:52,667 --> 00:15:54,208
this incredible kid.

467
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,750
But I mean, I'm keeping
all that to myself

468
00:15:55,792 --> 00:15:57,041
because we're talking
about you right now.

469
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,458
Uh, so Pete...

470
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,750
Is hiding out
in the E.R., right?

471
00:16:01,792 --> 00:16:03,041
And I get why. I do.

472
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,750
That's a place where
he can be effective,

473
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:07,125
and he's a hero in there,
and he can solve problems.

474
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,542
In our relationship,
things are messy,

475
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:09,959
there's no right answer,

476
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,750
but I'm not really
that repellant, am I?

477
00:16:11,792 --> 00:16:13,875
Am I?

478
00:16:13,917 --> 00:16:15,041
What? No!

479
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,709
No. It--it hurts for me
to see you like this,

480
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,959
and I'm trying to come up
with something to say

481
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,917
that's gonna put you and Pete
back together.

482
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:23,542
But I mean, is that
really the best thing?

483
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:26,041
What do you mean?

484
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:30,041
I mean, you and Pete and Lucas
are a great family.

485
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:33,917
But are you and Pete
a great couple?

486
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:35,917
I saw your patient Stephanie.

487
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:37,041
Was it
a placental abruption?

488
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,041
Yeah, a minor one.

489
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,625
A few days bed rest,
she'll be fine.

490
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:41,375
I'm sure she's thrilled.

491
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,291
And she'll have her baby
in six weeks.

492
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,000
Yeah.

493
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,041
Do you ever wonder about

494
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,375
I don't know, what happens
to all these kids

495
00:16:49,417 --> 00:16:51,041
that you give people?

496
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,500
Well, sometimes the parents

497
00:16:52,542 --> 00:16:53,917
bring them by
so I can meet them.

498
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:55,041
I get the holiday cards.

499
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,125
Do you like that?

500
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,542
Sure.

501
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:01,000
Gosh. I mean, to a parent,

502
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,625
your baby's the most important
thing in the world.

503
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:06,041
I mean, I think about Henry...
All the time.

504
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,041
I talk about him all the time,
too, until, you know,

505
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,041
I'm sure that people don't want
to hear another word.

506
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,417
But I really, i--
really, I can't help it.

507
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:15,375
No, listen, it's fine.
You should enjoy him.

508
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:20,417
What?
What's so funny?

509
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,333
Sam was over this morning.

510
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,834
I was asking him
for some parenting advice.

511
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:27,875
And he said the exact
same thing. "Just enjoy him."

512
00:17:27,917 --> 00:17:29,041
Well, that's kind of ironic.

513
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,041
What, the two of you
giving the same advice?

514
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,750
That you're asking it
from Sam.

515
00:17:33,792 --> 00:17:36,709
E-Ever since Henry's come,
you know, I mean, Sam's...

516
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,041
Yeah, he's been great.

517
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,291
Oh, I'm sure.

518
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,291
Hey, thanks for
the patient update.

519
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:46,083
This scarring is likely
causing you to have seizures.

520
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,000
What happened
in Dr. Wallace's office,

521
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,041
I-I had never
had that before.

522
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,458
But chances are,

523
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,792
you'd experienced hundreds
of minor seizures

524
00:17:53,834 --> 00:17:56,250
prior to that one, and because
the seizures are occurring

525
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,041
in the part of your brain
that regulates impulses,

526
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,333
that might explain the urges.

527
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:01,709
Can we do anything
about it?

528
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,041
I can do a partial lobectomy
to remove the scarring

529
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,458
and stop the seizures.

530
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,583
And rich
would be normal again?

531
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,083
Well, that's the hope,
but we can't tell

532
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:11,458
if this will mean he can
control all of his impulses

533
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,417
we have Whitney to think about.

534
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,667
Of course, but what
she's saying is that maybe

535
00:18:15,709 --> 00:18:18,250
this isn't rich's fault,
maybe it's not him.

536
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:19,959
Well, either way,
you need to understand

537
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,834
that there are substantial risks
to this procedure.

538
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,291
With any brain surgery,

539
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,333
there's the possibility
of permanent damage or death--

540
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,041
I don't care.

541
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,750
If there is even a chance

542
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:32,709
that this will make me better,
I want to do it.

543
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,125
The ventilator

544
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,750
is helping Troy oxygenate,

545
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:41,208
uh, but his cardiac output
is still down.

546
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,041
What are our options?

547
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:46,041
We could put him
on an l-vad pump,

548
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,083
give him a little extra time,
but, uh--

549
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,709
but what?

550
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,041
We'd just be postponing
the inevitable.

551
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,041
Troy is going to die.

552
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,959
Now I understand that
the relationship

553
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,041
between you and Troy
is strained,

554
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:01,333
but if Troy doesn't want
to be kept alive by machines,

555
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,709
if--if you don't mind
me asking,

556
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,041
why are you doing this?

557
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,959
When Troy was growing up,

558
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,542
he was my boy.

559
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:14,667
I knew him, how he thought,
what mattered to him.

560
00:19:14,709 --> 00:19:16,583
Roger turned him around,

561
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:20,041
made him believe things.

562
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:22,750
How do I even know this is
really what Troy wants?

563
00:19:22,792 --> 00:19:25,625
This is probably gonna be hard
for you to hear,

564
00:19:25,667 --> 00:19:28,709
but I believe that Roger
really loves Troy.

565
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,417
So I don't think he'd ever
lie about something like this.

566
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:34,000
I really don't think
he'd be willing to lose him.

567
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,417
Put him on the pump.

568
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,208
Well, this is either gonna
be awesome or terrible.

569
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,959
Take your pants off.

570
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,208
Awesome.

571
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,458
Mm.

572
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,041
Oh, what's gotten into you?

573
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,041
Pete.
Oh. Ew!

574
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,625
No, it's just, he's--

575
00:19:57,667 --> 00:19:59,875
Pete's being a royal pain
in my ass at the hospital,

576
00:19:59,917 --> 00:20:01,667
making me the bad guy,
and you know how I hate...

577
00:20:01,709 --> 00:20:03,208
Come on.
Being the bad guy.

578
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,041
No, this was so promising.
Mm.

579
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,667
Is everything all right
with him?

580
00:20:06,709 --> 00:20:10,041
Every free shift I've got,
he's... picking it up,

581
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,667
like he's on some kind
of a mission.

582
00:20:11,709 --> 00:20:13,041
Okay, he is on a mission.
He's hiding from Violet.
Why?

583
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:14,792
Okay, if I answer this,

584
00:20:14,834 --> 00:20:16,625
can we...
Get back to business?

585
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:17,834
Yes.

586
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,834
Okay, Violet feels
that Pete is avoiding her

587
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,041
'cause he doesn't want to do
the necessary work

588
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,125
to save the relationship.

589
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,500
You know, first he wanted
to go to El Salvador,

590
00:20:23,542 --> 00:20:25,083
he's working around the clock
in the E.R.

591
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,917
It's bad for Violet.
It's worse for Lucas.

592
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,834
She's afraid that Pete's being
self-destructive so she's--

593
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,458
enough. I've got it.

594
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,041
Now I want you to be
the bad guy for a while.

595
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,875
Okay.

596
00:20:36,417 --> 00:20:38,000
Hey there.

597
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,166
Hey.

598
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,000
You finishing up
or just starting out?

599
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:43,834
Well, starting.
Or hoping to start.

600
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,834
What--what if Henry
wakes up?

601
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:48,166
Well, then you pour yourself
another glass.

602
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,500
I'm serious.

603
00:20:49,542 --> 00:20:50,917
Addison, you're allowed
to have a glass of wine.

604
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:52,375
You're allowed to have
many glasses of wine.

605
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,417
Okay, so he wakes up,
and I'm drunk.

606
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:57,542
You're not gonna be too drunk
to take care of him.

607
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:01,417
Besides... you know, babies
are virtually indestructible.

608
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,291
Take that.

609
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:04,917
Are you gonna
make me drink alone?

610
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:06,750
Well, somebody's gotta
be here for Henry, right?

611
00:21:06,792 --> 00:21:08,083
Funny.

612
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:11,458
Let me get some.

613
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,041
Ohh. I miss this.

614
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,250
What, the quiet?

615
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,041
No, just sitting with wine,

616
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,125
not thinking about anything,
just...

617
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,041
Being.

618
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,959
Yeah.

619
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:26,542
We used to do this.

620
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,792
Yeah, well,
now you have Henry.

621
00:21:30,834 --> 00:21:32,917
Mm.

622
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:34,166
Mm.

623
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:37,000
I miss this, too.

624
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,125
I miss you.

625
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,750
Sam--

626
00:21:46,709 --> 00:21:48,959
Go get him.

627
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,917
Yell at me.

628
00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:06,041
You want to yell at me.
Yell at me.

629
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:08,166
All right? I can take it.

630
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:11,083
I wish I had been here.

631
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:13,083
I wish I had come back.

632
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:15,083
Amelia...

633
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,500
I want to help you.

634
00:22:16,542 --> 00:22:18,041
So please...

635
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:20,000
Just let me help you.

636
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:30,041
No, Amelia--
don't talk.

637
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:32,041
Just don't talk, okay?

638
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:34,041
You said you want to help.
This is how you can help me.

639
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:35,208
No, Amelia--

640
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,750
I know
I'm not sexy right now.

641
00:22:36,792 --> 00:22:38,417
I don't--i don't need you
to think I'm sexy.

642
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:41,208
Just... close your eyes
and think about someone else.

643
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,041
I don't care what you do,
just...

644
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:44,208
Sheldon, this is
what I need.

645
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,625
Look, Amelia, just stop.

646
00:22:45,667 --> 00:22:49,709
If you want to help me,
help me forget. Please.

647
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:53,041
Did you take something?

648
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:54,375
Are you high?

649
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,542
If I were high,

650
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:00,959
I wouldn't need you,
Sheldon.

651
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,041
If I were high,
I would be able to breathe,

652
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,417
to forget.

653
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:08,208
I'm not high.

654
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,875
An orgasm would help me.

655
00:23:10,917 --> 00:23:13,291
It would help me
for a minute.

656
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:15,667
I need a minute.

657
00:23:15,709 --> 00:23:18,083
If I am gonna keep carrying
this baby and give birth to him,

658
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:20,458
I need an escape, Sheldon.

659
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,417
I need a minute to forget.

660
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:25,375
Please.

661
00:23:25,417 --> 00:23:27,625
Amelia...

662
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:31,750
I'm sorry.

663
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:37,166
There's that word again.

664
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:49,041
Hey, buddy.

665
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:50,417
Hey, man.

666
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:51,625
You, uh, you feel like
grabbing a drink tonight?

667
00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:53,041
Rain check?
Oh, you got plans?

668
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:54,834
I was just trying
to get home early, relax...

669
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:56,667
Head next door,
change a few diapers.

670
00:23:57,917 --> 00:23:59,083
Are you for real?

671
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:00,208
Hey, I'm not judging.

672
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,333
Judging?
What's there to judge?

673
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:03,542
You, Addison, Henry.

674
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:05,417
Right, they live next door.
And?

675
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:06,625
Sounds convenient.

676
00:24:06,667 --> 00:24:08,667
What do you--what do you
think is going on?

677
00:24:08,709 --> 00:24:10,709
I don't know.
Is something going on?

678
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,041
Are you jealous?

679
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,542
Oh, come on, man.
You know that's not my thing.

680
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:14,750
Oh, and it's my thing?

681
00:24:14,792 --> 00:24:15,959
Well,
you kept saying it wasn't,

682
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,250
so I have to take you
at your word, right?

683
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:18,667
Well, I think
you are jealous.

684
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:21,000
No. I'm the man who's
going out for a drink tonight.

685
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:25,375
Dr. Wilder.

686
00:24:25,417 --> 00:24:27,333
Roger.
You have to see this.

687
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:30,041
What?

688
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:31,500
"I could never just linger
like that.

689
00:24:31,542 --> 00:24:32,917
"Roger would go ballistic.

690
00:24:32,959 --> 00:24:35,792
He'd sit by my bedside,
sure I was gonna wake up."

691
00:24:35,834 --> 00:24:37,500
I don't--
what--what is this?

692
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:39,041
It's from Troy's journal.

693
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:40,375
He keeps one on his computer.

694
00:24:40,417 --> 00:24:42,125
And I stayed up all night
reading it

695
00:24:42,166 --> 00:24:44,083
because I wanted
to find some proof

696
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:45,291
that this isn't
what he wants,

697
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:46,709
and it says so right here.

698
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,917
Roger, that--uh,
it's not a legal document.

699
00:24:48,959 --> 00:24:50,709
I know that you're in pain
and you're angry,

700
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,083
and I want to help you--

701
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:55,000
Troy is suspended between
here and the other side.

702
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:56,375
Now I love him
and I have to give him

703
00:24:56,417 --> 00:24:58,041
the peace that he deserves,

704
00:24:58,083 --> 00:25:01,041
but...

705
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:02,750
Do you get that?

706
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,500
Do you understand love?

707
00:25:04,542 --> 00:25:07,041
When you love somebody,
when you really love them,

708
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:10,625
you don't force them to stay,
to fight, to hang on.

709
00:25:10,667 --> 00:25:14,500
You let them go the way
that they want to go.

710
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,417
How much longer
do you think it'll take?

711
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:22,041
He goes into surgery
in an hour.

712
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:24,417
You know it's okay
to feel scared.

713
00:25:24,458 --> 00:25:26,041
But I don't want to be,

714
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:28,333
and I don't really know
why I am.

715
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:30,041
'Cause this is scary...

716
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:32,625
Being in a hospital,

717
00:25:32,667 --> 00:25:34,959
knowing your dad
is in there,

718
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,750
seeing your mom
so stressed.

719
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,625
I heard her on the phone
last night

720
00:25:39,667 --> 00:25:41,041
with my uncle.

721
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:44,000
She told him my dad
could die from the surgery.

722
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:46,458
Is that
what you're scared of?

723
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:57,583
I know that it's confusing
and complicated,

724
00:25:57,625 --> 00:26:01,458
but it is still okay
to love your dad.

725
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,041
I love him.

726
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:07,041
It's just what he did.

727
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:08,625
What he did was horrible,

728
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:13,041
and I imagine you've had
a lot of bad days since.

729
00:26:13,083 --> 00:26:15,500
But you have to promise me
something, Whitney.

730
00:26:15,542 --> 00:26:17,625
Promise me that you're not
gonna feel bad

731
00:26:17,667 --> 00:26:19,625
about trying to live
in the good ones, okay,

732
00:26:19,667 --> 00:26:21,041
the good days?

733
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:23,041
Because you may not be able
to forgive him,

734
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:26,792
you may not feel like
you're ever able to...

735
00:26:26,834 --> 00:26:28,291
To trust him
in the same way again,

736
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:30,959
but... but you don't
get to choose

737
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,041
whether you love him
or not.

738
00:26:34,083 --> 00:26:36,458
We just love 'em.

739
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:42,041
I can't--i can't--
I mean, he's just--

740
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:43,542
whoa. Breathe.
Breathe. Breathe.
I mean, it's not only...

741
00:26:43,583 --> 00:26:45,667
Breathe. Breathe.
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

742
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:53,125
Okay.
Try complete sentences.

743
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:55,959
I can't give up. I don't
want to let him go.

744
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,250
I don't.

745
00:26:57,291 --> 00:26:58,875
Does that make me pathetic?

746
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:00,542
Is that what you were
telling me before?

747
00:27:00,583 --> 00:27:02,667
I mean, without telling me.

748
00:27:02,709 --> 00:27:04,083
Wh-when you said that--that--

749
00:27:04,125 --> 00:27:05,917
that Pete and I were not
a good couple, were--

750
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:07,875
do you really think I should
cut my losses and go?

751
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:10,041
Vi, all I meant to say was--
no, you know what?
You know what?

752
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:11,500
I-I-I don't care.

753
00:27:11,542 --> 00:27:14,041
I don't care what it makes me.
I-I don't care what you think.

754
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:16,041
I, um... I love Pete.

755
00:27:16,083 --> 00:27:18,083
I love my family.

756
00:27:18,125 --> 00:27:20,500
And I just want us
to be okay.

757
00:27:20,542 --> 00:27:22,041
And I know we are not
one of those storybook couples

758
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:23,500
with stars in our eyes

759
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:25,709
and cartoon hearts
floating above our heads.

760
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,041
I mean, we have been tested.

761
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:28,583
God knows, this relationship
has been tested,

762
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:30,083
and we have survived.

763
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:31,291
So, you know,
to hell with easy.

764
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:32,500
I don't trust easy.

765
00:27:32,542 --> 00:27:33,875
Anything worth having
shouldn't be easy,

766
00:27:33,917 --> 00:27:35,250
because then you take it
for granted.

767
00:27:35,291 --> 00:27:36,792
Pete is worth fighting for.

768
00:27:36,834 --> 00:27:39,333
My family
is worth fighting for.

769
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:42,125
And I am so sick to death
of asking him to listen to me.

770
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:43,333
I'm not gonna ask anymore.

771
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:44,750
I'm gonna go down
to St. ambrose

772
00:27:44,792 --> 00:27:46,333
and I'm gonna haul his
immature ass out of that E.R.,

773
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:48,542
and we are going
to figure out what to do,

774
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,333
because I want my...

775
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:52,417
Stubborn, infuriating...

776
00:27:52,458 --> 00:27:55,041
Amazing husband back.

777
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:57,959
Why are you staring at me?

778
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,083
I don't know whether
to be scared or awed.

779
00:28:01,125 --> 00:28:03,709
I think
that when there's clearly

780
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,750
a right way and a wrong way,
you choose the right way,

781
00:28:05,792 --> 00:28:07,041
no matter how hard it is.

782
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:08,625
Well, we don't agree
on what the right way is.

783
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:10,083
I know Troy,

784
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:12,041
and I understand what Troy
and Roger have together

785
00:28:12,083 --> 00:28:13,375
and the situation they're in.

786
00:28:13,417 --> 00:28:15,000
And it's awful.
It's--it's unfair--

787
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:17,041
oh, come on, Sam.
You're taking the easy way out.

788
00:28:17,083 --> 00:28:18,667
You're hiding behind the rules
just like Charlotte.

789
00:28:18,709 --> 00:28:20,166
First off, I'm not hiding
behind anything.

790
00:28:20,208 --> 00:28:21,875
I'm respecting the process,

791
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:23,041
even if I don't like
the result--

792
00:28:23,083 --> 00:28:24,667
who gives a damn
about the process?

793
00:28:24,709 --> 00:28:26,166
Look, it's what we have
to live with.

794
00:28:26,208 --> 00:28:28,583
No. No. What we have to
live with is our conscience.

795
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:30,041
Look, all right, I understand
where you're coming from--

796
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,667
but you don't give a damn.
Oh, come on, man.

797
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:33,375
No, no, you've made it
very clear whose side you're on.

798
00:28:33,417 --> 00:28:34,583
You're not being fair.

799
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:36,041
No,
you're not being fair, Sam.

800
00:28:41,583 --> 00:28:43,875
Okay, rich,
are you ready?

801
00:28:43,917 --> 00:28:45,458
Just one thing.

802
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,917
What is it?

803
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:48,458
If you can't get
all the lesion,

804
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,917
if you can't fix me,
kill me.

805
00:28:58,083 --> 00:28:59,667
Everything went smoothly.
I got it all.

806
00:29:01,834 --> 00:29:03,041
Will I...

807
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:04,834
You need time.

808
00:29:06,083 --> 00:29:08,875
Dr. Turner.

809
00:29:08,917 --> 00:29:11,000
So I'm gonna continue
seeing Whitney.

810
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:13,000
And you will continue
with Dr. Wallace.

811
00:29:13,041 --> 00:29:14,792
Of course.
You can't go home yet.

812
00:29:14,834 --> 00:29:16,166
Not until both of us agree

813
00:29:16,208 --> 00:29:18,125
that it's the best thing
to do for your family.

814
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:21,625
Thank you...

815
00:29:21,667 --> 00:29:24,500
For giving me a chance.

816
00:29:26,792 --> 00:29:29,291
Think you're ready
for a couple of visitors?

817
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:44,041
I promise, whit, I will
spend the rest of my days

818
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:47,750
doing everything I can
to earn back your trust.

819
00:29:47,792 --> 00:29:50,166
I really hope I can.

820
00:29:59,792 --> 00:30:02,041
Dr. Turner,

821
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:03,709
how's...

822
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:06,041
Is she okay?

823
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:08,166
She's brave

824
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:12,000
and she's hopeful.

825
00:30:16,542 --> 00:30:19,041
You really think
rich will be okay?

826
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:22,041
I have to believe that.

827
00:30:22,083 --> 00:30:23,709
I did everything I could,

828
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,500
and you're gonna do
everything that you can,

829
00:30:25,542 --> 00:30:27,834
and the alternative...

830
00:30:27,875 --> 00:30:29,875
Is too awful to contemplate.

831
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:33,166
Well, sometimes
things work out,

832
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:36,333
even when you didn't think
they could.

833
00:30:38,625 --> 00:30:40,000
Amelia, about last night--

834
00:30:40,041 --> 00:30:41,792
I have to go.

835
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:47,041
This place baffles me.

836
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:49,583
It's a bunch of doctors
sticking their noses

837
00:30:49,625 --> 00:30:51,625
in places
where noses don't belong,

838
00:30:51,667 --> 00:30:55,291
or at least places I would
never think of sticking mine.

839
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:57,125
I mean, for family, yes,
for someone I love,

840
00:30:57,166 --> 00:30:58,625
but this is an office.

841
00:30:58,667 --> 00:31:01,208
Yeah, but people around here,
w-we are family.

842
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,834
We care about each other.

843
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:05,542
And you obviously
care about Amelia.

844
00:31:05,583 --> 00:31:07,375
Of course I care,
but I'm not sure

845
00:31:07,417 --> 00:31:10,458
being all up in her business
is the best way to help.

846
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,583
Well, then do it your way.

847
00:31:13,834 --> 00:31:15,458
So what are you still
doing here anyway?

848
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,041
Oh, I am just
finishing up stuff.

849
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:20,417
Who's watching your baby?

850
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:21,959
Sam?

851
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,041
Shut up.

852
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:25,375
Don't laugh at me.

853
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:28,041
Oh, it's not you
I'm laughing at.

854
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:30,125
You're getting everything
you wanted, right?

855
00:31:30,166 --> 00:31:33,166
Well, I didn't...
Think about it like that.

856
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:35,792
Well, isn't this what
you've been hoping for?
