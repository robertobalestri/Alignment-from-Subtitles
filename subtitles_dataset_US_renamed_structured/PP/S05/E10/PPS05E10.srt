And, Evan, I'm guessing
we'll be using your sperm?

78
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,542

00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,792

Well, Evan isn't just
an anonymous sperm donor.

88
00:03:33,917 --> 00:03:35,041
He's obviously a part
of your lives,

89
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,667

will continue to be, right?

00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:39,041
But isn't that better?

91
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,375
It's not about better
or worse.

92
00:03:41,417 --> 00:03:44,000
It's about a situation that has
some potential complications.

93
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:46,458

to be involved in the pregnancy

94

96

Yep, right there

111
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,959
Okay, you'll need
to test that monthly.

112
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,834

once a year.

113
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,834

set in my calendar.

114
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,208

I can't imagine ever letting
that baby out of my arms,

121
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,000
but, uh, if I do,

122
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:51,125
I will not let her or him
go outside.

123
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,125
I mean, the sun

124

125
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:58,250
cases of skin cancer are
reported each year, but...

126
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:02,500

beyond my purview.

127
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,375
That was a joke, right?

128
00:05:09,417 --> 00:05:11,166

129
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,750

131
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,083

133
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:36,959

135
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,917
I seriously can't believe

136
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,792
you've never heard
of tinkertoys.

137
00:05:41,834 --> 00:05:43,041
I spent,
like, half my childhood

138
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,000
building forts
and castles to play in.

139
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:46,834
You're gonna love it.

140

Maybe next time, okay?

145
00:06:01,917 --> 00:06:04,000
I'll meet you outside, dad.

146
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,125
Can you add a pack of cards
to that, too, please?

147
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,333
So, Evan, how do you
see your role

148
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,542
in this baby's life?

149
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,125
Donate the sperm,
build the crib,

150
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,834
and then I just kind of
want to be the fun uncle--

151
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,875
water fights
and movie nights,

152
00:06:18,917 --> 00:06:20,125
no diapers.

153
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,125
Which is great, because I'll
be home with the baby.

154
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,333
Rosie works, so...

155
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,750
And those roles
are great for now,

156
00:06:25,792 --> 00:06:28,041
but as a baby grows,
things do change.

157
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:31,000
Problems come up,
arguments happen,

158
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,834
and if Evan disagrees with
any of your parenting choices,

159
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,208
he would,
as the biological father,

160
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,625
have legal standing

161
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:39,041
unless you
specify otherwise now.

162
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,166
Like in a contract?

163
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:42,166
Yeah. Well,
in most situations,

164
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,417
a contract
is not a bad idea.

165
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,000
What would it say,

166
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:47,041
that I don't have any right
to be involved with the baby?

167
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,166
It can say
whatever you want.

168
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,166
It's just a formality.

169
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,667
But that feels so...
Business-like

170
00:06:52,709 --> 00:06:55,166
and this is not
a business decision.

171
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,375
No, but if it's what
people normally do--

172
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,041
we're having a baby, Rose,
not closing a deal.

173
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,834
Yeah, I agree
with Kendra.

174
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,875
It feels impersonal.

175
00:07:03,917 --> 00:07:05,834
R-Rose,

176
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,083
is there something you would
like to say to Evan?

177
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,750
No, not right now.

178
00:07:08,792 --> 00:07:09,959
Come on, Rose.

179
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,041
We'll talk about it later.

180
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:12,125
Rosie...

181
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,625
Guys, I'm a therapist.

182
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:16,500
There's very little that I
haven't seen or heard.

183
00:07:16,542 --> 00:07:19,208
And this is not a place
of judgment.

184
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,083
But getting what you want

185
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,667
has to start
with the truth.

186
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,125
So...

187
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,667
We're in love.

188
00:07:31,709 --> 00:07:33,500
Okay.

189
00:07:33,542 --> 00:07:36,000
We're...

190
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,125
All in love.

191
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,041
Whatcha doin'?

192
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,125
Oh, I'm just trying

193
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,125
to maximize my ten minutes
between patients.

194
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:52,041
I got kinda
jammed up today.

195
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,500
Feel like taking a break
at lunch

196
00:07:53,542 --> 00:07:55,166
for pizza and pins?

197
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,750
Greasy slices,

198
00:07:56,792 --> 00:07:58,500
slippery bowling balls,
my treat.

199
00:07:58,542 --> 00:08:00,667
Well, that sounds like fun,
but I don't know

200
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:02,792
if my digestive track
could handle it,

201
00:08:02,834 --> 00:08:05,041
plus, uh...
I hate putting on shoes

202
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:08,000
that a hundred other people
have worn before me, you know--

203
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,417
oh, come on.
It'll be fun.

204
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:12,083
I'll even buy
the pepto and purell.

205
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:15,000
Thanks, but, uh...
Maybe some other time.

206
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,583
Hey. I was
just looking for you.

207
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,291
And now you found me.

208
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,500
You busy today?

209
00:08:24,542 --> 00:08:26,041
I'm pretty much
caught up on my charts.

210
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,500
A couple of patients
are coming in--

211
00:08:27,542 --> 00:08:29,834
are you ready
to cut again?

212
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,291
A patient with
an obstructive neurosarcoid

213
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,083
was scheduled
for this afternoon,

214
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,041
but buddle's coming off
an all-nighter,

215
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,041
and I need someone.

216
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,625
Well, I thought I might
assist a few before i--

217
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:40,208
either you're ready to come
back to the hospital and work

218
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,667
or you're not.

219
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm ready.

220
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,750
I'm definitely ready.

221
00:08:47,792 --> 00:08:49,000
Good.

222
00:08:54,417 --> 00:08:56,041
We know it sounds crazy.

223
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,000
I understand being in love.
I'm not judging.

224
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,750
You are.
Everyone judges us.

225
00:08:59,792 --> 00:09:02,750
But we appreciate how hard
you're trying not to.

226
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,166
Okay.

227
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,667
Well, tell me
about yourselves.

228
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:08,166
The first night was...

229
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,458
It was amazing.

230
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,959
The first night
usually is.

231
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,041
But so was the next morning.

232
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,792
And every morning
after that.

233
00:09:13,834 --> 00:09:14,875
Most mornings.

234
00:09:14,917 --> 00:09:16,417
It--it sounds very easy.

235
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,375
It's not.
We have rules.

236
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:20,625
Every decision
has to be unanimous.

237
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:22,000
We have to avoid
the two against one

238
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,083
so no one feels
ganged up on.
Okay.

239
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:26,041
Y-You are
talking about things

240
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:29,041
that are in the context
of the relationship.

241
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,250
But there is a world
out there,

242
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:34,083
the world that you would be
raising your child in.

243
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:36,250
And that world
is not quite as accepting

244
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:37,500
about things
that don't appear--

245
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:39,500
normal?

246
00:09:39,542 --> 00:09:42,166
I come from a home where there
wasn't a lot of love.

247
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,250
There was a lot of...

248
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,458
Commitment--

249
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,291
35 years of marriage--

250
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,542
and a lot of what people
call normal,

251
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,417
but not much love.

252
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:54,000
Kendra and Rose and me...

253
00:09:57,667 --> 00:10:00,000
There's a lot of love here.

254
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,041
A-A what?

255
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,417
A polyamorous triad.

256
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,458
Three people in a committed,
monogamous relationship.

257
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,041
I can barely keep up
with one partner.

258
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,625
I can't imagine
trying to satisfy two.

259
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:11,834
There's no way that works.

260
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,083
Every couple, or triad,
is different.

261
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,667
You know,
you can't generalize.

262
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:16,208
It doesn't matter what they are.
They lied to me.

263
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,834
Well, because their
lifestyle's unconventional,

264
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,959
they're probably used to
being criticized and mocked--

265
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,208
For good reason.

266
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,291
I mean, hey, can we just pause
the moral and ethical debate

267
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,959
and criticize and mock them
for a minute?

268
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,166
It's just weird.

269
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:28,542
It's weird.

270
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:29,959
Four boobs, two geegers...

271
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,792
It's not weird.
It's fantastic.

272
00:10:31,834 --> 00:10:33,041
Wow.
Yeah, you know what?

273
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,333
You just brought it
to a whole other level.

274
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,041
Yep.
Life is already so difficult.
Why make it harder?

275
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,125
Yeah, but that's
the same argument

276
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:38,750
that said that interracial

277
00:10:38,792 --> 00:10:40,583
and same-sex couples
shouldn't have children.

278
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:42,959
Hey, I was ready to help out
an honest lesbian couple.

279
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,375
So wait.
Is it the dishonesty

280
00:10:44,417 --> 00:10:46,333
or the polyamory
that you take issue with?

281
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:47,542
The lying.

282
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:48,750
Okay, well,
separate that out.

283
00:10:48,792 --> 00:10:50,041
These people
are in a tough spot.

284
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,917
Society is not ready
for them.

285
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:53,458
Oh, are we still talking about
this? Sam is right.

286
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,709
It is just plain weird.

287
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,959
Thank you, baby.

288
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,083
Addison Montgomery.

289
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,417
Really?

290
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,041
Is she...

291
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:04,041
Uh, yes, yes, I do.
A-Absolutely, I do.

292
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,917
Thank you very much.
Good-bye.

293
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:07,041
Uh...

294
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,417
That was my lawyer,

295
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:11,041
and despite the fact that I
misled and slightly fibbed to

296
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,291
the social worker,
she signed off,

297
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,375
and a birth mother
wants to meet me.

298
00:11:14,417 --> 00:11:15,792
Wow.
You know what?

299
00:11:15,834 --> 00:11:17,125
In a lot of places,
a single white woman

300
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,083
living with a single black man
who also happens to be

301
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:20,625
the ex-husband
of her best friend...

302
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:22,041
- Oh, my...
- Oh, wow.

303
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,291
Trying to adopt
a child out of wedlock

304
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:24,709
without the interest
of her boyfriend...
Come on.

305
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,166
Would seem
just plain weird.

306
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,709
Okay, fine.
I take back the weird.

307
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,125
The triad has all my support.

308
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:32,250
In less than a month,
I could be a mother.

309
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,041
Hey, you feelin' okay?

310
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:42,458
Yes.

311
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,583
You sure?
You want to talk?

312
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,041
I'm a little nervous

313
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,166
about meeting
the birth mother, you know?

314
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,417
So, yes, I would like
to talk about it, but i'm...

315
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,041
Pretty sure you don't.

316
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,583
Not about that.

317
00:11:54,917 --> 00:11:56,750
Well...

318
00:11:56,792 --> 00:11:58,500
Good luck.

319
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,000
You're great.

320
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,291
And you're gonna do great.

321
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:13,041
How are you at...

322
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,083
Forgiving?

323
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,792
I mean,
in your personal life.

324
00:12:15,834 --> 00:12:17,041
I know we preach it,

325
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,000
but... can you do it?

326
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,500
Sometimes.

327
00:12:20,542 --> 00:12:21,709
When?

328
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,500
Wh-when the relationship
is worth saving.

329
00:12:24,542 --> 00:12:25,709
We talking about Amelia?

330
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,875
No. We're--we're just
talking about forgiveness.

331
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,208
Oh.

332
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,417
Okay.

333
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,041
Well, uh,
I guess it would depend

334
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,709
on what the offense is.

335
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,125
She crushed me.

336
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,875
Yeah.

337
00:12:41,917 --> 00:12:43,333
And when she was in crisis,
when she was in rehab,

338
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:46,542
it was easy for me to
put aside my own hurt feelings

339
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,291
and my own reactions,
you know?

340
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:51,625
It was easy
just to want to save her.

341
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:54,000
But now, I, uh...

342
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:57,583
I don't want
to make it harder for her.

343
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,917
Well, just give her time.

344
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,041
Is that what you're doing
with Pete?

345
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,625
Yes.

346
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:10,583
Is it working?

347
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:13,333
No.

348
00:13:35,792 --> 00:13:37,709
Dr. Shepherd,
it's good to see you.

349
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,041
We heard
you were on vacation.

350
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:40,291
Did you go somewhere amazing?

351
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,041
This isn't a tea party.

352
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,959
You all have a surgery
to do.

353
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,583
Dr. Shepherd
needs to concentrate.

354
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:46,917
You all do.

355
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,542
Less talk. More focus.

356
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:04,000
Scalpel.

357
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,750
I have one more semester,

358
00:14:08,792 --> 00:14:12,083
then law school.

359
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,417
Yes, please.

360
00:14:16,792 --> 00:14:19,000
Ooh.

361
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,417
Do you think
I'm an awful person

362
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,250
for giving my baby up?

363
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,250
Of course not. I--

364
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,750
oh, please don't humor me.

365
00:14:30,792 --> 00:14:33,542
Please just think about
the question.

366
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,250
Because I'm 20.

367
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,875
I'm not a teenager,

368
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,959
and I have the resources,
you know?

369
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,667
You know,
this isn't necessity.

370
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:45,542
I'm not giving her up
out of necessity.

371
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:48,625
I'm giving her up
because...

372
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:51,041
I don't want
to be a mom at 20.

373
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,875
And I don't want to give her

374
00:14:53,917 --> 00:14:56,917
to anyone who thinks
I'm an awful person.

375
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:04,291
I had an abortion
when I was in my 30s.

376
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:08,041
I was already a surgeon.
My career was in place.

377
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,083
And, uh... I certainly
had the resources,

378
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:13,000
but... I wasn't ready.

379
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,583
So...

380
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,917
I'm not judging you.

381
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,583
Oh, god.

382
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:23,041
And now I really hope
that you're not judging me.

383
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,750
I'm sorry. I probably
shouldn't have told you that.

384
00:15:24,792 --> 00:15:26,542
Oh, no, no, no.
It's not--i mean,
I-I don't want you to think

385
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:27,750
that i-i--

386
00:15:27,792 --> 00:15:29,291
I'm not judging you,
Dr. Montgomery.

387
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,125
Wow. That's just...

388
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,125
I've... never met anyone

389
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,750
who just admitted
to an abortion like that.

390
00:15:37,792 --> 00:15:40,125
It's just that no one
ever talks about that stuff.

391
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:42,458
Certainly not when they're
trying to impress someone.

392
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,041
Oh, not ever.

393
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,458
I mean...

394
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:50,417
We all just pretend like
that stuff doesn't exist.

395
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,750
You're sort of amazing.

396
00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:56,542
So...

397
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,959
Have you met with any other
potential parents?

398
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,583
Well, there's this family
at my church

399
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:04,000
that my mom had me meet.

400
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,917
And they were nice...

401
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,583
But kind of boring.

402
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:11,583
You know, the dad works,
the mom stays home.

403
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:14,041
They already have
a little boy.

404
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,375
Mm.

405
00:16:15,417 --> 00:16:16,792
You're a fetal surgeon?

406
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:18,000
Yes, that's right.

407
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,500
That's pretty awesome.

408
00:16:19,542 --> 00:16:20,917
Thank you.

409
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,041
Real estate listings?

410
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:31,041
Yeah. Violet thinks
I should find my own place.

411
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,917
Wow.

412
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,041
I'm sorry.

413
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,834
How do you feel about that?

414
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,041
I don't know.

415
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:42,041
I don't want to be
a part-time parent to Lucas--

416
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,959
not being with him every day,
missing...

417
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,542
Wake up, bedtime,
bath time, I...

418
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:48,542
And even if I do get
a place that's close by,

419
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,375
it still won't be
his house, you know?

420
00:16:50,417 --> 00:16:52,834
Mm-hmm. Maya used to call
my place...

421
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,417
"Her weekend getaway."

422
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,625
Ugh.

423
00:16:56,667 --> 00:16:58,583
It's tough.
You miss a lot.

424
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,041
Kids kill you.

425
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,417
One way or another.

426
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,542
You and Addison?

427
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,959
Ugh. We're not even
pretending anymore.

428
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,250
It's like, uh,
I don't know,

429
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,375
one of us
just has to say the words,

430
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:12,166
make official what we...

431
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,792
Both already know.

432
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:15,792
Yeah, well,
before you say the words,

433
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,458
just...

434
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,000
Be sure.

435
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,458
In a few months, I could have
a son on that screen.

436
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,041
- Or a daughter.
- Healthy baby.

437
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,250
Gender irrelevant.
Come on, guys.

438
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:29,458
Rose is right.

439
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,667
Okay, Kendra, I'm all done.

440
00:17:30,709 --> 00:17:34,083
Rose,
you want to hop up here?

441
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,291
What?

442
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,792
No, nothing.
It--it's sweet,

443
00:17:41,834 --> 00:17:43,375
the way you all get along
so well.

444
00:17:43,417 --> 00:17:44,709
Seems like
it would be tricky.

445
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,041
He wants to know
about the sex.

446
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,458
No.

447
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,834
- It's okay.
- Everyone does.

448
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:51,041
We have one bed--
California king.

449
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,041
That's enough, Kendra.

450
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,750
Dr. Montgomery,
what is it?

451
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:01,166
I just don't understand
why he would do this?

452
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,875
Because he's 8.
Because he wanted the cards.

453
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,166
Because he's testing you.

454
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,458
I don't know.

455
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,041
Cooper, if a parent comes in

456
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:10,542
and tells you that
their kid stole something,

457
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,083
what do you say?

458
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,250
I would ask
if there had been

459
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:16,875
any other
troubling behavior recently.

460
00:18:16,917 --> 00:18:18,083
Has there been with Mason?

461
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,208
No, but--
then what else
do you ask 'em?

462
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,208
If there had been
any problems at home

463
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,125
that the kid
could be reacting to.

464
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,542
That the case with Mason?

465
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,041
I don't think so, no.

466
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,250
So then what?

467
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:29,875
A kid with no big problems

468
00:18:29,917 --> 00:18:32,333
swipes something from
a toy store, out of the blue.

469
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:33,959
What do you tell
the parents to do?

470
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,250
It's just...

471
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,500
I've never done this before...

472
00:18:38,542 --> 00:18:40,083
Not with my own kid.

473
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,333
It's different.

474
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:46,166
So, Rose, I'm afraid

475
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,000
that, uh...

476
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,750
You have a scarred uterus

477
00:18:50,792 --> 00:18:54,583
and ovarian failure
secondary to pelvic t.B.

478
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:57,083
Tuberculosis?

479
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,709
I'm not sick.

480
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,375
No, you're not. It's,
uh... it's not active.

481
00:19:01,417 --> 00:19:03,041
But if you've spent any time
at all in South America

482
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,166
in the last ten years--

483
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,041
She taught e.S.L.
In Chile after college.

484
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,041
What are you saying?

485
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:09,959
Unfortunately, Rose's body
is incapable

486
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,583
of producing viable eggs

487
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:14,166
or carrying a fetus.

488
00:19:18,667 --> 00:19:21,041
I am so sorry, Rosie.

489
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:24,041
But, um, we can still
have a family, right?

490
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,208
Yes, in fact,

491
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,041
Kendra's tests all came back
perfectly normal.

492
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,417
So if Evan and--and Kendra
were to try to conceive,

493
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:32,041
they might not
even need I.V.F.

494
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,417
What?

495
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,291
What about me?

496
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,709
Rosie,
you'd be the mom, too.

497
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,709
This would be our child.

498
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,333
No, this would be
your child with Evan.

499
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:41,792
It's not the same.

500
00:19:41,834 --> 00:19:44,291
Well, i-in my experience,
once the baby shows up--

501
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,917
no, the whole point of this
was to have a baby together

502
00:19:46,959 --> 00:19:48,750
so that we could all be
a part of the experience.

503
00:19:48,792 --> 00:19:50,000
Dr. Reilly is right.

504
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,417
If the three of you
really want a baby,

505
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,041
no matter
where it comes from--

506
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,333
if I can't be a part of this,

507
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,417
we're not doing it.

508
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,041
Rose, you yourself said,

509
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,875
the three of you
could handle anything.

510
00:20:00,917 --> 00:20:03,125
We are handling it.

511
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:06,041
We're just...

512
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,041
We're just not having
a baby.

513
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,041
I'm saying that,
in a two-party relationship,

514
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,375
both parties have to agree
in order to have the baby.

515
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:21,208
Well, the same rules apply
in the triad.

516
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,041
All decisions are
supposed to be unanimous.

517
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,208
Well, this one
clearly isn't.

518
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,667
And it's not like
one of them can leave.

519
00:20:26,709 --> 00:20:28,041
I mean, they say
they're a family, right?

520
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,041
Well, families don't always
stay together.

521
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,709
Look, the--the truth is

522
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,041
that Kendra and Rose and Evan
are not that different from us.

523
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,667
They want to stay together,
they want to work it out,

524
00:20:35,709 --> 00:20:37,041
and this is just an obstacle.

525
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,625
Well, for most couples,
having or not having a baby,

526
00:20:39,667 --> 00:20:41,208
it's not an obstacle,
it's a deal breaker.

527
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,917
That's because having a baby
is not rational.

528
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:44,041
Sam.

529
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,875
What? I'm not saying
it's irrational.

530
00:20:45,917 --> 00:20:47,041
I'm just saying,
it's instinctive.

531
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,667
You know, it's hormonal.
It's biological.

532
00:20:49,709 --> 00:20:52,041
But wanting one--you either
do or you don't.

533
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,834
Look, you gave them a piece

712
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:42,041
I get that she's upset,
but this is...

713
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:44,917
It's wrong.

714
00:26:44,959 --> 00:26:48,041
She just found out that she
can't be a mom biologically.

715
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:49,834
I mean, that's gonna take
some time.

716
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:52,667
I'm sure part of it is
Rose's concern about the baby.

717
00:26:52,709 --> 00:26:55,041
But don't you think
she's also concerned

718
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:57,500
about what this might do
to the three of you?

719
00:26:57,542 --> 00:26:58,750
In what sense?

720
00:26:58,792 --> 00:27:00,333
Well, that the two of you
might share a bond

721
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:03,333
that she's not,
that she can't be, a part of.

722
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:05,333
No, that would never happen.

723
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:06,333
Ever.

724
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:07,750
It's happening right now.

725
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,041
You two are here
without her.

726
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:10,542
But we're trying
to fix it.

727
00:27:10,583 --> 00:27:13,000
I mean, we want...
To fix it.

728
00:27:13,041 --> 00:27:14,375
Okay.

729
00:27:14,417 --> 00:27:16,125
Are you willing
to compromise?

730
00:27:17,417 --> 00:27:19,583
If there was some way
we could reassure Rose,

731
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:24,166
make her understand that we're
doing this for the three of us.

732
00:27:24,208 --> 00:27:26,583
You're the one
who told me,

733
00:27:26,625 --> 00:27:29,250
this relationship works
because of the rules.

734
00:27:29,291 --> 00:27:32,375
All decisions
have to be unanimous.

735
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:37,917
No, Amelia started it.
She came on to me.

736
00:27:37,959 --> 00:27:39,750
Aim for the target,
Sheldon.

737
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:41,834
And then just when I started
feeling something...

738
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:43,709
Enter Ryan.

739
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,500
Remember to use
your left hand

740
00:27:45,542 --> 00:27:47,625
to steady your right.

741
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:48,834
And I feel sorry for her.

742
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,709
I mean, she loved him,
and he died.

743
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,417
And I know she feels bad
about humiliating me.

744
00:27:53,458 --> 00:27:55,709
I-I... I don't know. I...
Why can't I forgive her?

745
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:58,041
Pull the trigger, Sheldon.

746
00:27:58,083 --> 00:27:59,125

747
00:27:59,166 --> 00:28:01,041

749
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:06,500
Holy hell, that felt good.

750
00:28:06,542 --> 00:28:07,834
Yep.

751
00:28:07,875 --> 00:28:09,333
Shoot the target,
let it all out there,

752
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:11,333
'cause I can pretty well
promise you,

753
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:13,000
Amelia's in no shape

754
00:28:13,041 --> 00:28:16,041
to take care of a single one
of your feelings right now.

755
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:18,125
I know you love her,
Sheldon.

756
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:22,041
Love her enough
to leave her alone.

757
00:28:22,083 --> 00:28:23,375
Take aim.

Hey.

768
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:54,417
Morning.

769
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:56,041
What happened
to your hand?

770
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:58,917
Ah, I strained it
at the shooting range.

771
00:28:58,959 --> 00:29:00,750
The shooting range,
really?

772
00:29:00,792 --> 00:29:02,083
It might be
my new hobby.

773
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:05,375
That...
Sounds kind of fun.

774
00:29:05,417 --> 00:29:08,041
Could I...
Could I go sometime?

775
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:10,500
Uh, no.

776
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:12,709
I mean, just, uh...

777
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,083
Not any time really soon.

778
00:29:15,125 --> 00:29:16,750
You understand?

779
00:29:17,959 --> 00:29:19,250
I understand.

780
00:29:25,375 --> 00:29:27,834
There's nothing that can
be done to...

781
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:29,875
Fix me?

782
00:29:29,917 --> 00:29:31,875
Rose, you--
you aren't broken.

783
00:29:31,917 --> 00:29:33,750
I know it feels that way,

784
00:29:33,792 --> 00:29:35,834
but... there are
so many women

785
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:38,041
who have come to me,
unable to conceive,

786
00:29:38,083 --> 00:29:42,959
and... yet we still find
a way to make them mothers.

787
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,417
Are you a father?

788
00:29:44,458 --> 00:29:46,750
Yes, I am,
not biologically,

789
00:29:46,792 --> 00:29:48,625
but regardless,
the love I feel--

790
00:29:48,667 --> 00:29:51,291
I don't want to lose them.

791
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,041
What if a baby
changes everything?

792
00:29:55,083 --> 00:29:57,333
If the love is real,

793
00:29:57,375 --> 00:29:59,125
it can withstand anything.

794
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:01,333
Do you really believe that?

795
00:30:03,792 --> 00:30:05,000
No.

796
00:30:07,083 --> 00:30:08,542
No, I...

797
00:30:10,083 --> 00:30:13,291
I think love
is a powerful force.

798
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:17,166
It puts up a hell of a fight,
but, uh...

799
00:30:17,208 --> 00:30:20,667
Sometimes life rises up
and wins.

800
00:30:20,709 --> 00:30:23,291
That's what I'm afraid of...

801
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:26,041
That me being infertile...

802
00:30:26,083 --> 00:30:29,667
That's gonna be
life winning.

803
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:33,041
So do you think
you can finish early

804
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:35,041
so we can go to the pier?

805
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,333
Uh, we're not going
to the pier today.

806
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:38,625
Really?

807
00:30:38,667 --> 00:30:40,041
Really.

808
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:43,166
I need to talk to you,
so...

809
00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:49,291
I saw you steal
that pack of cards

810
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:51,625
from the toy store.
But I d--

811
00:30:51,667 --> 00:30:53,625
don't even start to tell me
that you didn't,

812
00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:56,542
because... I saw you.

813
00:30:58,083 --> 00:30:59,041
I want to call my mom.

814
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:00,333
Just sit down

815
00:31:00,375 --> 00:31:02,041
and you're gonna
listen to me, okay?

816
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:03,125
Says who?

817
00:31:03,166 --> 00:31:04,750
Says me.
I'm your father.

818
00:31:04,792 --> 00:31:06,208
No.

819
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:09,500
You're just the guy
who got my mom pregnant.

820
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:13,041
Okay,
here's what happens next--

821
00:31:13,083 --> 00:31:14,875
tomorrow after school,
I'm gonna pick you up,

822
00:31:14,917 --> 00:31:16,667
I'm gonna take you
to the toy store,

823
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:17,875
and you're gonna apologize
to the owner.

824
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:19,041
I am not gonna--

825
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:20,250
you're gonna apologize
to the owner.

826
00:31:20,291 --> 00:31:22,041
Then I'm gonna take you home.

827
00:31:22,083 --> 00:31:24,041
You're gonna go to your room
and do your homework.

828
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:27,667
And you're gonna stay in there
till it's time to go to bed,

829
00:31:27,709 --> 00:31:30,875
and it's gonna be like that
for a week.

830
00:31:30,917 --> 00:31:33,500
You think my mom's
gonna go along with this?

831
00:31:33,542 --> 00:31:35,917
I know she will.

832
00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:38,291
But... what about
the weekend?

833
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:40,041
Are we still gonna go
to the movies?

834
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:42,000
No, the movies are out.

835
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:47,000
But... am I even
gonna see you?

836
00:31:48,667 --> 00:31:50,041
Of course.

837
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:53,417
I am never going away.

838
00:31:55,125 --> 00:31:56,959
Okay?

839
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:08,333
I want a baby.

840
00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:12,333
Just... not this way.

841
00:32:13,667 --> 00:32:15,041
But I love you guys

842
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:16,959
so I guess I'll do it.

843
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,041
You two can make our baby,

844
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:21,667
and I will
just have to trust us.

845
00:32:21,709 --> 00:32:23,041
Thank you, Rose.

846
00:32:23,083 --> 00:32:25,458
Thank you.

847
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,041
No.

848
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:30,625
I can't do that.

849
00:32:30,667 --> 00:32:32,208
I really want a baby, too,

850
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,917
but the reason we work
is the rules.

851
00:32:33,959 --> 00:32:35,083
We need rules.

852
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:37,083
We need unanimous
or someone's gonna get hurt,

853
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:39,291
and we can't have that happen.

854
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:42,125
So we can use a surrogate

855
00:32:42,166 --> 00:32:44,000
or adopt
or not have a baby at all,

856
00:32:44,041 --> 00:32:46,500
but... given the choice,
I choose you.

857
00:32:46,542 --> 00:32:47,792
I choose the three of us.

858
00:32:47,834 --> 00:32:50,166
This is crazy.
This isn't some little thing.

859
00:32:50,208 --> 00:32:53,333
This is... not trivial.

860
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:55,000
I want a child...

861
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:56,917
My child.

862
00:32:56,959 --> 00:32:58,125
Evan...

863
00:32:58,166 --> 00:33:00,000
I love you, both of you,

864
00:33:00,041 --> 00:33:02,041
but...

865
00:33:03,834 --> 00:33:06,333
I'm not sure
I can choose you.

866
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:22,417
Hi.

867
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:23,875
Hey.

868
00:33:25,542 --> 00:33:27,125
How are you?

869
00:33:27,166 --> 00:33:29,417
Okay.

870
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:33,166
I didn't want to hold her,

871
00:33:33,208 --> 00:33:35,208
but then I did, and...

872
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:40,375
Do you want to hold her?

873
00:33:43,458 --> 00:33:44,875
Yes.

874
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,000
Oh.

875
00:33:50,041 --> 00:33:51,041
Ahh.

876
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:52,959
Oh.

877
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,041
Oh, hi, little girl.

878
00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:59,041
Hello, baby girl.

879
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:01,041
Addison.

880
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:03,417
Yes.

881
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:06,458
Meeting you...
Has been incredible.

882
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,333
Oh, thank you.

883
00:34:08,375 --> 00:34:11,458
For me, too.

884
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,083
This is hard.

885
00:34:16,041 --> 00:34:18,792
I can't even imagine.

886
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,083
Oh. What?

887
00:34:22,125 --> 00:34:24,375
It's crazy.

888
00:34:24,417 --> 00:34:27,291
I was so sure
you were the perfect fit

889
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:30,083
to mother my child.

890
00:34:30,125 --> 00:34:32,041
And what you did for me

891
