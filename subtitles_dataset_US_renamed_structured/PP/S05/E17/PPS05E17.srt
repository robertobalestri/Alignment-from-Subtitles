00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:08,500
I had this friend
in college--Mia.

3
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:09,750
And the first time I met her,

4
00:00:09,792 --> 00:00:10,709
I remember she was telling me
about this guy--

5
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,041
Robert something.

6
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:14,166
And she described him
as "more old-man good-looking

7
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:15,792
than college good-looking."

8
00:00:15,834 --> 00:00:17,750
And she said
how it would be a waste

9
00:00:17,792 --> 00:00:19,959
to date somebody like that
while still in college.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,208
But he was crazy about her
and he kept asking her out,

11
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,208
and she kept saying no--
again and again.

12
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,041
And then...

13
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:28,041
Junior year, during finals,
I was in the library,

14
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:30,792
and I saw them together
in the stacks making out.

15
00:00:30,834 --> 00:00:33,125
I mean, like,
seriously making out.

16
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:36,041
And I kept thinking,
how did that happen?

♪♪♪

18
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:43,959
Sorry, dad.
Just one more minute.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,625
It's your birthday, ange.
Take five more minutes.

20
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,542
So there's...

21
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:52,000
Something
I wanted to tell you.

22
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:53,417
Let me guess.

23
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:56,000
You're dropping bio and all
of your pre-med classes?

24
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:58,875
I was planning on sneaking
that in after dinner.

25
00:00:58,917 --> 00:01:00,041
Ouch.

26
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:02,041
Just kidding.
I like being pre med.

27
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:03,166
Kind of.

28
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:05,166
Anyway...

29
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:08,625
The thing is...
I did it.

30
00:01:08,667 --> 00:01:10,500
I had sex
for the first time.

31
00:01:10,542 --> 00:01:11,834
What?
I--

32
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:13,375
no, wait. Don't--don't--
don't say that again.

33
00:01:13,417 --> 00:01:14,834
I mean, I might be in love

34
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:16,834
so we had sex,
and it was--

35
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:18,834
oh, no. No, i--
I don't--

36
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:21,041
I don't really want to know
what it was like.

37
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:22,500
I don't want to know
anything about it.

38
00:01:22,542 --> 00:01:23,709
You're still 8
and you're putting on

39
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,041
your mother's makeup
for the first time.

40
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:26,709
I'm not 8,
and he's really nice.

41
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,417
And his name is--

42
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:29,709
I mean, you realize,
you tell me his name,

43
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,041
I'm gonna have to
hunt him down--
dad.

44
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:32,500
I'm sorry.

45
00:01:32,542 --> 00:01:33,875
I'm sorry.

46
00:01:33,917 --> 00:01:35,250
Wow.

47
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:37,125
I mean, this is a...

48
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:38,667
This is
a little weird for me.

49
00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:39,750
You're...

50
00:01:39,792 --> 00:01:41,709
You're my baby girl.

51
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,709
I know, but...

52
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,709
I kind of

53
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,959
I don't know,
I wanted to tell you

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,041
because I'm so happy.

55
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:53,291
And I figured that is
something you'd want to hear.

56
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:55,625
Well, I do, but I...

57
00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:59,709
I do, and i'm--
I'm glad you told me.

58
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:04,000
It's nice,

59
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:07,041
feeling like this.

60
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:08,875
Yeah, it--it is.

61
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:12,166
Oh, my god.

62
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:13,917
Do you have someone?

63
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:16,208
Let's go eat.
Come on.

64
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,041
Hey.

65
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:28,166
How long
have I been sleeping?

66
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:29,667
Since last night.

67
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:31,750
How do you feel?

68
00:02:31,792 --> 00:02:33,959
Groggy.

69
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,333
Okay, I guess.

70
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:37,834
I'll be right outside
if either of you needs me,

71
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:39,417
okay?

72
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,709
Oh, god. Sam...
Oh.

73
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,166
Your head.

74
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:53,709
Don't worry about it.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

75
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,583
No, no, no,
I-I broke your door.

76
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:57,041
Well, I was worried
about you,

77
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,041
and the door,
it wasn't your fault.

78
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:01,625
No, even if
I don't mean to do...
Shh.

79
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:04,125
The stuff I do, I still--
it still happens.
Stop it. S--Corinne.

80
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:06,208
Stop. Stop. Stop it.
I still do it.

81
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,875
Stop.

82
00:03:07,917 --> 00:03:09,792
We are in this together.

83
00:03:09,834 --> 00:03:11,250
Okay?

84
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,041
Now as long
as you keep trying--

85
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,834
no, I will. I promise.
But just--

86
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:15,750
I know. I know.

87
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:18,667
I promise.

88
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:23,250
Please.

89
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:24,959
Don't give up on me.

90
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,792
You know,
because without you--

91
00:03:26,834 --> 00:03:30,041
hey, I'm not going anywhere.

92
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:32,542
Okay. Okay.

93
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,542
Okay, look, I think she needs
a proper facility.

94
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:35,792
All right.
Well, I'm a doctor.

95
00:03:35,834 --> 00:03:36,750
All right?
I can handle all that.

96
00:03:36,792 --> 00:03:38,750
It's not a one-man job.
Okay?

97
00:03:38,792 --> 00:03:41,250
She's gonna require strict
supervision around the clock,

98
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:43,625
daily therapy,
constant monitoring till we find

99
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:44,875
a drug cocktail
to keep her stabilized.

100
00:03:44,917 --> 00:03:45,875
Sheldon,
I can do all of that.

101
00:03:45,917 --> 00:03:47,417
Sam, it can be
a huge challenge

102
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:48,875
to get someone
in Corinne's condition

103
00:03:48,917 --> 00:03:50,250
just to take her meds.

104
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:53,041
You can't give up
your entire life to do this,

105
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:55,000
even if you tried--

106
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,041
she's my sister!

107
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,417
Then be her brother,

108
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,792
not her warden.

109
00:03:59,834 --> 00:04:02,250
You gotta trust me on this.

110
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:06,709
Dr. Wilder, we need you.

111
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,041
Is that Scott?
What the hell happened?

112
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,417
It was a domestic.

113
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,875
Husband went crazy
on his wife.

114
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,166
We thought he was gone.

115
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:13,917
Trauma panel. C-spine,
chest and pelvis.

116
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:15,750
He came back with some friends.
They jumped us.

117
00:04:15,792 --> 00:04:17,667
Scott got the worst of it.
Okay, on my count.

118
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:19,417
Honestly, I'm fine.
One, two, three.

119
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:22,500
Oh! Son of a bitch! Ohh!

120
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:23,750
Okay, his shoulder
is dislocated.

121
00:04:23,792 --> 00:04:25,125
5 of morphine, I.V. Push.

122
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,041
He took a few blows
to the ribs

123
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,041
and got kicked in the head.

124
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,959
Call neuro.
We need a brain C.T.

125
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,917
Violet.

126
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:33,750
He's been asking for her.
Should I...

127
00:04:33,792 --> 00:04:35,834
Should someone call
Dr. Turner?

128
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:45,875
I'll do it.

129
00:04:45,917 --> 00:04:51,083
I'll do it.

130
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,875
Hey.

131
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,083
What are you doing here
so late?

132
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,792
Catching up
on patient files.

133
00:04:55,834 --> 00:04:57,792
You?

134
00:04:57,834 --> 00:05:00,166
I checked on Corinne.

135
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,125
You're hovering.
It's weirding me out.

136
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,375
So any...

137
00:05:15,417 --> 00:05:18,000
Any decision?

138
00:05:20,417 --> 00:05:21,917
I think I want

139
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:23,750
mint tea
instead of chamomile.

140
00:05:23,792 --> 00:05:26,125
Yeah, I meant,
you know, the baby.

141
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,917
What baby?

142
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,125
I know this is hard,

143
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,166
but you're well into
your second trimester.

144
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:32,917
Time is running out

145
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,959
if you decide you want to...

146
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,834
I mean, you know, if--
if you need to...

147
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,792
Terminate.

148
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,625
You could keep the baby.

149
00:05:41,667 --> 00:05:43,041
I'm two seconds sober.

150
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,125
I'm not exactly mother
of the year material.

151
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:47,041
What about adoption?

152
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,041
Because crack babies
are in such high demand.

153
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,959
I'm sorry none of the choices
are without pain.

154
00:05:57,417 --> 00:05:59,041
It's time.

155
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:02,583
You know, you...
You need to choose.

156
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,041
Oh, my.

157
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:13,250
Spinning, spinning,
spinning.

158
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,542
Oh, right hand yellow.

159
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,792
Oh.
Oh, okay.

160
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:17,000
Oh, great. Good thing
I do yoga.

161
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:19,041
No, my body
does not move that way.

162
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,375
Mom, you should come play.

163
00:06:20,417 --> 00:06:22,959
Oh, but your mom
is the best spinner.

164
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,041
That's right.
I am the best.

165
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,000
Come on, Coop.
Right hand yellow.

166
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,041
Hey!
That was just sad.

167
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,375
Could we play Wii
or something now?

168
00:06:30,417 --> 00:06:32,291
Can we play
Wii or something...

169
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,375
Okay. I will reign supreme.

170
00:06:34,417 --> 00:06:36,041
Spin it.

171
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,625
Spinning.

172
00:06:42,542 --> 00:06:44,417
What happened?

173
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:45,917
He got himself between
a battered wife

174
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,041
and a drunk husband.

175
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,041
Husband came out
on top, though, so...

176
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,041
Don't say that.
This isn't funny.

177
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,041
Ow!
That's my shoulder.

178
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,667
It's dislocated.
Can you do something?

179
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:56,041
I'm gonna try to reduce it
before the morphine wears off.

180
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,250
You might want
to wait outside.

181
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,500
Why?

182
00:06:58,542 --> 00:07:00,041
It's not gonna be
very pretty.

183
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,333
I've seen worse things

184
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,125
than a shoulder being slid
back into its socket.

185
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,333
Let--let me help.

186
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:06,041
Mm.

187
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,041
Okay.

188
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,208
I'm gonna do
the kocher maneuver.

189
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,500
Do you remember
how to do it?

190
00:07:09,542 --> 00:07:11,291
Of course.

191
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,750
Okay.

192
00:07:13,792 --> 00:07:15,667
Come right in here.

193
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:17,041
Put your hands
on his shoulder.

194
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,083
Ow.

195
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,208
When I say,

196
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,041
you push down hard.

197
00:07:24,542 --> 00:07:26,291
Ah.
Ready?

198
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,041
Ah. Ah.
Okay, now.

199
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,041
Aah! Aah!
It's not working.

200
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,041
Push harder.
Pete, I can't.
It's not working.

201
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,542
You're not
pressing hard enough.

202
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,458
I need some help here.
Violet, we are almost there.

203
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,041
We can't stop now.
Hey, Violet.

204
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,083
Hey, hey, look at me.
Look at me, you can do this.

205
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,750
You gotta trust me. Now press
down as hard as you can.

206
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:44,250
Go.

207
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:45,792
Aah! Ah!

208
00:07:45,834 --> 00:07:47,041
Oh, oh, ooh!

209
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,083
Okay.

210
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,041
Ah. Ah.

211
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,750
You okay?
I'm fine.

212
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:52,041
Yeah, that just,
you know, wasn't...
Thank you.

213
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:55,583
Um... you know,
how I remembered it.

214
00:07:57,083 --> 00:08:00,083
All right. Let me get a nurse
to immobilize that.

215
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,291
Thank you.

216
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,250
You know, you're gonna
run out of questions

217
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:06,291
to ask me about school.

218
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:07,667
And since
we already covered Ethan,

219
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:08,959
whose last name
will remain unknown

220
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,041
for security reasons...

221
00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:13,125
Sooner or later, we're gonna
get around to you.

222
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,583
What do you want to know?

223
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,500
Are you happy?

224
00:08:16,542 --> 00:08:18,333
Um, I'm headed there.

225
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:22,125
I-I like the practice.
The people are great.

226
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,417
Good, smart docs.

227
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,000
But?

228
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:27,417
Well, i'm--
I'm the new guy, right?

229
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:28,625
I mean, I've been there
for a while.

230
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:30,083
I'm starting to fit in,

231
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:33,083
but I don't know, I'm kind of
the old new guy now.

232
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,166
So who's the woman?

233
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,041
I didn't, uh, I didn't
say anything about a woman.

234
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,375
You didn't have to.

235
00:08:39,417 --> 00:08:40,583
Ange.

236
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,417
Jake.

237
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,792
It's, uh...

238
00:08:44,834 --> 00:08:47,458
It's complicated.

239
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,041
But you like complicated.

240
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,417
You hung around
with my mother...

241
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:52,667
Who was a drug addict

242
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:54,333
and had
an 8-year-old daughter.

243
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,625
Come on.

244
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,667
Her name is Addison.

245
00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:00,834
And she's beautiful
and brilliant

246
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:03,458
and frustrating.

247
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,583
You know when someone is,
um, is confused, they--

248
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:09,834
they--they start
sending out mixed signals?

249
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,959
She's doing that?

250
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,041
I think I am.

251
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:19,709
You know, mom would
want you to be happy.

252
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,333
She would.

253
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,458
What are you doing?

254
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,583
I want you to take me home.

255
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:34,166
Corinne, we're not there yet.

256
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,625
Will you take me home?

257
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:38,458
All right, look...

258
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,458
I want you to get better.

259
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,500
That won't happen
in this place.

260
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:45,709
You took me out of jail,

261
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,834
and it's like I'm a prisoner
all over again.

262
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,333
You know, I'm afraid
if I don't smile,

263
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,792
they'll sedate me.

264
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,625
I'm not a person here,

265
00:09:56,667 --> 00:09:58,667
not human.

266
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:01,250
I don't want
to do this anymore.

267
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:04,959
Just... please just
get me outta here.

268
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,125
Okay.

269
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,458
Okay.

270
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,291
No, it's just a little early.

271
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,750
You usually don't pop by.
Is everything okay?

272
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:22,333
What are you doing
with that?

273
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,125
Oh, garbage disposal broke.

274
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,667
And you're fixing it, huh?

275
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:28,000
I would've thought
that you had someone to--

276
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,583
come on. I perform lifesaving
surgeries on babies in the womb.

277
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:33,750
I can certainly
fix my own sink.

278
00:10:33,792 --> 00:10:36,291
And the handyman was backed up
for three days, so...

279
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,041
Ah.
Okay. What's going on?

280
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,583
I went to the hospital
this morning to visit Corinne,

281
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:43,166
and Sam had checked her out.

282
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,291
I told him it was a mistake.

283
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,291
You don't think that Corinne
can get better at home?

284
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,291
I don't know how much better
she can get at all.

285
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,583
And even with the best meds,

286
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,583
Corinne will struggle
with chronic mental illness,

287
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,917
and it's gonna be difficult
just to...

288
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,333
Just to keep her stable.

289
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:57,792
Sam doesn't want
to hear all that.

290
00:10:57,834 --> 00:10:59,333
Well, it's his sister,

291
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,917
and we do have
an obligation to family.

292
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:03,041
To that extent
that we can help,

293
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,709
but sometimes
the help that families offer

294
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,792
can prevent the patient
from getting proper oversight

295
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:08,750
that he really needs, and...

296
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:12,000
Corinne went through
a glass door.

297
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:14,917
What if it's fire
next time?

298
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,750
You want me to talk to him?
And what would you say?

299
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:18,041
Well, you made
a logical appeal.

300
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,750
I would make
an emotional appeal.

301
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:20,959
I think that makes sense.

302
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,792
Okay.

303
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,458
Do you know anything
about sinks?

304
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,750
No.

305
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:35,333
That's gonna leave a scar?

306
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,333
Well, I'm gonna do
the best I can,

307
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,583
but, uh... yeah.

308
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:40,959
At least you'll have
some bragging rights

309
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,750
with the other paramedics.

310
00:11:42,792 --> 00:11:44,667
Just not with Violet.
How so?

311
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:47,625
I get the feeling
she's not impressed.

312
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:48,792
Ah, she's just scared.

313
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:50,834
It's kinda like a... a mother

314
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,750
scolding her kid for running out
in the street without looking.

315
00:11:53,792 --> 00:11:55,041
She's not really angry.

316
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:59,583
She's just terrified something
much worse coulda happened.

317
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:04,166
I'm gonna try not to read
into that whole child analogy.

318
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:05,625
Hey, look,

319
00:12:05,667 --> 00:12:08,375
believe it or not,
I'm happy for you and Violet.

320
00:12:08,417 --> 00:12:09,834
I do find that
hard to believe.

321
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,625
We've reached a place
in our friendship,

322
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:13,500
in our coparenting.

323
00:12:13,542 --> 00:12:15,917
She's got you now,
and I'm dating someone, so...

324
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:17,792
Hi.

325
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:20,583
What happened?

326
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:24,250
He passed out.
B.P. Is 90 over 50.

327
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,500
His abdomen's rigid.
He's bleeding into his belly.

328
00:12:26,542 --> 00:12:28,041
Cross and match times four.
Get in touch with the O.R.

329
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,625
I'm gonna go with you.

330
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:31,041
No, you stay here.

331
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,083
I'll come get you and soon
as I know what's going on.

332
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,667
Hey.

333
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:40,625
Oh, hey.

334
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:41,709
What are you doing?

335
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,041
Uh, oh, Corinne's
taking a bath, so...

336
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,041
I just wanted to make sure
she's okay.

337
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,625
Oh.

338
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:49,041
I was just...

339
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,041
Making sure
that you're okay.

340
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,041
Oh, I'm fine.

341
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,417
Yeah? And Corinne?

342
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,250
She's fine. She's fine.

343
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:59,041
You know, it's--
it's an adjustment.

344
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:02,709
But we're--
we're figuring it out.

345
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,041
Corinne?

346
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,750
I'm still here, Sam.

347
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,041
I can't even imagine how...

348
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,250
Painful this must be
for you.

349
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,250
Yeah.

350
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:21,333
You could hire someone
to help,

351
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,333
find somewhere
for her to stay

352
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,250
where she can get
the care she needs.

353
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,333
Come on, Addison.

354
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:30,000
You know I'm not gonna do
anything like that.

355
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,792
I know.

356
00:13:33,834 --> 00:13:36,709
That's why I'm worried.

357
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:42,291
I appreciate it.
I really do.

358
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:45,041
I'm gonna be fine.

359
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,875
Really.

360
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,834
This is Ryan's baby.

361
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:02,542
I can't abort
Ryan's baby.

362
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:06,291
And... I can't give away
Ryan's baby.

363
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,041
So you're having
Ryan's baby?

364
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,959
Yeah.

365
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,208
I'm having Ryan's baby.

366
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,333
How about that?

367
00:14:20,834 --> 00:14:22,041
Hey.

368
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,041
Morning.

369
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:26,250
How are you?

370
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,208
What?

371
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,208
You really want to make
a baby with me?

372
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,208
You're not ready.

373
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:34,041
I mean, I-I think
she's still in shock. She--

374
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,041
who?
Oh, Violet.

375
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,750
Scott was badly beaten
on a run last night.

376
00:14:37,792 --> 00:14:39,041
Is he okay?

377
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,417
He's in surgery.
Violet's at the hospital.

378
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:41,750
And it was Pete
that was working on him.

379
00:14:41,792 --> 00:14:43,250
Oh, that's awkward.

380
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:44,542
I should go see her.

381
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,041
What?

382
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,000
Nothing.

383
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:51,583
Hey, Sam.
Uh, how's Corinne doing?

384
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,041
She's all right.
Thanks.

385
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,500
Sam.
Yeah.

386
00:14:54,542 --> 00:14:55,792
If you need anything--

387
00:14:55,834 --> 00:14:58,041
thank you. We're okay.

388
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,458
Mason, you are not supposed
to use your cell phone

389
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,917
from school.

390
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,000
- Are Sam and Corinne okay?
- I tried.

391
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:06,166
I'm sure you did.

392
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,917
Well, is it time
for another intervention?

393
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:09,834
Wait. Slow down.
I can't understand you.
Too soon?

394
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,667
Okay, just stay put.
We will be right there.

395
00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:14,041
I love you.

396
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,041
It's Erica.
There's something wrong.

397
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,041
Oh, it's--
oh, it hurts.

398
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:29,834
Ah.
What the hell is this?

399
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,333
Mase.
Dad.

400
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:32,625
It's okay.
We're here. We're here.

401
00:15:32,667 --> 00:15:34,041
What's going on?

402
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,041
She's complaining of crampy
abdominal pain with distension.

403
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,208
Well, that can't be
secondary to neurosurgery,

404
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,417
not in her abdomen.

405
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,041
Erica, any headaches,
weakness?

406
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,542
No, no. My stomach.

407
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,041
I ordered
an abdominal C.T.

408
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:45,041
Oh, I think I'm gonna...

409
00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:50,041
Is that blood?

410
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,291
Cooper, take him away.
Ohh!

411
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,041
I don't want to go.

412
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,125
We'll bring you back after
the doctors help your mom, okay?

413
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,041
Now come on, Mason.
Come on.
I love you, mommy.

414
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,333
I love you.

415
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,041
How come you're not eating?

416
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,500
I'm not hungry.

417
00:16:03,542 --> 00:16:04,750
Come on, Corinne.

418
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:06,333
I can't make myself hungry.

419
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,041
Look...

420
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,041
If we're gonna do this,

421
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,041
there have to be rules,
right?

422
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,333
You gotta get
eight hours of sleep,

423
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,041
you gotta eat properly,

424
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,000
take your meds.

425
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,542
Yeah, okay, okay.

426
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:19,000
Thank you.

427
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,375
There you go.

428
00:16:34,667 --> 00:16:36,834
Open your mouth.

429
00:16:38,417 --> 00:16:40,750
Come on.
Open up. I can't see.

430
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,792
All right.

431
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,500
If I wanted
to be humiliated,

432
00:16:46,542 --> 00:16:47,709
I could've stayed
in the hospital.

433
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,000
Oh, come on, Corinne.

434
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,166
I don't want to do that.

435
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:51,583
You know that's not
what I'm doing, okay?

436
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,875
Now eat your food.

437
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,041
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

438
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,166
All right?
I'm just trying to--

439
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:01,333
it's not that.

440
00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:05,166
Well, then what is it?

441
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:12,041
I don't want to be here.

442
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:14,250
Okay, well, you said you wanted
to come back home, so--

443
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:17,041
no, I don't mean here
in your home.

444
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:22,041
I mean here on earth,
alive.

445
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,208
And don't worry.

446
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,667
I don't have the courage
to kill myself.

447
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:27,667
It could be worse
on the other side.

448
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:31,834
I'd probably just...
Screw it up

449
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:35,834
and become a quadriplegic
or so--

450
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:38,834
the worst place for me,
the scariest place for me,

451
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,834
is in my mind,
and that's all I'd have left.

452
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:45,041
So I'm not gonna do it,
but...

453
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:47,208
I don't want to be here.

454
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:54,000
Okay.

455
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,000
I know it may seem
like it,

456
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:59,417
but you're not gonna
feel this way forever.

457
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:06,041
Okay?

458
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:09,291
Yeah,
I'm sure you're right.

459
00:18:10,709 --> 00:18:12,750
All right.

460
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:18,083
I just saw Pete.

461
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,125
Scott had a delayed rupture of
his spleen due to the trauma,

462
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,875
and they had to remove it.

463
00:18:21,917 --> 00:18:23,250
Is he gonna be okay?

464
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:24,500
He's doing fine.

465
00:18:24,542 --> 00:18:25,709
Uh, they're just
finishing up now.

466
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,083
They'll move him to recovery.

467
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,834
Well, that's good.

468
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,041
Have you talked to Cooper?

469
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,291
No. Why?

470
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:32,875
Erica's in the E.R.

471
00:18:32,917 --> 00:18:34,041
What happened?

472
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:36,291
She collapsed.
Mason called Cooper.

473
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,542
It's... it's bad.

474
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,291
Okay. Well, where is he?
I'll go see him.

475
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:40,542
Yeah, Cooper's with Mason
right now.

476
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:41,834
I'd--I'd give it
a little while.

477
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:42,750
Okay.

478
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,875
Are you gonna be okay?

479
00:18:49,917 --> 00:18:53,291
Well, my boyfriend
or whatever

480
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:56,583
who--who I care about
was rushed into the E.R.

481
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,709
And was treated by my husband,
who I also care about.

482
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,792
And he's trying to decide
if our marriage is worth saving.

483
00:19:00,834 --> 00:19:03,709
And now my best friend's son's
mother is back in the hospital.

484
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,458
So... not okay.

485
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,667
Not so much.

486
00:19:07,709 --> 00:19:09,208
Not so much.

487
00:19:13,542 --> 00:19:15,709
You said my mom was okay.

488
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,917
I thought she was,
and she still might be.

489
00:19:17,959 --> 00:19:19,750
She threw up blood.
And that's not good,

490
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:21,750
but Amelia and Pete
and Charlotte,

491
00:19:21,792 --> 00:19:24,041
they're gonna figure it out.

492
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,750
Are you lying to me?

493
00:19:25,792 --> 00:19:27,166
No.

494
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,208
Mason, no, I promise.

495
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,500
Hey, look at me.

496
00:19:32,542 --> 00:19:35,583
I don't know what's going on
with your mom.

497
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,083
But if she's sick again,

498
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,750
you have to tell me
this time.

499
00:19:41,792 --> 00:19:43,000
I promise.

500
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:43,959
Swear.

501
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I swear. I will tell you
whatever I know.

502
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:57,000
Hey.

503
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,041
Just wanted to check
and see if you were okay.

504
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,542
He's still sleeping.

505
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,458
I'm fine.

506
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,875
How's Erica?

507
00:20:03,917 --> 00:20:06,041
She's stable.
Amelia's running some scans.

508
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,208
Where's Cooper?
Is he still with Mason?

509
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,542
Yeah. It's rough.

510
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,125
I just...
I keep thinking,

511
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:13,375
if it was one of us...

512
00:20:13,417 --> 00:20:14,875
I know. I called the nanny.

513
00:20:14,917 --> 00:20:16,041
I had her put Lucas
on the phone twice already.

514
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,542
I know.

515
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,041
I called earlier, but he'd
already gone down for a nap.

516
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,250
Yeah, well, don't worry.

517
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,875
Um, I told him
that I was with you.

518
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:24,625
Thank you.

519
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:29,041
Violet.

520
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:31,083
Hey.

521
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,041
Hey.

522
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,291
How you feelin'?

523
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,041
Awful.

524
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,500
Ah. Sore.

525
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,583
Thank you.

526
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:45,041
Oh, come on.
No problem.

527
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,041
So, uh...

528
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,333
I will catch up
with you guys later.

529
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,667
It's a beautiful day out.

530
00:21:02,709 --> 00:21:05,709
Want to get some fresh air,
go for a walk?

531
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,917
Wait. Hold up.

532
00:21:09,959 --> 00:21:10,875
No, I'll go alone.

533
00:21:10,917 --> 00:21:12,709
No, I'll come with you.

534
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,125
Sam, I'll walk straight out
to the beach.

535
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,041
You'll be able to see me.

536
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:20,041
If I put rocks in my pockets
and start to run into the ocean,

537
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,125
you'll notice.

538
00:21:28,792 --> 00:21:30,041
Sam.

539
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,041
Hey.

540
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:34,041
Were you--were you gonna
go with your sister?

541
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:36,417
Uh, no.

542
00:21:38,959 --> 00:21:40,458
What are you doing?

543
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,000
She said she'd rather
be dead.

544
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:44,458
So I don't know if she
really feels like that

545
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,041
or if it's some kind of
cry for help

546
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:47,166
but I just feel like
I need to--

547
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:48,875
suicide-proof the house?

548
00:21:48,917 --> 00:21:50,041
Sam...

549
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,500
You can't do this.

550
00:21:52,542 --> 00:21:54,959
You cannot watch her
every second.

551
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,291
It's too much.

552
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:57,917
We've been through this.

553
00:21:57,959 --> 00:21:59,667
No, no, you've put me off.
Listen to me.

554
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:02,458
I get wanting to do anything
you can for your family.

555
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,041
I get it.

556
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:05,417
You know, you're doing this
because you feel a sense of--

557
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:06,917
of responsibility
and guilt.

558
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:09,375
But I am telling you,
no matter how hard you try,

559
00:22:09,417 --> 00:22:11,834
you won't bring Corinne up.
She'll bring you down.

560
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:14,375
And that makes me scared
for you.

561
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:16,500
Well...

562
00:22:16,542 --> 00:22:17,959
I made a promise to my sister

563
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,959
that I'd never give up
on her.

564
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,208
So...

565
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,166
I won't.

566
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,417
Can you just take these,
please?

567
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:44,250
This is it, huh?

568
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:47,125
The glio
has metastasized.

569
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,625
Another tumor.

570
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:51,834
Not just one.
It's in your liver,

571
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:53,125
your g.I. Tract,

572
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:54,667
and it's encroaching
on your spinal column.

573
00:22:57,291 --> 00:22:58,750
How long?

574
00:22:58,792 --> 00:23:00,750
That depends
on a number of factors--

575
00:23:00,792 --> 00:23:01,959
how long?

576
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,667
Given the bleeding,
maybe a week.

577
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,125
What do I have
to look forward to?

578
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:12,041
Paralysis in your legs.

579
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:14,291
Your bowels will stop working.

580
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:15,792
Constant pain.

581
00:23:15,834 --> 00:23:17,166
He can't see this.

582
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:20,041
Erica, Mason will want to be
around you as much as possible.

583
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:22,041
My son
will not watch me

584
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:23,709
become pathetic and useless.

585
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:27,583
He will not watch

586
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:29,667
because that...

587
00:23:30,917 --> 00:23:33,458
I love him too much to see
that look on his face.

588
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:39,667
I can't do that to him.

589
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:42,041
Do you understand?

590
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:45,041
Do you understand?

591
00:23:56,542 --> 00:23:58,041
What are you doing here?

592
00:23:58,083 --> 00:24:00,166
Well, that--that's
a lovely greeting.

593
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:01,375
Is everything okay?

594
00:24:01,417 --> 00:24:04,041
Yeah, yeah, I just, uh...

595
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:05,291
Is that a gun?

596
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:07,834
Did you find out
Ethan's last name

597
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:09,041
and come here
to defend my virtue?

598
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:11,333
Look, about that, i'm...

599
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:13,250
I'm sorry
if I was acting weird

600
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:17,041
when you were telling me
that thing you were telling me.

601
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:18,125
You're still acting weird.

602
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:20,250
I know. Look, I...

603
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:22,041
I'm just--i'm...

604
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:23,750
It's gonna take me a minute
to get used to the idea

605
00:24:23,792 --> 00:24:25,750
that you're a-a woman.

606
00:24:25,792 --> 00:24:27,542
Ew. Don't call me that.

607
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:28,709
Well, what do you want me
to call you?

608
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:31,125
Ange.

609
00:24:32,417 --> 00:24:34,041
Come walk me
to my next class.

610
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:35,333
Anyway, I'm feeling...

611
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:36,750
I don't know,

612
00:24:36,792 --> 00:24:38,500
a little out of my depth
with all of this.

613
00:24:38,542 --> 00:24:40,000
I'm trying to figure out
the difference

614
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:41,291
between things that will help

615
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:44,041
and things
that will make you cringe.

616
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:47,083
Oh, god.
What's in the bag?

617
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:52,583
Seriously?

618
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:53,834
Condoms?

619
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:55,041
Just, you know...

620
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:56,917
Yeah, I know.

621
00:24:56,959 --> 00:24:58,792
Thanks.

622
00:24:58,834 --> 00:25:01,250
So you think maybe
one of these days

623
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,041
I can meet this Ethan?

624
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:04,959
I'd like that.

625
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,917
And maybe one of these days,
I can meet Addison.

626
00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:08,500
We could double date.

627
00:25:08,542 --> 00:25:10,917
Uh, yeah. I don't--
I don't think so.

628
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:12,041
Why? What's happening
with her?

629
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:13,417
Nothing's happening
with her.

630
00:25:13,458 --> 00:25:15,333
Don't you want to be
with her?

631
00:25:16,458 --> 00:25:17,959
I'd rather
have your mom back.

632
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,208
So do I,

633
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:22,500
but in a world of things
that actually could happen...

634
00:25:22,542 --> 00:25:25,166
Look, the point is,
being in love or whatever,

635
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:28,041
just feels completely amazing.

636
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:30,417
And I just feel,
you should try it again.

637
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:35,417
I can say that.
You just gave me condoms.

638
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:43,542
Okay,
it's time to take it.

639
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,041
I'll take it later.

640
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:46,625
No, you can't do that.

641
00:25:46,667 --> 00:25:48,458
No, I haven't eaten.

642
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,458
All right. Well, I'll
get you something to eat.

643
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,458
You know,
I don't want to, Sam.

644
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,375
And these pills
are not gonna help me.

645
00:25:54,417 --> 00:25:56,583
Uh, Corinne,
we're not doing this.

646
00:25:56,625 --> 00:25:57,875
Okay?

647
00:25:57,917 --> 00:25:59,500
The pills upset my stomach.

648
00:25:59,542 --> 00:26:01,291
That's because
you're not eating enough.

649
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:02,542
Mm.

650
00:26:05,083 --> 00:26:07,417
Happy now?

651
00:26:07,458 --> 00:26:10,208
You're gonna
have to eat some more.

652
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,417
No.

653
00:26:11,458 --> 00:26:12,917
Well, then
your stomach's gonna hurt.

654
00:26:12,959 --> 00:26:14,208
But you have to take
your pill, Corinne.

655
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:15,458
I'm not taking the pill.

656
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,041
Look, look, this is not
a negotiation.

657
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:18,417
Why are you doing this?

658
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:20,041
Because we made a deal.

659
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:21,417
You said
that you would try and--

660
00:26:21,458 --> 00:26:24,000
and you think I'm not trying?

661
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:26,166
I think that you're
making this a lot harder

662
00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:27,667
than it needs--
yeah, well, harder--
harder for you?

663
00:26:27,709 --> 00:26:30,291
I have to live like this.

664
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:31,834
You watch me,

665
00:26:31,875 --> 00:26:33,500
and you order me around,

666
00:26:33,542 --> 00:26:35,834
and you--
and you judge--silently--

667
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:37,041
but you judge.

668
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:39,041
I'm trying
to take care of you.

669
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:41,542
Now please take that pill.

00:26:41,583 --> 00:26:43,041

impossible for you,

900
00:37:10,208 --> 00:37:13,000
but, uh, somehow I...

901
00:37:13,041 --> 00:37:14,208
I made it about me, and--

902
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:17,458
no, I was awful
and--and I didn't listen.

903
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,208
Just--just let me finish.
Let me finish.

904
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:23,041
I don't ever,
ever want to hurt you.

905
00:37:23,083 --> 00:37:25,500
I didn't mean to scare you.

906
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:29,375
I'm terrified.

907
00:37:29,417 --> 00:37:33,000
And I don't...

908
00:37:36,125 --> 00:37:38,500
I don't know
how to do this.

909
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:42,041
Not the right way.

910
00:37:42,083 --> 00:37:43,709
You're doing your best,

911
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:47,000
and i'm--I'm the one
who's been screwing up.

912
00:37:50,083 --> 00:37:51,250
I talked to Dr. Wallace,

913
00:37:51,291 --> 00:37:53,125
and I think we may have--
have come up with--

914
00:37:53,166 --> 00:37:55,291
with a plan--

915
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:57,750
a better plan--
for moving forward.

916
00:37:57,792 --> 00:37:59,458
Ar-are you
giving up on me?

917
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,041
No.

918
00:38:01,083 --> 00:38:03,333
No.

919
00:38:03,375 --> 00:38:06,041
I will always be here
for you--

920
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:07,500
always be here for you--

921
00:38:07,542 --> 00:38:09,750
and I-I will come
and visit you.

922
00:38:09,792 --> 00:38:12,041
V--no, visit where?

923
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:13,500
No.

924
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:15,250
No, no. No, Sam.
All right. Just listen to me.

925
00:38:15,291 --> 00:38:17,041
No. Don't. Don't.
Listen, lis-listen.
There is a place...

926
00:38:17,083 --> 00:38:18,291
Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't.
And they have--

927
00:38:18,333 --> 00:38:19,250
no, no, please.

928
00:38:19,291 --> 00:38:21,083

please, please.

929
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:22,291
I-I'll be better.

930
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:24,125
You know, I know--i know
I wasn't--i wasn't good,

931
00:38:24,166 --> 00:38:26,250
but I-I can do it, Sam.

932
00:38:26,291 --> 00:38:29,000
I can do it. You--you can't--
don't put me away.

933
00:38:29,041 --> 00:38:30,250
No, I'm not
putting you away. No.

934
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:31,750
You're all I have left.
You can't.

935
00:38:31,792 --> 00:38:33,000
You need help,
and they can...

936
00:38:33,041 --> 00:38:34,291
You can't. You're--
take care of you.

937
00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:36,542
No. No. No. I'll-I'll sleep
and--and I'll eat,

938
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:37,375
and I'll take my pills,

939
00:38:37,417 --> 00:38:39,250
and--and--and I'll--I'll go

940
00:38:39,291 --> 00:38:41,250

Corinne--

941
00:38:41,291 --> 00:38:42,583
and--and--and--
no, no, no, no.

942
00:38:42,625 --> 00:38:44,041
And I won't talk about
the bad things.

943
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:45,709
I won't talk about the stars,
and--and I won't do that.

944
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,041
I won't do it. No, you can't.
You--please.

945
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:49,125
Shh.
No, please! You can't!
You can't put me away!

Stop.

Stop saying that. I'm not.

You can't
give up on me, Sam!

You can't! You can't!

951
00:38:59,458 --> 00:39:02,542
