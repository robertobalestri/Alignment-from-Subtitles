00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,083
We're in the back
of the store.

3
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:14,000
Dad has just given me
two pennies.

4
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:15,375
I liked to hide them

5
00:00:15,417 --> 00:00:17,792
in this big crack
in the floorboards.

6
00:00:17,834 --> 00:00:21,041
I'm saving them
so I can buy a town.

7
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:27,417
That's what I tell
my big brother Derek anyway.

8
00:00:30,792 --> 00:00:32,458
Two guys come in.

9
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:35,625
They'd already pulled a gun.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,333
They'd already taken
the money.

11
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:40,875
And now they want
his watch.

12
00:00:53,417 --> 00:00:55,834
Hey, Coop.

13
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:01,375
Amelia?

14
00:01:01,417 --> 00:01:03,041
Morning, Addie.

15
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:05,375
Let me grab some coffee,
then I'll be back.

16
00:01:05,417 --> 00:01:07,500
I have news.

17
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:10,667
Hey, everybody.

18
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:13,834
Coffee. I need coffee.

19
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:26,417
Okay, I took all the coffee,
but I will make a fresh pot.

20
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:30,041
Wow.

21
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:31,625
Okay, hi.

22
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:32,875
Sheldon.

23
00:01:32,917 --> 00:01:34,709
Sheldon.

24
00:01:36,917 --> 00:01:38,500
What?

25
00:01:38,542 --> 00:01:41,500
Do you guys know already?
Was Ryan here or something?

26
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:43,041
I'm engaged.

27
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:45,041
Hello!

28
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:47,917
Whoa.
What the hell was that?

29
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:48,917
We called the police.

30
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,208
And every hospital in L.A.

31
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,208
And the morgue.

32
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,291
Why?

33
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:53,417
Because we thought
you were dead.

34
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:55,041
Why would you think
I was dead?

35
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:57,208
Because no one has seen you.

36
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,834
What are you talking about?

37
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:00,667
I miss a couple of days
of work and suddenly i'm--

38
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:02,667
12.

39
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:03,667
What?

40
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:04,667
You missed 12 days of work.

41
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:08,375
No one has seen you
in 12 days.

42
00:02:08,417 --> 00:02:09,792
12 days?

43
00:02:09,834 --> 00:02:12,041
Amelia.

44
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:13,041
What are you on?

45
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:14,291
What are you talking about?

46
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:15,709
Are you high
right now?

47
00:02:24,542 --> 00:02:26,125
Look, okay...

48
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,375
I was...

49
00:02:27,417 --> 00:02:29,083
On drugs. I was.

50
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:30,166
I slipped.

51
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:32,000
I went on kind of a bender,
and it...

52
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,542
Well, it was scary.

53
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:35,750
It was really scary.

54
00:02:35,792 --> 00:02:37,291
For a minute, I thought, um,

55
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:38,917
I thought I was
going over the edge.

56
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,375
And then even Ryan
got worried about me.

57
00:02:41,417 --> 00:02:43,375
He says there's partying
and then there's...

58
00:02:43,417 --> 00:02:46,208
What I was doing was scary.

59
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,709
So he dragged me
to a meeting--

60
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,792
many meetings,
a lot of meetings--

61
00:02:51,834 --> 00:02:54,041
and I am so grateful to him
for that

62
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:55,959
because he helped me.
You know, he helped.

63
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,709
And I didn't realize
that it was 12 days,

64
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,625
and I can just imagine
what all of you thought,

65
00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:02,625
and I am so sorry
that you thought I was dead.

66
00:03:02,667 --> 00:03:05,041
Addie, I am so sorry,
but that's what I was doing.

67
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:06,208
I was going to meetings

68
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,083
and I was getting right
with my higher power

69
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:11,166
and I was just being sober
every day.

70
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:14,875
You're okay?

71
00:03:14,917 --> 00:03:16,750
I'm okay.

72
00:03:16,792 --> 00:03:19,041
I mean, I'm gonna have to go
to two or three meetings a day

73
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:20,542
for as long as it takes,

74
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,041
but I'm good.

75
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:24,166
I swear. I was lucky.

76
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,125
Oh, I was so worried
about you.

77
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,333
I know.
Thank you for worrying.

78
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,041
But you didn't need to.
Ryan saved me.

79
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,792
I mean, he helped.

80
00:03:31,834 --> 00:03:35,458
Now apparently, I have
a lot of work to catch up on,

81
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,000
so I will talk
to you guys later.

82
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,834
Oh, that's a relief.

83
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,083
I know.

84
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,291
I thought that, uh--

85
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,083
she's lying.

86
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,291
She is lying.

87
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,083
Charlotte, she--she seemed
okay to me.

88
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,166
That's because you're not
an addict.

89
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,917
She didn't seem
strung out.

90
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,291
You'd be surprised
at how adept an addict can be

91
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:57,000
at hiding their addiction.

92
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:59,041
I toyed with the idea
of specializing in addiction

93
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,792
before I chose fertility.

94
00:04:00,834 --> 00:04:02,166
We have to do something.

95
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,041
If she's lying.

96
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,041
Charlotte...

97
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,166
Is it...

98
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,792
Possible--
I mean, is it just possible,

99
00:04:07,834 --> 00:04:09,166
given your history,

100
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,166
that you're blowing this
out of proportion?

101
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:14,041
Because of my history,
I know the games,

102
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,083
the secrets,
and the lies.

103
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,917

171

Hello.

172
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,250
Hi, Amelia. I'm Lenny.

173
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,834
Does she have a brain tumor,

174
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:26,667
a giant carcinoma that she
wants me to excise?

175
00:07:26,709 --> 00:07:28,041
That had better be what is
going on here, because--

176
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,500
Amelia, everybody here
cares about you,

177
00:07:30,542 --> 00:07:31,959
and they'd like you to stay

178
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,208
and listen to what
they have to say.

179
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,458
Will you do that?

180
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,000
An intervention?

181
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:45,000
An intervention?

182
00:07:46,542 --> 00:07:49,000
Okay. You know what?
I have patients to see.

183
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,792
There are no patients
coming today.

184
00:07:50,834 --> 00:07:51,792
Today is about you.

185
00:07:51,834 --> 00:07:53,125

freaking kidding me?

186
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:54,667
Amelia--

187
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:57,041
doctor. Dr. Shepherd, and I know
how an intervention works.

188
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:59,333
You're not the one who talks.
You are just the party planner.

189
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:00,792
One of you--

190
00:08:00,834 --> 00:08:03,166
one of you is supposed to have
the guts to speak up

191
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,875
instead of hiding
behind this chick.

192
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:07,917
One of you has to have the balls
to say something to me.

193
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,959
Do you?

194
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,041
Any of you?

195
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:15,291
Okay.

196
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:16,709
Great intervention.

197
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,041
I have been intervened upon.

198
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,417
I will see you tomorrow.

199
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,417
I'm not letting you leave.
Sheldon.

200
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:22,417
I'm not letting you leave.

201
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:23,542
Addison.

202
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,291
She's upset. She has
a right to be upset.

203
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,500
Addison--
she thinks
she's being ambushed.

204
00:08:26,542 --> 00:08:28,125
I'm just saying
that I'm not sure

205
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,500
this is the right way
to go.

206
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:30,917
Do you want to do this?

207
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:32,125
Then you can.
You can do this.

208
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,291
Amelia, get off the elevator.

209
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,834
Screw both of you.

210
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,709
If you don't get off
the elevator, I will fire you.

211
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,417
Then I quit.

212
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,041
Amelia--

213
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,333
Amelia, get off the elevator,
or I'll call the police on you.

214
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:45,750
And tell them what?

215
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:46,750
And tell them you've been
writing prescriptions

216
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:49,458
for your own personal drug use.

217
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,000
You don't know
what you're talking about.

218
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,667
Yeah, actually, I do.

219
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,542
Okay. Fine.

220
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:59,625
I will stay at the practice.

221
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:00,792
Amelia--

222
00:09:00,834 --> 00:09:02,041
I said I would stay
at the practice.

223
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,583
I did not say I would
hang out with you.

224
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,125
- This isn't working.
- A united front.

225
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,333
She just walked out.

226
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,750
So go after her.
You have to be in this.

227
00:09:08,792 --> 00:09:10,333
You can't just come along
for the ride.

228
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,959
There are times that you're
gonna have to steer the ship.

229
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,041
We're using sailing...
Metaphors now?

230
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,792
I mean, can I just--
what are the qualifications

231
00:09:17,834 --> 00:09:19,166
for this anyway?

232
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,375
Are you even--i mean, is there
a certification for this?

233
00:09:21,417 --> 00:09:23,000
Are you qualified to do this?

234
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,041
Addison--

235
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,208
we all agreed.

236
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,667
Fine. I'll go.

237
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,792
Look, I know...

238
00:09:40,834 --> 00:09:42,959
This is...

239
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,875
Would you just listen to
what everyone has to say?

240
00:09:46,917 --> 00:09:48,917
Addison, I got sober young.

241
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,458
And then I spent the bulk
of my 20s in a library,

242
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,208
studying my ass off--

243
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:57,041
college, med school,
residency, neuro fellowship.

244
00:09:57,083 --> 00:10:00,208
So now I wanted to have
some fun.

245
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,458
I made a mistake,
and now I'm fine.

246
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,709
I would think you'd get that.

247
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,500
I do. I get that.

248
00:10:06,542 --> 00:10:09,333
But... you are an addict,

249
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,500
Amelia.

250
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:13,041
You down a bottle of wine
with every meal.

251
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,500
You drink when you're happy

252
00:10:14,542 --> 00:10:16,500
and when you're sad
and when it's Tuesday.

253
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:18,917
Should we do an intervention
about your alcoholism?

254
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,458
I don't have a problem.
That's the difference here.

255
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,083
I don't need to drink.

256
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,041
I haven't had a drink
in months.

257
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,875
Yeah, because the only thing

258
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:28,166
you're more addicted to
than booze is having a baby,

259
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,709
which is sad,
because, hell,

260
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,792
you're friggin' barren.

261
00:10:31,834 --> 00:10:34,000
You waited too long,
and your junk dried up,

262
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,166
and you've ruined any man

263
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,125
who would want to even consider
impregnating you.

264
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:40,000
Poor Derek. Poor Mark.

265
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,458
You aborted his kid, right?

266
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,750
And now you've got Sam,
and at least he's smart enough

267
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:47,542
to not want to try
and breed with you,

268
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:48,959
because let's be honest--

269
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,959
not even Rosemary's baby
would want to live

270
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
amongst the tumbleweeds
in your uterus.

271
00:10:57,792 --> 00:11:00,041
Mm.

272
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,208
Amelia--

273
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,709
dude, seriously?

274
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,500
I barely know you.
What are you even doing here?

275
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:08,291
You're right.
You don't know me.

276
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:11,291
I'm here because we all agreed
we would be here.

277
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:12,834
And I'm here because

278
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:16,041
you don't get how lonely
most people are.

279
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,417
See, most people,
they just go to work.

280
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,709
They go to work, they come home,
maybe they have friends.

281
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,041
But on any given day,
they're not sharing as much

282
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,291
or caring as much
or giving as much

283
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,083
as all of you give
to each other on a--

284
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:30,041
on an average Wednesday.

285
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:33,041
So, yes, you're right,
I don't know you.

286
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,250
But I know that you have
a family here

287
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,375
and I see
that you're destroying it.

288
00:11:37,417 --> 00:11:39,667
If you continue
down this path,

289
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:42,375
you won't just
go down alone, Amelia.

290
00:11:42,417 --> 00:11:45,792
You'll take all the people
that love you down with you.

291
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,834
What do we do now? Do we
just, like, leave, or is it--
Coop.

292
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,041
No, I'm just saying,

293
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,041
she's not listening.
She's not listening.

294
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,792
I'm not
in favor of this.

295
00:12:05,834 --> 00:12:08,792
Research shows that group
confrontational strategies

296
00:12:08,834 --> 00:12:10,834
with alcohol and drug abusers
do not work.

297
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:13,000
She's going to go
into withdrawal soon.

298
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:14,000
What?

299
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,291
She's using.

300
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:16,917
At a certain point, she's
going to go into withdrawal.

301
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,041
That's our chance.

302
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:20,041
We just have to keep her here
till that happens.

303
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,667
Yeah, but she's not high
right now.

304
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:23,208
Yes, she is.
No, she's not.

305
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,000
She is. She is.

306
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:28,041
She'll be coming through
those doors any minute.

307
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,166
Her high
will be on its way out,

308
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,583
and we stand between her

309
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,875
and getting out of here
to get more drugs.

310
00:12:32,917 --> 00:12:36,458
She'll be a little bit sweaty,
irritable, twitchy, tweaking.

311
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,041
My guess is,
she's an oxy girl?

312
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,250
Nothing like oxycodone
to turn a nice girl

313
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,083
into bitch on wheels.

314
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,625
Any minute...

315
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:46,667
She's coming through
those doors.

316
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:14,166
Whatever you have to say,
spit it out so I can go.

317
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,709
I don't have all day.

318
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:31,041
My watch?
No. You have the money.

319
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,041
Just take it and go.

320
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,792
Just... go.

321
00:13:34,834 --> 00:13:37,166
Shh.

322
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,458
My mom gave my dad
that watch.

323
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,542
It was a symbol
of their life together...

324
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:44,750
Of how much she loved him.

325
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,291
Okay. Okay.

326
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,583
Everyone's gonna take turns
talking now.

327
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,709
And they're all here
because they want to help you.

328
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,041
So try to keep that in mind.

329
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,166
This is not about anyone
judging you.

330
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,375
This is--
okay, lady.

331
00:13:59,417 --> 00:14:01,041
You have clearly
never met these people.

332
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,750
Amelia--
fine.

333
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:05,000
Who's talking first?

334
00:14:09,542 --> 00:14:10,500
Perfect.

335
00:14:10,542 --> 00:14:13,583
Shrink talk. My favorite.

336
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,917
So, um,

337
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:17,125
we're not--we're not close,

338
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,041
so I don't have anything
personal to...

339
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:22,583
Uh, I was just gonna ask you
if you're feeling okay.

340
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,333
You're sweating

341
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,041
and your foot is shaking.

342
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,583
And you're aging
and your husband hates you.

343
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:30,041
So, you know,
things could be worse for me.

344
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,750
A-Amelia--
it's okay. Pete. It's okay.

345
00:14:31,792 --> 00:14:34,000
She's scared.
She's lashing out.

346
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,625
I've had patients that are

347
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:38,041
angrier than you
and sicker than you,

348
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,542
so I can take it.

349
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,542
Awesome. Are you
lookin' for applause,

350
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:42,542
as usual?

351
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:43,542
Amelia--
it's okay, Pete.

352
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:44,750
No, i-it's not okay.

353
00:14:44,792 --> 00:14:46,333
Honestly, Pete,
all I have been able to think

354
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:49,667
since I saved your pathetic life
is, was it worth it?

355
00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:51,041
'Cause you're
kind of a tool.

356
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:54,083
I mean, maybe saving you
was a waste of my energy.

357
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:57,250
Maybe it was a waste of
my mad, mad surgical skills.

358
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:58,834
Maybe you're a waste of life.

359
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:01,709
Maybe angel-of-death dude
should call it a day

360
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,709
and swallow some pills
yourself.

361
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,250
What do you say, cross on over
to the other side?

362
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:08,250
It'd give your wife some great
material for her next book,

363
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,083
and she'd love that.

364
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,250
That's her thing--

365
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,041
raping her personal experiences
for attention.

366
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,500
Oops. Did I say rape?

367
00:15:15,542 --> 00:15:17,208
Sorry, Charlotte.

368
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,917
Oh, my god. Are you okay?

369
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,583
Yeah. Are you?

370
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:01,750
Yeah.

371
00:16:01,792 --> 00:16:02,959
Oh.

372
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,750
She's like a dog.

373
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:08,667
She's like...
She's like a cornered dog.

374
00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:12,041
She's like a cornered,
injured--

375
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,041
Rabid...

376
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:17,041
Rabid dog. Oh.

377
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,041
Oh.

378
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,792
Oh.
Oh.

379
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:28,041
You two all right?

380
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,166
Yeah.

381
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:30,208
Yeah.

382
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,834
Did she shoot anyone yet?

383
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,625
Not yet.

384
00:16:34,667 --> 00:16:35,834
Look, I can't ask everyone,

385
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,041
because we're
in the middle of it,

386
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,750
but...

387
00:16:38,792 --> 00:16:41,208
I think it's time.

388
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,750
Violet?

389
00:16:42,792 --> 00:16:44,333
Why is it all on me?

390
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,959
You're the shrink.

391
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:50,875
Do it.

392
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,750
Is this all there is,

393
00:16:57,792 --> 00:16:59,750
your big intervention--
just screwed up people

394
00:16:59,792 --> 00:17:01,542
telling me how screwed up
I am?

395
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:04,041
Because last I checked,
I'm a world-class neurosurgeon

396
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,583
with a near-perfect
surgical record.

397
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,041
So if you want to intervene,
fine.

398
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,000
I can go all day.
Can you?

399
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:11,041
Go all day?

400
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,875
Are we talking
in riddles now?

401
00:17:12,917 --> 00:17:14,041
Are you the riddler?

402
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,583
Are you riddling me stuff
right now?

403
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,792
Because I might need a pen
to write this down.
I gotta admit,

404
00:17:18,834 --> 00:17:20,583
I'm kind of loving you
right now.

405
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,458
I am loving you.

406
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,250
You are winning
better than Charlie sheen...

407
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:30,000
As long as I overlook the fact
that you're a giant oxy addict

408
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,583
who's killing herself.

409
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:34,041
Everyone here
is in agreement.

410
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,625
You will
no longer be enabled.

411
00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:38,041
Enabled?

412
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,709
Is that one of your special
s.A.T. Words?

413
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,875
I'll change the locks.

414
00:17:42,917 --> 00:17:44,083
Until you get help,
I'll change the locks.

415
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,542
You can't live
at my house anymore.

416
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,834
I will change the locks.

417
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,625
I will throw you out.

418
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:54,834
Then I will
call in your mother

419
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,291
and your brother
and your sisters,

420
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,041
and then I will call
the medical board

421
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,166
and report you,
because I love you, Amelia,

422
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,834
but I will not
love you to death.

423
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,291
Water?

424
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:27,917
Bupe.

425
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:29,917
Nice little drug.

426
00:18:29,959 --> 00:18:31,417
You dissolve it in water.

427
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:34,625
It'll make withdrawal symptoms
go away immediately.

428
00:18:34,667 --> 00:18:35,875
It'll also prevent any drugs

429
00:18:35,917 --> 00:18:37,250
from getting me high
for 72 hours.

430
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:38,834
Excellent work.

431
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,834
Big pharma has done us all
a favor.

432
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:43,041
Amelia, please.
It could help you.

433
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,291
It'll at least give you

434
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,709
a chance to hear us
without being high,

435
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,041
without going through
withdrawal.

436
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,500
I told you, I'm drug free.
I have been for five days.

437
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:51,083
I am not
going through withdrawal.

438
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:53,000
I'm clean.

439
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,375
Well, then take the bupe.

440
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:56,125
Amelia, we all love you.
It--

441
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,125
it'll help you feel better.
Give it a shot.

442
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:01,709
Then we can talk you
through this.

443
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,542
Please.

444
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:14,041
You want me to stay and listen
so that I can get sober?

445
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,959
Yes.

446
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:20,834

Fine.

448
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,166
Get me some oxy.

449
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,583
Score me some oxy...

450
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:35,417
And then I will stay
as long as you want.

We're not doing this.

We're--we're not supporting
her drug habit.

495
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,041
Just because
she lacks discipline

496

00:21:36,709 --> 00:21:38,041
she is an addict.

498
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,667
She has a disease.
It's a disease, Sam.

499
00:21:40,709 --> 00:21:42,709
Okay, all right. Well,
I think we should take a vote.

of giving her oxy?

I shouldn't vote.

00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,333

You people...

510
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,041
You have no idea what you're
doing to her. And you.

511
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:08,041
What kind of doctor are you?

512
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:09,750
You should know better.

513
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:13,542
Hey.

514
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,375
Look,

515
00:22:16,417 --> 00:22:18,291
we have a difference
of opinion, all right?

516
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:19,917
It happens
around here all the time.

517
00:22:19,959 --> 00:22:21,500
You're about a century behind
in your thinking.

518
00:22:21,542 --> 00:22:23,583
You think addicts should,
what, be locked up,

519
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:25,583
institutionalized
instead of treated?

520
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:28,500
I think that Amelia should take
responsibility for her actions.

521
00:22:28,542 --> 00:22:29,792
You think Pete

522
00:22:29,834 --> 00:22:31,000
should take responsibility
for his heart attack?

523
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:33,041
Uh, that's not
the same thing.

524
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:34,917
Why not?
Because Pete
has heart disease.

525
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:36,083
Amelia has a disease, too.

526
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:38,041
That's your opinion.
Look...

527
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:40,542
Jake, we both know that
that is up for debate

528
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:43,041
in the medical community,
all right?

529
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:44,542
The whole disease model
comes from a.A.,

530
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:46,041
where the first thing
they try to do

531
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:47,333
is get people to admit

532
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:49,333
that they're powerless
against their addiction.

533
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:51,041
Because drugs function
differently in their bodies.

534
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:53,125
Addiction is
a threefold disease.

535
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:54,959
It's a "disease"
that doesn't fire up

536
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,750
unless you take the drugs.

537
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,750
Amelia has control
over that, right?

538
00:22:58,792 --> 00:23:00,041
I mean, she made a choice

539
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:01,583
the first time
she took those drugs,

540
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:03,959
just like she has
a choice today.

541
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,625
Wow.

542
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:07,333
You think
people choose that misery?

543
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:09,041
You think they--you think
they choose that life?

544
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:10,333
You think they want to be

545
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:12,041
licking drugs
off of bathroom floors

546
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:14,834
and neglecting their kids
and destroying their husbands

547
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:16,166
and killing themselves?

548
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:18,583
You think anyone who is not
in the throes of a disease

549
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:21,041
would consciously do that
to themselves?

550
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:23,041
- Is that what you think?
- Jake.

551
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:24,041
What?

552
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:25,792
Are you okay?
Do you want to talk?

553
00:23:25,834 --> 00:23:27,000
No.

554
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:28,625
You think it'd be all right
if, uh...

555
00:23:28,667 --> 00:23:30,208
Yeah, yeah, there's
lots of us in there.

556
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:35,875
I guess I hit a nerve.

557
00:23:35,917 --> 00:23:37,458
Yeah, well...

558
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,083
There's a lot of those
flying around today.

559
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:43,041
Kinda hard to avoid.

560
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:47,417
We should probably
get back in there.

561
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:49,750
Do we have to?

562
00:23:49,792 --> 00:23:51,959
"You are
someone's child, Amelia.

563
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,208
That's all I keep thinking."

564
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:57,417
"I don't care how old you are,
you are always someone's child.

565
00:23:57,458 --> 00:24:00,041
"I work with kids all day.
I see that love.

566
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:03,458
I have to give news
to parents every day"...
I want my drugs.

567
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,875
"Leukemia, cancer,
kids with diseases"...
Give me my drugs.
I want my drugs.

568
00:24:05,917 --> 00:24:08,917
- Give me my drugs.
- I want my drugs.

569
00:24:08,959 --> 00:24:10,041
Give me my drugs.
"Kids with diseases..."

570
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:11,625
What do we want? Drugs.
"There's no worse news."

571
00:24:11,667 --> 00:24:14,041
When do we want 'em? Now.
What do we want? Drugs.

572
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:16,750
"It's killing me to see what
this disease is doing to you."
When do we want 'em? Now.

573
00:24:16,792 --> 00:24:18,125
What do we want? Drugs.
"There are things that you could
do to treat your disease"...

574
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:19,709
When do we want 'em? Now.
"And get your life back"...

575
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,917
What do we want? Drugs.
"And you're not doing them."

576
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:23,792
When do we want 'em? Now.
"You owe it to the people who
love you to try to get well."

577
00:24:23,834 --> 00:24:26,000
What do we want? Drugs.
When do we want 'em? Now.
"You at least have to try,

578
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:27,750
because you are someone's kid
and because you're my friend."
What do we want? Drugs.

579
00:24:27,792 --> 00:24:29,333
When do we want 'em? Now!
What do we want? Drugs!

580
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:31,250
When do we want 'em? Now!

581
00:24:31,291 --> 00:24:34,333
What do we want? Drugs!
When do we want 'em? Now!

582
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:37,542
What do we want? Drugs!
When do we want 'em? Now!

583
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:39,291
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen!

584
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:40,458
My next show
will be in five minutes!

585
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,875
Addison, where are you going?

586
00:24:41,917 --> 00:24:43,250
What does she want? Drugs.
When does she want them? Now.

587
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:45,041
We agreed that we wouldn't.

588
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,458
I didn't. I didn't agree.

589
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,458
Addison--

590
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,667
that--
that thing in there?

591
00:24:48,709 --> 00:24:51,917
That used to be
a person, okay?

592
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:53,625
And she was sweet
and she was funny,

593
00:24:53,667 --> 00:24:55,083
and I took her to get
her ears pierced,

594
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:57,625
and i-i-i-i did her hair
for her for prom,

595
00:24:57,667 --> 00:24:59,333
and I told her all about
birth control

596
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:01,709
when she didn't know
who to ask,

597
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,542
and we were sisters,
you know?

598
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:05,041
We were closer than sisters.

599
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:07,375
Now she's...

600
00:25:07,417 --> 00:25:09,500
That used to be
Amelia Shepherd.

601
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:11,625
That used to be someone
that I love,

602
00:25:11,667 --> 00:25:12,834
and I want her back.

603
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:14,709
And if it means
me giving her some oxy

604
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,041
so she can
shut up and listen,

605
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:17,291
so she doesn't
get on that elevator?

606
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:19,917
Great. Fine.
I'll be her drug dealer.

607
00:25:19,959 --> 00:25:23,041
I just want her back.

608
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:26,750
Where are you going?

609
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:28,500
To get the keys
to the drug dispensary.

610
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:37,125
Outta my way, Sam.

611
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:38,542
You have a tough life?

612
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:40,750
Everybody's life is tough.

613
00:25:40,792 --> 00:25:42,125
Life comes with pain.

614
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:44,750
Sometimes that pain
is unthinkable,

615
00:25:44,792 --> 00:25:47,458
but that--that's no excuse
to throw it away like this.

616
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,959
Everybody here has been
through hell and back--

617
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,625
Pete, Violet, Charlotte.

618
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:54,792
We're not using.
I swear to god, Sam--

619
00:25:54,834 --> 00:25:57,041
shut up! You want to stop
being a drug ad--you--

620
00:25:57,083 --> 00:25:59,041
this is how you stop
being a drug addict.

621
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:01,792
Stop using drugs!

622
00:26:01,834 --> 00:26:05,875
Grow up! Take some
responsibility for yourself.

623
00:26:07,542 --> 00:26:09,041
That's my girl.

624
00:26:09,083 --> 00:26:10,041
Addie...

625
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:12,041
Gotta love that woman
of yours, Sam.

626
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:13,291
Of course, we all know
you can't commit,

627
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:15,166
so maybe you don't gotta,
but I do.

628
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:17,917
Addison-- we talked about this.
 Absolutely not.

629
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:19,250
What the hell
are you thinking?

630
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:20,667
She's thinking that Amelia's
in trouble,

631
00:26:20,709 --> 00:26:22,834
and if we let her leave--
thank you, Addison.

632
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:25,000
Oh, no. Here.

633
00:26:26,333 --> 00:26:27,625
What?

634
00:26:27,667 --> 00:26:29,041
You want to do your drugs,
you do 'em here,

635
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:30,500
in front of all these people
who care about you.

636
00:26:30,542 --> 00:26:32,458
Show them who you really are.

637
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,625
Or don't do the drugs
at all,

638
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:37,208
and show them
who you want to be.

639
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,000
It's your choice.

640
00:27:25,917 --> 00:27:27,041
Ahh.

641
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:39,208
Sure as I'm sitting here,

642
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,083
if you keep up at this,

643
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:44,041
you're gonna kill someone.

644
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:46,041
You're gonna
walk into some O.R.,

645
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:49,542
you're gonna get behind
the wheel of a car...

646
00:27:49,583 --> 00:27:52,125
You're gonna kill someone,
Amelia.

647
00:27:52,166 --> 00:27:54,959
That's where this goes.

648
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,417
And when you do...

649
00:27:56,458 --> 00:27:58,625
When you do that,

650
00:27:58,667 --> 00:28:00,041
you don't come back
from it.

651
00:28:00,083 --> 00:28:02,041
Maybe you get sober...

652
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:04,542
But you don't come back.

653
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:08,333
You spend every day
trying to be a better person,

654
00:28:08,375 --> 00:28:10,041
trying to save a life,

655
00:28:10,083 --> 00:28:12,041
trying to make it right.

656
00:28:12,083 --> 00:28:14,041
But you can't give
that mother back her child

657
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:16,834
or that husband back
his wife.

658
00:28:16,875 --> 00:28:20,166
You walk and you talk
and you breathe,

659
00:28:20,208 --> 00:28:24,041
and sometimes you even
smile or laugh...

660
00:28:24,083 --> 00:28:27,208
But you don't come back.

661
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,375
Okay, I gotta ask.

662
00:28:32,417 --> 00:28:33,792
What is the point of this now?

663
00:28:33,834 --> 00:28:35,333
She's so high,
she can't even listen to us.

664
00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:36,583
I'm listening.

665
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:41,792
What Charlotte said
was very beautiful...

666
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:46,083
And real.

667
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:50,875
And I worry about that.

668
00:28:50,917 --> 00:28:52,291
I do.

669
00:28:56,667 --> 00:28:58,625
Just give us 30 days--

670
00:28:58,667 --> 00:29:00,500
30 days to get you
clean and sober--

671
00:29:00,542 --> 00:29:02,583
then you can start over again.

672
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:05,041
A clean slate.

673
00:29:06,709 --> 00:29:08,875
That sounds nice, but I...

674
00:29:08,917 --> 00:29:10,875
I don't think
I can do it.

675
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:12,000
Oh, you can.

676
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:13,500
You can. I know you can.

677
00:29:13,542 --> 00:29:15,834
We'll help you.
I'll help you.

678
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:17,208
Amelia, please.

679
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:20,917
There's a great rehab facility.
They have a bed waiting for you.

680
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:23,208
It's... it's right near
the ocean.

681
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:29,000
Will you come, too?

682
00:29:30,875 --> 00:29:33,417
I'll come see you
every day.

683
00:29:33,458 --> 00:29:35,041
I'll... I will.

684
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:36,417
I'll be there.

685
00:29:37,458 --> 00:29:39,792
I'll be there.
Yeah, I will.

686
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:51,458
Ryan.

687
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,667
Oof.

688
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:56,750
Oh!

689
00:30:14,083 --> 00:30:15,917
You need to go.

690
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:16,917
Sam--

691
00:30:16,959 --> 00:30:17,917
no. He's gotta go.
Leave.

692
00:30:17,959 --> 00:30:19,250
Ryan and I are getting married.
Now.

693
00:30:19,291 --> 00:30:20,583
- Don't speak to him like that.
- You realize

694
00:30:20,625 --> 00:30:22,458
you'll never get sober
if you stay with him, ever.

695
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,250
Amelia's addiction
is not Ryan's fault.

696
00:30:24,291 --> 00:30:26,750
As a matter of fact, Ryan,
if you want to get sober,

697
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:28,792
we'll help you, too.
No, no, we won't.

698
00:30:28,834 --> 00:30:30,333
Yes, we will,
if that's what it takes.

699
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:32,959
No, our commitment,
our concern is for Amelia.

700
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,125
I know, and she will do better

701
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,917
if the person she loves
is also in the program,

702
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,083
is getting sober as well.

703
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:38,542
There's studies on this.
Sheldon, back me up.

704
00:30:38,583 --> 00:30:40,333
Okay, I just think we need
to discuss this before we s--

705
00:30:40,375 --> 00:30:42,333
I think what Violet
and Lenny said is right.

706
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:44,750
I believe we can help anyone
who wants to get sober.

707
00:30:44,792 --> 00:30:47,625
He didn't say
he wants to get sober.

708
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:55,041
You gave him
your father's watch?

709
00:30:55,083 --> 00:30:56,417
Amelia.

710
00:30:56,458 --> 00:30:57,959
Amelia, look at me.

711
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,375
It's his engagement present.

712
00:30:59,417 --> 00:31:01,458
It's your father's watch.

713
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,208
Leave me alone.

714
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,834
Maybe just give her
a little bit of space--

715
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:06,583
this is none of your business!
I am speaking to my sister!

716
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:07,667
I'm not your sister.
Look at this.

717
00:31:07,709 --> 00:31:09,375
You took this
from your mother?

718
00:31:09,417 --> 00:31:12,000
Do you know how that's
gonna make her feel?

719
00:31:12,041 --> 00:31:13,375
Okay,
let's, everyone, calm down.

720
00:31:13,417 --> 00:31:15,041
What is the significance
of the watch?

721
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:17,041
Nothing. It's a watch.
Amelia.

722
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,208
My mom gave it to my dad
for their anniversary one year.

723
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:21,208
That is not the significance.
Addison--

724
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:23,208
it's not,
and you know it's not, Sam.

725
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,750
Amelia.

726
00:31:25,792 --> 00:31:28,041
Two guys came into
her father's store

727
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:29,041
when she was 5 year--
shut up!

728
00:31:29,083 --> 00:31:30,041
Whoa.

729
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:31,542
You do not tell that story!

730
00:31:31,583 --> 00:31:33,041
That is not your story!
He was not your dad!

731
00:31:33,083 --> 00:31:35,041
He was my dad!

732
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:36,875
You shut your mouth!

733
00:31:36,917 --> 00:31:38,417
Shut up,

734
00:31:38,458 --> 00:31:41,250
you stupid,
ignorant monster bitch!

735
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:44,041
You do not tell that story.

736
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:46,667
You do not ever
tell that story.

737
00:31:46,709 --> 00:31:50,041
You ever tell that story
to anyone...

738
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:52,917
And I will kill you
with my bare hands.

739
00:31:54,291 --> 00:31:56,458
Let's go. I want to go.

740
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:03,291
Come on. Please...
Stay.

741
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:04,667
Sheldon...

742
00:32:04,709 --> 00:32:07,250
I will never love you back.

743
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:09,875
You get that, right?

744
00:32:15,583 --> 00:32:16,709
It was nice to see you all.

745
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,709
Hope to see you all again
real soon

746
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:21,291
when things calm down.

747
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:28,041
We're in the back of the store.

748
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:30,125
Dad has just given me
two pennies.

749
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:31,875
Two guys come in.

750
00:32:31,917 --> 00:32:33,500
We can hear them talking.

751
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:36,333
But we don't pay attention
until dad yells.

752
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Shh.

753
00:32:43,083 --> 00:32:46,041
Two guys shot my dad
for his watch.

754
00:33:23,375 --> 00:33:25,375
Your--your friends, um...

755
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,041
No one's ever tried
to save me like that.

756
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:31,625
No one's ever cared enough.

757
00:33:31,667 --> 00:33:35,917
And I've never been around
anyone like you before.

758
00:33:35,959 --> 00:33:38,000
You make me want...

759
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:42,333
Your mom gave your dad
this watch

760
00:33:42,375 --> 00:33:44,000
for their anniversary.

761
00:33:45,166 --> 00:33:47,875
I want to have anniversaries
with you,

762
00:33:47,917 --> 00:33:50,166
lots of 'em,

763
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:52,208
and kids.

764
00:33:57,083 --> 00:34:00,667
If we were sober,
we could have kids

765
00:34:00,709 --> 00:34:02,041
and a life.

766
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:03,375
We could have a life, too.

767
00:34:05,875 --> 00:34:07,417
You want kids?

768
00:34:07,458 --> 00:34:09,583
We'd have to be clean.

769
00:34:09,625 --> 00:34:11,333
My father was a cokehead,

770
00:34:11,375 --> 00:34:14,041
and I won't--i...

771
00:34:14,083 --> 00:34:16,041
I can't.

772
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:17,792
We have to be clean.

773
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:21,500
Okay.

774
00:34:21,542 --> 00:34:24,417
Do you want to get sober
with me?

775
00:34:24,458 --> 00:34:26,834
Yeah.

776
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,667
Let's get sober together.

777
00:34:35,083 --> 00:34:36,500
This is great.

778
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:37,917
This is gonna be so great.

779
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:39,917
It is. I can get the names
of some rehab places,

780
00:34:39,959 --> 00:34:41,291
and we go in together
and we go out together.

781
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:43,500
This is a commitment.
This is important.

782
00:34:43,542 --> 00:34:46,375
Can you do this? 'Cause if
you can't, we can al--

783
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,583
I can do it. I can.

784
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:02,041
We should probably
flush these.

785
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:04,750
Yeah. Yeah.

786
00:35:04,792 --> 00:35:07,208
Or...

787
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:09,041
One last time?

788
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:11,041
I don't--i don't know.

789
00:35:11,083 --> 00:35:14,000
Okay. Okay, flush 'em.

790
00:35:23,709 --> 00:35:25,125
One last time.

791
00:35:33,625 --> 00:35:36,917
So how many kids
do you want?

792
00:35:36,959 --> 00:35:39,458
Three.

793
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,250
Two boys...

794
00:35:41,291 --> 00:35:43,291
And a girl.

795
00:35:45,083 --> 00:35:46,792
How about four?

796
00:35:48,125 --> 00:35:52,375
Two boys, two girls--that way,
no one gets lonely.

797
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:54,166
Deal?

798
00:35:56,125 --> 00:35:58,000
Deal.

799
00:36:27,375 --> 00:36:31,959
You are so gorgeous.

800
00:36:40,083 --> 00:36:41,750
What now?

801
00:36:41,792 --> 00:36:43,125
Now you
have to cut her off.

802
00:36:43,166 --> 00:36:45,000
When Amelia calls,
and she will call,

803
00:36:45,041 --> 00:36:49,041
unless she's ready for help,
you don't give her a ride.

804
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:50,458
You don't give her money

805
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,125
or a place to stay
or her job back.

806
00:36:53,166 --> 00:36:55,208
The only call
you can respond to

807
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:57,250
is Amelia calling you for help
to get off drugs.

808
00:36:57,291 --> 00:36:58,667
That's it.

809
00:36:58,709 --> 00:37:00,041
It's up to her now.

810
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:01,959
This was a bad idea.

811
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,750
This is what works.
But it didn't work.

812
00:37:03,792 --> 00:37:04,750
She's out on the street.

813
00:37:04,792 --> 00:37:05,750
Doing god knows what.

814
00:37:05,792 --> 00:37:06,750
Yeah, with Ryan.

815
00:37:06,792 --> 00:37:07,709
We lost her.

816
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:09,083
No, I lost her.

817
00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:11,375
I lost her.

818
00:37:11,417 --> 00:37:14,041
You don't know that. We started
something for her today.

819
00:37:14,083 --> 00:37:16,041
Progress was made.

820
00:37:16,083 --> 00:37:18,709
You may not see it.
Sometimes it takes time.

821
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,625
Results aren't always
immediate.

822
00:37:20,667 --> 00:37:24,834
Sometimes... an addict
actually has to hit rock bottom.

823
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:27,792
Amelia snorting oxycodone

824
00:37:27,834 --> 00:37:31,000
off the reception desk
doesn't qualify as rock bottom?

825
00:37:39,083 --> 00:37:42,667
15 years, 3 months,
and 4 days ago,

826
00:37:42,709 --> 00:37:45,250
I took my 5-year-old son
to the park.

827
00:37:45,291 --> 00:37:47,333
He was on the swings,
having so much fun.

828
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:49,041
It was a beautiful day.

829
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:50,834
The sun was shining.

830
00:37:50,875 --> 00:37:52,458
He had other kids
to play with.

831
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,083
We had all afternoon.

832
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:57,250
He was on the swings.
He was okay.

833
00:37:57,291 --> 00:37:59,875
I knew he was, 'cause I could
hear him laughing

834
00:37:59,917 --> 00:38:03,834
as I was shooting the tenner
of heroin I had on me.

835
00:38:03,875 --> 00:38:04,959
I passed out.

836
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,250
I came to
an hour or so later,

837
00:38:07,291 --> 00:38:09,041
and my son was gone.

838
00:38:09,083 --> 00:38:11,250
