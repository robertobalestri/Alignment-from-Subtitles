120
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:34,417
Uh, Dr. Turner, would you take
Jodi to the lobby, please?

121
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,041
Absolutely.

122
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,291

123
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:41,542

125
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:46,125
After Jodi gives birth,

126
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,709
I'm taking the baby.

127
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm taking the baby,

Who are Zach and Jodi?

131
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:10,959
Jodi is eight and a half months
pregnant, with the worst case

132
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,500
of anterograde amnesia
I've ever seen,

133
00:05:12,542 --> 00:05:14,041
and Zach is her ass of husband

134
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,250
who is waiting for her
to give birth

135
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,542
so he can take the baby
and leave.

136
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,000
What did you say
to my patient?

137
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:22,125
Wait. You asked Sheldon
to cover your cases.

138
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,542
Doesn't that make Zach
his patient?

139
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,500
Zach made his own decision.

140
00:05:24,542 --> 00:05:26,917
I'm helping him come to terms
with it.

141
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,041
Jodi's very sweet,

142
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,959
but it is kind of like
living with a parrot.

143
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,041
What? It's true.

144
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:36,041
So she's supposed to just
carry the baby, deliver it,

145
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,041
and then he just gets to
take the kid and go?

146
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,500
That does sound
pretty harsh.

147
00:05:39,542 --> 00:05:41,000
Jodi won't even remember
it's her kid.

148
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,166
That's not gonna
matter to the kid.

149
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,500
Not for a while, anyway.

150
00:05:43,542 --> 00:05:45,417
A child needs a mother
to bond to.

151
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:46,500
Yeah, but they don't need
to be traumatized.

152
00:05:46,542 --> 00:05:48,750
What about
what a wife needs?

153
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:51,083
I mean, Zach can't just
abandon her.

154
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:52,959
People have left for less.

155
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,208
He's--he's just angry.
Just a phase.

156
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,208
She's all alone. He has
an obligation. He married her.

157
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,333
I love you, Addie,
but you're not really gonna

158
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:04,875
preach about the sanctity
of marriage, are you?

159
00:06:04,917 --> 00:06:06,417
Rude.

160
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,417
What if she had cancer?
You think he'd walk out then?

161
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,834
This is different. Cancer is
often a death sentence.

162
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:13,041
Zach is living life
without parole.

163
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,041
And there's a third life
to consider here.

164
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,166
Sheldon, in many, many months
of talking to Zach,

165
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:19,000
he never once said
that he wanted to leave.

166
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,417
But now suddenly,
talking to you--

167
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:22,041
I'm certain Zach contemplated
leaving long before today.

168
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,834
And I imagine he actually
would've told you

169
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,375
if you hadn't confused
your own convictions

170
00:06:26,417 --> 00:06:27,875
with a patient's needs.

171
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,959
Maybe he's in
an angry phase, too.

172
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,417
Hi, Mason.
I'm Dr. Freedman.

173
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,083
Okay.

174
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,041

175
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,583

176
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,166

00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:58,041
Seadra hp70...

180
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,709
Attacks...

181
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,625
With smokescreen
and razor wing?

182
00:07:01,667 --> 00:07:03,250
Yeah, see?
Stick out your tongue.

183
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:04,750
Stick it out. Ahh.
Ahh.

184
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:06,125
Ahh.

185
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:07,417
Okay.

186
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,041
Mom says it's not allowed.

187
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,208
It is when the doctor asks.

188
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,625
So if the doctor asks me
to say "crap"--

189
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:14,625
Mason.

190
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:15,750
I'm just saying.

191
00:07:15,792 --> 00:07:17,834
When was his last exam?

192
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,709
A while ago.

193
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,417
It's expensive
without insurance.

194
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:22,500
Yeah.

195
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:24,250
Mason,

196
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,542
I'm just gonna take
a little blood.

197
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:26,625
Ooh.

198
00:07:26,667 --> 00:07:27,875
Can you, um...

199
00:07:27,917 --> 00:07:29,959
Show me seadra again...

200
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,333
Real quick?

201
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,792
It's gone.
Hmm.

202
00:07:36,834 --> 00:07:38,458
How'd you do that?

203
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,959
Magic?

204
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:43,875
It didn't even hurt.

205
00:07:43,917 --> 00:07:45,041
Good.

206
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:47,000
Cool.

207
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,291
So where's my card?

208
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:49,917
You should check
your pocket, man.

209
00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:53,500
Whoa.

210
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,208
I need you to choose.

211
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,125
Okay.
Yeah, it's bedding.

212
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:04,041
Bedding?
Yeah.

213
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,291
I mean, there's your bedding,
and there's my bedding,

214
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,291
but I thought
it would be nice

215
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,333
if--if we had
our bedding.

216
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:11,542
Really?

217
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,041
Yeah. Actually, no.

218
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,417
Uh, our sheets are ratty,
and there was a sale.

219
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,041
But I-I tried to be romantic.

220
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:19,083
Yes, i-i...
But then you had to come in...

221
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,542
Called you on it.
And call me on it.

222
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,542
Mm-hmm.

223
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:24,542
And that was uncool,
so just choose.

224
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:25,792
Fine.

225
00:08:25,834 --> 00:08:27,291
Uh...

226
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,709
Green.

227
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,792
Can't you be a little bit
more enthusiastic about it?

228
00:08:30,834 --> 00:08:32,417
I'm sorry. I just--
would you leave me

229
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,041
the minute I have a baby
if I had a brain injury?

230
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:37,041
What--what--
what's wrong with your brain?

231
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,583
No, not my brain.
My patient's brain.

232
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:40,709
I'm fixated.

233
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,375
Wait. Did you just ask me
if I was gonna leave you

234
00:08:42,417 --> 00:08:43,834
when you have your baby?

235
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:46,166
No, Sam. I'm not talking
about us.

236
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,667
I was--i am...

237
00:08:47,709 --> 00:08:49,625
Worried about my patient.

238
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:50,875
Okay?

239
00:08:50,917 --> 00:08:53,000
By the way,
I'm not even pregnant, so...

240
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:55,041
Well, was that
a-a possibility,

241
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,625
you being pregnant?

242
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:58,000
No. I haven't started yet.

243
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,208
Started...

244
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,875
Fertility drugs.
Right.

245
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:03,250
Whatever. You know, I wasn't
talking about us, so...

246
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,583
Okay. Okay.

247
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:08,417
Uh, Addison...

248
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:11,041
Are you--are you worried,
uh, that I'm gonna leave you--

249
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,750
no. Sam, come on.

250
00:09:12,792 --> 00:09:14,792
I chose. Green.

251
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:16,250
Get out.

252
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,500
Okay.

253
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,250
Okay, I am gonna
tell you something

254
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,250
that has the potential
to make you angry.

255
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,583
But it--it--it shouldn't.

256
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:27,917
I mean, I understand
why it could,

257
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:29,875
but it--it could also
be great, amazing.

258
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:32,417
And I realize it's gonna
change things--
just say it already.

259
00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:35,041
I have a son.

260
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:37,208
Mason. He's 8.

261
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,583
Uh...
There was this woman,

262
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,792
and we were together
nine years ago.

263
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:44,709
And it was--
it was one night, and--

264
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,041
and she got pregnant.

265
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:49,458
Uh, her name
is Erica Warner.

266
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,750
Y-You were only together
one night,

267
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:54,709
and you trust this Erica
because...

268
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,917
The minute I saw him,
I knew.

269
00:09:57,959 --> 00:09:59,625
I mean...

270
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:02,333
He's a mini Cooper.

271
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,458
Did you take
a paternity test?

272
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,417
Uh...

273
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,458
A woman shows up,

274
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,959
tells you you're the father
of her 8-year-old child,

275
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,458
and you just
take her word for it?

276
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,667
Cooper...

277
00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:17,083
You're an idiot.

278
00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:20,625
I married an idiot.

279
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,667
Hey, I was just coming
to talk to you.

280
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:29,959
And somehow I anticipated that
and decided to leave.

281
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,166
Sheldon,
I resent the implication--

282
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,542
the very public implication--

283
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,041
that I cannot be impartial
with my patients.

284
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,041
I'm sorry.
Thank you.

285
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,125
I am sorry.
That was rude of me.

286
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,250
But since
we're being reasonable,

287
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,250
why don't we discuss
the public implication

288
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,792
that I would assert
to my patient

289
00:10:42,834 --> 00:10:45,375
what he should or shouldn't do
with regard to his marriage?

290
00:10:45,417 --> 00:10:47,542
Fine. I am sorry.

291
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,041
Thank you.

292
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,542
Just one more thing.

293
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,250
Did you even entertain the idea

294
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,166
that Zach could talk to you
about leaving Jodi

295
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,792
because it's easier
for him to talk to a man?

296
00:10:56,834 --> 00:10:58,542
Violet, I don't want
to discuss this with you.

297
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,417
But I knew
Zach and Jodi before.

298
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,208
They--they came to me
for infertility,

299
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,000
which, as you know,
can destroy a couple.

300
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,750
But they never blamed
one another,

301
00:11:05,792 --> 00:11:07,083
the never gave up
on one another.

302
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,083
They were really,
truly in love.

303
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,792
And you never got
to see that.

304
00:11:10,834 --> 00:11:13,500
I read your notes, Violet,
your very sparse notes.

305
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:15,041
So that's all I had to go on.

306
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,041
I'm updating my notes,
Sheldon.

307
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:19,625
Well, that's helpful. Late,
but helpful. So thank you.

308
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:21,041
Well, how the hell was I
supposed to know

309
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:22,041
you were gonna take over
my patients?

310
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,208
You just gotta
keep on walking, Sheldon.

311
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,750
Excuse me?
Pete--

312
00:11:24,792 --> 00:11:26,625
I'm saying, she's like
a dog with a bone.

313
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:28,208
She won't stop,
so at some point,

314
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,041
you just gotta keep on walking.

315
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:34,041
Are you okay?

316
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,041
Uh, he's in anger.

317
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,333
It's a, uh...

318
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:40,208
It's a necessary phase.
He'll move through it.

319
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,041
It can't be easy,
being the target, though.

320
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,000
I...

321
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:49,041
Zach's feelings are--
are cyclical, Sheldon.

322
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,041
He does not want to leave.

323
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:52,041
Violet...

324
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,750
Perhaps I wasn't clear.

325
00:11:53,792 --> 00:11:55,750
As long as your license
is suspended,

326
00:11:55,792 --> 00:11:57,667
Zach is not your patient.

327
00:11:57,709 --> 00:11:59,250
He's mine.

328
00:12:12,542 --> 00:12:13,834
Yeah, right.

329
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,041
Yeah.

330
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,291
So imagine
this scenario--

331
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,417
a woman shows up
out of nowhere

332
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:21,250
and tells a guy that
he's got an 8-year-old son.

333
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:22,583
Ooh.

334
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,083
When Jodi goes into labor,

335
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,041
what risk does her
brain injury pose?

336
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,500
Mm. Fluid may build up
during delivery,

337
00:12:27,542 --> 00:12:29,875
increasing the pressure
in her brain.

338
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,875
If you're asking, I should
be in there with you.

339
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,834
What--Cooper has a kid?

340
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,500
What?

341
00:12:35,542 --> 00:12:38,041
No.
How'd you find out?

342
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,417
Sam texted me.
Mine's from Sheldon.

343
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,041
Cooper and his big mouth.

344
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,083
Oh, my god.
Did you hear?

345
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,250
Yeah.

346
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:44,625
Oh, Cooper's gonna be
a great dad.

347
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:46,875
That is a stupid thing
to say.

348
00:12:46,917 --> 00:12:48,875
Mason is this kid's name,

349
00:12:48,917 --> 00:12:50,041
and, you know, she says

350
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:54,250
that he wanted
to meet his, uh... me.

351
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,083
I'm supposed to believe he's
the only one she slept with?

352
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,625
So how's that gonna work?

353
00:12:57,667 --> 00:12:59,083
She probably just
looked up the guy she screwed,

354
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:02,041
saw that Cooper was a doctor,
and bingo--names him daddy.

355
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,083
Cooper's a sucker.

356
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,041
Would it really kill you
to be its other mommy?

357
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,041
Might kill the kid.

358
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,250
Everybody just
slow the hell down.

359
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,166
We don't even really know
if this is Cooper's child.

360
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:11,166
Paternity test.

361
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,083
Okay?

362
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,959
Oh, I know, but, you guys,
this kid--

363
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,750
he's got my hair,
he's got my eyes,

364
00:13:15,792 --> 00:13:17,041
he's got my sense of humor.

365
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,792
It's--
you really think
she'd lie to him?

366
00:13:18,834 --> 00:13:20,041
Yeah,
she'd lie to him.

367
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,166
And the other thing is...

368
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,083
She never forgot my name.

369
00:13:25,417 --> 00:13:27,125
We did it once, nine years ago,
back of her car.

370
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:29,500
Once, and she remembers me.

371
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,750
That's gotta say something.

372
00:13:31,792 --> 00:13:34,041
I'm just saying.

373
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,250
What?

374
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,041
Everything okay?

375
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:43,208
It's great.
Everything's great.

376
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:49,375
Uh, I know it's none of
my business, but...

377
00:13:49,417 --> 00:13:51,041
I get it.

378
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,583
There's this kid
that you wish would disappear,

379
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,500
and that makes you feel guilty,

380
00:13:55,542 --> 00:13:58,208
and worse, he could end up
being a part of your life

381
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:01,041
even though he's not yours

382
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:04,083
and you didn't ask for him.

383
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:06,166
You do have a choice,
you know?

384
00:14:07,792 --> 00:14:09,041
I made my choice, Sam,

385
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,208
months ago.

386
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,041
I chose Cooper.

387
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,834
That means
taking whatever comes

388
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,625
together...

389
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:18,333
Unfortunately.

390
00:14:19,834 --> 00:14:22,458
♪ is it really
that much sweeter ♪

391
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,000
♪ on the other end ♪

392
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,208
So what is he like?

393
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,041
He's, like, nerdy but cool,

394
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:29,959
and he's smart, cute,
fresh-mouthed.

395
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,667
He's basically me.

396
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:34,750
You do not have to worry
about me.

397
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:36,166
You seem so excited,

398
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,208
and if you--if you took
the paternity test,

399
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,792
then you would know.

400
00:14:39,834 --> 00:14:42,041
So why don't you
just take it?

401
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,750
I have no blood relatives.

402
00:14:43,792 --> 00:14:45,750
And... for the first time
in my life,

403
00:14:45,792 --> 00:14:47,834
I look at Mason, I see...

404
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:50,000
My hair, my eyes.

405
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:52,375
I look at Mason,
I see my biological son.

406
00:14:52,417 --> 00:14:54,041
I get it.

407
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,083
I know blood doesn't matter.

408
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:59,041
I mean, I have
an amazing family.

409
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,333
♪ Well, I ain't that... ♪

410
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:01,250
But...

411
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,041
♪ Special someone ♪

412
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,583
You need to think he's yours
just a little while longer

413
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,625
just in case he's not.

414
00:15:07,667 --> 00:15:11,083
♪ Someone who makes two
become one ♪

415
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,667
♪ I'm already yours ♪

416
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:17,041
And I know
it's only been three days--

417
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,041
almost three days--
but it's three days sober,

418
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,041
which is a start, right?

419
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,250
Right.

420
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,709
Okay.
What's going on?

421
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,917
What?

422
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:27,041
You're keeping a secret,
aren't you?

423
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:30,709
We all download to you,

424
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,208
but just once, you need
to let it out, don't you?

425
00:15:34,917 --> 00:15:37,041
I want to strangle Violet.

426
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:40,041
Well, you better hurry
before Pete does it.

427
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,041
Sorry. Continue.

428
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:44,041
She can't stop micromanaging

429
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,041
and--and telling me
how to treat Zach

430
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,125
and--and prodding me
for details of the case.

431
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:50,208
Well, have you told her
to back off?
Yes.

432
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,041
And did she back off?
Yeah.

433
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,208
So what's the problem?

434
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,041
She's Violet.
She's not done.

435
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:58,041

436
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,792

Really?

439
00:16:04,834 --> 00:16:06,792
Oh, shut up.
No, I mean, you're a surgeon?

440
00:16:06,834 --> 00:16:09,041
People let you cut them open?

441
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,041
Fine.

442
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,750
You try it.

443
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,041
What's so funny?

444
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,500
Let's see. Time of death--

445
00:16:20,542 --> 00:16:23,291
all right. Go. Thank you.

446
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,709
Oh.

447
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,041
Oh, don't look at me
like that.

448
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,291
We were just...

449
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:35,041
Forget it.

450
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,500
So I'm about to overstep.

451
00:16:36,542 --> 00:16:38,041
You think I'm crazy

452
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:40,917
for trying to compartmentalize
having a baby

453
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,125
and a relationship with Sam.

454
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,166
N-No. I wanted to talk
about Zach and Jodi.

455
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:46,083
Oh.

456
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,583
So Zach is making
a mistake,

457
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,792
and I would tell him that

458
00:16:50,834 --> 00:16:52,792
if the law didn't prohibit me
from speaking to him,

459
00:16:52,834 --> 00:16:56,750
and Sheldon's not gonna tell him
that he's doing anything wrong.

460
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:02,208
Oh. You want me...

461
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,250
To convince Zach

462
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,000
to stay with Jodi?

463
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:13,834
I used to make fun
of Jodi and her lists.

464
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,333
Even before the accident,

465
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:19,041
there was a pad
in every room.

466
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,834
Now the post-its are...
Helpful.

467
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,125
And so are you.

468
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,458
Being here for her,
loving her--

469
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,375
it helps.

470
00:17:27,417 --> 00:17:29,417
Zach, is there...

471
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:32,166
Is there any way you don't
have to leave completely?

472
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,041
I didn't sign up
for this.

473
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:35,375
Yeah, but isn't that
the point?

474
00:17:35,417 --> 00:17:37,500
We sign up, we never know

475
00:17:37,542 --> 00:17:39,583
what we're gonna get,
but you...

476
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,917
You stay, you stick it out.

477
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:45,166
You want to know
what staying looks like?

478
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,041
Jodi...

479
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,250
Honey, you're pregnant.

480
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,041
What?
That's amazing.

481
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,208
Yeah.

482
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,041
But I'm leaving you,

483
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,166
and I'm taking the baby.

484
00:17:57,208 --> 00:18:00,041
Y-You can't.
I-I can't live without you.

485
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,041
And the baby, our--
Zach.

486
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,041
My baby...
This is what it's like,

487
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,041
Dr. Montgomery, every day,

488
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,041
over and over.

489
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:09,333
Jodi.

490
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,291
Hmm?
Honey, you're pregnant.

491
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:14,875
But I'm taking the baby
and I'm leaving you.

492
00:18:14,917 --> 00:18:15,875
All right, Zach,
stop it.

493
00:18:15,917 --> 00:18:17,083
This is my life.

494
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,917
And I hate myself.

495
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:20,917
I-I hate who I've become,
because living like this

496
00:18:20,959 --> 00:18:22,125
has made me hate her.

497
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:25,208
My wife has become
my child.

498
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,250
Doesn't that change
the rules?

499
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:28,667
I want our kid to have
a normal life,

500
00:18:28,709 --> 00:18:31,041
and how is that possible
with Jodi...

501
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,041
I can't
take care of them both.

502
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,041
I just... I can't.

503
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,041
Okay, look,
somewhere...

504
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,542
Inside of there
is the woman that you love.

505
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:43,041
I mean, you have to stop.
You're hurting her.

506
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,250
Why? She won't remember.

507
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,166
Zach, I...

508
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,875
I-I don't know
what's happening.

509
00:18:49,917 --> 00:18:52,250
Jodi, you're okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

510
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,709
Who are you?

511
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,583
I'm Dr. Montgomery,
and you're having a baby.

512
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:05,458
No!

513
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,875
What the hell
is happening to me?

514
00:19:06,917 --> 00:19:08,959
You're having a baby, Jodi.
You don't remember

515
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,917
because you were
in an accident.

516
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:11,041
Pulse pressure's widening.

517
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,709
Where's Zach?

518
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,750
I need Zach. Dr. Turner,
where is my husband?

519
00:19:15,792 --> 00:19:17,000
Zach will be here
very soon.

520
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,917
It hurts.
Why does it hurt?

521
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:23,208
You are having...
A baby.

522
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,041
Who are you?

523
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,583
That's Dr. Montgomery.
She's gonna deliver your baby.

524
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,542
What baby? Where's Zach?

525
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:30,792
Jodi, I need you to push.

526
00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:32,500
Ah! I can't. It--it hurts.

527
00:19:32,542 --> 00:19:34,959
No. I'm--I'm scared.

528
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,750
Her heart rate's dropping.
It's a cushion reflex.

529
00:19:37,792 --> 00:19:39,166
It's a sign that there's
a critical rise in her I.C.P.

530
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,834
I want Zach!

531
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,500
He came to the hospital.
I haven't seen him since.

532
00:19:45,542 --> 00:19:46,750
Did you talk to him?

533
00:19:46,792 --> 00:19:48,041
Yes, I tried.
But he's made up his mind.

534
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,834
Oh, this is Sheldon's fault.

535
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:52,041
I'm sure he was trying
to do the right thing.
Okay, you know what?

536
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:54,041
I am legally blocked
from talking to Zach,

537
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,667
but you can talk to him again.

538
00:19:55,709 --> 00:19:57,667
And--and the great thing about
you not being a therapist is,

539
00:19:57,709 --> 00:19:59,208
you can say
whatever the hell you want.

540
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,875
You--you can yell at him,
you can shame him,

541
00:20:00,917 --> 00:20:02,250
you--you can--you can say
e-every messed up thing

542
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:04,250
that you ever wanted to say
to any guy who abandoned you

543
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:07,041
or didn't show up for you,
but get him back in here,

544
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,041
because his wife
needs him, now.

545
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,041
I'll get it. Okay, Jodi.

546
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,166
Can you breathe?
Can you look at me?
I can't. I can't.

547
00:20:16,834 --> 00:20:18,041
Hey.
Hey.

548
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,041
So, um, he doesn't know
who you are,

549
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,875
and I'm not ready
for him to know,

550
00:20:21,917 --> 00:20:23,291
so you take it slow?

551
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:24,709
I-I will.

552
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,041
You're just the doctor,
right?

553
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,166
Yeah.

554
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,583
Hey, look who I found.

555
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:29,709
Dr. Freedman.

556
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,291
What are you doing here?

557
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,709
I get junk food 'cause I
let you take my blood.

558
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,834
Well, you didn't
really let me, but okay.

559
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:37,834
So what are you
doing here?

560
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:39,041
I love junk food.

561
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,667
See, mom, he eats it
and he's a doctor.

562
00:20:41,709 --> 00:20:43,166
Yeah, I'm sure
he doesn't do it often.

563
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,834
No, no, your mom's right.
It's not good for you.

564
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,583
And I-I don't come here
all the time.

565
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:47,709
Just to celebrate.

566
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,917
And, uh,

567
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:51,000
don't tell
my other patients, okay?

568
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,041
So what flavors
did you get?

569
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,417
Oh, I got vanilla,
chocolate, and strawberry.

570
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:56,625
Can I have the strawberry?

571
00:20:56,667 --> 00:20:59,041
Strawberry's
my favorite, too.

572
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,625
Y-You're never
gonna believe this.

573
00:21:20,667 --> 00:21:22,250
You have another kid.

574
00:21:23,792 --> 00:21:25,750
You know how I dip my fries
in my shake,

575
00:21:25,792 --> 00:21:27,291
and it drives you crazy?

576
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,875
Mason dipped his fry, same way,
except here's the thing--

577
00:21:29,917 --> 00:21:31,166
it wasn't just any shake.

578
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:33,250
I bought
all three major flavors.

579
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,333
And do you know
which one he picked?

580
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:36,333
Do you?

581
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,542
Strawberry.

582
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,709
What kid doesn't pick
chocolate or vanilla?!

583
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,000
D--

584
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:46,792
my kid. That's who.

585
00:21:46,834 --> 00:21:49,500
I mean, he's so my kid.

586
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:51,542
I'm gonna go
to the toy store later.

587
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:53,542
Erica said Mason
doesn't have a lot of toys.

588
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:55,500
I don't think...

589
00:21:55,542 --> 00:21:57,500
They have a lot of money,
really.

590
00:21:57,542 --> 00:21:58,792
What do you think?

591
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:00,917
Whatever you think,
Coop.

592
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:12,041
What the hell are you doing
out here?

593
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:14,333
Jodi's in labor.
She's scared and confused.

594
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,041
You think
you have to tell me that?

595
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:18,041
The baby is coming now,
Zach.

596
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:21,500
And Jodi, the unlucky one
who suffered the brain injury

597
00:22:21,542 --> 00:22:23,125
and has carried your child
for the last nine months,

598
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:24,917
is about to deliver.

599
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:27,417
And she's not gonna understand,
Zach, why it feels like

600
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:29,417
her insides
are being torn apart.

601
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:30,917
She's gonna be

602
00:22:30,959 --> 00:22:33,000
even more petrified
and confused and alone.

603
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:34,333
She's not alone.

604
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:36,375
You'll be there,
and Dr. Turner will be there.

605
00:22:36,417 --> 00:22:37,750
No, don't, Zach.

606
00:22:37,792 --> 00:22:39,250
She is alone, okay?

607
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,875
The whole hospital could be
there, and she'd still be alone,

608
00:22:41,917 --> 00:22:43,875
because there's only one person
who can make her not feel alone.

609
00:22:43,917 --> 00:22:46,417
There's only one person who can
calm her down, and that is you.

610
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:48,458
So if you ever loved Jodi,

611
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,875
for the next 12 hours,

612
00:22:49,917 --> 00:22:51,875
be the man
you promised her to be.

613
00:22:51,917 --> 00:22:53,959
Be there for her.

614
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,583
All right, and then--
then you can go.

615
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:21,208
You asked me to come.

616
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,834
What do you want to know?

617
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:25,583
Well, you can start
by explaining

618
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:27,417
why you didn't tell Cooper
about Mason.

619
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:32,417
I was young.
I liked to party.

620
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:34,583
I was tending bar,
and we did it in my car.

621
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:36,583
I know that sounds bad,
but--

622
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:39,917
you think Cooper
was my first?

623
00:23:39,959 --> 00:23:43,083
Well, a month or so later,
I realized I was pregnant.

624
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:46,041
And I thought about calling.

625
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:48,041
But I was scared.

626
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:50,083
Well, somehow getting knocked
up's always a woman's fault.

627
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:52,041
Right.

628
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:54,041
And if I did call,
and he wasn't that guy,

629
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:57,417
then we would've been stuck
in each other's lives, and...

630
00:23:57,458 --> 00:23:59,041
So why show up now?

631
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,041
I'm here for my son,

632
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:04,834
not for me.

633
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:10,417

Jodi, Jodi, I need
you to stay calm, okay?

710
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,041
For you and for the baby.

711
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:26,166
What baby? I-I need Zach.

712
00:27:26,208 --> 00:27:28,083
I'm right here.
Oh, oh.

713
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:30,041
Pl-please don't leave me.

714
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:31,583
I'm not going anywhere.

715
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:33,959
Zach, I need her
to push now.

716
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,125
Okay, you hear that, honey?

717
00:27:35,166 --> 00:27:37,083
You're having a baby.

718
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:39,083
You need to push.
You can do this.

719
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:41,125
I-I can't. I can't.
It hurts. It hurts, Zach.

720
00:27:41,166 --> 00:27:43,709
Please.
Okay, hey, I remember
walking over to the table

721
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:46,500
and being annoyed that
it wasn't even my section,

722
00:27:46,542 --> 00:27:49,208
but I came over, and the only
face I saw was yours.

723
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,750
I can't, Zach. Please.

724
00:27:51,792 --> 00:27:54,041
Look into my eyes.
Look at me.

725
00:27:54,083 --> 00:27:56,041
And I was trying
to write down all the orders,

726
00:27:56,083 --> 00:27:58,125
but my hands,
they were shaking so much.

727
00:27:58,166 --> 00:27:59,959
And I knew then
at that exact moment

728
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,041
that I was totally
and completely in love with you.

729
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:05,500
But I was too scared
to ask you out.

730
00:28:05,542 --> 00:28:07,959
And so you came into
the restaurant

731
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,208
every week for two months

732
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:11,959
and you sat in my section.

733
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,458
Yeah.

734
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,125
And on the busiest night of
the year, 300 reservations...

735
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:16,542
You asked me out.

736
00:28:16,583 --> 00:28:17,792
Pressure's coming down.

737
00:28:17,834 --> 00:28:19,250
Her heart rate's normalizing.

738
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:21,041
Zach, I need her to push.

739
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:23,250
Okay, Jodi, honey,
we are having a baby.

740
00:28:23,291 --> 00:28:24,542
You trust me?

741
00:28:24,583 --> 00:28:26,041
Yeah.
Okay.

742
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:27,542
Then you gotta push.

743
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:29,166
Ready?

744
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,875
Good, Jodi. Good.

745
00:28:32,917 --> 00:28:35,208
Okay, one more big push.

746
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:38,166
Dr. Montgomery, we need to
give her the baby right away,

747
00:28:38,208 --> 00:28:39,625
before she forgets.

748
00:28:39,667 --> 00:28:42,041
Hey, Jodi. Big push now.

749
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:43,583
All right?
We're having a baby.

750
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:45,583
In a few seconds,
you're gonna hold our baby.

751
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:47,583
You can do this.
Do it for me. Okay?

752
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:49,041
Come on.

753
00:28:53,083 --> 00:28:55,041
Good, Jodi. Good.

754
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:58,291
You hear that?

755
00:28:59,917 --> 00:29:01,709
Zach...

756
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,208
- We...
- Oh, my god.

757
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,875
We did it.

758
00:29:04,917 --> 00:29:06,291
Our baby.

759
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:08,041
You did it.

760
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:09,458
I love you so much.

761
00:29:10,709 --> 00:29:12,041
Hi.

762
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:15,208
Hi, buddy.

763
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,500
What a beautiful baby.

764
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,041
Whose baby is this?

765
00:29:34,083 --> 00:29:35,458
You know,

766
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,667
the more I think about
my relationship with Violet,

767
00:29:36,709 --> 00:29:38,500
the more I wonder
if it was ever good.

768
00:29:38,542 --> 00:29:39,959
Well, as someone
who competed with you

769
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,500
for Violet's affections,

770
00:29:41,542 --> 00:29:43,500
I can say with certainty that
this is revisionist history.

771
00:29:43,542 --> 00:29:45,458
Right, but she can't stop
shrinking me.

772
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,041
She can't
stop patronizing me.

773
00:29:47,083 --> 00:29:49,041
She can't stop telling me
what phase I'm in.

774
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:51,041
Well, those are just
her defense mechanisms.

775
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:53,041
She has every reason to be
a little defensive

776
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:55,709
these days, you know?

777
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,250
Hey.

778
00:29:58,709 --> 00:30:00,583
What are you doing here?
Uh, Jodi went into labor.

779
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:02,583
She needed
a familiar face around.

780
00:30:02,625 --> 00:30:04,709
I-I held her hand.
That's all.

781
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,583
You're on a very thin line,
Violet.

782
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:09,041
Yes. Well, since you encouraged
her husband to leave her,

783
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:10,583
she needed me
on that thin line.

784
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:11,750
But she's not your patient,
Violet.

785
00:30:11,792 --> 00:30:13,041
So you really have
no business--

786
00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:14,583
no, you have no business,
okay?

787
00:30:14,625 --> 00:30:15,875
You're not in this argument
right now.

788
00:30:15,917 --> 00:30:17,667
You are not a therapist,
so you don't get an opinion.

789
00:30:17,709 --> 00:30:18,792
And if you did need
to have one,

790
00:30:18,834 --> 00:30:20,125
then why don't you take
my side?

791
00:30:20,166 --> 00:30:22,291
Violet, I'm just saying--
you are my husband, Pete.

792
00:30:22,333 --> 00:30:25,500
For one damn minute, be
my husband and take my side.

793
00:30:25,542 --> 00:30:27,041
Wow. Wow.

794
00:30:28,458 --> 00:30:30,792
Who's in the anger phase now?

795
00:30:41,083 --> 00:30:42,417
I know this is hard.

796
00:30:42,458 --> 00:30:44,000
It's not hard, Sheldon.

797
00:30:44,041 --> 00:30:45,792
It's impossible.

798
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:49,208
He's not just angry.
It's like...

799
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,709
It's like he hates me.

800
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,208
And I...

801
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,166
I don't feel like
it's safe to breathe.

802
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,709
I can't... breathe.

803
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:58,000
What are you saying to him?

804
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:01,667
I care about you, Violet.
I'm trying to help you.

805
00:31:01,709 --> 00:31:03,250
But I can't break confidence,

806
00:31:03,291 --> 00:31:05,834
so--so--so stop asking me.

807
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:10,750
I think it was good
that you held Jodi's hand.

808

00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:14,041

00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,375
Yeah, you married an idiot.

886
00:34:13,417 --> 00:34:16,041
I married a miserable bitch.

887
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:19,041
♪♪♪

888
00:34:26,083 --> 00:34:27,041
Hey.

889
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,458
I'm not your therapist,
Pete.

890
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,041
I'm your friend.

891
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:33,500
And since the lines
have already been blurred,

892
00:34:33,542 --> 00:34:35,000
I'm about to cross them.

893
00:34:35,041 --> 00:34:36,041
Say whatever you want.

894
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:37,792
You're being an ass
to Violet.

895
00:34:37,834 --> 00:34:40,000
You say your problem is,
she won't stop shrinking you,

896
00:34:40,041 --> 00:34:42,000
but when does she stop,
when she finally breaks,

897
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:43,709
you--you still
just walk away.

898
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,500
Great. So now
you're on her side.

899
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:47,000
No, it's not about sides.

900
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:49,208
It's about you getting that
you're going to burn down

901
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:51,625
the one thing
you say you care about.

902
00:34:51,667 --> 00:34:53,917
You're burning down
Lucas' happy home.

903
00:34:59,083 --> 00:35:02,458
I don't know how to stop.

904
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,500
I feel like I hate her.

905
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,041
You have a lot of rage.

906
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:12,041
And she's right that
this is a necessary phase.

907
00:35:12,083 --> 00:35:14,959
But you have to find
a new place to direct it.

908
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,041
Pick a new place, Pete,

909
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:19,041
because Violet is flawed...

910
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:20,667
For sure,

911
00:35:20,709 --> 00:35:23,041
but she's not your enemy
and she's not your mother,

912
00:35:23,083 --> 00:35:25,583
and if you drive her away,
if you--

913
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:28,041
if you break Lucas' home,
you...

914
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:31,083
You're on a brink, Pete.

915
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:32,583
You're at a precipice,
and if you go over,

916
00:35:32,625 --> 00:35:34,000
I don't know
if you'd ever make it back.

917
00:35:36,083 --> 00:35:38,709
And you need to get
a therapist.

918
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:42,250
You don't want to hear
from me anymore, huh?

919
00:35:42,291 --> 00:35:43,709
I do want to hear
from you,

920
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,709
but I want to be able
to talk back to you like this,

921
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,166
like a friend,

922
00:35:47,208 --> 00:35:49,959
because you're gonna need
one of those, too.

923
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,959
Go home to your wife,
Pete.

924
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,417
Make yourself remember
the things you love about her.

925
00:36:04,083 --> 00:36:06,041
I want to ask you something

926
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:07,417
as a friend...

927
00:36:07,458 --> 00:36:09,542
A male friend.

928
00:36:09,583 --> 00:36:11,917
Okay.

929
00:36:11,959 --> 00:36:14,041
Fine.

930
00:36:14,083 --> 00:36:16,583
I have other friends
that are men,

931
00:36:16,625 --> 00:36:18,583
you know,
but I just feel like,

932
00:36:18,625 --> 00:36:21,500
given what you do,
you could give me a...

933
00:36:21,542 --> 00:36:23,041
Male perspective on it,

934
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:26,750
but also understand
the female part of it, too.

935
00:36:26,792 --> 00:36:29,000
Am I making any sense?

936
00:36:29,041 --> 00:36:30,375
Sort of.

937
00:36:30,417 --> 00:36:32,208
Do you want to just
ask me the question?

938
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,750
Yes, I do.

939
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:36,542
No, I-I do, but...

940
00:36:36,583 --> 00:36:38,041
I want to say things to you

941
00:36:38,083 --> 00:36:40,166
that I haven't even said
to Sam,

942
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:42,458
and that feels
a little weird

943
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,041
because...

944
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:47,041
I-I don't know anything
about you.

945
00:36:47,083 --> 00:36:49,041
Well, if it makes it
any easier,

946
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:50,875
you can--
you can ask me anything.

947
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:56,000
Or I can just tell you.

948
00:36:57,041 --> 00:37:00,041
I am the oldest of four,
three sisters.

949
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:04,333
Father left when I was 9.
Mother died when I was 18.

950
00:37:04,375 --> 00:37:06,000
College had to wait

951
00:37:06,041 --> 00:37:08,875
because I didn't want
to split up my family.

952
00:37:08,917 --> 00:37:11,500
So I worked three jobs--
bike courier, bellman,

953
00:37:11,542 --> 00:37:13,583
short-order cook.

954
00:37:13,625 --> 00:37:16,041
At one point,
I even sold my sperm.

955
00:37:16,083 --> 00:37:18,041
Probably not a genius move,

956
00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:20,041
given Cooper's
current predicament,

957
00:37:20,083 --> 00:37:22,083
but I did what I had to do.

958
00:37:22,125 --> 00:37:25,000
I had a free ride to college,
put myself through med school.

959
00:37:25,041 --> 00:37:27,458
There have been
a lot of women.

960
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,041
But I've really only
been in love once.

961
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:35,041
So now you know me.

962
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:39,041
Okay.

963
00:37:39,083 --> 00:37:43,667

I can also tell you what
