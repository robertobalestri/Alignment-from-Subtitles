♪ Ohhh ohhh ohhh ♪

2
00:00:06,959 --> 00:00:08,917
He does this kind of
amazing thing with his tongue.

3
00:00:10,208 --> 00:00:12,083
I mean, i'm, you know,
a woman in my 40s.

4
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:14,917
I've had my share of sex.

5
00:00:14,959 --> 00:00:16,959
I've had some...

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,041
Pretty spectacular...

7
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:21,583
You know.

8
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:23,125
I've had sex, okay?

9
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:26,667
But Sam is this, like...

10
00:00:26,709 --> 00:00:29,834
I don't know. Maybe it's because
I'm in love with him.

11
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:32,041
No, I don't think it's because
I'm in love with him.

12
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:33,458
You know,
I was in love with Derek.

13
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,959
I was in love with Mark,

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,041
I think,
even for a little while.

15
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:41,083
No, I think...

16
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,750
It's because
Sam's better than me.

17
00:00:45,792 --> 00:00:48,000
He's a better person.

18
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:54,208
A genuinely good person.

19
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,000
You don't think
you're a good person?

20
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:02,417
Or maybe it's just that thing
he does with his tongue.

21
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,750
I woke up with a hangover
this morning.

22
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,667
Again.

23
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:17,041
And I'm just...

24
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:20,500
I'm over it.

25
00:01:20,542 --> 00:01:23,041
This has to be it.

26
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,875
I don't know why
I was able to put together

27
00:01:24,917 --> 00:01:26,041
almost a decade sober,

28
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:29,083
and now I can't seem to make it
past about 30 days.

29
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:31,625
This program gave me a life,

30
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:35,041
and now I have
a lot to lose, and, uh...

31
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:37,750
So I'm not drinking today.

32
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:41,291
Phew.

33
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:44,208
I can't believe
it is day one again.

34
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:49,959
I'm humiliated.

35
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:58,041
I'm humiliated
that it's day one again.

36
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:00,000
Um...

37
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:06,083
But, you know, it's one day
at a time, and, uh...

38
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,959
And I'm not gonna
take a drink today.

39
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:12,417
Thanks.

40
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:17,458
Sorry that I didn't get a chance

41
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,291
to review your case with
Dr. Reilly before the consult.

42
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:22,750
He has been so amazing.

43
00:02:22,792 --> 00:02:25,917
He's really made me believe
having a child is possible,

44
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:27,875
despite what
the other doctors said.

45
00:02:27,917 --> 00:02:30,875
Nina's been chasing that miracle
since her mother died last year.

46
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:34,000
Well,
let's take a look.

47
00:02:35,834 --> 00:02:37,208
Okay.

48
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,417
Oh. It says here you were born
without a uterus?

49
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:44,333
Yeah. I have Mayer-rokitansky-
kuster-hauser syndrome.

50
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,208
It's a mouthful, right?

51
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,959
Ha, ha. But her ovaries
are functional.

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,208
That's the important part.
Right, but you understand--

53
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,041
I mean, Dr. Reilly
explained to you

54
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,709
that you can't
get pregnant?

55
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,083
You have to have a uterus
to carry a child.

56
00:02:57,125 --> 00:03:00,041
I know. That's why gammy
is giving me hers.

57
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,500
Mm-hm.

58
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:11,625
He's been waking up
a lot at night,

59
00:03:11,667 --> 00:03:13,625
and, uh, he's a little fussier
than usual.

60
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:16,208
Mm-hm.
Any fever or runny nose?

61
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,667
No.
But he was pulling his ear.

62
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:20,875
What if he perfed his eardrum?
He could go deaf.

63
00:03:20,917 --> 00:03:23,875
Eardrums are fine,
and he is fine.

64
00:03:23,917 --> 00:03:26,041
And you are...

65
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,250
I-- ha, ha.

66
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:31,375
Well, I, um...

67
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:35,125
I may be going a teensy bit
crazy from all the mommy-ness.

68
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,041
But it's a good crazy.

69
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,041
I have never had
the chance really, you know,

70
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:44,041
to be at home all the time
alone with my 2-year-old son.

71
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,458
So it's a good crazy.

72
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,208
And, you know,
then there's Pete.

73
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,792
My husband
had a heart attack.

74
00:03:49,834 --> 00:03:51,583
I mean,
listen to that sentence, Coop.

75
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,041
My husband
had a heart attack.

76
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:57,458
My handsome, studly,
virile husband.

77
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,792
You know
what I think I need?

78
00:03:59,834 --> 00:04:01,875
I think I need
a little perspective.

79
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:04,667
You know, from people
who are doing what I'm doing.

80
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:06,041
Mommies.

81
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:09,041
Do you know any cool mommies
with groups? Mommy groups?

82
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,166
Okay, first of all,
stop saying "mommy."

83
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,583
Second, are you sure
that that's what you want?

84
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:17,041
Yes, yes. I think it would be
interesting and fun, and--

85
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:21,709
come on, Cooper. Tell me
where the cool mommies are.

86
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,041
I haven't been able to sleep
since my heart attack.

87
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,208
Meditation, self-hypnosis.

88
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,917
You call the therapists
I recommended?

89
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:30,041
Why would I waste my time
talking to a total stranger?

90
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,709
I know you.
I trust you.

91
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,041
I'm flattered.
You're free.

92
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:35,959
Pete--
look, do you know

93
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,250
that a third of all
quadruple bypass patients

94
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,458
are dead within ten years?

95
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,333
Well, those kind of numbers
would keep most people awake.

96
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,291
Look, it's normal
to feel scared.

97
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,625
I'm not scared.
I'm pissed.

98
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:48,041
I did everything right.

99
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:49,792
I never smoked,
I exercise,

100
00:04:49,834 --> 00:04:52,667
I cut way back on red meat
and dairy, decaf.

101
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:56,041
And now I eat broccoli.
I hate broccoli.

102
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,000
How's Violet
handling all this?

103
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,709
Oh, she's terrified.
You can see it in her eyes.

104
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,166
She thinks
I'm gonna drop dead.

105
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,667
Your heart attack
was traumatic for her too.

106
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:07,333
She'll relax
when she's convinced

107
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,041
that the family's
no longer in crisis.

108
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:12,542
When will that be?
When you find another therapist.

109
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,750
Hey, can I get some of that?

110
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:22,166
Really? I've apologized,
like, a thousand times.

111
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:27,041
I am truly, deeply,
incredibly sorry, Charlotte.

112
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:29,333
What's going on now?
I--

113
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:32,041
I did a thing.
A stupid thing.

114
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:36,500
Yes, a stupid thing that ended
up saving a young girl's life.

115
00:05:36,542 --> 00:05:38,917
And that's the very last time
I'll defend myself,

116
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:41,333
but come on, Charlotte,
you can't stay mad at me.

117
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,917
You broke into my computer

118
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:45,291
and stole confidential
information.

119
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,208
Don't bet on it.

120
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,834
Late night?

121
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:55,333
Chief of staff
and curfew police.

122
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:58,834
You're a busy woman.
Good morning.

123
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,250
Or not.

124
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:03,041
Don't mind her. We're all
really happy that you're here.

125
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:06,000
You promised a patient
a uterine transplant?

126
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,458
What the hell
were you thinking?

127
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,041
Nice welcome wagon
you got there.

128
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,583
It can't be done.
I did work at the Mayo clinic

129
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,959
on the procedural viability
of uterine organ transplant.

130
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,041
It can be done.
On animals.

131
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,333
It has been done on a human,

132
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,542
just not with
any long-term success.

133
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,166
Somebody has to be the first.
Sam.

134
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:22,583
Thank you, Sam.

135
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,625
There is always a first.
Nina's a perfect candidate.

136
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:25,875
She's young, healthy.

137
00:06:25,917 --> 00:06:27,583
She is grieving.
Her mother just died.

138
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:28,917
She's not thinking clearly.

139
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:31,709
Look, I'm in no position
to judge her motives.

140
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,667
Where would she get the uterus?
Oh, from her gammy. Yeah.

141
00:06:34,709 --> 00:06:38,041
Her 66-year-old grandmother.
Who's probably not using it.

142
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:41,041
It puts both women through
an unnecessary, risky surgery.

143
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,375
Even if she survives,
Nina would be

144
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:44,291
on anti-rejection meds
for months

145
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:45,917
before you can do
an embryo transfer.

146
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:48,041
And even then, her body
can reject the uterus,

147
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,709
endangering her
and the fetus.

148
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,917
What about the obvious solution?
You skip the surgery and adopt.

149
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:55,667
- Or you use a surrogate.
- That's not what she wants.

150
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:58,458
She wants to give birth
like her mother did her.

151
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,250
It's not my place to judge that.
It's my place

152
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:02,917
to make it happen if I can,
and I can.

153
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:06,458
If this works, we can advance
the science of fertility.

154
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,542
The patient's aware of risks,
she has a donor lined up.

155
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,959
I'll take the shot.
I think it's worth a shot.

156
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,750
You wanna stand in her way,

157
00:07:13,792 --> 00:07:15,041
or do you wanna help her
make a baby

158
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,291
and help make history
in the process?

159
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,750
You increased your dosage
without talking to me?

160
00:07:22,792 --> 00:07:25,041
Well, I wasn't
thinking about you

161
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:27,250
so much as I was
thinking about Eva.

162
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,834
Eva?
She's one of my kindergartners.

163
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,458
She's 5 years old.

164
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,291
Things aren't so great at home
so I spend extra time with her

165
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:39,709
and I was having
a real impact until...

166
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,542
It's hard to explain Parkinson's
to a 5-year-old.

167
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:45,458
My hand started tremoring,
and she was fine with that,

168
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,583
but then the--

169
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,041
but then,
the jerking started,

170
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,542
and then, I froze
in front of her.

171
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:54,041
And that was so scary for her.
It was just awful.

172
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,041
So, yes,
I increased my dosage.

173
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:58,041
But it seems to really
be working because,

174
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,750
you know,
the symptoms decreased.

175
00:07:59,792 --> 00:08:02,041
Okay, but high doses
of your meds

176
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,083
have been known to cause
pretty serious side effects.

177
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:06,583
They affect the limbic system,
which is the area of the brain

178
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,750
that deals with
impulse control.

179
00:08:08,792 --> 00:08:12,291
Have you had any impulsive
or compulsive behaviors?

180
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:16,291
Gambling, risk taking,
anything out of the ordinary?

181
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:19,041
Um...

182
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,917
My husband is having
a checkup with Sam.

183
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,125
He's probably almost done,
right?

184
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:28,291
- Your cortisol levels are way up.
- You're stressed.

185
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:31,709
My 40-year-old wife
has Parkinson's disease.

186
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,917
That's a little stressful.
Yeah, I know.

187
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:35,959
You're doing a great job
of taking care of her.

188
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,542
Now you gotta take
better care of yourself.

189
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:38,709
You exercising?

190
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,500
Yeah, I definitely
keep thinking about it.

191
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,333
Huh.

192
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:48,542
Sam, what is it?
Uh...

193
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:51,959
I'm sorry, will.

194
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,834
I got some bad news.

195
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:59,166
Laura, symptoms I can help.
But I need to know.

196
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,875
Are you having side effects?
Compulsive behavior?

197
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:04,542
Sam says I have gonorrhea.

198
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,166
I haven't had sex
with anyone but you.

199
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,166
Can you say the same?

200
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:13,333
Yes, Dr. Shepherd,
I've been having side effects.

201
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:21,500
It started with a single dad
of one of the kids in my class.

202
00:09:21,542 --> 00:09:25,041
He came in for a parent-teacher
conference and he's--

203
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:27,166
um, he's very handsome.

204
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:30,625
And I noticed he was looking
at my chest while I was talking.

205
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:32,291
The next thing I know,
my hand is on his pants,

206
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,250
and then in his pants,
and then we're doing it

207
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:35,834
in the supply closet
in my classroom

208
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,583
on top of the chalk
and the magic markers.

209
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,417
Wow.
Yeah, so--

210
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,709
I mean, it just--
it was that one time,

211
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:45,458
and I swore
it will never happen again.

212
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,583
Okay. Good.

213
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,166
That's good.
Because we can contact him

214
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,542
and we can have him
treated for--

215
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:53,250
then with the janitor
in his supply closet.

216
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:56,458
And then with the man who came
to fix my dripping faucet.

217
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,041
Your dripping faucet?

218
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,625
The plumber.
Got that.

219
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:04,625
And I just-- do you think
that's where the gonorrhea--?

220
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:05,959
It's hard to say.

221
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,625
This is crazy.
This is not me.

222
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:11,041
I am married to
a wonderful, wonderful man,

223
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,291
and I can't lose him. God,
I never wanted to hurt him.

224
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,458
I can't live with the tremors,
I can't stop grabbing--

225
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,458
got it. Got it.

226
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,041
Okay, let's start with
an std panel and an HIV test,

227
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,959
and then we'll
take it from there.

228
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,083
Okay.

229
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:30,792
She didn't literally say
"the plumber."

230
00:10:30,834 --> 00:10:33,959
He fixed her leaky faucet.

231
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,792
Think it's funny your patient
destroyed a long-term marriage

232
00:10:36,834 --> 00:10:39,458
- with recurrent infidelity?
- It's actually sad.

233
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,333
And I'm hoping
her husband understands

234
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,166
that the drugs changed
her brain chemistry,

235
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,291
which changed
her behavior.

236
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,083
I mean, he can't
hold it against her.

237
00:10:48,792 --> 00:10:50,083
"Hold it against her."

238
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,291
Oh, stop it,
both of you.

239
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,250
So we're saying
infidelity gets excused

240
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:57,000
when drugs are involved?
In this case, yes.

241
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,500
Isn't that like saying

242
00:10:58,542 --> 00:11:01,041
you can't blame a drunk driver
after she totals another car?

243
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:04,083
A drunk driver
chooses to get wasted.

244
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,917
Laura did not choose
Parkinson's.

245
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:07,917
Will can't blame her
for side effects.

246
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:11,041
That doesn't change she was
fooling around with other men.

247
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,834
And you're asking him
to suck it up.

248
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,709
Heh. "Suck it up."

249
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:19,041
Will is devoted to Laura.

250
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,333
And I think
I can save the marriage.

251
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,291
How?
Deep brain stimulation.

252
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:26,792
Why do you always wanna do dbs?
Because it works.

253
00:11:26,834 --> 00:11:29,333
I stimulate the brain, the
Parkinson's symptoms decrease,

254
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,125
and the pornography
is relegated

255
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,792
to Laura and will's
television set.

256
00:11:33,834 --> 00:11:36,041
Dbs is my magic wand.

257
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,667
I just kind of
handed you that one.

258
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:46,667
Hey.
You wanna grab some lunch?

259
00:11:46,709 --> 00:11:48,166
Hmm, I can't.

260
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:51,625
Then do you want
to mess around?

261
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,750
Mm. Yes,

262
00:11:55,792 --> 00:11:58,667
but I have an appointment.

263
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:01,125
That you can't cancel?
That I shouldn't cancel.

264
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,917
I'm-- mm.

265
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:07,083
I'm interviewing
a couple of ivf specialists.

266
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,041
Huh.

267
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,583
Cool.
Ha, ha.

268
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,417
Sam, I didn't mean to--
that's fine.

269
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:13,709
Any other time--

270
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,041
any other time, I would.
I get it.

271
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:19,000
I didn't have a condom
on me anyway, so...

272
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,500
Sam, this is weird.
No, it's fine.

273
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:27,083
You do what you have to do.
And it's-- it's fine. Really.

274
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,000
Yeah?
Mm-hm.

275
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,041
Actually, i'm...

276
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,583
You know,
I'm excited about it.

277
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:35,041
And I know I don't talk to you
about it much,

278
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:37,041
but I could if you want.
No, you don't have to.

279
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,083
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm happy for you.

280
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,291
I am happy for you.
But this is your thing.

281
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,125
And i--
oh, sorry.

282
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:46,041
- Am I, uh, interrupting?
- No.

283
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,667
Well, that's a whole lot
of uterine transplant research

284
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:50,625
for someone who thinks
it's a crazy procedure.

285
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:53,250
I am intellectually curious,
but my opinion hasn't changed.

286
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:54,750
That's a shame
in this case.

287
00:12:54,792 --> 00:12:56,208
The guys on the transplant team,

288
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:00,750
they're fine for the job,
but I'd prefer you.

289
00:13:00,792 --> 00:13:02,875
Listen, Nina's checking
into the hospital tomorrow.

290
00:13:02,917 --> 00:13:04,083
Go talk to her.

291
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,166
If you're not interested,
I'll leave you alone.

292
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,041
Promise?

293
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,667
You hungry?
Yeah.

294
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:19,000
Bonjour.

295
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:21,291
Violet, this is Annette.
She's Daisy's mom.

296
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:24,041
And this is Lynn.
Little Truman is hers.

297
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:28,041
And that handsome boy
is my Leo.

298
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,709
What are you drinking,
red or white?

299
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,166
Don't mind Lynn.
She just stopped breast-feeding,

300
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:34,959
and so she's making up
for lost time.

301
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,041
Truman turned 3
and lost interest.

302
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,041
But we're still
sharing a bed,

303
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:40,792
so the bonding
isn't interrupted.

304
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:42,667
Oh, you don't find that--?

305
00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:44,500
I mean, a family bed,
it's great for bonding,

306
00:13:44,542 --> 00:13:46,208
but it can be a little tricky
to, uh--

307
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,125
for what, a sex life?

308
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:54,000
Honestly, that's not really
on my list of priorities.

309
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:57,041
So tell us about you.

310
00:13:57,083 --> 00:14:00,792
Oh, I'm a-- I'm a psychiatrist
and a writer.

311
00:14:00,834 --> 00:14:02,792
Oh, yeah, we all read your book.
Loved it.

312
00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:04,083
Oh, thank you.

313
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:06,750
Yes. It was actually kind of
painful to get it all out.

314
00:14:06,792 --> 00:14:09,208
And, uh, plus,
I was practicing full-time, so--

315
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,041
did you write it to help
with the preschool apps?

316
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,041
Genius.

317
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:17,000
No, i-- preschool?
Lucas is only 2.

318
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,792
I'm sure that's fine too.

319
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,041
Did Leo make up
with his cousin?

320
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,041
Yeah.
The bite barely broke skin.

321
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:29,625
Leo bit his cousin?
It's just a phase.

322
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:32,834
Actually, not when he's--
how old is he, 5?

323
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:36,208
Most kids outgrow that
by the time they're 3,

324
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,667
so when they're Leo's age,

325
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:40,041
that can be a way
of getting attention

326
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,458
or dealing with stress.

327
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,375
Has he experienced
any trauma lately?

328
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,417
We should get some snacks
for the kids.

329
00:14:50,709 --> 00:14:52,208
I can help.
Oh, no, that's fine.

330
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,250
Uh, why don't you
just wait here?

331
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:06,667
Wow. Comes with a stocked bar.
We made the right hire.

332
00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:08,250
I think your office
is bigger than mine.

333
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,166
Not that I'd wanna
put in a bar.

334
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,917
- Thanks for taking me on.
- And thank you.

335
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,291
Wow. His office
is bigger than yours.

336
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:18,041
And he's got a bar.
Sometimes a woman needs a drink

337
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,500
when you tell her
she's infertile.

338
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:21,458
I know that's a little
unorthodox, but, uh...

339
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,083
We're actually-- we're pretty
relaxed around here.

340
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:27,041
When Pete's not dealing with
his heart attack by yelling.

341
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,291
And Violet's not frustrated
she's still suspended.

342
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,041
And Charlotte's
actually speaking to me.

343
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,041
Yeah.
What'd you do?

344
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,208
Why assume it's my fault?
It usually is.

345
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,125
Jake doesn't know that.
Did you apologize yet?

346
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:38,917
Repeatedly. Of course.
Did you mean it?

347
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,917
- Time for flowers.
- Or dinner.

348
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,041
You guys know I'm married
to Charlotte? Charlotte king?

349
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,834
You know, apologies
make sense to men.

350
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,458
Find the problem,
fix it, right?

351
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,208
That's kind of how we're built.
But, uh, for women,

352
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,917
the words don't
really mean anything

353
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,667
unless they understand you get
where their heads are at.

354
00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:57,041
I mean, relationships are
philosophy to them, not science.

355
00:15:57,083 --> 00:16:00,041
You just gotta get
where Charlotte's coming from.

356
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,875
Oh.
It's how I make my living.

357
00:16:02,917 --> 00:16:04,291
I'm in the business
of knowing women.

358
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,375
- Hmm, yeah.
- Yeah.

359
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,709
Kind of makes you sound
like a pimp, though.

360
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,333
Yeah, it does.
Yeah, a little bit.

361
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,041
Hi.
Hey.

362
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,709
Sorry that took so long.

363
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,375
I had to stop at the toy store
to get some puzzles for Lucas

364
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:25,500
and then I got stuck
on a phone call.

365
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:28,041
I'm trying to get into
a private mommy-and-me class

366
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,458
that has a waiting list.

367
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,083
Where's Lucas?
I put him to bed.

368
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:36,291
According to Sam,
I'm a fully-functional adult.

369
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,709
Fully functional? He said--

370
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,000
I'm cleared
for physical activity.

371
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:46,750
All physical activity?
Mm-hm.

372
00:16:46,792 --> 00:16:48,000
Thank you, god.

373
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:11,417
Who are you, and what have you
done with my husband?

374
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,417
I understand where
you're coming from. I get it.

375
00:17:37,792 --> 00:17:39,500
I get you.

376
00:17:39,542 --> 00:17:41,917
You know, it's a, uh--

377
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:44,291
it's a science,
not a philosophy.

378
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:48,625
I mean, it's a philosophy,
not a science, our relationship.

379
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,917
And I just...

380
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:54,250
I hear you, and I understand.

381
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,500
And I am sorry for everything.

382
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:02,291
What exactly is it
that you understand?

383
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,917
I have no idea.

384
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:11,875
Which is why you're
still sleeping on the couch.

385
00:18:11,917 --> 00:18:13,083
Yeah.

386
00:18:17,542 --> 00:18:20,625
Are you really ready to just
give up on 20 years of marriage

387
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:24,417
without exploring
every other option?

388
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:26,083
Laura loves you.
That hasn't changed.

389
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:29,041
The medication made her--
she had sex with strangers.

390
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:32,208
Do you think the medication
made her lie to me too?

391
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,834
Do you think
it made her betray

392
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:36,041
every single thing
I thought we were about?

393
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,417
I don't know.

394
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,667
I don't know how it affected
her brain chemistry.

395
00:18:39,709 --> 00:18:41,917
I don't know what was medication
and what was choice.

396
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:43,083
But I think...

397
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:49,125
What I'm trying to say
is that illness changes people,

398
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,709
on the inside
and on the out.

399
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:55,417
That's why the marriage vows say
"in sickness and in health."

400
00:18:56,959 --> 00:19:00,041
Now, I'm not saying
it's gonna be easy.

401
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:04,333
What I'm saying is that you
should hear Dr. Shepherd out.

402
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,041
Hi. Can I come in?

403
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:12,458
Hi. Yeah, I was just about
to go buy some flowers.

404
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,709
I'm not gonna be
any great shakes after surgery,

405
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:18,041
so I wanna make sure that Nina
has something nice to look at.

406
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,959
See you later.
Okay.

407
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,625
Anytime I got sick as a kid,

408
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:25,834
my mom cleaned my room
and brought me flowers.

409
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:29,000
I didn't realize that gammy
had done the same for her.

410
00:19:30,542 --> 00:19:34,041
It's a pretty amazing thing
she's gonna do for you.

411
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:36,917
You think I'm crazy.
No. No, I don't.

412
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:38,333
But this is...

413
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:41,125
It's dangerous.
It is an experimental procedure.

414
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,375
You're risking hemorrhaging,
organ rejection,

415
00:19:43,417 --> 00:19:45,041
and this is before
you get to implantation.

416
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,041
I know the risks.

417
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,041
Dr. Reilly laid them all
out for me twice.

418
00:19:50,542 --> 00:19:52,959
When I was younger,
my mom worried all the time.

419
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,041
"Call me when you get there."
"Who are you going with?"

420
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,166
"What time will you be home?"

421
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,041
I just thought
that she was insane.

422
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,125
And every time,
she said to me:

423
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:04,375
"When you're a mother,
you'll understand."

424
00:20:04,417 --> 00:20:07,041
I wanna be so close to someone
that I know them

425
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,250
from the moment they start
growing inside of me.

426
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,208
I want a baby.

427
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,625
My baby.

428
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:17,041
To love
and protect and teach.

429
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,041
So when I read about
Dr. Reilly's research--

430
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,750
it's not a guarantee
that it will work.

431
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:22,667
There are no guarantees
in life.

432
00:20:22,709 --> 00:20:24,041
But if something
is worth having,

433
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,458
you've gotta give it a try,
right?

434
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:30,041
Because if this works,
someday when my kid

435
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:33,583
is driving me
insane with worry,

436
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:36,417
I'll finally understand.

437
00:20:45,709 --> 00:20:47,000
So?

438
00:20:48,542 --> 00:20:50,083
Let's take the shot.

439
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,417
I'll implant where the signals
are generating your tremors.

440
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,875
I'm gonna be awake for this.
Won't that hurt?

441
00:20:58,917 --> 00:21:00,750
Well, the brain
has no pain fibers

442
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:03,333
so all you'll feel is a pinch
and a little vibration.

443
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,083
The electrode
will connect to a wire

444
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:08,542
I will feed under the skin of
your head, neck and shoulder.

445
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:11,458
I'll place a neurostimulator
under your collarbone,

446
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,291
which will send impulses
to block the tremor signals.

447
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:17,709
Poking around in my brain,
you could damage another part.

448
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,500
What if--? What if I go blind?

449
00:21:19,542 --> 00:21:21,208
Oh, there's no chance
of blindness.

450
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,041
It's a very targeted procedure.

451
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,917
I know this is a lot
to take in,

452
00:21:24,959 --> 00:21:28,875
but Dr. Shepherd
is a very gifted neurosurgeon.

453
00:21:28,917 --> 00:21:33,041
This could be good, Laura.
It could get us back on track.

454
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:36,500
Yeah, but it's all
really terrifying.

455
00:21:36,542 --> 00:21:38,667
More terrifying than life
without me?

456
00:21:38,709 --> 00:21:41,041
Look, I don't mean to--

457
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:43,291
I'm scared too,
but you need this.

458
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:47,000
We need this. I need to be able
to trust you again.

459
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,041
Please.

460
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:53,041
Have the surgery.

461
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:01,875
I could've been
screwing anyone.

462
00:22:01,917 --> 00:22:04,041
I mean, I'm with my wife,
and for all I felt,

463
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,875
I could've been
screwing a prostitute.

464
00:22:06,917 --> 00:22:09,041
It was like I was
watching the whole thing.

465
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:12,417
And I felt nothing,
no connection.

466
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:14,333
Sometimes sex is just sex.

467
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,542
Yeah, well, for Violet and me,

468
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,291
sex is pretty much
always about connecting.

469
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:21,041
I mean,
last night was intense,

470
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:23,792
but, I don't know,
it was different.

471
00:22:23,834 --> 00:22:27,792
Any other time you felt
that kind of disconnect?

472
00:22:27,834 --> 00:22:29,041
Maybe in foster care

473
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:30,750
when I was getting
the crap kicked out of me.

474
00:22:30,792 --> 00:22:33,041
Did that happen a lot?

475
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:35,834
Yeah. When I was 13,
I was put in this foster home.

476
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:37,709
They'd already taken in
three other boys,

477
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:40,041
and after the foster parents
went to sleep,

478
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:43,250
the boys would take me to
the garage and just beat on me

479
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:45,667
until they got bored
or I was unconscious.

480
00:22:45,709 --> 00:22:48,041
Well, how did that situation
resolve itself?

481
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:50,208
I fought back.
Broke the biggest kid's nose.

482
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,417
Then they left me alone.
And that disconnection,

483
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:54,792
do you think it was
some kind of a coping mechanism?

484
00:22:54,834 --> 00:22:56,667
To deal with my anger?
Sheldon, I wasn't angry

485
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:59,375
that Violet wanted
to have sex with me.

486
00:22:59,417 --> 00:23:01,792
Are you sure?

487
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,041
All right, come on, lukey.

488
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:07,875
You don't wanna try
the creamed spinach?

489
00:23:07,917 --> 00:23:10,792
It's organic
and filled with antioxidants.

490
00:23:10,834 --> 00:23:13,166
Come on. Don't you wanna
learn to read before Truman?

491
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:14,792
You don't like it.

492
00:23:14,834 --> 00:23:17,208
Could I have some of mine?
Yeah, yeah.

493
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:20,041
All right.
Okay. Okay. Okay.

494
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:22,041
I'm just trying to do
what's best for you.

495
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:24,041
And for daddy.
Yes.

496
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:26,917
He seems good, doesn't he?
Mm-hm.

497
00:23:26,959 --> 00:23:30,667
Yeah, which is weird because
he was so angry and distant,

498
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,792
but then strangely hot.

499
00:23:32,834 --> 00:23:35,041
Although, detached and...

500
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,583
Yeah, this is a completely
inappropriate conversation

501
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,208
to be having with my son,
which I'm having

502
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,250
because the other mommies
wouldn't talk to me.

503
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:43,041
You don't wanna eat,
so you know what?

504
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:46,458
There is no reason we can't both
learn to speak a new language.

505
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,542
All right?

506
00:23:49,959 --> 00:23:51,709
That means "boy."
That's you.

507
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,917
Say "El Niño."

508
00:23:54,792 --> 00:23:56,333
Right.

509
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:02,041
Mama. That's me.

510
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:06,041
Yeah. Yeah, that's me.

511
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:09,041
And "loco."

512
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:10,667
That means crazy.

513
00:24:10,709 --> 00:24:13,250
That's how la madre feels.

514
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:26,500
Jake left you a bottle.
Yeah.

515
00:24:26,542 --> 00:24:28,709
Yeah, he's cool. I like him.
Yeah.

516
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,083
You want me
to take it for you?

517
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:33,792
Whoa. That is a $100 bottle
of Pinot, Sheldon. Hands off.

518
00:24:33,834 --> 00:24:36,583
I-I'll keep it for guests.

519
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:38,750
Even sober people
have dinner parties.

520
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:42,458
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
am I interrupting?

521
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,709
Not at all, not at all.
I was just leaving.

522
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:49,125
Laura, are you okay?
No. I don't--

523
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:52,458
yes and no.
I don't... um...

524
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,000
I'm not gonna
have the surgery.

525
00:24:56,417 --> 00:24:58,333
Uh...

526
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,041
I get it.

527
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:04,542
It's really scary.

528
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:06,291
The idea of someone
cutting into your brain.

529
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:09,166
Oh, no. It's not that.
I mean, ugh-- but...

530
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:12,500
It's-- I don't wanna
give up my meds.

531
00:25:12,542 --> 00:25:14,750
Uh...

532
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:18,500
I don't understand.
I like my meds.

533
00:25:18,542 --> 00:25:21,041
I love my meds.

534
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:23,166
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be dense here,

535
00:25:23,208 --> 00:25:25,500
but we're not
talking about opiates.

536
00:25:25,542 --> 00:25:28,041
I mean, your meds
aren't addictive.

537
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:30,041
It's not addictive that,
for the first time in my life,

538
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:32,041
I don't care what
other people think about me?

539
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:34,667
For the first time in my life,
I'm completely uninhibited.

540
00:25:34,709 --> 00:25:36,166
Yesterday,
in the grocery store,

541
00:25:36,208 --> 00:25:38,333
I walked up to a man,
and five minutes later, five,

542
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:41,250
we were doing it in the back
where they store the produce.

543
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:45,166
That is addictive.

544
00:25:47,208 --> 00:25:50,542
I mean, would you look at me?
I'm a kindergarten teacher.

545
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:54,041
I haven't bothered to wax
anything in ten years

546
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:55,333
because who cares?

547
00:25:55,375 --> 00:25:57,166
And suddenly...

548
00:25:57,208 --> 00:25:59,834
Suddenly, I feel sexy.

549
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:01,667
I feel alive.

550
00:26:02,917 --> 00:26:05,875
Oh, god. I feel just
connected to my body

551
00:26:05,917 --> 00:26:09,000
in ways that I forgot existed.

552
00:26:10,417 --> 00:26:12,166
Everything's changed.

553
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:14,709
I can't give it up.

554
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:17,041
I don't wanna go back.

555
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:19,458
Your husband--
no, I will use condoms.

556
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,041
I mean, no matter what,
from now on,

557
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:23,041
I will keep will safe.
I will. I will.

558
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:26,375
But you have to tell him that
the surgery's not an option.

559
00:26:26,417 --> 00:26:29,583
Tell him that it won't
work for me. Please.

560
00:26:29,625 --> 00:26:31,667
Please.

561
00:26:31,709 --> 00:26:36,083
Laura, you know you sound
a little crazy, right?

562
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:39,041
There is a certain high
from the lack of inhibitions.

563
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:42,000
I get that. I really do.

564
00:26:43,375 --> 00:26:46,333
How much are you willing
to give up to hold on to that?

565
00:26:46,375 --> 00:26:49,041
Dr. Shepherd,
I have Parkinson's.

566
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:51,625
I'm dying.

567
00:26:51,667 --> 00:26:53,041
I'm not quite 40,

568
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:58,250
so I don't actually have
all that much else left to lose.

569
00:27:03,917 --> 00:27:05,500
Lunch and...

570
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:06,750
Hi.

571
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:09,041
Hey-- wow.

572
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:12,709
Violet.
That's a radical change.

573
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,000
You look fantastic.

574
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:15,291
Oh, yeah. Whatever.
Hi, baby.

575
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:19,125
I was bored. I am bored.

576
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:20,917
Do you wanna
have lunch with us?

577
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:23,542
Uh...

578
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:28,083
All right.

579
00:27:29,959 --> 00:27:35,083
Okay. Lucas, auntie Addison
is very, very hungry,

580
00:27:35,125 --> 00:27:37,250
so I'm gonna go eat lunch
with your mommy

581
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:38,667
while you go and play

582
00:27:38,709 --> 00:27:41,083
with the pink whales
in the sand.

583
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:42,500
Wanna go play?

584
00:27:42,542 --> 00:27:44,041
- Hey, buddy.
- All right.

585
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:45,834
Good guy.

586
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:49,000
Yeah, go water them.

587
00:27:54,083 --> 00:27:55,583
Are you...?

588
00:27:57,083 --> 00:27:58,125
Are you hiding?

589
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:03,041
I thought it was a woman
from my mommy group.

590
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:04,709
You're in a mommy group?

591
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,041
I went once.
Hated them all.

592
00:28:09,583 --> 00:28:12,041
That's a lie.
They didn't like me.

593
00:28:12,083 --> 00:28:13,917
They're not even
returning my e-mails.

594
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:16,542
Oh.
So I chopped off my hair.

595
00:28:16,583 --> 00:28:19,375
I see.

596
00:28:20,417 --> 00:28:23,375
You're very polite.

597
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:26,041
Well, I don't know
what to say.

598
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:28,041
I mean, you and I,
we work together,

599
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:29,750
but it's not like
we've ever been friends.

600
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:31,041
You used to sleep
with my husband,

601
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:32,041
take care of my son.

602
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:34,041
I thought of anybody,
you would be able--

603
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:36,041
all right, I think
you're being ridiculous.

604
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:37,375
Oh, wow.
No. I mean,

605
00:28:37,417 --> 00:28:40,041
of course you don't like
any of the mommies

606
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:41,125
in the mommy group.

607
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:43,000
You have nothing in common
with these women

608
00:28:43,041 --> 00:28:45,000
other than the fact
that you all have children.

609
00:28:45,041 --> 00:28:47,458
I mean, it would be
like me being friends

610
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,166
with every infertile woman
in town

611
00:28:49,208 --> 00:28:52,250
just because
we can't have kids.

612
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:54,208
Yes.

613
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,875
Yes, yes.

614
00:28:55,917 --> 00:28:58,667
God. I feel better.
Good.

615
00:28:58,709 --> 00:29:01,333
You know, I mean, here I am,
trying to have a baby,

616
00:29:01,375 --> 00:29:02,875
you know, without Sam.

617
00:29:02,917 --> 00:29:06,041
And that's weird, of course.
We were talking about me still.

618
00:29:06,083 --> 00:29:09,834
We weren't done.
Right. Sorry.

619
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:11,291
I'm just...

620
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:15,041
I'm just really lonely.
I am not a mommy-group mommy,

621
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:16,875
and I'm not allowed to work,

622
00:29:16,917 --> 00:29:19,041
and my husband
had a heart attack.

623
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:21,583
That's a scary sentence.

624
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:23,291
Thank you.

625
00:29:24,583 --> 00:29:25,959
Do you wanna be friends?

626
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:29,041
I mean,
is that what this lunch is?

627
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:30,333
Do you?

628
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:34,166
I like your haircut.

629
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:37,333
I...

630
00:29:38,917 --> 00:29:41,750
I think it's great you wanna
have a kid on your own.

631
00:29:41,792 --> 00:29:44,041
Yeah?
I'm lonely too, you know?

632
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:46,041
Without Nai,
I'm really lonely.

633
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:48,875
So we'll be friends.

634
00:29:48,917 --> 00:29:51,291
We'll be friends.

635
00:29:57,041 --> 00:29:58,500
- Hey.
- Hey, Sam.

636
00:29:58,542 --> 00:30:01,917
How is your relationship going?
Mine is great.

637
00:30:01,959 --> 00:30:04,959
You should really think
about getting married. Mm.

638
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:08,041
Hey, did you schedule
Laura's surgery yet?

639
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:09,667
She canceled it.

640
00:30:09,709 --> 00:30:13,041
She is not interested
in changing her behavior.

641
00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:14,250
She wants to sleep around.

642
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:16,166
She even asked me
to tell her husband

643
00:30:16,208 --> 00:30:18,041
that surgery is not an option.

644
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:19,125
Well, you can't lie
to the man.

645
00:30:19,166 --> 00:30:21,166
I am well aware of that,
Charlotte,

646
00:30:21,208 --> 00:30:23,041
which is why I'm saying
nothing at all.

647
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:25,792
So Laura gets a free pass to
cheat on her husband?

648
00:30:25,834 --> 00:30:27,792
How she lives her life,
that's her own business.

649
00:30:27,834 --> 00:30:31,000
She's in a relationship.
No, that's not right.

650
00:30:31,041 --> 00:30:33,041
Once you betray
your partner's trust,

651
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:35,542
it's hard to get it back.

652
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:38,709
Wow. You're a bitch
to me and to Cooper.

653
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,125
Who knew you had such range?

654
00:30:48,959 --> 00:30:50,792
Now, that is a beautiful uterus.

655
00:30:50,834 --> 00:30:53,166
- Nicely done.
- Thank you.

656
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:55,083
What do you think about
joanie Matthews?

657
00:30:55,125 --> 00:30:59,041
Uh, she's a bit of
an ivf mad scientist.

658
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:01,166
Brilliant. Why?

659
00:31:01,208 --> 00:31:03,333
- Just looking around.
- Dave atkins?

660
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:06,875
Oh, he's real old-school.
Warm, great bedside manner.

661
00:31:06,917 --> 00:31:08,250
I think you should
meet with them both.

662
00:31:08,291 --> 00:31:10,959
Send me a list of who you're
looking at. I'll vet them.

663
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,625
Thank you.
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,

664
00:31:13,667 --> 00:31:16,041
I am going to release
the Kelly.

665
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:17,667
There we go.

666
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:21,000
Damn it. Okay. The internal
iliac has retracted.

667
00:31:21,041 --> 00:31:22,250
I need to stop the bleeding.

668
00:31:22,291 --> 00:31:24,750
Gonna have to clamp
the vascular supply proximally.

669
00:31:24,792 --> 00:31:28,000
There's too much blood.
I need you to clear the field.

670
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:33,458
Damn it. Retracted too far.
I need to embolize the vessel.

671
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,500
Cross her for six units
and hang the ffp.

672
00:31:36,542 --> 00:31:39,375
If you embolize, it's gonna cut
supply to the transplant.

673
00:31:39,417 --> 00:31:40,875
If I don't, I'll lose Nina.

674
00:31:40,917 --> 00:31:42,458
Come on, Nina.
Hang in there.

675
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:45,000
Hang in there now.

676
00:31:52,083 --> 00:31:54,041
You fought one hell
of a fight in there, cowboy.

677
00:31:55,333 --> 00:31:56,500
Lost, though.

678
00:31:56,542 --> 00:31:57,917
Look, you tried,

679
00:31:57,959 --> 00:31:59,709
which is more than
most doctors would've done.

680
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:02,041
It's more than
I would've done.

681
00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:04,041
You saved her life.
That's a win.

682
00:32:04,083 --> 00:32:06,291
Not for me, it isn't.

683
00:32:12,458 --> 00:32:14,875
- There.
- Yeah, silly pooh.

684
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:19,458
Hey. Um, hey, before you go,
I was thinking

685
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,208
I wanna give the nanny
a few more hours.

686
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:25,041
I wanna start another book.
I think it'd be good for me.

687
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:26,291
Lucas is gonna need therapy

688
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:28,458
when he's old enough
to read the first one.

689
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,458
Come on, Pete.
You're in the office every day.

690
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,667
You get to use your training,
your intellect.

691
00:32:33,709 --> 00:32:35,250
Every part of you
is engaged.

692
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:37,041
And, uh, I want that too.
I need it.

693
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:39,041
I can't believe it.
Already bored with motherhood.

694
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:41,709
You don't think that raising
our child is important work.

695
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:44,542
Of course it is. But I don't
see why I have to do it

696
00:32:44,583 --> 00:32:46,041
to the exclusion
of everything else.

697
00:32:46,083 --> 00:32:49,667
It's important Lucas sees
a woman who's well-rounded--

698
00:32:49,709 --> 00:32:51,583
a 2-year-old
doesn't want well-rounded.

699
00:32:51,625 --> 00:32:54,291
A 2-year-old
wants his mother.

700
00:32:54,333 --> 00:32:57,500
So long, pal. Bye.

701
00:32:57,542 --> 00:33:00,041
It's not like I've been
at home for the past two years.

702
00:33:00,083 --> 00:33:04,041
Why is it such a shock I would
wanna work and raise my child?

703
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:06,000
What the hell
is going on with you?

704
00:33:07,083 --> 00:33:08,500
I'm late for work.

705
00:33:11,959 --> 00:33:15,709
I'm sorry, Nina.
I'm so sorry.

706
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,834
But we knew
this was a long shot, right?

707
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:19,083
We knew that,
but we tried anyway,

708
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:21,417
because that was
important to you.

709
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:25,917
You're young, you have
the support of your family,

710
00:33:25,959 --> 00:33:27,500
and you will be a mother.

711
00:33:27,542 --> 00:33:31,083
We can explore surrogacy now
or you can adopt.

712
00:33:31,125 --> 00:33:33,041
But I wanted to be
like my mom.

713
00:33:33,083 --> 00:33:36,041
I know. And if your mom
were here right now,

714
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:38,041
she would tell you that
it wasn't giving birth to you

715
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:39,917
that defined her.

716
00:33:39,959 --> 00:33:42,583
It was the first time you
looked in her eyes and smiled.

717
00:33:42,625 --> 00:33:46,792
It was the first time
you fell asleep on her shoulder

718
00:33:46,834 --> 00:33:49,792
and she'd barely
let herself breathe

719
00:33:49,834 --> 00:33:52,000
because she never wanted
that moment to end.

720
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:57,625
You will have your baby,

721
00:33:57,667 --> 00:33:59,041
however she comes
into the world,

722
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:02,041
and you will love her
incredibly well,

723
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:04,083
because your mom
taught you how.

724
00:34:05,667 --> 00:34:07,458
And that's all that matters.

725
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:11,000
Okay?
That's all that matters.

726
00:34:13,291 --> 00:34:15,208
Hi.
Hey.

727
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:18,000
Thanks for, uh--
thanks for meeting me here.

728
00:34:18,041 --> 00:34:20,250
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, is there a reason

729
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:22,125
we couldn't meet
at the office?

730
00:34:22,166 --> 00:34:26,792
Well, I was just hoping to,
uh, speak to you as a friend

731
00:34:26,834 --> 00:34:28,625
rather than a doctor.

732
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:30,083
Um...
Okay.

733
00:34:30,125 --> 00:34:34,208
I don't understand why or how
you could do this to will.

734
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:39,792
Well, that's because
you and I aren't friends.

735
00:34:39,834 --> 00:34:42,041
Fair enough. Uh...

736
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:43,667
Well, what about
20 years of marriage?

737
00:34:43,709 --> 00:34:45,375
That's gotta mean something.

738
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:47,291
With these meds,
I don't have a really great

739
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:49,000
editing mechanism anymore.
Okay.

740
00:34:49,041 --> 00:34:52,166
So I'm just gonna say
some things. Uh...

741
00:34:52,208 --> 00:34:54,250
My husband won't have sex

742
00:34:54,291 --> 00:34:56,709
outside of
the missionary position.

743
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:58,083
And if he finishes
before I do,

744
00:34:58,125 --> 00:35:00,375
he rolls over
and he goes to sleep.

745
00:35:00,417 --> 00:35:02,291
Early on in our marriage,

746
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:04,625
when he caught me
trying to finish

747
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:09,041
after he was done,
he called me disgusting.

748
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:11,917
Disgusting.
So he has some issues.

749
00:35:11,959 --> 00:35:15,041
In this particular area,
he has issues.

750
00:35:15,083 --> 00:35:18,125
And his issues
have become my issues.

751
00:35:18,166 --> 00:35:19,709
Mm-hm.
That's what happens

752
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,041
in a marriage.
That's right.

753
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:23,875
And he has no interest
in dealing with those issues.

754
00:35:23,917 --> 00:35:27,709
And for the first time,
I understand that,

755
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:33,583
because I have no interest in
dealing with mine.

756
00:35:33,625 --> 00:35:36,542
I mean,
we make a great team.

757
00:35:36,583 --> 00:35:40,500
On so many levels, we're--
we're a great team.

758
00:35:40,542 --> 00:35:44,500
So don't judge me.
Please.

759
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:46,667
You're not
inside my marriage.

760
00:35:46,709 --> 00:35:50,166
And you can't be inside
anybody else's marriage, either.

761
00:35:50,208 --> 00:35:52,000
You have to know that.

762
00:35:52,041 --> 00:35:55,041
Appearances,
they mean nothing.

763
00:35:55,083 --> 00:35:56,959
Clearly.

764
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,500
Look at me.

765
00:36:01,417 --> 00:36:03,583
She leaves us
every chance she gets

766
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:05,041
for these rooms
full of strangers,

767
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:07,917
who are desperate to tell her
what a difference she made.

768
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:10,041
Violet decided to go
on the book tour.

769
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:11,709
She wants to write.
Not the same thing.

770
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:14,041
Well, it feels the same.
Don't be such a baby.

771
00:36:14,083 --> 00:36:15,709
Excuse me?

772
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,041
You want the benefit
of my expertise,

773
00:36:17,083 --> 00:36:18,125
as a friend, without paying?

774
00:36:18,166 --> 00:36:20,333
Well, with that
comes the truth.

775
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:22,041
What are you afraid of, Pete?

776
00:36:22,083 --> 00:36:24,500
Sheldon, I worked
in Bosnia in a war zone.

777
00:36:24,542 --> 00:36:26,500
I'm in the chaos of the er
every day.

778
00:36:26,542 --> 00:36:28,917
I'm not a guy that gets scared.
I told you. I'm angry.

779
00:36:28,959 --> 00:36:31,166
I know what you told me,
but a 14-year-old boy

780
00:36:31,208 --> 00:36:33,959
who's dumped with foster
families isn't just angry.

781
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,250
And the disconnect you feel,
that's not about anger.

782
00:36:38,208 --> 00:36:40,041
So, what are you afraid of?

783
00:36:46,792 --> 00:36:50,041
Hey. Uh, I think
you were right.

784
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:53,375
One of my favorite sentences
in the world.

785
00:36:53,417 --> 00:36:54,959
Right about what?
About Laura.

786
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,625
I talked to her, and, uh,
I guess it is her business.

787
00:36:58,667 --> 00:37:01,333
You know, what she's doing
and what she tells will.

788
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:03,959
It's not easy, but sometimes
the truth is worse.

789
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,750
Yeah.

790
00:37:05,792 --> 00:37:09,375
So I guess she'll have her high,
he won't know,

791
00:37:09,417 --> 00:37:11,834
and hopefully...

792
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:13,458
It'll be better that way.

793
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,041
I'm drowning here, Charlotte.

794
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:36,166
And I obviously don't know
what to do to save myself,

795
00:37:36,208 --> 00:37:37,709
and every time
I try to say anything,

796
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,875
it's like tying another
cinder block to my ankle.

797
00:37:39,917 --> 00:37:45,041
So if you just tell me
what to do, I will do it,

798
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:47,500
whatever it is, happily.

799
00:37:47,542 --> 00:37:49,917
Seriously, come on.
Tell-- tell me.

800
00:37:49,959 --> 00:37:52,750
Come on. Tell me.

801
00:37:52,792 --> 00:37:53,917
Tell me.
Stop it.

802
00:37:53,959 --> 00:37:57,500
You made me
be the sheriff with you.

803
00:37:57,542 --> 00:38:00,041
It sucks being the sheriff.
I'm good at it.

804
00:38:00,083 --> 00:38:02,375
Everybody already thinks i'm
the wicked witch of St. ambrose.

805
00:38:02,417 --> 00:38:03,875
Everyone who?
Everyone-- Amelia?

806
00:38:03,917 --> 00:38:06,667
Look, I don't care.
It's fine. It's my job.

807
00:38:06,709 --> 00:38:08,041
The job isn't
about making friends.

808
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:10,041
But you're my husband.

809
00:38:10,083 --> 00:38:13,000
Don't make me be the sheriff
with you too.

810
00:38:15,083 --> 00:38:16,458
Look...

811
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:22,041
I don't regret saving kerri.

812
00:38:22,083 --> 00:38:23,083
I don't.

813
00:38:23,125 --> 00:38:26,333
But I do regret
not having your back.

814
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:30,709
I will never put you
in that position again,

815
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:33,291
and I will not make you
be the sheriff.

816
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,041
We should be able to tell
each other anything, right?

817
00:38:51,083 --> 00:38:53,333
That sounds like the prelude
to something bad.

818
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:55,333
No, no.
No, it's not bad.

819
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:57,041
Sam.
I--

820
00:38:57,083 --> 00:38:58,917
if you have something
to tell me...

821
00:38:58,959 --> 00:39:02,041
No, no, no. It's not me.
It's you. It's yesterday.

822
00:39:02,083 --> 00:39:04,583
You wanted to talk to me
about the ivf stuff,

823
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:08,083
and I, uh, I cut you off.

824
00:39:08,125 --> 00:39:09,375
And I'm sorry.

825
00:39:09,417 --> 00:39:11,709
It's okay.
No, it's not okay.

826
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:15,375
We're together and, you know,
we shouldn't have secrets

827
00:39:15,417 --> 00:39:17,166
or, you know,
things that we're thinking about

828
00:39:17,208 --> 00:39:19,333
that we can't say.

829
00:39:19,375 --> 00:39:21,750
Agreed.

830
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:25,000
Okay, good. So tell me--

831
00:39:25,041 --> 00:39:26,959
tell me about the ivf,
the doctors.

832
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,417
Is there anybody
that you like? Um...

833
00:39:29,458 --> 00:39:31,166
Sam.

834
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:32,917
Mm.

835
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:35,750
Thank you.

836
00:39:35,792 --> 00:39:40,041
But really, I'm fine.

837
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:42,041
Okay.

838
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:08,291
I'm afraid you think
I'm a bad mother

839
00:40:08,333 --> 00:40:10,000
and that you don't
love me enough.

840
00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:16,041
I'm afraid I'll die before
I'm done raising Lucas.

841
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,417
I renamed the practice.
Did I tell you?

842
00:40:24,458 --> 00:40:28,583
Seaside health and wellness.

843
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:30,458
I thought about calling it
Montgomery wellness.

844
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,417
Bizzy would've told me
to do that.

845
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:35,291
It is all of my money
funding the place now.

846
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:38,917
But I didn't do it.

847
00:40:38,959 --> 00:40:43,625
It is a cooperative practice,
and the name reflects that.

848
00:40:43,667 --> 00:40:45,041
A few years ago, I...

849
00:40:45,083 --> 00:40:47,625
You would've gone with
"Montgomery."

850
00:40:47,667 --> 00:40:51,417
Yeah. I would have.

851
00:40:51,458 --> 00:40:53,041
So...

852
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:55,458
You know, no matter what,
whatever happens,

853
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,041
Sam has rubbed off on me.

854
00:40:58,083 --> 00:41:01,375
His goodness, his kindness,

855
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:03,917
his honesty,

856
00:41:03,959 --> 00:41:08,500
his generosity of spirit...

857
00:41:08,542 --> 00:41:10,375
Has rubbed off.

858
00:41:15,083 --> 00:41:17,166
Hello.

859
00:41:18,333 --> 00:41:20,125
See you at lunch.

860
00:41:23,125 --> 00:41:26,041
Cooper?
Yes.

861
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:28,375
You don't remember me,
do you?

862
00:41:28,417 --> 00:41:32,041
No. I'm sorry,
have we met?

863
00:41:32,083 --> 00:41:34,792
Nine years ago. I was
tending bar at the key club.

864
00:41:34,834 --> 00:41:37,291
You came in,
stayed till last call.

865
00:41:37,333 --> 00:41:40,041
We had sex in my SUV
in the parking lot.

866
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:45,083
Erica.
Hi, Erica.

867
00:41:45,125 --> 00:41:47,417
Yeah, hi. Awkward.

868
00:41:47,458 --> 00:41:51,041
Yeah.
Uh, I'm married now.

869
00:41:51,083 --> 00:41:52,458
I have a son.

870
00:41:55,083 --> 00:41:57,291
He's 8.

871
00:41:57,333 --> 00:41:59,250
Mm-hm.

872
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:02,709
His name is Mason.

873
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:04,625
And he's...

874
00:42:04,667 --> 00:42:07,041
And this is...

875
00:42:07,083 --> 00:42:09,375
This is really not what I...

876
00:42:09,417 --> 00:42:11,041
Anyway, ahem...

877
00:42:11,083 --> 00:42:13,000
He's-- well...

878
00:42:15,083 --> 00:42:16,625
He's yours.
