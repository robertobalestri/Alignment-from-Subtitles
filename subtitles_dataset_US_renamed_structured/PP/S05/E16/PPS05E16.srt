82
00:03:06,834 --> 00:03:08,083

83
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,041

this is eggs Bennett.

What time's your appointment
with Dr. Wallace?

87
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,583
I want to go
to the planetarium.

88
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,125
Have you been there...

89
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:23,375
Unh-unh.

90
00:03:23,417 --> 00:03:25,041
To the observatory?

91
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:27,834
Remember how we used to crawl
out of your bedroom window

92
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:31,041
and lie on the roof
and stare at the stars?

93
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,375
Yep, and you used to
make up names

94
00:03:32,417 --> 00:03:34,041
for all the constellations--

95
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,625
the big flopper...

96
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:36,834
And Orion's cookie.

97
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I thought about that a lot

98
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,834
while I was out there.

99
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,834
On warm nights,
I would lie on the beach

100
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,041
and name the constellations

101
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,875
out loud, like I was
doing it for you,

102
00:03:48,917 --> 00:03:51,834
which probably made me seem

103
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,667
even crazier than I am.

104
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:55,834
Than you were.

105
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,834
Than you were.

106
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,625
All right, how about this?

107
00:03:59,667 --> 00:04:01,041
You go see Dr. Wallace,
and, uh,

108
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,625
I'll make a few calls,

109
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:04,041
wrap a few things up
at the office,

110
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,834
then we can go to
the planetarium together?

111
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,834
In the middle
of your work day?

112
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,667
They owe me some time off.

113
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,709
Hit it.

114
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,834
Hey. I ordered
some breakfast tacos.

115
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,834
They'll be here in a minute.
You want one?

116
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,041
Uh, I think I'll pass.

117
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,542
You don't look well.

118
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,542
Well, that's very kind
of you.

119
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:30,041
Oh, no. I wasn't
trying to insult you. I...

120
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,834
I'm just a little run down.

121
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,208
But thanks.

122
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,458
Yeah.

123
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,959
Hey, Dr. Wallace.

124
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,917

125
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,208

126
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,542
Hi.

127
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,542
So... how much time
are you gonna take off?

128
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,041
Uh, thank you.

129
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,709
As long as Corinne needs
to get back up on her feet.

130
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,667
How's she doing?

131
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:49,041
She's doing good.

132
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,750
It's, uh... it's like
a little bit more of her

133
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,458
comes back to me every day.

134
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,917
That's great, Sam,
really.

135
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:57,458
Thank you.

136
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,792
Oh, hey.

137
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:04,041
Uh, we...

138
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,458
We didn't get a chance

139
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,792
to finish talking
the other day.

140
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:09,041
About what?

141
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,041
Um...

142
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,166

143
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,917
Our...

144
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,458
Us.

145
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,750
Oh, i--yeah. I was--
I was finished.

146
00:05:17,792 --> 00:05:20,542
You weren't finished?
I'm--I'm all ears.

147
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,917
I... uh, oh, i--

148
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:25,291
I guess--no, I...

149
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,625
Was finished.

150
00:05:36,417 --> 00:05:38,041
It's still hard to believe
we're having twins.

151
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,583
I know. Oh.

152
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,041
I got some Teddy bear bumpers
for the boy crib.

153
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,417
And I'm trying to go
gender neutral with Sarah's,

154
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,041
but you're not making it easy.
Don't do that.

155
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,041
Don't call her that.

156
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,083
Sorry. She hates it
when I use her name.

157
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,333
Because it's not her name.

158
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,500
Yeah, but both have grandmothers
named Sarah,

159
00:05:49,542 --> 00:05:51,375
so it does seem like
a natural choice--
it's bad luck to name a baby
before its born.

160
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:52,709
Oh, whatever.

161
00:05:57,083 --> 00:06:00,458
Is something wrong?

162
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,959
Oh, just...

163
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,417
Oh, no.

164
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,625
I am sorry.

165
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:09,041
But your boy has a severe
diaphragmatic hernia.

166
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,041
What--what--what is--
is that bad?

167
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,041
It's a congenital birth defect

168
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,041
that keeps the baby's lungs
from forming properly.

169
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,667
Can you fix it
once he's born?

170
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,041
If he is born

171
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,166
with this, at best,

172
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:22,375
his quality of life will be
greatly diminished.

173
00:06:22,417 --> 00:06:24,041
Okay.

174
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,041
I-I've seen on those
medical shows, they--

175
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,959
they do surgery while the baby's
still in the womb.

176
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,500
Yes, they can, and I do.

177
00:06:29,542 --> 00:06:31,500
I've had success treating
diaphragmatic hernias...
Oh.

178
00:06:31,542 --> 00:06:34,500
With in utero surgery,
but you are carrying twins.

179
00:06:34,542 --> 00:06:37,250
Well, why is that--
what does that mean?

180
00:06:38,542 --> 00:06:40,291
If I do surgery on your boy
in utero,

181
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,792
it creates a very serious risk
for the girl.

182
00:06:42,834 --> 00:06:44,417
Oh, god.

183
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,709
So you're saying that we--
we just--

184
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,041
we do nothing
and we lose our boy?

185
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,625
Or we do surgery

186
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:53,250
and possibly lose them both.

187
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:05,041
Oh, hey, they opened
a new reptile house at the zoo.

188
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,125
You think Lucas might want
to go down there

189
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:08,917
and check out
the komodo dragons?

190
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:10,917
I think Lucas would like to
live with the komodo dragons.

191
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:13,041
Well, maybe I'll
cut out early today

192
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,250
and take him over.

193
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,083
I could go with you.
I mean, if...

194
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,875
Yeah, sure.

195
00:07:17,917 --> 00:07:19,041
We'll leave about 4:00.

196
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,417
I hate this day.

197
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:22,667
Look, if doing surgery on him

198
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,875
puts his healthy sister
at serious risk--

199
00:07:24,917 --> 00:07:26,083
oh, how do you make
that call?

200
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,875
Let one of your kids die

201
00:07:27,917 --> 00:07:29,083
or risk the healthy one
to save the sick one?

202
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,625
Mm. Just the kind of happy talk
I look forward to

203
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:33,041
with my midmorning tea.

204
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,667
I don't make that call.
They have to make the call--

205
00:07:35,709 --> 00:07:37,875
this funny, happy couple

206
00:07:37,917 --> 00:07:39,250
who spent a long time

207
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:42,083
and a lot of blood, sweat,
and tears to make these babies.

208
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,041
Ugh. I hate this day.

209
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:45,750
Are you really
gonna give them a choice?

210
00:07:45,792 --> 00:07:47,041
Fetal surgery
with a twin pregnancy,

211
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,041
it's too dangerous.

212
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,500
Maybe.
Look, Addison,

213
00:07:49,542 --> 00:07:52,083
putting a balloon
into a fetus' trachea

214
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,500
in this situation
with a twin pregnancy,

215
00:07:53,542 --> 00:07:54,750
it's a huge risk.

216
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:56,500
The amniotic membranes
could separate.

217
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:59,166
There could be bleeds,
premature labor.

218
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,959
But she could save
both babies, right?

219
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,166
I could.

220
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,709
It's possible.

221
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,250
It's risky,
but I could.

222
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,333
I mean, Addie's a rock star
with a scope.

223
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,375
If she says she can do it,
I would not bet against her.

224
00:08:09,417 --> 00:08:10,917
I'm not betting
against her. I'm just--

225
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,041
hey, hey, will you
talk to them for me?

226
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,375
Will you help them decide?

227
00:08:13,417 --> 00:08:14,917
S-Sure.

228
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:16,041
Addison, you're--
you're making this messy.

229
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,375
I'm not making it messy.
I'm giving them options.

230
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:18,917
Violet here is gonna deal
with the mess.

231
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,917
Now you can hate
this day, too.

232
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,041
Thanks for that.

233
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:26,834
Cooper.

234
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,375
Everything's good.

235
00:08:28,417 --> 00:08:30,125
You have a sofa.
You could take a nap on it.

236
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,625
Everybody'd understand--

237
00:08:31,667 --> 00:08:34,000
no, no, no, I'm totally awake.
I'm charting.

238
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,917
How's Erica this morning?

239
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:39,041
Fine. You know,
I mean... frustrated.

240
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:42,041
Recovery's not going
as fast as she would like.

241
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:43,458
It's taking its toll
on Mason.

242
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,041
It's taking its toll
on you, too.

243
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,375
I am fine.

244
00:08:46,417 --> 00:08:47,750
I can do this.

245
00:08:47,792 --> 00:08:49,041
I don't doubt
that you could do it.

246
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:52,291
It's just...
I'm worried about you.

247
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,250
Have you been keeping track
of your moods

248
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,166
in a journal
like we talked about?

249
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,959
Yeah, of course.

250
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,166
Sam told me I should write down
more than just my moods.

251
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:06,250
He said it might
help me process

252
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:09,041
what I'm feeling
or thinking,

253
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:12,959
to help me understand
before I react.

254
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,333
Is it helping?

255
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,041
Yeah, I think so.

256
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,917
I mean, I-I know
it's gonna take time,

257
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:21,166
but I'm feeling focused.

258
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,875
My mind is...

259
00:09:23,917 --> 00:09:25,625
It's like a fog
has lifted.

260
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:27,083
That's wonderful.

261
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:29,875
You should feel proud
of your progress.

262
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:33,583
I think it's important that we
talk about your expectations.

263
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:36,792
Sam thinks I should get
a part-time job,

264
00:09:36,834 --> 00:09:40,041
maybe volunteer
at the homeless shelter.

265
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:42,041
You know,
to keep myself busy

266
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:45,041
so I don't get too preoccupied
with my thoughts.

267
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,041
Is that
what you want to do?

268
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:50,041
Well, Sam's taking time off
to be with me,

269
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:53,041
to make sure I have
everything I need.

270
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:55,041
But, um...

271
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:59,083
He can't always
be with me and...

272
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,709
And what,

273
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,041
Corinne?

274
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,291
What happens

275
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:07,959
if I can't keep the job?

276
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,125
Um, what--what happens
if I start to slide back?

277
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:14,041
I don't want
to let him down.

278
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,959
Hey.

279
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,917
So how's she doing?

280
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:31,959
She seems to be responding well
to the medications,

281
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,291
you know,
the daily routines.

282
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,542
Good. I wanted to take her
to the planetarium today.

283
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,166
She's so excited.
Sam--

284
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,709
she's scared,

285
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,458
but I don't know,
for the first time,

286
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,250
I feel like I can see the light
at the end of the tunnel.

287
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,875
That light could be
an oncoming train.

288
00:10:44,917 --> 00:10:48,041
Wait, I thought--i thought
you said she was doing better.

289
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,291
People with bipolar disorder,
they go in cycles.

290
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:53,709
Right? There are good days,
and there are setbacks.

291
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,750
Setbacks, yeah, I know.
Believe me. I get that.

292
00:10:55,792 --> 00:10:58,208
But I'm here for her now.

293
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,000
So, you know, what--
whatever's ahead,

294
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,333
I think I can handle it.

295
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,709
Thank you.

296
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,625
Yeah.

297
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,375
You look nice today.

298
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,041
Really? You think?

299
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,917
Oh, I wouldn't have said it
if I didn't mean it.

300
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:13,125
No, i--no, I know,
but I mean, sometimes,

301
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,917
men just--
Violet, take the compliment.

302
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,125
Okay. You're right.

303
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:19,834
Can I ask you something?

304
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,959
Sure.

305
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
What is your position
on casual sex?

306
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:29,083
Are you--are you
propositioning me?

307
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,125
N-No.

308
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,375
No, I just--i wanted
the, uh, you know,

309
00:11:33,417 --> 00:11:35,041
the male perspective.

310
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,375
Well, let's see.
When I was in my 20s,

311
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:38,041
I was all for it.

312
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,375
You know,
for most of my 30s,

313
00:11:39,417 --> 00:11:41,041
I was
in a committed relationship,

314
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,375
and when I wasn't,

315
00:11:42,417 --> 00:11:44,375
casual sex was something
I could take or leave.

316
00:11:44,417 --> 00:11:46,041
Now that I'm in my 40s,

317
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,667
it is nice to have
something more substantial.

318
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,750
Huh.

319
00:11:51,792 --> 00:11:54,041
I would've pegged you for...

320
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,458
Being more adventurous.

321
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,625
Based on?

322
00:11:57,667 --> 00:11:59,041
Well, you know, you're smart,
you're handsome.

323
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:01,041
I'm sure you're never
lacking with the ladies.

324
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,041
I'm an old-fashioned guy.
What can I tell you?

325
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,041
You got the wrong idea
about me, Violet.

326
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,625
Really?

327
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,709
Fiji.

328
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,041
Can anybody in this office
keep a secret?

329
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,500
It's really
not what we do best.

330
00:12:25,417 --> 00:12:27,041
I brought you a burrito.

331
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,041
Sheldon, I-I told you,
I didn't want anything.

332
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,583
And, you know...

333
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:34,041
When you knock, it is
polite to wait for a reply.

334
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,250
Oh, well, sorry.

335
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,041
I'm gonna get some coffee.

336
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,291
Okay.

337
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:53,750
And next, I'm going to...

338
00:12:53,792 --> 00:12:58,083
Add a little half and half
and some sugar.

339
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,417
Why the running commentary?

340
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:03,500
Well, I want to make sure you
get all the details straight

341
00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:05,500
for when you tell Violet.

342
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,667
Look, you know...

343
00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:11,583
Palm Springs
was--was intense,

344
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,458
and i--and I needed someone
to process it with, and--

345
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,041
you told her about
palm Springs? Wow. Uh...

346
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,000
She only mentioned Fiji.

347
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:19,542
Crap.

348
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:22,083
Okay, you know what? You are
the one who started this.

349
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,458
You know, you were all,
"oh, do you think there's

350
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,959
something emotional
between us."

351
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,083
I wasn't even thinking
about it.

352
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,542
Really?

353
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,959
Okay, I was
thinking about it,

354
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,166
about you,
but at least I came clean.

355
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:37,208
Not like you. You haven't even
said why you wanted to know.

356
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:42,750
Why--why did you want
to know?

357
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,000
Tell Violet,
if she wants to hear about

358
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,709
what you say in your sleep
when you're drunk,

359
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,166
I'll be in my office
all afternoon.

360
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,917
We appreciate Dr. Montgomery
having you talk to us,

361
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:00,208
but Dani and I
have come to a decision.

362
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:04,041
We don't want
to do the surgery.

363
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:07,041
That must have been
a very hard thing to come to.

364
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:09,041
Well, we're having a baby,

365
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,083
a beautiful,
healthy baby girl.

366
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,041
It's...

367
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,917
It's a blessing.

368
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:17,542
It's okay to be upset,
Dani.

369
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:20,417
What you and Laurel are doing
is very hard.

370
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:24,041
Losing a child at any age
is devastating, but...

371
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,166
It's just, I don't think
that we have to lose

372
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:27,542
either one of them.

373
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,125
But we agreed, the surgery,
it's just too risky.

374
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,458
Did you agree, Dani?

375
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,041
N-No. No.

376
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,834
You were just so adamant when
we spoke to Dr. Montgomery...

377
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:40,041
I didn't know what to think.

378
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,875
What do you want?

379
00:14:41,917 --> 00:14:44,166
I think if we have a chance
to have both of our babies,

380
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,000
that that's
what we should do.

381
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,000
No, all the doctors
we've seen,

382
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,208
all the money we've spent,

383
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,041
the night I almost died
in the E.R.--

384
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,917
it was all to have a baby.

385
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,208
Now we can have one.

386
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,083
But Dr. Montgomery said
we can have both of them.

387
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,083
No. No. She said maybe.

388
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:02,041
She said it comes with
very serious risk.

389
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:05,083
God, Dani, it's my body.
It's my decision.

390
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,166
Did you really
just say that?

391
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,667
Dani, i--

392
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:10,625
Dani--
did you really just pull
the "it's my body" card?

393
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:12,083
I didn't--i...

394
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,917
Those are my eggs in there.
Those are my babies.

395
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:15,500
Dani, Laurel--

396
00:15:15,542 --> 00:15:17,041
I-I don't want to have to
say good-bye to one of them.

397
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,792
You think I want to lose
one of our kids?

398
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,625
Oh, now they're
our kids again.

399
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:22,166
You think I want this?

400
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,041
You think
this isn't killing me?

401
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,917
Look, I told you
not to name them.

402
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:27,208
Oh, my god.

403
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,667
Are you kidding me?

404
00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:31,041
I can't lose them both, Dani.
I can't.

405
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,834
You are so scared
of everything.

406
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:36,208
She's scared to name a baby.
You're scared to have surgery.

407
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,458
You're scared
to come to a hospital.

408
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,959
I get it, Laurel.

409
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:41,125
And it is your body,
but if you

410
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:42,917
let one of our babies die

411
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,750
without doing everything
you can to save him,

412
00:15:46,792 --> 00:15:48,208

413
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,625

he was above it all,

was disingenuous,

even knowing your name,

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,667

00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,000
No, I heard a noise.

533
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,417
I was just... I wanted
to make sure she's okay.

534
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:18,041
Yeah, uh, Corinne, let's go
back inside, all right?

535
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,041
No, no, no, no. I'm not--
I'm not done yet.

536
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,333
No, come on.
L-Let's go in.

537
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:21,583
You can
tell me about this inside.

538
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,041
It's--it's late.

539
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,083
But--but--but did I
tell you about cepheus?

540
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,500
'Cause, you know, that's one
of the important ones,

541
00:20:26,542 --> 00:20:28,041
and they don't really
ever talk about it.

542
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,291
I know.

543
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:32,792
♪♪♪

544
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,917
Morning.

545
00:20:38,959 --> 00:20:40,041
Hey. Morning.

546
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:41,875
Where's Corinne?

547
00:20:41,917 --> 00:20:44,041
Oh, she's still in bed.

548
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:47,375
I, uh, was up most of the night
trying to calm her down.

549
00:20:47,417 --> 00:20:50,875
She was just excited after
our planetarium trip yesterday.

550
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,041
Sam, I saw her.

551
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,041
She was talking
a mile a minute

552
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,834
and scribbling
in that notebook.

553
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,041
Yeah. So?

554
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,667
So I don't need
to be a therapist

555
00:20:58,709 --> 00:21:00,208
to see that
that's erratic behavior.

556
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,250
She had a bad night,
Addison.

557
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:05,000
She had a bad night.

558
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:07,875
Okay.
Talk to you later.

559
00:21:07,917 --> 00:21:09,625
All right.

560
00:21:09,667 --> 00:21:10,875
Wait.

561
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,166
I'm sorry.

562
00:21:15,917 --> 00:21:17,208
That wasn't cool.

563
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,959
I'm sorry.

564
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,667
I just, uh...

565
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,875
Thank you.

566
00:21:35,709 --> 00:21:38,500
I realize,
I might be sticking my nose

567
00:21:38,542 --> 00:21:40,041
where it doesn't belong,

568
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,583
but--no, actually...
No.

569
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:45,041
I've earned it. Amelia,
are you taking drugs again?

570
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:47,041
Sheldon--
yesterday you hid
something from me.

571
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,041
Sheldon--
you look like hell,
and you're acting--

572
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:50,959
frankly, you're acting
like you're high.

573
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,792
I will take you back to rehab

574
00:21:52,834 --> 00:21:54,083
right now--
I'm pregnant.

575
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,709
It was a pregnancy test

576
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,041
with a little plus sign.

577
00:21:57,083 --> 00:22:00,000
That's what I was hiding.

578
00:22:02,709 --> 00:22:05,041
And I think I'm probably
pretty far along,

579
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,917
20 weeks.

580
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:08,792
And I'm sure you're thinking,

581
00:22:08,834 --> 00:22:10,208
how is that even possible?

582
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:13,959
How could you get that pregnant
without even realizing it?

583
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,291
But my body was all screwed up
after I got off the drugs,

584
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:18,542
and I guess I just--i didn't
think that it was anything.

585
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:20,166
And n--

586
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,041
wow.

587
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:27,041
That is...

588
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:29,792
Just, uh...

589
00:22:29,834 --> 00:22:31,041
Wow.

590
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,083
Yeah.

591
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:35,291
Wow.

592
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:37,000
Well, whose...

593
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:40,041
You don't have to tell me.

594
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:43,041
It's Ryan's.

595
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,041
Oh.

596
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:02,417
Um, this is...

597
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,083
I miss him.

598
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:11,041
I don't even know if I want
a baby, Sheldon.

599
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:14,041
And I don't know if I'm having
what amounts to a crack baby

600
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:16,250
because I was so...

601
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:18,458
And Ryan died.

602
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:23,667
And this makes me
miss him so much.

603
00:23:23,709 --> 00:23:25,917
And I'm crying
and I don't cry.

604
00:23:25,959 --> 00:23:27,291
And I can't
freakin' control it.

605
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:29,041
And I don't...

606
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:31,041
And what do I do?

607
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:34,834
I don't know what to do.

608
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:41,166
I think maybe you should talk
to Addison about this.

609
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:44,000
Talk to Addison?

610
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,625
Addison--
who moved mountains

611
00:23:47,667 --> 00:23:50,041
and sacrificed everything
to get pregnant

612
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:52,875
and failed...

613
00:23:52,917 --> 00:23:55,125
That's who I should talk to
about this happy accident?

614
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:57,959
Or Charlotte maybe,
or Violet,

615
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,083
or your a.A. Sponsor,

616
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:01,500
but I just...

617
00:24:01,542 --> 00:24:04,041
Maybe just not to me.

618
00:24:07,667 --> 00:24:10,000
I'm sorry.

619
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:20,041
Dr. Montgomery.

620
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,333
Laurel.

621
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:23,583
Come in. Please sit.

622
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:28,083
Hi.

623
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:29,083
Hi.

624
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,041
Dani left.

625
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:33,458
Uh...

626
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,500
She left me.

627
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:39,166
I don't know where she is.
She's not answering her phone.

628
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:43,041
I said, "it's my body."

629
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:44,542
I shouldn't have said it.

630
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:48,166
We both wanted
to carry the baby.

631
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:50,083
I won a coin toss.

632
00:24:50,125 --> 00:24:51,792
I shouldn't have said it.

633
00:24:51,834 --> 00:24:54,792
I'm sorry. I'm sorry
that you two are...

634
00:24:54,834 --> 00:24:56,959
Tell me about the surgery.

635
00:24:58,458 --> 00:25:00,583
Well, um...

636
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:02,041
Despite the risks,
I believe

637
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:04,542
that I can successfully
perform the surgery.

638
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:06,041
I told you that.
That hasn't changed.

639
00:25:06,083 --> 00:25:08,417
But, Laurel,
you can't have the surgery

640
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:10,417
because Dani left you.
That can't be the reason.

641
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:12,041
Well, why not?

642
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:15,750
People do things
for all sorts of reasons.

643
00:25:15,792 --> 00:25:18,041
I can't live without her.

644
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:26,250
Hi.

645
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:28,041
Hi.

646
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:30,417
I have a half-hour
before my shift.

647
00:25:30,458 --> 00:25:32,041
Oh.

648
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:33,458
You know, it--it's actually
not a good time.

649
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,250
The--the nanny just brought
Lucas to the park.

650
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:37,750
And I'm rushing
to get ready for work, so--

651
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,125
I'll be fast.

652
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:41,625
Scott.

653
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:45,041
Sorry. I-i--

654
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:47,250
no, no. No, no.
Any other time,

655
00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:48,458
I would be all for it.

656
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,250
Just--just--
just not today.

657
00:25:53,083 --> 00:25:54,333
Okay.

658
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:57,208
So i-I'm gonna go then.

659
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:59,083
Yeah.

660
00:26:11,709 --> 00:26:14,166
Addison, I was hoping
I'd find you here.

661
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:16,041
Hi, Corinne.
Yeah, no, I was thinking
about last night,

662
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:17,166
waking you up--
I felt bad.

663
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:18,583
So I brought you lunch.

664
00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:20,000
No, you didn't--you didn't
have to do that.

665
00:26:20,041 --> 00:26:21,041
No, I know. It's fresh.

666
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:22,291
I went to the market
this morning

667
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:24,041
and--and chopped
the vegetables,

668
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,250
and I didn't forget about you
either, Dr. Turner. Here you go.

669
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:27,041
Oh, I'm fine.
No, you can eat it later.

670
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:28,083
I'm gonna go get Sheldon.
Okay.

671
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:29,375
Hey.
Hey, Corinne.

672
00:26:29,417 --> 00:26:31,166
Are you hungry?
Uh...

673
00:26:31,208 --> 00:26:33,208
'Cause I got--
I got sandwiches, too.

674
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,709
Oh.
Here.

675
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,125
Thank you. Oh.

676
00:26:36,166 --> 00:26:38,083
Uh, Corinne.
What are you doing here?

677
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:39,750
I-I made lunch
for your friends.

678
00:26:39,792 --> 00:26:42,041
I came down after my shower,
you were gone. I was worried.

679
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:43,125
Sam, it's okay.

680
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:44,417
No, actually,
it's not okay.

681
00:26:44,458 --> 00:26:46,083
Sam, you're embarrassing me.

682
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:48,041
No, you're doing a good job
of that all by yourself.

683
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:49,041
Corinne,
is everything all right?

684
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:51,041
Why does everyone
keep asking me that?

685
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:53,625
I brought in some--some salad
and some sandwiches.

686
00:26:53,667 --> 00:26:54,875
You--you want one?

687
00:26:54,917 --> 00:26:56,125
Let's just go home.

688
00:26:56,166 --> 00:26:58,041
Maybe we should talk first.
No, nothing is wrong.

689
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:00,834
I came here to apologize
to Addison

690
00:27:00,875 --> 00:27:02,041
for waking her up.

691
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:03,250
Everything was fine.

692
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:05,041
You don't need to be here.

693
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:07,709
You didn't need to come!
Everything was just fine!

694
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,959
Corinne.

695
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,250
Everything!
Let's go home.

696
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:11,709
S-s--
now. Let's go.

697
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,041
It's fine.

698
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:15,041
Excuse me.
Everything is fine.

699
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,125
Oh, Dr. Montgomery.

700
00:27:27,166 --> 00:27:28,375
Dani.

701
00:27:28,417 --> 00:27:30,166
Thank you so much for calling.
Can I see her?

702
00:27:30,208 --> 00:27:31,667
I'm sorry.
She's already in the O.R.

703
00:27:31,709 --> 00:27:33,041
No.

704
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:34,583
She needs to know I'm here.

705
00:27:34,625 --> 00:27:36,375
I'm sorry. I-I can't
let you in there.

706
00:27:36,417 --> 00:27:37,917
Please. Look, I was an ass.

707
00:27:37,959 --> 00:27:39,709
I was awful.
I just got so mad. I...

708
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,333
Oh, it's just what I do.

709
00:27:41,375 --> 00:27:43,333
When I get scared, I get mad,
but when she gets scared,

710
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:45,750
she just--
she just gets scared.

711
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,750
She can't be in there
by herself.

712
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:50,208
She needs to know that...

713
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,709
She needs to know
that I love her.

714
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,709
She does know that you love her.
That's why she's in there.

715
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:57,834
No, but she needs to know
that I'm here.

716
00:27:57,875 --> 00:27:59,000
Please.

717
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:03,041
Laurel.

718
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:04,750
You said you'd only be
a couple of minutes.

719
00:28:04,792 --> 00:28:06,500
You were more than a couple
of minutes.
I know. I know.

720
00:28:06,542 --> 00:28:08,166
I just--
I don't like any of this.
I don't like--

721
00:28:08,208 --> 00:28:10,333
okay, Laurel, Laurel,
look at me.

722
00:28:10,375 --> 00:28:11,792
Look at me.

723
00:28:11,834 --> 00:28:14,458
I want you to look over there
at the window.

724
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,834
Look at the window.
Who do you see?

725
00:28:16,875 --> 00:28:18,625
Dani.

726
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:20,834
She's here.

727
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:22,834
You called her.

728
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:24,041
I did.

729
00:28:24,083 --> 00:28:26,625
Let's go ahead
and get started.

730
00:28:26,667 --> 00:28:28,834

731

732
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,041
So how is Mason
handling it?

733
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:33,250
When Erica fell
in the kitchen the other night,

734
00:28:33,291 --> 00:28:34,792
it wasn't a big deal--
she cut her elbow.

735
00:28:34,834 --> 00:28:36,000
But, um,
I was helping her up,

736
00:28:36,041 --> 00:28:37,250
and I looked over at Mason.

737
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:39,750
He had been watching, and he
had this look on his face.

738
00:28:39,792 --> 00:28:41,041
I mean, he looked terrified.

739
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:43,041
I mean, he--like this
whole thing wasn't over.

740
00:28:43,083 --> 00:28:44,583
And you explained it to him,

741
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:46,125
that it's gonna take her
a while to recuperate?
Yeah.

742
00:28:46,166 --> 00:28:47,792
I don't want him to become
one of those people

743
00:28:47,834 --> 00:28:49,083
that's afraid
of whatever happens next,

744
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:51,917
and I want him to go back
to being funny and smart-assy

745
00:28:51,959 --> 00:28:53,917
and get to be a kid.

746
00:28:53,959 --> 00:28:56,041
Why don't you just give him
a little time?

747
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:58,083
Yeah? Um, but...

748
00:28:58,125 --> 00:28:59,500
But what?

749
00:29:00,834 --> 00:29:02,250
Charlotte.

750
00:29:02,291 --> 00:29:03,667
What?

751
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:05,041
You said she was great
when you were in Seattle.

752
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:06,250
No, no, she was.

753
00:29:06,291 --> 00:29:07,875
I mean, she's been great
through this whole thing.

754
00:29:07,917 --> 00:29:09,917
But now she's just tired of me
going over there all the time.

755
00:29:09,959 --> 00:29:11,875
And she got me a night nurse.

756
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:12,834
That's very thoughtful.

757
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:14,166
It felt manipulative.

758
00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:15,917
♪ ...love

759
00:29:15,959 --> 00:29:17,041
Okay, you know what?

760
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:18,709
You're tired,
you're freaked out,

761
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:21,250
and you can't take it out
on your son or his sick mom.

762
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:22,917
I'm not taking it out
on Charlotte--

763
00:29:22,959 --> 00:29:24,291
yes, you are. I know you,
and you are. Okay?

764
00:29:24,333 --> 00:29:25,917
You know, listen,
Mason's important.

765
00:29:25,959 --> 00:29:27,041
Of course he's important.

766
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:28,500
But you're--
you're talking to a woman

767
00:29:28,542 --> 00:29:29,959
who doesn't even know
if she's married anymore.

768
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,834
And that--
that feels like crap.

769
00:29:31,875 --> 00:29:34,917
I mean, the empty sex
is just--it's--

770
00:29:34,959 --> 00:29:36,125
it's--it's empty.

771
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:38,959
You know, I love my son,
but I miss my family.

772
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,041
I really miss
being part of a family.

773
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:44,750
So... Charlotte's
important, too.

774
00:29:44,792 --> 00:29:46,750

There's an amniotic band

Corinne.

785

You're never gonna
believe it, Sam.

786
00:30:06,041 --> 00:30:07,917
I've got it. I've got it.
I've got it.

787
00:30:07,959 --> 00:30:09,458
What do you got?

788
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,041
Yesterday at the planetarium,
I didn't think it was possible

789
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:12,500
so I didn't want
to say anything,

790
00:30:12,542 --> 00:30:15,041
but then last night
when I was looking at the stars,

791
00:30:15,083 --> 00:30:16,709
I did some calculations,

792
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:19,792
some research on--
on brown dwarves, supernovas.

793
00:30:19,834 --> 00:30:23,041
I have it, Sam. It's big.

794
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:25,250
It's so freakin' big.

795
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:27,083
Okay, well, slow--slow down.
I-I-I can't understand.

796
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:28,834
You're not making sense.
Slow down.

797
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:30,542
A new galaxy.
Don't you get it?

798
00:30:30,583 --> 00:30:33,041
No one's seen it before,
but I discovered it.

799
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:35,834
It will change the--the world
of astronomy.

800
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,834
Corinne, have you taken
your meds today?

801
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:39,208
Look, i-i-I've got
to get this down.

802
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:41,542
I-I have to write it down.

803
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:43,750
Right? Right? Right?
Right. I-I-I have to--

804
00:30:43,792 --> 00:30:45,959
I have to get it
to the right people.

805
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,041
There's probably someone
at the observatory--

806
00:30:48,083 --> 00:30:51,125
an--an astronomer,
an observer...

807
00:30:51,166 --> 00:30:52,417
Right.

808
00:30:52,458 --> 00:30:54,041
An--an expert who--
who I can share this with.

809
00:30:54,083 --> 00:30:55,834
Can--can we go back there?

810
00:30:55,875 --> 00:30:57,834
Sure. Sure. Sure we can.
But first, why don't--

811
00:30:57,875 --> 00:30:59,041
where--where's--
where's my notebook?

812
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:00,625
Corinne, why don't--
I have to write this--

813
00:31:00,667 --> 00:31:02,041
come here. Why don't you look
at me? I need you to focus?

814
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:03,583
No, no, I need to find it.

815
00:31:03,625 --> 00:31:05,041
All right. I'm gonna call
Dr. Wallace.

816
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:06,583
Maybe he can help us out.

817
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:08,542
No, no, no, I don't need
his help or yours!

818
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:10,166
I need my notebook!

819
00:31:10,208 --> 00:31:12,000
Corinne, I need you
to relax. Wait.

820
00:31:12,041 --> 00:31:14,000
Just calm down.
Corinne, look at me.

821
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:15,750
Don't touch me!
Whoa. All right. All right.

822
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:17,041
I don't need you!
Don't you get that?

823
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,041
I am brilliant.

824
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:20,959
And you have never
believed in me--

825
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,959
not when were kids,
not when I was on the street,

826
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,041
and not now!

827
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:26,375
Don't say that. I've always
believed in you.

828
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:28,041
Corinne. Corinne.
Come on.

829
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:31,875
I could have been
a scientist, an astronomer,

830
00:31:31,917 --> 00:31:33,333
and it is your fault...
All right. Easy.

831
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:34,917
That I have wasted
all these years...
E-Easy. Put this down.

832
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:36,583
All these years of my life.
Corinne.

833
00:31:36,625 --> 00:31:37,917
N-No.

834
00:31:37,959 --> 00:31:39,625
I hate you!
Ohh.

835
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:43,041
Calm down.

836
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:44,458
You're always trying
to hold me back!

837
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,041
Easy. Easy.
No!

838
00:31:46,083 --> 00:31:47,208

easy. Easy.

839
00:31:53,625 --> 00:31:55,583

Get off of me!
Sam, you gotta
hold her still.

840
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:57,083
Every time she moves,
the glass goes deeper.
I'm trying! I'm trying!

841
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:59,041
Push 5 milligrams
haloperidol I.V. Now.
No.

842
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,917
What happened?
Um, she was manic and...

843
00:32:01,959 --> 00:32:03,417
I don't know.
Then she just snapped.

844
00:32:03,458 --> 00:32:05,500
And I was trying to stop her,
and then she just...

845
00:32:05,542 --> 00:32:06,834
She fell through the window.

846
00:32:06,875 --> 00:32:08,834
Let me go! I need to go.
I need to tell somebody.

847
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:11,542
Corinne, Corinne,
this is Dr. Wallace.

848
00:32:11,583 --> 00:32:12,667
Can you hear me?

849
00:32:12,709 --> 00:32:14,500
There are 80--80 constellations.
80. 8-0.

850
00:32:14,542 --> 00:32:17,041
Andromeda, antlia, apus,

851
00:32:17,083 --> 00:32:18,417
aquarius, aries, caelum...

852
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:19,750
Corinne, I need you
to try to focus.

853
00:32:19,792 --> 00:32:21,083

canis major,

854
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:23,291
chamaeleon, chamele--cham--
okay, Corinne. Corinne.

855
00:32:23,333 --> 00:32:25,041
Don't--don't--don't touch me.

856
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:26,667
Don't touch me. Sam.

857
00:32:26,709 --> 00:32:27,667
Sam, Sam--
I'm right here.

858
00:32:27,709 --> 00:32:29,208
Help me, please.
I'm right here.

859
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,667
Hey, Sam, you're bleeding.
You gotta get someone to take--

860
00:32:30,709 --> 00:32:32,041
I'm fine. I'm fine.
Sam, you gotta get someone--

861
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,667
I'm not going anywhere!

862
00:32:33,709 --> 00:32:35,208
Sam, she's sedated.
Sam, look at me.

863
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:37,625
Look at me. Look at me.
Sam, she's sedated.

864
00:32:37,667 --> 00:32:39,333
Now if you want to help her,
get someone to sew up your head

865
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:41,041
so she doesn't wake up
and see you bleeding.
Okay, okay.

866
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:43,959
We'll take care of her.
Go ahead.

867
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,875
I'll be right back,
Corinne.

868
00:32:45,917 --> 00:32:49,041
I'll be right back.

869
00:32:53,583 --> 00:32:55,917
- Hey.
- What happened?

870
00:32:55,959 --> 00:32:57,500
Did it work?
Are the babies okay?

871
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:59,500
They're both
gonna be just fine.

872
00:32:59,542 --> 00:33:02,083
Oh.

873
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:03,750
You are a stubborn bitch.

874
00:33:03,792 --> 00:33:05,709
I know.

875
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,125
I'm so sorry.

876
00:33:07,166 --> 00:33:10,041
I'm so sorry
I left you.

877
00:33:11,583 --> 00:33:13,667
Hey.
Hi.

878
00:33:13,709 --> 00:33:14,959
The surgery was a success.

879
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,500
We were able to insert
the balloon

880
00:33:16,542 --> 00:33:17,709
into your boy's trachea.

881
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,542
And his lungs will develop
normally.

882
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:21,750
We'll remove it a couple
of weeks before labor.

883
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:23,834
Thank you,
both of you.

884
00:33:23,875 --> 00:33:27,041
During the surgery,
we discovered an amniotic band

885
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:29,500
around your daughter.
Oh, no.

886
00:33:29,542 --> 00:33:32,625
It's okay. We fixed it, and both
babies are gonna be just fine.

887
00:33:32,667 --> 00:33:35,125
But if Dr. Montgomery
hadn't gone in there

888
00:33:35,166 --> 00:33:36,583
to fix the hernia...

889
00:33:36,625 --> 00:33:38,208
We could've lost
both of them?

890
00:33:43,375 --> 00:33:46,208
I'm glad
you're a stubborn bitch.

891
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,166
Hey. What are you
doing here?

892
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:07,458
So... um...

893
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,000
So we can't go back to
the way things were, right?

894
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:11,542
I mean, that obviously
wasn't working

895
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:13,750
and, um,
we clearly have issues

896
00:34:13,792 --> 00:34:15,250
of forgiveness and trust.

897
00:34:15,291 --> 00:34:18,375
But I think we could
work through them

898
00:34:18,417 --> 00:34:20,000
with therapy.

899
00:34:20,041 --> 00:34:22,250
You analyzing me is one of
the problems in our marriage.

900
00:34:22,291 --> 00:34:24,709
I am clear on that. That's why
it would be somebody else.

901
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:27,041
I don't think we should quit
without knowing,

902
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:30,709
and if we're gonna quit,
we shouldn't have doubts, and...

903
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,500
I have doubts.

904
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:35,709
Do you?

905
00:34:38,834 --> 00:34:40,417
Okay.

906
00:34:40,458 --> 00:34:41,792
So--

907
00:34:41,834 --> 00:34:43,458
I'm not saying that I want
to go therapy.

908
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,041
I-I don't expect you
to give me an answer today.

909
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,041
I just wanted you to know
that if--if, uh,

910
00:34:47,083 --> 00:34:49,166
you know, tomorrow
or--or next week

911
00:34:49,208 --> 00:34:50,667
or next month

912
00:34:50,709 --> 00:34:53,041
you want to put our family
back together

913
00:34:53,083 --> 00:34:55,667
and you're willing
to do therapy, then i'm...

914
00:34:55,709 --> 00:34:58,000
I'm willing, too.

915
00:35:05,667 --> 00:35:07,583
I thought you'd be
with Erica and Mason.

916
00:35:07,625 --> 00:35:10,834
So did I.

917
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:12,875
You're here
because you feel guilty.

918
00:35:12,917 --> 00:35:15,041
I am.

919
00:35:15,083 --> 00:35:18,041
I do feel guilty.

920
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:20,667
Charlotte, you have been--
I mean, you're amazing.

921
00:35:20,709 --> 00:35:23,834
You--you have been a rock
through this whole thing.

922
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:25,041
I mean, you--

923
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:26,875
you're stronger
than I am.

924
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:28,166
You are...

925
00:35:28,208 --> 00:35:30,125
I mean, the only reason
I've been getting through this

926
00:35:30,166 --> 00:35:32,583
is because I know that
whatever happens, I have you.

927
00:35:32,625 --> 00:35:34,583
And I've been taking that
for granted

928
00:35:34,625 --> 00:35:37,959
because I believe in you,
I believe in us,

929
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,875
so much that I have not
stopped to think about

930
00:35:40,917 --> 00:35:42,458
what it's been doing
to our marriage.

931
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,709
And that is a mistake.

932
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,041
I want you to be sure.

933
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:48,792
I want you to know...

934
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:52,291
You are everything to me.

935
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:55,333
You are everything I want.
You are everything I need.

936
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:58,166
I spent all day
thinking about

937
00:35:58,208 --> 00:36:00,834
what I could buy you
or play for you

938
00:36:00,875 --> 00:36:02,333
or cook for you...

939
00:36:02,375 --> 00:36:04,375
I don't want you
to cook for me.

940
00:36:04,417 --> 00:36:07,417
I don't want to cook
for you.

941
00:36:22,667 --> 00:36:24,000
Mm.

942
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:33,959
Hi.

943
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,208
I, uh...

944
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:40,000
I owe you an apology.

945
00:36:40,041 --> 00:36:42,250
When you were talking
about Ryan being

946
00:36:42,291 --> 00:36:44,041
the father of your baby,

947
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:45,875
it brought back
a lot of feelings, and, uh...

948
00:36:47,375 --> 00:36:49,333
Look, it's my problem, something
I have to work through

949
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:50,792
and not hold against you.

950
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:52,333
So i'm...

951
00:36:52,375 --> 00:36:54,917
I'm sorry.

952
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,291
I still don't know
what I'm gonna do.

953
00:37:03,875 --> 00:37:06,125
Well...

954
00:37:06,166 --> 00:37:07,792
If you decide
to have this baby,

955
00:37:07,834 --> 00:37:09,875
I'll be here for you,

956
00:37:09,917 --> 00:37:11,834
wh-whatever you need.

957
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:14,917
I mean, I don't know
if I could build a crib

958
00:37:14,959 --> 00:37:16,667
that wouldn't fall apart
as soon as you put a kid in it,

959
00:37:16,709 --> 00:37:20,041
but... a friendly ear
or, uh, some babysitting

960
00:37:20,083 --> 00:37:24,208
so you can make
an a.A. Meeting or...

961
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:27,291
You know,
whatever I can do to help.

962
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:30,500
You won't
have to do it alone.

963
00:37:36,917 --> 00:37:38,875
And if you decide
not to have it,

964
00:37:38,917 --> 00:37:42,917
you won't have to
do that alone, either.

965
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:45,709
Oh.

966
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:48,083

Well, we'll order in.

how you felt about me?

980

Because I could fall
in love with you, Addison.

981
00:38:50,166 --> 00:38:52,083
I could buy a house
with you,

982
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:54,041
I could make a baby
with you--

983
00:38:54,083 --> 00:38:55,750
in a test tube

984
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:58,583

985

in my work.

1058
00:42:06,041 --> 00:42:07,542
I want to be the center
of someone's world

1059
00:42:07,583 --> 00:42:09,041
and I want them to be
the center of my world.

1060
00:42:09,083 --> 00:42:11,959
I want them to sacrifice
for me and with me.

1061
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,041
I want...

1062
00:42:14,083 --> 00:42:16,041
Oh, god.

1063
00:42:16,083 --> 00:42:19,583
I sound like some sort of...
Hippy freak.

1064
00:42:19,625 --> 00:42:23,041
Is it too early for scotch?

1065
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:26,041
