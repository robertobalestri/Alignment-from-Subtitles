1
00:00:03,291 --> 00:00:05,083
♪ Ohhh ohhh ohhh ♪

2
00:00:11,542 --> 00:00:14,000
I hate surprises.
I always have.

3
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:16,291
And surprise parties?
Oh, they're the worst.

4
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:18,917
They are designed to make
you feel completely unsettled.

5
00:00:18,959 --> 00:00:21,125
Your friends won't talk to you
about birthday plans,

6
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:23,333
so you think they've forgotten
or just don't care.

7
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:25,041
And then when you try
to set something up,

8
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:26,542
suddenly everybody's busy.

9
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:28,792
And you catch your friends
whispering to each other,

10
00:00:28,834 --> 00:00:31,583
and then they suddenly stop
when you come by. And for what?

11
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:34,417
So these same friends can gather
in a dark room somewhere

12
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:35,625
with the sole intention

13
00:00:35,667 --> 00:00:38,041
of scaring
the now totally depressed

14
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:41,959
and completely paranoid birthday
girl by screaming "surprise"?

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,959
I mean, who needs that?

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,750
But isn't there a payoff?

17
00:00:44,792 --> 00:00:46,125
You're surrounded by people

18
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:49,542
who have gathered in your honor
to express their love.

19
00:00:52,792 --> 00:00:57,000
Uh, no. No, that is not how love
is supposed to feel.

20
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:00,500
Morning, beauty.

21
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:12,792
What?
You don't have to do that.

22
00:01:12,834 --> 00:01:15,625
Kiss you?
No. Bring me coffee.

23
00:01:15,667 --> 00:01:17,041
You absolutely
have to kiss me.

24
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:19,834
I also brought you
the real estate section.

25
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:23,625
I figured you might wanna
start thinking about moving.

26
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,834
There was a guy killed
right there.

27
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:27,875
Not to mention
the woman who attacked you.

28
00:01:27,917 --> 00:01:29,041
How do you know about that?

29
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:31,208
I read your book.

30
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:32,667
I do know how to read.

31
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:36,208
It's looking, um, good.

32
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,291
Maybe make it better?

33
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,834
Um...

34
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,458
I thought you'd be
at work already.

35
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,041
You're early.

36
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:54,208
Hey. Did you have fun
with dad last night?

37
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,208
Mm-hm.

38
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,625
Yeah.
So do you still want me

39
00:01:56,667 --> 00:02:00,458
to wait for the nanny
or are you gonna stick around?

40
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,583
Oh, right.
Uh, no, you can go. Thanks.

41
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:07,250
Love you.
I'll see you later.

42
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:08,709
Have a good day, Dr. Wilder.

43
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:13,667
The nightmares started

44
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:16,250
right when he got back
from Afghanistan.

45
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:19,250
And then
he just stopped sleeping

46
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,667
because I guess
who wants to sleep

47
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:23,291
when you're always
waking up screaming.

48
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,917
It's common for soldiers
to have problems

49
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:30,083
turning off the siege mentality
they've been living 24/7.

50
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:31,667
I was so excited

51
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:33,291
for his service to be done,

52
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:38,291
that I could stop worrying about
whether he'd come home alive.

53
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:39,750
But I did.

54
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:42,166
So now we can move on.

55
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:46,917
But we're not,
and you're so distant.

56
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,917
I've tried talking

57
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:53,291
and I've tried giving him space.

58
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,125
I've even tried
new lingerie.

59
00:02:56,417 --> 00:03:00,500
But sex,
he's just not interested.

60
00:03:00,542 --> 00:03:02,125
Kelly.

61
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,500
I touch you
and you just freeze.

62
00:03:04,542 --> 00:03:08,125
Look, I know what it means
to be a military wife.

63
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:11,041
My father was a soldier,
got wounded in Vietnam.

64
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,625
And I know that the guys
need help when they come home.

65
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:16,208
So I read
about couples therapy.

66
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,166
I thought, "what the hell?
It couldn't hurt."

67
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:22,125
But it doesn't help
if we're not honest.

68
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,041
Sometimes it's useful
to me to see

69
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:27,333
the husband and wife separately,
as well as together.

70
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,542
It can make it easier
to talk that way.

71
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:30,959
He won't talk
about anything.

72
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,166
What do you want me to say?
What happened there...

73
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:36,583
I don't wanna bring it here.

74
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:39,041
But it is here.

75
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,834
Right between us.

76
00:03:42,917 --> 00:03:47,166
I will do anything to get
us back on track. Please,

77
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:49,709
just tell me what I can do.

78
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,834
Couldn't call it a better name
than scientific assembly

79
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,834
for the college of obstetrics
and gynecology?

80
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:07,875
It's hard to believe the acronym
sacog isn't sweeping the nation.

81
00:04:07,917 --> 00:04:09,792
You can put your stuff
in my car.

82
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:12,166
Uh, you know what,
let's take my car.

83
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:13,417
Why?

84
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:15,458
Because, you know,
a man drives.

85
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,041
Seriously?

86
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:20,250
What, I mean, you don't trust
a woman behind the wheel?

87
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,041
No, I'm sure
you're a fantastic driver,

88
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:23,041
but, you know, it's...

89
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,500
What, I might get the vapors

90
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:26,041
between here
and palm Springs?

91
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,250
It's not
a sexist thing, okay?

92
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:28,458
I'm just old-fashioned.

93
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,250
I was taught
that a man pulls out a chair,

94
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:32,917
a man opens doors,
and a man drives a woman.

95
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:35,875
Fine. I don't wanna go
to this thing anyway,

96
00:04:35,917 --> 00:04:38,041
so if it makes you feel better,
you can drive,

97
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,875
but I pick the music.

98
00:04:39,917 --> 00:04:42,000
I got it.

99
00:04:46,542 --> 00:04:48,125
There he is.

100
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:50,041
Hey. Welcome back, corporal.

101
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:52,750
Hey, thanks for telling us
about Dr. Wallace.

102
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,083
No problem. No problem.
When are we gonna catch up?

103
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,667
Grab a beer,
watch some hoops?

104
00:04:57,709 --> 00:04:59,667
Yeah, I'm pretty busy right now,
you know.

105
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:00,750
Okay.

106
00:05:00,792 --> 00:05:02,250
All he does
is mope around the house.

107
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,333
You should just come by.
All right, I'll do that.

108
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:05,709
Okay.
Good to see you.

109
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,875
You too.
All right.

110
00:05:06,917 --> 00:05:08,458
Take care.

111
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,291
Bye.

112
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,667
So you think
you can help them?

113
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:15,041
I don't know yet. Your friend
isn't much of a talker.

114
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,333
He's always been
a private type of guy.

115
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:18,667
We worked together at church

116
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:20,709
on this program
he started for at-risk kids,

117
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,917
but I don't know
if he's a therapy type.

118
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:24,291
There's no type, Sam.

119
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:27,083
And Kelly's right,
he does need help.

120
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,917
Well, he did just
get back from the war,

121
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,125
so maybe he just needs some
time. Thanks.

122
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,583
Okay, I can do
two night shifts a week

123
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,291
and a third
every other week.

124
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,917
That way, I'm clear
for my time with Lucas.

125
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,500
So you and Violet
are still...?

126
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:44,041
Yeah, we needed
this separation.

127
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,125
Is that all it is
or you talking divorce?

128
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:47,500
Mva on the 405.

129
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:49,291
Victim is
a 34-year-old female,

130
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,750
in and out of consciousness,

131
00:05:50,792 --> 00:05:52,959
wasn't able to follow commands
to move her extremities.

132
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,083
Charlotte, is that...?
Erica.

133
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:56,792
I need a c-spine,
chest and pelvis,

134
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:58,333
- trauma panel and ct.
- Got it.

135
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,625
Where's Mason? Was he with her?
He's her son.

136
00:06:00,667 --> 00:06:02,208
One, two, three.

137
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,041
Mason.

138
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:08,125
Are you okay?
He's got facial lacerations

139
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,041
from broken glass
and an abrasion on his chest

140
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,834
from the seat belt,
but he's good.

141
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,458
Where's my mom?
I need my mom.

142
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:26,041
Rick, it's Sam.

143
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,667
I know you're in there.

144
00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:29,917
I see your truck
in the driveway.

145
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,625
Ricky!

146
00:06:33,834 --> 00:06:36,417
Rick. Whoa.

147
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,583
A little early
to be tying one on.

148
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,458
Don't--

149
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,041
Rick.

150
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:46,500
Damn it.

151
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:54,041
Yeah. Hello.
This is Dr. Sam Bennett.

152
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:57,417
I need an ambulance immediately
at 5110 Patrick Henry.

153
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:00,542
We got a probable overdose,
a 25-year-old male.

154
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,083
Why am I still alive?

155
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,709
Well, I found you in time.

156
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,875
We had to give you charcoal

157
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:15,667
to absorb all the pills
that you took.

158
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:18,083
- You shouldn't have done that.
- You can't go.

159
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,625
You're on psych hold till I can
be sure you won't hurt yourself.

160
00:07:20,667 --> 00:07:21,875
Go to hell.

161
00:07:21,917 --> 00:07:23,458
All right, take it easy.
You can stop me?

162
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,625
All I wanna do is talk.

163
00:07:24,667 --> 00:07:26,458
No, don't touch me!
Hey. All right.

164
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,917
Get off me!
A little help here.

165
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:28,917
Don't!

166
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,834
Haloperidol,
five milligrams, im now.

167
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,041
Get his arms.

168
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,458
Easy. Okay.

169
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,041
All right.

170
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,875
C-spine is clear.
No fracture or dislocation.

171
00:07:42,917 --> 00:07:44,041
What's her neuro status?

172
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:45,500
I'm doing a repeat exam now.

173
00:07:45,542 --> 00:07:47,041
What happened? Where am I?

174
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,542
You were in a car accident.

175
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:49,875
Where's Mason?

176
00:07:49,917 --> 00:07:51,291
Mom?

177
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,291
I'm here.

178
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,041
What happened?

179
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:59,041
She can see you
in a little while, okay?

180
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,625
She has a gliosarcoma.

181
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:02,125
Could be causing
the disorientation.

182
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:04,041
Where am I? What happened?

183
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:07,083
You lost consciousness, Erica.
It's normal to feel confused.

184
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:10,083
Give her five of lorazepam
before you take her to ct.

185
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:13,375
Hey. Are you okay?
Does it hurt anywhere?

186
00:08:13,417 --> 00:08:15,709
No. She made me wear a seat belt
and sit in the back.

187
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,709
Okay. What happened?
Do you remember what happened?

188
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,000
We were driving to school

189
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,709
and we were talking
about my book report

190
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,917
and she just fell asleep,
and let go of the wheel.

191
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:26,792
Mason, we're gonna take your mom

192
00:08:26,834 --> 00:08:29,125
for some tests.
You stay here with your dad.

193
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,709
Is my mom gonna be okay?

194
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,542
Yeah, yeah.

195
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,041
Kelly's on her way.

196
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,417
I don't wanna see her.

197
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:56,166
That's fine.
You don't have to.

198
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:58,041
But you and I,

199
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,834
we're gonna need to talk about
what just happened,

200
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,250
what you tried to do.

201
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:06,458
I know this is a hard time.

202
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,041
And leaving the familiar
structure of the military

203
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,667
can be disorienting. Especially
when you've been at war.

204
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,875
It wasn't what I expected.

205
00:09:15,917 --> 00:09:18,041
Of course.

206
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,083
No matter what you imagine,

207
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,083
base impulse
just to survive is threatened.

208
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:27,917
I just wanted it
all to stop.

209
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:34,041
I kept thinking about
being sent home in a body bag,

210
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:37,500
how that would
at least be a release.

211
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,041
Wanting to die,
that's not unusual

212
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,000
given the stress
you've been under,

213
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,875
but it becomes
a very serious problem

214
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:48,834
when you actually try
to take your own life.

215
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,709
Talk about
what you were thinking

216
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,875
when you made the decision
to take those pills.

217
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,709
I signed up
for the fighting.

218
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:07,250
That's what
I was trained for.

219
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,542
I was prepared for that.

220
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:13,291
What weren't you
prepared for?

221
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,917
You know, your reaction
when I put my hands on you--

222
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:17,041
I fought back.

223
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,041
I wasn't trying to hurt you.

224
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,542
You know that, right?

225
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,583
I don't like
being caught off-guard.

226
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,000
When were you
caught off-guard?

227
00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:31,792
Who caught you off-guard?

228
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:37,041
Was it someone you trusted?

229
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,041
I know
there's hazing in the military.

230
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,875
Were you a victim?
Or a perpetrator?

231
00:10:41,917 --> 00:10:44,041
I would never hurt someone
like that.

232
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,125
Did someone hurt you?

233
00:10:46,792 --> 00:10:48,917
Who was it?

234
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,959
It was my sergeant.

235
00:10:58,542 --> 00:11:00,834
What did he do?

236
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,500
What did he do to you?

237
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:05,542
Your sergeant,
did he assault you?

238
00:11:09,542 --> 00:11:12,750
He raped me, okay?

239
00:11:12,792 --> 00:11:14,000
My sergeant raped me.

240
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:26,542
I think we can do without these,
right?

241
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,208
You can't tell anyone.

242
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,000
I won't.

243
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,000
Because this...

244
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:41,625
My life is over.

245
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:45,041
No, it's not. I know
you may feel that way, but it...

246
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,625
Look, I don't think you agreed
to couple's counseling

247
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:49,625
just for Kelly's benefit.

248
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,041
Most soldiers who are serious
about killing themselves,

249
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,125
they use their weapons.

250
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:58,000
So that makes me think
that you don't wanna die.

251
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,583
You wanna talk,

252
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:04,000
and I wanna listen.

253
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,625
You said it was your sergeant,
right?

254
00:12:11,917 --> 00:12:14,000
Sergeant hamill.

255
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:20,625
He backhanded me
across the jaw.

256
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:25,000
He knocked my feet out and
then he kicked me to the ground.

257
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:33,000
He braced one arm
against my neck.

258
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:39,959
I swear, I thought
he was gonna snap my spine.

259
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,250
I couldn't speak,

260
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,959
I couldn't move.

261
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,667
It didn't seem real.

262
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:54,208
Until he...

263
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:59,500
He tore open my uniform
and he jammed himself...

264
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:04,333
I wish I'd died right then.

265
00:13:07,709 --> 00:13:09,083
You were incredibly brave.

266
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,500
What the hell
are you talking about?

267
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,667
I was weak.
I let him rape me.

268
00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:20,083
No.

269
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:22,709
He was a psychopath.

270
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,458
And you let yourself live.

271
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:34,667
Hey, about this morning.

272
00:13:34,709 --> 00:13:37,041
I didn't mean
to make you feel uncomfortable.

273
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:40,667
Well, it isn't about me.
Lucas almost saw you.

274
00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:43,166
But he didn't.
This time.

275
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:45,500
Maybe you shouldn't have
your friend over

276
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:47,083
when you know Lucas
is gonna be there.

277
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:50,041
First of all, I didn't know that
Scott was gonna be dropping by.

278
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,291
And second of all, seriously?
I know this bothers you--

279
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,333
just keep him away
from Lucas.

280
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,542
Hey, Pete.

281
00:13:57,792 --> 00:13:59,291
Hey. I just heard about

282
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,041
Mason and Erica.
How are they doing?

283
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,291
Erica has a concussion,
but no serious injuries.

284
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,792
Mason is pretty freaked out

285
00:14:05,834 --> 00:14:08,041
after watching his mother
fall asleep at the wheel.

286
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,959
I'm so sorry. That's awful.
I know.

287
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,417
I'm just trying
to hang on here and...

288
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,208
Are you having
more Pete drama?

289
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,750
Oh, man. It's just silly.
It's nothing, really.

290
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:20,000
I could use a little silly.
What happened?

291
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,625
Um... this morning,

292
00:14:22,667 --> 00:14:24,625
Pete walked in on me
kissing a guy.

293
00:14:24,667 --> 00:14:26,375
Who's the guy?
Uh--

294
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:28,583
you know, it's a paramedic.
It's a guy named Scott.

295
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,041
From St. ambrose?
The young guy?

296
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,041
He's old enough.

297
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,041
That's not what I meant.

298
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,583
He's very handsome.

299
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:36,041
Does he need a booster seat
in the ambulance

300
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,041
to, like, see over
the steering wheel?

301
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,625
He just-- sorry.

302
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:43,000
Pete had Lucas with him when
he walked in on us this morning.

303
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,041
Oh.

304
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,625
I understand Pete
not wanting Lucas

305
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:48,041
seeing you doing some guy--
I'm not doing him.

306
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,041
I'm-- we're not doing it.

307
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:52,417
We're just
like fooling around.

308
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:53,875
It's kind of like
in high school.

309
00:14:53,917 --> 00:14:55,625
When it was
all lips and hands

310
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:58,041
and swoony, unconsummated--

311
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:01,625
okay, okay.
Did Lucas see you?

312
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:05,041
No.
Then it's Pete's ego talking.

313
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,875
You guys are separated, right?
You get to date other people?

314
00:15:07,917 --> 00:15:09,875
I don't know what
the hard-and-fast rules are.

315
00:15:09,917 --> 00:15:11,041
I mean, what do you think?

316
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:13,041
Think it's crazy for me
to be seeing somebody

317
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:14,583
while Pete and I are--

318
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,375
whatever we are?
If it makes you happy,

319
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:17,792
I think it's great.

320
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:20,041
And I think
you should enjoy it.

321
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,625
It's important for Lucas
as an only child

322
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:24,208
to have someone
to share his toys with.

323
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,000
Oh, my god!

324
00:15:28,917 --> 00:15:32,041
I think I can see your arteries
closing up from here.

325
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,417
Totally worth it.

326
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:34,834
How can you eat like that?

327
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:37,417
Just something I do when
I go through a breakup. I eat.

328
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,500
Anything that's not nailed down
goes in my mouth.

329
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:40,917
I don't know why.

330
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,458
The worse the breakup,
the more I eat.

331
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,834
When my ex-husband left me,
I actively decided to get fat.

332
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:49,041
That was my only plan.
Pack it on.

333
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:52,208
Massive fatness like, you know,
rolls on your back,

334
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,542
really big thighs.

335
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:58,041
I don't know. Like a layer
of protection between me

336
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,875
and the rest of the world.

337
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,083
Ahh. I love that plan.

338
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,959
Well, did it work?
I mean, did you get fat?

339
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,041
No.

340
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,250
I have the metabolism
of a marathon runner.

341
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:10,875
Disappointing.
But this bacon cheeseburger?

342
00:16:10,917 --> 00:16:13,041
This is a Sam-left-me
bacon cheeseburger

343
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,667
and I plan
on enjoying every bite.

344
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:17,709
Oh, I hear you.
Breakups are hard.

345
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:21,500
What?

346
00:16:21,542 --> 00:16:23,875
When has a breakup
been hard for you?

347
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:26,667
When you're usually the one
doing the dumping, am I wrong?

348
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:28,166
Who would dump you?
Look at you.

349
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:29,792
You're the definition
of a catch.

350
00:16:29,834 --> 00:16:31,917
Okay, look, I've never
officially been dumped,

351
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:34,750
but I've never had a woman
try to get fat for me, either.

352
00:16:34,792 --> 00:16:36,333
So I can't be
that much of a catch.

353
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,917
Hmm.

354
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,000
Maybe not.

355
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,041
Two bedrooms. No, three.

356
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:47,083
And at least two bathrooms.
Yeah, i--

357
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:51,917
look, I want my house,
just not my house.

358
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:54,375
Okay. Thank you.

359
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:57,041
Why's it so hard to understand
that I wouldn't wanna live there

360
00:16:57,083 --> 00:17:00,375
after a man was stabbed to death
in my dining room?

361
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,041
Are you okay?

362
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,250
Yeah, yeah.
I just need some advice.

363
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,041
I've been treating
a male soldier

364
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:14,417
whose sergeant raped him.

365
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,208
He's too ashamed to tell
anybody about it

366
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,041
and he was afraid
if he did speak up,

367
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,750
nobody would believe him.

368
00:17:19,792 --> 00:17:22,041
Well, that's a valid fear.

369
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,166
You don't often think
about men getting raped.

370
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,041
Certainly not soldiers.
Yeah.

371
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,041
I did some digging
and the number of male veterans

372
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:29,417
who answered "yes" when asked

373
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:32,041
if they'd been sexually
assaulted or harassed,

374
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,125
it ran into the thousands
just last year.

375
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,667
And it's going up.
That's horrifying.

376
00:17:36,709 --> 00:17:39,250
It's hard to know
how to approach this.

377
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,792
Well, you've treated
rape victims before.

378
00:17:41,834 --> 00:17:42,792
Not men.

379
00:17:42,834 --> 00:17:45,041
Well, rape is rape, Sheldon.
Is it?

380
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,375
You know how hard it is

381
00:17:46,417 --> 00:17:48,667
to get a woman to come forward
after an attack.

382
00:17:48,709 --> 00:17:50,792
Imagine how humiliating it is
for a man.

383
00:17:50,834 --> 00:17:53,041
Let alone
one trained to be a warrior.

384
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,792
Okay. Well, male or female,
the work is the same.

385
00:17:55,834 --> 00:17:57,041
It doesn't feel the same.

386
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:59,667
I'm not sure
you're doing him any favors

387
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:01,625
by being overly sensitive
to his gender.

388
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:03,166
No, gender is central
to the shame

389
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,417
that my patient is feeling.

390
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,041
I mean, he was so overwhelmed
by the attack

391
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:10,041
that his nervous system
went into a freeze response,

392
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,625
his body shut down.

393
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:15,041
Now, if a woman responds
this way, most people think

394
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:17,041
she did what she had to
to make the assault end.

395
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,667
But if a man
doesn't fight back?

396
00:18:19,709 --> 00:18:22,041
He's gonna question whether
or not he's really a man.

397
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:26,083
And unfortunately, so will
a lot of people around him.

398
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,041
Amelia can't excise the tumor?
No, not this one.

399
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:29,417
It's too invasive.

400
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:32,041
Does Mason have any idea?
He knows what he saw.

401
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,250
Wait, you didn't explain
the circumstances?

402
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:37,041
Well, I'm trying to protect him
as long as I can

403
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,291
and Erica
doesn't want him to know.

404
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:40,875
I know he's just a child,

405
00:18:40,917 --> 00:18:43,250
but I mean, he needs time
to prepare himself for the loss.

406
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,041
But does knowing
that someone is dying

407
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,667
necessarily help you prepare?
I mean, he is a kid.

408
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,500
It might just
make him worry longer.

409
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,667
Cooper, can I have a minute?

410
00:18:52,709 --> 00:18:55,875
They know.
What did Erica's ct scan show?

411
00:18:55,917 --> 00:18:57,375
Uh, the tumor's still growing.

412
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,375
Is that
what caused the accident?

413
00:19:00,417 --> 00:19:02,041
The tumor
precipitated a seizure.

414
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,917
Which is why Mason said
his mom fell asleep.

415
00:19:04,959 --> 00:19:07,291
When she refused the treatment,
Erica knew.

416
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:10,083
We knew that the symptoms
could increase rapidly.

417
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,291
It's only gonna get worse.

418
00:19:13,709 --> 00:19:15,041
Can you be more specific?

419
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:18,500
Well, most likely, Erica
only has a few months to live.

420
00:19:18,542 --> 00:19:20,125
But during that time,

421
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,291
as the pressure increases
on her brain,

422
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,291
it's possible
that she could become paralyzed.

423
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:27,041
She could lose her sight,
she could lose her speech.

424
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,959
I'm sorry, Cooper.

425
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,333
Mason.

426
00:19:41,542 --> 00:19:43,500
Is Mason okay?

427
00:19:43,542 --> 00:19:45,166
He's fine.

428
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:46,583
Just scared.

429
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,959
And me?
You're bruised

430
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,542
and you have a concussion,
but no serious injuries.

431
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,333
You were both
incredibly lucky.

432
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,417
A car cut us off,
I swerved to get out of the way,

433
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:02,959
but I just-- I lost control.

434
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,208
Well, that's a lie.

435
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,208
Cooper.
You had a seizure

436
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,417
and you blacked out.

437
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,041
Why are you angry at me?

438
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,834
Because Mason was
in the back seat

439
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,125
and you could have
killed him.

440
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:13,583
Think I did this on purpose?

441
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:17,417
Well, you've refused chemo
and now your symptoms are--

442
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:20,208
look, you will not drive
Mason anymore.

443
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,875
Don't tell me
what to do with my son.

444
00:20:21,917 --> 00:20:23,041
Look--

445
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,458
I'm the one
who's taking care of him

446
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,250
every day of his life.

447
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,041
You've only been around
five minutes.

448
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,041
And whose fault is that?

449
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,208
- Coop.
- Excuse me.

450
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,792
This is
a terrible situation,

451
00:20:31,834 --> 00:20:34,041
but I cannot let you
make it worse.

452
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,208
So I'm telling you
right now,

453
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,041
if you get behind the wheel
and Mason's in the car,

454
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,041
I will have
your license revoked.

455
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,041
You wanna kill yourself,
that's fine,

456
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,458
but I will not let you
hurt Mason.

457
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,458
I don't understand.

458
00:20:53,709 --> 00:20:57,041
He'll get through this.
Okay? You both will.

459
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,041
Maybe I pushed him too hard.

460
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,875
Maybe we're not
therapy people.

461
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:07,625
And the sex stuff--
I mean, I can live without that.

462
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:09,834
I just can't
live without Rick.

463
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:12,333
No, this--
this wasn't your fault.

464
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:15,208
Then why did he do it?

465
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,000
Come on.

466
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:32,542
Hi. Ha-ha.
We're here for the conference.

467
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:33,875
Dr. Addison Montgomery.

468
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:34,875
Okay.

469
00:21:34,917 --> 00:21:37,250
Is a king bed acceptable?
Sure.

470
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:38,875
And your name
to put on the room?

471
00:21:38,917 --> 00:21:40,250
No, no. We're not together.

472
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:42,041
No, no, we're not together.

473
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,875
But you should have a room
for a Dr. Jake Reilly.

474
00:21:44,917 --> 00:21:46,917
There's a meet and greet
in the ballroom

475
00:21:46,959 --> 00:21:48,667
for all
the conference attendees.

476
00:21:48,709 --> 00:21:49,875
Great.

477
00:21:49,917 --> 00:21:52,875
Okay, then, I will see you
in the ballroom.

478
00:21:52,917 --> 00:21:54,709
I'll see you
in the ballroom.

479
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,959
So you're here alone.

480
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,125
Yes, I am.

481
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:08,375
You agreed to see others,

482
00:22:08,417 --> 00:22:10,041
so you don't get
to pick her partner.

483
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:11,083
I don't want to.

484
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,917
I just want her to be
a little more discreet

485
00:22:12,959 --> 00:22:14,500
when Lucas is around.
I get that.

486
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:16,709
And have better taste.
You slept with another woman.

487
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,291
There's a difference between
being with someone for one night

488
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:20,375
who you'll never see again

489
00:22:20,417 --> 00:22:22,041
and dating someone
that I work with,

490
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:24,291
- inviting them into my home.
- Well, Violet's home.

491
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:25,917
Oh, come on, man.
Whose side are you on?

492
00:22:25,959 --> 00:22:27,709
Sorry. I just know
because I've been there.

493
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,917
It's not easy. But this is
what you wanted, right?

494
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:37,959
Mm. Another one, please.
Ahem.

495
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:42,750
Don't judge me.
I wasn't. I'm just--

496
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:45,000
there's a whole ballroom
full of doctors

497
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:46,834
across the way there
drinking free drinks.

498
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:49,041
And you're here alone,
paying.

499
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:52,000
I do not feel like socializing.
Thank you.

500
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,792
Mm.

501
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:01,500
Whew.

502
00:23:01,542 --> 00:23:04,041
What?

503
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:07,000
Are you getting drunk?
No.

504
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:09,583
Okay. So, what if I am?

505
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:11,041
We're out of town, no?

506
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:13,458
At a medical conference.
Nobody knows me here.

507
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,667
You are at a medical conference.
Everyone knows you here.

508
00:23:16,709 --> 00:23:18,083
You're famous here.

509
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:19,375
You're the--

510
00:23:19,417 --> 00:23:21,375
you're the Meryl Streep
of maternal fetal medicine,

511
00:23:21,417 --> 00:23:23,208
is what you are.

512
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,875
Jake. Go.

513
00:23:24,917 --> 00:23:26,417
Mingle.
Go to that ballroom, okay?

514
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:28,000
I'm gonna sit here
and I'm gonna drink

515
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:29,208
because I can't get fat.

516
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:35,000
All right? And then I'm gonna
crawl up to my bed and I

517
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:37,166
am gonna miss my boyfriend.

518
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:39,041
And then tomorrow
I'll be a grown-up

519
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:40,583
and I will give
my presentation

520
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:44,041
on the advances
of high-risk perinatology.

521
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:45,917
Addison.
Mm-mm. Hey!

522
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:48,709
Go, okay?

523
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:52,000
Go. Mingle. Come back
when someone's dumped you.

524
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:55,458
I'm fine.

525
00:23:56,959 --> 00:23:59,458
Right? I'll have another one.
Thank you.

526
00:24:01,959 --> 00:24:03,083
Hey.

527
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:04,417
Where's Kelly?

528
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:06,041
I sent her home.

529
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:07,291
Did you...?

530
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:09,083
She doesn't need
to know what happened.

531
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:10,917
That's your call, but--

532
00:24:10,959 --> 00:24:12,291
but nothing.

533
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:16,041
How can I tell her?
What good will that do me?

534
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:18,709
I can help you tell her,
if you want.

535
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,917
Can't you just
help me manage this,

536
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,041
so it doesn't affect me
so much?

537
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:25,041
Some way I could just forget
what happened?

538
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:27,500
No, it doesn't work
that way, Rick.

539
00:24:27,542 --> 00:24:30,041
You tried burying it

540
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:32,667
and that's what
landed you here.

541
00:24:32,709 --> 00:24:34,041
So, what am I
supposed to do?

542
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:37,041
We can continue
to work together

543
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:39,959
and you can hide the true nature
of our sessions from Kelly.

544
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,750
Or we can tell her
the truth,

545
00:24:41,792 --> 00:24:44,333
deal with whatever reaction
she has,

546
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:48,166
and try to rebuild the emotional
intimacy in your marriage.

547
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:50,750
Neither of those options
sound great.

548
00:24:51,834 --> 00:24:54,542
The process is hard.
But it is worth it.

549
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:57,333
And I'll help you
whatever way you want.

550
00:24:58,959 --> 00:25:00,000
It's up to you.

551
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:14,500
Yeah?

552
00:25:14,542 --> 00:25:16,792
Room service.

553
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,166
Wanna have sex

554
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:32,667
with the Meryl Streep
of maternal fetal medicine?

555
00:25:36,458 --> 00:25:37,959
It's okay.

556
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
No, I actually think
that it is not.

557
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:42,041
You rejected me.
I didn't reject you.

558
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:45,041
I asked you
to have sex with me

559
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:46,125
and you said no.

560
00:25:46,166 --> 00:25:48,208
I cannot have sex with you.

561
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,542
Oh! You've just rejected
me again.

562
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:52,583
Look, I'm sorry.
But I can't.

563
00:25:52,625 --> 00:25:54,750
Am I hideous?

564
00:25:54,792 --> 00:25:57,417
Did I become hideous?
You are gorgeous.

565
00:25:57,458 --> 00:25:59,375
Wait, was it the eating?
Was it all the eating?

566
00:25:59,417 --> 00:26:00,667
Did it freak you out?

567
00:26:00,709 --> 00:26:03,667
Your eating is oddly very sexy.

568
00:26:04,709 --> 00:26:05,834
Is it because you saw

569
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:07,000
my vagina in a medical way?

570
00:26:08,417 --> 00:26:11,875
Hey, wait.
Don't answer that.

571
00:26:13,041 --> 00:26:16,375
Oh, my god. What am I doing?

572
00:26:16,417 --> 00:26:19,041
I'm losing credibility
all over the place.

573
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:21,041
All right. Okay.
This is just--

574
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:22,792
look, I take it back. Okay?

575
00:26:22,834 --> 00:26:24,583
I don't even wanna have sex
with you, all right?

576
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:26,375
You're just--

577
00:26:26,417 --> 00:26:28,625
this didn't happen.
I'm going.

578
00:26:28,667 --> 00:26:32,625
Addison. Addison. Just listen
to me, okay? Listen to me.

579
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:35,041
I can't have sex with you
and I'm really sorry about that.

580
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:37,041
Why not?
Because you're drunk

581
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:39,709
and because you don't
wanna have sex with me.

582
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,875
You wanna have sex
with someone.

583
00:26:41,917 --> 00:26:45,041
Anyone.
Because you're not over Sam.

584
00:26:45,083 --> 00:26:48,041
And you're trying
to numb the pain.

585
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:51,625
You are beautiful
and you are desirable

586
00:26:51,667 --> 00:26:55,625
and very, very hot.
But I can't have sex with you

587
00:26:55,667 --> 00:26:57,208
because you're not ready
to have sex

588
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,875
with anyone who isn't Sam.

589
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,166
Mm.

590
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,667
But it's also just
a little bit

591
00:27:08,709 --> 00:27:12,250
because you saw my vagina
in a medical way?

592
00:27:12,291 --> 00:27:14,000
A little bit.

593
00:27:16,709 --> 00:27:17,917
Mm.

594
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,041
She never should've been
in a car herself,

595
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:25,458
let alone with Mason,
given what's going on.

596
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,458
I know I'm sounding harsh,
but what she did?

597
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,083
I have every right
to be furious.

598
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:31,041
I get the accident
was upsetting.

599
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:33,041
No, no, I need you to tell me
that I'm not wrong

600
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:34,667
because I'm prone
to feeling guilty.

601
00:27:34,709 --> 00:27:38,750
It's actually in my DNA.
But here, in this situation--

602
00:27:38,792 --> 00:27:40,041
she could have killed
my son.

603
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:41,917
Yes, but thank god,
they're both okay.

604
00:27:41,959 --> 00:27:45,083
It was sheer luck. She had
a seizure behind the wheel.

605
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:46,291
I said, "you're done driving.

606
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:47,375
That's it!"
Cooper.

607
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:49,500
I'm not gonna tell you
not to feel angry.

608
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:51,041
It's an appropriate response

609
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:52,041
to what's going on.

610
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:54,542
But you have to realize
that the anger--

611
00:27:54,583 --> 00:27:56,375
it's not just about
the car accident.

612
00:27:56,417 --> 00:27:58,917
Even if Erica never got behind
the wheel of a car again,

613
00:27:58,959 --> 00:28:00,583
I don't think
that'd make you feel better.

614
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:02,333
As long as Mason is safe,
I'm fine.

615
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:04,291
I don't think so.
What you're angry about

616
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:05,917
is much bigger
than Mason's safety.

617
00:28:05,959 --> 00:28:08,083
Yeah, I'm angry
that Erica is irresponsible.

618
00:28:08,125 --> 00:28:11,959
No, you're angry
that Erica is dying.

619
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:16,333
And that's gonna be a much
harder thing to work through.

620
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:26,041
My commanding officer, uh,

621
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:27,375
he assaulted me.

622
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:30,375
He hit you?

623
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
He raped me.

624
00:28:40,875 --> 00:28:42,458
What are you talking about?

625
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:46,041
Were there people there
to--?

626
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:47,458
Were they holding you down?

627
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:51,417
No, it wasn't like that.
It was just me and him.

628
00:28:51,458 --> 00:28:55,041
But how is that even possible?
You're a soldier.

629
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:59,041
He was too.
There wasn't a gang or...?

630
00:28:59,083 --> 00:29:03,041
It wasn't some type of hazing
or something?

631
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:06,375
Are you trying to tell me
that you're gay?

632
00:29:06,417 --> 00:29:08,000
No, he attacked me!

633
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:10,041
Because I've heard

634
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:12,041
about men who like other men

635
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,208
and they just don't know

636
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:15,250
how to tell their wives.
That's not what happened.

637
00:29:15,291 --> 00:29:17,250
Then why didn't you
stop him?

638
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:29,667
She needs time to process.

639
00:29:29,709 --> 00:29:31,625
Time won't matter.

640
00:29:31,667 --> 00:29:34,000
She said exactly
what I've been thinking myself.

641
00:29:42,667 --> 00:29:44,041
Oh, my god.

642
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:46,041
It's okay.

643
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:48,208
Oh, my god.
It's okay.

644
00:29:49,917 --> 00:29:53,250
Oh, crap.
I'm late for my presentation.

645
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,458
I had them move you to 4 P.M.
you've got three more hours.

646
00:29:59,083 --> 00:30:01,125
Oh.

647
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:03,125
Did I ask you for sex
and then cry?

648
00:30:03,166 --> 00:30:05,291
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

649
00:30:07,166 --> 00:30:09,041
Okay. I, uh--

650
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:10,709
I'm so sorry.

651
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:15,083
I had a lot to drink last night
and it was a bad idea

652
00:30:15,125 --> 00:30:17,667
and my sad just sort of came out
all over you.

653
00:30:17,709 --> 00:30:20,041
I am so, so, so sorry.

654
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:22,917
It's okay.
No, it's really not.

655
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:26,083
I feel like I'm always
a mess around you

656
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:27,291
and it's not good, you know?

657
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:29,542
We're colleagues.
I'm not this person.

658
00:30:29,583 --> 00:30:30,917
Seriously, I'm not.

659
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:32,542
We're not gonna talk
about this anymore.

660
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:35,041
I called room service,
got you a bacon cheeseburger.

661
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,041
It got here five minutes ago.
It's still hot.

662
00:30:37,083 --> 00:30:38,041
Okay, but i--

663
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:39,291
we're not gonna
talk about this.

664
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:41,959
Go. Sit. Eat.

665
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:54,125
I'm supposed to
just do everything you say?

666
00:30:54,166 --> 00:30:56,041
I'm driving.

667
00:30:56,083 --> 00:30:58,041
Eat.

668
00:31:01,542 --> 00:31:04,208
We're not just colleagues.

669
00:31:13,417 --> 00:31:15,041
Hey, Dr. Wilder.

670
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:16,834
Save it.

671
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,625
Don't, um--

672
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:20,375
don't be like that.

673
00:31:21,875 --> 00:31:24,041
You were kissing my wife.
Former wife.

674
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:28,208
You guys are separated
and I'm not trying to be a jerk.

675
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:30,000
You know, just shut up.

676
00:31:30,041 --> 00:31:33,458
And know that
if you hurt her

677
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,041
or if you fool around with her
in front of my son--

678
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:39,208
then, what?

679
00:31:44,041 --> 00:31:46,208
Yeah. That's what I thought.

680
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:47,208
Hey there.

681
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:48,458
Hey.

682
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:55,583
So does he stay mad
a long time?

683
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:57,458
Your husband?

684
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,542
Not as long as I usually do.

685
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:02,875
But he is fierce about Mason.

686
00:32:04,083 --> 00:32:06,041
Hey. Somebody would
like to see you.

687
00:32:06,083 --> 00:32:07,333
Oh, baby.

688
00:32:12,083 --> 00:32:14,667
Thank you for bringing him.

689
00:32:14,709 --> 00:32:17,291
I'm so sorry I scared you.

690
00:32:17,333 --> 00:32:20,083
When can we go home?

691
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:21,208
Soon.

692
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:23,625
Mommy's feeling much better.

693
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:27,041
We just have to watch your mom
a day or two longer.

694
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:31,041
And you can stay
with me and Charlotte, okay?

695
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:34,041
And you can play
as many video games as you want.

696
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:35,333
I wish you could play too.

697
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:43,875
Mom. Mom.

698
00:32:43,917 --> 00:32:45,333
Cooper, get him out of here.

699
00:32:45,375 --> 00:32:46,875
Mason, come on. It's okay.

700
00:32:46,917 --> 00:32:48,458
Come on. Come on. Come on.

701
00:32:56,709 --> 00:32:59,041
First he sees his mother
fall asleep

702
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:01,208
while she's driving him and
then he tries to give her a hug

703
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,709
and she has a seizure.

704
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,041
Coop, I get
that you're mad--

705
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:06,709
oh, please, spare me
the lecture, okay?

706
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,041
Violet gave it to me.

707
00:33:08,083 --> 00:33:10,125
I know what stage of grief
I'm in and it doesn't help.

708
00:33:10,166 --> 00:33:12,000
I'm not trying to lecture you.
Good.

709
00:33:12,041 --> 00:33:14,500
Because my son is being hurt

710
00:33:14,542 --> 00:33:17,083
and there's nothing
I can do about it.

711
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:20,041
I'm not sure that's true.

712
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:22,291
Look, you can be angry

713
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:25,709
and sad and frustrated
and a hundred other things.

714
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,041
I don't blame you.

715
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:29,750
Because there's no easy way
to deal with this.

716
00:33:29,792 --> 00:33:32,291
There is a hard way
to deal with it.

717
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:34,041
Erica can try to fight.

718
00:33:34,083 --> 00:33:35,792
She may not be successful,

719
00:33:35,834 --> 00:33:40,041
but she could do it
with our help.

720
00:33:40,083 --> 00:33:42,208
I tried.
You demanded.

721
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,750
But you have to remember,

722
00:33:43,792 --> 00:33:47,125
Erica is angry and sad
and frustrated too.

723
00:33:47,166 --> 00:33:49,750
And maybe what she needs right
now isn't someone telling her

724
00:33:49,792 --> 00:33:51,166
that she has to fight
this fight.

725
00:33:52,166 --> 00:33:53,333
Maybe what she needs is

726
00:33:53,375 --> 00:33:54,834
someone helping
her understand

727
00:33:54,875 --> 00:33:57,000
why she should fight it.

728
00:33:58,417 --> 00:33:59,792
He just--

729
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:02,750
he let it happen.

730
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:04,625
He didn't let it happen.

731
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:08,000
Your husband is a survivor
of a sexual assault.

732
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:14,625
The first time that I saw Rick,
he was on leave,

733
00:34:14,667 --> 00:34:17,583
visiting some high school
buddies and--

734
00:34:17,625 --> 00:34:23,041
I went to this dive bar
with a couple girlfriends

735
00:34:23,083 --> 00:34:25,625
and it had a great jukebox.

736
00:34:25,667 --> 00:34:30,000
And Rick was feeding
every quarter he had into it.

737
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:35,000
And when
he introduced himself,

738
00:34:35,041 --> 00:34:40,000
he said, "I can't dance,
but for you, I would try."

739
00:34:41,417 --> 00:34:44,667
And when I took his hand,
I thought:

740
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:47,625
"This man would never
let anything bad happen.

741
00:34:49,458 --> 00:34:52,125
This man would
keep me safe."

742
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:55,208
That man is gone.

743
00:34:59,083 --> 00:35:03,500
I know that all this
must be a shock to you.

744
00:35:03,542 --> 00:35:07,083
And please forgive me
for even bringing this up,

745
00:35:07,125 --> 00:35:12,250
but if you had been raped
and Rick were to blame you...

746
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:18,333
When I look at him now,

747
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,291
I don't feel the same.

748
00:35:23,917 --> 00:35:27,000
And I know
how bad that sounds.

749
00:35:29,583 --> 00:35:32,000
I just don't know
what to do.

750
00:35:33,542 --> 00:35:36,041
Didn't you tell me your father
was wounded in Vietnam?

751
00:35:36,083 --> 00:35:40,041
Yeah. He lost his right leg
below the knee.

752
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:44,500
Well, Rick was wounded
in Afghanistan.

753
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:49,083
His injury may not be
as visible as your father's,

754
00:35:49,125 --> 00:35:51,333
but it's just as real.

755
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:56,000
Don't blame him for something
that wasn't his fault.

756
00:36:00,041 --> 00:36:02,041
I was impressed.

757
00:36:02,083 --> 00:36:03,709
I mean, if I had been
that hung-over,

758
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:07,000
I don't think I could have given
such a focused presentation.

759
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:10,500
No, I was driven
by shame and humiliation.

760
00:36:10,542 --> 00:36:12,500
Also, the fact
that you promised

761
00:36:12,542 --> 00:36:15,000
we'd stop for another burger
on the way home.

762
00:36:15,041 --> 00:36:17,083
Oh, is that right?
Yeah.

763
00:36:17,125 --> 00:36:20,542
I don't remember that part,
but okay.

764
00:36:23,417 --> 00:36:25,333
Thank you.

765
00:36:26,625 --> 00:36:30,792
For being so amazing last night.
I really...

766
00:36:30,834 --> 00:36:34,542
I appreciate it.
No problem.

767
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:37,041
And you're wrong, you know.

768
00:36:37,083 --> 00:36:39,542
What?
I've been dumped before.

769
00:36:39,583 --> 00:36:41,041
When I was
on that plane to Fiji

770
00:36:41,083 --> 00:36:42,625
and you weren't in
that seat next to me.

771
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:45,417
You didn't even wind up going.
Still felt like getting dumped.

772
00:36:45,458 --> 00:36:47,125
It felt like you dumped me.
Jake.

773
00:36:47,166 --> 00:36:49,792
No, I'm just saying,
if someday I get drunk

774
00:36:49,834 --> 00:36:51,417
and show up
on your doorstep,

775
00:36:51,458 --> 00:36:55,166
fat from bacon cheeseburgers
and demanding sex, look out.

776
00:37:03,083 --> 00:37:04,500
What?

777
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:08,834
What?

778
00:37:08,875 --> 00:37:11,625
I don't want you
seeing Scott anymore.

779
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:16,041
That's not really your call.
It is when it affects Lucas.

780
00:37:16,083 --> 00:37:18,000
That's not
what's really bothering you.

781
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:20,166
Ha. I just love it

782
00:37:20,208 --> 00:37:22,041
when you tell me
what I'm really thinking.

783
00:37:22,083 --> 00:37:23,583
You know what? You left me.

784
00:37:23,625 --> 00:37:27,375
Do you even understand that?
You left me, Pete.

785
00:37:27,417 --> 00:37:30,166
I asked you-- I practically
begged you to stop me

786
00:37:30,208 --> 00:37:32,041
from walking out that door,
but you didn't.

787
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:35,041
You didn't do a damn thing.
You let me go!

788
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:38,041
And now you have the audacity,
you have the gall to tell me

789
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:39,291
that I can't see
someone else?

790
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:41,417
Fine. Do whatever you want.
I don't care anymore.

791
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:43,625
You didn't care then.
Why should now be different?

792
00:37:43,667 --> 00:37:44,834
Got to hell, Violet.

793
00:37:48,917 --> 00:37:51,291
I wanna go home.

794
00:37:53,083 --> 00:37:55,417
Let's see how it goes today.

795
00:37:55,458 --> 00:37:58,041
I don't think
Kelly will be there.

796
00:37:58,083 --> 00:38:01,000
She hasn't returned
any of my calls.

797
00:38:02,542 --> 00:38:05,041
I know that's disappointing.

798
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:09,750
But even if that's the case,
telling her the way you did?

799
00:38:09,792 --> 00:38:10,959
You should be very proud.

800
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:15,000
Your life still has value,
Rick.

801
00:38:23,291 --> 00:38:24,375
Hey.

802
00:38:50,375 --> 00:38:51,917
You feeling any better?

803
00:38:51,959 --> 00:38:53,375
Yeah.

804
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:59,291
This whole thing
has been terrifying.

805
00:38:59,333 --> 00:39:01,375
Yeah.
There's no way out.

806
00:39:01,417 --> 00:39:03,792
I can't make it better
and I can't make it easier

807
00:39:03,834 --> 00:39:07,166
and I'm just...Stuck

808
00:39:07,208 --> 00:39:09,000
in the worst possible place.

809
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:12,750
It is a...

810
00:39:13,834 --> 00:39:18,333
Terrible situation
for a lot of different reasons.

811
00:39:19,417 --> 00:39:21,125
And look, even though

812
00:39:21,166 --> 00:39:23,333
it doesn't take anywhere
near the amount of courage

813
00:39:23,375 --> 00:39:26,166
for me to ask you this
as it does for you to say yes--

814
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:28,750
Cooper.
Fight.

815
00:39:28,792 --> 00:39:32,000
Please, Erica. Please fight.

816
00:39:33,583 --> 00:39:38,792
Look, the odds are long
and it's gonna be miserable

817
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:40,041
and I can't promise you

818
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:42,041
that you're gonna get
enough extra time

819
00:39:42,083 --> 00:39:44,959
to make the hell
that's chemo or radiation

820
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,750
or whatever they do
to you worth it,

821
00:39:46,792 --> 00:39:48,834
but I can tell you this:

822
00:39:48,875 --> 00:39:51,041
What you're doing now
is not working.

823
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:54,208
I don't wanna let you go.

824
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:56,417
I don't think
you're ready to go.

825
00:39:58,834 --> 00:40:00,083
And most importantly...

826
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,041
...maybe we'll get lucky.

827
00:40:04,625 --> 00:40:07,625
Maybe it'll just show Mason
how much you care. Maybe--

828
00:40:07,667 --> 00:40:09,625
I don't know.
I just don't know, Erica.

829
00:40:09,667 --> 00:40:12,667
But please, just fight.

830
00:40:25,083 --> 00:40:26,542
Okay.

831
00:40:34,917 --> 00:40:36,417
Hi.
Hi.

832
00:40:36,458 --> 00:40:40,458
Are you okay?
You sounded kind of--

833
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:47,875
Wait a minute.
Is Lucas--? Is--?

834
00:40:47,917 --> 00:40:49,417
He's with his dad.

835
00:40:49,458 --> 00:40:52,667
So Pete's-- he's not here?
No.

836
00:41:05,917 --> 00:41:08,000
This is Dr. Sam Bennett.

837
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,041
Wait.
There must be some mistake.

838
00:41:14,083 --> 00:41:16,375
Because I have a--

839
00:41:17,709 --> 00:41:19,709
okay. Where?

840
00:41:22,125 --> 00:41:24,041
I'll be right there.

841
00:41:24,083 --> 00:41:26,041
I've always been
the kind of person

842
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:28,041
who reads the last chapter
of the book first.

843
00:41:28,083 --> 00:41:29,291
I like to know
what's coming.

844
00:41:29,333 --> 00:41:31,041
It used to drive Sam crazy.

845
00:41:31,083 --> 00:41:32,500
He'd say to me,
"getting to the end

846
00:41:32,542 --> 00:41:34,500
is supposed to be
a surprise."

847
00:41:34,542 --> 00:41:36,000
It's nice of you to come down.

848
00:41:36,041 --> 00:41:37,542
Most of the people in here?

849
00:41:37,583 --> 00:41:39,291
Nobody shows up
to take them home.

850
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:40,500
Yeah. Uh...

851
00:41:40,542 --> 00:41:42,041
What was
she arrested for again?

852
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:45,083
She boosted the cash from
a convenience store register.

853
00:41:45,125 --> 00:41:47,208
Just wait here.
I'll get her.

854
00:41:56,625 --> 00:41:58,417
I hate surprises.

855
00:42:00,083 --> 00:42:02,000
This is who you came to pick up,
right?

856
00:42:02,041 --> 00:42:04,083
I like to know.

857
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:06,208
Uh, yeah.

858
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:08,125
That's my sister.

859
00:42:08,166 --> 00:42:11,000
I like to know
what's coming.
