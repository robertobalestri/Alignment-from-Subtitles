00:00:06,823 --> 00:00:09,257
- Wow.
KEVIN: Yeah.

3
00:00:09,959 --> 00:00:14,191
- I'm better.
- Better? What, than me? Ha-ha.

4
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:19,199
No. Better. My wounds.
I'm healed. I'm good.

5
00:00:19,335 --> 00:00:20,927
- Ha-ha.
- Good.

6
00:00:21,071 --> 00:00:25,371
I should probably get back to my place.
Oh, there are dishes in my sink.

7
00:00:25,842 --> 00:00:27,742
That's why God made cleaning ladies.

8
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:30,941
Don't go yet.

9
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:34,448
Relax. Enjoy the luxury.

10
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,931
It's quiet again. I hate this.

00:00:53,336 --> 00:00:55,736
ADDISON: Charlotte is driving every
referral from Saint Ambrose

12
00:00:55,872 --> 00:00:56,930
to her practice.

13
00:00:57,073 --> 00:01:00,236
And to top it all off, I'm addicted
to that coffee from the fourth floor.

14
00:01:00,376 --> 00:01:04,608
Do you think they drug the beans?
Because it's just good. Too good.

15
00:01:04,748 --> 00:01:07,148
- Ever think about doing billboards?
- Dell, no.

16
00:01:07,283 --> 00:01:09,444
Pacific Wellcare does billboards.

17
00:01:10,053 --> 00:01:11,816
- No. No billboards, all right?
- Well... No.

18
00:01:11,955 --> 00:01:14,082
It's only a matter of time
before Charlotte's patients

19
00:01:14,224 --> 00:01:17,455
see beyond the French-press coffee
and find a sea of overrated doctors

20
00:01:17,594 --> 00:01:19,152
with questionable ethics.

21
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:21,924
Overrated doctor with questionable ethics
at 12 o'clock.

22
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,393
- You're looking good today, Monty.
- Dr. Lockhart.

23
00:01:26,536 --> 00:01:29,369
Why are you here? Unless...
Are you bringing coffee?

24
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,303
No, I'm here to see
the other Dr. Bennett.

25
00:01:31,441 --> 00:01:33,466
- Naomi?
- What do you want with Naomi?

26
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,339
Well, that's none of your business.

27
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:37,309
- You be sure to tell her I stopped by?
- No.

28
00:01:37,714 --> 00:01:39,875
Yet something tells me
you'll remember.

29
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:45,950
This really is a nice office.
The wooden beams.

30
00:01:46,089 --> 00:01:47,989
It's very <i>Swiss Family Robinson.</i>

31
00:01:53,396 --> 00:01:55,455
I like the beams.

32
00:01:56,232 --> 00:01:57,290
I don't like him.

33
00:01:57,433 --> 00:01:59,799
What do you think he wants
with Naomi?

34
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:14,506
- Passion fruit papaya black tea?
- I'm thirsty.

35
00:02:14,651 --> 00:02:17,142
Well, you're also relaxed and smiley.
And your shoulders.

36
00:02:17,287 --> 00:02:21,724
I mean, usually they're like this.
But now they're like that.

37
00:02:22,091 --> 00:02:23,490
You're being ridiculous.

38
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,225
You had sex.

39
00:02:26,596 --> 00:02:29,588
- You had sex.
- I don't really wanna talk about it. I just...

40
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:32,360
- I wanna savor it.
- Okay, who's the lucky guy?

41
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:35,733
- Hey.
- I just wanna savor it.

42
00:02:39,809 --> 00:02:41,606
Violet had sex.

43
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,506
Oh.

44
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:50,045
COOPER:
Six weeks on the road.

45
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,488
That's a lot of driving, man.
You must miss home.

46
00:02:53,623 --> 00:02:55,284
A little.

47
00:02:55,658 --> 00:02:58,218
But I don't mind being in the car.
I get to read a lot.

48
00:02:58,361 --> 00:03:01,524
I read a lot as a kid too and my friends
thought I was weird. And I didn't care.

49
00:03:01,664 --> 00:03:04,132
Because, you know, it was cool.

50
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,963
We're on the road.
I don't really have to worry about friends.

51
00:03:08,404 --> 00:03:11,862
Have you been taking care of yourself?
Checking your blood-sugar level?

52
00:03:12,008 --> 00:03:14,374
Before I eat. But sometimes I feel dizzy.

53
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,774
Okay, let's see what's going on.
You know the drill.

54
00:03:19,682 --> 00:03:21,479
Okay.

55
00:03:24,554 --> 00:03:26,818
You're reading <i>Three Musketeers,</i> huh?
You like the epics?

56
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:31,450
I like that world. I mean,
I like that no one can tear them apart.

57
00:03:33,363 --> 00:03:38,323
It's 210. Which is kind of high, Porter.
Let's take a look at that pump.

58
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,095
Giving you any trouble?

59
00:03:40,236 --> 00:03:44,070
- It gets clogged. But my dad fixes it.
- What about your mom?

60
00:03:44,207 --> 00:03:48,109
She died when I was a baby.
It's just me and Dad.

61
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,875
- Let's see.
- Ouch.

62
00:03:52,015 --> 00:03:55,314
Sorry. I think you have a little infection
near the insertion point.

63
00:03:55,451 --> 00:03:57,783
It doesn't look like
you've been keeping that really clean.

64
00:03:58,454 --> 00:04:02,356
- I've been trying, but...
- But what?

65
00:04:04,227 --> 00:04:05,524
Hey, it's okay. You can tell me.

66
00:04:06,596 --> 00:04:08,587
We've been sleeping in the car.

67
00:04:11,734 --> 00:04:14,362
ADDISON:
Tell me what I'm checking for here?

68
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,371
- I'm not in med school yet.
- It never hurts to get ahead.

69
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,533
I'm checking your ovaries for masses.

70
00:04:21,411 --> 00:04:23,470
Everything's great.

71
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:28,248
Good. I was a little nervous.

72
00:04:28,384 --> 00:04:31,512
- Do you have reason to be?
- I've had more sexual partners lately.

73
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:35,885
- Okay. More than five?
- Mm-hm.

74
00:04:36,292 --> 00:04:39,693
- More than ten?
- Eleven.

75
00:04:40,463 --> 00:04:43,296
- This month.
- That is a lot.

76
00:04:43,433 --> 00:04:45,731
- I wasn't going to tell you.
- What's going on?

77
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,859
Promise you won't judge me?

78
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,108
- I'm saving up to go to med school.
- Mm-hm.

79
00:04:53,242 --> 00:04:56,803
I've been working part-time as a call girl.

80
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:08,016
- You're kidding, right?
- It's not as bad as it sounds.

81
00:05:08,157 --> 00:05:10,148
- It's insane.
- I have to pay for school somehow.

82
00:05:10,293 --> 00:05:13,091
- Take out a loan.
- And be in debt till I'm 50?

00:05:15,298 --> 00:05:19,132
The money's amazing.
And the guys are really nice.

85
00:05:19,268 --> 00:05:20,963
Last weekend,
one of the girls met this guy

86
00:05:21,104 --> 00:05:23,368
who flew a couple of us out to Dubai
for a party.

87
00:05:23,506 --> 00:05:29,035
- And if I told you how much we made...
- I would still be concerned about you.

88
00:05:29,178 --> 00:05:31,043
I'm fine.

89
00:05:32,015 --> 00:05:34,176
Except for one thing,
which is kind of why I came.

90
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:37,175
Some of the girls think they picked up
something from the party.

91
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,880
- An STD?
- They were hoping you could see them.

93
00:05:41,457 --> 00:05:45,689
They didn't wanna use student health.
They didn't want word to get out.

94
00:05:46,896 --> 00:05:49,387
- I don't like this, Carley.
- Please?

95
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,128
I'm...

96
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:00,500
Give you my card.
I'm gonna write down my personal cell.

97
00:06:00,643 --> 00:06:03,373
Thank you. That means a lot.

98
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:07,412
I'm worried about you.

99
00:06:13,322 --> 00:06:16,883
So Porter's blood sugar is unstable.

100
00:06:17,026 --> 00:06:20,894
And he has an infection
from not cleaning his cannula.

101
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:24,397
I'm gonna start him on antibiotics,
but he does need a new insulin pump.

102
00:06:24,534 --> 00:06:26,024
How long will that take?

103
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:29,161
I need to order a new one.
So three days, maybe four.

104
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:32,468
Can't wait. Have to be in Oregon by
the end of the week. I have a job interview.

105
00:06:32,608 --> 00:06:35,634
Without a working pump, his sugar levels
are gonna continue to fluctuate.

106
00:06:35,778 --> 00:06:38,144
- Well, I'll be careful.
- Well, I'm sure you will.

107
00:06:38,281 --> 00:06:42,445
Being on the road presents a unique set of
circumstances for a diabetic 12-year-old.

108
00:06:44,887 --> 00:06:48,584
Porter told me
about your sleeping arrangements.

109
00:06:49,025 --> 00:06:51,357
You think I want my kid
sleeping in a car?

110
00:06:53,696 --> 00:06:55,994
You know, it was hard enough
losing my job and our house.

111
00:06:56,132 --> 00:06:59,898
And now I gotta live with the shame
of not providing for my son.

112
00:07:00,036 --> 00:07:01,196
I know it must be difficult.

113
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:05,205
- I need this job, Dr. Freedman.
- If you don't stop, your son could die.

114
00:07:05,975 --> 00:07:08,808
It's not a choice, Frank.
You have to give me a couple of days.

115
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:17,750
I've known Carley for almost a year.

116
00:07:17,887 --> 00:07:21,345
She's a nice girl, working her ass off
to get into medical school. I just...

117
00:07:21,491 --> 00:07:24,051
- I can't believe she's doing this.
- She grew up with nothing.

118
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,821
Now she makes more money in a month
than her parents do in a year.

119
00:07:26,963 --> 00:07:29,591
The worst part is that she doesn't seem
to be bothered by it.

120
00:07:29,732 --> 00:07:31,222
Well, she's repressing emotion.

121
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:34,234
It's a defense mechanism
to help her cope with what she's doing.

122
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:38,807
Most prostitutes have low self-esteem.
Many were victims of sexual abuse.

123
00:07:38,941 --> 00:07:41,307
I've met a few call girls in my day.

124
00:07:41,611 --> 00:07:43,602
And we would discuss
why they got into the trade.

125
00:07:43,746 --> 00:07:47,204
And it's not because they were touched
inappropriately or forced to have sex.

126
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:50,012
They don't want you to believe it
because it kills the fantasy.

127
00:07:50,153 --> 00:07:53,179
- Don't kid yourself, these girls are victims.
- Try telling that to Carley.

128
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:54,921
Hey, Pete, you ever paid for sex?

129
00:07:57,193 --> 00:07:58,683
Don't have to.

130
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:04,293
- What's up with him?
- I don't know.

131
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,660
I gotta get back to work.

132
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,600
- So you gonna tell us what he wanted?
- Who?

133
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:16,837
Wyatt Lockhart.

134
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:19,072
Oh, I haven't been down
to talk to him yet.

135
00:08:20,716 --> 00:08:24,174
All right, fine. I will go.

Usually a patient with that type of cancer
dies within a year.

00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,858
This x-ray was taken
when I first met her.

139
00:08:40,002 --> 00:08:41,401
This was taken just last week.

140
00:08:42,505 --> 00:08:44,666
- Oh, my God, that's amazing.
- That's full remission.

141
00:08:44,807 --> 00:08:47,708
Thanks to my aggressive combination
of chemo and radiation protocols.

142
00:08:47,843 --> 00:08:50,539
So you asked me down here
just to show off one of your miracles?

143
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,045
No. No, no.

144
00:08:52,181 --> 00:08:54,775
I brought you down here

145
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:57,886
because my miracle wants
to get pregnant.

His insulin pump is registered

00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,032
Okay, you can't reuse pumps.

That's who I'm holding for.
But this kid's dad... Something was off.
