What were you talking
to Charlotte about?

170
00:08:36,499 --> 00:08:39,730
Oh, she asked me to do her rounds while
she goes to Alabama to see her dad.

after what she did to us?

I see death every day on the job.

It's a part of life and I'll deal with it.

I'm late for my flight.

Cynthia is fully capable of making
decisions about her own care.

179
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,462
You're not at all concerned
that a 70-year-old woman

180
00:09:14,604 --> 00:09:18,631
still recovering from a stroke is putting
herself further at risk by living alone?

- Sam, you asked me to evaluate her.
- Yeah.

182
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,779
She's not depressed. She is not clinging
irrationally to her independence.

00:09:23,913 --> 00:09:27,314
She has legitimate reasons
for what she's doing.

I think it's confusing to Maya,

188
00:09:39,729 --> 00:09:41,754
meeting a woman
that you've just started to date.

189
00:09:41,897 --> 00:09:45,560
- What?
- A new girlfriend could be scary for her.

You have a problem with Sonya?

No, no.

That was almost the highlight
of my day.

Not in the mood.

Cute kid.

Nine-year-old with cystic fibrosis,

Rare bacterial infection in her lungs.

203
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:26,130
Father can't be with her anymore
because he has CF too.

204
00:10:26,275 --> 00:10:27,833
Same thing with her 2-year-old brother,

205
00:10:27,977 --> 00:10:30,844
because if either of them get infected
with the bacteria, they'll die.

206
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,210
So father has to choose:

207
00:10:34,183 --> 00:10:40,918
Let his girl die alone or stay with her
and leave a 2-year-old with CF behind.

What?

210
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:50,399
I've had cancer patients manifest
the same bacterial complications

211
00:10:50,533 --> 00:10:51,693
as those with B. Cepacia.

212
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:54,166
I've had success eradicating
the infection.

Okay, no one in the world
has found a cure for cepacia syndrome,

but you're gonna pitch me one?

215
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:01,874
I know cancer's a lot different
than cystic fibrosis,

I just...

She understands.

00:11:31,374 --> 00:11:34,036
She has agreed to come in
for weekly checkups with Sam

in the rental-car return lane.

681
00:37:49,951 --> 00:37:51,441
I'm still trying to understand this.

682
00:37:52,787 --> 00:37:55,620
I know you took care of us.

683
00:37:56,123 --> 00:37:57,613
Dad was happy. I was happy.

684
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,355
I guess it's your turn to be happy.

685
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:05,664
So you should stay here with Annette.

686
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,765
I'll...

687
00:38:08,269 --> 00:38:09,930
I'll visit.

688
00:38:10,972 --> 00:38:13,372
Maybe sometime we'll visit.

689
00:38:14,742 --> 00:38:16,369
I'd like that.

690
00:38:41,469 --> 00:38:43,937
Daron gave up on his son.

691
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:47,598
He just walked away from him.

692
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,539
Well, it was an impossible choice
to make.

693
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:51,541
It's hard to fault him.

694
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:54,375
The reality of Gracie dying
was right in front of him.

695
00:38:54,515 --> 00:39:01,353
The idea of Julian having to bury him
or not be with him, it's just too abstract.

696
00:39:01,489 --> 00:39:04,014
I just wanted to...
Oh, I'm sorry. Hey, Pete.

697
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:07,286
- Sheldon.
- I didn't mean to interrupt a conference.

698
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:10,454
I just wanted to know
if you wanted to come over later and...

699
00:39:11,198 --> 00:39:13,223
You're going over to his house?

700
00:39:13,834 --> 00:39:16,428
- Pete.
- I'm sorry, is there a?

701
00:39:17,972 --> 00:39:19,337
Oh.

702
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:21,870
Oh.

703
00:39:23,044 --> 00:39:28,038
Okay, look, Pete, Sheldon,
I'm sleeping with both of you.

704
00:39:29,083 --> 00:39:36,512
I thought it was okay, but it's not.
I realize that you just can't do that.

705
00:39:36,657 --> 00:39:39,125
I can't do that, and...

706
00:39:40,728 --> 00:39:42,457
And I'm sorry.

707
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:50,430
Who are you?

708
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,971
He's right.

709
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,308
I'm a mess.

[SIGHS]

711
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,390
We're all a mess.

712
00:40:11,792 --> 00:40:12,918
Don't you know that by now?

00:40:16,197 --> 00:40:21,931
All I know is,
I don't mind finding out who you are.

716
00:40:30,377 --> 00:40:33,005
Oh, hey. I was just coming to see you.

717
00:40:33,147 --> 00:40:34,375
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

718
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:42,047
I just wanted to say that I feel
I have a responsibility to our daughter.

719
00:40:43,457 --> 00:40:48,053
For her to know who I am, good or bad.

720
00:40:48,395 --> 00:40:51,364
Even if that means
telling her who I'm dating.

721
00:40:52,333 --> 00:40:55,166
I never want her to not know who I am.

722
00:40:55,302 --> 00:40:58,203
Now, I'm gonna say this,
and I know how it sounds.

723
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:02,642
- Maya likes her better than me.
- She's your daughter, Nai.

724
00:41:02,776 --> 00:41:06,212
You are her mother.
She doesn't like Sonya better.

725
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,143
Sonya's just new.
