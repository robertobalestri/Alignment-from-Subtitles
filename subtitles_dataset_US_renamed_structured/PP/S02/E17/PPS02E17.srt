Well, I wish I had a good answer.

137
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,525
But the baby does have
11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency.

138
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:40,298
- What is it?
- It is an enzyme deficiency

139
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:43,994
that causes an overproduction
of testosterone in the baby in utero.

140
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:47,300
That's why the baby has both male
and female sex organs.

141
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,498
Karyotype is XX.

142
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:50,871
- So the baby's a girl?
NAOMl: No. It's not that simple.

143
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,841
Yes, genetically, it is a girl,

144
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:56,380
but about 30 percent of these cases,
these kids orient towards male.

145
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,677
So we can't tell the parents
what sex the baby is?

146
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:01,878
They'll have to choose and then
we can surgically correct the genitalia.

147
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:04,148
Wait, you said
there's a 30 percent margin for error.

148
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,225
Postoperative healing is faster
and it leaves the genitalia functional.

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,157
I'll support it with hormone therapy.

150
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,661
What if they choose wrong,
the baby orients the other way?

151
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:15,393
Exactly. We should have them choose
the gender now, but not do surgery.

152
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,162
Let them raise the baby
as a boy or a girl

153
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:20,704
and then when the baby becomes
an adolescent, it makes up its own mind.

173
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:26,898
It doesn't change that.

174
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:31,805
My patience only goes so far.

175
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:37,944
So it's a boy,
but it could also be a girl?

176
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:39,381
My God.

177
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,885
What are we supposed to do?
How do we decide?

178
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:45,650
Well, the odds say that your baby
will most likely identify as a female.

179
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:50,057
So we can do corrective surgery and
give the baby the appropriate genitalia.

180
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:53,260
You want to take my baby, my son,
and cut off his penis?

181
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:56,197
Alternately, you can choose a gender now,
raise the baby,

182
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:59,930
and then when he or she matures,
you reevaluate.

183
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:01,767
And hide this for his entire childhood?

184
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:03,136
MITCH:
I mean, what would we tell him?

185
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:05,574
How do you even begin
to explain this to a little kid?

186
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,976
Well, that not everybody's the same.
That it's okay to be different.

187
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:11,640
But it's not okay. Kids are cruel.

188
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:15,015
One kid sees him in the bathroom,
everyone's talking. Teasing him.

189
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:16,781
I mean, that's what kids do.

190
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,083
That's not the life we want.

191
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,651
We need to make this right.
We need to put this behind us,

192
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:23,421
behind him or her,

193
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,498
and make it right.

194
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:27,957
But what's the best way?

195
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,635
ARCHER:
I like women. I like a lot of women.

196
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:40,177
But I am not married to Naomi

197
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:43,282
- and she is not the mother of my children.
- Naomi sat by your side

198
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,145
while you had surgery.
She held your hand.

199
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:48,253
You're upstairs sticking your tongue
down her throat, seeing her every day,

200
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:50,947
letting her believe
that you two have something together.

201
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,318
Well, I thought I was dying.

202
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,016
You are...

203
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,894
You are asking me to lie for you.

204
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,497
You are making me feel dirty and cheap,

205
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:02,965
and I'm 10 years old again telling mother
that I went out with ice cream with Daddy,

206
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:06,503
when really I'm sitting in his office while
he's screwing his secretary down the hall.

207
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,334
I'm too much of a snob
to screw secretaries.

208
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,738
- You think this is funny?
- No.

209
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:12,207
I think that you're one to talk.

210
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:15,314
I remember something. You doing your
husband's best friend behind his back.

211
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,972
That was once. I slipped once.

212
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,879
Okay, so you're like an alcoholic.

213
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:20,076
You're on a program now.

214
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:23,188
- God me grant the serenity.
- You're so mean when you know I'm right.

215
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:27,281
You know what? I am mean when
I want you to mind your own business.

216
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,992
- I won't keep your secret for...
- Yes, you will.

217
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,928
Montgomerys look the other way
when it is none of their business.

218
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:38,900
CHARLOTTE:
Now, there's a sight for sore eyes.

219
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,097
I got patients lined up
waiting for you to get back.

220
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,902
- Well, that's me. Money in the bank.
CHARLOTTE: I like money in the bank.

221
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,740
What? I like your brother.

222
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:52,207
He's my golden boy.

223
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,152
Beverly. You okay?

224
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,923
Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm fine. I just...

225
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:08,930
- I had to see you.
- This is the fourth time this week.

226
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:10,899
I checked your schedule.
You have an opening.

227
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,198
- Beverly.
- Oh, come on, Pete. Just a quickie.

228
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,107
Okay.

229
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:21,640
I feel like Paul doesn't share
much of himself with me either.

230
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,305
He hardly wants to have sex anymore.

231
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,713
I get home from work. I'm tired.

232
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,478
And you don't seem that interested.

233
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:31,215
But when I ask you what's going on,
you won't talk to me.

234
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,417
I wanna know what's going on with you.
Up here.

235
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,494
GREG:
See, there's your first mistake.

236
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:40,087
Thinking much of anything goes on
for us guys. Up here.

237
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:44,635
You know what I think, Greg?
I think we guys like women to think that.

238
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:48,763
Maybe we think it ourselves, but part
of that is that we don't look at ourselves.

239
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:51,308
Don't ask ourselves
what we're thinking or feeling.

240
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:52,570
VIOLET:
Exactly.

241
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,805
I mean, the truth is,

242
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:58,378
all of us have things going on inside.

243
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:01,213
I mean, right now,
everyone in this room,

244
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:04,845
Sheldon and me included,
have a thousand things going on.

245
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,151
And the trick is to open yourself to that.

246
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:08,590
And to share it.

247
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,428
Well, that's not to say, of course,

248
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,431
that there aren't pieces
you wanna keep to yourself.

249
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,660
You don't wanna lose yourself
in a relationship.

250
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:17,928
No.

251
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,096
No, but the beauty of good communication
is that when you share,

252
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,441
share what you're thinking,
good or bad, you both feel better.

253
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,204
Maybe help each other.

254
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:29,143
SASHA:
Ryan and I used to have that.

255
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:32,648
Back in high school, when we met.

256
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:34,649
We talked about everything.

257
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,945
RYAN: And now
all you wanna talk about are the kids.

258
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,716
SASHA:
That's not true.

259
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:41,520
But I'm there with them all day.

260
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,721
You don't wanna know about that?
That's my world.

261
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:50,293
I know it's hard here in the group,
but talking?

262
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,371
It really will make things better.

263
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,604
Beverly,

264
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,879
I love seeing you,
but this has got to stop.

265
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,713
I can't stay away. Whatever you do,

266
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:09,844
whenever you put your hands on me,

267
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:12,082
I swear,

268
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,858
- it's magic.
- It's not magic.

269
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,187
- And it's not...
- Hey, I've been reading up a lot

270
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:18,387
on reiki therapy.

271
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:21,091
Healing hands.
It supposed to be incredible. Let's try it.

272
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:23,098
I'm not a specialist at reiki.
I can't do that.

273
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:25,169
Pete, you can do
whatever you want to me.

274
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,034
As a doctor,
I can't keep pretending this is okay.

275
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,540
Come on. Just one more time.

276
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:35,909
It's been taken care of.
You can just file it over there. Thank you.

277
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:38,016
- Hi.
- Hello.

278
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:42,949
You know what? We haven't been
speaking for two weeks and I miss you.

279
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:45,249
Don't treat me
like the pervert next door.

280
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,655
If you lived next door
we wouldn't be having the problem.

281
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:49,317
I wanna get past this. We need to.

282
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:51,258
What is it gonna take for you
to forgive me?

283
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:54,423
I don't know, Cooper. I'm working on it.

284
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:25,295
We walked past your wall of pictures.

285
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:29,265
All those kids.
Happy and sweet and normal.

286
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:32,097
And that's what our baby should be.

287
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:33,500
And surgery can do that.

288
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,574
Surgery can give your baby
gender-distinct genitalia, yes.

289
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,142
And we can know?

290
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:40,609
We can stop saying "it"?

291
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:42,675
MITCH:
Great, so let's do that.

292
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:44,981
Can we do it soon?

293
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:47,278
I can book an OR for tomorrow.

294
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:51,412
Afterward, we'll supplement with estrogen
so she'll be as healthy as possible.

295
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,785
No.

296
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:54,950
No, no, no. That's not what we want.

297
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:58,359
It was clear to us
from the second we saw his face.

298
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:01,063
He's Matthew.

299
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,135
But only 30 percent of these babies
orient toward male.

300
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,498
MITCH:
You said you don't know.

301
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:06,935
We know.

302
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,801
LEANNE:
He's our son.

303
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:10,431
You're gonna give us our son.

304
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:13,504
[SIGHS]

305
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,476
I just saw Ryan and Eleanor
in the stairwell.

306
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,712
- You mean Ryan and Sasha?
- I mean Ryan and Eleanor.

307
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,655
They were communicating. Lip to lip.

308
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,991
- Did they see you?
- No, they were too focused.

309
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:31,290
I can't believe this.

310
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,954
Maybe it's a cry for help.

311
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:36,397
An affair in the stairwell after marriage
counseling is a cry for help?

312
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:38,332
Haven't been able to communicate
in their own.

313
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,631
So they do this awful thing
where they could get caught

314
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,502
because they wanna force
the communication.

315
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:44,131
Only, we can't tell on them.

316
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:47,370
It's not like they disclosed this in session,
I don't think the waivers apply.

317
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:50,038
I'm not suggesting outing them.
I'm saying we get them to tell.

318
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:52,377
How's exposing an affair
going to improve communication?

319
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:55,919
So we let the secret keep festering
until it poisons every aspect of the group?

320
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:58,216
Lt'll become the 800-pound gorilla
in the room.

321
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:01,690
As therapists, we need to acknowledge
that gorilla and take steps to deal with it.

322
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:03,226
We don't know what they feel.

323
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:05,660
We don't know what they think.
They could be in love.

324
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,494
- Could be a one-time thing.
- Which is why we need to talk to them.

325
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,102
Look, what I think, as bad as this is,

326
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:14,000
getting them to confess could be
the breakthrough the group needs.

327
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:19,876
NAOMl: I was surprised that you changed
your mind about doing the surgery.

328
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:22,310
Well, I can help them, Nai.
You know, the Thompsons,

329
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:25,178
they are desperate
to change their situation.

330
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,286
For them and for the baby.

331
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,355
And you made a very good case.

332
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,355
That surgery is the only way
to really do that.

333
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,790
I did. But a boy?

334
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:39,125
- The odds are stacked against that.
- Gender's not my choice. It's theirs.

335
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:40,492
And they want him past this.

336
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:42,532
They want him better, and I can help.

337
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,863
Hey, speaking of better,

338
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,064
I was thinking of borrowing Archer
for a few days.

339
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:49,697
A weekend in Palm Springs.

340
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,935
You know,
sleeping late, getting massages.

341
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:54,204
- Nai.
- What?

342
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,606
Do you think that's a good idea?

343
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:57,807
A trip? With me?

344
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,441
No. No, I mean just,
you know, health wise.

345
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:03,054
Oh, he can go back to work,

346
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:06,385
- but going to a spa is strenuous?
- No, no, no. But I mean, you know Archer.

347
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,790
I mean, he's gonna wanna play golf,
tennis. He'll push himself.

348
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:13,591
- You don't want me to go.
- No. No, I do. It's just...

349
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:16,891
- Why rush it?
- Because

350
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,936
I want to go away with my boyfriend.

351
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,602
Like a woman.
Like a woman with a lover.

352
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:24,333
Lover.

353
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:25,909
Lover, I like that.

354
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,478
That's a lot better than boyfriend.

355
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,808
He's my lover. What do you think?

356
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:33,417
- Lover.
- Yeah, no. Yeah, it sounds stupid.

357
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:34,678
It sounds like a soap opera.

358
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,811
- No, no. It's not...
- Paramour.

359
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:47,629
Arch, come on, we're gonna be late.

360
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:52,861
You really need to learn how to knock.

361
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,438
I'm sorry.

362
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:02,274
No. It's just what I get.

363
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,473
- Hey, you okay?
- Don't touch me.

364
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:06,743
- Because my sister walked in?
- No. We just...

365
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:08,716
We never should have...

366
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,885
I never should have done...

367
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,730
Where are Archer and Addison?

368
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,795
Addison's waiting for him at the office.
It's his first day back.

369
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,633
He's got a lot of work
to catch up on, so...

370
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,571
Charlotte's probably holding his feet
to the fire.

371
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,807
- Hey.
- Hey.

372
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,576
Where's Archer?

373
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:37,272
Oh, he got stuck at the office.

374
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,850
I don't think he's gonna make it.

375
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:41,748
Aren't we celebrating his first day back?

376
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:46,085
- Well, maybe I should call him.
- He was with a patient when I left.

377
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:48,389
I'm gonna get a drink.

378
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,158
MAN: What can I get you?
- Scotch, neat.

379
00:18:58,437 --> 00:18:59,768
What, uh...?

380
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:03,030
- How come you're not with them?
- I decided I liked the quiet.

381
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:04,437
Yeah. Me too.

382
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:06,635
MAN: Here you go.
- I thought you'd be in a great mood.

383
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:09,046
Archer's back at work.
Things are back to normal.

384
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:10,978
Yeah, you'd think.

385
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:14,916
What?

386
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:18,248
Can I tell you something?

387
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,324
And you can't tell...

388
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,125
You can't tell anyone.

389
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:24,729
Anything.

390
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,794
- Addison.
- Never mind, forget it.

391
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:31,368
Oh, hey, don't do that.

392
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,336
Don't shut yourself off from me.

393
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:35,770
You don't need to see my crazy.

394
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,542
You don't think I have crazy?

395
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:44,744
Do you feel left out?

396
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:46,714
No. I feel

397
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:51,146
broken.

398
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:56,690
Archer's cheating on Naomi.

399
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:03,032
Which is wrong on so many levels,
but mostly because he's gonna hurt her.

400
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:05,369
He will and there's nothing...

401
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:06,937
I just, I can't...

402
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,674
[ADDISON SIGHS]

403
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,740
It's okay. You're okay.

404
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:17,145
What do I do?

405
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:19,713
People make their own choices.

406
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,277
You can't do it for them.

407
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:28,450
NAOMl:
Yes, well, that is...

408
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,391
- But... I don't think...
- Sorry I'm late.

409
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:32,656
Hey. Oh, you're here.

410
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:57,815
You wanna talk about this?

411
00:20:57,956 --> 00:20:59,480
- Will it help?
- No.

412
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,252
Then what's the point?

413
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:03,793
- Addy.
- Don't.

414
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:06,392
Don't be this guy, Archer.

415
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:10,126
Don't be this limited, short-sighted,
not-good-enough guy.

416
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,999
- Please.
- Look, I like Naomi. I really do.

417
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:14,571
It's just...

418
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,665
I'm sorry.

419
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:18,742
Don't apologize to me.
Apologize to her.

420
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:21,141
You know, I hated him.
I hated Dad for years.

421
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,907
Past tense. "Hated."
Do you love him now?

422
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:26,677
- Now he's your hero?
- I am him, Addison. I am him.

423
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:29,150
Like father, like son.
Whatever he passed down to me.

424
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,586
I'm missing a gene.
You don't think I wanna be better?

425
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:33,657
You don't think I wanna be
a good man in a storm?

426
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,783
- I don't have it in me.
- That's a cop-out.

427
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:37,690
Maybe it is.

428
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:39,763
But it's honest.

429
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,628
Do you usually do this?

430
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:47,830
Have us come in alone?

431
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,134
Sheldon's never done this before.

432
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:55,076
Well, sometimes I find things
that are best served outside the group.

433
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,852
What's going on?

434
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:06,350
I saw you in the stairwell yesterday.

435
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,594
- Oh, God.
- It just happened.

436
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:15,598
After the first session,
Ryan and I, we started talking

437
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:17,259
and it was easy.

438
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:20,860
Everything you said about communication,
that we couldn't do with our spouses,

439
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,031
the two of us could.

440
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:26,835
Are you gonna tell?

441
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:30,277
You can't do that, can you?

442
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:34,117
You might think that keeping this a secret
is a good thing

443
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:35,583
and that holding it in is better.

444
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,885
But I think it would be best
for both of you to go home.

445
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,686
Talk to your spouses

446
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:43,556
and work together
to try to figure this out.

447
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,323
VIOLET: You came to the group
to work on your marriages.

448
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,459
To make things better.

449
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,398
Is that still what you want?
To work on your marriages?

450
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:54,662
We wanna be together.

451
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:59,175
And if telling our spouses is the first step
to a new life together,

452
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:02,037
we'll do it.

453
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:10,279
And instead of wanting to save their
marriage, they're just willing to walk away.

454
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:12,219
NAOMl:
Well, maybe it's a good thing.

455
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:15,019
- If it's not working, why force it?
- I don't know what's worse.

456
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,687
To be faithful in a loveless marriage
or to cheat to find true love.

457
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,855
ADDISON: What are we talking about?
- Keeping secrets.

458
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:22,993
Well, it's tough.

459
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:25,626
- Keeping people's secrets.
- That's why it's better not to.

460
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:28,535
I mean, if you care about that person,
you just tell them.

461
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:31,141
- Bottom line.
SAM: Yeah, especially in a marriage.

462
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:33,471
The bond between a husband
and wife is sacrosanct.

463
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:36,274
Like the bond
between a parent and a child.

464
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:41,444
VIOLET: How is the Thompson baby?
- I'm operating today.

465
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:42,644
The parents want a boy.

466
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,346
I think it's important to respect that.

467
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:47,356
- What about what that kid wants?
- He's young to make that decision.

468
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:49,221
I hope you make the right one.

469
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,191
SAM:
Are you hungry?

470
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:54,898
Frustrated.

471
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:56,728
Charlotte acts like I'm cheating on her.

472
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:59,735
I mean, here I am trying to be
the good guy, all I get is guilt.

473
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:03,839
I'm really not the person
you should talk to about this, Cooper.

474
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:05,033
Talk to her.

475
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:11,112
WOMAN [OVER SPEAKER]:
<i>Dr. Klass, call Recovery.</i>

476
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:14,116
<i>Dr. Klass, call Recovery.</i>

477
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:18,183
Charlotte, we need to talk.

478
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:22,220
Charlotte. Stop. Hey.

479
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,659
Hey, stop treating me
like I've done something horrible.

480
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:28,595
Like taking care of my friend
is cheating on you.

481
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:32,101
- You don't know...
- You don't know.

482
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:34,501
All I've ever wanted to do
is make you happy.

483
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,199
I can't do that if you're shutting me out.

484
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:43,541
Please.

485
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,816
NAOMl:
Addison?

486
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:56,351
Addison.

487
00:24:57,362 --> 00:25:00,525
ADDISON: Oh, hey.
NAOMl: You ready to do this?

488
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,528
Hey, I'm sorry we left so early
last night. It's...

489
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:09,299
I just... I think Archer's just so glad
to be healthy again that we...

490
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:10,798
[LAUGHS]

491
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:12,569
I'm sorry, never mind, I know.

492
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:14,906
Some details
I just have to keep to myself.

493
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:16,536
Oh, I asked him about going away.

494
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,706
And we're thinking
maybe next weekend.

495
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,910
Oh, and I came up with a name
for him. Beau.

496
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,048
He's my beau.

497
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,487
You know,
it's simple and it's a little old-fashioned.

498
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:28,889
But still, I think it's better than boyfriend.

499
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,654
I can't do this.

500
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:32,554
NAOMl:
Addison. Addison.

501
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:44,335
Is something wrong?
It was gonna be hours.

502
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:46,740
I can't do this.
I'm sorry. I can't do the surgery.

503
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,676
- Is the baby sick?
- No, no, no. The baby is fine.

504
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:51,338
That's just it.

505
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:52,810
The baby is fine.

506
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:55,749
But you, Naomi,
we all want to change the baby.

507
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,479
To a him. Into something that he's not.

508
00:25:57,622 --> 00:25:59,783
So you just want to leave him a freak.

509
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:03,122
- He's not a freak.
- Well, he is if they don't do the surgery.

510
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:05,092
Please, you've gotta do this.
Give us our son.

511
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,629
I can't. I can't do it. I won't.

512
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,427
Okay, well,

513
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:16,002
if you want a boy,
you can still have a boy.

514
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:18,701
You can take him home
and call him Matthew.

515
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:21,539
And love him and accept him
for what he is.

516
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,910
And raise him
so that when the time comes,

517
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:26,609
- he'll make the choice that's right for him.
- And meanwhile,

518
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,184
what? Our kid should hide?

519
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,550
Be embarrassed? Humiliated? What?

520
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:32,953
- We could protect him.
- What do you think it'll be like

521
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:36,185
- to be a 6-year-old boy with a vagina?
- Imagine being a 20-year-old woman

522
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:37,761
without one.

523
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:39,825
We'll find another surgeon.

524
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:42,058
- Someone who will do this.
- No.

525
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:47,405
She's right.
We need to think about this.

526
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:50,804
It is too important
to just hurt him this way.

527
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:55,709
Him. That's right. Him.
That, in there, our baby, it's a him.

528
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:57,981
And leaving him like this, it's not right.

529
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:01,080
I don't wanna make a mistake.

530
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:02,709
Look, well, I can't. I can't do this.

531
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:06,021
All right, I can't do this.
I can't take that home.

532
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:07,886
And hope it turns out right.

533
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:09,653
I can't. I can't...

534
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:13,024
I can't change that diaper
every day and...

535
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,364
I can't do this.

536
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:20,694
- I can't. I can't.
- Mitch.

537
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:23,268
Mitch.

538
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:37,284
Did yesterday's session
bring up anything?

539
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:42,786
Ryan came to me.

540
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:45,053
He said he wanted to talk.

541
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:48,290
I was surprised. It had been so long.

542
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:51,425
And he had this look on his face.

543
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:54,766
And he started to tell me
all the things that were wrong

544
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:56,464
and how he was feeling.

545
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:58,974
And I guess

546
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:02,102
it's not all him. It's me.

547
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:04,881
It's us.

548
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:07,684
We talked for hours.

549
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:09,616
And then

550
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:11,244
we had sex.

551
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:14,085
- Oh, Sasha.
SASHA: We did.

552
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:16,389
We can talk about it.

553
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:20,931
For the first time in a long time,
we had sex and it was great.

554
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:24,802
Something about it felt new

555
00:28:24,936 --> 00:28:27,427
and better

556
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:28,630
and different.

557
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:32,004
I guess because I felt
like he was there.

558
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:47,424
Ryan, I know
that this might be uncomfortable,

559
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:51,427
but it might be helpful
if you could tell us how you feel.

560
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:59,534
Well, it wasn't
what I thought I'd be saying.

561
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:04,173
But we talked
and I remembered what we had.

562
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:06,473
And what we can still have.

563
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:15,676
I had an affair.

564
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:27,855
What the hell just happened
back there?

565
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:30,593
I don't understand what happened.
You agreed to do the surgery...

566
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:33,533
- This isn't about the surgery.
- Well, what is it?

567
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:38,771
I thought
that he could be a different person.

568
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:41,003
After everything he went through,
after almost dying.

569
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:44,673
I thought
he could be a different person.

570
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:48,978
I wanted to believe that so much
that I almost cut into a baby

571
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,680
to convince myself
that people can change.

572
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:54,690
That I can change them.
But I can't.

573
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,553
Archer's cheating on you.

574
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:04,660
And I'm sorry. Nai.

575
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:18,747
Who was it? Someone I know?

576
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,378
SHELDON:
This may be hard to hear, Paul,

577
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:24,045
but sometimes an affair
isn't moving away, it's reaching out.

578
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:26,051
For the wrong thing.

579
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:29,627
It's reaching out towards someone
who seems like an answer.

580
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,553
But they're not.

581
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:36,429
They're a crutch, a way to fill the void
of something that's missing.

582
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:38,229
The person that you really love.

583
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:41,901
The person I really love?

584
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:45,769
I thought I'd lost that with Sasha.

585
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:49,436
I was in the same boat you are.

586
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:52,213
Maybe we all are in the same boat.

587
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,410
But isn't it...?
Isn't it worth another chance?

588
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:02,125
I think I made a mistake, Paul.

589
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,921
- I don't care.
VIOLET: But you should.

590
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:06,889
Because if you want anything
to change, you have to work at it.

591
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,828
You haven't shared yourself

592
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:12,561
and I understand that.

593
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,036
How can you share yourself
if you don't know what you think

594
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:16,572
or you don't know what you feel.

595
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:20,041
And it makes you feel pathetic
and crazy and bad.

596
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:22,373
And you think that if you share that,

597
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:24,845
then they might decide

598
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:28,749
that you're as crazy as you feel you are.

599
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:32,815
But we're... All of us, we're human.

600
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:34,686
We make mistakes.

601
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:36,387
I have.

602
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:39,587
I know Eleanor has
and I bet you have too.

603
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:41,990
But if you can talk to her about this,

604
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:44,693
if you can open up with her,

605
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:49,637
then I really think you can work
through this and make things better.

606
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,274
You know what?

607
00:31:58,149 --> 00:31:59,946
I'm done.

608
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,293
I'm afraid that Carol will leave me,

609
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,131
just like Paul did.

610
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,163
When you come home at night

611
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:25,333
and you talk about
how great the guys are you work with,

612
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:27,569
I feel small.

613
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:29,570
Insignificant.

614
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:32,740
I know who I am and what I am.

615
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:36,849
But it scares me
that you'll realize you could do better.

616
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,059
You should have talked to me.

617
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:49,223
Because I want you.

618
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,862
I love you.

619
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:11,252
This has got to stop.

620
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:14,483
When I'm with you, what you do to me.

621
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:16,819
These days, it's the best I ever feel.

622
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:19,930
- Look, Beverly...
- I want to try this new herb.

623
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:22,862
Red clover.
It's supposed to put years on your life.

624
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,366
And take years off your face.

625
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:25,560
Bev.

626
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:27,671
- I know what you're gonna say.
- You have cancer.

627
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:30,230
I know that.

628
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,672
Stage two lymphoma.

629
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,145
I know that.

630
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:37,141
God, I know that.
You don't have to say it.

631
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:38,908
PETE:
I do.

632
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,853
I love that you come to see me.

633
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,622
You're one of my favorite patients.

634
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,786
But I've referred you to the best oncologist
in town and you won't go.

635
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:53,055
You have to go.

636
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,665
I tried. I made it to the waiting room.

637
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,360
But those people are so frail.

638
00:33:58,503 --> 00:34:01,529
I mean, they're bald.
Or worse, bad wigs.

639
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:03,799
Chapped skin.

640
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:06,836
- I can't be like that.
- They're sick, like you are.

641
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:10,812
But they're getting the right treatment.
They are trying to get better.

642
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:12,506
- What if they don't?
- Then they don't.

643
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:15,084
But their eyes are wide open.
They know they can't cheat fate.

644
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,278
They're fighting.
The way you should be fighting.

645
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,717
I don't want to be the one

646
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:22,993
who dies.

647
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:25,486
Then be the one who lives.

648
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:44,978
He's gone.

649
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:48,281
I'm sorry.

650
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,334
I'm going home to New York.

651
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:15,673
Are you saying goodbye to Naomi?

652
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:19,807
Don't tell her about Charlotte.
That would hurt her.

653
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:23,409
Archer, you leaving without a word?
That will hurt her. Don't do this.

654
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:25,351
Bye, Addy.

655
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:30,022
I love you.

656
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,375
I wanted to see how you were doing.

657
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:53,650
Mitch is gone.

658
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:59,120
But I don't know
how I'm gonna do this alone.

659
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:00,588
I went with blue.

660
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,957
Matthew.

661
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:08,224
Mitch was so excited.

662
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:11,625
You know,

663
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:15,468
I know you want to save him

664
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:18,234
from all that he'll go through,

665
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:20,367
but I think you're doing the right thing.

666
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,606
I hope so.

667
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:33,283
You do not get to cut and run

668
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:35,585
because you're afraid of not knowing
what comes next.

669
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:37,785
There are people that love you
and that need you.

670
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:39,294
Why are you here yelling at me?

671
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:44,163
Because it is not okay to just walk away
and pretend like it doesn't matter.

672
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:46,634
I mean, to have something incredible
and not even see

673
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:48,739
what is right in front of your face.

674
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,363
Your wife loves you.

675
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:54,569
And you have a healthy child who,
yeah, has some issues, but so what?

676
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,111
Everybody has issues.

677
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:58,707
You need to be there for them.

678
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:00,976
- Love them.
- Well, I don't know if I can.

679
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:02,244
Grow up.

680
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,786
God, be a man.

681
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:10,459
You need to not hurt the woman
who loves you.

682
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:27,945
Well, nice surprise.

683
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:31,772
I slept with Archer Montgomery.

684
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:40,285
I just thought you should know.

685
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:42,117
No. No.

686
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,627
You don't get to just walk away from me
after telling me that.

687
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:48,659
How dare you? How dare you do this?

688
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:50,664
- That's just the way I am.
- Oh, that's crap.

689
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:53,463
You did the one thing
you could to push me away.

690
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,504
To make me make the choice
and not you.

691
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,541
Guess what, Charlotte? That's not
gonna work. I'm not going anywhere.

692
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:01,577
You wanna sleep with some guy
to hurt me? To make me back off?

693
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:04,374
Too bad. I'm here.

694
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:06,142
I'm storming the freaking castle for you.

695
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,945
And you so underestimated me.

696
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:10,280
What? You thought I was so weak
that I'm gonna walk away

697
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:13,549
because my pride got wounded?

698
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:19,360
You are mine.

699
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:23,998
And I'm not walking away
because you're scared.

700
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:38,540
God, I'm so sorry.

701
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:43,879
I'm so sorry.

702
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:48,785
This one,

703
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,919
I can overlook.

704
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:52,723
This one.

705
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:56,390
But you have to think long and hard about
testing me because next time, I'm gone.

706
00:38:57,401 --> 00:38:59,232
You'd better dig deep, Charlotte.

707
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,769
Dig deep in your soul

708
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:02,463
and grow the hell up

709
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:04,096
and be in this relationship.

710
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:07,404
Right now.

711
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,047
Okay?

712
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:27,824
I wanted to thank you for what you said.

713
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:30,934
- I don't think I got through to Paul.
- You got through to Greg and Carol.

714
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:33,798
And we saved a marriage. Maybe two.

715
00:39:34,605 --> 00:39:38,166
Trying to figure this stuff out
is hard, Violet.

716
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:41,403
I mean, they come to us,
they're on the brink already.

717
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:43,911
If we turn two out of three,

718
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,081
I say we won.

719
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:51,812
It was a shock.

720
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:53,753
I mean, the pregnancy.

721
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:57,788
It was unplanned.

722
00:39:57,928 --> 00:40:00,897
And I don't often do unplanned.

723
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:05,265
So this whole thing
is unfamiliar territory for me.

724
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,633
And I'm just trying

725
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,465
to roll with it the best way I can.

726
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:13,474
I know, Violet.

727
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:16,506
And I don't expect you to confide in me.

728
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,605
But if you do need me,

729
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,317
I'm here for you.

730
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:34,497
[MOANING]

731
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:38,264
SONYA:
You taste good.

732
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:40,634
Really good.

733
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:45,899
SAM:
Oh, Naomi.

734
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,306
What's wrong?

735
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,942
What did you just call me?

736
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,153
What?

737
00:40:58,522 --> 00:40:59,853
You just called me Naomi.

738
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:02,324
No, I didn't.

739
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:05,358
- No, I didn't.
- You did.

740
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:23,709
You warned me.

741
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:28,578
I thought...

742
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:34,212
I really thought Archer had changed.

743
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:36,325
Or that he could.

744
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:41,497
I'm sorry.

745
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:06,080
I know he's your brother

746
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:08,285
and I know I shouldn't...

747
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:09,585
It's not right to say it.

748
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:11,319
Say it.

749
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:14,791
I hate him.

750
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,626
Me too.
