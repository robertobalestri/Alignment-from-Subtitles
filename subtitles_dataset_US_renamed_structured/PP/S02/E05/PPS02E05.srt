NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on</i> Private <i>Practice:</i>

2
00:00:03,887 --> 00:00:06,913
- We're all gonna vote.
- You choose which one runs the practice.

3
00:00:07,057 --> 00:00:09,116
- Congratulations, boss.
- Hello, Peter.

4
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:10,487
- Meg?
VIOLET: How do you know Pete?

5
00:00:10,727 --> 00:00:11,921
MEG:
We were residents together.

6
00:00:12,062 --> 00:00:13,427
Again with the talking?

7
00:00:13,563 --> 00:00:15,428
I'm serious.
We're gonna get to know each other.

8
00:00:22,505 --> 00:00:24,166
I got it.

9
00:00:24,307 --> 00:00:25,831
[LAUGHS]

10
00:00:25,975 --> 00:00:27,340
I got it.

11
00:00:27,477 --> 00:00:28,967
Oh, sorry.

12
00:00:29,245 --> 00:00:30,610
KEVIN:
Are you still working?

13
00:00:30,747 --> 00:00:32,339
ADDISON:
Okay, I figured it out.

14
00:00:32,482 --> 00:00:38,045
The magic number: $487,000.

15
00:00:38,188 --> 00:00:42,318
If I can find $487,000, it's enough
to get the practice rolling again.

16
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,757
I don't know how,
but I'm gonna find that money.

17
00:00:44,894 --> 00:00:49,354
I will find that money
because I am a good leader.

18
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,691
I wanna be interested and excited

19
00:00:51,835 --> 00:00:54,804
but it's been two weeks
of me sleeping under paperwork.

20
00:00:54,938 --> 00:00:57,736
So pretend this is me interested
because I'm very tired.

21
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,904
- Sleep with me.
- Uh-huh.

22
00:01:00,043 --> 00:01:02,273
Ha-ha. No.

23
00:01:02,512 --> 00:01:04,742
Sleep with me.

24
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,228
Don't tell me that's daylight.

25
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:26,698
You are a horrible, corrupting influence.

26
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:32,205
- Oh, what a shame.
- All the sex?

27
00:01:32,809 --> 00:01:34,071
No.

28
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,940
What all those cigarettes
are doing to that gorgeous body.

29
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,514
May I remind you,
my French inhale turned you on.

30
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:42,812
Yeah, we're not 22 anymore.
We're doctors.

31
00:01:42,952 --> 00:01:45,147
We know what smoking does
to gorgeous bodies.

32
00:01:45,288 --> 00:01:46,880
Cancer. Heart attacks.

33
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,456
Well, I know what I enjoy.

34
00:01:48,591 --> 00:01:51,082
Like you, for instance,
when you're not talking about this.

35
00:01:51,227 --> 00:01:53,695
Well, make me stop talking.

36
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:00,229
Goodbye, rubber rompers.

37
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:04,200
Goodbye, my little latex safety nets.

38
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,671
Sex without condoms.

39
00:02:05,809 --> 00:02:07,606
How grown-up are we,
getting HIV tests?

40
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,268
Using just the pill.

41
00:02:09,412 --> 00:02:11,243
COOPER:
It's the next big step in our relationship.

42
00:02:11,981 --> 00:02:13,539
We're two teenagers,

43
00:02:14,017 --> 00:02:17,953
busting at the seams with hormones,

44
00:02:18,087 --> 00:02:23,115
stuck for the summer in our <i>Footloose,</i>

45
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:26,353
no-dancing, conservative town

46
00:02:26,496 --> 00:02:31,058
where my daddy preaches
with his loaded shotgun under the pulpit.

47
00:02:31,201 --> 00:02:33,897
And then one night, in the cornfield...

48
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:39,432
What? What happens in the cornfield?

49
00:02:39,642 --> 00:02:42,805
After we take our HIV tests,
I'm gonna show you.

50
00:02:42,946 --> 00:02:45,676
COOPER: Oh, show me now.
- I can't. I have a job interview.

51
00:02:46,015 --> 00:02:48,415
Which, if it goes well, we can celebrate.

52
00:02:50,186 --> 00:02:51,312
In the cornfield.

53
00:02:51,454 --> 00:02:53,251
COOPER:
Job interview?

54
00:02:55,558 --> 00:02:57,992
SAM:
I forgot how much fun irresponsibility is.

55
00:02:58,127 --> 00:03:01,096
NAOMl:
Oh, really? I love irresponsibility.

56
00:03:01,531 --> 00:03:03,021
Mom?

57
00:03:03,633 --> 00:03:04,930
Dad?

58
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:07,362
Are you getting back together?

59
00:03:08,805 --> 00:03:11,672
- Yeah.
- Absolutely. Yes.

60
00:03:11,808 --> 00:03:13,366
Yeah.

61
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:17,541
You should have seen
Maya's face, man.

62
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,207
It was like Christmas, new puppy,
first car, all rolled into one.

63
00:03:21,351 --> 00:03:22,784
What was I supposed to say?

64
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:25,012
Are you and Naomi ready
to get back together?

65
00:03:25,154 --> 00:03:28,612
I mean, I just got single.
I haven't sown any oats.

66
00:03:28,758 --> 00:03:31,283
I can't get over the feeling
that I'm missing something.

67
00:03:31,427 --> 00:03:33,827
- Like?
- Like an ex-lover jetting in

68
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,487
and making me look like this one.

69
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:39,598
No. Love, companionship. That is not
a step backwards. That's a step forwards.

70
00:03:39,736 --> 00:03:42,534
It's like taking off the condom.
And taking off the condom is good.

71
00:03:45,008 --> 00:03:46,737
Metaphorically.

72
00:03:47,443 --> 00:03:50,571
So you can do that? Let go of the betrayal,
everything he put you through?

73
00:03:50,713 --> 00:03:52,943
Yeah, well, you know,
we both played our part.

74
00:03:53,082 --> 00:03:56,848
But I don't know.
Now it just feels right.

75
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,681
We're Sam and Naomi.

76
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:01,221
- Sam and Naomi, together again.
NAOMl: Yeah.

77
00:04:01,357 --> 00:04:05,487
You and Sam?
You're getting back together? Nai, that's...

78
00:04:05,628 --> 00:04:08,096
That's great. That's amazing.

79
00:04:08,231 --> 00:04:09,823
Thank you.

80
00:04:11,734 --> 00:04:16,364
So I hear the mean, new boss lady
is calling a morning meeting.

81
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,701
Oh, now, she's not that bad.

82
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:20,904
Once you get to know her.

83
00:04:23,713 --> 00:04:26,705
Four hundred
and eighty-seven thousand dollars.

84
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,578
- What does that mean?
- How much we need

85
00:04:28,718 --> 00:04:30,618
- to keep the doors open.
- And you have a plan?

86
00:04:30,753 --> 00:04:34,018
A plan that doesn't change
what the practice is supposed to be.

87
00:04:34,157 --> 00:04:38,958
I do, actually. Starting Monday,
our doors will open one hour earlier,

88
00:04:39,095 --> 00:04:41,689
and we will close one hour later.

89
00:04:42,165 --> 00:04:44,360
We will also be working weekends.

90
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,434
Saturdays from 9 to 1.

91
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:47,934
I have a...

92
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:50,263
- Sure.
ADDISON: And in addition,

93
00:04:50,406 --> 00:04:54,137
I will be asking each of you
to take on extra responsibilities

94
00:04:54,277 --> 00:04:56,404
- to help generate income.
- What about me?

95
00:04:56,546 --> 00:05:00,778
You will be working with me
to find the extra money.

96
00:05:00,917 --> 00:05:02,942
Pete, we have to go.
It's Jenna's day.

97
00:05:03,086 --> 00:05:04,314
- Jenna's day.
- That's today?

98
00:05:04,454 --> 00:05:06,581
Oh, my God. It's Jenna's day.

99
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:07,815
COOPER: Jenna.
- Jenna?

100
00:05:07,957 --> 00:05:09,447
Tell her I said hi.

101
00:05:10,793 --> 00:05:12,784
Who's Jenna?

102
00:05:15,598 --> 00:05:18,863
Saved the practice. You're welcome.

103
00:05:20,336 --> 00:05:22,998
Hey, can you set up two blood-draw kits
for me for this afternoon?

104
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:25,334
- Sure.
- That's a whole lot of condoms.

105
00:05:25,475 --> 00:05:26,635
Planned Parenthood.

106
00:05:26,776 --> 00:05:29,336
Addison's helping them with community
outreach. And they're free.

107
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:31,276
VIOLET:
Go ahead, Cooper. Line your pockets.

108
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,507
- No, I'm good.
- Oh, you're good with condoms?

109
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:34,911
Yeah.

110
00:05:36,886 --> 00:05:38,581
So it's over?

111
00:05:38,721 --> 00:05:41,155
- Between you and Charlotte? I'm sorry.
- What? No.

112
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:44,657
What? Oh. Oh!

113
00:05:44,794 --> 00:05:46,785
You're being monogamous?

114
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,487
You're being serious?

115
00:05:48,631 --> 00:05:49,962
With Charlotte? Really?

116
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,623
- Charlotte?
- Yeah.

117
00:05:53,236 --> 00:05:54,464
Here's the part where you say:

118
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,697
"Congratulations, Cooper.
I'm happy for you."

119
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:00,200
Uh, I have to go.

120
00:06:00,343 --> 00:06:02,436
An old friend is in from out of town.

121
00:06:02,578 --> 00:06:05,046
A really... A really good friend.

122
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:11,110
NAOMl: Okay, Jenna.
I am aspirating the follicular fluid.

123
00:06:11,254 --> 00:06:14,223
So tell us about the wedding.
You have a white dress and a big cake?

124
00:06:14,357 --> 00:06:16,257
Yeah. Strawberry.

125
00:06:16,392 --> 00:06:19,850
Look at my wedding ring.
It's a karat. A whole karat.

126
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:21,321
It was her grandmother's.

127
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,364
Oh, please tell me
you brought pictures.

128
00:06:23,499 --> 00:06:24,989
Now, we need to see the pictures.

129
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:27,329
I have the album in the car.
I will bring it up.

130
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,370
It was the most amazing day of my life.

131
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:33,537
- Until now.
- And I am done.

132
00:06:33,676 --> 00:06:35,143
You're done? You got my eggs?

133
00:06:35,278 --> 00:06:36,802
PETE: Hey, Nick.
NICK: Hey, guys.

134
00:06:36,946 --> 00:06:38,914
NAOMl: Hey, Nick.
LYNN: Hey, sweetie.

135
00:06:40,049 --> 00:06:42,916
- I'm sorry, practice ran late.
- She got my eggs, Nick.

136
00:06:43,453 --> 00:06:46,081
Wow, it's really happening.

137
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,650
- How'd she do?
PETE: She's a trouper.

138
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:55,122
SAM:
Oh, great.

139
00:06:55,264 --> 00:06:57,061
- What's going on?
- Egg retrieval.

140
00:06:57,467 --> 00:07:00,334
Is there an office pool
on how many eggs we'll get?

141
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,802
- No. It's Jenna.
- That's Jenna?

142
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:04,964
COOPER: Yeah. We've known her
and her family a long time.

143
00:07:05,108 --> 00:07:07,941
- How old is she?
- All right. Seventeen.

144
00:07:08,077 --> 00:07:11,444
Uh... Why are we doing egg retrieval
on a 17-year-old?

145
00:07:12,115 --> 00:07:15,346
- Because she's dying.
PETE: And we're giving her last wish.

146
00:07:15,485 --> 00:07:17,043
A baby.

147
00:07:28,498 --> 00:07:30,022
Thank you.

148
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:33,363
Vi, oh, look at you.

149
00:07:35,438 --> 00:07:37,463
Look at you. Assistant DA
wasn't impressive enough,

150
00:07:37,607 --> 00:07:40,269
you had to run for Congress?
You big show-off.

151
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,771
- Oh, it's so good to see you.
- Is everything okay?

152
00:07:45,281 --> 00:07:46,908
Yeah, the campaign's going well.

153
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:52,385
I'm up in the polls, so the other side
wants to bring me down. You know?

154
00:07:53,022 --> 00:07:59,188
They're calling my law professors
and ex-boyfriends.

155
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:02,626
- No one's called you, have they?
- No.

156
00:08:02,765 --> 00:08:04,790
And even if they did,
you're safe with me.

157
00:08:04,934 --> 00:08:08,995
We've always had each other's backs,
right? Through good and bad.

158
00:08:11,641 --> 00:08:12,767
I need help, Vi.

159
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:16,276
Okay. Well, if things are tough again,
then I can recommend someone.

160
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:18,175
A therapist. Discreet.

161
00:08:18,314 --> 00:08:20,282
- Not that.
- Well, tell me. Anything.

162
00:08:22,685 --> 00:08:24,949
I need you
to destroy my medical records.

163
00:08:42,071 --> 00:08:44,335
- You remember freshman year?
- Are you kidding?

164
00:08:44,473 --> 00:08:46,634
- You know, my mother just died and you...
- Yeah.

165
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:50,501
Well, I never told you,

166
00:08:51,247 --> 00:08:53,010
but Christmas break

167
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:55,174
I admitted myself to St. Ambrose.

168
00:08:55,318 --> 00:08:56,615
I had shock therapy.

169
00:08:58,854 --> 00:09:01,755
Why didn't you tell me?
We poured our souls out to each other.

170
00:09:01,891 --> 00:09:06,191
Well, I was too embarrassed.
And I just couldn't. But now...

171
00:09:06,329 --> 00:09:07,853
You see my problem.

172
00:09:07,997 --> 00:09:09,430
Shock therapy is not a big deal.

173
00:09:09,565 --> 00:09:14,025
Oh, well, maybe not to you,
but voters won't see it that way.

174
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,694
Everyone's seen <i>Cuckoo's Nest.</i>

175
00:09:15,838 --> 00:09:18,068
- Shock therapy equals lobotomy.
- No.

176
00:09:18,207 --> 00:09:21,074
It's different now. Even the American
Psychiatric Association says...

177
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,701
The voters won't be reading
the annals of the APA.

178
00:09:23,846 --> 00:09:25,711
They're not gonna be reading
your records.

179
00:09:25,848 --> 00:09:28,874
All it takes is one reporter
flirting with a nurse at St. Ambrose.

180
00:09:29,018 --> 00:09:32,977
That's how politicians are ruined.
But, oh, if those files could disappear...

181
00:09:33,122 --> 00:09:36,216
That's how doctors are ruined.
I could lose my license.

182
00:09:36,359 --> 00:09:38,520
Violet, you know I wouldn't ask if...

183
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,856
Please, I would do anything for you.

184
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,259
I just...

185
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:46,996
I need you to do this one thing for me.

186
00:09:49,739 --> 00:09:53,436
- You're implanting a baby in a baby?
- Jenna is a married woman.

187
00:09:53,576 --> 00:09:56,739
She's a teenager and she's dying.
How long does she have?

188
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:58,369
- A year or two.
- And what then?

189
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:01,415
Addison, you don't know this girl
or this family. We do.

190
00:10:02,151 --> 00:10:03,675
Jenna was one of my first patients.

191
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:06,117
The cutest kid.
Every appointment, she'd bring a doll.

192
00:10:06,255 --> 00:10:08,280
Whatever boo-boo she had,
she'd put it on this doll.

193
00:10:08,424 --> 00:10:10,688
- She wanted to mother it.
- She doesn't need a living doll.

194
00:10:10,826 --> 00:10:14,626
She needs to be living what life
she has left. Making the most of it.

195
00:10:14,764 --> 00:10:18,029
Well, for her and her family,
"the most of it" is having a child.

196
00:10:18,167 --> 00:10:21,364
NAOMl: Violet has seen Jenna's parents
through this entire process.

197
00:10:21,504 --> 00:10:24,735
And they went from watching
their only child die to hope.

198
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,775
Aren't we, in effect, creating an orphan?

199
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,310
Jenna has parents and a husband
who loves her.

200
00:10:30,446 --> 00:10:32,607
Maybe it's young love, but it's real.

201
00:10:32,748 --> 00:10:34,409
Is she even strong enough
to carry a baby?

202
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,711
Do you think that we'd be doing this
if she wasn't?

203
00:10:36,852 --> 00:10:38,376
I think that you all love this girl.

204
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:40,989
I'm just not sure
that you're doing the right thing.

205
00:10:41,123 --> 00:10:42,681
This what it's like with you in charge?

206
00:10:42,825 --> 00:10:44,759
Questioning decisions
we've already made?

207
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,419
Because we all talked about this case
last year

208
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:50,157
and we decided that if she could get
through chemo,

209
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:52,426
and if she were strong enough...

210
00:10:53,636 --> 00:10:55,797
Wait, there's a healthy egg.
I'm gonna grab some more.

211
00:10:55,938 --> 00:10:58,236
I'm gonna get Nick in the donation room.

212
00:10:59,608 --> 00:11:02,907
All right, in 24 hours,
she could be pregnant.

213
00:11:04,647 --> 00:11:07,616
Addison. Hey, Addison.

214
00:11:07,783 --> 00:11:09,341
Naomi was making a dig at me.

215
00:11:09,485 --> 00:11:12,682
What, just because I haven't been here
as long as the rest of you...?

216
00:11:12,822 --> 00:11:14,449
Naomi is just being protective of Jenna.

217
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,921
We all are.

218
00:11:16,058 --> 00:11:19,027
Look, maybe
from the outside it seems crazy.

219
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:22,587
But what we have been through
with this girl, non-Hodgkins lymphoma,

220
00:11:22,732 --> 00:11:24,597
Sam and Cooper got her
the best oncologist.

221
00:11:24,734 --> 00:11:26,599
She did radiation,
chemo, bone marrow.

222
00:11:26,736 --> 00:11:30,035
I threw the kitchen sink
of alternative treatments at her.

223
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,073
She's dying.

224
00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:36,508
But she is holding on for this.

225
00:11:37,646 --> 00:11:39,443
- Naomi was not making a dig.
- Felt like it.

226
00:11:39,582 --> 00:11:41,482
She's trying.

227
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:46,414
Just leave the Jenna thing alone.

228
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,953
Do you have any idea how much money
we're owed in overdue accounts?

229
00:11:52,094 --> 00:11:54,892
- How much?
- Hundred and forty-two thousand dollars.

230
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:56,764
That is great.

231
00:11:56,899 --> 00:11:59,129
That is real money.

232
00:11:59,268 --> 00:12:01,065
You want me to get
a collection agency on it?

233
00:12:01,203 --> 00:12:04,695
What, and give them a huge cut?
No. You have the ledger. You call them.

234
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,809
I need an enforcer, Dell.

235
00:12:07,943 --> 00:12:10,741
Someone to call the patients,
motivate them to pay up.

236
00:12:11,614 --> 00:12:12,672
An enforcer?

237
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,476
Enforcer.

238
00:12:18,254 --> 00:12:20,552
- Are you busy?
- Actually, I'm waiting for somebody but...

239
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:22,884
So my friend asked me
to do something terrible.

240
00:12:23,025 --> 00:12:26,017
And I don't know if I should do it.
Well, in fact, I know I shouldn't do it.

241
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,528
- But it's a friend.
- Wait, by "friend," do you mean "guy'?

242
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:31,428
And by "something terrible,"
do you mean "something anal"?

243
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:35,196
Cooper. It's Kara Wei. She asked me
to destroy her medical records.

244
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:36,395
Kara Wei? The Kara Wei?

245
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:38,598
That's your friend
you went to see this morning?

246
00:12:38,741 --> 00:12:39,799
Yeah. It's from college.

247
00:12:39,942 --> 00:12:42,001
- She's my best friend.
- I'm your best friend.

248
00:12:42,144 --> 00:12:44,339
She's not your friend
if she wants you to destroy records.

249
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,175
Was a time when we would've
done anything.

250
00:12:46,315 --> 00:12:48,647
You know, I went through
some very bad times

251
00:12:48,784 --> 00:12:49,842
and she was there for me.

252
00:12:49,985 --> 00:12:53,079
- So you should put your career at risk?
- I owe her.

253
00:12:53,222 --> 00:12:55,122
- She's not your best friend. I am.
- You were.

254
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,616
My having Charlotte
doesn't mean that you don't have me.

255
00:12:59,094 --> 00:13:00,527
And you cannot do this.

256
00:13:00,663 --> 00:13:02,358
You have to tell her
what you've told me.

257
00:13:02,498 --> 00:13:03,692
"Stop sleeping with skanks"?

258
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,562
CHARLOTTE: I'll let that pass.
- Oh, I didn't mean...

259
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:09,137
- I've got a half an hour. Let's do this.
- We'll talk later.

00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,736
Yeah.

Right.

- Look at your calendar.
- Okay.

- Hey.

00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:23,408
You know, about this morning,
we should probably talk.

We should. Absolutely.

- Hey.

- I could have a July baby.
- That's a good month.

269
00:13:38,534 --> 00:13:40,365
- You have a daughter, right?
- Maya.

270
00:13:40,503 --> 00:13:42,130
She's a few years younger than you.

271
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:46,071
- It's the best thing, huh? Being a parent?
- Yeah, it is.

272
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:49,507
It feels like the only thing I've ever wanted.
To be a mom.

273
00:13:50,946 --> 00:13:52,641
You are so ahead of the game.

274

To know what you want, so clearly,
and then go for it.

275
00:13:55,818 --> 00:13:59,777
Most people, they put it off
or make excuses.

276
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,914
Maybe you don't get the perspective
of how good,

00:14:03,058 --> 00:14:04,958
how precious life is until it's too late.

278

Yeah.

- No, no. It's fine.

over wild parties.

Wait, what would be on your list
of things to do before you die, Coop?

335
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,518
Am I dying?
Did you get my test results from Dell?

336
00:17:25,661 --> 00:17:28,289
- No, l...
JENNA: Nick. Please come out.

337
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,022
I really want this baby.

338
00:17:30,165 --> 00:17:31,723
NICK:
We've barely had sex.

339
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,527
- Babies are supposed to come from sex.
JENNA: My parents can hear you.

340
00:17:35,671 --> 00:17:39,004
GARRY: It's okay, sweetie.
- Nick, I mean it. You promised.

341
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,132
This is perfectly normal.
It's fertility stress.

342
00:17:41,276 --> 00:17:43,369
- I didn't say anything.
PETE: I got the key.

343
00:17:43,512 --> 00:17:44,979
Nick, I'm coming in.

344
00:17:45,848 --> 00:17:47,543
Okay.

345
00:17:50,252 --> 00:17:53,221
What are you doing? You wanted this.

346
00:17:53,689 --> 00:17:55,054
You wanted this.

347
00:17:55,624 --> 00:17:57,091
And they wanted this.

348
00:17:57,226 --> 00:17:59,490
But like she said,

349
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,095
what about what I want?

350
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,058
Fine. Go.

351
00:18:07,903 --> 00:18:10,098
- It's okay, honey.
- No. I'll do it without him.

352
00:18:12,141 --> 00:18:16,043
I'm sorry, but we can't use his sperm
without his consent.

353
00:18:16,411 --> 00:18:18,572
That fertilized egg can't be implanted.

354
00:18:18,714 --> 00:18:20,011
That's not fair.

355
00:18:20,415 --> 00:18:22,007
I need this baby.

356
00:18:23,786 --> 00:18:25,879
Come on. Let's go sit down.

357
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:32,955
He was scared. We were talking.
He had reservations.

358
00:18:33,095 --> 00:18:35,689
No, you didn't approve of what
we were doing, so you sabotaged it.

359
00:18:35,831 --> 00:18:38,732
He needed someone to talk to.
I was being a good doctor.

360
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:41,461
Do you wanna pick up the pieces
of that girl now?

361
00:18:44,406 --> 00:18:45,532
I told you to back off.

362
00:18:49,178 --> 00:18:54,138
I could use you on my campaign.
Consultant for my health-care policy.

363
00:18:54,283 --> 00:18:57,116
Affordable coverage for everyone,
including mental health.

364
00:18:57,252 --> 00:18:59,982
I have heard your stump speech,
that is not why I asked to see you.

365
00:19:00,122 --> 00:19:02,488
Well, it may be a stump speech,
but I believe in it.

366
00:19:02,624 --> 00:19:04,285
I can make things better, Vi.

367
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,858
Which is why I don't think
you should hide from your past.

368
00:19:07,996 --> 00:19:11,227
- I'm not hiding.
- You have an opportunity here to do good.

369
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,863
To embrace what happened to you,
to go public.

370
00:19:15,003 --> 00:19:17,836
- Is that what you did?
- Well, that's different.

371
00:19:17,973 --> 00:19:21,966
Is it? This is something from my past
I want kept personal.

372
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,101
Mental illness
is nothing to be ashamed of.

373
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,146
Neither is rape.

374
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,675
But you chose to bury it.

375
00:19:28,817 --> 00:19:31,684
And I held your hand
every step of the way.

376
00:19:34,456 --> 00:19:36,014
I know.

377
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:38,821
I know you were there for me.

378
00:19:38,961 --> 00:19:43,193
But burying this is not good for you.

379
00:19:43,332 --> 00:19:44,731
Hiding a secret,

380
00:19:44,867 --> 00:19:47,427
walking around, worried about when
the other shoe is gonna drop,

381
00:19:47,569 --> 00:19:48,797
it's gonna eat you up.

382
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:52,498
And I am not talking about Kara Wei,
the Congressional candidate.

383
00:19:52,641 --> 00:19:54,131
I'm talking about Kara, my friend.

384
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,766
You can stop it now, Violet.

385
00:19:55,911 --> 00:19:58,277
When I first met you,
and your mother had just died,

386
00:19:58,413 --> 00:20:00,779
and you didn't talk about it,
and you buried it,

387
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,281
it almost did you in.

388
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:06,478
Until you opened up to me,
and then you got help.

389
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,420
And then I opened up to you,
and I learned the same lesson.

390
00:20:09,558 --> 00:20:11,355
- This is different.
- No, no, it's not.

391
00:20:12,427 --> 00:20:14,486
You are about to be
in a position of power.

392
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:18,088
Think how many people you could help
if they knew that it was okay to talk about...

393
00:20:18,233 --> 00:20:20,224
I have plenty of people I help.

394
00:20:20,369 --> 00:20:23,566
Now I'm surrounded by people
who want my help.

395
00:20:23,705 --> 00:20:26,799
I came to you
because I thought you would help me.

396
00:20:29,378 --> 00:20:31,846
I thought we did that for each other.

397
00:20:38,086 --> 00:20:40,816
- Did you get my patients' blood work?
- Not until tomorrow.

398
00:20:40,956 --> 00:20:42,321
These are rapid blood tests.

399
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,657
You know what I'd like
before I die, Sam?

400
00:20:46,795 --> 00:20:49,320
I would like a lab
that delivers test results on time.

401
00:20:49,464 --> 00:20:52,092
Wait, that wasn't the point
of my question.

402
00:20:52,234 --> 00:20:53,895
It's about life. It's about living.

403
00:20:54,036 --> 00:20:58,166
I sat there today with a girl who's dying,
who's not afraid to live. And me...

404
00:20:58,307 --> 00:20:59,968
- This is about Naomi?
- Yes.

405
00:21:00,108 --> 00:21:03,805
Shook up my whole world
because I felt I hadn't been living, all right?

406
00:21:03,946 --> 00:21:05,379
And what do I do? Nothing.

407
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,880
Now I'm talking about
getting back together with Naomi

408
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:11,383
without ever stepping off a cliff.

409
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,851
You wanna step off a cliff?

410
00:21:12,988 --> 00:21:15,252
I wanna do something big.

411
00:21:15,724 --> 00:21:17,021
What did you have in mind?

412
00:21:17,826 --> 00:21:20,556
Get ready to step off the cliff, my friend.

413
00:21:22,564 --> 00:21:24,327
Okay.

414
00:21:24,466 --> 00:21:26,195
Ah!

415
00:21:26,335 --> 00:21:28,098
Okay.

416
00:21:35,477 --> 00:21:37,775
- Yeah, that's badass, isn't it?
- Yeah, congratulations.

417
00:21:37,913 --> 00:21:41,144
You've crossed the same threshold
as every 10-year-old girl in America.

418
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,642
What's happening?

419
00:21:43,785 --> 00:21:46,948
Oh, wow.

420
00:21:47,089 --> 00:21:48,317
That's awful.

421
00:21:48,457 --> 00:21:50,015
[WOMAN CRYING OVER PHONE]

422
00:21:50,158 --> 00:21:51,250
When did he leave you?

423
00:21:52,094 --> 00:21:54,494
That's fine. You just take your time.

424
00:21:54,629 --> 00:21:56,062
Okay.

425
00:21:56,965 --> 00:22:00,196
I'm done. You know the economy's
really bad, right? People are hurting.

426
00:22:00,335 --> 00:22:02,565
I came back to be a midwife,
to do less administration.

427
00:22:02,704 --> 00:22:05,172
And when we dig out of the hole,
you will.

428
00:22:05,307 --> 00:22:07,002
Right now,
everyone's taking on extra duty.

429
00:22:07,142 --> 00:22:09,667
They're doing more medicine.
I'm a bill collector.

430
00:22:09,811 --> 00:22:11,779
We need a bill collector.

431
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:13,710
Or the rest of the money.

432
00:22:16,051 --> 00:22:17,177
What?

433
00:22:18,353 --> 00:22:19,615
You know something.

434
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,620
- Dell.
- No, I don't. I don't know anything.

435
00:22:22,024 --> 00:22:23,321
William "Dell" Parker.

436
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,626
What do you know?

437
00:22:28,163 --> 00:22:31,155
We have been killing ourselves
trying to save this practice

438
00:22:31,299 --> 00:22:34,234
and you have 10,000 square feet

439
00:22:34,369 --> 00:22:36,929
of prime office space
on the fourth floor?

440
00:22:37,072 --> 00:22:39,131
It is not as simple as it sounds.

441
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:41,333
Then make me understand, Nai.

442
00:22:41,476 --> 00:22:43,444
The practice is at stake here.

443
00:22:43,578 --> 00:22:45,978
This is the practice.
This was our first space.

444
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,547
Mine and Sam's.

445
00:22:47,682 --> 00:22:49,650
Maya learned how to walk here.

446
00:22:49,985 --> 00:22:54,445
And we had an opportunity to create
a medical sanctuary. Addison, look.

447
00:22:54,589 --> 00:22:55,851
Cardiologist.

448
00:22:55,991 --> 00:22:59,358
Surgical suites. MRI suites.
A dedicated lab.

449
00:22:59,494 --> 00:23:01,621
This was the practice
we always dreamed of.

450
00:23:01,763 --> 00:23:03,355
SAM:
The practice it still can be.

451
00:23:03,698 --> 00:23:07,634
Look, now, the only way to lease this place
is with a five- or ten-year commitment.

452
00:23:07,769 --> 00:23:10,033
And that would mean giving up
on our future.

453
00:23:10,172 --> 00:23:12,106
If we lease it, we can pay off our debt,

454
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,232
our cash flow will be way up,
it will allow us to stay afloat.

455
00:23:15,377 --> 00:23:18,676
No. This is an issue
on which we see eye to eye.

456
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,372
We're not leasing it out, Addison.

457
00:23:20,515 --> 00:23:23,848
You are holding on to something
that we cannot afford.

458
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:27,216
And once again,
you are trying to control everything.

459
00:23:27,355 --> 00:23:29,823
It's not enough that you've ruined
the wish of a dying girl?

460
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:31,084
You know what? Keep it up.

461
00:23:31,226 --> 00:23:33,251
I'm gonna stop caring
whether or not you forgive me.

462
00:23:33,395 --> 00:23:37,422
And, Sam, you knew about this place
and you kept it from me. Nice.

463
00:23:37,766 --> 00:23:39,495
Great.

464
00:23:43,705 --> 00:23:45,502
Thank you. Thanks for backing me up.

465
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,440
Well, this is our future, so...

466
00:23:50,712 --> 00:23:51,906
What the hell is in your ear?

467
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,940
Oh. It's a stud.

468
00:23:55,283 --> 00:23:57,342
You know, like Harrison Ford.
Michael Jordan.

469
00:23:57,486 --> 00:23:59,386
You like it?

470
00:23:59,654 --> 00:24:01,281
Well, maybe Maya will think it's hip.

471
00:24:01,423 --> 00:24:02,720
Yeah. Hip.

472
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:06,316
Speaking of, maybe we could come over
to dinner tonight, you know?

473
00:24:06,461 --> 00:24:08,224
And then afterwards
you and I could talk.

474
00:24:08,563 --> 00:24:10,690
- About us.
- Okay, yeah.

475
00:24:10,832 --> 00:24:11,890
- Yeah?
- Sure.

476
00:24:17,172 --> 00:24:20,437
The kid's 17 and they wanna use him
as a baby factory.

477
00:24:20,575 --> 00:24:22,873
If it was me, I'd run away too.

478
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:26,611
Why should that boy
wanna be tied down?

479
00:24:27,115 --> 00:24:29,948
Great. I'm already dealing with one girl
who's dying.

480
00:24:30,318 --> 00:24:32,411
- That's subtle.
- I just want you to be healthy.

481
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,488
I'm a smoker, Pete. Take it or leave it.

482
00:24:39,294 --> 00:24:41,057
COOPER:
The lab is fast.

483
00:24:41,196 --> 00:24:42,390
Usually.

484
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:45,125
No preacher. No cornfield.

485
00:24:45,267 --> 00:24:48,725
- I needed sex today.
- Me too.

486
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:50,761
Violet's being all passive-aggressive.

487
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:55,707
Addison's at war with Sam and Naomi
over leasing a floor of the building.

488
00:24:55,844 --> 00:24:59,109
We're doctors fighting over leases.

489
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:01,408
- That's how broke we are.
- Yeah?

490
00:25:01,783 --> 00:25:05,014
You wanna tell me
why you're looking for jobs?

491
00:25:06,521 --> 00:25:08,785
I'm not a doctor anymore.

492
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,484
I'm an administrator.
I need more. I need...

493
00:25:14,162 --> 00:25:16,323
The interview today was really interesting,
it was...

494
00:25:19,534 --> 00:25:21,092
What?

495
00:25:21,236 --> 00:25:23,067
Never mind.

496
00:25:24,472 --> 00:25:27,498
- We can still be in the cornfield.
- Come on, finish what you were saying.

497
00:25:27,642 --> 00:25:29,837
I'm your friend.
Possibly your best friend.

498
00:25:29,978 --> 00:25:31,605
And we still don't have any condoms.

499
00:25:31,746 --> 00:25:33,611
No need.

500
00:25:34,983 --> 00:25:36,507
I'm pure as the driven snow.

501
00:25:37,419 --> 00:25:40,047
I'm the "everything but" girl

502
00:25:40,188 --> 00:25:41,815
who's waiting for marriage.

503
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,016
And you

504
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,684
are the horny field hand.

505
00:25:46,828 --> 00:25:51,492
And we can only use our tongues.

506
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:59,304
So if I lease the fourth floor,
then Sam and Naomi hate me.

507
00:25:59,441 --> 00:26:01,705
But if I don't, the practice may go under.

508
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:04,340
- So you lease it, right?
- You make it sound easy.

509
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:07,778
I lead guys every day.
A leader makes tough decisions.

510
00:26:07,916 --> 00:26:11,682
Sometimes that means pissing off a friend
for the good of the group.

511
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,647
I want people to stop being pissed off.

512
00:26:14,789 --> 00:26:17,587
You need to decide who you wanna be:
A good friend or a good leader.

513
00:26:18,793 --> 00:26:21,694
You're smart. I don't like that.

514
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,627
Yes, you do.

515
00:26:23,898 --> 00:26:25,729
You want me to eat noodles
off your back?

516
00:26:26,901 --> 00:26:29,165
Yes. Please.

517
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:33,566
MAYA: Are you gonna move back in,
or will we move to the beach house?

518
00:26:33,908 --> 00:26:36,706
I love the beach.

519
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,279
SAM:
Uh... I don't know. I don't know, honey.

520
00:26:39,414 --> 00:26:41,746
Are you gonna have another wedding?

521
00:26:41,883 --> 00:26:43,680
That would be so cool.

522
00:26:43,818 --> 00:26:46,651
Well... Um...

523
00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:50,781
You know, it's... Your dad and I
have a lot to discuss.

524
00:26:50,925 --> 00:26:53,223
Oh, I know. I'm just really excited.

525
00:26:56,131 --> 00:26:57,860
Come on, eat.

526
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,537
- Where are you going?
- You don't wanna know.

527
00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:09,399
No, Violet.

528
00:27:10,779 --> 00:27:12,770
Don't do this.
If she was your friend, she...

529
00:27:12,914 --> 00:27:14,211
Last night, I stayed up alone

530
00:27:14,349 --> 00:27:17,477
and watched starving teenage girls
vying to be supermodels.

531
00:27:17,619 --> 00:27:19,484
What did you do, Coop?

532
00:27:21,189 --> 00:27:22,247
Best friend, my ass.

533
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,880
- Hey. What's happening?
- Hey, Sam.

534
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,626
NAOMl: Hello.
- Hey.

535
00:27:31,766 --> 00:27:33,631
You wanna know
how I spent the rest of my night

536
00:27:33,768 --> 00:27:35,429
after you rushed us out your door?

537
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,435
Answering questions
that you ducked all night.

538
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:38,834
- We talked.
- Yeah.

539
00:27:38,973 --> 00:27:42,136
About algebra tests and piano lessons.
We were supposed to talk about us.

540
00:27:42,277 --> 00:27:45,713
Oh, I'm sorry, Nai.
I've been trying to figure some things out.

541
00:27:45,847 --> 00:27:48,907
- And I wrote a list.
- What is this?

542
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,847
It's the things that...
Things I'm going to do.

543
00:27:50,985 --> 00:27:52,816
- Climb Mount Kilimanjaro?
- Yeah.

544
00:27:52,954 --> 00:27:54,182
With or without your inhaler?

545
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:58,317
- Don't mock my list.
- Learn to sail?

546
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:02,328
Drive through the Badlands?
What, is this a midlife crisis?

547
00:28:02,464 --> 00:28:04,329
Or is the prospect
of us getting back together

548
00:28:04,466 --> 00:28:07,196
making you wanna hop in a car
and drive as far away as possible?

549
00:28:07,335 --> 00:28:09,530
This isn't about you. This is about me.

550
00:28:09,671 --> 00:28:11,696
And what about the timing?
Is that coincidence?

551
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,139
- Because we've been apart a year, Sam.
- Dr. Bennett?

552
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,368
SAM: Yes.
NAOMl: Yeah.

553
00:28:16,511 --> 00:28:18,479
JENNA:
We have a few hours left on the eggs.

554
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:19,705
I still want this baby.

555
00:28:21,249 --> 00:28:23,274
- What about Nick?
- He never came home last night.

556
00:28:23,418 --> 00:28:27,115
LYNN: We're really worried about him.
- He's probably at the stupid arcade.

557
00:28:27,522 --> 00:28:29,149
I want this baby.

558
00:28:29,591 --> 00:28:31,149
If I can't use Nick's sperm,

559
00:28:32,093 --> 00:28:33,219
I'll use a sperm donor.

560
00:28:37,766 --> 00:28:39,700
A sperm donor
is not what we talked about.

561
00:28:39,834 --> 00:28:41,495
Yeah, but we agreed
to get her pregnant.

562
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:43,194
PETE:
We agreed to get them pregnant.

563
00:28:43,338 --> 00:28:45,033
- Well...
- A sperm donor?

564
00:28:45,673 --> 00:28:48,540
You know, Addison, she is still dying.
This doesn't change anything.

565
00:28:48,676 --> 00:28:49,870
I'd say it does for Nick.

566
00:28:50,011 --> 00:28:53,174
Or do we usually allow wives
to pick out sperm donors

567
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:55,145
when their husbands
don't even want kids?

568
00:28:55,283 --> 00:28:58,081
Look, all Naomi is trying to say
is the family wants this.

569
00:28:58,219 --> 00:28:59,914
Her husband is her family too.

570
00:29:00,054 --> 00:29:03,319
Doesn't he at least deserve to be here,
to be part of this decision?

571
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:08,361
- Can you just mind your own business?
- No, no, this is my business.

572
00:29:15,103 --> 00:29:17,128
God, I hate this.

573
00:29:17,272 --> 00:29:20,708
What, she's in charge and so she thinks
she gets to be right about everything?

574
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:23,811
I think the real problem

575
00:29:23,945 --> 00:29:25,242
is she is right about this.

576
00:29:34,155 --> 00:29:36,521
I need a file for a patient of mine:
Kara Wei.

577
00:29:36,658 --> 00:29:38,057
W-E-I.

578
00:29:39,294 --> 00:29:42,263
- You're really doing this? Stealing files?
- You followed me.

579
00:29:42,397 --> 00:29:45,389
- Friends don't let friends steal.
- Don't even go there.

580
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:48,832
Okay, don't take it off hospital grounds,
don't leave it laying around,

581
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:51,461
put it in my hands when you're done.
Hospital ID?

582
00:29:51,606 --> 00:29:53,233
Look at me
and tell me you wanna do this.

583
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:55,968
I don't have one.
But I do have privileges here.

584
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,771
Well, you can't have the file without ID.

585
00:29:57,912 --> 00:30:00,437
- And you can't do this, you can't...
- And do you have ID?

586
00:30:00,582 --> 00:30:02,106
I can vouch for her.

587
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:05,241
Dr. King, this good clerk has rules.

588
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:08,487
Dr. Freedman, I assume you have
the results of our patient's blood work?

589
00:30:08,623 --> 00:30:10,454
- No, I don't.
- Why don't we go to my office

590
00:30:10,592 --> 00:30:12,651
so we can call and find out
what's taking so long?

591
00:30:12,794 --> 00:30:13,886
My patient is anxious.

592
00:30:14,028 --> 00:30:15,962
I'm consulting with Dr. Turner
on a matter...

593
00:30:16,097 --> 00:30:17,826
- No. No, I don't need your help.
- Violet.

594
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,060
- Go.
- Come on, Dr. Freedman.

595
00:30:20,201 --> 00:30:21,293
I want answers.

596
00:30:42,056 --> 00:30:43,523
I'm not talking about this anymore.

597
00:30:43,658 --> 00:30:46,923
Jenna still wants to have a baby.
She's looking at sperm donors right now.

598
00:30:47,896 --> 00:30:49,955
If that's what she wants.

599
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:52,832
- It isn't what you want?
- None of this is what I want.

600
00:30:55,169 --> 00:30:57,262
I said I'd do this.

601
00:30:57,472 --> 00:30:59,406
I want her to be happy.

602
00:31:01,843 --> 00:31:03,640
She's dying.

603
00:31:04,212 --> 00:31:06,703
My girlfriend... My wife is dying.

604
00:31:06,848 --> 00:31:09,373
I mean, I'm just a kid. I don't know.

605
00:31:09,551 --> 00:31:10,813
She's all I have.

606
00:31:11,886 --> 00:31:13,581
I just want us to be happy.

607
00:31:13,721 --> 00:31:16,053
Not with a baby.

608
00:31:16,724 --> 00:31:18,624
Just with each other.

609
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:21,489
- With the time she has left.
- Then you gotta tell her that.

610
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:26,123
Let go of what you think she wants
to hear, and just tell her the truth.

611
00:31:41,082 --> 00:31:42,310
I told you everything.

612
00:31:42,951 --> 00:31:44,418
I poured my heart out to you.

613
00:31:44,552 --> 00:31:46,349
About everything that he

614
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:48,580
did to me. You...

615
00:31:50,191 --> 00:31:51,385
You told me nothing.

616
00:32:00,935 --> 00:32:02,368
She's dying, Nai.

617
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:05,267
- I know that.
- You can't control it, you can't stop it.

618
00:32:05,406 --> 00:32:08,170
And even if the idea of this baby
makes you forget about it,

619
00:32:08,309 --> 00:32:09,503
it's not going away.

620
00:32:09,644 --> 00:32:10,702
This is not about control.

621
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:13,780
Because if we were gonna talk
about control, we might talk about you.

622
00:32:13,915 --> 00:32:17,078
You know what, Nai? It's a two-way street.
And I wanna get past it.

623
00:32:17,218 --> 00:32:20,278
I've tried to get past this.
You need to decide.

624
00:32:20,421 --> 00:32:23,049
Are we gonna get past this or not?

625
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:26,183
You're holding on to your anger
as you're holding on to that dying girl.

626
00:32:26,327 --> 00:32:27,487
I am not holding on to her.

627
00:32:27,629 --> 00:32:29,153
This is her dream.

628
00:32:29,297 --> 00:32:31,458
Her husband doesn't wanna take
her dream away from her.

629
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:35,933
And her parents don't wanna take away
that dream, but you are her doctor.

630
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:38,630
You have to stop holding on.

631
00:32:38,773 --> 00:32:41,742
All of you do. To her, to the idea
of the baby, to the fourth floor.

632
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:44,743
This is not wrapped up together with that.
That is different.

633
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:47,871
- That is our future.
- That's one future.

634
00:32:48,016 --> 00:32:51,645
Just like Nick and Jenna and the baby
is one future.

635
00:32:51,786 --> 00:32:54,983
And now they need to find a new path.

636
00:32:55,123 --> 00:32:57,148
Some dreams

637
00:32:58,626 --> 00:33:00,958
you have to let go.

638
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:13,135
She always used a belt.

639
00:33:14,308 --> 00:33:16,139
Buckle hit my teeth once,

640
00:33:16,277 --> 00:33:17,801
knocked four out.

641
00:33:17,945 --> 00:33:20,243
I was 16. I could defend myself.

642
00:33:20,381 --> 00:33:22,315
But my brother Robbie was 9.

643
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:26,546
She put his hand on the stove

644
00:33:26,688 --> 00:33:30,954
because she said he mouthed off.
I couldn't watch her do that to him.

645
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,856
The judge said it was self-defense
and he sealed the record.

646
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:38,027
- I'm sorry this happened to you.
- That's why I was depressed.

647
00:33:38,166 --> 00:33:41,363
And that's why I needed shock therapy.

648
00:33:41,502 --> 00:33:45,097
And that's why I need you
to destroy those medical records.

649
00:33:45,239 --> 00:33:49,369
Destroying this file
won't change that it happened.

650
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:51,876
It doesn't matter how I defend it, Violet.

651
00:33:52,313 --> 00:33:53,610
The headline will read:

652
00:33:53,748 --> 00:33:55,340
"Congressional Candidate
Murdered Mom."

653
00:33:55,483 --> 00:33:57,576
- And I'll be done.
- You can't make this disappear.

654
00:33:57,719 --> 00:34:00,381
Even if the medical records go away,
there are still legal records.

655
00:34:00,521 --> 00:34:02,455
I'm a District Attorney.

656
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,182
- Those were easy.
- Kara...

657
00:34:04,325 --> 00:34:06,054
Why should I expect
the voters to understand

658
00:34:06,194 --> 00:34:07,718
when my oldest friend is judging me?

659
00:34:10,832 --> 00:34:14,233
Okay. You wanna be a politician?

660
00:34:14,368 --> 00:34:15,460
Why not be the right kind?

661
00:34:15,603 --> 00:34:17,434
The kind who makes the right choices?

662
00:34:17,572 --> 00:34:19,836
Because that's the person that I knew.

663
00:34:22,443 --> 00:34:25,241
I'm giving you a choice.

664
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,375
Between the person that you wanna be,

665
00:34:27,515 --> 00:34:30,245
and the person that you are.

666
00:34:30,384 --> 00:34:32,079
Between our friendship and...

667
00:35:10,958 --> 00:35:12,289
JENNA: Dr. Bennett?
- Yes?

668
00:35:12,426 --> 00:35:16,658
- I think we found a sperm donor we like.
LYNN: Do you know where Naomi is?

669
00:35:17,231 --> 00:35:19,859
We're ready. I found someone.

670
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:23,428
- Can we do it now?
- Jenna.

671
00:35:25,173 --> 00:35:26,834
I can't.

672
00:35:27,308 --> 00:35:29,970
- What?
- I know this is what you want.

673
00:35:30,111 --> 00:35:31,373
You can't say no.

674
00:35:31,512 --> 00:35:33,412
That's the problem. I couldn't.

675
00:35:34,582 --> 00:35:38,109
No one could.
Because everyone in this room loves you

676
00:35:38,252 --> 00:35:39,981
and wants to give you everything.

677
00:35:40,121 --> 00:35:43,215
I don't want everything.
I just want this baby.

678
00:35:43,357 --> 00:35:44,949
And you know what I want?

679
00:35:45,126 --> 00:35:46,753
What everyone in this room wants.

680
00:35:47,929 --> 00:35:52,161
We want you not to be dying.

681
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,734
But you are.

682
00:35:55,703 --> 00:35:59,036
When we talk about the baby,
we get to forget.

683
00:35:59,173 --> 00:36:02,438
And we get to take back control
of this big ugly thing.

684
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,777
Having a baby isn't gonna change
what's happening.

685
00:36:07,448 --> 00:36:09,348
And the more you hold on to that,

686
00:36:09,483 --> 00:36:13,749
the less you're gonna be able
to really live the life you have left

687
00:36:13,888 --> 00:36:15,947
with the people who love you.

688
00:36:17,725 --> 00:36:19,659
I don't want a baby.

689
00:36:20,561 --> 00:36:21,755
But I do want you.

690
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,632
I don't wanna die.

691
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:42,840
SAM:
Ow!

692
00:36:42,984 --> 00:36:46,886
What? You should have swabbed it
with alcohol.

693
00:36:48,356 --> 00:36:51,086
I don't know what I was thinking.

694
00:36:53,561 --> 00:36:56,928
I guess you just get to a point
where you start to wonder.

695
00:36:57,431 --> 00:37:00,423
Wonder about all the things
you haven't done.

696
00:37:01,002 --> 00:37:03,197
But the truth is

697
00:37:03,671 --> 00:37:05,400
I like what I've done.

698
00:37:05,539 --> 00:37:08,303
You know, the practice, Maya,

699
00:37:08,442 --> 00:37:09,875
you.

700
00:37:10,912 --> 00:37:14,075
I wanna spend my life
with the people I love the most.

701
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:17,743
Let's do this, Nai.

702
00:37:17,885 --> 00:37:19,853
Let's move back in.

703
00:37:22,089 --> 00:37:23,613
What?

704
00:37:25,793 --> 00:37:28,853
If you had asked me that yesterday,

705
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:31,590
or the day before,

706
00:37:31,732 --> 00:37:34,030
or the day before,

707
00:37:34,635 --> 00:37:37,263
that would have been exactly
what I wanted.

708
00:37:38,572 --> 00:37:39,937
We don't know anything else, Sam.

709
00:37:40,942 --> 00:37:46,710
I'm afraid that we keep falling back
together not because it's right,

710
00:37:48,983 --> 00:37:50,780
but because

711
00:37:51,919 --> 00:37:54,046
we wanna hold on to what we know.

712
00:37:55,222 --> 00:37:56,519
And if we move back in,

713
00:37:57,224 --> 00:37:59,124
it won't change the fact
that it wasn't working.

714
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,226
We never really let go, Sam.

715
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,608
We have to let go.

716
00:38:22,316 --> 00:38:23,943
Goodbye, Sam.

717
00:38:32,093 --> 00:38:34,152
Goodbye, Naomi.

718
00:38:41,335 --> 00:38:44,532
How's the future congresswoman
from California?

719
00:38:44,672 --> 00:38:46,537
She's gonna be good at her job.

720
00:38:46,674 --> 00:38:48,665
- You let her have those files?
- I messed up.

721
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,343
I messed up so bad.

722
00:38:51,979 --> 00:38:54,607
I don't even think I did it
for the right reasons. I just...

723
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,681
I just wanted a friend.

724
00:38:59,954 --> 00:39:03,117
Everyone's living and I'm just here

725
00:39:03,324 --> 00:39:04,655
alone.

726
00:39:04,792 --> 00:39:08,159
And it doesn't bother me
that you have Charlotte, I'm happy for you.

727
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,587
I am. It's just...

728
00:39:13,034 --> 00:39:14,365
Well, you have Charlotte.

729
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:19,296
This came for you. Blood-test results.
From the lab.

730
00:39:23,177 --> 00:39:26,169
Open it up.
Make sure you have the "all clear."

731
00:39:27,214 --> 00:39:29,114
Later.

732
00:39:31,419 --> 00:39:34,354
Right now,
I think my best friend needs me.

733
00:39:53,107 --> 00:39:55,735
- Look, about the fourth floor...
- You know what?

734
00:39:55,876 --> 00:39:58,071
You were right. I need to let it go.

735
00:39:59,246 --> 00:40:01,146
So go ahead and lease it.

736
00:40:01,282 --> 00:40:02,374
I already did.

737
00:40:02,516 --> 00:40:04,006
Broker found a tenant.

738
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,585
You're gonna be a good leader.

739
00:40:15,729 --> 00:40:17,287
Thank you.

740
00:40:17,431 --> 00:40:18,955
Welcome.

741
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,200
- You're leaving.
- Yeah.

742
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:31,936
They need me in Ghana.

743
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:34,547
Only one direct flight a week.

744
00:40:34,815 --> 00:40:36,749
Maybe I was too hard on you
about the smoking.

745
00:40:36,884 --> 00:40:39,182
No. It's not about the smoking.

746
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,753
This is who I am.

747
00:40:40,888 --> 00:40:43,254
I drop in, have a great time, then I go.

748
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:45,915
Along the way, I smoke.
Stop trying to domesticate me.

749
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:48,790
- I'm not trying to domesticate...
- You are. I'm not your wife.

750
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:52,060
Who died
before she could quit smoking.

751
00:40:52,566 --> 00:40:54,431
Oh.

752
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,504
Maybe I should've told you that.

753
00:41:01,775 --> 00:41:04,141
Go. Go to Ghana.

754
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,473
But come back.

755
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:10,717
I'm happier when you're here.

756
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,152
I'll think about the smoking.

757
00:41:16,257 --> 00:41:17,451
And thank you.

758
00:41:17,591 --> 00:41:19,456
For being happier when I'm here.

759
00:41:24,665 --> 00:41:27,862
COOPER [OVER PHONE]: <i>The bathtub</i>
<i>is running. The candles are lit.</i>

760
00:41:28,002 --> 00:41:30,163
<i>I've done my best to re-create the world</i>

761
00:41:30,304 --> 00:41:34,263
of two condom-less teenagers
in a <i>Footloose,</i> conservative town.

762
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:37,434
- All I'm missing is you.
- I'll be right there.

763
00:41:39,547 --> 00:41:43,210
I've got to admit. In our first interview,
I wasn't sure about you.

764
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:46,251
But when you called me
about this office space,

765
00:41:46,387 --> 00:41:48,287
I knew you were the right person
for the job.

766
00:41:49,123 --> 00:41:50,784
Thank you.

767
00:41:53,727 --> 00:41:56,719
We got your hopes up, I know.

768
00:41:56,864 --> 00:41:58,764
I'm sorry.

769
00:41:59,633 --> 00:42:02,500
I'm so, so sorry.

770
00:42:03,304 --> 00:42:05,465
It's gonna be okay.

771
00:42:05,739 --> 00:42:07,206
All right?

772
00:42:09,677 --> 00:42:11,838
We're gonna be okay.
