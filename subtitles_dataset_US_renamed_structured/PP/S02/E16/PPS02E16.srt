that's destroying the baby's blood.

- Don't be sorry. Tell me how we can fix it.

00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:39,031
Well, I mean, in ideal circumstance,
I'd do an in-utero blood transfusion,

500
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,657

That's in two weeks.

I can stay in the hospital

513

- Will he survive?

even, that have survived.

standing outside the window,

834
00:39:59,914 --> 00:40:04,214
watching my life go on without me.

835
00:40:07,421 --> 00:40:08,581
Ex-life.

836
00:40:15,463 --> 00:40:17,260
Sorry about the CT.

837
00:40:17,398 --> 00:40:18,729
About the second-guessing.

838
00:40:18,866 --> 00:40:20,299
And about Archer. He's sorry too.

839
00:40:20,434 --> 00:40:22,061
He's grateful, he just...

840
00:40:22,203 --> 00:40:24,103
- He won't admit it.
- I know.

841
00:40:25,106 --> 00:40:26,835
ADDISON: There he is.
There's the heartbeat.

842
00:40:27,208 --> 00:40:28,368
How's he doing? Is he okay?

843
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:30,534
Heart rate's regular. And he's active.

844
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:32,305
- So it worked?
- It worked.

845
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,714
[EXHALES, SOBS]

846
00:40:36,417 --> 00:40:39,147
God, thank you. Thank you.

847
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,219
- Honey?
- Hey.

848
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:43,289
Hey, Jenny, honey, you did it.

849
00:40:43,424 --> 00:40:44,721
The baby's here. You're here.

850
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:47,589
- We're okay?
- Everybody's okay.

851
00:40:47,728 --> 00:40:51,664
You got a tough little boy in there.
He's a fighter, like his mom.

852
00:40:51,799 --> 00:40:53,426
We're okay?

853
00:40:53,567 --> 00:40:55,057
Oh. Oh.

854
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:58,972
I was so scared, Robbie.
I was so scared.

855
00:40:59,106 --> 00:41:01,199
I kept thinking the tigers
would think I was...

856
00:41:01,642 --> 00:41:03,542
Baby cut...

857
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:08,337
Blue... Of making baby cut...

858
00:41:09,283 --> 00:41:10,750
- Rob?
- She's not making sense.

859
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:13,376
Why isn't she making sense?
Dr. Shepherd.
