1
00:00:03,053 --> 00:00:05,419
Your family, whatever that means.

2
00:00:05,555 --> 00:00:10,618
If you're single, if you're married,
if you have kids or if you want kids,

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,024
your family should be
the most important thing.

4
00:00:13,163 --> 00:00:16,997
And your family
is the most important thing to us.

5
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:18,929
ADDISON:
<i>What are you doing?</i>

6
00:00:19,069 --> 00:00:21,970
I'm supporting my eating disorder.
What are you doing?

7
00:00:22,372 --> 00:00:25,307
Using handbags to fill the sexual void.

8
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,771
Emotional health
is as important as physical health.

9
00:00:28,912 --> 00:00:30,709
I create a safe place to talk.

10
00:00:30,847 --> 00:00:34,806
Well, I am avoiding Sam's kisses.
I'm avoiding Dell's kisses.

11
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:36,816
I am avoiding being kissed.

12
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:40,389
- I'm gonna donate my lips to chocolate.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

13
00:00:40,523 --> 00:00:42,115
Well, the cop still hasn't called.

14
00:00:42,258 --> 00:00:44,522
Two weeks, no call.

15
00:00:44,661 --> 00:00:46,526
These lips? Dry.

16
00:00:46,663 --> 00:00:49,131
Virgin lips untouched by a man.

17
00:00:49,265 --> 00:00:50,823
[GASPS]

18
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:54,926
I am having sex with Bottega Veneta.

19
00:00:55,071 --> 00:00:59,201
I put my hands inside a woman's body
and fix what's wrong.

20
00:00:59,342 --> 00:01:01,833
But every woman's body is different.

21
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,912
Every woman's story is different.

22
00:01:04,047 --> 00:01:08,450
We get our bonus checks this week,
and I say we blow it all

23
00:01:08,585 --> 00:01:10,212
on Mnemba Island.

24
00:01:10,353 --> 00:01:13,413
It's Zanzibar, Coop. It's unsullied.

25
00:01:13,556 --> 00:01:15,183
Let's go sully it.

26
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,758
Cooper?

27
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,984
Are you listening?

28
00:01:19,129 --> 00:01:20,323
Gonna have to call you back.

29
00:01:20,463 --> 00:01:23,921
How do you know you're doing what's best
to take care of your child?

30
00:01:24,067 --> 00:01:26,865
Who's gonna help you
if the baby won't eat,

31
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:29,437
isn't gaining enough weight,
has a fever?

32
00:01:29,572 --> 00:01:30,630
That's my job.

33
00:01:30,774 --> 00:01:32,901
Come here to me, now.

34
00:01:35,645 --> 00:01:38,170
I use Eastern medicine
to prevent illness.

35
00:01:38,314 --> 00:01:40,805
I solve problems before they start.

36
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,441
PETE: So I waited outside
Addison's house for, like, two hours.

37
00:01:43,586 --> 00:01:44,883
She didn't show up.

38
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:47,512
I don't wait outside women's houses.
She should be waiting.

39
00:01:47,657 --> 00:01:50,455
- Does she even know you're interested?
- She'll know. I'm on it.

40
00:01:50,593 --> 00:01:53,221
- She has you on a string.
- Yeah? You get anywhere with Naomi?

41
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,354
Hey, that's not the point.

42
00:01:55,498 --> 00:01:57,659
Okay, I'm not on a string.

43
00:01:57,801 --> 00:02:00,702
I'm in charge. I'm in control.

44
00:02:00,837 --> 00:02:02,566
I got this.

45
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:05,071
Yeah, how do you have this?

46
00:02:05,742 --> 00:02:06,970
I don't know yet.

47
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,544
A doctor's office should be a sanctuary.

48
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,647
The care you receive
should be personal.

49
00:02:11,781 --> 00:02:12,873
It's good.

50
00:02:13,016 --> 00:02:15,211
Really good.
Naomi did a good job.

51
00:02:15,351 --> 00:02:17,683
It looks like it cost way more
than she said it would cost.

52
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:19,379
Is this gonna affect our bonus checks?

53
00:02:19,522 --> 00:02:21,752
- I need my bonus check.
- You're gonna get your check.

54
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,415
PETE:
We sound professional,

55
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,551
but is it just me
or is it a Gap ad for medicine?

56
00:02:25,695 --> 00:02:28,163
Yeah, we're branded.
We're a brand like a perfume.

57
00:02:28,298 --> 00:02:30,391
Symptoms, a fragrance for men.

58
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,800
- Dell, what did you think?
- You cut my line.

59
00:02:32,936 --> 00:02:34,801
I wasn't even in it.
Not one single shot of me.

60
00:02:34,938 --> 00:02:36,769
SAM: <i>Your wives.</i>
PETE: <i>Your husbands.</i>

61
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:40,273
<i>At Oceanside Wellness,</i>
<i>our family takes care of your family.</i>

62
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,970
- I really need my bonus check, Sam.
- Yeah. Sam, bonus checks.

63
00:02:43,112 --> 00:02:46,104
Everybody's getting their bonus checks.

64
00:02:47,317 --> 00:02:49,512
- She's avoiding me.
- I'll talk to her.

65
00:02:52,856 --> 00:02:54,517
Nai, the video looks good.

66
00:02:54,657 --> 00:02:58,991
Yeah, it's gonna run on the Internet,
in the lobby on the monitors,

67
00:02:59,128 --> 00:03:02,791
and I also lined up a group of dentists
who are gonna show it in their offices.

68
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,799
It cost a lot of money,
but you spend money to make money.

69
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,425
That's the goal. Make money.

70
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,863
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

71
00:03:10,506 --> 00:03:13,805
- Your files, and these.
- Thank you, Dell.

72
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,638
If you have time,
we should have a meeting.

73
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:19,043
I have wall-to-wall patients today, so...

74
00:03:20,984 --> 00:03:22,451
Okay.

75
00:03:26,055 --> 00:03:27,716
He try to kiss you again?

76
00:03:27,857 --> 00:03:29,484
Did Sam? Because I'll punch him.

77
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,651
Verbally, I mean.
I can do verbal punching for you.

78
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,193
I would do that for you.

79
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:36,355
- Nai, are you...? What's wrong?
- Nothing. I am fine.

80
00:03:36,499 --> 00:03:38,592
I've got patients.

81
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:44,272
What happened to the paper cups?

82
00:03:44,507 --> 00:03:46,407
They're not justifiable. Environmentally.

83
00:03:46,776 --> 00:03:49,643
VIOLET: Mugs. Are they justifiable?
DELL: In the dishwasher.

84
00:03:49,779 --> 00:03:51,713
VIOLET: Cooper, guess who's been
to the travel agent?

85
00:03:51,848 --> 00:03:53,406
Mnemba Island.

86
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:55,915
Zanzibar.
Don't you feel drunk just looking at it?

87
00:03:56,052 --> 00:03:58,213
I don't know if I can go away this year.

88
00:03:58,354 --> 00:04:01,551
- We go away every year.
- I have a patient. We'll talk about it later.

89
00:04:04,694 --> 00:04:06,059
- Dr. King.
- Dr. Freedman.

90
00:04:06,529 --> 00:04:08,997
I assume you're here
on important hospital business.

91
00:04:09,132 --> 00:04:11,191
- I am.
- Well, let's talk.

92
00:04:20,376 --> 00:04:21,741
COOPER:
Can I tell people about us?

93
00:04:21,878 --> 00:04:23,505
CHARLOTTE: What?
- I mean, just Violet.

94
00:04:23,646 --> 00:04:25,443
It's getting secret-y. I don't do secret-y.

95
00:04:25,581 --> 00:04:28,141
And my bonus check comes this week.

96
00:04:28,284 --> 00:04:29,751
You wanna pay me for the sex?

97
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,887
I thought we could use the money
to go away together on vacation.

98
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,415
You and me on a vacation?

99
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:38,754
COOPER:
Yeah, like a normal couple.

100
00:04:39,829 --> 00:04:41,854
I tell Violet everything.
She's like my sister.

101
00:04:41,998 --> 00:04:43,090
She's like my hot sister,

102
00:04:43,232 --> 00:04:46,929
and we use our bonus checks
to go away every year.

103
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,538
- But I think if I went away without you...
- Do not say it.

104
00:04:49,672 --> 00:04:51,367
- I might miss you.
- Cooper.

105
00:04:51,507 --> 00:04:54,340
- Yes?
- Either get back on top of me and shut up

106
00:04:54,477 --> 00:04:56,911
or keep talking
and watch me walk out that door.

107
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:10,418
- There is a lack of paper cups.
- Dell's going green.

108
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,256
- So, what are you doing with your bonus?
- Maybe buying paper cups.

109
00:05:14,864 --> 00:05:16,832
Do you wanna go out sometime?

110
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,434
- Out?
- On a date.

111
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,732
Well, that's... Uh...

112
00:05:22,872 --> 00:05:24,100
Do you think that's wise?

113
00:05:25,341 --> 00:05:26,899
- Is there someone else?
- Yes.

114
00:05:28,011 --> 00:05:31,572
No. There was a person,
an officer of the law,

115
00:05:31,714 --> 00:05:35,309
but we never connected,
so no, no, there's no one else.

116
00:05:35,952 --> 00:05:37,647
Okay, then.

117
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,816
Think about it.

118
00:05:52,135 --> 00:05:53,864
Hey, Molly Madison is on her way in.

119
00:05:54,003 --> 00:05:55,971
NAOMl: She was just here
a couple of days ago. L...

120
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,801
Nervous mommies.
I do not have time for nervous mommies.

121
00:05:59,575 --> 00:06:00,701
Hey, Addie.

122
00:06:00,843 --> 00:06:02,708
Can you see a patient for me?
She's in Room...

123
00:06:02,845 --> 00:06:05,109
- Four.
- Yeah, I have time.

124
00:06:05,248 --> 00:06:06,875
NAOMl:
Thank you.

125
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,718
- What's her story?
- She's just got the jitters.

126
00:06:09,852 --> 00:06:11,479
It'll be 10 minutes, tops.

127
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,486
So Pete asked me out. Do I go?

128
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:17,188
No, I mean, do I go
with the dry, untouched lips and all?

129
00:06:17,326 --> 00:06:18,884
I'm making human life here.

130
00:06:19,028 --> 00:06:21,428
Patient. I will see her now.

131
00:06:21,564 --> 00:06:23,930
NAOMl:
Thank you.

132
00:06:25,568 --> 00:06:26,626
Hi.

133
00:06:28,738 --> 00:06:32,731
You asked me out
and then you blew me off. Hi.

134
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,308
I didn't blow you off.

135
00:06:34,444 --> 00:06:37,072
I had training for the SWAT team.

136
00:06:38,448 --> 00:06:40,746
- I'm SWAT now.
- You show that to all the girls?

137
00:06:40,883 --> 00:06:42,009
No, just the cute ones.

138
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:44,680
But I'm here now. I'm available.

139
00:06:45,521 --> 00:06:49,048
I have a patient,
and you are just a stranger.

140
00:06:49,192 --> 00:06:50,716
Some guy I met, you know.

141
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,384
And I don't get blown off.

142
00:06:52,528 --> 00:06:54,894
I'm not the kind of woman you blow off.

143
00:06:55,031 --> 00:06:57,431
- You have your pride.
- I have my pride, yes.

144
00:06:57,567 --> 00:07:00,035
Go away. Go SWAT something.

145
00:07:02,371 --> 00:07:03,599
Molly, Eric?

146
00:07:03,739 --> 00:07:05,502
Hi, I'm Dr. Montgomery.

147
00:07:05,641 --> 00:07:07,871
- Where's Dr. Bennett?
- She has another patient.

148
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,238
We need to see Dr. Bennett.

149
00:07:09,378 --> 00:07:13,610
Well, why don't we just see
if I can find out what the problem is first?

150
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:14,909
Let's see.

151
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:16,848
Twenty-seven weeks pregnant,

152
00:07:16,986 --> 00:07:18,851
ultrasound from two days ago
looks good.

153
00:07:19,388 --> 00:07:21,447
Oh, it's a girl,

154
00:07:21,591 --> 00:07:26,051
and placenta positioning looks good,
so, what's the concern?

155
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:27,787
I need to have this baby.

156
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,124
Well, everything's on track.

157
00:07:29,732 --> 00:07:31,529
No, that's not what l... Eric.

158
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:32,998
We need to have this baby now.

159
00:07:33,136 --> 00:07:35,900
- Today, if possible.
- I'm sorry, I'm not understanding.

160
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,801
You're only six months pregnant...

161
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:41,876
You have to induce or do a C-section
so that I can have this baby.

162
00:07:42,011 --> 00:07:43,273
Today.

163
00:07:43,412 --> 00:07:45,312
It has to be born. Please, just...

164
00:07:45,448 --> 00:07:46,779
He'll die if you don't.

165
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:49,749
He is dying, damn it.

166
00:07:50,786 --> 00:07:52,651
I'm sorry. Who is dying?

167
00:07:53,022 --> 00:07:55,616
Our son, Jason. He's 7.

168
00:07:55,758 --> 00:07:57,419
He has acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

169
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,688
The baby's cord blood
is the only thing that can save him.

170
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:12,030
SAM: You're avoiding me.
- I am not avoiding you.

171
00:08:12,175 --> 00:08:15,576
I've just been busy running the practice
and raising our daughter.

172
00:08:15,711 --> 00:08:17,508
Always keeping the trains
running on time.

173
00:08:17,647 --> 00:08:19,638
Trains or no trains, we will talk.

174
00:08:25,354 --> 00:08:26,480
- Do you have a minute?
NAOMl: No.

175
00:08:26,622 --> 00:08:28,920
No, she does not.

176
00:08:32,228 --> 00:08:33,923
What?

177
00:08:34,063 --> 00:08:35,360
Molly and Eric Madison.

178
00:08:35,498 --> 00:08:38,023
You selected the embryo
that matched their dying son.

179
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:39,759
And implanted it. Selective IVF.

180
00:08:39,902 --> 00:08:42,029
You chose a genetic match

181
00:08:42,171 --> 00:08:44,969
for their dying son
and impregnated her?

182
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,473
Yes. I do not understand
what the problem is here.

183
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,204
The problem is that
she's carrying a child.

184
00:08:50,346 --> 00:08:53,247
Except to her it's not a child.
It's an organ donor to her.

185
00:08:53,382 --> 00:08:56,283
- She's growing organs for her sick son.
- Not organs.

186
00:08:56,419 --> 00:08:59,616
The umbilical-cord blood
is gonna be collected at birth, processed,

187
00:08:59,755 --> 00:09:01,484
then infused into her son
to save his life.

188
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,216
Same thing, Nai.

189
00:09:03,359 --> 00:09:07,056
Morally, ethically, it's a gray area
to grow a child's genetic match.

190
00:09:07,196 --> 00:09:08,823
This is done all the time as a backup.

191
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,364
But he is dying now,

192
00:09:10,499 --> 00:09:13,229
and she wants her daughter delivered
three months premature

193
00:09:13,369 --> 00:09:15,064
with no regard for the baby's health.

194
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:18,939
NAOMl:
Oh, God.

195
00:09:19,175 --> 00:09:20,699
I didn't...

196
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:23,374
What...?
They had a partial-match donor.

197
00:09:23,512 --> 00:09:25,002
The partial match has pneumonia.

198
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,545
Addison,

199
00:09:29,685 --> 00:09:31,243
that means...

200
00:09:31,554 --> 00:09:35,320
Their son has had his immune system
stripped in preparation for the donor.

201
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:36,755
He's in the hospital right now.

202
00:09:36,892 --> 00:09:40,328
If he doesn't receive that cord blood
within the week, he dies.

203
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,589
What did you tell them
about delivering?

204
00:09:42,732 --> 00:09:44,529
- I said no.
- Why?

205
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,396
Thank you for the update, Dr. King.

206
00:09:49,538 --> 00:09:51,096
You're welcome, Dr. Freedman.

207
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,604
Hey, I was just...

208
00:09:54,744 --> 00:09:57,508
So on Mnemba Island
there's no phones,

209
00:09:57,647 --> 00:09:59,774
there's no computer,
there's no television.

210
00:09:59,915 --> 00:10:01,815
Our bonus checks
will be put to very good use.

211
00:10:01,951 --> 00:10:04,920
- Um... I don't know. Maybe.
- We can touch monkeys, Cooper.

212
00:10:05,054 --> 00:10:07,284
- We can touch monkeys.
- You made that last part up.

213
00:10:07,423 --> 00:10:09,516
- I have patients.
- I have patients too.

214
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:12,526
And as I'm seeing them,
part of me will be conjuring images

215
00:10:12,662 --> 00:10:13,959
of touchable monkeys.

216
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,925
- Dean.
DEAN: Hey, Dr. Coop.

217
00:10:19,068 --> 00:10:20,501
- How you doing?
- Good.

218
00:10:20,636 --> 00:10:22,365
- How about you? How you been?
- Good month.

219
00:10:22,505 --> 00:10:24,336
What I like to hear.

220
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:28,934
Dell, the new patient gowns blow.
They keep ripping.

221
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:30,841
We're working out the kinks
with new vendors.

222
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,413
What's wrong with old vendors?
Where...?

223
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:33,606
Dishwasher.

224
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,742
Everything looks good.
Everything at school good?

225
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,014
Good. I have a girlfriend, Amy.

226
00:10:40,156 --> 00:10:41,987
- She's amazing.
- Good.

227
00:10:42,124 --> 00:10:43,819
- You taking it slow?
- We haven't done it,

228
00:10:44,093 --> 00:10:47,153
yet, but she's going on the pill
so we will soon.

229
00:10:47,296 --> 00:10:49,992
Believe me when I say
I will not be the first of my friends.

230
00:10:50,132 --> 00:10:55,195
No, I know, but condoms, okay?
Hey, STDs don't care about the pill.

231
00:10:55,338 --> 00:10:58,068
Condoms are your friend.
Lots of condoms.

232
00:10:58,207 --> 00:10:59,572
Or better yet, you know, wait.

233
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:01,404
If this is the girl,

234
00:11:01,544 --> 00:11:04,308
you gotta enjoy the time before
because once you're on the other side,

235
00:11:04,447 --> 00:11:06,210
you can't go back.

236
00:11:06,515 --> 00:11:09,075
Hello. You just heard,
blah, blah, blah-blah-blah.

237
00:11:09,218 --> 00:11:13,348
Dr. Freedman, I'm gonna have sex,
and I really like her.

238
00:11:13,489 --> 00:11:14,888
It's not all skanky.

239
00:11:15,024 --> 00:11:16,150
It's right.

240
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:18,658
I, like, love her and everything.

241
00:11:21,063 --> 00:11:22,257
Well,

242
00:11:22,398 --> 00:11:24,059
now I go back to my condom speech.

243
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,658
So I am your friendly neighborhood
condom pusher man.

244
00:11:28,404 --> 00:11:30,338
Condoms.

245
00:11:32,174 --> 00:11:34,608
If you can save their son
by delivering the baby, I don't...

246
00:11:34,744 --> 00:11:37,212
Six-month preemies are at risk
for brain bleeds, blindness,

247
00:11:37,346 --> 00:11:39,314
hearing loss,
not to mention respiratory distress.

248
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,014
And no one would advocate

249
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:44,347
bringing a child into the world
before she's ready, and you know it.

250
00:11:44,487 --> 00:11:48,218
Did you even consider the fact that this
little girl is arriving into a family unwanted?

251
00:11:48,357 --> 00:11:50,348
What happens when she discovers

252
00:11:50,493 --> 00:11:52,825
that the reason she was conceived
was to save her brother?

253
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:56,523
We are talking about saving this family
from suffering the death of a child.

254
00:11:56,665 --> 00:12:00,066
- You gave them hope they shouldn't have.
- I'm trying to save a child's life.

255
00:12:00,202 --> 00:12:01,999
You discuss this stuff with us.

256
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,698
When any of us come
into an ethical gray area, we all discuss it.

257
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,899
We decide as a practice what to do.

258
00:12:07,042 --> 00:12:09,772
I meant to, all right?

259
00:12:10,045 --> 00:12:13,811
- I just forgot.
- Since when do you forget anything?

260
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:18,019
If I could get one guy to do
a colonoscopy with no complaint...

261
00:12:18,421 --> 00:12:21,686
I mean, like I'm happy
about going all up in there.

262
00:12:22,758 --> 00:12:23,952
What are you looking for?

263
00:12:24,093 --> 00:12:26,721
I'm trying to leave you a note,
but I can't find a pen that works.

264
00:12:26,862 --> 00:12:29,422
- Well, what's the note?
- How I can't find a pen that works.

265
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,596
Dell's decided to go green.

266
00:12:31,734 --> 00:12:33,395
Tissue-paper gowns, no cups, no pens.

267
00:12:33,536 --> 00:12:35,561
I'm about saving the planet,
but he's killing me.

268
00:12:35,704 --> 00:12:38,730
- You want me to talk to Dell?
- We both know who Dell listens to.

269
00:12:40,309 --> 00:12:41,367
Was this Naomi's idea?

270
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,206
I have no clue what Naomi's ideas are.

271
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,540
My woman's giving me trouble.

272
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,444
Your woman's giving you trouble.

273
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:49,577
These women, Cooper.

274
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,384
What?

275
00:12:52,388 --> 00:12:54,856
Fourteen-year-old kid,
I've been treating him since he was 5.

276
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:57,356
He's found this girl, he likes her.
They're gonna have sex.

277
00:12:57,493 --> 00:12:58,687
That's hardly a shocker.

278
00:12:58,828 --> 00:13:00,523
But don't tell me
you're getting nostalgic.

279
00:13:00,663 --> 00:13:02,324
It's Dean Miller.

280
00:13:02,965 --> 00:13:05,024
- Oh, man.
- Why does that name sound familiar?

281
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:07,362
We debated whether
we should take him on as a patient.

282
00:13:07,503 --> 00:13:08,800
He's the kid who...

283
00:13:08,938 --> 00:13:10,906
He's HIV-positive,
but that wasn't the debate.

284
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,736
- He doesn't know he's HIV-positive.
- His parents won't tell him.

285
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,444
And he doesn't know
he could kill that girl.

286
00:13:21,283 --> 00:13:23,717
He thinks he has a kidney condition
and he's doing quite well.

287
00:13:23,853 --> 00:13:26,583
I mean, the majority of his symptoms
are from the antiviral cocktail.

288
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,883
How do you keep something
from your kid for 14 years?

289
00:13:29,024 --> 00:13:30,491
It was before the prognosis changed.

290
00:13:30,626 --> 00:13:32,924
They didn't think he was gonna be alive
to understand.

291
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,586
So that explains the first six years.

292
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,425
I'm not allowed to tell him
about the HIV.

293
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,897
I'm not allowed to tell the parents
anything Dean tells me.

294
00:13:39,034 --> 00:13:41,594
Doctor-patient confidentiality all around.

295
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,364
Can't let them know
about the girlfriend.

296
00:13:43,506 --> 00:13:45,531
No, or that they're gonna do it.
This is a good kid.

297
00:13:45,674 --> 00:13:47,972
He would not endanger this girl
if he knew and he doesn't.

298
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:52,604
Hormones are full roar. He likes the girl,
he wants the girl, he's gotta have the girl.

299
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:55,808
- We've all been there.
- Yes, we have.

300
00:13:58,621 --> 00:13:59,679
Anyway.

301
00:13:59,822 --> 00:14:02,757
You know what? I've gotta try
to get his parents back in my office.

302
00:14:06,729 --> 00:14:08,629
MOLLY:
He loves bugs.

303
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:11,530
He sneaks ladybugs into the house
in his pocket.

304
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:15,865
He likes meatballs and French fries.

305
00:14:16,405 --> 00:14:19,431
And he's still afraid of the dark,
but he thinks he's too old to admit it,

306
00:14:19,575 --> 00:14:22,772
so I have to pretend to forget
to turn off the light at bedtime.

307
00:14:22,912 --> 00:14:24,504
And he likes to read.

308
00:14:24,647 --> 00:14:29,209
And all he wants for his eighth birthday
is to never go to a hospital again.

309
00:14:29,351 --> 00:14:31,615
He's a wonderful boy.

310
00:14:32,054 --> 00:14:35,683
I can see that,
but Mrs. Madison, I can't.

311
00:14:35,824 --> 00:14:38,452
In good conscience,
I can't deliver your baby early,

312
00:14:38,594 --> 00:14:41,392
- because I'm sure she's wonderful too.
- We are good people.

313
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:44,499
And we didn't go into this lightly,
having this baby.

314
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:45,861
And we will love her, we will.

315
00:14:46,001 --> 00:14:51,701
It's just we don't know her yet,
and I know Jason.

316
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,400
I've held Jason. I've smelled his skin.

317
00:14:54,543 --> 00:14:55,976
I know Jason.

318
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,574
I'm so sorry.

319
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,247
MOLLY:
I've checked you out.

320
00:15:00,382 --> 00:15:01,440
You're a specialist.

321
00:15:01,584 --> 00:15:04,849
If anyone can deliver
a premature baby safely, it's you.

322
00:15:11,093 --> 00:15:12,560
There's nothing I can do.

323
00:15:12,695 --> 00:15:14,492
How can you look at my 7-year-old son

324
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,565
and know he's going to be dead
in a week and do nothing?

325
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,463
Please.

326
00:15:28,077 --> 00:15:29,567
- Addison.
- Don't talk to me.

327
00:15:29,712 --> 00:15:31,077
Don't say anything. Please don't.

328
00:15:31,213 --> 00:15:33,238
Addison,
I was not trying to manipulate you.

329
00:15:33,382 --> 00:15:36,681
I just thought if you saw him, maybe
you would realize that you can help them.

330
00:15:36,819 --> 00:15:38,218
I can't help them.

331
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:41,255
You gave them hope they shouldn't have
and now I am the bad guy.

332
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,880
VIOLET:
Addison.

333
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,558
I told you not to say anything to me.

334
00:15:50,099 --> 00:15:52,590
- Hey, I really do need to talk to you.
- Not now, Dell.

335
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,433
Are you okay?

336
00:16:00,576 --> 00:16:02,373
SAM: What's going on?
PETE: Has there been bloodshed?

337
00:16:02,511 --> 00:16:05,207
Because Naomi's in the kitchen
inhaling the candy supply.

338
00:16:05,347 --> 00:16:06,939
Come on, it was low to begin with.

339
00:16:07,082 --> 00:16:09,607
- Dell refuses to buy any new candy.
- He's withholding candy?

340
00:16:09,752 --> 00:16:12,243
He told me to make do
with the SweeTarts from last Halloween.

341
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,253
Well, nobody can handle
old SweeTarts.

342
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,823
- We need chocolate.
- I told him...

343
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,927
This has nothing to do
with candy.

344
00:16:20,763 --> 00:16:23,163
I can't do anything.
I can't save that child.

345
00:16:23,298 --> 00:16:26,631
I can't deliver the baby
to the best of my medical expertise.

346
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:32,602
- I cannot do anything.
- Well, don't beat yourself up.

347
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,265
It's not your mess, it's Naomi's.

348
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,436
Wait, you mean the Madisons? Because
Naomi did what she thought was right.

349
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,774
You do what you need to do
to save your family.

350
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:42,008
She had no way of knowing the donor
would back out.

351
00:16:42,151 --> 00:16:44,483
But we always discuss these things
as a group.

352
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,918
Naomi went ahead and did this
without talking to anybody.

353
00:16:47,056 --> 00:16:49,957
Maybe she's off her game. She's seeing
a record number of patients a day.

354
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,617
- She's been really on edge lately.
- Yeah, it's not like her.

355
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,922
Well, guys, I mean,
she does everything.

356
00:16:55,064 --> 00:16:57,430
We just eat the candy.

357
00:16:57,566 --> 00:16:59,193
She's hiding something.

358
00:16:59,334 --> 00:17:01,325
Has anybody even asked her
what's wrong?

359
00:17:03,172 --> 00:17:06,164
- Where are you going?
- This I can do something about.

360
00:17:08,877 --> 00:17:11,107
Who'd win in a fistfight?
Naomi or Addison?

361
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:17,614
- Not in the mood for a lecture.
- I'm not gonna lecture.

362
00:17:17,753 --> 00:17:21,052
I'm gonna block the exits until you decide
to tell me what's going on with you.

363
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:24,853
- We're gonna be here a very long time.
- Well, I can wait.

COOPER: They're not saying anything?
They're standing.

365
00:17:34,369 --> 00:17:36,337
- A test of wills.
- A battle of champions.

366

You guys are so immature.

367
00:17:37,673 --> 00:17:39,265
Oh, yeah? You mentioned a fistfight.

368
00:17:39,408 --> 00:17:41,399
That's true.

Cooper.

370
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,506
Dean's parents are here.

371
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:48,946
And everyone else.

372
00:17:49,084 --> 00:17:51,609
There's a lobby full of patients,

373
00:17:52,187 --> 00:17:54,621
in case anyone is interested
in working here

374
00:17:54,757 --> 00:17:56,122
or running this place.

375
00:17:56,258 --> 00:17:58,886
ROBIN: There's a girl Dean likes,
but sex is a long way off.

376
00:17:59,027 --> 00:18:02,190
I've had pregnant 13-year-olds
whose parents have said the same thing.

377
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:05,494
Dean needs to know his HIV status
before he starts experimenting.

378
00:18:05,634 --> 00:18:06,931
- And he will.
COOPER: What I'm saying

379
00:18:07,069 --> 00:18:08,900
is you can't afford to wait.

380
00:18:09,037 --> 00:18:11,335
MARK: You have any idea
what it's like for HIV kids?

381
00:18:11,473 --> 00:18:14,909
A kid in Chicago got shot.
Another kid, they tied him to a car bumper.

382
00:18:15,043 --> 00:18:17,637
That's before people were educated.
Nobody needs to know but Dean.

383
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,407
ROBIN:
He's not old enough to deal with this.

384
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:23,242
Not yet. You want them to be children
as long as it lasts.

385
00:18:23,385 --> 00:18:25,615
Things are so sweet,
they can still be anything.

386
00:18:25,754 --> 00:18:29,019
- As soon as that's over...
- I wish it could be longer, but it can't.

387
00:18:29,158 --> 00:18:31,058
You say people are educated,
they'll understand?

388
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,751
If it was your kid,

389
00:18:32,895 --> 00:18:34,055
you wouldn't be so sure.

390
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,460
- Could you live with yourselves...?
- Do you not hear me?

391
00:18:36,598 --> 00:18:37,724
If he gets another kid sick,

392
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,426
- what happens when he finds...?
MARK: We will do what's best for him.

393
00:18:40,569 --> 00:18:43,902
- And don't you overstep here.
- You're not leaving me much choice.

394
00:18:44,439 --> 00:18:46,907
Say one word to Dean
and I'll take your license.

395
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,907
I will sue you for everything you've got.

396
00:18:56,752 --> 00:18:59,721
Nai. Come on, you can tell me anything.

397
00:18:59,855 --> 00:19:01,982
It's not like you
to get the Madisons pregnant

398

You have a good heart.

Just talk to me.

401
00:19:12,134 --> 00:19:17,470
They paid the practice $80,000,
and I don't have a good heart.

402
00:19:17,606 --> 00:19:21,235
They had cash and we needed the money
and so I took it,

even though I did have reservations,

404
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,343
because Naomi always keeps the trains
running on time.

405
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,648
What do you mean?

406
00:19:28,784 --> 00:19:30,843
I keep the trains running on time.
That's what I do.

407
00:19:30,986 --> 00:19:33,147
I run things, I mind the details.

408
00:19:33,288 --> 00:19:36,815
I mean,
this time it just got away from me.

409
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:38,654
What got away from you?

410
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:43,128
You can't tell anybody. You cannot tell
the others. You have to promise.

411
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,358
What...? Okay, I promise.
What are you...?

412
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,593
You're talking about the practice?

413
00:19:47,736 --> 00:19:49,226
We own the building,

414
00:19:49,371 --> 00:19:53,899
and I saw a chance
to refinance the mortgage and I thought...

415
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,442
Now the balloon payment is due,

416
00:19:57,579 --> 00:20:00,275
and no one is billing enough,
and there isn't enough.

417
00:20:00,415 --> 00:20:01,780
There is never enough.

418
00:20:03,318 --> 00:20:05,786
And so I used the last of the money
to make the video.

419

- Naomi.
- We are broke, Addison.

they have been, the practice is finished.

from the burbs?

how they wanna do this.

I'm taking my chances.
I'm gonna tell Dean.

If they sue, they sue the practice.

other than yourself?

429
00:20:34,283 --> 00:20:36,683

the right thing here.

00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:39,480
He's talking about getting us sued.
There are responsibilities.

431
00:20:39,621 --> 00:20:41,213
So you think that family has the right

to hide important information
from each other?

433

Sometimes people hide things
for good reason.

00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,825

- It is when you're the one in charge.

00:36:27,301 --> 00:36:30,498
The "not in my world" part is good.

672
00:36:32,373 --> 00:36:33,601
So...

673
00:36:38,212 --> 00:36:40,180
Show me the SWAT thing again.

674
00:36:40,314 --> 00:36:42,680
[LAUGHS]

675
00:36:46,487 --> 00:36:48,614
[LAUGHS]

676
00:36:54,028 --> 00:36:55,791
I just...

677
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:58,454
I just...

678
00:37:01,435 --> 00:37:03,198
I just want...

679
00:37:05,172 --> 00:37:06,537
Can we just be us again?

680
00:37:09,443 --> 00:37:11,911
I just need something to work.

681
00:37:47,315 --> 00:37:49,044
Dell.

682
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:57,914
DEAN:
This is my girlfriend, Amy.

683
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:01,858
What you said yesterday
about answering questions?

684
00:38:01,996 --> 00:38:03,463
We have a lot.

685
00:38:04,231 --> 00:38:05,755
Why don't you all come into my office?

686
00:38:16,911 --> 00:38:18,674
MOLLY:
Thank you.

687
00:38:19,847 --> 00:38:21,610
Dr. Montgomery.

688
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:24,446
I did what I had to to save my family.

689
00:38:25,152 --> 00:38:27,643
You would do the same thing
in my situation.

690
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:47,169
I heard you kicked
liquid-ventilation ass yesterday.

691
00:38:47,308 --> 00:38:49,276
I did okay.

692
00:38:50,378 --> 00:38:52,846
- So?
- Pete, I can't.

693
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,113
Things around here are about to...

694
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,776
And I am seeing someone.

695
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:00,910
- As of last night, so...
- I got it.

696
00:39:01,055 --> 00:39:03,182
I'm sorry, Pete. L...

697
00:39:04,458 --> 00:39:06,187
Not wise.

698
00:39:15,169 --> 00:39:16,761
Hey.

699
00:39:16,904 --> 00:39:18,838
- You ready for this?
- She came over last night.

700
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:22,641
She came over last night and we...

701
00:39:24,311 --> 00:39:27,280
- I'm supposed to do this now?
- What's the alternative?

702
00:39:27,648 --> 00:39:29,616
You do what you have to do.

703
00:39:30,017 --> 00:39:32,008
You do what you have to do
to save your family.

704
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,013
Okay?

705
00:39:43,531 --> 00:39:45,522
Okay.

706
00:39:45,666 --> 00:39:47,725
Here we go.

707
00:39:51,005 --> 00:39:52,495
Hey.

708
00:39:52,673 --> 00:39:54,698
I need to see you
in the conference room.

709
00:39:54,842 --> 00:39:56,036
- I can't.
- Now.

710
00:39:57,945 --> 00:39:59,139
It won't take long.

711
00:40:03,884 --> 00:40:06,045
Thank you.

712
00:40:08,189 --> 00:40:10,885
- Bonus time.
- Amen.

713
00:40:12,226 --> 00:40:16,253
- So Mnemba?
- Yeah?

714
00:40:16,397 --> 00:40:19,093
I'm just gonna go on my own.
You know, do the single-girl thing.

715
00:40:19,233 --> 00:40:21,030
Yeah?

716
00:40:22,236 --> 00:40:23,726
Okay.

717
00:40:33,481 --> 00:40:36,279
Okay, so it's that time of the year.

718
00:40:37,451 --> 00:40:39,180
Bonuses.

719
00:40:43,991 --> 00:40:45,686
That's very funny, Sam.

720
00:40:45,826 --> 00:40:49,523
This money came
from my personal checking account.

721
00:40:49,663 --> 00:40:51,654
It's 100 dollars apiece.

722
00:40:51,799 --> 00:40:53,926
It's all I had to give.

723
00:40:54,068 --> 00:40:55,865
If you want more,

724
00:40:56,003 --> 00:40:57,402
earn it.

725
00:40:59,273 --> 00:41:00,604
The practice is broke.

726
00:41:02,076 --> 00:41:05,443
We don't bill enough,
we don't see enough patients,

727
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:08,207
and we always expect Naomi
to do everything.

728
00:41:08,649 --> 00:41:11,209
So we're broke, people.

729
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,110
You told him?

730
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:20,986
- You knew?
- Addison.

731
00:41:21,128 --> 00:41:23,096
Wait... Naomi, what happened?

732
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,255
Wait. Don't look at Naomi.
You look at me.

733
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:26,798
I don't think this is the way to...

734
00:41:26,934 --> 00:41:29,664
If there are any questions
as to how the place is going to run,

735
00:41:29,803 --> 00:41:31,600
from now on, you look at me.

736
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:36,369
As of this moment, Naomi is relieved
of her administrative duties,

737
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:39,240
and I am taking charge of the practice.

738
00:41:49,023 --> 00:41:51,048
VIOLET:
Okay, I actually don't think this is legal.

739
00:41:51,192 --> 00:41:53,592
I actually think that if you look at the...

740
00:42:08,842 --> 00:42:11,572
<i>We're a family,</i>
<i>and this practice is our home.</i>

741
00:42:11,712 --> 00:42:13,441
<i>The life we save could be your child's.</i>

742
00:42:13,581 --> 00:42:14,912
- <i>Your wife's.</i>
- <i>Your husband's.</i>

743
00:42:15,049 --> 00:42:19,645
<i>At Oceanside Wellness,</i>
<i>our family takes care of your family.</i>
