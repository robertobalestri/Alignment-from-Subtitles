You came to me.
You wanted my business.

170
00:08:35,831 --> 00:08:37,196
You told me you could fix my knee.

171
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,096
That's what I'm asking you to do,

172
00:08:39,235 --> 00:08:41,533
to be good doctors
and let me decide how to live my life.

173
00:08:41,671 --> 00:08:43,901
Isn't that the way it works?

174
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:50,707
If you wanna ply our patients
with free coffee and breakfast, that's fine.

175
00:08:50,846 --> 00:08:53,212
But selling them false hope is off-limits.

176
00:08:53,349 --> 00:08:54,816
Montgomery, nice to see you.

177
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:59,281
Leah Hudley has stage two ovarian cancer
and she wants a baby so badly

178
00:08:59,422 --> 00:09:02,016
she can't understand
the gravity of her diagnosis.

179
00:09:02,158 --> 00:09:05,355
And you've got Wyatt Lockhart
promising her her life and a baby,

180
00:09:05,494 --> 00:09:08,725
but without surgery or divine intervention,
she is going to die.

181
00:09:08,864 --> 00:09:10,729
WYATT:
Not divine intervention.

182
00:09:10,866 --> 00:09:13,528
- My intervention.
- Montgomery, Dr. Lockhart.

183
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:15,398
You know what's exciting, Monty?

184
00:09:15,538 --> 00:09:18,837
My protocol may single-handedly change
the way that we treat ovarian cancer.

185
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,967
With a drug that's never been used
on ovarian cancer? I read your protocol.

186
00:09:22,111 --> 00:09:23,339
There are serious side effects.

187
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,538
Blood clots,
heart failure, immune system...

188
00:09:25,681 --> 00:09:27,740
Each of which have occurred
in a small percentage.

189
00:09:27,883 --> 00:09:29,180
You don't know if this works.

190
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:32,310
So let's just cut out her entire
reproductive system just to be safe.

191
00:09:32,455 --> 00:09:34,013
Look, Monty, it's the patient's choice.

192
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,021
Your way, no kids.
My way, she's got a chance.

193
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:38,353
There is a proven treatment
to halt cancer completely.

194
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:41,691
- It's called surgery.
- What you think is moot, Montgomery.

195
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,924
Leah Hudley no longer wants you
as her doctor.

She didn't say you were this hot.

00:10:16,065 --> 00:10:18,533
I don't care who he is,
you have to talk him off the ledge.

205
00:10:18,668 --> 00:10:21,501

- Well, that's the athlete's mentality.

Their entire self-worth
is wrapped up in winning.

207
00:10:24,674 --> 00:10:27,734
It's why you have boxers who come out
of retirement end up with brain damage.

208

- Don't know how to ride a bike?

212
00:10:34,684 --> 00:10:36,151
That's not the point.

213
00:10:36,285 --> 00:10:37,843
The point is, he's gonna race.

214
00:10:37,987 --> 00:10:40,717
And if we don't fix his knee,
he's gonna find somebody else who will.

00:10:40,856 --> 00:10:42,346
PETE:
Yeah, at least with us, we know.

He's working downstairs now.

219
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:54,669
And he tried to poach
one of my patients.

220
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,631
Yeah, I mean, what kind of a doctor
does that? Steals patients?

Adoption.

225
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:13,479
Adoption agencies
are non-profit organizations, Dell.

226
00:11:13,622 --> 00:11:15,317
I'm not talking
about an adoption agency.

227
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:18,154
I'm talking about a fee-based service
matching up mothers

228
00:11:18,294 --> 00:11:21,354
who already wanna give their babies
up for adoption with prospective parents.

229
00:11:21,497 --> 00:11:23,658
We can help our patients
already failing at fertility,

230
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:25,926
offer them an in-house alternative
to start a family.

231
00:11:26,068 --> 00:11:28,798
Adoption isn't something you just offer
when fertility fails.

232
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,168
If they haven't given up
on wanting a biological child,

233
00:11:31,307 --> 00:11:32,672
then they should not do it.

234
00:11:32,808 --> 00:11:34,605
Which is why we have
a protocol for that.

235
00:11:34,744 --> 00:11:37,679
Violet's already licensed to screen
birth mothers and prospective parents.

236
00:11:37,813 --> 00:11:39,747
Once the child is born,
Cooper has a new patient.

237
00:11:39,882 --> 00:11:42,749
Where do we find the birth mothers?
I don't want us all out recruiting.

238
00:11:42,885 --> 00:11:45,353
We won't recruit.
All we need is one test case.

239
00:11:45,488 --> 00:11:48,116
- Where will we find this test case?
- Actually, my patient...

240
00:11:48,257 --> 00:11:51,886
My patient Judy wants to give her baby
up for adoption and has asked for help.

241
00:11:52,027 --> 00:11:54,154
You've got a couple
desperate to adopt, the Sinclairs.

242
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,958
Yes, I have screened the Sinclairs,
but I haven't met your patient.

I'll bring her in. You'll love her.

244
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,633
If we don't do this, someone else will.

I'm not sure
we can go through this again.

We've found two birth mothers
last time.

334
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,665
I'd even picked out
birth announcements.

335
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,674
They had these stupid
little turtles on them.

336
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:11,007
We spent months getting our hopes up
and we never even got to meet the baby.

337
00:17:11,146 --> 00:17:13,341
The father has already
signed off on the adoption

338
00:17:13,482 --> 00:17:15,746
and Violet has interviewed
the birth mother.

339
00:17:15,884 --> 00:17:19,012
I'm very impressed by her maturity.

340
00:17:19,154 --> 00:17:21,452

is the best thing for her baby.

00:17:36,004 --> 00:17:38,165
Um, Dell says that you're both lawyers?

347
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:41,640
- Yes, but don't hold that against us.
- Ha, ha.

a chance to talk?

with the adoption lawyer today.

00:27:23,158 --> 00:27:25,388
Like, maybe
we should have looked a little harder

503
00:27:25,527 --> 00:27:27,552
to find a better candidate
for the adoption program.

504
00:27:27,696 --> 00:27:30,927
- This is important to you.
- I just wanna prove to everyone...

505
00:27:31,499 --> 00:27:34,093
To Naomi,
that I can pull my own weight around here.

506
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:35,566
You're doing a great job, Dell.

507
00:27:35,704 --> 00:27:38,502
You were right about Judy.
She's thought a lot about this.

508
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,108
She knows what she wants.
She knows what she's doing.

509
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:43,540
What's best for the baby
is what's most important for her.

510
00:27:43,678 --> 00:27:45,373
And down the line,
even if she has regrets,

511
00:27:45,513 --> 00:27:49,279
she knows she can never take away
from this baby what she's given it.

512
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:50,679
She knows it's a sacrifice.

513
00:27:50,819 --> 00:27:52,013
She said those things?

514
00:27:52,153 --> 00:27:53,279
She did.

515
00:27:54,656 --> 00:27:57,523
Look, I know you're nervous,
but don't second-guess yourself.

516
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:59,786
She's great.

517
00:28:07,702 --> 00:28:10,830
The anti-angiogenesis agent caused
a perforation in Leah's descending colon.

518
00:28:11,373 --> 00:28:12,704
She needs surgery now.

519
00:28:12,841 --> 00:28:15,173
- What about Lockhart?
- He's not a surgeon, Addison.

520
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,039
She needs you.

521
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:24,948
- You are not allowed in my OR.
- This is my cancer case.

522
00:28:25,086 --> 00:28:26,519
If I wanna observe, I'll observe.

523
00:28:26,654 --> 00:28:28,383
Your cancer case is Leah Hudley.

524
00:28:28,523 --> 00:28:31,287
You should know the name
of your guinea pigs before you kill them.

525
00:28:31,426 --> 00:28:33,986
You're a fetal surgeon.
It's not like you don't take risks.

526
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,892
I take risks
when there are no other options.

527
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:38,498
I take risks
when it's for the good of my patients.

528
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:40,157
And Leah Hudley wanted to take a risk.

529
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:42,496
She gambled, but she gambled
so she could have children.

530
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:44,036
She is so desperate to have a child

531
00:28:44,172 --> 00:28:47,107
and you used that as a carrot
to get her to enlist in your clinical trial.

532
00:28:47,242 --> 00:28:49,710
A clinical trial that could save her.

533
00:28:54,749 --> 00:28:59,550
I'm sorry.
I just wanted to have a baby so badly.

534
00:29:01,289 --> 00:29:03,484
Please help me.

535
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:04,922
We will.

536
00:29:16,137 --> 00:29:17,365
Hang another unit of blood now.

537
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:20,406
We can't infuse as fast as she's bleeding.
You need to control it.

538
00:29:20,542 --> 00:29:23,443
I'm trying to find the source.
The bleeding is obscuring the field.

539
00:29:23,578 --> 00:29:25,546
- What are you doing?
- Making sure you don't kill her.

540
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,545
- You're scared you screwed up.
WYATT: There.

541
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:29,206
The bleeding is coming from the IMA.

542
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,681
ADDISON:
I know. I need...

543
00:29:37,392 --> 00:29:39,952
All right, almost.

545
00:29:43,765 --> 00:29:45,232
Run your finger on the uterine wall.

546
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,266
- Why?
- The tumor, I think it's gone.

547
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,269
I don't feel anything.
We'll do a tissue biopsy.

548
00:29:53,408 --> 00:29:56,275
And it'll show my protocol is working.

Ever feel
like you're in way over your head?

Have you met me?

552
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,695
I'm the king of "in over my head."

553
00:30:21,836 --> 00:30:23,929
Is it the adoption thing?

554
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:29,104
What happens
if she changes her mind?

555
00:30:31,513 --> 00:30:33,674
You know I was adopted, right?

556
00:30:33,815 --> 00:30:36,750
My birth mother, she never wanted kids.

557
00:30:36,885 --> 00:30:40,343
And then the day I was born,
she wavered.

558
00:30:40,488 --> 00:30:43,548
She held me in her arms
and she couldn't give me up.

559
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,120
What changed her mind?

560
00:30:46,828 --> 00:30:50,525
You know, as cute as I was...
And I was cute, you know?

561
00:30:50,665 --> 00:30:53,759
- She realized what was best for me.

562
00:30:57,739 --> 00:30:59,331
Sometimes you have
to let people waver

563
00:30:59,474 --> 00:31:02,671
so they can figure out
what's real and what's not.

Your parents were lucky
she made the right choice.

Hate to think where I'd be if she hadn't.

How's Ray doing?

00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:20,654
Hey, it's the last mile.
His heart's doing okay.

00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,660
He's in second place,
but he's closing the gap.

Cycling's exciting.

00:31:26,334 --> 00:31:29,394
Well, maybe you should turn over
a new leaf, learn how to ride.

00:31:29,537 --> 00:31:31,903
You really never learned?
What, were you locked in a cage?

You better stop looking at me like that.

Doctors disagree. It's not your fault.

Dr. Lockhart said the biopsy
showed the tumor is shrinking.

Yes.

- I'll take your word for it.

671
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,464
Oh, and if you call me Monty again,

672
00:37:07,608 --> 00:37:10,076
I'm going to plunge a scalpel
through your hand.

673
00:37:19,687 --> 00:37:21,279
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

674
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,987
You, uh, left me a message?

675
00:37:25,126 --> 00:37:26,787
Come in, Sheldon.

676
00:37:27,228 --> 00:37:28,718
I won't bite.

677
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,059
Ah.

678
00:37:32,867 --> 00:37:34,630
I was surprised you called.
You know, after...

679
00:37:34,769 --> 00:37:35,895
I wanna go out again.

680
00:37:37,138 --> 00:37:40,767
I'm not, um... I'm not big into potions,

681
00:37:40,908 --> 00:37:44,173
but, um, someone I know swears

682
00:37:44,312 --> 00:37:48,840
that, um... That this will do the trick.

683
00:37:48,983 --> 00:37:53,044
Violet, I'm astounded that you called,
and flattered.

684
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:55,519
But that's not gonna help.

685
00:37:56,324 --> 00:37:58,690
I'm a good shrink.
I know what the problem is.

686
00:37:58,826 --> 00:38:02,091
- I pushed too hard?
- No, no, it's not you at all.

687
00:38:02,229 --> 00:38:03,526
Or it is.

688
00:38:04,165 --> 00:38:06,292
But it's...

689
00:38:06,434 --> 00:38:07,799
Look,

690
00:38:09,737 --> 00:38:11,705
you're out of my league.

691
00:38:12,473 --> 00:38:13,531
- Sheldon.
- No, no.

692
00:38:13,674 --> 00:38:17,337
I've never been with someone
so smart or funny or beautiful before.

693
00:38:17,478 --> 00:38:18,843
I mean, you're gorgeous.

694
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:21,312
And it makes me feel inadequate,
which leads to my problem,

695
00:38:21,449 --> 00:38:23,178
which makes me feel
even more inadequate

696
00:38:23,317 --> 00:38:26,286
and leads to even more difficulty.

697
00:38:27,521 --> 00:38:32,220
And whatever's in that little bottle
is not gonna make you less beautiful.

698
00:38:36,364 --> 00:38:37,922
I like you, Violet.

699
00:38:38,499 --> 00:38:42,162
You think maybe we could be friends?

700
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:00,812
How was work?

701
00:39:00,955 --> 00:39:02,445
This is as far as I got.

702
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,955
You've been sitting here all day?

703
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:05,615
Yeah, yeah.

704
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,853
My ass fell asleep two hours ago.

705
00:39:07,995 --> 00:39:10,088
- Ha, ha.
- It's not funny.

706
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,667
Okay, maybe it's a little funny.

707
00:39:14,802 --> 00:39:16,736
- And stupid.
- Mm.

708
00:39:18,873 --> 00:39:22,365
You can say, "I told you so"
and whatever else you want.

709
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:25,070
I deserve it. I should've listened to you.

710
00:39:25,212 --> 00:39:26,839
No. Why listen to me?

711
00:39:26,981 --> 00:39:28,539
I'm not your doctor.

712
00:39:28,682 --> 00:39:30,377
No, you're my girlfriend

713
00:39:30,518 --> 00:39:33,385
who's gone way past the limit
of what anyone would do.

714
00:39:33,521 --> 00:39:38,151
And I'm not sure
that I've said thank you.

715
00:39:40,594 --> 00:39:44,257
Why do patients always
have to figure out things the hard way?

716
00:39:44,398 --> 00:39:46,195
[LAUGHS]

717
00:39:48,869 --> 00:39:50,632
Okay. Okay, I'm ready.

718
00:39:50,771 --> 00:39:52,238
Okay. Go.

719
00:39:52,373 --> 00:39:54,068
Okay, you won't let go until I say, right?

720
00:39:54,208 --> 00:39:55,937
I am holding on, Sam. Pedal, go.

721
00:39:56,077 --> 00:39:57,738
- You won't let go until I say?
- Go, Sam.

722
00:39:57,878 --> 00:39:59,368
- Go, go, go.
- Okay, here I go.

723
00:39:59,513 --> 00:40:00,741
Go on.

724
00:40:00,881 --> 00:40:03,611
- All right. Okay. Heh.
- Whoa. Whoa.

725
00:40:04,852 --> 00:40:06,149
There you go. Go, go, go.

726
00:40:06,287 --> 00:40:07,447
You got it. You got it.

727
00:40:07,588 --> 00:40:09,215
- Go, go, go.
- Hey.

728
00:40:09,356 --> 00:40:11,688
You're doing it. You're doing it.

729
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,623
[LAUGHING]

730
00:40:14,195 --> 00:40:15,628
Whoo!

731
00:40:16,564 --> 00:40:18,054
Oh, God.

732
00:40:19,533 --> 00:40:21,194
Okay. It's okay.

733
00:40:43,657 --> 00:40:46,353
I heard about what happened
at the race.

734
00:40:47,128 --> 00:40:49,323
I'm so sorry.

735
00:40:50,598 --> 00:40:52,463
Yeah, me too.

736
00:40:56,137 --> 00:41:00,403
How come you're not on your date,
using the potion?

737
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:02,637
He didn't wanna go out again.

738
00:41:05,112 --> 00:41:06,909
Oh, it's his loss.

739
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:10,744
No, it's my loss.

740
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:14,218
You know,
celibacy is a sign of strength.

741
00:41:15,289 --> 00:41:17,849
But I'm so lonely, Pete.

742
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,521
So am I.

743
00:41:21,662 --> 00:41:23,095
Like...

744
00:41:26,133 --> 00:41:28,328
Like bottom-of-my-soul lonely.

745
00:41:29,503 --> 00:41:31,130
So am I.
