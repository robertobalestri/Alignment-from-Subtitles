1
00:00:27,911 --> 00:00:32,610
So I was thinking of new ways
to generate business for the practice.

2
00:00:32,749 --> 00:00:36,708
How about billboards, right?

3
00:00:37,187 --> 00:00:38,779
What? Bad idea?

4
00:00:40,523 --> 00:00:43,321
- I don't know, Sam.
- I mean, cut expenses, right?

5
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,658
I cut expenses. Even still,
profits are only up 2 percent, so...

6
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:50,459
I mean, the consults should help,
don't you think?

7
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,727
Yeah. Yeah, they should.

8
00:00:52,869 --> 00:00:54,530
It's a lot of pressure.

9
00:00:55,438 --> 00:00:57,372
You know, making these decisions.

10
00:00:57,774 --> 00:00:59,742
A lot of pressure.

11
00:01:08,451 --> 00:01:10,715
- Hey.
- Hey.

12
00:01:13,757 --> 00:01:15,952
What are you doing here so early?

13
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,250
Running.

14
00:01:21,064 --> 00:01:23,624
You're running like
you're trying to get someplace.

15
00:01:23,767 --> 00:01:25,997
Naomi still isn't talking to me
outside of work.

16
00:01:26,136 --> 00:01:29,936
- And that makes you run?
- I'm her friend.

17
00:01:30,073 --> 00:01:33,531
Friends are supposed to talk.
So, yeah, I'm here.

18
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:35,200
Running.

19
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,609
Avoiding the office.

20
00:01:37,814 --> 00:01:41,443
- I have to force myself to go in.
- Yeah, the office has been odd.

21
00:01:41,584 --> 00:01:43,609
It's kind of like
we're going through a divorce,

22
00:01:43,753 --> 00:01:46,551
only we have to keep living together.

23
00:01:48,658 --> 00:01:51,786
- You running to get somewhere?
- No, l...

24
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:54,958
Do you think I'm old?

25
00:01:56,432 --> 00:01:58,593
Tell me you did not sleep
with that temp.

26
00:01:59,502 --> 00:02:01,231
You.

27
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,566
You slept with Jodie the temp.

28
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,435
Hey, it seemed like a good idea
at the time.

29
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:08,807
Yeah, well,
at least you're getting out there.

30
00:02:08,945 --> 00:02:11,436
- Me? Two dates seems to be my limit.
- The cop?

31
00:02:11,581 --> 00:02:14,209
He didn't call after our last date,
so I called him.

32
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,408
Left him a message,

33
00:02:16,753 --> 00:02:19,051
a horrifying, embarrassing message.

34
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:21,749
Probably scared him off. Not that I care.

35
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:25,958
Now I'm glad to not be talking to him.

36
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:30,991
You know,
at least he didn't tell you you were old.

37
00:02:33,036 --> 00:02:36,733
Although she did say that I was great.

38
00:02:39,943 --> 00:02:41,103
ADDISON:
I'm fine.

39
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,378
COOPER: Ever feel like
you're not pulling your weight?

40
00:02:46,516 --> 00:02:48,677
Everybody at work's
talking about you behind your back?

41
00:02:48,818 --> 00:02:52,379
How the hell did my perfectly arched back
make you think of that?

42
00:02:52,522 --> 00:02:53,955
Um...

43
00:02:54,324 --> 00:02:57,760
Loofa to scrub, scrub to surgery, surgery
to patients, patients to my lack thereof.

44
00:02:58,862 --> 00:03:00,159
We're drowning.

45
00:03:00,296 --> 00:03:03,356
I'm drowning. I am making us drown.

46
00:03:03,499 --> 00:03:05,967
And when the raft is sinking,
who gets thrown overboard first?

47
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,434
Oh, the pediatrician
who can't bring in the bucks.

48
00:03:08,571 --> 00:03:12,166
Stay here and drown, I'm going to work.

49
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,449
- Dell? What are you doing here?
- I work here.

50
00:03:22,585 --> 00:03:23,779
Wow.

51
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,151
Gotta pay the rent and eat and...
What are you doing here?

52
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,690
- Where's...? Where's the patient?
- I am the patient.

53
00:03:29,826 --> 00:03:33,489
- I hurt my knee. It's not... Just...
- Okay.

54
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,598
You didn't wanna get this patched up
at the office?

55
00:03:35,732 --> 00:03:37,563
You know, well, it's just silly.

56
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,998
It's just... They're very busy there.
You know, it's great.

57
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,696
It's great that you're here, you know?
Hospitals are great.

58
00:03:42,839 --> 00:03:45,808
- Used to be my happy place.
- How's...? How's everyone?

59
00:03:45,942 --> 00:03:47,136
You mean, how's Naomi?

60
00:03:47,677 --> 00:03:49,008
Misses you.

61
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:50,840
CHARLOTTE: Montgomery.
- So you're good?

62
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,141
- Yeah.
- Right. Okay.

63
00:03:53,683 --> 00:03:55,082
- Dell works here.
- Who?

64
00:03:55,218 --> 00:03:56,776
Blond, receptionist.

65
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,184
He was the talking human
who greeted you

66
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,085
when you came to the practice.
Never mind.

67
00:04:01,224 --> 00:04:03,351
Just had a surgeon called away
last minute.

68
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:04,892
Patient needs a myomectomy.

69
00:04:05,028 --> 00:04:06,325
- You interested?
- Can't.

70
00:04:06,462 --> 00:04:08,657
Got a whole fun-filled day
back at the ranch.

71
00:04:08,798 --> 00:04:09,856
Come on, Montgomery.

72
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:13,992
You love surgery. It's messy and bloody
and you get to save lives.

73
00:04:14,137 --> 00:04:16,037
Not to mention the coin.

74
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:18,265
I'll give you your own O.R. For a day.

75
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,336
No. No.

76
00:04:21,477 --> 00:04:24,708
I am off to work.

77
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,906
Fun-filled work.

78
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:32,253
- There you go. Good luck to you. Okay.
- Thank you.

79
00:04:33,556 --> 00:04:36,616
Hey. It took you 45 minutes
to write that prescription.

80
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,818
Consults are supposed to take
15 minutes max.

81
00:04:38,962 --> 00:04:42,295
- You're a stalker, Sam.
- Fifteen minutes, 180 dollars.

82
00:04:42,432 --> 00:04:44,957
Four consults an hour,
720 dollars each hour.

83
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:48,195
- Do I look like a money machine?
- You look like you could be working faster.

84
00:04:48,338 --> 00:04:51,171
I agreed to do consults,
I did not agree to do malpractice.

85
00:04:51,307 --> 00:04:54,435
And I'm not gonna write a prescription
every time someone's doctor or therapist

86
00:04:54,577 --> 00:04:56,602
says they need Prozac.
I need to do a history, and...

87
00:04:56,746 --> 00:04:59,840
Do the history, all right?
Just do it in 15 minutes.

88
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,219
Did someone shove rocks
down his pants on the playground?

89
00:05:07,357 --> 00:05:10,224
He's compensating, all this bossiness.

90
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,055
I liked him better
when you were in charge.

91
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,829
I'm sleeping with him.

92
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,496
- You're...?
- Sleeping with the enemy.

93
00:05:18,634 --> 00:05:20,898
- So let me get this straight...
- He went behind my back,

94
00:05:21,037 --> 00:05:22,800
took my job, made me feel like crap...

95
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:25,635
- And now you're sleeping with him.
- Yeah. What's wrong with me?

96
00:05:25,775 --> 00:05:28,573
What's wrong with you?

97
00:05:28,845 --> 00:05:30,506
You're a traitor.

98
00:05:30,646 --> 00:05:35,140
And you are letting him run all over you
and change everything about this place.

99
00:05:35,284 --> 00:05:38,617
He sits there and he asks me questions
about the practice.

100
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:39,813
Like, what should he do.

101
00:05:39,956 --> 00:05:42,652
As if these aren't things
I hadn't thought of when I was running it.

102
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:45,761
- He's using you as a sounding board?
- I can't stand it.

103
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:49,493
And Dell's gone and Addison...

104
00:05:49,632 --> 00:05:52,192
I have no one to talk to.

105
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,169
And I know it's wrong.
It's just that Sam has this way...

106
00:05:57,306 --> 00:05:59,365
You know what? I don't wanna know.

107
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:01,875
- No, no, no. It's that he really...
- I don't wanna hear.

108
00:06:02,011 --> 00:06:04,502
- I'm just saying that he...
- Well, don't say.

109
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,973
ADDISON [ON TELEVISION]:
<i>That's what we do.</i>

110
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:10,677
<i>We're a family,</i>
<i>and this practice is our home.</i>

111
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,378
COOPER:
<i>The life we save could be your child's.</i>

112
00:06:12,522 --> 00:06:14,046
SAM: <i>Your wife's,</i>
- <i>Your husband's.</i>

113
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:17,956
<i>At Oceanside Wellness,</i>
<i>our family takes care of your family.</i>

114
00:06:18,094 --> 00:06:21,154
- Morning.
- Sorry, not in the mood.

115
00:06:26,369 --> 00:06:27,961
Hey, Nai.

116
00:06:28,104 --> 00:06:31,972
Hey, I saw Dell today.
He's working at St. Ambrose.

117
00:06:32,108 --> 00:06:34,099
Dell's working at St. Ambrose?

118
00:06:38,848 --> 00:06:42,807
- Coop, hey, morning.
- Not now. Can't talk.

119
00:06:43,186 --> 00:06:46,280
- You're still talking to me, right?
- No time. No money, no time.

120
00:06:46,422 --> 00:06:49,357
I'm gonna go do a surgery.
Surgery brings income.

121
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,221
It is messy and bloody

122
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,658
and a whole lot more pleasant
than being around here.

123
00:06:53,796 --> 00:06:56,162
Okay, thanks. Okay.

124
00:06:58,401 --> 00:07:00,198
"Okay, thanks."

125
00:07:00,703 --> 00:07:02,068
"'Morning. How are you, Addison?"

126
00:07:02,205 --> 00:07:04,673
"I'm great. And you?"

127
00:07:05,908 --> 00:07:08,399
How are you, Mr. Scrub Cap?

128
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,578
You having a tough time?

129
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,186
I hate this time of year.

130
00:07:20,323 --> 00:07:23,622
Brushfire season,
everyone's a little on edge.

131
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,922
- Panic attacks again?
- No. No blackouts, no nightmares.

132
00:07:27,063 --> 00:07:29,361
Mostly I'm handling it good.

133
00:07:29,499 --> 00:07:32,593
I was out at that the 1500-acre burn
in Santa Cruz last month.

134
00:07:32,735 --> 00:07:35,135
Everyone made it out,
but it was a lot like...

135
00:07:35,271 --> 00:07:38,206
Malibu. Yeah, I saw the news.

136
00:07:38,407 --> 00:07:41,103
You should be proud of yourself
for making it through, though.

137
00:07:41,244 --> 00:07:43,610
Posttraumatic stress
takes some people years.

138
00:07:43,746 --> 00:07:47,147
Yeah, well, all that stuff you gave me,

139
00:07:47,283 --> 00:07:50,275
herbs, exercises, acupuncture,

140
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:54,515
it helped, but the stress
started creeping up on me.

141
00:07:54,657 --> 00:07:56,591
Every time
I saw my men go into the fire.

142
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:57,784
But you got through it.

143
00:07:58,494 --> 00:08:03,591
I did, because I found something else
to help me cope.

144
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,258
So what's the problem?

145
00:08:09,272 --> 00:08:12,298
I'm wearing bras and panties now.

146
00:08:13,543 --> 00:08:15,135
I need you to cure me.

147
00:08:21,217 --> 00:08:24,015
- Addison.
- Oh, hey, it's you.

148
00:08:24,153 --> 00:08:25,780
SWAT guy.

149
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:30,154
Yeah. Hey, hey, listen,
about that message I left.

150
00:08:30,293 --> 00:08:32,261
- Yeah, that was...
- Humiliating.

151
00:08:32,395 --> 00:08:34,226
- No, I liked it.
- Yeah.

152
00:08:34,363 --> 00:08:37,298
Oh, God, well, that explains a lot.

153
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:40,334
You torture women
to the point of them calling you

154
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:42,835
and leaving horrifying messages
because you like it.

155
00:08:42,972 --> 00:08:45,702
- You're... You're sick.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

156
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:49,004
I've been working like a dog.
I get on a case and...

157
00:08:49,145 --> 00:08:51,306
I promise to do better.

158
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,344
- I came to woo.
- Woo?

159
00:08:54,483 --> 00:08:56,781
- I got sprinkles.
- This is you, wooing?

160
00:08:56,919 --> 00:09:01,288
This is me being charmed
by your rambling and incoherent message

161
00:09:01,424 --> 00:09:04,518
- and asking you to lunch.
- Yeah. I'm off to surgery.

162
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,820
Don't write me off.

163
00:09:07,163 --> 00:09:09,028
Get to know me.

164
00:09:10,499 --> 00:09:13,832
VIOLET:
Okay. Your doctor sent over your file.

165
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,235
- You've been having trouble sleeping?
- On a good night I get four hours.

166
00:09:17,373 --> 00:09:19,238
I figured sleeping pills might help.

167
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,673
Any idea of what's preventing you
from sleeping?

168
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:25,577
Two jobs, past-due bills, a teenage son.

169
00:09:25,715 --> 00:09:27,910
Oh, a teenager.
That would do it right there, huh?

170
00:09:28,884 --> 00:09:31,682
And how long has this been going on?
The insomnia?

171
00:09:32,421 --> 00:09:35,322
Since my husband died last year.

172
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:38,018
- But lately it's worse.
- Anything changed?

173
00:09:38,728 --> 00:09:40,696
Aren't you just supposed to
write a prescription?

174
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,696
Sure.

175
00:09:48,904 --> 00:09:53,500
I think it's important to understand
what's behind the insomnia.

176
00:09:53,643 --> 00:09:55,235
To talk about it.

Yeah, I really...

- I just need to sleep.
- Linda, the medication will help,

180
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,881
but whatever's keeping you from sleeping,
it's not gonna take that away.

I'm afraid of him.

00:10:20,836 --> 00:10:22,633
Afraid of whom?

185
00:10:24,607 --> 00:10:27,633
My son. I think he's a sociopath.

186
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:31,303
He killed our dog.

00:10:39,922 --> 00:10:41,947
I just... I found it in the garage.

188
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:44,457
He was wrapped in a blanket
and I think his neck was broken.

189
00:10:44,593 --> 00:10:45,890
And it was just a little beagle.

190
00:10:46,028 --> 00:10:48,292
Why do you think
Jesse would do something like that?

191
00:10:48,431 --> 00:10:50,262
- I don't know.
- Did you ask him?

192
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,424
Yes. He just looked at me,
he gave this funny look.

193
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,433
He's the only one
who had access to the garage.

194
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,004
Is he ever violent?
Have you ever seen this before?

195
00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:00,040
No. See, that's the thing. He was so...

196
00:11:02,945 --> 00:11:08,178
When his father died, he changed.
He got cold.

197
00:11:08,317 --> 00:11:09,511
Like he...

198
00:11:09,652 --> 00:11:12,951
He doesn't react.
He doesn't laugh, he doesn't cry.

00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:17,788
He just has this cold, hard stare. And l...

You know, he's my own son,

Everyone has their own way
of responding to grief.

202
00:11:22,865 --> 00:11:24,992
It's not grief.

00:11:27,837 --> 00:11:30,032
- I just need to sleep.
- I'd like to talk to him.

204
00:11:30,172 --> 00:11:32,834
No. I really want those pills.

205
00:11:32,975 --> 00:11:36,968
Linda, you don't need the pills,
you need some help.

How did this start, Frank?

213
00:12:00,102 --> 00:12:03,128
It was just knee-highs
around the house at first.

- Is the mom lying?

She believes he did it.

318
00:17:43,879 --> 00:17:46,177
I don't know his side
because he won't talk to me.

He's got a lot of reason to be angry.

She goes on the Internet,

- she puts together the signs.
- Is he?

00:17:56,091 --> 00:17:57,649
I don't know.

323
00:17:57,926 --> 00:17:58,984
I guess I could test him.

Do you know how rare

Point is, it's getting to know each other
without all that date crap.

338
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:22,843
Mm. Tell me about this case
you've been working on.

339
00:19:22,978 --> 00:19:25,640
- The one that's kept you from calling.
- I watched two people die.

340
00:19:25,781 --> 00:19:29,080
- It kind of made for a bad week.
- Yeah.

341
00:19:29,218 --> 00:19:32,016
I've been having a run of those myself.

342
00:19:32,154 --> 00:19:35,681
Not people dying,
just people not talking to me.

343
00:19:35,824 --> 00:19:39,760
People not talking to each other.
All the people in my office

344
00:19:39,895 --> 00:19:43,558
are walking around pissed off
and nobody's talking about it.

345
00:19:44,466 --> 00:19:47,993
- It's why I'm here, cutting people open.
- Getting out your hostilities.

346
00:19:48,136 --> 00:19:54,473
Actually, you put a scalpel in my palm
and I feel centered.

347
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,341
All the other problems in the world
just fall away.

348
00:19:59,848 --> 00:20:02,840
- It's hard to explain.
- Well, you can explain it to me

349
00:20:02,985 --> 00:20:05,647
tomorrow night when I take you out.

350
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,152
- You're taking me out?
- I am.

351
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,916
- On a date?
- Yes.

352
00:20:09,057 --> 00:20:10,718
CHARLOTTE:
You're not going anywhere.

353
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:12,793
Pregnant lady with ovarian torsion.
O.R.'s ready.

354
00:20:12,928 --> 00:20:14,793
- You up for it, Montgomery?
- Yeah.

355
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:18,161
- Yeah, no, go. Cut people open.
- All right, I'll see you tomorrow night.

356
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,665
- Tomorrow night.
- Okay.

357
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:23,464
- You know, we could use you.
- Sorry. Excuse me?

358
00:20:23,605 --> 00:20:25,072
Here.

359
00:20:25,207 --> 00:20:26,265
You could be a surgeon,

360
00:20:26,408 --> 00:20:28,467
I can keep the O.R. Full
and the board happy.

361
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:29,838
It's a symbiotic relationship.

362
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:34,210
- I have a job, Charlotte.
- You're a surgeon, Addison.

363
00:20:34,683 --> 00:20:36,480
I'll think about it.

364
00:20:38,053 --> 00:20:39,543
Big.

365
00:20:39,688 --> 00:20:42,919
- How big?
- Like Mount Rushmore big.

366
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:47,957
I'm thinking, like, Paget's disease
or acromegaly or tuberous sclerosis.

367
00:20:48,263 --> 00:20:51,630
I mean, this poor kid's gonna be, like,
a bobblehead if I can't fix him.

368
00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:53,792
At least he won't be wearing a bra.

369
00:20:53,936 --> 00:20:55,563
Unless it's to give
his head more support.

370
00:20:55,704 --> 00:20:57,934
I keep telling you, it's not that unusual.

371
00:20:58,073 --> 00:21:00,405
It's a coping mechanism
and you said he's coping.

372
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:02,100
- Yeah, but...
- I got a maybe sociopath

373
00:21:02,244 --> 00:21:04,610
who maybe killed his dog
who maybe I should lock up.

374
00:21:04,746 --> 00:21:07,237
You got a bra and panties.
You wanna trade?

375
00:21:07,382 --> 00:21:09,577
- What happened with your test?
- It's inconclusive.

376
00:21:09,718 --> 00:21:12,687
Does he like to smash things? Yes.
Does he feel anger? Yes.

377
00:21:12,821 --> 00:21:14,618
The only way to know
if he's a true sociopath

378
00:21:14,756 --> 00:21:17,691
is to do a comprehensive clinical
evaluation and the kid's not talking.

379
00:21:17,826 --> 00:21:21,125
So based on this test, he doesn't meet
the criteria for me to hold him.

380
00:21:21,263 --> 00:21:25,131
He's not a clear danger to anyone,
there's not a credible threat.

381
00:21:25,934 --> 00:21:28,835
Except I still don't know
what happened to the dog.

382
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,273
Does anyone
have anything helpful to say?

383
00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:36,036
Yeah,
at least he doesn't have a big head.

384
00:21:36,178 --> 00:21:37,941
Or wear panties.

385
00:21:43,352 --> 00:21:46,617
ADDISON: Resected the cyst,
just have to detorse this ovary.

386
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,657
CHARLOTTE: Montgomery,
they need you in NICU now.

387
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:52,089
The baby you worked on before,
O2 sats are dropping.

388
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,821
ADDISON: Crap.
Okay, let me just finish ligating this vessel.

389
00:21:56,598 --> 00:21:59,658
Let me just take a look at the baby,
make sure it's okay.

390
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:03,437
Done.

391
00:22:04,373 --> 00:22:05,567
Go ahead and close her up.

392
00:22:10,178 --> 00:22:11,668
Doctor.

393
00:22:12,481 --> 00:22:13,539
Oh, she's fine.

394
00:22:13,682 --> 00:22:16,173
I untwisted the ovary, removed the cyst.
The baby's doing well.

395
00:22:16,318 --> 00:22:18,343
- They're gonna be okay.
- Is there any way I can...?

396
00:22:18,487 --> 00:22:20,182
- Not now, maybe later.
- What if I just...?

397
00:22:20,322 --> 00:22:22,756
I'm in the middle of an emergency,
but I'll come back to you.

398
00:22:22,891 --> 00:22:24,825
- How many surgeries have you done?
- Four.

399
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,860
- What about your knee?
- Can't even feel it.

400
00:22:26,995 --> 00:22:29,122
Wow, you're a badass.

401
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:31,789
What, all you thought I did
was deliver babies?

402
00:22:32,501 --> 00:22:34,093
NAOMl:
Okay.

403
00:22:37,372 --> 00:22:38,430
SAM:
Hey, Nai.

404
00:22:38,573 --> 00:22:41,098
So what's up?
I just finished going over the budget.

405
00:22:41,243 --> 00:22:43,108
I can't believe there's all this paperwork.

406
00:22:43,245 --> 00:22:46,476
I feel like I'm doing six jobs now
and none of them is seeing my patients.

407
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:49,277
You know, well,
it's tough being the boss.

408
00:22:49,418 --> 00:22:52,546
What do you think about hiring
a marketing consultant?

409
00:22:53,488 --> 00:22:54,785
If you think it'll help.

410
00:22:54,923 --> 00:22:56,982
- Right. All right, thanks.
- Okay.

411
00:22:59,728 --> 00:23:01,389
Can you believe him?

412
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:04,761
I mean, does he not think that I did the
exact same things when I was in charge?

413
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,425
Only I wasn't stupid enough
to try and do it all by myself.

414
00:23:07,569 --> 00:23:11,005
At least I had Dell to help manage,
to run things, so that I could see patients.

415
00:23:12,107 --> 00:23:15,042
I saw him today. Dell, at the hospital.

416
00:23:15,444 --> 00:23:18,242
- It was really weird...
- I have a patient.

417
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,541
I gotta go.

418
00:23:22,117 --> 00:23:23,675
So you're telling me he's normal?

419
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:26,151
One test over one hour
is not gonna answer that.

420
00:23:26,288 --> 00:23:29,189
But this does evaluate personality
and psychopathology...

421
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:30,848
What about the dog?

422
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:32,687
He won't talk to me about that right now.

423
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,762
But maybe if the two of you
came in together...

424
00:23:34,896 --> 00:23:37,763
No, I can't confront him.
You told me to bring him in here.

425
00:23:37,899 --> 00:23:39,890
You said that you could help me.

426
00:23:40,035 --> 00:23:42,595
And now he knows
that I'm scared of him, it's...

427
00:23:42,737 --> 00:23:45,865
- No, I didn't tell him.
- He's smart.

428
00:23:46,274 --> 00:23:48,242
You think he's not gonna
figure this out?

429
00:23:48,376 --> 00:23:52,335
Look, l...
He had that dog for ten years and he...

430
00:23:53,215 --> 00:23:54,648
He didn't shed a tear when it died.

431
00:23:54,783 --> 00:23:58,014
He snapped its neck
and hid it in the garage,

432
00:23:58,153 --> 00:24:01,054
and he didn't shed a tear
because he didn't care.

433
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,555
- Linda...
- I can't sleep.

434
00:24:03,992 --> 00:24:05,755
I can't sleep.

435
00:24:05,894 --> 00:24:08,328
I lie awake with a...

436
00:24:09,564 --> 00:24:11,623
With a hammer under my pillow

437
00:24:11,766 --> 00:24:14,064
because I'm afraid
of what he's gonna do to me.

438
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:17,035
And now you're telling me
that you can't help me?

439
00:24:17,172 --> 00:24:18,662
You told me you would help me.

440
00:24:18,807 --> 00:24:21,901
You should have given me those pills
because I could have buried it.

441
00:24:22,677 --> 00:24:25,043
I need you to help me. Please.

442
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,614
I'm afraid of my own son.

443
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,184
Dell.

444
00:24:40,629 --> 00:24:45,532
Um, I know you were busy before
and had to see some patients.

445
00:24:45,667 --> 00:24:50,400
- And I thought you might be getting off.
- I'm doing a double shift.

446
00:24:52,974 --> 00:24:54,532
I took you for granted.

447
00:24:54,676 --> 00:24:57,076
I didn't listen and I should have.

448
00:24:57,212 --> 00:25:00,181
You were trying to help me
and I didn't let you.

449
00:25:01,016 --> 00:25:02,984
I want you to come back.

450
00:25:03,285 --> 00:25:07,278
I have a job, Naomi.
A place where I'm respected.

451
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:11,587
The practice has been adrift, Dell.

452
00:25:11,726 --> 00:25:15,355
Since you left, I've been adrift.

453
00:25:15,497 --> 00:25:17,897
You know, I'm not talking to Addison.

454
00:25:18,066 --> 00:25:22,503
Barely talking to Sam,
and Violet doesn't wanna hear from me.

455
00:25:23,138 --> 00:25:25,766
You're not there to talk to.

456
00:25:25,907 --> 00:25:27,602
No. No, I'm here.

457
00:25:27,742 --> 00:25:30,973
Doing things I love and learning a lot
from people who aren't afraid to teach me.

458
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,080
- Dell.
- I'm working, okay?

459
00:25:34,216 --> 00:25:35,911
I work here.

460
00:25:36,218 --> 00:25:37,810
Excuse me.

461
00:25:40,855 --> 00:25:42,447
I think he's happy here, Nai.

462
00:25:42,591 --> 00:25:44,388
Seems like a lot of people
are happy here.

463
00:25:44,526 --> 00:25:47,290
- Just trying to do my part.
- That's nice.

464
00:25:47,429 --> 00:25:49,397
Thanks for doing that for me
when I was in charge.

465
00:25:49,531 --> 00:25:51,522
You never asked, Naomi.

466
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,766
That's the problem. You never asked.

467
00:26:00,008 --> 00:26:02,738
- You're in a good mood.
- Your Montgomery is a real star.

468
00:26:02,877 --> 00:26:05,175
Cash cow for me today.
She really making me look good.

469
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:07,304
I'm glad someone does.

470
00:26:07,449 --> 00:26:09,781
Stop moping. I don't like moping sex.

471
00:26:09,918 --> 00:26:11,510
I have a kid with a big head,

472
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:14,850
who as it turns out
has nothing wrong with him.

473
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,391
Except he's gonna be mocked and ridiculed
and looked down on for the rest of his life.

474
00:26:18,526 --> 00:26:21,654
- And that's your fault?
- No, that's me.

475
00:26:21,863 --> 00:26:24,855
I'm the one who doesn't fit in,
who's gonna be first out of the practice,

476
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,264
because they don't want me on their team.
I'm the big-head kid.

477
00:26:27,402 --> 00:26:30,064
Oh, my God, you're pathetic.
You are crazy and pathetic.

478
00:26:30,205 --> 00:26:32,605
A big head is not a problem,
it's a virtue, moron.

479
00:26:33,108 --> 00:26:34,598
You know who had a big head?

480
00:26:34,743 --> 00:26:39,203
Lincoln, JFK, Elvis, Einstein.
Plenty of people have big heads

481
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:41,679
and they don't sit and mope
that they have a big head.

482
00:26:41,816 --> 00:26:44,683
So don't you sit and mope
that you're a pediatrician.

483
00:26:44,819 --> 00:26:47,720
Do your job, do it well,
and screw everyone else.

484
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,849
You're the big-head kid.

485
00:26:50,992 --> 00:26:52,960
More power to you.

486
00:26:53,428 --> 00:26:56,659
Can we get our clothes off now? Hm?

487
00:26:58,133 --> 00:27:00,294
SAM: Oh, I rescheduled your consults
for tomorrow.

488
00:27:00,435 --> 00:27:01,868
No.

489
00:27:02,003 --> 00:27:04,471
- No?
- Life is not 15 minutes, Sam.

490
00:27:04,606 --> 00:27:07,074
This woman and her son
cannot be fixed in 15 minutes.

491
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:09,438
Well, I'm sure you did everything
that you could.

492
00:27:09,577 --> 00:27:11,807
Not yet.
Tomorrow, I'm going to the kid's school.

493
00:27:11,946 --> 00:27:13,846
I'm talking to his teachers
and his counselors.

494
00:27:13,982 --> 00:27:17,247
And I'm trying to get answers to the
questions he won't talk to me about today.

495
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:20,479
Cost effective? No.
But if it helps the kid...

496
00:27:20,689 --> 00:27:24,750
I'm sorry if this does not fit into
the new way of doing things.

497
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,694
- Where's the fire?
- It's no joke. A fire captain, he's in the ER.

00:27:37,505 --> 00:27:39,063
Hey, Pete.

500
00:27:39,207 --> 00:27:40,538
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

501
00:27:40,675 --> 00:27:43,200
Firefighter patient. I got paged.
What about you?

502
00:27:43,345 --> 00:27:44,676
- You've been here all day.
- Yep.

503
00:27:44,813 --> 00:27:46,440
You ever gonna
come back to the practice?

504
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:48,173
Maybe, one day.

505
00:27:48,316 --> 00:27:49,374
- See you.
- Good luck.

506
00:27:49,517 --> 00:27:52,748
Dr. Montgomery, the ovarian torsion you
fixed, her pressure's down to 80 over 40.

507
00:27:52,887 --> 00:27:55,082
- Post-op crit's 26 and dropping.
- She's bleeding out.

508
00:27:55,223 --> 00:27:56,850
- What about the baby?
- It's in distress.

509
00:27:56,991 --> 00:27:59,551
- Open the O.R.
- Extensive partial-thickness burns,

510
00:27:59,694 --> 00:28:01,753
but he won't let anybody touch him
except for you.

511
00:28:01,896 --> 00:28:03,625
He's over here.

512
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:05,626
I'm here, Frank.

513
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,463
- Couldn't let anyone see me.
- Okay.

514
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,594
Get a blood gas kit
and run a carboxyheme level.

515
00:28:10,739 --> 00:28:14,675
I need chem panel, CBC and chest x-ray
and set me up for a subclavian.

516
00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:16,777
Five-story blaze.

517
00:28:16,911 --> 00:28:19,038
Beam came down.

518
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:20,539
Everybody get out okay?

519
00:28:21,316 --> 00:28:23,648
[CHOKING]

520
00:28:24,185 --> 00:28:25,675
You're not getting air, Frank.

521
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,986
Just stay with me.

522
00:28:29,691 --> 00:28:31,318
Hang on.

523
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:33,154
Almost there.

524
00:28:41,169 --> 00:28:43,433
[GASPS]

525
00:28:49,611 --> 00:28:51,374
You're gonna be okay.

526
00:28:55,683 --> 00:28:57,048
No.

527
00:28:57,886 --> 00:28:59,717
I'm done.

528
00:29:08,696 --> 00:29:10,095
Are they okay?

529
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:14,434
Uh. Your wife had some post-op bleeding.

530
00:29:14,569 --> 00:29:16,400
But she's safe
and the baby should be fine.

531
00:29:16,538 --> 00:29:18,768
When you came out of surgery before,
you said they were fine.

532
00:29:18,907 --> 00:29:21,569
They were, but your wife started
hemorrhaging. I had to go back in.

533
00:29:21,709 --> 00:29:24,007
It's not because
you ran out to some other surgery?

534
00:29:24,145 --> 00:29:25,635
No.

535
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:28,510
- No, it's not.
- What about now?

536
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:30,618
You're saying she's fine now,
but how do I know?

537
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:34,210
Right now, your wife,
she's doing as well as she can.

538
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:36,687
She's a fighter.
She's gonna come through this.

539
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,490
What's her name?

540
00:29:39,627 --> 00:29:41,117
- Excuse me?
- My wife's name.

541
00:29:41,262 --> 00:29:45,323
I mean, you keep talking about
"she" and "her" and "your wife."

542
00:29:45,467 --> 00:29:47,094
And you're
running up and down this hall,

543
00:29:47,235 --> 00:29:49,601
and you're popping in,
and you're cutting people open.

544
00:29:49,737 --> 00:29:51,602
And you're talking about her
like you know her,

545
00:29:51,739 --> 00:29:53,798
but you haven't mentioned her name.

546
00:29:53,942 --> 00:29:55,136
I...

547
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:00,306
- I don't know her name.
- It's Heather.

548
00:30:00,648 --> 00:30:04,311
Her name's Heather. And this is
the third time she's been pregnant.

549
00:30:04,452 --> 00:30:07,046
We lost two babies before.

550
00:30:07,188 --> 00:30:11,284
She keeps redecorating the nursery
hoping that that's gonna change things.

551
00:30:11,426 --> 00:30:12,484
It's red now. Who...

552
00:30:12,927 --> 00:30:14,485
Whoever heard of a red nursery?

553
00:30:14,629 --> 00:30:17,792
But her students... Her students told her
that it would be good luck.

554
00:30:17,932 --> 00:30:19,126
She wanted to believe them.

555
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:24,501
You operated on her twice today.

556
00:30:24,939 --> 00:30:26,236
You should have known her name.

557
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:42,355
PETE:
You're doing well, Frank.

558
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:44,890
A few weeks,
you should be up and around.

559
00:30:45,026 --> 00:30:48,587
Then what? I told you, I'm done.

560
00:30:49,163 --> 00:30:51,154
- I can't believe that's true.
- I'm resigning.

561
00:30:51,866 --> 00:30:54,061
These guys depend on me.

562
00:30:54,202 --> 00:30:58,104
They can't feel comfortable with me
if they think I'm a freak.

563
00:30:58,239 --> 00:31:00,799
We all feel stress, Frank,
you more than most.

564
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:04,434
But you know what?
You found a way to deal with it.

565
00:31:04,579 --> 00:31:08,481
Some people drink too much,
some eat too much, some people run.

566
00:31:10,018 --> 00:31:11,645
I wish I had a thing that worked.

567
00:31:12,053 --> 00:31:15,147
When everything around you is falling
apart and you need to keep it together,

568
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,054
a thing is good.

569
00:31:18,192 --> 00:31:21,127
So I wear a bra and panties forever.

570
00:31:21,262 --> 00:31:23,196
Maybe if you talked to someone,

571
00:31:23,331 --> 00:31:28,291
maybe if you didn't shoulder all of that
stress yourself, it might be better.

572
00:31:28,436 --> 00:31:31,633
Fine, I'll go to therapy.

573
00:31:31,773 --> 00:31:33,866
But it's still too late.

574
00:31:36,244 --> 00:31:38,804
You run into burning buildings
and save lives.

575
00:31:39,213 --> 00:31:42,046
How many of your men
have you gone in after?

576
00:31:43,551 --> 00:31:45,416
If it's me,

577
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:50,852
I don't care what you're wearing,
as long as you get me out alive.

578
00:31:54,262 --> 00:31:58,062
Six surgeries in 24 hours.

579
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,891
What's it like?

580
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,395
- To be a surgeon?
- To be the best?

581
00:32:04,806 --> 00:32:08,242
I came here to get away
from a bunch of people not talking,

582
00:32:08,943 --> 00:32:11,844
and I ended up
being the one not talking.

583
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,883
Not talking to a single patient.

584
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:19,145
I cut them open, sewed them up,

585
00:32:19,287 --> 00:32:23,656
and I didn't have any idea
who they were.

586
00:32:24,058 --> 00:32:25,719
That's not a doctor.

587
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,556
And it's certainly not the best.

588
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:37,300
Thanks for the job offer, Charlotte,
but I have a job.

589
00:32:37,772 --> 00:32:38,898
A home.

590
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:48,549
I've run every lab I can think of,
there's nothing wrong with Miles' head.

591
00:32:48,683 --> 00:32:50,583
So it's...

592
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,580
- That's just the way he is.
- Your son's fine and he may grow into it.

593
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:57,719
What if he doesn't?

594
00:32:58,359 --> 00:32:59,826
You must think I'm awful.

595
00:32:59,961 --> 00:33:02,930
I should be elated that my son is fine,
it's just...

596
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,895
- He's different.
- Yes.

597
00:33:05,033 --> 00:33:06,091
Me, I was slow.

598
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,862
The other kids could all run faster,
I hated P.E.

599
00:33:09,003 --> 00:33:13,269
My best friend, Brad,
he had two teeth that never grew in.

600
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,069
He's the CEO
of a Fortune 500 company now.

601
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:19,843
And I see a lot of kids, and they're all
different in one way or another.

602
00:33:20,448 --> 00:33:22,814
- He'll be picked on.
- Maybe.

603
00:33:23,951 --> 00:33:26,146
Maybe he'll be a bully,
maybe he'll be president.

604
00:33:26,554 --> 00:33:30,320
You know a lot of the presidents
had big heads: JFK, Lincoln.

605
00:33:30,658 --> 00:33:32,785
He's on Mount Rushmore now.

606
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,025
Thanks.

607
00:33:44,639 --> 00:33:45,970
JESSE:
You made my mom cry.

608
00:33:47,675 --> 00:33:48,801
What did you say to her?

609
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:57,175
I told her that I didn't think I could help you
if you wouldn't talk to me.

610
00:33:57,318 --> 00:33:58,444
What are you doing here?

611
00:33:58,586 --> 00:34:01,953
- Trying to figure out what you won't tell me.
- No. You let this go.

612
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:04,923
My job is to help people,
and I want to help you.

613
00:34:05,059 --> 00:34:07,721
And I am not gonna stop
talking or asking questions

614
00:34:07,862 --> 00:34:09,591
until you answer some.

615
00:34:09,731 --> 00:34:11,665
What happened to the dog?

616
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:14,233
What happened to the dog, Jesse?

617
00:34:14,435 --> 00:34:17,268
Jesse, you loved that dog, didn't you?

618
00:34:17,405 --> 00:34:20,897
You loved that dog, you didn't shed a tear,
and I wanna know why.

619
00:34:21,042 --> 00:34:22,839
- Tell me why.
- Do you know how much it costs

620
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,569
to put a dog down?

621
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,040
Do you? He had cancer.

622
00:34:29,183 --> 00:34:32,152
It was thousands of dollars to treat him,
and she was gonna do it.

623
00:34:32,286 --> 00:34:34,345
My dad's cancer almost bankrupted us.

624
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:35,751
But she was gonna do it

625
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:38,791
because she couldn't bear to see
another thing die again.

626
00:34:40,528 --> 00:34:42,962
She didn't want me
to have to go through it again.

627
00:34:43,097 --> 00:34:44,359
We couldn't afford it.

628
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:47,559
It was 385 dollars to put him down,
we didn't have that either.

629
00:34:47,702 --> 00:34:49,829
So I did what I had to do.

630
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,141
My dog.

631
00:35:02,383 --> 00:35:04,146
I killed him.

632
00:35:05,987 --> 00:35:08,649
Because my dad said
I had to be the man.

633
00:35:10,091 --> 00:35:12,184
I had to be responsible.

634
00:35:14,162 --> 00:35:16,995
WOMAN 1: The schedules.
WOMAN 2: Okay. All right.

635
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:20,190
- Still here?
- Just leaving.

636
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:22,901
Naomi wants me to come back.

637
00:35:24,338 --> 00:35:25,396
She misses you.

638
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,599
She just wants me to come back for her,
not for me.

639
00:35:27,742 --> 00:35:31,178
Dell, when a friend asks you
to step up, you do it.

640
00:35:31,312 --> 00:35:33,177
It's just what you do.

641
00:35:33,314 --> 00:35:34,474
You're part of the family.

642
00:35:35,116 --> 00:35:37,949
Ha. Yeah, I'm the part of the family
they're embarrassed by.

643
00:35:38,085 --> 00:35:40,986
That is not true. You ran away.

644
00:35:41,122 --> 00:35:42,851
You got your feelings hurt
and you ran away.

645
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,787
Now, you may have reason,

646
00:35:44,926 --> 00:35:46,894
but hiding out here,
avoiding your problems,

647
00:35:47,028 --> 00:35:50,225
not talking to the people that need you?

648
00:35:50,364 --> 00:35:52,832
How are you ever
gonna get what you want?

649
00:36:44,151 --> 00:36:45,277
Talking is important.

650
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,820
- Okay.
- Because when you don't talk,

651
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:52,255
- when you don't say what's on your mind...
- What are you talking about?

652
00:36:52,393 --> 00:36:54,725
I mean, you told me
not to talk to you about Sam,

653
00:36:54,862 --> 00:36:57,456
and when I tried to talk to you
about Dell, you walked away.

654
00:36:57,598 --> 00:37:02,467
Because you were using me
as your Addison.

655
00:37:02,937 --> 00:37:06,134
I'm not your Addison. Not anymore.

656
00:37:06,274 --> 00:37:08,401
I used to be, before Addison got here.

657
00:37:08,542 --> 00:37:10,874
And then you just started

658
00:37:12,213 --> 00:37:13,305
talking to her.

659
00:37:15,516 --> 00:37:17,814
You hurt my feelings.

660
00:37:18,386 --> 00:37:23,221
And I know I'm a therapist
and I'm supposed to say that it's all right,

661
00:37:23,357 --> 00:37:24,688
but it's not all right.

662
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:27,020
And you can't just
make me your Addison again

663
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:30,028
and think that makes it all better.

664
00:37:30,531 --> 00:37:32,260
Work it out with Addison.

665
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:35,802
And for God's sake,
stop sleeping with Sam.

666
00:37:35,937 --> 00:37:39,236
Unless you can tell him
how wrong this all is.

667
00:37:39,373 --> 00:37:42,900
His stealing your job
and using you as a sounding board.

668
00:37:43,311 --> 00:37:45,711
And then come talk to me.

669
00:37:46,914 --> 00:37:48,541
When you want to talk to me.

670
00:38:11,939 --> 00:38:13,702
You came back.

671
00:38:14,141 --> 00:38:16,473
- Yeah.
- So is this the new you?

672
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:19,340
You gonna hide out and do surgery
and leave your old friends behind?

673
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:23,473
I wish I felt like my old friends
were my old friends.

674
00:38:23,617 --> 00:38:24,743
You did what you had to.

675
00:38:25,353 --> 00:38:27,913
Telling Sam,
breaking your word to Naomi.

676
00:38:29,623 --> 00:38:31,784
I never said that.
I thought I should say that.

677
00:38:31,926 --> 00:38:33,723
Thanks.

678
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,321
Please.

679
00:38:43,371 --> 00:38:45,339
- Well, this is nice.
- It's nice. Yeah.

680
00:38:45,473 --> 00:38:48,567
Us as friends.

681
00:38:48,709 --> 00:38:51,303
We're past all that, you know,
awkwardness.

682
00:38:51,445 --> 00:38:53,174
- Yeah.
- It's good.

683
00:38:53,314 --> 00:38:57,148
And if we keep at it for a few months,
we could be old friends.

684
00:39:03,391 --> 00:39:04,881
Dell.

685
00:39:05,993 --> 00:39:07,290
SAM:
Yeah.

686
00:39:07,695 --> 00:39:10,289
- I hear you're in charge now.
- Yeah.

687
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:16,831
- What's this?
- It's a list of demands.

688
00:39:16,971 --> 00:39:19,462
- What I need to come back.
- Patients?

689
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:22,075
Supervised. I need the hours
for my midwife's license.

690
00:39:22,209 --> 00:39:23,676
- Sorry, no.
- Sam.

691
00:39:23,811 --> 00:39:26,541
- Hey, he walked out.
- And it's been worse since he's been gone.

692
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,170
No, we can't afford it.

693
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,180
Could you give us a minute, please?

694
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:41,089
- Naomi, we can't add staff...
- I am talking now.

695
00:39:41,228 --> 00:39:42,388
You took my job.

696
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:45,055
You went behind my back,
conspired with my best friend,

697
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:46,257
took over the practice,

698
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,995
and now you think you can just
unilaterally make decisions, or worse,

699
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:52,628
run ideas by me
like none of it ever happened.

700
00:39:52,773 --> 00:39:55,901
Well, guess what, Sam,
I don't wanna hear your ideas.

701
00:39:56,043 --> 00:40:00,104
I'm not your sounding board
and I am not going to help you.

702
00:40:00,247 --> 00:40:01,544
You find somebody else.

703
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:04,380
At least I was smart enough
to find the person

704
00:40:04,518 --> 00:40:07,544
who is standing right outside your door.

705
00:40:20,234 --> 00:40:23,692
You start today. You see patients
only supervised by Naomi

706
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:25,931
or Addison or Pete, and we see.

707
00:40:26,073 --> 00:40:28,371
- I can live with that.
- You resume being office manager.

708
00:40:28,776 --> 00:40:32,735
Vendors, filing, equipment leasing,
scheduling, ordering supplies.

709
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,872
That's yours.
That's what I need from you.

710
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:40,752
And one last demand. It's not on the list.

711
00:40:41,722 --> 00:40:45,419
I want scrubs in a better color. I'm a man,
I'm not wearing those damn pink scrubs.

712
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,459
Welcome back, Dell.

713
00:40:57,371 --> 00:41:00,101
Good. You're here.

714
00:41:00,508 --> 00:41:02,635
Can you get your clothes off?

715
00:41:06,413 --> 00:41:07,573
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

716
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:11,681
There's something wrong, I can tell.

717
00:41:12,019 --> 00:41:13,577
We don't do the talking thing, Cooper.

718
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:17,179
Yes, we do. You yelled at me,
you confirmed I had a big head,

719
00:41:17,324 --> 00:41:20,316
made me feel better.
Let me yell at you, make you feel better.

720
00:41:22,463 --> 00:41:25,057
I'm not letting you get a piece of this
until you start talking.

721
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:34,397
I offered Addison a job
and she turned me down.

722
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:38,101
Can you take your clothes off now?

723
00:41:53,294 --> 00:41:57,458
You like knives, I like guns.

724
00:41:58,365 --> 00:42:00,060
- Centered?
- Mm.

725
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:11,404
Wow. All that not talking.

726
00:42:11,545 --> 00:42:14,378
Talking is overrated.
