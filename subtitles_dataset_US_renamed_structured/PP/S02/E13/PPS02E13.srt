There's nothing else.

173
00:09:09,932 --> 00:09:13,390
So I'm a dead man.
No need to sugarcoat.

174
00:09:13,536 --> 00:09:14,594
I know the drill.

175
00:09:14,737 --> 00:09:19,140
Cancer attacks my liver, my liver fails,
painful death.

176
00:09:19,275 --> 00:09:24,474
Um... Three, four weeks, give or take.

177
00:09:25,448 --> 00:09:27,678
Three hellish weeks.

178
00:09:28,284 --> 00:09:30,445
- I'm sorry.
- I'll do whatever I can to help the pain.

179
00:09:30,586 --> 00:09:34,044
- I'll come to your house.
- We'll do whatever we need to do to help.

180
00:09:34,924 --> 00:09:36,289
That's good.

181
00:09:36,425 --> 00:09:38,985
That's very good,
because I'm gonna need your help.

182
00:09:39,395 --> 00:09:41,488
I want you to help me die.

183
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,727
Okay, the crib'll be delivered tomorrow.

184
00:09:45,868 --> 00:09:47,961
I called my mom, called your mom,
my sister.

186
00:09:54,577 --> 00:09:57,307
MATT: What's wrong?
- Oh, my God, something happened.

187
00:09:57,446 --> 00:09:59,641
- She changed her mind.
- No. No, it's not that.

188
00:09:59,782 --> 00:10:00,840
ADDISON:
Your baby's in the NICU.

189
00:10:00,983 --> 00:10:03,144
He was born with a thoracic hernia.

190
00:10:03,286 --> 00:10:06,346
The organs below the diaphragm
are pushing into his thoracic cavity,

191
00:10:06,489 --> 00:10:08,013
and he's having a hard time breathing.

192
00:10:08,157 --> 00:10:09,852
But the baby's supposed to be healthy.

193
00:10:09,992 --> 00:10:11,050
I know this is a lot,

194
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:13,957
but Addison needs to do the surgery
quickly to help the baby to breathe.

195
00:10:14,096 --> 00:10:15,563
ADDISON:
Now, there are two surgical options.

196
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,599
The first is relatively simple
and will correct the problem for now.

197
00:10:18,734 --> 00:10:21,635
But as the baby grows,
he'll require more surgery.

198
00:10:21,771 --> 00:10:25,730
And the second is higher risk,
but it will be a more permanent solution.

199
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,537
- I can't believe this is happening.
- What does Judy wanna do?

200
00:10:28,678 --> 00:10:30,145
Well, she wants you to decide.

201
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:32,907
- The adoption isn't even final.
- Yeah, which is why I'm here.

202
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,347
Since the birth mother
is abdicating a right to decide,

203
00:10:35,484 --> 00:10:37,577
the hospital will honor your wishes
about what to do.

204
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,711
- But we need a decision now.
- I don't know.

205
00:10:39,855 --> 00:10:42,824
What I would recommend
is the more aggressive approach.

206
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,051
- But he could die?
- Yes.

207
00:10:45,494 --> 00:10:46,859
Um, I can't do this.

208
00:10:46,996 --> 00:10:49,260
You can. Just trust Dr. Montgomery.

209
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,866
I'm sorry, I can't.

210
00:10:56,605 --> 00:10:58,232
I'm sorry.

211
00:11:10,986 --> 00:11:13,614
CHARLOTTE: If that baby boy has no
guardian to make decisions for him,

212
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,951
then the hospital has to
until the state gets involved.

213
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,754
And I can't approve surgery
that's outside the standard of care.

214
00:11:18,894 --> 00:11:22,022
ADDISON: Look, he has a hole
in his diaphragm, Charlotte.

215
00:11:22,164 --> 00:11:25,099
A standard procedure will hold
for a few years, maybe.

216
00:11:25,234 --> 00:11:27,759
But if I go in and do
a muscle transfer and nerve implant,

217
00:11:27,903 --> 00:11:31,100
he has a chance
at a normal, healthy childhood.

218
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,731
- My hands are tied.
- All right, let me talk to the Sinclairs.

219
00:11:33,876 --> 00:11:35,969
- I know them. I can explain this.
DELL: No.

220
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,808
First sign of trouble, they gave up
on this kid. I'll talk to Judy.

221
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,974
If Addison thinks that her surgery is best,
I'll get Judy to authorize it.

222
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,143
- Dell.
- Someone needs to convince someone.

223
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,883
Okay, talk to Judy.
But listen, Dell, I want Violet there.

224
00:11:50,025 --> 00:11:53,017
You know how Judy feels about this.
I want her to be protected.

Definitely beloved.
He's been part of the family for years.

He's gotten used to my difficulties.

- She's here.

She's been entrenched for a long time.

I've heard that for years.

237
00:12:29,698 --> 00:12:32,929
I heard that when she missed my violin
recitals, my school plays, my graduation.

SAM: It is.

or how much we wanna spare him,

in ending a man's life.

- Which he knows how to use

Now we know he knows
and we know what he's gonna do,

There's no family to consider.

263
00:13:40,703 --> 00:13:42,898
- Who wants to die?
- Patient with pancreatic cancer.

264
00:13:43,038 --> 00:13:46,201
Stage 4-B pancreatic cancer,
and he's a doctor.

Well, if he's a doctor,
he's gonna find a way.

- He wants morphine.
- Which we should give him.

That's kind of going out
on a limb there, Dr. Kevorkian.

I will sleep better if I know that I took
seriously the oath to first do no harm.

271
00:14:02,391 --> 00:14:05,019
Well, what does more harm,
helping him die or letting him live?

272
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,856
Exactly. Alexander has nothing left

273
00:14:07,997 --> 00:14:11,228
but the chance to control
when and how the end comes.

274
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:12,401
This is... It's mercy, this is not murder.

This is... It's mercy, this is not murder.

276
00:14:14,537 --> 00:14:16,596
It's a fine line, boys. A slippery slope.

277
00:14:16,739 --> 00:14:19,435
SAM:
Look, I understand the concept of mercy,

278
00:14:19,575 --> 00:14:22,635
but letting nature run its course
is different than helping nature along.

279
00:14:23,045 --> 00:14:24,910
It doesn't matter
how we try to rationalize it.

280
00:14:25,047 --> 00:14:28,539
There is no moral difference
between writing him a prescription

281
00:14:28,684 --> 00:14:29,742
and buying him a gun.

not gonna go through with the adoption.
