00:00:02,285 --> 00:00:03,912
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Previously on</i> Private <i>Practice:</i>

2
00:00:04,054 --> 00:00:06,579
This is business,
and Cooper is personal.

3
00:00:06,723 --> 00:00:08,623
It's not that simple.
You need to tell him.

4
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:10,623
Go. Go to Ghana.

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,751
But come back.
I'm happier when you're here.

6
00:00:12,896 --> 00:00:14,124
You don't lie about rape.

7
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:15,458
That's one of my rules.

8
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:16,690
If we move back in,

9
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:18,733
it won't change the fact
that it wasn't working.

10
00:00:18,868 --> 00:00:20,267
We have to let go.

11
00:00:26,476 --> 00:00:27,602
The power.

12
00:00:27,744 --> 00:00:29,678
The speed, the control.

13
00:00:29,813 --> 00:00:34,876
I mean, who knew go-cart racing
could be better than sex?

14
00:00:35,218 --> 00:00:38,187
Well, if it's better than sex,
I'm not taking you again.

15
00:00:38,321 --> 00:00:39,549
Uh...

16
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:42,487
Okay, almost better than sex.

17
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:47,486
The door's open.

18
00:00:47,997 --> 00:00:49,191
Kevin.

19
00:00:51,935 --> 00:00:53,960
Oh, be careful, Kevin.

20
00:00:55,438 --> 00:00:56,769
Stay put.

21
00:01:18,194 --> 00:01:19,923
L.A.P.D. Get on the ground!

22
00:01:20,063 --> 00:01:21,360
Whoa.

23
00:01:24,734 --> 00:01:27,259
- Archer?
- You're dating a cop?

24
00:01:27,604 --> 00:01:29,094
Archer, this is Kevin.

25
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:32,675
Kevin, this is my brother, Archer.

26
00:01:32,809 --> 00:01:34,868
Will you put some clothes on, please?

27
00:01:41,718 --> 00:01:43,686
PETE:
What are you doing here?

28
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,584
I missed you. And you said you're happier
when I'm here.

29
00:01:46,723 --> 00:01:50,716
So I took some time off. Here I am.
I figured that we can see what this is.

30
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,624
- Right now, it's a great surprise.
- I have another surprise for you.

31
00:01:53,763 --> 00:01:55,025
Does it involve a Kama Sutra?

32
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:57,825
Hey.

33
00:01:57,967 --> 00:01:59,059
That is great.

34
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,227
But there are more natural ways
to quit smoking.

35
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,965
Oh, well, you're the expert.
Where do we start?

36
00:02:10,013 --> 00:02:11,913
I went for a swim.
I think she's a neighbor.

37
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:13,777
So I invited her in to be neighborly.

38
00:02:13,917 --> 00:02:15,179
Oh, this is L.A.

39
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:16,945
No one is neighborly.

40
00:02:17,187 --> 00:02:21,283
Well, in that case, you really should
do something about your alarm system.

41
00:02:21,424 --> 00:02:24,154
But then again, you do have
your own private cop to keep you safe.

42
00:02:24,294 --> 00:02:25,955
Oh, God.

43
00:02:26,095 --> 00:02:27,289
It's good to have you here.

44
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,624
I've missed you.

45
00:02:28,765 --> 00:02:30,960
- Can't find the Barolo.
- Top shelf.

46
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,624
The writing's Italian.

47
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:34,464
He's not a moron. He's smart.
And funny.

48
00:02:34,604 --> 00:02:37,630
- By the way, he's not a cop. He's SWAT.
- So very different.

49
00:02:37,774 --> 00:02:40,334
- Oh, you are such a snob.
- Takes one to know one.

50
00:02:40,643 --> 00:02:43,441
- So you in town for long, Archer?
- No.

51
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,981
My publisher suckered me
into attending his winter launch party.

52
00:02:47,116 --> 00:02:50,244
They parade new authors and their books
to foreign buyers and agents.

53
00:02:50,386 --> 00:02:51,876
He needed some star power.

54
00:02:52,021 --> 00:02:54,990
So I figured it'd give me an opportunity
to come see you and get drunk.

55
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:59,925
Yeah. See, Archer used to be
a world-class neurologist.

56
00:03:00,063 --> 00:03:02,725
But now he makes his living
telling tall tales

57
00:03:02,866 --> 00:03:04,834
about his most disturbing patients.

58
00:03:05,401 --> 00:03:08,302
But really,
he's here to spy on me for Bizzy.

59
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,364
Bizzy?

60
00:03:10,506 --> 00:03:12,201
ARCHER:
God forbid she should let her children

61
00:03:12,342 --> 00:03:14,970
define her identity
by calling her "mother."

62
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,671
She's not happy with you.
You left Derek, you left Seattle.

63
00:03:17,814 --> 00:03:19,611
She thought you'd come back
to civilization.

64
00:03:19,749 --> 00:03:21,444
L.A.'s not civilization?

65
00:03:21,584 --> 00:03:23,609
L.A.'s Sodom and Gomorrah
as far as she's concerned.

66
00:03:23,753 --> 00:03:27,450
Wait until I tell her
that Forbes Montgomery is dating a cop.

67
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,890
- No offense.
- None taken.

68
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:41,232
So in your sessions with Mr. Jarvis,
did he give you any reason to believe

69
00:03:41,371 --> 00:03:43,396
he harbored inappropriate feelings
toward children?

70
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:45,734
I only had three sessions with Hal.

71
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,536
We discussed his divorce.

72
00:03:48,077 --> 00:03:50,409
His job. His feeling isolated.

73
00:03:50,546 --> 00:03:52,377
So they weren't about pedophilia?

74
00:03:52,515 --> 00:03:53,675
Child abuse?

75
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:55,681
Was he struggling
with any sexual issues?

76
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,479
- Not that we discussed.
WARREN: Great.

77
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,178
Now, in your professional opinion,

78
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:02,086
does the fact that Mr. Jarvis
was found in possession of pictures

79
00:04:02,225 --> 00:04:06,355
depicting children in minimal clothing
indicate that he's a danger to children?

80
00:04:07,964 --> 00:04:10,797
Well, any psychiatrist will tell you
that simply possessing materials

81
00:04:10,934 --> 00:04:13,562
doesn't make someone a threat.

82
00:04:14,871 --> 00:04:15,997
But it's a risk factor...

83
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:19,734
WARREN: But risk factors
don't mean he's a predator, do they?

84
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,776
- No.
WARREN: So is it plausible that Mr. Jarvis

85
00:04:22,912 --> 00:04:26,006
could have a pleasant conversation
with a young girl like Jody Sampica

86
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:28,276
without her being in danger?

87
00:04:33,923 --> 00:04:35,254
It's possible.

88
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,691
WARREN:
No further questions, Your Honor.

89
00:04:42,332 --> 00:04:44,163
Attorneys.

90
00:04:47,804 --> 00:04:49,431
Dr. Turner?

91
00:04:49,572 --> 00:04:50,937
Not so fast.

92
00:04:53,076 --> 00:04:54,771
ARCHER:
Okay, so the office is nice.

93
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,139
Quit spying and sit.

94
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,473
ARCHER:
I'm just taking it all in.

95
00:04:57,613 --> 00:05:00,275
Gave her the best view.
Mine has a palm tree in the middle of it.

96
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,577
A generous doctor.
Now, he's appropriate.

97
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,710
Bizzy would love him.
Why aren't you dating him?

98
00:05:04,854 --> 00:05:06,378
ADDISON:
Pete, this is my brother, Archer.

99
00:05:06,522 --> 00:05:08,490
Archer, this is Pete Wilder.

100
00:05:08,624 --> 00:05:10,717
Our alternative-medicine guru.

101
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,157
Wait. Archer Montgomery?

102
00:05:12,295 --> 00:05:14,422
You didn't tell me your brother
was Archer Montgomery.

103
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,964
Well, you know,
I'm just so very, very proud of him.

104
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,860
Let's go to the kitchen.
Get some coffee.

105
00:05:19,002 --> 00:05:20,799
I've read your books.
The one about amnesiacs.

106
00:05:20,937 --> 00:05:22,768
- Forgettable.
- Oh, God.

107
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:25,271
Archer, Addison didn't tell us
you were coming.

108
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,568
Surprise inspection.

109
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:27,767
Look at you.

110
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,810
- Hello.
- The last time I saw you...

111
00:05:29,946 --> 00:05:33,177
She had her head over the toilet
in Bizzy's country house, puking.

112
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:36,413
We're Wasps. We drink. Naomi's
just gonna have to learn to keep up.

113
00:05:36,552 --> 00:05:39,521
Unbelievable. You try to do your civic duty.
I should not have to do this.

114
00:05:39,655 --> 00:05:41,213
- What's up?
- You guys like pedophiles?

115
00:05:41,357 --> 00:05:43,791
- You're about to have one. Every day.
- What?

116
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:46,486
Is this the court case
you were subpoenaed for? Your ex-client?

117
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:49,655
They gave him a suspended sentence.
Mandated therapy with me.

118
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:50,857
Starting today. Here.

119
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,298
No. This is a pediatric office.
We have children here.

120
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:56,701
It's after hours.
He has to be out by 9, in after 7.

121
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,602
I'm... I'm sorry. I didn't realize...

122
00:05:58,741 --> 00:06:00,538
ADDISON:
Oh, my brother, Archer. Archer, Violet.

123
00:06:00,676 --> 00:06:02,303
Hello.

124
00:06:03,646 --> 00:06:05,773
- Hi.
- Stop that.

125
00:06:05,915 --> 00:06:07,940
- Back to the pedophile.
- All right, this is wrong.

126
00:06:08,084 --> 00:06:11,884
- A sex offender here at this office?
- He's Violet's patient. He needs help.

127
00:06:12,021 --> 00:06:15,388
You rather have him roaming the halls,
looking at my wall of kid photos?

128
00:06:15,525 --> 00:06:18,050
And what if, God forbid,
he should target one of them?

129
00:06:18,995 --> 00:06:20,462
Oh, damn it, Dell.

130
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,599
I'll talk to him.

131
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,399
Is this a bad time to mention
you're all invited to a party tonight?

132
00:06:29,705 --> 00:06:32,071
Look, Dell, I know this might be
particularly hard on you...

133
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,402
I got hit a lot, okay?

134
00:06:33,543 --> 00:06:35,977
By someone who made me feel
like if I told, I'd get it worse.

135
00:06:36,112 --> 00:06:37,739
I can only imagine
if it was sexual abuse.

136
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,313
All abuse is bad. I know that.

137
00:06:39,882 --> 00:06:41,645
But most abusers
were themselves abused...

138
00:06:41,784 --> 00:06:43,012
No, that's a crap excuse.

139
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:46,178
I don't like this any more than you do, Dell.
But if you wanna talk about...

140
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:48,313
He's coming in tonight, right?
I'm leaving early.

141
00:06:55,098 --> 00:06:57,032
I'm not the only one who objects
to your patient.

142
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,600
Why are you all mad at me?
It was a court mandate.

143
00:06:59,735 --> 00:07:01,999
Oh. Oh, did something else happen?

144
00:07:02,138 --> 00:07:04,163
Besides the pedophile?
What are you talking about?

145
00:07:04,307 --> 00:07:05,706
No, I came in here in a great mood.

146
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:09,209
- Really? So you and Charlotte...?
- Are great. We're great.

147
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,745
I'm thinking about asking her
to move in with me.

148
00:07:13,616 --> 00:07:15,140
Great.

149
00:07:19,956 --> 00:07:21,082
Don't worry about money.

150
00:07:21,224 --> 00:07:22,350
The clients will be rich.

151
00:07:22,492 --> 00:07:24,483
We want the offices to feel rich.

152
00:07:24,627 --> 00:07:25,685
You haven't told Cooper?

153
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:28,729
Excuse me while I handle something.

154
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,124
- I'm not something to be handled.
- We're on the same side?

155
00:07:32,268 --> 00:07:35,101
You're opening up a practice
that competes with your boyfriend's,

156
00:07:35,238 --> 00:07:37,638
in his building, you're in charge,
and you haven't told him?

157
00:07:37,773 --> 00:07:39,536
- I will find the right moment and when l...

158
00:07:39,675 --> 00:07:42,075
You know, I don't like you, Charlotte.
But Cooper does.

159
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,269
So do us both a favor.

160
00:07:43,412 --> 00:07:45,243
Just tell him. Tonight.

161
00:07:48,684 --> 00:07:50,481
So tell us.

162
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,484
Two of your triplets
are sharing the same blood vessels

163
00:07:53,623 --> 00:07:54,715
and circulation system.

164
00:07:54,857 --> 00:07:58,293
This baby's heart is pumping too hard
because it's not getting enough blood.

165
00:07:58,427 --> 00:07:59,689
It's becoming starved.

166
00:07:59,829 --> 00:08:02,798
This baby's heart is failing
because it's getting too much blood.

167
00:08:02,932 --> 00:08:04,991
- Oh, my God.
- What about the third one?

168
00:08:05,134 --> 00:08:07,068
Luckily, she doesn't share
the same blood supply,

169
00:08:07,203 --> 00:08:08,602
so she doesn't seem to be affected.

170
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,935
And what I'd like to do is operate,
to separate the blood supplies.

171
00:08:12,608 --> 00:08:14,235
You wanna cut into me?

172
00:08:14,377 --> 00:08:16,709
The babies are showing signs
of early heart failure, Tess.

173
00:08:16,846 --> 00:08:19,474
If we wait on surgery,
in 90 percent of the cases,

174
00:08:19,615 --> 00:08:21,583
one or both babies won't survive.

175
00:08:21,717 --> 00:08:23,947
And it could affect the third.

176
00:08:24,187 --> 00:08:25,449
This is my fault.

177
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,614
Everyone kept asking
when it was gonna be my turn.

178
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,623
I wanted a baby so badly.

179
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,355
We should have waited.

180
00:08:32,795 --> 00:08:35,491
Doing IVF, we were tempting God.

181
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:39,163
God is not punishing you
for trying to have these children.

182
00:08:39,468 --> 00:08:40,992
GREGORY:
Dr. Bennett put in one embryo.

183
00:08:41,137 --> 00:08:42,934
And it divided into three babies.

184
00:08:43,072 --> 00:08:44,596
Now that's a miracle.

185
00:08:46,909 --> 00:08:48,934
They could all die from the surgery,
couldn't they?

186
00:08:49,812 --> 00:08:51,336
That's always a possibility, yes.

187
00:08:52,148 --> 00:08:54,378
And if we do nothing,

188
00:08:54,517 --> 00:08:56,212
there's a chance it's all okay.

189
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,051
A small one.

190
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:09,728
I'm sorry.

191
00:09:09,865 --> 00:09:11,127
We can't do the surgery.

192
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,799
We can't interfere again.

193
00:09:13,102 --> 00:09:16,128
God will provide for them.

194
00:09:16,272 --> 00:09:17,637
He has to.

195
00:09:26,716 --> 00:09:30,345
I'm saying laparoscopic surgery
comes with inherent risks.

196
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,113
Fetal survival rate is 50 percent
at best?

197
00:09:32,255 --> 00:09:35,190
Which is 40 percent better than doing
nothing at all. We should push them.

198
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:37,758
Wait, you can't push a couple
to go against their beliefs.

199
00:09:37,893 --> 00:09:39,656
TTTS syndrome in triplets.

200
00:09:39,795 --> 00:09:41,660
Two of the babies are affected.
Surgery or not?

201
00:09:41,797 --> 00:09:44,391
The couple has faith everything's
gonna work out. Surgery or not?

202
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:47,263
- It's like <i>Dr. Jeopardy.</i>
- There's something to be said about faith.

203
00:09:47,403 --> 00:09:49,496
We've seen cases
where you can't explain the healing.

204
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:52,199
And we've all seen cases
where we do nothing, the patient dies.

205
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,673
You did your due diligence,
you laid out the options,

206
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:57,938
- and gave your recommendation.
- You feel qualified to judge their beliefs?

207
00:09:58,147 --> 00:10:00,707
I'm not saying that there's no place
for religion in medicine.

208
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,444
I'm just saying that I prefer
to put my faith in what we can do.

209
00:10:03,586 --> 00:10:06,521
Maybe it's not your patient's faith
that's being tested. It's yours.

210
00:10:06,656 --> 00:10:08,715
- He'd be good for you.
- Oh, shut up.

211
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:11,954
Excuse me.

212
00:10:12,261 --> 00:10:13,626
I'm here to see Dr. Turner.

213
00:10:16,098 --> 00:10:19,295
Hal. Hal, why don't we go back?

214
00:10:25,608 --> 00:10:27,542
I don't blame them.

215
00:10:27,777 --> 00:10:29,608
What I am,

216
00:10:29,745 --> 00:10:30,803
I know it's sick.

217
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,645
Well, that's why you're here.

218
00:10:32,782 --> 00:10:36,650
I'm sorry I didn't tell you the truth
when I came before.

219
00:10:36,786 --> 00:10:39,448
That's why I was so depressed.

220
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:41,488
The secret was crushing me.

221
00:10:42,992 --> 00:10:44,755
Do you know what that's like?

222
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,488
Hiding a piece of yourself?

223
00:10:47,997 --> 00:10:50,488
Especially a piece you hate?

224
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,331
Well, secrets are hard. On everyone.

225
00:10:53,469 --> 00:10:57,303
This may sound crazy,
but getting caught,

226
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,200
it's been freeing.

227
00:10:59,342 --> 00:11:02,072
I mean, because I can't hide.

228
00:11:02,945 --> 00:11:04,003
I have to get help.

229
00:11:04,547 --> 00:11:07,675
I just wanna get the thoughts
out of my head.

230
00:11:08,284 --> 00:11:10,013
Thoughts of these girls.

231
00:11:10,152 --> 00:11:11,710
It's awful.

232
00:11:13,456 --> 00:11:15,481
It's sick.

233
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:20,689
And if l... If I did anything...

234
00:11:21,997 --> 00:11:24,761
What? What would happen?

235
00:11:25,801 --> 00:11:28,895
They would become what I am.

236
00:11:32,141 --> 00:11:33,267
Because you were abused.

237
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,637
And I hated it.

238
00:11:38,314 --> 00:11:40,509
And I liked it.

239
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:45,082
And it tore me apart.

240
00:11:45,688 --> 00:11:48,122
And I don't wanna do that to anyone.

241
00:11:50,926 --> 00:11:52,655

I cleaned, I reorganized. Shoot me now.

How about you take tomorrow off,
we stay in bed all day?

251
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,554
If I'd known you were coming,
I could've rescheduled.

252
00:12:24,693 --> 00:12:26,854
Will you at least come home early?

253
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,293
I'll see what I can do.

Thank you.

Hey, where's your prodigal brother?

259
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,518
He's showing Kevin around.
Hopefully making nice.

260
00:12:52,655 --> 00:12:54,589
Apparently Archer
didn't appreciate Kevin

261
00:12:54,723 --> 00:12:56,953
treating him like a criminal
when they first met.

262
00:12:57,092 --> 00:12:59,356
- When he broke in like a criminal?
- Exactly.

263
00:12:59,495 --> 00:13:02,623
Well, it looks like
they're making nice now.

00:13:03,265 --> 00:13:05,756
ARCHER: Can I ask you a question?
- Shoot.

265
00:13:05,901 --> 00:13:07,994
Shoot. That's funny.

00:13:08,137 --> 00:13:10,230
- What are you doing with my sister?

Hey, um, so, what did you

He was just giving me
the lay of the land.

316
00:15:23,439 --> 00:15:24,667
I know he can be arrogant.

317
00:15:24,807 --> 00:15:28,299
Okay? But he's just his mother's son,
and he's my big brother.

00:15:28,444 --> 00:15:29,672
And he'd do anything for me.

- Yeah, I'll just get my wrap.

Good thing I'm not polite.

that's gonna stay in his head.
