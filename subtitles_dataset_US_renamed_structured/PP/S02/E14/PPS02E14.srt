- Working for Charlotte.
- For now.

You should knock before you walk
into a doctor's office. It was funny.

Twice I come to town,
twice you walk in on me.

- I have a patient.
- I know.

8
00:00:18,735 --> 00:00:21,135
Jane Williams,
30 years old, 33 weeks pregnant.

9
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,966
Ambulance brought her in,
she had a stroke.

- How...?
- Good, you're both here.

11
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:28,240
You met my new neurologist. Your patient
has neurological problems. I called him.

12
00:00:28,378 --> 00:00:31,006
Okay, Tim,
can you tell me what happened?

13
00:00:31,147 --> 00:00:33,980
She was eating breakfast,
and we were arguing.

14
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:36,517
Suddenly, her orange juice drops,
it falls out of her hand,

15
00:00:36,653 --> 00:00:39,588
and there's orange juice everywhere,
and Jane can't speak.

16
00:00:39,723 --> 00:00:42,590
- Baby's heartbeat is normal.
- Jane, I'm Dr. Montgomery.

17
00:00:42,726 --> 00:00:45,217
Can you understand what I'm saying?
Are you in any pain?

what he's saying, nod your head.

20
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,125
Okay, just try to relax.
We're here to help you.

21

When did this happen,
the orange juice and the not talking?

22
00:00:54,738 --> 00:00:56,205
An hour ago? Maybe longer?

23
00:00:56,339 --> 00:00:59,240
I need you to be as exact as possible.
It's important.

24
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:03,436
- An hour and 20 minutes ago.
- Good. Good, then we still have time.

25
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,673
She didn't have a stroke,
she's having one right now.

in the next hour and 40 minutes,

28
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:12,315
- any permanent brain damage.
- And what about the baby?

29
00:01:12,455 --> 00:01:14,719
If you treat Jane,
what happens to the baby?

30
00:01:30,573 --> 00:01:31,835
Okay.

31
00:01:31,975 --> 00:01:33,806
Did the fight cause this?

32
00:01:33,943 --> 00:01:36,275
Strokes can just happen,
often without warning.

00:01:36,412 --> 00:01:38,972
There are no predictors.

- You two...?
- The divorce has been ugly.

35
00:01:42,652 --> 00:01:45,246
She hates that this baby
keeps me in her life.

36
00:01:45,388 --> 00:01:48,380
That was the last thing she said
right before she...

37
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,655
She wished that she wasn't pregnant.

38
00:01:51,995 --> 00:01:53,963
So she'd never have to see me again.

39
00:01:54,097 --> 00:01:56,224
Good news.
There's no evidence of a bleed,

40
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,857
which means I can perform
an endovascular clot evacuation.

41
00:01:59,002 --> 00:02:00,094
Excuse me just a minute.

42
00:02:00,236 --> 00:02:02,227
I don't want you fishing around
inside her brain.

43
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:06,172
- You should use TPA to bust the clots.
- It's contraindicated in pregnancy.

44
00:02:06,309 --> 00:02:09,301
No, it's not. Not in the studies I've read.

The procedure is something I can control.

48
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:20,215
And if Jane's life were at risk,
it might make sense.

49
00:02:20,356 --> 00:02:23,484
But this stroke isn't gonna kill her
or the baby. What you're proposing could.

50
00:02:23,626 --> 00:02:26,094
- What about her quality of life?
- The baby is 33 weeks.

51
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:29,357
Its lungs aren't fully developed.
It needs more time, TPA offers that.

say I'm a great one. You used to say it.

00:08:24,353 --> 00:08:26,287
They're divorced.
And they barely speak.

167
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:29,289
Well, I guess they spoke
long enough to conceive.

168
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:32,417
Speaking of not speaking, are we gonna
have a fight about Naomi again?

169
00:08:32,562 --> 00:08:34,792
- You think I'm mad about Naomi?
- Good, you're not mad.

170
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,364
This is you, not mad.

171
00:08:36,499 --> 00:08:38,831
Like the time I loaned your sweater
to Crystal McCullough.

172
00:08:38,968 --> 00:08:42,199
She puked on it. She puked up
strawberry daiquiri all over my sweater.

173
00:08:42,338 --> 00:08:43,737
But you weren't mad.

174
00:08:43,873 --> 00:08:46,933
I wasn't mad that you loaned it,
I was mad that you lied.

175
00:08:47,076 --> 00:08:48,236
And I'm not mad about Naomi.

176
00:08:48,377 --> 00:08:51,835
I'm mad that you took a job
with a practice that is trying to bury me.

177
00:08:51,981 --> 00:08:54,074
You knew,
and you didn't have the guts to tell me.

178
00:08:54,217 --> 00:08:57,846
Wyatt left chasing some
ridiculous amount of pharmaceutical cash.

179
00:08:57,987 --> 00:08:59,978
So Charlotte needed a big name,
who better but me?

180
00:09:02,225 --> 00:09:03,385
Why are you here, Archer?

181
00:09:03,993 --> 00:09:05,927
There were some things
I wanted to get away from.

182
00:09:06,062 --> 00:09:08,326
Like? Stalker ex-girlfriend?

183
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:11,024
Publisher who knew where you lived?
There's always something.

184
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:14,330
After the way we left things,
I wanted to try again, make it better.

185
00:09:14,837 --> 00:09:18,170
Like, let's do this case.
See how much you enjoy working with me.

186
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,867
- So long as we do it your way?
- Well, that would help.

187
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:23,672
It's the right way, Addy.

188
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:25,710
NAOMl:
I'm just concerned.

189
00:09:25,848 --> 00:09:29,147
Look, I know I'm a 52-year-old litigator
and not a 19-year-old cheerleader,

190
00:09:29,285 --> 00:09:32,812
but, um, my gynecologist started me
on hormone therapy

191
00:09:32,955 --> 00:09:36,550
- and he thinks I'm ready for implantation.
- Yeah, but it's not just age.

192
00:09:36,692 --> 00:09:39,661
The stress of losing your daughter?
That takes its physical toll

193
00:09:39,795 --> 00:09:42,992
and doesn't exactly make you
an ideal candidate for IVF.

194
00:09:43,132 --> 00:09:46,590
Terri wanted to bring a baby
into this world more than anything.

195
00:09:46,736 --> 00:09:50,035
And I can do that.
I can bring her baby into the world.

196
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:55,376
Well, your gynecologist was right.
You are certainly ready.

197
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,139
But having your own grandchild?
You're still grieving, Sharon.

198
00:09:58,281 --> 00:10:00,772
This isn't about grief.

199
00:10:01,484 --> 00:10:03,349
This is about honoring my daughter.

200
00:10:07,923 --> 00:10:09,390
I've never seen Keith that bad.

201
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,550
You have to call the police
and let them handle it.

202
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,561
- I know how you feel about addicts, Dell...
DELL: I'm not being punitive.

203
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,564
I'm not mad. The guy needs help.
You tried, and it's not working.

204
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,225
And at least in jail,
he'll have to go cold turkey.

205
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:23,270
- Jail isn't the answer for him.
- I don't know. I think Dell's right.

206
00:10:23,406 --> 00:10:25,533
- Thank you.
- Keith needs to be in a program.

207
00:10:25,675 --> 00:10:29,202
I've talked to him before. I know he has it
in him to get clean with the right help.

208
00:10:29,345 --> 00:10:30,972
You think
you can get through to this guy?

209
00:10:31,414 --> 00:10:33,348
I think I should try.

[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]

211
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:42,221
ADDISON: Jane, I know that you wanna
talk to us, and I know that you're scared,

212
00:10:42,358 --> 00:10:45,350
but all these people, all this equipment,
is to help you get better.

213
00:10:45,494 --> 00:10:47,985
ARCHER: I'm gonna give you
some sedative to keep you comfortable,

214
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:51,691
But I need for you to be awake
so that we can test things as we go, okay?

215
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:55,326
I need you to trust me.
My sister trusts me. So can you.

216
00:10:56,739 --> 00:11:00,869
ADDISON: Your baby is doing great.
ARCHER: Stay with me, Jane. Okay?

217
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:03,103
We're gonna get you through this.

218
00:11:07,216 --> 00:11:11,084
I brought you a peace offering.
Your favorite: Fritters, warm apple.

219
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,347
Deep fried
for your southern taste buds.

220
00:11:15,858 --> 00:11:17,223
We have breakfast here, Cooper.

221
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,523
Well, maybe you can skip breakfast here,
and we can...

222
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:24,191
Look, I understand you're angry.
But you can't not talk to me.

223
00:11:24,734 --> 00:11:27,202
I'm sorry I said no about the marriage,

224
00:11:27,336 --> 00:11:30,066
but I did tell you I wanted
to spend the rest of my life with you.

225
00:11:30,206 --> 00:11:32,674
Can you tell me what I did wrong
that's so unforgivable?

226
00:11:32,808 --> 00:11:35,971
If you really don't get it, I can't help you.

227
00:11:37,313 --> 00:11:41,716
- Well, we have to talk about this.
- No. We don't. And we won't.

228
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:45,810
Save the rest of your earnest little "I can
make it all better" act and leave, okay?

229
00:11:55,564 --> 00:11:57,361
It's good, isn't it?

230
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:00,529
See, this is fortuitous, finding you here.

231
00:12:00,669 --> 00:12:02,728
We need to talk,
and you've been avoiding.

232
00:12:02,905 --> 00:12:04,532
Avoidance isn't good for anyone, Violet.

233
00:12:04,673 --> 00:12:06,766
I'm not avoiding you, Sheldon.
I've been very busy,

234
00:12:06,909 --> 00:12:08,774
and I have a patient waiting.

235
00:12:08,911 --> 00:12:11,846
- Hey, Cooper, you going back up?
- Oh, good, you guys are talking.

236
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,814
- At least someone's talking.
- In fact we're not talking.

237
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,578
VIOLET: We're talking, Sheldon.
I love talking to you.

238
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,951
- I love spending time with you. I'm just...
- Busy. I know.

239
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,416
COOPER:
Cute kids.

240
00:12:24,193 --> 00:12:26,127
Over there, Sheldon.

241
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,593
- Ah. Don't you think?
- I guess. In small doses.

242
00:12:29,732 --> 00:12:32,599
I'm not really a kid person.
They don't seem to like me.

243
00:12:32,735 --> 00:12:35,670
- So you don't have kids of your own?
- No. God, no. Thankfully.

244
00:12:35,805 --> 00:12:38,535
You must see them in your practice?
I bet you're great with them.

245
00:12:40,309 --> 00:12:42,436
You know what I find?
I'm okay with kids.

246
00:12:42,578 --> 00:12:46,708
In short bursts. Beyond that...
Well, it's not a problem, is it?

247
00:12:51,587 --> 00:12:53,851
- You miserable or starving?
- Both.

248
00:12:54,423 --> 00:12:56,755
- Anything you wanna talk about?
- This is doing the trick.

249
00:12:58,394 --> 00:13:01,420
- Terri Hughes' mother came in today.
- Why?

250
00:13:01,564 --> 00:13:05,000
We have Terri and Mark's embryos in our
freezer. And she wants them implanted.

251
00:13:05,134 --> 00:13:06,658
In her.

252
00:13:08,237 --> 00:13:10,501
- I don't know what to do.
- I do. Say no.

253
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,540
Well, I know there are issues
with her carrying her own grandchild,

254
00:13:13,676 --> 00:13:16,770
- and her age, but Sharon seems to...
- I'm not interested in Sharon's reasons.

255
00:13:17,246 --> 00:13:19,612
Terri was my patient.
I'm interested in what she'd think.

256
00:13:19,748 --> 00:13:23,047
- And she would never, ever want this.
- How can you be so sure?

257
00:13:23,185 --> 00:13:25,153
Terri hated her mother.

258
00:13:25,287 --> 00:13:29,223
Giving that woman another child,
Terri's child,

259
00:13:29,358 --> 00:13:30,825
would have been her worst nightmare.

260
00:13:39,702 --> 00:13:43,365
ARCHER: Okay, I'm twisting the coil,
capturing the clot.

261
00:13:43,506 --> 00:13:46,202
A few more minutes,
I'll be able to pull it out of there,

262
00:13:46,342 --> 00:13:48,503

back to normal.

ADDISON: She's having contractions.

265
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,442
ARCHER: You have to stop that.
ADDISON: I will. Draw up terbutaline.

266
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,448
ARCHER: Quickly.
ADDISON: Focus, don't nick a vessel.

267
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:59,611
Jane, I know you're in pain,
but I need you to stay still as possible.

268
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,723
ARCHER: We're running out of time.
ADDISON: Give it a minute.

269
00:14:01,857 --> 00:14:04,849
NURSE: Heart rate's up, 120, 140.
ARCHER: Addison.

270
00:14:04,994 --> 00:14:07,792
ADDISON: It's a side effect of the
terbutaline. Just a few more seconds.

271
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,093
ARCHER: Stay with us, Jane, okay?
ADDISON: Contractions are slowing.

272
00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:13,266
ARCHER:
Okay, captured the clot.

273
00:14:14,036 --> 00:14:16,231
Removing the coil,

274
00:14:17,373 --> 00:14:19,864
I'm injecting the dye.

275
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,543
Well, isn't that a pretty sight?

276
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,638
No, no. Okay, all right.
Do you think it's ever appropriate

277
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,910
for a mother to be implanted
with the embryos of her daughter?

278
00:14:30,052 --> 00:14:33,112
I was dreading the choice between power
berry and dragon fruit vitamin water.

279
00:14:33,255 --> 00:14:36,315
Okay, mothers act as surrogates
for their daughters all the time.

280
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,585
If Sharon wants a baby so badly,
let her adopt.

281
00:14:38,727 --> 00:14:41,218
Sharon doesn't want any child,
she wants their child.

282
00:14:41,363 --> 00:14:42,489
She doesn't deserve it.

283
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:45,156
I don't like it any more than you do,
but if I don't do it...

284
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,735
Well, she just goes to another doctor
for implantation, right?

285
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,098
I mean, they're her property.

286
00:14:49,238 --> 00:14:51,832
- By law, I'm not saying they should be.
VIOLET: She's 52.

287
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,032
There are very few doctors

288
00:14:53,175 --> 00:14:55,507
who could successfully impregnate
a woman her age.

289
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,942
If Naomi says no,
then the problem ends here.

290
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,072
But isn't getting older women pregnant
part of the beauty of IVF?

291
00:15:01,216 --> 00:15:04,674
They get to have time, have careers,
and still be moms.

292
00:15:05,454 --> 00:15:07,922
And what does that mean for their kids?

293
00:15:08,057 --> 00:15:13,552
I mean, can you imagine volunteering
to be team mom in soccer in your 50s?

294
00:15:13,696 --> 00:15:16,028
Or going prom dress shopping
in your 60s?

295
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,656
I don't know, maybe the fact that Terri

296
00:15:18,801 --> 00:15:20,666
hated her mother
makes the decision for me.

297
00:15:20,803 --> 00:15:24,864
- I don't have to worry about age or grief.
- Yes, yes. She should not be a mother.

298
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:28,340
People become parents at different times
in their lives for different reasons.

299
00:15:28,477 --> 00:15:31,469
It's not always ideal. If this woman
is willing to make a good-faith effort

300
00:15:31,614 --> 00:15:34,105
to be the kind of parent
she knows she should have been before,

301
00:15:34,249 --> 00:15:36,149
why would we be against that?

302
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:40,845
Isn't that what this baby,
any baby, deserves?

303
00:15:49,932 --> 00:15:52,696
Pretty good team, you and me.

304
00:15:54,003 --> 00:15:56,062
No. We are not a good team.

305
00:15:57,006 --> 00:15:58,997
I made a life here, Archer.

306
00:15:59,575 --> 00:16:04,706
Away from Bizzy, away from Derek.
I'm trying to figure out me.

307
00:16:04,847 --> 00:16:07,645
And I can't do that with you

308
00:16:07,983 --> 00:16:11,419
- judging everything that I do.
- I will be supremely supportive.

309
00:16:12,988 --> 00:16:15,422
You don't know
how to stay out of my life.

310
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,286
You never have.

311
00:16:17,426 --> 00:16:18,654
And when I needed someone

312
00:16:18,794 --> 00:16:22,252
to make Phil Davidson pay for
leaving me out at the lake, that was great.

313
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,729
But now,

314
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:27,393
when I'm struggling
to find my footing in this place that's mine.

315
00:16:27,536 --> 00:16:32,132
- I miss you.
- I miss you. But this isn't a visit.

316
00:16:32,274 --> 00:16:35,937
You're in my city. You're in my building.
You're sleeping with my best friend.

317
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:40,947
- I mean, you're in my patient's brain.
- I'm not moving in with you, Addy.

318
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,108
I just wanted to be closer.

319
00:16:44,453 --> 00:16:46,444
You have to go.

320
00:16:47,289 --> 00:16:51,316
I love you, but you have...
You have to go.

321
00:17:13,749 --> 00:17:15,808

486
00:26:37,078 --> 00:26:40,377
Look at me and Sam.
Married, divorced and awkward.

487
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:43,882
Now, we're actually talking to each other
about our love lives with other people.

00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,145
- You are?
- Yeah.

489
00:26:45,287 --> 00:26:48,017
And if Sam and I can get past all that,
surely you and Archer can.

Hey.

- Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.

Yeah.

SHARON:
My daughter hated me. I know that.

496
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:10,674
I have no idea
what she told you about me, but l...

497
00:27:10,812 --> 00:27:14,475
- I imagine it wasn't flattering.
- Well, I could say that that is privileged.

498
00:27:14,616 --> 00:27:18,882
But I don't think that'd help either one of us
to understand what's going on here.

499
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,248
So yes.

500
00:27:20,922 --> 00:27:22,822
Terri had negative feelings.

501
00:27:22,991 --> 00:27:27,087
That's why I'm not sure
what you're asking for is a good idea.

502
00:27:28,763 --> 00:27:32,392
I do corporate litigation.
I'm good at my work. I love it.

503
00:27:32,867 --> 00:27:35,734
And when I got pregnant,
everyone told me:

504
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:38,737
"Don't worry, it'll be amazing,
it'll change your life."

505
00:27:38,873 --> 00:27:41,501
And it did, but it wasn't amazing.

506
00:27:41,643 --> 00:27:44,510
It was hard and exhausting and...

507
00:27:46,147 --> 00:27:49,014
It didn't make me feel anything
like work ever did.

508
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:52,847
So Terri's sense that you resented her,
it had some basis in fact?

509
00:27:52,987 --> 00:27:55,046
I loved my daughter. Very much.

510
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:59,388
But she changed my life
from being in control and fulfilled

511
00:27:59,527 --> 00:28:03,019
to feeling constantly overwhelmed
and inadequate.

If motherhood for you
was more burden than blessing,

515
00:28:12,006 --> 00:28:14,372
why would you wanna subject yourself
to that again?

516
00:28:14,509 --> 00:28:16,977
Because I want it
to be different this time.

517
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,774
- But what makes you assume it could be?
- The pain.

518
00:28:20,248 --> 00:28:23,615
I've lived with it every single day
while she was alive.

519
00:28:23,752 --> 00:28:26,084
Not being what she needed.

520
00:28:26,221 --> 00:28:29,816

I would be able to

make the relationship right.

522
00:28:35,263 --> 00:28:41,725
I can't bring Terri back,
but I can have the child that she wanted.

523
00:28:43,438 --> 00:28:50,207
And give it love and attention
and the support that she would've...

524
00:28:51,045 --> 00:28:53,411
That she deserved.

It's early, but I think it'll be okay.

- Hey, um...

The baby is in distress,
and Jane's not dilated, but I can't wait.

I gotta do a C-section, but she's still
on blood thinners from your procedure.

I need to reverse them or she'll bleed out.

- That'll put her at risk for another stroke.
- The baby can't survive without surgery.

Uh...

538
00:29:37,592 --> 00:29:39,389
What if I do a C-section with a spinal?

00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:42,394
Can you do an intraoperative EEG,
monitor the neurostatus?

live together, no vacations planned,

But we're still a couple. We're us.

- Hey, will you sign a 5150?

557
00:31:07,348 --> 00:31:09,475
For Keith Embry. He's a drug addict.

558
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:12,586
You can't lock up an addict
and force him into treatment, Pete.

559
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,211
It's more than that.
He's living on the streets, got no job.

560
00:31:15,356 --> 00:31:17,324
- Not eating, got no clothes.
- Grave disability.

561
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:19,551
- You've done your homework.
- Think it's a bad idea?

562
00:31:19,694 --> 00:31:22,128
I think... I think it's better
when people want treatment.

563
00:31:22,263 --> 00:31:23,696
Forced treatment is problematic.

564
00:31:23,831 --> 00:31:26,493
And with addicts,
I mean, he'll just lie to you, Pete.

565
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:28,602
If he stays on the streets,
he's gonna die.

566
00:31:28,736 --> 00:31:31,261
But 72 hours in a psych facility
isn't gonna change that.

Seventy-two hours to evaluate,
choose to do a 14-day hold, then 30 days.

568
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:37,369
Does he have a support system?
A wife or kids?

569
00:31:37,512 --> 00:31:41,471
He has a wife, but no kids.
Thank God. That'd be a disaster.

570
00:31:41,616 --> 00:31:44,779
Well, kids can inspire things in people
that adults can't.

571
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:46,784
I mean, if he'd had kids...

572
00:31:46,921 --> 00:31:49,116
I mean, wouldn't it make a difference
if you'd had kids?

573
00:31:49,257 --> 00:31:50,781
I'm passed that window.

574
00:31:50,925 --> 00:31:55,419
The sad truth is it's probably better
that Anna and I didn't have kids.

00:31:55,563 --> 00:31:59,124
I'm too selfish. And I get angry.

So will you sign the 5150?

577
00:32:06,608 --> 00:32:09,441
You know, when you force something
on someone that they don't want,

578
00:32:09,577 --> 00:32:11,135
they'll never fully commit.

579
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,407
So if he doesn't want this for himself,

580
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:16,483
he'll just walk out the door.

00:32:48,483 --> 00:32:50,747
Yet. Laryngoscope
and a suction catheter, now.

About Sharon using Terri's embryos.

602
00:33:25,486 --> 00:33:29,047
- What about Terri?
- I was thinking about Terri growing up.

603
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:32,159
About how she must have felt,
and how kids intuitively know

604
00:33:32,293 --> 00:33:33,624
if their parents resent them.

605
00:33:34,495 --> 00:33:37,794
But I was also thinking
that children only see one side.

606
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:41,090
And that if a parent
understands their feelings,

607
00:33:41,235 --> 00:33:43,465
and really wants to change...

608
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,031
I actually think Sharon
will be a different mom this time around.

609
00:33:50,878 --> 00:33:54,609
And she's not just trying
to replace her daughter? It's not guilt?

610
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:59,017
Maybe the fact that she's committed
to being a good mom.

611
00:33:59,921 --> 00:34:03,482
Maybe that's reason enough
to give her a second chance.

You're not destined to be anything.

643
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:46,155
You have a chance
to be whatever you want.

644
00:35:46,294 --> 00:35:49,593
And if the person you were before
wasn't working,

645
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,322
you can change it.

646
00:35:52,366 --> 00:35:55,164
And you can be the kind of mother
that you think that that baby,

647

that Terri's baby deserves.

00:36:03,544 --> 00:36:07,605
it'll be amazing. For both of you.

650
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:11,077
This is the chance you wanted, right?

651
00:36:13,521 --> 00:36:15,045
Then take it.

652
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,454
Okay.

653
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:22,722
Okay.

654
00:36:36,844 --> 00:36:39,836
Hey. He's beautiful.

655
00:36:39,981 --> 00:36:43,109
Breathing on his own.
You did good, Jane.

656
00:36:45,553 --> 00:36:46,952
Yes, you did.

657
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:51,148
Want me to hand you the baby?

658
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,423
[CRYING]

659
00:36:53,561 --> 00:36:57,429
I'm glad you're here.

660
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:25,288
Anxiety-induced asthma.
What do you have?

661
00:37:25,426 --> 00:37:26,654
- For Sam?
- Yeah.

662
00:37:26,794 --> 00:37:29,456
- I don't need anything.
- Yes, he does. Sonya is a problem.

663
00:37:29,597 --> 00:37:31,155
- We haven't...
- Sealed the deal.

664
00:37:31,299 --> 00:37:32,459
SAM:
St... Well...

665
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,730
We've tried, but I just...
I get nervous, and then I start to wheeze.

666
00:37:36,871 --> 00:37:40,432
Butterbur and dried ivy.
Steep it in hot water for five minutes.

667
00:37:40,574 --> 00:37:43,702
One big glass should help reduce
bronchoconstrictions for a few hours.

668
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:45,709
Good luck.

669
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:51,076
- What?
- It's just...

670
00:37:51,319 --> 00:37:55,119
After everything you two have
been through, you're still... You're friends.

671
00:37:55,256 --> 00:37:57,952
- Is that weird?
- No, no, no.

672
00:37:58,092 --> 00:38:00,652
- It's great.
- I think so.

673
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:03,796
Yeah.

674
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:11,001
She still not talking to you?

675
00:38:11,572 --> 00:38:16,305
I opened my soul, and nothing.

676
00:38:21,849 --> 00:38:23,407
Pete doesn't want kids.

677
00:38:26,287 --> 00:38:28,346
Sheldon doesn't want kids.

678
00:38:28,489 --> 00:38:30,457
Pete doesn't want kids.

679
00:38:31,459 --> 00:38:33,359
I don't want kids.

680
00:38:34,495 --> 00:38:35,962
You know?

681
00:38:36,097 --> 00:38:39,362
I mean, what business do I have
having a kid?

682
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,263
Me.

683
00:38:41,602 --> 00:38:44,469
Raising a kid by myself that I don't want.

684
00:38:44,605 --> 00:38:46,800
- Wouldn't know what to do with.
- You're not alone.

685
00:38:46,941 --> 00:38:49,842
Every night,
I wake up in a cold sweat, Cooper.

686
00:38:50,644 --> 00:38:52,839
I lay there panicked.

687
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:57,980
That I'm gonna wait too long.
I'm gonna wait too long.

688
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:02,411
And then it'll be too late to have
an abortion, and I will just be stuck.

689
00:39:02,556 --> 00:39:04,217
And I'll never be free ever again.

690
00:39:04,358 --> 00:39:05,757
- Violet.
- I don't know what to do.

691
00:39:05,893 --> 00:39:08,589
All I know is that unless
you're bringing me sticky buns

692
00:39:08,729 --> 00:39:10,594
and gyros and burgers then...

693
00:39:10,831 --> 00:39:12,924
Heh, heh, I'm lost, Cooper.

694
00:39:13,067 --> 00:39:16,969
I mean, I see you and I feel better,
but most of the time, I walk around lost

695
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:20,972
and alone and scared.

696
00:39:24,045 --> 00:39:25,103
Well, then I will be here.

697
00:39:26,981 --> 00:39:30,974
Whenever you need me, I will be here,
and we'll sit, and we'll eat.

698
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:34,713
We'll figure this out.
We'll work through everything

699
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:38,156
and make it okay. Together.

700
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:45,961
- You'd do that for me?
- I'd do anything for you.

701
00:39:59,046 --> 00:40:01,207
I am not glad
that you are working for the enemy.

702
00:40:01,348 --> 00:40:03,942
And you're gonna have to learn
to stay out of my personal life.

703
00:40:04,085 --> 00:40:05,814
But if you wanna be here, then...

704
00:40:08,122 --> 00:40:09,487
This is gonna be fun.

705
00:40:10,024 --> 00:40:11,548
[CHUCKLES]

706
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:27,432
- Thought you had a date.
- I canceled.

707
00:40:28,976 --> 00:40:33,003
- So no good-time guy?
- I don't know.

708
00:40:33,147 --> 00:40:35,115
All I know is
that I was getting ready for a date,

709
00:40:35,249 --> 00:40:37,342
and I realized
that I would rather be with you.

710
00:40:40,154 --> 00:40:42,349
So I'm more than a good-time girl.

711
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:45,425
Now, I never said you were a
good-time girl. Good-time guy, that's me.

712
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:47,288
No, you...

713
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,159
You're a keeper.

714
00:40:50,731 --> 00:40:52,790
Are you gonna let me in?

715
00:40:59,073 --> 00:41:03,476
- Where's your child?
- Oh, um, she is at a sleepover.

716
00:41:03,611 --> 00:41:06,774
Well, then let's get you naked.

717
00:41:19,593 --> 00:41:21,424
Peace offering.

718
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,219
Corn bread chicken casserole.

719
00:41:24,798 --> 00:41:26,993
Momma used to bring it
to the neighbors to make peace

720
00:41:27,134 --> 00:41:29,193
after Landry and Duke let their pigs out.

721
00:41:30,171 --> 00:41:32,002
It's the only thing I know how to make.

722
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,842
I screwed up, Coop.

723
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:38,135
And I wanna make it right.

724
00:41:38,279 --> 00:41:41,112
So I was thinking,

725
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:42,875
you wanted me to move in
a few months ago.

726
00:41:43,017 --> 00:41:45,679
Maybe now, that's the right thing to do.

727
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,681
A good first step.

728
00:41:51,625 --> 00:41:52,717
What's the matter?

729
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:01,459
- Going somewhere?
- I'm moving in with Violet.
