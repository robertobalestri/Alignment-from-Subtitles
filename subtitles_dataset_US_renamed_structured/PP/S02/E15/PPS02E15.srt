Patty,

684
00:37:49,917 --> 00:37:51,407
Michelle's gonna keep you safe.

685
00:37:51,886 --> 00:37:53,444
She's gonna help you get through this.

686
00:37:53,921 --> 00:37:56,185
You and Felix are gonna watch out
for one another.

687

I'll still be your doctor.

Thanks.

- Patty's...
- I heard.

Called Social Services
soon as she went under, and the police.

Charlotte.

695
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:37,625
It's been a terrible day, Charlotte.

696
00:38:39,033 --> 00:38:42,366
I looked that girl's parents in the eye

697
00:38:42,837 --> 00:38:44,532
and they do not care.

698
00:38:44,672 --> 00:38:46,435
The surgery's good,
the surgery's gonna help.

699
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,099
But at the end of the day, that girl

700
00:38:49,844 --> 00:38:52,438
doesn't have parents anymore.

701
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:57,179
And the only thing I can think
of that might make me feel any better

702
00:38:58,252 --> 00:39:00,083
is being with you.

703

I know being with you
would make me feel better.

Violet's pregnant. That's the secret.

705
00:39:11,165 --> 00:39:14,931
That's why I'm moving in with her,
because she's freaking out.

00:39:15,403 --> 00:39:17,030
Are you...?

707
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,702
- Is it your...?
- No.

I'm not the father. I'm the best friend.

709
00:39:21,976 --> 00:39:25,309
Violet has always been there for me.

710
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:26,970
She shouldn't have to do it alone.

711
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:28,911
What about me?

712
00:39:29,483 --> 00:39:32,316
- I love you.
- What about me when I have our baby?

713
00:39:33,387 --> 00:39:35,548
Your first child
was supposed to be with me.

714
00:39:37,525 --> 00:39:40,187

were supposed to be ours.

Yeah.
