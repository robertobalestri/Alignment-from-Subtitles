No, no. In and out.

00:00:28,978 --> 00:00:30,673
You gotta breathe in too,
not just out.

5
00:00:30,814 --> 00:00:32,645
In. In.

6
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:33,874
No, no. You're not...

7
00:00:34,017 --> 00:00:37,350
Not like a vacuum cleaner.
Like a normal person.

8
00:00:37,487 --> 00:00:39,978
- Relax.
- That's easy for you to say.

00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:43,115
You're not gonna have 8 pounds

Ah. Okay, I don't... No visual.

CHARLOTTE:
This is visual enough for me.

12
00:00:47,163 --> 00:00:49,893
The point of me staying over
wasn't to wake up next to a pillow.

13
00:00:50,033 --> 00:00:51,500
- You can always leave.
- I know.

But I agree to adult sleepovers

- Charlotte, I'll be right there.

- Hey. No Phillip today?
MALCOLM: Hey.

00:01:21,064 --> 00:01:22,622
He couldn't get off work.

24
00:01:22,766 --> 00:01:26,258
On the upside, he promises me
a bigger budget for the baby's room.

25

But I don't mind. It's not his thing.

- How long have you been like this?
JANINE: A week maybe.

34
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,988
I walk up a flight of stairs
and I feel like I need to take a nap.

35
00:01:50,126 --> 00:01:52,321
Since Phillip has diabetes,
you think this is related?

36
00:01:52,462 --> 00:01:55,056
- Gestational diabetes or something?
- No, there's no association.

Let me just have you sit up.

- Dell, get an ambulance for me.
- Dr. Montgomery?

I don't want you to panic,
but I hear a little bit of fluid in your lungs,

46
00:02:19,956 --> 00:02:22,516
which could indicate a problem
with your heart.

Yes, yes.

Doctors think HMOs
are about denying healthcare.

58

you can give people who are sick.

00:02:58,394 --> 00:02:59,759

a part of an HMO. Not ever.

00:03:24,487 --> 00:03:27,115
No. Most of my life, I've been a rich ass.

You are the preeminent

You helped fund one of the first

And in the past year,

89
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,329
you've had to deal with finances
and internal power struggles.

It's still my practice.

I'm talking about, say, the guy
who created the first embryonic stem cell.

I'm talking about giving full wellness care
to people who can't afford it.

99

You set the agenda, then hire
whoever you want to make it work.

00:04:56,446 --> 00:04:59,040
Well, entertain it now.

Yeah, everything's great.

I know testing urine is a crappy job,
but jeez, Sam, lighten up.

What is it? Another UTI?

120
00:05:52,001 --> 00:05:54,526
Well, yeah,
you do have a urinary tract infection,

121
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,537
but you also tested positive
for chlamydia.

122
00:05:58,841 --> 00:06:00,468
Now, the good news
is that it's treatable.

123
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:05,070
So I'm gonna give you a prescription
for sulfa for the UTI

124
00:06:05,214 --> 00:06:08,980
and doxycycline for the chlamydia.

125
00:06:10,219 --> 00:06:13,586

how you might have contracted this?

How did I let my marriage come to this?

Well, this is not your fault.
Now, if you need help in dealing with this...

Oh, no, no, no. I'll figure it out.

That's what I do, I figure things out.

on the problem, the answer will be clear."

Sounds so easy to say, doesn't it?

138
00:06:50,393 --> 00:06:53,760
No, it's tough to know
when you're ready for it to be over.

139
00:06:54,964 --> 00:06:58,764
Well, I'd better pull myself together
and get back to school.

00:07:00,403 --> 00:07:02,166
Give me the prescription.

00:07:02,305 --> 00:07:03,966
Okay.

- Hi.

152
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,335
Nice to meet you.
How many weeks are you?

153
00:07:33,469 --> 00:07:36,404
- Uh, 35-ish?
LISA: Well, you've got the glow.

154
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,171
Being a parent, nothing compares.

155
00:07:39,308 --> 00:07:41,868
So I've heard.
I'm really looking forward to it.

156
00:07:45,181 --> 00:07:46,409
See you later? Okay.

157
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,016
Bye.

158
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,217
Nice. She's, uh...

159
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,690
I like her.

Her heart's just not working anymore?

162
00:08:02,832 --> 00:08:04,390
It's called cardiomyopathy.

163
00:08:04,534 --> 00:08:06,024
The heart muscle becomes inflamed.

164
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:09,002
In this case, the added pressure
on Janine's heart from the baby

165
00:08:09,138 --> 00:08:11,038
caused it to progress rapidly.

166
00:08:11,174 --> 00:08:13,734
From all the tests,
it looks like it's been going on for a while.

167
00:08:13,876 --> 00:08:16,208
I'm afraid that the damage
is irreversible.

Stop. It's nobody's fault.

00:08:26,022 --> 00:08:27,080
So, what do we do?

173
00:08:27,223 --> 00:08:28,747
She is going to need a new heart.

174
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,592
Oh, my God. I'm going to die?

175
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:36,027
No, that's what you're telling me,
I'm pregnant and I'm going to die.

176
00:08:36,165 --> 00:08:37,462
How fast can we get a heart?

177
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,658
We need to notify UNOS.

178
00:08:38,801 --> 00:08:41,497
Get her on a list. It could take time.

179
00:08:41,637 --> 00:08:42,968
How long can her heart hold out?

180
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,471
It's impossible to tell, but not for long.

181
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,975
The pregnancy is making
your heart work harder.

182
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:53,548
Which is why, Janine, I think
that you need to consider a termination.

183
00:08:53,683 --> 00:08:55,708
No. No.

184
00:08:55,851 --> 00:08:58,183
ADDISON: Janine, at 20 weeks,
the baby can't survive.

185
00:08:58,321 --> 00:09:01,051
We need to relieve the pressure
on your heart till we find a new one.

186
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:04,057
She kicks. She kicks me.

187
00:09:04,193 --> 00:09:06,753
She's alive in there. Please.

188
00:09:06,896 --> 00:09:08,295
We can't take that kind of risk.

189
00:09:08,731 --> 00:09:13,464
Janine, I want this baby as much as you,
but we need to buy you more time.

190
00:09:13,603 --> 00:09:16,436
You're not listening, Phil.
She doesn't wanna lose the baby.

191
00:09:16,572 --> 00:09:18,005
JANINE:
No, I can't lose the baby.

192
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,439
You have to save us both.
I'm begging you.

193
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,916
COOPER:
Hey, Bobby. Bobby, it's Dr. Cooper.

194
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:30,678
- My body's on fire.
- You're having an allergic reaction.

195
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,788
We need to figure out
what you've been exposed to.

196
00:09:32,922 --> 00:09:35,186
- So, what you've been eating.
- I don't know.

197
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,586
Try to do better than that.

198
00:09:36,726 --> 00:09:38,523
If you took something
you weren't supposed to,

199
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,152
you're not gonna get into any trouble,
but you need to tell me.

200
00:09:41,297 --> 00:09:43,891
BOBBY: L...
- Look, you need to check him for pills.

201
00:09:44,033 --> 00:09:46,297
Check his pockets.
Check everything he came in here with.

202
00:09:46,435 --> 00:09:50,235
Draw up 125 of Solu-Medrol
and 50 of diphenhydramine.

203
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:51,931
NURSE: Okay.
DONNA: Is he gonna be okay?

204
00:09:52,074 --> 00:09:53,803
I'm Bobby's teacher. I found him.

205
00:09:53,943 --> 00:09:56,138
Did you see anything?
Has he been taking anything?

206
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:58,577
Mrs. Keating, thank you.

207
00:09:58,714 --> 00:10:01,308
- Is Bobby okay?
- He's having a severe allergic reaction.

208
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,815
We're trying to figure out what.

209
00:10:02,952 --> 00:10:04,852
And he's in here, you should go in.

210
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:06,579
Donna.

211
00:10:06,722 --> 00:10:08,587
DONNA: Sam.
- Sam?

212
00:10:09,425 --> 00:10:10,619
What's going on?

213
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,057
My student, he's in there.

214
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,424
The sulfa you gave me
and the doxycycline?

215
00:10:14,563 --> 00:10:17,623
I gave him both and he's reacting.
You have to tell the doctor what he took.

216
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:20,964
- Oh, no, Donna.
- You can't tell them.

217
00:10:21,103 --> 00:10:23,128
You can't tell them Bobby and I are...

218
00:10:23,506 --> 00:10:25,371
That I'm sleeping
with one of my students.

219
00:10:29,845 --> 00:10:32,370
She's not a vulture.
She's not a predator.

220
00:10:32,515 --> 00:10:35,484
- She was confused.
- I have no sympathy, except for the boy.

221
00:10:35,618 --> 00:10:36,676
How's Bobby?

222
00:10:36,819 --> 00:10:38,548
COOPER:
He's... You know, he's stabilized.

223
00:10:38,688 --> 00:10:40,883
He's alert. Rash is not progressing.

224
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,253
- Stevens-Johnson's Syndrome?
- He reacted to the sulfa.

225
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:46,657
He's lucky. People can't just
give other people their prescriptions.

226
00:10:46,796 --> 00:10:49,026
She was trying to help.
What did he tell his parents?

227
00:10:49,165 --> 00:10:52,032
He said that a friend gave him some pills
so he could stay awake, study.

228
00:10:52,168 --> 00:10:53,726
Now they're happy he's doing better.

229
00:10:53,869 --> 00:10:55,769
Bobby is a minor. This is statutory rape.

230
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:59,170
She should not have slept
with her student, all right? Absolutely not.

231
00:10:59,308 --> 00:11:01,572
But he's gonna be 18, in what,
like a month?

232
00:11:01,711 --> 00:11:03,201
You spoke to him, it was consensual.

233
00:11:03,346 --> 00:11:05,473
I mean,
he said he made the first move, but...

234
00:11:05,614 --> 00:11:07,104
That does not absolve her,

235
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:10,013
and it doesn't absolve you
of your legal duty to report this.

236
00:11:10,152 --> 00:11:13,451
- To protect him.
- But in a few weeks, it won't be a crime.

237
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:16,581
What good is it gonna do
either of them if I report this?

238
00:11:16,726 --> 00:11:19,559
She's gonna lose her job, her credentials.
He's gonna end up humiliated.

239
00:11:19,695 --> 00:11:21,686
DELL:
Oh, he'll be a rock star.

240
00:11:22,832 --> 00:11:23,958
Mary Kay Letourneau, hot.

241
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,260
That boy was 13 years old.

242
00:11:25,401 --> 00:11:28,598
So by comparison,
Sam's patient's done nothing wrong.

243
00:11:28,738 --> 00:11:31,366
What 17-year-old hasn't wanted to sleep
with one of his teachers?

244
00:11:31,507 --> 00:11:34,442
Donna was in a position of power,
and she abused that.

245
00:11:34,577 --> 00:11:36,511
Why assume
a 17-year-old isn't mature enough?

246
00:11:36,645 --> 00:11:38,579
Because he's being forced
to grow up too quickly.

247
00:11:38,714 --> 00:11:41,842
To make decisions about his life
that he's just not ready to make.

248
00:11:41,984 --> 00:11:43,315
Think about yourself at 17.

249
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:48,253
I was mature, all right? Heather wasn't.
But thank you, Naomi, for the free therapy.

250
00:11:50,526 --> 00:11:54,121
All right, if this were Maya
and a 35-year-old male gym teacher...

251
00:11:54,263 --> 00:11:56,322
Well, I would kill him.
But that's not the...

252
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:59,628
I know that there's a double standard here,
but it's different when it's a girl.

253
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:00,895
- It is.
- It shouldn't be.

254
00:12:01,036 --> 00:12:02,833
SAM:
Look, I hate abuse.

255
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,099
But I don't think
that's what we're dealing with here.

256
00:12:05,241 --> 00:12:06,606
Donna is not a criminal.

257
00:12:06,742 --> 00:12:08,801
Now, as long
as she doesn't see him again,

258
00:12:08,944 --> 00:12:11,344
that's all we want, isn't it?

259
00:12:13,382 --> 00:12:16,909
Even if she gets the new heart,
he won't look after her.

260
00:12:17,052 --> 00:12:19,316
- He's not gonna take care of her.
- Phillip?

261
00:12:19,455 --> 00:12:22,515
He sends me in his place.
Who does that?

262
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:25,183
Even now,
he's in the lobby on his BlackBerry.

263
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,955
This is his baby. His wife.

264
00:12:28,097 --> 00:12:29,792
He should be here for her, you know?

265
00:12:30,266 --> 00:12:33,394
There still isn't a heart,
but Janine is at the top of the list.

266
00:12:33,536 --> 00:12:35,902
I've also got a call in
to the head of UNOS.

267
00:12:36,038 --> 00:12:37,471
Janine's blood type O, so am I.

268
00:12:37,606 --> 00:12:39,870
It's the most common.
It shouldn't be so hard.

269
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:43,240
That works in her favor,
but organ donation is a difficult process.

270
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:45,939
- Supply can't meet the demand.
- I wanna do something.

271
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:48,474
If I could give her my heart...

272
00:12:48,617 --> 00:12:50,107
We're gonna find you one.

273
00:12:50,252 --> 00:12:54,484
How long do Janine and the baby have
to find a heart before they die?

274
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:57,922
Forty-eight hours.

275
00:13:09,138 --> 00:13:10,503
Isn't that someone else's job?

276
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,539
I can't stop. Nesting.

277
00:13:12,675 --> 00:13:14,870
I see mess or clutter
or things out of place and...

278
00:13:17,313 --> 00:13:20,749
So she seems nice.

279
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,475
Lisa. And her kid is cute.

280
00:13:22,618 --> 00:13:24,313
Yeah, I like them.

281
00:13:25,855 --> 00:13:27,652
What? What's wrong?

282
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:31,692
I just hate it that you're maybe
carrying my baby and I didn't tell her.

283
00:13:31,827 --> 00:13:33,920
- You think you should?
- You think I shouldn't?

284
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,497
It's just... You're happy.

285
00:13:36,632 --> 00:13:37,929
And I'm all for full disclosure,

286
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:41,696
but do you think you should tell her
something before there's anything to tell?

287
00:13:41,837 --> 00:13:43,270
SHELDON:
Violet.

288
00:13:45,274 --> 00:13:48,402
Oh, sorry, Pete.
Were you two in the middle of a?

289
00:13:48,544 --> 00:13:49,909
Just finishing.

290
00:13:53,716 --> 00:13:55,877
- Are those for me?
- No, for me.

291
00:13:56,018 --> 00:13:59,215
From a patient. She's in love with me.

292
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,724
Her name is Anita.

293
00:14:02,858 --> 00:14:05,918
I started treating her a few months ago.
She was painfully shy.

294
00:14:06,061 --> 00:14:07,756
She wanted me to help her
be more assertive

295
00:14:07,897 --> 00:14:10,297
with a co-worker
she had fallen in love with.

296
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,866
She didn't know how to talk to him.

297
00:14:13,002 --> 00:14:15,266
And as she realized
how easy it was to talk to you,

298
00:14:15,404 --> 00:14:16,803
she channeled her love to you.

299
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,907
- It's classic transference.
- Clearly.

300
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,669
- You don't have to say it like that.
- Like what?

301
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:25,473
Like a woman couldn't fall in love with me
unless it was a therapeutic mistake.

302
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:29,550
- I didn't say that.
- I can be very charming, you know.

303
00:14:29,685 --> 00:14:30,879
- I know.
- Well...

304
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:36,219
I was just saying that it happens,
that it's part of the process.

305
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,753
Are you having your own feelings?

306
00:14:38,894 --> 00:14:42,261
This is not about counter-transference.

307
00:14:42,398 --> 00:14:47,392
I mean, granted my love life
is at best complicated right now,

308
00:14:47,536 --> 00:14:50,004
but I just wanted to talk to a colleague.

309
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,970
I guess, go on record if nothing else.

310
00:14:52,107 --> 00:14:57,238
But also to see if you had any secrets.

I think you won't fail.

Dell, I'm going out, so if my 2:00 gets here
before I do, put her in a room for me.

318
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,607
Yeah, what else would I do?

00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,582
Dell, later we're gonna have a talk.

And I mean a come-to-Jesus talk.

You're not my mother, Naomi.
You're not even my boss.

is wearing thin, Dell.

Get it together, Dell.

326
00:16:05,481 --> 00:16:10,475
I'd just found out about Bill's affair.
From his e-mail.

327
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,854
There were lots of e-mails
from different women.

328
00:16:12,988 --> 00:16:15,252
Pictures.

329
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,291
They were all so young.

- And Bobby?
- He just got transferred into my class.

The way he looked at me, it just...

333
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,005
It just made me feel better.

334
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:34,439
He'd find reasons to stay after

You think I killed him.

that I just sit here and watch?

674
00:34:27,348 --> 00:34:30,784
Just because you haven't found her yet,
doesn't mean you won't.

- Hi.

00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,193
What's going on?

677
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,359
I wanna believe
that it won't be a problem.

678
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:51,995
That I can be there for you
and Ben and the baby.

679
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,665
Yeah, the baby has to come first.
I get that.

680
00:34:54,809 --> 00:34:56,709
I can make that work.

681
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:58,971
I need to be there for both of them.

682
00:34:59,113 --> 00:35:02,480
For the baby and for Violet.

684
00:35:07,255 --> 00:35:10,156
Okay, well,
I guess it's better you know now

685
00:35:10,291 --> 00:35:12,885
before anyone gets hurt.

686
00:35:14,629 --> 00:35:17,792
I'd like to keep treating Ben.
I don't want this to affect him.

687
00:35:17,932 --> 00:35:19,627
Uh...

688
00:35:21,235 --> 00:35:23,203
I don't know, Pete.

689
00:35:29,343 --> 00:35:32,403
- Hey, you are testing Phillip's blood?
- Mm-hm.

690
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,481
Why? I mean, the ME's doing that.

691
00:35:34,615 --> 00:35:36,776
I think he did it. Malcolm.

692
00:35:36,918 --> 00:35:38,943
I think he murdered his brother
and I need evidence.

693
00:35:39,086 --> 00:35:40,451
I need proof.

694
00:35:40,755 --> 00:35:44,247
Addison, we just pulled off
the unthinkable.

695
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:47,987
I mean, two lives were almost gone,
and then a heart dropped in our laps.

696
00:35:48,129 --> 00:35:50,290
Now they're gonna live. It's a miracle.

697
00:35:50,431 --> 00:35:53,332
You and I did it.
Can't we just focus on that?

698
00:35:53,467 --> 00:35:54,525
I can't.

699
00:35:54,669 --> 00:35:57,832
Phillip's dead
and Malcolm might get to be with Janine.

700
00:35:57,972 --> 00:35:59,599
Why's he gotta be a bad guy?

701
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:02,106
Maybe he's just a guy
who didn't get along with his brother.

702
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,471
You told me he was a good guy.

Good people don't murder their brothers
and then get to sleep with their wives.

Can't they just be two people in love?
I mean, why try and tear them apart?

00:36:09,984 --> 00:36:14,045
Okay, Noah, there are lines and rules
and things that you can't do.

00:36:14,188 --> 00:36:16,656
I mean, they shouldn't be together.
It's wrong.

Autopsy results came back.

an accidental insulin overdose.

Guess it all worked out.

- I still think he did it.
- There isn't any proof.

711

You kissed me back.

You're angry at me.

You say that I'm at fault.

00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:48,581
But it isn't just that I kissed you.
It's that you kissed me back.

Bobby, honey, listen to me.

Don't let them tell you that.
Don't let them make you feel this is wrong.

I'm twice your age.

722
00:37:26,193 --> 00:37:28,753
Age doesn't matter, Donna. I love you.

723
00:37:28,896 --> 00:37:37,964
You're 17, and I was in a really bad place
and I needed you, but I don't love you.

00:37:39,874 --> 00:37:42,365
You're lying.
They're making you say this.

Bobby, you have your whole life
ahead of you.

726
00:37:45,613 --> 00:37:47,706
No one's saying that this isn't real,
what you feel.

727
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:50,510
What we both feel. You know it.

No, I'm sorry.

Bobby, I know that you love her.

But sometimes the best thing to do
when you love someone and it's not right

- Just a bit of business.

how my practice was doing.

You were right.

742
00:39:07,294 --> 00:39:13,324
I wasn't being honest.
And I think maybe I should be.

00:39:16,003 --> 00:39:17,334
You know what I think?

744
00:39:17,471 --> 00:39:22,170
I think that what we're doing is too hard.

but I still care about you.

and what you're doing, it's just...

but I can't and I shouldn't have to.

- We can't be friends anymore.

Oh, Sheldon, what happened?

00:41:03,978 --> 00:41:05,741
Anita thought
I was gonna confess my love.

763

When I insisted her feelings were
misplaced, she beat me with the roses.

- It was great.
- It was great?

I forced her.
I pushed her to a breakthrough, Violet.

And when she saw what she did to me,
she broke down.

00:41:17,191 --> 00:41:20,319
She realized she'd spent so much money
on gifts for the wrong person.

You know,
you gotta put something on that.

is I had a breakthrough of my own.
