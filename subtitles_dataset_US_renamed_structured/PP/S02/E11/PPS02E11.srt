1
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:08,284
[BOTH PANTING]

2
00:00:16,733 --> 00:00:18,598
Should we...

3
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:20,527
...talk about this?

4
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,001
No.

5
00:00:22,138 --> 00:00:23,196
No talking.

6
00:00:23,907 --> 00:00:26,307
My life has too much talking.

7
00:00:27,711 --> 00:00:30,009
How does Kevin
leave one sock behind?

8
00:00:30,146 --> 00:00:32,307
I mean, don't you think he'd notice
that one bare foot

9
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,007
when he went to put his shoes on?

10
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:35,879
Call him.

11
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,045
ADDISON:
He walked out.

12
00:00:38,988 --> 00:00:40,080
You miss him.

13
00:00:40,223 --> 00:00:41,986
Call him.

14
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,524
You wanna go get a drink tonight?

15
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,560
I'll figure it out better
when I'm drunk.

16
00:00:45,695 --> 00:00:48,721
I can't. I have to work.

17
00:00:48,865 --> 00:00:50,890
Work? Wyatt work?

18
00:00:51,034 --> 00:00:52,092
Pacific Wellcare work?

19
00:00:52,235 --> 00:00:53,566
Work for the enemy?

20
00:00:53,703 --> 00:00:56,968
Oncofertility is new and it's interesting.

21
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,301
You think Wyatt's interesting.

22
00:00:59,442 --> 00:01:02,707
Well, he is.

23
00:01:02,846 --> 00:01:05,076
- He's arrogant.
- Yeah, but he's smart.

24
00:01:05,215 --> 00:01:07,706
And incredibly handsome.

25
00:01:07,851 --> 00:01:09,614
You're not really...

26
00:01:09,753 --> 00:01:11,618
Okay, you know what, never mind.
I am...

27
00:01:11,755 --> 00:01:13,518
- None of my business.
- Exactly.

28
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:17,023
You wanna sell your soul,
I'll still be your friend.

29
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:29,331
When I used to go in for chemo,
to help me get through it,

30
00:01:29,472 --> 00:01:31,702
I'd concentrate
on exactly what was going to happen.

31
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,502
And when you implanted
the ovarian tissue,

32
00:01:33,643 --> 00:01:37,875
I tried to imagine the blood starting to flow,
and my ovaries starting to work again.

33
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,710
Claudia, this is not your fault.

34
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,545
The tissue is very fragile,

35
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:46,348
and your body has been through
much more than any body should.

36
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:48,855
I just thought if I was positive,
it would work.

37
00:01:48,992 --> 00:01:51,483
I picked out the crib
and I painted the nursery yellow.

38
00:01:51,628 --> 00:01:54,893
We tried, Claudia. There just wasn't
enough blood supply in your abdomen

39
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,430
for the ovarian tissue to survive.

40
00:01:56,566 --> 00:01:57,828
And there's nothing else?

41
00:01:59,002 --> 00:02:00,560
I'm not gonna be able to have a baby?

42
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:04,764
Well, no, we only implanted half of the
ovarian tissue that you took out.

43
00:02:04,908 --> 00:02:05,966
- Right?
- Right.

44
00:02:06,109 --> 00:02:08,077
But we just saw,
the procedure doesn't work.

45
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,076
No, my procedure doesn't work.

46
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:13,011
But if we were to implant
the ovarian tissue deeper,

47
00:02:13,149 --> 00:02:15,982
more proximate
to a more vigorous blood supply, then...

48
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:17,245
- Next to the uterus?
- Yeah.

49
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,412
Well, what you're saying
is theoretically possible,

50
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,820
but the surgery
is far too complicated.

51
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:23,357
- I don't know anyone that...
- I do.

52
00:02:24,861 --> 00:02:26,089
And this person could help me?

53
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:27,990
I don't know.

54
00:02:28,531 --> 00:02:30,431
I'll have to ask her.

55
00:02:37,006 --> 00:02:38,405
Sorry. Betsey.

56
00:02:39,876 --> 00:02:42,003
Pacific Wellcare ruins another day.

57
00:02:42,145 --> 00:02:43,203
And a shirt.

58
00:02:43,346 --> 00:02:46,543
- Heather was supposed to pick her up.
- It's okay. I've got another shirt.

59
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,443
DELL: Honey, maybe not such a good
idea to throw balls...

60
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,417
It wasn't her fault. It was mine.

61
00:02:51,554 --> 00:02:54,079
COOPER: What wasn't your fault, champ?
- Oh, Dr. Freedman.

62
00:02:54,224 --> 00:02:55,748
Arlene? Hi.

63
00:02:55,892 --> 00:02:58,520
Oh, my God. Is this Michael?
Dude, you're a giant.

64
00:02:58,661 --> 00:02:59,923
Will? You remember me?

65
00:03:00,964 --> 00:03:03,432
Jeffrey. That's a pretty cool plane.

66
00:03:03,566 --> 00:03:04,726
Hey, let's go back. Come on.

67
00:03:06,236 --> 00:03:08,932
So where you been? It's been...

68
00:03:09,873 --> 00:03:11,135
...two years.
- Yeah.

69
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,003
I moved the boys to Switzerland.

70
00:03:13,142 --> 00:03:14,200
For Jeffrey.

71
00:03:14,344 --> 00:03:17,575
I found this great experimental
program there for autistic children.

72
00:03:17,714 --> 00:03:19,375
Non-traditional therapy.

73
00:03:19,515 --> 00:03:23,815
Megavitamins, diet modification,
along with art, music therapy.

74
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,113
How's it been going?

75
00:03:25,255 --> 00:03:27,416
Better. I think.

76
00:03:27,557 --> 00:03:30,287
His temper's under control a little more.

77
00:03:30,426 --> 00:03:32,451
He's obsessed with airplanes.

78
00:03:32,595 --> 00:03:36,964
Sometimes he'll even talk to you,
as long as it's about planes.

79
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,761
COOPER:
Planes are good.

80
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:43,035
Talking about planes, even better.

81
00:03:43,773 --> 00:03:47,368
- How's his health otherwise?
- Jeffrey's fine. No, it's Michael, actually.

82
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,944
He caught a cold on the plane.

83
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,205
It's probably just some bug,

84
00:03:51,347 --> 00:03:53,907
- but, you know, I want to be safe.
- Oh, right. Up for you.

85
00:03:55,218 --> 00:03:57,243
So how'd you like Switzerland,
Michael?

86
00:03:57,387 --> 00:03:59,378
They had a cable car
and there's this one place

87
00:03:59,522 --> 00:04:01,046
where you can take
a chocolate tour.

88
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,454
And my best friend
has sheeps and cows at his house.

89
00:04:03,593 --> 00:04:05,493
What? Sheeps and cows?

90
00:04:05,628 --> 00:04:06,788
His house?

91
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,491
- I made butter.
- You did? You made butter? Really?

92
00:04:12,402 --> 00:04:13,801
A hundred and two.

93
00:04:13,937 --> 00:04:15,461
- Does your throat hurt, Michael?
- No.

94
00:04:15,605 --> 00:04:16,970
COOPER:
Okay.

95
00:04:17,106 --> 00:04:19,165
Open up for me. Big and wide.

96
00:04:19,309 --> 00:04:21,834
Tilt your head back. Ah.

97
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:24,807
Dr. Freedman?

98
00:04:24,948 --> 00:04:26,540
What is it?

99
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,506
What's wrong?

100
00:04:33,089 --> 00:04:35,614
I need to ask you something
and I know what you're gonna say,

101
00:04:35,758 --> 00:04:38,955
so I don't want you to say anything,
at least not until you hear me out.

102
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,326
It's about Wyatt.

103
00:04:41,464 --> 00:04:43,728
- I need a favor.
- No. I'm not helping you get a date.

104
00:04:44,267 --> 00:04:46,394
No. Not for him, for my patient.

105
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,470
- His patient.
- Who I'm trying to help.

106
00:04:48,604 --> 00:04:50,504
But I can't. And you can.

107
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,835
- We have to close the doors.
- Cooper realizes Pacific Wellcare

108
00:04:53,977 --> 00:04:56,138
- is putting us out of business.
- No. Close the doors.

109
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:59,339
My patient has measles and was in
reception for half an hour, running around.

110
00:04:59,482 --> 00:05:02,474
Everyone that was out... All our patients
this morning have been exposed.

111
00:05:02,618 --> 00:05:04,210
Measles? My pregnant patients.

112
00:05:04,354 --> 00:05:05,821
- And the elderly.
- All at risk.

113
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,154
- We have to close the doors.
- We have to close the doors.

114
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,157
ADDISON:
I'm sorry for the inconvenience,

115
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,768
but the virus stays airborne
for up to four hours.

116
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,735
We need to make sure everyone
who was exposed has been immunized.

117
00:05:24,674 --> 00:05:27,234
Excuse me, can I get the shot now?

118
00:05:27,377 --> 00:05:28,537
I have a lunch at 12:30.

119
00:05:28,678 --> 00:05:31,841
I'm sorry. It contains a live virus.
It's not safe to take when you're pregnant,

120
00:05:31,981 --> 00:05:33,107
but if your blood comes back

121
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:36,013
and your antibodies are low,
then we can treat it with immunoglobulin.

122
00:05:36,152 --> 00:05:39,121
And if that doesn't work?
Doesn't measles lead to birth defects?

123
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,882
Let's not get ahead of ourselves, okay?

124
00:05:42,492 --> 00:05:44,687
We need to notify L.A. County Health.

125
00:05:44,827 --> 00:05:47,625
- They're gonna want a complete survey.
- And they are always awful.

126
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,129
As if we didn't have enough to do.

127
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:51,426
Okay, I have a light day,
you have to deal with this.

128
00:05:51,567 --> 00:05:54,695
I'll speak to the health department.
I'm in the mood for a fight.

129
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,568
ARLENE: Will's fine.
- So far.

130
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:01,268
But he hasn't been vaccinated
and he's at risk to get this.

131
00:06:02,045 --> 00:06:05,105
It's the measles. When my parents
were growing up, everyone got it.

132
00:06:05,248 --> 00:06:07,239
And hundreds of people
died from it every year.

133
00:06:07,383 --> 00:06:10,614
- The vaccine changed...
- Don't even think of suggesting...

134
00:06:10,753 --> 00:06:13,745
There's no proven link
between vaccinations and autism.

135
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,118
It's not just me.

136
00:06:15,258 --> 00:06:17,954
I have talked to dozens of parents.

137
00:06:18,594 --> 00:06:20,789
You vaccinated Jeffrey

138
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:24,127
and it was like a light
went out inside him.

139
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:26,167
And he's living in some parallel world.

140
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:28,532
- Arlene.
- You don't live with him.

141
00:06:28,905 --> 00:06:30,463
So don't ask me to risk Will too.

142
00:06:34,911 --> 00:06:38,972
Sweetie, here you go. Hey.
Hey, I can't get a hold of Betsey's mom.

143
00:06:39,115 --> 00:06:41,140
- I don't know if she's immunized.
- Most have been.

144
00:06:41,284 --> 00:06:43,149
You don't know her mother.
She forgot her.

145
00:06:43,286 --> 00:06:45,186
You think she remembered
doctor visits?

146
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:48,688
Should I just give her the shot to be sure?
She played with that kid for a half hour.

147
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,157
You have 24 hours to give the vaccine,
so wait for the mom

148
00:06:51,294 --> 00:06:53,455
and spare the needle if you can.

149
00:06:55,531 --> 00:06:58,967
Grab a chart. We're checking every
patient who was in here for immunization.

150
00:06:59,102 --> 00:07:00,763
SAM: How many are we looking at?
- Of what?

151
00:07:00,903 --> 00:07:03,804
These little time bombs.
Kids coming in without the vaccinations.

152
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,840
The vast majority of my practice
is pro-vaccine.

153
00:07:05,975 --> 00:07:08,637
Whether or not to vaccinate
should not even be open for debate.

154
00:07:08,778 --> 00:07:11,076
It isn't. I agree
with the Academy of American Pediatrics

155
00:07:11,214 --> 00:07:13,705
that we shouldn't abandon patients
who choose not to vaccinate.

156
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,647
PETE:
Cooper's right. We can't kick a kid out

157
00:07:15,785 --> 00:07:18,049
because the parents believe
in a theory about vaccines.

158
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,654
The CDC is clear.

159
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:22,383
Vaccines do not cause autism,
they save lives.

160
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:23,787
It's the end of story.

161
00:07:23,926 --> 00:07:26,690
DELL: Hey, I was just in the pediatric
waiting area with Betsey.

162
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:30,131
This is Michael's mom's.
And she left it in the lobby.

163
00:07:31,934 --> 00:07:33,561
So if she was down
at Pacific Wellcare...

164
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:34,761
Then her kids were too.

165
00:07:34,904 --> 00:07:37,031
Someone's gotta tell Charlotte.

166
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,315
Hi, I need to speak to Dr. King.

167
00:07:48,451 --> 00:07:49,975
It's important.

168
00:07:50,786 --> 00:07:52,686
- You're Dr. Freedman, right?
- Yeah.

169
00:07:52,822 --> 00:07:54,084
I'm Sheldon, Sheldon Wallace.

170
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:56,748
- Violet's friend.
- Right. Well, I hope so. I mean...

171
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,425
I'd like that, she's...

172
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,086
How is she? Violet?

173
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,664
- Exposed to the measles.
CHARLOTTE: Exposed to the measles?

174
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:06,495
A kid in our practice has the measles,
which is why I'm here.

175
00:08:06,636 --> 00:08:09,298
- This concerns me how?
- Well, you have this wonderful coffee bar

176
00:08:09,438 --> 00:08:10,871
that you advertise so prominently,

177
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,703
and a lot of our patients wander by
on their way upstairs.

178
00:08:13,843 --> 00:08:16,403
- It is good coffee.
- You've exposed my entire practice

179
00:08:16,546 --> 00:08:18,241
to the measles?

180
00:08:22,151 --> 00:08:23,743
WYATT:
Claudia Jenkins needs a surgeon.

181
00:08:23,886 --> 00:08:26,354
A surgeon with a background
in both gynecology and fertility.

182
00:08:26,489 --> 00:08:28,753
Someone who can implant
the ovarian tissue

183
00:08:28,891 --> 00:08:32,190
close enough to the uterine blood supply
to allow her to produce her own eggs.

184
00:08:32,328 --> 00:08:34,353
Naomi was right. You want a miracle.

185
00:08:34,497 --> 00:08:35,862
No. I want you.

186
00:08:36,532 --> 00:08:37,726
Just as a surgeon.

187
00:08:37,867 --> 00:08:40,734
You perform the procedure
at St. Ambrose, neutral territory.

188
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,065
You bill all you want.
Naomi and I do the follow-up.

189
00:08:43,206 --> 00:08:46,471
You just go in and cut and implant,
and you're done.

190
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:49,601
Claudia gets a baby.
You're not tainted by working with me.

191
00:08:49,745 --> 00:08:51,576
Take a look.

192
00:08:52,682 --> 00:08:55,082
Tell me that this surgery
wouldn't be amazing.

193
00:08:56,352 --> 00:08:57,944
You don't get me at all.

194
00:08:58,087 --> 00:08:59,714
You think all I wanna do is cut?

195
00:09:00,756 --> 00:09:03,782
If I do a surgery, I do the follow-up.

196
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,457
I make sure it takes.

197
00:09:05,595 --> 00:09:08,291
I see the pregnancy
the whole way through.

198
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:11,127
Now, you may just look
at procedures and outcomes,

199
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:14,327
but my patients get me
for the whole process.

200
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,767
Well, that would be even better.

201
00:09:17,907 --> 00:09:20,603
Read the file, Dr. Montgomery.

202
00:09:21,177 --> 00:09:23,111
Before you say no.

203
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:42,563
Are you still having sex
with the same guy?

204
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,131
With the same guy, huh?

205
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,596
Gonna tell me with who?

206
00:09:48,738 --> 00:09:51,206
I told you whom it was
and you didn't believe me.

207
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,705
Who it was, and you told me Pete.

208
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,810
Which is obfuscation. Lying, really.

209
00:09:54,944 --> 00:09:56,206
It's Pete, Cooper.

210
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,170
I'm having sex with Pete.

211
00:09:59,882 --> 00:10:01,110
You need me to prove it to you?

212
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,617
Lift your shirt.

213
00:10:10,226 --> 00:10:12,126
- Excuse me?
- I need you to lift up your shirt.

214
00:10:12,261 --> 00:10:15,059
- Trust me. I'm a doctor.
- A pediatrician. That's like half a doctor.

215
00:10:15,598 --> 00:10:19,193
- Lift.
- This isn't one of your weird...

216
00:10:20,569 --> 00:10:22,196
COOPER:
There's a tattoo.

217
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:23,831
You're sleeping with Violet?

218
00:10:23,973 --> 00:10:26,032
Do you have to sleep with everybody?

219
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:29,406
- I don't sleep with everybody, and l...
- You sleep with people and they leave.

220
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:32,036
- You want Violet to leave the practice?
VIOLET: I'm not gonna leave.

221
00:10:32,181 --> 00:10:33,705
- You told him?
- It's just sex.

222
00:10:33,849 --> 00:10:36,147
Oh, no, you're not capable
of just having sex.

223
00:10:36,285 --> 00:10:39,482
You are a relationship junkie.
And Pete is the anti-relationship.

224
00:10:39,622 --> 00:10:41,852
Pete is the ruiner of relationships.

225
00:10:41,991 --> 00:10:43,253
- Pete is...
- Is right here.

226
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:46,054
- And you know it's true.
- Isn't that, like, the proverbial pot

227
00:10:46,195 --> 00:10:48,629
- calling the kettle...
- Cooper, Cooper, Cooper.

228
00:10:48,764 --> 00:10:50,095
I'm fine.

229
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,859
We're fine.

230
00:10:52,335 --> 00:10:54,701
There's nothing to worry about.

231
00:10:57,373 --> 00:10:59,705
Claudia Jenkins could have a baby.

232
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,601
Thank you, Addison.

233
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,577
- There's one condition.
- Yes.

234
00:11:05,715 --> 00:11:06,909
This is a one time thing.

235
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:10,177
We help Claudia,
and then you are done working with Wyatt.

236
00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:11,786
You're blackmailing me.

237
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:15,288
No, no. It's not blackmail. It's extortion.
I'm doing this for your own good, Nai.

238
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,949
What, so that I don't become corrupted
and evil like him?

239
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:21,325
So I don't extort promises
from my friends?

240
00:11:21,464 --> 00:11:22,795
Do you want me to do the surgery?

241
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,928
I guess I have no choice.

242
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,465
Okay, so that's it.
Everybody's been immunized.

243
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,577
Everybody that was here
has been contacted.

244
00:11:35,711 --> 00:11:37,906
You can re-file
all these immunization records...

245
00:11:38,047 --> 00:11:39,947
SONIA:
Oh, no, he can't.

246
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,107
Sonya Nichols.
County Health Department.

247
00:11:42,251 --> 00:11:43,718
I'm gonna need those.

248
00:11:43,853 --> 00:11:45,787
Oh, Sam Bennett. I called you.

249
00:11:48,224 --> 00:11:51,785
- Are those all the immunization records?
- Yeah. Yeah, this is everything.

250
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:55,821
Okay. I want the vaccination records
of all the patients in your practice,

251
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:59,401
and then after I interview all personnel
and review their employment certificates,

252
00:11:59,535 --> 00:12:02,060
I'll need to inspect
your isolation facilities.

253
00:12:02,204 --> 00:12:05,002
Well, we don't have isolation facilities,
per se.

254
00:12:06,275 --> 00:12:09,608
But... Well, wait, we provide for rooms,
we just don't...

255
00:12:09,745 --> 00:12:11,576
And not up to current guidelines?

256
00:12:11,714 --> 00:12:14,410
Or are you aware of the recent changes
in the standards?

257
00:12:18,788 --> 00:12:21,689
This isn't gonna be very much fun, is it?

258
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,724
You wanna show me around?

259
00:12:24,427 --> 00:12:26,657
Yeah, right this way.

260
00:12:30,466 --> 00:12:32,866
His fever, it was a 104

261
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,867
by the time I got home.
I couldn't get it down.

262
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:38,303
- How you feeling, Michael?
- I'm really cold. And my stomach hurts.

263
00:12:38,441 --> 00:12:39,635
He vomited twice.

264
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,476
His lungs are congested.

265
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:42,634
[COUGHING]

266
00:12:42,778 --> 00:12:45,838
COOPER: Okay, okay.
Okay, we've got you. It's okay.

267
00:12:45,981 --> 00:12:48,814
We're gonna get fluids and bring
that fever down, you'll feel better.

268
00:12:48,951 --> 00:12:50,919
I need a nasal cannula at two liters.

269
00:12:51,053 --> 00:12:53,886
Chest x-rays and cultures times two.

270
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,856
I don't understand. Why is he so sick?

271
00:12:57,393 --> 00:12:59,361
Arlene. Measles is serious.

272
00:12:59,495 --> 00:13:03,192
It can lead to pneumonia, encephalitis,
all sorts of other complications.

273
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,893
You notify Ped's ICU.
We need an isolation room.

274
00:13:23,953 --> 00:13:26,114
Michael's resting now,
and his fever's down.

275
00:13:26,255 --> 00:13:28,246
But he's still having trouble breathing.

276
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:34,056
My husband is still in Switzerland.
You don't think he needs to fly back?

277
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,097
If it was my son, I'd come.

278
00:13:41,504 --> 00:13:43,369
Arlene, we need to talk about Will.

279
00:13:43,506 --> 00:13:45,838
L... No. I told you no.

280
00:13:46,108 --> 00:13:47,166
No vaccinations.

281
00:13:49,311 --> 00:13:50,869
I don't think you can risk putting Will

282
00:13:51,013 --> 00:13:53,140
- through what Michael's going through.
- I can't risk

283
00:13:53,282 --> 00:13:55,512
putting Will through
what Jeffrey's gone through.

284
00:13:55,651 --> 00:13:56,743
I lost one child to autism.

285
00:13:56,886 --> 00:13:58,410
I can't lose another.

286
00:13:58,554 --> 00:14:00,545
- Arlene, you won't...
- Look, don't you think,

287
00:14:00,689 --> 00:14:02,554
seeing Michael in there like that...

288
00:14:06,028 --> 00:14:08,394
I would do anything for my kids.

289
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:10,631
I can't.

290
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,360
Look at him.
Don't you remember when he was 2?

291
00:14:14,904 --> 00:14:16,804
That smile?

292
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,767
He'd light up the room.

293
00:14:18,908 --> 00:14:23,140
And then you vaccinated him
and that kid vanished.

294
00:14:23,412 --> 00:14:26,313
Those vaccines took him away.

295
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:27,642
I don't care what you know.

296
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:30,949
I know what I know.

297
00:14:31,086 --> 00:14:33,213
I know what I lost.

298
00:14:33,355 --> 00:14:35,255
I can't risk it again.

299
00:14:39,695 --> 00:14:41,390
I can't believe
this health department lady

300
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,794
- is making us jump through these hoops.
- It's horrible.

301
00:14:43,933 --> 00:14:45,901
How's Michael?

302
00:14:46,068 --> 00:14:48,559
Not good. And Arlene
still won't let me vaccinate Will.

303
00:14:48,704 --> 00:14:49,932
Call Family Services.

304
00:14:50,072 --> 00:14:52,006
- You're serious?
- Yes. It's child abuse.

305
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,837
She's knowingly putting her son at risk
for getting really sick.

306
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,842
- Irresponsible.
- It's a parent's decision.

307
00:14:56,979 --> 00:15:00,176
DELL: Okay, well, if I find out that Heather
didn't vaccinate Betsey, I'll report her.

308
00:15:01,116 --> 00:15:02,777
Can I see you a moment, Dr. Bennett?

309
00:15:05,421 --> 00:15:07,616
- Perfect.
- That can't be good.

310
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,150
Sam's right. I've gotta call.

311
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:12,692
Calling DCFS while her other child
is still in the hospital would just be cruel.

312
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:15,058
COOPER: Cruel?
Putting another child in danger is cruel.

313
00:15:15,197 --> 00:15:16,994
Exposing the city to measles is cruel.

314
00:15:17,132 --> 00:15:19,760
PETE: Violet's right, you can't fault
the mother because she chose not...

315
00:15:19,902 --> 00:15:22,598
Of course you're gonna agree with Violet.
You're sleeping with her.

316
00:15:29,878 --> 00:15:31,607
I agree with her because she's right.

317
00:15:31,747 --> 00:15:34,477
I'm sleeping with her because it's part
of the fun of being an adult.

318
00:15:34,617 --> 00:15:37,051
We can do whatever we want,
with whomever we want,

319
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,211
however much we want.

320
00:15:39,622 --> 00:15:44,252
So if everyone would just relax,
and let us be adults about this.

321
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,358
We need to go over protocol.

322
00:15:53,502 --> 00:15:58,166
How did you dispose of the contaminated
exam items used on the sick boy?

323
00:15:58,307 --> 00:16:01,299
Tongue depressors, gloves,
thermometer cover?

324
00:16:01,443 --> 00:16:03,468
We use a medical waste company.

325
00:16:03,612 --> 00:16:07,173
Needle sticks,
did you follow CDC-approved guidelines?

326
00:16:07,316 --> 00:16:10,046
I assume so. I can check but...

327
00:16:10,185 --> 00:16:12,517
And what kind of ventilation system
do you have?

328
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:15,913
You'd be amazed how many practices
don't have a laminar flow room.

329
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:19,050
Right. Yes. Laminar flow is good.

330
00:16:19,862 --> 00:16:21,329
You don't know what that is, do you?

331
00:16:22,431 --> 00:16:26,197
Dr. Nichols, look, I've spent hours
jumping through hoops for you...

332
00:16:26,335 --> 00:16:28,565
You shouldn't have to.
It should all be standard.

333
00:16:28,704 --> 00:16:31,639
It should all be covered
in your procedures and policy manual,

334
00:16:31,774 --> 00:16:34,106
which it's required by law you have.

335
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:35,668
So I can see it?

336
00:16:36,612 --> 00:16:39,740
You wanna see our procedures
and policy manual?

337
00:16:40,182 --> 00:16:41,706

and moved all our files.

- Violet.

Of course I want you to be happy.

- No. No.

ultimately leads.

ADDISON: All right, we're done. Wyatt,
shut your mouth while I save her life.

503
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:11,814
- It won't pass, his throat's too swollen.
- Get the fiber-optic scope, now.

504
00:26:11,953 --> 00:26:13,648
We've got to ventilate him.

505
00:26:15,857 --> 00:26:18,052
Heart rate is dropping.
SATs are bottoming out.

506
00:26:18,193 --> 00:26:20,286
COOPER: Where's the damn scope?
- It's coming, Cooper.

507
00:26:20,428 --> 00:26:21,793
[BEEPING]

508
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:23,727
Open up a surgical tray,
I'm gonna crike him.

509
00:26:23,865 --> 00:26:26,493
- Hold this.
- What is that? What are you gonna do?

510
00:26:26,635 --> 00:26:28,262
Just wait, Cooper. The scope's coming.

511
00:26:29,271 --> 00:26:31,603
COOPER: His heart rate's 40,
I'm doing this. Betadine.

512
00:26:33,575 --> 00:26:36,135
COOPER: Oh, God.
CHARLOTTE: Wait. Wait!

513
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,349
Slowly.

514
00:26:43,485 --> 00:26:46,215
- Easy does it.
- Almost there, almost there.

515
00:26:46,788 --> 00:26:48,119
I got it.

516
00:26:57,399 --> 00:26:58,798
- Sounds good.
- He's gonna be okay?

517
00:27:06,941 --> 00:27:10,536
Set the vent at an FI,
0.2 of a hundred, rate of 24.

518
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,873
I need a minute.

519
00:27:17,752 --> 00:27:19,913
Hey, I'll watch him for a minute.

520
00:27:21,323 --> 00:27:24,315
Hey, young man.
Come here for a sec.

521
00:27:26,961 --> 00:27:28,223
Sit down.

522
00:27:30,999 --> 00:27:32,830
ARLENE: Get the hell away from my son.
- Mommy.

523
00:27:32,967 --> 00:27:34,867
- You have to stop.
- Your son is dying there.

524
00:27:35,003 --> 00:27:37,028
ARLENE: Get the hell away from me.
CHARLOTTE: Mrs. Perkins.

525
00:27:37,172 --> 00:27:39,470
- No!
COOPER: Good.

526
00:27:51,386 --> 00:27:52,546
Will,

527
00:27:52,687 --> 00:27:54,211
are you okay?

528
00:27:54,356 --> 00:27:55,846
The vaccine is safe.

529
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,514
You don't know.

530
00:27:57,892 --> 00:28:00,087
- It is.
- Look at him and tell me it is.

531
00:28:00,228 --> 00:28:01,695
Vaccines are the standard of care.

532
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:04,628
Dr. Freedman did something
that was medically necessary.

533
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,257
He assaulted my son

534
00:28:07,402 --> 00:28:08,699
and I'm gonna sue this hospital,

535
00:28:08,837 --> 00:28:12,102
so help me,
if something happens to him.

536
00:28:13,174 --> 00:28:14,698
I did what I felt I had to.

537
00:28:14,843 --> 00:28:17,778
It wasn't yours to do.

538
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:23,076
It wasn't yours to do.

539
00:28:23,218 --> 00:28:25,186
WOMAN [ON PA]:
<i>Code blue in CICU.</i>

540
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,483
<i>Code blue in CICU.</i>

541
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:35,323
I went under thinking about the crib
in the yellow room.

542
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:39,094
- I wish we could have done more.
- I know I should just be grateful

543
00:28:39,234 --> 00:28:40,394
for being alive.

544
00:28:40,535 --> 00:28:42,059
We all wanted to help you.

545
00:28:42,203 --> 00:28:45,229
And I'm not giving up, Claudia.

546
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,609
I'll be back later, okay?

547
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,272
Would you go over postop
instructions with Claudia?

548
00:28:52,414 --> 00:28:54,507
I'll be right back.

549
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:59,350
- What was that about?
- About my embarrassment

550
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:02,081
- for picking the wrong person for the job.
- You're blaming me?

551
00:29:02,223 --> 00:29:04,248
The chemo ravaged her entire body.

552
00:29:04,392 --> 00:29:07,555
There weren't 2 square centimeters of
healthy tissue that could've held a suture

553
00:29:07,695 --> 00:29:10,459
- let alone an implant.
- You talk like you searched exhaustively.

554
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:13,164
- What are you talking about?
- You didn't push.

555
00:29:13,301 --> 00:29:16,395
I agreed to do a totally
experimental procedure that going in

556
00:29:16,538 --> 00:29:17,869
we all knew was a long shot.

557
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,871
And when I felt the risks
to the patient's life

558
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,977
outweighed the potential for success,
I chose to save the patient.

559
00:29:23,111 --> 00:29:26,171
You had time. You could've controlled
the bleeding and implanted the tissue.

560
00:29:26,314 --> 00:29:28,782
You hate me, you didn't wanna be told
what to do. You stopped.

561
00:29:28,917 --> 00:29:30,544
You wanted to prove
that you knew better.

562
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:33,085
I'm no surgeon,
but I think there was time.

563
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:36,881
Well, I'm sorry if what happened in there
didn't produce the result

564
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:39,323
that you wanted for some study,
but I made the right call.

565
00:29:39,761 --> 00:29:41,626
You really believe that?

566
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,868
- Dr. Bennett.
- I got it. I got it.

567
00:29:54,008 --> 00:29:57,637
Okay. Everything is in here.

568
00:29:57,779 --> 00:30:00,577
All right,
protocols for workspace contamination.

569
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,740
Follow-ups with patients
with positive labs.

570
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:06,547
Blood draw procedures
that include responses to needle sticks.

571
00:30:06,688 --> 00:30:08,349
Okay.

572
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:10,785
Wait, that's it?

573
00:30:10,925 --> 00:30:14,383
You're not gonna read it and ask me about
our policies on work-related injuries, or...?

574
00:30:14,529 --> 00:30:16,190
I'm sure you did a very thorough job.

575
00:30:17,699 --> 00:30:20,031
You knew that I wouldn't be able
to find it.

576
00:30:20,168 --> 00:30:23,296
And you knew that I would kill myself
trying to come up with it.

577
00:30:23,438 --> 00:30:25,770
Well, by law,
your office needed to have that.

578
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,034
- Now you do.
- You enjoy this, don't you?

579
00:30:28,176 --> 00:30:31,168
The power.
Coming in here, pushing me around.

580
00:30:31,312 --> 00:30:33,507
L... That's not true at all.

581
00:30:33,648 --> 00:30:35,445
I've been nothing but professional.

582
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:39,610
You've been a bully.
You just can't stand real doctors, can you?

583
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,927
Do you

584
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:52,225
know what it's like to have everyone
hate you before they even meet you?

585
00:30:52,367 --> 00:30:56,360
To walk in the door and have everyone
assume that you're awful?

586
00:30:56,504 --> 00:30:59,996
I don't know what some evil public servant
did to you in a past life,

587
00:31:00,141 --> 00:31:01,403
but I'm here to do a job.

588
00:31:01,543 --> 00:31:03,238
A job I think is important.

589
00:31:03,378 --> 00:31:06,108
If there were a serious outbreak here,
you'd want someone like me

590
00:31:06,247 --> 00:31:08,772
because I am a real doctor

591
00:31:09,183 --> 00:31:12,414
who chose this job to help people.

592
00:31:14,756 --> 00:31:17,748
All right, well, maybe I was wrong.

593
00:31:18,259 --> 00:31:21,251
But for the past two days,
you haven't even looked me in the eye,

594
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:26,797
or even acknowledged
that I'm a human being.

595
00:31:26,935 --> 00:31:28,163
What is your problem?

596
00:31:32,607 --> 00:31:35,337
For two days I've been thinking
your lips would taste like chocolate,

597
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:36,943
and I couldn't look at them.

598
00:31:38,179 --> 00:31:41,478
I'm really sorry that I misjudged you.

599
00:31:47,255 --> 00:31:49,450
Do you believe
that people can change?

600
00:31:49,591 --> 00:31:53,220
Ugh! Look, if one more person butts in
and tries to tell me what Pete is,

601
00:31:53,361 --> 00:31:55,659
- and what we should be doing...
- Wow.

602
00:31:55,797 --> 00:31:57,196
I was talking about Heather.

603
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,467
Oh. Okay. So you and Heather.

604
00:32:03,271 --> 00:32:05,000
Okay, well, Heather says

605
00:32:05,139 --> 00:32:08,370
that she's not the person
that she used to be.

606
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:12,605
And that by taking custody of Betsey,
I'm punishing her for her past.

607
00:32:12,747 --> 00:32:15,147
- Are you?
- I just don't know if I can believe it.

608
00:32:15,483 --> 00:32:16,780
That she's different now.

609
00:32:16,918 --> 00:32:18,545
VIOLET:
Well, you have to protect your daughter.

610
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:19,846
DELL:
Right.

611
00:32:19,988 --> 00:32:22,786
But if you're asking me
if I think people can change,

612
00:32:22,924 --> 00:32:25,290
if I didn't believe that,
I couldn't do what I do.

613
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:29,489
When you look at Betsey and Heather,

614
00:32:29,631 --> 00:32:32,065
and you take away what you want,

615
00:32:33,568 --> 00:32:34,830
what's best for your daughter?

616
00:32:48,416 --> 00:32:49,781
What?

617
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,653
I don't think it's ridiculous.

618
00:32:55,289 --> 00:32:58,918
The idea that you and me

619
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,355
that we could be more than sex.

620
00:33:05,633 --> 00:33:06,725
Pete...

621
00:33:06,868 --> 00:33:08,768
Don't think
about what Cooper would say,

622
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:12,168
or Sam or Naomi or anybody.
Just think about

623
00:33:13,941 --> 00:33:15,101
what you think.

624
00:33:16,144 --> 00:33:18,442
Why does it have to be a crazy idea?

625
00:33:21,983 --> 00:33:25,009
- Asystole. I can't find a pulse.
- Resuming CPR.

626
00:33:25,153 --> 00:33:27,621
- Another round of epi.
- Cooper, you've done everything.

627
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:31,156
- It's been over a half hour.
- Where's the atropine? Come on!

628
00:33:31,626 --> 00:33:33,491
- It's time to call it.
- I'm running the code.

629
00:33:33,628 --> 00:33:35,357
I decide when we're done.

630
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:42,531
Please don't stop.

00:34:03,991 --> 00:34:05,891
Time of death, 3:37.

Michael.

633
00:34:27,181 --> 00:34:29,149
He just learned to tie his shoes.

634
00:34:30,284 --> 00:34:31,410
He can't be gone.

635
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:35,281
Not like this.

636
00:34:35,957 --> 00:34:38,084
Oh, Michael.

[CRYING]

638
00:34:45,233 --> 00:34:47,929
Oh, Michael.

639
00:35:03,151 --> 00:35:04,743
I thought

640
00:35:07,388 --> 00:35:10,482
it was gonna be like a cold.

641
00:35:15,329 --> 00:35:17,320
I was trying to protect him.

642
00:36:12,286 --> 00:36:14,516
You did everything you could.

643
00:36:32,473 --> 00:36:35,169
- What are you doing in here?
- I was thinking about the two doctors

644
00:36:35,309 --> 00:36:37,402
that came before Addison.

645
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:39,771
About you.

646
00:36:40,681 --> 00:36:41,739
And them leaving.

647
00:36:43,718 --> 00:36:44,980
People can change, Violet.

648
00:36:45,686 --> 00:36:48,154
- Isn't that what you told Dell?
- Yes.

649
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,189
You can change.

650
00:36:50,324 --> 00:36:52,622
I don't know if I can change
what I know about you.

651
00:36:53,895 --> 00:36:56,261
- How I look at you.
- What about what you feel?

652
00:36:56,397 --> 00:36:57,864
Well, I can't separate that out.

653
00:36:57,999 --> 00:37:00,331
What I feel is a combination
of all of those things.

654
00:37:01,235 --> 00:37:02,725
And I can't help it.

655
00:37:03,871 --> 00:37:05,498
Look what happened
between you and Meg.

656
00:37:06,774 --> 00:37:09,504
I screwed that up, but it was wrong
before I screwed it up.

657
00:37:11,746 --> 00:37:13,941
I like what we have, Pete.

658
00:37:14,081 --> 00:37:15,275
I mean,

659
00:37:15,416 --> 00:37:17,748
I love what we have.

660
00:37:17,885 --> 00:37:19,477
But I don't

661
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,747
want it to be more.

662
00:37:25,192 --> 00:37:27,092
Wouldn't that be a good thing?

663
00:37:27,228 --> 00:37:28,991
What we have

more?

I don't know.

What are you doing here?

668
00:37:51,919 --> 00:37:54,149
Come to get evidence?

There's no needles, Dell. No booze.

00:37:58,426 --> 00:38:00,986
- Hey, beautiful.
- Hi, Daddy.

671
00:38:03,931 --> 00:38:05,455
I came to apologize.

00:38:06,634 --> 00:38:07,726
Look,

673
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:09,665
you were right, okay?

674
00:38:09,804 --> 00:38:12,967
I should have called and I should
have been more responsible

675
00:38:13,107 --> 00:38:14,836
- about the vaccine.
- Not about that.

676
00:38:16,077 --> 00:38:18,841
For getting you started.

677
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,675
Addicted.

678
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:24,651
I should have kept you away
from my friends back then.

679
00:38:25,586 --> 00:38:26,883
I'm sorry, Heather.

680
00:38:32,927 --> 00:38:35,361
Well, I'm doing better now.

681
00:38:35,496 --> 00:38:36,827
You know, we're doing better.

682
00:38:36,964 --> 00:38:38,363
DELL:
I know.

683
00:38:38,499 --> 00:38:39,796
I can see.

684
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,901
But I need more time with her.

685
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:47,200
- Something more permanent.
- Dell.

686
00:38:47,341 --> 00:38:50,674
Maybe we can work it out.

687
00:38:50,811 --> 00:38:52,335
You and me.

688
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,141
Without court.

689
00:38:54,281 --> 00:38:55,748
Okay?

690
00:38:57,852 --> 00:38:59,649
I just...

691
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,017
I need to know she's safe.

692
00:39:21,709 --> 00:39:25,577
Apparently I'm a misogynistic,
manipulative son of a bitch.

693
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,439
And ungrateful.

694
00:39:28,582 --> 00:39:30,743
You agreed to do something
you didn't wanna do,

695
00:39:30,885 --> 00:39:33,183
and I should have been more gracious.

696
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,287
- Are you protecting my honor?
- I don't like bullies.

697
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:46,125
Maybe he was right.

698
00:39:46,667 --> 00:39:50,467
Oh, I hate him.
I hate his arrogance and his pushing and...

[SIGHS]

700
00:39:52,339 --> 00:39:55,399
If Claudia was my patient,
maybe I'd have done the same thing.

701
00:39:55,543 --> 00:39:57,636
- Pushed to make it work.
- Addison,

702
00:39:57,778 --> 00:39:58,938
you saved her life.

703
00:40:02,783 --> 00:40:04,307
Look,

00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:08,178
if you wanna work with Wyatt again,
work with Wyatt again.

705
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:10,017
Don't not do it because of what I say.

706
00:40:10,624 --> 00:40:12,922
- You comfortable with that?
- No, I'm not comfortable

707
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:17,087
thinking that my advice colors
what you say or, you know, what you do.

708
00:40:18,299 --> 00:40:20,529
Hate him for yourself. Or not.

709
00:40:23,471 --> 00:40:25,939
You wanna go get a drink?
I could use one.

710
00:40:26,073 --> 00:40:28,803
No. I am going to take my own advice

711
00:40:28,943 --> 00:40:31,912
and decide something for myself.

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

713
00:40:33,948 --> 00:40:35,415
Come on in.

714
00:40:36,617 --> 00:40:39,211
I wanted to finish the conversation.

715
00:40:39,954 --> 00:40:41,717
From the elevator.

716
00:40:44,725 --> 00:40:47,489
I meant what I said, Violet. I like you.

717
00:40:47,628 --> 00:40:48,993
And I'd like for us to be friends.

718
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:51,963
And I'm not exactly sure
how one goes about doing that

719
00:40:52,099 --> 00:40:54,727
because I'd like to get to know you better.
Not go out on a date,

720
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:57,565
but just go out as friends.

721
00:40:58,339 --> 00:41:02,503
And without all that pressure of sex

722
00:41:02,643 --> 00:41:04,770
and dating and...

00:41:05,179 --> 00:41:06,612
I just...

724
00:41:08,649 --> 00:41:10,014
I think we'd be good friends.

725
00:41:14,855 --> 00:41:16,720
I think you're right.

00:41:57,331 --> 00:41:59,799
Hey, Kevin.

It's me.

00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:04,128
Yeah, I...

I miss you.
