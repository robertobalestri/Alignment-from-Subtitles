He just stopped at 4?

genetic, could be anything.

00:08:44,473 --> 00:08:46,236
My daughter was attacked.

170
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:47,535
By a man.

171
00:08:47,843 --> 00:08:48,969
Oh.

172
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,743
I'm so sorry.

173
00:08:53,015 --> 00:08:55,643
- When did this happen?
- A few months ago.

174
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:59,050
And, uh, this is something
that you reported?

175
00:08:59,188 --> 00:09:00,780
No, that's not what I want.

176
00:09:00,923 --> 00:09:03,289
It is not something we'd do.

177
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:05,322
If you were raped,

178
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:09,295
Sharbat, you really should speak
to someone. We have a psychiatrist here...

179
00:09:09,432 --> 00:09:12,060
- That's not why I came here.
- Okay.

180
00:09:12,935 --> 00:09:16,496
Are you still feeling pain
from the attack?

181
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,901
There is no pain.

182
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:21,902
- Oh.
- No. Please.

183
00:09:23,713 --> 00:09:27,342
I need you to make me a virgin again.

184
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,758
You can make her virgin again.

185
00:09:41,097 --> 00:09:42,359
I know it's possible.

186
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,523
In our culture, sometimes it is done.

187
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,227
You're talking about hymenoplasty.

188
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,270
That's not something to be done lightly.

189
00:09:49,405 --> 00:09:53,000
It is a real surgery.
With real potential complications.

190
00:09:53,142 --> 00:09:56,600
And as much as we can repair
the hymen,

191
00:09:57,313 --> 00:09:58,974
it doesn't make you a virgin.

192
00:09:59,115 --> 00:10:01,140
I am engaged to a man in Afghanistan.

193
00:10:01,284 --> 00:10:03,343
He will take me and my parents
back to our country.

194
00:10:03,486 --> 00:10:06,455
Where we will be married.
Where he will take care of us.

195
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:08,819
And he doesn't know
about what happened to you?

196
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:11,356
I have not met him yet.

197
00:10:11,494 --> 00:10:12,961
AMINA:
He can't know.

198
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:16,321
Her status, it is checked.

199
00:10:16,465 --> 00:10:19,366
And Islamic law
says sex before marriage is not allowed.

200
00:10:19,502 --> 00:10:21,663
- We would be disgraced.
ADDISON: I understand.

201
00:10:21,804 --> 00:10:23,101
But do you understand

202
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:24,900
that what happened to you,

203
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,167
is not your fault?

204
00:10:26,409 --> 00:10:28,104
I need to be pure.

205
00:10:28,244 --> 00:10:29,336
Can you help me?

206
00:10:31,614 --> 00:10:34,640
- Coop, do you think maybe we should...
- Sorry, man. A little later.

207
00:10:34,784 --> 00:10:37,514
Okay, this afternoon then.
I just need a couple minutes. Thanks.

208
00:10:37,653 --> 00:10:39,348
His vote is spoken for. It's for Naomi.

209
00:10:39,488 --> 00:10:42,286
Wait, nothing's decided
until election day, Violet.

210
00:10:42,425 --> 00:10:45,588
This is a campaign about ideas.
You hear me? L...

211
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,525
- Lost cause.
- No.

212
00:10:47,663 --> 00:10:49,290
Nobody's a lost cause.

213
00:10:49,432 --> 00:10:51,491
Except for maybe Dell.
Dell's a red state.

214
00:10:51,634 --> 00:10:54,603
- I'm not getting involved.
- Well, I did give him his job back.

215
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:58,798
But he and Nai, it's gonna be hard
to get over what they had.

216
00:10:58,941 --> 00:11:00,272
I'm not getting involved.

217
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:03,105
You know, he quit because of her.
Should I remind him of that?

218
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:06,681
- I thought you said it was gonna be civil.
- So civilly, I'll remind him

219
00:11:06,816 --> 00:11:07,874
of how bad it was.

220
00:11:13,723 --> 00:11:16,817
Bad timing, Coop.
The board's got a couple of bigwigs in,

221
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,157
and if I get one more complaint
about how many surgeries I should be...

222
00:11:21,297 --> 00:11:23,060
- I am not in the mood.
- My day's worse.

223
00:11:23,199 --> 00:11:26,600
I don't feel like having sex ever again.

224
00:11:27,403 --> 00:11:30,566
- Then what are you doing here?
- I came to talk.

225
00:11:36,412 --> 00:11:38,607
You wanted to talk. You're not talking.

226
00:11:38,748 --> 00:11:40,978
Do you think I'm a pervert?

227
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,112
- I am too busy for this.
- Hey, does this not bother you?

228
00:11:44,253 --> 00:11:47,051
We're both in the middle of tough days,
we can't even discuss it?

229
00:11:47,189 --> 00:11:49,282
I don't wanna discuss it.
I wanna get through it.

230
00:11:49,425 --> 00:11:53,191
That's the difference between you and me.
I don't know how to get through mine.

231
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,521
- What happened?
- A patient's mother

232
00:11:55,664 --> 00:11:58,428
recognized me from an adult website.

233
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,398
She does not want me
to treat her son.

234
00:12:01,537 --> 00:12:03,129
- That's absurd.
- You don't worry?

235
00:12:03,272 --> 00:12:07,140
- Patient recognizing you from private life?
- One has nothing to do with the other.

236
00:12:07,276 --> 00:12:08,504
Besides, I took mine down.

237
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:12,274
You didn't?

238
00:12:13,282 --> 00:12:16,183
How many sites are you on, Coop?
Two?

239
00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:17,852
Five?

240
00:12:18,721 --> 00:12:20,586
- Ten?
- Ish.

241
00:12:20,723 --> 00:12:22,281
Your patient might be right.

242
00:12:22,425 --> 00:12:24,757
There is something wrong with you.

243
00:12:26,896 --> 00:12:28,659
I'm a good doctor.

244
00:12:28,798 --> 00:12:30,925
I wanna help this kid.

245
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:34,135
She wants to be re-virginized?

246
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,635
Essentially, yes.

247
00:12:35,771 --> 00:12:39,070
But I just can't see sewing her back up,
it just feels wrong.

248
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:40,300
Okay, so wait a minute.

249
00:12:40,443 --> 00:12:42,308
You're going to deprive this girl

250
00:12:42,445 --> 00:12:45,175
of the life that she wants
because you have issues with it?

251
00:12:45,314 --> 00:12:47,339
She's a victim,
and you're not gonna help her?

252
00:12:47,483 --> 00:12:50,213
I just feel like I am colluding
with the whole system.

253
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:53,116
- Well, you are. You have to tell her no.
- On what grounds?

254
00:12:53,255 --> 00:12:55,348
Legal, moral, humanitarian.

255
00:12:55,491 --> 00:12:58,051
What did you get in ethics?
The test is beneficence and autonomy.

256
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:02,130
What is beneficent about helping
a young girl indulge a chauvinist fantasy

257
00:13:02,264 --> 00:13:03,595
by sewing up her vagina?

258
00:13:03,732 --> 00:13:06,223
But the question's not whether
the doctor thinks it's right.

259
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:07,960
It's whether the patient does.

260
00:13:09,605 --> 00:13:11,505
VIOLET:
She should really talk to someone.

261
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,403
I already asked. She's not interested.

262
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,567
- She wouldn't call the police.
- Call the police?

263
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,736
PETE: Addison has a patient
who wants to be re-virginized.

264
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,643
So she can marry a man
whom she's never met.

265
00:13:19,782 --> 00:13:22,046
- And that's against the law?
- She was raped, Sam.

266
00:13:22,651 --> 00:13:24,812
Oh. Well, that's awful.

267
00:13:24,954 --> 00:13:27,149
Yeah, it's awful.
But if Addison does this,

268
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:30,190
and the girl goes back to Kabul
to marry a man she doesn't know

269
00:13:30,326 --> 00:13:32,556
who'll only have her
if her hymen is untouched?

270
00:13:32,695 --> 00:13:34,925
That's wrong.
It's like violating her twice.

271
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:38,261
- Yeah, but it's her choice, isn't it?
WOMAN: Choice?

272
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,597
That girl will likely live
under a veil in a clay hut,

273
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:44,968
in a country where she could be stoned
for listening to a Madonna album.

274
00:13:45,107 --> 00:13:47,268
You think she understands
she's choosing that?

275
00:13:49,144 --> 00:13:50,406
Meg?

276
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,007
Hello, Peter.

277
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:12,394
- Meg?
- Meg?

278
00:14:12,535 --> 00:14:13,593
He ever mention her?

279
00:14:13,736 --> 00:14:15,863
If you vote for me,
I promise to tell you everything.

280
00:14:16,005 --> 00:14:17,063
- Sam.
- I'm just kidding.

281
00:14:17,206 --> 00:14:18,298
Who is she? She was, uh...

282
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,874
She was something.

283
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,978
[GASPING THEN CHUCKLING]

284
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,410
Where do you think
he knows her from?

285
00:14:29,852 --> 00:14:31,513
Addison?

286
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,922
- So you will do this?
ADDISON: Please sit.

287
00:14:40,496 --> 00:14:41,986
I ran your labs.

288
00:14:44,066 --> 00:14:45,897
Is someone still hurting you?

289
00:14:46,035 --> 00:14:48,094
- No.
- You said you were raped months ago.

290
00:14:48,237 --> 00:14:50,671
But there are traces of sperm, Sharbat.

291
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:53,741
Which indicates something
is still happening.

292
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,138
It's not rape.

293
00:14:59,281 --> 00:15:00,680
There was never a rape.

294
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:05,082
I didn't mean to lie, to take it this far.

295
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:08,155
I have a boyfriend here, and I love him.

296
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:11,851
But your father arranged a marriage
to someone else.

297
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,963
My parents, they do not know
about the boy. He's not from our culture.

298
00:15:15,097 --> 00:15:17,122
And so I told my mother,
I told her I'd been raped.

299
00:15:17,466 --> 00:15:20,026
I thought she'd understand this meant
I could not marry this man.

300
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,535
Only she found a way.

301
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:23,968
A way for us all to be happy.

302
00:15:24,106 --> 00:15:26,040
- Happy?
- My father drives a cab.

303
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,075
He used to teach university.

304
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,609
My mother, she is lonely.

305
00:15:29,745 --> 00:15:31,770
They came here for me,
but they are miserable.

306
00:15:31,914 --> 00:15:34,644
This man, he will bring us all back
and take care of us.

307
00:15:34,783 --> 00:15:36,182
But only if you're a virgin.

308
00:15:36,318 --> 00:15:37,876
If I am a virgin, we can go.

309
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,146
We can be happy.

310
00:15:39,288 --> 00:15:41,119
I want them to be happy.

311
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:48,694
I just wanted to apologize
for pushing you so hard

312
00:15:48,831 --> 00:15:50,696
when I first took over. That was wrong.

313
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,125
And, uh...

314
00:15:52,267 --> 00:15:55,236
All right, look. I know that you and Violet
are joined at the hip.

315
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,465
And she's gonna go for Naomi.
But you are your own man.

316
00:15:58,607 --> 00:16:03,101
- And I've got a lot of great ideas...
- Know anything about acquired aphasia?

317
00:16:03,245 --> 00:16:05,839
- Uh, a bit.
- This kid came in, he presented

318
00:16:05,981 --> 00:16:08,074
with what looked like late-onset autism.

319
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,980
- I think it might be something else.
- Why?

320
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:12,815
Well, we had this moment
of eye contact.

321
00:16:13,088 --> 00:16:15,113
All right.
Well, autistic kids make eye contact.

322
00:16:15,257 --> 00:16:18,886
I know, but this was real.
It really seemed like he was connecting.

323
00:16:19,261 --> 00:16:20,694
Kid stopped talking at 4.

324
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:24,993
Any chance he's having seizures
in his sleep, so maybe nobody noticed?

325
00:16:25,134 --> 00:16:27,762
- You think I'm grasping?
- I think you're a good doctor.

326
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,201
And if you feel
that there's something going on,

327
00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:31,567
then there probably is.

328
00:16:31,707 --> 00:16:35,575
Oh, this vote thing
makes you and Naomi nicer.

329
00:16:35,978 --> 00:16:37,878
Well, not everything is about the vote.

330
00:16:39,181 --> 00:16:41,706
You're a good doctor.
You'll figure it out.

331
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,282
MEG:
Big office.

332
00:16:46,955 --> 00:16:48,786
View of the ocean.

333
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,789
Patients who can pay the bills.

334
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,157
So, what's wrong?

335
00:16:54,797 --> 00:16:56,856
You were here
for a Developing Nations Conference.

336
00:16:56,999 --> 00:16:58,398
You never mentioned psychoanalysis.

- Aid mission to the Congo?
- Ghana.

never hesitated.

He jumped in
and did what needed doing.

00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,873
Then again, the Peter I remember
would've thrown me down on this desk

ten seconds after I walked in.

- Yeah...

- Wait until they come out.

Then we interrogate him. Or her.

00:18:09,805 --> 00:18:12,603
No. About my patient, Sharbat.
She lied. She wasn't raped.

361

- She lied?
- She has a boyfriend.

362
00:18:14,977 --> 00:18:17,207
She freaked out.
Couldn't tell her parents the truth.

363
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,439
- Knew it would come out.
- You don't lie about rape.

364
00:18:19,581 --> 00:18:21,048
- I know, but...
- There's no "buts."

365
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,707
That's what makes people
doubt women.

366
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:25,684
One woman does that, I don't care
the reason, it's bad for everybody.

00:18:25,821 --> 00:18:28,449
Damn it. I hate that.

00:18:31,426 --> 00:18:32,859
You shouldn't do this, the surgery.

- She lied, Addison.

and telling lies

No. She made her bed.

- We were residents together.

Then we did Doctors Without Borders
for a couple of years,

00:20:05,721 --> 00:20:09,213
- before he moved here.
- Whoa. Pete did Doctors Without Borders?

- When was that?
- Fifteen years ago.

He was supposed
to take a couple months off.

Married her.

- No. But you can tell us.

- Pete's a very private person.
- He's very shy.

396

- He doesn't like to brag.
- Trust me, he's not shy.

An evacuation was ordered,
but it was impossible to get the kids out.

Peter refused to leave the kids behind.

He stayed with them through the night.

because of him.

with Naomi is, right?

506
00:26:18,093 --> 00:26:20,687
Keep her secrets, hide her mistakes
then wait for the ax to drop.

507
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,797
NAOMl:
Sam doesn't care about this place.

508
00:26:22,931 --> 00:26:25,798
Well, this place wouldn't be anything
but broke if she's running things.

509
00:26:25,934 --> 00:26:28,027
Is this how you expect to get my vote?

510
00:26:32,073 --> 00:26:35,236
- You can't change what you did.
- And we can't live with what you're doing.

511
00:26:35,377 --> 00:26:36,639
Why are you fighting with me?

512
00:26:36,778 --> 00:26:40,043
I'm making progress here, all right?
I'm getting us up out of this hole.

513
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,512
NAOMl:
Because people aren't happy.

514
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:45,518
What, people aren't happy, or you're not
happy because it's not your way?

515
00:26:45,654 --> 00:26:47,144
NAOMl: My way?
SAM: What it comes down to.

516
00:26:47,289 --> 00:26:49,280
NAOMl: At least I have a way!
- Democracy in action.

517
00:26:49,424 --> 00:26:51,119
SAM: Admit it.
NAOMl: What are you talking about?

518
00:26:51,259 --> 00:26:54,194
I'm the one who did everything
in the beginning!

519
00:26:56,898 --> 00:26:58,422
I think lies are contagious.

520
00:26:58,566 --> 00:27:02,093
- Not telling us about his past is not a lie.
- It's an omission.

521
00:27:02,237 --> 00:27:03,534
Fine. That's one thing.

522
00:27:03,672 --> 00:27:05,435
- You lied about Charlotte.
- I told you.

523
00:27:05,573 --> 00:27:08,440
And now I have to not tell everybody else?
That's a lie.

524
00:27:08,576 --> 00:27:11,170
- Sam?
- Secretly sleeping with Naomi.

525
00:27:12,347 --> 00:27:13,644
Lie. Lie.

526
00:27:13,782 --> 00:27:15,079
- Dell?
- Kept Naomi's secret.

527
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:16,683
Omission. Lie.

528
00:27:16,818 --> 00:27:18,012
Addison?

529
00:27:18,153 --> 00:27:21,520
Well, her patient lied about being raped.
I guess I can't hold that against her.

530
00:27:21,656 --> 00:27:23,817
You may be the only one here
that's trustworthy.

00:27:33,101 --> 00:27:35,592
Do you really think you could help him?

533
00:27:37,205 --> 00:27:39,002
If we give Braden prednisone now,

534
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,631
it'll absorb into his bloodstream
in a matter of hours.

535
00:27:41,776 --> 00:27:44,609
Before he goes to bed
we could know if it'll help.

536
00:27:51,686 --> 00:27:54,120
Did you work in Africa,
treating kids with river blindness?

537
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:56,189
Have you heard about him
and the Bosnian orphans?

538
00:27:56,324 --> 00:27:57,586
NAOMl: No.
- Where did you hear that?

539
00:27:57,726 --> 00:27:59,921
- In the ladies' room.
- What do you people do in there?

540
00:28:00,061 --> 00:28:02,962
Why didn't you tell us
you had this whole past, Pete?

541
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,622
Peter.

542
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,701
- Peter?
- It was a long time ago.

543
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,505
You really like her.

544
00:28:22,317 --> 00:28:24,979
Look, Sharbat.

545
00:28:26,054 --> 00:28:27,214
I know you want this.

546
00:28:27,355 --> 00:28:29,414
- You think you want this.
- It's the only way.

547
00:28:29,557 --> 00:28:32,754
It may be the only way for this man
you're supposed to marry, but for you?

548
00:28:33,361 --> 00:28:36,125
You need to figure out
what's right for you.

549
00:28:36,264 --> 00:28:38,255
Look, you told your mother
about the rape.

550
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,925
Tell her about this boy you love.

551
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:46,734
Do you really want your future
to be based on a lie?

552
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:54,480
Have you been having fatigue,
headache, joint pains?

553
00:28:54,616 --> 00:28:58,347
I've been on and off airplanes all month,
in half a dozen different time zones.

554
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:00,818
Yes, I have.

555
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:02,850
Oh, come on, Sam. What is it?

556
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,322
SAM:
It's... There we go.

557
00:29:06,227 --> 00:29:07,660
This.

558
00:29:07,796 --> 00:29:11,493
- That was in my back?
- Yeah, it's the remnants of a tick.

559
00:29:11,633 --> 00:29:13,760
Probably been in there a week or so.

560
00:29:13,902 --> 00:29:17,133
Pete was right.
These things can cause a nasty infection.

If you would've let it last any longer

562
00:29:19,941 --> 00:29:23,604
you could've wound up with serious
cardiac problems, encephalitis...

563
00:29:23,745 --> 00:29:24,871
Wow, thank you.

564
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,446
Well, you can thank Peter.

565
00:29:28,216 --> 00:29:32,152
I don't suppose I could pay you off
to say it was a sand fly bite?

- I decided the truth seemed better.

00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:51,570
Speaking of which

570
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:54,800
why is it that no one seems
to know anything about you?

00:29:54,943 --> 00:29:56,843
- You know me.
- We don't even know your name.

Peter.

573
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,377
Look, the past is the past.

574
00:30:00,515 --> 00:30:01,709
I'm not one to dwell on it.

575
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:06,082
But Meg,
she seems like a good part of your past.

576
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,848
She's here now.

577
00:30:07,989 --> 00:30:10,549
Then she'll be gone.

578
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:13,091
- So it is what it is.
- Unless it isn't.

579
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,389
You could not let her go.

580
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:17,794
You know what your problem is?

00:30:17,932 --> 00:30:19,524
You are a romantic.

You don't want them running this place
together, you want them together.

583
00:30:22,871 --> 00:30:26,398
Sam and Naomi, the way it was.
You and Naomi the way it was.

584
00:30:26,541 --> 00:30:29,237
What's wrong with that?
I like the way it was.

585
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:45,858
Thank you.

00:30:46,294 --> 00:30:52,358
What Sharbat is asking for,
what she wants to give up is a lot.

00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,967
I thought you should know the truth.

588
00:30:55,803 --> 00:30:56,963
I knew.

589
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,767
Mothers are mothers.
What she couldn't tell me, I knew.

590
00:30:59,908 --> 00:31:01,170
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

591
00:31:01,309 --> 00:31:02,606
You let her say she was raped?

592
00:31:02,744 --> 00:31:05,907
If she broke the trust
that her father and I have in her,

593
00:31:06,047 --> 00:31:07,378
it would be her sin.

594
00:31:07,515 --> 00:31:08,641
She would have felt shame.

595
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,876
It was easier for her to say
it was someone else's.

596
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,922

00:31:15,356 --> 00:31:17,620

Uh...

599
00:31:21,396 --> 00:31:23,330
Sharbat, no matter what I do,

600
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:25,432
I can't make you forget
what you had here.

601
00:31:25,567 --> 00:31:28,263
I love my parents
more than anything in this world.

602

you got me out of the marriage,

606
00:31:45,086 --> 00:31:48,146
now you and Addison can go ahead
and take over the practice.

607
00:31:48,289 --> 00:31:50,257
Maybe I'll go work over at St. Ambrose.

Maybe I'll do that. No, really.

I'm sure that I could find a job there
because I'm sick...

- We're trying to have a conversation.
- I don't care.

Oh, great.

00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,536
Look, maybe this is my fault.

00:32:08,943 --> 00:32:12,640
I pushed us to try to recapture the past.

614
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:15,715
What we had,
what this place used to be.

615
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:20,685
But the past is cluttered with anger
and mistakes and we need to bury that.

616
00:32:20,822 --> 00:32:23,086
It doesn't matter who did what when.

617
00:32:23,224 --> 00:32:27,285
It matters what we want to do now, what
we want this place to be going forward.

618
00:32:27,428 --> 00:32:30,056
We need to focus on patients.

619
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:33,725
And we need to earn money.
We need Naomi and we need Sam.

00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:36,063
The best of both of you.

621
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,296
And this vote?

622
00:32:37,438 --> 00:32:41,272
It's a bad idea.
An idea that we might never recover from.

623
00:32:41,409 --> 00:32:42,535
We shouldn't do it.

624
00:32:42,677 --> 00:32:46,738
Let's sit down and figure out
what we want this place to be, together.

He's just a boy.

00:33:36,664 --> 00:33:38,689
He's a nice boy.

632
00:33:38,833 --> 00:33:41,131
But we would not last.

633
00:33:42,303 --> 00:33:45,101
He's young, he's got college.

634
00:33:45,673 --> 00:33:47,971
He's so American.

635
00:33:48,242 --> 00:33:50,369
He's not my future.

636
00:33:52,747 --> 00:33:53,941
I want to do this.

637
00:33:54,082 --> 00:33:56,915
So, yes, I am ready.

You're welcome.

you are a wonderful doctor.

00:35:08,322 --> 00:35:09,687
So we're really gonna do this?

645
00:35:16,798 --> 00:35:19,232
I'm not voting. I won't be a part of this.

646
00:35:27,341 --> 00:35:29,309

Let's count the votes we have.

00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:42,382
Addison.

650
00:35:44,158 --> 00:35:45,989
Okay, whoever did that, it is not funny.

651
00:35:48,429 --> 00:35:50,363
Addison.

652
00:35:50,631 --> 00:35:52,496
Addison.

No, no, no.

655
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:05,177
No, no.

656
00:36:08,783 --> 00:36:10,910
- Nice speech.

00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,188
Congratulations, boss.

658
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:18,786
Even you voted for me?

659
00:36:19,327 --> 00:36:23,058
If either one of them had won,
this place still would've been divided.

660
00:36:27,201 --> 00:36:29,761
What am I supposed to do now?

661
00:36:29,904 --> 00:36:32,134
Figure out what the future is.

662
00:36:32,673 --> 00:36:34,106
Figure out what the new rules are.

663
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:36,807
You think rules really work?

664
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:39,504
So long as you remember
they're meant to be broken.

665
00:36:39,647 --> 00:36:40,705
Hey, Violet.

666
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,411
About what happened in your office...

667
00:36:45,553 --> 00:36:47,316
- I don't wanna talk about that.
- You sure?

668
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,389
We're not...
We're not going there, Addison.

669
00:36:51,158 --> 00:36:53,058
It is what it is.

670
00:37:14,882 --> 00:37:17,112
I'm sorry, Naomi.

671
00:37:20,087 --> 00:37:23,147
If I could can go back
and change what I did,

672
00:37:24,125 --> 00:37:25,615
how I treated you

673
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,957
I messed up.

674
00:37:29,463 --> 00:37:31,192
I'm sorry.

675
00:38:20,314 --> 00:38:22,043
Thank you.

For worrying about me.

You know,
I really could use you in Ghana.

But don't you remember
what it was like?

part of the world we were in,

no matter what disaster
or disease we were fighting,

people always responded to you.

I forgot you came with cigarettes.

690
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:07,621
So is that an invitation?

Something like that.

No.

Do I look like a person
who takes no for an answer?

00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:46,327
I would very much like it
if we could spend the evening talking.

Again with the talking?

701
00:39:48,069 --> 00:39:49,866
We're gonna get to know each other.

Why?

703
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:55,640
Because, Herr Charlotte,
I want us to be about more than sex.

I was adopted, and I never cared.

711
00:40:12,893 --> 00:40:15,919
I never sought out my birth parents
because my parents were great.

712

00:40:19,633 --> 00:40:22,033

in Indiana,

00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:25,866

that I loved children. Uh...

I wanted to be a pediatrician.

coming out of my mouth.
