- Hello.
- Hey. So listen, just hear me out.

00:00:40,256 --> 00:00:41,314
So?

9
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,358
Hates me too.

10
00:00:57,841 --> 00:00:58,899
Am I boring you?

11
00:00:59,042 --> 00:01:00,634
Sorry, I'm supposed to be at a meeting.

12
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:02,169
Violet's meeting.

13
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:05,042
Violet's super-secret meeting
to overthrow the government.

14
00:01:05,682 --> 00:01:07,149
You people are odd.

15
00:01:07,283 --> 00:01:10,252
Now that Sam's running things,
he's pushing us to book more

16
00:01:10,386 --> 00:01:12,047
and change things and so on.

17
00:01:12,188 --> 00:01:14,247
- And so I don't get properly laid?
- Yes.

18
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,119
You're the victim.
You're the silent victim.

19
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:19,592
Not like you've given me permission to tell
Violet why I can't come to her meeting.

- Do not tell Violet about us.
- I know.

00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,322
I have to go. I'll make it up to you.

00:01:37,947 --> 00:01:39,278
It's a symptom of the disease.

00:01:39,716 --> 00:01:40,944
PETE:
It's a board with dots on it.

26
00:01:41,084 --> 00:01:43,279
This practice used to be
about people working together.

27
00:01:43,419 --> 00:01:46,855
This board is about people
looking out for themselves.

28
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:48,082
It's profit-centric.

29
00:01:48,224 --> 00:01:49,316
It's not patient-centric.

30
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:51,450
It's about unilateral decision-making.

31
00:01:51,594 --> 00:01:53,357
And assembly-line medicine,

32
00:01:53,496 --> 00:01:58,024
like Sam's executive physicals
and the Cheetah Girl temp.

33
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:05,433
- She's another symptom, hormone man.
- She's a cute symptom.

- Naomi?
- I am not in charge anymore.

00:02:09,245 --> 00:02:10,542
Let Sam try it Sam's way.

36
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,046
Sam and Addison pulled off a coup.

37
00:02:13,183 --> 00:02:15,879
Dell's gone. We have to do something.

38
00:02:18,955 --> 00:02:21,116
ADDISON: Looks like
we missed the secret meeting.

39
00:02:21,257 --> 00:02:23,122
We weren't invited.

40
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:24,621
We did the right thing, right?

41
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,256
Yes, we did the right thing,
the only thing we could do.

00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:30,594

It will blow over.

- Yes.

Morning, Sam, Addison.

46
00:02:37,473 --> 00:02:40,965
SAM:
Oh, I thought you weren't talking to us.

47
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:44,477
While I am not talking to you socially,
I am talking to you professionally,

48
00:02:44,614 --> 00:02:46,605
because this is a place of business.

49
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:49,650
So morning, Sam, Addison.

50
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,614
Ugh.

Hey, guys.

52
00:02:59,162 --> 00:03:00,959
ADDISON: Morning.
- Nice board, Sam.

53
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,394
Oh, thanks. Yeah.

54
00:03:02,532 --> 00:03:05,660
Dell's gone, so I'm just trying
to keep track of scheduling.

55
00:03:05,802 --> 00:03:08,703
Oh, I thought
it was something different.

56
00:03:09,505 --> 00:03:10,870
- What?
- I thought that you wanted

57
00:03:11,007 --> 00:03:14,465
to publicly humiliate
everyone who wasn't booking enough.

58
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:19,378
So you put your big showy board of shame
in this fishbowl for everyone to see.

59
00:03:19,515 --> 00:03:20,641
No, that's not...

60
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:23,217
It's not a board of shame.

61
00:03:23,353 --> 00:03:26,186
It's a board of accomplishments.

62
00:03:26,322 --> 00:03:27,789
SAM: Yes.
- Well, you would say that.

63
00:03:27,924 --> 00:03:29,357
It's a board with dots on it.

64
00:03:29,492 --> 00:03:31,392
- I would say that?
- You're on Sam's side.

65
00:03:31,527 --> 00:03:33,654
- No, no, Violet. I'm on the practice's side.
SAM: Wait.

66
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:37,823
Hey, hey. This board is a...
It's a useful tool.

67
00:03:38,234 --> 00:03:39,826
All right? Now, just give it a chance.

68
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:41,732
The dots, they tell me who's busy.

69
00:03:41,871 --> 00:03:44,203
Now if we'll look over here,
Pete is all empty here.

70
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,867
I can tell that he's available to help me
with the executive physicals.

71
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:50,206
All right, that's a big group deal we cut.

72
00:03:50,346 --> 00:03:51,404
Cash influx.

73
00:03:51,547 --> 00:03:53,276
PETE:
I'm sorry, but I don't have time.

74
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,043
The board would indicate otherwise.

75
00:03:56,286 --> 00:03:59,585
Oh, Pete... Well,
you can't just make up patients, Pete.

76
00:03:59,722 --> 00:04:00,984
I'm not.

77
00:04:01,124 --> 00:04:03,558
I made a few calls
and I'm trying something new.

78
00:04:03,693 --> 00:04:04,751
To drum up business.

00:04:05,695 --> 00:04:06,753
VIOLET:
What the hell is that?

80
00:04:06,896 --> 00:04:09,421
It's a cutting-edge,
noninvasive cellulite reduction system.

81
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:11,427
It's a defatalator?

82
00:04:11,868 --> 00:04:13,495
SAM:
Good thinking.

83
00:04:13,636 --> 00:04:15,968
- Your column's weak, Coop.
COOPER: I'm on it.

84
00:04:16,105 --> 00:04:18,232
VIOLET: Do you see
what this board of shame is doing?

85
00:04:18,374 --> 00:04:19,864
Cooper can't even look at it.

86
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,671
You've forced Pete
to defat innocent people.

87
00:04:22,812 --> 00:04:26,111
- Noninvasive cellulite re...
- If this is where this practice is headed...

88
00:04:26,249 --> 00:04:28,080
We're headed towards bankruptcy.

89
00:04:28,217 --> 00:04:31,709
I hope this is an acceptable detour.

90
00:04:33,489 --> 00:04:35,423
I can't take it. I honestly cannot take it.

91
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:38,584
Don't you care?
You didn't show up for the meeting.

92
00:04:38,728 --> 00:04:40,218
I was doing... I was doing something.

93
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,694
What?

94
00:04:42,999 --> 00:04:47,902
Cooper, I just wanna say that if there
is something that you wanna tell me

95
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:50,699
but you're afraid to tell me,
you could tell me anyway.

96
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,467
I won't get mad.

97
00:04:52,942 --> 00:04:54,967
We're friends. I'm your friend.

98
00:04:55,111 --> 00:05:00,378
So anything you would like
to not keep secret, I'm open.

99
00:05:00,516 --> 00:05:03,076
I'm sorry I wasn't at the meeting.

100
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:04,846
I just... I need to stay under the radar.

101
00:05:04,988 --> 00:05:08,617
I don't wanna be the dead weight that
gets traded out for the plastic surgeon.

102
00:05:08,758 --> 00:05:10,749
Hey, Coop, come on. That's an excuse.

103
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,292
Tell me.

104
00:05:12,595 --> 00:05:15,792
Do we have to share every detail?
Do we have to be joined at the hip?

105
00:05:15,932 --> 00:05:18,264
- We're not 12.
- Oh, glad you could clear that up for me.

106
00:05:19,035 --> 00:05:20,161
I was so sure we were 12.

107
00:05:21,938 --> 00:05:24,406
I know we're young,
but we've been married for five years

108
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,337
and we've been dreaming
about kids for longer.

109
00:05:26,476 --> 00:05:27,875
Yeah, since junior high.

110
00:05:28,011 --> 00:05:30,241
- Junior high?
- That's where we met.

111
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:34,543
One day, I was a complete loner
and then the next day, I had Lisa.

112
00:05:34,684 --> 00:05:36,584
It's like looking into a mirror.

113
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:40,416
Same interests, same CDs,
same books, movies.

114
00:05:40,556 --> 00:05:42,490
We even have the same allergies.

115
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,185
- Grass, peanuts.
- And peanuts. Yeah.

116
00:05:45,328 --> 00:05:47,319
I found my best friend.

117
00:05:47,463 --> 00:05:51,092
Do you know how rare that is,
to find a best friend?

118
00:05:52,001 --> 00:05:54,026
- Yeah.
- We already decorated the nursery.

119
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,967
Yeah. We just need the baby.

120
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,363
Please?

121
00:05:58,808 --> 00:05:59,866
Okay.

122
00:06:02,145 --> 00:06:05,512
So you're really not going to speak to me
about anything other than work?

123
00:06:05,815 --> 00:06:08,113
For instance, the cop, Kevin.
He hasn't called.

124
00:06:08,251 --> 00:06:11,118
We had a date, I thought it was
a good date and then he didn't call.

125
00:06:12,055 --> 00:06:14,649
Which is something you and I
would normally talk about.

126
00:06:15,258 --> 00:06:16,350
Really?

127
00:06:16,492 --> 00:06:18,119
You really wanna do this?

128
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:20,024
I'll take Brian, you take Lisa?

129
00:06:21,831 --> 00:06:23,389
Fine.

My day is filled with Jensen employees.

131
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:30,036
Oh, well, if anyone else had tried
to sell me on executive physicals,

132
00:06:30,173 --> 00:06:33,074
I would have thought
it was a crock and a sales pitch.

133
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:35,473
But I've watched you with my son
for so long.

00:06:35,611 --> 00:06:39,047
Well, Kirk is amazing,
given all that he's been through.

135
00:06:39,182 --> 00:06:41,514
Well, it turns out your good business
is my good business.

is through the roof.

that your employees are happy.

They love seeing you.

00:06:48,558 --> 00:06:49,650
I wish Kirk did too.

140
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:51,419
I had to drag him here today.

141
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:54,052
Does he need another lecture
on taking his meds?

00:06:54,897 --> 00:06:57,559
Seventeen years old.
Thinks he knows better than everyone.

143
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,031
I hate this disease.

144
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,432
I didn't know it could damage
his lung tissue so badly.

145
00:07:01,571 --> 00:07:04,369
Yeah, bronchiolitis obliterans
can be brutal.

146
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,065
He's still getting dizzy from the meds?

147
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:09,269
His breathing's getting worse.
I stay on him.

148
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:11,845
If his mother were alive,
she would know how to talk to him.

149
00:07:11,981 --> 00:07:14,040
See, the more I push,
the more he pushes back.

- Help me get him on the table.

00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,121
I need some help in here.

00:07:20,256 --> 00:07:22,349
CHARLIE: Kirk.
- I need an intubation kit now.

154
00:07:22,725 --> 00:07:24,750
- He's not breathing.
- He's in respiratory arrest.

I got Brian
and Lisa's genetic tests back.

- No, but I know why they shouldn't.

What am I looking for here?

There's no mark for Down's syndrome,
Tay-Sachs. They look healthy.

Individually, they are.

160
00:07:45,748 --> 00:07:48,649
But as a couple...

161
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,882
Almost a quarter of their genes
are the same.

162
00:07:53,022 --> 00:07:55,490
They're not just husband and wife.

up and down the hallway?

I need Dell or an extra set of hands.

00:08:18,114 --> 00:08:21,982
But it does break it down.
And with exercise and diet, herbs...

171
00:08:22,118 --> 00:08:23,312
It's a quick fix, Pete.

172
00:08:23,452 --> 00:08:24,714
This is not us.

173
00:08:24,854 --> 00:08:27,652
Patients come to see us
because we take care of all of them.

174
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:30,020
Body, mind, soul.

175
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:31,786
Sam is paving the road to hell.

176
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,793
- It's just a machine.
- It's hamburger.

177
00:08:34,197 --> 00:08:35,858
We used to give them steak.

178
00:08:35,998 --> 00:08:37,260
People like hamburger.

179
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,838
SAM: The scarring from the virus
has gotten much worse.

180
00:08:44,974 --> 00:08:47,568
And his lung function tests
show a large decline.

181
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:50,042
But you can get him through this, right?
Get him back home?

182
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:52,272
Well, being on a ventilator
will help heal his lungs.

183
00:08:52,415 --> 00:08:55,111
Hopefully we can get him home.
He's gonna need a lot more attention.

184
00:08:55,251 --> 00:08:57,481
Oxygen supplementation, IV meds.

185
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,418
Well, I'll scale back at work,
I don't care.

186
00:09:00,556 --> 00:09:02,922
The idea of losing him too...

187
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:04,492
Hey.

188
00:09:06,329 --> 00:09:08,524
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Whoa, Kirk. Kirk.

189
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,857
I don't want this.

190
00:09:11,601 --> 00:09:14,229
- I told you already. I can't do it again.
- Don't say that.

191
00:09:15,938 --> 00:09:17,303
Just put this back in. Now.

192
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,702
No, it hurts.

193
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:20,308
This is the fourth time, Dad.

194
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,241
I can't do it.

195
00:09:22,378 --> 00:09:24,744
I can't talk, I can't do anything.

196
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,542
Kirk, the intubation is only temporary.

197
00:09:27,683 --> 00:09:28,775
I'm getting worse.

198
00:09:28,918 --> 00:09:31,546
Dad, tracheotomy is next.
I can't do that.

199
00:09:31,687 --> 00:09:34,747
I will throw everything I have at this.
We will find something.

200
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,586
This gives us time. Do it.

201
00:09:38,728 --> 00:09:40,127
- Don't.
- All right, fine, Kirk.

202
00:09:40,263 --> 00:09:41,992
All right. No tube. Not right now.

203
00:09:42,131 --> 00:09:44,031
Just breathe.

204
00:09:46,469 --> 00:09:48,767
- There we go.
- I don't want this life.

205
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,700
Not this way.

206
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,365
Let me die.

207
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,351
Thanks, Dr. Nayar.

208
00:10:10,993 --> 00:10:12,426
- Sperm donor.
- Sperm donor.

209
00:10:13,229 --> 00:10:17,222
The parents used the same sperm donor.
What are the chances?

210
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:20,631
Well, 25 years ago, there were only
a couple of fertility clinics in this town.

211
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:23,432
Everybody having trouble getting pregnant
went to the same doctor?

212
00:10:23,572 --> 00:10:26,905
And the doctors used the same batch
of donors over and over again.

213
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,978
Makes you think twice
about messing with Mother Nature, huh?

214
00:10:30,112 --> 00:10:32,376
I don't mess with Mother Nature.

215
00:10:32,515 --> 00:10:35,279
- I use science.
- No, I wasn't saying l...

216
00:10:35,418 --> 00:10:37,579
- I was just saying that...
- Right.

217
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,015
So how do we tell them?

218
00:10:41,157 --> 00:10:45,958
How do we tell a couple that's meant
to be together that they're not?

219
00:10:50,099 --> 00:10:52,192
Well, everything they know
is gonna be tainted.

220
00:10:52,335 --> 00:10:53,996
Their childhood, their families.

221
00:10:54,136 --> 00:10:56,161
We have to let them know
that it's not their fault.

222
00:10:56,305 --> 00:10:57,363
Well, it isn't.

223
00:10:57,506 --> 00:10:59,337
They didn't know
they were brother and sister.

224
00:10:59,475 --> 00:11:01,705
And no one else needs to know.

225
00:11:01,844 --> 00:11:04,005
Who they tell, what they say,
that's their choice.

226
00:11:04,146 --> 00:11:08,310
So not only do they have to split up,
they have to lie to everyone they know.

227
00:11:08,451 --> 00:11:10,248
Well, incest is a loaded word.

228
00:11:10,386 --> 00:11:13,878
The visceral response is revulsion,
ostracism.

229
00:11:14,023 --> 00:11:17,117
- They look like...
- Any other young couple in love.

230
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:19,193
ADDISON: And we get to be the ones
to break their hearts.

231
00:11:22,832 --> 00:11:26,495
You coach two Little League teams, you're
telling me you don't know one sick kid?

232
00:11:28,003 --> 00:11:29,937
Not even a cold?

233
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:31,936
Okay. Gotta go. Bye.

234
00:11:32,074 --> 00:11:33,598
That's your plan to get new business?

235
00:11:33,743 --> 00:11:35,301
- Cold calling?
- No.

236
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,644
No.

237
00:11:39,014 --> 00:11:40,948
- It worked for Pete.
- You wanna get some lunch?

238
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,448
Take a break from the madness?

239
00:11:42,585 --> 00:11:43,711
Can't, I'm already booked.

240
00:11:43,853 --> 00:11:44,945
- With?
- A friend.

241
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:48,147
I know you're lying to me.

242
00:11:48,524 --> 00:11:49,889
You know you're lying to me.

243
00:11:50,025 --> 00:11:52,493
We both know and yet, lying.

244
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,061
What is wrong with you?

245
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:09,805
It's crazy, but I feel lighter already.

246
00:12:09,945 --> 00:12:11,572
Well, that's only step one.

247
00:12:11,714 --> 00:12:15,115
To really see results, you have to stick
to the exercise and diet we discussed.

248
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:16,309
And the herbs.

249
00:12:16,452 --> 00:12:18,545
Well, maybe I'll just come back
every day.

250
00:12:18,687 --> 00:12:20,746
That seems easier.

251
00:12:25,861 --> 00:12:27,692
Did you get Kirk stabilized?

252
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,661
SAM:
Temporarily.

253
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:32,666
When he came to,
he extubated himself.

254
00:12:32,802 --> 00:12:34,064
He's letting himself die.

255
00:12:34,203 --> 00:12:37,832
He is dying. Maybe it's time to start
thinking about hospice instead of hospital.

256
00:12:37,973 --> 00:12:39,167
No, Charlie won't do that.

257
00:12:39,308 --> 00:12:40,434
Come on. How old is Kirk?

258
00:12:40,576 --> 00:12:42,407
Well, he won't be 18 until next month.

259
00:12:42,545 --> 00:12:44,012
COOPER:
Who's not 18, that new receptionist?

260
00:12:44,146 --> 00:12:45,579
No, my patient.

261
00:12:45,714 --> 00:12:48,683
And because the poor kid crashes
a few weeks shy of his 18th birthday,

262
00:12:48,818 --> 00:12:50,877
you're gonna force him
to indulge his father's grief

263
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,920
with an intubation tube jammed
down his throat?

264
00:12:53,055 --> 00:12:56,047
Until what, the ulcers and hemorrhaging
get so bad, he needs a trach?

265
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,456
No 17-year-old should be
making life-and-death decisions.

266
00:12:58,594 --> 00:13:00,562
PETE:
He's been fighting this since he was 12.

267
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:04,127
- He's done.
- Look, Charlie's wife died two years ago.

268
00:13:04,266 --> 00:13:08,259
Now you want me to fault him for wanting
to buy his son just a little more time?

269
00:13:08,404 --> 00:13:10,201
Time for Kirk to live?

270
00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:12,034
Or for Charlie to hold on?

271
00:13:16,645 --> 00:13:18,306
LISA:
We're brother and sister?

272
00:13:20,749 --> 00:13:24,310
My parents never even told me
my father wasn't my father.

273
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:28,914
Well, I'm sure they didn't think it
was anything that would ever be relevant.

274
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:32,494
And for all intents and purposes,
it wasn't.

275
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:35,997
This is a nightmare.

276
00:13:37,099 --> 00:13:39,260
Look, this is a lot to absorb.

277
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,665
Why don't we give you a few minutes?

278
00:13:52,448 --> 00:13:54,143
NAOMl:
Did you see the look on her face?

279
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,083
You were very good with them though.

280
00:13:59,288 --> 00:14:02,451
See, normally, this would be the part
where I'd be asking you about Kevin again,

281
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,718
if I should call him
even though he hasn't called me.

282
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,385
Normally, that's what we'd be doing,
if you were talking to me.

283
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:08,588
- Don't.
- Nai...

284
00:14:08,731 --> 00:14:10,494
Look, I'm being an adult about this,
Addison.

285
00:14:10,633 --> 00:14:13,033
It does not mean that I forgive you.

286
00:14:15,037 --> 00:14:16,197
Thank you for telling us.

287
00:14:16,338 --> 00:14:18,602
If there's anything that we can do...

288
00:14:18,741 --> 00:14:20,208
You can help us get pregnant.

289
00:14:21,544 --> 00:14:23,011
But we just told you that...

290
00:14:23,145 --> 00:14:25,943
We heard what you said,
but we're soul mates.

291
00:14:26,081 --> 00:14:27,844
We love each other.

292
00:14:27,983 --> 00:14:29,917
We're staying together.

293
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:42,393
Cousins get married all the time.
They have kids. Why can't we?

294
00:14:42,531 --> 00:14:45,932
Because your children would have
a 300-times-greater chance

295
00:14:46,068 --> 00:14:48,662
of developing a genetic disorder
which could be fatal.

296
00:14:49,905 --> 00:14:51,202
What about sperm donation?

297
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:54,138
For a couple who by law
shouldn't be married,

298
00:14:54,276 --> 00:14:55,868
- I can't.
- Then we'll adopt.

299
00:14:56,011 --> 00:14:59,208
The first thing an adoption agency
will look at is your medical history.

300
00:14:59,348 --> 00:15:01,646
They'll see your relationship
and they won't.

301
00:15:01,784 --> 00:15:03,046
I'm sorry.

302
00:15:03,185 --> 00:15:06,086
So no kids.

303
00:15:06,221 --> 00:15:07,415
Hey.

304
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:09,587
BRIAN:
We just forget about kids.

305
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:14,160
- As long as we can be together.
- Without sex.

306
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:17,090
Because no birth control
is 100 percent.

307
00:15:21,604 --> 00:15:23,504
Then tie my tubes.

308
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,830
Lisa, you're 23 years old.

309
00:15:25,975 --> 00:15:29,604
Just tie them so I never have
to think about this again.

310
00:15:36,986 --> 00:15:39,181
SAM: You were supposed to remind me
about the health fair.

311
00:15:39,321 --> 00:15:40,583
Oh, sorry.

312
00:15:40,723 --> 00:15:41,781
Wait.

313
00:15:41,924 --> 00:15:44,256
The company that rents
your ultrasound machines did call

314
00:15:44,393 --> 00:15:46,759
and they're gonna send a truck
to pick them up around 1.

315
00:15:46,895 --> 00:15:48,453
Pick them up? Did they mention why?

316
00:15:48,597 --> 00:15:50,565
- You haven't paid in three months.
- What?

317
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:51,893
VIOLET: Are you okay?
- Hey.

318
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,592
- Yeah.
- Can you cover the health fair?

319
00:15:53,736 --> 00:15:54,896
- Please?
- I don't know.

320
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,471
I'm working through lunch.
Check the board.

321
00:15:58,073 --> 00:16:00,701
Uh-huh. Cooper, my man, health fair.

322
00:16:00,843 --> 00:16:02,105
Great way to get new patients.

323
00:16:02,244 --> 00:16:03,711
I have lunch plans.

324
00:16:03,846 --> 00:16:05,370
More important than the practice?

325
00:16:05,681 --> 00:16:07,649
- Really?
- What website did you find her on?

326
00:16:07,783 --> 00:16:09,478
Yeah, Cooper, which website?

327
00:16:10,185 --> 00:16:12,312
I have a limit
to how far you can push, Violet.

328
00:16:12,454 --> 00:16:14,888
SAM: All right, grab a stethoscope,
go get some damn balloons

329
00:16:15,257 --> 00:16:18,317
and go charm some mothers
who don't know any better.

330
00:16:36,145 --> 00:16:40,673
SAM:
I'm hiding medical equipment.

331
00:16:40,816 --> 00:16:45,753
I've been reduced
to hiding medical equipment.

332
00:16:45,888 --> 00:16:51,349
Well, I have been asked to tie the tubes
of a perfectly healthy young woman

333
00:16:51,493 --> 00:16:53,324
so that she can sleep with her brother.

334
00:16:53,796 --> 00:16:56,458
Incest trumps equipment-hiding.

335
00:16:57,499 --> 00:16:59,433
Incest, that's nasty.

336
00:16:59,868 --> 00:17:01,335
So, what does Naomi say?

337
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:05,804
That is a very good question, Sam.

338

Sorry. Yeah, leave me a message.

507
00:25:35,817 --> 00:25:39,082
Actually, the treatment is performed
on the whole body,

508
00:25:39,221 --> 00:25:42,452
adapted for the skin sensitivity
of each individual, so...

509
00:25:42,591 --> 00:25:43,649
This place is bad enough

510

to sell your magic beans to everyone.

she needs help?

Does that body need

anything?

00:25:52,601 --> 00:25:56,662
I mean, does any body really need
its fat pulverized into submission?

You are a judger.

Everyone who comes through that door,

they don't want to talk about
a healthy life plan. All they want is magic.

with the executive physicals, but the...

Sam, we can do better. I know we can.

691
00:36:15,122 --> 00:36:17,022
I know we need money,
but at the end of the day,

692
00:36:17,158 --> 00:36:20,525
if we can't treat patients
the way they should be treated,

693
00:36:21,329 --> 00:36:23,126
then what's the point?

694
00:36:34,242 --> 00:36:37,143
I just need a little faith.

695
00:36:51,492 --> 00:36:53,289
What do you want?

696
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:56,429
I did what you asked,
because I had convinced myself

697
00:36:56,564 --> 00:36:58,361
that it was the right thing to do for Kirk.

698
00:36:58,499 --> 00:37:01,559
But the truth was
I was protecting the wrong person.

699
00:37:01,702 --> 00:37:03,226
This isn't about protecting me.

700
00:37:03,371 --> 00:37:05,066
No, I meant me.

701
00:37:05,206 --> 00:37:07,231
I was protecting myself
from your threat.

702
00:37:08,276 --> 00:37:10,005
And that's not the kind of doctor I am.

703
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:12,135
That's not the kind of doctor
that I wanna be.

704
00:37:13,547 --> 00:37:19,008
You asked me if it was somebody I loved,
what I would do?

705
00:37:20,388 --> 00:37:23,016
And it would kill me, Charlie.

706
00:37:23,357 --> 00:37:26,485
But I wouldn't wanna force someone
to live a way that they couldn't live with.

707
00:37:27,028 --> 00:37:30,520
Because that would be for me
and not for them.

we can here, Sam.

I understand wanting to throw everything
at a problem, Charlie.

712
00:37:42,443 --> 00:37:46,607
In business, maybe you do that
and maybe it works.

713
00:37:47,481 --> 00:37:49,847
But you end up losing a bit of yourself
along the way.

714
00:37:53,154 --> 00:37:55,987

I'm sorry.

- Yeah, I hate you, too, but you do matter.
