1
00:00:05,989 --> 00:00:07,718
So surfing, huh?
You're into surfing now?

2
00:00:07,857 --> 00:00:10,382
- You should see her room.
- She's got surf posters everywhere.

3
00:00:10,527 --> 00:00:12,188
As soon as my heart is better,

4
00:00:12,328 --> 00:00:15,525
I'm to have a birthday party on the beach,
and I'm going to learn how to surf.

5
00:00:15,665 --> 00:00:18,498
I'm watching them from my window,
and it's totally cool.

6
00:00:18,635 --> 00:00:19,932
That sounds totally awesome.

7
00:00:20,203 --> 00:00:22,501
- So how's our patient doing?
- Annie, this is Dr. Barnes.

8
00:00:22,806 --> 00:00:25,001
Dr. Barnes is gonna remove the tumor
from your heart.

9
00:00:25,141 --> 00:00:26,631
ANNIE:
What happened to the other guy?

10
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:28,607
Oh, this guy's much better
than the other guy.

11
00:00:28,745 --> 00:00:30,736
Dr. Barnes is the best heart guy in L.A.

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,814
This is your last surgery,
that's how good he is.

13
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:36,976
And so I snagged him for you,
because I'm on your side. Right? Right.

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,146
Well, it is a six-hour procedure,
so we should probably get going.

15
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,484
Right, Annie?

16
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:43,558
- You'll be here when I come out?
- I'll be here.

17
00:00:51,534 --> 00:00:54,128
Don't look so scared. It's gonna be fine.

18
00:01:16,593 --> 00:01:19,494
- Finishing or starting?
- Finishing. You?

19
00:01:19,629 --> 00:01:20,721
Starting.

20
00:01:20,864 --> 00:01:24,664
I've got a myocardial resection on a kid.
Hate working on kids.

21
00:01:24,801 --> 00:01:27,326
Feel like I'm holding my breath
the entire time.

22
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:30,439
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I work on babies sometimes.

23
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,274
Mm. So you come here often?

24
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:34,603
[CHUCKLES]

25
00:01:34,744 --> 00:01:37,338
Was that...?
That actually sounded like a...

26
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,141
- Was that a pick-up line?
- No.

27
00:01:39,282 --> 00:01:41,512
- No.
- That... I apologize.

28
00:01:41,651 --> 00:01:43,278
Okay.

29
00:01:44,587 --> 00:01:46,020
Besides, I would...

30
00:01:46,923 --> 00:01:48,914
I would give a better pick-up line
than that.

31
00:01:55,999 --> 00:01:58,297
- Hello, hello.
- I'm not into this.

32
00:01:58,935 --> 00:02:01,096
The bug needs stimulation.
I'm the pediatrician.

33
00:02:01,237 --> 00:02:03,228
It's my area. Hello, little one.

34
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,897
Hello.

35
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,702
Hey, guys, I'm stimulating the bug.

36
00:02:06,843 --> 00:02:08,811
- We've made a decision.
- Together?

37
00:02:08,945 --> 00:02:10,503
Paternity test. Now.

38
00:02:10,647 --> 00:02:13,480
One of us gets out of your hair.
The other one has a right to know.

39
00:02:13,616 --> 00:02:14,878
- Look, guys...
- You know what?

40
00:02:15,018 --> 00:02:16,315
You moved in, you pushed us out,

41
00:02:16,452 --> 00:02:18,579
you've claimed your territory,
but one thing is clear:

42
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:21,383
This kid you're talking to is not your kid,
so stay out of it.

43
00:02:21,524 --> 00:02:24,084
- Look, Pete...
- The answer is right there for us to know.

44
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:27,196
We know that you don't wanna face it,
but we do.

45
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:28,922
I've gotta go.

46
00:02:30,867 --> 00:02:33,495
Well, I have no defining exit line.

47
00:02:33,636 --> 00:02:35,069
So...

48
00:02:42,278 --> 00:02:45,770
JILL: They told me it was a carjacking.
- Told you?

49
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:49,180
- You don't remember?
- I remember leaving soccer practice.

50
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:52,311
Parked across campus
in student parking.

51
00:02:52,889 --> 00:02:55,119
Got to my car,
there were people around.

52
00:02:55,258 --> 00:03:00,525
Pulled out my keys,
I heard a noise behind me, and then...

53
00:03:00,663 --> 00:03:01,960
And?

54
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:04,760
That's all I remember.
Woke up in the ambulance.

55
00:03:05,468 --> 00:03:07,402
I love that car.

56
00:03:07,537 --> 00:03:09,027
I love school.

57
00:03:09,172 --> 00:03:10,833
This guy came into my world, and...

58
00:03:11,241 --> 00:03:12,299
Oh, I'm pissed.

59
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,637
I'd like you to see our psychiatrist,
Dr. Turner.

60
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:17,211
Really? Because other than pissed,
I'm okay.

61
00:03:17,347 --> 00:03:19,542
Just do me the favor,
so you stay that way.

62
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,614
You know what'll make me okay?

63
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,644
When they catch this guy.

64
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,487
VIOLET:
No, I just...

65
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,357
- I'm having an anxiety...
- It's like...

66
00:03:33,496 --> 00:03:37,125
- I know, I know it's humiliating...
- I just wanna know what your...

67
00:03:37,267 --> 00:03:41,465
Am I right? I'm right, right? It is...

68
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:44,633
Are you snooping?

69
00:03:44,774 --> 00:03:46,799
This is public space.
I'm just standing here.

70
00:03:46,943 --> 00:03:48,035
Snooping.

71
00:03:48,177 --> 00:03:50,077
- You wanna know what's going on or not?
- I do.

72
00:03:50,213 --> 00:03:51,339
Okay.

73
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:54,882
Possible baby daddies
demanded paternity test.

74
00:03:55,018 --> 00:03:57,145
- Said my name during sex with her.
ADDISON: No.

75
00:03:57,287 --> 00:03:58,345
Okay, wait a minute.

76
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,979
How do you know, just by watching?
What, do you read lips now?

77
00:04:01,124 --> 00:04:04,252
Well, look,
Sam told me the whole name thing.

78
00:04:04,394 --> 00:04:07,386
What? We are friends.
He tells me stuff.

79
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:08,758
We're just friends.

80
00:04:08,898 --> 00:04:12,061
And Violet was yelling so loud. Just...

81
00:04:12,201 --> 00:04:13,896
Oh, God,
he called out your name during...

82
00:04:14,037 --> 00:04:17,598
Oh, I'm the only person that the man
has had sex with in the last 15 years.

83
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:21,471
It was just habit, that's all.
We're just friends.

84
00:04:22,145 --> 00:04:24,909
I wish someone would call out
another name when in bed with me.

85
00:04:25,048 --> 00:04:27,073
I'd take not knowing
who the father of my baby was.

86
00:04:27,216 --> 00:04:30,982
Either way, it would mean that I'd had
a man on top of me in recent history.

87
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,350
- You know what? That's really sad.
- I know.

88
00:04:33,489 --> 00:04:35,218
I thought somebody
was trying to pick me up,

89
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,417
and I felt my knees open just a little bit.

90
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,618
[LAUGHS]

91
00:04:38,761 --> 00:04:41,321
Hey, I don't wanna spoil the fun,
but I've got Betsey with me today

92
00:04:41,464 --> 00:04:43,955
and Say My Name and Who's Your Daddy
are getting a little loud.

93
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,069
I don't wanna have to explain
what paternity test is to my 6 year old.

94
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,636
I'm not telling them to shut up.

95
00:04:48,771 --> 00:04:51,171
Oh, no, no, me neither.

96
00:04:51,674 --> 00:04:54,268
I will have a paternity test
when I wanna have a paternity test.

97
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:57,208
- You can't do one for a few weeks.
- Who do they think they are?

98
00:04:57,347 --> 00:05:00,180
- It's my body. It's my uterus.
- You can't do one for a few weeks.

99
00:05:00,316 --> 00:05:04,650
I mean, yes, I was a little bit irresponsible
having unprotected sex with two men,

100
00:05:04,787 --> 00:05:06,812
- but does that give them the right to...?
- Violet.

101
00:05:07,156 --> 00:05:09,750
You can't do a CVS paternity test
for a few weeks.

102
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:12,156
- The point is mute.
- Moot.

103
00:05:12,996 --> 00:05:14,588
- The point is moot.
- Is it moot?

104
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,894
- No, I'm sure it's mute.
- No, it's moot. The point is moot.

105
00:05:18,034 --> 00:05:19,899
I can't have a paternity test for weeks.

106
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,031
I didn't come here to...

107
00:05:22,171 --> 00:05:23,468
I need you to see a patient.

108
00:05:23,606 --> 00:05:25,801
Is the point moot or is the point mute?

109
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,678
Annie's out of surgery.

110
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,141
Where's the patient?

111
00:05:35,284 --> 00:05:37,548
You were in bed with me
and you called out another name.

112
00:05:37,687 --> 00:05:41,179
I know, and it was wrong,
but I was not thinking about her.

113
00:05:41,324 --> 00:05:43,121
It just slipped out, I promise.

114
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:45,793
- Sonya, please. What are you...?
- Well, I have to go to work.

115
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:48,920
And you've explained yourself
as best you could, I guess.

116
00:05:49,065 --> 00:05:51,465
Have a good day, Sonya.
See? There, Sonya.

117
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,466
See, I said... I know it.
It's a beautiful name.

118
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,468
Sonya. Sonya's a wonder...

[GRUNTS]

120
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:03,172
You're just in the doghouse, you know.
You're just gonna have to suffer.

121
00:06:03,312 --> 00:06:05,177
Just for a little bit.

122
00:06:05,314 --> 00:06:06,838
Maybe I should
make her dinner tonight.

123
00:06:06,983 --> 00:06:09,451
You know, go all out,
candlelight, flowers, the works.

124
00:06:09,585 --> 00:06:11,280
No, no, no, you need to take her out.

125
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:15,255
Take her out somewhere nice,
somewhere romantic.

126
00:06:15,491 --> 00:06:17,391
The Blue Sea in Malibu.

127
00:06:17,527 --> 00:06:19,017
The Blue Sea?
The place we used to go?

128
00:06:19,162 --> 00:06:21,824
Yeah. The place with the great mimosas
that you drank too many of.

129
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:24,592
The Blue Sea.
Yeah, that sounds perfect.

130
00:06:24,734 --> 00:06:28,636
The memory loss is not unusual
and it's not necessarily a bad thing.

131
00:06:28,771 --> 00:06:29,863
You're protecting yourself.

132
00:06:30,006 --> 00:06:32,566
I don't wanna protect myself.
I wanna remember.

133
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:35,506
The memory may come out naturally
when you're ready to deal with it.

134
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:36,703
I'm ready to deal with it.

135
00:06:36,846 --> 00:06:39,940
I wanna help the police find this guy
and I can't unless I remember.

136
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,313
I don't wanna be a victim.

137
00:06:42,452 --> 00:06:44,920
I wanna find this guy
and rip his throat out.

138
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:48,222
Okay.

139
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,489
Close your eyes.

[SIGHS]

141
00:06:56,732 --> 00:06:57,960
Okay.

142
00:06:58,101 --> 00:07:02,003
So I want you to think
about something you like.

143
00:07:02,138 --> 00:07:03,332
Griffith Park.

144
00:07:03,473 --> 00:07:04,531
I like riding horses.

145
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,141
Good.

146
00:07:06,609 --> 00:07:11,308
So I want you to see it in your mind
like you're sitting in a movie theater

147
00:07:11,447 --> 00:07:13,711
watching it on a screen.

148
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,579
Describe what you see.

149
00:07:15,718 --> 00:07:20,587
The horse is chestnut with a white streak
down the side of his neck.

150
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,954
We're riding off the trail up a hill.

151
00:07:24,093 --> 00:07:27,551
Then we cut through some trees,
cantering.

152
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,096
Good.

153
00:07:30,299 --> 00:07:31,527
So you're relaxed.

154
00:07:32,168 --> 00:07:33,465
You're feeling that,

155
00:07:33,603 --> 00:07:37,061
only the picture on the screen
is going to change.

156
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,071
Focus on the screen.

157
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:40,976
You see your car.

158
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,975
You see yourself.

159
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:48,214
- Okay.
- Now, don't bring everything into focus.

160
00:07:48,351 --> 00:07:50,717
And you can look away
any time you need to.

161
00:07:50,853 --> 00:07:53,754
But do you see anything
about the attacker?

162
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,750
His arm.

163
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,192
His hand.

164
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:02,797
He was white. The guy was white.

165
00:08:05,801 --> 00:08:07,325
I can remember this, can't I?

166
00:08:08,504 --> 00:08:10,995
- You can help me remember.
- I'll try.

167
00:08:12,475 --> 00:08:15,239
It always starts with the cramping.

168
00:08:15,645 --> 00:08:18,113
My husband and I
can't go through this again.

169

I think I know why you're cramping.

173
00:08:31,127 --> 00:08:34,255
The placenta is implanting low
on the uterine wall,

174
00:08:34,397 --> 00:08:37,195

as the pregnancy progresses.

We weren't able to remove all of it,

will shrink this tumor,

No.

No, I didn't.

Right now, in my mind,
the baby is the bug.

And I've gotten used to the bug.

679
00:35:47,695 --> 00:35:51,722
I'm actually liking the bug.

680
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:59,165
And I'm afraid if I start seeing it
with a Pete head or a Sheldon head or...

681
00:35:59,307 --> 00:36:02,470
I know myself,
and I know that I'm not ready to do this.

you helped him change his mind?

Charlotte, you did a good thing.

A thing that makes me love you
even more. Why...?

It makes me sick, you loving me.

to my stomach.

00:37:32,233 --> 00:37:34,599
I screwed Archer's brains out
and you forgive it?

Who does that?

00:37:37,104 --> 00:37:40,198

- You need to forgive yourself.

I should do next with Sonya?

What? You were helping me out,
it was fun.

Yeah, that's the problem.

You shouldn't be having fun with me.

I just wanted to tell you
that the first time we talked,

I was just a flattered married guy.
