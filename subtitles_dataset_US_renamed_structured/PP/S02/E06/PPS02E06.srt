You lost weight, you're anemic,
your blood pressure's way too high.

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,089
- This is serious.
- I took all of the pills you gave me.

I lose a little bit more of her.

173

She hasn't been lucid in over a year.

you can look after Frances

175

and take care of yourself.

Oh, no, Sam.

177
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:04,118
I told you,
I'm not gonna put her in a nursing home.

178
00:10:04,587 --> 00:10:08,023
I promised her that I wouldn't years ago.
We promised each other.

179

Circumstances were different then.

- Sam, I promised her.

181
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:18,395
When she dies, she dies in my arms.
Not with strangers, in my arms.

182
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,465
She's the love of my life.

183
00:10:21,604 --> 00:10:26,132
I will not put the love of my life

184

- No, Addison, wait.
- Hi there.

186
00:10:39,422 --> 00:10:42,323
Thank you for seeing us so last minute.
Daniel pulled me out of class.

187
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,653
He said we had to have
an ultrasound today.

188
00:10:44,794 --> 00:10:46,659
- I was trying to warn you.
AMY: I have an OB,

189
00:10:46,796 --> 00:10:48,661
but Daniel said you were the best.

190
00:10:48,798 --> 00:10:52,564
- I'm sorry, Miss?
- This is Amy, my wife.

You have two wives?
He has two wives. Did you know that?

192
00:10:58,107 --> 00:11:02,100
- No. Daniel...
- I didn't plan for this to happen.

193
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:04,769
I've been happily married to Amy
for 12 years.

194
00:11:05,147 --> 00:11:09,243
But then three years ago, I met Laura.
We fell in love.

195
00:11:09,385 --> 00:11:12,411
- Do they know about each other?
- Please, you can't say anything.

196
00:11:12,555 --> 00:11:14,113
It's a pretty dumb move

to the same medical practice.

198
00:11:16,826 --> 00:11:19,727
When you found the abnormality, I worried
Amy's doctors missed something.

199
00:11:19,862 --> 00:11:21,090
Due date's around the corner.

200
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:24,688
I couldn't risk something going wrong
with her delivery, with our baby.

201
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:28,133
I should throw you out of here.
I should, but I won't.

202
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,534
I'll do the ultrasound
because your wife, that wife,

203
00:11:30,673 --> 00:11:32,664
and her unborn child
are the victims here.

204
00:11:32,808 --> 00:11:36,039
I'm doing it for them, not you.
Let me be clear about that.

205
00:11:45,888 --> 00:11:48,789
So, Amy, you're a teacher?

We want a big family.

- I didn't, I didn't. They guessed.

You don't have a right to be mad.

and I did a spontaneous thing,

that was done about ten years ago

328
00:18:57,686 --> 00:18:59,210
in which a spinal tap was performed

329
00:18:59,354 --> 00:19:02,346
to drain the excess fluid off of patients
with NPH.

330
00:19:02,491 --> 00:19:04,391
Now, if she has this,

331
00:19:04,526 --> 00:19:08,462
the tap could relieve the symptoms
and give her a few brief periods of clarity.

332
00:19:08,597 --> 00:19:10,929
- Well, that's a big if, Naomi.
- It's worth a try.

333
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,465
The only blessing of this disease

334
00:19:12,601 --> 00:19:15,900
is that she's not cognizant enough
to understand her own situation.

Want her to understand
how bad things are?

I want her to understand
how bad things are for Henry.

337
00:19:20,709 --> 00:19:22,677
So then you'd put her
through a spinal tap?

338

If this were me,
if this were you and me...

This is not you and me.

340
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:31,747
- I know that.
- This is a shot in the dark, Naomi.

The Frances I knew would not
have wanted this for either of them.

342
00:19:34,723 --> 00:19:36,486

who can convince Henry

there was something between you

and I don't wanna know her.

492
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:24,405
Look, Amy,
you're both hurting right now,

493
00:29:24,546 --> 00:29:27,037
but maybe you can help each other
work through this.

494
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,774
Damn it!

495
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:35,082

Thank you, Helen.

- How do you feel, Frances?
- What?

500
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,633
Are you? Where's the music?

501
00:29:53,775 --> 00:29:56,437
I thought

SAM:
She's gonna be fine. The worst is over.

503
00:29:59,414 --> 00:30:01,939
Oh, look at her.
I never should've put her through this.

504
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:06,286
This may work, Henry.
And it could give you at least something.

505
00:30:06,421 --> 00:30:09,413
If only I can talk with her,
even for a minute.

506

Look into her eyes
and know that she sees me,

507
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,420
really sees me.

508
00:30:20,034 --> 00:30:24,095
Okay, Amy,
you're about eight centimeters dilated.

509
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,833
- How are you feeling?
- Daniel was supposed to be here.

510
00:30:26,975 --> 00:30:29,842
- If you want me to, I'll call him.
- I don't wanna see him.

511
00:30:29,978 --> 00:30:31,240
But I don't wanna be alone.

512
00:30:39,053 --> 00:30:41,920
You haven't told Cooper the truth yet.

513
00:30:42,056 --> 00:30:45,025
You're not very good at letting things go,
are you?

514
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:48,790
You know what I think?
I think you're scared.

515
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:49,988
Of what?

516
00:30:50,131 --> 00:30:52,793
I think this relationship is getting real,

517
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:56,165
so you're just as scared as Cooper is,
so you're trying to sabotage it.

518
00:30:56,304 --> 00:30:59,967
Take a new job, rent the floor under him,
keep it from him.

519
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:03,737
You want this to blow up in your face.

520
00:31:04,479 --> 00:31:06,470
You know what I think?

521
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:08,809
I think you're not half the shrink
you think you are.

522
00:31:13,922 --> 00:31:17,858
- Where are you going?
- To tell Cooper the truth.

523
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:26,858
- Why isn't she responding?
- We knew we could only try, Henry.

524
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:35,303
Frances, remember the day
last November when we were at home?

525
00:31:36,044 --> 00:31:40,071
It was raining and cold.
You were reading in your chair.

526
00:31:40,214 --> 00:31:42,045
I saw you shivering,

527
00:31:42,183 --> 00:31:45,016
and I asked you
if you wanted me to turn the heat up,

528
00:31:45,353 --> 00:31:47,913
and you smiled, and you said yes.

529
00:31:48,056 --> 00:31:51,219
So I went downstairs
and turned the thermostat up.

530
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:55,420
And when I came back up,
I told you I had done it.

531
00:31:55,563 --> 00:31:56,757
But you didn't know me.

532
00:31:57,966 --> 00:31:59,524
That was the last time we spoke.

533
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:03,228
Please don't let that
be our last memory together.

534
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:07,865
- We need a new memory.
- This is too hard for him.

535
00:32:10,044 --> 00:32:13,775
Frances, it's me, Helen.

536
00:32:13,915 --> 00:32:17,009
Your husband is here,
and he needs your help.

537

You need to do this for him.

I'm sorry, Henry.

539
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:26,850
I'm so sorry there wasn't more
that we could do for her.

HENRY: You're here and now.
That's what's important.

544
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:47,943

- You look so tired.

545

I've missed you.
I've missed you every day.

546
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,409
Frances, Henry promised you

547
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:56,250
that he would never put you
in a nursing home.

548
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:59,827

- Yeah.

You'll visit me every day.

You promise me that, Henry.

And then you'll let me go.

- Uh-huh.

659
00:39:49,336 --> 00:39:53,739
- What about Violet?
- She was worried about us coming out,

660
00:39:54,175 --> 00:39:55,733
but I took care of it.

661
00:39:55,876 --> 00:39:57,468
That's it?

662
00:39:58,712 --> 00:40:00,407
She's happy for me.

663
00:40:01,549 --> 00:40:03,244
For us.

664
00:40:07,421 --> 00:40:09,321
Wow.

665
00:40:10,391 --> 00:40:12,916
Guess I misjudged her.

666
00:40:14,462 --> 00:40:17,022
[DOORBELL RINGS]

667
00:40:25,139 --> 00:40:28,905
- Did you bring your squad car?
- I need an explanation, Addison.

668
00:40:29,977 --> 00:40:32,411
I cheated on my husband.

669
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:34,913
With his best friend.

670
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:39,576
And after that,

671
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,654
my ex-husband cheated on me too.

672
00:40:41,789 --> 00:40:46,852
So when you said, "I love you,"

673
00:40:47,261 --> 00:40:50,890
it took everything
to this whole other place.

674
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:55,593
This dark place
where the stakes were high.

675
00:40:57,538 --> 00:41:01,304
Couldn't trust you. Not because of you.

676
00:41:01,909 --> 00:41:03,604
Because of me.

677
00:41:05,746 --> 00:41:10,240
And I think I was scared
because I do like you.

678
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:14,411
I like you a lot, Kevin.

679
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:20,425
And I am not in a place
where I can say what you said.

680
00:41:21,162 --> 00:41:24,393
But I think if you were to stick around
a little while,

681
00:41:24,532 --> 00:41:26,397
I might be able to get there.

682
00:41:26,534 --> 00:41:30,994
Because you are honest and loyal

683
00:41:32,006 --> 00:41:33,564
and worthy of trust.

684
00:41:46,787 --> 00:41:48,721
I messed up.

685
00:42:07,007 --> 00:42:08,907
But I think

686
00:42:09,476 --> 00:42:10,773
I might get there.
