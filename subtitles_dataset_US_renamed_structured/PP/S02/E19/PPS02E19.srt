It wasn't easy. I wasn't easy.

right meds to get my delusions in check,

and then when I got pregnant
and needed to go off of them...

140
00:06:52,962 --> 00:06:55,487
It's funny.
My life was on hold for so long,

00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:28,450
VIOLET:
I know this is hard to hear...

170
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,559
No, no, no,
I can feel her moving right now.

171
00:08:30,693 --> 00:08:33,184
- Why don't we talk this through?
- No, no, she's still alive.

172
00:08:33,329 --> 00:08:34,921
I know it.

173
00:08:45,641 --> 00:08:48,735
Katie's not answering her cell phone.
I called, but Katie hasn't come home.

174
00:08:48,878 --> 00:08:51,972
Well, we've gotta find her.
We don't know how long ago the fetus died.

175
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:54,981
- The decaying tissue could lead to sepsis.
- She needs a D and C.

176
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:58,109
You can't perform a D and C on a woman
who still thinks her baby's alive.

177
00:08:58,254 --> 00:09:01,348
- Maybe her body will pass the tissue.
- No, it's dangerous to wait for that.

178
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:03,617
This baby represents everything
that she has overcome.

179
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:06,057
If I can talk to her,
separate that from the baby...

180
00:09:06,195 --> 00:09:08,254
And what if you can't?
She saw the monitor.

181
00:09:08,397 --> 00:09:10,092
No heartbeat, and she didn't believe it.

182
00:09:10,233 --> 00:09:12,064
- I'll get her to understand.
ADDISON: Good.

183
00:09:12,835 --> 00:09:15,668
Find her, talk to her,
but, you know, do it fast.

184
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,975
- Hey. Good game yesterday.
- Hey.

185
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,839
How come we never went
when we were married?

186
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:26,244
That's what Bryce was saying.
Said he'd never seen you around.

187
00:09:26,382 --> 00:09:29,146
The guy with the smile
and the nice teeth?

188
00:09:29,285 --> 00:09:31,515
- Yeah, Bryce.
- He was asking about me?

189
00:09:32,922 --> 00:09:35,288
- Did you want him to be asking about you?
- Well, maybe.

190
00:09:36,225 --> 00:09:38,523
Well, yeah. Yeah, he's cute.

191
00:09:39,262 --> 00:09:40,490
Yeah.

192
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,359
Yeah, he's real cute.

193
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,022
Yeah.

194
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,634
- So, Samuel...
- You're gonna ask me to call Bryce.

195
00:09:49,772 --> 00:09:51,706
Oh, please, please.

196
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,331
Just give him my number.

197
00:09:53,476 --> 00:09:57,071
I mean, I need some fun, you know.
I need some post-Archer fun.

198
00:09:57,213 --> 00:09:59,113
Yeah. Sure. Fine.

199
00:09:59,248 --> 00:10:00,306
- Really?
- Yeah.

200
00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:02,041
Oh, you are so sweet.

201
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:05,881
- You are the best ex-husband ever.
- I am.

202
00:10:07,256 --> 00:10:10,054
- She's in a good mood.
- That's because I'm pimping for her.

203
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,490
- I'm pimping for my ex-wife.
- Pimping?

204
00:10:12,628 --> 00:10:14,596
- I'm setting her up with Bryce.
- Bryce?

205
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,254
- That's what I said.
- What the...?

206
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,424
Why did I say
that I would set her up with Bryce?

207
00:10:18,567 --> 00:10:19,659
I don't know.

208
00:10:19,802 --> 00:10:21,360
Thank you.

209
00:10:25,074 --> 00:10:26,871
What is it?

210
00:10:27,677 --> 00:10:29,338
Cancer. It's cancer.

211
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,512
I'm sorry, Brandon.

212
00:10:31,647 --> 00:10:32,978
Am I gonna die?

213
00:10:33,115 --> 00:10:34,548
You're not gonna die.

214
00:10:34,684 --> 00:10:37,278
You're gonna fight this, okay?
We're gonna fight it.

215
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,888
So, what's next? What can we do?

216
00:10:40,022 --> 00:10:42,923
Well, we'll run a few more tests
to stage the cancer.

217
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,027
Depending on how advanced it is,

218
00:10:45,161 --> 00:10:49,188
we can determine
the best course of treatment.

219
00:10:49,332 --> 00:10:50,993
Chemo, radiation, surgery.

220
00:10:51,133 --> 00:10:53,158
BRANDON: I can't believe this.
I've been sick my whole life.

221
00:10:53,302 --> 00:10:55,532
I thought I was finally done with it.

222
00:10:55,671 --> 00:10:58,401
I'm 22 years old. I don't smoke.

223
00:10:58,541 --> 00:10:59,940
How did I get a tumor in my throat?

224
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:04,069
Well, the biopsy was positive for HPV,
which is human papilloma virus.

225
00:11:04,213 --> 00:11:06,340
- I thought that was an STD.
COOPER: It is.

226
00:11:06,482 --> 00:11:09,280
But it can cause abnormal cell growth
which can lead to cancer.

227
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:10,578
Oh, my God.

228
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,047
BRANDON: It's okay.
- No, I have HPV.

229
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,559
I caused your cancer.

230
00:11:21,397 --> 00:11:23,262
They all have a little thing up here...

231
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:24,525
BETSEY: Hi, Mommy.
- Hi.

232
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:27,295
Daddy can't draw a horse,
but he's taking me riding.

233
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,199
Wow, that's great.

234
00:11:29,338 --> 00:11:33,138
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
Baby, just stay here and draw, okay?

235
00:11:37,847 --> 00:11:39,212
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

236
00:11:39,348 --> 00:11:41,578
No, everything's good.
Really good, actually.

237
00:11:41,717 --> 00:11:44,447
- I got a promotion.
- Oh, well, that's great.

238
00:11:44,587 --> 00:11:46,316
The promotion is in St. Louis.

239
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:48,252
She would have better schools.

240
00:11:48,391 --> 00:11:51,087
She could play in a front yard
without cars flying by.

241
00:11:51,227 --> 00:11:52,956
Which one makes up
for losing her father?

242
00:11:53,095 --> 00:11:56,030
I know I'm asking a lot,
but I want us to talk about this...

243
00:11:56,165 --> 00:11:58,633
No, this is what you said
when I wanted to pursue custody.

244
00:11:58,768 --> 00:12:00,998
You said we'd talk, work it out,
that I'd be involved.

245
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,536
I want you to be involved.

246
00:12:02,671 --> 00:12:04,536
- Vacation, holidays...
- No.

247
00:12:04,673 --> 00:12:06,334
Listen, Dell. It's a fresh start, okay?

248
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,909
Away from here,
away from all the bad stuff.

249
00:12:09,044 --> 00:12:10,306
Look at my picture, Mommy.

250
00:12:10,446 --> 00:12:11,879
Wow, that's beautiful.

251
00:12:12,014 --> 00:12:14,448
Hey, can you go grab your sweater,
sweetie?

252
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,619
Go if you want, but Betsey stays.
You can't take her.

253
00:12:17,753 --> 00:12:19,084
Don't do this, Dell.

254
00:12:19,221 --> 00:12:21,485
You asked me to get it together, I have.

255
00:12:21,624 --> 00:12:22,818
This is good for her.

256
00:12:24,593 --> 00:12:25,787
Ready? Let's go. Come on.

257
00:12:37,239 --> 00:12:39,264
Unbelievable.

258
00:12:40,075 --> 00:12:41,099
Wow.

259
00:12:41,243 --> 00:12:44,371
Late night, now lunch.

260
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,981
I try to utilize all aspects of the day.

261
00:12:47,116 --> 00:12:50,449
- But you? Work, work, work.
NOAH: Addison.

262
00:12:52,154 --> 00:12:54,679
Noah. Hey, this is Pete.

263
00:12:54,824 --> 00:12:56,553
Dr. Pete Wilder.

264
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:59,388
Noah's wife is a patient of mine.

265
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:05,193
Oh, well,
I'll see you back at the practice.

266
00:13:07,136 --> 00:13:09,297
So I just got Morgan's labs back.

267
00:13:09,438 --> 00:13:11,133
She's responding to cephalosporin.

268
00:13:14,677 --> 00:13:18,169
I'm just gonna say this
even though I shouldn't, even though...

269
00:13:18,314 --> 00:13:21,909
Well, you know, you marry someone
and you think it's love, you want it to be.

270
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,815
You wanna be a good man,
you wanna be the kind of man who...

271
00:13:27,923 --> 00:13:31,017
But I've never felt for a woman
the way I feel about you.

272
00:13:32,361 --> 00:13:35,330
And I know you feel it too. I know it.

273
00:13:35,464 --> 00:13:37,523
And I would never ask you to admit it,

274
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:41,727
but I need to feel at least
like I'm not crazy in this.

275
00:13:41,871 --> 00:13:46,035
That it's not just me
making up something in my own head

276
00:13:46,175 --> 00:13:48,109
so I'm not so ashamed.

277
00:13:52,715 --> 00:13:58,119
I have to get these lab results
back to Morgan.

278
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:06,255
I didn't think HPV
had any effect on men.

279
00:14:06,395 --> 00:14:08,454
And we use condoms.
We're always safe.

280
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:12,533
Well, women get cervical infections
and men...

281
00:14:13,035 --> 00:14:14,696
People don't think of oral sex as sex.

282
00:14:15,304 --> 00:14:17,067
LYLA:
Oh, God, I didn't know.

283
00:14:17,206 --> 00:14:19,470
I didn't tell you because I didn't...

284
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:20,939
I didn't think it could hurt you.

285
00:14:21,076 --> 00:14:22,270
You must really hate me.

286
00:14:22,411 --> 00:14:24,572
No, baby, I love you.

287
00:14:25,581 --> 00:14:28,175
We're gonna fight this together,
remember?

288
00:14:28,317 --> 00:14:29,375
Yeah.

289
00:14:31,053 --> 00:14:32,452
So that's good.

290
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,490
- Right, honey?
- Right.

291
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:42,393
Morgan, I was thinking it might be worth
considering having a hospital-based doctor

292
00:14:42,531 --> 00:14:44,294
to monitor the rest of your pregnancy.

293
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,825
- You wanna drop me as a patient?
- No.

294
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:51,599
It's just I have such a heavy patient load
and it's often difficult for me to get here.

295
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,732
- I could find you a great doctor right here.
- I understand you're busy.

296
00:14:54,877 --> 00:14:57,311
I live with a doctor, I get it.

297
00:14:57,446 --> 00:14:58,811
I just...

298
00:14:59,348 --> 00:15:00,872
- I thought we were friends.
- Morgan...

299
00:15:01,016 --> 00:15:03,541
I mean, who else is gonna take
my mind off my anxiety

300
00:15:03,686 --> 00:15:05,449
by telling me about their sex life?

301
00:15:06,388 --> 00:15:09,983
- I just want you to have the best care.
- Addison.

302
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:13,754
Really. So I'm going to send over
a list of names, okay? I'm sorry.

303
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:28,533
[KNOCKING]

304
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,167
Got a minute? You waiting on a call?

305
00:15:30,312 --> 00:15:31,779
No, no.

306
00:15:31,914 --> 00:15:34,781
I was gonna make one, or not.

307
00:15:34,917 --> 00:15:36,282
It's Bryce. I can't do it.

308
00:15:36,418 --> 00:15:39,046
Brandon's test results are back.
Stage four.

309
00:15:39,588 --> 00:15:42,819
- Cancer's spread to the mandible bone.
- Stage four.

310
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,825
Yeah, so we do chemo and radiation,
see if we can attack it.

311
00:15:45,961 --> 00:15:48,122
I'd go for the surgery, right?
Resect the mandible.

312
00:15:48,263 --> 00:15:50,231
- Odds are better.
- Know what surgery would do?

313
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,799
Well, yeah. It could save his life.

314
00:15:51,934 --> 00:15:56,530
You want him to lose part of his jaw,
wind up disfigured, drooling?

315
00:15:56,672 --> 00:15:58,162
His life comes first, Coop.

316
00:15:58,307 --> 00:16:01,606
I realize that surgery may feel preemptive,
but chances are he's gonna get there.

317
00:16:01,744 --> 00:16:04,804
His life is important to me,
his whole life.

318
00:16:04,947 --> 00:16:06,812
He's coming in tomorrow
to talk treatments.

319
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:10,885
If we can tell him chemo and radiation,
there's some hope of a normal life there.

320
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,817
I wanna give him some hope.

321
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:20,426
Do men not understand
the concept of a phone?

322
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:24,020
You know, how to pick it up
and to dial it, you know.

323
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,895
I mean, I'm out there.
I am sowing my oats...

324
00:16:26,035 --> 00:16:29,232
Heather wants to move to Missouri
and she wants to take Betsey.

325
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,330
Oh, God, Dell, that's awful.

326
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:36,769
You know, I pushed her to get better,
and now she has this opportunity,

327
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,174
and it's gonna be my fault.

328
00:16:38,313 --> 00:16:40,474
Hey. Dell. Dell.

329
00:16:40,616 --> 00:16:43,210
This is not your fault.

330
00:16:43,352 --> 00:16:45,377
God, when Sam and I
were going through our divorce,

331
00:16:45,521 --> 00:16:48,786
it never occurred to me
that he would be absent from Maya's life.

332
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:51,893
I'd never want to jeopardize that
for Maya.

333
00:16:52,027 --> 00:16:53,892
I know. How can she think

"What would Dr. Turner say?"

She would say,
"Step back, look at the situation."

another ultrasound.

I can handle the chemo and radiation.

I'm so worried about Lyla.
She feels so awful, you know.

Oh, my God.

COOPER:
Okay.

512
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:11,512
It's okay. He's okay.

513
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:12,779
Sam's stopping the bleeding.

514
00:26:12,921 --> 00:26:14,479
Come on. He's gonna be okay, okay?

515
00:26:14,623 --> 00:26:18,457
I should never have let him go alone.
God, I should have known better.

516
00:26:18,593 --> 00:26:20,527
Thank you for calling me.

517
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:23,597
So the tumor is up
against the carotid artery.

518
00:26:23,732 --> 00:26:26,633
Now, the surgeon is afraid
that at the rate that the tumor is growing,

519
00:26:26,768 --> 00:26:30,033
that it will erode into the artery
and cause a massive bleed.

520
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:32,696
- What does that mean?
- Brandon needs surgery very quickly.

521
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,138
- Oh, what about the chemo?
- No.

522
00:26:34,276 --> 00:26:36,244
Resecting the tumor is our only option.

523
00:26:36,378 --> 00:26:39,609
- We're gonna remove a portion of his jaw...
- No, no, no, he doesn't want surgery.

524
00:26:40,582 --> 00:26:41,674
I'm sorry.

525
00:26:44,953 --> 00:26:46,944
Maybe we've been focusing too much
on the baby

526
00:26:47,088 --> 00:26:50,615
and not enough on everything
that allowed you to get to this point.

527
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:55,196
Well, it's hard to separate me from her,
but okay, I'll try.

528
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:57,798
Great. Maybe start with your mom.

529
00:26:57,932 --> 00:27:02,335
When she died
it was like a pit opened up.

530
00:27:02,737 --> 00:27:06,070
And that's when everything started.

531
00:27:06,775 --> 00:27:09,903
I was so convinced they killed her,
the doctors.

532
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,479
- But now you know.
- Oh, yeah, that was crazy.

533
00:27:13,148 --> 00:27:15,673
I mean, I thought someone
was plotting to steal her casket.

534
00:27:15,817 --> 00:27:17,341
I went to the cemetery to guard it.

535
00:27:17,485 --> 00:27:20,579
- But was that your fault?
- No, no, but...

536
00:27:20,922 --> 00:27:23,857
Oh, God, why are we going...?
Why are we going here again?

537
00:27:23,992 --> 00:27:25,084
We got through this.

538
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:26,989
We got past this a long time ago.

539
00:27:27,128 --> 00:27:28,755
Right, but not everyone does.

Not everyone fights
to get their life back the way you did.

- It's impressive.
- And now the baby.

Well, regardless of the baby, Katie,
you've done amazing things.

No.

Could you get Addison, now?

553
00:28:07,535 --> 00:28:09,935
- What happened?
- She's showing early signs of sepsis.

554
00:28:10,071 --> 00:28:12,631
I gave her antibiotics,
but we need to do a D and C.

What is it? What's happening?

556
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:18,602
Katie, I know this is not
what you wanna hear,

557
00:28:18,747 --> 00:28:21,045
but what happened yesterday
was not a mistake.

558
00:28:21,182 --> 00:28:23,548
Your baby died,
and it's making you very, very sick.

559
00:28:23,685 --> 00:28:26,483
It's morning sickness.
We could go back to your office.

560
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:29,112
- You can make me feel better.
- Katie, I wish we could.

561
00:28:29,257 --> 00:28:31,725
But what Violet is telling you
is what's really happening.

562
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,885
And we need to remove
the fetal tissue now.

00:28:34,028 --> 00:28:35,791
Listen to me, my baby's fine.

564
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:38,660
You don't have my permission,
you can't do anything. I wanna get out.

565
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,825
It's all right. Katie, Katie, it's all right.

566
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,767
Let me talk to them.
We'll straighten it out, okay?

567
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:50,810
Violet, look, she's pale,
she's got a fever.

568
00:28:50,945 --> 00:28:52,845
If we don't get that tissue out,
she could die.

569
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,380
We cannot do this against her will.

570
00:28:54,516 --> 00:28:56,416
Yes, you can.
You can declare her incompetent.

571
00:28:56,551 --> 00:28:58,246
She's unable to make decisions
for herself.

572
00:28:58,386 --> 00:29:02,755
If we force this on her, if we take out
what she believes is a live baby,

573
00:29:02,891 --> 00:29:04,119
she will never recover.

574
00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:05,521
It will break her.

00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,525
Look, she needs a D and C, I get it.

576
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:10,529
But I have to get her to accept
that her baby is dead before you do it.

577
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:14,499
- Violet, you've tried. She can't accept it.
- If you don't wanna, you don't have to.

578
00:29:14,636 --> 00:29:17,628
Pete and I can declare this
an emergent situation. We'll override her.

579
00:29:17,772 --> 00:29:19,603
- You mean override me.

No. No, this is my call.

581

- Lyla. Hey. Hey, what happened?

half of his jaw removed.

00:29:42,163 --> 00:29:47,863
And maybe it's horrible,
but I'm just supposed to be okay with that?

586
00:29:48,403 --> 00:29:51,133
Every time I look at him
knowing that I did this?

587
00:29:51,272 --> 00:29:53,638
- No, no, he does not blame you.
- I blame me.

588
00:29:53,775 --> 00:29:56,608
He spent his entire life
trying to get his face fixed,

589
00:29:56,744 --> 00:30:00,043
- and then he meets me and...
- Look, hey, I get that you're hurting.

590
00:30:00,181 --> 00:30:01,478
But he loves you and...

591

Don't say that.

Don't make me feel worse,
because I know it's selfish...

and you wanna run.

that you love,

596
00:30:17,499 --> 00:30:19,433
it is hard to find.

597
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:21,561

My cancer patient Brandon
has to have a portion of his jaw removed,

607
00:31:04,812 --> 00:31:06,780
and his girlfriend dumped him.

608
00:31:06,915 --> 00:31:10,146
She felt guilty for making him sick,
so she dumped him.

609
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,048
Sounds like she's a real prize.

610
00:31:12,186 --> 00:31:13,483

she was making a mistake.

You've got any ideas?

613
00:31:20,194 --> 00:31:23,891
Nothing you can say is gonna make
someone do something they don't want to.

614

- Brandon needs her.
- Brandon wants her.

run out on him when the going gets tough.

and you don't look like you feel well.

- I don't.
- Do you think it's more than the fear?

- What do you mean?
- I mean...

627
00:31:57,031 --> 00:32:01,161
I think maybe deep down, you're scared
because you do know something's wrong.

628

And all of us, when we don't know
what's wrong, we get scared.

something's wrong can help me,

- Get out.

- Yeah.

00:32:44,445 --> 00:32:46,140
It was purely a professional visit.

- He wants me to keep seeing his wife.
- Purely professional.

Well, he may have some feelings
for me,

he's willing to put those aside.

putting your feelings aside.

00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,452
What?

You want Violet to let you in,
you want her to do the ultrasound,

What's going on with you?

What good does it do to face
something you can't have?

649
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,371
- There's a baby.
- That might not be mine.

650
00:33:10,505 --> 00:33:12,530
You're right.
It might not be, but maybe it is.

651
00:33:12,674 --> 00:33:15,438
So I should get invested now
and then have her take all that away?

- She's still in the birthing suite.

00:34:31,452 --> 00:34:33,977
You said you have a daughter.
Is she here?

668
00:34:34,956 --> 00:34:36,014
No.

669
00:34:40,061 --> 00:34:42,757
This was supposed to be a good day.

670
00:34:43,765 --> 00:34:47,326
I was supposed to see her,
my daughter, but...

671
00:34:48,269 --> 00:34:49,531
But they wouldn't let me.

672
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:53,698
What?

673
00:34:55,877 --> 00:34:58,175
I've had a crappy day too.

674
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:05,111
I went to my daughter's apartment
to talk to her mom.

675
00:35:05,253 --> 00:35:07,187
They were gone.

676
00:35:07,588 --> 00:35:09,647
Moved out. Her mother took her away.

677
00:35:10,658 --> 00:35:13,593
I've been making calls
and trying to figure out what to do,

678
00:35:13,728 --> 00:35:17,027
but the thing is,
I don't think I can get her back.

679
00:35:17,398 --> 00:35:19,866
- So...
- I'm so sorry.

680
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:25,797
I know what it's like to want to believe
that it's gonna work out,

681
00:35:27,642 --> 00:35:30,202
but sometimes
you need to face the truth.

682
00:35:31,312 --> 00:35:32,370
Your baby's gone.

683
00:35:34,849 --> 00:35:37,647
And she's not coming back
no matter how much you wanna believe it.

684
00:35:38,252 --> 00:35:41,016
I love her so much.

685
00:35:42,156 --> 00:35:43,384
It scares me.

686
00:35:43,524 --> 00:35:47,153
I think maybe
that's why my stomach hurts so much.

687
00:35:47,295 --> 00:35:50,822
I know you love her,
but the pain in your stomach is real.

688
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,058
No.

689
00:35:55,203 --> 00:35:57,068
[GRUNTING]

690
00:36:00,007 --> 00:36:01,668
VIOLET:
Okay. Shh.

691
00:36:03,611 --> 00:36:07,172
You know Dell is right, don't you?

692
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,781
She didn't survive.

693
00:36:21,162 --> 00:36:22,220
You're gonna be okay.

694
00:36:24,131 --> 00:36:25,428
So will you.

695
00:36:35,643 --> 00:36:38,771
So Dr. Pape said
that you didn't schedule your surgery.

696
00:36:38,913 --> 00:36:39,971
Lyla can't take it.

697
00:36:40,681 --> 00:36:44,412
She can't take it if the HPV makes me
lose half my face, so I need to try chemo.

698
00:36:44,552 --> 00:36:46,417
- Brandon...
- I can't.

699
00:36:46,554 --> 00:36:48,522
I'm not gonna go back.

700
00:36:49,724 --> 00:36:51,988
I'm not gonna be the freak again.

701
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,618
- She's the one.
- She's not the one.

702
00:36:54,762 --> 00:36:56,787
If Lyla was the one,
she would not walk away.

703
00:36:56,931 --> 00:36:58,956
- There will be other women.
- Without a jaw?

704
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,467
Without the surgery, you're gonna die.

705
00:37:02,603 --> 00:37:04,127
I don't want that life again.

706
00:37:04,272 --> 00:37:07,366
I don't wanna be that guy again.

707
00:37:08,576 --> 00:37:12,342
So afraid of what everyone might think

708
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,449
that I can't even
string a sentence together.

709
00:37:17,618 --> 00:37:20,246
- Can't you find another way?
- The way is surgery.

710
00:37:20,388 --> 00:37:22,219
It will save your life.

711
00:37:23,591 --> 00:37:25,320
And we can't do any better than that.

712
00:37:33,734 --> 00:37:34,792
Okay.

713
00:37:37,805 --> 00:37:39,204
Okay.

714
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:46,706
I just... I just wanted it so badly.

715
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:48,178
I know.

716
00:38:09,503 --> 00:38:10,629
I think it's a little lower.

717
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:13,500
Sorry.

718
00:38:27,855 --> 00:38:30,187
- It's...
- It's a boy.

719
00:38:45,306 --> 00:38:48,537
- Ooh.
- Hey, how do I look?

720
00:38:48,676 --> 00:38:52,578
Look good, hot, slutty?

721
00:38:53,481 --> 00:38:55,608
Oh, uh... Definitely hot.

722
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,308
- Having dinner with Bryce.
- Oh, see?

723
00:38:57,451 --> 00:38:59,817
Yeah, he called. I knew he would.

724
00:38:59,954 --> 00:39:01,148
- So you've got Maya?
- Yes.

725
00:39:01,288 --> 00:39:05,224
I have Maya. So you go
and you do your thing with the oats.

726
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:07,190
- With the what?
- The oats.

727
00:39:07,328 --> 00:39:09,353
Oh, sow my oats, yes.

728
00:39:09,497 --> 00:39:10,657
Yeah, yes.

729
00:39:10,798 --> 00:39:12,163
Thank you.

730
00:39:12,299 --> 00:39:13,994
- Thank you for calling him.
- Sure.

731
00:39:14,135 --> 00:39:16,194
You know, you look a little slutty.

732
00:39:16,337 --> 00:39:20,774
- But maybe if you change, just cover up...
- Oh, whoa, no, no, no, slutty's good.

733
00:39:21,308 --> 00:39:23,299
You know, for sowing oats,
slutty is very good.

734
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:27,005
- I'm not trying to get a husband. I'm just...
- I got it. You don't have to elaborate.

735
00:39:27,148 --> 00:39:28,740
Cool. Then you look very slutty.

736
00:39:29,817 --> 00:39:31,182
Thank you.

737
00:39:39,894 --> 00:39:40,952
Damn.

738
00:39:46,834 --> 00:39:49,302
I can't even breathe anymore.

739
00:39:53,607 --> 00:39:55,632
What are you doing?

740
00:39:55,776 --> 00:39:58,142
What the hell's it look like?
I'm painting her nails.

741
00:39:58,279 --> 00:40:00,679
This isn't right, you two together.

742
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:04,251
- You begged me to be nice to her.
- You told me to stop calling her names.

743
00:40:04,385 --> 00:40:07,320
Yes, and I'm glad you're friends,
and I'm glad you're both in my life.

744
00:40:07,455 --> 00:40:09,423
It's hard to find one good woman.
I found two.

745
00:40:09,557 --> 00:40:10,649
Then what's the problem?

746
00:40:10,791 --> 00:40:12,725
Well, my girlfriend life
and my best friend life,

747
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:17,559
they're colliding in a womanly-woman fest
of nail polish and bonding.

748
00:40:17,698 --> 00:40:20,633
You know what?
I'm gonna go drink with guys.

749
00:40:20,768 --> 00:40:24,397
You, I will talk to you in the morning,
and I will tie your shoes, make your lunch,

750
00:40:24,538 --> 00:40:25,630
talk about babies and boy.

751
00:40:25,773 --> 00:40:27,673
[WHISPERS] And you
I'll see later at your place for sex.

752
00:40:27,808 --> 00:40:29,366
Lots and lots of sex.

753
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,604
- But for now, I'm just gonna go.
- You're actually leaving?

754
00:40:32,746 --> 00:40:35,146
You know, one woman at a time
is all I can handle.

755
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,283
One woman at a time.

756
00:40:48,562 --> 00:40:50,621
Dr. Montgomery.

757
00:40:51,832 --> 00:40:53,197
I...

758
00:40:55,402 --> 00:40:57,029
I thought about it, and I was wrong.

759
00:40:58,105 --> 00:41:01,700
I made a commitment to you, and I'm
gonna see you through this pregnancy.

760
00:41:03,277 --> 00:41:05,336
It means a lot.

761
00:41:05,479 --> 00:41:08,915
So you are tolerating oral fluids
and your labs look good,

762
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:11,711
so I'll go ahead and get
your discharge papers ready. Okay?

763
00:41:22,696 --> 00:41:24,323
Thank you.

764
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:28,565
Thank you.

765
00:41:30,137 --> 00:41:32,765
- I'm doing this for Morgan.
- I know.

766
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:35,239
You're gonna need to sign this here.

767
00:41:38,112 --> 00:41:42,549
Look, I'm sorry if I, you know...
I shouldn't have...

768
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:45,416
I don't know what's gotten into me.

769
00:41:45,553 --> 00:41:49,216
Putting you in this position,
believing that you had feelings for me.

770
00:41:49,356 --> 00:41:53,383
I don't know what's gotten into me.

771
00:41:58,232 --> 00:42:00,427
You weren't wrong.

772
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:06,296
It wasn't all in your head.

773
00:42:07,875 --> 00:42:09,365
But...

774
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:12,635
...I can't let this happen.
