in the capital--Harare--

I'm g-gonna ask you again.
What are you doing here?

40
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:07,166
I gave you time to mourn.

41
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:09,375
How magnanimous of you.

42
00:02:09,417 --> 00:02:11,750
Oh, come on, Naomi.
We were good together.

43
00:02:11,792 --> 00:02:13,750
I missed you.
Last time I saw you,

44
00:02:13,792 --> 00:02:17,041
you yelled at me
and you just rolled off.
Rolled? Really, Nai?

45
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,000
Th-that's not what I meant.

46
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:22,458
He's gone, and I'm back,
so let the wooing begin.

47
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:34,417
Hey, Sam.
Who's the new girl?

48
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:37,208
Oh, hey.
It's only been
a few days, Coop, but...

49
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,041
It seemed longer?

50
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:42,750
Yeah. I-I hit a wall
with the captain and Archer.

51
00:02:42,792 --> 00:02:45,834
Oh, well, that makes sense.
Ooh, I can see that.

52
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:48,500
I-I know it wasn't easy
for you guys, either,

53
00:02:48,542 --> 00:02:50,417
but so you know, I, uh...

54
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,834
I appreciate it.

55
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:54,834
Hey, hey, hey.

56
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,625
Oh, I'm sorry.
Do you want--

57
00:02:56,667 --> 00:02:58,959
Ignore this.
Ever since bizzy died,

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,750
this has just been happening.

59
00:03:00,792 --> 00:03:03,041
So I'm fine. Ignore me.

60
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:05,625
Hey, you are never
gonna guess who...

61
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:07,542
Addison.
I'm fine.

62
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:10,542
I-I'm sorry. Are you okay?
No, it's, uh, transient tears.

63
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:13,625
Who--who showed up?
Spill.

64
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:15,834
Um... okay. Fife.

65
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,750
Hey. How's he doing?

66
00:03:17,792 --> 00:03:19,583
He's exactly the same.

67
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:22,333
Snarky,
aggressive, self-involved?

68
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:25,041
Pretty much.
Oh, he's not that bad.

69
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:29,208
Yeah, I didn't realize
how much I missed him.
Well, he certainly caught you
in the right mood.

70
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,750
Sorry. The bitchiness,
it comes with the tears.

71
00:03:31,792 --> 00:03:33,542
I can't control it.

72
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:36,125
Addison, if you--if you want
to talk about Archer, i--

73
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:38,125
no, I want to talk
about fife.

74
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:41,041
So did it stir up
some old feelings for you?

75
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:44,291
I don't know. It's, you know,
too early to tell.

76
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,041
I don't know.
You know, maybe.

77
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,375
Hey, lady.
Welcome back.

78
00:03:48,417 --> 00:03:51,041
Mm. Thank you.
I was just about
to call you.

79
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:54,041
I have a patient who came
to the hospital looking for you.

80
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:56,500
Fancy.
They wanted you, too.

81
00:03:56,542 --> 00:03:58,041
What's the issue?

82
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,041
Frank and isobelle's baby has

83
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:02,041
hypoplastic left heart syndrome.

84
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,250
Dr. Montgomery,
your in utero surgeries

85
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,375
have been well-publicized.

86
00:04:06,417 --> 00:04:09,041
Well, unfortunately, due to
the severity of this case,

87
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,041
your baby's heart
isn't strong enough

88
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,375
to pump blood through her body,
so no surgery--

89
00:04:13,417 --> 00:04:16,125
in utero or otherwise--
will help.

90
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:19,208
And we understand, she'll die
within a day of her birth.

91
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,875
We won't get to be parents
to her,

92
00:04:21,917 --> 00:04:25,667
but there is a way that we can
keep more than just her memory.

93
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:28,625
We've done I.V.F. Three times.
Miscarried twice.

94
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:31,250
She was our last embryo,

95
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:34,041
and I have
no more eggs left.

96
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:37,542
But our baby,
she has hundreds already.

97
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:41,208
But eggs don't mature
until adolescence.

98
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,834
Actually, we've done
quite a bit of research,

99
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:46,625
and, um, if an ovary
is treated with hormones,

100
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:49,083
it can speed up
the maturation process.

101
00:04:50,542 --> 00:04:53,125
I'm sorry. I'm not sure
what you're asking.

102
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:56,375
We're asking you
to remove our baby's ovary

103
00:04:56,417 --> 00:04:59,000
and fertilize her eggs
with donor sperm.

104
00:05:01,917 --> 00:05:04,959
I want another chance
at motherhood.

105
00:05:13,542 --> 00:05:15,500
- Hmm.
- Hot?

106
00:05:15,542 --> 00:05:18,500
Whew.
Do you think
they're too hot?

107
00:05:18,542 --> 00:05:21,041
Oh, how could you be
too hot?

108
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,709
My publisher said the jacket
photo is really important.

109
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,083
People see the author,
and it gives them a sense

110
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,083
of what they're gonna get
if they buy the book.

111
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:30,083
Well, I'd buy pretty much
anything from this woman.

112
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,083
I'm serious.
So am I.

113
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:34,542
Hey, tonight, um, maybe
you could wear this dress?

114
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,542
Oh, my god.

115
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:39,542
And I could pretend that I was
a fan at the book signing

116
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,917
and the bookstore was closing.
Hmm?

117
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:44,500
Okay... first of all,
that's not my dress.

118
00:05:44,542 --> 00:05:47,500
What?
Second of all, it would take
a stylist and an hour

119
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:50,291
to get my hair
to look that way again.

120
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,542
Oh. Mm.

121
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,959
These don't even
look like me.

122
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
They got you all worked up.

123
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:58,667
Mm-hmm.
You know what? I think you like
the fake, glammed-up me

124
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:01,041
better than the real thing.
Oh, come on, Violet.
Stop it.

125
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:03,041
You know what? These--
these are no good.

126
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:05,583
And you're no good.
Get out. Get out.
I'm--i-i--you got--

127
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:08,375
no, I cannot possibly get in
trouble for thinking that you--
you know what? Get out.
Get out.

128
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:11,625
If you like them so much...
Take them with you.

129
00:06:11,667 --> 00:06:14,041
Okay. Thank you.

130
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,333
Wait. What?

131
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:19,041
They want to use their baby
as an egg farm.

132
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,542
Severe hypoplastic left heart
syndrome is a death sentence.

133
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,792
Well, yes. We're all gonna die
eventually, but I doubt

134
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:25,792
that means that you're prepared
to donate an organ today.

135
00:06:25,834 --> 00:06:28,041
Stop. You're not seriously
discussing this?

136
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,625
Charlotte, you can't let that
happen at St. ambrose.
Why not?

137
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:34,041
Look, if it's publicity
you're after and--and you think

138
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,583
this is gonna translate
into funds,

139
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:38,083
then I can have the foundation
give the hospital money.

140
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:40,667
Would it achieve notoriety
for the hospital? Absolutely.

141
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:43,875
Would we be effectively
performing a miracle? Yes.

142
00:06:43,917 --> 00:06:45,792
And most importantly,
we could be altering

143
00:06:45,834 --> 00:06:47,458
assisted reproductive
technology forever.

144
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,041
That's why I want to do it.
But it is morally wrong.

145
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:53,583
Not everyone
shares your compass.

146
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:56,625
But you know that.
Addison, if there's something
personal that you want--

147
00:06:56,667 --> 00:07:00,000
okay, could we just stay
on topic for a second?

148
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,625
You are going
way off the rails here.
Cooper.

149
00:07:02,667 --> 00:07:05,041
In utero surgery can rupture
the mother's uterus, right?

150
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,250
It could.
Which she would need
if she wants to--

151
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:10,709
carry her baby's baby.
I was gonna say have another
baby, but, you know, yuck.

152
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,500
What if we wait
till the baby's born?
So that a baby that's gonna live
maybe a day

153
00:07:13,542 --> 00:07:16,750
can spend that day enduring
painful abdominal surgery?

154
00:07:16,792 --> 00:07:19,709
The cards are dealt.
I'm just suggesting

155
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,041
we create something good
out of a nasty situation.

156
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:25,083
We shouldn't do this.
Addison, you shouldn't do this.

157
00:07:26,792 --> 00:07:28,041
Hey, long night?

158
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,041
I was out
with my friend Michelle.

159
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,709
I finally convinced her

160
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,709
to take
the huntington's d.N.A. Test.

161
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,959
Is she seeing Violet
or Sheldon?
Neither.

162
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,041
I told her to come in,
we'd just do the test,

163
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,041
find out one way or another.

164
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,542
There's a 50% chance she'll find
out she's gonna die, Amelia.

165
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:45,750
She needs counseling
before that test.
She's strong.
She'll be fine.

166
00:07:45,792 --> 00:07:47,583
This is why doctor's
shouldn't treat their friends.

167
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,959
I'm doing this
because I'm her friend.

168
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,583
I'm thinking I want to
check out Naples.

169
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:57,458
It's time for another stamp
on my passport.

170
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,667
Ooh, Italian men.
Spicy. When you gonna go?

171
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:02,750
If I'm negative,
I'll go in the fall.

172
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:05,709
If I'm positive,
it's all over, right?

173
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,709
No, if you're positive,

174
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,583
you'll have 10 years, 20,
maybe more.

175
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,125
I know how it works--

176
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,125
early onset, late onset,
every complication.

177
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:17,125
There's all sorts of ifs,
but one thing is for sure.

178
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,750
From the day my mother was
diagnosed, it was a nightmare

179
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:22,291
that got worse and worse
until the day that she died.

180
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,709
And that was a relief.

181
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,208
And I...

182
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:30,583
I don't want to wait
for the horror show to start.

183
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,583
What does that mean?

184
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:36,000
If I'm positive,
I'm gonna kill myself.

185
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,583
All right.
I know that--

186
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,041
I think that--

187
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,583
oh...

188
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,250
You first.

189
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:58,959
Things are a little tense...

190
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
After, uh...

191
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:05,041
Our night on the deck.

192
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,417
It was--it was...

193
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:08,875
Just felt comfortable...

194
00:09:08,917 --> 00:09:10,041
Mm-hmm.

195
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:13,208
And, uh, familiar,
and we were just nostalgic.

196
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,041
And that's okay.

197
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,208
Don't patronize me, Naomi.
I--

198
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,208
okay?
I'm not chasing after you.

199
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:22,041
I just want to know
if you think it was

200
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,625
something more
than nostalgia.

201
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:28,375
Or are you still
thinking about Archer?

202
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:31,625
Uh, no, Sam. No.

203
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:34,625
So you mean to tell me
that you didn't feel anything

204
00:09:34,667 --> 00:09:39,041
when we were out there
all alone...

205
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:42,083
Aren't you two
supposed to be divorced?

206
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,667
Goo-goo eyes,
hushed tones...

207
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:46,208
It's good to see you,
Gabriel.
You don't mean that.

208
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,834
No, I don't.
Did she tell you about
the African lilies?

209
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:52,041
I thought they were impactful.

210
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,709
Speaking of which--

211
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,709
she's allergic. Okay.

212
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,667
Well, I've got patients.

213
00:09:57,709 --> 00:10:02,917
I'm sure you two have a lot
of... catching up to do.

214
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:06,333
Have dinner with me
tonight?

215
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,667
I-I can't.
Lunch?

216
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:10,750
No, i--there's no time.

217
00:10:10,792 --> 00:10:12,750
I will sit here and continue
to propose meals,

218
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:15,041
Espresso, crudités,

219
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,125
whatever it takes--
until you say yes.

220
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,625
I'm very patient.

221
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:22,792
I already told you. I like
that first set of pictures.

222
00:10:22,834 --> 00:10:26,709
Come on, Cooper.
Help me. Which one?
See, I know
how this turns out.

223
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,709
I say,
"the blue one looks nice,"

224
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,875
and you say,
"just nice not great?"

225
00:10:30,917 --> 00:10:32,875
And then I say, "no. You look
great in everything you wear."

226
00:10:32,917 --> 00:10:34,667
And then you say,

227
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:36,667
"you don't really sound like
you mean that." So I say,

228
00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:38,667
"no, it's not that. I just
like the other one better."

229
00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:40,667
And then we get to the part
where you say,

230
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:42,959
"you think I look fat in this,
don't you?"

231
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,709
And then I'm sleeping
on the couch.
You do realize
that I'm not Charlotte?

232
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,458
If you asked for help, I would
at least take it seriously.

233
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,166
This is important to me.
Please.

234
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,500
Okay. The blue one.

235
00:10:52,542 --> 00:10:54,500
Ooh, you think so?

236
00:10:54,542 --> 00:10:57,625
Hey, Sheldon.
Do you have a minute?

237
00:10:57,667 --> 00:11:00,458
Don't pick the blue one.

238
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:03,583
Uh...

239
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,917
I'm slammed.

240
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:08,000
We just need a minute.

241
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,709
- We?
- Please.

242
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:13,000
Dr. Montgomery, we are
desperate to be a family.

243
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,291
Giving birth, uh,
is not the only way.

244
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,625
Have you two
discussed adoption?

245
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:20,166
I need to be a mother
to a child

246
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:24,041
that came from inside of me,
a child that is a part of us.

247
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,041
It may be irrational,
but--

248
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,041
I understand that you want
to have a baby.

249
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,750
Frank and I have
been together 20 years.

250
00:11:30,792 --> 00:11:32,750
And at first, we were young.

251
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:35,208
You know,
we wanted to do things,

252
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,667
and then our careers--
you get off the fast track,

253
00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:39,041
you lose your place.

254
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,041
Finally, we were ready,
and after spending

255
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,041
every dime we had on I.V.F.,

256
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:46,542
two miscarriages
in the second trimester.

257
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:49,542
But when this baby
finally made it to 24 weeks,

258
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,208
we--we thought...

259
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,542
We--we thought
it would be okay.

260
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,667
But it's not,

261
00:11:55,709 --> 00:12:00,417
because our baby will be lucky
to get a full day of life.

262
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:03,583
So either god really hates us,

263
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,792
or she made it this far
for a reason.

264
00:12:05,834 --> 00:12:09,041
You know, women think
that they can have it all.

265
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:12,041
They can just wait and decide
when the time is right,

266
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:15,083
but we're wrong.

267
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:16,709
Okay.

268
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:20,667
You'll do it?
I can't guarantee
that it'll work.

269
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:22,458
It's never been done before.

270
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,625
And I won't risk your life
or risk perforating your uterus,

271
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:29,041
so I will do the surgery,
but after your baby's born,

272
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,750
not before.
Thank you.

273
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,000
You okay?

274
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:46,333
Michelle's test results.

275
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:49,125
I'm sorry.

276
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,125
I pushed her...

277
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,083
To find out, and now...

278
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:56,291
She's gonna kill herself,
Pete.

279
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,542
She's going to be devastated,
but--

280
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:01,083
no, she has already decided.
People say things. They--

281
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,959
Michelle knows
what is coming.

282
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,959
She saw what it did
to her mother.

283
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,083
I mean, she has seen
the clumsiness,

284
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:10,041
then it gets hard to swallow,
your muscles go rigid,

285
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:13,667
the seizures and dementia--
I mean, I don't blame her,

286
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,667
but I have
been through this before--

287
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:17,667
losing somebody close to me
way too soon.

288
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:20,500
And maybe it is selfish--
it's not selfish.
You care about her.

289
00:13:20,542 --> 00:13:23,750
But as good a friend as you are,
it's not enough anymore.

290
00:13:23,792 --> 00:13:27,375
You need
to get her some help. Now.

291
00:13:30,542 --> 00:13:33,250
No, I am serious.
Where'd you go?

292
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,250
I got a giant Grant
from the only place

293
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,166
that has more money
than you now.

294
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,917
The government.
Oh.

295
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,667
Mm-hmm.
Impressive.

296
00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:42,667
No, what's impressive is,

297
00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:44,917
I left my big, fancy office
at the n.I.H.

298
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,709
With lots of cute
little doctors fawning over me

299
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,041
to come back and get you.
To get me?

300
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,834
Come on, Naomi.
We have great chemistry.

301
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:56,291
You can't argue with science.

302
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:59,625
I'm... very fond of you.

303
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:01,542
But, uh...

304
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:03,583
This just isn't
the right time.

305
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:06,125
Please don't tell me
I'm competing with a dead man.

306
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,375
With William? No.

307
00:14:08,417 --> 00:14:11,000
No, I just...

308
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:15,625
Um... my life has
certain complications right now.

309
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:17,583
Oh.

310
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:21,583
Oh? What "oh"?

311
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:24,041
That's code for "Sam."
No.

312
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:25,458
No.

313
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,041
No.

314
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:29,542
Naomi, you can
talk to me, about anything,

315
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,750
even Sam.

316
00:14:31,792 --> 00:14:33,750
If you want to woo me,

317
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:37,583
discussing my ex-husband
i-is not the way to do it.

318
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,000
Okay?

319
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:50,625
You gonna do something?

320
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:52,834
I don't know.

321
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,375
Well, I want a banana.

322
00:14:54,417 --> 00:14:56,625
You know, it's customary

323
00:14:56,667 --> 00:15:00,166
for the boyfriend to offer
comfort in this situation.

324
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:04,000
Well, my comfort
isn't always... comforting.

325
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:07,166
Well, sometimes you just
have to plow through it.

326
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,125
Mm.

327
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:14,834
And sometimes
you just need to avoid.

328
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,333
Thank you.

329
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,083
Oh, keep it. Really.

330
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:50,417
Oh.

331
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,041
Okay.

332
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,041
You know, i'm--I'm okay,
you know.

333
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:57,083
I mean, it's not like
we were close or anything.

334
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,709
Well, sometimes
that makes it harder

335
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,041
than when
the relationship was good

336
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,500
and there were
no unresolved issues,

337
00:16:06,542 --> 00:16:08,375
nothing left unsaid.

338
00:16:08,417 --> 00:16:10,917
But it's not like anything's
even setting this off.

339
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,709
I am crying
because we're out of sweetener.

340
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,750
I mean, it's--it's like
my tear ducts

341
00:16:15,792 --> 00:16:16,750
are acting on their own.

342
00:16:16,792 --> 00:16:19,667
I just...

343
00:16:19,709 --> 00:16:21,875
I just want it to be over.

344
00:16:21,917 --> 00:16:25,583
Grief has its own timeline.

345
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:28,917
Wait, wait, wait.
What does that mean?

346
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,917
You can't get off
till the ride stops.

347
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,750
Even in college, you had
a killer poker face.

348
00:16:51,792 --> 00:16:53,000
Michelle--

349
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:55,000
you know, the day
my mother was diagnosed

350
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:57,166
was the worst day of my life,

351
00:16:57,208 --> 00:17:00,041
but today--
today could actually top it.

352
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,750
Okay.

353
00:17:05,417 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm ready.

354
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,041
You're negative.

355
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,583
What?

356
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:14,041
You don't have it.

357
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,458
You're not gonna get
huntington's disease.

358
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,750
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god!

359
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:23,250
Oh, my god.

360
00:17:30,709 --> 00:17:32,750
You lied to her
about the test results?

361
00:17:32,792 --> 00:17:34,250
Pete, I told you.

362
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,542
She said she would kill herself,
and she was serious.

363
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,792
And I told you that when you
have a suicidal patient,

364
00:17:38,834 --> 00:17:42,041
you refer them to a therapist.
You don't lie.
No, you do

365
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,875
when it is in the best interest
of your patient.
You're letting your friendship
get in the way

366
00:17:44,917 --> 00:17:47,166
of your medical training.

367
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:49,083
You're just
trying to justify this.

368
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,583
You were right.
You are being selfish.

369
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,583
One day--maybe sooner,
maybe later--

370
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:56,667
but one day she is gonna die
a shell of who she is.

371
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:58,667
But right now, Michelle is
healthy and happy,

372
00:17:58,709 --> 00:18:00,792
and she can stay that way
for ten years, even more.

373
00:18:00,834 --> 00:18:03,041
So as her doctor
and as her friend,

374
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:06,041
I need to protect her from pain
for as long as I can,

375
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:09,041
because neither of us
wants to give up yet,

376
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:11,250
not while she can still
go out dancing and travel

377
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,291
and tell jokes
that are so stupid

378
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:16,959
that they pull me out of
the blackest places I go.

379
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,709
As long as there is no treatment
for huntington's disease,

380
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,750
the best medicine
that I can offer her

381
00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:26,750
is to tell her that
she won't get it at all.

382
00:18:26,792 --> 00:18:29,750
What are you gonna tell Michelle
when she wakes up with symptoms?

383
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:32,542
I'm gonna ask...

384
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:35,875
Did you enjoy
the time you had?

385
00:18:35,917 --> 00:18:39,458
And hope to god she says yes.

386
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,208
Hey. Oh, cookies.

387
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,041
Oh, my god.
These are good.

388
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:57,667
They're crunchy,
but the chocolate's still soft.
I know.

389
00:18:57,709 --> 00:19:00,041
I'm keeping 'em over there
'cause I already had three.

390
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,542
Better be
from a grateful patient

391
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:05,041
and not some secret boyfriend.

392
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:08,792
"We're forever thankful for your
help. Frank and isobelle."

393
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,000
No.

394
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:15,041
Addison's gonna wait until
after the baby's born--

395
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:17,875
that's worse, Charlotte!
It's a baby!

396
00:19:17,917 --> 00:19:20,083
With a life--

397
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,625
a tragically short one,
but that is a life.

398
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:25,041
How are we not
on the same side here?

399
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,041
Because you're
ignoring the fact

400
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,625
that this could help make
another longer life.

401
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:32,166
I can't believe
you'd be a part of this.

402
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:39,166
So my publisher
needed these, like, yesterday.

403
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,166
Do any of these work?

404
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:42,834
Well, you look great.

405
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:45,041
Really?
Mm-hmm.

406
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,625
You kidding?
You look trustworthy, smart.

407
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:49,625
Yes, definitely.
Trustworthy and smart.

408
00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:52,792
Cooper?
Yeah, they're good.
What's with the book?

409
00:19:52,834 --> 00:19:54,625
It's a psych textbook.
I can see that,

410
00:19:54,667 --> 00:19:57,041
but how often do you sit
at the edge of your desk

411
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:59,458
with it
in your hand like that?
Well, the photographer
thought this staging

412
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,458
would make me look
more... respectable.

413
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,542
What, you don't like it?
No.

414
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,750
It's just, you look like
you're about

415
00:20:05,792 --> 00:20:08,041
two seconds away
from hurling it at a patient.

416
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:11,125
Well, you do look
a bit intense.

417
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,458
Which is not necessarily
a bad thing. Is it?

418
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,458
I'd buy a book
written by this woman,

419
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,542
in fact, I'd even pay
hardcover price.

420
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:21,458
But if you're asking...

421
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,458
This isn't you, Violet.

422
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,500
You're not some uptight, stodgy
therapist who looks like this.

423
00:20:26,542 --> 00:20:28,417
You're open and welcoming.

424
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,917
You sit on your couch
all curled up drinking tea,

425
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:32,917
making people
feel like they know you.

426
00:20:32,959 --> 00:20:35,041
I mean, that's who you are.
It's a good thing.

427
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,875
It's--it's why
your patients love you.

428
00:20:41,667 --> 00:20:44,041
Hey.
Hey.

429
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:46,041
Do you have a minute?
Oh, isobelle's water
just broke.

430
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,166
I was just on my way to
the hospital to check on her.

431
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:51,041
Addison, you're really
gonna do this?

432
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,792
You're gonna harvest
that baby's eggs?
That baby's gonna die.

433
00:20:53,834 --> 00:20:55,875
At least this way,
isobelle and frank--

434
00:20:55,917 --> 00:20:58,041
no, no,
just forget about them.

435
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,750
They are blinded by their
desire to become parents--

436
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:04,041
a desire which they clearly
do not understand.
Who does understand it?

437
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:07,041
It's some
psycho-biological impulse

438
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,667
that's hardwired into us.

439
00:21:08,709 --> 00:21:10,500
Well, it's also
a responsibility.

440
00:21:10,542 --> 00:21:12,500
That they seem
fully prepared to accept.

441
00:21:12,542 --> 00:21:15,750
I mean, Nai, where--
where is this coming from?

442
00:21:15,792 --> 00:21:19,125
You've devoted your whole life
to helping women

443
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,125
who can't conceive
on their own conceive.

444
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:23,417
No, this is different.
It's experimental.

445
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,041
No, this is Nazi Germany

446
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,500
and--and tuskegee
all rolled into one.

447
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:29,500
We are scientists
trying to progress.

448
00:21:29,542 --> 00:21:32,667
They want a baby. We might
be able to give them one.

449
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:35,750
By allowing them to treat
the baby that they have now

450
00:21:35,792 --> 00:21:37,750
like it's already dead?

451
00:21:37,792 --> 00:21:40,375
Addison, you can't do this.
I want to.

452
00:21:40,417 --> 00:21:42,917
But--o-okay. For whom?

453
00:21:42,959 --> 00:21:46,500
Addison...
You're grieving your mother,

454
00:21:46,542 --> 00:21:49,166
and you desperately
want a baby,

455
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,166
and if you can help them,
maybe it means

456
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:54,166
that down the road,
you might get one, too.

457
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:57,792
I know you're not questioning
my judgment.

458
00:21:57,834 --> 00:22:00,000
Maybe I am.

459
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:02,917
You've been questioning mine.

460
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:05,792
There are lines
that we shouldn't cross.

461
00:22:05,834 --> 00:22:08,750
Unless our teenage daughter
becomes pregnant.

462
00:22:08,792 --> 00:22:11,542
Oh, wow.

463
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:14,166
When did I stop knowing you?

464
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:25,041
Do you have a minute?
Do I have a choice?

465
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:28,250
Um...

466
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:32,834
I'm--I'm not
a romantic person.

467
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:35,208
Here it comes.
I'm a--
I'm a practical person.

468
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,208
I'm the person
who looks around

469
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:40,000
and sees what needs
to be accomplished,

470
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:41,208
and then gets it done.

471
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,041
When William was dying,
I-I fed him,

472
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:46,375
and I cleaned him,
and I did what I had to do.

473
00:22:46,417 --> 00:22:48,333
When my marriage to Sam
was over,

474
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:50,625
I was the one who took care
of all the details

475
00:22:50,667 --> 00:22:52,750
so that we could both
just move on.

476
00:22:52,792 --> 00:22:55,041
You carry
a lot of responsibility.

477
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,000
And Addison--
you know, I...

478
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:59,166
I have loved her
like a sister,

479
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:02,041
and I have forgiven her
all her flaws

480
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:03,583
because I-I know--

481
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:06,166
I know that she is doing
the best that she can.

482
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:09,208
Again, a heavy burden.
And it feels heavy. God.

483
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,750
Mm.

484
00:23:10,792 --> 00:23:12,750
Why is it then

485
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:15,041
that when--when I was--
when I was traveling the world

486
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:17,041
and--and doing all of
the foundation business

487
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:19,000
and solving serious problems,

488
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:20,291
i-i...

489
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:22,041
I felt so light?

490
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:24,041
Because the problems
you were solving

491
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:26,375
weren't your own.

492
00:23:26,417 --> 00:23:29,041
Yeah.

493
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:33,083
Fife says
he's in love with me.

494
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:35,083
Well, how do you feel
about that?

495
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:38,875
Well, you know, he makes me
laugh, and that feels good.

496
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:42,291
Recently,
Sam and I had a...

497
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:44,041
A moment,

498
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:47,041
and, uh, I don't know.

499
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:48,625
No. You know what? No.

500
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:50,625
I-I do not want
to revisit the past.

501
00:23:50,667 --> 00:23:53,542
I just--
so, uh, what do you want?

502
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:56,041
I don't know. I want simple.
I-I want to go

503
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:58,041
and build hospitals in India.

504
00:23:58,083 --> 00:24:01,041
I want to vaccinate
African children.

505
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:02,667
Is that all?

506
00:24:02,709 --> 00:24:05,041
So go build and vaccinate

507
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:07,834
and--and--and just...

508
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:10,000
Go.

509
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:16,667
Ow! Mm.

510
00:24:16,709 --> 00:24:18,041
It's okay, isobelle.

511
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:21,000
It hurts. Is it supposed
to hurt that much?
Unfortunately, yes.

512
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:23,083
Keep breathing.
Try to stay calm.

513
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:26,000
Oh, oh, oh.
The baby's cord
is prolapsed.

514
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:29,959
The baby's in distress.
We need to do a c-section.
Oh, help her!

515
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,959
Please help our baby.
Okay, okay.
You're okay. You're okay.

516
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,834
Oh! Ow!

517
00:24:36,834 --> 00:24:40,000
...every time.
I do n--

518
00:24:44,959 --> 00:24:46,041
what?

519
00:24:46,083 --> 00:24:48,250
As a recovering addict,

520
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:51,959
you know... honesty
is always the best choice.

521
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,542
This from a man
who tried to convince me

522
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:58,000
a patient could see when she
was actually still blind?

523
00:25:06,417 --> 00:25:10,625
So Pete told me about
your friend. I'm so sorry.

524
00:25:10,667 --> 00:25:13,375
Thank you.

525
00:25:13,417 --> 00:25:17,542
But you shouldn't
have lied to her.

526
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:21,917
She's living her life.
I'm helping her.
You're deceiving her,

527
00:25:21,959 --> 00:25:25,041
and--and she's living
someone else's life.
Of course you would
take his side.

528
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:27,041
No, i'm--I'm taking
your friend's side.

529
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:30,041
She's--she's gonna need people
that she can--that she can trust

530
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:32,834
down the line
when she becomes symptomatic.

531
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:34,834
I hope
she can still trust you.

532
00:25:34,875 --> 00:25:38,625
If I tell her the truth,
she will take her own life.

533
00:25:40,834 --> 00:25:42,792
Well...

534
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:45,041
Show her a reason to live

535
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:47,000
and bring her in here

536
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:50,417
where she can get the therapy
she really needs.

537
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:59,041
Can I help you?

538
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:02,667
Naomi can't move forward
while you're still holding on.

539
00:26:02,709 --> 00:26:05,083
Or she's just not
that into you.

540
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:09,166
You had her and you let her go.
That was your mistake.

541
00:26:09,208 --> 00:26:12,041
Now you need to do
the right thing for her.
You mean for you.

542
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:15,000
I mean for all of us.

543
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:17,041
You are an arrogant bastard.

544
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:20,458
Why don't you go back
to where you came from?

545
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,166
I intend to, with Naomi.

546
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:32,208
Is she okay?
I mean, I know that she's...

547
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:34,250
But is she okay?

548
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:37,041
She is resting.

549
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:39,041
Have you thought about
a name?

550
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:42,083
When can you do
the surgery?

551
00:26:42,125 --> 00:26:44,500
W-Wouldn't you like
to meet her first?

552
00:26:44,542 --> 00:26:47,041
Just remove her ovaries.

553
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:51,083
You said you would do it.
We need you to do it now.

554
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:04,917
Hey.

555
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:06,500
Hey.

556
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:08,000
You can't tell, you know?

557
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:11,250
She looks just like
all the other preemies.

558
00:27:11,291 --> 00:27:13,333
I wonder what she would've
grown up to be.

559
00:27:13,375 --> 00:27:15,041
Cooper, don't.
Don't go there.

560
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:18,041
How can you not?

561
00:27:19,792 --> 00:27:21,917
I have to take her now.

562
00:27:21,959 --> 00:27:24,917
Okay.

563
00:27:24,959 --> 00:27:26,917
Here we go.

564
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:29,000
Where are the parents?

565
00:27:29,041 --> 00:27:33,041
They don't want to meet her.

566
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:36,875
Oh, they're cowards.
They're worse.

567
00:27:36,917 --> 00:27:38,333
It's their right.

568
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:41,041
What about her rights?
What about her life?

569
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:43,583
She won't last the day.
So what?

570
00:27:43,625 --> 00:27:46,583
We're all gonna die.
We have no idea when.

571
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:48,041
And they just...

572
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:52,125
They say they want
to be parents,

573
00:27:52,166 --> 00:27:54,417
but parenting is more than
onesies and bassinets.

574
00:27:54,458 --> 00:27:55,917
It's a lifelong commitment,

575
00:27:55,959 --> 00:27:59,250
no matter how long or short
that life is.
Cooper.

576
00:28:00,917 --> 00:28:03,125
They don't deserve her.

577
00:28:09,458 --> 00:28:12,166
Okay. All right.

578
00:28:19,208 --> 00:28:20,875
Sheldon.
Hey.

579
00:28:20,917 --> 00:28:23,959
Just the man
I've been looking for.
Oh, sorry. I'm busy.

580
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,959
It'll just take a sec.

581
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,041
I said no, Charlotte.

582
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:29,875
I am sorry,

583
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,125
but I am tired of being
the sounding board

584
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:34,125
for all the women
around here.

585
00:28:34,166 --> 00:28:36,375
I can't solve everyone's
problems, nor do I want to.

586
00:28:36,417 --> 00:28:38,041
I have a life of my own.

587
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:40,041
Listen, I'm a man
and a therapist.

588
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:42,375
I like to believe that
that makes me sensitive.

589
00:28:42,417 --> 00:28:45,125
But do I care
what dress you wear?

590
00:28:45,166 --> 00:28:48,875
I mean, I've become the guy
who's not your boyfriend,

591
00:28:48,917 --> 00:28:50,875
who gets treated like
a boyfriend when it comes to

592
00:28:50,917 --> 00:28:54,000
the annoying things
that boyfriends don't want

593
00:28:54,041 --> 00:28:56,208
to deal with, but they have to
because if they don't,

594
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:58,208
they don't get any sex,
but still... I just--

595
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,291
please just keep
your problems to yourself,

596
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:04,041
or at least
just away from me.

597
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:07,500
I am resigning
as the not-boyfriend boyfriend.

598
00:29:07,542 --> 00:29:09,792
Well, I'm sorry
to hear that.

599
00:29:09,834 --> 00:29:13,041
Pass it on.
I will.

600
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:16,041
I-I guess I'll get
your check another time.

601
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:18,041
Fund-raiser for
the pediatric oncology unit.

602
00:29:18,083 --> 00:29:20,083
You pledged $1,000.

603
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:32,750
You need to step up.

604
00:29:32,792 --> 00:29:35,041
With your women.

605
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:36,417
Mine's not complaining.

606
00:29:36,458 --> 00:29:38,417
You both have amazing women
in your lives,

607
00:29:38,458 --> 00:29:41,709
you get all the perks,
but you need to be there

608
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,959
for the neuroses
and the insecurities

609
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,458
and the existential crises
that plague them.

610
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,041
I-I don't want to pick out
Violet's photo shoot wardrobe.

611
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:51,250
And--and Addison is grieving
and Naomi is--

612
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:53,792
Naomi's not one of ours.

613
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,083
What?

614
00:29:58,125 --> 00:30:00,291
I-I can't be
the not-boyfriend boyfriend.

615
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:02,000
Just--not anymore.

616
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:04,959
It sounds to me like you just
need to be a boyfriend.

617
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Look, I live with Violet's
neuroses every day

618
00:30:08,041 --> 00:30:09,792
and every night.

619
00:30:09,834 --> 00:30:11,792
And Sam gets
more than his share--

620
00:30:11,834 --> 00:30:13,333
Whew.

621
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:16,500
This is not about us.
What he's trying to say is,

622
00:30:16,542 --> 00:30:19,375
you need to find
a woman of your own.

623
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:22,375
But since, according to you,
I have two, I'm the expert,

624
00:30:22,417 --> 00:30:25,750
and I say, join a monastery.

625
00:30:28,375 --> 00:30:30,333
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

626
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:31,583
Okay.

627
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:37,959
Guess what I just did.

628
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,709
New sundress for Naples.

629
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:44,041
And--new hat.

630
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:46,333
Wanna come?

631
00:30:46,375 --> 00:30:50,375
Michelle...

632
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:54,959
I lied.

633
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,959
About the test.
You have the huntington's gene.

634
00:31:02,625 --> 00:31:04,041
But y-you said...

635
00:31:04,083 --> 00:31:06,041
I know. I'm sorry.

636
00:31:06,083 --> 00:31:08,417
You lied to me?

637
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:12,834
I was just afraid. You said
you'd kill yourself, and...

638
00:31:14,583 --> 00:31:17,583
Don't, because if you hug me
right now,

639
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,583
you're doing it
because you're sad for me,

640
00:31:19,625 --> 00:31:22,583
but you can't be sad for me
before I'm sad for me,

641
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:25,041
and I can't be sad for me,
because...

642
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:28,000
I'm too scared to be sad.

643
00:31:28,041 --> 00:31:30,542
I am so scared.

644
00:31:30,583 --> 00:31:32,041
Michelle--

645
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:34,917
I never
want to see you again.

646
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,041
What are you doing?

647
00:31:49,083 --> 00:31:50,792
This is your baby.

648
00:31:50,834 --> 00:31:55,041
Maybe not the one you hoped for,
but... she's still yours.

649
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:57,166
No, please. Please don't--
don't do this.

650
00:31:57,208 --> 00:32:00,583
You said you were desperate
to be parents. Are you?

651
00:32:00,625 --> 00:32:02,917
Don't you get it?
If--if we don't--

652
00:32:02,959 --> 00:32:05,166
we loved every baby
that didn't come to be.

653
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:08,041
We named the first two--
David and Rebecca.

654
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:09,834
But now... We...

655
00:32:09,875 --> 00:32:12,709
If--if we meet her,
we'll bond.

656
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:15,041
You want to be parents,
right?

657
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:17,041
Not for a day.

658
00:32:17,083 --> 00:32:18,917
You want to be parents?
Here's your chance.

659
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:21,458
If we do this,
we're gonna have to grieve.

660
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,917
You'll have to grieve anyway.

661
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:25,041
There's nothing you can do
about that.

662
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:28,625
At least this way
you'll know that...

663
00:32:28,667 --> 00:32:32,041
You did the one thing
you could.

664
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:37,959
Oh.

665
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,208

so unless you ever hit
those milestones,

762

Sam, you basically offered
to kill a man for Charlotte,

771
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:07,792
and--and Pete lied
about a patient's blindness,

772
00:38:07,834 --> 00:38:10,875
and, god, a pregnant junkie
came to St. ambrose,

773
00:38:10,917 --> 00:38:13,875
and instead of helping her,
we bought her baby.
