1
00:00:03,291 --> 00:00:05,083
♪ Ohhh ohhh ohhh ♪

2
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:17,041
Cooper, get out.

3
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:19,041
Oh, you look incredible.

4
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:21,333
You're not supposed
to see me yet.

5
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:23,041
I think...

6
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:26,000
I-I think it's a mistake
for us to do this.

7
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:42,667
Hey. You okay?
What's going on?

8
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:45,041
Are you
worried about something?

9
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:47,041
Are you getting
pre-wedding jitters?

10
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:49,875
You gonna jilt Cooper
at the altar?

11
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:51,875
Because I will drive
the getaway vehicle,

12
00:00:51,917 --> 00:00:53,917
no questions asked.
I am not jilting, Coop.

13
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:56,917
It's just, weddings mean family,
and our families...

14
00:00:56,959 --> 00:01:00,041
Look, my mama is
a straight-up southern belle,

15
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:02,041
which means
she's charming, judgmental,

16
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:04,041
and not afraid
to self-medicate.

17
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:07,041
Imagining her
with the freedmans...

18
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:09,000
And if they're anything like
their son,

19
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:11,000
they'll want to hug her
and kiss her

20
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:14,000
and whine about how there aren't
any good delis in Los Angeles.

21
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:16,083
You know, sometimes
when you have those

22
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:19,083
"worlds collide" situations,
they actually turn out okay.
And sometimes they end
with a giant fireball

23
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:20,917
that consumes
everything around 'em.

24
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:22,917
Well, how much time do they
have to spend together

25
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:24,291
before the wedding?

26
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:26,959
Cooper and I thought
we could limit it to a dinner.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,959
Is there anything
I can do to help?

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,542
Plan the dinner.

29
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:34,083
Oh. Okay. Uh, I was really
just asking to be polite,

30
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:37,041
but you really want me
to do it?

31
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:39,750
I just figured, if you're
gonna be my maid of honor...

32
00:01:39,792 --> 00:01:42,041
Wait. What? Really? Me?

33
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:45,083
We're junkies together. That
makes us b.F.F.S in my book.

34
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:47,917
And Cooper has Violet
as his best man.

35
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:50,875
He keeps saying I need someone
to stand up with me,

36
00:01:50,917 --> 00:01:53,875
so I would very much like you
to be my maid of honor.

37
00:01:53,917 --> 00:01:57,291
Just don't forget to bring
your fire extinguisher.

38
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:08,000
Can I help you?
I'm Dr. Violet Turner.

39
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:11,041
I was told you were the medical
investigator on my case.

40
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:13,542
Did we have an appointment
for today?

41
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:15,875
No. No, I just... I thought
we could take a few moments

42
00:02:15,917 --> 00:02:17,875
to talk about Katie Kent.

43
00:02:17,917 --> 00:02:20,875
Dr. Turner--
I mean, this whole thing has
been blown out of proportion,

44
00:02:20,917 --> 00:02:24,250
and I-I wanted to tell my side
of the story, and you'll see--

45
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,917
I-I think we can avoid
wasting everyone's time

46
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,917
on any kind
of formal investigation.

47
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,750
We have a protocol,
and I'm obligated to follow it.

48
00:02:31,792 --> 00:02:34,208
Please hear me out.

49
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:38,041
As long as you understand
that whatever you tell me

50
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:40,417
will in no way
limit the investigation

51
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:43,208
we've already opened
into your case

52
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,000
and can also be used

53
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:47,041
as the basis
for further inquiries.

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,125
Ready when you are.

55
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,875
Hey.

56
00:03:11,917 --> 00:03:14,458
I didn't know
you were back.

57
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,875
Uh, how was Africa?

58
00:03:16,917 --> 00:03:19,041
It was good.
It was really good.

59
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,125
Yeah? You look amazing.
Are you--

60
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,125
i'm--i'm--I'm late
for a meeting. Hi.

61
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,333
Hey. Welcome back,
na--
yeah.

62
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,667
Omi.
She hates me.

63
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:29,667
Well, she's not too crazy
about me, either.

64
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,041
So, uh...

65
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,583
Are we still agreed?

66
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,583
You don't have to
keep asking me that.

67
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,875
Well, I just don't want
things to be awkward

68
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:41,500
for Charlotte and Cooper.
It's not gonna be,
all right?

69
00:03:41,542 --> 00:03:43,500
We're not gonna tell anybody
we're broken up.

70
00:03:43,542 --> 00:03:45,500
We're gonna go
to the wedding together,

71
00:03:45,542 --> 00:03:48,709
and then afterwards, we're
gonna tell everybody that--
we're still friends. Okay.

72
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,458
You're gonna get a call
from the medical board

73
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,041
investigating Violet.

74
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:59,250
I can't believe
it's this serious.

75
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:02,041
Well, believe.
They're gonna interview you.
Me?

76
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,041
You and I are the only other
doctors who treated Katie,

77
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,792
and I just got my call, so...
You really think

78
00:04:06,834 --> 00:04:09,834
there's a chance
she could lose her license?
Yes.

79
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,208
But if we can help explain
what happened...

80
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,250
Just be very careful
when you answer their questions.

81
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:18,125
I know you're not asking me
to lie.

82
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,125
I'm asking you
to protect Violet.

83
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:22,125
I don't need
to be protected.

84
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:24,417
All the therapy
I did with Katie,

85
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:27,041
the--the attack, the trial,
the book--

86
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,041
I have nothing to hide,

87
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,083
and neither do you.

88
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,041
Miss me?

89
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,917
Gabriel,
what are you--

90
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,917
I heard your speech,
but I am confident

91
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:48,041
that eventually, you will
see the error of your ways,

92
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:50,792
and when you do,
I'll be here, waiting.

93
00:04:50,834 --> 00:04:52,166
Where are you going?

94
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,166
I have a patient
in assisted living.

95
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:57,083
I'm making a house call.

96
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,083
There are laws
against stalking.

97
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:02,041
Oh, prison doesn't scare me.

98
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,166
Marion?

99
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,917
Marion?

100
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:12,583
Hi. Did I forget
to tell you that I was coming?

101
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:15,375
Oh, I'm sure you didn't.

102
00:05:15,417 --> 00:05:17,333
Uh, this is Dr. Fife.

103
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:20,583
He's a colleague of mine.

104
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,625
Why don't we give Marion
a-a minute?

105
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:24,709
I've never seen her
in anything other than a dress

106
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,041
with her hair and nails done,
which means she's being polite.

107
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,792
Wouldn't have mattered.

108
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,041
Is this you?

109
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,041
Yes, and my husband Jerome.

110
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,917
How long were you married?

111
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:42,041
Jerome died just before
our 51st anniversary.

112
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:45,291
Well, bet you can still
fit in that dress.

113
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:48,625
Marion, your glucose
is really high.

114
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:51,041
Have you been taking
your Insulin?

115
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,583
Oh, careful.

116
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,208
Is there something wrong?

117
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,041
Oh.

118
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:59,041
You're not yourself today,
Marion. Did something happen?

119
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:02,041
If you want to talk,
Dr. Fife can leave and--

120
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,583
oh, it doesn't matter.

121
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,041
You know, Marion,

122
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:09,041
there is a therapist
here on staff.

123
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,166
And I have two in my office.

124
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,583
You want me to talk
to so-some stranger

125
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,041
half my age,

126
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,834
tell 'em I'm sad,

127
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,834
and then listen to him
try to put things

128
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,875
in a perspective
he doesn't have?

129
00:06:20,917 --> 00:06:23,041
I-I-It's just, that if
you're really sad, then--

130
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,875
we can zap the sadness out.

131
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:28,375
There's a procedure called
an anterior cingulotomy.

132
00:06:28,417 --> 00:06:30,709
The neurosurgeon uses
a gamma knife

133
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,083
to destroy the parts of
the brain that cause depression.

134
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:34,917
Gabriel.

135
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,917
Oh. Listen, thank you both
for coming here.

136
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:40,041
I'll try to remember
the Insulin.

137
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,041
But I don't need shrinks

138
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,709
and I don't need knives.

139
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,834
I just need to be left alone.

140
00:06:51,417 --> 00:06:53,041
Oh.

141
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,041
Hey, Cooper,
uh, this is, uh,

142
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,166
this is my lawyer,
Richard huvane.
Hello.

143
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,375
You went to speak with
Neal chaplin without me present?

144
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:02,417
What were you thinking?
I was thinking that if Katie
has dropped the lawsuit,

145
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:05,041
there's no reason for
the medical board to pursue it.
But they are pursuing it.

146
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,041
And now that they've opened
an investigation,

147
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,500
it doesn't matter
what she does.

148
00:07:09,542 --> 00:07:11,500
Well, I...
I-I-I didn't say anything.

149
00:07:11,542 --> 00:07:13,500
As soon as he brought out
the recorder, I left.

150
00:07:13,542 --> 00:07:15,834
I'm gonna catch up
to you later, okay?

151
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:18,917
Look, I-I was just thinking
that if I could...

152
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:21,834
I talked to Pete
about it--

153
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,083
Pete is now a witness
in this investigation.

154
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,875
Are--are you saying
I need to be cautious

155
00:07:26,917 --> 00:07:28,417
around my own husband?

156
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:31,208
You need to be cautious
around everyone.

157
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,542
It's your license
that's on the line.

158
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:45,041
The woman is probably just
depressed, and fife suggests

159
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:47,917
destroying part of her brain.
Well, if you invited him,
you should've known.

160
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:50,458
I did not invite him.
It's part of my strategy.

161
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,667
I did an anterior cingulotomy
back at Hopkins.

162
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:55,333
Pre-op, the man would not
even get out of bed.

163
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:58,041
Post-op, he was cooking dinner
for the entire neighborhood.

164
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,083
We gave him his life back.
So there.

165
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,041
But any surgery
on someone Marion's age

166
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,458
is gonna be rife
with potential complications,

167
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,458
including a stroke--
well, you have to be
brave enough to take that risk.

168
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,041
Actually, you're asking
the patient to take that risk,

169
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,041
which I'm not sure
makes you brave at all.

170
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,041
More importantly, Marion has
already made it clear

171
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:17,208
that she does not want
this surgery.
That's the depression talking.

172
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,834
It's clouding her judgment

173
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,834
and making her incapable
of an informed decision.

174
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,834
Depression doesn't necessarily
make someone incompetent.

175
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,333
Unless it does,

176
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,291
which makes this
kind of a catch-22.

177
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,125
I mean, we can't treat
her depression

178
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:30,542
if her depression is preventing
her from seeking treatment.

179
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:33,709
Marion shouldn't be
included in this.
What?

180
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:37,041
The disease determines
the cure, not the patient.
Listening to your patient,
working with them,

181
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,208
that's essential
to good doctoring.

182
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,667
Healing is essential
to good doctoring.

183
00:08:41,709 --> 00:08:44,250
Amelia uses the gamma knife,
Marion will feel better.

184
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,959
It's a win-win.
No one is doing
any kind of cutting

185
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,959
until we determine
just how bad off Marion is.

186
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,625
Will you please
talk to her?

187
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:53,250
Sure.

188
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,333
Thank you.

189
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,959
What a lovely place
to work.

190
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,041
And, uh, saving the best
for last--

191
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,417
this is the office
of Dr. Charlotte king.

192
00:09:05,667 --> 00:09:08,250
Violet,
you are funny as ever.

193
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,333
Oh.
Whoo-hoo.

194
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:13,333
Mom, what are you doing here?

195
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,458
Ooh.
Hi.

196
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,875
You told us to wait,
but you know your mother.

197
00:09:18,917 --> 00:09:21,208
We were too excited,
so we came on over.

198
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,208
And then we saw Violet
in the elevator...

199
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:27,041
- Who has this amazing figure, even after having a baby.
- Yeah, yeah.

200
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:32,041
Yeah, I was just coming
to find you.
Uh, mom, dad,

201
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,375
um, this is Charlotte,
and this is her mother,

202
00:09:34,417 --> 00:09:36,583
Augusta king.

203
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,792
It's a pleasure.
Hello.

204
00:09:38,834 --> 00:09:40,875
Hello.
Nice to meet you.

205
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:53,333
Well, isn't this great,
everybody finally meeting?

206
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:58,083
Hey, maybe I'll just show mama
around the rest of the office.

207
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:01,041
Oh, great idea. Um, why don't
you guys come with us? Go with--

208
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,333
actually, you know, your mother
and I are kind of hungry.

209
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,458
Oh, well, it's--
it's lunch time right about now.

210
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,083
Why don't you all go
to the promenade

211
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,625
and have lunch first?
That's a great idea.
And you'll be joining us, right?

212
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:14,041
Oh, well, i'm--I'm really
kind of busy.
Of course she's coming
with us.

213
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,667
Charlotte, I'd love to see
your office. Now.

214
00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:18,959
Oh, but let's, uh...
Uh, lunch?

215
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,041
Another time.

216
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,959
Enjoy.

217
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,041
Well, I'm thinking deli,
but, uh,

218
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:29,041
I could be persuaded to try
something a little more risque.

219
00:10:30,834 --> 00:10:32,792
Hey.

220
00:10:32,834 --> 00:10:34,792
I keep running into fife
in the halls.

221
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:37,291
Is he, uh, working here
again or--

222
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:40,875
no, he just--he says he won't go
away until I agree to date him.

223
00:10:40,917 --> 00:10:42,250
Wow.

224
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:46,250
I give him a 10
for perseverance.

225
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,917
So what do you rate him
for style?

226
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,500
You know what?

227
00:10:50,542 --> 00:10:53,458
I have a bunch of research
I have to do, so...

228
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,291
Oh. Okay.

229
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,750
Okay.

230
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:03,917
Hey, Sam and I broke up.
I, uh...

231
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:06,041
I just thought
you should know.

232
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,709
Why?

233
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,500
Well, he wouldn't commit
to having a child with me

234
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:16,500
and I didn't want to wait--

235
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:18,583
no, I meant why--why are you
telling me this?

236
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,166
I mean, y--

237
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,709
you and I,
we're not exactly...

238
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,625
Look, Nai, there's been
this wall up between you and me

239
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:27,625
since Sam and I got together,

240
00:11:27,667 --> 00:11:29,667
and I don't
want it there anymore.

241
00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:31,709
I want my best friend back.

242
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:40,875
That's it?
You're not gonna say anything?

243
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,625
I hope it was worth it.

244
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:50,583
I told you, you should've
ordered the brisket.

245
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:54,041
I'm sorry. It's just,
um, just kind of a bad day.

246
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:57,333
But you know what?
I-I think I should go.

247
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,000
What, so soon?

248
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,333
Dad, enough. Let her go.

249
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:04,375
Well, the three of you
need time to catch up,

250
00:12:04,417 --> 00:12:08,667
and, um, yeah, I'll see you
back at the office.
Fine.

251
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,250
Is everything okay
with Violet?

252
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,875
I swear, she didn't smile once
the whole meal.

253
00:12:14,917 --> 00:12:17,041
She is... going through
a rough patch right now.

254
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,875
She'll be okay.

255
00:12:18,917 --> 00:12:20,917
Well, I hope so.
She is such a good girl.

256
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,917
Is there anything
that we can do to help?

257
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,166
Yeah, how about worrying
a little less about Violet

258
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:28,166
and asking me
about my future wife?
Well, we introduced ourselves,

259
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:31,667
and then she and her mother
were gone.
Are you really surprised?

260
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:34,041
I mean, you completely shut down
when I introduced you.

261
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,917
Well, the mother
was pleasant enough.

262
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,041
But I did find Charlotte
to be a bit... cold.

263
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,750
Charlotte is not cold. It takes
a while to get to know her.

264
00:12:43,792 --> 00:12:45,333
We know enough.

265
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:48,875
Oh, yeah? What's that
supposed to mean?

266
00:12:48,917 --> 00:12:51,250
Cooper,
for the last few years,

267
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,250
your father and I
have listened to you--

268
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:56,041
every phone call,
every e-mail.

269
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:59,250
And do you know how many
of those were you being upset

270
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,875
about something Charlotte did?
Come on. Wait a minute.
That is not fair.

271
00:13:01,917 --> 00:13:04,875
No, she's right, Coop. We went
through all of that with you--

272
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:07,959
the lying to the ex-husband,
sleeping with that Arthur--

273
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,041
- Archer.
- Oh, it doesn't matter.

274
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,041
The point is, she's hurt you,
more than once.

275
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:15,041
And we--we understand that
you're going to marry her, but--

276
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:17,041
but you can understand
why we can't exactly

277
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:20,166
open our arms to her and pretend
that nothing happened.

278
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,000
You're--you're my parents.

279
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,000
I was giving you one side
of the story.

280
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,041
There's lots of good stuff
about Charlotte

281
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:29,041
that I didn't tell you.
Well, I'm sure that's true,
but we love you, Cooper,

282
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,041
more than anything.

283
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:34,542
So anyone who hurts you...

284
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,375
Mm.

285
00:13:39,542 --> 00:13:41,500
The chuppah
will be over here.

286
00:13:41,542 --> 00:13:43,542
Uh, that's just
a little gazebo.

287
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:46,083
I know what a chuppah is,
darling.

288
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,500
It's the one concession
Cooper asked for.

289
00:13:48,542 --> 00:13:50,291
It's important
for his parents.

290
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,041
Oh, his parents.

291
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,041
You know, Charlotte,

292
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,208
the freedmans
aren't those huggy, kissy,

293
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,792
in-your-face kind of people
you warned me about.

294
00:14:00,834 --> 00:14:02,709
In fact,
they're a little cold.

295
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,291
You're right.
They were cold.

296
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,917
And the way they fawned
over that other doctor--

297
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:10,083
what's her name?
Violet.

298
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:13,208
You would think she was
the one marrying Cooper.

299
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,208
Cooper and Violet
are best friends.

300
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,250
His parents have known her
for a long time.

301
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,875
Best friends?

302
00:14:18,917 --> 00:14:20,875
I suggest you do as I do

303
00:14:20,917 --> 00:14:23,875
and try not to let that
get under your skin.

304
00:14:23,917 --> 00:14:25,250
You listen, baby girl,

305
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:28,208
as your mother, I have to
tell you how it is,

306
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,208
and his parents
do not like you.

307
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:33,875
They barely know me.
Honey, they're not looking
to know you.

308
00:14:33,917 --> 00:14:35,041
Mama.

309
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,041
No, look...

310
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,875
I bet they're out there
right now with Cooper

311
00:14:39,917 --> 00:14:43,875
telling him that you are not
his kind of girl.
I highly doubt that.

312
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:46,041
I'm not saying
Cooper's gonna listen.

313
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:50,083
I'm just saying, you marry
a boy, you marry his family.

314
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:53,041
Just consider it a warning.
I can't
talk about this anymore.

315
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,041
I have to get
to my final dress fitting.

316
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:58,041
Oh, I can't wait
to see it on you.

317
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:00,250
I'm not doing anything.

318
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,792
Look, mama, you can come
to the fitting,

319
00:15:02,834 --> 00:15:05,583
but the dress... it's not
gonna make you happy.

320
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:08,041
Did something happen to it
in the mail?

321
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,041
No, it arrived just fine,

322
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:14,041
but... I'm not wearing
the family dress.

323
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,417
Charlotte...

324
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:18,291
For a hundred years,
the women in our family

325
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:21,417
have worn that dress
when they took their vows.

326
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,041
Is this because of Cooper?

327
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,458
Has he talked you out
of wearing that dress?

328
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,458
Cooper doesn't know anything
about the dress.

329
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,125
Now listen to me, mama.

330
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,125
I wore the dress
when I married Billy,

331
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,458
and look where that got me.

332
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,875
That can't possibly be
the dress' fault.

333
00:15:36,917 --> 00:15:39,250
Now I know you don't want
to do this,

334
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,458
but it's what big daddy
would've wanted.

335
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,250
And I know you don't want
to let him down.

336
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,500
Dr. Bennett
should leave well enough alone.

337
00:15:51,542 --> 00:15:53,959
Well, Dr. Bennett doesn't feel
you are well enough.

338
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,959
That's why she asked me
to talk to you.

339
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,458
She's concerned
that you might be depressed.

340
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,041
She said she offered you
several treatment options,

341
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:04,083
but you didn't seem
to have any interest.
Well, that's my right,
isn't it?

342
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,709
Yes, but our goal
is to make you feel better.

343
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,709
And it's possible
that your illness

344
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,166
is standing in the way

345
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:13,166
of your ability to discern
what's best for you.

346
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:16,750
Dr. Wallace,
one day you'll be old.

347
00:16:16,792 --> 00:16:20,166
You'll be old and then
eventually you'll be sick.

348
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:23,875
And then you'll be sad...
And lonely.

349
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:26,875
And sometimes, you won't want
to get out of bed

350
00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:29,041
or be with people.

351
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:32,291
When that happens, I hope nobody
treats you like a child,

352
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:35,834
because it only makes you
feel worse.

353
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,041
You know,
if you want to avoid me,

354
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,041
you should know better
than to come in here

355
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:48,041
when I'm having
my pre-dinner breakfast.

356
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:51,041
Oh. I'm not trying
to avoid you.

357
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,583
I'm not.

358
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,583
I just, uh...

359
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:58,125
It's just, the reentry
gets harder every time.

360
00:17:00,542 --> 00:17:03,458
You know, I miss Maya and Olivia
so much when I'm gone.

361
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,125
But when I'm traveling
for the foundation,

362
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:08,959
I just--i-i have a purpose.

363
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,333
You know, the work we do,
it's changing lives,

364
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:14,041
and I see it.
I see it every day.

365
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:17,542
Then I come back here
to all the... petty drama.

366
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:20,458
We're pretty
well-stocked in that.

367
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,041
Yeah. I'm sorry.

368
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,542
I-I didn't mean to downplay
what happened

369
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:28,250
with you and Addison.

370
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:33,041
She told you.

371
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,750
Unbelievable.

372
00:17:34,792 --> 00:17:37,208
What, was I not supposed
to know?

373
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,250
Well, we, uh, we had agreed
not to tell anybody

374
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:41,875
until after the wedding,

375
00:17:41,917 --> 00:17:43,875
but still,
she goes running to you.

376
00:17:43,917 --> 00:17:47,208
You know, that's just...
That's who she is.

377
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,166
It's who she's always been.

378
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:52,083
Well, how do you--
how do you get past that?

379
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,959
I don't think you can.

380
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:04,875
So you treated Ms. Kent
for pain?

381
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,000
Not just pain. She had nausea
associated with her pregnancy.

382
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:08,375
Did you
prescribe her anything?

383
00:18:08,417 --> 00:18:10,041
I took a holistic approach--

384
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,542
acupuncture, acupressure.

385
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:15,500
Were you at all concerned
about how she was responding?

386
00:18:15,542 --> 00:18:17,500
Specifically,
do you feel like Ms. Kent

387
00:18:17,542 --> 00:18:19,291
was getting better or worse?

388
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:22,834
After she miscarried, I needed
to perform an emergency d&amp;C.

389
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,291
Did you
perform it immediately?

390
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,291
No, not immediately.

391
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,417
Why not?

392
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,875
Answer the question, please.

393
00:18:30,917 --> 00:18:33,250
Violet, uh...

394
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:35,458
Dr. Turner
felt it was important

395
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,041
that Katie fully comprehend
the loss of her baby

396
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,083
before the procedure.

397
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:43,917
And what happened
as a result of the delay?

398
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:47,291
Katie went into septic shock.

399
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:50,250
But she came through
just fine.

400
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:53,709
And you believe it was medically
appropriate to have waited?

401
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,125
Yes, Katie was--

402
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:57,083
I... um,
Violet calmed her down,

403
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,667
and then I did the d&amp;C.

404
00:18:59,709 --> 00:19:02,083
And how did Dr. Turner
calm her down?

405
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,083
She related the experiences
of her own pregnancy.

406
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:06,709
It was a way of bonding,
and it worked.

407
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,041
And how exactly do you know
what was said

408
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,041
during Katie's therapy session
with Dr. Turner?

409
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,583
Uh, I don't know specifics,

410
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,875
but our practice
is cooperative.

411
00:19:15,917 --> 00:19:19,041
Doctors often discuss
their cases with each other.

412
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:20,917
Including matters not relevant

413
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,917
to their specific areas
of responsibility

414
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:24,417
to those patients?

415
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,417
Is that really the ethic
of your practice?

416
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,417
Well, now you're making us
sound like gossips.

417
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,750
Then let me clarify
my question.

418
00:19:30,792 --> 00:19:33,041
Does Dr. Turner ever share
the personal details

419
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,709
of her patients with you,

420
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,041
even when
you're not treating them?

421
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:40,208
Only when it's therapeutically
beneficial to the patient.

422
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,208
Can you please list the names
of all other patients

423
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,834
with whom Dr. Turner shared
such personal information?

424
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,959
So you got nowhere?

425
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,542
On the contrary.

426
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:59,041
An hour in the lobby
was very informative.

427
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,250
It's like a college dorm
for septuagenarians.

428
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,041
Everyone into everyone
else's business.

429
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,625
Not unlike this practice.

430
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:08,041
I asked around. Marion
had a good friend named Walter.

431
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,333
He died of a heart attack
a few weeks ago.
Well, so maybe that's it.

432
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,041
That's why she's been giving up
and not taking care of herself.

433
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:17,041
She's just grieving.
Mm-hmm. She is.
But when you get to her age,

434
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,041
loss is
a much more common occurrence.

435
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:22,041
And I think the best way
to deal with it is therapy.

436
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,875
Mm. Most elderly patients
are resistant

437
00:20:24,917 --> 00:20:27,667
to the standard treatment
of meds and talk therapy.

438
00:20:27,709 --> 00:20:30,458
And frankly, at Marion's age,
she doesn't have the luxury

439
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,458
of spending five years
on your couch,

440
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,041
especially when all her pain
can be eradicated

441
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,458
with one procedure.

442
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,458
Well, congratulations
on your psychiatric degree.

443
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,458
Where--where'd you get that?
Oh, snark away.

444
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,834
Pretty soon, you'll be able
to get one out of a cereal box.

445
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,458
With the advent
of psychosurgeries

446
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,458
and new
psycopharmaceuticals,

447
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,917
your degree
is becoming obsolete.
Why are you here?

448
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:51,500
You don't even work
for the practice anymore.
Oh, I'm here for her.

449
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:54,583
Okay, th-this
is not productive.
No, it isn't,
but you're being myopic.

450
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:57,041
The best thing for Marion
is the gamma knife surgery.

451
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,875

you weren't sharing the intimate

The same day we decided
to keep our split a secret,

500
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:14,792
you went and told her.

501
00:23:14,834 --> 00:23:18,083
She had
a right to know, Sam.
No, this didn't involve her.

502
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:20,792
Well, she's your ex-wife
and my best friend,

503
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:22,500
so it did involve her.

504
00:23:22,542 --> 00:23:24,500
Please. You just wanted
to be let off the hook.

505
00:23:24,542 --> 00:23:27,041
What did you think,
that if you told her first,

506
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:30,041
she'd forgive you
for everything that happened?
That's not fair, Sam.

507
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:32,291
No, but it's true.

508
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:34,458
Maya, Naomi, and I
adjusted our lives to

the toll that took.

511
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:42,834
It took
a toll on me, too, Sam.

512
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:45,041
I mean, I sacrificed
my best friend

513
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:48,041
for a man I was sure I was
gonna raise a family with.

514
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:50,667
You think I'm being selfish?
Take a look at yourself.

515
00:23:50,709 --> 00:23:53,208
You've wanted me
since med school, okay?

516
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,875
So don't flatter yourself

517
00:23:54,917 --> 00:23:57,875
that any pain that this
has caused is all my fault.

518
00:23:57,917 --> 00:24:00,750

I don't think he meant to,

but apparently,
he tells them everything,

542
00:24:57,792 --> 00:24:59,750
including every mistake
I've ever made.

543
00:24:59,792 --> 00:25:01,583

You're not taking
our files.

557
00:25:34,709 --> 00:25:37,250
We're not taking them.
We're only copying them.
What's going on?

558
00:25:37,291 --> 00:25:40,041
They're trying to take
our patient files.
They're relevant
to our investigation.

559
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:43,041
We have consent
from the patients involved

560
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,041
to review them, so--
I'll call our lawyers.

561

It's not gonna matter.
I can deal with this.

Unfortunately, this

563
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:53,041
We cannot let them
walk all over Violet.

564
00:25:53,083 --> 00:25:55,041
Well, they're already
standing on her neck,

565
00:25:55,083 --> 00:25:57,125
and they seem hell-bent
on making the rest of us

566
00:25:57,166 --> 00:26:00,250

That's why we need
to mitigate the damages.

567
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:02,583
Mitigate?
Well, maybe if Violet
were to take

568
00:26:02,625 --> 00:26:05,041
a voluntary leave of absence
until the investigation

569
00:26:05,083 --> 00:26:07,917
is complete...
That's your idea
of doing something?

570
00:26:07,959 --> 00:26:10,041
Well, he's right.
Sorry I'm late.

571
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:11,792
Where's Violet?

572
00:26:11,834 --> 00:26:14,083
We asked her not to come.
Is that fair?

573
00:26:14,125 --> 00:26:18,375
Right now fair is not
our biggest problem.
Maybe if we show them
that we are cooperating--

574
00:26:18,417 --> 00:26:21,041
no, it's not fair,
and we are cooperating.
If Violet steps back,
it makes it

575
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:23,875
look like she knows
that she did something wrong.

576
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:27,041
Or it makes it look like
she's taking it seriously.
Our primary concern right now
has to be

577
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:30,041
protecting the practice. I mean,
they're copying our files,

578
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:32,125
they're dragging us down
for interviews.

579
00:26:32,166 --> 00:26:34,750
This investigation
is only gonna get bigger.
Let them see
whatever they want to see.

580
00:26:34,792 --> 00:26:37,834
We're not an organized
crime family. We're doctors.

581
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:42,041
No offense, but how long have
you been here, like a week?
She's not supposed
to take offense to that?

582
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:44,875
Look--
listen, we all
talk about our patients,

583
00:26:44,917 --> 00:26:47,458
not just Violet.
Exactly,
which is why we don't want

584
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,750
the medical board investigating
anyone else,

585
00:26:49,792 --> 00:26:52,125
so we--
this doesn't feel right.
One of our own

586
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:55,125

We need to stand by her.
Isn't that what this place
is supposed to be about?

587
00:26:55,166 --> 00:26:58,041
The only people Violet tries
to help more than her patients

588
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:00,041
are all of us,
and if we can't...

589
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:03,125
If this is all it takes for us
to turn our back on her,

590
00:27:03,166 --> 00:27:06,291

We have a child.

The fact that you're married
helps, but I have to be honest,

599
00:27:31,834 --> 00:27:33,959
the situation looks bad.

600
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,959

to be a serious matter at o.W.G.

601

gonna apologize

602

we practice medicine.

603
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:43,917
We know how to help people,
we're good at it.
I'm sure you are,

604

Well, it's not gonna change.

that we are suddenly gonna act

I don't care who sues me
or what's at stake.

612
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:07,625
We can't do that.

613
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,542
Oh. I prefer
you not be here.

614
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:18,375
There's something
I'd like to know first.

615
00:28:18,417 --> 00:28:20,667
I'm, uh...

616
00:28:20,709 --> 00:28:22,458
Having trouble understanding

617
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,458
why you wouldn't want
to improve

618
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,125
your quality of life.

619
00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:28,041
The other doctors
at the practice

620
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:30,041
seem to think your depression
stems from grief

621
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,875
over the loss
of your friend Walter.

622
00:28:32,917 --> 00:28:35,208
Oh, and you know better?

623
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,333
I have that way about me,
do I?

624
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:39,333
Jerome had
the same brash confidence.

625
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:41,041
Wh-when you lost him--

626
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:44,041
I can't imagine spending
half a century with someone

627
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:47,041
and then having to go on,
but you did, for years.

628
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:49,041
And according to Dr. Bennett,
you thrived,

629
00:28:49,083 --> 00:28:52,041
which leads me to believe that
if you can get over Jerome,

630
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:55,166
you can get over Walter, too.

631
00:28:55,208 --> 00:28:57,792
I noticed the words
on the game haven't changed

632
00:28:57,834 --> 00:29:00,583

I was here.

633

Walter.

635
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,792
He was my friend.

636
00:29:08,834 --> 00:29:10,834
Oh, we talked...

637
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:13,583
About our spouses,
about our lives.

638
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:16,834
We both loved to play scrabble,
almost every day.

639
00:29:16,875 --> 00:29:18,458
That sounds nice.

640
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,959
Oh, it was more than nice.
It was wonderful.

641
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,333

without Jerome,

642
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:26,667

I connected with...

643
00:29:26,709 --> 00:29:28,500
That's okay, Marion.

644
00:29:28,542 --> 00:29:30,834
But I-I couldn't.

645
00:29:30,875 --> 00:29:33,750
I couldn't do that to Jerome.
I just couldn't.

646
00:29:33,792 --> 00:29:35,333
You couldn't do what?

647
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,959
We were in the middle
of the game, that game,

648
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,041
and he turned to me
and smiled and he...

649
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:46,625
He told me he loved me.

650
00:29:46,667 --> 00:29:49,291
Well, what did you do?

651
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:51,458
I was so embarrassed.

652
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:56,000
I... I told him
to get out.

653
00:29:56,041 --> 00:29:58,041
A week later, he...

654
00:29:58,083 --> 00:30:00,166
He was dead.

655
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:02,041
But you did love him.

656
00:30:03,417 --> 00:30:06,041
Oh, how could I tell him?

657
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:10,041
It was like
I was cheating on Jerome.

658
00:30:10,083 --> 00:30:13,875
And now
Walter will never know.

659
00:30:13,917 --> 00:30:16,000
He'll never know
I loved him.

660
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:23,375
He sat across that board
from you for a lot of hours.

661
00:30:23,417 --> 00:30:25,917
Right?

662
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:27,709
So he knows.

663
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,083
Whether you said it
or not,

664
00:30:30,125 --> 00:30:33,375
I'm sure he knows.

665
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:49,417
We are going to be so late
to Cooper's dinner.

666
00:30:49,458 --> 00:30:52,917
Um... why aren't you dressed?

667
00:30:52,959 --> 00:30:56,041
Maybe Sam and Naomi
are right.

668
00:30:56,083 --> 00:30:58,625
Maybe I am putting
the practice at risk.

669
00:30:58,667 --> 00:31:01,625
No, they're not right.
Well, I could--
I could step away.

670
00:31:01,667 --> 00:31:04,542
I mean, if that's what people
want, which I don't know,

671
00:31:04,583 --> 00:31:06,542
'cause I wasn't invited
to the meeting,

672
00:31:06,583 --> 00:31:09,417
but if that's what it takes--
no, look,
your book was all about

673
00:31:09,458 --> 00:31:11,834
exposing yourself
to help other people.

674
00:31:11,875 --> 00:31:14,625
You've stood up to everything
that's been thrown at you,

675
00:31:14,667 --> 00:31:16,625
and you've come out

00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,583
And I just--i had no idea.

848
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:18,583
So just so you know, I-I spoke
to the medical board today

849
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:21,500
and, uh, answered
all their questions.

850
00:40:21,542 --> 00:40:24,041
Um, but I didn't apologize
for what I wrote,

851
00:40:24,083 --> 00:40:26,250
because what I wrote reflects

852
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:29,291
who we are and the kind
of practice that we have.

853
00:40:29,333 --> 00:40:32,291
We are friends and colleagues
who rely on each other

854
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:35,291
to help our patients,
and I am proud of us.

855
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:38,333
So they said they'd, uh,
get back to me with a decision,

856
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:42,083
but they didn't say when,
so... there you have it.

857
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:44,125
Okay.

858
00:40:44,166 --> 00:40:47,458
Well, we're all here.
We might as well celebrate.

859
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,041
I, uh, I ordered champagne
for everybody.
