65
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,000
It's a letter
from the medical board.

66
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,709
They're suspending
my license.

67
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,500
You're kidding me.

68
00:03:53,542 --> 00:03:55,917
Uh, it gets worse.

69
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:59,041
Now they're coming after
the practice.

70
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:02,041
I can't believe
we're being investigated.
I'm sorry. I never meant
for any of this to happen.

71
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:06,000
You didn't
do anything wrong.
The point is, the medical board
thinks she did something wrong,

72
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,875
which means they might think
we all have.
Let's not overreact--

73
00:04:08,917 --> 00:04:10,875
oh, come on, Pete.
We're under investigation.

74
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,041
Once they start
digging around--
face it. We're all screwed.

75
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,834
I mean, what, we share
confidential information.

76
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:19,041
We lie to our patients
for their own good.

77
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:22,041
We pushed the line so far back,
it isn't even a line anymore.

78
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,041
We're not doctors. We're
friggin' cowboys with guns.

79
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,041
No. We refuse to follow rules
made up by people

80
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,834
that don't take the cases
that we do--the hard cases.

81
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:31,834
We refuse to let them determine
the course of people's lives.

82
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:34,041
And if we cross a line
every now and then, big deal.

83
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,500
It's for the benefit
of the patient.
This isn't helping.

84
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:38,750
The--the original idea
of oceanside wellness was

85
00:04:38,792 --> 00:04:40,959
doctors working cooperatively
to do everything they can

86
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,500
to help their patients--sharing
ideas and debating cases.

87
00:04:44,542 --> 00:04:48,041
It's not wrong. This works.
It's not a question
of whether or not it works.

88
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:51,041
The question is, are we
willing to fight to protect it?

89
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:55,041
And I think that we should.
Am I wrong?

90
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,000
An emergency
at the hospital.

91
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,375

92
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,542
You okay?

93
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,041
This job is...

94
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:13,917

95
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:16,917

96
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:18,959
This job is my whole life.

97
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,041
What do we got?

98
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,792
32-year-old Caucasian female,
sustained blunt trauma

99
00:05:25,834 --> 00:05:28,166
and possible kidney injury
from a sexual assault.

100
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:31,166

to look at her, it's just that

101
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,792
you were signed up with
the rape crisis team and--

102
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,417
what's her name?
Kaitlin mills.

103
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:38,834
Hi, Kaitlin.

104
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,834
I'm Dr. King.

105
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,291
Are they still out there?

106
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,083
The police?

107
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,208
Don't worry about them.

108
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,083
They want me
to talk to them...

109
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:53,041
But I can't.

110
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:56,667
Can I take a look at you?

111
00:05:56,709 --> 00:06:00,041
There we go. Easy.

112
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,875
When can I go home?

113
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:11,041
Uh... there's blood
in your urine...

114
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:14,250
Which means
there's possible kidney damage.

115
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:17,125
We need to get a scan.

116
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,458
You're gonna have to stay here
a few days for observation.

117
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,041
I need to do a pelvic exam.

118
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,250
We should also do
a rape kit.

119
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,250
No.
I know this is difficult--

120
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,291
You don't know.

121
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:29,917
Don't stand there

122
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:32,917
with your fake,
practiced doctor compassion,

123
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,083
l-like you know
what this is like.

124
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,917
I'm not gonna lay here
and...

125
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:43,041
Let you--no.

126
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,583
No rape kit.

127
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:50,250
Of course.

128
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:52,375
No rape kit.

129
00:06:52,417 --> 00:06:55,709
Let's just get you admitted.

130
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,083
What happened?

131
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:04,041
Routine examination.
She started seizing.
Epileptic?

132
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,500
Juvenile krabbe's disease.
She already had

133
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:09,417
marked deterioration
of her neurological system.
Marisa, mommy's here, okay?

134
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:12,333
Mommy's here.
This is our fault. We reduced
her meds this month.

135
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:15,250
The sedatives
were making her a zombie.

136
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,333
Okay, lorazepam's on board.
Phenytoin going in.

137
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,125
Let's turn her.
Get her over.

138
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:22,083
Oh, wait. Wait, wait.

139
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,041
She's breathing again.

140
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,542
Oh, thank god.

141
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,500
She gonna be okay?
For now.

142
00:07:27,542 --> 00:07:30,041
She was healthy
until about the age of 3.

143
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,417
Um, she's lost most of hearing,
part of her vision,

144
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,417
and she's slowly losing
the ability

145
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,458
to control her own movements.
Prognosis?

146
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,875
Six months to a year.
I've been trying
to help them to adjust,

147
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,041
but how do you
get someone to accept

148
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:44,083
that a disease
is killing their child?
You know, I remember reading
about a case like this.

149
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,709
Haven't they had some success

150
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,083
transfusing hematopoietic
stem cells

151
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,083
to slow the progress
of the disease?

152
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,500
Yeah, I read that, too,
the problem is, it has never

153
00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:53,959
been used on someone whose
illness is this far advanced.
Even so,

154
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,458
if there's a chance that
we could buy her some real time,

155
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,959
where she's not getting worse,
isn't that worth a shot?
It could exacerbate the damage
that's already been done.

156
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,959
That would give Marisa
even less time.

157
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,083
So what do we do?

158
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,041
Poor Violet.

159
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:12,041
Poor us.
God. Can't you believe
this is happening?

160
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,083
It'll all end up fine,
right?

161
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:17,709
I mean, the worst has
already happened, hasn't it?
I hope so.

162
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,417
Fife is leaving.

163
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,834
Yeah?

164
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,834
Without me, which is...
Which is how it has to be.

165
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,834
I mean, I can't go with him.

166
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,917
I... I have Betsey,

167
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,500
and she needs me.

168
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:32,041
I need to devote all my time
to her, right?

169
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:33,709
I don't think I'm qualified

170
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,709
to give advice
on relationships.

171
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,041
I mean, after Sam? You know,
I was in the grocery store.

172
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:40,041
I tried flirting with this guy
the other day,

173
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:43,041
and the best I could
come up with was...

174
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,792
"How do you tell
if these things are ripe?"

175
00:08:45,834 --> 00:08:48,458
Like some kind of freak or--
Dr. Montgomery, Neal chaplin
from the medical board.

176
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,542
We spoke--
yes, I know who you are.
This is the guy

177
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:54,250
who interviewed me when Violet
was being investigated.
How can we help you?

178
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,250
As part of the medical board's
investigation

179
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,959
into this practice, I'm going to
need to sit down with

180
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,875
each of the doctors here and do
a comprehensive interview.
Wait.

181
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:04,667
Do we have to
talk to this guy?
No, absolutely not.

182
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:07,041
You could call your lawyers,
consult, and then we could

183
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,959
start the process of setting up
times which are convenient

184
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,250
for them and for me
and for all of you.

185
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,250
That could be
extremely time-consuming.

186
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,875
Please don't come into
our office and threaten us.

187
00:09:16,917 --> 00:09:19,291
I have a job to do,
but I'd be happy to start

188
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:22,041
by sending in a team
to copy all of your files.

189
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,083
And judging
by what we've gotten

190
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:26,875
from our review
of Dr. Turner's records, uh,

191
00:09:26,917 --> 00:09:28,875
we should have plenty
to work with.

192
00:09:28,917 --> 00:09:30,875
Okay, uh, with all
due respect, Mr. Chaplin,

193
00:09:30,917 --> 00:09:34,458
you need to turn around and get
the hell out of our office.

194
00:09:45,834 --> 00:09:48,041
Sam, you didn't have to tell
the investigator off.

195
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,875
You think that helped?
Look, he came in here,
into our office,

196
00:09:50,917 --> 00:09:52,875
and tried to push us around.
Y-Yes, it helps us.

197
00:09:52,917 --> 00:09:55,083
We're still gonna have to
talk to him.
All you did
was make him mad, Sam.

198
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:57,542
Neither one of you understand
what's happening here.

199
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,959
That man is a shark,
and he is circling us.

200
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,417
If we give up, then that--that's
blood in the water. We're dead.

201
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:05,291
We may be dead anyway.
No, we need to fight.

202
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,959
We need to stand up
and fight for this practice.

203
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,333
How come nobody wants
to fight for the...
We could call our lawyers,
get their advice.

204
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:14,125
Yes, but whatever they say,
we do,

205
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:17,166
even if they tell us
not to fight.

206
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,333
I could use
an a.A. Meeting.

207
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,000
Want to join me?

208
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,375
I'm waiting on a motorcyclist
too cool for a helmet.

209
00:10:28,417 --> 00:10:30,375
Oh.
What about after work?

210
00:10:30,417 --> 00:10:33,458
I'll wait for you.
I'll go with you tomorrow,
okay?

211
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,792
Like you were gonna
go with me yesterday?

212
00:10:35,834 --> 00:10:37,792
You've had
a lot of excuses lately.

213
00:10:37,834 --> 00:10:39,792
Charlotte, I have a mother,
a good mother.

214
00:10:39,834 --> 00:10:42,041
Let her do her job.

215
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:44,667
Let's go to a meeting
tomorrow morning on Montana.

216
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,125
She does it so fast,

217
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:57,041
sometimes I can't even
keep up.

218
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:59,041
I didn't know
you knew sign language.

219
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:02,709
It helps to know a little bit
for my deaf patients.

220
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,000
Oh, ha ha ha ha.

221
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,375
So this, um, p-procedure,

222
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:10,709
how much more time
would it give Marisa?

223
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,709
Well, it's impossible
to say.

224
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,041
But studies suggest
that it could give her

225
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,709
an extra two or three years.
Th-that's amazing.

226
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,333
That's amazing.

227
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,917
Didn't you hear them?

228
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,917
I heard them,
but they also said

229
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,083
that they weren't sure
it would work

230
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,041
and that
it could make her worse.

231
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:35,625
The idea of more time
with her... Jason--

232
00:11:35,667 --> 00:11:38,208
if this were your child,
Dr. Wilder,

233
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,041
would you risk the time you knew
you had left with her?

234
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,041
Well, this is
a very personal decision,

235
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,041
and it's really not relevant
what Dr. Wilder

236
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,417
or anybody else would do.

237
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,875
It's all about how prepared
your family is emotionally

238
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:52,041
to deal with the outcome of
this, you know, whatever it is.

239
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,041
What did she say?
She wants to know

240
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:56,417
when she can go home
and sleep in her own bed.

241
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:11,792
Do you come here every night?

242
00:12:11,834 --> 00:12:13,792
I couldn't get the idea
of fresh pineapple

243
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:15,291
out of my mind.

244
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,041
What about you?

245
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:20,291
Do you--do you come here
every night?

246
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,041
No.

247
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:25,083
I lied.

248
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:28,000
I hate pineapples.

249
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,041
So...

250
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,500
Tell me about yourself.

251
00:12:33,542 --> 00:12:37,625
Well, I...

252
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:40,041
Let's not.

253
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:43,041
Oh. Okay.

254
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,500
No. I mean--

255
00:12:44,542 --> 00:12:47,041
look, I-I could tell you
about my ex-boyfriend,

256
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,500
my dating history,
what's going on at work.

257
00:12:49,542 --> 00:12:52,917
I could tell you
all of that, but...

258
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,333
Let's make a change.

259
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,125
You want to make a change?

260
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:59,667
Yeah. I don't want to do any of
the things that I usually do--

261
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:01,667
no drama, no games,
no history.

262
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:04,917
Just you and me
in the present,

263
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,875
start clean.

264
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:08,250
Is that weird?

265
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:11,166
No. Not at all.

266
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,875
Okay.

267
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:16,583
No histories,
no names,

268
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:19,000
just... here and now.

269
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:24,959
What, is there...
Do I have some--

270
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:30,709
I'm just wondering what it might
be like to kiss those lips.

271
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,875
Oh.

272
00:13:32,917 --> 00:13:35,667
Oh, no. We can't do that.

273
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:39,375
I-I don't even know
your name.
Hey, you set the rules.

274
00:13:39,417 --> 00:13:41,458
Yeah, but we're in public.

275
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,125
We're in the present.

276
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:17,875
Best date ever, so far.

277
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,041
Missed you at the meeting
this morning.

278
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,667
Yeah, I was wiped out
from being on call.

279
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:33,667
I heard it was pretty slow
at the hospital last night.

280
00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:36,959
Okay, um, we just got off
the phone with the lawyers,

281
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,667
and they felt strongly
that we need to be proactive

282
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:41,667
about protecting ourselves
as best we can.

283
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:44,333
What does that mean?
It means that we have to start

284
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,458
by going back through
all of our files,

285
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,125
making lists of patients
we consulted each other about,

286
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,917
and then we need to
separate out the instances

287
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:53,709
when the advice was medical

288
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,083
from those where we just
debated each other for sport.
That is not what we do.

289
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:58,166
Which is exactly
what I said.

290
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:00,792
- Sam, we said we would listen to the lawyers.
- And then what?

291
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:03,041
We're gonna just sit back
and let them pick us apart?

292
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,834
Well, look, we pushed
back as hard as we could.
And the bottom line is,

293
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:09,208
the practice is already
a target of the medical board.
They don't care about truth.

294
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,041
They don't care that we're
trying to help people.

295
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:13,667
You know, I'm just saying.

296
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:16,041
The lawyers gave us two choices.
Either we figure out

297
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,041
every single point
of vulnerability now

298
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,583
and prepare
to defend ourselves.
Or?

299
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,583
We dissolve the practice,
go our separate ways,

300
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:26,041
and hope that the medical board
or the lawyers

301
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:29,041
don't come after us
individually.

302
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,041
How's it going?

303
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:39,083
I'm doing good.

304
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,500
Good.

305
00:15:40,542 --> 00:15:42,500
Well, not exactly good,

306
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:45,458
because now I may not have
a job to go to,

307
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,041
and everything is a mess,
but...

308
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,500
I met a guy...

309
00:15:50,542 --> 00:15:53,542
Over a pineapple.

310
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,542
And that makes you
feel better?

311
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:58,500
♪ set a still frame in my mind ♪

312
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:01,583
It makes me feel like
my life is changing.

313
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,583
♪ It's time ♪

314
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,250
♪ to go ♪

315
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:10,000
♪ it's time ♪

316
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:12,709
♪ oh ♪

317
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,917
I shouldn't even be here.

318
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,083
Well, apparently,
none of us should be.

319
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,500
No, I mean, I just...
I'm not even a doctor anymore.

320
00:16:20,542 --> 00:16:22,083
You're still a doctor.

321
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:25,041
I can't practice medicine.
That's not a doctor. That's...

322
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,542
Nothing. I'm nothing.

323
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:30,000
Come on. You're a wife.
You're a mother.

324
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,792
That...

325
00:16:31,834 --> 00:16:33,709
I help people, Pete.

326
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,291
It's who I am.

327
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:38,500
So... yeah, yeah,
I guess I could learn

328
00:16:38,542 --> 00:16:41,083
to bake bread
and go to playgroups

329
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,917
and learn how to quilt,

330
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:46,917
and I guess everything
would be fine for a while,

331
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,291
but that's not me.

332
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,291
You know
that's not me, Pete.

333
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:53,083
I... I would get sad
and dark.

334
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,500
And why is that
good for Lucas?

335
00:16:55,542 --> 00:16:58,125
Dark mommy
with a drink in her hand.

336
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:00,667
No,
I'm just saying that...

337
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:02,583
My identity
is what I do.

338
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:05,041
I need to work to feel alive.

339
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,667
What are you trying
to say, Violet?

340
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:10,250
My publisher has been after me
for a while to do a book tour.

341
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,250
And I think
I should do that now.

342
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:15,041
A book tour?
Three weeks.

343
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,041
Four tops. I could
bring Lucas and a nanny.

344
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,041
I could help people
through my book.

345
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:22,041
I think that's a good idea.
You can't just run away
from your problems--

346
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,041
I know that, Pete.
I'm a shrink.

347
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:27,041
Oh, wait. I'm not anymore,
which is the point!

348
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,041
Just...

349
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:32,000
Think about it, okay?

350
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,458
A-A book tour now?
Are you kidding?

351
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:57,041
I mean, she needs to stay here
and fight this thing.

352
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:59,375
Man, you gotta get her
to stay and fight.
She's upset. She's devastated.

353
00:17:59,417 --> 00:18:01,709
I don't know how I would feel
if my license was suspended,

354
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:05,041
but this is such a bad idea.
How does she not see that?
Because she's Violet.

355
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,041
All right.
Starting the chemo infusion.

356
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:09,041
I mean, she blames herself

357
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:12,333
for what's going on
at the practice, but that--

358
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:13,959
Her pressure's dropping.

359
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:19,041
Marisa had
a severe allergic reaction

360
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:20,625
to the medication.

361
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:22,625
We were able
to resuscitate her,

362
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:24,959
but... she was deprived
of oxygen

363
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,959
for a significant period
of time.

364
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,750
She may have sustained
additional brain damage.

365
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:31,709
I'm very sorry.
Oh, god.

366
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,291
I'm very sorry.

367
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,458
But she's going to
wake up, right?

368
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,875
She's only
minimally functional,

369
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:40,041
and she's not going to get
any better.

370
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,625
No.

371
00:18:42,667 --> 00:18:44,417
This can't be happening.

372
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:48,041
This morning we could talk
to her, and now...

373
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:50,250
The two of you
pushed us to do this.

374
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:53,250
Now you took my girl from me.

375
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:56,041
I'll go after him.
No, I will.

376
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,917
Oh.

377
00:18:57,959 --> 00:19:01,000
Kinda quiet around here.

378
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:03,917
What did you do to
all the, you know, patients?

379
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:05,667
I thought you left.

380
00:19:05,709 --> 00:19:08,041
I almost did.
I just thought...

381
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,917
Look, I'm not gonna say
all the mushy things again.

382
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:14,041
But I'm taking one more shot.

383
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:16,917
I am leaving tomorrow.
Come with me.

384
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:18,333
Gabriel, I...

385
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,125
The practice
is falling apart,

386
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,041
and I can't uproot Betsey

387
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,083
before I've even
gotten her settled.

388
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:27,125
You could. If you wanted to,
you could.

389
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,500
Okay.

390
00:19:31,542 --> 00:19:34,041
Nice knowing you, Naomi.

391
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,041
I'm not the kind of man--

392
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:45,041
I've never talked
to my wife like that,

393
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:48,208
much less the doctors trying
to take care of my daughter.

394
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,041
It's okay.

395
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,125
No, it's not.
None of it is.

396
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:55,417
I shouldn't have dropped
my guard.

397
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,792
I shouldn't have let myself
imagine a future

398
00:19:57,834 --> 00:19:59,792
where I could teach my girl

399
00:19:59,834 --> 00:20:02,041
how to ride a bike
and how to drive a car.

400
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,875
I want to blame someone,

401
00:20:03,917 --> 00:20:06,250
but that
won't change anything.

402
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,875
I can't watch my baby
or Angela suffer anymore.

403
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,458
I can't.

404
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,417
Isn't there another way,
a more humane way to treat her?

405
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,041
I'm sorry, Jason.

406
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:19,041
I can't imagine
how difficult it is for you,

407
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,834
but we've run out
of medical options.

408
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,458
That's not what I'm asking.

409
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,500
I want you to help me
end Marisa's suffering.

410
00:20:36,709 --> 00:20:39,709
So I had coffee
with pineapple guy.

411
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:43,041
And I kissed him...

412
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:46,458
Which I have decided
is a good thing.

413
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,458
It's new, so...

414
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,458
Right?

415
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,667
What?

416
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:55,834
Fife came back.

417
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:59,250
And he asked me to go away
with him... again.

418
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,041
And you said?

419
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,875
No, again.

420
00:21:02,917 --> 00:21:04,458
You could go.

421
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,041
Start fresh.
Change your life.

422
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,041
I can't.

423
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,250
I can't.
I have to be responsible.

424
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,083
I'm the responsible one.

425
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,041
I... I can't leave,

426
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,041
not with the practice
in a mess,

427
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:20,041
and I can't abandon the practice
and I can't abandon you guys--

428
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:23,208
and--and Maya. Did I tell you
she got into Columbia?

429
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,625
What?

430
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:27,083
She got into Columbia,
and she wants to go.

431
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:30,041
How am I supposed
to help her with that--

432
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,041
going to college with a baby--
and Betsey--

433
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,959
I mean, I-I know I owe it to her
to give her the stability

434
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,959
that poor child
has never managed to have.

435
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,959
I mean, i--why can't he
understand that?

436
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,333
Why can't he understand that i'm
just trying to be responsible?

437
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,875
What--what's...
What's going on there

438
00:21:46,917 --> 00:21:49,250
with your face?

439
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:52,041
I'm just trying not to cry.

440
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:54,875
Oh. All right.

441
00:21:54,917 --> 00:21:57,542
For the next ten minutes...

442
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:01,041
I'm gonna be
the responsible one,

443
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:03,000
and you go ahead...

444
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:04,792
And cry.

445
00:22:04,834 --> 00:22:07,291
Go ahead.

446
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:09,500
It's okay.

447
00:22:09,542 --> 00:22:11,667
You cry.

448
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:17,166
I'm here.

449
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,500
Hey.

450
00:22:32,542 --> 00:22:36,083
So this whole thing that's
going on with the practice...

451
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:37,083
Yeah.

452
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:38,709
Right? I mean...

453
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:41,667
I mean, there's gotta be
some way we can win this.

454
00:22:41,709 --> 00:22:43,542
I can't stop thinking
about it.

455
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:45,542
Do you want to grab dinner
or something

456
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:49,250
and try to figure
this whole thing out?
I have somewhere to go.

457
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:51,041
I have a date.

458
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:53,250
Oh.

459
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:54,875
Oh.

460
00:22:54,917 --> 00:22:56,375
I'm sorry.

461
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:59,375
I didn't want to lie.
No, it's fine.
I totally--i get it.

462
00:22:59,417 --> 00:23:01,458
Uh...
No, go. Go have fun.

463
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,083
Go have fun on your date.

464
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,834
Maybe we shouldn't
fight it, Sam.

465
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:12,917
Maybe we should
let the practice die

466
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:15,000
and just go
our separate ways.

467
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:33,917
I have an 8-year-old girl

468
00:23:33,959 --> 00:23:36,291
who's gone from smiling
and signing this morning

469
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:38,667
to a permanent
vegetative state,

470
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:41,542
and her father wants me to...

471
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,458
He wants me to euthanize her.

472
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,500
And I swear to god,
Charlotte,

473
00:23:47,542 --> 00:23:49,333
I'm seriously considering it.

474
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:55,917
For the last two days...

475
00:23:55,959 --> 00:23:59,083
I've been dealing
with a patient who was raped.

476
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:01,083
They brought her in

477
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:03,959
looking exactly like
the way I felt--

478
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,875
just... wrecked.

479
00:24:06,917 --> 00:24:09,250
I'm not like Violet.

480
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:12,041
I can't share everything
about my personal life

481
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,625
with people.

482
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:15,625
I'm never gonna write
a book.

483
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:17,625
That's not how I'm built.

484
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:21,166
But here, even though
I wanted to say something,

485
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:23,709
knew I should...

486
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,291
I couldn't.

487
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:27,291
I just folded up.

488
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:29,959
I'm sorry.

489
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,959
I didn't tell you
to make you feel bad.

490
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,083
I told you because...
I don't know either.

491
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:39,083
I guess I'm looking...

492
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:41,709
For the same thing
you are.

493
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:44,500
What's that?

494
00:24:46,083 --> 00:24:48,792
Someone to tell me
how hard to push,

495
00:24:48,834 --> 00:24:51,333
how to untangle
my patient's best interest

496
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:53,792
from my own.

497
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:59,083
How do we do this?

498
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:01,917
I think...

499
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:04,333
We do
what we've always done.

500
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:06,959
We put our patient's needs
ahead of everything else.

501
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
We take care of our patients.

502
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:12,917
Yeah.

503
00:25:12,959 --> 00:25:15,583
So I'm guessing lawyer.
I'm not a lawyer.

504
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:18,041
Anthropologist.
That would be fun,
but no.

505
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:21,000
And stop with the 20 questions.
I thought we both agreed.

506
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:23,750
We're gonna have to tell
each other who we are

507
00:25:23,792 --> 00:25:26,166
sooner or later.
On our next date,
I promise.

508
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:29,000
I don't know if I can wait
two whole weeks.
Two--what--two weeks?

509
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:31,166
We have to wait two weeks
for our next date?

510
00:25:31,208 --> 00:25:33,166
I am taking
a much-deserved vacation--

511
00:25:33,208 --> 00:25:34,875
14 days in Fiji...

512
00:25:34,917 --> 00:25:38,041
White sand, blue water.
Oh, I'm jealous.

513
00:25:38,083 --> 00:25:41,375
Well, you should be. But hey,
I'll bring you back a gift.

514
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:46,000
Or you could come with me.

515
00:25:47,417 --> 00:25:49,041
Oh, right.

516
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:50,667
No, I'm serious.

517
00:25:50,709 --> 00:25:52,792
We could spend our days

518
00:25:52,834 --> 00:25:54,792
telling each other
our life stories.

519
00:25:54,834 --> 00:25:57,333
We could spend our nights

Hey. You don't look so good.

527

Oh, I've felt better.
Where's Lucas?

528
00:26:21,208 --> 00:26:22,792
He's already sleeping.

No, I'm fine.
I just...

531
00:26:26,834 --> 00:26:29,041
I had a tough a day.

532

534
00:26:33,917 --> 00:26:35,041
Yes.

535
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:40,041
Um... I have thought
about it, and...

536
00:26:40,083 --> 00:26:42,041
I-I need to do this.

537
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:44,959
Does it matter
what I think?

538
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,959
Of course it matters
what you think.

539
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,959
But I'm hoping
that what you'll think is,

540
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,333
your wife needs this,
and because she needs it,

541
00:26:51,375 --> 00:26:53,041
you'll support her.

542
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:54,834
That's not what I think.

543
00:26:54,875 --> 00:26:57,667
Okay. What do you think?
I think you're being selfish.

544
00:26:57,709 --> 00:27:00,750
Okay.
This is about what you need.
It's not about what Lucas needs.

545
00:27:00,792 --> 00:27:03,458
It's not about what I need.
It's about you.
Well, this book
is important to me.

546
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,041
This book is tearing
our practice apart.

547
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:10,083
Do you want it to tear
our family apart, too?
Okay, now you're blaming
the book... the one thing--

548
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:14,041
the one good thing that came
from Katie slicing me open--
Lucas is the one good thing--

549
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:16,583
you know what I mean.
I don't want you to go.

550
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:19,667
It's only for three weeks,
and Lucas can come with me.
Lucas is not going.

551
00:27:19,709 --> 00:27:22,041
He can stay here if that's
easier for you. We can make

552
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:25,291
that work, too. Pete, I do not
want to make you unhappy, but--
I swear, Violet,
if you run away again--

553
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:27,500
again?
You dropped Lucas in my lap
and you ran!

554
00:27:27,542 --> 00:27:31,917
Because I needed to!
Okay, once again...
This is not just about you!

555
00:27:31,959 --> 00:27:33,875
If you run--

556
00:27:33,917 --> 00:27:35,250
just stop it, Pete.

557
00:27:35,291 --> 00:27:37,250
Just stop it.
Don't say anything else,

558
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:39,875
because what is about to come
out of your mouth right now

559
00:27:39,917 --> 00:27:41,291
sounds like an ultimatum,

560
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:43,291

to ultimatums.

you. I know you are triggered.

563

But this isn't the same.
So please just--

564
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:51,625
don't say anything.
Don't do this to us.

565
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:55,291
