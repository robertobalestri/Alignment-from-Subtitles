00:00:15,041 --> 00:00:17,542
Welcome home, stranger.
How was Seattle?

4
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:19,500
It was good.

5
00:00:19,542 --> 00:00:22,041
It's always a little weird
going back, but it was good.

6
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,625
Uh, your brother says hello.
Mm. How's Derek?

7
00:00:24,667 --> 00:00:26,208
He's, uh...

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,625
Derek?

9
00:00:27,667 --> 00:00:29,542
If you and Sam have time
for breakfast,

10
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:32,041
I can scramble up
a few more eggs.

11
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:34,041
Um...

12
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:37,041
Sam's not here.
Good not here,

13
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:39,041
like you're making him wait
to see you

14
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:41,041
because it's extra hot
to delay homecoming sex,

15
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:44,041
or bad not here,
like things are not good?
I gave him a choice
before I left.

16
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:47,041
I said, we either have a baby
or we end things.

17
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:50,750
Wow. Uh, and?

18
00:00:50,792 --> 00:00:53,041
And, uh,
he thought it was best

19
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:56,500
to stay at his place
until he makes his decision.

20
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:01,208
Yay for love.

21
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,792
Right?

22
00:01:02,834 --> 00:01:06,834
Why aren't you ready to go?
We're already late.

23
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:09,041
These wedding invitations were
supposed to go out a week ago.

24
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:11,625
Why didn't you send 'em?
I'll start on 'em today,
okay?

25
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:14,625
No, not okay. We're falling
behind. If you had sent them,

26
00:01:14,667 --> 00:01:17,041
I could've told my mother it was
too late to invite aunt Zelda,

27
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:19,041
but now she apologized
to my mother

28
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:21,166
for saying that her brisket
was too tough,

29
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:23,792
and now we have to invite her.
Fine. She can sit next to
buster Hodges.

30
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:26,750
Uncle on big daddy's side.
Mama wants to add him.

31
00:01:26,792 --> 00:01:28,750
Where would one find
a buster Hodges?

32
00:01:28,792 --> 00:01:30,750
Oneonta, Alabama.

33
00:01:30,792 --> 00:01:34,041
I'm sure his address
is in my old book.

34
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:36,041
Here.

35
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:37,709
Wow. Did that come

36
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,417
with your, uh, trapper keeper
in eighth grade?

37
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:43,917
Coming from the man who still
has a magic wand collection.

38
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:47,291
Wh--oh, sweet mother.
Who's this guy?

39
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:49,291
It's no one.
Whoa.
No one that you kept...

40
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:52,542
Come on.
In your...
20-year-old address book?

41
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:54,083
It's Billy.

42
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:56,709
Ex-husband Billy?

43
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:00,792
Why'd you keep that?

44
00:02:00,834 --> 00:02:04,583
The man cheated on me.
I hate him for it. End of story.

45
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,166
I just--i don't...

46
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:09,250
Get why you keep a picture
of somebody you hate.

47
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:12,250
You seriously want to
discuss this?
You made me throw out pictures
of every girl I ever looked at,

48
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:15,125
and I did it because I assumed,
if I didn't,

49
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:18,166
it would make you feel like
I still had feelings for them.

50
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:25,125
Okay.

51
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:27,542
Fine.

52
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:51,041
Hey.

53
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,500
Hi.

54
00:02:52,542 --> 00:02:54,166
You're--you're back.

55
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:57,041
Yes, last night, late. I'm--
I would've called, but--

56
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,375
no, no, no, no.

57
00:02:59,417 --> 00:03:00,834
I missed you.

58
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:03,583
I--hey. Yeah.

59
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:06,417
I missed you, too.

60
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:09,041
How was, uh,
how was your trip?

61
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,333
It was good.
Yeah, it was good.

62
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:14,125
Look, Sam, the--
I w--sorry.

63
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,834
You go.

64
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:19,041
What you asked me before
you left...

65
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,625
I know that you expect
an answer,

66
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:23,750
and...

67
00:03:23,792 --> 00:03:25,750
I just don't have one yet.

68
00:03:25,792 --> 00:03:28,834
You need to decide.

69
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,792
And in the meantime?

70
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:36,041
You have a singles table
when you're 25

71
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,041
and still want
to set your friends up.

72
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,500
I'm just saying,
if bubba's coming alone--

73
00:03:40,542 --> 00:03:43,625
his name's buster.
Whatever. If he's coming alone,
and aunt Zelda is coming alone--

74
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:45,500
are we allowed to bring
a date to your wedding?

75
00:03:45,542 --> 00:03:47,583
No.
Sure.

76
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,291
Yet another advantage
to being married--

77
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:52,041
not having to fly solo
at your friend's wedding.
Mm. Amen.

78
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:55,041
Amelia, if there's somebody
that you'd really like to bring,

79
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,583
it's fine.
Sheldon,
are you bringing anyone?

80
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:00,000
You mean, do I have
someone special

81
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:02,583
that I really want to bring,
someone I'm happily dating,

82
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,583
perhaps a fellow therapist/
book reviewer?

83
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,041
Unfortunately, no, I don't.

84
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,041
Well, you like southern accents,
don't you, Sheldon?

85
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,500
I'm sure Charlotte has some
friends that you could date.

86
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:13,166
Yes, and some of them
even have all their teeth.

87
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,542
I swear, Cooper--
hey. Good morning.

88
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:18,417
Hey, you're back.
How was your trip?
Hey.

89
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,542
It was good. You know,
I managed to safely deliver

90
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,542
the baby of an old friend,
and, yeah,

91
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,333
ended on a high note.

92
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,333
Excuse me, I'm looking
for Dr. Violet Turner.

93
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,041
Uh, I'm Dr. Turner,

94
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:30,041
but our receptionist
signs for all the packages.

95
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,625
I don't need a signature.

96
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:33,875
You've just been served.
Have a great day.

97
00:04:40,542 --> 00:04:43,625
"Liability for breach
of confidentiality."

98
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:47,041
"Recently published book

99
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:49,667
"violates continued duty

in regard to plaintiff."

101
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,959
That's crazy.
Who would sue you for that?

102
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:03,041
The woman who attacked me.
I'm being sued by Katie.

103
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:06,041
Katie.
The plaintiff is Katie.

104
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:09,667
"After 18 months
of psychiatric care,

105
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,667
plaintiff
now emotionally stable"--

106
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:14,083
she attacked Violet
and they let her go?

107
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:16,917
After only 18 months,
they let her go,

108
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:19,458
and now she does this?
"Book is inhibiting
the progress

109
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,542
of plaintiff's
continued mental recovery."

110
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:24,792
Okay, this has gotta be
some kind of joke.
It doesn't sound
very funny to me.

111
00:05:24,834 --> 00:05:27,291
No, it's not funny.
"Seeks immediate cessation
of publication,

112
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:30,291
marketing, and sales
of aforementioned book."

113
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:33,041
She's demanding you take
your book off the shelves?

114
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,291
Ugh. I'm sorry. I-I have to
deal with a patient.

115
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,834
Uh, vi, if you need
anything from me, okay?

116
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:40,000
It's just been so long,

117
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,000
I thought Katie was gone
from my life forever.

118
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,542
Well, they can't seriously think
you have a responsibility

119
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:47,000
in her recovery
after almost two years.
Of course not.

120
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:49,542
She's your attacker.
You owe her nothing.
It's not that simple.

121
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,542
Doctors have certain
obligations to their patients

122
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,750
even after they finish
caring for them.
No, those rights disappeared

123
00:05:53,792 --> 00:05:56,750
when she walked into
our living room and--
Pete.

124
00:05:56,792 --> 00:05:59,041
No, she's a criminal!
She should've been put away

125
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:01,542
for the rest of her life.
I agree. No court is gonna
side with her on this.

126
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:05,583
This is ridiculous. I'm gonna
get our lawyer on the phone.

127
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,583
Pete. Hang on.
Back off, Sheldon.

128
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:11,041
Even though Violet changed
Katie's name in the book,

129
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,458
she does still talk about
Katie's personal trauma--
what are you saying?

130
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,458
That anyone who's seen
the local news

131
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,041
or read a paper or uses Google
is gonna know

132
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,542
that Katie's the one that
Violet's been talking about.
Are you siding with Katie?

133
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:23,041
Of course not, but we have to
consider for a moment

134
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,750
that the doctor-patient
confidentiality

135
00:06:24,792 --> 00:06:26,583
might have been violated.

136
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,625
Violet is not
necessarily innocent here.

137
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:30,083
I did nothing wrong.

138
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:33,000
And shame on you
for saying otherwise.

139
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:41,041
Val. Hey. We didn't have
an appointment today, did we?

140
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:43,041
Uh, it's not a baby thing.

141
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:45,041
Dr. Bennett was doing
his routine checkup,

142
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:48,000
and he noticed my glands were
swollen, so he did a biopsy.

143
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,500
He said
it's probably nothing,

144
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,500
but just in case,
I've made it very clear

145
00:06:51,542 --> 00:06:54,417
who Gary can and cannot marry
the second time around.
There's a list.

146
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:57,458
Hey, guys. I, uh,
I have val's results.

147
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,583
You want to step
into my office?

148
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:03,959
That can't be good.

149
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,208
Uh, val has
Burkitt's lymphoma.

150
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,000
That's cancer
of the lymphatic system.

151
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,417
How...
How bad is it?

152
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,709
Well, given that there
was no evidence of it

153
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,709
on her last visit,
it means it is aggressive,

154
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,208
so we should get you
into the hospital right away

155
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,917
and do some more testing.

156
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:33,041
This can't be happening.

157
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,041
Honey, what do you always
tell me?

158
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,917
Don't borrow trouble.

159
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,041
We can fight this.

160
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:42,125
So what, surgery?

161
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,125
Well,
with this type of cancer,

162
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:46,542
surgery and radiation
are not viable options.

163
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,041
Chemo has proven effective,

164
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,875
but cannot be administered
while you're pregnant.

165
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:54,500
Okay, so i-in a few months--
no, we don't have
that kind of time.

166
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:57,750
We should deliver the baby
right away.
I'm only at 25 weeks.

167
00:07:57,792 --> 00:08:00,667
I know,
but the baby is viable.

168
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,959
Dr. Bennett,
you don't agree?

169
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,041
Well, if you deliver
your son now,

170
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,041
uh, he's likely to have
serious health problems--

171
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:12,542
neurological, muscular,
his sight could be impaired--

172
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:15,041
and that's assuming
that he survives.
He could die?

173
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,500
Yes, but so could you.
Val...

174
00:08:17,542 --> 00:08:19,834
I know that this is
a horrible choice

175
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,542
to have to make, but--

176
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:24,834
there is no choice.
We can try again.

177
00:08:26,417 --> 00:08:29,083
But right now,
we've gotta worry about you.

178
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,542
No.
Y--

179
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,583
not this time.

180
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:36,750
After all the miscarriages
and leaving work and bed rest...

181
00:08:36,792 --> 00:08:38,792
We did everything
we were supposed to do--

182
00:08:38,834 --> 00:08:40,583
everything.

183
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:44,041
We can't start over now.

184
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:47,125
Maybe we should take some time
and think about this.

185
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,625
No.

186
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:50,625
I'm carrying this baby
to term.

187
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:53,041
I choose him...

188
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:56,000
Even if it kills me.

189
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,041
Sam, we always save
the mother first.

190
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:06,041
Val is making
the wrong choice here,

191
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,792
and her cancer
is spreading fast.

192
00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:11,166
Maybe, but every day makes
a huge difference to this baby.

193
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,625
Right now
his lungs haven't matured.

194
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:16,041
His visual and auditory systems
are still developing.

195
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,917
But if we wait
just two weeks,

196
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,041
the chances of him surviving
increase 80%.

197
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,041
In two weeks,
val will be much worse.

198
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,000
She's becoming hypermetabolic,

199
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:27,041
and the cancer is already
overtaking her system.

200
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,917
Guys, hang on. If this woman
were hemorrhaging

201
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:31,667
and a split-second decision
needed to be made,

202
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:34,041
it would be a no-brainer, but in
this case, she's conscious.

203
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,041
I mean, she's aware.
It's her body.
Thank you.

204
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,166
It's her life. If she wants to
give it up for her baby,

205
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:41,083
that is her choice.
Without intravenous
or intrathecal chemo

206
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:44,500
administered immediately,
val will die.

207
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,500
Okay. So let me understand.

208
00:09:46,542 --> 00:09:48,542
You're saying that
even though this woman

209
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:52,291
has explicitly stated the fact
that she wants to have a child,

210
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:55,542
no matter what the cost--
Sam--

211
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:58,709
you're suggesting
that we disregard that.
It is not the same.

212
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,208
Well, from my perspective
in this situation,

213
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,250
there's nothing left
to be said.

214
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,417
So I talked to the lawyer.

215
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,500
He thinks Katie
might have a case.

216
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,125
What are you doing?

217
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,667
I'm gonna find every reference
to Katie in the book,

218
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:22,041
and I'm gonna figure out
if I violated any privilege.

219
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:25,000
Look, I don't want you to worry
about this. We're gonna fight--
I can handle this, Pete.

220
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,542
Just give a minute
to figure out what the hell...

221
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,041
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

222
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,375
I just never expected this
to happen.

223
00:10:31,417 --> 00:10:34,041
How could you?
I mean, I-I didn't do
anything wrong.

224
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:37,083
I didn't do anything
to hurt Katie.

225
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,792
And yet...

226
00:10:39,834 --> 00:10:41,917
I think
I should go talk to her.

227
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:45,041
No. Absolutely not.
She's dangerous.

228
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:48,041
Maybe we could come
to some kind of understanding.
Oh, for god sake, Violet.
That's why we have

229
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,583
a restraining order
against her in the first place.

230
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,583
Pete, she's not gonna be
the same Katie.

231
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,542
I mean, no,
if they're letting her out,

232
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,125
that means
she's done a lot of work

233
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,041
and she's ready
to reintegrate.

234
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:01,041
I'm sure she has a therapist
and a drug regimen and...
Violet--

235
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:04,041
she'll be closer to the Katie
I knew when I worked with her.
Yeah, and look how well
that turned out.

236
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:07,041
She knows me. Pete, no.
And whatever else has happened,

237
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,041
that doctor-patient dynamic
is still in place,

238
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:12,041
and that means maybe
I could get through to her.
Let the lawyers handle it.

239
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:15,041
No, that's just gonna
alienate her even more.
Violet, remember when you told
me to sit down with my mother

240
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,792
and make amends
before she died?

241
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:20,291
I was not there yet,
but I trusted you.

242
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,041
Please trust me.

243
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:25,041
No matter what you say to her,
it's not gonna change things.

244
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,041
It's just
gonna make things worse.

245
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:30,875
I'm telling you,
leave it alone.

246
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,667
How are you feeling?

247
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:41,458
Better than Gary.

248
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,041
He's usually the calm one.

249
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,041
I need him to be
the calm one.

250
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,875
Give him some time.

251
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:49,583
I'm not good at that.

252
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,458
Think about what I do--
trading commodities.

253
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,375
It's a frantic business.
It never stops.

254
00:11:55,417 --> 00:11:58,041
I never stopped.

255
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,041
Until Gary made you?

256
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,500
The baby made me.

257
00:12:02,542 --> 00:12:04,500
And Gary, I guess...

258
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:08,041
Well, he made it possible.

259
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,083
He doesn't want to lose you.

260
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:13,041
On our first date, he told me
that he was really okay

261
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,041
being with a woman
who had a career,

262
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:20,041
but that no kids
would be a deal breaker.

263
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,041
I promised him.

264
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:25,083
I can relate.

265
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:28,583
Sometimes, wanting a baby,
it's, uh...

266
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:31,208
Well, it's like
nothing else matters.

267
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,583
But you have to think about
what you two have been through

268
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:37,667
and that you could die.

269
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:40,917
Yeah...
I guess I could.

270
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,834
Val, what's going on here?

271
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,041
I want to give Gary
a baby.

272
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,125
And you've tried,
but i--

273
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,041
is Gary pressuring you?

274
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,041
No, no. It's not that.

275
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,959
It's just...

276
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,041
I did something once,
and, uh...

277
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,542
What?

278
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:07,083
Five and a half years ago,

279
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,375
Gary and I had settled
into being married.

280
00:13:09,417 --> 00:13:11,250
I passed my series 3,

281
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,250
and I was finally
getting a shot

282
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:15,250
to trade with the big boys.

283
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:18,041
I was stressed
and I wasn't eating,

284
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:21,750
so... I wasn't worried when I
missed a couple of periods,

285
00:13:21,792 --> 00:13:23,917
but...

286
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,959
You can't become
one of the guys

287
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,875
and then walk around
with a baby inside you.

288
00:13:31,917 --> 00:13:34,792
You had an abortion.

289
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:39,667
Did you tell Gary?
I couldn't.

290
00:13:39,709 --> 00:13:41,583
Well, you've gotta
tell him now.

291
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:45,041
I mean, that was years ago.
He won't understand.

292
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,041
Maybe not at first, but you'll
help him to understand.

293
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,959
Not a lie like this.
I'm not saying it's gonna
be easy, all right?

294
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,834
But what if you don't tell,
if you continue to hide this?

295
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:56,083
What do you think that'll do
to your relationship? Val?

296
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,959
Val, talk to me.
I need help in here!

297
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,041
Look at me.
Give me your hands. Breathe.

298
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:07,000
Breathe. Good.
Okay, okay, breathe.

299
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,500
Hey.

300
00:14:11,542 --> 00:14:13,000
Um...

301
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:18,333
Are you still in love
with Billy?

302
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,208
What?
Your ex-husband,

303
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,041
do you still have feelings
for him or...

304
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:26,041
He broke my heart, Cooper.
Right.

305
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,834
But you kept his picture until,
you know, this morning. Why?

306
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,583
You really
can't let this go?

307
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:33,041
Honestly, no. You're dragging
your feet on the wedding,

308
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,458
the invitations still haven't
gone out, and every time

309
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,959
I bring it up, you look at me
like I'm the crazy one.

310
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
And now there's this photo.

311
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:42,417
Look... I found it
a few weeks ago

312
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,959
when we started
the invitations.

313
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,250
I don't know why I kept it.
I just did.

314
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:51,041
So does he still
mean something to you?

315
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,709
Is that what you think?

316
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,041
All I know is, we're about
to start this life together,

317
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:58,041
and this feels weird.

318
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:00,041
So what, y-y-you want
to break up with me?

319
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,667
Maybe call off our wedding?

320
00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:03,208
Of course not.

321
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,875
I just want
to understand this.

322
00:15:05,917 --> 00:15:08,417
It's history.

323
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,208
It's done.

324
00:15:13,417 --> 00:15:16,166
I don't understand. What--
I mean, look at her.

325
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:18,792
It's called s.V.C. Syndrome.

326
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,041
It's a blockage of the vessels
that drain the neck and head.

327
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,083
It's causing pressure
and lack of oxygen

328
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,041
to those areas.

329
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:28,041
You could stop breathing.
Is this
because of the cancer?

330
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:31,041
It is. This is why we need
to start treatment immediately.

331
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,959
After the baby's born.

332
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,542
Please, baby.
I can't lose you.

333
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:40,417
I need to come home
and hear about your crazy day

334
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:43,041
with the mouth breathers
at your office.

335
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:47,208
I need to replant our garden
every year and surprise you.

336
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:50,125
You need to be a dad.

337
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:54,041
Not alone. I don't want
to do it alone.

338
00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:59,166
Do something.
Val...

339
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,041
Dr. Montgomery,
don't do this.

340
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:06,000
You two have a deal, right,
the truth no matter what?

341
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,375
I...

342
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,500
I had an abortion.

343
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:33,959
When?

344
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,959
I had just started trading,
and I couldn't.

345
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,583
But I could've.

346
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:48,041
Why would you do that?

347
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:51,417
I would've stayed home.
I would've done everything.

348
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,000
I'm so sorry.

349
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:56,041
Please.
You have to forgive me.

350
00:16:57,208 --> 00:17:00,000
I don't--i don't know
if I can.

351
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:19,750
Am I completely crazy
for doing this?

352
00:17:19,792 --> 00:17:21,750
You really want me
to answer that?

353
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:24,375
You're a little bit crazy,
but I know you,

354
00:17:24,417 --> 00:17:27,041
and I know you're not gonna
be able to let this go,

355
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:30,041
and you think you can
help her, so...
That's why
you're my best friend.

356
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,542
Okay. Okay, I'm gonna be sitting
right here watching you,

357
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:35,041
so if you feel threatened
at all, you give me the sign,

358
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,875
and I'm there.
Bye.

359
00:17:36,917 --> 00:17:38,917
Bye.

360
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:58,208
Katie.

361
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,458
Oh, my god. W--

362
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,458
What--
what are you doing here?

363
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,166
You can't--
We need to talk.
We need to talk.

364
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,917
No, no, no. My restraining
order--i could get in trouble.

365
00:18:08,959 --> 00:18:11,959
Don't worry.
I came to see you.
That's not
how they'll see it.

366
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,041
You have to go, now.
Please. I just need--

367
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,500
Give me a minute.

368
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:25,208
Oh.

369
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,041
Um...

370
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:32,041
Uh...

371
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,875
Despite what you may think,

372
00:18:33,917 --> 00:18:36,125
I always tried to be
a good doctor to you.

373
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,917
I always worked with the goal
of getting you well.

374
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:41,041
I even kept you out of jail

375
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:44,667
so that you could get
the treatment that you needed.
Yes, and I will always
be grateful for that.

376
00:18:44,709 --> 00:18:48,041
Then why are you doing this?
Why are you...

377
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,959
Attacking me again?

378
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,917
I'm not attacking you.

379
00:18:51,959 --> 00:18:54,000
I'm standing up for myself.

380
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,542
I spent 18 months
in an institution,

381
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:02,000
working on my recovery,
dealing with my past

382
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:05,083
and all the mistakes I made,
and it was hard.

383
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:08,083
But I did it because I wanted
a future for myself.

384
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:12,041
And then when I got out,
I-I did all the right things.

385
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:14,000
I got a therapist,
I got this job.

386
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:17,542
I-I even met a guy--
Justin...

387
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:20,834
A really great guy.

388
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:25,000
He had no idea who I was
or what I had done.

389
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:27,125
He just cared about me--

390
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,000
this me.

391
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,333
And then...

392
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:35,375
Justin's sister...

393
00:19:35,417 --> 00:19:37,709
She read your book.

394
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,041
She read your book

395
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,834
and... she put it together.

396
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,333
And she told him,

397
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:47,709
and he was...

398
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,667
He was gone so fast.

399
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:55,041
Do you understand

400
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,417
what...

401
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,417
What your book
is doing to me?

402
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,417
It's--it's taking away
my clean start.

403
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:05,041
I-I changed the name. I tried
to protect your identity.
People read the newspaper,

404
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,792
they watch the news,
they remember what I did.

405
00:20:07,834 --> 00:20:10,792
It's not hard to put together
those stories with the book.
The book is the story
of my life,

406
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,792
of all the things
that happened to me.

407
00:20:12,834 --> 00:20:16,041
And that night, what...

408
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:19,041
What you did to me,
that is part of it.

409
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,041
How can I write about my life

410
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,583
if I don't write
about that night?

411
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:26,625
But that's me anymore.
You know that.

412
00:20:26,667 --> 00:20:28,792
I do know that.

413
00:20:28,834 --> 00:20:30,792
So then that book
is our past, right?

414
00:20:30,834 --> 00:20:32,875
Yours and mine.

415
00:20:32,917 --> 00:20:35,208
I need to be looking forward.

416
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,750
As long as that book
is out there, I can't heal.

417
00:20:55,959 --> 00:20:58,041
Charlotte kept a picture
of her ex-husband

418
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,834
who cheated on her,
and I confronted her about it--

419
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,291
ooh, that's unlike you.

420
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:06,041
She won't tell me why she
kept it, and I'm worried.

421
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:09,208
She's lied to me before
about this guy.

422
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,500
Am I crazy
to make a thing outta this?

423
00:21:12,542 --> 00:21:16,208
Uh, sit down.

424
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,000
Uh...

425
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,291
Has she had any contact
with her ex-husband

426
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:25,417
since the divorce?
As far as I know,

427
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,709
they have not talked since
the day she walked out on him,

428
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,709
but, you know,
they moved here together,

429
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,750
and... I looked him up.
He's still here.

430
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:33,500
He's a mechanic
in north Hollywood.

431
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:36,542
Well, she might
still care about him.

432
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:40,667
You think she still
has feelings for this guy?
Yes, yes, but not necessarily
the way you think.

433
00:21:40,709 --> 00:21:42,458
Okay, I don't understand.

434
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:46,041
Charlotte might be
holding on to that picture

435
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:48,041
not because she still cares
about her ex,

436
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:51,000
but because she still cares
about why he cheated on her.

437
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:53,000
She loved this guy,
and he deceived her.

438
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:56,000
And no matter how much people
tell her it wasn't her fault,

439
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:58,041
somewhere deep down,
Charlotte probably wonders,

440
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,041
if on some level
it was her fault,

441
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,458
if she did something
to push the guy away or...

442
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,917
So how does she
get past it?

443
00:22:04,959 --> 00:22:07,166
Well, either she confronts him
and tries to understand--

444
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:10,166
that's never gonna happen.
Or she lives with it.

445
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:12,291
People live with all kinds
of frustrations, Cooper.

446
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:14,709
You know, believe me.

447
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,333
Uh, if this is
a violet/marla thing--

448
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:20,041
Violet plays it down,
acts like it's nothing.

449
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:22,583
But it's not nothing, Cooper.
It's something to me.

450
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:25,375
And to spitefully suggest
that a woman like Marla

451
00:22:25,417 --> 00:22:27,834
can be swapped out
for a friend of Charlotte's--

452
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:32,208
I mean, no offense--
when I'm in love...

453
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,959
You're in love with Marla?

454
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,875
Maybe, but the point is,
I'll never know.

455
00:22:38,917 --> 00:22:41,041
This whole "living
with frustration" thing,

456
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:43,333
maybe it's not
such a good idea.

457
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:45,208
Yeah.

458
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,041
Excuse me.

459
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:58,041
Do you know where I could find,
uh, Billy Douglas?

460
00:22:58,083 --> 00:22:59,750
Right over there.

461
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:03,041
Tall guy.
Uh, name tag says "Billy."

462
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:10,041
Hey, uh, Billy Douglas?

463
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:12,417
What can I do for you?

464
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:15,041
Uh, I'm Cooper Freedman,
and this may sound strange,

465
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:17,041
but I'm engaged
to Charlotte king.

466
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:20,792
And I need to talk to you.

467
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,458
Why did you push her?

468
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,041
I didn't push her.

469
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:31,250
Yes, Addison, you did.

470
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:34,709
She was a wreck. The secret
was eating away at her.

471
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:37,834
She was willing to risk her life
to make it right with Gary.

472
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,291
I thought
he'd at least listen.
Well, he did listen.

473
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:43,250
Yeah, right before
he walked out the door.
Val lied to him.

474
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:46,291
Val made a choice.
A unilateral choice. She didn't
discuss it with her husband.

475
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:48,291
She didn't even tell him
what she was doing.

476
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:50,291
She just--she just did it

477
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:52,750
and expected him to say
it was okay.

478
00:23:52,792 --> 00:23:55,750
But when--when you're in love
with someone, Addison,

479
00:23:55,792 --> 00:23:57,875
when you're
in a real relationship,

480
00:23:57,917 --> 00:23:59,959
you don't do that.

481
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,250
Our relationship is real.

482
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:05,041
Sam, I love you.
Then why did you give me
an ultimatum?

483
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:07,041
We discussed it.
We did not discuss.

484
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:09,834
You said, either we have
a baby or we end it.

485
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:12,333
That's not a discussion.

486
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:19,041
I can't date Marla
if Violet hates her.

487
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,542
Why not?

488
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:22,542
It'll create work stress
and personal stress,

489
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:24,542
and people will be,
well, unhappy.

490
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:27,375
Violet will be unhappy,
just like you are now.

491
00:24:27,417 --> 00:24:30,542
Yeah, well--
yeah, well, what? How much
do you like this woman?

492
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:33,542
Well, given the short amount
of time I've spent with her,

493
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:36,083
it's a lot.
And how much do you think

494
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:38,542
Violet cares about
Marla's review of her book?

495
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:41,709
Honestly? A lot.
How much should she care?

496
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,709
Not much.
Well, then tell Violet.

497
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:48,041
The problem is not
gonna fix itself, Sheldon.

498
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:51,166
If it's bothering you
this much...

499
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:54,959
♪♪♪

500
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,291
Ha. Spying on
the boy next door?

501
00:24:58,333 --> 00:25:02,500
No. I--no. I was, uh--
spying on the boy next door.

502
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:05,041
I get it... if you and Sam
were in the sixth grade.

503
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:07,208
Why don't you
just go talk to him?

504
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:10,166
And say what, sorry I forced you
to choose between having a baby

505
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:12,083
you may not want to have

506
00:25:12,125 --> 00:25:15,041
or losing me,
but, you know, tick tock, Sam?

507
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:17,041
Well, are you really sorry,

508
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:19,375
I love Sam.
I want things to work out.

509
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:21,500
Well, as much as you want
a baby?

510
00:25:21,542 --> 00:25:24,333
I don't want
to have to choose.

511
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:27,542
So that's why
you're making him do it.

Oh.

518
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:44,417
Violet, again? Why are you
doing this to yourself?

519
00:25:44,458 --> 00:25:47,417
Well, I may have to accept
some culpability in all this.

520
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:51,041
I don't know, maybe I-I should
pull the books from the shelf.

521
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:53,041
Look, the book
helped you heal.

522
00:25:53,083 --> 00:25:55,041
And who knows how many
other people it will help?

Maybe not everybody,

524
00:25:57,166 --> 00:26:01,000
but taking it off the shelf
is not the answer.
According to Katie,
it didn't help her heal.

525
00:26:01,041 --> 00:26:03,375
I'm sorry.

526
00:26:03,417 --> 00:26:06,208
I-I know you didn't
want me to go see her.
You're doing it again,

527
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:08,625
exactly what you did
during Katie's trial--

528
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:11,166
look where that got us.
Well, I had to try something.

529
00:26:11,208 --> 00:26:13,583
So irresponsible of you to put
yourself in jeopardy like that.

530
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:17,375
Do you remember that I found you
bleeding on the floor?

531
00:26:17,417 --> 00:26:21,041
You have me to think about.
You have Lucas to think about.
Katie was fine.
She was better than fine.

532
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:23,375
She has her life together.
She was--she was doing well.

533
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:26,041
How can you still
have sympathy for her?
Because she's my patient.

534
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:28,417
Because she will always be
my patient.

535
00:26:28,458 --> 00:26:31,625
And turning my back on her now
makes me a hypocrite.
She is not your patient!

536
00:26:31,667 --> 00:26:34,041
She stopped being your patient

537
00:26:34,083 --> 00:26:37,291
when she cut out our son
and left you to die.

538
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:39,041
You can't fix her.

539
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:44,041
No matter how hard you try,
you cannot fix everyone, Violet.

540
00:26:44,083 --> 00:26:47,208
The sooner you accept that,
the better off we'll all be.

Yeah.
Oh, that's too bad,

544
00:26:57,792 --> 00:27:01,000
because there's someone here
that wants to speak with you.

545
00:27:03,458 --> 00:27:05,792
Hey, Charlie.

546
00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:14,000
Hey.

547
00:27:16,041 --> 00:27:18,041
You been here all night?

548
00:27:18,083 --> 00:27:20,500
I don't know
what to say to her,

but...

550
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:25,333
I couldn't leave her
either.

551
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:28,250
You know, val told me
that you wouldn't forgive her,

552
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:30,917
and I thought...

553
00:27:30,959 --> 00:27:32,083
I don't know.

554
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:36,000
People come to us all the time,
wanting to have a baby

555
00:27:36,041 --> 00:27:39,041
because they think it'll fix
what's wrong in their marriage

556
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:41,041
or fill the void
in their lives,

557
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:43,041
but... with you guys,
the love is there.

558
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:46,834
I mean,
it's always been there, right?

559
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:48,917
Val made a mistake.

560
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:51,375
She works
with a bunch of jerks.

561
00:27:52,875 --> 00:27:54,834
And every day she comes home,
and I cook dinner,

562
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:56,792
and she tells me
what they've done,

563
00:27:56,834 --> 00:27:58,792
and I give her perspective.

564
00:27:58,834 --> 00:28:00,875
Usually I say...

565
00:28:00,917 --> 00:28:04,041
"It's not cancer"

566
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:07,000
or "at least
you're not married to them."

567
00:28:07,041 --> 00:28:10,166
And she laughs.

568
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:13,625
And she relaxes.

569
00:28:13,667 --> 00:28:15,125
It's hard to explain,

570
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:18,375
but when val and I
are together...

571
00:28:20,041 --> 00:28:22,583
We just fit.

572
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:25,458
And I used to think
that meant...

573
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,667
That we could
overcome anything.

574
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,583
Now...

575
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:34,542
I don't know.

576
00:28:34,583 --> 00:28:38,041
Gary, val is willing
to give up her life

577
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:41,750
to make things right
with you.

578
00:28:41,792 --> 00:28:44,792
What are you willing to do?

579
00:28:49,083 --> 00:28:51,709
You should know

580
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:54,834
that even though it was hard
for me to stop seeing Marla,

581
00:28:54,875 --> 00:28:56,792
I did it because of
my friendship with you.

582
00:28:56,834 --> 00:28:58,792
And I realize now that if
we were really friends,

583
00:28:58,834 --> 00:29:00,667
you never would've asked me

584
00:29:00,709 --> 00:29:03,041
to stop seeing her
in the first place.
Mm-hmm.

585
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:05,041
You would've set aside
your grievance--

586
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:06,834
even though I understand it--

587
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:10,083
when weighed against my personal
happiness, would seem petty.

588
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:13,041
I'm the one that got hurt here,
not you.

589
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:16,875
And I think it's high time
that you recognize it.

590
00:29:16,917 --> 00:29:18,917
You finished?
Yes.

591
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:21,041
Okay. Well,
here's how I see it--

592
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:23,041
if you were
a really good friend,

593
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:25,458
you wouldn't make this
an issue right now.

594
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,291
Out of all the women
in the world,

595
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:29,291
you wouldn't have chosen
the one--

596
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:31,291
the only one, I might add--

597
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:33,291
who essentially
assassinated me in print.

598
00:29:33,333 --> 00:29:34,750
You would've said,

599
00:29:34,792 --> 00:29:37,542
"Marla thompkins, dead to me,"
and that would've been it,

600
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:39,542
because that's what
good friends do.

601
00:29:39,583 --> 00:29:42,041
Then I guess the only thing
we can agree on

602
00:29:42,083 --> 00:29:44,125
is that
we shouldn't be friends.

603
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,709
Your boyfriend's brave.

604
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:58,166
He's my fiancé.

605
00:29:58,208 --> 00:30:00,709
And, yeah, he is.

606
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,875
But believe me when I say,

607
00:30:02,917 --> 00:30:05,875
I did not ask him
to do this.

608
00:30:05,917 --> 00:30:07,750
I know...

609
00:30:07,792 --> 00:30:10,041
We kinda just left things--

610
00:30:10,083 --> 00:30:12,709
you cheated on me, Billy,

611
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:15,875
six months into something
that was supposed to be forever.

612
00:30:15,917 --> 00:30:19,166
Shame on me for not realizing
that "working late"

613
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:22,083
meant working on some girl
called Trixie.

614
00:30:22,125 --> 00:30:25,083
Tiffany.
Her name was Tiffany.
I don't give a damn
what her name was.

615
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:27,542
She wasn't your wife.

616
00:30:27,583 --> 00:30:30,542
I know this isn't gonna
make you feel any better,

617
00:30:30,583 --> 00:30:36,041
but I didn't sleep with her
because I didn't love you.

618
00:30:36,083 --> 00:30:38,041
You're right.

619
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:40,083
That doesn't make me
feel better.

620
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:42,542
Look...

621
00:30:44,583 --> 00:30:47,583
When we first moved out here,

622
00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:50,583
I didn't have a very good sense
of who I was.

623
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:53,375
But now I do.

624
00:30:53,417 --> 00:30:55,125
Good for you.

625
00:30:55,166 --> 00:30:58,041
I'm gay, Charlotte.

626
00:30:58,083 --> 00:30:59,959
Get out.

627
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,041
You're mad that I'm gay?

628
00:31:03,083 --> 00:31:05,959
I'm mad that you're
a liar and a cheat.

629
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,959
Turn around,
walk your ass outta my office,

630
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,417
and don't you ever
come back.

631
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:28,041
You should not have
brought him here!
Before you say anything,
I was trying to help you.

632
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:30,458
I don't need
that kind of help.
Yeah, you do.

633
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,041
He hurt you, Charlotte,
and you never knew why,

634
00:31:33,083 --> 00:31:35,625
and that created anxiety.
You felt it. I felt it.

635
00:31:35,667 --> 00:31:37,166
And now you know.

636
00:31:37,208 --> 00:31:40,041
You know it was nothing
you did to push him away.

637
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:42,667
There's nothing wrong with you.
This is good, Charlotte.

638
00:31:42,709 --> 00:31:45,041
This is closure.

639
00:31:45,083 --> 00:31:48,125
I wish it were
that easy, Cooper.

640
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:56,041
We're doing the c-section?

641
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:59,000
Yes.

642
00:31:59,041 --> 00:32:02,041
So you convinced val?

643
00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:03,792
I didn't.

644
00:32:03,834 --> 00:32:06,458
What did you say
to talk him into it?

645
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,041
I told him that unless
he wanted to risk losing her,

646
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:11,041
he had to say something.

647
00:32:11,083 --> 00:32:13,041
What if he said no?

648
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:15,041
He wasn't going to.

649
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:17,250
He loves her.

650
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,875
Did you take her?

651
00:32:30,458 --> 00:32:33,041
I do not want her
anywhere near that woman.
It's Violet's decision.

652
00:32:33,083 --> 00:32:36,041
You put her in danger!
We both know that she was
gonna go no matter what, okay?

653
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:39,333
We both know that.
At least I was with her.

654
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:43,083
We're on--
we're on the same side here.

655
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:45,083
Okay? The last thing
Violet needs right now

656
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:47,291
is the two of us fighting.

657
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:50,291
The truth is,
I'm angrier at her than you.

658
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:53,291
She does what she wants
when she wants.

659
00:32:53,333 --> 00:32:56,834
Hey,
that's what makes her Violet.

660
00:33:01,083 --> 00:33:02,083
Hey.

661
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:04,041
What happened with cancer mom
and her preemie?

662
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:06,041
Uh, Addison did the c-section.
Mom's okay.

663
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:07,750
And baby?

664
00:33:07,792 --> 00:33:09,291
Uh, we'll see.

665
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:12,291
You know, no matter what is
happening with you and Addison,

666
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:15,333
it doesn't have to be awkward
between you and me.

667
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:17,083
Oh, yeah, well, uh,

668
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:20,291
I-I just got
a lot on my mind.

669
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:23,083
More than just Addison?
Amelia, please.

670
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:26,291
Sorry. Forget I asked.

671
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:28,834
She gave the ultimatum,
you know,

672
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:30,291
not me.

673
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:33,166
I know that.

674
00:33:33,208 --> 00:33:36,291
The fact that we are whatever
we are right now is on her.

675
00:33:36,333 --> 00:33:38,834
Until you answer.

676
00:33:38,875 --> 00:33:42,041
She didn't have to do it
like this.

677
00:33:42,083 --> 00:33:44,041
Maybe not,
but she knows what she wants.

678
00:33:44,083 --> 00:33:46,000
I mean, do you?

679
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:48,041
Not yet.

680
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:50,375
Do you think
maybe that's your answer?

681
00:34:01,667 --> 00:34:03,542
Mr. Douglas.

682
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:07,583
You've always had a temper.

683
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:10,250
Yeah, well...

684
00:34:12,208 --> 00:34:15,041
It wasn't my idea
to come see ya.

685
00:34:15,083 --> 00:34:17,041
But your guy Cooper...

686
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:19,375
Can be very persistent.

687
00:34:19,417 --> 00:34:21,667
I know that.

688
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:28,041
Why didn't you just
tell me you were gay?

689
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:34,000
I was confused.

690
00:34:34,041 --> 00:34:36,083
I thought that...

691
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:41,792
I wondered if the problem
was you.

692
00:34:41,834 --> 00:34:44,041
That's what Tiffany
was about,

693
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:46,041
trying to see
if I felt different

694
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:48,250
with another woman.

695
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:51,041
I didn't.

696
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:54,333
You realize,
that doesn't make it okay.

697
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:58,041
The fact that you never
told me...

698
00:34:58,083 --> 00:35:01,041
Yeah.

699
00:35:04,875 --> 00:35:07,333
I didn't mean to hurt you.

700
00:35:07,375 --> 00:35:10,041
I-I know that sounds stupid,

701
00:35:10,083 --> 00:35:12,542
but it was nothing you did.

702
00:35:12,583 --> 00:35:14,250
You...

703
00:35:14,291 --> 00:35:18,041
Are an amazing woman.

704
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:21,000
Was I kidding myself
to think you'd feel relieved?

705
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:26,041
It's just, uh...

706
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:29,709
Back then...

707
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:32,375
You were the right choice...

708
00:35:32,417 --> 00:35:34,375
The perfect guy.

709
00:35:34,417 --> 00:35:38,667
My parents loved you,
my friends loved you...

710
00:35:38,709 --> 00:35:41,125
I loved you.

711
00:35:42,792 --> 00:35:45,709
And now knowing...
That I fell in love

712
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:48,875
with a man
who could never love me back...

713
00:35:48,917 --> 00:35:51,041
Not the way I needed--

714
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:53,166
I never thought of myself

715
00:35:53,208 --> 00:35:55,792
as a woman
who makes bad choices.

716
00:35:58,083 --> 00:36:01,041
Is that what this is about?

717
00:36:01,083 --> 00:36:02,834
You feel like an idiot?

718
00:36:04,083 --> 00:36:08,041
You couldn't have known.
Hell, I didn't know.

719
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:11,125
But this time...

720
00:36:11,166 --> 00:36:14,000
Don't you think
you got it right?

721
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:30,750
I'm risking everything
coming here.

722
00:36:30,792 --> 00:36:32,417
Oh!

723
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:34,125
Katie, what are you...

724
00:36:38,083 --> 00:36:41,375
I know you didn't write
the book to hurt me.

725
00:36:41,417 --> 00:36:44,458
You needed to heal, too,
and--
Katie, you shouldn't
be here.

726
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:48,250
Oh, but it's okay for you
to come to my work?

727
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,542
What I did to you...

728
00:36:52,583 --> 00:36:56,041
It was wrong, and I know
I can never make it right.

729
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:58,667
It's with me all the time.

730
00:36:58,709 --> 00:37:01,417
It's--it's like...

731
00:37:01,458 --> 00:37:05,041
It's like this wound
that never heals,

732
00:37:05,083 --> 00:37:07,458
no matter how hard I try.

733
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,834
I relive it in my sleep.

734
00:37:09,875 --> 00:37:12,375
I agonize
over it when I'm away.

735
00:37:12,417 --> 00:37:15,458
- I forgive you.
- That's just it.

736
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:19,041
I can never forgive myself.

737
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:21,625
Well, it--it'll...

738
00:37:21,667 --> 00:37:24,500

I'm sorry.

Hey.

I let my own insecurities get
in the way of your happiness,

746
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:06,291
and that was wrong.
I mean, it's my problem,

747
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:10,500
and I-I shouldn't have
taken it out on you, so i'm...

and--and figure this out
as we go?

808
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,458
No, my mother killed herself,
Sam.

809
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,458
No, she spent her entire life
never being who she really was,

810
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,250
never saying out loud,

811
00:40:49,291 --> 00:40:52,041
"this is who I am,
and this is what I want,"

812
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:55,041
and then when she finally did
get the courage up to go for it,

813
00:40:55,083 --> 00:40:57,041
it was too late.

814
00:40:57,083 --> 00:40:59,041
She waited too long.

815
00:40:59,083 --> 00:41:00,583
Sam...

816
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:03,750
I... have already waited
too long.

817
00:41:03,792 --> 00:41:07,041
You know, first it was "wait
until you meet the right guy,"

818
00:41:07,083 --> 00:41:09,041
and then I met Derek,
and then I told myself,

819
00:41:09,083 --> 00:41:11,583
"Addison, be smart. Wait until
you finish med school,"

820
00:41:11,625 --> 00:41:13,583
then "wait until you finish
your residency,"

821
00:41:13,625 --> 00:41:15,542
and then "wait until you finish
your fellowship,"

822
00:41:15,583 --> 00:41:18,041
and my marriage exploded,
and then I had an affair,

823
00:41:18,083 --> 00:41:20,041
and then it was,
"oh, no, not now.

824
00:41:20,083 --> 00:41:23,250
You can't have Mark's baby.
That would be unseemly."

825
00:41:23,291 --> 00:41:25,709
And I waited and waited
and waited

826
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,667
until I only had
one egg left.

827
00:41:27,709 --> 00:41:30,333
I mean, it's not
that I didn't want kids.

828
00:41:30,375 --> 00:41:32,333
It's because I took
having kids for granted,

829
00:41:32,375 --> 00:41:34,375

can do it,

830

can do it.
