00:00:22,834 --> 00:00:25,333
Curtain three.
Dr. Wilder is on call.

4
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:27,041
Got it.

5
00:00:28,792 --> 00:00:30,750
What's happening?
Is the baby okay?

6
00:00:30,792 --> 00:00:33,542
That's why I paged
Dr. Montgomery.

7
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,458
This is Elana stone.
She's 33 years old, 22 weeks.

8
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,041
Presented with diffuse pain

9
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:40,667
localized more
in the abdominal area.
I think
I'm having a miscarriage.

10
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:42,458
Okay, Elana,

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,041
I'm gonna do an ultrasound, try
to figure out what's going on.

12
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:47,458
She's had chronic pain
for the last five years,

13
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,333
sensitivity to touch,
migraines.
Seven doctors,
no one could find anything.

14
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:53,041
Ow!
Elana, I need you to hang in
a little longer, okay?

15
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:55,792
Okay.
Okay.

16
00:00:55,834 --> 00:00:57,041
Ow!

17
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:58,250
Ow!

18
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:00,375
Is our baby okay?

19
00:01:00,417 --> 00:01:02,083
He looks just fine.

20
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:04,041
But the pain...

21
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:06,625
Lately even breathing's
been hard.

22
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:08,667
Well, it's possible
that the pregnancy...

23
00:01:08,709 --> 00:01:11,291
Ow!
Is exacerbating the underlying
condition. I'm sorry.

24
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:15,041
Please.
You have to help me.

25
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:20,583
A cluster of
unrelated symptoms

26
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:22,583
including severe pain
with no obvious cause?

27
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:24,041
You think it's fibromyalgia?

28
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:26,792
I've had patients with it
before, and it's maddening.

29
00:01:26,834 --> 00:01:28,834
You can't give them
a definitive diagnosis,

30
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:31,333
treatment's complicated.
Yeah, we can't give her
anything too strong

31
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:34,834
over the long term.
It'll hurt the baby.
Alternative treatments
can work.

32
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:37,667
That'd be great if we had time,
but she needs help right now.

33
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:41,041
Well, if we can't give her meds
and alternatives are too slow,

34
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:43,875
then what do you suggest?

35
00:01:46,792 --> 00:01:49,750
Yeah. Thank you.

36
00:01:49,792 --> 00:01:52,208
Betsey. Hi.

37
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,542
Hi. It's so good
to see you.

38
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:57,542
I'm Monica Bratton,
Betsey's aunt.

39
00:01:57,583 --> 00:01:59,333
Hi. I-I'm Violet Turner.

40
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:02,125
I'm so sorry for your loss.
We all are.

41
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:04,959
You know, Dell was...
He--he was family.

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,041
I spoke to a Dr. Freedman
on the phone

43
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:09,166
when Betsey first came
to live with me.

44
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:11,166
He said if we ever needed
anything, to be in touch.

45
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:13,959
Yes. Uh, he--well, he's with
a patient right now.

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,709
Would--would you like--
I suppose
I could just tell you.

47
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,542
Look, I don't have kids. It's
a choice I made a long time ago.

48
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:21,583
Uh, yes. I-I understand.
It can be a big adjustment,

49
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:24,667
but sometimes--
and when Dell died
and I took Betsey in,

50
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:27,250
I did it because it was
the right thing to do.

51
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:29,417
But I can't keep her.

52
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,625
Is it wrong that I want
to punch aunt Monica?

53
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:52,750
On several levels,
but so do I.

54
00:02:52,792 --> 00:02:55,125
Look, despite what is clearly
a limited emotional capacity,

55
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:58,959
I think aunt Monica did what
she thought was best for Betsey.

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,583
Come on. She left her in
our office like Paddington bear.

57
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:04,041
The only thing missing was
a note pinned to her jacket.

58
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:07,041
She brought her back to the only
family that she has left.

59
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:09,959
But we're not her family.
She needs Naomi.

60
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,041
Well, Nai was the only one
who really bonded with Betsey.

61
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:14,667
Dell and Betsey
lived with her.
Well, she's away

62
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:16,792
on foundation business
for the next month, so...

63
00:03:16,834 --> 00:03:19,583
Maybe we could take her home
for a couple nights?

64
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,458
She's not a puppy, Cooper.

65
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,458
The department of children
and family services

66
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,041
is set up
for situations like this.

67
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:29,458
You know, I-I have a friend--
we're not placing Betsey
in the system.

68
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,417
Everybody in her life
has abandoned her.
They died, Violet.

69
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:35,041
I understand that, Charlotte,
but in her mind, they--
the system is there to protect
kids exactly like Betsey.

70
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,792
And more often than not,
it still screws them up.

71
00:03:37,834 --> 00:03:40,458
Either way, Betsey's gonna
have some serious problems.

72
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,834
Her mother was an addict.
Both her parents are dead.

73
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,458
Betsey needs--

74
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,291
help. She needs help, which Dell
would've given any one of us

75
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,709
without a second thought...

76
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,625
If he were still alive.

77
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,250
What's going on?

78
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,875
It's worse. I can't...

79
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:05,583
You have to give me some drugs,
a shot, something.

80
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,709
Unfortunately, anything
strong enough to help you

81
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,875
would wind up
harming the baby.

82
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:12,041
So what,
she just has to suffer?

83
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:13,709
If the pregnancy's
making this worse,

84
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,750
can't you just
take the baby out?
No, the baby's not viable yet.

85
00:04:15,792 --> 00:04:18,125
But there are
alternative treatments

86
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,333
that could help
for the remainder of your term.

87
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:23,041
I would be with you
every step of the way,

88
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:26,041
and once you deliver,
the level of pain might subside.

89
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:29,041
That's another
three and a half months. No.

90
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,917
If you can't
take away the pain,

91
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:35,542
I can't have this baby.

92
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,000
She can't abort our baby.

93
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,083
Elana's in agony.

94
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,542
If she doesn't feel
she can carry to term--

95
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,542
she didn't want a kid.

96
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,542
I pushed her,
and finally she agreed,

97
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:55,542
but I've never...
I've never felt my son kick.

98
00:04:55,583 --> 00:05:00,709
Elana won't let me touch her
because of the pain, but...

99
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,041
That's my baby.

100
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:07,917
And I won't let you kill him.

101
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:16,125
I'm not crapping in a cup.

102
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:17,583
It's the only way

103
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,583
to find out what's wrong
with your stomach.

104
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,500
I'm not doing it.

105
00:05:21,542 --> 00:05:24,166
Okay.
How about the truth then?

106
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,834
Come on. Everybody knows
that a stomachache

107
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,834
is the best way
to get out of school.

108
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:31,125
You can't prove it.
You can't disprove it.

109
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:34,166
Why are you faking?
But I'm not faking--

110
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,625
ah, th--it's the truth
or the cup.

111
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:38,542
Your choice.

112
00:05:41,667 --> 00:05:44,166
All right.
There's these kids at school.

113
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:47,166
And they don't really like
the stuff that I'm into,

114
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,166
so they do things to me.
Like?

115
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:52,041
Like I had pictures
in my locker,

116
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,959
and then they tore them down.
I'm assuming they weren't
pictures of girls.

117
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,250
Anime.

118
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,417
You know, they're--

119
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,333
cartoons, yeah.
People with big eyes

120
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:01,917
and impossible-to-pronounce
names.

121
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:05,667
Well, they're Japanese fantasy
and action animations, but...

122
00:06:05,709 --> 00:06:08,041
Yeah.
Yeah.

123
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,208
Anyway, so I was trying
to get my pictures back,

124
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,750
and then the asshats
dragged me out to the quad

125
00:06:12,792 --> 00:06:16,041
and duct taped me
to a flagpole.
Oh, that's, uh, not good.

126
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:21,041
Yeah. It was my dad that
got me into all this stuff.

127
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,542
If he hadn't died,

128
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,458
he'd probably
help me kick their asses.

129
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,583
Yeah.

130
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:30,667
Look, can't you just
write me a note?

131
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:32,667
Then what, homeschooling,
witness protection?

132
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:34,667
I mean, you know,
teenagers can be jerks,

133
00:06:34,709 --> 00:06:37,083
but you can't hide forever.

134
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,875
So find the other kids
that are into anime

135
00:06:39,917 --> 00:06:43,291
and, you know,
you're gonna be fine.
Yeah, I'm trying. But what
am I supposed to do right now?

136
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:46,208
Well, what would the hero
from one of your stories do?

137
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,291
Oh, please don't tell her.

138
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,291
She's just
gonna make it worse.

139
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:53,041
Does he need a cuddle
or a kick in the backside?

140
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,500
Um...

141
00:06:55,542 --> 00:06:58,041
Well, a bug's been doing around,
but I think he's on the mend.

142
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,041
Um, just to be
on the safe side,

143
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:03,041
I'd keep him home
for the rest of the day,

144
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,041
make sure
it's out of his system.
Okay. Sound good to you?

145
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:06,917
Yeah.

146
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,834
She's in unbearable pain,

147
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,875
and it's gotten worse
with the pregnancy.
But do you think
it's bad enough that

148
00:07:11,917 --> 00:07:14,667
she should terminate a pregnancy
that's almost viable?
That is a decision
for Elana.

149
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:17,250
But there are treatments
she hasn't tried yet

150
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:19,041
that alter the release
of neurotransmitters

151
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,667
and increase
her pain tolerance.

152
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:22,667
Pete, I am not eager
to terminate her pregnancy,

153
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:25,125
but I'm also not gonna
look her in the eye

154
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:28,625
and tell her
she needs to be tougher.
Is she
having trouble breathing?

155
00:07:28,667 --> 00:07:30,208
Yeah, she mentioned that.
Swallowing?

156
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,750
Yeah, it's in her chart.

157
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:36,041
Order an m.R.I.

158
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:38,792
Yep, I'm brilliant.
Get used to it.

159
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:41,083
And get me that brain scan.

160
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:53,458
Hey, I was looking for you.

161
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,041
Feel like getting a snack?

162
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:59,166
This is my daddy's office.

163
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,583
He used to have crayons

164
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,542
and paper.

165
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,500
Yeah.

166
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:09,583
I remember. You two had
a lot of fun in here.

167
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,750
You know,
he loved you so much.

168
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:14,709
And I know that when
someone you love goes away,

169
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,208
it feels icky.

170
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,500
And it's confusing because you
have all these big feelings

171
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:21,375
that you don't understand.

172
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,750
But I want you to know
that...

173
00:08:26,792 --> 00:08:30,041
All of us here
care about you...

174
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,583
So much...

175
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:36,583
And that
you can tell anything to me.

176
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,041
Okay?

177
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:40,000
Anything at all.

178
00:08:42,792 --> 00:08:45,583
Where am I
gonna sleep tonight?

179
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:56,000
How about
you come home with me?

180
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:01,500
♪♪♪

181
00:09:05,667 --> 00:09:07,333
Should we have offered--

182
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:10,458
mnh-mnh-mnh-mnh-mnh.
Don't--don't even say it.

183
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,250
Oh, come on, Sam.

184
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:15,500
Addison...

185
00:09:15,542 --> 00:09:19,917
Betsey needs
more than we can give her.

186
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,667
And it's not our place.

187
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:24,083
Really, it's--it's not
Violet's place either.

188
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:26,041
Yeah, but it's only
for a few nights.

189
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,041
I mean, I took care of Lucas
for months.

190
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:30,041
I know,
but Lucas was a baby,

191
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,041
and--and all due respect,

192
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:35,000
I mean, you were warm hands
to hold him.

193
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:40,000
Oh.

194
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:43,000
Wait. I didn't mean for it
to come out like that.

195
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:46,458
I-I'm just trying
to say that...

196
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,750
For you,
when you had to let go,

197
00:09:49,792 --> 00:09:51,834
how'd it feel?

198
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:55,417
She's old enough to understand
and get attached.

199
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,500
And it would be brutal.

200
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,250
Why isn't Lucas crying yet?

201
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,250
Because he understands
that I worked a long shift

202
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,041
at the E.R. last night,

203
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,959
and there's another kid
in the house.

204
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,208
And he's thoughtful...

205
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,333
Just like his daddy.

206
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,375
Good morning, boo-boo.

207
00:10:22,417 --> 00:10:25,959
Rise and shine.

208
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,041
Good morning.

209
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,834
Pete!

210
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:38,333
Pete,
Lucas is not in his crib!

211
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:51,041
My daddy and I used to
watch cartoons together.

212
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,291
I thought maybe Lucas
would like them.

213
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:06,041
Try to relax, Elana.
We're almost done.

214
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,583
The sedative is helping.

215
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,583
Too bad we can't
keep her doped up.

216
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:13,041
Well, there's always herbal tea
and Chinese gongs.

217
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:16,917
Okay.
That's a little harsh.

218
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,291
Come on, Addison.
We're surgeons.

219
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:21,041
You're not saying that you
really buy into his whole

220
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,041
bad-juju-caused-my-cancer rap,
do you?

221
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,625
Pete helps a lot of people.
Mm.

222
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:27,625
And just because
you disagree with him

223
00:11:27,667 --> 00:11:29,208
doesn't mean he's wrong.

224
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,625
Well, he's wrong this time.

225
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:35,041
Elana doesn't have fibromyalgia.
She's got a chiari malformation.

226
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:37,041
The herniation's putting
pressure on her brain.

227
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:40,041
You think that's
what's causing her pain?
I do.

228
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:42,041
What can we do about it?

229
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,250
What I do best...

230
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,583
Cut.

231
00:11:50,792 --> 00:11:52,208
Hey.

232
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,208
How was your first night
with Betsey?

233
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,583
Good. In fact,
when I woke up this morning,

234
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:59,041
she was watching cartoons
with Lucas.

235
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:01,000
That sounds fun.

236
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:02,792
It was sweet, actually.

237
00:12:02,834 --> 00:12:05,792
Yeah, she, uh,
she took Lucas from his crib

238
00:12:05,834 --> 00:12:07,458
while I was sleeping.

239
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,500
That sounds...

240
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:11,375
Uh, unnerving.

241
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:13,583
No. I mean,
w--it was for a minute,

242
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,709
but I know
she'd never hurt Lucas.

243
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,250
Yeah, well, we hope, you know,
but Betsey is troubled.

244
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,917
She needs help. She needs
someone to care. That's all.

245
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,458
What I mean is,
you need to be cautious.

246
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,583
I think you're blowing this
out of proportion, Sheldon.

247
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,583
She's a child.

248
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:30,083
Betsey does need help, okay?
Years of help.

249
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,458
And those aren't
going to be easy years.

250
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,458
Now come on.
You know that, right?

251
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,500
Well, I think we owe it to her
and to Dell

252
00:12:37,542 --> 00:12:39,458
to do whatever we can
for her.

253
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,458
But the best thing
you can do for her

254
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,709
is to help her start a new life
as soon as possible.
Meaning without me?

255
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:48,250
I think you'd help Betsey most
by letting her go.

256
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:51,041
So you want
to do brain surgery

257
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,041
on a woman who's almost
six months pregnant?

258
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,041
Yeah, if I release
the intracranial pressure,

259
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,041
it should reduce her pain.
If we don't help her now,

260
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,291
she's gonna terminate
the pregnancy.
I can help her.

261
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,417
Not fast enough, Pete.
You think surgery
is the better option?

262
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,709
Apart from the fact that it
might not help Elana,

263
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,834
it could also kill her.
It could kill her baby.

264
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,834
This is not
a complicated procedure,

265
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,917
and there is a huge upside.
For chiari malformations,

266
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:12,125
inversion therapy
has the same upside.

267
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,333
It can relieve the pressure
on the cerebellar tonsils

268
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,959
and diminish her pain
for weeks.
You're gonna keep
her upside down

269
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,166
for the rest of her life?
I can get her through
the pregnancy.

270
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:22,875
Then you can cut
as much as you want.
All right, look, either way,
Elana and Steven

271
00:13:22,917 --> 00:13:24,542
are gonna need
some guidance here.

272
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:28,375
Fine. He makes his pitch,
I make mine.

273
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:35,583
I'm horny.
Want a quickie?

274
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,583
Well, Emily post
would be proud.

275
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,125
Mm.

276
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,875
Mm. Hey, do you think
we should, um--

277
00:13:41,917 --> 00:13:45,125
less talk. More hands. Mm.

278
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:47,166
Do you think we should
do something?

279
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:49,166
I'm trying to do something.

280
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:51,208
I mean about Betsey.

281
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,417
I mean, you know
if it was our kid,

282
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,959
Dell would step up.

283
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,792
We don't have kids,
Cooper.

284
00:13:56,834 --> 00:13:59,625
Okay, if we did...

285
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:01,166
It's just, she's here,

286
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:05,208
and every time I look at her,
I think that...

287
00:14:06,542 --> 00:14:08,792
Yeah, you hate me
right now, don't you?

288
00:14:08,834 --> 00:14:10,333
A thousand things about you

289
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:14,291
that make me
want to pull my hair out...

290
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:17,959
But you caring too much
is not one of them.

291
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,667
I'm not gettin' laid, am I?

292
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,583
When you're feelin' Randy,

293
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,625
you know where to find me.

294
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:37,208
They called me to come get
my son because he brought

295
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,250
a knife to school!
A knife, Dr. Freedman!

296
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:42,417
He says he's being bullied,
and that's your sage advice?
I never said--

297
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,625
how could you not tell me
what was happening?

298
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:46,792
He's only 14.
Mom, please.

299
00:14:46,834 --> 00:14:49,250
No--
Jackie, Jackie, let's sit down
and we can talk--

300
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:51,291
and--and do what? What are you
gonna tell him next?

301
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:54,458
I'm trying to help.
Really? You could've
gotten him killed.

302
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,542
Let's go.

303
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,291
Ma'am, hi.

304
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,291
My name is Dr. Wallace.
I'm a psychiatrist.

305
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:17,250
Can we talk for a minute?
No.

306
00:15:22,542 --> 00:15:24,250
What do you want from me?

307
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,834
I'd like to help you
if I can.

308
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:29,041
There's nothing wrong
with Kenny.
I'm not suggesting there is,

309
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,917
but you did arm yourself.

310
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,291
And I think I can help you work
through some of your issues.

311
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,458
My son can talk to me.

312
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,333
I'm sure he can,
but does he?

313
00:15:39,792 --> 00:15:41,750
Elana's brain
is too large for her skull,

314
00:15:41,792 --> 00:15:43,709
and like any body part
that gets shoved

315
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,709
into an area that's too small,
it can cause pain.

316
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,709
But if I shave off
a small part of the bone

317
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,709
at the back of the skull,

318
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,709
remove a patch
of the brain covering,

319
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,041
and sew in a new, bigger one--
her pain goes away?

320
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,458
Maybe.
Likely.

321
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,166
But there are risks.

322
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,583
What are they?

323
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,667
Elana could die,
or your son could.

324
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:04,041
But there's another option.
I can position your body

325
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,166
to relieve the pressure
that's causing the pain.

326
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,500
I would work with you every day
for the rest of your pregnancy

327
00:16:08,542 --> 00:16:10,917
to help you manage it.
Dr. Montgomery?

328
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,667
What do you think?

329
00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:15,291
I think that both options
are viable.

330
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,709
Oh, please.
Don't be diplomatic.

331
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,250
Just tell me
what we should do.

332
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:25,291
I think you should have
the surgery.

333
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:29,041
I'll be there to monitor
the baby the entire time.

334
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:32,166
How soon can we do it?

335
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:35,500
Elana, no. I don't want
a life without you.

336
00:16:35,542 --> 00:16:39,834
With all this pain, what kind
of life have you had with me?

337
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,041
Oh.

338
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,834
I want the surgery.

339
00:16:51,542 --> 00:16:55,041
That's an interesting choice
of t-shirt.

340
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,041
It's anime.

341
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,583
"Takao's turn."
Genius kid finds a pen,

342
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,792
and anyone whose name
he writes with it dies.

343
00:17:01,834 --> 00:17:05,041
You're a fan boy?
I'm an action guy.

344
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,208
What about you?

345
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,000
Well, fantasy, mostly.

346
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,208
I like the ones

347
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,458
where the bad guys get
what's coming to them.

348
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,667
Well, that makes sense.
Is there something wrong
with that?

349
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:17,166
Not in theory.
I was protecting myself.

350
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:20,542
A weapon seems excessive
in response to humiliation.

351
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:23,792
Well, they did more.

352
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:26,000
You want to tell me
about it?

353
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:37,375
They kicked me,

354
00:17:37,417 --> 00:17:39,041
and they wouldn't stop

355
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,041
till I took off
my anime shirt.

356
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:45,500
Look, I don't want
their acceptance, Dr. Wallace.

357
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:48,917
What do you want?

358
00:17:48,959 --> 00:17:52,834
I guess I just want
what Dr. Freedman said,

359
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,792
to stay
in one school long enough

360
00:17:54,834 --> 00:17:57,375
that I can find kids...

361
00:17:57,417 --> 00:17:59,375
Like me.

362
00:17:59,417 --> 00:18:02,667
How many times
have you changed schools?

363
00:18:02,709 --> 00:18:05,166
Six times in two years.

364
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:08,291
That's why I didn't want
my mom to find out,

365
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,625
'cause she
just keeps freaking out.

366
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:15,333
Do you know what it's like
to be the new kid in school

367
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:18,166
over and over again?

368
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,041
Posterior fossa decompression,

369
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:24,041
that's risky
on a pregnant woman.

370
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:27,041
Yeah, she's in a lot of pain,
and if we can't help her,

371
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,041
she says she wants to abort.
Dad's desperate.

372
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,041
It's just--
it's a bad situation.

373
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,041
Y-You see how hard
all these people work

374
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,291
to become parents,

375
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:37,291
and the lengths that Naomi goes
through to get them pregnant,

376
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:41,041
and everything that you do,
and you wonder--i wonder--

377
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,458
you know,
is it even worth it?

378
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,875
How can you think that?
You have Maya.

379
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:48,041
Yeah, Maya who is 16,

380
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,667
has her own baby,

381
00:18:49,709 --> 00:18:52,458
and is married
to a guy named dink.

382
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:57,041
I mean, Naomi and I,
we did everything that we could,

383
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,125
a-and Maya had
so many advantages,

384
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,792
but still...

385
00:19:00,834 --> 00:19:04,875
I don't know. I-I look at Maya,
and I look at Betsey,

386
00:19:04,917 --> 00:19:09,125
and... I think sometimes,
it's just futile.

387
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:11,750
Okay. I'm not gonna repeat
this speech

388
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:14,709
to the mother who's about
to have brain surgery

389
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,667
to save her baby.

390
00:19:16,709 --> 00:19:19,208
I'm sorry. I...

391
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:23,041
Look, I feel really...
Really bad about Betsey.

392
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,709
I do. But I just
want to make sure

393
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,375
that we're on the same page
about her.

394
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,834
What do you mean?

395
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:33,291
I mean that if Violet
didn't take her,

396
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,959
that I still would've said no.

397
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,083
I already have a child,
Addison,

398
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,458
and a grandchild.

399
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:46,083
I don't.

400
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,500
Well, can you even--

401
00:19:47,542 --> 00:19:49,291
I don't know, Sam.

402
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,458
But you want to?
I don't know that either.

403
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,250
Well, then why are you
putting me on the spot?

404
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,375
Because... I want to believe

405
00:19:56,417 --> 00:19:59,375
that if I did want
to have a child with you,

406
00:19:59,417 --> 00:20:01,417
that you would.

407
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,500
Give her a minute.

408
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,417
You--you want to try?

409
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,291
Aah! Oh!

410
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,000
Can I stay with you forever?

411
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,041
Hey.

412
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:24,458
Hey.
So he--he's a good kid,
right?

413
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,625
He's a cool kid...
Actually.

414
00:21:27,667 --> 00:21:30,041
Well, in his way.

415
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,500
Were you a Kenny
growing up?

416
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:34,041
Smart but kind of different,

417
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:36,041
couldn't really find
your place?

418
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,041
Actually,
I bedded the prom queen

419
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:39,792
three years running,

420
00:21:39,834 --> 00:21:42,667
and the last one's sister, too.

421
00:21:42,709 --> 00:21:44,583
Okay.

422
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:47,041
But I...
I'm assuming you were.

423
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:53,000
Well, I was pretty into magic
for a while there.

424
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:56,959
That was, you know,
cool in its way.

425
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Okay, I got pushed around,
took a lot of dead arms,

426
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:02,041
the occasional linebacker
stuffing me into a garbage can

427
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:04,041
until the summer
after tenth grade.

428
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:05,333
I grew 5 inches.

429
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:09,041
I traded in my trick cards
for a date with Norma Jacks,

430
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:12,125
and no one ever
screwed with me again.

431
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:15,583
Kenny's dad bought him
his first deck of pokémon cards

432
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,041
when he was 7.

433
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:19,959
Now anime
is a world he can go to

434
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,959
where his dad is still alive,

435
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,417
and the dimwitted bullies
don't get to win.

436
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:27,041
That sounds like
a better place for him to be.

437
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:30,917
They're hurting him, Cooper,
and it's not the first time.

438
00:22:30,959 --> 00:22:32,917
And Kenny says
Jackie's response is always

439
00:22:32,959 --> 00:22:35,625
to pull him out of school.
Well, she wants to keep him
out of the line of fire.

440
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:37,417
Yeah, but figuring out
how to adapt,

441
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:40,041
learning how resilient
you can be, I mean, those skills

442
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:42,041
are essential to developing
into a competent adult.

443
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:44,041
I told Kenny
to stand up for himself

444
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:46,625
until he could find his people,
there'd be safety in numbers.

445
00:22:46,667 --> 00:22:49,041
But if Jackie's never gonna
give him that chance...
Well, then
he'll never learn to cope.

446
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:51,041
That's a point I'd like
to make to Jackie,

447
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:53,959
but... talk about worrying
someone's gonna kick your ass.

448
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,041
Kenny will be home soon,

449
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,792
so say
whatever you have to say and go.

450
00:22:58,834 --> 00:23:01,041
He mentioned you were
pulling him out of school.

451
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:04,000
The school where he was beaten?
Wouldn't you?

452
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:05,959
We know why you want
to shield him, but--

453
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,041
no "but." It's my job.

454
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:09,458
No, this has happened before.

455
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,667
Right? The bullying?

456
00:23:11,709 --> 00:23:13,041
Jackie, the worst in people,

457
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:15,709
it starts in high school,
but it doesn't stop there.

458
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,083
And part of growing up is
learning how to deal with that.

459
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:21,166
Now if--if you don't
give him time to adapt--

460
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:24,041
I will not send him back
to be attacked.

461
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:26,458
It takes everything I've got not
to go in there and kill them.

462
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,041
Tempting as that may be,
if you let me,

463
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:32,667
I can help Kenny develop
the skills to handle this.

464
00:23:32,709 --> 00:23:34,834
Skills?

465
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:36,041
He's 14 years old,

466
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:39,041
and he comes home and cries
every day, like a baby.

467
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:42,417
It kills me, but...

468
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:45,542
It also drives me crazy.

469
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:49,041
After my husband died,
I-I let it go for a while.

470
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:52,041
But now... I love him,

471
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:54,625
and I would do anything
for him.

472
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:56,041
God knows, I've tried.

473
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:57,417
Everything--

474
00:23:57,458 --> 00:24:01,917
pep talks,
and--and karate lessons, and...

475
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:06,125
Look, um...

476
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:08,041
Kenny's a wimp.

477
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:11,041
Right?
He's, uh, he's just...

478
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:13,041
He's just weak.

479
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:16,625
You know what that's like,
knowing that you...

480
00:24:16,667 --> 00:24:18,959
Raised a-a weak little baby?

481
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,750
Mom.

482
00:24:29,834 --> 00:24:32,041
It was the only thing
I could think to do.

483
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:34,875
Well, it seemed
like it worked.
Oh, just to see her smile...

484
00:24:34,917 --> 00:24:37,542
She'll need daily therapy,
at least at the beginning,

485
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:40,542
but I think we could see real
improvements in a few months.

486
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:43,083
Wait. You want her to stay
with us all that time?

487
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:46,041
I think we should adopt her.

488
00:24:46,083 --> 00:24:50,041
Violet, that's not
a good idea for any of us.

489
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:51,667
When you think about it,

490
00:24:51,709 --> 00:24:54,041
we are exactly
who should be doing this,

491
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:56,625
'cause I'm a therapist,
and--and even more than that,

492
00:24:56,667 --> 00:24:58,041
I get Betsey.

493
00:24:58,083 --> 00:25:01,041
That sense of being damaged?
I know what that can turn into.

494
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:02,917
We're building a family.

495
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:05,917
And there's no reason that
Betsey can't be a part of that.

496
00:25:05,959 --> 00:25:08,041
We can do this.

497
00:25:08,083 --> 00:25:09,917
Can we?

498
00:25:09,959 --> 00:25:12,000
Absolutely.

499
00:25:13,792 --> 00:25:15,375
You don't think
I can do this.

500
00:25:15,417 --> 00:25:17,375
You don't think
I have it in me after...

501
00:25:17,417 --> 00:25:20,041
I'm fine. I am fine now.

502
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:23,083
Violet, I'm not--
she's a child.

503
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:26,041
She needs someone.
She needs us.

504
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:28,709
And I am fine.

505
00:25:33,083 --> 00:25:35,041
If we could just
get Kenny to realize

506
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:37,667
that the rest of his life
is not gonna be like this.

507
00:25:37,709 --> 00:25:40,041
Yeah, well, we will.
I will.
Oh, yeah? You think
Jackie will let you?

508
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:42,041
Well, I can be persistent.
Hey.

509
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:44,041
Hey. Where are you off to?

00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,667
She's just got a headache,

688
00:34:11,709 --> 00:34:14,250
which is normal
after brain surgery.

689
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,667
It's okay.

690
00:34:21,709 --> 00:34:25,083
Come be with your wife.

691
00:34:28,625 --> 00:34:31,375
You did good today.

692
00:34:31,417 --> 00:34:33,041
I know.

693
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:39,000
Elana?

694
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:54,583
The baby...

695
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:56,041
He's kicking.

696
00:35:06,875 --> 00:35:10,041
What the hell did you do?

697
00:35:10,083 --> 00:35:13,041
I stabbed myself
in the stomach.

698
00:35:13,083 --> 00:35:15,667
What were you thinking?

699
00:35:15,709 --> 00:35:19,959
Suicide is never the answer.
It is never, ever the answer.

700
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,750
Yeah, I know that... now.

701
00:35:22,792 --> 00:35:24,834
Life is long,

702
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:27,208
and your horizons
are gonna get bigger.

703
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:30,000
But to try to get out
of it early, it's a huge--

704
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:32,375
when I was your age,
I was a runt, I had, like,

705
00:35:32,417 --> 00:35:35,250
two friends, and it felt like
it was never gonna get better.

706
00:35:35,291 --> 00:35:37,250
But you know what? It did.

707
00:35:37,291 --> 00:35:39,250
Somehow,
when you're not looking,

708
00:35:39,291 --> 00:35:41,041
things change.

709
00:35:41,083 --> 00:35:43,709
Now i'm, you know,
I'm a doctor,

710
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,667
I'm engaged to this
ridiculously beautiful woman,

711
00:35:45,709 --> 00:35:49,041
and I can
beat the crap out of, um...

712
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:50,792
Well, you know, some people.

713
00:35:50,834 --> 00:35:53,375
Anyway, the point is,
it gets better.

714
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:55,542
If you hang around,
it gets good.

715
00:35:55,583 --> 00:35:59,667
But you don't get to see that
if you're not here.

716
00:36:02,083 --> 00:36:04,000
Dad would be
so pissed at me.

717
00:36:06,125 --> 00:36:07,709
Yes, he would.

718
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:12,125
Look, I...

719
00:36:12,166 --> 00:36:14,709
I just...

720
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:17,792
I don't want to switch schools,
all right?

721
00:36:17,834 --> 00:36:20,250
Please just give me a chance.

722
00:36:22,875 --> 00:36:24,834
Um, only if those boys
are expelled,

723
00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:28,208
and every teacher there
knows exactly--
mom, mom, no.

724
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:32,625
I'll talk to Dr. Wallace.
I want to.

725
00:36:32,667 --> 00:36:34,333
And I'll be careful.

726
00:36:34,375 --> 00:36:38,333
But you have to
let me do this, okay?

727
00:36:38,375 --> 00:36:40,250
You have to.

728
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:44,542
Okay.

729
00:36:56,875 --> 00:36:59,792
Cooper already talked to me.

730
00:36:59,834 --> 00:37:02,792
I just asked his opinion.
I didn't ask him to--

731
00:37:02,834 --> 00:37:05,542
no, you didn't,
but you kinda did.

732
00:37:05,583 --> 00:37:08,041
He made the point, Pete.

733
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:10,041
I wanted to talk to you.

734
00:37:10,083 --> 00:37:12,291
I did.

735
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:14,291
But things have been
so good between us,

736
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:16,291
I just didn't want to risk--

737
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:18,500
Cooper's not my husband.

738
00:37:18,542 --> 00:37:21,500
And this tiptoeing around me,
it's not gonna work.

739
00:37:21,542 --> 00:37:24,792
You know, I mean, we're in this,
we're not going anywhere.

740
00:37:24,834 --> 00:37:28,000
We need to be able
to get mad and fight and...

741
00:37:28,041 --> 00:37:30,000
And know
that we'll get through

742
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:33,875
whatever we need
to get through.

743
00:37:33,917 --> 00:37:36,417
You don't want
to adopt Betsey.

744
00:37:38,041 --> 00:37:40,000
It is what it is.

745
00:37:40,041 --> 00:37:45,041
As much as I feel
for Betsey...

746
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:47,709
We need time.

747
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:50,041
I know.

748
00:37:50,083 --> 00:37:52,750
But you have to know that...

749
00:37:52,792 --> 00:37:55,834
That I'm fine.

750
00:37:55,875 --> 00:37:57,625
I am fine.

751
00:37:57,667 --> 00:37:59,959
You are.

752
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:07,291
I miss Dell.

753
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:22,792
Hey.

754
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:24,583
Hey.

755
00:38:26,083 --> 00:38:29,542
So Pete and Violet
aren't going to adopt Betsey.

756
00:38:29,583 --> 00:38:31,667
That's good...
For Betsey

757
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:34,834
and for everyone.

758
00:38:36,792 --> 00:38:39,041
Dell used to make me crazy.

759
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:41,667
But the thing is,
he was there...

760
00:38:41,709 --> 00:38:44,041
For Maya.

761
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:48,041
He died taking care
of my child.

762
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:50,750
Sam, no one expected you
to take Betsey,

763
00:38:50,792 --> 00:38:52,500
including me.

764
00:38:52,542 --> 00:38:54,500
