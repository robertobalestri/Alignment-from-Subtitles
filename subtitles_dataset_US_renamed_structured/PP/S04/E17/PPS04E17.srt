She's also a shrink.

No. I didn't eat anything

00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:55,041

00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:01,375
Okay, Addison.
We're past this.

00:02:01,417 --> 00:02:03,959

No. Not at all.

56
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:37,375
How is it possible

57
00:02:37,417 --> 00:02:40,041
that I'm cancer free
and pain free

58
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,834
after all this time?

59
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,834
Good oncologist,
even better pain specialist,

60
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:46,041
and a pretty good
support group, right?

61
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,166
You guys are amazing.

62
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:51,041

all the painful radiation.

00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,417
We're just
the cheering section.

64
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,417
You have been positive
from the very beginning.

65
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,041
You've never wavered.

66
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,750
And you...

67
00:02:57,792 --> 00:03:00,000
Apart from the minor detail

68
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:02,083
of being the surrogate
for our baby...

69
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:03,917
Well, it's an aunt's dream.

70
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:06,709
I get to spend quality time with
my niece before anybody else,

71
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,125
including her mommy.

72
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:09,750
I expect baby pictures.

73
00:03:09,792 --> 00:03:11,041
Oh!

74
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,041
Claudine?
Sit back down, slowly.

75
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:15,041
Ah.
Is it the baby?

76
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,125
Ooh. I don't know. Um...

77
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,750
I'm gonna go get our o.B.
To take a look at you, okay?
Okay.

78
00:03:19,792 --> 00:03:21,750
I'm gonna go get the lamaze
pillow from the car,

79
00:03:21,792 --> 00:03:23,750
just in case.
Wait, wait.

80
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,125
This could be it.

81
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,625
Anyone hear anything
from Naomi?

82
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,542
Uh, uh, I-I left her
a message, but no.

83
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:34,875
Maybe she reconsidered
and ran off with fife.
I talked to fife.

84
00:03:34,917 --> 00:03:37,250
He's still here
in a hotel room, waiting.

85
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,333
Where is the damn antacid?
Sorry. I needed it.

86
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:42,083
I felt the same
before my book party.

87
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:45,041
That's revisionist history.
If you recall, on his big day,

88
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,041
they made a cake
that looked like Sam,

89
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:50,083
and he wouldn't let any of us
eat it. He was staring at it

90
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,875
with this smile on his face that
matched the smile on the cake.

91
00:03:52,917 --> 00:03:55,667
Hey, Addison,
can you do a consult?

92
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:57,458
Sure. Thank you.

93
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,667
No, it's just, uh, you know,
my book comes out, uh, tomorrow,

94
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:02,458
and, uh, people are
gonna be reading it.

95
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,041
That's what people do
with books.
I-I know. I know.

96
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,875
Violet, if this is about what
that petty little pseudo shrink

97
00:04:07,917 --> 00:04:10,750
wrote in the "times"...
Do you think
I lack boundaries?

98
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,917
I don't lack boundaries.

99
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:18,083
Cooper?

100
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,667
I'm not an expert, so...

101
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:22,959
It doesn't take
an expert to realize that first,

102
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,667
you are great at your job,
and second, if everyone else

103
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:28,542
loves your book except one
petty reviewer, screw 'em.

104
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:31,917
Yeah. Want me to quote you what
people wrote about my book?

105
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,291
"There is a clear pattern
of narcissism

106
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,875
"in Violet Turner's
brand of therapy.

107
00:04:37,917 --> 00:04:39,250
"She comfortably inhabits

108
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:40,875
"the role
of emotional seductress,

109
00:04:40,917 --> 00:04:43,041
"taking the vulnerable
to where she wants them

110
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:47,667
in order to achieve
her own end goals."

111
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:49,291
Blah, blah, blah.

112
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,792
Like I said, screw 'em.

113
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:54,375
Yeah, I mean, the review's
not entirely wrong, and...

114
00:04:54,417 --> 00:04:56,333
Right?

115
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,792
Screw you.
No, seriously, Cooper.

116
00:04:58,834 --> 00:05:00,792
I'm putting myself out there.

117
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:02,542
What have you ever done?

118
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:12,208
So wh-wh-what time
is the party tonight?

119
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,750
Oh, god. Um,
uh, we were just--

120
00:05:18,792 --> 00:05:21,291
no, please. This is not
the first time we've, uh,

121
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,291
caught a couple kissing.

122
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,000
Addison, uh...
This is claudine...

123
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,041
How do you do?
And Elliot.

124
00:05:28,417 --> 00:05:31,041
Elliot is married
to claudine's sister.

125
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,125
Oh. Oh.

126
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,041
So I get Kyle wasserman
into an arm bar,

127
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:48,041
and I'm about to end it--
remember, wasserman
has never been pinned.

128
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:50,500
Then I just got dizzy.
Next thing I remember,

129
00:05:50,542 --> 00:05:53,208
the coaches
are standing over me.
Any dizziness
before that day?

130
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,250
Never.
And how about since?

131
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:57,417
I was a little light-headed
after practice yesterday.

132
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,625
You're back
at practice already?

133
00:05:59,667 --> 00:06:01,625
Oh, not at school.
Coach won't let me.

134
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:04,458
Just at home with my dad.
Conference finals
are tomorrow, Dr. Freedman.

135
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,458
Place is going to be packed
with scouts.

136
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,041
And after the wasserman match,
Tyler has to perform.

137
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:12,000
Yeah, we need a full ride,
division I.
Okay.

138
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,041
Tyler's been wrestling
for years with no problem.

139
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,250
He's a healthy kid.
Okay, I do hear
a slight heart murmur.

140
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,875
So I would be more comfortable
if our cardiac specialist,

141
00:06:18,917 --> 00:06:21,333
Dr. Bennett,
took a look at him.

142
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,583
Can we do this today?

143
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:27,041
It's just--we have to make sure
Ty wrestles this week.

144
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,792
His scholarship--everything
depends on him being there and--

145
00:06:29,834 --> 00:06:32,041
okay, we need you
to sign this.

146
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,041
Coach Patterson won't let him
compete without it.

147
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,500
Well, look, I know
how important this is to you.

148
00:06:36,542 --> 00:06:38,500
If Dr. Bennett says
his heart is fine,

149
00:06:38,542 --> 00:06:40,709
I will sign it.

150
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,583
This isn't some tawdry thing.
It's--

151
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:50,709
crazy. I'm--even if
it makes sense to you,

152
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,041
you--you're cheating
on your wife with her sister--

153
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,083
her sister who is carrying
your child.

154
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,041
W-Wait. That baby is--

155
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,041
no, no.

156
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:03,959
We did in vitro with my sperm
and claudine's egg

157
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,291
before any of this happened.

158
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,291
Well, Elliot, I don't know
what I can say.

159
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,917
H-How do you think
this is gonna turn out?

160
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,917
I don't expect you
to get it.

161
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:15,709
I mean,
before Lorraine was sick,

162
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,417
things weren't great
between us.

163
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:22,041
And we tried to work it out,
but then the cancer came on.

164
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:25,083
And claudine and I,
we took care of her.

165
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:28,458
Spent a lot of time together,
talking and...

166
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,458
Trying to laugh through
how scared we were.

167
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,542
And claudine, she--
she understood me.

168
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:37,917
Those feelings,

169
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:40,917
they kept getting stronger
until one night--

170
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:44,041
and now you're here. Fine.

171
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,750
But... Lorraine deserves
to know.

172
00:07:46,792 --> 00:07:48,125
You get that, right?

173
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,667
Sh-she'll know. She'll know.

174
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:52,875
After the baby's born...

175
00:07:52,917 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm gonna leave Lorraine
to be with claudine.

176
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,709
Hey.

177
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,041
Hey.

178
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,709
What was that about?

179
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,083
What?

180
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,709
In the kitchen.
You mad at Violet?

181
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,917
No.

182
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,041
Are you jealous
of Violet?

183
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,041
Why would I
be jealous?

184
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:20,083
Well, you tell me.
Violet is a great shrink,

185
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,333
and now
she's a published author.

186
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,208
Naomi builds hospitals
all around the world

187
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,500
in addition to performing
miracles at a fertility clinic.

188
00:08:27,542 --> 00:08:29,500
And Pete,
he's already saved lives

189
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:32,083
in basically every country
Naomi's going to, not to mention

190
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,709
being an E.R. doc
and an expert in critical care

191
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,083
and infectious diseases.

192
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:39,083
And you're one of the youngest
chiefs of staffs in the country,

193
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,083
and everyone is doing
something special--

194
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,750
everyone except for me.

195
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:45,834
Grow up, Cooper.

196
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:54,250
You look like crap.

197
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,667
Ugh. Thank you.

198
00:08:56,709 --> 00:08:59,333
Flu?
You don't feel warm.

199
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,333
Did you eat anything weird?

200
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,458
No.
So what's wrong

201
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,250
other than, you know,
you lookin' like--
I don't know.

202
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:08,250
Amelia, I just don't
feel well. Okay?

203
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:11,208
I'm exhausted.
I feel nauseous.

204
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,583
I just... I don't know.

205
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:16,208
Maybe it's just some sort
of... delayed reaction

206
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,208
to the bizzy stress.

207
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,166
Maybe.
Have you gained any weight?

208
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,166
Okay, now you're
just being mean.

209
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:27,375
Are you peeing a lot?
Your boobs--are they tender?

210
00:09:27,417 --> 00:09:30,250
Okay, you are a neurosurgeon.
I am a gynecologist.

211
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:33,583
All right, if I were,
I would know, and I'm not.

212
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:36,041
Okay? I can't be.
Do you and Sam
use protection?

213
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:39,083
Amelia, I'm telling you,
I can't--
are you late?

214
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,208
Yes.

215
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,667
But I can't be.
I mean, I don't think--

216
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:47,667
you're preggers!

217
00:09:47,709 --> 00:09:49,500
This is awesome.

218
00:09:56,542 --> 00:09:58,667
Auntie Amelia.

219
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:00,709
Even though you divorced
my brother,

220
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,083
I'm still gonna be
your kid's aunt, right?

221
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,083
Amelia,
for me to get pregnant,

222
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:07,041
it would take a miracle.

223
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:10,041
A miracle that I am
going to spoil rotten.

224
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:13,417
I think I'm gonna take her
to Paris for her 13th birthday.

225
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:16,625
You want to come?
You are out of your mind.
I am not pregnant.

226
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:19,834
If only there was
some way to know for sure.

227
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,417
Wait. Wait.

228
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:25,041
I was out shopping,
and I saw these tests--

229
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,542
knock it off.
Just pee on a stick.

230
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,542
I'm busy.
You are stalling.

231
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:32,000
You like the idea.

232
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,125
Admit it. Admit it.

233
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:37,417
I am not gonna go away
until you admit that--
go!

234
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:47,083
See that?

235
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,041
That slight thickening
of the septal wall

236
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:52,458
and an elevated flow
across the l.V. Outflow tract.

237
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,458
Looks like
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

238
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,750
It's borderline.

239
00:10:56,792 --> 00:10:58,750
Does that put Tyler
at risk for an arrhythmia?

240
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:00,792
Well, he may never have
a problem.

241
00:11:00,834 --> 00:11:03,041
There are cases, rare,
but they happen,

242
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,166
when the most
seemingly healthy kid

243
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,041
could just die suddenly.

244
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,041
Is there any way to know?

245
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,792
Well, we could start
with an m.R.I., watch him

246
00:11:11,834 --> 00:11:14,083
over the next few months.
In two days, it won't matter.

247
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,083
I mean, this kid has a chance
to change his life.

248
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,083
He can get a scholarship
to college.

249
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,333
I don't think
he can afford it otherwise.

250
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:23,000
But he has to compete
in the conference finals,

251
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:25,959
and given the circumstances--
well, I'm not saying
he can't wrestle.

252
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,750
You said he could drop dead
if he does.
Is there a chance? Yes.
But is it greater

253
00:11:28,792 --> 00:11:30,792
than the chance he could get
into an automobile accident

254
00:11:30,834 --> 00:11:33,250
on the way to the meet?
Given that his only symptoms

255
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:36,959
are a little dizziness,
probably not.
So you'd let him wrestle?

256
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,959
I mean, if his whole future
depends on it,

257
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,375
it's--it's a calculated risk.
Well, I mean,

258
00:11:41,417 --> 00:11:44,125
you never take risks
with kids' lives, Sam, ever.

259
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:47,166
Well, that's not
the way it works.

260
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,792
You don't think I wanted
to lock Maya in the house

261
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:53,000
and not let her ride a bike
or drive a car or ski?

262
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,375
No, you can't do that.

263
00:11:54,417 --> 00:11:56,375
You can't eliminate
all risk in life.

264
00:11:56,417 --> 00:12:00,291
And given what you're telling me
this kid has at stake...

265
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:06,083
I don't understand.

266
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:09,041
Lorraine and Elliot have been
married for what, eight years?

267
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,375
You understand it.
You just don't like it.

268
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:14,041
Yeah. It's just--life isn't
a cheap romance novel, you know?

269
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:17,041
It's supposed to be about making
a commitment and honoring it.

270
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,667
Sometimes. And other times,
for other people,

271
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:21,583
it's about passion.

272
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,834
You think passion
is enough?

273
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,041
You don't?

274
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,667
To make an adult relationship
work, you need more.

275
00:12:28,709 --> 00:12:30,667
Come on. You're talking
about claudine and Elliot

276
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,667
like they're
some insubstantial fling.

277
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:35,458
I mean, they're both grown-ups
who are taking a risk--

278
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,208
a huge risk--

279
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,417
because they found each other
and fell in love.

280
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,834
Just because a risk is big
doesn't make it worthwhile.

281
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,834
I feel for Lorraine.
Of course I do.

282
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:48,291
But on some level, I mean,
don't you think it's brave,

283
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,750
what Elliot and claudine
want to do?

284
00:12:50,792 --> 00:12:54,041
Mm. Mnh-mnh. Stop looking
at me like that, Pete.

285
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,041
This is not about
Sam and me.

286
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,417
Of course it is.

287
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:00,417
Sam and I told Naomi
that we were in a relationship.

288
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:03,333
Okay.
Who's gonna tell Lorraine?

289
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:12,709
Okay, claudine.

290
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,750
You're in the very early stages
of labor.

291
00:13:15,792 --> 00:13:17,250
You're just
3 centimeters dilated.

292
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,250
So you're
gonna be here a while.

293
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:22,458
I will call your regular
ob-gyn.
No, my o.B.'S gone all week.

294
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,083
And I don't know the woman
who's on call for her.

295
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,083
Can't you do it?

296
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:30,500
Okay, but--
and maybe you could
call Lorraine.

297
00:13:30,542 --> 00:13:32,375
She's so excited.
No.

298
00:13:32,417 --> 00:13:34,792
I think
that you should call Lorraine.

299
00:13:34,834 --> 00:13:37,166
If you mean we should
tell her, I can't.

300
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,875
We can't. Not--not yet.

301
00:13:39,917 --> 00:13:42,792
Don't you think that she
has a right to know?

302
00:13:42,834 --> 00:13:45,417
You know I love Lorraine,
right?

303
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,709
And I'd do anything for her.

304
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,125
I mean, I am.
I'm doing this.

305
00:13:51,792 --> 00:13:55,125
Ever since we were little,
Lorraine wanted to be a mom.

306
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:58,291
She just... she knew.

307
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:01,041
I never did.

308
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:04,208
Maybe it was too many
Princess movies growing up,

309
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,834
but me?

310
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,041
I only
wanted to fall in love.

311
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:12,750
Which is probably
why it never happened for me.

312
00:14:12,792 --> 00:14:14,959
And then there was Elliot.

313
00:14:17,417 --> 00:14:20,375
At first, he was just
my big sister's boyfriend,

314
00:14:20,417 --> 00:14:25,125
who... I mostly resented
for taking her away from me.

315
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:28,959
But once my sister got sick

316
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,208
and we really
got to know each other,

317
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,041
something happened,

318
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:37,583
something... amazing.

319
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,792
And the more we tried
to hold back,

320
00:14:39,834 --> 00:14:41,792
the harder it got,

321
00:14:41,834 --> 00:14:43,166
until...

322
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,417
I love Lorraine,
Dr. Montgomery.

323
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,417
I do,
and I always will,

324
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:54,041
but now, especially since
I'm carrying Elliot's baby--

325
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,458
okay, stop, claudine.
All right?

326
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,041
Just think about that,
all right?

327
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:01,041
You're pregnant. Your hormones
are all over the place.

328
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,375
They can overwhelm you,
and--
no, that's not what it is.

329
00:15:03,417 --> 00:15:06,041
I mean, I wish it was.
Believe me.

330
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,041
But... real love

331
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:11,250
can't be confused
with anything else.

332
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,000
Then tell your sister that.

333
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:15,041
I understand that
you can't choose

334
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:17,041
who you fall in love with.

335
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,291
But you can choose
to be honest.

336
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:25,917
I reviewed your scan
with a heart specialist,

337
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:28,917
and as much as I would like
for you to compete and to win,

338
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,959
- I can't let you take that risk.
- But I-I feel fine.

339
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,875
I can wrestle.
I have to wrestle.

340
00:15:34,917 --> 00:15:38,417
It's just, Tyler has worked
so hard, and this is his dream.

341
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,041
We're talking about

342
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,125
a potentially
fatal problem here.
What are the odds

343
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:44,542
that something bad happens to
Tyler--10 to 1, 100 to 1, what?

344
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:47,625
I can't give you odds.
Then why should we listen
to you?

345
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:49,291
Look,
I know my own body.

346
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:52,041
I haven't been feeling dizzy.
I'm--I'm feeling great.

347
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,709
I can make weight.
You're way out of line here.
We're his parents,

348
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,959
and we say what he can
or can't do, not you.
Except that you need
my signature

349
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,250
on Tyler's
medical release form.
We'll get another doctor.

350
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,166
Randy.
I'm saying Tyler could die.

351
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,417
What about that
don't you understand?

352
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:08,041
I'm sorry, but finals aren't
gonna happen for you, Tyler.

353
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:11,083
Let's go. Now, Tyler.

354
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:30,000
Dr. Freedman.

355
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,834
Hey, Tyler.

356
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:34,041
Come in.

357
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:35,750
Is everything okay?

358
00:16:35,792 --> 00:16:38,041
Nothing is okay.

359
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:40,125
Uh...

360
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,959
My mom got laid off
last year.

361
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,792
My dad is working double shifts
just to pay the rent.

362
00:16:46,834 --> 00:16:48,792
I have a part-time job
on the weekends--

363
00:16:48,834 --> 00:16:50,375
yeah, I understand. I do.

364
00:16:50,417 --> 00:16:52,792
No, you don't.

365
00:16:52,834 --> 00:16:55,000
Look, I'm the only one
in my family

366
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:57,041
with the opportunity
to go to college.

367
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,166
Without a scholarship,
I'm just gonna end up

368
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:01,375
doing the same thing
my parents are.
You don't know that.

369
00:17:01,417 --> 00:17:03,625
Just like you don't know
something bad will happen to me

370
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:06,041
if I wrestle tomorrow.
I can't let you
take that risk.

371
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,458
But that's my decision.

372
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,959
Sometimes, when you are
so close to a situation...

373
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,333
You can't see it--
you can't see it clearly.

374
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:15,333
And I'm telling you--
stop. Just stop
telling me things

375
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,583
a-and just help me.

376
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:22,125
I think I am, even if it doesn't
seem like it to you.
You're not.

377
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,750
But i-i-th--i think I am,
okay?
You're not.

378
00:17:24,792 --> 00:17:27,041
I made a cardiac m.R.I.
Appointment for you tomorrow,

379
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,041
and I left word
for your folks,

380
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:33,041

It's the first step.
You're scared to take a risk.

I'm not.

382
