Previously
on "private practice"...

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,917
Cooper, Charlotte was raped.
 It's number 2.

4
00:00:11,959 --> 00:00:14,917
The D.A. won't prosecute
Lee McHenry.
You'll do it again, Lee.
You'll rape another woman.

5
00:00:14,959 --> 00:00:18,083
- You don't know me.
- That man cannot go free.

6
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:20,750
I will get a gun,
make it look like a mugging.

7
00:00:20,792 --> 00:00:23,041
I'm sorry, Susan.
The cancer has spread,

8
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:24,750
and there's nothing I can do.

9
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:26,417
You will save her life!

10
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:28,667
- Addison.
- I'm marrying Susan.

11
00:00:28,709 --> 00:00:30,792
I know the cancer's come back.
I signed a d.N.R.,

12
00:00:30,834 --> 00:00:32,875
and you can't tell bizzy.

13
00:00:43,917 --> 00:00:46,875
She's crashing.
I need a c.B.C., chem panel,

14
00:00:46,917 --> 00:00:49,834
and a blood culture times 3.
And hang 2 liters of saline,
wide-open.

15
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:51,375
What's happening?

16
00:00:51,417 --> 00:00:53,917
Set up a central line
and start a dopamine drip.

17
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:56,417
Addison,
tell me what is happening.

18
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:59,041
Can't get a blood pressure.
She's in shock.

19
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:00,458
Probably septic.

20
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,083
Okay, line's in.

21
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:06,041
Titrate the dopamine
to a pressure of 90.

22
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,458
Addison?

23
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,875
It's gonna take a minute for
the medicine to take effect.

24
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:20,041
85.

25
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:22,667
90.

26
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:25,041
95.
Okay, pressure's coming up.

27
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:27,125
Go ahead and hang
the first dose of antibiotics.

28
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:30,500
Is sh--is she--is Susan
gonna be all right?

29
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:33,750
She's gonna be all right.

30
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:40,709
Whew.

31
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,709
Oh, hey, Amelia.
Have you got a minute?

32
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,709
No. I have not heard
from Addison about Susan,

33
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,709
and I'm late
for the dorkfest that is

34
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,709
the neurology department
monthly breakfast roundtable.

35
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,458
That sounds horrible.

36
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,041
It is. It's boring
and self-congratulatory.

37
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,458
Can you give me a reason,
any reason, for a no-show?

38
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,041
Lizzie hagan. Army vet,
just back from Afghanistan.

39
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:02,041
I.e.d. Explosion--
lost her right eye,

40
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:05,041
decreased vision in her left
because of shrapnel

41
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,041
lodged in her brain.
Tough choice.

42
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:09,041
Help a wounded soldier
see again

43
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:11,041
or endure
a bunch of lame old men

44
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:13,959
joking about my frontal lobes.

45
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:17,792
Eric and I, we had just
found out that morning

46
00:02:17,834 --> 00:02:19,166
that I was pregnant.

47
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:21,166
We didn't even have time
to celebrate

48
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,166
before they put us
in the convoy.

49
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,166
He didn't want me to go,

50
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:27,041
but I couldn't say no.

51
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:30,959
Anyway, Eric and I, we were--
we were sitting together

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,041
and we were whispering
back and forth

53
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:35,583
about a spring wedding.

54
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:38,041
And, um...

55
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:40,208
And then we hit the I.E.D.

56
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,208
And everything
went really bright

57
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,041
and then really dark.

58
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:47,041
And I was
thrown out of our Humvee.

59
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:50,041
And I tried to get up
and look for Eric,

60
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:53,041
but I couldn't see.

61
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,041
Take your time, Lizzie.

62
00:03:00,542 --> 00:03:03,041
I didn't have time to process
what had happened to me

63
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:05,625
until I got to the hospital

64
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:08,083
and I realized
that I could barely see

65
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,333
any of the doctors
who were talking.

66
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:13,125
How's the vision
in your left eye?

67
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:17,041
I can see shapes and forms,
but it's pretty blurry.

68
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:21,125
Is there...
Anything you can do?

69
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,125
Well,
let me take some scans.

70
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,959
Depending on how the shrapnel
is compressing your optic nerve,

71
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,667
I may be able to remove it.

72
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:33,375
Losing Eric and my injuries,

73
00:03:33,417 --> 00:03:36,041
it's just
all been really hard.

74
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,542
But since Natasha was born
two months ago,

75
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:41,709
I-I have to be hopeful,
for her sake and for mine.

76
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,583
We're all each other has.

77
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:46,375
Lizzie, is Natasha
still latching on?

78
00:03:46,417 --> 00:03:48,041
I think so. Yeah. Why?

79
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,083
She's turning blue.

80
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,709
What's wrong?
Here. She's not breathing.

81
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,041
Amelia, bag.
What--what's going on?
What's happening to her?

82
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,041
Dr. Wilder is trying
to resuscitate your baby.

83
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:59,875
Oh, god.
Is she gonna be okay?

84
00:03:59,917 --> 00:04:03,250
You--you have to save her.
Natasha?

85
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,250
All right.
What do we have?

86
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,291
White male, 30s,
stabbed in the chest.
Stable?

87
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:10,291
He's lost a lot of blood,
and there's a knife.

88
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,917
So he was hitting you?

89
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:14,959
He's... I didn't mean to,
but he wouldn't stop!

90
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,333
And I saw the knife,
and I just grabbed it,

91
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,333
and...
Let's--let's go.

92
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:22,458
Blood pressure, pulse?
130 over 90. Pulse is 120.

93
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,250
Okay, I'm gonna need
a portable ultrasound.

94
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,250
Am I gonna make it, doc?

95
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:30,250
We're gonna do the best we can.
What's your name, sir?

96
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:33,542
Lee...

97
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:36,208
McHenry.

98
00:04:49,542 --> 00:04:52,041
I was just checking on Susan
and I heard.

99
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,917
What happened?
He was using his girlfriend
as a punching bag.

100
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:57,667
She decided to defend herself
using this.
Is he gonna make it?

101
00:04:57,709 --> 00:04:59,041
I don't know.

102
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,041
The blade cut all the way
through the lung tissue.

103
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,667
It's lodged near the heart,
acting like a stopper,

104
00:05:03,709 --> 00:05:06,709
preventing him
from bleeding out.
What happens
if you take it out?

105
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,083
Well, right now he'll die.

106
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,583
We have to wait until
his blood is clotting better

107
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,583
before we can operate.
When will that be?

108
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:15,041
I don't know. If he's lucky
it'll be before

109
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,709
the pressure builds too much
and his heart ruptures.
Someone should give
his girlfriend

110
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,375
a medal for doing this.

111
00:05:19,417 --> 00:05:22,000
Does Charlotte know
that he's here?

112
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:27,041
Uh, clearly, Lizzie's eyesight
is worse than she's telling us.

113
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:29,709
It was an accident.
An accident?
If we hadn't been there--

114
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,834
what happened?
One of Pete's patient's

115
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:34,291
smothered her baby
while breast-feeding.
Is the baby okay?

116
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,375
For now.
Amelia, she--

117
00:05:36,417 --> 00:05:39,000
well, now it does happen.
New moms fall asleep

118
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,083
or--or hold the baby
too tightly.
This mom's blind.

119
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:44,041
Partially blind.
With the proper instruction,

120
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,041
it won't happen again.
You don't know that.

121
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,375
There's a million complications
that blind parents face

122
00:05:48,417 --> 00:05:51,375
that seeing parents
just don't.
But blind parents
raise children all the time

123
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:53,500
with help.
Single mom,
no family around.

124
00:05:53,542 --> 00:05:55,333
Can she afford a nanny?

125
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,125
Not on disability.

126
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:59,834
She is the mother of that child.
She has a right to raise her.

127
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:02,417
As along as the child
is protected.

128
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:05,083
If she can't do that, then--
then we need to help her.

129
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:15,667
Bizzy, you should
go back to the hotel,

130
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,041
get some rest.

131
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,875
No, not while Susan's here.

132
00:06:18,917 --> 00:06:21,041
The chemotherapy has
suppressed her immune system,

133
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:24,542
and she had trouble fighting off
the infection, but now--

134
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:28,000
she's fine. She just
needs sleep, and you do, too.

135
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,041
Go.

136
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:34,041
Call me if she wakes.

137
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,917
She loves her...

138
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:41,041
Mm-hmm.

139
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,500
Very much.

140
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,291
Yeah, she does.

141
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:51,667
I was just coming to see you.
Janet, uh, Pete Wilder,

142
00:06:51,709 --> 00:06:53,667
the doctor who referred
Lizzie to me.

143
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:55,583
Hello.
Hi. You know Lizzie?

144
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:58,458
Eric, my son,
was her boyfriend.

145
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,125
I'm so sorry
for your loss.
Thank you.

146
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:04,333
I didn't realize Eric
had family nearby.
Actually, I live in San Diego,

147
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,875
but when Dr. Shepherd called
this morning,

148
00:07:06,917 --> 00:07:09,041
I drove straight up.

149
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,041
I'm here to take home
my son's baby.

150
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,458
Sam?

151
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,250
Is he...

152
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,041
How bad is it?

153
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,083
He's got a knife in his chest.

154
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:29,250
He's not stable enough
for me to operate,

155
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,250
so I can't remove it yet.

156
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:34,166
Charlotte, there's nothing
for you to do here.

157
00:07:35,792 --> 00:07:39,000
If he dies,
would anyone be surprised?

158
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:45,041
Look, I know what it's like
to want somebody dead,

159
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:47,250
someone who deserves it,

160
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,625
but to actually allow
for that to happen...

161
00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:53,375
Who would care?

162
00:07:54,917 --> 00:07:57,375
Sam, if i--

163
00:07:57,417 --> 00:08:00,417
Code blue, bay three.
Code blue, bay three.

164
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,000
That's Lee. He's crashing.

165
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:06,750
What do you want me to do,
Charlotte?

166
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,500
His sats are dropping.

167
00:08:27,542 --> 00:08:30,166
All right.
Give me an intubation tray.

168
00:08:31,417 --> 00:08:34,792
Can you...
Can you take it out?

169
00:08:34,834 --> 00:08:37,583
I have to open up your chest,
which means putting you

170
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,041
on a bypass machine.

171
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,041
That's gonna thin your blood,
and right now,

172
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,041
with the damage to your lung,

173
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:46,125
you'd bleed out
and die on the table.

174
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,208
Now I'm gonna put
a tube down your throat

175
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,166
to suction all the blood out
so you don't drown.

176
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:56,542
But the knife--
it's bad either way.

177
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:59,375
Please don't let me die.

178
00:08:59,417 --> 00:09:00,750
Shh.

179
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:06,041
You're friends with her.

180
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,667
Yeah.
She's--

181
00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:12,041
I don't want to hear anything
you have to say about her.

182
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,834
Sedate him.

183
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,458
I didn't find out
about the pregnancy

184
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,792
until after I buried Eric.

185
00:09:22,834 --> 00:09:27,041
The army sent me his things,
and I, uh...

186
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:31,458
I found a, uh,
a half-written letter.

187
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,458
So I called Lizzie.

188
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,709
She had just gotten out
of the hospital.

189
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,083
She was seven months pregnant
and scared, and i--

190
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,291
I told her
to come see our doctors,

191
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:43,041
have the baby in San Diego.
You wanted to help.

192
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,041
Of course.
Maybe I pushed too hard.

193
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,041
First she stopped returning
my calls,

194
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:51,709
then she moved apartments
without telling us.

195
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,500
We didn't even know
she had given birth

196
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:56,959
until a week after
it happened.

197
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,041
Look, I have nothing
against Lizzie,

198
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,750
but Natasha
is my granddaughter,

199
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:03,750
and I have
a responsibility to her,

200
00:10:03,792 --> 00:10:05,333
which is...

201
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,333
The baby
should come back with me.

202
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,041
And what happens to Lizzie?

203
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,458
She can stay here and get
the medical help she needs.

204
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,041
We'll bring her down
for visits, on--on holidays.

205
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,625
So you want her
to give up her baby?

206
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:19,917
Do you think
she'll have a choice?
Dr. Shepherd can operate

207
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:22,041
and help Lizzie regain
the vision in her good eye.

208
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,291
Maybe. I mean, even if
her scans look good,

209
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,750
there's no guarantee
it'll be successful.

210
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,458
But I know
Lizzie wants to try.

211
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,041
Then you'll try.
But if you can't give Lizzie
back her eyesight,

212
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:36,000
Natasha is coming home
with me.

213
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:42,542
Have you heard
from Addison?

214
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,875
Yeah. Susan's stabilized,

215
00:10:44,917 --> 00:10:48,500
and she's responding
to antibiotics, so...
Oh, good.
Bizzy must be relieved.

216
00:10:48,542 --> 00:10:51,458
Yeah.
I got Lizzie's scans back.
You want to take a look?

217
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,041
No, no, no, no.
Let me pick you up.

218
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:58,583
Okay. Okay, well, i'm--
i'm--I'm here. I'll be here.

219
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:03,291
Um...

220
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,792
Lee McHenry

221
00:11:05,834 --> 00:11:08,792
is in the I.C.U.
With a knife in his chest.

222
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,000
Oh, Cooper.
What? Are you kidding?

223
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:13,792
What?
Yeah, and Sam wants
to try to save him.

224
00:11:13,834 --> 00:11:16,500
Well, that's his job.
If Violet had been attacked, I
wouldn't want Sam being a hero.

225
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:19,041
He's supposed
to let him die?
How is Charlotte?

226
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,792
She can barely talk about it.
I...

227
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:27,667
I can't believe
this nightmare is not over.

228
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:34,041
Hey.

229
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,750
You're looking better.

230
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:38,792
Now I just need
to get outta here.

231
00:11:38,834 --> 00:11:40,959
All of the tubes
and the drugs--

232
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,166
and no offense,
the doctors...

233
00:11:45,417 --> 00:11:48,041
I'm just so tired of it all.

234
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,667
And poor bizzy.

235
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,667
Oh, she'll be fine.

236
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:53,667
She's nothing
if not resilient.

237
00:11:55,792 --> 00:11:59,583
In her way, she's...

238
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,500
Amazing.

239
00:12:01,542 --> 00:12:05,208
It was a nice wedding,
wasn't it?

240
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,625
Mm-hmm.

241
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:13,500
Oh, my...

242
00:12:13,542 --> 00:12:16,458
Chest.
I need a blood gas
and a bolus of heparin. Go.

243
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,625
Hurts... to breathe.

244
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:22,041
Susan, you may have thrown
a clot in your lung.

245
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,417
You said before
that you didn't--

246
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:25,625
no.

247
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:28,417
No heroics. Please.

248
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,542
Bizzy.

249
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,834
I'll get her.

250
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:39,208
Bizzy.

251
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:45,959
Hey.

252
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:49,834
You okay?

253
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:52,834
It's never gonna be over,
is it?

254
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,041
It could be.

255
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:58,625
If I tell Sam to kill...

256
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:01,291
Lee...

257
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:05,000
That's on me, forever.

258
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:10,583
If I tell Sam
to save Lee...

259
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:13,041
He'll always be out there.
Charlotte, wait.

260
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,333
Either way, Coop,
I lose.

261
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:23,041
Hang a t.P.A. And increase
the oxygen to 100%.

262
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,041
Susan.

263
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:28,709
You said I could go.
You said she'd be all right.

264
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,709
Susan has

265
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,083
a large blood clot
in her lung,

266
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,583
and we're treating it
as aggressively as we can,

267
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:40,375
but she--
well, do whatever you have to.
I want more, much more.

268
00:13:40,417 --> 00:13:42,834
No pulse.

269
00:13:44,834 --> 00:13:47,500
Dr. Montgomery,
should I call the code team?

270
00:13:50,834 --> 00:13:52,834
No.

271
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,041
Why aren't you
doing anything?

272
00:13:57,083 --> 00:14:00,041
Susan signed a d.N.R.
She didn't want me to tell you.

273
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:04,000
I don't care. Save her.
I'm sorry. I can't.

274
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:06,041
You can.

275
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,792
Susan was clear.

276
00:14:07,834 --> 00:14:11,792
Addison! Do something!

277
00:14:11,834 --> 00:14:14,458
Oh!

278
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,959
Come on. Come on.
Bizzy.

279
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,041
Help her!
Bizzy.

280
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:21,792
You can't just stand there
and watch her die!
Bizzy. Bizzy.

281
00:14:21,834 --> 00:14:24,542
You can't...

I wanted that bastard moved

I could put

312
00:16:13,834 --> 00:16:15,542
grab a scalpel...

313
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:19,166
And some hydrogen peroxide.

314
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,875
I wanted him to feel pain...

315
00:16:21,917 --> 00:16:23,333
And fear.

316
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:26,458
And now?

317
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,417
I don't know.

318
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:34,166
Charlotte,
I have to do something

319
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,792
that I don't normally do.

320
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:38,792
I can't be objective here
because it's you

321
00:16:38,834 --> 00:16:41,041
and because I was
a part of this.

322
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,709
And, uh, I'm just gonna
tell you what I think,

323
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,375
and that is that...

324
00:16:45,417 --> 00:16:47,208
You make
life-and-death decisions

325
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,041
for patients every day,
and I see you do it.

326
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:53,041
You're logical and brilliant
and dispassionate,

327
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,583
and... if I ever had
an emergency,

328
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,166
I would want you
to be my doctor.

329
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:00,250
If you saw him on the street,

330
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:03,041
and he tried
to attack you again,

331
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,041
I believe you could kill him.

332
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:08,792
But when he comes into
your hospital needing help,

333
00:17:08,834 --> 00:17:10,834
that's different.

334
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,375
He took a lot from you,
Charlotte.

335
00:17:13,417 --> 00:17:17,041
But you can't let him take
what makes you you.

336
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,375
The shrapnel is...

337
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,542
It's there.

338
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,625
It's amazing.
I'm walking and talking

339
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:30,041
with a piece of metal
in my head.

340
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,041
Can you get to it safely?

341
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:35,041
I can get to it, but it
might be better to leave it.

342
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,625
Why?

343
00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:38,041
The shrapnel is wedged

344
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,083
right up against the bottom
of your optic nerve.

345
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,083
The scar tissue has healed
around it.

346
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:45,041
It's not gonna be easy
to get out, and if I cut

347
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:47,375
or damage the nerve
while I'm in there trying,

348
00:17:47,417 --> 00:17:49,375
you could lose whatever
eyesight you still have left.

349
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:51,417
It could also cause a bleed
in your brain

350
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,417
that would
be difficult to stop.

351
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,792
I want the surgery.

352
00:17:55,834 --> 00:17:57,792
Lizzie...

353
00:17:57,834 --> 00:18:00,750
I talked to Eric's mom,
Janet, and she--

354
00:18:00,792 --> 00:18:03,417
you what?
Sh-she wants to be involved.

355
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:06,417
She wants to help
with you and Natasha.

356
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:09,041
She wants to take Natasha.
She always has.

357
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:11,750
Lizzie,
will you excuse us

358
00:18:11,792 --> 00:18:14,250
for just one minute?

359
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,083
Whose side are you on?

360
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:22,750
The side that says we do
what is best for our patient.

361
00:18:22,792 --> 00:18:25,041
Which is why
you shouldn't have called Janet

362
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:28,875
to take away Lizzie's baby.
Just do the surgery.
It is dangerous,
and there's a better solution.

363
00:18:28,917 --> 00:18:30,875
Lizzie losing Natasha?

364
00:18:30,917 --> 00:18:32,875
She can't see, Pete.
She has no money.

365
00:18:32,917 --> 00:18:35,041
Her entire life is gonna be
an uphill battle,

366
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,041
which means that Natasha's
will be, too.

367
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,625
Look, if Janet wants to help--
Janet is not the patient.

368
00:18:39,667 --> 00:18:41,709
Do the surgery.

369
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,333
Where is he?

370
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,041
Don't do this. Don't--

371
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,375
how's it feel,
you piece of crap, huh...

372
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:56,709
To have someone attack you?!
Cooper, walk away.

373
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,542
You know who I am?!
I am her fiancé!
Cooper.

374
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:02,125
I need 30 seconds alone
in a room with you!
Walk away. Walk away.

375
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:05,125
Let me go! Y-You don't wanna--
you don't wanna--I'll do it.

376
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:08,041
I'll do it.
You want to go in there?
Fine. Go in there. Go.

377
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,041
Kill him.

378
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,542
Why are you helping him?

379
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,792
Why is he still alive?

380
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:21,000
I don't want Charlotte
to fall apart again

381
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,834
right when
she's getting better.

382
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,959
What's going on?

383
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,166
Nothing.

384
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,542
Did you come here to--

385
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:32,333
oh, butt out, Sheldon.
Come on, Cooper.

386
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:35,041
No. You're not part of this.
No, I am very much
a part of this.

387
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:37,834
I had Lee in an interview room
and didn't put it together

388
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:40,583
that he was the one
who hurt Charlotte.

389
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,834
I'm the reason that Charlotte's
I.D. after the second lineup

390
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:45,041
got tossed out. All I did do
is let that animal choke me.

391
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:48,667
And do you know what, Cooper?
You know what's most important?

392
00:19:48,709 --> 00:19:51,834
I consider Charlotte a friend,
and I failed her.

393
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:56,000
I failed my friend. So don't
tell me that I'm not involved.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

394
00:19:59,792 --> 00:20:02,667
I'm sorry.

395
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,959
You've waited this long.

396
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,458
Just let him die. Please.

397
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:39,166
I thought the nurses
were... confused

398
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:42,000
when they said
you were in here.

399
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:47,041
This is what one does
after a death, isn't it--

400
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:52,208
turn to god,
look for solace?

401
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,834
I'm so, so sorry. I...

402
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,875
If there's anything I can do,

403
00:20:57,917 --> 00:21:00,667
if you want
to come stay with me--
you've done enough.

404
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,834
If I could've helped Susan--
you could have.

405
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,750
That's not what she wanted.
The d.N.R.--

406
00:21:06,792 --> 00:21:08,250
enough. It's done.

407
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,959
You know
that I would do anything...

408
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,250
For you, don't...

409
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,959
I'm trying, you know?
I'm--

410
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,709
is this making you
feel better, Addison?

411
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,750
Do you really not understand,

412
00:21:28,792 --> 00:21:31,917
or do you just need to blame
someone for what happened?

413
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:35,834
What difference
does it make, dear?

414
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,667
Charlotte.

415
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:53,709
Cooper's looking for you.

416
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,208
I know.

417
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:01,542
He knocks her around
and god knows what else,

418
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:04,000
yet there she sits,

419
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:06,166
keeping a vigil.

420
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:09,542
When I was a little girl,

421
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:12,792
I used to go to church
every Sunday with my daddy.

422
00:22:12,834 --> 00:22:16,041
I'd sit on his lap
and daydream through most of it,

423
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:19,041
but... what got my attention
week in and week out

424
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:20,917
was the pastor's sermon.

425
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:23,166
Now he'd bang on
about this or that,

426
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:26,375
but it always came back
to one thing...

427
00:22:26,417 --> 00:22:29,166
Good...

428
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:31,125
And evil...

429
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:34,375
How the righteous
need to see evil

430
00:22:34,417 --> 00:22:38,542
and resist it
with everything that they have.

431
00:22:40,417 --> 00:22:42,834
It scared me,

432
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:45,041
but there was something...

433
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:47,041
Comforting about it,

434
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:49,333
about how black-and-white
it seemed.

435
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:50,792
Yeah.

436
00:22:50,834 --> 00:22:53,583
But you get older,
and you realize...

437
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:56,041
It's not black-and-white
at all...

438
00:22:56,083 --> 00:23:01,041
Picking out what's right
from what's wrong...

439
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:03,000
Deciding where to draw
that line.

440
00:23:04,834 --> 00:23:07,583
I understand, Charlotte,

441
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:09,208
I do,

442
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:12,208
you wanting to see him dead
for--for what he did to you.

443
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:15,417
But... I think you need
to ask yourself,

444
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:17,417
if the only way
that can happen

445
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:19,417
is you having a hand in it,

446
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:22,583
is that gonna bring you peace
or... more torment?

447
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:26,375
How am I
supposed to know that?

448
00:23:26,417 --> 00:23:28,375
Well, maybe you can't,
but, uh...

449
00:23:28,417 --> 00:23:31,041
I just...

450
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:33,375
You know that man
who killed Dell

451
00:23:33,417 --> 00:23:36,583
and almost killed Maya
and Olivia?

452
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:38,583
I just had this instinct

453
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,166
that the only way
that I was gonna be able

454
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:44,083
to let go of all the anger
I felt...

455
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:46,041
Was to forgive him.

456
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:50,208
So...

457
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:53,041
The bleeding in Mr. McHenry's
lungs is under control,

458
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:55,291
and his respiratory function
is back to normal.

459
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,917
If he's gonna have any chance,
I can't wait much longer

460
00:23:57,959 --> 00:24:00,125
before removing the knife.

461
00:24:05,792 --> 00:24:08,375
Do it.

462
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:12,291
Are you sure?

463
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:14,625
Do whatever you have to
to save him.

464
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:27,667
You're gonna feel
some pressure.

465
00:24:29,709 --> 00:24:32,041
It feels weird.

466
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:35,375
This is the worst part.

467
00:24:37,166 --> 00:24:41,333
I know you don't think
I'll be a good mother.

468
00:24:45,542 --> 00:24:48,250
Raising a baby...

469
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:50,291
It's hard when you can see.

470
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:54,083
But trying to do it
when you can't, alone...

471
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:57,083
There are plenty of people
out there who can see,

472
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:59,208
and they're still
terrible parents.

473
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:02,000
They ignore their kids.
They mistreat them.

474
00:25:07,959 --> 00:25:10,041
I've had a lot of challenges

475
00:25:10,083 --> 00:25:12,041
in my life already,
Dr. Shepherd.

476
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:13,917
Mostly ones I didn't want.

477
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:16,041
But now, having Natasha,

478
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:20,917
she is more important to me
than anything.

479
00:25:20,959 --> 00:25:25,250
And I promise you,
I will make it work.

480
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:29,500
Whatever it takes,
I will make it work.

481
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,041
I'm not crazy.

482
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:43,041
No one said you were.

483
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,625
And everything you're feeling
is justified--

484
00:25:45,667 --> 00:25:48,458
the anger and the frustration--
but you can't act on it.

485
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,458
That's the difference
between you and Lee--

486
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:54,041
the capacity to control
your emotions.
It's easy to say that
in the abstract.

487
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:57,000
But to see that man and know
what he did to Charlotte...

488
00:25:57,041 --> 00:25:59,500
You're wrong.
I know what you're thinking.

489
00:25:59,542 --> 00:26:03,041
I know it feels right,
but you're wrong.

490
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:04,083
Sam.

491
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:06,667
Please.
Charlotte asked me
to save him.

492
00:26:06,709 --> 00:26:08,792
And I'm asking you not to.

493
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:11,041
He'll do it again.
The D.A. won't prosecute him.

494
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:14,083
Cooper--
I'm not saying
don't go in there.

495
00:26:14,125 --> 00:26:17,083
I'm saying you don't have to
let him come out.
Do you think that it
makes me happy

496
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:20,417
to have to go in there
and try to save that guy?

497
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:22,417
Do you? We took an oath.

498
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:26,041
Screw the oath. He raped
Charlotte. He raped her.

499
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:29,458
And he deserves so much worse
than anything you or I

500
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,417
could ever do.

501
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:35,625
If we cross that line--
if there was ever a time,
it's now.

502
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:38,125
Then what, Cooper?
Where does it stop?

503
00:26:38,166 --> 00:26:40,250
Look, I-I know that you
can rationalize this

504
00:26:40,291 --> 00:26:44,041
just like I have, Addison,
Pete, the entire practice.

505
00:26:44,083 --> 00:26:46,083
But at the end of the day,

506
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:49,041
all the rationalization doesn't
make what we're doing right.

507
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:51,542
It's wrong.

508
00:26:51,583 --> 00:26:53,875
To let a man die,
no matter how bad he is,

509
00:26:53,917 --> 00:26:56,000
it's wrong.

510
00:26:59,083 --> 00:27:01,542
You're right, Sam. This...

511
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:04,000
This is what we do.

512
00:27:14,208 --> 00:27:17,291
How's bizzy holding up?

513
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:19,500
No way to tell.

514
00:27:19,542 --> 00:27:21,792
And you?

515
00:27:21,834 --> 00:27:24,291
I am...

516
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:27,041
I am not...

517
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:28,667
Holding up.

518
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:35,041
You did...
The right thing, Addison.

519
00:27:35,083 --> 00:27:37,291
Then why doesn't it
feel that way?

520
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:40,291
Well, I haven't known
your mother very long,

521
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:43,834
but she seems like
a hard woman to please.

522
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:46,000
Impossible.

523
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:48,291
Then why do you keep trying?

524
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,500
Because she's my mother.

525
00:27:51,542 --> 00:27:53,041
And I guess...

526
00:27:53,083 --> 00:27:55,041
Somewhere deep down,

527
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:59,000
there's that instinct
to please...

528
00:27:59,041 --> 00:28:01,417
The idea that...

529
00:28:01,458 --> 00:28:03,333
You'll get something back.

530
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:06,083
I can't let that go.

531
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:07,917
Is that crazy?

532
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:10,625
No.

533
00:28:10,667 --> 00:28:12,709
That's love.

534
00:28:16,834 --> 00:28:18,208
Okay, let's go.

535
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:21,917
Wait.

536
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:35,166
I just wanted to make sure,

537
00:28:35,208 --> 00:28:37,041
if you don't make it,

538
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:38,875
the last image you have

539
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:41,208
was of me.

540
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:04,291
Hi.

541
00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:06,041
Sorry. I'm...

542
00:29:06,083 --> 00:29:08,041
My name's Nancy.

543
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:10,375
I know who you are.

544
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:12,834
Look, I-I don't want
to bother you, but...

545
00:29:14,625 --> 00:29:16,667
Is he gonna be okay?

546
00:29:16,709 --> 00:29:18,667
I don't know.

547
00:29:18,709 --> 00:29:21,041
But this doctor
working on him, is he good?

548
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:23,000
He's the best.

549
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:29,417
Is this...

550
00:29:29,458 --> 00:29:31,959
Is this where it happened?

551
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,083
You know
what he did to me?

552
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:36,792
Lee told me.

553
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:43,000
This is where it happened.

554
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,583
I'm sorry.

555
00:29:50,083 --> 00:29:52,792
What exactly
are you sorry for,

556
00:29:52,834 --> 00:29:55,333
that your boyfriend
raped me...

557
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:57,959
That you're too weak
to leave him...

558
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,583
That the male role model
in your son's life

559
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:03,959
is a violent predator?

560
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,166
What?

561
00:30:05,208 --> 00:30:07,792
I'm sorry.

562
00:30:07,834 --> 00:30:10,250
I am.

563
00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:12,291
But I love him.

564
00:30:13,834 --> 00:30:15,792
Do you know
how horrible it is

565
00:30:15,834 --> 00:30:17,709
to love someone like this?

566
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:20,041
No.

567
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:22,125
With me...

568
00:30:22,166 --> 00:30:25,041
With our boy...

569
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:28,625
Lee can be gentle and sweet
when he wants to be.

570
00:30:28,667 --> 00:30:30,959
That doesn't make it okay.

571
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,959
You can kid yourself, Nancy.

572
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,792
But you and Lee,

573
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:36,959
it's gonna end badly.

574
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,333
So the way I see it,
you got two choices.

575
00:30:40,375 --> 00:30:43,500
You could try to put him
in the ground again,

576
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:45,333
which is what he deserves.

577
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:49,583
But given what that would mean
for you and your boy...

578
00:30:49,625 --> 00:30:51,667
You have to run.

579
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:56,000
Take your boy and run.

580
00:31:05,375 --> 00:31:08,792
Will we know right away?

581
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:10,875
As soon as the bandages
come off.

582
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,166
Take your time.

583
00:31:19,208 --> 00:31:22,375
Just open your eyes, slowly.

584
00:31:32,917 --> 00:31:35,208
What do you see?

585
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:39,875
Gray...

586
00:31:39,917 --> 00:31:41,250
Walls.

587
00:31:45,834 --> 00:31:47,917
And yellow curtains.

588
00:31:47,959 --> 00:31:51,041
I--the room.
I see everything.

589
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:53,041
Your turquoise scrub cap.

590
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:57,250
Congratulations.

591
00:31:57,291 --> 00:31:59,041
And thank you.

592
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:03,417
You're a miracle worker,
Dr. Shepherd.

593
00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:07,458
I'm happy for you, Lizzie,

594
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,709
and Natasha.

595
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:13,083
Excuse me.

596
00:32:13,125 --> 00:32:16,041
Janet, wait.
Oh.

597
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,333
Janet, wait.

598
00:32:19,375 --> 00:32:21,333
I'm sorry.

599
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:23,333
You--you must think
I'm a terrible person,

600
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:26,041
crying because Lizzie got
her eyesight back.

601
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:27,625
No, I don't think that.

602
00:32:27,667 --> 00:32:30,834
It wasn't
supposed to be like this.

603
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:33,417
Eric was
supposed to come home.

604
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:38,291
Then he would fall in love,
and I'd gain a daughter...

605
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:41,792
And... we'd dance
at the--at the wedding,

606
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:45,500
and... then there'd be
grand--

607
00:32:45,542 --> 00:32:48,709
there'd be grandchildren,

608
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:52,125
and I'd be there for them.

609
00:32:52,166 --> 00:32:56,000
It wasn't supposed to be
like this.

610
00:33:00,875 --> 00:33:02,291
She's devastated.

611
00:33:02,333 --> 00:33:05,542
Imagine how upset
she would be

612
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:08,250
if she knew
that you lied to her.

613
00:33:08,291 --> 00:33:10,917
My turquoise scrub cap?
Really?

614
00:33:10,959 --> 00:33:12,375
When the bandage came off,

615
00:33:12,417 --> 00:33:14,792
her pupil did not react
to the bright lights.

616
00:33:14,834 --> 00:33:16,333
The surgery didn't work,
Pete.

617
00:33:16,375 --> 00:33:18,166
I mean,
she's totally blind now.

618
00:33:18,208 --> 00:33:22,166
You coached her to fool Janet.
She can't fool me.

619
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:25,125
I'm sorry. I... I really was
hoping the surgery would work.

620
00:33:25,166 --> 00:33:26,750
But if it didn't,

621
00:33:26,792 --> 00:33:29,000
the only way to keep
Lizzie and Natasha together

622
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:31,041
was to convince Janet
she could see again.

623
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:33,041
And you think
that makes it okay?

624
00:33:33,083 --> 00:33:35,333
Where is the freakin' line
with you people?

625
00:33:35,375 --> 00:33:38,000
Seriously, Pete.

626
00:33:40,417 --> 00:33:42,792
I won't lie for her.

627
00:33:42,834 --> 00:33:44,917
You shouldn't either.

628
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:19,041
Wh-why am i--

629
00:34:19,083 --> 00:34:21,667
your girlfriend
called the police.

630
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:26,041
Told 'em you admitted
to raping me.

631
00:34:26,083 --> 00:34:29,041
Are you--
gonna hurt you?

632
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:32,208
If I wanted you dead,
you'd be gone by now.

633
00:34:34,208 --> 00:34:36,709
I spent all this time

634
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:41,083
building you up in my head
as some big bad monster.

635
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:43,834
The truth is,
you're nothing.

636
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:45,250
Nothing...

637
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:48,041
But a sad,
pathetic little man

638
00:34:48,083 --> 00:34:50,625
who has to beat
and rape women

639
00:34:50,667 --> 00:34:52,875
to make himself feel big.

640
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
You got no power over me.

641
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:03,041
I am not afraid of you.

642
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:05,458
But I do pity you.

643
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,959
I don't need your pity.

644
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,875
Yes, you do.

645
00:35:14,917 --> 00:35:17,125
