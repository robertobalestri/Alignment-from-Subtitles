♪ Ohhh ohhh ohhh ♪

2
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:09,625
Nurse:
Welcome back, Dr. King.

3
00:00:09,667 --> 00:00:11,000
Thank you.

4
00:00:44,917 --> 00:00:46,583
You're staring at me again.

5
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:47,875
No, I'm not.

6
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:53,583
Okay, I am.

7
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:57,542
You ready to talk about it now?

8
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:01,041
I can't.

9
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:03,709
You can tell me.

10
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,250
Whatever it is.

11
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:06,750
I can keep a secret.

12
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:11,375
Stop staring at me.

13
00:01:11,417 --> 00:01:13,417
You were staring at me first.

14
00:01:14,667 --> 00:01:15,959
You wanna play doctor?

15
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:20,709
I can be the doctor
and you can be the patient.

16
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:24,500
Doctor-patient confidentiality.

17
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:25,542
Oh.

18
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:31,959
No. No.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
No, I can't talk about it.

20
00:01:40,917 --> 00:01:42,709
Has anyone talked to Charlotte?

21
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,083
I left her a couple messages,

22
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:45,667
but she-- she didn't call
me back.

23
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:46,917
What do we say?

24
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:48,417
Sam:
"Get well" or "sorry this
happened"

25
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:49,625
both seem pretty ridiculous.

26
00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:51,250
Amelia:
Is there a card that says:

27
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:54,041
"I'm sorry you got viciously
beaten and robbed"?

28
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:56,291
You need to learn to filter
before you speak.

29
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:57,333
You must have talked to her.

30
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:58,542
I sent flowers.

31
00:01:58,583 --> 00:01:59,542
Oh, flowers. Crap.

32
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:01,041
I should have sent her flowers.

33
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:04,041
Hey. Charlotte went
to the hospital first,

34
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:05,542
but now she's parking
downstairs,

35
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:06,667
so I need-- I need, uh...

36
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,000
You need to go to the gym.

37
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:11,542
Shut up.
She's gonna be here any second.

38
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:12,667
Just don't act weird.

39
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:14,041
You're setting a great example.

40
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:16,041
Just tell her she looks great.
Does she?

41
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:18,041
No. She looks like she got
the crap kicked out of her.

42
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:19,542
But-- shh. Ahem.

43
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:22,792
Good morning.
Sam &amp; Amelia: Morning.

44
00:02:26,917 --> 00:02:29,542
Take a good look,
then get over it.

45
00:02:38,542 --> 00:02:40,959
If you're gonna be all nervous
and annoying around me,

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,792
just stay the hell
out of my way.

47
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,375
What did I say?

48
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:49,542
I said don't act weird

49
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,083
and you all acted weird.

50
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:53,041
Like weird people.

51
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,500
Well, I thought it went about
as well as could be expected.

52
00:02:58,542 --> 00:03:01,041
I think it's too soon
for her to be back.

53
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:02,834
Well, look, I mean,
she faced everybody.

54
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,709
Clearly stated her needs.
She told us off.

55
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,959
Therapeutically speaking,
that's a good day's work.

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,083
Violet's right.

57
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,542
Either you get swallowed up
by that kind of trauma

58
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:13,417
or you try to regain
control of your life.

59
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,500
Charlotte's regaining control.

60
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,667
I just got your page.

61
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:23,542
Elisa, it's gonna be okay.

62
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:26,041
All right, you're gonna feel
a little pinch.

63
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,583
I'm in.

64
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,625
Now we just have
to drain the fluid.

65
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:40,792
Thank you, Dr. Wilder.

66
00:03:40,834 --> 00:03:42,375
Pete:
No problem.

67
00:03:42,417 --> 00:03:44,291
You did great.

68
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,834
Papi, I'm okay. Really.

69
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:50,166
She isn't, is she?
Her cancer's back.

70
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,166
I'm sorry.
I think the lymphoma tissue

71
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,583
has seeded the pericardium.

72
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,041
We'll have to confirm
with the ct.

73
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,625
Please don't worry, papi.

74
00:03:57,667 --> 00:03:59,041
Diego:
Her body can't take more chemo.

75
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,041
The last two times,
she lost all her hair.

76
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,834
Her mouth and tongue
were covered in ulcers.

77
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,041
I can try something different
to treat the side effects.

78
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,458
Diego, we've talked about this.

79
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,625
Even after a relapse,

80
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:09,458
Elisa's type of lymphoma
is curable.

81
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,083
I believe that.
But not with western medicine.

82
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:16,041
Chemotherapy is the way
to fight this.

83
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,750
There's another way.

84
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,500
I'm taking Elisa to a shaman.

85
00:04:36,917 --> 00:04:38,333
Oh, hey.

86
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:41,667
I was thinking about getting
a latte and then, uh,

87
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:43,709
you know, I thought of you,
so I went to your office,

88
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,917
but you weren't there

89
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:47,041
and I thought I'd check
downstairs and--

90
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,458
you sound like a stalker.

91
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,500
I don't. But...

92
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:55,041
Okay, I kind of do.
But, uh, coffee?

93
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,709
No, thanks.

94
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,875
Tea, then?

95
00:04:59,917 --> 00:05:04,041
Or we could get one of those
iced, fruity-ccino things.

96
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,000
We're not friends.

97
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,375
You need another pelvic exam

98
00:05:20,417 --> 00:05:21,959
to make sure
you're healing properly.

99
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,166
Not to mention follow-up labs,
continued HIV drugs.

100
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,417
I'll take care of that myself.

101
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,000
Charlotte, you...

102
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:31,125
All right,
we're not friends.

103
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:33,041
But we could be.

104
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,166
I could be your friend.

105
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm the only one
who knows what happened,

106
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,542
and I could,
I don't know,

107
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,709
be there
for you or whatever.

108
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,458
I only need one thing from you.

109
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,709
Anything. Name it.

110
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,000
Keep your damn trap shut
about what happened.

111
00:05:56,417 --> 00:05:58,041
His daughter has been
through chemo twice

112
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,417
and her cancer is back.

113
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,417
You can't blame Diego
for wanting to try something.

114
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,375
Consulting a witch doctor
instead of an oncologist

115
00:06:03,417 --> 00:06:04,667
borders on child abuse.

116
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:05,875
Shamans have been healing people

117
00:06:05,917 --> 00:06:07,041
for thousands of years, Cooper.

118
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,625
So even if you
don't believe in it--

119
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:09,750
Elisa's mother didn't.

120
00:06:09,792 --> 00:06:11,667
This would not be an issue
if Alice were alive.

121
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:12,875
She would never
let a medicine man

122
00:06:12,917 --> 00:06:14,542
try to clear the trauma
in Elisa's soul

123
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,250
to restore the balance in her
body, because it's crap.

124
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,041
You know as well as I do
that a person's faith

125
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,583
plays a huge role
in their recovery.

126
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,542
So if Elisa and Diego believe
a shaman can help,

127
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:23,583
then she can.

128
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,000
She is sick, Pete.
She needs real help.

129
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,041
She does need help.

130
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,667
And if you wanna
be a part of it, open your mind.

131
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,667
With all my health problems,

132
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:36,792
I feel like I've robbed
you of your youth.

133
00:06:36,834 --> 00:06:39,834
Heh. My youth was spent
just fine.

134
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,041
Every week, we come in here,

135
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,875
and all I can think about is,
it's not fair.

136
00:06:44,917 --> 00:06:46,667
I mean, first
it was my diabetes.

137
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:48,625
You had that long
before I met you.

138
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:51,083
Doesn't count.
And then the breast cancer.

139
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,834
Which we beat together.

140
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,041
Taking care of me is exhausting.

141
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,667
I see it in you.

142
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:01,875
And sometimes I'm afraid
you'll start to resent me.

143
00:07:01,917 --> 00:07:03,041
Oh, that's crazy.

144
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,500
No, wait, Nick.
Let's talk about that.

145
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,667
How do you relieve the stress

146
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:10,417
that her illness
puts on your marriage?

147
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,875
Do you exercise?
Do you drink?

148
00:07:12,917 --> 00:07:15,709
Not for years. On either count.

149
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:17,709
You fight?

150
00:07:23,667 --> 00:07:25,709
We fight, sure.

151
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,667
Every couple does.
That's true.

152
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:30,667
So why is it making you
so uncomfortable?

153
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,709
She doesn't mean to, but--
Nick!

154
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm sorry.
My last patient was, uh...

155
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:43,000
I've got some more right here.

156
00:07:46,792 --> 00:07:47,792
It's okay, honey.

157
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:49,875
I don't wanna talk about it.

158
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,250
Rachel.
Rachel: Unh.

159
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:53,500
Rachel!

160
00:07:58,834 --> 00:08:00,375
She doesn't mean to.

161
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:09,417
Rachel?
"Rachel and Nick" Rachel?

162
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,125
She's been with him
for 20 years.

163
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:12,709
I mean, people get
upset in therapy.

164
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,709
No, this was not
an emotional outburst.

165
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,500
Okay, it was
an adrenaline surge.

166
00:08:17,542 --> 00:08:19,834
It was the kind of rage
you see from an addict.

167
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:20,834
Is she taking drugs?

168
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,709
Yes, but not the kind you think.

169
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:23,917
We're managing her diabetes

170
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,500
and the kidney problems
that causes,

171
00:08:25,542 --> 00:08:26,709
but she's not a junkie.

172
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,625
In fact, she's the most
resilient woman I know.

173
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:31,750
She never complains about
her health, never stops trying.

174
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:33,041
Well-- no, she's incredible.

175
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:34,625
She's abusive.

176
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:37,000
Sheldon, come on.
She was a ballerina

177
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:39,542
and Nick looks like
a lumberjack.

178
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,709
Really, I mean, how badly
can she really hurt him?

179
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,041
Abuse is abuse.

180
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,792
Would we be having
this conversation

181
00:08:44,834 --> 00:08:46,583
if Rachel were the one being hit
instead of Nick?

182
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,000
Sheldon.
I'm serious.

183
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,041
Would you tell a woman to stay
with an abusive spouse?

184
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,834
No. But this is...
Okay, this feels different.

185
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:55,333
Rachel and Nick
are not a cautionary tale,

186
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:56,542
they're a love story.

187
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,417
You ever heard
of Judith and holofernes?

188
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,041
Famous love story.

189
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,375
Ends with Judith chopping
off the head of her beloved.

190
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:03,792
You know, Florence,
great paintings

191
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:06,625
by rubens and Rembrandt.
You should see them.

192
00:09:08,917 --> 00:09:10,750
What?
Nothing. You're just

193
00:09:10,792 --> 00:09:14,083
a little odd and pretentious.

194
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:16,792
But I'm not wrong.

195
00:09:16,834 --> 00:09:18,333
Something's going
on with Rachel.

196
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,041
What's wrong, Coop?

197
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,500
Shamans.

198
00:09:26,542 --> 00:09:27,583
Shamans.

199
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,000
And Charlotte.

200
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:30,000
Shamans and Charlotte?

201
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:33,583
No, no, no. Mostly Charlotte.

202
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:36,041
She's having nightmares,
she wakes up screaming.

203
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,041
I try to get her to eat,
she says she's not hungry.

204
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,709
I try to talk about
the police investigation,

205
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,625
she just shuts me down.

206
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:44,917
Well, she's trying
to put herself back together

207
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,083
in her own way, Coop.

208
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,500
There's no blueprint
for any of this.

209
00:09:47,542 --> 00:09:49,041
Yeah, no, i-- I-I know that.

210
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:50,542
Everyone handles
trauma differently.

211
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:51,875
It takes time to heal.

212
00:09:51,917 --> 00:09:53,834
You gotta put one foot
in front of blah, blah, blah.

213
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:56,750
Glad to see you hold the tools
of my profession in high regard.

214
00:09:56,792 --> 00:09:58,041
Well, none of that helps me,
Violet.

215
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,667
Well, it's not about you,
Cooper.

216
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:01,625
It's about Charlotte.

217
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:02,750
So you're saying...

218
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,709
Back off.

219
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,625
You're a bad shrink.

220
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:08,041
Can I hide out here for a while?

221
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,542
Yeah. As long as you want.

222
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:18,375
I have to report
the abuse, Nick.

223
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,667
If you say anything,
I'll deny it.

224
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:24,583
She's hitting you.

225
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,667
Most of the time she's fine.

226
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,500
And when she's not,
I can handle her.

227
00:10:28,542 --> 00:10:31,709
For now.
But what I saw, it...

228
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,750
She could hurt you.

229
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,875
Are you married, Dr. Wallace?

230
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:39,667
No.

231
00:10:39,709 --> 00:10:42,917
Then with all due respect,
you can't understand.

232
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,083
I met her right out
of journalism school.

233
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,667
I was a reporter for the times,

234
00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:53,291
got tagged to cover
a performance of swan lake.

235
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:56,333
What the hell did I know
about ballet, right?

236
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,041
But when I saw her dance,

237
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:02,750
I don't know,
she was just mesmerizing.

238
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:05,000
She has this quality like

239
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:08,000
when you're with her,
nothing else matters.

240
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,750
I won't give up on her.

241
00:11:11,792 --> 00:11:12,959
Not ever.

242
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,041
Who sent you to spy on me?

243
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:28,000
Cooper? Addison?

244
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,542
I came looking
for you on my own.

245
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,166
I figured your day
was probably pretty weird

246
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:34,375
and you might need some
sugary, deep-fried batter.

247
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:39,458
So are you--?

248
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,041
If you ask me if I'm okay,
I swear to god

249
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,041
I'll take this cast
and knock you upside the head.

250
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,500
I wasn't gonna ask you that.

251
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:52,542
When I first kicked drugs,
I took up running.

252
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:55,792
I mean, an addict's gotta be
addicted to something, right?

253
00:11:55,834 --> 00:11:57,458
So I would get up
when it was still dark

254
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,834
and I would go for miles.

255
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,875
Until the morning
I got clipped by a minivan.

256
00:12:03,917 --> 00:12:07,041
I didn't get anything like
the injuries that you have,

257
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:09,625
but I started
craving pills again.

258
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:16,458
So I was thinking that maybe
you were craving pills again.

259
00:12:20,417 --> 00:12:22,083
I took your advice
and I'm back at meetings.

260
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,083
And if you wanna go--

261
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,667
I grew up wrestling
two brothers.

262
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:27,667
I have an incredibly
high pain threshold.

263
00:12:28,709 --> 00:12:30,500
Anything else?

264
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,709
Can--? Can you hold that?

265
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,750
Hey.
Hey.

266
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:42,500
I got Nick to agree
to bring Rachel in.

267
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:43,500
Would you check her out?

268
00:12:43,542 --> 00:12:45,291
Of course.

269
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,959
Okay.

270
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:50,709
Sheldon.

271
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,041
It's been a while since
we've discussed man troubles

272
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,750
and I was beginning to think

273
00:12:54,792 --> 00:12:56,041
you'd found another therapist.

274
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:59,458
Oh. No, I wanna talk
about Charlotte.

275
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,041
Do you think she's okay?

276
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,959
Because I don't,
but she won't listen to me.

277
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,333
I didn't realize
you two were close.

278
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:07,041
Well, we're not, exactly,

279
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,792
but I was there that night

280
00:13:09,917 --> 00:13:11,291
and it was horrific.

281
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,667
If it was Nai or Amelia,
I'd know what to do.

282
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:16,250
But because it's Charlotte--
she's just not interested.

283
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:18,083
It's because you were
there that night.

284
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:19,291
No, she wanted me there.

285
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,917
No, at the time, yes.

286
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,291
But you saw her when she was
in her most fragile state.

287
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,375
Which means you're the living,

288
00:13:25,417 --> 00:13:27,542
breathing reminder
of what happened.

289
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:30,500
When she sees you,
she's that victim again.

290
00:13:31,542 --> 00:13:33,041
I just wanna help.

291
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:37,000
Well, then, you'll need to find
a more indirect way to do it.

292
00:13:38,709 --> 00:13:39,750
Um...

293
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:06,750
Hi.

294
00:14:06,792 --> 00:14:09,041
Thank you for allowing
us to observe.

295
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,375
I brought something for Elisa.

296
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,041
The medicine men
I've worked with

297
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,041
say that quartz
is a very powerful healer.

298
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,041
So you understand my beliefs?

299
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:18,834
Pete:
I worked with a shaman
in the Congo

300
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,041
to treat an outbreak of measles.

301
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,333
And you think it was the shaman
that cured those people

302
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:23,583
and not the vaccinations?

303
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,041
Maybe it was one thing,
maybe it was both.

304
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:28,166
Either way, people got better.

305
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,041
Diego:
I know you think
I'm crazy, Dr. Freedman.

306
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:34,041
But my only concern
is that Elisa get well.

307
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,583
We tried western medicine.
It failed.

308
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:37,542
It kept her alive.

309
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:38,750
It killed my wife.

310
00:14:38,792 --> 00:14:41,583
Alice died of an aneurysm
that ruptured.

311
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:42,750
Nobody could have saved her.

312
00:14:42,792 --> 00:14:44,333
And Elisa,
she can still be saved.

313
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:48,667
Papi, is she okay?

314
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:50,041
Elisa?

315
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:53,166
Pete: Elisa?
Cooper: She needs help.

316
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:54,458
She's getting help.

317
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,041
It's just the bad energy
leaving her body.

318
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm not getting a pulse.
Diego: Leave her alone.

319
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,583
Pete: I'm calling an ambulance.
Stop it. Let the shaman finish.

320
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:03,417
Cooper:
Elisa, stay with me now.
Come on.

321
00:15:20,542 --> 00:15:22,041
Is Elisa okay?
Yes.

322
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,709
She was in hypotensive shock

323
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,041
by the time
the ambulance got here,

324
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,500
so she needed surgery
to make a small incision

325
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:28,709
in the sac around the heart

326
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,542
to drain the fluid.
She's in recovery now.

327
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,041
Can she come home?

328
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,834
She's gonna have to stay
here for a few more days.

329
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,625
Cooper:
I'd like to keep her under
observation

330
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:36,917
while we start chemo.

331
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,667
You brought Elisa here
against my wishes.

332
00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:39,917
I want her discharged.

333
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:41,041
Pete:
No, she can't go anyplace

334
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,542
until the surgical
drain's removed.

335
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,041
Do you understand what's
happening?

336
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,041
She has a tube draining fluid
out of her heart

337
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,458
and she has a tumor
that's getting larger every day,

338
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,041
and no shaman can stop that.

339
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,917
Elisa is my daughter
and I will decide

340
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:53,333
what medical treatment she--

341
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,458
not if you're incapable of
making a responsible decision.

342
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,208
Alternative therapies work,
Cooper.

343
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,583
I've seen patients cured.

344
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,750
With the right combination
of homeopathic remedies,

345
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:02,750
Elisa can get the kind
of treatment Diego wants.

346
00:16:02,792 --> 00:16:04,166
Cooper:
Enough. I'm sorry.

347
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,750
I don't care what Diego wants.

348
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:08,041
I'm getting a judge
to order Elisa's chemo.

349
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,166
No, you can't do that.

350
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,458
Yes, I can.

351
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,583
And I will.

352
00:16:28,792 --> 00:16:30,500
Sam, I have to tell you
something.

353
00:16:30,542 --> 00:16:32,709
Right now?

354
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,041
Do you wanna know my secret

355
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:35,542
or do you wanna have
sex with me?

356
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:39,000
Well, both would be good. Right?

357
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:52,000
I did something the other night.

358
00:16:53,834 --> 00:16:55,792
A rape kit.

359
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:00,041
Okay, we really need to work
on your pillow talk.

360
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,750
Technically, it was just some
washings, but see the thing is

361
00:17:02,792 --> 00:17:06,041
that the victim didn't want it.

362
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,125
Wait, what?

363
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,542
She was upset

364
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:11,208
and I thought she might
want the DNA later,

365
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,750
so I went ahead
and did it anyway,

366
00:17:12,792 --> 00:17:14,041
but then I didn't tell her.

367
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,542
And then I labeled it Jane Doe

368
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:18,917
and I locked it in the hospital
refrigerator, but...

369
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,375
But I didn't report it.

370
00:17:21,417 --> 00:17:24,000
Well, that's illegal.
Why wouldn't you--?

371
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,000
Because Charlotte
made you promise.

372
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:48,875
You're staring at me.

373
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:54,709
I'm sorry.

374
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,417
And yet you're still
staring at me.

375
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,041
Oh.

376
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,542
It's what we do. The addisam.

377
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,041
We, uh-- we do that.

378
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,792
Oh, god, I'm starting to sound
like her, aren't I?

379
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,792
Ahh. Oh, brother.

380
00:18:06,834 --> 00:18:07,834
Okay.

381
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,000
Okay. Um, ahem.

382
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,834
I have a thing

383
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:17,000
that I can't tell you.
Or anyone.

384
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:21,000
So I'm not gonna tell you.

385
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:26,041
But I need for you to get
what I'm saying.

386
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:31,500
What, did I black out
for a minute?

387
00:18:31,542 --> 00:18:33,208
Because you are not
making any sense.

388
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,542
Okay, uh... talk to Charlotte.

389
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,417
She wants to be left alone.

390
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:41,041
Well, since when has that
ever stopped you?

391
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,917
I mean, let's face it, Violet,
you're kind of nosy.

392
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:47,041
I am not.
I'm-- I'm interested.

393
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:50,041
Okay. Talk to Charlotte.

394
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,959
She needs help.

395
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,709
And you are a shrink.

396
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:57,792
So do what shrinks do.

397
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,667
I saw Elisa this morning.

398
00:19:08,709 --> 00:19:11,500
She's hanging in there.

399
00:19:11,542 --> 00:19:13,041
No thanks to her
crazy-ass father.

400
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,250
You think taking him to court
is the right thing to do?

401
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,083
I had to. He was threatening
to take her home.

402
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,500
If Diego tells the judge

403
00:19:18,542 --> 00:19:21,041
he's refusing treatment on
religious grounds, you'll lose.

404
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,291
Not necessarily.

405
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,291
The California supreme court
prosecuted a mother

406
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,542
whose child died of meningitis.

407
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,625
She'd refused life-saving
medical treatment

408
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,083
in favor of divine healing.

409
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:33,041
Look, I get that you're worried
about Elisa.

410
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,917
I am too.

411
00:19:34,959 --> 00:19:37,500
But you're not gonna help her
by tearing her family apart.

412
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:39,583
If Diego won't look out for his
daughter's best interests,

413
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,375
I will.

414
00:19:41,417 --> 00:19:43,375
I don't know what I would do
if she was my kid.

415
00:19:43,417 --> 00:19:46,291
But Elisa and Diego have a right
to follow their beliefs.

416
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:49,709
They're not crazy, Cooper.
They're just different.

417
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,375
And if you take them
to court to force chemo,

418
00:19:54,667 --> 00:19:56,583
I'll testify on their behalf.

419
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,834
He never complains.

420
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,625
His only concern
is that I'll get hurt.

421
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:08,041
I don't mean to get so angry,

422
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,583
I just can't control myself.

423
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:15,041
Okay, enough whining.
What do you think is going on?

424
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:18,166
Well, there's nothing
on the head mri or chest ct.

425
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:21,041
But I did find a high level
of testosterone in your blood

426
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:24,625
which could be caused by a tumor
of the adrenal glands or lungs,

427
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:26,709
but I ruled that out.
That's good news.

428
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,542
Or by metastatic breast cancer.

429
00:20:29,917 --> 00:20:34,041
But I had a mastectomy
ten years ago.

430
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,709
I know. But sometimes breast
cancer cells get left behind

431
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,000
and grow somewhere else.

432
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,041
That could be a tumor
on your ovary.

433
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,458
And if it's secreting
testosterone,

434
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,667
that buildup
could cause sudden rages.

435
00:20:44,709 --> 00:20:46,083
Are you sure?

436
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:48,166
The only way to know for sure

437
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,709
would be to go in
and take a look.

438
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,458
But surgery is a big gamble
for someone in your health.

439
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,041
I don't care.
I wanna do it for Nick.

440
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:57,875
Please, Dr. Montgomery.

441
00:20:57,917 --> 00:21:00,125
I-- I can't hurt
my husband anymore.

442
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,500
You got a minute?

443
00:21:09,542 --> 00:21:12,041
What for?
It's been a few days.

444
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,667
I should take a look
at your injuries.

445
00:21:14,709 --> 00:21:15,959
They're fine.

446
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,917
Then this will be fast.

447
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:20,750
We can do it here
or we can go to an exam room.

448
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:24,875
Let's just get this over with.

449
00:21:39,792 --> 00:21:41,750
Everything is healing
up beautifully.

450
00:21:41,792 --> 00:21:43,000
I told you.

451
00:21:45,542 --> 00:21:47,166
Okay. Let's take
a look at your back.

452
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:56,583
Oh, here, I got it. I got it.

453
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:09,542
Hmm.

454
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:12,583
Cooper did a crap job
changing this bandage.

455
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,041
He didn't do it.

456
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,750
I did.

457
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:48,500
I got it.

458
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:58,500
When it needs to be changed
again, let me know.

459
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:22,709
Hey. Sorry I had to run out
so early this morning.

460
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,041
You wanna have lunch?

461
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:25,583
What is it with you people
and food?

462
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:27,583
I don't want coffee
or tea or donuts.

463
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:29,083
Can't you just leave me alone?

464
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:31,458
I was just trying
to be thoughtful.

465
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,583
No, you came in here
to check on me.

466
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:36,041
I want you to stop hovering.
I'm not hovering.

467
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:38,250
All I need is for you
and everybody else to back off.

468
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:41,000
Okay, I'm not everybody,
I'm your fiancé.

469
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,667
I'm in this with you.

470
00:23:43,709 --> 00:23:45,834
You are not inside this, Cooper.

471
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:47,333
You have no idea.

472
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:49,959
And now the way
you're looking at me.

473
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,542
Just stop.

474
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:54,041
I can't take it.
I can't breathe.

475
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:55,667
Charlotte.

476
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:05,417
Dr. Montgomery will remove
Rachel's tumor,

477
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:06,625
then stage it to determine

478
00:24:06,667 --> 00:24:08,041
the necessary postoperative
treatment.

479
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:09,458
And if all goes well,

480
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,500
Rachel's testosterone
levels will decrease

481
00:24:11,542 --> 00:24:13,458
and she'll have more control
over her anger.

482
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,667
Good. That's good.

483
00:24:15,709 --> 00:24:17,041
But if the surgery
isn't successful

484
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:18,875
and Rachel's rages continue--

485
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:20,083
we'll get through it.

486
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:27,333
The love you and Rachel have
for each other, it's a gift.

487
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:29,750
Under normal circumstances,
I would work

488
00:24:29,792 --> 00:24:32,542
to keep this marriage healthy
another 50 years.

489
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:34,625
But sometimes--

490
00:24:37,834 --> 00:24:40,709
sometimes I have to counsel
people to walk away.

491
00:24:41,959 --> 00:24:44,500
No one stays together anymore.

492
00:24:44,542 --> 00:24:47,959
They just have a fight,
get a divorce,

493
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,875
pretend like
it never happened.

494
00:24:49,917 --> 00:24:53,291
When instead, they should
be fighting for each other

495
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:55,583
through whatever comes.

496
00:24:55,625 --> 00:24:58,125
This is what love
is supposed to be.

497
00:24:58,166 --> 00:25:01,375
I'm never walking away.

498
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:09,083
Hey, Elisa. How you feeling?

499
00:25:09,125 --> 00:25:11,625
Much, much better.

500
00:25:11,667 --> 00:25:12,542
I'm ready to go home now.

501
00:25:12,583 --> 00:25:14,667
You need to heal
a bit more first.

502
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:18,750
Papi told me Dr. Freedman
is bringing in a judge.

503
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:23,041
Please. I don't want chemo.

504
00:25:25,166 --> 00:25:27,583
Do you believe a shaman
can heal you?

505
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:28,750
Papi does.

506
00:25:28,792 --> 00:25:31,000
Forget your father
and Dr. Freedman.

507
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:33,750
I wanna know what you believe.

508
00:25:33,792 --> 00:25:35,458
If you have faith in the shaman,

509
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,000
I will back you with the judge.

510
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,041
It's okay. You can tell me.

511
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,792
Elisa, what is it?

512
00:25:46,792 --> 00:25:49,000
I don't want chemo.

513
00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:01,917
Addison?

514
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:06,250
How long you been out here?
I don't know.

515
00:26:07,834 --> 00:26:09,709
I couldn't sleep.

516
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,083
Hey.

517
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:13,709
It's gonna be okay.

518
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,250
Not if Violet doesn't talk
to Charlotte.

519
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:16,417
She will.

520
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:19,000
What if somebody decides to look

521
00:26:19,041 --> 00:26:20,041
in the lab fridge, you know?

522
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:21,834
And they wonder what
the Jane Doe bag is?

523
00:26:21,875 --> 00:26:24,041
I don't know what
I was thinking.

524
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:26,041
You were thinking that
you wanted to help a friend.

525
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:29,750
I could lose my license, Sam.
What am I supposed to do?

526
00:26:32,125 --> 00:26:33,709
We wait.

527
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,500
Violet will come through.

528
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:40,917
Charlotte:
Is that fresh?

529
00:26:40,959 --> 00:26:43,000
I just made it.

530
00:26:44,083 --> 00:26:45,750
Help yourself.

531
00:26:47,959 --> 00:26:49,000
Thank you, Sheldon.

532
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,291
For what?

533
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:54,000
Leaving me alone.

534
00:26:56,542 --> 00:26:59,000
I wish everybody
else would just, uh...

535
00:27:01,083 --> 00:27:02,625
...do nothing.

536
00:27:02,667 --> 00:27:05,750
I'd do nothing
for you anytime.

537
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:06,959
You know that, right?

538
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:10,542
I do.

539
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,583
How's it going?

540
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:20,667
Just dandy. Thanks.

541
00:27:20,709 --> 00:27:23,000
You know, I, uh...

542
00:27:24,792 --> 00:27:28,625
I know how hard it can be to
reintegrate after you've been...

543
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:33,041
...victimized.
So if you ever wanna talk...

544
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:34,542
You always been such a busybody

545
00:27:34,583 --> 00:27:36,750
or is that just
a professional hazard?

546
00:27:36,792 --> 00:27:39,667
Heh. No, actually,
Charlotte, i--

547
00:27:39,709 --> 00:27:42,208
I truly believe
in the therapeutic process.

548
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,792
And after Katie attacked me--

549
00:27:43,834 --> 00:27:45,583
you think because a crazy woman
cut out your baby

550
00:27:45,625 --> 00:27:47,041
you've got
some kind of an insight

551
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:48,250
into what makes me tick?

552
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:52,083
You don't.

553
00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:56,041
All you've got is a nasty scar
and a horror story.

554
00:27:56,083 --> 00:28:00,291
You're damaged goods, Violet.
You, not me.

555
00:28:01,667 --> 00:28:05,542
You got no business telling
anybody how to run their lives.

556
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:15,875
Pete:
You got any tips for getting
a 14-year-old to talk?

557
00:28:15,917 --> 00:28:18,041
I really wanna
go to bat for Elisa,

558
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:19,542
but she's holding
something back.

559
00:28:19,583 --> 00:28:21,125
Well, she's a kid.

560
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:23,792
Even as adults, we're reluctant

561
00:28:23,834 --> 00:28:25,750
to say certain things out loud.

562
00:28:25,792 --> 00:28:27,041
You know, it makes it real.

563
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:29,667
And then, you know,
you have to deal with it.

564
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:31,458
I wouldn't know
anything about that.

565
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,667
Pete Wilder, open book.

566
00:28:36,208 --> 00:28:39,625
I know. It's not fair.

567
00:28:39,667 --> 00:28:41,208
I push you to tell me things.

568
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:43,000
And then I have stuff myself.

569
00:28:46,917 --> 00:28:49,709
There was...

570
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,667
Well, it happened
a long time ago.

571
00:28:51,709 --> 00:28:53,041
In college.

572
00:28:53,083 --> 00:28:56,000
And I never told you.

573
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:02,000
Violet, I know.

574
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:05,917
Or, at least, I suspected.

575
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:13,500
We have been through a lot.

576
00:29:13,542 --> 00:29:17,000
And I've seen you react
in so many ways.

577
00:29:21,041 --> 00:29:22,500
Why didn't you say anything?

578
00:29:23,542 --> 00:29:25,041
I figured that when
you were ready

579
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:26,542
to talk about it, you would.

580
00:29:36,792 --> 00:29:38,208
I'm probably wrong.

581
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,875
What?

582
00:29:39,917 --> 00:29:41,959
Well, you were the first one
to see her that night.

583
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Is it possible...?

584
00:29:45,542 --> 00:29:46,834
Was Charlotte raped?

585
00:29:46,875 --> 00:29:48,959
If she told me,
you know I couldn't--

586
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,583
no, I know. I know. Of course.

587
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
But what do you think?

588
00:29:58,583 --> 00:30:00,000
I think you're right.

589
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:19,709
Don't.

590
00:30:38,166 --> 00:30:40,542
What can I do?

591
00:30:40,583 --> 00:30:42,000
What do you need?

592
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,834
Lie really close to me.

593
00:30:50,417 --> 00:30:52,125
But don't touch me.

594
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:20,041
It's been a long time
since I wore a pair of these.

595
00:31:20,083 --> 00:31:21,542
What are you doing here?

596
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:22,834
I came to wish you luck.

597
00:31:22,875 --> 00:31:24,125
Thanks.

598
00:31:24,166 --> 00:31:26,041
You know, Nick and Rachel,
they're special.

599
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:28,333
A lot of couples stay together
for the long haul,

600
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:29,583
but not many stay in love.

601
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:31,250
Your parents still married?
Ha, ha.

602
00:31:31,291 --> 00:31:33,333
No, they split
when I was a teenager.

603
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:34,542
Waterboarding in Guantánamo

604
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:36,250
was less brutal
than that divorce.

605
00:31:36,291 --> 00:31:38,250
Are you close to them?
I call my mother every week.

606
00:31:38,291 --> 00:31:40,583
But my father and I...

607
00:31:40,625 --> 00:31:44,250
Well, let's just say that when
you wash out of your er rotation

608
00:31:44,291 --> 00:31:45,834
and you're a surgeon's son,

609
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:47,625
it doesn't help
the relationship.

610
00:31:47,667 --> 00:31:50,709
I guess it can make you
a little odd and pretentious.

611
00:31:52,208 --> 00:31:54,834
Who's to say
those are bad things?

612
00:31:54,875 --> 00:31:56,750
Call you when it's over.

613
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:02,041
Alice believed in chemo
and I believed in Alice,

614
00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:04,208
so that's what we did.

615
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:05,917
But she's gone now.

616
00:32:05,959 --> 00:32:07,417
I've seen
the shaman heal people.

617
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:09,917
I think she can do the same
for my Elisa.

618
00:32:09,959 --> 00:32:12,083
What do you want, Elisa?

619
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:15,041
What papi wants.

620
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:16,542
Cooper:
And what about your mother?

621
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:18,041
Alice would have pushed
for chemo.

622
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:20,083
She wouldn't want you to die.
Diego: Don't say that.

623
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:21,750
How dare you say that?
She's not gonna die.

624
00:32:21,792 --> 00:32:23,750
Your honor,
what Diego is asking for

625
00:32:23,792 --> 00:32:26,458
may seem unconventional,
but I have seen it work.

626
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,500
As an m.D.
And also a practitioner

627
00:32:28,542 --> 00:32:30,625
of alternative therapies,
I urge you, please,

628
00:32:30,667 --> 00:32:32,458
don't disregard
what Diego is asking for.

629
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,542
The only guaranteed cure
for lymphoma is chemotherapy.

630
00:32:35,583 --> 00:32:39,083
I need to take the family's
religious beliefs into account--

631
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:40,625
okay, what kind of father
just stands by

632
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:41,834
and doesn't save their child?

633
00:32:41,875 --> 00:32:44,166
Stop it. Please, Dr. Freedman.

634
00:32:46,083 --> 00:32:49,000
If I have more chemo,
my family won't make it.

635
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,583
We're living in a trailer park
because of me.

636
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:56,792
My treatments bankrupted us
and papi had to sell the house.

637
00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:03,542
I hear you on the phone begging
to keep the power on.

638
00:33:03,583 --> 00:33:07,500
I see you skipping meals
so the rest of us can eat.

639
00:33:07,542 --> 00:33:09,750
Carlos and Pilar,

640
00:33:09,792 --> 00:33:11,458
they deserve a life
that doesn't revolve

641
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,667
around my hospital visits.

642
00:33:12,709 --> 00:33:13,834
Diego:
And so do you.

643
00:33:15,834 --> 00:33:17,166
The shaman will save you.

644
00:33:17,208 --> 00:33:18,625
No, she won't.

645
00:33:18,667 --> 00:33:20,709
I'm sorry, papi.

646
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,625
I don't believe
what you believe.

647
00:33:25,792 --> 00:33:27,959
I'm not afraid.

648
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,792
Let the shaman take me to mama.

649
00:33:33,667 --> 00:33:36,542
I think we all know
what needs to be done.

650
00:33:45,417 --> 00:33:47,125
Do you think I don't know
what's true anymore

651
00:33:47,166 --> 00:33:48,166
because I was attacked?

652
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:50,583
I think working
through that experience

653
00:33:50,625 --> 00:33:51,667
has made you a better therapist.

654
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,041
Sam told me
I should talk to Charlotte.

655
00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:56,208
Well, that's not surprising.

656
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,041
You both survived
a brutal trauma.

657
00:33:58,083 --> 00:33:59,750
Yeah, yeah.
But the way he said it,

658
00:33:59,792 --> 00:34:02,208
it was like there was
more to it than that.

659
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,667
And then I started projecting
my own stuff on her.

660
00:34:05,792 --> 00:34:07,000
Well, what sort of stuff?

661
00:34:09,709 --> 00:34:11,834
I wish you had been there.

662
00:34:11,875 --> 00:34:14,166
That night. Then we could
compare notes.

663
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:16,667
Unfortunately, I spent the night
in an interrogation room

664
00:34:16,709 --> 00:34:19,458
getting throttled
by a rapist, so...

665
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,834
Is that what--?

666
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:25,333
Do you think Charlotte
was raped?

667
00:34:30,458 --> 00:34:31,875
Pete:
The judge ordered the chemo.

668
00:34:31,917 --> 00:34:33,250
You didn't have to arrange this.

669
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:35,041
Cooper: I know.
Pete: I'm just saying...

670
00:34:35,083 --> 00:34:36,917
Cooper:
I'm not completely unreasonable.

671
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:48,792
Cooper:
Thank you for letting
us bend the rules.

672
00:34:48,834 --> 00:34:52,291
I made sure she wasn't gonna
sacrifice a chicken or anything.

673
00:34:56,542 --> 00:35:01,500
I know I should leave you alone,
but here's the thing:

674
00:35:01,542 --> 00:35:02,709
I can't.

675
00:35:04,166 --> 00:35:05,625
You're not ready.

676
00:35:05,667 --> 00:35:06,875
Cooper--

677
00:35:06,917 --> 00:35:08,041
I know you.

678
00:36:33,417 --> 00:36:36,417
Rachel:
It didn't go well, did it?

679
00:36:36,458 --> 00:36:40,375
The tumor was worse than
the imaging originally showed.

680
00:36:40,417 --> 00:36:44,208
I couldn't resect it all.
I removed what I could.

681
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:46,458
Nick:
No. I can't accept that.

682
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,000
You have to stop the cancer.

683
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:51,583
How long do I have?

684
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,041
Not as long as you'd want.

685
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:58,583
Oh.

686
00:36:59,667 --> 00:37:01,750
There are
testosterone-blocking agents

687
00:37:01,792 --> 00:37:04,834
we could try
to manage your anger,

688
00:37:04,875 --> 00:37:06,333
but they're not
very effective.

689
00:37:06,375 --> 00:37:08,959
So I'm just gonna
keep on hurting Nick?

690
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,125
There's nothing I can do?

691
00:37:10,166 --> 00:37:11,792
Sheldon:
You can move into hospice

692
00:37:11,834 --> 00:37:13,291
for round-the-clock
care with people

693
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:14,667
who know how
to manage your anger

694
00:37:14,709 --> 00:37:15,875
and keep you safe.

695
00:37:15,917 --> 00:37:17,875
What the hell
are you talking about?

696
00:37:17,917 --> 00:37:19,709
Don't listen to him, Rachel.

697
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:21,083
We can manage at home.

698
00:37:23,709 --> 00:37:26,875
You know that's not true, love.

699
00:37:27,959 --> 00:37:29,041
I'm dying.

700
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,500
You don't know
how long you have.

701
00:37:34,542 --> 00:37:37,041
I want that time with you.

702
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:38,625
I don't care what you do to me.

703
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:41,417
But I do.

704
00:37:43,959 --> 00:37:45,291
Those people at hospice,

705
00:37:45,333 --> 00:37:48,667
they won't know how
to take care of you.

706
00:37:48,709 --> 00:37:53,083
I've learned that over the past
20 years. I'm good at it.

707
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:54,542
Well, then,
you'll tell them how.

708
00:37:54,583 --> 00:37:57,750
Every day,
when you come to visit.

709
00:38:01,333 --> 00:38:03,959
You'll find a place
where I can go?

710
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,125
Yes. I promise.

711
00:38:10,542 --> 00:38:13,333
Rachel:
It's the right thing, Nick.

712
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:14,667
You know it is.

713
00:38:15,875 --> 00:38:17,041
Please.

714
00:38:17,083 --> 00:38:20,750
Let me take care
of you for once.

715
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:25,792
Rachel:
Shh, shh, shh.

716
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:32,000
Yeah?

717
00:38:36,792 --> 00:38:37,917
You need something?

718
00:38:42,709 --> 00:38:45,500
It was an Indian summer

719
00:38:45,542 --> 00:38:47,208
my junior year in college,

720
00:38:48,417 --> 00:38:50,250
and I'd left the window open

721
00:38:50,291 --> 00:38:51,458
because it was the only way

722
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,208
to cool down enough
to get to sleep.

723
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:58,333
So when I first
felt his breath on me,

724
00:38:58,375 --> 00:39:01,875
I thought,
"finally, a breeze."

725
00:39:01,917 --> 00:39:04,000
And then I opened my eyes.

726
00:39:06,083 --> 00:39:10,166
He wrapped one hand
around my throat

727
00:39:10,208 --> 00:39:14,750
and with the other
ripped off my panties.

728
00:39:14,792 --> 00:39:18,000
He whispered to me:

729
00:39:18,041 --> 00:39:19,583
"Shh, shh, shh."

730
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:21,750
Like, um...

731
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:24,709
Like you do to a child

732
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:26,959
having a bad dream.

733
00:39:28,083 --> 00:39:31,834
He told me
not to make a sound.

734
00:39:31,875 --> 00:39:35,166
And when he finished,

735
00:39:35,208 --> 00:39:38,041
he slammed my head
against the wall

736
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:41,000
till my hair
was sticky with blood.

737
00:39:43,458 --> 00:39:45,083
I thought...

738
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:53,125
...that if I stayed quiet,
then I'd be okay.

739
00:39:53,166 --> 00:39:55,792
Like it never happened.

740
00:39:58,083 --> 00:40:01,709
Because things like that--

741
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:04,000
well, they don't happen
to people like me.

742
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,041
Or to people like you.

743
00:40:08,917 --> 00:40:10,500
So...

744
00:40:13,667 --> 00:40:16,083
I just
wanted you to know...

745
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:20,625
...that I get it.

746
00:40:20,667 --> 00:40:22,834
I get it, Charlotte.

747
00:40:29,083 --> 00:40:31,333
And I'm here for you.

748
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:22,709
Shelly. What are you doing here?

749
00:41:24,083 --> 00:41:26,583
The guy I evaluated last week?
Lee McHenry?

750
00:41:26,625 --> 00:41:27,709
Yeah.

751
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,834
I think I know who he raped.

752
00:41:47,458 --> 00:41:50,041
Yes, this is
Dr. Addison Montgomery

753
00:41:50,083 --> 00:41:51,583
at St. ambrose.

754
00:41:51,625 --> 00:41:53,417
I have pelvic washings

755
00:41:53,458 --> 00:41:56,000
from a rape
that need to be processed.

756
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:09,542
Charlotte? What happened?

757
00:42:09,583 --> 00:42:12,083
Will you go
to a meeting with me?

758
00:42:12,125 --> 00:42:14,125
I'm right behind you.
