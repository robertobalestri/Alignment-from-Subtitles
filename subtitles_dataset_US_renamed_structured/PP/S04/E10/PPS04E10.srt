00:00:06,667 --> 00:00:09,041
What do you mean,
you're not charging him?

3
00:00:09,083 --> 00:00:11,333
I'm not charging him.
Sorry.
I heard you.

4
00:00:11,375 --> 00:00:13,333
But what do you mean,
you're not charging him?

5
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:15,041
Look, mister--
Dr. Freedman.

6
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:17,583
Dr. Cooper Freedman.
This is Dr. Charlotte king.

7
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:20,041
The man you should be charging
is Lee McHenry.

8
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:21,583
Do you know the case?

9
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:23,834
Okay, we'd like
another lawyer--

10
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:27,667
someone who knows what
they're doing, someone good.

11
00:00:27,709 --> 00:00:29,458
Ms. King's first statement
to the police

12
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,458
was that she was robbed--
not raped, robbed.

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,542
She lied to the police,
which taints her as a witness.

14
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,041
The rape kit wasn't processed

15
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:37,041
until two weeks after
the alleged rape,

16
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:38,542
which taints the evidence.

17
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:41,583
Ms. King failed to identify
Lee McHenry in the first lineup.

18
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:44,166
The second lineup came only
after a Dr. Sheldon Wallace,

19
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:46,166
from your practice,
spoke to Lee McHenry,

20
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:48,250
so that's also tainted.

21
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:50,250
And, Ms. King,
I mean no disrespect,

22
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:53,000
but you're a sex therapist with
a history of meeting strange men

23
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:55,500
from the Internet for what can
at best be described

24
00:00:55,542 --> 00:00:57,500
as fetishistic
sexual encounters.

25
00:00:57,542 --> 00:01:00,041
I know the case.

26
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:03,291
Mr. Freedman, I graduated first
in my class from Stanford.

27
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:05,542
I have a 90% conviction rate
here in the D.A.'s office,

28
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:07,583
100% on rape,
so I'm pretty damn good,

29
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:10,000
which is why I can say to you
without hesitation

30
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:13,000
that there is no way this office
is going to charge Lee McHenry.

31
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:15,542
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:22,500
Have a nice day.

33
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,542
This is
the ribbon cutting ceremony

34
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:46,417
of the new hospital
in western India.

35
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:48,875
This was also the day
that Olivia sat up on her own

36
00:01:48,917 --> 00:01:51,458
for the first time.
Maya and I skyped.
That's incredible.

37
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,625
That's
quite an accomplishment.

38
00:01:53,667 --> 00:01:55,500
The hospital, I mean.
But Olivia's great, too.

39
00:01:55,542 --> 00:01:58,083
Yeah. And here,
the foundation is delivering

40
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:01,458
a boatload
of mosquito nets to Tanzania.
Wow.

41
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,750
Boatload. It's an actual boat
loaded with mosquito nets.

42
00:02:03,792 --> 00:02:05,625
That's so cool.

43
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,709
Actually, that's where I was
when I found out about,

44
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,041
uh, Betsey's aunt
abandoning her.

45
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:13,125
Um...

46
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,959
This is Laos, and here,
we were able to deliver

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,667
enough vaccine
to immunize 2,000 children.

48
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:19,917
Wow.

49
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:21,917
Yeah, and that's where I was

50
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:24,583
when I found out
about Charlotte.

51
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,667
Yeah, a lot...

52
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:29,000
Has happened
since you've been gone.

53
00:02:31,792 --> 00:02:33,375
Uh, oh.

54
00:02:33,417 --> 00:02:35,125
I have a patient.

55
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,125
It was great
to see you, Nai.

56
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:40,166
Yeah.
All right.

57
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:42,208
What was that?

58
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,041
Nothing.
You look amazing.

59
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,750
- I mean, for someone...
- You do.

60
00:02:45,792 --> 00:02:47,542
Who's trekked across
three continents...

61
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:49,542
Oh, you know, I just--

62
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,542
I'm all "eat pray love,"
you know?

63
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,917
I'm--i'm, uh, very zen.
Zen?

64
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:55,834
Does that mean
you're now all right

65
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,834
with Addison sleeping
with your ex-husband?
Amelia!

66
00:02:57,875 --> 00:02:59,959
Filter.
Sorry. I'm working on it.

67
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,917
Well, I for one am glad
to have you back, so...
Thank you.

68
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:06,500
All right, truth--
how is Charlotte?

69
00:03:06,542 --> 00:03:08,667
Rape-y and weird.

70
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:10,542
Filter.

71
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:13,041
Charlotte... is doing
the best she can.

72
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:15,041
Hey.

73
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,041
Emily wendal
is back in the E.R.

74
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:18,750
Damn it.

75
00:03:18,792 --> 00:03:19,834
Again?

76
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:22,834
What,
who is Emily wendal?

77
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,959
You should come, too.

78
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,041
Hey, um... the guys
are playing poker tonight.

79
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,583
You want to do a girls' night,
get all of us together,

80
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,333
catch up?
Uh, yeah, yeah, I'm in.

81
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,041
Yeah?
Yeah.

82
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:37,458
I'm glad you're back.

83
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,792
I missed you.

84
00:03:40,834 --> 00:03:43,667
Are you okay
with her screwing Sam?

85
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:45,166
Filter.
Yeah.

86
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,709
Got it.
Okay.

87
00:03:52,917 --> 00:03:56,041
I don't know. I'm gonna try
to make some phone calls,

88
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:58,625
see if there's anything
I can...

89
00:03:58,667 --> 00:04:01,041
How do they
not charge the bastard?

90
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:04,500
What will be will be.

91
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:06,875
Charlotte...

92
00:04:06,917 --> 00:04:08,875
You seem fine.

93
00:04:08,917 --> 00:04:11,625
Are you...
Are you okay with this,

94
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:14,208
with them
letting that guy walk?

95
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,834
I'm right as rain.

96
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,333
Okay. Good.

97
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,333
I just want to make sure
that you feel

98
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,333
like you're in control
of what happens.

99
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,041
This is your case.

100
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,625
You know, you have
the right to feel safe.

101
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:28,875
I'm in the driver's seat now.
Of course you are.

102
00:04:28,917 --> 00:04:30,875
And I know
recovery is a process,

103
00:04:30,917 --> 00:04:33,041
so it's okay
if you're not fine.

104
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:36,041
But we will get through it,
together.

105
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:39,333
You know, it's a marathon,
not a sprint.

106
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,917
Right.

107
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:42,917
And we can go back there,

108
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,917
we can
make the D.A. charge him.

109
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:47,208
I don't know how, but I will
think of something.

110
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,000
It's always darkest
before the dawn.

111
00:05:00,709 --> 00:05:04,542
It's always darkest
before the dawn.

112
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:09,000
Emily wendal presented with
hypertension and early labor.

113
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,500
Treated with labetalol.

114
00:05:10,542 --> 00:05:12,750
Blood pressure stabilized.

115
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:15,041
Her history includes
preeclampsia and drug addiction.

116
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,041
Every ten months,
right on schedule.

117
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,041
I heard Emily's back.
What, is she famous?

118
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,709
She's a frequent flyer.

119
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,041
Gets knocked up every year
or so,

120
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,750
then shows up in the E.R.
when she's close to term.
Hey, I don't have
any cash on me. Do--

121
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,750
I do, I do, I do. Technically,
it's my turn, right?

122
00:05:27,792 --> 00:05:29,750
'Cause you did the last two,

123
00:05:29,792 --> 00:05:32,041
and Charlotte did
the one before that.
Wh-wh-why do we need cash?

124
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,959
We give her 50 bucks,
she gives up her baby.
What?

125
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,291
It's--
well, no, no, I mean, first I
offer her rehab and therapy.

126
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,417
I give her the lecture
on sobriety, blah, blah, blah.

127
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,792
And then you lecture about
safe sex, offer to put in one of

128
00:05:42,834 --> 00:05:44,959
those implant-y birth control
things that go in her arm,

129
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,709
blah, blah, blah,
she will refuse,

130
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,291
then you will deliver the baby,

131
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,291
and then Pete,
because she only likes Pete,

132
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:53,542
will give her $50,
and she'll give us the baby.
Well, she likes me

133
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:56,208
because I've helped her get
clean, what, like, three times?
Yeah.

134
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,208
Not that it ever lasts
more than a week.
Anyway, it shouldn't take
too long.

135
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,583
I'll get social services
on the phone,

136
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:04,542
let 'em know
we got one coming.
Okay, I'll get the paperwork
for her to sign.

137
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,625
So you want
to examine her first,

138
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:10,041
or you want me to do
my shrink dance first?
What?

139
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:13,041
Cooper. Hey.

140
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,417
Naomi. Welcome back. Hey.

141
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:19,542
I am so sorry I couldn't come
when I heard about Charlotte.

142
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,625
How you holding up?

143
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:23,875
We, uh, we're good.
Yeah?

144
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:26,041
Okay. Dealing.

145
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,542
Yeah.

146
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,583
Oh, my god.
Look, Justin Taylor.

147
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:32,583
Yeah?
I haven't seen this kid
in, like, three years.

148
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,625
I thought he had moved
or something. He's...

149
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:36,875
He's one of the good ones.

150
00:06:36,917 --> 00:06:38,875
He used to make me
these great mix cds--

151
00:06:38,917 --> 00:06:40,667
Dr. Freedman.

152
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:43,000
It's me, Justin.

153
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,667
I brought you
this playlist.
Oh, yeah?

154
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:56,458
All sick indie bands,

155
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,041
including death finger's
new track.

156
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,709
Awesome. Thank you.
Hey, how'd you get here?

157
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,041
I took the bus.

158
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,417
And your parents,
do they know you're here?

159
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:08,458
I-I didn't want to bother them.
They're busy, you know, at work.

160
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,959
Okay, okay.

161
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,500
Justin, I'm concerned

162
00:07:12,542 --> 00:07:14,500
because you've gained
a lot of weight

163
00:07:14,542 --> 00:07:17,500
since the last time I saw you--
a significant amount of weight.

164
00:07:17,542 --> 00:07:19,500
I know.
I keep getting bigger,

165
00:07:19,542 --> 00:07:21,500
and it's gotten harder
to get around,

166
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:23,500
like, a lot harder
just recently.

167
00:07:23,542 --> 00:07:26,542
Okay. Can you
get on the scale for me?

168
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:30,000
It's okay.
It's just you and me.

169
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:52,500
How much?

170
00:07:52,542 --> 00:07:55,583
You've gained 282 pounds.

171
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,375
Oh, man.

172
00:07:57,417 --> 00:07:59,375
It's okay. It's okay.

173
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:03,500
We just need to talk about it,
okay? Come on.

174
00:08:03,542 --> 00:08:05,500
And how many weeks along
are you?

175
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:07,041
Uh, eight months maybe.

176
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,709
How many weeks is that?
I'm not so good with math.

177
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,291
Or prenatal care.

178
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:14,375
Are you taking any
prenatal vitamins this time?

179
00:08:14,417 --> 00:08:17,041
Getting exams at any of those
free clinics we told you about?

180
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:20,959
I've been busy.
The ultrasound puts the baby
at 37 weeks.

181
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,083
Heartbeat's strong.

182
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,792
But your pressure is still
a little on the high side,

183
00:08:25,834 --> 00:08:28,208
so I'd like to keep you
overnight for observation.

184
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,709
Because the baby is breech,

185
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,583
we'll have to do
a c-section tomorrow.
Okay.

186
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:35,041
Looks like you get three hots
and a cot this time, Emily.

187
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,291
So I will tell Dr. King
to hold off d.C.F.S.

188
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:40,333
For picking up the baby
till tomorrow.
No. I don't want
d.C.F.S. To come.

189
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:43,041
I didn't ask you to do that.

190
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,375
Look, those other times,
I was an addict.

191
00:08:45,417 --> 00:08:47,834
I-I didn't have a place to live.
I had issues.
You had issues?

192
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,834
You can't take away
this baby.

193
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,792
I got clean a month or two
before I even got knocked up,

194
00:08:52,834 --> 00:08:55,750
and--and I've been trying
to quit smoking.

195
00:08:55,792 --> 00:08:57,750
I swear.
Do any drug test you want.

196
00:08:57,792 --> 00:09:00,041
Look, this baby, it's gonna be
healthy, and I want to keep it.

197
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,667
Emily,
that is not a good idea.
I'll do whatever you want.
Please.

198
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,667
I want to keep this baby.

199
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:07,375
Dr. Montgomery, please don't
let her take away my baby.

200
00:09:07,417 --> 00:09:10,625
No one is gonna take away
your baby. Okay?

201
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:14,208
I'm gonna help you.

202
00:09:22,667 --> 00:09:25,041
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Taylor.

203
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:27,458
I'm Dr. Bennett.

204
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,625
How is it possible
that he is this fat?

205
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:32,500
Uh, well, we--
we are concerned.

206
00:09:32,542 --> 00:09:36,417
Justin is diabetic,
and he has high blood pressure.

207
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,166
And that puts him at risk

208
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,709
for even more
serious medical complications.

209
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,625
He's lazy and he doesn't
want to lose weight.

210
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:45,166
I have no control over
what he does or doesn't do.

211
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,875
You're his parents.
That's your job.

212
00:09:47,917 --> 00:09:49,834
What Dr. Freedman means
is that

213
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:52,709
Justin needs proper nutrition
and exercise

214
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:56,083
and medication compliance
to get his health back on track.

215
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,333
We sent him to fat camp,
we hired a nutritionist,

216
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,625
and we got him a trainer.

217
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:04,709
Could it be a thyroid condition
or a tumor on some gland?

218
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,709
We ran tests and ruled out

219
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,834
any underlying causes
for the weight gain.

220
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,041
I don't want
to get any bigger.

221
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,542
I don't feel good.

222
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,333
He sneaks food.

223
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,667
I find candy wrappers
under your bed all the time.

224
00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:19,041
- He's trying, Bruce.
- Look, could we just stop

225
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,625
and try to be constructive?
Are you still
gonna be saying that

226
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:24,041
when he's 600 pounds,
Dr. Freedman?

227
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,333
I mean, i-I'd put a lock
on the fridge

228
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,875
if I didn't think
he'd eat it off.
Justin?

229
00:10:29,917 --> 00:10:33,250
Are you okay?
I feel a little dizzy.

230
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:35,041
Justin.

231
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,542
Justin!

232
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,875
His pulse is sky high.

233
00:10:40,917 --> 00:10:43,041
Yeah.
I'll get oxygen.

234
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,583
Okay.

235
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:47,083
Get me an I.V. Cart
and call an ambulance, please.

236
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,709
Here.

237
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,667
People can change, Violet.
I know you believe that.

238
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:55,625
Why not Emily?
We have tried, Addison,
again and again.

239
00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:58,166
But it won't take
because she doesn't want it to.

240
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,959
Ten minutes after I get her
clean, she goes out to score.

241
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,083
I-I beg a shelter
to find a bed for her,

242
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:06,041
and she never shows up.
The best thing would be
if she stopped

243
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,041
having babies altogether.
We should tie her tubes.

244
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:11,000
You're doing her c-section
tomorrow. You could do it then.

245
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:14,000
I am not gonna sterilize a woman
without her knowledge.

246
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,542
I need her consent.
Well, it's the only way
to keep her

247
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:19,041
from coming back pregnant
in a year.
Okay, okay, look,
Emily is a disaster.

248
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,041
No one wants to see
her coming back pregnant,

249
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,041
but Addison is right.

250
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:26,041
She has to sign off
on the sterilization.
Just because Emily's made
bad decisions

251
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:29,333
doesn't mean that we take away
her right to have children.
Why are we only
discussing her rights?

252
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,542
What about David's rights?
Who's David?

253
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,041
Her firstborn.
Eight weeks premature.

254
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,583
He went blind
from being on a ventilator.

255
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,583
He's been in seven homes
in six years.

256
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:40,208
Turns out he's not only blind.
He's autistic.

257
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,667
Brad was second.

258
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:43,667
He's severely disabled
due to fetal alcohol syndrome.

259
00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:45,667
He's in a home
for special needs kids.

260
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:48,750
Then there's April, who's--well,
she's still in foster care,

261
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,959
'cause who wants a crack baby?
And then...

262
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,458
There's Daniel,

263
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,041
who survived for 16
excruciating days in n.I.C.U.

264
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:57,667
Before he succumbed
to short bowel syndrome.

265
00:11:57,709 --> 00:12:00,000
I signed
his death certificate myself.
You think she wants
this baby?

266
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,834
She doesn't want this baby.
She has an angle.

267
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:06,041
She always has an angle.
She's not gonna change,
Addison. Tie her tubes.

268
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,041
Without her consent, I can't.

269
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,542
I'm sorry.
I won't do it.

270
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,625
Justin. How is he?

271
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:18,875
Um, his blood sugar spiked,

272
00:12:18,917 --> 00:12:20,583
which caused
profound dehydration

273
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,041
and electrolyte
abnormalities.

274
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,625
He's gonna wake up, right?
Uh, well, yeah. He's--

275
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:28,166
he's a little bit disoriented
and confused, but he should

276
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:30,625
respond to treatment
within the next 12 hours.

277
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:33,250
- We're gonna bring down his blood sugar, but slowly.
- But he'll be all right.

278
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:36,667
- I mean, he's not gonna die.
- Well, that depends on what you're willing to do.

279
00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:39,041
He's a teenager with the health
of a 70 year old.

280
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,875
He could stroke out
at any minute.

281
00:12:40,917 --> 00:12:43,333
- He's at risk for a heart attack.
- You coddle him too much.

282
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,041
You always have.
I love him.

283
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,667
I'm not like you--

284
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:49,750
the way you look at him
with such disgust.

285
00:12:49,792 --> 00:12:52,083
I mean, how do you think
that makes him feel?

286
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:55,208
Of course he eats.
He needs comfort.
What he needs is discipline.

287
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,667
You make him think it's okay
to inhale all the crap he wants.
Okay, why don't--

288
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:00,750
why don't we go into the lounge
and discuss this?

289
00:13:00,792 --> 00:13:03,041
I don't want to talk to you.

290
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:06,709
And I don't want you
around my baby.

291
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,667
I'm going back to work.
You're leaving?

292
00:13:19,542 --> 00:13:22,125
Hey. Is everything okay here?

293
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:25,542
Yeah. I was just
checking up on Emily.

294
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,750
Your tox screens
came back negative,

295
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:29,750
and you don't have
any s.T.D.S.

296
00:13:29,792 --> 00:13:32,041
I told you
this baby was healthy.

297
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,750
I've been thinking,
after the delivery,

298
00:13:34,792 --> 00:13:37,041
you should tie my tubes.

299
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:40,166
Did you come up with that idea
on your own?

300
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:42,917
I've just been going over
the basics, the anatomy--

301
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,917
did he also explain that
this is a permanent choice?

302
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:49,417
That's the point, right?
Emily, there are other forms
of birth control that

303
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:52,625
would preserve the option of
having children in the future.

304
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:54,625
We went over
all the options.

305
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,041
This is her decision.

306
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:59,500
Sorry. I have to get back
to the E.R.

307
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,583
If he pressured you
in any way, i--

308
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,125
he didn't.

309
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,041
What he said makes sense.

310
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:11,041
And I want to give this baby
and me the best possible shot.

311
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,750
So do it, Dr. Montgomery.

312
00:14:13,792 --> 00:14:17,458
Tie my tubes.

313
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,959
You think Pete bribed her?

314
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
That's what they do
with Emily.

315
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,000
They give her money to get her
to do what they want.
Well, that's one way
of helping.

316
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,000
What, you think
she should keep the baby?

317
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,166
I mean, do you think
that she wants to change?

318
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:33,583
I would like to help Emily
improve her life.
So you think Pete, Violet,
and Charlotte couldn't,

319
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:36,583
but--but you can?
I'd like to try.

320
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,583
Is this for your sake
or for hers?

321
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:42,250
What's that supposed to mean?

322
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:46,792
W--

323
00:14:49,917 --> 00:14:51,834
what?

324
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,375
I'm supposed to filter.

325
00:14:54,417 --> 00:14:57,083
Oh, just say it.
Okay. This is
the baby thing, right?

326
00:14:57,125 --> 00:15:00,709
She told you she wants a baby,
and you didn't say anything,

327
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,625
and even though she told you
not to say anything,

328
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:07,500
she's mad that you didn't
say anything, and so now sh--
ah. Filter.

329
00:15:07,542 --> 00:15:10,000
I have got to get
my own life.

330
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:17,625
My 15-year-old patient--
Justin--

331
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:20,375
gained 300 pounds
in 3 years,

332
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:22,792
and mommy and daddy were
too busy to notice.

333
00:15:22,834 --> 00:15:25,333
So you're blaming
the parents?
You wouldn't?

334
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,625
Well, in all fairness,
Justin is the one

335
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:30,417
putting the food in his mouth.
Well, no, I get
that he's eating,

336
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:33,750
- but the parents let it get too far.
- So did he.

337
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:35,625
Whoa.

338
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:37,750
Shrink mind meld.
Creepy.

339
00:15:37,792 --> 00:15:40,041
Give me back my fries.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Hey, there she is.
There she is. Hi.

340
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,667
Oh, hey. Hey.
Oh, hey.

341
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:44,667
How's she doing?

342
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:46,750
Sweetie.

343
00:15:46,792 --> 00:15:49,542
Yeah.

344
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,667
Hey. How you doing?

345
00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:53,667
Oh, first day
of the rest of my life.

346
00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:55,041
Feel good?

347
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,667
What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger.

348
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:03,041
You saw that, right?
It's not just me? You saw that?

349
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,041
The clichés--
she only speaks in clichés.

350
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,500
She's got a million of 'em.
And the smiley thing?

351
00:16:07,542 --> 00:16:09,041
Well, she's certainly...
Chipper.

352
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,542
But Charlotte's not
a smiley person.
Exactly.

353
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,583
Well, it's a--it's
a coping mechanism, Coop.

354
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,959
Okay, but she's not coping.

355
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,500
What do I do?

356
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:22,542
Mm-hmm. Where's
your mind meld now, bitches?

357
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:28,583
How much did you pay Emily
to get her tubes tied?

358
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:33,000
She said yes to $250.
I would've gone higher.

359
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,959
Pete, completely unethical.
There are nonprofits
in all 50 states

360
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,041
offering drug-addicted women
financial incentives

361
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:41,041
to have their tubes tied.
Yeah, but we don't work
for those organizations.

362
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,542
We're doctors.
And there are three million
cases of child abuse a year.

363
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:46,041
Drug and alcohol abuse

364
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:48,041
are a contributing factor
in most of them.

365
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,792
Usually you're more practical
than this.
Emily isn't just
some statistic.

366
00:16:50,834 --> 00:16:53,542
She's a woman, okay, who could
wake up ten years from now,

367
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,083
still clean and sober,

368
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,709
and wish that she could
have another child.

369
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,417
Okay, look, I fully recognize

370
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,917
that what we're doing is
unethical, possibly illegal.

371
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:04,834
I understand that. But you
know me. You know Violet.

372
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,792
She's the one
that can't stop herself

373
00:17:06,834 --> 00:17:10,333
from helping criminals,
pedophiles, you name it.

374
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:13,041
If the two of us are saying
that Emily is a lost cause,

375
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:15,041
doesn't that
tell you something?

376
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,125
- Yes.
- Hi.

377
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,041
Hi, baby.

378
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:27,041
I didn't realize
this was a play date.

379
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,041
Oh, I gave Maya
the night off.

380
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,041
Aren't you?
You're so smart.

381
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,750
She is super smart.

382
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:36,250
Yes. Yes, you're so smart.

383
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:39,041
Are you tired, too?
A little--

384
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,041
well, it's because you're gonna
run the world someday.

385
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,375
I know.
It's true.

386
00:17:43,417 --> 00:17:46,041
All right, it's my
turn. My turn, my turn, my turn.

387
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,667
That's your auntie vi. Yeah.
Oh, I miss
Lucas being this little.

388
00:17:48,709 --> 00:17:50,792
Is Charlotte coming?
No.
She declined, but gracefully.

389
00:17:50,834 --> 00:17:53,166
Yes, she's speaking
in bumper sticker slogans,

390
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,041
which either means
she's internalized

391
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,583
the help
that we've been offering her...
Or we need start

392
00:17:57,625 --> 00:18:00,041
planning escape routes
in case she goes postal.

393
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,208
Okay, okay, my turn again.
Come on.
All right.

394
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:05,500
Yes, the sweetest girl.

395
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:08,375
Hi. Hi.
Hi. There you are.

396
00:18:08,417 --> 00:18:10,667
Hi, sweetie.
Oh, she is so gorgeous.

397
00:18:10,709 --> 00:18:15,291
Yes, you are.
You are gorgeous, little girl.

398
00:18:16,917 --> 00:18:18,667
Okay, that's it.

399
00:18:18,709 --> 00:18:20,667
Where you going?
No offense,

400
00:18:20,709 --> 00:18:22,917
but I did not come here
for "the vagina monologues."

401
00:18:22,959 --> 00:18:25,500
What?
What?

402
00:18:25,542 --> 00:18:27,542
Oh, not
"the vagina monologues."

403
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:30,250
Did you ever think
we'd be these women--

404
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,458
passing around a baby
like it's good drugs?

405
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,041
Being the kind of women that
women like Amelia run from?

406
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,709
I was always,
always this woman.

407
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,417
I want a baby.

408
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:43,083
Yes, I do. I do.

409
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:46,375
It's probably
not gonna happen for me, though.

410
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,375
No, it's not.

411
00:18:48,417 --> 00:18:50,667

and one sad--

412
00:18:50,709 --> 00:18:52,250
Yes...

414
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:57,041

00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:58,500
No.

416
00:18:58,542 --> 00:19:00,625

any more children.

with him.

She's a good one.

Violet. That's enough.
Come on. Let's go.

She's worth way more
than $250.

673
