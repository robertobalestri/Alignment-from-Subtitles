I was just--i-i was in therapy,
and I just started.

41
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:51,542
And I keep a journal
on the computer, and I was

42
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:54,041
writing everything down
because it made me feel less,

43
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:56,041
um, you know, less like
someone cut a baby out of me.

44
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,500
And, uh, so I just kept writing,
and then this one day,

45
00:01:58,542 --> 00:02:00,542
I, uh, I printed it out
to see what it was.

46
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:02,542
And I was standing by
the printer, and I'm thinking,

47
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:04,542
well, this is just gonna be
a couple of pages,

48
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,667
but the printer kept printing
and printing and printing.

49
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:09,250
And then it turns out it wasn't
a couple of pages.

50
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:11,250
It was, uh, 837 pages.
And I have this friend

51
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:13,250
in New York
who works in publishing,

52
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:15,500

you know, just to see.

53
00:02:15,542 --> 00:02:17,500
And I didn't tell Pete.
I didn't tell anybody

54
00:02:17,542 --> 00:02:19,500

was gonna happen with it.

55
00:02:19,542 --> 00:02:22,125

00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:51,041
Or what if she just doesn't...
Want to again, ever?

174
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,709
Well, h--
have you talked about it?

175
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,667
No.
Have you been talking
at all?

176
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,667
Well...
No, not really.

177
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:00,667
I never know what to say,

178
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:03,667
and when I do say something,
it feels like the wrong thing.
Uh...

179
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:07,333
I hate to tell you, you need
to walk before you run,

180
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:10,333
but, uh, uh, I mean,
if you're not even...
Crawling yet?

181
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:11,750
Exactly.

182
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:17,709
She needs to be comfortable,
Cooper. So do you.

183
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,333
So just, uh...

184
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,000
Ease back into it.

185
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:33,125
Dr. Rodriguez,
thank you for coming.

186
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,500
No problem.
What do you have for me?

187
00:08:35,542 --> 00:08:37,500
Tell me what you see.

188
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:39,709
There are lesions
on both ovaries.

189
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,083
Evidence
of lymphatic involvement.

190
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:45,041
And there is an irregularity
on the liver edge.
Is there anything
that we can do

191
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,041
that would make
a meaningful difference?

192
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:50,041
Well... at first glance,
I would say no.

193
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,041
I-Is she--

194
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,208
oh, it's my mother's,
uh, friend...

195
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,125
Very close friend.
It's her lover.

196
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:02,041
There has to be something
that we can do.

197
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,959
My mother's not a person
who takes no for an answer.

198
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,834
I can do some research,
consult with my colleagues.
Thank you.

199
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,583
Yeah.
Thanks.

200
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,583
I have to admit,
when you called,

201
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,583
I was hoping you were
finally gonna say yes

202
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,291
to dinner with me.

203
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,875
Uh, no.

204
00:09:17,917 --> 00:09:20,000
It was the scans
that I wanted you for--

205
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:22,750
to see.

206
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,917
That's interesting.

207
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,250
What?
What are you thinking?

208
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,250
Corey's wife is wrong
to withhold treatment.

209
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,458
This is not a death sentence.

210
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,041
His life will be different,
yeah, but at least--
but that is not for us
to determine, is it?

211
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,667
Look, I'm not saying that i'd
be ready to off myself,

212
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:42,041
but if something happened
and I couldn't cut anymore,

213
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:45,000
I-I don't know
what I would do.
So Corey's not gonna change
the world on an epic scale.

214
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:47,375
He'll still be able to walk,
be able to hold his grandkids.

215
00:09:47,417 --> 00:09:49,750
Life isn't all about
achievements and work.
For you.

216
00:09:49,792 --> 00:09:52,041
You paged me?
Yeah, I need your help.

217
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,417
I've already been briefed.

218
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:56,291
The wife's within her rights
to deny medical care.

219
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,542
So if you go digging
in Mr. Ramsey's brain

220
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,542
because you think
she's making the wrong choice,

221
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,709
you are opening us up
to a wrongful life suit.

222
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,667
Excuse me. I-I'm looking
for Corey Ramsey.
And you are?

223
00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:11,458
I'm janel chase.
I'm his girlfriend.

224
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,667
Go away.

225
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,959
What page are you on?

226
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,166
Oh, go away, Violet.
I beg of you, please.

227
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,458
Is it bad?
It's bad, isn't it?

228
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,375
It's uninteresting,
flowery, self-indulgent--

229
00:10:35,417 --> 00:10:37,375
Go away!

230
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,583
Rodriguez thinks
I should scope Susan.

231
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,709
Wait. I thought you both agreed
that there was nothing to do.
Well, looking at the scans,

232
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,709
he wasn't sure
of the liver involvement.

233
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,542
So I'd like to get in there
and see if it's possible

234
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,583
that surgery will help--
that's just
desperation talking.

235
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,583
You know
what the answer's gonna be.

236
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:00,041
This is exactly why doctors
should never operate on family.

237
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:04,041
It's a bad idea.
You didn't object
when I operated on Maya.

238
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,792
That was an emergency.
This is bizzy.

239
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Hi.
Hey.

240
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,375
Uh...

241
00:11:12,417 --> 00:11:15,834
So you and I...

242
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,041
We're not, um...
We're not having sex.

243
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,041
And I get that.

244
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:23,208
I'm not even sure if you really
want me to touch you at all,

245
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,208
which is fine.
I understand that.

246
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,375
I do wish that we could
at least talk about it.

247
00:11:28,417 --> 00:11:30,375
Or just talk at all.

248
00:11:30,417 --> 00:11:32,041
But maybe talking--

249
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,041
maybe we're not there yet.

250
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,625
Um...

251
00:11:35,667 --> 00:11:38,125
But we're gonna
have to get there,

252
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,542
to a talking place.

253
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:43,333
Anyway, you have to eat,
and so do I.

254
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:46,041
So I canceled a couple
of patients today.

255
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,041
I drove out to glendale
where they have

256
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,041
what is supposed to be
the greatest fried chicken

257
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,834
in southern California.

258
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:54,041
And fried chicken
is your favorite.

259
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:57,041
Yeah. I don't know.

260
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,125
This sounded better
in my head,

261
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:02,166
but I thought maybe
we could just sit here

262
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,250
and not talk

263
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:07,166
and... eat fried chicken

264
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,709
and wait for the talking place
to come.

265
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:17,041
You want to eat
fried chicken with me?

266
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,458
I want to eat
fried chicken with you.

267
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,250
Okay.

268
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,458
Mm-hmm.
Uh-huh.

269
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,750
Mmm.

270
00:12:46,792 --> 00:12:49,041
Mmm.

271
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,667
I think we should try it...

272
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:54,667
Having sex.

273
00:12:54,709 --> 00:12:56,458
Mm.

274
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,208
Tonight.

275
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,291
You okay?

276
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,083
Mm.

277
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,917
We met four years ago.

278
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,333
He didn't tell me
he was married right away.

279
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:20,333
I didn't even know
what he did for a living

280
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,375
until I saw him on TV.

281
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:24,375
I just knew he was a big...

282
00:13:24,417 --> 00:13:27,709
A big sweet kid.

283
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,542
I love him.
And Patricia?

284
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:33,041
She doesn't know
anything about me.
Oh.

285
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:35,333
Um, I know I shouldn't be here,
but...

286
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:37,083
Is he gonna be okay?

287
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:40,166
I'm sorry. We can't give you
that information.

288
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,792
You're not Corey's wife.

289
00:13:41,834 --> 00:13:43,834
We're running out of time.
He needs surgery.

290
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,542
So w-what are you
waiting for?

291
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,000
Patricia wants to manage
the swelling with drugs

292
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,917
in hopes that Corey
will heal naturally

293
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:51,917
and regain
his full brain function.

294
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:54,917
And will he?
 He should have the operation.

295
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,417
And then he'll be fine?

296
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:01,083
His mental capacity
will be diminished.

297
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:04,917
He's not gonna be the Corey
that you know, a genius. He--

298
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,917
that's not the Corey I know.

299
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,166
W--and if the drugs
don't work?

300
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:12,041
He'll die.

301
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,750
I don't get why Patricia
would want that.

302
00:14:14,792 --> 00:14:16,667
She says that she's
respecting his wishes.

303
00:14:16,709 --> 00:14:19,667
As his doctors, we can't--
no, Corey would not
want to die.

304
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:21,041
I know that.

305
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:24,041
His work, that's just stress.
He--please.

306
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,250
You can't let her kill him.

307
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,834
It's good.
It's brilliant.

308
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,041
Yeah. Brilliant.
Brilliant is the word.

309
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,041
The way you discuss
the attack, I cried.

310
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,208
It's compelling, emotional.
Yeah.

311
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:42,208
I think it's gonna help
a lot of people.
It's a beautiful memoir.

312
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,417
Yay.

313
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,041
I'm gonna--
I'm gonna show Pete.

314
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:50,250
Pete is going to love it.

315
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,041
I gotta do friend duty.

316
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,875
Addison's mother?

317
00:14:55,917 --> 00:14:58,417
Yeah, yeah. I don't know
who's gonna die first--

318
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:01,500
Susan from the cancer or Addison
from trying to save her.

319
00:15:01,542 --> 00:15:03,500
Hey, Violet,
nice work.

320
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:07,000
When you're on Oprah,

321
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,625
and she's telling the world
how brilliant your book is,

322
00:15:09,667 --> 00:15:12,375
try to find a way to work
my name into the conversation.

323
00:15:12,417 --> 00:15:15,000
You know, I'd like to hear
Oprah say my name.

324
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,458
I don't think
I've ever seen you scared.

325
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,041
I'm not scared.

326
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,041
A little.
I'm a little scared.

327
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,875
It's an impossible situation,
Addie.

328
00:15:22,917 --> 00:15:25,458
Everybody can recognize that.
Everyone except bizzy,
of course.

329
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,041
Well, she's a smart woman.
She's an irrational woman.

330
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,667
Then don't do it. Stand up
to her. You're an adult.

331
00:15:30,709 --> 00:15:33,667
It's not like your relationship
can get any worse.
You're right.

332
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:36,041
So you gonna talk to her?

333
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,500

418
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,041
The truth is,

419
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:49,083
even if she suffered through
all of it, she'd have less than

420
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:52,041

No.

No, what?
No, I don't accept
your numbers

424
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:04,166

They're not my numbers,

425
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,375
I don't want 25%.
I don't want 50%.

426
00:20:06,417 --> 00:20:08,583
I want a cure,
plain and simple.

427
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,792
I don't care what it costs.

428
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:14,041
Do you understand that?
I'm sorry.
We can't offer you that.

429
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,875
I expected more from--
what exactly did you expect
from me, bizzy?

430
00:20:16,917 --> 00:20:19,250

more than a passive spectator

don't.

434

00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,208

437
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,250
I want to have sex.

438
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:51,417
I think. I'm not sure.

439
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,291
Maybe I want to have sex.

440
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:57,208
I-I love sex.
I'm good at sex.

441
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:02,250
And what...

442
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:05,041
What that man did to me...

443
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,208
Wasn't sex.

444
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,875
So...

445
00:21:09,917 --> 00:21:12,667
This shouldn't be a problem.

446
00:21:12,709 --> 00:21:14,500
I am...

447
00:21:14,542 --> 00:21:17,041
Good at sex.

448
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:23,125
So how come I'm crying
when Cooper touches me?

449
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:25,458
Charlotte...
You were raped.

450
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,041
I know that.

451
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:31,041
But it wasn't Cooper
who raped me.

452
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,792

454
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:36,917

Not guilty,
not vulnerable...

457
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:45,625
But strong.

458
00:21:47,542 --> 00:21:50,291
Sex for me and Coop,
it's like, uh...

459
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,917
It's how we communicate.

460
00:21:52,959 --> 00:21:56,041
I hate using the phrase
"making love," but...

461
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,166
It's what it is.

462
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:01,417
It's how we love.

463
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:04,375
And I want that back.

464
00:22:04,417 --> 00:22:06,583
Do you?

465
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:10,166
What's that supposed to mean?

466
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:12,166
Look, y-you don't want
a hug,

467
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:14,834
and I promise you, I am--
I'm not gonna hug you.

468
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:18,041
But I-I am gonna tell you
what you and I both know.

469
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:21,041
Love and intimacy
and pleasure...

470
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:24,166
No one can take those things
away from you.

471
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:25,792

what they've done to you.

473
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:33,583
Nothing can come between
you and Cooper except you.

474
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:45,041
Bizzy, what you're doing
to Addison is wrong.

475
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:47,959
It's unfair,
and I'm not gonna...

476
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:57,834
I ask very little
of my children.

477
00:22:57,875 --> 00:23:00,458
But what I'm asking
of Addison...

478
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,458
It's not lost on me.

479
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:15,875
It doesn't look like

480
00:23:15,917 --> 00:23:18,083
there's anything left
to be done.

481
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:20,834
I'm sorry.

482
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:22,250
I really am.

483
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:26,834
But you...

484
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:29,834
You can't
keep pushing Addison.

485
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,834
For whatever is left
of your relationship with her,

486
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,208
bizzy, please...

487
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:37,041
Don't do this.

488
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,792
Susan means...

489
00:23:39,834 --> 00:23:41,834
Everything to me,

490
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:43,917
and she's...

491
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:50,041
And I have to believe

492
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:52,041
that there is
some way to help her.

493
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:53,542
That's why I came here,

494
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:56,333
because Addison is the best
at what she does, the very best.

495
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:59,083
Well, have you ever
told her that?

496
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:02,000
I'm her mother.
That's not my job.

497
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:17,458
I-I know
I shouldn't be in here,

498
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:21,041
but... I saw
that Patricia had stepped out.

499
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:23,000
Stay.

500
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:30,000
How is he?

501
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:33,041
His intracranial pressure
is holding for now.

502
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:34,917
He doesn't have to die.

503
00:24:34,959 --> 00:24:37,917
I respect that
it's her decision to make,

504
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:41,083
but Corey says they barely
even talk anymore.

505
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:43,041
I'm sorry.
I wish...

506
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:46,041

Who are you?

509
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:03,792
I'm begging you.
You can't do this to him.

510
00:25:03,834 --> 00:25:06,625
You can't let him die.
Why is sh--who are you?

511
00:25:06,667 --> 00:25:09,834
Janel, maybe it's best
that you go.
I love him, too.
Let him live.

512
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:12,834
Let him decide
if he wants to live.
Get out.

513
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:18,500
What's happening?
His I.C.P.
Is going through the roof.

514
00:25:18,542 --> 00:25:21,208
I'm gonna increase his mannitol.
Nurse, I need

515
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:24,041
a ventriculostomy kit, asap.
Okay, hold on to him.

516
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:27,041
Patricia, if I don't insert
a tube into his head

517
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:29,041
to relieve the pressure,
he's gonna die...

518
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:31,041
Right here, right now.

519
00:25:31,083 --> 00:25:34,041
I need you to tell me
this is okay.

520
00:25:34,083 --> 00:25:36,250
What the hell's going on
in here?

521
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:39,041
Did you authorize this?
Authorize? He's dying.

522
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:41,417
Patricia--
you can't just do this
without her permission.

523
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:44,959
She can sue if she wants.
I'm saving his life.

524
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,041
You okay?

525
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:52,125
For a passive spectator.
Oh, Addison--

526
00:25:52,166 --> 00:25:53,750
I can't win here.

527
00:25:53,792 --> 00:25:56,125
If I don't do something,
bizzy will hate me.

528
00:25:56,166 --> 00:25:59,041
And if I do and get anything
less than some miracle result,

529
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:01,041
then she's still
gonna hate me.

530
00:26:01,083 --> 00:26:04,041
I don't think so. I think
she just wants you to try.

531
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:07,041
She believes in you.
Yeah, well, she has
a funny way of showing it.

532
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:09,041
No, no, she--she came here
because she knew

533
00:26:09,083 --> 00:26:12,083
the only thing that could help
Susan would be a miracle.

534
00:26:12,125 --> 00:26:14,083
And she believes
that if anyone's

535
00:26:14,125 --> 00:26:17,709
gonna give her a miracle,
you can.
Why are you suddenly
on her side?

536
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,709
Because she was crying.

537
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,917
What?

538
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:22,041
Yeah.

539
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:23,083
B--

540
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:25,041
bizzy does not cry.

541
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:29,041
Is there a part of you
that doesn't want to try

542
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:32,041
because...
You hate your mother

543
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:34,250
for not being a mother?
What? What--no, that's not--

544
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:36,333
why would you even
say something like that?

545
00:26:36,375 --> 00:26:39,041
Because you are
Addison Forbes Montgomery...

546
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:42,041
World-class surgeon.

547
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:44,041
And I have never, ever

548
00:26:44,083 --> 00:26:46,166
seen you back away
from a fight.

549
00:26:52,542 --> 00:26:54,625
Our biggest problem
is that the cancer

550
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:56,625
has metastasized
to areas of your body

551
00:26:56,667 --> 00:26:58,625
that are either too dangerous
for me to cut

552
00:26:58,667 --> 00:27:00,709
or too difficult
for me to reach.

553
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:03,291
But, um...
I did some research,

554
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:06,041
and I found a new protocol.
I...

555
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:08,667
I was trained on this machine.
It's called the Da Vinci.

556
00:27:08,709 --> 00:27:11,250
You're gonna let a machine
operate on me?

557
00:27:11,291 --> 00:27:13,250
No, no, no. I would
operate on you,

558
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:15,458
but I would be doing it
using the machine.

559
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,458
It enables me to cut in ways

560
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,542
that I would never
be able to do freehand.

561
00:27:19,583 --> 00:27:21,583
Have you ever done this
before?

562
00:27:21,625 --> 00:27:24,667
It's generally not used
on cases like yours yet,

563
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:26,667
but I know its capabilities,

564
00:27:26,709 --> 00:27:29,583
and I think it's
the best way to help you.

565
00:27:29,625 --> 00:27:31,291
Hmm.

566
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,709
If it weren't
for your mother,

567
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:40,000
I don't think I ever
would've come here.

568
00:27:40,041 --> 00:27:41,542
But I love her.

569
00:27:41,583 --> 00:27:44,667
She's my best friend.

570
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:49,041
I want to do it...

571
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:51,041
For her.

572
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:57,417
Hey, bizzy.

573
00:27:57,458 --> 00:28:00,417
So you have a plan now.

574
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:04,750
So is there gonna be--there's
gonna be, like, a book tour?

575
00:28:04,792 --> 00:28:07,291
Like 12 cities, 10 days,
readings, autographs?

576
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:09,959
Oh, if they do, can i--
can I be a roadie?

577
00:28:10,041 --> 00:28:12,250
What would you do?
Nanny.

578
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:14,417
Oh.
You want to go
on the road with mommy?

579
00:28:14,458 --> 00:28:16,625
Huh?
Oh.

580
00:28:16,667 --> 00:28:19,041
Aren't you so proud
of her?

581
00:28:19,083 --> 00:28:22,333
Oh, my god. One day,
he's gonna know how to read.

582
00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:25,458
Oh, no, no. Don't go there.
No, he's gonna know
all the most intimate details

583
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,333
of his mother's life.
Mm.

584
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:29,041
And my parents and you...

585
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:31,417
It's a book, Violet.
It's not a sex tape.

586
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:34,250
But still--
no buts.
You coulda taken those pages

587
00:28:34,291 --> 00:28:36,417
and stuffed 'em in a drawer
somewhere, but you didn't.

588
00:28:36,458 --> 00:28:39,458
You sent 'em off to see
if anybody would care,

589
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,625
and they will.
People will care.

590
00:28:41,667 --> 00:28:43,959
They will be helped
by what you wrote.

591
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,500
Are you sure?
No, not at all.
You haven't let me read it.

592
00:28:46,542 --> 00:28:49,041
No, I mean, you know...

593
00:28:49,083 --> 00:28:50,417
I'm kidding.

594
00:28:50,458 --> 00:28:53,417
I'm sure it's honest
and real and it's you.

595
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:55,625
You did a good thing.

596
00:28:57,542 --> 00:28:59,917
Oh, you could kiss me
right now, couldn't you?

597
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:03,625
Do you need a kiss?
Oh, I need more than a kiss.

598
00:29:03,667 --> 00:29:05,041
I know.

599
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:08,000
I'm sorry
it's so difficult, Coop.

600
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:14,625
I need you.

601
00:29:14,667 --> 00:29:16,041
You had your chance.

602
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:18,667
I'm going to use
the Da Vinci surgical system

603
00:29:18,709 --> 00:29:20,458
on Susan tomorrow.

604
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,458
I applaud your ambition,
but your judgment is--

605
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,083
it's possible.
Anything is possible.
The question is,

606
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:29,083
are you gonna be selling Susan
and your mother false hope?

607
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:31,709
Well, if I were doing it
on my own, probably,

608
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:34,041
but that's where you come in.

609
00:29:34,083 --> 00:29:36,041
I need you to infuse
heated chemo

610
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:38,750
directly into her abdomen
after I cut.

611
00:29:38,792 --> 00:29:40,458
It'll destroy any disease
left behind.

612
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,709
Don't play hard to get.
You are.

613
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:46,625
I'll see you tomorrow?

614
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:03,542
Ahh.

615
00:30:03,583 --> 00:30:05,041
Good night.

616
00:30:05,083 --> 00:30:06,917
Good night.

617
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:10,959
Mm.

618
00:30:12,417 --> 00:30:14,917
Mm.

619
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:25,834
Mm.

620
00:30:45,083 --> 00:30:46,750
You okay?

621
00:30:46,792 --> 00:30:48,125
I am.

622
00:30:48,166 --> 00:30:50,333
You sure?

623
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:06,125
What?

624
00:31:06,166 --> 00:31:07,750
What's wrong?

625
00:31:07,792 --> 00:31:08,959
Nothing.

626
00:31:10,667 --> 00:31:12,875
I'm fine, Cooper.

627
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:19,625
What is it?

628
00:31:19,667 --> 00:31:22,208
I just--
I want it to be right.

629
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:24,041
It's not my first time.

00:35:07,125 --> 00:35:10,041
When you got raped,

695
00:35:10,083 --> 00:35:12,750
how long before
you wanted to screw again?

696
00:35:12,792 --> 00:35:15,208
Wow.

697
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:19,417
Uh, well, you could read
all about it in my book

698
00:35:19,458 --> 00:35:21,417
if I was publishing
my book.

699
00:35:21,458 --> 00:35:23,417
I don't want to have
a heart-to-heart

700
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:26,041
or hear about your problems.
I just want an answer.

701
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:27,500
Okay. Um...

702
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:30,875
Well, I guess...

703
00:35:33,083 --> 00:35:35,917
For me,
it was a long time...

704
00:35:35,959 --> 00:35:40,250
Because I had to learn
how to trust men again.

705
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:44,041
But I was single,
you know?

706
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:46,041
I mean, if I had already

707
00:35:46,083 --> 00:35:48,959
had a man in my life
that I trusted,

708
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,250
I don't know.

709
00:35:51,291 --> 00:35:53,250
I do know that the fact

710
00:35:53,291 --> 00:35:55,583
that you're asking yourself
this question

711
00:35:55,625 --> 00:35:57,583
probably means
you're more ready

712
00:35:57,625 --> 00:36:00,041
than you think you are.

713
00:36:00,083 --> 00:36:02,750
Just take it slow.

714
00:36:02,792 --> 00:36:04,208
Okay.

715
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,208
Thank you.

716
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,417
I never said that.

717
00:36:11,458 --> 00:36:14,417
And I'm mean to you
a lot of the time

718
00:36:14,458 --> 00:36:17,041
'cause you're all touchy-feely,
and that's annoying,

719
00:36:17,083 --> 00:36:19,959
but... you told me
about your rape.

720
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,041
And that...

721
00:36:22,083 --> 00:36:24,208
Helped me.

722
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:27,291
It helped me.

723
00:36:27,333 --> 00:36:30,041
Thank you.

724
00:36:48,083 --> 00:36:50,041
We got it... all of it.

725
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:53,041
And we were able to insert
the port in her abdomen

726
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:56,041
to deliver the local chemo.
I mean, we still have to
monitor her,

727
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:58,000
but it looks
very promising.

728
00:37:11,041 --> 00:37:13,625
I should be with Susan.

729
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:29,041
Mrs. Ramsey.

730
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:31,500
The cerebral edema
is improving,

731
00:37:31,542 --> 00:37:34,417
and Corey's pupils
are reactive.

732
00:37:34,458 --> 00:37:36,417
We had to remove

733
00:37:36,458 --> 00:37:40,041
a larger portion of the brain
than we expected.

734
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:42,458
- Is he...
- He's responding.

735
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,041
That's all we know.

736
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:47,667
It's gonna be
a... a long road back.

737
00:37:47,709 --> 00:37:49,333
Can I see...

738
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,583
Can we see him,
the--the two of us?

739
00:37:56,667 --> 00:37:58,667
Of course.

740
00:38:10,959 --> 00:38:13,041
She just walked away.

741
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:14,667
Well...

742
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:17,000
Her husband's
not in there.

743
00:38:21,917 --> 00:38:24,041
Hey. How'd it go?

744
00:38:24,083 --> 00:38:26,542
She kicked ass.
That's great.

745
00:38:26,583 --> 00:38:30,041
But bizzy
didn't say thank you.

746
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:32,375
Oh, come on.
We are all family here.

747
00:38:32,417 --> 00:38:34,375
I'm sorry.
That... that sucks.

748
00:38:34,417 --> 00:38:37,000
Shame on me
for expecting more.

749
00:38:37,041 --> 00:38:39,041
No, shame on you for turning

750
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:41,583
what should be a celebration
into this.

751
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:43,792
You know what?
You're right.

752
00:38:43,834 --> 00:38:47,208
Bizzy's just bizzy.

753
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:49,208
Look, I have
an amazing mother.

754
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:51,208
All right? I have
a kick-ass mom.

755
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,417
I have the best mom
in the world.

756
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:57,291
Ahh. Yay, you.
But I have a dead father,
and a drug addiction problem,

757
00:38:57,333 --> 00:38:59,834
and I'm kind of a whore.

758
00:38:59,875 --> 00:39:03,041
Nai is a great mom, and she
has a 15 year old with a baby.

759
00:39:03,083 --> 00:39:06,542
Is there a point
to all this?
Yes.

760
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:09,417
You have a cold,
withholding mother.

761
00:39:09,458 --> 00:39:12,041
And you're the most competent,
together person I know.

762
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:14,041
I-I wanna be you
when I grow up.

763
00:39:14,083 --> 00:39:16,041
So, you know,
maybe you got dealt

764
00:39:16,083 --> 00:39:18,834
the better hand
in the long run.

765
00:39:18,875 --> 00:39:21,041
So just shut up
and stop whining.

766
00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:28,041
She's a little bit wise.

767
00:39:28,083 --> 00:39:29,625
It's annoying.

If you want something

you're gonna
have to ask for it.
