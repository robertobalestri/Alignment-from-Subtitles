Have you been to see Brett
this week?

18
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:52,166
It's a long drive out there,

19
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:55,667
and I don't have a lot
of spare time these days.

20
00:00:55,709 --> 00:00:58,667
It's hard to even take
the hour to come here.

21
00:00:58,709 --> 00:01:02,041
I-I would think seeing Brett
this week would be a priority.

22
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:04,041
Then you don't understand
my priorities.

23
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:06,166
Hilary, I seem to be
irritating you today.

24
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:08,166
Am I irritating you?

25
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:11,291
What's your position
on the death penalty?

26
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:13,458
Well, i-I'd like to keep
the focus on you--

27
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,583
I know. All you shrinks prefer
to keep the focus on me.

28
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:18,041
I know
that's your preference.

29
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:19,875
But I'd still like you
to tell me

30
00:01:19,917 --> 00:01:21,875
your position
on the death penalty,

31
00:01:21,917 --> 00:01:23,875
because in 48 hours,
the state plans

32
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,291
to hang an innocent man
in the public square.

33
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:29,291
That's what they're gonna do.
Even if they've planned to do it

34
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:31,959
with a table and a needle in his
vein, it's no less barbaric.

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,041
And you seem to want me to
give over to that, to give up,

36
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:37,041
to spend hours
crying in my husband's lap--

37
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:40,041
hours that could be spent
on the phone

38
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:42,500
to the governor's office
trying to save his life.

39
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,750
I honestly don't even
understand that.

40
00:01:47,792 --> 00:01:50,542
I just want you
to get some closure.

41
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:52,500
You want me to give up.

42
00:01:52,542 --> 00:01:54,542
That's not a thing
I'm ever gonna do.

43
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,458
I haven't heard
from my wife this week.

44
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,959
I understand
she's fighting hard

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,291
to get another stay.

46
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:05,375
My son stopped by to see me.
How was that?

47
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:08,500
Um, he was 9 months old
when I went away,

48
00:02:08,542 --> 00:02:11,500
and now he's got facial hair
and an attitude.

49
00:02:11,542 --> 00:02:13,500
Hard to be
any kind of decent father

50
00:02:13,542 --> 00:02:16,166
from death row.

51
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:18,792
Are you afraid that's
the last time you'll see him?

52
00:02:18,834 --> 00:02:20,375
I'm not afraid.

53
00:02:20,417 --> 00:02:22,291
I'm not afraid to die.

54
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:25,041
Is that
what you told your son?

55
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:28,041
I told him... that he should
go take a drive.

56
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:29,542
You know, just...

57
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,041
He should go take a road trip
with his friends.

58
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:35,500
His mother and I...
Don't want him here this week

59
00:02:35,542 --> 00:02:36,959
for...

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,500
He believes his father is...

61
00:02:39,542 --> 00:02:41,417
Being wrongfully executed.

62
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:44,125
How does a kid
forgive the world after that?

63
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,125
How does he make anything
of himself

64
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,083
when he believes
that's the way the world works?

65
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,542
That's an interesting choice
of words. "He believes."

66
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,583
You've maintained
your innocence for 17 years.

67
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,583
We've worked together
for several months.

68
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:57,417
You've never said anything
like...

69
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm guilty.

70
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:07,166
I did it, Dr. Wallace.
I'm guilty as sin.

71
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,625
Your wife doesn't know.

72
00:03:15,667 --> 00:03:18,667
No. My wife, my son--
they believe me.

73
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:21,417
He doesn't know me
except in prison,

74
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:23,625
so he believes his mother,
and hilary...

75
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:27,458
She knew me for a long time
before I was in here.

76
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,458
We've been together
since high school.

77
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,458
I was 27
when they put me away.

78
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,542
She's never heard me
raise my voice let alone a gun.

79
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,542
I never raised a hand
to anybody.

80
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,542
So, uh...
What happened?

81
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:42,041
I snapped.

82
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:44,291
That's about all I can say
to that.

83
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,041
I met a guy in a bar

84
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,917
who was rude, disrespectful.

85
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:51,917
Followed him home,
saw where he lived,

86
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:54,917
and I went blind. You know
the phrase "seeing red"?

87
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,208
It's like
something inside me broke.

88
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:03,166
We kept a gun in the house
for protection.

89
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:06,250
I went home, I got the gun,
I went back to Mr. Miller's,

90
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,041
and I shot him.

91
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:11,875
And never in a million years...

92
00:04:11,917 --> 00:04:13,709
Would hilary ever believe

93
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,709
that I would do something
like that.

94
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,750
I don't even
believe it myself.

95
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:22,125
Do you want to tell her?

96
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:25,041
Do you want her to know?
No, I don't want to tell her.

97
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:27,875
But I don't want her

98
00:04:27,917 --> 00:04:30,542
to spend any more of her life
hating the world.

99
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:33,041
And I don't want that
for my son.

100
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:36,667
It's better that they hate me
than hate the world.

101
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,542
Don't you think?

102
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,750
It was creepy.

103
00:04:43,792 --> 00:04:45,125
She's grieving.

104
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,166
No, I-I get grieving.
I-I get that.

105
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,291
This--this I don't get.
It was creepy.

106
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,959
Was she like,
"you don't have to come,"

107
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,333
or was she like, you know,
"don't come"?
She didn't
say anything really.

108
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:57,041
She didn't even look at me.
It was like Addison

109
00:04:57,083 --> 00:05:01,041
was taken over by the ghost
of her cold and waspy mother.

110
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:04,500
It was creepy.
 Why aren't you in Connecticut with Addison?

111
00:05:04,542 --> 00:05:07,667
She told me
I didn't have to come.
Oh. In all those years
of marriage,

112
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:10,667
did I really
teach you nothing?
So you're saying now
I should have gone anyway?

113
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:12,875
Yes, you moron.
You shoulda gone.

114
00:05:12,917 --> 00:05:15,083
But you didn't,
so you should go now.

115
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,291
We should all go.

116
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,709
W-Wait, all--who all?
Yeah, you know, Charlotte's
not gonna want to go.

117
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,375
Go where?
Connecticut
to support Addison.

118
00:05:22,417 --> 00:05:24,625
Oh, we should absolutely go.

119
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:27,625
When big daddy died, you came.
It meant everything to me.

120
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:30,291
We should all get on a plane
as soon as possible.

121
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,291
Hey. How did things go
with hilary?

122
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:35,166
As well as can be expected.
I'm gonna check tickets
and hotel rooms.

123
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:37,417
- I fly first class.
- Yeah, me--me, too.

124
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:40,291
Wh--tickets?
We're talking about going
to be with Addison.

125
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,291
Oh. Oh, god. I can't go.

126
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,417
My, um, my patient's husband
is, uh,

127
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,625
well, if he doesn't get
a stay,

128
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:48,625
he will be executed
in the next 48 hours,

129
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:52,083
so I need to be here.
I'm sorry, you guys. You're
just gonna have to survive

130
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,458
without us.
Oh, no. Pete, you should go.

131
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:02,000
Okay, what--
what just happened?

132
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,208
The mailbox is
in a different zip code.

133
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,792
That's not normal.
Nothing about these people
is normal.

134
00:06:35,834 --> 00:06:39,208
It's amazing Addison turned out
so relatively sane.

135
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,875
You say that now.
Wait.

136
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,250
Hello. Thank you for coming.

137
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:55,041
Look, we, uh, we didn't mean
to ambush you or anything.

138
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,458
We just wanted to be here
for you.

139
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,625
Of course. How lovely.
Won't you come in for a drink?

140
00:07:01,667 --> 00:07:04,750
Oh, yeah.
Totally creepy.

141
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,542
A few of bizzy's friends
stopped by

142
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,625
to pay their respects.

143
00:07:16,667 --> 00:07:18,959
Which means gossip
and drink our booze.

144
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,625
Hi. It's good to see you all.
Thank you for coming.

145
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:24,291
Of course.

146
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:27,041
- Uh, is Violet...
- Uh, not here.

147
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:30,333
She had an emergency at work.
Shame.

148
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,875
Sends her best.
Well, if it isn't

149
00:07:32,917 --> 00:07:34,917
the entire cast
of "the tan and the beautiful."

150
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,583
God, I miss California.

151
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,500
Hello, beautiful.

152
00:07:40,542 --> 00:07:42,250
Hello, Archer.

153
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,041
Thanks for coming.

154
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:45,917
My mother died. Be nice.

155
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,917
Given that
the last time I saw you,

156
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:50,166
you climbed out of my bed
and disappeared--
bygones. Dead mother.

157
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,500
Mm-hmm.
Come on. Give me something.

158
00:07:52,542 --> 00:07:55,291
I'm here, aren't I?
We should, uh, probably
get back to the hotel.

159
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:58,291
Oh, no. We have
plenty of rooms here.
No, no, Archer.
That's not necessary.

160
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,959
No, I'm grieving. It's decided.
You're all staying.

161
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,375
I don't mean to be
rude, but we have to sit down

162
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:05,750
for a meeting
with the funeral director.
Ahh.

163
00:08:05,792 --> 00:08:09,125
Go ahead. We--we can--
we can take care of ourselves.
You'll have to pour
your own drinks.

164
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,959
The house has been closed
since bizzy left.

165
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,041
Pour our own drinks? Shame.

166
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,959
Hey.

167
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,458
Hey.

168
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,750
I know
you didn't want me to come,

169
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:25,542
but I'm happy to see you.

170
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,375
Thank you.

171
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,583
He did it?
I was his therapist
for four months.

172
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,083
I believed he was innocent.

173
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,083
How do you think
it makes me feel about me?

174
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,709
So I-I have a patient

175
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,041
who has spent
the last 17 years of her life,

176
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,125
full-time, fighting
for her husband's freedom.

177
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,125
You should hear her
go on about this case.

178
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,667
She can tell you the exact
number of white pickup trucks

179
00:08:47,709 --> 00:08:49,333
registered in California
in '94.

180
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:52,125
She can tell you the exact
number of 38-caliber handguns.

181
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,125
She can tell you the name
and cell phone number

182
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,583
of every gubernatorial aide
who's worked in this state

183
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:59,166
for the past 20 years.
Look, I understand,
believe me.

184
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:02,041
It isn't right. I mean, if he
wants to clear his conscience

185
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,875
at the eleventh hour, then let
him talk to you, not to her.

186
00:09:04,917 --> 00:09:07,000
He doesn't get
to unburden himself

187
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,750
at the expense of her sanity.
And you don't think
she deserves to know the truth?

188
00:09:09,792 --> 00:09:12,750
I think she deserves
a little peace.
And you think she's gonna
get that, when her husband,

189
00:09:12,792 --> 00:09:15,250
an innocent man, dies
at the hands of the state?

190
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:18,041
My client asked me to talk
to you and then to his wife

191
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,041
on his behalf.
He's a dying man,

192
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,917
and I find myself inclined
to honor his request.

193
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,917
He is a dying murderer
who's been lying

194
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,166
to those who love him
for nearly 20 years.
Well, be that as it may--

195
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,083
all right. Let me spend
some time with her.

196
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,083
Let me spend some time
on her turf, and, uh,

197
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:34,083
and I will get back to you with
my professional recommendation.

198
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:38,041
Let's keep the emphasis
on "professional."
You know what?
It's comments like that--

199
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,417
that's why
you have trouble with women.

200
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,000
In lieu of flowers,
Mrs. Montgomery stated

201
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:47,542
that donations
could be made in her name

202
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,959
- to the city ballet or the garden club.
- I'm bored.

203
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,041
Is there a reason
I have to be here for this?
Yes, the reason being

204
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:57,041
that our mother is dead and you
are a part of this family.

205
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,959
I've spoken
to a lot of her friends,

206
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,667
but I may have missed some.

207
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:02,667
I'm not sure
where bizzy's address book is.

208
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:04,667
Not to worry. Mrs. Montgomery
met with me every year

209
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:06,542
to update
the contact information

210
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:09,083
of the people
she wanted to invite.
God forbid
the wrong sort show up.

211
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:12,041
Well, to be clear, she wanted
a public memorial service

212
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,041
with a reception to follow
at the house.

213
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:17,041
The interment is just for
family and close friends

214
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,041
the following morning.

215
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,542
Well, it sounds like
bizzy thought of everything.

216
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:24,083
One last thing.
Mrs. Montgomery requested

217
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:27,125
that there be one eulogy.

218
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,458
I'd be happy to do it.

219
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,750
Actually, sir. She asked
that Addison do it.

220
00:10:31,792 --> 00:10:34,000
Ha.

221
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:39,750
Why aren't we staying
at a hotel again?

222
00:10:39,792 --> 00:10:41,750
They've asked us not to.
We're being polite.

223
00:10:41,792 --> 00:10:44,041
Hotels have room service.
I vote for the hotel.

224
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,542
Hotels also have heat
and blankets

225
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:48,041
and emotional warmth.
Hotels have emotional warmth?

226
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,750
Or at least the possibility
of it.
Thank you.

227
00:10:50,792 --> 00:10:54,583
Are you people still here?
Oh, they're staying, captain.

228
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:57,375
Actually, sir--
our mother died.
You're staying.

229
00:10:57,417 --> 00:11:00,792
Well, in that case,
someone can refill my drink.

230
00:11:00,834 --> 00:11:03,750
If you all will excuse me,
it's been a long day.

231
00:11:03,792 --> 00:11:05,125
I'm gonna go lay down.

232
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,041
I have a question first.

233
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,583
You're all doctors
in this room, right?

234
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:11,125
Every single one of you.

235
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:15,542
So how does an army of doctors
let my wife die

236
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,417
without even
a good old-fashioned fight?

237
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:21,041
I mean, how many hundreds
of thousands of dollars

238
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,834
did your parents waste
on medical school

239
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,709
so you could let a relatively
young and healthy woman

240
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,083
just die on your watch?

241
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,875
It was a heart attack,
captain.

242
00:11:30,917 --> 00:11:33,375
It happened fast, and we
weren't there. I told you that.

243
00:11:33,417 --> 00:11:35,041
I thought it was
an aneurysm.

244
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:37,041
What?

245
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,959
Uh, you said she died
of an aneurysm.
Right. That's right.

246
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,333
Well, just now
you said heart attack.

247
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:45,542
It's an aneurysm.
I'm just tired.
She's grieving, Sam.

248
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,250
You're gonna split hairs?

249
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:50,041
- If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go lay down.
- Addie.

250
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:53,125
If you need someone
to talk to--
thank you.
I just need to rest.

251
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:08,000
I just wanted to make sure
you were okay.

252
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:11,458
I'm too busy to be sure.
What--what are you doing?

253
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,417
Trying to get an online petition
finalized, and i--

254
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:17,041
do you have any contacts
in the press?

255
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:20,041
Hilary, I know we've only been
working together a few months,

256
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,917
and, uh, and--and we didn't
get a lot done earlier,

257
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,291
but i--
Dr. Turner, with respect,
in the last 17 years,

258
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,041
I've filed
nine separate appeals,

259
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,709
I've petitioned six courts,

260
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,875
I've written 368 letters to
the state justice department,

261
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,959
I've lost two houses,
had three nervous breakdowns,

262
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,959
and I haven't slept through
the night in almost two decades.

263
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,917
And it all comes down
to this week.

264
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,875
So please, I'm busy.

265
00:12:43,917 --> 00:12:46,458
What if it doesn't work?

266
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,291
What if you can't get
Brett's execution stayed?

267
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,458
I told you,
I'm not thinking about that.

268
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,208
Hilary--
I said no.

269
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,041
Look, spare me
"the world isn't fair" speech.

270
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,750
Car accidents, sick kids--

271
00:12:58,792 --> 00:13:00,834
I know bad things happen
to good people.

272
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:03,208
But what's happening with Brett,
it's not the same.

273
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,709
It's preventable, and if I
don't do everything I can

274
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,458
to try to stop it--
and you really think you can?

275
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,041
After all these years
and all this work, you...

276
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,875
I'm--I'm worried about
what is gonna happen to you

277
00:13:13,917 --> 00:13:15,875
if this doesn't go your way.

278
00:13:15,917 --> 00:13:18,041
When everything you've
surrounded yourself with here

279
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:20,000
is--is moot, what then?

280
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,000
It'll never be moot.

281
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:25,041
I won't let go.
I won't stop.

282
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,875
Whether Brett's here or not,
I will clear his name.

283
00:13:27,917 --> 00:13:31,000
For our son's sake,
for my sake...

284
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:36,041
I won't stop.

285
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:50,041
Oh, I, uh, I thought
you'd be sleeping.

286
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,083
Susan's in there.

287
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,500
What?

288
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,041
In the urn.

289
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,583
I had her cremated
at her request,

290
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,667
and they delivered
the urn today.

291
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:02,417
It's pretty,
don't you think?

292
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:05,083
Uh, okay.

293
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,417
Cremation
is such a strange thing.

294
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:10,083
Addison--
I don't think I'd want
to be cremated,

295
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,083
except for the poetry of it,

296
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,041
the biblical allusion.

297
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:17,417
Ashes to ashes,
dust to dust.

298
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,041
That's nice.

299
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:23,417
Look, baby,
why don't you lie down?

300
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:26,041
All right? Let me hold you
while you sleep.

301
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,041
I don't want to be cremated.

302
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,041
Maybe I'll donate my body
to science.

303
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,625
Remember...

304
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:34,417
Our cadaver
in medical school?

305
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,625
Uh, yeah.

306
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,041
Yeah.
What did we call him?

307
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,041
We called him Mr. Mulligan.

308
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,875
Mulligan. Mulligan.

309
00:14:42,917 --> 00:14:45,375
I have no idea why.
It was Derek's idea.

310
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:52,041
Actually, he named it after
his favorite math teacher.

311
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,500
Mr. Mulligan.

312
00:14:54,542 --> 00:14:56,041
Remember...

313
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:58,625
What we did with him
when we were done?

314
00:14:58,667 --> 00:15:01,041
We gave him
a memorial service.

315
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,875
We thanked him
for his sacrifice

316
00:15:03,917 --> 00:15:06,417
and his contribution
to our education.

317
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:09,458
God. We were earnest.

318
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,041
We lit candles.

319
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:14,291
That was nice.

320
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,417
That's nice.

321
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,417
I think that's what I'll do.

322
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,625
Donate my body to science.

323
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,667
Where you going?

324
00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:28,750
I don't think I can sleep
with Susan in the room.

325
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,041
I don't care.

326
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:39,083
Archer, I-I know that
the relationships

327
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:43,041
in--in your family
are--are complicated, but--

328
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:45,041
oh, we're like
a bad Russian novel.

329
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:48,041
Yeah, but still,
bizzy was your mother.

330
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,417
You should care.

331
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,041
Sam's your ex-husband,

332
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:55,291
and Addison is probably up there
right now, screwing him.
Shh.

333
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:56,917
Do you care?

334
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,000
Sam and I were over
a long time ago.

335
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,041
So were
the captain and bizzy.

336
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,875
Doesn't stop him from simmering
with jealous rage.

337
00:16:03,917 --> 00:16:05,291
Yes.

338
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,166
Yes, it...

339
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,792
Yes, of course it--
it bothers me.

340
00:16:09,834 --> 00:16:11,166
I care.

341
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:14,041
But there are so many things
in life that bother me.

342
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,041
You know,
abortion bothers me,

343
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,041
and--and overpopulation
bothers me,

344
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,041
and those things are
at such horrifying odds,

345
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,667
that I can't even--

346
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:24,333
I can't even wrap my head
around it, you know?

347
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,333
I can't wrap my head around
anything, you know?

348
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:28,834
I mean--
you know I'm a grandmother?

349
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,834
I'm a grandmother,
for god sake.

350
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,834
And that,
that seriously bothers me.

351
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,792
But I can't control anything.

352
00:16:34,834 --> 00:16:37,417
I just, uh...
Can't control anything.

353
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:40,041
Certainly not
anyone else's feelings.

354
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,834
You know...

355
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:45,041
Sam and Addison
are beyond my control.

356
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:48,041
And, yes, it does bother me.

357
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:51,125
But, uh... I choose
not to be angry

358
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:54,333
and, uh...
Not to be bitter.

359
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:58,625
And just, uh, you know,
live in the moment.

360
00:16:58,667 --> 00:16:59,834
Okay.

361
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,458
Let's.

362
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,000
Oh, no. This--Archer,
that is--

363
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:06,041
that is not what I meant.

364
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,500
I don't care.

365
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,041
Sorry. I was just, uh...

366
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:27,458
Cooper needs a little something
to help him sleep.

367
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,375
So do I.

368
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:38,375
You shouldn't drink alone.

369
00:17:40,917 --> 00:17:42,792
To bizzy.

370
00:17:42,834 --> 00:17:45,291
Right. To bizzy.

371
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,500
How are you with words?
Sorry?

372
00:17:47,542 --> 00:17:49,625
I have to write a eulogy
by tomorrow,

373
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:51,625
and I could use a little help.

374
00:17:51,667 --> 00:17:54,041
Are you a good writer?

375
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,875
No, not really.

376
00:17:57,834 --> 00:18:00,500
Plus, I didn't really
know bizzy.

377
00:18:00,542 --> 00:18:03,041
No one did.

378
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,041
Well, maybe don't write it.

379
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,041
Maybe just, uh,

380
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:09,208
get up there
and speak from the heart.

381
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:14,291
Sorry. She did this
to me, you know?

382
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:17,417
This is her final insult,
her final cruelty,

383
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,208
to pick me...

384
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:22,417
To stand up
in front of everyone and lie.

385
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:25,291
You really think
you have to lie?

386
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:28,041
Believe me. Nobody wants
to hear the truth.

387
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:30,291
You mean that your mother
killed herself?

388
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,041
I'm
the hospital administrator.

389
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:36,250
I saw the death certificate.

390
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:41,041
For what it's worth,
I'm really sorry.

391
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:44,709
I can't imagine
how it must feel.

392
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:49,125
So if you want to talk,

393
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,041
I'm your gal.

394
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:54,250
And even if you don't,
my lips are sealed.

395
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:57,291
Either way,
tomorrow in that chapel,

396
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,250
you stand up,

397
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:02,250
say whatever the hell
you want.

398
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,291
Funerals aren't for the dead.

399
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,291
They're for the living.

400
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,291
They're to help us survive

401
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:11,041
when it feels like the grief
might just kill us.

402
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,750
Tomorrow's for you, Addison.

403
00:19:12,792 --> 00:19:15,041
You hear me?

404
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:19,000
Say whatever the hell
you want.

405
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:31,041
You'd think
after all this time,

406
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,500
I would know what to say,
right?

407
00:19:33,542 --> 00:19:36,000
Take your time.
The words will come.

408
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:45,333
Okay,
you're freaking me out.

409
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,041
Spit it out.

410
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:50,458
Whatever it is, as long
as you're not asking me to quit,

411
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,959
I can handle it.
I did it.

412
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,417
You did what?

413
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:56,041
I murdered Paul Miller.

414
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,000
It was me. I did it.

415
00:20:13,917 --> 00:20:16,250
Laughter relieves tension.

416
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:19,208
People laugh at funerals
all the time, you know?

417
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,250
It--it's--it's okay.

418
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:23,875
I never--i never--
I never wanted you to know.

419
00:20:23,917 --> 00:20:26,041
I-I always wanted you...

420
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,458
To believe in me.

421
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,458
I don't know
how I did that thing.

422
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,834
I still to this day don't know
how I did it. I am so sorry.

423
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:35,041
I am so sorry.

424
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,417
Hilary, I can't imagine
what this feels like.

425
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,834
But Brett did want you
to know the truth.

426
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,417
That's--
that's worth something.

427
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:50,041
No. No, no.
Please, don't, don't, don't.

428
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,375
Don't go. Don't go.

429
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:55,291
Baby, baby, please--
step back and put your hands
on the table.

430
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:58,041
Please don't go.
Step back now.

431
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,917
Baby, baby.

432
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:02,041
She needs time to process.

433
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,458
I don't have any time left.

434
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,458
Archer, you're not allowed
to oversleep

435
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,542
and miss bizzy's funeral.

436
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:13,834
Mm.

437
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,083
Mm.

438
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,917
What?
We're both adults.

439
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:20,959
Some clothes would be nice,
preferably something black.

440
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,458
Hilary, are you there?

441
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,041
The door was unlocked,
so i--what are you doing?

442
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:30,667
The governor usually
has dinner around 5:30,

443
00:21:30,709 --> 00:21:32,250
but his assistant
thought maybe

444
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,959
if I tried his
old office number--
hilary, you have to stop.

445
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,041
I have to find
my address book.

446
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:40,041
I just had it here,
and I don't know where--
look at me. Look at me.
Look at me.

447
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:43,041
Do you remember
seeing Brett this morning?
Do you think
I could forget that?

448
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:46,083
Do you think I could ever
forget that?
Well, he's--
he's ready to go, hilary.

449
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:48,250
He's made his peace.

450
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:50,041
D-Doesn't that mean anything,

451
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,125
th-that he's accepted his fate,
that at--

452
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:55,083
that at the very least,
it wasn't a wrongful execution?

453
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:58,041
Do you think
there's any such thing

454
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,458
as a rightful execution,
Dr. Turner?
That is not--

455
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,417
Justin was a colicky baby.

456
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,417
It started when he was about
a month old

457
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:06,417
and it didn't stop
for a year.

458
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,291
We never slept. It felt like
we were going crazy.

459
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:13,041
And then Brett got fired
when we were already broke.

460
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:16,041
And then his mother,
who was our only help,

461
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:19,500
dropped dead in the street.

462
00:22:19,542 --> 00:22:22,834
So Brett went to a bar,
and he had too many drinks.

463
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,834
He had too many drinks

464
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:27,125
and he had
so much rage inside him,

465
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:29,959
that...

466
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,959
But what about all
the good things that he did?

467
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
There were
so many good things.

468
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:36,542
Doesn't that count
for anything?

469
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:38,542
A lifetime of kindness,
doesn't that count?

470
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:40,041
Doesn't that...
Hilary--

471
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:42,542
make up for one mistake?
Let's talk about
your feelings.

472
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:45,125
You had a lot of feelings
come up this morning

473
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:48,125
when Brett told you the truth.
I want to talk about them.
I don't have time
to talk about my feelings

474
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,500
because my husband
is about to be murdered!

475
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,041
There it is.

476
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:59,125
Listen, I...

477
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:01,583
I need to go somewhere.

478
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:03,375
Will you come with me?

479
00:23:03,417 --> 00:23:06,750
Yes. Yes, of course.

480
00:23:06,792 --> 00:23:11,375
Dear lord, take back the soul
of Beatrice Forbes Montgomery.

481
00:23:11,417 --> 00:23:13,375
Amen.

482
00:23:13,417 --> 00:23:15,000
Amen.

483
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:23,166
And now
bizzy's daughter, Addison,

484
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:25,875
will say a few words.

485
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,250
Addison.

486
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,834
Uh...

487
00:23:53,917 --> 00:23:58,041
My mother told us that
we should never cry in public.

488
00:23:58,083 --> 00:24:00,500
The forbses didn't do that.

489
00:24:00,542 --> 00:24:02,417
If we needed to shed tears

490
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:05,417
it should be in the privacy
of one's own home.

491
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:08,291
Even better, in the privacy
of our own room.

492
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:11,667
I'm going to do my best
to honor that today.

493
00:24:11,709 --> 00:24:13,667
In her 62 years,

494
00:24:13,709 --> 00:24:17,041
bizzy taught me and my brother
a lot of things.

495
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:19,041
For as long as I can remember,

496
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:22,125
she always told us
never to settle for second best.

497
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:24,792
It wasn't enough
to be good at something.

498
00:24:24,834 --> 00:24:28,542
We had to be standouts
at whatever we did.

499
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:30,375
Bizzy didn't believe

500
00:24:30,417 --> 00:24:32,375
that every camper
should get a feather.

501
00:24:32,417 --> 00:24:35,000
My mother threw herself
into everything.

502
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:38,000
She did more volunteer work
than anyone I know.

503
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:41,959
She was also a leading member
of greenwich society.

504
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,917
She was president
of the junior league

505
00:24:43,959 --> 00:24:45,959
for almost 20 years.

506
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,333
She also ran

507
00:24:47,375 --> 00:24:50,208
the chamber of commerce
book sale every year.

508
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,959
But even though
her volunteer duties

509
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,041
kept her extremely busy,

510
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:57,291
she always had time
for her family.

511
00:24:57,333 --> 00:25:00,625
She was also
very good at sports.

512
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:03,041
She held
the state high school record

513
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:05,041
for the 50-yard backstroke.

514
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:10,000
That record was
only recently broken this year.

515
00:25:11,667 --> 00:25:14,625
My mother was a woman
who believed in accomplishment

516
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:16,333
above all else.

517
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:18,542
I think she remained true
to that belief

518
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:22,041
until the day she died.

519
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:24,458
May she rest in peace.

520
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,125
Addison making it hard?

521
00:25:45,166 --> 00:25:47,125
Mm. Impossible.

522
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:49,792
I've been there.

523
00:25:52,709 --> 00:25:55,083
You in the mood for advice
or just another drink?

524
00:25:55,125 --> 00:25:56,709
Both.
All right.

525
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:02,041
When Charlotte's father died,
she beat me up

526
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:04,083
because I was close
and I was safe.

527
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:06,458
But there's only so much
you can take.

528

Addison start to heal,

529

655

656
00:32:05,542 --> 00:32:08,041
There's
no medication for grief.

I thought Violet was
the shrink in the outfit.

660
00:32:15,792 --> 00:32:17,750
Fine. When your doctor
prescribed those,

661
00:32:17,792 --> 00:32:20,417
did he happen to mention that
you shouldn't drink with them?

662
00:32:20,458 --> 00:32:23,041
He might have.
You're lucky.
It's only been a few days.

663
00:32:23,083 --> 00:32:26,041

and probably
most of your relationships.

665
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,458
So drink if you have to,
but no more pills, okay?

666
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,250
I don't have to listen to you.
No, you don't,
but you have a shot here--

with your kids, a shot

669
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:41,750

670
00:32:41,792 --> 00:32:44,458

my wife.
I'm talking about your kids.

671
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,709
They're adults.
Not today.

672

just died.

673
00:32:48,959 --> 00:32:50,542
They're your kids.

674
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:53,542
And they need you
not to be drunk and stoned

675
00:32:53,583 --> 00:32:55,875
and...
Throwing punches

676
00:32:55,917 --> 00:32:59,750
and being
just all-around useless.

677
00:32:59,792 --> 00:33:01,208
They need their father,

678
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:03,041
and this might be
your last shot.

679
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:05,041

but... where was bizzy
gonna go when Susan died?

684
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:25,375
I was all she knew
for 40 years.

685
00:33:25,417 --> 00:33:28,000
I assumed she'd come home.

686
00:33:28,041 --> 00:33:30,709
You know, not to be romantic,

687
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:34,959
just... to live out
our lives together

688
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,834
instead of alone.

689
00:33:43,792 --> 00:33:46,000
I am so sorry for your loss.

690
00:33:57,083 --> 00:34:00,041
I don't know
what to do with Susan.

691
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:03,625
It seems wrong that she wasn't
at the memorial.

692
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:06,250
I just keep moving her
from room to room.

693
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:09,041
That was a nice eulogy.

694
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:11,000
Thank you.

695
00:34:11,041 --> 00:34:13,792
Now I want to hear
the real one.

696
00:34:13,834 --> 00:34:16,041
I need a drink.

697
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:19,041
I want to hear the real one.
Sam, I really don't have
the energy for this.

698
00:34:19,083 --> 00:34:21,208
I want to hear the real one.
No, Sam--

699
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,625
be real with me.
Sam--

700
00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:25,834
give me the real one.
I need to hear your real voice.

701
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:28,000
Because this Stepford wasp
thing, it's not--
Sam, please back up.

702
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:30,000
No, I'm not backing up.
Sam, you're scaring me.

703
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:33,041
No. Well, you're scaring me.

704
00:34:33,083 --> 00:34:36,041
I want to hear the real eulogy.
I want to hear the truth.

705
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:38,583
I want to hear from the woman
that I love...
Back off, Sam!

706
00:34:38,625 --> 00:34:41,208
From the woman that I love--
my mother died.

707
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,250
I know. I know. I know.

708
00:34:43,291 --> 00:34:47,041
I know. It's okay.

709
00:35:05,959 --> 00:35:08,041
What time is it?

710
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:09,834
Late.

711
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:13,667
It's getting late.

712
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,333
You don't have to go.

713
00:35:18,375 --> 00:35:20,542
You don't ever
have to see him again.

714
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:26,625
But you do have to accept
that he is dying tonight.

715
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:31,083
And as awful as that...
Is to accept,

716
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:33,083
it might give you a chance

717
00:35:33,125 --> 00:35:35,083
to say good-bye
on your own terms.

718
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:37,750
Give you a chance at least

719
00:35:37,792 --> 00:35:41,375
to tell him you love him.

720
00:35:41,417 --> 00:35:43,875
He knows I love him.

721
00:35:43,917 --> 00:35:46,166
If there's one thing
that man has to know,

722
00:35:46,208 --> 00:35:48,333
it's that I love him.

723
00:35:48,375 --> 00:35:52,041
The way you left this morning,
he might doubt it.

724
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:54,834
If I were him,
I would doubt it.

725
00:36:01,458 --> 00:36:03,333
What are you doing up here?

726
00:36:03,375 --> 00:36:05,041
Oh, I'm honoring bizzy.

727
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:07,041
Not that she ever got
sloppy drunk.

728
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:11,041
Say what you want about her,
the woman could hold her liquor.

729
00:36:11,083 --> 00:36:13,333
Come on back to the house.
I'll make you some coffee.

730
00:36:13,375 --> 00:36:16,083
Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

731
00:36:16,125 --> 00:36:18,041
Ahh.

732
00:36:18,083 --> 00:36:21,083
You and me, how'd we end up
such messes, huh?

733
00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:26,917
Look at us.

734
00:36:26,959 --> 00:36:30,083
You're screwing
your best friend's ex,

735
00:36:30,125 --> 00:36:33,041
and i'm--well, I'm screwing
anything with a pulse.

736
00:36:33,083 --> 00:36:35,041
I...

737
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:37,041
Am in love with Sam.
Huh.

738
00:36:37,083 --> 00:36:40,125
And you are up here
all alone, grieving,

739
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:43,542
because we're real people
with real feelings...

740
00:36:43,583 --> 00:36:46,834
Despite bizzy's best example.

741
00:36:46,875 --> 00:36:49,709
Well, here's to that.

742
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:57,083
She killed herself, Archer.

743
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:03,291
It wasn't an aneurysm
or a heart attack.

744
00:37:03,333 --> 00:37:05,417
She took some...

745
00:37:05,458 --> 00:37:08,458
Took a bottle of pills.

746
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:14,041
Well, isn't that
just par for the course?

747
00:37:14,083 --> 00:37:16,583
I've spent so much of my life
judging people.

748
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:19,583
You know that?
I've been so judgmental.

749
00:37:19,625 --> 00:37:22,041
It was actually
one of the few traits

750
00:37:22,083 --> 00:37:24,083
I did get from bizzy.

751
00:37:24,125 --> 00:37:27,667
I mean, when I was younger,
I would've thought it was weak.

752
00:37:27,709 --> 00:37:30,291
Suicide--it's so weak.

753
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:33,041
I mean,
what was she thinking?

754
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:35,041
How could she do that
to us--

755
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:37,041
to the captain,
to her children?

756
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:39,792
But... when I found her...

757
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:45,583
All I thought was, well...

758
00:37:47,166 --> 00:37:49,041
That's that.

759
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:54,458
People who do that,
they're not... thinking.

760
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:58,291
She wasn't thinking,
laying there broken.

761
00:37:58,333 --> 00:38:02,917
She was broken from grief.

762
00:38:02,959 --> 00:38:07,875
She was out to sea
and she drowned.

763
00:38:07,917 --> 00:38:10,041
It doesn't make her selfish.

764
00:38:10,083 --> 00:38:12,041
It doesn't even mean

765
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:14,709
that she didn't love us
in her own way.

766
00:38:19,709 --> 00:38:21,667
Maybe that's
what I would've said.

767
00:38:21,709 --> 00:38:25,125
If I could've told the truth,
that's what I would've said.

768
00:38:37,083 --> 00:38:40,917
I need to see my husband--
Brett loveman.
I'm sorry, ma'am.

769
00:38:40,959 --> 00:38:43,000
She only needs a few minutes.
Once a prisoner is in prep,

770
00:38:43,041 --> 00:38:44,750
he isn't allowed
any more outside contact.

771
00:38:44,792 --> 00:38:48,208
I can let you in to witness
the execution, but that's it.

772
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:51,041
No, please.
I don't--

773
00:38:51,083 --> 00:38:54,959
I don't know
if I can do that.
Okay, listen to me.
I don't say this lightly.

774
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,959
You are
one of the strongest people

775
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,959
I have ever had the honor
of knowing.

776
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,625
So the question isn't
can you do it.

777
00:39:01,667 --> 00:39:04,375
