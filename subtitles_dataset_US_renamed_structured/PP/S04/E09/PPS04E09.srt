Um, he's in there,

157
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:43,083
You pick him out of a lineup,
and then they can charge him.

Yeah.

then I'll go without ya.

167
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,709
There's
a relatively new process.

168
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,709
It involves inserting a probe
into your brain

169
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,709
and looking for the scarring
that initiates the seizures.

170
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,709
The probe is triggered
to transmit radio waves,

171
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,709
which heat and ablate
the scar.

172
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,709
She's gonna burn my brain?

173
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,709
I'm gonna remove
the trouble spot.

174
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,166
The idea is no more scar,
no more seizure, but--

175
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:29,417
you can just make them stop?
But it's not that simple.

176
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:32,041
The scarring that's causing
your mom's seizures is also

177
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,375
very close to
the motor center of the brain.

178
00:08:34,417 --> 00:08:37,417
What--what--
what does that mean?
Dr. Shepherd
can explain the risks.

179
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:40,083
Your mom could wind up
paralyzed in the arm or face.

180
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,208
She could have an aphasia--
difficulty speaking

181
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,000
or processing speech--

182
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:46,041
and in very rare cases,
there is partial blindness.

183
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,041
But these are
worst-case scenarios.

184
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:51,041
More likely--i cut, the seizures
stop, your mom is fine.

185
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:54,041
And if I don't do
the surgery?

186
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,041
Well, the seizures
could get worse.

187
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,583
They put you at risk
for head injury and falls.

188
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,041
And if they continue

189
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,041
with the intensity
that we've witnessed,

190
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,041
you will likely have
irreversible brain damage.

191
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:06,041
Paralyzed today
or demented tomorrow--

192
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:07,667
lovely choice.

193
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:10,667
How long before the seizures
cause permanent brain damage?

194
00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:12,208
10, 15 years.

195
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,583
Well, in ten years,

196
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:18,041
you'll be 25.

197
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:21,041
So if you didn't want to do
the surgery now, you could...

198
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,208
Do it in a year,
five years from now.

199
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,667
And be that much worse off.
It depends on when you want
to take the risk.

200
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:29,250
I'm offering you a cure.

201
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:34,625
No.

202
00:09:34,667 --> 00:09:38,458
No surgery.

203
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,375
Look, is there a chance
for an adverse result? Yes.

204
00:09:41,417 --> 00:09:43,375
But... I mean,
there is a better chance

205
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:45,917
that I can make you better,
completely.

206
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:48,208
I think
that Sharon was clear.

207
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,834
You and me...

208
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:55,041
We're doing all right
the way things are, right?

209
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,542
Yeah.

210
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,667
Yeah, we are.

211
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,917
You are not a neurosurgeon.

212
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:13,917
You were promising her
a cure.

213
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:17,417
Because I can give her one
because I am a neurosurgeon.

214
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,750
Look, I don't tell you
how to handle vaginas.

215
00:10:19,792 --> 00:10:23,250
Okay. If you cut and it
goes bad, what happens to Julie?

216
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,959
If I don't cut,
what happens to the mother?

217
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Right now,
nothing they can't handle.
How risky is the procedure?

218
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,375
Well, it's risky enough
that the mother could wind up

219
00:10:30,417 --> 00:10:31,875
paralyzed or blind,

220
00:10:31,917 --> 00:10:34,041
which means that
her 15-year-old daughter

221
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:37,041
would wind up taking care of her
instead of the other way around.

222
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:40,041
I mean, look, better that
they have five or ten

223
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:42,959
good years together
than none at all.
I am offering them
a lifetime together,

224
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
not just a few years.
Does the daughter
even want the surgery?

225
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,875
No.
Because she's taking the lead
from her mom.

226
00:10:47,917 --> 00:10:49,709
No, Amelia. She heard you.

227
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,959
She heard both of us,
and she made a decision.
You stacked the deck.

228
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,041
Stacked the deck? I gave them
my professional opinion--

229
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,041
like I said. You are not
an neurosurgeon.

230
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,750
Did either of you
tell Cooper?

231
00:11:05,792 --> 00:11:07,333
- What?
- No.

232
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,000
Absolutely not,
Charlotte.

233
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:13,000
I didn't tell Cooper,
but I-I told the cops.

234
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,792
The police brought me in

235
00:11:16,834 --> 00:11:19,500
to interview a guy
on the night of your...

236
00:11:19,542 --> 00:11:22,000
He admitted
to having attacked a woman.

237
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:26,000
He was--he was arrested
not far from the hospital.

238
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,542
Sheldon knows.

239
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:32,041
Is there anyone you people
haven't told?

240
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:37,000
I...

241
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,041
I sent the police
pelvic washings that I took.

242
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,041
I know you said no rape kit,
but--

243
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,792
please tell me
you did not do that.
You were in shock, Charlotte.

244
00:11:43,834 --> 00:11:46,375
I wanted to preserve
all of your options--
shut up.

245
00:11:46,417 --> 00:11:49,208
Just shut up.

246
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,583
They can't just arrest
the guy?

247
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:57,458
We can't get him off the streets
without Charlotte's help.

248
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,166
So that's why you're here...
Because of mom?

249
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:05,041
Well, it's not like I haven't
thought about getting in touch.

250
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,667
I'm sure you have, too.

251
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:09,417
She's dying.
Slowly, but she's dying.

252
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,875
And no one in there
gives a damn.

253
00:12:11,917 --> 00:12:14,792
But you can help her.
How?

254
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,709
You know what
a humanitarian release is,

255
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,750
right?

256
00:12:20,834 --> 00:12:23,083
You know, I've thought
about calling you.

257
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:26,667
Whatever problems you and I have
are because of her.

258
00:12:26,709 --> 00:12:29,083
But for you to show up here
after all these years

259
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:32,834
and try to guilt me
into some--
I'm not asking you to do
anything wrong. Please...

260
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,875
Just go see her.

261
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,000
That's all I'm asking.

262
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:48,208
Hey. I want you to
convince her to do the lineup.

263
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,959
Come on, Cooper.
Maybe she'll listen to you.

264
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,250
She sure as hell
won't listen to me.
It's not my place to
tell Charlotte to do anything.

265
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:57,125
She hasn't asked me for help.
Like that's ever stopped you.

266
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,875
It's the right thing.
You went after Katie.
I wanted revenge.

267
00:12:59,917 --> 00:13:02,041
So what's wrong with that?

268
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,041
Well, in the end,
that would've hurt me more,

269
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,041
so I forgave her
and I let it go.

270
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,041
Well, I want Charlotte
to have the same option.

271
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:12,000
I know her, Violet. She needs
to look that bastard in the eye

272
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,000
and say, "it was you."

273
00:13:15,917 --> 00:13:18,041
Hey.
Hey.

274
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:20,041
Heard you, uh, had a visitor.

275
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,917
Hard to keep
a secret around here.

276
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,959
Yeah. I was surprised.
You, uh...

277
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,500
You never mentioned
you had a brother.

278
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:30,792
I haven't talked to him
in a long time,

279
00:13:30,834 --> 00:13:32,917
not since my mother...

280
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:39,792
My mother's in prison...
For manslaughter.

281
00:13:39,834 --> 00:13:41,500
For...

282
00:13:41,542 --> 00:13:44,792
Oh. I, uh...
I can't imagine.

283
00:13:44,834 --> 00:13:47,000
Now she's sick.
He shows up out of the blue.

284
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,709
He wants me to help her
get a humanitarian release.

285
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,542
Are you going to?

286
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,542
I don't know.

287
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,208
What's your mother like?

288
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,959
Uh... my--

289
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,709
I don't know.
She's, uh, she's a mom.

290
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:04,375
My mother just...
Didn't really give a damn.

291
00:14:04,417 --> 00:14:07,750
Well, my mom used to say,

292
00:14:07,792 --> 00:14:11,041
"people do the best they can
when they can."

293
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,000
Her best wasn't anything.

294
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:14,959
You think she changed?

295
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,875
I don't know.
Well, sometimes
people can surprise you.

296
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:30,542
Homework?

297
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:33,417
Oh.
My model u.N. Speech.

298
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,792
Mm. That's a lot of work...

299
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:38,834
On top of what's going on
with your mom.

300
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:42,041
I've been through worse.

301
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,375
My dad died when I was 5.

302
00:14:45,834 --> 00:14:49,417
And suddenly, I was always
worried about my mom...

303
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,834
You know, how sad she was

304
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:55,083
and how much she missed him.

305
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:58,625
And I stopped being her kid.

306
00:14:58,667 --> 00:15:01,041
You know, she was always
trying to keep me busy,

307
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,583
thinking that... you know,
then I wouldn't worry.

308
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:06,083
Same.
But then I was just
busy and worried,

309
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:10,041
and after a while, it...

310
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,083
Well, it was all too much.

311
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,542
I worry every day.

312
00:15:18,917 --> 00:15:21,041
Julie, listen to me.

313
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,834
This procedure...

314
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:25,333
Your mom could live
the rest of her life

315
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:28,041
without ever having
another seizure.

316
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,709
My mom thinks the surgery
is a mistake.

317
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,250
And i-i...

318
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:34,667
I want what she wants.

319
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,041
Keep your expectations low,
okay?

320
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:49,041
And if you change your mind,
you know,

321
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,917
you can always leave without
seeing her. That's okay.

322
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:55,041
No harm done. You sure you
don't want me to go with you?
No, that's okay. I'll be fine.

323
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:58,041
But thanks.
Okay. Anything else
I can do for you?

324
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,041
When I get home tonight,

325
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,917
I'm gonna... want nudity,

326
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,375
all kinds of nudity.

327
00:16:04,417 --> 00:16:06,875
Absolutely.

328
00:16:06,917 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm proud of you.

329
00:16:24,542 --> 00:16:26,792
What?

330
00:16:26,834 --> 00:16:30,041
I need to say something that
you're not gonna want to hear.

331
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:33,041
Then how about
you don't say it?

332
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,291
Can you listen, please?

333
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,000
You got 60 seconds.

334
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,792
Okay.

335
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:44,959
Um...

336
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:52,500
When they prosecuted...

337
00:16:52,542 --> 00:16:54,834
My rapist,

338
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,834
um, there was this woman

339
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,834
in the gallery
of the courtroom.

340
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:01,041
And she watched,
and she listened

341
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,583
to what I had gone through,
and she came every day.

342
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,583
And then at the end
of the trial,

343
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,583
she, uh,
introduced herself to me,

344
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,959
and she thanked me for, uh,

345
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,458
for having the courage
that she didn't have.

346
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,625
Turns out that he had...
Raped her, too,

347
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:19,125
about six months before.

348
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:21,583
And I stared at her

349
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:25,834
and I just wanted to...

350
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,250
Slap her,

351
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:30,625
because I knew that
if she had come forward

352
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:32,625
then maybe--maybe--

353
00:17:32,667 --> 00:17:34,625
I would not have been raped.

354
00:17:34,667 --> 00:17:36,083
Screw you, Violet.

355
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,834
Charlotte...
The lineup is important.

356
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:42,792
No matter how hard it is,
I can tell you from experience

357
00:17:42,834 --> 00:17:44,792
that it is
the right thing to do.

358
00:17:44,834 --> 00:17:47,417
Time's up. Get out.

359
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,917
Hi, mom.

360
00:18:26,959 --> 00:18:29,083
Hi.

361
00:18:31,542 --> 00:18:33,917
Hello, Frances.

362
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:36,667
I was hoping you'd come.

363
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:50,458
You look good, Peter.
You filled out.

364
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,291
It's Pete now.

365
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:55,458
Oh, that suits you better.

366
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,375
Okay. Any chest pains,
palpitations?

367
00:18:58,417 --> 00:19:00,458
Adam tells me
you're remarried

368
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,333
and you have a son.

369
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,917
I'd love to hear about
your family.

370
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:08,500
Well, his wife's a doctor.

371
00:19:08,542 --> 00:19:11,041
Violet. And their
little boy Lucas.

372
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,500
Lucas.
Mm-hmm.

373
00:19:12,542 --> 00:19:16,291
That's a good name
for a boy.

374
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,291
Well, your chart is a mess.

375
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,625
Have you ever heard
any of your doctors talk about

376
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:23,375
elevated blood pressure,
high levels of cholesterol,

377
00:19:23,417 --> 00:19:26,333
or triglycerides?
I hardly ever see a doctor.

378
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,333
They don't pay
much attention to me.

379
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:31,041
You know, when you're old
and in prison,

380
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,625
somebody comes and checks to see
you're breathing,

381
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:36,750
then they just move along.
Uh, and that's why
Pete's here,

382
00:19:36,792 --> 00:19:38,792
'cause I told him
how they treat you in here

383
00:19:38,834 --> 00:19:40,834
and--and how bad
you've been feeling.

384
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:43,333
Let her talk
for herself, Adam.
Your brother's right.

385
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:46,041
He's trying to do his job.
Just let him.

386
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:49,083
You still smoking
and drinking?

387
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,375
Not officially.
Some things don't change.

388
00:19:51,417 --> 00:19:54,166
No matter how hard
you try.

389
00:19:58,917 --> 00:20:02,166
I--it's just
that we're all together again.

390
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,250
You're a doctor.

391
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:07,333
And he's a lawyer.

392
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,875
Would you ever imagine?

393
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,041
It's nice.

394
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:18,333
I'm sorry. I won't...

395
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:21,625
I'm sorry.

396
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,500
Hey.

397
00:20:39,834 --> 00:20:41,250
Okay.

398
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:42,792
Okay what?

399
00:20:42,834 --> 00:20:44,667
I'll do the lineup.

400
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:55,000
I will call detective price.
When do you want to go in?

401
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:58,041
I thought I'd ask Violet
to go with me.

402
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,333
Oh. Why?

403
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:03,625
Well, she's been through
the system... with Katie.

404
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:06,041
I thought it would
make things easier for me

405
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,500
to have her there.

406
00:21:07,542 --> 00:21:09,500
Is that okay?

407
00:21:09,542 --> 00:21:12,500
Sure. Of course.
Whatever it takes.

408
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:19,125
She's different, right?

409
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,917
35 years in jail,
it changed her.

410
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:23,417
How could it not?

411
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,208
It doesn't change
what happened.

412
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,208
I'm not saying it does.

413
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:31,125
But we can't
let her die in there.

414
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,875
Wasn't all bad.

415
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:35,041
Remember the swimming?

416
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,542
She used to let us swim
in Mr. Kramer's pool

417
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:40,041
whenever he went out of town.
We were
breaking and entering.

418
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,041
Yeah, but it was
still swimming.

419
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,041
You loved it.
We all did.

420
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,750
A hot summer night,

421
00:21:45,792 --> 00:21:48,250
just the three of us,
swimming and laughing.

422
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:50,125
Stop it.
Stop what?

423
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:52,959
Stop trying to sell her to me
like a used car salesman.

424
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,542
I was there. I remember
everything. That's the problem.

425
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:58,041
I remember everything.
Well, maybe she'd do it
differently if she could.

426
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,333
Maybe she wouldn't.
I don't know.

427
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:02,709
You know something?
You have a chance

428
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,041
to do something right
for this family.

429
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:08,083
So if you don't care about her,
that's fine.

430
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:10,375
But you do this for me.

431
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:17,291
Hey.

432
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:18,834
Hey.

433
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,375
So I spoke to Julie,

434
00:22:20,417 --> 00:22:22,500
and I think she wants her mother
to have the surgery now.

435
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:25,083
First of all, you had
no right to talk to her

436
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:27,291
without her mother's consent.
Second...

437
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:29,083
How do you know?

438
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:31,417
Well, it wasn't explicit,
but I could tell.

439
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:33,417
Even if you're right,
Sharon doesn't want it.

440
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:35,959
Sharon doesn't want it
because of Julie,

441
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:38,583
because you scared her
and made her feel like

442
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:41,542
she was placing her daughter
in a terrible position.
Amelia--

443
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:43,041
no, if we do nothing, Julie
is gonna wake up in ten years,

444
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:46,333
and her mother
is gonna be a vegetable.
But Julie will be an adult.

445
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:48,959
I'm an adult.

446
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,583
Do you think that means
I miss my father any less?

447
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:54,208
He never
saw me become a surgeon.

448
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,041
He is not gonna walk me
down the aisle.

449
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,041
He is not gonna see my kids.

450
00:22:58,083 --> 00:23:00,041
I would give anything,
Addison...

451
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:02,166
Anything to have him.

452
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:04,166
You're talking about
10 or 15 good years.

453
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:06,166
I am talking about a lifetime.

454
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:08,166
If somebody would've
given me the chance

455
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:10,458
to have him for all of that...

456
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:24,875
Even if she's changed,

457
00:23:24,917 --> 00:23:27,000
it doesn't mean that
what she did didn't happen.

458
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:29,709
But it also doesn't mean
she can't be forgiven.

459
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:34,208
I don't know
if I can go that far.

460
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:37,458
You forgave me.

461
00:23:43,959 --> 00:23:45,917
Oh! I gotta work
on my timing.

462
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:49,291
Well, at least I got
my pants on this time.

463
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:51,291
Yeah.
Thank you.

464
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:53,417
No, thank you.
Hey, husband number two.

465
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:55,333
Step forward.

466
00:23:57,458 --> 00:24:00,583
Which, uh,
cheek did he kiss?

467
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:03,208
What is that for?

468
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,834
For talking to Charlotte.

469
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:07,834
You did talk to her?
You convinced her?

470
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:10,458
I spoke to her.
Oh, thank you.

471
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,208
What time
are you going to the station?

472
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,959
What do you mean?

473
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,542
For the lineup.

474
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:19,750
Oh, Charlotte wants you to take
her. Did she not say anything?

475
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:22,125
Uh, oh. Then I will.
Of course. I will.

476
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:23,750
Yeah.

477
00:24:27,917 --> 00:24:29,041
Hey.

478
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:30,250
Hi.

479
00:24:30,291 --> 00:24:33,250
Your mom said you were
down here doing your homework.

480
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:36,041
Yeah, I am. I was.

481
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:39,041
I'm just--
I'm trying to figure out

482
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:42,792
if my mom's seizures
are happening closer together.

483
00:24:42,834 --> 00:24:45,000
I-I-I think they are.

484
00:24:45,041 --> 00:24:47,333
You take good care of her,
don't you?

485
00:24:47,375 --> 00:24:49,333
We take care of each other.

486
00:24:49,375 --> 00:24:51,125
She's my mom, you know?

487
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:52,917
I don't, actually.

488
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:55,500
I'm not really...
Uh, biz--my mom and I,

489
00:24:55,542 --> 00:24:57,500
we're not, uh...
We're not close.

490
00:24:57,542 --> 00:25:00,417
So to me, having ten
good years with your mom,

491
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:02,333
well, that seems like a lot.

492
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:05,625
But, you know,
the kind of relationship

493
00:25:05,667 --> 00:25:08,917
that the two of you have--
yeah, my mom's amazing
and brave.

494
00:25:08,959 --> 00:25:12,041
I don't mind doing this.

495
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:14,083
I really don't.

496
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:15,834
I'm sure that
that's true,

497
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:17,625
which is why I think

498
00:25:17,667 --> 00:25:21,041
that you've earned the right
to have a say in this.

499
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:24,000
If it were up to you,
what would you want?

500
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:29,583
Number 1, step forward.

501
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:34,375
No.

502
00:25:34,417 --> 00:25:36,375
Number 1,
step back.

503
00:25:36,417 --> 00:25:39,417
Number 2, step forward.

504
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,458
Step back, number 2.

505
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,041
Number 3, step forward.

506
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:49,333
No.

507
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:51,834
Number 3, step back.

508
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:55,000
Number 4, step forward.

509
00:26:01,583 --> 00:26:04,000
He's not here.

510
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:07,875
Are you sure?

511
00:26:07,917 --> 00:26:10,875
Yes. I'm sure.

512
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:23,458
Hey.

513
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,000
Did she pick our guy?
She looked him
straight in the eye

514
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:28,000
and said he wasn't the one.
But she saw him.

515
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:30,709
She knows he's the guy.
Well, not anymore.

516
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:33,041
Well, what happens to Lee?

517
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:37,750
Ask him yourself.

518

of this place, can you, doc?

519

I'd rather be.

520
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:45,458
Well, then you and I,
we got something in common.

521
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,750
You'll do it again, Lee.

522
00:26:47,792 --> 00:26:49,375
You'll rape another woman.

523
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:53,875
You don't have any proof
that I did it.

524
00:26:53,917 --> 00:26:57,500
And even if I did do it,
it doesn't mean I'd do it again.

525
00:26:57,542 --> 00:27:00,041
You think if you keep telling
yourself that, it won't happen?

526
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:02,834
Those feelings?
They don't go away.

527
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:05,875

we both know what happens.

528
00:27:05,917 --> 00:27:07,792

529

number 4?

530
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,875
No.

531
00:27:27,917 --> 00:27:29,458

532
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,375

when he stepped forward,

533
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:33,375
the way you looked at him.

534
00:27:33,417 --> 00:27:35,375
That was the guy
that attacked you.

535
00:27:35,417 --> 00:27:36,875
I said no.

536
00:27:36,917 --> 00:27:39,834
You didn't bring me here
for moral support, did you?

537
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:42,834
You wanted a witness to go
tell Cooper that you had tried,

538
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:44,834
because if he had been here,

539
00:27:44,875 --> 00:27:47,041
he would've seen
how you reacted,

540
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:49,083
and he would've known, too.
Charlotte, listen to me.

541
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,083
I have been through this,
and this is hard--

542
00:27:51,125 --> 00:27:54,000
I am so sick and tired
of hearing about your rape.

543
00:27:54,041 --> 00:27:55,625
That was 20 years ago,

544
00:27:55,667 --> 00:27:58,041
and you're still talking
about it, how you got over it.

545
00:27:58,083 --> 00:28:01,291
Yay, you. Is that
what you want to hear?
No, it--that--

546
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:04,208
if you ask me, you are not
so whole and normal.

547
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,208
You are not so put together.

548
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,709
You are high-strung,
neurotic,

549
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,041
and you stick your nose
into other people's business.

550
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:14,834
That is what you do,
and I am tired of it!

551
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:29,667
Hey.

552
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:32,041
I've been looking
at my mother's chart.

553
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:34,041
I think I found something.

554
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:37,125
All right,
I see some mild c.O.P.D.

555
00:28:37,166 --> 00:28:39,583
And evidence of
atherosclerotic heart disease,

556
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:41,125
which is pretty standard

557
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:44,041
from a long-term smoker
your mother's age.

558
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:46,625
I see
recurrent idiopathic v-fib.

559
00:28:46,667 --> 00:28:49,166
Well, that's a potentially
lethal condition,

560
00:28:49,208 --> 00:28:52,166
and I don't see
any indication of that.

561
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:54,041
Recurrent v-fib requires

562
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:55,667
a surgically implanted
automatic defibrillator,

563
00:28:55,709 --> 00:28:58,792
which they can't monitor
in prison.

564
00:28:58,834 --> 00:29:00,333
If she needed it,

565
00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:04,375
they'd probably just release her
on humanitarian grounds.

566
00:29:04,417 --> 00:29:06,375
They won't accept a medical
recommendation from me.

567
00:29:06,417 --> 00:29:10,417
I'm family. But they would
accept one from you.

568
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:12,291

569
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:20,458

580

You sure this is
what you want to do?

581
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:21,792
I think so.

582
00:30:21,834 --> 00:30:23,792
Yes.

583
00:30:23,834 --> 00:30:26,834

with the fact that it's--
it's a lie?

584

If I want to get her out,
I don't have a choice.

585
00:30:29,583 --> 00:30:31,917

they protect people.

587
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:35,625
Charlotte deliberately
didn't identify her attacker

589
00:30:37,667 --> 00:30:39,166
Why?

590
00:30:39,208 --> 00:30:42,083
Because she couldn't
face up to it,

591
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:44,083

might get hurt.
