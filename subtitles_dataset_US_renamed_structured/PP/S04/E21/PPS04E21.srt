♪ Ohhh ohhh ohhh ♪

2
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:13,083
I have to go to work.

3
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,041
And I feel used.
Gabriel.

4
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:20,083
We were at a wedding,
we got carried away, that's all.

5
00:01:21,834 --> 00:01:23,000
Move to D.C. with me.

6
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,375
Oh. Thanks.

7
00:01:35,542 --> 00:01:36,875
That's where
I'm going too.

8
00:01:36,917 --> 00:01:39,041
The doctors there
aren't expensive, are they?

9
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:40,333
I'm already working
at a bar

10
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:42,041
to put myself
through grad school.

11
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:44,333
Don't worry. Our patients
are our first priority.

12
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:47,625
So you're one of the doctors?
Yes. I'm Dr. Montgomery.

13
00:01:47,667 --> 00:01:51,291
Oh. You're the one I'm coming
to see. I'm Patty--

14
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:55,041
Patty? What is it?
Oh, my stomach.

15
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,917
Okay. Okay.
It's okay.

16
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:02,000
It's okay, Patty.

17
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:05,959
What did you give me?
I feel better.

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's an antiemetic.
Helps with the nausea.

19
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:12,750
That's tender?

20
00:02:12,792 --> 00:02:15,000
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna do an ultrasound.

21
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:17,041
Have you had
any other symptoms lately?

22
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,000
Any recent changes in health?

23
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:21,709
Patty, what is it?

24
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:24,709
I had an abortion
two months ago.

25
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:30,250
I tried to go to this clinic,
but outside were all these...

26
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:31,875
Protesters?

27
00:02:31,917 --> 00:02:33,709
The things
they were yelling,

28
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,208
calling me a murderer,
a baby killer.

29
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,709
I couldn't go in.

30
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,041
I tried to find
a private doctor,

31
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,959
but most of them
won't do abortions.

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,959
I'm lucky my girlfriend
knew a doctor who would.

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,792
Yeah. Well, it's hard
to do your job

34
00:02:45,834 --> 00:02:47,041
when you're getting
death threats.

35
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:50,041
Some doctors aren't even trained
in the procedure anymore.

36
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:52,792
I want kids. I do.
Just not now.

37
00:02:52,834 --> 00:02:56,834
I mean, babies are expensive,
kids need time and attention.

38
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,583
It seemed wrong to bring one
into the world

39
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,041
I couldn't do right by.

40
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:02,000
Patty, you don't have to justify
your decision to me.

41
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:07,959
The doctor told me I might have
some cramping and tenderness,

42
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,458
but I didn't expect
to feel this bad.

43
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,000
Okay. Let's take a look.

44
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:19,000
What is it?
Is something wrong?

45
00:03:21,417 --> 00:03:23,166
Patty, I'm sorry. Uh...

46
00:03:24,792 --> 00:03:27,000
You're still pregnant.

47
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,792
The fetus looks to be
about 19 weeks.

48
00:03:43,834 --> 00:03:47,375
But this-- I can't--
I can't be pregnant.

49
00:03:47,417 --> 00:03:50,250
Charlie and I, we used a condom.
I had an abortion.

50
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:52,041
Sometimes when an abortion
is done early,

51
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,458
the pregnancy is so small

52
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,667
that the doctor
can miss the embryonic tissue

53
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:57,041
when removing it
from the uterus.

54
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,667
But I got drunk
last weekend.

55
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:00,583
I smoked two packs
of cigarettes.

56
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,041
You have to do
something.

57
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,041
You can just do it again,
right?

58
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:09,875
Patty, you need to understand
that this isn't just tissue.

59
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,792
You're carrying
a fetus now,

60
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:15,041
and the procedure
is much more difficult.

61
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:16,333
What would you have
to do to me?

62
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,750
There's something
called laminaria,

63
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:22,041
seaweed sticks
that absorb fluid and swell.

64
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,917
They would be inserted into
your cervix to help it dilate.

65
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,041
Twenty-four hours later
you would be brought back in,

66
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:31,041
put under general anesthesia,
and the fetus would be removed

67
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:34,041
using forceps and suction.

68
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:37,041
Could the baby survive?
No, not at 19 weeks.

69
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,625
The baby needs to be
at least 24 weeks

70
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:40,917
to survive
outside the uterus.

71
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:43,709
The fetus would die
during the procedure.

72
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,041
I think I'm gonna be sick.

73
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,709
Look, um,
there are other options.

74
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,000
You can carry the baby
to term.

75
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:51,792
Don't you think I considered
all the options last time?

76
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:53,000
I can't carry a child,

77
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:57,291
I'm on my feet eight hours
a day, I have no money.

78
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,917
God, I'm pregnant.

79
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:01,959
Look, I, uh--

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,917
I know that this is a shock,

81
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:05,875
so why don't you take some time,

82
00:05:05,917 --> 00:05:08,000
think about
what you wanna do?

83
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,250
Okay, say hello
to a married man.

84
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,041
Sam &amp; Naomi:
Hey.

85
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:19,041
If two people get married and
you don't actually witness it,

86
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,041
did it really happen?

87
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:24,041
Sorry about that.
Mm-hm. Well, congratulations.

88
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,125
Thank you.

89
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,417
Any word from
the medical board?

90
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,041
Well, I still have my license,

91
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,375
so I have every right
to be here.

92
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:36,000
Wait, that's--
that's not what I meant. I--

93
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,000
Addison:
Sometimes I hate being a doctor.

94
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,959
My new patient,
she's 19 weeks pregnant,

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,500
and she may want
an abortion.

96
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:43,041
A partial-birth abortion?

97
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,709
Partial-birth is not
a medical term. It's political.

98
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,166
Okay, late-term abortion,
second-trimester, d&amp;E.

99
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:50,041
Who cares what you call it?
You can't do it.

100
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,041
Yes, she can.
It's at the doctor's discretion

101
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,959
and it is legal.

102
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,333
Did you even counsel her
on her options?

103
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,583
She was counseled
before her first abortion.

104
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,583
Her first abortion? Is she using
the procedure as birth control?

105
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,375
No, she used condoms.
Why are you judging?

106
00:06:03,417 --> 00:06:06,959
There is no judgment from us,
we are doctors.

107
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,041
And we all know that
birth control sometimes fails.

108
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,041
I didn't wanna tell her
because it would freak her out:

109
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,041
The doctor she went
to the first time was a quack,

110
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,333
who didn't know
what he was doing,

111
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:17,583
and now she's come to me,
and my job is to help her.

112
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:18,834
How did you leave it?

113
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,750
She's gonna think
and make her choice.

114
00:06:20,792 --> 00:06:21,959
Maybe the choice
has been made.

115
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,166
What does that mean?

116
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,041
I mean, condoms
are usually effective,

117
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:28,125
and failed abortions
are negligible.

118
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:31,041
So maybe this baby
was meant to live.

119
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:34,041
Sheldon:
You wanna force a woman
to give birth and raise a child

120
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,166
that she clearly doesn't want?
After what she did,

121
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,041
Patty should give the baby up
for adoption.

122
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,041
What she did was exercise
her right to choose.

123
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,709
Hey. Hey, Pete.
Cooper: So if she comes back,

124
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,625
what are you gonna do?
I have no idea.

125
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:48,709
Violet:
Oh, my god.

126
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:53,041
It's Betsey. She's in the E.R.

127
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,625
My head hurts.

128
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,041
I know, baby.
That was a big fall.

129
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,709
I was in the kitchen cooking.
I just--

130
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,041
I should've been watching her.

131
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,709
You have to fix her.
I will, Marshall. I promise.

132
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,041
I don't like it here.

133
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,041
Oh, baby, no one likes
hospitals,

134
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,458
but the doctors
are gonna make you better.

135
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:16,750
No. My mommy and daddy died
here. Everybody dies here.

136
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,250
Cooper: Is she all right?
Her vitals are stable.

137
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,417
Any loss of consciousness
or focal neuro signs?

138
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,041
Exam was negative.
Addison: C. Spine?

139
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,041
Clear. We're waiting on ct
and portable chest.

140
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,208
I thought social services

141
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,041
placed her with a family
in riverside.

142
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,458
Yeah. What is she--? What is
she doing in St. ambrose?

143
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,250
Her family moved to the Westside
a few months ago.

144
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,417
She's been right here?

145
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:42,917
Ct shows an extensive contusion
in the left temporal region.

146
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,000
Does that mean surgery?

147
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:45,125
The swelling could
go down.

148
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:47,333
We'll need to monitor her
for the next few days.

149
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,291
Addison:
Any other injuries
or signs of trauma?

150
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,583
No, the X-ray looks good.
No broken bones.

151
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:54,542
Just a healed clavicle fracture,
looks a couple months old.

152
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,041
Betsey broke her collarbone
two months ago

153
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,917
and now she falls
down the stairs?

154
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,500
Now, we shouldn't jump
to any conclusions.

155
00:07:59,542 --> 00:08:01,041
I do this every day, Sheldon,

156
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,000
and to me
that sounds like abuse.

157
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,166
Addison:
Cooper, you cannot jump
to abuse.

158
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,375
We should have social services
make an assessment.

159
00:08:14,417 --> 00:08:15,709
What do you think
we should do?

160
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,917
We can't leave her.

161
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,000
If you guys had
just taken her

162
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,542
when she got left
in the office--

163
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,000
this wouldn't have happened?

164
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,291
Oh, it's not like you took her.

165
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,709
Guys, this
isn't helping.

166
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,542
Okay, Pete. You met the parents.
What did you think?

167
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,583
They were
loving and concerned.

168
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,709
And Betsey is clearly
very attached.

169
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,291
To Betsey,
any parents are good.

170
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,625
Naomi: If they're abusing--
we have to get her out.

171
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:37,000
I broke four bones
by the time I was 10.

172
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,709
Kids fall all the time.
Pete: Okay, look.

173
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,709
It seems like Betsey's
found a good family.

174
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:44,041
We cannot risk ruining that
unless we have concrete proof.

175
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,000
Let's get some.

176
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:51,000
Cooper.

177
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,000
Hi, I'm Dr. Cooper Freedman.
Gina: Hi.

178
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,792
Cooper:
And this is Dr. Violet Turner.

179
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:56,041
We used to work
with Betsey's dad.

180
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,667
Oh.
Naomi.

181
00:08:57,709 --> 00:08:59,000
Hey, sweetie.

182
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,792
Phil and Gina rakoff.

183
00:09:00,834 --> 00:09:03,041
Behind the video game,
that's our son, Marshall.

184
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,041
Hi, I'm Dr. Naomi Bennett.

185
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:08,583
Betsey, look how popular
you are. All these visitors.

186
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,542
Uh, why don't we step over here

187
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,041
so I can update you on
what's going on?

188
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,875
I'm so glad to see you.

189
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,959
Why didn't you visit me?

190
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:24,083
I wanted to, I did. But--

191
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:26,000
I don't wanna talk to you.

192
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,542
Look, it's okay.

193
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,709
Hey, sweetie.

194
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,458
So how do you like
your new family?

195
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:43,000
That fall must have been scary,
huh?

196
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,333
You did fall, right, sweetie?

197
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:53,166
Sweetie, did somebody hurt you?

198
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,583
How about when you--?
When you broke the bone?

199
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,458
I--

200
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,083
I fell off the jungle gym.

201
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,208
Betsey, listen,

202
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:09,041
even if somebody told you not
to, you can tell me, okay?

203
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,667
I love you.
We all love you here.

204
00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:13,041
But you sent me away.

205
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,834
Gina:
What's the matter, honey?

206
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,208
Phil:
What's going on?
Why's she upset?

207
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,041
Um, to be perfectly honest,
I'm concerned about this fall

208
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,333
that seems to have come
on the heels

209
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,667
of the other accident
where she broke the clavicle.

210
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:24,291
Kids fall.

211
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:27,125
They do, but two severe ones,
so close together, it's...

212
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,041
Are you accusing us
of hurting her?

213
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:31,542
Phil:
We love Betsey.

214
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:34,041
You have no right--
don't be mean to my mommy.

215
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:37,041
You're upsetting our children
and you're both way out of line.

216
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,959
Get the hell out
and don't come back.

217
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,709
Poor kid, huh?

218
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,375
Yeah, I suppose
we made our bed.

219
00:10:54,417 --> 00:10:56,041
What, you think
this is our fault?

220
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:59,625
I think that we--
all of us at the practice.

221
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:00,959
We make decisions

222
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
and we don't think
about the consequences.

223
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:07,041
All I can think about lately
are consequences.

224
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,917
This Patty thing's really
killing you.

225
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,041
I'm fine.
You're not fine.

226
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,291
You wanna have a baby.

227
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,917
You want a baby so bad
that we broke up and now--

228
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:19,625
in a few weeks,
that fetus could be a baby.

229
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:22,834
Not just a collection of cells,
but a baby and...

230
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:25,000
Sorry.

231
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,875
Thank you.

232
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,875
I should go.
Mm-hm.

233
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,041
When I offered
to take you to lunch,

234
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,041
the hospital cafeteria

235
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,041
wasn't exactly what
I had in mind.

236
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,041
Yes, well, I need to be here
right now,

237
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,125
and I only have
a half an hour.

238
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,041
I gotta pick up Olivia.

239
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:55,250
Don't get me wrong. I'm happy
to see you as much as possible.

240
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:59,709
Don't. Do not ask me
about D.C. again, okay? Not now.

241
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,125
Betsey's in icu,

242
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:06,375
Addison may be performing
an abortion on a woman

243
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:08,041
who is 19 weeks pregnant.

244
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:11,125
Hmm. Late-term by definition,
but certainly not illegal.

245
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,583
I mean, I can see how
that might frustrate

246
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,041
someone whose work
is creating life.

247
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:19,458
That's a careful response.
You don't agree with me?

248
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,834
A fetus may be a life,

249
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,917
but it's not
a biologically independent life.

250
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,041
So in my mind, and in the mind
of the supreme court,

251
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,041
the right of termination
belongs to the mother.

252
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:31,041
Well, thank you
for the civics lesson.

253
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,000
Maybe you should offer
to assist Addison.

254
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:36,041
If I felt that strongly
about it, I would.

255
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,834
You know me.
I'm all about going after

256
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,333
what you believe in
as hard as possible.

257
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,041
She hates me.
Betsey does not hate you.

258
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,083
Of course she hates me.
I'm the one who sent her away.

259
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,667
I'm the one
who looked that little girl

260
00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:56,333
in the eye
and sold her a fairy tale

261
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,458
about how marvelous
her new life was gonna be,

262
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,041
because I couldn't tell
her the truth.

263
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,041
Now her foster parents
could be hurting her.

264
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,917
For all we know, she did fall.
But we don't know, do we?

265
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,542
It's just too much.
First Betsey loses her parents,

266
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:10,041
and then her aunt drops
her off here

267
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,709
like a package that was tossed
into the trash by us,

268
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,959
the people who were supposed
to care. And now tack on abuse?

269
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,041
I-- I had an obligation to
take care of Dell's little girl.

270
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,166
Look, you've gotta stop
beating yourself up.

271
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,000
Or is it me
that you blame for all this?

272
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,041
Well, right now,
I'm the one being blamed.

273
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,959
By Betsey. And that's all
I can think about.

274
00:13:34,542 --> 00:13:35,583
Can I go home soon?

275
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,041
We're working
on it, honey.

276
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,041
I told you to stay away
from my family.

277
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:43,375
I'm not coming in.
She is.

278
00:13:43,417 --> 00:13:45,750
Gladys?
Hi, Betsey. Remember me?

279
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:47,291
Our little girl
has a brain injury

280
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,125
and you called
social services?

281
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,417
Outside. Right now.

282
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:56,041
Amelia:
What are you doing?
She needs to stay calm.

283
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:59,041
For the next few days, our
main focus has to be her health.

284
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,291
I am worried about her health.

285
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:03,333
Dr. Freedman, I will follow up,
I promise.

286
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,375
But I think you're wrong
about Phil and Gina.

287
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,583
It is oddly therapeutic,
you know.

288
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:15,041
Please, you are preaching
to the choir.

289
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,834
My goodness.
I can't get enough.

290
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:19,750
Oh, but Maya's gonna be back
soon enough,

291
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,041
so I have to enjoy it
while I can.

292
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,667
Okay, I'll see you.
Bye.

293
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,667
Bye.
Naomi: Bye-bye.

294
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:30,041
Is Dr. Montgomery in?
She's at the hospital.

295
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,041
She should be back soon.

296
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:35,041
Can you tell her
that Patty stopped by?

297
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,959
Uh, Patty?

298
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,041
Hi. I'm--
I'm Dr. Naomi Bennett.

299
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,542
Would you like to wait
in my office?

300
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:45,959
I have some tissues. Okay.

301
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,166
I had a plan. I was gonna
finish grad school, get my mba,

302
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:53,041
meet a great guy
who thinks I hung the moon,

303
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:56,667
get married, and around
35 we'd have a baby.

304
00:14:56,709 --> 00:14:59,041
Well, no one is ready,
ever ready, to have a baby.

305
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:02,041
It's just--
you just do it.

306
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,041
You know, my daughter
was 16 years old

307
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,375
when she got pregnant
with Olivia here.

308
00:15:06,417 --> 00:15:08,041
She hadn't even finished
high school.

309
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,166
And I almost...

310
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:14,792
No, i-- I tried to force her
to have an abortion,

311
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:17,041
and I'm so grateful every single
day that she didn't.

312
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:20,041
But she had you to help her.
My boyfriend, Charlie,

313
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,834
he couldn't get away fast enough
when I told him I was pregnant.

314
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:25,041
That just means he's not ready
to be a father.

315
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,125
I can't be a mother.
I have nothing.

316
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,875
I have to work all the time.

317
00:15:28,917 --> 00:15:31,041
But being a mother isn't
about what you have,

318
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:31,959
it's about who you are.

319
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,959
I can't have this baby.
I can't.

320
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,458
I already got
an abortion before,

321
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,041
I can live through it
again.

322
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,500
It's not the same, Patty.

323
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:41,959
At 19 weeks, do you know
that your child can hear you?

324
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,709
It can be startled
by loud noises.

325
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,542
Your child already
has vocal cords

326
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:51,458
and fingerprints and air sacs
in her lungs.

327
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,709
She can move her arms and legs,
not unlike Olivia here.

328
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,500
Yeah. Yeah.

329
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:00,041
I know you're confused,

330
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,166
which is why
I think you need

331
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,000
a little more time
to think about it.

332
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,917
And I promise you
that I can offer you

333
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,166
all the support you need

334
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:10,917
to get through this pregnancy.
Just please, just consider...

335
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:16,500
Just consider
carrying the baby to term.

336
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,709
What did you say to Patty?

337
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,875
She comes here to see me

338
00:16:29,917 --> 00:16:32,041
and then you scare her
into changing her mind?

339
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:33,500
I didn't scare her.
I talked to her.

340
00:16:33,542 --> 00:16:35,000
You had no right.

341
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,375
She needed to think.

342
00:16:36,417 --> 00:16:38,959
This abortion could affect
her for the rest of her life.

343
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,291
Any choice would affect her for
the rest of her life.

344
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,583
All the more reason
to be sure of her decision.

345
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,792
You don't get an opinion,
you don't work here.

346
00:16:45,834 --> 00:16:47,500
Which makes me
the objective person.

347
00:16:47,542 --> 00:16:49,125
The patient was made aware
of her options

348
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,166
and she chose.
End of story.

349
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,041
Sheldon:
This isn't some clinical trial

350
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,750
where we line up
the pros and cons.

351
00:16:54,792 --> 00:16:57,709
There's an emotional component
here that can't be quantified.

352
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,000
It's not just emotional,
this is physical.

353
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:02,500
When you crush that baby's skull
to get it through the cervix,

354
00:17:02,542 --> 00:17:04,041
it feels that pain.

355
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,041
You don't think I know that?

356
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,041
I don't think you care.

357
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:09,041
Of course I care.
But Patty is my patient.

358
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,208
You violated the trust

359
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,959
that I established
with my patient.

360
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,041
My patient. You have crossed
so far over the line,

361
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,250
you can't even see it.

362
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:17,667
I did what I thought was right.

363
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:19,166
Whether or not to do
this procedure

364
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,041
is not your decision,
it is mine.

365
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,542
I thought it was Patty's.

366
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,875
You didn't wanna do it anyway.
And now you don't have to.

367
00:17:24,917 --> 00:17:26,041
Don't pretend you did this
for me.

368
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:29,041
You manipulated a terrified
and confused girl.

369
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,208
Preach whatever you want
to your own patients,

370
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,041
but stay away from mine.

371
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,166
How's Betsey doing?

372
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,041
Her intracranial pressure
is holding steady,

373
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,041
so no surgery yet.

374
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:46,041
Honestly, for once
I don't wanna cut.

375
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,625
I get that.
It's a tricky procedure.

376
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,458
Besides, Betsey is just a kid.

377
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,208
And her father died on my table.

378
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:57,083
What happened with Dell
was not your fault.

379
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,000
You don't really
blame yourself, do you?

380
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,041
I don't know. I just--

381
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,583
I've got a little girl
in the icu

382
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,041
and all I can think about,

383
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:09,917
all I can focus on,
is how badly I want a drink.

384
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,500
My mama always says,

385
00:18:12,542 --> 00:18:14,041
"god doesn't give
with both hands."

386
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:17,083
You're young, beautiful,
brilliant.

387
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,000
Has to be something
you can't have.

388
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,500
Some days I'd give all that up.

389
00:18:21,542 --> 00:18:23,083
That's just the craving talking.

390
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,041
But the longer you go
without a drink--

391
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:29,500
I drank at your wedding.
I thought it was ginger ale.

392
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:33,041
I spit it out.
Okay.

393
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:36,041
Since then?
Nothing.

394
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,959
But I can't stop thinking
about it.

395
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,750
It was an accident.

396
00:18:39,792 --> 00:18:41,125
Don't turn a slip
into a fall.

397
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:44,709
Get your butt to a meeting.

398
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,041
I will.

399
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,000
I gotta go watch Betsey
a little longer.

400
00:18:56,959 --> 00:18:59,333
Hey. Are you okay?
No.

401
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:03,041
You know, Betsey's just a kid,
she's suffered a trauma,

402
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,375
so give her some time.

403
00:19:04,417 --> 00:19:05,667
Time won't change the fact

404
00:19:05,709 --> 00:19:08,000
that Pete
didn't let me keep her.

405
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,083
Look, I'm all for blaming Pete
when it's justified,

406
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,875
but this is not his fault.

407
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:14,291
If you wanted to adopt Betsey,
you could have fought harder.

408
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,041
You've been married
for a minute and a half,

409
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,125
what do you know?

410
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,041
Okay, do you want a shoulder
or the truth?

411
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:22,000
Spit it out.
Okay.

412
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:24,041
After Betsey left,
you didn't visit her.

413
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,417
None of us did.

414
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,291
But you judged us
for not coming to her rescue.

415
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,000
You played the guilt card,
the responsibility card.

416
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,041
You made her your mission.

417
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:35,750
And then the social worker
takes her away and,

418
00:19:35,792 --> 00:19:37,834
you know, out of sight,
out of mind.

419
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:44,041
Oh, god. I'm vile. I'm selfish.
I am selfish and vile.

420
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,000
Come on, Violet.
We all failed Betsey.

421
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:50,250
We just have to figure out
how to help her now.

422
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:55,792
You have to know that
we didn't-- we could never--

423
00:19:55,834 --> 00:19:57,959
where do they get off
accusing us of hurting her?

424
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,792
Look, we all just want
what's best for her.

425
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:04,875
I should probably take
Marshall home.

426
00:20:04,917 --> 00:20:06,041
You're leaving?

427
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,583
I'm staying with you,
honey, okay?

428
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,000
Hug your sister, hmm?

429
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,583
I need some help in here.
Phil: What's happening?

430
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,041
Pete:
Ten milligrams of lorazepam.

431
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,750
She was fine.
I don't understand.

432
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:22,959
Amelia: What's going on?
Icp is off the chart.

433
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,375
We need to get her
into surgery now.

434
00:20:24,417 --> 00:20:25,500
Pete:
Come on.

435
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:29,208
I'm going with her.
I should go too, but Marshall.

436
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,625
You both go, I'll stay with him.
Thank you.

437
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:39,041
Will Betsey be okay?
Dr. Shepherd is the best.

438
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,375
She'll do everything she can.
You have to make her okay.

439
00:20:41,417 --> 00:20:43,250
You have to. You promised.

440
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:46,041
Make her okay!
Make Betsey better!

441
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:49,500
Make her better! You promised!
You said you will!

442
00:20:49,542 --> 00:20:51,000
Make her better!

443
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,834
Sheldon: Hey, Pete.
Hey.

444
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:01,041
Who's your
friend?

445
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:04,041
This is Marshall,
Betsey's foster brother.

446
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:05,291
Mommy says we don't
say "foster."

447
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,041
Sheldon:
Of course. I'm Sheldon.

448
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,000
Hey, can I join you?
Pete: Sure.

449
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:15,250
Sheldon:
You and Betsey
are about the same age.

450
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,125
Must be nice to have her
living with you.

451
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:20,000
Yeah. It's fun.

452
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:25,834
Uh, hey, listen.
I gotta check on a patient.

453
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:28,333
Do you mind? I'll be back
in a couple of minutes.

454
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:34,083
Now, I'm sure you got upset
by what happened to Betsey,

455
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:37,041
but the doctors here
are very good.

456
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:39,291
They're gonna take
great care of her.

457
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:47,166
Does your dad ever get upset?
Sometimes.

458
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:53,041
But does he get more upset
now that Betsey lives with you?

459
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,000
He fights with mommy a lot more.

460
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:59,166
And mommy gets sad.

461
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:01,750
I don't like it.
Of course not.

462
00:22:01,792 --> 00:22:02,792
You love your mom.

463
00:22:03,917 --> 00:22:05,917
So, what do you do
to make her happy?

464
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:08,792
I'm an extra good boy
so she knows I love her.

465
00:22:08,834 --> 00:22:11,083
I tell Betsey to be
extra good too,

466
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,625
and to listen
to daddy and mommy.

467
00:22:12,667 --> 00:22:15,041
And when Betsey
doesn't listen,

468
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,041
does your dad do more
than just talk to her?

469
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:19,750
Does he spank her or...?

470
00:22:19,792 --> 00:22:22,625
No.
Sheldon: What about your mom?

471
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:26,333
Is she ever mean to Betsey?
No.

472
00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:31,750
But sometimes I help her
to listen.

473
00:22:37,542 --> 00:22:38,834
How do you do that?

474
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:43,000
Is that what you did
on the jungle gym?

475
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:45,667
Betsey's clumsy.

476
00:22:46,792 --> 00:22:47,792
It was her fault.

477
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:53,041
And when Betsey misbehaves,
I guess that's her fault too.

478
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:54,709
Must make it harder
for your parents.

479
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,041
Yeah.

480
00:22:58,083 --> 00:22:59,208
And that's not right.

481
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:04,583
So I guess it makes sense, then,
that she needs to be punished.

482
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:15,000
I'm done with my ice cream.
Can I have more?

483
00:23:24,959 --> 00:23:27,208
Charlotte: How's it going?
Amelia: It's tricky.

484
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,500
The hematoma's on the tip
of the left temporal lobe.

485
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:31,041
If I remove
more than four centimeters,

486
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:33,625
she'll have persistent
speech problems.

487
00:23:35,917 --> 00:23:37,041
You checking up on me?

488
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,834
Worried I'm not competent
to do this?

489
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,834
Actually, I have complete
faith in you.

490
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:43,417
I'm just worried you lost faith
in yourself.

491
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:45,917
Amelia:
Sooner or later
this kid's gotta catch a break.

492
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:48,750
Dell did everything for Betsey
and it still all went bad.

493
00:23:48,792 --> 00:23:51,041
Why do you think having kids
scares the crap out of me?

494
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:53,834
Cooper must want them.
Charlotte: Of course.

495
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,291
He's giving me the time
to get onboard.

496
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,041
That's nice.

497
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:59,750
Addison had to choose between
having a kid and being with Sam.

498
00:23:59,792 --> 00:24:02,041
Now she's got neither.

499
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:05,000
You're lucky to have a man
like Coop.

500
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:09,000
Got it.

501
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:14,041
What's wrong?
Damn, there's a bleed.

502
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:16,333
I need to remove more
of the temporal lobe to stop it.

503
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:17,875
If I am off
by one centimeter--

504
00:24:17,917 --> 00:24:19,041
Amelia, this is
what you do.

505
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,667
Don't think,
just do it.

506
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,000
I knew Betsey
was holding back.

507
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:28,792
Marshall didn't admit
to pushing her.

508
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:30,959
He didn't have to.
The way he talked about Betsey

509
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,166
and his aggressiveness
with Pete.

510
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:34,000
Marshall's been hurting Betsey.

511
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:36,750
I can't believe it.
The kid's only eight years old.

512
00:24:36,792 --> 00:24:39,041
Well, did Marshall feel
any guilt at all?

513
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:40,041
He justifies his actions

514
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:41,959
under the guise
of protecting his mother.

515
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,959
And there's a pride
he associates

516
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,083
with being a good boy.

517
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:47,083
So the kid's a psychopath.
No, no one is saying that.

518
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:49,041
There's a reason why
we don't diagnose kids

519
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:51,041
with antisocial
personality disorder.

520
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:53,041
The prefrontal cortex
doesn't really develop

521
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:54,583
till we're in our 20s.
I know that.

522
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:56,041
Violet:
While the brain is maturing,

523
00:24:56,083 --> 00:24:57,750
he could be learning ways
to hurt people.

524
00:24:57,792 --> 00:24:59,041
Therapy?
Possibly.

525
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:01,500
Maybe he needs more love
and attention.

526
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:03,166
Violet:
Why are we worrying
about Marshall?

527
00:25:03,208 --> 00:25:04,750
Betsey's the one
we care about.

528
00:25:04,792 --> 00:25:06,166
Recent history
notwithstanding.

529
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:09,083
We didn't give up on Betsey.
Okay? You weren't here.

530
00:25:09,125 --> 00:25:12,333
It was difficult and complicated
and you weren't here.

531
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:24,208
You need to keep Marshall
away from Betsey.

532
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:27,041
What are you talking about?
Marshall loves his sister.

533
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:29,166
You're not involved in this.
Yes, I am.

534
00:25:29,208 --> 00:25:30,625
I'm the one who promised Betsey

535
00:25:30,667 --> 00:25:32,834
she would be safe
in foster care.
She is.

536
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:34,542
There's something wrong
with Marshall.

537
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:35,625
Who are you?

538
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:37,041
Sheldon Wallace.
I'm a psychiatrist.

539
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:38,333
Of course you are.

540
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:40,542
Betsey's intracranial
pressure spiked

541
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:42,250
when Marshall
was about to hug her.

542
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:43,542
She's clearly afraid of him.

543
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,041
You've never even talked
to Marshall.

544
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:46,542
I spent time with him
earlier.

545
00:25:46,583 --> 00:25:49,041
And I really do believe
that he's trying to hurt her.

546
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:52,041
Wait. You interrogated
our son?

547
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:54,250
He was trying to protect
your daughter.

548
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:56,041
Phil:
What kind of doctors are you?

549
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:59,000
We've heard enough. Get out
of here or I'll call security.

550
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:03,083
How is she? How's Betsey?
She's out of surgery.

551
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:06,917
She's stable,
but she's in a coma.

552
00:26:18,917 --> 00:26:20,667
I've been calling you all day.

553
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:23,917
I know.

554
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:25,041
I just needed some time.

555
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,834
I just wanted to apologize
for Dr. Bennett.

556
00:26:27,875 --> 00:26:30,458
She had no right
to upset you like that.

557
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:34,750
Believe me, i--

558
00:26:34,792 --> 00:26:36,250
I just wanna make sure
that you're okay

559
00:26:36,291 --> 00:26:38,417
and tell you
that I am here to talk,

560
00:26:38,458 --> 00:26:41,000
to listen, to help you
in any way I can.

561
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:53,000
Patty:
Dr. Montgomery?

562
00:26:55,542 --> 00:26:57,000
I don't know what to do.

563
00:27:01,083 --> 00:27:03,083
I can't tell you what to do.

564
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:05,125
I can only tell you
that it's your choice.

565
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:08,041
Maybe it shouldn't be.

566
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:10,083
But it has to be.

567
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:13,041
Patty,
when it comes to abortion,

568
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:15,041
everybody has an opinion.

569
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:17,000
Everybody's gonna wanna
tell you what to do.

570
00:27:17,041 --> 00:27:19,875
If this were 1972,
it would have been a back alley

571
00:27:19,917 --> 00:27:21,959
and not my elevator
that you would've collapsed in,

572
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,250
because back then,
you didn't have a choice.

573
00:27:24,291 --> 00:27:26,458
Now you do.

574
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,125
But it's still hard.

575
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:29,333
And even after you make

576
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:32,250
the most difficult
and personal decision

577
00:27:32,291 --> 00:27:33,667
that there is,

578
00:27:33,709 --> 00:27:37,000
it's still not safe,
because you have some fanatic

579
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:38,333
who claims to value life,

580
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:40,583
who can walk into an
abortion clinic and blow it up.

581
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:44,041
Patty, you
are the only one who knows

582
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:45,500
if you're ready
to have a child.

583
00:27:45,542 --> 00:27:48,041
Everybody else's opinion
is just background noise.

584
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,834
So if you wanna keep this baby,
I'll support you.

585
00:27:50,875 --> 00:27:53,208
You wanna give it up
for adoption, I'll help.

586
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,417
You want an abortion,
I'll do it.

587
00:27:55,458 --> 00:27:57,166
I am not here
to judge you.

588
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:58,333
I just need you to know

589
00:27:58,375 --> 00:28:01,458
that whatever
decision you make is for you.

590
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,709
Not for me,
not for Dr. Bennett.

591
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,000
For you.

592
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:19,458
Hey. Any word on Betsey?

593
00:28:20,834 --> 00:28:23,000
She still hasn't woken up.

594
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,625
I know I wasn't here

595
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:30,000
when Betsey's aunt
dropped her off

596
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,959
and maybe I should've
come back from Africa--

597
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,417
we have Olivia to take care of

598
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:36,667
and we're nowhere near
done with Maya.

599
00:28:36,709 --> 00:28:40,041
Well, as much as she'd like
to think otherwise.

600
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:42,625
I don't know.
Do you think that she'd be okay

601
00:28:42,667 --> 00:28:44,542
if we didn't see her that often?

602
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:46,000
Well, she might not
go to Columbia.

603
00:28:46,041 --> 00:28:47,041
Yeah.

604
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:48,834
On the other hand,

605
00:28:48,875 --> 00:28:52,000
New York is just a short
train ride away from D.C.

606
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:54,375
Hmm?

607
00:28:54,417 --> 00:28:56,000
Fife asked me to go back
with him. Heh.

608
00:29:01,041 --> 00:29:03,000
And are you considering it?

609
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:06,458
I know. You don't like him.
He is an arrogant ass.

610
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:10,166
I mean, I wouldn't pick him
for you.

611
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:11,542
But what do I know?

612
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:15,875
How are you doing
since you and Addison split?

613
00:29:18,083 --> 00:29:19,291
I have my good days,
bad days.

614
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:21,709
You think you two will manage
to stay friends?

615
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:25,000
You think you will?

616
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,709
You're a good mother, Gina.

617
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:39,959
You love Marshall.

618
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
You spend time with him,
you take care of him.

619
00:29:43,792 --> 00:29:45,333
You knew, didn't you?

620
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,000
He...

621
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:53,875
He doesn't have friends.

622
00:29:58,083 --> 00:30:00,000
Fights with kids at school.

623
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,041
He says they pick on him,
but the other parents,

624
00:30:04,083 --> 00:30:06,166
the guidance counselors,

625
00:30:06,208 --> 00:30:09,959
they always swear
Marshall started it.

626
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:15,375
I knew he was different,

627
00:30:15,417 --> 00:30:18,250
but you don't wanna think--

628
00:30:18,291 --> 00:30:21,125
I just-- i--
I didn't wanna see it.

629
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:25,709
I thought if we brought
another kid into our home,

630
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:27,625
he'd have someone.

631
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:29,750
A friend.

632
00:30:32,083 --> 00:30:34,125
That's not enough.

633
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,917
He needs--
Gina: More.

634
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,542
Love, attention.

635
00:30:38,583 --> 00:30:39,834
More of us.

636
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:49,000
I love you, Betsey.

637
00:31:01,458 --> 00:31:03,667
Wait.

638
00:31:03,709 --> 00:31:05,667
Betsey can't go back
in the system.

639
00:31:07,083 --> 00:31:08,917
Marshall is my son.

640
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,583
He has to come first.

641
00:31:35,417 --> 00:31:37,834
My kid would've been
six this year.

642
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:40,041
A girl.

643
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:42,000
I know it would've
been a girl.

644
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:45,250
Ella.

645
00:31:47,709 --> 00:31:49,500
She would've been
in the first grade.

646
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:54,041
She would've had the same gap
between her teeth as me.

647
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:56,166
If you have this much regret
about your own abortion,

648
00:31:56,208 --> 00:31:58,125
then how can you go through
with this?

649
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:04,000
I know that that may have been
my one chance to get pregnant.

650
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:07,208
But still...

651
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,333
For me it was

652
00:32:11,375 --> 00:32:14,041
the right decision
at the time.

653
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:15,959
I do not take this lightly,
Nai.

654
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,917
To try to separate
what I want personally

655
00:32:17,959 --> 00:32:20,750
from what I need to do
professionally

656
00:32:20,792 --> 00:32:24,083
is killing me.

657
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:27,959
I wanna strangle
the doctor

658
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,959
who botched this up
in the first place.

659
00:32:30,959 --> 00:32:32,250
We've come so far,
right?

660
00:32:32,291 --> 00:32:34,917
Then why can't Patty
get what she needs?

661
00:32:34,959 --> 00:32:39,417
A safe and legal abortion
without judgment?

662
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,500
Why does she have
to go through this again?

663
00:32:44,083 --> 00:32:45,792
Why do I have to go
through this?

664
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:50,542
I hate what I'm about to do,

665
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:54,750
but I support Patty's right
to choose.

666
00:32:54,792 --> 00:32:57,291
It is not enough
to just have an opinion,

667
00:32:57,333 --> 00:33:01,041
because in a nation
of over 300 million people,

668
00:33:01,083 --> 00:33:03,917
there are only
1,700 abortion providers.

669
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:08,000
And I'm one of them.

670
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,041
Okay, Patty. We're ready.

671
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:17,959
Are you sure
about this?

672
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,333
Yeah, I'm sure.

673
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:21,083
This is what I want.

674
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:24,208
But I'm so scared.
I know.

675
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:26,041
I'm gonna take
good care of you.

676
00:33:26,083 --> 00:33:28,041
I just feel so alone.

677
00:33:29,834 --> 00:33:32,500
You're not alone, Patty.

678
00:33:32,542 --> 00:33:34,417
You're not alone.

679
00:33:41,417 --> 00:33:43,959
Addison:
Prep tray and foley cath.

680
00:33:57,083 --> 00:33:59,000
You did everything
you could.

681
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:02,750
What if it's not enough?

682
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:05,041
What if the amount
of temporal lobe

683
00:34:05,083 --> 00:34:08,333
I removed from Betsey
damaged her brain?

684
00:34:08,375 --> 00:34:10,125
She could lose her ability
to speak,

685
00:34:10,166 --> 00:34:11,583
if she even wakes up.

686
00:34:12,709 --> 00:34:14,041
It's been a rough couple
of days.

687
00:34:14,083 --> 00:34:17,041
The hospital can reach you
if there are any changes.

688
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:18,417
Why don't we go
to a meeting?

689
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:23,041
I'm grateful
that we are friends

690
00:34:23,083 --> 00:34:24,417
and that you look out for me,
but...

691
00:34:24,458 --> 00:34:26,834
You can't worry that every time
something goes wrong,

692
00:34:26,875 --> 00:34:27,875
I'm gonna drink.

693
00:34:29,125 --> 00:34:30,667
I'm gonna stay here.

694
00:34:30,709 --> 00:34:33,834
But I will go to a meeting
with you tomorrow morning.

695
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:34,875
I promise.

696
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:09,000
Thank you.

697
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:13,041
I know that you were there
for Patty, but--

698
00:35:13,083 --> 00:35:15,000
I was there
for the both of you.

699
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:19,000
You helped that woman.

700
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:22,125
I miss you, Nai.

701
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,625
I really miss you.

702
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:27,041
When you took Patty's hand
in there

703
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,291
and told her
she wasn't alone,

704
00:35:28,333 --> 00:35:31,041
it broke my heart.

705
00:35:31,083 --> 00:35:34,375
Because I am alone.

706
00:35:34,417 --> 00:35:38,792
Somewhere along the way,
you let go of my hand.

707
00:35:39,792 --> 00:35:42,000
And being alone,
it just sucks.

708
00:35:45,083 --> 00:35:47,083
I want
my best friend back.

709
00:36:01,083 --> 00:36:03,291
You wanna get a drink?

710
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:06,375
Yeah, I do. I do.
Ha, ha.

711
00:36:06,417 --> 00:36:10,041
But, um, can I bring
some wine over later?

712
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:12,375
Sure. You have plans?

713
00:36:12,417 --> 00:36:15,542
Um, what I have are a lot
of opinions.

714
00:36:16,667 --> 00:36:18,959
It's time for me
to act on them.

715
00:36:24,083 --> 00:36:27,041
What if she doesn't wake up?

716
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:29,000
Betsey's tough.
She'll come out okay.

717
00:36:31,083 --> 00:36:34,959
What?
You. Ha, ha.

718
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,959
You never struck me
as the kid-friendly type.

719
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,834
I used to think
that anything that took me away

720
00:36:39,875 --> 00:36:42,000
from the lab
was a waste of time.

721
00:36:42,041 --> 00:36:44,041
But now, I don't know.

722
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:46,625
I guess I can see
the advantages of making space

723
00:36:46,667 --> 00:36:48,000
in my life for others.

724
00:36:51,291 --> 00:36:53,000
I can't go with you.

725
00:36:57,709 --> 00:36:59,000
I love you, Naomi.

726
00:36:59,041 --> 00:37:02,333
And I'm not sorry
I came back for you.

727
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:04,583
Because I do believe
you have to stand up

728
00:37:04,625 --> 00:37:06,375
for the things
that truly matter.

729
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:10,375
But you also gotta recognize
when you've lost.

730
00:37:12,917 --> 00:37:15,000
I'm leaving tomorrow.

731
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:35,041
She's gonna wake up,
right?

732
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:37,625
Charlotte:
She has to.

733
00:37:42,959 --> 00:37:44,667
I'm lucky to have you,
Coop.

734
00:37:46,083 --> 00:37:48,917
I don't ever want it to seem
like I take you for granted.

735
00:37:48,959 --> 00:37:51,959
We can't take anything
for granted.

736
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,208
Hey, Betsey.

737
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:27,041
It's me.

738
00:38:27,083 --> 00:38:29,000
It's Violet.

739
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:33,709
You know, you're right
to be mad at me.

740
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:37,000
Your dad would be so mad
at me too.

741
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,083
It's sad that the only way
I can talk to you

742
00:38:41,125 --> 00:38:42,375
is when you can't hear me,

743
00:38:42,417 --> 00:38:45,000
but, I don't know,
maybe you can.

744
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,625
Okay.

745
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,125
I'm sorry
that I lied to you.

746
00:38:59,041 --> 00:39:02,166
I didn't want to,
but, uh...

747
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:06,041
I was afraid that if I told you
that foster care was...

748
00:39:06,083 --> 00:39:07,083
I mean, if you thought that

749
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:09,959
where you were going
wasn't safe

750
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,291
and happy and full of love,

751
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:14,000
then it would make it harder
for you to go.

752
00:39:15,083 --> 00:39:16,709
Or maybe it would just make
it harder

753
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:17,750
for me to see you leave.

754
00:39:17,792 --> 00:39:20,041
I don't know.

755
00:39:20,083 --> 00:39:21,208
But...

756
00:39:24,083 --> 00:39:25,959
You have to know that I care.

757
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,750
And I wanted to help.

758
00:39:27,792 --> 00:39:31,041
I mean, I wanna help now.
So...

759
00:39:31,083 --> 00:39:32,291
So. Ahem.

760
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:37,208
I promise you
that I am going to find

761
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,959
some people for you
to live with

762
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
who will give you all the love
that you deserve.

763
00:39:41,041 --> 00:39:43,041
And I'm not gonna
give up this time, okay?

764
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:45,208
So you better not
give up either.

765
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:47,375
Because you have--

766
00:39:49,458 --> 00:39:52,750
you have so much life ahead
of you and you have

767
00:39:52,792 --> 00:39:56,041
so many beautiful things
to look forward to.

768
00:39:57,667 --> 00:40:00,000
But you have to wake up.

769
00:40:08,083 --> 00:40:10,041
Violet?

770
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:38,583
Man:
What can I get you?

771
00:40:42,792 --> 00:40:44,000
Vodka tonic.

772
00:40:46,083 --> 00:40:48,041
But just one.

773
00:41:11,166 --> 00:41:13,291
You're still here.

774
00:41:14,291 --> 00:41:16,041
I promised.

775
00:41:16,083 --> 00:41:19,291
Thanks for calling. Hey.

776
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:21,792
I heard you
were feeling better.

777
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Where's my mommy?

778
00:41:30,333 --> 00:41:32,000
Oh, honey.

779
00:41:33,083 --> 00:41:34,792
I'm so sorry.

780
00:41:34,834 --> 00:41:36,667
She loves you,
she does, but--

781
00:41:36,709 --> 00:41:38,542
she doesn't want me anymore.

782
00:41:40,875 --> 00:41:45,000
Will you listen? I'm gonna
find you a family, I swear.

783
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:45,959
And no matter where you are,

784
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,041
I'm gonna be a part
of your life.

785
00:41:49,083 --> 00:41:50,083
Always.

786
00:41:50,125 --> 00:41:53,041
Where am I gonna live now?

787
00:41:53,083 --> 00:41:55,208
You're coming home with me.

788
00:41:57,083 --> 00:41:58,000
She is?

789
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:00,583
For how long?

790
00:42:00,625 --> 00:42:03,000
How about forever?

791
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:05,792
Really?

792
00:42:07,083 --> 00:42:08,208
Really.

793
00:42:17,041 --> 00:42:18,375
Thank you.
