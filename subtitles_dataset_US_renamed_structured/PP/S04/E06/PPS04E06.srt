♪ Ohhh ohhh ohhh ♪

2
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:18,917
Ow. Damn it.

3
00:00:18,959 --> 00:00:20,375
You okay?

4
00:00:20,417 --> 00:00:23,333
Yeah, I'm okay.

5
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:24,542
What are you doing?

6
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:26,041
I'm making Lucas
a Halloween costume.

7
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:29,041
I'm trying to make Lucas
a Halloween costume.

8
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:30,458
Ow.

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,583
Uh, you know, I think
they sell costumes.

10
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:38,041
My mother made these really
great Halloween costumes.

11
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:40,041
My fourth-grade sunflower
won first prize.

12
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:41,333
No, and then one year

13
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,959
I was raggedy Ann and she made
these authentic pantaloons

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
with a wig made
out of red yarn and--

15
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:47,834
well, she actually sewed
me into the pantaloons

16
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:49,667
and then told me that
I couldn't get out of them,

17
00:00:49,709 --> 00:00:52,333
so, um, I peed my pants
trick-or-treating

18
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:53,500
and was humiliated

19
00:00:53,542 --> 00:00:55,041
because she's a sadistic
narcissist

20
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:57,041
with serious intimacy issues,

21
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:59,750
but she made
really great costumes.

22
00:01:01,959 --> 00:01:03,083
Did you--?
Did you dress up?

23
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:05,000
You ever go out
trick-or-treating

24
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:06,041
with your brother?

25
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:08,291
Adam and I used
to egg trick or treaters.

26
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:10,250
Oh.

27
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:11,375
Was that fun?

28
00:01:11,417 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm late for the er.

29
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:16,166
Hey, big man.

30
00:01:18,667 --> 00:01:21,083
All:
Uh-oh.

31
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:23,000
Bye. Mwah.
Uh-oh.

32
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:29,125
You smell good.

33
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:30,250
Mm.

34
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:32,709
I taste even better. Ha, ha.

35
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:39,291
What are you doing?

36
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,166
It's called foreplay.

37
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:44,959
Stop looking at my stomach
like that.

38
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:47,041
Like what?

39
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:48,959
Like you're trying to picture
a baby in there.

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,458
Oh, I'm doing no such thing.

41
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,750
Oh-- Charlotte.

42
00:01:55,542 --> 00:01:56,917
Don't be that way.

43
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:08,041
Sam:
He's been coming every day
for how long?

44
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:10,125
Grant:
Two years ago, weekend ski trip,

45
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:13,041
Georgie hit a tree,
never regained consciousness.

46
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:15,250
None of the neuro guys
gave him much hope,

47
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:16,959
but you're always good
with referrals

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,083
and so I just thought, maybe--

49
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:20,750
we could help him
come to terms with this.

50
00:02:21,834 --> 00:02:23,917
Grant:
He hasn't let go. At all.

51
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:25,917
Amelia will be honest with him.

52
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:29,917
Oh. Uh, bright lights
don't do much for Georgie,

53
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:31,667
but she likes
being talked to.

54
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:35,709
See? You can say
it's just a reflex,

55
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,959
all the other doctors did,

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,959
but I know
it's more than that.

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,500
The trauma to your wife's head

58
00:02:41,542 --> 00:02:43,709
damaged her reticular
activating system,

59
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,166
which controls
her level of consciousness.

60
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,500
Like waking up. I know.

61
00:02:48,542 --> 00:02:49,834
Then you also know

62
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:52,041
that it is hard to determine
how extensive the damage is?

63
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,959
Which means I could be right,

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,542
she hears me
and responds to me.

65
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:58,125
Amelia:
It's possible, but

66
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:01,041
Georgie is only manifesting
very primitive reactions.

67
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:02,959
I mean, a twitch, a blink.

68
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,625
After all this time,
that doesn't bode well.

69
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:08,333
Look, I can run
a bunch of tests, but--

70
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,000
uh, then run them.

71
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:14,417
I don't want you to get
your hopes up, Mr. Schwartz.

72
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,041
My hopes are already up.

73
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,041
They have to be.

74
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,250
Run the tests.

75
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:29,834
Pete:
What have we got?

76
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:32,166
Mva. Car versus pole. Two males.

77
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,542
Jacob Deever, 43 years old,
wearing seatbelt.

78
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:37,041
Minor facial lacerations
and a bruised arm.

79
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,041
Twenty-two-year-old Evan Arnold,
unrestrained.

80
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,709
Closed head trauma
and possible fractured tibia.

81
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:45,458
Hey, look, really I'm fine.
I don't need to be here.

82
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,875
Mr. Deever, I'm Dr. Wilder.
We're gonna help you out,

83
00:03:47,917 --> 00:03:49,250
but I need you
to relax for just a minute

84
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,000
while I examine
the other driver.

85
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,458
We were in the same car.
He, uh-- Evan.

86
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,625
He hit his head
on the windshield.

87
00:03:55,667 --> 00:03:57,291
Okay, let's get
a c-spine, chest,

88
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,083
a pelvic trauma panel
and a head ct.

89
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,875
Either of you have
anything to drink?

90
00:04:00,917 --> 00:04:02,000
What? No.

91
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,250
No, I-I just happened
to take my eyes

92
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:04,458
off the road for a second.

93
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,917
What about drugs,
prescription or otherwise?

94
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,792
No, no. God, no. You know what?

95
00:04:08,834 --> 00:04:10,875
I have an appointment
that I need to get to, so--

96
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,834
okay, let me just get someone

97
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,333
to clean up that scrape
on your head and--

98
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,625
no. No, it's good. I'm actually
fine. I just need to go.

99
00:04:16,667 --> 00:04:18,917
You have the right
to refuse treatment,

100
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,125
but you're gonna have to talk to
the police about the accident.

101
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,041
Why don't you wait for me
at the nurses' station?

102
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,333
I'll get your statement,
then you can go.

103
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:31,041
He seems pretty antsy.

104
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,291
Should we hold him
for a tox screen?

105
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,041
That's not why he's nervous.

106
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,250
I know this guy that he's with.

107
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,500
Arrested him a couple times
in the past few months.

108
00:04:37,542 --> 00:04:38,959
He's a prostitute.

109
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,500
Hey. You wanna see
something funky?

110
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:53,792
Thirty-three-year-old woman,
Georgie Schwartz,

111
00:04:53,834 --> 00:04:55,917
persistent vegetative state
for over 24 months.

112
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:59,291
Looks like the case study
from my neuroanatomy final.

113
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,041
I hated neuroanatomy.

114
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,583
Just skip down to the labs.

115
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:07,542
Her tsh is low, but her thyroid
levels look fine.

116
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:08,875
I don't get it.

117
00:05:08,917 --> 00:05:14,000
Hmm. Iron-deficient anemia. Hmm.

118
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,792
You're focusing
on the wrong organ.

119
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:18,959
Your patient's pregnant.

120
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:22,417
All I did was put my hand
on her stomach.

121
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:25,083
Which is usually the prelude
to a little something-something.

122
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,000
She's got me boxed in.

123
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,000
I know the feeling.

124
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,083
You and Pete aren't having sex?

125
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:32,375
Uh, no. We have a lot of sex.

126
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:34,959
Sorry. No, I just meant
the boxed-in part.

127
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,208
Okay, I'm gonna, um--

128
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:41,750
I'm gonna tell you something,

129
00:05:41,792 --> 00:05:45,041
but you can't ever,
never ever, tell anyone.

130
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,125
Never ever.

131
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:49,750
Okay.

132
00:05:49,792 --> 00:05:51,166
Never ever.

133
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,250
Never ever.

134
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:56,875
Pete's mother...

135
00:05:58,667 --> 00:06:00,458
She's in prison.

136
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,250
What?

137
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,250
What, like "prison" prison?

138
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,041
What'd she do?
She like a bunny boiler?

139
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,250
Or like Bonnie and Clyde?

140
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,834
I don't know.
He won't talk about her.

141
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,542
He's got a brother,
he won't talk about him.

142
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:16,041
Which is obviously wrong.
He should tell me this stuff.

143
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:21,041
I should know about it, right?
I mean, I'm his wife.

144
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,500
What'd you do?

145
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:29,041
Nothing.

146
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,625
Violet Maryann Turner.

147
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,959
Okay, I googled.

148
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:44,709
There are 33 Adam Wilders.

149
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,208
Mm-hm.

150
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,041
So you think
we can start trying?

151
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:50,625
Oh, you're healed
from your bladder reconstruction

152
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:52,208
and your kidney function's
back to normal.

153
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,458
I think you'd be crazy not to.

154
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,375
Laying in that hospital bed,
this always felt so far away.

155
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:00,834
Sometimes I thought
it would never happen.

156
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:03,041
But now, I'm ready--

157
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,959
we're ready. --For a baby.

158
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,500
If you want my advice,

159
00:07:07,542 --> 00:07:09,458
forget about ovulation days
and thermometers

160
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,542
and just have fun.

161
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,333
I can't wait to tell my husband.

162
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:17,834
Hon?

163
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:21,208
Dr. King,
this is my husband, Jacob.

164
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,208
Nice to meet you.

165
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,458
So nice to meet you.

166
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,709
You okay?
Yeah.

167
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,000
Good.

168
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:36,583
Charlotte:
Enjoy.

169
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,000
Thanks again.

170
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,500
Hey, Charlotte.

171
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,458
Do you know that guy?

172
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,458
He's the husband
of one of my patients.

173
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,000
Is something wrong?

174
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:51,709
He was in the er
a couple of hours ago

175
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,583
with a male prostitute.

176
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,667
Are you sure?

177
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:59,083
They were in a car accident.
Same car.

178
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:02,375
Angela just spent a year in hell
having her bladder reconstructed

179
00:08:02,417 --> 00:08:04,041
so she could have
a baby with that man.

180
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,041
If he's out there
rubbing on some guy,

181
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,125
she needs to know.

182
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:09,041
Right. Before we destroy
both their lives,

183
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,500
don't you think
we should figure out

184
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:11,959
exactly what's going on?

185
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,083
A married man gets into a car
wreck on his lunch hour

186
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:17,041
with some hustler
in the other seat.

187
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:21,000
Yeah, let's give him
the benefit of the doubt.

188
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:32,208
So I narrowed it down
to three Adam Wilders.

189
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,291
Oh, no, this is so him.

190
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,291
Do you think so?

191
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:35,542
Yeah.

192
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,542
Is that Pete in college?

193
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:37,583
See?

194
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,208
What?

195
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,917
We're looking
for Pete's brother--

196
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,083
Cooper.

197
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,250
Did you remember "never ever"?

198
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,333
Never ever.

199
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Sorry.

200
00:08:48,834 --> 00:08:50,458
Never ever will I mention this.

201
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,041
Thank you.
Is he missing?

202
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,000
He's-- he's estranged.

203
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:56,000
Maybe not for long.

204
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:58,041
Pete doesn't know
that you're doing this?

205
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,500
Well, there's no harm
in looking.

206
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:02,250
What would Pete's response be?

207
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,417
Well, if I told him
it was for his own good--

208
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:07,041
then I'd say,
why are you the one doing this?

209
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:10,000
And once you find him,
what's the plan?

210
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,291
Is that--?

211
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:22,959
The baby's heartbeat.

212
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,041
I'm sorry.

213
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,417
Oh, my god.

214
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,250
Grant:
Can I talk to you for a minute?

215
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:32,500
Yeah.

216
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,041
I don't know how this happened.

217
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,625
It's pretty clear
how it happened.

218
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:44,250
We've never had a problem
like this here.

219
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,500
We screen every staff member.
We do background checks.

220
00:09:46,542 --> 00:09:48,083
I've helped take care of their
patients.

221
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,500
It's not that kind of place.

222
00:09:49,542 --> 00:09:51,208
You still need to call
the police.

223
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,500
If you can just give me
a chance to figure this out.

224
00:09:53,542 --> 00:09:55,834
Someone here had sex
with a comatose woman.

225
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,041
That's a crime.

226
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,875
Sam:
Georgie's not
the only victim here.

227
00:09:58,917 --> 00:10:00,041
What does that mean?

228
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,667
Look at her husband.
The man's destroyed.

229
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:04,125
Our primary interest
here should be

230
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:05,667
in doing what's best
for the couple.

231
00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:07,208
They've already been
through one trauma.

232
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,250
Instead of putting
them through another,

233
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:11,834
which Bob would have
to handle on his own,

234
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,125
we need to protect them,
Addison.

235
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,333
Don't even think about it.

236
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:34,041
Do not shut that door.

237
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,709
Do not close those blinds.

238
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,500
Cooper, do not take
your pants off.

239
00:10:39,542 --> 00:10:40,792
We're in the middle of a fight.

240
00:10:40,834 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm calling a truce.

241
00:10:46,792 --> 00:10:49,041
Good luck with that.

242
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,166
Cooper:
You don't--

243
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,208
What?
You know what.

244
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,208
I do?

245
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,917
We should have called
the police.

246
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,417
Ahh. You're still talking
about the case?

247
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,333
I was right and you were wrong.

248
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:11,500
Okay.

249
00:11:11,542 --> 00:11:13,750
Okay, I was right?

250
00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:17,041
Okay, you have your opinion,
I have mine.

251
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,959
That was at work,
we're at home now,

252
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,500
so let's not talk
about it anymore

253
00:11:20,542 --> 00:11:21,917
until we're at work again.

254
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:24,041
What? What is that?
Does that actually work for you?

255
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,083
Leave work at work?

256
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,083
Well, yeah.
That's what me and Naomi--

257
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,083
I am not Naomi.
I know. I know that.

258
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,041
All right, I am mad, Sam.
I know.

259
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:33,458
My mad doesn't go away
just because I'm at home.

260
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,041
I take my work home with me.

261
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,041
Addison, come on.

262
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,041
I was right and you were wrong.

263
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:41,667
You know what?
Go home. To your own bed.

264
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:42,875
No sex for you.

265
00:11:42,917 --> 00:11:44,000
Wait, wait, wait.

266
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,166
So you're punishing
me for having

267
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:46,792
an opposing
professional opinion

268
00:11:46,834 --> 00:11:48,959
by withholding
sexual favors? Really?

269
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,458
No sex for you.

270
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:01,000
Good night, Addison.
Ha, ha.

271
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,792
Look, uh...

272
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:13,458
You know, I really appreciate
you not calling Angela.

273
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,375
You know, i--
if she knew about...

274
00:12:18,417 --> 00:12:20,375
It was just a lapse of judgment.

275
00:12:20,417 --> 00:12:22,041
But I was at the gas station,

276
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,458
he asked for a ride
and he seemed harmless, so--

277
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,125
Mr. Deever, don't talk
to me like I'm an idiot.

278
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,125
Well, what exactly
do you think happened?

279
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:37,709
Evan's a prostitute.
I think you paid him for sex.

280
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,291
You think?

281
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:46,041
Look, I've been married
to my wife for almost 20 years.

282
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,917
I love her.

283
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:50,917
I would never cheat on her.

284
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,583
And with a man?
That's disgusting.

285
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,291
Are you kidding me
right now?

286
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,542
I'm not here to judge you.

287
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,250
I just want you to understand
that Dr. King

288
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,000
is ready
to talk to your wife.

289
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:06,166
You leave Angela out of this.
She is none of your business.

290
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,166
And, Dr. Wilder,
nothing happened

291
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:11,458
between me and that man.

292
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,417
You hear me? Nothing.

293
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,083
This... it doesn't seem real.

294
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:26,083
You must feel...

295
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:29,041
Actually, I don't know
how you must feel,

296
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,125
but I want you to know

297
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:32,083
that I will do everything
I can for your wife.

298
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,792
I'd like to do a full
examination as soon as possible,

299
00:13:34,834 --> 00:13:36,500
and then
I don't see any reason

300
00:13:36,542 --> 00:13:39,792
why we can't terminate
the pregnancy immediately.

301
00:13:39,834 --> 00:13:42,417
Wait. Why?

302
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,291
Oh, I'm sorry.

303
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:47,041
I-I didn't even ask
about your religious beliefs.

304
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,583
I-i--
I just assumed that,

305
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,083
given how this happened
to Georgie--

306
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,083
no, no.

307
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:53,500
Why are you talking
about this like

308
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:55,000
it's a terrible thing?

309
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,667
Mr. Schwartz, do you understand
that Georgie is pregnant

310
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:05,750
because someone went into her
room and impregnated her?

311
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:10,166
Not someone, Dr. Montgomery,

312
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:12,083
it was me.

313
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,250
The woman is in a coma, Sam.

314
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:21,834
She can't move or speak.

315
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,041
Which means she cannot consent.

316
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,667
They're husband and wife.

317
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:26,041
You think that being married
means

318
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,250
you don't have
the right to say no?

319
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:28,583
No, I'm not saying that.

320
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:31,041
The man climbed on top
of a comatose woman--

321
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,750
all right,
I am not defending what Bob did,

322
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:35,458
but the man is broken.

323
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,834
I mean, you look at him,

324
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,458
you see how
he interacts with her.

325
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,667
He needs counseling,

326
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:42,041
a way to accept
that she's not coming back.

327
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,333
Bob Schwartz is a sick,
twisted, pervert, right?

328
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,333
Please, tell him.

329
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,583
The husband could be using sex

330
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:47,792
as an outlet for his grief.

331
00:14:47,834 --> 00:14:49,667
Or if he
truly believes his wife

332
00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:51,083
can feel
and she can respond--

333
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,500
I've seen it before with the
families of comatose patients.

334
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:55,500
They suffer a loss
that they cannot accept

335
00:14:55,542 --> 00:14:56,709
and they try to ignore it.

336
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,041
These situations are
complicated.

337
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,583
It's not complicated.

338
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,875
We call the police
and they arrest this guy.

339
00:15:01,917 --> 00:15:03,041
Sam:
Oh, come on, Addison.

340
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:06,041
He is god knows how far
into an emotional breakdown.

341
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,667
He's not out to harm her.

342
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:11,041
He's deluded.
He bathes her, he feeds her--

343
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:14,041
he violates her, and now he's
expecting her to have this baby.

344
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,041
I have seen a lot of things
since I became a doctor,

345
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,583
but this is unimaginable.

346
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,041
Have the baby? What, is that
possible with her in a coma?

347
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,041
Probably not.
It's happened.

348
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:25,208
Rarely, and Georgie's already
at risk of throwing an embolus.

349
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,917
Pregnancy would increase
that tenfold.

350
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,208
I'm not saying I think that
Georgie should have the baby--

351
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,625
well, unfortunately, Georgie
doesn't have a say in this,

352
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:33,041
and after I'm done,
neither will Bob.

353
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,208
What are you gonna do?

354
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,709
Take him to court?

355
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,500
Try and strip him
of medical power of attorney?

356
00:15:37,542 --> 00:15:39,500
If I have to, yes.
Addison.

357
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:41,834
You really disagree with me
on this, Sam? Really?

358
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,250
Sheldon:
Let me to talk to him.

359
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:46,041
Maybe I can help him understand
why he's doing what he's doing.

360
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,125
I'll chaperone.

361
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:50,041
We're all pushing in the same
direction, Addison.

362
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,667
All right.
I'll give you a day. One day.

363
00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:56,500
And we're not all pushing
in the same direction, Sam.

364
00:15:56,542 --> 00:15:58,875
I am right. You're wrong.

365
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,041
How'd your meeting
go with Jacob?

366
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:12,375
He claims he didn't know
Evan was a prostitute.

367
00:16:12,417 --> 00:16:13,542
Do you believe him?

368
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,041
Should I?

369
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,917
I tested Jacob's blood for HIV.

370
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:21,083
Charlotte, you can't test
someone's blood

371
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,083
without their permission.

372
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,709
He came into my hospital.

373
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,917
I'm the chief of staff.

374
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,083
It doesn't give you
the right to--

375
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:27,792
he's positive.

376
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:33,125
And in case you're curious,

377
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,375
I checked
Angela's blood too.

378
00:16:35,417 --> 00:16:36,959
She's negative.

379
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,792
We have to tell her.

380
00:16:39,834 --> 00:16:41,500
They're actively trying
to have a child.

381
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:42,917
It can't come from us.

382
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,166
They made a damn law
that allows us to do it, Pete.

383
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,417
Allows, doesn't require.

384
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,542
Why are you still trying
to protect this guy?

385
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:51,792
I'm not,

386
00:16:51,834 --> 00:16:53,041
but yanking Jacob
out of the closet

387
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,417
isn't gonna help either of them.

388
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:57,709
You and I both know
how devastating that would be.

389
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,125
Give me time with Jacob.

390
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,041
Let me get him to see

391
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,542
that he has to be
the one to tell her.

392
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:05,875
That he owes it to her,
to himself, to tell the truth.

393
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,083
How's the investigation?

394
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,250
Adam Wilder, lawyer in valencia.

395
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,250
Mm-hm.

396
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:24,792
He looks okay, doesn't he?

397
00:17:24,834 --> 00:17:26,250
Seems normal.

398
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:27,542
Pete's been so elusive.

399
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,500
I was expecting
america's most wanted.

400
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,959
Okay.

401
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Read that.

402
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:37,709
"My name is Violet Turner

403
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,625
and I am married to your
brother, Pete."

404
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:42,291
Yeah. No. You cannot
send this e-mail.

405
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,709
Pete wants this.

406
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,041
He just-- he just doesn't know
that he wants it.

407
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,834
Oh, come on,
it'll be one of those things.

408
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:48,917
I'll do it, he'll get pissed

409
00:17:48,959 --> 00:17:50,291
and then he'll thank me
for it later on.

410
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,792
This is Pete.

411
00:17:51,834 --> 00:17:53,834
You remember Pete? The man still
hates his dead wife.

412
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,000
Not a forgiver.

413
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,250
He's in pain, Cooper.

414
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:59,041
No, you should have seen him.
He's in pain.

415
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,083
And I wanna help him.
I have to help him.

416
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:03,041
Is this helping?

417
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,041
You press send, that is contact.

418
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:09,000
You can't undo it.

419
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,709
So am I sleeping here tonight
or next door?

420
00:18:28,917 --> 00:18:29,917
Whatever.

421
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:50,083
So, what, we're ignoring
each other now?

422
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:53,083
I am trying not to say things
I can't take back.

423
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,917
Addison, Bob Schwartz--

424
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:58,375
I am trying not to say things
I can't take back.

425
00:18:58,417 --> 00:19:05,291
Bob Schwartz has nothing to do
with you and me, here and now.

426
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:06,917
How can you act like
nothing's wrong?

427
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:08,083
Like today didn't even happen?

428
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:09,500
We disagreed about something.

429
00:19:09,542 --> 00:19:10,875
A huge something.

430
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:13,959
Look, Addison,
if working with you means

431
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,959
we can only be together
when we agree--

432
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,500
sex. You wanna have sex.
Is that all you think about?

433
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:22,125
Yeah, Addison. That's all I ever
think about. All day long.

434
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:25,333
How I can't wait to get home
and have sex with you.

435
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,417
Then let's do it.
Come on, let's have sex.

436
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,792
I'll lie here, dead and still,

437
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:32,959
and you can have all the sex
you want with my body.

438
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,625
Go ahead, knock yourself out.
Have a ball.

439
00:19:34,667 --> 00:19:36,166
We'll be like
Bob and Georgie Schwartz.

440
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,417
Or is that something
that you and Nai used to do too?

441
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:50,000
I told you I was trying not
to say things I can't take back.

442
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,250
You should have tried harder.

443
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:05,041
You know what I love
about this place?

444
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,834
None of this toting
around thermoses,

445
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:10,959
just good old environmentally
unsound, non-biodegradable,

446
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,458
here-for-a-thousand-years
plastic bottles.

447
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,125
Where are you off to
all cheerful this morning?

448
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:21,000
Sheldon and I are gonna go talk
to your buddy Bob Schwartz.

449
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,000
Is Sam going with you?

450
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,750
Shouldn't you know that?

451
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,500
We're fighting over that case.

452
00:20:33,542 --> 00:20:34,834
Seriously?

453
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,458
He is wrong.

454
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,041
And he compared me to Naomi.

455
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,041
Well, he didn't really,

456
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:43,041
but he kind of did
and then i-- whatever.

457
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,875
We're arguing about
the case and he's wrong.

458
00:20:45,917 --> 00:20:49,583
You know he has a right
to his own medical opinion?

459
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,625
If I could come home
to a guy like that,

460
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,750
I would not be wasting my time
arguing about work.

461
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:19,750
Why can't you just
stay out of my life? Hmm?

462
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:21,583
Please.

463
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,333
Pete:
You didn't return my call.

464
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:28,291
Okay, you are
not listening to me.

465
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:29,458
You're HIV positive.

466
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,041
What?

467
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:35,583
What are you talking about?

468
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:38,000
We took blood from you
when you were in the er.

469
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:40,959
Well, that just can't be.

470
00:21:55,792 --> 00:21:58,000
So, what?

471
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:03,583
God, what am I supposed
to do now?

472
00:22:05,417 --> 00:22:07,625
There's someone I'd like you
to talk to.

473
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,041
Amelia:
Bob? What happened?

474
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:20,291
She started bleeding. At first,
just a little and then--

475
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:22,083
I'm having trouble
keeping her pressure up.

476
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:24,083
Start a second line.
I'm calling Addison.

477
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:25,709
Are you sure she's the best one?

478
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,542
If you love your wife,
Mr. Schwartz, she's the one.

479
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:37,125
I was just curious.

480
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:39,625
It only happened
one time. That's it.

481
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:42,250
Pete:
You couldn't already
be HIV positive

482
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:45,000
from whatever happened with you
and that guy in the car.

483
00:22:50,667 --> 00:22:53,875
There's nothing wrong
with having sex with men.

484
00:22:53,917 --> 00:22:56,750
Violet:
But there is something wrong
with you living a lie like this.

485
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,667
I'm not lying.

486
00:22:58,709 --> 00:23:01,667
So you know, withholding
the fact you're HIV positive

487
00:23:01,709 --> 00:23:03,792
from your sexual partners could
land you in prison.

488
00:23:03,834 --> 00:23:05,750
Oh, please.
Look, no--

489
00:23:05,792 --> 00:23:06,917
Jacob. Jacob.

490
00:23:10,542 --> 00:23:12,834
Do you enjoy being intimate
with your wife?

491
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:19,500
I enjoy making my wife happy.

492
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,041
That's not really
the same thing.

493
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:34,041
I-I just don't wanna
hurt her, okay?

494
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:36,375
That's it. I want everything
that everyone else wants.

495
00:23:36,417 --> 00:23:39,250
You know, I wanna be happy.

496
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:40,709
Be normal.

497
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,041
You can.

498
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:46,208
You can be happy
and normal, and gay.

499
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,917
But as long
as you're hiding this,

500
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:50,709
how can you really be happy?

501
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:53,125
And until you're
honest with Angela--

502
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:54,500
Jacob:
No, no, no.

503
00:23:54,542 --> 00:23:59,417
Everything that we have,
our marriage, maybe even a baby,

504
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:02,125
I just-- I can't take
that away from her.

505
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:04,458
But she's never really gonna
have that anyway.

506
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:07,500
And if you are honest with her--

507
00:24:07,542 --> 00:24:08,750
how?

508
00:24:15,709 --> 00:24:18,250
God, how can I tell her?

509
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,000
Shouldn't be much longer now.

510
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:26,959
Georgie hates
hospitals.

511
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:29,792
She's not gonna like it here.

512
00:24:31,542 --> 00:24:34,542
Bob, you talk about Georgie
like she's present.

513
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:37,792
She is present. For me.

514
00:24:37,834 --> 00:24:40,125
Physically, yes.
But emotionally--

515
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:43,709
I'm sure it's very difficult
for you.

516
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:50,000
The hardest part

517
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:53,041
is her not being able to talk.

518
00:24:54,959 --> 00:24:56,709
Whenever
anything bad happens,

519
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,542
she always knows
what to say.

520
00:24:58,583 --> 00:25:00,959
You know, what
the silver lining is and...

521
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:05,291
I always wonder
what she'd say about this.

522
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:10,041
She'd be appreciative, I'm sure,
of everything you're doing.

523
00:25:10,083 --> 00:25:12,709
But you understand
that even after the tests

524
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,417
that Dr. Shepherd ran,

525
00:25:14,458 --> 00:25:16,709
it's very unlikely
that Georgie will ever be

526
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:19,542
anything like the woman
you married.

527
00:25:22,667 --> 00:25:25,000
Are you trying to get me
to walk away from her?

528
00:25:25,041 --> 00:25:29,000
I'm trying to get you to think
realistically about your future.

529
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:34,542
She's my best friend.

530
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:37,125
I've never ever...

531
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:38,583
She was my first

532
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:40,041
and she's supposed
to be my last,

533
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:41,542
till death do us part.

534
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,458
I can't just...

535
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,750
She's my best friend.
I-I can't abandon her.

536
00:25:45,792 --> 00:25:49,291
W-We're supposed to die
in each other's arms.

537
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:53,417
If she loved you
half as much as you say,

538
00:25:53,458 --> 00:25:55,667
she wouldn't want this for you.

539
00:25:55,709 --> 00:25:57,208
She'd want you
to be loved by someone

540
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:58,625
who can love you back.

541
00:25:58,667 --> 00:26:00,750
She'd want you happy.

542
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:02,500
I'm not saying
give up on her, Bob.

543
00:26:02,542 --> 00:26:04,000
I'm just saying...

544
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:06,000
Don't give up on yourself.

545
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:11,208
Hi.

546
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,875
Hi.

547
00:26:12,917 --> 00:26:14,000
Nice job with Jacob today.

548
00:26:14,041 --> 00:26:15,041
Thanks.

549
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:17,041
Look what I bought.

550
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:18,875
Ha, ha.
It's a pumpkin,

551
00:26:18,917 --> 00:26:21,041
and it's not plastic or cheap.

552
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:24,041
It's a handmade pumpkin costume.

553
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:27,041
So that Lucas can have
all the happy childhood memories

554
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:29,000
and you can keep your thumbs.

555
00:26:31,709 --> 00:26:32,917
I found Adam.

556
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:34,125
What?

557
00:26:34,166 --> 00:26:35,125
Your brother.

558
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:37,041
I know who Adam is.

559
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:39,500
He lives in--
stop talking.

560
00:26:39,542 --> 00:26:41,667
Why are you so obsessed
with this?

561
00:26:41,709 --> 00:26:43,041
It's my job to care.

562
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:44,291
You're shrinking me?

563
00:26:44,333 --> 00:26:46,291
No, as-- as your wife.

564
00:26:46,333 --> 00:26:48,834
It's my job
to care as your wife.

565
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:51,750
Look, I know this is difficult,
but he's your family.

566
00:26:51,792 --> 00:26:53,041
We're strangers, Violet.

567
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:56,041
We were split up as teenagers,
we went to different houses,

568
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:57,041
I haven't talked to him since.

569
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:59,709
So maybe this is a good time
to reach out.

570
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:07,041
Okay, for a second,
I will be a shrink. All right?

571
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,166
This emotional disconnect
from your past,

572
00:27:09,208 --> 00:27:10,917
from who you were,

573
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:13,542
it's damaging, it's unhealthy.

574
00:27:13,583 --> 00:27:16,041
And it can affect your
relationships down the line.

575
00:27:16,083 --> 00:27:20,959
With a child, with a spouse.

576
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:27,333
I have to go back to work.

577
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,959
Your wife is okay, Mr. Schwartz.

578
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,625
Her cervix dilated

579
00:27:41,667 --> 00:27:44,041
and the placenta
detached, but she's alive.

580
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:47,709
And the baby?

581
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,583
We lost him.

582
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,500
I'm sorry.

583
00:28:05,959 --> 00:28:08,500
You think Jacob's ever gonna
come back here and tell him?

584
00:28:08,542 --> 00:28:09,959
I think he's a little
more concerned

585
00:28:10,041 --> 00:28:11,333
about telling his wife.

586
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:14,792
Then allow me.

587
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:18,041
Mr. Arnold.

588
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:19,834
Do you practice safe sex
with all your tricks?

589
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:22,750
Always.
Charlotte: That's good.

590
00:28:22,792 --> 00:28:25,625
Because the man you got into
the accident with, Jacob Deever,

591
00:28:25,667 --> 00:28:27,875
tested positive for HIV.

592
00:28:27,917 --> 00:28:29,792
We'd be happy to test you,
if you'd like,

593
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:32,208
but if you're telling the truth
about using condoms,

594
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,667
it's not likely to be a problem.

595
00:28:33,709 --> 00:28:34,875
You don't understand.

596
00:28:34,917 --> 00:28:37,667
I said I practice safe sex
with my tricks,

597
00:28:37,709 --> 00:28:40,000
not with the man I love.

598
00:28:47,542 --> 00:28:49,041
Addison:
Hey. How's Georgie?

599
00:28:49,083 --> 00:28:50,583
She's stable. Bob's with her.

600
00:28:50,625 --> 00:28:51,875
Great.

601
00:28:51,917 --> 00:28:53,917
Unfortunately, he's less stable.

602
00:28:53,959 --> 00:28:55,667
How much less stable can he be?

603
00:28:55,709 --> 00:28:57,875
Well, losing Georgie,
for the most part anyway,

604
00:28:57,917 --> 00:28:59,041
and now the baby.

605
00:28:59,083 --> 00:29:00,750
I mean,
these are profound losses.

606
00:29:00,792 --> 00:29:02,875
He's confused and hurting.

607
00:29:02,917 --> 00:29:04,041
But I talked to him
about coming in

608
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:06,834
to start working on his
recovery, so...

609
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:08,667
Good luck.
Right.

610
00:29:08,709 --> 00:29:09,917
Amelia:
Come on, Addie.

611
00:29:09,959 --> 00:29:11,458
They give child molesters
their kids back

612
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,834
if they get enough counseling.

613
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:15,834
Really? You're starting
to sound like Sam.

614
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:19,041
Sam is not all wrong.

615
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:21,917
I have to go check
up on Georgie.

616
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,125
Bob:
...Because you and I,
we never give up.

617
00:29:25,166 --> 00:29:27,125
We stick it out.

618
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:30,375
We never let anything
get in the way of us.

619
00:29:34,083 --> 00:29:35,834
Sweetie,

620
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:38,917
I'm sorry to tell you,

621
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,709
we lost our baby.

622
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:45,959
There was nothing they could do.

623
00:29:47,959 --> 00:29:51,041
But you know what?
Don't worry,

624
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:53,709
because we'll keep trying.

625
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:57,458
We're gonna have
a family one day, Georgie.

626
00:30:07,834 --> 00:30:09,542
Cooper:
Charlotte just hung up on me.

627
00:30:09,583 --> 00:30:12,375
She literally hung up the phone
while I was mid-sentence.

628
00:30:13,709 --> 00:30:15,875
I mean, I'm horny.

629
00:30:15,917 --> 00:30:18,041
And she's mad, and horny.

630
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:20,000
What am I supposed to do?

631
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:23,709
Well, when you're boxed in,
you need to get out of the box.

632
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,291
How do I do that?

633
00:30:27,083 --> 00:30:29,041
Do something you've
never done before.

634
00:30:29,083 --> 00:30:30,333
Like what?

635
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:31,542
I don't know, Coop.

636
00:30:31,583 --> 00:30:33,041
I got stuff on my mind.

637
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:35,125
Can you just figure
it out for yourself?

638
00:30:36,542 --> 00:30:38,125
Finish the e-mail
to Pete's brother?

639
00:30:38,166 --> 00:30:39,500
Yeah. I don't know what to do.

640
00:30:39,542 --> 00:30:40,917
Do I send it? Do I erase it?

641
00:30:40,959 --> 00:30:43,834
I think you need to figure
that out for yourself.

642
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:45,625
I just think, with Adam,
we could have a family.

643
00:30:45,667 --> 00:30:47,125
You know? A real family.

644
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:48,375
Pete could have a brother,

645
00:30:48,417 --> 00:30:51,709
I could learn
more about who Pete is and...

646
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,041
Okay, that was about me,
and I know this isn't about me--

647
00:30:54,083 --> 00:30:55,041
well, it's a bit about me.

648
00:30:55,083 --> 00:30:57,208
Violet, uh--
I mean, he might get mad.

649
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:59,041
Okay, he will get really mad.

650
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:01,625
And what if he and Adam
don't like each other as adults?

651
00:31:01,667 --> 00:31:04,041
Or what if Adam doesn't like
kids and he's not nice to Lucas?

652
00:31:04,083 --> 00:31:06,208
What if he's mean to Lucas?
I'm staying silent.

653
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:08,417
But a real family, that's worth
fighting for. Right?

654
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:10,542
And I think Pete's--
I think he wants to fix this.

655
00:31:10,583 --> 00:31:12,583
It's the right thing to do.
I know it is.

656
00:31:12,625 --> 00:31:14,000
It's the right thing to do.

657
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:20,000
Mm-- mm-mm. Mm.

658
00:31:20,041 --> 00:31:21,125
What did you do?

659
00:31:21,166 --> 00:31:22,625
Pressed send.

660
00:31:22,667 --> 00:31:24,542
Done. Ship sailed.

661
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:26,208
You're mad?

662
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,041
Do you know what this is gonna
do to my marriage?

663
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:30,792
To Pete? Did--?
Have you lost your mind?

664
00:31:30,834 --> 00:31:32,000
I didn't send it.

665
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:36,041
Ow. I was just trying to help
you make up your mind.

666
00:31:37,542 --> 00:31:39,000
I know. I'm just--

667
00:31:40,417 --> 00:31:42,667
I'm frustrated.

668
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,250
Why won't Pete talk to me?

669
00:31:49,709 --> 00:31:51,208
Angela:
So is everything okay?

670
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:53,792
Please tell me it's not
my bladder again.

671
00:31:53,834 --> 00:31:55,709
No.

672
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:58,875
I didn't call you in to talk
about getting pregnant.

673
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:11,291
Jacob:
Angela, I do love you.

674
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:13,583
I've always loved you.

675
00:32:14,792 --> 00:32:16,458
I love what we have together.

676
00:32:22,291 --> 00:32:26,667
But what Evan
and I share is, um...

677
00:32:26,709 --> 00:32:29,000
It's-- it's different.

678
00:32:31,125 --> 00:32:32,875
I don't expect you
to understand that--

679
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:33,917
Jacob, I know.

680
00:32:35,709 --> 00:32:37,709
I've always known.

681
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:41,959
Not about Evan,
but about who you really are.

682
00:32:43,709 --> 00:32:46,792
You don't spend 20 years
with someone and not know.

683
00:32:52,375 --> 00:32:55,000
Okay, you have to know
I didn't mean to hurt you.

684
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:57,125
I know I should be enraged.

685
00:32:57,166 --> 00:33:01,041
I know I should be screaming,

686
00:33:01,083 --> 00:33:02,667
but all I can think about

687
00:33:02,709 --> 00:33:06,250
is how hard this must
have been for you.

688
00:33:07,458 --> 00:33:12,375
All the pretending.
Living two lives.

689
00:33:12,417 --> 00:33:15,667
Not being yourself.

690
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:23,041
Ha, ha. God, I'm so healthy.

691
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:24,750
I was gonna say.

692
00:33:24,792 --> 00:33:26,834
Listen, I wasn't completely
pretending, okay?

693
00:33:26,875 --> 00:33:28,792
My feelings for you are real.

694
00:33:28,834 --> 00:33:30,709
I just didn't know.

695
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:35,583
When we first met,
I didn't know who I was, okay?

696
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:40,125
Or maybe I did
and I just didn't wanna know.

697
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,583
I just didn't wanna know.

698
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:50,000
But now you know,
and that's good.

699
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:53,041
That's a good thing.

700
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,250
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

701
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:04,875
We will always be friends.

702
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:08,917
It's okay. I'll be okay.

703
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:14,583
Take care of him.

704
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:18,917
I will. Thank you.

705
00:34:22,917 --> 00:34:25,041
I'm going to, um...

706
00:34:26,291 --> 00:34:28,000
I'm going to go.

707
00:34:30,542 --> 00:34:32,750
There's something else
you need to tell her, Jacob.

708
00:34:46,917 --> 00:34:48,917
Evan and I...

709
00:34:50,417 --> 00:34:53,542
We are both HIV positive.

710
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:56,041
Wh--?

711
00:34:58,375 --> 00:35:01,041
Pete:
You're negative, Angela.

712
00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:03,041
We'll test you again
in six months.

713
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:10,917
Angela, please.

714
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:27,333
Hey.

715
00:35:28,917 --> 00:35:31,083
What are you doing
at your house?

716
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:35,000
Well, I wasn't having
much luck at your house.

717
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,208
You wanna try again?

718
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:43,166
Do you?

719
00:35:47,542 --> 00:35:50,083
I called the police on Bob.

720
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:53,083
I turned him
in for molesting his wife.

721
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:59,542
All right. Give me a sec.
I'll be right over.

722
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:01,083
Wait, you're not mad?

723
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:03,291
You think I'm right.

724
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:05,083
No.

725
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:07,750
I'm furious. You were wrong.

726
00:36:07,792 --> 00:36:11,583
That man needed counseling.
He needed...

727
00:36:12,667 --> 00:36:14,291
I was right and you were wrong.

728
00:36:14,333 --> 00:36:18,083
But that was at work.

729
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:20,709
We're at home now.

730
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:24,000
I'm gonna practice
what I preach, and, uh...

731
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:27,041
I'll yell at you tomorrow.

732
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:29,625
So tomorrow we'll fight?

733
00:36:32,083 --> 00:36:34,000
But tonight--
sex for me.

734
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,667
Sex for you.

735
00:36:39,709 --> 00:36:42,041
Okay. I only got a half an hour

736
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:44,041
because I'm supposed
to meet Cooper for drinks.

737
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:47,667
Then we'd
better make it count.

738
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,208
Hold that pose.
I'll be right over.

739
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,583
Sex for me.

740
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:01,333
Man:
I just need to see a doctor.

741
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:03,041
You need to take it easy.

742
00:37:03,083 --> 00:37:04,041
Man:
Are you a real doctor?

743
00:37:04,083 --> 00:37:05,083
I told you to pipe down.

744
00:37:05,125 --> 00:37:06,583
Now sit down and wait your turn.

745
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:08,792
Someone will be
with you in a minute.

746
00:37:08,834 --> 00:37:09,792
Man:
Pipe down.

747
00:37:09,834 --> 00:37:11,041
Lively in here tonight, huh?

748
00:37:11,083 --> 00:37:12,667
Halloween brings
out the crazies.

749
00:37:12,709 --> 00:37:13,709
Mm.

750
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:14,792
What's that?

751
00:37:14,834 --> 00:37:17,500
Oh, this?

752
00:37:17,542 --> 00:37:20,041
Uh, this is a miniature
Alabama Lane cake

753
00:37:20,083 --> 00:37:22,041
that was made just for you.

754
00:37:22,083 --> 00:37:24,709
Is that how we make up now?

755
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,041
With sweets?

756
00:37:26,083 --> 00:37:27,458
No, no. This is a bribe.

757
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,875
This is how we make up:

758
00:37:29,917 --> 00:37:34,041
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm so, so, so sorry.

759
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:36,458
There will be no more
baby talk. No pressure.

760
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,291
I mean, I don't even
wanna see a baby.

761
00:37:38,333 --> 00:37:40,500
Ew. Babies. Mm.

762
00:37:40,542 --> 00:37:44,500
I just
want to see you happy.

763
00:37:44,542 --> 00:37:46,750
You're very cute
when you're lying.

764
00:37:48,542 --> 00:37:53,250
And maybe we can practice
not making a baby.

765
00:37:53,291 --> 00:37:55,291
I plan on that.

766
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:57,250
Okay.

767
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:05,709
Pete:
One, two, three. Whoo!

768
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,208
Violet:
Isn't this fun?

769
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:08,625
Actually, it is.

770
00:38:08,667 --> 00:38:10,291
I can see the merits
of your family tradition.

771
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:12,125
I thought Halloween
wasn't your thing.

772
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:15,291
But it's your thing,
so now it's our thing.

773
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:17,041
Hey, okay, Lucas.
Go ahead.

774
00:38:17,083 --> 00:38:19,041
Go ahead, Lucas.
Go with Anna. Go with Anna.

775
00:38:19,083 --> 00:38:21,083
There you go.

776
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:28,041
Okay, um...

777
00:38:28,083 --> 00:38:31,041
I'm going crazy.
I'm not enjoying this.

778
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:32,125
I know I should be,
but I'm not.

779
00:38:32,166 --> 00:38:35,250
I, um...

780
00:38:35,291 --> 00:38:37,041
I almost sent an e-mail today
to your brother.

781
00:38:37,083 --> 00:38:38,667
Violet--

782
00:38:38,709 --> 00:38:40,041
you have to give me
something.

783
00:38:40,083 --> 00:38:43,041
I mean, I need to feel
like I know you.

784
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:45,000
I need to feel
like you want me to know you.

785
00:38:46,417 --> 00:38:49,583
Please. I mean, obviously
your mom did something

786
00:38:49,625 --> 00:38:52,041
to land herself in prison,
but your brother--

787
00:38:52,083 --> 00:38:54,583
what is it about your family
that makes you so angry?

788
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:56,041
I'm gonna tell the story once

789
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:58,375
and I'm never gonna
tell it again. Okay?

790
00:39:02,834 --> 00:39:06,000
My mother...

791
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:08,917
She liked to have a good time.
She was a party all by herself.

792
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:10,709
And my brother--

793
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:14,834
Adam made excuses for her
because he thought she--

794
00:39:14,875 --> 00:39:17,208
I was the one that cleaned
the vomit off the floor.

795
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,041
I was the one that woke
her up twice a night

796
00:39:19,083 --> 00:39:20,417
to make sure
she was still breathing.

797
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:24,041
She was a drunk.
And she was...

798
00:39:24,083 --> 00:39:26,041
Beautiful,

799
00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:28,250
so there were men.

800
00:39:28,291 --> 00:39:29,667
Lots of men.

801
00:39:29,709 --> 00:39:31,667
And I don't even know

802
00:39:33,834 --> 00:39:36,417
who my father is.

803
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:38,625
Anyway, finally,
there was Henry.

804
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:41,041
I have no idea what
he saw in her,

805
00:39:41,083 --> 00:39:45,250
but he was the first man I ever
met who didn't ignore me.

806
00:39:45,291 --> 00:39:48,625
I was 13 and he was the first
good man I ever knew.

807
00:39:48,667 --> 00:39:51,000
Which, now I think--

808
00:39:52,083 --> 00:39:53,500
h-he took us to ball games,

809
00:39:53,542 --> 00:39:56,542
helped me with my homework,
told me I could be a doctor.

810
00:39:57,667 --> 00:40:00,792
And things were steady,
things were good.

811
00:40:00,834 --> 00:40:02,667
But even though Henry
was living with us,

812
00:40:02,709 --> 00:40:05,041
even though he wanted
to marry her,

813
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:08,041
there were a lot of men again.

814
00:40:08,083 --> 00:40:10,083
One morning she came
in the kitchen,

815
00:40:10,125 --> 00:40:11,917
she'd been out all night,

816
00:40:11,959 --> 00:40:13,500
and he was there
packing to leave,

817
00:40:13,542 --> 00:40:15,250
because I guess he'd had it,

818
00:40:15,291 --> 00:40:16,625
and she starts screaming.

819
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:18,041
I didn't know what was
happening.

820
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:20,041
And then they're in the kitchen,
she's screaming

821
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:23,375
and then she's hitting him,
he's defending himself,

822
00:40:23,417 --> 00:40:26,417
and then she gets
a knife and then...

823
00:40:26,458 --> 00:40:29,000
And then he was dead, and...

824
00:40:32,959 --> 00:40:34,542
He was a good guy.

825
00:40:37,458 --> 00:40:40,083
Then I called the cops on her.

826
00:40:40,125 --> 00:40:44,542
And Adam, he lied for her.
He testified for her.

827
00:40:44,583 --> 00:40:46,542
That's why she only got
manslaughter.

828
00:40:48,375 --> 00:40:50,542
You think there's good
in everyone, Violet.

829
00:40:50,583 --> 00:40:52,458
It's not true.

830
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,667
There's no good there.

831
00:40:55,709 --> 00:41:01,417
My family is garbage
and I won't go back.

832
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:02,667
Okay?

833
00:41:02,709 --> 00:41:04,709
Okay.

834
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:07,000
Anna: There we go.
Violet: Hi, bud.

835
00:41:08,083 --> 00:41:09,291
Hi.

836
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:10,792
Pete:
Are we done?

837
00:41:10,834 --> 00:41:12,291
Because I have a shift in the er

838
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:15,333
and I wanna go start work early.

839
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,000
Yeah, we're done.
Pete: Okay.

840
00:41:19,083 --> 00:41:20,583
Yeah.
