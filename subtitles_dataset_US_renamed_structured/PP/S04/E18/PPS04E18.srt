Well, what you wrote
about Violet--

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,041
was accurate

12
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:40,041
and right now,
beside the point.

13
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:43,875
I can think of better things
to do than talk about her,

14
00:00:43,917 --> 00:00:46,959
but if you can't--
oh, no, no, no.
Let's--let's start over.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,542
Good morning.

00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:50,458

Yeah. I got paged
on an incoming arrhythmia.

21
00:01:00,542 --> 00:01:02,041
How's Addison doing?

22
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:03,834
Well, she's fine, I guess.

23
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:05,417
In Seattle,
delivering a baby.

24
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:07,917
Is everything okay?

25
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:12,667
She, uh,
she wants her own baby.

26
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:16,041
And I'm not ready,
but, uh...
76-year-old female,
acute shortness of...

27
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:18,458
Adam,
what are you doing here?

28
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,583
She's gotten worse.
Didn't know what else to do.
Bradycardic at 40
with a pressure of 90.

29
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:23,583
- Please, Pete.
- Respiratory rate?

30
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:26,041
24 and labored.
Put her in bay one.
Is that--

31
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:28,083
my mother.

32
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:35,041
Well, under the circumstances,
your anger is justifiable.

33
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:37,542
Under the circumstances,
homicide is justifiable.

34
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:41,500
Oh, if I have to hear "she's
my b.F.F." One more time...

35
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:43,083
Wait. I'm sorry. Do--

36
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:46,750
have you ever done one of those
city college lecture things?

37
00:01:46,792 --> 00:01:49,208
Because you look
really familiar.
No. No, that wasn't me.

38
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,083
So let's--let's, uh,
let's stay on point here.

39
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:53,959
I-I think the important thing

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,041
is to understand why your
daughters made this decision

41
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,542
and to figure out
how we can move forward.

42
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:00,959
I've racked my brain,
and I just don't know.

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Lisa and I have always been
so close. What did I do wrong?

44
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,667
Well, this isn't necessarily
about you.

45
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,667
I'm a single mother
with three kids, Dr. Wallace.

46
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:11,250
When something goes wrong,
it's always about me.

47
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:13,875
Maybe the girls were
trying to redefine their lives

48
00:02:13,917 --> 00:02:16,041
in a way that is
more meaningful to them.

49
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:18,583
Maybe compensating for low
self-esteem or looking for

50
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:21,041
what they perceive
as unconditional love.

51
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:24,041
Oh, give me a break. What does
Casey have to be upset about?

52
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:26,083
And that's what we need
to explore.

53
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:29,041
Which is also why we need
to speak to your daughters.

54
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,041
We're not pathetic,
knocked-up teenagers.

55
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:33,291
We made a choice.
It's a pact.

56
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,417
Explain that to us.

57
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:38,291
Why did you decide
to get pregnant... together?
Why should I worry

58
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:41,041
about good grades
and getting into college

59
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:43,917
when all I want
is to be a mom anyway?

60
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:45,333
Plus, instant status.

61
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:48,709
Babies love you no matter what.
That's awesome.

62
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,750
Are you not feeling loved
at home now, Lisa?
Well, yeah.

63
00:02:51,792 --> 00:02:54,291
My mom's a trooper.
It's just...

64
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:57,041
There's a lot going on
around the house,

65
00:02:57,083 --> 00:03:00,000
so she can't give each one
of us attention, you know?
I felt loved

66
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:02,583
until my mother tried
to make me have an abortion.

67
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,625
What you might think
is a lack of love

68
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:07,333
could be your mother
trying to protect you.

69
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:10,125
She's trying to protect herself.
She doesn't care about me.

70
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:14,250
That's why
we need each other.

71
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,041
She has a.V. Dissociation.

72
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,750
Pete, is she--
atropine.

73
00:03:17,792 --> 00:03:19,250
.6.
I can't breathe.

74
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,875
She's in third-degree
heart block.
What does that mean?

75
00:03:21,917 --> 00:03:24,041
I need to float a temporary
pacemaker, stabilize her rhythm.
What the hell is going on?

76
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:26,458
If you want to stay, you're
gonna have to stop talking.
I can handle this.

77
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,667
Where's the damn catheter?
All right,
heart rate's dropping.

78
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,959
Pete, please, look at me.
Do something.

79
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,458
Get out! If you want her
to live, get the hell out!

80
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,083
So the Belarus competition,

81
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,083
I won--
first American ever.

82
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:53,041
What? That's amazing.
What did you play?
Rachmaninoff's third.

83
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:56,041
Really? That's like
the hardest concerto there is.

84
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:58,041
Not like,
it is the hardest.

85
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,834
The technical aspects
are impossible

86
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,709
for most musicians to master.

87
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,667
Child or adult.
You must be very proud
of your grandson.

88
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:06,875
No one plays it as well
as Patrick.

89
00:04:06,917 --> 00:04:08,917
Every bit of his hard work
and discipline shows.

90
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,792
Is the numbness constant
or does it come and go?

91
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:14,000
It comes and goes.

92
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,208
Grab my fingers
and squeeze...

93
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,792
Hard as you can.

94
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:23,041
Okay. Now hands out,
palms up.

95
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,875
Close your eyes.

96
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:31,041
Is something wrong?
Well, I think it would be
worth getting an m.R.I.,

97
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:34,041
and our neurosurgeon
should take a look.

98
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,667
Do you know how many
conversations we've had

99
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,750
about protection?
I bought her condoms.

100
00:04:38,792 --> 00:04:40,625
I put her
on birth control pills.

101
00:04:40,667 --> 00:04:42,625
I suppose I should've just
taped her damn legs shut,

102
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:45,250
but I didn't--
like that would've worked.

103
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,709
O-okay, okay, let's calm down.
Easy for you to say. You're not
the one who's going to be

104
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,875
contending with three kids
and a grandchild.
We're the ones
who will sacrifice.

105
00:04:50,917 --> 00:04:52,917
Jamie, what are you thinking?

106
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,500
She's probably glad her mom's
not here to yell at her.

107
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:58,000
My mom said she had to
pick up my brother

108
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,667
and drop him off at home.
She said she'd be back.
Can I just say something?

109
00:05:00,709 --> 00:05:02,917
We've been here all morning.
If we're here all afternoon,

110
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:05,917
we're gonna miss a lot more
than school.
I don't care if we're here
all day every day

111
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:09,041
for the rest of the year.
We have to sort this out.

112
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,709
You wrote this book.

113
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,041
I knew I recognized you.

114
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,166
I bought this last week
and I'm halfway through it,

115
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,792
but... she's not the right
therapist for our daughters.

116
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:21,750
You guys, she has this totally
nasty scar down her stomach.

117
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:24,500
Can we try to focus?
Ah, no laying out
for you, eh?

118
00:05:24,542 --> 00:05:27,291
There are things in this book
that I promise you

119
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:30,000
you will not like.
Like what?

120
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:33,000
I don't want to embarrass her,
but--
this is not the place
for this discussion.

121
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:36,542
Could we see
the scar?
Jamie, let's go.
We're done with this.

122
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,083
Patrick's parents died
in a car accident when he was 5,

123
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,500
and Dennis has raised him
on his own ever since.

124
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:50,709
He was apparently a renowned
conductor until his son died.

125
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,041
Then he took Patrick in,
taught him the piano,

126
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:55,083
and now this kid's a prodigy.

127
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,041
Mm. Classical music
puts me to sleep.

128
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,333
Are you really
that uncultured?

129
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,250
This coming from the guy
who rushes home

130
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,583
to watch outtakes
of "American bake-off"?

131
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:06,041
Okay.

132
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,875
Damn it.

133
00:06:08,917 --> 00:06:10,250
What? What is it?

134
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:13,875
It's called
a pilocytic astrocytoma.

135
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:16,458
It's in the part of the brain
that controls hand function.

136
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,041
Am I gonna die?
You'll have to have surgery.

137
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,250
You'll have to
cut into his brain?

138
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,250
It's the best course
of action.

139
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:25,250
The safest and simplest route

140
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:28,041
would be right through
the center of the motor strip.

141
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,041
But if we go through that area,
the likelihood

142
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:32,625
is that we would destroy
all function in his right hand.

143
00:06:32,667 --> 00:06:36,000
I... I won't be able
to play music anymore?

144
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:38,291
No.

145
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:41,083
Are there
any other options?

146
00:06:42,834 --> 00:06:45,041
I can do
an awake craniotomy.

147
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:48,250
Awake?
During brain surgery?

148
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,917
Because you'd be conscious
and able to talk to me,

149
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:53,291
I could monitor your hand
function much more closely

150
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:56,458
and try to avoid damaging
any of the corresponding nerves.

151
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,458
Would it hurt?
There are no pain sensors
on the brain.

152
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,875
Your scalp would be numb,
so you would hear the drill,

153
00:07:01,917 --> 00:07:03,625
you would feel pressure
from the vibration,

154
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:06,917
but it wouldn't hurt,
however, because I would be

155
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,917
taking a longer
and more indirect route,

156
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:11,917
there is a possibility
of inflicting more damage.
What kind of damage?

157
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,291
Patrick might end up

158
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:16,041
with some degree of paralysis
in his right leg.

159
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:20,041
But... but I'll
still be able to play.

160
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,667
Uh, I don't know
if this is the right--

161
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:25,041
please, grandpa.
Let her do it.

162
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:29,083
I don't need legs,
but I need the piano.

163
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:35,542
What do you think?
The pacemaker will
buy us time.

164
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:38,041
I can't figure out why
her rhythms deteriorated.
How is she?

165
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,250
Uh, she's stable for now.
What is she doing
out of jail?

166
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:43,041
Well, after you wouldn't sign
her compassionate release,

167
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,041
mom's health got worse.

168
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,542
She developed
congestive heart failure.

169
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,959
And the prison doctors,
they couldn't handle it,

170
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,041
so... last week, they, uh,
they let her out.

171
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,750
Anyway, this morning,
she, uh,

172
00:07:52,792 --> 00:07:55,041
she was having a hard time
catching her breath,

173
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,125
so I called 9-1-1.
All right, did anything
bring this on?

174
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,125
Has she been smoking?
Just a few a day.

175
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,041
How about drugs?
Anything new?

176
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,875
Answer the question.

177
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:06,458
Look, I tried finding another
doctor to sign that release.

178
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,041
But you were right, Pete.

179
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:10,417
Her heart symptoms,
they weren't bad enough.

180
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:13,333
She just wasn't sick enough.
So she told you
to make her sick enough.

181
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,959
She said she didn't care how,
that she'd do anything.

182
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,041
So I did some research,
and I, uh...

183
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:21,041
I bribed a guard who, uh,
slipped her these pills.

184
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,709
All right, what--
what kind of pills?

185
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,959
What were you thinking?
She begged me.
I had to get her out.

186
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,917
What kind of pills?
Digoxin.

187
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:32,625
What is it? What's the matter?
Don't you understand?
You poisoned her.

188
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:36,041
I need 250 milligrams
of digiverse. Now.

189
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,917
Violet, I think
it might be better

190
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:44,166
if you step aside
on this one.

191
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,750
Sheldon, some people who read
my book will be patients.

192
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:48,792
I anticipated that.
I can work with that.

193
00:08:48,834 --> 00:08:51,333
It doesn't take away
from the fact

194
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,333
that I can help these girls.
I think it does.

195
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:56,041
As therapists, we have to be
blank slates, sounding boards.

196
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,625
There's a reason
we're judicious

197
00:08:57,667 --> 00:08:59,625
about sharing our personal lives
with patients.

198
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:02,125
It distracts them.
They waste time focusing on us

199
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:05,041
instead of dedicating their
energy on their own problems.

200
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,458
You know that
that session was tainted.

201
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,041
There was no taint there.

202
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:11,375
There--there was titillation,
and that will fade.

203
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:13,375
Those girls
don't want to be here,

204
00:09:13,417 --> 00:09:15,625
which means getting through
to them is an uphill battle.

205
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:17,041
And their mothers--
I just...

206
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:20,041
There's a lot of work
that needs to be done

207
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:21,667
in repairing
those relationships.

208
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:23,667
Which I can do,
because last time I checked,

209
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:25,583
only one of us
is actually a mother

210
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,709
or a former 16-year-old girl.

211
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,083
With all due respect,

212
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,458
having a vagina does not give
you a degree in psychiatry,

213
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,041
and whether you might
believe it or not,

214
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,917
your book is a problem.

215
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:39,750
I can handle it, Sheldon.

216
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,417
You know, you might find this
hard to believe,

217
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,417
but I was trying to help her.
She almost died.

218
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,125
I told him to do it.

219
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:54,041
I had no choice
because you wouldn't help me.

220
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,959
You are not
my responsibility.

221
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,458
Yes, she is. Parents take care
of their children,

222
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,041
then children step up
for their parents.

223
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,291
I mean, isn't that what
you're gonna do teach Lucas?
You leave my son out of this.

224
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,291
Boys, please.
She did not take care of us.

225
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:08,250
I was the one who made sure we
had something to eat every day.

226
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,417
I was the one
who put us to bed

227
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:13,333
on the nights when she was
drinking, which was every night.

228
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:17,208
Don't talk about me that way.
I'm still your mother.
Yeah, you were there
at the birth,

229
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,208
I'll give you that,
but that's it.

230
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:23,333
How did you get to be
so cold, Pete?
You made me that way.

231
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,583
You look like the cat
who got the cream.

232
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,583
I am most definitely
that cat.

233
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,542
Who's the lucky girl?

234
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,041
Marla thompkins.

235
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:42,500
The reviewer who trashed
Violet's book? You're kidding.

236
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:45,041
How'd that happen?
Oh, I met her
at Violet's book party,

237
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,500
and then she called.

238
00:10:46,542 --> 00:10:48,792
I knew I should've said no
after what she did to Violet--

239
00:10:48,834 --> 00:10:51,291
only matters what she's doing to
you, and from the looks of it,

240
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,792
she is doing it well.
I say go for it.

241
00:10:53,834 --> 00:10:56,792
- Go for what?
- Marla thompkins.

242
00:10:56,834 --> 00:10:59,625
Seriously?
Was I speaking in tongues?

243
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:03,125
You'd really do that to Violet?
Yes, I'm late for something.

244
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,041
Who put a bug
up your ass?

245
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,583
That'd be me.

246
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,917
I gave his patient
an opinion he didn't like.

247
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,041
My patient is a piano virtuoso.
He also has a brain tumor.

248
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:15,041
The safest way
to remove the tumor

249
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:18,041
may mean that he never plays
the piano again.
If I take
a more radical approach,

250
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,166
I'll compromise his leg
but I'll spare his hand.

251
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,333
He could have a stroke.

252
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:25,083
You could knock out
his hearing or his vision.
This is the surgery
that Patrick wants.

253
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,083
He's 14 years old.
He's nowhere near old enough

254
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,542
to understand the implications
of a decision this big.

255
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:32,583
What's the right age to choose
between an arm and a leg?

256
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,834
Look,
some things you just know.

257
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:38,041
I knew at age 6
I was gonna be a surgeon.
And when I was a little kid,
I was obsessed with the piano

258
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,667
and thought maybe I wanted
to be a musician.
I never knew you played.

259
00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:42,166
'Cause my interests changed.

260
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,166
What was important to me then
is not important to me now.

261
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,166
And maybe someday,
Patrick's gonna want

262
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:49,166
to walk down the aisle
or chase after his kids.
Look, this kid has a gift.

263
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,709
Who are we
to take it away from him?

264
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,583
Believe it or not,
my day got worse.

265
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:02,458
Yes, actually,
I'm meeting someone--
so Pete is all freaked out

266
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,875
because they brought
his mother into the E.R.,

267
00:12:04,917 --> 00:12:07,250
and she's supposed to be
in prison, but his brother--

268
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:10,083
his brother, Adam--got her out.
But not in any normal way.

269
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,041
No, no, not through
a parole hearing

270
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,166
or time off for good behavior.
No, he poisons her.

271
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,041
He poisons her.

272
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:19,041
Now granted that is a course
of action I've been considering

273
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,792
with my own mother for a number
of years now, but I've managed

274
00:12:21,834 --> 00:12:24,041
to keep that particular genie
in the bottle.

275
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,000
So Frances' heart
is now damaged,

276
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:29,417
and Adam is blaming Pete,
and Pete is blaming Adam--
sorry I'm late.

277
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:32,041
Oh.
 We didn't the chance to meet the other night

278
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,792
at your party.
Marla thompkins.

279
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:37,041
Yeah,
i-i-i know who you are.

280
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,625
Are you two dating?

281
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:42,041
Well, you know...
Labels can be so confining.

282
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,583
We're dating.

283
00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:47,667
Patrick and I
have discussed it.

284
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:50,667
We will go
with the safer surgery.
Well, that's a good call.

285
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:54,875
We didn't discuss it. Grandpa
just told me what he wanted.

286
00:12:54,917 --> 00:12:56,709
What? It's the truth.

287
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,250
You are a child.

288
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:01,000
It's my brain.
Patrick, we can't go ahead
with a craniotomy

289
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,333
without
your grandfather's consent.

290
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,959
But if Patrick does not want
the other surgery,

291
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,417
we can't force him
to do that, either.
I don't understand.

292
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,834
If it becomes a matter
for the courts,

293
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,875
they'll probably go
with what you decide,

294
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:14,250
but that could take weeks.
We don't have weeks. We need
to do the surgery immediately.

295
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:17,083
Or Patrick will die.
We'll do the safer surgery.

296
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:19,083
But that's not
what I want.

297
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,583
The decision's been made.
No, it's not.

298
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:24,041
Either you let me do
the awake craniotomy,

299
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:27,000
or you let me die.

300
00:13:41,542 --> 00:13:43,917
Hey, Patrick.

301
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:45,792
Hey.

302
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,917
You never get nervous
when you're onstage?

303
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,041
Once I start playing,
I'm just in it.

304
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:56,125
I guess that's a good thing
when you're performing.

305
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:59,208
But, you know, that focus on
what's right in front of you,

306
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,625
it can keep you
from seeing everything else.

307
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:03,208
This surgery that you want,

308
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:06,291
you could spend the rest
of your life in a wheelchair.

309
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:09,291
I don't care.
You don't care now,
but I don't think

310
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,417
you really understand
the decision you're making.

311
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,375
There's only a handful
of people in the world

312
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:15,375
who can do what I do.

313
00:14:15,417 --> 00:14:17,375
When I play,
every part of me--

314
00:14:17,417 --> 00:14:19,417
my hands,
my brain, my soul--

315
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,375
it all engages
in this perfect synchronicity.

316
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:25,250
It's almost like
I'm watching myself

317
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:27,208
rather than actually
doing it.

318
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,208
I can't really describe it,
but--

319
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,208
being a musician,
that feeling,

320
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,583
I know it's the most important
thing to you now,

321
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,583
but you're just a kid.

322
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,250
You can't close yourself off
to the idea that other things

323
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,250
could become equally
if not more important.

324
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:44,041
I think if you talk to
your grandfather about this...

325
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,667
He loves you, Patrick.

326
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:48,041
He loves the way I play.
I don't think music

327
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:50,166
is as important to him
as your relationship.

328
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,417
Music is my relationship
with my grandfather.

329
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:55,041
All these people showed up
at the house

330
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,083
the night
my parents were killed.

331
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,041
I didn't know
what they were doing there,

332
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,875
but everyone kept asking me

333
00:15:00,917 --> 00:15:04,291
if I wanted ice cream
or pizza or a movie.

334
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,291
I thought it was a party.

335
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:10,041
Then I saw my grandfather,
and he looked so sad.

336
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,875
I tried to hug him,

337
00:15:11,917 --> 00:15:15,291
and he didn't know
what to do.

338
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:18,375
He never really
looked at me after that

339
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,375
until he taught me
to play piano.

340
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:22,875
That's how we started
to speak to each other.

341
00:15:22,917 --> 00:15:24,875
You can learn other ways
to communicate.

342
00:15:24,917 --> 00:15:27,458
He can't.

343
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,834
Frances.

344
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:02,875
I'm--I'm Violet Turner.
I'm Pete's wife.

345
00:16:02,917 --> 00:16:04,250
Who'd have thought--

346
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,667
Pete's a doctor
married to a doctor?

347
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:08,667
And a pretty one, too.

348
00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:12,375
And your boy Lucas, is he
as smart as the two of you?

349
00:16:12,417 --> 00:16:16,041
Smarter.
He has Pete's smile.

350
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,083
Well, I never saw
much of that smile.

351
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:23,583
Pete never talks about
his father.

352
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:27,125
Well, that's because
he never knew him.
You two weren't together
that long?

353
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:30,041
Long enough
to have a baby...

354
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:32,792
A few laughs.

355
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:38,625
Well...
Do you need anything?

356
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:41,041
Can I get you anything?

357
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,542
Can you get Pete
to talk to me?

358
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:46,375
Well, I think
that's up to Pete.

359
00:16:46,417 --> 00:16:48,333
I'm probably
asking for too much.

360
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:51,041
I mean, he's been here.

361
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,000
He's just cold.

362
00:16:54,667 --> 00:16:56,834
I can't erase what I did.

363
00:16:56,875 --> 00:17:00,000
I'll be judged for that.

364
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:03,041
But I want Pete to forgive me.

365
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:07,041
I need that before I...

366
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:10,208
You don't owe me
one damn thing.

367
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,834
But please,
can you help me?

368
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:20,041
Why didn't you tell me
you played piano?

369
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,041
It didn't seem important.

370
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:25,625
Sounds like
you used to love it.
I used to love
to eat paste, too.

371
00:17:25,667 --> 00:17:28,625
Why'd you give it up?
The piano or the paste?

372
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:30,250
Did you get bored?
No.

373
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,667
Were you just not any good?
Actually, I was quite good.

374
00:17:32,709 --> 00:17:35,417
My dad taught me. You know, my
mom, she's not at all musical.

375
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:38,041
The woman can't even whistle.
So it was something special

376
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,417
that me and my dad shared,
just the two of us.

377
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,041
Then why'd you quit?

378
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:45,041
Uh...

379
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:47,041
I told you about my brother.

380
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,458
The one who died
before you were born--Andy.

381
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,041
So when I was, like, 15,

382
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,417
I found a picture
tucked into some sheet music,

383
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,041
um, of Andy.

384
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,041
And he couldn't have been
more than 4 or 5,

385
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,041
and he was sitting
on my dad's lap,

386
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,625
and my dad was holding
his hands on the keys.

387
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:04,625
And so your dad taught
Andy to play, too.

388
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:06,208
Doesn't mean
it wasn't special.

389
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,834
Every time I practiced,
I wondered if my dad

390
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,625
was in the other room

391
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:14,875
pretending
it was Andy playing....

392
00:18:14,917 --> 00:18:17,041
So I quit.

393
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,709
Sorry, Coop.

394
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,250
Don't be.
It was a long time ago.

395
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:23,834
You wanted to know,
and I told you.

396
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,542
You know, um...

397
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:46,250
Every Sunday
when I was growing up,

398
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,875
my parents would take me
to this Chinese restaurant,

399
00:18:48,917 --> 00:18:51,917
and, um... I j--i hated it.

400
00:18:51,959 --> 00:18:53,917
It was
all the way across town,

401
00:18:53,959 --> 00:18:57,000
and we would drive in silence
to get to this meal

402
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:59,041
where nobody
basically said a word.

403
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,500
So, um, the last time
I was home,

404
00:19:01,542 --> 00:19:03,500
my parents wanted to go
to that restaurant,

405
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,458
and I thought, you know,
I'm a grown-up.

406
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,458
I mean, how bad can it be?

407
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,375
Well, two bites
into this egg roll,

408
00:19:09,417 --> 00:19:11,875
I was complaining about work,

409
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:14,875
and my mother cut me off
with a smile, and she said,

410
00:19:14,917 --> 00:19:18,166
"why didn't you become a lawyer
like your cousin Trudy?"

411
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,375
And the way she said it,

412
00:19:20,417 --> 00:19:23,417
Pete, I swear, I...

413
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:26,417
I couldn't even finish eating.
I just walked out the door.

414
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,625
I thought Trudy was a teacher.
She is.

415
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,041
She practiced law for two years,
and then she quit,

416
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,625
which is a fact my mother
is well-aware of.

417
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:35,625
Okay,
I get it Violet.

418
00:19:35,667 --> 00:19:37,709
- Nobody pushes our buttons like family.
- And when they do,

419
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,709
it evaporates every ounce
of maturity we have,

420
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:44,041
and we are left to be
stubborn, angry 12 year olds.

421
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,834
Are you telling me
to grow up?
No.

422
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,208
I'm... saying

423
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,041
that you could heal
your 12 year old

424
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,625
by forgiving Frances

425
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:54,667
for all the terrible things
that she did.

426
00:19:54,709 --> 00:19:58,041
She knows she failed you.
She doesn't know anything
of the kind.

427
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,041
I talked to her, Pete.

428
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,458
Why would you do that?

429
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,792
Because you're my husband.

430
00:20:07,834 --> 00:20:11,166
Because knowing even just
a little bit about her

431
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,959
and your past helps me
to understand you better.

432
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,250
I know that this is hard--
if you want to make peace
with some parents,

433
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:20,375
why don't you start
with your own?

434
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:23,792
I've never seen you make
so much as a phone call.
Yes, yes, i--it's true. I am
asking you to do some work that

435
00:20:23,834 --> 00:20:26,792
I have not yet been able to do
on my own, but just because

436
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:29,166
that seems unfair
doesn't mean that I am wrong.

437
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,166
If you are able
to forgive Frances,

438
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:34,000
she won't be able
to control you anymore.

439
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,250
She is who she is,
you are who you are,

440
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:38,250
and the only thing
that's important

441
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,041
is how you move forward.

442
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:43,041
But that's up to you.

443
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,041
I talked to Patrick.

444
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,667
And?
He wants the awake craniotomy
because he thinks

445
00:20:49,709 --> 00:20:51,667
his grandfather
won't love him anymore

446
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:54,625
if he can't play the piano.
The grandfather told him
to get the safer surgery.

447
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:57,417
A smart kid can always feel
the truth behind the words,

448
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:59,417
and now he is making
a life-or-death decision

449
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,250
based on fear that--
lots of people do.

450
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,041
This is just wrong.

451
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:06,875
Cooper, Dennis has raised
this kid by himself

452
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:09,041
for, what, like ten years?
Yeah, I know, but--

453
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:12,041
their relationship
can't be that tenuous.

454
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,500
Look, I know seeing me
with Marla was a shock,

455
00:21:14,542 --> 00:21:17,041
and I know you two got off
on the wrong foot,

456
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,500
but if you give her a chance,
I think you'll see

457
00:21:19,542 --> 00:21:22,041
that she's really kind of
an amazing person, you--
she's a bitch.

458
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:24,041
Okay, look, she didn't like
your book.
She savaged me, Sheldon.

459
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,041
Does the entire world
need to be in love with you?

460
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,333
Are you really that insecure?
You know, Sheldon, my plate

461
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,333
is kind of full right now
with Pete and his mother

462
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,041
and teenagers
ruining their lives.

463
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,750
I don't have time
for this crap. Hello.

464
00:21:34,792 --> 00:21:36,125
Sorry we're late.

465
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:38,709
Okay, well, um, this is
the nursery, obviously.

466
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,041
So after your babies are born,
they'll be brought here

467
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:43,041
to get cleaned up
and get some tests done.

468
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:45,041
Unless they're, you know,
cut out of you.

469
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:47,041
We've all read it.
And after about an hour,

470
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:50,041
they'll be brought to your room
so that you can nurse.

471
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:53,041
Did it hurt when the crazy lady
cut it out of you?
Okay, again, this is not
about Dr. Turner.

472
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:56,959
This is about you and how
your lives are gonna change.
Okay, that is not fair.

473
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,667
She's telling us we're total
screwups, but in reality--
no one is saying that.

474
00:22:00,709 --> 00:22:02,709
Hello. Were you completely
tuned out yesterday?

475
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,792
She smushed with, like, two guys
and didn't even use protection.

476
00:22:05,834 --> 00:22:08,125
She doesn't even know
who the dad is.
She is right here.

477
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:10,625
Whatever. You didn't even
want your kid.

478
00:22:10,667 --> 00:22:13,417
At least we want our babies.
Oh, getting pregnant
for status or to get love,

479
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,417
that is selfish and immature.

480
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:18,333
Violet, that's enough.
No, no, Sheldon.
I want to help these girls,

481
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:21,208
but I'm not gonna stand here
and be abused.
Okay, please, just leave.

482
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,208
Oh! Ohh! Ah! Ah!
What's going on?

483
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,834
It feels like something's
tearing inside me. Aah!

484
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:28,166
We need a gurney here!
Lisa, call Casey's mom.

485
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:30,625
No, no, I don't need her.
Just Lisa.

486
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:33,792
Ah! What's happening?
Okay, okay,
you are bleeding inside,

487
00:22:33,834 --> 00:22:38,000
your baby is in danger, and it
needs to come out right now.
Ah! Ah!

488
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:47,375
Oh, my god.
That's disgusting.

489
00:22:47,417 --> 00:22:50,041
The delivery
isn't the hard part.

490
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:51,417
The pain is fleeting.

491
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:55,792
It's the responsibility
that's forever.

492
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:59,041
This isn't what I expected.
I mean, just look at Casey.

493
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:02,041
This is too much.
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

494
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:04,250
I'm here for you, and we'll--
we'll keep working.

495
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:08,125
No. I can't do this.

496
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,208
Is that Lucas?

497
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:39,458
I used to think
it was my fault.

498
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,041
If I was a better kid,
that you wouldn't drink.

499
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:45,458
If I was a good son, that maybe
one of the guys you brought home

500
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,458
would hang around
for more than a couple of days.

501
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,959
But... but then I had Lucas,
and...

502
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:55,500
The love I feel for him,
it just...

503
00:23:55,542 --> 00:23:57,500
Changed everything.

504
00:23:59,542 --> 00:24:02,667
How could you not feel that
for Adam and me?

505
00:24:02,709 --> 00:24:04,959
I-I was drunk
most of the time.

506
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,750
Then there were drugs.

507
00:24:06,792 --> 00:24:08,834
You know, after a while,

508
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:12,291
the person you are...
Is just gone.

509
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:18,458
Pete, I'm so sorry.

510
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,458
I don't know what to do
to make it up to you.

511
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,041
Maybe I can't.

512
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:27,125
But I love you.

513
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:33,083
Is it too late
to start over?

514
00:24:35,792 --> 00:24:38,083
Lucas, this is Frances.

515
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:42,041
She's your grandmother.

516
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:44,041
Hi. You are a big boy.

517
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:47,041
'Ight.
He looks like you.

518
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:49,250
Hello.

519
00:24:49,291 --> 00:24:50,458
Mm.

520
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,041
Yeah.

521
00:24:53,709 --> 00:24:56,208
Pete, got a second?

522
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,709
So I looked at the echo,

523
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:09,083
and the damage to her heart
is pretty extensive.

524
00:25:09,125 --> 00:25:11,709
There's nothing we can do,
Pete. I'm sorry.

525
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,500
Mama?

526
00:25:13,542 --> 00:25:15,041
How long?

527
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:17,041
Well, she's in borderline
cardiogenic shock.

528
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:19,208
She's not responding--
Sam, how long?

529
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,625
Not long.

530
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:31,041
You wanted to see me?

531
00:25:31,083 --> 00:25:33,458
I'd like to talk to you
about Patrick.

532
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,667
I assumed.

533
00:25:36,709 --> 00:25:38,458
He needs to have surgery.

534
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,041
Either surgery,
but he needs to have one.

535
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:43,041
So you two need to make
a decision,

536
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:46,041
because his tumor
is gonna keep growing and...

537
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:48,667
Do you love him?

538
00:25:48,709 --> 00:25:50,834
You have to love him.

539
00:25:50,875 --> 00:25:53,875
Just because I don't say it
doesn't mean I don't feel it

540
00:25:53,917 --> 00:25:57,041
or that Patrick
doesn't know it.
He doesn't know it.

541
00:25:57,083 --> 00:25:59,041
I mean, can't you see that?
He is terrified

542
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:01,542
that his only connection
to you is through music.

543
00:26:01,583 --> 00:26:03,500
He is willing
to paralyze himself

544
00:26:03,542 --> 00:26:06,041
because he is afraid
that without piano,

545
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:08,417
you won't connect anymore.

546
00:26:08,458 --> 00:26:11,041
You have to tell him
that you love him.

547
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:13,041
You have to say the words,

548
00:26:13,083 --> 00:26:15,583
because if you don't and we
are not able to do something,

549
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:18,000
he is gonna die.

550
00:26:18,041 --> 00:26:20,458
Don't you dare lecture me
about death.

551
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,417
Someday you will reach a point

552
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:26,041
where more of the people
you love are dead than alive,

553
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:30,041
and that, Dr. Shepherd,
is terrifying.

554
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:34,792
To lose your wife...
To a stroke

555
00:26:34,834 --> 00:26:37,208
and then your son
in a car accident--

556
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,125
I understand death.

557
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:41,667
What I don't understand
is why every feeling

558
00:26:41,709 --> 00:26:43,250
has to be communicated.

559
00:26:43,291 --> 00:26:48,333
If the love is there,
you know.

560
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:52,333
When I was a kid, my dad
was shot in front of me,

561
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:55,250
and what helped me keep going
was my mother.

562
00:26:55,291 --> 00:26:57,834
Every night before bed,

563
00:26:57,875 --> 00:26:59,834
she said, "good night.
I love you.

564
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:02,834
I will see you tomorrow,"
and there was no confusion.

565
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:04,875
There was no doubt
that she loved me

566
00:27:04,917 --> 00:27:06,458
enough for both of them.

567
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:11,250
And that even in his absence,
she would be there, always.

568
00:27:11,291 --> 00:27:13,166
Please just talk to him.

569
00:27:15,917 --> 00:27:20,208
If Patrick wants the surgery,
do it.

570
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:35,041
I thought...
Why aren't you dressed?

571
00:27:35,083 --> 00:27:38,125
I'm not going in today.

572
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:39,917
You gonna see your mother?

573
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:42,917
Maybe. I don't know.

574
00:27:42,959 --> 00:27:44,959
You don't want to do this.

575
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:48,542
Spare me
the missed opportunity speech.

576
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,750
That ship sailed
a long time ago.

577
00:27:50,792 --> 00:27:52,750
W-What, so you're gonna
walk away now?

578
00:27:52,792 --> 00:27:55,542
Look, I didn't get
the mother I wanted.

579
00:27:55,583 --> 00:27:57,709
I didn't get the mother
I deserved,

580
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,792
and it made me so angry...
I wanted her to die.

581
00:28:00,834 --> 00:28:03,041
I wished for it.

582
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:05,583
But yesterday,
for a few minutes,

583
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:07,041
it was like...

584
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:09,709
Her death
would've been easier before,

585
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:12,083
but now it's...

586
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,333
Now it's gonna hurt

587
00:28:15,375 --> 00:28:17,333
because you had a glimpse

588
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:19,333
of what could've been
between the two of you

589
00:28:19,375 --> 00:28:21,625
if things were different.

590
00:28:25,792 --> 00:28:28,041
I'm sorry, Pete.
It's gonna hurt.

591
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:30,041
I mean, there's just no way
around it.

592
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:33,041
You just
gotta get through it.

593
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:36,125
But maybe this pain
is good...

594
00:28:36,166 --> 00:28:39,875
Because it means that
somewhere inside of you

595
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:41,875
you still want to connect
with Frances,

596
00:28:41,917 --> 00:28:43,959
and now she wants that, too.

597
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,875
I mean, has it come
decades too late?

598
00:28:47,917 --> 00:28:51,041
Yeah... But...

599
00:28:53,625 --> 00:28:56,583
But maybe those patients
that you comforted

600
00:28:56,625 --> 00:28:58,667
while they died,

601
00:28:58,709 --> 00:29:03,000
maybe they were just practice
for helping your mother...

602
00:29:04,917 --> 00:29:09,542
Right here, right now.

603
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:15,458
You think he's coming?
I don't know, Cooper.

604
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,875
But he might.

605
00:29:17,917 --> 00:29:20,917
Hey. You ready?

606
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:23,667
My grandfather's
not gonna show, Dr. Freedman.

607
00:29:23,709 --> 00:29:27,291
I told you, he's only
interested in me if I can play.
You know what?
Why don't I gown up?

608
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:30,250
You don't have to
go in there alone.
I won't be.

609
00:29:30,291 --> 00:29:33,041
I've got Dr. Shepherd.
Okay.

610
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:42,208
I'm sorry I was so harsh
on you at the hospital,

611
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,834
but the book, it changes things,
you know? It just does.

612
00:29:44,875 --> 00:29:47,834
I didn't need you
to bail me out back there.
Yes, you did.

613
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:51,041
Look... I don't want this
to be adversarial betw--

614
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:53,709
you should've thought of that
before you starting smushing

615
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,875
that venomous--
don't make this about Marla.

616
00:29:56,917 --> 00:29:59,083
You know what?
Let's keep this professional.

617
00:29:59,125 --> 00:30:01,083
Fine. My professional opinion
is that

618
00:30:01,125 --> 00:30:03,250
you're not in a position
to help those girls right now.

619
00:30:03,291 --> 00:30:05,875
But I am the same therapist
as I've always been.

620
00:30:05,917 --> 00:30:08,917
I'm probably better, in fact,
but...

621
00:30:08,959 --> 00:30:10,917
What am I supposed to do?

622
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:12,917
You had something to say
and you said it.

623
00:30:12,959 --> 00:30:16,041
It's healthy for you.
It's gonna help a lot of people.

624
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:18,041
But there's a price
to be paid for that,

625
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:20,041
and that's where you are
right now.

626
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:22,125
And I'm sorry,
but that's just the reality.

627
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,959
I need to stimulate
a few more areas in your brain

628
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,959
so I know
where it's safe to cut.

629
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Just keep playing, okay,
Patrick?

Dr. Shepherd
needed to focus.

687
00:34:16,041 --> 00:34:18,041
I was too late.
I was too late.

688
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:21,041
Whatever happens,
Patrick knows you love him.

689
00:34:21,083 --> 00:34:24,333
Mm-hmm.

690
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:27,166
He's in recovery.
He had a brain hemorrhage.

691
00:34:27,208 --> 00:34:29,041
I had to evacuate
the hematoma,

692
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:32,000
but I managed to get
the bleeding under control

693
00:34:32,041 --> 00:34:34,375
and I got the whole tumor.

694
00:34:34,417 --> 00:34:37,625
Whew. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

695
00:34:37,667 --> 00:34:39,625
Uh, will he walk again?

696
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:42,458
We won't know
until the swelling goes down.

697
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,041
If we're lucky, he may end up

698
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,625
with only some mild weakness
in his leg,

699
00:34:47,667 --> 00:34:50,041
but he will play again,
so all things considered,

700
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:52,667
this was a success.
Uh, can I see him?

701
00:34:52,709 --> 00:34:54,959
Of course.

702
00:35:06,917 --> 00:35:08,917
How can you say
it's a success

703
00:35:08,959 --> 00:35:11,166
if he might
end up paralyzed?

704
00:35:13,083 --> 00:35:15,000
That's the success.

705
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:28,500
How are you doing?

706
00:35:28,542 --> 00:35:30,709
Lisa never came back.

707
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,125
Jamie called.

708
00:35:32,166 --> 00:35:35,000
She's giving her baby up
for adoption.

709
00:35:35,041 --> 00:35:37,792
So much for the pact.

710
00:35:37,834 --> 00:35:41,125
And has your mom been by?

711
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:44,166
To criticize me and yell.

712
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:47,583
She's not gonna come around
on this.

713
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:52,333
How am I supposed to do this
by myself?

714
00:35:52,375 --> 00:35:56,041
I'm totally alone.

715
00:35:56,083 --> 00:35:59,000
Did you decide on a name?

716
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:01,041
Ben.

717
00:36:01,083 --> 00:36:04,166
Well, then you're not alone.
You've got Ben.

718
00:36:04,208 --> 00:36:07,208
I'm scared.

719
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:09,542
Well, we can work on that.

720
00:36:16,542 --> 00:36:19,417
I read your book,
all of it.

721
00:36:21,166 --> 00:36:23,208
And?

722
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,834
I can't believe
how much you've been through.

723
00:36:25,875 --> 00:36:27,834
It must have been really hard.

724
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:30,542
Um, yeah.
Well, you know, it was.

725
00:36:30,583 --> 00:36:32,166
But, um...

726
00:36:32,208 --> 00:36:34,750
You know,
I got through it.

727
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:37,375
When I saw Casey...

728
00:36:37,417 --> 00:36:40,000
That little person
just kind of came out of her,

729
00:36:40,041 --> 00:36:42,041
and it just suddenly
became real.

730
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:43,875
Like...

731
00:36:43,917 --> 00:36:46,792
I feel like
I've really screwed up.

732
00:36:46,834 --> 00:36:49,166
I look at my mom,
and she tries to be nice,

733
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:52,375
but she already
has three kids.

734
00:36:52,417 --> 00:36:54,041
She doesn't need
another one.

735
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:57,959
Well, this won't be her child.
It'll be yours.

736
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,041
I know.

737
00:37:01,083 --> 00:37:04,041
But I...
But I need her.

738
00:37:04,083 --> 00:37:06,041
I really need my mom.

739
00:37:06,083 --> 00:37:10,000
And watching Casey,
I just...

740
00:37:10,041 --> 00:37:12,375
Knew that
I'm gonna need help,

741
00:37:12,417 --> 00:37:15,417
and I don't want to be
any more of a burden.

742
00:37:15,458 --> 00:37:18,250
My mom doesn't deserve that.

743
00:37:18,291 --> 00:37:20,250
Well, look...

744
00:37:20,291 --> 00:37:24,625
Family is... hard.

745
00:37:24,667 --> 00:37:26,291
It just is.

746
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:29,792
But your mother
will understand,

747
00:37:29,834 --> 00:37:33,166
because she already knows what
I've been trying to tell you--

748
00:37:33,208 --> 00:37:35,041
that from this moment on,

749
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:39,041
your primary focus has to be
the well-being of your child.

750
00:37:39,083 --> 00:37:42,166
That's...

751
00:37:42,208 --> 00:37:45,917
That's why I left my son
with his father,

752
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:50,041
because I couldn't take care
of him, and...

753
00:37:50,083 --> 00:37:52,750
And he deserved better.

754
00:37:52,792 --> 00:37:54,875
Just like you said
in the book.

755
00:37:54,917 --> 00:37:57,041
Just like I said
in the book.

756
00:37:57,083 --> 00:38:00,625
I don't know if I want
to keep this baby anymore.

757
00:38:00,667 --> 00:38:04,542
Maybe I do.
I'm just not sure.

758
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:08,041
But I don't know how to talk
to my mom about this.

759
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:11,000
Well, why don't we
talk to her together?

760
00:38:21,583 --> 00:38:23,041
Hi.

761
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:25,458
Here's the thing--
I don't know your father,

762
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,458
and maybe
when you were a newborn,

763
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,041
he did look at you
and wish that you were Andy,

764
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:32,041
'cause frankly,
babies all look the same.

765
00:38:32,083 --> 00:38:34,875
They're all bald,
wailing poop machines.

766
00:38:34,917 --> 00:38:38,542
But the minute you started
to grow, you were Cooper,

767
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:42,000
not some replacement child.

768
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:49,000
What did you do?

769
00:38:50,583 --> 00:38:52,875
Oh. Oh.

770
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:58,917
You can't give up

771
00:38:58,959 --> 00:39:01,417
not ever.

772
00:39:01,458 --> 00:39:02,792
Go.

773
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:07,041

She opened herself up
for this book,

778
00:39:35,834 --> 00:39:37,792
and you wrote
a-a tough review.

779
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:40,000
The book is already causing
problems with patients.

780
00:39:40,041 --> 00:39:42,375
And--and then she sees you
with me--
so what? My interaction

781
00:39:42,417 --> 00:39:44,542
My interaction

and I don't like that feeling.
