00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,417
Naomi's okay with it?
Yes.

3
00:00:16,458 --> 00:00:17,834
With you and me,
she's okay with it?

4
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:20,041
Yes.

5
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:21,625
You told her
we were sleeping together,

6
00:00:21,667 --> 00:00:23,041
and she's fine with that?

7
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:25,834
Sam.
No, I'm just saying.

8
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:27,250
Her ex-husband
and best friend

9
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:29,959
doing all kinds of pervy,
hot, nasty, sexy...

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,041
Okay,
she was surprised, yes,

11
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:32,458
but, you know,
we drank some wine.

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,834
We did what we do,
and in the end, she was fine.

13
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,875
I mean, it's okay.
She's okay.

14
00:00:36,917 --> 00:00:38,542
If you say so.

15
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:43,625
Sam, why can't you believe
that she's okay?

16
00:00:44,834 --> 00:00:47,625
Would you be?

17
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:51,792
Running's for idiots.

18
00:00:51,834 --> 00:00:55,375
Oh, it's so good having you
living here again.

19
00:00:55,417 --> 00:00:59,500
It makes my mornings 100 percent
more interesting.

20
00:00:59,542 --> 00:01:02,709
And the evenings? Whew.

21
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,208
Yeah,
they're pretty awesome too.

22
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:23,792
Whoa. Hey, could you hold that?
Whew.

23
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,041
Where you going?
Fifth floor.

24
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:29,709
Me too.

25
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:32,917
First visit?

26
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,500
Yeah. I've, uh,
been avoiding this.

27
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:39,709
Don't worry. You're gonna love
everybody in there.

28
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,333
Oh, sorry.
Hey.

29
00:01:43,542 --> 00:01:45,959
You cannot be here.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,542
Who needs cereal when you can
have chocolate cupcakes?

31
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:57,834
You take my husband and all
I get are chocolate cupcakes?

32
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:00,250
Wha--? Uh...

33
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:01,667
Wow, as far as guilt gifts go,

34
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:02,875
you kind of cheaped out
a little.

35
00:02:02,917 --> 00:02:04,959
No, no, Nai. That's not
what this is. I, uh...

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,041
I didn't mean to, um...

37
00:02:10,792 --> 00:02:13,458
I'm kidding.

38
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,750
Oh.

39
00:02:15,792 --> 00:02:18,041
Good.
I'm fine, Addison.

40
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:21,041
I'm okay. I'm fine.
We're fine.

41
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:22,333
Mm.
Okay.

42
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:26,458
Well, um, thank you
for being so understanding, Nai.

43
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,917
Well,
I'm not doing it for you.

44
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:30,750
With Dell and Maya and William,
I'm just, uh--

45
00:02:30,792 --> 00:02:32,500
I'm letting it all go.

46
00:02:32,542 --> 00:02:35,166
I'm just-- I'm done carrying
around all my anger.

47
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:37,709
Sam:
Get the hell out of here.

48
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,333
Get the hell out of here.
Pete: Easy, Sam.

49
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:41,083
You got some nerve
showing up like this.

50
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:42,542
I need to talk to you.
What's going on?

51
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,083
It's the guy that hit
Maya and Dell.

52
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,792
Hagen:
I am so sorry.

53
00:02:45,834 --> 00:02:48,583
No. No. You don't get a chance
to be sorry.

54
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,375
He doesn't get a chance
to apologize.

55
00:02:50,417 --> 00:02:52,041
Is that--?
That's the guy.

56
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:54,041
I would give anything
to take it back, but I can't.

57
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:56,417
Look, I made a deal with the
prosecutor. I'm being sentenced.

58
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:59,125
I'll go to jail. I deserve that.
But I just wanted--

59
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,792
I don't know.
If you could forgive me?

60
00:03:01,834 --> 00:03:03,542
Sam!
Hey!

61
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,625
As far as I'm concerned--
Addison: Let him go. Sam.

62
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:07,083
--You shouldn't even be alive.

63
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,625
Let him go right now, Sam.
Cooper: Sam.

64
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:11,792
Someone call 911.

65
00:03:11,834 --> 00:03:14,041
Hagen: Oh, my chest.
Addison: Get the oxygen.

66
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:18,250
Take slow, deep breaths.
Breathe. Breathe.

67
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,125
Sam, I know you're upset,
but to choke this man...

68
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:26,458
Do you--?
Do you know I'm upset?

69
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,000
Yes, of course,
I understand, but...

70
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,041
Sam:
Because you should've been
choking him with me.

71
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,959
Why?
Instead of standing back...

72
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,750
What do you expect me to do?
I expect you to back me up.

73
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:36,166
Back you up?
She's your daughter.

74
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:37,583
Of course.
I want you to remember.

75
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,041
Naomi:
I went through the same thing.

76
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,625
Sam:
Remember her in that bed.

77
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:43,041
What's that about?
Chickens coming home to roost.

78
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,500
What if you killed that man?
We...

79
00:03:44,542 --> 00:03:45,917
Can somebody translate?

80
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,041
The guy who killed Dell
showed up to apologize.

81
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:51,583
And Sam took matters into his
own hands literally, like:

82
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,458
Well, good for Sam.

83
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,583
The guy should've just crawled
into a hole and disappeared.

84
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,041
Give the guy credit
for having the guts

85
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,667
to walk through the door
and face all of us.

86
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:01,458
He had to know the reception
he was gonna get.

87
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,041
Pete:
If he almost killed my kid,

88
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:06,041
I'd make sure he rotted in
prison for the rest of his life.

89
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,417
Don't you have things to do?
Charlotte: I don't think so.

90
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:10,083
I'm kind of clear.

91
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,250
Naomi:
I hate what he did
every bit as much as you,

92
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,041
but that doesn't mean
you can go and attack him.

93
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,709
Why are you defending him?
I am not defending him, Sam.

94
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,250
But he did come here
to apologize.

95
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,041
Apologize?

96
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:24,333
Apologize for killing Dell
and almost killing our daughter?

97
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,834
What kind of apology--?
Sam, I don't know!

98
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,041
I don't know. You didn't give
the man a chance to speak.

99
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:32,917
I spoke to the hospital
and, um,

100
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,041
Troy hagen is stable,

101
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:37,291
but his EKG does show signs
of new changes.

102
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,125
Sam, are you okay?

103
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,625
I don't know what that guy needs
to say to make you feel good

104
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:46,500
about him getting drunk
and driving into Maya and Dell.

105
00:04:46,542 --> 00:04:49,667
He killed a man.
He doesn't get my forgiveness.

106
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:51,500
Maybe you can calm him down.

107
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:53,125
Sam, can we please--?

108
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:56,291
Some things don't deserve
to be forgiven.

109
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,291
Man:
What do we have?

110
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:03,667
Forty-five-year-old teacher,

111
00:05:03,709 --> 00:05:05,333
passed out in the middle
of a school play.

112
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:08,041
Now he's complaining
about persistent chest pains.

113
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:09,667
It looks like an acute mi.

114
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,750
What's your plan?
He needs to go up for bypass.

115
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,333
I've got a stab wound
to the chest to deal with.

116
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,291
Get him to the or.
If you need any help--

117
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,458
I'm good.
You sure?

118
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,458
Absolutely.

119
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:28,041
Okay, thanks. Let's go.

120
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,583
Child:
When is he coming back?

121
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,750
The kids refused to finish the
show. They're really worried.

122
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,542
We're gonna do the best we can,
sir.

123
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,291
Okay, so I guess this means
no dinner?

124
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,291
Oh, no.

125
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,625
We were to meet
Derek and Addison

126
00:05:40,667 --> 00:05:42,125
at the restaurant
in 20 minutes.

127
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,709
Oh, well, there's Addison,

128
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,500
so I guess Derek's
at the restaurant by himself.

129
00:05:45,542 --> 00:05:47,125
You're doing a bypass
on your own.

130
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,583
Yeah. I just got it.
Yeah?

131
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,500
Well, I just picked up
a bilateral oophorectomy.

132
00:05:50,542 --> 00:05:52,041
I don't start cutting
for a couple hours.

133
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,125
Maybe, uh, I can watch?

134
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,083
All right, you guys have fun.

135
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,750
I have a baby-sitter
and Derek made the reservations.

136
00:05:57,792 --> 00:05:59,417
I'm having dinner
with your husband.

137
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:00,792
I'll try not to steal him.

138
00:06:00,834 --> 00:06:03,041
Apologize to Derek for me?
Naomi: Okay.

139
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:05,375
Bye-bye.

140
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:06,458
What's wrong?

141
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,375
Do me a favor.
Take this to radiology.

142
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:10,458
Ask them for a ct angio
before the or.

143
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,583
Sure.
Thanks.

144
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:12,834
All right, come on, guys.

145
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:14,834
Is it worse than you thought?
Uh, it might be.

146
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,834
I just-- if there's a chance
I'm not gonna make it,

147
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:20,333
I need to talk to somebody.
We can do that for you.

148
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,750
Do you need a priest?
I've done some bad things.

149
00:06:22,792 --> 00:06:25,583
And every day I tell myself
that I'm gonna stop,

150
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:28,041
but I can't.
Mr. Yates.

151
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:31,625
I know they're only children,
but I can't help myself.

152
00:06:31,667 --> 00:06:34,041
I need to touch them.

153
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,959
I try, but I can't stop.

154
00:06:39,417 --> 00:06:41,041
And I'm so sorry.

155
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,583
Hey. Are you okay?

156
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,208
I will be.

157
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,917
I was with that guy
on the elevator.

158
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:57,375
He seemed nice.

159
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,333
I had no idea.

160
00:07:00,834 --> 00:07:03,625
Maybe this is not a good time.
No, please, distract me.

161
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:06,208
Okay. You should hire me.

162
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,834
Don't beat around the bush
on my account.

163
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:10,041
Well, you've got
a nice little practice here.

164
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,250
The baby thing is covered.

165
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:12,834
You've got shrinks
for the screw-ups.

166
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:15,542
Specialists to handle everything
from heart attacks to hernias.

167
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:18,750
What you don't have
is a neurosurgeon.

168
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:20,625
I'm listening.

169
00:07:20,667 --> 00:07:22,125
I graduated
top of my class at Harvard.

170
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,959
I did my residency
at Johns Hopkins.

171
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,542
I have published
enough research

172
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,959
to single-handedly wipe out
several forests.

173
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,834
I'm the real deal, Naomi.

174
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:32,041
I'm a kick-ass,
world-class catch.

175
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:35,250
Did Addison coach you
on how to sell yourself?

176
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,542
No, we haven't discussed it yet.

177
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:39,250
But you are the big boss now,
right?

178
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:42,041
Look, Amelia, you obviously have
impressive credentials.

179
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,750
But this practice
is about cooperative medicine,

180
00:07:44,792 --> 00:07:46,166
not solo surgeries.

181
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,667
You could go anywhere you want.
Why here?

182
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:52,041
I like to cut.
I won't deny that.

183
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,542
But...

184
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:56,041
I think that this would be
a good environment

185
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,583
for me to broaden my skill set.

186
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,333
Don't give me
the rehearsed answer.

187
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:05,458
I have nowhere else to go

188
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,667
where I'm not alone.

189
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:08,750
Derek forgave me, but...

190
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,333
I have nowhere else to go.

191
00:08:15,792 --> 00:08:17,750
Oh, hey.
I just wanted to let you know

192
00:08:17,792 --> 00:08:19,041
I ordered us the new bed today.

193
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,709
I hope you like it.
Don't see why I wouldn't.

194
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,792
Well, you know,
it's a lot firmer.

195
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:24,333
It's basically
just a wooden plank.

196
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:25,959
I don't know
if that's your thing, but...

197
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,333
Oh, yeah,
and we're getting a dog.

198
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,166
A mastiff, 160 pounds,
very drooly.

199
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,542
Gonna sleep in the bed with us.

200
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,959
Dog whisperer, whatever
you've gotta say, spit it out.

201
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,583
Because I have to get
to the hospital

202
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:37,125
before hagen's heart Peters out
or Sam rips it from his chest.

203
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:40,583
Why are you house-hunting
without me?

204
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,625
Pull up your bra strap, Coop.

205
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:44,333
I hired a realtor
when you kicked me out.

206
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:45,583
Then we got engaged,

207
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,333
so I told her to look
for something bigger.

208
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:48,792
It's a house, Charlotte.

209
00:08:48,834 --> 00:08:51,291
It's kind of a big deal.

210
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:55,750
Okay, but we need to move.

211
00:08:55,792 --> 00:08:57,458
What's wrong with the loft?

212
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,417
It's too grungy. Your neighbors
are freakishly chipper.

213
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,583
And it'd be nice
to sleep with you

214
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,041
in a place
that wasn't a fond memory

215
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,417
for half the tramps in L.A.

216
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:05,792
You know that's not fair.

217
00:09:05,834 --> 00:09:08,000
I went out of my way to make
that place feel like ours.

218
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,792
I took down
all the vintage Houdini posters.

219
00:09:09,834 --> 00:09:11,583
I let you re-do the bathroom
the way you like.

220
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:12,875
I'm doing cartwheels.

221
00:09:12,917 --> 00:09:14,250
Can we at least agree
it's something

222
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,291
that we should consider
together?

223
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,000
Fine.

224
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:23,583
Seeing a house in the palisades
tomorrow, 8:00.

225
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,667
Stop whining
and you can join me.

226
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:32,041
This guy, he's got a piece of
phosphorous stuck in his thigh.

227
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,083
He's screaming like hell
because that stuff burns.

228
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,166
A bullet wound in his back--

229
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,166
Pete's got his hand on my shirt

230
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,875
and he's trying to drag me out
of the hut.

231
00:09:38,917 --> 00:09:40,583
Pete:
The hut was on fire.

232
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,291
Ugandan rebel army
was about to get there--

233
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,500
it was Eritrea. And I wasn't
gonna leave the guy.

234
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:47,041
Uganda. And it was either leave
you there or let you get shot.

235
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:49,750
Can somebody tell me
what happened to the guy?

236
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,667
We got him out.

237
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,625
We stabilized him,

238
00:09:56,667 --> 00:09:58,208
then together we carried him
four miles

239
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,542
to the nearest refugee camp.

240
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:03,125
You know, Violet,
I like you.

241
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,333
You're beautiful, you're smart.

242
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,333
What the hell are you doing
with this guy?

243
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:08,667
I haven't figured that out yet.

244
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:10,667
Would you stop flirting?
Get your own wife.

245
00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:14,041
This is ridiculous. You've been
in town running your clinic

246
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,208
for, what, six months,

247
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,500
and this is the first time
we've met?

248
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:18,542
Gibby is impossible
to nail down.

249
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,041
The guy doesn't even have
a cell phone.

250
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,500
Never found much use for them
in the jungle.

251
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,583
Excuse me.

252
00:10:31,542 --> 00:10:35,041
Come in. Come in.
Dr. Gibson, it's my husband.

253
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:39,041
We were making dinner and he had
bad pains in his belly.

254
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,583
It's getting worse.

255
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:47,583
Rock hard.
Could be a perfed appy.

256
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,000
I'll call an ambulance.
No, wait.

257
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:56,291
Give me a hand. On three.
One, two, three.

258
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,583
Take him down there.

259
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:11,041
What are you doing?

260
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,000
Saving his life.

261
00:11:17,792 --> 00:11:20,625
Come on, gibby. We can drive him
to the hospital right now.

262
00:11:27,792 --> 00:11:28,750
This is insane.

263
00:11:28,792 --> 00:11:30,166
You could lose your license.

264
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,750
You could be sued
for malpractice.

265
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:34,667
Or I could save his life so his
wife doesn't become a widow,

266
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:36,792
so his kids don't lose
their father.

267
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:43,000
The belly's full of pus.
I could really use a hand.

268
00:11:44,792 --> 00:11:46,333
Okay.
Pete.

269
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,000
Just until we get him
stabilized.

270
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,417
And then I'm out of here.
I promise.

271
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,542
Uh, I'm tired.

272
00:12:26,709 --> 00:12:28,834
Sam, you had a right
to get angry today.

273
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,041
I know.
I mean, he hit Maya.

274
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,667
I don't wanna talk about it.

275
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:34,417
Sam--
I'm tired.

276
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,542
Good night.

277
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,417
Hey. What do you think,

278
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:58,041
diplomas behind the desk
or on the side wall?

279
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,917
So this is one of the things
you were gonna catch me up on?

280
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,458
Pretty cool, huh?
Can you hand me that box?

281
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,625
Sure.

282
00:13:06,667 --> 00:13:08,542
Hey, I hope I didn't keep you up
last night.

283
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:10,500
I was nervous
about Naomi's decision,

284
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:12,250
so I just got up
and watched a movie.

285
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,709
Uh, no, I was at Sam's.

286
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,125
I didn't even know
you were in the house.

287
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:19,917
So, um, how was Seattle?

288
00:13:21,792 --> 00:13:24,667
I had sex with Mark Sloan.
That man has skills.

289
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,917
Face like an angel,
hips like the devil, huh? Ha-ha.

290
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,500
Right?
Right.

291
00:13:31,542 --> 00:13:33,041
Anyway,
it's all turning around for me.

292
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:35,000
I mean,
Derek and I are back on track

293
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,583
and I am starting
this fantastic new job.

294
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:40,083
New job.
What?

295
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,291
It's just a little weird

296
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,083
that Naomi didn't mention this
to me.

297
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:45,709
We usually-- we make these
decisions as a group.

298
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,792
Oh, she probably figured
you wouldn't mind.

299
00:13:49,542 --> 00:13:50,792
I mean, you don't, do you?

300
00:13:50,834 --> 00:13:52,834
No, of course not.

301
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,208
First earthquake,

302
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,166
that house just tumbles
right down that hill.

303
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:05,166
Being on a hill is what gives it
those amazing ocean views.

304
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,542
It's gonna have
an even better view

305
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:08,208
when it lands
in the actual ocean.

306
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,583
You're just punishing me

307
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,041
because I started looking
without you.

308
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,625
You're not listening,
Charlotte.

309
00:14:12,667 --> 00:14:14,583
I don't wanna look at all.

310
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:17,458
Well, I hate your place, Cooper.

311
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,750
Because it reminds me of all
the things I screwed up,

312
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,542
all the fights we had.

313
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,959
You not letting me in the front
door after you found out

314
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,750
I was building
the practice downstairs.

315
00:14:25,792 --> 00:14:28,417
Standing like an idiot with the
corn bread chicken casserole

316
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,125
in your bedroom,
trying to make up

317
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,667
after I tried to force you
to elope.

318
00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:34,041
Fighting over
that damn latex jumpsuit

319
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,625
after I bought you
into the practice.

320
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,375
And we can't move forward

321
00:14:38,417 --> 00:14:40,166
if that's staring me in the face
every day.

322
00:14:41,792 --> 00:14:44,375
You never told me
any of this.

323
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:46,583
Well, now you know.

324
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,625
So...

325
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:53,041
Amelia works here now.

326
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,834
Yeah, I know. I hired her.

327
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:59,875
It's a little weird that you
decided without telling me.

328
00:14:59,917 --> 00:15:03,208
Well, you decided to sleep
with my ex without telling me.

329
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,500
Wow.

330
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:12,875
Seriously?
Well, you know--

331
00:15:12,917 --> 00:15:14,709
babies are tiny terrorists.

332
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,625
I'm dying
from sleep deprivation.

333
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:18,083
Lucas was up five times
last night.

334
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:21,667
Where was Pete?
He was operating. In a house.

335
00:15:21,709 --> 00:15:23,667
His friend runs
a neighborhood clinic

336
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:24,959
and he sees no problem

337
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,625
with performing emergency
surgeries there.

338
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:28,709
I-- that cannot be legal.

339
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,542
Probably not the biggest concern
his patients have.

340
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,041
He's doing surgeries in a house.

341
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,417
Well, I didn't say I agreed
with it, but I get it.

342
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:36,875
The people he treats probably
don't have money or insurance.

343
00:15:36,917 --> 00:15:39,083
They're scared of trying
to navigate the system--

344
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,709
even a county hospital
is better equipped

345
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,667
to deal with emergencies
than someone's living room.

346
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,500
We're talking surgery
in an unsterile environment.

347
00:15:46,542 --> 00:15:48,542
The risk of staph infection
is huge and--

348
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,959
because nobody ever got
a staph infection in a hospital.

349
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,041
Okay. Fine. Well, what about
if something goes wrong?

350
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:56,041
Gibby doesn't have the resources
to deal with that.

351
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:58,000
Things go wrong
in hospitals too.

352
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,000
And I'm minding my own business.

353
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,542
I know you're mad
that I stayed but--

354
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,875
that guy could have died.

355
00:16:04,917 --> 00:16:07,041
But he didn't and he's home
recovering with his family.

356
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:08,750
So that justifies
what you did?

357
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:10,375
I helped a friend
save a guy's life.

358
00:16:10,417 --> 00:16:12,750
Gibby is helping himself.
Look, I know.

359
00:16:12,792 --> 00:16:14,667
I know he's trying to do
something good here,

360
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:16,041
but there's--
there's better ways.

361
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,166
There's safer ways
of doing that.

362
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:21,667
Only none of them feed the god
complex that he's got going on.

363
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:29,041
The patient has cad
with crescendo angina.

364
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,709
My plan is to cool him down,
then do a three-way bypass.

365
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,625
I'll schedule an or
for you.

366
00:16:37,542 --> 00:16:40,125
I called in Campbell
to handle Mr. Hagen's case.

367
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,750
She's gonna do a cabg.

368
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,625
I don't wanna know.
Okay. I respect that.

369
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:51,583
You want me to leave this up?

370
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,166
What? No.

371
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:57,000
Are you sure, Sam?
Yeah, I gotta go.

372
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:01,041
Hagen did ask
to speak to you.

373
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,208
I told him I'd pass it along.

374
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,041
I told you
I don't wanna deal with this.

375
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,375
Addison:
What is it?

376
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:16,792
Sam:
Double lumen on a aortic arch.

377
00:17:16,834 --> 00:17:19,375
A dissecting aneurysm?
Yeah.

378
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:20,625
A different surgery
altogether.

379
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:22,375
Are you gonna get
your attending up here?

380
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:24,542
No. I'm gonna scrub in.

381
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,458
Are you sure?

382
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,917
He's a child molester.
What?

383
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:32,875
He thinks that he's gonna die,

384
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:35,458
so he wanted to get it
off his chest.

385
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,000
He's a pedophile.
Sam.

386
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,792
I'm doing the surgery.

387
00:17:42,834 --> 00:17:44,166
I can handle it.

388
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,500
Hey.
Hold still.

389
00:17:52,834 --> 00:17:55,083
One more minute.

390
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:57,709
Hey.
You're back.

391
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,000
And with gifts.

392
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,583
I noticed you were running low
on supplies.

393
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:03,667
Oh, thanks, man. You're a
lifesaver. Last night too.

394
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:05,583
I hope that didn't rock the boat
at home.

395
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,375
It'll blow over.

396
00:18:07,417 --> 00:18:09,667
Listen, I've been thinking about
your setup here

397
00:18:09,709 --> 00:18:12,917
and I've got some contacts
at surgery centers.

398
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:15,500
Let me see what kind of deal
I can work out for you.

399
00:18:15,542 --> 00:18:18,041
Pete, most of my patients
don't even have cars.

400
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:20,667
None of them wanna be part of
a system that's failed them.

401
00:18:20,709 --> 00:18:23,041
I'm fine with what I got.
One surgery goes wrong--

402
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,834
I don't remember you
being such a worrier.

403
00:18:26,709 --> 00:18:28,083
What's wrong
with that little girl?

404
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,625
I don't know. I haven't had time
to check her out yet.

405
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:32,041
This is triage, man.
You know the game.

406
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,667
The sicker ones go first.

407
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:39,583
Hi.
Can I look at your arm?

408
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:50,083
It's popped out of its socket.
Here. It's okay.

409
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,583
There. Okay?

410
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,000
Okay.

411
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:05,792
Okay. Who's next?

412
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,583
Troy hagen's
refusing treatment.

413
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,250
But he has unstable angina.

414
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,041
He's gonna die
if he doesn't have surgery.

415
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,458
Seems to be the point.
Well, it's his choice.

416
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,542
Maybe he's trying to skip jail?

417
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:23,083
He's not. He feels like
he doesn't deserve to live.

418
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,375
Well, has anyone asked Sam
to talk to him?

419
00:19:25,417 --> 00:19:26,959
Asked Sam to talk to who
about what?

420
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,542
Someone has to convince hagen
to have surgery.

421
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:30,959
Why?

422
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,208
I thought you guys
were all into helping people.

423
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,375
Oh, screw him.

424
00:19:35,417 --> 00:19:37,041
I get that you're
emotional about this.

425
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,333
I mean, the guy made a mistake.

426
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,000
Does that mean
that he deserves to die?

427
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,208
Isn't the question whether
we have to go out of our way

428
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,542
to help him live?

429
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:53,125
Hey. Where have you been?
Hey.

430
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,542
I've been calling you
for hours.

431
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,166
I was at the clinic
with gibby.

432
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,041
I was treating patients.

433
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,542
You missed
three appointments.

434
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:02,041
I know.
I'll ask them to reschedule.

435
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,458
I've decided to volunteer at the
clinic one afternoon a week.

436
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,250
Pete.
There were 20 people

437
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,041
in his waiting room
and more standing outside.

438
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,041
People who have nowhere to go,
who need help.

439
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:13,000
You help people here every day.
It's not the same.

440
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,250
Our clients have money, they can
pay for the care we give.

441
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:17,625
These people have nothing.
They need me.

442
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:19,041
I get it.
And it's noble.

443
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,125
It's just too risky, you know.

444
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,750
For gibby, for the patients,
for you.

445
00:20:22,792 --> 00:20:24,041
Okay, spare me the sermon.

446
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,792
I don't wanna give you
a sermon. I just--

447
00:20:25,834 --> 00:20:27,583
I want you to think
about what you're doing.

448
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,041
I know what I'm doing,
Violet.

449
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:45,041
I thought you'd
already be cutting.

450
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,000
Hey. I'm heading in right now.

451
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:49,250
Well, I'm glad I caught you.
Um...

452
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:53,291
I wore this cap for my first
solo surgery, so it's good luck.

453
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,166
Well, I'm already scrubbed in,
so could you?

454
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,125
Sure.

455
00:20:58,709 --> 00:21:01,000
You okay?
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

456
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,083
Sam.
Hmm?

457
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:08,041
You can do this.
Yeah, I know I can.

458
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,709
I've done grafts
on a hundred pig hearts.

459
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,375
It's not what I meant.

460
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,500
I have a daughter, Addison.

461
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:19,041
A daughter who's younger
than those kids waiting.

462
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,333
It's irrelevant.

463
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:21,667
Irrelevant?
You're his surgeon.

464
00:21:21,709 --> 00:21:23,083
Only thing
that should concern you.

465
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,500
Your job isn't to judge his
life.

466
00:21:24,542 --> 00:21:26,041
Your job is to save his life.
That's all.

467
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,500
Right?

468
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Hey. I--

469
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:49,709
you need to convince Sam
to talk to Troy hagen.

470
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,667
I thought we weren't talking
about Sam.

471
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:53,583
No, I can talk about Sam.
You don't get to.

472
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:56,291
But, uh, you do need
to straighten him out.

473
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,792
This is not something that is up
for discussion with him.

474
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:00,375
I know Sam and--

475
00:22:00,417 --> 00:22:02,583
no, no. I know Sam.
You're just sleeping with him.

476
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,166
I'm sorry.

477
00:22:08,792 --> 00:22:11,375
I'm sorry.

478
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:14,709
You really wanna be with Sam?

479
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,709
You need to be with him.

480
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,583
You got to be his sounding
board. His conscience.

481
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:22,834
You need to kick him in
the behind when he needs it.

482
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:25,041
You've got a stubborn man
on your hands, Addison,

483
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:27,625
and it's not okay to just walk
away when things get hard.

484
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:32,417
Step up.

485
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:46,792
Hey, you're not gonna tell Pete,
are you?

486
00:22:46,834 --> 00:22:49,625
What? That we're having lunch
on a non-prescribed day?

487
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:51,250
I'm gonna keep Charlotte
in the dark.

488
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:53,208
I don't even think Pete
would care now.

489
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,583
All he's thinking about
is how to get back to the jungle

490
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:58,041
where he can perform open-heart
surgery with a pen-knife.

491
00:22:58,083 --> 00:22:59,875
You hate the jungle.
You don't like grass.

492
00:22:59,917 --> 00:23:02,625
I think he's struggling
with the path not taken.

493
00:23:02,667 --> 00:23:04,458
Wait, I thought he already
took that path

494
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,041
and then got off, didn't--?

495
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:07,250
Well, being around gibby

496
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:09,750
has obviously tapped
into something, you know.

497
00:23:09,792 --> 00:23:12,000
He's so--
he's so happy and re-energized.

498
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:14,500
And, no, I want him to be happy.
I do. I just--

499
00:23:14,542 --> 00:23:17,250
not at any cost.

500
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:19,041
Pete's no dummy.
He's making a choice.

501
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:22,000
Just like Charlotte who's just
deciding she hates my apartment.

502
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:23,667
We're on to you now?
She wants to move.

503
00:23:23,709 --> 00:23:26,291
It's your bachelor pad, Cooper.
You can't blame her.

504
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:29,041
No more than you can
blame Pete.

505
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:31,500
So, what are we gonna do?

506
00:23:31,542 --> 00:23:33,709
Well,
you're the shrink.

507
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,917
What would you tell
a patient?

508
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:41,041
I would say you have to confront
your problems.

509
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:43,542
Be honest. And then, you know,
whatever happens, happens.

510
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:46,208
People pay you for that?

511
00:23:52,667 --> 00:23:54,625
Hey.

512
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:57,041
Wow, that looks like
not even a little bit fun.

513
00:23:57,083 --> 00:24:00,166
Yeah. It's just this
foundation paperwork.

514
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:01,667
I-I don't even know
where to begin.

515
00:24:01,709 --> 00:24:03,041
Much more interested
in just looking

516
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:05,542
at pictures of Olivia.
Aww.

517
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:09,458
Okay, that baby has my ears too.
It must be me.

518
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,041
I have baby ears.

519
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:14,542
Let me see. No.

520
00:24:16,959 --> 00:24:18,750
Did you need something?

521
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:23,250
Well, I just wanted to make sure
that you were okay.

522
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:24,500
Oh.

523
00:24:24,542 --> 00:24:27,125
Having Troy hagen show up,
yeah, that really threw me.

524
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,250
Yeah.

525
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:30,959
And I miss William.

526
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,166
But I was talking more about
the whole Sam and Addison thing.

527
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:37,291
And I know from having to watch
Violet and Pete,

528
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:38,583
and Charlotte and Cooper,

529
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:40,959
that it can make work
a little awkward.

530
00:24:41,041 --> 00:24:43,041
I'm fine. You know, Sam and I,
we had our shot.

531
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:45,041
And seems only fair
that he and Addison

532
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,125
should have theirs, so I'm fine.

533
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:48,083
Well, that's an admirable
position to take.

534
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:50,166
I don't wanna be someone
who can't move forward.

535
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:53,041
Sure. Sure.

536
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:55,625
But sometimes what we wanna be
and what we actually feel

537
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:58,625
can be two different things.

538
00:24:58,667 --> 00:25:02,417
I'm not proud of it,
but once when no one was around,

539
00:25:02,458 --> 00:25:03,875
I licked Pete's bagel.

540
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:07,041
Okay, I'm a little proud of it.

541
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:10,500
My point is that you should
give yourself permission

542
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:12,750
to use whatever kind
of a coping mechanism you need.

543
00:25:12,792 --> 00:25:14,625
Screaming, crying,

544
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:17,709
maybe even a dart board
with both their faces.

545
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,000
Do whatever you need to do.

546
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:24,542
Trust me, I'm licensed to give
that kind of advice.

547
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:34,125
Violet:
What are you doing?

548
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:36,375
Gibby called.
He has an emergency.

549
00:25:36,417 --> 00:25:38,041
Call an ambulance.
Let them deal with it.

550
00:25:38,083 --> 00:25:39,250
That's not the way this works.

551
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:40,875
That's exactly
how this works.

552
00:25:40,917 --> 00:25:42,041
When you have an emergency,

553
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:44,000
call 911 and they take you
to the hospital.

554
00:25:45,792 --> 00:25:47,625
I knew you wouldn't understand.
Then talk to me.

555
00:25:47,667 --> 00:25:51,458
Explain to me why my husband
would risk everything,

556
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,834
his practice, his medical
license, his family,

557
00:25:54,875 --> 00:25:57,041
because some old ghost
from his past asked him to.

558
00:25:58,583 --> 00:26:00,583
I miss this kind of work, okay?

559
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:03,083
The rush of it.
The way it makes me feel.

560
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:06,875
I knew you wouldn't understand.
Hey, hey, hey.

561
00:26:06,917 --> 00:26:09,083
I used to work
with inner-city single moms.

562
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:10,625
I used to counsel rape victims.

563
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:13,625
I ran a suicide hotline.
I do understand.

564
00:26:13,667 --> 00:26:15,375
But I didn't break any laws
doing it.

565
00:26:15,417 --> 00:26:17,041
Don't wait up.

566
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:34,250
Why are you lurking?

567
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:37,583
I'm not lurking.
I do not lurk.

568
00:26:40,792 --> 00:26:44,041
About the--
this whole Troy hagen thing...

569
00:26:44,083 --> 00:26:45,583
I don't wanna
talk about him.

570
00:26:49,959 --> 00:26:51,041
What, Addison?

571
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:58,041
Why did you quit
doing heart surgery before?

572
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:00,792
Why?
I'm not discussing that.

573
00:27:00,834 --> 00:27:02,083
Sam.
Just leave it alone.

574
00:27:02,125 --> 00:27:03,875
No.

575
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:08,458
That patient, that pedophile,

576
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,333
and now Troy hagen.

577
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:12,500
Just shut up, please?

578
00:27:12,542 --> 00:27:14,500
Shut up.

579
00:27:16,792 --> 00:27:19,125
What did you do, Sam?

580
00:27:23,417 --> 00:27:27,542
Doctors choose to do nothing
all the time.

581
00:27:27,583 --> 00:27:29,792
You know it, I know it.

582
00:27:31,166 --> 00:27:33,333
It's the dirty little secret
of surgery.

583
00:27:33,375 --> 00:27:36,041
Doctors choose to do nothing.

584
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:38,250
Wait. When the patient
is brain-dead

585
00:27:38,291 --> 00:27:40,041
or is gonna suffer
or is too far gone--

586
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:43,000
doctors choose to do nothing.

587
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:48,375
They choose to do nothing
for the right reasons, Sam.

588
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:52,709
Tell me. It's okay.
Just--

589
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,625
what did you do?

590
00:28:11,583 --> 00:28:14,542
Okay, he's off bypass.

591
00:28:15,792 --> 00:28:18,000
He's in fib. Lost his pulse.

592
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:25,000
Dr. Bennett?

593
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,250
Sam: Starting cardiac massage.
He's still in fib.

594
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:31,250
Internal paddles ready.

595
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,583
Dr. Bennett?

596
00:28:35,625 --> 00:28:37,417
No pulse with direct massage.

597
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:39,458
You're losing him.
Should I page Dr. Warren?

598
00:28:41,208 --> 00:28:43,000
Sam:
No.

599
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:49,709
Asystole.

600
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:54,750
Dr. Bennett?
Internal paddles ready.

601
00:28:58,875 --> 00:29:01,792
It's over. We should stop.

602
00:29:01,834 --> 00:29:03,709
But--
we should stop.

603
00:29:08,417 --> 00:29:10,625
Sam:
Time of death, 20:13.

604
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:21,458
Woman:
Dr. Mendville, 8662.
Dr. Mendville--

605
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,125
what the hell happened in there?
Keep your voice down.

606
00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:27,667
Sam-- Sam, tell me.
I made a judgment call.

607
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,041
I made a call.
It was a bad call.

608
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:35,208
You don't know that.
Not for sure.

609
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:38,041
Nobody knows that.
You know that.

610
00:29:40,542 --> 00:29:44,083
Look me in the eye.
Tell me that you didn't just--

611
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:47,542
Addison, I made a call.
Leave it alone.

612
00:29:54,291 --> 00:29:56,041
I'm done.

613
00:29:57,625 --> 00:30:00,041
What--?
I quit.

614
00:30:10,083 --> 00:30:13,792
I let everybody think that
I froze because it was easier,

615
00:30:13,834 --> 00:30:17,041
but I made a choice.

616
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:18,333
You let him die.

617
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,959
You knew.

618
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,583
You knew I let him die.

619
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:27,041
I didn't wanna believe it
and then you quit surgery,

620
00:30:27,083 --> 00:30:30,834
so I guess I just kind of
let it go.

621
00:30:32,083 --> 00:30:34,750
Not everybody
deserves our help.

622
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:37,625
No, not everybody deserves
our respect. But our help?

623
00:30:37,667 --> 00:30:39,625
There's nothing you can say
right now

624
00:30:39,667 --> 00:30:41,583
that's gonna make me feel
any worse than I already do.

625
00:30:41,625 --> 00:30:43,417
Sam.

626
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:45,375
That surgery was 12 years ago.

627
00:30:45,417 --> 00:30:47,291
You're a different--
you're a different man now.

628
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:49,041
No, it doesn't matter.
Yeah, it does matter.

629
00:30:49,083 --> 00:30:52,500
It matters for you, for us.

630
00:30:52,542 --> 00:30:54,917
And hagen, look, somebody else
is gonna do that surgery.

631
00:30:54,959 --> 00:30:57,041
And whatever happens,
it's not on you.

632
00:30:57,083 --> 00:30:59,000
No, it's all on me.

633
00:31:00,667 --> 00:31:04,750
I'm just asking you
to talk to hagen.

634
00:31:06,083 --> 00:31:08,625
Murderer to murderer?

635
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:19,834
Pete:
What happened?

636
00:31:19,875 --> 00:31:21,542
Girl took three bullets
to the abdomen.

637
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:23,750
We were sitting in the car
and, uh, these guys pulled up

638
00:31:23,792 --> 00:31:27,417
and I told her to get down.
The bullets were for me.

639
00:31:27,458 --> 00:31:29,583
I get control of one bleeder,
two more open up.

640
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:31,041
She's bleeding faster
than I can fix them.

641
00:31:31,083 --> 00:31:34,375
You can save her, right?
I mean, you gotta save her.

642
00:31:34,417 --> 00:31:35,792
We've gotta call an ambulance.

643
00:31:35,834 --> 00:31:37,041
No,
that wasn't part of the deal.

644
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:39,041
What? Deal? Deal?

645
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:41,709
Gibby:
Alex and his friends pay me
some money from time to time.

646
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,250
You're taking money
from gangbangers?

647
00:31:43,291 --> 00:31:44,583
Keeps the office going.

648
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:46,500
Would you hand me
a 3.0 vicryl on a driver?

649
00:31:46,542 --> 00:31:48,041
So you look the other way
with criminals

650
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:49,667
because they're the ones
that can pay?

651
00:31:49,709 --> 00:31:50,875
Gibby:
For every Alex who can pay,

652
00:31:50,917 --> 00:31:52,583
I can treat a hundred patients
who can't.

653
00:31:52,625 --> 00:31:54,041
Don't tell me I'm doing
something wrong.

654
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:56,041
You're risking peoples' lives.
Now ours.

655
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:57,625
We used to do that
all the time.

656
00:31:57,667 --> 00:31:58,875
Back then you didn't
cry about it.

657
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,875
Well, back then we didn't have
a choice. Now we do.

658
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:04,083
Her pressure's dropping.

659
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:05,709
She needs blood,
platelets, ffp.

660
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,333
Do something.
Gibby: I don't have access.

661
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:09,208
That's why she needs to be
in a hospital.

662
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:11,583
We can cross-clamp her aorta.
Try to maintain cns function.

663
00:32:13,959 --> 00:32:15,917
Alex: Put down the phone.
Listen to me.

664
00:32:15,959 --> 00:32:17,500
Your girlfriend has
about five minutes

665
00:32:17,542 --> 00:32:19,333
before she bleeds out
on that table.

666
00:32:19,375 --> 00:32:21,041
And there is nothing, nothing,

667
00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:22,750
that we can do here
to change that.

668
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:29,000
Put down the gun.
Let me save her life.

669
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:40,625
Yeah,
I've got a teenaged female.

670
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,959
Multiple gunshot wounds.
I need an ambulance.

671
00:32:51,041 --> 00:32:53,542
Hey, I was just coming
to find you.

672
00:32:53,583 --> 00:32:56,166
I talked to Sam--
"you're selfish, Addison.

673
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:57,792
"You always have been.

674
00:32:57,834 --> 00:33:00,333
"The tunnel vision
that makes you a great surgeon

675
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:02,333
also makes you a crappy friend."

676
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:03,750
What--?
Please let me finish.

677
00:33:03,792 --> 00:33:04,959
Sheldon told me to do this.

678
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,750
Just please.
I just-- let me finish.

679
00:33:06,792 --> 00:33:10,667
"You're a cheater. And while Sam
and I aren't married anymore,

680
00:33:10,709 --> 00:33:12,375
"you knew what you were doing
was wrong,

681
00:33:12,417 --> 00:33:13,959
"and so you lied to me.

682
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,625
"Every day, you didn't tell me
about the two of you, you lied.

683
00:33:17,667 --> 00:33:22,917
"Because you knew
telling the truth would be hard.

684
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:26,500
"And you're a coward.
You're my best friend,

685
00:33:26,542 --> 00:33:29,041
"but when I look at you now,

686
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:31,625
I just wanna slap you
across the face."

687
00:33:41,375 --> 00:33:43,500
Okay, I'm finished.

688
00:33:43,542 --> 00:33:45,125
You sure?
I think so.

689
00:33:45,166 --> 00:33:47,208
Feel better?
Kind of.

690
00:33:56,458 --> 00:33:59,875
You wanna know why Sam
quit surgery 12 years ago?

691
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:03,750
He let a pedophile die
on his table.

692
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:06,041
What? I--

693
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:07,583
he made a decision

694
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:09,583
and it's been eating away
at him ever since.

695
00:34:09,625 --> 00:34:13,458
And seeing Troy hagen, it just
brought it all back for him.

696
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,250
Nai, I know you're mad at me.

697
00:34:16,291 --> 00:34:18,083
I know that we are--

698
00:34:19,709 --> 00:34:20,792
I can't help him.

699
00:34:22,667 --> 00:34:24,083
He needs you.

700
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:42,458
I see it on your face when
you're here. You feel it.

701
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,375
That thing.
The reason we help people.

702
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:46,917
That girl would have died
on your table.

703
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:48,667
Maybe. Maybe not.

704
00:34:48,709 --> 00:34:51,250
But now everything I've built,
they're gonna take it away.

705
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:52,542
Because you went too far.

706
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,750
You disappoint me.

707
00:34:58,792 --> 00:35:00,041
I've got nothing
to prove to you.

708
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:01,834
And if I hear
about another clinic,

709
00:35:01,875 --> 00:35:03,667
if I find out that you treat
another patient,

710
00:35:03,709 --> 00:35:06,250
I will personally call the cops
and shut you down.

711
00:35:18,792 --> 00:35:20,500
Sam.

712
00:35:20,542 --> 00:35:22,083
Hey.

713
00:35:22,125 --> 00:35:24,542
I talked to Addison.
She told me.

714
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:27,458
She told you what?
I know what happened.

715
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,667
Hmm?

716
00:35:29,709 --> 00:35:31,291
I know.

717
00:35:36,375 --> 00:35:39,208
Sam.

718
00:35:40,625 --> 00:35:41,875
Sam. Look at me.

719
00:35:41,917 --> 00:35:43,750
I am.
Please, just look at me.

720
00:35:43,792 --> 00:35:46,125
I am.

721
00:35:46,166 --> 00:35:48,667
I understand.
No, you can't.

722
00:35:48,709 --> 00:35:50,333
No, Sam, I do.

723
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:51,709
But you should've told me.

724
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:54,792
Because after that,
everything changed.

725
00:35:54,834 --> 00:35:57,583
Maybe not all at once, but--

726
00:35:57,625 --> 00:35:59,542
but just enough.

727
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:02,000
Yeah.

728
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:06,959
Well, I'm sorry. Ahem.

729
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,041
I know.

730
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,959
I don't know
if that matters anymore.

731
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,208
Oh, it matters.

732
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:15,041
It matters to have someone
to listen to you

733
00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:18,959
and try to understand.

734
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,208
It matters.

735
00:36:26,375 --> 00:36:28,166
Sorry.

736
00:36:37,917 --> 00:36:41,500
You okay?
Yeah.

737
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,792
Violet:
You miss it.

738
00:36:44,834 --> 00:36:47,625
Doctors without borders.

739
00:36:47,667 --> 00:36:49,000
The adrenaline.

740
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:54,250
Yeah.

741
00:36:54,291 --> 00:36:56,750
Listen, I've been thinking
about trying to pick up

742
00:36:56,792 --> 00:36:58,250
some emergency-room shifts.

743
00:36:58,291 --> 00:36:59,667
Get back to critical care.

744
00:36:59,709 --> 00:37:05,000
If we can make it work
with your schedule and Lucas.

745
00:37:05,041 --> 00:37:06,375
We'll make it work.

746
00:37:25,208 --> 00:37:28,458
I know you don't wanna hear
an apology.

747
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:31,834
No. I don't.

748
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,667
Whatever I say--

749
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:34,959
it's not gonna change anything.

750
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:39,750
Have the surgery.

751
00:37:41,291 --> 00:37:43,709
Live.

752
00:37:46,166 --> 00:37:48,041
And do better next time.

753
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:50,000
What, that's it?

754
00:37:52,667 --> 00:37:55,083
That's all any of us can do.

755
00:37:58,375 --> 00:38:01,500
Should I be worried about
what just happened in there?

756
00:38:01,542 --> 00:38:04,041
Hagen's gonna have
the surgery.

757
00:38:04,083 --> 00:38:06,083
Thank you.

758
00:38:06,125 --> 00:38:08,834
Oh, uh...

759
00:38:08,875 --> 00:38:11,041
Tell Campbell to take another
look at the films.

760
00:38:11,083 --> 00:38:13,208
The patient has
a pseudo-aneurysm.

761
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,542
If Campbell didn't see it,

762
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:17,166
hagen would have died
on the table.

763
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:33,542
Hey.
You got a busy day tomorrow?

764
00:38:33,583 --> 00:38:35,166
Not really.

765
00:38:35,208 --> 00:38:39,583
Good. Because I had the realtor
set up some appointments, so...

766
00:38:39,625 --> 00:38:42,041
Why? You tattled to Violet
about our fight

767
00:38:42,083 --> 00:38:43,291
and she told you
to make nice?

768
00:38:43,333 --> 00:38:45,041
No.

769
00:38:45,083 --> 00:38:49,000
If you're unhappy here,
we'll move.

770
00:38:50,375 --> 00:38:52,041
But the truth is,
I don't see what you see.

771
00:38:52,083 --> 00:38:54,041
Every time I walk through
that door with you,

772
00:38:54,083 --> 00:38:56,542
I remember the first time
I brought you here

773
00:38:56,583 --> 00:38:57,959
and how excited I was.

774
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,834
And the bedroom, it doesn't
remind me of makeup casseroles

775
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:02,625
and catsuit tug of wars.

776
00:39:02,667 --> 00:39:06,000
It reminds me
of the first time we had sex.

777
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:09,583
And for me,
now that you're here,

778
00:39:09,625 --> 00:39:13,542
everything just feels right.

779
00:39:17,125 --> 00:39:19,750
How about we make a new memory?

780
00:39:19,792 --> 00:39:23,041
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.

781
00:39:23,083 --> 00:39:24,792
Mm-hm.

782
00:39:35,041 --> 00:39:36,709
Hey.

783
00:39:38,917 --> 00:39:41,959
So Sam convinced hagen
to have the surgery.

784
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,667
I heard.

785
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Thank you.
I'm gonna be out of the office

786
00:39:47,041 --> 00:39:48,834
for a few weeks
on foundation business.

787
00:39:48,875 --> 00:39:52,166
Can, uh, can you ask Sam
to check in

788
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:54,041
on Maya and Olivia for me
while I'm gone?

789
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:56,250
Sure.
Okay.

790
00:39:58,834 --> 00:40:03,750
Nai, are we ever gonna be
friends the way we were?

791
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:08,375
You know that night,

792
00:40:08,417 --> 00:40:11,041
the night he quit surgery?

793
00:40:11,083 --> 00:40:12,458
He didn't tell me
what happened.

794
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:16,417
We had never had secrets
before that.

795
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:19,959
That was the beginning
of the end of us.

796
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,000
I'm sorry.

797
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:26,709
Take care of him.

798
00:40:32,166 --> 00:40:35,083
Addie.
Yeah?

799
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:39,333
This isn't the beginning
of the end of you and me.

800
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:58,291
Hey.

801
00:40:58,333 --> 00:41:00,667
God, you're much later
than I thought.

802
00:41:02,625 --> 00:41:04,542
Yeah.

803
00:41:07,542 --> 00:41:09,000
I had a nice dinner
with Derek.

804
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,208
That's good.
How did the surgery go?

805
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:21,959
I lost the patient.
Oh, Sam.

806
00:41:22,041 --> 00:41:24,333
I'm sorry.

807
00:41:24,375 --> 00:41:25,583
Come here.

808
00:41:25,625 --> 00:41:26,875
I'm okay.
I'm gonna go take a shower.

809
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:29,917
Come here. Come here.

810
00:41:32,542 --> 00:41:34,542
This wasn't your fault.
I know.

811
00:41:34,583 --> 00:41:36,792
Okay? You hear me?
Mm-hm.

812
00:41:36,834 --> 00:41:38,125
It was not your fault.

813
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:42,583
I'm sorry.

814
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:01,917
Am I a good man?

815
00:42:11,083 --> 00:42:13,000
Yes.
