1
00:00:03,291 --> 00:00:05,083
â™ª Ohhh ohhh ohhh â™ª

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,959
Oh, what about peonies?
Peonies could be good.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,583
I have no idea.

4
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:12,583
It's your mother's wedding,
and you don't know

5
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:15,583
what kind of flowers
she wants?
Bizzy made it abundantly clear

6
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:17,583
that this wedding
is for Susan.

7
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:20,542
Okay. Then what would
Susan want?
Again, I have no idea.

8
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:23,375
Ugh. You're being petulant.
Well, I am entitled, Nai.

9
00:00:23,417 --> 00:00:25,583
I am throwing a wedding
for my mother

10
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:28,458
and her...
Lesbian mistress/lover.

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,959
My mother. Okay?

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,375
Who, by the way,
never thanked me

13
00:00:32,417 --> 00:00:35,250
for saving the life of her
lesbian mistress/lover.
I told you, if you want
something from that woman,

14
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,250
you have to ask her for it.
All right. How about this?

15
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:39,750
"Bizzy, stop being a lesbian
and go back to your husband.

16
00:00:39,792 --> 00:00:42,208
"Stay in the closet--
your very large,

17
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,959
well-decorated closet."
Homophobe.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,583
I know, right? But only
when it comes to her.

19
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:49,750
I mean, if it were you,
if you wanted to marry

20
00:00:49,792 --> 00:00:52,750
your lesbian mistress/lover,
I would throw you a parade.

21
00:00:52,792 --> 00:00:55,500
I would march on the capital
until it was legal.

22
00:00:55,542 --> 00:00:58,291
But with her, I mean, what--
what is wrong with me?

23
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:00,291
Why am I being like this?
Well, she's your mommy.

24
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:04,041
My mommy? Mommies are warm.
My nanny was warm, but she...

25
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:06,041
She's my bizzy.

26
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:08,417
Which is exactly
why you are being like this.

27
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:11,417
Look, you always thought that
she was cold and hard,

28
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:13,875
and she's about to do something
warm and wonderful.

29
00:01:13,917 --> 00:01:16,166
She's about to pledge
her love...

30
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:18,792
Which means you might actually
be wrong about her,

31
00:01:18,834 --> 00:01:21,458
which means she might
actually be your mommy.

32
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,875
All right, Susan--
she likes understated elegance.

33
00:01:25,917 --> 00:01:30,083
Okay. Then let's find
an understated, elegant flower.

34
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:32,083
You came.

35
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,917
You saw me.
Now cross it off your list.

36
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:36,542
I'll see you in six months.

37
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:38,542
See?
I can't deal with this.

38
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:40,542
Lisa, Lisa,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

39
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:43,041
He drinks cognac like
it's water, he only wears

40
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:45,917
that stupid track suit that
I bought him 20 years ago,

41
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:48,667
and he sounds like he's ready
for the tubercular ward.

42
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:51,083
But if he doesn't give a damn,
then why should I?

43
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:53,083
Well, why don't you
bring someone in

44
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:54,709
to help out around here?

45
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,041
Oh, he's got someone. Simone.
She's hiding in the bedroom

46
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:59,750
because she knows
how much I detest her.

47
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:01,875
She doesn't help.
She indulges him.

48
00:02:01,917 --> 00:02:04,583
I miss my mom.

49
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,291
Yeah. She was, uh,
an amazing lady.

50
00:02:08,792 --> 00:02:12,166
I'm sorry. I have to go.

51
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:16,041
You know how you can tell
if a politician is lying?

52
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:18,041
His lips are moving.

53
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,041
You know what
that sound is?

54
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,667
Too many cigars
and too few walks.

55
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:28,458
Go drum up business
somewhere else, smart guy.

56
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,667
This place is filled
with veiny old biddies

57
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:33,834
who would love
your attention.
Why don't you listen to me?

58
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:37,750
You knew esty.

59
00:02:37,792 --> 00:02:41,709
Without her, what have I got
to look forward to?

60
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,291
Hey.

61
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:46,583
Hey, enough with the zipping
and zapping. I'm hungry.

62
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,625
Oh, hi.

63
00:02:48,667 --> 00:02:50,834
Hi.
Oh, Simone,
this is, uh, Sam Bennett.

64
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:54,208
He was esty's doctor,
and now he's a pain in my ass.

65
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,750
I was gonna grab Abe
some lunch.

66
00:02:56,792 --> 00:02:59,291
Can I get you anything?
No. No, thank you.

67
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,041
Uh, go to langler's,
all right?

68
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:03,834
It's the best pastrami in L.A.
now that my deli is closed.

69
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:06,542
But that's like being
the world's tallest midget,

70
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:09,792
but still--
w-why don't I buy us all
something a little more healthy,

71
00:03:09,834 --> 00:03:12,041
uh, like, uh,
Turkey sandwiches?

72
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm running low. Uh, uh,
get me a couple of bottles of--

73
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:17,583
milk.
Yeah.

74
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,000
Got it, handsome.

75
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:26,250
You know,
she's not helping you.
Sure she is.

76
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,667
You know how long
it would take me

77
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,583
to shuffle over to
the liquor store and back?
At least let Simone bring you
up to my office.

78
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,750
Let me see what's going on
with that cough.

79
00:03:33,792 --> 00:03:36,583
Thanks for visiting.

80
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,834
I was raped...

81
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,250
In my office.

82
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:48,125
Physical pain
was gone in a week.

83
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:52,834
The feelings...

84
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:55,500
I get scared sometimes.

85
00:03:55,542 --> 00:03:58,625
And I get sad.

86
00:03:58,667 --> 00:04:02,083
The days feel longer
than they should.

87
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,625
And I'm having trouble
sleeping.

88
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:06,834
You're depressed.

89
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:09,834
I said I get sad.
Okay.

90
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,709
I can't, uh...

91
00:04:16,667 --> 00:04:18,500
Cooper's wonderful.

92
00:04:18,542 --> 00:04:20,834
He's the best.

93
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:23,500
But I can't, uh...

94
00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:25,625
I try,
but I can't have sex.

95
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:26,542
Mm.

96
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,333
Every time we try,

97
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,333
I get this picture
in my head.

98
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,375
I'm lying on the floor...

99
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,834
And that man's on top of me,

100
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,083
but I'm not watching
from below.

101
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,041
I'm above him...

102
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,542
Like a spectator
to my own rape.

103
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,041
Why do you think that is?

104
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:50,583
Why do you think
that is?

105
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:53,166
There it is.
Psychobabble.

106
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,041
Ask a question.
Get a question back.

107
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,667
Whole thing's ridiculous.

108
00:04:56,709 --> 00:04:58,667
I told Cooper
this was a bad idea.

109
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:00,667
And can I be honest with you?

110
00:05:00,709 --> 00:05:04,083
I don't want you in my head.
I don't need you in my head.

111
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,458
I agree. Talk therapy--

112
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,500
it won't help.

113
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:11,750
I'm...

114
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:14,333
Prescribing
a cocktail of drugs.

115
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,333
A combination
of antidepressants,

116
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,166
mood stabilizers,

117
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:21,542
some tranquilizers,
just to take the edge off.

118
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:24,041
Now your mood, your sleep,
your energy,

119
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,000
it'll get better.

120
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:29,041
Now I've written
four refills,

121
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,750
so you're good
for five months.

122
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:45,041
Good luck.

123
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,333
Lungs are clear.

124
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,208
Vitals look good.

125
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,291
Did you ask him?

126
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:54,041
I didn't want to impose.

127
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,208
Ask me what?

128
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,458
Our wedding--we would
love for you to come.

129
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,041
Imposing. You're imposing.
Oh, not at all.
It would be an honor.

130
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:05,667
I'll be back later, and i'm
looking forward to a dance.

131
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:13,458
I think he has a thing for you.
 I'm with Sam.

132
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,625
For now.

133
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:18,375
Dr. Rodriguez is from
a prominent family

134
00:06:18,417 --> 00:06:21,375
in South America--
very wealthy.
I'll keep that in mind,
bizzy.

135
00:06:21,417 --> 00:06:25,041
I'm simply saying that it's
as easy to fall--
I love Sam.

136
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,375
You don't choose
who you love.

137
00:06:27,417 --> 00:06:29,125
Right, ladies?

138
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:34,041
You should see
how he's living, Nai.

139
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,417
The girl who's taking care
of him doesn't clean,

140
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,583
lets him drink, eat,
smoke all day.
Well, so tell his daughter.

141
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,875
She was there.
I walked in on them fighting.

142
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:42,834
He doesn't listen
to her either.

143
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,792
I thought they had a better
relationship than that.

144
00:06:44,834 --> 00:06:47,041
You remember how we used
to think of him as a--

145
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,625
as a charming curmudgeon?

146
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:51,834
Well--
now he's just a curmudgeon?

147
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,834
Yes.
Oh, well, maybe he's happy
like that,

148
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,375
or his version of happy.

149
00:06:55,417 --> 00:06:57,417
No. He deserves to be
taken care of.

150
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:00,542
Sam, it's wonderful that you
still care about Abe.

151
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:03,875
But what Abe wants to do
with the time he has left,

152
00:07:03,917 --> 00:07:05,959
that's his business.

153
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,500
Hey, what's going on
with Violet?

154
00:07:08,542 --> 00:07:11,500
I mean, is she too cool
to call me or what?
She just has all these
meetings with her publisher.

155
00:07:11,542 --> 00:07:14,917
- Your friend Larry's in the wrong line of work.
- What do you mean?

156
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:17,709
He's a pharmacist
not a therapist.
Who's Larry?

157
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,250
Dr. Larry Cannon--

158
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,500
my best friend
and a brilliant psychiatrist.

159
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:24,208
You have a best friend?
What are you, 12?

160
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,667
Yeah. Mm.

161
00:07:26,709 --> 00:07:28,709
You're seeing a shrink?
Good for you.

162
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,625
Not good. All he tried to do
was push drugs on me.

163
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:34,458
Wait. What do you mean?
Did you try talking to him--

164
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,959
you think I hauled my ass
across town to sit in silence?

165
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,250
I tried.
He wasn't interested.
There's enough drugs there
to paralyze an elephant.

166
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,458
Oh, this makes no sense.
Larry isn't a pill guy.

167
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,166
He pioneered
narrative talk therapy.

168
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:46,041
He taught it to me.
It's the basis of my practice.
Narrative--

169
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:49,667
that's using the story
of people's lives, right?
Larry wasn't interested
in my stories.

170
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:51,750
He just wanted to write me
a scrip.

171
00:07:51,792 --> 00:07:54,500
Maybe he thought you needed
to be stabilized

172
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:56,750
before you started talking.

173
00:07:58,417 --> 00:08:00,083
That sounded bad, right?

174
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,041
Yeah, it did.

175
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,041
Charlotte, I'm sorry.

176
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,542
Look, Larry's been traveling
a lot, and, uh,

177
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,959
I don't know what's going on,
but I'll talk to him.

178
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,583
I'll explain you weren't
looking for pills.

179
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:13,625
But you can't give up
after only one session.

180
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:15,041
I can, and I will.

181
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,542
Dr. Dyson,
dial the page operator.

182
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:22,625
Dr. Dyson,
dial the page operator.

183
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:25,041
Y-You know you really
don't have to come

184
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,500
to their wedding.

185
00:08:26,542 --> 00:08:28,250
I like weddings.

186
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,125
Susan goes
in the "win" column.

187
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:34,750
That's always
worth celebrating.

188
00:08:34,792 --> 00:08:39,375
You know, I'm not sure
I ever said--
I was just doing my job.

189
00:08:39,417 --> 00:08:42,625
It was important to me,
and you were willing to try.

190
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:45,667
I'm not sure
I could say no to you.

191
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:47,667
Okay.
I'm with Sam.
Mm-hmm.

192
00:08:47,709 --> 00:08:49,875
You know I'm with Sam.
You have to stop.

193
00:08:49,917 --> 00:08:51,375
I am not interested.

194
00:08:51,417 --> 00:08:53,041
Well, if that were true,

195
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:56,333
you wouldn't care
that I flirt with you.
Okay.

196
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:59,208
You are not hearing me,
and i--

197
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,166
I need to go.

198
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:15,250
You do realize that I didn't
even plan my own wedding.

199
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:17,625
Because I did.
You're returning the favor.

200
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:20,625
I get that you want to give
Susan this wedding,

201
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:22,166
but it's...

202
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:25,250
Okay. You know what?
I don't get it.

203
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,208
Based on your sham of a marriage
to the captain,

204
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,625
I mean, you clearly don't
take vows that seriously,

205
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:31,625
and we all know
you're a cheater.

206
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:33,917
Thank you, by the way,
for passing that down.

207
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:36,041
I think we both know that
infidelity is not genetic.

208
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,041
And if we agree
it's learned behavior,

209
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,208
you certainly didn't
learn it from me, dear,

210
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,208
because you had no idea
what I was up to

211
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,458
until long after you'd made
your own mistakes.

212
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,083
It really is time
for you to grow up

213
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:50,208
and accept responsibility.

214
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,041
For the past 20 years,
I've had my proverbial cake--

215
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:55,041
homes, husband,
children, jewels,

216
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,041
ladies auxiliary--

217
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,542
and that whole time,

218
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:01,542
the love of my life waited
patiently in the closet

219
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,500
because that was my way.

220
00:10:03,542 --> 00:10:06,959
I almost lost Susan,
but she's healthy now,

221
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,625
so this time we do it her way,
and she wants a wedding.

222
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:14,083
I'm a lesbian, dear.

223
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,291
Deal with it.

224
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:20,291
I just want
to get a schedule.

225
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,750
Hey. I didn't expect
to see you here.

226
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:25,750
I didn't expect
to cough up a lung,

227
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,750
so there you are.

228
00:10:27,792 --> 00:10:30,583
You want me to examine you?
Uh, no.

229
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:33,667
I just came here for
the "expectant mother" magazine.

230
00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:36,125
Uh, you don't
have to come in.
You sure?

231
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,667
An audience
makes him nervous.

232
00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:40,583
Okay. Uh, right this way.

233
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:42,875
Just tell him
Dr. Wallace called again.

234
00:10:42,917 --> 00:10:45,333
W-a-l--look, just tell him
to call Sheldon

235
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,959
as soon as possible.

236
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:49,458
Yes, thank you.
Do you have any idea
how long it took me

237
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,083
to convince her to go?
We had one shot at this.

238
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,041
Cooper--
no. Charlotte's not like us,
Sheldon.

239
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,041
She doesn't share every feeling
and vocalize every thought.

240
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:58,125
She comes from a family
of mutes.

241
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,291
Her dad never said he loved her.
Her mother denied

242
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,500
she had a drinking problem
until her liver imploded.

243
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:05,000
So for her to be willing
to speak to somebody

244
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:06,959
about the rape--
I know you're upset--

245
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,208
no, no, no, she needs this.
She doesn't sleep.

246
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,750
She's always
looking over her shoulder.

247
00:11:11,792 --> 00:11:13,625
Look, I'm sorry,
but this...

248
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:16,542
This isn't the Larry I know.

249
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:19,333
You said he was the best.
He is the best.

250
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,333
Larry is the reason
I became a therapist.

251
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,333
Okay, watching him
connect to people,

252
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,625
UN-unraveling their problems,
you know, it was inspiring.

253
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:27,792
So what happened?

254
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:31,625
I don't know. I don't know.
But I'm gonna find out.

255
00:11:32,834 --> 00:11:35,041
Okay, so...

256
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:37,041
Hotel's booked.
Flowers are done.

257
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,750
Music...
Do you have the final count
for the caterer?

258
00:11:39,792 --> 00:11:41,750
Oh. Well, bizzy has
no friends here,

259
00:11:41,792 --> 00:11:44,625
and I don't think
Susan has friends.

260
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:48,458
Uh, the captain
is clearly not attending.

261
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,458
Oh, and my brother
e-mailed this morning,

262
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,625
saying that he didn't come
to bizzy's first wedding,

263
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:54,625
so he's not coming
to her second.

264
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:57,542
So I guess...
That just leaves us,

265
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,458
except, um, for Violet
who's in New York, so...

266
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,583
Uh, that's ten.
No, no.

267
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,667
11. Dr. Rodriguez,
he's attending.

268
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:06,583
Why--why did you
invite him?

269
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,709
I didn't. Susan did.
Why? What's the difference?

270
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,041
I don't know. I just--

271
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:14,583
I saw you in the hospital
flirting with him.

272
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,041
N-No.

273
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,500
No, Nai.
He was flirting with me.

274
00:12:18,542 --> 00:12:21,041
I was very uncomfortable.
Nai.

275
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:25,083
All right. He--Dr. Rodriguez
asked me out ages ago.

276
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:28,417
But I told him that I am
in love with Sam.

277
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,625
Well, clearly,
you weren't very convincing.

278
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,625
Okay, Nai, come on.
Stop, all right?

279
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:34,875
I'm already insane enough with
bizzy breathing down my neck.

280
00:12:34,917 --> 00:12:37,125
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I just, uh...

281
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,125
When you told me
about you and Sam,

282
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:42,041
I just didn't think that
you guys were gonna last.

283
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,458
I thought...

284
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,458
Look, um, I'm not bizzy,

285
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,041
and I am not criticizing
or doubting,

286
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:52,083
but your relationship with Sam
is real now.

287
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,542
And...

288
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:57,125
When it gets real,

289
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,583
that's usually
when you screw it up.

290
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:05,041
Well...

291
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,500
Not this time.

292
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,750
Chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease.

293
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,041
Big medical words
don't scare me.

294
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,667
Hey.

295
00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:19,291
The better-looking
Dr. Bennett.
Sam told me you were here.

296
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,959
I just thought I'd come in
and say hi.

297
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,125
Or he dragged you away
from something more important

298
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,583
to play good cop

299
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:28,917
and tell me all the things
that I have to live for.

300
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,917
I'm old,
but I'm not stupid.

301
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,959
Abe, now, our--our only
interest here is helping you.

302
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:35,917
Unless you can raise
the dead...

303
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:38,583
Look, uh, we realize that
we can't replace esty,

304
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:41,500
but we can help you find
somebody better than Simone.

305
00:13:41,542 --> 00:13:44,041
Someone who can cook, clean.
You sound like Lisa.

306
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:47,041
Well, maybe that should
tell you something.
Esty and I...

307
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,375
Simone and I are...

308
00:13:51,417 --> 00:13:53,458
We're doing just fine.

309
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:59,500
Insurance card.
Oh, insurance card. Um--

310
00:13:59,542 --> 00:14:00,792
oh.

311
00:14:00,834 --> 00:14:03,333
Um...
Here you go.

312
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,208
Thanks.

313
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,375
No problem... Mr. Nussbaum.

314
00:14:07,417 --> 00:14:09,375
Um, I actually--he--
I work for him.

315
00:14:09,417 --> 00:14:11,750
And he's, uh, he's older,
an older guy.

316
00:14:11,792 --> 00:14:14,041
He's a patient
of Dr. Bennett.

317
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:16,834
So I can--i can--
I got this. Thanks.

318
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:25,834
So this is why
you never answer your phone.

319
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:29,208
The Chinese have been playing
mah-jongg for a thousand years,

320
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,542
and I just discovered it
a week ago.

321
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,458
How amazing is that, huh?
What's more amazing

322
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,834
is that little drug cocktail
you wrote Dr. King.

323
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,458
Oh. Lovely lady.

324
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,041
Killer smile.

325
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,458
Charlotte's a colleague
and a friend. I sent her to you

326
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,959
because she survived
a traumatic sexual assault,

327
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,041
and you sent her packing
in five minutes.
Not empty-handed.

328
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,834
Since when do you

329
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:52,041
replace talk therapy
with drug protocols?

330
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,709
Sheldon,

331
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,917
they come to us distraught,

332
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,583
emotionally void.

333
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,667
And we listen.
We take it all in,

334
00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:02,667
interpret the data,
and then we respond

335
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:05,458
using whatever experience
we have.

336
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,458
I don't understand.

337
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,458
The cycle repeats itself--

338
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,041
breakthrough, relapse--

339
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:14,834
over and over and over ag--

340
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:17,583
talk therapy is a sham.

341
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:21,959
That's crazy.
We help people.

342
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,709
By sharing our insights?

343
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,875
We're not helping anything.
No.

344
00:15:26,917 --> 00:15:29,041
These guys do.

345
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,542
Sheldon, we are machines.

346
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,083
Everything we do
is controlled

347
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,125
by chemical neurotransmitters
in our brain.

348
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:39,709
Crank up the serotonin,
and we feel euphoric.

349
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,709
Dissipate it,
and we feel depressed.

350
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:45,041
It's not that simple.
Drugs have a place in therapy.

351
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:47,667
But it--
it's not in isolation.

352
00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:50,667
Human interaction is critical.
You...

353
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:54,458
You've spent your entire life
committed to talk therapy.

354
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,917
Yo-you've--

355
00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:58,041
you've helped thousands
of patients.

356
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:01,709
I was wrong.
Everything that I taught you,

357
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,500
everything that you've built
your practice on

358
00:16:04,542 --> 00:16:07,083
is a lie.

359
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:10,250
Is black wrong?

360
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,500
I mean, it's a wedding,
not a funeral.

361
00:16:12,542 --> 00:16:15,333
You know, but it is L.A.
what would you want
yours to be like?

362
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:18,750
My what?
Your second wedding. What would
you want it to be like?

363
00:16:18,792 --> 00:16:21,417
I don't know.

364
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,959
Okay, I have to
tell you something.

365
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,959
Not because it's important,
but because...

366
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,500
I don't want you to hear it
from somebody else

367
00:16:30,542 --> 00:16:31,959
and misunderstand.

368
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Do I want to hear this?

369
00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:40,000
Eric Rodriguez
flirted with me.

370
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,750
He's been flirting
with me.

371
00:16:42,792 --> 00:16:44,750
But I did not flirt back.

372
00:16:44,792 --> 00:16:47,041
Well, what does that mean?

373
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:49,625
I don't know.
I don't know. I just...

374
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:51,667
I just thought
that you should know.

375
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,750
And now I do.

376
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,625
She had probably
a dozen credit cards

377
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:07,625
with your dad's name
on 'em.

378
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:09,625
Why am I not surprised?

379
00:17:09,667 --> 00:17:11,625
You think your dad
has any idea?

380
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:15,125
Even if he knew, he wouldn't
care. She's pretty and flirty.

381
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:18,000
You think that matters to him?
Well, he's still
a man, Naomi.

382
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,583
After my mom died,
he became a different person.

383
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,583
It's like,
the more help he needs,

384
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,000
the farther away
he pushes me.

385
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:28,000
And to settle
for that Simone...
Well, she's not taking
good care of your dad,

386
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:30,667
and now with the credit cards,
you should get rid of her.

387
00:17:30,709 --> 00:17:34,041
And then what? He can't
be alone. He needs help.

388
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,917
We'll help you find
someone else.
Do you want to talk
to Simone,

389
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:40,041
or should I?
Can you just tell her

390
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,041
to stop what she's doing
and try harder?

391
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:45,166
Lisa--
please.
I can't deal with him.

392
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,500
But someone has to.

393
00:17:47,542 --> 00:17:50,583
Did you say anything
to upset him?
You're not really
blaming her?

394
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:54,041
No. No, it's just, maybe
he felt that talk therapy

395
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:56,041
would be ineffective
in this specific case.

396
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:59,375
Talk therapy is ineffective.

397
00:17:59,417 --> 00:18:02,083
Are you and Larry working
for the same drug company?
What is the point

398
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,500
of sitting on a couch
and blabbing back and forth

399
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,542
when emotions
are controlled by chemicals?

400
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:08,458
When your car is out of gas,

401
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,667
you don't whisper in the tank
to get it moving.

402
00:18:10,709 --> 00:18:13,542
Talk therapy has 70 years
of empirical studies

403
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:16,041
backing its effectiveness.
But what you do
in a year of therapy

404
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,625
can be accomplished in a day
with a little yellow pill.
Talking
doesn't have side effects,

405
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:21,542
risk of dependency,
negative interactions.

406
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:24,458
You of all people
should know that.
Well, maybe he was
trying something new.

407
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,041
I mean, he wouldn't be
the first doctor

408
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:30,458
to have a change of heart.
A change of heart I get.

409
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,625
But a complete 180
after 25 years?
What did he say
when you confronted him?

410
00:18:33,667 --> 00:18:35,041
He shut me down.
And?

411
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:38,667
You let him get away
with that?

412
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:46,667
Susan?

413
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:49,250
W--where'd she go?

414
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:51,250
I discharged her
an hour ago.

415
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,375
She said she and your mother

416
00:18:53,417 --> 00:18:57,208
were checking in
to the four seasons.
Well, no one called me.

417
00:18:59,917 --> 00:19:03,041
Where are you rushing off to?

418
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,041
I make you uncomfortable.

419
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:06,083
No.

420
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:09,750
W-Well, ye--
okay, yes, you do.

421
00:19:09,792 --> 00:19:12,542
I'm in love with Sam.
So you keep saying.

422
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:15,625
He's your friend.
Doesn't that bother you?
Does it bother you?

423
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:17,500
Yes.
Shame.

424
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,333
I'm sorry.

425
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,041
No, don't be sorry.

426
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:33,333
I'm fine.

427
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:36,542
I thought the therapy
might help.

428
00:19:38,542 --> 00:19:41,041
Why did he have to be
a kook?

429
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:44,041
Char, it's okay.

430
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,041
I'm fine.

431
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,375
It's fine with me.

432
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,000
What if...

433
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:58,667
What if I'm never ready?

434
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:07,542
Don't think about it.
Don't worry about it.

435
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,625
When it's right,
you'll know.

436
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:14,667
I can wait.

437
00:20:14,709 --> 00:20:16,750
You can't wait.

438
00:20:16,792 --> 00:20:18,583
I can.

439
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,625
And until you're ready...

440
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:22,041
I...

441
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,792
Have this.

442
00:20:23,834 --> 00:20:25,291
Yeah.

443
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,917
Hey.
Hey.

444
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:45,041
What are you doing over here?
Just a change of pace.

445
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,291
Huh. Well...
Dinner for one?

446
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:50,041
Yeah. Well, I figured
you'd, uh, you'd be late.

447
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:53,458
Since I haven't seen you
all day, and you didn't call,

448
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,667
it might be more accurate
to say

449
00:20:55,709 --> 00:20:58,542
you guessed
that I would be late.

450
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:02,083
Or... you hoped
I would be late?

451
00:21:05,667 --> 00:21:08,041
Listen, um...

452
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,500
You asked me
last night about...

453
00:21:10,542 --> 00:21:14,417
My second wedding.
Yeah. That, uh, I didn't
mean anything by that.

454
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:17,041
That w--you were planning
a wedding, and I was just--

455
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,750
it was just--i was just asking
a question. I just wanted to--

456
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:21,542
well, I thought about it.

457
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:24,041
Whoa. Okay. Answer.

458
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,667
Should we?

459
00:21:26,709 --> 00:21:29,125
Should we get married?

460
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,166
Let's get married.
Wait. Okay, wait.

461
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:33,959
No, don't answer now.

462
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,375
Is this coming off
the Eric thing

463
00:21:36,417 --> 00:21:38,667
and the--and the--
and the flirting--

464
00:21:38,709 --> 00:21:41,500
no. You are my best friend.
I love what we have together.

465
00:21:41,542 --> 00:21:43,583
Just think about it.

466
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,959
Okay?

467
00:21:47,834 --> 00:21:51,583
You've turned your back
on talk therapy.

468
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:54,583
It's everything you ever
stood for and believed in.

469
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:57,291
And now you're...

470
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:59,250
How can you just walk away?

471
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:02,333
It's simple. All these years,
I've been wrong, Sheldon.

472
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,959
But I finally figured it out,
and I'm content.

473
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,542
I like the new me.

474
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:08,041
The pills...

475
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:10,000
Have helped me let go

476
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:13,375
of some dark emotions that were
kicking around upstairs.

477
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,750
Larry, what the hell
are you doing?

478
00:22:17,792 --> 00:22:19,792
Do you even know
what you're taking?

479
00:22:19,834 --> 00:22:22,917
I'm a doctor, remember?

480
00:22:22,959 --> 00:22:25,041
Mm. Finally,
you're seeing the light.

481
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:28,041
You're not getting these back.
Give me those.

482
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:30,041
Hey, now don't get greedy,
shelley.

483
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:32,709
There's something
very wrong with you.

484
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,542
I am ten times the shrink
that you are.

485
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:36,542
I am fully qualified
to make a diagnosis.

486
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:38,375
Not on yourself.

487
00:22:38,417 --> 00:22:41,041
You honestly think
that you are equipped

488
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:42,959
to evaluate me?

489
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,959
I have an I.Q. Of 170.

490
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,333
I have 53 published papers.

491
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:52,166
I have written six books.

492
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:53,959
What have you ever done?!

493
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,208
Huh?!

494
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:59,750
Please let me help you.
We can talk about--

495
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:03,333
no talking! No therapy!

496
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:06,041
You don't know what I know

497
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:08,709
so you can't see it,
but I can.

498
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,583
See, I know!

499
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:12,041
Tell him!

500
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:14,625
Tell him to listen!
He won't listen!

501
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:17,166
He just keeps talking!

502
00:23:33,959 --> 00:23:36,417
Okay. You're friends
with Addison.

503
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:39,166
You're like a little sister
to her. You--you know her.

504
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:41,208
Are you accusing me
of something

505
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,500
or asking me something?
Addison proposed.

506
00:23:43,542 --> 00:23:45,250
Wow. I-I...

507
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,875
Yeah.
Didn't see that coming.

508
00:23:47,917 --> 00:23:50,208
Uh... well, congratulations.

509
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:53,875
Do you think she's crazy?
I guess I should take back
my congratulations.

510
00:23:53,917 --> 00:23:57,125
I'm not even sure she meant it.
Like, maybe she didn't mean it.

511
00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:59,208
But what if she did?
Wait. You didn't answer her?

512
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,291
Last week,
she wanted to have a baby.

513
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:03,834
This week,
she wants to get married.
No, wait. Stop. Back up.

514
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,834
Addison proposed,
you didn't answer her,

515
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:08,917
and now you're here asking me
if I think she's crazy?

516
00:24:08,959 --> 00:24:12,333
You guys look so happy.
What--what is the problem?
I ju--no, we are happy.

517
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:15,375
I-I ju--i don't know
if there is a problem exactly,

518
00:24:15,417 --> 00:24:18,333
but... I know
that this ain't right.

519
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:21,125
Okay.

520
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:22,875
So--

521
00:24:22,917 --> 00:24:24,375
so...

522
00:24:24,417 --> 00:24:27,208
How do I let her down easy?

523
00:24:34,542 --> 00:24:36,959
Hey, Sheldon.

524
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,250
You don't look so good.
Everything okay?

525
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:43,542
No, Cooper.
Everything is not okay.

526
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:45,542
Look, I'm sorry.
It's just...

527
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:48,041
I spent the whole night
looking for Larry.

528
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:51,500
Went to his office, went to
his house--he wasn't there.

529
00:24:51,542 --> 00:24:54,208
Something happen?
We were having dinner
in a restaurant,

530
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,834
and he--he just went...

531
00:24:55,875 --> 00:24:57,333
Cuckoo?

532
00:24:57,375 --> 00:25:00,041
The proper term
is a psychotic break.

533
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:01,458
Is he dangerous?

534
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,792
Should you call
the police?

535
00:25:03,834 --> 00:25:06,583
I was hoping
not to get them involved.

536
00:25:06,625 --> 00:25:09,375
Sheldon, the man's
treating patients.
Or supposed to be,
anyway.

537
00:25:09,417 --> 00:25:12,041
Do you have a choice?

538
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:16,709
I got a message
you wanted to see me.

539
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,417
Is it about Abe's cough?

540
00:25:18,458 --> 00:25:20,750
Because I told him
he has to use that inhaler--

541
00:25:20,792 --> 00:25:23,166
stop talking.

542
00:25:23,208 --> 00:25:25,875
I know
about the credit cards.

543
00:25:25,917 --> 00:25:28,041
What else have you stolen
from him?

544
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:31,166
Nothing. I mean--
tell me the truth, or i'm
going to call the police.

545
00:25:31,208 --> 00:25:33,041
It's just the credit cards.

546
00:25:33,083 --> 00:25:36,625
And I didn't even put much
on any of 'em.

547
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:40,041
The job pays like crap,
and it's a lot of work.

548
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:43,041
And I just... it's not easy
taking care of that guy.

549
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,041
He yells,
he has mood swings,

550
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:47,041
and I didn't even want
to take it,

551
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:50,375
but I have loans.
Get out.

552
00:25:50,417 --> 00:25:53,667
Get out. Walk out
of this office right now.

553
00:25:53,709 --> 00:25:56,542
And don't ever go back
and see Abe again.

554
00:25:58,083 --> 00:26:00,875
You know, just so you know,
he loves me.

555
00:26:00,917 --> 00:26:03,041
He won't press charges,
and...

556
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:05,083
He'll want me back.

557
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:07,417
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

558
00:26:09,083 --> 00:26:12,041
Hey, you have a minute?

559
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:14,041
Oh, uh, I-I was trying
to get out

560
00:26:14,083 --> 00:26:17,000
to see Olivia
before she goes to bed.

561
00:26:17,041 --> 00:26:20,041
Well, I, uh, I have something
that I want to tell you.

562
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:21,792
Well, I mean,
I don't want to tell you,

563
00:26:21,834 --> 00:26:24,166
but I need to tell you
or I should--
speak.

564
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:27,041
Okay. Uh...

565
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:30,709
I, uh...

566
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:33,542
I proposed to Sam.

567
00:26:33,583 --> 00:26:37,500
I asked Sam to marry me...
And, uh, well,

568
00:26:37,542 --> 00:26:40,500
and now--
stop talking.

569
00:26:40,542 --> 00:26:42,917
I have--
I have been supportive,

570
00:26:42,959 --> 00:26:45,333
and I have been friendly,
but i--

571
00:26:45,375 --> 00:26:47,458
I am done
being polite about this.

572
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,917
Addison, you suck
at relationships.

573
00:26:49,959 --> 00:26:53,500
You--you take other people's
men, and--and now that

574
00:26:53,542 --> 00:26:56,709
you have some man that wants to
cheat with you, you're tempted.

575
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:59,250
That's why you asked Sam
to marry you.
Nai, i--

576
00:26:59,291 --> 00:27:02,000
no, no, i--no. I-i--
as your friend, Addison,

577
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:05,875
I cannot hold this in anymore,
and as Sam's ex-wife...

578
00:27:05,917 --> 00:27:07,750
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

579
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,542
You--you have to go.

580
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:12,542
No. No, Nai,
we need to talk about this.

581
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:15,667
No. No. I am--
I'm done talking.

582
00:27:15,709 --> 00:27:17,667
She was stealing
from you, Abe.

583
00:27:17,709 --> 00:27:20,041
I've got underwear
older than that kid.

584
00:27:20,083 --> 00:27:22,917
You think she was fooling me?
I like to look at her ass.

585
00:27:22,959 --> 00:27:26,166
So it cost me a little?
Why do you give a damn?

586
00:27:26,208 --> 00:27:28,125
Because I was trying
to protect you.

587
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:29,875
I don't need protection.

588
00:27:29,917 --> 00:27:32,041
But you do need help.

589
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:34,041
I wish I didn't.

590
00:27:34,083 --> 00:27:36,583
I wish to god I didn't.

591
00:27:36,625 --> 00:27:39,542
For my whole life,
I was the help.

592
00:27:39,583 --> 00:27:41,500
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

593
00:27:41,542 --> 00:27:43,500
Esty's parents
were immigrants.

594
00:27:43,542 --> 00:27:46,542
They never had any good work,
so I took two jobs--

595
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:50,083
one stocking shelves,
one cutting meat--

596
00:27:50,125 --> 00:27:52,041
to give them something extra.

597
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:53,583
Esty was working, too,

598
00:27:53,625 --> 00:27:56,917
but then once Lisa came,
I-I didn't want her to have to,

599
00:27:56,959 --> 00:28:00,583
so I put off opening my deli
so she wouldn't worry.

600
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:04,500
Then when my Lisa got older
and we had a foothold,

601
00:28:04,542 --> 00:28:06,500
esty wanted
to go back to school.

602
00:28:06,542 --> 00:28:10,959
So I spent less time at work
and more time as a chauffer--

603
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,458
soccer practice, band concerts,
whatever she needed.

604
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,583
And I saved so that when Lisa
wanted to go to brown,

605
00:28:17,625 --> 00:28:19,375
the money was there.

606
00:28:19,417 --> 00:28:23,041
Barely, but it was there.

607
00:28:23,083 --> 00:28:25,417
Then when...

608
00:28:25,458 --> 00:28:27,834
Esty got sick...

609
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:29,625
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

610
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:31,625
â™ª and time,
it moves so slow â™ª

611
00:28:31,667 --> 00:28:34,583
I am the help.

612
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:37,375
â™ª With you â™ª

613
00:28:37,417 --> 00:28:38,625
â™ª so â™ª

614
00:28:38,667 --> 00:28:42,250
â™ª I â™ª

615
00:28:42,291 --> 00:28:43,291
â™ª lie â™ª

616
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,709
The bulgari.

617
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:07,208
Definitely the bulgari.

618
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:09,291
You've wanted it
since you were 4.

619
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:15,041
I'll probably have to pry it
out of your cold, dead hands.

620
00:29:18,083 --> 00:29:21,041
Can you please make sure
that Susan's dressed?

621
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:24,542
We're doing photographs
before the guests arrive.

622
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:29,917
Mm.

623
00:29:31,458 --> 00:29:33,083
Susan.

624
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:35,083
I'm in here.

625
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:37,083
Hey. Uh--

626
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:38,875
oh.

627
00:29:38,917 --> 00:29:42,125
Uh, bizzy is ready
to do the pictures, so she's--

628
00:29:42,166 --> 00:29:44,125
and she wants to know
when I'll be dressed?
Yes.

629
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:47,041
Give me ten minutes.
Okay.
Uh, do you need anything?

630
00:29:47,083 --> 00:29:48,792
No, I'm good. I'm good.
Okay.

631
00:29:48,834 --> 00:29:50,041
Addison.
Yeah.

632
00:29:50,083 --> 00:29:52,709
I just wanted to tell you
how grateful I am,

633
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,375
we both are,
for everything.

634
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:56,875
Thank you.

635
00:29:56,917 --> 00:30:00,166
It's nice for at least
one of you to acknowledge.

636
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:02,333
Bizzy doesn't...
Well, you know her.

637
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:05,375
Yeah, I thought I did.
But with you, she's...

638
00:30:07,125 --> 00:30:10,333
I don't know. I just never knew
that she could, uh--
love?

639
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:13,083
She loved you the second
that you were born,

640
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:16,208
but intimacy has to be
worked on both sides.

641
00:30:18,834 --> 00:30:20,417
Whoa.
Oh. Oh. Oh.

642
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:23,417
Are you okay?
Oh. Uh, yeah.
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

643
00:30:23,458 --> 00:30:25,417
Susan, what's going on?

644
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:27,208
I'm not better, Addie.

645
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:29,417
I'm bloating
and I'm weak again.

646
00:30:29,458 --> 00:30:31,333
And it feels like...

647
00:30:31,375 --> 00:30:34,208
I did
before I was diagnosed.

648
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,208
I know the cancer's
come back.

649
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,041
No. Dr. Rodriguez wouldn't
have discharged you

650
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:40,375
if that was the case.
He wanted me to stay
and do tests,

651
00:30:40,417 --> 00:30:43,083
but I didn't give him
a choice.

652
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:46,125
Don't be mad. Please.

653
00:30:46,166 --> 00:30:49,625
I need today.
Bizzy and I both do.
No, that's not a good idea.
All right?

654
00:30:49,667 --> 00:30:52,542
If the cancer's back,
then we need to fight it.

655
00:30:52,583 --> 00:30:55,417
We can post--we can delay your
wedding. We'll get you back--
Addison, listen to me.

656
00:30:55,458 --> 00:30:57,417
I signed a d.N.R.

657
00:30:57,458 --> 00:31:00,041
No delays, no more doctors,
no more exams,

658
00:31:00,083 --> 00:31:02,417
no extraordinary measures.

659
00:31:02,458 --> 00:31:04,250
And you can't tell bizzy.

660
00:31:04,291 --> 00:31:05,875
Susan, i--

661
00:31:05,917 --> 00:31:07,333
no.

662
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:09,458
Your mother and I...

663
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,333
Just give us today.

664
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,041
You all right?

665
00:31:25,458 --> 00:31:28,458
I need to ask you something.

666
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,917
A-And I need you
to be honest with me.

667
00:31:30,959 --> 00:31:32,291
Okay. Shoot.

668
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:34,458
Do I screw things up?

669
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,041
Oh, yeah.

670
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:39,041
Seriously? I mean, you know
what I'm asking, right?

671
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:41,041
Absolutely,
and the answer is yes.

672
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:43,709
When things get difficult
or scary in a relationship,

673
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:46,041
you screw it up.

674
00:31:46,083 --> 00:31:48,291
Y--well, you said
to be honest.

675
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:52,000
I was just coming to tell you
how beautiful you look.

676
00:31:52,041 --> 00:31:54,500
You knew about Susan.
She's sick,

677
00:31:54,542 --> 00:31:56,500
and you discharged her anyway.

678
00:31:56,542 --> 00:32:00,917
She wanted to be here
with your mother.
Yeah? Well, she should be

679
00:32:00,959 --> 00:32:03,041
back at the hospital
where we could help her,

680
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:05,917
and hopefully
give them more than this.
That's not
what Susan asked for.

681
00:32:05,959 --> 00:32:08,333
Addison...

682
00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:11,458
It's time, dear.

683
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:29,458
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

684
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:44,083
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

685
00:32:51,291 --> 00:32:54,291
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

686
00:33:11,333 --> 00:33:14,583
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

687
00:33:23,417 --> 00:33:25,917
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

688
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,166
Thank you, dear.

689
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:31,834
Mm.

690
00:33:31,875 --> 00:33:34,125
Well, you did it.

691
00:33:34,166 --> 00:33:37,166
Actually, you did it.

692
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:41,041
The wedding was lovely,
Addison.

693
00:33:58,709 --> 00:34:01,667
You think
we're ever gonna do this,

694
00:34:01,709 --> 00:34:05,041
actually get married?

695
00:34:05,083 --> 00:34:07,208
I do.

696
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:10,750
Me, too.

697
00:34:10,792 --> 00:34:13,000
Hmm.

698
00:34:13,041 --> 00:34:15,375
Just don't ask me when.

699
00:34:15,417 --> 00:34:18,000
I wasn't going to.

700
00:34:20,333 --> 00:34:23,041
You're not gonna believe
what...

701
00:34:23,083 --> 00:34:26,375
I think bizzy
just thanked me.

702
00:34:26,417 --> 00:34:28,792
Wow. Well, congratulations.

703
00:34:28,834 --> 00:34:31,000
Yes.

704
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,250
Sam...

705
00:34:34,291 --> 00:34:36,625
Sam...

706
00:34:36,667 --> 00:34:38,208
I was scared.

707
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:41,208
I am... scared.

708
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,500
Of what?
Of us.

709
00:34:43,542 --> 00:34:46,500
Of us not working, of me not
giving it a chance, everything.

710
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:49,333
I don't want to ruin it,
not with you.

711
00:34:49,375 --> 00:34:51,417
So instead,
you asked me to marry you?

712
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:53,250
I...

713
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:55,041
Yeah.

714
00:34:57,083 --> 00:34:59,041
You know,
you could take it back.

715
00:34:59,083 --> 00:35:00,917
No. I don't want--

716
00:35:00,959 --> 00:35:02,333
Addison...

717
00:35:02,375 --> 00:35:04,875
You can take it back.

718
00:35:04,917 --> 00:35:06,291
Okay. I take it back.

719
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:07,583
Okay.

720
00:35:13,083 --> 00:35:15,875
Let's drop!

721
00:35:15,917 --> 00:35:18,041
â™ª Yeah â™ª

722
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:20,417
â™ª come on â™ª

723
00:35:22,834 --> 00:35:26,291
â™ª Shake, shake â™ª

724
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:27,792
â™ª I'll take you home â™ª

725
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:30,458
What happened with Larry
is not your fault.

726
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,041
I know.

727
00:35:32,083 --> 00:35:34,458
But I should've
seen it coming.

728
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,083
We can't always see
what's closest to us.

729
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:38,917
He needs help.

730
00:35:38,959 --> 00:35:41,917
I know.
Sheldon, he needs real help.

731
00:35:41,959 --> 00:35:44,041
I can't do that.

732
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:47,875
If Larry were a patient--
he's not. He's my mentor
and my friend.

733
00:35:47,917 --> 00:35:50,041
All the more reason.

734
00:35:50,083 --> 00:35:54,291
He could lose his job
and his license.

735
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:56,041
It'll destroy him.

736
00:35:56,083 --> 00:35:59,041
He's your mentor
and your friend.

737
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:01,083
â™ª Will you move her
like that? â™ª

738
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:04,041
â™ª Come on, shake, shake,
shake, shake, a-shake it â™ª

739
00:36:04,083 --> 00:36:05,792
â™ª shake, shake â™ª

740
00:36:05,834 --> 00:36:07,542
â™ª shake, shake, a-shake it â™ª

741
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:09,083
â™ª shake, shake â™ª

742
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,959
â™ª shake, shake, a-shake it â™ª

743
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,500
â™ª shake, shake â™ª

744
00:36:12,542 --> 00:36:14,709
â™ª shake, shake, a-shake it â™ª

745
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:16,041
You okay?

746
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:17,709
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

747
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,583
I, uh, was just thinking
about Abe.

748
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:21,542
Yeah, he's alienated Lisa,

749
00:36:21,583 --> 00:36:24,500
and he's trying as hard
as he can to do the same to me.

750
00:36:24,542 --> 00:36:27,583
Did you ever think that maybe
he just doesn't like you?

751
00:36:29,041 --> 00:36:31,333
Well, I am
the pain-in-the-ass doctor,

752
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:32,792
so yeah.
Yeah.

753
00:36:32,834 --> 00:36:35,000
It's Lisa, though.

754
00:36:35,041 --> 00:36:37,000
He loves her
as much as he loved esty.

755
00:36:37,041 --> 00:36:39,417
I think he's just scared
of being a burden.

756
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:41,417
Well,
sometimes fear makes...

757
00:36:41,458 --> 00:36:45,000
You push away
the people you love.

758
00:36:45,041 --> 00:36:48,125
â™ª Now if she does it like this,
will you turn her like that? â™ª

759
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:51,417
Sometimes it makes you try
to pull them even closer.

760
00:36:51,458 --> 00:36:55,041
â™ª Now if she moves like this,
will you move her like that? â™ª

761
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:57,583
â™ª Come on, shake, shake,
shake, shake, a-shake it â™ª

762
00:36:57,625 --> 00:36:59,208
Thank you.

763
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,792
â™ª Shake, shake,
shake, shake, a-shake it â™ª

764
00:37:01,834 --> 00:37:03,667
Well...
Are you leaving?

765
00:37:03,709 --> 00:37:05,917
Time to be
the pain-in-the-ass doctor.

766
00:37:05,959 --> 00:37:08,417
â™ª Shake, shake, a-shake it â™ª

767
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:10,583
Hey. About before--

768
00:37:10,625 --> 00:37:12,500
shh. Dance with me.

769
00:37:12,542 --> 00:37:14,000
â™ª Shake, shake, a-shake it â™ª

770
00:37:15,208 --> 00:37:17,625
â™ª Shake, shake,
shake, shake, a-shake it â™ª

771
00:37:17,667 --> 00:37:21,083
â™ª shake, shake,
shake, shake, a-shake it â™ª

772
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:24,417
â™ª shake, shake,
shake, shake, a-shake it â™ª

773
00:37:26,917 --> 00:37:28,667
Mind if I come in?

774
00:37:28,709 --> 00:37:31,041
If I say yes,
you wouldn't listen.

775
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:33,041
May as well save my breath.

776
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:35,041
I'm not alone, Abe.

777
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:36,917
Hi, daddy.

778
00:37:36,959 --> 00:37:39,750
Has it been
six months already?
Come on.
Don't be like that.

779
00:37:39,792 --> 00:37:42,417
Like what?
Don't push her away.
She's not your enemy.

780
00:37:42,458 --> 00:37:44,750
You love her.
She's family,

781
00:37:44,792 --> 00:37:47,750
which means she's supposed
to be here, no matter what,

782
00:37:47,792 --> 00:37:50,500
even if you say
you don't need her

783
00:37:50,542 --> 00:37:54,250
or don't want her to know
that you do.
Ah, don't listen to him.
He's very dramatic.

784
00:37:56,542 --> 00:37:58,500
I want you
to come live with me.

785
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:00,709
You'd hate it.
So would I.

786
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,041
I wouldn't.

787
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:04,041
And neither would Barry
or the boys. We'd love it.

788
00:38:04,083 --> 00:38:06,041
No.

789
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:08,041
Why?

790
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:10,333
Did you tell her to sucker me
in to another rant?

791
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:11,875
No, sir.

792
00:38:11,917 --> 00:38:15,041
But he did tell me what
you said, and you're right.

793
00:38:15,083 --> 00:38:18,583
You've always been the help,
to mom and to me.

794
00:38:18,625 --> 00:38:21,583
But now that can change.

795
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:24,125
I won't do that to you.
I can't.

796
00:38:24,166 --> 00:38:26,959
Well, you know what?
I'm not asking.

797
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,458
She's not askin'.

798
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,542
Daddy, please.
Let me help.

799
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:44,125
Daddy.

800
00:38:50,041 --> 00:38:52,750
Hey.
Too much champagne?

801
00:38:52,792 --> 00:38:54,750
I was just going
to freshen up.

802
00:38:54,792 --> 00:38:56,750
You kissed off
all my lipstick.

803
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:57,834
Sorry.

804
00:38:57,875 --> 00:38:59,667
I wasn't complainin'.

805
00:39:01,709 --> 00:39:03,917
I just wanted to get another one
in before you reapply.

806
00:39:03,959 --> 00:39:07,250
I'll see you out there.

807
00:39:19,834 --> 00:39:21,667
You okay?

808
00:39:21,709 --> 00:39:25,041
I'm fine.

809
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:28,125
I'm really fine.

810
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:30,750
Should we get a room?

811
00:39:30,792 --> 00:39:33,208
We don't need one.

812
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:37,125
â™ª I may not always love you â™ª

813
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:41,125
â™ª but as long
as there are stars above you â™ª

814
00:39:41,166 --> 00:39:45,375
â™ª you'll never need
to doubt it â™ª

815
00:39:45,417 --> 00:39:50,041
â™ª I'll make you
so sure about it â™ª

816
00:39:50,083 --> 00:39:55,083
â™ª god only knows
what I'd be without you â™ª

817
00:39:58,458 --> 00:40:01,291
Ah, Sheldon, come on in.
I'm cooking dinner.

818
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:03,375
I'm not hungry, Larry.
Hey, your loss.

819
00:40:03,417 --> 00:40:05,458
I'm making carbonara sauce
from scratch.

820
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,834
You've had
a psychotic break.

821
00:40:07,875 --> 00:40:10,375
Nonsense.
I-I had an off day.

822
00:40:10,417 --> 00:40:13,834
Hey, but now that you're here,
all that's gonna change.

823
00:40:13,875 --> 00:40:17,041
Now what are
you drinking, scotch or wine?

824
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:21,333
â™ª ...I'd be without you â™ª

825
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:24,542
I'm sorry, Larry.

826
00:40:24,583 --> 00:40:26,458
You son of a bitch!

827
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:29,041
No, get off me!

828
00:40:29,083 --> 00:40:31,750
Get off me! Ow!
Don't--don't fight them,
Larry.

829
00:40:31,792 --> 00:40:33,917
Ow! How could you
do this to me?

830
00:40:33,959 --> 00:40:36,041
Ah! Get off of me!

831
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:39,875
Hey, you're hurting him!
You need to stay back, sir.
Let us do our job.

832
00:40:42,792 --> 00:40:45,250
I'm your friend!

833
00:40:45,291 --> 00:40:47,208
I'm your friend!

834
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:51,208
â™ª So what good
would living do me? â™ª

835
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:56,083
â™ª God only knows
what I'd be without you â™ª

836
00:40:59,709 --> 00:41:04,000
â™ª God only knows
what I'd be without you â™ª

837
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:07,750
â™ª god only knows â™ª

838
00:41:07,792 --> 00:41:09,917
â™ª god only knows â™ª

839
00:41:09,959 --> 00:41:13,750
â™ª what I'd be without you â™ª

840
00:41:13,792 --> 00:41:15,542
â™ª god only knows â™ª

841
00:41:17,583 --> 00:41:20,959
â™ª What I'd be without you â™ª

842
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,500
I took it back.

843
00:41:23,542 --> 00:41:25,166
My proposal.

844
00:41:25,208 --> 00:41:27,208
You can do that?

845
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:30,041
I don't know.
But I did.

846
00:41:30,083 --> 00:41:31,291
Oh.

847
00:41:31,333 --> 00:41:33,291
I don't know.
Maybe you're right.

848
00:41:33,333 --> 00:41:36,917
I hope not, but... I'm gonna
make it work with Sam.

849
00:41:36,959 --> 00:41:38,917
I will.

850
00:41:38,959 --> 00:41:41,583
â™ª God only knows â™ª

851
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:44,041
