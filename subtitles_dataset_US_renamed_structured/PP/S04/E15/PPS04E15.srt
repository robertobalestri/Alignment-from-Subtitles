New York is far.

5
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:16,041
It's a plane ride away.

6
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:18,959
You want Maya
a plane ride away?

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,583
Well, she said that the Dean
of admissions called her

8
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:24,208
"perfect Columbia material."
Which makes me proud,

9
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,959
but do--do you want Olivia
a plane ride away?

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,041
No, no.
Olivia's not going anywhere.

11
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:31,208
Mnh-mnh.

12
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:34,041
What do you hear
from Addie?

13
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:35,542
Uh, Archer left.

14
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:37,542
She's gonna stay
a few more days

15
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:40,041
and help the captain
get ready to move out.
She holdin' up?

16
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:42,125
Sounds like it, yeah.

17
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:43,959
How about you?

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,959
Well, things have been
a little crazy

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,458
between Addison
and me lately, so...

20
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,250
Some time apart
might be good.

21
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:53,166
But it's good. I'm good.

22
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:55,667
You're lonely.
I have Olivia.

23
00:00:55,709 --> 00:00:59,583
Yeah, I bet when you're
feeling sorry for yourself,

24
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:01,792
you keep her up later
than you're supposed to.

25
00:01:01,834 --> 00:01:03,917
You do. You know you do.

26
00:01:03,959 --> 00:01:07,041
I exercise
the grandfather's prerogative,

27
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:09,000
uh, from time to time.

28
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:12,041
Well, since one baby
needs her sleep

29
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:14,041
and the other one
needs some company...

30
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:17,875
Why don't we pick a night,
and I'll come back,

31
00:01:17,917 --> 00:01:21,458
and we'll put her down on time,
and then I'll cook dinner?

32
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,458
What if we keep her up
a little later

33
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,792
and order in?

34
00:01:25,834 --> 00:01:27,041
Deal.

35
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:28,291
Okay.

36
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:32,041
You got it?

37
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:32,959
Uh-huh.

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,083
Mm.

39
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:38,083
Hey, I can finish up if you
want to get ready for work.

40
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:40,083
We're fine.

41
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:43,041
You can't still be mad.
Oh, that's where
you're wrong.

42
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:45,083
Come on, Pete.

43
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:48,041
You know I had to rewrite
the manuscript.

44
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:50,959
The publisher asked me
to go deeper, and to do that,

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,500
I had to share all my stories
and--and the people in them.

46
00:01:53,542 --> 00:01:55,208
Going deeper into your life
is fine.

47
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,458
But completely exposing mine
is not.
But you're a part
of my life.

48
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,917
My first marriage isn't.

49
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,959
And neither is the fact
my mother's in prison.

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,542
But you--
you overcame all that.
Which makes it my story,
not yours.

52
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:08,166
Okay. Well, um...

53
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:10,959
I gave the revision to
everybody else in the practice

54
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,959
when they got back
from bizzy's funeral,

55
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,250
and no one else has had
a problem with it.
I don't care
what anyone else thinks.

56
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:18,375

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,583
We were cooking dinner
together with Jack,

61
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:28,333
that's my fiancé,

62
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:30,583
and it just--it happened.

63
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:33,834
She got quiet
and she seemed confused,

64
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:35,834
and then her voice changed.

65
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:38,750
And I asked, "Andi,
are you okay?" And then...

66
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:41,125
Gina responded.

67
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:43,834
Gina?
That's one of her others.

68
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:47,000
That's what my sister calls
her alternate personalities.

69
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,125
Was that the first time
that's happened?

70
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:55,208
Andi was diagnosed with
multiple personality disorder

71
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,041
when she was 7.

72
00:02:57,083 --> 00:03:00,041
We were, uh, driving to dinner
with my parents.

73
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,917
It was raining.

74
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:04,041
A car barreled through
the intersection.

75
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,041
Our parents died.
We survived.

76
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:09,041
And it took
a lot of therapy,

77
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,041
but i'm--
I'm with her everyday.

78
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,875
I haven't seen
another personality in...

79
00:03:13,917 --> 00:03:16,000
Almost ten years.

80
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:23,041
I had already
tucked Tanya in

81
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:25,041
and was getting ready
for bed myself

82
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:27,041
when I heard these noises
coming from her room.

83
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,041
Sometimes
she likes to stay up,

84
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,667
playing with her stuffed
animals, but when I went in...
It was just Ricky.

85
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:34,750
Who's Ricky?
My friend.
We go to school together.

86
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:37,041
Yeah.
They were
having sex, Dr. Bennett.

87
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,417
He comes over sometimes.

88
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:41,250
Apparently,
it's been going on for a while.

89
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:43,500
Don't tell your mom.
Oh.

90
00:03:43,542 --> 00:03:46,208
She'd been complaining
of stomach pains.

91
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,875
I didn't know why,
and now...

92
00:03:48,917 --> 00:03:50,875
I think she needs
a pregnancy test.

93
00:03:50,917 --> 00:03:52,875
Oh, well, stomach pains
could mean anything.

94
00:03:52,917 --> 00:03:54,875
It could be the flu,
it could be appendicitis.

95
00:03:54,917 --> 00:03:56,041
Please.

96
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,291
Okay. All right.

97
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,291
Tanya, why don't you
lie back for me, okay?

98
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,041
I'm gonna check your belly.

99
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,041
You're not gonna check
my heart?

100
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,041
I know I normally do
check your heart,

101
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,417
but today, I'm gonna look
inside your belly

102
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,041
with a special machine.

103
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:13,291
This may be a little chilly.
You ready? Mm.

104
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,208
Yuck.
I know.

105
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,125
You know how closely
I watch her.

106
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,458
Erin, you are a great mother,
and of a teenager,

107
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,917
which means hormones and...

108
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:25,542
What's in my belly?

109
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,667
Oh, god.

110
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:44,041
Lara's been taking care of me
since our parents died.

111
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,041
She had just turned 18,
and suddenly,

112
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:49,041
she was looking after
a 7 year old full-time.

113
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,041
Which is how
she still treats me.

114
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,542
She's a big sister.

115
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:55,166
Yeah, but it's
almost 20 years later.

116
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,959
I have a job.
I pay my bills.

117
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,041
She can't
worry about me forever.

118
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:04,000
Losing your parents
at such an early age

119
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,750
is a significant trauma.

120
00:05:05,792 --> 00:05:09,792
And I think she's worried
about how you're coping.

121
00:05:09,834 --> 00:05:12,000
Meaning, she's worried
about my others.

122
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,375
She mentioned them.

123
00:05:13,417 --> 00:05:15,041
But she also said

124
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,667
that they had gone away
for a long time.

125
00:05:17,709 --> 00:05:19,542
Yeah.

126
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:22,041
It's okay, Andi.

127
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,000
It's not your fault.

128
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,041
Lara said
that you were having dinner

129
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,750
when one
of your others appeared.

130
00:05:30,792 --> 00:05:32,750
Do you remember anything
about that?

131
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:34,041
No. I black out.

132
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,000
I-I don't know
what they say or do.

133
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,041
It's awful.

134
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,375
So you
can't remember anything?

135
00:05:41,417 --> 00:05:43,417
Not really.

136
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,583
Nothing at all?

137
00:05:47,834 --> 00:05:49,583
Andi?

138
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:56,041
She answered the question,
jackass.

139
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,000
My name is Gina.

140
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:01,875
And you need
to back the hell off!

141
00:06:01,917 --> 00:06:03,875
I think shrinks are good.

142
00:06:03,917 --> 00:06:05,917
I think talking is good,

143
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:08,000
and Charlotte and I
as a couple, we're...

144
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,208
Good.

145
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,208
But here you are, so I have to
assume there are some issues.

146
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,959
We don't have issues.

147
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,208
Well, no big ones.

148
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,041
Uh...

149
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,041
She won't wear
her engagement ring.

150
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:26,000
It was broken, and I had it
fixed and polished.

151
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,500
How did it break?

152
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:29,041
I was raped.

153
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,041
The attacker
broke my left hand.

154
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,041
They had to cut it off
at the hospital.

155
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:36,041
Well, that must have been
very difficult for you.

156
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,709
The ring's a reminder.

157
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,041
Why didn't you tell me?

158
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:43,041
I'll buy you another one.
I don't want another one.

159
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:45,834
You can't wear the one you have,
but you don't want another one?

160
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,500
What does that even mean?

161
00:06:47,542 --> 00:06:51,041
Well, it seems we do have
something to talk about.

162
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,875
I mean, one minute,
she's talking calmly,

163
00:06:53,917 --> 00:06:56,709
and then bam. She's yelling
obscenities at me.
Andi?

164
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,041
Gina. Her alter.

165
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,417
What was she mad at?

166
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,750
Me. She thought I was attacking
Lara and her fiancé.

167
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:04,250
I mean,
Gina's very protective.

168
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,917
And how did you know
it wasn't Andi?

169
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,125
The transformation
was remarkable--

170
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,959
the--the inflection,
the--the change in her posture.

171
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,750
And you're sure
she wasn't faking it?
Every woman does.

172
00:07:13,792 --> 00:07:15,417
No, that's... we're talking

173
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,959
about a patient with multiple
personality disorder, not, uh...

174
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:20,917
Orgasms. Gotcha.

175
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:24,959
Is that even real--
the whole Sybil thing?
Gina's very convincing,
and she was not happy

176
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,959
that I was poking around
in Andi's head.
Well, can't blame her
for that.

177
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,917
Oh, says the girl who delights
in drilling holes in skulls.

178
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:32,083
Well, at least what I do
is rooted in science.

179
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:35,041
There is pet-scan data
evidencing neurological changes

180
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,959
in the brains of patients
with m.P.D.

181
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,917
One. One study, and it is
right up there with that wacko

182
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,125
who said that vaccinating
your kid causes autism.

183
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:45,041
I am not saying I don't believe
in dissociated behavior.

184
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:48,333
I-i-I've had patients with
borderline personality disorders

185
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,333
who--who act out,
who--who try to manipulate.

186
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:55,041
But it's usually
for, uh, for personal gain.

187
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,041
You... Okay, no.

188
00:07:57,083 --> 00:08:00,333
I'm sorry. I know this is
totally uncool of me to ask,

189
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:03,000
but, um...

190
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:05,041
Have either of you
read my manuscript?

191
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,834
The one where you basically
call me a whore?

192
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:10,208
Yep, I read it.

193
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,041
That's not what i-i--no.

194
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,041
Y-You have a certain
sexual confidence,

195
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,041
which--which is great.

196
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:19,291
And I was trying to
contrast that with the fact

197
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:22,709
that I had some, uh, issues
with intimacy after the attack.

198
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,041
Ah.
Well, y-you understood that,
didn't you?

199
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,041
I haven't gotten
to that part.

200
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,542
I'm still enjoying the section
where you're discussing

201
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:32,750
cheating on Pete with me
and then chucking me overboard.

202
00:08:32,792 --> 00:08:35,709
Not that I don't enjoy being
described as "rebound sex."

203
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,333
Sheldon, I never said--
I believe "sexual leftovers"
was your phrase.

204
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:41,542
I mean, honestly, Violet, if
you're gonna go down that road,

205
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,041
the least you could have done

206
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,208
is discuss
my more positive attributes.

207
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,041
So if you have any more books
in you, I would appreciate it

208
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,417
if you'd refrain

209
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,959
from any and all discussion
of our sexual history

210
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,458
as well as any failure

211
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,667
I might have had
in pursuing you romantically.

212
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:58,000
What he's really saying--
"filter."

213
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,041
Tanya can't
safely carry a baby

214
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,041
let alone deliver one,
can she?

215
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,041
Well, because of
the cardiac issues

216
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,417
that are secondary
to down's,

217
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:10,417
it would be
a high-risk pregnancy.

218
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:13,166
But with proper monitoring,
yes, she could do it.

219
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,166
Yeah.

220
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:18,041
I mean, Tanya has down's,

221
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,041
Ricky has
severe learning disabilities.

222
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,625
I just--i don't know how
they could raise a child.

223
00:09:22,667 --> 00:09:24,083
Well, they'd need your help.

224
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:26,041
And if the baby has
special needs, too?

225
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,667
Well, i-it may not.
Yes, there's a 50% chance

226
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:31,417
that the baby could be born
with down's and could be

227
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:34,041
at greater risk for other kinds
of complications, but--

228
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,667
please, Dr. Bennett.

229
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:38,000
I appreciate how supportive
you're trying to be.

230
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,041
I-I love Tanya

231
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:42,834
more than anything.

232
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:46,125
But after I had her,
I couldn't have another child.

233
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:49,125
I wanted to keep her at home,
raise her myself,

234
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:52,291
and it was so much work.

235
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:55,709
Tanya couldn't do it,
and i'm...

236
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,625
I don't know
if I can do it again.

237
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:02,834
So you're prepared...

238
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,208
To abort the baby?

239
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,333
I'm not sure
I have another option.

240
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,041
Well, how would Tanya feel
about that?

241
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,875
Erin has power of attorney
for Tanya,

242
00:10:13,917 --> 00:10:16,041
so it would be her decision.

243
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,792
Okay, well, at this point,
it's--it's a procedure.

244
00:10:18,834 --> 00:10:21,166
It's not a pill.
So what would you tell Tanya?

245
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:24,041
Well, I wouldn't want
to lie to her.

246
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,291
But...

247
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:30,041
Why don't you take some time
to really think this over?

248
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,041
And, uh, in the interim,
we can do c.V.S.

249
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,083
Genetic screening?

250
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,500
If you are serious
about this abortion,

251
00:10:36,542 --> 00:10:38,792
Tanya is already 11 weeks.

252
00:10:38,834 --> 00:10:40,959
A couple more days,
it becomes a bigger procedure.

253
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,667
But if we do the c.V.S.,
you'll be able to know

254
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:45,542
whether or not the baby
has down's

255
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:48,375
or any other abnormalities
or if the baby is fine.

256
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,542
Well, then...

257
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,583
Let's--
let's do the test.

258
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,750
Great.

259
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,166
You know
what I don't understand?

260
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,750
Why can't people
just be happy for me?

261
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:09,041
I wrote a book.
It's a big deal.

262
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:12,333
When Sam published a book,
we threw him a damn party.

263
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:15,959
Why aren't you
looking up at me?

264
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,917
Oh, not you, too.

265
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:20,000
"Man-child"?

266
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:25,041
Okay. Uh, yes.

267
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,333
I did call you that once.

268
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,083
Maybe twice.

269
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,375
But--but that isn't
all that I said about you.

270
00:11:31,417 --> 00:11:33,875
I-I-I repeatedly refer to you
as my best friend.

271
00:11:33,917 --> 00:11:35,625
Man... child.

272
00:11:35,667 --> 00:11:38,667
Oh, come on, Coop.
I need someone on my side.

273
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:40,166
Man-child!

274
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,166
You guilted Erin
into taking that test.

275
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,166
No, I am just trying
to make sure

276
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,875
that she understands
the situation

277
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:50,875
before she makes a decision
that she and Tanya might regret.

278
00:11:50,917 --> 00:11:53,166
You just didn't want her
to have an abortion.

279
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,166
No. No, I don't want her
to have an abortion.

280
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,166
But you're not the one
that's gonna have to raise

281
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,917
that child--her grandchild.

282
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,041
I know what it's like
to help raise a grandchild.

283
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,041
What are you
hoping for here, Nai--

284
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:06,041
a healthy baby and for Erin to
decide that Tanya can keep it?

285
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,792
Yes.
And if that baby has down's,
then what?

286
00:12:08,834 --> 00:12:10,709
I know you're not gonna advise
her to have an abortion.

287
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,917
The catholic in you
couldn't tolerate the sin

288
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,458
while the doctor would worry
it feels like eugenics.

289
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,458
Look, if Erin has
the responsibility

290
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,458
of raising two children
with down's, how good

291
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,041
do you think that's gonna be
for Tanya and the baby?

292
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,166
What's gonna happen
when Erin's gone?

293
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:27,792
The longer this goes on,
the more aware Tanya's gonna be,

294
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:30,208
and the harder
it's gonna be for Erin

295
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,250
to explain to her daughter
that she doesn't want

296
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:35,041
to have another baby
that's like her.
Maybe the baby
won't have down's.

297
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:37,041
Maybe the baby
won't have anything.

298
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,291
That's the hope you're selling
her--of having the baby

299
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:42,041
she didn't get
the first time around.
I never said that.

300
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,333
You didn't have to.

301
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,250
She does seem
to be dissociating.

302
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,542
I've known Andi
for five years, Dr. Wallace--

303
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,542
almost as long
as I've known Lara.

304
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:57,041
Not once have I seen any of
these so-called personalities.

305
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,917
I know this disorder can be
difficult to understand.

306
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:02,291
Disorder? Is that what we call
it when my future sister-in-law

307
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:05,291
decides to go crazy cakes
a week before we move?

308
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:08,500
Calling her crazy
is not helping the situation.

309
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:13,166
I'm sorry.
You're right.

310
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:18,041
So...
Where are you moving?

311
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,333
Arizona.
Jack got promoted.

312
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,333
I'll be managing
a new plant in Phoenix.

313
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,333
We're supposed to go down
this weekend

314
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:26,041
and look for houses.
No, you're gonna have to go
without me.

315
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,041
I'm gonna have to stay here.

316
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,917
We talked about this at dinner,
before your sister started--
stop it.

317
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,041
Look...

318
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,875
I'm not going without you.

319
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:37,792
I can't leave Andi.
I'm sorry.

320
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:44,709
Thank you.

321
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,417
Hey.

322
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,417
You can stop being
all moody moose now.

323
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,542
I'm wearing it.

324
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:53,375
I don't want you
to wear it.

325
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:54,834
Yes, you do.

326
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,375
No, I...

327
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:58,375
You were wearing it
when he raped you.

328
00:13:58,417 --> 00:14:01,417
I was also wearing
my skin that day.

329
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:04,375
There's nothing I can do
about it.

330
00:14:04,417 --> 00:14:06,291
If you don't want
to wear the ring,

331
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,834
you shouldn't wear it.

332
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,834
Why can't I get you
another one?

333
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,875
It's a waste of money.
It's just a ring.

334
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:13,875
It's an engagement ring.
It says you're mine.

335
00:14:13,917 --> 00:14:15,375
It makes it official.

336
00:14:15,417 --> 00:14:18,041
We're official because we're
committed to each other.

337
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:20,333
There are steps in people's
lives together, Charlotte--

338
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,875
sex, moving in,
ring, marriage.

339
00:14:22,917 --> 00:14:24,417
We're on the ring.

340
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,375
Which I'm wearing.

341
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:31,041
"And then the woman I thought
was my friend and confidant

342
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:35,041
told a judge I shouldn't be
given custody of my own child."

343
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,792
Paging Addison Montgomery.

344
00:14:37,834 --> 00:14:40,333
"It was hardly
an impartial opinion

345
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,041
"since at the time,

346
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,417
she was basically
living with my son's father."

347
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:47,291
Oh, man. I better hide Addison's
copy of this manuscript

348
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:50,041
before she gets back.
Anything can be made
to sound bad

349
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:52,041
when it's taken
out of context.

350
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:55,041
Like the part where Violet
says she reconsidered

351
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,917
all of the parenting advice
you gave her

352
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:01,041
once your 16-year-old daughter
got knocked up?
She did not drag Maya
into this.

353
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,291
Mm-hmm.
You know what part
I thought was a hoot?

354
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:06,041
The section where she hinted
that I don't know my fiancé

355
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,208
as well as she does.
That's no hint.

356
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,000
She dragged Maya
into this.

357
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:18,750
Don't look at me.
I didn't write the damn book.

358
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:21,875
You need
to sit her down, Pete.
And say what?

359
00:15:21,917 --> 00:15:24,667
- That she needs to take us out of the book.
- Tell her own story.

360
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:27,750
Don't drag the rest of us
through the mud.
What makes you think
she's gonna listen to me?

361
00:15:27,792 --> 00:15:29,750
She has to,
'cause you're the only one

362
00:15:29,792 --> 00:15:33,000
who's still talking to her.

363
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:44,250
Okay, we're almost there.

364
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:47,041
This feels funny.
Hang in there, Tanya.

365
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,709
And...

366
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,041
We... are done.

367
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,041
- You did a great job.
- Right.

368
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,917
Are you okay?

369
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,125
I'm okay, mom. Did you get rid
of the dot we saw in my belly?

370
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:02,709
Uh, that's not
what this was, honey.

371
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,041
I didn't like it.

372
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:08,709
I-I-Is Tanya here?
I-I'm Ricky.

373
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,166
- Ricky!
- Ricky, could you give us just a minute?

374
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,041
Uh, Tanya's almost done.

375
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,166
No, come in.

376
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,709
A-A-Are you okay?
I'm okay.

377
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:22,333
Uh, wh-wh-wh-what--
what were you doing?

378
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,834
We were doing a test.

379
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,709
It was a test
on a baby.

380
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,750
You and Tanya made a baby,

381
00:16:38,792 --> 00:16:40,917
and it's in her belly.

382
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,083
We--we--we made a baby!

383
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,583
We made a baby?!

384
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,625
I remember art therapy.

385
00:16:51,667 --> 00:16:53,709
My last shrink
was a big fan.

386
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,375
It's just another way
of expressing yourself.

387
00:17:04,834 --> 00:17:07,333
I met your sister's fiancé
yesterday.

388
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,792
Jack?
He's a good guy.

389
00:17:09,834 --> 00:17:11,792
So you two get along?

390
00:17:11,834 --> 00:17:14,041
Why wouldn't we?

391
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:17,750
He told me about
his new job in Arizona.

392
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:20,041
Are you planning
on moving there with them?

393
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:24,000
No. It's just gonna be
the two of them.

394
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,667
Are you okay with that?

395
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:28,041
Sure.

396
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:29,667
Does this look like Jack?

397
00:17:29,709 --> 00:17:32,000
Yeah.

00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,208
After you were raped.

521
00:22:40,417 --> 00:22:44,834
♪♪♪

522
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:00,041
You will be happy to know
you're not alone.

523
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:01,959
Everybody hates my book.

524
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:04,667
Look, we're all proud of you
for writing it,

525
00:23:04,709 --> 00:23:06,917
we just don't want
to be in it.
Everything I wrote is true.

526
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:09,166
And if you took all of us out,
everything that's left

527
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:10,625
would still be true,

528
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:13,166
and we could go back
to being proud of you.

529
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:16,417
But it's a better book now,
Pete. You have to see that.

530
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:18,875
And--and this is what
the publisher was looking for.

531
00:23:18,917 --> 00:23:21,375
It'll sell,
and--and I want that.

532
00:23:21,417 --> 00:23:24,000
N--
not because I am selfish,

533
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:26,834
but because I think this book
will really help people.

534
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:28,375
It'll help people.

535
00:23:28,417 --> 00:23:31,041
What if it alienates the people
you love in the process?

536
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:33,375
I don't want to have to choose
between the two.

537
00:23:33,417 --> 00:23:35,375
Well, that's where we are.

538
00:23:35,417 --> 00:23:37,417
You know how everybody feels,
Violet.

539
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:40,500
What you do with that
is your call.

540
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:51,125
I screwed up.

541
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:53,041
I am so...

542
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:55,500
So, so, sorry.

543
00:23:55,542 --> 00:23:58,083
Unbelievably sorry.

544
00:23:58,125 --> 00:24:01,000
How can I
make this better?

545
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:07,000
You won't even look at me?

546
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:12,542
You know, in the past,
I have forgiven you

547
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:14,083
because I could see beyond

548
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:16,083
what you've done
in a moment of crazy

549
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:18,083
to who you really were,
who you are.

550
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:20,959
Don't I get
the same courtesy?

551
00:24:22,542 --> 00:24:24,875
Oh, my god.
Charlotte, look at me.

552
00:24:24,917 --> 00:24:27,750
Come--glare, scowl, yell.

553
00:24:27,792 --> 00:24:29,291
Punch me.

554
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:32,542
Come on.
You have to fight back.

555
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:34,041
Mm.

556
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:37,083
Cooper,
you told me something.

557
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:39,917
Now I get to process.

558
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:41,709
Let me.

559
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:02,583
Hey.

560
00:25:02,625 --> 00:25:05,583
Either Andi's Meryl Streep
or this thing is real.

561
00:25:05,625 --> 00:25:07,583
So it's true
multiple personality disorder?

562
00:25:07,625 --> 00:25:10,583
I started art therapy with her
during our last session.

563
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:12,583
When--when she shifted
from Andi to Maggie--

564
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:15,959
Maggie? I thought
it was Gina.
No, Gina's the older,
angry one.

565
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,959
Maggie is the emotional,
little one.

566
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,125
It was her this time.
Anyway, when they switched,

567
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:22,041
Maggie continued to draw,
right?

568
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:25,041
But this time
with her left hand. Look.

569
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:28,792
This is Andi on the right,
and Maggie on the left.

570
00:25:28,834 --> 00:25:30,333
Her different personalities

571
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:32,333
draw with different hands
with the same ease.

572
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:34,333
You know, only 3%
of the population

573
00:25:34,375 --> 00:25:36,875
is ambidextrous.
So you've made
your diagnosis.

574
00:25:36,917 --> 00:25:38,333
Well, yes, and...

575
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:40,041
No.

576
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:42,792
I-I'm not--
something's not right.

577
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:44,792
I know this disorder
presents strangely, but--

578
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:47,333
well, does it really matter?
I mean, whatever the reason,

579
00:25:47,375 --> 00:25:49,208
this woman
is profoundly disturbed.

580
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,291
And whatever
you want to call it,

581
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:54,208
you have to keep
treating her.
Well, if Andi is faking it
to stop Lara

582
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:58,041
from moving on with her life,
I-I need to know that.
Well, just... be careful.

583
00:25:58,083 --> 00:26:01,583
If--if you push too hard,
she could collapse emotionally,

584
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:03,458
and then...
Then everybody loses.

585
00:26:08,625 --> 00:26:11,792
I didn't mean to make this
harder on Erin.

586
00:26:11,834 --> 00:26:14,041
I know.
But I did.

587
00:26:14,083 --> 00:26:16,500
Yeah. Yeah.

588
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:19,500
God, I just, you know, I just
keep thinking about Olivia,

589
00:26:19,542 --> 00:26:23,041
and if we had encouraged Maya
to terminate.

590
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:24,709
Well, you did.

591
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,542
I know I did.

592
00:26:27,583 --> 00:26:29,083
But she didn't.

593
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:30,834
And I'm so grateful.

594
00:26:30,875 --> 00:26:33,834
Of course, but... it's
different with Erin.

595
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:35,834
You know, she's alone
raising Tanya,

596
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:38,834
and with another baby,
down's or no down's,

597
00:26:38,875 --> 00:26:41,291
it's--it's a lot.
Oh, Sam.

598
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,750
What are we gonna do
if Maya gets in to Columbia?

599
00:26:43,792 --> 00:26:46,125
Ugh. I've been thinking
about that, too.

600
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:49,709
Oh, it's... it's not easy
to be a student and a mom.

601
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,834
Well, we'll figure it out.

602
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:53,542
We always do.

603
00:26:55,458 --> 00:26:56,917
Yeah, well...

604
00:26:56,959 --> 00:26:58,917
It's--it's not the same...

605
00:26:58,959 --> 00:27:00,458
You and me.

606
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,041
What do you mean?

607
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:03,375
Well, I mean, it's just--

608
00:27:03,417 --> 00:27:05,375
it's not just you and me
anymore, you know?

609
00:27:05,417 --> 00:27:08,041
Wait. Ad-Addison isn't--
she--

610
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:10,458
Addison is my best friend.

611
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,917
And, uh...

612
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:14,667
Well, the fact
that you chose her...

613
00:27:14,709 --> 00:27:17,792
I-I could pretend
that it doesn't hurt,

614
00:27:17,834 --> 00:27:19,792
and I think I do
a pretty good job--

615
00:27:19,834 --> 00:27:23,500
not all the time,
but given the circumstances.

616
00:27:25,542 --> 00:27:27,041
It...

617
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:28,542
Still hurts, Sam.

618
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:31,542
And as much
as we have a history

619
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:35,041
and Maya and, uh...
I love you.

620
00:27:35,083 --> 00:27:37,125
I just...

621
00:27:37,166 --> 00:27:38,834
I don't trust you.

622
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:42,125
Well, not like
I used to.

623
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:44,041
Uh, uh, but I can try.

624
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:46,041
And I-I will try.
I mean, I am.

625
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:49,542
I'm trying. I'm trying.
It's just...

626
00:27:49,583 --> 00:27:52,792
It's--
it's just not the same.

627
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:16,166
Okay, look, uh, I know you've
all read the manuscript.

628
00:28:16,208 --> 00:28:18,959
And, um, I know that
in this latest revision,

629
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,166
some of you feel--
mischaracterized?

630
00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:23,959
Betrayed?
Blinded by
near-murderous rage?

631
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,166
Um...
No, I was gonna say

632
00:28:26,208 --> 00:28:29,417
that some of you feel like
I took some cheap shots.

633
00:28:33,208 --> 00:28:35,166
Okay, so here's
what we're gonna do--

634
00:28:35,208 --> 00:28:37,083
everybody in this room,
right now,

635
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:40,041
say the ugliest thing
you've ever thought about me.

636
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:42,500
The thing you never thought
you'd say? Say it.

637
00:28:42,542 --> 00:28:46,041
Violet, do you really think
that's a good idea?
Absolutely. Let her rip.
Whatever you--

638
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:48,208
you're condescending.
Sorry.

639
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:50,208
I just really wanted
to be first,

640
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,208
because if you tell me
to filter again,

641
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:55,041
I am gonna bludgeon you to death
with a reflex hammer.

642
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:57,625
Okay. Okay. Good.
Looks like we've started.

643
00:28:57,667 --> 00:28:59,792
You're cheap.

644
00:28:59,834 --> 00:29:03,041
Never once have I seen you
reach for the check.

645
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:06,000
Well, I-I prefer "frugal,"
but--

646
00:29:06,041 --> 00:29:08,500
you can't dance.

647
00:29:08,542 --> 00:29:11,291
I know you think you can,
but you can't.

648
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,250
Well,
that's not terrible--

649
00:29:13,291 --> 00:29:15,834
and you still play air guitar.
That is terrible.

650
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:18,041
Yes.
Yep.

651
00:29:18,083 --> 00:29:20,291
So anything? You?

652
00:29:22,667 --> 00:29:25,208
Man-child.

653
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,250
Okay.

654
00:29:29,291 --> 00:29:31,041
I'm sorry.

655
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:33,208
Truly.
I-I probably should've

656
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:36,041
gotten your permission
before I started all this,

657
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:38,333
but I'm new at this,
and, uh, and it's hard.

658
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:42,250
And I-I tried to, uh, sketch
a full picture of each of you.

659
00:29:42,291 --> 00:29:46,875
And I tried to be harder
on myself than anyone else.

660
00:29:46,917 --> 00:29:49,291
But if there is anybody
in this room

661
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:52,291
who is honestly saying that
they can't get past this,

662
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:54,709
if what I wrote
is gonna cost my relationship

663
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:57,041
with even one of you,

664
00:29:57,083 --> 00:30:00,041
then I'll tell the publisher
I can't do it.

665
00:30:00,083 --> 00:30:03,625
So you decide.

666
00:30:10,083 --> 00:30:11,667
Andi, you can see

667
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:13,667
that your sister and Jack
are worried about you.

668
00:30:13,709 --> 00:30:16,041
But you don't think
they need to be.
I'm fine.

669
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:19,000
See?
We don't need to stay.
She's not fine.

670
00:30:19,041 --> 00:30:22,166
You told me your sister
still baby's you.
Andi, you said that?

671
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:25,291
I told him
it was out of love.
She plays both sides
of the fence.

672
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:28,291
She tells everybody she's fine,
and then when she's with us,

673
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:30,041
she freaks out.
Why would I do that?

674
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:31,750
To keep your sister here.
Is that true?

675
00:30:31,792 --> 00:30:34,375
She has always resented the time
Lara spends with me.
Jack, please.

676
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:36,375
No, no. Just let him talk.
Please.

677
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:38,291
We are building
a life together.

678
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:40,125
That could include
your sister,

679
00:30:40,166 --> 00:30:43,125
but she doesn't want to share
you with me. She never has.

680
00:30:43,166 --> 00:30:46,333
I've put up with it because I
love you, but it's enough.
Jack, leave her alone!

681
00:30:46,375 --> 00:30:49,250
Open your eyes!
Don't yell at my sister!

682
00:30:49,291 --> 00:30:52,542
Gina...
Please calm down.

683
00:30:52,583 --> 00:30:54,250
Okay, enough
with the craziness--

684
00:30:54,291 --> 00:30:58,125
I hate you.
I've always hated you.
That's not true, Andi.

685
00:30:58,166 --> 00:31:00,250
My name is Gina.
No, it's not.

686
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:04,041
It was Maggie, not Gina,
who told me she hated Jack.

687
00:31:04,083 --> 00:31:06,500
You got them reversed.

688
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,041
