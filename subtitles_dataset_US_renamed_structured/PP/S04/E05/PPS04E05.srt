00:00:03,291 --> 00:00:05,083
♪ Ohhh ohhh ohhh ♪

2
00:00:13,208 --> 00:00:17,125
We're Addison and Sam.
Addisam. We're a couple.

3
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:19,500
He talks to me about feelings.
He's amazing in bed.

4
00:00:19,542 --> 00:00:22,375
He cooks for me. Food.

5
00:00:22,417 --> 00:00:26,000
Yeah, he's perfect.
I'm perfect with him. Addisam.

6
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:27,792
She's freaking out.
Ignore her.

7
00:00:27,834 --> 00:00:29,208
Addisam.
I can't just ignore--

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,041
say something
shrinky, then.

9
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:33,667
Uh, being a-- a happy couple
is a healthy thing.

10
00:00:33,709 --> 00:00:36,041
What's wrong with him?
He has no flaws.

11
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:38,000
Well, he knows you.
You know him.

12
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:39,667
There's love.
You have a good foundation.

13
00:00:39,709 --> 00:00:42,458
Is that a metaphor or like
floorboards and a basement?

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,875
No, like he knows how to commit.
Like Pete knows how to commit.

15
00:00:44,917 --> 00:00:46,625
It's a good thing.
Really? Because in my--

16
00:00:46,667 --> 00:00:48,041
shut up, bitches.

17
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:51,750
I need to get laid.
I need to get laid really bad.

18
00:00:51,792 --> 00:00:53,625
So bad I am gonna run naked
through the streets

19
00:00:53,667 --> 00:00:55,709
and grind a cop if something
doesn't happen soon.

20
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,041
Will one of you
just lie on top of me

21
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:59,792
and rub around
for like ten minutes?

22
00:00:59,834 --> 00:01:02,500
I thought you and Mark Sloan--
that was weeks ago.

23
00:01:02,542 --> 00:01:06,000
Which in sex years
is like a decade ago.

24
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:07,500
Where are all the men
in this city?

25
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:10,041
Sheldon is single.

26
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:13,166
Do you hate me or something?

27
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:18,041
Sheldon is smart,
thoughtful, charming,

28
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:19,875
and great in bed.

29
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,917
Really?
Really?

30
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,000
Oh, morning, ladies.

31
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,041
What?
Violet: Nothing, nothing.

32
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:33,291
I was just coming to find you.
Ready to go?

33
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:38,000
Security at the prison can--
can be a bit of a pain.

34
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:47,041
All right, look,
I know it's not sex,

35
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:49,041
but come watch me
deliver a baby.

36
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:50,834
Miracle of life,
always reaffirming.

37
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:51,959
Always puts me
in a good mood.

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,041
Sheldon?

39
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:55,083
Really?

40
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:56,959
It's always the quiet ones.

41
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,000
What do you think about
starting a family?

42
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:08,500
Now?

43
00:02:08,542 --> 00:02:12,709
Not now, but soon.
We're engaged.

44
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,667
These are the kinds of things
that engaged people discuss.

45
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:19,000
How can you be thinking about
babies when we're doing this?

46
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,041
You do know that this is how
babies get made, right?

47
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,083
Not the way I do it.

48
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:28,375
Okay. I'm serious. We--

49
00:02:28,417 --> 00:02:30,875
we do wanna have kids
of our own, right?

50
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:32,500
Can we talk about this later?

51
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:37,041
Babies are a wonderful gift.

52
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:39,750
They're god's
little creatures.

53
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:42,333
We should totally
discuss this later.

54
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:46,208
Sheldon:
Okay, I'm seeing five inmates,
you're seeing two.

55
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,000
You're just there
to assess the inmates,

56
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,917
give your recommendation
to the parole board.

57
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:51,208
You're not there
to make nice.

58
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,750
So no flirting
with the inmates?

59
00:02:52,792 --> 00:02:55,125
You're making light, but these
are hardcore criminals, Violet.

60
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:57,041
They're persuasive
and charming

61
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,625
and good at getting you to think
that they're not criminals.

62
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:03,083
So just stay on your side
of the table. Be professional.

63
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,041
Violet:
Don't accept anything
from a prisoner,

64
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:07,125
don't offer to do anything
for a prisoner.

65
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,041
Relax, I read the file.
I got it.

66
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:10,333
All right.

67
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:13,125
I'm fine.
I'm a big girl.

68
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,834
I love you, Tracy.
You're doing a great job.

69
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:20,041
I love you too.
How are we doing?

70
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,542
Looking good.
The baby's starting to crown.

71
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,041
I can see her head.

72
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:26,041
Oh, you hear that, honey?
You can see Kyla's head.

73
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,667
She's gonna be beautiful
just like you.

74
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:30,417
Honey, could you not
put the camera--?

75
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:31,750
Please, don't film my--

76
00:03:31,792 --> 00:03:32,834
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

77
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,041
Okay, you guys
are the nicest couple

78
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,041
I have ever seen in a delivery.

79
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,542
All right, we're almost there,
Tracy.

80
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,041
Just one more push. Ready?

81
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,834
Push.

82
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:41,917
Good. Almost there.

83
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:43,250
Here comes Kyla.

84
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,792
I'll get oxygen
and an intubation tray.

85
00:03:49,834 --> 00:03:51,542
I'll set up the ultrasound.

86
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:55,667
She's not crying.
Why--? Why isn't she crying?

87
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:56,875
Is something wrong?

88
00:03:56,917 --> 00:03:58,458
She's just having
some trouble breathing.

89
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,250
I just wanna get her over here
and take a look.

90
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,875
Addison:
Tell me it's not as bad
as I think.

91
00:04:07,917 --> 00:04:11,000
How can someone this small
have a tumor this big?

92
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,834
Okay, Mr. Cartwright.

93
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:18,041
You have completed 40 years
of a 50-year sentence

94
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,458
for murder
and armed robbery.

95
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,083
Well, I guess we both know
what's in here, right?

96
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,542
Why don't we
just talk instead?

97
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,875
Tell me about your
rehabilitation.

98
00:04:27,917 --> 00:04:29,250
What do you wanna know?

99
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,041
Do you feel changed
for the better?

100
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,417
I'm definitely
a different man.

101
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:33,625
And what about remorse?

102
00:04:33,667 --> 00:04:35,083
Do you feel sorry
for what you did?

103
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,083
I think about what I did
every day.

104
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,458
So you feel ready
for the outside,

105
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,041
ready to rejoin society?

106
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,375
Can I say something, ma'am?

107
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,041
Dr. Turner.
Violet Turner.

108
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,875
Dr. Turner,
I've been up for parole twice.

109
00:04:48,917 --> 00:04:50,709
And each time a therapist
just like you

110
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,250
asks me the same list
of questions

111
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,375
and I end up saying
what I need to say

112
00:04:54,417 --> 00:04:56,041
to get the result
I need to get.

113
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,333
But you seem like a nice lady.
I'm not gonna waste your time.

114
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,583
I'm gonna be honest with you.

115
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,041
I'm a model prisoner.

116
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,583
I've never had
a major write-up.

117
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,792
I've worked in the mail room
30 years.

118
00:05:05,834 --> 00:05:07,917
I've co-led classes
in anger management

119
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,041
and taught young prisoners
how to read.

120
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,667
I'm proud of that,

121
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:14,041
but I know none of that's
gonna mean anything

122
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,709
once I get outside these walls.

123
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,291
I've lived more of my life
locked up than free.

124
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:22,041
I'm old.

125
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,291
And if released,

126
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:26,333
I'll get swallowed up
out there and I know that.

127
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:29,917
But here in prison,
I feel at home.

128
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:33,041
It's where my friends are,
my life is.

129
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,667
So I'm asking you...

130
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,959
To lie to the parole board.

131
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Tell them that I'm dangerous,
unremorseful, and get me denied.

132
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,375
Do whatever you have to do,
but, please,

133
00:05:48,417 --> 00:05:51,083
help me stay in prison.

134
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,750
It's remarkable.
And so intricate.

135
00:06:01,792 --> 00:06:02,875
I mean, in just ten weeks,

136
00:06:02,917 --> 00:06:04,250
it has partially compressed
the lung

137
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:06,250
and attached
to the major vessels.

138
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,041
Don't sound so gleeful.

139
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,709
Well, I'm sorry, it's just...

140
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:12,542
It's a beautiful tumor.

141
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:15,458
Sam?
It's a pleuropulmonary blastoma.

142
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,041
It's putting pressure
on the heart.

143
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,166
Amelia:
What are you gonna do?

144
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,041
It's a 12-hour surgery
and I need some help

145
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:23,041
separating it from the cardiac
vessels. You in?

146
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,583
Yeah, sure. We should probably
get Charlotte on the horn.

147
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:29,041
Start gathering the best team,
oncologist--

148
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,917
Daniel and Tracy
were so excited.

149
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:32,041
They're like the perfect couple.

150
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:35,041
I just hate
to shatter their world.

151
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:38,041
Well, that's the thing
about perfect.

152
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,000
Doesn't exist.

153
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:48,709
How was convict day?

154
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,250
Convict day?

155
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:52,875
Talking to prisoners about their
parole. You know, with Sheldon?

156
00:06:52,917 --> 00:06:54,041
The state gives us a bundle.

157
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,041
Do you listen when I talk to you
in the morning?

158
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,208
I do. I listen closely.

159
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,458
You never said anything about
working with convicts.

160
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,625
Oh, well, I don't know.
Maybe I forgot.

161
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:05,917
Anyway, the point is
that my prisoner wants me

162
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:09,333
to lie to the parole board
and have him denied.

163
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,041
He wants to stay in prison.

164
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:12,625
Why?

165
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:14,041
He's old. It's home.

166
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,667
Good. You're done. Case closed.

167
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:18,083
No, not-- not done.
Not closed.

168
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,333
How can I just leave a man
in prison?

169
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:21,500
Just let him
stay in a system

170
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:23,500
when he clearly
doesn't belong there.

171
00:07:23,542 --> 00:07:25,500
Doesn't this strike you
as so, so sad?

172
00:07:25,542 --> 00:07:27,917
Not really.
Why is everyone here so callous?

173
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:30,083
Everyone's not--
we gave Betsey away.

174
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,875
Dell's child.
Our dead friend's child.

175
00:07:32,917 --> 00:07:34,625
We put her in the system too.

176
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:36,250
This isn't about Betsey.

177
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:39,375
I know.

178
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,875
So, what is your problem?

179
00:07:40,917 --> 00:07:43,917
You're my wife,
the mother of my child.

180
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:46,041
You were brutally attacked
by someone

181
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,125
who is now in the system.

182
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:50,291
So forgive me if I feel
a little callous.

183
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,333
Forgive me for caring.

184
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:04,750
You should feel like crap.

185
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:06,208
Oh, shut up.

186
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,709
What do you think about me
and Charlotte having kids?

187
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,834
Is Charlotte pregnant?

188
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,083
No.

189
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,125
Uh, but, you know,
she will be one day and...

190
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:16,709
We'd have cute kids, right?

191
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,959
So now you want a child?

192
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,625
This really
isn't about Betsey.

193
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,125
Okay, fine.

194
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:28,750
Well, uh, does Charlotte feel
like she's ready to be a mother?

195
00:08:28,792 --> 00:08:31,375
We're, um, still talking.

196
00:08:31,417 --> 00:08:34,291
Good. That's good.

197
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:35,542
Yeah.

198
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,291
Wow, Charlotte with kids.

199
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,041
I never thought, um...

200
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:42,208
Well, that's good
that you're talking.

201
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,041
Isn't she too young
for surgery?

202
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:50,959
The surgery is risky.
Every surgery is.

203
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,875
But we've got the best surgical
team assembled

204
00:08:52,917 --> 00:08:55,041
and I'm confident
about their abilities.

205
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,208
Uh, Dr. Rodriguez,
meet Dr. Addison Montgomery.

206
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,875
How do you do?

207
00:08:58,917 --> 00:09:00,500
Charlotte:
Daniel and Tracy woods.

208
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:02,125
Dr. Rodriguez is the oncologist.

209
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,166
He'll be part of the team
working to treat Kyla.

210
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,041
I know this is a rough time
for you,

211
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:09,041
but we're going to do everything
in our power to save your baby.

212
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,458
Charlotte:
You're actually on time.

213
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,000
We were just discussing
surgery.

214
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,458
Surgery?

215
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,041
Have you discussed chemo
as an alternative to surgery?

216
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,083
Yes, but I believe surgery
will be more effective.

217
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,667
Only if she survives.

218
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:22,291
Chemo's better than surgery?
Rodriguez: In my opinion.

219
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:25,250
Based on the ct,
Kyla has a type two ppb tumor.

220
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,667
Chemo is the treatment
of choice.

221
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:28,083
It's less invasive and risky.

222
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,709
I disagree.
I've seen the ct too.

223
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,875
I believe that Kyla
has a classic type one tumor.

224
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:34,625
Removing the tumor
will cure her.

225
00:09:34,667 --> 00:09:36,667
I can tell you about
the advantages of chemo.

226
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:38,000
Excuse me--

227
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,083
maybe we should
step outside, doctors.

228
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,875
If you two wanna gunsling,
do it out here,

229
00:09:46,917 --> 00:09:48,250
not in front of the family.

230
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:50,291
Chemo is the standard,
proven method of treatment.

231
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:51,750
You'd say that.
You're a cancer doc.

232
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:53,041
Chemo is all you do.

233
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:55,041
Of course you'd go against it.
You're a surgeon.

234
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,083
Cutting is all you do.

235
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,083
The goal here is to figure out
what makes sense,

236
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,834
not argue.
No way is it necessary

237
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:02,959
to do surgery now when there's
another viable, safer option.

238
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,500
It's safer to put a baby through
months and months of chemo

239
00:10:05,542 --> 00:10:07,041
and watch it suffer?
That's safer?

240
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,291
If we can reduce the mass
and shrink the cancer cells,

241
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,041
it will make doing the surgery
later easier.

242
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,083
There's no guarantee chemo
is gonna remove the tumor.

243
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:15,333
Guarantee that with surgery?
Yes, I can,

244
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:16,750
or I wouldn't be standing here.

245
00:10:16,792 --> 00:10:18,041
We don't make guarantees.

246
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,250
One surgery cures this baby

247
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,834
and she never has to see
a hospital again.

248
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:25,041
And you get to be the hero.
Yes, Dr. Rodriguez.

249
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,583
That's usually how it goes.

250
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,500
You're the chief.
It's your call.

251
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:31,709
The parents have obviously
put their trust

252
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,917
in Dr. Montgomery's judgment.
So have I.

253
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:35,500
We're doing the surgery.
Daniel: Help!

254
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,291
We need help in here.
Something's wrong with Tracy.

255
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,917
She's hemorrhaging.
I need two large-bore ivs

256
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,250
and an lr wide open.
I'll get them.

257
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,375
Pulse is racing.
She's hypertensive.

258
00:10:46,417 --> 00:10:49,000
Type and cross two units.
And I need an O.R. now.

259
00:10:52,542 --> 00:10:54,542
It was a postpartum hemorrhage.
It happens.

260
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:57,000
I was able to control
the bleeding.

261
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,667
She'll wake up soon.
We just have to give her time.

262
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,417
You date,
you get married.

263
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:09,792
You never even think
that something bad might happen.

264
00:11:09,834 --> 00:11:12,417
We've never had any kind
of problems and now...

265
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:17,750
Now my entire family's in danger
and they're depending on me.

266
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,500
What am I supposed to do?
You sit down and you wait

267
00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:25,542
for your wife to wake up,
because she will.

268
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:28,000
And then you let me take care
of Kyla.

269
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,000
Sheldon:
What are you gonna do?

270
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,041
I don't know.
Violet, you can't--

271
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:49,041
I know, I know. It's just...

272
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,458
Lewis has been locked up
for four decades.

273
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,041
He doesn't have any family,
doesn't have any support system.

274
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,458
He's got no one.

275
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,667
This isn't about Betsey.

276
00:11:56,709 --> 00:11:59,792
I know.
Why does everyone keep--?

277
00:11:59,834 --> 00:12:01,041
I know.
Do you?

278
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:04,041
How is he gonna make
a new life for himself

279
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,625
after being locked up
for so long?

280
00:12:05,667 --> 00:12:09,041
I mean, he went to prison
in 1970. Nixon was president.

281
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:12,583
There were no computers or cell
phones or freaking microwaves.

282
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:16,041
Prisoners reenter society
every day. They don't all fail.

283
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,041
You know?
He could make it.

284
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,875
But how are people
gonna treat him?

285
00:12:18,917 --> 00:12:20,625
You tell someone
you've done time in prison,

286
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:22,041
I don't care
how liberal they are.

287
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,041
They walk the other way.
Lewis is a man.

288
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,291
A man who made a mistake.

289
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,667
But he owes it to himself to
get out there and make a life.

290
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:29,458
And he deserves a chance
to do that,

291
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,583
even if he doesn't want to.

292
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,208
I have to get to the prison,

293
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,208
talk to the board.
Violet,

294
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,041
I'm gonna say the same thing
I said about Betsey.

295
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,041
Don't lose
all your objectivity.

296
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:41,375
Don't get attached.
Just do what you know is right.

297
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,083
Is she awake yet?
Not yet.

298
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,333
But Daniel still wants
to go ahead with Kyla's surgery,

299
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,041
so we're gonna do it.

300
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,250
Oh, Daniel, I was just coming
to talk to you.

301
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:52,500
This is Dr. Sam Bennett.

302
00:12:52,542 --> 00:12:54,041
He'll be assisting me
with the surgery.

303
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:57,250
Well, actually that won't be
necessary anymore.

304
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,041
See, I spoke with that
oncologist again

305
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:02,041
and I'm going with the chemo.

306
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,041
Daniel, you have every right
to change your mind,

307
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,041
but I really think
that this is a decision

308
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,709
that you and Tracy
need to make together.

309
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,041
My wife is unconscious
and my baby has a tumor.

310
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,250
So I'm not into
taking any risks right now.

311
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,500
So no, I made the decision
for us both.

312
00:13:14,542 --> 00:13:16,041
I think trac--
Dr. Montgomery,

313
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:17,333
I won't be needing
your opinion.

314
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,709
Dr. King knows about this.
She gave me her full support.

315
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,041
So you can
stay out of it for now.

316
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,625
Thank you.

317
00:13:36,417 --> 00:13:39,875
Great. No messages.

318
00:13:39,917 --> 00:13:41,375
Any of your patients
need brain surgery?

319
00:13:41,417 --> 00:13:43,500
Nope.

320
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:48,166
You used to date Sheldon.

321
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:52,041
Date is strong word.
I used to screw Sheldon.

322
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,583
And would you recommend him?

323
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,875
And he knows
what to do with it.

324
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:13,125
Morning.
Afternoon.

325
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,625
There's plenty of coffee
in the kitchen.

326
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:20,000
You don't
have to go downstairs.

327
00:14:21,667 --> 00:14:23,125
We should work together.

328
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,458
I've heard about your skills.

329
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,667
I bet you could
teach me something.

330
00:14:26,709 --> 00:14:29,291
You're talking
about therapy?

331
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,834
And other things.

332
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:38,333
Did you see that?

333
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,041
What?
Amelia.

334
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,875
She was checking me out
like a piece of meat.

335
00:14:41,917 --> 00:14:44,041
Amelia is young
and hot and, uh...

336
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,458
That's a lot of woman.

337
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,417
Yeah, well,
I can get women, Cooper.

338
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:50,417
I didn't--
I've had lots of women.

339
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,041
Just saying.
I can handle it.

340
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:55,000
Okay. Excuse me.

341
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,083
Where the hell is the coffee?

342
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,375
Just talk to Charlotte.

343
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:06,792
Maybe she can explain.

344
00:15:06,834 --> 00:15:08,625
What's with all the noise?

345
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:10,834
So from complete faith in me
to totally shutting me out?

346
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,834
What did you do?
Did you lock the dad in the room

347
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,917
with that jackass oncologist
so he could convince him

348
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,667
to do the chemo
while Tracy's unconscious?

349
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:17,792
Charlotte:
Are you done?

350
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,875
Because once you stop talking,
I can.

351
00:15:19,917 --> 00:15:22,083
Who wins, Venus or Serena?
Both: Shut up, Cooper.

352
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:24,625
First, I don't have to explain
anything to you.

353
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:26,917
It's my hospital.
I do what I want.

354
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,250
Second, my responsibility
is to the parents.

355
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,750
And the baby,
the actual patient here.

356
00:15:31,792 --> 00:15:33,208
I'm not done talking.

357
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,834
Third, the man's been holding
vigil by his wife's bedside

358
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,083
while his baby
lays in an Incubator.

359
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,083
He didn't need
much convincing.

360
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,333
Although you wanna believe
big bad bitch Charlotte

361
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,208
shut everything down,
I didn't.

362
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,750
One parent made a decision and
I am obligated to enforce it.

363
00:15:46,792 --> 00:15:48,542
Which means the father
has spoken,

364
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:51,041
the surgery is off
and I am done with this.

365
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,250
Oh, you know what, Charlotte?
I'm not done.

366
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:56,000
Let her go. Breathe.

367
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,917
Lewis is 70,
but his life is not over.

368
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:15,041
He is smart. He is strong.
He can make it.

369
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,375
There is life outside of prison

370
00:16:17,417 --> 00:16:19,500
and Lewis should
be a part of it.

371
00:16:19,542 --> 00:16:22,625
I believe he is ready
to be a part of it.

372
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,750
Lewis Cartwright
is not a threat to society.

373
00:16:25,792 --> 00:16:28,959
In fact, if released, I believe
he'd be a model citizen.

374
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,041
What are you doing here?

375
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:13,458
I'm here to help.

376
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,000
You've done enough, thanks.

377
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,000
Lewis, please, hear me out.

378
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:26,000
Who is Addison to be questioning
my motives anyway?

379
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:28,041
What, is she
the motive police?

380
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:29,667
I don't have to explain
anything to her.

381
00:17:29,709 --> 00:17:32,250
I mean, last time I checked,
my mama lived in Alabama.

382
00:17:33,709 --> 00:17:35,041
What?

383
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm just waiting
for you to finish.

384
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,667
Say what's on your mind,
Cooper.

385
00:17:40,709 --> 00:17:43,041
You don't fight fair.

386
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,166
You don't listen
to the other side, Charlotte.

387
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,709
You don't hear people out,
you don't answer questions.

388
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,291
When you wanna
get out of something--

389
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,667
what are you talking about?
With Addison, you just walk away

390
00:17:51,709 --> 00:17:53,250
and with me, you use sex.

391
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:56,041
You have a problem with that?
Yes!

392
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,041
No.

393
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,417
Yes, we are engaged

394
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:02,917
and having a discussion
about children is important.

395
00:18:02,959 --> 00:18:05,041
In my mind, I asked you
a pretty simple question

396
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,792
that you don't wanna answer.

397
00:18:06,834 --> 00:18:09,041
I told you we'd discuss it
later. What's the big damn deal?

398
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,041
Why? Why later?

399
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,291
No! See, this is what
I'm talking about.

400
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,458
Okay, I'm gonna finish this.
You can't dig your heels in

401
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,083
when you don't like
the conversation,

402
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,750
say "later," and walk away.

403
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,875
Yeah. At least I finished.

404
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,667
What happened to just coffee?

405
00:18:28,709 --> 00:18:30,542
Everything's fancier now.

406
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:34,208
I haven't had to choose
what to eat in 40 years.

407
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,250
You know, if it helps, I usually
narrow it down to two choices

408
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:41,125
and then I just choose one
from there.

409
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,417
I'll have eggs and bacon.

410
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,291
Do you have
a place to live?

411
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,792
I got the name
of a probation officer

412
00:18:47,834 --> 00:18:50,041
who's gonna set me up
at a halfway house.

413
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,166
The prison gave me
two pairs of pants and a shirt

414
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,083
and a couple hundred bucks.

415
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,500
I'm thinking it's not enough,
but it's a start.

416
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,875
I-- I made some calls too,
and I found a job for you.

417
00:19:08,917 --> 00:19:11,041
It's just something
part-time at a car wash

418
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,333
until you get
back on your feet.

419
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,041
What do I owe you?
Nothing.

420
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:16,041
That's not the way it works
where I come from.

421
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,041
Somebody do you a favor,
they expect one back.

422
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,750
Well, that world
is behind you now.

423
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:22,291
You're a free man.

424
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:27,125
Lewis:
I feel like I've been dropped
into some foreign country

425
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,166
and I should speak the language,
but I don't.

426
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,959
It's gonna take a while
to adjust, Lewis.

427
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,709
But you will.

428
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,291
Come see me.

429
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:40,333
We can work together
to help you to transition.

430
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:43,709
Okay? I can help you make it,
Lewis.

431
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,959
I'm here to do
a repeat blood count.

432
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
We start chemo
in the morning.

433
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,041
She's all yours.
I know this isn't your choice,

434
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,041
but I really think
it's going to work.

435
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,041
Doesn't matter
what you think.

436
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,667
Daniel and Tracy came in
thinking

437
00:20:13,709 --> 00:20:15,709
they were gonna have
a healthy baby and they didn't.

438
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,291
Now everything's a mess.

439
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:26,041
I didn't peg you
as a pessimist.

440
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,250
What?

441
00:20:30,667 --> 00:20:34,667
Last month, I had to tell
three families about relapses.

442
00:20:34,709 --> 00:20:36,875
I lost my favorite patient.

443
00:20:36,917 --> 00:20:40,000
But then there was
this one woman with lymphoma

444
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,417
who walked out
of those doors.

445
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:45,834
That's how it happens. You focus
on the good, on the one.

446
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:48,875
Not on the bad.

447
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,667
Tracy woods. She's awake.

448
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,625
I have two highs.

449
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:08,458
Cutting into people's brains
and sex.

450
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,125
When I can't have one,
I search for the other.

451
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:14,000
And right now nobody's brain
needs cutting into.

452
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:18,041
You're propositioning me
for sex?

453
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,458
Yeah.

454
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,041
I'll think about it.

455
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,667
Excuse me?

456
00:21:25,709 --> 00:21:27,792
I'll think about it.

457
00:21:42,417 --> 00:21:45,375
I wanna see Kyla.

458
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:46,792
How is she?

459
00:21:46,834 --> 00:21:48,750
She's doing as well
as can be expected.

460
00:21:48,792 --> 00:21:51,750
Tracy, I wanted to talk to you
about the surgery.

461
00:21:51,792 --> 00:21:53,166
Did you already do it?

462
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:54,458
Daniel didn't tell you?

463
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,917
Tell me what?

464
00:21:55,959 --> 00:21:57,417
Daniel:
Honey, I called the family and--

465
00:21:58,834 --> 00:21:59,750
what are you doing here?

466
00:21:59,792 --> 00:22:02,000
She's our doctor.

467
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:04,166
Daniel decided
to go with the chemo.

468
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:05,667
Chemo?

469
00:22:05,709 --> 00:22:08,917
But Dr. Montgomery said
she could remove the tumor.

470
00:22:08,959 --> 00:22:12,917
Maybe. Honey, maybe she can
remove the whole tumor.

471
00:22:12,959 --> 00:22:14,500
All right, that oncologist,

472
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:17,041
he told me that Kyla
is too weak for surgery.

473
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:18,583
And-- and you agree with this?

474
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,083
No, I don't.

475
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:23,041
You can't just make
this decision without me.

476
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:25,500
You know, I just don't want
our baby to die.

477
00:22:25,542 --> 00:22:27,083
And I do? I'm her mother.

478
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:28,166
Yeah, and I'm her father.

479
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:30,125
Okay, the time
that you waste arguing

480
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:32,083
is time that Kyla
is not being treated.

481
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:34,625
You need to make a decision.
What do you both wanna do?

482
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:36,166
I told you, the chemo.

483
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:37,583
No. No.

484
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:51,041
Look, there's only two ways
for this to end.

485
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:52,542
Either one of them
goes to court

486
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:55,041
and gets medical
power of attorney or...

487
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,834
Or we get them
on the same page.

488
00:22:57,875 --> 00:23:01,083
Okay, well, I can try
and talk to Daniel.

489
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:03,834
What?

490
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:06,041
Nothing.

491
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:08,375
Have I told you how beautiful
you look in the morning?

492
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:17,667
Okay, okay. Enough with the lips
and the hands.

493
00:23:17,709 --> 00:23:19,500
Okay.

494
00:23:19,542 --> 00:23:20,500
You're freaking out and--

495
00:23:20,542 --> 00:23:23,041
if you touch me,
I can't think.

496
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:25,458
You're too sexy.
Just be ugly or something.

497
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,834
Ugh, woman.

498
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:28,917
Okay, look, I know...

499
00:23:28,959 --> 00:23:30,834
All right,
I'm just gonna say this.

500
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:33,208
And I know that it's gonna make
me sound like a crazy woman,

501
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:37,667
but us, you, me, the addisam,
you know, it's just not...

502
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,417
All right.

503
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:46,583
Usually in a relationship,

504
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:49,709
I can see ahead and see
how things are gonna go wrong.

505
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:52,667
You know, I'm usually five
moves ahead or 15 moves ahead

506
00:23:52,709 --> 00:23:54,083
and I can see
where it's gonna fall apart

507
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:56,041
or where the guy
is gonna disappoint me

508
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:59,083
or where he's gonna break
my heart or--

509
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:03,208
but you're perfect.
You have no flaws.

510
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:06,417
And I can't see ahead
and it's making me crazy.

511
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:08,291
Nothing is going
to break us up.

512
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:11,041
Don't say that. That's perfect.
You just said the perfect thing.

513
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:13,083
Daniel and Tracy
thought that.

514
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:16,041
Now they're ripping each other
apart over their baby.

515
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:17,875
What do you want me to say?
I don't know.

516
00:24:17,917 --> 00:24:20,041
Just try not to be perfect.

517
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:23,375
Okay. Ahem. How about this?
I'm not perfect.

518
00:24:23,417 --> 00:24:27,000
I'm just perfect for you.

519
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:32,542
See?

520
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:34,125
Now I'm gonna have to tear
your clothes off

521
00:24:34,166 --> 00:24:35,667
and have my way with you.

522
00:24:35,709 --> 00:24:39,041
Because that was the exact
perfect thing.

523
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:40,500
Okay.

524
00:24:45,834 --> 00:24:47,875
Sheldon turned me down
for sex.

525
00:24:47,917 --> 00:24:50,250
I figured he would feel like
he won the lotto.

526
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:52,166
Instead he looks me straight
in the face and says--

527
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:53,917
"I'll think about it."

528
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:55,583
How did you know?
Wild guess.

529
00:24:55,625 --> 00:24:56,792
It's probably not as good

530
00:24:56,834 --> 00:24:58,125
as I think it's gonna be anyway,
so...

531
00:24:58,166 --> 00:25:00,583
It is.

532
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:02,166
It's better.

533
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:05,041
Damn it.

534
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:07,583
The whole,
"let me think about it"?

535
00:25:07,625 --> 00:25:09,291
That's pure Sheldon.
That's his game.

536
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:12,208
And from looking at you,
it's working like a charm.

537
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:18,333
Hey.
Hey.

538
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:19,917
What you looking for?

539
00:25:19,959 --> 00:25:23,500
He hasn't called.
Who?

540
00:25:23,542 --> 00:25:26,959
Lewis, the parolee.

541
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I told him to come see me.
I hoped he would call.

542
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:32,667
I'm worried.
He's out there by himself.

543
00:25:32,709 --> 00:25:35,458
Well, I'm sure he has access to
people, resources who can help.

544
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,250
Okay, look, i--
I know you don't like the idea

545
00:25:38,291 --> 00:25:40,417
of me working with a prisoner
because of Katie,

546
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:42,834
but I'm good.
I'm not afraid.

547
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,333
So worry about Lewis,
not about me.

548
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:45,458
He's a murderer, Violet.

549
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,208
And that means--?

550
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,542
He can't be rehabilitated.
How could you even say that?

551
00:25:49,583 --> 00:25:51,959
My life's work is based on the
belief that people can change.

552
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,041
I see it every day.

553
00:25:53,083 --> 00:25:54,875
I say this out of concern
for you.

554
00:25:54,917 --> 00:25:56,250
Don't get involved.

555
00:25:56,291 --> 00:25:58,792
The world's a better place
without people like Lewis.

556
00:25:58,834 --> 00:26:00,542
Okay, I know you're trying
to take care of me,

557
00:26:00,583 --> 00:26:02,041
but this is pissing me off.

558
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:05,083
We care. That's our job.
That's who we are.

559
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:08,041
And this,
what you're saying right now,

560
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:10,000
it doesn't even sound like you.

561
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:29,291
Daniel:
This will be Kyla one day,
right?

562
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:32,667
Happy, healthy.
Yeah, we hope.

563
00:26:37,917 --> 00:26:40,458
My baby's lying in an Incubator
with a big tumor in her body

564
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,750
and we're out here fighting.

565
00:26:43,792 --> 00:26:48,458
If Kyla doesn't make it,

566
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,083
Tracy's not gonna be able
to live with that,

567
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:51,542
and I cannot lose them both.

568
00:26:51,583 --> 00:26:52,750
You don't have to.

569
00:26:52,792 --> 00:26:53,875
That's easy for you to say.

570
00:26:53,917 --> 00:26:56,417
Actually it's not.

571
00:26:56,458 --> 00:26:58,125
I know why you wanna
make the safe choice.

572
00:26:58,166 --> 00:27:00,208
No parent wants
to see their child

573
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:04,041
go behind those operating room
doors and not come out alive.

574
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:07,291
The waiting feels like
it's gonna kill you.

575
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:11,041
But there comes a time
when you need

576
00:27:11,083 --> 00:27:14,000
to put your trust
in each other

577
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:18,291
and make a decision together
as parents.

578
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:19,542
Right or wrong.

579
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:26,375
You want that,
do the surgery.

580
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:42,583
If I stop, I'll get fired.

581
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:43,917
I-- I hadn't heard from you

582
00:27:43,959 --> 00:27:45,709
and I just wanted to make sure
that you were okay.

583
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,542
I'm making it.

584
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,709
I gave you my card
and I was hoping that--

585
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,625
I tossed it.
Hey, look, I'm working here.

586
00:27:52,667 --> 00:27:54,291
Lewis, I'm sorry.
I'm not here to harass you.

587
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:55,291
I just wanted to--

588
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:57,625
help? You said that.

589
00:27:57,667 --> 00:27:59,458
Look, I don't need a handout.

590
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:03,333
Well, how about a hand up?

591
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:05,750
Look, i--

592
00:28:05,792 --> 00:28:08,041
I've been through things myself
and I know how hard it can be.

593
00:28:08,083 --> 00:28:10,291
So I just-- I want you to know
that I mean it.

594
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:11,959
Here. Keep it this time.

595
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,041
Leave and don't come back.

596
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:17,041
But--
you don't know me.

597
00:28:17,083 --> 00:28:19,458
I could do things to you to make
you regret you ever met me.

598
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,875
So for your own good,

599
00:28:20,917 --> 00:28:23,750
I would leave and stay
as far away from me as possible.

600
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,458
Why do you have my child?

601
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,583
I hijacked him
from the nanny.

602
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:49,417
God, he's growing.

603
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:56,250
I think I might
have messed up with Lewis.

604
00:28:56,291 --> 00:28:58,041
Who's that, the prison guy?
Why do you say that?

605
00:28:58,083 --> 00:29:00,333
He threatened me.

606
00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:02,041
And that is just
between you and me, okay?

607
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:05,041
Pete saying "I told you so"
is not what I need right now.

608
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:07,041
Yeah, but you need to walk away.
You've done enough.

609
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:08,667
Let the guy
make his own way.

610
00:29:08,709 --> 00:29:09,709
I am. I'm done.

611
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:15,291
You think I wanna save this guy
because I couldn't save Betsey?

612
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:17,291
Do you?

613
00:29:22,709 --> 00:29:24,125
It's like looking
into the sun.

614
00:29:25,917 --> 00:29:27,041
So gorgeous it hurts.

615
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:32,125
Charlotte is acting weird
about the baby thing.

616
00:29:32,166 --> 00:29:34,041
What if she never wants kids?

617
00:29:34,083 --> 00:29:36,041
Well, you can hijack Lucas
whenever you want.

618
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:37,208
Preferably Friday nights,

619
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,083
so I can have sex
with my hot cranky husband.

620
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:42,041
Don't talk about sex
in front of the kid.

621
00:29:42,083 --> 00:29:43,500
He'll end up impotent.

622
00:29:43,542 --> 00:29:46,041
Or I will.

623
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:48,000
Motherhood is scary.

624
00:29:50,083 --> 00:29:51,625
She'll come around.

625
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:55,875
Addison:
The tumor is even larger

626
00:29:55,917 --> 00:29:58,542
and more intertwined
than on the ct.

627
00:29:58,583 --> 00:30:01,041
Sam:
Maybe debulk as best you can
and get out for now.

628
00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:03,750
Addison:
No. I promised I could get it.

629
00:30:05,083 --> 00:30:06,500
Metz.
Nurse: Here you go.

630
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,750
Sam:
Whoa. The tumor invaded
the artery. It perfed.

631
00:30:10,792 --> 00:30:13,542
Addison:
Satinsky. I need to clamp
the vessel.

632
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:17,041
I can't get it.

633
00:30:18,709 --> 00:30:20,417
She's hypovolemic.
We lost her pulse.

634
00:30:36,083 --> 00:30:37,208
We got the whole tumor.

635
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:39,041
It's gone?
Yes.

636
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:41,041
Her lung is fine
and so is her heart.

637
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:45,250
Would you like
to see Kyla now?

638
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:47,875
Yes, please.

639
00:31:18,583 --> 00:31:21,041
In and out.
That was my plan.

640
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:23,625
I was just gonna
go in the store,

641
00:31:23,667 --> 00:31:27,041
hit the register,
get some cash.

642
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:29,208
I never expected anything
to go wrong.

643
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:31,041
But when she saw my gun,

644
00:31:31,083 --> 00:31:32,959
she started screaming
and screaming.

645
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,208
I knew she'd remember my face,
so I shot her.

646
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:39,458
Twice in the stomach.

647
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:43,250
I didn't even wait for
her body to drop. I just ran.

648
00:31:43,291 --> 00:31:47,041
She was a college girl
on her way home from school.

649
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:49,792
Just stopped for gas.

650
00:31:49,834 --> 00:31:52,875
Stephanie was her name.

651
00:31:52,917 --> 00:31:55,291
And I wonder all the time,

652
00:31:55,333 --> 00:31:58,458
what would she be doing
with her life right now?

653
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:03,625
Would she be married?
Have kids? A nice job?

654
00:32:03,667 --> 00:32:09,041
And because she died,

655
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:12,291
you don't feel like you

656
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:14,583
deserve to live your life.

657
00:32:18,333 --> 00:32:20,625
I didn't mean to scare you.
I'm sorry I did that.

658
00:32:20,667 --> 00:32:23,041
It's just that
I don't deserve anyone's help.

659
00:32:23,083 --> 00:32:24,959
Everybody deserves help, Lewis.

660
00:32:27,709 --> 00:32:29,041
I killed someone.

661
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:31,250
And you feel like
you can't forgive yourself.

662
00:32:31,291 --> 00:32:33,834
And I can never
repay it either.

663
00:32:33,875 --> 00:32:36,250
Forty years in prison,
that's enough.

664
00:32:36,291 --> 00:32:37,875
Is it?

665
00:32:37,917 --> 00:32:39,041
It has to be.

666
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:43,709
If I enjoy a cup of coffee,
I feel guilty now.

667
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:48,083
If I just sit on a park bench
and watch the trees blow,

668
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:51,041
I feel guilty
about that too.

669
00:32:51,083 --> 00:32:53,250
And now that I'm free,

670
00:32:53,291 --> 00:32:57,709
if I lose myself
in a good moment, I feel bad.

671
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:00,166
But think about all the good
things that you've done.

672
00:33:00,208 --> 00:33:02,792
All the ways that you've tried
to make amends.

673
00:33:02,834 --> 00:33:05,291
And you've done this
all the while knowing

674
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:07,375
that you can never really pay
for what you did.

675
00:33:07,417 --> 00:33:10,750
You helped
other prisoners.

676
00:33:10,792 --> 00:33:12,709
You never caused trouble
for anyone else.

677
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,667
You got an education.

678
00:33:14,709 --> 00:33:16,083
You didn't just sit there
and do time.

679
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:18,709
You made something of it.

680
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:22,250
You went into prison
and you came out a better man.

681
00:33:25,542 --> 00:33:28,000
It's okay to live, Lewis.

682
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,000
Live.

683
00:33:42,792 --> 00:33:44,917
Hey, Lewis was here.

684
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:47,500
We had therapy
and he had a breakthrough.

685
00:33:47,542 --> 00:33:49,333
I believe he thinks
he can make it now.

686
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:52,041
That's great, Violet,
but be careful.

687
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:54,041
Everybody doesn't respond
to therapy.

688
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:56,375
Great. First Pete and now you.
Pete?

689
00:33:56,417 --> 00:33:58,875
He has some issue with me
working in the prison.

690
00:33:58,917 --> 00:34:02,500
Oh. Violet.
I can come back later.

691
00:34:09,417 --> 00:34:10,750
What was that?

692
00:34:10,792 --> 00:34:13,166
Psychology and brain surgery
are symbiotic disciplines

693
00:34:13,208 --> 00:34:15,458
and we were thinking
about working, um--

694
00:34:17,417 --> 00:34:19,542
okay, I'm not a good liar.

695
00:34:19,583 --> 00:34:20,959
Amelia propositioned me
for sex

696
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,625
and I haven't been able
to give her an answer.

697
00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:25,834
Ooh. What do you think
is holding you back?

698
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:29,041
Amelia and I have said
eight words to each other

699
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:30,583
since she joined
the practice.

700
00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:32,333
Why me?

701
00:34:35,959 --> 00:34:37,667
Nice, Violet. Real nice.

702
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:39,667
You've been sharing stories
with the class.

703
00:34:39,709 --> 00:34:40,917
Oh, come on.

704
00:34:40,959 --> 00:34:44,208
For most men, this would be
like a badge of honor.

705
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:03,500
She made it.

706
00:35:03,542 --> 00:35:05,208
She made it.

707
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:07,208
Congratulations.

708
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:09,000
Thank you.

709
00:35:14,166 --> 00:35:15,667
Can I buy you dinner?

710
00:35:15,709 --> 00:35:20,834
And tell you how right you were
over and over?

711
00:35:20,875 --> 00:35:22,291
I can't.

712
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,458
But-- but thank you.

713
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,542
Oh.

714
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:28,041
You probably
don't need to know this,

715
00:35:28,083 --> 00:35:30,291
but I've had a string
of unsuccessful relationships

716
00:35:30,333 --> 00:35:32,291
and now I have this amazing guy
in my life

717
00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:34,709
who does amazing things
for me and...

718
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:38,667
You...

719
00:35:38,709 --> 00:35:40,500
Well, let's just say
that I am focusing

720
00:35:40,542 --> 00:35:42,000
on the good, on the one.

721
00:35:59,542 --> 00:36:01,041
I'm not the mommy type.

722
00:36:01,083 --> 00:36:03,875
I don't like kids
and I don't want kids.

723
00:36:03,917 --> 00:36:05,166
And I'm a pediatrician.
I love kids.

724
00:36:05,208 --> 00:36:07,375
I've always wanted kids.
I need to have kids.

725
00:36:14,083 --> 00:36:16,000
They'll like you
more than they'll like me.

726
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:18,625
I'm not...

727
00:36:20,834 --> 00:36:21,834
...warm.

728
00:36:22,834 --> 00:36:24,041
They will love you.

729
00:36:24,083 --> 00:36:27,208
What if I end up
like my mother?

730
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:30,083
Drunk at noon,
hating the rug rats

731
00:36:30,125 --> 00:36:31,333
I'm supposed to love,

732
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:34,250
screwing up our kids,
damaging them.

733
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,041
See? Now you're gonna leave me.

734
00:36:38,083 --> 00:36:40,041
This is why I didn't
wanna talk about it.

735
00:36:40,083 --> 00:36:43,333
Charlotte, I'm not leaving you.
We're having the conversation.

736
00:36:43,375 --> 00:36:45,875
And you didn't walk out
and you didn't shut down

737
00:36:45,917 --> 00:36:47,417
and you didn't try
to confuse me with sex.

738
00:36:47,458 --> 00:36:50,542
We're having the conversation.

739
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:53,000
And we can keep having it.

740
00:36:54,667 --> 00:36:56,041
We don't have to decide
right now?

741
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:58,000
We don't have to decide
right now.

742
00:36:59,375 --> 00:37:00,709
What now?

743
00:37:02,875 --> 00:37:05,333
Now you can confuse me
with sex.

744
00:37:05,375 --> 00:37:07,375
Yeah?
Yes, please.

745
00:37:11,083 --> 00:37:13,000
Take your clothes off.

746
00:37:25,083 --> 00:37:26,041
I know your game.

747
00:37:26,083 --> 00:37:28,250
You perform like
a triathlete in the bedroom

748
00:37:28,291 --> 00:37:30,709
to get women in elevators
all gossiping about you.

749
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:34,041
You play the "insecure, shy,
indecisive therapist" bit.

750
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:36,583
And in the end, you're the guy
who ends up with all the girls

751
00:37:36,625 --> 00:37:38,041
and nobody
ever saw it coming.

752
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:40,458
You're horrible
at taking rejection.

753
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,458
Heh. I am not.

754
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,041
Horrible. You're the baby
of the family, right?

755
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:46,834
That's a little easy.
You know what?

756
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:48,750
I take it back.
This whole offer, i--

757
00:37:48,792 --> 00:37:50,000
let me tell you
how this would go.

758
00:38:01,834 --> 00:38:04,959
We'd sleep together and at first
it would be just for kicks,

759
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,041
but eventually
I'd fall for you hard.

760
00:38:07,083 --> 00:38:09,875
And then you would do what women
like you, the bad girls,

761
00:38:09,917 --> 00:38:11,709
the ones who like it
dirty and nasty

762
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,875
and a little bit kinky,

763
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:16,333
you know, the ones
with serious daddy issues do.

764
00:38:16,375 --> 00:38:18,375
You'd run.

765
00:38:18,417 --> 00:38:21,500
You'd avoid me. You'd be
intentionally mean to me.

766
00:38:21,542 --> 00:38:24,125
My savior complex would kick in,
so I'd chase you,

767
00:38:24,166 --> 00:38:26,792
keep calling you,
let you use me for sex

768
00:38:26,834 --> 00:38:29,041
on the nights when
you were drunk or bored.

769
00:38:29,083 --> 00:38:31,291
But you're too damaged
to appreciate the fact

770
00:38:31,333 --> 00:38:34,041
that I'm a good guy
and I could actually care.

771
00:38:34,083 --> 00:38:36,542
And then one day,
I'd show up at your apartment

772
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:40,458
with flowers or something,
trying to woo you,

773
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,250
only to find you on your couch
screwing some guy

774
00:38:42,291 --> 00:38:43,667
ten years younger than me.

775
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:47,208
Am I wrong?

776
00:38:49,083 --> 00:38:50,375
I don't need it, Amelia.

777
00:38:50,417 --> 00:38:53,583
I'm a grown man
looking for a grown woman.

778
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:57,542
So when you grow up,
come find me.

779
00:38:57,583 --> 00:38:59,291
Because I am as good
as they say.

780
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:10,125
Addisam, huh?

781
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:16,834
Yeah.

782
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:24,959
I will not hurt you.

783
00:39:29,417 --> 00:39:33,000
The reason you're always trying
to see five steps ahead

784
00:39:33,041 --> 00:39:34,792
is because you expect
to get hurt.

785
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:40,583
Those other men,
they hurt you,

786
00:39:40,625 --> 00:39:43,208
so you're always
looking ahead,

787
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:45,792
trying to protect yourself.

788
00:39:48,625 --> 00:39:49,875
There's no protection.

789
00:39:51,291 --> 00:39:53,625
There's no looking ahead.

790
00:39:53,667 --> 00:39:56,041
You're gonna
have to trust me.

791
00:39:59,208 --> 00:40:01,542
I will not hurt you. Okay?

792
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:06,750
I will not hurt you.

793
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,041
Say it.

794
00:40:15,959 --> 00:40:19,000
You will not hurt me.

795
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,333
I will not hurt you.

796
00:40:48,083 --> 00:40:49,041
Hey.

797
00:40:49,083 --> 00:40:50,250
Hi.

798
00:40:50,291 --> 00:40:53,667
So, Lewis called me.
He got a job.

799
00:40:53,709 --> 00:40:56,709
I mean, I went down there to see
and it's not washing cars.

800
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,250
It's good. It's a good job.

801
00:40:58,291 --> 00:41:01,041
It's at a coffee shop.
He's making coffee.

802
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:05,041
The owner said he trusted
Lewis's smile, which is...

803
00:41:05,083 --> 00:41:07,709
Yeah, he's gonna be
a barista.

804
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:10,667
Last week, he'd never heard of
a latte and now he's a barista.

805
00:41:10,709 --> 00:41:14,125
I mean, isn't that just weird
and great

806
00:41:14,166 --> 00:41:18,083
and somehow hopeful
for the world?

807
00:41:18,125 --> 00:41:20,458
Like no babies in Africa
are gonna starve or--

808
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,083
so instead of being home
with your son,

809
00:41:22,125 --> 00:41:23,583
you're out at 9:00 at night

810
00:41:23,625 --> 00:41:25,166
hanging with your buddy,
the murderer?

811
00:41:25,208 --> 00:41:27,083
No. You did-- did you ju--?

812
00:41:28,375 --> 00:41:29,709
You did not just say that, Pete.

813
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:35,959
Okay. Pete, I'm gonna ask you

814
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,458
what's going on
and you're gonna tell me.

815
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,041
Nothing. There's nothing.

816
00:41:39,083 --> 00:41:42,041
This is not about me
being out late. What's going on?

817
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,291
I don't wanna talk about it.

818
00:41:43,333 --> 00:41:45,917
Well, you're married
to a therapist, Pete.

819
00:41:45,959 --> 00:41:49,792
I can wait here all night.

820
00:41:49,834 --> 00:41:51,000
I've done the prison thing,
okay?

821
00:41:52,667 --> 00:41:53,667
My family...

822
00:41:55,959 --> 00:41:57,000
My mother's in jail.

823
00:41:57,041 --> 00:41:59,041
And my brother's--

824
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:01,041
well, I don't really know
where he is,

825
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:03,041
but he's probably in jail
by now too, so...

826
00:42:03,083 --> 00:42:04,083
Oh, Pete.

827
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:05,542
I don't wanna go there,
Violet.

828
00:42:05,583 --> 00:42:07,500
I'm not sharing.
I don't wanna talk.

829
00:42:07,542 --> 00:42:09,041
They don't matter.
They're your family.

830
00:42:09,083 --> 00:42:10,041
No.

831
00:42:11,625 --> 00:42:14,041
No.

832
00:42:14,083 --> 00:42:16,500
You and Lucas are my family now.
