00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,333
Charlotte?

3
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:39,542
Charlotte.

4
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:41,917
Close the door.

5
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:44,542
I don't want
anyone to see me.

6
00:01:47,917 --> 00:01:50,542
Pete:
Okay. Okay.

7
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:53,709
It's okay.
Shh, shh, shh. I got you.

8
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,583
Pete:
Shh, shh.

9
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:06,041
Is that Dr. King?
Is there anything that we can--?

10
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:08,709
Pete: I got it.
She needs to be admitted--

11
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,375
I've got it.

12
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,542
He took my wallet.
That's what he--

13
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:22,750
he robbed me.

14
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:25,917
Can you lie back for me?

15
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:28,000
I would've just
given it to him, but he--

16
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:30,583
I don't know,
he just kept hitting me.

17
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,750
I need you to lie back
so I can take a look at you.

18
00:02:32,792 --> 00:02:34,166
I'm fine.

19
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:38,041
My hand hurts. I got robbed.
He took my wallet. I just--

20
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:41,083
I need a bandage
and I'll be good as new.

21
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,000
Charlotte, your hand is broken.

22
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:45,000
So's your wrist.

23
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,625
Maybe your nose.

24
00:02:49,792 --> 00:02:52,792
Possibly your eye socket.

25
00:02:54,792 --> 00:02:57,041
Oh.

26
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,000
Let me examine you.

27
00:03:07,917 --> 00:03:11,166
I can't take medication.

28
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:13,041
Pills. You know that.

29
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,333
I know.

30
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:17,041
I need a gown.
Okay.

31
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:19,917
And a nurse to get me into it.
All right.

32
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:24,583
Get Sheila.

33
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:27,041
Not one of those nosy bitches
out there.

34
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,792
Sheila.

35
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,875
She knows how to keep
her mouth shut. She's on four.

36
00:03:30,917 --> 00:03:32,834
Okay. I'll go get Sheila
and I'll be right back.

37
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,625
But, Charlotte, please...

38
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:39,458
Please, lie back.

39
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,917
There's a nurse named Sheila
on four. Go get her.

40
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,709
One of you call the police.

41
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,291
And all of you get back to work.

42
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,959
Sam:
You don't ask your bride-to-be
about strippers.

43
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,959
They don't like it.

44
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,083
Besides, strippers are--
there are germs.

45
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:35,041
I'm not gonna do anything
with the stripper.

46
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:37,834
It's a rite of passage.
Get the stripper.

47
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:40,542
Every man should have a woman
dance on a table for him

48
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:43,542
before he takes the plunge.

49
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,750
Hell, you want me to take
my top off and dance now?

50
00:04:45,792 --> 00:04:46,875
Because I will.

51
00:04:46,917 --> 00:04:48,458
Oh, I'm drunk.

52
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,041
I know I'm drunk because
I just considered

53
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,083
doing very bad things to you.

54
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,166
Things that involve spankings.

55
00:04:56,709 --> 00:04:58,750
I like you.
I like everybody.

56
00:04:58,792 --> 00:04:59,750
Okay, back up.

57
00:04:59,792 --> 00:05:01,000
"Okay, back up."

58
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,709
I hate being
the designated driver.

59
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:06,041
Amelia:
Yeah, well, even with three
drinks in me,

60
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:08,208
I can still
kick your ass at pool.

61
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:11,500
Price:
Two unis found him.

62
00:05:11,542 --> 00:05:13,583
He was wandering the streets,
shouting to himself.

63
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:16,500
In L.A.? Heh. Shocking.
Heh. I know, right?

64
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:19,542
But here's the deal.
He had blood on his clothes.

65
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:22,166
And you didn't take him to the
hospital? You and I both know--

66
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:23,625
not his blood.

67
00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:27,542
He had scratches on him, a
pretty good bruise on his face,

68
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:28,750
but it wasn't his blood.

69
00:05:28,792 --> 00:05:31,333
We tried to talk to him,
we tried to help him.

70
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,583
He kicked one of the unis.
They had to arrest him.

71
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,500
Because there aren't any actual
criminals in L.A.

72
00:05:35,542 --> 00:05:37,375
I was sleeping, you know.

73
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:40,542
Shelly, I'm trying to do
a good thing here.

74
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,583
He's a messed up guy.

75
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,041
Now, maybe he witnessed
something,

76
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,375
maybe he did something bad.

77
00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:47,041
But you're on the 5150 team,

78
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,166
so do your job.
Evaluate the guy.

79
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:55,458
Price:
His name's Lee.
That's all we could get.

80
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:00,291
Do me a favor.

81
00:06:01,417 --> 00:06:03,583
Turn off the cameras, huh?

82
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:13,959
He was about 5'8" or bigger.

83
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,667
Blond, maybe. Maybe brown hair.
I don't know.

84
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:21,041
He had on jeans or khakis.

85
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,041
I don't know for sure
what he was wearing. Ow.

86
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,583
Sorry. Are you positive this
guy's not still in the building?

87
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,458
Security did a sweep
floor to floor.

88
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,208
Does that mean you're sure or
are you just saying you're sure?

89
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:35,542
Addison, what are you doing
here? You're not on call.

90
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,500
I had a mom who thought
that she was in labor.

91
00:06:40,542 --> 00:06:43,041
It was a false alarm.
And then I heard.

92
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:45,709
Is there anything else you can
tell us? Did he say anything?

93
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,917
Pete:
She's told you everything.

94
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:49,041
He didn't say anything.
See? Now find the guy.

95
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,792
Policeman 1:
We have to complete the report.

96
00:06:50,834 --> 00:06:52,041
Pete:
Report.

97
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,375
Policeman 1:
And the forensic nurse
needs samples.

98
00:06:54,417 --> 00:06:56,917
Pete:
Screw that. She's injured.
She needs medical attention.

99
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,417
Policeman 1:
There's a process here.

100
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,041
Pete:
She's been through enough.

101
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:02,667
Policeman 2:
Now you're getting
in the way of us doing our job.

102
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:04,041
Pete:
Your job is to find the guy.

103
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,667
There's a violent criminal
out there.

104
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:09,458
I'm sorry.
Okay, everybody out. Move.

105
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,959
Ma'am--
Addison: I said, out.

106
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,125
Pete:
Come on. Let's go. Out.

107
00:07:16,792 --> 00:07:18,875
You too.
I haven't finished. She needs--

108
00:07:18,917 --> 00:07:20,083
Pete.

109
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,083
Life's a bitch, ain't it?

110
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:44,917
Let's get you cleaned up.

111
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,083
Hey. What are you--?

112
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,750
Cooper:
Violet!
You're in a bar with a baby!

113
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:06,458
Are you loco?
Have you gone la cuckoo?

114
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,000
Why don't you people
answer your phone?

115
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,500
What's wrong?

116
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,583
Coop, wait.

117
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,041
Okay, thank you.
I have everything.

118
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:40,542
I just need
to bag your clothes, okay?

119
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,041
That's the worst of it.

120
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:51,667
Charlotte, it means a lot
that you called me.

121
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:53,792
I know that
we haven't always...

122
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:59,834
I'm here for you,
whatever you need, okay?

123
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,458
Nurse:
Underwear?

124
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,625
What?

125
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,625
I have a dress,
a bra, two shoes,

126
00:09:05,667 --> 00:09:07,625
but there's no underwear.

127
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:09,625
Oh.

128
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:11,375
I don't wear underwear.

129
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:15,000
They just get in the way.

130
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,208
She doesn't. I think it's gross,

131
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,500
but to each his own, right?

132
00:09:21,542 --> 00:09:23,000
I guess.

133
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:48,709
You'll need the HIV cocktail,
the morning-after pill,

134
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,458
std prophylaxis and a pelvic.

135
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,542
Right?

136
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,000
Right.

137
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,208
I don't think I want you
down there one-handed.

138
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:49,041
I just need to examine you for
any internal tears or injuries,

139
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,750
then I'll do a rape kit.

140
00:10:50,792 --> 00:10:53,041
I'll collect pubic hairs,
pelvic washings, blood samples--

141
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,041
no rape kit.

142
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:58,500
I wasn't raped, I was robbed.

143
00:10:58,542 --> 00:11:00,834
Charlotte--
no rape kit.

144
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,041
Charlotte--
what you and I know,

145
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:06,500
those cops out there,
they don't know.

146
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:09,792
They know I was robbed.
Now, you can't tell anyone.

147
00:11:09,834 --> 00:11:11,917
No rape kit.

148
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:16,166
I'm so sorry, Charlotte,
but I have a legal obligation--

149
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,250
I called you.

150
00:11:20,792 --> 00:11:21,917
I called you.

151
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:24,542
Okay. It's okay.

152
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,542
No rape kit.

153
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:30,667
He took my wallet.

154
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:33,000
He didn't take anything else.

155
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,625
No rape kit.

156
00:11:38,917 --> 00:11:40,709
No rape.

157
00:12:00,917 --> 00:12:02,667
Hey. How is she?

158
00:12:02,709 --> 00:12:04,500
Pete:
She's with Addison.
She's okay considering--

159
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:05,667
what the hell happened?

160
00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:07,500
A guy beat her up,
stole her wallet.

161
00:12:07,542 --> 00:12:09,291
Where are the cops?
Cops are on it.

162
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,583
Okay. What the hell happened,
Pete?

163
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:14,041
I mean-- I mean, where is she?
I mean, where is she?

164
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,291
I need to know.

165
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:19,041
Whoa, hold on. Hold on.
Easy. Easy. Come over here.

166
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,583
Come over here.
They were in a bar.

167
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,583
The nanny's coming to pick up
Lucas. Can you--?

168
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:26,000
Oh, yeah, yeah. Go.
All right.

169
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:27,875
Are you sober?
Below the legal limit.

170
00:12:27,917 --> 00:12:30,083
Charlotte took a blow to her
eye socket and vomited.

171
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,625
Could be a concussion--

172
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,834
I'll get a ct of her head and
facial bones, do a neuro exam.

173
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,500
Sam: It's okay.
Cooper: It's not okay.

174
00:12:35,542 --> 00:12:37,500
Charlotte is hurt and I'm not--
Sam: You're drunk.

175
00:12:37,542 --> 00:12:39,250
Okay, Charlotte's hurt
and I'm drunken.

176
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,542
Sam:
Calm down. Calm down.

177
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,208
Charlotte's hurt.
Yes.

178
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,750
Okay, I'm gonna kill somebody.
I'm gonna kill somebody.

179
00:12:44,792 --> 00:12:46,625
Pete: Come on, Coop. Calm down.
Cooper: Let me go!

180
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,500
Guys, come on! I'm calm.

181
00:12:49,542 --> 00:12:51,625
Calm down.
I'm calm. I'm calm. I'm calm.

182
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:54,041
Sorry.

183
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,834
Ow!

184
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:03,458
Sam:
Coop.

185
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,667
What the hell happened?

186
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:08,500
Can you tell me
what you were doing?

187
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:14,125
You were on the streets.
You seemed confused, they said.

188
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,625
Were you nervous?
Is that why you kicked the cop?

189
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:21,542
You're clean, you're well-fed.
You're not homeless.

190
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:23,709
Is someone missing you?

191
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:27,375
Do you need me
to help get you home?

192
00:13:27,417 --> 00:13:30,083
Or away from home,
or, uh...?

193
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,709
I'm not a cop.

194
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,333
I hate cops.

195
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:47,834
They call me Shelly, and I hate
guys that call me Shelly.

196
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:51,959
I just wanna make sure
you're okay.

197
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm on your side.

198
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:04,750
I had a bad night.

199
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,792
That happens.

200
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,208
Cooper:
Ouch.

201
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,834
Sobering up?
I can hang another bag.

202
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,250
No, I'm sober.

203
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:31,625
I need to get to Charlotte.
You need to let the bag finish.

204
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:34,041
I need to get to Charlotte--
Addison: Hey.

205
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,834
Pete: How's she doing?
What room is she in?

206
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,625
You need to prepare yourself.
She doesn't look great.

207
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:41,000
I can handle it.
What room is she in?

208
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:42,208
524e.

209
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,000
Uh--
okay.

210
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,667
Hell of a night.

211
00:14:50,709 --> 00:14:52,667
Hoo. Yeah.

212
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:54,250
It's good you were here.

213
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:56,667
A woman who's been attacked

214
00:14:56,709 --> 00:14:59,000
is usually more comfortable
with another woman.

215
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:03,291
Yeah.
Addison?

216
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:33,166
Coop.

217
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:37,041
Coop, come here.

218
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,375
Come here.

219
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:09,750
I'm okay, Coop.
Okay.

220
00:16:11,917 --> 00:16:13,792
I'm okay.

221
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,583
It's gonna be okay.

222
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,375
It's important you don't move
while the ct--

223
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:25,041
I know how a ct works.

224
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:28,291
Sorry. Of course you do.

225
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:33,583
You know you're gonna need
stitches.

226
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,750
Yay for me.

227
00:16:35,792 --> 00:16:38,041
I could page somebody
in plastics.

228
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:40,792
I don't wanna involve plastics.

229
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:46,166
Less people that know your
business, the better. I get it.

230
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:53,709
I could do them.

231
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,125
I got a gift with sutures.

232
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:59,333
Never leave a scar.
It's freakish how good I am.

233
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:02,208
Thank you.

234
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:06,041
Plus, you get the good drugs
that go along with stitches.

235
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,375
No drugs for me.

236
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,250
God Grant me the Serenity

237
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:21,583
to accept the things
I cannot change.

238
00:17:24,917 --> 00:17:28,041
The courage
to change the things I can.

239
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:31,667
And the wisdom to know
the difference.

240
00:17:31,709 --> 00:17:33,834
I thought you seemed
like one of my people.

241
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,333
Well,
it takes one to know one.

242
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,542
I've been
drinking a lot lately.

243
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,375
No pills, but, um...

244
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:52,417
Drinking.
Which is a gateway.

245
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:55,709
You been going to meetings?

246
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:58,625
No.

247
00:17:58,667 --> 00:18:00,000
You need to take your butt
to meetings.

248
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:05,291
I'll go with you.
I know the best ones.

249
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,625
Thanks.

250
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:11,333
No problem.

251
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,792
Now remember, don't move.

252
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,417
The nanny said she'll watch
Lucas as long as we need.

253
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:26,625
We should pay her more.

254
00:18:26,667 --> 00:18:28,917
She's probably a lawyer
in her country or something.

255
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:30,709
Heh. Violet.

256
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,208
No, I'm saying
she takes care of our son.

257
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,792
She keeps him safe. We should
pay her everything we have.

258
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:40,500
The world's a dangerous place.

259
00:18:59,542 --> 00:19:02,166
Hey. I was just texting Naomi.
She's freaking out,

260
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,875
but she told me
to tell you that she knows

261
00:19:03,917 --> 00:19:05,291
you have everything covered.

262
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,583
Yeah. Is she coming home?

263
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,083
She can't.
She's stuck in Zurich

264
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,333
doing some money thing
for William's foundation.

265
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:14,041
Mm. Um,
should we call Sheldon?

266
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,750
I tried.
He's working at the precinct.

267
00:19:15,792 --> 00:19:18,208
Unreachable.
I'll tell him in the morning.

268
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,000
Oh, okay.

269
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,625
What?
Hoo.

270
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:25,250
Nothing. It's just that Nai and
Sheldon always know what to do.

271
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,333
Addison?

272
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:34,959
What?

273
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:40,709
Hey. Addison.

274
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,000
Nothing, it's just, um...

275
00:19:44,542 --> 00:19:46,333
It's just been a hard night.

276
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:47,750
Mm.

277
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,125
Oh, Addison.

278
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,750
I'm so grateful it wasn't you.
Don't say that.

279
00:20:02,792 --> 00:20:05,000
You don't know
what Charlotte's going through.

280
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:08,166
I'm sorry, but i--

281
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,834
with everything-- Maya--

282
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,709
I don't know if I could handle
any more bad news.

283
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,583
Right.

284
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,208
I get that.

285
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,834
I gotta go.
Yeah. Right.

286
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,041
Amelia's doing a ct on Charlotte
and she needs me.

287
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:25,000
Uh, Addison--
right. Okay.

288
00:20:36,542 --> 00:20:38,458
I'd really like it
if you told me

289
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,375
what you meant when
you said you had a bad night.

290
00:20:41,417 --> 00:20:43,792
It was bad.

291
00:20:43,834 --> 00:20:45,917
That's all I wanna say about it
right now, okay?

292
00:20:45,959 --> 00:20:48,041
Okay.

293
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,000
Hey, can I ask you something?

294
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,250
Okay.

295
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,709
What's your last name?

296
00:21:02,709 --> 00:21:05,041
McHenry.

297
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,291
That's a good name.
Hmm.

298
00:21:09,959 --> 00:21:13,250
Have you ever thought of, uh,

299
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:17,000
I don't know, hurting yourself
or hurting someone else?

300
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,041
I just wanna go home.

301
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:23,458
I know you do.
And i-I'm sorry, but you can't.

302
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,125
Not yet. Not until you tell me
what happened tonight.

303
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:30,041
There's no hurry,
I don't want you to feel rushed,

304
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:34,000
but you can't go home until you
tell me. You understand?

305
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,500
This room is gross.

306
00:21:41,542 --> 00:21:43,166
Yeah.

307
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,917
Yeah.
It smells like urine.

308
00:21:44,959 --> 00:21:46,542
Yeah.

309
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:47,542
I don't like it.

310
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:50,542
I don't like it.

311
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,208
Who hurt you, Lee?

312
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,166
Amelia:
You ready?

313
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:12,834
You can't take anything
for this pain?

314
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:16,000
She's allergic to local
anesthetics and she's in n.A.

315
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:18,583
Charlotte:
I'm fine. Just do it.

316
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:37,709
How many more?

317
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,834
You're doing great, Charlotte.

318
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:41,166
How many more?

319
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,166
It's a guess, but maybe 50.

320
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:06,375
So now how many more?
Go get a cup of coffee.

321
00:23:06,417 --> 00:23:08,667
No, I'm not leaving her.
Charlotte: Cooper.

322
00:23:08,709 --> 00:23:10,041
I could use some coffee.

323
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:13,041
Uh-uh.
Charlotte: Really, I could.

324
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:14,792
Look at me, Cooper.

325
00:23:14,834 --> 00:23:18,500
It's okay.
You go, come back with coffee.

326
00:23:18,542 --> 00:23:21,959
A latte. Please.

327
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:32,041
I'm gonna start again.
You ready?

328
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:33,709
Yeah.

329
00:23:47,709 --> 00:23:49,625
Violet:
Pete said
there's no neuro damage.

330
00:23:50,667 --> 00:23:52,417
Good. That's good.

331
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:54,208
I called the cops.
There's no news,

332
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,875
but I'm gonna stay
on top of them.

333
00:23:55,917 --> 00:23:57,041
Call them every day.

334
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:58,750
And I checked
our home security system.

335
00:23:58,792 --> 00:24:00,750
We have a doorman,
but I'm gonna hire somebody

336
00:24:00,792 --> 00:24:01,834
to watch the apartment

337
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:03,542
because maybe that'll
make her feel safer.

338
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:05,083
People never feel safe
after an attack.

339
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:07,542
I mean, you hid in the closet
when the doorbell rang.

340
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:09,709
So I'm thinking an armed man
outside our apartment door

341
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,625
would give her some
peace of mind. Right?

342
00:24:11,667 --> 00:24:14,458
What do you think that costs,
like 50, 60 bucks an hour?

343
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,542
I can cover that.

344
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:17,083
And maybe she'll need
a bodyguard,

345
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:19,000
you know,
like a 24-hour-a-day person

346
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:21,583
to go with her everywhere
for a while.

347
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:23,000
Cooper.

348
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:28,542
I'm supposed to protect her.

349
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:30,542
I know it's the 21st century

350
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:33,291
and you women
have all surpassed us

351
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:34,792
in lifespan,
academic achievement,

352
00:24:34,834 --> 00:24:37,041
intelligence and...

353
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:39,709
You know, well,
everything else, but...

354
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:42,166
When I was a kid,
my dad taught me one thing.

355
00:24:42,208 --> 00:24:43,750
He said, "you find a woman,

356
00:24:43,792 --> 00:24:45,375
"you marry her,
you get her pregnant,

357
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,542
and you spend the rest of your
life taking care of her."

358
00:24:47,583 --> 00:24:50,583
Maybe that's cro-magnon
or something, but...

359
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:56,750
I mean, I'm her man.
I'm supposed to keep her safe.

360
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:04,542
Well, I have been where she is,
and I can tell you

361
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:07,166
that you
don't have to be tough,

362
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:10,125
you just have to be there.

363
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:13,083
Okay?

364
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:15,625
Okay. Now come here.

365
00:25:21,625 --> 00:25:23,542
You know,
and for the record,

366
00:25:23,583 --> 00:25:26,041
cro-magnon is a relief
sometimes.

367
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:28,208
Sometimes cro-magnon
is really hot.

368
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:30,000
Right?

369
00:25:34,291 --> 00:25:37,125
Do you know what this is?

370
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:38,959
It's your file.

371
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,583
It's not thick, it's just
a couple of pages,

372
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:42,834
so that's good, okay?

373
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:45,458
Okay.

374
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:54,458
What's it say?

375
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,625
No criminal record. Dishonorable
discharge from the Navy.

376
00:25:57,667 --> 00:25:59,917
That was a long time ago.
I know.

377
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:04,166
I know. It's just that
it's in your file, so...

378
00:26:04,208 --> 00:26:08,000
I have a job now. I have a
girlfriend. I'm normal now.

379
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,917
Can you tell me about
your girlfriend?

380
00:26:10,959 --> 00:26:12,500
We had a fight.

381
00:26:12,542 --> 00:26:16,500
A fight. When? Tonight?

382
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:20,375
She was screwing this guy
in our bed and I caught her.

383
00:26:20,417 --> 00:26:22,125
Well, that sounds like
quite a fight.

384
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:29,583
She was throwing stuff
and, uh, I was yelling.

385
00:26:29,625 --> 00:26:30,917
And then she hit me.

386
00:26:30,959 --> 00:26:32,250
Hmm. You were angry.

387
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:34,333
No, I wasn't. No.

388
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:38,417
No, she's-- she's my whole life.
My whole life.

389
00:26:38,458 --> 00:26:43,041
She's my everything, you know?
She's real sweet, a good person.

390
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:46,500
I just don't understand
why she would...

391
00:26:46,542 --> 00:26:47,542
You felt betrayed.

392
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:50,500
You know what that
betrayal is called?

393
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:54,041
A stressor. It adds stress
to your life.

394
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:55,458
A lot of stress.

395
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,083
Yeah.

396
00:26:58,125 --> 00:26:59,750
Stress about covers it.

397
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,041
You have a lot of blood
on your clothes, Lee.

398
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,959
Where'd that come from?

399
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:21,125
Hey.

400
00:27:21,166 --> 00:27:23,041
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to wake you.

401
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:26,500
I wasn't really asleep.

402
00:27:26,542 --> 00:27:30,750
I don't think I'm gonna be
sleeping much ever again.

403
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:36,291
Charlotte--
don't.

404
00:27:37,583 --> 00:27:40,709
He could do this
to someone else.

405
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:43,792
Charlotte,
if you don't report this...

406
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:49,041
There are other women
to think about here.

407
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:50,750
I said, don't.

408
00:27:50,792 --> 00:27:52,583
There's no shame.

409
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:57,041
It's not your fault. You need
support, counseling. You need--

410
00:27:57,083 --> 00:27:59,417
if you try
to keep this secret,

411
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:02,875
it is going to eat you alive.
I know it.

412
00:28:05,834 --> 00:28:07,792
You ever been violated?

413
00:28:09,041 --> 00:28:11,750
Anybody rape you lately?

414
00:28:13,709 --> 00:28:14,875
I'm trying to help.

415
00:28:14,917 --> 00:28:18,375
No, hey, let me tell you
what it's like.

416
00:28:18,417 --> 00:28:19,875
You know those
made-for-TV movies

417
00:28:19,917 --> 00:28:22,250
where some woman's always
crouched down naked in a shower

418
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:24,542
holding her knees and sobbing

419
00:28:24,583 --> 00:28:25,792
because when she closes her eyes

420
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:29,041
she can still feel
the guy's hands on her?

421
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:31,041
How, when they show the attack,

422
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:33,875
the woman's eyes
go all blank and still?

423
00:28:33,917 --> 00:28:35,542
She goes to some other place
in her mind

424
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:38,166
just to deal with the horror
of what's happening to her

425
00:28:38,208 --> 00:28:41,417
while some Lilith fair song
plays?

426
00:28:42,792 --> 00:28:44,709
It is nothing like that.

427
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:48,250
It's dirty.

428
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:50,208
And sweaty.

429
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,583
And he licks your face.

430
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:55,458
And he wipes himself off
in your hair.

431
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:00,542
And when you try to scream, he
punches you so hard you see god.

432
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,166
And then he goes at you again.

433
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:08,041
Ripping stuff
you didn't even know you had

434
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:11,000
because he enjoyed it so much
the first time.

435
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,041
I know you're trying to help.

436
00:29:22,083 --> 00:29:25,250
But if helping me means
that everyone,

437
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:27,250
that Cooper,

438
00:29:27,291 --> 00:29:30,041
is gonna be looking at me

439
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:32,000
the way you're
looking at me now,

440
00:29:33,333 --> 00:29:37,458
please, do not help me.

441
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,000
I'm gonna...

442
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:46,000
I'm sorry.

443
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:50,083
I'll go.

444
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:13,250
Let's do something
about your pain.

445
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:17,125
You know how I feel
about hoodoo.

446
00:30:17,166 --> 00:30:19,667
Where does it hurt most?

447
00:30:19,709 --> 00:30:21,500
My soul.

448
00:30:27,667 --> 00:30:31,041
My hand.

449
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:32,250
And my face.

450
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:38,709
Okay.
Then I'll start there. Sheila.

451
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:42,208
Sheldon:
I understand you don't wanna
discuss the blood.

452
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:45,500
I don't. You can't make me.

453
00:30:45,542 --> 00:30:47,125
Would you mind if I talked
to your girlfriend?

454
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:48,750
Maybe called her?
No, you can't do that.

455
00:30:48,792 --> 00:30:50,792
How come?

456
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:56,166
Emasculating bitch.
Always trying to--

457
00:30:56,208 --> 00:30:57,750
emasculating bitch.

458
00:30:59,041 --> 00:31:01,041
How come, Lee?

459
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:02,667
It wasn't just about
the cheating, was it?

460
00:31:02,709 --> 00:31:05,041
She's an emasculating bitch!

461
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:06,875
Lee, what did you do
to your girlfriend?

462
00:31:06,917 --> 00:31:08,417
I didn't do anything.
If she's hurt--

463
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:10,458
I didn't do anything.

464
00:31:11,792 --> 00:31:13,000
Not to her.

465
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,667
Then whose blood is it?

466
00:31:20,083 --> 00:31:23,000
Not hers.

467
00:31:36,667 --> 00:31:39,000
Turn the cameras back on.

468
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:56,000
Pete helped her with her pain.

469
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:58,500
Cooper's in there with her now.

470
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:01,542
You should see if she'll talk
to someone. A psychiatrist.

471
00:32:01,583 --> 00:32:04,667
Mm, I gotta be honest,
I don't wanna go in there.

472
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:09,709
It's kind of like nam for me.

473
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:13,709
Right now, Charlotte
is Vietnam and I'm a vet.

474
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:16,875
The war rages on.

475
00:32:16,917 --> 00:32:20,542
Can you believe this happened
to someone we know?

476
00:32:20,583 --> 00:32:22,583
Again?

477
00:32:23,792 --> 00:32:26,208
I think we're cursed.

478
00:32:28,291 --> 00:32:31,041
When I became a doctor,

479
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:34,208
I thought it would all be
fat babies and happy moms.

480
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:38,041
Thought I was gonna be able
to help people.

481
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:40,709
Not this. Not any of this.
We help people.

482
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:44,208
Yeah, but what's the point when
we can't even help ourselves?

483
00:32:45,583 --> 00:32:48,709
Hey. There you are, Addie.

484
00:32:49,917 --> 00:32:52,458
Do either of you guys want
a bag of over-processed,

485
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,041
partially dehydrogenated crap?
No thanks.

486
00:32:55,083 --> 00:32:56,333
I'm good.
What time is it?

487
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:59,041
Four A.M.
ugh.

488
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:01,834
I've got surgery
tomorrow morning.

489
00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:05,083
Do you think--? Is it rude
if I leave and go home?

490
00:33:05,125 --> 00:33:07,125
What's the etiquette?
What?

491
00:33:07,166 --> 00:33:09,041
I wanna stay, but--

492
00:33:09,083 --> 00:33:11,458
I mean, I don't think anybody
would mind if I went home.

493
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:15,500
Oh, you--? You wanna go home,
Sam? Fine. Go. Go.

494
00:33:15,542 --> 00:33:18,500
Go rest your head on a pillow.
Sleep the sleep of angels.

495
00:33:18,542 --> 00:33:21,041
Amelia: He's saying he's tired.
I know what he's saying.

496
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:23,583
He's saying it doesn't matter
what happened to someone else

497
00:33:23,625 --> 00:33:25,583
because it didn't happen to him,
so he's good, he's out.

498
00:33:25,625 --> 00:33:27,041
What's going on with you?

499
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:29,166
Sit down. You're tired.

500
00:33:33,458 --> 00:33:35,959
Nothing. I...

501
00:33:37,125 --> 00:33:39,041
You're right, I'm tired.

502
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:42,625
We're all tired.

503
00:33:42,667 --> 00:33:44,291
It's nothing.

504
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:46,667
I'll go.
No. I will.

505
00:33:54,709 --> 00:33:55,875
Yuck.

506
00:33:59,792 --> 00:34:02,875
I need to write a memo.

507
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:04,125
What?

508
00:34:04,166 --> 00:34:06,041
A doctor was attacked
on hospital grounds.

509
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:08,417
People are gonna be concerned
for their safety.

510
00:34:08,458 --> 00:34:10,625
Someone else can do that.
I'm chief of staff.

511
00:34:10,667 --> 00:34:12,750
You don't have to worry
about it right now.

512
00:34:12,792 --> 00:34:15,667
I'm chief of staff. Of course
I have to worry about it.

513
00:34:15,709 --> 00:34:16,750
Everyone will understand.

514
00:34:16,792 --> 00:34:18,041
I don't want them to understand.

515
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:20,500
I'm the boss.
You're the victim--

516
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:25,667
you ever call me the victim
again, this marriage is off.

517
00:34:25,709 --> 00:34:27,458
You hear me?
Okay.

518
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,959
Off.
Okay.

519
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,709
I'm sorry.

520
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,542
It's okay.

521
00:34:53,417 --> 00:34:56,041
Where you going, Cooper?

522
00:34:56,083 --> 00:34:57,125
I'm just walking.

523
00:34:57,166 --> 00:34:59,291
Coop, where you going?

524
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:01,041
You shouldn't.
I am.

525
00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:02,208
You don't need to see it.

526
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:05,500
Yeah, I do, actually.

527
00:35:05,542 --> 00:35:06,917
Cooper.
Shut up, Violet.

528
00:35:06,959 --> 00:35:09,250
Cooper--
stop talking.

529
00:35:31,542 --> 00:35:33,875
She fought. She fought him.

530
00:35:33,917 --> 00:35:37,291
She's 90 pounds soaking wet,
but she's a fighter.

531
00:36:02,542 --> 00:36:05,041
Sheldon:
Whose blood is it? Was someone
else an emasculating bitch?

532
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:06,792
Someone that looked like
your girlfriend?

533
00:36:06,834 --> 00:36:08,625
I mean, come on, Lee,

534
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:11,125
in the end,
they're all bitches, right?

535
00:36:12,792 --> 00:36:14,208
She told me to wait my turn.

536
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:16,000
Who?

537
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:19,583
I just wanted some help
and she told me to--

538
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:21,709
she wasn't nice.

539
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:22,917
She had it coming.

540
00:36:22,959 --> 00:36:25,208
Yeah, of course she did.
She had it coming!

541
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,750
What did you do to her?

542
00:36:29,583 --> 00:36:31,542
I hit her.

543
00:36:32,583 --> 00:36:35,166
I hit her hard and she fought.

544
00:36:35,208 --> 00:36:37,458
She was a bitch in heat
and she fought.

545
00:36:39,083 --> 00:36:40,500
But I gave it to her.

546
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:45,583
I gave it to her so good.

547
00:36:48,709 --> 00:36:50,625
Who'd you give it to, Lee?

548
00:36:56,917 --> 00:36:59,166
They're all the same. You hear
me? They're all the same.

549
00:36:59,208 --> 00:37:01,542
Guard!
They're all the same.

550
00:37:01,583 --> 00:37:03,667
Get him off of him. Get him off.

551
00:37:03,709 --> 00:37:05,875
Lee: They're all the same.
Price: Get him off of him.

552
00:37:29,834 --> 00:37:31,875
I can wait.

553
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,542
I'll wait it out.

554
00:37:36,917 --> 00:37:38,041
I love you.

555
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:39,750
I can't tell you.

556
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:44,792
Are you breaking up with me?

557
00:37:53,375 --> 00:37:55,041
That's funny?

558
00:37:55,083 --> 00:37:56,709
No.

559
00:38:00,208 --> 00:38:02,917
Oh, my god.
I needed that.

560
00:38:02,959 --> 00:38:05,291
Sam, I love you.
You know that, right?

561
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:06,709
Well, I do now.

562
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:09,709
What is it
you're not telling me?

563
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,041
I can't.
Talk to me.

564
00:38:11,083 --> 00:38:12,500
If I start talking,

565
00:38:12,542 --> 00:38:14,417
then I'm not gonna be able
to stop, and this--

566
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,375
this is not something
I can talk to you about.

567
00:38:16,417 --> 00:38:18,041
I need you to trust me.
Do you trust me?

568
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:21,750
Yes, I trust you.
Then, please, don't ask. Just...

569
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:25,542
Tell me everything
is gonna be okay.

570
00:38:25,583 --> 00:38:28,875
Everything is gonna be okay.

571
00:38:28,917 --> 00:38:30,375
Just be here.

572
00:38:30,417 --> 00:38:33,000
Don't leave me alone.
Okay.

573
00:38:51,542 --> 00:38:54,041
You should be in bed.
Help me get these on.

574
00:38:54,083 --> 00:38:55,375
You don't need
to put them on--

575
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:57,709
my ass is swinging in the wind.
Help me.

576
00:38:59,583 --> 00:39:02,375
Fine.

577
00:39:03,834 --> 00:39:05,458
I'll do it,
I'll do it, I'll do it.

578
00:39:12,834 --> 00:39:15,000
Untie this gown.

579
00:39:16,959 --> 00:39:18,208
Get me in that shirt.

580
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:23,041
Charlotte--
I wanna go home.

581
00:39:23,083 --> 00:39:26,041
Please.

582
00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:29,000
I don't wanna
be in this hospital.

583
00:39:44,083 --> 00:39:45,792
Cooper:
Okay, okay.

584
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:53,000
Charlotte:
Thank you.

585
00:39:57,667 --> 00:39:59,750
Look at me.

586
00:40:04,625 --> 00:40:06,250
Thank you.

587
00:40:08,333 --> 00:40:09,875
For loving me.

588
00:40:13,125 --> 00:40:15,250
Take me home.

589
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:21,333
Thanks.

590
00:40:25,083 --> 00:40:31,417
So was he telling the truth,
or was he, you know, crazy?

591
00:40:31,458 --> 00:40:33,041
Both.
Oh.

592
00:40:33,083 --> 00:40:34,208
Are you gonna hold him?

593
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:37,625
Well, we could arraign him
on assault.

594
00:40:37,667 --> 00:40:40,333
I mean, he kicked a cop,
he attacked you.

595
00:40:40,375 --> 00:40:43,041
If he makes bail, even if you
say to hold him on a psych eval,

596
00:40:43,083 --> 00:40:44,458
he'll be out on the street
in 72 hours.

597
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,917
He raped someone.
Yeah.

598
00:40:46,959 --> 00:40:48,458
There's a woman out there
that he raped.

599
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:52,041
We can put his DNA in the
system, but there's no victim.

600
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:54,125
I mean, to hold him,
to charge him,

601
00:40:54,166 --> 00:40:56,041
someone's gotta
file charges.

602
00:40:56,083 --> 00:40:57,333
We gotta get a case.

603
00:40:57,375 --> 00:41:00,875
Joe, the man's a rapist.

604
00:41:02,375 --> 00:41:04,125
Ain't life a bitch, Shelly?

605
00:41:15,208 --> 00:41:16,583
Pete:
We should get you a wheelchair.

606
00:41:16,625 --> 00:41:18,125
I'll walk out of here
on my own steam

607
00:41:18,166 --> 00:41:20,000
unless I'm in a body bag
or a coma.

608
00:41:32,083 --> 00:41:34,333
Charlotte:
No!

609
00:41:47,375 --> 00:41:49,166
Don't you people have
somewhere to be?

610
00:42:00,083 --> 00:42:02,041
Don't let me fall.
I won't.

611
00:42:04,625 --> 00:42:07,041
No.

612
00:42:10,625 --> 00:42:11,750
No!
