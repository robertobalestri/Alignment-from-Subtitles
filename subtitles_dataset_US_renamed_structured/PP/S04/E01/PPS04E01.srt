that if he keeps annoying me
about this,

123
00:06:02,792 --> 00:06:06,375

waiting list.

133
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,417

135

being more positive?
Screw positive.

136
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,041

with the antibodies from

137

and you know it.

A kidney from your brother

141
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:47,000
would decrease the chance
of rejection by 90%.

142
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,375
I got a better idea.

143
00:06:51,417 --> 00:06:54,166

already told me you tried

144
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:57,000
to buy your way to the top of
the transplant list last week.

145
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,375
Well, I offered him a new
m.R.I. For the hospital.

146
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:01,417
And for you?

147
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:05,417
How about a new sports car?

148
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,834
Where's your sense of humor,
Dr. King?

149
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,625

in you dying.

150
00:07:10,667 --> 00:07:12,208

151
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,041

153
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,542

our embryo

155
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:24,041
- carried by a surrogate.
- Yeah.

156
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:27,917
Given Kendra's history with
lupus, that's a good option.

157
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:30,333
There are
a few potential issues.
We've used a surrogate before.

158
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:35,917
Oh. Uh, it--it says here
that you have no children.

159
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:38,125
We lost our son.

160
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,041
Oh, I'm sorry.

161
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,875
His name was Max,
and he was 5 months old.

162
00:07:42,917 --> 00:07:45,500
He had just started
to sit up.

163
00:07:45,542 --> 00:07:47,041
He would smile

164
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,542
when either one of us
would come into the room.

165
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:52,083
But just us,
which made us feel like...

166
00:07:53,917 --> 00:07:57,041
And then he was gone.

167
00:07:57,083 --> 00:08:00,417
Please, Dr. Bennett...

168
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,000

You want to hear something
incredibly sad?
Who says yes to that?

170
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:09,959
I'm gonna tell you anyway.
This couple I just saw

171
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,041
lost their baby
at 5 months old.

172
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,125
Oh.
And they're desperate
to have another one,

173
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:18,333
and his sperm count is fine,
and given her age

174
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,333
and her ovarian reserve,
I mean...

175
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,959
"Kendra Walker"?

176
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,500
Is her husband named Dave?

177
00:08:25,542 --> 00:08:27,834
Yeah. You know them?

178
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,208
Yeah. I was in the E.R.
when their baby came in.

179
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,709
The father
left him in the car,

180
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,542
and he suffocated to death.

181
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:38,709
Good. Mr. Mason, you're here.

182
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,291
Given the severity
of your brother's condition,

183
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:44,792
we'd need to do the transplant
as quickly as possible.
Dr. King--

184
00:08:44,834 --> 00:08:46,458
we just need a basic workup,

185
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,458
and we could have you under
the knife in the next 24 hours.
Dr. King.

186
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,041
I understand this must be
a lot to take in,

187
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,041
but if you have any questions,

188
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,792
we'd be happy
to talk about them.

189
00:08:56,834 --> 00:08:58,625
What do these tubes do?

190
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,333
The big ones carry the blood
to be filtered,

191
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:06,250
and the small ones
carry the cardiac meds.

192
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:11,458
Kevin, do you know
why you're here today?

193
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,000
Yeah, my big brother
needs my help.

194
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,583
Right, Ryan?

195
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,500
That's right, buddy.

196
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:21,917
Yay. I get to help.

197
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:32,041
Hey, he's a little slow,
but he's all right.

198
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,709
He can dress himself.
He goes to the store.

199
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,792
He has friends.
Where does he live?

200
00:09:36,834 --> 00:09:39,000
In a kind of, uh,
group home or something.

201
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:41,375
But you're not sure.
Look, I pay for it.

202
00:09:41,417 --> 00:09:43,041
You know, he's happy

203
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,041
living with other people
just like him, okay?

204
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,083
I don't see him that often.
Well, given his mental state,

205
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,041
I can understand
why you had qualms

206
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:52,500
asking him
to donate a kidney.

207
00:09:52,542 --> 00:09:55,458
I had qualms calling him
because Kevin is needy.

208
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,750
You have to explain everything
a thousand times.

209
00:09:58,792 --> 00:10:00,750
He gets so emotional.
It's just...

210
00:10:00,792 --> 00:10:02,250
It's exhausting.

211
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:04,417
Now you'll be
just sweet enough

212
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:07,041
that he'll agree
to give you a kidney.
Well, that's what you
told me to do, Dr. King.

213
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:10,041
And the truth is,
I won't have to be that sweet.

214
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,959
Kevin idolizes me.

215
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,041
He'll do anything for me.

216
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,041
Dr. Bennett wanted us to talk.

217
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,458
To make sure we're ready
to have another baby.

218
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,041
We get it.

219
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,041
Well, we'd also
like to understand

220
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,041
why you didn't say anything
about how your son died

221
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,166
when you first came in.

222
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,750
People look at you different

223
00:10:32,792 --> 00:10:34,792
when they know.

224
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,709
They judge.

225
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,709
But we're good parents,
and we'd like to be again.

226
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,709
I have no doubt
you could be good parents.

227
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,750
What I'd like to understand
is how you grieved his death.

228
00:10:44,792 --> 00:10:47,333
How we...

229
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,625
How? Uh...

230
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:54,041
I don't know how.

231
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,542
There is no how.

232
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,834
Like there's a way to grieve.

233
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,208
There's no way. You just...

234
00:11:03,417 --> 00:11:06,041
Kendra took Max to daycare...

235
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,583
Every day.

236
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:11,041
That morning, she wasn't
feeling well. She had the flu.

237
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:14,959
So she asked... me
to take Max.

238
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:19,709
When I get behind the wheel
in the morning,

239
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,500
I always do the same thing--

240
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:23,500
briefcase on the seat,
coffee in the cup holder,

241
00:11:23,542 --> 00:11:25,041
turn on public radio.

242
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:28,083
Later, I learned there's
a thing called autopilot.

243
00:11:29,792 --> 00:11:31,125
You do something enough,

244
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,125
you don't even
think about it anymore.

245
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:35,166
You don't even
notice it anymore.

246
00:11:36,917 --> 00:11:39,750
And that's what I did.

247
00:11:39,792 --> 00:11:42,333
I went into autopilot.

248
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:46,959
One minute I was
turning on public radio...

249
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And the next,
I was in my office.

250
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:57,333
The car seat...

251
00:11:57,375 --> 00:12:01,625
They make 'em
so they face backward...

252
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:04,792
And he was sleeping.

253
00:12:04,834 --> 00:12:08,750
I didn't hear him,
couldn't see him.

254
00:12:11,917 --> 00:12:17,000
I was sitting at my computer,
late for a staff meeting.

255
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:19,500
It was lunchtime.

256
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,583
And then my...

257
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:26,792
Screensaver popped up.

258
00:12:26,834 --> 00:12:31,208
Max's face is my screensaver.

259
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,041
And I just... ran.

260
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:37,291
I ran to the car.

261
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:40,417
But... it was summer.

262
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:43,458
It was hot, and...

263
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:52,625
Kendra, can you tell me
what this has been like for you?

264
00:12:52,667 --> 00:12:55,208
You're asking me
if I hate my husband?

265
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,625
No--

266
00:12:57,667 --> 00:12:59,709
I don't.

267
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,083
I'm...

268
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,041
Numb or something.

269
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,041
But you've stayed
with your husband,

270
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,041
and you want to have
another child.

271
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,917
Either I try
to start over or...

272
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:11,917
Or what?

273
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:16,750
I... don't know.

274
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:24,875
He has no idea what
his brother's asking him to do,

275
00:13:24,917 --> 00:13:26,959
what it means
to undergo a surgery,

276
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,041
and then the risk
of having only one kidney

277
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:32,041
with a family history
of nephrotic disease.
If Kevin's I.Q.
Were 20 points higher,

278
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,291
we wouldn't even
be having this conversation.

279
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,917
We'd be praising him

280
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:38,917
for putting his family first
and doing the right thing.

281
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,542
Look...

282
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,583
I'm not in love
with this idea,

283
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:45,542
but intelligence
has nothing to do with love.

284
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,000
And I think
Kevin understands that.

285
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,041
I think Kevin loves his brother
and feels a responsibility

286
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,834
to help him.
Is it love?

287
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:54,291
Or is Kevin just so starved
for his brother's attention

288
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,291
after being dumped
into some group home

289
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:59,417
the minute their parents died
that he'd do anything for him?

290
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,041
Ryan's an ass, Sam.

291
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:05,625
Maybe, but does that mean he
doesn't have the right to live?

292
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,417
Addison?

293
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,125
Are you all right?

294
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,709
Hey. Yeah, i'm... fine.

295
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,542
I didn't know how you felt
about Violet and me.

296
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,959
You looked upset,
so I th--i thought--

297
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,041
dead babies.
That's why I look...

298
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,542
Uh, congratulations.

299
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:27,375
Look, I know how much you wanted
things to work out with Sam.

300
00:14:27,417 --> 00:14:29,333
And I was hoping
they would, too,

301
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,959
especially
given me and Violet.

302
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,959
It would've been... nice.
Yeah.

303
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,458
Would've been nice.

304
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,333
If you ever want to talk--

305
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,959
talking to you

306
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,959
about what happened
between me and Sam?

307
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,959
I'd rather
think about dead babies.

308
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,667
But... thank you.

309
00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:45,667
Okay. I don't want this
to sound patronizing,

310
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:49,041
but you are gonna find
someone great.

311
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:51,083
You will.

312
00:15:03,709 --> 00:15:06,291
I got your message,
Dr. Bennett.

313
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,291
You said
you wanted to see me.

314
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,500
Have a seat, dink.

315
00:15:14,917 --> 00:15:17,458
Okay.

316
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,792
What the hell you doing?

317
00:15:19,834 --> 00:15:23,125
Uh, I'm not sure
I understand--

318
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,750
you have a wife and a child,
and you're never around.

319
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:28,291
Now I understand
it can be difficult

320
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,291
once the excitement
of the birth wears off,

321
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:33,208
but hey, man, this is--this is
when the real work starts.

322
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,542
I'm not afraid
of hard work.
Well, then
why aren't you there?

323
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:39,208
Whenever you're a no-show
for your new family,

324
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,208
Naomi ends up
calling me for help,

325
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,041
and I'm happy to do it,

326
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:46,417
but quite frankly, I'm getting
tired of covering for you.

327
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,834
Yeah, it's just...

328
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:52,291
It's just what?

329
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,083
I gotta go.

330
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:59,041
Yes, the father carries around
almost unbearable guilt,

331
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,250
and, yes, the mother
has compensated

332
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:04,333
by essentially
shutting down emotionally.
But you still think that
they should be parents again?

333
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,333
Well, they're struggling to
accept a major tragedy,

334
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:09,333
but I-I don't think they're
unrealistic about what happened.

335
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:12,041
They've grieved.
It's been two years, okay?

336
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,667
I'm just not sure what
the marginal benefit would be

337
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:17,041
to making them wait
to start their lives again.

338
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,041
Stop trying to justify this
to me, okay?

339
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:22,041
It's your practice,
your patients.
They need your help, Addison.

340
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:24,583
The surrogate has significant
scarring of her uterus

341
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,750
secondary to instrumentation
after a postpartum hemorrhage.

342
00:16:26,792 --> 00:16:29,583
No. I'm not getting involved.
You're the only doctor

343
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:31,500
in this half of the country
who can help them.

344
00:16:31,542 --> 00:16:33,500
They'll never find
another surrogate.

345
00:16:33,542 --> 00:16:36,291
They'll never be allowed
to adopt.
How much do they need
to suffer, Addison?

346
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,583
And I'm not baiting you.
I'm really asking.

347
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:41,041
I'm not sure if that husband
or that wife are ever

348
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:44,041
gonna be able to heal completely
until they get another chance,

349
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,041
and even then,
there are no guarantees.

350
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:48,583
But I think they deserve
a shot.

351
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:52,041
Dr. Bennett said that my kidney
is the right one for Ryan.

352
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:54,792
How good's the match?
6 out of 6 alleles.

353
00:16:54,834 --> 00:16:56,500
Have a seat, Kevin.

354
00:16:56,542 --> 00:16:58,500
I want to help Ryan.

355
00:16:58,542 --> 00:17:00,041
It's not that simple.

356
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:03,041
If you get sick the same way
Ryan is, it'll be a problem.

357
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,041
Then Ryan will help me.

358
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,041
I mean, he'll give me
his kidney.

359
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,041
It doesn't work like that.

360
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,583
Ryan can't give you
his kidney.
But he would.

361
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:15,542
I mean, he would do it for me
like I would do it for him.

362
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,417
Brothers help each other.

363
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:19,125
Right, Dr. Bennett?

364
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:21,041
Yeah.

365
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,041
They do.

366
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:26,041
I understand how much
you want to help your brother.

367
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:29,625
But when was the last time
he did anything for you?

368
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:31,041
Well, he's really busy.

369
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,208
He's got a job,
and I don't.

370
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,375
It's okay
that you don't have a job.

371
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:42,041
Maybe my job
is to help Ryan?

372
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,625
Does the maid of honor
usually make a toast?

373
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:53,041
Usually right after he helps
bustle the bride's dress.

374
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,041
Hey, you know what?
You can think it's lame,

375
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:58,834
but it's a big deal.
It's--it's a weird big deal.

376
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,667
She's taking advantage
of you.

377
00:18:00,709 --> 00:18:03,583
She's not taking--we have
that kind of relationship.

378
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:06,000
It's... special.

379
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:09,041
What's Violet do for you?

380
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:13,458
She knows me
and why I do what I do.

381
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,500
I can talk to Violet
about anything,

382
00:18:15,542 --> 00:18:18,417
and after I do,
I know we're gonna be okay.
Well, I'm glad to hear
you and Violet

383
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:21,041
have this thing together
that makes you so damn happy.

384
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,208
Call me crazy, but I figured
you just decided

385
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,291
you wanted to marry me
because I was that person.
We're--we're in the middle
of an argument.

386
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:29,291
Where are you going?
I'm getting ready
to help yank the kidney

387
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:32,333
out of a mentally retarded guy
who doesn't know any better.

388
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:35,000
I'm a humanitarian.
Didn't you know that?

389
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,041
What are you doing?

390
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,959
I... came up for breakfast.

391
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,959
Did it belong
to someone else?

392
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,041
Because you look guilty.

393
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:50,750
I'm avoiding someone.
Uh, what are you doing here?

394
00:18:50,792 --> 00:18:52,750
I got bored
hanging around Addison's.

395
00:18:52,792 --> 00:18:55,125
I was kind of hoping a patient
would stroke out

396
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:57,458
or bang their skull
against something

397
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,375
so I'd have a chance
to cut open their head.
If it were anyone
but you saying that,

398
00:19:00,417 --> 00:19:03,083
I'd be recommending therapy.
So who you hiding from?

399
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,959
Charlotte.
Oh, because she picked Cooper?

400
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,125
I'm mad, which is...
Completely reasonable.

401
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:09,750
Don't you think?

402
00:19:09,792 --> 00:19:11,125
You're the shrink.

403
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,125
We're notoriously bad
at self-analysis,

404
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:16,959
but every time I see Charlotte,
I wanna... punch a puppy.

405
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,333
She screwed you, Sheldon.

406
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:24,542
She ditched you for another man.
You don't have to let it go.
Well, I-I just--

407
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,333
why hide your feelings?
You work here.

408
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,166
Walk around
with your head held high

409
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:31,875
and say
to hell with Charlotte king.

410
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:37,000
I'm not a bad guy, Dr. King.

411
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,542
I just...

412
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,542
You know,
I spent my whole life

413
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:44,125
watching my parents
so focused on Kevin.

414
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:47,041
It was always about him.

415
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,917
I just had... me.

416
00:19:49,959 --> 00:19:51,583
I'm sure
it must have been difficult.

417
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,041
When they died,

418
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,166
I was in the middle
of building a business,

419
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:57,792
of building a life
for myself.

420
00:19:57,834 --> 00:20:00,792
I couldn't take care of him
the way he needs.

421
00:20:00,834 --> 00:20:03,000
We both would've been
worse off.

422
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:07,375
After a while,
I had my life,

423
00:20:07,417 --> 00:20:10,208
he had his.

424
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:14,000
Think about what he's doing
for you now.

425
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:17,000
Let's get him prepped.

426
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,041
Is this low back sexy

427
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:26,041
or a little hoochie?

428
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,792
Right.
It's a little hoochie.

429
00:20:27,834 --> 00:20:30,041
Then there's this one,
which is, um...

430
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,041
Very, very beautiful,

431
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:35,250
but do you think
I can carry off

432
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,000
a bow at the bust?

433
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,417
Cooper?
I can't do wedding stuff
right now.

434
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,417
Okay. Well, I have to put on

435
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:46,041
one of these dresses
in the next 24 hours,

436
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:49,041
so when exactly
do you want to do it?
Why do I have to do it at all?

437
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,041
Wait.
Am i--am I talking to,

438
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,208
uh, objective Cooper
or friend Cooper right now?

439
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,208
Friend Cooper would say,
skip the bow.

440
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,125
Objective Cooper would say,

441
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,834
skip the wedding.
Still?

442
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,834
Wow. You can't get these guys
on the same page, huh?

443
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:07,041
I'm working on it.

444
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:10,417
H-How well do you think
you know Pete?

445
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,417
Um... well, let's see.

446
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:14,041
We, uh...

447
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,041
We conceived
a child together,

448
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:19,125
and then went through a--
okay. Were you surprised
when he proposed?

449
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,041
Yes.

450
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:23,250
But it was
a good surprise.

451
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:26,750
This time.

452
00:21:26,792 --> 00:21:30,125
Are you really
that worried about me?

453
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:33,041
And us.

454
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,041
Even after you and Pete
get married,

455
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:38,041
I still want us to be us.

456
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:39,750
Well, that will never change,

457
00:21:39,792 --> 00:21:42,792
ever.

458
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:47,000
Hey, Addie.
Have you got a second?

459
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:49,709
Yeah. Walk with me.
Hi, Sam.

460
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,750
Hey, Amelia.

461
00:21:51,792 --> 00:21:54,083
Hello, Addison.

462
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:56,500
Hello.

463
00:21:56,542 --> 00:22:00,375
Okay, well, I gotta get back
to the hospital, so...

464
00:22:00,417 --> 00:22:03,000
What exactly went on
between the two of you?

465
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,041
Because that mojo is bad.

466
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,959
You wanted something,
Amelia?

467
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,417
Yes. I tried calling Derek.

468
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:10,417
Actually,
I called and e-mailed.

469
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:12,500
He's ignoring me,
so the only way

470
00:22:12,542 --> 00:22:14,542
I can find out how he's doing
is to call my mother,

471
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,125
who lectures me on how
I should call my brother,

472
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:19,125
which means
I have to get off the phone

473
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:21,542
before I find out
how he's doing.
He's doing fine.

474
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:24,041
Wait, you've heard
from him?

475
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:26,125
Yes, Amelia. I--

476
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:28,792
well, that kinda says it all,
doesn't it?

477
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:37,041
How did it go?

478
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:38,458
Smoothly.

479
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,458
Your new kidney
started working right away.

480
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,458
You're gonna be a bit sore,

481
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,041
but we'll have you
on your feet in no time.

482
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:48,041
Wh--oh.
What about Kevin? Is he okay?

483
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:50,667
Well, why don't you
ask him yourself?

484
00:22:54,834 --> 00:22:58,458
Hey. Did it work?
Did I help?

485
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,041
Yeah. It worked.

486
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:02,792
You saved me, buddy.

487
00:23:02,834 --> 00:23:04,166
I'm never gonna forget it.

488
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:06,917
I knew I could, Ryan.

489
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:08,792
I knew it.

490
00:23:11,667 --> 00:23:15,041
It's gonna be different now.
I'm gonna be different.

491
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:17,041
I'm happy to hear it.

492
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:19,417
How bad is the scarring?

493
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:22,041
There's something
you can do, right?

494
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:24,834
Sharon really wants
to be our surrogate.
Mr. and Mrs. Walker,

495
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:27,417
would you mind giving me
a moment alone with Sharon?

496
00:23:33,917 --> 00:23:36,041
You can't fix me, can you?

497
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:38,667
I'd have to do a hysteroscopy
and resect the scar,

498
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:40,500
but, yes, I can.

499
00:23:40,542 --> 00:23:42,041
That's--that's great.

500
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:45,041
But there are risks--bleeding,
a perforation, further injury.

501
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:47,041
And unless you're intent
on having another child,

502
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:49,041
there's no reason that you
should take those risks.

503
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:51,542
I really want to have
a baby for the walkers.

504
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:54,458
Are you especially close
to them?

505
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,041
We just met.

506
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:58,750
So are you doing it
for the money?
No.

507
00:23:58,792 --> 00:24:00,417
Then may I ask

508
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:03,041
why you're so interested
in helping them?

509
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:08,041
Because I know
what they're going through.

510
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:11,041
I lost a child, too,

511
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:13,458
the same way.

512
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,792
It's a horror show.

513
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:22,583
That maybe we could make
a little less horrific.

514
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:26,083
Why are you so intent
on helping these people?
Because I have to believe
in starting over.

515
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:28,041
There's always
a possibility.

516
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:30,458
Look, Addison,
it is a crappy world--

517
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,959
Amelia said that--
but I can't live with that.

518
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,250
With Dell and--and Maya
and William and Derek--

519
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:40,583
there has to be
a flip side to crappy.

520
00:24:40,625 --> 00:24:42,583
Why won't you help them?

521
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:45,750
Naomi, could we have
a minute, please?

522
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:55,041
I was there, Sheldon,
that day in the E.R.

523
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:56,792
It was unbearable.

524
00:24:56,834 --> 00:24:59,333
The father was destroyed,
the mother lost everything--

525
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:01,417
her baby and her faith
in her husband.

526
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,709
I mean, how can they
possibly move past that?

527
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,542
And they're both coming from
these terrible places,

528
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:07,333
moving as fast as they can,

529
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:09,125
trying to leave
the past behind them

530
00:25:09,166 --> 00:25:11,166
by making this huge commitment,
and--

531
00:25:11,208 --> 00:25:14,792
I was wondering why you were
so emotional about this.
Well, I just told you.

532
00:25:14,834 --> 00:25:17,542
No, Addison, I've spent enough
time in the elevator with you

533
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:20,291
to know that this about more
than must the walkers.
No, don't shrink me, Sheldon.

534
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:22,291
It doesn't require
a lot of shrinking.

535
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:25,417
People coming from bad places,
jumping into something fast.

536
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:27,041
N-No, no.

537
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:29,583
Pete chose Violet,
you chose Sam,

538
00:25:29,625 --> 00:25:31,417
which I realize
that I encouraged.

539
00:25:31,458 --> 00:25:33,417
In any event,
Pete and Violet worked out,

540
00:25:33,458 --> 00:25:35,792
you and Sam didn't.
Now they're getting married,

541
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:39,792
and... and you're the one
that's in a bad place.

542
00:25:39,834 --> 00:25:41,375
I'm fine.

543
00:25:41,417 --> 00:25:44,375
You will be. But the walkers?
They're fine right now.

544
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:47,000
Give them a chance, Addison.

545
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:55,166
I'm good at my job.

546
00:25:55,208 --> 00:25:58,041
Well, I was gonna ask
how everyone's feeling,

547
00:25:58,083 --> 00:26:00,792
but I think the better
question is, who's winning?

548
00:26:00,834 --> 00:26:03,208
We're not exactly there yet.
Ryan's teaching me
how to play.

549
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:07,458
Yeah.
Like this?

550
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,083
Mm-hmm.
Another one?

551
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:11,041
Hey.
King me.

552
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:14,667
You heard the man.
King him.
Once we get all better,
Ryan and me,

553
00:26:14,709 --> 00:26:18,041
we're gonna play together
all the time.
You two are gonna have
a regular checkers date?

554
00:26:18,083 --> 00:26:20,709
Yeah, we're gonna play
all the time at Ryan's house.

555
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,250
It's really big.
Mm.

556
00:26:22,291 --> 00:26:25,041
Yeah. There's a pool.
Sounds like he has big plans

557
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:28,041
for your future together.
He's getting
a little ahead of himself.

558
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:29,709
Yeah. He must be crazy

559
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,750
to think you'd put yourself
out for him

560
00:26:31,792 --> 00:26:33,750
after what he did for you.

561
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:35,458
Oh!

562
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,875
Dr. King, Ryan...

563
00:26:37,917 --> 00:26:39,834
Said that I could drive
his convertible.

564
00:26:39,875 --> 00:26:42,291
Hold on. I didn't say you could
drive the convertible.

565
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:45,667
No.
I said we would go driving
in the convertible.

566
00:26:45,709 --> 00:26:48,834
No. You--you said that
I could drive the convertible.
Aah! Oh!

567
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:51,125
Kevin, sit down.
Ah!

568
00:26:51,166 --> 00:26:53,125
Sit down!
Aah! Oh!

569
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:55,458
What did I do?
 You're bleeding into your abdomen.

570
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,125
I need some help in here!
I'm sorry. What did I do?

571
00:26:58,166 --> 00:27:00,542
Get him outta here.
What did I do?

572
00:27:00,583 --> 00:27:03,041
Take him back to his room. Go.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. What happened?

573
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:05,667
What did I do?
What did I do?

574
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:07,625
What did I do?!

575
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:13,917
So I talked
to the flower lady,

576
00:27:13,959 --> 00:27:17,917
and, uh, I have to leave
a message for the cake people.
I did that last night.

577
00:27:17,959 --> 00:27:20,917
Oh. I'm gonna have to get
a mani-pedi later.
I'm gonna have a drink
with Sam tonight

578
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:22,291
and just show up tomorrow.

579
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:25,291
I guess we have to figure out
what we're doing with Lucas.

580
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:27,166
Mm-hmm.

581
00:27:27,208 --> 00:27:29,083
Does it ever occur to you

582
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:30,709
that we're
doing everything backwards?

583
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:33,041
Baby first, wedding second.
Yeah. I mean, technically,

584
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:35,500
I've never actually been
on a date with you.
I'll take you on a date

585
00:27:35,542 --> 00:27:38,959
if I can make out with you
in my car after.
No, I'm serious.
You're supposed to date first,

586
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,041
and then that's how
you get to know someone.
We know each other.

587
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:44,959
So you're not worried about
spending forever with me?

588
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,125
Not really.
'Cause we're just kinda
jumping into this.

589
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:51,125
Look, you can never know
everything about someone,

590
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:53,041
but about me?

591
00:27:53,083 --> 00:27:54,792
You know enough.

592
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:08,333
Relax.

593
00:28:08,375 --> 00:28:10,041
It's gonna be great.

594
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:14,125
Over here!

595
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:18,625
Dink. School's over.

596
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:21,417
How come you're not home
with Maya and Olivia?

597
00:28:21,458 --> 00:28:24,583
We're kind of in the middle
of a game here, bro.
Your game's kinda over, bro.

598
00:28:24,625 --> 00:28:26,375
Dude.

599
00:28:26,417 --> 00:28:28,375
Get lost.

600
00:28:28,417 --> 00:28:31,625
You better
get out my face.

601
00:28:31,667 --> 00:28:33,375
Ready. Okay.

602
00:28:33,417 --> 00:28:36,041
Mrs. Bennett is different than
you. She doesn't want me around.

603
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:38,375
So what? What?
Yeah, so she's always
in my face,

604
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:41,041
telling me
I'm doing things wrong.

605
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:43,583
Then she just tells me
to go home.

606
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:45,291
All right. Let's play.

607
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:48,208

What happened?

650
00:30:37,083 --> 00:30:39,500
The kidney hemorrhaged
into your abdomen.

651
00:30:39,542 --> 00:30:41,125
How bad is that?

652
00:30:41,166 --> 00:30:43,542
Well, your body
rejected the kidney.

653
00:30:43,583 --> 00:30:46,166
