141
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,834
no. No, no, no.
It's not an issue.

supposed to be a noble calling,

148

always the case, you know?

149
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,583
There's only so much money,
and so much time,

150
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,667
and--and the real world
intrudes,

151
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:55,667
and, uh,
you have to compromise,

152
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:58,166
but now we don't have to.

153
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:02,875
Sam--when Sam and I were
first thinking about o.W.G.,

154
00:07:02,917 --> 00:07:04,875
we imagined a practice
where we could really

155
00:07:04,917 --> 00:07:08,417
get to know every single one
of our patients

156
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:11,208
and spend the time with them
that they need.

157
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,208
And now we can do that. We can
do anything and--and everything.

158
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,458
So...

159
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,875

I have no problem with it.

160
00:07:19,917 --> 00:07:22,667

all the time anyway,

162
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:28,041

00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,041

166
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,583
How's the pain?
Any better?

167
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:51,583
My migraine's gone.
I definitely feel more relaxed.

168
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,583
But I think
a big part of that

169
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,583
is that Dr. Freedman's
been watching Zack

00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,583

172
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:01,583
Yeah, he is. I love him. Just,
dealing with his autism is...

173
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,041

174
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,792
Well, he's getting bigger,

175
00:08:04,834 --> 00:08:07,375
so the fits are sometimes
hard to control.

176
00:08:07,417 --> 00:08:10,041
Sometimes it gets
a little scary.

177
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,166
I-I hate to say that,

178
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:15,208
you know, that sometimes
I'm afraid of my kid.
You're doing everything
you can for him, Sydney.

179
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,834
It's just important
to remember

180
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,834
to take care of yourself
as well.

181
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,166
Hi, sweetie.

182
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,083
How'd it go?

183
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,083
Great. I think
the new meds are working.

184
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,625
He's much calmer
than he was last week.

185
00:08:27,667 --> 00:08:29,125
I did notice that his eyes

186
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:32,333
are a little glassy. Has he
been running a fever or...
No.

187
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,291
Okay. Just to be
on the safe side,

188
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,291
I'd like to take some blood
and make sure

189
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,500
it's not an adverse reaction.
Oh, that's not necessary.

190
00:08:38,542 --> 00:08:40,792
We should get going.

191
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:43,125
Come on, baby.
Well, it's just a precaution.
It's not--

192
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:46,125
you're already here.
It'll just take a few minutes.

193
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,792
I can't. I just...

194
00:08:47,834 --> 00:08:51,125
Sydney, what's going on?

195
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:54,041
I stopped giving Zack
your pills.

196
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,041
Uh, may I ask why?

197
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,667
I've been giving him,
uh, the drug

198
00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:02,250
that Dr. Wilder prescribes
for my migraines.

199
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,792
Sydney, that is not
a good idea.

200
00:09:04,834 --> 00:09:07,417
Why? What have you
been giving him?

201
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:08,959
Marijuana.

202
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,500
Before you say anything,

203
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:22,041
I had no idea Sydney was
giving her pot to Zack.

204
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:25,166
Wh-why were you giving it
to her in the first place?
It was the only thing that
helped her chronic migraines.

205
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:27,709
Medicinal marijuana is legal in
the state of California, Cooper,

206
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,083
in case you missed the--
i--okay. Do you have any idea
what it would do

207
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,792
to an autistic 12 year old?
Okay, I know Sydney.
We know Sydney.

208
00:09:32,834 --> 00:09:35,083
She wouldn't do something like
this unless she was desperate.
I've been treating Zack
for over a year.

209
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,041
I know the challenges
she's facing,

210
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:40,041
but you're talking about a brain
that's still developing,

211
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:42,041
not to mention the risk of
addiction, increased anxiety--

212
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,834
maybe, but--
maybe? Are you gonna
condone this? Really?

213
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,875
I don't condone anyone
misusing any prescription.

214
00:09:46,917 --> 00:09:49,041
And giving it to her kid?
Of course not. I just--

215
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:50,458
I understand her dilemma.

216
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,250
Conventional treatments
have failed,

217
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,667
so now she's willing
to try anything.

218
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:56,667
I've seen the literature,
Pete.

219
00:09:56,709 --> 00:09:59,458
I know that there is
a small group of doctors

220
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,625
that say that it works
with autistic kids.

221
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,250
Okay. Then maybe it's time

222
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,875
for you to consider
the possibility--
no, what I was gonna say was,

223
00:10:05,917 --> 00:10:07,959
and I have treated kids
older than Zack,

224
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,959
healthy kids, that have ended up
with behavioral problems that--

225
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,959
I mean, there are so many
other therapies out there

226
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,667
that are proven to work better

227
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:16,667
without the possible
long-term side effects.

228
00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:19,709
Look, I don't like what Sydney
did any more than you do,

229
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,709
but maybe we need to keep
an open mind here.

230
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,709
If marijuana is helping Zack,

231
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,375
we owe it to both of them
to at least talk about it.

232
00:10:28,417 --> 00:10:31,542
Okay, the reason we decided to
keep our relationship a secret

233
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,375
had nothing to do
with Naomi.

234
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:36,375
Right? It's because we wanted
to give ourselves a chance to--

235
00:10:36,417 --> 00:10:38,375
to see what this...
You know, what we are.

236
00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:41,583
Yeah, but the merger means--
I know. I know
what the merger means.

237
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,583
I mean, god,
she's Naomi, Sam.

238
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,291
She's gonna be here all day.

239
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,291
She's gonna figure out
that we're together.

240
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,959
Which is why
we need to tell her.

241
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,709
Look, we know what we are.
All right?

242
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,083
We work.

243
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:58,083
As a couple, we work.

244
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,291
There's no reason
to hide this from her.

245
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:03,291
Maybe we wait
just a little while, though.

246
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,500
I mean, give her a chance
to grieve William.

247
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:07,500
You know, let her get
her feet back under her?

248
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:10,500
Do you want me to tell her?
If you're afraid, then I can--

249
00:11:10,542 --> 00:11:14,041
no, I'm not afraid.
I-I just--
wh--you just what?

250
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,709
Fine. I'll...
I'll tell her.

251
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,041
I can tell her.
No, I should.

252
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,792
I'll tell her about us.

253
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:27,041
When I wrote you
that prescription,

254
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:30,041
I assumed you would
use it responsibly.
Since when is a mother
helping her child irresponsible?

255
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,041
When it involves giving him
a drug--any drug--

256
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,041
not prescribed for him,

257
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,041
because along with
breaking the law,

258
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,291
you violated my trust.

259
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:42,041
I knew
you weren't gonna like it.

260
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:45,041
I just didn't feel like
I had a choice.

261
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,792
You have other options,
anti-hyperactivity meds.

262
00:11:47,834 --> 00:11:49,458
We tried those.
Behavioral therapies.

263
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,333
We gave up on that
two years ago. Come on.

264
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,333
Don't you think
I've tried everything,

265
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,166
read every book?

266
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,250
I'm sorry.
I'm just really tired.

267
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,875
I'm just tired.

268
00:12:02,917 --> 00:12:05,041
And, uh...

269
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,208
I don't know
how to do this anymore.

270
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,250
I don't know how to
get through the day.

271
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:11,208
Okay.

272
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,208
We'll come up with
another plan to help Zack.

273
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,667
When?

274
00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:16,667
Soon. I know how difficult
this is for you.

275
00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:18,834
Don't. Don't say that.

276
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,834
Do you have
an autistic child?

277
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,208
Have you ever even thought
what this is like

278
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,834
every single day?

279
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,041
You don't know.
Nobody knows.

280
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,917
I'm a single mother!

281
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:33,250
My husband left me because
he couldn't handle this.

282
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:36,500
You have no idea! You have
no idea how difficult this is!

283
00:12:36,542 --> 00:12:39,041
Get out!

284
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,500
What?

285
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:43,667
I won't give him your pot,
so you can go!

286
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:45,709
Okay?!

287
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,041
Holá, chica.

288
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,458
Why aren't you in Seattle?

289
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,458
Well, I got to the airport

290
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,875
and remembered
I'd already been there.

291
00:12:57,917 --> 00:12:59,875
So I went to Mexico instead.

292
00:12:59,917 --> 00:13:02,500
The plan was to see Derek
in Seattle.

293
00:13:02,542 --> 00:13:07,083
Yeah, well, plans change.
What'd I miss?

294
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:10,959
Well, Naomi wants
to merge the practices.

295
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,750
That's cool.

296
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:16,041
That's not cool?

297
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:21,041
Sam and I are a couple.

298
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,750
Go, Addison.

299
00:13:22,792 --> 00:13:25,125
I mean, is he as good in bed
as I think he is?

300
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,750
Because he has big hands.

301
00:13:26,792 --> 00:13:28,709
I mean, he has big,
gifted hands.

302
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,750
Shut up.

303
00:13:30,792 --> 00:13:32,750
Naomi doesn't know.
No one knows.

304
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:35,500
And I don't want to talk to you
about Sam's... hands.

305
00:13:35,542 --> 00:13:37,291
If I had that man in my bed,

306
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,291
I would be shouting it
from the rooftops.

307
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:42,000
I'd write a song.
Amelia, it's hard.

308
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,041
Yeah, it's hard.

309
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:48,208
Amelia, I need you to be
a grown-up here.

310
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,959
Okay.

311
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,959
You need to tell her...

312
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,792
Because she's
your best friend,

313
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,792
and not telling her...

314
00:13:57,834 --> 00:13:59,417
That's underestimating
your friendship.

315
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,750
What am I gonna say?

316
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:04,333
How about...
"Here's the deal, Nai.

317
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:05,959
"I'm banging Sam.

318
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,917
If you promise not to be mad,
I'll buy you a Gucci bag"?

319
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,583
Would--would you ever try
to bribe Derek?
If I thought it would work,

320
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,375
absolutely.

321
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,625
Fine.

322
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:19,041
I'm gonna tell her.

323
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:23,000
I'll just put it out there,
and... and see what happens.

324
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:28,625
S-So I woke up in a bed
full of cookie crumbs, right?

325
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:31,583
With my comparative lit prof
right--right next to me.

326
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,583
And...
The worst part was,

327
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,583
she still gave me a "c"
in the course.

328
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,208
That's nothing.
Sophomore year at college...

329
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,333
Yeah?

330
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,333
I went straight from
an all-night party

331
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:42,959
to the airport.

332
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I was supposed to go home
and see my family.

333
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,166
I got on the wrong plane.
I ended up in north Dakota.

334
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:49,834
What, you flew there direct?
I had to change planes.

335
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,875
What's so funny?

336
00:14:53,917 --> 00:14:55,250
He...

337
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:56,875
Ah, nothing. Nothing, man.

338
00:14:56,917 --> 00:14:58,625
You heard the man.

339
00:14:58,667 --> 00:15:01,041
Oh, Cooper told you.

340
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,000
Look, we are--
we are not here to judge.

341
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,000
No, but I might want to make

342
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,000
an appointment with you
for a prescription.

343
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,417
I have this ache in my back.

344
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:13,000
Hey, I was just looking
for you.

345
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:16,000
We have a little problem.
Is that a polite way
of you asking me

346
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,041
not to shave my legs
with your razor?

347
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,041
Well, I do want that.

348
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,041
But it's about Cooper.

349
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,417
You want to change Cooper?

350
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,041
You and Cooper, actually.

351
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,917
A little less you and Cooper.

352
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,291
N-Now come on, Violet.

353
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,291
He calls every morning.
He checks in after dinner.

354
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:33,542
So what?
It's only phone calls.
And texts and e-mails,

355
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:36,291
and he's on our couch
three nights a week watching TV.

356
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,291
Don't he and Charlotte
have cable?
Cooper is my friend.

357
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:41,041
Yeah, well, that's fine.
Oh, I'm so glad
to get your approval.

358
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:43,625
I just want to draw
some lines, and so--

359
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:46,834
no, no, you want to have
some control of my best friend.

360
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,208
A friend I understand.

361
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,208
But a guy who can't decide
what color boxers to wear

362
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,041
without consulting you first?

363
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,041
That I'm having
some trouble with.

364
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,500
You are so wrong.

365
00:15:55,542 --> 00:15:58,041
And besides,
Cooper wears briefs.

366
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,709
Hey, Mr. Pusher man.

367
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,250
Hey, uh, we're in the middle
of a conversation here, Cooper.

368
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,458
Oh, yeah? Is about, uh,
whether to prescribe pot to

369
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,667
an autistic 12 year old? 'Cause
I bet I know what you think.
What are you talking about?

370
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:11,166
I suggested we discuss it.
It's an adolescent
with developmental issues.

371
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,083
There's no discussion.
Nothing you're doing
is working.

372
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,709
You know what?
C-Can we take this down
a notch?

373
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,500
Okay, would you prescribe
medical marijuana to a patient

374
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:21,500
if you knew it would treat
their destructive behavior?
A 12-year-old patient,

375
00:16:21,542 --> 00:16:25,041
also knowing that it can
cause long-term problems.
I'm not getting
dragged into this.

376
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,959
Uh-huh.

377
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,125
Let him go.
It's his problem.

378
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,750
Until he calls,

379
00:16:30,792 --> 00:16:33,792
and I have to spend the rest of
the night on the phone with him.

380
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,208
Hey. There you are.

381
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,542
Hey.

382
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:41,750
Um, I, uh, I-I followed up
with Pete about the merger.

383
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,125
And he just keeps saying,

384
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:45,125
you know, "it sounds good,
sounds good."

385
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:47,333
So I-I don't know.
I guess that means that it--

386
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,333
sounds good to him?
Yeah.

387
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,333
You know, Charlotte and Cooper
don't seem to care.

388
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,333
And--and Sheldon's more excited
about the fact

389
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:55,333
that there's a cookie drawer
up here

390
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:58,166
than a possibility
of a 2-shrink practice.

391
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,166
I...

392
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:01,041
Did you expect
more resistance?

393
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,583
I don't--i don't know.

394
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:04,583
I-I guess I've been
so overwhelmed

395
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,041
with everything
that's happened lately,

396
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,583
I-I don't know.

397
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,583
I'm just--
I guess I'm just waiting

398
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,583
to get hit
with something else.

399
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,000
Huh.

400
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,667
What's wrong?
Nothing.

401
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:16,667
That's not
a "nothing's wrong" face, Addie.

402
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:18,166
What's wrong?

403
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:19,709
No, I, uh...

404
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,709
I-I just wanted
to tell you that...

405
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,834
I'm sorry...

406
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,208
About William.

407
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,250
He was an amazing guy.

408
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,834
Yeah, he was.

409
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:37,500
You know, there's not
too many of those around.

410
00:17:37,542 --> 00:17:39,417
No, there aren't.

411
00:17:49,959 --> 00:17:51,917
So... about Jane Finch.

412
00:17:51,959 --> 00:17:54,875
I know you're experienced
with these types of cases,

413
00:17:54,917 --> 00:17:57,291
and I appreciate it.
I'd like to see her again.

414
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:58,917
Well, as I understand it,

415
00:17:58,959 --> 00:18:01,041
she's already done
the mandated therapy.

416
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,417
I just need a second
psychiatrist to sign off

417
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:06,125
to meet the standard of care
requirement.
Well,
I'm not a rubber stamp.

418
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,542
You really have
a problem here?

419
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:11,041
Jane cut her wrists,
which on its own

420
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:13,458
doesn't necessarily
disqualify her,

421
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,458
but the explanation
she gave her first therapist,

422
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,041
she repeated it to me verbatim.
Points off for consistency?

423
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,458
No, for being rehearsed.

424
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,041
She came into my office,
she had all the right answers,

425
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:24,041
including about
the suicide attempt.

426
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:27,750
And you think
she's hiding something?
I need to know
that she isn't.

427
00:18:27,792 --> 00:18:30,041
Her "up with people" attitude
notwithstanding,

428
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:32,041
unless Jane is stable
with a realistic appreciation

429
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,875
not only of who she is
but who she's going to become,

430
00:18:34,917 --> 00:18:39,041
gender reassignment surgery
can do more harm than good.
Now isn't that a lot
to ask of someone

431
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,875
who feels like they're trapped
in the wrong body?

432
00:18:41,917 --> 00:18:44,458
It's like demanding
a sick person get well

433
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,041
before you give 'em
the medication they need.
Look, I'm not saying no.

434
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,041
But this isn't a boob job
or a tummy tuck.

435
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,041
We're looking at a surgery
that is fundamentally

436
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:53,542
gonna change
who Jane is forever.
A surgery
that she desperately wants,

437
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:56,125
that she's done everything she's
supposed to to get ready for,

438
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,750
and that's scheduled
for the day after tomorrow.

439
00:18:58,792 --> 00:19:00,834
Surgical team is prepped
and ready to go.

440
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,875
Well, apologies
if my professional judgment

441
00:19:02,917 --> 00:19:05,750
is inconveniencing you, okay?

442
00:19:05,792 --> 00:19:07,542
Is it your professional
judgment, Sheldon?

443
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,542
Or are you just
making this difficult

444
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:12,542
because I picked Cooper
instead of you?

445
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,333
You should understand
two things.

446
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,125
First, I'm right about Jane.

447
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,041
Second, we can be
good colleagues

448
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:21,291
without being good friends
or really just friends at all.

449
00:19:31,792 --> 00:19:33,125
Hi.

450
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,041
I did what Dr. Wilder said.

451
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:37,333
He told me not to give him
pot anymore, and I didn't.

452
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,959
And I threw out what I had left,
but look at him.

453
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,750
He's worse than before.
This is probably
a reaction to him

454
00:19:42,792 --> 00:19:45,625
coming off the drug
so quickly.
I can't, uh,
I can't do this anymore.

455
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:47,625
I need to know this plan.
Which plan?

456
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:50,000
Dr. Wilder, he--he came over
earlier, and he said

457
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:53,041
that you were gonna
find a way to help us.

458
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,166
No, Zack.

459
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:57,375
Hey, Zack. Okay, okay.

460
00:19:57,417 --> 00:19:59,000
Zack, come here.

461
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:02,166
Okay. No one's gonna hurt you,
but you have to take it easy.

462
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:05,375
I got you.
Please give him the marijuana.
It worked. It helped him.

463
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:08,542
We'll find another treatment,
okay?
No, but that could take weeks
to see results.

464
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,542
I need help now.
We'll get through it.

465
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:13,166
No, we won't. I won't.

466
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,542
Please just give him
the drugs.

467
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:18,166
I'm sorry. I can't do that.

468
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:19,583
Aah!

469
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,250
You told me
this skirt worked,

470
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:23,834
so I know I'm not back here
for any bad news

471
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:27,417
after my session with that
cute little head shrinker.

472
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:30,625
Please, no.

473
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,625
Dr. Wallace is concerned

474
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:36,625
that you told him what
you thought he'd want to hear.

475
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:39,208
And that makes me crazy?

476
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,375
Then tell me what to do.

477
00:20:42,417 --> 00:20:45,166
Stop pretending
what you're going through

478
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,166
isn't painful and lonely.

479
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,709
I can't do that,

480
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,709
because the one time...

481
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,834
I gave in
and really let myself

482
00:20:55,875 --> 00:21:00,500
think about what my life
has been up to now...

483
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:04,208

You can't fool him, Jane.

489
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:17,834
I don't want to fool him.

490
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:21,542
I want him to understand
that the pain...

491
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,083
And the loneliness

492
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:25,917
are not me.

493
00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:29,041

Hey. I was wondering
where you were.

502
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:56,000
Hey.

503
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:59,750
Yeah, I left work early
so I could, uh, take a run.

504
00:21:59,792 --> 00:22:02,917
That's a long run.
Yeah, I, uh...
Lot to think about.

505
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:05,041
You're mad.

506
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:07,583
I'm disappointed.

507
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,583
I was going to tell her.

508
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,041
I was.

509
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:13,959
Look, there's never gonna be
a right time, Addison.

510
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,166
So either you tell her
or...

511
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:18,792
Or what?

512
00:22:18,834 --> 00:22:21,041
Are you threatening me?

513
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:22,625

will be different?

606
00:26:19,667 --> 00:26:21,166
I think...

607
00:26:21,208 --> 00:26:23,834
People will finally see me
the way I see myself.

608
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:26,208
I'll be able to bond
with women

609
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,041
and flirt with men

610
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:32,041
instead of feeling
socially homeless.

611
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:34,458
Maybe one day
I'll even fall in love

612
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,792
and have someone
love me back.

613
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,458
And you think a surgery
can give you all that?

614
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,041
Do you know the expression

615
00:26:45,083 --> 00:26:48,000
"you take yourself
wherever you go"?

616
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:53,500
I'm not myself,
Dr. Wallace, not yet.

617
00:26:53,542 --> 00:26:56,375
And you think that Dr. King
can help you with that

618
00:26:56,417 --> 00:26:58,375
more than I can?

619
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:01,667
I knew there was something
between you two.

620
00:27:01,709 --> 00:27:05,000
I just didn't think it was
a competition.

621
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:07,000
What you've been through
is very painful.

622
00:27:07,041 --> 00:27:09,542
And there's no shame
in that.

623
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:12,166
But to get past it, to get
comfortable with who you are

624
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:15,041
and who you want to be, you have
to work through the pain,

625
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:17,000
not smile through it.

626
00:27:20,083 --> 00:27:22,166

629
00:27:26,417 --> 00:27:28,375
my father kicked me out
of the house

630
00:27:28,417 --> 00:27:30,417
after he caught me trying on
my mother's bra...

631
00:27:30,458 --> 00:27:33,542
Or the first time I went home
with a man and got beaten up

632
00:27:33,583 --> 00:27:36,166
after he found out
what I thought he already knew.

633
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:38,166
We can talk about
the jobs I haven't gotten

634
00:27:38,208 --> 00:27:39,792
or the friends I've lost.

635
00:27:39,834 --> 00:27:42,333
Just... tell me

All of it.

637
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:49,625
You're not
gonna let me have the surgery,

638
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:51,625
are you?

639
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:53,417
Not yet.

640
00:27:58,125 --> 00:28:01,000
Hey, I got your text.

641
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:03,667
Yeah, um... so I spent
an hour yesterday

642
00:28:03,709 --> 00:28:06,000
wrestling Zack
to the ground.
Oh, is he okay?

643
00:28:06,041 --> 00:28:08,041
Well, pot or no pot, his
emotions are all over the place.

644
00:28:08,083 --> 00:28:10,083
I gave him a sedative
to calm him down

645
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:12,250
so Sydney could take him home.

646
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:14,458
But while I am trying to find
a long-term solution,

647
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,458
you're promising her
a quick fix.

648
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,875
Uh, no. What I said was, you
would find a way to help Zack.

649
00:28:19,917 --> 00:28:21,542
Pardon me

650
00:28:21,583 --> 00:28:25,041
for having some confidence
in your medical abilities.
Stop meddling.

651
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:27,667
Stop barging in.

652
00:28:27,709 --> 00:28:29,041
What?

653
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:31,166
Give me your key
to the house, Cooper.

654
00:28:31,208 --> 00:28:33,166
Forget it.
Violet gave it to me.

655
00:28:33,208 --> 00:28:35,458
She's the only one
who can ask for it back.

656
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,291
Oh, for god sake.
Would you grow up, Cooper?
Believe me, I'll be sure
to knock next time.

657
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:39,917
The image of your ass

658
00:28:39,959 --> 00:28:42,166
is permanently
burned into my retinas.

659
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:45,166
And I'll grow the hell up
when you do.
No. Uh, you grow up first,
and then I will grow up.

660
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:47,166
No, you grow up first.
No, you grow up first.

661
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:49,250
Just grow up.
If you grow up,
I'll grow up.

662
00:28:49,291 --> 00:28:50,875
No, grow up first...

663
00:28:50,917 --> 00:28:52,875
I don't know whether
to give them boxing gloves

664
00:28:52,917 --> 00:28:55,875
or a time-out.
Well, I know that Pete
can take a punch.

665
00:28:55,917 --> 00:28:58,041
Well, lately he can't take
anything coming from Cooper.

666
00:28:58,083 --> 00:29:01,500
Yeah, I heard about
the ass incident.
It was not a big deal.

667
00:29:01,542 --> 00:29:03,583
Well, it wasn't your ass.
He cannot tell me
what to do.

668
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:05,583
My parents did that
to each other, and i--

669
00:29:05,625 --> 00:29:07,041
I hated it.

670
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:10,041
He's the man you love.
He's asking you to do something

671
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:11,709
that's very important to him.

672
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,291
That's the thing
about relationships--

673
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:16,375
even if it's not your ass,
you still have to care.

674
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,542
You either have something
against Jane

675
00:29:21,583 --> 00:29:23,542
or something against me,
because that woman

676
00:29:23,583 --> 00:29:26,333
is damned if she does and damned
if she doesn't with you.
I want to help her.

677
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:29,125
Then sign off
on me doing the surgery.
You can give her
what she wants, yes,

678
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:31,542
but not what she needs.
I can change her life

679
00:29:31,583 --> 00:29:34,041
in a way no amount
of jawboning ever will.

680
00:29:34,083 --> 00:29:35,417
You really think so?

681
00:29:35,458 --> 00:29:37,917
A few flicks of a scalpel,
reroute a little plumbing,

682
00:29:37,959 --> 00:29:40,041
and all of the insecurity
and self-loathing

683
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:42,583
that built up over her whole
lifetime just--just disappears?

684
00:29:42,625 --> 00:29:44,875
At least it's a start.

685
00:29:44,917 --> 00:29:47,000
Why are you
so invested in Jane?

686
00:29:49,917 --> 00:29:52,875
I grew up with a daddy
who told me how sweet I was,

687
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:55,875
taking care of two little
brothers who still depend on me.

688
00:29:55,917 --> 00:29:57,875
And I became a doctor

689
00:29:57,917 --> 00:30:00,917
because I couldn't imagine
anything better than a job

690
00:30:00,959 --> 00:30:04,583
where, every day,
you got to help people.

691
00:30:06,583 --> 00:30:08,041
But somehow along the way,

692
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:11,041
I developed a reputation
as being cold and unemotional,

693
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:12,917
and now I'm the bitch.

694
00:30:12,959 --> 00:30:14,041
Charlotte--

695
00:30:14,083 --> 00:30:16,500
you gonna tell me
it's not the case?

696
00:30:17,959 --> 00:30:20,125
I'm not asking you
to cry for me, Sheldon.

697
00:30:20,166 --> 00:30:23,125
I'm just asking you to help me
spare someone more pain.

698
00:30:23,166 --> 00:30:26,000
Jane's had way more
than her share in this life.

699
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:29,041
What?

700
00:30:29,083 --> 00:30:32,834
You keep showing off
your humanity like that...

701
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:35,250
We might actually
become friends again.

702
00:30:39,041 --> 00:30:41,041
What happened?

703
00:30:41,083 --> 00:30:43,083
He started again.
He flew into a rage.

704
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:45,959
He started himself
and hitting me.
Did you give him
anything, Sydney?

705
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,792
I just--
I couldn't handle it anymore.
What'd you give him?

706
00:30:48,834 --> 00:30:52,041
I bought some weed
off the street.
Tox screen positive
for phencyclidine.

707
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:55,041
What's happening?
What's happening?
The marijuana you gave him
was laced with p.C.P.

708
00:30:55,083 --> 00:30:57,959
B.P.'S 180 over 120.
He's in hypertensive crisis.

709
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,041
No.
Give him 5 of lorazepam
and start him on a nipride drip.

710
00:31:00,083 --> 00:31:02,625
It looked the same as the stuff
that I got from Dr. Wilder.

711
