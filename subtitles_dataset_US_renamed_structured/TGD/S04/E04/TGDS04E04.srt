1
00:00:04,805 --> 00:00:07,502
<i>Move from Bhujangasana</i>

2
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:10,543
<i>into Adho Mukha Svanasana.</i>

3
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:12,545
<i>And hold that.</i>

4
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:14,979
- Do you like this?
- Mm...

5
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,245
I'm not sure.

6
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:19,713
I like that you like it.

7
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:23,062
Time for work.

8
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:29,323
Guess we'll finish Vinyasa
flow next time I come over.

9
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:31,365
You shouldn't come over anymore.

10
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,368
You should move in.

11
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:39,039
Things are different now.

12
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:41,701
You lived here before.
What's different?

13
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:44,108
Everything is different.

14
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:46,442
Then we were
roomies, pals, buddies,

15
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:48,880
and now we're a real thing.

16
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:53,011
A better thing for sure,
but also more complicated.

17
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:56,853
We're the same people in the
same place doing the same things.

18
00:00:56,924 --> 00:00:59,792
It's bigger than that, Shaun.

19
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:00,919
I hope it is.

20
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:06,092
I... Living together means
more commitment, more trust.

21
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:09,899
And I don't think
we're quite there yet.

22
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:12,402
You don't trust me?

23
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:14,407
No, I do, it's just...

24
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,905
I need a bit more.

25
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,716
Copernicus1543.

26
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,120
It's my banking password.

27
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,170
- Yes, I got you!
- No!

28
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:51,541
- Bow to your queen.
- No, bitch!

29
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:52,612
- Yes!
- No!

30
00:01:56,183 --> 00:02:00,018
Ahh, where did you find the
10,000 hours that you put into that?

31
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,957
I like filling my evenings
with numbing mindlessness.

32
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:04,957
Mm.

33
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:06,025
Oh.

34
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:10,696
Morgan needs me to go in ASAP.

35
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:12,323
You figure she
shouldn't page you?

36
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:13,731
She can handle it on her own

37
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,235
because she used to
be a surgical resident?

38
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:17,635
Be the bigger person.

39
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,468
It's an ingrown hair.

40
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:21,741
Mm.

41
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,245
Definitely an ingrown hair.

42
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:28,373
Unfortunately, the ingrown
hair caused an abscess

43
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:29,448
that needs to be lanced.

44
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,212
By a surgeon.

45
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:34,384
Please give this man
the VIP treatment.

46
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:38,150
I have another case to attend to,
but don't worry, I'll be checking in.

47
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,699
- Such a nice lady.
- Hmm.

48
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:48,668
So how shall we proceed?

49
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,938
I'm going with drain the
abscess and dress the wound.

50
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:53,639
Set it up.

51
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:56,704
Maybe we should do a biopsy?

52
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:02,142
Well, it could be a cutaneous pili
migrans or have a deep sinus tract

53
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:04,980
or a creeping eruption
caused by a parasitic disease.

54
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,183
Give him the VIP treatment.

55
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,351
Abdominal pain can be
scary when you're pregnant.

56
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:16,022
But I wouldn't worry. You
have two rambunctious boys.

57
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,258
I know. It's like a
cage match in here.

58
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:21,577
- Shaun, where's your first-year resident?
- I have two first-year residents.

59
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:24,264
But I don't want to teach
them. They're very distracting.

60
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:28,638
You have a dizygotic,
dichorionic, diamniotic pregnancy.

61
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:32,111
It just means your twins are
fraternal and in separate amniotic sacs.

62
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:34,139
First-years aren't
distractions. They're godsends.

63
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:35,308
She has edema.

64
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,942
Not surprising for someone
who's 26 weeks pregnant.

65
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:39,611
Look, they'll do
anything you want.

66
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:42,121
Scut work, follow-ups,
coffee runs...

67
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:44,215
- I don't like coffee.
- Laundry, apple runs...

68
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:45,452
I already did that.

69
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:49,787
- What was her BP?
- Normal.

70
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:53,027
BP's no longer normal.
She's hypertensive.

71
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,864
What does that mean, Dr. Murray?

72
00:03:57,938 --> 00:04:00,931
- Is your vision blurred?
- A bit. I'm tired.

73
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,441
Sounds like preeclampsia.

74
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:07,538
If we don't get your BP down
ASAP, you could lose your pregnancy.

75
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:21,659
We need to start you on
antihypertensive meds,

76
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,822
but your edema makes
it difficult to place an IV,

77
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:26,025
so we need to
run a central line.

78
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:30,600
Dr. Jackson?

79
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,351
Mind if I give a
hand, Dr. Murphy?

80
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,149
Mm.

81
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:05,928
- Is there anyone you want us to call?
- Uh...

82
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:10,974
My boyfriend decided his obligations
ended at offering to pay for an abortion.

83
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:15,141
Soft man in a hard world.

84
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,252
Fetal heart rate's dropping.

85
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:21,616
But only one of them.

86
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,926
- Did you have another birth?
- No.

87
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:31,556
Any pregnancy?
Miscarriage, abortion, stillbirth?

88
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,692
I had an abortion when I was 15.

89
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:36,568
It's not preeclampsia.

90
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:40,630
One fetus is Rh-positive,
and the mother is Rh-negative,

91
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,835
and her body is
perceiving him as a threat

92
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,775
and attacking him
with antibodies.

93
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:48,680
Antibodies she could only have
if she had an earlier pregnancy.

94
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:52,076
My body is trying to
kill one of my babies?

95
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,080
Yes.

96
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,226
Waiting on Billy's
biopsy results?

97
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,354
To confirm an ingrown hair?

98
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,066
You grew up in a
Hasidic family, right?

99
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,535
How are they handling
you being a doctor?

100
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,174
I haven't spoken to them in...

101
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:20,610
four years, except one sister.

102
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,445
I chose not to live
by their rules. I...

103
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:29,582
I knew the consequences.

104
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:34,651
My dad was a real-estate agent obsessed
with two completely unrelated things,

105
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:36,493
teeth and taxes.

106
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,759
Thought I'd spend the rest
of my life selling condos.

107
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:41,893
Now I'm a surfing surgeon,
but I still floss three times a day

108
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:43,800
and pay my installments
four times a year.

109
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:46,201
So, what's my dental floss?

110
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:48,374
Fire and brimstone.

111
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:53,469
Mm, actually, that is
from the New Testament.

112
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:56,874
I don't even know
what brimstone is.

113
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:00,650
I meant you fear disaster.

114
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:04,318
Your people's history
is kind of filled with it.

115
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,292
Billy has cancer.

116
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,496
How are your first-years doing?

117
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:22,667
Jordan talks too much,
and Olivia talks too little.

118
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:26,474
And Olivia does not know
where the jugular vein is.

119
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,675
You see her résumé?

120
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:32,412
Her grades and USMLE
scores were nearly perfect.

121
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:35,512
So if it's not a lack of
knowledge, what do you think it is?

122
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,926
I think Olivia has the potential
to be an exemplary doctor

123
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:42,326
if you push her, give
her a little extra attention.

124
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:45,764
Isn't that unfair to Jordan?

125
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,666
Well, was it unfair to the applicant
who didn't get your position

126
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:52,536
because Dr. Glassman thought
that you needed some extra attention?

127
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:57,635
Olivia just doesn't like being
in the spotlight, that's all.

128
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:01,876
Olivia's résumé didn't say
anything about not liking the spotlight.

129
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:04,543
Exactly. Don't trust résumés.

130
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:09,713
<i>Locate jugular vein.</i>

131
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:14,425
Insert needle.

132
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:18,932
Get a venous blush, remove
syringe, leaving needle in,

133
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,628
- then thread...
- Thread wire into needle.

134
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:28,304
Remove needle, scalpel to skin,

135
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:33,336
while being aware of a persistent
left-sided superior vena cava placement

136
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:36,508
present in 4% of those with
congenital heart disease.

137
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:42,585
Remove wire, suture
in line to skin, and done.

138
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,427
I guess you were nervous before.

139
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,693
- Didn't you have first-case jitters?
- No.

140
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:59,838
The sick twin has gone
into severe distress.

141
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:11,874
You have amelanotic
melanoma. Skin cancer.

142
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:15,918
But there's good news. We
should be able to remove all of it.

143
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:17,850
We can do it today.

144
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:19,916
Sorry, car trouble.

145
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:24,289
Hi, Dr. Park. Just telling
Billy about his cancer.

146
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,731
I got a great mechanic for you.

147
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:31,602
If you tell her Billy sent you,
she'll give you a friends-and-family.

148
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:34,300
Okay. Thanks for that.

149
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:36,866
You have an amazing attitude.

150
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:39,640
You know, my wife used
to tease me about that.

151
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,779
She died three years ago.

152
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:44,616
I'm sorry.

153
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:49,416
You know, on our
second date, I got a flat.

154
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:52,454
Now, I think she thought
I was gonna curse,

155
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,118
but all I could say was:

156
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:57,722
"Good timing. Costco's
got a sale on tires."

157
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:03,463
It's Addy's Auto, Los
Gatos and Gateway.

158
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,745
We are through the uterine wall.

159
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:15,644
Dr. Jackson, what's
our next step?

160
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:20,177
Advance through the trocar
15 millimeters beyond the tip

161
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:24,281
until the opening of the distal
basket can be confirmed by ultrasound.

162
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:29,285
Exactly.

163
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:32,522
What would you like me
to advance, Dr. Jackson?

164
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,159
Oh. Yes, right.

165
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:38,535
Obviously, you would be advancing
the double basket rocket catheter

166
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:39,605
and not this.

167
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,540
Sorry.

168
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,171
Not your fault.

169
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:47,942
If a junior resident is ill-prepared,
that's on the senior resident.

170
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:56,423
How is it fair that I get blamed
for a first-year's mistake,

171
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,482
and how can I help that person
without being unfair to the other one?

172
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:01,960
And how fair was the
preferential treatment

173
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:02,927
that you gave me,

174
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:06,091
and how fair was it to
the other first-year resident

175
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,965
who didn't get placed because
you helped me, and how fair was...?

176
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:11,527
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Put the list down.

177
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:15,272
Only four questions at
a time. That's my limit.

178
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,040
What kind of mistake?

179
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,174
Even though I went over
the procedure with Olivia,

180
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:24,012
she still gave
Dr. Andrews the pusher rod

181
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:27,747
when he needed the rocket
catheter, and he said it was my fault.

182
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,015
It was your fault.

183
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:31,891
You gotta help
her a little more.

184
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:36,018
- That is not fair to Jordan.
- What does fairness have to do with it?

185
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:37,461
It's not about equality.

186
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,692
It's about figuring out
what each person needs

187
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:41,826
and then teaching
them how to get it.

188
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:44,496
How do I know what they need?

189
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:48,338
Well, you've taught
them medicine, right?

190
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:52,209
So maybe it's something else.
Maybe it's an emotional issue.

191
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:55,112
Then I definitely can't
give them what they need.

192
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:56,581
You can ask them.

193
00:11:56,649 --> 00:12:00,814
- About their emotions?
- Yeah. Ask them how they feel.

194
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:03,721
I don't care how they feel.

195
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,816
That's the beauty of it.
You don't have to care.

196
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,861
You just have to ask
them how they really feel.

197
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:11,694
Then they start talking.
Because people love to talk.

198
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:26,208
Oh. Oh.

199
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,440
Have you been working out?

200
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,878
I could only find mediums.

201
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:34,413
You know how many sets
of large scrubs I had to hide?

202
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:35,487
Thirty-one.

203
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:41,219
Injecting dye.

204
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:51,662
BP's dropping, diffuse skin
flushing. He's in anaphylactic shock.

205
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:53,900
- He's allergic to the dye.
- Ten cc epinephrine.

206
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:58,474
BP barely measurable. We
should intubate. Initiate CPR.

207
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:02,006
You should cannulate his femoral
vein to give pressers and volume.

208
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,406
Let's intubate and cannulate.

209
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:11,249
His jugular's distended.

210
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:14,294
Maybe he has cardiac tamponade
from a pericardial effusion.

211
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,919
He might need
open heart surgery.

212
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:18,328
Worst-case scenario
worked out the first time.

213
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:20,342
- Think lightning's gonna strike twice?
- Maybe not,

214
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:23,063
but I'm not gonna stand
on a hill in a thunderstorm.

215
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:26,504
Let's call Lim.

216
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:28,473
Prep the patient
for a pericardiotomy.

217
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,000
Two for two.

218
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:44,953
Okay, you can't do yoga at work.

219
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:47,016
I do it at home.
What's the difference?

220
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:51,289
Work behavior is not the
same as home behavior.

221
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:55,028
Ooh. So you're
saying context matters.

222
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:56,101
Of course.

223
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,233
The same way that two
roommates living together

224
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:02,002
is different from a
couple living together.

225
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:06,635
Same people, same
place, different context.

226
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:13,810
Once our feelings change,
everything changes.

227
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:20,183
I still feel the same
way when I'm with you.

228
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,194
Happy.

229
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,273
Kenzie's BP and
edema have improved.

230
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:38,941
The fetus's echo shows
improved heart function.

231
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:40,707
Catheter's working.

232
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:44,548
How do you feel?

233
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:47,018
Okay.

234
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,786
How do you really feel?

235
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:55,394
Uh...

236
00:14:55,962 --> 00:14:57,055
Really okay.

237
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:04,442
You wanna know why
I'm so nervous all the time?

238
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,302
I don't know.

239
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:14,313
I've always been
very terrified of firsts.

240
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:17,477
First day of school,
camp, church.

241
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,611
All the new faces watching me,
just waiting for me to screw up.

242
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:23,948
First day of fifth grade,

243
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,652
when Mrs. Deloitte asked
me what six times nine was,

244
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:28,888
I told the whole
class it was 45.

245
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:32,326
Yeah, I can still hear
them laughing at me.

246
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,066
Two nights ago,

247
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:38,229
I dreamt I was standing in front
of Mrs. Deloitte's class again.

248
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:39,602
Couldn't wait to wake up.

249
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:43,905
But when I did, I realized that
if I got the answer wrong today,

250
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:46,468
no one will laugh,
but someone may die.

251
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:52,247
Kids laughed at me too.

252
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:57,087
Even though I knew
six times nine was 54.

253
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,491
One of the amniotic sacs
ruptured. The strong twin's.

254
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:13,367
It's metastasized to his
liver. So, what do we do?

255
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:16,805
Laparoscopic
radiofrequency ablation.

256
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:17,876
Short recovery time,

257
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:19,776
but a significant chance
his cancer returns.

258
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:20,846
Care to rebut?

259
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:26,984
I think we should consider
a hepatic lobectomy

260
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:28,612
and lymph node dissection.

261
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:31,266
Remove the affected area of
the liver, all the surrounding tissue,

262
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,054
and every swollen node we find.

263
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,889
And that's the
aggressive approach.

264
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:38,159
Longer recovery time, high
risk of complications, and, uh...

265
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,190
admittedly the best shot
at beating the cancer.

266
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:43,964
By complications, you mean
a barely functioning liver,

267
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:46,198
a persistent threat of fatal
bleeds, and chronic pain.

268
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:48,969
As surgeons you can gut
him, but as his primary doctor,

269
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,738
I have to find the balance
between longevity and quality of life.

270
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:54,303
Last week you were trying to
perform surgery from the gallery,

271
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,746
and now you hate surgeons?

272
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:57,349
Pick a side.

273
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,410
A piecemeal approach is
not going to work with Billy.

274
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:03,547
Every time we try to solve a
problem, we discover another one.

275
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:05,785
You may have left
your religion in Brooklyn,

276
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,803
but you keep looking for
meaning in random events.

277
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:10,105
- Dice have no memory.
- I'm not looking for meaning.

278
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:11,129
I'm looking for patterns.

279
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:13,359
Maybe he's got some
underlying condition?

280
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:15,531
I agree with Asher.

281
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,900
The dice have no memory,
but they can be loaded.

282
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:22,369
So safe and
seriously compromised

283
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,376
or aggressive and possibly dead?

284
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:28,874
Your case, Dr. Browne.

285
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:31,917
Your call.

286
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:43,090
How are you feeling?

287
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,523
You've sacrificed a lot.
Your hands, your career.

288
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,798
And you're taking it out on me and
Claire and the whole surgical profession.

289
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,032
And I get it. It hurts.

290
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,439
You're pathetic.

291
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:59,036
You're worried about me because
I'll never be a surgeon? Boo-hoo.

292
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:00,044
You're worried about me

293
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:02,445
because I took pleasure in
screwing with you and Claire?

294
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:03,515
That's who I am.

295
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:05,880
The question is, who are you?

296
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:07,887
You don't show up late
with lame-ass excuses,

297
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:10,150
and when you get
dissed, you diss back, so...

298
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,558
how are you feeling?

299
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:14,855
Forget I asked.

300
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:23,561
He's lost most of his amniotic
fluid. Won't last very long in utero.

301
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:28,098
In helping the weak, we
hurt the strong. C-section?

302
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:30,609
If we do a C-section
to save the strong baby,

303
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:33,077
there's a 90% chance
the weak baby will die.

304
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:36,377
But if we do an amnioinfusion
to save the weak baby,

305
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:39,908
there's an 85% chance
that strong baby will die.

306
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:42,148
It's the better option.

307
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:46,685
Five percent to decide
which baby lives?

308
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,955
Kenzie's body has
already made that choice.

309
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:52,465
If there's a strong baby and a weak
baby, it's pretty clear which one we save.

310
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:53,760
Survival of the fittest.

311
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:57,834
Sorry, it's just...

312
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:02,833
That's not really what we're
about, is it, as a civilization?

313
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:05,309
Aren't the strong morally
obligated to help the weak?

314
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:08,610
And if they don't, isn't
everybody ultimately worse off?

315
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:13,218
Neither baby has to die.

316
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:16,779
Delayed interval delivery.

317
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:19,849
We induce labor,
deliver the strong twin,

318
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,394
then stop the labor to
keep the weak twin in utero

319
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:23,724
until his lungs mature.

320
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:26,561
The chances of stopping
labor are very slim.

321
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:27,632
That's true.

322
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,829
There's about a 70% chance
that both babies would die.

323
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,804
Which makes it the
worst possible choice.

324
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,532
- We need to ask Kenzie.
- No, we don't.

325
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,336
Once she hears there's
the slightest chance

326
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:39,674
of saving both babies,

327
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:41,407
she won't listen
to any alternatives.

328
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,473
Statistically, it's
a terrible option.

329
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:47,713
But it is an option.

330
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:02,531
No. No, you can't
seriously be asking me this.

331
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:05,765
I know that this is something no
mother should ever have to decide.

332
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,972
There are no good options
here, but there is one

333
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,773
that will most likely make you
the mother of a healthy baby boy.

334
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:21,747
Okay.

335
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,789
- Prep for an amnioinfusion...
- Have you named them?

336
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:27,887
Dr. Allen.

337
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,128
Braydon and...

338
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:40,772
Landon.

339
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:46,778
No. No, I can't do this.

340
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:51,776
You have to save both of them.

341
00:20:55,521 --> 00:20:56,921
We're at the tumor.

342
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:59,521
Unipolar ablation probe?

343
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:02,537
Pretty cool to think
we diagnosed Billy

344
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:05,241
with metastatic melanoma on Tuesday
and send him home on a Thursday.

345
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,327
Well, let's wait till Friday
to congratulate ourselves.

346
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:13,133
Current at 480 hertz, please.

347
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:18,436
Wait. We got a leak, bile duct.

348
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:21,413
Suction, suture,
linear stapler, stat.

349
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:41,189
I believe she made
the right choice.

350
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:42,867
She made the choice
any mother would make

351
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:44,597
because the alternative
is unthinkable.

352
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,436
Isn't that exactly what
made it the right choice?

353
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:48,997
She has to live with it.

354
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,407
The safe choice is not
always the best choice.

355
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,970
If it were, I'd be on an
army base in Germany,

356
00:21:55,948 --> 00:21:58,440
married to First Lieutenant
Dwayne Buckman.

357
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:07,624
Dr. Andrews, you
wanted to see me?

358
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:10,720
Yes, Dr. Jackson.
Please come in.

359
00:22:13,766 --> 00:22:15,530
Dr. Jackson.

360
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:17,900
I cannot say those two
words without grinning!

361
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,029
I know.

362
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,967
So?

363
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:24,238
I'm just checking
in with you, Livy.

364
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:27,674
Like you do with
all your first-years?

365
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:31,683
You wanted hands-off,
you're getting hands-off.

366
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:34,082
But I can still say
hi to my niece.

367
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:38,386
It looks like you're
settling in pretty well.

368
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:41,316
Wait... No, no, no, the way
you spoke up yesterday?

369
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:44,659
I mean, that's a tough case,
tough crowd, but you held your own.

370
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:48,326
I'm getting there. Dr. Murphy's
been very supportive.

371
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:52,733
Murphy? Yeah, I'm glad to hear
it. I'm sure he sees your potential.

372
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:56,605
- But if you need anything, you...
- Mm...

373
00:22:57,076 --> 00:22:58,100
ask anyone but me.

374
00:22:59,245 --> 00:23:00,508
Very hands-off.

375
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,080
Hmm.

376
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:12,684
Shaun, this is not an argument

377
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:15,523
I ever thought I'd have
to have with a boyfriend,

378
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:17,392
whether moving
in together matters.

379
00:23:17,463 --> 00:23:21,867
It so obviously does. It so
obviously changes everything.

380
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:29,205
But one of the reasons
I'm in this relationship...

381
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,242
is because of that.

382
00:23:33,312 --> 00:23:34,940
You are different.

383
00:23:35,014 --> 00:23:38,280
And when I think about
us, say, a year from now,

384
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:43,414
I can't imagine us not living
together, so if it's inevitable...

385
00:23:46,392 --> 00:23:50,921
Shaun, I am moving in with you.

386
00:23:58,337 --> 00:24:03,969
Does that mean you think we
have enough commitment and trust?

387
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:07,078
Honestly...

388
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:10,950
I'm not sure.

389
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:14,948
So...

390
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:20,089
you want to do it just
because it's inevitable?

391
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:23,120
Mm, that makes
it sound terrible.

392
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:26,791
But that is kind of how I feel,

393
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:29,334
so... yeah.

394
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:37,208
You're moving back in.

395
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:40,469
Oh.

396
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:56,019
My girlfriend is
moving in with me.

397
00:24:57,796 --> 00:25:00,561
We need additional venous
access to start the oxytocin.

398
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:02,396
I'll insert a 16 gauge IV.

399
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:05,897
How do you feel?

400
00:25:06,472 --> 00:25:07,472
Good.

401
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:09,671
Insert a 16 gauge IV.

402
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:13,144
Okay.

403
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:25,084
There's gonna be a pinch.

404
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:31,896
Very good.

405
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,701
Once we start that drip, at
least one baby will be born.

406
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:48,712
I understand.

407
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:51,182
Okay.

408
00:26:06,365 --> 00:26:08,061
Where are you going?

409
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:11,695
Kenzie's only 2 centimeters dilated,
and even though I'm not a surgeon,

410
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,035
- I have other important things to do.
- You were wrong.

411
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:17,406
First-years aren't godsends.
They're a lot of work.

412
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:21,039
- But I fixed Olivia.
- Wonderful. Now fix Jordan.

413
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:24,311
- She's the one you have a problem with.
- No. I don't.

414
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:26,528
Well, technically, she
has a problem with you.

415
00:26:26,552 --> 00:26:29,078
And anyone in authority.
You need to rein her in.

416
00:26:29,655 --> 00:26:31,988
Okay. How do I do that?

417
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:33,286
How'd you fix Olivia?

418
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,903
No new paint, no new parts,
no way you took this to a shop.

419
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:49,430
So there is something up
with you. Something personal.

420
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:52,171
- Something you don't care about.
- That goes without saying.

421
00:26:52,244 --> 00:26:54,475
Except it's messing
with my games.

422
00:26:57,516 --> 00:27:01,419
I just wanna humiliate you without
feeling like I'm punching a kitten.

423
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:08,124
I was finalizing my divorce.

424
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:13,356
- I... thought you were already...
- Not until yesterday.

425
00:27:13,432 --> 00:27:16,197
And we didn't wanna deal with a
formal custody arrangement for Kellan.

426
00:27:16,268 --> 00:27:20,205
But now that he's
18, it's official.

427
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:25,302
I know it's been over for
years, but when it's really over...

428
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,807
it hurts.

429
00:27:30,616 --> 00:27:34,553
And I'm pissed at
myself for being hurt.

430
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,885
And, uh, now I'm
pissed at myself

431
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:40,824
for admitting that to the
coldest person I know.

432
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:51,429
My place has two masters with
en suites, and it's rent-controlled,

433
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:54,439
so it's still probably
cheaper than your motel.

434
00:27:56,542 --> 00:28:00,411
But staying with me will cost
you. Kitty gotta punch back.

435
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:04,176
Thanks. But I'm good.

436
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:16,659
She's at 10 centimeters.

437
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,563
Prepare packed red blood
cells for possible transfusion.

438
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:21,156
Prepare forceps,
clamps and scissors.

439
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:30,375
How do you feel? Really feel?

440
00:28:31,577 --> 00:28:32,772
I feel fine.

441
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,870
Why do you have a
problem with authority?

442
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:38,540
Seriously?

443
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:41,677
I have a problem with you
not acting like an authority.

444
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:44,746
You're not doing the one thing any
junior needs from their supervisor.

445
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:46,052
If I'm screwing up...

446
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:48,423
Not now. Not gonna screw up now.

447
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:51,058
I need to know you're
at least watching.

448
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,555
I need to know you've
got my ass covered.

449
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:06,870
The leak in your bile duct
has caused an infection

450
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:08,971
that could lead to peritonitis.

451
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:12,381
We've got you on multiple
aggressive antibiotics,

452
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:15,819
but this infection
acts very quickly.

453
00:29:17,022 --> 00:29:18,615
Sometimes in a matter of hours.

454
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:22,227
Well, I feel fine.

455
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:23,922
Dopey but fine.

456
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:30,462
Billy, do you understand
what I just told you?

457
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:32,561
I might die tonight.

458
00:29:33,572 --> 00:29:34,572
I get it.

459
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:38,538
How do you do it?

460
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:44,246
I've had worse days.

461
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,784
The day after Linda died...

462
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:57,854
I went to buy a gun.

463
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:03,167
Never used one before.

464
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:05,770
But I figured, how
hard could it be

465
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:08,773
to put it in my mouth
and pull the trigger?

466
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:11,574
On my way to the store...

467
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:18,012
I saw a car parked on the
side of the road with a flat.

468
00:30:19,885 --> 00:30:24,789
Couple of kids who clearly didn't
know what the heck they were doing.

469
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:30,085
And for some reason, I pulled
over and changed their tire.

470
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:33,030
As I was leaving, I told them,

471
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:38,464
"Good timing. Costco's
got a sale on tires."

472
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,639
That's when I
heard Linda's laugh.

473
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,204
"Hey, dummy.

474
00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:54,984
If you kill yourself, who's
gonna change the next tire?"

475
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,985
That's what saved my life.

476
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:04,725
Just wanting to help people.

477
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:10,132
Makes life worthwhile.

478
00:31:25,784 --> 00:31:26,843
Brady.

479
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:37,093
His lungs are also underdeveloped.
He needs to be placed on a ventilator.

480
00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:39,131
Let's get him to the NICU.

481
00:31:40,332 --> 00:31:44,030
Starting magnesium sulfate.
That's to stop your labor.

482
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:48,198
I also need to ligate the umbilical
cord and return it to your uterus.

483
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:54,105
Okay. I have to focus on the
patient, and I have to focus on Jordan,

484
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:56,080
and I also have to focus on you.

485
00:31:56,615 --> 00:31:58,550
I don't know how
to do that. Clamp.

486
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:02,952
Don't worry about me.

487
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:05,957
I appreciate you noticing I
needed help, but I'll be fine.

488
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:07,083
I didn't.

489
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:12,887
- Dr. Andrews?
- Your uncle. Absorbable sutures.

490
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:14,429
He told you?

491
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:18,664
Not that part. I Googled that.
I couldn't trust your résumé.

492
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:29,271
How do you feel?

493
00:32:29,915 --> 00:32:33,579
I feel like my uncle
doesn't think I can hack it.

494
00:32:35,387 --> 00:32:37,219
I feel sick.

495
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:40,848
She's having
another contraction.

496
00:32:40,926 --> 00:32:43,259
Adding terbutaline and
calcium channel blockers.

497
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:47,356
Am I gonna lose Landy?
Am I gonna lose both of them?

498
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:50,769
I don't know.

499
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:06,308
She's still in labor?

500
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:07,852
BP's 95 over 60.

501
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,616
Kenzie, we need
to do a C-section.

502
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:14,649
- No, no. If he comes out, he'll die.
- If he doesn't, you both will.

503
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:16,490
- No.
- Sixty-nine over 40.

504
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,223
We're doing a C-section.

505
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:22,824
- No.
- Let's prep and drape her.

506
00:33:22,901 --> 00:33:27,566
No, I can't. I can't
lose Landy! No!

507
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:31,235
- We need to restrain her.
- Landy's going to be just fine.

508
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:32,834
- Landy is not...
- Shh!

509
00:33:32,911 --> 00:33:36,075
Kenzie, just listen to my
voice, okay? Just focus.

510
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:38,748
What's your favorite board game?

511
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:42,478
No! Okay. Restraints. Please.

512
00:33:43,655 --> 00:33:45,556
Look at me. Don't look at them.

513
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:47,789
Board game.

514
00:33:48,293 --> 00:33:50,421
- Uh... Scrabble.
- Mm-hm.

515
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:52,521
A classic. Nice.

516
00:33:52,998 --> 00:33:53,998
Eight years from now,

517
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:57,434
Landy hits a triple word
score with the word "breathe."

518
00:33:57,502 --> 00:33:59,164
Try it, breathe.

519
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:01,238
Good.

520
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:05,266
What's Brady doing?

521
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:08,179
Uh... he's...

522
00:34:08,747 --> 00:34:11,216
He's mad that his
brother just schooled him.

523
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:14,376
Of course he is.

524
00:34:33,038 --> 00:34:34,734
Hundred over 65.

525
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:36,798
Contractions are stopping.

526
00:34:41,046 --> 00:34:42,742
Words with X and Z.

527
00:34:44,883 --> 00:34:46,476
Only way you're gonna beat them.

528
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:49,584
I better brush up.

529
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,374
A delayed interval twin
delivery? That's awesome.

530
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:11,910
I can't teach.

531
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:15,156
Did you ask the
first-years how they feel?

532
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,614
Yes. Unhappy.

533
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:17,740
Okay. That's great.

534
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,810
Not that they're unhappy,
but that you asked,

535
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:23,822
they confided in you, and
you learned something.

536
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:27,949
I learned that Olivia
needed help, so I helped her,

537
00:35:28,026 --> 00:35:29,892
and now she feels sick
because I helped her.

538
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,829
Morgan says Jordan needs help,
but Jordan says she doesn't need help,

539
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:35,162
but Jordan's mad
because I didn't help her.

540
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:37,030
Okay. That sounds tricky.

541
00:35:37,102 --> 00:35:38,968
That was my point.

542
00:35:39,037 --> 00:35:41,438
You know what?
You'll figure it out.

543
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:43,031
And even if you don't this time,

544
00:35:43,108 --> 00:35:44,940
that's okay, you'll
learn something.

545
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:48,970
And you know what?
You're a wonderful teacher.

546
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:52,974
Been learning from you
since the first day we met.

547
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,029
How's he doing?

548
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:12,302
Well...

549
00:36:12,804 --> 00:36:14,238
either he wakes,

550
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:18,176
or he lapses into a coma
and slowly fades away.

551
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,178
Beautiful day.

Not yet. Been a little busy.

556
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:54,676
Helpers aren't so
good at asking for help.

557
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,249
Kind of glad I did, though.

Despite the bickering.

563
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:19,929
Opposing points
of view are great,

564
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:23,065
as long you actually listen
to the other point of view.

565
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:27,034
You're carrying baggage
that is affecting your decisions.

566
00:37:27,112 --> 00:37:30,105
You saw that because
you're good at reading people.

567
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:31,878
Other people.

568
00:37:32,317 --> 00:37:34,081

It's a list of all the things
you did right on this case.

580
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:23,028
You can hack it.

581
00:38:25,103 --> 00:38:28,437

you did wrong on this case.

582
00:38:29,841 --> 00:38:31,810

00:38:51,596 --> 00:38:52,655

00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,289
<i>Drop dead.</i>

590
00:39:10,315 --> 00:39:12,580
Great to see you've started
your own clothing line.

591
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,744
The official gear of
those who've given up.

592
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:18,518
By en suite, I meant there's
a trash can in your closet.

593
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:37,767
Hey, want a ride?

594
00:39:44,282 --> 00:39:45,750
Murphy told you.

595
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,928
You never knew
your great-aunt Winn.

596
00:39:59,998 --> 00:40:03,196
She moved in with us when...

597
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:06,130
I was 8.

598
00:40:09,274 --> 00:40:12,608
Your grandparents weren't
getting along, lot of fighting.

599
00:40:13,111 --> 00:40:16,946
But whenever it got really bad,

600
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:20,543
Auntie Winn would take your
mom and me into the kitchen,

601
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:22,848
make cupcakes,

602
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:27,791
something out of papier-mâché,
or teach us a card game.

603
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:34,164
I've always wanted to be
that kind of person for you.

604
00:40:38,503 --> 00:40:39,835
You have been.

605
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,772
But now I need to know
you think I can do this.

606
00:40:48,513 --> 00:40:49,947
Accepting your help...

607
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:54,145
makes me feel like garbage.

608
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:58,446
- Livy, I'm sorry...
- I know.

609
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:03,226
I love you too.

610
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,865
But I have to make this work.

611
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:38,754
Feels like home. Again.

612
00:41:39,397 --> 00:41:42,561
It feels like home
again to me too.

613
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:46,495
Maybe you were right.

614
00:41:46,571 --> 00:41:49,837
Maybe things are the same.

615
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,150
No.

616
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:03,488
You were right.
It's not the same.

617
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:06,883
It's better.
