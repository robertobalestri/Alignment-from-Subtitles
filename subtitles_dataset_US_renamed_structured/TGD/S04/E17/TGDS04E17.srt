1
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:06,199
Don't put any food down the
sink. Garbage disposal's broken.

2
00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:07,899
- I'll call the landlord.
- All right.

3
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:11,304
He took a week to call the
plumber when we lost the hot water,

4
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:13,506
but I guess this
doesn't matter as much.

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,982
- We'll just use the regular trash.
- Yes.

6
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:25,348
Ten to 15 percent of known
pregnancies end in miscarriage.

7
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:27,223
This wasn't unusual.

8
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,292
No, you're right, we're not the
only people to go through this.

9
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:36,932
The best thing to do is
to just get back to normal.

10
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:39,705
Hmm.

11
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:42,207
I'm glad you're
going back into work.

12
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:45,040
A couple more days of
rest, and I'll be doing that too.

13
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,450
Are you sure you're all right?

14
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:57,824
"All right" is
stretching it, but yeah.

15
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:00,455
We just need some time.

16
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:49,703
- How you feeling?
- All right.

17
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:56,542
- How's Lea doing?
- She thinks we need time. I agree.

18
00:01:57,551 --> 00:01:59,281
Hey, Shaun. How are you feeling?

19
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,955
All right. And Lea
thinks we need time.

20
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:06,356
Well, I didn't expect to see you
here. You have a few days leave,

21
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,622
- I thought you'd be home.
- I prefer to work.

22
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:15,226
Well, we respect your
judgment. Bon appétit.

23
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,803
Gastric reflux causing
projectile vomiting.

24
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:31,743
I'm clearing your schedule
for the next... how many days?

25
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:36,449
Oh. Well, that is up to my
lovely and talented doctors.

26
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:38,719
Welcome to St.
Bonaventure, Senator Clark.

27
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:42,353
- Please. Marian.
- Oh, Marian. I am a huge supporter.

28
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:44,727
You had my vote in the
presidential primaries.

29
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,164
- Thank you, Dr. Browne.
- Oh, Claire.

30
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:50,500
Claire. If only if there'd been
another couple million like you...

31
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,610
Yeah.

32
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:58,104
It's okay, nothing wrong
with a balanced ticket.

33
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:01,238
I was in my hotel this
morning, going over my speech,

34
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,783
when this started
happening to my face.

35
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:08,516
Whole left side went rogue,
blinking and twitching like crazy.

36
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:09,886
Has it happened before?

37
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,085
This was the third time.
Fortunately, all in private.

38
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,253
Needless to say, I had
to cancel my appearance.

39
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,557
Can I see that again?

40
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,792
Oh, I'm sorry, just deleted it.

41
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,031
The only thing worse than people
seeing my twitchy face in person

42
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:25,368
is them seeing my twitchy
face on a hacked video.

43
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:30,200
So, how do we go about
deleting it from my body?

44
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,736
It's a hemifacial spasm.

45
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:35,715
We should do an MRI to rule out
the more serious possible causes.

46
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,774
- Which are?
- Aneurysm, MS,

47
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,147
possibly a brain tumor.

48
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,387
What are the less
serious causes?

49
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:43,924
Stress, exhaustion,
too much coffee.

50
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,720
Well, that's my job description.

51
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,455
Which can be treated
with Botox injections

52
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,224
- and Ativan.
- Ah. Sold.

53
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:52,897
We still need to do the MRI.

54
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,234
Do both.

55
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:59,270
Oh. As Claire knows, I always
have to control the agenda.

56
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:08,913
Hi. Artie Hill. I have
mild heart failure.

57
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,681
I'm Dr. Park. How do you
know you have mild heart failure?

58
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:15,847
I'm tired and I've been
having palpitations.

59
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:18,585
We'll run tests, but if it
makes you feel better,

60
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:21,924
a lot of people have palpitations, and
it doesn't usually mean heart failure.

61
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:24,260
Yeah, but I was talking
to my doctor on the phone,

62
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:25,993
and he told me I
have heart failure.

63
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,997
- The doctor who did my bypass.
- Your bypass?

64
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:33,170
He told me I should go to
the nearest emergency room.

65
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,299
I was in the park,
looking at the cherry trees,

66
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,469
and I started feeling
funny, so I called...

67
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,808
- When was this bypass?
- A month ago.

68
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:45,149
Paul Nakano. I performed his
surgery at San Jose General.

69
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:49,312
Mr. Hill, I hope you took
a taxi, as I asked you to.

70
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:50,618
It was only three blocks.

71
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:55,127
If you don't mind, I'd
like to get a 12-lead EKG,

72
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:57,130
cardiac CT, and blood work.

73
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:00,394
Ordinarily, I'd be thinking about
volume overload as the cause...

74
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,833
But in this case, sodium
and BUN are normal.

75
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:05,737
The next thing I'd look at is a
post-op myocardial infarction.

76
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:08,035
But in this case the
troponins are normal.

77
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,239
- So you know what I'm thinking?
- Yes. You did your job too damn well.

78
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:16,383
The heart's been so
strengthened from the bypass

79
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,349
that it's revealed a
weakness in the valve.

80
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:19,886
It can't handle the
pump pressure.

81
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:27,388
Dr. Nakano was my chief of
surgery when I was a resident.

82
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:31,726
- So when do you want to open him up?
- I'm hoping never.

83
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:36,130
Have either of you ever done a
transcatheter aortic valve replacement?

84
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:38,001
Well, I've read about it.

85
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,768
It's minimally invasive, and
way preferable to opening up

86
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:42,740
the patient for the
second time in a month.

87
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,142
I look forward to
learning from you again.

88
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:46,212
Hmm.

89
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,148
Oh. Excuse me. Sir.

90
00:05:58,091 --> 00:05:59,150
Person in the hall.

91
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:08,034
- Oh, sorry.
- Hello. I am Dr. Shaun Murphy.

92
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,101
I am a surgeon.

93
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:14,033
I... I can't find my socks. I can't
find the button to call someone.

94
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:22,279
Oh, right. Now, why would they
put it there? You can't even see it.

95
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,611
What about the socks?

96
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,282
I have mild heart failure.

97
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,384
I was in the park, looking
at the cherry trees...

98
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:36,760
Cherry trees aren't in
bloom at this time of year.

99
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,264
I can still look
at them, though.

100
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,596
They don't disappear just
because the blossoms fall.

101
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:44,261
I can get you socks from
the pre-op supplies area.

102
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:47,239
Oh, yes, I remember those crappy
socks they give you. I'll take them.

103
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:51,967
Why do you guys keep it so
cold in here? My feet are freezing.

104
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:00,445
<i>It's beautiful to look at</i>

105
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,360
<i>if you're inside and don't
have to go anywhere.</i>

106
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,617
<i>And you might not want to
go anywhere if you don't...</i>

107
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,124
<i>supposed to take care of ours,</i>

108
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:08,661
<i>but he lost his silly
head and shot Broome.</i>

109
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,357
<i>And that's what was so
funny about it, is that we...</i>

110
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:37,552
We'll use a pigtail catheter
to place the guide wire,

111
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:40,752
then run a delivery catheter
through an 18 French sheath

112
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:44,059
to ferry the new valve through
the femoral artery to the heart.

113
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,825
Then we inflate a balloon
that expands the new valve

114
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:50,302
and installs it right
inside his current one.

115
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,838
That would kill him.

116
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:57,971
He has cold feet.

117
00:07:58,044 --> 00:07:59,171
Who are you?

118
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,780
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

119
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:03,710
He's one of my residents.

120
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:07,515
Oh. Artie has cold feet?
He's afraid of the procedure?

121
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:11,716
No, I think Dr. Murphy means it
literally, the patient has cold feet.

122
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,316
Is his body
temperature dropping?

123
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:16,591
No, his core body
temperature is stable at 98.5.

124
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:19,097
He rarely has cold
feet. I got him socks.

125
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:23,663
You're gonna need to draw
some dotted lines here for me.

126
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:26,999
Okay. Cold feet means
impaired circulation,

127
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,033
which means constricted
blood flow from the heart,

128
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:30,338
which means a damaged vessel.

129
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,811
If we try to push the new
valve through the damaged area,

130
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,438
it will rip open, killing him.

131
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:38,213
- Damaged vessel?
- Yes, you made a mistake during bypass.

132
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:40,014
Most likely a tear in the aorta.

133
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:44,389
- I didn't make a mistake.
- You caused an aortic dissection.

134
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:46,551
Shaun, this man has
more cardiac experience

135
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:49,027
than everyone in
this room, times ten.

136
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:52,554
A lot of people have cold
feet. My wife has cold feet.

137
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:55,124
Everyone has cold
feet in a hospital.

138
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:58,564
Yes. We should perform
an angio on Mr. Hill.

139
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:00,436
That will show the
aortic dissection.

140
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,907
This man recently
underwent open-heart surgery.

141
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,278
He's gonna have
valve replacement.

142
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,041
We don't need to load him
up with yet another procedure

143
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,639
when there was no mistake.

144
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:17,383
Studies show that old people
are less likely to admit mistakes

145
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:19,926
because they are less
aware when they've made one.

146
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,259
Okay, Dr. Murphy. You've told
us your thoughts on this case.

147
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:30,737
It's my understanding that
you have a few days of leave.

148
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:32,238
I suggest you take them.

149
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:33,773
I'd prefer to continue working.

150
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:35,967
Then do it somewhere else.

151
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:47,481
You... will kill him.

152
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,998
- You think my surgeon is wrong?
- Yes.

153
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,801
And you're, like, a
real doctor, right?

154
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:08,704
I am a real doctor.

155
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,706
No offense, but
best heart guy around

156
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:16,271
versus the guy who happened to be
passing my room when I needed socks.

157
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,417
Why shouldn't I let Dr. Nakano
do what he thinks I need?

158
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:21,682
If anything goes
wrong, he can fix it.

159
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:24,815
It could be difficult.

160
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:28,154
The tip of the catheter
would be likely to rupture

161
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:30,993
your weakened aorta, ripping it
open and causing you to hemorrhage

162
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:33,295
into your chest and bleed
out in a matter of minutes.

163
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:38,168
If you survived, you'd have
severe anoxic brain damage.

164
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:41,637
But it's unlikely you'd survive.

165
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:47,210
Go home.

166
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,883
Is Mr. Hill
requesting the angio?

167
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,317
He's not just requesting,
he's demanding.

168
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:56,532
This is why you take a leave
of absence when you need one.

169
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:57,717
You're not thinking clearly,

170
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,986
or you never would have
pulled a stunt like this.

171
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:04,853
I prefer to stay at work. I
could assist with ER consults.

172
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:10,531
Dr. Murphy, because
I'm being professional,

173
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:13,573
you may not understand
how angry I am right now.

174
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,106
Will you do what Mr. Hill wants?

175
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:22,512
What you want, you mean.

176
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:26,275
Yes, we'll do it.
You've forced our hand.

177
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:29,421
Good.

178
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,496
I would have fired him.

179
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,443
Honey, when Freya brings you a
dead rat, she's offering you a gift.

180
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:55,880
<i>I know, I waited until she was gone
so she wouldn't see me toss it away.</i>

181
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,814
<i>Wish you were here, you
could strike the right balance</i>

182
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:00,944
<i>between enthusiasm
and discouragement.</i>

183
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,250
Oh. Honey, I gotta go.
My doctors are here.

184
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:04,757
<i>You sure everything is okay?</i>

185
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:08,386
Absolutely. These shots are
working like a charm. Love you!

186
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,089
<i>Love you. Mwah.</i>

187
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,631
The shots are not doing the
job. What else do you have?

188
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,303
I had another episode. It
was shorter, but still there.

189
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,101
The MRI shows a branch
off the basilar artery

190
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:22,733
that's compressing
the facial nerve.

191
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:25,677
Unfortunately, you
have a tortuous artery.

192
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:28,247
Where it should be
straight, it bends and twists.

193
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:31,341
Bad news is, it'd be a nightmare
to try and address this surgically.

194
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:34,444
- Good news...
- Is, other than some twitching,

195
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:36,420
which is minimized by the Botox,

196
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:39,084
- it's not causing any other problems.
- Exactly.

197
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:43,493
Aside from the complete destruction
of all I want to achieve in life.

198
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:46,629
Melodramatic, yet true.

199
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,633
These episodes keep happening,

200
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:52,297
eventually one of them
will get caught on video.

201
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:54,864
Ten minutes later, it'll
be all over social media.

202
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,704
My opponents will
mock me relentlessly.

203
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:59,074
I think a lot of people
would have sympathy for you.

204
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,637
We don't vote for people
we feel sympathy for.

205
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:06,311
We want strong leaders. We want
the symbol more than the reality.

206
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:10,684
Please, help me.

207
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:15,823
- Unfortunately, there's nothing we can do.
- We'll see what we can come up with.

Shaun?

216
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,291
You shouldn't be here.

217
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,596
Andrews is pissed at
you, with good reason.

218
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:31,931
There's no need to
make him more angry.

219
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,904
That's why I'm hiding.

220
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:36,374
I couldn't wait in the lounge
because the walls are glass

221
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:37,910
and people could see me.

222
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,741
Wait? What are you waiting for?

223
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:42,714
When they see that I was
right, they'll let me come back.

224
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:45,752
I want to be prepared. I'm reading
about options in aortic dissection.

225
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,377
- Shaun, no.
- Yes.

226
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:50,719
Once they do the angio,
they'll see the evidence.

227
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,884
Dr. Andrews won't
be angry anymore.

228
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,393
They did the angio.

229
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,460
Mm.

230
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:57,396
Oh.

231
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,833
No. No, they... They couldn't.

232
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:04,062
They did it. I was
there. You were wrong.

233
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:06,171
But...

234
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,402
- Cold feet...
- It was a focused angio.

235
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:12,809
I saw the ascending
aorta and the aortic root.

236
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,608
There was no sign of dissection.

237
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,976
They're giving the patient a chance
to rest before scheduling the TAVR.

238
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:23,823
We all make mistakes.

239
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:29,827
I think you should leave the
building while you're still forgivable.

- Yeah.

250
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:49,205
- How are you?
- I'm good.

251
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:53,674
It happened to me too.

252
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:57,749
Twice.

253
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:09,226
We could bypass
the basilar artery.

254
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,593
A 25-percent
mortality rate? Sure.

255
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,334
How about stereotactic
radiosurgery?

256
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:17,631
Oh, she wouldn't like it.

257
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:20,138
It takes months to see
any kind of improvement.

258
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,902
It's interesting. The fact
that you like this person

259
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:25,638
makes you willing to make
stupid decisions that could kill her.

260
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:31,644
We could meet in the middle.

261
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:35,480
Tortuous or not, the main
basilar isn't causing the spasms.

262
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:38,217
So we leave it alone and just
sling up the branch of the artery

263
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,554
that's applying the pressure.

264
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,760
Nice.

265
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:45,629
I have two predictions to make.

266
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,735
One, she'll come up with
a rationalization to justify

267
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:52,067
not telling her husband
about this surgery.

268
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:54,266
And two, you'll come
up with a rationalization

269
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,501
to justify forgiving
her for that.

270
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:02,242
You wouldn't have fired him.

271
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:07,487
He's dealing with
some personal issues.

272
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:12,287
And I remember you giving me
some slack once when I screwed up.

273
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:14,792
Well, you were facing
a challenging surgery.

274
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:18,126
And your girlfriend, who I never
liked, by the way, dumped you, so...

275
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:19,277
You knew about the dumping?

276
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:21,528
Oh, yeah. I just
didn't know why.

277
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,405
She wanted a commitment,
said I didn't love her enough.

278
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,666
And I told her I loved her, but
I didn't have time to get into it

279
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,505
because I had an
esophagus to reconstruct.

280
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:37,678
Why did you help me? I
mean, why me, and not Penzer?

281
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:41,819
He was always number one in
our class, I was always second.

282
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:43,048
Where's Penzer now?

283
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:46,023
You think I've been following the
guy's career for the past 20 years?

284
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,727
He's at the NIH, making policy.

285
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:54,665
That's Penzer. Great
mind, great hands.

286
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:57,498
But I knew he'd
never be a surgeon.

287
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,035
He didn't love it enough.

288
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,056
- I can wait.
- Oh, this can too.

289
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,658
I'm just letting the
phone get to 10 percent,

290
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:31,067
then I'll run the gauntlet of
well-wishers and head out.

291
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:34,033
Yeah, I'm one of them.

292
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:52,048
When my grandma died,
I remember a whole relay

293
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:54,719
of the mothers of the church
bringing food to the house.

294
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,221
They all loved my grandma.

295
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:04,563
The older ladies got their best
hats and gloves out for the service.

296
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:11,506
Pastor made a special
prayer at the gravesite.

297
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,908
We all told stories about her.

298
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:17,048
There were rituals.

299
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,381
We said goodbye to the past.

300
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:31,460
You're saying
goodbye to the future.

301
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,462
I'm sorry for your loss.

302
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,423
And how soon could
I get out of here?

303
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:09,799
If all goes well, a day,
maybe two at most.

304
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:12,429
- Ugh. You hear that, Cal?
- Rebooking for Thursday.

305
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:15,631
- There was an "if" there.
- That's strange, I heard a "when."

306
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:18,607
Now, I will be appointing Cal

307
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:20,509
as my healthcare
surrogate while I'm under.

308
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,280
Most people
appoint their spouse.

309
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,841
Or at least notify them.

310
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,648
He'll just try to talk me out
of this because he loves me,

311
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,981
whereas Cal is using
me to find a better position

312
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:33,684
but knows exactly what I want.

313
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:38,964
So let's fix my broken brain.

314
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:54,841
I got your text.

315
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:01,985
I'm a good diagnostician.

316
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:05,520
Of course you are. Sit
down. You... You want to sit?

317
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:07,192
No.

318
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:12,189
I accounted for every symptom.
I listened to the patient's history.

319
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,062
Someone's feet were cold.

320
00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:16,058
Okay? I just...

321
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,364
Sometimes that means
something, sometimes it doesn't.

322
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:20,531
This time it didn't.
So... So what?

323
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:23,700
What are you still
doing here, Shaun?

324
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:25,369
Do you not want to go home?

325
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:30,508
You gotta go home. You
suffered a loss. You gotta...

326
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,677
You gotta deal with
it. You gotta face it.

327
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:34,519
Hmm.

328
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:39,887
Why do I have to face it? What
does that mean? It happened.

329
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,222
Yeah, well...

330
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,755
It did happen.

331
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:48,232
It happened. Okay?

332
00:22:49,268 --> 00:22:50,268
Go home...

333
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,094
and be with Lea.

334
00:23:09,255 --> 00:23:11,588
Oh, Claire, I'm
happy to see you.

335
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,716
It seems the reporters
have discovered I'm here,

336
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:17,251
so poor Cal has gone off to
craft a believable explanation.

337
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:19,924
So, what's something a
person might be hospitalized for

338
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:22,628
that says, "I am an
unstoppable force"?

339
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:25,603
You want me to provide
you with a good lie?

340
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:26,704
Yeah.

341
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,906
But you must be scared.

342
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:39,980
I'm terrified.

343
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,652
You know, when I'm scared...

344
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:49,256
I think about Evvie Sinclair.

345
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:56,129
You were the commencement
speaker at my high school graduation.

346
00:23:57,036 --> 00:23:57,867
Ah...

347
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,929
I was a bit of a mess
back then. I had no idea

348
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:03,134
what I was gonna do with my
life, or what I could do with my life.

349
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:07,639
And you told us
about Evvie Sinclair,

350
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:09,846
born with Turner Syndrome,

351
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:15,610
small in stature, facial
abnormalities, speech impairment.

352
00:24:16,689 --> 00:24:22,151
But she just had... a
desperate need to learn.

353
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:25,761
And against her
parents' wishes...

354
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:28,458
she started high school.

355
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:30,668
And...

356
00:24:31,704 --> 00:24:33,468
And I just remember thinking:

357
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:39,768
"If Evvie can go through those
doors and walk down those halls..."

358
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:44,982
I went home that day and
I applied to 11 colleges.

359
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,846
So I am a doctor...

360
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:54,521
because of you. And Evvie.

361
00:24:55,728 --> 00:24:56,728
Mm.

362
00:24:57,196 --> 00:24:59,165
That was a great story.

363
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:03,729
Rickie Demarest, he was my
campaign manager before Cal.

364
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:07,170
He made up some lovely stuff.

365
00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:23,681
You're back early.

366
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:29,321
Dr. Andrews sent me home, and
Dr. Glassman thinks we should talk.

367
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:57,084
Dr. Glassman is not a
counselor. He's a neurosurgeon.

368
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,752
And a sometimes annoying
person. I'm gonna make some tea.

369
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,601
- Oh. It's your mother. Hello?
- No, no, no, no, no.

370
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,502
<i>Hi, Shaun, how are you?</i>

371
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:15,369
- I'm... well.
- I'm not here.

372
00:26:16,275 --> 00:26:19,507
Lea can't talk to you now.

373
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:22,740
<i>Oh, you're both home. I
wanted to ask about strollers.</i>

374
00:26:22,815 --> 00:26:24,750
<i>The one Lea likes,
I read a review</i>

375
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:27,252
<i>that said the front
wheel keeps coming off.</i>

376
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:29,618
<i>I'm sure she won't listen,
so I'm gonna send a link.</i>

377
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:31,122
<i>You should read it too.</i>

378
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:34,151
Yes. Thank you.

379
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:37,390
<i>You don't want your little girl
pitching headfirst onto the sidewalk.</i>

380
00:26:37,463 --> 00:26:40,194
Oh, no, no, we wouldn't.

381
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:41,494
Just hang up. Just...

382
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,967
Okay. I should go.

383
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:46,164
<i>And now that we know
it's a girl, I was wondering.</i>

384
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:49,673
<i>I already bought a onesie with little
dinosaurs on it, unbelievably cute.</i>

385
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:54,509
Mm. Cute. Yes. Okay. That
sounds good. I am due at the hospital.

386
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,548
<i>Just a quick question.
Since it's not a boy,</i>

387
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:58,139
<i>the dinosaurs will have to go.</i>

388
00:26:58,217 --> 00:26:59,817
- And...
<i>- What would be nice for a girl?</i>

389
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:01,284
I don't... I don't know.

390
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:02,685
<i>There's one with ballet shoes.</i>

391
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,780
That's stupid. Why would
you have to change it?

392
00:27:04,857 --> 00:27:06,951
A girl would like dinosaurs
just as much as a boy,

393
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:09,494
dinosaurs are fascinating.
You need to shut up!

394
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,130
<i>Um...</i>

395
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,327
<i>Shaun?</i>

396
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:29,839
As you all know, Senator Clark
is a very competitive person.

397
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:33,510
<i>She tore her meniscus while
charging the net to return a drop shot.</i>

398
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:36,987
<i>For the record, it was
match point, which she won...</i>

399
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:39,957
I wonder if he negotiates
employment contracts.

400
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:42,517
<i>And thanks to the terrific
doctors here at St. Bonaventure,</i>

401
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:44,756
<i>she will be back fighting
for you before you know it.</i>

402
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:46,889
<i>Senator Clark wanted
to thank all of you...</i>

403
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:49,025
- Did you hear that? We're terrific.
- You must be.

404
00:27:49,101 --> 00:27:51,002
You repaired her
meniscus through her head.

405
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:53,470
It's no one's business
why she's here.

406
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:55,770
And there's the rationalization
I've been waiting for.

407
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:58,708
If this was someone you
didn't like, these character flaws

408
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:01,576
would reveal some deep problem,
worthy of your eternal judgment.

409
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,224
- But since...
- You're head of department.

410
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:05,046
I'm sure you've had to
spin things sometimes.

411
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:09,117
Spin things, sure. Lie? No.

412
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:11,486
<i>One more example of how
Senator Clark has been able...</i>

413
00:28:11,557 --> 00:28:14,391
- And that was an example of both.
<i>- Reach across the aisle.</i>

414
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:17,755
Marian isn't waking up.

415
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:23,393
<i>And to that end, she's already
making calls and sending e-mails.</i>

416
00:28:23,502 --> 00:28:27,098
<i>Oh, and texts. She just
told me to wrap it up.</i>

417
00:28:36,782 --> 00:28:38,216
I yelled at your mother.

418
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:40,151
Yeah.

419
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:46,958
I misdiagnosed a patient.
That's why they sent me home.

420
00:28:49,328 --> 00:28:50,819
I'm not behaving normally.

421
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:57,230
Neither am I. But maybe this
is normal for where we're at.

422
00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:05,136
Dr. Glassman talked
about facing my loss,

423
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:08,772
but I don't know what that
means, and even if we could face it,

424
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:12,276
won't we just hurt
ourselves for no reason?

425
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:16,948
I don't know. I don't think
grief has an actual solution.

426
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:19,456
It has to. I can't
stay this way.

427
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:28,332
Claire told me about
this support group.

428
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:34,164
I'm not sure we can just
force ourselves past this.

429
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:43,706
The cold feet are
not a coincidence.

430
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:49,648
If they do the TAVR
procedure, they'll kill the patient.

431
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:52,119
For a different reason.

432
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:08,738
The guide wire's in place. I'm
preparing to deliver the valve.

433
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:13,167
Okay. You... You have to
stop. If that valve goes through...

434
00:30:13,245 --> 00:30:14,110
Get out of here.

435
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:16,512
No. If that valve
goes through, he'll die.

436
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:19,193
- Call security.
- I thought it was aortic dissection,

437
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:20,048
but I was wrong.

438
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:23,350
The cold feet are from a
coarctation... No. No! No!

439
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:28,019
No! It's too close. You're too
close! Stop! Stop! Stop, please! Stop!

440
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:31,426
BP's spiking. Two hundred over
100. Heart rate's up. He's gonna stroke.

441
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:32,725
Give him nitro and Cardene!

442
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,199
I'm pulling out.

443
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:40,232
BP's dropping.

444
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:42,772
He's starting to stabilize.

445
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:48,638
Okay.

446
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,150
Dr. Murphy?

447
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:55,252
Go on.

448
00:30:57,889 --> 00:31:02,156
Dr. Nakano did not make a mistake
in the bypass, he did everything right.

449
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:06,961
But Mr. Hill has a congenital
narrowing of the abdominal aorta.

450
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,725
He's had that coarctation
for years, but never knew

451
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,879
because his body compensated
for the poor circulation

452
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:14,582
by raising his blood pressure,
which caused his heart to deteriorate,

453
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:16,486
requiring a bypass. The
stronger, repaired heart

454
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,786
put pressure on the valve,
and his blood pressure dropped.

455
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:22,212
No more compensation,
his feet got cold.

456
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:26,115
And I could get the guide wire up
there, but the valve delivery system

457
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:28,813
would be too big to fit
through the coarctation

458
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,617
- without damaging the vessel.
- Yes.

459
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:34,085
We'll have to open him up.

460
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:39,925
And the valve will have to be
replaced directly, through surgery.

461
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,428
I hope you'll join us for that.

462
00:31:53,712 --> 00:31:55,442
How's Cal gonna spin this?

463
00:31:55,514 --> 00:31:57,449
Her latest tennis match
went into extra sets?

464
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:06,018
Slinged branch looks good, no
conflict with the seventh nerve,

465
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,023
no bleeds, no strokes.

466
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:12,297
The basilar's dilated.

467
00:32:12,364 --> 00:32:14,299
And compressing her brain stem.

468
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,268
- She stopped breathing.
- We need to intubate. Get the airway cart.

469
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,108
Tell them she's gonna
be at the conference.

470
00:32:30,182 --> 00:32:32,481
And if they keep asking,
tell them the senator believes

471
00:32:32,551 --> 00:32:34,816
anyone not ready to commit
on climate change action

472
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:36,286
is on the wrong side of history.

473
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:38,721
Just never use that phrase
more than once a month.

474
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,452
He has to run.

475
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:43,754
The sling procedure went
fine, but the basilar artery

476
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:46,560
was less stable than we'd
hoped. It's gotten even more dilated

477
00:32:46,665 --> 00:32:49,157
and is causing progressive
neurological deficits.

478
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:51,668
We have no choice
but to bypass the artery.

479
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:54,672
The last surgery was
dangerous. This one way more so.

480
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:59,811
- What do you need me to sign?
- We should inform her husband.

481
00:32:59,878 --> 00:33:01,904
There is a one in four
chance that she could die.

482
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:09,210
If I told Pete that, he'd be
at the airport in half an hour,

483
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:11,552
and everyone would know
that Marian is in this hospital

484
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:12,784
for something this serious.

485
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:15,054
She has a brain aneurysm.
That doesn't make her weak.

486
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,924
Even worse, it makes her mortal.

487
00:33:17,896 --> 00:33:19,728
Her husband has
a right to be here.

488
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:23,393
A moral right. To destroy her career.
Which is what I'm protecting her from.

489
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:27,568
- This is just a game to you, isn't it?
- Yeah.

490
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:30,032
The game they make you play
before you can do anything real.

491
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:45,716
Valve placed, leaflets mobile.

492
00:33:46,825 --> 00:33:49,954
The new valve is perfectly
seated in the annulus.

493
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:52,758
No regurgitation, flow
in both coronary arteries.

494
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:57,398
- I'm about to close up.
- Looks like we've got a paravalvular leak.

495
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:01,900
- We need to go back and fix this.
- Irrigate and check the image.

496
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:16,049
No leak. Slight excess from the
washing jets in the mechanical valve.

497
00:34:16,121 --> 00:34:17,121
Normal finding.

498
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:22,492
- Wow. You're very good.
- I think he knows that.

499
00:34:23,295 --> 00:34:24,295
Still nice to hear.

500
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,928
Closing up now,
2-0 Vicryl suture.

501
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:52,655
Retracting temporal lobe
and cerebellum, very carefully.

502
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:56,319
Vascular anatomy is fully
exposed, avoiding the tortuous area.

503
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:59,762
Radial artery graft length
looks to be a perfect fit.

504
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:05,594
Anastomosing with 9-0 Prolene.

505
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,199
Temporal lobe's swelling.

506
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:12,787
BP and heart rate
are plummeting.

507
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:15,110
Drop her CO2, full
Propofol burst suppression.

508
00:35:16,014 --> 00:35:18,779
- Widen the craniotomy.
- With the cerebellum herniating outward?

509
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:21,149
We do that, she may
never walk normally again.

510
00:35:22,654 --> 00:35:24,919
- If she didn't want a twitch...
- Drill.

511
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:33,463
Open the arachnoid plane
and release C.S.F. collections.

512
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:37,499
Reduce the pressure from the
inside. For her, it's worth the risk.

513
00:35:41,673 --> 00:35:42,936
Arachnoid dissector.

514
00:35:51,683 --> 00:35:54,448
There was a patient admitted
this morning I think you should see.

515
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:57,318
Are you thinking of Mrs. Cavanaugh?
That's a good idea, Dr. Park.

516
00:35:58,056 --> 00:36:01,993
We'd welcome another take as
to whether she's a good candidate

517
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,528
for inserting an ICD.

518
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:07,326
I'll consult just on that
question, if you'd like me to.

519
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:12,662
But I won't join in the
OR. I'm quitting surgery.

520
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,834
I don't understand.
When did you decide...

521
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:20,471
Fifteen minutes ago.

522
00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:27,046
I nearly closed up without
doing a final antibiotic lavage.

523
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:31,945
But you didn't. Nurse Barker
prompted you with the syringe.

524
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:37,121
It was a tiny error. There was
no contamination of the field.

525
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:40,255
Many surgeons don't
even do a final lavage.

526
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:43,392
I always told myself once I
started making tiny errors,

527
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:45,265
I'd stop before I
made a big one.

528
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:49,569
Paul, we almost lost a patient
today. You were still rattled.

529
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:52,371
Thank you, Marcus.

530
00:36:53,912 --> 00:36:55,505
But I made this plan years ago.

531
00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:59,746
Because I knew that when the
time came, I'd look for reasons

532
00:36:59,818 --> 00:37:04,916
why whatever I did wrong
was tiny, minor, didn't count.

533
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:10,293
That's when I made the
rule. Everything counts.

534
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:15,833
Dr. Murphy,

535
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:18,227
it was nice sewing with you.

536
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:59,073
You gave us a scare.
But it's all good now.

537
00:38:01,813 --> 00:38:03,179
You're mad at me.

538
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:05,683
About Little Evvie.

539
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:09,844
No. Evvie inspired me.

540
00:38:11,156 --> 00:38:13,785
I took strength
from her for years.

541
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,689
Now it's all fiction.

542
00:38:19,097 --> 00:38:22,693
Fictional lives
can save real lives.

543
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:27,302
Four years ago, I used that
story on the Senate floor.

544
00:38:27,372 --> 00:38:29,705
I got my bill
passed by one vote.

545
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:34,611
That lie helped millions
of people with disabilities.

546
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:38,415
I'm really proud of that lie.

547
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:56,391
I'm heading out to have
a drink with Dr. Nakano.

548
00:38:57,535 --> 00:39:00,733
Are you going to try to talk
him out of leaving surgery?

549
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:06,004
No. I'm going because no one's
meant to shoulder loss alone.

550
00:39:06,878 --> 00:39:08,870
And I'm the one who
should be with him tonight.

551
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:10,714
Why?

552
00:39:12,417 --> 00:39:14,010
Because we love the same thing.

553
00:39:14,886 --> 00:39:17,856
And he knows no one would understand
what he's lost more than I would.

554
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:46,877
I have been thinking. About all the
people you've helped, including me.

555
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:54,119
And about not sharing the danger
you were in with your husband.

556
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:57,962
Probably not sharing
a lot of other things.

557
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:01,430
And it struck me that...

558
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:05,565
being in a marriage
like that must be lonely.

559
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,903
You can't trust him to lie.

560
00:40:13,311 --> 00:40:17,271
So you end up sharing more
of yourself with a guy like Cal,

561
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:19,317
who is a hired gun
and who's gonna end up

562
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,716
working for somebody
else two years from now.

563
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,120
The fact that Pete
and I don't talk shop

564
00:40:28,226 --> 00:40:30,457
doesn't make our marriage
less than wonderful.

565
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:37,863
Another lie.

566
00:40:50,048 --> 00:40:53,610
Hey, hey! How about
those Devils? Huh?

567
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:57,446
All right, before I go all
fangirl about last night's game,

568
00:40:57,522 --> 00:41:00,492
let's talk about the upcoming
climate change conference.

569
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:04,194
I have to tell you guys
a story, about a little boy

570
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,821
who lives on the outer
banks of South Carolina,

571
00:41:06,898 --> 00:41:08,833
whose home is about
to be washed away...

572
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:16,336
<i>♪ I think if I fail again ♪</i>

573
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:21,407
<i>♪ That I know
you're still listening ♪</i>

574
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:26,473
<i>♪ Maybe it's all Gonna
turn out all right... ♪</i>

575
00:41:26,551 --> 00:41:31,353
I could get another mug, or I could
wash these. It's a tough decision.

576
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:37,387
Mm. And I should probably tell
you, I didn't get to calling the landlord.

577
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:41,530
And maybe ten minutes ago,

578
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,864
I saw a couple fruit
flies near the drain, so...

579
00:41:43,935 --> 00:41:48,532
<i>♪ I have to
believe that it is... ♪</i>

580
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,103
So yeah.

581
00:41:56,314 --> 00:41:58,306
Now it is my fault for...

582
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,613
If we get bugs.

583
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:08,921
<i>♪ And when I
tell you that it is ♪</i>

584
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:13,465
<i>♪ Oh, it's more for my benefit ♪</i>

585
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:18,867
<i>♪ Maybe it's all Gonna
turn out all right ♪</i>

586
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:22,100
<i>♪ Oh, I know that it's not ♪</i>

587
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:27,372
<i>♪ But I have to
believe that it is ♪</i>
