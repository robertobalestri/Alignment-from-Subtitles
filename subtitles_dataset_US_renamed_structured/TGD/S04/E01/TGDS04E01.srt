1
00:00:16,917 --> 00:00:21,048
- All right, that'll be $3.40.
- Oh, okay. Let me just...

2
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,562
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

3
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:37,404
And here you go.

4
00:00:41,842 --> 00:00:43,435
And there you go.

5
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,240
- Thank you.
- No worries.

6
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:47,611
Thank you very much.

7
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:59,950
- Have you seen my ID badge?
- No.

8
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,619
I had it last night.

9
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:05,096
But maybe it fell out of my
bag when I paid for the pizza.

10
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:07,963
This wouldn't happen
if you stayed over.

11
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,094
If you'll remember back
to when I lived here,

12
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:13,196
my ability to lose things
has always been top-notch.

13
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:16,573
If you stayed over, you wouldn't
have had to come all the way back here

14
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:18,612
- when you realized...
- It's too soon, Shaun.

15
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:20,079
Why?

16
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:24,376
If I stayed over, we both
would've gotten a lot less sleep.

17
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:26,215
Why is it too soon?

18
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:28,585
We've only been
together a few weeks.

19
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:33,218
How many weeks of being together
are required before you can stay over?

20
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:34,556
Yes!

21
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:42,366
Saturday. I will spend
the night Saturday.

22
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:54,110
I'm glad we come here.

23
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,141
I don't want to stop coming.

24
00:01:58,085 --> 00:02:00,919
- Why would we?
- I don't know, that's the way it works.

25
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:04,617
You mourn, you cry,
and then you forget.

26
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:11,296
You don't forget. You...

27
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:14,526
start to move on.

28
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,134
I don't want to stop coming.

29
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:34,918
Your temperature is almost
101. Your other symptoms?

30
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:39,119
First, it was a sore throat,
then my body started aching.

31
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,624
And then there's this
cough. I even had my flu shot.

32
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:47,497
Unfortunately, influenza
is constantly mutating,

33
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,229
the shot always lags behind.

34
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:51,999
Hopefully, you'll recover
faster because of it.

35
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,800
My daughter's very worried that I
might have this virus from China?

36
00:02:57,878 --> 00:02:58,878
What's it called?

37
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:02,347
Have you been to China or been around
anyone who's been to China recently?

38
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:04,749
Taken any cruises?

39
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:08,014
The coronavirus doesn't
cause sore throats.

40
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:09,386
This is a bad case of the flu.

41
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:13,757
Go home, rest, drink plenty of
fluids. You'll be fine in a week or two.

42
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,702
The virus damaged
your mother's lungs.

43
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,832
Her body is working
harder to breathe,

44
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:30,173
but her blood oxygen
levels continue to drop.

45
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,735
She definitely has Corona?

46
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:37,842
We're doing everything
we can to help her.

47
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,737
You have COVID-19.

48
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,438
But you haven't tested me.

49
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:08,413
Your chest X-ray suggests
ground-glass opacities.

50
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:12,249
That's COVID. I don't need a test.
Which is good because we don't have any.

51
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,412
But I can't smell.

52
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:16,150
I've read about it.
That's not a symptom.

53
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:20,125
I guess it is now.
You have COVID.

54
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:25,163
Okay. Now what?

55
00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:27,565
Now, you go home.

56
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:29,296
- That's it?
- That's it.

57
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,235
There's no treatment,
stay away from people.

58
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:33,466
Come back if you have
trouble breathing. Goodbye.

59
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,674
Twenty-five tests? Per day?

60
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,038
No, just give me
one of tomorrow's.

61
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:44,610
Hello? County Health Department.
I don't have time for them,

62
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,312
and they don't have time for me.

63
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:47,682
Patient.

64
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:50,121
- Needs a lumpectomy?
- Yes. Needs. And yet.

65
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,159
- Surgery canceled?
- They ruled it elective.

66
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:54,524
- It is.
- You just said "needs."

67
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:57,291
I didn't say when. This can
wait till after the pandemic.

68
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:03,099
Yeah, I'm twice the size of SJ General.
I should have twice the amount of tests.

69
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,934
Well, who do I speak to?

70
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:07,236
Do you feel shortness of breath?

71
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,502
A little.

72
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:12,779
If I'm sick, is my baby sick?

73
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:15,372
This disease doesn't really
seem to affect children or babies

74
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:18,213
like it does adults.
Should we admit her?

75
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:20,481
She's probably safer at home.

76
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,958
What's at home? Do you
have a support system?

77
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:27,893
Can anyone come help
you, in case you get worse?

78
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:31,192
It's just me and the little one.

79
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:37,698
Get her a room. Start her
on oxygen via nasal cannula,

80
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:40,330
and let's try some
vancomycin and cefepime.

81
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:44,703
Hey, Mia. No, I'm not headed
back there today. Or this week.

82
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:46,143
I found a temporary place here.

83
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:47,909
<i>There are hospitals
in Phoenix too.</i>

84
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,983
If I come home, do you
want me living with you?

85
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,541
<i>That's the point.</i>

86
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,643
Every night after 12
hours of COVID patients,

87
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,622
to hang out with you. And
Kellan. And his asthma.

88
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:01,821
<i>He's gonna be really
bummed. His graduation...</i>

89
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:04,831
Isn't till June, this'll be
over long before then.

90
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:07,527
<i>Someone must have connections.</i>

91
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:11,662
<i>At county? Van Kleek does, Woo
does, Nguyen's husband works at...</i>

92
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:12,865
<i>Get one of them to call.</i>

93
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,170
<i>The board of every
hospital has connections.</i>

94
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:17,370
<i>They're calling Public
Health and getting nowhere.</i>

95
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:20,346
<i>- So we do nothing?
- No. We do everything we can.</i>

96
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:22,575
<i>We hammer at official channels</i>

97
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:25,049
<i>and every manufacturer's
rep that we deal with</i>

98
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,781
<i>and see what companies,
if any, have undisturbed...</i>

99
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,254
<i>Nuts or no nuts?</i>

100
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:31,423
<i>Uh...</i>

101
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:37,455
<i>I'm sorry, I'm in the middle
of a meeting with the board.</i>

102
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:41,695
<i>Hey, everyone. I'm just
making banana bread.</i>

103
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:44,397
Let's just take a...
I'll take a quick break.

104
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:49,034
If someone can get me a list of
PPE suppliers in the area, thanks.

105
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:50,236
I'll be back.

106
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,441
I don't want banana bread. I
want to be back at the hospital.

107
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:55,778
I'm the president and
I'm at home, watching.

108
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:57,044
You're doing your job.

109
00:06:57,117 --> 00:07:00,110
And whatever you gotta do,
whatever decisions you need to make,

110
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:01,313
you just do it right here.

111
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:06,793
I can take the necessary precautions,
that whole meeting was about PPEs,

112
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,591
- mitigation...
- Aaron, you are 65 years old

113
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:14,067
with a history of cancer.
You get that virus, then what?

114
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,099
I don't know what I'm doing.

115
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:22,302
You're being smart, you're being
safe. What is wrong with that?

116
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:26,642
And what is wrong with being
home together for a while?

117
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,278
Nothing, I guess.

118
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:35,083
We have no
choice. Let's enjoy it.

119
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:38,848
Nuts or no nuts?

120
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,623
- Nuts.
- Okay.

121
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:47,797
What's going on?

122
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,836
Your mother's oxygen
got critically low,

123
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:52,668
- we need to get her on a ventilator.
- That'll help her get better?

124
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:56,198
It'll keep her alive, hopefully long
enough for her to fight off the virus.

125
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:58,677
- Is it dangerous?
- More for us.

126
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,877
She's out.

127
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:11,985
Lots of swelling.

128
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,464
Slow. You want this over
with as soon as possible.

129
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:26,768
But you also don't
want her to cough.

130
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:56,859
Hello.

131
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:59,235
<i>Sorry. I woke you. Thought
you had to be up now.</i>

132
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:01,865
- I do. I pushed snooze twice.
<i>- I read the numbers.</i>

133
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:04,433
<i>You guys had seven deaths in
Santa Clara County yesterday.</i>

134
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,672
<i>Any at St. Bonaventure?</i>

135
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,214
We have deaths at St.
Bonaventure every day, Kellan.

136
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:11,580
- <i>I miss you.</i>
- I know. You already said that.

137
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,085
<i>I wanted to reinforce the point.</i>

138
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:16,885
You said you missed me a
lot. And we're together right now.

139
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:19,221
<i>It's different not
being actually together.</i>

140
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,454
You mean not being
able to have sex?

141
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:25,522
Haven't been tested
because there's no need.

142
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:26,930
I'm fine. No symptoms.

143
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,866
<i>You can be asymptomatic
and still have it.</i>

144
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:31,097
I know. You still working out?

145
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:33,333
Don't want to lose arm
strength while you're off.

146
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,601
<i>I'm making a salad.</i>

147
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:37,473
<i>Figured I'd bring it by and we'll
have a masked, distanced dinner.</i>

148
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:39,479
You can't eat with a mask on.

149
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:42,209
<i>We'll take them off when
we're eating, and turn our heads.</i>

150
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:45,810
- Regular masks don't work.
<i>- Bring me one from work.</i>

151
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:46,784
No.

152
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:48,412
<i>Do you have enough PPE?</i>

153
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:51,924
- PPE?
<i>- Personal protective equipment, Dad.</i>

154
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:56,156
Someone's been doing their research.
We have enough. I'm being careful.

155
00:09:56,563 --> 00:10:00,091
- I heard your mother joined a book club.
<i>- Is Shaun being careful?</i>

156
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,158
Oh, yes, I am. Very.

157
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:05,000
<i>So am I. It should be
safe for me to come over.</i>

158
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,870
You can't come over
because we are being safe.

159
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,672
<i>What about apples? Do you have
enough apples? I could go shop...</i>

160
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:11,972
He does.

161
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:15,675
- Everything is under control.
- Everything is under control.

162
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:25,925
I told you not to come back
unless your breathing got worse.

163
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:28,792
<i>Between the fever and the
cough, he's barely sleeping.</i>

164
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,630
Who said that?

165
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:36,197
My wife wanted to come
with me, but she has to work.

166
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:37,862
She's essential personnel.

167
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:40,404
<i>He's lost ten pounds.</i>

168
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:42,774
Breathe.

169
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:44,667
<i>He should have
come in a week ago.</i>

170
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:47,213
Please don't talk
when I'm listening.

171
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:50,343
Breathe.

172
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,944
<i>He's also coughing. A lot.
He hasn't told you, but he is.</i>

173
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,617
- I'm sorry.
<i>- Did you just apologize for me?</i>

174
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,454
<i>Because I'm worried?</i>

175
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,489
<i>So sorry. I'm a wife who is
worried about her husband.</i>

176
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:07,466
<i>- Forgive me, I'm evil.</i>
- It's lucky that you're so irritating.

177
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:09,967
<i>What?</i>

178
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:13,632
Your husband's blood
oxygen level is dangerously low.

179
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,670
That can't be.

180
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:20,373
I mean, I don't feel that bad.
Not great, but my breathing...

181
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:24,747
That's interesting. You don't
feel bad, but you are. Hm.

182
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,251
Admit him to the COVID floor,

183
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:29,915
start heated humidified
high-flow nasal cannula at 8 LPM.

184
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:54,708
Her CRP, ESR, ferritin, D-dimer,

185
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:57,478
transaminases, and
IL-6 are all way up.

186
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,542
Try her on dexamethasone.

187
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:01,212
I read in my online
physicians' group

188
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,552
that the UK's had
some success with that.

189
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:07,759
Thank you.

190
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:10,696
Sorry. What did you say?
Couldn't hear with the mask.

191
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:14,427
Thank you. I heard you
stepped in for a therapist

192
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,934
that didn't come in today.

193
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:18,870
My son has asthma. I've been
doing this kind of stuff for years.

194
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:26,477
I got a dresser and a crib,
bolted them both to the wall.

195
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:32,642
All that matters is her. I'm
going to do everything right.

196
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:37,448
You're going to be a parent. No
way you're doing everything right.

197
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:47,298
Even trade, 200 surplus
vials for your COVID test kits.

198
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,268
What do you need?

199
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:53,534
I've got hydroxychloroquine,
ribavirin... EKG leads?

200
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,303
No, no, I'm not saying no.
We'll pick them up in two hours.

201
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:58,277
We have a surplus of EKG leads?

202
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:01,075
No. We've got a shortage. But
that's a problem that can wait.

203
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:04,140
Mildred's P-to-F is below 50, she's
showing signs of cardiogenic shock.

204
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:05,913
- Start her on steroids.
- Already have.

205
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,920
If she goes downhill,
I'd like to add ECMO,

206
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:10,616
- take the strain off her heart and lungs.
- Good idea.

207
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,284
I need EKG leads,
what do you need?

208
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:19,457
- Should we intubate him?
- Not yet. Not a minute before we need to.

209
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,933
His oxygen saturation has
been dropping steadily...

210
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:23,479
- It's 74 now.
- At this rate...

211
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:27,463
We're gonna prone him. Buddy in
New York says it helps. Sometimes.

212
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:43,720
How is Claire feeling?

213
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:48,284
I assume she's exhausted.

214
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:50,523
That isn't a feeling.
How is she feeling?

215
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:53,430
It's a little tough to tell,
Shaun. She's wearing a mask.

216
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:57,300
Exactly. You can't tell if
she's happy or if she's sad,

217
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:00,135
you can't tell if I'm
sad or if I'm happy.

218
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:01,902
You seem distressingly happy.

219
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:05,103
It's exciting. I can't read people,
now no one can read people.

220
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:08,114
We're all forced to rely
on more reliable markers,

221
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,649
like what people are saying.

222
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:12,481
Since you can't tell from
my face, I'll use my words.

223
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:14,817
I feel terrible, we
all feel terrible.

224
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:17,982
Because we spent the last 18
hours watching people get sicker,

225
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:20,925
we didn't help anyone, we just
fended off death for a little while.

226
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:24,156
We're all pretty disgusted at the
joy you're taking from this situation.

227
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,392
- Give him a break.
- You're enjoying this too.

228
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:30,527
All elective surgeries have been
canceled so no one is a surgeon anymore,

229
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:32,071
- not just you.
- Claire...

230
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:36,936
We're all exhausted. And
tomorrow won't be any different.

231
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:40,537
But it'd help if we didn't hate
each other when that time comes.

232
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:33,491
You work in a hospital?

233
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:34,891
Yes.

234
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:37,988
Could you wait for
the next elevator?

235
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:43,402
I appreciate you.

236
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:49,708
No.

237
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:51,801
- What's wrong?
- No, no!

238
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:53,870
But they had toilet
paper. 12 rolls. Double ply.

239
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:57,178
No! No! This is Lea's cabinet.

240
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,718
But she's not using it now...

241
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:01,583
It needs to stay free. For
when she comes back.

242
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:03,748
This is my apartment.

243
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:07,692
You had no right to put anything
anywhere without my permission.

244
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:22,441
I miss Kellan and Mia too.

245
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,907
What do they have to
do with Lea's cabinet?

246
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,505
You miss her, Shaun.

247
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:33,019
No, I don't. If I saw Lea, she
might be exposed to COVID

248
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:34,678
and she might get sick.

249
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,050
I don't want that.

250
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:39,456
And yet, you miss her.

251
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:48,133
Why would I want something
that isn't what I want?

252
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,034
Why do people on
diets want ice cream?

253
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:57,739
I thought the ECMO was
supposed to help her heart.

254
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,779
It's taken some of
the strain off of it,

255
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:03,145
but her own immune system
is still attacking her organs.

256
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:05,582
The steroids were
supposed to stop that.

257
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:08,815
We switched to a stronger
medication. So hopefully, that'll help.

258
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:14,955
This is from her
bedside table at home.

259
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:17,929
I gave it to her for
Mother's Day when I was 13.

260
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:22,325
- Would you like me to...
- Please, can I bring it to her?

261
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:28,539
I'm sorry, Lashelle, I
can't. It's just too risky...

262
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:33,444
I don't care what happens to
me. My mother is in there, all alone,

263
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:34,946
hooked up to a machine.

264
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:40,112
I just need to see her,
and tell her that I love her.

265
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:45,983
I can't.

266
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:15,313
Your lungs are filling with fluid and
secretions. Suction catheter, please.

267
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:17,321
<i>Is that from COVID?</i>

268
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:20,724
I guess so. I don't
know. It keeps changing.

269
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:24,161
Probably in combination with the
bacterial pneumonia he's developed.

270
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,756
<i>First, I probably
brought this home to him,</i>

271
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,892
<i>then I sent him to the
hospital where he's...</i>

272
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:32,302
- Don't blame yourself, I'll be fine.
- I need to suction out your lungs.

273
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:35,739
I'm going to feed this tube up your
nose and down into your airway.

274
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:37,674
It will be quite uncomfortable.

275
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:43,808
Please try not to grab my arm.

276
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,386
Take deep breaths...

277
00:19:58,664 --> 00:19:59,962
We need to prone her.

278
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,364
We can't, she's pregnant.

279
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:04,871
That's why I bought this off Michelle
in PT. She does pregnancy massage.

280
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:24,514
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm on
another call. Can you hold it down?

281
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,185
- You can close your door.
- Okay.

282
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:30,423
I'm making cioppino for
Merchant Marine Night.

283
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:35,062
- Where did you get the clams?
- I ran out to Bruno's.

284
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:36,762
You ran out to buy clams?

285
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:40,739
I wore a mask and they were
really good about social distancing.

286
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:43,867
I'm sorry, I'm not supposed
to go to the hospital,

287
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:45,536
where I possibly
could save lives,

288
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:49,548
but you can go to Bruno's to buy
clams for Merchant Marine Night?

289
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:53,552
I'm younger than you, I have
no history of health issues,

290
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:57,715
and unlike a hospital, Bruno's
is not a petri dish of COVID.

291
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:03,093
Now, this whole menu planned, I
thought I could wear my uniform.

292
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:04,095
And you could...

293
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:05,961
We're on quarantine,
we're not on a cruise.

294
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:09,468
I know, but I thought since we're
stuck at home, we can have some fun.

295
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:11,128
It's not a party,
it's a pandemic.

296
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:12,831
I don't have time
for theme dinners,

297
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:15,841
elaborate menus
and sourdough starter.

298
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:24,448
Okay. We could at
least dress up for dinner.

299
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:27,146
Yeah.

300
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:44,195
<i>Were you able
to drain his lungs?</i>

301
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:52,306
Yes. Why are you here?

302
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:56,509
<i>It helps Martin relax.
Knowing that I'm around.</i>

303
00:21:58,584 --> 00:22:01,611
Do you think it helps
Martin miss you less?

304
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,882
<i>Yeah. Yes.</i>

305
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:18,569
Martin has a heart murmur.

306
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:21,505
<i>- What?</i>
- Martin! Martin!

307
00:22:21,574 --> 00:22:23,099
Hello, I'm glad you're awake.

308
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:26,145
You may have a bacterial
abscess on your heart valve.

309
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:27,680
- That sounds really bad.
- It is.

310
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:30,375
COVID's complications
are not consistent.

311
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:34,648
It's becoming annoying. I'll tell you
more on the way to the procedure.

312
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,757
ECMO isn't working for her?

313
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,490
She's pulseless V-Tach.
Epi in the crash cart.

314
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:51,669
Pushing epi.

315
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,210
One hundred and
twenty joules. Clear.

316
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:04,914
V-fib now.

317
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:08,516
Pushing amiodarone, 300 in.

318
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:12,254
Two hundred joules. Clear.

319
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:44,414
I'm sorry.

320
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:22,952
Seventeen deaths in
the county yesterday,

321
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:24,621
up by two from the day before.

322
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:26,962
<i>Too small to draw
any conclusions.</i>

323
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:28,933
<i>What were the new
case numbers again?</i>

324
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:30,765
They're also up by 112.

325
00:24:31,537 --> 00:24:33,335
<i>Does Shaun look okay to you?</i>

326
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:35,237
- I'm fine.
- He looks fine.

327
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,835
<i>I wasn't asking you. You'll lie.
Kellan, how does Shaun look?</i>

328
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:42,143
- I'm fine.
<i>- He looks tired, right?</i>

329
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:44,706
I am tired, but I'm also fine.

330
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:47,150
Lea, Shaun's fine,
he just misses you.

331
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:49,779
No, no, I don't. I miss
having sex with you.

332
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:51,881
Hey, not alone,
teenager present.

333
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:53,858
Does Kellan not
know what sex is?

334
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:56,293
He's graduating high
school in two weeks.

335
00:24:56,362 --> 00:24:58,524
- Congratulations, Kellan.
<i>- Thanks.</i>

336
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:02,034
He knows. He doesn't want to
hear about you having it. Neither do I.

337
00:25:02,101 --> 00:25:07,369
Does he think Lea and I don't have
sex? Because we do, a lot. Or we did.

338
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:09,999
We're all sure you do. We
don't need to talk about it...

339
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:12,340
Sexual intimacy is beautiful.

340
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,174
I'm gonna skip breakfast.

341
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:17,043
<i>You miss me.</i>

342
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:21,149
No, we talk twice a day.

343
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,587
The only difference is
the lack of physical contact.

344
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:25,647
Which reduces
your risk of infection.

345
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:29,252
But I do miss sex. Don't you?

346
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,029
<i>I do.</i>

347
00:25:32,598 --> 00:25:34,658
We can't do that over the phone.

348
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:37,501
<i>That's not really true.</i>

349
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,036
Go on.

350
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:44,338
<i>Call me after work.
When you're alone.</i>

351
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,573
Oh.

352
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:55,777
Are you muted?

353
00:25:57,456 --> 00:25:59,322
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry to bother you.

354
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:04,589
- When can you take a break?
- Can you come back in an hour?

355
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:07,064
You really should take a break.

356
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:09,829
Just get out of
the house for a bit.

357
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,768
It'll help you work better.

358
00:26:11,837 --> 00:26:15,274
You need to stretch your
legs, and stretch your mind.

359
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:19,903
Can you come back in... Oh, man!

360
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:21,537
Are you working?

361
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:31,088
Who is GoodPlaceFan 793?

362
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:34,593
I don't know, but whoever he is, he's
richer than he was five minutes ago.

363
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,788
I wanna go on a walk,
can I just finish this?

364
00:26:36,862 --> 00:26:40,890
No! No need. You just play as
long as you want with your friends.

365
00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:53,109
Vegetations from the abscess
had implanted on your mitral valve.

366
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:54,908
A narrow-margin sharp dissection

367
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,677
left enough leaflet to
allow a primary repair...

368
00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:59,650
We expect a full
recovery of the heart.

369
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:02,654
Of the heart? What
about the rest of me?

370
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:05,316
Unfortunately, your lungs
are still compromised...

371
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:10,125
<i>What was that?</i>

372
00:27:11,597 --> 00:27:13,156
Someone's going home.

373
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:18,035
<i>♪ Celebrate good times Come on ♪</i>

374
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:24,376
Your lungs have a lot of
inflammation and swelling.

375
00:27:24,443 --> 00:27:26,878
We need to put you on
a non-rebreather mask

376
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:29,039
and hope it gets
your O2 level up.

377
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:33,176
That doesn't sound promising.
Isn't there anything else you can do?

378
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:34,943
No.

379
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:41,520
You need to go on a ventilator.
So I'm gonna sedate you.

380
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:44,686
For how long?

381
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:47,733
Hopefully just a few
days. But it could be longer.

382
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:52,196
My baby is due in two weeks.

383
00:27:52,938 --> 00:27:54,406
This is better for both of you.

384
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,373
- If I don't make it...
- You will.

385
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:04,748
Your baby is safe. You're
young, you're strong.

386
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:16,223
<i>Sex is not just about touch.</i>

387
00:28:16,295 --> 00:28:20,995
<i>It's about imagery,
emotion, connection...</i>

388
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:24,093
Oh, but touch is
very, very important.

389
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:27,401
<i>I mean, there will be touch.</i>

390
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:31,500
<i>But I won't be touching you
and you won't be touching me.</i>

391
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,377
<i>Are your ears okay?</i>

392
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:37,877
They hurt. Because of COVID,
I have to wear two masks

393
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:40,886
and the elastics cut into
the skin behind my ears.

394
00:28:40,953 --> 00:28:43,422
You're going to masturbate
while I masturbate?

395
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:48,190
<i>Yeah, and we'll
talk to each other.</i>

396
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,252
That sounds very distracting.

397
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:52,230
<i>We're going to talk about sex.</i>

398
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:57,197
<i>Tell me what you're doing to me.</i>

399
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,967
Looking at you on my computer.

400
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,531
<i>What do you wish you
were doing with me?</i>

401
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:08,472
Kissing you.

402
00:29:08,547 --> 00:29:10,072
<i>Mm-hm...</i>

403
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:13,110
But what if I have
COVID? Then you'd...

404
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:15,279
<i>I'm unfastening your belt.</i>

405
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:18,586
No, no, you're not. I
don't have my belt on.

406
00:29:18,657 --> 00:29:24,460
<i>Okay, no belt. Shaun, just close
your eyes and imagine we are...</i>

407
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:28,022
If I close my eyes,
then I can't see you, Lea.

408
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,966
And I can't see
most of you anyway.

409
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:32,470
<i>- You can remember.</i>
- No, this is stupid.

410
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:36,235
I don't want to pretend to have
sex with you, I want to be with you.

411
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:44,143
<i>I miss you too, Shaun.</i>

412
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:08,773
Any cough?

413
00:30:09,608 --> 00:30:11,372
- Any fever?
- No.

414
00:30:11,443 --> 00:30:12,604
Any shortness of breath?

415
00:30:12,678 --> 00:30:13,839
Sore throat? Loss of smell?

416
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:17,007
No, no, none of that. Just
searing abdominal pain...

417
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:21,477
and the runs. I'm pretty sure
it's my diverticulitis acting up.

418
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:24,318
My roommate is deeply
into pandemic baking.

419
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:28,684
I've avoided coming in. I
don't wanna catch COVID.

420
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,320
Have a seat. Non-COVID floor.

421
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:34,366
NPO, IV acetaminophen for pain
while he waits on his abdominal CT.

422
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:36,231
No food?

423
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:38,566
Usually, my first stop with
an abdominal pain patient

424
00:30:38,637 --> 00:30:39,696
is the cafeteria.

425
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:43,008
It's Ambar. Repetitive late
decels. I got a baby coming.

426
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:44,075
Go.

427
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:53,476
Thank you. I know you're busy.

428
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:56,721
What can I help you
with? Are you doing okay?

429
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:03,252
My mother had a necklace, a
cross, she wore it every day.

430
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:04,694
I'm hoping to get it back.

431
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:11,402
Uh... The patients' things
are all being held in one place.

432
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:14,702
We're not supposed to
release them until after the crisis.

433
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:21,003
I'm so sorry.

434
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:24,374
Thank you.

435
00:31:29,788 --> 00:31:31,017
Okay, um...

436
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:38,596
Let me see if I can find it. I'll
clean it and get it back to you.

437
00:31:47,706 --> 00:31:50,175
Wanted to let you know
that it'll be quiet around here

438
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:54,407
for a little while. I'm taking a
walk on the beach with Susie.

439
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:56,744
We will stay six feet apart.

440
00:31:56,815 --> 00:32:00,252
Six feet is the absolute minimum.
It's still considered quite a risk.

441
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,322
So not only do you not
wanna do things with me,

442
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,950
now you don't want me to
do things with other people?

443
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:10,427
I want you to be careful like
you want me to be careful...

444
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:12,361
You don't want
me to do anything.

445
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,923
I can't go shopping,
I can't take a walk,

446
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,129
- you won't spend any time with me.
- I'm a little bit busy.

447
00:32:18,203 --> 00:32:19,262
You're playing poker!

448
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:22,171
I played poker for one
hour while I was working.

449
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,232
I spend every minute
of every day with you.

450
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:27,575
Oh, well, you should be so
happy that I'm taking a hike.

451
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,411
It'll be a long one.

452
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:38,755
- Could you please...
- Wear your damn mask.

453
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:45,829
Rodriguez or Jeter?

454
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:49,356
Easy, Jeter. I hate A-Rod
with a white-hot hate,

455
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:51,027
but it's Jeter who beat us.

456
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,995
Who's your most hated Yankee?

457
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:54,937
I never cared for Paul Revere.

458
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:56,872
Your CBC doesn't
show a high white count,

459
00:32:56,942 --> 00:32:59,468
which is atypical for
acute diverticulitis.

460
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:00,978
We'll see what
the imaging shows.

461
00:33:01,046 --> 00:33:03,515
- Will you bring Walter down to CT?
- Sure.

462
00:33:06,618 --> 00:33:09,554
Remember when they lost
game 7 to the Diamondbacks?

463
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:12,989
Oh, I cried tears of joy.

464
00:33:13,058 --> 00:33:15,857
- I feel the rump.
- Apply pressure there.

465
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:19,329
Don't be shy, we
need this baby out now.

466
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,631
Baby's out.

467
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:40,546
How's she looking, Dr. Park?

468
00:33:41,286 --> 00:33:42,345
Good.

469
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:46,722
She's pink, active,
and breathing great.

470
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:05,037
The third fuse on the left.

471
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:07,670
It looks like it hasn't
been flipped, but it has.

472
00:34:07,746 --> 00:34:12,275
You just... you turn it...
turn it off, and then back on.

473
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,443
<i>This is for the dryer?</i>

474
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:16,420
I don't want you
calling a repairman...

475
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,953
just because of a tripped fuse.

476
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:28,962
<i>The dryer is fine.
You're gonna be fine.</i>

477
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:34,570
I love you.

478
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,608
<i>- You don't need to say that.</i>
- But I want to.

479
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:39,873
<i>You don't need to. Okay?
This isn't a big moment.</i>

480
00:34:41,346 --> 00:34:42,837
<i>You'll be fine.</i>

481
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,287
Don't come off.

482
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:02,064
<i>Put the doctor on.</i>

483
00:35:09,975 --> 00:35:12,274
<i>Tell him he's going to be fine.</i>

484
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:14,745
I can't.

485
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,441
He's right.

486
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:20,576
The majority of COVID patients
who go on a ventilator never come off.

487
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,316
<i>Put the other doctor on.</i>

488
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:28,454
Martin's relative
youth is a positive.

489
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:33,360
I'm sorry, I wish I
could give you more.

490
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,204
Your daughter is beautiful.

491
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:23,711
Six-and-a-half pounds, 19
inches, completely COVID-free.

492
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:29,218
She's got your nose.

493
00:36:30,155 --> 00:36:31,555
Eats like a champ.

494
00:36:32,057 --> 00:36:34,720
Everyone on the floor
knows when she's hungry.

495
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:42,761
She just needs you to get
better so you can hold her.

496
00:36:58,016 --> 00:37:01,180
So far, good news:
no signs of diverticulitis.

497
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:03,585
- Just need to scan your...
<i>- What?</i>

498
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:06,786
<i>Scan my what?</i>

499
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:13,932
- Hello.
<i>- Put on a mask.</i>

500
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:15,762
- But I'm in the...
<i>- Put on a mask now.</i>

501
00:37:17,102 --> 00:37:20,630
<i>Walter's abdominal CT caught
the lower portion of his lungs.</i>

502
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:22,936
<i>It's not diverticulitis,
it's COVID.</i>

503
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:25,806
<i>We've both been exposed.
And so has everyone who passed</i>

504
00:37:25,877 --> 00:37:28,244
through that hallway Walter
was sitting in for an hour.

505
00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:37,150
Ambar's acidosis is getting worse.
She's not getting enough oxygen.

506
00:37:37,222 --> 00:37:39,418
- What's her ventilator's setting?
- She's maxed out.

507
00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:41,892
We can't increase pressure
without blowing out her lungs.

508
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,429
She have any family? Might
be time to notify next of kin...

509
00:37:44,496 --> 00:37:47,091
I read about a clinical rescue
therapy trial, the chill study.

510
00:37:47,165 --> 00:37:49,532
She's a good candidate,
no cytokine storm,

511
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:52,093
her troponin's low, so
are LFTs and creatinine.

512
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:53,433
Her organs are in good shape.

513
00:37:53,505 --> 00:37:56,475
So why not freeze them and paralyze
virtually every muscle in her body?

514
00:37:57,175 --> 00:37:59,940
Lowering the temperature
reduces her inflammatory response

515
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:04,278
and her need for oxygen. And it's
better than calling her next of kin.

516
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:08,116
She'll require constant monitoring,
we're already overstretched.

517
00:38:08,186 --> 00:38:11,486
I'll do it. I'll take full
responsibility for her.

518
00:38:20,565 --> 00:38:22,466
- Who's there?
- It's Lea.

519
00:38:23,001 --> 00:38:26,096
- You can't come in.
- I got you something.

520
00:38:26,571 --> 00:38:29,905
That's too bad. You can't
come in to give it to me.

521
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:49,284
I saw online, doctors are using
these to help with their masks.

522
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:53,798
You attach an elastic to each
arm, so they don't rub your ears.

523
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,143
It is better. Thank you.

524
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:15,212
I know I can't come in, but...

525
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:18,319
I don't wanna leave.

526
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,430
You can stay there.

00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:47,145
Park's making pancakes.

531
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,517
Mm. That's great.

532
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:53,687
He's done it before.
They weren't very good.

533
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,558
Why?

534
00:39:57,729 --> 00:40:02,292
They were not very good. I
don't know, but I told him, I said:

535
00:40:02,934 --> 00:40:07,804
"Dr. Park, these pancakes are not
very good. You need to do better."
