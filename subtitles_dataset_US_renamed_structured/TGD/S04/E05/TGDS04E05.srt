1
00:00:02,636 --> 00:00:03,797
It's just a migraine.

2
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:05,863
Honey, until we're
completely sure...

3
00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:08,766
Is the pain a tight
band or pulsating?

4
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:10,303
Good question.

5
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:14,710
Pulsating, light bothers me,
nausea. I get these all the time.

6
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:17,615
You said you can feel a...
What did you call it? A...

7
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,209
An aura. I know, but...

8
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:21,585
Exactly how often do
you get these symptoms?

9
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:24,887
I just ask, since your boyfriend
doesn't seem to recognize them.

10
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:33,600
Zane and I have only known
each other for eight days.

11
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:34,999
It moved fast.

12
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:42,568
Ellie. Did you feel
your foot twitch?

13
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:44,343
No.

14
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:54,945
Positive Babinsky.

15
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:56,715
What does that mean?

16
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,985
It's not a migraine.

17
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:27,013
Oh, that.

18
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,522
I was performing due
diligence on my new roommate,

19
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,958
who might be a violent maniac,
and look what I found in his closet.

20
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:34,551
It's cute.

21
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:37,462
You moved in with two suitcases.
You only have four pairs of underwear.

22
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:39,397
How the hell did a
parrot make the cut?

23
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:42,159
I'm a Parrothead. A
Jimmy Buffett enthusiast.

24
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:43,996
The "Margaritaville" guy?

25
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:47,041
Well, he has other, far better songs,
but yes, the "Margaritaville" guy.

26
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,268
It brings me luck.

27
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:50,502
Scary to think what your
life would be like without it.

28
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,111
Can I have it back?

29
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:57,774
It's fun getting to know you better.
Worth every damn bit of sacrifice.

30
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:06,726
Ooh!

31
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:10,522
I was demonstrating a torch
lift this morning and, bang.

32
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:14,234
"Ballet master."
You're a dancer?

33
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,634
God, no, I'm like the CEO.

34
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:19,370
At my age, I'd be the
Betty White of the troupe.

35
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,463
Is she a dancer?

36
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:24,400
I don't know much about culture.

37
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,574
I assume I just sprained
something, right?

38
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:31,881
Uh, we will need neuro
and abdominal exams,

39
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:34,148
X-rays for fractures,
CBC for infection,

40
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:36,190
cultures to rule out
a spinal abscess...

41
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,851
You're... new, aren't you?

42
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:42,987
It's my second week here.

43
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:48,564
It's actually only my
first day seeing patients.

44
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,160
Am I your first?

45
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:53,469
Yes. Sorry. But yes.

46
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:57,476
Well, that's impressive.

47
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:01,205
Whoever is supervising
you must really trust you.

48
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:06,213
I'm not sure that's true.

49
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,949
They won't let me
join their stupid gym

50
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,856
because I had
high blood pressure.

51
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:14,886
How am I supposed to
lower it if I can't work out?

52
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:17,693
Two hundred over
105. That is quite high.

53
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:19,426
I just told you it was high.

54
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:23,168
Are you a smoker?

55
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:26,536
Yeah. Pack or two a
day. More if I feel crappy.

56
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:27,801
And...

57
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:30,900
do you have diabetes?

58
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:32,878
You reading those
questions out of a book?

59
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,482
- Yes.
- Have you ever done this before?

60
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:42,984
- I told you. You have to trust them.
- I don't.

61
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,922
Then act like you do.

62
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:48,590
Go away.

63
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:58,739
Nothing more romantic than spending
one of your first dates in an E.R.

64
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:01,673
Well, stressful experiences
release oxytocin,

65
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,836
same hormone that
creates emotional bonds.

66
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,038
This might actually
cement their relationship.

67
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:09,911
Next to the hippocampus.

68
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,583
Is that a tooth?

69
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:14,916
Dermoid cyst. Cool.

70
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:16,915
She's having a seizure.

71
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:20,089
Secure her airway, push
two milligrams Ativan.

72
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:29,621
- Thank you for trusting us enough...
- Please report.

73
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,138
Uh, 58-year-old male
dancer with back pain.

74
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,243
I ruled out red flags like
osteomyelitis and kidney infection.

75
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:39,211
But I did find evidence of a
mild L2 compression fracture

76
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,058
with moderate wedging and evidence
of impingement on the neural canal...

77
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:43,675
You want to start beta blockers?

78
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:48,385
Me? Yeah. I think my patient's
a stroke risk. BP's 200 over 105.

79
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,851
It was the same
at her gym earlier?

80
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:02,166
Can you raise your arms?

81
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,838
Okay. Now, try to
squeeze my hands?

82
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:07,465
I did all these tests with her.

83
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,567
You're gonna give me
stuff to lower blood pressure.

84
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:13,011
That would kill you. Now
push against my hands.

85
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,957
If she's in danger
of having a stroke...

86
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,643
She's not. She's
already having one.

87
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:18,685
Smoking on estrogen
put her at high risk,

88
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:21,085
loss of circadian blood
pressure variation confirms it.

89
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,722
Stick out your tongue.

90
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:27,753
We gotta get a CTA...

91
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,093
No. We're treating with IV tPA.

92
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,529
Don't we need
to locate the clot?

93
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:35,592
We just did. Right deviation means
a right vertebral artery occlusion.

94
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:39,868
You can close your mouth now.

95
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:49,148
Her seizure and coma were
caused by a dermoid cyst.

96
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:52,712
It's a pocket of tissue with
bits of teeth, hair, and fat.

97
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:54,687
She likely got it
before she was born.

98
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:55,754
What can you do?

99
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,751
The less invasive option is to put
in a drain to release some pressure,

100
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:02,022
treat with anti-seizure
meds and steroids,

101
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:05,031
then basically watch to see
if the swelling goes down.

102
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:06,691
And the more invasive?

103
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:07,766
Surgical removal.

104
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:12,706
But the cyst is deep inside and
wrapped around major arteries.

105
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:16,231
So it is more likely
to fix the problem,

106
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:19,768
but it carries risk of
stroke or paralysis.

107
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:24,312
We need a decision quickly.

108
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:26,510
Ellie's sister is
on the paperwork,

109
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,521
but we haven't been
able to reach her.

110
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:31,820
Do you know where the
parents live, or any other siblings?

111
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:40,394
He might still be on a
business trip, but, uh...

112
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:44,336
you can try her husband.

113
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:58,308
If we can't reduce the swelling, she
will have permanent brain damage.

114
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:07,326
Is that him?

115
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:12,131
Brendan.

116
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,701
We need you to make a decision.

117
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:19,099
Yeah, yeah. I'm not sure
that I'm the right one to...

118
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:23,335
I mean, right now...

119
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:26,912
I hate her.

120
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:35,084
You don't. You're
angry. You're hurt.

121
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:37,584
Because you love her.

122
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,797
Fifty-eight-year-old male
dancer with back pain.

123
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,738
Moderate vertebral wedging and
impingement on the neural canal.

124
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,972
Yes. I think an L2
compression fracture.

125
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:04,746
Prescribe anti-inflammatories,
a brace, and PT.

126
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,047
Then discharge him.

127
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:11,019
Do you want to
re-check anything?

128
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,329
No.

129
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:31,670
Remember to floss your
brain after every meal, people.

130
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:34,713
Aspirating.

131
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,678
Do you think we
should be doing this?

132
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:41,620
I know we have to legally, but
maybe her husband isn't the one

133
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,556
who knows her best,
knows what she wants.

134
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:47,389
Better than the guy who met
her last weekend. Arachnoid knife.

135
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,191
Well, that guy,
she's in love with him.

136
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:52,027
- Apparently.
- Maybe she loves them both.

137
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:55,629
Aren't you a romantic.
Watch for perforators.

138
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:57,760
I've been polyamorous for years.

139
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,641
Well, when I was monogamous,
I was jealous, possessive,

140
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:06,771
egotistical.

141
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,838
Our patient wasn't
honest, that's not cool,

142
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:10,008
but other than that...

143
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:14,853
Good margins all around.

144
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:17,481
Let's dry up the field
and close her up.

145
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,820
I never would've guessed
I was your first patient.

146
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,264
Felt more like the fourth.

147
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,696
By the way, did I
detect an accent?

148
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:30,769
No.

149
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:34,999
I mean, I had one, but I
worked really hard to lose it.

150
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,573
No one ever notices it anymore.

151
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,640
Eastern Europe?

152
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,880
Brooklyn.

153
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:46,344
Williamsburg. I grew up
Hasidic, speaking Yiddish.

154
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,819
I left it a long time ago.

155
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:49,949
You left the religion?

156
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:54,018
The religion, the
culture, my family.

157
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:59,163
It must not have been
easy, growing up that way,

158
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:02,795
knowing you were a doctor.

159
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:08,767
- Excuse me?
- My generation, you could get bashed.

160
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,504
You could get thrown in jail.

161
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,209
We had to learn codes,
how to read each other.

162
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,101
You should thank
your lucky stars

163
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:17,981
you get to live your
life the way you want it.

164
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,723
I don't know what
you went through.

165
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,521
Please don't pretend to
know what I went through.

166
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:34,330
- Sir?
- My gut.

167
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:41,697
Code blue!

168
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:45,978
The surgery seemed successful,

169
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:49,015
but we need to monitor for
seizures over the next 24 hours.

170
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,779
Is this high enough?

171
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:55,219
Little to the left. No,
to the right. Yeah.

172
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:03,526
You never said
anything was wrong.

173
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,267
Can we have the
room for a moment?

174
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,831
I'm sorry, but we
really need to check...

175
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:14,238
You're worried about talking in
front of them? Embarrassing me?

176
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,841
I didn't think
anything was wrong.

177
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:25,551
When I met Zane, it...

178
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,355
made me realize
something was missing.

179
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,086
Or at least, I think
that's what I'm feeling.

180
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:37,481
- You mind tilting your chin up?
- Sorry.

181
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,029
Why couldn't you
just talk to me?

182
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,034
Or... Or leave me?

183
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,034
I don't know.

184
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,043
Were you happy?

185
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:00,786
With him?

186
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:12,629
I guess I should go.

187
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:16,802
Brendan?

188
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,433
Who are these people?

189
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,337
- Ellie, do you know where you are?
- Wait, why am I in the hospital?

190
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,259
Suprarenal aortic aneurysm.

191
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:42,693
It ruptured as he
was being discharged.

192
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,924
- Clamping aorta now.
- How much blood is he down?

193
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:48,435
We suctioned out two liters and
gave six units on the rapid infuser.

194
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:52,637
The aneurysm caused his
back pain. Dr. Wolke missed it.

195
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,003
I did an abdominal exam.

196
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,203
Aneurysms are
very hard to catch.

197
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,873
Experienced doctors miss
them all the time. Pott's scissors.

198
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:04,315
The aneurysm is 6.5 centimeters.

199
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:06,980
Dr. Wolke should have felt it.

200
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:14,287
It felt like normal
musculature. I'm so sorry.

201
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,828
We'll never know what you felt.

202
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:18,790
There's no way to know if you,
or any doctor, for that matter,

203
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:20,333
would have detected this.

204
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:22,496
I would have.

205
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:25,471
He asked me if I
wanted to double-check.

206
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:28,058
If I had, I would have caught
the aneurysm before the rupture...

207
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:29,107
Stop it.

208
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,313
He made a mistake.

209
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,145
He might have. But you did too.

210
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:39,583
No. You told me to back off.

211
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,712
I didn't tell you to
abdicate responsibility.

212
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:50,560
When a first-year asks if you
want to re-check their work,

213
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,690
your answer should
always be yes.

214
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:57,533
The fact they're
asking is a warning sign.

215
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:02,569
I didn't know that.

216
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:13,176
It's called retrograde
memory loss.

217
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:16,017
Luckily, it seems to have been
temporary. She's lucid again.

218
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:21,427
We're running an MRI and
lab tests to see what caused it.

219
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:24,623
Thank you for telling
me. I know I'm just the...

220
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:27,065
You care.

221
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:33,765
Maybe things with Ellie and I
weren't always perfect, but...

222
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,899
It was exciting.

223
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:38,070
When I was with her...

224
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:41,307
I'd never felt that way before.

225
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:45,250
I took care of her when
she was sick, I never strayed.

226
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:48,083
And it wasn't about the
things we did, it was about...

227
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:50,922
being with her.

228
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,953
She stuck by me
when I needed her.

229
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,095
Last year, I was... I was
drinking way too much.

230
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,999
It's hard to imagine
being without her.

231
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,509
I just can't imagine
being without her.

232
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:21,618
She's stable. Q-hour neuro exams
and monitor for signs of elevated ICP.

233
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,592
I believe you're
getting a call, Dr. Park.

234
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:36,770
You're a Parrothead.
Wear it proud.

235
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,767
Can we just agree
to have some limits?

236
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,900
Maybe not everything
I own is fair game.

237
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,170
Mm, no.

238
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:45,910
Perfect.

239
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:48,607
Trust me. It'll be worth
every damn bit of sacrifice.

240
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:53,452
I've said that twice now.

241
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,998
You've said a lot of things
twice. You have limited creativity.

242
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:57,062
It wasn't creative at all.

243
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,168
It's from Jimmy Buffett's
"Cheeseburger in Paradise,"

244
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:01,161
one of his "Big Eight,"
so big even I know it.

245
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:03,128
You, sir, are no Parrothead.

246
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,066
Mia does woodwork
as a side hustle.

247
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,296
She made it for me on
our first trip to Hawaii.

248
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:13,134
Lovely. Wait, no, that's
not right. "Pathetic"?

249
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:15,766
And do you toss away all
mementos of past friends and jobs?

250
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:18,175
If a job cheated on me,
I might want to move on.

251
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,379
When's the last time
you dated someone?

252
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,406
When's the last time you
acted like a human being?

253
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:23,939
So years?

254
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,485
Yeah, I definitely
found the right word.

255
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:27,786
See you at home.

256
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,596
You can't sleep?

257
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:40,059
You want some warm milk?

258
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:43,232
My mother has like
18 prescriptions for this,

259
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:45,635
some of them are
actual prescriptions.

260
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:49,565
I can sleep, but need to figure
out how to supervise better.

261
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,111
How many of these are
you planning to read tonight?

262
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,410
Just the relevant
sections of each.

263
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:58,645
Tech bros are always watching
TED Talks on leadership.

264
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:00,238
That could be quicker
than those books.

265
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,888
How about tomorrow
we have a date night?

266
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,953
Why would we need a date night

267
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,295
if we're in a relationship
and living together?

268
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,925
Because it'll be fun.

269
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:17,198
I'll schedule date
night for tomorrow.

270
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,432
Great. Think of
something for us to do.

271
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,910
There is one thing that
helps most people sleep

272
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:28,447
that my mother did
not tell me about...

273
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,288
<i>What makes a great manager?</i>

274
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:38,017
<i>Some say it's all
about planning.</i>

275
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,525
<i>Others, charismatic leadership.</i>

276
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:41,822
<i>A third group...</i>

277
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:46,497
Your temporary memory
loss was caused by some fat

278
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:47,864
that leaked from your cyst.

279
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,268
We can remove
it via a craniotomy,

280
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:53,636
but there is a real risk
of more memory loss.

281
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:55,038
Maybe permanently.

282
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,775
What will I lose?

283
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:59,835
The time prior to the surgery.

284
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,245
Days, weeks, possibly months.

285
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:06,052
But if we don't operate soon, the
risk of brain damage only grows.

286
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:09,721
I can't do it.

287
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,260
I don't even know
what I want right now,

288
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:21,729
but I do know that I don't want
the decision about my marriage

289
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:23,133
forced on me by an operation.

290
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,600
Please. Find another answer.

291
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:44,323
You are not very good at your jobs
and I'm not very good at teaching you.

292
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,791
So we are going to focus
on one step at a time.

293
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,919
You will master
each skill separately.

294
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:50,861
I've made a list of 400 skills.

295
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,331
I didn't have time to
finish it last night because...

296
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,229
Dr. Wolke, you will be
focusing on physical exams,

297
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,063
you'll find a list of the
seven post-op tests

298
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:00,232
to be conducted on Carl.

299
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,332
Dr. Jackson, you'll
find relevant seminars

300
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:04,206
on conquering nerves
in the workplace.

301
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:06,108
What are good
activities for a date?

302
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:08,606
What does she like?

303
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:10,047
Cars, coding,

304
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:12,312
<i>Zelda: Breath of the
Wild,</i> Sauvignon Blanc,

305
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:15,148
Skittles, <i>RuPaul's
Drag Race,</i> camping...

306
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:17,486
I had a very romantic
time camping in Big Sur.

307
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:18,956
This is for tonight.

308
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,887
I haven't gone on many dates.

309
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,058
But everyone loves movies.

310
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:45,315
Healing nicely. No
redness or swelling.

311
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,154
I'm going to palpate
around it now.

312
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:54,353
Look, I need to apologize.

313
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:57,420
For bringing up your
personal life the other day.

314
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:04,362
No. You have nothing
to apologize to me for.

315
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:09,970
So what's next on your list?

316
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:14,105
Checking for signs of
infection inside your abdomen.

317
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:17,975
Open your eyes wider.

318
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:25,252
You have signs of jaundice.

319
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:28,784
I think your liver is failing.

320
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:37,966
The liver is being damaged
by a new aneurysm.

321
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:40,597
How? A genetic
predisposition or...

322
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:42,505
More likely when
we fixed the first one,

323
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,134
we increased the
pressure upstream.

324
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:46,669
Can we stent the celiac?

325
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:47,975
Anatomy's too tricky.

326
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:50,882
Aortic to celiac bypass?

327
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,419
We'd just risk a new
aneurysm forming upstream.

328
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,754
Maybe, but it solves
the problem in front of us.

329
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:57,187
He'll die without
an intervention.

330
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,657
He'll probably die either way.

331
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:07,729
Let's all take the time to
research alternate solutions.

332
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,100
If we can't come up with
something better in 24 hours,

333
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,365
we proceed with the bypass.

334
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:32,453
She's saying no for
emotional reasons.

335
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:36,252
So the answer isn't medical.

336
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:37,455
It's emotional.

337
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:44,660
We think Zane
should talk to Ellie...

338
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:47,297
No. I don't want him
anywhere near her.

339
00:21:47,373 --> 00:21:50,309
To convince her to
do the craniotomy.

340
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:55,538
From you, it's
self-serving. From Zane...

341
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:58,744
Wait. If she doesn't want it...

342
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:01,344
You said you can't
imagine life without her.

343
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:05,986
If you meant that, you'd risk
anything to keep her alive.

344
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:08,721
Including her memories of you.

345
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:25,642
Well done, Shaunie.

346
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:30,746
I really needed this.

347
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:34,053
The system update
yesterday went bananas.

348
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:36,351
I've been flooded
with complaints.

349
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:37,883
Total nightmare.

350
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:41,694
How's work? Did the videos help?

351
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,784
Yes.

352
00:22:45,431 --> 00:22:46,592
Tell me more.

353
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:51,463
One of my patients developed
a secondary aneurysm.

354
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:54,029
Now, I need to find a
surgical fix by tomorrow.

355
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:57,167
Otherwise, he will probably
die. I brought Skittles.

356
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:01,804
Shouldn't you be
at the hospital?

357
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:06,046
Yes. After you go to bed, I
plan to go back and do research.

358
00:23:07,353 --> 00:23:10,221
Shaunie, go to the hospital.

359
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:12,451
No. We made this schedule.

360
00:23:14,093 --> 00:23:15,686
Someone else needs you.

361
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:17,996
More than I need you.

362
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:22,262
It's a hospital. It's
filled with sick people.

363
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:24,803
But tomorrow, will
someone need you

364
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,896
to come up with a
way to save their life?

365
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:28,765
Maybe.

366
00:23:31,844 --> 00:23:34,245
Probably not tomorrow.

367
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:37,675
Okay.

368
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:48,789
I am canceling date night.

369
00:23:49,295 --> 00:23:51,127
- That's rude.
- Oh, well.

370
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:00,838
Then...

371
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,069
I should...

372
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:05,472
go to the hospital.

373
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:07,411
Mm-hm.

374
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:17,355
They're prepping
Ellie for surgery.

375
00:24:18,424 --> 00:24:19,756
Any last-minute questions?

376
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:24,788
What should I do?

377
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:29,033
Forgive her.

378
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:33,037
Under the right circumstances,
every human will stray.

379
00:24:33,105 --> 00:24:34,835
We're not hardwired
for monogamy.

380
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:38,037
I'm guessing you're not married.

381
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:40,304
I'm not saying that
it's wrong to feel angry.

382
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:42,742
She wasn't honest with you.

383
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:48,445
But the alternative to forgiving
her is losing someone that you love.

384
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:54,058
Then what?

385
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:59,359
If she comes back to me
just because she forgets him...

386
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:03,864
my marriage wouldn't be honest.

387
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,210
I have an idea.

388
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:19,144
We could remove more proximal
aorta and extend the graft.

389
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:22,086
And rebuild the
celiac trunk with what?

390
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:23,383
Dacron?

391
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:24,787
Branches are too complex.

392
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:28,684
This Lancet article
on polymer materials...

393
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:32,923
doesn't work, but...
thin-film nitinol?

394
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:44,338
Did we break him?

395
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:51,913
We have the material.

396
00:25:55,354 --> 00:25:56,720
It's his veins.

397
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:08,189
- Hey.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

398
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:10,361
Did we reestablish
personal boundaries?

399
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:15,632
This morning's presentation
is on... who's not moving on?

400
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,706
Exhibit A.

401
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:20,507
Canoodling on a very
romantic hillside with...

402
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,275
With my gay best
friend. Can you leave?

403
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:24,845
Exhibit B.

404
00:26:25,484 --> 00:26:28,784
A XXL Rob Gronkowski jersey.

405
00:26:28,854 --> 00:26:31,983
Just the latest fashion style, from
a woman who hates the Patriots

406
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:33,057
or an ex-boyfriend's...

407
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:36,085
Not an ex. I hooked up with
Gronk. Seemed worth preserving.

408
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:40,763
Rob? Or one of his brothers?

409
00:26:42,668 --> 00:26:45,968
Props, I guess.
Exhibit infinitum.

410
00:26:46,472 --> 00:26:48,566
Two ticket stubs to
<i>Quantum of Solace.</i>

411
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,200
Now, you once called
Daniel Craig "James Blond."

412
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,609
And yet, 11 years later,
these were in your drawer,

413
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,116
on top of an instruction
manual for a 2019 cellphone.

414
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:59,549
Which means you dug
them out within the last year.

415
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,951
Why? I can only assume
you are currently once again

416
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,511
hooking up with
the James Blond fan.

417
00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:06,949
- How could you possibly deduce...
- I also read your e-mails.

418
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:10,892
You've been sleeping with an ex
without asking for any commitment.

419
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,955
It's just sex. It's not
keeping me from anything.

420
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:15,262
What's more likely to prevent
someone from moving on?

421
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:17,963
A parrot in a drawer
or an ex in your bed?

422
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:20,733
I'm at least getting something
hot from the situation.

423
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:22,274
You're just
wallowing in failure.

424
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:29,643
So if your bag's empty, I'm naked
and have to go to the bathroom.

425
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:39,991
It's called a
Y-shaped vein graft.

426
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:42,186
Your aorta is damaged
from the aneurysm

427
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:43,388
right where it branches off.

428
00:27:43,462 --> 00:27:46,523
We're going to find a vein in
your leg that's similar in size,

429
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:49,591
cut it out, and use it to
replace the damaged artery.

430
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:50,668
How bad is it?

431
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,835
This is an excellent solution.

432
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:54,373
If it works.

433
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:57,506
What are the actual
chances that it doesn't?

434
00:27:58,277 --> 00:27:59,277
That I'm going to die?

435
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:01,975
I don't want to give a number.

436
00:28:03,382 --> 00:28:04,509
I mean, I can't.

437
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:07,084
I literally can't.

438
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:09,330
There are too many factors.
I can call in Dr. Murphy...

439
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:12,756
I don't need to hear
numbers. How bad is this?

440
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:20,398
Bad.

441
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:27,538
Thank you.

442
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:35,872
Whatever happens, you're
gonna be an incredible doctor.

443
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:39,541
And I am honored to
have been your first patient.

444
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:48,950
I screwed up.

445
00:28:51,263 --> 00:28:52,561
That first exam.

446
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:55,127
I felt something.

447
00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:00,270
I should have known
it was an aneurysm.

448
00:29:01,607 --> 00:29:03,405
We could have saved
you before it got bad.

449
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:07,271
Why?

450
00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:11,974
You were my first patient.

451
00:29:19,658 --> 00:29:21,422
I need you to do
something for me.

452
00:29:23,362 --> 00:29:24,625
I need you to pray.

453
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:28,834
You must know a
prayer for the sick.

454
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:33,705
I'm not a believer anymore.

455
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:37,704
Neither am I. But...

456
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,529
Ellie, do you know these men?

457
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:38,001
Of course. Brendan.

458
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:41,999
And...

459
00:30:44,743 --> 00:30:46,871
And are you a
friend of Brendan's?

460
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:50,548
Something like that.

461
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:08,965
A lot has happened
in the last week.

462
00:31:10,936 --> 00:31:14,771
So before you went under,
the doctors made a video.

463
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:20,804
It's sort of a message from
your old self to your new one.

464
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:25,583
Um...

465
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:34,249
I just want you to
know... that I love you.

466
00:31:53,812 --> 00:31:55,292
<i>Tell me about the day you met.</i>

467
00:31:57,616 --> 00:32:01,519
<i>I was in the middle of
an art exhibit in SoMa</i>

468
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:05,523
<i>and I noticed this
guy and he was...</i>

469
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:07,957
<i>looking at all the
same paintings</i>

470
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:10,457
<i>I had been looking at and, um...</i>

471
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:13,431
Need another six-O loaded
backhand for the arterial stump.

472
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:18,696
Graft is secure.

473
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,329
Take off the Satinsky clamp.

474
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:28,442
Good perfusion
to his lower body.

475
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:31,182
Heart rate's spiking.

476
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:34,447
There's no ST elevations.

477
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:39,584
BP's tanking. Did he
thrombose the graft?

478
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:44,456
Distal anastomosis is pulsatile.

479
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:49,056
But there is blood pooling
in the left lower quadrant.

480
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:50,134
The right, too.

481
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:54,497
He's bleeding
everywhere but the graft.

482
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,907
- It's DIC.
- Send a stat ROTEM and coag profile.

483
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:02,643
Start compressions, give
epinephrine and get the defib.

484
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:14,182
- Set it to 120.
- One-twenty. Clear.

485
00:33:16,061 --> 00:33:17,120
Compressions.

486
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:22,394
No response.

487
00:33:23,969 --> 00:33:26,666
Go to monophasic at 360.

488
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:29,507
Clear.

489
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:45,924
Why aren't you shocking again?

490
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,751
He's in asystole.

491
00:33:50,729 --> 00:33:51,890
Dr. Lim?

492
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:06,538
Dr. Wolke.

493
00:34:07,913 --> 00:34:09,074
He's dead.

494
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:21,485
Time of death: 7:23 p.m.

495
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:31,159
Take as much time as you need.

496
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:14,535
I was in love with him.

497
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:20,651
All those moments I had, him...
Meeting at the gallery, the conversations.

498
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:25,350
I don't remember any of them.

499
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:28,991
But they were real.

500
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:32,655
And they brought up feelings...

501
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:39,197
ones I don't remember
having for a really long time.

502
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,172
But all they made me
think of was you, Brendan.

503
00:35:52,751 --> 00:35:55,983
Hearing how I met Zane just
reminded me how you and I met.

504
00:35:56,688 --> 00:35:59,817
Chelsey's party and you showed
up in that ugly bomber jacket.

505
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:05,186
And Zane taking me to the hospital
reminded me how you nursed me

506
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:07,323
for months when I
broke my femur in Aspen.

507
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,059
And the whole time...

508
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:15,804
I just couldn't stop thinking about
how much I must have hurt you.

509
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,411
And I don't...

510
00:36:27,786 --> 00:36:31,416
I don't I know if
you can forgive me...

511
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:37,057
but I love you.

512
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,305
And I... I want to come home.

513
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:01,116
Well, you're wrong.

514
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:08,424
That bomber jacket
was really cool.

515
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:55,572
He died.

516
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:02,674
I tried stepping back.

517
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:05,876
I tried brainstorming.

518
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:09,579
And he died.

519
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:18,957
I don't know what people
are thinking or feeling.

520
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:21,124
I can't communicate what I need.

521
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,625
And more patients will die.

522
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:32,902
You don't think your ASD had
anything to do with your patient's death,

523
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:35,506
do you? Because it didn't.

524
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,346
It did.

525
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:41,409
Asher wasn't sure about
his abdominal exam.

526
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:44,316
I should have known that.

527
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:50,223
Shaun, you're going to do... most
things better than anyone else.

528
00:38:51,396 --> 00:38:52,489
And there are...

529
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:55,423
days when you're gonna
fail like everyone else.

530
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:58,494
Today might be
one of those days.

531
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:01,271
So...

532
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,204
what do you do then?

533
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:16,182
You go home, you be
with the people you love.

534
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:19,949
You take comfort in that.

535
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,721
And then you wake up
tomorrow and start all over again.

536
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,714
You can go home.

537
00:39:52,924 --> 00:39:53,924
I just...

538
00:39:56,995 --> 00:39:58,463
don't want to be
alone right now.

539
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:43,105
I opened a Bumble account today.

540
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:49,470
I swiped right
three times today.

541
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,819
Gronk's jersey didn't
have a tag in the back.

542
00:40:57,855 --> 00:40:58,879
It's symbolic.

543
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:03,451
You have any idea how much
the real one'll be worth one day?

544
00:41:04,162 --> 00:41:05,162
Fair enough.

545
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:13,771
<i>♪ Wastin' away again
in Margaritaville ♪</i>

546
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:18,538
<i>♪ Searchin' for my
lost shaker of salt ♪</i>

547
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:28,385

A woman to blame but I know ♪</i>

548
00:41:29,921 --> 00:41:32,015

549
00:42:06,758 --> 00:42:08,249
I'm glad you're here with me.

550
00:42:09,127 --> 00:42:10,127
So am I.
