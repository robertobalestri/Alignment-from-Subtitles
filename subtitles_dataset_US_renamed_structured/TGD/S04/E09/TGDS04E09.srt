1
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:06,106
Your primary care doctor was
right. The mass is on the smaller side.

2
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:07,607
We'll confirm with
the new images

3
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,700
but it should be
manageable with medication.

4
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:10,903
No surgery needed.

5
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:13,913
Well, my fiancé
will be so relieved.

6
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:16,882
He's been worried I'll look
like Frankenstein in our photos.

7
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:19,514
Also that I might die.

8
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:20,781
When's the big day?

9
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:22,321
June.

10
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,484
You've been dealing
with wedding planning

11
00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:26,424
on top of a pituitary tumor?

12
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:28,926
You deserve a medal.

13
00:00:28,996 --> 00:00:30,828
Our medical record
system on the other hand.

14
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:32,526
It has you listed as female.

15
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,529
Probably because
of the Pap smears.

16
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:38,299
Software clearly needs a
trans update. Deep breath.

17
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:41,001
I'll fix it so everything
is correct going forward.

18
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:42,736
Please confirm your
gender and pronouns?

19
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,778
Male, he, him, his.
Thanks for asking.

20
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:46,609
We're the ones with
the messed-up software.

21
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:50,012
Your scans from this
morning were just uploaded.

22
00:00:57,591 --> 00:01:00,993
In less than two weeks, the
tumor has doubled in size.

00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:15,468
Thirty-four-year-old female, Zara
Norton. Tachycardic and delirious.

00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:19,741
Dr. Guerin, update vitals. Dr. Wolke,

28

00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:27,318
Ms. Norton, smells like
you've had some marijuana?

30
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:30,323
Mm-mm. I just unloaded a
shipment at the dispensary.

31
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,689
- Test for THC and a full tox screen.
- I'm a peddler.

33
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:36,488
Run it.

34
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:39,795
BP's elevated, 180 over 115.
That could explain the delirium.

35
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:40,993
That sounds high.

36
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:43,537
I better take my meds, got
'em here, I never miss a...

37
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:45,505
Oh, no. Wait.

38
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:46,699
No, that's not it

39
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,264
BP's climbing, 210 over 120.

40
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:50,504
Enalaprilat, 1.25mg, I.V.

41
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:52,512
Do you remember the
name of your medication?

42
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:56,448
You can call me Zara. See
it says right here, on the...

43
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:58,348
Forget about the meds,
she is not taking any.

44
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:00,216
This is untreated
chronic hypertension.

45
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:02,398
What if you're wrong? What
if she's on a loop diuretic

46
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:04,342
for her pressure? This
could cause renal failure.

47
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:06,791
She's headed into
hypertensive crisis.

48
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:10,061
What if we try an angiotensin
receptor blocker? No drug interaction...

49
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,962
Angiotensin receptor
blockers work too slowly.

50
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:13,625
I'm giving her
the ACE inhibitor.

51
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:19,606
- BP's going down.
- Yeah.

52
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:20,766
Nice call.

53
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,485
Latest budget report.

54
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:42,757
Yeah. The PDF's sitting in
my inbox. I'm trying to ignore it.

55
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:43,990
And thus...

56
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,093
A sit-down visit?

57
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,898
Just checking in to
see how you're doing.

58
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,233
Okay. You?

59
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:56,004
Me? I'm... recovering from
the year, like everybody else.

60
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:57,874
Pandemic, the surge...

61
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:00,072
You were here for every
minute of every day.

62
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:01,615
It must have taken a toll.

63
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,878
I mean... Comes
with the territory.

64
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,749
You're not, stressed
or distracted?

65
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:10,517
I'm... tired.

66
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,492
Okay, well, maybe you
should take some time off?

67
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,560
No.

68
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:18,999
But thank you. I'm fine.

69
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:25,062
You don't seem fine.

70
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,309
Are there issues with
my work performance?

71
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,090
- No, you do great work.
- Then I'm not sure

72
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:35,514
why we're having
this conversation.

73
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,175
Because I'm worried about you.

74
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:40,680
Because other people
are worried about you.

75
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:44,019
There's no shame in
struggling a little bit.

76
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:48,092
You know what would be weird?
Is if you didn't struggle at all.

77
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,063
If you need to see someone,
the hospital will cover the cost.

78
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,694
Great. You'll pay my bills.

79
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:58,267
And the damage to my
reputation, who takes care of that?

80
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,137
I don't think that
seeing a therapist will...

81
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,701
affect your career.

82
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:06,811
Says the white guy.

83
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:10,883
Okay.

84
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,189
Privacy protections
are there for a reason.

85
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,917
No one needs to know.

86
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,583
Thank you for checking in.

87
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:35,507
How're you feeling?

88
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:36,599
Good.

89
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:39,512
Be better when I understand
what landed me up in here.

90
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,172
You had an acute
hypertensive crisis.

91
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:43,183
I know my blood pressure's high.

92
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,345
I'm already on medication for it.
You probably wanna know what it is.

93
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:47,682
There's no medication.

94
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:51,214
We need to do an echocardiogram
to make sure your heart

95
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,691
wasn't damaged in the crisis.

96
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,759
Fine by me.

97
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:57,289
Here's 10 percent
discount on any purchase

98
00:04:57,364 --> 00:04:59,458
over $50 or more
at Z&B Naturals.

99
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:02,298
I'm Z, B is my partner Bill.

100
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:04,201
You're surrounded by
pot all day every day,

101
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:06,866
- but you never touch the stuff?
- How? Why?

102
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,203
Just never been my thing.

103
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:15,014
- The name always trips me up.
- Chlorthalidone.

104
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:16,910
That's for hypertension.

105
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,383
The bottle seems pretty full.
How long have you been on this?

106
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:22,514
About six months. Just
refilled it, take it every day.

107
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,097
Smile, head tilt.

108
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,595
Now he smiles...

109
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,333
burst of laughter...

110
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:37,403
Okay.

111
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:41,501
Yeah. Okay.

112
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:50,145
Rio Gutiérrez, 29, pituitary
mass went from manageable

113
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:51,651
with meds to likely surgery.

114
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:55,814
So talking to the new
radiology resident?

115
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:59,621
I wanted Dr. D'Souza's opinion
on an intriguing set of scans.

116
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,218
She is very talented.

117
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:02,752
You're crushing on her.

118
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,491
No. I am not. I love Lea.

119
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,398
Those two things
aren't mutually exclusive.

120
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:14,133
Mr. Gutiérrez's blood
has high levels of prolactin.

121
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,971
Prolactin is produced
in the pituitary gland.

122
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,322
The tumor could be secreting it.

123
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,755
Or the tumor could be reacting
to the high levels of hormones

124
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,680
being produced
elsewhere in the body.

125
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:23,444
The patient is a
transgender man.

126
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,214
Do an ultrasound.

127
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:32,950
Advance the probe until
you see the cardiac chamber.

128
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:37,122
Maybe Zara has secondary
hypertension due to renal vascular disease.

129
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:40,964
She doesn't. Her creatinine is
1.2. Her GFR is in normal range.

130
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:43,162
Well, that would make it
unlikely, but not impossible.

131
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,348
It'd also explain why her
prescribed hypertension meds

132
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:46,372
weren't working,

133
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,718
and why she got better when
you gave her the ACE inhibitor.

134
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,734
Simpler explanation:
she's not taking her meds.

135
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,810
Valve looks normal.

136
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,813
Should I move on to
the two-chamber view?

137
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,904
Yeah.

138
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:56,882
We have no reason
to think that she's lying.

139
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:59,337
She seems to be telling
the truth about her pot usage:

140
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:01,582
no THC in her blood or urine.

141
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:03,851
She couldn't possibly be
lying about something else?

142
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:06,860
The left ventricle is
thickened, which is consistent

143
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,259
with untreated hypertension.

144
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,489
Heart rate is climbing.

145
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,534
Cardiac output is dropping...

146
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,093
- Stroke volume as well.
- She's in cardiogenic shock.

147
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:23,267
Would you mind if I did an
ultrasound on your abdomen?

148
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,178
For a brain tumor?

149
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:28,238
This is my fiancé, Eli Simpson.

150
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:31,714
When I heard about the new
scans, I kind of stormed the castle.

151
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:33,509
My hero.

152
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,266
Your prolactin levels are very high,
which might be caused by the tumor,

153
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,191
unless another condition
raised your prolactin,

154
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:40,852
encouraging more growth.

155
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,362
What condition boosts prolactin?

156
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:46,156
Do you think I'm pregnant?

157
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:49,469
He can't be. He's
on testosterone.

158
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:51,867
Except for a few
weeks last month.

159
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:54,032
I forgot to take my
shot before our trip.

160
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:57,471
- But there's no way that...
- You're pregnant.

161
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:12,885
You went into cardiogenic shock

162
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,723
because your heart
wasn't pumping adequately.

163
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:18,287
We did a minor procedure
and installed an Impella pump,

164
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:20,197
but it's a short-term solution.

165
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,894
I do feel a little
out of breath.

166
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:24,028
But that might be just
because of you, Dr. Andrews.

167
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:26,838
Ms. Norton, I'm a married
man. And your doctor.

168
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:31,440
You have a rare condition.
Certain parts of your heart muscle

169
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,503
have become abnormally thick.

170
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:37,073
So, this wall in between the
chambers, that's the septum.

171
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,482
That's a normal one.

172
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:41,546
This is what yours looks like.

173
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,183
Wow.

174
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:44,849
It's gonna require surgery.

175
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:47,826
We're gonna run a few more tests
to determine the best approach.

176
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,924
What? You going to be
my surgeon, Dr. Andrews?

177
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,295
I sure will.

178
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:55,099
And y'all two gonna be with him?

179
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:56,295
Yeah.

180
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,832
My lucky day.

181
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:01,306
Three doctors of
color taking care of me.

182
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,939
Doctors who won't
talk down to me.

183
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,469
Not exactly what I'm used to.
You guys know what I mean.

184
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:11,245
My mother made me wear a suit and
tie whenever we went to the pediatrician.

185
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:14,918
Put on your Sunday best just to
get on a scale and touch your toes.

186
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:15,853
Yeah.

187
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:18,357
Made me so mad I wound
up becoming a doctor.

188
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:22,157
The testing confirmed

189
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:25,426
your tumor is a
hormone-producing prolactinoma.

190
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:28,161
And the pregnancy is
about six weeks along.

191
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,362
Do you consider yourself gay?

192
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:33,630
- I don't think that's...
- Yes.

193
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:36,309
Because I am gay.

194
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:39,471
But you have vaginal
intercourse with your fiancé.

195
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:41,981
- That is how he got pregnant...
- Dr. Murphy, that's enough.

196
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,209
Yeah. I... I'm just...

197
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:45,003
- I think you should leave.
- I just want...

198
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:57,589
I'm sorry. That was
completely inappropriate.

199
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:00,533
Our treatment
plan for your tumor

200
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,899
depends on your plan
for your pregnancy.

201
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:04,636
So...

202
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:10,640
We've talked about kids,

203
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:13,947
but I always figured that
was way down the road.

204
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:16,906
And not this way.

205
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:19,110
I always assumed we'd adopt.

206
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:24,451
I'd have to go
off T, and stay off.

207
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,254
If Rio doesn't
continue the pregnancy,

208
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,328
then what happens?

209
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:32,058
Your hormone levels
would drop quickly,

210
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,896
which would cause
the tumor to shrink.

211
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:37,529
After that, we'd use medication,
possibly a minor surgery.

212
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:42,265
I'd like to terminate
the pregnancy.

213
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:47,774
I looked over all Zara's
labs. All signs point

214
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:50,646
to her taking her hypertension
medicine regularly.

215
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:55,052
Her MRIs show significant
ventricular septal thickness,

216
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,851
bad turbulence jet flow.

217
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:59,949
There's myocardial edema too.

218
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:03,160
ACE inhibitors were a bad call.

219
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:06,427
Well, it's eventually sent our
patient into cardiogenic shock.

220
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,967
Why did you ignore
what she was telling us?

221
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,942
I made a medical
diagnosis based on...

222
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,877
pattern processing that
we're taught in med school,

223
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:25,146
which involves considering, you
know, race, education, occupation, BMI.

224
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,812
Always sounded
like profiling to me.

225
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:36,494
<i>California, San Jose,
specifically. Yes, we have the rain.</i>

226
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:38,589
<i>But more impressively, the wind.</i>

227
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:40,429
<i>That rain's gonna be
coming in sideways.</i>

228
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,969
<i>Just take a look at
how the wind increases</i>

229
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,938
<i>as we progress throughout the day.
So this afternoon, we're talking about</i>

230
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:47,701
<i>50 mile per hour
gusts possible...</i>

231
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:49,333
Sorry for crashing.

232
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:51,105
Radiology doesn't have a TV.

233
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,712
You like The Weather Channel?

234
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:58,251
I find it soothing.

235
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:01,614
Would you like to join me?

236
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:03,247
<i>Now you got the wind picking up.</i>

237
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:05,918
<i>Now you have your more
intense rainfall coming through.</i>

238
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:08,359
<i>And that's gonna also
lead to some flood potential</i>

239
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:10,363
<i>because all of us are
gonna get into the action.</i>

240
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,728
<i>You got the mountains...</i>

241
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:14,791
Would you mind if I lowered
the volume by four output levels?

242
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,130
<i>A flood potential.</i>

243
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:17,295
Oh.

244
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:19,437
That would be perfect.

245
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,804
<i>All the areas around here in
northern California, Modesto,</i>

246
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,240
<i>Stockton, Sacramento...</i>

247
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,915
I find the reflection on
the screen so distracting.

248
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,255
So do I.

249
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:54,468
Could I...

250
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:58,141
do this?

251
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:43,813
Nurse paged me.

252
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,119
Is something wrong?

253
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:50,028
I've changed my mind.

254
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,495
I want to keep the baby.

255
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:00,932
Since you're continuing
the pregnancy,

256
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,533
we'll need to surgically
remove the prolactinoma.

257
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,906
So you'll cut into his brain?

258
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:09,547
Our safest option is to go
in through the nasal cavity

259
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:12,779
in what's known as a transsphenoidal
surgery, T.S.S. for short.

260
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:16,550
It's less invasive
than our other option.

261
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,784
That still sounds dangerous.

262
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,121
I've made up my mind.

263
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,684
Do I get any say in this?

264
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,361
I'm all for us having a
family, but I'm not ready to...

265
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:28,799
No one's ever ready for kids.

266
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,838
Yesterday, you said that you'd
never considered getting pregnant,

267
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:34,271
and now you're willing
to risk your life for it.

268
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,210
When I was about 7,

269
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:43,012
I had this one refuge.

270
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,318
I'd hang a quilt
over a couple chairs

271
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:50,448
and hide out with my two buds...

272
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:53,552
Foxie the Fox and Fuzz the Lion.

273
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:57,797
And I'd imagine I was the dad...

274
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,866
and they were
my twin little guys.

275
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,168
Fraternal, obviously.

276
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,374
We were a family.

277
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:15,272
When I transitioned, I
put that dream aside,

278
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:18,247
at least as far as
them coming from me.

279
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:19,444
But now...

280
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:27,292
Whether we planned it
or not, this is our baby.

281
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:35,625
How soon can you do the surgery?

282
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:37,932
I'll order an image-guidance
MRI to get things started.

283
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:50,545
Based on the cardiac
MRI and catheterization,

284
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,051
there are two treatment
options: myectomy,

285
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,712
basically open heart surgery,

286
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,052
and alcohol septal ablation,

287
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,786
where we use the alcohol
to kill targeted sections

288
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:01,555
of the heart muscle.

289
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,095
But what would you recommend?

290
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:07,157
The surgery is more
invasive, tougher recovery,

291
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:09,202
but better efficacy long-term.

292
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:13,035
The ablation is less
dangerous, but you're more likely

293
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:15,472
to need further
medical interventions.

294
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,305
Now you call that
a recommendation?

295
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,538
There are pros and cons to both.

296
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:22,605
But you'll need to weigh
them. I'll give you some time.

297
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,077
You always want to take
care of people, Dr. Browne?

298
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,152
Pretty much.

299
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,448
Me too.

300
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,625
You run a marijuana dispensary.

301
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:35,093
It's not all about
getting people high.

302
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:38,427
No. Maybe not, but I'm
guessing most of your clientele...

303
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,831
My great Aunt Lucy
had pancreatic cancer.

304
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:44,534
A year, she hung on.

305
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,832
In agony.

306
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:51,336
Marijuana was the only thing
that helped her eat or sleep.

307
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:54,045
Doctors didn't give her
anything for the pain?

308
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,381
They suggested ibuprofen.

309
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:59,082
Now, you know
doctors are 22 percent

310
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:02,451
less likely to give pain meds to
Black patients than white patients

311
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,354
with the same symptoms.

312
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:08,918
My point is, you and
I, we're a lot alike.

313
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:12,259
We're both strong, Black women
finding our way in the world.

314
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:15,233
But one of us knows more
about medicine than the other.

315
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:16,301
So,

316
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:19,702
I'd like to know: what
would you do in my situation?

317
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:29,077
The open myectomy is a bigger
risk, but offers more long-term benefits.

318
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:32,875
I made my decision.

319
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,114
I'm with you, Dr. Browne.

320
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,355
Book the myectomy.

321
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:50,065
Here's the Rio Gutiérrez
imaging for your upcoming T.S.S.

322
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:52,071
Set that on the table, please.

323
00:17:55,942 --> 00:18:01,176
I, um... I noted the tumor's suprasellar
expansion and surrounding edema

324
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,375
and its splaying of
the Circle of Willis.

325
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,350
That is very helpful.

326
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:09,787
Bye, Dr. Murphy.

327
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:14,420
You're safe, Shaun, she's gone.

328
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:16,086
Not really.

329
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:20,130
Dr. D'Souza is still in
my brain. I don't like it.

330
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,128
We kissed.

331
00:18:23,002 --> 00:18:24,163
- What?
- When?

332
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,296
I have so many
thoughts about her.

333
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:28,705
And I have so many
questions I want to ask Rio.

334
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,299
Wouldn't he get
more pleasure from...

335
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:33,346
Questions you're not supposed to ask.
The kiss, Shaun? When did you kiss?

336
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,506
Last night. In my dream.

337
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,247
If I can't ask questions,

338
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:40,911
how do I understand?

339
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:42,546
My... My brain...

340
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:45,820
My... My brain isn't
behaving the way I want it to.

341
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:47,120
How do I make it stop?

342
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,466
You're attracted to Dr. D'Souza.

343
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:55,501
Why does that bother you?

344
00:18:57,603 --> 00:19:02,337
When I was with Carly
and had feelings for Lea,

345
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:04,900
it meant I was
supposed to be with Lea.

346
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,674
What if this means I'm
supposed to be with Dr. D'Souza?

347
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:13,150
No. You've loved Lea for
years, this is just... attraction.

348
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,452
But shouldn't loving
Lea make it go away?

349
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:23,424
Relationships would be a
lot easier if it worked that way.

350
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,023
You're feeling guilty.

351
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:28,863
I say take Lea out for a nice
dinner, something special.

352
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:33,372
And tell her about my
crush. I need to let Lea know.

353
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:35,271
- No. Definitely not.
- No. You do not.

354
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,220
I wanna get your thoughts
on the suprasellar extension

355
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:39,284
of the tumor for this T...

356
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:42,144
You remember Sarah Pepper,
runs Nephrology at S.F. Regional?

357
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,182
Always wears a shawl?

358
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,084
So during a staff meeting
last week, she fell apart.

359
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:49,520
Screaming, crying, in front
of the whole department,

360
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:52,183
- totally nuts.
- Rough day at the office.

361
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:56,457
I wonder how you'd approach and
resect without getting a C.S.F. leak.

362
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:57,690
Yeah.

363
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,755
Place a lumbar drain,
then infuse saline

364
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:01,494
and do Valsalva maneuver.

365
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:02,432
Mm.

366
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:05,403
Apparently Pepper's
meltdown was so over the top,

367
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:07,702
the hospital forced
her to take a leave.

368
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:09,273
How long?

369
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:10,502
Unspecified.

370
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:12,743
She's always
been a little crazy.

371
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,273
Last I checked,
eccentric and emotional

372
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:18,545
didn't qualify as crazy.
Thanks for taking a look.

373
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,327
I read that cisgender people
often reduce transgender people

374
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,989
to their genitalia, and
that that is offensive.

375
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,123
Did I do that to you and Rio?

376
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:35,057
Yes.

377
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:37,863
I'm sorry.

378
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:43,100
Rio will be going
into surgery soon.

379
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:46,945
He's been asking for you.

380
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:48,776
You haven't been
answering your phone.

381
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:50,940
Thanks for letting me know.

382
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,688
He is very confusing to me too.

383
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:00,090
Rio has worked so hard.

384
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,822
He had a bilateral
subcutaneous mastectomy

385
00:21:02,895 --> 00:21:04,488
and takes hormone
replacement therapy,

386
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:09,558
but now he is choosing
the most female act.

387
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:14,464
It's not female
if Rio is doing it.

388
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:19,444
Yes.

389
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:25,510
And he must have dealt with a
lot of prejudice during his transition.

390
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:27,280
I dealt with prejudice.

391
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:29,447
My brother helped me.
Does he have a brother?

392
00:21:31,257 --> 00:21:32,953
His family doesn't talk to him.

393
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:41,690
And now Rio is
having brain surgery.

394
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:46,096
He is very brave.

395
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,630
You can stay here.

396
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:55,771
I have a patient, Zara Norton.

397
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,580
We, uh, we diagnosed
her with H.O.C.M.

398
00:21:58,651 --> 00:21:59,812
I saw the file.

399
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:04,916
Dr. Guerin expressed some concerns
about my initial handling of the case

400
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,151
in the E.R.

401
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:11,225
He thinks I stereotyped
her... based on her race.

402
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:13,189
Do you think you did?

403
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,269
She was crashing,
I had to make a call.

404
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,998
I didn't have a lot to go on.

405
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,172
Glassman came to
see me this morning.

406
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,535
Someone told him I'm
unstable and need help.

407
00:22:26,612 --> 00:22:28,103
Any idea where he heard that?

408
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,048
I asked for help, you can too.

409
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:34,052
You're a resident, no
one cares if you need help.

410
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:38,549
I got this job in part
because my main competition,

411
00:22:38,624 --> 00:22:40,490
a man, backed me.

412
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,118
The second anyone thinks

413
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,272
- I can't handle this...
- No one is gonna think that.

414
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:46,096
They will if you keep
telling them I'm a mess.

415
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:50,060
You have P.T.S.D. You
shouldn't be ashamed.

416
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:53,503
Says the woman who just
profiled a Black female patient.

417
00:22:56,008 --> 00:22:57,567
You judged her...

418
00:22:57,643 --> 00:23:01,375
just like people will judge me
and whisper that I've always been

419
00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:04,440
a little intense, so no wonder
I was asked to step down.

420
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:06,651
Um...

421
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:10,417
Nobody needs to know.

422
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:14,287
Exactly.

423
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:20,497
You tell me that it doesn't matter,
you tell me everyone will understand,

424
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,797
and then you tell me
to keep it to myself.

425
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:25,167
Should I be ashamed
or shouldn't I be?

426
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:29,437
All right, Ms. Norton,
time to head to pre-op.

427
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:36,911
What's in the bag, handsome? I
like to know what goes into my body.

428
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:38,974
Cefazolin. It's a
prophylactic antibiotic

429
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:41,282
- we give before surgeries.
- Makes sense.

430
00:23:42,955 --> 00:23:46,187
Hey, what was the meds y'all gave
me when I first got here to the E.R.?

431
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:49,327
Enalaprilat. It's
an ACE inhibitor.

432
00:23:49,395 --> 00:23:51,626
- Isn't that for hypertension?
- Mm-hm.

433
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:56,119
But I thought I already told you I
was on meds for my blood pressure.

434
00:23:57,236 --> 00:23:58,363
You did.

435
00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,996
So you figured I needed more?

436
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:05,139
Or did you not believe me?

437
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:20,052
I'm sorry.

438
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:25,254
You must be scared.

439
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:28,100
You shouldn't have
to be scared alone.

440
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:31,502
I love you.

441
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,471
I love you too.

442
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,536
Eli...

443
00:24:41,747 --> 00:24:42,942
I can't see you.

444
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:45,108
I'm right here, babe.

445
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:47,847
Can you follow
this with your eyes?

446
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:52,024
It keeps disappearing.

447
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:53,423
You've lost peripheral vision.

448
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,427
The tumor is impinging
on the optic fibers.

449
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,326
We can't perform
the T.S.S. surgery.

450
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:05,396
With the tumor's
continued growth,

451
00:25:05,471 --> 00:25:06,769
the best remaining option

452
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:10,435
is the open pterional
craniotomy, but it is higher risk,

453
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,000
with a lengthier recovery,

454
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:14,570
all of which is on
top of the potential

455
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:17,013
for gender dysphoria
during pregnancy.

456
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:19,176
Is that still a concern?

457
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:23,049
I think back to before
I started taking T,

458
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,582
how terrible that felt.

459
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:30,355
The thought of feeling
that all over again...

460
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:37,034
We could go back
to the original plan.

461
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:40,563
You mean terminate
the pregnancy?

462
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,036
The tumor should
shrink on its own.

463
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,907
After everything you've done
to get where you are in your life,

464
00:25:51,517 --> 00:25:53,383
it's scary to think
about doing something

465
00:25:53,452 --> 00:25:54,920
that would put that at risk.

466
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,818
This is my next step.

467
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,958
I'm ready to take
it, even if I'm scared.

468
00:26:07,466 --> 00:26:10,334
You have to take risks
sometimes, Dr. Lim.

469
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:20,437
Here.

470
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,545
Shouldn't you be
prepping Zara for surgery?

471
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:24,615
It's canceled.

472
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:26,914
She wants to be transferred
to a different hospital.

473
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:32,456
One where she won't be
"racially profiled into heart failure."

474
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:43,595
Shaun... you okay?

475
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:49,039
I'm having thoughts
I don't want to have.

476
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:52,135
Both Park and Jordan
say I shouldn't tell you.

477
00:26:53,245 --> 00:26:55,009
But you're going to, aren't you?

478
00:26:57,149 --> 00:27:00,551
Yes, I am. I have a work crush.

479
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,918
Also, my patient is a
pregnant trans man...

480
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:07,187
Wait. One at a time,
Shaun. About this... crush?

481
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:09,193
Her name is Dr. Cintia D'Souza.

482
00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:11,196
She is a second-year
radiology resident.

483
00:27:11,263 --> 00:27:13,425
Last night, I dreamed we
were in the Residents' Lounge,

484
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:15,810
watching The Weather Channel
and then we started kissing...

485
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:17,029
Okay, I got it.

486
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:20,130
Are you mad?

487
00:27:20,706 --> 00:27:23,198
Park and Jordan were right,
I shouldn't have told you.

488
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:26,101
No, I'm not mad.

489
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:29,546
A little surprised,
but that's okay.

490
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:36,614
I'm still attracted to
other guys sometimes.

491
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:40,486
No. No. What? Who?

492
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:41,959
- It doesn't matter.
- Who?

493
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:47,192
The... Okay, there's this
one physical therapist...

494
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:49,861
No. No.

495
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:50,935
No.

496
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:56,034
What if...

497
00:27:56,808 --> 00:28:00,609
we're attracted to other people
because there's something wrong

498
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,147
with our relationship?

499
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:07,149
You're not planning on
kissing Dr. D'Souza in real life?

500
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:08,118
No.

501
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:10,247
Or working late with her?

502
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:12,951
Doing some x-rays alone,

503
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:15,790
where you might end up
leaning over the same lightbox...

504
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:18,660
We don't use lightboxes anymore.

505
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:25,300
And I don't plan to
work late with her.

506
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,772
Then I don't think either of us
has anything to be worried about.

507
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:43,487
I have to go prep for
a pterional craniotomy.

508
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:52,921
I'm Dr. Glassman, the
president of the hospital.

509
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:55,793
Unless you're here to
drive me to S.F. Regional,

510
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:57,426
you can head right back on out.

511
00:28:58,637 --> 00:29:02,199
I apologize for your experience
in the emergency room.

512
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:04,038
That's mighty white of you.

513
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:10,172
I don't recommend that
you transfer to S.F. Regional,

514
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:12,049
or any other nearby
hospital, for that matter.

515
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:14,280
I'm sure they got the
same fancy equipment,

516
00:29:14,353 --> 00:29:16,584
same shiny sets of
diplomas y'all got here,

517
00:29:16,655 --> 00:29:19,090
and maybe a few
less racist doctors.

518
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:22,751
Well, apparently, that
doesn't seem to be the case.

519
00:29:23,395 --> 00:29:27,765
I pulled data on comparable
hospitals within 100 miles,

520
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:33,329
did numbers on surgical
outcomes, and patient satisfaction,

521
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:34,930
aggregated by race.

522
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:40,041
Apparently, we're doing
well, comparatively.

523
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:46,412
Your argument is that your
hospital may be racially biased,

524
00:29:46,485 --> 00:29:49,114
but it's less racially biased
than these other hospitals?

525
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,356
Yeah, pretty much.

526
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:56,852
Stay at St. Bonaventure,
the president of the hospital

527
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:59,329
will monitor your care
every step of the way.

528
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:02,157
For whatever it's worth...

529
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:05,363
I don't think you can
do better than that.

530
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:17,341
She's gonna stay
on one condition:

531
00:30:18,884 --> 00:30:20,352
that you're off the team.

532
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:33,527
Dr. Park, please
open sylvian fissure.

533
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:35,533
Arachnoid knife and
Rhoton dissector.

534
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:39,836
The tumor is visible.

535
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:42,731
What makes someone a man?

536
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:47,272
I thought it was just
the chromosomes,

537
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:51,283
but that must not be it,
which makes things confusing

538
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,842
and difficult, and I know Rio
was uncomfortable when...

539
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,512
Life is uncomfortable.

540
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:59,454
It hits you with tough situations
and you muscle through them.

541
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,459
I see a tiny bleed
in the circular sinus.

542
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,119
Pack it with Floseal.

543
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:11,428
Someone give me an update.

544
00:31:11,503 --> 00:31:13,335
We got a drop in end-tidal
CO2 and oxygen sat.

545
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:15,931
See any evidence
of exposed air cells?

546
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:19,000
No, but waxing bone
edges just to be safe.

547
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:22,570
But the tumor thinned the
sellar floor and sphenoid wall.

548
00:31:23,148 --> 00:31:25,174
Making it permeable to oxygen.

549
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:27,918
It's an air embolism.

550
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:30,822
BP is dropping.

551
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,023
Dr. Lim? What should we do?

552
00:31:42,768 --> 00:31:43,861
Dr. Lim?

553
00:31:58,283 --> 00:31:59,751
Saline gauze.

554
00:31:59,818 --> 00:32:02,287
Tip the table to eliminate the
negative air pressure gradient,

555
00:32:02,354 --> 00:32:03,617
and place a central line.

556
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:07,752
This'll stop the air leak and
allow us to access the air bubble.

557
00:32:07,826 --> 00:32:10,318
Inserting a Bunegin
air-aspiration cath.

558
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:15,830
You are two centimeters
from the superior vena cava.

559
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:19,694
Aspirate the right atrium until
you don't see any more air bubbles.

560
00:32:30,215 --> 00:32:31,444
Nice save, Dr. Lim.

561
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,442
Let's get this tumor out.

562
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:38,286
Make your transverse aortotomy
with Potts scissors, Dr. Wolke.

563
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:42,620
Extending the muscular
incision down to the mid-ventricle.

564
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:44,862
There's the myectomy site.

565
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:48,459
There is the aberrant
muscle bundle.

566
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:14,121
Take her off bypass.

567
00:33:14,793 --> 00:33:15,954
See how she does.

568
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:30,465
How's the cardiac output?

569
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,508
Reduced and insufficient.

570
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:38,177
Low output could mean we
need to further reduce the septum.

571
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,961
Unless it means that
we reduced it too much.

572
00:33:39,985 --> 00:33:42,955
Damaged the cardiac electrical
conductors that control the heart rate.

573
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,649
She's having
third-degree heart block.

574
00:33:44,723 --> 00:33:48,057
Enrique's right. We
took too much muscle.

575
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,940
Put her back on bypass.

576
00:33:49,995 --> 00:33:52,521
We could augment the
wall with a bovine patch.

577
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:54,197
Wouldn't insulate
the electrical system.

578
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:57,327
She'd still be at risk of complete
heart block and cardiac arrest.

579
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:03,532
We could insert a
dual-chamber pacer.

580
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:05,987
She won't need the conduction
system in the wall of her heart

581
00:34:06,011 --> 00:34:07,707
to control her heart rate.

582
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:10,808
Let's go!

583
00:34:16,688 --> 00:34:18,247
How was the craniotomy?

584
00:34:18,323 --> 00:34:21,191
It went well, the
patient is in recovery.

585
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:26,958
Your text said you
have good news.

586
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:29,331
And by good news, I mean
bad news for Dr. D'Souza.

587
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:32,565
Plenty of great stuff
to crush a crush.

588
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:34,196
First observation,

589
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:37,041
she smells like cinnamon.

590
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:39,472
Hmm.

591
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:43,376
Which is more
puzzling than irritating.

592
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:45,917
Actually, kind of nice,
which is obviously not helpful.

593
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:49,554
Oh. Okay, she does this
weird self-grooming gesture,

594
00:34:49,621 --> 00:34:52,056
where she tucks her
hair behind her ear...

595
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:55,484
and then sort of
massages her ear?

596
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:58,021
Also not helpful.

597
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,792
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

598
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:01,298
Mm-hm.

599
00:35:01,366 --> 00:35:05,235
Okay. At the salad bar,
she used the cucumber tongs

600
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:06,965
to reach for the cucumbers...

601
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,434
and then the tomatoes...

602
00:35:12,644 --> 00:35:13,976
and the olives...

603
00:35:16,381 --> 00:35:18,111
and the pickles.

604
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:20,976
- Ugh.
- Mm.

605
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:22,610
Mm-hm.

606
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:55,786
Hey.

607
00:35:57,789 --> 00:35:58,848
Hey.

608
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,722
I can see all of you.

609
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:10,028
- How...? How'd we do?
- Great.

610
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:13,134
We got all of the
mass, vision is restored.

611
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:16,231
You have every reason
to expect a full recovery,

612
00:36:17,142 --> 00:36:18,872
and a healthy pregnancy.

613
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:23,444
We're gonna be dads.

614
00:36:27,052 --> 00:36:28,213
Are you ready?

615
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:32,984
I've never been a
pregnant man before.

616
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:38,262
You'll always be the best
man that I've ever known.

617
00:36:51,843 --> 00:36:53,709
I came to see how you're doing.

618
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,340
Dr. Andrews told me you
was the one who figured out

619
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:57,609
how to save me.

620
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:04,688
Still don't change what
went down earlier though.

621
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:12,764
When I got to med school...

622
00:37:16,201 --> 00:37:17,241
people took one look at me

623
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:19,294
and thought they
knew exactly who I was.

624
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:22,203
Black girl on financial aid...

625
00:37:24,209 --> 00:37:25,802
She must not be that smart,

626
00:37:25,877 --> 00:37:28,540
she must have
gotten a lot of breaks...

627
00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:31,506
she'll probably need a lot more.

628
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:37,719
And I worked...

629
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:43,159
I worked so hard to
prove them wrong,

630
00:37:44,062 --> 00:37:47,089
that I wasn't who they thought I
was, that I deserved to be there,

631
00:37:47,165 --> 00:37:49,725
that I... I fit in.

632
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,572
When you came into the E.R...

633
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:02,607
loud and messy...

634
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,144
I saw...

635
00:38:06,985 --> 00:38:09,477
I saw everything
I have tried hard...

636
00:38:10,922 --> 00:38:12,083
not to be.

637
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,995
I don't know, I think
it made me angry.

638
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:25,632
And I'm ashamed of that.

639
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:30,007
And I'm really sorry.

640
00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:35,512
I used to be that way.

641
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:42,147
But I got tired of working that hard
to make white people comfortable.

642
00:38:58,102 --> 00:38:59,798
You two heading
out for the night?

643
00:39:03,141 --> 00:39:04,200
We sure are.

644
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:06,710
How did the
craniotomy go, Shaun?

645
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:10,371
Did you guys get all
of the prolactinoma?

646
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:12,382
Yes.

647
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:15,545
Is that cafeteria salad?

648
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:19,047
Are there pickles in there?

649
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,192
Did you want some?

650
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:26,493
You know, I'm good,
thank you. Shaun, do you...?

651
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,262
- No, thank you.
- Mm-hm.

652
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:37,603
It does help to focus on her
irresponsible salad-bar practices

653
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:39,109
and dietary preferences.

654
00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:42,147
I've got a ton of strategies
to manage discomfort.

655
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:44,045
So do I.

656
00:39:47,252 --> 00:39:48,252
- Hey.
- Hey.

657
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:53,149
To replenish your supply
and a peace offering.

658
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,921
I wasn't aware we were at war.

659
00:39:56,794 --> 00:40:00,595
Well, it seemed like my gossip
about Pepper kind of landed wrong.

660
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:03,133
Bad day.

661
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:04,832
Sorry to crash the party.

662
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:08,169
Dr. Glassman wanted
me to show this to you two.

663
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,371
I asked Lea to run some
numbers on various metrics by race

664
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:16,312
and the results are not
great, especially when it comes

665
00:40:16,381 --> 00:40:17,474
to pain management.

666
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:21,212
We are under-treating
African-American and Latinx patients

667
00:40:21,286 --> 00:40:23,221
by a considerable margin.

668
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:25,722
I think I need a little
of that peace offering.

669
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:26,790
Help yourself.

670
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,124
- Anyone else?
- No, thank you.

671
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,096
Me neither.

672
00:40:43,508 --> 00:40:45,272
Started taking Sertraline.

673
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:48,142
For P.T.S.D.

674
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:52,113
Sorry to hear that.

675
00:40:53,985 --> 00:40:55,283
You doing okay?

676
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,515
Not really.

677
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:04,660
But I'm working on it.

678
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:06,863
Okay.

679
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:13,362
Dr. Browne, good work.

680
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,738
Thank you.

681
00:41:43,768 --> 00:41:45,396
I apologized to Zara.

682
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:52,637
She pointed out I
spent med school...

683
00:41:53,778 --> 00:41:56,213
trying to make white
people comfortable.

684
00:42:00,151 --> 00:42:01,278
I mean, she's right.

685
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,186
It wasn't just med school.

686
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:08,082
Exhausting, isn't it?

687
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,592
But we had to do it, right?

688
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:15,059
To be here?
