1
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:04,433
You should be getting a raise.

2
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:06,997
You don't get a raise every
time you do something well.

3
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:10,943
You did something very well
and saved 1.75 million dollars.

4
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:14,072
- I'll talk to Dr. Glassman about it.
- No, you won't.

5
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:16,309
If any talking, or anything
else needs to be done,

6
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:18,477
I'm fully capable of
handling that my...

7
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:22,216
Hey! No, no, no...

8
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:26,351
- Hey! Hey, that's my car!
- You can pick it up at Tricky's Towing.

9
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:28,588
I'm picking it up right
now because this is my car,

10
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:30,893
I'm allowed to park here,
and you're a trespasser.

11
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:34,834
- Any time after 1.
- Shaun, tell him.

12
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:35,926
Mm...

13
00:00:36,003 --> 00:00:38,563
This is not your spot.

14
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:39,639
Oh-ho!

15
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:40,901
Someone told a lie.

16
00:00:42,843 --> 00:00:46,803
I just got a spot last week,
so it's kind of new to everyone.

17
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,612
So, yes, it is not my spot, but
that doesn't make it the wrong spot.

18
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:54,050
It'll be 250, cash or credit.

19
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:56,352
I'm not paying 250, I don't
have 250 to waste on th...

20
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:57,783
- If you get that raise...
- Shaun!

21
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,190
Would you just
stop for a minute?

22
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,525
- Not once I start.
- That's not a law,

23
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:04,622
that's just some bull
you bastards made up.

24
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:06,291
Three-fifty.

25
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:07,857
Hostile work environment fee.

26
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:21,144
Jeffrey Williams, 21 years old.

27
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:23,774
When he was 5, he
fell in love with baseball.

28
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,580
Dreamt of playing
with the Tigers.

29
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:27,018
By the time he was 8,

30
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,784
he was the best hitter in
Little League. Right, Jeff?

31
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,084
At 9, he led his team all
the way to the Divisionals.

32
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,307
<i>Pura vida,</i> Dannie.

33
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:49,827
- Retropulsion.
- What?

34
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,470
Her thumb moved.

35
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:56,869
- What does that mean?
- Nothing.

36
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:59,606
If it happened, it's a normal
response in dying muscles.

37
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,082
Or it could just be the result of
hypoxia or an electrolyte imbalance.

38
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:06,511
Or brain activity.

39
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:11,190
The E.E.G. showed no
purposeful brain activity.

40
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:12,487
Hook her back up.

41
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:16,018
Elias, over the last ten years,
Dannie's had thousands of tests.

42
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,759
- If there was any chance...
- Dr. Reznick, please. Now!

43
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:37,641
Ankylosing spondylitis.
Nasty little disease.

44
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:40,017
When Jeff was 10, the
inflammation was so bad,

45
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:42,818
the bones in his back
started to fuse together

46
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,825
into one big gnarly bone.

47
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,191
If you can't extend your
back, you can't use your legs.

48
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:51,163
If you can't unwind your
back, you can't use your arms.

49
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,929
Useless legs. Useless arms. Can't
even fit into a standard wheelchair.

50
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,232
I've had breakfast
in bed since I was 10.

51
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,237
And lunch and dinner.

52
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:02,501
Are you in a lot of pain?

53
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,768
Not compared to what it was.

54
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:07,542
I wish I'd met that rheumatologist
at the Baltimore Spine Clinic

55
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:09,412
seven years earlier.

56
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:10,644
They didn't offer surgery?

57
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:12,481
I've... I've been to
nine neurosurgeons

58
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:15,454
and they all said that
they couldn't fix me. So...

59
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:21,790
But thanks to Dr. Glassman, my
post-pretzel future is looking bright.

60
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:29,229
I want to move out of long-term
care, want to study engineering...

61
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,465
go to Europe.

62
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,574
Hell, go to a ballpark
and see the game.

63
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,403
Maybe with a girl.

64
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,584
I'd just love to be able
to hug somebody again.

65
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:52,754
I'm going to need two
residents to assist me with...

66
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,460
with the surgery.

67
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,368
What were you
doing ten years ago?

68
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:06,537
That's how long it's been since
the aneurysm in her brain ruptured.

69
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:09,906
And how long Elias has been
visiting, bringing her Peppermint Patties

70
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,571
and hoping for that special day
she opens her eyes and says,

71
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,114
"Hi, honey, did I sleep in?"

72
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:16,514
And I had finally gotten
him to give that up.

73
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:17,607
Give up hope?

74
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:20,813
Give up an impossible fantasy
that has paralyzed his life.

75
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:23,914
He used to have a
career, goals, a wife,

76
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,016
things he can have again
if we let him move on.

77
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:27,526
And by "we," I mean you.

78
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,020
You're going to tell him
the twitch meant nothing.

79
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:32,258
But she has elevated
levels of dopamine.

80
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,459
Which is a stress hormone,

81
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,866
likely produced by the
adrenal when it was shut down.

82
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,837
But it's also a
neurotransmitter in the brain

83
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:43,274
and may be associated
with increased brain activity.

84
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,141
We need to do a
SPECT C.T. of her brain

85
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:48,376
and full-body with radiotracers
to find the source of the dopamine.

86
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:50,912
You know about Elias, right?

87
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:54,045
The patient's husband who can't move
on and it's making everything worse?

88
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,213
Do you see an analogy here?

89
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,492
- No.
- No more tests, Shaun.

90
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,188
I'll ask Dr. Lim.

91
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:05,158
- I'm calling your bluff.
- I don't know how to bluff.

92
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:16,332
Your joint cuts
are nearly perfect.

93
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:20,169
"Nearly perfect" leaves him
with no feeling in his legs.

94
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,209
I kind of cracked
the vertebral body.

95
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:28,085
But I got the rest right.

96
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,266
That is perfect.
Welcome to my team.

97
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:49,334
Textbook.

98
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,605
You followed the video
demonstration exactly.

99
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,820
You didn't.

100
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:05,220
The third bone is the problem,

101
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:08,091
and you messed around
with the first one. Why?

102
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,865
My model was a bit more
severe than the one in the demo.

103
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:15,892
So I thought a three-column
reconstruction might be better.

104
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:22,142
Nice. Nice improv.
You're on my team.

105
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,958
I mapped out every screw placement,
osteotomy cut, and rod contouring.

106
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:51,896
Now, I've been... trying to
figure out why you're doing this.

107
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:55,932
I don't know. Change a
kid's life? Something like that.

108
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:58,606
I'm thinking you must be afraid.

109
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,375
- What?
- Come on.

110
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:04,475
You've been impulsive ever
since you recovered from cancer.

111
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,881
You quit surgery
to start a clinic,

112
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,218
married my favorite
barista after a few dates,

113
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:11,349
and I'm guessing none
of it made you happy.

114
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,585
I'm sorry.

115
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:15,254
We barely talk to each other
outside of the board meetings

116
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,763
and now all of a sudden
you can see into my soul?

117
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:20,357
I love my wife, I love my work.

118
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:21,433
Great.

119
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,997
And you still feel
empty, don't you?

120
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:27,700
I'm thinking you're scared
something's missing from your life,

121
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:28,798
so you keep reaching.

122
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,674
You take on a case no
other surgeon will touch.

123
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,073
As fascinating as all this is,

124
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:39,346
I don't think Jeffrey cares all that
much why we're doing the surgery.

125
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,419
He should.

126
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:44,322
Because your motives are affecting
your ability to properly assess

127
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:47,020
whether that surgery
is worth the risk.

128
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:56,893
Thank you for the input.

129
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:10,382
You were supposed to meet
me for lunch at 12:15. It's 12:23.

130
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,442
I'm not the first person
Tricky has shafted,

131
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,748
he's earned his name.

132
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,755
I'm gathering every
complaint I can find,

133
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:19,884
which I wouldn't be doing if
you'd back me up. So, no lunch.

134
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,921
Are you mad at me?

135
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:26,057
When you're mad at
me, you don't look at me.

136
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,567
Although, you are now,
so maybe you're not.

137
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:32,538
I turned to my boyfriend for
support and he hung me out to dry,

138
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,471
so let's just say I
am disappointed.

139
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,305
I told the truth.

140
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:38,845
This isn't about honesty,
this is about having my back.

141
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:42,639
We're a team now, Shaun,
working together for a common goal.

142
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:45,810
And right now, our goal
is to get my car back.

143
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:49,322
Then you need to pay $350.

144
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:52,621
I'm paying nothing. He is a pirate and
I'm going to expose him to the world.

145
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:06,097
No increased
dopamine-specific uptake.

146
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:07,538
It's not coming from the brain.

147
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,872
Which means it must've
come from the adrenal glands

148
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,707
when we shut down
their oxygen supply.

149
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,144
Move down to adrenals.

150
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:17,750
Impressive, to mourn
his wife for ten years.

151
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:20,878
He's not mourning her. He
can't as long as she's alive.

152
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:25,849
Dannie is stuck in limbo,
somewhere between life and death.

153
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:26,925
So is he.

154
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,362
If there are time limits
to being a good partner,

155
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,695
are there also ethical limits?

156
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:37,365
Should you support them even
if they've done something wrong?

157
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:39,633
You think maybe the
coma patient robbed a bank?

158
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,300
- Good alibi.
- What did Lea do?

159
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,571
Doesn't matter. Support her.

160
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,476
Whether you agree
with them or not,

161
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:48,708
the job of a good
partner is to be supportive.

162
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:54,514
As opposed to, say, resolving disputes
by running to the Chief of Surgery.

163
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:58,115
It's not coming from
the adrenals either.

164
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:06,262
There it is, but it's not
coming from an organ.

165
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,664
It's coming from a tumor.

166
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:12,636
Dannie has cancer.

167
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:21,178
We could say we're doing
a... kind of Humpty Dumpty,

168
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:24,581
only this time we're actually going
to put you back together again.

169
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:26,514
Don't get too excited though,

170
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:28,885
Dr. Andrews wants to
give us a little reality check.

171
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:31,088
If all goes well,

172
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:34,559
you'll have a restricted range of
motion, and be dependent on a walker.

173
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:39,132
If all doesn't go well,
there is a risk of paralysis,

174
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,395
and, given the potential
for massive blood loss,

175
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:45,598
there's a small chance you
might not survive the surgery.

176
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,936
But you have a great team

177
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:51,341
and one of the top
neurosurgeons in the world.

178
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,978
So, what do you say?

179
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:57,142
This is really happening.

180
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,049
Yes, sir. Tomorrow
morning. First thing.

181
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:10,361
I'm sorry, Dr. Glassman.

182
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:13,395
I can't... I can't do it.

183
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:26,768
She has a paraganglioma
abutting her vertebrae.

184
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:29,475
Her twitch wasn't a sign
of increased brain activity,

185
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:32,314
it was just a reaction to the
tumor irritating her nerves.

186
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,018
We can take her
off life support.

187
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,254
What about this
cancer? It's treatable?

188
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:44,957
The only treatment would be
surgery, and it's in a difficult location.

189
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:48,024
- But what happens if you don't remove it?
- It's malignant.

190
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,865
Dannie would die within
a couple of months.

191
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,701
- Then you have to operate.
- She could die in the O.R.

192
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,401
rather than here, with
you holding her hand.

193
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,477
We rechecked her
E.E.G. There's no change.

194
00:12:58,544 --> 00:12:59,544
There was a change.

195
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,515
No... The thumb
movement was a change.

196
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:04,642
And the cancer and the
dopamine were changes.

197
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:08,051
Something else could change
and maybe that will wake her up.

198
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:11,220
Elias, her body is dying.

199
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,691
Only if we let it.

200
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:17,987
I gave up on her once,
I'm not doing that again.

201
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:33,836
I've got your discharge
paperwork here.

202
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:38,012
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

203
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:42,479
I thought I was ready for this
and I knew it was dangerous.

204
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,793
Hey, look, my
life isn't perfect...

205
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:50,461
but it's not so bad that I
want to risk throwing it away.

206
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:03,633
You ever hear of Gates Brown?

207
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:08,404
- Left field for the '68 Tigers?
- Yes.

208
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:09,881
My dad had his baseball card.

209
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,610
Your dad ever tell
you about his story?

210
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:17,181
First person to recognize
his talent was a prison guard.

211
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,691
He helped him get out of
prison a year early on parole

212
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,695
so he could play
professional baseball.

213
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:28,627
I think about Gates Brown a lot.

214
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:33,764
Whenever I have to
make a tough, really...

215
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:35,841
tough decision,

216
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:37,774
I think about how scared
he must have been.

217
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:43,979
About playing for the Tigers?
It's a dream come true. Real scary.

218
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,541
Getting out of jail early.

219
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:49,383
Facing a world he
hadn't been in in a while.

220
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:52,015
What if he didn't live
up to expectations?

221
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:53,957
What if he wasn't good
enough for the bigs?

222
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:56,586
But he kept fighting.
He kept pushing.

223
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:00,194
You wanted to have this surgery.

224
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:02,836
And you kept fighting,
and you kept pushing.

225
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,030
And doctor after doctor said no.

226
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:08,040
And finally you found
a doctor who said yes.

227
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:09,200
And now you stop?

228
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,442
That doesn't make any sense.

229
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:15,348
I don't think that you are afraid
that the surgery is going to fail.

230
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,247
I think you're afraid
it's going to succeed.

231
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:21,984
For the last several years, you
could have taken classes online,

232
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,249
worked towards your degree.

233
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,567
- You could have traveled...
- You don't think I've tried?

234
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:29,892
No. You tried. Okay. And you failed.
But, man, did you have a good excuse.

235
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:35,293
And now, you have the surgery,
and it's successful, but you still fail?

236
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,331
That's scary.

237
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:41,306
Because now, you gotta
look at yourself in the mirror.

238
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:42,569
And you have to ask...

239
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:45,937
"Was it my condition?
Or was it me?"

240
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,582
You know where I
celebrated my 10th birthday?

241
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:55,954
Children's Hospital.

242
00:15:57,423 --> 00:16:00,757
Getting 13 steroid
shots into my spine.

243
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,696
By the time I was 11,
my entire social network

244
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:07,427
was R.N.s and M.D.s.

245
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,796
I've never had a job.

246
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:14,932
I've never danced with a girl.

247
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:21,378
I've never even
had a best friend.

248
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:28,651
I have no idea how to
live like a regular person.

249
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:33,692
So what?

250
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:38,254
So you'll suck at
it. Join the club.

251
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:47,503
Say no to the surgery if
that's the right decision.

252
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:48,768
But do yourself a favor.

253
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,174
Don't say no because
you're afraid to live your life.

254
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,855
I'm going to support you.

255
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:12,163
Thank you.

256
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:15,532
- I'm looking right at you, see?
- I noticed.

257
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,036
Let me have your phone.

258
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,100
Why?

259
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,973
I've created a couple
hundred Yelp accounts

260
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,104
to trash Tricky and maxed
out on my I.P. address,

261
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,670
so I need another one.

262
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,740
You're not allowed to do that.

263
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:35,379
He's not allowed to extort people.
So I'm just extorting him back.

264
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:41,323
Once I threaten to unleash my
arsenal, he'll hand over my car.

265
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:45,525
He might even detail it for me. I
won't have to actually post anything.

266
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:55,206
Thank you.

267
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:00,641
This last segment of tumor

268
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:02,909
is holding on to her
spinal dura for dear life.

269
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:04,143
Fine dissecting scissors.

270
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:10,285
I may be participating in fraud.

271
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:15,619
But I want to
support my partner.

272
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,023
If your partner wants
you to do something

273
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,363
that makes you feel
uncomfortable, shut it down.

274
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:22,629
Do not enable crazy.

275
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:24,466
Lea isn't crazy.

276
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:28,497
We're all crazy sometimes.
Just takes the right motivation.

277
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,306
There is an obvious
middle ground.

278
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:36,747
If your partner's doing something
wrong, help them see what's right.

279
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,315
Damn it, the capsule
ruptured and it tore the dura.

280
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:44,914
We have a C.S.F. leak.
We should try a graft.

281
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:46,789
Harvest some fascia
to reinforce the dura.

282
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:52,764
Dr. Lim...

283
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:19,624
Mm.

284
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,153
Tastes like my birthday.

285
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:29,962
Lab confirms the tumor wasn't
metastatic. You're cancer-free.

286
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,038
And brain function
is apparently fine.

287
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:38,672
All in all, it's been
a pretty good day.

288
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:43,848
Ten years.

289
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:50,148
I miss anything good?

290
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:54,592
No.

291
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:01,723
So why did I wake up?

292
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:04,567
We're running tests.

293
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,766
There have been cases of
anesthesia rebooting the dormant brain.

294
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:10,810
Yours was light, but
it still might have...

295
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,344
Let's just call it a miracle.

296
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:22,287
Last bone wedge.

297
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,413
Let's start
straightening him out.

298
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,574
You know, if you can talk
this kid into risking his life,

299
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:47,306
I'm thinking maybe you can
talk anyone out of any fear.

300
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:49,644
Been trying to talk you
out of those caps for years.

301
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:52,742
These caps save
lives. No fear in that.

302
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,454
I'm afraid to eat
a cheeseburger.

303
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:07,156
My mother, she was
very proud of her cooking,

304
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:11,068
and she told us we didn't need
to sacrifice taste to keep kosher.

305
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:13,163
At least not with
her in the kitchen.

306
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:15,071
And it's crazy, you know,

307
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:18,339
considering all the other ways
I've rejected her faith. But...

308
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,611
if I do eat one, it...

309
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:25,451
feels like I'm cutting my
last lifeline to my mother.

310
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,755
My mom taught me
how to play guitar.

311
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:37,089
We had our problems,
a lot of them, but...

312
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,925
everything seemed to be
okay when we were singing.

313
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:46,804
Since she died, I'm... I'm
afraid to even open the case.

314
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:58,880
It's the middle of your
shift. You miss me?

315
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:02,654
I had a bad morning.
My patient lived.

316
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:04,548
That is surprising.

317
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:06,922
You keep being competent,
you'll get used to it.

318
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,517
I need an ice cream infusion.

319
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:11,530
- The cafeteria has ice cream.
- Not Cherry Garcia.

320
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:13,698
Heard you lost out to a Firsty.

321
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:15,664
One bright spot in my day.

322
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:21,469
I did everything perfectly,
but it's still not symmetrical.

323
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:25,743
Nose job.

324
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:30,112
It's changing as you fix
it, you gotta change with it.

325
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,619
Andrews always said the first thing
you do with your plan is toss it out.

326
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:35,985
That's exactly why I
didn't do a plastics elective.

327
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:39,048
Or you're a blue-collar ex-cop
who's afraid to color outside the lines.

328
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:44,488
Your L3 vertebrae is perfect,

329
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:46,532
which means you're
not entirely without talent.

330
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:49,331
Look at the bones
you're not supposed to fix.

331
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:52,496
What are your instincts telling
you that this procedure manual isn't?

332
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:12,381
Huh.

333
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:15,257
Congratulations, you're
now as good as a Firsty.

334
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,694
I almost feel bad about
eating your ice cream.

335
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:28,172
BP's 82 over 50. Spinal shock?

336
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,731
SSEP and MEP waves are normal.

337
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:32,174
Check for buckling.

338
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:38,080
- No cord compression.
- Okay, pressure's still dropping.

339
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:40,779
Did we poke a hole in the canal?

340
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,087
Let's back out these screws.

341
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:50,557
Spine's not the problem, it's
his heart. It's in failure. Crash cart!

342
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,230
Sponges.

343
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:00,103
I know why Dannie woke up.

344
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,837
The paraganglioma
was filled with dopamine.

345
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:06,242
And leaking it in trace
amounts, that's how we found it.

346
00:24:06,312 --> 00:24:08,008
But when the capsule ruptured,

347
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,413
the tumor released the
dopamine in very large amounts.

348
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:14,146
Her spinal tap showed over
1200 nanograms per liter...

349
00:24:16,722 --> 00:24:21,285
which bathed her brain in dopamine,
which energized it and woke her up.

350
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:23,755
It was just a freak event.

351
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,435
A temporary freak event.

352
00:24:30,536 --> 00:24:33,404
The dopamine's going to wear off
and her brain will shut down again.

353
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,303
Yes.

354
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:37,309
And the dose she'd need
to stay awake would be toxic.

355
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:41,574
If we don't replicate the surge,
she'll relapse into a coma.

356
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:43,616
And if we do, she'll die.

357
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:56,861
Your dopamine levels are dropping
quickly, and when they return to normal,

358
00:24:57,563 --> 00:24:59,759
you'll return to your
comatose state.

359
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,029
- What?
- No.

360
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:05,135
She... Look at her. She's lucid.

361
00:25:06,138 --> 00:25:07,902
She's talking and
laughing, she's fine.

362
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:10,866
I'm sorry.

363
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:14,703
That's it? There's no treatment,
no surgery, no medication?

364
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,772
- Elias, I wish we...
- No!

365
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:24,349
How long do I have?

366
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:27,793
Less than 24 hours.

367
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:32,826
But she could wake
up again, right?

368
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:34,799
I mean, you didn't
think she would this time.

369
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:36,130
You said she shouldn't have.

370
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:40,662
The series of events that coincided
to make this happen was so unlikely,

371
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:43,334
it is safe to say it will
never happen again.

372
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,978
- I want to see another doctor.
- Elias.

373
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,805
- There... There must be some way...
- Elias.

374
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:51,280
We have to face this.

375
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,216
Why? Because they say so?

376
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:56,345
Listen to me. You're right here.

377
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:59,419
Looking into my eyes
and holding my hand.

378
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,527
You're not going
anywhere, Dannie.

379
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:03,829
I promise.

380
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,262
Troponin's normal,
it's not a heart attack.

381
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:15,671
- Yeah, no signs of PE.
- No clots in the heart either.

382
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:18,472
Normal valves, no wall
motion abnormalities.

383
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:22,080
But he has S/D wave
fusion on RV inflow.

384
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:23,615
His heart's not
filling properly.

385
00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:30,449
His legs are swollen.

386
00:26:31,457 --> 00:26:33,949
His fluid's not returning
from his lower body.

387
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:39,160
His anatomy adapted to his
contortions. Nothing is where it started.

388
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:42,668
And now, moving to this new position
could be trapping his vena cava.

389
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:46,603
His spine and breastbone are
squeezing off blood flow to his heart.

390
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,572
The vein's compressed.

391
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,912
- Can we prop it open with a stent?
- Too much chest cavity restriction.

392
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:00,245
Jeff's body is not letting
us straighten him out.

393
00:27:02,588 --> 00:27:04,022
We need to reverse the surgery.

394
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,523
All the king's horses...

395
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:21,103
About time Elias
took a bathroom break.

396
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:24,935
He never shuts up about you.

397
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:31,747
I know you love skiing,
both water and downhill,

398
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:34,343
and how you actually did
both the same day in Tahoe,

399
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:36,854
despite a water
temperature of 48 degrees.

400
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:41,020
I know your favorite
movie is <i>Battlefield Earth.</i>

401
00:27:41,093 --> 00:27:42,857
So bad it's good, I get it.

402
00:27:43,362 --> 00:27:46,491
And your favorite candy,
well, that, I got all on my own.

403
00:27:47,633 --> 00:27:49,602
I also heard about the puppies.

404
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:53,503
How he couldn't decide between
the three of them and so he...

405
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:54,665
Brought them all home.

406
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:58,042
Yeah.

407
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:01,837
Are you trying to tell
me that I'm a lucky girl?

408
00:28:03,315 --> 00:28:04,315
It's okay.

409
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:05,978
I know that I am.

410
00:28:07,953 --> 00:28:09,251
I found my soulmate.

411
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:15,352
Do people still use
that lame word? Heh.

412
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,965
He's a wonderful man...

413
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:25,163
who has trouble
making tough decisions.

414
00:28:25,971 --> 00:28:27,803
And he's going to
spend the rest of his life

415
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:31,571
sitting at your bedside listening
to a ventilator keeping you alive.

416
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,677
Which puts it all on you.

417
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:53,090
Screw's stuck.

418
00:28:53,165 --> 00:28:54,565
I'll try a lamina spreader.

419
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:00,533
If we do a bone graft here,

420
00:29:00,606 --> 00:29:03,405
we can re-fuse the T3
vertebrae to the way it was before.

421
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:05,273
It'll never be the
way it was before.

422
00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:08,739
We cracked his spine
at 15 different levels.

423
00:29:08,814 --> 00:29:11,147
He will be more contorted,
he'll be more in pain.

424
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:16,887
T-handle.

425
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,097
Pectus excavatum.

426
00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:37,606
Pectus excavatum.

427
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,307
If you never heard of it,
don't feel bad, it's very rare.

428
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:44,646
A person is born with a big
dent in the middle of his chest.

429
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:47,743
Sometimes it's so bad that the
breast bone presses against the heart,

430
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:51,517
you gotta break away the sternum,
you gotta crack open the ribs,

431
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:54,492
prop it up with metal bars.
If you can do that for Jeff...

432
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,127
then we can create
enough space in his chest.

433
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:02,191
Close him up, let's
turn him around.

434
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:07,830
It's a DNR.

435
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,838
I don't want to be put
back on life support.

436
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,477
That's not life.

437
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,949
You gave her this?

438
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:20,217
But I...

439
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:22,586
signed it.

440
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:28,885
You remember...

441
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:32,461
our first Valentine's
Day together?

442
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,893
You gave me that...

443
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,536
that silver pendant
with the two little hearts?

444
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:49,873
I told you I was considering
that job in Boston.

445
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:54,075
And you let me go.

446
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:55,984
- You didn't need my permission...
- I know.

447
00:30:58,056 --> 00:30:59,056
I know.

448
00:31:00,392 --> 00:31:04,193
But you knew that it was
something that I needed to do.

449
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:08,826
And you also knew...

450
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:11,897
that I was scared.

451
00:31:18,143 --> 00:31:19,270
Dannie, this isn't Boston.

452
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,279
I can't...

453
00:31:23,749 --> 00:31:25,149
I can't let you go.

454
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:26,217
I know.

455
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:32,186
I think that's why I woke up.

456
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,298
Uh-huh.

457
00:31:55,714 --> 00:31:56,977
- Hey.
- Hey.

458
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,311
Something that I've
always felt guilty about...

459
00:32:04,556 --> 00:32:05,888
Costa Rica.

460
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:10,259
That was your... dream trip.

461
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:11,421
Your mother was sick.

462
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:13,829
Mm. Not very.

463
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:16,796
But you never complained.

464
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:19,130
You canceled everything.

465
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:23,402
Did you ever go?

466
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:26,969
How could I go without you?

467
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:28,707
Because you have to.

468
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,346
For both of us.

469
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,822
Let me have that thought.

470
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:55,968
<i>Pura vida.</i>

471
00:33:10,522 --> 00:33:11,522
Dannie?

472
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:21,391
<i>Pura vida.</i>

473
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:54,696
Want to try and stand up?

474
00:34:01,273 --> 00:34:02,434
You got this.

475
00:34:12,851 --> 00:34:15,912
No, no, no. Okay, I'm
afraid I'm gonna fall.

476
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:17,848
That's why you gotta try.

477
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:38,909
There you go.

478
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:52,122
Dr. Glassman...

479
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:27,350
It's after 6.

480
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:29,917
- You're open 24 hours.
- Not saying I'm closed,

481
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:34,092
saying it's after regular business
hours. There's a $50 fee for that.

482
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:37,967
I've created 336 of the
most scathing critiques

483
00:35:38,036 --> 00:35:39,834
of you and your
sleazy operation.

484
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:44,137
So give me my car back or I'll
post them and shut your ass down.

485
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:45,507
I'm not buying it, cupcake.

486
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,079
You're no outlaw. And
I'm going to have to add

487
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,138
a $200 "unfair
business practice" fee.

488
00:35:55,053 --> 00:35:58,546
I push this button, and you can
kiss Tricky's Towing goodbye.

489
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,024
Cash or credit?

490
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:03,652
This time, I'm not
lying. Shaun, tell him.

491
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:10,501
Cash.

492
00:36:13,138 --> 00:36:14,138
This way.

493
00:36:27,452 --> 00:36:28,818
I don't...

494
00:36:49,174 --> 00:36:52,667
- Shaun!
- Drive away! Drive away!

495
00:36:52,744 --> 00:36:53,973
Get back here!

496
00:37:00,852 --> 00:37:02,718
Okay. Drive fast!

497
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:05,020
Oh, my God, Shaun!

498
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:11,556
Kick its butt.

499
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:38,722
So?

500
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:40,724
It's...

501
00:37:44,162 --> 00:37:45,162
really...

502
00:37:47,232 --> 00:37:48,232
really good.

503
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:55,072
<i>That was tight, everyone
give it up for Travers!</i>

504
00:37:58,343 --> 00:38:01,336
Next up is... Claire.

505
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:06,175
Hey. You got this.

506
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:11,054
Okay.

507
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:18,786
Um... This is a song
my... My mother taught me.

508
00:38:19,564 --> 00:38:23,365
So if you don't like
it, shame on you.

509
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:49,083
<i>♪ You can hold my hand ♪</i>

510
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:52,492

I got Jeff's post-op images.
Everything looks great.

521
00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:39,276
Yeah.

522
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:42,045
What you did was phenomenal.

523
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:44,777
It's gotta feel pretty good.

524
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:47,184
Feels great.

525
00:39:56,461 --> 00:39:57,929
Three patients I turned down.

526
00:40:00,265 --> 00:40:02,393
This world needs more
people screwed up just enough

527
00:40:02,467 --> 00:40:04,026
to think they can
do the impossible.

528
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:23,946
You owe me seven bucks.

529
00:40:24,689 --> 00:40:26,988
- This costs six.
- Delivery charge.

530
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:29,060
I just increased
your rent by 20.

531
00:40:51,049 --> 00:40:53,109
His face was awesome.

532
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:57,279
Mostly blind rage, with a
sprinkle of bewilderment.

533
00:40:57,956 --> 00:41:00,755
And how about you leaping
into the car like the man of steel?

534
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:02,088
I hurt my knee.

535
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,595
Making what you did
even more spectacular.

536
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:06,255
I can't believe
you stiffed the guy.

537
00:41:06,331 --> 00:41:07,331
I didn't.

538
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:12,732
I paid him $250, which
is what he was entitled to,

539
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,796
leaving him with no
reason to retaliate.

540
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:17,335
That is fair.

541
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:19,977
Lea...

542
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:25,043
you have been a bit...

543
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:29,014
crazy...

544
00:41:29,087 --> 00:41:31,784
the last two days,

545
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:34,553
and I needed to help
you see what was right.

546
00:41:40,465 --> 00:41:43,333
I have been a bit crazy.

547
00:41:44,402 --> 00:41:46,371
But it wasn't really
about the car.

548
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:51,669
Two days ago, I found out...

549
00:41:56,481 --> 00:41:57,481
Shaun...

550
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,379
I'm pregnant.
