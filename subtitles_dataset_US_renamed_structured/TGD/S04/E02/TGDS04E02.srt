00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,698
<i>Previously on</i> The Good Doctor:

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,898
You don't want
me to do anything.

3
00:00:05,973 --> 00:00:07,965
I spend every minute
of every day with you!

4
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:12,536
Since you feel that our time
together is something to be endured,

5
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:15,378
I decided to make
that easier for you.

6
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:18,183
Your daughter's beautiful,

7
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:20,084
needs you to get better
so you can hold her.

8
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:21,416
I read about the chill study.

9
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:24,515
She's a good candidate, I'll
take full responsibility for her.

10
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:26,457
<i>Tell him he's going to be fine.</i>

11
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:29,292
I can't. The majority
of COVID patients

12
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,229
who go on a ventilator
never come off.

13
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:34,826
Put on a mask. Now. It's
COVID. We've both been exposed.

14
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:38,361
- My mother had a necklace...
- Let me see if I can find it.

15
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:40,238
Things will be okay.

16
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:53,019
Good morning.

17
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:57,181
Morning, Shaun.

18
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:00,894
I wish you were here.

19
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:03,455
<i>Me too.</i>

20
00:01:12,773 --> 00:01:16,471
Morning, Dalisay. Woke
up with a temp of 104.

21
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:18,978
I need heated, humidified
oxygen in a high-flow cannula.

22
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:20,912
Mom, slow down, just
let her examine you.

23
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:23,644
What? So she can find out
exactly what I just told her?

24
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,050
Reznick! You're back.

25
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:30,155
Got sick, got better,
got tested twice.

26
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:31,748
Always the overachiever.

27
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,694
Dr. Reznick, her pulse ox is 90.

28
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:37,355
We need to admit you.

29
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:40,094
Is my mom going to be okay?

30
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:44,735
Don't worry, I'm gonna be fine.

31
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:49,832
Just please water my tomato
plants, give Darcy a big hug,

32
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,503
and tell her Nana
loves her so much

33
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:54,047
and can't wait to play
with her again real soon.

34
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:55,748
Okay, Mom.

35
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:07,389
Nice hesitation. Why not just
suggest he get my house appraised?

36
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:12,792
Sorry, it took a
while to find it.

37
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,333
Thank you.

38
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:19,196
Being able to hold this and
keep it with me, it's a connection.

39
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:24,741
Like she's still here with me.

40
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:59,071
It's stuff, Claire. It's
meaningless now.

41
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:03,015
Each one of these
tells an interrupted story.

42
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,081
A voicemail that'll
never be heard,

43
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:08,884
a shopping list for a home-cooked
meal that'll never be made.

44
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:11,482
Beautiful. Cook
spaghetti carbonara

45
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:13,527
for a dead guy's family
and the grief is gone.

46
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:17,055
Are you here to mock
me or to help me?

47
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:19,694
Why are you here?

48
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:34,145
"Donald Sulkin."

49
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:40,314
We're reducing the pressure
of air going into his lungs

50
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:41,650
and watching his oxygen level.

51
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,552
So far, so good. O2 is steady.

52
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:47,626
<i>Okay.</i>

53
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:52,655
Yes. But his end-tidal
CO2 is falling.

54
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,565
<i>What does that mean?</i>

55
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,967
It's not as bad as his O2
falling, but still not good.

56
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,396
Turn the pressure
support back up.

57
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,576
End-tidal CO2 is very low,

58
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:08,410
- not improving.
<i>- What's going on?</i>

59
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:16,681
I think he has a blood clot in his
lung interfering with his gas exchange.

60
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,089
Give him a bolus of heparin,

61
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:21,356
start him on a drip, let's
get him to the cath lab. Go.

62
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:22,487
<i>What's going on?</i>

63
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,460
<i>Where are you taking him?</i>

64
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:31,295
<i>Dr. Andrews? Dr. Murphy? Martin!</i>

65
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:34,539
This is isotonic
saline, saltwater.

66
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,440
It's four degrees Celsius.

67
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:41,875
I'll run this into your bloodstream
until your body temperature drops

68
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,678
to 34 degrees Celsius.

69
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:48,347
The paralytic I gave you
will stop you from shivering

70
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:53,553
while the cold slows your heart,
your brain, all metabolic functions.

71
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:57,325
All of the energy saved there
will go towards healing your lungs.

72
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:03,136
Your baby's waiting for you.

73
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,683
Pete, follow him.

74
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:21,483
Pete. Follow him,
he's got the ax.

75
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:23,114
<i>I was getting shot at.</i>

76
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,523
Well, stay low, reload,
and head for the temple.

77
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:26,592
Stop messing around.

78
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,323
<i>AG24, what's up
with you? You okay?</i>

79
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:32,264
Yeah, yeah, I'm hunting for
the legendary Tusk of Ganesh

80
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,995
at 3 in the morning because
everything is just super.

81
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,503
I can't go out, I can't
sleep, I can't go to work.

82
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,167
<i>Welcome to COVID,
everything sucks.</i>

83
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:43,676
Great, good... good pep talk.

84
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:46,178
You all sleeping
in an empty bed?

85
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:47,407
<i>- Yeah.
- Yeah.</i>

86
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:51,444
It's like I killed a
puppy or something.

87
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,419
Hey, Pete... Pete, heads up!

88
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:56,046
The fortress is the
perfect place for an am...

89
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:57,283
Okay, Pete's dead.

90
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,353
- <i>You should apologize.</i>
- Just play the game.

91
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:03,329
<i>Not saying you have to mean it,
just saying you should apologize.</i>

92
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:06,025
Well, that's great.
Be a hypocrite.

93
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,260
You married?

94
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:08,358
<i>I'm 15.</i>

95
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:11,803
Oh, well, thank you
for a lifetime of wisdom.

96
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:15,239
<i>My girlfriend was pissed at me
for something I didn't even do,</i>

97
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:18,039
<i>but I said sorry, and
now we're back together.</i>

98
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:22,171
<i>Maybe I'm a hypocrite, but at
least I'm a hypocrite with a girlfriend.</i>

99
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,831
Up and at them. We gotta
be downtown by noon.

100
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:43,997
Ha. Oh, yeah, we're late for the
protest. Gotta get this state opened up.

101
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:48,438
Pulse ox is 82.
Everything else looks okay.

102
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:51,068
Sure, other than my steadily
declining oxygen levels,

103
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:52,635
I am the picture of health.

104
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,348
- Let's start making signs.
- Hmm.

105
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:57,976
I'm thinking...

106
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:02,456
"Don't tread on
my right to kill you."

107
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:07,153
Hmm. How about, "Give
me liberty and give me death."

108
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:13,966
I need to go.

109
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,644
Nothing. We haven't had a patient
named Sulkin in over ten years.

110
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:29,476
Being dead doesn't change because
your loved one gets a memento back.

111
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:34,610
And fixating on dead
people? It's not a life.

112
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:40,857
How can anyone not be
answering their phone right now

113
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:43,192
if they're not an
essential worker?

114
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:45,755
What non-essential worker
are you trying to reach?

115
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:46,832
Lea.

116
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:51,363
Well, people don't go out anymore,
but they do still go to the bathroom.

117
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:54,567
This is the second time in an
hour she hasn't picked up, Claire.

118
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,135
We keep learning more
things about this disease.

119
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:00,212
It's...

120
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:02,681
It's...

121
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:06,386
I don't know. It's not right.

122
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:19,031
<i>We love you, Grandma.</i>

123
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:24,530
<i>Mom, I'm so sorry. I love you.</i>

124
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:27,333
<i>And I want you to
know that we'll be okay.</i>

125
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:29,239
<i>We love you.</i>

126
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,065
He's gone.

127
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:22,122
She's gone.

128
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:34,069
They're gone.

129
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:13,541
It's not always fun.

130
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,673
Whatever you're
talking about, no, it isn't.

131
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,813
- But what are you talking about?
- Do you love Mia?

132
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:25,784
Of course I do.

133
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:27,521
What do you love about her?

134
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:36,201
I love that she loves our son,

135
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:40,662
I love how she talks to him,
how she knows what he's thinking,

136
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,764
knows what he needs...

137
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:42,900
I thought so.

138
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,000
You thought what?

139
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:45,807
You love Kellan.

140
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:53,610
Hello. Are you okay?

141
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,606
<i>I'm sorry I didn't pick
up when you called.</i>

142
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,851
<i>- I didn't want to upset you.</i>
- It didn't work.

143
00:10:57,924 --> 00:11:01,417
<i>I had a sore throat, so I got
tested for COVID, and I'm negative.</i>

144
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,986
COVID tests have a high
percentage of false negatives.

145
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,224
<i>I feel fine now.</i>

146
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:06,960
That doesn't mean
you don't have COVID.

147
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:08,262
I need to go to work.

148
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,406
How are you adjusting
to your new specialty?

149
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,209
It's great. Love
being an internist.

150
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:26,617
Well, I'm convinced.

151
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:31,349
Dealing with conscious
people isn't really your thing.

152
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:33,225
I'm fine.

153
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:36,360
You're rude, abrasive,

154
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:40,560
and now you gotta hold
people's hands and be nice.

155
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:46,799
It's a huge adjustment and I find
it completely draining. You happy?

156
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:53,440
There's a lot of different
approaches to nice.

157
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:59,918
Otherwise, I wouldn't have
lasted 40 years as a nurse.

158
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:02,584
You'll find your own.

159
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:07,921
Or maybe you won't.

160
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:13,895
Overall, everything
is looking up.

161
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:15,765
Fewer patients coming in.

162
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,804
When they do, we're
getting better at...

163
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:24,076
Hey, buddy. I'm sorry I
keep missing your calls.

164
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,309
I've got this patient, yeah, the
mom of the baby I told you about.

165
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,481
I basically put her into
suspended animation,

166
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:33,247
but it doesn't
seem to be helping.

167
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,015
<i>When are you coming to Phoenix?</i>

168
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,454
I still don't know.

169
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:39,651
<i>You're going to make my
graduation party, though, right?</i>

170
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:43,190
I don't think so.
This patient needs...

171
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,823
<i>You? No one else
can take care of her?</i>

172
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:48,333
I kind of went out
on a limb on this one.

173
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:50,836
<i>Well, if you made a
commitment, then...</i>

174
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:09,647
Your husband has
blood in his N.G. tube.

175
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:10,951
He's developed heparin-induced

176
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:13,289
thrombocytopenia. We
need to stop the heparin.

177
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:16,124
<i>Doesn't that put him
at risk for another clot?</i>

178
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:19,290
Yes, if he's not on the
heparin, he could have a stroke,

179
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:22,199
and if he's on it, he could
have a fatal internal bleed.

180
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:23,736
And he still has an infection,

181
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:27,240
so we can't stop the antibiotics
or he'll get sepsis and die.

182
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:31,540
<i>All you do is tell me new ways
that my husband might die.</i>

183
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:34,339
<i>Every time I talk to
you, there's another way.</i>

184
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:36,212
<i>I mean, do you even
know what you're doing?</i>

185
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:38,148
<i>What is the point of
you? You're useless!</i>

186
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:40,209
We understand your frustration.

187
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:42,482
COVID targets so many organs...

188
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,217
- Technically, it's your fault.
- Shaun.

189
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:47,522
Martin never left the apartment,
but he still caught COVID,

190
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:50,427
you must have exposed
him to it. On the other hand,

191
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,728
- we are doing all that we can to...
- That's enough. That's enough.

192
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,765
We're all going through crap,

193
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,832
but that woman's
husband may be dying.

194
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:06,073
She's allowed to
lash out. You aren't.

195
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:19,991
Hey.

196
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:28,728
I'm sorry.

197
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:49,912
Why?

198
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:53,716
What?

199
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,890
What are you sorry about?

200
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,927
Everything.

201
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:06,997
The fight, and you
sleeping in the other room,

202
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:08,837
and you ignoring me.

203
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:12,606
So you're sorry because
of the way I've been acting?

204
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:14,340
I'm apologizing.

205
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:15,575
I don't think you are.

206
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:18,250
I don't get it. You won.

207
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:21,153
I don't know what you want.

208
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,712
We can't have a
difference of opinion?

209
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,952
No. Not when we disagree

210
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:28,460
on whether you've
been mean to me or not.

211
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:29,996
You've been mean to me!

212
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:50,177
Three tours, helicopter pilot.

213
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,548
He's got a medal on that one.

214
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:56,481
Hey, look at this.
Same guy again.

215
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:59,458
Funny, almost as if they were
in the same unit or something.

216
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:00,788
Greg Lavin.

217
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:07,033
Died here. COVID, one month ago.

218
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:15,707
Hello, Enid Lavin?

219
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:20,570
Hi, this is Dr. Claire Browne
from San Jose St. Bonaventure.

220
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,707
I'm so sorry for your loss.
I just wanted you to know

221
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:25,775
that we have found
something of your father's.

222
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:29,383
A memento of his
service. Dog tags.

223
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:34,992
No, no, not his, a man by
the name of Donald Sulkin.

224
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:38,897
Donald Sulkin?

225
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,070
Thank you.

226
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:48,898
That's odd.

227
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:49,975
Yeah.

228
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:54,610
How does your father carry
someone else's dog tags for 50 years

229
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,911
and you have never
even heard of them?

230
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,754
How are you feeling?

231
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,593
My son plans to move to Montana.

232
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,576
Take my granddaughter
1000 miles away.

233
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,574
The schools are
better, the air is cleaner.

234
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:34,721
So the upside of all this is, I
don't have to move to Montana.

235
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,649
Is that why you
haven't okayed us

236
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,717
putting you on a
ventilator if you need one?

237
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:46,856
I know what
ventilators do to people.

238
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:54,738
Do you remember Dr. Pitcairn?

239
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:57,299
Pitstain?

240
00:17:58,911 --> 00:17:59,911
Exactly.

241
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:03,642
Remember when I
was a first-year resident?

242
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:07,385
One of two women,
only woman of color.

243
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,783
I'd been warned
he'd make my life hell.

244
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:13,883
And sure enough, second week,
Pitstain starts tearing into me

245
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,589
about the spacing of my
sutures being inconsistent,

246
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:19,894
and I'm about to fall
apart in front of everybody,

247
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:21,992
but then you stepped in.

248
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:27,270
Brought up some charting error
he made. A tiny blip of a mistake.

249
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,910
He never capitalized "stat."

250
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,978
The whole point
is for it to stand out.

251
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,844
You put him back on his
heels in front of everybody.

252
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:39,613
You gave me time.

253
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,444
To regain my composure.

254
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:46,315
He never got to see me cry.

255
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:54,126
Please, if it comes to it,
give me a little time again.

256
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:57,698
To help you.

257
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,555
No, no, no.

258
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,865
I don't know what
to do. I love Lea,

259
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:31,563
- and I wanted her to love...
- Okay. Okay, I'll be right down.

260
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:32,661
Okay?

261
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:41,379
I don't know what to do.

262
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:46,215
I love Lea and I wanted
her to love me back,

263
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,948
and now she does,
but we can't be together.

264
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,014
How can loving someone who
loves you back make things worse?

265
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:57,223
Well, that's a... That's
a good question.

266
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:00,591
Let's start with what's
making things worse.

267
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:03,001
I think...

268
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,006
I think I may be... cranky.

269
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:10,132
I've never been cranky before.

270
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,769
I don't like it. I
think I miss Lea.

271
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:16,243
I think I'm worried
that she has COVID.

272
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:19,444
So you're going crazy
because you can't see someone?

273
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,252
What am I supposed to do?

274
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,881
Should I not talk to Lea
until the pandemic is over?

275
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:29,618
Well, that's an option.
Is that what you want?

276
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:32,927
No. No, I don't
want that at all.

277
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:36,730
But I don't want to
feel like this, either.

278
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:38,498
I want this to be over.

279
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:43,537
Well, we all want it
to be over, Shaun.

280
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:47,474
I mean, we're sick of ourselves,
we're sick of each other,

281
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:49,606
or we're pining for
someone we can't be with.

282
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:51,275
We're confused,
we're uncomfortable.

283
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,810
On top of everything else,

284
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:56,754
we're scared that the world
will never be the same again.

285
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,059
And I don't know, Shaun.

286
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:02,652
I don't have a map
for this kind of thing.

287
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,928
The best I can say is...

288
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,060
be kind.

289
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:12,829
Be kind to yourself, be kind...

290
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,066
to everyone.

291
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:18,370
Because what else is there?

292
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:45,194
<i>♪ Every now and then
I get a little bit lonely ♪</i>

293
00:21:45,271 --> 00:21:47,536
<i>♪ And you're never
coming 'round ♪</i>

294
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:49,370
<i>♪ Turn around ♪</i>

295
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:51,501
<i>♪ Every now and

296
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:53,307
<i>Oh. Hi.</i>

297
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:57,415
Well, this is a nice song.

298
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:59,213
<i>♪ Every now and then I get... ♪</i>

299
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:00,913
<i>I hate this song.</i>

300
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,182
Good. I was being kind.

301
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:06,353
<i>Martin hates it too.</i>

302
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,125
<i>It was the first
conversation we had,</i>

303
00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:12,688
<i>talking about how
weird this song is.</i>

304
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:17,430
<i>Who is Bright Eyes, and why is it
so important that they turn around?</i>

305
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,897
<i>♪ Every now and

306
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:23,204

308
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:28,013
<i>♪ And I need you

309
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,677
<i>You're probably right.
That he got COVID from me.</i>

310
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:38,582
It's hard.

311
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:44,391
To think of someone you love
when you can't be with them.

312
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:50,196
<i>♪ Your love is like a shadow
On me all of the time... ♪</i>

313
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:54,468
He seems to have a posterior
tibial artery thrombosis.

314
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,974
<i>What? That sounds bad.</i>

315
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,340
It is. It's a blockage
in the artery,

316
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:02,108
causing ischemia to his lower
extremity tissues due to lack of...

317
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:04,981
I want to be kind to
you. I want to explain,

318
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,679
but it's a very long explanation
and I don't have time for you

319
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:10,587
- to get mad and upset...
<i>- Just go help my husband.</i>

320
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:11,817
Okay.

321
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,054
Your numbers are falling.

322
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:17,629
I know.

323
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,721
You need a ventilator.

324
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,066
I know.

325
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:30,702
There's a pocket in
my purse. Reach into it.

326
00:23:37,316 --> 00:23:40,753
Game Seven, 2003, American
League Championship.

327
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:43,584
Grady let Pedro go
one inning too long.

328
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:48,525
The Sox handed the
series to the damn Yankees.

329
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:52,597
My son and I cried
in each other's arms.

330
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,596
I've kept them
with me ever since.

331
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:03,266
It's like Jimmy's
always with me.

332
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:10,613
You're not alone.

333
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:21,354
You're stuck with all of us.

334
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:34,424
Can you take your
earbuds out, please?

335
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:44,767
I don't think that I've
done anything wrong.

336
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:49,039
But I may be wrong about
that. I suspect that I am.

337
00:25:56,922 --> 00:26:00,620
I haven't been
thinking straight lately.

338
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,629
What with everything
going on at the hospital.

339
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:06,722
People are dying and I'm here.

340
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,898
And that makes me feel weak.

341
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:15,096
And then I feel scared,
and that makes me feel...

342
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:17,566
even more weak.

343
00:26:18,811 --> 00:26:25,684
And then I feel relieved
and safe that I'm here.

344
00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:33,091
And that makes me
feel like a coward.

345
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:44,402
Thank you.

346
00:26:47,406 --> 00:26:48,499
Thank you?

347
00:26:48,574 --> 00:26:51,840
I just needed an honest moment.

348
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:55,340
Something...

349
00:26:56,515 --> 00:27:01,818
to let me know that
you actually need me.

350
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:06,851
And...

351
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:09,627
I'm sorry.

352
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,166
I'm sorry too.

353
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,324
Hi, buddy.

354
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:43,394
<i>Hey, Dad.</i>

355
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:46,357
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

356
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:50,194
<i>I shouldn't have gotten angry
about you not coming to Phoenix.</i>

357
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:52,534
<i>It wasn't fair.</i>

358
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:54,238
Thank you.

359
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:58,934
Did your mother
put you up to this?

360
00:28:00,746 --> 00:28:01,746
<i>She was right.</i>

361
00:28:02,548 --> 00:28:05,017
<i>I don't even really care
about the party that much.</i>

362
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:07,182
Then what was the issue?

363
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:10,783
<i>We don't have
to talk about that.</i>

364
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:12,415
I want to know
what's bothering you.

365
00:28:15,127 --> 00:28:18,120
<i>I know your job is important.</i>

366
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:21,023
<i>But sometimes,</i>

367
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:24,797
<i>I just want to know you care about
me more than you care about the job.</i>

368
00:28:36,615 --> 00:28:38,550
When your mom got pregnant...

369
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:41,714
I was so nervous.

370
00:28:42,788 --> 00:28:44,723
Suddenly, everything was real.

371
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,725
Suddenly, I had a commitment.

372
00:28:47,326 --> 00:28:49,386
And I wasn't sure I was ready.

373
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,396
And then you were born.

374
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:56,800
And in that moment,
I mean that moment,

375
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:58,302
everything changed.

376
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:01,766
I was instantly head
over heels in love with you.

377
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:04,337
You were my best friend.

378
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:07,540
And I held you,

379
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:10,009
and the words just came out,

380
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,414
I said, "Hi, buddy."

381
00:29:13,552 --> 00:29:16,317
I'd never called anyone
buddy before in my life.

382
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:20,851
But you were my buddy.

383
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:26,355
I may make mistakes,
over and over again,

384
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,956
but don't ever think...

385
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:30,332
you're not the most
important thing in my life.

386
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:38,966
<i>So, basically, you're saying your
love for me is like chemical, right?</i>

387
00:29:44,216 --> 00:29:45,216
Yeah.

388
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:04,499
Thank you for your call. Your
husband is still unconscious. Bye.

389
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:07,061
<i>Whoa, whoa, how is
he? How was the surgery?</i>

390
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:12,043
Dr. Andrews will explain, but
I'd rather not say anything more.

391
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:16,239
The last two times I gave you
bad news, you yelled at me.

392
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:18,307
<i>Bad news? What is the bad news?</i>

393
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,011
Oh.

394
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:25,022
Okay.

395
00:30:25,624 --> 00:30:27,820
We amputated
Martin's foot and ankle.

396
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:30,328
We are now trying to
reintroduce anticoagulation

397
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:31,658
so he won't have more clots.

398
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:33,494
But he will be at risk
for more bleeding.

399
00:30:42,641 --> 00:30:43,641
<i>Thank you.</i>

400
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:46,143
Mm.

401
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:49,245
Are you sure you understand?

402
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:53,342
He's still on a ventilator
and he lost a foot.

403
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:55,751
You were very upset yesterday.

404
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:58,789
<i>Yesterday, I thought
he was dying...</i>

405
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:01,726
<i>but today he's alive.</i>

406
00:31:02,728 --> 00:31:04,526
<i>So thank you.</i>

407
00:31:08,734 --> 00:31:09,734
You're welcome.

408
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:14,298
Can I hang up now?

409
00:31:15,574 --> 00:31:17,202
<i>Yes. Yes, thank...</i>

410
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:23,591
I figured you're bored
of just hearing my voice,

411
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:26,244
so I brought a mutual friend.

412
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:32,114
The risks are minimal, and
whatever time you have...

413
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:35,055
some of it should
be with your family.

414
00:32:04,723 --> 00:32:07,283
Yes, I'm trying to track
down a Donald Sulkin.

415
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:09,225
<i>No. No one here by that name.</i>

416
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:10,956
Okay, sorry to bother you.

417
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:15,997
Your plan is to call every
D. Sulkin in North America,

418
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:17,797
all to return a set of dog tags?

419
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,385
<i>You've reached
Diana Sulkin. Please...</i>

420
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:26,378
Ugh.

421
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:28,641
You want a happy
ending for this guy.

422
00:32:29,481 --> 00:32:31,677
Because you and
I didn't have one.

423
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:34,117
Because we'll never know
how our story could have ended.

424
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:35,814
<i>Hello?</i>

425
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:36,980
Is Donald Sulkin there?

426
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:38,751
This doesn't change anything.

427
00:32:38,824 --> 00:32:40,486
This can't change anything.

428
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,824
You're wrong. It changes things.

429
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:44,522
It makes me feel...

430
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:47,489
something besides sad.

431
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,997
And I need that. I
need to not feel sad.

432
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:54,062
Because everything sucks.
Everything hurts like hell.

433
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:58,133
People are sick with
COVID, with cancer, with grief,

434
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,701
and we can't help them.

435
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:01,974
People are dying and
we can't help them.

436
00:33:02,047 --> 00:33:04,380
And what is worse,
you're not there.

437
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:15,792
It has to hurt.

438
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:19,864
A lot. For a while.

439
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:21,956
When your mom died,

440
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:25,595
you did everything you could
to not feel anything. At all.

441
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:28,834
But this time, you're facing it.

442
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:30,701
You're grieving.

443
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:33,511
You're healing.

444
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:12,716
It's time.

445
00:34:14,486 --> 00:34:16,079
No. Not today.

446
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:18,422
Today.

447
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,565
<i>We love you, Mom.</i>

448
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:37,641
I'm sorry.

449
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,780
<i>It's okay.</i>

450
00:34:45,317 --> 00:34:46,317
<i>Mom...</i>

451
00:34:47,352 --> 00:34:48,513
<i>I love you.</i>

452
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:50,882

475
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:39,227
You know, my mom
used to talk about you.

476
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:41,899
A lot.

477
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,729
She told me what you
did in the earthquake.

478
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:47,971
The price you paid.

479
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:54,511
She said you can rest
easy if you've got that...

480
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:57,043
tough Reznick in your corner.

481
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:04,919
I'm thinking she didn't exactly
phrase it that way, did she?

482
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:07,549
No. She didn't.

483
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,068
Donald Sulkin?

484
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,104
How can I help you?

485
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:28,146
I'm Dr. Claire Browne.

486
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:33,342
Greg Lavin died at
my hospital last month.

487
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,320
Greg.

488
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,856
He had this with
him when he passed.

489
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,842
I gave these to Greg
at the end of the war.

490
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:03,881
We were...

491
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:08,185
friends.

492
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:13,524
Thank you.

493
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,126
Thank you.

494
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,479
That was beautiful.

495
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:45,917
That room is filled with
stories that were cut short.

496
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:48,258
Like ours.

497
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:55,757
But you, you have an
amazing story ahead.

498
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:58,835
I can't wait to see it.

499
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:24,056
<i>You can come home?</i>

500
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:28,093
I can come home. But...

501
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:30,793
<i>But?</i>

502
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:34,900
Do you love me?

503
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:37,274
Of course I love you.

504
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:40,411
<i>What do you love about me?</i>

505
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,877
I love that you love our son.

506
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:49,216
<i>I love watching you two talk.</i>

507
00:39:50,255 --> 00:39:53,487
<i>I love the way Kellan
lights up when he's with you.</i>

508
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,619
I love you too.

509
00:39:58,496 --> 00:39:59,987
For all the same reasons.

510
00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:04,599
<i>We both want to be there
for Kellan. And we are.</i>

511
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:07,838
But...

512
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:13,000
you and I don't need
to be together to do that.

513
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:27,717
Are you okay if...?

514
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:34,330
Maybe it's time we
stopped coming here.

515
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,294
You ready to move on?

516
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:38,135
No.

517
00:40:39,504 --> 00:40:42,668
But he'll still be with us,
right? Wherever we are.

518
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:47,877
He changed me.

519
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:54,610
And that's not gonna go away.

00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:15,797
I have everything I need to
stay overnight, including this.

Negative for COVID.
