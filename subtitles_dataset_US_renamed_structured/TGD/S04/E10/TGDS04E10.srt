1
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,514
Perfect.

2
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:19,685
What are you doing to me?

3
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:22,852
<i>Not the results we'd hoped for.</i>

4
00:00:22,923 --> 00:00:25,757
Your labs confirm what
we saw on the ultrasound.

5
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:27,795
You're in end
stage liver disease.

6
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:30,024
But I always took my medicine.

7
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:33,261
I know. You're the most
compliant patient I have,

8
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:37,065
but autoimmune hepatitis can
progress even with treatment.

9
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:39,539
You need a liver transplant.

10
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:41,575
We talked about that
before, remember?

11
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:46,040
But you're gonna have a
fantastic team of surgeons

12
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:48,105
working their tails
off to get you fixed up.

13
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:52,017
We're gonna get you admitted.
Do you have any questions?

14
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:57,855
Someone has to
die so I can live?

15
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,470
I want to pray,

16
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:15,805
but I can't pray for
someone else to die.

17
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:25,608
Ooh! Hold the door!

18
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:30,115
Thank you. I'm
late enough already.

19
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:34,725
- What happened to you?
- Oh, not much.

20
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:36,515
Just slept through my
alarm, stubbed my toe,

21
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:38,725
then got a parking
ticket and a flat tire.

22
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,564
You drive a 50-year-old relic
and you don't use Triple A?

23
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:44,161
I drive a 44-year-old
car, and it takes longer

24
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:46,477
to wait for help than it does
to put the spare on myself.

25
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,020
I'm surprised you
know how to use it.

26
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:50,203
- Because I'm a woman?
- Because you're a millennial.

27
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:52,337
Also an engineer who used
to work for a car company.

28
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:54,404
A computer company.
You built software.

29
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:55,676
For self-driving cars.

30
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:57,860
So Sony is a car company
because they build stereos...

31
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,716
My point is that I know
how to change a tire

32
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,051
faster than any tow
truck driver. Or you.

33
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:05,149
Okay, no need to be hostile. I'm
just trying to make conversation.

34
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,293
Have a nice day.

35
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:16,596
- What do you got?
- He almost drowned in a triathlon.

36
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,400
We restarted his
heart, but he's obtunded

37
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:21,306
- and breathing's labored.
- He was in a triathlon?

38
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:25,101
Agonal respiration,
accessory muscle use...

39
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:27,204
- His sats are dropping.
- It's Cort Graham.

40
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,492
Eight liters oxygen. Are we
supposed to know who that is?

41
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:31,382
Cancer survivor and
endurance athlete.

42
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:33,249
Also heads a big cancer charity.

43
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,119
Left lung has focal
consolidation and fluid collection.

44
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:37,680
- I need a chest tube.
- On it.

45
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:40,626
If he's an experienced swimmer,
something must've made him pass out.

46
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:42,560
Could be a heart attack. Stroke.

47
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:43,892
- Head trauma?
- From swimming?

48
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:45,227
I did a sprint tri once.

49
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:47,199
The swim was like a
roller derby in water.

50
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:50,965
Oh, damn it. Pyxis won't open. I
put in my code but nothing happens.

51
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:52,768
Well, figure it out. We
need the chest tube.

52
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,899
I'm going to go in
with a ten blade.

53
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:57,706
That won't release enough fluid.

54
00:02:58,311 --> 00:02:59,472
I know.

55
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:06,511
Come on!

56
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:08,816
Oh, he's cyanotic.

57
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:12,518
- Come on, open!
- Get out of the way.

58
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:24,499
Don't just stand
there. Get the tube.

59
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,529
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

60
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:32,571
What's going on?
Why didn't it open?

61
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:35,343
I don't know. The power's on,
but our computers are down.

62
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:37,748
- All of them? The whole hospital?
- Looks that way.

63
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:58,137
We'll need to temporarily
close the clinic, E.R.,

64
00:03:58,205 --> 00:03:59,332
and divert new patients.

65
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:02,205
Good news is the O.R.s
are isolated from the network.

66
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,904
So we won't be able to share
imaging on external monitors,

67
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,607
but the MRI and radiology
machines are still functional.

68
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:10,446
Well, great. Let's postpone
all elective procedures,

69
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:12,713
keep the most urgent
cases on the board.

70
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:15,153
Got it. You call the cops?

71
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:17,054
San Jose Police and the FBI,

72
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:19,787
and the Cyber Attack
insurance carrier.

73
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,123
What's the ransom?

74
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:25,187
Two million. Well, we
have the data backed up.

75
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:27,567
We got it covered.

76
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:31,766
We got a problem.

77
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:35,439
If it's only one problem, it'll
make me extraordinarily happy.

78
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:36,509
No, it won't.

79
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:39,444
They actually hacked into the
network over three months ago.

80
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:41,573
Took their time to not
only encrypt our servers,

81
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:43,583
but our on-site and
cloud-based backups.

82
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,745
- Don't we have backups? Data?
- Actually, we have three,

83
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,789
which get rotated
out every 30 days,

84
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,653
which means the
oldest backup we have

85
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:53,216
was synced four days
after the bastards broke in.

86
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,852
And we have no data?

87
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:56,396
Technically, we still have data.

88
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:59,023
We just can't access it
without their encryption key.

89
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:01,599
Okay.

90
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:05,105
You can't pay the ransom. You
don't negotiate with terrorists.

91
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:08,006
No, what I can't do is pay an
exorbitant amount of money

92
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:10,168
to an insurance company
and then not use them.

93
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:11,973
They gave us 24
hours to get the Bitcoin.

94
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,125
If I can find a mistake in
their encryption software,

95
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:16,082
I might be able to
get our data back.

96
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,778
Of course, I'll also have
to retrace the attack chain

97
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,582
to find the exact
door they came in.

98
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:23,574
Otherwise we might as well toss every
computer we have in the recycle bin.

99
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:26,886
If you're trying to convince
me to not pay the ransom,

100
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,623
you maybe shouldn't
have said that last part.

101
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:31,255
I realized that
as I was saying it.

102
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:37,566
You've got 24 hours.

103
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:46,312
The surgery shouldn't be a
problem, but finding a liver will be.

104
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,371
- Her MELD score puts her first up.
- On our list,

105
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:51,282
which still leaves her competing
against every patient in the region.

106
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,786
No procurement coordinator
is gonna discriminate against

107
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,220
a patient with Down syndrome,

108
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:58,588
but they are gonna give a patient with
shorter life expectancy a low priority.

109
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:01,560
She also lives alone and doesn't
have any family to help with recovery.

110
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:03,392
She's worked so hard
to be independent,

111
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:06,456
- and now it's gonna be held against her?
- It sucks, but it's not unfair.

112
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,398
I'm not giving up.

113
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,206
You don't have to worry about
the list if you can find a living donor.

114
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:15,936
Look for one who's already
volunteered to give a kidney.

115
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:18,487
Get help. With the network down,
everything's gonna take longer

116
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:19,843
and she doesn't have much time.

117
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:28,045
I couldn't have gotten kicked,
wasn't even close to the pack.

118
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:30,757
I thought swim was
your strongest section?

119
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:34,386
Usually, but I let my
ego get the best of me.

120
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:37,659
I went out way too fast and
got dropped at the first turn.

121
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,962
Well, I'm impressed
you're even out there.

122
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:41,831
I can barely finish a 5K.

123
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,102
I used to be the same way too.

124
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,706
Cancer actually made
me a better runner.

125
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:46,772
That can't be true.

126
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,300
The chemo you had
reduces lung capacity.

127
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:51,902
And how could losing a leg
make you a faster runner?

128
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:54,812
Well, once you get past
a mile it's not about speed,

129
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:57,976
it's about pain, and how much
you're willing to push through.

130
00:06:58,051 --> 00:07:00,987
And my threshold definitely
increased after chemo and rehab.

131
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:04,320
And seeing the
hope I give survivors

132
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:07,020
every single time that
I cross a finish line,

133
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,119
that doesn't hurt either.

134
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,027
His cancer could be back.

135
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,225
The odds of sarcoma
reoccurrence are very high.

136
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:17,328
Oh, it could be lots of things.
It could be a virus or bacteria.

137
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:18,633
More likely cancer.

138
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:21,197
Overtraining can weaken
the immune system.

139
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:25,572
I'm a motivational speaker, so
literally a professional optimist.

140
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:28,408
I can handle the truth.

141
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:31,041
Dr. Murphy is probably right,

142
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:34,178
but we'll do a full blood panel
and chest C.T. to be sure.

143
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:40,258
The good news is it's clearly
an underfunded startup.

144
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:41,625
Their website's garbage,

145
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:43,823
and the ransom's only
half your cyber policy limit.

146
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:46,992
Underfunded? Startup?
Website? Where do I start?

147
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,661
Despite what you see on TV,

148
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,431
these attacks don't
come from lone wolves.

149
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:51,596
It's a global business,

150
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:54,072
with websites and
customer service call centers.

151
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,508
Our I.T. director thinks that we
might be able to decrypt the data.

152
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,671
Even if he could do
that, which is impossible,

153
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:00,679
it wouldn't do any good

154
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:02,827
unless he could also
retrace the entire attack chain.

155
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:03,941
She explained that.

156
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:08,117
She also said that she
might be able to do both.

157
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:09,850
I'm sure your I.T.
director's excellent.

158
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:13,860
I'm also sure that this is
outside her area of expertise.

159
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:16,590
The only way to retrieve
your data is to pay the fee.

160
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:19,428
I'm sure I can negotiate it
down to a few hundred grand.

161
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,558
From two million?

162
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:23,467
Well, they're amateurs. I'm not.

163
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:27,899
Thought I had a perfect match,
but she's in Shanghai on business.

164
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,772
- How long's a flight from...
- Eleven hours.

165
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,123
But I couldn't talk her into it.

166
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,417
She's about to close the
most important deal of her life.

167
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:36,177
Who talked to John
Raponi? Retired firefighter,

168
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,444
peak physical condition.

169
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:41,079
I did. He was at
a bar. At 3 p.m.

170
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:44,147
Doesn't give me high hopes that
his liver will be in perfect condition.

171
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:48,184
- Not ideal, but not disqualifying.
- Rachel Trainor's the better option.

172
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:52,697
She's local, a preschool teacher,
and an extremely devout Christian.

173
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:54,667
What makes you
think her faith helps us?

174
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:57,330
I'm a devout Christian

175
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:59,930
and I'm not sure I'd be a live
liver donor for a family member,

176
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:01,531
much less a stranger.

177
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:03,668
You may be devout,
but you're also selfish.

178
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,445
I mean, we all are,
relatively speaking.

179
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:12,611
So, what makes you
think Rachel isn't?

180
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:13,778
Her Instagram.

181
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:15,253
I mean, you'd be surprised

182
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,654
by how much you can
learn from what people "like."

183
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,852
And Rachel likes
everything she sees.

184
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:22,191
Like, literally everything.

185
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:29,334
We rescheduled the chemo
appointments we could,

186
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,580
but there's still three that
need their infusions today.

187
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:33,324
We're doing our best
to modify the regimens.

188
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:35,342
Okay. Check and see if
they got second opinions

189
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,842
from other oncologists,

190
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,675
and if so, then maybe
we can use those records.

191
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:40,645
Okay.

192
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,306
- And keep me posted.
- Yes.

193
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,816
What the hell? You
said I had 24 hours.

194
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:49,151
God, you're gonna
give me a heart attack.

195
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:50,884
I authorized a negotiation.

196
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,687
I didn't authorize the payment.

197
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,729
- You don't trust me?
- It's not about trust. It's about...

198
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,662
weighing the costs of a delay.

199
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,859
Well, then you should
know your costs just went up.

200
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,194
They sent us a Signal text.

201
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:09,234
What's a bot worm?

202
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:11,574
It's what happens when
you listen to an insurance rep

203
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:13,306
instead of your own head of I.T.

204
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,175
They were insulted by the
offer, so they doubled the ransom

205
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:19,583
and activated malware.

206
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,282
If we don't pay, they're
gonna delete our data

207
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:25,587
and destroy all of our MRI,
CT, and x-ray machines.

208
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:37,395
They obviously just figured
out what the policy limit is,

209
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,167
which means they didn't do their
research and are now improvising.

210
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,367
They're playing catch-up.

211
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:43,281
Can you still get them
down to a few hundred K?

212
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,505
No. That was before they
had the policy information.

213
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:49,014
We'll end up between their
initial and current demands.

214
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:52,109
This is just a piece of paper
and a check to you, isn't it?

215
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:54,105
I'm sorry you're upset
because your insurance rep

216
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,632
- wants to promptly pay a claim?
- The frequency of these attacks

217
00:10:56,656 --> 00:11:00,388
is skyrocketing because insurance
companies make it so easy to collect.

218
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,486
I quibble with the analysis,
accept the compliment.

219
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:04,802
It's a matter of time before
these bastards kill someone.

220
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,389
I agree, but do
you have a solution

221
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:08,410
- or just a lecture?
- Give me the time I asked for

222
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,300
to decrypt the data
and restore the network.

223
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,305
You're not gonna
be able to restore...

224
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:14,049
- How do you know?
- I've never seen it done.

225
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:15,405
I'm not running...

226
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:19,541
Stop, stop, stop, stop. Enough.

227
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:22,480
Your solutions aren't
mutually exclusive.

228
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:24,469
You, keep negotiating,
and you do whatever you do

229
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,611
to get the network back online.

230
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,892
We have some good news.

231
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:37,157
Your cancer hasn't returned.

232
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:41,031
You have a fungal infection that
is causing a bleed in your left lung.

233
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,591
- That's great.
- No, it's not.

234
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:45,138
The best treatment is surgical
excision of the infected lobe,

235
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,231
but we can't do that
because of scarring

236
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:49,867
from the Bleomycin you were
treated with during chemotherapy.

237
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:53,209
They always do this
good cop, bad cop thing?

238
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:57,640
Um, I'm sorry, Dr. Murphy just
has a more direct bedside manner.

239
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,413
That's good. I like direct.

240
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:02,182
You can't climb an obstacle
until you're facing it head-on.

241
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:04,451
We're going to start you
on an anti-fungal drug.

242
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:07,323
Well, if surgery is the
best, that is what I want.

243
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:12,027
The chemo was
over ten years ago.

244
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:14,567
Bleomycin weakens
the lungs permanently.

245
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:15,693
For most people.

246
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,535
I climbed five of the Seven
Summits with these lungs.

247
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:22,602
It's my decision. I
want the surgery.

248
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,169
I'm sorry,

249
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,771
but sometimes a positive
attitude just isn't enough.

250
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:31,284
We may have to try you
on several different drugs

251
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:34,185
before we see some improvement,
so you're gonna have to be patient.

252
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:37,919
It's not one of my strengths.

253
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:38,991
Me neither.

254
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:41,859
But we're gonna get
through this together.

255
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,404
Turkey, avocado and Swiss on
wheat bread with mayonnaise.

256
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,699
- It's your favorite.
- I don't have time.

257
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:58,009
Low blood sugar can decrease
your ability to concentrate.

258
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:00,342
I've had five energy drinks
and three granola bars.

259
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:01,413
Okay.

260
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:07,684
I have an interesting patient.

261
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:10,485
He said he thought
cancer made him stronger,

262
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:12,457
- but that is obviously not true...
- Shaun!

263
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,190
Would you walk in on Glassman

264
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:20,427
while he's doing brain
surgery, offer him a sandwich,

265
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,128
and start telling
him about your day?

266
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:23,835
That's different.

267
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:26,465
Of course.

268
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:29,532
Because his job's
important and mine's not.

269
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:35,072
You have any idea how insulting
it is to hear you demean what I do?

270
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:38,641
Just like every man I've worked
under and over my whole career?

271
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:40,917
You...

272
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:43,684
You don't respect me.

273
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:50,321
You can't bring
sandwiches into an O.R.

274
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:02,467
I have to go.

275
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:11,449
Ah. Heh.

276
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:12,751
King me.

277
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:13,819
Oh.

278
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:18,485
We have a problem.

279
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:21,655
Am I too sick for
the transplant?

280
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:25,022
No. But you are.

281
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:29,401
Your bloodwork indicates
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

282
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:31,938
It's a minor case which
should be manageable with diet,

283
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:35,372
but it means you
can't be a liver donor.

284
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:42,077
Wouldn't a fatty liver
be better than nothing?

285
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:43,844
It wouldn't be safe
for either of you.

286
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:48,420
There has to be another
way. We can't give up.

287
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:50,480
We're not giving up, but...

288
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,688
Thank you for trying to help me.

289
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:01,857
I'm sorry you're sick too.

290
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:17,244
Your kidney is fine. Would
you be willing to donate it?

291
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:21,185
Uh, of course, but how
does that help Jamie?

292
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:24,355
You might be able to save
two lives with one kidney.

293
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:29,623
What's going on?

294
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,926
Blood oxygen level
dropping. He's hypoxic.

295
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:36,126
Yeah, the anti-fungal
regimen isn't working,

296
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:38,162
but don't worry, there
are other drugs we can try.

297
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:41,140
I want the surgery. Please.
I'll take the risk, whatever it is.

298
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:44,700
It's not a risk, it's a guarantee.
Increase voriconazole by 320 milligrams

299
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,837
and add Amphotericin
at 24 milligrams.

300
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:49,815
- We may need to intubate you...
- Stop! Stop.

301
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,151
- I would survive the surgery.
- No, you...

302
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:55,882
Yes. I would.

303
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:58,452
Because I never had the drug...

304
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:02,822
Because I never had cancer.

305
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,543
So how'd he lose his leg?

306
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:20,978
Drunken motorcycle
accident when he was 22.

307
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:22,447
It's good news.

308
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:27,450
Now we can give him
the surgery he needs.

309
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,716
No way. He needs
to find new doctors,

310
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:31,917
and we need to figure out
a way to alert the charity.

311
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:35,391
He faked cancer so
he could steal money,

312
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,828
date models, and get his
face on a Wheaties box.

313
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:40,389
He didn't steal the money.
He gave it all to charity.

314
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:41,832
I don't care what he did with it

315
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:44,166
after he lied and cheated
thousands of people to get it.

316
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:46,206
He should be in
prison, not our O.R.

317
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:48,241
Can we even do that?
Refuse to treat him?

318
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:51,300
We refuse to treat
noncompliant patients all the time.

319
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:52,538
What's going on?

320
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:55,343
I mean, he's obviously not
the first patient who's lied to you.

321
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:59,917
He didn't just hide how
much he smokes or drinks.

322
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:01,921
He weaponized people's empathy,

323
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:05,220
and he kept pushing his lie until
he was some sort of national hero.

324
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,302
- How does that not piss you off?
- It does.

325
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:09,488
But I can be pissed
off and professional.

326
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:14,524
Get him prepped for surgery.

327
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,097
A multi-organ chain.

328
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:22,641
We need to find someone
who wants to give a kidney

329
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:26,702
to their loved one, but isn't a
match, but is a match to Jamie.

330
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,557
And the loved one has
to be a match to Rachel.

331
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:30,777
We have to match
blood and tissue types

332
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,079
as well as organ size.

333
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,351
And kidneys and livers have
different test requirements.

334
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,340
And we need another
donor willing to do a surgery

335
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,189
that's more painful and
dangerous than the one

336
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,420
- they already signed up for.
- Twice the challenge.

337
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:42,325
To save twice as many lives.

338
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:45,355
Park and I will start
calling hospitals.

339
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:48,526
Asher, back to social media stalking.
Jordan, check local news reports

340
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:50,934
and any other corner of
the Internet you can scour.

341
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,208
Stay back or you're gonna
contaminate my clean room.

342
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,144
I found an error.
Not theirs. Ours.

343
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:09,882
The serial numbers on
the servers didn't match up.

344
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:12,790
Turns out one of my techs
spilled coffee on a server,

345
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,087
didn't want to tell me,

346
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,789
so he switched it out
three days before the hack.

347
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:19,263
His screw-up might
just save our ass.

348
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:22,999
So it's not encrypted?

349
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:26,665
No. But it is corrupted from
the coffee and dust and dirt.

350
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:30,176
I found it under a pile of
junk in the recycling bin.

351
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:32,575
But if my patient pulls through,

352
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:34,204
I'll be able to
restore the network

353
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,613
without having to pay
the hackers a dime.

354
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,052
- Wow, that's great.
- Yeah.

355
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:49,593
The insurance guy came to an
agreement with the hackers, didn't he?

356
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:56,664
Actually, he negotiated them down
below the original ransom amount.

357
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:01,734
I didn't authorize it yet.

358
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:06,777
You have till 9 a.m.
to get us back online.

359
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:09,514
Okay.

360
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:17,020
We will get one more chest C.T.

361
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:19,524
and then we will insert
the central venous line

362
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:22,824
and the arterial line to
finalize your surgical prep.

363
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:26,589
You must think I'm a sociopath,

364
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,157
- but I'm...
- Don't even bother.

365
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:33,339
It's not like I planned this
all out. It just... happened.

366
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:37,867
You just forgot the drunk
driving on a motorcycle detail

367
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:40,640
while you raked in cash
and collected famous friends?

368
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:44,476
I went back to school.

369
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:48,412
I got my MBA in
Non-profit Finance.

370
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:53,286
My first interview
after graduation

371
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,555
was with this small
cancer charity and...

372
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:02,191
for some reason the woman
assumed I lost my leg to cancer.

373
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:06,162
And I didn't correct her.

374
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:12,311
It was a weak, stupid moment.

375
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,204
It wasn't just a moment.

376
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:18,377
It was years.

377
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:20,647
Where I was raising money,

378
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,656
helping thousands
of cancer survivors.

379
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:27,959
And I knew if the truth
came out, that would all end.

380
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:33,524
I have helped far more
people over the last ten years

381
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,158
than I have hurt.

382
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:43,006
You're scheduled for surgery
first thing in the morning.

383
00:20:58,624 --> 00:20:59,717
Hey, what's going on?

384
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:00,987
Hey.

385
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:04,361
Don't you have a
thoracotomy to prep for?

386
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,730
Yeah, I just... needed a break.

387
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:11,562
I'm fine.

388
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:15,030
"I'm fine" is a pretty
reliable indicator

389
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,008
that someone is not fine.

390
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:27,212
I suck at this.

391
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:32,187
I completely froze,
could've killed the patient.

392
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:34,727
I always freeze. Lim knows it.

393
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:39,130
I feel like an impostor
because... I am.

394
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,591
It's a stressful job.

395
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:47,528
Patient's being a
jerk? Get used to it.

396
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:49,871
Chief of Surgery
doesn't appreciate you?

397
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:51,342
Earn her respect.

398
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,208
If you want to be a
successful surgeon,

399
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:54,770
you gotta develop thicker skin.

400
00:21:54,847 --> 00:21:57,476
- My skin's not the...
- Suck it up and get back to work.

401
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:19,665
I did it! If I had a mic, I'd
drop it. I fixed the server.

402
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:22,401
It's still missing the
last 96 days of records,

403
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:23,999
but it's totally malware-free,

404
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:26,705
which means we can
restore the network with...

405
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:28,606
three hours to spare.

406
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:32,883
And the, uh... the bot worm,
the thing on the imaging?

407
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:35,820
- How did you get rid of that?
- I didn't. But I don't have to,

408
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:38,824
because I went through every line
of code and there's no sign of a worm.

409
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:40,985
They were obviously bluffing.

410
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,426
Obviously? It's
not obvious to me.

411
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:44,622
No, the cyber
insurance rep was right.

412
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:47,599
These guys are amateurs.
And the level of skill it would take

413
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:50,033
to cause an offline
machine to self-destruct?

414
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:53,038
They'd have to be, like, the
Sidney Crosby of hackers.

415
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:54,801
And they're beer league at best.

416
00:22:58,344 --> 00:22:59,607
Are you sure?

417
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,980
Totally.

418
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:05,314
Ninety-five percent.

419
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:11,247
Okay. Well... Yeah.

420
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:13,383
You have three hours
to get to a hundred.

421
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:19,758
It's not going to
work. I already tried.

422
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,996
Why would the hack
affect the microwave?

423
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,263
- It's a smart microwave.
- Apparently not.

424
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:26,805
Why are you so
angry about Cort's lies?

425
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:29,467
You told me before: when
the truth can't help someone,

426
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:30,565
you should lie.

427
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:34,102
I was talking about small
white lies. Cort's lies are huge.

428
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:37,206
When does a lie stop being
white and start being huge?

429
00:23:37,283 --> 00:23:38,615
The amount of good Cort did

430
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:40,676
was proportional
to the size of his lies.

431
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,745
Looks like you got
what you wanted.

432
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:45,791
I just got off the
phone with a reporter.

433
00:23:45,858 --> 00:23:48,657
She wanted a comment on
her soon-to-be front-page exposé

434
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:49,854
on Cort Graham.

435
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:55,929
Because her source is an
employee in my department.

436
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,799
- I mean, I didn't...
- You're off the case.

437
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:01,841
And you're lucky I
can't prove it was you,

438
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:03,205
or you'd be out of a job.

439
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:25,056
- What? Crap.
- It's okay. I got someone.

440
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:27,091
I called an old buddy

441
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,166
who runs the infirmary at
the state pen in Arizona.

442
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:30,863
He put me in touch
with an ex-inmate,

443
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:33,405
just paroled on compassionate
release for kidney failure.

444
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:36,806
He's a match for Rachel, his
daughter's a match for Jamie.

445
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,715
They're on their way
here with a police escort.

446
00:24:38,744 --> 00:24:41,771
ETA twenty minutes. The
chain is closed. We did it.

447
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:48,948
Not to be a buzzkill,
but an ex-inmate?

448
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,219
What'd he do?

449
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:54,985
He killed someone?

450
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:58,628
It was a complicated
case. Over 20 years ago.

451
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:00,461
- He's paid his debt...
- I can't do this.

452
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:03,126
You're not doing it for him,
you're doing it for Jamie,

453
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:06,161
who's an innocent and deserving
woman the system failed.

454
00:25:07,106 --> 00:25:08,836
I understand.

455
00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:14,580
But you want to put my
kidney in a murderer's body.

456
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:18,105
He's a person who did
something wrong a long time ago.

457
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:20,519
It's more than just wrong.

458
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:29,851
I'm not going to risk my life to
help someone who took another's.

459
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:35,399
Please take this I.V.
out of my arm. Now.

460
00:25:43,342 --> 00:25:46,835
I get it. I wouldn't want to
save a murderer's life either.

461
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,575
But you should understand what
Dr. Park means by "complicated."

462
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:58,385
Chris was abused as a
child. Sexually, physically...

463
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,193
You don't want to
know the horrors.

464
00:26:01,527 --> 00:26:05,862
Once he got strong enough,
he put a stop to it. With a bullet.

465
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:11,170
But the prosecutor and the
jury didn't see a brutalized kid,

466
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,437
they just saw a thug.

467
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:18,107
So they put him away
for life, for fighting back.

468
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:24,843
All finished. You're free to go.

469
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:36,359
That man shot
someone in a robbery.

470
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,363
If the lie saves a
life, it's fine by me.

471
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,454
It saves two lives,

472
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:41,693
so I definitely think
we can let it slide.

473
00:26:43,502 --> 00:26:45,528
I think I've actually
solved a huge problem,

474
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,869
but Glassman wants me
to be 100 percent sure,

475
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,203
and I can't be.

476
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:52,234
I need your advice.

477
00:27:04,223 --> 00:27:05,555
If I'm wrong,

478
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,650
all the imaging machines
in the entire hospital

479
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:08,853
will self-destruct,

480
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:11,123
tens of millions of
dollars' worth of damage.

481
00:27:11,497 --> 00:27:14,126
But if I'm right, I'd
save the whole hospital

482
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:15,724
and prevent some
really bad people

483
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:17,394
from getting almost $2 million.

484
00:27:18,904 --> 00:27:20,304
And I'm almost sure I'm right.

485
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,502
I'm never 100 percent sure

486
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:27,808
a surgery is going
to cure the patient.

487
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:31,340
There's always a chance
something could go wrong,

488
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:33,180
but I still do the surgery.

489
00:27:33,252 --> 00:27:35,278
But you get the
patient's permission first.

490
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:37,232
And in my case, Glassman
is kind of the patient,

491
00:27:37,256 --> 00:27:40,192
and he hasn't given me
permission. In fact, he told me not to.

492
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:43,058
- Then I wouldn't do the surgery.
- But this isn't actually surgery.

493
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:45,154
I don't know what
you want me to say.

494
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:52,135
It's all right. Sorry. I'll just
figure it out on my own.

495
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:56,802
Lea?

496
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:02,972
I wouldn't bring Dr. Glassman
a sandwich in the O.R.

497
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:04,914
because you can't
eat in the O.R.

498
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,386
I knew that because
I know about surgery.

499
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:11,685
I don't know about computers.
Neither does Dr. Glassman.

500
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:14,692
But you do.

501
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:19,797
You always know
how to fix things.

502
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,628
I respect you.

503
00:28:33,345 --> 00:28:35,145
I would've thought you
would respect me enough

504
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,460
to at least ask me the question.

505
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:38,677
To hear me out before
kicking me off the case

506
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,695
- and threatening to fire me.
- I did hear you out.

507
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,565
You sat right there and said you
wanted to blow the whistle on a patient.

508
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:45,490
And then that's
exactly what happened.

509
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:48,589
- What am I supposed to think?
- You're supposed to trust me.

510
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:52,592
I thought we were friends.

511
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:56,634
Is that why you went over my head
to tell my boss about my diagnosis?

512
00:28:56,702 --> 00:28:58,193
- Is that what this is about?
- No.

513
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,296
I'm capable of separating
my personal feelings

514
00:29:00,372 --> 00:29:01,965
from my professional decisions.

515
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,009
Excuse me

516
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:05,809
Yeah, what is it?

517
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:09,439
Sorry. Cort just coded. We had to
do CPR and manual cardiac massage.

518
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:11,813
Dr. Murphy didn't wanna
start the lobectomy without...

519
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:13,112
I'll assist Dr. Murphy.

520

Would you really
fire Dr. Browne?

541
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:28,144
If I find evidence
she did it, I will.

542
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,311
Shingle the ribs.

543
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:32,722
But you and Claire are friends.

544
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:35,886
Professional responsibilities
come before friendships.

545
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:42,631
It wasn't Dr. Browne.

546
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:48,169
It was me. I
called the reporter.

547
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:51,399
Why?

548
00:31:52,711 --> 00:31:54,475
People suffered real tragedies

549
00:31:54,546 --> 00:31:56,640
and he used their
pain to enrich himself.

550
00:31:57,349 --> 00:31:59,375
But why confess?

551
00:32:03,455 --> 00:32:06,152
You're the kind of
person I aspire to be.

552
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:08,420
So is Dr. Browne.

553
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,920
And if you two lost
trust in each other,

554
00:32:11,997 --> 00:32:14,398
it would do a lot of
damage to this department...

555
00:32:15,801 --> 00:32:17,394
to what makes it so special.

556
00:32:20,372 --> 00:32:22,534
I didn't want to be
responsible for that.

557
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:31,682
Scrub out.

558
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:45,127
Stapler.

559
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:49,692
Transecting the
bronchial branches.

560
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:09,175
Stop! Stop! Stop!

561
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:13,579
Please tell me you haven't
made the transfer yet.

562
00:34:13,652 --> 00:34:15,416
No, but I'm authorizing it.

563
00:34:15,487 --> 00:34:16,511
Turn your computer on.

564
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:19,090
Your employee ID is
your temp password.

565
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,655
Who knows their
employee ID number?

566
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:25,094
I remotely rebooted
every authorized user.

567
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:29,032
Totally. One hundred
percent. Successfully.

568
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:34,370
Imaging's unscathed. No
malware. No worm. No nothing.

569
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:37,170
Bastards were obviously
bluffing, just like I told you.

570
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:40,212
You gambled your entire
imaging department on a hunch?

571
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:42,677
You have any idea
how reckless that was?

572
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:47,318
Thank you. I appreciate
all you've done.

573
00:34:54,893 --> 00:34:57,362
That decision was
not yours to make.

574
00:34:57,429 --> 00:35:01,958
If you ever usurp my authority again,
I'm gonna fire you right on the spot.

575
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:05,834
- I'm sorry, but I just saved the whole...
- Will you just...? Shush! For a second!

576
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:08,468
Wait for the compliment.

577
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:14,405
Thank you. Well done.

578
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:18,039
You're welcome.

579
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:21,877
If I ever have another
poker night, you're invited.

580
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:38,293
You'll need to take
all three of these

581
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:39,998
every morning
and before bedtime.

582
00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:46,269
Call me if you need anything.

583
00:35:49,581 --> 00:35:52,415
Thank you for not
giving up on me.

584
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:08,496
You can't just leave.

585
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:10,330
I've never been fired before,

586
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:12,462
but I'm pretty sure
that's how it works.

587
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:14,857
I'll talk to Lim, convince her
to give you a second chance.

588
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:16,898
I do not think she'll do that.

589
00:36:16,975 --> 00:36:18,967
She was willing to fire
you, and she likes you

590
00:36:19,044 --> 00:36:20,603
- a lot more than her.
- Shaun...

591
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:22,807
It's okay.

592
00:36:24,416 --> 00:36:27,215
I've enjoyed working
with you both.

593
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:30,487
Thank you.

594
00:36:34,726 --> 00:36:37,958
If there's anything I can
do, don't hesitate to call.

595
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:48,962
I'll miss you. But I
don't want to hug you.

596
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:04,652
Surgery went well. You'll be back
to competition in a couple of months.

597
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:12,095
Was it you?

598
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:15,691
I... I can't claim credit
for that good deed.

599
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:19,197
Not a terribly
convincing denial.

600
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,671
If I cared about convincing
you, I'd try harder.

601
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:26,010
I knew this day would
eventually come.

602
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:34,016
I expected I'd feel
vulnerable. Exposed.

603
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,348
And I do.

604
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:40,356
But I also didn't expect
that, you know, I'd feel...

605
00:37:40,892 --> 00:37:42,292
relieved.

606
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:48,556
It's a little like getting back
in the water the first time

607
00:37:49,534 --> 00:37:50,797
without my prosthetic.

608
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:56,838
I had to awkwardly
hop to the water,

609
00:37:56,908 --> 00:37:58,240
people staring at me.

610
00:38:00,512 --> 00:38:05,143
But once I got in I...
I felt a little bit lighter.

619
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:37,746
You didn't let me down.

620
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:39,981
You confused me.

621
00:38:42,287 --> 00:38:43,983
I know you're not
the whistleblower.

622
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:47,982
- It wasn't Dr. Browne.
- I know. It was me.

623
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,491
You? Why?

624
00:38:51,563 --> 00:38:53,862

but it's not our only one.

627
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:01,438
I knew there'd be no proof,
so no one was gonna get fired.

628
00:39:02,407 --> 00:39:04,342
I never expected
Lim to blame Browne.

629
00:39:05,944 --> 00:39:10,348
But I know that's not why you
destroyed your whole career here.

630
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,710
- How can I help you...
- I don't want your help.

631
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:16,982
- Livvy...
- I never wanted to be a doctor.

632
00:39:21,593 --> 00:39:27,726
But every time I try to tell my
parents, my professors, you,

633
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:32,601
you just push me and
encourage me until I back down.

634
00:39:33,638 --> 00:39:35,800
I knew if I got myself fired,

635
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:37,638
there was no way that
you could pep-talk me

636
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:39,610
back into a career
that I don't want.

637
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:45,142
I don't want to be
important or successful.

638
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,741
I just want to be myself.

639
00:39:48,987 --> 00:39:50,819
But I don't even
know who that is.

00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:57,293

00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:01,350
I was wrong to accuse you.

653
00:41:01,426 --> 00:41:04,828

but because I was holding against you

you such an awesome doctor...

00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:12,836

656
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:18,874
When you meet a patient,

657
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:21,845
you don't just see
muscles, bones, and organs,

658
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:25,247
you see a human being with
all of their strengths and flaws.

659
00:41:26,351 --> 00:41:29,753
And you should never lose that.
Even if it does make the job harder.

you're a good friend.
