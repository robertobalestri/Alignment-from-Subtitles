1
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:09,065
Bet that burned some calories.

2
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:11,577
Almost as good as a
session of hot yoga.

3
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:14,012
With considerably
fewer wind chimes.

4
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,322
You forgot your phone charger.

5
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:28,021
Leave it for next time.

6
00:00:28,996 --> 00:00:31,056
Since when did you start
counting on a next time?

7
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:34,863
Since last time we went three
rounds. But if you want to stop...

8
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:36,267
I didn't say that.

9
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:38,362
I recall you saying
quite the opposite.

10
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:40,805
I want you not to depend
on this being here for you.

11
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,036
Thinking you can plug
in anytime you want.

12
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,205
I'm aware that I need
the charger's consent.

13
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,516
You need to see other women.

14
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:51,313
- Why? I don't want to...
- No excuses.

15
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:52,853
If we're going to
keep hooking up,

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,821
you should start
sleeping with other people.

17
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,053
You are a very strange woman.

18
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,555
Have you seen my phone?

19
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,031
Oh, and remember we
have to leave the hospital

20
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:09,660
by 6:00 tonight
for birthing class.

21
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,705
The birthing class
that I don't need

22
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:14,606
on account of my OB
rotation in medical school.

23
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:22,178
But where I will learn how to
give you the support you need

24
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:24,150
while giving birth to our child.

25
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:26,245
That is my guy.

26
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:34,923
I got the results of
the fetal DNA test.

27
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:37,263
Okay.

28
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,964
This will tell us
the sex of the baby.

29
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:44,266
I know, on account of my
OB rotation in medical school.

30
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:45,863
Aren't you excited?

31
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,100
Not by that.

32
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:51,668
There are only two outcomes
that can be detected on this test.

33
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:54,909
- And I'm fine with either.
- So am I.

34
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:58,109
I... I'm excited
to find this out.

35
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:00,416
Please come here so
we can look together.

36
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:18,394
It's a girl. We're
having a girl.

37
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:22,676
Would you like to
paint the nursery pink?

38
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:27,481
No. This isn't the '50s.

39
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:33,818
- Okay.
- Okay!

40
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:38,356
Okay.

41
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:42,487
- Okay. I will see you in class.
- Okay. Okay.

42
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:01,943
I've got bay three.

43
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,541
- The chest contusion?
- Uh-huh.

44
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:07,710
Why are you all bright-eyed
and bushy-tailed over a bruise?

45
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:16,992
This is Dr. Wolke,
I'm Dr. Reznick.

46
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:21,024
- Tell me how you got that contusion, Mr...
- Bradley "The Body" Vargas.

47
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:23,002
Currently top-ranked in
his MMA Weight Class.

48
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,562
I've seen all of your
fights, you're amazing.

49
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:28,973
So much for slipping in and out
of here without being recognized.

50
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,139
Sparring. Roundhouse
right to the chest.

51
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,705
That was some kick.

52
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:38,718
This is a pretty large
hematoma. We need to drain it.

53
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:44,518
You're already training for Vasquez?
That fight's not for a couple months.

54
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,225
A real fan.

55
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:49,326
Drain it, like, with a needle?

56
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,865
- We can numb you if you like.
- Get that away from me!

57
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:58,904
Not here.

58
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:05,111
Your pre-op tests
came back normal.

59
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:07,738
So we can go ahead
with the hip replacement.

60
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:11,649
My physical therapist says I should
be walking four hours after surgery

61
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:15,450
and good to go in 10 to 12
weeks, but I'm aiming for nine.

62
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:18,287
Can you please tell my
mom that's not a good idea?

63
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,190
You should not
rush your recovery.

64
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,163
Does it matter to you whether
you are having a boy or a girl?

65
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,663
I'm having a boy.

66
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,635
We're going to name
him Ray, after my dad.

67
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:33,806
My girlfriend and I are
going have a daughter.

68
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:35,399
That's great news, Shaun.

69
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:37,409
Why?

70
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:41,739
The procedure will
take a couple of hours,

71
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:44,046
so we should be able to
get you home in a day or two.

72
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:48,054
Oh, I'm looking forward to
getting back in the air, pain-free.

73
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,114
No more pills or
cortisone shots or...

74
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:55,859
my internist telling me my
hips are too wide for the cockpit.

75
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:59,195
Well, sounds more like a Navy
problem than a you problem.

76
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:01,801
Clearly the cockpit
needs a redesign...

77
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:03,960
as well as a renaming.

78
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:07,633
OR-2 is ready, it's time.

79
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,673
Both implants seem to be intact.

80
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:17,483
Thanks.

81
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:21,312
Sorry I freaked out. Too
many people back there.

82
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:25,553
If my fans found out I had pec
implants, my career would be over.

83
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:29,858
I saw you make Miguin tap in one round.
Implants had nothing to do with that.

84
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:33,863
My body's a big part of the
brand. Everything else is real.

85
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:36,665
One hundred percent
U.S. prime Bradley.

86
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:38,398
You do not need
to explain anything.

87
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:40,139
It's just...

88
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:44,942
How many guys, let alone
fighters, get plastic surgery?

89
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,741
I'm sure more than you think.

90
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,475
When I was a kid...
well, I was a big boy.

91
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:52,914
I got picked on all the time.

92
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,355
My mom wanted me to
be able to protect myself,

93
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:58,016
so she put me in jiu-jitsu.

94
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:02,625
I loved it. Started
training every day.

95
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,255
Seems to have worked.

96
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:07,333
Yeah. Well, after
the fat was gone.

97
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,732
Man boobs don't
look good on anyone.

98
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:14,365
They did very nice
work. I would never know.

99
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:23,039
We still need to drain it.

100
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,278
I'll get the procedure
room set up.

101
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:32,638
Is that why you want me
to sleep with other people?

102
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:35,127
- So you can shamelessly flirt?
- I feel no shame.

103
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:38,893
And I'm not stopping you. So
why do I need to see other women?

104
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,934
This is embarrassing, for you.

105
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:45,302
What man asks that question?

106
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:49,605
- You're soft and prone to attachment.
- I promise you I will not get attached.

107
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:52,145
Empty words. You have
a Bumble profile, use it.

108
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:55,205
No need. What's going to keep
me from getting attached to you

109
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:58,480
isn't the charms of other
women, it's your utter lack of any.

110
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:09,387
Nice osteotomy of
the femoral head.

111
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:12,529
It's bone on bone in here.

112
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,761
I don't know how Jean
pushed through the pain.

113
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:18,100
A female fighter pilot in the <i>Top
Gun</i> era, she's pushed through worse.

114
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,837
Things are much
better for women today.

115
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,279
In this surgery, I
am the only man.

116
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:30,778
But until they find a way
to put uteruses in men,

117
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:34,617
biology will always force us to make
sacrifices our male colleagues don't.

118
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:36,714
Is that why you
don't have children?

119
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:40,785
Shaun, that is not something
you should ever ask a woman.

120
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,860
Oh, I brought it up.

121
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,223
I never consciously
made that decision.

122
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,358
But along the away, I
made a bunch of small ones

123
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:50,268
that put my job in front
of having a family and...

124
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,471
I don't regret it.

125
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:55,733
But it does piss me off that
most men don't have to choose.

126
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,745
Mobilize the proximal
femur then ream and rasp.

127
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,924
- Jean's pressure just tanked, 64 over 38.
- Push fluids, start pressors.

128
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,756
Heart rate's low at
42. Sinus bradycardia.

129
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:17,355
Her pre-op tests were all
normal. She has no cardiac history.

130
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,594
If she threw a clot, she'd be
tachy. Check for any occult bleeding.

131
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,295
I'll get a transesophageal echo.

132
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:26,164
There is no bleeding.

133
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,235
Check a 12-lead,
start troponins.

134
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:31,676
Her BP's stabilizing.

135
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:38,879
Remove osteophytes, place
cup, direct screws posterolaterally.

136
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:40,818
Her pressure should
not have dropped.

137
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,152
And we don't know
why it came back up.

138
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:46,159
Was it the fluids and pressors
or spontaneous reversal or...

139
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:47,990
We need to finish
her hip arthroplasty

140
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:50,087
before she bottoms
out again and then, yes,

141
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:52,098
we need to figure
out why it happened.

142
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:56,702
Right.

143
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:01,001
Go ahead and advance the needle.

144
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:08,545
Are you seeing anybody?

145
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:11,210
Oh, no. Is this
about to get weird?

146
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:12,843
No. No.

147
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,879
Taking a fluoro shot.

148
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,951
Do you usually date
one person exclusively

149
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,927
or are you seeing a
few people at once?

150
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:24,397
Careful not to breach
the pleural space.

151
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:31,098
Define your terms, does "date" mean
have dinner with or meet up for sex?

152
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,139
I'm not entirely sure.

153
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:38,309
By the time there's food
involved, I prefer to be exclusive.

154
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:40,142
In the hematoma now.

155
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:44,783
I'm not able to
aspirate anything.

156
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:47,582
It's not just clotted
blood. It's a mass.

157
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:53,917
It's about five centimeters across.
Firm, nonmobile, it's very dense.

158
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,892
Get a biopsy. But that...

159
00:09:58,731 --> 00:09:59,790
looks like breast cancer.

160
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:12,409
There might be a problem with her
heart. Should she be putting strain on it?

161
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,609
If I'm going to have a heart
attack, this is the best place for it.

162
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:17,014
That is exactly right.

163
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,355
It's very likely
your mom is fine,

164
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:25,085
that the blood pressure drop
is a reaction to the anesthesia.

165
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:29,519
You're a very successful pilot. Was
that harder because you are a woman?

166
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:33,425
For me, standing out was
a plus. It got me noticed.

167
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:36,363
That's not always a good thing.

168
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:40,897
It's the Navy. Was the bar
higher for me than the guys? Yeah.

169
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:44,672
But pressure's just an
opportunity to get better.

170
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:48,778
Your mother is very inspiring.

171
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:53,914
Yes. She is.

172
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:57,981
I can go harder
if you need me to.

173
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:00,692
Yes, please.

174
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:06,789
I don't have breasts.

175
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,396
How can I have breast cancer?

176
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:12,769
You have breast tissue. While
it's rare in men, it does happen.

177
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,570
The biopsy has identified a
particularly aggressive tumor,

178
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:17,440
but the good news
is we caught it early.

179
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,215
What's next?

180
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:27,647
Sorry.

181
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:34,319
We're recommending surgery to remove
the mass, followed by chemotherapy.

182
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:37,006
We don't believe there will be
any long term loss of strength or...

183
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:41,024
Can I keep my implants? Will
they be able to work around them?

184
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,262
- It's possible.
- But highly unlikely.

185
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:50,708
At the end of this, The Body
gotta look like The Body.

186
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:55,474
Otherwise, I'll lose my
sponsors. My career.

187
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:02,015
A lumpectomy makes
sense, considering...

188
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:05,149
If you want to let the patient prioritize
his appearance over his health.

189
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,336
- He needs a mastectomy.
- Would you be that dismissive

190
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,320
if our patient was a woman
choosing to preserve...

191
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:11,263
Someone's popular today.

192
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,923
They're all dating app alerts.

193
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,299
It's amazing what
upgrading a profile pic can do.

194
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:17,860
You should vary
your password more.

195
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,104
Where'd you get this photo?

196
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,906
I took it for personal use.

197
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:29,279
I'm happy to let it be your
introduction to the world of e-dating.

198
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,408
Fly, muscular sparrow. Fly.

199
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,819
This photo is such...

200
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:37,789
The words you're looking for are
"thirst trap," and you're welcome.

201
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,566
<i>Relax. Relax.</i>

202
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:51,835
While you are under the
soothing touch of your partner,

203
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:55,141
let's discuss birthing plans.

204
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:58,968
Okay, maybe just a
little less pressure?

205
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:00,946
Like this?

206
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:02,705
Not really.

207
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:06,651
Remember, you are in charge
of your birthing experience.

208
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:09,814
Every aspect of your
labor is your decision.

209
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,616
Starting with when
you head to the hospital.

210
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,989
Okay. Maybe just
stop. It's okay. It's okay.

211
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:19,726
I recommend what
doulas call the 4-1-1 Rule.

212
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,895
You wait until contractions are four
minutes apart and last for one minute

213
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,236
- for at least...
- Five-minute intervals is safer.

214
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,776
That's one opinion, Dr. Murphy,

215
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:32,607
for mothers who enjoy
waiting at the hospital.

216
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:37,149
Once you arrive, clearly instruct
your partner and your doctor

217
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:38,445
- of what you want.
- No.

218
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:42,785
The doctor needs to be in charge.
What if there's a complication?

219
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:44,880
Maybe just let her talk.

220
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,484
Sorry.

221
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:53,725
After your water breaks, fortify
yourself for the work ahead.

222
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,293
Be that with meditation
or a pre-selected song

223
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:00,204
that you find soothing,
or perhaps a light snack.

224
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:01,502
That is a very bad idea.

225
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:04,544
Dr. Murphy, please hold
your comments until the...

226
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,442
You shouldn't eat
after your water breaks.

227
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,505
Many women experience
bowel incontinence during labor.

228
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,345
Is that true?

229
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:15,350
- We might poop ourselves?
- Okay.

230
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:17,014
No one mentioned
involuntary pooping.

231
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,363
- How was the class?
- Very informative.

232
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:31,563
When's the next one?

233
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:33,731
There won't be a next
one. We were thrown out.

234
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,709
None of our tests showed
any issues with your heart.

235
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:40,007
You are in great shape.

236
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,011
Then what caused the
blood pressure drop?

237
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:48,214
Dr. Browne must have been right.
It was a reaction to the anesthesia.

238
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:49,880
So when can I get out of here?

239
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:53,188
When we know you can get
around safely on your new hip.

240
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,159
Oh. Let's do this.

241
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:16,082
Careful, Mom. It's not a race.

242
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:18,483
Everything's a race, dear.

243
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:22,285
Mom!

244
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:37,900
Jean's hip is intact. Which
means it didn't cause her fall.

245
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,439
No. Her blood pressure did.

246
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:42,975
Jean was still being
monitored when she collapsed.

247
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:45,341
Her blood pressure fall
precipitously, like in surgery.

248
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:51,280
Sudden hypotensive crisis
could be a high spinal cord tumor.

249
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:55,287
Or carotid stenosis, or
carotid sinus hypersensitivity.

250
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,351
Endocrine deficiency?

251
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,318
Make a list. Start
ruling things out.

252
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,866
Make a list somewhere else.

253
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:27,315
Shaun!

254
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:30,446
Come meet Theresa.

255
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,791
She's a doula and we're talking
about her helping me during my labor.

256
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:41,059
Hello. Lea does not need a doula.
I will be helping her, but thank you.

257
00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:46,896
- Let me know what you decide.
- Of course. Thank you.

258
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:48,573
All right.

259
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:57,710
Shaun, I am so
excited about our baby,

260
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:01,151
and I'm so scared about
delivering her. It's going to hurt.

261
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,416
- It could go on for hours...
- Possibly over a day.

262
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:07,352
And I need to know that I
can have whatever I need.

263
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:10,829
A massage at exactly
the right pressure.

264
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:13,728
A hand to squeeze really hard.

265
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:17,235
- A cool wet washcloth.
- Oh.

266
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:19,101
Or a warm wet washcloth.

267
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:22,673
Can you do that?

268
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:27,413
I can get better at massages.

269
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:32,712
I'm sure you can, but those aren't
really your strengths, are they?

270
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:41,592
It's... just a setup for failure and
I know neither of us wants that.

271
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:46,389
No. We don't.

272
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:47,465
Yeah.

273
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:56,067
Dr. Park.

274
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:57,976
Dr. Boheim.

275
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:03,782
I definitely do not know this
because it's completely confidential,

276
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:08,344
but hypothetically, if you were
treating MMA Rockstar Bradley Vargas,

277
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,822
and if I had a
10-year-old patient

278
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,553
who would go bananas
for a signed photo...

279
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:15,554
I'll see what I can do.

280
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,598
Thanks in advance for the
autograph. It'll make a 10-year-old's day.

281
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:29,639
- No.
- What?

282
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:30,733
She's all wrong.

283
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:33,811
She's a peds resident.

284
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:37,379
They're all kind and nurturing
and they care about things.

285
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,284
And she obviously wants you to
keep all your chargers at her house.

286
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:44,686
That's not what you need.
You need fun. Text the redhead.

287
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,659
- What redhead?
- Candace309.

288
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:53,257
Change your password
to something I can't guess.

289
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:04,075
No tumors in the
frontal or parietal lobes.

290
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,477
Next, we should check for a
glial-based tumor in the brain stem.

291
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,310
Squeeze my hand
as hard as you can.

292
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,118
Lea said she may need to do that
during labor. I want to be prepared.

293
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:28,633
Okay. Okay, that's enough.

294
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:32,737
We need a better look
in the high cervical cord.

295
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,969
Is Lea feeling
nervous about labor?

296
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:41,273
She thinks she needs a doula
to support her, but she doesn't.

297
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:44,249
You squeezed my hand
very hard. I can take it.

298
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,943
I think there's probably going
to be more to it than that, Shaun.

299
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:52,917
I've also looked into
antimicrobial options for washcloths

300
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:54,085
to wipe her forehead.

301
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:57,095
What else?

302
00:19:58,764 --> 00:19:59,764
I don't know.

303
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:04,262
Neither do you, or Lea,
or the doctor, or the doula.

304
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:05,964
That's what's
terrifying about it.

305
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,235
It's the biggest
day of her life.

306
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:10,833
And the only thing
you know for sure

307
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,971
is that another human being is
going to force its way out of you.

308
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:21,779
High cervical cord is clear.

309
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:32,560
Breathe.

310
00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:37,170
Good. You're almost there.

311
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,933
The lighting in this
room is very harsh.

312
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:42,133
We didn't call for a
surgical consult, Dr. Murphy.

313
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,143
I know. I'm here for research.

314
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:47,078
And this is a bad time. Next
contraction, I need you to push.

315
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:49,547
- Okay.
- I am very interested

316
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:51,743
in anything you can share
about your experience.

317
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:55,518
- What are you feeling right now?
- Like...

318
00:20:55,588 --> 00:21:01,550
like he's trying to...
rip out everything!

319
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:03,493
Do you wish you had
gotten an epidural?

320
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:04,621
Yes!

321
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:07,098
It's too late now.

322
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,065
Please page Dr. Glassman.

323
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:18,272
Okay. Good.

324
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:23,776
Lea wants to have a doula.

325
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:28,611
Okay. And... you don't?

326
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:32,748
Research shows that doula-assisted
births have fewer complications,

327
00:21:32,825 --> 00:21:35,818
decreased length of labor, and
increased breast feeding rates.

328
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:38,329
So you do want a doula.

329
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:44,562
No. I can precisely measure
the time between contractions

330
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:47,197
and get the right washcloths,
and I've mapped out

331
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:50,801
the fastest route from the OB
floor to the cafeteria for ice chips.

332
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:53,673
I don't want Lea
to have a doula.

333
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,982
But they are good.

334
00:22:02,588 --> 00:22:04,113
I am very bad at massages.

335
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:12,421
So, you... You want Lea to
have everything that she wants,

336
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:16,196
but you don't want
her to want a doula?

337
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:17,497
Yes.

338
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:21,240
- How do I do that?
- I don't know.

339
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:24,770
I just... It can't be done.

340
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:28,906
It's like you want a red shirt
really badly, but it has to be green.

341
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:33,251
Why can't you just give
her what she needs?

342
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:42,356
Okay, good.

343
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:47,056
We need to expose
the underlying pec major.

344
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:49,863
Dr. Park, gently cut with
microdissection needle.

345
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,865
I really need to join a gym.

346
00:22:53,973 --> 00:22:56,204
I mean, I know I'm never
going to look like The Body,

347
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:59,439
but I could try to look
like I have a body.

348
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:05,909
Raise the flap and be
careful not to thin it too much.

349
00:23:07,286 --> 00:23:09,949
Bradley's transformation is
impressive, but it's not real.

350
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:13,726
Strength, determination, hard
work. Those things are real.

351
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:15,317
And worth striving for.

352
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,862
Not to the
exclusion of all else.

353
00:23:18,664 --> 00:23:22,624
The day I lost my job as chief, I
went home and drank myself to sleep

354
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:23,760
every night for a week.

355
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:27,028
Better to drown my sorrows
than to let my wife see me cry.

356
00:23:27,673 --> 00:23:29,198
When your marriage fell apart,

357
00:23:29,275 --> 00:23:31,506
did you tell a good friend
that you were heartbroken,

358
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:34,775
or did you just hit something
really hard for a long time?

359
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,950
Both are fine. But
men don't do both.

360
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:45,822
I'm guessing no one told you, you
were a real man when you came out.

361
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:49,623
But that took a lot more courage than
getting pummeled inside of an octagon.

362
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:59,296
I can't see any
clear tumor margins.

363
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:02,000
The tumor extends beyond
what was visible on imaging.

364
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:04,400
It was obscured
by the pec implant.

365
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:08,608
Close him up.

366
00:24:09,348 --> 00:24:12,113
We need to wake him and get
his consent for a total mastectomy.

367
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:19,884
I can't go home yet. I still don't
know what's wrong with my patient.

368
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:23,259
- Then why did you ask me to wait?
- This is for you.

369
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:34,897
Okay, this will massage your
shoulders whenever you want

370
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:37,466
at exactly the right pressure.

371
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:39,671
There are three settings
and a pulsing option

372
00:24:39,745 --> 00:24:42,977
which I think would be
irritating, but it is up to you.

373
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:46,678
When I wear this, you can
squeeze as hard as you want.

374
00:24:47,553 --> 00:24:50,421
Also, I have been building
up my washcloth tolerance.

375
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,048
I am up to 15 seconds.

376
00:24:54,126 --> 00:24:55,560
That's great, Shaun.

377
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:59,864
But I decided I want
Theresa there for the birth.

378
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:03,500
It'll make me feel safer
and more comfortable.

379
00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:08,007
I can make you feel
safe and comfortable.

380
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:13,944
I am the father, I am
going to be a good father.

381
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:17,074
- I know that and I believe that.
- You don't need her.

382
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:22,080
Maybe not, but I want her there.

383
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:25,551
It's my body and
my birth experience,

384
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:29,061
and I want to have a doula there
with me, so we're going to have one.

385
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:34,832
I love you.

386
00:25:36,402 --> 00:25:37,563
I'll see you at home.

387
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:47,244
<i>Less than two weeks away,
so don't get too comfortable...</i>

388
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:50,339
The brain and spinal MRI scans
were clear. You don't have a tumor.

389
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:55,352
One less thing to
worry about. What's left?

390
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:57,956
There is still a very long list.

391
00:25:58,023 --> 00:26:02,188
I need to perform a carotid sinus
massage to test for hypersensitivity.

392
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:06,294
I have been working on
my massage technique.

393
00:26:06,365 --> 00:26:07,526
But you may pass out.

394
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:12,167
That's how we know
if the test worked.

395
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:15,105
Elongate your neck and turn your
head 10 degrees away from me.

396
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:25,984
Did you have a doula
when you gave birth?

397
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:31,920
No one I know had a doula
back then, or fancy birthing suites.

398
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:36,553
Or hypno breathing or the luxury
of three months off to recover.

399
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,627
It's not a luxury, Mom.

400
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:45,667
It's important for the
mom and the baby.

401
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:50,907
If women want to
compete, then compete.

402
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,603
We can't ask for special
treatment and then complain

403
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,740
that the playing
field isn't level.

404
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:59,683
I had a long weekend,
and then back in the plane.

405
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:01,885
I didn't have a choice.

406
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,946
You had a choice.

407
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:06,821
- I...
- Stop breathing, please.

408
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:11,590
You always loved to fly.

409
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:16,025
Maybe more than being stuck
on the ground with me and Dad.

410
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:18,665
No.

411
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,540
Okay.

412
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,770
I didn't like leaving
either one of you.

413
00:27:31,517 --> 00:27:35,284
I just wanted you to see me be strong
so you knew you could be strong too.

414
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:39,223
I did.

415
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:48,226
Being... scared and weak, I wasn't
always sure that that was okay.

416
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:55,563
Oh, my God.

417
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:58,273
Wait, is this what was
supposed to happen?

418
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,141
No, this is not
supposed to happen.

419
00:28:12,758 --> 00:28:16,058
You need a total mastectomy
including the removal of your pec implant.

420
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:18,688
But with training, your
strength should fully re...

421
00:28:18,764 --> 00:28:21,859
I can't get back in the octagon
with half of my chest caved in.

422
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:24,299
I'll lose my sponsors.

423
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:27,635
Then find new ones. Once people
know what you've been through...

424
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:31,199
Do you honestly think I'm going to
let anyone know I had breast cancer?

425
00:28:33,145 --> 00:28:36,707
What about non-surgical
options? What about chemo?

426
00:28:36,782 --> 00:28:38,751
Chemo alone isn't the
best way to treat this.

427
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:40,979
It doesn't have to be the
best. It just has to work.

428
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:42,521
There's no guarantee it will.

429
00:28:42,588 --> 00:28:45,251
And given the tumor's invasiveness,
they'll have to use toxic...

430
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:47,589
I can take whatever
you throw at me.

431
00:28:49,528 --> 00:28:51,292
But I'm not having surgery.

432
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:59,400
EEG results are normal.

433
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:04,172
You've never had
a seizure before,

434
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:06,508
but it's possible
one was missed.

435
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,103
There are many different types.

436
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,811
Does Jean ever stare off,

437
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:13,147
- become non-responsive?
- No.

438
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:19,081
No, but there was that
one bathroom episode.

439
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,021
When I came to stay with you.

440
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:24,058
- After Dad died.
- Oh, that was nothing.

441
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:27,699
It was late and she
fell asleep watching TV.

442
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,258
She got up to use the
bathroom and got light-headed

443
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:31,335
and then almost fainted.

444
00:29:32,304 --> 00:29:33,829
I think I was just exhausted.

445
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,472
Did it happen again?

446
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:40,535
Uh, hardly ever. A couple
times over the last few years.

447
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:45,217
There is no mention of
this in your medical record.

448
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:46,877
I told my internist.

449
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:49,444
He said it happens to some
women during menopause.

450
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:54,192
Have you experienced other symptoms
that were attributed to menopause?

451
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:56,422
Of course.

452
00:29:56,495 --> 00:29:58,589
Tell me what they are
and when they started.

453
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:02,864
Um, I think I had some
constipation and sleep issues.

454
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:04,197
When? How long?

455
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:05,567
I... I don't know.

456
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:08,300
I don't remember.
I... I told my doctor

457
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:10,308
and he told me
not to worry about it.

458
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:13,675
He told me to forget
about it, so... I did.

459
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:33,121
Mrs. Williams.

460
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:36,758
I have an urgent problem
I have to talk to you about.

461
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:40,738
- You'll need to wait your turn, Mr...
- I am Dr. Shaun Murphy.

462
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:42,468
I need answers
about Jean Starzak.

463
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:44,601
She was your patient,
now she is my patient.

464
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,612
Dr. Murphy, if you can
wait, we can talk in private.

465
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,341
Okay, yes.

466
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:51,349
You failed to chart many
of Jean's symptoms.

467
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:54,181
Constipation, sleep disturbances,
hot flashes, reduced libido.

468
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:57,086
She's not sure she remembers all
of her symptoms or when they began,

469
00:30:57,155 --> 00:31:00,614
- so we cannot figure out what is wrong.
- Sounds to me like she's in menopause.

470
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,291
You're a talented
diagnostician, Mrs. Williams.

471
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:06,355
No, she's not.

472
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:09,060
Menopause doesn't explain
her recent blood pressure issues.

473
00:31:09,134 --> 00:31:11,330
- Mrs. Starzak's chart, please?
- It's not in there.

474
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,562
And she mentioned several
episodes of nighttime dizziness,

475
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:16,437
which I believe were seizures.

476
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:20,878
What is in here is enough to remind
me that the dizziness was menopause.

477
00:31:20,946 --> 00:31:23,711
Micturition syncope,
not seizures.

478
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:27,214
And the blood pressure
issue isn't new...

479
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:30,317
but also isn't a symptom

480
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:33,188
of anything besides her
anxiety about forced retirement.

481
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,190
It wasn't.

482
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:39,359
I know it happened
during surgery.

483
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:42,060
She wasn't anxious,
she was unconscious.

484
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:47,798
My daughter is never
coming to see you.

485
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:08,156
According to this piece
in Clinical Endocrinology,

486
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:11,321
Jean's symptoms match pretty
well with Addison's disease.

487
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:15,163
She doesn't have hyper
pigmentation or weight loss.

488
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:17,793
- Not all cases presented with...
- Cortisol levels are normal.

489
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:22,908
There have been several recent
case studies collating hypothyroidism

490
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:27,309
with low post-op EP.
Jean's TSH is borderline high.

491
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:31,009
But her thyroid hormone
is in the normal range.

492
00:32:34,853 --> 00:32:36,446
What about sleep apnea?

493
00:32:37,222 --> 00:32:39,384
I read about a case
involving BP crashes.

494
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:40,458
That's interesting.

495
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:44,687
Jean's body type isn't typical of
that, but we could ask about snoring.

496
00:32:44,763 --> 00:32:47,130
I would like to see
that case literature.

497
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:52,270
It's not a conventional
case writeup.

498
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:55,873
I saw a post on Reddit.

499
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,182
What subgroup?

500
00:33:07,052 --> 00:33:08,816
The Women's Health Community.

501
00:33:08,887 --> 00:33:11,755
It's not scientific at all.

502
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:13,982
It's not helpful.

503
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:16,824
But neither is this.
There is nothing here.

504
00:33:17,796 --> 00:33:20,197
The medical establishment
isn't looking into this stuff.

505
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:21,494
It's ignored women like Jean.

506
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:25,333
As demonstrated by her own
doctor not charting her symptoms.

507
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:30,341
That is true. But it is still a bad
idea to rely on anecdotal evidence.

508
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:31,569
Yeah, and I agree with you.

509
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:33,805
If you have a better idea,
I am happy to go with it.

510
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,046
Keep checking Reddit.

511
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:46,314
Claire, can you look at
social media postings?

512
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:49,584
I'll check out the blogs.

513
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:57,326
You changed your
profile picture. It sucks.

514
00:33:57,402 --> 00:33:58,335
It looks like me.

515
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:01,305
It's not like I photoshopped your
head on someone else's body.

516
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:04,537
If I'm going to sell myself, I at
least want to sell who I actually am.

517
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:07,841
The women who answer your
post don't care who you actually are.

518
00:34:07,913 --> 00:34:10,678
And based on this photo, I
don't think you know who you are.

519
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:13,182
You're reading Proust?

520
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,882
Once the Ondansetron sets in,
you should start feeling better.

521
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:23,562
Just in time for your
next chemo session.

522
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:30,630
I'll get through it.

523
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:32,966
I know you will.

524
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:37,334
Doesn't mean you should.

525
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:41,545
It's dumb.

526
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,817
You're acting like an idiot
because you're less afraid of months

527
00:34:46,885 --> 00:34:50,049
of pain and nausea
than being exposed.

528
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:55,291
You've constructed
a perfect facade,

529
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:58,460
and you're going to kill
yourself trying to preserve it.

530
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:03,094
But being strong has nothing
to do with being The Body.

531
00:35:03,168 --> 00:35:06,627
Tell that to my
fans, my sponsors.

532
00:35:09,374 --> 00:35:11,104
I think you should.

533
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:16,144
Tell them none of
this makes you a man.

534
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:21,683
You were just as brave and strong
back when you were a fat, bullied,

535
00:35:21,753 --> 00:35:24,484
little kid that decided
to make a change.

536
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:28,351
That kid didn't let other
people tell him who he could be

537
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:30,122
or what he was capable of.

538
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:35,530
Don't let him down now.

539
00:35:50,415 --> 00:35:51,542
Schedule the surgery.

540
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:17,806
This woman says she had
chronic low blood pressure.

541
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:20,845
And her doctors blamed it
on her weight-loss obsession.

542
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,746
Turned out she had
congestive heart failure.

543
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:29,946
This woman's seizures were
attributed to her pregnancy.

544
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:32,184
She was on her fourth doctor

545
00:36:32,257 --> 00:36:34,453
before they correctly
diagnosed her epilepsy.

546
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:36,327
I've got something.

547
00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:40,898
This woman spent years with
the same symptoms as Jean

548
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:42,365
before she was diagnosed.

549
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,763
Parkinson's disease.

550
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:01,477
You're healing well. The pathology
results show clean margins.

551
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:02,919
You should regain full strength

552
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:04,751
and be back in the
octagon in a few months.

553
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,224
Thank you.

554
00:37:09,194 --> 00:37:10,753
There's something
I want to show you.

555
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:18,529
"My next fight is
Breast Cancer."

556
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:23,940
Over a million views, with some
very encouraging comments.

557
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:26,510
A few you will want to mute.

558
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:32,008
And a bunch of women
who are really into scars.

559
00:37:44,162 --> 00:37:47,826
The test confirms you
have Parkinson's disease.

560
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,826
We believe it has been
progressing for a few years.

561
00:37:52,537 --> 00:37:55,564
Your hip pain may well
have been the first indicator.

562
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:01,504
Can I still fly?

563
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:02,774
I'm afraid not.

564
00:38:13,558 --> 00:38:15,026
How do we treat it?

565
00:38:15,093 --> 00:38:18,188
Unfortunately, the
delay in diagnosis

566
00:38:18,263 --> 00:38:20,391
has allowed the
symptoms to intensify,

567
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:23,060
and there is nothing we
can do to reverse that.

568
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:27,762
You should still have several
more years of decent mobility.

569
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:31,469
And we can help manage
the symptoms with medication.

570
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:36,677
We'll let you two
have some time alone.

571
00:38:49,394 --> 00:38:50,828
I'd like to go home.

572
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:53,697
Can you, uh...?

573
00:38:56,201 --> 00:38:58,363
Can you see about
getting me discharged?

574
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:05,235
Tori, please go.

575
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:10,345
No, Mom.

576
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:19,690
It's okay.

577
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:59,395
How's your phone battery?
'Cause there's a charger at my place.

578
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,090
It's time to retire
that metaphor.

579
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,401
I'm busy.

580
00:40:06,104 --> 00:40:09,268
You were right. I'm attachment prone
and there's nothing wrong with that.

581
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,969
As long as I'm with someone
who feels the same way.

582
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:13,477
I found the place.

583
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:18,745
Flanagan's. Oysters, overpriced
IPAs, the game on three big screens.

584
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:20,817
Perfect.

585
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:27,457
See you tomorrow.

586
00:40:40,138 --> 00:40:44,473
I'd want our daughter to have the
chance to have everything she wants.

587
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:48,910
And I want you to have the
chance to have everything you want.

588
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:51,014
And I can't.

589
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:55,242
Not by myself.

590
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:09,733
It's okay that I am bad at
massages. She will handle them.

591
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:12,334
Thank you.

592
00:41:15,907 --> 00:41:18,376
How do you two feel
about frankincense oil?

593
00:41:18,443 --> 00:41:19,968
Um...

594
00:41:23,014 --> 00:41:24,014
No, thanks.

595
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,345
Lea?

596
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:38,361
The world is harder for women.

597
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:42,631
I want to change that,
but I don't know how.

598
00:41:46,371 --> 00:41:49,671
By being an amazing
dad to our daughter.

599
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:54,367
By letting her know that
she's loved and supported.

600
00:41:55,213 --> 00:41:56,841
We'll raise her to be strong.

601
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:01,709
Like you.
