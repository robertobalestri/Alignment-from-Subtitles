1
00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:06,204
We are having a baby.

2
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,203
Morning, Shaun.

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,837
- Were you watching me sleep?
- Yes.

4
00:00:13,914 --> 00:00:15,542
We are having a baby.

5
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:24,420
That baby is making me feel
like I ate three-month-old sushi.

6
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:29,296
Good morning, berry.

7
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,992
Why are you making
Mommy feel this way?

8
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:34,728
Are we naming it Berry?

9
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:38,167
For now, because he's
the size of a blueberry.

10
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:44,373
I can just picture your face on
a little blueberry-sized baby...

11
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,174
At week seven,

12
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:49,773
the fetus has developed
webbed hands and feet.

13
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,217
And you have started
to form a mucus plug...

14
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:54,677
Your breath is
killing me, Shaun.

15
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:59,292
I brushed my teeth. Twice.

16
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,692
Because I thought
we might have sex.

17
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:04,823
The mint from the...
The toothpaste is... It's...

18
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:07,696
Mm-mm.

19
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:15,905
Stop smirking like
you're picturing me naked.

20
00:01:15,976 --> 00:01:18,036
Don't have to picture
it. Saw it already.

21
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:20,808
You're running a little late. Did I
keep you up too long last night?

22
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:23,851
Don't flatter yourself. I'm
not late and it wasn't that long.

23
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:26,747
What are you doing?

24
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:29,549
Shielding us from the rain?

25
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:31,319
What do you think
this is, <i>The Notebook?</i>

26
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:34,361
It's raining and I
shared my umbrella.

27
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:38,558
Having sex doesn't
make us a thing.

28
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:40,757
We need to make
clear boundaries.

29
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:42,928
I don't need romantic
gestures from you.

30
00:01:43,003 --> 00:01:46,804
I shared my umbrella, I didn't propose.
But I hear your message, loud and clear.

31
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:48,171
You hate me. I hate you.

32
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:49,976
See you tonight?

33
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:57,410
Can I help you?

34
00:01:58,652 --> 00:01:59,711
Hello, Claire.

35
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,448
My name is Miles Browne. I'm...

36
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,190
your father.

37
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:11,529
- What are you doing here?
- I've owed you a lot of answers

38
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,033
- for a long time, and...
- Go home.

39
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:15,262
Um... Oh.

40
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:16,335
I just, uh...

41
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:21,807
What I... Well, I
wish I was a better...

42
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,210
Um...

43
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:29,743
I don't want you to... hate...

44
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:30,816
Can you lift your arms?

45
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:33,448
Keep them up.

46
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:36,781
Okay. Repeat after me,
"Don't cry over spilled milk."

47
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:39,652
Don't... F... Fry...

48
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:43,567
We need to get you to the hospital.
I think you're having a stroke.

49
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:57,034
The quickstep is my nemesis.

50
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,477
I lost my footing and
landed on a 90-year-old judge

51
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,572
with very sharp elbows.

52
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:05,278
And he insisted I come
in even though I'm fine.

53
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:06,786
Just a little sore.

54
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,687
Yeah, but Maya's "a little sore"
is a normal person's excruciating.

55
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:12,419
Take the compliment, babe.

56
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:15,427
You're shivering.

57
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:19,227
The abdomen is tense and
distended. She's hypotensive.

58
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:22,565
We need to do an ultrasound to
check for acute abdominal injury.

59
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:24,127
I'm fine.

60
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:26,902
When did you start
feeling lightheaded?

61
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:29,032
About an hour ago.

62
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:32,244
There is significant pressure
on the abdominal contents.

63
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:37,078
- What does that mean?
- She has a retroperitoneal bleed.

64
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,483
We need to get you
into surgery right away.

65
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,628
Hi, Mr. Browne. I'm
Dr. Allen, this is Dr. Park.

66
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,688
- How are you feeling?
- Much better.

67
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:53,393
I see where Claire
gets her good looks.

68
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:59,964
BP looks good. 124 over 83. Have
you had these symptoms before?

69
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,532
Happens sometimes
when I get migraines.

70
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,976
Yeah. Migraines come
when I'm stressed.

71
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,404
Don't cry over spilled milk.

72
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:14,146
Look. I don't want to take
up too much of your time,

73
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:17,316
but is it possible we can go
somewhere quiet and talk?

74
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,689
Maybe we could grab
a coffee or dessert.

75
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,662
You know, you used to
love Rocky Road ice cream.

76
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,095
Is that still your favorite?

77
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:26,429
You just had a major
neurological event.

78
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,265
We need to run some CT
scans to identify the cause.

79
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:33,673
Found the bleeder. Clamp.

80
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,801
We need to open up the
retroperitoneal space and pack.

81
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:37,970
BP's still dropping.

82
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:41,105
It's not clotting. She have any history
of hemophilia or bleeding disorder?

83
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:43,980
- No.
- Push FFP, TXA, and fibrinogen.

84
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,281
Pack more lap pads and
evacuate the hematoma.

85
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:55,619
Pressure's rising.

86
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:05,871
This young lady almost died
from a collision with an elbow.

87
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:07,874
There must be something
else going on here.

88
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:09,341
Find out what it is.

89
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:26,825
We'll start by scanning your
abdomen. I'll help you up on the bed.

90
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:30,196
You were right.

91
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:32,830
<i>It wasn't a migraine.</i>

92
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:38,071
I have terminal cancer.

93
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,211
His oncologist started him
on chemo, it shrunk the tumor,

94
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:51,911
but Miles didn't finish it.

95
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:54,887
The location of the metastases
still likely leaves it inoperable.

96
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:58,653
I don't know. If we use transcatheter
hepatic artery chemoembolization,

97
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,320
we might be able to attack
the tumor and spare his liver.

98
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,390
Claire, what do you think?

99
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,337
It's the patient's decision.

100
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:12,372
You should take it to him.

101
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,463
Let him decide.

102
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:21,642
You have abnormally
large platelets.

103
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,941
It's a rare condition called
Bernard-Soulier syndrome,

104
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:27,180
which makes it difficult
for your blood to clot.

105
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:29,018
It's why you almost
bled out during surgery.

106
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:31,115
Is it treatable?
Will she be okay?

107
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:33,183
There's no cure,
but it is manageable.

108
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:37,698
Keep an eye out for pain or bruising or
any other symptoms that don't go away.

109
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,858
That could be a sign
of a larger problem.

110
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:42,767
- It's just a pulled muscle.
- You don't know that.

111
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:47,274
My left leg has been
bothering me for a few weeks.

112
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,340
Months.

113
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:53,072
I'm not overreacting.

114
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,817
We'll need to run CTs
of your hip and femur

115
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:02,355
to rule out osteoarthritis
or an occult fracture.

116
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:10,394
- How does that feel?
- Weird.

117
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:17,962
- Better?
- Sure.

118
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:19,370
Why do I need this?

119
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,069
Back pain is a common symptom
of pregnancy. It's preventative.

120
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:27,744
You should take these twice a day,
with food or milk. Preferably food.

121
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,407
I already have
prenatal vitamins.

122
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:33,249
You have the chewable gummy
kind. Tablets are better for the fetus.

123
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,948
Okay, please stop
calling it a fetus.

124
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:38,287
- It is a fetus.
- It's our baby.

125
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:42,322
Okay, I don't need you
to do any of this, Shaun.

126
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,997
What do you need me to do?

127
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:50,936
Just... be the
dad, not the doctor.

128
00:07:57,444 --> 00:07:59,970
Do you think I'm going
to drink this? What's in it?

129
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:02,481
Urine? Saliva? A tropical fish?

130
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:03,847
Coffee.

131
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:07,150
Dr. Park, I need to talk
to you about our patient.

132
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,712
Let's do an additional
split-thickness skin graft.

133
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,917
That's a long,
complicated procedure.

134
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,518
If you're going to scrub
in, you'll need the caffeine.

135
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,756
I hear you've been keeping
some pretty late nights.

136
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:22,402
Too much caffeine before
surgery leads to unsteady hands.

137
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:25,303
I can assure you I am well
rested. I don't need the coffee.

138
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,783
Your father refused surgery.

139
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:46,754
His slurred speech was
a side effect of chemo.

140
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:50,160
Treatment almost took him
out. He doesn't want to try again.

141
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:53,127
Thanks for letting me know.

142
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,906
I know a lot of girls who
didn't have their fathers.

143
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:07,010
But yours did
something theirs didn't...

144
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,409
he came back.

145
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,915
He came back to
absolve himself of guilt.

146
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:15,915
That's a gift I'm not giving
him. That's his burden to carry.

147
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:18,390
Forgiveness isn't for
the one you're forgiving.

148
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:21,024
It's for you.

149
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:28,096
It's Miles. His
liver's bleeding.

150
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:32,367
Go.

151
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,447
They seem like a
very nice couple.

152
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:49,088
Very... connected.

153
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:53,388
I wish I knew
how to be like that.

154
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,919
They're not a couple.

155
00:09:58,298 --> 00:09:59,766
Leo's gay.

156
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:03,564
Can gay people really
detect other gay people?

157
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,637
You can if you check
out their Instagram.

158
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:09,637
Dr. Murphy...

159
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:14,070
I don't think she has arthritis,
but I don't know what this is.

160
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:20,987
Her disorder caused blood-filled
pseudotumors in her leg.

161
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,448
The blood ate away her bone.

162
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:33,393
Your liver was bleeding because
your tumor exceeded its blood supply.

163
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:36,869
It puts you at risk for
serious complications...

164
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,129
even a fatal one.

165
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:42,508
Please reconsider the surgery.

166
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:44,407
Yeah, I'm not afraid of dying.

167
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:48,675
Where's my daughter? Why isn't
she here telling me any of this?

168
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,257
I think it's time
for me to go home.

169
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:05,397
What about 3D
printed scaffolding?

170
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:08,060
We could recreate the shape
of the bone, graft new stem cells,

171
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,899
and allograft onto it to
generate new growth.

172
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,031
Her underlying disorder
would eat away the new bone.

173
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:17,202
Everything I do upsets Lea
and makes her mad at me.

174
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:21,744
Oh, that's what I'm
doing here, I'm guessing?

175
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:26,013
Mm-hm. Yes. You're both here
because I have two questions.

176
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:28,781
When I tell my patient her
femur bone is destroyed,

177
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:32,417
she is going to ask if I can save her
leg and I don't have an answer to that.

178
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:34,961
Lea and I are in love.
We're going to have a baby.

179
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,088
We should feel
very happy right now,

180
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:41,225
but I feel like I'm living with a stranger
who doesn't want me to breathe on them.

181
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:45,066
We could do an expandable
Osseo integrated limb replacement.

182
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:46,698
- Too risky.
- Too many surgeries, yeah.

183
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:51,741
Well, you're going to have
a kid, Shaun, and you...

184
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:53,973
You can't expect
everything to be the same.

185
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,879
Lea's going through
a whole lot of changes.

186
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:56,949
You both are.

187
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,987
- No. I'm the same.
- Well, maybe that's the problem, Shaun.

188
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:04,149
You're in a relationship
with three people now.

189
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,522
You're going to have
to make adjustments.

190
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:07,593
Both of you.

191
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,565
Okay.

192
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,760
We could use
high-density polyethylene

193
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:19,237
on the distal femoral segment
to anchor it to the tendons.

194
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:21,472
I don't like adjusting.

195
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:31,575
You wanted to see me.

196
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:38,049
If we discharge
him, he's going to die.

197
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:46,059
I don't expect you would feel
anything but contempt for Miles.

198
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:49,034
He was supposed to take
care of you and he didn't.

199
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:54,102
And now I'm asking you to do
for him what he never did for you.

200
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:56,699
Oh, he did take care
of me. He just quit.

201
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:00,812
He used to pick me up
every day after school.

202
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,408
And then one day he just...

203
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,579
stopped showing up.

204
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:13,224
And for years after,
I would come home,

205
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,588
I'd make sure the
curtains were open...

206
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:17,757
and I'd wait.

207
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,696
If a car slowed down
in front of the house,

208
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,760
I'd imagine it was him coming
to grab me up and rescue me.

209
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:26,499
And I thought if I wanted
it enough, he'd come back.

210
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:29,667
So I just had to want
it more, you know?

211
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,680
And finally, I gave up. I
stopped looking out the window.

212
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:43,551
I grieved and buried my father
a long time ago, and I'm just...

213
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:49,187
I'm not interested in getting to know
him just to grieve him all over again.

214
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,932
But he's still your father.
And you're still you.

215
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,075
Someday you'll hate yourself
if you turn your back on him.

216
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:12,617
We would secure the titanium
prosthetic to the hip socket and tibia

217
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,484
using cement augmentation
for stability and support.

218
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:18,457
You would have full
flexibility and range of motion.

219
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,892
And with physical therapy, you
should be able to dance again.

220
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:23,823
If you survive the surgery.

221
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,667
- I could die?
- Yes.

222
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:30,829
There is a 10 to 15 percent
chance. Approximately.

223
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:33,600
Femur replacement is a
very complicated procedure

224
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:36,541
made even riskier by
your underlying condition.

225
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,942
The safest route is to amputate.

226
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:42,709
Very little chance of major
complication during surgery.

227
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:45,513
And there have been great
advancements in prosthetics.

228
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:47,680
My dance career would be over.

229
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,681
Most likely. But you
would still have your life.

230
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:54,550
My life is dance.

231
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,392
Do whatever it
takes to save the leg.

232
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:03,129
Oh, Maya. It's too big a risk.

233
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,329
But you know what
this means to me.

234
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:11,668
But if there's a chance
I could die tomorrow,

235
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:15,377
there's something
I have to do first.

236
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:17,576
<i>♪ I played my cards wrong ♪</i>

237
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,620

250

You should come over tonight...

251
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:46,799
unless you need to rest up
for your franken-penis surgery.

252
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,274
You embarrassed me
in front of a superior.

253
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:56,539
Did you get fired? Did you
get pulled off the surgery?

254
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,213
I was just getting you back
for giving me that rancid coffee.

255
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:01,914
It was coffee.

256
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:04,753
Plain coffee with one
cream and one sugar.

257
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:08,090
The exact coffee I've seen you
have every day for the last three years.

258
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,992
I was being nice.

259
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:12,998
The same reason I put an
umbrella over your gigantic head.

260
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:14,624
I was being a
decent human being.

261
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:17,368
When did we start doing that?

262
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:20,838
How was I supposed to know
that you didn't dose my coffee?

263
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:24,203
Because I'm not an emotionally
stunted person. You are.

264
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:26,769
Anything that resembles
intimacy freaks you out

265
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:29,509
and you start throwing
blows. Low ones.

266
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:35,449
And if hooking up causes you
to cross boundaries like that,

267
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:37,786
it's better to go back
to the way things were.

268
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:40,326
Barely friends. No benefits.

269
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:55,534
You're in love with him...

270
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:58,109
aren't you?

271
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:01,745
Is that why you're
having the surgery?

272
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:07,016
You're afraid that if you
lose dance, you lose him?

273
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:13,348
You're risking your life
to save something that...

274
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,094
isn't real.

275
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:19,058
Leo and I share a life together.

276
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,098
We're partners in every
sense of the word...

277
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,532
except one.

278
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:31,836
My best friend growing up was...

279
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:34,579
a girl named Rachel.

280
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,850
She and I lived in a
very religious community

281
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:40,716
so it was kind of
assumed we'd get married.

282
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,752
Which was fine with me
because Rachel was...

283
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:50,719
beautiful and smart and funny...

284
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:53,932
and I loved her.

285
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,566
But then I fell in love with
the boy down the street.

286
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:01,271
He never knew, nothing
ever happened between us...

287
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:04,776
but it's like all of a sudden...

288
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:07,379
the world...

289
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:10,615
lit up.

290
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:12,378
And I realized...

291
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:14,911
Rachel and I wasn't enough.

292
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:18,948
I had been lying
to myself, and...

293
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:21,192
to her.

294
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,789
She deserved to be loved...

295
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,958
and wanted in a way that...

296
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:31,437
lit up someone's world.

297
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:38,301
And she spent years loving
someone who could never give her that.

298
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:43,810
You need to tell
Leo how you feel.

299
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:53,683
We share our
secrets... our pain.

300
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,859
He listens to me when
I've had a bad day.

301
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,926
He holds me when I'm scared.

302
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:08,337
I don't want anything
to change between us.

303
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,581
<i>♪ I swear to God,

00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,391
Okay. Yeah.

308
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:38,536
Okay.

309
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:44,909
Ow.

310
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:54,311
Okay, the swaying is making
me feel really pukey right now.

311
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,048
Could we try this
at another time?

<i>♪ We're fallin' like the

313
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:19,905
I feel...

314
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:25,208
disconnected from you.

315
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:28,920
And... the baby, which...

316
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:34,660
yes, you are very connected to
already. But I don't feel anything.

317
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:37,854
Because it is not a baby yet.

318
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,592
It is a fetus, and...

319
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:44,232
it is making my girlfriend sick

320
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,569
and mad at me.
And I feel very...

321
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:52,076
alone.

322
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,791
You are being so...

323
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:08,192
selfish.

324
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:12,060
I'm growing your baby, Shaun.

325
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:14,430
And reading books and
making appointments

326
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,368
and taking vitamins the size of
my face and working a full-time job.

327
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:20,133
And on top of that,
you just dropped on me

328
00:22:20,206 --> 00:22:22,675
that you don't feel
anything for our baby?

329
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:27,202
And expect me to make you
feel love and connected and...

330
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,016
No. You know...

331
00:22:56,175 --> 00:22:58,041
Dr. Lim suggested
I come talk to you.

332
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:05,416
I know you deserve
better than me.

333
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:09,421
You deserved a father, and I failed
you. And I can't make up for that.

334
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:12,757
Breeze and I were
high school sweethearts.

335
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:16,323
We thought we were going
to take over the world together.

336
00:23:17,363 --> 00:23:21,698
We were young
and naive and stupid.

337
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:24,628
And we got pregnant
before graduation.

338
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:28,704
I had a scholarship to Howard,
but it didn't cover family housing.

339
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:31,903
So I gave it up because
I wanted to be there...

340
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:33,655
Yet you left the family
you gave it up for.

341
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,080
- You should've taken the scholarship.
- And we got married

342
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:37,776
and we gave it a go for a while.

343
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:42,282
But I could not handle
Breeze's mental illness.

344
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:44,653
When we broke up, she
made it hard to see you...

345
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:47,215
Don't blame her for
what you didn't do.

346
00:23:47,293 --> 00:23:48,454
I am not blaming her.

347
00:23:49,395 --> 00:23:51,261
- I was immature...
- At least she was there.

348
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:53,932
At least she stuck around,

349
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:56,432
drunk and sick and
out of her mind...

350
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:59,832
I... I waited for you

351
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:02,898
and I loved you and you left.

352
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:04,841
Claire, I've always loved you.

353
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:07,209
Nothing could change that.

354
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,679
- I thought about you every single day.
- You know, I don't care.

355
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:17,586
Thinking about me wasn't enough.
It didn't do anything for me at all.

356
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:20,091
You...

357
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,989
You could have fought for me.

358
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,592
You could have
come back before now.

359
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:32,431
I ran away. I was a coward.

360
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:34,766
And I stayed away

361
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,071
because I was running
from my own guilt.

362
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:46,007
Whether I'm in your life or
not, you should get the surgery.

363
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:48,845
Because if you don't...

364
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:51,922
then you're still a coward.

365
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:11,501
I feel scared too.

366
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,814
What are you scared of?

367
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:19,743
Everything.

368
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:22,878
And I don't want to
go through this alone.

369
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:26,724
I don't want to go
through nine months

370
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:30,388
knowing you view this
baby as a medical condition

371
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:31,862
you don't feel anything for.

372
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:34,758
I'll resent you.

373
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,261
And that scares me
more than anything.

374
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,799
And I want to help
you feel connected.

375
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:53,050
Oh, no, sorry. We're
not having sex right now.

376
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:56,145
I realize that was
misleading. I...

377
00:25:56,221 --> 00:26:00,682
I want you to put your head
on my belly and talk to Berry.

378
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:05,554
- About what?
- Anything.

379
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,780
Hello...

380
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,750
Berry.

381
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:33,014
My patient is a
26-year-old ballroom dancer

382
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:35,254
with Bernard-Soulier syndrome.

383
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:40,562
She presented with
a retroperitoneal bleed

384
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:44,262
but now needs a total
femur replacement.

385
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:46,100
It is a very risky surgery.

386
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:55,246
I am your father,
and I am a surgeon.

387
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:03,049
Did that make you feel
better, to talk to him?

388
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:07,525
No.

389
00:27:07,593 --> 00:27:10,927
The fetus can't hear any
sounds until 18 weeks.

390
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:12,931
And we don't
know if it's a him yet

391
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:15,160
because it doesn't have
fully formed genitals.

392
00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:16,964
I will see you at your
appointment later.

393
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:21,066
I don't think you should come.

394
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,107
There is a chance it's too
early to hear a heartbeat,

395
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,479
which will make me
feel sad and scared.

396
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:34,785
And if I can hear
it, I will feel happy.

397
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:39,151
And either way, you
will probably feel...

398
00:27:40,192 --> 00:27:41,192
nothing.

399
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:45,230
And that'll make me feel
more alone than I already do.

400
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:48,927
So you should just not come.

401
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:54,505
Okay.

402
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:57,061
Isn't it possible Leo loves
Maya as much as she loves him?

403
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,501
Does it matter that he doesn't
want to have sex with her?

404
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:02,505
Sex isn't just about sex.

405
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:06,939
It's about intimacy, and desire,

406
00:29:07,012 --> 00:29:09,413
and a deep, mutual,
physical connection.

407
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:12,076
And she thinks she has that.

408
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:16,749
That's the last of
the proximal femur.

409
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,914
Let's get the distal end out.

410
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:24,429
Maybe Maya and Leo have
such a strong relationship

411
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:27,125
because it's based entirely
on an emotional connection.

412
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:32,502
She's hypotensive.

413
00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:34,938
There are secretions
around her breathing tube

414
00:29:35,007 --> 00:29:37,567
and oxygen levels are dropping.
She's rejecting the platelets.

415
00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:39,202
Stop the transfusion.

416
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:41,304
Increase her oxygen
and respiratory support.

417
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,212
Start dopamine and epinephrine.

418
00:29:46,051 --> 00:29:49,579
BP is 87 over 52.
She's stabilizing.

419
00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:53,786
But without the transfusions, her
risk of bleeding out goes way up.

420
00:29:55,027 --> 00:29:57,929
Are we going to move
forward or amputate?

421
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:01,830
Her partner's her proxy, right?

422
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:05,837
He's got a decision to make.

423
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:13,544
Oh, my God.

424
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:24,550
She trusts me to protect her
wishes, and she wants to dance.

425
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:28,093
You should try to save her leg.

426
00:30:35,434 --> 00:30:36,993
Maya's in love with you.

427
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,095
That's why she's
having the surgery.

428
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:43,665
She thinks if she loses dance,
your relationship will end.

429
00:30:44,743 --> 00:30:47,178
And only you
know if she's right.

430
00:30:49,081 --> 00:30:53,314
If she is, if losing her leg means
losing the two things she loves most,

431
00:30:53,385 --> 00:30:55,286
then maybe you
should honor her wishes.

432
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:57,847
But if she's wrong,

433
00:30:58,824 --> 00:31:02,158
if you do love her and will
stay with her no matter what,

434
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:05,523
then you should do whatever
it takes to save her life.

435
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:06,997
Of course I love her.

436
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:10,397
There's no question
that I love her.

437
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:13,330
So the only question is...

438
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,140
how much?

439
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:22,312
Miles is stable.

440
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:28,009
But we found a
significant polyp burden

441
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:30,214
not detected on his CT

442
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:31,517
and we sent to biopsies.

443
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:37,193
His cancer was caused by
familial adenomatous polyposis.

444
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:39,330
That's genetic.

445
00:31:40,499 --> 00:31:43,765
Fifty percent chance of carrying the
gene if you have an affected parent.

446
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:46,129
You need to get a genetic test.

447
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:50,666
Even if you have the gene,
with regular colonoscopies

448
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,438
- we'll be able catch it as...
- Thank you.

449
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,814
- What's this?
- Male, late 20s,

450
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,825
needs bilateral carpal
tunnel release surgery

451
00:32:06,892 --> 00:32:10,886
that he got playing in the
United States Chess Federation.

452
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:15,129
You like to play chess with
Kellan. Your game sucks.

453
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,862
Figured you might
learn something.

454
00:32:22,474 --> 00:32:25,569
This is you being
a decent human?

455
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,979
Maybe sometimes
it's not terrible.

456
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:34,718
This is... delightful.

457
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,390
- I can give it to someone else.
- Thanks.

458
00:32:47,499 --> 00:32:50,264
Are you glad you went to
see your father before he died?

459
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:53,128
No. My father hurt me.

460
00:32:53,205 --> 00:32:57,108
He was a bad man who did
bad things. I already knew that.

461
00:32:57,909 --> 00:32:59,400
My father hurt me too...

462
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:01,438
by leaving me.

463
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:04,976
He didn't even try
to be a good dad.

464
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:10,652
How can you be sure he didn't?

465
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:14,521
Maybe he did try
and he couldn't.

466
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:20,896
Well, if something is important
to you, you make it happen.

467
00:33:20,966 --> 00:33:22,161
But what if you can't?

468
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:27,335
What if you are trying to
connect with your child and it...

469
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:30,169
just doesn't work?

470
00:33:35,447 --> 00:33:40,476
It is difficult to feel something
for someone you don't know yet.

471
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:48,286
Do you want to know what
kind of man your father is?

472
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,199
Why would you do this to me?

473
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:07,842
I told you I was
willing to take the risk.

474
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:10,812
I wasn't.

475
00:34:14,586 --> 00:34:18,455
I love you. I couldn't
risk your life. I'm so sorry.

476
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:19,889
But I'm here.

477
00:34:20,592 --> 00:34:23,858
I'm not going anywhere.
You're not going to lose me.

478
00:34:27,866 --> 00:34:29,391
We're going to get
through this, My.

479
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:32,803
We'll be okay.

480
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,536
I sleep all the time,
and I'm still tired.

481
00:34:40,612 --> 00:34:43,673
- When was your last bowel movement?
- I don't know, a couple days.

482
00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:47,412
Shaun, what are you doing here?

483
00:34:49,621 --> 00:34:51,590
- Smile.
- Uh, what?

484
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:53,557
- There's something in your teeth.
- Shaun.

485
00:34:55,694 --> 00:34:57,595
Do you eat a lot
of black licorice?

486
00:34:57,662 --> 00:34:59,654
- Uh, yes.
- You should stop.

487
00:34:59,731 --> 00:35:01,859
Eating too much black
licorice can lower potassium

488
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,164
which causes fatigue
and constipation.

489
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:05,235
Stop eating it.

490
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:07,730
- That's it?
- Yes.

491
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:16,808
Lea doesn't want me at
her OB-GYN appointment.

492
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:19,578
There's a woman in the waiting
room with a very interesting mole.

493
00:35:24,723 --> 00:35:28,956
The year Maddie was born, I
took on twice as many surgeries.

494
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,790
I... I hid at the hospital.

495
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:34,594
I was afraid that I was
going to piss off my wife.

496
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:36,931
Sound familiar?
Upset my daughter.

497
00:35:37,669 --> 00:35:40,434
- I thought you liked being a dad.
- I did. I...

498
00:35:41,406 --> 00:35:44,137
I just didn't think I
was very good at it. I...

499
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:46,904
It didn't come naturally to me.

500
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,277
Not like... Not
like brain surgery.

501
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:52,076
I missed a lot.

502
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:57,748
Sometimes I think if I had
been there for the swaddling

503
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:00,018
and for the changing
of the diapers and...

504
00:36:03,128 --> 00:36:04,528
see her first steps, you know...

505
00:36:09,968 --> 00:36:11,960
Shaun, do yourself a favor,

506
00:36:12,037 --> 00:36:15,906
and be there for as many
moments as you can.

507
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,154
Taking the scenic route?

508
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:36,723
Car needs brakes and
Uber was taking forever.

509
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,928
Chess guy is super cool.

510
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:43,298
He's going to teach me
Petrov's Defense while he heals.

511
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,900
I didn't mean to take things
so far in front of Andrews.

512
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:53,069
I guess I had a
tiny overreaction.

513
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:57,476
It's okay for us to be nice
to each other... sometimes.

514
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:02,519
Headed home?

515
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:06,820
I wouldn't mind some
company if you're up for it.

516
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,759
See? Nice is good.

517
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:15,199
Sometimes.

518
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:17,197
I'll see you at your place.

519
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,220
Where's Leo?

520
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:39,285
I don't know.

521
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:42,994
I asked him if this
could be enough.

522
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:45,556
If I could be...

523
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,898
He loves me, I knew that,

524
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:54,101
but not enough.

525
00:37:57,542 --> 00:37:59,204
I suppose I knew that too.

526
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,578
As long as he was here,

527
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,581
I would never make
room for anyone else...

528
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,054
so I asked him to go.

529
00:38:19,931 --> 00:38:21,092
I'm sorry.

530
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:22,833
It's okay.

531
00:38:23,935 --> 00:38:26,097
I'm sure there are
a ton of great guys

532
00:38:26,171 --> 00:38:29,039
who'd want to be with a one-legged,
unemployed former dancer

533
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:30,234
with chronic nosebleeds.

534
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,567
I've been mad at
you for so long...

535
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:12,181
that I couldn't feel any
other emotion, just anger.

536
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:14,979
Angry at you...

537
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:19,951
angry at myself for secretly wishing
you would turn up on my doorstep

538
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,287
my entire life.

539
00:39:23,595 --> 00:39:24,824
I thought I'd outgrown it.

540
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:34,002
But when you went
into surgery today...

541
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,609
I didn't feel anger, I felt...

542
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:43,747
fear.

543
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:12,636
You get some rest.

544
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:19,840
When you feel better, you...

545
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:23,220
You can take me for Rocky Road.

546
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:27,149
It is still my favorite.

547
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:46,036
I love you.

548
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:13,203
- Are you ready?
- Mm-hm.

549
00:41:16,741 --> 00:41:18,266
You came.

550
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:22,770
Hello. I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

551
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:24,648
I'm the dad.

552
00:41:25,717 --> 00:41:28,050
Nice to meet you, Dad.

553
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:29,587
We just got started.

554
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:33,050
- Where did you go to medical school?
- Shaun.

555
00:41:33,124 --> 00:41:35,889
Her diploma is not on the
wall. I would like to know.

556
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,727
Just be the dad. Sit
there. Be quiet. Do nothing.

557
00:41:48,106 --> 00:41:50,132
Is that the...?

558
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:52,939
That's the heartbeat.
Right there.

559
00:41:57,115 --> 00:41:58,481
We're having a baby.

560
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:08,851
We're having a baby.
