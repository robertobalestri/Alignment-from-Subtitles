<i>Previously on</i> The Good Doctor:

2
00:00:03,704 --> 00:00:05,263
The aneurysm
caused his back pain.

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:07,501
- Dr. Wolke missed it.
- I screwed up.

4
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:09,866
Compressions?

5
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:13,641
Dr. Wolke...

6
00:00:14,915 --> 00:00:16,144
He's dead.

7
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:18,042
Take as much time as you need.

8
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:21,918
The virus has damaged
your mother's lungs.

9
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:24,083
We're doing everything
we can to help her.

10
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:27,417
120 joules.

11
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,293
I've got hydroxychloroquine,
ribavirin...

12
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:33,823
I'm twice the size of SJ General. I
should have twice the amount of tests.

<i>♪ Can't seem to find
home Over the rainbow ♪</i>

15
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:27,182
- I'm a doctor. What happened?
- I don't know. He was running.

16
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,614
And I honked and all of a
sudden, he was in front of my car.

17
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,416
Pedestrian versus
car, GCS five at scene.

18
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:36,190
Rigid abdomen with active
bleeding. Flail chest with pneumo.

19
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:41,465
He needs an ex lap. Now.

20
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:46,736
We've got a massive
hemoperitoneum.

21
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:49,276
I need two large suctions and
lap pads in all four quadrants.

22
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,446
There's a grade-three liver
laceration in right lateral segments.

23
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:59,680
Liver stitch, number-1 chromic, and
a blunt needle and a combat gauze.

24
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,397
What were you doing
on your bike at that hour?

25
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:14,128
Heading into work. Trying to prep
for my budget meeting with Glassman.

26
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:17,699
Mobilize the liver to check for
any associated diaphragm injury.

27
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:19,000
It's the other side of town.

28
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:20,999
I was taking the scenic route.

29
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:22,966
BP's dropping.

30
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:25,410
He's got another bleed. Add
more lap pads and run the bowel.

31
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,382
There's a perforation
near the terminal ileum.

32
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:30,449
Hmm.

33
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,919
Something tore through
the intestinal wall.

34
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:37,816
It's shrapnel.

35
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:39,720
From the accident?

36
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,495
The coat's eroded. It looks
like it's been in there a while.

37
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:46,359
Must have gotten
dislodged in the accident.

38
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:04,382
How does Asher seem to you?

39
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:05,685
He seems fine.

40
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:09,382
Too fine for someone who's
just lost their first patient.

41
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:11,823
I don't have time to worry
about people being too fine.

42
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:12,825
He's faking it.

43
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:15,385
Good. The brain releases
serotonin when you smile

44
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:17,829
even if you're miserable.
I feel better already.

45
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:21,027
Denial is not a proven
strategy for psychological health.

46
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:23,400
Dwelling on things you can't
change doesn't help either.

47
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,248
Twenty-four-year-old
woman came into the ER

48
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,557
complaining of abdominal pain
and headaches and surprise,

49
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:40,712
she's pregnant.

50
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:43,256
Apparently not a happy
surprise. She wants an abortion.

51
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,390
Well, what's wrong with her?

52
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:48,438
I assume you haven't recently
learned the value of sharing,

53
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:50,142
which makes me think
there's another reason

54
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:52,197
you're unloading this onto
the surgical department.

55
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,669
She has a congenital IgA deficiency
and a history of severe infections.

56
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:59,195
She'll need IV antibiotics and
close post-surgical observation.

57
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:02,003
I figured one of your newbies
may as well learn something.

Lea's birthday is tomorrow.

62
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:18,354
There are many cute frogs
and many romantic songs.

63
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,723
I can't decide.

64
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:26,228
It is my first gift
as her boyfriend.

65
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:28,825
It needs to be... awesome.

66
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:33,169
Well, then, maybe singing frogs,
however cute, might be a mistake.

67
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,301
Try something more
personal, romantic.

68
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:42,106
And find a resident who hasn't
done a suction D&C and teach them.

69
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:45,619
Oh, no. No, I'll do it myself.

70
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:50,515
I'm not going to teach anymore.
I'm a good surgeon, I'll do surgery.

71
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,492
Dr. Murphy, part of your
job as a surgeon is to teach.

72
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,529
You can't opt out
because it's difficult.

73
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:58,224
I am opting out
because I'm bad at it.

74
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,858
Well, you can't opt
out for any reason.

75
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:03,734
But I may have given you too
much responsibility too soon.

76
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:07,206
So I will supervise your supervision
until you get the hang of it.

77
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:10,335
Pick someone. Did
you two lose something?

78
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:14,576
Our patient. Rose Babcock.

79
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:17,277
She's post-op from repair
of a distal radius fracture.

80
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,586
Sixties. White hair.

81
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,493
Looks at you like she's
staring into your soul.

82
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:22,716
Does she have a limp?

83
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:23,882
No.

84
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:25,118
Well, I think she does now.

85
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:28,791
Ms. Babcock, did
you fall down again?

86
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:30,262
Oh, no, I'm fine.

87
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:35,132
But there's a poor man in
room 318 who's in a lot of pain.

88
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:37,928
Let's get you back in bed.

89
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,004
Oh.

90
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,509
Yup.

91
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:47,104
Apply a new Tegaderm,
not antibiotic ointment.

92
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:53,919
They breathe.

93
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,748
Don't make us handcuff
you to the bed, Rose.

94
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:59,657
- We charge extra for that.
- Dry the skin more so it'll stick.

95
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:01,327
Okay.

96
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:03,062
You're doing just fine, dear.

97
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:08,869
Heart rate spiking in
the 130s. BP 162 over 95.

98
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:11,200
Are you feeling any
pressure in your chest?

99
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:15,766
No, it's just anxiety. Not
mine. It's one of yours.

100
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:22,374
We're going to pretend, since
it's happening in your chest,

101
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:26,147
that it's yours. Twenty
milligrams IV labetalol.

102
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,381
I'm fine. I'm an empath.

103
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:31,448
I can feel what other
people are feeling.

104
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:34,317
And one of you is
very stressed out.

105
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:41,023
Olivia, stay where you are.
And one milligram of Ativan.

106
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,480
Keep away from me!

107
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:04,414
No! Step back.

108
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:07,552
Sir, you were in an accident.
We're taking care of you.

109
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,624
Stop it. Stop it! No!

110
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,662
Get away from me!

111
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:13,109
- I need you to hold
him down - Now!

112
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:14,465
While I administer Haldol.

113
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:16,435
- Sir, please. Just...
- I'm warning you.

114
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:17,796
This room is being cleared.

115
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:20,064
No one is gonna hurt you.

116
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:22,570
Ben.

117
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,610
You're having a flashback.

118
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,643
You're not in Afghanistan.

119
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:33,948
You're in the hospital.

120
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:36,420
Look around.

121
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:38,452
What do you see?

122
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,270
Zoe?

123
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:55,033
- Yeah. Yeah, baby, it's me.
- Zoe, I couldn't sleep.

124
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:58,004
I went for a run and I...

125
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,038
heard an explosion.

126
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:05,517
I don't... I don't know
what happened after that.

127
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,510
You were hit by a car.

128
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,783
We had to do surgery,
but you're going to be okay.

129
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:12,917
It's okay.

130
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,758
Take him back to his room. Make
sure he didn't open his wound.

131
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,256
I'm sorry.

132
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:35,006
Dr. Murphy?

133
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:43,389
Rose is not your patient.

134
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,588
She was teaching
me about her gift.

135
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:49,754
She says the basis
of empathy is curiosity,

136
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:52,264
which I find curious because...

137
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:54,528
I'm curious about the job
you're supposed to be doing.

138
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,393
Who are you leading
through the D&C?

139
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,698
None of them.

140
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:03,601
The only one who hasn't done
one does not want to. So I will.

141
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,110
Which resident?

142
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:08,312
Wanting to is
irrelevant. It's their job.

143
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:12,614
Wanting to is
irrelevant. It's your job.

144
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,247
I'm a Christian.

145
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,949
Performing an abortion
goes against my beliefs.

146
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:18,457
Okay.

147
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,787
You may encounter
a situation one day

148
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:26,526
where this procedure
could save a woman's life.

149
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:29,694
- Then I hope someone else can...
- And it's my job to make sure

150
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:33,069
you can perform all
surgeries. Including abortions.

151
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,210
So where does that leave us?

152
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,045
I'll do the surgery.

153
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:44,983
I've only done one. I'm sure
there's a lot I still can learn.

154
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,689
Dr. Murphy, you
have a new student.

155
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,726
Get her started running
pre-surgery assessments.

156
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:56,454
Thank you, Olivia. That's the
kind of ambition I like to see.

157
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:00,298
He did three tours.

158
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:03,594
He came home after
he was injured in some...

159
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,936
kind of explosion. I don't
really know what happened.

160
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:10,568
Some... He's tried to tell me
about it several times but he just...

161
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:13,477
- He breaks down.
- When was he diagnosed with PTSD?

162
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,106
Two years ago.

163
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,647
But he hasn't been the
same since he got back.

164
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:22,147
At first, he was...

165
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,448
moody, irritable.

166
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,653
Little things would set him off.

167
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:29,489
Then, the insomnia started.

168
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:33,530
His mind, it's
just never at rest.

169
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,293
The nights are the
worst, you know? He...

170
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:40,802
He gets these
terrible nightmares,

171
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:43,136
flashbacks. Just...

172
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,908
We can't sleep in the
same room anymore.

173
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,341
Make sure he stays off his feet.

174
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,450
Would you like us to
arrange a psych consult?

175
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,081
We've been down that road.

176
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:01,858
Talk therapy, group
therapy, exposure therapy,

177
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,555
endless medications.

178
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,966
Let us know if you
change your mind.

179
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,523
Jillian, I need those
stats on elective surgeries

180
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,889
for my budget
meeting. And a coffee.

181
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,991
Jillian?

182
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,366
She's not there. I
need approval for this.

183
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:17,994
And this.

184
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:22,365
You said I couldn't
give her the frogs.

185
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,938
Oh. You can't
give her this either.

186
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:26,502
You don't know what it is.

187
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,572
I know it would mean more if you
had to leave the building to get it.

188
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:35,113
I would like to do the
suction D&C surgery.

189
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,848
I assume your religious
convictions haven't changed

190
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,154
in the last few hours.

191
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:43,321
No. But I believe I was put
in this program for a reason.

192
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:47,060
So if you think it's important for
me to learn how to do an abortion,

193
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:48,730
then I should learn.

194
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:54,507
Take Jordan to the skills
lab, run the surgery steps.

195
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:56,634
You two will handle
the D&C yourselves.

196
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:57,836
With you.

197
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:03,081
How are you going to supervise
my supervision if you're not there?

198
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,482
I will help you prep
and debrief afterwards.

199
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:08,020
But this patient doesn't
need a gallery of strangers

200
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:10,488
standing around gawking at
her most private experience.

201
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:13,355
Sorry to interrupt. Ben
woke up complaining of pain.

202
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:16,191
- Did you check the incision?
- The pain is in his arm.

203
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:20,424
Now test external
rotation of the shoulder.

204
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,194
We're almost done.

205
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,498
Can you describe the pain?

206
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:29,539
We'll call it a ten.

207
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:33,376
It's been hurting for years. But...
this is... This is something else.

208
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:35,472
How did you injure
your shoulder before?

209
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:39,647
I was in a...

210
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:44,648
I was in a convoy, in Kandahar.

211
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:46,518
And there was a...

212
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:52,759
I... I... I dislocated my...

213
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,960
You don't need to
discuss it with us.

214
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,936
What did you find?

215
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,166
Swelling. Sensitivity
to touch. Discoloration.

216
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,401
- Could be CRPS.
- What is that?

217
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:05,843
Well, it appears the car
accident aggravated a prior injury.

218
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:08,678
You've developed Complex
Regional Pain Syndrome.

219
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:10,910
We'll start you on
Gabapentin and Dilaudid.

220
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,676
Opioids make me a little insane.

221
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,616
We could do a
Stellate Ganglion Block.

222
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:19,456
It's an injection of
anesthetic near the spine

223
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:23,155
that blocks the pain signals
and could also help the PTSD.

224
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:27,362
I've been treated
for PTSD for years.

225
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,293
Why haven't I heard about this?

226
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,201
It's experimental.
But promising.

227
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,863
The procedure comes with risks.

228
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:35,431
Vascular injury,
infection, major hematoma.

229
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:38,068
Dr. Lim, I've been taking a
risk every time I go to sleep.

230
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:42,706
I want to do it.

231
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,845
Stellate Block is an accepted
procedure for the treatment of pain.

232
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:47,318
Which you wouldn't
have suggested

233
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,686
if the patient didn't also
have a mental health condition.

234
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,234
I heard Jordan's
back on the D&C, -

235
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:53,886
in spite of her
righteous indignation.

236
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,258
Is something chirping?

237
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:56,694
I think you're being unfair.

238
00:14:56,763 --> 00:15:00,222
Well, if anyone's being unfair,
it's me. I told Jordan to do it.

239
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,331
I told her we make decisions
that are hard to live with

240
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,395
all the time. We
make them anyway.

241
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,962
And I told her
pissing off the chief

242
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,031
was a very bad way
to start your residency.

243
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:12,148
Glad to hear you're still moonlighting
as Surgical Department Camp Counselor.

244
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:14,613
But I don't mean you
were being unfair to Jordan.

245
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,080
You're being
unfair to the patient.

246
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:18,584
She's facing an emotionally
fraught procedure.

247
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:20,719
She needs the
support of her doctors.

248
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:23,507
And who she's getting is a rookie
who thinks she's committing murder.

249
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,316
And Shaun.

250
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:30,255
I have a point.

251
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,864
I'll lead Jordan through the
D&C myself. You're happy.

252
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,996
Dr. Murphy will be happy.
My cup runneth over.

253
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:41,631
Now get whatever's in that
box out of my department.

254
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:55,144
Morning sickness. Nurse Ella's.

255
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:57,656
Rose claims she can
feel her pregnancy.

256
00:15:57,824 --> 00:16:01,522
She was right about the guy in
Room 318. He had a clot in his ankle.

257
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:03,392
I'm sure she picked up
on some subtle clues,

258
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,728
like the guy moaning
and grasping his ankle.

259
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:09,827
Get a CT to rule out
abdominal injury from her fall.

260
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,406
We're going to insert a
thin needle into your neck

261
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:17,603
so we can inject the
anesthetic. It may sting a bit.

262
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:25,648
Use an in-plane approach
to place the needle

263
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:28,119
between the C6 tubercle
and carotid artery.

264
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,703
You might feel some discomfort.

265
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,204
- What's wrong?
- Zoe's hurt.

266
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:27,512
I'm okay.

267
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,446
Get some ice.
Let me take a look.

268
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,646
- What happened?
- I hit her.

269
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,310
Yeah. I was laying next to him.

270
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:34,877
I know I shouldn't,

271
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:37,788
but the shot just made his pain
feel so much better, I thought...

272
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:41,350
Zo, you didn't do
anything wrong.

273
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:44,828
There was a noise in
the hall. I lashed out...

274
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:45,956
I know.

275
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,867
I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.

276
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,773
Nothing's broken, but I can get
you something for the swelling.

277
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:00,844
No. I'm okay. I'm going to
go home, get cleaned up.

278
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:05,112
I just need some time.

279
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:09,116
I love you.

280
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:23,926
I think we can help Ben.

281
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,166
There have been
some promising results

282
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:28,867
using Vagal Nerve
Stimulation to treat PTSD.

283
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,706
His scarring would make it
impossible to expose and find the nerve

284
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:32,836
without damaging it.

285
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:35,780
Those scars are the
reason that we need to try.

286
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,510
Imagine reliving your worst
nightmare over and over again.

287
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:42,297
Why doesn't anyone around here
want to do the job they were hired for?

288
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,984
What Ben needs is psychological
help. I've ordered a consult.

289
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:47,117
Leave it to the people
who are trained to do it.

290
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:50,341
It sets a bad precedent
to force a resident

291
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:52,236
to do a procedure they're
not comfortable with.

292
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:54,199
Wow, does anyone around
here not have an opinion

293
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:56,098
about who should do
that damn abortion?

294
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:58,831
Jordan had a choice and in my
opinion, she made the right one.

295
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:01,135
It's not a true choice if you
were coerced by your boss.

296
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:02,698
I asked her to do her job.

297
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:05,944
You took an opportunity from
a resident who wants to learn

298
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:07,412
in favor of one who doesn't.

299
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,876
Is this song and dance about
Jordan doing the procedure

300
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:12,180
or your niece not doing it?

301
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:13,842
Neither.

302
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,411
There's a misconception that
Olivia came to St. Bonaventure

303
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,489
because of me.

304
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,524
She's here because
of your reputation.

305
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:24,854
The great Dr. Lim, a masterclass
in technique, professionalism,

306
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,159
empathy.

307
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:28,852
Lately, it doesn't seem
like that reputation holds up.

308
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:37,043
I'm giving you an antibiotic
to prevent infection.

309
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:40,169
The vacuum aspiration
will take about 15 minutes

310
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:42,579
and you'll be numbed
with a local anesthetic.

311
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:45,015
Conscious sedation
is also an option,

312
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,820
but you will need someone
to drive you home afterwards.

313
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:53,323
Do you have any
questions for me?

314
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:00,227
I'm scared.

315
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:14,041
Are you certain you want to
go ahead with the abortion?

316
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:23,048
Yes.

317
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:27,892
Then you don't
have to be scared.

318
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:31,363
You're making the
right decision for you.

319
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:40,734
Give her another 400
micrograms of misoprostol.

320
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:42,274
I'll be back for the procedure.

321
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,380
This doesn't work. I need these
numbers in spreadsheet format.

322
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:48,686
- Sorry. Excuse me.
- Thank you.

323
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:54,211
Dr. Park?

324
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:56,046
Rose's CT was normal.

325
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,281
Get an upper GI barium study.

326
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,485
The first quarter supply
costs you requested.

327
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,620
Also, one of your first
years seems upset.

328
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,928
He's been in the
stairwell for a while.

329
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:10,802
Everything okay in here?

330
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:15,170
I just needed some quiet.

331
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:20,609
Surgeons come into the
stairwell for two reasons:

332
00:21:21,147 --> 00:21:22,843
fire drills or doctor trauma.

333
00:21:23,816 --> 00:21:25,079
You having a fire drill?

334
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:29,749
I just wish we had a more
effective treatment for Ben.

335
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:33,791
His head's so messed
up and we can't help him.

336
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:40,165
I don't think this is about Ben.

337
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:56,110
Have you ever lost a patient
you knew you could've saved?

338
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:06,957
When COVID was at its worst, we
had to cancel all non-urgent procedures.

339
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:10,653
A young mom with a
heart condition was...

340
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,488
more urgent than I thought.

341
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,966
And she died waiting for
me to put her on the schedule.

342
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,308
How do you get past that?

343
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:31,017
You get past it
because that's the job.

344
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:35,915
You will always remember it,

345
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:39,682
and you will eventually
stop reliving it.

346
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,753
How can you be so sure?

347
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:48,763
Because if you don't,
you can't be a surgeon.

348
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:53,838
And I'm pretty sure
you're a surgeon.

349
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:02,338
Should get back to work.

350
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:16,586
Insert the speculum.

351
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,471
Now dilate the cervix.

352
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,043
Begin suction.

353
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:53,098
Begin gentle
suction in the uterus.

354
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:00,833
Is anything wrong?

355
00:24:01,974 --> 00:24:05,206
You're okay. Doctor Allen,
I can take it from here.

356
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:15,010
Don't worry. We're almost
done. You're going to be just fine.

357
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:21,591
You have no idea what that
woman was going through

358
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,822
- and you made it worse for her.
- I know, I didn't...

359
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:26,661
You had an opportunity to opt out
before you walked into that room.

360
00:24:26,732 --> 00:24:28,132
But you agreed to
do the procedure,

361
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:30,762
you took on an obligation to
that patient, and you failed her.

362
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:32,436
If you ever do
anything like that again,

363
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,303
I will have you removed
from my program.

364
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:36,808
Maybe you should be
cleaning bedpans for a while.

365
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,675
Hopefully, there's no
moral objection to that.

366
00:24:48,454 --> 00:24:49,894
Why are there adult
toys on my desk?

367
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:52,721
I've heard good
things about the Llama,

368
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:55,090
but online reviews
aren't always accurate.

369
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,753
Do you have a favorite?

370
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:02,995
They're for Lea. Which one
do you like the most, Claire?

371
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:07,464
Uh...

372
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:11,068
Evidence suggests that trauma
changes the way the brain works.

373
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:13,703
An overactive amygdala can
heighten someone's response

374
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:15,975
to emotional stimuli,
including fear.

375
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:20,084
I think we should consider
amygdala ablation for Ben.

376
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:21,848
That's... crazy.

377
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:25,090
And completely outside the
scope of our care. Where's...

378
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,058
Oh.

379
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:33,791
We're surgeons. We fix physiological
problems, not mental ones.

380
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,664
It is a physiological problem.

381
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:37,635
His brain isn't
functioning properly.

382
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,703
If it was a tumor that was
causing these reactions,

383
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:42,731
- you wouldn't hesitate to remove it.
- But there is no tumor.

384
00:25:42,808 --> 00:25:45,368
You're talking about
inflicting damage on his brain.

385
00:25:45,444 --> 00:25:47,845
He could suffer a stroke,
or come out in a coma,

386
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:49,176
or not come out at all.

387
00:25:49,515 --> 00:25:51,950
If you use a stereotactic
laser approach

388
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:54,629
rather than an open craniotomy,
you would greatly reduce the risks.

389
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:56,451
This is not your case.

390
00:25:56,522 --> 00:25:58,855
You cannot jump into this one
because you don't want to do

391
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:01,484
the one assigned to
you, which is to teach,

392
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,858
which you've made my problem,

393
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:04,928
just like you made Lea's
birthday gifts my problem.

394
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:07,489
You need to grow up and
accept some responsibility.

395
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:35,458
I was diagnosed
with PTSD last year.

396
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:40,363
I kept it mainly private.

397
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:44,127
Melendez really
helped me through it.

398
00:26:45,571 --> 00:26:49,008
It was nice to have
a friend to lean on.

399
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,404
So if you need one...

400
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:08,750
I feel...

401
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:11,390
off.

402
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:14,758
Disconnected.

403
00:27:16,502 --> 00:27:18,300
Like I can't catch my breath.

404
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,306
But...

405
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:24,902
it comes with the job.

406
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:26,911
I'll get over it.

407
00:27:35,621 --> 00:27:36,919
It's Ben.

408
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:41,423
Ben, no one is
going to hurt you.

409
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:45,724
You're having a flashback.

410
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,698
I know where I am.

411
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,908
Every day since I came home,

412
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:59,069
I feel like there's a
monster chasing me.

413
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:01,008
I try to outrun it...

414
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:06,811
but I end up hurting
the one I love the most.

415
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:10,515
I'm a threat to
everyone around me.

416
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:12,820
No, Ben. You just need help.

417
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,687
Nothing helps.

418
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:21,190
I can't smile. I can't laugh. I
can't feel anything but pain.

419
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,668
I make everyone around me...

420
00:28:28,607 --> 00:28:29,666
suffer.

421
00:28:36,248 --> 00:28:40,276
Ben, there's a
surgery that may help.

422
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:05,636
I would like to scrub in on
the amygdala ablation surgery.

423
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,070
Rose said you're feeling
overwhelmed and need...

424
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:11,387
I don't want to hear any more
things that woman has said.

425
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:13,585
Your job was to
supervise your residents.

426
00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:15,814
Why are you here
instead of doing that?

427
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:19,654
You said you were going to
supervise my supervision, but you didn't.

428
00:29:19,725 --> 00:29:21,159
You took over my case.

429
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:24,287
I don't know what I was
supposed to learn, or how.

430
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:28,664
Scrub in.

431
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:36,067
Dr. Murphy, walk Asher
through the probe placement

432
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:38,133
and trajectory to the amygdala.

433
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,740
I will supervise
your supervision.

434
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:48,948
Okay, insert the probe
perpendicular to the cortical surface.

435
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:06,097
Stop. You're off course.
On the current trajectory,

436
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:08,402
you will penetrate a
branch of the choroidal artery

437
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,806
and cause a hemorrhage.
Step away from the probe.

438
00:30:10,876 --> 00:30:14,779
Your job is to
teach, not take over.

439
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:26,714
Adjust the probe one
millimeter inferiorly.

440
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:29,785
Avoid the temporal
horn on your right.

441
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:33,155
I can't see it on
the image guidance.

442
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:38,795
Tell Asher what you see.

443
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:51,548
It should point toward
your 6 o'clock on the y-axis.

444
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:53,209
You have to feel it.

445
00:30:56,121 --> 00:30:57,248
The...

446
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:02,851
The tissue plane along
the parenchyma is smooth.

447
00:31:02,928 --> 00:31:05,193
It should feel like gliding.

448
00:31:14,673 --> 00:31:16,665
You've reached the amygdala.

449
00:31:19,745 --> 00:31:22,044
Ready to begin
thermal laser ablation.

450
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:29,882
Rose's upper GI
and labs are normal.

451
00:31:29,955 --> 00:31:31,595
Should we keep her
another day to observe?

452
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:33,318
No. If she's stable,
let's send her home.

453
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,192
- Okay. I'll have Olivia...
- Open your mouth.

454
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:37,287
Pardon me?

455
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,960
Open your mouth.

456
00:31:44,603 --> 00:31:46,071
- I can, uh...
- Shut your mouth.

457
00:31:48,807 --> 00:31:49,847
There's this rat...

458
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,309
A mouse. A little, dead
mouse in the garage

459
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:54,217
and the big strong man
is afraid to get it out.

460
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,112
Not afraid, disgusted.

461
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:57,821
Neither of us
wants to deal with it,

462
00:31:57,883 --> 00:32:00,148
so we are settling it in
the only responsible way.

463
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:02,847
- A bet...
- A dare. A series of dares, actually.

464
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,412
Whoever wusses
out first has to...

465
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:06,549
Take those things
out of your mouth.

466
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:09,994
I will discharge Rose.
You two go home.

467
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:11,757
- We were just...
- Being idiots at work,

468
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:14,595
while people are sick
and dying. Go home.

469
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,303
All of your tests are normal.
We're discharging you.

470
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:28,543
Right. Because you're psychic.

471
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,809
I'm an empath. Not a psychic.

472
00:32:31,216 --> 00:32:33,879
Whatever the case, I would
suggest you take it easy.

473
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,581
- No drinking, no heavy lifting...
- You have to let it out, dear.

474
00:32:37,556 --> 00:32:39,115
It was you.

475
00:32:39,191 --> 00:32:41,319
You made my heart rate spike.

476
00:32:42,828 --> 00:32:44,319
You're about to implode.

477
00:32:47,499 --> 00:32:50,401
There's nothing
wrong with you... or me.

478
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:54,836
Code Blue!

479
00:33:32,811 --> 00:33:33,811
Yeah.

480
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:42,051
Dr. Lim, my behavior yesterday
was inexcusable and unprofessional.

481
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:45,986
I let you down, I
let the patient down.

482
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:51,018
I am deeply sorry, and I
promise it will not happen again.

483
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:56,028
You let your personal judgment
get in the way of doing your job.

484
00:33:57,669 --> 00:33:59,433
You're right, that
is inexcusable.

485
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:06,702
You said I had no idea what
the patient was going through.

486
00:34:07,846 --> 00:34:10,839
The truth is, I kind of do.

487
00:34:14,019 --> 00:34:17,751
Scared, alone, afraid
of anyone finding out.

488
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:25,520
I chose my career over
motherhood, over my faith.

489
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:28,894
But I don't regret it.

490
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:36,007
And I know God forgave
me because I get to be here,

491
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:39,067
living my dream
of being a doctor.

492
00:34:44,716 --> 00:34:47,618
But I purposely try
not to think about it.

493
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,395
You're off scut duty.

494
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:59,124
- That's not why I...
- Take it.

495
00:35:07,372 --> 00:35:08,965
My name is Benjamin Alan Harris.

496
00:35:09,908 --> 00:35:13,640
I'm in Saint Bonaventure
Hospital in San Jose.

497
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,442
Language and memory
appear to be intact.

498
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:19,450
And your motor
function is normal.

499
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:21,611
But that doesn't mean
it worked, does it?

500
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:23,882
No. We'll have to do an fMRl

501
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,618
to see how you respond
to fear-inducing stimuli.

502
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:28,689
But we'll let you rest for now.

503
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:31,394
I'm not going to rest
until I know I'm better.

504
00:35:34,032 --> 00:35:36,524
I want you to know
how I got these scars.

505
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:39,366
No, not now. Just
give yourself time.

506
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:42,271
I was in a convoy, in Kandahar.

507
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:47,267
I was in a Husky, a
big vehicle, at the front.

508
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:49,610
Ben, you don't have to do this.

509
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:51,115
Ronnie was driving.

510
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:55,549
He was telling me a story,
something about a goat at the base,

511
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,816
or maybe it was a
chicken, I don't know, but...

512
00:36:00,225 --> 00:36:01,225
we were laughing.

513
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:09,628
And then the world was on fire.

514
00:36:19,044 --> 00:36:20,512
It's the Husky's job

515
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:24,306
to spot IEDs.

516
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:31,820
And I missed one.

517
00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:38,654
I can't see their faces.

518
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:42,499
Just...

519
00:36:43,902 --> 00:36:44,902
bodies.

520
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,037
Everywhere.

521
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:56,412
Dying alone,
without their families.

522
00:36:58,283 --> 00:37:00,115
All I could do was
hold their hand.

523
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,395
Are you okay, Ben?

524
00:37:49,134 --> 00:37:52,536
<i>♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪</i>

525
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:56,666
<i>♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪</i>

526
00:37:56,741 --> 00:38:01,577

527
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,278
<i>♪ Happy Birthday ♪</i>

528
00:38:03,348 --> 00:38:04,577
Fun day.

529
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:06,345
<i>♪ To you ♪</i>

530
00:38:07,352 --> 00:38:08,547
What do you mean?

531
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,414
We have a diagnosis.

532
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,671
I thought I felt someone here.

533
00:38:30,175 --> 00:38:31,666
You've had a long day.

534
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,210
You have Prinzmetal's
Angina, Rose.

535
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:39,980
A heart condition,
but it's very treatable.

536
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:42,384
It explains all your symptoms.

537
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:44,583
And it's exacerbated by stress,

538
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,887
which is likely what
caused your heart attack.

539
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:51,185
You need to stop seeking
out other people's pain.

540
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:53,327
It's literally killing you.

541
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,526
You're the chief of surgery.

542
00:38:58,603 --> 00:39:01,038
You could have sent
somebody else to tell me this.

543
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,805
Sure. But then I'd miss
my chance to gloat.

544
00:39:06,311 --> 00:39:08,143
You're here because
you're hurting.

545
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:10,645
And you don't know
where else to go.

546
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:15,415
Go ahead. Use your magic.

547
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:18,356
Tell me, what's wrong with me?

548
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,687
How do I stop feeling like this?

549
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:25,363
It doesn't work that way.

550
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,423
I don't have a magic wand.

551
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:31,502
I can only hold up a mirror.

552
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:36,302
Make you slow down and
look at the parts of yourself

553
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,206
that you've been
trying to ignore.

554
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:41,913
Because you're afraid if you
look too closely, you'll break.

555
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:50,887
Maybe you will. I don't know.
Maybe breaking is the point.

556
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:57,996
You can't outrun
your pain, Dr. Lim.

557
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,190
If you keep trying,
it's going to kill you.

558
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,667
<i>Time of death...</i>

559
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:18,942
