1
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:08,900
- You said the pain was intense?
- Yeah, it was sharp on both sides.

2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,500
And it didn't last long?

3
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:12,644
Just a few minutes.

4
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:16,048
- And nothing in the 24 hours since then?
- Mm-mm.

5
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,641
My OB said it was probably
round ligament pain.

6
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,711
Yeah, that's basically
growing pains.

7
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:23,290
Your uterus is expanding,
so do your ligaments.

8
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,849
Normal fetal heart
rate and movement,

9
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:29,861
your BP is perfect, and
everything seems normal.

10
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:33,398
Complications and
miscarriage are also normal.

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,992
Lea's OB did not
consider every possibility.

12
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:38,402
Which is why we're
here. Shaun made a list.

13
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:42,533
I'm pretty sure he's not going to
sleep until every possibility is ruled out.

14
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:45,101
I categorized every
medical complication

15
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:47,408
that could negatively
impact Lea or the baby,

16
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:49,107
then sorted by
Case Fatality Risk.

17
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:53,917
I'll get started on the tests.

18
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:57,689
Shortness of breath, pulse ox
and respiratory rate are dropping.

19
00:00:57,758 --> 00:00:59,351
She needs oxygen.
Maxine Stanley,

20
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:01,224
87 years young. Passed
out on the dance floor

21
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:03,888
at a cocktail fundraiser
for the Art Deco Society.

22
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,200
Art Nouveau.

23
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:10,261
Oh.

24
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:13,036
- She's in V-fib.
- Getting the crash cart.

25
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:14,938
Have a look at her bracelet.

26
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:16,533
The vintage
Lalique? It's stunning.

27
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,079
Other wrist. Her medical
bracelet. She signed a DNR.

28
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:23,308
If we don't do anything,
she'll go asystolic.

29
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:24,248
I know.

30
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:26,081
- Can't we just...
- No.

31
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:30,884
Epinephrine? Epinephrine doesn't qualify
as extraordinary life saving measures.

32
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:32,426
She has a DNR for a reason.

33
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:48,737
Time of death, 2...

34
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:54,772
She has no heartbeat,
but her pressure is rising.

35
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,816
- Could machines be screwing up?
- All of them?

36
00:01:58,085 --> 00:01:59,986
Her oxygen levels
are climbing to over 90.

37
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:03,248
I'm hearing blood flow.

38
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:08,326
Wow.

39
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:10,997
I'm alive?

40
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,631
Which one of you bozos did this?

41
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:37,992
Debbie ask me to
bring this for the baby.

42
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:40,687
Stuffed toys aren't safe for
infants under 12 months old.

43
00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:42,729
They increase the
risk of suffocation.

44
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:45,822
I'll tell her you
said, "Thank you."

45
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:48,333
- You should be at work.
- Yeah.

46
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:52,938
But you're not. So you
must be here for a reason?

47
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:56,534
Claire must have called
you? She's worried about Lea.

48
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:58,043
You got some of that right.

49
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:01,980
Except that Lea
is fine. You're not.

50
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,009
Shaun, you gotta relax.

51
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:07,554
No... No one expecting
a baby should relax.

52
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,850
There are many things
that could go wrong.

53
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:13,017
Okay, so after the baby's
born, then you can relax?

54
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:18,259
N... No. The baby will be
helpless, need us for everything.

55
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,766
So once the baby learns
how to feed itself and dress,

56
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,460
- then you can relax?
- No.

57
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,698
Is my point becoming
at all obvious?

58
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:28,501
That I'm never going
to relax ever again?

59
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:30,977
Kind of. Yeah.

60
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:35,543
Shaun, this should be the most
amazing moment of your life.

61
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,881
Every parent will tell
you the same thing.

62
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:40,419
If you blink, you're gonna
miss it, and you're blinking.

63
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:45,186
You're nervous and you're
scared when you should be excited.

64
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,795
No signs of preterm
labor, and tests on your liver

65
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,095
ruled out obstetric cholestasis,

66
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:57,728
and it's not
twin-twin transfusion

67
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:59,932
because you're
officially not having twins.

68
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:04,107
Turns out having a baby with a
medical genius has a downside.

69
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:07,438
If there is a problem, I'd rather
be here than anywhere else.

70
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:10,283
Gotta take care
of this little girl.

71
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:12,712
Is the transducer secure?

72
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:14,277
I just checked it, why?

73
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,413
The baby's heart
rate's mildly bradycardic.

74
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:22,461
Heart rate fluctuates with activity,
and you've been off your feet for a while.

75
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:27,833
But if Shaun were here, he would
check a transvaginal ultrasound.

76
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:28,958
Let's get it set up.

77
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:37,175
Good news. The arrhythmia
didn't do a lot of damage...

78
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:41,146
Three things I can't
tolerate: lactose, cargo pants,

79
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:43,945
and my wishes being ignored.

80
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,281
I can assure you, we did
not disregard your DNR.

81
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:47,184
Then who did?

82
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:51,122
It wasn't a "who." You were
treated for lung cancer recently?

83
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:56,152
Didn't work. All chemo did was make
me puke up any decent meal I ate.

84
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,698
You also had a lobectomy
to remove the tumors.

85
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,165
They implanted a cardiac device.

86
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:03,135
A pacemaker. So I
wouldn't die on the table.

87
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:07,265
It's not a pacemaker, it's basically
a miniature pump inside your heart.

88
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,639
If your heart
stops, it takes over.

89
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:13,571
Can you turn it off?

90
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,951
Then take it out.

91
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,724
Mm. I love it.

92
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:27,090
It's too big for an
infant to swallow,

93
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,322
which means it's only
moderately hazardous.

94
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:31,331
Most good things in life are.

95
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:33,629
Someday we'll tell our
daughter how Dr. Ted

96
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,965
and Dr. Dad both kept her safe.

97
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:43,735
We have found something.

98
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:48,013
You have Type 2 Vasa previa.

99
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:51,708
It's when the fetal blood
vessels run across the cervix,

100
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:53,650
making them
extremely vulnerable.

101
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:57,488
Now, they could
rupture at any time,

102
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:01,995
definitely when your water breaks,
but also under other added stress.

103
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,359
And if that were to happen,
how bad would it be?

104
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:07,759
We...

105
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:10,761
would lose the baby.

106
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:25,715
There's a small secondary placental
lobe and multiple vessels at risk.

107
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:26,878
Gestational age?

108
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:29,218
Twenty-two weeks, two
weeks short of viability.

109
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:30,723
C-section is not an option.

110
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:36,087
I suggest fetoscopic laser
ablation to stabilize the vessels

111
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:37,528
and avoid fetal exsanguination.

112
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:39,566
It's very risky but has
the highest potential

113
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,362
to avoid elective prematurity.

114
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:43,926
I wrote a preliminary surgical
plan. Should we review it?

115
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:46,438
- Well, I'm familiar with the procedure.
- Good.

116
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:49,976
Since you're the head of
surgery, you can take the lead.

117
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,409
I will assist, and Claire
showed excellent judgment

118
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,812
ordering the ultrasound,
so I would like her to join us.

119
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,976
Also, Jordan has a
calming bedside manner.

120
00:06:58,752 --> 00:06:59,981
This is a good team.

121
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,554
I don't disagree.

122
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,254
Except you can't be on it.

123
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:09,761
Yes, I can. I
reviewed the rules.

124
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:13,823
It is a conflict of interest for doctors
to operate on family members.

125
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,494
Lea and I are not
married, so is no conflict.

126
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,266
Shaun, Lea is
carrying your child.

127
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:22,776
- We aren't operating on the child.
- You're citing technicalities?

128
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:25,641
- I am citing the rules.
- And why are those rules in place?

129
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:28,010
So that people with
emotional conflicts don't get in...

130
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,084
Then the rule should have
said that. It doesn't. It just says...

131
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:34,815
Shaun. I care about you and Lea
too much to put your baby's life at risk

132
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,514
just to make you feel useful.

133
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:47,729
You are the president of the
hospital, you can overrule Dr. Lim.

134
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:48,860
I agree with Lim.

135
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:52,963
Everyone, including you, is always
telling me I'm not emotional enough,

136
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,668
and now you are saying
that I am too emotional?

137
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:58,244
Are you not angry
right now, Shaun?

138
00:07:58,845 --> 00:07:59,845
Are you not scared?

139
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:04,182
You're as emotional as anyone.
Maybe you don't have access to it.

140
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:07,015
Maybe you don't understand.
Well, nobody understands it.

141
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,884
It's just that that's
not the issue.

142
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:15,451
If I hadn't been scared,
we wouldn't be here,

143
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:19,794
I wouldn't have ordered the tests,
and Lea would have lost the baby.

144
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:22,832
My emotion helped.

145
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,040
Dr. Lim made the right call.

146
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:34,337
Considering Maxine's age,

147
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:37,680
stopping her heart and placing
her on bypass is way too risky.

148
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,681
What about robotic
assisted surgery?

149
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:44,383
Adapt the approach used in
cardiac tumors to remove the device

150
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:45,982
while her heart's still beating.

151
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:49,154
I'm sorry, but should we really
be operating on this woman at all?

152
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:51,061
A DNR is one thing,

153
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:54,066
but now we're considering an
experimental elective surgery

154
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:56,602
for the sole purpose of
facilitating the patient's death.

155
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,865
The patient agreed to
the device to save her life,

156
00:08:58,938 --> 00:08:59,938
not prolong her death.

157
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:02,703
Is that what we're doing when
we treat terminally ill patients?

158
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:06,210
- She's making a mistake.
- She's making a choice.

159
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:09,111
- Which is hers to make.
- But it doesn't make sense.

160
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,844
She's more full of life than any
patient I've treated this month.

161
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:15,082
So talk to her. Make
her change her mind,

162
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,547
or maybe she'll change yours.

163
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:03,664
I love you too.

164
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:13,270
Pong. I've been waiting
for that Red Dragon.

165
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:20,384
You're ready for your
close-up, Ms. Stanley.

166
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:24,117
A <i>Sunset Boulevard</i> reference.
And you were born, what,

167
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,988
- ten years ago?
- Mm.

168
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:30,086
I've never seen it, but my
Bubbe... Uh, grandmother,

169
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:32,189
used to say it all the time.

170
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,324
She's the one who
taught me Mahjong.

171
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:37,165
Well, was she as
naive as you think I am?

172
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,969
You have better things
to do, young man.

173
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,440
And at this point in my life, I
don't need any new friends.

174
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:51,107
Do you want to die?

175
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:55,622
Something only the young would
ask, thinking there's actually an option.

176
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:59,352
Well, sometimes, if you're
lucky, there's a choice about when.

177
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,820
And sometimes, if you're really
lucky, there's a choice about how.

178
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,328
I want to die on
the dance floor...

179
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:11,865
with a song in my
heart, a drink in my hand.

180
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:16,238
You want me to die a
few months later, in pain,

181
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,312
not knowing who I
am or where I am.

182
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,677
Forgive me for not saying
thanks for the opportunity.

183
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,216
Ah.

184
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:27,446
Mahjong.

185
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,226
Feels weird, right?

186
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:43,969
Watching other
people do your job

187
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,063
is like being the understudy
in a Broadway show.

188
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:49,474
Or a couple college musicals.
Basically the same thing.

189
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,773
I should be part of
the surgical team.

190
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:55,542
I have studied every aspect
of this surgery extensively.

191
00:11:57,183 --> 00:12:00,278
You know, I never expected to
take you seriously as a surgeon.

192
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:05,017
I never saw you as competition until
that aortic dissection our second year.

193
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:08,895
There was surprise
clotting in the false lumen.

194
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:10,691
Which you performed flawlessly.

195
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:13,130
That's when I realized
I'd underestimated you.

196
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:17,598
Just like Dr. Lim is
underestimating me now.

197
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:22,266
No, Shaun. You didn't
become a better doctor

198
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,276
because of that
surgery with Melendez.

199
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:27,279
I became less of an
idiot, and finally realized

200
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,942
I wasn't the only person here
capable of doing great work.

201
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:35,719
Lea's in good hands, even
if they're not your hands.

202
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,478
The baby is fine.

203
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:09,144
Dr. Lim did an excellent job.
So did Claire and Dr. Allen.

204
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:13,552
The vessel is healing,
but still vulnerable.

205
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:17,358
Also, the baby needs steroids
to speed lung development.

206
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,262
We will recheck the
ultrasound in 24 and 48 hours.

207
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:23,201
Until then, all we can
do is watch and wait.

208
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:29,372
At least I know the
password to the good Wi-Fi.

209
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:41,182
- You okay?
- If you're researching

210
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,847
- which steroid is most effective...
- I'm not.

211
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:47,586
I'm trying to take my mind off of
the baby and what can go wrong,

212
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,720
and all the other things
I can do nothing about

213
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:53,596
and focus on something
I can do well, my job.

214
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:00,667
Is that helping?

215
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:03,408
It could be.

216
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:15,348
Go do your job.

217
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:33,034
Robotic-assisted left
anterior thoracoscopic

218
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:34,767
removal of a cardiac device.

219
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,934
Who wants to write
the paper with me?

220
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,946
Assuming it works.

221
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,412
Shaun? I wasn't aware
you'd be joining us.

222
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:49,280
This surgery is interesting
and very complicated

223
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,051
and I don't care
about the patient.

224
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,886
It seems like an
excellent distraction.

225
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,662
We could use
another set of eyes.

226
00:14:57,663 --> 00:15:00,064
I'm sorry about Lea. If
there's anything I can do...

227
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,658
No, you can't. As
a first-year resident,

228
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,761
you're one of the least
qualified doctors here.

229
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:08,034
There's more scarring around the
device than the imaging showed.

230
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:10,941
We're going to need to free
it before we can remove it.

231
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:14,377
Clamp is loaded, let's begin
with the outflow cannula.

232
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:16,279
We'll see if our
patient can tolerate it.

233
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,560
Vitals are stable. EKG is good.

234
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:30,786
EKG is good. This is excellent.

235
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:33,799
I am completely focused,
not thinking about Lea,

236
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,698
or how we could lose the baby.

237
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:43,508
Fetal heart rate is 125,
Mom's BP is 110 over 60,

238
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,907
vitals are normal.

239
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:47,947
There was some fluid leakage
so Dr. Allen checked for PROM.

240
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:49,710
Negative, and no contractions.

241
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,775
Let's confirm it's amniotic
fluid, then test for an L&S ratio

242
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:55,321
to see how the lungs are
responding to the steroids.

243
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,955
- How do you feel?
- I don't speak doctor,

244
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:02,985
but if I were a car, "fluid
leakage" would be a problem.

245
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,231
Amniotic fluid can leak
slightly after surgery,

246
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,427
it's just something for
us to keep an eye on.

247
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:11,027
Right. Wait and see.

248
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:16,503
Where is Dr. Ted?

249
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:19,135
- Who?
- The toy Shaun brought for the baby.

250
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:21,305
What mother loses her
baby's first teddy bear?

251
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,780
It's fine, one of the nurses...

252
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:25,182
- No, it's not. It just...
- He's right here.

253
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:29,254
Thank you.

254
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:39,159
Being in a hospital,
trying to protect your child,

255
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:42,758
is a terrifying,
awful, lonely feeling,

256
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,395
and there's nothing as a
doctor I can say to make it better.

257
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:50,800
But as your friend, I can let
you know you're not alone.

258
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,045
Isabel and I have been
trying to have a family.

259
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,985
I've almost lost track
of how many IVF cycles.

260
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:02,985
People come over
and ask how it's going.

261
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:05,786
We say, "Getting close,"
whatever that means.

262
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:09,852
Mostly it's just an answer designed
to get people to stop asking questions.

263
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:12,717
<i>I've been scared
since I was a kid.</i>

264
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:16,799
If I could just be better,

265
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:20,863
a better... Better daughter, a
better student, a better doctor,

266
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,500
then I could stop bad
things from happening.

267
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:28,371
But when Melendez
died, I finally realized

268
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:32,013
that life is not something
you're supposed to control.

269
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,080
It's something you're
supposed to share.

270
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:39,552
<i>Eight months pregnant, Mia
and I had everything planned.</i>

271
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,322
Bags packed, alternate
routes to the hospital.

272
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:45,431
Mia's water breaks at the mall.

273
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,458
Nothing like the way
it was supposed to go,

274
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,200
and it was the
best day of my life.

275
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:55,137
I thought I was ready,
but when I lost Junior...

276
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:59,478
It took a long time for
me to stop blaming myself.

277
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:04,281
A year later, I got
a cat. That helped.

278
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:07,049
You lost a child,
and you got a cat?

279
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:09,383
Junior was my tortoise.

280
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:11,784
- Oh.
- First pet I ever owned.

281
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,284
That should've been the
beginning of the story, Dr. Allen.

282
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:17,658
I wasn't the one who
left the gate open.

283
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:20,094
Your tortoise ran away?

284
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:34,111
Your amniotic fluid
levels are stable.

285
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,776
That is good. We need a plan in
case your water breaks at the mall.

286
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:41,012
I take it that's a specific
concern you heard about from...

287
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,680
- Dr. Park says his wife...
- Stop talking to people.

288
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:50,024
Okay. There are three surgeries I'm
thinking of using to distract me next.

289
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,689
One is a gallbladder removal,
which sounds very boring,

290
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,825
- but it...
- Shaun. What...

291
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:03,306
Lower extremity swelling
and shortness of breath

292
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:05,139
are symptoms of a
pulmonary embolism.

293
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:06,211
Page Dr. Browne!

294
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:14,113
Congratulations, Mrs. Stanley,
the surgery was a success.

295
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,549
Success feels like I've
been run over by a truck.

296
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:18,818
Surgery takes a toll.

297
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,619
You'll get a set of
instructions for post-op care.

298
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,959
Healthy food choices,
limiting activities.

299
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,966
And I can throw those
instructions in the trash for you,

300
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:29,559
- or you can do that.
- We'll give you something for the pain,

301
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,349
and some antibiotics for a small
infection around the surgical site.

302
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:34,638
You'll be back to the
dance floor, blood pressure

303
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,370
and erratic heart
rhythm be damned.

304
00:19:45,084 --> 00:19:46,084
Let me.

305
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:51,190
I don't turn over Rouge
Dior to just anyone.

306
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:56,054
Thank you for the
vote of confidence.

307
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,709
Hmm. Nice job.

308
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:11,841
Same Bubbe.

309
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:20,047
So, Dr. Wolke, what's
on your agenda this time?

310
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:22,679
This time, I just like you.

311
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,218
So, what are you going to do?

312
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,385
You going to keep going
to Art Nouveau parties?

313
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:29,359
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

314
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:33,422
It's not a bad thing. It's
just not a meaningful thing.

315
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:38,437
My Bubbe died when
I was in med school.

316
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:42,034
I can't tell you what I'd give
for a little more time with her.

317
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,106
May her memories be a blessing.

318
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:53,315
Family's important.

319
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:56,585
I have a favorite nephew.

320
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,252
It'll be nice to spend
more time with him.

321
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:04,329
And a few others.

322
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:10,435
There.

323
00:21:10,903 --> 00:21:13,896
The clot is in the lower
right pulmonary artery.

324
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:17,443
It's small. Could we
use a tPA to dissolve it?

325
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:20,103
No, anticoagulants are
too risky during pregnancy.

326
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:24,273
Maybe we just keep an eye on the
clot and hope it breaks up on its own.

327
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,317
Bed rest increases the
likelihood of more clots.

328
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,911
I think we should
insert an IVC filter.

329
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:32,959
That would trap future clots
before they get to the lungs.

330
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:35,550
It's hard to know what the
stress of another procedure will do,

331
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,187
but I think we should risk it.

332
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:39,932
Shaun? What do you think?

333
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:47,065
Trust your judgment.

334
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:54,609
Hey. Have you seen Dr. Andrews?

335
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,600
I want to see if he'll talk
to our oncology group

336
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,649
about enrolling Mrs.
Stanley into a clinical trial.

337
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:00,764
What happened to dancing
and drinking until she dies?

338
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:05,819
Well, I think I sold her on a
little pain for a little more life.

339
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:07,484
That's... great.

340
00:22:07,593 --> 00:22:09,585
Which one of your
patients rented the taco truck

341
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,187
that's blocking
the clinic entrance?

342
00:22:11,297 --> 00:22:13,357
If they're serving
carnitas, I want in.

343
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:20,828
<i>♪ I'm gonna live till I die ♪</i>

344
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:24,172
<i>♪ I'm gonna laugh
'stead of cry ♪</i>

345
00:22:24,243 --> 00:22:28,203
<i>♪ I'm gonna take the town
And turn it upside down... ♪</i>

346
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:31,910
Doctors, welcome to
my going away soiree.

347
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,646
If you want some beads, you're
going to have to show a little...

348
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,720
Not happening, Maxine.

349
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:38,747
And as much as we understand
your desire to get back to partying,

350
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,698
- we have hospital rules about...
- Oh, sue me.

351
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:43,160
Or more accurately,
sue my estate.

352
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,825
I am sorry about your
grandmother, Asher.

353
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:51,726
But what you missed isn't more
time. It was a chance to say goodbye.

354
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:55,004
Thank you for giving
me that chance.

355
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:58,767
I've decided to
refuse the antibiotics.

356
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:03,348
Without antibiotics, you'll develop
sepsis and be in cardiogenic shock

357
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:04,747
in as little as 24 hours.

358
00:23:08,287 --> 00:23:11,348
I don't understand.
Why are you doing this?

359
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:14,860
Because it's my life, all of it.

360
00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:18,528
Including the ending.

361
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:34,877
Placing an IVC filter
is a safe procedure

362
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:39,749
with a very low complication rate,
and Claire is an excellent doctor.

363
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:43,613
Shaun...

364
00:23:45,324 --> 00:23:47,384
it's okay to be scared.

365
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:51,088
But it's not helpful.

366
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:53,796
I want to make things better.

367
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:57,567
I don't know how.

368
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:05,910
Look.

369
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,742
That's going to be us.

370
00:24:11,717 --> 00:24:13,481
You don't need to
fix things, Shaun.

371
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:18,080
Just... believe with me that
we're going to get through this.

372
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:20,285
And that the three
of us are going home.

373
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:35,764
Somebody needs to check
your oxygen, young lady,

374
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,935
- because you're not making any sense.
- I told you.

375
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:42,471
I am not delirious, Dr. Glassman, I
just happen to have my own opinion.

376
00:24:42,548 --> 00:24:45,347
It's not a matter of opinion,
it's a matter of absolute fact.

377
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:48,353
Ted Williams was the greatest
baseball player of all time.

378
00:24:48,454 --> 00:24:51,515
- End of discussion. Full stop.
- Ted Williams was good.

379
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:53,558
Not exactly a hot take,

380
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:56,823
but John Paciorek beat
Ted Williams like a drum.

381
00:24:56,895 --> 00:25:01,162
Only player to bat 1,000
in Major League Baseball.

382
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:02,529
- Now you'll say that...
- I am.

383
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:05,331
- John Paciorek only played one game.
- Played one game! Right.

384
00:25:05,404 --> 00:25:09,569
And I'm going to say baseball
wasn't fully integrated until 1959,

385
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:12,008
a year before Williams retired.

386
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:14,069
Numbers aren't
everything, Dr. Glassman.

387
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:18,207
More does not mean better.
Not in life, not in baseball...

388
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:20,286
Maybe in tacos.

389
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:23,811
I'm sorry, why are we
talking baseball and tacos?

390
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:26,324
- Have you had one?
- I've had four, and they are wonderful.

391
00:25:26,392 --> 00:25:28,190
And you would make
an excellent lawyer.

392
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:30,690
You know, I haven't
had this much tongue

393
00:25:30,763 --> 00:25:32,322
in my mouth since Woodstock.

394
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:35,727
Well, some of us think that
you might be a little crazy.

395
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:36,995
A little.

396
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:40,096
Some people can't tell the
difference between crazy and happy.

397
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:43,840
Either way, you're perfectly
capable of making your own decision.

398
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:46,174
Now I'm going to
leave this lovely party.

399
00:25:47,246 --> 00:25:48,373
Excuse me.

400
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:52,847
Just do me one favor, will
you? Keep the volume down.

401
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:58,047
It was a pleasure to meet you.

402
00:25:58,123 --> 00:26:00,854
Pleasure to meet you. Thank you.

403
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,135
- Are those Maxine's new ABG results?
- No.

404
00:26:21,647 --> 00:26:22,647
If you want to talk...

405
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:25,843
Why are you so upset about
Mrs. Stanley refusing treatment?

406
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:31,786
She has terminal cancer, she
is dying. Doctors can't fix that.

407
00:26:36,662 --> 00:26:40,565
I know my family loved
me, but they didn't... see me.

408
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:44,097
Except my grandmother.

409
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:47,396
She'd catch my eye
at Shabbat dinner

410
00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:49,601
and make some ridiculous face.

411
00:26:49,675 --> 00:26:53,134
So I'd laugh and get sent to my
room, and that's where I'd find it...

412
00:26:53,245 --> 00:26:56,977
a book or music or something...

413
00:26:58,016 --> 00:27:00,315
verboten she thought I'd like.

414
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:04,646
She passed away a few years ago.

415
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:08,391
More time would have meant...

416
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:12,096
everything.

417
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,793
Time is hope.

418
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:22,804
ABG results for
Mrs. Maxine Stanley.

419
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,580
Right before
inserting the IVC filter,

420
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:46,284
I ordered a non-stress test

421
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,519
to make sure the baby
could tolerate the procedure.

422
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:52,892
That's when I noticed the heart rate
had been getting progressively slower.

423
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:58,801
So after we implanted the filter,
I ordered a Doppler ultrasound.

424
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:04,404
The tracing of the umbilical artery
was dampened with flow reversal.

425
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:09,738
There wasn't just one
clot, Shaun, there were two.

426
00:29:10,282 --> 00:29:13,719
One we couldn't see because it
was lodged in the umbilical artery.

427
00:29:16,655 --> 00:29:19,215
Maybe I made a mistake...
or I missed something.

428
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:23,058
I really, really want to be
wrong about this, Shaun.

429
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,121
You aren't wrong.

430
00:29:29,468 --> 00:29:33,166
I saw the test results
on the amniotic fluid.

431
00:29:35,674 --> 00:29:38,166
The lungs aren't
responding to the steroids.

432
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:39,575
The baby can't survive.

433
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:46,917
I'm sorry.

434
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:51,079
Did you talk to Lea?

435
00:29:51,757 --> 00:29:52,757
No.

436
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:59,955
I couldn't protect Lea.

437
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:08,197
The only thing I can do for
her now is give her more time...

438
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:12,009
to hope.

439
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:18,115
I don't think you're
doing this for Lea.

440
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:23,783
I think you're protecting yourself
from the pain of watching her pain.

441
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:39,531
Would you like me to be there?

442
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,474
No. Thank you.

443
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:16,260
Crap.

444
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,773
There was nothing
anyone could have done

445
00:32:27,846 --> 00:32:29,314
that would have
made any difference.

446
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:33,147
And nothing about this
affects your chances

447
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:34,844
of having a healthy baby later.

448
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:40,990
What do we do now?

449
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:48,131
Medically, you have two choices.
You can be sedated and have a D&C.

450
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:53,227
Or some people decide to induce
labor so they can hold their child.

451
00:32:59,878 --> 00:33:00,878
Uh...

452
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,979
- Could you give us a minute?
- Of course.

453
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:13,858
Do you...

454
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:17,759
- want to discuss risks and benefits?
- No.

455
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:20,388
I don't need any
more information.

456
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,763
We've lost her.

457
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:34,976
We lost her, and this isn't about
medical questions anymore.

458
00:33:42,821 --> 00:33:45,916
I can't go into labor and
not leave here with our baby.

459
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:03,934
Remarkable. Swelling is
down, trends are improving...

460
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,807
your infection appears
to be clearing on its own.

461
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,544
Apparently, life isn't
done with you yet.

462
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:16,320
Yesterday was one of the...

463
00:34:16,922 --> 00:34:20,859
the best days I've
had in a long time.

464
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,460
Not because of the party.

465
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:26,559
Because of the memories.

466
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:30,898
Midnight taco runs with
my college roommates.

467
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:34,838
My sister messing up the
words to my favorite song.

468
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:38,599
Arguing with my husband...

469
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:42,110
who served the best margaritas.

470
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:47,742
I... I've had a
wonderful life and...

471
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,111
with wonderful people.

472
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:53,586
Maxine, there's no reason
you can't have more of that.

473
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:57,494
They're gone.

474
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:03,796
And now, I, uh...

475
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:08,005
I have to go home alone.

476
00:35:23,655 --> 00:35:27,990
Pretty incredible that a woman
of her age, ravaged by cancer,

477
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:30,821
could fight off an
infection overnight.

478
00:35:30,929 --> 00:35:35,390
If I were a religious man, I'd say,
"Wow, that's... That's a miracle."

479
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,694
So either I should go join a
church or a temple or a mosque

480
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:43,036
or someone slipped antibiotics
into Maxine Stanley's IV,

481
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,906
antibiotics which she specifically
asked us not to give her.

482
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,173
Don't say anything. Not a word.

483
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,177
Say something stupid like a confession,
and I'm going to have to fire you

484
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:56,286
right on the spot.

485
00:35:56,688 --> 00:35:58,850
Not to mention fending off
a lawsuit, which we would,

486
00:35:58,957 --> 00:36:01,324
and most certainly should, lose.

487
00:36:04,696 --> 00:36:07,860
More importantly, none of
this helps Maxine. Does it?

488
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:11,168
So, what happens now?

489
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:13,695
I don't know.

490
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:20,968
Let's just say for the sake
of it that you know this doctor.

491
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:25,206
Would they feel at all guilty?

492
00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:28,819
Yes.

493
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:30,354
Why?

494
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:33,052
Because she's a
good woman and...

495
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:38,523
it was her decision.

496
00:36:39,064 --> 00:36:42,057
You knew it was her decision.
You were told it was her decision.

497
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:45,729
You didn't listen. What makes you
think next time will be any different?

498
00:36:45,837 --> 00:36:48,830
Because I saw her this morning.
And for the first time I saw...

499
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:51,968
her pain.

500
00:37:03,088 --> 00:37:04,088
Okay.

501
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,256
You're going to have
to make this right.

502
00:37:58,243 --> 00:37:59,243
Hey.

503
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:36,013
I'm sorry things didn't
turn out like you wanted.

504
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:38,081
It's okay.

505
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:43,885
Lots of great books
have... final lousy chapters.

This is an Aid-in-Dying request.

It can be complicated,
quite a few regulatory hoops.

510
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:09,338
I'll get you through them.
