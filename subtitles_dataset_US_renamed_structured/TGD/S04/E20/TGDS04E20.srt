1
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:08,508
How are you feeling?

2
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:12,839
I want you to feel better.

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,310
So if going home might
make you feel better...

4
00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:20,448
it's a good thing.

5
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:36,059
So like, "Come on."
How would you say that?

6
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:42,868
Is that right?

7
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:44,544
Okay.

8
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:01,361
- What?
- You're smiling.

9
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:10,800
Oh, my God.

10
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:11,904
Oh.

11
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:13,734
Yes.

12
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:15,673
I approve, highly.

13
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:19,880
<i>Bienvenidos</i> to day one.

14
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:22,917
We are getting our feet wet
with the three easiest surgeries.

15
00:01:22,983 --> 00:01:27,785
<i>In OR 1, Dr. Rendon and
I have Le√≥n Castillo, 23...</i>

16
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:30,822
Antibiotic flush.

17
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:41,698
The incision is open. Nurse
Morales, I need a Kelly clamp.

18
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:43,771
Here you go, Dr. Murphy.

19
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:48,802
Okay, Dr. Murphy, I'll
guide you to the lesion.

20
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:21,037
No, no, no. Everyone
needs to work on that ASAP.

21
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,305
I'm so sorry. We get blackouts
in the mountains all the time.

22
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:26,142
- That's why we have a generator...
- Great.

23
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:28,512
- Which failed.
- You got a guess when it comes back?

24
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:29,675
Sorry, no.

25
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,082
Minutes? Hours?

26
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:34,177
We wait, we risk losing the
day, dropping three patients.

27
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:36,655
If I move my patient by the
window, I can debride the ulcer.

28
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:40,251
Go. Pray it stays clear out. I'll see
what I can do about a herniated bowel.

29
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,158
Can you resect a tumor
without ultrasound?

30
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:45,859
I will speak to Dr. Andrews
about a revised surgical plan.

31
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:47,332
Okay. Go.

32
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:49,641
Thank you very much. Good luck.

33
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,737
Suction's out. Same
for the electrocautery.

34
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:01,511
- Wanna use your fingers?
- It would minimize blood loss.

35
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:07,880
We could remove the
lower lobe without ultrasound.

36
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:10,287
Maybe we should close
her up and do this tomorrow.

37
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,390
It would be fatal.

38
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:16,725
Not to her. To a patient down
the list that we'll have to drop.

39
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:21,524
Maybe you're right. We
take the whole lower lobe.

40
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,649
No, I was not right.

41
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:43,383
I can locate the tumor
without ultrasound.

42
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,130
Her oxygen is very low.

43
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:55,129
Oxygen. Low.

44
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,466
Her oxygen is low.

45
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:00,263
I'm so sorry.

46
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:06,072
Where is Oscar?

47
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:07,614
He had to go home.

48
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:13,084
His mother is old and very sick.

49
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:16,452
He went home.

50
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:17,990
Yes.

51
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:23,962
Stay. Please.

52
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:37,505
I can feel pulsations
of an underlying vessel.

53
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:38,943
Must be the artery.

54
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:41,379
Feel your way under and make
the dissection plane deeper.

55
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:46,148
I can feel the bowel.

56
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:49,683
Sac is free.

57
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,829
- You're getting close to a fissure.
- I am.

58
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:58,388
The tissue is
becoming less pliable.

59
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,899
A laceration there
would be devastating.

60
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:04,597
We could wait a few more
minutes to see if the lights come on.

61
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,537
I don't think we should.

62
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:11,868
I feel something gravel-like
at the tip of my pickups.

63
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,209
I think that's the
surface of the tumor.

64
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:17,183
I'm there.

65
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:19,312
Nice work, Murphy.

66
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:20,877
We have a clean
path to the tumor.

67
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:21,987
Let's get it out.

68
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,055
I guess we could have waited.

69
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,569
How do you speak
English so well?

70
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:11,928
I'm American.

71
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:17,268
Born in Mexico, but my
mom is an L.A. Chicana.

72
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:19,942
I went to high school
in Santa Monica.

73
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:23,073
I just fake the accent
for sexiness purposes.

74
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:31,217
So when's the last
time you were back?

75
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:38,760
Are we getting to know each
other? I thought this was just a fling.

76
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:42,291
Mm. So we can chat about
what schools you went to

77
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:46,772
and where you worked in Africa,
but old vacations are a bridge too far?

78
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,239
Ten years. Happy?

79
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,106
Quite, in fact.

80
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:56,248
I have to go for a run.

81
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,351
- Now?
- You're clearly not a runner.

82
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,921
I promise to be <i>muy
rapido,</i> like a poof,

83
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:04,924
and it's gone, a fleeting
but joyous memory.

84
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:07,654
Oh, I can feel that
accent-generated sexiness

85
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,229
just vanishing by the second.

86
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:11,959
<i>Rapido,</i> but perfectly paced.

87
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,098
I'm gonna hold
you to both of those.

88
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:19,128
Well, the truth is, I
will not be <i>muy rapido.</i>

89
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:30,113
COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER

90
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,981
Will it hurt a lot?

91
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,612
He wants to know if it'll hurt.

92
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:36,384
Oh, no, no, no.

93
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:38,117
We'll be giving you some meds

94
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:41,384
and you'll have very little
pain after the operation.

95
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:53,203
And before the operation,

96
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,707
we will give you something
that will help you sleep

97
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,074
and when you wake up,
your Mom will be here.

98
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,880
Yes.

99
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:06,263
He didn't realize he was gonna
be asleep during the surgery.

100
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:14,724
Nurse Morales. How would one say,
"You, in addition to being very efficient,

101
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,662
turn out to be very
perceptive as well."

102
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:32,443
I feel like you may have
added a few adjectives.

103
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:37,579
Well, the truth is, I'm
not always so perceptive.

104
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:39,814
For example...

105
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:44,387
I was almost sure
you were <i>coqueteando.</i>

106
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:46,719
Flirting with me.

107
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,560
But if you were,

108
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:51,558
I'm sure you would have
taken off your wedding ring.

109
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:16,951
- You know, it's okay to be nervous.
- I'm not.

110
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,061
You should be proud.

111
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:25,462
You did a remarkable thing,
convincing her to come here.

112
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,729
You probably saved her life.

113
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,370
I'm just gonna sit
here for a little while

114
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:36,569
in case there's something
that you wanna tell me.

115
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:45,412
Because of me,
my mother will live.

116
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,416
But someone else...

117
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:55,154
I prayed that she
would get the operation.

118
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,455
But she only did
because Miguel...

119
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:01,433
the guy with the dog...

120
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,428
Because he got sick.

121
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,042
You know, you're a good person.

122
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:16,213
And sometimes that's hard
because you feel things that you...

123
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:17,978
You don't deserve to feel.

124
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,818
But sometimes...

125
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:24,354
being good is fun.

126
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:29,728
Come on.

127
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,435
I've freed the tumor from
the paranasal sinuses.

128
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:41,835
Periosteal dissector.

129
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:50,181
It's invading the orbital floor.

130
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,684
Curved osteotome.

131
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:57,721
And the ethmoid
and sphenoid too.

132
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,986
We're gonna have to
remove multiple bones.

133
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,691
Does the hospital have
titanium mini-plates and mesh?

134
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,197
Nothing that would work here.

135
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,260
Could we just cover
the hard palate?

136
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:10,394
No. We'd give him a
few years of constant pain

137
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,972
and he'd still wind up
with a fistula that kills him.

138
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:16,498
Is there a private hospital,
specialist, something?

139
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,839
I have a friend
from nursing school.

140
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:24,078
She works for a dental surgeon who
fixes all the rich people in this area.

141
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,777
I can be there and
back in an hour.

142
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,684
Keep him stable. Okay?

143
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:29,755
Thank you!

144
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,792
I was not fair before
when I was teasing.

145
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:36,729
You were very
fair, I was flirting.

146
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,195
And how would your wife feel?

147
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:42,732
Well, she'd be fine with it.

148
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:47,607
I have heard men
say that to me before.

149
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:53,075
Well, she told me a few days
ago that she's moving out.

150
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:54,146
And, uh...

151
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:59,880
Well, she's seeing someone.

152
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:04,552
So I'm down here
clearing my head,

153
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:07,150
deciding if I wanna try to
make the marriage work.

154
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:10,620
By flirting?

155
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:16,727
I guess I just wanted to
feel wanted. To feel good.

156
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:22,608
It was selfish. I'm sorry it
made you feel uncomfortable.

157
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:25,544
It didn't.

158
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:36,352
And I think you do wanna
make your marriage work.

159
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:40,458
That's why you
still wear your ring.

160
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:30,019
- The deal was 20,000.
- You said 4,000.

161
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:31,477
- I said 20,000.
- No.

162
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:33,342
It was 4,000. We had that deal.

163
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:35,843
The life of a boy
hangs on the line.

164
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:38,976
I'm sorry. I think there
was a misunderstanding.

165
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,518
He's telling us it costs
us 20,000 quetzales now.

166
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:49,857
- Do we have that?
- No.

167
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:51,261
- I can go to an ATM.
- No, no.

168
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:54,357
There's no automatic
cashier machine I can use.

169
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,560
This is my fault.

170
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,870
No. I shouldn't have come.

171
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:06,574
He sees an American doctor
and knows he can ask for more.

172
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,547
There's a hospital in
Quetzaltenango a few hours from here.

173
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,584
- Offer him this too.
- No.

174
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,925
No, no, no. You
don't have to do this.

175
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,727
Ana, it's just a ring.

176
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,881
Her oxygen level is very low.

177
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:42,948
Oh, my God.

178
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:46,578
The doctor will give her steroids in
order to help prevent lung inflammation.

179
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:47,984
We need a ventilator.

180
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:50,454
Ventilator. She has
to go on a ventilator?

181
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:03,399
<i>- Hello.</i>
- Hey, Shaun. How you doing?

182
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,404
<i>I just finished my second
surgery and it went well,</i>

183
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:08,998
<i>and I am not doing well at all.</i>

184
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:10,976
Okay.

185
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:13,136
Lea is sad.

186
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:17,242
And I don't know how
to make her less sad.

187
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:19,151
Do you?

188
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:25,485
<i>Well, I don't know if I'm the right
person to talk about this right now.</i>

189
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:27,653
Why not?

190
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:33,633
<i>I just don't think
that right now...</i>

191
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:38,369
<i>I've always loved that
you've asked me for advice.</i>

192
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:39,996
<i>And I always will.</i>

193
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:48,238
But I've noticed the last while,

194
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,347
you've needed me less and less.

195
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:54,785
I don't know if you've
noticed, but it got me to thinking

196
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:58,757
about what Steve told you,
that you're the smart one.

197
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,790
You... You can do anything.

198
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:09,160
You're good at this.

199
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:10,702
Better than...

200
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,205
Better than you think.

201
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:24,916
Ready?

202
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,484
Does it look good?

203
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:40,098
Beautiful.

204
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:10,228
How did you end up in Guatemala?

205
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:13,457
<i>√ìrale,</i> you're just not
good at flings, are you?

206
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:16,365
You should be asking me
if I've read the <i>Kama Sutra.</i>

207
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,563
My favorite whipped cream.

208
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:23,068
It's a good job.

209
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:27,775
I get to coordinate these
missions, help some people.

210
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:29,838
So you're the workaholic,

211
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:34,616
dedicate-your-life-to-the-downtrodden
hero type? Is that what drives you?

212
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,918
I also get to sometimes have
sex with American doctors.

213
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,451
You're only here for a week.

214
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,724
We don't need to bare
our souls to each other.

215
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:49,801
On the other hand, I'm only
here for a week, so why not?

216
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:55,741
You first. What are you hiding?

217
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,809
I'm not hiding anything.

218
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:02,939
Okay. I prefer a fresh local product,
but if you have lactose issues...

219
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,381
Wait. What did you ask me that?

220
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,386
Seriously. Why are we
having this conversation?

221
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:10,514
You think I'm being dishonest.
What do you think I'm hiding?

222
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:13,024
I don't know.

223
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:16,590
But between your
excessive need to exercise,

224
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,032
the alarms going off that you never
answer when you're around me,

225
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,601
and the nightmares that
you have every night...

226
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:24,836
You're hiding something.

227
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,607
Let's get ready for the day.

228
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:43,119
You ready to start?

229
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,118
Almost.

230
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:52,020
There's three kinds of foreign
doctors who come down here.

231
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:55,329
The first, they care too much.

232
00:18:56,135 --> 00:19:00,630
All the people they can't
save, it overwhelms them.

233
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:04,473
The second care too little,
and that has problems of its own.

234
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:10,040
And the third group, they find
a way to distance themselves

235
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,981
so they can do their job.

236
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:14,217
I better be in that group.

237
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:16,982
You're in your own group.

238
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,584
You care so deeply.

239
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:25,359
But that only gives
you more strength.

240
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:29,901
Thank you.

241
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:32,971
Well, let's go.

242
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:40,843
Entering the peritoneal cavity.

243
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:42,609
I need a long retractor.

244
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,517
That's not just gallstones.

245
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,695
There is an immobile,
irregularly shaped mass.

246
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,989
She's got gallbladder cancer. It's
spread to the surface of the liver.

247
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,372
It will double the
duration of the surgery.

248
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:11,377
Triple. You're looking
at 12 hours at least.

249
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:14,141
- We'll need to swap with one of you.
- That's not possible.

250
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:15,373
Neither of us are prepped.

251
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:18,077
It would be endangering
two patients instead of one.

252
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,584
We can't just close her up.

253
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:21,120
Unfortunately, we can.

254
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:26,151
I'm sorry, but you've
never led anything like this.

255
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:31,958
I think we should
let her keep going.

256
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,295
- What's the worst that could happen?
- Beyond death?

257
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,962
This patient was gonna die anyway.
Claire gives her a fighting chance.

258
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:46,111
Okay.

259
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:52,274
What happened...

260
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:55,984
with the ventilator?

261
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:59,650
They took it. They
needed it for the surgery.

262
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:03,785
The doctors needed it.

263
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:05,832
The doctors needed it?

264
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,667
And where's the nurse?

265
00:21:09,502 --> 00:21:10,993
The nurse?

266
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:14,096
Busy, lots of work.

267
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:16,141
Okay.

268
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:18,868
I'll stay.

269
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:21,948
Stay <i>aqu√≠.</i> No matter
how long it takes.

270
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:30,317
- Is there a problem?
- Yes, the patient came back.

271
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:41,357
Le√≥n, the guy
with ventral hernia,

272
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:44,699
checked himself out last night
and went to work. In construction.

273
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,636
He reherniated? How bad?

274
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:49,675
About an inch of bowel is
incarcerated, probably ischemic.

275
00:21:49,742 --> 00:21:52,211
He'll be dead in days
unless we operate on him.

276
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,712
Can you fit him in after
your skull reconstruction?

277
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:57,909
Not without big risks to both of
them. What about the other surgeons?

278
00:21:58,017 --> 00:22:00,043
You think I'd be here if
anyone else was free?

279
00:22:02,388 --> 00:22:03,515
Give him some morphine.

280
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,514
Until when?

281
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:08,684
It sucks, but it's his fault.
We told him he needed to rest.

282
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:11,731
This isn't some tech bro in San
Francisco waltzing out to party.

283
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:14,699
He needed to keep his job
and not watch his family starve.

284
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:18,329
If we operate on him, we
don't operate on someone else.

285
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:23,537
I'll operate on Le√≥n.

286
00:22:24,877 --> 00:22:27,437
I've been doing PT the last
year. It's been going great.

287
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:29,447
You really think you
can handle the surgery?

288
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:31,583
I know I can.

289
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:34,646
I think I can do it
without any pain.

290
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,224
We need to do a
cross-clamp resection.

291
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:46,788
Have you ever done one?

292
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:48,891
I've seen one when
I was an intern.

293
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:57,800
Freeing up the vein.

294
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:05,614
Dividing the pedicles.

295
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:10,480
Uh...

296
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:13,415
Transecting the segments.

297
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:30,742
Step two.

298
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,108
That doesn't look ideal.

299
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:41,153
It's a midline ventral defect.

300
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:44,485
Also, the tissue
planes are friable.

301
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,786
We're gonna need
component separation.

302
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,619
We cut the posterior
rectus sheath,

303
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:54,757
mobilizing soft tissue off of
the external oblique fascia...

304
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,497
and then incise it.

305
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:05,839
Common femoral artery's
almost completely occluded.

306
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:08,141
I'll prep the inflow
anastomosis site.

307
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,810
I have PTSD.

308
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:18,948
I have nightmares because of it.

309
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:21,152
I exercise to help me
manage my symptoms.

310
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,695
And the alarm on my
phone is to remind me

311
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:27,699
to take my daily cocktail of
fluoxetine, prazosin and quetiapine.

312
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:31,398
Can you tunnel the bypass
graft in the subcutaneous plane?

313
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,136
I'll get a clamp through.

314
00:24:36,075 --> 00:24:39,705
I lost a good friend a year ago

315
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,141
and then lost more to COVID...

316
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:47,213
and then spent a lot of
time denying I had an issue.

317
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:51,222
Running from pain.

318
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:58,496
In the future, I'm hoping to
do more running toward things

319
00:24:58,564 --> 00:24:59,793
than away from them.

320
00:25:04,403 --> 00:25:05,837
I'm ready for the graft.

321
00:25:26,392 --> 00:25:27,690
Oh, it's my turn.

322
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,389
You're exhausted.
You should lie down.

323
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:32,055
No. No.

324
00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:33,429
Ten minutes.

325
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:37,467
I'm good.

326
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:39,197
I'll rest next.

327
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,410
Ten minutes.

328
00:25:47,246 --> 00:25:48,246
Thank you.

329
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:05,898
- If you need a break...
- I'm fine.

330
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:08,456
Just cramped a little.

331
00:26:11,437 --> 00:26:12,437
I'm done.

332
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:18,407
I can take over.

333
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:36,127
This ventral wall
defect is huge.

334
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:38,963
Yeah.

335
00:26:46,405 --> 00:26:47,771
Two Kocher clamps.

336
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:31,848
- Heart rate is spiking.
- BP's dropping. She's crashing.

337
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,441
Why? What happened?

338
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:36,387
I don't know.

339
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:44,830
Edna's bleeding out. At this
rate, she has minutes to live.

340
00:27:44,897 --> 00:27:47,230
There was post-op blood
around the liver, nothing crazy.

341
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:50,393
The surgical drain also has
blood, no evidence of bile leak.

342
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:54,997
Okay, so the patient could have
GI bleed unrelated to surgery,

343
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:57,372
or a leak into the liver
from the hepatectomy.

344
00:27:57,476 --> 00:27:58,739
Yes. Which one?

345
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:02,747
Mm. What's the surgical drain
output over the last half hour?

346
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:05,943
- If it's over 200 cc, the ans...
- It's 200 cc exactly.

347
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:10,012
- Oh.
- Yeah. I think it's the stomach.

348
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:13,058
The clotted blood in the NG
tube could be holding back a flood.

349
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:16,220
An intrahepatic bleed
is statistically more likely.

350
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,996
I still think it's the stomach.

351
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,526
But I came to you for
a reason, okay, thanks.

352
00:28:23,602 --> 00:28:24,602
Claire.

353
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:29,265
Neither of us
knows for sure, but...

354
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,101
you are good at this.

355
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:36,547
Better than you think.

356
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:47,224
BP's almost bottomed
out. What do we do?

357
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,394
Stomach.

358
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:01,837
You did good work.

359
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,569
I just had to close
and clean up.

360
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,475
The patient's in
recovery, doing well.

361
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,915
I need a friend.

362
00:29:24,663 --> 00:29:28,566
I hadn't really given
up on being a surgeon.

363
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:31,567
PT was going great.

364
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:34,997
Almost no pain at all until...

365
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:39,144
It's all dumb, because...

366
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,304
I like being an
internist. I just...

367
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:46,851
hate...

368
00:29:49,855 --> 00:29:51,016
failing.

369
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:59,454
Seriously? This is funny?

370
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:02,199
A little.

371
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,130
Never seen you vulnerable.

372
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:10,601
Your face gets kind of ugly.

373
00:30:12,678 --> 00:30:13,678
Shut up.

374
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,614
You didn't fail.

375
00:30:19,618 --> 00:30:20,847
You never fail.

376
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:26,147
For three years, I've
watched you kick ass.

377
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:28,486
At everything.

378
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:31,725
You inspire me.

379
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:33,992
And annoy me.

380
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:38,334
Small price to pay.

381
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:52,415
Your mom's gonna be all better.

382
00:31:03,095 --> 00:31:08,033
The lungs sound fine
without any retractions.

383
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,969
There's only one way to tell
if the steroids worked well.

384
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,271
Stop bagging.

385
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:19,307
Hopefully, she can
breathe on her own now.

386
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:45,195
Bye.

387
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:48,502
No, no.

388
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:54,240
We need to sleep.

389
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:55,940
She is still not finished.

390
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:59,718
She has to say goodbye.

391
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,988
She said goodbye.

392
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:06,616
It's one of three phrases
she knows in Spanish.

393
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:11,961
I want her to hold my baby.

394
00:32:17,836 --> 00:32:20,032
She wants you to hold her baby.

395
00:32:43,195 --> 00:32:44,857
Oh.

396
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:45,963
Oh.

397
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:55,330
She's so beautiful.

398
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:12,389
Bastion.

399
00:33:16,795 --> 00:33:18,320
- For me?
- Yes.

400
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:32,606
Thank you.

401
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,386
I'm sorry I've been weird.

402
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:23,227
For a year.

403
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:27,225
I really do care about you.

404
00:34:27,866 --> 00:34:29,562
I wish you and Heather the best.

405
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:34,069
Well, it's a bit late for that.

406
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:35,973
I broke up with Heather.

407
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:39,736
- When?
- Last night.

408
00:34:41,313 --> 00:34:42,747
- No.
- Yeah.

409
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:50,319
Because you think you love me?

410
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:53,991
I do.

411
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:01,493
I think I love you too.

412
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:15,803
I committed a crime.

413
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:21,850
My first year of residency, I...

414
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,616
I was arrested
for pot possession.

415
00:35:25,657 --> 00:35:29,458
The cops were jerks, I
argued with them, and...

416
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:32,720
it got physical.

417
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,065
When my court date
came around, I skipped.

418
00:35:38,837 --> 00:35:41,966
And now there's an active
warrant out for me in the States.

419
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:44,940
That's why I haven't been back.

420
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:51,380
But what if I got a lawyer,
got this cleared up?

421
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:56,051
What if I was to start
running toward things?

422
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:02,184
Would you be interested
in a visitor in San Jose?

423
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:12,662
There's something
I want to ask you.

424
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:36,521
I think you should take the job.

425
00:36:37,629 --> 00:36:40,497
Of course she wasn't gonna
poach you without asking me.

426
00:36:45,637 --> 00:36:47,606
I can't speak the language.

427
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:49,732
I don't know anyone here.

428
00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:52,710
I just started a
relationship with my father.

429
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:56,910
I'm not ready.

430
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,208
All legit concerns.

431
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:03,454
But what I didn't hear
was one single reason

432
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,080
you don't want to do this.

433
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:10,293
You've spent so many years
thinking your heart was a liability.

434
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:12,523
It made you care too much.

435
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:14,259
It hurt too much.

436
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,799
But maybe here...

437
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:24,901
maybe here, caring too
much is exactly what's needed.

438
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:51,368
Okay.

439
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:55,800
Aw.

440
00:38:05,984 --> 00:38:07,577
This is about time.

441
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:16,793
You were far too
good for us, anyway.

442
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:18,495
Aw.

443
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:25,401
Proud of you, Dr. Browne.

444
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:32,040
- Oh.
- Love you.

445
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:43,013
I'm never quite sure
what you're thinking.

446
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:45,920
Many things.

447
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:49,755
That I'm sad.

448
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,732
That this airport is the only one
I've been to without a Cinnabon.

449
00:38:57,569 --> 00:38:59,765
That people need
to move forward.

450
00:39:02,941 --> 00:39:03,941
That...

451
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:07,939
I hope you're moving forward.

452
00:39:11,216 --> 00:39:12,844
I think I am, Shaun.

453
00:39:16,888 --> 00:39:17,947
What do we do now?

454
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:19,056
I don't know.

455
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:24,586
I've never hugged you, Claire.

456
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:15,304
I'm not going to Hershey.

457
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,517
Are you done being sad?

458
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:22,786
No.

459
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:29,927
But... right now, I know
I won't be sad forever.

460
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:32,793
And I don't think I would
have gotten there without you.

461
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:42,602
I want to spend the
rest of my life with you.

462
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:48,307
I want to spend my
life with you too, Lea.

463
00:40:56,988 --> 00:40:58,479
Will you marry me?

464
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:02,292
Of course. I love you.

465
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,762
I love you too.

466
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:18,308
- We are getting married.
- Yeah.

467
00:41:19,177 --> 00:41:20,873
We are getting married!

468
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,978
We are getting married!

469
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:26,216
Oh, yeah!

470
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,810
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

471
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,178
Okay.

472
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:32,780
Oh, yeah.

473
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:36,517
Okay. I have to tell Claire.

474
00:41:40,031 --> 00:41:41,031
Okay.

475
00:41:49,374 --> 00:41:51,741
Yes. I'm ready.

476
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,182
Scalpel.

477
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:02,447
Yes, doctor.

478
00:42:06,324 --> 00:42:07,587
Welcome.

479
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:11,557
Come on.
