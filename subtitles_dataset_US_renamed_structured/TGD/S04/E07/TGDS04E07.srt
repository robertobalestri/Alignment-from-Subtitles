1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,537
Oh!

2
00:00:18,986 --> 00:00:22,047
We can't both shower
at the same time, Lea.

3
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:24,522
One of us would block the
stream of water for the other.

4
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:27,288
Oh, Shaun, this is not for
the purpose of cleanliness.

5
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,887
This is for the purpose
of having sex with you.

6
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:32,598
Oh.

7
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:37,666
No. No, it would be
inconvenient, possibly dangerous.

8
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:39,730
Soap might get
into difficult places.

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,570
If we leaned against
the shower handle,

10
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:44,406
we could scald ourselves,
bottles could be disarranged.

11
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:46,813
It was just a thought.

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,940
It was a bad thought.

13
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,518
I'm surprised, you're
such an intelligent person.

14
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:55,916
I'll reset your alarm.

15
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:01,961
It's a three-day
weekend and a full moon.

16
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,587
People are gonna
do stupid things,

17
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:06,565
so I'm asking everyone to take
an extra trauma call in the E.R.

18
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:09,364
Make yourselves available
if you're needed. Questions?

19
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:14,233
- How'd you get the bruise?
- First casualty of the full moon.

20
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:16,867
I smacked my head when I
was reaching for my coffee mug.

21
00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:17,968
Any other questions?

22
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,570
Why is there a Subaru
in your parking space?

23
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:22,611
Because it's my car.

24
00:01:22,716 --> 00:01:23,716
You have a car?

25
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,870
You're gonna be seeing
a lot of it. I sold the Ducati.

26
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:26,943
What? No.

27
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:29,489
- It just wasn't practical.
- Is it already gone? Because...

28
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,582
A guy from Craigslist
snatched it up.

29
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:34,787
Any other questions,
not dealing with the bike?

30
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:39,230
It wasn't that
much of a bruise, -

31
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,634
but the doctor at the ski resort
told us I might develop a hematoma.

32
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:46,070
It's not unusual, but
it'll need to be drained.

33
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,975
I see you were treated
for melanoma six years ago

34
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:51,773
and more recently,
breast cancer.

35
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:56,873
Hence, this ski trip. A
celebration. One year cancer-free.

36
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,317
Also, five years cancer-free.

37
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:03,815
I don't suppose a long
needle will be involved in this?

38
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:07,928
Your hematoma extends pretty
deep, so the needle will have to be long.

39
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:09,156
But it's over quickly.

40
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:11,631
I have to intervene
before this deal goes south.

41
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:13,257
You don't mind if I step out?

42
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:17,897
Would you like us to wait for
your husband to come back?

43
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,964
No. Let's go ahead.

44
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:26,510
<i>How do you get
frostbite in San Jose?</i>

45
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,172
Cryotherapy accident.

46
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:29,848
I stayed in the
booth a little too long.

47
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,996
I was gonna stand outside
for the full three minutes,

48
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:33,611
- but he said...
- I said no need.

49
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:35,656
I'd set the stopwatch
on my phone,

50
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:38,521
after which my thoughts
immediately drifted and...

51
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:40,823
I came back to find
him frozen in carbonite.

52
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:43,487
You know, I'm more
worried about the fever.

53
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:45,323
Was the cryotherapy
meant to treat something?

54
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:46,458
No, routine self-care.

55
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:48,729
We've made life extension
part of our health regime.

56
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,703
Supplements,
meditation, exercise.

57
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:53,501
Three of my gaming
apps have gone viral.

58
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:56,509
I'm lucky enough to afford
basically whatever I want,

59
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,545
so I spend it on my health.

60
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:01,241
Now, I figure fever
must be an infection.

61
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:05,814
Mm. I know that frostbite can
make you vulnerable. It just...

62
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:08,879
It didn't seem
severe enough to...

63
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:12,019
I'm sorry, I feel
a little queasy.

64
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:14,256
Wyatt.

65
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:26,001
I need a medical
transport team, STAT.

66
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:28,065
Perforated bowel, he
needs immediate surgery.

67
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,414
No. No! Why do
people hate wind farms?

68
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,011
Everyone thinks they're noisy.

69
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,286
This could make a
turbine sound as quiet

70
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,631
as a page turning in a library.

71
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:48,685
That's not worth our investing
in? Did you even look... Hold on.

72
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:50,390
Anything I need to know?

73
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:51,557
Hematoma's drained.

74
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:53,600
We sent the sample
to Pathology, routine.

75
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,192
- Should have it back sometime tomorrow.
- Thank you.

76
00:03:57,304 --> 00:04:01,105
I couldn't help overhearing a
little. Are you a venture capitalist?

77
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,909
The only people who
ask me if I'm a VC

78
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:07,139
are people who want a
VC to invest in their project.

79
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:13,376
Maybe after we get your wife
healthy again, we could talk.

80
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:16,013
Call whenever you're ready,
my life is listening to ideas.

81
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,668
If it's good, I'll run it by my
two partners. If it's really good,

82
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:21,059
we'll take a 30 percent equity
position in your company.

83
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:25,524
Yeah, yeah. You're the one

84
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,534
who wanted to get us
into clean technology.

85
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,538
I think I've been
asked out on a date.

86
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,140
Nice.

87
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:35,300
No, I work with him.

88
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,310
- Hasn't stopped you before.
- I supervise him.

89
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,743
- Schedules can be changed.
- He's polyamorous.

90
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:43,145
Unless he also texted
you a ring, it's just a date.

91
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,684
And you need to get out more.

92
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:47,312
So do I.

93
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,680
You wanna take down
the splenocolic ligament,

94
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:59,299
just don't nick the
inferior mesenteric artery.

95
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:03,098
I feel the IMA under my finger.

96
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:06,572
Placing the stapler and cutting.

97
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:09,074
I voted approve.

98
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,508
Disapprove.

99
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,080
No opinion.

100
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:16,877
There's a poll?

101
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,508
Yes. About shower sex.

102
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,815
I know it's wrong to
discuss shower sex at work,

103
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:23,356
so I did a poll instead.

104
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:24,721
Much better.

105
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:28,353
Dr. Murphy, do you really want people
knowing the details of your personal life?

106
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,890
You don't think they took
it as an abstract question?

107
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,994
No, we all take it as something
that happened between you and Lea.

108
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,468
And that there was a fight.

109
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:39,870
Sometime before 8 a.m. today,
which was when the poll was sent out.

110
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:43,036
You are very astute.

111
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:46,341
I'm seeing diffuse dilatation
of the large bowel here.

112
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:47,413
Is that normal?

113
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:53,517
Some calcified
lesions. Wall's thin too.

114
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,713
Hirschsprung's?

115
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:57,848
I thought Hirschsprung's was a disease
only babies and young children got.

116
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:00,985
It is, but he has it.

117
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:11,737
We treated the Hirschsprung's

118
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:14,273
by removing the
dilated part of your colon.

119
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,742
It won't impact your life, but
we would like an explanation.

120
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:20,371
Dr. Murphy doesn't mean we
expect you to be a diagnostician.

121
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:23,212
It's just... this was
kind of singular,

122
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:25,946
so if you have any thoughts...

123
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:29,420
Did anyone in your family
suddenly develop these symptoms?

124
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:36,455
I did something singular to
myself about six months ago.

125
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,022
I modified my genetic code.

126
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:41,435
I did a CRISPR procedure
under the guidance

127
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,574
of some researchers I know
in China through my work.

128
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,572
They put together a series of
cocktails, they FedEx'd them to me,

129
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:50,906
and Sophie helped me inject
them into my bone marrow.

130
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,811
Why? If you know
anything about CRISPR,

131
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:56,247
you know how risky it is
to tinker with your genome.

132
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:58,945
You have no idea what
problems you might let loose.

133
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:01,113
I needed to optimize
my telomerase activity.

134
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:03,827
It's the enzyme responsible for
correcting cell replication errors.

135
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,415
Essentially, the cause of aging.

136
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:08,587
You can't stop aging through
changing your telomerase activity.

137
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:13,690
You might extend your life a little,
but exercise, it does the same thing.

138
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,464
Much less risky. Your
decision makes no sense.

139
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:20,062
Extending my life by a few
years is only my short-term goal.

140
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,938
Look, you know how
fast medicine is moving.

141
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,842
The day isn't that far away
when cloning will make transplants

142
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,141
as easy as switching
out a light socket.

143
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:30,649
AI will start to make breakthroughs
that we can't predict or understand.

144
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,345
Medical knowledge
will rise exponentially.

145
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,979
There are babies born
now who could live to see it,

146
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:37,786
could live to be a
thousand years old.

147
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:42,025
Maybe more, maybe forever.
Or at least as long as they want to.

148
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,761
So our plan is to give
my CRISPR a year

149
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:48,962
to make sure the telomerase
change works, and then we'll do her.

150
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:53,232
We'll aspirate a sample
of your bone marrow.

151
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,537
See if we can figure
out what the hell you did.

152
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:07,287
Hey. Um, I don't think
coffee is a good idea.

153
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:10,018
Entire civilizations rely on it,

154
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:12,368
but I don't think you're
referring to the beverage itself.

155
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:15,471
No, I don't think it's a good idea for
first years and fourth years to go out.

156
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,397
I am bound to supervise
you at some point in the future

157
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:22,401
and it'd get complicated
trying to change dates out and...

158
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:27,403
The fact is, seeing somebody
you work with rarely ends happily,

159
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,271
so I appreciate you
thinking of me, but I...

160
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,901
Oh, you... thought
it was a date.

161
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,714
I'm still new here, and I
thought it was a good opportunity

162
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:36,976
to get to know each other.

163
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,977
Well, coffee's perfect
because you're asking

164
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:42,386
the least amount of commitment
from another human being.

165
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:44,015
It's not even lunch.

166
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,517
If it's still a no,
it's still a no.

167
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:48,721
But I'll let you
re-think your answer?

168
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,525
What?

169
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:05,712
He only claimed it
wasn't a date to save face.

170
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:09,374
Or maybe I just assumed.
But why did I assume?

171
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:11,543
I don't think I'm
some kind of narcissist

172
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:14,554
who thinks every man
wants to get close to me. I...

173
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:17,557
Or we both assumed it's
a date because it's a date.

174
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:20,355
This is fun. I like
being your bestie.

175
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:21,725
Slumber party?

176
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:30,598
I made a poll to test the
popularity of shower sex.

177
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:33,901
I heard. I fielded some
questions about that.

178
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:38,274
Approve has won, but
don't get too excited, Lea.

179
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:41,542
It's only 58-38 with several

180
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,947
- complicated non-committals...
- Okay.

181
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,780
So clearly my
attitude is reasonable.

182
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:50,084
We don't have room
for a skier exercise thing.

183
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:53,126
I'm only putting it together
so I can take a picture

184
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:54,285
and sell it online.

185
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:56,727
Why do you have it
if you don't want it?

186
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,764
My ex sent it.

187
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,439
Ex?

188
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:09,507
Husband.

189
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:14,373
I left this thing in the attic
until I got settled somewhere

190
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,506
with enough space,

191
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,608
and, okay, that was ten years
ago, but it's not like it was in his way.

192
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:26,688
We got married. Not for
long, right out of high school.

193
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,695
Literally the boy next
door. We grew up together,

194
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:33,425
people expected it.
It was a big mistake.

195
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,992
We both realized
it pretty quickly.

196
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:42,769
Why would you even
wanna live forever?

197
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,611
You'd be bored out of your mind.

198
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:50,139
The person I am now is miles
away from the person I was at 14.

199
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:53,211
I only get more
distant every year.

200
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,920
You learn to understand...

201
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,560
love books that you once hated.

202
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:05,156
Sometimes people you once hated.

203
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:09,860
Music that you didn't get
the point of becomes magical.

204
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:14,234
A thousand new doors will open.
I look forward to the adventure.

205
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,715
Sorry.

206
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,972
Adventure's not
always gonna be fun.

207
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:24,209
I figure it takes 40 or 50 years

208
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:26,650
just to get over the
things your parents did.

209
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,312
If only we lived long enough,

210
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:31,950
the human race might finally
have a chance to grow up.

211
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,731
What size shoes do you wear?

212
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,460
Seven and a half.

213
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,864
Dr. Allen's Walking
on Clouds inserts.

214
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:48,532
Putting "doctor" in names is
always a good marketing strategy.

215
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:51,077
They're designed to
reduce inflammation

216
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:53,112
that could lead
to plantar fasciitis,

217
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,876
calluses, arthritis, and
they feel damn good.

218
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:59,316
Does this have anything to do with
our patient's venture capitalist husband?

219
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:00,547
I need testimonials.

220
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,418
Labs and Path for Hannah Palmer.

221
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:08,184
Aren't we all busy enough
learning how to be surgeons?

222
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,986
Do you really wanna divide
your focus onto something trivial?

223
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:18,936
Because wanting to make
money taints the purity of medicine?

224
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:25,038
I have five brothers. I've been
taking care of people my whole life.

225
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:28,047
Someone got hurt, they
came to me to patch them up.

226
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:31,913
I became a doctor so
I could get paid for it.

227
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:35,079
But also because I'm good
at taking care of people.

228
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:37,385
It's possible to do something
for more than one reason.

229
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:50,569
The news is bad.

230
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:02,972
There's an abnormally
healthy population

231
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:05,813
of Hematopoietic
progenitor stem cells.

232
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:07,045
He did it?

233
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,144
It's significant.

234
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:11,658
He's succeeded in optimizing
enough telomerase activity

235
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:13,693
to potentially add ten
years to his natural life.

236
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,319
Well, assuming he
doesn't subtract about 50.

237
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:19,331
There's already an autoimmune
reaction that mimics Hirschsprung's.

238
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:20,593
Who knows what else he did?

239
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:23,330
What if this is the opposite
of an autoimmune condition?

240
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:26,081
What if he's done something that
lowers his resistance to infection?

241
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:28,597
Then we'd be seeing
more opportunistic infections

242
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:30,143
of the lungs and skin.

243
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:32,075
If you lived another 1000 years,

244
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:35,172
would you be with the same
person at the end as at the beginning?

245
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:36,681
No.

246
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:39,609
No, if you assume monogamy.

247
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:41,406
That puts too much
strain on a relationship.

248
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:43,616
Is one person supposed
to be everything to another

249
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,352
all the time for 1000 years?

250
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:47,018
Yeah, apparently Jesus agrees.

251
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:51,330
On monogamy. He said that in
heaven there'll be no more marriages.

252
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:54,697
I guess humans can't
sustain a relationship that long.

253
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:56,394
You read the New Testament too?

254
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,869
And the Qur'an,
and other things.

255
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:02,375
Like you're a stalker, like you and
God had an acrimonious divorce.

256
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:06,235
What if he caused
neurofibromatosis?

257
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,372
Microscopic tumors
forming on the nerve sheath?

258
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:10,747
Possible, but there'd
have been some evidence

259
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,512
of Schwann cell
growth around his colon.

260
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:15,144
Would you still love your
wife in a thousand years?

261
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:19,349
You have three answers,
that should be enough.

262
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:21,724
Park's marriage
failed in far less time

263
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:26,391
and Enrique doesn't even try,
Asher is a... unknown quantity.

264
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:29,436
You're committed.
You've made promises.

265
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:36,775
I've made promises based on an
understood human lifespan, Murphy.

266
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:40,909
Most likely diagnosis is
autoimmune polyneuropathy.

267
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:43,642
It damaged the enteric ganglion
nerve and led to the perforation.

268
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,083
Start him on steroids
and immunosuppressants.

269
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,347
Dr. Andrews?

270
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:52,017
So you wouldn't have gotten married
if you thought it would be forever.

271
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:54,754
You expect all
relationships to fail over time.

272
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:56,557
It's just a question
of how long.

273
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,656
I love her now.

274
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,730
I intend to love
her as long as I live.

275
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:09,466
But eventually,
everything breaks.

276
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,713
I always go back to comfort
reading when I'm in the hospital.

277
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:22,881
Cozy mysteries and
little English villages

278
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,117
where nothing bad
happens to anyone we like.

279
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,621
We've gotten your results back.

280
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:31,129
- When will your husband be...
- Is it cancer?

281
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:34,499
Yes.

282
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:38,269
Thyroid carcinoma.

283
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,408
We're gonna do a
complete imaging series

284
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:43,705
- to pinpoint just how advanced...
- Treatment?

285
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:47,940
Surgery to remove
some or all of your thyroid

286
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:50,210
is usually the first
line of defense.

287
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:53,310
Sometimes we can wait,
but given the hematoma

288
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:56,321
was probably caused by the
tumor invading nearby vasculatures,

289
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:59,418
we should probably do
it in the next few days.

290
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:03,027
Later, there'll be
radioactive iodine treatment.

291
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:05,363
Panic attack?

292
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,968
Her trachea is
deviated to the right.

293
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:15,508
The tumor's compressing
it. We're doing surgery now.

294
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,749
What happened? The nurse just
said surgery. Was it the hematoma?

295
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,657
It's more serious.

296
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:39,056
It... It's not cancer again?

297
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:44,062
Thyroid carcinoma.
We've removed her thyroid.

298
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,468
She's doing well.

299
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:49,031
We're looking into potential
causes. Genetic, environmental.

300
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:53,306
There may be a deeper issue
that we can find and address.

301
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:04,415
I can't do this.

302
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,491
You've done it before.
You'll do it this time.

303
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,802
You know what it's like?

304
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,168
To wake up every morning

305
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,106
and know your wife might
not be here next year?

306
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:29,011
All those
treatments, they all...

307
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:32,110
They all have this little
tag attached to them

308
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,517
that says, "because
she might die."

309
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:39,922
And you see them put those gloves
on before they hook up the chemo.

310
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:41,460
You know why they do that?

311
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,325
It's because it's poison.

312
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:48,366
And you sit there...

313
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:52,870
and you watch them shove
poison into the person you love.

314
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:58,473
And why? Because she might die.

315
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:04,043
We're killing her
because she might die.

316
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:11,790
Go for a run, go punch a wall.

317
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:14,489
You need to release
some endorphins.

318
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:17,462
My release is my job,
and that's why I love it.

319
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:22,091
My work requires total focus,
and every minute I'm working

320
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:26,162
is a minute I'm not
thinking about... losing her.

321
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,173
I have to go.

322
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:42,449
Your pain and weakness are
consistent with polyneuropathy,

323
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:45,286
treatable with steroids
and immunosuppressants.

324
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:48,327
If you live 1000 years,
will you still love Sophie?

325
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:52,158
Yes.

326
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:56,293
How can you be sure? People
change. You expect to change.

327
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,331
Sophie and I will
change together.

328
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:02,117
We'll go through the same
adventures and learn the same lessons.

329
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,770
What if you go through
the same adventures

330
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:06,278
and learn different lessons?

331
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:09,315
Even if we did, whoever,
whatever we become,

332
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:10,906
Sophie will always be beautiful.

333
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,976
I mean, she could turn into
a machine or a set of pixels

334
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:16,522
or a giant purple flower,
she'll still be beautiful

335
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:19,786
because it's part of
her essential nature.

336
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:25,491
But if you don't know
how you'll change,

337
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:27,829
- you don't know how you'll change.
- Shaun.

338
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:31,303
We'll let you get some rest.

339
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,305
The steroids should
make you feel a lot better.

340
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:43,476
Why didn't you ever mention
you had an ex-husband?

341
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:48,246
Shaun, I've barely
thought about him in years.

342
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:51,749
I didn't mention him
because he's not important.

343
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,991
I know, that's the problem.

344
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:57,953
At one time, you felt he
was important enough

345
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,967
to your life to marry him, and
now you barely think of him.

346
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:06,038
You make long-term plans,
you have expectations,

347
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:07,903
and then something
happens to you,

348
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:10,067
and suddenly you're
a different person.

349
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:16,105
I know you don't like
change, but it's not all bad.

350
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:21,080
After all, you are working to
change yourself all the time.

351
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:27,760
I'm working to be a better
surgeon, a better boyfriend,

352
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:31,228
better at the things
I've chosen, but this...

353
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:33,696
other change,
it's unpredictable.

354
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:36,201
You don't choose it.
It just comes at you.

355
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:40,933
It's like hurricanes before 1873
when the Army Signal Corps

356
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,407
first put up flags to warn
people storms were coming.

357
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:46,001
Before that, houses were
flattened, lives destroyed,

358
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,240
and there was no way to
see it was heading for you.

359
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:53,719
Shaun, our relationship will
not end in natural disaster.

360
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:55,649
It did begin in one.

361
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,650
I'm going to look
in on my patient.

362
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:03,093
Okay.

363
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:13,335
Blood and saliva will tell
us if there is a genetic cause,

364
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:15,408
and the samples we
take from your house

365
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:17,443
will tell us if there is
something environmental.

366
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:21,780
I know it's stupid,

367
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:25,546
I've almost felt
guilty for my cancer,

368
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:29,680
like I arbitrarily decided
to be sick and burdensome.

369
00:21:32,158 --> 00:21:33,922
Do the people you're close to

370
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:36,258
ever act like you're
a burden to them?

371
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:37,796
You mean Alan.

372
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,194
He's scared.

373
00:21:42,268 --> 00:21:45,670
He takes the exit he's got
and he turns to his work.

374
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:47,838
You're okay with that?

375
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:58,307
I accept this compromise.

376
00:21:58,384 --> 00:22:02,651
That's not the hard part.
The hard part is... not knowing.

377
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,286
Each new thing that happens,

378
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:10,591
I worry, "Is this it? Is
this where I lose him?

379
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:13,898
Is this where he breaks?"

380
00:22:21,607 --> 00:22:23,303
So this is boiled coffee.

381
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:28,238
Some people call it Turkish coffee,
or Greek coffee, or Egyptian coffee.

382
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,374
Because we need to take
ownership and put things in categories.

383
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:32,507
Yeah.

384
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:37,122
Do you actually live in this thing?
In the hospital parking garage?

385
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,385
Why not? Convenient for work.

386
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:41,687
When I wanna spend a
few days off the beaten track,

387
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:43,720
convenient for that too.

388
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:46,524
Mm. I'm gonna get
three sips in this.

389
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,767
But three really great sips.

390
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:52,500
That's how I try
to live my life.

391
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:57,072
Try to appreciate,
savor, not pass by.

392
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:01,838
That what the
polyamory is about?

393
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,414
Does it really work?

394
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:07,179
Or is it one of those theories
about life that people regret later?

395
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,849
- No regrets so far.
- Mm-hm. No, I guess not.

396
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:13,358
Not while you're
young and having fun.

397
00:23:14,093 --> 00:23:17,063
It is fun. But not for the
reasons that you're thinking.

398
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:20,724
It isn't about sex. It's
about commitment.

399
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,028
Emotional connection.

400
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:25,561
The joy I'm sure you get out of
a relationship, I get a little more.

401
00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:29,164
Also, have to give a little
more. But that's meaningful too.

402
00:23:31,043 --> 00:23:32,043
Hmm.

403
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:36,380
You mind if I ask you something,
since we're getting personal?

404
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:41,613
Sure.

405
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:44,415
What's your favorite
misheard song lyric?

406
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:54,096
This is nice.

407
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,233
I'm glad it's not a date.

408
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:02,230
Me too. I don't believe
in those categories.

409
00:24:07,513 --> 00:24:10,210
He reported widespread
bilateral pain, then he keeled over.

410
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,614
BP dropped to 80 over palp.

411
00:24:11,684 --> 00:24:13,324
- I'll order a vasopressor.
- Already did.

412
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:16,287
Good. We need an EKG,
CBC, and chest images,

413
00:24:16,355 --> 00:24:17,846
and a new diagnosis.

414
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:20,859
Whatever he caused with
CRISPR, it's not just neuropathy.

415
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,758
Something else is killing him.

416
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:31,864
What if he's caused something

417
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:34,463
that mimics carcinomatous
autonomic neuropathy?

418
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,509
Explains the BP and bowel issue.

419
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:39,840
That doesn't explain the sensory
issue that led to the frostbite.

420
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:44,780
A connective tissue disorder?

421
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,285
That would've shown up on the
scans. His chest looks normal.

422
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:55,624
Maybe we can't think of the
answer because there is no answer.

423
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:57,494
We keep trying to jam
it into these categories

424
00:24:57,563 --> 00:24:58,929
and diseases that we know.

425
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:01,365
But this never existed before.

426
00:25:01,467 --> 00:25:03,527
He created a new
combination of genetic code,

427
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:05,365
that means a new
combination of symptoms.

428
00:25:05,471 --> 00:25:07,682
We shouldn't be looking
at what fits the picture

429
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:09,299
but at what's
closest to the picture

430
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:10,900
so we can figure
out a treatment.

431
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:14,378
And what it's closest
to is amyloidosis.

432
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,472
This isn't an
autoimmune neuropathy,

433
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:20,041
so the nerves must be under
attack by something else.

434
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:22,883
Something like amyloid disease
could leave deposits along the nerves,

435
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:24,583
causing the symptoms we've seen.

436
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,522
Where do we look
for those deposits?

437
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:28,550
In the spleen.

438
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,193
Drink all eight ounces.

439
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:39,498
We talked, we had a few laughs.

440
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:42,097
Oh, sounds date-y to me.

441
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,937
I don't think
Enrique's a player.

442
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,841
No, he's kind of the
opposite of a player.

443
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:48,403
With him, emotional
connection is the point.

444
00:25:48,514 --> 00:25:50,574
He's trying to live
some idealistic fantasy

445
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:52,427
where everyone is nice
and no one is jealous.

446
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:53,612
I am so staying away.

447
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:56,018
Well, of course. Once I
heard "emotional connection,"

448
00:25:56,088 --> 00:25:57,556
I knew the game was over.

449
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:00,958
What does that mean?
I'm against emotion?

450
00:26:01,627 --> 00:26:03,227
I'm not the one with
"cold-hearted bitch"

451
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:06,025
as my social media hashtag.
She's an excellent doctor.

452
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:07,623
Every time you've
loved somebody,

453
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:10,897
it's ended in disappointment
or death. Sometimes both.

454
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:12,062
It's like a reflex now.

455
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:15,266
You just expect that everything
ends badly, so why start?

456
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:19,106
So despite the many practical
reasons not to go out with a first-year,

457
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:22,204
this is all about me.
Is that a diamond ring?

458
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:25,377
I mean, it's pretty.

459
00:26:25,451 --> 00:26:27,079
The patient caught
her fiancé cheating,

460
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:28,950
big fight, he demanded
the ring back,

461
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:30,353
she swallowed it.

462
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,549
I did.

463
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:34,149
You don't even know if this is
going out, and that's the point.

464
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,627
It doesn't matter what Enrique's offering,
whether it's friendship or romance,

465
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:39,789
you're not investing.
You're risk-averse.

466
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:43,096
Your portfolio right now is
entirely in T-bills and money market.

467
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:44,602
I have no idea what that means.

468
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,468
It's too bad. A guy that
can make you laugh

469
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:48,564
might be just what
you need right now.

470
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:50,436
It's regressed to
your large intestine.

471
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:52,910
Here's a plastic bag.
Put it over the toilet seat.

472
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:55,607
You'll have every opportunity
to recover your property.

473
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:01,447
Don't run away from
a chance at love.

474
00:27:03,489 --> 00:27:04,582
It's a date.

475
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:08,417
Maybe. I don't know. Oh.

476
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:12,153
Their house is full of TCE.

477
00:27:12,598 --> 00:27:15,500
Side effect from chipmaking
back in Silicon Valley's early days.

478
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:17,593
So they move away
from their toxic home

479
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:20,503
- and hopefully things get a little better.
- Probably not much.

480
00:27:20,606 --> 00:27:22,541
She also has a
genetic predisposition.

481
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:23,802
It's both?

482
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:25,839
She shouldn't go
outside in a rainstorm.

483
00:27:27,346 --> 00:27:29,474
How do you tell a woman
that her third cancer

484
00:27:29,548 --> 00:27:31,346
likely won't be
close to her last?

485
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:36,517
Unfortunately, this
is a teaching moment.

486
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:42,018
Dr. Allen! After
12 hours on duty,

487
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:44,824
I can report that your
inserts came through.

488
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:47,126
Check your e-mail,
you'll find my testimonial.

489
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:49,133
Claire. Olivia.

490
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:59,368
And if you're right,
what will you do?

491
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,712
We'll treat the symptoms
with targeted drug therapies.

492
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:05,546
There really isn't a disease
as such that we can address.

493
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:14,316
- The pain shifted?
- Yeah.

494
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,586
- Oh!
- Never mind about the ultrasound.

495
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,375
It'll be easier to check for deposits
after the organ's been removed.

496
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:21,230
- After it's...
- Yeah.

497
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:23,700
His spleen's about to
rupture. Call the transport team.

498
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:39,042
It's called Li-Fraumeni
syndrome, LFS.

499
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:42,781
An inherited predisposition to
developing a wide range of cancers.

500
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:45,216
Yes, there was a toxin
in your environment

501
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,781
that likely played
a role in this,

502
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:49,361
but there will be other
triggers in the future.

503
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:51,553
Your body is super sensitive

504
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:54,361
and will respond with
tumors for the rest of your life.

505
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:06,101
I know that's a shock. But
here's what you should know.

506
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:10,277
Most cancers are treatable
if found early enough.

507
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:16,912
We know the most
common associated with LFS

508
00:29:17,022 --> 00:29:18,957
and we can do surveillance.

509
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:21,754
Nip anything in the bud
before it becomes a problem.

510
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:27,288
It may not seem this
way now, but this is good.

511
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:33,398
We know what we're dealing with.
We're warned, and we'll be ready.

512
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,843
He won't be able to handle this.

513
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,479
Liver, pancreas, other
organs look normal.

514
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:55,350
But there are calcified
lesions along these nerves.

515
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,622
He'll be in pain like
this for the rest of his life.

516
00:29:57,696 --> 00:30:02,134
No, there is a reasonable chance
it'll get worse as time goes on.

517
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,169
I need my sharp-blunt
curve scissors.

518
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:06,500
What if we use CRISPR
to reverse CRISPR?

519
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:11,138
Researchers have identified
a protein in certain bacteria

520
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:12,472
that inhibits CRISPR.

521
00:30:12,878 --> 00:30:15,507
What if we insert the DNA
that makes that protein

522
00:30:15,614 --> 00:30:16,843
into our patient's genome?

523
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:18,473
That would deactivate
the CRISPR gene.

524
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:20,074
So, CRISPR messed
him up permanently

525
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:21,984
and you think we
should do more of it?

526
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:23,734
Well, our patient
is a risk-taker.

527
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,450
We need a delivery mechanism,

528
00:30:25,524 --> 00:30:27,857
the code would have to be
introduced through a virus.

529
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:30,485
A virus that specifically
targets nerves.

530
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:36,158
- Well, polio targets nerves.
- Because this isn't risky enough.

531
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:39,363
Polio is such a dangerous virus
because it's so good at penetrating

532
00:30:39,471 --> 00:30:40,471
the nervous system.

533
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,190
Dr. Murphy?

534
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:07,861
She's going to be
this way... forever?

535
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:10,932
She'll have good
periods and bad periods,

536
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,766
but she will always
have to be on her guard.

537
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:18,172
Is she always gonna have to
be on guard against you too?

538
00:31:19,311 --> 00:31:20,540
What does that mean?

539
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:22,637
Chronic illness puts
strain on relationships.

540
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:26,946
Statistically, it is more often
the man who can't handle it.

541
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:29,021
Our marriage is
none of your business.

542
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:32,455
No, her health is my business.
And your behavior adds to her stress.

543
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,529
You look at her and
you imagine she's gone,

544
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,593
and that is hard, I get it.

545
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:45,398
But she thinks the same
thing when she looks at you.

546
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:48,931
I never complain to her.
I know it's nobody's fault.

547
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,305
You don't think she knows
you have trouble with all this?

548
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:55,605
Every time something
new happens, she wonders,

549
00:31:55,714 --> 00:31:59,276
"Is this the straw that is
going to break your marriage?"

550
00:32:00,552 --> 00:32:03,078
You've got her living in a
constant state of uncertainty.

551
00:32:03,188 --> 00:32:05,783
That is practically
the definition of stress.

552
00:32:07,826 --> 00:32:10,921
So this is the "straighten
up and fly right" lecture.

553
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:11,996
No.

554
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:15,798
I am...

555
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:21,900
I'm telling you to consider
how best to time your divorce.

556
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:26,105
There are gonna be a lot of
new issues dropping on Hannah,

557
00:32:26,211 --> 00:32:28,112
and if you're gonna
end up leaving anyway,

558
00:32:28,213 --> 00:32:30,978
- you should start planning now.
- I don't wanna leave my wife.

559
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:32,278
My best advice...

560
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:35,479
help her through this
next round of treatment

561
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:38,648
as best you can...
and then get out.

562
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:43,327
It's hard living with
someone who needs so much.

563
00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:47,830
I know you feel there is a point
where you have nothing left,

564
00:32:47,933 --> 00:32:49,526
where you're ready to break.

565
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:55,870
Just don't break when
she needs you most.

566
00:32:57,676 --> 00:32:59,440
Get out before that happens.

567
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:23,561
Reading an article
that's five years old?

568
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,695
Dr. Glassman was once
involved in an experimental attempt

569
00:33:26,805 --> 00:33:30,401
to treat Parkinson's with
CRISPR technology. It failed.

570
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:32,569
So it's both old,
and it didn't work.

571
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:35,169
Dr. Glassman likes his
failures to be informative,

572
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,044
that's why his
articles are longer.

573
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:39,310
Do you worry about
losing the people you love?

574
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:48,221
Because we can't stop
ourselves from changing,

575
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:50,693
which means we might
stop loving someone

576
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:53,890
or they might stop loving
us. It is a very bad thing.

577
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:56,193
It is.

578
00:33:58,837 --> 00:34:03,434
So no one can ever feel safe.

579
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:07,377
How can you keep going
if you never feel safe?

580
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,682
Well, sometimes not
changing is just as dangerous.

581
00:34:17,689 --> 00:34:20,853
So how do you know
when to do what?

582
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:25,726
If you find the answer
to that, let me know.

583
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:34,098
- I have it.
- You do?

584
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:37,073
Dr. Glassman used
varicella-zoster virus

585
00:34:37,142 --> 00:34:39,737
as the delivery mechanism,
which didn't work.

586
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:41,836
His first choice
was herpes simplex,

587
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:45,441
but the technology was not up to
putting their DNA package into it.

588
00:34:46,151 --> 00:34:49,121
The technology has
improved. It can be done.

589
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,153
Using conventional treatments,

590
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:58,958
there's nothing more
we can do for you.

591
00:34:59,064 --> 00:35:01,295
The pain will be permanent
and it could get worse.

592
00:35:03,168 --> 00:35:06,502
Well, I've not been one to
be limited by the conventional.

593
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,604
We think we can
reverse the CRISPR.

594
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:12,974
You want to reverse what I
did? My telomerase change?

595
00:35:13,078 --> 00:35:16,173
- No. They want to stop your pain.
- Soph, it's temporary.

596
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:18,876
And what is it, 40
years? That's nothing.

597
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,078
Our real lives are
ahead of us, okay?

598
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:22,814
Look, as long as
this doesn't kill me,

599
00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:26,483
I've made the right choice
no matter how bad things get.

600
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:27,820
No.

601
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:35,429
I was willing to exercise for
hours, and fast, to give up all sugar

602
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,163
and alcohol, and
do all the other things

603
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:40,204
that we needed to
do to get to a future

604
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:42,297
that I knew might never come.

605
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:49,910
But now you're asking me to watch
you suffer for the rest of your life?

606
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,691
You're the one who
embraces change.

607
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:07,561
So change to the person
who can be happy with me...

608
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,199
here and now.

609
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:21,706
Doctors, would you
mind waiting outside?

610
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:30,250
Why did she want us to leave?

611
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:33,725
I think she's
delivering an ultimatum.

Seems there's always something

00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:58,073
But this isn't like

658
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,077
Understood. But
life is about change,

659
00:39:45,183 --> 00:39:47,023
which means one day you
might change your mind,

660
00:39:47,085 --> 00:39:48,883
and if you did, I'd
be open to that too.

First, there should

Also, we need to stay

666
00:40:19,651 --> 00:40:22,712
so we don't accidentally knock
into the temperature control.

667
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:25,613
What changed your mind?

668
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:28,818
I've been thinking
about change over time.

669
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:32,295
I spoke with people and also
graphed several possibilities for us,

670
00:40:32,397 --> 00:40:35,595
using time as the horizontal
axis and change as the vertical.

671
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,295
I realized that the
problem isn't really change,

672
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:42,739
it's whether two people
change in the same direction.

673
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:45,072
We want to keep our
coordinates close to each other

674
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:46,634
for the rest of our lives.

675
00:40:48,346 --> 00:40:53,944
We certainly do. But people
do sometimes drift apart.

676
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:55,748
Yes. You need a warning

677
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,483
when you and your partner
might be starting to veer off

678
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:00,581
so you can both
change course a little.

679
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:02,923
You don't want a surprise
realization when it's too late.

680
00:41:02,994 --> 00:41:04,257
Surprises are awful.

681
00:41:04,329 --> 00:41:07,299
The U.S. Army Signal Corps
used flags to warn of hurricanes,

682
00:41:07,365 --> 00:41:08,594
I brought us this.

683
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:12,159
A cowbell?

684
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:15,331
If you see us heading
in different directions,

685
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:16,999
you ring it.

686
00:41:17,075 --> 00:41:19,476
Do we really need a
bell? Can't I just tell you?

687
00:41:19,544 --> 00:41:20,621
I mean...

688
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:24,241
Oh! When you ring it, I'll pay
attention. I really hate the sound.

689
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,384
Only in emergencies.

690
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,550
I've already moved
the shampoo bottles.

691
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:33,451
What?

692
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:38,524
Oh, you mean now?

<i>♪ Smoke's in our eyes

694
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:46,062
Don't worry about putting
the bottles back, I'll do it later.

695
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:48,272
I love you.

696
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:52,043
It's no trouble, I remember
where they all go.
