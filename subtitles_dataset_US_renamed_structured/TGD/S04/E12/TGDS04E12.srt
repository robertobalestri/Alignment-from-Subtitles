1
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,152
I couldn't sleep.

2
00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:25,554
You should start taking your
blood pressure every day.

3
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:30,360
That's very sweet
and responsible.

4
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:35,029
Yes. I am going to try to
be extra responsible now.

5
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:37,030
Yeah.

6
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:43,104
We have to talk about
what we... want to do.

7
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:49,115
I love you. I want a
child, so I want this child.

8
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:50,206
I love you too.

9
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:54,613
And I do want kids,
but it's complicated.

10
00:00:56,123 --> 00:01:00,026
Is this the right time in my
career? In our relationship?

11
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,988
Am I too young?
Can we afford this?

12
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,225
Am I willing to make this
commitment right now?

13
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:09,293
We can start depositing money
into a shared account for expenses,

14
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,895
and I can talk to Dr. Glassman
about hiring you an assistant

15
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:14,168
- to help with your workload.
- Shaun, just slow down.

16
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,710
I... I don't need you to
answer these questions now,

17
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:17,870
I just need to...

18
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,047
think, to figure out what to do.

19
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:22,849
And you do too.

20
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,690
Dr. Chambers, I'd like you
to meet our residents. This...

21
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,454
I know that I'm old, but I
can still read name tags.

22
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:38,327
Dr. Chambers, you started experiencing
aches in your right hand a month ago?

23
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:40,424
Then tremors, weakness, spasms.

24
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,231
Had to drop out in the middle
of a bowel resection last Friday.

25
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:44,794
I sent you a video
of the surgery.

26
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:46,772
Given your symptoms,
it seems carpal tunnel...

27
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,241
Oh, it "seems"? Well, then...

28
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:51,277
problem solved.

29
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:52,844
I'll be on my way.

30
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:57,146
Sir, can I just say that the documentary
on your work in Haiti changed my life.

31
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:58,549
It's the reason why I went to...

32
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,214
If you want to suck up to
me, call me "Doctor" not "sir."

33
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,257
And this is a hospital,
not Coachella.

34
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:07,419
If you can't wear something appropriate,
at least try something that fits.

35
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,762
Rule out autoimmune disorder,
hypothyroidism, diabetes,

36
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:17,634
amyloidosis, MS,
and multiple myeloma.

37
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:20,173
Then we'll get back
to carpal tunnel.

38
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:24,872
All right. If you have any
other questions or concerns,

39
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:26,777
- please don't hesitate to...
- Twelve.

40
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:30,477
First: I prefer blankets
not made of sandpaper.

41
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,746
Second: dim these damn lights.

42
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,381
This isn't some San Fernando
Valley porn shoot. Third...

43
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:38,652
If you made a list, you
don't need to tell us.

44
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:46,059
- He's had the pain for nine months now.
- And it's on both sides?

45
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:49,365
Sometimes his forehead.
Other times his cheeks, his nose.

46
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:51,769
It's persisting through very
high doses of hydrocodone?

47
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,433
Yeah, obviously the drugs
don't work. It's why I'm here.

48
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:55,508
Oscar.

49
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:57,535
It's a fair question.

50
00:02:58,378 --> 00:02:59,505
Look, I'm sorry.

51
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:03,945
Okay? I've been to six
doctors now. I can't work.

52
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:07,954
I mean, I... I can't even kiss
my wife. I can hardly smile.

53
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,649
I'm going to lightly
brush your cheek.

54
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,128
Okay.

55
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:20,026
Please, help me.

56
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:26,835
Been on the phone for an
hour with the cable company.

57
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:27,907
Lea's pregnant.

58
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,048
You want to have...

59
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,148
Yes.

60
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,882
Wow.

61
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:45,288
Okay. I'm glad
you're happy. Um...

62
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,691
- Do you have any concerns?
- Yes.

63
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:50,959
Sleep deprivation.

64
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:54,160
But I have started looking
into an affordable night nurse.

65
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,966
Well, there's going to
be some bigger issues.

66
00:03:58,038 --> 00:03:59,734
I mean, this is a...

67
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:05,776
This is a gigantic moment
for anyone, especially...

68
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:07,673
Especially for you.

69
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:08,772
You mean...

70
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,077
because of my ASD?

71
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:13,586
Yeah, because of your
ASD, because of your family...

72
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:18,755
Your job. I mean...

73
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:20,650
a million things.

74
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:23,653
I don't want to tell
you what... What to...

75
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,460
I mean, I don't
even know what I...

76
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:29,900
Having a child...

77
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,431
changes everything.

78
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,658
Nasal cavity's clear.

79
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:59,598
There's no abscess,
facial tumor, or sinusitis.

80
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,635
It could be acoustic neuroma.

81
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:04,569
- Without any hearing loss?
- Let's do an MRI to check.

82
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,664
We ran eight negative
tests. We don't need it.

83
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,709
We do the tests till
we know what he has.

84
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:10,300
It's fibromyalgia.

85
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:14,678
So your diagnosis for his pain is pain
that no one can explain? Well done.

86
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:16,580
Some pain's unavoidable.

87
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,118
When I was competing
in Taekwondo,

88
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:20,518
they taught us to adjust
our relationship to it,

89
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:22,427
learn to tolerate it. It
can make you stronger.

90
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:25,084
Wow. That statement
has the absolute ideal ratio

91
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,356
of heartlessness, humble-bragging,
and machismo. Bravo.

92
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,727
Seriously? You're
pleased with that?

93
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,732
"Machismo" is Spanish,
"bravo" is Italian,

94
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,496
and "humble-brag" is 2011.
We can do better, don't you think?

95
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:40,974
Maybe we're not finding anything
because it's psychological?

96
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,907
Some kind of
conversion disorder?

97
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:47,010
You do the MRI.
I'll talk to the wife.

98
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:51,516
Negative for endocrine issues.

99
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,015
He's got a history of
moderate carotid stenosis.

100
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,990
If enough plaque builds up,
starves the brain of oxygen,

101
00:05:58,058 --> 00:05:59,378
it could cause the
hand problems?

102
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:02,171
If it got that bad, we'd have
already seen signs of a stroke.

103
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,707
Anyone else annoyed that
we're wasting these resources

104
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,359
to confirm what's
clearly carpal tunnel?

105
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:08,664
He may be a jerk,
but he's a great doctor.

106
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,829
If Silas Chambers
has a medical opinion,

107
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:13,271
- we'd better check it out.
- I didn't think he was a jerk.

108
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:20,714
Dr. Andrews and Dr. Lim also
criticize us and have particular demands.

109
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,806
Yeah. They want us to improve.

110
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,875
How do you know
Dr. Chambers doesn't?

111
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,249
He did improve Enrique.

112
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:30,520
Not kidding. You look snazzy.

113
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:39,189
I know what Dr. Chambers has.

114
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:43,803
We're having trouble finding a
physical basis for your husband's pain.

115
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,368
And you defended me when I
asked him about pain killers earlier.

116
00:06:57,117 --> 00:07:00,485
A few years ago,
Oscar was on a job site.

117
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:04,247
Working crazy hours,
he was exhausted.

118
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:08,953
He shot himself with a nail
gun. Right through his palm.

119
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:16,295
We didn't have insurance, so
we went to this clinic, and, um...

120
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,130
Opioids?

121
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:23,470
Really bad. Took a
year for him to kick.

122
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,304
But now, um...

123
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:30,007
He's taking more
pills than ever.

124
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:33,509
Whenever I talk to
him about getting help,

125
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:37,420
he just gets mad. I, uh...

126
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,855
I had to move out last week.

127
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:45,258
I'm only here because
he asked me to.

128
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:50,161
I think he's faking.

129
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:58,272
You threw 113 sutures
in your last day of surgery.

130
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:00,837
In at least half, I detected
a very subtle tremor.

131
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:05,548
Congratulations on discovering
a symptom I told you about.

132
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:07,553
It occurs during
the part of your stitch

133
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,215
when the wrist is
straight, not when it's bent.

134
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,749
That's not carpal tunnel,
it is Musician's Dystonia.

135
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,921
My wrist flexes on every suture.

136
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,090
You're talking about a
difference of milliseconds.

137
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,291
Yes, he is.

138
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,398
Your condition was probably
caused by your repetitive technique.

139
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,702
Even Dr. Andrews throws sutures
in varied ways. You never do.

140
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:30,107
This kind of obsessive behavior
is common for those with autism.

141
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,805
- So I can refer...
- What did you just say?

142
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:37,149
I'm not autistic.

143
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,286
Dr. Murphy didn't
mean any offense.

144
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,853
- He himself is on the spectrum.
- Oh, is he?

145
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,832
I thought his robotic
voice and hand-clasping

146
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,528
were just charming affectations.

147
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:58,800
Do you really think I
am anything like him?

148
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:02,741
- I am not saying that...
- I am. You're extremely organized,

149
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:05,904
you hardly make eye contact,
and given your problems with food,

150
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:06,979
blankets, and lighting,

151
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,380
plus the fact you wear
headphones even in surgery,

152
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:10,974
you clearly have sensory issues.

153
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,679
I'm organized.

154
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,983
Would you rather I show up
in the O.R. and just wing it?

155
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:18,355
I have good taste in food and
music. Now that's a mental disorder?

156
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,026
And as for eye contact...

157
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:25,197
Okay.

158
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,758
I didn't come here
for a psych consult.

159
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:31,566
It was just an observation about
a possible reason for the behavior

160
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:34,767
that led to your hand symptoms,
which is what we should be talking about.

161
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:38,175
Physical therapy is the
recommended course for dystonia.

162
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,180
I'm not wasting months on
a treatment that won't work.

163
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:45,343
I want an MRI-guided ultrasound
ablation of the VO nucleus of the thalamus.

164
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,247
You want to jump
to brain surgery?

165
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:55,227
I would jump right to amputating
a toe if it got me my career back.

166
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,092
What were you thinking?

167
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:05,670
You just supported me.

168
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:10,438
Yes, because part of my job is not
yelling at residents in front of patients.

169
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,241
What you did is equivalent
to looking at a fuzzy MRI

170
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:16,647
- and blurting out a patient has cancer.
- Cancer can kill you.

171
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:22,516
Neither diagnosis is one
a patient is excited to hear.

172
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,921
Prep him for the ablation, and do
not talk to him again about autism.

173
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,198
He's seen six doctors
in the last month,

174
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:40,570
gotten three opioid prescriptions,
and he had a previous opioid problem.

175
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,903
It's textbook drug-seeking.

176
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,069
It's also textbook
a bunch of dingbats

177
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,204
missing a Trigeminal
Neuralgia diagnosis.

178
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:48,111
His wife agrees with
me. She knows him.

179
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:49,706
Would explain
why yours left you.

180
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:52,251
Snap. Except my
wife didn't leave me,

181
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,549
so neither a good point,
nor even a clever one.

182
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:57,989
FIESTA imaging would take hours to
set up, cost the patient serious money,

183
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:02,017
and still come out negative
because... it's textbook drug-seeking.

184
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:06,657
We have other patients who need
us. I'm sending the discharge order.

185
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:14,865
Hey.

186
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,676
I hate poop.

187
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,019
Like, what if I suck
at changing diapers?

188
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,583
Maybe we should start
with the bigger issues

189
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:34,321
and work our way down?

190
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,491
This isn't at the top of my
list, but since you are a doctor...

191
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:44,032
- Shaun's ASD, is it...?
- Inheritable?

192
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:49,874
Probably. But it's
unclear how much.

193
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:54,177
So even that... what am I
supposed to do with that?

194
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:55,247
Think it through.

195
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:59,250
Let's say you have
a little baby Shaun.

196
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,222
Like...

197
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:08,694
Tiny, honest, brilliant
guy who adores me...

198
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:11,731
Mini button-down...

199
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,701
teeny blue eyes...

200
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,864
And me?

201
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:23,642
A mom?

202
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,838
I mean, I'm not saying
my life would be worse,

203
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,610
but it would just be so different
from what I was planning.

204
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:34,450
Not that I was really planning,
but I am enjoying just...

205
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:37,022
being.

206
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:39,724
And so what if you wait?

207
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:42,794
I just want to make sure
I'm making the right decision.

208
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:51,298
I guess you'll
never really know.

209
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,966
I had to make a lot of hard
choices about my mom...

210
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:02,805
and I still wake up wondering
which of them went the wrong way.

211
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:06,018
But...

212
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:08,987
you still gotta choose.

213
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:24,362
No abnormal signal
in the mid pons.

214
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,207
So are you and Dr. Park
like this at home too?

215
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:31,039
When I let him out of
his cage for meals, yes.

216
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:33,070
Hey. We're almost...

217
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:38,617
Oh, come on.

218
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,711
Did you not get the
text I didn't send?

219
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:42,881
Don't bother asking for
consults if you're going...

220
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:46,790
Wait, what's that on the right
superior cerebellar artery?

221
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,834
An abnormal loop
causing compression.

222
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:59,031
He has Trigeminal
Neuralgia. The pain's real.

223
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,402
We have good visualization
of the target area.

224
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,913
Connect the ultrasound
to the stereotactic frame.

225
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,159
Ablation won't work.

226
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:31,132
You changed your mind?
You don't think he has dystonia?

227
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,230
He does, but it's a symptom.

228
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:37,334
His vertebral artery
takes an aberrant course.

229
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:42,143
It is pressing against his spinal cord.
He needs vascular surgery or he'll die.

230
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,709
It's a disorder of the nerve

231
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:49,278
that carries sensation
from the face to the brain,

232
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:52,018
and it's one of the most
painful conditions that exists.

233
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:53,457
And very hard to diagnose.

234
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:55,859
Thank God Dr. Park
approved all those tests.

235
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:00,798
You... You were in agony...

236
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:03,168
And I...

237
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,404
I told them I thought
you were lying.

238
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,875
You thought I was lying?

239
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,052
You thought I was
just being an addict?

240
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:24,580
Still you came here with me.

241
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:28,786
Sat at my side...

242
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:35,468
We'd like to do a
microvascular decompression.

243
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:38,334
We'd go in through the back of
your skull and put in a Teflon patch

244
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:41,033
to cushion the affected nerve.

245
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,008
You're... You're
cutting into his brain?

246
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:44,441
It's relatively safe,

247
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,911
and other options are
unlikely to relieve the pain.

248
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:51,846
Look, I'll do it.
Thank you so much.

249
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,813
We want to run a
vertebral artery BTO.

250
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,755
If you tolerate it, then
we would sacrifice...

251
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:01,226
Sacrifice the vessel
with onyx embolization.

252
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,525
We recognize you might
not love this proposal.

253
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:05,656
The one in which my
hand weakness remains,

254
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:06,731
destroying my career?

255
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:11,394
Did you consider
vertebral-to-vertebral artery bypass

256
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,736
with physical removal
of the aberrant artery?

257
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:17,675
Mm-hm. That would carry a
very high risk for a stroke or bleed.

258
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:21,145
It would fix the dystonia
and let me get back to work.

259
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:23,581
With your history
of carotid stenosis,

260
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,880
it would be a coin flip
whether you survive.

261
00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:29,616
I can live with those numbers.
Or for that matter, die with them.

262
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:36,453
Corridor to the trigeminal
nerve origin is open.

263
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:40,023
I freed up the offending
vessel. Teflon sponge.

264
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,732
The sponge is too big. It'll
compress the brain stem.

265
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:46,739
- I have at least four millimeters of room.
- You have half that.

266
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:50,004
- You have a better view 50 feet away.
- How long have they been like this?

267
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:52,102
A while. It's getting
worse, though.

268
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,409
Sorry, Park, you're
right. Just like you were

269
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,278
when you decided to
discharge the sick guy.

270
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,750
Wow, you invented
sarcasm. Really impressive.

271
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:01,253
- Hey, look at me, I'm using it too.
- Park,

272
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,779
you missed the diagnosis.
Reznick, you ignored protocol.

273
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,656
How about you both show
some humility and shut up?

274
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:11,421
Sorry. Teflon's placed.

275
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:14,258
What if we use the
saphenous vein for the bypass?

276
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,360
- Not enough flow, he'll stroke out.
- Carotid to distal vert, then?

277
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:19,405
Stenosis is too severe.

278
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:22,601
Dude's loaded. He's
at retirement age.

279
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:25,804
He could teach, travel,
screw around all day.

280
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,403
Why is he demanding
that we do this?

281
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,612
When you dedicate your life to
something that gives you meaning...

282
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:35,449
Starts to define you. His
decision may be irrational,

283
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:36,521
but I get it.

284
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:38,390
I don't think it is irrational.

285
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:44,359
Dr. Chambers has no
friends, no children, no family,

286
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,865
no outside interests. If
he can't be a surgeon,

287
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:48,026
he'll have nothing.

288
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,129
I think our best
bet is a radial graft.

289
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:54,696
Highest flow I can think of.

290
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,075
Any other ideas?

291
00:17:57,877 --> 00:18:00,108
Okay. We go with
the radial graft.

292
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,415
I'm impressed.

293
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:12,583
I was actually starting to
wonder if I was losing my touch.

294
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:16,287
But then I had a dark afternoon
of the soul and suddenly I knew it.

295
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,898
Those were totally solid burns.

296
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:22,265
Maybe not A plus, but A
minus, B plus at the worst.

297
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:24,430
So it hit me,

298
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:27,838
your plan was to throw me off
my game, make me doubt myself.

299
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:29,136
I'm attracted to you.

300
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:35,081
I have been fighting this stupid
feeling, trying to find reasons to not...

301
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:37,882
feel...

302
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,123
Are you kidding me?

303
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:54,499
Yes.

304
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:57,835
Your jokes were lame. And
that's how you screw with someone.

305
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:00,672
No.

306
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:03,302
You're not that good of a liar.

307
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,671
I can't have a roommate
who has feelings for me.

308
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:10,979
- Since when can't you take a joke?
- Since my roommate hit on me.

309
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,983
You have to move out...
as soon as possible.

310
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:32,168
We've decided to use your
radial artery for the graft.

311
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:34,139
We've scheduled an
O.R. for tomorrow morning.

312
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:35,970
- Good call.
- I agree.

313
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:38,011
You should risk your
life for this surgery.

314
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:42,744
- Are you being facetious?
- No.

315
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,482
It just boggles the mind.

316
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:50,183
You can't understand
what anyone means.

317
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:52,384
You can't express
yourself like an adult.

318
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:57,260
You're a child playing dress-up,
and everyone here just plays along.

319
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:58,329
Let's go, Shaun.

320
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:00,829
- You're agitated.
- I'm fine.

321
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:03,964
You are rubbing your mug.

322
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,905
People with ASD often
have comfort objects

323
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:10,533
for when they become agitated.
I can order you propranolol.

324
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:13,878
You're going to give me
the Ruseckas-Freedman

325
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:15,437
ASD Diagnostic Questionnaire,

326
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,779
and that's going to
shut your damn mouth.

327
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,478
Okay, the "Rafad-Q"
is just a tool.

328
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:22,647
An official diagnosis needs
to come from a psychiatrist.

329
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:26,022
Well, since I might be dead
tomorrow, this is your next best option.

330
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:33,095
I'll... get the test.

331
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:38,997
Why can't you treat people
with an ounce of respect?

332
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:42,371
Respect has to be earned,
not doled out like candy.

333
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:45,969
No, that's an excuse people like you
use to justify your garbage behavior.

334
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:49,209
That's just an excuse people
like you use to avoid facing reality.

335
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:53,011
No one was respectful to
me when I was a resident.

336
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,611
They were dismissive and cruel,

337
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:59,090
but it lit a fire and it made
me the man I am today,

338
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:01,718
the man that you came
into my room idolizing.

339
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:05,525
- Not anymore.
- I'm devastated.

340
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:12,337
Surgeons deal in human
lives, not childish fantasies.

341
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:14,134
If you want to succeed,

342
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,107
you're going to have
to be a lot more like me.

343
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:31,120
- Everything okay?
- Yep.

344
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,749
Surgery went very smoothly.

345
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:34,486
No pain right now.

346
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,495
Want to take it
for a test drive?

347
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:55,513
It's worse.

348
00:21:58,217 --> 00:22:01,244
Collateral circulation
is not ideal.

349
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,221
How are we going
to harvest the artery?

350
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:08,126
What's going on?

351
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:12,591
How much am I going to have to
change who I am to be a surgeon?

352
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:16,899
Well, to be great, or even good at
anything, we have to compromise.

353
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:21,804
I used to get too emotionally
involved in my work,

354
00:22:21,874 --> 00:22:24,139
with patients, everyone.

355
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,179
I had to learn to
distance myself.

356
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:28,544
Yeah, you've really
grown cold and heartless.

357
00:22:28,614 --> 00:22:31,379
I have changed. We
all end up changing.

358
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,747
You gotta try and
make it a good change.

359
00:22:37,223 --> 00:22:38,486
Well, I don't want to change.

360
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:43,523
I want to change
what's around me.

361
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:50,033
- I'll... I'll figure it out.
- I'm sure you will.

362
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:53,228
Hey, you're the guy who
makes living in a van look cool.

363
00:22:56,075 --> 00:22:57,634
So the circulation...

364
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,043
The right side looks
like it has better length.

365
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,215
Yeah. Better collateral too.

366
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,787
Given the poor outcome,

367
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:12,051
we can't recommend
further surgery right now.

368
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:14,116
We suggest six months
of pain medication

369
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:17,391
and referrals to neurology and
pain management specialists.

370
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:21,633
What surgery aren't
you recommending?

371
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,861
A DREZ lesioning.

372
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,371
We'd cut the signal
from the trigeminal nerve

373
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:26,962
to the sensory
areas of your brain,

374
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:31,272
but there's a real possibility of
paralysis on one side of your body.

375
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:33,774
I want the surgery.

376
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:37,408
Baby, I'll help you
manage the pain. I...

377
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:39,112
I'll move back in.

378
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,251
I'll take care of you.

379
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:43,916
You know how I
treated you before.

380
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:47,221
I'm only going to get worse.

381
00:23:48,294 --> 00:23:50,422
I would never leave you again.

382
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:53,625
That's what scares me.

383
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:58,431
I'd start cutting you
down, being cruel.

384
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:01,339
And you'd just put up with it.

385
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:05,574
I won't let that happen.

386
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:11,278
We'll prep an O.R.

387
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:17,414
"I frequently point out
other people's mistakes."

388
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,316
Duh. That's a yes.

389
00:24:21,694 --> 00:24:23,856
"People tell me I
overthink things."

390
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:27,366
Only people who underthink
things. But fine, another yes.

391
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:30,198
"I sometimes speak
in an abnormal tone."

392
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:32,204
Who thinks they speak
in an abnormal tone?

393
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:33,603
Just mark no.

394
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:35,766
- How many more of these?
- None.

395
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:40,172
Your answers are fully congruent
with someone on the spectrum.

396
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:43,882
No. You keyed it wrong.

397
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:46,817
- No. Look. No, I... Look, I didn't.
- Or something. Here, no.

398
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:49,320
- Give it to me. Don't!
- See... No.

399
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:55,087
You idiot! Stupid, careless...

400
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,152
- I... I stepped back...
- Get out of my room!

401
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,523
- Get out!
- Okay.

402
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:10,006
<i>Make sure we're not impacting
normal spinal cord pathways.</i>

403
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:11,703
<i>Somatosensories are at baseline.</i>

404
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:13,040
BP's steady.

405
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:19,950
Leg and arm SSEPs at 50
percent decreased amplitude.

406
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,682
Check the cord above and below
for hematoma or bony compression.

407
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:26,450
Cord's fine. Push IV
fluids and start pressors.

408
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,584
So, what is it?

409
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,560
I don't know.

410
00:25:36,435 --> 00:25:39,462
- Any issues with motor potentials?
- Unilateral amplitude down 70 percent.

411
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,734
We're about to get total
neurological collapse.

412
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:43,537
<i>A clot from a branch artery.</i>

413
00:25:43,609 --> 00:25:45,441
<i>We checked the
spinal blood vessels.</i>

414
00:25:45,511 --> 00:25:48,310
The outside. But the electrode
could have injured a sulcal artery.

415
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,441
<i>We need to follow the DREZ pathway
inward and search for a small clot.</i>

416
00:25:51,517 --> 00:25:53,816
Start at the site of last
ablation with the electrodes.

417
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:55,411
It's gotta be deep.

418
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:58,179
This'll be easier
if she's in here.

419
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,582
Scrub in, Dr. Reznick.

420
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:09,532
We're setting up the
neuromonitoring for Silas' surgery.

421
00:26:13,205 --> 00:26:15,333
- He's angry with me.
- Silas?

422
00:26:16,442 --> 00:26:17,808
He's angry with everyone.

423
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:20,710
Dr. Andrews said to stop
talking to him about ASD,

424
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:22,907
but I brought it up
anyway, gave him a test.

425
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:26,713
His mug broke, and I
don't know what to do now.

426
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:28,651
I don't know what
to feel. And Lea...

427
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:34,985
Lea told me about the pregnancy.

428
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:52,945
Is this hard for me because I'm
dealing with both things at once?

429
00:26:55,414 --> 00:26:57,474
I think both things are related.

430
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,083
What if my child...

431
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:05,622
has no friends?

432
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:07,992
What if they're picked on?

433
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:11,292
This is not small-town Wyoming.
The world has changed, Shaun.

434
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:14,595
I haven't changed. How can I...

435
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:20,931
know what they're feeling?
How can I comfort them?

436
00:27:23,709 --> 00:27:25,507
How can I be a good father?

437
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,550
Remember when we first met?

438
00:27:32,618 --> 00:27:33,916
Right over there?

439
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:37,454
You were mad at me.

440
00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:39,822
Yeah, but you were
right about the patient.

441
00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:44,920
And you were stubborn, and crazy smart.
And you are still all of those things.

442
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,331
But...

443
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:52,804
if you were still just that guy that I
met running through those doors,

444
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:55,136
we would not be
sitting here right now.

445
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,235
You have changed.

446
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:02,747
You've adapted, you've grown.

447
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,213
Do you know how hard that
is? Most people don't even try.

448
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:15,594
And you are going to
grow into a great father.

449
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:18,063
Whenever it happens.

450
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,875
Slowly go perpendicular at the
angle of our ablation electrode.

451
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:40,782
Still not seeing the clot.

452
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:43,720
Amplitude loss at 80 percent.

453
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:45,155
Maybe it's not a clot.

454
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:47,193
Maybe it's something
higher up in the brain.

455
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:49,091
No. You were
right the first time.

456
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:54,025
Maybe it's hiding behind some
ultrasound-impervious segment.

457
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:56,928
Cut the dentate ligament.

458
00:28:58,003 --> 00:28:59,301
It'll get more lateral access.

459
00:29:00,372 --> 00:29:01,738
Completely section the ligament.

460
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:07,402
I see it.

461
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:11,182
Removing the clot.

462
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,579
Amplitude returning
to normal baseline.

463
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,621
Let me know if you need me.

464
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:27,962
We're good. Thank you.

465
00:29:34,306 --> 00:29:35,433
Hey.

466
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:39,773
- We did good together.
- We did.

467
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:43,813
You still have to move
out though. Tonight.

468
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,651
On my first day here,
Dr. Melendez said

469
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:59,527
I would never do
anything besides suction,

470
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:01,999
but later he let me make
my first surgical incision.

471
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:05,865
He became my friend. I miss him.

472
00:30:06,872 --> 00:30:08,773
Are you in the right room?

473
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,504
Did somebody tell you I
needed pointless stories?

474
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:18,574
I used to think being a doctor
was all I needed to make me happy.

475
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:22,820
It did make me happy.

476
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:26,387
But I realized I wanted more.

477
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:29,491
And that I could have more.

478
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:33,688
I changed.

479
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:38,527
You can change too,

480
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:41,336
but not if you're dead
from this surgery.

481
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:45,676
I've made up my mind.

482
00:30:47,112 --> 00:30:48,171
Please leave.

483
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:54,176
My brother Steve, he gave me
a plastic scalpel before he died.

484
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:57,552
- It broke. I was very sad.
- I asked you to leave.

485
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:07,333
When I fixed my scalpel
it made me feel better.

486
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:25,680
I was 9 years old
when my father died.

487
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:32,886
I loved drinking hot chocolate
with him in the morning.

488
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:37,020
He'd bring me a mug
after every business trip.

489
00:31:38,797 --> 00:31:39,958
He understood me.

490
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:43,666
My mother didn't. Nobody did.

491
00:31:45,504 --> 00:31:48,372
I tried fitting in, but...

492
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:54,103
I got frustrated,
so... I gave up.

493
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,976
On relationships, on friends,

494
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:03,078
on all but the one
thing I was good at.

495
00:32:05,824 --> 00:32:08,760
And now,
Dr. Murphy, I'm too old.

496
00:32:08,827 --> 00:32:12,491
I've made too many
enemies, too many mistakes.

497
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:16,258
People tolerate me

498
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:19,262
because I save lives.

499
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:24,834
Without that...

500
00:32:26,578 --> 00:32:30,345
why would anyone
ever care about me?

501
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,120
I care.

502
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:17,756
That smells good.

503
00:33:19,264 --> 00:33:20,264
Bland.

504
00:33:22,267 --> 00:33:25,897
Pasta with olive oil.
Kind of puke-proof.

505
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:29,998
Have you thought
any more about...

506
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:31,809
Yes.

507
00:33:37,282 --> 00:33:38,282
I made a list.

508
00:33:53,665 --> 00:33:55,224
I guess I learned from you.

509
00:34:03,942 --> 00:34:05,877
What's the first
thing yours says?

510
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,450
That I think I would
be a good father.

511
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:18,516
But that I can't know for sure.

512
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:21,851
You'd make a great dad.

513
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,219
It's on my list.

514
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:34,738
You were right.

515
00:34:36,975 --> 00:34:38,466
It is very complicated.

516
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:41,378
But...

517
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:43,581
I do know...

518
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:48,746
I want you to be happy, Lea.

519
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:56,426
I have so many
reasons to do this...

520
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,260
and so many doubts.

521
00:35:04,169 --> 00:35:06,070
I'm just scared, Shaun.

522
00:35:08,907 --> 00:35:09,907
But...

523
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:14,979
If we are both having
doubts, then maybe now...

524
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:18,076
isn't the right time.

525
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:24,488
Okay.

526
00:36:11,403 --> 00:36:12,632
Mm.

527
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:16,141
I see that my hemoglobin's
stable and my white count is fine.

528
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:19,334
Yeah. We just wrote
your discharge orders.

529
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:22,677
This is a referral for
an ASD specialist.

530
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:26,642
I can look into that on my own.

531
00:36:39,464 --> 00:36:40,830
Thank you, Dr. Murphy.

532
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:44,862
And thank you, Dr. Guerin.

533
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:57,981
Welcome back.

534
00:37:05,857 --> 00:37:06,857
Did it work?

535
00:37:08,026 --> 00:37:09,358
Let's find out.

536
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,404
Your hand's cold.

537
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:49,066
I'm transferring out.

538
00:37:50,068 --> 00:37:52,162
Last year I applied to a
program at Johns Hopkins.

539
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:55,830
They train doctors to travel the
world to help out in needy areas.

540
00:37:56,908 --> 00:37:58,240
And they'll let me enroll late.

541
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,769
Sounds like a
good place for you.

542
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:07,843
Thanks for always being a
great boss. And a great friend.

543
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:11,815
Can't have been that
great. Sneaking out like this.

544
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,684
Uh, actually, for the first
time I can remember...

545
00:38:16,361 --> 00:38:17,659
feels hard to say goodbye.

546
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:30,673
You're always doing so
much for other people.

547
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:34,610
Please don't forget to do something
for yourself every now and then.

548
00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:58,868
Were you messing with me or not?

549
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:07,612
If I was, would you let me stay?

550
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:13,383
Yes.

551
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:19,119
I wasn't messing with you.

552
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,725
Then I guess it's good we're
not roommates anymore.

553
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:33,270
Because I couldn't do this.

554
00:39:37,342 --> 00:39:38,674
This is a one-time thing.

555
00:39:39,444 --> 00:39:43,211
Unless I change my mind,
so consider that an incentive.

Lea Dilallo?

567
00:40:55,086 --> 00:40:57,521
She... called your name.

568
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:06,159
I spent all day reminding myself

569
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:09,496
of all the reasons why
this was a good idea.

570
00:41:13,004 --> 00:41:14,939
But now that it's
actually happening, it...

571
00:41:16,374 --> 00:41:18,036
doesn't make me feel any better.

572
00:41:18,109 --> 00:41:20,738
It just makes me
feel really sad.

573
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:31,453
Maybe it's not the right
time, but will it ever be?

574
00:41:47,572 --> 00:41:49,006
Feel the same.

575
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:56,508
Are we really doing this?

576
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:01,251
We...

577
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:04,588
are having a baby.

Okay.

584
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:26,370
Okay.
